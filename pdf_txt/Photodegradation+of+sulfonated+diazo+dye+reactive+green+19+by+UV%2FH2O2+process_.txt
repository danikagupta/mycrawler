The anodic oxidation of diazo dyes on boron-doped di amond (BDD) electrodes in the presence of chloride 
was investigated. Reactive Green 19 (RG19), a relative ly new diazo dye of high structural complexity, was 
used as a model dye. To evaluate the effect of the operating parameters on dec olorization, electrolyses 
under galvanostatic conditions were performed in a me mbrane-free reactor. The results obtained suggest 
the simultaneous occurrence of a r eaction mediated by hydroxyl radicals and a reaction mediated by 
active chlorine. The first reaction was found to be favored by increasing current density and temperature, 
while the second was promoted by acidic pH and by increasing chloride concentration and stirring rate. 
Several kinetic models were tested for their ability to correlate the experimental data. The best results 
were obtained by a power-law model including all the par ameters of interest and using the time required to 
achieve 50% or 99% color removal as response variab les. From the estimated model coefficients, the 
contribution of each operating parameter to RG19 decolorization at shorter and longer times was 
determined. 
1. Introduction 
Reactive diazo dyes are a class of compounds extensively used in the textile industry for their bright colors and resistance to fading. During the dy eing process, a competition occu rs between the fixing reaction and 
the hydrolysis of the reactive group in the dye molecule, which results in a significant release of unfixed 
dye in the wastewater (Lewis et al., 2000). Due to the huge volume of effluents produced and the strong 
coloration imparted by even negligible amounts of dy e, the environmental impact of textile wastewaters 
represents an issue of major concern (Caselatto et al ., 2011). In fact, in additi on to the toxicity and 
potential cancerogenity of azo dyes, their presence in water bodies can reduce sunlight penetration and 
dissolved oxygen concentration, with deleteri ous effects on local flora and fauna.  
For the above reasons, efforts are currently being devote d to finding practical and efficient solu tions for the 
treatment of dye-containing wastew aters. In the field of advanced oxidation processes, the anodic 
oxidation on highly performant electrode materials, su ch as the boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode, is 
attracting a great deal of attention. This anode present s unique characteristics in terms of electrochemical 
stability and resistance to chemical degradation. Moreover, its high ov erpotential for oxygen evolution 
allows the electrogeneration of large amounts of hydr oxyl radicals that are slightly adsorbed on the 
electrode surface. Among the numerous applications of BDD electrodes, water disinfection (Petrucci et al., 
2013), the removal and mineralisation of organic (Scial done et al., 2008; Oturan et al., 2012) and inorganic 
(Montanaro et al., 2008) pollutants in aqueous solution and the treatment of  real wastewaters (Tsantaki et 
al., 2012) have been the object of recent investigations. In the anodic oxidation of dyes on BDD electrod es, the presence of chlorides, even at very low 
concentrations, can significantly enhance the decolor ization rate, due to the high selectivity of the 
electrogenerated active chlorine for the chromophore groups (Montanaro and Petrucci, 2009). In the presence of chlorides, the reaction mediated by the electrogenerated active chlorine and that mediated by 
the hydroxyl radicals produced on BDD surface by water discharge occur simultaneously, leading to dye

121decolorization and degradation. However, little att ention has so far been devoted to evaluating the 
influence of individual process parameters upon the two reactions. 
The main aim of the present work was to assess the contribution of the mo st important operating 
parameters, that is, dye and chloride concentrations, current density, pH, temperature and stirring rate, to 
the anodic oxidation of azo dyes on BDD electrodes. To this end, the sulfonated diazo dye Reactive Green 
19 (RG19) was used as a model compound. The comple x chemical structure of RG19, a high-molecular 
weight (Mw = 1418.9 g mol–1) dye with two azo groups and two reactive chlorotriazine groups in its 
molecule, makes it an ideal candidate for this type of studies. Furthermore, attempts to degrade this dye 
by microbial (Saratale et al., 2009), photocatalytic (Rastegar et al., 2012) or UV/H 2O2 (Zuorro et al., 2013a) 
as well as the use of adsorbents (Zuorro et al., 2013b) have met only limited success. 
To investigate the electrochemical oxidation kineti cs of RG19 on BDD electrodes, the time required to 
achieve 50% or 99% decolorization was determined u nder different process conditions. Decolorization 
data were modelled by a power-law model and statistically analysed in order to evaluate the contribution of 
each parameter to the decolorization process. 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Materials 
Unless otherwise indicated, sample solutions were pr epared by dissolving in distilled water the appropriate 
amount of RG19 of technical grade (C 40H23Cl2N15Na6O19S6, color index number 205075, from 
Gammacolor Srl), 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 and 0.01 M NaCl. Adjustments of pH were made using 96% H 2SO 4 and 
0.1 M NaOH. Reagents were supplied by Carlo Erba (Milano, Italy) and Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, 
USA) and were used without any further purification. 
2.2  Electrochemical degradation experiments 
The electrolytic cell was a cylindrical undivided reac tor. The anode was a BDD electrode with a rectangular 
surface of 5 cm2 (Adamant Technologies) while the cathode was a commercial platinum wire (AMEL). 
They were placed in parallel at 1 cm of distance. 10 0 mL of dye solution were treated in each run. During 
the electrochemical treatment, the cell wa s thermostated and the electrolyte was  magnetically stirred. The 
experiments were carried out under galvanostatic conditions using an AMEL 2051 potentiostat. 
2.3 Analytical methods 
The solution pH and conductivity were measured using a Crison GLP 421 and a Hanna Instrument 
HI87314. Absorbance was measured using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (T80+ PG Instruments Ltd., 
Leicester, UK). RG19 decolorization was monitored by withdrawing about 3 mL of liquid samples at 
selected time intervals and calculating the degree of color removal (R%) as:  
00100 %AA ARt−⋅ =  (1) 
where A 0 and A t are the absorbance values, at time 0 and t, of the dye solution at 630 nm, where the 
absorption spectrum of the dye disp lays a sharp peak (Zuorro and Lavecchia, 2014). After analysis, the 
sample was immediately returned into the reactor.  
Regression and statistical analysis was performed us ing Minitab® version 16.2.3 (State College, PA). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Effect of operating parameters on dye decolorization 
A large number of tests were performed to evaluate th e effect of the main operating parameters on the 
degradation efficiency. In these experiments, chloride  concentration was varied between 0 and 0.05 M, 
current density between 100 and 500 A m–2, pH between 3 and 11, temperature between 10 and 45 °C 
and stirring rate between 250 and 750 rpm. All runs were  carried out in aqueous solutions containing 0.05 
M sodium sulfate and a concentration of  RG19 ranging from 50 to 150 mg L–1. Some representative results 
are shown in Figure 1.  
From the results obtained, it can be seen that the addition of chloride greatly enhanced the decolorization 
of RG19, which can be ascribed to the synergistic e ffect of the indirect ox idation mediated by the 
electrogenerated active chlorine. In the presence of sodium chloride, decolorization was almost complete within the first 15 min of treatment, while in its absence a residual dye concentration was still found after six hours of electrolysis (data not shown). As expected, increasing current density was also beneficial, this effect being a result of the increased production of hydroxyl radicals and active chlorine. In particular, the 
122time of decolorization was approximately halved (from 23 to 11 min) as the current density was raised from 
300 to 500 A m–2. The use of more acidic conditions resulted in a dramatic improvement in the reaction 
efficiency, the color removal reaching about 90%. Afterwards, the reaction ra te underwent an abrupt 
decrease and complete decolorization was achieved in times comparable with those observed at higher 
pH. This trend was also observed at pH 4 and 5 (data not shown), confirming that  two different reactions 
prevail at different treatment time intervals. Since pH  strongly influences the equilibrium distribution of 
active chlorine species, favoring hypochlorous acid, wh ich is an oxidizing agent stronger than hypochlorite, 
while •OH radicals are rather insensitive to this param eter, the results obtained suggest that the reaction 
mediated by active chlorine prevails at the initial stage of dye degradation. In contrast, the reaction 
mediated by hydroxyl radicals becomes prevalent only when most of the dye molecules have been 
degraded. We also note that a decrease in the stirri ng rate, after an initial negative effect, leads to 
complete decolorization with a slight time delay. This  behavior can be explained by considering that, under 
the conditions employed, the active chlorine conc entration becomes limiting and the attack to the 
chromophore, occurring in the initial stage, is favored by stirring. This effect seems to diminish when the prevailing reaction is that mediated by hydroxyl radicals. 
3.2 Kinetic modeling of decolorization 
A preliminary analysis of the experimental data sh owed that the decolorization process cannot be 
described by most common reaction rate expressions, su ch as the first-order or the zero-order kinetics, 
thus corroborating the hypothesis that diffe rent reactions take place simultaneously. 
In consideration of the fact that t he previously mentioned reactions prevai l at different treatment times, the 
time intervals required to achieve 50% ( τ
50) and 99% ( τ99) decolorization were determined from the 
experimental curves (see Figure 1). Different empirical models were then used to describe the 
dependence of τ50 or τ 99 on dye and chloride concentrations, current  density (J), temperature (T), pH and 
stirring rate (u). The best results were obtained by the following power-law expressions:

coefficients associated to each independent variable and a0 is an empirical constant. For both responses, 
eq. (2) provided a more accurate fit and was theref ore used to evaluate the six unknown parameters ( ai).  
Parameter estimation was carried out by least-squares fitting of the data after linearization of eq. (2). Their 
values are listed in Table 1 together with their standard errors, t statistics and p -values. As apparent from 
the dispersion plot in Figure 2, the calculated values were in good agreement with the experimental 
results, and the points were uniforml y distributed around the bisecting li ne. The resulting coefficient of 
determination (R2), adjusted-R2 and prediction-R2 were equal to 98.6%, 98.3% and 97.8%, for τ50, and 
99.6%, 99.5% and 99.4%, for τ99, respectively. Analysis of residuals showed no apparent departures from 
basic ANOVA assumptions, i.e., normally distributed erro rs with constant variance and independent of one 
another (Figure 3).

Figure 4: Estimated model coefficients showi ng the effect of each independent variable on τ
50 and τ99 
From Table 1, it can be seen that the estimated model coefficients were all statistically significant at the 
99% confidence level (p < 0.01), with the exception of the coefficient associated to pH, for τ99, which was 
significant at the 90% confidence le vel (p < 0.1). It should be noted that the absolute value of each 
coefficient gives an indication of the contribution of the associated variable to the response variable. A 
positive coefficient indicates t hat the variable increases the τ-value (i.e., negati vely affects the 
decolorization kinetics), while the opposite holds for negative values of the coefficient.  
Examination of Table 1 and Figure 4 reveals that th e initial concentration of  RG19, unlike other dyes 
investigated by the same workgroup (Montanaro and Petrucci, 2009), severely slows down the 
decolorization rate, especially when the reactions procee d to completion. A detrimental effect can also be 
observed for pH, which is more pronounced at lower times. In contrast, chloride addition had a positive 
effect on decolorization, which was more marked in t he initial phase of the decolorization process. Also 
increases in temperature and current density were benef icial to decolorization, with comparable effects on τ50

125τ50 and τ 99. As regards temperature, it should be noted tha t, although an increase in temperature promotes 
the evolution of gaseous chlorine, thus negatively affecting the concentration of active chlorine, it also 
improves the diffusion of the reacting species from t he bulk of the solution to the electrode surface, and 
vice versa, with a net effect depending on the importance of each contribution. 
The effect of agitation deserves particular attention. In fact, while at low conversions the stirring rate 
influenced positively the decolorization process, an opp osite effect was observed at high conversions. A 
possible explanation is that at t he initial stage of the process, when the reaction mediated by active 
chlorine is preponderant, agitation enhances the transpor t of reactants, positively affecting decolorization. 
However, as the reactions proceed, stirring of t he solution can favor the formation of chlorates and 
perchlorates, thus reducing the availability of hydroxyl radicals for color removal (Aquino et al., 2013). 
4. Conclusions 
The results of the present study indicate that t he decolorization of RG19 on BDD electrodes proceeds 
through two distinct reactions, one mediated by active  chlorine and the other by hydroxyl radicals. The 
kinetic model developed provides a simple and effect ive way to quantitatively ev aluate the contribution of 
each process variable to the time intervals required to achieve 50% ( τ50) and 99% ( τ99) decolorization. The 
obtained results also suggest that the decolorization of azo dyes on BDD electrodes can be optimized by 
proper selection of process conditi ons. To this end, a statistical approach, such as the response surface 
methodology coupled with a factorial design including the most significant operating variables, could be 
effectively used.
