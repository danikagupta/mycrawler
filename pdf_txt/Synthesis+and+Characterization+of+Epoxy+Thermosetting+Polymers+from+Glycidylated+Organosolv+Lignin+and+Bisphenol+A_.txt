Abstract.  Diglycidylether of bisphenol A (BPA) and isophorone diamine (IPDA) are 
industrially used for epoxy resin  synthesis.  Herein, glycidylated Organosolv lignin ( GOL) is 
cured with  DGEBA and IPDA  for intensive  studies . Organosolv lignin  (OL)  is therefore first 
glycidylated with epichlor ohydrin to a material with an epoxy content of 3.2 mmol/g and 
analyzed  via FTIR , 1H and 31P NMR. Epoxy resins with up to 42 wt% GOL are c ured in DSC 
crucibles , analyzing  the residual reaction heat. Characterization of d og bone shaped 
specimens is described  with regard to  structural properties from  scanning electron microscopy  
(SEM)  and FT -IR, thermal properties by  differential scanning calorimetry  (DSC)  and 
thermogravimetric analysis  (TGA) , as well as mechanical properties  by dynamic mechanical 
analysis  (DMA)  and stress/strain measurements.  A lignin content between 8 and 33% leads  to 
higher cross -linking density , resulting  in a higher glass transition, lower swelling percentage 
and increased stiffness (Young’s modulus)  if compared to non -GOL resins . 
 
 
  
    
 - 3 - 1 Introduction   
Bisphenol -A (BPA) is one of the most  produced chemicals worldwide and broadly used as 
monomer for polycarbonates, epoxy resins, polyesters or o ther polymers .[1] It finds 
application s in consumer products including  food containers, bottles, tableware and paper for 
food packaging and medical equipment.[2] However, BPA exposure to the environment and to 
humans is followed by health  concerns .[2–5] Although  its activity as  xenoestrogen  is already 
known for decades,[6] the produ ction volume in 2012 was 4.6  million  tons, with a rising 
trend .[7] In addition  to health care issues , BPA is obtained from fossil resources. T he 
decreasing fossil feedstock  is a growing  problem demanding  new synthetic  routes from 
renewable resources . As one of the most abundant biopolymers on earth, lignin is a highly 
available renewable resource.[8] Due to its high aromatic content, it is investigated either for 
the replacement of aromatic monomers, obtained from lign in degradation ( e.g., vanillin, 
eugenol, other 4 -substituted or 2 -methoxy phenols[9–11]), or used as macromolecular structure 
for polymeric materials  (i.e. in blends or composites) . The monomer approach  towards 
renewable based  epoxy resins from lignin -obtained phenols was already intensively 
investigated. Vanillin -based epoxy resins were described in detail by Caillol et al .[12–14] 
Recently, epoxy thermosets from glycidylated iso-eugenol were presented.[15] In contrast, the 
macromolecular approach , i.e. the use of modified lignin as reactive monomer in epoxy 
resins,  is more challenging due to the heterogenic structure of lignin and structural differences 
emerging through pulping procedures (Kraft, Organosolv, sulfite, pyrolysis,  steam 
explosion,…).  
 
The direct use of lignin as macromolecular structure in epoxy resins was limited for a long 
time to the use in blends  and as ring -opening reagent s.[16–22] In some cases, modification of 
lignin becomes  necessary . For instance, hydroxy  groups in lignin were converted to acid ic     
 - 4 - groups via esterification with succinic anhydride, increasing the reactivity towards 
epoxides.[23] In the last years, the interest for using lignin as epoxide compound incr eased and 
various approaches of using  glycidylated lignin in epoxy resins were presented. Malutan et al.  
showed that the glycidylation of Kraft lignin depends on the origin of lignin and on  different 
temperatures and reaction times.[24] For instance, wheat straw lignin lead to higher epoxy 
values than grass straw lignin under the same reaction conditions. Synthesis of cured epoxy 
resins with lignin are described with a) a conventional coating primer,[25] b) the 
diglycidylether of BPA (DGEBA) as additional epoxide compound and different hardene rs 
(triethylenetatraamine,[26] 4,4’-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM)[27,28] or a imidazole -based 
hardener[29]) or c) without a second epoxide compound, using a tung oil derived hardener[30] 
or a conventional novolac.[31] The various publications address differ ent aspects of the 
characteristics of lignin -based resins. Some focus on thermal properties[27,31] and others 
analyze specific application s, such  as epoxy asphalt s[30] or coatings.[25] Recent publications  
examined the DSC curing behavior of lignin -based ep oxy resins, analyzing the activation 
energy.[28,30] 
In this work, the influence of  macromolecular  GOL  content in a conventiona l epoxy resin 
with DGEB A was examined  in detail . Isophoro ne diamine (IPDA) was chosen as cross -linker , 
since  it is a common indust rial amine hardener. A full  analysis of basic properties is  covered 
by analysis of curing behavior via DSC, structural information from IR and SEM, thermal 
properties from DSC and TGA, mechanical properties obtained by strain/stress measurement 
and DMA, as well as swelling in THF.  
2 Experimental Section  
2.1 Materials  
The following chemicals were obtained from c ommercial sources and used without further 
purification:      
 - 5 - Biphenol -A diglycidyl ether ( sigma -aldrich ), dichloromethane  (sigma -aldrich), diphosphorous 
pentoxide (VWR), epichlor ohydrin ( sigma -aldrich ), hydrochloric acid (37%, fisher scientific ) 
isophorone diamine ( TCI), magnesium sulfate  (VWR ), n-hexane (sigma -aldrich) , sodium 
chloride ( fisher scientific ), potassium  hydroxide ( sigma -aldrich ), pyridine ( acros ), tetrabutyl  
ammonium bromide ( Acros ), tetrahydrofuran ( sigma -aldrich ). 
2.2 Reaction procedures  
2.2.1 Organosolv Pulping  
The O rganosolv pulping was performed at the Thünen Institute of Wood Research  (Hamburg, 
Germany). European beech wood ( F. sylvatica L .) chips (10.8 kg) were treated with 
ethanol/water (50  v%) at 170  °C for 90  min with a catalytic amount H2SO 4 (0.5 wt% based on 
dry wood). The solid to liquid ratio was 1:4. The lignin fraction in solution was separated 
from the solid fraction by filtration. Organosolv lignin ( OL) was precipitated in water at a pH 
value of around 2. The suspension was centri fuged and OL separated. OL was dried at 40 °C 
in a vacuum drying oven and isolated as a brown solid (785 g, 7.8 wt %). The total h ydroxy 
content of this unmodified lignin was calculate d to be 4.53  mmol/g  (from 31P NMR analysis).  
2.2.2 Glycidylation procedure  
Organosolv lignin (25.0  g, 15 2 mmol OH)  was suspended in epichlor ohydrin (100 mL, 1.28 
mol) . Under ice cooling, tetrabutylammonium bromide , TBABr,  (9.5 g, 29.6 mmol) was 
slowly added and the mixture stirred for 30 min. Portion -wise, p otassium hydroxide (29.9 g, 
534 mmol) was added over 2.5 hours. After stirring for another 5 hours at room temper ature, 
the mixture was diluted with  dichloromethane (300 m L) and extracted with water (3 ×  200 
mL). The aqueous phase was ext racted with dichloromethane (2 ×  50 mL) and  the combined 
organic layers were washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (100 mL). After 
separation, the organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtrated and concentrated in a     
 - 6 - rotary evaporator to 200  mL. The product was precipitated  in n-hexane, filtrated and dried at 
10-3 mbar over diphosphorous pentoxide.  
1H NMR (3 00 MHz, DMSO -d6, δ): 6.87 – 6.61 (m, Ar H), 4.09 – 3.35 (m , -OCH 3, epoxy -
CH), 2.86 – 2.55 (m , aliphatic H ); IR (ATR): ν = 3450  (br), 2994 (w), 2943 (w), 2873 (w), 
1725 (w), 1597 (m), 1502 (m), 1457 (m), 1413 (m), 1330 (m), 1228 (m), 1125 (s), 1030 (m), 
909 (m), 845 (m), 758 (w)  cm-1. 
2.2.3 Preparation of epoxy resin  
Glycidylated lignin and bisphenol -A diglycidyl ether were mixed in different ratios to a total 
amount of 1. 50 g.  Isophorone diamine was added in the ratio nepoxide  : namine = 2 : 1 , giving a 
molar  ratio of 1 , as one amine can react with two epoxides. The materials were mixed 
homogeneously, poured into dog bone shaped molds and cured in the oven for  1 hour at 70 
°C, then heated to 120 °C for 2 more hours.  
2.3 Analytical procedures  
2.3.1 Epoxy content titration  
An exact amount (mS) of approximately 200 mg glycidylated lignin was solved in 25.0 mL 
pyridine/HCl solution (Stock solution: 500 mL pyridine and 8.30 mL concentrated 
hydrochloric acid (37%))  and refluxed for 20 min at 115 °C. The sample solution was titrated 
with 2  M NaOH solution to neutral pH  with a required volume Vs. A blank was measured 
using unmodified OL resulting in a required volume Vblank. The epoxy content ( nepoxy/g) was 
calculated as followed:  
                             
          (1)     
 - 7 - 2.3.2 1H NMR Spectroscopy  
1H NMR spectra were measured in DMSO -d6 with a Bruker AC 300 using 256 scans and a 
time delay d1 of 10 seconds at 25 °C. The sample concentration was 20 mg/mL. All 1H NMR 
data are reported in ppm relative to the solvent signal for DMSO -d6 at 2.50 ppm.  
2.3.3 31P NMR Spectroscopy  
An exact amount of 28 –32 mg of the lignin sample was diluted in 400 µL CDCl 3/pyridine (1 : 
1.6). 150 µL of a solution of chromium(III) acetylacetonate (3.6 mg/mL) as relaxation agent 
and cyclohexanol (4.0 mg/mL) as internal standard in CDCl 3/pyridine (1 : 1.6) were added 
and the solution was stirred for 5 minutes. 2 -Chloro -4,4,5,5 -tetramethyl -1,2,3 -
dioxaphospholane (70 µL) was added and the solution was transferred into a NMR tube for 
subsequent measurement in a Bruker AscendTM 400 MHz spectrometer with  512 scans, a 
delay time d1 of 5  seconds and a spectral width of 75 ppm (102 – 177 ppm). The chemical 
shifts are reported relative to the reaction product of 2 -chloro -4,4,5,5 -tetramethyl -1,2,3 -
dioxaphospholane with water at 132.2 ppm. Integrals are assigned to the functional groups as 
followed: δ = 150.0  – 145.5 (aliphatic hydroxy  group s), 145.5  – 144.7 (cyclohexanol), 144.7 – 
136.6 (phenolic hydroxy  groups), 136.6  – 133.6 (carboxylic acids) ppm.[32] In the region of 
the phenolic hydroxy  groups, syringyl (144.7  – 141.0 ppm) and guiacyl units (141.0  – 136.6 
ppm) can be distinguished  
2.3.4 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)  
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a DSC Q100 system from TA 
instruments. For reaction heat studies , 6 – 8 mg of the reaction mixture was heated in 
aluminum crucibles from 0 °C to 250 °C with a heating rate of 10 K min-1. 
The cured resin were analyzed  with the following  heating program with two cycles : first 
heating cycle: -50 °C – 200 °C (10 K  min-1); Cooling: 200 – -50 °C ( -20 K  min-1), second 
heating cycle: -50 °C – 250 °C (10 K  min-1). The gl ass transition temperature ( Tg) was defined     
 - 8 - as the midpoint of the change in heat capacity occurring over the transition in the second 
heating cycle.  
2.3.5 FT-IR Spectroscopy  
Infrared spectra  were recorded on a Bruker alpha -p instrument applying ATR technology.  
2.3.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  
SEM was performed on a HITACHI -S570  with an accelerating voltage of 12 kV. The  surface 
was coated with gold by sputtering  for 14 s prior to the measurements  using a  Balzers UNION 
SCD 040.  Digital Image Scanning  System and Processing System (DISS and DIPS) from 
point electronic were used to generate the images.  
2.3.7 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)  
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a TGA -Q500 system from TA 
instruments at a heating rate of 5 K min-1 under synthetic air flow employing a sample mass 
of approximately 15 mg . From the two degradation temperatures of 5% ( Td 5%) and 30% ( Td 
30%) weight loss, the statistic heat -resistant index ( Ts) is calculated as follows :[33] 
                                             (2) 
2.3.8 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)  
A DMA RSA 3 system from TA instruments was used to modulate from 25 °C t o 240 °C at a 
heating rate of 5 K min-1. The measurements were performed in 3 -point bending mode at a 
frequency of 1  Hz, an initial force of 0.5 N and a strain sweep of 0.01%.  The storage modulus 
E’ is def ined as the constant value below and over the glass transition.  The glass transition 
temperature ( Tg) is defined as the onset of the change in the storage modulus.  The cross -
linking density can be calculated from the following equation according to rubber elastic 
theory:[34] 
     
                         (3)     
 - 9 - where E’ is the storage modulus of the cured resin in the rubbery state,   is the front factor 
(approxima tely 1 in Flory theory[35]), R = 8.314 J mol-1 K-1 the gas constant and    is the 
maximum of tan delta (tan delta = E’’/E’ , with E’’ defined as loss modulus ). 
2.3.9 Stress/strain  measurement  
Stress/strain measurements were performed on a MTS Elite 25 system using a elongation at 
break method with dog bone shaped specimen s (width = 2 mm; thickness = 2 mm and length 
of fixed section = 17.5 mm ) using a 500 N load cell and a crosshead speed of 1 mm min-1. 
Young’s modulus (E) was determined fro m the linear part of  the stress/ strain curves  for all 
samples.  
2.3.10  Swelling properties  
Swelling properties of weighted bar samples ( m0) of the cured resins were analyzed.  After 
immersion in THF f or 24 hours, the swollen samples  were dried between paper and weighted 
again ( mSW). The samples were dried at 60 °C for 24 hours and weighted ( mD) to obtain the 
swelling percentage  
                   
             (4) 
and the soluble part of the networks  
                      
              (5) 
 
3 Results and Discussion  
3.1 Characterization of the glycidylated  Organ osolv lignin  
OL was isolated at Thünen Institute of Wood Research via an ethanol —water pulping and 
used without further fractioning (for details, see experimental part) . A full characterization of 
this batch OL can  be found in the literature.[36] Glycidylation  of OL with epichlor ohydrin in 
the presence of NaOH and TBAB r was performed without external heating. The exothermic     
 - 10 - reaction led to heat evolution , so that ice cooling was necessary  in the first hours  to avoid 
temperatures above 50 °C. In literature, the increase of reaction temperature s from 50 to 70 or 
90 °C led to lower epoxy contents.[24,37] However, no reaction conditions at room temperature 
are described. In the present work,  a lignin epoxy mater ial with an epoxy content of 3.2 
mmol/g was obtained.  The value is in the range of similarly functionalized steam exploded 
lignin[29,31] or O rganosolv lignin[27] and higher than for glycidylated  Kraft or acetic acid 
lignin.[24,26,37] The comparison reveal s that Organosolv and steam exploded lignin resu lt in 
higher epoxy contents . A reason for this behavior may be the better solubility and lower molar 
mass of the se lignins. Moreover, a higher aromatic hydroxyl group content in these lignins  is 
present due to the pulping conditions.  In addition  to the titration result , 31P NMR was 
performed. T he glycidylated compound showed a  decrease of t he aromatic hy droxy groups 
from  1.83 mmol/g to 0 mmol/g, indicating that all phenolic  groups reacted  (Table 1). The 
value for the aliphatic hydroxy  group s decreased from 2.70 to 1.92 mmol/g leading to an  
overall functionalization of at least 2.6 mmol/g. The value is lowe r than the one obtained from 
titration , which may indicate  that epoxy rings were partially opened. A ring opening  with 
water as nucleophile  would resu lt in two new aliphatic hydroxy groups, explaining a small 
increase of aliphatic hydroxy groups and the change in signal shape of the aliphatic region 
(for 31P spectra, see SI).

 - 11 - FT-IR analysis of glycidylated lignin revealed a significant decrease of hydroxy group 
stretching vibrations at ~3450 cm-1 (Figure 1), indicating the ir functionalization . In addi tion, a 
new signal  appeared  at 909 cm-1, which is typical for the asymmetric stretching vibration band 
of C-O-C in epoxy functions .[38] Vibration s of ether linkages, such as the newly for med C -O-
glycidyl, show typical  bands in the region between 1000 and 1200  cm-1. Here, a  significant 
increase was  observed. The signals o f the functional groups that did  not take place in the 
modification procedure, such as C -H bonds (2600 – 3000 cm-1) and aromatic C=C  bonds 
(1502 and 1597 cm-1), did not change . The results are in agreement with previous reported 
FT-IR spectra for glycidyla ted lignin s.[24,26,29 –31,37] 
 
Figure 1. FT-IR spectra  (ATR)  of modified, glycidylated lignin (top) and unmodified lignin 
(bottom).  
 
Analyzing  the degradation temperature for 5% weight loss ( Td 5%), the thermal stability 
revealed an increase  accompanied with  glycidylation , from 233 to 269 °C (for TGA traces, 
see SI). The mai n difference occurred  during the first 30% weight loss. At the Td 30% value, the 
degradation traces assimilate d. Both traces show ed two main degradation steps. This first 
degradation process between 280 and 350 °C can be assigned to inter -unit ether bond 
cleavage i n lignin. This results in  evaporation of volatile aromatic compounds.[39,40] A second  
step occurs between 500 and 600 °C. At this temperature , aromatic  rings are expected  to 
decompose.[41] This two-step degradation is characteristic  for cross -linked materials with 
    
 - 12 - aromatic and ether functional groups as in lignin.  This first degradation step is more relevant 
for glycidylated lignin compared to unmodified lignin  as there are  addition al ether functions 
in the product. Increased degradation temperatures for glycidylated  lignin compared to 
unmodified lignin are described in  literature for Kraft lignin[37] as well as for Organosolv 
lignin.[42] 
3.2 Curing behavior of lignin reinforced epoxy resin  
The curing behavior of lignin reinforced epoxy resins was investigated  via DSC studies. GOL  
and DGEBA were mixed with different lignin contents (0 to 50 wt% of the epoxy part , which 
is 0 to 42 wt% of the resin ) and with a stoichiometric amount  of IPDA . IPDA contains two 
amines – an aliphatic amine and a cycloaliphatic amine. Each amine can react  with two  
epoxides .[43] Thus, t he molar ratio r is calculated as follow ed: 
                                       
                      (6) 
assuming that the functionality of IPDA  (famine) is equal to 4 and the functionality of DGEBA  
(fDGEBA ) is equal to 2 and t he molar quantities of amine, DGEBA and GOL  are assigned to 
namine, nepoxy(DGEBA) and nepoxy(GOL ), respectively. Hence, a stoichiometric amount is 
defined by a ratio r = 1 and usuall y leads to the highest thermomechanical properties.[44] 
The recorded DSC trace s for  different  lignin  contents in the final resin  are shown in Figure 
2a. The heating  revealed an exothermic peak with a starting point  at 50 °C, a maximum 
around  110 °C and end point at 220  °C. The maximum shifts slightly to lower temperature , 
from 114 °C to 100  °C, with increased lignin content of 0 wt% to 42 wt%, respectively. A 
shoulder,  observed at 150 °C, decrea ses in intensity with increasing  lignin content.  The two 
peaks result from the difference in reactivity of the aliphatic  and cyclo -aliphatic  amino gr oups 
in IPDA. Cyclo -aliphatic amines are less reactive than aliphatic amines.[43] A reason for the 
decrease of the shoulder and the shift of the maximum with increased lignin content may be 
assigned to the remaining free hydroxy groups in lignin, that react with epoxides, hindering     
 - 13 - amines to react. Usually, the reaction of hydroxy group s with epoxides is only relevant if 
excess of epoxides are used.[43] Yet, the sterically hindered structure of lignin may favor this 
reaction.  
 
The residual  reaction heat    of the curing  process  is plotted against the lignin content in the 
final resin ( Figure 2b).    in J/g decreases with increasing lignin content from 385 J/g for 
0 wt% to 291  J/g for 42 wt% (Figure 2b, black ). The    value for the  lignin -free DGEBA -
IPDA resin is in the order of literature values.[44][45] To the best of our knowledge, no residual 
heat reaction was analyzed for lignin -based epoxy resins in literature  before . Simultaneously  
with the reaction heat decrease , the epoxy  group content in the uncured mixture  decreases 
from  5.88 to 4.54  mmol/g . Considering  this decrease, the reactio n heat varies between 56 and 
66 J/mmol  epoxide  without sig nificant increase or decrease tendency  (Figure 2b, grey) , 
indicating that the reactivity of the epoxides  in glycidylated lignin and DGEBA is similar.

content in wt%)  at a heating rate of 10 K min-1; b) Reaction heat in J/g (left axis, black ) and in 
J/mmol epoxy (right axis, grey).  
 
3.3 Structure of cured resins  
The final resins were cured in an oven at 70 °C for 1 hour and 120 °C for 2 hours in dog bone 
shape silicon mold s to obtain specimen s for direct structural and thermomechanical analyses.  
    
 - 14 - Comparison  of the IR region between 500 and 1800 cm-1 for cure d epoxy resins with uncured 
GOL  shows the decrease of the epoxy C -O deformation vibration band  for resins with  lignin 
content s between 0 and 33 wt .% (Figure 3). Only for the resin with 42 wt .% GOL, the signal 
at 909 cm-1 is still present, indicating an inefficient curing process.  Other changes in signal in 
Figure 3 can be explained as followed from  the lowest wavenumber going to the highest. The 
broad signal at < 600 cm-1 results from skeletal C -C-C and H -C-C deformation vibrations  
mainly  found in BPA a nd IPDA. The increased signal at 830 cm-1 should mainly result  from 
the C -H deformation vibration  in the 1 -4 substituted BPA.[46] C-N stretching vibrations of 
tertiary amines contained in the cured resins show a typical ly band s at 1070 cm-1. The signal 
is overlaying with the symmetric C -O-C stretching vibration of aromatic ether and the C -H 
deformation vibration of 1 -4 substituted BPA. Likewise, t he new signal at 1180 cm-1 can be 
assigned to the  deformation vibration of benzylic C -H in BPA . Aromatic  ether i n BPA show s 
a broad band for the asymmetric C -O-C stretching vibration at 1233 cm-1. Due to the different 
origin of the C=C stretching vibrations in the aromatic rings of BPA compared to GOL, two 
signals can be found, at 1581 and 1608 cm-1. All in all, the  IR analysis showed the expected 
changes and proved the reaction of the epoxide s. Only in the case of the highest applied lignin 
content, no efficient reaction was observed. The reason for inefficient reaction may be the 
poor miscibility of glycidylated li gnin, DGEBA and IPDA due to the high solid -to-liquid 
ratio. Because of miscibility issues , no higher lignin contents were evaluated.

SEM images with a magnitude of 5000 of the different resins are shown in Figure 4a-f. Cured 
resins were analyzed at a breaking edge. In all resins , the break caused the visible lamellar 
structure. Within the structure , homogeneity differences can be observed. The addition of 
lignin caused the formation of small dots, increasing in number with increasing GOL content.  
These dots are not observed in lignin -free epoxy resin ( Figure 4a). With 8, 20 and 28 wt .% 
GOL in the resin, the structure is mostly homogeneous  (Figure 4b-d). In the resins with the 
highest lignin amounts of 33 and 42 wt .% (Figure 4e and f ), the agglomerations increased 
compared to lower lignin contents, indicating the partial incompatibility with the epoxy resin. 
This incompatibility ca n be explained by the inhomogeneous structure of lignin itself.  
Compared to literature  results of SEM images for lignin -based epoxy resin , the herein 
discussed GOL still shows a better resin compatibility at higher lignin content : acetic acid 
lignin -based epoxy resin curing with DGEBA and triethylenetetramine  led to higher 
agglomeration and even porosity if 50% of DGEBA were replaced.[26]

 - 17 - 3.4 Thermomechanical  properties of epoxy resins from DGEBA and glycid ylated 
lignin  
The influence of the lignin content on thermomechanical properties was studied by TGA, 
DSC, DMA and stress/strain measurements. The degradation temperature for 5% weight loss 
(Td 5%), measured via TGA, decreases from 334 °C to 284 °C, with in creasing lignin content 
(Figure 5a). Regarding the weight loss trace ( Figure 5b), the degradation temperature for 
30% weight loss ( Td 30 %) is in a narrower region between 338 and 350 °C. Likewise, the 
lignin -free composite is the most stable resin. T he heat resistant index  Ts, calculated from 
Equation  (2), varies between  168 and 156 °C and thus, also decreases with increasing lignin 
content. Although this initial degradation starts at higher temperatures for lignin -free resin, 
the second degradation step starts later for lignin -containing resins. Earli er initial degradation 
for lignin -containing resins coincides with observations for other lignin -DGEBA[26] and lignin 
epoxy resins without second epoxy compound.[29,31] The first degradation, as discussed for the 
unmodified and glycidylated lignin, occurs mainly between 280 and 350 °C and is most 
significant for all samples. A second degradation step from further cracking processes occurs 
between 500 and 600 °C. Since this behavior hardly changes with the addition of lignin, the 
similar characteristics of l inkages in lignin -based and lignin -free epoxy material is exhibited.

lignin content  obtained from TGA ; b) Comparison of the  weights loss during TGA  for the 
different cured resins  at a heating rate of 5 K  min-1. 
 
The glass transition temperature ( Tg) was evaluated from DSC and DMA measurements  
(Figure 6). Tg increases from 150 °C to 168 °C (DSC), with increasing  lignin content from 0 
to 33 wt%. DMA results show the same tendency , with Tg values ranging from 123 to 138 °C. 
Going to 42 wt% lignin, Tg drops  to 132 °C (for DMA; no Tg observed in DSC).  An increased 
Tg may indicate a higher cross -linking density in the resin.[43] Glycidylated lignin contains free 
hydroxy groups that could react with epoxides, leading to higher cross -linking. On the other 
hand, the inhom ogeneous structure of lignin may lead to a more rigid structure, also leading to 
a higher Tg.

Figure 6. Glass transition temperature of the cured resins with different lignin content 
obtained from DSC (grey) and DMA (black) . 
 
Mechanical properties of the resins from stress/strain and DMA measurements are shown in 
Table 2. Young’s modulus E varied between 1.82 and 1.88 GPa. This is within expectations 
for DGEBA -based epoxy resins. In literature, values around 3 GPa are reported.[47,48] 10% 
replacement of DGEBA by  lignin led to a drop of E from 1.88 to 1.82 GPa. A low lignin 
amount seems to add flexibility to the resin, which may be explained by lower epoxy density. 
Going to a higher lignin content (50 wt% of DGEBA were replaced by GOL), the product 
became more rigid ( E increases), leading to a brittle material that could not be fixed to the 
apparatus without breaking immediate ly. The increase of E, accompanied by higher stiffness, 
results from the inhomogeneous structure of lignin. This observation coincides with the 
increasing glass transition with increasing lignin content. The storage modulus E’ in the 
glassy state obtained from DMA was in a similar region and showed the same tendency as E. 
Likewise, the observed decrease in the elongation at break  for higher GOL content  indicates a 
higher stiffness  (Table 2, column 3) . The c ross-linking density, calculated from Equation (3) 
from the  storage modulus E’ in the rubbery phase and   , showed an increase with growing 
lignin content, as already estimated from the glass transition. BPA -IPDA resins exhibited a 
cross -linking density   of 9.9 103 mol m-3 and the resins with 28 and 33 wt% lignin showed 
densities of 23 and 22  103 mol m-3, respectively. Only for the resin with the highest lignin 
    
 - 20 - content of 42 wt%, a decrease was observed. The already discussed  for other analytics, the 
GOL is poorly miscible with  DGEBA and IPDA if the lignin -content is to high und thus, no 
satisfying results ca n be obtained.  The optimum can be found for a resin with 33 wt% of 
GOL.

3.5 Swelling properties  
The swelling of the cured resins was performed in THF as described in section 2.3.10  in the 
expe rimental part. Swelling and soluble part were calculated from Equation (4) and (5),  
respectively, and summarized for all lignin contents ( Table 3). A lower percentage of 
swelling usually indicates a higher cross -linking density, as distances within the network are 
smaller and thus, solvent absorption is lower as well. Swelling decrease d from 7 to 1%, in 
tandem with increased  lignin content from 0 to 20 wt%. This implies a higher cross -linking 
with a lignin content of 20 wt%. Higher  lignin contents r esulted in increased swelling up to  
10% for 42 wt% GOL . The soluble part remained constan tly low and then increased with 
increased lignin content from 0% soluble part for 0, 8 or 20 wt% lignin content to 6% soluble 
part for 42 wt% lignin content. As estimated from Tg and calculated from DMA, the swelling     
 - 21 - test revealed the same tendency. The ad dition of lignin initially stabilized the epoxy resin 
product due to a higher cross -linking, but led to poor network formation with lignin content of 
42 wt%.

4 Conclusion  
Epoxy resins were synthesized from glycidylated organosolv lignin and D GEBA in different 
weight ratios and IPDA as commo n industrial hardener . Under the chosen conditions, lignin 
could not completely replace BPA. However, in the applied weight ratios, lignin revealed 
reinforcing properties  with weight percentages up to 33% in the final product . DSC  curing 
verified the replacement suitability , indicating a similar reactivity for lignin - and BPA -based 
epoxides.  The completed reaction in the final resins was verified by the disappearance of the 
epoxy stretching vibration band in IR spectroscopy. In addition, thermal  and mechanic al 
analysis revealed  that lignin -based resins have a higher cross -linking density compared to 
pure DGE BA-IPDA resin , if 10 to 40 wt .% of DGEBA was replaced. Although,  thermal 
stability decreases with increasing lignin content, degradation temperatures are  still in a n 
applicable region for epoxy resins. Due to inhomogeneity in lignin itself, inhomogeneity in 
the produced resins was observed if the renewable content is increased but  can still be 
considered low.  All in all, it could be shown that GOL is suitable for partial replacement of 
DGEBA in an industria l relevant epoxy resin.
