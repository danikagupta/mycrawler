Abstract  
Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and aqueous  bromine (consisting mostly of  hypobromous acid, HOBr) are 
crucial compounds of the marine sulfur (S) and bromine (Br) cycle, respectively, and both biogenically 
produced in marine waters. Furthermore, both DMS and HOBr influence atmospheric chemistry and 
climate: volatile DMS is emitted from the ocean into the atmosphere, where it triggers the formation 
of ae rosols and clouds, whereas HOBr reacts with dissolved organic matter (DOM) (particularly with 
phenolic moieties) to the volatile trihalomethane (THM) compound bromoform (CHBr 3). CHBr 3 is 
photolyzed to Br atoms  (Br●) in the atmosphere and thereby contributes to atmospheric ozone (O 3) 
destruction. However, there is a major difference between DMS and HOBr: DMS is a nucleophilic 
compound with a high electron density on the reduced S -atom (S [-II]), while Br in HOBr (Br [+I]) is 
electrophilic. Therefore, we hypothesized that the reaction between DMS and HOBr is occurring 
readily  and may even have implications for marine DMS and HOBr and subsequently CHBr 3 
concentrations. However, so far the kinetic s of the DMS -HOBr reaction was not investigated , where 
we determined 2nd order rate constants and performed kinetic modeling  to (i) determine the kinetic s 
of the  reaction s of HOBr with DMS and its oxidation products  (ii) establish the potential importance of 
the HOBr -DMS  reaction as  a sink for marine DMS and (iii) study the competition of the reactions 
between HOBr and DMS or DOM with respect to CHBr 3 formation. Volatile compounds (i.e. DMS, CHBr 3 
and other THM -species) were quantified via solid -phase -microextraction coupled with gas  
chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME -GC/MS), whereas non -volatile DMS oxidation products 
were quantified by a  novel method based on high  performance  liquid  chromatography  in combination 
with inductively  coupled  plasma  tandem  mass  spectrometry ( HPLC -ICP-MS/MS) . 
With  competition kinetics, a second -order rate constant of 1.6   109 M-1 s-1 for the DMS -HOBr reaction. 
The product of this reaction is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which reacted much slower with HOBr with 
a second -order rate constant of 0.4 M-1 s-1. In combination with a model -based estimation of marine 
HOBr concentrations, it  is likely that HOBr represents a new, so far unexplored sink for marine DMS, 
as the derived first -order rate constant for DMS degradation (range: 1   10-7 – 3  10-5 s-1) is of the 
same order of magnitude as for major reported DMS sinks (i.e. photochemical oxidation, bacterial 
cons umption, sea -air gas exchange). The possible relevance of HOBr as a sink for marine DMS was    
iii 
 further tested in batch and diffusion -reactor exp eriments, where the competition kinetics of the DMS -
HOBr and DOM -HOBr reactions (batch and diffusion -reactor experiments) and DMS and HOBr fluxes 
(diffusion -reactor experiment) were studied under environmentally -relevant conditions. In these 
experiments, t he aquatic natural organic matter (NOM) standards “Pony  Lake  Fulvic  Acid” (PLFA) and 
“Upper Mississippi  River  Natural  Organic  Matter” (UMRNOM) served as surrogates for marine DOM. 
In kinetic batch experiments, DMS was found to be completely oxidized by HOB r to dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO) for marine DMS:DOM (and DMS:phenolic moiety) concentration ratios. Also in diffusion -
reactor experiments, in which DMS - and HOBr - flux to DOM -concentration ratios typical for algal 
blooms were studied, DMS was completely cons umed b y HOBr. To verify the transferability of these 
experimental findings to the natural marine environment and to test tipping points for DMS and HOBr 
fluxes to become important for HOBr, CHBr 3 and DMS concentrations, we created a diffusion -reaction 
mode l containing ranges of DMS and HOBr fluxes, which are typical for algal blooms and the most 
relevant reactions for DMS and HOBr (i.e. sinks for marine DMS and HOBr). In comparison to a DMS 
steady -state concentration for a HOBr flux of zero, this model pred icts a reduction of DMS steady -state 
concentrations of 1 - 93 % when fluxes of DMS and HOBr are changed from 0 to 10-13 M s-1 – 10-9 M s-1 
for equal HOBr and DMS fluxes. For HOBr fluxes higher than 10-11 M s-1, HOBr is even the dominant 
sink for marine DMS, with a higher DMS degradation than the combined DMS degradation via 
photochemical oxidation, biological consumption and sea -air gas exchange.  
The role of DMS to suppress the formation of CHBr 3 was also investigated . In kinetic batch experiments, 
a red uction of CHBr 3 formation of 95% was observed when DMS was used at equal concentrations to 
HOBr, which implies that DMS quenched most of HOBr and thereby reduced the availability of HOBr 
to react with DOM (or phenolic moiet ies) to CHBr 3. The above introduc ed diffusion -reaction model 
shows that a reduction of CHBr 3 steady -state concentrations of 4 - 100% is obtained when fluxes of 
DMS and HOBr are changed from 0 to 10-13 M s-1 – 10-9 M s-1 (for equal HOBr and DMS fluxes)  in 
comparison to a CHBr 3 steady -state concentration for a DMS flux of zero.  
The experimental and model -based findings thus suggest that depending on the fluxes, the reaction 
between DMS and HOBr might indeed influence both DMS and CHBr 3 concentrations in marine waters 
and therefore sea -air gas fluxes and atmospheric concentrations of these compounds and associated 
chemical processes in the atmosphere.  Therefore, the reaction between DMS and HOBr should be 
included in marine biogeochemical models, particularly for circumstances which are cha racterized by 
high DMS and HOBr production, i.e., algal blooms.  
Since  HOBr can act as a sink for marine DMS, the question arises whether HOBr might also represent 
a major sink for the selenium (Se) analog dimethyl selenide (DMSe), particularly as organic S e species    
iv 
 are often reported to be more reactive compared to their S -analogs. In analogy to marine DMS, marine 
DMSe is the main Se  species emitted from the ocean into the atmosphere and atmospheric transport 
from the ocean to the land surface has been sugg ested as a source of Se to terrestrial ecosystems and 
food chains.  
Selenium has similar chemical characteristics as sulfur (both elements are chalcogens, i.e. they belong 
to the 6th main group in the periodic table) as well as one big difference: its envi ronmental 
concentrations and natural fluxes are orders of magnitude lower compared to sulfur. For example, 
mean S seawater concentrations are 884 mg L-1 while mean Se seawater concentrations account for  
Only 0.08 µg L-1 (Se/S seawater concentration  ratio  ≈ 1×10-7). Interestingly, intracellular Se/S 
concentration ratios in marine algae ( ≈10-3 - 10-4) are higher compared to the Se/S ratios in seawater, 
which represents an enrichment of Se over S and points to the beneficial properties of Se for living 
organi sms. The Se/S ratios in marine biota are reflected by the natural marine Se and S emissions 
(≈6.5×109 g yr-1 Se vs ≈35 ×1012 g yr-1 S; Se/S marine biogenic emissions ≈ 2 ×10-4). 
The lower marine Se - than S -emissions are also the reason that in contrast to DM S, DMSe has no 
expected effects on climate. However, DMSe still plays an important role for the global distribution of 
Se which is coupled to Se availability in soils, Se concentrations in food crops and diet.  
Consequently, high significance is attributed  to the processes controlling marine DMSe concentrations 
and DMSe sea -to-air fluxes. Therefore, the kinetic s of the reactions of HOBr with DMSe and potential 
implications for marine DMSe concentr ations  were studied . It was observed  that DMSe is oxidized to 
dimethyl selenoxide (DMSeO) with a second -order rate constant  of 8.3   107 M-1 s-1, which is ca. a 
factor 20 lower compared to the rate constant for the DMS -HOBr reaction. Contrary to DMS, DMSe 
showed an increased reactivity towards HOBr in chl oride - and bromide -containing artificial seawater 
medium ( k’’ = 5.4   108 M-1 s-1), which is likely attributed to other  bromine  species  (i.e. Br2) species. 
However, the lower reactivity of HOBr  with DMSe than with DMS  in seawater suggests that the 
reaction  between HOBr and DMSe is not a key sink for marine DMSe . This is further supported by  the 
calculated first -order degradation rate s of DMSe via reaction with HOBr  (≈ 2.1  10-6 s-1 - 1.4  10-5 s-1) 
which are is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower compared to the reported photochemical degradation of 
DMSe. But it should be mentioned that the information base for marine DMSe sinks, including 
degradation processes , is scarce.  
The kinetics of the rea ctions of HOBr with other organic  selenium compounds (i.e. dimet hyl diselenide, 
DMDSe, diphenyl selenide, DPSe; diphenyl diselenide, DPDSe; selenomethionine, SeMet; 
selenocystine, SeCys 2) were also determined . DMDSe is another volatile organic Se -species that has 
been found in marine waters but at lower concentrations than  DMSe.  SeMet  and SeCys 2 are common    
v 
 Se-amino acids with a function in oxidative stress prevention and may also occur extracellularly in 
marine waters after cell lysis. These compounds were acetylated to N-acetylated -SeMet and N-
acetylated -SeCys 2 in ord er to inactivate the amino -group  for the kinetic studies .  DPSe and DPDSe  were 
studied  as these are the aryl -analogs of DMSe and DMDSe and provide more general information on 
the reactivity of organic Se compounds . DPSe and DPDSe have an industrial use and  are not known to 
be produced naturally. The kinetic investigations of this set of organic Se  compounds enabled to study 
the effect of different substituents (i.e. alkyl - and phenyl -substituents) and oxidation states of the Se-
atom (i.e. monoselenides: Se[ -II], diselenides: Se[ -I]) on the reaction kinetics with HOBr. Volatile Se  
species (i.e. DMSe, DMDSe) were quantified via SPME -GC/MS, whereas non -volatile Se  species (i.e. 
DPSe, DPDSe, N-acetylated -SeMet, N-acetylated -SeCys 2) were quantified by high  performance  liquid -
chromatography  ultraviolet  detection ( HPLC/UV). Our results show that all investigated Se -organic 
compounds react fast with HOBr, with second -order rate constants between 9.4   106 and 3.2   108 
M-1 s-1. The alkylated Se  species DMSe and  DMDSe react faster with HOBr compared to the aryl -analog 
compounds DPSe and DPDSe (i.e. kDMSe = 8.3  107 M-1 s-1; kDPSe = 4.0  107 M-1 s-1; kDMDSe  = 5.0  107 M-
1 s-1; kDPDSe  = 9.4   106 M-1 s-1). The monoselenium compounds DMSe, DPSe and N-acetylated -SeMet 
all react faster than the analog diselenides DMDSe, DPDSe and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 (i.e. kDMSe = 8.3 × 
107 M-1 s-1; kDMDSe  = 5.0  107 M-1 s-1; kDPSe = 4.0  107 M-1 s-1; kDPDSe  = 9.4  106 M-1 s-1; kN-acetylated -SeMet = 
3.2  108 M-1 s-1; kN-acetylated SeCys2  = 4.4  107 M-1 s-1). For diselenides, a consumption of 3 moles HOBr per 
reacted mole diselenide was observed, which points to a faster secondary and tertiary oxidation step 
than the initial reaction.  
Particularly the high reactivity  of N-acetylated -SeMet with HOBr ( k’’ = 3.2  108 M-1 s-1) is notable as (i) 
this reaction is two orders of magnitude faster than the reaction of the S -analog methionine with HOBr , 
(ii) SeMet is one of the major Se -amino acid in living organisms and (iii) SeMet is a well -known 
scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this context, SeMet might be a key compound in 
neutralizing HOBr and preventing the oxidative stress originatin g from HOBr.  
Se oxidation products were determined in separate oxidation experiments using different molar 
HOBr:Se -compound ratios (i.e. HOBr:Se -compound = 0:1, 1:1, 3:1, 10:1). Se oxi dation products were 
identified by high  resolution  mass  spectrometry (HR -MS) and liquid -chromatography coupled to 
inductively  coupled  plasma  tandem  mass  spectrometry (LC -ICP-MS/MS). DMSe oxidation by HOBr 
resulted in dimethyl selenoxide (DMSeO) as the sole product. DMSeO was not further oxidized to 
selenones at HOBr excess con centrations, meaning that DMSeO was the final product. Also the other 
monoselenides (i.e. DPSe and N-acetylated -SeMet) were oxidized to the corresponding selenoxide. For 
DMDSe oxidation, methane seleninic acid was observed as the major product, with the highest yield 
for a molar HOBr:DMDSe = ratio of  3. For  a higher HOBr:DMDSe ratio of 10,  methane seleninic acid was    
vi 
 further oxidized to a product that could not be identified (it is neither selenite  nor selenate).  Similarly, 
the other investigated diselenide s (i.e. DPDSe and N-acetylated -SeCys 2) were oxidized to the 
corresponding seleninic acids. The identified products in our study agree with the findings of previous 
studies investigating the oxidation of monoselenides and diselenides.

Zusammenfassung  
Dimethylsulfid (DMS) und wässriges  Brom (vorwiegend bestehend aus unter bromige r Säure, HOBr) 
sind bedeutende Verbindungen des marinen Schwefel (S)- und Brom (Br) - Kreislaufs und werden beide 
biologisch produziert. Ausserdem beeinflussen sowohl DMS wie auch HOBr die Atmosphärenchemie 
und das Klimasystem: Flüchtiges  DMS wird vom Ozean in die Atmosphäre emittiert, wo es die Bildung 
von Aerosolen und  Wolken begünstigt, während HOBr mit gelöstem organischem Kohlenstoff 
(dissolved organic matter, DOM) – insbesondere mit phenolischen Verbindungen - zur volatilen 
Trihalomethan (THM) -Verbindung Bromoform (CHBr 3) reagiert. Bromoform wird in der Atmosphäre 
photolytisch zu Br -Atome (Br -Radikale) photolytisch abgebaut und trägt auf diese Weise zur 
atmosphärischen Ozon (O 3) Zerstörung bei. Jedoch gibt es einen bedeutenden Unterschied zwischen 
DMS und HOBr: DMS ist eine nukleophile Verbindung mit einer hohen Elek tronendichte am 
reduzierten Schwefelatom (S [-II]), während das Brom in HOBr als Br[+I] vorliegt  und daher einen 
elektrophilen Charakter hat. Deshalb kann angenommen werden , dass die Reaktion zwischen DMS und 
HOBr effizient  ist und einen Einfluss auf die ma rine DMS - und HOBr -Konzentration und damit 
verbunden auf die Bromoform -Konzentration  haben kann. Jedoch wurden bisher keine Studien zur 
DMS -HOBr Kinetik gemacht, weshalb Geschwindigkeitskonstanten 2. Ordnung bestimmt und 
kinetische Modellierung durchgefüh rt wurden  mit dem Ziel (i) die Kinetik der Reaktionen von HOBr mit 
DMS  und seinen Oxidationsprodukten  zu bestimmen, (ii) die Bedeutung dieser Reaktion als mögliche 
Senke für marines DMS zu ermitteln und (iii) die Kompetition der DMS -HOBr Reaktion für die R eaktion 
zwischen HOBr und DOM und der en Einfluss auf die Bromoform -Bildung zu studieren. Volatile 
Verbindungen (DMS, CHBr 3 und andere THM -Spezies) wurden durch Festphasenmikroextraktion 
gekoppelt mit Gaschromatographie/Massenspektrometrie (SPME -GC/MS) quan tifiziert, während 
nicht -volatile DMS Oxidationsprodukte durch eine neu entwickelte 
Hochleistungs flüssigchromatographie in Kombination mit induktiv  gekoppeltem  Plasma  Tandem  
Massenspektrometrie (HPLC -ICP-MS/MS) gemessen wurden.  
In kinetischen Batchexperime nten unter Anwendung der Kompetitionskinetik wurde  eine 
Geschwindigkeitskonstante 2. Ordnung von 1.6   109 M-1 s-1 für die DMS -HOBr Reaktion  ermittelt . Für 
das gebildete Oxidationsprodukt ( Dimethylsulfoxid, DMSO) wurde eine 9 -10 Grössenordnungen    
viii 
 geringere Reaktivität mit HOBr festgestellt  (0.4 M-1 s-1). In Kombination mit modellbasierten 
Schätzungen der marinen HOBr -Konzentration wird vermute t, dass HOBr eine neue, bisher 
unentdeckte Senke für marines DMS darstellt. Die abgeleitete Geschwindigkeitskonstante  1. Ordnung 
für den HOBr -induzierten DMS -Abbau ist im Bereich  von 1   10-7 - 3  10-5 s-1, also ähnlich wie die  
bisher bekannten Hauptsenken von DMS (photochemische Oxidation, biologischer Abbau oder 
Gasaustasch). Die mögliche Relevanz von HOBr als Senke für marines DMS wurde desweiteren in 
kinetischen Batch - und Diffusionsreaktor -Experimenten untersucht. In diesen  Experimenten wurde 
sowohl die Kompetitionskinetik der DMS -HOBr und DOM -HOBr Reaktion (Batch und Diffusionsreaktor -
Experimente) als auch die biologischen Diffusionsflüsse von DMS und HOBr (Diffusionsreaktor -
Experimente) unter umweltrelevanten Bedingungen s tudiert. Zwei verschiedene Referenzstandards 
für natürlichen organischen Kohlenstoff (natural organic matter, NOM) wurden verwendet um das 
marine DOM zu imitieren, es sind dies “Pony  Lake  Fulvic  Acid” (PLFA) und “ Upper -Mississippi  River  
Natural  Organic -Matter” (UMRNOM). In unseren kinetischen Batch -Experimenten zeigte sich, dass 
DMS selbst bei marinen DMS:DOM (und DMS:phenolisch funktionellen Gruppen) 
Konzentrationsverhältnissen vollständig zu Dimethylsulfoxid (DMSO) oxidiert wurde. Auch in den 
Diffusionsre aktor -Experimenten, wo die verwendeten DMS - und HOBr -Fluss zu DOM -Konzentrations -
Verhältnissen denjenigen Verhältnissen in Algenblüten entspricht, wurde eine komplette Oxidation 
von DMS beobachtet. Um die Übertragbarkeit der experimentellen Ergebnisse auf die natürliche 
marine Umwelt zu überprüfen und um kritische DMS und HOBr Flüsse für HOBr -, CHBr 3- und DMS -
Konzentrationen zu eruieren, wurde  ein Diffusions -Reaktions -Modell  erstellt , welches typische 
Bereiche von biologischen DMS - und HOBr -Produktionsflüss en im Meerwasser, sowie die wichtigsten 
relevanten Reaktionen für marines DMS und HOBr (Senken für marines DMS und HOBr) beinhaltet. 
Dieses Modell prognostiziert einen Rückgang der DMS -Konzentration von 1 -93% wenn die HOBr -und 
DMS -Flüsse von 0 auf 10-13– 10-9 M s-1 erhöht werden (DMS -Fluss entspricht HOBr -Fluss), im Vergleich 
zur jeweiligen DMS -Gleichgewichtskonzentration für einen HOBr -Fluss von 0. HOBr wird sogar zur 
dominanten Senke für marines DMS für einen Fluss grösser als 10-11 M s-1 (mit einer gröss eren 
Bedeutung als der kombinierte DMS -Abbau durch photochemische Oxidation, biologischem Abbau  
und Gasaustausch).  
Es wrude auch  untersucht ob DMS die Bildung von Bromoform unterdrückt. In kinetischen Batch -
Experimenten beobachteten wir , dass die Bromofor m-Bildung um 95% unterdrückt wird wenn DMS zu 
gleich grossen Konzentrationen wie HOBr verwendet wird. Dies impliziert , dass DMS mit einem grossen 
Anteil von HOBr reagiert und somit die Verfügbarkeit von HOBr für die Reaktion mit DOM (z.B. 
Reaktion mit phen olischen Gruppen) reduziert, was eine geringere Bromoform bildung zur Folge hat. 
Das oben vorgestelltes Diffusions -Reaktions modell zeigt, dass sich die Bromoform konzentration um 4 -   
ix 
 100% verringert, falls die DMS und HOBr Flüsse von 0 auf 10-13 M s-1 – 10-9 M s-1 erhöht werden (HOBr -
Fluss entspricht DMS -Fluss), im Vergleich zur jeweiligen Bromoformkonzentration bei einem DMS -
Fluss von 0.  
Die experimentellen und modellbasierten Ergebnisse lassen somit  vermuten, dass die DMS -HOBr 
Reaktion abhängig von den HOBr - und DMS -Flüssen sowohl die DMS als auch die Bromoform -
Konzentration im Meerwasser beeinflussen kann . Dies kann sich auch auf den Gasaustausch von DMS 
und Bromoform auswirken und damit verbunden auf die atmosphärischen Konzentrationen dieser 
Verbindungen un d assoziierte atmosphärenchemische Prozesse. Deshalb sollte  die Reaktion zwischen 
DMS und HOBr in marinen biogeochemischen Modellen berücksichtigt werden , insbesondere für 
Situationen welche durch eine hohe DMS - und HOBr -Produktion charakterisiert sind  (z.B. Orte und 
Zeiträume wo vermehrt Algenblüten auftreten ). 
Basierend auf der Erkenntnis, dass HOBr als Senke für marines DMS wirken kann, stellt sich die Frage 
ob HOBr auch eine bedeutende Senke für die Se-analoge Verbindung von DMS (Dimethylselenid, 
DMSe ) darstellen kann, zumal organische S elen -Verbindungen gewöhnlich eine höhere Reaktivität 
aufweisen als ihre analogen  Schwefel -Verbindungen. Analog zu marinem DMS ist auch marines DMSe 
die wichtigste Selenspezies, die vom Ozean in die Atmosphäre emittiert wird. Atmosphärischer 
Transport vom Ozean zur terrestrischen B iosphäre stellt dabei eine Selenquelle für terrestrische 
Ökosysteme und Nahrungsketten  dar. 
Selen hat ähnliche chemische Eigenschaften wie Schwefel (beide Elemente sind Chalkogene, das heisst 
sie gehören zur 6. Hauptgruppe des Periodensystems). Es gibt aber einen grossen Unterschied der 
beiden Elemente: Die Umweltkonzentrationen oder –flüsse von Selen sind mehrere 
Grössenordnungen kleiner als diejenigen von Schwefel. Beispielsweise ist die durchs chnittliche 
Schwefelkonzentration  (Sulfat)  im Meerwasser 884 mg L-1, während Selen im Mittel nur in einer  
Konzentration von 0.08 µg L-1 vorkommt (Se/S Konzentrationsverhältnis im Meerwasser ≈ 1 ×10-7). 
Interessanterweise wird in marinen Algen und anderen Le bewesen aber ein höheres intrazelluläres 
Se/S Konzentrationsverhältnis beobachtet ( ≈10-3 - 10-4), was auf eine bevorzugte Selenaufnahme 
gegenüber der Aufnahme von Schwefel in diesen Organismen schliessen lässt und die positiven 
biologischen Effekte von Sel en verdeutlich t. Das höhere Se/S Konzentrationsverhältnis in der marinen 
Biota ist konsistent mit den ebenfalls höheren natürlichen Se/S Emissionen in der marinen  
Umwelt (≈6.5 ×109 g Jahr-1 Se gegenüber ≈35 ×1012 g Jahr-1 S; Se/S marine biogene Emissionen ≈  2×10-
4). 
Die absolut geringeren marinen Selen - gegenüber den Schwefelemissionen lassen vermuten, dass 
DMSe – im Gegensatz zu DMS – keine erwarteten Effekte aufs Klima hat. Jedoch spielt DMSe wie schon    
x 
 oben angedeutet eine wichtige Rolle für die Umverteilung von Se vom Ozean auf die terrestrische 
Biosphäre und beeinflusst auf diese Weise die Selenverfügbarkeit von Böden, Selenkonzentration in 
Nahrungsmitteln und Selenversorgung durch die Nahrung . 
Wie die se Zusammenhänge zeigen , hat DMSe eine hohe biologische Relevanz  und entsprechend haben 
Prozesse, welche.  die marinen Konzentrationen und den Gasaustausch von DMSe beeinflussen , eine 
grosse Bedeutung . Deshalb wurde  die Kinetik der Reaktion zwischen HOBr un d DMSe und potentielle 
Auswirkungen für die marine DMSe -Konzentration  untersucht . DMSe wird mit HOBr zu DMSeO 
oxidiert , mit einer Geschwindigkeitskonstante 2. Ordnung von  8.3  107 M-1 s-1. Dies ist ca. ein Faktor 
20 geringer als die Geschwindigkeitskonsta nte 2. Ordnung für die Reaktion  zwischen HOBr und DMS. 
Im Gegensatz zu DMS zeigte sich bei DMSe aber eine höhere Reaktivität mit HOBr in Chlorid - und 
Bromid -haltigem synthetischem Meerwasser ( k’’ = 5.4   108 M-1 s-1), was wahrscheinlich auf andere  
reaktive  Bromspezies ( z.B. Br2) zurückzuführen ist. Die immer noch langsamere DMSe -HOBr Kinetik 
gegenüber der DMS -HOBr Kinetik im Meerwasser lässt vermuten, dass  HOBr keine vergleichbare 
Bedeutung als Senke für marines DMSe hat, wie das bei marinem DMS der Fall i st. Die berechnete 
Geschwindigkeitskonstante n 1. Ordnung für den DMSe -Abbau durch Reaktion mit HOBr ( ≈2.1  10-6 s-
1 - 1.4  10-5 s-1) sind ca. 1 -2 Grössenordnungen kleiner als der dokumentiere DMSe -Abbau durch 
photochemische Oxidation. Jedoch ist die Date ngrundlage für DMSe -Abbauprozesse in der marinen 
Umwelt sehr spärlich , was es schwierig macht die relative Bedeutung der HOBr -DMSe Reaktion für den 
marinen DMSe -Abbau zu beurteilen.  
Die Reaktivität von HOBr mit anderen organischen S elen -Verbindungen (Dimethyldiselenid, DMDSe, 
Diphenylselenid, DPSe; Diphenyldiselenid, DPDSe; Selenomethionin, SeMet; Selenocystin, SeCys 2) 
wurde auch untersucht . DMDSe ist eine weitere volatile Organselen -Spezies im Meerwasser, welche 
aber in geringeren Konzentrationen vor kommt als DMSe. SeMet und SeCys 2 sind selenhaltige 
Aminosäuren mit einer bedeutenden Funktion zur Verminderung von oxidativem Stress und können 
auch extrazellulär im Meerwasser vorkommen (z.B. nach Zelllysis). Diese Verbindungen wurden vor 
ihrer Verwendung  zu N-acetyliertem -SeMet and N-acetyliertem -SeCys 2 acetyliert , um die 
Aminogruppe zu deaktivieren. DPSe und DPDSe  wurden untersucht  da diese Spezies die Aryl -analogen 
Verbindungen zu DMSe und DMDSe darstellen und zusätzliche Informationen über die Reaktivität von 
organischen S elen -Verbindungen liefern. DPSe und DPDSe sind industriell produzierte Verbindungen 
und haben keine bekannte R elevanz für die aquatische  Umwelt. Mit dieser Auswahl von organischen 
Selen -Verbindungen konnten wir den Effekt von verschiedenen Substituenten (Alkyl - und Phenyl -
Gruppen) und de s Oxidations zustands von  Selen (Monoselenide: Se[ -II], Disel enide: Se[ -I]) auf  die 
Reaktionskinetik mit HOBr untersuchen. Volatile Se -Spezies (DMSe, DMDSe) wurden mit SPME -GC/MS 
quantifiziert, während nicht -volatile Se -Spezies (DPSe, DPDSe, N-acetyliertes -SeMet, N-acetyliertes -   
xi 
 SeCys 2) mit «Hochleistungsflüssigchromatographie in Komb ination mit UV -Detektion» (HPLC/UV) 
quantifiziert wurden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen , dass alle untersuchten organische Se -Spezies schnell mit 
HOBr reagieren, mit Geschwindigkeitskonstanten  2. Ordnung  zwischen 9.4   106 und 3.2   108 M-1 s-1. 
Die alkylierten Verbindungen DMSe und DMDSe reagierten schneller mit HOBr als die analogen Phenyl -
Spezies DPSe und DPDSe ( kDMSe = 8.3   107 M-1 s-1; kDPSe = 4.0   107 M-1 s-1; kDMDSe  = 5.0   107 M-1 s-1; 
kDPDSe  = 9.4   106 M-1 s-1). Die Monoselen spezies DMSe, DPSe und N-acetyliertes -SeMet reagierten alle 
schneller als die analogen Diselen spezies DMDSe, DPDSe und N-acetyliertes -SeCys 2 (kDMSe = 8.3 × 107 
M-1 s-1; kDMDSe  = 5.0   107 M-1 s-1; kDPSe = 4.0   107 M-1 s-1; kDPDSe  = 9.4   106 M-1 s-1; kN-acetylated -SeMet = 3.2   
108 M-1 s-1; kN-acetylated SeCys2  = 4.4   107 M-1 s-1). Für Diselenide wurde ein HOBr -Verbrauch von 3 mol HOBr 
pro mol reagiertem Diselenid beobachtet, was auf einen schnelleren sekundären und tertiären 
Oxidationsschritt gegenüber der primären Oxidationsre aktion schliessen lässt.  
Besonders die hohe Reaktivität von N-acetyliertem -SeMet mit HOBr ( k’’ = 3.2  108 M-1 s-1) ist 
bemerkenswert da (i) diese Reaktion ca. 2 Grössenordnungen schneller ist als die Reaktion von HOBr 
mit der  analogen  S-Verbindung Methionin (Met), (ii) SeMet eine der häufigsten vorkommenden Selen -
Aminosäure in Lebewesen ist und (iii) SeMet als bekannter Radikalfänger wirkt. In diesem 
Zusammenhang könnte SeMet auch eine bedeutende Verbindung für d as Abfangen  von HOBr se in und 
damit zur Verminderung von HOBr -induziertem oxidativem Stress beitragen.  
Die selenhaltigen Oxidationsprodukte wurden in separaten Oxidationsexperimenten ermittelt. Dabei 
wurden verschiedene molare Verhältnisse zwischen HOBr und den Se -Spezies verwen det (HOBr:Se -
Spezies = 0:1, 1:1, 3:1, 10:1). Se -haltige Oxidationsprodukte wurden durch hochauflösende 
Massenspektrometrie (HR -MS) und Flüssigchromatographie in Kombination mit induktiv  gekoppelte  
Plasma  Tandem  Massenspektrometrie (LC -ICP-MS/MS) identifizi ert. Die Oxidation von DMSe durch 
HOBr führte zur Bildung von Dimethylselenoxid (DMSeO) als einziges Produkt. DMSeO wurde nicht in 
höher oxidierte Selenone umgewandelt , wenn HOBr im Überschuss verwendet wurde, womit DMSeO 
als stabiles Endprodukt der DMSe -HOBr Reaktion betrachtet werden kann. Auch die anderen 
Monoselenide (DPSe und N -acetyliertes -SeMet) wurden zum jeweiligen Selenoxid oxidiert. Bei der 
Oxidation von DMDSe mit HOBr wurde  Methanselenin -Säure als Hauptprodukt, mit einer maximalen 
Bildung für ei n molares HOBr:DMDSe Verhältnis  von 3 . Bei höheren molaren HOBr:DMDSe 
Verhältnissen (HOBr:DMDSe = 10) wurde Methanselenin -Säure zu einem Produkt oxidiert, welches 
nicht identifiziert werden konnte (dabei können Selenit  und Selenat  ausgeschlossen werden). Ä hnlich 
wie DMDSe bildeten auch die anderen Diselenid -Verbindungen (DPDSe und N-acetyliertes -SeCys 2) die 
korrespondierenden Selenin -Säuren.

Introduction  
1.1 Ocean -atmosphere coupling by volatile compounds  
Volat ile chemical compounds that are abiotically or biogenically produced in the ocean can be 
transported into the atmosphere, contributing to atmospheric processes as well as global 
biogeochemical cycl es of various chemical elements.  Therefore, the ocean -atmosphere interface plays 
an importa nt role in sea -air exchange of volatile compounds. Hypobromous acid (HOBr) is a non -
volatile compound but with an important influence on both marine and atmospheric concentrations 
of brominated volatile organic compounds, as explained in the next section.  
1.2 Hypobromous acid production in the ocean and its connection to the 
production of brominated volatile organic compounds  
Hypobromous acid (HOBr) is a strong oxidant, which is formed in water treatment processes1 due to 
its fast production by the reaction between hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and bromide (Br-).2 However, 
HOBr is also widely produced in natural and biological systems. In mammals and humans, HOBr is a 
product of enzymatic reactions of eosinophil peroxidases3-5 and thereby contributes to oxidative 
stress. HOBr also exists in the marine environment since it is formed via abiotic and b iotic pathways in 
marine waters . HOBr is  also abiotically produced via the oxidation of Br- by ozone (O 3; equation 1.1) or 
HOCl ( equation 1.2). Thereby, the relatively high Br- concentration in seawater (840 µM)6 leads to a 
fast production of HOBr. However, of greater relevance is its biogenic production via a two -electron 
oxidation of Br- by H 2O2, catalyzed by vanadium -dependent haloperoxidase (V -HPO) enzymes 
(equation 1.3): 
O3 + Br-      OBr- + O 2   k’’ = 160 M-1 s-1    (1.1)7 
HOCl + Br-      HOBr + Cl-  k’’ = 1.55   103 M-1 s-1   (1.2)8 
             V-HPO   
H2O2 + Br- + H+       HOBr + H 2O      (1.3)9, 10   Chapter 1. Introduction  
2 
 HOBr concentrations in marine waters are unknown,  howev er, as vanadium -dependent 
haloperoxidases are widely distributed in the marine environment and present in a large number of 
brown, red and green seaweeds, diatoms, bacteria and fungi,9 an extensive production and a 
widespread occurrence of HOBr in the ocean can be expected. With a pKa of 8.8,11 HOBr exists mainly 
in its prot onated form in marine seawater (pH 8) and under physiological conditions, i.e. in organisms 
(pH 6 -8). 
The organism -specific advantageous of HOBr production, i.e. the reason for existence of 
haloperoxidase activity, is not well understood up to now. It has been suggested that production of 
HOBr may help to keep H 2O2 at a constant level during high photosynthetic activities which can be seen 
as a prevention of oxidative stress.12 Other r esearchers refer to the biocidal properties of HOBr, which 
help to control the colonization on biological surfaces.13-15 
Once HOBr i s produced it reacts fast with a variety of organic compounds containing electron -rich 
moieties, either via electron transfer reaction (forming org. C ox) or substitution reaction (forming 
brominated organic compounds, Br -org. C) (Figure 2.1).16 Phenolic moieties are nucleophilic functional 
groups of dissolved organic matter (DOM) which are  susceptible for the electrophilic attack of HOBr.17, 
18 HOBr underg oes substitution reactions with phenols resulting in mono -, di- and tribromophenols,19 
which decay  via a haloform reaction to polybrominated volatile organic compounds, of which 
bromoform (CHBr 3) is the dominant species.20, 21  
It is well accepted that HOBr is the major precursor of CHBr 3 and other brominated volatile organic 
compounds, and that both HOBr and the quality of DOM (i.e. reactive DOM components) are the main 
drivers for CHBr 3 formation.18, 20 Not surprisingly, CHBr 3 concentrations are often observed to correlate 
with biological productivity.20, 22 -25 Particularly, elevated CHBr 3 concentrations are reported f or coastal 
and shelf regions, which can be linked to macroalgae and seaweed activities,26 as well as the nature of 
coastal DOM, which is provided with a high content of humic material.27 A stimulating effect for CHBr 3 
formation is also described for environmental stressors, which induce oxidative stress. Several studies 
reported that the formation of halogenated volatile org anic compounds (including CHBr 3) is positively 
influenced by high light intensities15, 28 -30 and high temperature,31, 32 which might be linked to H 2O2 and 
subsequent HOBr production. Indeed, an increased H 2O2 production was observed in algal cell 
cultures33(biotic) and in surface and ground water (abiotic)34 at higher irradiances, and halogenated 
volatile organic compounds were produced in greater quantities after H 2O2 addition to incubations of 
marine algal cultures.30, 35 Herewith, the relation between high irradiance, H 2O2 and bromoform 
production is in good  agreement with the previously discussed H 2O2 transformation into HOBr as a 
strategy in th e context of oxidative stress prevention.    Chapter 1. Introduction  
3 
 The major loss of CHBr 3 in seawater is its volatilization to the atmosphere.23 Therefore, high CHBr 3 
concentrations in surface waters correlate with high atmospheric mixing ratios of CHBr 3.23 In addition 
to CHBr 3, other volatile bromine speci es (e.g. molecular bromine, Br 2; brominechloride, BrCl) are 
produced in sea spray/sea salt aerosols, via the acid -catalyzed reaction between HOBr, Br- and Cl-.36-38 
These volatile bromine species, including CHBr 3 and other brominated volatile organic compounds, are 
photolyzed to Br atoms  (Br●) in the atmosphere,36, 39 which initiate a catalytic ozone -destructive cycle 
(Figure 1.1).40, 41 The significance of these  natural bromine sources for tropospheric and stratospheric 
bromine loadings, and the relevance of Br for tropospheric and stratospheric O 3 depletion is 
sufficiently well -known. Volatile inorganic bromine species (e.g. Br 2, BrCl) are a major source for 
tropospheric inorganic bromine and their contribution to total O 3 loss is estimated to be 10 -20%.42  
Dibromomethane (CH 2Br2) and CHBr 3 are major brominated very -short -lived substances (Br -VSLS) that 
are efficiently transported above the tropopause level and therefore contribute to stratospheric 
bromine, resulting in stratospheric O 3 degradation. Currently it is estimated that 4 -12% of O 3 depletion 
in the lower stratosphe re is associated to these VSLS (O 3 decomposition by bromine species: 85%).43 
Several studies suggested that atmospheric models should include the influence of biogenic bromine 
species (particularly CHBr 3 and CH 2Br2) to represent accurately the measured ozone concentrations in 
both the troposphere and stratosp here.44-46  Furthermore, special attention is attributed to Br -VSLS as 
increased emissions of these compounds are predicted under future climate conditions.47-50 Contrary 
to Br -VSLS, other O 3 depleting compounds, such as anthropogenic chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and 
halons, will play a relatively smaller role for O 3 depletion in future, as the atmospheric loadings of these 
compounds is decreasing sin ce the inception of the Montreal protocol.51, 52 Therefore, a relatively 
higher contribution of Br -VSLS is expected for future atmospheric O 3 loss, which may slow dow n the 
recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer.  
Ozone is not only a protecting agent in the stratosphere against UV -radiation.  It is also a strong oxidant 
and greenhouse gas in the troposphere. In this sense, a link can be established between HOBr, biogenic 
bromine formation (i.e. volatile organic and inorganic bromine species), the composition of the global 
atmosphere (via atmospheric bromine chemistry) and climate (via O 3 degradation). This impact chain 
demonstrates the environmental relevance of the HOBr involving reactions in marine waters.    Chapter 1. Introduction

Figure 1.1: Marine HOBr production by seaweed, phytoplankton and cyanobacteria and its reaction 
with DOM. CHBr 3 formed via the HOB r-DOM reaction is volatilized to the atmosphere, where it is 
photolyzed to Br atoms  (Br●), initiating a catalytic ozone destruction cycle. Another source of 
atmospheric Br● is inorganic Br 2 and BrCl, which are produced by the reaction between HOBr and the 
halides Br- and Cl-. 
1.3 Production and degradation of DMS in the marine environment and its 
role for climate  
Another biogenically produced species in the marine environment is the volatile organic sulfur (S) 
compound dimethyl sulfide (DMS). With an annual  sea-to-air flux of 28 Tg S year-1,53 DMS is the 
dominant/main sulfur compound emitted from the ocean into the atmosphere.54 Via gas - and aqueous 
phase reactions in the atmosphere, DMS is oxidized to sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) and methane sulfonic acid 
(MSA), which trigger the formation  of aerosols and clouds (Figure 1.2).55-58 Theref ore, volatilization of 
DMS from the ocean into the atmosphere is of high importance for the marine sulfur cycle as it 
transports and redistributes S on a global scale and affects climate by a negative radiative forcing.59, 60 
The cooling effect of DMS was quantified to be -1.8 Wm-2,61 which corresponds to ca. -1.3 K. 
Consequently, a doubling of the ocean -atmospheric DMS emissions would result in an additional 
radiative forcing and temperature change of -1.8 Wm-2 and -1.3 K, respectively.  
The major source of marine DMS is the enzymatic cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionat e (DMSP) by 
DMSP lyases, which are widespread in algal species and bacteria (Figure 1.2). Beside s DMS formation, 
  Chapter 1. Introduction

 byproducts of DMSP cleavage are acrylate and H+. DMSP is produced mainly by higher plants and 
marine algae,62 but its biosynthesis has also been documented for animals63 and recently for marine 
bacteria.64  DMSP is regarded to be the most abundant organic sulfur species in the marine 
environment65 and it offers several physiological functions for marine organisms: It represents an 
important carbon and sulfur source,66-68 acts as a cryoprotectant62 and maintains the osmotic 
balance.62, 69 Its production also serves to regulate the intracellular nitrogen content under conditions 
of excess carbon and energy, and limited nitrogen availability.62 An interesting aspect is that some 
bacteria prefer DMSP over sulfate as a source for sulfur, even though the DMSP concentration is ca. 
seven orders of magnitude lower  in marine waters compared  to sulfate.70 Even more remarkable, the 
survival of some marine bacteria depends on the availability of DMSP, as they are not able to use 
sulfate as a sulfur source.71 In this context, DMSP plays an important physiological and ecologi cal role 
as it represents an important connection between marine algae (which produce, release and 
metabolize DMSP) and bacteria (which metabolize DMSP).  
In comparison to algae, which degrade DMSP to DMS via the DMSP -lyase pathway, bacteria have an 
additi onal DMSP degradation pathway, that is a demethylation and demethiolation step of DMSP, 
resulting in methanethiol production (Figure 1.2).72 This process is of high interest, as it competes with 
DMSP cleavage, and therefore affects DMS production. DMSP decomposition in bacteria via 
demethylation/demethiolation is energetically more beneficial than DMSP cleavage, as methanethiol 
is used in prot ein synthesis and energy production.70, 73 Therefore, the reason of existence of the 
cleavage pathway has been questioned and the questions arises of why it may be preferred over the 
demethy lation/demethiolation pathway. One explanation relates to the antimicrobial properties of 
acrylate74 and H+ ions, and therefore it has been hypothesized that this pathway functions as a defense 
mecha nism against microbial attack.75, 76

Figure 1.2: DMS production in the ocean and its role in climate. DMS is enzymatically produced via 
cleavage of its precursor DMSP. This process proceeds both in algae and bacteria, while synthesis of 
DMSP proceeds only in algae and demethylation/demethiolation of DMSP (an alternative DMSP 
degradation pathway) only in bacteria. As a volatile compound, DMS is volatilized from the ocean to 
the atmosphere, where it is oxidized to sulfuric acid and MSA , which trigger the formation of aerosols 
and clouds, thereby affecting climate.  
It has also been hypothesized that the nutrient availability may affect the proportion between DMSP 
lyase and demethylation/demethiolation. Kiene et al.77 suggested that low DMSP concentrations 
relative to the bacterial carbon and sulfur demand will favor the demethylation/demethiolation 
pathway due to its thermodynamic advan tage over the lyase pathway, whereas at high DMSP 
concentrations relative to the bacterial carbon and sulfur demand, the lyase  pathway is preferred 
which serves to dissipate excess sulfur and energy. Furthermore, the removal of excess sulfur from the 
cell via DMSP cleavage is facilitated. DMSP as a zwitterionic compound cannot easily penetrate the 
algal cell membrane, whereas the volatile and neutral cleavage product DMS can be much easier 
removed from the cell.62  
  Chapter 1. Introduction

 In contrast , nitrogen limitation has been linked to increased DMS production as it is a cause of oxidative 
stress. For example, Sunda et al. (2007) observed that nitrogen limitation in coccolithophorides 
increased DMS produ ction from cleaved DMSP (as a result of an increased DMSP -lyase activity).78 The 
higher oxidative stress due to nitrogen limitation was explained by (i) a decreased photosynthetic 
efficiency, (ii) a decreased synthesis of antioxidant enzymes and (iii) a restriction in enzyme systems 
that r epair intracellular oxidative damage.78 Indeed, oxidative stress as a driver for DMSP production 
and DMSP cleavage to DMS has already been described earlier.  Sunda et al. (2002)79 reported an 
effective antioxidative effect of the DMSP cleavage and DMS oxidation products as these can scavenge 
and neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS). The enzymatic cleavage of only one DMSP molecule may 
neutral ize up to four ROS species. The antioxidant effect of DMSP and its degradation/oxidation 
products is also supported by other researchers, who observed an upregulation of DMSP formation 
and its cleavage under high oxidative stress conditions .80-83  
The stimulating effects of N -limitation and oxidative conditions for DMS production may cause high 
surface DMS concentrations despite a low biomass, which represents a decoupling between DMS 
production and chlorophyll concentration. This phenomenon is often referred as the DMS “summer 
paradox”.84, 85 A weak link between DMS and primary production is in contrast to the biomass -
correlated production/concentration profile of CHBr 3 (Figure 1.3).  
Following the stimulating effects  of N -limitation and oxidative stress for DMSP -cleavage to DMS, an 
interesting question is how this relates to future climate conditions. Rising temperatures provoke an 
increased thermal stratification of the surface layer, which results on the one hand in  a reduced 
nitrogen availability, and on the other hand in a higher expos ure of phytoplankton to UV -radiation. 
These oxidative stressors are expected to increase DMSP -cleavage to DMS and will select for high 
DMSP producing species such as the coccolithopor id Emiliana huxleyi .78 However, the limited nutrient 
availability leads to a reduced primary productivity, which will negatively affect DMS production. 
Therefore, it remains unclear how a future climate will influence marine DMS production and how this 
translates to future marine DMS concentrations and atmosp heric fluxes.  
The concentration of DMS in marine surface waters and associated ocean -atmospheric fluxes depends 
not only on production of DMS (i.e. via DMSP cleavage), but also on its removal processes. Three main 
DMS removal processes have been reported so far, which are biological consumption, photolysis and 
air-sea gas exchange. Integrated over the whole water column, bacterial consumption of DMS is 
regarded to be the dominant DMS removal process.86-88 DMS  is consumed by bacteria as it serves as 
an electron source for photosynthesis, as well as a source of carbon and energy.89-91 Photolysis occurs 
especially near the water surface in the form of photochemical degradation of DMS. The 
photochemical oxidati on rate of DMS is mainly a function of the irradiation intensity and the amount   Chapter 1. Introduction

 of photo -sensitizing compounds (i.e. DOM concentration).92, 93 Recent studies reported increased 
photoche mically induced transformation of DMS by halide radicals which can be formed via an 
hydroxyl radical (●OH)-dependent94 or an ●OH-independent95 pathway. DMS rem oval via sea -air gas 
exchange (i.e. volatilization) takes place at the surface and is driven by the difference in concentration 
of DMS in the water and in the atmosphere as well as the gas transfer velocity, which is mainly a 
function of wind speed.96

 1.4 Link between the marine S (DMS) and Br (HOBr) cycle and associated 
research questions  
In the context of so far known DMS sinks, the question arises whether HOBr – via its reaction with DMS 
– could represent another major sink for marine DMS. There are several indications supporting this 
hypothesis. HOBr as an electrophilic compound might un dergo reactions with the nucleophi le DMS. 
Kinetic studies showed so far that HOBr reacts fast with thiols99 and thioethers .99, 100 For example, 
second -order rate constants of 1.2   107 M-1 s-1 99 and 4   106 M-1 s-1 99, 100 have been reported for the 
reacti on of HOBr with cysteine and methionine, respectively. Furthermore, it has been shown that 
DMS and chlorine  (HOCl)  react fast, with a second -order rate constant of 2.6   109 M-1 s-1.101 The fact 
that both DMS and HOBr are enzymatically produced by various marine organisms and that both 
compounds are upregulated under oxidative stress9, 10, 30, 78, 79, 81, 82 suggests a co -production (and 
potential co-existence) of the two compounds in marine waters, and therefore it is likely that these 
two compounds have favorable conditions to react with each other .   
1.4.1 Short presentation of the 1st research project  
The reactivity between DMS and HOBr is unknown up to now and therefore its potential relevance for 
marine DMS concentrations cannot be assessed. Therefore, in the first project, kinetic batch 
experiment s were performed  using competition kinetics, to determine the second -order -rate constant 
of the DMS -HOBr reaction. Sulfite was used as a competitor for DMS, as its reactivity with HOBr is 
known ( k’’HOBr+SO32 - = 5  109 M-1 s-1).11 DMS was quantified via solid phase microextraction coupled with 
gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (SPME -GC/MS),102 whereas sulfite was determined 
colorimetrically . Furthermore, in this firs t project, the products of the reaction between DMS and HOBr 
were identified using a new high  performance  liquid  chromatography  in combination with inductively  
coupled  plasma  tandem  mass  spectrometry  method ( HPLC -ICP-MS/MS ) aimed at quantifying DMS, its 
precursor DMSP and the oxidized compounds “dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)”, “dimethyl sulfone 
(DMSO 2)”, “methane sulfinic acid (MSIA)”, “methane sulfonic acid (MSA)” and “sulfate (SO 42-)”. Finally, 
it was investigated how relevant the DMS -HOBr reaction is as a sink for marine DMS. For this purpose, 
first-order rate constants for the DMS -HOBr reaction were compared to the reported first -order 
degradation rates of DMS via bacterial consumption, photochemical oxidation and sea -air gas 
exchange.  
1.4.2 Short presenta tion of the 2nd research project  
The reaction between DMS and HOBr may not only influence DMS concentrations but also affect the 
formation of brominated volatile organic compounds, as the reaction between DMS and HOBr may   Chapter 1. Introduction

 compete with the reaction between HOBr and DOM (Figure 1.4). Therefore, in a second research 
project, the relevance of the DMS -HOBr reaction in terms of DMS consumption and CHBr 3 production 
was investigated by kinetic experiments and modeling DMS and CHBr 3 concentrations under natural 
conditions. Batch experiments were performed to study the competition between the DMS -HOBr and 
DOM -HOBr reactions. A buffered artificial seawater medium (pH 8; containing the Cl- and Br- 
concentrations of seawater), and low -aromatic (i.e. with a low content of phenolic moieties) natural 
organic matter reference standards from the international humic substances society (IHSS) (i.e., Pony 
lake fulvic acid, PLFA; Upper Mississippi River Natural Organic matter, UMRNOM) as proxies f or marine 
DOM were used to mimick chemical composition of seawater. Two separate series of batch 
experiments were carried out. In a first series, variable HOBr concentrations were tested using an 
environmentally relevant DMS:phenolic moiety concentration r atio to study the fraction of DMS 
consumed by HOBr. In a second series of experiments, variable DMS concentrations were used to study 
the potential influence of the reaction between DMS and HOBr on the formation of CHBr 3. The reaction 
between HOBr and DMS may reduce the availability of HOBr for reaction with DOM, leading to 
suppressed CHBr 3 formation (Figure 1.4). Furthermore, we also performed kinetic experiments with 
in-house designed and constructed triple chamber diffusion -reactors, mimicking the natura l marine 
DMS and HOBr diffusion fluxes, where biogenically produced DMS and HOBr are released into the 
surrounding seawater via a diffusive flux . Briefly, the diffusion -reactors consist of two outer chambers 
(for DMS and HOBr solutions) and a middle chambe r (UMRNOM so lution). The outer chambers are 
separated from the middle chamber by two nanofiltration membranes, which control the diffusion of 
HOBr and DMS from the outer to the inner chamber. In the inner chamber the reactions of HOBr with 
both DMS and DOM  were studied . In these experiments, DMS and HOBr flux to phenolic moiety 
concentration ratios were selected that reflect natural ratios in algal blooms.  
The initial compounds and main reaction products (i.e. DMSO and CHBr 3) in the middle chamber were 
mea sured over two hours and the results from these diffusion -reactor experiments were verified by a 
kinetic diffusion -reaction model. In this model, DMS and DMSO concentrations in the middle chamber 
were modelled over time, based on (i) the DMS and HOBr fluxe s determined in the diffusion -reactor 
experiments, (ii) the DMS -HOBr kinetic s, and (iii) the kinetic s for the reactions between HOBr and 
phenolic moiet ies from the scientific literature (i.e. phenol, mono -, di-, tribromophenol).    Chapter 1. Introduction  
11 
 As in the diffusion -react or experiments neither all relevant reactions can be considered nor the 
whole range of natural occurring fluxes can be taken into account . Therefore, the diffusion -reaction 
model was extended by including major sinks for marine DMS and HOBr, more complex b romine and 
iodine chemistry and DMS and HOBr fluxes  typical for algal blooms , which vary over 4 orders of 
magnitude (10-13 – 10-9 M1 s-1). Specifically, the extended diffusion -reaction model was used to (i) 
study the influence of varying DMS fluxes on CHBr 3 production, and (ii) study DMS consumption as a 
result of varying HOBr fluxes.

DOM -HOBr system (for batch and diffusion -reactor experiments) was extended by othe r reactants for 
DMS and HOBr in the extended diffusion -reaction model, in order to reflect the complex conditions of 
the marine environment  better .  
1.5 The unique redox properties of selenium and related beneficial effects for 
organisms  
Selenium (Se) is a n element that has similar chemical properties as S . It is in the same group of S, i.e., 
the chalcogens (sixth group of the periodic table). However, S and Se have different redox properties: 
Se-containing compounds are generally con sidered to be more nucl eophilic and electrophi lic 
compared to their S -analogs.103-105 This behavior translates to faster oxidation reactions of nucleophilic 
Se-compounds and faster reduction reactions of electrophilic Se  species compared to their S -
analogs.106-109 For example, the Se -amino acids “Selenocysteine (SeCys)”  and “Selenomethionine 
(SeMet)” are widely reported to be more readily oxidized  compared to the S -analog compounds 
“cysteine (Cys)” and “methionine (Met)” (Table 1.1).103, 106 -111 In contrast , the oxidation products of 
SeCys and SeMet oxida tion, i.e., diselenide “Selenocystine (SeCys 2)” and “methionine -Selenoxide”, can 
be more readily  reduced back to SeCys and SeMet than the S -analogs “cystine” and “methionine -
  Chapter 1. Introduction  
12 
 oxide”, respectively . This  demonstrates an efficient redox cycling.106, 107, 109, 112 Therefore, SeCys and 
SeMet are not only highly efficient in neutralizing reactive oxygen species but their oxidation products 
also resist permanent oxidation. These beneficial catalytic and antioxidativ e properties are the reason 
why Se is actively incorporated into proteins (in the form of SeCys), even though Se is depleted over S 
and its insertion into protein is associated with high energetic costs.113, 114 Currently , known 
selenoproteins are glutathione  peroxidases, deiodinases, thioredoxin reductases, selenophosphate 
synthetase -2 and selenoprotein P.113, 115 The preferred uptake of Se over S is reflected by a higher molar 
ratio of Se to S in phytoplankton (7 ×10-5) in comparison to dissolved Se and S in seawater (Se to S ratio 
of 3×10-8).116 Indeed, it is well -known that Se accumulati on is high at the first trophic level, with an 
accumulation coefficient of ≈104 for some microalgae.117

Undersupply of Se results in a number of well -known human health  issues and diseases, including 
cardio -myopathy (Keshan disease), cancer, immune and endocrine disfunction, muscle and bone 
disorder, neurodegenerative diseases, decreased thyroid function and male infertility.118, 119 It has been 
estimated that up to 1 billion people worldwide may be affected by an inadequate Se supply, however, 
exact numbers are not available 120 In contrast , expos ure to high Se concentrations results in toxic 
effects, due to nonspecific Se incorporation into proteins, substituting S and the reby causing 
malformation and malfunction of proteins.121 Furthermore, the electrophilic properties of Se -  Chapter 1. Introduction  
13 
 compounds (e.g. diselenides) increase the consumption of thiol functional groups in S -containing 
enzymes (e.g. in Glutathione), whereby these electrophilic Se  species behave as pro -oxidants and can 
induce oxidative stress at higher concentrations.106 Although concentration -dependent deficiency and 
toxicity issues are typical for essential micronutrients, for Se the tolerance window is particularly 
narrow.122 In this connection, it is significa nt that a link exist between Se distribution in soils and the 
nutritional status of Se: (i) An important dietary source of Se are food crops (e.g., cereals), (ii) Se 
contents in soils as well as Se speciation play an important role in how much Se is taken up by food 
crops . (iii) Heterogenous distributions of Se in soils (with Se -deficient and Se -excess areas, Figure 1.5) 
may affect the Se status of food crops and therefore dietary availability. Indeed, the Se -content in soil 
often correlates with the Se con tent in plants and other food products, and with the Se nutritional 
status of humans.120, 123 
Therefore, significant importance is attributed to the processes, which influence the Se -content in 
soils.  An important source of Se to soils is atmospheric deposition. Atmospheric Se is derived from 
anthropogenic and natural em ission fluxes, with contributions of 35 % and 65%, respectively.124 Of 
the natural emissions, the si ngle largest source is estimated to be Se biovolatilization from the ocean.  
 
Figure 1.5: Global modeled Se -distribution in soils (Jones et al. 2017)120 
1.6 The crucial role of volatile marine Se  species in the Se -cycle  
The main biogenic Se species emitted from the ocean to the atmosphere is DMSe, similarly to DMS 
being a major volatile S species. Marine DMSe and other marine volatile Se species (e.g. D MDSe, 
DMSeS) account for 50 -80% of natural Se emissions and 30 -50% of total Se emissions.124-128  Volatile 
Se is transported and oxidized in the atmosphere to inorganic selenite and selenate, which are 
deposited on land via wet and dry deposition (Figure 1.6). Wet deposition is the dominant sink for 
  Chapter 1. Introduction  
14 
 atmospheric Se and is estimated to contribute 81 % of atmospheric Se removal.124  As the marine 
environment is a source of Se to the land surface, via biovolatilization and subsequent atmospheric 
transport, it is important that sources and sinks of methylated Se species in marine settings are better 
understood.  
 
Figure 1.6: The glob al biogeochemical Se -cycle (from Feinberg et al. 2020)129  
1.7 Production of DMSe in the marine environment and link to marine S 
chemistry  
In analogy to DMS, the production of DMSe has been suggested to proceed via enzymatic cleavage of 
dimet hyl seleniopropionate by the enzyme DMSP lyase (DMSeP, i.e. the Se -analog of DMSP).130-132 
Some authors even suggest DMSeP cleavage as a major pathway for algal DMSe production,116, 131, 133 
even though the existence of DMSeP in the marine environment has not been verified so far.125, 134 
Besides DMSeP cleavage, other DMSe production pathways have been  discussed for marine algae in 
which methyl -SeMet135-137 and methaneselenol (MeSeH)138 are indicated as potential precursors. 137 In 
contrast , SeMet (and Methyl -SeMet) are also suggested precursors for DMSeP production in marine 
algae.131, 133 It is unclear whether DMSe production in marine organisms may directly proceed from 
methyl -SeMet metabolism or  if DMSe is rather formed via DMSeP lyase. Cooke & Bruland (1987)136 
discuss a direct DMSe production pathway from Methyl -SeMet (without DMSeP as  an intermediate). 
As methyl -SeMet is soluble, it may be expelled from the cell to surrounding seawater, where it may be 
(abiotically) hydrolyzed to DMSe.136  
  Chapter 1. Introduction  
15 
 Although DMS and DMSe both play a n important role in global S and Se cycles, their impact on 
atmospheric chemistry is not the same. Contrary to DMS, a major role of DMSe for atmospheric 
chemistry and climate is not expected, simply because of the three to four orders of magnitude smaller 
DMSe than DMS concentration s in marine waters. Selenones are not common products of selenoxide 
oxidation reactions in the aqueous phase,139, 140 while sulfones are produced by oxidation of 
sulfoxides.101, 141 -144 Furthermore, seleninic acids are often reported as the final products of diselenide 
oxidation reactions,145-148 whereas analog sulfinic acids are highly reactive towards O 3 and ●OH in 
aqueous phase and therefore only occur as intermediates.149, 150 In contrast , seleninic  acids can be 
reduced back to diselenides rapidly and non -enzymatically, while an anolog reduction of sulfinic acid 
to disulfides is only possible enzymatically at much slower rates.106 Contrary to selenite, which exists 
at concentrations similar to selenate in marine waters,151 its S-analog sulfite undergoes fast reactions 
with numerous oxidants11, 152 -154 and therefore does not exist at significant concentrations in seawater. 
These differences among S and Se are in agreem ent with the known fact that Se  species at high 
oxidation states (i.e. Se [ +VI]) are not common products.139 The relatively lower prevalence of Se in its 
highest oxidation state Se( +VI), i.e., selenate compared to S( +VI), i.e., sul fate, is illustrated by the 
difference in reactivity of sulfite and selenite with HOBr. While for sulfite a very high reactivity is 
reported for its reaction with HOBr (k SO3+HOBr = 5  109 M-1 s-1)11, the analog reactivity of selenite is six 
orders of magnitude lower (k SeO3+HOBr = 5.8   103 M-1 s-1).155  
Generally, it needs to be emphasized that compared to the marine S cycle, the marine Se cycle is 
relatively unknown, also due to the low aqueous concentrations of Se posing several analytical 
challenges.  
1.8 Studying reactions of organic selenium compounds with HOBr  and 
associated research questions  
Although a number of previous studies have investigated potential sources of DMSe, information 
about potential environmental sinks of DMSe is scarce. We previously hypothesized that HOBr might 
be a significant sink for marine DMS, and the same may also app ly for DMSe, considering the often 
reported higher reactivity of Se - than S -compounds. However, kinetic studies of organic Se compounds 
are limited and their potential reactions with HOBr are rarely taken into consideration. Therefore, in a 
third research project, the kinetics of the reaction between DMSe and HOBr was studied. In addition, 
other organic Se compounds were tested for their reactivities towards HOBr: Dimethyl diselenide 
(DMDSe), which is the diselenide -analog of DMSe and another organic Se -com pound produced in 
marine waters; diphenyl selenide (DPSe) and diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), which are the phenyl -  Chapter 1. Introduction  
16 
 analogs of DMSe and DMDSe, respectively, and used as green catalysts for industrial and medical 
purposes145, 156, 157; and the Se -amino acids SeMet and SeCys 2. So far only the kinetic s of the reaction 
between SeMet and HOBr has been investigated, with a second -order rate constant of 1.4  107 M-1 s-
1.158 The comparison of reactivities of monoselenides with diselenides, and alkyl with phenyl 
compounds is expected to give more insights into the effect of the redox state and substituents of 
organic Se compounds towards their reactivity with HOBr.  
Second -orde r rate constants were determined via competition kinetics using either resorcinol or 1,3,5 -
trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as competitive reaction partners. Volatile compounds (i.e. DMSe and 
DMDSe) were measured by SPME -GC/MS, whereas non -volatile co mpounds were q uantified by 
HPLC/ UV. Furthermore, reaction stoichiometries of the monoselenide and diselenide reactions with 
HOBr were examined to assess  the kinetics of secondary reactions. Oxidation experiments using 
different molar Se:HOBr ratios and subsequent measur ements by orbitrap -MS and LC -ICP-MS/MS 
were carried out to identify and quantify oxidation products of the studied reactions.  
Furthermore, the obtained second -order rate constants for the Se -organic compounds  can be 
compared with the HOBr reactivities of analog S -compounds, in case such data exists. Finally, it is 
important to assess the potential environmental relevance of the investigated reactions. DMSe, 
DMDSe, SeMet and SeCys 2 are natural Se -organic compounds, which are present in organisms or in 
seawa ter, where they may react with HOBr. For the volatile compounds DMSe and DMDSe, 
constituting a natural source of atmospheric Se, a high reactivity with HOBr could represent an 
important, yet undiscovered sink for these compounds, which may affect sea -air g as exchange, and 
subsequent Se -transport to land. In contrast , SeMet and SeCys 2, which are associated with the 
prevention of oxidative stress due to their antioxidative properties,159, 160 may act as scavengers for 
HOBr and re duce its adverse health effects.  
1.9 Overview of the thesis  
This thesis comprises 5 chapters which are composed of an introduction (chapter 1), three research 
chapters (chapters 2 -4) and one conclusion/outlook chapter (chapter 5). The research chapters are  
either already published (chapter 2), under review for publication (chapter 3) or in preparation for 
publication (chapter 4). The chapters are briefly summarized below.  
Chapter 2 investigates the reactivity of the reaction between HOBr and DMS and the re sulting  
oxidation products. A first -order degradation rate is calculated for marine DMS via its reaction with 
HOBr based on estimated  marine HOBr s teady -state concentration. This rate constant is compared 
with other marine DMS sinks and the environmental relevance of HOBr as a potential DMS sink is   Chapter 1. Introduction  
17 
 discussed . Furthermore, the reactivity of HOBr with DMSP, DMSO, DMSO 2 and MSA was studied  
(research project 1).  
Chapter 3 builds up on chapter 2 by studying the influence of the reaction betwee n DMS and HOBr in 
the presence of DOM on DMS consumption as well as CHBr 3 formation .  Lab experiments are 
performed with simplified seawater matrixes  and using PLFA and UMRNOM as proxies for marine 
DOM . In a series of batch experiments, DMS consumption and  CHBr 3 formation was studied for varying 
HOBr and DMS concentrations, respectively. In these experiments, DMS consumption was studied for 
environmentally relevant DMS:DOM concentration ratios. In diffusion -reaction experiments, the study 
of the reactions b etween DMS, DOM and HOBr was amended by including diffusion fluxes of DMS and 
HOBr, which mimicked the natural diffusion of DMS and HOBr from algal cells to the surrounding 
seaweater. Finally, in a marine diffusion -reaction model, the natural conditition w ere even better 
reflected. The t hree component system consisting of DMS, DOM and HOBr was extended by 
considering all relevant sinks for marine DMS and HOBr and the complex bromine and iodine chemistry 
(research project 2).  
Chapter 4 investigates the kine tic of the reaction of  HOBr with a selection of organic selenium 
compounds, including biological ly and environmental ly relevant Se  species such as DMS, DMDSe, 
SeMet and SeCys 2. The oxidation products of the reactions are determined and the biological and 
environmental relevance of the reactions is discussed (research project 3).  
Chapter 5 summarizes the major conclusions from the three studies and gives an outlook presenting 
open questions and further research directions.

Abstract  
Marine emissions of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) to the atmosphere play a fundamental role in the global 
sulfur (S) cycle and have important consequences for the Earth’s radiativ e balance. In the ocean, DMS 
is mainly produced by marine algae and bacteria, via cleavage of the precursor compound 
dimethylsu lfoniopropionate (DMSP). Here, we studied the reaction between DMS and the strong 
oxidant hypobromous acid (HOBr), which is also produced by marine algae. Further, reactions between 
DMS oxidation products and HOBr were studied. The second -order rate consta nts were determined in 
competition kinetic experiments using sulfite as a competitor. In addition, we developed a new HPLC -
ICP-MS/MS method to identify and quantify the oxidation products of DMS and related compounds. 
We found that HOBr reacts very fast wi th DMS to dimethyl  sulfoxide (DMSO), with a second -order rate 
constant of 1.6   109 M-1 s-1, while the subsequent oxidation of DMSO to dimethyl sulfone (DMSO 2) is 
much slower (0.4 M-1 s-1). Concentrations of DMSP, DMSO 2, and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) did not   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic

 decrease when exposed to excess concentrations of HOBr, implying that these S -compounds are not 
or only slightly reactive toward HOBr. A quantitative comparison of known DMS sinks shows that HOBr 
may be an important, hitherto neglected sink for marine DMS  that needs to be considered in ocean -
atmosphere chemistry models.  
2.1 Introduction  
With an annual flux of 20 -40 Tg S y ear-1,161, 162, 163 , 164 the volatile organic compound dimethyl sulfide 
(DMS, (CH 3)2S) is the most important reduced sulfur (S) species emitted to the atmosphere. Dimethyl 
sulfide plays a major rol e in the global redistribution of S between oceans and terrestrial systems. It 
can trigger the formation of aerosols and clouds, via its oxidation to SO 2 and sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4), 
thereby leading to a decrease in radiative forcing.55, 56, 59, 60 In marine waters, DMS is enzymatically 
produced by marine algae and bacteria via cleavage of the precursor compound 
dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP, C 5H10O2S), which also produces acrylate.165 DMSP has various 
important functions for marine organisms, e.g., it is an important carbon (C) and S source,66, 67 it acts  
as an osmolyte62, 69 and cryoprotectant,62 and its production and degradation can regulate t he 
intracellular nitrogen content under conditions of excess C and energy.62 Furthermore, DMSP and DMS 
are involved in grazing protection.75 In addition, an antioxidative function is attributed to these 
compounds, as well as to the DMS oxidation products dimethyl  sulfoxide (DMSO) and methanesulfinic 
acid (MSIA).79 Besides DMSP cleavage, a further DMSP degradation pathway is known for bacteria (e.g., 
cynaobacteria166, 167 and bacteria of the “Roseobacter” group70, 168, 169) i.e., 
demethylation/demethiolation, resulting in the production of methanethiol (MeSH, CH 4S). Kiene et al.  
(2000)77 suggested that the availability of DMSP and bacterial sulfur demand will control the fraction 
of DMSP that is cleaved to DMS and demethylated/demethiolated to MeSH. High DMSP 
concentrations in se awater coupled with low bacterial S demand should favor DMSP degradation via 
the lyase pathway, and thus DMS production, as the assimilative and energetic benefits of the 
demethylation/demethiolation pathway are less important under these conditions.165 In turn, the DMS 
produced is degraded, and the main sinks for marine DMS reported to date are air –sea gas exchange 
(kvent = 0.073 -0.23 d-1),  bacterial consumption ( kBC = 0.15 –0.77 d-1), and photochemical degradation 
(kphoto = 0.024 –0.12 d-1).170    
In addition to DMS, marine organisms can emit volatile halocarbons, such as polyhalogenated 
methanes  (CH 2X2, CHX 3, X = chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I)).9, 10, 21, 171 In addition to these 
biogenic emissions, inorganic volatile halogen compounds (e.g., Br2 and BrCl) are emitted, which are 
produced in sea spray under acid conditions.36 In the atmosphere, volatile Br species are photolyzed   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
20 
 to Br atoms (Br●), which are known for their destruction potential of stratospheric ozone (see Figure 
2.1). With a global flux of 1.5 –2.5 Gmol Br yr-1,23 bromoform (CHBr 3) is the largest single source of 
organic bromine172 and, together with dibromomethane (CH 2Br2: 0.78 -0.98 Gmol Br yr-1 23), it 
contributes 1 5–40% of stratospheric bromine.173 Bromoform is produced by the reaction of dissolved 
organic matter (DOM)9, 16, 20, 174 with hypobromous acid (HOBr), which is an important reactive Br 
species in marine waters.9, 20, 175 Hypobromous acid is produced abiotically, via the oxidation of 
bromide by ozone (O 3),7, 176 and biotically, by marine organisms via the oxidation of bromide (Br-) by 
hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), catalyzed by the vanadium -dependent haloperoxidase enzyme (V -HPO) and 
more specifically bromoperoxidase (V -BrPO)10, 15, 20, 177 (see Figure 2.1).  
 
Figure 2.1: Simplified scheme of the reaction between aqueous HOBr and DOM, leading to the 
formation of volatile organic bromine compounds, based on Wever and van der Horst (2013),9 Hill and 
Manley (2009),10 and Rehder (2014).178 The reaction between HOBr and DMS, which is investigated in 
this study, is ind icated by a question mark. We assume that the biological HOBr production pathway 
(via the catalyzed H 2O2-Br- reaction) is more relevant than the abiotic O 3-Br- reaction (dashed line) and 
the HOCl -Br- reaction pathway (not shown). DOM: dissolved organic matter; DMS: dimethyl sulfide; 
HOBr: hypobromous acid; CHBr 3: bromoform.  
Apart from the reactions of HOBr with DOM, a potential sink of HOBr, which is still unknown, is its 
reaction with DMS. Based on reported antioxidant properties of DMS79 and high reactivity of HOBr 
  Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
21 
 with reduced S groups, e.g. thioethers,99 we hypothesize that  the reaction between DMS and HOBr is  
fast and could thus present a sink for marine DMS. Furthermore, the reaction between HOBr and DMS 
potentially competes with the reaction between HOBr and phenolic components, ß-diketones, ß-
ketoacids, and may thus affect the formation of trihalomethanes ( THM), such as bromoform.179 To 
date, only very few studies have looked into reactions between DMS and bromine. One of these studies 
found that, compared to freshwater condit ions, seawater halides can increase photodegradation rates 
of DMS up to fivefold and that this increase could be attributed to photochemically generated halogen -
containing radicals (Br 2●- and ClBr●-) formed via the oxidation of halides by excited -state triplet DOM 
(3DOM*).95  
Also, in atmospheric research, sinks of DMS have been studied, both in the aqueous phase and in the 
gas phase.180, 181 Reactive halogen species (RHS) play an important role in DMS degradation via gas -
phase reactions,181, 182 while O 3 is reported to be a major sink for DMS in aqueous -phase reactions.181, 
183-185 A further link between DMS and halogen species is created by the suppression of halogen 
activation in the aqueous phase of sea spray aerosols by O 3, because the reaction bet ween DMS and 
O3 competes with the reaction between O 3 and Br-.186 By contrast, DMS has been suggested to facilitate 
halogen activation , because its oxidation in the atmosphere leads to methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and 
sulfuric acid production, contributing to the acidification of sea salt aerosols,36, 187 -189 which 
subsequently leads to production of volatile inorganic bromine species36 (Figure 2.1). At low pH, the 
production of these reactive halogen species (e.g., Br 2) is favored, because the equilibrium between 
HOBr and Br 2 is shifted toward Br 2 (equation 2.1):  
HOBr + H+ + Br-          Br2 + H 2O  K = 1.64 ×108 M-2   (2.1)36 
Another link between DMS and halogen -containing compounds was described by Toumi (1994),182 who 
postulated th at the reaction of DMS with BrO● supports recycling of Br●, which enhances O 3 
destruction (Figure 2.1). The latter process also leads to DMS oxidation, emphasizing the high 
relevance of halogen -containing compounds in atmospheric DMS oxidation.181, 182 Furthermore, in a 
modeling study, HOBr was found to contribute 8 % of global sulfate production via its reaction with 
SO 2 (S[+IV] ).190 However, similar to studies of surface waters, there are no investigations available on 
the atmospheric aqueous phase reaction between HOBr and DMS.  
In this study, we investigated the reaction between HOBr and DMS, as well as reactions between HOBr 
and D MSP and oxidation products of DMS, by performing kinetic experiments in ultrapure water and 
artificial seawater medium (ASW). Furthermore, to identify and quantify the oxidation products of 
DMS, we developed a novel high -performance liquid chromatography m ethod coupled to tandem 
mass s pectrometry (HPLC -ICP-MS/MS) to simultaneously quantify dimethyl  sulfoxide (DMSO),   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
22 
 dimethyl  sulfone (DMSO 2), methanesulfinic acid (MSIA), MSA, and sulfate (SO 42-) as well as DMS and  
DMSP. Thus, we present a preliminary quantit ative assessment of the relative importance of the 
reaction between DMS and HOBr in comparison with other known sinks for DMS.  
2.2 Materials and Methods  
2.2.1 Chemicals and reagents  
All glassware was cleaned  in a 0.5 % nitric acid (Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany)  bath for 24 hours, 
rinsed with ultrapure water and methanol (LC/MS grade, Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK), and 
dried under the fume hood before use. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS, (CH 3)2S, 99 %) and deuterated dimethyl 
sulfide (DMS -d6, (CD 3)2S, 99 at om-% D) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, USA), and from 
these 1 M stock solutions were prepared by dilution in methanol. Solutions of various concentrations 
(10-1 M, 10-3 M, and 10-5 M) were then produced in ultrapure water (18 MΩ; Thermo Fisher, Nanopure, 
Reinach, Switzerland) and used both for expe riments and as standards for GC/ MS analyses. Dimethyl  
sulfoxide (DMSO, (CH 3)2SO) and methane sulfonic acid (MSA, CH 3SO 3H) were obtained f rom Sigma -
Aldrich ( both > 99.5% pure) and stock solutions (0.1 M) were prepared in ultrapure water and stored 
in amber glass vials at 25 oC. The DMSO concentration was verified by measuring its absorbance with 
a spectrophotometer (Varian Cary Bio 100, Vari an, Inc., Palo Alto, USA) ( λ = 215 nm; E 215 = 530 M-1 cm-

Hohenbrunn, Germany), sodium methanesulfinate (MSIA, CH 3SO 2Na, 85 %; Sigma -Aldrich, St. Louis,

> 98 %; Sigma -Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) were obtained in powder form. Stock solutions of 0.1 M (Na 2SO 3, 
DMSP, DMSO 2) and 1 g/L (ABTS) were prepared in ultra pure water and stored in amber glass vials. 
Na 2SO 3 and MSIA stock solutions were freshly prepared before each experiment, while stock solutions 
of DMSO, DMSO 2, DMSP, and ABTS were stored at 4 oC and replaced every 1 –2 weeks. Stock solutions 
of hypobromous acid (HOBr,  0.1 M ) were produced via the reaction between sodium -hypochlorite 
(NaOCl, Sigma -Aldrich, St. Louis, USA; photometrically quantified active chlorine: 13.3%) and 
potassium bromide (KBr, BioXtra, > 99.0 %; Sigma -Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), as described in Criquet et al.  
(2012)191, but with a KBr excess concentration of 10% instead of 5%. Working solutions of HOBr (0.1 –
2 mM) were freshly prepared before each experiment and acidified with diluted nitric acid (HNO 3; 
Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany ) to the targeted pH to avoid pH gradients in the reaction solution. 
Formic acid, used for HPLC -ICP-MS/MS analyses, was also obtained from Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, USA), 
while methanol was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Loughb orough, UK). Dihydrogenphosphate 
(NaH 2PO 4, > 99 -102 %; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), disodium hydrogenphosphate (Na 2HPO 4; Sigma -  Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
23 
 Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), and trisodiumphosphate (Na 3PO 4; Sigma -Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) were used for 
phosphate buffers, covering  a large pH range.  
2.2.2 Kinetic experiments and determination of second -order rate constants  
2.2.2.1 Reactions between HOBr and DMS .  
Kinetic experiments for the reaction between DMS and HOBr were performed both in ultrapure water 
and in an artificial seawater medium (ASW) containing typical concentrations of Cl- and Br- (0.55 M 
sodium chloride (NaCl), > 99.5 %; Merck) and 840 µM KBr (> 99 %; Sigma -Aldrich).6 Sodium chloride 
was recrystallized before use with a rotary evaporator ( section  2.4.1) to reduce the concentration of 
impurities (especially iodide (I-)), which may potentially react with HOBr. The ultrapure water or ASW 
was buffered using a 0.4 M phospha te buffer. The pH of the solution was measured with a pH meter 
(WTW multi 340i, SenTix 41 standard pH electrode; Xylem Analytics Germany Sales GmbH, Germany)  
after each experiment and did not deviate more than 0.05 units from the target pH. Phosphate ions 
Na+ and Cl- were the main contributors to the ionic strength ( I) of the medium. Ionic strength was 
calculated based on the individual ion concentration ( section  2.4.2; Table S 2.1) and associated pKa 
values of the HOBr/OBr- and HSO 3-/SO 32- couples were dete rmined ( section  2.4.2; Table S 2.2). 
Experiments were carried out in 10 mL gastight headspace vials equipped with silicon/PTFE septa, 
under magnetic stirring, and at various pH values: 8 (present -day ocean pH), 7.5 (projected future 
ocean pH at high latitud es in 2100),192 as well as pH 8.5 and 11, to calculate species -specific second -
order rate constants for the reactions between HOBr and DMS. Experiments were performed via 
competition kinetics using sulfite as a competitor, as its reactivity with HOBr/OBr- is known11 (section 
2.4.3). The reaction was initiated by injecting 5 mL of a HOBr solution (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25 
mM) into 5 mL of a solution containing the phosphate buffer, DMS, and sulfite at 200, 1, and 1 mM, 
respectively (methanol content: 24.8 mM). The addition of a large volume of HOBr was found to 
improve the reproducibility of the data by improving the mixing con ditions. A drawback is that the 
associated larger initial headspace volume may lead to a larger initial volatilization of DMS, with 
subsequent backdiffusion to the liquid phase. We quantified this headspace effect and its potential 
effect on DMS concentrat ion ( section  2.4.4). However, we decided not to consider a headspace 
correction for the calculation of second -order rate constants, because of small differences between 
non-corrected and corrected data ( section  2.4.4; Table S 2.3; section  2.4.5). Finally, t he rate constants 
for the reaction between HOBr and DMS were calculated based on the experimental decrease of DMS 
relative to sulfite, with the known rate constants of the reactions between HOBr/OBr- and sulfite 
(section  2.4.3,11 and section  2.4.6). 
   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic

 2.2.2.2 Kinetics of the reactions of HOBr with DMSP and the oxidation products of DMS .  
The kinetics of the reactions between HOBr and DMSP and the oxidation products of DMS (DMSO, 
DMSO 2, and MSA) were investigated in a 250 mL custom -made glass bottle equipped with a dispenser 
(Labo -Tech J. Stofer LTS AG, Muttenz, Switzerland) in 50 mM phosphate buffer solution at pH 8. F or 
DMSO, its reaction with HOBr was also studied at pH 7 and 9 in ultrapure water and in ASW at pH 8. 
Because of a catalyzing effect of the phosphate buffer ( section  2.4.7), the reaction kinetics were 
investigated at different phosphate buffer concentratio ns of 0 –50 mM PO 4 tot. 
Kinetics were investigated under pseudo first -order condition by measuring the decrease of HOBr (50 
µM) in the presence of a  10-fold molar excess of the substrate ([S] = 500 -2000 µM). The 
concentration of HOBr was determined by ABT S, and the resulting ABTS●+ was quantified 
spectrophotometrically at 405 nm (molar absorption coefficient: 31600 M-1 cm-1).193  
2.2.3 Analysis of DMS and sulfite  
Dimethyl sulfide was quantified using direct -immersion solid -phase microextraction (DI -SPME), 
coupled with capillary gas chromatography –mass spectrometry (GC/MS), by a slightly modified 
method from Vriens et al.  (2015)102, as explained in section  2.4.8. Before analyses, samples were 
diluted to match the instrument linear range and d euterated DMS was added. A detection limit (DL) of 
0.6 nM was obtained for DMS, which is in accordance with the previously reported detection limit of 
30 ng L-1 DMS.102 The limit of quantification was calculated to be 2.2 nM.  
Sulfite concentrations were quantified spectrophotometrically (Merck Millipore, 12.5 –750 µM S 
Spectroquant®). The absorbance was measured at 405 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette (10 mm thickness, 
100-QS, quartz glass; Hellma Analytics, Suprasil, Müllheim, Germany) using a UV -vis 
spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100 Bio; Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, USA), w hich was calibrated daily with 
standard sulfite solutions. Repeated measurements (n = 10) of a 10 µM standard solution resulted in 
a relative standard deviation of 2.5 %. Analyses of samples were always performed at concentrations 
> 50 µM.  
2.2.4 Analyses of S-containing oxidation products  
To investigate the products of the reactions between the S -containing compounds and HOBr, we 
performed batch experiments in 10 mL gastight headspace vials, under similar conditions to those 
described above  but at variable  molar ratios of HOBr:target compounds, i.e., 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 
10. The initial concentration of these target compounds was always 10-4 M, and experiments were 
carried out in the dark for 48 –72 hours to reach completion of the reaction. Thereafte r, the samples 
were diluted to 5 µM, transferred to crimped amber HPLC vials, and analyzed within a week, with the 
HPLC -ICP-MS/MS method indicated below.    Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
25 
 To identify and quantify these S compounds, we  developed a new HPLC -ICP-MS/MS method using a 
mixed -mod e column (Thermo Fisher Scientific Hypercarb, 100 x 4.6 mm, 5 µm with the appropriate 
guard column) and a gradient elution with formic acid. The setup consisted of a binary solvent pump 
(1200 series; Agilent Technologies) coupled via a regular PEEK tubing to a triple quadrupole ICP -MS 
instrument (ICP -MS 8900; Agilent Technologies) operated in tandem mode with a mixture of O 2 and H 2 
as the reaction gas. Instrumental  parameters are provided in section  2.4.9.3, Table S2.6 . The 
instrument was tuned daily before  analysis with a multi -element solution. A solution containing Sc and 
Y (1 ppm and 50 ppb, respectively) was continuously supplied post -column through a T -piece to 
monitor its sensitivity during analysis. Elemental measurements were made in mass shift mode  for S 
and Y (m/z 32 to 48 and 89 to 105, respectively) but on mass for Sc (m/z 45 to 45). Data evaluation was 
performed with the Masshunter software (Agilent). Detection limits for sulfate were calculated using 
blank peaks areas, while DLs for other compo unds were calculated based on baseline signal variation 
(slopes based on peak height vs concentration), as no peaks were present in the blanks.  
2.3 Results and Discussion  
2.3.1 Second -order rate constants for the reaction between DMS and HOBr  
The apparent and species -specific second -order rate constants for the reactions between DMS and 
other S -containing compounds and HOBr in ultrapure water are presented in Table 2.1. The apparent 
second -order rate constant for the reaction between DMS and HOBr ( k’’app, HOBr+DMS ) is (1.1±0.2)  109 
M-1 s-1 at pH 8, indicating a very high reactivity, close to diffusion control, between DMS and HOBr. A 
similar value ( 1.2±0.2)  109 M-1 s-1 was obtained for experiments performed in A SW medium ( section  
2.4.6; Table S 2.4), ind icating that secondary bromine species (i.e., BrCl, Br 2) do not compete with the 
HOBr -DMS reaction ( section  2.4.10). The reactivity was considerably lower at pH 11 compared to pH 
7.5, 8, and 8.5, as expected from the higher reactivity of HOBr compared to OBr-, which dominates 
under these conditions.16 The calculated species -specific second -order rate constants for the reactions 
of DMS with HOBr and OBr- are (1.6±0.9)  109 M-1 s-1 and (8.0± 0.6)  107 M-1 s-1, respectively ( section  
2.4.6; Table S 2.4).  
The reaction between HOCl and DMS was previously studied. Although HOBr is generally a more 
reactive compound than HOCl,16 Ame ls et al. (1997)101 reported a higher species -specific second -order 
rate constant of 2.6   109 M-1 s-1 for the reaction between HOCl and DMS compared to the HOBr -DMS 
reaction. Also, for amino acids containing sulfhydryl (e.g. cysteine) or thioe ther (e.g. methionine) 
groups, larger second -order rate constants for reactions with HOCl compared to HOBr were 
reported.99, 194, 195 However, in seawater it is likely that the reaction between DMS and HOCl is much 
less important compared to the reaction between DMS and HOBr, for three reasons: (i) The apparent   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
26 
 second -order rate constant of the HOCl -DMS reaction is lower at pH 8 (6.2   108 M-1 s-1) compared to 
the HOBr -DMS reaction (1.2   109 M-1 s-1), (ii) HOCl is rapidly transformed to HOBr via reaction with Br- 
(Br- is an equally strong sink for HOCl as for DMS),8, 196, 197   and (iii) HOCl production is likely much lower 
than for HOBr: biological production of HOCl is only possible via the scarce chloroperoxidase enzymes, 
but not via the widespread bromopero xidase, whereas HOBr can be produced by both enzymes.198 
Moreover, the abiotic formation of HOCl through the oxidation of Cl- by O 3 is negligible because of the 
very low second -order rate constant of this reaction.185, 199 In contrast, O3 reacts moderately fast  with 
Br- (k = 160 M-1 s-1)7, representing an abiotic source of HOBr in addition to its biogenic source.9 
Howev er, based on our estimates ( section  2.4.11), we conclude that for the top 1 m surface layer, 
HOBr production via oxidation of Br- by O 3 is insignificant. In summary, we suggest that in marine 
waters the reaction between HOBr and DMS is more relevant than the reaction between HOCl and 
DMS.  
2.3.2 Second -order rate constants for reactions of DMSP and DMS oxidation products with HOBr  
The second -order rate constant for the reaction HOBr with DMSO is almost 10 orders of magnitude 
lower than the reaction wi th DMS, both in ultrapure water and ASW (Table 2.1). We assume that only 
HOBr contributes to the observed reactivity and that the influence of OBr- can be neglected.16 The 
species -specific second -order rate constant for the HOBr -DMSO reaction is 0.410.09 M-1 s-1 (section  
2.4.7; Table S 2.5). The reactivity between HOBr and DMSO was found to depend line arly on the H 2PO 4- 
concentration ( section  2.4.7; Figure S 2.3), demonstrating a catalyzing effect of the phosphate buffer 
(kcat 2113 ±184 M-2 s-1; section  2.4.7; Table S 2.5). Dihydrogenphosphate may act as a H+ donor, whereby 
H+ may facilitate the departure of OH- from the weakened HO -Br bond200 (equation 2.4). In marine 
waters, phosphates are present in the nanomolar range,201, 202 with locally higher concentrations in the 
low-micromolar range, such as in the Southern Ocean203, 204 or subarctic re gions.205 This means t hat the 
catalyzing effect of H 2PO 4- is negligible, since the product of k cat and [PO 4] is much lower compared to 
the uncatalyzed second -order rate constant. Therefore, the second -order rate constant for the 
reaction between HOBr and DMSO is determined by extrapolation to [H 2PO 4-] = 0 mM, which is the Y -
axis intercept in Figure S2.3  (section 2.4.7), representing the non -catalyzed rate constant. The second -
order rate constant for the reaction between DMSO and HOBr in ASW was approximately 50% lower 
than in u ltrapure water, probably owing to a decrease of the pK a of H 2PO 4- and HOBr. Concentrations 
of both H 2PO 4- and HOBr are lower at higher ionic strength, possibly leading to a decrease in the 
observed reactivity between DMSO and HOBr. Apart from HOBr, other r eactive Br -species such as 
molecular bromine (Br 2) and BrCl formed from the reaction between HOBr and Br-, and HOBr and Cl-, 
respectively, may react with DMSO. However, as we observed a decrease in reactivity at higher Cl- and 
Br- concentrations, degradati on of DMSO by BrCl and Br 2 seems unlikely . Also, the reactions of HOBr   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
27 
 with DMSP, MSA, and DMSO 2 were found to be very slow with second -order rate constants < 0.1 M-1 
s-1. This low reactivity was confirmed by the negligible decrease of DMSP, MSA, and DMSO 2 in the 
presence of a 10 -fold excess of HOBr over 72 hours (see below in section 2.3.4 : “Determination of 
sulfur oxidation products”). Therefore, we suggest that HOBr influences the fate of DMS but has only 
a minor direct effect on the fate of its oxidatio n products, as well as on DMSP.

2.3.3 Mechanisms of the reactions of DMS and DMSO with HOBr  
The second -order rate constant for the reaction between DMS and HOBr is between two to three 
orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding rate constants for amino acids containing 
sulfhydryl and thioether groups.99,100 Interestingly, O 3 also exhibits an equivalent enhanced reactivity 
toward DMS relative to other thioethers.183 We suggest that the reaction between DMS and HOBr 
proceeds similarly to the  HOBr/HOCl reaction with sulfite,11 i.e., via a nucleophilic attack of the lone 
electron pair of the S atom on Brδ+ of HOBr. It implies the formation of a DMSBr+ intermediate 
(equation 2 .2), followed by hydrolysis resulting in the formation of DMSO and Br- (equation 2.3):

In contrast to DMS, DMSO possesses a polarized S –O bond [(CH 3)2S+–O-], resulting in a significantly 
lower electron density at the S atom. Therefore, the nucleophilic -electrophilic interaction is less 
favorable, which likely explain s the significantly lower reactivity:

2.3.4 Determination of sulfur oxidation products  
2.3.4.1 Development of HPLC -ICP-MS/MS method and analytical performance .  
The best separation of the seven tested compounds was achieved with gradient conditions using 
formic acid and water (Eluent A: 240 mM FA + 1 % MeOH, pH 2.1; Eluent B: H 2O), starting at 10 % A 
(held for 1.5 min) and then increasing linearly within 4 minutes to 100 % A (held for 3 min) before 
retu rning  to the initial conditions ( section  2.4.9.1; Figure S 2.4). A typical chromatogram for a 5 µM 
standards (maximum concentration injected) is presented in section  2.4.9.2; Figure S 2.5. Overall, the 
peak shapes were good and compounds were baseline separated, except for DMSO and DMSO 2, which 
slightly overlap at higher concentrations. For an equal S concentration, the DMS peak is larger than the 
others, owing to its volatile nature, which makes its nebulization and transport across the spray 
chamber m ore efficient. By contrast, MSIA was not detected in any of the experiments  and we found 
that its standard is unstable and oxidized quickly to MSA. Therefore, we removed it from the mix of 
standards to not jeopardize the MSA calibrations.  
The average dete ction limits (DLs) calculated  for three different measurement sessions are 18.0 ±8.5 
nM for DMSP, 13.8 ±7.1 nM for DMSO, 14.9 ±7.4 nM for DMSO 2, 1.7 ±1.0 nM for DMS, and 32.2 ±20.3 
nM for MSA. The DL is higher for MSIA (136.1 ±47.1 nM), owin g to its degradation (section  2.4.12; Table 
S2.11). For sulfate, the DL is in the low micromolar range (4.1 ±2.7 µM), given the higher background 
concentration of sulfate in ultrapure water.  
Overall, the new HPLC -ICP-MS/MS method provides similar DLs as state of the art GC/MS a nd LC/MS -
based methods reported previously. However, the advantage of the new method is that all target 
compounds can be analyzed in a single run and without any preconcentration or pretreatment steps.

 2.3.4.2 Identification of the oxidation products.   
In batch experiments, DMSO was the main oxidation product of the reaction between HOBr and DMS 
up to a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 (Figure 2.2A). Only when HOBr was added in excess a further 
oxidation  of DMSO was observed, with DMSO 2 as the main product as  well as the formation of small 
concentrations of MSA (Figure 2.2B; section  2.4.13; Figures S 2.7 and  S2.8). An increasing fraction of 
MSA (up to 5 %) was found, especially when using HOBr in excess relative to the sulfur species 
(HOBr:DMS  2 or HOBr:DMSO  1). Oxidation experiments with DMSO 2 resulted also in the formation 
of small concentrations of MSA (< 5 %), which may be an indication that a small fraction of DMSO 2 was 
transformed to MSA (data not shown). However, concentration of DMSO 2, as well as MSA and DMSP, 
did not decrease also when HOBr was used in excess concentration (data not shown), pointing to the 
stability of these S -compounds toward HOBr and suggesting that it was rather an impurity of the S -
compound that was oxidized by HO Br. Previous studies on aqueous -phase oxidation of DMS and 
DMSO, using H 2O2, O 3, HOCl, HSO 5-, and •OH, also reported DMSO 2101, 141 -144 or MSA149,206 as final  
oxidation products with insignificant formations of sulfate. Bardouki e t al. (2002)149 and Milne et al . 
(1989)206 found that the oxidation of DMSO by •OH results in the formation of methanesulfinic acid 
(MSIA), an intermediate, which is rapidly oxidized to MSA. We did no t detect MSIA in our samples; 
however, potentially it was formed but then quickly oxidized to MSA by HOBr.   
In the atmosphere, DMS can be oxidized both via gas -phase and aqueous reactions. Gas -phase 
reactions lead preferentially to sulfate formation, while the aqueous -phase reaction pathway results 
in DMSO and subsequent MSA formation.181 The potentially relevant aqueous -phase reaction between 
DMS and HOBr may also compete with DMS oxidation processes in the gas phase, which would shift 
the ratio of gas phase and aqueous phase reaction products of DMS toward more aqueous -phase 
reaction products (i.e., DMSO and MSA), counteracting the formation of sulfate. Further studies are 
required to investigate the role of HOBr in atmospheric DMS oxidation and its impact on the ratio 
between sulfate and MSA.

HOBr:DMS or HOBr:DMSO ratios, respectively (indicated on the x -axis). Note that the HOBr:S = 0 refers 
to the DMS and DMSO blank. The S products were analyzed by HPLC -ICP-MS/MS. The initial 
concentrations of S -containing compounds in reaction experiments were 100 µM. Experiments were 
performed in amber gastight vials for 48 hours at pH 8 with a phosphate buffer concentration of 200 
and 50 mM for the DMS -HOBr or DMS O-HOBr reactions, respectively (same buffer concentration as 
used in kinetic experiments). Data were obtained from three different experiments (3 replicates).  
2.3.5 Environmental implications  
2.3.5.1 DMS as a sink for marine HOBr.   
We demonstrated that the  reaction between DMS and HOBr is fast and that it thus may be a sink for 
marine HOBr. Therefore, the HOBr consumption by DMS needs to be compared to other HOBr 
reactions, e.g., with DOM or I-. We thus compared the kinetics of the reactions of HOBr with DO M, 020406080100

 DMS, and I-. HOBr reacts with DOM to volatile18 and non -volatile207 Br-organic compounds. However, 
based on the high rates of the HOBr - I-11 and HOBr -DMS reactions, and reported marine I-208 and DMS 
concentrations,209 I- and DMS may represent a larger sink for HOBr than DOM. Indeed, calculated first -
order rate consta nts of the relevant reactions, i.e., the product of the second -order rate constant and 
the concentration of the target moieties (Table 2.2), show that DMS is a more important sink for 
marine HOBr than DOM, assuming that IHSS Pony Lake fulvic acid  (PLFA) is  a good proxy for marine 
HOBr -reactive DOM174 thanks to its low aromaticity (Table 2.2). However, DMS is likely not as 
important in consuming HOBr as I-, which seems to be the dominant sink for HOBr because of its high 
second -order rate constant for the reaction with HOBr ( k = 5  109 M-1 s-1)11 and its relatively high 
seawater concentration of approximately 100 nM (median: 77 nM).208 However, I- concentrations are 
spatially variable, with a reported range between 1 and 700 nM.208 Interestingly, a decrease in I- 
concentration was reported from low to high latitudes,208 whereas the concentration pattern of DMS 
is the opposite, with high concentrations at high latitudes.210 Therefore, we expect an above -average 
DMS/I- concentration ratio in polar regions such as the Southern Ocean .208, 210 We quantified sinks for 
HOBr based on two different DMS:I- ratios: (i) A regime represent ing global average concentrations 
(DMS = 2.5 nM; I- = 77 nM) and (ii) a high DMS/low I- regime (DMS = I- = 10 nM). As the first -order rate 
constants show (Table 2.2), DMS is expected to be an insignificant sink for HOBr compared to I- with 
respect to average DMS/I- concentrations. However, DMS becomes more important in consuming 
HOBr for the high DMS/low I- regime, where DMS may account for more than 20% HOBr consumption  
(Table 2.2). Therefore, regionally, DMS may influence the formati on of bromoform and other 
brominated volatile organic compounds formed via reactions between HOBr and DOM. In this context, 
it is interesting to note that HOBr and DMS have been shown to be produced by the same algal species 
(e.g., for the ice diatom speci es Nitzschia frigida  211,212), and therefore reactions between both 
compounds seems likely. However, this hypothesis  needs to be further tested. Furthermore, it has 
been reported that DMSP production,213, 214 DMS production,79, 215 DMS concentration82, and 
brominating activity15, 29, 30, 216 (which is directly related to HOBr production) correlate with solar 
irradiance, implying that a co -production of DMS and HOBr may exist under the same environmental 
conditions, with subsequent favorable reaction conditions between DMS and HOBr.

 Table 2.2: Second -order rate constants ( k’’) for reactions constituting HOBr sinks  at pH 8*  
*The substrate concentrations (c(S))  for I-, DOM, and DMS, which are used to calculate first -order rate constants 
(k’) of these compounds for their reaction with HOBr, are indicated. The relative importance of these HOBr sinks 
to consume HOBr is given by their fraction ( f(S)). A regime repre senting global average concentrations (left half 
of the table) and a high DMS/low I- regime (right half of the table) is illustrated. The first -order rate constants ( k’) 
are calculated by multiplying the second -order rate constants ( k’’) by the substrate c oncentration [S], i.e., 
concentration of DMS, DOM, or I-. Second -order rate constants represent apparent rate constants at pH 8. For 
the HOBr -DOM reaction, a fast initial reaction (with phenolic moieties ) and a slower continuing reaction were 
considered. R eactivity between phenolic moietie s and HOBr were expressed via the second -order rate constant 
for the reaction between phenol/phenolate and HOBr (Acero et al., (2005)98. Concentrations of phenolic moieties  
in seawater are based on PLFA (derived from Liu e t al., 2018)32 to represent the fast initial reaction between 
DOM and HOBr. For the second -stage reaction (slow continuous reaction) between HOBr and DOM, a second -
order rate constant of 15 M-1 s-1 was assumed,80 which is typical for low -aromatic DOM. Refe rences: a11; b217, 218;

2.3.5.2 HOBr as sink for marine DMS .  
The reaction of DMS with HOBr may be an additional and yet unknown sink for marine DMS. However, 
owing to the high reactivity of HOBr, its concentration in marine waters cannot be measured. 
Therefore, to make a first assessment of the importance of HOBr as sink for marine DMS, we estimate 
the HOBr steady state con centration based on reported HOBr production by macroalgae (e.g., 
seaweeds) and microalgae (e.g., diatoms)9, and the reactions of HOBr with its main sinks (i.e.,  I-) 
(section  2.4.14).  For the seaweed A. nodosum , a flux of 68 nmol HOBr per gram fresh weight algae per 
hour (68 nmol g-1 FW h-1) was reported by Wever et al . (1991).15  Hill and Manley (2009)10 reported a 
HOBr release rate of 0.6 –180 fmol cell-1 h-1 for marine diatoms. In combination with data on global 
biomass stock of macroalgae, green algae and red algae (total 2.8 ×1014 g)22, and diatom cell 
concentrations in seawater (average 263,099 cells L-1),220 we estimated that the global biological HOBr 
production ranges from 5.9 ×10-14 mol L-1 s-1 to 1.3 ×10-11 mol L-1s-1 (section 2.4.14). As a compar ison, we 
also used chlorophyll -based HOBr fluxes from diatoms in the study of Hill and Manley (2009),10 to 
approxim ate global biological HOBr production, resulting in a smaller range but same order of 
magnitude ( 1.5×10-13 – 6.5×10-12 mol HOBr L-1 s-1). Based on the estimate of the full range, i.e., 5.9 ×10-Global average ([DMS]= 2.5 nM ; [I-]= 77 nM)  High DMS/low iodide regime ([DMS]=[I-]= 10 nM)

 14 – 1.3×10-11 mol L-1 s-1, calculated HOBr steady -state concentrations range from 1.2 ×10-16 M to 2.6 ×10-
14 M, corresponding to first -order rate constants ranging from 1.9   10-7 s-1 to 4.2   10-5 s-1 for the 
reaction between HOBr and DMS. These values are in the same order of magnitude as reported DMS 
consumption rates by known sinks, i.e., photochemical oxidation, bacterial consumption, and air –sea 
gas exchange (Table 2.3). This implies that the reac tion between DMS and HOBr may be a sink for 
marine DMS and should be considered in marine S models. We also estimated the influence of O 3 to 
degrade marine DMS, as O 3 was reported to be the main sink for DMS in aqueous phase reactions in 
the atmosphere.181 However, thanks to the fast reaction of O 3 with I- and missing production  processes 
in the seawater column, the reacto -diffusive length of O 3 in seawater  is only a few micrometers 
(section  2.4.11). Therefore, marine DMS decomposition via its reaction with O 3 is only relevant for the 
top surface micrometer, but not for a surface water column of ≥ 1 m.  
To test the plausibility of the above described HOBr concentration assessment, a second independent 
approach was adopted to estimate HOBr steady -state concentra tions. As HOBr is the main active 
bromine species involved in the production of CHBr 3,9, 10, 18, 20, 24 its steady -state concentration may be 
estimated based on a CHBr 3 flux model (section 2.4. 15). In this model, we assume that the global 
marine production of CHBr 3 via reaction between HOBr and DOM, has to be equal to the global marine 
CHBr 3 loss, which is dominated by air –sea gas exchange.24 We consider CHBr 3 production as a chemical 
production flux from the HOBr -DOM reaction, taking PLFA as a proxy for marine DOM. It depends on 
the DOM conce ntration, the fraction of phenolic moietie s of DOM, the fraction of CHBr 3 formation 
from reacted HOBr, the kinetics of CHBr 3 formation, and the HOBr concentration. As all these 
parameters are well documented in the literature,19, 174, 219 with the exception of the HOBr 
concentration, we can model the CHBr 3 formation as a function of the HOBr concentration and 
determine HOBr steady -state concentrations for balanced CHBr 3 fluxes. By this approach, we 
calculated HOBr steady -state concentrations ranging between 8.3 ×10-15 M and 4.2 ×10-14 M (average: 
3.1×10-14 M), which is in the same range as the estimated HOBr concentrations based on HOBr 
production and sink fluxes.

 *Values in brackets denote DMS turnover rate in a water column of 10–100 m (relevant for reported 
photochemical oxidation rates). The high photochemical oxidation rates indicated by an asterisk do not reflect 
environmentally relevant conditions, as either the applied irradiation or the concentration of chemical 
compounds  (e.g., nitrate) is higher than in ambient marine conditions.  
As stated above, favorable reaction conditions between DMS and HOBr may exist at high latitudes 
because of low I- concentrations, high HOBr production fluxes, and high DMS concentrations. 
Therefore, we speculate that HOBr may be an important sink for DMS in these regions, as less HOBr is 
consumed by I- and, therefore, more HOBr is available to degrade DMS. Although t he low I- 
concentrations could be a result of I- turnover via the HOBr -I- reaction, it is unlikely that HOBr is an 
important sink for I- (in contrast to I- for HOBr), owing to the higher I- concentration than HOBr in 
marine waters.  It should also be consid ered that the reaction product of the HOBr - I- reaction (i.e., 
hypoiodous acid, HOI) and further reactive species emerging from reactions with HOI (e.g. IBr, ICl) are 
also able to degrade DMS. However, the relevance of such species in terms of marine DMS d egradation 
has not yet been examined.  
Apart from the likely relevance of the reaction between HOBr and DMS in marine waters, this reaction 
could also play a role in aqueous -phase atmospheric chemistry, as HOBr was reported to be present in 
relatively high concentrations (approximately 10-8 M) in aerosols.229 Hypobromous acid may contribute Biological

 to aqueous DMSO formation in the atmosphere and thereby indirectly facilitate the formation of MSA 
via the aqueous -phase reactions of DMSO with hydroxyl radical and MSIA with o zone.181  
To date, the role of halogen compounds in atmospheric DMS degrad ation has been mainly studied for 
gas-phase reactions, e.g., via the DMS -BrO. reaction.181 However, if concentrations of HOBr in aerosols 
are substantial, aqueou s phase DMS degradation via the HOBr -DMS reaction could take place and 
contribute to overall atmospheric DMS degradation caused by halogen -derived oxidants. Further 
studies under relevant atmospheric conditions are required to assess the importance of the aqueous 
phase reaction between DMS and HOBr in the atmosphere.  
2.4 Supporting Information  
2.4.1. Recrystallization of NaCl  
Sodium chloride (NaCl; Merck, analytical grade, > 99.5 %) used for kinetic experiments was 
recrystallized before use to minimize reactions of HOBr with potential impurities. 800 mL of a 98 % 
saturated (= 350 g/L) NaCl solution was produced and recrystalliz ed with a rotary evaporator (Büchi, 
Rotavapor R -124) for several hours under low pressure conditions (120 mbar). The recrystallized NaCl 
was filtered with a vacuum -filtration unit and dried in an oven at 50 °C.  
2.4.2 Calculation of ionic strength and of p Ka values  
2.4.2.1 Calculation of ionic strength.  
The ionic strength ( I) in our experiments does not always correspond to the ionic strength for which 
pKa values were reported. Therefore, the p Ka value of the HOBr/OBr- and HSO 3-/SO 32- equilibria were 
corrected for the actual ionic strengths of the experiments. In Table S 2.1 the lower and upper range of 
ionic strength is calculated for the DMS -HOBr and DMSO -HOBr experiments, as a function of the pH. 
Calculation of ionic strengths values  are based on equation S 2.1.230  
I(NaCl, PO4 buffer)  = 0.5 × Σci × z i2 =  
0.5 × (c(Na+) × 12 + c(Cl-) × 12 + c(H 2PO 4-) × 12 + c(HPO 42-) × 22 + c(PO 43-) × 32) (S2.1)

For experiments performe d in ultrapure water, the ionic strength is mainly controlled by the 
phosphate buffer. Higher phosphate buffer concentrations in the DMS -HOBr experiments (PO 4 tot = 0.2 
M) result in a higher ionic strength compared to the DMSO -HOBr experiments (PO 4 tot = 0.01 - 0.05 M) 
(Table S 2.1). The slight increase in ionic strength with higher pH is a result of the speciation change of 
the phos phate buffer. For the DMSO -HOBr experiments the difference between minimum and 
maximum ionic strength values is based on the used phosphate buffer concentration (10 mM vs 50 
mM PO 4tot). The small difference of the minimum and maximum ioni c strength for a single pH value for 
the DMS -HOBr experiments is based on the different concentration of HOBr added to the reaction vial.  
The ionic strengths of the DMS -HOBr and DMSO -HOBr experiments increases to around 1.1 M and 0.6 
M, respectively, for the ASW (0.55 M NaCl; 840 µM KBr).  
2.4.2.2 Determination of pKa v alues.  
For the HOBr/OBr- equilibrium, a p Ka value of 8.8 was reported by Troy & Margerum (1991) for an 
ionic strength of I = 0.5 M.11 Haag and Hoigné (1983) reported a value of 8.76 for I = 0.02 -0.15 M.7 
Gerritsen et al. (1993) reported a p Ka value of 8.59 for I = 1.0 M.231 
Tartar & Garretson (1941) investigated the p K2 (HSO 3-/SO 32- equilibrium) value as a functio n of ionic 
strength.232 Based on their results, a linear least square fit was derived, by which the correct p Ka value 
can be allocated to the individual ionic strength:  
pKa (HSO 3-/SO 32-) = -0.5024 × I1/2 + 7.2       (S2.2)   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
38 
 Based on this information, the p Ka values were determined for our experimental conditions (Table 
S2.2). For our experiments, the p Ka (HOBr/OBr-) value from Troy & Margerum (1991)11 (pKa = 8.8) was 
selected because of similar ionic strength ( I ≈ 0.5 M). Only for the DMS -HOBr experiments pe rformed 
in salt medium ( I ≈ 1 M), the lower value of of 8.59 of Gerritsen et al. (1993)231 was selected. For p Ka 
(HSO 3-/SO 32-) a value of 6.85 was derived for the ultrapure water experiments, based on an ionic 
strength of  I ≈ 0.5 M. A value of 6.7 was derived for the DMS -HOBr experiments performed in artificial 
seawater medium (ASW; consisting of 0.55 M NaCl and 840 µM KBr) ( I ≈ 1M).

2.4.3  Kinetics of the reaction between sulfite and HOBr/OBr- and derivation of second -order rate 
constants for the reaction between DMS and HOBr/OBr-  
The second -order rate constants of the reactions between HOBr/OBr- and sulfite (equations S 2.3 and 
S2.4) have been determined previously11: 
SO 32- + HOBr   5  109 M-1 s-1      (S2.3) 
SO 32- + OBr-  1  108 M-1 s-1      (S2.4) 
The reactivity between sulfite and HOBr is pH -dependent, the p Ka values of HOBr/OBr- and HSO 3-/SO 32- 
for ultrapure water and the ASW medium are presented in Table S 2.2. HSO 3- reactivity towards   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic

 HOBr/OBr- is neglected, because of the low nucleophility of HS O3- compared to SO 32- and the 
consequently lower reactivity towards HOBr/OBr-.233 
The apparent second -order rate constant for the reaction between sulfite and HOBr/OBr- can be 
expressed by equation S 2.5 and is illustrated in Figure S 2.1: 
k’’app,sulfite+HOBr  = k’’sulfite+HOBr   αHOBr + k’’sulfite+OBr-  (1-αHOBr)   (S2.5) 
where  
αHOBr is the degree of dissociation (i.e. the protonated fraction of HOBr/OBr-).  
k’’sulfite+HOBr  is the second -order rate constant of the HOBr -sulfite reaction ( 5  109 M-1 s-1) 
k’’sulfite+OBr- is the second -order rate constant of the OBr--sulfite reaction ( 1  108 M-1 s-1)

 Multiplication of this slope with the apparent second -order rate constant for the reaction between 
sulfite and HOBr gives the apparent second -order rate constant ( k‘‘app,DMS+HOBr ) of the reaction between 
DMS and HOBr:  
k‘‘app,DMS+HOBr  = slope × kapp,SO32 -+HOBr       (S2.8) 
The species -specific rate constants ( k’’DMS+HOBr , k’’DMS+OBr-) are related to the apparent rate constant as 
follows:  
k’’app,DMS+HOBr  = k’’DMS+HOBr  × αHOBr + k’’DMS+OBr- × (1-αHOBr)    (S2.9) 
where  
αHOBr is the degree of dissociation (i.e. the protonated fraction of HOBr/OBr-) 
We used equation S 2.9 for two different pH values in order to determine both k’’DMS+HOBr  and 
k’’DMS+OBr-.

As a comparison to the average slope values originating from the single kinetic experiments (Table 
S2.3), we also compiled all data points from different experiments in one plot and determined the 
slopes for each pH (Figure S 2.2). Both approaches are in good agreement with the average slope values 
indicated in Table S 2.3 and can be interpreted as a confirmation of those values.    Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic

 2.4.6  Calculation of second -order rate constants for the DMS -HOBr/OBr- reactions  
With the slope values indicated in Table S 2.3 (uncorrected slope values) a nd procedure explained in 
section  2.4.3, apparent second -order rate constants of the DMS+HOBr reaction ( k’’app, DMS+HOBr ) are 
calculated based on the multiplication of the apparent second -order rate constants of the sulfite+HOBr 
reaction ( k’’app, sulfite+HOBr ) and the slope value. Species -specific second -order rate constants ( k’’DMS+HOBr 
and k’’DMS+OBr-) were determined based on the calculated k’’app, DMS+HOBr values for pairs of pH values (pH  
8 & 11, pH 8 & 8.5, pH 8.5 & 11). Both apparent and species -specific second -order rate constants are 
indicated in Table S 2.4. and species -specific rate constants of the reaction between HOBr and DMS can 
be calculated.  
The apparent second -order rate const ant of the reaction between DMS and HOBr/OBr- in ASW has a 
value of (1.2±0.2)   109 M-1 s-1 at pH 8 and is very close to the value obtained in ultrapure water 
(1.1±0.2)   109 M-1 s-1, Table S 2.4). Due to the slightly different HOBr/OBr- speciation as a result of the 
higher ionic strength (i.e. less HOBr, more OBr-), k’’DMS+HOBr  is calculated to be slightly higher and 
k’’DMS+OBr - slightly lower, but the difference is not significant with respect to the obtained standard 
deviations.  
Table S2.4: Apparent and species -specific second -order rate constants for the reactions between 
HOBr/OBr- and DMS in ultrapure water. Also, the apparent second -order rate constant at pH 8 is 
indicated for seawater conditions (ASW). Species -specific and apparent second -order rate constant of 
the DMS -HOBr reaction are also shown in Table 2.1 in the manuscript.

2.4.7  Phosphate catalysis of the DMSO -HOBr reaction  
During the experimental study of the DMSO -HOBr reaction, it was observed that the apparent rate 
constant increased with increasing phosphate buffer concentration. It was hypothesized that H 2PO 4- 
might act as a catalyst for the reaction as this compound is known for its proton donating ability.200   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
43 
 Therefore, consumption of HOBr is a result of both the H 2PO 4- catalyzed and non -catalyzed reaction 
between DMSO and HOBr (equation S 2.10). It is assumed that the contribution of OBr- to the reaction 
is negligible, because HOBr reacts orders of magnitudes fast er.16

𝑑𝑡  = kHOBr+DMSO, uncatalyzed  × [HOBr]  × [DMSO] + kcat × [H2PO 4-] × [HOBr]  × [DMSO]  (S2.10) 
where  
kHOBr+DMSO, uncatalyzed  is the uncatalyzed second -order rate constant  for the reaction between HOBr and 
DMSO  
kcat is the rate constant for the H 2PO 4--catalyzed reaction between HOBr and DMSO  
Equation S 2.10 can be simplified to:  
kobs = kHOBr+DMSO, uncatalyzed  + kcat × [H2PO 4-]       (S2.11) 
To study the potential catalytic effect of the phosphate buffer, the reaction between DMSO and HOBr 
was studied at different phosphate buffer concentrations for pH 7, 8 and 9. The observed second -order 
rate constants ( kobs) were then plotted against the corresponding H 2PO 4- concentrations , which is a 
function of PO 4tot and pH. A linear relationship was observed between kobs and [H 2PO 4-] for each pH 
value (Figure S 2.3).

According to equation S 2.11 and  Figure S 2.3, kcat is the slope and k1 the intercept of the linear 
correlation. Averaged over the three pH values, a value of 2113 M-2 s-1 was derived for kcat, and 0.4 M-

Table S 2.5 shows that the phosphate buffer indeed has a strong influence on DMSO -HOBr kinetics. 
From the data in Table S 2.5 it can be calculated that for H 2PO 4- concentrations higher than 194 µM 
(corresponding to a PO 4tot concentration of 1.39 mM at pH 8), the DMSO -HOBr reaction proceeds to 
a great er extent via the H 2PO 4- catalyzed reaction than the uncatalyzed reaction. In marine waters, 
where we have a negligible phosphate concentrations, DMSO -HOBr reaction is controlled by the 
uncatalyzed second -order rate constant (i.e., 0.4 M-1 s-1). To verify the obtained 0.4 M-1 s-1 from 
Figure S 2.3, we performed and experiment in unbuffered ultrapure water, and observed also a 
reaction rate of 0.4 M-1 s-1.  
2.4.8  Analysis of DMS  
Immediately after reaction, samples were diluted 1000 times (10 µl to 10 mL ultrapure water in a 
headspace vial using a 10 µl gastight syringe. To these solutions, 10 µl of a 10-3 M internal standard 
(DMS -d6) solution was added to obtain a DMS -d6 concentration of 10-6 M. The concentrations of DMS 
and DMS -d6  were then quantified u sing direct -immersion solid -phase microextraction (DI -SPME) 
coupled to capillary gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC/MS), according to the method 
described in Vriens et al. (2015).102 The GC oven temperature program was slightly modified: 40 °C for 
5 min, a ramp of 5 °C min-1 to 200°C and hold 5 min over a constant pressure of He carrier gas (100 
kPa). The obtained chromatograms were processed and integrated using the Xcalibur software 
(Thermo Scientific, Switzerland).

were separated according to Figure S 2.5. The peaks were obtained with a mixed standard solution of 
5 µM for each compound (corresponding to the largest concentration of the calibration). The large size 
of the DMS peak is likely due to the high extraction efficiency and mobility of DMS. Methanesulfinic 
acid (MSIA) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) are shown in their  deprotonated form (i.e. MSI- and MS-, 
respectively), because their pKa values are much lower than the target pH (pKa MSIA/MSI- = 2.1; pKa 
MSA/MS- = -1.9).

2.4.10  Influence of BrCl, Br 2O and Br 2 on the DMS -HOBr and DMSO -HOBr reactions  
Apart from HOBr, other bromine species can react with DMS and DMSO. In solutions containing Br- 
and Cl- ions, Br 2 and BrCl can form via reactions with HOBr:  
HOBr + Br- + H+     Br2 + H 2O K = 1.64 ×108 M-2 234   (S2.12) 
HOBr + Cl- + H+          BrCl + H 2O K = 7692 M-2 235    (S2.13) 
Furthermore, HOBr is in equilibrium with Br 2O according to equation S 2.14: 
2 HOBr          Br2O + H 2O  K = 6.31  M-1 200    (S2.14) 
At low pH, the equilibrium of reactions S 2.12 and S 2.13 is shifted in the direction of Br 2 and BrCl, 
respectively. These species are known to react fast with several organic compounds and might 
represent a competitor to HOBr for its reaction with organic compounds, as reported in Sivey et al. 
(2013).200 Therefore, if these species would be present in sufficiently high concentrations, they may 
undergo fast reactions with organic sulfur compounds and thus influence the reaction kinetics 
investigated in this study. The concentrations of the bromine compound s mentioned above were 
calculated based on the equilibrium reactions S 2.12, S 2.13 and S 2.14, both for the performed 
laboratory experiments and the natural marine environment (Tables S 2.7 - S2.9):

Tables S 2.7 - S2.9 show that the concentrations  of BrCl, Br 2O and Br 2 are several orders of magnitude 
lower than HOBr. As the rate constant of the reaction between HOBr and DMS is near the diffusion 
limit, the role of BrCl, Br 2O and Br 2 under our experimental conditions is negligible. Also, for the nat ural 
marine environment a negligible role of BrCl, Br 2O and Br 2 is expected, because their concentrations 
relative to HOBr is the same (BrCl, Br 2) or lower (Br 2O) in the marine system compared to our 
experimental conditions.  
2.4.11  Relevance of the reactio n between O 3 and Br- for HOBr production  
To determine whether the reaction between O 3 and Br- is a relevant process for HOBr production, we 
have first to determine the O 3 concentration in seawater. Ozone diffuses from the atmosphere to the   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
49 
 seawater layer where it is consumed rapidly by its reaction with seawater components (mainly I- and 
DOM). Therefore, a sharp concentration gradient for O 3 is expected with increasing wat er depth.  
The total amount of O 3 can be estimated by multiplying the O 3 partial pressure (atm) with the Henry’s 
law constant (M atm-1) and the reacto -diffusive length (m):  
n(O3) = pO3 × HO3 × Ɩ    (S2.15) 
where  
n(O3) is the column integrated number of O 3 molecules in seawater [mol m-2] 
pO3 is the O 3 partial pressure in the air [atm]  
HO3 is the Henry’s law constant for O 3 
Ɩ is the reacto -diffusive length of O 3 in seawater  
The reacto -diffusive length is a function of the liquid diffusion constant and the first-order loss of O 3 
via chemical reactions (S 2.16) 
Ɩ = (𝐷𝐿
𝑘′ )0.5
     (S2.16) 
where  
DL is the liquid diffusion constant [m2 s-1] 
k’ is the first order consumption of O 3 in seawater [s-1] 
Iodide (I-) and DOM are the dominant sinks for O 3 in seawater and are assumed to represent the total 
O3 consumption. The second -order rate constant of the reaction between O 3 and I-  (3.6  109 M-1 s-
1)236 multiplied by the seawater I- concentration (77 nM)208 yields a first -order consumption rate for O 3 
of 277 s-1. The second -order rate constant of the reaction between O 3 and DOM (Seawater DOM, 
details not known; 4   106 M-1 s-1)236 multiplied by the seawater DOM concentration (67 µM)237 yields 
a first -order degradation rate for O 3 of 268 s-1. Thus, the overall first -order rate constant for O 3 
consumption in seawater can  be estimated as  545 s-1.  
The used values of pO3, D L, H and k’ are provided in Table S 2.10. With these values, a reacto -diffusive 
length of 2.1 µm and a column integrated O 3 quantity of 1.5 ×10-12 mol m-2 is calculated. This means 
that HOBr production via the O 3-Br- reaction is only possible in the top 2 µm of the surface layer, 
because the O 3 availability is restricted to this layer. Ozone averaged over the top 1 m yields a 
concentration of 1.5 ×10-15 M. We can now estimate HOBr production via the O 3-Br- reaction wit hin the 
top 1 m surface layer and compare it with the biological HOBr production rate estimated above:  
   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
50 
 FHOBr (O3+Br -) = k’’O3+Br - × [Br-] × [O3]  (S2.17) 
where  
k’’O3+Br - is the second -order rate constant for the O 3-Br- reaction [M-1 s-1] 
[Br-] is the bromide concentration in seawater  
[O3] is the average O 3 concentration in the top 1 m surface layer  
With k’’O3+Br - of 160 M-1 s-1,7 [Br-] = 840 µM6 and [O 3] = 1.5 ×10-15 M we obtain a HOBr producton flux of 
2.0×10-16 mol L-1 s-1, which is ca. 2 orders of magnitude lower than our low biological HOBr production 
scenario. The refore, abiotic HOBr production via the O 3-Br- reaction can be regarded as insignificant 
for the top 1 m surface layer. Its significance for marine HOBr is limited to the very top micrometers of 
the ocean.

2.4.13  Reaction stoichiometries of the reactions between DMS and HOBr and between DMSO and 
HOBr  
The oxidation experiments show that the majority of DMS is oxidized to DMSO, which in turn is mainly 
oxidized to DMSO 2 after consumption of all DMS. Here, we quantified the consumption of the S -
reactant (i.e., reacted DMS from the DMS -HOBr reaction and reacted DMSO from the DMSO -HOBr 
reaction) as a function of (i) the applied HOBr concentration, and (ii) the product forme d (i.e., DMSO 
from the DMS -HOBr reaction and DMSO 2 from the DMSO -HOBr reaction), see Figures S 2.6 and S 2.7.   
The reaction between DMS and HOBr results in an equal consumption of HOBr and DMS (Figure S 2.6) 
which is demonstrated by a slope of close to 1 (sl ope: 1.03). Dimethyl  sulfide is efficiently transformed 
to DMSO in a 1:1 stoichiometry, which is demonstrated by the equal amount of reacted DMS and 
produced DMSO (slope: 1.04). This means that there is a 1:1 stoichiometry for the HOBr -DMS reaction, 
yieldi ng 100% DMSO. The stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that the overall reaction is second - 
order: first order in HOBr and first order in DMS. The same stoichiometry is observed for the reaction 
between DMSO and HOBr (Figure S 2.7): DMSO is efficiently t ransformed to DMSO 2 in a 1:1 
stoichiometry.

2.4.14.1 Determination of the HOBr production flux . 
We assume here that HOBr production is mainly biologically driven and that abiotic bromide (Br-) 
oxidation by O 3 or HOCl is negligible (see Manuscript: “Rate constants for the DMS -HOBr reaction”).  
We provide both low and high estimates for global HOBr production based on the reported range of 
HOBr fluxes.  
To estimate the HOBr production by macroalg ae, we considered the study of Wever et al . (1991)15, 
who reported a HOBr production flux of 68 nmol (g FW)-1 h-1 for the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum . 
Unfortunately, there are no further reports giving estimates of HOBr fluxes by macroalgae and 
microalgae (e.g., green algae and red algae). Therefore, we assume that the flux reported by Wever et 
al. (1991) is also valid for macroalgae, green and red alg ae. Carpenter & Liss (2000)22 estimated a global 
biomass of macroalgae, green algae and red algae of 2 ×108 tons, 4 ×107 tons a nd 4 ×107 tons, 
respectively, which we multiplied with the HOBr flux from Wever et al.  (1991). Furthermore, we 
assume that most of the macroalgal/green algal/red algal -HOBr is produced in the top 1 m surface 
layer of biomass -rich waters where turbidity is h igh. HOBr production indirectly depends on light 
intensity and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), which will be almost completely attenuated at 1 
m depth in such algal rich waters.251 With this information we can estimate the combined HOBr 
production flux from macroalgae, green algae and red algae (eq uation  S2.18):

where

Aoc is the global area of seawater [m2]

To estimate HOBr production by diatoms we used the data from Hill & Manley (2009)10, who used an 
in situ incubation assay of marine diatoms to measure the release of reactive bromine (i.e. HOBr) and 
iodine species. This is the only paper reporting fluxes from diatoms. Lowest (0.6 fmol cell-1 h-1) and 
highest (180 fmol cell-1 h-1) reporte d fluxes were taken for low (equation S 2.19) and high (equation  
S2.20) HOBr production scenario, respectively. T he fluxes from Hill & Manley (2009) were multiplied 
with the  global average diatom cell concentration (2.6 ×105 cells L-1), given in Leblanc et al. (2012).220   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic

C is the global average diatom cell density [cells L-1] 
Based on equations S 2.18 - S2.20, we estimate a total HOBr production (i.e., HOBr production form 
macroalgae, green algae and red algae, and diatoms) in the range of 5.9 ×10-14 mol L-1 s-1 to 1.3 ×10-11 
mol L-1 s-1. The potential larger contribution of diatom s vs macroalgae to HOBr production is supported 
by two reasons: First, global diatom biomass has been estimated to range between 444 and 582 Tg C, 
exceeding reported biomass estimates for macroalgae.22 Second, bromoform, which is a major product 
of the reaction between DOM and HOBr,9 is generally emitted in higher fluxes by diatoms211, 252 than 
macroalgae.22, 253 -255   
Still, our estimation of global HOBr production (and the subsequent calculated HOBr steady -state 
concentration and first -order loss of DMS via its reaction with HOBr) is conservative because of three 
reasons: First, the species A. nodosum  shows in several studies a rather low bromoform production 
rate compared with other seaweed species.254, 256 Second, the halope roxidase enzyme and 
corresponding production of volatile halocarbons was also observed for cyanobacteria,257-259 fungi and 
marine animals , which implies that these marine organisms are also involved in the production of 
HOBr.  However, there is no quantitative information available for HOBr production by these organisms 
and their overall contribution to HOBr production cannot be established .  
2.4.14.2 Modeling of the HOBr steady state concentration by considering HOBr fluxes (production and 
sinks) .  
We modelled concentrations of HOBr as a function of time, using a simplified kinetic model in 
Kintecus260 and considering estimated H OBr production fluxes (section 2.4. 14) and reaction of HOBr 
with I- as the main sink for HOBr (Figures S 2.8 and S2.9). The corresponding mo del and species 
description are detailed in Tables S 2.12 - S2.13 and Table S 2.14, respectively. We used the HOBr 
production fluxes of 5.9 ×10-14 mol L-1 s-1 and 1.3 ×10-11 mol L-1 s-1 to obtain high and low estimates of 
modelled HOBr concentrations. HOBr consumption was considered via the second -order rate constant   Chapter 2. DMS -HOBr kinetic  
55 
 of the reaction between HOBr and I-  (5  109 M-1 s-1)11 and an I- concentration of 100 nM. A seawater 
matrix of pH 8 with [Cl-] = 0.55 M and [Br-] = 840 µM was selected, representing marine conditions.   
For the low HOBr production scenario, we calculated a HOBr steady -state concentration of 1.2 ×10-16 
M. For the high HOBr production scenario, we calculated a HOBr concentration of 2.6 ×10-14 M.

 It is assumed that CHBr 3 production takes place in the top 10 m of the water column and the calculated 
HOBr concentration thus refers to this layer. The average CHBr 3 flux to the atmosphere is determined 
based on several studies summarized in Ziska et al. (2013),23 and amounts to 785 pmol m-2 h-1). 
Furthermore, we assume that CHBr 3 is formed only by reaction of HOBr with DOM and not via other 
reactions. As a proxy for seawater DOM, Pony lake fulvic acid (PLFA) was used.174 As phenolic moietie s 
(CPhe) were reported to contribute significantly to CHBr 3 formation,174 their content in PLFA is also part 
of the model. Furthermore, the efficiency of  CHBr 3 formation ( f), expressed as CHBr 3 formation per 
reacted HOBr, has to be considered and can be expressed via the CHBr 3 production per reacted phenol 
(mol CHBr 3/mol phenol) divided by the oxidant demand (mol HOBr/mol phenol).174 The kinetics of the 
reaction between HOBr and C Phe was expressed by the second -order rate constant for th e reaction 
between tribromophenol and HOBr, because this reaction has been reported to be the rate limiting 
step in CHBr 3 production.19

concentrations ranging between  8.3 ×10-15 and 4.2 ×10-14 M (average value of 3.1 ×10-14 M) for the top 
10 m of the o cean water.

Abstract  
Recently, we suggested that hypobromous acid (HOBr) is a sink for the  marine volatile organic sulfur 
compound dimethyl sulfide (DMS). However, HOBr is also known to react with reactive moieties of 
dissolved organic matter (DOM) such as phenolic compounds to form bromoform (CHBr 3) and other 
brominated compounds. The reaction between HOBr and DMS may thus compete with the reaction 
between HOBr and DOM. To study this potential competition , kinetic batch and diffusion -reactor 
experiments with DMS, HOBr and DOM were performed. Based on reaction kinetics, we modeled 
concentrations of DMS, HOBr and CHBr 3 during typical algal bloom fluxes of DMS and HOBr (10-13 M s-
1 – 10-9 M s-1). For an intermediate to high HOBr flux (≥ 10-11 M s-1) and a DMS flux ≤ 10-11 M s-1 the 
model shows that the DMS degradation by HOBr was higher than for photochemical oxidation, Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
60 
 biological consumption and sea -air gas exc hange  combined . For HOBr fluxes ≤ 10-11 M s-1 and a DMS 
flux of 10-11 M s-1 our model shows that CHBr 3 decreases by 86% compared to a lower DMS flux of 10-
12 M s-1.  Therefore, the reaction between HOBr and DMS does likely not only present a sink for DMS 
but may also lead to suppressed CHBr 3 formation.    
3.1 Introduction  
In marine systems, hypobromous acid (HOBr) is an active form of bromine  (Br), produced via the 
enzymatic reaction between bromide (Br-) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2).9 This reaction is catalyzed 
by vanadium - bromoperoxidase enzymes (V -BrPO), which are widely distributed in marine organisms, 
such as macroalgae,175, 268 -270 microalgae10, 21, 271 and bacteria.259, 272 -274 Once produced, HOBr reacts fast 
with phenolic c ompounds (PhOH) and other reactive moieties such as -diketones of dissolved 
organic matter (DOM), to form polybrominated compounds including volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs),9, 10, 15, 16, 18, 20 of which bromoform (CHBr 3) is the most abundant chemical  species.20-22, 253, 275 
Brominated VOCs are of environmental concern, because after their release into the atmosphere they 
are photolytically decomposed to Br atoms (Br●),40, 276 which together with other reactive halogen 
species (RHS) play a key role in the chemistry and oxidizing capacity of the troposphere.277 RHS deplete 
ozone (O 3) 44, 45, 278 via efficient catalytic cycles in the troposphere and stratosphere, reduce the lifetime 
of the greenhouse gas methane ( CH 4)279 and react with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the troposphere,280 
thereby affecting climatic processes.  
Similarly to HOBr, the volatile organic sulfur (S) compound DMS is biologically produced in seawater 
and also plays a role in atmospheric chemistry and climate as it promotes the formation of aerosols 
and clouds through its oxidation to sulfate.55, 56, 59, 60 The main pathway of DMS production is via 
enzymatic cleavage of its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).165 Whereas, HOBr is assumed 
to be generally extracellularly produced, since V -BrPO  (the most common form of haloperoxidase in 
the marine environment)281 is often described to be located in the apoplast9, 10, 20, 282 , the production 
of DMS is less site -specific. While D MSP is synthesized intracellularly,165, 283, 284 its cleavage to DMS may 
occur intra285-288- or extracellularly,289-292 depending on the location of the DMSP -lyase  enzyme . 
According to Stefels et al . (2007)165 a facilitated removal of excess S and maintenance of an intracellular 
nitrogen (N) balance (overflow hypothesis) support an extracellular cleavage of DMSP to DMS  62, 
whereas the DMSP -based antioxidative system described by Sunda et al . (2002)79 would favour a n 
intracellular (e.g. chloroplastic) location of the lyase enzymes. Antioxidative properties were reported 
for DMSP and DMS79,  for example, several studies report an upreg ulation of DMSP and DMS under 
conditions of oxidative stress.78-82 In parallel, increased bromination  activity was also observed under Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
61 
 oxidative stress conditions.29, 30, 32 Amplified HOBr production is often associated with a reduction of 
H2O2 levels and thus  provides better protection of the cell against oxidative damage , similar to D MS.12 
Production of DMS and HOBr may also be motivated by defense mechanisms, as for both HOBr13 and 
DMSP lyase products74, 75 antimicrobial properties were repor ted. It is likely that both HOBr and DMS 
are produced during the same algal bloom event, e.g., high production rates of both DMS212, 293 and 
HOBr10, 30/CHBr 3211, 252 have been reported for ice algae in polar regions and the coincident production 
of DMS and  HOBr was also documented for a marine diatom species.211, 212  
We recently demonstrated a high reactivity between HOBr and DMS,294 with a second order rate 
constant of 2   109 M-1 s-1, which is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than  the reactivity of HOBr with 
phenol at pH 8.17 Based on this second order rate constant and estimated marine HOBr 
concentrations294 we previously suggested that HOBr represents a globally important, but yet 
unidentified, sink for marine DMS, of similar quantitative importance as other known DMS sinks, i.e., 
bacterial consumption, photochemical oxidation and air -sea gas exchange. Furthermore, although 
DMS is present in lower concentrations in marine waters than phenolic moieties in DOM, due to its 
high reactivity, it might compete with the reaction between marine DOM and HOBr, and c onsequently 
affect the formation of CHBr 3 and other brominated VOCs. However, the potential competition 
between DMS and the more predominant DOM moieties for their reaction with HOBr in marine waters 
has not been studied yet. In this study we investigated (i) the influence of DMS on the production of 
brominated VOCs by HOBr in the presence of DOM, and (ii) the DMS oxidation by HOBr at DMS:DOM 
ratios relevant for the marine environment . Two types of DOM extracts with low aromatic fractions 
were used as surro gates for marine DOM. Kinetic studies were carried out in batch experiments for 
relevant concentration ratios of DMS:phenolic moieties and in custom -built diffusion -reactors for 
relevant DMS flux: phenolic moieties ratios and HOBr flux: phenolic moieties rat ios. Finally, results of 
diffusion -reactor experiments were validated by a diffusion -reaction model, which was extended to 
cover a wide range of natural HOBr and DMS fluxes to study the reactions between HOBr, DMS and 
DOM for various environmentally relevant scenarios.  
3.2 Materials and Methods  
3.2.1 Production of stock solutions and standards  
Stock solutions of dimethyl sulfide (DMS, (CH 3)2S, 99%, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), hypobromous 
acid (HOBr), oxidized S compounds (i.e. dime thyl sulfoxide, DMSO, (CH 3)2SO; dimethyl sulfone, DMSO 2, 
(CH 3SO) 2; methane sulfonic acid, MSA, CH 3SO 3H; sodium sulfate, Na 2SO 4) and 2,2-azino -bis(3 -Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
62 
 ethylbenzothiazoline) -6-sulfonic acid -diammonium salt  (ABTS, C18H18N4O6S4, > 98%, Sigma -Aldrich, St. 
Louis, USA) were produced as described in Müller et al.  (2019).294 (see also Table S 3.1).  
Stock solutions of 500 mg L-1 DOM in ultrapure water were produced from the International Humic 
Substances Society’s (IHSS) “Upper Mississippi River NOM” (UMRNOM, Cat number: 1R110N; IHSS, St. 
Paul, USA) and the “Pony lake fulvic acid” (PLFA,  Cat number: 1R109F; IHSS, St. Paul, USA) and stored 
in amber glass vials after the pH was set to ca. 10295 with a sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, 32%, 
Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The NOM stock solutions were then sonicated for 2 × 10 min in an 
ultrasonic bath (Sonorex Super 10 P, Berlin, Germany), followed by a readjustment of the pH value to 
the target pH,295 using a diluted nitric acid solution (10%; 1.7 M) (HNO 3, Roth, HNO 3 suprapur 69% ). 
The NOM stock solutions  were stored at 4oC and used within one week.  
A VOC -mix standard (1000 µg mL-1 each in methanol , composition given in Table S 3.2) was obtained 
from Supelco (Bellefonte, USA) of which an aqueous stock solution of 0.1 mg L-1 was produced in a 
gastight amber  glass vial a few hours before use. DMS was added to this solution at 10-5 M (section 
3.4.3 ).  
3.2.2 Natural organic matter standards used and their phenolic content  
Previous kinetic experiments with HOBr and NOM showed that PLFA is the best proxy for marine DOM 
with respect to brominated trihalomethane (THM) formation.174 Furthermor e, its carbon to nitrogen 
ratio (C:N) is ≈ 8, which is similar to the C:N ratio of marine DOM.174  
PLFA has a low aromatic fraction of 12% (which is the lowest of all aquatic and terrestrial OM reference 
standards from IHSS)296 based on 13C NMR Estimates of Carbon Distribution. However, PLFA has a very 
limited availability, only permitting a small number of experiments. UMRNOM was selected as a 
second refere nce standard for marine DOM, which also has a low aromatic fraction of 19% (based on 
13C NMR Estimates of Carbon Distribution) .296 The phenolic content s of PLFA and UMRNOM have been 
previously determined via analysis of the electron donating capacity (EDC), resulting in 1.77 mmol 
phenol g-1 C for PLFA  297 174 and 2.8 mmol phenol g-1 C for UMRNOM .298 Batch experiments performed 
with 50 mg L-1 PLFA (26.2 mg C L-1) thus correspond to  46.5 µmol phenol L-1, whereas for UMRNOM 
concentrations of 50 and 100 mg L-1 (25 and 50 mg C L-1) correspond to 70 and 140 µmol phenol L-1, 
respectively.  
An overview of the used concentration ranges of DMS, HOBr, DOM and phenolic compounds in batch 
experiment s and how these compare to naturally occurring concentrat ion ranges is shown in Figure 
3.1A. It should be noted that HOBr concentrations used in batch experiments are much higher than 
actual HOBr concentrations in marine waters. These high levels of HOBr w ere necessary to quantify Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
63 
 the reactants and reaction products. However, as we used environmentally relevant DMS:DOM ( -
phenolic compound) concentration ratios, a similar fraction of HOBr is expected to react with DMS in 
batch experiments as under natural co nditions.  
DMS and HOBr fluxes in diffusion -reactor experiments and used flux ranges in a diffusion -reaction 
model (presented later) in comparison to typical DMS and HOBr fluxes during algal -bloom c onditions 
are shown in Figure 3.1B. The different concentration ranges, flux ranges, concentration to PhOH ratios 
and flux t o PhOH ratios shown in Figure 3.1 were determined based on  (i) the natural PhOH, DMS and 
HOBr co ncentration ranges ( section 3.4. 4), (ii) the natural DMS and HOBr fluxes occurri ng in algal 
blooms ( section 3.4. 5), and  (iii) the experimental DMS, HOBr and PhOH concentrations and  DMS and 
HOBr fluxes (Tables S 3.5 – S3.7).

 3.2.3 Kinetic experiments  
Kinetic experiments with HOBr, DMS and DOM were carried out in a simplified seawater medium 
containing typical concentrations of Cl- and Br- (0.55 M sodium chloride, NaCl: Merck, > 99.5% and 840 
µM potassium bromide, KBr: Sigma -Aldrich, > 99%).6 It was shown in a previous study that the 
contribution of other reactiv e Br species (i.e. Br 2, BrCl and Br 2O) to the oxidation of DMS is insignificant 
compared to HOBr.294 Befo re use, NaCl was recrystallized with a rotary evaporator to reduce the 
concentration of impurities, especially iodide (I-), which could potentially react with HOBr to 
hypoiodous acid and eventually iodate.191 The seawater mediu m was buffered with 50 mM phosphate 
(NaH 2PO 4, > 99 -102%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), Na 2HPO 4, Sigma -Aldrich, St. Louis, USA)). The pH 
of the solution was measured before and after each experiment and did not deviate more than 0.05 
units from the target pH.  
3.2.3.1 Batch experiments .  
Two series of batch experiments were performed. In the first series, variable DMS concentrations but 
constant HOBr and DOM concentrations were used to study the influence of DMS on the formation of 
THMs. In the second series, v ariable HOBr concentrations and constant DMS and DOM concentrations 
were used to investigate the role of HOBr for DMS consumption. Detailed information on these batch 
experiments, i.e., concentrations of DMS, HOBr, concentrations of DOM/phenolic moieties a nd 
concentration ratios of phenolic moieties to HOBr a nd DMS are provided in Table S 3.5. Experiments in 
the absence of DOM were not conducted in this study as i) the reactivity between HOBr and DMS in 
the absence of DOM was studied previously294 and is characterized by a quick and quantitative 
oxidation of DMS and ii) bromoform and other THM’s a re not produced in the absence of DOM.  
Experiments were carried out at pH 8 (present day ocean pH) and pH 7.5 (projected future ocean pH 
at high latitudes in 2100).192 All glassware (i.e., 10 mL ND20 headspace amber crimp vials, 46 × 22.5 
mm, BGB Analytics, Boeckten, Switzerland) was cleaned in a 0.5% nitric acid bath (Roth, HNO 3 Suprapur 
69%) for 24 hours, rinsed with ultrapure water and methanol, and dried under the fume hood before 
use.  
Reactions between HOBr, DOM and DMS were carried out in 10 mL gastight headspace amber vials 
(final volume = 10 mL) (ND20 46 × 22.5 mm, with magnetic crimp cap and 8 mm hole with Silicone/PTFE 
septa) under magnetic stirring .  Buffer medium, DOM and DMS were added to the vials in advance and 
the reaction was initiated by injecting 5 mL of a HOBr solution (1:1 volumetric ratio). Details on 
conce ntrations are given in Table S 3.5 (see also section 3.4. 7). For practical reasons, higher than 
natural HOBr:phenolic and DMS:phenolic moiety ratios were applied ( section 3.4. 6). For experiments Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
66 
 with constant DMS concentrations (0.5 µM), there is a small overlap of the DMS:phenolic moiety ratio 
with the corresponding ratio f or natural con ditions (Figure 3.1A).   
For all experiments, a reaction time of 10 min was used for practical reasons, i.e., to enable sampling 
at manageable time intervals. Furthermore, this reaction time warrants complete reactions between 
DMS, DOM and HOBr (t 1/2 < 0.01 seconds). After a reaction time of 10 min, NaNO 2 was added (final 
concentration: 100 µM) to quench potentially residual HOBr.  The quenched solution was subsequently 
transferred to 10 mL gastight headspace vials (1:10 dilution) and HPLC vials (EcoLine 1.5 mL crimp 
amber vials; BGB Analytics, Boeckten, Switzerland).  
3.2.3.2 Diffusion -reactor experiments . 
To mimic the natural marine DMS and HOBr diffusion fluxes in kinetic experiments, diffusion -reactors  
were constructed. A detailed overview of their design and used materials is provided in section 3.4. 8. 
Briefly, the diffusion -reactors consist of two outer chambers (one for a DMS solution and one for a 
HOBr solution) and a middle chamber (UMRNOM solution)  with volumes of 45, 48 an d 56 mL, 
respectively (Figure 3.2). The outer chambers are separated from the middle chamber by nanofiltration 
membranes (HOBr diffusion: GE Osmotics, HL series, General Electric Power & Water ; DMS diffusion: 
SIL-TEC sheeting, P/N  500-1, Technical Products Inc. of GA, Georgia, USA) ( section 3.4. 8 and section 
3.4.9), which control the diffusion of HOBr and DMS, respectively from the outer to the inner chamber. 
The membranes were selected on the basi s of diffusion tests (Figure S 3.2 and S 3.3). Similar to batch 
experiments , competition kinetics in the inner chamber were applied to study reactions of HOBr with 
both DMS and DOM.  
After the diffusion -reactor parts were assembled ( section 3.4. 10), all chambers were filled with a 
buffered a rtificial seawater solution  avoiding any headspace . Thereafter, all additions of solutions 
(DOM, DMS, HOBr) and sampling steps were performed by gastight syringes, using sampling ports with 
septa. The duration of the diffusion -reaction experiments was limi ted to two hours. The experimental 
procedure is described in detail in section 3.4. 11. HOBr concentrations from the HOBr chamber at t=0 
and t=120 min were photometrically quantified immediately after sampling using the ABTS -method.193 
For HOBr, initial tests had indicated HOBr loss in the HOBr chamber, which could not be explained by 
HOBr diffusion a lone. Therefore, the HOBr fluxes were estimated based on the polynomial regression 
of the HOBr -CHBr 3 and HOBr -CHBr 2Cl relationships from batch experiments (Figure S 3.4). Although the 
fluxes in diffusion -reactor experiments are at the upper end of reported fluxes in algal blooms (DMS) 
or exceed them (HOBr), the HOBr flux to PhOH concentration ratios are relatively close to natural 
conditions owing to the higher than natural PhOH concentrations ( section 3.4. 12). Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
67 
 To validate the experimental data and predict c oncentrations of DMS, DMSO, CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl 
(section 3.4. 12) as a function of the experiment -specific HOBr and DMS diffusion fluxes,  a chemical 
diffusion -reaction model was built with the Kintecus® software260 (Table S 3.8). With the determined 
HOBr and DMS diffusion rates ( section 3.4. 12), the kinetics of the DMS -HOBr294 and the phenolic 
moieties -HOBr reactions,19 model calculations were performed and compared to measured DMS and 
DMSO concentrations (Ta ble S 3.8). However, CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl concentrations were not modeled 
since the formation of these compounds is complex, involving multiple reaction pathway s. 
Bromination of UMRNOM is not well constrained in the scientific literature and attempting to model 
this process would introduce significant uncertainty.

Figure 3.2: Simplified schematic representation of two algal cells separated by seawater (top) and the 
diffusion -reactors mimicking this situation (bottom). For simplicity, only DMS production via DMSP is 
indicated in the top figure. The reactor system is a simplified  system, assuming that HOBr and DMS 
only react in seawater. Potentially, HOBr and DMS may also react in the phycosphere ,299 however, this 
was not studied here . The two outer chambers (corresponding to algal cells) are separated from the 
middle chamber (corresponding to the surrounding seawater), b y semipermeable nanofiltration 
membranes. The outer chambers are filled with simplified artificial seawater solutions containing HOBr 
and DMS, respectively, which diffuse to the middle chamber containing DOM (UMRNOM) in artificial 
seawater.  
3.2.4 Modeling concentrations of DMS, HOBr and CHBr 3 for natural DMS and HOBr fluxes  
The batch and diffusion -reactor experiments in this study represent simplified DMS -DOM -HOBr 
systems. To study more realistic conditions, i.e., accounting for natural marine DMS and HOBr fluxes, 
and to test which fluxes lead to a substantial reduction in concentrations of DMS, HOBr or CHBr 3, a 
diffusion -reaction model was developed. The influence of typical algal bloom DMS fluxes (10-13 – 10-9 
M s-1) on HOBr and CHBr 3 concentrations was ca lculated for a range of natural HOBr fluxes (10-13 – 10-
Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
69 
 9 M s-1) (section 3.4. 14) and vice versa, the influence of this range of HOBr fluxes on DMS 
concentrations was tested ( section 3.4. 14).  
Besides DMS and HOBr fluxes, the model included the following processes and reactions:  
(a) DMS reaction with HOBr and other oxidants (O 3, hypoiodous acid (HOI), H 2O2), (b) known DMS sinks 
(i.e. sea -air gas exchange (k sea-air), bacterial consumption (k bact), photochemical oxidation, (k photo)), (c) 
reactions of HOBr wi th phenolic moieties of DOM, considering the kinetics and efficiency  of CHBr 3 
formation, (d) sea -air gas exchange of CHBr 3 (as the major sink for marine CHBr 3), (e) other reactions 
with HOBr, i.e., with iodide and bromide (Br-), (f) iodine, bromine - and mi xed iodine -bromine reactions 
of reactive products from initial reactions (e.g., HOI), (g) abiotic formation of HOBr and HOI (oxidation 
of Br- and I- by O 3; oxidation of I- by HOBr). Potential reduction of DMSO to DMS was not taken into 
account in this stud y. Further details on the model, including the rate constants and concentrations 
are provided in section 3.4. 14.1.  
Although not experimentally studied, we also included the reaction of DMS with HOI in our model, 
with an estimated reactivity of 104 M-1 s-1 (section 3.4. 14.2). HOI and HOCl production from algae were 
not included in our model, for reasons explained in section 3.4. 14.3. 
The model was run for 24 hours. Steady -state concentrations for compounds (i.e. phenol, O 3, H 2O2, I-, 
Br- Cl-, H+, OH-) were used, assuming that diffusion processes will balance out reaction -induced local 
species depletion by transport of these compounds from the surrounding water.   
3.2.5 Analyses of DMS, THMs, DMS oxidation products and HOBr  
Concentrations of DMS and TH Ms were quantified immediately after the experiment using direct -
immersion solid -phase microextraction (DI -SPME) coupled to capillary gas chromatography -mass 
spectrometry (GC/MS), according to the method of Vriens et al.  (2015).102 DMS oxidation products 
were quantified within one week (storage at 4 °C) by HPLC (1200 series, Agilent  Technologies) coupled 
to an ICP -MS/MS instrument (ICP -MS 8900, Agilent Technologies) as described in Müller et al.  
(2019) .294 The limits of quantification (LOQs) for DMS, CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl were 1.7±1.4 nM, 0.6±0.5 
nM, and 0.6±0.5 nM, respectively. The LOQ for DMSO was 46.2 ±23.7 nM, as reported in our previous 
study.294 HOBr was quantified spectrophotometrically by the  ABTS  method at 405 nm (molar 
absorption coefficient : 31600 M-1 cm-1), as described in Pinkernell et al.  (2000).193

 3.3 Results and Discussion  
3.3.1 Reactions of HOBr with DMS and DOM in batch experiments  
3.3.1.1 Influence of the DOM type and concentration on the consumpti on of DMS and formation of 
DMSO .  
In the experiments using variable HOBr doses (DMS being held constant at around 500 nM, i.e. , 
between 458±11 and 489±2), the DMS consumption increased steeply with increasing HOBr for all 
DOM types and concentrations (Figure 3.3A). For HOBr doses < 9 µM, the highest proportion of abated 
DMS was observed for samples containing 26.2 mg C L-1 PLFA. Similar DMS concentrations were abated 
for samples containing 25 mg L-1 UMRNOM, whereas, significantly less DMS was abated in samples 
with 50 mg C L-1 UMRNOM. For HOBr doses ≥ 9 µM, DMS was below the LOQ (< 1.7 nM) for all DOM 
types and concentrations. A complete consumption of DMS by HOBr is remarkable considering the 
large excess of highly reactive phenolic moieties relative to DMS (molar phenolic moiety:DMS ratio for 
26.2 mg C L-1 PLFA: 94; for 25 mg C L-1 UMRNOM: 140; for 50 mg C L-1 UMRNOM: 280). This  can be 
explained by higher apparent first order rate constants for the DMS -HOBr reaction, i.e. k(HOBr,DMS) 
= 600 s-1 than for the phenol -HOBr reaction, i.e. k(HOBr,phenol) = 41 s-1, 62 s-1 and 124 s-1 for 26.2 mg 
C L-1 PLFA, 25 mg C L-1 UMRNOM and 50 mg C  L-1 UMRNOM, respectively at pH 8  (all first -order rate 
constants were obtained from batch experiments in this study) (see also section 3.4.6 ). Therefore, it 
can be expected that the DMS -HOBr reaction outcompetes the reaction between HOBr and DOM 
moieties after the fastest reacting moieties (e.g. resorcinol) have been titrated away for higher HOBr 
doses.  
DMSO was found to be the only product from the reaction  between DMS and HOBr (Figure 3.3A). Also 
in a previous study , done in  a synthetic DOM -free seawater  we could demonstrate that DMSO is the 
final product of the stoichiometric reaction between HOBr and DMS.294 
3.3.1.2 Influence of the DOM type and concentration on the formation of THMs.  
We identified CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl as sole products of the reaction between DOM and HOBr in the batch 
experiments. None of the other 18 compounds p resent in the VOC mix (Table S3.2) were detected. 
With increasing HOBr doses, CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl were produced non -linearly with a stronger increase 
at higher HOBr doses. Furthermore, CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl were only detected after DMS was  completely 
exhausted (Figure 3.3B). Interestingly, the experiment with 50 mg C L-1 UMRNOM resulted in lower 
production of CHBr 3 compared to 25 mg C L-1 (Figure 3.3B), which can be explained by the fact that in 
presence of more HOBr -reactive sites, the multiple bromination steps required to produce CHBr 3 are 
less likely.174 In contrast, experiments conducted with 26.2 mg C L-1 PLFA result ed in a lower production 
of CHBr 3 compared to 25 mg C L-1 UMRNOM (Figure 3.3B), likely due to the about 40% lower content Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
71 
 of phenolic moieties in PLFA compared to UMRNOM.174 These results confirm that CHBr 3 formation is 
favored by a high molar HOBr:DOC (or HOBr:phenolic moieties) concentration ratio and the absolute 
concentrations of phe nolic moieties.174  
For CHBr 2Cl production, we observed an even larger DOM -specific  influence than for CHBr 3, with 
highest production for experiments with 25 mg C L-1 UMRNOM, followed by 50 mg C L-1 UMRNOM and 
26.2 mg C L-1 PLFA (Figure 3.3B). The CHBr 3:CHBr 2Cl concentration ratios were significantly higher in 
the presence of 26.2 mg C L-1 PLFA (77 ± 23; Welch -test, t0 > tv; 0.975 ) compared to 25 mg C L-1 
UMRNOM (24 ± 18). The CHBr 3:CHBr 2Cl concentration ratio for the PLFA experiment agrees well with 
observed CHBr 3:CHBr 2Cl ratios in the natural marine environment ( ≈65)300 demonstrating again that 
PLFA is a good surrogate for natural marine DOM. We hypothesize that the chlorine in CHBr 2Cl 
originates from DOM and not from the artificial seawater matrix, since experiments in absence and 
presence of chloride yielded the same CHBr 2Cl concentrations ( section  3.4.16).  
3.3.1.3 Influence of variable DMS concentrations on the formation of Br -THMs .  
Figure 3.3C (pH 8) and Figure S 3.5 (pH 7.5) show the evolution of Br -THMs, DMS and DMSO for a 
constant HOBr concentration (45 µM) as a function of variable DMS doses in UMR NOM-containing 
buffered synthetic seawater. For DMS doses ≤ 20 µM, DMS was completely abated for HOBr doses of 
45 µM in the presence of 2 5 mg C L-1 UMRNOM f or both pH 7.5 and 8 (Figures 3.3C and S 3.5). For 
experiments with the highest DMS doses (40 and 50 µM), 10 -20% of the initial DMS remains after the 
reaction. For these DMS doses, the HOBr dose (45 µM) is slightly over - or under -stoichio metric, 
respectively. Since a fraction of HOBr is consumed by fast -reacting DOM moieties, not all DMS was 
oxidized to DMSO under these conditions, however, still the efficient oxidation of DMS indicates that 
HOBr is mainly consumed by DMS and not by DOM. F urthermore, the higher DMS concentrations 
resulted in an effective suppression of CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl formation. For a dose of 50 µM DMS, the 
production of CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl was suppressed to 5.7 and 8.4% of the blank value (corresponding to 
0 µM DMS), respe ctively, at pH 8 (Figure 3.3C) and to 3.6 and 4.0%, re spectively at pH 7.5 (Figure S 3.5). 
Overall, the results for DMS consumption/DMSO production and relative CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl 
suppression ar e comparable for pH 8 (Figure 3.3C) and 7.5 (Figure S 3.5). At bo th pH values, bromine is 
mainly present in its protonated form (HOBr fraction 0.86 and 0.95, for pH 8 and 7.5, respectively), 
which means that the bromine reactivity remains fairly constant. However, we observed on average a 
37% higher CHBr 3 and 29% higher  CHBr 2Cl production at pH 8 than at pH 7.5 after 10 minutes reaction 
time (Table S 3.12). This can be explained by the maximum rate for the reaction between HOBr and 
phenol/phenolate being at pH 9.4 (pH for k max = ½(pK 1+pK 2) = ½(8.8+10.0)) which is closer to pH 8. 
Nevertheless, we do not expect a significant reduction in THM formation as a result of a potential pH 
decrease from 8 to 7.5 since the reaction times in marine systems are much longer. However, ocean Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
72 
 acidification may lead to changes in marine com munity structure, HOBr production and qualitative/ 
quantitative changes in DOM among other factors, which may also affect THM production and these 
factors have not been investigated in this study.  
To conclude, the performed batch experiments clearly showed  that also in the presence of DOM (at 
relevant concentration ratios of DMS, HOBr and organic moieties), DMS is efficiently consumed by 
HOBr. Formation of CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl only occurred after DMS was completely depleted.

 3.3.2 Diffusion -reactor experiments   
Diffusion -reactor experiments were performed to mimic the dynamics of HOBr and DMS production 
and competition with DOM in a system including diffusion of DMS and HOBr. Before sampling, the 
system was allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes to stabilize the H OBr flux into the middle chamber. 
Meanwhile, DMS started to decrease in the middle chamber (Figure 3.4). After 120 minutes, the 
concentration of DMS in the middle chamber was below (reactor 1; R1) or slightly above the LOQ (4.5 
nM for reactor 2; R2), consi stent with modelled DMS (Table S 3.11). In contrast, concentrations of 
DMSO, CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl increased over time (Figure 3.4), as a result of the reactions between HOBr 
with DOM and DMS. The relatively low DMS concentrations in the middle chamber, in comp arison to 
higher DMSO concentrations is explained by the high HOBr diffusion rate  (with ΔHOBr diff > ΔDMS diff) 
and the high DMS -HOBr reactivity , which leads to an almost complete oxidation of DMS to DMSO with 
an accumulation of DMSO.  
The kinetic model (Tab le S3.8) indeed predicts DMS concentrations in the low nanomolar ra nge after 
120 minutes (Table S 3.11) and successfully models the evolution of DMSO concentrations (gre y lines 
in Figure 3.4; Table S 3.11). DMSO is produced from progressive oxidation of DMS by HOBr. The steady 
increase of CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl with increasing reaction time is explained by reaction of diffused HOBr 
with DOM, implying that despite a rapid consumption of HOBr by DMS, sufficient HOBr is available to 
react with UMRNOM. For the same HO Br and DMS fluxes, the calculated fractions of HOBr reacting 
with DMS and phenolic moieties (i.e. phenol and brominated phenols) are 0.86 and 0.14, respectively.

shown as grey lines), CHBr 3 (red) and CHBr 2Cl (yellow) in the middle chamber for two diffusion -reactor 
experiments (R1 (solid lines) & R2 (dashed lines)). Experimental conditions: pH 8, phosphate buffered 
artificial seawater medium ([PO4 tot] = 50 mM, [NaCl] = 0.55 M, [KBr] = 840 µM) with an UMRNOM 
concentration of 25 mg C L-1. DMS and HOBr fluxes were quantified as 6.0 x10-10 M s-1 and 9.8 x10-9 M s-
1 for R1 and 6.4 x10-10 M s-1 and 1.0 x10-8 M s-1 for R2, respectively ( for details see  section 3. 4.12 ). The 
middle chamber was sampled after 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. The grey band (t= 0 -30 min) represents the 
equilibration period for the system.   
3.3.2.1 Model calculations for diffusion -reactor experiments using constant phenol concentrations . 
The model based on results of the diffusion -reactor experiments indicates that high HOBr fluxes result 
in a decrease of the concentrations of phenolic moieties from initially 70 µM to 26 µM after 120 
minutes (Figure S 3.6). However, in the marine environmen t we expect fairly constant concentrations 
of phenolic moieties owing to their continuous production and diffusion processes. Therefore, the 
system was also modeled with a constant concentration of phenolic moieties (70 µM) to  study the 
effect on DMSO conc entra tions. The results ( section 3.4. 16 and section 3.4. 17) show that DMSO 
concentrations remain the same, whether or not the concentrations of phenolic moieties are varied. 
However, after 120 minutes the model indicates slightly higher DMS concentrations for constant 
concentrations of phenolic moieties (Figure S 3.7), i.e., 5.4 nM, than for variable concentrations of 
phenolic moieties (Figure S 3.6), i.e., 2.8 nM DMS. These slightly higher DMS concentrations are 
explained by a higher share of phenol reacting  with HOBr than DMS reacting with HOBr, when 
concentrations of phenolic moieties stay constant.

 3.3.3 Model simulations for the marine environment and implications  
To investigate the DMS -HOBr -DOM system more broadly, we modeled concentrations of DMS, HOBr  
and CHBr 3 as a function of a wide range of DMS and HOBr fluxes typical for algal blooms (10-13 M s-1 – 
10-9 M s-1) (Tables S 3.3 and S 3.4). The HOBr and DMS fluxes represent fluxes from the algal cells to the 
surrounding seawater . Tables S 3.9 and S 3.10 provide the deta ils of the model and Figures S 3.8 and 
S3.9 give the absolute concentrations of modelled HOBr, CHBr 3 and DMS concentrations as a function 
of the DMS and HOBr fluxes. Figure 3.5A shows concentrations of HOBr for the range of HOBr and DMS 
fluxes typical for algal blooms (10-13 – 10-9 M s-1) relative to the HOBr concentration in absence of a 
DMS flux. Figure 3.5B shows concentrations of CHBr 3 for the range of typical HOBr and DMS fluxes 
during algal blooms (10-13 – 10-9 M s-1) relative to the CH Br3 concentration in absence of a DMS flux. 
Figures 3.5A and 3.5B show that the reduction of HOBr and CHBr 3 concentrations is strongest for high 
DMS and low HOBr fluxes.  In contrast, for HOBr fluxes equal or lower than 10-11 M s-1, an increase in 
DMS flux  from 10-12 to 10-11 M s-1 leads to an average decrease in HOBr and CHBr 3 concentrations by 
48 and 86%, respectively. For HOBr fluxes at the upper end of estimated natural fluxes, i.e., between 
10-10 and 10-9 M s-1, an equal DMS flux is required to cause a  substantial reduction in concentrations of 
HOBr and CHBr 3 (Figures 3.5A and 3.5B). Figu re 3.5C shows concentrations of DMS for the range of 
HOBr and DMS fluxes typical for algal blooms (10-13 – 10-9 M-1 s-1) relative to the DMS concentration in 
absence of  a HOBr flux.  In analogy to the influence of HOBr and DMS fluxes on HOBr concentrations, 
an intermediate or higher HOBr flux (≥ 10-11 M s-1) in combination with an intermediate or lower DMS 
flux (≤ 10-11 M s-1), leads to a substantial reduction in DMS conc entrations.  
Although the extent of DMS consumption by HOBr clearly depends on the HOBr flux itself, also HOI,  
produced from the reaction between HOBr and I-,11 could be a sink for DMS. Therefore, we compared 
DMS consumption by HOBr and HOI, both as a function of HOBr fluxes and different HOI -DMS reaction 
scenarios (Figure S 3.10). Figure 3.5D illustrates the fraction of  DMS consumed via reactions with HOBr 
and HOI and loss by known DMS sinks (photochemical degradation, bacterial consumption and sea -air 
gas exchange) for varying HOBr fluxes. A higher fraction of DMS is consumed by HOBr in comparison 
to HOI for HOBr fluxes  equal or higher than 1 ×10-12 M s-1 (Figure S 3.10).  For HOBr fluxes lower than 
1×10-11 M s-1, DMS loss is mainly controlled by other DMS sinks, i.e. sea -air gas exchange, bacterial 
consumption and photochemical oxidation.  
Overall, our study confirms that HOBr can act as a sink for marine DMS. DMS can also act as a sink for 
HOBr, which may lead to a (partial) suppression of the formation of CHBr 3 for a wide range of natural 
DMS and HOBr fluxes. Previous studies assumed that HOBr mainly reacts with DOM -moiet ies to 
brominated products.9, 10 However, they did not take into account the reaction of  HOBr with DMS. 
Therefore, HOBr may affect the marine concentrations of DMS and CHBr 3, which could have Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM

 implications for atmospheric DMS and CHBr 3 concentrations via a reduced sea -air gas exchange of 
these compounds.

3.4.3  Production of stock solutions and standards  
The mixed VOC -DMS standard solution was used for GC/MS calibration curves (calibration range: 0 – 
10 µg L-1 for THMs, CHBr 3: 0 - 39.5  nM, CHBr 2Cl: 0 – 48 nM and DMS:  0 – 1 µM). Deuterated DMS (DMS -
d6, (CD 3)2S, 99 atom -% D, Sigma -Aldrich) and fluorobenzene (C 6H5F, 1000 µg mL-1, analytical grade, 
Sigma -Aldrich) were used as internal standards for DMS and VOC quantification, respectively).  
A stock solution of 10 mM sodium nitrite (NaNO 2, ≥ 98%, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), produced in a 20 
mL amber glass vial, was used to quench p otentially residual HOBr present after the targeted reaction 
time. To prevent nitrite oxidation to nitrate in the quenching solution, it was freshly produced before 
each experiment.  Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM

 3.4.4  Natural phenol, DMS and HOBr concentrations and calculated DMS/pheno l and HOBr/phenol 
ratios  in seawater  
In marine surface waters, the average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration is 82 µM,219 
corresponding to 1.74 µmol phenol L-1  when using the phenolic moieties content of PLFA ( 1.77 mmol 
phenol g-1 C). The annual latitudinal mean projected DMS concentrations is typically in the range of 1 -
7 nM,53 corresponding to a DMS:phenolic moiety concentration range of ≈ 4×10-3 – 6×10-4 (Figure 3.1A).  
Seasonal average concentrations of more than 10 nM DMS have been modeled for high latitudes,54, 301 
which indicates that higher DMS:phenolic moiety concentration ratios of > 4 ×10-3 likely exist locally 
and temporally. In the calculation of these ratios it is assumed that DOC concentrations are constant, 
i.e., that they do not substantially increase during an algal bloom. This assumption is based on a 
previous study reporting only  a twofold increase of DOC concentrations during a diatom bloom.302 
In a prev ious study, the marine steady -state concentration of HOBr was estimated to be 3 ×10-14 M, 
which corresponds to a HOBr:phenolic moiety concentration ratio of ≈1.7×10-8. 
3.4.5  Estimations of the ranges of DMS and HOBr fluxes in algal blooms  
The DMS and HOBr fluxes, as well as the DMS flux:phenolic moiety concentration - and HOBr flux: 
phenolic moiety concentration ratios used in the diffusion -reactor experiments are orders of 
magnitudes higher than the corresponding average fluxes and ratios in the natural mar ine 
environment. To compare the experimental DMS flux: phenolic moiety concentration - and HOBr flux: 
phenolic moiety concentration ratios to algal bloom conditions, we estimated the upper limit of DMS 
fluxes in algal blooms by combining DMS fluxes in DMS p roducing algae from literature with typical 
algal cell c oncentrations in blooms (Table S3. 3). In contrast to DMS fluxes, studies reporting HOBr 
fluxes are very rare and estimating an upper limit of HOBr fluxes is subject to considerable uncertainty 
(see Ta ble S 3.4).

macroalgae A. nodosum  and the study refers to “wet algae biomass”. Using biomass data for A. nodosum  and 
other macroalgae (see references above) giving a column in tegrated biomass (0.6 -12 kg dry weight m-2), we 
estimated that the dry weight biomass of 0.6 -12 kg m-2 corresponds to ca. 10 kg wet algae biomass m-2. We 
further assumed that this algal biomass is available in the top 10 m (depth of 10 m with a volume of 1 04 L). 
Multiplication of the flux by Wever et al. (1991) (68 nmol (g wet algae)-1 h-1) with the wet weight algae biomass 
(10 kg wet algae m-2) and division by 104 L results in an estimated flux of 1.9 ×10-11 mol L-1 s-1.

To produce CHBr 3 at quantifiable concentrations, we used a relatively high HOBr:phenolic moiety 
concentration ratio, i.e., 1 - 6.4×10-3 compared to a natural average ratio of ≈1.7×10-8 (based on a 
phenolic moiety concentration of 1.74 µM and an estimated HOBr steady -state  concentration of 3 ×10-
14 M) (Figure 3.1A). Still, HOBr:natural phenolic moiety concentration ratios that are orders of 
magnitude higher than average HOBr:natural phenolic moiety concentration ratios may occur locally 
and temporarily, depending on HOBr pro duction and sink processes. Also relatively high DMS:phenolic 
moiety concentration ratios were used for experiments with variable DMS concentrations (Figure 
3.1A). For experiments with constant DMS concentrations (0.5 µM), the DMS:phenolic moiety 
concentra tion ratio represents the highest value of the range of natural marine concentration ratios 
(Figure 3.1A).  
Based on the used DMS and PhOH concentrations and second -order rate constants for HOBr -DMS and 
HOBr -PhOH reactions (Table S 3.5), first -order rate co nstants  (k’) were calculated for HOBr 
consumption by multiplying second -order rate constants with the concentrations of DMS and PhOH in 
batch experiments (equations S 3.1-S3.4).  Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM

3.4.7  Batch experiments: Experimental versus natural HOBr:phenolic moiety and DMS:phenolic 
moiety concentration ratios  
3.4.7.1 Batch experiments with constant HOBr concentration and variable DMS concentrations  (see 
also Table S3.5) . 
The goal of the first series  of experiments was to study the effect of variable DMS concentrations on 
brominated trihalomethane (THM) production. Brominated THMs (e.g., CHBr 3) are well -known 
products of HOBr -DOM reactions. DMS might reduce the availability of HOBr for reactions with DOM 
and thus limit the production of brominated THMs. Therefore, DMS concentrations were varied for 
constant levels of DOM and HOBr and brominated THM production was monitored as a function of 
added DMS. Monitoring CHBr 3 as a function of the DMS concentrat ion is important for two reasons: 
(i) CHBr 3 is a volatile compound and highly relevant for atmospheric Br chemistry and ozone depletion 
and (ii) the formed CHBr 3 depends on the HOBr steady -state concentration, which is controlled by the 
DMS -HOBr reaction.  
Most of the kinetic experiments were carried out with UMRNOM, due to the limited availability of 
PLFA.296 First, phospha te buffer solution and UMRNOM were added to obtain final concentrations of 
25 mM and 25 mg C L-1 (final volume of 10 mL after HOBr addition), respectively. Immediately before 
reaction, DMS was added from the previously produced DMS stock solutions, to obta in final DMS 
concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 50 µM. The reaction was initiated by injecting 5 mL of a 
10-4 M HOBr solution into 5 mL of the above -mentioned solution containing the phosphate buffer, 
DOM and DMS, corresponding to a final HO Br dose of 45 µM. The methanol content (originating from 
dilution of the DMS stock solution prepared in methanol) of the reaction solution was 0 - 12.4 mM.  
Used ratio of HOBr concentrations (45 µM) to phenolic moieties concentrations (70 µM), i.e. 0.6, wa s 
higher than the average natural concentration ratio ( ≈1.7×10-8 for a phenolic moiety concentration of 
1.74 µM and an estimated HOBr steady -state concentration of 3 ×10-14 M). The DMS:phenolic moiety 
concentration ratio was 0.7 for samples containing 50 µM DMS compared to 3 ×10-4 – 6×10-4 in marine 
waters.   Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM

 3.4.7.2 Batch experiments with constant DMS  concentration  and variable HOBr doses  (see also Table 
S3.5) . 
To identify the fraction of oxidized DMS, a second series of experiments was carried out with a con stant 
initial DMS concentration (target concentration of around 500 nM) and HOBr doses between 0 – 45 
µM (final volume of 10 mL). These experiments were performed with an UMRNOM concentration of 
both 25 mg C L-1 or 50 mg C L-1 and were complemented with an  experiment with PLFA at a 
concentration of 26.2 mg C L-1. For UMRNOM concentration of 50 mg C L-1 we obtain a DMS:phenolic 
moiety ratio of 3.6 ×10-3. For the lower UMRNOM and PLFA concentrations of 25 mg C L-1 and 26.2 mg 
C L-1, respectively, DMS:phenolic moiety concentration ratios are 7 ×10-3 and 1 ×10-2, respectively, which 
are higher than the average natural ratios, but could still reflect marine concentration ratios for high 
DMS regimes (DMS > 20 nM).  
3.4.8  Construction of reactors and materials used  
Gastight reactors were constructed of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and contain three chambers 
(HOBr chamber: V = 48 mL, width: 40 mm, height: 60 mm, depth: 20 mm; DMS chamber: V = 45 mL, 
width: 40 mm, height: 60 mm, depth: 18.8 mm; middle chamber: V = 56  mL, width: 40 mm, height: 60 
mm, depth: 23.3 mm) , see Figure S 3.1). The chambers are separated by two different nanofiltration 
membranes. The membrane composition of the HL -membrane (molecular weight cut -off of 150 -300 
Da for uncharged organic molecules, GE Power & Water) is a combination of a polyamide and a 
polyethersulfone/polysulfone layer. This membrane type was selected as it retains trihalomethanes 
(THM) effectively and because it is largely resistant to HOBr.  
The other nanofiltration membrane is a silicone membrane (SIL -TEC sheeting) and has a good 
permeability for volatile compounds such as DMS (further information about the composition of this 
membrane is not provided by the manufacturer). Both membranes are connected to a PTFE plate 
containing 23 0 holes (diameter: 2.0 mm) resulting in an effective membrane surface of 722 mm2. The 
reactor parts are assembled with a 1 mm flat joint made of Fluoroelastomers  (FKM; Viton®, DuPont 
Performance Elastomers L.L.C.)  and attached with six long steel screws.  
Before the reactor parts were assembled, magnetic stirrer bars  (6×12 mm diam. x length) were placed 
in the three chambers. Screw caps on top of the chambers were equipped with either a valve -regulated 
tube or a septum, which both enable the injection of so lutions while ensuring gas tight conditions. 
Buffered artificial seawater was added with a plastic syringe through the tubes, whereas solutions of 
DMS and HOBr were injected into the DMS and HOBr chambers, respectively, through the septum 
using a 1 mL gast ight syringe (luer lock). Sampling of the middle chamber was also performed via a 1 
mL gastight syringe (luer lock).  Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM

3.4.9  Selection of membranes and determination of their diffusion rates for diffusion -reactor 
experiments  
3.4.9.1 Membranes tested for HOBr diffusion . 
To find an appropriate membrane for HOBr diffusion, we tested three different nanofiltration (NF) 
membrane types of the DK -, DL- and HL series (Lenntech, Delfgauw, Netherlands). In these tests, first, 
a solution of 50 mM PO 4tot (pH 8) was added to the HOBr chamber, and a solution containing 50 mM 
PO 4tot, 0.55 M NaCl and 840 µM KBr (artificial seawater) was added to the middle chamber. The artificial 
seawater medium was not used for the HOBr chamber to prevent potential formation of reactive 
species (BrCl, Br 2 and Br 2O), which are more diffusive than HOBr. The H OBr chamber had a target 
concentration of 2 mM, which enables a sufficient diffusion of HOBr into the middle chamber and a 
proper quantification of HOBr over a time period of 3 hours. The measured initial HOBr concentration 
(t=0) in the HOBr chamber for ex periments with different nanofiltration (NF) membrane types were:

 DK-membrane: 1.98 mM; DL -membrane: 1.94 mM; HL -membrane: 2.06 mM ). Diffused HOBr in the 
middle chamber was quantified for a total period of 3 hours by the ABTS method. From all tested 
membr anes the HL -membrane (a thin film composite (TFC) nanofiltration membrane) showed the 
highest diffusion rate (Figure S 3.2), allowing to use a relatively low HOBr concentration for the HOBr -
chamber and thereby limiting the risk for Br 2 formation in the expe riments by the HOBr+Br- reaction234 
(≈10% of total Br in the HOBr stock solution consist of Br-) and subsequent RHS diffusion (RHS are 
expected to be highly di ffusive compounds due to their small size and neutral charge). Therefore, the 
HL-membrane was selected for use between the HOBr chamber and the middle chamber.  
All tested membranes showed a lag -phase at the beginning, indicating an initial delay in HOBr d iffusion. 
This delayed HOBr diffusion is caused by reaction of HOBr with the membrane material, which was 
confirmed in separate tests (not shown here). Bromoform (CHBr 3) was the main reaction product but 
contrary to HOBr it cannot penetrate the membranes, which was also confirmed in separate diffusion 
tests with CHBr 3. In these CHBr 3 diffusion tests, the initial CHBr 3 concentration in the HOBr -chamber 
was 476 ±8.5 nM (n=3). This is twice or threefold the CHBr 3 concentration observed in the HOBr 
chamber of di ffusion -reaction experiments, whereas less than 0.2 nM CHBr 3 was found in the middle 
chamber after 2 hours (data not shown). Based on Figure S 3.2, we can express HOBr -diffusion through 
the HL -membrane by equation S 3.5. The linear curve in Figure S 3.2 allow s the assumption that the 
HOBr diffusion rate is constant after the equilibration phase and that the diffusion is proportional to 
the initial HOBr concentration. Therefore, the measured HOBr diffusion in Figure S 3.2 (given by the 
slope) is normalized by th e measured initial HOBr concentration of 2.06 mM (equation S 3.5):

Figure S 3.2: Diffusion of HOBr through different nanofiltration membranes (HL, DK and DL -Series). 
Diffusion experiments were performed at pH 8, using a phosphate buffered medium for the HOBr 
chamber (PO4 tot = 50 mM) and a phosphate buffered artificial seawater medium for the middle 
chamber ([PO4 tot = 50 mM; [NaCl] = 0.55 M; [KBr] = 840 µM). The HOBr chamber had an initial target 
concentration of 2 mM (for exact concentrations see text). The duration of the experiments was 3 
hours.  
3.4.9.2 Characterization of the SIL -TEC membrane used for the diffusion of DMS . 
Overall four DMS diffusion experiments were performed to characterize the SIL -TEC membrane. The 
chambers were filled with a buffered artificial seawater solution (pH 8; [PO4 tot] = 50 mM, [NaCl] = 0.55 
M; [KBr] = 84 0 µM). The DMS chamber of the individual experiments had initial DMS concentrations 
of 390 – 850 µM. DMS in the middle chamber was measured at least six times during a diffusion 
experiment of 2 -4 hours. The obtained DMS concentrations in the middle chamber  were divided by 
the initial DMS concentration in the DMS chamber. The average DMS diffusion, determined from the 
4 experiments was 1.04 ×10-3±1.7 ×10-4 min-1. In addition, HOBr and DMSO diffusion through the SIL -
TEC membrane was tested. These compounds diff use less efficiently compared to DMS (Figure S 3.3). 
Considering that also HOBr is rapidly consumed in the middle chamber via reactions with DOM and 
DMS, diffusion of HOBr from the middle chamber into the DMS chamber is not expected during the 
duration of t he experiment.  
DMS recovery expressed as total DMS in the reactor system after two hours relative to total DMS in 
the reactor system at the beginning (t=0) was 86.5 ±6.1 %. Potential DMS losses are volatilization and y = 0.5594x -4.5479

 adsorption to reactor components (walls,  membranes, sealing material). Owing to individual variable 
DMS -diffusion rates, it is more accurate to determine the experiment -specific DMS -diffusion based on 
DMS concentration differences in the DMS chamber before and after the experiment ( ΔDMS = DMS 0 
– DMS t). The experiment -specific DMS diffusion can be calculated based on the following equation : 
Diffused DMS (M s-1) = 𝛥𝐷𝑀𝑆

Δt is the duration of the experiment (s) ,

the DMS chamber is V = 45 mL. Hence, f = 45

Figure S 3.3: Diffusion of DMS, HOBr and DMSO through the SIL -TEC membrane. Diffusion experiments 
were performed at pH 8 in a phosphate buffered artificial seawater matrix ([PO4 tot = 50 mM; [NaCl] = 
0.55 M; [KBr] = 840 µM). Initial DMS concentrations in the DMS chamber  were 390 -850 µM. The 
duration of the experiments was 2 -4 hours.  
The SIL -TEC membrane had a good selectivity for DMS diffusion (> 1 ×10-3 min-1) and only limited 
diffusion of HOBr and DMSO, which is the main reaction product from the HOBr -DMS reaction. 
Therefore, this membrane was used for DMS diffusion between the DMS and middle chamber.  
3.4.10  Cleaning of reactor parts and membrane preparation  
Before use, all reactor components (apart from the membranes) were cleaned in a 0.5% nitric acid 
bath overnigh t and rinsed with ultrapure water. The GE -HL membrane was disinfected in a diluted 
sodium bisulfite solution (1%) prepared from a 40% solution (Lenntech, Delfgauw, Netherlands) in 
order to prevent bacterial growth. Afterwards, the GE -HL membrane was condit ioned in a 0.0E+003.0E-046.0E-049.0E-041.2E-031.5E-03Diffusion rate [min-1]DMS HOBr DMSOChapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM

 isopropanol:H 2O (1:1) solution (VWR chemicals, Radnor, Pennsylvania, USA) for 1 hour, and then 
thoroughly cleaned with ultrapure water. The SIL -TEC membrane was only cleaned with ultrapure 
water before use.  
It needs to be taken into account that  sulfite reacts with HOBr. Despite the thorough cleaning of the 
membrane with ultrapure water after the 1% sodium bisulfite treatment, it cannot be ruled out that 
residual sulfite on the HL -membranes was involved in HOBr consumption observed during the 
diffusion -reaction experiments. However, tests with treated (1% sodium bisulfite + isopropanol:H 2O = 
1:1) and untreated HL -membrane pieces exposed to HOBr showed both a similar production of CHBr 3, 
which is an indication that HOBr is mainly consumed by membra ne constituents and not by sulfite.  
3.4.11  Detailed procedure of diffusion -reactor experiments  
First, an UMRNOM stock solution (500 mg L-1; 250 mg C L-1) was added to the middle chamber to 
achieve a target concentration of 25 mg C L-1 DOM. Shortly after, D MS and HOBr were injected to the 
DMS and HOBr chambers, respectively, to achieve target concentrations of 10 µM and 1 mM, 
respectively. The solutions in all three chambers were constantly mixed by magnetic stirrer bars. After 
0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, 1 m L from the middle chamber was transferred to a 10 mL gastight 
headspace vial (1:10 dilution) and a 1.5 mL HPLC vial (undiluted). The DMS chamber was sampled 
immediately after DMS addition (t=0) and at the end of the experiment (t=120 min), to determine 
initial and final DMS concentrations and its diffusive flux during the experiment (Table S 3.6). After each 
sampling, the volume was replenished with buffer medium to keep the volume constant and minimize 
the headspace. The measured compound concentrations wer e corrected for buffer medium addition.   
3.4.12  Calculation of DMS - and HOBr -fluxes for the diffusion -reactor experiments  
DMS fluxes were calculated based on equation S 3.6. The corresponding values are summarized in Table 
S3.6.

 Approximate HOBr diffusion rates can be estimated based on equation S 3.5. However, the HOBr 
diffusion varies from experiment to experiment, wherefore, HOBr diffusion should be determined for 
each experiment. In contrast to DMS for which we determined the diffusion via the difference in 
concentrations of DMS in the DMS -chamber before and after the experiment, this approach is not 
possible for HOBr since i t reacts with membrane constituents. This approach would result in an 
overestimated HOBr diffusion flux. Alternatively, HOBr diffusion rates can be estimated from the 
relationship between HOBr and CHBr 3 or CHBr 2Cl concentrations from the batch experiments (Figure 
S3.4), assuming that these compounds constantly accumulate in the middle chamber. This assumption 
seems justified by the linear increase of CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl as a function of time (Figure 3.4).

performed with 25 mg C L-1 UMRNOM (n=2). Fit: Polynomial function third degree. Experimental 
conditions: pH 8, phosphate buffered artificial seawater medium: [PO 4tot] = 50 mM; [NaCl] = 0.55 M;

Based on measured CHBr 3 and CHBr 2Cl concentrations after 2 hours we determined the corresponding 
HOBr dose (HOBr calc) considering the HOBr -CHBr 3 and HOBr -CHBr 2Cl relationship from Figure S 3.4. To 
estimate total consumed HOBr, the measured DMSO concentration has to be added to [HOBr] calc, since 
the production of DMSO consumes HOBr in a 1:1 stoichiometry via the DMS -HOBr reaction. 
Consequently, the HOBr diffusion can be calculated from the consumed total HOBr concentration 
divided by the duration of the experiment (eq uation S 3.7).

The derived HOBr fluxes for the two diffusion -reactor experiments are provided in Table S 3.7. There is 
a good agreement of predicted HOBr concentrations based on the CHBr 3-HOBr relationship and the 
CHBr 2Cl-HOBr relationship. With the information on HOBr fluxes the HOBr diffusion into the middle 
chamber can be assessed for the diffusion -reactor experiment s. Although the HOBr diffusion fluxes 
were high with around 10-8 M s-1, the concentration of total diffused HOBr in the middle chamber after 
2 hours was lower than the sum of the concentrations of the substrates (phenolic moieties and diffused 
DMS) (Table S3.7).  
The absolute DMS and HOBr fluxes that we studied in the diffusion -reactor experiments do not 
represent (the full) range of natural fluxes. The DMS fluxes represent maximum values of reported 
fluxes in algal blooms and HOBr fluxes were 1 to 2 orders  of magnitude higher than maximum reported 
fluxes in algal blooms ( section 3.4. 5). However, as we also used phenolic moiety concentrations that 
were 40 -times higher than in natural systems (70 µM instead of 1.75 µM), the HOBr -flux to PhOH ratios 
are within  the natural  range (HOBr flux:PhOH reactor = 9.9  10-5 s-1 - 1.0  10-4 s-1; HOBr flux:PhOH 
natural: 9.7  10-7 s-1 - 2.9  10-4 s-1) (Figure 3.1B).

 Table S 3.7: Derivation of HOBr fluxes for the two diffusion -reactor experiments (R1 and R2). The 
duration of the experiments was 2 hours. Values without brackets refer to CHBr 3, values in brackets 
refer to CHBr 2Cl. From the initial HOBr concentration in the HOBr -chamber (HOBr 0, row 2), the total 
diffused HOBr into the middle chamber is calcul ated (row 6) based on HOBr diffusion experiments. The 
dose of the diffused HOBr can be transformed to a diffusion flux (diffusion flux = diffused HOBr divided 
by the reaction time) (row 8). Alternatively – and more reliable – diffused HOBr into the middle 
chamber is calculated based on the CHBr 3 (CHBr 2Cl) -HOBr relationship (row 3). To determine the total 
dose of diffused HOBr into the middle chamber (row 5), the measured DMSO concentration in the 
middle chamber (row 4) has to be included (see text). The to tal dose of diffused HOBr into the middle 
chamber (row 5) can be transformed to a HOBr diffusion flux (diffusion flux = diffused HOBr divided by 
the reaction time) (row 7), which was used for the reactor model.  
HOBr diffusion experiments demonstrated that HOBr diffusion is much slower than DMS diffusion 
when using the same initial concentration in the outer chamber (Figure S 3.2 and S 3.3). To overcome 
this effect, we used a ca. 100 times higher concentration of HOBr than DMS.

was included in the model (15 M-1 s-1), based on data from Westerhoff et al. (2004)18 This slower stage rate 
constant was included in the model as the HOBr -DOM reactivity is better reflected that way, and it might have 
an effect on DMS consumption/DMSO production.

3.4.14.2 Assessment of the DMS -HOI reactivity . 
HOI is a potential sink of DMS as it has relatively high steady -state concentration in the nanomolar 
range in marine waters.314 HOI is produced from the fast reaction of  I- with HOBr ( k’’HOBr+I - = 5  109 M-
1 s-1)11 and this reaction was thus also included in the models. As the reactivity between HOI and DMS 
is unknown, we estim ated its reactivity based on (i) reactivity of HOI with a compound structurally 
related to DMS (methionine), and (ii) reactivities of HOCl and HOBr with DMS and methionine.  
For the reaction between HOI and methionine, a second order rate constant of 165 M-1 s-1 is 
reported,315 which is much l ower compared to the methionine -HOBr ( k’’HOBr+Met  = 3.6   106 M-1 s-1)99  
and methion ine-HOCl ( k’’HOCl+Met  = 3.8   107 M-1 s-1)194 reactions. Reactivities of HOBr and HOCl with Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
97 
 DMS ( k’’HOBr+DMS =1.6   109 M-1 s-1 294, k’’HOCl+DMS =2.6   109 M-1 s-1 101) are ca. 2 orders o f magnitude higher 
than reactivities of HOBr and HOCl with methionine). We assume that equally to HOBr and HOCl, also 
HOI reacts ca. 2 orders of magnitude faster with DMS than with methionine. Therefore, the second 
order rate constant for the reaction betw een HOI and DMS was estimated as 104 M-1 s-1. Model 
simulations were also performed with second order rate constants of 103 M-1 s-1 and 105 M-1 s-1 to cover 
a larger range of the HOI -DMS reactivities and test the significance of this reaction for DMS 
trans formation.   
3.4.14.3 HOI- and HOCl production fluxes by algae . 
HOI and HOCl production from algae were not included in our model due to the scarce quantitative 
information on these processes. Furthermore, algal production of HOI was previously estimated to  
be less important than HOBr production.10 Instead, important sources for HOI are reactions of I- with 
O3 and HOBr.152  HOCl can only be produced by chloroperoxidases (not by bromoperoxidases)321 and 
would react immediately with Br-,16 however, this pathway is not assumed to contribute significantly 
to HOBr production.197

3.4.16  Hypothesis for the production of CHBr 2Cl 
There are two hypotheses explaining the origin of the Cl atom in CHBr 2Cl: Either, Cl is derived from the 
artificial seawater medium (Cl-) and  incorporated into CHBr 2Cl via substitution reactions, or the Cl atom 
in CHBr 2Cl originates from DOM itself.  An experiment using UMRNOM performed in a Cl- free medium 
(data not shown) resulted in the same CHBr 2Cl production as in artificial seawater . This strongly 
suggests that the Cl atom in CHBr 2Cl originates from DOM. As the production of CHBr 2Cl (and Chapter 3. Batch & Reactor experiments with DOM  
98 
 CHBr 2Cl:CHBr 3 ratio) was significantly higher for UMRNOM than for PLFA, we hypothesize that 
UMRNOM has a higher Cl content than PLFA. However, it was out of the scope of the present research 
project to study differences between Cl contents in UMRNOM and PLFA.

Abstract  
Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient  for many living organisms  particularly due to its unique 
redox properti es. We recently found that the sulfur  (S) analog for  dimethyl selenide (DMSe) , i.e. 
dimethyl sulfide (DMS) , reacts fast with the marine oxidant hypobromous acid (HOBr)  which likely 
serves as a sink of marine DMS. Here we investigated the reactivity of HOBr with DMSe and other 
organic Se  compounds  known to be present in marine environments and organisms,  i.e., dimethyl 
diselenide (DMDSe), SeMet (as N-acetylated -SeMet) , and selenocystine (SeCys 2 as N-acetylated -
SeCys 2). We also studied the HOBr -reactivity of diphenyl selenenide (DPSe) and diphenyl diselenide 
(DPDSe), which are the phenyl -analogs of DMSe and DMDSe, respectively . Apparent second -order rate 
constants at pH 8 for the reaction s of HOBr with the studied Se compound s were 3.2  108 M-1 s-1 for 
SeMet, 8.3  107 M-1 s-1 for DMSe, 5.0  107 M-1 s-1 for DMDSe , 4.4  107 M-1 s-1 for SeCys 2, 4.0  107 M-
1 s-1 for DPSe, and 9.4  106 M-1 s-1 for DPDSe , indicating a very high reactivity of all s elected  Se 
compounds with HOBr . The reactivity between HOBr and DMSe is lower than for DMS and therefore Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
104 
 this reaction is likely not relevant for marine DMSe degradation. However, the high reactivity of SeMet 
with HOBr  suggests  that SeMet may act as a relevant quencher of HOBr in biologi cal systems . 
4.1 Introduction  
Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for many living organisms, including mammals, bacteria 
and archaea, and some species of microalgae, while the essentiality of Se for plants is still 
controversial .121, 133, 322, 323 Multiple biological functions and beneficial effects on organisms’ health are 
attributed to Se, based on the redox activity of Se compounds . Undersupply of Se has been associated 
with various human health i ssues, including cardio -myopathy (Keshan disease), cancer, immune and 
endocrine disfunction, muscle and bone disorder, neurodegenerative diseases, decreased thyroid 
function and male infertility.118, 119 It has been estimated that inadequate Se supply may affect roughly 
15% of the global population .324  
Selenium contents of plant -based food products, which are an imp ortant  dietary source of Se to 
humans, largely depend on Se concentrations and bioavailability in soils.120, 123 For regions 
characterized by low Se concentrations in bedrock, i.e., most agricultural regions in the world, 
atmospheric deposition of inorganic Se (i.e. , selenite [Se (IV) ] and  selenate [Se(VI) ]) is an important 
source of Se to soils and terrestrial foodchains.124, 125, 325, 326 Atmospheric Se has both anthropogenic 
and natural sources of which biogenic marine Se emissions constitu te the largest natural source, 
estimated to amount between 10 and 15 Gg Se yr−1.124  Marine emissio ns of Se are mainly in the form 
of dimethyl selenide (DMSe) and to a lesser extent dimethyl diselenide (DMDSe) and dimethyl 
selenenylsulfide (DMSeS).116, 125 However, research on marine biogenic Se sources and sinks is 
relatively scarce, especially compared to the sulfur (S) analog of DMSe, i.e., dimethylsulfide (DMS).  
DMSe producti on has so far been reported for macroalgae,327 green freshwater algae,328, 329 plants and 
marine bacteria ,131, 169 and has been suggested for marine microalgae  such as  coccolithophorids   
(Figur e 4.1; Table S 4.1).116, 330 -333 In marine  waters, DMSe was detecte d in concentrations ranging  from  
0.06 to 4.73 pM ,116, 333 and its production has been suggested to proceed similarly as DMS production 
via the analog Se - compound of dimethyl sulfonio propionate (DMSP ), i.e., dimethylselenopropionate 
(DMSeP) .132 So far, a n assimilation pathway of inorganic Se to DMSeP has been reported for pl ants130 
and is suggested for marine algae wit h the amino acids selenocysteine (SeCys) and selenomethionine 
(SeMet) as intermediates.133, 334 Other DMSe production pathwa ys, that do not depend on DMSeP 
production (e.g. via cleavage of methyl -SeMet) , have  also been  suggested  136, 137 Marine bacteria can 
take up dissolved organic Se species excreted by algal cells (e.g. dissolved DMSeP, DMSeP d)335 or also 
inorganic Se species (Figure 4.1).336, 337  Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds

For DMDSe, which has been reported in concentration s between 0.02 - 0.26 pM Se in marine waters,116, 
333 the production pathways are largely unexplored. Studies with plants indicated that Se  amino acids 
are not only precursors for DMSeP and DMSe but also for DMDSe via intracellular methylation of 
SeCys.338, 339 Schiavon et al.  (2017)  suggested that this process ma y also exist in algae (Figure 4.1)133, 
while other studies reported abiotic formation of DMDSe  from  selenols,340, 341 SeMet340 and SeCys 2340 
compounds (Figure 4.1).  
Information  on production of DMSe and other  volatile Se species is relatively scarce  but even less 
information is available on marine sinks of DMSe and DMDSe. Nevertheless , understanding sink 
Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
106 
 processes is crucial to be able to predict fluxes of these compounds from the ocean to the atmosphere. 
For DMSe, o nly sea -air gas exchange116 and photochemical degra dation342 were quantified as potential 
sinks  while f or DMDSe and DMSeS  species, mar ine sinks remain  fully unknown.  Recently , we reported 
a fast reaction between DMS and the marine oxidant hypobromous acid (HOBr) (second -order rate 
constant: k = 1.6   109 M-1 s-1) and concluded that this reaction is likely an important sink for marine 
DMS .294, 343 HOBr is produced in marine waters, via the oxidation of bromide (Br-) by H 2O2, catalyzed by 
the enzyme Vanadium -bromoperoxidase (V -BrPO).9  Based on the fast reaction between DMS and 
HOBr, we hypothesize that HOBr also rapidly  reacts with DMSe and potentially  with DMDSe, which 
would make these reactions potential sink s for these compounds. This hypothesis is s upport ed by the 
higher second -order rate constants for the reactions of hydrogen peroxide107 and peroxynitrite108 with  
SeMet, which is  a selenoether  like DMSe , compared to its S -analog methionine .  
Since HOBr production is also documented in mammalian heme peroxidases (especially eosinophil 
peroxidase) , thereby contributing to oxidative stress, 4, 5, 344 SeMet might be a relevant quencher for 
HOBr in biological systems, particula rly as it is a major Se -containing amino acid in living organisms.  In 
this respect, SeMet might not only act as an antioxidant in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
but also in neutralizing HOB r. As a consequence , the reaction between SeMet and HOBr is likely not 
restricted to the marine environment but is potentially also important  in biological systems.  
Compared to sulfur, redox reaction s for the analogous  Se compounds  generally have been reported to 
be faster. Oxidation and reduction reactions with  Se compounds occur with second -order rate 
constants, which are 1 -4 orders of magnitude higher than for the analogous S compounds.  109 The Se 
amino acids SeCys (also referred to the 21st amino acid) and SeMet, are quickly oxidized to the 
diselenide “selenocystine (SeCys 2)” and the selenoxide “Selenomethionine -oxide”, respectively, but 
also rapidly reduced back to SeCys and SeMet.103, 106, 107, 109-111  
The main objective of this study w as to determine t he kinetics of the reactions between HOBr and 
DMSe, DMDSe,  SeMet (as N-acetylated -SeMet), and SeCys 2 (as N-acetylated -SeCys 2). These 
compounds are volatile Se species (DMSe, DMDSe) or likely precursors of them in marine organisms 
(SeMet, SeCys 2) and have  antioxida nt properties (SeMet, SeCys 2).  We also investigated  the reactions 
of HOBr with the aryl -analogs of DMSe and DMDSe, i.e. , diphenyl selenide (DPSe) and diphenyl 
diselenide (DPDSe) , which are i ndustrially produced organic Se compounds, which are us ed in chemical 
synthesis and as green catalysts  for medical and pharmalogical purposes.145, 345, 346 We studied these 
compounds to  obtain  further insights into  the effect of Se oxidation state and molecular structure on 
the reactivity of organic  Se compounds with HOBr . A furth er objective was to identify and quantify  the 
products of the  above -mentioned  reactions for different molar HOBr:Se  compound ratios using high -Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
107 
 resolution mass spectrometry (HR -MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectro metry ( LC-ICP-MS/MS ). Finally, we compare d the reactivity of HOBr of the  
selected  organic Se compounds with the analogous S compound s. 
 
4.2 Materials and Methods  
4.2.1 Chemicals and reagents  
For treatment of glassware and handling of chemicals see section 4.4.2). A list with information of all 
used chemicals is provided  in Table S 4.2.  
4.2.1.1 Reagents for kinetic experiments . 
Se compounds :  Stock solutions of dimethyl selenide (DMSe), dimethyl diselenide (DMDSe) and 
diphenyl selenide (DPSe) were produced in gastight 10 mL headspace amber crimp vials (ND20, 46 x 
22.5 mm, BGB Analytics, Boeckten, Switzerland)  by diluting the pure substance in methanol (0.25%; 
corresponding to ca. 25 mM of the Se  compound concentration). Stock solutions of diphenyl diselenide 
(DPDSe), seleno -DL-methionine (SeMet) and seleno -L-cystine (SeCys 2) were produced by weighing the 
required quantity of the solid material in a 10 mL headspace amber crimp vial and dissolving it either 
in ethanol or water (6 mM DPDSe in ethanol, 6 mM SeMet in water and 0.6 mM SeCys 2 in water). 
Solutions of the volatile substances DMSe and DMDSe were produced daily, whereas the other Se 
stock solutions were produced monthly.  
Acetylation of SeMet and SeCys 2 amino groups:  Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (BOC 2O) and sodium 
hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO 3) were used to acetylate the amino group s of SeMet and SeCys 2 to block 
it against reactions with HOBr (method described in section 4.4.3 ).  The stability of the BOC 2O-
protection group for N-acetylated -SeMet and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 was tested by chlo ramine formation 
during chlorination (see Table S 4.2 and section 4.4.4 ). 
HOBr : Stock solutions of HOBr were produced by mixing sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and potassium 
bromide (KBr), as described in Müller et al. (2019).294   
Competitors for competition kineti cs: Resorcinol and 1,3,5 -trimethoxybenzene (TMB)  were used as 
com petitors for competition kinetics. A 250 mM resorcinol stock solution was produced in ultrapure 
water and further diluted to working concentrations of 2.5 mM and 250 µM. A saturated solution of 
TMB was produced in ultrapure water and its effective concentr ation was determined by a methanolic 
stock solution of known concentration (dissolved TMB concentration: 2.5 mM in water). Both 
resorcinol and TMB stock solutions were stored in 10 mL headspace amber crimp vials at 4 °C.

 4.2.1.2 Buffer and standard solutions . 
Phosphate buffer solutions (40 mM PO4 tot, pH 8) and artificial seawater medium (0.55 M sodium 
chloride, NaCl;  840 µM potassium bromide, KBr) were used for kinetic experiments  (for more details 
see Müller et al.  (2019) ).294 NaHCO 3 (1 mM, pH 8) was used as a buffer solution for Se -product analyses.  
Potassium perchlorate ( KClO 4) was used to maintain constant ionic strength of the reaction solution. 
Concentrations of 100 and 50 mM were used depending on the phosphate buffer concentration and 
solution pH.  
Standard solutions of Se compounds  and competitors were prepared freshly every day for the 
followin g calibration ranges: DMSe = 0 -800 nM, DMDSe =0 -125 nM, DPSe, Res, TMB = 1.67 -16.7 µM, 
DPDSe = 1 -10 µM.  
4.2.2 Kinetic experiments and determination of second -order rate constants  
For the reactions of DMSe, DMDSe, DPSe, N-acetylated -SeMet and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 with HOBr , 
experiments were performed by competition kinetics with resorcinol as a competitor (Table 4.1), 
which has a pH-dependent  reactivity with HOBr (section 4.4.5 ). For the kinetic experiments with 
DPDSe, TMB was used as a competitor (Table 4.1). To study the reactivity of bromine with organic Se 
compounds , three experimental replicates were conducted at pH 8 , which represents the average 
ocean pH and is close to physiological conditions. For the kinetic experiments, we followed the 
protocol used in Müller et al.  (2019)294 for organic S  compounds, but using lower concentrations of 
organic Se  compo unds and thus of HOBr and phosphate buffer as well . For the kinetic experiments 
with DMSe, DMDSe, DPDSe, DPSe, N-acetylated -SeMet , the concentrations were as follows: 
phosphate buffer solution (pH 8), 20 mM ; organic Se compound, 12.5 µM; and competitor , 12.5 µM. 
Kinetic experiments with N-acetylated -SeCys 2 were performed with lower phosphate buffer and 
concentrations of Se compounds, i.e., 10 mM and 8 µM, respectively  (competitor at 12.5 µM). For 
experiments with DPDSe, the concentration s were as follows: 10 mM, 2.9 µM and 6.25 µM, 
respectively . No methanol  (MeOH) was used for the experiments with N-acetylated -SeMet, while 0.5 
% MeOH was used for experiments with DMSe, DMDSe, DPSe, and 5% MeOH for DPDSe and N-
acetylated -SeCys 2.  
Owing to the relevance of DM Se and DMDSe in marine waters, kinetic experiments with DMSe and 
DMDSe were performed in buffered artificial seawater medium  in addition to ultrapure water . 
Reactions were initiated by injecting HOBr in a volumetric 1:1 ratio, targeting doses of 0, 2.5, 5,  7.5, 
10, 12.5, 15 µM HOBr (for experiments with DMSe, DPSe and N-acetylated -SeMet); 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 
µM HOBr (for experiments with DMDSe and N-acetylated -SeCys 2); and  0, 2.5, 3.75, 5, 6.25, 7.5 µM 
HOBr (for experiments with DPDSe). To guarantee fast and complete HOBr consumption , i.e., within 1 Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
109 
 min under magnetic stirring , all HOBr doses were lower than the sum of the concentrations of target 
compound and the competitor. After a 1 min reaction time , reaction solutions were diluted 1:100 to 
10 mL heads pace amber crimp vials for DMSe and DMDSe quantification and transferred to HPLC vials 
for the quantification of DPSe, DPDSe, N-acetylated -SeMet, N-acetylated -SeCys 2, resorcinol and TMB. 
DMSe, DMDSe, DPSe and DPDSe were immediately measured after experimen ts due to their volatility 
(DMSe and DMDSe) or observed instability in diluted aqueous solutions (DPSe and DPDSe). N-
acetylated -SeMet , N-acetylated -SeCys 2 and resorcinol from experiments with DMS and DMDSe were 
measured within one week  and stored beforehand at 4 °C. The pH of reaction solutions was 
immediately measured after each experiment and did not deviate more than 0.05 units from the initial 
pH.  
4.2.2. 2 Analyses of organic Se compounds and the competitors .  
Concentrations of DMSe and DMDSe were quantified using direct -immersion solid -phase 
microextraction (DI -SPME) coupled to capillary gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (DI -
SPME -GC/MS) as described in Vriens et al.  (2015).102 Concentrations of DPSe, DPDSe, N-acetylated -
SeMet , N-acetylated -SeCys 2, resorcinol and TMB were quant ified by HPLC/ UV, using a Dionex Ultimate 
3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and a Cosmosil C 18 column 
(3.0 ID X 100 mm ; Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan).  For detailed information about the quantification 
of Se compounds  and competitors , see section 4.4.6 . The limits of quantification  (LOQs)  obtained for 
DMSe, DMDSe, DPSe, DPDSe, resorcinol and TMB were respectively, 11 ±6 nM, 2.0 ±1.2 nM, 96 ±35 nM, 
56±9 nM, 182 ±113 and 32± 9 nM (method  for determination of LOQs  described in section 4.4.7 ). LOQs 
for N-acetylated -SeMet and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 were approximately 240 nM and 760 nM, 
respectively.  
4.2.2. 3 Determination of second -order rate constants . 
The second -order rate constants for the reactions between HOBr and the organic Se compounds  were 
calculated based on the experimentally obtained slope s (natural logarithm (ln) of the relative residual 
concentration of the Se  compound versus the ln of the relative residual concentration of the 
competitor). Results from the individual kinetic experiments  performed at pH 8 , and the reported 
second -order rate constant s of the reaction s between HOBr and the competitors are provided in 
sections 4.4. 5 and 4.4.8, respectively. Summary plots representing  average slope value s for all 
experiments are presented in section 4.4.9 .

 4.2.3 Identification and (semi)quantification of Se -containing oxidation products   
To investigate the products of the reactions of HOBr with selected organic Se compounds, batch 
experiments were performed in 10 mL amber gastight headspace vials using a 1 mM NaHCO 3-buffer 
solution (pH 8) and variable molar HOBr:Se  compound ratios (i.e., 0:1 [Se  compound blank], 1:1, 3:1 
and 10:1). The initial concentration of the Se compounds  was 6.25 µM. After 1 min of reaction t ime 
under magnetic stirring ( t1/2 ≈ 0.01 seconds), the solutions were mixed with methanol containing 0.1% 
formic acid (volumetric 1:1 ratio) and analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry (HR -MS) within 
the next 10  hours . The HR -MS system (QExactive HF OrbitrapTM, Thermo Scientific, Switzerland) was  
equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI) and was calibrated before analyses  (PierceTM ESI 
solutions) . All analyses were performed as direct infusion in the positive ionization mode . Selenium 
comp ounds in the recorded mass spectra were detected based on the specific Se isotopic pattern. The 
oxidation products were then identified using the software “Freestyle ” (Thermo Scientific) and the 
Eawag tool “enviPat h”347. Once identified, a semi -quantification of the Se -containing oxidation 
products was carried out by record ing single ion mode (SIM) spectra at their nominal mass for each 
condition, and the intensity was retrieved using the Freestyle software. Further details about HR -MS 
analysis are provided  in the section 4.4.10 . To quantify potential formation of inorganic Se (SeO 32- [IV] 
and SeO 42- [VI]), reaction products were additionally analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to 
inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry (LC -ICP-MS/MS) . The system consisted of an 
Agilent LC 1200 series coupled to an Agilent 8800 ICP -MS/MS. The chromatographic separation was 
adapted from Tolu et al.  (2011),348 i.e., using an anion exchange column (Hamilton PRP -X100, 100 × 4.1 
mm, 10 μm, with the appropriate guard column) and a gradient elution of ammonium citrate (4 to 10 
mM; pH 5.2). The mobile phase was delivered at 1.25  mL min-1 and the volume of injection was 25 µL.   
4.3 Results and Discussion  
4.3.1 Reactivities of the selected  organic selenium compounds with HOBr in buffered ultrapure 
water  and artificial seawater  
The apparent second -order rate constants (pH 8) for the reactions between the selected  organic Se  
compounds and HOBr are provided in Table 4.1 and ranged between 8.0  106 and 2.8  108 M-1 s-1, 
indicating a very high reactivity of all studied Se compounds . Monoselenides had a significantly higher 
reactivity than the analo gous dis elenides  since the apparent  second -order rate constants for DMSe, 
DPSe  and N-acetyl ated -SeMet  are respectively, 1.7, 4.4 and 7.4 times higher than for the ir diselenides 
analogs, i.e., DMDSe , DPDSe, and  N-acetylated -SeCys 2 (Table 4.1). The  relatively higher reactivity of 
monoselenides compared to diselenides can be explained by the lower oxidation state of Se  in 
diselenides (oxidation state of -I) as compared to m onoseleni des (oxidation state  of –II). Therefore, the Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
111 
 electron density in Se in monoselenides is higher than for the corresponding diselenides, which makes 
monoselenides better nucleophiles.  Apart from the effect of Se oxidation state, we observed that Se 
compounds  with alkyl substituents had a higher reactivity than those with aryl substituents . A 
reactivity enhancement by a factor  of 2.1 and 5.3 was observed, respectively, for DMSe versus DPSe 
and DMDSe versus DPDSe (Table 4.1). Alkyl substituents have a positive inductive effect (i.e., electron 
donating effect, +I effect ), while aryl substituents have a positive mesomeric (i.e., effect of electron 
delocalization, +M effect) but a negative inductive effect (i.e. electron withdrawing effect, -I effect). In 
this resp ect, alkyl substituents makes the Se -atom more nucleophilic than aryl substituents, which 
might explain the higher reactivity of alkylated compared to arylated Se -species with the electrophilic 
HOBr. For the  alkylated monoselenide compound N-acetylated -SeM et, an apparent  second -order rate 
constant with  HOBr of 2.8  108 M-1 s-1 was obtained, that is 3.9 times higher than for DMSe, although 
both Se compounds  are selenoethers with two methyl groups at the Se -atom. This indicates that the 
Se atom in SeMet is the preferred site of HOBr attack at pH 8 and that the amino group only plays a 
minor role ( kapp,pH8,NH2+HOBr  ≈ 106 M-1 s-1).16, 349, 350 The apparent second -order rate c onstant determined 
in this study is about 20 times higher than a previous value ( 1.4   107 M-1 s-1) 158 that was also derived 
by competition kinetic s but using  N-acetyl -Tyrosin (N -ac-Tyr) as a competitor  at pH 7.4. The N-ac-Tyr 
used by Storkey et al . (2012 ) has a  much lower HOBr  reactivity (k HOBr+N ‑Ac‑Tyr = 2.6   105 M−1 s−1) than  
SeMet , and such a large difference in reactivity between the target compound and the competitor can 
result in significant errors.  In contrast,  resorcinol  has a similar  reactivity with HOBr than SeMet  at the 
studied pH value (kHOBr+resorcinol = 1.8   107 M−1 s−1; pH 8 ), implying that the apparent  second -order rate 
constant for the reaction of SeMet with  HOBr  determined in the current study is more accurate . To 
exclude that BOC 2O contributed to the observed reactivity (note that BOC 2O was added in a 10 -times 
molar excess relative to Se), we performed additional tests ( section 4.4. 11), indicating that th e 
apparent second -order rate constant for the reaction of HOBr with B OC 2O was around 10 M-1 s-1.  Based 
on this observation, a contribution of the derivatization agent to the overall kinetics can be excluded . 
A significantly higher reactivity ( almost  1 order of magnitude) was observed for the DMSe -HOBr 
reaction in buffered artificial seawater ( kDMSe+HOBr, seaw.  = (4.7±0.5)  108 M-1 s-1 vs. kDMSe+HOBr  = (7.1±0.7) 
 107 M-1 s-1 in ultrapure water ). To test if the ionic strength of seawater could explain  the higher 
reactivity, experiments were carried out in  a perchlorate medium with the same ionic strength (but 
without bromide) as the artificial seawater. Based on these experiments it can be  concluded that ionic 
strength effects as well as a higher Br- concentration contribute to the higher reactivity ( secti on 4.4. 13). 
In contrast, no change in reactivity was observed for the reaction between DMDSe and HOBr when 
comparing ultrapure water with artificial seawater (Table 4.1). We currently do not have an 
explanation, why the behaviors of DMDSe and DMSe differ i n these tests.    Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds

 4.3.3 Se-containing products from the reactions between organoselenium compounds and HOBr  
4.3.3.1 Monos elenides . 
For the reaction between DMSe and HOBr, dimethyl selenoxide was the only identified oxidation 
product by HR -MS (DMSeO; Table 4.2 and Figure S 4.8). The HR -MS signal intensity for DMSeO indicated 
that its formation is complete  at a molar HOBr:DMSe ratio of 1:1 and that for  HOBr:DMSe ratios up to 
10:1 , DMSeO is not further oxidized (Figure 4.2A). In additi on, it was confirmed by SPME -GC/MS 
analysis that DMSe was completely abated at a molar HOBr:DMSe ratio of 1:1 (data not shown). Also , 
LC-ICP-MS/MS analyses indicated a single Se species for the experiment with an initial molar 
HOBr:DMSe ratio of 10:1 (Figures S 4.9 and S4.11) and neither selenite (Se[+IV]) nor selenate (Se[+VI]) 
were detected. Our results are consistent with previous studies using other oxidants (hydrogen 
peroxide [H 2O2], ozone [O 3] and hypochlorous acid [HOCl]), reporting DMSeO as main oxidation 
product.140, 145, 148 Higher oxidized products (i.e., selenones such as dimethyl selenone [DMSeO 2]) were 
only reported in organic solvents with oxidants such as HOCl, potassium permanganate (KMnO 4), and 
others.140, 352  
Similarly,  for the other organic monoselenide compounds , i.e., DPSe or N-acetylated -SeMet , only one 
oxidation product was detected and identified by HR -MS to be  DPSeO  and N-acetylated -SeMetO, 
respectively (Table 4.2 and Figures S 4.12 – S4.13). The HR -MS signal intensities indicated that the ir 
formation were complete at a molar HOBr:Se  compoun d ratio of 1:1 (Figures 4.2B and 4.2C), and  
HPLC/ UV analyses confirmed that at a molar HOBr: Se compound ratio of 1:1, DPSe and N-acetylated -
SeMet were completely consumed (data not shown). Overall, these results demonstrate that the 
oxidation of monoselenides by HOBr proceeds via an oxygen transfer reaction with a 1 :1 stoichiometry 
between HOBr and the studied compounds . 
4.3.3.2 Diselenides . 
The reaction between DMDSe and HOBr yielded methane seleninic acid (MSeIA; Table 4.2), which was 
shown  by both HR -MS (Figure S 4.14) and LC -ICP-MS/MS analyses (Figure S 4.15). The formation of 
MSeIA increased from a molar HOBr:DMDSe ratio of 1:1 to 3:1, and then the MSeIA intensity decreased 
from a ratio of 3:1 to 10:1 (Figure 4.2D). Based on LC -ICP-MS/MS analysis, the MSeIA concentration at 
the molar HOBr:DMDSe 3:1 ratio accounted for the initial DMDSe concentration (Figure S4.17). These 
results agree with stoichiometric experiments  indicating  the consumption of 3 moles HOBr per mole 
of DMDSe  (section 4.4. 12). The decrease of MSeIA  when increasing the molar HOBr:DMDSe ratio from 
3:1 to 10:1 indicates a further reaction of MSeIA with HOBr. While a new Se peak could be observed 
by LC -ICP-MS/MS at a molar HOBr:DMDSe ratio of 10:1 (which did not correspond to Se[+IV] nor 
Se[+VI] ; Figure S 4.15), no other Se -containing compound was detected by HR -MS, apart from DMS eO2 Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
114 
 (Figure S 4.14), which is derived from an impurity in the DMDSe standard. It is likely that this new peak, 
is a more oxidized Se  compound, for instance methane selenonic acid (MSeA, Table 4.2), the Se-analog 
of the S compound “methane sulfonic acid” (MSA). MSeA  may  not be efficiently ionized  under HR -MS 
operating conditions used here and is not commercially available.  
DPDSe and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 were oxidized by HOBr to phenyl seleninic acid (PhSeIA) and N-
acetylated -selenocysteine -seleninic -acid ( N-acetylated -SeCysO 2H), respectively (Table 4.2 and Figures 
S4.18 – S4.21). For DPDSe, an additional product was detected, i.e., methyl phenyl selenone  (MPSeO 2; 
Table 4.2 and Figure S 4.18). PhSeIA, MPSeO 2 and N-acetylated -SeCysO 2H were already detected in 
blank samples of DPDSe and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 (without HOBr addition)  potentially due to their 
formation in the electrospray ionization. The contents of these compounds increased at molar 
HOBr:DPDSe or HOBr: N-acetylated -SeCys 2 ratios of 1: 1 and  3:1 (Figures 4.2E and 4.2F), in line with the 
total consumption of  DPDSe or N-acetylated -SeCys 2 at a molar HOBr:Se  compound ratio of 3:1 
(HPLC/UV analyses not shown). MPSeO 2 may either originate from impurities in DPDSe (e.g. , traces of 
DPSe, which could be oxidized to the selenone at a very high molar excess of HOBr , as observed for 
the DMSe impurity present in the DMDSe solutions) or from DPDSe oxidation as a side product. At 
molar HOBr:DPDSe or HOBr: N-acetylated -SeCys 2 ratios of 10:1,  PhSeIA, MPSeO 2; and N-acetylated -
SeCysO 2H were present in lower quantities as for 3:1 ratios, which could indicate the transformation 
to compound(s) which escaped  detect ion by H R-MS, as was also observed for MSeIA (the oxidation 
product of DMDSe, Figure 4.2D). Furthermore, as for DMDSe, neither Se(+IV) nor Se(+VI) were 
detected by LC -ICP-MS/MS for all investigated molar HOBr:DPDSe ratios. Only for the 3:1 and 10:1 
molar HOBr: N-acetylated -SeCys 2 ratios, a small proportion of Se(+IV) (i.e. <10%) was detected (see 
Figure S 4.20).

Figure 4.2: Semi -quantitative HR -MS data for the identified Se -containing products -and the initial Se -
compounds when detected - of the reactions between HOBr and (A) DMSe, (B) DPSe, (C) N-acetylated -
SeMet, (D) DMDSe, (E) DPDSe and (F) N-acetylated -SeCys 2. All reaction s were performed with variable 
molar HOBr:Se -compound ratios (i.e., 0:1, 1:1, 3:1 and 10:1)  and at pH 8. I nitial concentration s of 
organic Se -compounds were 6.25 µM. The signal intensities are those of the Se -compounds detected 
with  a Na+ adduct.  
4.3.4 Mechanisms for reactio ns between HOBr and the studied  diselenides   
Our results indicate that 3 moles HOBr per mole of diselenide were required for a complete 
consumption of these compounds (i.e., DMDSe, DPDSe and N-acetylated -SeCys 2) (section 4.4.10 ). 
Ther efore, it can be concluded that the second and third oxidation steps with HOBr are faster than the 
initial attack on the diselenides. Based on the obtained average reaction stoichiometry and the kinetics 
of the first oxidation step, we determined second -order rate constants for the second and third 
oxidation steps of the 3 -step reaction by running a kinetic reaction model ( section 4.4. 15).   
Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
117 
 In agreement with the finding that seleninic acids were the end products of reactions between 
diselenides and HOBr (T able 4.2), and  considering the 1:3 reaction stoichiometry, we suggest that the 
diselenide -HOBr reaction proceeds by the tran sfer of 6 electrons (equations 4.1 – 4.3). In this context, 
3 moles of HOBr (Br[+I]) are reduced to Br- (Br[-I]) for 1 mole of  disel enide (2 × Se[-I]) that is oxidized 
to two moles  of seleninic acid (Se[+II]) , according to eqs. 4.1-4.3.  
Reduction: 3 HOBr + 6e- + 3 H+      3 Br- + 3 H 2O     (4.1) 
Oxidation: R -Se-Se-R + 4 H 2O      2 R-SeO-OH + 6e- + 6 H+    (4.2) 
________________________________________________________  
 
Redox: 3 HOBr + R -Se-Se-R + H 2O      3 Br- + 2 R -SeO-OH + 3 H+   (4.3) 
The formation of seleninic acid involves the rupture of the diselenide bond likely due to the weaker 
Se-Se than Se -C bond.353  Seleninic acid was also identified as the main product in other studies that 
investigated the oxidation of diselenides by H 2O2145-147 and O 3.148 Two out of these four studies145, 148 
also reported a 1:3 stoichiometric ratio with a slower initial reaction step followed by faster reactions 
of the oxidi zed interm ediates.  
4.3.5 Comparison of the reactivities of bromine  with selected Se compounds  and analog ous S 
compounds  
The apparent second -order rate constants for the reactions of organic Se compounds with HOBr can 
be compared to the corresponding value s for analog ous S compounds, i.e., DMS, N-acetylated -Met 
and N-acetylated -Cys 2. The apparent  second -order rate constants of the Se  amino acids N-acetylated -
SeMet ( 2.8  108 M-1 s-1) and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 (3.8  107 M-1 s-1) with HOBr exceed the 
corresponding values of the analog ous S-containing compounds N-acetylated -Met (3.6   106 M-1 s-1)99 
and N-acetylated -Cys 2 (3.4  105 M-1 s-1)99 by about 2 orders of magnitude. An enhancement of the 
reactivity of 1 -2 orders of magnitude for organic Se  compounds compar ed to the organic S  compounds 
has also been reported in other studies 106-109 and is often attributed to the higher nucleophilicity and 
polarizability of the Se atom compared to the S atom. Furthermore, in a computational study of the 
influence of different hydrogen, alkyl and aryl substituents and type of chalcogens on oxidation w ith 
H2O2, a lower activation energy is reported for diselenides than for  disulfides.157 According to Bortoli 
et al . (2018) ,157 the type of chalcogen (which acts as a nucleophil e) has a larger effect on reactivity than 
the hydrogen, alkyl and aryl substituent (which contribute to an increase in electron density around 
the chalcogen atom). This is in agreement with the kinetic results from this study (Table 4.1), 
demonstrating  a larger difference between Se - and S -species (about 2 orders of magnitude) than 
between Se compounds with  alkyl - and aryl -substituents (about a factor of 2.1 -5.3).  Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
118 
 However, when comparing DMS and  DMSe the opposite behavior was observed. The apparent second -
order rate constant of 1. 2  109 M-1 s-1 294 for the rea ction between DMS and HOBr exceeds the value 
for the reaction between DMSe  and HOBr by mor e than an order of magnitude. For the experiments 
carried out in a simplified seawater matrix, the reactivity difference is smaller but still differs by a factor 
of 3. Furthermore, it is remarkable that the higher reactivity of DMS compred to  DMSe for the reaction s 
with HOBr ( kDMS+HOBr  > kDMSe+HOBr ) is opposite to  the reactivity of N-acetylated -Met and N-acetylated -
SeMet with HOBr ( kN-acetylated -Met+HOBr < kN-acetylated -SeMet+HOBr ), considering that N-acetylated -Met and N-
acetylated -SeMet are also thio- and selenoethers, respectively. Further studies would be required to 
explain these findings.   
4.3.6 Environmental implications  
In this section, we assess if HOBr  could be a potential sink for the organic Se  compounds DMSe, DMDSe, 
SeMet and SeCys 2, e.g., in marine waters  and/or organisms. To make this assessment, first -order rate 
constants for the DMSe -HOBr reaction were calculated and compared to the kinetics of photochemical 
oxidation  (currently considered as the main DMSe sink).  
With an apparent second -order rate constant of the DMSe -HOBr reaction of 7.1   107 M-1 s-1 (4.7  108 
M-1 s-1 for seawater) at pH 8 (Table 4.1) and an estimated HOBr steady -state concentration of ≈ 3×10-
14 M,294 the calculated first -order rate constant of the DMSe -HOBr reaction is ≈ 2.1  10-6 s-1 (1.4  10-
5 s-1 in synthetic seawater). These values are 1 -2 orders of magnitude lower than the reported first 
order rate constants for DMSe photooxidation (surface degradation) of 18.1 day-1 (= 2.1   10-4 s-1) for 
the open ocean.342 Therefore, in contrast to DMS, it seems that HOBr is generally not a relevant sink 
for marine DMSe. However, when  HOBr and DMSe are produced in the same algal blooms or even in 
the same algal species, as has been reported for HOBr and DMS production,211, 212 the reaction between 
HOBr and DMSe ma y locally and temporarily  be a relevant sink of DMSe.  
Since photodegradation rates and other loss processes for DMDSe, N-acetylated -SeMet and N-
acetylated -SeCys 2 are to the best of our knowledge unknown, the relevance of HOBr as a sink for these 
species is not clear. A lso, for these species, the relevance of their reaction with HOBr depends on the 
factors driving their concentration . In contrast, it is unlikely that SeMet, SeCys 2, DMSe and DMDSe 
affect HOBr concentrations in marine waters, since HOBr in th ese system s preferentially re acts with 
iodide, DOM and DMS .294, 343 For DPSe and DPDSe, which we included in our study as they are aryl -
analogs of DMSe and DMDSe, we do not assume any biological relevance in natural aquatic systems, 
since the y are industrial  compounds.

 4.3.7 Antioxidant properties of Se -contai ning amino acids  
Our results suggest that the antioxidant effects of Se amino acids against HOBr could be substantial.  
SeMet has been reported to be the main form of Se in Se -containing proteins in cells of 
microorganisms,117 and it can thus be assumed to be present at relevant concentrations in biological 
tissues. However,  there is no information on concentrations of free SeMet and SeCys 2 in biological 
tissues . As the  reactivities  and concentrations of other HOBr scavengers are also unknown, a 
quantitative assessment of the contributions of the different antioxida nt effects  is impossible . 
Nevertheless, among all investigated Se  compounds, N-acetylated -SeMet exhibited the highest 
reactivit y towards HOBr, with a n apparent  second -order rate constant of 2.8  108 M-1 s-1.  Since the S -
analog methionine is a well -accepted scavenger for HOBr,99, 344, 354 -357  with a reactivity of about 2 orders 
of magnitude lower than SeMet, it can be hypothesized that SeMet is also a scavenger of HOBr  in 
organisms . Although we cannot determine the relevance of SeMet  and SeCys 2 with respect to HOBr 
quenching  in marine waters a nd biological systems on a quantitative basis, this study supports a 
potential relevance of these compounds as scavengers for HOBr in both environments .

4.4.3 Method for the production of N-acetylated -Selenomethionine and N-acetylated -Selenocystine  
The method used to produce N-acetylated -Selenomethionine ( N-acetylated -SeMet) and N-acetylated -
selenocystine ( N-acetylated -SeCys 2) is described in McCurry et al.  (2016).359 Here,  we used 20 mL 
amber glass vials with screw caps. A solution of 390 mM BOC 2O in methanol was produced in a 10 mL 
headspace amber crimp vial and stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C. 5 mL methanol ( CH 3OH, LC/MS grade, 
Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK ) was added to each vial, followed by the addition of BOC 2O and 
the Se -amino acid to a total volume of 6 mL and a molar BOC 2O:Se ratio of 10:1. Finally, 250 g sodium 
hydrogen carbonate ( NaHCO 3, analytical grade, Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany ) was added to the vial. 
The vial was then placed in beaker half -filled with ultrapure water and sonicated for 30 min in an 
ultrasonic bath (Sonorex Super 10 P, Bandelin electronic GmbH & Co ., Berlin, Germany). The cap of the 
vial was slightly opened to av oid overpressure due to CO 2 formation. After sonication and settling of Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
124 
 solid NaHCO 3, 5 mL of the sonicated N-acetylated -SeMet solution was transferred to a 20 mL amber 
glass vial and mixed with 15 mL H 2O.  The sonicated N-acetylated -SeCys 2 solution was di rectly filtered 
(without dilution with water) through a 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate syringe filter (Whatman, Luer 
connection) and transferred to a 8 mL amber glass vial.  
Stock solutions of N-acetylated -SeMet and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 were then quantified for total Se by 
ICP-MS/MS and the results were in good agreement with the calculated target concentrations (<3% 
deviation). In a separate experiment, the yield of N-acetylation of amines via BOC 2O was tested for 
formation of chloramines ( section 4.4. 4). 
4.4.4 Test for chloramine formation of N-acetylated -SeMet and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 
Chlorination of N-acetylated Se amino acids was performed to examine the effectiveness of the 
derivatization. For fully derivatized amino acids, the amino group can no longer react with HOCl, 
wherefore, the added chlorine remains in solution and can be detected photometric ally by the N,N-
diethyl -p-phenylenediamine  (DPD) method.360 If the amino  acids are not or only partially derivatized, 
chlorine reacts with the amino group and can no longer be measured directly by DPD. However, upon 
addition of iodide, hypoiodous acid is formed, which reacts with DPD.361 Experiments were carried out 
with N-acetylated -SeMet and various doses of HOCl in 10 mL amber glass vials under constant stirring. 
Water and N-acetylated -SeMet (final concentration = 10 µM) were added to the vial. The reaction was 
initiated by the addition of  HOCl (final concentration: 0 -50 µM; total volume = 4 mL). After one minute 
reaction time, 2.5 mL of the reaction solution was transferred to a 1 cm quartz cuvette (Helma 
Analytics, Müllheim, Germany), where 125 µL of a 0.4 M PO 4-buffer solution (containin g 269 µM EDTA 
and 74 µM HgCl 2) and 125 µL of a DPD solution (containing 4.2 mM N,N-diethyl -p-phenylenediamine 
sulfate salt, 537 µM EDTA, 2% H 2SO 4) were previously added. EDTA and HgCl 2 serve to complex metals 
and iodide, respectively and thereby prevent in terferences and potential formation of HOI (via reaction 
between chloramines and iodide).The absorption signal was measured 15 seconds later (to ensure the 
required reaction time and a constant absorption signal) with a Cary Bio 100 UV -vis spectrophotomete r 
(Varian, Palo Alto, California, USA) at λ = 510 nm. Afterwards, a few crystals of potassium iodide (KI, 
Merck, ≥99.5%) were added to the cuvette and dissolved, thereby ensuring that [KI] > [Hg2+]. The 
absorption was then measured again and the obtained signal was compared with the first reading. A 
higher second reading indicates chloramine formation and therefore an incomplete acetylation of the 
amine group. An unaltered signal indicates the absen ce of chloramines and thus unreactive amine 
groups, demonstarting that the N-acetylation procedure was effective.  
Tests for N-acetylated -SeCys 2 were performed similarly to the procedure described for SeMet but 
using a reaction volume of 3.5 mL and a final N-acetylated -SeCys 2 concentration of 4.9 µM.  Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
125 
 No chloramine formation was observed in the experiment with N-acetylated -SeMet, as the signal 
before and after KI -addition is identical (Figure S 4.1A). It is also visible that the difference between 
added HOCl and quantified total chlorine (via oxidized DPD) corresponds exactly to the concentration 
of N-acetylated -SeMet (with a slope of 1 regarding Δtotal chlorine/ Δadded HOCl after the reaction of 
HOCl with Se in the N-acetylated -SeMet). However, for N-acetylate d-SeCys 2 chloramine formation is 
observed which indicates an incomplete N-acetylation of the amino group (Figure S 4.1B). Ca. 20 µM 
HOCl are consumed by N-acetylated -SeCys 2. Quantified total chlorine after KI -addition is up to 3 µM 
(average 1.6 µM) higher c ompared to the first reading. However, the concentration of produced 
chloramine for different HOCl doses (representing the different data points in Figure S 4.1) is 
inconsistent and the fraction of incomplete N-acetylated amino groups is difficult to predic t (2.5 – 58%, 
average: 33%). Despite the still available amino groups in solutions of N-acetylated -SeCys 2, it can be 
excluded that the amino group will influence the kinetics of the reaction between N-acetylated -SeCys 2 
and HOBr, because (i) the reactivity between HOBr and primary amines is around 106 M-1 s-1 at pH 816, 
350  which is 1 -2 orders of magnitude low er than the observed reactivity between HOBr and N-
acetylated -SeCys 2 and (ii) there is no HOBr -reactivity difference reported for methionine and N-
acetylated methionine,16 which points to a  limited influence of the amino group for the overall 
reactivity.

We used deuterated dimethyl sulfide (DMS -d6) as an internal standard for DMSe, as described in 
Vriens et al.  (2015).102  For DMDSe, better results were obtained when its quantification was based on 
counts (without using an internal standard). Concentrations of DPSe, DPDSe, N-acetylated -SeMet , N-
acetylated -SeCys 2, resorcinol and TMB were quantified by HPLC/UV, using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 
HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and a Cosmosil C 18 column ( 3.0 
ID X 100 mm ; Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan).  Separation of DPSe and DPDSe was achieved with an 
isocratic elution using a methanol/10 mM phosphoric acid eluent, whereas N-acetylated -SeMet , N-0.E+001.E+072.E+073.E+074.E+075.E+07

 acetylated -SeCys 2 and resorcinol were separated using a gradient elution, with an acetonitrile/10 mM 
phosphoric acid eluent (Figure S 4.3). For TMB quantification, an acetonitrile/10 mM phosphoric acid 
eluent was used under isocratic conditions (Figure S 4.3). A photodiode array detector ( Dionex  PDA -

TMB at 2 54 nm, 254 nm, 220 nm, 208 nm, 273 nm, and 208 nm, respectively.

The limit of quantification (LOQ) for DMSe and DMDSe were calculated based on standard deviations 
of blanks relative to the calibration slope (Hubaux and Vos formula, equation S 4.2),362 while LOQs for 
DPSe, DPDSe, resorcinol and TMB were calculated based on the noise of the baseline relative to the 
signal of a standard (equation S 4.3). This method was not applied to N-acetylat ed-SeMet and N-020406080100

 4.4.8 Calculation of second -order rate constants for the reactions of organic selenium compounds 
with HOBr  
Results from competition kinetics were analyzed by equations S 4.5 and S 4.6. 363 
Selenium species and resorcinol (for DPDSe: TMB) compete with each other for their reaction with 
HOBr (competition kinetics). Based on the fraction of resorcinol and the Se organic compound that 
reacted with HOBr, a slope is derived:  
ln([𝑆𝑒]
[𝑆𝑒]0) = ln ([𝑅𝑒𝑠 ]
[𝑅𝑒𝑠 ]0) 𝑘𝑎𝑝𝑝 ,𝐻𝑂𝐵𝑟 +𝑆𝑒
𝑘𝑎𝑝𝑝 ,𝐻𝑂𝐵𝑟 +𝑅𝑒𝑠        (S4.5) 
𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒  = 𝑘𝑎𝑝𝑝 ,𝐻𝑂𝐵𝑟 +𝑆𝑒
𝑘𝑎𝑝𝑝 ,𝐻𝑂𝐵𝑟 +𝑅𝑒𝑠         (S4.6) 
where  
 [Se]0 is the initial concentration of the organic Se compound (before reaction)  
 [Se]t is the residual concentration of the organic Se compound (after reaction)  
 [Res]0 is the initial concentration of resorcinol (before reaction)  
 [Res]t is residual concentration of resorcinol (after reaction)  
 kapp(HOBr+Se) is the apparent second -order rate constant for the reaction between HOBr and 
the organic Se compound  
 kapp(HOBr+Res)  is the apparent second -order rate constant for the reaction between HOBr and 
resorcinol   
 
Multiplication of this slope with the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction between 
resorcinol and HOBr results in the apparent second order rate constant ( kapp(Se+HOBr)) of the reaction 
between the organic Se compound and HOBr (eq. S 4.7):  
kapp(HOBr+Se) = slope × kapp(HOBr+Res)        (S4.7) 
kapp(HOBr+Se) was calculated for pH 8 based on the slopes indicated in Table S 4.5 and S 4.6, and 
equation S 4.7.

4.4.10 Identification and (semi)quantification of Se -containing oxidation products by HR -MS  
Preliminary HR -MS analyses demonstrated that the Se -containing oxidation products were either not 
ionized in negative ion mode or were ionized in both negative and positive ion modes (e.g., N-
acetylated -SeMet). All analyses were thus performed in positive ion mode (direct infusion) with the 
following settings: syringe pump flow rate: 10 µL min-1, ESI spray voltage: +3.0 kV; sheath gas flow rate: 
5; capillary temperature: 320 °C; S -lens RF level: 55; automatic gain control: 1 × 106 (maximum 
accumulation time  of 50 ms), and resolution: 240’000. Samples were loaded to the ESI source using

 the instrument’s built -in syringe pump and a Hamilton syringe (500 µL) connected to the ESI source via 
PEEK tubing.  
To identify the Se -containing oxidation products by looking  for the Se isotopic pattern, full mass 
spectra with different m/z ranges (e.g., 60 -1000, 60 -200, 200 -400, 400 -600) were recorded for all 
samples. For the compound identification with the software Freestyle (Thermo Scientific), the “predict 
composition” fu nction was used with a mass tolerance of 5 ppm and allowing for the presence of N, 
O, C, H, S, Cl, P, Na, K, Br and Se. For the semi -quantification of the identified Se -containing oxidation 
products, single ion mode (SIM) spectra at the nominal mass ± 0.2 were recorded.  
The notation of the detected masses of the identified organic Se compounds/oxidation products as 
well as the calculation of the mass accuracy ( Δppm ; equation S 4.8) follow the recommendation by 
Brenton and Godfrey (2010).364

where  
 Δppm represents the mass accuracy (in parts per million) and can be positive  or negative;

4.4.11  Kinetics of the HOBr -BOC 2O reaction  
A decrease of HOBr concentration was observed when it was exposed to BOC 2O. To assess the 
importance of the HOBr -BOC 2O reaction , kinetic experiments under pseudo first -order conditions in 
excess of BOC 2O were performed. BOC 2O was mixed with HOBr in a molar ratio of BOC 2O:HOBr = 20:1. 
Residual HOBr was quenched after different reaction times (60 and 360 s), by transferring 2 mL of the 
reaction solution to a volumetric flask, where 3 mL of an ABTS solution (130 µM ABTS; 40 mM H 2SO 4) 
was previously added. The absorption was measured at λ = 405 nm and converted to a HOBr 
concentration (based on a HOBr -ABTS calibration; ε = 30226 M-1 cm-1).193 Figure S 4.6 shows a plot of ln 
of the relative residual concentration of HOBr as a funct ion of time. The slope of the straight line 
corresponds to the pseudo first -order rate constant. Division of the pseudo first -order rate constant 
by the BOC 2O concentration results in the second -order rate constant of the HOBr -BOC 2O reaction 
(Table S 4.7). 
Figure S 4.6 (blue dotted line) shows that the rate of the HOBr decrease is initially higher, which points 
to an impurity that reacts faster with HOBr than BOC 2O. The determined second -order rate constant 
for the HOBr -BOC 2O reaction is 5.0 M-1 s-1 (orange d otted line, 0 -360 s, Figure S 4.6) and 10.7 M-1 s-1 Chapter 4. Kinetic Se organic compounds  
136 
 (blue dotted line, 0 -60 s, Figure S 4.6). Based on this data set, it can be concluded that BOC 2O is not 
relevant for HOBr consumption for the experimental conditions in this study with a ca. 10 -fold excess 
relative to N-acetylated -Se-amino acid concentrations as the reactivity of studied N-acetylated -Se-
amino acids towards HOBr exceeds the HOBr -BOC 2O reactivity by several orders of magnitude.

4.4.13  Experiments investigating the higher reactivity of DMSe with HOBr in buffered artificial

A separate kinetic experiment for the DMSe -HOBr reaction in buffered artificial seawater without Br- 
(i.e. [PO 4 tot] = 20 mM, [NaCl] = 0.55 M) resulted in a substantially lower DMSe -HOBr reactivity 
(kDMSe+HOBr  = 1.3   108 M-1 s-1) in comparison to the buffered artificial seawater ( k = 4.7±0.5  108, 
containing Br-) but still higher than in the sample with buffered ultrapure water. In another 
experiment, the same ionic strength was applied with perchlorate ([PO 4 tot] = 20 mM, [NaClO 4] = 0.55 
M), which yielded a similar reactivity compared to the Br- free seawater medium ( kDMSe+HOBr  = (2.2 ±0.7)  
 108 M-1 s-1) (Table S 4.6, Figure S 4.5).  The higher slope values (Figure S 4.5) obtained for higher ionic 
strength are not caused by sl ower HOBr -resorcinol kinetics under a higher ionic strength.  A possible 
change of p Ka towards lower values would shift resorcinol speciation towards the more reactive 
deprotonated species ( section 4.4. 5). Based on this, it can be concluded that a higher i onic strength 
contributes to a higher DMSe -HOBr reactivity. However, it is also evident that Br- contributes to a 
B 
 A

 higher reactivity of the DMSe -HOBr reaction, since the reactivity in a Br--containing artificial seawater 
medium ( kDMSe+HOBr  = (5.4 ±0.6)   108 M-1 s-1) is significantly different to the reactivity in a Br--free 
seawater medium ( kDMSe+HOBr  = 1.5   108 M-1 s-1) or in a perchlorate medium ( kDMSe+HOBr  = (2.2 ±0.7)   108 
M-1 s-1). We do not have a reasonable explanation for how Br- enhances the reacti vity. An indirect effect 
of Br- via the formation of other reactive bromine species (e.g. Br 2, via the reaction between Br- and 
HOBr) is not expected to be the reason for the higher observed reactivity of DMSe in buffered artificial 
seawater medium. Concen trations of reactive bromine species  can be calculated based on 
concentrations of halides (i.e. Br-, Cl-), HOBr and H+ used in kinetic experiments (Table S 4.8), and 
equations S 4.9 – S4.11. 
HOBr + Br- + H+     Br2 + H 2O  K = 1.64 ×108 M-2 234   (S4.9) 
HOBr + Cl- + H+          BrCl + H 2O  K = 7692 M-2 235    (S4.10) 
2 HOBr          Br2O + H 2O   K = 6.31 M-1 200    (S4.11) 
Normalization of calculated concentrations of Br 2, BrCl and Br 2O to HOBr concentrations results in their 
respective fractions (Table S 4.9).  
Calculated Br 2 concentrations (based on equation S 4.9) account for only 0.14% of HOBr (Table S 4.9), 
which could increase the observed reactivity in artificial seawater medium compared to the PO 4-
buffered medium by 40% at most, considering an  upper reactivity limit of ≈2  1010 M-1 s-1 for second -
order reactions (diffusion limit). This cannot explain the 6.5 -fold higher reactivity of DMSe in buffered 
artificial seawater medium than PO 4-buffered medium.

 4.4.15  Estimation of second order rate constants for second and third steps of the reactions of 
diselenides with HOBr  
Three oxidation steps (3 moles of HOBr consumed b y 1 mole of diselenide) are required to transform 
a diselenide in two seleninic acids, which is illustrated by the slopes in Figures S 4.7A-C. The kinetics of 
the first oxidation step ( k1) are known from kinetic experiment in this study (Table 4.1). The sec ond ( k2) 
and third ( k3) oxidation steps are expected to have higher second -order rate constants than k1 based 
on the reaction stoichiometry in Figure S 4.7.

A kinetic model for the DMDSe -, DPDSe - and N-acetylated -SeCys 2-reaction with HOBr was established,

constant of the diselenide -HOBr reaction at pH 8 (Table 4.1). The initial diselenide and HOBr 
concentrations were 6.25 and 12.5 µM, respectively. HOBr  was completely consumed in the model

The model parameters for DMDSe, DPDSe and N-acetylated -SeCys 2 are provided in Table S 4.10. 
Modelled values for k2 and k3 are shown in Figure S 4.23. k2 and k3 for the DMDSe -HOBr reaction are

Conclusions and Outlook  
5.1 Conclusions  
5.1.1 Fast reaction between DMS and HOBr and its role as a sink for marine DMS  
Our kinetic experiments demonstrated a very high reactivity between the marine organic sulfur 
compound dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and the marine bromine species hypobromous acid (HOBr). In 
kinetic batch experiments, using competition kinetics, the second -order rate constant of the DMS -
HOBr reaction was determined to be 1.6   109 M-1 s-1. This reactivity is clos e to the diffusion limit and 
ca. 2 -3 orders of magnitude higher compared to the reactivity of HOBr with the structurally related 
thioether methionine. This result may be astonishing, but not exceptional considering that HOBr reacts 
selectively and fast wit h nucleophilic compounds (e.g. phenols , inorganic anions such as sulfite and 
iodide ). Also, the previously reported DMS reactivity with chlorine  (i.e., hypochlorous acid, HOCl) (2.6  
 109 M-1 s-1) is even higher than the reactivity between HOBr and DMS determined in this study. Kinetic 
batch and diffusion -reactor experiments, including dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a potential 
competitor for DMS showed that the reaction between DMS and HOBr is  fast, even in the presence of 
a molar excess of highly reactive phenolic moieties  in DOM . These experiments showed that the 
formation of bromoform (CHBr 3) was suppressed in the presence of DMS. Furthermore, at naturally 
relevant DMS:DOM concentration rati os, DMS was almost entirely transformed to DMSO by HOBr. In 
a kinetic model that was applied  to study the effect of the DMS -HOBr reaction  on DMS and CHBr3 
concentrations for a wide range of  DMS and HOBr fluxes (10-13 M s-1 – 10-9 M s-1), it could be shown 
that HOBr fluxes typical for blooms can reduce marine DMS concentration s by half in comparison to 
the absen ce of  HOBr. The calculated first -order degradation rate of the reaction between HOBr and 
DMS (3   10-5 s-1) is of the same order of magnitude as known major DMS sinks. In contrast to  DMS 
fluxes typical for blooms can reduce CHBr 3 formation by up to 80% in comparison to the absence of  
DMS. Therefore, the reactivity between DMS and HOBr should be considered in ocean biogeochemical 
models  to predict t he DMS and CHBr 3 fluxes to the atmosphere . 
 
 Chapter 5. Conclusions and Outlook  
155 
 5.1.2 Much slower kinetic s for the reaction of  HOBr with DMSO and other small organic S species  
Contrary to DMS, its oxidation product DMSO reacts much slower with HOBr to DMSO 2 (k’’DMSO +HOBr = 
0.4 M-1 s-1). Therefore, this reaction is not relevant for the fate of DMSO and the formation of further 
oxidized S  species. DMSP, MSA and DMSO 2 were even found to be unreactive towards HOBr  (k’’ < 0.1 
M-1 s-1).  
5.1.3 Fast reactions of HOBr with organic selenium compou nds, but DMSe reacts slower with HOBr 
than DMS  
All organic Se compounds investigated in this study had a high reactivity towards HOBr, with second - 
order rate constants between 6   106 – 3  108 M-1 s-1. Monoselenic compounds (i.e. DMSe, DPSe, N-
acetylated -SeMet) reacted in a stoichiometric 1:1 ratio with HOBr, whereas diselenides (i.e. DMDSe, 
DPDSe and N-acetylated -SeCys 2) reacted in a 1:3 ratio with HOBr, which implies that the secondary 
and tertiary oxidation step s are faster than the primary oxidation . Of all investigated compounds, N-
acetylated -SeMet showed the highest reactivity towards HOBr ( k’’HOBr - N-acetylated -SeMet = 3.2   107 M-1 s-
1), followed by DMSe ( k’’HOBr -DMSe = 8.0   107 M-1 s-1). This is contrary to the reactivity of HOBr with the 
analog S  species (methionine and DMS), where a higher reactivity was determined for DMS ( k’’HOBr -DMS 
= 1.6   109 M-1 s-1) than for methionine ( k’’HOBr -Met 4  106 M-1 s-1). The lower kinetics of the reaction 
between HOBr and DMSe than between HOBr and DMS (i.e. 8.0   107 M-1 s-1 vs 1.6   109 M-1 s-1) 
contrasts with the other selenoether -thioether couple, i.e., selenomethionine -HOBr versus the 
methionine -HOBr reactivity (i.e. 3.2   108 M-1 s-1 vs 4  106 M-1 s-1). Previous scientific studies reported 
consistently higher second -order rate constants for reduced Se than S compounds .  
Contrary to DMS, DMSe has an increased reactivity in seawater medium ([NaCl] = 0.55 M; [KBr] = 840 
µM) ( k’’HOBr -DMSe = 5.4   108 M-1 s-1) when it is exposed to HOBr due to potential faster reactions with 
Br2 (Br 2 is produced via reaction of HOBr with Br-). However, this rate constant is still lower compared 
to the rate constant of the DMS -HOBr reaction, both in ultrapure  and seawater medium. Therefore, it 
is not expected tha t HOBr (together with other reactive Br -species in seawater) plays a significant role 
in marine DMSe degradation as it was demonstrated for marine DMS degradation. Also for the other 
tested organic Se  species (i.e. DMDSe, SeMet, SeCys 2) a reaction with HOB r is likely not relevant in 
terms of their degradation . However, as other sinks for marine Se  species are still rarely reported , the 
relevance of reactions between these Se -species and HOBr  is currently unclear . It is also unlikely that 
the studied Se spec ies will affect HOBr concentrations due to their low concentrations in marine 
waters.

 5.1.4 Potential role of Se -amino acids (SeMet, SeCys 2) in the neutralization of HOBr in biological 
tissues  
The role of organic Se species in neutralizing reactive oxygen  species (ROS) is extensively reported in 
the scientific literature. The fast reactivity of SeMet with HOBr, ( k’’SeMet -HOBr = 3.2   108 M-1 s-1) indicates 
that this Se -amino acid may also represent an important scavenger of HOBr in biological tissues and 
thus potentially reduces the oxidative s tress caused by HOBr production. H owever, it needs to be 
noted that only reactivity of free SeMet was studied and that SeMet incorporated in proteins has not 
been assessed in this study.  
Furthermore, the reactivity a nd reaction stoichiometry of SeCys 2 with HOBr indicates another potential 
HOBr neutralizing system. Via its reaction with HOBr, SeCys 2 consumes 3 HOBr molecules as a result of 
faster secondary and tertiary reactions than the primary reaction. This underlin es the antioxidative 
properties of the SeCys -SeCys 2 system, considering also the previously discussed fast oxidat ion of 
SeCys to SeCys 2.  
5.1.5 Selenoxides as products of monoselenide oxidation, seleninic acids as products of diselenide 
oxidation and comparison to analog S  species  
In analogy to the DMSO formation by the DMS -HOBr reaction, DMSe oxidation by HOBr resulted in 
DMSeO formation. Contrary to DMSO, which can be further oxidized to DMSO 2, analog selenones were 
not found. Instead, DMSeO was the final product. Also the other monoselenides (i.e. DPSe and N-
acetylated -SeMet) were oxidized to the corresponding selenoxide. For the oxidation of diselenides, we 
observed the corresponding seleninic acid as the major product, with  the highest yield for a molar 
HOBr: diselenide = 3:1 ratio. For higher HOBr excess concentrations ( HOBr:diselenide = 10:1), seleninic 
acids were further oxidized to product s which could not be identified.  
The identified products of S - and Se -reactions with HOBr are consistent wit h our investigated 
stoichiometric experiments and are also in agreement with the scientific literature, reporting DMSO 
and DMSO 2 as DMS oxidation products, DMSeO as the product of DMSe oxidation and seleninic acid 
as the product of diselenide oxidation.

5.2 Outlook  
The studies presented in this thesis reveal new insights into the reactivities of organic S and Se 
compounds with HOBr, but also leave some unresolved questions. Further studies are necessary in 
order to (i) reduce uncertainty of results and findings in this study and (ii) to test whether our 
investigated reactions are also important in other systems than the marine environment (e.g. the 
atmosphere or biological systems) and for other conditions (e.g. for future clim ate conditions).  
 It would be p articularly beneficial to have more accurate knowledge about the HOBr fluxes 
from algal cells. Only few studies have reported algal HOBr fluxes. More data on HOBr fluxes 
from various marine algae and other marine organisms wou ld reduce the uncertainty related 
to marine HOBr fluxes and concentrations. More specifically, such data would help to narrow 
down the range of estimated marine HOBr concentrations, which would reduce the 
uncertainty of first -order degradation rates of mar ine DMS via its reaction with HOBr and 
improve the assessment of the relevance of HOBr as a sink for marine DMS.  
 Related to the question how relevant HOBr is as a sink for marine DMS, also the reaction 
between hypoiodous acid (HOI) and DMS needs to be take n into account. The reaction of HOBr Chapter 5. Conclusions and Outlook  
160 
 with iodide (I-) is one of the pathways for HOI production . Therefore, the production of HOI is 
related to HOBr production. HOI in seawater is estimated to be present in the nanomolar 
range. In order to better understan d the role of HOI in the degradation of marine DMS, it would 
be important to determine second -order rate constant for the reaction between HOI and DMS. 
A relevant DMS degradation via the HOI -DMS reaction would warrant further studies on the 
production and fate of HOI and the potential involvement of HOBr.  
 Furthermore, it would be important to study the reactivity between HOBr and DMS under 
atmospheric conditions as aqueous -phase reactions contribute significantly to the f ate of 
atmospheric DMS (Figure 5.1 ).181 As HOBr is produced via atmospheric processes,36, 365, 366 it 
potentially also reacts with DMS in the atmospher e and could thereby contribute to the 
aqueous oxidation of DMS to DMSO.  
 A next step in studying the reactivity between DMS and HOBr could be to perform biotic 
experiments, e.g., studying algae that are known as DMS and/or HOBr producers. Such 
experiments can be seen as a continuation of the diffusin -reactor experiments and would 
reflect natural conditions even better. Biotic experiments could be implemented under 
favorable DMS and HOBr producing conditions (e.g. high light intensities, supporting oxidative 
stress conditions), or conditions simulating future climate condition s (i.e. nitrogen limitation, 
higher temperature, lower pH). Although such experiments are more complex than abiotic 
experiments, e.g., due to irregular biological DMS and HOBr production or other unknown 
environmental factors controlling DMS and HOBr react ivity, the transformation of DMS into 
DMSO and production of CHBr 3 could be tested as a function of varying DMS fluxes. As an 
example, DMS fluxes can be regulated by using low -DMS or high -DMS producing algae or by 
controlling the DMSP -lyase activity.  
 As w e observed fast reactions between HOBr and several organic Se compounds, particularly 
for the amino acid SeMet and the faster secondary and tertiary reactions of diselenides (e.g. 
for the Se amino acid SeCys 2), it would be beneficial to study these reactio ns with biologically 
relevant concentrations of these compounds. With the Se -HOBr reactivity data provided in this 
thesis, the role of the Se amino acids in scavenging HOBr could be quantitatively compared to 
other HOBr -scavenging species. These studies wo uld allow to determine the relative 
contribution of Se amino acids in neutralizing HOBr. Similar considerations could be made for 
other oxidants, as long as data about concentrations and reactivities are available. It should be 
considered that the reactivi ty of free amino acids is likely different than when these are 
incorporated into proteins. Such an approach would expand our knowledge of how organic Se Chapter 5. Conclusions and Outlook  
161 
 species behave as a HOBr -scavenger in environmental and biological systems and their 
significance.  
 
Figure 5.1 : DMS oxidation in marine waters and the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, DMS can be 
oxidized via gas -phase reactions (hydrogen -abstraction to SO 2 and further to H 2SO 4 or oxygen -addition) 
and aqueous -phase reactions to DMSO. DMSO is further oxidized via aqueous -phase reactions to MSIA 
and MSA. The high solubility of HOBr and its fast reaction with DMS raises the question whether the 
HOBr -DMS reaction might also be relevant for DMS in the atmosphere. The HOBr -DMS reaction may 
increase the fraction of p roduced DMSO and therefore favor the oxidation pathway leading to MSA.  
According to Hoffmann et al. (2016),181 complemented by potential reactions with HOBr. Reactions 
with HOBr are shown in red. Aqueous -phase reactions have a blue background. Dominant reaction 
pathways have a wide  arrow.
