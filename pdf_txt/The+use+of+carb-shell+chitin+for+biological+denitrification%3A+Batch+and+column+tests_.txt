Crab-shell chitin was evaluated as a multifunctional substrate for treating acid mine drainage (AMD) in
both batch-microcosms and continuous-ﬂow column tests. In microcosms, crab-shell chitin was able totreat AMD from three different sites with similar results: pH increased from 3.5 to /C247.5 within 2 days;
alkalinity increased at a rate of 37.9 ± 2.2 mg CaCO
3/L day; and sulfate was reduced at a rate of
/C013 :6/C62:6m gS O2/C0
4=L day. In columns, a hydraulic retention time of 11.2 h was enough to raise the
pH from 3.5 to /C247.5. Alkalinity increased at a rate of 50 ± 20 mg CaCO 3/day, and lasted throughout the
duration of the test (125 days, 268 pore volumes (PV)) without showing signs of exhaustion. Metals(Al, Fe, and Mn) were completely removed for 171 PV, and geochemical modeling indicates that theylikely precipitated as insoluble hydr(oxides), sulﬁdes, and carbonates. Manganese and iron breakthroughs
occurred after 174 and 234 PV, respectively, whereas aluminum breakthrough was never observed. These
results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that crab-shell chitin can completely remove metals and neutralizethe pH of AMD under continuous-ﬂow conditions.

1. Introduction
One of the most serious environmental concerns of mining
activity is the production of mine impacted water (also known as
acid mine drainage (AMD)). This is a recurring problem around
the world, especially in some speciﬁc areas of United States,
including Pennsylvania (PADEP, 2000 ). AMD occurs when pyrite
and other sulﬁde minerals are exposed to air and water. Atmo-spheric oxygen rapidly oxidizes pyrite releasing large amounts of
sulfuric acid and ferric iron, which precipitates as ferric hydroxide
or ‘‘yellow boy” (Eq. (1)):

The typical high acidity of AMD can also promote the dissolution of
metals such as Zn, Cu, Cd, As, Ni, and Pb, from other minerals ( Cocos
et al., 2002; Gibert et al., 2003). The resulting acidic and metal con-
taminated streams can adversely impact humans and wildlife.
Remediation of AMD requires three different processes: the
addition of a neutralizing agent, the reduction of sulfate concentra-
tions, and the removal of dissolved metals. Traditional treatment of
AMD involves ex situ chemical processes by the addition of an
alkaline agent and/or sulﬁde to promote the precipitation of the
metals as hydroxides, carbonates, or sulﬁdes. Due to the very highcost of this type of treatment, alternative, in situ and low-tech
treatments have been investigated. They include the use of lime-
stone channels and drains, aerobic wetlands, vertical ﬂow wet-
lands, and permeable reactive barriers (Johnson and Hallberg,
2005; Gibert et al., 2002 ). Anaerobic processes offer the advantage
of allowing the three necessary processes for AMD remediation tooccur almost simultaneously. They rely on the activity of sulfate
reducing bacteria (SRB, Eqs. (2) and (3) ):

where CH 2O represents an organic substrate, and Me2+represents a
divalent metal. The selection of an appropriate organic substrate to
support SRB has important impacts on both operational costs and
the overall biological performance ( Gibert et al., 2002 ). Numerous
fermentable waste materials have been used as substrates withgood results. Researchers have noticed that a mixture of a variety
of materials leads to better performance ( Neculita et al., 2007;
Gibert et al., 2002 ). It has been also reported that low nitrogen
availability can limit the growth of SRB and thereby decrease sulfate
reduction rates ( Waybrant et al., 1998; El Bayoumy et al., 1999 ). A
C:N ratio between 10 and 16 has been proposed as optimum for SRB
activity ( Neculita et al., 2007; Cocos et al., 2002 ), with a maximum
of 45:1–120:1 recommended to prevent a signiﬁcant decrease inSRB activity due to growth limitations in a nitrogen-starved
environment ( Gibert et al., 2004 ). Excessively high nitrogen concen-
trations (>600 mg/L as N) are to be avoided, however, as they can

have a toxic effect on the SRB community ( El Bayoumy et al., 1999 ).
In addition, SRB require an environmental pH between 5 and 8 for
efﬁcient metabolism ( Willow and Cohen, 2003 ). Although the sul-
fate reduction reaction consumes some acidity, limestone chipsare traditionally added in both laboratory and ﬁeld studies to fully
satisfy this pH requirement ( Neculita et al., 2007; Gibert et al.,
2002 ). Other practical considerations that need to be addressed in
the selection of the substrate include the use of a bulky material
with stable porosity to prevent major head losses and/or clogging,and slow degradability to ensure acceptable longevity ( Johnson
and Hallberg, 2005 ). In summary, an ideal substrate for passive
AMD bioremediation will need to possess several characteristics
to support SRB activity: provision of required nutrients, buffering
capacity, and long-lasting supply of electron donor.
Chitin (a linear polysaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine) is, after
cellulose, the second most abundant biopolymer in nature, with an
estimated yearly production of several gigatons (Beaney et al.,
2005; Howard et al., 2003; Percot et al., 2003 ). It is naturally pro-
duced by arthropods (insects and crustaceans), mollusks, and fun-gi. For commercial use, chitin is mainly extracted from crustacean
shells, especially crab and shrimp, which are waste products of the
seafood industry. Crab-shell chitin can be purchased for $0.20/lb
(dewatered)–$0.60/lb (dried) (JRW Bioremediation). In crusta-
ceans, chitin is associated with high levels of calcium carbonate
(CaCO
3, the same mineral found in limestone), which enhances
the strength of their shells ( Percot et al., 2003 ). The nitrogen con-
tent of chitin is also quite high (C 8H13NO 5, indicating a C:N ratio
of 6.9 on mass basis). Recent studies have shown that the degrada-tion of chitin creates reducing conditions that can promote and
sustain anaerobic, reductive processes (Vera et al., 2001; Brennan
et al., 2006; Robinson-Lora and Brennan, 2009 ). The fermentation
of crab-shell chitin has been shown to produce volatile fatty acids(VFAs: predominantly acetate, with lesser amounts of butyrate,
propionate, and formate), some alcohols, and ammonium, resulting
in an overall bioavailable C:N of 5–20. The short chain organic
compounds can be easily used by SRB as electron donors, while
the nitrogen supply falls within the optimum range for SRB activ-
ity. This makes chitin a suitable organic substrate for the growth of
SRB, and suggests that it could be used as a fractional amendment
to other, nitrogen-poor substrates to enhance their effectiveness.
Additionally, the presence of CaCO
3in the crab shell can provide
the required buffering capacity for the rapid recovery of alkalinity
in acidic waters, without the traditional addition of limestone. The
solid nature of crab-shell chitin makes it easy to be delivered
in situ , while its particle size and non-swelling nature help to main-
tain porosity and prevent clogging in continuous-ﬂow systems(Brennan, 2003 ).
It has been shown that chitinous materials can be effectively
used for AMD remediation (Daubert and Brennan, 2007 ), and this
is likely due to its ability to simultaneously serve as an electron do-nor source (VFAs), nitrogen source (ammonium), and neutralizing
agent (CaCO
3) to sustain SRB activity. The aim of this study is to
further evaluate the characteristics and performance of raw crab-shell chitin for the remediation of AMD. Speciﬁcally, remediation
rates (i.e. the removal of metals, sulfate, and acidity, and the gen-
eration of alkalinity) using crab-shell chitin were quantiﬁed under
different raw water characteristics from three AMD sites (micro-
cosm tests) and under continuous-ﬂow conditions (column test).
2. Methods
2.1. Chemicals
All chemicals used in this study were reagent grade or better.
Ultra High Purity nitrogen gas (UHPNG) and Argon gas wereprovided by MG Industries (Malvern, PA). ChitoRem
/C210SC-20 (min-
imally processed crab shell), derived from Dungeness crab (JRW
Bioremediation, LLC, Lenexa, KS), was used as the chitin source.
To evaluate its composition, demineralization and deproteinization
of SC-20 were conducted based on protocols described in previous
studies ( Beaney et al., 2005; Cira et al., 2002; Percot et al., 2003 ).
Results indicate that SC-20 contains /C2410% chitin (C 8H13NO 5),
/C2412% protein (C 16H24O5N4), and /C2478% mineral matter (35% as
CaO). Before experiments, the SC-20 chitin was dry- and thenwet-sieved (with deionized water) using a 40 mesh sieve to re-
move ﬁne particles. The remaining chitin was dried overnight at
50/C176C. The particle size of the resulting material ranged between
5 and 0.425 mm. Silica sand (16–20 mesh, Badger Mining Corp.,Berlin, WI) was used as supplementary packing material in the col-
umn test. Extractable levels of aluminum, iron, and manganesefrom the packing sand corresponded to 16.2, 12.0, and 1.6 mg/kg,
respectively (Mehlich 3 extraction, Agricultural Analytical Services
Laboratory at The Pennsylvania State University).
2.2. Water and sediment sources
The AMD samples and associated benthic sediments (microbial
source) that were used in the microcosm test were obtained from
three different streams within the Snow Shoe area (Centre County,
PA): Beech Creek (BC), North Fork (NF), and Cherry Run (CR) (Table
1). Sediments were collected in sterile centrifuge tubes, trans-
ported at 4 /C176C, and used the same day of sampling. Inﬂuent water
for the column test was obtained from Cherry Run and from Kittan-
ning Run in Altoona, PA. The source of column inﬂuent water was
changed from Cherry Run to Kittanning Run at t= 102 days due to
inclement weather. Before use, the water was purged with UHPNGfor 2 h to ensure a ﬁnal DO 60.5 mg/L. Anoxic water was sampled
and analyzed for redox potential (ORP), pH, electrical conductivity(EC), chloride, sulfate, ammonium, dissolved metals, and volatile
fatty acids (VFAs). Sediments were drained to remove excess water
and obtain a more solid material, and then measured for water
content ( Table 1 ).
2.3. Microcosm test setup
For each AMD site, a set of 40 serum bottles (160 mL capacity,
non-sterile) was prepared. All bottles were supplied with 1.0 g

20 chitin was added. The bottles with SC-20 chitin were labeled as
‘‘actives”, and those without chitin were labeled as ‘‘controls”. The
bottles were purged for 10 min with UHPNG before and after add-
ing 120 mL anoxic AMD. The bottles were sealed with Teﬂon stop-
pers and aluminum crimp tops, manually shaken to ensure
homogeneity, and incubated in dark at room temperature
(20 ± 1 /C176C) for 20 days. During the incubation period, all micro-
cosms were shaken by hand about once daily and duplicate bottlesof ‘‘controls” and ‘‘actives” were sacriﬁced every day during the
ﬁrst 5 days and then every 2–5 days depending on the observed
rate of treatment. After each bottle was opened, samples were
promptly tested for ORP, pH, electrical conductivity (<0.5 h), alka-
linity, acidity, and sulﬁde (<4 h). Another portion of the sample was
ﬁltered (0.20
lm) before being stored for future analyses (4 /C176C for
less than a week for anions and ammonium, 4 /C176C with 0.2 mL/L
conc. HNO 3for dissolved metals, and /C010/C176C for VFAs).
2.4. Column test setup
Three identical columns were constructed using 3.81 cm
diameter by 121.9 cm long clear PVC tubes with PVC caps afﬁxed
to both ends. Each column was equipped with three lateral sam-
pling ports spaced evenly along its length (every 30.48 cm), as
well as an efﬂuent port, to enable the discrete measurement of
chemical degradation proﬁles. All parts were washed with liquid
detergent (Liqui-Nox/C210) and tap water, and then rinsed with milli-
Q water and air dried before assembling. Inﬂuent AMD wasstored in a 50-L plastic carboy (Nalgene) and continuously bub-
bled with Argon gas to keep it under anoxic conditions. Before
packing, the columns were also ﬂushed with Argon gas. Using a
wet packing procedure with anoxic AMD, the ﬁrst quarter of
the columns (30.48 cm) was packed as follows. About 30 g sand
were placed in the bottom of each column to serve as a support
for the packing material. For the two replicate active columns,
the packing material consisted of a mixture of 25 g of pre-
washed SC-20, 50 g of sediment, and approximately 500 g of
sand. For the control column, the packing material consisted of
a mixture of 50 g sediment and approximately 565 g of sand.
After the packing procedure, the columns were left to incubate
stagnant for 8 days. During this incubation period, samples
(/C2425 mL) were taken from the ﬁrst lateral port and tested for
sulfate to monitor the SRB activity. Following the incubation per-iod, the empty portion of the columns was packed with sand
only, by means of wet packing procedure with anoxic AMD. Inﬂu-
ent water was then continuously pumped through the columns
at a ﬂow rate of 0.25 mL/min, equivalent to a Darcy velocity of
0.32 m/day, by means of a peristaltic pump consisting of a digitaldrive and a 4-roller cartridge pump head (Masterﬂex L/S, Cole
Parmer). The approximate pore volume in each column was
540 mL. Sodium chloride tracer tests were conducted to deter-
mine the hydraulic characteristics in all columns. Results indicate
that the three columns had very similar characteristics, behaving
as plug-ﬂow reactors with low dispersion (d < 0.015) and an aver-
age retention time of 44.8 ± 1.6 h. The columns were operated for125 days. Samples ( /C2420 mL) were taken periodically from the
inﬂuent reservoir, the lateral ports (at 30.48 and 60.96 cm fromthe inﬂuent), and the efﬂuent port using a 20-mL plastic syringe.
After the pH was measured, a portion of the sample (7 mL for the
active columns and 10 mL for the control column) was reserved
for alkalinity and acidity titrations and the remaining was ﬁltered
(0.20
lm) before being stored for future analyses (4 /C176C for less
than a week for anions and ammonium, 4 /C176C with 0.2 mL/L conc.
HNO 3for dissolved metals, and /C010/C176C for VFAs). Periodically,
independent samples for sulﬁde were taken from the efﬂuentport and immediately analyzed.2.5. Analytical methods
Electrodes were used to measure ORP (platinum electrode, OR-
ION 9778 BN), pH (Accumet
/C210BASIC, AB15 connected to a Thermo-
ORION pH probe), EC (Thermo-ORION 105A+), and ammoniumconcentrations (ISE ORION 9512). Alkalinity and acidity were mea-
sured by titrations with 0.02 N H
2SO4and NaOH, respectively,
according to the procedure described in Standard Methods (APHA,2005 ). The titration end points were 4.5 and 8.3 for alkalinity and
acidity, respectively. Chloride and sulfate ions were measuredusing an Ion Chromatograph (IC, Dionex DX-100), the analytical
procedure for which is described elsewhere (APHA, 2005 ). Dis-
solved metal concentrations were measured by inductively cou-pled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP, Leeman Labs
PS3000UV) at the Materials Characterization Laboratory at ThePennsylvania State University. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were
determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC,
Waters 2695) as described by Robinson-Lora and Brennan (2009) .
The methylene blue spectrophotometric method (APHA, 2005 )
was used to measure the concentration of sulﬁde. Moisture content
in sediments was determined gravimetrically, according to the
procedure described in Standard Methods (APHA, 2005 ).
The SRB population in the sediment inoculum was estimated
following the most probable number (MPN) method by culturing
samples in Modiﬁed Baar’s Medium (Atlas, 2005 ), using acetate
(not lactate) as substrate (for details, see Electronic Annex 1 in
the online version of this article). The use of acetate ensured the
enumeration of SRB capable of utilizing this compound, which is
the main product of chitin degradation.
Statistical analyses of the collected data were performed using
MINITAB
/C210statistical software (Minitab Inc., State College, PA).
The geochemical computer program PHREEQC (Parkhurst andAppelo, 1999 ) was used to estimate the saturation indexes (SI) of
several aluminum, iron, and manganese phases.
3. Results
3.1. Microcosm test
A very rapid pH increase was observed in all chitin-amended
bottles (actives, Fig. 1 A). Circumneutral pH was achieved after only
2 days of treatment, and continued to increase until it reached a
plateau around pH 7.5 after 7 days. No signiﬁcant differences in
pH were observed among the three treated AMD sets (
a= 0.05).
In the control bottles, pH remained unchanged throughout theexperiment, except for the site CR, for which pH increased by
one unit on average.
Beginning on the ﬁrst day of treatment, alkalinity was steadily
generated while acidity was removed over time in bottles contain-
ing chitin (Fig. 1 B and C). No signiﬁcant differences were found in
these parameters among the three AMD sets at each sacriﬁcialevent (
a= 0.05). Average rates for alkalinity production and acidity
removal corresponded to 37.9 and /C027.5 mg CaCO 3/L day, respec-
tively. Parallel to alkalinity, a steady increase in calcium concentra-
tion at a rate of 34.5 mg/L day was observed during the ﬁrst 9 days
of treatment, when a plateau of 217 mg/L was reached (see Elec-
tronic Annex 2 ). Electrical conductivity also steadily increased in
active microcosms, reaching a maximum of 1632 ± 115 lS/cm by
the end of the test (see Electronic Annex 2 ). No signiﬁcant differ-
ences were found in the ﬁnal levels of these four parameters
among the three AMD sets ( a= 0.05).
Based on triplicate MPN analysis, average estimates of the ini-
tial acetate-utilizing SRB population in the sediment used as a
microbial source was 14 /C2103,1 2/C2103, and 18 /C2104cells per
gram (on a dry basis) for sites BC, NF, and CR, respectively. ChangesM.A. Robinson-Lora, R.A. Brennan / Bioresource Technology 100 (2009) 5063–5071 5065in sulfate concentration were insigniﬁcant during the ﬁrst 7 days of
treatment (coefﬁcient of variance <10%). The activity of the SRB
started to be evident after this period (Fig. 1D). Sulfate was almost
completely removed in two of the three evaluated sites (>90% in NFand CR), while in the other site (BC) about 60% of the initial sulfate
was removed. Sulfate reduction rates, calculated using data from
day 9 to day 20, varied from /C011.9 to /C016:5m gS O
2/C0
4=L day
(p60.01). Based on the mass of substrate, these sulfate reduction
rates were /C023.7 to /C031:1m gS O2/C0
4=L day g chitin. Similarly, sul-
ﬁde accumulation started to be evident after 7 days of treatment.In addition to the characteristic rotten-egg smell of hydrogen sul-
ﬁde, the formation of black precipitates (possibly FeS) was ob-
served. By the end of the test, accumulated dissolved sulﬁde
concentrations ranged between 6.5 and 18.5 mg/L (see Electronic
Annex 2 ). No signiﬁcant changes were observed in the concentra-
tion of sulfur species in the microcosms used as controls (data
not shown). The development of reducing conditions in active
microcosms was also associated with a decrease in ORP values.
During the ﬁrst 5 days of treatment, ORP rapidly decreased from387 ± 87 mV to /C0148 ± 33 mV (see Electronic Annex 2 ). Later
changes were slower, reaching a minimum of /C0271 ± 36 mV by
the end of the experiment.
While no ammonium or fatty acids were detected in the con-
trols, important quantities of these species were observed to accu-
mulate in the active bottles containing crab-shell chitin. The
release of these species followed a very similar pattern in all the
evaluated sites. Ammonium accumulation started to be evident
after 2 days of treatment, and then steadily increased, reaching val-
ues between 48 and 68 mg N/L by the end of the test (see Elec-
tronic Annex 2 ). A rapid release of formate was observed at the
beginning of the test, ranging in concentration from 9.5 to
13 mg/L after only 1 day of treatment. This compound, however,
rapidly disappeared after few days, and was replaced with a con-
tinuous accumulation of acetate, which was the predominant fatty
acid throughout the remainder of the test. Concentrations of ace-
tate at the end of the microcosm experiment ranged from 4.1 to
5.8 mM (250 to 350 mg/L). Other acids, mainly butyrate and propi-onate, were also detected, but their concentrations were signiﬁ-cantly lower than those observed for acetate (0.2–0.4 mM or
10–35 mg/L).
Metal (Fe, Mn, and Al) analyses were also performed during this
microcosm test. However results did not show a speciﬁc removal
pattern (data not shown). It is possible that micro-oxic conditions
(due to the presence of trace DO) in the bottles led to iron oxida-
tion and precipitation, which may have also promoted the removal
of other metals. Deposition of orange particles was observed on the
walls of the bottles, supporting this hypothesis.
3.2. Column test
During the initial stagnant incubation period, a rapid increase in
pH was observed in all columns. After 4 days of incubation, the pH
increased from 3.5 to 7.5 in active columns, while in the control
column, the pH reached a maximum value of 6.3 (Fig. 2 ). A signif-
icant (>50%) decrease in sulfate concentrations was observed in allcolumns during this initial stage of incubation, however this obser-vation is attributed to low-pH interferences with the analytical
procedure (discussion follows), rather than to biological activity.
After 5 days of incubation sulfate reduction was detected only in
the active columns, and sulfate was completely removed by 8 days
of incubation (Fig. 2 ). In active columns, a rapid accumulation of
ammonium and VFAs, as well as alkalinity generation and acidityremoval, were also observed during this period. Maximum concen-
trations of 840 mg NH
þ
4-N=L, 2000 mg C/L from VFAs, and
4610 mg/L alkalinity as CaCO 3were reached at the end of the incu-
bation period (8 days). No ammonium, VFAs, or alkalinity were de-
tected in samples from the control column (Fig. 2), indicating a lack
of microbial activity.
At the beginning of continuous-ﬂow operation, values of all
measured parameters in the two active columns were very similar.It was also observed that samples taken from the three different
sampling ports along the length of each column (actives and con-
trol) had very similar characteristics. This was an indication that
a retention time of only 11.2 h was necessary to produce the345678pHactive-BC

that the electron donor source (SC-20 chitin) was placed only
within the ﬁrst section of each column. For this reason, only data
from the ﬁrst sampling port will be presented here.
After 25 days of continuous operation, a signiﬁcant decrease in
the ﬂow rate in one of the active columns (Column 2) was detected.
The new ﬂow rate was 50% lower than the original and kept slowly
decreasing over time. The presence of gas accumulation was also
observed, preventing sampling in some occasions. After 81 days
(174 pore volumes, PV) of operation, ﬂow through Column 2
stopped completely and this column was taken out of service.
During continuous-ﬂow operation, the pH of the active columns
remained slightly alkaline (between pH 7.3 and 8.0). In the control
column, pH values remained between 6.1 and 6.3 during the ﬁrst
30 days; then rapidly decreased to a value of 4.5 by 45 days, and
then slowly decreased to a pH close to that of the inﬂuent (pH
3.3) by the end of the experiment ( Fig. 3 A).
Accumulated alkalinity from the incubation period in the active
columns was rapidly ﬂushed out at the beginning of the continu-
ous operation. After 21 days of ﬂow (45 PV), the alkalinity de-
creased by more than 95% (from 4610 to 210 mg/L as CaCO 3).
Thereafter, alkalinity continued to decrease with time but at amuch slower rate, resulting in an average alkalinity of 120 mg/L
as CaCO
3from day 21 to day 102. At t= 102 days, alkalinity levels
slightly increased again, when the source of inﬂuent water waschanged to a more acidic source of AMD which induced a higher
dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals (Fig. 3 B). By the end of
the experiment ( t= 125 days, 268 PV) a residual alkalinity of
105 mg/L CaCO
3was still remaining in the active column.
Due to the detected interference of high hydronium ions with
the measurement of sulfate by IC, charge balance calculations with
PHREEQC were used to estimate the concentration of this anion inacidic samples (inﬂuent and control column). These corrected val-
ues showed that there was no sulfate removal occurring in the con-
trol column ( Fig. 3 C). In the active columns, about 80–90% of the
inﬂuent sulfate was removed at the beginning of continuous-ﬂowoperation, and decreased with time. The efﬂuent concentration of
sulfate in Column 1 equaled that of the inﬂuent by the end of the
test, while in Column 2, removal efﬁciency varied between 55%
and 85% until it was taken out of service.
No dissolved metals were detected in the active columns at the
beginning of continuous-ﬂow operation. Complete (100%) removal
lasted for almost 80 days (171 PV). Manganese breakthrough oc-
curred ﬁrst at t= 81 days (174 PV), followed by iron breakthrough
att= 109 days (234 PV), and aluminum breakthrough was never
detected ( Fig. 3 D–F). Initially, aluminum removal was detected inthe control column as well, but it only lasted for 40 days; after this
period, levels of this metal were higher than those measured in the
inﬂuent. No iron or manganese removal was observed in the con-
trol column. Instead, concentrations of iron in the efﬂuent of the
control column were higher than those measured in the inﬂuent
water. It is likely that the iron coating of the silica sand used as
packing material was leached by the acidic inﬂuent water.
Ammonium and VFA concentrations rapidly decreased after the
incubation period. Ammonium levels were already below 10 mg/L
after 25 days and dropped below 2 mg/L after 80 days (171 PV) of
continuous ﬂow (data not shown). Acetate was the main VFA re-
leased by the chitinous material during the test, at an average con-
centration of 88 mg/L (1.49 mM) for t= 4–45 days. Although
butyrate, propionate, and isovalerate had accumulated during theincubation period, their concentrations dropped below 0.1 mM
after the ﬁrst week of continuous operation. After 25 days
(54 PV), acetate was the only VFA detected, but at low concentra-
tions (<0.5 mM = 12 mg C/L, data not shown).
4. Discussion
4.1. Microcosm test
When converted to mequiv./L day, the generation rates for alka-
linity and calcium are extremely similar (0.82 and 0.86 mequiv./L
day, respectively). This indicates that the dissolution of the chi-
tin-associated carbonates present on crab-shell chitin particles is
the primary mechanism responsible for the initial chemical
changes in the three sets of microcosms. Furthermore, the dissolu-
tion rates of calcium carbonates (calcite and dolomite) are pH
dependent: dissolution is very fast at low pH and decreases about
an order of magnitude with every unit increase in pH ( Stumm and
Morgan, 1996 ). Under acidic conditions, dissolution is mass trans-
port limited, while under near-neutral pH, the rate is limited by
surface area. The present microcosm test was run under semi-stag-
nant conditions, with infrequent agitation (about once a day) and
consequently limited exposure of the surface of the chitinous
materials.Therefore, itislikelythat theobservedalkalinity generation
and acidity removal rates are lower than those that could be
obtained under well-mixed or continuous-ﬂow operation.
Previous AMD remediation studies have augmented different
substrate materials with an additional source of alkalinity, such
as limestone (Gibert et al., 2002 ). The presence of an alternative
alkalinity source, like chitin-associated carbonates, can producesimilar changes in an AMD treatment system. As the pH increases,
the water chemistry changes, affecting the equilibrium of the2345678

the solubility limits of their hydroxides or carbonates are reached.
The rapid recovery of pH and alkalinity obtained in the present
study shows that chitinous materials are a promising and efﬁcient
source of neutralizing power for AMD remediation, and eliminate
the need for an additional buffering agent. In these systems, there
were three signiﬁcant sources of alkalinity: calcium carbonate dis-
solution from the crab shell; volatile fatty acid production from
chitin and protein fermentation; and sulfate reduction by SRB.
The relative contribution of each of these to the alkalinity in the
microcosms can be estimated by assuming that during the ﬁrst
7–9 days of incubation, the increase in alkalinity (/C24 350 mg/L as
CaCO 3) corresponded mainly to the dissolution of chitin-associated
CaCO 3. This assumption is supported by an observed plateau of
calcium ion concentration after 9 days. At later times, substrate
fermentation became the predominant source of alkalinity from
the production of volatile fatty acids, corresponding to /C24200 mg/
L as CaCO 3. SRB contributed a total alkalinity of 160–180 mg/L as
CaCO 3from the reduction of 150–170 mg/L sulfate. Since the ﬁnal
alkalinity in the microcosm test was around 700 mg/L, it can beconcluded that half of the produced alkalinity was due to calcium
carbonate dissolution, and that VFA production and sulfate reduc-
tion each contributed to /C241/4 of the total.
In the microcosms, the acclimation of SRB took about 7 days.
The fact that the pH rapidly reached suitable values for SRB activity
before this suggests this lag period is due to other limiting factors.
SRB usually need to be in a consortium with fermentative bacteria
to degrade complex substrates and provide simple, short-chain
organics suitable for their growth. Therefore, it is likely that carbon
and nutrient limitations at the beginning of the tests (before chitin
fermentation occurred) played a major role on the duration of the
lag period. When comparing the differences in the initial popula-
tion of acetate-utilizing SRB added to each microcosm with the
change in sulfate concentrations over time, it is apparent that the
SRB activity was different for each site. Microcosms for the CR site
had an initial acetate-utilizing SRB inoculum about an order of
magnitude higher than the other two sites; however, the reduction
rates obtained were relatively comparable (/C0 13.6 ± 2.6 mg/L day).
In previous batch studies by others, sulfate removal rates rangedbetween 3 and 109 mg/L day, with an acclimation time of around
a week (Gibert et al., 2002 ).Waybrant et al. (1998) calculated a sul-
fate reduction rate on a substrate mass-basis ranging from /C00.14
to/C04:23 mg SO
2/C0
4=L day g. Although these rates appear to be rela-
tively similar to the ones we obtained in this study, the experi-ments were run under different conditions, and therefore cannot
be directly compared. It is also important to note that the sulfate
reduction rates reported in this study may be very different from
those that could be obtained in situ . In the ﬁeld, lower water tem-
peratures would be expected to decrease sulfate reduction rates
signiﬁcantly from those reported here. In addition, differences in
the solid-to-solution ratio, hydraulic retention time, as well as
changes in the substrate characteristics over time can all affect
the acclimation time and sulfate reduction rates (Johnson and
Hallberg, 2005; Neculita et al., 2007 ).
4.2. Column test
Acclimation of SRB and complete sulfate removal was achieved
more rapidly during the column test than in the microcosm test. Inthe packed columns, the chitin-to-sediment inoculum ratio was
the same as used for the microcosm test (1:2), but the liquid-to-so-
lid ratio was much lower (packed columns had an approximated
porosity of 0.38). Therefore, a higher concentration of electron do-
nors (VFAs) and nutrients rapidly accumulated in the columns,
boosting the microbial activity and leading to a shorter acclimation
time. There were also more microorganisms per mass of sulfate,0 50 100 150 200 250

od. In addition, the rapid increase in pH may have also contributed
to the rapid development of a healthy fermentative and sulfate-
reducing microbial community. As carbon and nitrogen supplies
decreased over the course of the experiment, sulfate removal efﬁ-
ciencies also decreased. However, the concentration of fermenta-
tion products increased and higher sulfate removal was observed
as the ﬂow rate in Column 2 decreased due to gas-clogging, indi-
cating that greater sulfate removal may be obtained in systems
with a longer (>11.2 h) retention time in the substrate.
Complete and efﬁcient removal of the three most abundant
metals in the AMD used (Al, Fe, and Mn) was observed during
the ﬁrst 80 days of operation of the active columns. To identify
the most likely mechanisms for the observed changes in metal con-
centrations and alkalinity, saturation indices (SI) were calculatedusing PHREEQC ( Fig. 4 ). Aluminum solubility is controlled by pH:
in both active and control columns, the pH rose very fast, reachingvalues at which Al solubility is very low, and allowing it to be re-
moved as a hydroxide precipitate from the beginning of the contin-
uous-ﬂow operation. As the very limited alkalinity source in the
control column was exhausted and the pH dropped, aluminum
breakthrough rapidly occurred. The higher efﬂuent concentrations
of aluminum after breakthrough indicate that acidic conditions
caused a leaching process of the initially retained aluminum
hydroxides. Contrastingly, since pH in the active column was
maintained near neutral, aluminum was always retained. Calcu-
lated saturation indexes (SI > 0, Fig. 4 ) indicate that the removal
of aluminum in the active columns was due to precipitation ofhydroxide phases (gibbsite, diaspore, and/or boehmite).
In spite of all efforts to maintain anoxic conditions, some iron
precipitation occurred in the inﬂuent reservoir. However, it is clear
that iron removal occurred in the active columns. Positive SI values
were obtained for both ferrous sulﬁdes (FeS, mackinawite, and pyr-
ite) and ferric (hydr)oxides (ferrihydrite, hematite, and goethite)
solid phases. Phases like FeS and ferrihydrite could be considered
as transient and precursors of the more stable minerals like pyrite
and goethite. Therefore, the later were chosen as representatives of
where the system would be driven to, after reaching equilibrium
(Fig. 4 ). More work must be done to determine the exact removal
mechanism for iron in AMD treatment systems supported bycrab-shell chitin.
Removal of manganese often represents a major challenge for
the remediation of AMD. This requires an increase in pH to pro-mote the (abiotic or biological) oxidation of Mn(II), followed bythe precipitation of insoluble Mn(IV) oxides (Hallberg and Johnson,
2005 ). Relatively high alkaline conditions are usually necessary to
ensure appropriate abiotic oxidation rates since manganese oxida-tion is very slow at pH < 8 (Stumm and Morgan, 1996 ). Under
reductive conditions, the removal of this metal appears to be dri-ven by the precipitation of carbonate phases (Benner et al.,
1999 ). Calculated SI values for this experiment (Fig. 4 ) indicate that
the column system was highly supersaturated with respect to cal-cium carbonate minerals and suggest rhodochrosite precipitation
as the main mechanism for manganese removal, consistent with
previous reports. The removal of manganese at relatively low pH
(/C247.5), compared to the high pH commonly required in conven-
tional Mn-removal processes, may represent a major advantageof crab-shell chitin over alternative substrates. After breakthrough,efﬂuent manganese concentrations remained around 1 mg/L for
more 30 PV and then rapidly increased, reaching inﬂuent concen-
trations within 64 pore volumes.
Another possible mechanism that could explain (at least par-
tially) the removal of metals in this experiment is adsorption. This
has been previously identiﬁed as an important method of metal
sequestration, especially under moderately acidic conditions. Sorp-
tion of dissolved metals onto organic substrates or onto Al–Fe-
(oxy)hydroxides has been observed in laboratory and ﬁeld studies
(Webb et al., 1998; Willow and Cohen, 2003; Gibert et al., 2005;
Neculita et al., 2007 ). Recent studies have evaluated the potential
of chitin and chitosan (its deacetylated derivative) as biosorptive
agents for the removal of industrially-relevant metals like zinc,
copper, chromium, cadmium, uranium, and lead (Yang and Zall,
1984; Boukhliﬁ and Bencheikh, 2000; Benguella and Benaissa,
2002; Maruca et al., 2003; Karthikeyan et al., 2005 ). However,
the competitive biosorption of metals commonly found in AMD(such as aluminum, iron, and manganese) has not yet been quanti-
ﬁed. Biosorption is a complex process that is not well understood
since it can involve several simultaneous mechanisms such as
complexation, chelation, ion exchange, and physical adsorption.
Therefore, although sorption is likely contributing toward the re-
moval of metals in this study, more research is needed to quantify
the metal removal capacity of crab-shell chitin in AMD systems,
which we will address in future work.
The sustained generation of alkalinity throughout the column
test demonstrat
es the potential of crab-shell chitin to serve as a
continuous, long-term source of neutralizing power for AMD reme-diation. Indeed, the columns were packed with 25 g of SC-20 chitin
(35% CaO, or 625 mg/g as CaCO
3) giving a carbonate-derived neu-
tralization capacity of more than 15,600 mg as CaCO 3. In addition,
the chitin and protein in the crab-shell can be converted into alka-
linity through microbial degradation, translating into an additional(theoretical) neutralization capacity of 23,500 mg as CaCO
3in each
column. Based on the measured acidity of the inﬂuent, the totalacidity input over the course of the column test was 2750 mg,
whereas the net alkalinity released (based on efﬂuent titrations)
corresponded to 10,300 mg as CaCO
3, with a contribution of
1930 mg from biological sulfate reduction (1853 mg of sulfatewere removed). This calculation shows that, by the end of the test,
the potential neutralization capacity of the SC-20 chitin was far
from being exhausted. However, it is important to point out that
not all of the calcium content of the SC-20 would necessarily be
converted into alkalinity, even under longer tests, due to the struc-
tural complexity of the material. In addition, it should be noted
that the theoretical neutralization capacity derived from the organ-
ic carbon was calculated assuming that every organic carbon atom
is converted into carbonate alkalinity; in reality, some incomplete
oxidation of the complex molecules derived from chitin can be ex-
pected. Also, a fraction of the available (organic) carbon will be
used for biomass synthesis, and the rate of biological alkalinity20222426

consortium.
The generation of high amounts of ammonium and organic car-
bon during the initial stages of incubation may denote a potential
drawback in the use of chitinous materials for passive treatment of
AMD. However, a rapid nutrient delivery at the beginning of the
process could be beneﬁcial to stimulate bacterial activity and de-
crease the duration of the lag period. Furthermore, those initial
high nutrient levels were rapidly ﬂushed out as continuous opera-
tion proceeded. One potential solution to high nutrient levels
would be to mix crab-shell chitin as an amendment with other so-
lid substrates (for example, to spent mushroom compost). This
alternative simultaneously takes advantage of the abundant nutri-
ent and alkalinity provision from chitin, while limiting the release
of nitrogen and carbon to the system, and maximizing costeffectiveness.
The use of crab-shell chitin as a fractional amendment, rather
than as the sole substrate, may be the most economically practi-
cal solution at the ﬁeld scale, since it is considerably more expen-
sive on a mass-basis than other currently available substrates
($0.20–60/lb for SC-20 crab-shell chitin vs. $50/ton for spent
mushroom compost and $20–30/ton for limestone). A fractional
amount of crab-shell chitin may be all that is required in some
cases to increase the activity of SRB, and thereby decrease the
size and cost of passive AMD treatment systems. There may be
some applications, however, where the use of crab-shell chitin
as the sole substrate is warranted both in terms of treatment
capacity and cost. As a neutralizing agent, crab-shell chitin ex-
ceeds that of traditional limestone. The micro-porous structure
of chitinous material provides a surface area that is several orders
of magnitude higher than that of limestone powder (14 vs.
<0.5 m
2/g). To achieve the same surface area as crab-shell chitin,
limestone addition would cost approximately 10 times more justin terms of materials alone. Furthermore, chitin-associated CaCO
3
appears to have a higher reactivity than that of limestone, leadingto higher dissolution rates and therefore faster changes in pH and
alkalinity. The higher chemical reactivity of its surface may ex-
plain why crab-shell chitin has not been observed to armor with
metal precipitates as limestone often does. Together, these prop-
erties make crab-shell chitin an attractive alternative for treating
acidic waste streams containing particularly recalcitrant com-
pounds (such as manganese), where the cost of continuous chem-
ical addition would be signiﬁcantly greater than that of passive
treatment. The US Environmental Protection Agency is currently
ﬁeld-testing crab-shell chitin at two Superfund sites in Colorado:
one for general AMD treatment, and the other speciﬁcally for
manganese removal. Continued monitoring of these ﬁeld sites
and further testing of crab-shell chitin as a fractional amendmentwill provide additional insight into the practical advantages of
using this multifunctional substrate.
5. Conclusions
The ﬁndings of this study demonstrate that chitinous materials
can be used as an alternative substrate to support the remediation
of acidic and metal-laden waters. The obtained results indicate
that, beyond its capacity to release electron donors for microbial
activity, this material can play a major role in the neutralization
of acidic streams and the removal of metal contaminants. In sum-
mary, in this study, the addition of raw crab-shell chitin:

to near-neutral values in less than 3 days.

precipitation as insoluble phases: aluminum hydroxides, man-
ganese carbonate (rhodochrosite), and iron hydroxides and/or
sulﬁdes.
Additional tests are currently underway to evaluate the use of
crab-shell chitin as a fractional amendment to other solid sub-strates to enhance overall treatment effectiveness while reducing
cost, as well as to evaluate the mechanisms of metal removal in-
duced by the addition of this alternative material (i.e. precipitationand adsorption).
