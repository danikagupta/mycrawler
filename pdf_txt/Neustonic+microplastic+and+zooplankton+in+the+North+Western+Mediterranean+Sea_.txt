Neustonic microplastic and zooplankton abundance was determined in the North Western Mediterra-
nean Sea during a summer cruise between July 9th and August 6th 2010, with a break between July
22th and 25th due to a strong wind event. Ninety percent of the 40 stations contained microplastic par-ticles (size 0.3–5 mm) of various compositions: e.g., ﬁlaments, polystyrene, thin plastic ﬁlms. An average
concentration of 0.116 particles/m
2was observed. The highest abundances (>0.36 particles/m2) were
observed in shelf stations.
The neustonic plastic particles concentrations were 5 times higher before than after the strong wind
event which increased the mixing and the vertical repartition of plastic particles in the upper layers of
the water column. The values rise in the same order of magnitude than in the North Paciﬁc Gyre. Theaverage ratio between microplastics and mesozooplankton weights was 0.5 for the whole survey andmight induce a potential confusion for zooplankton feeders.

1. Introduction
For more than 20 years, plastic debris has been accumulating on
the ocean surface. This period corresponds with the growth of plas-
tic-material production ( Thompson et al., 2004 ). Certain constitu-
ents of the debris could take more than 500 years to decompose
(Gorman, 1993; UNESCO, 1994 ). Recently, the issue of microplas-
tics (fragments less than 5 mm) has attracted increasing attention
worldwide. This ubiquitous, persistent debris requires centuries to
completely degrade ( Derraik, 2002; Hansen, 1990; Goldberg, 1997;
Arthur et al., 2009; Barnes et al., 2009; Zarlf et al., 2011 ).
Microplastics are accumulating at the sea surface, especially
within the neustonic habitat ( Ryan et al., 2009 ). This habitat har-
bors a diverse and speciﬁcally adapted zooplankton fauna. Several
oceanographic surveys reported high, geographically extensive
concentrations of microplastics over oceans and seas: the North-
east Paciﬁc Ocean ( Doyle et al., 2011 ), the central Northern Paciﬁc
Ocean ( Moore et al., 2001 ), the Sargassum Sea ( Law et al., 2010 )
and the waters off California ( Lattin et al., 2004 ) all showed high
abundances of microplastics at the sea surface.
Microplastics are obviously unsightly. Moreover, it is probable
that a wide range of marine organisms are affected by plasticwastes in the sea. Macrodebris ingestion and entanglement are
well documented in sea birds, mammals and turtles and more
recently in ﬁshes and invertebrates (e.g., Laist, 1987, 1997;
Gramentz, 1988; Weisskopf, 1988; Slip et al., 1990; Moser and
Lee, 1992; Shaw and Day, 1994; Goldberg, 1997; Robards et al.,
1995; Derraik, 2002; Thompson et al., 2004; Ryan et al., 2009;
Boerger et al., 2010; Murray and Cowie, 2011 ).
The potential confusion of microplastic particles with plankton
by ﬁlter feeders (the base of the food webs) in the neuston in the
North Paciﬁc Gyre has been discussed ( Moore et al., 2001 ). These
authors compared the relative abundance of microplastic particlesand zooplankton to speciﬁcally assess the potential impact of plas-
tic and animal prey on ﬁltering organisms. That study highlighted a
relatively high ratio of microplastic abundance to plankton abun-
dance (1:5), which may suggest a potential impact of microdebris
on various biota in this region. Previously, no offshore surveys of
plastic microfragments in the Mediterranean Sea have been con-
ducted. This paper investigates the ratio of microplastics to zoo-
plankton in neustonic waters of the Northwestern Mediterranean
Basin.
2. Materials and methods
Forty neustonic samples were collected between July 9th and
August 6th, 2010, in the Northwestern Mediterranean Basin, with
a break between July 22th and 25th due to a strong wind event.

The samples were collected at sea. A greater sampling effort was
made across the Liguro-Provençal Front ( Fig. 1 ). The stations have
been numbered 1–41 (station 8 was excluded due to a sampling
problem).
The samples were collected with a manta trawl net lined with
0.333 mm mesh ( Ryan et al., 2009 ). The size of the rectangular
net opening was 0.6 /C20.2 m2. The trawl sampled the top 10 cm
of the sea surface at an average speed of 2.5 knots for 20 min
for each sample. The trawl was towed from a boom installed
on the side of the boat to prevent the disturbance of the debris
by the bow wave.
Before transferring the samples from the collector to the jar,
the net was washed to collect all plankton and debris stuck
in the mesh. The samples were then reduced to a volume of
0.20 L and ﬁxed in 2.5% formalin.
The samples were placed in graduated cylinders to separate the
plastic particles from organic tissue by gravity. The organic tissue
sank and was deposited relatively thickly on the bottom of the
tubes, whereas the plastic fragments ﬂoated. The organic tissue
and the plastic were examined, sorted and measured under a bin-
ocular microscope. Plastic particles between 0.333 and 5 mm in
size were considered. The abundance of microplastic particles
was expressed as number per sea surface area sampled (parti-
cles/m2). The microplastic particles were weighed (accuracy:
0.1 mg) after drying the material for 24 h at 50 /C176C.
The zooplankton volume was measured after 24 h of sedimen-
tation in the graduated cylinders. The dry weight of zooplankton
has been estimated according to the ratio of 20.3 mg/mL obtained
experimentally ( Leborgne, 1975 ). The results are expressed in mg/
m2.
3. Results and discussion
Ninety percent of the 40 stations contained microplastic parti-
cles (size 0.333–5 mm) of various types: e.g., ﬁlaments, polysty-
rene, or thin plastic ﬁlms. Thirty percent of the samples
contained more than 0.1 particles/m2. A total of 4371 microplastic
particles, with a total dry weight of 7.9 g, were collected. The mean
weight of the microplastics was 1.81 mg per particle, with a mean
concentration of 2.02 mg/m2. An average concentration of0.116 particles/m2was observed over the total area investigated
(Table 1 ).
The values of plastic particle abundance ﬂuctuated widely be-
tween the stations: 0 particles/m2at stations 27–28–29–31 (Occi-
dental part); 0.010 particles/m2at station 33 (Marseille);
0.892 particles/m2at station 9 (Elba Island) ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). The
highest abundances (>0.36 particles/m2) were observed at the shelf
stations (Elba Island and Portoﬁno) associated with the wind direc-
tion and in the coastal portion of a transect of 10 stations oriented
perpendicular to the Western Corsican coast, where a convergence
area is associated with the Liguro-Provençal Front ( Goffart et al.,
2002 ). During the ﬁrst period of the survey (Zone A), 61% of the sta-
tions showed an average abundance of microplastics greater than
0.05 particles/m2. This percentage decreased to 19% for the stations
sampled in the second period of the survey (Zone B). This differ-
ence could be explained by the impact of the velocity and direction
of the wind ( Fig. 3 ). The microplastic particle concentrations mea-
sured during the ﬁrst part of the survey (mean: 0.306 mg/m2; sta-
tions 1–24, Eastern area) before the strong wind event were 5
times higher than those measured during the second part of the
survey (mean: 0.060 mg/m2; stations 25–41, Western area). This
signiﬁcant difference may be explained by the drastic changes in
wind conditions (wind force 5–6 B) during the second part of the
survey. The resulting wind stress increased the mixing and the ver-
tical redistribution of the plastic particles in the upper layers of the
water column.
The mean abundance of microplastics estimated here is of the
same order of magnitude as that found for the North Paciﬁc Gyre
(0.334 particles/m2,Moore et al., 2001 ). However, the present

monitoring in the Caribbean Sea (0.001 particles/m2) and in the
Gulf of Maine (0.002 particles/m2) as well as in the North Atlantic
Gyre (0.020 particles/m2), where the Subtropical Convergence is
responsible for the accumulation of ﬂoating particles ( Law et al.,
2010 )(Table 2 ). It is probable that the high microdebris abun-
dances obtained in this assessment are due to the speciﬁc conﬁgu-
ration of the semi-enclosed Mediterranean system. The
Mediterranean is subject to permanent waste inputs, such as that
occurring on the continental shelf of the Golf du Lion. This area
is affected by the outﬂow from the Rhone River and by NW winds
(the Mistral and Tramontane winds) that ﬂush wastes towards off-shore waters ( Galgani et al., 2000 ).
This ﬁrst set of results suggests that the mean weight of parti-
cles was smaller in this study (1.81 mg) than in the North Paciﬁc
Gyre (14.97 mg). In the North Paciﬁc Gyre, microplastics derived
from ﬁshing or nautical activities were primarily encountered
(Moore et al., 2002 ). In contrast, smaller material ﬂushed at sea
from continental output was recorded in Northwestern Mediterra-
nean coastal waters, where most of the particles (69%) were smal-
ler than 2 mm. This difference could be due to more intense
mechanical action, a longer residence time (older debris) or more
substantial fouling involving larger debris.
The zooplankton weight ﬂuctuated between 0.041 mg/m
2and
1.81 mg/m2, and the average zooplankton weight was similar in
the western (0.480 mg/m2) and the eastern (0.406 mg/m2) parts
of the area investigated ( Table 1 ). The zooplankton, unlike themicroplastics, is relatively unaffected by wind stress and mixing
and can swim to maintain its distribution in the neustonic layers.
The average ratio between the microplastic and mesozooplankton
weights was 0.5 for the whole survey and is relatively low com-
pared to other regions ( Moore et al., 2001 ).
Few studies have addressed the impact of microplastics on ﬁl-
ter-feeding organisms or other planktivorous animals. Microplas-
tics in great abundance within the photic zone could both
compete with and threaten the plankton. The neustonic habitat
is a feeding area for various organisms that capture plankton ac-
tively or through water ﬁltering. Laboratory experiments demon-
strate that amphipods, barnacles and worms could ingestmicroplastics. In these experiments, plastic fragments were found
in the stomachs of the experimental animals ( Thompson et al.,
2004 ). Salps can also be affected ( Moore et al., 2001 ) because they
cannot differentiate plastic fragments from plankton. Microplastics
were found in the guts of certain planktivorous ﬁshes (Myctophi-
dae, Stomiidae and Scomberesocidae) in the North Paciﬁc Gyre,
with an average of 2.1 pieces per ﬁsh ( Boerger et al., 2010 ). In
the Mediterranean during the present survey, plastic microdebris
were found in the stomachs of myctophids ( Myctophum puncta-
tum) (Laboratoire Biodoxis/Foundation CIMA, unpublished data).
In conclusion, many aspects of the distribution and impact on
the environment of microplastics require further study. The phys-
iological effects related to plastic ingestion are poorly understood,
as are the implications of plastic ingestion for food chains. Micro-
plastics can be a signiﬁcant carrier of lipophilic chemicals (POPs)

and polyphenols that can potentially affect organisms ( Teuten
et al., 2007 ). Additional studies are required to assess the transfer
mechanisms of those compounds from plastic to zooplanktonic
organisms at the base of the food chain. Moreover, plastic frag-
ments can act as substrates to allow the transport of alien species
(Barnes, 2002; Aliani and Molcard, 2003; Gregory, 2009 ).
The present study provides an initial insight into microplastic
pollution in the Mediterranean Sea by reporting the concentration
levels and spatial distribution of microplastics in the area
surveyed.
