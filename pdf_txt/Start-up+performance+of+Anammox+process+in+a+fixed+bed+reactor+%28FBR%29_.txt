Nitrogen removal from wastewater is an energy and resource intense operation. In response, 
anaerobic ammonium oxidising (anammox) bacteria are being increasingly applied as a cost 
effective and sustainable wastewater treatment. Despite their utilisation wo rldwide, very 
little is understood about kinetic parameters and factors impacting their niche differentiation. The lack of enriched planktonic cultures is limiting further investigations into anammox bacteria and the optimisation of wastewater treatment. I n this study, a Continuously Stirred 
Tank Reactor (CSTR) inoculated with Candidatus Brocadia fulgida to obtain an enriched 
planktonic culture. Ca. Brocadia fulgida was selected due to Ca. Brocadias widespread 
application in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWT Ps), and the lack of planktonic cultures of 
this anammox species. The cultivation of anammox bacteria is a time -consuming operation, 
due to the slow growth rate. This operation was conducted for 84 days, and variety of 
analytical and microbial techniques w ere used to monitor bioreactor performance and 
anammox bacteria enrichment. An analysis of consumption and production patterns was 
performed to investigate anammox metabolism. Changes in the microbial community were also assessed, which indicated a culture  enriched in anammox bacteria. The establishment of 
a planktonic culture enriched in Ca. Brocadia fulgida in a CSTR was not achieved, and further 
research is needed in order to successfully apply this innovative approach to anammox bacteria cultivation.

  1 Introduction  
1.1 Nitrogen in Environment and Engineering systems  
1.1.1 Nitrogen Cycle in Nature  
Nitrogen (N) comprises 78  % of the Earth ’s atmosphere and is the fourth most abundant 
element in biomass  (Stein and Klo tz, 2016) . Nitrogen gas (N 2) is a very stable compound due 
to its triple bond, requiring large amounts of energy to break (Bernhard, 2010) . The nitrogen 
cycle is the interchange between inert nitrogen abundant in the atmosphere, and reactive 
nitrogen (N r), which are nitrogen compounds that support or are products of cellular 
metabolism and growth (Stein and Klo tz, 2016) . The nitrogen  cycle  is almost entirely a 
microbe mediated process  and a key process for life on Earth.  Nitrogen flows  through 
terrestrial and marine ecosystems,  and is transformed into variety of compounds, before 
returning to the atmosphere. In a natural cycle free from human influence, the only sources 
of N r would be the result of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and the production of nitrous 
oxides (NO x) by lightning . These are primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitr ous oxide (N 2O) (Fowler 
et al., 2013)  . 
 
 
Figure 1: Major transformations in the nitrogen cycle (Bernhard, 2010)

 Understanding of the nitrogen cycle has developed. It was traditionally divided into three 
processes ; nitrogen  fixation, nitrification and denitrification, with microbes labelled with their 
respective role. Nowadays, there are five accepted nitrogen- transformation flows:  
ammonification , nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification and  anammox (Stein and Klotz, 
2016) . Figure 1 displays  these process es within the nitrogen cycle, including whether the 
process  occurs under  anoxic  or oxic conditions .  
Ammonification  is the mineralisation of organic nitrogen  compounds  (i.e. compounds with 
ammino  groups containing NH 2) such as  those found in the tissues of plants and animals in to 
ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH 4+) (Strock, 2008) . The bacterial decomposition of tissue 
release s inorganic nitrogen into the ecosystem, where it is once more available for uptake by 
other organisms  (Bernhard, 2010) . This process occurs under  oxic conditions.  
Nitrogen fixation comprises  the breakage of the nitrogen triple bond, producing biologically 
usable ammonium for uptake by plants and animals (Cabello et al., 2009, Stein and Klotz, 
2016) . Nitrogen is the limiting nutrient in primary production, despite the abundance of  
nitrogen gas  in the atmosphere (Bernhard, 2010, Galloway, 2005) . The majority of this 
process , when performed in nature  and not synthetically, is  executed  by a select group of 
prokaryotes. A limited  amount of nitrogen is also fixed abiotically by lightning  (Bernhard, 
2010) . Nitrogen fixation occurs under anoxic conditions and is an extremely oxygen sensitive 
process  (Stein and Klotz, 2016) . 
Nitrification is t he aerobic conversion of ammonia to nitrite then to  nitrate . Complete 
nitrification is a two -step process . The initial stage involves the oxidation of ammonia to 
nitrite by ammonia oxidis ing bacteria (AOB) . This n itrite is then further oxidised to nitrate by 
nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) . Nitrifying  bacteria are autotrophs , requiring no organic 
carbon for their  metabolism.  This is in comparison to heterotrophs, which utilise organic 
compounds as an energy source.  AOB and NOB are utilised in nitrogen removal in Wastewate r 
Treatment Plants ( WWTP ), transforming  nitrogenous compounds  and preventing water 
pollution (Bernhard, 2010) .  
Denitrification is the reduction of nitrate  and to nitrogen gas, with intermediates such as 
nitrite, nitric oxide  and nitrous oxide . The latter two are potent greenhouse gases.

 Denitrification is an anaerobic  process  performed by  chemoorganotrophs, which must have 
an organic carbon source. Denitrification is an important process in WWTP s, removing 
unwanted nitrates from water effluent (Bernhard, 2010) . 
Anammox, or anaerobic ammonium oxidation , is the oxidation  of ammonium coupled to the 
reduction of nitrite which produce s dinitrogen gas  (Stein and Klo tz, 2016) . Anammox bacteria 
are responsible for the removal of fixed nitrogen from the environment in anoxic  
environments  (Kartal et al., 2007) . This process will be further discussed in greater detail in 
section  1.2. 
 
1.1.2 Nitrogen Cycle Imbalance  and Associated  Problems  
Under natural condition s, the nitrogen cycle is well balanced  and nitrogenous compounds are 
recycled through the cycle with no accumulation.  However , nitrogen is a limiting factor for 
plant growth, and this has resulted in human interference in the nitrogen cycle. Since the 19th 
century, legume cultivation and the application of animal manure  has provided a nitrogen 
rich substrate for crop production, with minimal negative consequences (Galloway, 2005) . 
The development of nitrogen- based  fertilisers, industrially produced by the Haber -Bosch 
process , has facilitated an enormous increase in food production and a global population 
increase (Gruber and Galloway, 2008) . The industrial production of fertilisers is therefore  
essential  to support humanity , with a lmost half the wo rld population dependent on fertiliser 
for their food supply (Fowler et al., 2013, Galloway, 2005) .  
In 2010, t he extent of nitrogen fixation by the Haber -Bosch process (120 Tg -N yr−1) process is 
almost double that  of the natural cycle (63 Tg -N yr−1) (Fowler et al., 2013) . One Tg is equal to 
106 tonnes.  However, less than 20  % of industrial fertiliser is taken up by crops , making it a 
very inefficient process. The rest is lost to the environment; either to the atmosphere, 
hydrosphere or stored in soil s (Galloway, 2005) . All of the nitrogen resulting from agricultural 
activities , in addition to nitrogenous gases generated through the burning of fossil fuels , are 
dispersed into  the environment (Gruber and Galloway, 2008) . The excess nitrogen cascades 
through the E arth’s  ecosystems, disrupting the natural  cycle and processes, adversely 
impacting human health, ecosystem services, biodiversity and contributing to climate change .    
 
4 
 (Erisman et al., 2 013) . Figure 2  shows  the significant anthropogenic influences on the nitrogen 
cycle. A selection of the associated environmental issues are  discussed below:  
 
 
Figure 2: Overview of anthro pogenic impacts on the nitrogen cycle  (Erisman et al., 2011) 
 
Fertiliser run off or sewerage discharge can enrich the nitrogen content of fresh and coastal 
water ecosystems. Biomass and biodiversity may temporarily increase with the increased nutrient load, but eventually phytoplankton are favoured.  These algal or cyanobacterial 
blooms  are referred to as eutrophication . They choke waterways and can le ad to the release 
of toxic compounds. Decomposition of phytoplankton biomass decreases oxygen content in 
the water, leading to hypoxia, or ‘dead zones ’. This results in reduced species diversity, as 
only tolerant species can survive. Disruption to  lower tr ophic level s can affect species up the 
food chain, including mammals and birds  (Erisman et al., 2013) . 
Imbalances  in the nitrogen c ycle can also negatively affect human health. NO
x can result in 
increased tropospheric ozone (O 3) formation, as well as toxic smog, particulate matter (PM) 
and aerosols (Erisman et al., 2013) . These have been linked to respiratory illnesses, cancer 
and cardiac disease in humans (Galloway, 2005) . The pollution of groundwater from nitrate 
   
 
5 
 is recognised as a human risk factor, with chr onic effects being experienced at just 3  mg NO 3- 
L-1. Agricultural activities are responsible for groundwater and surface water pollution, 
threatening human drinking water (Erisman et al., 2013) . 
Industrial nitrogen fixation has allowed for increased food production yet has come with 
undesired consequences  on human and environmental health, including biodiversity loss and 
climate impacts (Erisman et al., 2013, Fowler et al., 2013) . With the global population 
predicted to continue its current growth rate, so t oo will demand for food and energy. It is 
therefore probable that anthropogenic nitrogen fluxes , and associated negative 
consequences , are destined to increase (Gruber and Galloway, 2008) .  
 
1.1.3 Need for Wastewater Treatment  
Urbanisation and population growth worldwide has resulted in increased wastewater 
generation. With increasing awareness of sustainability, WWTPs  are evolving from primarily 
focused on water recovery, to resource recovery, while minimising chemical and energy inputs  (Guven et al., 2019) . As discussed in section  1.1.2, n itrogen is a key concern for water 
quality. To prevent ecological and human health impacts, wastewater must be treated before 
release into the environment. In many countries this is enforced by legislation (Farazaki and 
Gikas, 2019) . A variety of methods exist; chemical, physicochemical and biological, for the 
removal of wastewater charged with nitrogen (Ni et al., 2016) .
  
 
1.1.4 Nitrogen Removal in Conventional Wastewater Treatment Plants  
WWTPs are designed to achieve the removal of pollutants before release into the environment, mainly organic matter (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (Ni et al. , 2016) . 
Conventional activated sludge (CAS) is the most applied treatment of municipal wastewater 
in developed countries  (Guven et al., 2019) . Activated sludge is  a mixture of the  microbial 
community , responsible for the biodegradation  of sewerage substrates , combined with inert 
solids (van Loosdrecht and Brdjanovic, 2014) . This process traditionally referred  exclusively to 
the biological treatment  or oxidation of  carbonaceous organic matter, although significant    
 
6 
 improvements have been developed to include the removal of nitrogenous compounds and 
phosphorous . However, these  CAS systems  are very  energy intensive, and high carbon 
removal efficiencies  limit the effectiveness of later de nitrification steps (Guven et al., 2019) . 
In CAS operations , organic matter is initially converted into carbon dioxide ( CO 2) and the 
assimilation of new biomass in the activated sludge. Ammonia is then nitrified to nitrite then nitrate, before reduction to nitrogen gas  (Guven et al., 2019) . 
Not all WWTP s are equipped or  specialised for nitrogen or phosphorous removal, but those 
that do are called biological nutrient removal (BNR) plants (Guven et al., 2019) . BNR is the 
most implemented approach to nitrogen removal of wastewater  (Ni et al., 2016) . With this 
method, microbial communities exist in activated sludge under different conditions  to 
achieve the removal of both organics and nutrients. Both the nitrification and denitrification 
steps must be  completed for complete nitrogen removal (Farazaki and Gikas, 2019, Ni et al., 
2016) .  
While a erobic  conditions are required for  the nitrification  process , which is performed by 
autotrophs requiring only inorganic carbon for growth, the denitrification  process requires a 
significant organic carbon load and anoxic conditions  (Farazaki and Gikas, 2019) . To achieve 
these opposing  environments , biological reactors with different conditions are serially linked. 
A mix of wastewater and activated sludge flows through the reactors, before a clarification step  where the sludge settles and is retained, while the treated water is discharged.  The entire 
process  can be seen outlined in Figure 3.   
The first tank is where denitrification occu rs under anoxic  conditions.  Nitrates and organic 
carbon from raw wastewater are consumed. The effluent then flows to subsequent aeration 
tank where nitrification and thus the production of nitrate  occurs. Recirculation between the 
anoxic and aerated  tanks allows for nitrates to be consumed (Farazaki and Gikas, 2019) . This 
process can transform 75  % of nitrogen from  the influent into nitrogen  gas, and an additional 
20 % is incorporated into sludge, requiring further treatment. Approximately 5  % of the 
nitrogen remains in the effluent (Ni et al., 2016) . The process is effective with regards to  
nitrogen removal;  howe ver, the aeration requi rement of nitrification makes it a very energy 
intensive process  (Guven et al., 2019, Ni et al., 2016) .    
 
7 
  
Figure 3: BNR in a WWTP (Raper et al., 2019)  
 
1.1.5 Problems with Conventional Treatment  
The most significant drawback of BNR is the high requirement for aeration, and  its associated 
energy costs. Aeration has  the highest energy demand of WWTP s, comprising up to 60  % of 
total  energy consumption. Sludge treatment accounts for a  further 35 % and pumping a n 
additional 15 % (Guven et al., 2019) . BNR process have addition al oxygen demand to CAS, in 
order to supply oxygen for the nitrification stage, and the additional pumping required for 
recirculation and sludge treatment (Guven et al., 2019) . 
Heterotrophic denitrification requires an organic carbon electron donor. The organic carbon demand for denitrification is significant, while the organic matter present in most wastewater 
streams is comparatively low. This necessitates the addition of large quantities of organic 
matter. Methanol is  the most widely utilised carbon source, as it is cheapest in terms of cost 
per mass of nitr ogen  remov ed, but a variety of other carbon substrates can be used (Ni et al., 
2016) . Denitrification is coupled both to energy production and bacterial growth. This results 
in a high production of biomass resulting from heterotrophic denitrification, the treatment 
and removal of which adds considerable cost to the operation of the WWTP (Ni et al., 2016) .  
Of increasing concern in escaping intermediates of the denitrification process, particularly 
nitrous oxide , a greenhouse ga s 300 times more po tent than carbon dioxide . There are reports 
that up to  1.8 % of  the nitrogen loading rate ( NLR) is lost as nitrous oxide , contributing to  
climate  damage  (Ni et al., 2016) . Different denitrification enzymes have varying  
   
 
8 
 environmental sensitivities  which can lead  to the accumulation of intermediates. This results  
in incomplete denitrification and the presence  of undesirable nitrogen compounds in the 
emissions and effluent (Ni et al., 2016) . Modern technologies  and processes can be 
introduced for more efficient and less energy intensive nitrogen removal. These  innovations , 
when coupled with anaerobic sludge digestion for biogas production, can result  in an energy 
neutral WWTP (Guven et al., 2019, Wen et al., 2020) . One promising alternative to 
conventional treatments is the anammox process.  
 
1.2 Anammox Process  
1.2.1 Anammox Bacteria  
The existence of the anam mox metabolism was proposed in the 1970’s , but it was not until 
the 19 90s that the presence  of anammox bacteria was confirmed (Wu et al., 2020) . Anammox 
bacteria belong to the Planctomycetes phylum. The y are chemolithoautotrophic , obtaining 
their energy from chemical reactions without the use of organic compounds ,  and are thought  
to be responsible for 50  % of nitrogen gas  that is released into the atmosphere (Kartal et al., 
2013) . Consequently , anamm ox bacteria are widely considered to play a key role in the global 
nitrogen cycle (Kartal et al., 2013, Oshiki et al., 2013, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Since their 
initial discovery they have been identified in a variety of ecosystems with low oxygen 
availability. Six genera have been described  so far , including Candidatus Brocadia, Ca. 
Kuenenia, Ca. Scalindua, Ca.  Anammoxoglobus, Ca. Jettenia  and Ca. Anammoximicrobium . All 
are found in freshwater systems, with the exception of Ca. Scalind ua which is exclusively 
found in saline environments  (Wu et al., 2020) . 
 
1.2.2 Anammox Metabolism  
Anammox bacteria are capable of the oxidation of ammonium in anoxic environments, 
utilisin g nitrite as an electron acceptor. Nitrate and dinitrogen gas are produced (Zhang and 
Okabe, 2020) . The proposed stoichiometry  can be seen in Equation 1 below  (Strous et al., 
1998) . Anammox bacteria are chemolithoautotrophic , utilising only inorganic compounds  to 
derive their  energy. Carbonate serves as the sole carbon source for biomass synthesis (Jetten

 et al., 2009) . The reaction occurs in a highly specialised, membrane bound organelle called 
the anammox osome. The proposed equation for the anam mox process  is as follows:  
 
 
Equation 1: Anammox nitro gen s toichiometry  (Strous et al., 1998) . 
 
 
Anamm ox bacteria  are found in na tural and engineered environments , where substrates are 
scarce and nitrite is typically limiting (Kartal et al., 2007, Zhang and Ok abe, 2020) . They are 
characterised by high substrate affinity , utilising substrates at very low concentrations ( < 5 
μM)  (Jetten et al., 2009) . 
Anammox bacteria grow slowly , with  a doubling time ( td) reported from one to several weeks 
and variations between the species studied and reactor type (Wen et al., 2020, Wu et al., 
2020) . This contributes to the difficulty in  enriching and isolating anammox  (Jetten et al., 
2009) . No anammox species has been successful isolated, though several have been highly 
enriched (Wu et al., 2020) . Enrichment cultivations of free living anammox cells require large 
amounts substantial amounts of time , in the  order of 100 to 200 days (Zhang and Okabe, 
2020) . This concept has been recently challenge d by the cultivation of Ca. Kuenenia 
stuttgartiensis which was  successfully enriched to 87  %, with a doubling time of 3 days after 
just 30 days of reactor operation (Ding et al., 2018) .  
In addition to ammonium, organic acids have been shown to serve as the electron donor 
(Kartal et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2020) . While the  presence of organic carbon can inhibit growth, 
anammox  bacteria  have been shown  to co -metabolise fatty acids (Wu et al., 2020) . Anammox 
bacteria can use fatty acids  as electron donors to reduce nitrite and nitrate in order to 
outcompete heterotrophic denitrifiers in the presence of ammonium  (Jetten et al., 2009, 
Kartal et al., 2007) . Ca. Brocadia fulgida in particular has been  identified as having a superior 
ability to oxidise acetate compared to other species, leading to the enrichment of Ca.

 1.2.3 Microbial Interactions  
The lack of pure cultures of anammox bacteria means th at other microbes are always present 
in anammox -based  systems. Interactions between other bacteria  can be both cooperative 
and competitive (Zha ng and Okabe, 2020) . WWTP s streams  typically have a high 
concentration of ammonium with nitrite limiting. However, anammox bacteria require both 
nitrite and ammonium. Thus , partial nitration , which involves the  partial oxidation  of 
ammonium to nitrite  by AOB, is required before subsequent anammox treatment. AOB  
activity  simultaneously ensures  an anoxic environment, through the consumption of oxygen ,  
in addition to providing  substrate for the anam mox bacteria  (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . On the 
other hand, a nammox  bacteria  must compete against AOB for ammonium (Wu et al., 2020) . 
While AOB are present in anammox reactors, they grow extremely slowly (Wu et al., 2020) . 
Anammox bacteria m ust also compete  against  NOB and denitrifiers for nitrite . Denitrifiers can 
effectively compete with anammox  bacteria for nitrite in the presence of suitable  organic  
electron donors  (Wu et al., 2020) . Anammox bacteria with high oxygen tolerance  and high 
substrate affinity are  most suited to compete with other nitrogen cycle microbes (Zhang and 
Okabe, 202 0). While microbes also compete with anammox  bacteria, c ooperation within 
microbial communities have significant potential for enhancing the nitrogen removal in 
WWTP s (Wu et al., 2020) . 
In addition to competition between different nitrogen cycle bacteria , there also exists 
competition between different anammox species. In this interspecific competition, different anammox species compete for resource s or living space. This results in the decline or 
exclusion of the less adapted species, resulting in niche differentiation (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Key factors in shaping community include the environmental conditions, growth 
kinetics and metabolic flexibility  (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . There is a lack o f understanding 
on the mechanisms affecting the niche differentiation of anammox bacteria  (Zhang and 
Okabe, 2020) .  
Anammox  bacteria  have a predisposition to form biofilms or aggregations (Zhang and Okabe, 
2020) . With many interactions occurring at the oxic/ano xic boundary, the formation of 
granules is beneficial for all nitrogen cycle bacteria . In single -stage wastewater treatment 
systems, AOB can dominate the outer region, proving nitrite for NOB. Nearer the centre of    
 
11 
 the granule, the anoxic conditions are well suited to denitrifiers  and anam mox bacteria , which 
then transform nitrogeno us substrates to nitrogen gas (Figure 4) . The bacteria  on the outer 
layer are more active, as the diffusion of substrate is limited by the granule (Ali et al., 2016) . 
The interactions between anammox specie s, and between other nitrogen cycle 
microorganisms  are both fragile and complicated, and require further investigation to 
understand niche differentiation mechanisms  (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . 
 
 
Figure 4: Simplified  cooperation between diverse nitrogen cycle microbes in a single -system granule  (Driessen and 
Hendrickx, 2021)  
 
1.2.4 Niche Differentiation  of Anammox Bacteria  
The factors affecting  how  different anammox species find their own ecological space, i.e.,  
anammox niche differentiation, remain to be answered  (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Substrate 
availab ility, and the relevant substrate affinity are  believed to be key parameter s. Ca. 
Brocadia sinica was able to proliferate at higher NLR, whereas  Ca. J ettenia  caeni was only able 
to grow at low nitrite  concentrations  (Zhang et al., 2017a) . The saturation constant ( Ks) is 
considered a key parameter for understanding  microbial growth and niche differentiation.  
However, the K s for different anammox species have been reported in a wide range, with 
ammon ium (KNH4+: 3.0– 640 μM) and nitrite (K NO2-: 0.2– 370 μM) (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . 
Many of these val ues have been obtained from  granules or sludge . Therefore , substrate  
transport limitations and mixed cultures contributed to the lack of a clearly defined K s value  
and require reassessment  (Zhang et al., 2 017b, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) .  
   
 
12 
 The presence of carbon compounds can also influence the ability of a species to dominate in 
a culture. In one study, where a nammox  bacteria was enriched from  WWTP sludge  under 
identical operation conditions  except for  the addition of a carbon source , the addition of 
acetate lead to the dominance of Ca . Brocadia fulgida,  while Ca. Anammoxoglobus  
propionicus proliferated with the availability of propionate (Jetten et al., 2009) . Trace 
elements, including those found in the groundwater , can also result in a population shift. A 
mature culture enriched in Ca. B rocadia sinica from Sapporo, Japa, shifted to Ca. Kuenenia  
stuttgartiensis when cultivated in Niigata, Japan. The only difference was the use of the local 
groundwater. Interestingly, when the Ca.  Kuenenia dominant culture was returned to 
Sapporo, the reactor  reverted to a culture enriched with Ca. Bro cadia sinica (Zhang and 
Okabe, 2020) . This indicates that minor changes  in the environment can  provide species with 
a competitive advantage (Jetten et al., 2009) . The importance of understanding the factors  
influencing niche differentiation allows for the selection of the most suitable anammox  
species  for wastewater applic ations and preventing unwanted population shifts (Zhang and 
Okabe, 2020) . So far, c lear guidelines to cultivate one anammox species o ver another has not 
been established and further rese arch is required in this area.  
 
1.2.5 Planktonic Cells and Aggregated Sludge  
Anammox bacteria tend to form aggregations including other microbes. This results in oxygen 
concentration gradients within the granules  which allows competing species to coexist in their 
preferred environment within the aggregation  (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . It has been found 
that, due to substrate diffusion limitations, populat ions nearer the surface of the granule are 
more active than thos e in the centre  (Oshiki et al., 2020) . The ability of anammox  bacteria to 
aggregate varies among species. Increased hydrophobic cell surfaces, such as those detected on Ca. B rocadia sinica, relates to an increased tendency to aggregate (Zhang and Okabe, 
2020) .  
These granules provide a protective environment against environmental inhibitors , while  the 
formation of biofilms prevents washout.  While aggregate and biofilm formation is a useful 
survival tactic, it makes understanding the  factors and mechanisms of niche differentiation 
and kinetic studies difficult to investigate  (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . In addition, the    
 
13 
 biochemistry and kinetic parameters remain uncertain, mainly due to the lack of planktonic 
free-living  cultures . Planktonic cells are essential for further investigation of the anammox 
process. An enriched, planktonic culture is suitable for obtaining puri fied proteins, required 
for further research into the biochemistry of anammox pathways. They are also crucial to deepen our understanding of anammox physiological characteristics (Oshiki et al., 2013) . 
 
1.2.6 Parameters and Operational Conditions  
Parameters such as the pH, temperature , dissolved  oxygen ( DO) concentration and substr ate 
concentrations  must be monitored to provide suitable conditions for anammox activity and 
prevent inhibition. Anammox bacteria have been identified in many natural and engineered 
anoxic and suboxic environments , which is  the interface between anoxic and oxic zones  
characterised  by low oxygen concentrations  (Kartal et al., 2007) . These vary from soil and 
ocean environments to WWTPs (Wu et al., 2020, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Anammox  bacteria  
are obligate anaerobes whose metabolism are reversibly inhibited at increased oxygen  levels 
(Jetten et al., 2009) . Low oxygen conditions, with DO concentrations below 0.1 mg L-1 are 
favourable growth conditions for Ca. Brocadia sinica (Oshiki et al., 2013) . DO concentration 
must  therefore  be controlled during the process as excessive oxygen will enable the growth 
nitrifiers and inhibit anammox activity . This competition can lead to an accumulation of 
nitrogen within the system  (Wen et al., 2020) .  
Oxygen tolerance is dependent on the aggregation state of the biomass, whether it be aggregated or planktonic cells. The presence of oxygen appears to only inhibit the anammox 
process, and can be reversed (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Planktonic anammox cells are more 
sensitive to oxygen, especially at low cell density (Oshiki et al., 2020) .  
During the anammox process, hydrogen ions are consumed resulting in an increasing pH 
within the reactor (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Many  anammox species  to date  have been 
enriched at pH ranging between 6.8 and 8.5 (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . The pH could play an 
significant role  in regu lating AOB, which in turn influences the system dynamics and impacts 
anammox  growth (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) .     
 
14 
 Anammox  bacteria  have a wide temperature tolerance  which varies dependent on the 
species. In order to adapt to temperature changes, anammox  species  have been observed to 
alter their lipid  composition  (Wu et al., 2020) . Maximum anammox activity is reported 
between 35  °C and 40  °C, however , above 45 °C biomass lysis occurs  and activity is irreversibly 
lost. Lower temperatures ( 15 °C) result in lower activity  and the accumulation of nitrite (Wu 
et al., 2020) .  
Freshwater anammox species have been enriched at temperatures betwee n 27 °C and 37  °C, 
and marine species between 15  °C and 25  °C. Maximum activity was observed at 37  °C for 
freshwater species, including Ca. Brocadia sinica (Zhang et al., 2017a, Zhang and Okabe, 
2020) . Marine species favour cooler environments to those found in freshwater systems  (Wu 
et al., 2020) . 
Anammox  bacteria  are autotrophic, and the presence organic carbon matter can inhibit their 
growth. This has been shown at concentrations (measured in chemical oxygen  demand (COD) ) 
of over 237 mg COD L−1  (Wu et al., 2020, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Methanol in particular has 
been identified as a strong inhibi tor of most anammox bacteria (Narita et al., 2017) . Nitrite 
too, although also a substrate, can inhibit anammox activity at high concentrations and is 
important to control during the operation (Zhang et al., 2017b) . Partial in hibition occurs when 
concentrations exceeded 3.6 mM nitrite  and total inhibition was observed at levels over 7.2  
mM nitrite  (Wu et al., 2020, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Other studies report 50 % inhibition of 
a culture containing both Ca . Brocadia and Ca. Jette nia at 11.6 mM nitrite , allowing for a much 
wider range of nitrite tolerances (Narita et al., 2017) . The importance of maintaining the 
nitrite below toxic levels, especially during the initial phase of operation has been strongly 
emphasised (Wu et al., 2020) . Nitrite sensitivity also varies between species  and aggregation 
states , with Ca. Brocadia  sinica tolerating over  16 mM nitrite  concentrations . In comparison , 
Ca. Jettenia  caeni, was only determined to  tolerate up to 11  mM (Zhang et al., 2017a) . This 
might account for the ability of Ca . Brocadia to recover better and have a highe r abundance 
than Ca. Jettenia after a high dose of substrate (Wu et al., 2020) . High concentrations of 
ammonium and nitrate (between 25 an d 50 mM) have been linked to anammox activity 
inhibition (Wu et al., 2020) . Other inhibitors observed include sulfide (>5  mM), phosphate 
(>50  mM)  (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) ,  and high concentrations of calcium and magnesium (Wu 
et al., 2020) .    
 
15 
 1.2.7 The A nammox  Process  in Wa stewater Treatment  
For the treatment of wastewater containing high concentrations of ammonia, the anammox 
process  is an innovative discovery (Wen et al., 2020) . Over 200 anammox facilities are in 
operation worldwide, with wastewater from monosodium glutamate, pharmaceutical and 
agricultural industries, as well as landfill leachate have successfully  been  treated with the 
anammox  process  (Wen et al., 2020,  Wu et al., 2020) . The a nammox  process  has been 
implemented in conjunction conventional nitrification and denitrification processe s. One  
important  set up involves  the partial nitrification (or nitritation) followed by  the anammox  
process  (PN/A).  As seen in Figure 5 , this can occur in a single tank or multiple reactor systems, 
both reporting similar total nitrogen ( TN) removal rates over 90  % (Jetten et al., 2009, You et 
al., 2020) . In this way, AOB produces nitrite  from ammonium in the influent. NOB activi ty is 
supressed . The anammox process  then combine s nitrite  and ammonium to produce  nitrogen 
gas, effectively removing nitrogen from the wastewater  (Wu et al., 2020) . A significant 
challenge posed by single  stage nitrogen r emoval is the suppression  of NOB , to prevent the 
full nitrification of ammonium to nitrate . Although inhibition and wash out strategies have 
been developed, none have proved reliable (Ni et al., 2016) .  
 
 
Figure 5: PN/A  process  in single and two staged systems  (Li et al., 2018)  
 
   
 
16 
 Nitrite is the limiting substrate in both natural and fabricated  environments, therefore it is 
important to increase the concentration of nitrite  of wastewater prior to feeding to the 
anammox tank (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . In the start- up procedure  of full -scale plants, 
granular biomass is obtained from the cultivation of mature lab and pilot scale reactors  is 
used to inoculate the full -scale plant , reducing the time until operation commences  (Wu et 
al., 2020, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Anamm ox plants also use anammox granular sludge or  
biomass  retained in plastic carriers.  The success of the world’s  first industrial scale anammox 
reactor is owed to the quantity  of high -density  granules with high settling velocities (Jetten et 
al., 2009) . Settling velocities of granules have been reported higher than 100m  s-1. This 
reduces the operation time for clarification steps , allowing for increased treatment efficiency 
(Wu et al., 2020) .  
 
1.2.8 Advantages and Disadvantages of Wastewater Treatment via Anammox Proce ss 
Disadvantages of anammox systems include the large quantities of biomass required for 
seeding, hindering its implementation (Wu et al., 2020) . The world ’s first anammox reactor in 
Rotterdam, The Netherlands, required over  3 years until it was operational (Ni et al., 2016) . 
Anammox  processes  will continue to compliment traditional denitrification and nitrification 
treatments  as a side stream process , as further investigation is required before it can be 
applied as a stand- alone  wastewater treatment process  (Wen et al., 2020) . 
However, the anammox process is a cost effective and ecofriendly approach to nitrogen removal from wastewater (Narita et al., 2017, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Because of the 
anammox metabolic pathway, oxygen demand is reduced by 60 %, organic carbon is no longer 
require d, and sludge production is reduced by 90 %. This results in substantial energy savings 
(Wen et al., 2020) . This reduced energy demand, combined with the anaerobic digestion of 
organic carbon makes energy or energy positive treatment plants a possibility  (Wen et al., 
2020, Wu et al., 2020) .  
    
 
17 
 1.3 Anammox Cultivation  in Bioreac tors 
1.3.1 Relationship between Reactor Operational  Parameters  and Growth  
Traditional microbial techniques are not optimal for the isolation of slow growing organisms 
(Jetten et al., 2009) . One of the features of a successful enrichment is the wash out of 
undesired bacteria, while retaining the desired species. This can be achiev ed by the 
application of a high flow rate, resulting in a short hydraulic retention time ( HRT) removing 
cells suspended in the supernatant (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . The solid retenti on time ( SRT) 
is how long biomass is retained in the reac tor and is linked to the growth rate  (μ). If the SRT 
is lower  than a bacteria’s  growth rate , it will be unable to replicate before  being washed out 
of the reacto r. This applies selection pressure to those bacteria that cannot grow faster than 
the SRT, resulting in the growth  and enrichment  of the desired bacteria well suited to the 
reactor environment. CSTRs with single cells are useful tools to control the bacterial growth  
since the dilution rate of the reactor (inverse of HRT) is equal to the growth rate of the culture.  
The SRT is a crucial parameter to control in bioprocesses, particularly for those involving slow 
growing bacteria (Reino Sanchez , 2016) . A minimum value of  SRT must be applied to increase 
the biomass concentration in the reactor. When SRT is too low , washout of desired species  
can occur (Jubany et al., 2009) . Membrane bioreactors  (MBR ) are presented as an effective 
tool for slow -growing bacteria. An  MBR allows for total retention of planktonic cells and are 
therefore an ideal tool for enrichment (Oshiki et al., 2013, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . In a an 
MBR it is possible to control the HRT and SRT independently , making it a popular configuration 
for enrichment (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Another cultivati on alternative is the use of a well -
mixed CST R. In these systems the HRT is equal to the SRT (Ding  et al., 2018) . 
 
1.3.2 Current Cultivation Strategies  
Typically, different reactors have been used for enrichment of anammox bacteria with different states of aggregation. While a sequencing batch reactor ( SBR) is useful for anammox 
granular biomass , upflow anaerobic bioreactors ( UAB ) are implemented for growth of 
annamox biofilms  and MBRs are the preferred tool for cultivating  anammox  planktonic cells  
(Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . The use of membranes retains the biomass in the reactor, resulting    
 
18 
 in longs SRTs. This is useful in counteracting the slow gr owth of anaerobic organisms such as 
anammox  bacteria . This results in the decoupling of SRT and HRT, allowing  low HRTs with high 
SRTs (Dong, 2015) . No relationship between the reactor type and enrichment of particular 
anammox species has been observed (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . Various reactor 
configurations and operational conditions  have resulted in different anammox enrichments. 
This ranges from 74 % in an SBR to 97.7 % purity in an MBR (Wu et al., 2020) . Ca. Jettenia, Ca. 
Brocadia and Ca. Scalindua have successfully been enriched in MBRs from granular biomass. 
These operations require a  considerable  time  investment typically between 100 and 200 days 
(Zhang et al., 2017b) . MBRs are also prone to fouling, and accumulated biomass must be 
periodically removed (Dong, 2015) . 
Despite the high enrichment achieved  in MBR s, the mechanisms are not well understood   
(Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . It was believed that anammox cultures could only be planktonically 
enriched in MBRs , but recently this has also been demonstrated in a CSTR (Ding et al., 2018) .  
 
1.3.3 Cultivation  in a CSTR  
A CSTR has been proposed as a promising  tool for anammox  bacteria cultivation, after the 
successful enrichment of Ca. Kuenenia stuttgartie nsis  in UFZ, Leipzig, Germany  (Ding et al., 
2018) . This study showed a rapid cultivation of a t culture to an enrichment  of 87% , with of a 
doubling time of just 3 days within 16 days of operation (Ding et al., 2018) . This is significantly 
faster  than the previously recorded of doubling times of 1 -2 weeks in MBRs (Ding et al., 2018, 
Oshiki et al., 2013) . A homogenous reactor effluent was attained, with a  cell density 
of 8.5 × 10 - 7 cells  mL-1 by day 30 (Ding et al., 2018) . 
 A CSTR is positioned as a superior tool for planktonic anammox enrichment. The 
straightforward design does away with a sludge pump or membrane system, allowing for a 
less complex system. The proliferation of planktonic cells in a CSTR is desirable to stud y the 
microbiology, physiology and biochemistry of anammox  bacteria  (Ding et al., 2018) . A 
disadvantage of CSTR operation is the inability to decouple HRT and SRT. The HRT therefore 
cannot be set above the growth rate at the risk of washing out desired microorganisms  (Ding 
et al., 2018) . It is very exceedingly difficult to operate  a CSTR with biomass at steady state, as    
 
19 
 the biomass produced must be equal to that washed out from the reactor . Care must also be 
taken not to operate too close to wash out conditions (Wittrup, 2007) . 
 
1.4 Planktonic Ca. Brocadia  cultivation i n a CSTR  
1.4.1 Strain Selection  
While  Ca. Scalindua are the most abundant ana mmox species in natural e nvironments , Ca. 
Brocadia species have been found to dominate in both municipal and industrial WWTPs (Chi 
et al., 2018, Kuenen, 2008, Oshiki et al., 2016) . However, there is  limited information 
regarding niche differentiation, kinetic parameters,  and the physiology of anammox  species, 
particularly  regarding  Ca. Brocadia fulgida.  Further research is a requirement to  better 
understand and optimise the process  for application in WWTPS . An additional reason for the 
selection of Ca.  Brocadia fulgida in this  enrichment project  was the ready availability of 
granules from  a steady and active SBR. No planktonic cultures enri ched in Ca.  Brocadia fulgida  
have previously been reported.  
 
1.4.2 Rational  for the  Planktonic Enrichment of Ca. Brocadia  in a CSTR  
With a clearly defined need for planktonic anammox cultures, new enrichment strategies are 
required. This approach is to investigate if the rapid enrichment and cultivation in a CSTR  can 
be replicated with a granular sludge inoculum of Ca.  Brocadia fulgida (Ding et al., 2018) . This 
approach will  also implement strategies reported from the successful start -up of planktonic 
Ca. Brocadia from a granular inoculum in an MBR (Oshiki et al., 2013) . A literatur e review 
unearthed no studies relating to the planktonic cultivation of Ca. Brocadia  in a CSTR, therefore 
this is an innovative approach. This culture could then be used for further biochemical and physiological studies optimise the application of  the anam mox  process , specifically Ca. 
Brocadia , in WWTPs.  
    
 
20 
 1.5 Objectives  
The importance of enriched planktonic cell cultures of anammox  bacteria  has been outlined 
above. The main aim of this project was to achieve the stable operation of a CSTR inoculated 
with Ca. Brocadia fulgida performing  the anammox process. The development of a planktonic 
cell culture, free from aggregations, was also pursued. Characterisation  of the culture was 
undertaken to investigate changes in microbial population and niche differentiation.  
     
 
21 
 2 Materials and Methods  
2.1 Reactor  
Choosing the appro priate reactor  is important consideration in any operation . A CSTR was 
selected as  an appropriate tool for cultivation  as it provided a homogenous outflow, could 
be easily controlled  and was affordable lab-scale configuration.  
2.1.1 Setup  
A lab scale CSTR  was operated in semicontinuous mode pursuing the anammox process . The 
vessel had a working volume of 1  L, a diameter of  10 cm and a height of 23.5 cm. The reactor 
had ports for medium exchange, sampling, pressure,  and temperature monitoring. All sensors 
were attached to a LabJack converter for data reading and storage. The monitoring and 
control were  via a Raspberry Pi m icroprocessor. The reactor set up can be seen in Figure 6  
and 7. A top -down view can be  found in Appendix 6 .1. Pressure due to gas accumulation  in 
the reactor headspace was constantly monitored. To prevent pressure build- up and potential 
breakage, an automatic valve was installed in the gas outlet. When pressure was recorded 
above 400 mV, this triggered the release valve to open for 5 sec releasing gas and reducing 
pressure in the vessel. Temperature was controlled through a heating blanket and 
thermometer to 32  °C ± 0.6  °C. The pH was not controlled, but monitored using a FiveEasy pH 
meter  (Mettler Toledo, Germany), and ranged between a pH of 7.0 and 8.4. No pH 
adjustments were needed. The DO concentration was monitored using adhesive sensors and 
Fitbox 4 Trace DO meter (PreSens, Germany). DO concentration was lowered, when required, 
throug h the intermittent addition of 100 mM Na 2SO3, which is an oxygen scavenger.

 Supernatant was  removed from the reactor (on days 41 and 77)  and replaced with fresh 
medium. The influent mediums  were  stored in a bottle flushed with nitrogen gas , however,  
DO was present in the medium and  was reduced through the  periodic  addition of Na 2SO3 to 
maintain  concentrations under 0.1 mg L-1. 
Ammonium was in excess to prevent a low redox potential and prevent accumulation of, and 
inhibition by nitrite. The reactor was fed a synthetic wastewater medium, described in 
Appendix 6.2. This medium  composition  was selected as it had been proven to be a suitable 
medium for the cultivation o f anammox  bacteria  in a CSTR.  
 
2.1.2 Inoculation  
The CSTR was inoculated with granules from an active SBR  anammox reactor operating in UFZ 
laboratories . The inoculum contained a mi xed culture, enriched in Ca . Brocadia fulgida. 
950 mL of anoxic medium was prepared, as described in Appendix 6.3. The medium was 
flushed for 45  minutes  with nitrogen  gas, without ammonium chloride , nitrite  and sodium  
bicarbonate , which was later added. Inoculation occurred inside an anaerobic tent to preven t 
oxygen inhibition. Granules were taken from the SBR, and supernatant was removed for a total volume of 50  mL. The remaining biomass was 7.5  mL, or approximately 5  g wet biomass. 
The biomass was then vortexed for 1 minute to facilitate cell detachment, before being 
inoculated into the medium. This can be seen in Appendix 6 .4. The reactor had initial 
concentrations  of 5 mM ammonium, 3  mM nitrite  with a pH of 7.81 and a DO concentration 
of 6 m g L
-1. The bioreactor was continuously mixed by a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm.  
 
2.1.3 Operation Conditions  
After 3 days, feeding commenced as nitrite levels had depleted.  The feeding was controlled 
by a P ython script via a Raspberry  Pi microprocessor.  This then operated the pumps , with the 
signal transferred via cables . Each cycle began with the removal of 4.1 7 mL of reactor 
contents . This was then replaced with 1.67  mL ammonium and 2.5  mL nitrite, so the reactor 
volume was maintained . Initially  the medium  was fe d every 2 hours. This resulted in a HRT of 
20 days, and an NLR of 6.35  mmol  day-1. Because the  ammonium medium was more    
 
24 
 concentrated than nitrite , (160 mM and 105  mM respectively)  the flow into the system was 
adjusted to maintain  a molar ratio of approximately 1: 1. This ratio was selected to prevent 
nitrite  accumulation in the reactor. Operation conditions varied throughout the operation in 
response to reactor performance  and were adjusted to  promote the growth of anammox  
bacteria . Cycle times were increased with feeding occurring every  8 hours on day 16 . This  
result ed in a HRT of 80 days. At time s, feeding was stopped due to perceived accumulation in 
the reactor . On day 41, it was decided the mediums should be diluted. This was to enable  a 
lower  NLR while maintaining a shorter  HRT. At this point, the cycle was also amended to 
feeding every 4 hours.  
 
2.2 Microbiological Techniques  
2.2.1 DNA Isolation  
DNA extraction was achieve d using the commercial PowerSoil  DNA kit (Qiagen, Germany) 
following the manufacturer protocol. Samples of biomass were taken from the inoculum and 
the final day of operation. The quality and quantity of DNA extracted was measured by 
NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti fic, USA). More d etails on DNA 
extraction  results can be found in A ppendix 6.5. 
 
2.2.2 Polymerase Chain Reaction  
DNA samples were amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Anammox specific 
bacterial genes were amplified using primer set  AMX649PF/AMX960RGC . The general 
bacterial primer pair 341FGC/518R12 was selected for 16s RNA gene s. The amplifications 
were performed with a 25  μL GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, Germany), comprising 
21.5 μL sterile water, 0.5  μL of both forward and reverse primers  with a concentration of 
10 μM, and 2.5 μL of DNA sample, for a total volume of 50  μL. Reactions were performed in 
the peqSTAR 2x Gradient Thermocycler (PreqLab, Germany) under the following thermal 
profile: 95 °C  for 2 min, then 38 cycles of 95  °C for 40s, 62  °C for 45s, 72  °C for 30 s, followed 
by one cycle of 72  °C for 5 min and 8  °C hold. Amplification of the DNA was then confirmed 
using Gel Electrophoresis. Supporting information can be found in  Appendix 6.6. A gel was    
 
25 
 prepared comprising 1  % agarose in a 100  mL 1x TAE Buffer and was then run at 100  V for 1  
hour . The gel was incubated and stained for 15 minutes  in a bath of Ethi dium bromide, then 
rinsed in water. The stained gel was then observed in the Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR (Bio -
Rad, Germany).  
 
2.2.3 Denaturi ng Gradient Gel Electrophoresis  
Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) is a molecular fingerprinting  technique used 
to analyse the composition, diversity, and dynamics of a microbial community. It separates 
PCR products based of differing sequence  composition. The bands with high guanine and 
cytosine (GC) content migrate further through the gel under increasingly denaturing conditions (Green et al., 2010) . A 70/30 high -low gradient gel was used in this procedure. It 
was run for 16 hours at 100  V in a 1x TAE buffer solution at 60  °C. The gel was incubated for 
30 minutes  with SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher, Germany) in  1x TAE, under gentle agitation. The 
gel was then viewed in the Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR (Bio -Rad, Germany ). Bands selected 
for subsequent sequencing were cut. DNA was extracted and amplified as described in section 2.2.2 above, then purified using the Wizard Purification Kit (Promega, Germany)  before 
sending for sequencing . 
 
2.2.4 Sequencing  
Sequencing was done by an external laboratory, utilising the overnight Mix2Seq Kit (EuroFins, German y) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. 15 μL of purified DNA sample and 
2 μL of forward and reverse primer were mixed in the tubes provided. The FASTA sequences 
obtained were then compared to those in the bacterial database available in National Center 
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the  Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). 
Results were filtered based of maximum score . A FASTA format is  a text -based represen tation 
of nucleotide or amino acid sequences.  
    
 
26 
 2.2.5 Cell Counting  
Cell counting was achieved through direct epifluorescence microscopic counting of SYBR -
green stained cells on agarose -coated slides. A homogenous 20 μL sample from the bioreactor 
was incubated with 2.6  μL of 100x diluted SYBR Green stock solution for 10 min utes  at room 
temperature, before being viewed under the microscope.  
 
2.2.6 Protein Determination  
Protein concentration was quantified by following the  Bradford Protein  Assay (Ernst and Zor, 
2010) . A calibration curve was established using Bovine Serum Albumin  (BSA) and Bradford 
Reagent (Bio -Rad, Germany ) was used to establish the protein content. The calibration  curve 
was prepared for each measurement . Each curve had an R2 value over 0.99 indicating low 
variance. A calibration curve can be seen in Appendix 6.7. Samples were taken of both the 
solids, and the supernatant after settling for 3 min. Cells were disrupted using a modified RIPA 
buffer  (150 mM sodium chloride ( NaCl ), 1 % Tween 20, 0.2 % SDS, 50  mM Tris (pH 7.4) ). 
Bradford reagen t was then added and the absorbance  at 450 and 590 nm was measured using  
Evolution 160 UV- Vis Spectrometer (Thermo Fischer, Germany).  The ratio between the  
wavelengths corresponded to the protein content of the sample.  
 
2.3 Analytical Techniques  
Ammonium was determined utilising column chromatography and measured  on an  UltiMate 
3000 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (Thermo Scientific, Germany). Nitrate 
was measured using on a Dionex DX -120 ion chromatographer (ThermoFisher, USA) equipped 
with an IonPac AS4A- SC (4 mm × 250 mm) column. The eluent was comprised of 0.7  mM 
sodium carbonate ( NaCO 3) and 0.7  mM sodium bicarbonate ( NaHCO 3) with a flow rate of 
1 mL min−1. Nitrite concentrations of the reactor could not be determined by i on 
chromatography due to the high chloride concentration of the medium, which resulted in 
overlapping peaks.     
 
27 
 Due to inconsistencies with nitrite  measurements , ammonium, nitrite and nitrate were all be 
determined  via ion chromatography using Dionex ICS -4000 (ThermoFis her, Germany) . 
Samples were diluted to between 1 and 20  mg L-1 of each compound before measurement .  
 
2.4 Calculations  
2.4.1  Anammox Process Ratios  
In order to investigate the consumption and production patterns of anammox bacteria 
during operation, several ratios were calculated .

2.4.2 Nitrogen Gas  Production  
The anammox process results in the production of nitrogen gas which accumulates in the 
headspace of the bioreactor. The headspace pressure was converted into an analogue 
electrical signal by a pressure transducer, providing an overview of the reactor’s activity. The 
output is measured in millivolts (mV) and correlates with the pressure in the headspace .  
The electrical signal must be converted to mols to determine the  nitrogen  produced. The 
pressure sensor was calibrated  by removing 5  mL medium from the reactor. A  pressure 
change of 137.5 mV was observed. 1 mL of  gas therefore  corresponds to 27.5 mV. From this 
measure it was possible to determine the volume  of gas produced each  day.  The ideal gas law  
(Equation 5) was used to calculate the m mol of gas produced.

To calculate the theoretical gas production of an ana mmox process within a period , the 
following calculation was solved: The molar ratio of 1.02  was derived from  Equation 1, that 1  
mmol nitrite  should stoichiometrically produce 1.02 mmol nitrogen gas  (1.02

Flow (Q) is inclusive of volume added as part of the cycle  and replaced during sampling . The 
initial concentration of the ammonium medium and nitrite  medium was 160 and 105 mM,  
respectively. The initial flow of each medium was 20  mL day-1 and 30  mL day-1 respectively. 
The volume of the reactor was 1  L.

 3 Results  and Discussion  
3.1 Operation al Conditions  and Microbial Activity  in the B ioreactor  
A lab -scale anammox CSTR was operated for 84  days treating a synthetic influent containing 
ammonium and nitrite in an appropriated ratio for anammox cultivation. DO concentration, 
pH and temperature (Figure 8 ) and nitrogenous compounds in the bulk liquid of the 
bioreactor were analysed periodically  throughout the entire operation (Figure 9). The influent 
flow rate, and thus, the NLR, were adjusted according to the performance of the bioreactor (Figure 10). In addition, the on- line measurement of the pressure in the headspace of the 
bioreactor allowed for the continuous follow -up of the activity, recorded as an electrical signal 
(Figure 11). Gas production (Figure 11)  was continuously measured  and automatically 
recorded. The standard deviations are cause d by multiple gas ‘releases’ per day  (when the 
pressure exceeds 400 mV).  
 
Figure 8: DO  concentration , pH and Temperature during CSTR operation  
 
 
During the operation of the CSTR, the temperature remained relatively constant (Figure 8). 
Days 11- 14 saw exceptionally warm weather, and the temperature control of the system was 
unable to maintain the set temperature of 32  °C. However, this brief period  of higher 
temperature was unlikely to have negatively affected the anammox  cells , as they are suited 
to a range of 27- 37 °C (Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . The temperature also cooled unexpectedly 
   
 
31 
 overnight on day 3 7 to about 28  °C, again remaining within a range suitable to anammox  
species , although a reduction in activity could have been expected. The pH was also 
maintained in appropriate values for anammox bacteria during the entire operation of the 
bioreactor. A sharp increase in pH was observed in the first week of operation which was 
consistent with denitrification and anammox  activity . From then  on it remain ed steady 
between 7.77 and 8.33, but from day 65 onwards , pH gradually decreased . This corresponded  
with a period of almost no activity  (Figure 11) . 
 DO concentration was always lower than 0.004  mg L
-1 for the first 65 days of operation.  From 
this po int, decreasing pH and loss of reactor activity correlated to an increasing DO  
concentration. On days 63, 70 and 84 Na 2SO3 (an oxygen scavenger) was added to the reactor 
to reduce DO concentration levels. This was only temporarily effective, as shortly after DO  
concentrations rose again.

the CSTR. Nitrite concentrations higher than 5  mM were plotted as red triangles.  
 
 
The concentrations of nitrite, nitrate and ammonium were measured throughout the 
operation to understand the activity and manage the reactor. Due to loss of linearity, it was not possible to determine the nitrite  when the concentration exceeded 5  mM. To th is end, 
when nitrite was too high to accurately measure  it has been indicated with the red triangle.

 Figure 10 above shows the NLR over the operation period. NLR is dependent on the flow and 
concentration of influent streams and accounts for the vessel volume. The initial medium 
concentrations where 160  mM ammonium and 105  mM nitrite  respectively. The initial flow 
was set to 50 m L day-1, resulting in an initial NLR of 6.35 mmol L-1 day-1. The inoculum was 
taken from a reactor with an NLR of 22 mmol L-1 day-1, however , this had a high volume of 
biomass,  so a lower initial NLR was selected. Over the operation period the flow was adjusted 
by increasing or decreasing the frequency of the feeding cycle from between 2 to 8 hours. Change s in the feeding cycle altered the NLR, and it varie d frequently throughout the 
operation.  
 
Flow was initially high, then decreased as accumulation was observed, especially when  the 
nitrite  concentration was high (Figure 10). Up to day 42, there was steady accumulation  of 
both nitrate  and ammonium in the reactor. Increasing ammonium  can be explained by 
ammonium being in excess to nitrite  reaction in an attempt to prevent nitrite  inhibition. Not 
all the ammonium  provided to the culture was expected to be consumed, and therefore 
slowly accumulated  within the bioreactor . Nitrate  levels were  also expected to increase 
because of  anammox activity.  
 
On day 42, the ammonium and nitrite  mediums were each diluted for a final concentration of 
92.6 mM and  60.8 mM respectively. This was done to increase the flow while maintaining the 
NLR. The aim  of increasing the flow (and therefore reducing the HRT) was to apply selective 
pressure for anammox  growth. In this way anammox  bacteria, which had sufficient substrates 
and suitable conditions for growth, would be able to multiply. They would be able to out -
compete other bacteria which would be unable to replicate before being washed out of the 
reactor. From day 64, the flow of ammonium was increased from 1 .67 to 2. 10 mL cycle-1 (due 
to a miscalculation). This excess ammonium was then clearly shown to acc umulate rapidly  
(Figure 9) . Feeding was  stopped on day 77 and the concentration of all nitrogen compounds  
declines.  
 Figure 11 sh ows the removal of biomass on day s 7 and 36 of the operation (2.5 mL and 1.5  mL 
respectively). Biomass was removed to facilitate the removal of granules from the reactor, to 
favour planktonic growth. On day 41, 300  mL fresh medium (with 6.6  mM nitrite and    
 
34 
 ammonium) was exchanged. It was hypothesised that perhaps the culture had consumed all 
a vitamin or mineral, as there was no significant activity, despite sufficient substrates will being available. In addition, 2.5  mL of biomass was taken from the initial SBR to reinoculated 
the reactor. This resulted in a short- lived increase in activity, which thereafter steadily 
decreased. 700 mL medium  without nitrogen compounds  was replaced on day 77 (retaining 
all the settled biomass) in order to dilute the substrates as high nitrite  concentrations were 
recorded. No significant activity was recorded after this point.  
 
During the operation period, it was observed that pressure increased slightly after each 
feeding cycle. Bicarbonate was used in the medium as an inorganic carbon source. Bicarbonate ( HCO
3-) exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide  as shown in Equation 8. Changes 
in temperature and concentration and pressure can alter the equilibrium (McMurray and Fay, 
2010) .  
𝐶𝐶𝑁𝑁2+𝑁𝑁2𝑁𝑁⇔𝑁𝑁++𝑁𝑁𝐶𝐶𝑁𝑁3− 
Equation 8: Equilibrium of  carbon dioxide  (CO 2) and bicarbonate ( HCO 3-) 
  
In addition, the solubility of carbon dioxide  in water decreases as temperature increases 
(Shapely, 2011) . Therefore, it is  possible that when additional medium was added to the 
reactor, this increased  the concentration of bicarbonate  when combined with the  increased 
temperature of the reactor , resu lted in a release of carbon dioxide  into the headspace. This 
would have been measured as an increase in pressure, that was not nitrogen gas. However, 
the effects of this were  minimal and it was only observed in period where the microbial 
activity was null, such as at the end of the operation.  
  
In nitrogen removal reactors, the  nitrogen removal rate  (NRR ) is typically discussed  in addition 
to the NLR . However, this operation never reached a steady state . Without a steady operation 
it is not possible to calculate this parameter. Although a hydraulic steady state was achieved 
for days at a time, the concentration of products and substrates was constantly changing due to extremely variable microbial activity. In addition, the possible production and consumption of biomass mak es the calculation of an NRR challenging . Instead , estimations of consumption 
were calculate d to evaluate  the anammox reaction, as can be seen in Table  2.    
 
35 
 3.2 Evaluation of Anammox Process   
The occurrence of anammox activity was evaluated considering the theoretical stoichiometry 
associated to the anammox process (Equation 1) . This section assesses the  consumption and 
production of the nitrogenous compounds involved in the anammox reaction utilising the  
nitrite to ammonium consumption ratio  (NO 2/NH 4+) and the nitrate produced to ammonium 
consumed ratio  (NO 3-/NH 4+). The operation was divided into six periods . These non -
consecutive  periods were selected based o n the availability of reliable data for calculations to 
provide an insight into reac tor activity over the operation. Various levels  of microbial activity 
were observed, and the main results associated to each period are discussed.  
 
The NO 2/NH 4+ molar ratio is the relationship between the consumption of the substrates. If 
anammox activity  were present, this ratio would be close to 1.3 2 as was stoichiometrically  
calculated. Table 2 shows the nitrite to ammonium consumption ratio during the different periods of operation. For almost all periods this value was lower than expected. This indicates 
that either that less nitrite  was consumed than expected, or a higher consumption of 
ammonium occurred. A higher -than- expected consumption of ammonium could be explained 
by the presence of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (nitrifiers) in the culture. Their g rowth was 
expected to be limited by the absence of oxygen, since nitrifiers are aerobic bacteria, however, some oxygen was expected to be present in the medium (despite flushing it 
periodically with nitrogen gas) allowing their growth.  
In addition, in Per iods 5 and 6, there as increasing oxygen in the system (Figure 9), which may 
have enhanced the nitrifying activity. This could also explain the low ratio at the end of the 
bioreactor operation (Table 2). The NO 3-/NH 4+ molar ratio represents the relationshi p 
between nitrate produced, for each mmol of ammonium consumed. With anammox activity, 
this should have been 0.26, although revised stoichiometry has placed this figure closer to 0.16 (Wu et al., 2020).  A negative ratio is caused by a consumption of nitrate. This was a clear 
indication that there were denitrifiers within this culture, as the anammox metabolism only produces, not consumes nitrate.

 3.3 Nitrogen Gas Production by Anammox Bacteria  
The first period had the highest activity of the entire operation with 5.6  mmol -N being 
consumed each day. This period was also characterised by the highest gas production. 
Thereafter, activity steadily decreased until day 20. The remainder of the operation was far 
less active, as was  confirmed by the gas production shown in Figure 11.  
 
The anammox reaction result s in the pr oduction of nitrogen gas. Hence, it was  possible to 
calculate the expected nitrogen gas  production based of ammonium consumed, according to 
the theoretical stoichiometry of the anammox process (Equation 1 ). The expected ratio was 
1.02 mmol nitrogen gas  for each mmol ammonium consumed. All periods  had lower 
production than expected, except period  2. This could indicate that anammox activity was 
low in the reactor and other bacterial activities were taking place . It was hypothesis ed that 
some  gas production was the result of heterotrophic denitrification,  which also produce s 
nitrogen gas as seen in Equation 9.

 This process also produces c arbon dioxide  which could also contribute to increasing pressure. 
The experimental set up was  not able to differentiate between gas types  or which process 
produces the gas. This limits the ability to draw relationships between the anammox activity 
and gas production.   
 
3.4 Loss of anammox activity  
As observed in Figure 11 , there were two periods when anammox activity was detected but 
gradually decreased (between days 0 –20 and 41 –60). The first one was at the starting up of 
the reactor, the second one when fresh cells were added. At the end of the operation the 
activity was null.  The main hypothesis behind the los s of activity was the nitrite inhibition. 
Some activity was observed after adding fresh anammox cells in the reactor, but activity was    
 
38 
 subsequently lost, and substrates accumulated. During the operation, nitrite  concentrations 
were often so  high  that they likely inhibited growth (Figure 9). 
 
When nitrite levels exceed a certain threshold, activity can be inhibited. Inhibi tion levels vary 
due operation conditions such as NLR, biomass aggregation state, length of exposure and the 
health of the culture . This poses a challenge to determine inhibition levels during operation 
(Wen et al., 2020) . There is consid erable debate as to whether nitrite inhibition is  irreversible 
and at what level  (Lotti et al., 2012, Wen et al., 2020) . It can also be difficult to determine 
whether high nitrite levels resulted from inhibition and the resultant lack of nitrite 
consumption, or high nitrite conditions were responsible for inhibition (Lotti et al., 2012) . 
From literature, partial inhibition has been observed when nitrite  concentrations exceeded 
3.57 mM and total inhibi tion was observed at nitrite  levels over 7.14 mM (Wu e t al., 2020, 
Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . In this study, nitrite  concentrations within the reactor were 
frequently above these values, contributing to reduced activity.  
 In natural environments, anammox bacteria are able to exploit low substrate concentrations 
(Jetten et al., 2009, Zhang and Okabe, 2020) . (Oshiki et al., 2013)  theorises that a low 
substrate concentration prom otes the growth of planktonic cells, due to the limitations of 
substrate transport in aggregations. Therefore, the high concentrations in this operation would have been counterproductive to both growth and the establishment of a planktonic culture. However , substrates and nutrients must be present for exponential growth phase, 
and substrate limitation should be avoided to prevent undue stress on new cells (Zhang et al., 
2017b) . 
 
At the end of the operation, the combination of decreasing pH and increasing DO concentration corresponds to a loss of activity in the reactor. The pH levels where never 
inhibitory for anammox bacteria, and instead are an indicator of the loss of activity and  
reduced consumption of H
+ ions. Anammox  bacteria have reported inhibition of 50  % from 
just 0.03 mg O 2 L-1 – 3.8 mg O 2 L-1 (Yan et al., 2020) . Inhibition by oxygen is also reversible (Yan 
et al., 2020) . This rising oxygen level  could have led  to the inhibition of anammox  bacteria and 
denitrification activity , which are  inhibited 35  % with a DO concentration of 0.09 mg  L-1, 
compounding the loss of activity (Oh and Silverst ein, 1999) .     
 
39 
 During the operation, it was observed that the biomass lost its colour. The inoculum was a 
vibrant pinkish orange  but as the operation proceeded, the biomass loses its characteristic 
colour, appearing a greyish pink  (Figure 12). Cytochrome C is the compound responsible for 
the pink colour. The deeper the red observed and measured in the culture's  hue is found to 
have a positive correlation to anammox activity (Kang et al., 2018) . This bright colour also 
been observed in the operation of highly active anammox cultures, operating in in an SBR within the laboratory  (Appendix 6.8).  
 
  
Figure 12: Biomass  at re -inoculation day 42 (left) and day 70 (right)  
 
 
 Nitrifiers , which also  have a typical orange -brown colour , were thought to be  present in the 
culture . When oxygen is limiting, they are reported to turn brown or black (Alleman and 
Preston, 1992) . This did not occur, possibly because the population was only minor 
component of the culture and there was sufficient oxygen from medium inflow, but they  
could have contributed overall colour of the reactor’s  biomass .  
 
3.5 Bacterial Growth  
Bacterial growth was monitored through the operation. The CSTR was inoculated with 
granular biomass. Overtime it was hoped that this would breakdown due to  agitation , and 
when combined with the growth of new planktonic cells , the overall composition of the 
reactor would shift from granular biomass to plan ktonic . This strategy been  achieved in an 
   
 
40 
 MBR, as  seen in Appendix 6 .9. The extent of the shift from granular to planktonic aggregation 
states  was observed  by measuring the protein content of the supernatant and settled solids  
in combination with cell counting .  
 
 
Figure 13: Cell Counting and Protein Composition  
 
 
Cell counting was undertaken during operation to observe cell growth. During the first 3 
weeks of the operation, there wa s an increase in the cell count, increasing from 1.7  x 107 cells 
mL-1 on day 1, to 3. 3 x 107  cells mL-1 on day 24, before decreasing. After dilution (day 42), the 
cells had a concentration of 1. 5 x 107 cells mL-1. On day 72, 3.0 x 107 cells mL-1 was measured. 
On the last day of operation, the cell count had dropped to 8.6 x 106 cells mL-1. This decrease 
was likely  due to the me dium exchange on day 77 . A planktonic cell culture was not 
established during the operation.  
 
One limitation of cell counting is that it is not easy to differentiate between anammox  cells  
and other cells. Anamm ox cells appear after  staining to be a C shape due to the  presence of 
Protein content ( μg mL-1)    
 
41 
 the anammox osome, which contains no DNA (van Niftrik and Jetten, 2012) . This shape was 
not observed (Appendix 6 .10). It was  therefore possible that nitrifiers and denitrifiers were 
growing in addition to anammox  bacteria. A hypothesis for the growth patterns observed 
could be explained by  the presence of nitrifiers in the culture. They consumed any oxygen in 
the medium, keeping levels low for the first period  of the operation. They were then unable 
to grow due to lack of oxygen, eventually becoming inactive, which led  to an increasing DO 
concentration within the reactor. This increased DO concentration could have hindered 
planktonic anammox  cells , promoting granulation, or inhibiting growth. This was supported 
by the observation of biofilm and flocs formation  in the bioreactor.  
 
Denitrifiers were also  thought to  present in the community. As  fast-growing  heterotrophs, 
they could have outcompeted the anammox  species , increasing the cell count  within the 
reactor. Once all the organic matter was consumed (from dead cells), growth would have to cease. This could explain the initial growth of planktonic cells in the culture .  
 
Changes in the aggregation states of the biomass were  also monitored (Figure 1 3). This was 
achieved by protein determination  of solid s, comprising of settled biomass, and supernatant. 
The protein content of cells that were present as granules or biomass increased  slightly  over 
a 2-week period, from 101. 7 μg mL-1 to 110.8  μg mL-1. The protein content of the supernatant 
also increased  from 98.8  μg mL-1 to 106.1 μg mL-1. This could indicate that growth was 
occurring, though whether this was anammox bacteria or other bacteria, cannot be 
determined. A distinct shift from granular to single cells was not observed, with granular 
biomass increasing at a faster rate than planktonic cells. Cell counting and supernatant 
protein determination on day 65 were both unexpectedly low, perhaps due to an error in 
sampling.  
 
It has been theorised that the activity of anammox bacteria could depend on cell density, 
through quorum sensing, with increased activity being observed at higher densities (above 
1010 cells mL-1 (Oshiki et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020) . The lack of a high cell density could 
therefore also contribute to the limited anammox a ctivity

 3.6 Microbial Characterisation  
DGGE is a microbial fingerprinting technique that was used for observing changes in 
community diversity over time. This, in combination with sequencing allows for observations about the microbial community present in the reactor.

43 
 Table 3 above shows the sequencing results after cutting the gel bands indicated in F igure 14. 
The full FASTA sequence can be found in Appendix 6.11 The positive control was taken a 
culture of Ca. Kuenenia stuttgarti ensis that was successfully enriched to 87  % (Ding et al., 
2018) . All parameters indicating a match between query sequence and the database are high, 
demonstrating a good correlation and high degree of certainty in the identification.  
 
From the sequencing result, the dominant bands were associated with anammox bacteria, specifically Ca. Brocadia. Bands 6 and 10 were also associated with Ca. Brocadia fulgida 
EU478693.1 . This was expected, as the culture was inoculated with an enriched cul ture of Ca. 
Brocadia fulgida. Bands 6 and 7 were the most intense bands, therefore most abundant in 
the culture. An enrichment of anammox DNA in bands 8 and 9 was  observed over the 
operation period. It was thought that perhaps band 9 would indicate Ca. Kuenenia, as this was 
in a similar position to the dark band of the positive control lane, but the species of anammox was undefined. In contrast, a loss of band 10 was observed. Overall, there were  limited  
changes in microbial community,  which is consistent with slow growing anaerobic 
populations (Wen et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020) . A limitation of PCR and subsequent DGGE is 
that it assesses  the DNA of the whole full population both dead and alive. This could result in 
the amplification of biomass that died at the beginning of the operation which was still 
present in the reactor on day 84 . This w ould also contribute to the limited shift in population 
changes.  
 
Although only anammox DNA was shown from the sequencing results, it was expected  that 
denitrifiers were present in the initial inoculum. Band 3, which comes from  a DNA sample of  
the same SBR  that provided the inoculum  (but from an earlier date than inoculation)  
corresponded to Pseudomonas, a common denitrifying bacteria.   The separation between bands when anammox specific primers were used was not 
successful.  A different denaturing gradient should be applied for preparing the DGGE gel in 
further experiments. These  bands could not be cut and used for sequence identification. They 
do however confirm the presence of anammox bacteria in the community . Furthermore , the 
position of the bands agrees with Ca . Brocadia  when comparing with previous experiments 
performed in our labs.     
 
44 
 4 Conclusions  
 
A CSTR was operated for 84 days to establish a  planktonic culture enriched in Ca. Brocadia 
fulgida, h owever, s table  operation of the  anammox  process  in a CSTR  was not achieved. Due 
to lack of activity, the decision was made to stop reactor operation.  
 
The culture was only active after the addition of biomass , thereafter anammox activity was 
lost as observed through reduced gas production and loss of biomass colour. Several factors 
were  hypothesi sed as the cause of activity loss , including inhibition by high nitrite  
concentrations . Although a hydraulically stable operation was achieved, the complexity of a 
bioreactor made it impossible to fully calculate  nitrogen mass balances. This presented a 
challenge to calculat ing the reactor activity and kinetic parameters.  
 
Bacterial growth was observed, as determine d by cell counting and protein determination.  
However , this could not be conclusively linked with anammox  cells . The difficulties in 
enriching planktonic cultures of anammox  bacteria have been well documented, due to slow 
growing times  and complex microbial interactions . Ca. Brocadia also has a high ag gregation 
tendency , perhaps in  response to a lower tolerance  to environmental stressors. This could 
also pose additional challenges to planktonic cultivation.   
 
Sequencing showed that the culture was enriched with anammox  bacteria, with very few 
changes in the microbial community . The DGGE procedure should also be optimised for the 
anammox specific primers, such as altering the denaturing gradient and shortening the running time. This could provide clearer insights into the anam mox community. From 
consumption and production patterns of nitrogen compounds, it was highly likely that other 
microorganisms were also present in the reactor.

 Overtime it was hoped that biomass would breakdown due to agitation. This would promote 
the growth of new planktonic cells, and the overall composition of the reactor would shift 
from granular biomass to planktonic, as can be seen in this figure from planktonic cul tivation 
of Ca. Brocadia in an MBR (O shiki et al., 2013)
