Abstract: The environmental challenge of syntheti c azo dyes is of increasing concern du e to the serious health effects on 
animals and human being. Metanil yell ow (monosodium salt of 4-m-sulphopheny lazodiphenylamine) was selected as 
the model compounds for this study because of its wide application in various textile industries either as such or in 
combinations with some other dyes as color additives. The azo dye degradation with electrochemical method in 
aqueous solution has been studied with platinum and steel electrode. A well–defined irreve rsible cathodic peak at -
0.293 V was obtained and this may be attributed to the reduction of azo (–N=N-) group. Results indicate that the 
electrode process is diffusion controlled. Number of elec tron transferred was calculated and is found to be 4e and 
reduction mechanism proposed. During controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) peak  current reduced s ubstantially with 
a considerable decrease in color and absorbance. The reaction follows a first order dependence with k values 2.41 x 10
-2 abs min-1 and 2.30 x 10-2 abs min-1 at platinum and steel foil respectively. The efficiency of different electrode 
materials for color removal is compared. Chemical oxyg en demand (COD) decreases substantially from 2160 ppm to 
180 ppm at platinum (91.7% COD remova l) and 292 ppm at steel electrode (86. 5% COD removal). No peak could be 
observed in the voltammograms after CPE, indicating the absence of any electroactive breakdown products. 
Key words:  Metanil Yellow, Azo dye, Electrochemical treatment, Waste water, CPE, COD. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Dye wastewater usually contains of a number of contaminants including acids, bases, dissolved 
solids, toxic compounds, and colored materials which are noticeable even at very low 
concentrations and must be removed before the wa stewater can be discharged. Azo dyes constitute 
an important class of synthetic, colored, or ganic compounds, which are characterized by the 
presence of one or more azo bonds (–N=N–). They represent about 50% of the worldwide dye 
production and are widely used in a number of industries, such as textile dyeing, food, cosmetics, 
paper printing, with the textile industry as the la rgest consumer (Ollgaard et al. 1999; Gomez et al. 
2003). 
It is reported that approximately 5 tonne of dye discharge from dyes and coloration industries 
every year (Brown, 1987). A number of physical and chemical techniques have been reported for 
the removal of dye compounds such as adsorption (Walker and Weatherley, 1999; Moura et al. 2003), biological treatment (Lee and Pavlostathis , 2004), chemical precip itation (Sarasa et al. 
1998), photocatalytic (Prevot et al. 2001; Jain et al. 2008), electrochemical  methods (Gupta et al. 
2007; Jain et al. 2006; Jain et al. 2007; Fan et al. 2008; Jain et al. 2009), ozonation (Ciardelli and 
Ranieri, 2001) and Fentons’ reaction (Meric et al. 2004). Electrochemical tec hniques are considered 
as an attractive methodology for the treatment of dyeing wastewater due to its significant 
advantages viz. wide application, simple equipment, easy operation, lower temperature 
requirements and no sludge formation (Daneshvar et al. 2004; Do and Chen, 1994; Gutierrez and Crespi, 1999; Vlyssides et al . 1999; Lorimer et al. 2000).

 Metanil yellow (monosodium salt of 4-m-sulphophenylazodiphenylamine) is an acidic azo dye 
(Figure 1). It is a monoazo dye having CI name acid yellow 36 and comes under the trade name of 
external drug and cosmetic (D&C) Yellow No.1.

These dyes are released in efflue nts from textile, leather, shoe polish, wood stain, paper, food 
and cosmetic industries. Despite the ban as food colo uring agents in many countries, these dyes is 
frequently used as a food additive in many yellow orange coloured eatables mostly in India (Khana 
et al.1985). Metanil yellow has shown to promote tumor enhanci ng effects (Gupta et al. 2003), 
cause testicular damage in gametogenic elements to  arrest spermatogenesis in guinea pigs, rats and 
mice (Khanna and Das, 1991), induced haematologic al changes (Prasad and Rastogi, 1983), effect 
DNA synthesis (Sundarrajan et al. 2001) and a case of allergic contact dermatitis due to metanil 
yellow was also reported by Hausen, 1994.  
Photocatalytic degradation (Sleim an et al. 2007) technique is avai lable for degradation of metanil 
yellow from environmental samples. Metanil yell ow azo dye has electroactive groups but its 
electrochemical behavior or their treatments have not been inves tigated. In the present study, the 
electrochemical treatment of a hazardous azo dye metanil yellow from industrial wastewater was 
investigated and the treatment  performance was optimized using electrochemical methodology. 
Results have been analyzed employing the criterion of complete decolour isation and reduction in 
toxicity of the dye. 
2. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND METHODS 
2.1 Instrumentation 
Cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies were carried out on EG & G potentiostat of Princeton Applied 
Research integrated with applied electrochemistry software. Voltammograms were recorded by 
cycling the working electrode potential between –1. 20 V to +1.20 V at differe nt at different sweep 
rates (50 - 2000 mV s-1). The electrochemical cell consisted of three-electrode system placed 1.0 cm 
apart from each other and directly dipped in the solution to be electrolyzed. Voltammetric behavior 
was studied using platinum as working electrode, SCE as reference and platinum wire as counter 
electrode. Controlled potential electrolysis was carried out using BAS CV-27 cyclic voltammograph in connection with the digital electronic 2000 Omnigraph x-y/t
 recorder. The working electrodes 
used for controlled potential electrolysis (CPE ) were platinum foil of surface area 3x3 cm2 and steel 
foil having 4.5 x 3.5 cm2 surface areas. Ag/AgCl was taken as the reference electrode and platinum 
wire as counter electrode.  
Differential pulse polarographic (DPP) meas urements were carried out on Elico pulse 
polarograph (model CL 90) connected with Polaro cord recorder (model LR-108). Triple distilled 
mercury was used for the DME. The capil lary had a flow ra te of 3.02 mg s-1 together with drop time 
of 3 seconds. The pH metric measurements were  made on Hach digital EC-40 Benchtop pH/ISE 
meter. The absorption spectra of samples were recorded on UV-Visible spectrophotometer (model 
Elico SL I59). The chemical oxygen demand (COD)  was determined with the open reflux method 
using COD digester apparatus (m odel Spectralab 2015-S). The synthetic azo dye metanil yellow 
was purchased from Aldrich USA.  European Water 27/28 (2009)   45 
 2.2 Reagents and materials 
2 x 10-3 M of stock solution of metanil yellow was prepared by dissolving accurately weighed 
quantity of compound in double distil led water. In order to evaluate the effect of varying pH, BR 
buffers in the pH range 2.5 - 12.0 were prepared  as per literature method (Britton, 1956). The 
solutions for recording voltammograms were prepared by mixing appropriate volume of stock 
solution and distilled water/buffer of varying pH. Supporting electrolyt e was 1.0 M KCl. For 
carrying out the COD experiments reagents were prepared in accordance to standard methods 
(APHA, 1995). 
2.3 Procedure 
The cyclic voltammetric and differential pulse polarographic studies of metanil yellow was 
carried out by mixing 1.0 mL of potassium ch loride, 1.0 mL stock so lution and 8.0 mL of 
appropriate BR buffer/distilled water. Solutions of different concentrations were prepared in distilled water/buffer for CV and DPP studies. Dissolved oxygen was removed from the solution by 
passing nitrogen gas for about 10  minutes. The polarograms and cy clic voltammograms were then 
recorded. The redox behavior was studied at vary ing pH range of 2.5 to 12.0 and scan rates from 
100 to 2000 mV s
-1. Controlled potential electrolysis of the dye solution was performed at slightly 
more negative potential than the peak potential of  the respective peak. Absorbance of the solution 
was measured at different time intervals. The value of rate constant k was calculated from the log 10 
(absorbance) vs time plots. The number of electrons transf erred was calculated from the decrease in 
current with time during electrolysis. Controlled potential coulometry was also carried out at 
different pH values. The progress of elect rolysis was monitored by recording cyclic 
voltammograms at regular intervals of time. The e nd products of the electrolysis were identified by 
TLC. For COD studies, the experiments were  carried out as per standard methods. 
2.4 Coulometry 
For the coulometric determination of number of  electrons 'n' consumed in the reduction, a 
solution of depolarizer, potassium chloride and buffer/distilled water was mixed in the same ratio as 
for cyclic voltammetric and polarographic studies. The solution was de-aerated by passing nitrogen 
gas for 10 mins and cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a negative potential slightly higher 
than the peak potential. With the progress of el ectrolysis the color of the solution gradually faded 
and finally a colorless solution was obtained. The current decreas es exponentially with time and 
using coulometer, value of Q was read and by app lication of Q = nFN, the value of ‘n’ could be 
calculated and found to be 4.0. 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
3.1 Cyclic Voltammetric (CV) studies 
The cyclic voltammogram of metanil yellow in distilled water exhibits a reduction peak at -
0.293V and a corresponding oxidation peak at -0.697 V at 50mV s-1 scan rate. As the scan rate was 
increased, the cathodic peak potential showed ne gative shift and oxidation  peak potential showed 
positive shift. The difference between E pc and E pa (ΔEp) decreased gradually with increasing scan 
rate. At the higher s can rate of 2000mV s-1, Epc and E pa are -0.363V and -0.743V respectively. The 
cathodic peak can be safely assigned to the re duction of azo (-N=N-) group. The separation of 
reduction and oxidation peak is greater than 0.059/n volts which pointed towards irreversible nature of the electrode process. Irreversibility occurs wh en the relative rate of electron transfer with 46 R. Jain et al. 
 respect to the mass transport was insufficient to maintain Nernstian equilibrium at the electrode 
surface. The voltammograms recorded were more sp read out and flatter wh ich also supported the 
irreversible nature of the electrode process. As the scan rate (ν ) is increased, the reduction peak 
potential shows negative shift and oxidation p eak potential shows positive shift suggesting the 
irreversible nature of the elec trode process. The plot of i pc vs υ1/2 in the 6.5 pH solu tion is a straight 
line passing through the origin indicating diffus ion controlled nature of the electrode process 
(Figure 2) indicates diffusion controlled nature of the electrode process.

electrode, conc = 2 x 10-4 M. 
3.2 Effect of pH 
The shape and characteristics of voltammograms were strongly dependent on the pH of the 
medium. Well-defined cathodic pe aks in acidic pH range are obtained with both platinum and 
glassy carbon electrodes. The cathodic peak shifts towards negative potential and anodic peak 
potential exhibits positive shift with increasing pH , which indicates that prot on transfer occurs as a 
step consecutive to an irreversib le electrode process. The potenti al of cathodic peak of metanil 
yellow is shifted linearly towards more negative values with increasing the pH between 2 and 6.5. 
At pH > 6.5, the E pc is pH independent. The linear regions of the E pc – pH plot intersect at about 6.5 
(Figure 3), a value which is in accord with the pKa value. This indicated the reduction of 
unprotonated species. These results  are presented in Table 1. European Water 27/28 (2009)   47

3.3 Differential pulse polarographic studies 
A single four-electron irreversible reduction peak  is observed in the pH range 2.5 to 12.0 at 
mercury electrode. This may be attributed to re duction of the azo group (-N=N-). The shift in E p 
towards more cathodic potential with  pH with a break at pH 6.5 wa s observed and after that there 
was constancy in E p till pH 6.5 suggesting the participation of protons in rate determining step.

3.4 Controlled potential  coulometric studies 
The number of electrons involved in cpe were dete rmined at different pH and in neutral aqueous 
medium. The value of ‘n’ was foun d to be 4.0 ± 0.2 for neutral medium and at various pH. The 
progress of electrolysis was monitored by recording decrease in current (i pc) with time. The current 
decreases exponentially with time during CPE, at both platinum foil and steel  foil electrodes,(Table 
2) till only background current  was realised (Figure 5). 
Reduction peak of metanil yellow in aqueous neutral medium as well as at varying pH, 
disappeared within 1-3 hours of electrolysis leading to the decolourisation of the dye solution. The 48 R. Jain et al.

working electrode is de picted in Figure 6.

3.5 Spectral studies 
UV-visible spectra of metanil yellow (conc. 2x10-4 M) at distilled water were recorded at λmax 
475 nm. The progress of controlled  potential electrolysis was mo nitored by recording spectral 
changes at different time intervals. Absorbance sy stematically decreased with the progress of 
electrolysis. The absorbance measurement for before  electrochemical treatm ent and after treatment 
is depicted in Figure 7. The kinetics of deco lourisation was followed by recording changes in 
absorbance with time at select ed wavelengths. The kinetics of  decolourisation was found to be 
varying with initial dye concentration. Using linear log A t Vs time (t) plots, the reaction was found 
to be obeying I order rate expression both in cas e of steel and platinum foil working electrodes. 
First order rate constants for electrochemical reduc tion at steel foil and plat inum foil electrodes are 
presented in Table 3.

 3.6 Chromatographic studies 
After cpe, thin layer chromatographic studies were carried out on decolorized/-electrolyzed 
solution of metanil yellow in aqueous medium. It was observed that electrol yzed solution exhibited 
two spots in acetone-water system (9:1) leading to  the conclusion that two decomposition products 
were formed after electrolysis at  - 1.20V. The end products were fu rther identified by GC-MS. The 
mass spectrum of the electrolyzed  solution clearly exhibits follo wing molecular ion peak and 
fragment ion peak.

Note: Being highly polar, the SO 3Na group could not be retained by the column of GC 
hence, could not be detected in the peak. 
3. m/z = 185 
3.7 COD removal 
The chemical oxygen demand test is widely used  as an effective technique to measure the 
organic strength of wastewater. The test allows the measurement of waste in terms of the total 
quantity of oxygen required for the oxidation of organic matter to CO 2 and water. In the present 
work results of chemical oxygen demand were taken as one of the parameter to judge the feasibility 
of the electrochemical process for the degradation of metanil yellow dye solution.The 
electrochemical degradation of the azo dye, metanil yellow was carried out at different experimental 
conditions. After electrolysis comp letely decolourise effluent with  substantial reduction in COD 
value was obtained. The dye solution (2 x 10-4 M) in distilled water gets completely decolourised in 
an hour with complete disappeara nce of reduction (ip,c) and oxidati on peak (ip,a). At different pH, 
no peak was observed in electrolysed solution implyi ng complete reduction of chromophoric group. 
The rate kinetics was also monitored during electr olysis and it was observed that reaction follows 
first order rate. Comparison of the COD value of th e initial dye solution with electrolysed solution 
indicates the COD value is substantially reduced . It is observed that the COD value shows a 
significant decrease from 2160 mg L-1 to a final value of 180 mg L-1 at platinum and 2160 mg L-1 to 
292 mg L-1 at steel electrodes indicating less toxicity of the related products in comparison to the 
original dye and good potential of employing electrolytic technique.  
3.8 Proposed mechanism 
On the basis of the results of coulometry, contro lled potential electrolysis, chromatographic and 
spectral analysis following reduction mechanism (Fig ure 8) is postulated. During the reduction, the 
polarized molecule formed in the first step takes a proton from the medium  and gets protonated to 
form (B). The next step is slow and rate de termining in which the reduction of azo group -N=N- 
takes place by intake of two electrons (2e) giving hydrazo moiety and resulting in the formation of 
(C). In step III, (C) hydrazo moiety consumes two electrons and a proton resulting into the two 
decomposition products (D) and (E) having m/z of 93 and 185. This mechanism of reduction of azo 
dye is also supported by GC-MS results. 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
The electroactivity of metanil yellow on different electrode material has established and studied 
for the first time. The electrochemical reduction of metanil yellow under the conditions described in 
this work is an irreversible process controlled  by diffusion. Both platinum and steel electrodes 
exhibit great stability and resistant to redox a nd acidic/basic environments showing no deactivation. 
During the electrochemical degradation process the COD decreases by approximately 91.7% at European Water 27/28 (2009)   51 
 platinum electrode and 86.5% at steel foil electr ode with complete color removal. The developed 
electrochemical treatment is in good agreement with the already reported photocatalytic degradation 
method (Sleiman et al. 2007). The proposed elec trochemical procedure is a good alternative 
approach for wastewater treatment with considerable lowering of toxicity.
