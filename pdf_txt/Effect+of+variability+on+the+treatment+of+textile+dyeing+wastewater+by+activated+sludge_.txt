Introduction  
 
Water pollution has gained a paramount 
importance due to the industrial effluents. 
Textile industries consume large quantities of 
water in wet processing operations generating 
huge quantities of dyestuffs.  
 
More than 10,000 dyes are used in the textile 
industry and approximately 28,000 tonnes of 
dyes are being discharged into the public 
drains without proper treatment that 
eventually go into the river (Hsueh et al.,  
2005 ). 10% of dyes are lost during coloration 
process and 2% of these are directly 
discharged in aqueous effluent (Easton, 1995 ). 
Azo dyes are widely used among synthetic dyes in the textile industry and represent about 
80 % of commercial dyes produced in the 
world with an annual production of 
7×105tonnes (Fu and Viraraghavan, 2001 ). 
The concentration of dyes in wastewater from 
textile dyeing industry can vary from 10 to 
250 mg/l (O’Neill et al.,  1999 ) whereas in 
another research it was reported that the 
concentrations may as high as 1,500 mg/l 
(Pearce et al.,  2003 ).  
 
The release of these dyes in large quantities is 
a serious threat to the environment. Besides  
aesthetic and problem towards photosynthetic 
process, azo dyes also have an adverse impact 
in term s of total organic carbon (TOC), 
biological oxygen demand (BOD) and Nowadays, synthetic dyes are widely used in textile, leather , cosmetics, paper, food and 
pharmaceutical industries instead of natural dyes due to its availability, stability, low cost 
and color intensity which emerges a new problem of residual color in the discharged 
effluent. Improper discharge of dye effluent in aqueous ecosystems is aesthetically 
unpleasant and impedes photosynthetic activity reducing sunlight penetration, dissolved 
oxygen concentration and water quality in total. Recalcitrant azo dyes which are mostly 
used in textile industries are not exhaustiv ely removed from effluent by the existing 
effluent treatment plant. Biological method has gained momentum over physical and 
chemical process to remove color of dyes because of economic viability, ecofriendly and 
suitable for wide range of dyes. This review  primarily focuses on color removal efficiency 
of different organisms, its mechanism and several responsible physicochemical parameters 
for dye removal.  K e y w o r d s

 chemical oxygen demand (COD) (Saratale et 
al., 2009 ) and many of its metabolites are 
toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic (Myslak 
and Bolt, 1998 ). Moreover various research 
reveal that the to xic effects of dyes have a 
major influence over the germination rates and 
biomass of several plant species (Ghodake et 
al., 2009 ). As a result, treatment of industrial 
dye effluents and their metabolites is 
necessary prior to their final discharge to the 
environment. Therefore this topic is gaining 
great interest of many researchers to study the 
pros and cons of color removal.  
 
There are three methods to treat the industrial 
effluent such as physical, chemical and 
biological method. Physical method involve  
the use of bio -sorbents, coagulants and 
filtration techniques. Activated carbon, 
alumina, silica gel, clays, chitin, chitosan, 
zeolite, rice husk, orange peels, peat, sawdust, 
red mud, maize cobs, fly ash, and bagasse pith 
which are known as bio -sorbents,  are being 
used to remove dyes from waste water (Gupta, 
2009 ).  
 
The most drawback of solid adsorbents is that 
adsorbents contain toxic dyes on their surfaces 
generating sludge as secondary pollutant solid 
waste. Chemical methods such as ozonation, 
fenton oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, 
ultrasonic chemical oxidation and irradiation 
oxidation has limited usability for the 
treatment of dyes due to high cost of the 
electricity, radiation, and ozone (Pearce et al.,  
2003; Esteves and Silva, 2004 ). On the o ther 
hand, microorganisms for decolorizing dyes 
effluent is considered relatively cost effective.  
 
Moreover biological treatment are eco -
friendly because it exhaustively removes 
pollutants from the effluent. In this review, we 
will discuss about the diffe rent processes of 
dye removal with microbial de -colorization 
process and several parameters related to the 
mechanism.  Physico -chemical characteristics of textile 
raw wastewater and its impact towards 
degradation  
 
Different azo dyes, salts and metals, alon g 
with other compounds that make textile raw 
wastewater very difficult to decolorize from  
wastewater containing simple dye mixtures 
and sodium chloride (Saratale et al.,  2009; 
Alinsafi et al.,  2006 ). Polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA), carboxymethyl cellulose, surfac tants, 
organic processing acids, sulfide, 
formaldehyde, detergents, and oil and 
dispersants that are used in textile industry 
either to give strength to the fiber or to 
improve the adsorption of dyes on the fiber 
(Rosli and Habibah, 2006 ) which are not 
readily biodegradable and can be toxic to the 
microbial cultures. Some characteristics of 
raw textile wastewater that are important from 
the viewpoint of de -colorization are discussed 
in detail here.  
 
Dyes with methyl, methoxy, nitro or sulpho 
groups are foun d to be degraded very difficult 
as compared with dyes which have hydroxyl 
or amino groups (Nigam et al.,  1996 ). On the 
other hand, direct dyes are easily degraded 
comparing with acid and reactive dyes 
(Saratale et al.,  2009 ) whereas high molecular 
weight d yes are degraded slowly than low 
molecular weight dyes. Thus the composition 
of the azo dyes has a great influence over the 
de-colorization of dyes. The effluents are 
found toxic, xenobiotic and carcinogenic to 
aquatic life where dyes are released in the 
textile wastewater (Tüfekci et al.,  2007; 
Adinew, 2012 ). In order to improve the 
fixation of dyes on fabrics NaNO 3, NaCl and 
Na2SO 4 salts are generally added to the baths 
for improving the fixation of dyes. High 
concentrations of salts can reduce the rate o f 
biodegradation of dyes as salts can cause 
plasmolysis and reduce biological activity 
(Manu and Chaudhari, 2003 ). Electrophilic 
agents such as nitrate and sulfate compete Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2019) 8(2): 3407 -3415  
3409  
 with the dye molecule for electrons from 
azoreductases, causing negative effect on t he 
de-colorization of dyes (Meng et al.,  2012 ). 
Metal complex dyes or chemicals existing 
metals are also used in the dyeing process. It 
was reported in an article that about 30% 
metal complex dyes are used in dyeing wool 
and 40 % for dyeing polyamide (Hung er, 
2003 ). Various metals such as Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, 
Hg, Ni, Mg, Fe and Mn are found in the raw 
textile effluents which are found to inhibit 
microbial growth and enzymatic activities 
(Saranraj et al.,  2010 ). In addition, 
temperature is a great factor for de -
colorization . The temperature of the dye 
effluent can be as high as 70 ̊C which inhibits 
the microbial activities (Saratale et al.,  2009; 
Abu-Ghunmi and Jamrah, 2006 ). The 
favorable condition for dye degrading of 
microbes is 30-40 ̊C. But some bacterium 
Anoxybacillus rupiensis was identified that 
can de -colorize at about 60 ̊C. In general high 
temperature reduces the rate of de -colorization 
and hence a pretreatment of cooling is 
necessary for wastewater treatment through 
biological process. Another important  driver 
of textile wastewater treatment is fluctuating 
pH that can vary on the  particular dye process. 
It may be highly alkaline, neutral or acidic 
depending on the nature of the salts and dyes 
(Imran et al.,  2014 ). It has been recorded that 
the pH of the dye-containing wastewater can 
change the rate of degradation of the dyes 
(Hussain et al.,  2013 ). Hence either the pH of 
the wastewater should be adjusted according 
to the microbial culture or else requires the use 
of microbial strains that are capable of d e-
colorization.  On the other hand, Biological 
oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) are also important factors for 
biodegradation process. BOD refers to the 
amount of  oxygen that would be consumed if 
all the organics are  oxidized by the biol ogical 
process (ReVelle and ReVelle, 1988 ) while 
the COD is the amount of oxygen consumed 
for oxidizing organic and inorganic contaminants chemically. BOD (800mg L -1) 
and COD (2,300 mg L -1) values are observed 
in the textile wastewater (Jang et al.,  2007 ) 
whereas in another research it was recorded as 
COD values in the range of 1,067 –2,430 and 
BOD values in the range 163 –645 mg L -1 
(Yusuff and Sonibare, 2004 ). Generally, easily 
decomposed organic compounds by microbes 
can enhance the rate of dye removal fro m 
wastewater by serving as source of reducing 
equivalent (NADH, NADPH) which are 
needed for the azo  reductases to reduce azo 
bonds; but textile wastewater contains 
organics (oil, waxes, PVA and formaldehyde) 
which are not easily decomposed by microbes 
and thus their presence in wastewater can 
suppress microbial activities (Imran et al.,  
2014 ).  
 
Preference of biological treatment relative 
to physicochemical methods  
 
Several physical/chemical methods, such as 
adsorption, chemical precipitation, photolysis, 
chemical oxidation and reduction, 
electrochemical treatment, have been used for 
the removal of dyes from wastewater (Saratale 
et al.,  2011 ) depicted in the Fig. 1.  
 
Coagulation –flocculation based physical 
methods of dyes are effective for the removal 
of ma inly sulphur and disperse dyes, but 
exhibit very low efficiency for acid, direct, 
reactive and vat dyes (Saratale et al.,  2011 ). 
Moreover, huge amount of sludge and lower 
color removal efficiency limit the application 
of these techniques (Vandevivere et al., 1998 ). 
In chemical oxidation methods, various 
oxidizing agents such as ozone (O 3), hydrogen 
peroxide (H 2O2) and permanganate (MnO 4) 
are used which modify the chemical 
composition of compound  dye molecules that 
make susceptible to degradation (Metcalf, 
2003). Ozonation, advanced oxidation process 
(AOP), fenton reaction are widely use d for the 
removal of dye color.  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2019) 8(2): 3407 -3415

Physical and chemical methods have several 
drawbacks for the removal of dye color 
whereas biological methods have following 
advantages: (1) eco -friendly, (2) economical, 
(3) generating less sludge, (4) non -toxic end 
produc ts or have complete mineralization; and 
(5) requiring less water consumption 
compared to physicochemical methods (Banat 
et al.,  1996; Rai et al.,  2005 ).  
 
Mechanism for color removal  
 
There are two mechanisms for the 
decoloration of azo dyes in bacterial s ystems 
(Pearce et al.,  2003 ): 
 
―Direct electron transfer to azo dyes as 
terminal electron acceptors via enzymes 
during bacterial catabolism, connected to 
ATP -generation (energy conservation)‖.  
 
―A gratuitous reduction of azo dyes by the 
end products of bac terial catabolism, not 
linked to ATP -generation‖.  Drivers for color removal  
 
There are several factors for dye removal such 
as temperature, aeration, pH, dye structure, 
electron donor, redox potential and redox 
mediator (Pearce et al.,  2003 ).  
 
The optimum  temperature for bacterial cell 
growth is about 35-45 ̊C whereas some 
microbes can grow at 60 ̊C (Pearce et al.,  
2003 ). The loss of cell viability or 
denaturation of the azoreductase enzyme are 
occurred at higher temperature (Chang et al.,  
2001 ).  
 
Both ae robic and anaerobic conditions have 
great role on dye removal. The concentration 
of oxygen can be high by the presence of 
aeration and agitation which should be 
controlled for efficient dye removal (Chang 
and Lin, 2000 ).  
 
Oxygen has a vital role for the c ell growth of 
bacteria but oxygen with high redox potential Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2019) 8(2): 3407 -3415  
3412  
 electron acceptor can inhibit the dye reduction 
process (Pearce et al.,  2003 ).  
 
Neutral pH and slightly alkaline pH are the 
optimum conditions for efficient dye removal 
that is between 6.0 and 10  (Guo et al.,  2007 ). 
The rate of color removal decreases at 
strongly acidic or strongly alkaline pH.  
 
The greater the concentration of dyes, the 
lower the removal efficiency because of the 
formation of toxic metabolites. Aromatic 
rings with sulfonic acid g roups of reactive azo 
dyes impedes the growth of microorganisms 
at high dye concentration (Kalyani et al.,  
2008 ). Hydroxyl or amino group containing 
azo compounds can be easily degraded than 
those with a methyl, methoxy, sulpho or nitro 
groups (Nigam et al., 1996 ).  
 
Moreover, the presence of electron donors, 
the more positive redox potential and the 
presence of redox mediator has a positive 
impact on dye removal process.  
 
The residual color of dye effluent has not only 
aesthetic problem but also environme ntal 
pollution factor that should be taken care by 
the industry to make a sustainable practice.  
 
Among different processes, microbial and 
enzymatic de -colorization and degradation 
have great advantages such as low cost and 
environmentally friendly over ot her 
conventional processes. The reviewed 
literature suggests a wide variety of microbes 
are suitable for de -colorization of dyes that 
should be considered for real life application.  
 
At the time of de -colorization process some 
toxic elements such as aroma tic amines and 
other residues may be formed which should 
be required further mineralization process. It 
is also necessary to study the genetic basis of 
bacteria tolerance for salts, toxic elements and 
heavy metals.  References
