Abstract
Disulfide bond formation is a catalyzed process in vivo. In prokaryotes, the oxidation of cysteine pairs is achieved by the transfer of
disulfides from the highly oxidizing DsbA/DsbB catalytic machinery to substrate proteins. The oxidizing power utilized by this system comesfrom the membrane-embedded electron transport system, which utilizes molecular oxygen as a final oxidant. Proofreading of disulfide bond
formation is performed by the DsbC/DsbD system, which has the ability to rearrange non-native disulfides to their native configuration.
These disulfide isomerization reactions are sustained by a constant supply of reducing power provided by the cytoplasmic thioredoxinsystem, utilizing NADPH as the ultimate electron source.

1. Introduction
Disulfide bond formation is crucial for the folding and
stability of many secreted proteins. Failure to form properdisulfide bonds, or their slow formation in the cell, islikely to lead to protein aggregation and degradation byproteases. For example, alkaline phosphatase is a periplas-mic protein that contains two disulfide bonds necessary forcorrect folding. If these disulfide bonds are not formed,
the protein is almost completely degraded in vivo [1]. The
role of disulfides in the in vitro folding of proteins hasbeen studied in great detail for a number of eukaryoticmodel proteins, including ribonuclease A (RNaseA) andbovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) [2]. Disulfides
typically function to stabilize the tertiary structure of aprotein. A protein whose cysteines are linked via disulfidebonds can take on many fewer conformations than a
protein whose cysteines remain free. The decrease in chainentropy that accompanies disulfide bond formation is one
of the key factors that help disulfide bonds disfavor the
unfolded form of the protein.
Disulfide bonds can be formed spontaneously by mo-
lecular oxygen. For instance, under aerobic conditions, athin layer of cystine is generated at the air–liquid interfacewhen a cysteine solution is left exposed to air. However,this type of spontaneous, random air-oxidation reaction isvery slow and cannot account for the rapid rates of
disulfide bond formation needed by the cell. This discrep-
ancy led Anfinsen to the discovery of the first catalyst fordisulfide bond formation, the eukaryotic protein disulfideisomerase (PDI). PDI, together with Ero1, is part of thecomplex machinery responsible for the formation of di-sulfide bonds in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum.The formation of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmicreticulum has been reviewed elsewhere and will not be
discussed here [3]. Instead, this review will focus on the
bacterial catalysts for disulfide bond formation and isom-erization, using Escherichia coli as the model organism. In
E. coli , disulfide bonds are introduced in the periplasm by
the Dsb proteins (‘‘Dsb’’ stands for disulfide bond forma-
tion). The Dsb proteins include DsbA and DsbB, whichare involved in disulfide bond formation, and DsbC and

DsbD, which are involved in disulfide bond isomerization
(Fig. 1) . Since the discovery of DsbA in 1991 [1],
disulfide bond formation and isomerization in the E. coli
periplasm has become one of the best characterizedexperimental systems.
2. Oxidation of cysteine residues in the bacterial
periplasm
2.1. DsbA catalyzes disulfide bond formation
DsbA, a 21-kDa soluble protein, is the immediate donor
of disulfide bonds to proteins secreted into the E. coli
periplasm [1]. In the absence of DsbA, periplasmic protein
thiols accumulate in the reduced form. In E. coli , at least
300 proteins containing two or more cysteines are predictedto be secreted to the periplasm [4]. These proteins are
therefore potential DsbA substrates. Thus, it is not surpris-
ing that dsbA
/C0strains exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes [1].
For instance, dsbA/C0strains are hypersensitive to benzylpe-
nicillin, dithiothreitol and metals [5,6] . They show reduced
levels of several secreted proteins such as the outer-mem-brane protein OmpA and alkaline phosphatase [1]. They
also show impaired folding of h-lactamase and the flagellar
protein FlgI [1,7] .
Like many other thiol-disulfide oxido-reductases, DsbA
has a thioredoxin-like fold and a CXXC active site motif,consisting of Cys30 and Cys33. DsbA’s active site cyste-ine residues are found oxidized in vivo, which agrees withthe oxidase function of DsbA [8]. The protein acts as bothan oxidant and a disulfide bond isomerase in vitro,
depending on the redox state of the two cysteines in the
protein; however, it is much more effective as an oxidase
[9,10] .
In general, disulfide bonds stabilize proteins. However,
oxidized DsbA is less stable than reduced DsbA [11]. This
instability of both the oxidized protein and a mixeddisulfide with a target protein, which is probably anobligatory intermediate in thiol-disulfide exchange reac-tions, provides a thermodynamic driving force for the
transfer of the disulfide bond from DsbA to a target
protein (Fig. 1) . The first step of this transfer reaction is
the formation of an unstable mixed disulfide betweenDsbA and a target protein. Then, the mixed disulfide isattacked by another thiol group in the target protein. Thisresults in the formation of a disulfide bond in the targetprotein and the reduction of Cys30 and Cys33 in DsbA.
Oxidized DsbA containing the Cys30–Cys33 disulfide
bond is a potent oxidant, which is indicated by its high
redox potential, /C0120 mV [11]. In comparison, thiore-
doxin, which functions as a cytoplasmic dithiol reductant,has a much more reducing redox potential ( /C0270 mV). In
fact, DsbA is the second most oxidizing protein known(see below). The low p K
avalue of Cys30 of DsbA, the
first cysteine of the CXXC motif, is critical for determin-ing the extreme oxidizing power of DsbA [12]. Cys30 has
apK
aoff3, which contrasts sharply with the normal
pKaof cysteine residues ( f9). Thus, Cys30 is almost
entirely in the thiolate anion state at physiological pH.Several studies have shown that this thiolate anion isstabilized by hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and helixFig. 1. The oxidation and isomerization pathways in the E. coli periplasm. (A) Disulfide bonds are introduced into newly secreted polypeptides by DsbA. DsbA
is reoxidized by the inner membrane protein DsbB. In aerobic conditions, DsbB passes electrons to ubiquinone. Then electrons flow to molecular oxyge n via
the electron transport chain. (B) DsbA can form a non-native disulfide in proteins with more than two cysteine residues. The non-native disulfide is c orrected
by DsbC via disulfide shuffling. DsbC is kept reduced by the inner-membrane protein DsbD. DsbD receives electrons from the cytoplasmic thioredoxin s ystem.
Within DsbD, electrons flow from the hdomain to the gandadomains successively.H. Nakamoto, J.C.A. Bardwell / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1694 (2004) 111–119 112dipole interactions, the most important being an electro-
static interaction between His32 and Cys30 [13,14] . Sta-
bilization of the thiolate anion is a key characteristic of
DsbA, as it drives the reaction towards the reduction of
DsbA and the transfer of a disulfide bond to a targetprotein. However, DsbC has a redox potential nearly ashigh as that of DsbA and yet it is not as potent an oxidantin vitro as DsbA [15]. Despite the thermodynamic simi-
larities with DsbA as a reactant/product in its oxidoreduc-tion reaction, DsbC is much more active than DsbA incatalyzing protein disulfide rearrangements. These facts
indicate that a DsbA reaction proceeds differently from a
DsbC reaction. As described below, DsbA and DsbC aredistinguished in their tertiary and quaternary structureswhich are potentially involved in binding a target protein.The stability of a DsbA or DsbC–target protein complexmay be one of the factors which influence the reactionpathway.
The crystal structure of DsbA has been solved, both in
the oxidized and reduced states [13,16] . It shows that a
75-residue helical domain is embedded into the thiore-doxin domain of DsbA. This domain covers the CXXCactive site and contains several residues that form ahydrophobic patch. This patch, together with a grooverunning in the thioredoxin domain below the active site, islikely to interact in a hydrophobic manner with unfoldedprotein substrates [17]. Such noncovalent interactions have
indeed been reported to take place [18,19] .I ti sn o t
surprising that DsbA is able to bind proteins in a hydro-phobic manner, as DsbA must interact with proteins whilethey are still unfolded or only partially folded in order togain access to cysteine residues before they are buriedupon folding. It is therefore reasonable to assume thatDsbA specifically interacts noncovalently with unfoldedsubstrate proteins during or immediately after their trans-
location into the periplasm. The association of DsbA with
a target protein could also prevent the target protein fromfolding prior to disulfide bond formation, as once theprotein is folded it would be very difficult for DsbA togain access to the reduced cysteines. This associationbetween DsbA and the target protein should be terminatedimmediately after intermolecular disulfide exchange, sothat protein folding is not inhibited.
2.2. Reoxidation of DsbA by DsbB
In order to function as a catalyst in the periplasm, DsbA
needs to be reoxidized. Genetic as well as biochemicalevidence showed that the reoxidation of DsbA is ensuredby the inner-membrane protein DsbB (Fig. 1) [5,20] . The
fact that dsbB
/C0mutants accumulate DsbA in a reduced
state and have similar defects in disulfide bond formation as
dsbA/C0strains suggested that both DsbA and DsbB lie on
the same major oxidation pathway [20]. Moreover, the
isolation of a mixed disulfide between DsbA and DsbB[21,22] indicated that DsbA and DsbB interact directly. Thiswas confirmed in vitro when we showed that purified DsbB
is able to catalytically oxidize DsbA in the presence ofmolecular oxygen [23].
DsbB is a 20-kDa protein predicted to have four
transmembrane helices and two periplasmic loops [24].
Each periplasmic loop contains a pair of conserved cys-teines; Cys41 and Cys44 in the N-terminal loop, andCys104 and Cys130 in the C-terminal loop (Fig. 2) . These
cysteines can undergo oxidation–reduction cycles and areessential for the activity of DsbB. Removal of any one ofthese four cysteine residues causes the loss of DsbB’s
activity [22,24,25] . Like DsbA, DsbB contains a pair of
cysteine residues (Cys41–Cys44) in a CXXC motif. Un-like DsbA, however, the region surrounding Cys41–Cys44of DsbB is predicted to be too short to contain a thio-redoxin-like fold.
2.3. Reoxidation of DsbB
The fact that heme- or quinone-depleted cells accu-
mulate reduced DsbA and DsbB suggested that theoxidizing power for protein disulfide bond formation inE. coli is provided by the respiratory chain [26].W e
confirmed this hypothesis by reconstituting the completedisulfide bond formation system in vitro [23,27] . Using
purified components, we showed that quinones could actas direct recipients of electrons from DsbB. Thus, DsbB
has the novel ability to generate a disulfide in DsbA by
reducing quinones. This quinone reductase activity is theprimary source of disulfides in E. coli . Reduced quinones
are then reoxidized by the terminal oxidases cytochromebdand bo, which finally transfer electrons to oxygen
(Fig. 1) . Under anaerobic conditions, DsbB switches to
utilizing menaquinone as its immediate electron acceptor.These results show that disulfide bond formation is
Fig. 2. Membrane topology of DsbB. DsbB is predicted to contain four
transmembrane stretches and two periplasmic loops, each of which containsa pair of cysteines.H. Nakamoto, J.C.A. Bardwell / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1694 (2004) 111–119 113driven by the electron transport system and explain how
disulfides can be formed under both aerobic and anaer-obic conditions.
2.4. A model for the mechanism of action of DsbB
On the basis of in vivo results, Kishigami and Ito [25]
proposed a model for the mechanism of action of DsbB.According to this model, the solvent-exposed thiolateanion of Cys30 of DsbA attacks the Cys104/Cys130disulfide bond of DsbB and a mixed disulfide complex
is formed. This mixed disulfide is then attacked by Cys33
of DsbA, which results in the transfer of the disulfidebond from DsbB to DsbA and the reduction of Cys104and Cys130. This was suggested by the detection of amixed disulfide between Cys104 of DsbB and Cys30 of aDsbA mutant lacking Cys33 [21,22,25] .T h er e d u c e d
Cys104 and Cys130 residues are then reoxidized intramo-lecularly by the Cys41–Cys44 disulfide bond. Finally,
cysteine residues Cys41 and Cys44 are reoxidized by
quinone reduction.
Results obtained by us and others do not entirely agree
with this model [28–30] . However, Grauschopf et al. [31]
recently reported strong evidence in favor of this mecha-nism. They showed that Cys104–Cys130 can directlytransfer a disulfide bond to DsbA and is then reoxidizedby the Cys41–Cys44 disulfide bond. They also deter-
mined the redox potential of Cys41–Cys44 and Cys104–
Cys130 disulfide bonds of DsbB to be /C069 and /C0186
mV , respectively. It should be noted that these redoxpotentials were measured in the absence of bound qui-none. This makes the Cys41–Cys44 disulfide in DsbB themost oxidizing disulfide bond described in a protein todate. The Cys104–Cys130 disulfide, with a redox poten-tial of /C0186 mV, is less oxidizing than DsbA, which
would appear to make it not suitable to be the direct
reoxidant of DsbA. However, the very strongly oxidizingpotential of the Cys41–Cys44 disulfide drives the overallreaction to completion.
2.5. The novel quinone reductase activity of DsbB
DsbB is a unique enzyme that has the novel ability to use
the oxidizing power of quinones to generate disulfides de
novo [32]. The interaction of DsbB with quinones has been
partially characterized. We previously showed that DsbBhas at least one quinone-binding site, and that DsbB has aK
mof 2AM for ubiquinone [32]. DsbB mutants in the
residue Arg48 in the first periplasmic loop show a major invivo defect in their ability to catalyze disulfide formation[33]. Purified DsbB R48H exhibits an apparent K
mfor
ubiquinone seven times greater than that of the wild type
DsbB [33]. These results suggest that Arg48 plays an
important role in quinone binding. Xie et al. [34] showed
that a photoactivatable ubiquinone analog can cross-link to aregion of the second periplasmic loop of DsbB spanningresidues 91 to 97. This suggests that this region might also
be involved in the interaction of DsbB with quinones.Finally, we showed that the Cys41–Cys44 pair in DsbB is
oxidized directly by ubiquinone [29].
We recently reported that purified DsbB has a dramatic
purple color [35]. Our evidence suggests that this is due to
the presence of a bound quinhydrone, a charge-transfercomplex consisting of a hydroquinone and a quinone in astacked conformation. We propose that the quinone reduc-tase activity of DsbB involves two quinone molecules thatcan be trapped on DsbB as a quinhydrone. One of these
quinones is bound tightly to DsbB whereas the other one is
exchangeable. The resident quinone would be directlyinvolved in disulfide bond formation and would undergooxidation–reduction cycles: it would be reduced during thegeneration of a disulfide bond and then reoxidized by anexchangeable quinone derived from the oxidized quinonespool. It is during this quinone to quinone reoxidation that aquinhydrone-like complex is likely to form. Inaba et al. [64]
have also very recently observed that DsbB has a strong
reddish color, but they attribute this to a single quinonebound to DsbB in an unusual electronic state, not to aquinhydrone.
3. Disulfide reshuffling
3.1. The two periplasmic protein disulfide isomerases:
DsbC and DsbG
In any protein with more than two cysteines, there is
the potential for incorrect disulfide bond formation. Forexample, a protein with four pairs of cysteines has lessthan a 1% chance of attaining the correct four disulfidesby random oxidation. For a protein to fold correctly, any
incorrect disulfides that have been formed will need to be
broken and reformed correctly. DsbA is a very strongoxidant and oxidizes thiol compounds nonspecifically andextremely rapidly. Thus, it has the potential of introducingnon-native disulfides into proteins with multiple cysteines[36]. If disulfide bonds are formed immediately following
translocation to the periplasm, incorrect disulfides will beformed unless each pair of cysteines that is destined to
form a native disulfide bond is located consecutively in
the primary structure of the protein. Incorrect disulfidebonds formed by DsbA may trap proteins in nonnativeconformations. In vivo, DsbA is present in the oxidizedstate [8]and has a very low ability to reduce incorrect
disulfides. Thus, it cannot provide proofreading activityfor improperly formed disulfides. Incorrect disulfides willneed to be reshuffled and corrected before the protein can
attain its proper conformation.
Disulfide reshuffling involves an intramolecular thiol/
disulfide exchange reaction; i.e., the nucleophilic attack ofan incorrect disulfide bond by a thiolate anion. In theperiplasm, this reaction is catalyzed by the disulfide bondH. Nakamoto, J.C.A. Bardwell / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1694 (2004) 111–119 114isomerase DsbC [36,37] . There is another periplasmic
homolog to DsbC, that is, DsbG [38]. Its cellular function
is not yet known. It may function as a disulfide bond
isomerase since overproduction of DsbG could restore the
ability of dsbC mutants to express multidisulfide-containing
BPTI [38]. However, unlike DsbC, DsbG could neither
catalyze insulin reduction in vitro or oxidative proteinrefolding of RNase efficiently, indicating functional differ-ences between DsbC and DsbG.
DsbC and DsbG are both homodimeric proteins
(2/C2f25 kDa) with a CXXC active site motif [15,37,38] .
They share 30% sequence identity and 49% sequence simi-
larity. DsbG is expressed at approximately 25% the level ofDsbC. In contrast to DsbA, the two active-site cysteineresidues of DsbC and DsbG are kept reduced in the periplasm[38,39] . This allows the N-terminal thiolate group of the
CXXC motif of DsbC or DsbG to attack the incorrectdisulfide bond of a target protein, forming a mixed disulfidebond between them. The mixed disulfide bond is then
attacked by a thiolate group in the target protein, resulting
in a new disulfide bond in the target protein and reformationof a thiolate group in the catalyst (Fig. 3) . Alternatively, the
disulfide isomerase could simply remove the incorrect disul-fide, becoming oxidized in the process.
3.2. DsbC is a V-shaped dimer
McCarthy et al. [4]reported the 1.9-A ˚resolution crystal
structure of DsbC. DsbC forms an overall V-shaped struc-ture where each arm of the V is a DsbC monomer consistingof two separate domains, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal domains fromeach monomer join to form the dimer interface at the base of
the V. The C-terminal catalytic domain has a thioredoxin-like fold. The sulfur of the first cysteine of the active site
CXXC motif (Cys98) is partially solvent exposed, consis-
tent with its expected function of forming a mixed disulfidebond with a substrate protein. A second disulfide bond ispresent in DsbC, between Cys141 and Cys163. This disul-fide is also partially solvent exposed, but is thought to play amore structural role. This structural disulfide bond is not ashighly conserved among DsbCs from different bacterialspecies as the catalytic disulfide bond. E. coli DsbG lacks
the second disulfide bond.
3.3. DsbC and DsbG have chaperone-like activity
As native disulfide bonds are generally buried in the
structure of folded proteins [40] and often in hydrophobic
environments, the reduction of such a disulfide bond must bepreceded by a local or global unfolding step that exposes the
bond to a reductant. Non-native disulfides could be buried or
exposed. The ability of DsbC and DsbG to isomerize disul-fide bonds suggests that they might interact with hydrophobicregions of folding, but not with fully folded polypeptides.These properties are reminiscent of those of molecularchaperones. Not surprisingly, DsbC and DsbG appear topossess peptide-binding and molecular chaperone activities,in that they assist the in vitro refolding of model substrates
such as lysozyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase, citrate synthase and luciferase [41,42] . The chaperone
activity of DsbG is independent of its redox state [42].
Unlike DsbA, DsbC does not have a helical domain that is
large enough to form a cap over the active CXXC site, and the
Fig. 3. The isomerization of a wrongly formed disulfide by DsbC. Reduced DsbC attacks an incorrect disulfide bond of a substrate protein and an
intermolecular disulfide is formed. Then, the intermolecular disulfide is exchanged for the correct intramolecular disulfide in the substrate pro tein, releasing
DsbC in a reduced state (A). Alternatively, the intermolecular disulfide between the substrate protein and DsbC is exchanged for an intramolecular d isulfide
within DsbC, releasing the substrate protein in a reduced state and DsbC in an oxidized state (B). This is then followed by an oxidation reaction of the s ubstrate
protein catalyzed by DsbA and a reduction of DsbC by DsbD (not shown).H. Nakamoto, J.C.A. Bardwell / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1694 (2004) 111–119 115hydrophobic cleft proposed to bind a substrate peptide to
DsbA is not present in DsbC. Instead, the inside of the V-likestructure of dimeric DsbC is covered with uncharged resi-
dues, forming a large central cleft [4]. The active sites of the
N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain from each DsbC mono-mer face inwards across the cleft. Substrate peptides maybind noncovalently to the cleft, allowing the reduced activesite Cys98 thiol to attack a substrate disulfide bond forming acovalently bound mixed DsbC–substrate intermediate. Amixed disulfide bond between DsbC and a model peptidecomposed of residue 4–31 of BPTI is 40- to 100-fold more
stable than the corresponding complex between the model
peptide and DsbA [43]. The higher stability of a mixed
disulfide complex between peptide and DsbC is likely toresult from enhanced peptide binding by DsbC’s larger cleft,which may allow the peptide to search various conformationsfor the correct disulfide bond to form. Burial of hydrophobicresidues upon protein folding that accompanies correct di-sulfide bond formation may destabilize the DsbC–substrate
protein complex, allowing the correctly folded protein to
dissociate from DsbC.
3.4. Dimerization of DsbC is important for isomerase and
chaperone activity
The dimeric nature of DsbC is essential for its isomerase
function and the thioredoxin domain alone is inactive as an
isomerase [44]. Monomeric DsbC also lacks molecular
chaperone activity in vitro [44]. These results could indicate
that the broad hydrophobic cleft plays an essential role inthe association of DsbC with a target protein and itsdisulfide reshuffling/protein folding activities. It could alsobe that the presence of two active sites in the DsbC dimerenhances its activity. Evidence in favor of the latter hypoth-esis came from experiments performed with heterodimers of
DsbC where one of the two active sites is inactivated by
carboxymethylation [44]. The structural and functional
properties of DsbC are reminiscent of those of eukaryoticPDI[45]. PDI is thought to have two roles, the oxidation of
disulfides and the isomerization of incorrect disulfides [46].
PDI, a resident of the endoplasmic reticulum, is composedof five separate domains [47]. Four of these domains (except
c), a, b, b V, and a V, all belong to the thioredoxin family.
These individual domains lack the full isomerase activity
exhibited by the complete PDI molecule [48].
3.5. Reduction of DsbC and DsbG by DsbD
DsbC and DsbG have to be kept reduced in the periplasm
in order to stay active as isomerases. The reduction of DsbCand DsbG is carried out by the inner-membrane protein
DsbD [38,49] . DsbD in turn is kept reduced by the cyto-
plasmic protein thioredoxin (Fig. 1) [36,39] .
DsbD is a 59-kDa protein which consists of three
domains: an N-terminal periplasmic domain ( a), a central
domain with eight transmembrane segments ( h) and a C-terminal periplasmic domain ( g). Each domain of DsbD
possesses a conserved pair of cysteine residues, which hasbeen shown by site-directed mutagenesis experiments to be
required for its disulfide transport activity [50,51] .
3.6. A model for the transfer of disulfide bonds across the
membrane
Determining the mechanism of action of DsbD is of
interest because DsbD and its homologues are the onlyproteins capable of transporting disulfide bonds across the
membrane. It has been postulated that electron flow within
DsbD occurs via a succession of disulfide exchange reac-tions, where disulfides are transferred from DsbC to the a
domain, then on to the gdomain, and finally on to the h
domain (Fig. 1) . The hdomain is then reduced by thio-
redoxin and thioredoxin reductase in an NADPH-dependentreaction [52].
Most of the steps that have been proposed by this model
are well characterized. The identification of a mixed-disul-
fide between thioredoxin and the hdomain argues in favor
of a direct interaction between thioredoxin and the hdomain
[52]. The periplasmic steps of the DsbD reaction are even
more characterized. Using purified gandadomains, we
showed in vitro that electrons flow from the gdomain to the
adomain and then to DsbC or DsbG [53]. We determined
the redox potential of the gandadomains to be /C0241 and
/C0229 mV, respectively, which indicates that the electron
flow is thermodynamically driven. In vitro, we showed thattheadomain can efficiently reduce DsbC and DsbG with a
K
mof 5AM. The structure of the gandadomains have
been determined [54,55] . The gdomain has a thioredoxin-
like fold whereas the adomain is a part of the immuno-
globulin superfamily. The structure of a complex betweentheadomain and DsbC has also been solved [56]. The a
domain binds the central cleft of the V-shaped DsbC dimer.
This enables the complex to adopt a closed conformation,allowing exclusive interactions between the two DsbCcatalytic domains and the adomain.
3.7. The bdomain: DsbD’s black box
The membranous part of the DsbD reaction is still obscure.
It is clear that the hdomain is required to transfer electrons
from thioredoxin to the gdomain as removal of the hdomain
leads to the accumulation of oxidized gandadomains. We
also purified the hdomain and showed that it can transfer
electrons from thioredoxin to the gdomain in vitro [53].
However, how electrons are transferred from the h
domain to the gdomain is still unclear. Is it by pure
disulfide exchange? Is a cofactor, for instance quinone,
required like in DsbB ? So far, there is no evidence that
the cysteine residues of the hdomain interact directly with
the cysteine residues of the gdomain and attempts to isolate
mixed disulfides between the two domains were unsuccess-ful. Moreover, both cysteine residues of the hdomain seemH. Nakamoto, J.C.A. Bardwell / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1694 (2004) 111–119 116to be on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane [57]. If such
is the case, how can they reduce the cysteines of the g
domain, which are in the periplasm? The important question
of how electrons are transferred across the membrane is still
unanswered and further work is required.
3.8. The oxidation and isomerization systems are kept
separated in the periplasm
As we described above, the formation of correct disulfide
bonds in a target protein involves two different pathways:
(1) disulfide bond formation by DsbA and the reoxidation of
DsbA by DsbB and the respiratory system, and (2) disulfidereshuffling or isomerization by DsbC and re-reduction ofDsbC by DsbD and the cytosolic thioredoxin system. DsbAis found almost entirely in the oxidized state in vivo, whileDsbC is entirely reduced [58]. This indicates that cross-talk
between these two systems is avoided in the E. coli
periplasm.
Why does DsbA or DsbB not oxidize DsbC or DsbD and
why does DsbC or DsbD not reduce DsbA or DsbB? DsbAand DsbB have more oxidizing redox potentials than eitherDsbC or DsbD. Thus, the cross-talk should be thermody-namically driven. Compounding this problem is the obser-vation that DsbB seems to be rather promiscuous inrecognizing the thioredoxin folds of different proteins suchas DsbA, monomeric DsbC, thioredoxin and PDI.
Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that DsbD
cannot reduce DsbA. The adomain transfers electrons to
DsbC, but not to DsbA in vitro [53]. Biochemical evidence
suggests that DsbA and DsbB are unable to oxidize DsbC invivo. DsbA oxidizes DsbC very slowly in vitro, slowenough to essentially eliminate any cross-talk in vivo [15].
DsbB reoxidizes the thioredoxin fold of dimeric DsbC atleast 500-fold more slowly than does DsbA [32]. Bader et
al.[59] concluded that the two pathways are also partitioned
by the dimerization of DsbC. Various mutations in thedimerization interface of DsbC, which prevented dimerformation, allowed the DsbC monomers to become oxidizedb yD s b B ,b o t hi nv i v oa n di nv i t r o ,a n dt h e s eD s b Cmonomers can complement a dsbA null mutation. The
simplest explanation for these results is that dimerizationacts to shield DsbC from the reoxidant DsbB.
4. The practical implications of the DsbA–DsbC
pathway for protein expression
The periplasm of E. coli is a useful compartment for
the expression of proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Itis an oxidative environment containing disulfide bond
formation machinery. Just like in the folding of endoge-
nous proteins with disulfide bonds in E. coli periplasm as
described above, the Dsb proteins play essential roles inthe folding of foreign proteins [60]. Overexpression of
Dsb proteins has been employed to increase the yield andthe stability of the overexpressed recombinant proteins
with multiple disulfide bonds [61–63] . However, when
expressed in the periplasmic space of E. coli , eukaryotic
proteins often fail to form the proper disulfide linkages,
though they are oxidized to completion. This is a majorproblem in the commercial expression of pharmacologi-cally active eukaryotic proteins. Almost all E. coli proteins
contain two or fewer disulfides, and mismatches are notlikely to occur. In contrast, many heterologous proteinscontain multiple disulfides with complex disulfide bondingpatterns; expression in the E. coli periplasm often results
in ‘‘scrambled’’ proteins as the incorrect thiol groups
become linked, thus resulting in a non-native inactiveprotein. The strong oxidizing power of the disulfidecatalyst DsbA and the disulfide isomerase DsbC drivesthe extremely oxidizing nature of periplasm. These pro-teins are much more oxidizing than the eukaryotic ana-logue, PDI. It may be necessary to down-regulate theoxidizing power of these proteins, or enhance the isomer-
ization power of DsbC in order to obtain optimal expres-
sion of eukaryotic proteins in the periplasm of E. coli .
5. Concluding remarks
Disulfide bond formation in the periplasm is not the
result of a spontaneous oxidation reaction. It is a catalyzed
process in which each Dsb protein plays a distinct role.
Since the discovery of DsbA in 1991, much work has beendone and most of the important steps involved in theformation of native disulfide bonds have been unraveled.DsbA and DsbB are responsible for de novo disulfide bondformation while DsbC and DsbD rescue proteins that havenon-native disulfides. DsbA is the direct donor of disulfidebonds and is maintained in an oxidized state by the novel
quinone reductase activity of DsbB. In this way, the oxi-
dizing power of the DsbA–DsbB pathway is sustained bythe electron transport system. Proteins that contain non-native disulfides are freed from this folding trap by thedisulfide isomerase DsbC. To function properly, DsbC ismaintained in a reduced state by DsbD. DsbD taps into thereducing power of the thioredoxin system in the cytosol anddelivers reducing equivalents to DsbC.
However, some very intriguing problems remain un-
solved. We still do not know exactly how DsbB cangenerate disulfide bonds from quinone reduction, a reactionwhich appears to be the source of the vast majority ofdisulfides in E. coli . DsbD acts to transport disulfides across
the membrane; how it does so is almost entirely unclear.Further characterization of the hdomain of DsbD will help
to understand how DsbD solves this unique problem. Both
DsbB and DsbD can be purified in large amounts, so further
biochemical as well as structural progress is likely. Anotherinteresting question that remains unanswered is, what is thefunction of DsbG? If it functions as a disulfide bondisomerase, then why does E. coli have two homologousH. Nakamoto, J.C.A.
