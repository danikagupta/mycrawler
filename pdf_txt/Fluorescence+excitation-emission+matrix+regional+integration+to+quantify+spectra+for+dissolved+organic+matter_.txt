12.1 INTRODUCTION
Fluorescence is a form of luminescence, whereby light (energy) is absorbed by a substance at 
a particular wavelength (excitation), and then emitted at a longer wavelength (lower energy, 
emission). The difference between the absorption and fluorescence maxima is known as the 
Stokes shift, and the entire process typically takes place over a very short timeframe. This is 
one of the characteristics which separates it from phosphorescence, which typically takes 
place over longer timeframes. These processes are best described in general by a Jablonski 
diagram (Figure 1), named after the Polish physicist Aleksander Jabłonski (1933).doi: 10.2166/9781789062977_0265

Not all substances or compounds are capable of exhibiting fluorescence. However, since it 
was first referred to in 1852 (Stokes, 1852), fluorescence-based methods have been used 
to analytically detect and quantify specific compounds with high sensitivity. Fluorescence 
spectroscopy is often described as being 10 to 1000 times more sensitive than absorbance 
spectroscopy, due to the nature of the measurement having a ‘true’ zero. There are many 
ways which fluorescence can and has been used analytically, from single point to simple 
2D emission measurements at a single excitation wavelength, to synchronous fluorescence 
and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. Depending on the complexity of 
the sample, spectra of mixtures such as organic matter, can often be deconstructed into 
independently varying components using a variety of analytical tools (see section: 11.6 
Data Processing). This chapter will focus on fluorescence EEM spectroscopy, and its practical 
relevance in relation to membrane-based water treatment and fouling in general. 
Broadly speaking, the analysis of FDOM (fluorescent dissolved organic matter) with EEM 
spectroscopy found early use in the natural sciences, the bulk of which was first carried out 
within oceanography. The methods have also been transferred to freshwater and estuarial 
research applications, and subsequently have seen applications tied to water treatment 
within a number of different fields. Fluorescence EEM spectroscopy has now been used to 
detect and characterise organic content within the aquatic sciences, across a large variety of 
natural and engineered systems. Oceans (Catalá et al., 2015; Stedmon and Nelson, 2015),

seas, lakes (Kothawala et al., 2014; Osburn et al., 2017), and rivers (Baker and Inverarity, 
2004), as well as drinking water (Bridgeman et al., 2011), wastewater (Carstea et al., 2016), 
water recycling (Hambly et al., 2010; Hambly et al., 2015; Henderson et al., 2009; Murphy 
et al., 2011), aquaculture (Hambly et al., 2015; Spiliotopoulou et al., 2017; Yamin et al., 
2017), and desalination (Drozdova et al., 2017; Shutova et al., 2016) are some of the varied 
aquatic settings in which fluorescence has been applied, from small scale research studies to 
large scale industrial uses. 
Within the context of this chapter, fluorescence EEM spectroscopy has shown particular 
use in the analysis and understanding of membrane-based systems. As an optimised target 
compound removal is paramount to the performance of any membrane system, any sort 
of membrane fouling can therefore limit the systems performance. Feed waters often 
contain a high level of organic compounds, and as such various forms of organic fouling of 
the membranes can occur. The performance of a membrane system can be evaluated on the 
FDOM analysis of different aspects of it, and depending on which aspect it is measuring, 
the appropriate analytical method will require tweaking. Specific details of fluorescence 
methods are thus contained in the following sections.
Numerous other aspects of the measurement also need to be addressed before fluorescence 
data is ready for interpretation. While fluorescence measurements are somewhat simpler 
when compared to e.g., liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, analysts must 
consider many questions before measurements can take place. For example, how should 
samples be taken and how long can they be stored? How exactly should fluorescence be 
measured, and which analysis strategy is the best for a given study? The following sections 
11.2 to 11.7 provide guidance for the practical aspects behind fluorescence measurements 
within an aquatic context.
12.2 SAMPLING & STORAGE
Samples taken from different stages of membrane filtration consist of particulate and soluble 
material in water. A fraction of this material is highly bioavailable to microorganisms, while 
other fractions resist biodegradation for longer periods (Hu and Ren, 2019; Urgun-Demirtas 
et al., 2008). When it comes to sampling and subsequent storage prior to measurements, the 
more bioavailable material requires special attention, as microbes naturally target the most 
available compounds first and can thus alter the sample quickly (Heinz and Zak, 2018). 
In general, it is advisable to process samples and perform fluorescence measurements as 
quickly as possible to avoid storage artefacts. However, the constraints of sampling do not 
always allow for fast sample processing. In such cases, preserving the sample and knowing 
about possible storage effects is important. Preservation strategies include filtration, storage 
in cold and dark conditions, freezing, and chemical poisoning. In contrast, autoclaving 
introduces changes in FDOM (Andersson et al., 2018).
Good practices for characterizing dissolved materials include 1) removing living organisms 
as quickly as possible through filtration; 2) storing the sample at temperatures below 
10 °C in the dark to minimize biological activity; 3) measuring as quickly as possible but 
preferably at most within 5 days of sampling, and; 3) maintaining the same procedure for 
sample processing within a study to keep potential biases constant.

Experimental Methods for Membrane ApplicationsDifferent filter materials and pore sizes are available for filtration. Amongst the available 
materials, glass fiber filters are the safest option regarding contamination since they can 
be ashed (>  4  h at > 450  °C, (Coble et al., 2014)). However, glass fibre filters generally 
only exist with pore sizes of larger than 0.3  μm. The classic GF/F filter with a pore size of 
0.7  μm was used to distinguish particulate from dissolved matter. However, at that pore 
size, studies have reported bacterial passage rates between 10 and 25 % in marine samples 
(Morán et al., 1999). It should however be noted that passage of microbes through filters 
with all common diameters can be observed (Obayashi and Suzuki, 2019; Wang et al., 
2007, 2008). If initial cell counts are high and assimilable carbon is abundant, microbial 
regrowth can quickly change sample character despite the usage of ‘sterile’ filters (< 0.2 μm). 
These observations emphasize that storages times should be kept short and effects of 
microbial passage will depend on the original sample. Lastly, the leaching of filter material 
into the sample should be investigated for the specific batch of filters used in each study. 
In the context of wastewater, such leaching is likely negligible but can affect primarily the 
UVA fluorescence emission range due to the leaching of production-related impurities. 
Filters should be rinsed with ultrapure water followed by sample prior to obtaining a filtrate 
for analysis. Filtration should occur slowly to avoid the bursting of cells (Rosenstock and 
Simon, 1993).
Freezing as a means to slow down biological processes can help to facilitate longer sample 
storage. While some studies recommend freezing as suitable for samples with low carbon 
concentrations, significant changes in optical indices, sample absorbance, and fluorescence 
emission characteristics have been observed (Fellman et al., 2008; Heinz and Zak, 2018; 
Spencer et al., 2007) concluded that the effects cannot be predicted from the composition of 
the original sample. Thus, the effects cannot be corrected post-measurement.
12.3 BENCHTOP INSTRUMENTATION
Since fluorescence analyses are increasingly popular, users have a range of choices concerning 
benchtop instrumentation. However, specifications regarding instrument and software 
can differ significantly between instruments and affect the measurement experience and 
resulting data quality.
Commercial instruments on the market today usually feature incandescent or pulsed Xenon 
lamps. These lamps provide excitation light in the entire ultraviolet-visible spectrum 
(approx. 220 – 800 nm) and have a relatively continuous emission spectrum. To understand 
the instrument’s limitations, it is important to keep in mind the lamp’s output spectrum. 
For example, incandescent Xe lamps provide little light at wavelengths shorter than 
240 nm and resulting emission scans are generally noisier and can be difficult to interpret. 
Xe flash lamps can provide more light in the ultraviolet range resulting in a wider usable 
excitation range and a more uniform signal-to-noise relationship across EEMs (Lakowicz, 
2006a). However, Xe flash lamps also contain more distinct emission bands, that need to 
be addressed to obtain spectrally calibrated EEMs. Lastly, incandescent Xe lamps have a 
lifetime of < 2000 h and thus require more maintenance compared to pulsed light sources.

Chapter 12  The optical configuration of spectrofluorometers can differ significantly due to the 
requirements dictated by the detection system. The classic photomultiplier tube (PMT) is a 
sensitive photon detector that lacks the ability to distinguish light of different wavelengths 
but offers superior sensitivity thanks to signal amplification and low noise levels. 
Spectrofluorometers that utilize PMTs require two monochromators: The first selects a 
narrow band of light for sample excitation, the second permits a narrow band of fluorescence 
emission to pass through to the PMT. By scanning through all desired emission wavelengths 
at all desired excitation wavelengths, an EEM is constructed with typical speeds of 500 nm/
min (total time typically between 20-40 min). On the other hand, charge-coupled device 
detectors (CCDs) allow the simultaneous detection of the entire wavelength range of 
interest and reduce measurement times considerably.
Due to the necessity to consider non-linearity in fluorescence observations due to the optical 
density of a sample (discussed below), it is also important to consider the availability of 
spectrophotometers during the measurement of fluorescence. If potential projects involve 
field measurements, the use of instruments with a combined absorbance-fluorescence 
detection system can be advantageous since all required measurements are made within one 
unit (see Figure 2).
Figure 2 An example of a modern spectrofluorometer instrumentation setup in a research 
laboratory – in this case an iteration of the Horiba Aqualog with a CCD detector.
As mentioned above, samples generally contain particulate and dissolved material. While 
both fractions contain fluorescent moieties, different instrument configurations are required 
to characterize the material. For example, dissolved fluorescent material is quantified after 
filtration of a water sample through filters in the classic right-angle geometry with a quartz 
cuvette (Figure 3, left). On the other hand, the measurement of particulate material occurs 
either directly in the unfiltered, optically thick suspension or by exciting particles directly 
on a surface. In both cases, the non-transparent nature of the particulate sample necessitates 
a front-face illumination (Figure 3, right). Front-face measurements of thick suspensions 
can also occur in cuvettes, but require adapters to either adjust the angle of the incident light 
relative to the cuvette face or to capture and direct the light at a specific angle toward the 
cuvette. The remainder of this section will discuss right-angle fluorescence of optically thin 
solutions since this is by far the most common application of fluorescence.

12.4 QUALITY ASSURANCE
Most of today’s spectrofluormeters are spectrally calibrated in full from the factory. 
However, to generate comparable results, wavelength accuracy and spectral calibration are 
especially important to monitor over time as the instrument ages. Wavelength accuracy 
refers to the deviation between true and detected wavelength in nanometres; either the 
excitation light intercepted by the cuvette or the fluorescence emission captured by the 
detector. Manufacturers commonly list the specification in the instrument manual and 
a precision of ± 1 nm is typical. Deviations are monitored by detecting the peak position 
of Rayleigh scatter at e.g., 467  nm, while the accuracy of the emission detector can be 
verified by determining the peak position of the 435.8 nm Hg band emitted by common 
low-pressure mercury vapor lamps (Sansonetti et al., 1996). Monitoring changes in peak 
positions is especially important after instrument transport.
Spectral calibration refers to the elimination of spectral biases that arise from a biased lamp 
emission spectrum, and wavelength-dependent monochromator and detector biases. Some 
of these biases are eliminated with the use of reference detectors, but the remainder of the 
bias is removed with the use of excitation and emission correction factors that come pre-
installed from the factory. It can however be a good idea to verify their appropriateness 
from time to time. A triangular cuvette of Rhodamine B produces a flat excitation spectrum 
after the successful elimination of spectral biases (Kopf and Heinze, 1984). The emission 
calibration is commonly verified with standards available from the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST). Different standards cover the ultraviolet-visible 
emission range and the recorded spectra should fall within the certified values at all times 
(Gilmore, 2014).
To obtain valid results, the measured sample needs to meet certain criteria to ensure that 
the instrument is capable of delivering the best results possible. For example, fluorescence 
counts should not exceed the linear range of the detector. Fortunately, the instrument 
control software usually warns users when the linearity threshold is exceeded. In such cases, 
settings can be adjusted (e.g., integration time) or samples diluted. 
In cases with high concentrations of chromophores, the sample transmission can be too low 
to deliver quantitative fluorescence results. Kothawala et al., (2013) defined an absorbance 
of 0.05  cm-1 (89  % transmittance) as the cutoff below which such effects can be safely

Chapter 12  neglected (Kothawala et al., 2013). On the other hand, an absorbance of 1.5   cm-1 (3  % 
transmittance) was found to be the upper limit after which no quantitative fluorescence 
results can be obtained even if correction methods are applied (see below). It is thus 
important that samples meet the second criterion during the fluorescence measurements, as 
no post-measurements for linearity will be possible.
Prior to every study, choosing appropriate measurement settings is important to ensure 
appropriate fluorescence counts in the relevant ranges of the EEM are accumulated. Regarding 
range and resolution, the types of observed fluorophores and their properties will govern 
which parts of the EEM should be captured. For example, if protein-like material, phenolic 
compounds, and / or oils are present a high resolution in the excitation range below 300 nm 
is especially important. To distinguish these highly similar fluorophores and quantify their 
fluorescence, it can also be important to capture emission spectra with a resolution below 
3  nm if bandwidth characteristics of monochromators permit this. For instruments with 
incandescent Xe lamps, it generally makes little sense to capture emission below 240 nm 
even if sample fluorophores exhibit strong absorbance bands since signal-to-noise ratios 
deteriorate in the UV region. Capturing the emission up until 800 nm is necessary should 
the sample contain algae or fluorescent pigments. Moreover, to enable the correction of 
inner filter effects, it is important to measure the samples absorbance spectrum covering all 
excitation and emission wavelengths. Otherwise, such corrections can become difficult to 
implement.
12.5 INTERFERENCES
As an extrinsic property of fluorophores in solution, fluorescence fingerprints are 
vulnerable to changes due to interferences. Such changes can impact fluorescence yields (per 
mol of substance) and spectra and are caused by physicochemical properties of the sample. 
When comparisons between samples are made, it is thus important to consider whether 
physicochemical properties remain stable or are subject to change. In the following, we will 
list some examples (not all) of the physicochemical parameters known to influence DOM 
fluorescence.
The sample’s temperature can affect the fluorescence intensity observed for a given sample. 
When solvent temperatures increase, observed fluorescence generally decreases. However, 
there is no evidence to suggest that spectral characteristics change due to temperature 
(McKay et al., 2018). This effect is of great importance for in situ measurements with 
sensors since temperature can vary systematically over longer periods of time. However, 
a compensation is trivial if the sample’s temperature is known (Watras et al., 2011). For 
benchtop instruments, temperature effects are usually not an issue since jacketed cuvette 
holders and climate-controlled laboratories eliminate the chance for systematic biases.
Changes in pH can lead to spectrally-dependent changes in a sample’s fluorescence. 
Numerous studies have investigated the effect of pH on organic matter fluorescence, and 
the different results reported in each study hints at sample-dependent, complex effects 
(e.g. Esteves et al., 1999; Groeneveld et al., 2022; Mobed et al., 1996; Murphy et al., 2018; 
Spencer et al., 2007). These complex changes make it effectively impossible to compensate

Experimental Methods for Membrane Applicationsthe pH-induced interference. It is thus best to avoid sample-to-sample differences in pH to 
facilitate comparisons between samples.
Beyond temperature and pH, ionic strength, the presence of metal ions, and particle 
attenuation have also been reported to affect fluorescence measurements. As with all 
physicochemical properties, it is advisable to obtain reference measurements for samples 
coming from the system that is subject of a study. This will help to ascertain if issues with 
certain parameters are to be expected and if so, whether great variation (e.g., pH or ionic 
strength) might introduce artefacts that complicate interpretation of the fluorescence 
readings in a given dataset.
12.6 DATA PROCESSING
Fluorescence measurements require several steps of processing before further analyses can 
take place (Figure 4). While some software offers comprehensive features that contain the 
most critical steps, we believe it is most advisable to export data from proprietary formats 
and subsequently use open software environments to process and analyze fluorescence 
data. This gives the user more control over processing steps, freedom of choice regarding 
analysis strategies, and maximizes the impact of the conducted research by extracting 
as much information as possible. Amongst the most common languages for statistical 
computing, Matlab and R have community-driven software packages (Matlab: drEEM, 
EEMlab;  R: eemR, StaRdom, albatross) that facilitate all steps in Figure 4 and enable a range 
of multivariate analyses (Micó et al., 2019; Murphy et al., 2013; Pucher et al., 2019). While 
theoretically possible, an analysis of EEMs in spreadsheet software is not recommended 
since workflows are not easily automatable.

Figure 4 Steps involved in the processing of fluorescence measurements.
After the successful import into the programming environment of choice, the next 
processing steps concerns the correction or removal of different measurement biases. For 
example, a blank should be subtracted from each sample fluorescence landscape to remove 
the impact of background signals and reduce the abundance of scatter. Such blanks should 
be measured daily and always be made from the sample solvent (e.g. water, buffered water,

organic solvent). Blanks can also function as a standard for the calibration of fluorescence 
signals into Raman Units (Lawaetz and Stedmon, 2009). Next, inner-filter effects (IFEs) are 
compensated since they disturb the linearity of observed fluorescence due to the partial or 
complete absorbance of emitted fluorescence by chromophores (Parker and Rees, 1960). 
Such effects are easily corrected by applying correction factors derived from the sample’s 
absorbance scan – provided the maximum absorbance be below approx. 1.5 cm-1 (Kothawala 
et al., 2013).
The removal of Rayleigh and Raman scatter can be an important step if the subsequent 
analysis strategy (see below) includes the decomposition of fluorescence EEMs into 
statistical components according to Beer Lambert’s law (Bahram et al., 2006). The open-
source software packages mentioned above include functions for scatter removal and thus 
simplify this task considerably.
12.7 DATA ANAL YSIS
Once data is measured and fully processed, the data analysis can occur. Analysis strategies 
(overview in Table 1) can range from simply comparing fluorescence intensities (known 
as ‘peak picking’) and fluorescence indices to multivariate analysis such as parallel factor 
analysis (PARAFAC).

The comparison of fluorescence intensities usually occurs at predefined wavelengths that 
typically have letters assigned to them (see Figure 5, table 2). For example, peak T, extracted 
at excitation / emission 275  /  340 is typically ascribed to tryptophan- or protein-like 
material. Peaks A and C on the other hand are often described as humic-like material. It 
should be noted that the interpretation of fluorescence peaks should only be informed by 
comparison with studies of the same sample material and take into account potential issues 
(e.g. pharmaceuticals fluorescing like amino acids).

Fluorescence regional integration (FRI) is a particularly popular technique in engineered 
systems by which integrals of wavelength regions in the EEM (Figure 5, yellow lines) are 
tracked across samples. The assignment of these regions is based on model compounds 
and natural environmental samples (Chen et al., 2003). According to Chen et al., (2003), 
the five regions as illustrated in Figure 5 are aromatic protein-like material (I + II), fulvic 
acid-like compounds (III), microbial by-product-like fluorescence (IV), and humic-like 
material (V). Subsequent to the publication of the FRI approach, multivariate modelling has 
indicated that underlying fluorescence spectra in regions I, II and IV, as well as III and V 
overlap spectrally and regional integrals are likely not as specific as the names above suggest 
(Stedmon et al., 2003).

Chapter 12  Several fluorescence-based indices also find frequent application (Figure 5, thick black 
lines, Table 2). For example, the humification index (HIX) informs about the ratio between 
protein- and humic-like fluorescence and thus can help to understand qualitative shifts 
between samples (Ohno, 2002). The biological index (BIX) is a ratio between ultraviolet and 
visible fluorescence and can indicate the importance of recent biological transformations 
of material (Huguet et al., 2009). Lastly, the fluorescence index (FI) distinguishes between 
microbial and terrestrial inputs in aquatic environments (Maie et al., 2006; McKnight et 
al., 2001). As with peak picking, one should be careful to extrapolate interpretations from 
studies performed on different sample types to membrane samples. The above-mentioned 
fluorescence indices were defined in studies of natural aquatic environments but can help to 
identify qualitative differences between samples.
12.7.1 PARAFAC
Amongst the multivariate analysis techniques, PARAFAC is the most popular technique 
in the analysis of DOM and this section will provide a short overview over this technique. 
For tutorials on MCR and PCA, we refer the reader to Bro and Smilde (2014), and de Juan 
et al., (2014). PARAFAC is a particularly popular model for the decomposition since it 
naturally follows the analytical principals of fluorescence (Bro, 1997; Murphy et al., 2013; 
Stedmon and Bro, 2008). Each analyte (termed ‘component’ in the model) is described as 
a product of an excitation and emission spectrum multiplied by a concentration factor. The 
entire EEM is the sum of the fluorescence arising from each of the components. PARAFAC 
is particularly attractive since it can distinguish spectrally overlapping components and thus 
allows insights into components that may not be distinguishable in the raw fluorescence 
data. Also, PARAFAC can isolate systematic signals in noisy measurements and thus help 
to improve the quality of the results. Moreover, the component spectra can be compared 
between studies and help to inform the chemical interpretation of the signals.
As a multivariate modelling approach, PARAFAC analyses work best if a number of criteria 
are met. For example, a minimum number of samples with meaningful compositional 
variability helps to identify meaningful and robust models. If two or more peaks covary 
perfectly, the approach may produce questionable models. Similarly, if a dataset consists 
of too few samples, the algorithm can struggle to identify the underlying components. 
As discussed above, the fluorescence occurring in each sample can be altered due to 
interferences.  In such cases, it is most likely more fruitful to rely on peak picking and/or the 
interpretation of fluorescence indices.
12.8 APPLICATION IN MEMBRANE SYSTEMS
As outlined above, there are myriad ways in which fluorescence measurements can be 
applied to aquatic systems that utilise some form of membrane. Organic matter is a common 
source of membrane fouling, and it follows that fluorescence measurement of organic 
matter has gained traction in the analysis and investigation of how organic fouling occurs 
in these systems. Whether it is microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, or reverse and 
forward osmosis, using flat sheet, hollow fiber, tubular, or spiral wound constructions, there 
is nearly always a way in which fluorescence measurements can be, and has been applied.

Experimental Methods for Membrane ApplicationsThese methods can assist in evaluating the membrane structure, the process performance in 
general, and of course the level and character of fouling. However, the construction, matrix, 
and analytical targets for each of these specific applications will determine how fluorescence 
EEM spectroscopy can, and cannot, be used in each case.
Section 11.3 has highlighted two physical application differences: (1) front-face fluorescence 
spectroscopy; and (2) right-angle fluorescence spectroscopy. Both methods can be used to 
assess and/or predict organic fouling, though in different ways and typically for different 
applications. Front-face fluorescence EEM spectroscopy currently finds its most common 
(membrane-related) use for systems such as MBRs (membrane bioreactors), or direct 
measurement from fouled membrane surfaces. Regardless of whether front-face or right-
angle fluorescence is used, the organic character of any fouling will be dependent on both 
the feed, and the physical and/or chemical characteristics of the membrane in use.
The direct, in situ fluorescence analysis of membranes has to date been carried out in 
different ways in order to understand the main organic components behind the organic 
fouling of membrane surfaces. For example, Yamamura et al., (2019) used in situ front-face 
EEM spectroscopy to investigate the organic fouling of PVDF membranes from secondary 
treated wastewater, in a bench-scale study. They observed increasing intensities with time 
over three main peaks, and by combining intermittent backwashing with EEM analysis, 
the authors observed peaks which were predominantly associated with reversible and/
or irreversible fouling. Yu et al., (2019), also utilised front-face fluorescence to detect and 
quantify model foulants on UF membranes, and concluded that it was a better method than 
liquid right-angle fluorescence in this particular study due to lower standard deviations 
observed between repeated measurements (see Figure 6). Pawlowski et al., (2016) used 
front-face fluorescence to monitor fouling deposition on ion-exchange membranes. In this 
study, the authors found it to be a useful tool in evaluating reverse electrodialysis processes, 
and particularly for increasing membrane cleaning efficiencies. 
Similar front-face techniques have also been used to investigate activated sludge systems 
(Huaorng, 2022), to quantify biomass and bioactivity amongst other parameters. From 
a practical spectroscopy perspective, these can be likened to the sludge and mixed liquor 
components of MBRs. The fluorescence character of the sludge over time can be linked 
to the evolution of fouling on the membranes, as the organic matter in particular EPS 
(extracellular polymeric substances) has been found to be closely related to TMP (Chen et 
al., 2018). Various iterations of front-face spectroscopy have been used for assessing both 
the sludge and membrane components of MBR systems in situ (Galinha and Crespo, 2022).

measured by liquid right-angle EEM and front-faced fluorescence EEM measurements 
(adapted from Yu et al . (2019)).
Looking beyond front-face fluorescence EEM spectroscopy, the more common method 
of analysing membrane performance has historically been by a direct measurement of 
the different liquid streams with right-angle fluorescence. This is due to the higher signal 
and higher sensitivity that is achieved by this method, though front-face fluorescence 
spectroscopy has been described and utilised for high absorbance liquid samples for nearly 
half a century (Eisinger and Flores, 1979). In the case of membrane systems, using the 
right-angle fluorescence method typically means a comparison of one or more out of the 
feed, permeate, and concentrate streams. Whether some, or all, of these streams can be 
analysed with right-angle fluorescence will depend on whether the target matrix adheres 
to the requirements set out in section 11.4 Quality Assurance. Primarily, the liquid matrix 
must exhibit low absorbance values, which either are below the threshold where they can 
be considered negligible, or within the mathematically correctable range. In the latter case, 
an absorbance measurement must accompany the fluorescence measurement to guarantee 
accurate values.

Experimental Methods for Membrane ApplicationsFor example, Poojamnong (2020) used right-angle fluorescence to compare the feed 
and permeate EEMs of an MBR treating pulp and paper wastewater. This study found 
protein-like fluorescence to be the most reduced region from the feed to the permeate, 
which correlated to the main component of the fouling formed on the UF membranes. A 
comparison of feed and permeates from RO processes of water recycling plants have also 
shown that right-angle fluorescence EEM could be used to monitor organics rejection and 
membrane integrity (Pype et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2015). Bagastyo et 
al., (2011) identified humic and fulvic-like organics, as well as soluble microbial products 
as the main constituents of the concentrate stream within an RO system treating secondary 
wastewater effluent.
A direct analysis of already fouled membranes can also be performed with right-angle 
fluorescence EEM spectroscopy. Stripping off individual foulant layers by, for example, 
backwashing, or acid/base washing, has been used to understand differences in the formation 
of membrane foulant layers. In 2004, Kimura et al. (2004) showed that alkaline cleaning 
removed primarily protein-like fluorescence from membranes fouled by surface water. 
Henderson et al. (2011) also found that protein-like fluorescence was the predominant 
fluorescence region that was removed through a three-step UF membrane cleaning 
procedure. More specifically, in this case a low UV ‘tyrosine-like’ fluorescence component 
found within 5 different sources of wastewater, was found to be highly correlated to 
membrane fouling potential. In a study that investigated the role of DOM in the fouling 
of membrane bioreactors (MBR) treating wastewater, Tang et al. (2010) also found that 
two protein-like fluorescence components were most correlated to membrane fouling. 
These and other similar studies highlight how EEM spectroscopy can be used effectively 
to gain insight into how different foulant layers form, and therefore how to minimise their 
formation. 
Further to the direct observation of various fluorescent membrane fouling components, 
studies have also investigated different pre-treatment steps to remove these components 
and hence minimise organic fouling. For example, Wang et al. (2017) utilised liquid EEM 
analysis to compare the performance and effect of 8 different types of powder activated 
carbon (PAC), as a pre-treatment to UF membrane treatment. They showed that whilst 
initial fouling was linked to the humic-like fluorescence region, ultimately the ability 
of PAC to minimise irreversible fouling was linked to how well it absorbed protein-like 
fluorescence.  Aftab et al. (2020) applied combinations of different pre-treatment processes 
to change the FDOM character of landfill leachate, in order to compare how the resulting 
organics character ultimately affected NF fouling. This study concluded that both fulvic-like 
and protein-like fluorescence was more linked to irreversible fouling, than was humic-like 
fluorescence. In slight contrast to this, Xu et al. (2022) concluded that both proteins and 
humics contributed to the initial pore blocking stage, though the study was conducted on 
synthetic mixtures and model foulant compounds. Through a combination of size exclusion 
chromatography and liquid fluorescence EEM analysis, Haberkamp et al. (2011) also showed 
that protein-like fluorescence correlated with the extent of hydraulically irreversible fouling 
of UF membranes by secondary effluents. In this case, the authors also showed that chemical 
coagulation and biological sand filtration as pre-treatment were both able to significantly 
reduce membrane fouling. Furthermore, in a study that investigated dissolved air flotation 
as a potential pre-treatment for membrane desalination, Shutova et al. (2016) showed

The studies that have been mentioned in this section are but a small proportion of the 
many research applications of fluorescence EEM spectroscopy within membrane treatment 
systems to date. While they highlight the method as a clear and practical use for measuring 
organic fouling on membranes, it is nevertheless imperative to keep in mind that only a 
fraction of OM is fluorescent. Although the fluorescent fraction is typically considered to 
be representative of OM as a whole, a better overall picture of OM and OM-based fouling 
will nearly always be attained when it is applied in combination with other analytical tools.
Within the near future, further advances in optical technology and computer processing 
power look to be the main impetus’ behind further development and wider application of 
fluorescence sensors in membrane systems. As optical sensors become cheaper and more 
sensitive, and light sources become more stable with higher output and tighter bandwidths 
(particularly at lower wavelengths) fluorescence spectroscopy will become even more 
practical and accessible for both research and industry applications.
