Plentiful production of the synthetic dyes is directly interrelated with the
soil and waterpollution. Therefore,to overcome this problem and its mitiga-
tion is always been serious and important issue worldwide. Application of
microbial enzymes to remediate these recalcitrant compounds from the en-
vironment is very well-knownbiological solution, which is effective since
last few decades. Present study deals with application of ligninolytic en-
zymes produced by a wild strain of Phanerochaetechrysosporiumto de-
grade four reactive textile dyesviz. Reactive Red HE8B, Reactive Black B,
Reactive Golden Yellow HR, and Reactive Violet 5R. The fungus was ob-
tained from the decaying wood log of the tree growing Junagadh Forest of
Gujarat State.It is not only proved to be potential strain
indecolourisationofdyes but also proficiently degraded all the dyes under
solid and liquid decolourisation media. The decolourisation and degrada-
tion study was efficiently supported by the FTIR analysis of dyes treated
with ligninolytic enzymes produced by solid state fermentation.On plate
ddecolourisation of dyes initiated after threedays of fungal inoculation
and the petri plates with 10 mg/L concentration of all four dyes were com-
pletely decolourised within 11 days, except Reactive Red HE8B which took
13 days after incubation. Supplementation of different sources of carbon
and nitrogeninfluencedthe process of decolourisation, in which dextrose
and asparagines were found to be excellent supporters
respectively.Interestingly one of the nitrogen sources i.e. sodium nitrite
inhibited growth of the fungus.Influence of inoculum size on
decolourisation was performed with different inocula size on solid and in
liquid media, where onetothreediscs (10mm diameter agar plugs) were re-
ported to be more effective in the rate of the decolourisation.

INTRODUCTION
The Indian textile industry counts among the lead-
ing textile manufacturersin the world and is the sec-
ond largest producer of textilesand garments[11] whereGujarat state is one of the textile hub and apparel
zone in the western part of India. Synthetic dyes are
considered to be the pillars for the textile indus-
tries, among which azo dyes are the largest group
used by the dying and printing houses. They containVolume 9 Issue 8

the azo group (-N=N-) as the chromophores which
makes them recalcitrant to the degradation and there-
fore exhibits the acute toxic effect on the flora and
fauna. To mitigatethis challenge, severalphysico-
chemical treatment technologies have been
developedworld wide but unfortunately most of them
are proved ineffective due to the chemical stability
of these pollutants. Therefore,most effortsare now
concentrating to the biological methods where mi-
croorganisms are used to meet the desired
depollution.
Perusal of literature indicates that
decolourisation and degradation of differentazo dyes
has been studied thoroughly by using bacteria as the
biological agent.Beside bacteria, application of
white rot fungi has also received a considerable at-
tention owing to the action of extracellular non-spe-
cific enzymes produced by them. The
ligninolyticenzymes produced by white rot fungi
have the potential to degrade complex compound
such as lignin in their natural environment. This prop-
erty of these enzymes can be efficiently applied in
degradation of synthetic dyes which has similar
chemical structures like lignin. Therefore, different
white rot fungi are extensively studied for their ap-
plication in bioremediation of textile dyes to coun-
teract environmental pollution[12,23,24,25]. Among them,
P.chrysosporium has been studied widely due to its
vital role in the process of biodegradation[2,8,9,15,23,33].
The virtue of our study with the same fungus lies in
its wild collection from the forest of Gujarat state
(India) which has not been explored earlier. In our
previous study, P.chrysosporium was investigated
for their enzyme production through Solid state fer-
mentation and biodegradation of reactive dyes. Main
objective of the present study was to
examinewhether:i) decolourisation of all four reac-
tive dyes with different structures and ëmaxoccurs at
the same rate in solid and liquid medium? ii) Inocu-
lum size and supplementation of different carbon and
nitrogen sources to growth media influence the pro-
cess of decolourisations and degradation?iii) Dyes
are decolourised or show any structural alteration
after treating with the ligninolytic enzymes produced
byP. chrysosporium?MATERIAL AND METHODS
Isolation, purification and screening of the fun-
gus
Several white rot basidiomycetesfungi were col-
lected from the different forest of the Gujarat state.
They were surface sterilized by routine method us-
ing 0.1% of HgCl2 and 70% ethanol. The treated
samples were inoculated on different growth media
and incubated at room temperature (28-38° C). Iso-
lated strains were purified by serial culture and
maintained on optimized media i.e. Malt Extract Agar
(MEA) at 4°C. All the purified strains were screened
for production of ligninolyticenzymes, from which
KSR17 was selected for the study and molecular
identification was done with the help ofChromous
Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore (India). The fungus was
identified as Phanerochaetechrysosporium and the
sequence was submitted to NCBI with accession
number AB361645.
Chemicals and dyes
Malt extract powder and the sugars used in the
study were obtained from Himedia (India). DMAB
(3-dimethyl amino benzoic acid), MBTH (3-methyl-
2-benzothioazolinone hydrazinehydrochloride),
H2O2 and Manganese Sulphate (MnSO4) were pur-
chased from National chemicals Ltd., (India). The
nitrogen sources were obtained from Qualigen (In-
dia). All four water soluble textile dyes (Reactive
Red HE8B, Reactive Black B, Reactive Golden Yel-
low HR, and Reactive Violet 5R)used in the present
study were obtained from the dying, printing and pro-
cessing houses. Other chemicals acquired for the
studies were of analytical grade.
Dye decolourisation
Decolourisation studies of four different reac-
tive dyes were carried out in both the solid and liq-
uid media. Solid plate decolourisation was per-
formed by supplementing five different concentra-
tions (10, 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/L) of each dye
along with the control after autoclaving MEAmedia
(2%). Plates were inoculated centrally with 10mm
diameter agar disc from the seven days old culture
of P. chrysosporium. Decolourisation of the dyes. 296 Application of ligninolytic fungus in decolourisation and degradation

was monitored at the regular interval and zone of
growth and decolourisation was measured.
Liquid decolourisation was performed in 150
mL Erlenmeyer flask each containing 25 mL of auto-
claved Malt Extract (ME) broth (2%) supplemented
with respective dye (10mg/L). All the flasks were
inoculated with 3 disks of 10mm diameter agar plugs
from actively growing culture and maintained at
static condition in incubator at 27o C. The inocu-
lated flasks were harvested at the regular interval
and the filtrate was subjected to the spectrophoto-
metric analysis at the maximum visible wavelength
of absorbance (max) for individual dyes in order to
monitor the decolourisation. The percent
decolourisation was calculated by following equa-
tion.
P% = A0  A1 × 100
A0
Where, P% is the percentage decolourisation, A0
and A1 represent the initial and final concentrations
of azodyes respectively.
All the experiments were performed in tripli-
cates and average values were considered.
Influence of carbon and nitrogen sources on
decolourisation
Five different carbon (dextrose, sucrose, fruc-
tose, maltose and lactose) and nitrogen (ammonium
sulphate, sodium nitrite, asparagine, and urea)
sources were added to the medium as the co-sub-
strates at the concentration of 10 mg/L and checked
for their effect on the decolourisation on both solid
and liquid decolourisation. The influence of these
substrates on solid plate decolourisation was con-
ducted by inoculating the plates containing respec-
tive dye, media and carbon/nitrogen source as co-
substrate with 10mm agar plugs from the actively
growing culture. The zone of growth and
decolourisation was measured at the regular inter-
val and uninoculated plates were treated as controls.
In case of liquid decolourisation 150 mL flasks con-
taining media, respective dye and carbon/nitrogen
sources (1%) were inoculated with 3 plugs of 10mm
diameter from the P.chrysosporium plates and
analysed through spectrophotometric analysis after
every 3 days.Influence of inoculum size on decolourisation
Petri plates containing MEA with the dyes were
inoculated with the four different inoculum sizes (1
to 5, 10mm diameter agar plugs) and zone of growth
and decolourisation were measured at the regular
interval to find out the most appropriate inoculum
size for the optimum decolourisation. However, the
effect of inoculum size on liquid decolourisation was
measured by inoculating the ME broth with differ-
ent inoculum size (3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 of 10mm di-
ameter agar plugs). All the flasks were harvested on
the 5th day of inoculation and filtrate was subjected
to the spectrophotometric analysis where the flasks
with only medium without dye were considered as
control and un-inoculated flasks with medium and
respective dyes were considered as blank.
Enzyme production, partial purification and mo-
lecular weight determination
The potential of enzyme production by the fun-
gus was carried out using the solid state fermenta-
tion technique where different agro-industrial wastes
were used to optimize the substrate. Among differ-
ent agro-industrial wastes used, wheat straw was
found to be the best substrate;therefore, further stud-
ies were carried out by using wheat straw for the
optimisation of inoculum size and incubation time.
Enzyme assay was performed following the method
described by Vyas et al.[3]. Partial purification of the
crude enzyme was carried out by ammonium sul-
phate precipitation method as described by[26]. The
molecular weight of the partially purified enzyme
was evaluated by Electrophoresis method described
by Laemmli[31]. Further details are as described ear-
lier by Koyani et al.[25].
Biodegradation analysis by FTIR (Fourier trans-
form infrared spectroscopy)
Degradation of the dyes using the partially puri-
fied enzyme was corroboratedby FTIR analysis of
dyes treated with partially purified enzymes. For
each dyes, concentration of 10 mg/Lwas prepared
in 10mLand treated with 500µL of partially purified
enzyme for 48 hours and then dried at the room tem-
perature. The powder was processed byKBr pellet
method (Mane et al.2008). The samples wereRina D.Koyani and Kishore S.Rajput 297

analysed with 30 scan speed at 10-4 resolution, in
the mid region of 500- 4000 cm -1 by using Shimadzu
8400.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Dye decolourisation
The magnitude of the research efforts initiated
in the last decade on the degradation oftextile dyes
reveals seriousness of the environmental problem
caused due to reckless disposal of textile effluents
released in the environment[24]. Various physico-
chemical methods have been tried to overcome the
problem of environment deterioration but recalci-
trant compounds remained unresolved due to com-
plex chemical structure. As an alternative, biologi-
cal treatment of the textile dyes using white rot fungi
is the best cost effective and environmental friendly
approachover physical and chemical techniques.
Therefore, several studies were carried out in search
of potential fungus that can efficiently decolouriseand
degrade different recalcitrant compounds. In the
present study, P.chrysosporiuma wild isolate from
the decaying wood exploited and it is proved to be
potential organism to degrade four reactive textile
dyes (viz.Reactive Red HE8B, Reactive Black B,
Reactive Golden Yellow HR, and Reactive Violet
5R). Ten mg/L concentration of each dye was com-
pletely degraded in both solid and liquid media in
11 days of fungal inoculation except Reactive red
HE8B which took 13 days for complete
decolourisation (Figures 1, 2a-h). Delay indecolourisation of Reactive red HE8B may be as-
sociated with its more recalcitrant nature due to
chemical structure. Similar correlation about com-
plexity of dye structures and decolourisation of syn-
thetic dyes has also been established earlier stud-

ies[1,7]. Time required for the decolourisation also
depends on the concentration of the dyes used in
the[25]. All other four concentrations of the dyes tested
in the present investigation were also been
decolourised successfully but the time required for
the same increased with the increase in concentra-
tion of dyes from 10, 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/L
(Figure 2). All dyes upto the concentration of 100mg/
L were decolourised rapidly but thereafter it became
slow and the concentration above 1 g/L was found
to be inhibitory for the growth of the fungus and rate
of decolourisation.
Influence of carbon and nitrogen sources on
decolourisation
Available literature indicates that supplementa-
tion of growth media with various carbon and nitro-
gen sources boost the potential of enzyme produc-
tion ability of fungus[16,17,19,20,21,] which is directly
related with the rate of dye decolourisation and deg-radation. Therefore, in order to examine the influ-
ence of carbon and nitrogen sources on
decolourisation,both liquid and solid media were
supplemented with10 mg/L of five different carbon
(Dextrose, Sucrose, Lactose, Maltose and Fructose)
and nitrogen (Ammoniumsulphate, Urea, Asparagine,
Sodium nitrate and Sodium nitrite) sources respec-
tively. Among them,only dextrose and asparagine
were found to be more proficient decolourising raiser
as carbon and nitrogen sources respectively while
others showed minor or undetectable variation in
the rate of decolourisation. Carliellet al.[3] and
Kapdanet al.[13] also reported that growth media
supplemented with glucose enhanced the rate of
decolourisation. Surprisingly, one of the nitrogen
sources i.e. sodium nitrite was noted to be growth
inhibitor (Figure 3).
There are no unanimous opinions about the role
of nutrient supplements in the process of dye

decolourisation. Available literature indicates that
glucose was found to play important role in sup-
porting decolourisation[3,13,30]. Similarly supplemen-
tation of nitrogen sources also enhancesthe produc-
tion ligninolytic enzyme and ultimately the rate ofdye
decolourisation[6]. On contrary to the present study,
results obtained by[12] did not show any direct rela-
tionship between the carbon sources and
decolourisation capacity of the strains. Irpexlacteus
showed suppressed activity of enzymes in presence
of nitrogen sources. On the other hand, Mester and
Field[29], and Gianfreda et al. [17], noticed that some
white rot fungi do not show any effect of carbon and
nitrogen sources on ligninolytic enzyme production
in the expected trend.
Effect of inoculum size on decolourisation
It is the general notion that larger size of inocu-
lum shall fasten the rate of decolourisation. There-
fore, the relationship between inoculum size and rate
of decolourisation was investigated by inoculating
1 to 5 agar plugs (10mm diameter)per petri plate
onthe solid decolourisation media whilefive differ-
ent inocula size i.e. 3, 6, 9, 12, 15agar plugs (10mm
diameter) per flask were inoculated inliquid media.
Far away from our general perception that increase
in the inoculum size could increase decolourisation
rate but no such correlation was observed in the
present study. One-three inoculum size was proved
to be more efficient in solid and liquid
decolourisation respectively whileno significant dif-
ference was observed in the rate of decolourisation
when inocula size is being increased (Figure 4).
Enzyme production, partial purification and mo-
lecular weight determination
Solid state fermentation is always considered to
be better methodology for the ligninolytic enzyme
production as it mimics the natural habitat of the
fungi[10]. Among all different solid substrates (i.e.
wheat straw, saw dust, banana stem, rice straw, sug-
arcane bagasse, ground nut shells) used for the en-
zyme production, wheat straw was found to be more
promising for the optimum production of Manganese
Peroxidase, Manganese Independent Peroxidase and
Laccasei.e. 487.9 IU/mL, 475.92 IU/mL,177.32 IU/mLrespectively[25]. Earlier studies have also proved
Wheat straw as the better substrate for the ligninolytic
enzyme[4,18,34]. Crude enzyme produced by
P.chrysosporium was subjected to the partial puri-
fication through ammonium sulphate precipitation
method at 4°C and up to 80% saturation. The maxi-
mum enzyme activity for manganese peroxidase
(607.35 IU/mL), manganese independent peroxidase
(539.27 IU/mL) and laccase (263.03 IU/mL) was
exhibited in the 60% saturated fraction which was
further experimented to the molecular weight deter-
mination. In the present investigation, ligninolytic
enzyme produced by the P.chrysosporium was of
52.8kDa molecular weight[25]. which is slightly
higher than the previous report (40kDa) by Tien and
Kirk[22].
Biodegradation analysis by FTIR (Fourier trans-
form infrared spectroscopy)
Phanerochaetechrysosporiumnot only
decolourisedall the dyes testedbut it alsodisrupted
thecomplex structure of dyes. It wasevident
fromspectra obtained by Fourier Transform Infra-
red Spectroscopy analysis of treated and untreated
dyes. Degradation of chemical structure of dyes di-
rectly entails the ligninolytic system of the white rot
fungi. Different stretching vibrations expressed the
existence of different groups present in the dyes
while in degraded samples shifting of the peaks is
evident in Figure 5.Previous literature has also been
supported by the similar degradation studies and
shifting of the peaks in the degraded samples[25,27,28].
CONCLUSION
The present investigation wild isolate of P.
chrysosporium is revealed as potent strain to
decolouriseand degrade four reactive textile dyes
under solid and liquid media. Rate of dye
decolourisation is influenced by the complexity of
chemical structure and concentration of the dyes.
Among the all treated dyes Reactive Red HE8B was
found to be very complex, while increase in con-
centration of the dyes decreases the rate of
decolourisation. Other parameters like carbon and
nitrogen sources and inoculum size also influencedRina D.Koyani and Kishore S.Rajput 301

the process of dye decolourisation. The role of
ligninolytic enzymes in degradation of the dyes was
confirmed by FTIR analysis of the samples treated
with partially purified enzymes, whichshowed
stretching vibrations in different chemical groups
within different dyes investigated. The present study
demonstrates that P.chrysosporium has potential not
only to decolourise but also degrade the complex
reactive textile dyes through its ligninolytic enzyme
system. Further studies are warranted on the analy-
sis of degraded dye products for their toxicity after
treatment.
