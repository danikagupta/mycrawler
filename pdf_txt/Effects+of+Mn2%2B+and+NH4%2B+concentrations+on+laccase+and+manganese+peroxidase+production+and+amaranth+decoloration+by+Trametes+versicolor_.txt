e-mail: kondo@brs.kyushu-u.ac.jpAbstract Manganese peroxidase (MnP) production by
Phlebia sp. MG-60 is strongly regulated by Mn2/H11001 and NH4/H11001
at various sea salt incubation conditions. Extra-added Mn2/H11001
and NH4/H11001 obviously inhibited MnP production, but sea salts
relieved the inhibition partially or completely. Three media
were prepared: Kirk medium with addition of 0%–5% sea
salts (KS medium), a high level of Mn2/H11001 (300mg/l) in KS
medium (HM-KS medium), and a high level of NH4/H11001
(430mg/l) in KS medium (HN-KS medium). Without addi-
tion of sea salts, the dye Poly R-478 was signiﬁcantly decol-orized by low MnP activity (about 200 U/l) and a low level
of laccase activity (about 100U/l) in KS and HM-KS media.
In the cultures in which laccase activity was almost com-pletely inhibited by 3% and 5% sea salts, MnP activityhigher than 400U/l was necessary for Poly R-478 decolori-zation in all of the three media. We ﬁrst report the linear
correlation of MnP activity and decolorization of Poly R-
478 under saline conditions and the effect of laccase on thisrelation.

Introduction
White-rot fungi are regarded as the microorganisms re-sponsible for biodegradation of lignin, the second mostabundant natural polymer on earth. The ligninolytic en-zymes lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase(MnP), and laccase are all or partly secreted by white rotfungi and regulated by culture conditions.
1–5 Several
important culture parameters (e.g., carbon source, nutrientnitrogen concentration, ion strength, oxygen, and pH) havebeen widely investigated to understand the factors thataffect ligninolytic enzyme production and lignin
degradation.
6–8
In previous reports we observed that a white rot marine
isolate, Phlebia sp. MG-60, showed high deligniﬁcation
and dye decolorization ability,9,10 and its MnP production
was strongly enhanced by sea salts.11 Until now, our under-
standing of the MnP secreted by saline-tolerant white
rot fungi under marine incubation conditions has been
limited. To increase our knowledge of the factors thatinﬂuence MnP production by the salt-tolerant white rotmarine isolate Phlebia sp. MG-60, we investigated the
effects of Mn
2/H11001 and NH4/H11001 on its MnP production and Poly
R-478 decolorization under various sea salt incubation
conditions. The dependence of Poly R-478 decolorizationon ligninolytic enzymes at various incubation conditionswas also studied, and the results are summarized in thispaper.
Materials and methods
Microorganism
The white-rot marine isolate Phlebia sp. MG-609 was main-
tained in potato-dextrose agar (PDA) (Difco Laboratories)slants at 4°C before being used.
Medium preparations
A liquid medium that contained glucose 10.00g/l, ammo-
nium tartrate 0.221g/l, sodium acetate 1.64g/l, Tween 80
1.00g/l, Kirk’s salt solution, and trace elements
12 was used as
the basal medium in the present research. All factors thataffect MnP production and decolorization of Poly R-478were investigated at various salt concentrations: 0%, 3%,or 5% (w/v) sea salts (Sigma). The medium containing356
different concentrations of sea salts is called KS medium.
To determine the effect of Mn2/H11001 on MnP production
and decolorization, the Mn2/H11001 level in KS medium
(60mg/l) was adjusted to 300mg/l (HM-KS) by addingappropriate amounts of MnSO
4·H2O, and the pH was
kept at 4.5. To determine the effect of NH4/H11001 on MnP pro-
duction and decolorization, the low concentration ofnitrogen in the KS medium
11 was replaced by a high concen-
tration of nitrogen (HN-KS); the NH4/H11001 concentration was
430 mg/l.
Culture conditions and crude enzyme preparations
The strain Phlebia sp. MG-60 was preincubated on PDA
in petri dishes (diameter 9 cm) at 30°C for 7 days. Thepreincubated strain was then inoculated into a 100-mlErlenmeyer ﬂask containing 10 ml of KS, HM-KS, or HN-KS medium. After stationary incubation at 30°C, the cul-ture was separated by ﬁltration with glass ﬁber paper and
0.45µm membrane ﬁlters (Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Japan), and
the supernatant was used as crude enzymes.
Decolorization of Poly R-478
The ability of Phlebia sp. MG-60 to degrade Poly R-478 was
estimated in KS, HM-KS, and HN-KS media, respectively.KS, HM-KS, and HN-KS media (10 ml) containing 0.02%
Poly R-478 was sterilized, inoculated, and then incubated
at 30°C without shaking. After incubation, the culture wasﬁltered with glass ﬁber paper and 0.45- µm membrane ﬁlters.
The supernatant was used to determine absorbance at513nm and 362 nm for decolorization ability
13 and enzyme
activity. Noninoculated medium that contained 0.02% Poly
R-478 was used as the control. The colors of the mycelia
incubated under the various incubation conditions werecompared with that of the control. No obvious changeswere observed. Therefore, Poly R-478 was not adsorbed bythe mycelium. The decolorization ability was expressed asfollows.

Enzyme assays
The MnP activity was determined by monitoring the oxida-
tion of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol at 470nm.14 Crude enzyme was
added to a solution containing 1.0mM 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
and 1.0mM MnSO4 in 50mM malonate buffer (pH 4.5), and
the reaction was initiated with hydrogen peroxide (0.2mM)in a ﬁnal volume of 1ml. Laccase activity was measured bymonitoring the oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol at 470nmin 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0).
14 One unit of enzyme
activity is deﬁned as 1 µmol quinone dimer of 2,6-DMP
produced in 1min ( ε /H11005 49600m/H110021cm/H110021).Results
Effect of Mn2/H11001 on MnP production
The MnP production in KS medium at various sea salt
cultures was described in our previous report11 and is shown
here in Fig. 1 to compare the MnP activities at various Mn2/H11001
and NH4/H11001 conditions. Figure 2 shows the effect of Mn2/H11001 on
MnP production. The peak activity of MnP produced at 0%sea salts in HM-KS medium occurred around the same time(day 10 of incubation) as that in the KS medium, and the
activity was only one-third of that in the KS medium. That
is, the high Mn
2/H11001 concentration (300mg/l) inhibited MnP
production at the 0% sea salt incubation condition, but itdid not obviously affect MnP secretion in HM-KS media at3% sea salts. More interestingly, the MnP activity in HM-KS was enhanced about fourfold by 5% sea salts compared
with that in KS medium at the same salt condition.

Effect of NH4/H11001 on MnP production
MnP production in HN-KS medium with or without addi-
tion of sea salts is illustrated in Fig. 3. With or withoutthe addition of sea salts to the culture, MnP productionwas inhibited by the higher NH
4/H11001 concentration in HN-KS
medium than in KS medium. Among the three sea salt
conditions, MnP production was least inhibited at 5%.
Effect of sea salts on Poly R-478 decolorization
Decolorization of Poly R-478 by Phlebia  sp. MG-60 in
KS medium is shown in Fig. 4. The results demon-strated that decolorization of Poly R-478 was obviouslyinhibited by high concentrations of sea salts at the begin-ning of the incubation, although it was increased to an
almost comparable degree at 2 weeks after inoculation.
The lignin-modifying enzyme activities were determined
during decolorization in KS medium (Figs. 5, 6). Sea salts at
both 3% and 5% concentrations enhanced MnP productionwhen the fungus was used to decolorize Poly R-478 in KSmedium. At 3% or 5% sea salt concentrations, laccaseactivity was strongly inhibited during decolorization ofPoly R-478 (Fig. 6).

Effect of Mn2/H11001 on Poly R-478 decolorization
The effect of Mn2/H11001 on Poly R-478 decolorization can be
observed by comparing Fig. 7 with Fig. 4. When 3% sea saltswas or was not added to the culture, higher Mn
2/H11001 inhibited
decolorization of Poly R-478 slightly more in HM-KS me-dium than that in KS medium. In contrast, Mn
2/H11001 enhanced
the decolorization process at the beginning of incubation
under the 5% sea salt condition.
The MnP and laccase activities were examined to deter-
mine if there is a relation between ligninolytic enzymes anddecolorization of Poly R-478. The results are shown in Figs.8 and 9. Similar to that in KS medium, sea salts enhancedMnP production in HM-KS medium during the decoloriza-
tion process. At 3% and 5% sea salt concentrations, Mn
2/H11001
contents in either KS or HM-KS medium did not have anyeffect on laccase activity. However, the cultivation day
of the peak laccase activity was different for the KS and
HM-KS media under the 0% sea salt incubation condi-tion, although their maximum activity was not obviouslydifferent.
Effect of NH
4/H11001 on Poly R-478 decolorization
The effect of NH4/H11001 concentration on Poly R-478 decoloriza-
tion can be investigated by comparing Fig. 10 with Fig. 4. In
HN-KS medium decolorization was inhibited strongly at0% sea salts, inhibited at 3% sea salts, but accelerated at5% sea salts.
The time courses of MnP activity of MG-60 during decol-
orization in HN-KS medium are shown in Fig. 11. Compar-

Poly R-478 in HN-KS medium at 0% ( circles ), 3% ( triangles ), and 5%

ing Fig. 11 with Fig. 5 shows that the maximum MnP activity
did not obviously change in KS or HN-KS media at 0% seasalts. In contrast, maximum MnP activity occurred earlier(day 10) in HN-KS medium than in KS medium (day 12)
(Fig. 5) with 5% sea salt concentration. Laccase production
was enhanced about ﬁvefold in HN-KS medium comparedto that in KS medium under the 0% sea salt condition(Fig. 12).
Relations between cumulate MnP activity
and decolorization
The relations between the cumulate MnP activity and de-
colorization of Poly R-478 in KS, HM-KS, and HN-KS me-dia are shown in Table 1. Regardless of the medium, laccaseactivity was totally inhibited by 5% sea salts (Figs. 6, 9, 12),
and the decolorization of Poly R-478 had good linear corre-lation with the cumulate MnP activity at this sea salt condi-tion. Laccase activity was not totally inhibited at 3% sea saltconditions (Figs. 6, 9, 12), and the linear correlation be-
tween MnP activity and decolorization was not as good as
that at the 5% sea salt condition but better than that at 0%sea salt concentration. The fungus secreted laccase in thethree media at 0% sea salts (Figs. 6, 9, 12), and the laccaseseemed to affect greatly the linear relation between thecumulate MnP activity and decolorization of Poly R-478.
Discussion
It has been demonstrated that MnP production could beenhanced by adding Mn
2/H11001 to the medium,5,15 although it
appeared to be inhibited by an Mn2/H11001 concentration higher
than 40ppm.3 In the present study, the added Mn2/H11001
(240ppm) in HM-KS medium obviously inhibited MnP
production by Phlebia  sp. MG-60 without the addition of
sea salts, but the inhibition was almost completely relievedwith 3% sea salts. Moreover, MnP production was im-proved by Mn
2/H11001 at a 5% sea salt concentration in the
HM-KS medium. The results indicated that a high Mn2/H11001
concentration inhibits MnP production by Phlebia sp. MG-
60, but sea salts can relieve this inhibition.
Although many reports demonstrated that most white
rot fungi secrete more MnP at a low nitrogen concentrationthan that at a high nitrogen concentration, MnP production
by some white rot fungi was higher in nitrogen-rich culture
than in nitrogen-limited culture.
5,7,16 Our results indicated
that NH4/H11001 had a different inﬂuence on MnP production by
Phlebia sp. MG-60 under different sea salt concentrations.
As the sea salts relieved the inhibition caused by Mn2/H11001 on
MnP production by Phlebia sp. MG-60, they also reduced
the inhibitory effect of NH4/H11001 on MnP production. The added
Mn2/H11001 and NH4/H11001 inhibited MnP production by Phlebia sp.
MG-60 in KS medium, but the inhibition was partially orcompletely relieved by the presence of sea salts, especially5% sea salts. This interesting phenomenon will be furtherinvestigated in our laboratory.
Decolorization of polymeric dyes by microorganisms is
regarded as a simple, rapid method to investigate theirligninolytic system.

NH4/H11001 on lignin degradation by Phlebia sp. MG-60, Poly
R-478 was added to the incubation cultures and the decol-orization ability of the fungus was evaluated under variousincubation conditions.
The effects of Mn
2/H11001 on decolorization of Poly R-478
were different at 0%, 3%, and 5% sea salt concentrations.
Without addition of sea salts to the system, a high Mn2/H11001
concentration in HM-KS inhibited the decolorization abil-
ity of the fungus. After adding 5% sea salts, however, thedecolorization ability improved, although it was still lowerthan that at 0% and 3% sea salt concentrations. Based on
these results, it can be concluded that sea salts and Mn
2/H11001
have certain coordinated effects on the fungal decoloriza-
tion of Poly R-478. The effect of NH4/H11001 on decolorization of
Poly R-478 at different sea salt concentrations gave resultssimilar to those seen with Mn
2/H11001; that is, sea salts at 5%
released the inhibition of NH4/H11001 on decolorization.
It has been reported that a minimum MnP concentration
of about 200 U/l was needed to start Poly R-478 decoloriza-tion, and higher amounts of MnP did not improve the de-colorization levels.
17 In our study, however, MnP activity
higher than 400U/l was necessary for Poly R-478 decolori-zation in all three media when laccase activity was almost
completely inhibited by 3% and 5% sea salts. When laccase
(about 100U/l) was produced in KS and HM-KS media at0% sea salts, an MnP concentration lower than 200U/l alsoefﬁciently decolorized Poly R-478. The relation betweenthe cumulate MnP activity and decolorization of Poly R-478at various sea salt concentrations in three media are showed
in Table 1. The decolorization of Poly R-478 had the best
linear correlation ( r
2) with cumulate MnP activity under 5%
sea salt conditions in the three media. The linear correlationbetween the cumulate MnP activity and Poly R-478 decol-orization was not as good under the 0% sea salt incubationcondition as that at 5% sea salts because it was strongly
affected by laccase. We therefore conclude that MnP plays
the most important role in Poly R-478 decolorization, but acertain amount of laccase activity is necessary.
