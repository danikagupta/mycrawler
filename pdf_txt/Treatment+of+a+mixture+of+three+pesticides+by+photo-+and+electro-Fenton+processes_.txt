 Abstract  
In recent years, more and more  refractory  and toxic organic contaminants are 
detected  in wastewater,  surface water and ground water.  Many of these organic pollutants 
can hardly be degraded by conventional water treatments. Advanced oxidation processes 
(AOPs), which based on in situ generation of strong oxidants, mainly the generation of 
hydroxyl radicals (•OH), have been applied to tre at various non -biodegradable organic 
compounds in water. Conventional Fenton technology is a promising AOP for the 
treatment of organic contaminants in water. In Fenton process, hydroxyl radical , which is 
the second strongest oxidant  (after fluorine) , is formed through Fenton ’s reaction and then 
degrade organic pollutants. Similar to conventional Fenton process, transition metal ions 
(Fe2+, Co2+, Ag+, etc. ) can also activate persulfate (PS) and generate sulfate radicals 
(SO 4•–). Sulfate radical is a powerful oxidant and can oxidize most of organic pollutants. 
This process is named Fenton -like process . There are some disadvantages existed in 
conventional Fenton and Fenton -like process . For example, a high concentration of Fe2+ is 
required and a large amount of iron sludge  is generated. In order to solve these problems, 
electro -Fenton and sulfate radical -based electro -Fenton -like processes are developed . Fe2+ 
can be regenerated via cathodic reduction in electro -Fenton and electro -Fenton -like 
processes. Therefore, the Fe2+ concentration used in these processes is much lower than 
that in Fenton and Fenton -like processes. In this paper, electro -Fenton and sulfate 
radical -based electro -Fenton -like processes were used to degrade artific ial sweeteners and 
azo dye s. The removal efficiency, the oxidation mechanism , degradation pathway and 
toxicity evolution of target pollutants were investigated.  
(1) A detailed discussion on the oxidative  degradation of artificial sweetener 
aspartame ( ASP) in acidic aqueous solution containing catalytic  amount of Fe2+ by using 
electro -Fenton  process is reported.  In electro -Fenton process, ASP could be completely 
removed in  a 30 min reaction and the removal of ASP followed pseudo -first-order kinetics.  
The in crease of Fe2+ concentration and applied current to certain extent could increase the 
removal efficiency of ASP, while further increasing the Fe2+ concentration and applied 
current could lead to the decrease of removal efficiency. Absolute rate constant of  IV 
 hydroxylation reaction of ASP was determined as  (5.23  ±  0.02)  ×  109 M–1 S–1. When 
boron -doped diamond (BDD)  electrode was used as anode, ASP could be completely 
mineralized in a 360 min treatment . Short -chain aliphatic acids such as oxalic, oxamic and 
maleic acid were  identified as aliphatic intermediates in the electro -Fenton process . The 
bacteria luminescence inhibition  showed the toxicity of ASP solution increased at the 
beginning of electrolysis, and then it declined until lower t han the untreated ASP solution 
at the end of the reaction.  
(2) The removal of artificial sweetener saccharin (SAC) in aqueous solution by 
electro -Fenton processes was performed. Experiments were carried out in an undivided 
cylindrical glass cell with a carbon -felt cathode and a  DSA,  Pt or boron -doped diamond 
(BDD)  anode. The removal of SAC by electrochemically generated hydroxyl radicals 
followed pseudo -first order kinetics with all the anodes . The absolute rate constant of the 
SAC hydroxylation reaction  was found as (1.85  ±  0.01)  ×  109 M–1 s–1, which was 
determined by using the competition kinetic method. The comparative study of TOC 
removal efficiency during electro -Fenton treatment indicated a higher mineralization rate 
with BDD than Pt anode. Formatio n of oxalic, formic , and maleic acids  were observed  
during electro -Fenton process.  The evolution of toxicity of SAC and/or its reaction 
by-products  based on the V . fischeri bacteria luminescence inhibition was studied.  
(3) The removal of artificial sweetener sucralose  (SUC) in aqueous solution by 
electro -Fenton processes was also performed in this study.  Hydroxyl radical (•OH), a 
highly powerful  oxidizing agent, was generated catalytically via the electrochemically 
assisted Fenton ’s reaction in the bulk and water oxidation on the surface of anode. The 
effect of Fe2+ concentration and applied current on the mineralization of SUC was 
evaluat ed. A higher mineralization rate was obtained with BDD than that of Pt anode . 
Mineralization cu rrent efficiency (MCE) was calculated and better mineralization current 
efficiency was achieved at relatively short electrolysis time and low applied current. The 
concentration of the formed carboxylic acids and released inorganic ion was monitored by 
ion-exlusion chromatography and ion chromatography (IC). The toxicity  of SUC and/or 
its reaction by -products  was investigated  based on the V . fischeri bacteria luminescence 
inhibition . V 
 (4) The removal of Orange II by a novel electro/α -FeOOH/peroxydisulfate process 
is reported in this study. In electro/α -FeOOH/peroxydisulfate process , sulfate radicals 
were generated by activating peroxydisulfate (PDS) with goethite (α -FeOOH). When 
combined with electrochemical process, the Fe(III) on the surface of α -FeOOH co nverts 
to Fe(II) by cathodic reduction. The effect of initial pH  on the decolorization of Orange II 
was investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box -Behnken 
statistical experiment design (BBD) was applied to analyze the experimental variab les. 
The positive and negative effects on the decolorization of Orange II were determined. The 
response surface methodology models were derived based on the results of the 
pseudo -first-order decolorization  rate constant and the response surface plots were 
developed accordingly.  The results indicated that the applied current showed a positive 
effect on the decolorization  rate constant  of Orange II. The interaction of α-FeOOH 
dosage and PDS concentration was significant. The ANOV A results confirmed that the 
proposed models were accurate and re liable for the analysis of the var iables of 
EC/α-FeOOH/PDS process.  
 (5) The decolorization  of Orange II  in aqueous solution by magnetite (Fe 3O4) 
activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) oxidation in an electrochemical reactor (EC /Fe 3O4/PDS 
process) was performed in this study. Various parameters were investigated to optimize 
the process, including initial pH, current density, PDS concentration and Fe 3O4 dosage. 
The stability of Fe 3O4 particles was observed by recycle experiments. The X -ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to investigate the surface properties of 
Fe3O4 before and after reaction. GC MS analysis was employed to identify the 
intermediate products and a plausible degradation pathway of Orange II  was proposed . 
The change of acute toxicity during the treatment was investigated by activated sludge 
inhibition test. The TOC removal efficiency was 30.0% in a 90 min treatment .

 1.1 Background  
Water quality and availability is a challenging problem facing our society all over 
the world (Rivas et al. 2009 ; Bernal -Martí nez et al. 2010 ). In recent years, more and 
more organic contaminants from contaminated soil, agricultural runoff, industrial 
wastewater and hazardous compounds storage leakage are detected in wastewater, 
surface water and ground water. The presence of these organic compou nds in water 
poses serious threat to public health since most of them are toxic, endocrine disrupting, 
mutagenic or potentially carcinogenic to humans, animals and aquatic life in general 
(Babuponnusami and Mut hukumar 2014 ). Many organic pollutants are considered as 
toxic and detrimental even when present at very low concentrations.  Moreover, many 
organic contaminants cannot be eliminated by conventional physical separation methods 
or cannot be degraded by bi ological processes due to the recalcitrant nature of the 
pollutants present (Pé rez et al. 2002 ). Therefore, more powerful wastewater treatment 
methods  are required . 
Advance oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proved to be effective for the 
degradation of many toxic/persistent organic contaminants from aqueous medium  such 
as coloring matters, pesticides, artificial sweeteners and pharmaceuticals and per sonal 
care products (Kim and Tanaka 2009 ; Wang et al. 2012 ; Calza et al. 2013 ; Janin et al. 
2013 ; El-Ghenymy et al . 2014 ; Rodrigo et al . 2014 ; Wang et al . 2014 ). Moreover, 
AOPs have been successfully used as pretreatment methods to reduce the concentration 
of toxic organic compounds that recalcitrant to biological wastewater treatments 
(Stasinak is 2008 ). AOPs are based on the in -situ generation of hydroxyl radical (•OH, 
E0(•OH/H 2O)= 2.80 V /SHE ) (Evgenidou et al . 2007 ; Salazar et al . 2013 ; Otura n and 
Aaron, 2014) , which is the second strongest oxidizing agent after fluorine (Mousset et 
al. 2014a ). AOPs are especially efficient for degrading aromatic molecules due to the 
electrophilic aromatic substitution of hydroxyl radical which then lead to the opening of 
the aromatic ring (Brillas et al. 2009 ; Mousset et al. 2014b ). The most commonly used 
AOPs for the removal of organic pollutants from water is based on the Fenton’s reagent 
(an aqueous mixture of Fe2+ and H 2O2 that produces hydroxyl radicals)  3 
 (Babuponnusami and Muthukumar 2012 ; Basturk and Karatas 2014 ). It has been used 
as an attractive and effective technology  for the degradation of various organic 
pollutants (Hermosilla et al . 2009a ; Hermosilla et al . 2009b ; Zazo et al . 2009 ; 
Hermosilla et al . 2012 ) because of the lack of toxicity of the reagents, eventually 
leaving no residues and the simplicity of the technology (Sun et al. 2007 ; Nidheesh and 
Gandhimathi 2012 ). However, the conventional Fenton process  has the disadvantages of 
requirement of high Fe2+ concentration and the formation of Fe sludge which limit its 
application (Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2012 ).  
Electro -Fenton process, in which H 2O2 is produced electrochemically and Fe2+ can 
be regenerated throughout t he process, overcomes these disadvantages of conventional 
Fenton process. Compared to the conventional Fenton process, the electro -Fenton 
process has the advantage of regeneration of Fe2+ and avoiding the storing and transport 
of the H 2O2. Moreover, electricity as a clean energy source is used in the process, so the 
overall process does not create secondary pollutants (Jiang and Zhang 2007 ; Brillas et al. 
2009 ). The electro -Fenton  process has been successfully applied in wastewater 
treatment and the process efficiency has been experimentally confirmed by different 
authors for the treatment of media containing pesticides (Oturan et al . 2009 ; Yatmaz 
and Uz man 2009 ; Abdessalem et al. 2010 ), herbicides (Kaichouh et al. 2004 ; Da Pozzo 
et al. 2005 ; Garcí a et al. 2014 ), synthetic dyes (Cruz-Gonzá lez et al. 2010 ; Ghoneim et 
al. 2011 ; Kourdali et al. 2014 ), pharmaceticals (El-Ghenymy et al . 2013 ; Feng et al . 
2014 ; Yahya et al. 2014 ), and so on.  
As a strong oxidant, persulfate (PS) is another popular reagent in the wastewater 
treatment because it is more stable than H2O2 and it can be transported over a long 
distance without alteration. Similar to the conventional Fenton process, PS can be 
activated by transition metals to generate sulfate radicals ( SO 4•–), which have a high 
standard redox potential ( E0 = 2.6 V/SHE) (Shukla et al. 2010 ; Deng and Ezyske 2011 ) 
and can oxidize organic compounds  into small molecules and car bon dioxide (Gayathri 
et al . 2010 ). This process is also named Fenton -like process (Fernandez et al . 2003 ; 
Fernandez et al. 2004 ).  
Like conventional Fenton process, Fe2+ is hard to be regenerated after conversion 4 
 to Fe3+ in sulfate radical -based Fenton -like process, thus high concentration of Fe2+ is 
required  and a la rge amount of iron sludge is produced. In order to solve this problem, 
electrochemical (EC) technology was combined with Fenton -like process 
(electro -Fenton -like process) and used to treat  herbicide 2,4,5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic 
acid (2,4,5 -T) (Wang and Chu 2011 ), azo dye Orange II (Wu et al. 2012 ), bisphenol A 
(BPA) (Lin et al . 2013), clofibric acid (CA) (Lin et al . 2014 ) and landfill leachate 
(Zhang et al. 2014 ). However, the electro -Fenton -like processes mentioned above are all 
homogeneous oxidation processes. The removal of metal ions from the effluent requires 
additional separation and disposal (Zhong et al. 2011 ). Therefore, various kinds of solid 
catalysts inst ead of solu ble m etal ions have received muc h attention. Compared with 
soluble metal ions, solid cata lyst can be re covered and reus ed without being lost along 
with the effluent. As a result, d ifferent kinds of iron metal oxides (such as magnetite and 
goethite) are employed  in the electro -Fenton -like process in this study.  
In this work, electro -Fenton and electro -Fenton -like processes in the presence of 
different oxidants and catalysts were studied. As an emerging contaminant, artificial 
sweeteners are an essential part of f ood technology as a group of discrete chemical 
substances that possess intense sweetness. Synthetic  dyes are one of the most common 
toxic pollutants in the natural environment around the world. These two types of organic 
compounds were selected as model pollutants in this thesis work.  
1.2 Research goals and objective  
The objective of this work was to study the removal of target pollutants from water 
using electro -Fenton and electro -Fenton -like processes. The optimal oxidation 
conditions were identified and the oxidation mechanisms were examined. To meet these 
goals, th e following specific objectives were defined:  
1. Conduct experiments to investigate the effect of the operation parameters on the 
degradation and mineralization of artificial sweetener aspartame (ASP) by 
electro -Fenton process. The concentration of inorgan ic ions and carboxylic acid 
released during the treatment was monitored.  5 
 2. Conduct experiments to investigate the degradation and mineralization of 
artificial sweetener saccharin (SAC) using electro -Fenton process. The comparison 
among different anode mat erials on the degradation and mineralization was investigated. 
Moreover, the toxicity of SAC and its byproducts during electro -Fenton process was 
determined.  
3. Conduct experiment to investigate the mineralization of artificial sweetener 
sucralose (SUC) using electro -Fenton process. The influence of the operation 
parameters on the mineralization of SUC was investigated. The Mineralization current 
efficiency (MCE) was calculated to evaluate the mineralization capacity.  
4. Fe2+ was replaced by goethite to ac tivate PS and degrade d azo dye Orange II  in 
sulfate radical -based electro -Fenton -like process. The response surface methodology 
models were derived based on the results of the pseudo -first-order decolorization  rate 
constant and the response surface plots w ere developed accordingly.  
5. Magnetite was used as heterogeneous catalyst to degrade Orange II  in sulfate 
radical -based electro -Fenton -like process. The surface properties of Fe 3O4 before and 
after reaction were investigated. The intermediates of Orange II during the treatment 
were identified and a plausible degradation pathway was proposed. The change of acute 
toxicity during the treatment was investigated.  
1.3 Structure of the thesis  
 This dissertation is composed of eight chapters.  
 Chapter 1 is an int roduction, including background information of electro -Fenton 
and electro -Fenton -like processes and the chosen organic pollutants, research objectives 
and organization of this thesis.  
 Chapter 2 presents a review of recent work related to this study. Four parts are 
described:  
2.1 Artificial sweeteners  
2.2 Synthetic  dyes 
2.3 Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)  6 
 2.4 Iron metal oxides application in AOPs  
The following three chapters are the presentation of experiments results related to 
electro -Fenton process.  
 Chapter 3 is entitled ― Treatment of aspartame in aqueous solution by electro -Fenton 
process ‖. The removal of ASP in electro -Fenton process was investigated. The effect of 
Fe2+ concentration and applied current on the degradation and mineralization of ASP 
was evaluated. The absolute rate constant for the reaction between ASP and •OH was 
determined by using the competition kinetic method . The concentration of the formed 
carboxylic acids and released inorganic ion was monitored by ion -exclusion 
chromatography  and ion chromatography (IC). The toxicity of ASP and/or its reaction 
byproducts  was studied based on the V . fischeri bacteria luminescence inhibition.  
 Chapter 4 is entitled ― Treatment of saccharin (SAC)  in aqueous solution by 
electro -Fenton process ‖. The removal of artificial sweeteners saccharin (SAC) in 
aqueous solution by electro -Fenton processes was performed in this study. Different 
anode materials on the removal and mineralization of SAC were tested. The absolute 
rate constant of the SAC hydroxyl ation reaction was determined. The evolution of 
carboxylic acids was determined by ion-exchange chromatography. The evolution of 
toxicity of SAC and/or its reaction byproducts  based on the V . fischeri bacteria 
luminescence inhibition was studied.  
 Chapter 5 is entitled ― Treatment of sucralose (SUC) in aqueous solution by 
electro -Fenton process ‖. The removal of artificial sweeteners SUC  in aqueous solution 
by electro -Fenton processes was carried out in this study. The effect of Fe2+ 
concentration and applied current on the mineralization of SUC was evaluated. The 
concentration of the formed carboxylic acids and released inorganic ion was monitored 
by ion -exchange chromatography and ion chromatography. The toxicity of SUC  and/or 
its reaction byproducts  was investigated based on the V . fischeri bacteria luminescence 
inhibition.  
 The following two chapters are the parts devoted to the experiments results of 
electro -Fenton -like process.  
 Chapter 6 is entitled ― Decolorization of Orange II  in water by 7 
 electro/ α-FeOOH /PDS process ‖. In this section, the removal of Orange II  by 
electro/α -FeOOH/peroxydisulfate process was investigated. Response surface 
methodology (RSM) based on Box -Behnken statistical experiment design (BBD) was 
applied to analyze the experimental variables. The positive and negative effects on the 
decolorization of Orange II  were determined. The response surface method ology 
models were derived based on the results of the pseudo -first-order decolorization  rate 
constant and the response surface plots were developed accordingly.  
 Chapter 7 is entitled ―Decolorization of Orange II  in water by electro/Fe 3O4/PDS 
process‖. In this chapter, the decolorization  of Orange II  was performed in aqueous 
solution by Fe 3O4 activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) oxidation in an electrochemical 
reactor (EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process) was performed. Various parameters were investigated 
to optimize the proc ess. The surface properties of Fe 3O4 before and after reaction was 
investigate. The intermediates of Orange II  during the treatment were identified and the 
degradation pathway was proposed. The change of acute toxicity during the treatment 
was investigated .  
Finally, the thesis manuscript ends with Chapter 8 entitled "General conclusions and 
pespectives" .

 2.1 Artificial sweeteners  
Artificial sweeteners are one of the most important and interesting classes of 
emerging contaminants.  Artificial sweeteners have been classified as nutritive and 
non-nutritive depending on whether they are a source of calories  (Whitehouse et al . 
2008 ). The nutritive sweeteners include the mono saccharide polyols (e.g. sorbitol, 
mannitol, and xylitol) and the disaccharide polyols (e.g. maltitol an d lactitol). They are 
approximately equivalent to sucrose in sweetness (Dills Jr 1989 ). The non -nutritive 
sweeteners, better known as artificial sweeteners, include substances from several 
different chemical classes that interact with taste receptors and typically exceed the 
sweetness of sucr ose by a factor of 30 to 13,000 times  (Whitehouse et al. 2008 ). The 
most popular artificial sweeteners are aspartame (ASP), saccharin (SAC), sucralose 
(SUC) and acesulfame. The chemical structure and main characteristics of these 
commonly used artificial sweeteners  were presented in Table 2-1.  
Artificial sweeteners are water contaminants that are highly specific to wastewater. 
Different from other emerging trace contaminants, su ch as pharmaceuticals and personal 
care products (PPCPs), artificial sweeteners have been considered in environmental 
sciences only recently (Loos et al . 2009 ; Mead et al . 2009 ; Richardson 2010 ; 
Richardson and Ternes 2011 ; Lange et al. 2012 ). Excretion after human consumption is 
one of the major source of artificial sweeteners in the environment (Kokotou et al . 
2012 ). The artificial sweeteners can also enter into wastewater treatment plants fr om 
households and industries and they eventually reside in the receiving environmental 
bodies from effluents (Houtman 2010 ).

 Artificial sweeteners are extensively tested for potential adverse health effects on 
humans because they are used as food additives (Schiffman and Gatlin 1993 ; Kroger et 
al. 2006 ; En Humanos and Revisió n 2009 ). Although the measured concentrations of 
some artificial sweeteners range up to microgram per liter levels in surface water, 
groundwater and drinking water, there is a huge safety margin regarding potential 
adverse health effects (Lange et al . 2012 ). Acceptable daily intake value of artificial 
sweeteners is 5 mg/kg of body weight per day and are thus three to four orders of 
magnitude above the maximum possible daily human intake by drinking water. Adverse 
human health effects for the application of artificial sweeteners have been reported in 
several studies (Lange et al . 2012 ; Toth et al . 2012 ). The long -term health effects 
resulting from the chronic exposure to low levels of these compounds are largely 
unknown (Mawhinney et al. 2011 ). 
2.1.1 Aspartame  
Aspartame, the best known of the various artificial sweeteners, is a dipeptide 
methyl ester (Table. l), namely N -L-α-aspartyl -L-phenylalanine methyl ester. It was 
discovered by J. Schlatter in 1965 and commercialized by Searle & Co. under the brand 
name NutrasweetTM (Galletti et al. 1995 ). As the ―first generation‖ sweeteners (Berset 
and Ochsenbein 2012 ), ASP is a white dipeptide, crystalline, low -caloric sweetener, 
which is 180 -200 times sweeter than sucrose (Conceiç ã o et al. 2005 ). ASP is relatively 
stable in its dry form. When pH below 3.0, it is unstable and is hydrolyzed to 
aspartylphe nylalanine. Above pH 6.0, it is transformed to 
5-benzyl -3,6-dioxo -2-piperazine acetic acid (Sardesai and Waldshan 1991 ; Kokotou et 
al. 2012 ). ASP was found in all of the surface waters at a concentration up to 0.21 mg/L 
in Tianjin, China (Gan et al. 2013 ). The risks of ASP ingestion would be in the toxicity 
of its metabolism products. One of its metabolites is methanol which can cause acidoses 
and blindness (Conceiç ã o et al. 2005 ). ASP was rarely degraded by AOPs and it was 
treated by electro -Fenton process for the first time in this study.  17 
 2.1.2 Saccharin  
Saccharin (SAC), one of the ―first generation‖ artificial  sweeteners, was discovered 
accidentally by Fahlberg and Remsen at Johns Hopkins University in 1879  when they 
were studying the oxidation of o-toluene -sulfonamides (Bruno et al . 2014 ). SAC is 
about 200 -700 times sweeter than sucrose (Assumpç ã o et al. 2008 ; Lange et al. 2012 ). 
Nowadays SAC  is approved in more than 90 countries and is widely applied in many 
pharmaceutical and dietary products (Filho et al. 2003 ). For example, in the European 
Union (E.U.) SAC is used as an additive in animal feed for piglets, pigs, bovines and 
calves, and it is also the major degradation by -product of certain sulfonylurea herbicides 
(Buerge et al . 2010 ; Kokotou et al . 2012 ). SAC  was slowly absorbed and not 
metabolized by  the human organism, so it is consequently an appropriate artificial 
sweetener for diabetics (Filho et al . 2003 ). SAC has been detected in municipal 
wastewaters and in rivers in many countries, such as Germany, Switzerland and China 
(Gan et al. 2013 ; Van Stempvoort et al. 2011 ). For example, SAC was detected in 
surface waters and ranged from 50 ng/L  to 0.21 mg/L in Tianjin, China (Gan et al. 2013 ). 
It is crucial to find efficient water treat technologies for the removal of SAC from 
aqueous media. In this work, electro -Fenton process was employed to degrade SAC in 
water.  
2.1.3 Sucralose  
Sucralose (S UC)，which is a chlorinated disaccharide derived from sucrose, is one 
of the most popular arti ficial sweeteners and has shown increasing trend of consumption 
(Toth et al. 2012 ). SUC is about 600 times sweeter than the parent molecule, sucrose 
(Grotz and Munro 2009 ; Sharma et al. 2014 ). Nowadays, SUC is approved in more than 
80 countries and is used widely in food products and pharma ceuticals (Sharma et al . 
2014 ). SUC is not metabolized by the human body due to the orientation of the 
glycosidic linkage, and consequently, up to 92% of the consumed SUC is excreted 
unchanged in both urine and feces (Sharma et al. 2014 ; Toth et al. 2012 ). SUC assesses 
potential adverse effects on health, since it provokes symptoms, such as, increase in 18 
 blindness, mineralization of pelvic area and epithelial hyperplasia (Calza et al. 2013 ). 
Nowadays, SUC has been detected in wastewaters and rivers in many countries, such as 
America, France, Italy and China (Calza et al. 2013 ; Gan et al. 2013 ). Recently, SUC is 
considered as an emerging contaminant the by Environmental Prote ction Agency (EPA) 
due to its occurrence in environmental waters and persistence (half -life up to several 
years) (Richardson 2011 ; Richardson and Ternes 2011 ; Calza et al . 2013 ). 
Unfortunately, SUC is hard to degrade by conventional wastewater treatments processes 
(Labare and Alexander 1994 ; Torres et al. 2011 ; Sharma et al. 2014 ). It is crucial to find 
more powerful water treat technologies for the removal of SUC from polluted effluents.  
Different AOPs have been employed to remove SUC from water, including 
ozonation (Scheurer et al. 2010 ; Soh et al. 2011 ), ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (Soh et al. 
2011 ), UV/H 2O2 photooxidation (Keen and Linden 2013 ), photo -Fenton process (Calza 
et al. 2013 ) and TiO 2 photocatalysis process (Calza et al. 2013 ). When treated by 100 
μM ozone, 6% SUC remained after 60 min (Soh et al. 2011 ). Since SUC does not have 
any evident sites for  direct oxidation by ozone, the removal of SUC was mainly caused 
by hydroxyl radicals generated in the oxidative system (Soh et al. 2011 ; Sharma et al. 
2014 ). In a photochemical reactor, SUC did not degrade after 5 h UV exposure (Soh et 
al. 2011 ) and it also did not decay significantly when UV light irradiation lasted for 24 
h (Torres et al . 2011 ), because SUC has low molar extinction coefficient in the UV 
region (Sharma et al . 2014 ). When H2O2 was added to UV irradiation system, the 
removal of SUC was accelerated and 500 μg/L SUC could be almost totally removed 
when U V fluence was 4000 mJ/cm2 (Keen and Linden 2013 ). When photo -Fenton and 
TiO 2 photocatalysis processes were introduced to treat SUC, the removal efficiency of 
15 mg/L SUC were 97.1% and 88.9%, respectively (Calza et al . 2013 ). SUC was 
removed from aqueous media by electro -Fenton process for the first time in this study.  
2.2 Synthetic  dyes  
 Nowadays, there has been an increasing use of synthetic dyes in a large amount of 
industrial areas such as the textile, leather goods, pharmaceutical industry, food industry 19 
 and other chemical usages (Forgacs et al . 2004 ; Hai et al . 2007 ; Soon and Hameed 
2011 ). In 1856, the world’s first commercially synthetic dye was discovered 
accidentally by William Henry Perki n (Saratale et al. 2011 ). Such dyes are defined as 
colored substances which can give fibers a permanent color. This color is able to resist 
fading upon exposure to sweat, light, water and many chemicals,  including oxidizing 
agents and microbial attack (Rai et al . 2005 ). More than ten thousand commercially 
available dyes were developed and used in manufacturing by the end of the 19th century 
(Robinson et al . 2001 ). The gr owth of the worldwide textile industry has been 
accompanied by a rise in pollution due to wastewater contaminated with dyestuff 
(Parikh and Madamwar 2005 ). The water consumption and the wastewater generation 
from the textile industry (dry processing mill and woven fabric finishing mills) depend 
on the processing operations employed during the conversion of fiber to textile fabric 
(Dhanve et al . 2008 ). The textile industry is one of the greatest generators of liquid 
effluent pollutants which attributed to the high quantities of water used in the dyeing 
processes. Moreover, the processing stages and types of synthetic dyes applied dur ing 
this conversion determine the variable wastewater characteristics in terms of pH, 
dissolved oxygen, organic and inorganic chemical content (Banat et al . 1996 ). It is 
estimated that over  7 ×  105 tons of textile dyes are discharged in such industrial 
effluents every year (Robinson et al. 2001 ; Brillas and Martí nez -Huitle 2015 ).  
Dyes can be classified as Acid, Basic, Direct, Vat, Sulfur, Reactive, Disperse, metal 
complexes,  etc., including antraquinone, indigoide, triphenylmethyl, xanthene and 
phthalocyanine derivatives (Martí nez -Huitle and Brillas 2009 ; Brillas and 
Martí nez -Huitle 2015 ). Among these dyes, azo dyes, which are characterized by one or 
two azo -bonds ( –N=N –), account for over 70% of all dyestuffs used worldwide (Salazar 
et al . 2012 , Saratale et al. 2011 ; Brillas and Martí nez -Huitle 2015 ), making them the 
largest group of synthetic colorants and the most common synthetic dyes released into 
the environment (Chang et al . 2001 ; Zhao and Hardin 2007 ; Saratale et al. 2009 ). 
Inappropriate disposal of these dyes contaminated waters consistently would result in an 
even widely contaminated range of environmental matrixes, including surface, ground, 
drinki ng water, and soils. Unfortunately, due to the characteristic of biological 20 
 resistance and chemical stability, azo dyes  can hardly be treated using classical 
wastewater treatments (Ganesh et al . 1994 ; Razo -Flores et al. 1997 ). For this reason, 
many studies have been focused mainly on the remov al of azo dyes from waters (Shu 
and Chang 2005 ; Lucas and Peres 2006 ; Habibi and Talebian 2007 ; Migliorini et al . 
2011 ; Yu et al. 2013 ).  
2.3 Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in dye removal  
 Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been precisely defined as ―near 
ambient temperature  and pressure water treatment processes which involve the 
generation of a powerful oxidizing agent such as hydroxyl radical in solution in 
sufficient quantity to effective water purification‖ by Glaze et al.  at 1987. AOPs mainly 
use chemical, photochemical or electrochemical techniques to generate hydroxyl 
radicals (•OH) which are a highly powerful oxidizing agents ( E0 = 2.80 V /SHE ) and can 
bring about chemical degradation of organic pollutants (Zhang et al. 2007 ; Mollah et al. 
2010 ). •OH is a non -selective and efficient oxidizing agent. It r eadily attacks a large 
number of organic chemicals and converts them to less complex and less harmful 
intermediate products. At sufficient contact time and proper operation conditions, it is 
practically possible to mineralize the target pollutant to CO 2 and H 2O, which are the 
most stable end -product of chemical oxidation (Ayoub et al. 2010 ). The advantage of 
AOPs overall chemical and biological processes is that they are ―environmental -friendly‖ 
as they neither transfer pollutants from phase to the other (as in chemical precipitation, 
adsorption, and volatilization) nor produce massive amoun ts of hazardous sludge (Ince 
and Apikyan 2000 ). AOPs are considered as the promising processes for the wastewater 
treatment in 21st century (Munter 2001 ). 
2.3.1 Fenton process  
 The Fenton’s chemistry star ted as early as the end of the nineteenth century, when 
Henry J. Fenton reported that H 2O2 could be activated by Fe(II) salts to oxidize tartaric 
acid (Fenton 1894 ). In a century since then, Fenton and related reactions have become 21 
 of great interest for their relevance to biological chemistry, synthesis and  the chemistry 
of natural waters (Pignatello et al. 2006 ). In the 1930s, Haber and Weiss showed that the 
catalytic decomposition of H 2O2 by iron salts obeyed to a complex radical and chain 
mechanism (Haber and Weiss 1934 ). Since then, interests in Fenton process has been 
definitely renewed, and Fenton’s reagent was applied to oxidize toxic organics 
originally appeared in the mid -1960s (Brillas et al. 2009 ).  
The generally accepted mechanism of the Fenton process proposes that hydroxyl 
radic als are produced in accordance with Eq. (2 -1) (Bautista et al . 2008 ; Oturan and 
Aaron 2014 ), while the catalyst is regenerated through Eq. (2 -2), or from the reaction of 
Fe3+ with intermediate organic radicals (Eqs. (2 -3)–(2-4)) (Walling 1975 ; Pignatello et 
al. 2006 ; Bautista et al. 2008 ). However, ferrous ions are consumed more rapidly than 
they are regenerated (Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2012 ), and then high concentration of 
Fe2+ is required in Fenton process.  
Fe2+ + H 2O2 → Fe3+ + OH + •OH    k1 = 76 M1 s1    (2-1) 
Fe3+ + H 2O2 → Fe2+ + HO 2•
 + H+  k2 = 0.001 -0.01 M1 s1  (2-2) 
RH + •OH → R• + H2O           (2-3) 
R• + Fe3+ → R+ + Fe2+           (2-4) 
R+ + OH → ROH            (2-5) 
Nevertheless, a number of competitive reactions can also occur (Eqs (2 -6)–(2-10)), 
which negatively affect the oxidation process (Bautista et al. 2008 ). The HO 2• radical 
formed in Eq. (2 -7) is characterized by a lower oxidization power and, therefore, is 
significantly less reactive towards organic compounds (Rush and Bielski 1985 ; Trapido 
et al. 2009 ; Oturan and Aaron 2014 ). 
Fe2+ + •OH → Fe3+ + OH   k3 = 3.20 ×  108 M1 s1  (2-6) 
H2O2 + •OH → HO 2•
 + H 2O   k4 = 2.70 ×  107 M1 s1  (2-7) 
Fe2+ + HO 2• → Fe3+ + OH   k5 = 1.30 ×  106 M1 s1  (2-8) 
Fe3+ + HO 2• → Fe2+ + O 2 + H+  k6 = 1.20 ×  106 M1 s1  (2-9) 
•OH + •OH → H 2O2               k7 = 5.20 ×  109 M1 s1  (2-10) 
Basically, the Fenton process possesses some important advantages for wastewater 22 
 treatment, such as easy implementation in existing plants, easy -to-handle and relatively 
inexpensive chemicals, no need for energy input, and so on (Bautista et al. 2008 ; Oturan 
and Aaron 2014 ). It has been employed to degrade various kinds of organic pollutants in 
water, for example, dyes (Muruganandham and Swa minathan 2004 ; Sun et al . 2009 ), 
landfill leachate (Deng and Englehardt 2006 ; Hermosilla et al . 2009 ) and phenol 
(Kavitha and Palanivelu 2004 ; Zazo et al. 2005 ). 
However,  Fenton process has some disadvantages which limit its application. 
Firstly, high concentration of Fe2+ is required and large amount of Fe sludge is formed 
(Chou et al . 1999 ). The treatment of the sludge -containing Fe ions at the end of the 
wastewater treatment is expensive and needs large amount of chemicals and manpower 
(Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2012 ). Sec ondly, Fenton’s reaction is limited by a narrow 
pH range (pH 2.5 –3.5) because iron ions will be precipitated at higher pH values 
(Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2012 ). Thirdly, as a liquid solution, the storing and 
transport of H2O2 are difficult. In  order to solve these problems, Electrochemical 
advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) based on Fenton’s reaction was developed.  
 
2.3.2 Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Processes (EAOPs) based on Fenton’s 
reaction  
2.3.2.1 Fundamentals and categories  
The electrochemical (EC) technology which based on the transfer of electrons, 
have received great attention for the prevention of pollution problems (Brillas et al . 
2009 ; Oturan and Aaron 2014 ). The main advantage of EC technology is its 
environmental compatibility since the main reagent, electron, is a clean reagent. A large 
variety of EAOPs were developed by combining EC technology with AOPs in the last 
decade due to  their environmental safety and compatibility (operating at mild 
conditions), versatility, high efficiency, and possibility of automation (Oturan and 
Aaron 2014 ). Among all the EAOPs, EAOPs based on Fenton’s reaction chemistry are 23 
 eco-friendly methods and avoid some disadvantages in conventional Fenton process that 
have recently attracted great attention for water remediation (Nidheesh and 
Gandhimathi 2012 ). EAOPs based on Fenton’s reaction chemistry can be generally 
divided into three catego ries.  
The first one is electro -Fenton process. H 2O2 is formed by the reduction of the 
dissolved oxygen on the cathode surface (Eq. (2 -11)) in an electrolytic cell. H 2O2 can 
then react with the externally added catalyst (Fe2+ or Fe3+) to produce •OH (Eq. ( 2-1)). 
Moreover, Fe2+ which consumed in Fenton’s reaction can be regenerated by cathodic 
reduction (Eq. (2 -12)) in electro -Fenton process which reduces the required 
concentration of initial Fe2+ to an catalytic amount (Figure 2 -1a). 
O2 + 2H+ + 2e → H 2O2            (2-11) 
Fe3+ + e → Fe2+              (2-12) 
Electro -Fenton process solves some problems existed in Fenton process. For example, 
higher degradation rate of organic pollutants is obtained because of the continuous 
regeneration  of Fe2+ at the cathode  and the on -site production of H 2O2 avoids its 
dangerous transport  and storage  (Martí nez -Huitle and Brillas 2009 ) and avoiding also 
the competition of wasting reactions (2 -6), (2 -7) and (2 -10) (Oturan and Aaron 2014, 
Siré s et al. 2014).  
The reporting cathod e materials favored the electrogeneration of H 2O2 were gas 
diffusion electrodes (GDEs) (Brillas et al. 1998 ; Panizza and Cerisola 2009 ; Barros et al. 
2014 ; Yu et al . 2015 ), graphite (Yuan and Lu 2005 ; Yuan et al . 2006 ) and 
three -dimensional electrodes such as carbon -felt (Pimentel et al . 2008 ; Diagne et al . 
2014 ; Olvera -Vargas et al. 2014 ), activated carbon fiber (ACF) (Wang et al. 2005 ; Lei et 
al. 2010 ; Wang et al . 2010a ), reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) (Xie and Li 2006 ; 
Martí nez and Bahena 2009 ) and carbon sponge (Özcan et al . 2008 ). Among these 
cathode materials, carbon -felt has a high specific surface that favors the fast generation 
of Fenton’s reagent (H 2O2 and Fe2+) and has applied widely (Brillas et al. 2009 ). The 
commonly used anode materials in electro -Fenton process were high oxygen 
overvoltage anodes (M), such as PbO 2, dimensionally stable anodes (DSA), Pt  and 
boron -doped diamond (BDD) anode. Organic pollutants can also be destroyed by 24 
 heterogeneous hydroxyl radicals M(•OH) electro -generated on high oxygen overvoltage 
anodes (Eq. (2 -13)).  
M (H 2O) → M (•OH) + H+ + e        (2-13) 
Dirany et al . 2012   treated antibiotics sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) in aqueous 
solution using electro -Fenton process. When the applied current was 300 mA, the initial  
pH of 0.21 mM SCP solution was fixed at  3.0, SCP could be totally removed in 10 min. 
The mineralization efficiency of SCP was nearly 100% in a 360 min reaction (Table 
2-2). 
The second category is Fered -Fenton process or EF -Fere process. Both 
components of Fenton’s reagent (H 2O2 and Fe2+) are added externally to the reactor. Fe3+ 
which formed i n the Fenton’s reaction can convert to Fe2+ via cathodic reduction (Eq. 
(2-12)) (Figure 2 -1b). Zhang et al . 2007 degraded 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP) in water by 
using Fered -Fenton process. The COD removal efficiency for 200 mg/L 4 -NP was 70% 
in a 120 min reactio n, while the COD removal efficiency was only 50% in Fenton 
process at the same concentration of Fenton’s reagent (H 2O2 and Fe2+) (Table 2 -2).  
The third category is electrochemical peroxidation process. A sacrificial iron anode 
was used for Fe2+ electrogeneration from anodic dissolution via Eq. (2 -14). H 2O2 is 
externally added to the treated solution to degrade the organic pollutants with •OH from 
Fenton’s reaction (Figure 2 -1c). In electrochemical peroxidation process, the 
coagulation of Fe(OH) 3 precipitate formed depending on the pH and the applied current 
can be an significant alternative route for the degradation of organic pollutants (Brillas 
et al. 2009 ).  
Fe → Fe2+ + 2e             (2-14) 
Electrochemical peroxidation process was employed to treat hexachlorbenzene (HCB) 
in aqueous solution by Xie et al (Xie et al. 2005 ). 96.96% of the initial HCB could be 
removed in 3 h (Table 2 -2).

2.3.2.2 Reactors for EAOPs based Fenton’s reaction   
Generally,  the reactors in which EAOPs based Fenton’s reaction  were carried out 26 
 can be divided into two categories, i.e., the undivided cells and divided cells. Majority 
of researches were carried out in undivided electrochemical cells (Brillas et al. 1998 ; 
Mansour et al . 2015 ; Thirugnanasambandham et al . 2015 ; Zhang et al . 2015a ). The 
major advantage of using undivided cells is that the electrolysis requires lower cell 
voltage because the voltage penalty of the separator of divided cells is avoided (Brillas 
et al . 2009 ). Nidheesh et al.  2014  degraded Rhodamine B (RhB) in a 1000 mL 
undivided cylindrical glass cell of 10.4 cm diamet er containing 750 mL RhB solution 
(10 mg/L) by using electro -Fenton process. Two graphite plate with the same 
dimensions (5 ×  5 cm ) were used as anode and cathode. The results indicated RhB can 
be totally removed in a 180 min reaction.  
However,  reactive ox ygen species and other weaker oxidants can also be generated 
at the anode in the undivided cell, which can complicate the electro -Fenton degradation 
process (Brillas et al. 2009 ). Therefore, it is harder to discuss the reaction mechanism in 
an undivided cell. Divided cells, in which cathode and anode are usually separated by 
membrane and salt bridge (Brillas et al. 2009 ) (Figure 2 -2), are conducive to investigate 
the mechanism of cathodic Fenton  process. Yuan et al. 2014  degraded 4 -nitrophenol 
in a divided cell to investigate the mechanism  of electro -Fenton process. Pozzo et al. 
2005 employed an electro chemical  cell divided by a cationic membrane to explore the 
produc tion of hydrogen peroxide through the cathodic reduction of oxygen in acidic 
medium. Saltmiras and Lemley 2002 removed atrazine in a divided cell using anodic 
Fenton process  in which ferrous ions were delivered via a sacrificial iron anode.

exchange membrane (b)  
2.3.2.3 Improvements in electro -Fenton process  
All the reactions mentioned above are homogeneous reactions, which have the 
disadvantages that the removal of metal ions from the effluent requires additional 
separation and disposal (Zhong et al . 2011 ). Therefore, various catalysts have been 
employed for the heterogeneous a ctivation of H 2O2. Garrido -Ramí rez et al. 2013 used 
nanostructured allophane clays supported with iron oxide (AlSi 2Fe6) as irons source of 
Fenton’s reaction to degrade atrazine in water by electro -Fenton process. 46 mM 
Atrazine could be totally removed in 8 h when the initial pH was 3.0. Iglesias et al . 
2014 treated pesticide imidacloprid using a heterogeneous electro -Fenton system with 
ironalginate gel beads (EF -FeAB). The removal efficiency of 100 mg/L imidacloprid 
was 95% in a 120 min reaction.  
2.3.3 Sulfate radical -based Fenton -like process  
In recent years, activated persulfate (PS) oxidation is an emerging AOP for the 
treatment of organic pollutants (Rastogi et al. 2009 ; Tsitonaki et al. 2010 ). PS, which is 
discovered by M. Berthelot in 1878, is a stable oxidants with high aqueous solubility at 
ambient temperature  (Cao et al . 2008 ). The commonly used PS in AOPs is 28 
 peroxydisulfate (PDS, S 2O82, E0 = 2.01 V/SHE) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS, HSO 5, 
E0 = 1.82 V/SHE). PS can be activated by transition metals (Fe2+, Co2+, Ag+, etc.) 
(Romero et al. 2010 ; Zhao et al. 2010 ; Pagano et al. 2012 ; Wang and Chu 2012 ; Long et 
al. 2013 ) to generate sulfate radicals (SO 4•–), which are promising in the treatment of 
organic contaminants in water ( E0 = 2.6 V/SHE) (Shukla et al. 2010 ; Cai et al. 2014 ; 
Wang et al . 2014 ). Transition me tals activated PS process is similar to conventional 
Fenton process, so it also be named as Fenton -like process by Fernandez et al 
(Fernandez et al . 2003 ; Fernandez et al . 2004 ). Compared to other transition meta ls, 
Fe2+ is inexpensive, nontoxic and effective, which has been widely used in cataly tic 
oxidation process (Eq. (2 -15) and (2 -16)) (Wang and Chu 2011b ; Li et al. 2015 ; Zhang 
et al. 2015b ). Moreover, due to its unsymmetrical character, PMS might be more easily 
activated than PDS ( Olmez -Hanci et al 2011).   
S2O82– + Fe2+ → Fe3+ + SO 4•– + SO 42–         (2-15) 
HSO 5– + Fe2+ → Fe3+ + SO 4•– + OH–         (2-16) 
Similar to conventional Fenton process, there are some drawbacks encountered in 
sulfate radical -based Fenton -like process. For example, high ferrous ion dosage is 
required to activate PS due to the hard regeneration of Fe2+. This results in large amount 
of iron sludge (Vicente et al . 2011 ). Like EAOPs based Fenton’s reaction, 
electrochemical process was combined with Fenton -like process and solved these 
problems (electro -Fenton -like process) (Wang and Chu 2011a ; Wu et al. 2012 ). 
In sulfate radical -based electro -Fenton -like process, Fe2+ can be regenerated via 
cathodic reduction (Eq. (2 -12)) of ferric iron ions. In addition, sulfate radicals could be 
produced via an elect ron transfer reaction (Eq. (2 -17) and (2 -18)) (Zhao et al . 2010 ; 
Zhou et al . 2011 ). Therefore, the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants was 
enhanced by coupling EC process and Fe2+ activated PS process.  
S2O82– + e– → SO 4•– + SO 42–          (2-17) 
HSO 5− + e– → SO 4•– + OH−          (2-18) 
According to different producing way of the PS and Fe2+, ele ctro-Fenton -like 
process can be divided into three categories.  
In the first one, an iron electrode was used as anode and provided soluble ferrous 29 
 ions continuously through anodic oxidation (Eq. (2 -14)). Once PS was added into the 
system, sulfate radicals were generated via the catalysis of ferrous ions (Eq. (2 -17) or 
(2-18)) (Figure 2 -3a).  
Wang and Chu 2011a proposed an ―electro -Fe(II)/Oxone (EFO)‖ process to 
degrade 2,4,5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5 -T). The EFO process demonstrated 
high 2,4,5 -T removal efficiency and nearly completed the herbicide degradation within 
10 min. Yua n et al. 2013 employed a similar system to degrade trichloroethylene (TCE). 
Cast gray iron was used as anode and provided  Fe2+, which could activate persulfate to 
generate sulfate radicals. 99% of 0.4 mM TCE could be transformed in a 20 min 
reaction ti me. 
In the second category, both PS and Fe2+ are added externally to the reactor. Fe3+ 
which formed in Eq. (2 -15) and (2 -16) can transform to Fe2+ via cathodic reduction (Eq. 
(2-12)) (Figure 2 -3b). Wu et al.  2012 chose azo dye Orange II as the target pollutant and 
treated it using an ―electro/Fe2+/peroxydisulfate‖ process. 95% of 0.1 mM  Orange II  can 
be removed in a 60 min reaction with electrolyte concentration 0.1 M, Fe2+ 
concentration 1 mM, PDS concentrati on 12 mM, and current density ( j) 16.8 mA/cm2. 
―Electro/Fe2+/peroxydisulfate‖  process was also applied to the treatment of landfill 
leachate by Zhang et al (Zhang et al. 2014 ). When PS concentration was 62.5 mM, Fe2+ 
concentration was 15.6 mM, j was 13.89 mA/cm2 and initial pH 3.0, the COD removed 
by oxidation and coagulation was about 40% and 22%, respectively.  
In the third category, Fe2+ is replaced by Fe3+ and added to the treated solution 
because Fe2+ has the disadvantage of easily oxidized to Fe3+ by air and ferrous solution 
should be stored under an acidic condition. Fe3+ was first reduced to Fe2+ (Eq. (2 -12)) at 
the cathode and then activated PS to generate sulfate radicals. The regeneration of 
ferrous ions was enhanced by cathodic reduction (Eq. (2 -12)) simultaneously (Figure 
2-3c). ―Electro/Fe3+/PDS‖  and ― EC/Fe3+/PMS ‖ processes were used to treat organic 
pollutants in water by our team (Lin et al. 2013 , 2014 ). ―Electro/Fe3+/PDS‖ was used to 
degrade bisphenol A (BPA) which is a known endocrine disrupter and industrial 
chemical (Staples et al. 1998 ; Cleveland et al. 2014 ; Olmez -Hanci et al. 2015 ). BPA 
could be nearly completely removed in a 60  min treatment time with initial BPA 30 
 
concentration of 0.22 mM, Fe3+ concentration of 4 mM, PDS concentration of 20 mM, 
Na2SO 4 concentration of 50 mM, initial pH value of 3.0 and the current density of 33.6 
mA/cm2. The mineralization efficiency reached 94.3% in a 120 min reaction at the same 
condition (Lin et al . 2013 ). Clofibric acid (CA), which is the active metabolite of 
several widely used blood lipid regulators, was treated by ―EC/Fe3+/PMS ‖ process (Lin 
et al. 2014 ). When initial CA concentration was 50 mg/L, PMS concentration fixed at 
20 mM, Fe3+ concentrat ion was 2.00 mM, Na 2SO 4 concentration was 50 mM, initial pH 
was 4.0 and the current density was 33.6 mA/cm2, CA was completely removed after 60 
min reaction.

Figure 2 -3 Schematic representation of different types of electro -Fenton -like processes: (a) The first 
category; (b) The second category; (c) The third category)  
All the electro -Fenton -like processes  mentioned above are homogeneous 
processes. They have the same draw backs as homogeneous  electro -Fenton processes. In 
this study, iron metal oxides were  used to replace Fe2+ and activated PS.  
2.4 Iron oxides applied in AOPs based on Fenton and Fenton -like 
process  
Iron oxides are abundantly available minerals , presenting in  the natural aqueous 
environment as suspended solid particles , and they also suspend in aerosol, clouds and 
fogs as fine particles (Hou et al. 2014 ; Rahim Pouran et al. 2014 ). Recently, iron oxides 31 
 are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis processes and constitute an attractive 
alternatives for the decontamination of soils, underground waters , sediments, and 
industrial effluents because they are natural, abundant, inexpensive, and 
environmentally friendly (Aredes et al. 2012 ; Xu et al. 2012 ; Rahim Pouran et al. 2014 ). 
Nowadays, several iron oxides and modified iron oxides are used to replace Fe2+ in 
AOPs based Fenton and Fenton -like process (He et al. 2005 ; Guo et al. 2010 ; Ji et al. 
2013 ; He et al. 2014 ; Sun et al. 2014 ).  
2.4.1 Goethite ( α-FeOOH ) 
Goethite, an iron oxyhydroxide mineral with chemical formula of α-FeIIIO(OH), is 
a commonly used iron oxide among Fe(III) bearing minerals for heterogeneous Fenton 
and Fenton -like based AOPs due to its ability to operate in a wide range of pH, higher 
stability thermodynamically and being relatively low priced and environmenta lly 
friendly (Ortiz de la Plata et al. 2008 ; Wang et al. 2010b ; Rahim Pouran et al. 2014 ; 
Sable et al. 2015 ). Goethite is also used in electro -Fenton process as a substitute  of Fe2+ 
to react with H 2O2 and form •OH through Fenton’s reaction, avoiding the additional 
water pollution caused by the homogeneous catalyst. Expó sito et al . 2007  applied 
goethite as active heterogeneous catalyst undergo Fenton’s reaction with 
electrogenerated H 2O2 in electro -Fenton process using aniline as the model pollutant. 
When initial aniline concentration was 100 mg/L, α-FeOOH  dosage fixed at 1 g/L, 
Na2SO 4 concentration was kept at 20 mM, initial pH was 3.0 and the applied current 
was 250 mA, the TOC removal efficiency of aniline was about 90% in a 25 h reaction.  
2.4.2 Magnetite (Fe 3O4) 
Magnetite is a spinel iron oxide with chemical formula of (Fe3+)tet[Fe2+Fe3+]octO4 
where Fe3+ cations occupy equally both octahedral and tetrahedral sites and Fe2+ cations 
are placed only in octahedral sites (Rahim Pouran et al . 2014 ). Magnetite has gained 
considerable attention than other iron oxides in AOPs base d Fenton and Fenton -like 
process due to its unique characteristics: (i) The Fe(II) in its structure may play an 32 
 significant role as an electron donor to initiate the Fenton’s reaction (Kwan and V oelker 
2003 ; Moura et al . 2005 ; Hou et al . 2014 ); (ii) The octahedral site in the magnetite 
structure can easily accommoda te both Fe(II) and Fe(III), which means that Fe(II) can 
be reversibly oxidized and reduced in the same structure (Moura et al. 2005 ); (iii) The 
production of more active systems by modification in the physico -chemical properties 
of the magnetite through isostructural substitution of iron by different transition metals 
(Moura et al. 2005 ; Hou et al. 2014 ); (iv) The magnetically easy separation of magnetite 
catalysts from the reaction system as a result of its magnetic property (Ai et al. 2011 ; 
Chun et al. 2012 ) and (v) Higher dissolution rate of magnetite compared to other iron 
oxides which lead to higher electron mobility in its spinel structure (Litter and Blesa 
1992 ; Matta et al. 2008 ).  
Chen et al . 2014 synthesized Fe 3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) by the 
oxidation -precipitation method and investigated their catalytic properties by the 
peroxide oxidation of Orange II solution. After 60 min reaction, the decolorization 
efficiency of Orange II was 99.89% with initial Orange II conc entration of 100 mg/L, 
Fe3O4 NPs dosage of 1.5 g/L, H 2O2 concentration of 22 mM and initial pH value of 2.7. 
Yan et al . 2011 applied iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3O4 MNPs) to activate 
PDS and degrade antibiotics sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) in aqueous solution. When 
initial SMM concentration was 0.06 mM, Fe 3O4 MNPs dosage fixed at 2.40 mM, PDS 
concentration was 1.2 mM and initial pH was 6.8, SMM could be  completely removed 
in a 15 min reaction.

 3.1 Introduction  
In this study, a detailed discussion on the oxidative  degradation of artificial 
sweetener aspartame ( ASP) in acidic aqueous solution containing catalytic  amount of 
Fe2+ by using electro -Fenton  process was reported. The kinetics of ASP degradation by 
•OH generated during electro -Fenton  process has been investigated. The absolute rate 
constant of the  reaction between ASP and •OH was determined by the competition  
kinetic method using benzoic acid as a reference  competitor (Özcan et al. 2009a , Özcan 
et al. 2013 ). The effect of the applied current and Fe2+ concentration  on the degradation 
and mineralization of ASP was examined. The aliphatic short -chain carboxylic acids 
released during electro -Fenton process were monitored. The concentration of inorganic 
ions released into the solution was investigated.  The variation of toxicity of ASP 
solution and its intermediates was assesed by Microtox method.  
3.2 Materials and methods  
3.2.1 Chemicals  
ASP,  N-L-α-aspartyl -L-phenylalanine methyl ester (C 14H18N2O5, ≥98%),  was 
obtained from Alfa Aesar and was used in the electrolytic experiments without further 
purification.  Analytical grade anhydrous so dium sulfate from Sigma -Aldrich was used 
as supporting electrolyte. Ferrous sulfate heptahydrated of analytical grade was 
purchased from Acros Organics and used as catal yst source. Analytical grade benzoic 
acid from Prolabo (R.P. Normapur  grade)  was used as the competition substrate in 
several  kinetic experiments. Analytical grade carboxylic acids and or other chemicals 
used for chromatographic analysis were purchased from Acros, Sigma , Riedel -de Ha ë n 
and Fluka. All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water obtained from a Millipore 
Mill-Q system with resistivity > 18 MΩ cm  at room temperature.  51 
 3.2.2 Procedures and equipment  
Bulk experiments w ere carried out at room temperature in a 250 mL undivided 
cylindrical glass cell of  6 cm diameter containing 220 mL ASP solution. The cathode 
(working) electrode was a 87.5 cm2 piece of carbon felt (17.5 cm ×  4.5  cm, 
Carbon -Lorraine, France) which placed on the inner wall of  the cell covering the totality 
of the internal perimeter. The a node (counter) electrode was a cylindrical Pt mesh (4.5 
cm height, i.d. = 3.1 cm, Platecxis, France) or a 24 cm2 thin-film BDD electrode 
(CONDIAS GmbH, Germany). The anode was centered in the cell, surrounded by the 
carbon felt. Electrolysis was  conducted under constant current conditions using a 
Hameg HM8040 -3 triple power supply (Germany).  
Compressed air was bubbled star ting 5 min  before electrolysis  at about 0.5 L/min 
through the aqueous solutions to saturate aqueous solution before starting electrolysis  
and it is maintained during electrolysis to ensure the continuous saturation of oxygen. 
H2O2 was supplied from the electro -reduction of O 2 dissolved in the solution in all the 
electrolyses.  The degradation experiments were performed using 0.2 mM ASP solut ion 
with 50 mM Na 2SO 4 as supporting electrolyte. A catalytic quantity of ferrous ion was 
added into the solution before the beginning of electrolysis. The initial pH (pH 0) of ASP 
solutions was measured with a CyberScan pH 1500 pH -meter (Eutech Instrument, USA) 
and set at 3.0 ( ±0.1), adjusting by the addition of 1 M sulfuric acid.  
3.2.3 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis  
The initial and residual ASP concentration w as monitored by HPLC, which 
consist s of a Merck Lachrom liquid chromatograph, equipped with a L -2130 pump and 
was fitted with a Purospher RP -18, 5 μm, 25 cm × 4.6 mm ( i.d.) column at 40 C, and 
coupled with a L -2400 UV detector at maximum absorption wavelength of 215 nm for 
ASP. The analysis  was performed using a 70:30 (v/v) water (0.1% acetic acid)/methanol 
(0.1% acetic acid) isocratic solvent mixture as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 
mL/min. The injection volume was 20 μL.  
The short -chain carboxylic acids were identified and quantified by ion -exclusion 52 
 HPLC consisting of a Merck Lachrom liquid chromatograph equipped with a L-7100 
pump, a Supelcogel H column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 9 μm (i.d.) particle size) and a 
L-7455 photodiode array detector at a selected wavelength of 220 nm. 0.1% H 2SO 4 
solution was used as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Calibration curves 
were achieved using standard solutions of related carboxylic acids. The identification of 
the carboxylic acids was performed by the comparison between the retention time ( tR) 
and internal standard addition method using standard solutions.  
3.2.4 Ion chromatography (IC) analysis  
Inorganic ions (NO 3– and NH 4+) released during the treatment were monitored by 
ion chromatography with a Dionex ICS -1000 Basic Ion Chromatography System 
equipped with an IonPac AS4A -SC (anion exchange) and CS12 A (cation exchange) 
250 mm ×  4 mm column and fitted with a DS6 conductivit y detector containing a cell 
heated at 35 C under control through a Chromeleon SE software . The mobile phase 
was a mixture of 3.6 mM Na 2CO 3 and 3.4 mM NaHCO 3 solution for anion -exchange 
column with a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min and 9 mM H 2SO 4 solution for cat ion-exchange 
with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The volume of injections was 25 μL.  
3.2.5 Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis  
The TOC of the initial and electrolyzed samples were determined by Shimatzu 
TOC -VCSH analyser according to the combustion catalytic o xidation method at 680 C. 
The carrier gas was oxygen with a flow rate  of 150 m L/min. Platinum was used as 
catalyst to carry out the combustion at 650 ° C instead of 900 ° C. The injection volume 
was 50 μL. Calibration of the analyser was obtained with potassium hydrogen phthalate 
standards.  
3.2.6 Toxicity measurements  
The evolution of the toxicity of treated solutions  during the treatment was assessed 
by Microtox method according to the international standard process (OIN 11348 -3) 53 
 using a Microtox® mode l 500. This measurements performed with the bio -luminescence 
marine bacteria V . fischeri  (Buerge et al . 2009 ; Buerge et al . 2010 ; Bokare and Choi 
2014 ), provided by Hach Lange France SAS. Two values of the inhibition of the 
luminescence (%) were measured after 5 min and 15 min of exposure to samples at 15 
C. 
 
3.3 Results and discussion  
3.3.1 Eff ect of catalyst concentration on ASP degradation  
A set of electrolysis was carried out with 0.2 mM (58.9 mg/L) ASP in aqueous 
solutions to determine the influence of the main operating parameters on the ASP 
degradation in electro -Fenton process. The result s obtained show that the oxidative 
degradation of ASP by electro -Fenton process fits well with the first -order kinetic model 
and the apparent rate constant values ( kapp) calculated accordingly under different 
operating conditions were given in table 3-1.

The effect of catalyst (Fe2+) concentration in ASP oxidation by electro -Fenton 
process was performed at current -controlled conditions and room temperature with Pt 
and BDD anode, respectively (Fig. 3-1). The Fe2+ concentration was varied in the range 
of 0.050.5 mM in 50 mM Na 2SO 4 solution, at applied current 200 mA and initial pH 
3.0. As can be seen in Fig.  3-1, ASP can be totally removed in a 20 min reaction using 
Pt anode , while it only needs 15 min to  degrade ASP completely with BDD anode. This 
indicated that the use of BDD did lead to the acceleration of the ASP degradation. On 
the one hand, due to the low adsorption ability  of •OH on BDD, the loosely bound 
BDD(•OH) formed at the anode surface (Eq. ( 3-1)) can readily react  with organic 
pollutant, in contrast to the chemisorbed radicals  typically formed at Pt surface which 
limited the oxidation ability of Pt(•OH) (Özcan et al. 2009a ; Dirany et al. 2012 ). On the 
other hand, reactive BDD(•OH) is generated in  much higher quantities  than Pt(•OH) 
when electrolysis is operated at the current within the  water discharge region (Brillas et 
al. 2005 ; Panizza and Cerisola 2005 ; Brillas et al . 2009 ) because of the large O 2 
evolution overvoltage of the former.  
BDD + H 2O → BDD(•OH) + H+ + e        (3-1) 
With both Pt and BDD anode, the removal efficiency and degradation rate of ASP 
increased significantly when Fe2+ concentration increased from 0.05 to 0.2 mM (Fig. 
3-1 and Table 3-1). At higher Fe2+ concentration, a considerable amount of hydroxyl 55 
 radicals would be produced via Fenton ’s reaction . These hydroxyl radicals react with 
ASP immediately, resulting in the increase of ASP degradation rate. However, further 
increasing the Fe2+ concentration to  0.5 mM, ASP removal efficiency and rate constant 
decreased evidently (Fig. 3-1 and Table 3-1). The negative influence of higher Fe2+ 
concentration might be attributed to the role of Fe2+ as scavenger of hydroxyl radicals 
(Eq. ( 3-2)) which takes place with  a large rate constant ( k = 3.20 ×  108 M1 S1 ) (Siré s 
et al. 2007b ; Oturan et al. 2010 ).  
Fe2+ + •OH → Fe3+ + OH         (3-2) 
Therefore , the reaction (3 -2) becomes competitive for OH consumption at higher Fe2+ 
and consequently harms the oxidation of ASP .

3.3.2 Effect of applied current on ASP degradation  
In electro -Fenton process, the applied current is a crucial parameter for the 
operational cost and process efficiency (Özcan et al. 2009a ), because the formation rate 
of H 2O2 (Eq. (3 -4)), the regeneration rate of Fe2+ (Eq. (3 -3)) and consequently the 
generation rate of OH through Fenton's reaction (Eq. (2 -1)) are governed by this 
parameter. The ap plied current governs also the formation rate (Eq. (3 -1)) and the 
amount of heterogeneous hydroxyl radicals BDD(OH) or Pt(OH). Therefore the effect 
of applied current for the treatment of 0.2 mM ASP in electro -Fenton processes using 
Pt/carbon -felt (Fig. 3-2a) and BDD/carbon -felt (Fig. 3-2b) cells was examined by using 
the applied current of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 500 mA.  
As depicted in Fig. 3-2a, the total disappearance of ASP became faster at a higher 
current in Pt/carbon -felt cell. The kapp increased from 0.14 to 0.34 min-1 when the 
applied current increased from 50 to 300 mA (Table 3-1). A higher current can promote  
both the Fe2+ regeneration (Eq. ( 3-3)) and the production of H 2O2 (Eq. ( 3-4)) (Lin et al.

 2014 ). However, further increasing the current to 500 mA  resulted in the decreas e of 
kapp to 0.17 min-1. The decrease in ASP oxidation efficiency at higher current can be 
related to the increase of parasitic reactions, such as H 2 evolution reaction (Eq.(3-5)) 
(Dirany et al. 2012 ). 
Fe3+ + e → Fe2+                   (3-3) 
O2 + 2H+ + 2e → H 2O2            (3-4) 
2H2O + 2e– → H 2 + 2OH–           (3-5) 
When it comes to the BDD/carbon -felt cell, the optimal current for ASP 
degradation was 200 mA  (Fig. 3-2b). Moreover, it can be seen from Fig. 2 that the 
comparatively better performance of BDD was more pronounced at lower current 
intensities. When applied current is higher tha n 200 mA, the positive role of BDD 
favoring generation of •OH was insignificant (Table 3-1). This means the application of 
BDD anode can improve removal efficiency of ASP and reduce energy consumption by 
using lower current intensity. A similar behavior ha s been observed for the degradation 
of sulfachloropyridazine (Dirany et al. 2012 ). At current intensity above 200 mA, the 
removal efficiency decreased. This could due to the increase of side reactions: (i) H 2 
evolution from H 2O reduction (Eq. ( 3-5)). (ii) The 4 -e– reduction of O2 leading  to the 
formation of H2O (Eq. ( 3-6)) which inhibit ed the H 2O2 formation reaction (Eq. ( 3-4)) 
occurring on carbon -felt cathode (Özcan et al . 2009b ). Moreover, the O2 evolution 
reaction was more dominate than •OH on the BDD anode at high applied current (Özcan 
et al. 2009b ). (iii) The formation of weak oxidant species like HO 2• (Eq. ( 3-7)) which 
could react with •OH resulting in the formation of H2O and O 2 (Eq.( 3-8)) (Wu et al . 
2012 ).

 3.3.3 Determination of absolute constants for oxidation of ASP by hydroxyl 
radicals  
The absolute rate constant o f ASP treatment by hydroxyl radicals during 
electro -Fenton process was determined by competition kinetics method. Benzoic acid 
(BA) was selected as standard competitor because the absolute rate constant ( kabs,BA ) of 
the reaction between BA and hydroxyl radicals is well known ( kabs,BA  = 4.30 ×  109 M–1 
s–1) (Özcan et al . 2008 ; Siré s et al . 2007c ; Oturan et al . 2010 ). Experiments were 
performed usi ng Pt anode with 0.1 mM ASP solution, Fe2+ concentration 0.2 mM, 
applied current 50 mA and initial pH 3.0. The absolute rate constant of the oxidation of 
ASP was then calculated according to the Eq. ( 3-9).

Based on Fig. 3 -3, the absolute rate constant for the oxidation reaction of ASP and •OH 
(kabs,ASP ) was then determined as (5.23  ±  0.02)  ×  109 M–1 s–1. This value is closed to that 
reported by Toth et al. 2012  (6.06  ±  0.05)  ×  109 M–1 s–1) who determined the absolute 
rate constant by direct observation of the formation  of the cyclohexadienyl radical 
adduct .

 3.3.4 The effect of catalyst concentration and applied current on ASP 
mineralization  
Fig. 3 -4 shows the influence of Fe2+ concentration on the mineralization of ASP 
solution in terms of TOC abatement under the same conditions of Fig. 3-1.  
For both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cell, the TOC removal efficiency 
decreased as Fe2+ concentration increased from 0.1 to 0.5 mM. With the  increasing Fe2+ 
concentration, the percentage of scavenged hydroxyl radicals from Fe2+ ions increased, 
so th e side reactions between Fe2+ ions and •OH (Eq. ( 3-2)) became more significant 
(Özcan et al. 2008 ). This reaction becomes particularly important at longer treatment 
time because of lower concentration of organic matter in the solution. Furthermore, as 
can be seen from Fig. 3-4, the TOC remov al rate was fast during the first 120 min for all 
the Fe2+ concentration in both cells. After 120 min, the TOC removal values gradually 
decreased and reached a steady state. This is due to the quick d ecomposition of ASP and 
its aromatic derivatives which are more easily oxidizable than the ring opening products 
such as aliphatic acids obtained at longer treatment times (Hammami et al. 2008 ). The 
slower mineralization rate observed  at longer electrolysis times for both Pt and BDD 
anodes can also be attr ibuted to the formation of stable ferro - and/or ferri -complexes 
with carboxylic acids (Oturan et al . 2000 ; Brillas et al . 2003 ; Guivarch et al . 2003 ; 
Hammami et al. 2008 ; Haidar et al. 2013 ).  
Even so, it is evident that the use of BDD anode lead to the acceleration of ASP 
mineralization  (Fig. 3 -4). For example, at the end of the 360 min electrolysis, 84.5% 
and 98.0% of the initial TOC value was removed, in the case of Fe2+ concentration of 
0.1 mM, for Pt and BDD anode, respectively. Moreover, BDD/carbon -felt cell achieved > 
95% mineralization in on ly 240 min at 0.1 mM Fe2+, while 84.5% mineralization 
reached at 360 min for Pt/carbon -felt cell . It can be explained that BDD anode 
contributed to the degradation of all the byproducts, even the most refractory ones 
(Dirany et al . 2012 ) due to the high reactivity of BDD(OH) largely formed at this 
anode.  61

The effect of applied current on the mineralization of ASP solution in terms of 
TOC abatement under the same conditions of Fig. 3-2 was investigated and the results 
were shown in Fig. 3-5. With the raising applied current from 100 to 200 mA, the TOC 
removal efficiency was found to increase from 72.2% to 81.7 % in Pt/carbon -felt cell . 
The TOC removal efficiency increased from 93.1% to 97.5% in BDD/carbon -felt cell at

 the end of 360 min electrolysis  under the same cond itions. Higher applied current lead 
to the higher accumulation of hydroxyl radicals in the bulk, and then a greater 
mineralization efficiency can be achieved because of the simultaneous degradation of 
ASP and its byproducts (Dirany  et al. 2012 ). Further increase in the applied current to 
500 mA, the TOC removal efficiency declined to 71.6% and 93.4% for Pt and BDD 
anode, respectively. In the treatment of ASP , the application of current hig her than 200 
mA would increase the extent of parasitic reactions  (Eq. (3 -5)-(3-8)), leading to the 
decrease of the process efficiency (Mousset et al. 2014 ).

 3.3.5 Identification and evolution of carboxylic acids  
It is well known that the cleavage of the benzenic ring of aromatics can lead to the 
release of short -chain carboxylic acids in electro -Fenton process (Siré s et al . 2007a ; 
Özcan et al. 2009b ; Isarain -Chá vez et al. 2010 ; Dirany et al. 2012 ; El-Ghenymy et al. 
2013 ). The concentratio n of carboxylic acids were monitored by ion -exclusion HPLC  
when 0.2 mM ASP solutions were electrolyzed under the conditions of Fig s. 3-4 and 3-5. 
In this study, oxalic, oxamic  and maleic acid at retention time ( tR) of 8.90, 14.26  and 
11.33  were observed, respectively, in both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cell. 
Among th ese carboxylic acid s, the concentration of maleic acid was detected in trace  
and only exist in the first 10 min in both cells, so changes of maleic acid concentration 
were not shown in Fig. 3-6.  
As shown in Fig. 3 -6, all the carboxylic acids were g enerated at the beginning of 
the electrolysis and followed the accumulation -destruction cycles. A similar behavior 
has been observed for the treatment of other organic products (Özcan et al . 2009b ; 
Dirany et al . 2012 ). Oxalic and oxamic  acids were remained even at the end of the 
electrolysis indicating their lower reactivity with hydroxyl radicals and need much more 
time to destruction (Dirany et al. 2012 ). It also depicted by comparing Fig. 3-6a and Fig. 
3-6b that all the acids were nearly disappeared at the end of electrolysis (360 min) in 
BDD/carbon -felt cell, in agreement with the mineralization results shown in Fig. 3-4b 
and Fig. 3-5b. However, oxalic and ox amic acid were still existed in Pt/carbon -felt cell 
in 360 min reaction, which was corresponding to the residual TOC remaining at the end 
of mineralization treatments (Fig. 3-4a and Fig. 3-5a). 64

3.3.6 Identifica tion and evolution of inorganic ions  
During  the mineralization of ASP, the N atoms were released as inorganic ions 
upon the cleavage of the ASP molecules. The qualitative and quantitative monitoring of 
NO 3– and NH 4+ was performed by the ionic chromatography analysis. The evolution of 
the ions concentration identified during the electro -Fenton process was shown in Fig.

 3-7. The final concentration of NO 3– was much higher with BDD anode, which agrees 
with the faster min eralization mentioned in Fig. 3-4. NO 3– and NH 4+ were formed from 
the beginning of the electrolysis. In Pt/carbon -felt cell, the release of ammonium ions 
was much larger than that of nitrate ions in 240 min reaction, but it decreased to 0.016 
mM after 360  min reaction . The release of NO 3– in Pt/carbon -felt cell increased from 0 
to 0.011 mM. Moreover, Fig. 6a indicated that 0.15 mM oxamic acid was existed in 
Pt/carbon -felt cell at 360 min reaction. At the end of electrolysis, 43.2% of initial 
nitrogen of AS P as NO 3– (6.35% of total), NH 4+ (9.25% of total) and oxamic acid (84.4% 
of total) was quantified. This indicated some other refractory nitrogenated compounds 
are formed in the Pt/carbon -felt cell that account for the remaining TOC at 360 min.  In 
BDD/carbon -felt cell, the concentration of NH 4+ increased to 0.07 mM  in the first 60 
min, and then it decreased to 0.004 mM at 360 min. NO 3– increased persistently from 
the beginning to the end of the reaction and the concentration reached 0.116 mM at 3 60 
min. Since TOC was nearly completely removed in BDD/carbon -felt cell at 360 min 
reaction, the non equilibrating of the nitrogen mass balance c ould be attributed to the 
transformation of nitrogen to other nitrogen species, such as NO 2–, gas N 2 and NH 3 
(Hammami  et al. 2008).

3.3.7 The evolution of solution toxicity with reaction time  
In order to monitor the potential toxicity of ASP and its byproducts, 0.2 mM ASP 
was electrolyzed in the presence of 0.2 mM Fe2+ at 200 mA using Microtox method for 
both Pt and BDD anode. The percentage of bacteria luminescence inhibition  versus the 
electrolysis time was recorded after 5 and 15 min exposure  times of V. fischeri  
luminescent bacteria to  the ASP solutions. In Fig. 3-8, only the curves  obtained after a 
15 min exposure time were presented,  because the curves recorded after a 5 min 
exposure time were  very similar.  
For Pt /carbon -felt cell , the curves of inhibition percentage were charact erized by a 
strong increase of the toxicity at 10 min. This indicated that the formed intermediates of 
ASP at the beginning of the electrolysis, which might mainly contain the cyclic 
compounds, were more toxic than ASP. The percentage of inhibition decreased sharply 
after 10 min, which show ed the decrease of toxic intermediate products. The secondary 
peak which appeared at 120 min was much lower than the primary peak, showing the 
toxicity of secondary intermediates were much lower than the former byproducts, even 
a little lower than the untr eated ASP solution. After 120 min, the inhibition percentage

 decreased slowly to the end of the electrolysis.  
The curves obtained for BDD anode showed an analogous behavior at the 
beginning of the electrolysis as Pt anode. The toxicity increased significantly and 
attained the maximum luminescence inhibition peak at 15 min. The secondary peak 
appeared at 40 min and  showed the secondary intermediates still more toxic than the 
original ASP solution. After 40 min treatment, the percentage of inhibition decreased 
and became stable from 120 min. This might due to the destruction of ASP and its cyclic 
byproducts.

3.4 Conclusions  
Aqueous  solution of 0.2 mM ASP was degraded effectively by electro -Fenton 
process using a carbon -felt cathode and a Pt or BDD anode. Compete removal of ASP 
was attained by both anodes, due to the formation of •OH in the bulk from Fenton 
reaction and at the anode surface from water oxidation. For both anodes, ASP could be 
completely removed in less than 30 min and the ASP concentration decay followed 
pseudo -first-order kinetics. Absolute rate constant of hydroxylation reaction of ASP was 
determined as  (5.23  ±  0.02)  ×  109 M–1 s–1. The use of BDD instead of Pt anode yields a 
faster mineralization rate because of the higher oxidation power of BDD(OH)

 comparing with Pt(OH). Short -chain aliphatic carboxylic acids such as oxalic, oxamic 
and maleic acid were  identified as aliphatic intermediates by ion -exclusion 
chromatography. The bacteria luminescence inhibition  showed the toxicity of ASP 
solution increased at the beginning of electrolysis, and then it declined until lower than 
the untreated ASP  solution at  the end of the reaction.

 4.1 Introduction  
In this part, the effect of different anode materials and different supporting 
electrolyte on the removal of sweetener saccharine (SAC) was investigated  by 
electro -Fenton process . The absolute rate constant of the  reaction between SAC and 
•OH was determined by the competition  kinetic method. The effect of the Fe2+ 
concentration and applied current on the degradation and mineralization of SAC was 
examined. The aliphatic short -chain carboxylic acids released during electro -Fenton 
process were monitored. The variation of toxicity of SAC solution and its intermediates 
was determined by Microtox method.  
4.2 Materials and methods  
4.2.1 Chemicals  
Saccharin  (1,1-dioxo -1,2-benzothiazol -3-one (or o-benzoic sulfimide), 
C7H5CNO 3S) was purchased from Sigma -Alorich . Analytical grade  anhydrous sodium 
sulfate and ferrous sulfate he ptahydrated were obtained from Sigma -Aldrich and Acros 
Organics, respectively. Regent grade benzoic acid was purchased from Problabo (France)  
used as the competition substrate in se veral  kinetic experiments. Analytical grade 
carboxylic acids and other chemicals used for chromatographic analysis were purchased 
from Acros, Merck, Sigma , Riedel -de Ha ë n and Fluka. Ultrapure water used for  the 
preparation of the working solutions and HPLC elut ing solutions  was obtained from a 
Millipore Milli -Q (simplicity 185) system  with resistivity > 18 M Ω cm at room 
temperature.  
4.2.2 Electrochemical apparatus and procedures  
Electrolyses were performed at constant current and room temperature  using a 
Hameg H M8040 -3 triple power supply (Germany) in an open,  cylindrical undivided 
glass cell of 6 cm diameter and 250 mL  capacity containing 220 mL SAC solution . 74 
 Electro -Fenton oxidation was conducted  using three anodes: a cylindrical Pt mesh (4.5 
cm height, i.d. = 3.1 cm, Platecxis, France) , a 25 cm2 thin-film BDD (CONDIAS GmbH, 
Germany)  and a commercial DSA (mixed metal oxide Ti/RuO 2–IrO 2, Baoji Xinyu 
GuangJiDian Limited Liability Company, China). A 87.5 cm2 piece of carbon felt (17.5 
×  5 cm, Carbon -Lorraine, France) was used as cathode.  
In all cases, the anode was centered in the electrolytic cell and was surrounded by 
the cathode that covered the inner wall of the cell. H 2O2 was produced from reduction of 
O2 dissolved in the solution. Cont inuous saturation of O 2 at atmospheric pressure was 
ensured by bubbling compressed air passing through a frit at about  0.5 L/min , starting 5 
min before the beginning of the electrolysis. Prior to the electrolysis,  a catalytic quantity 
of ferrous ion and 50 mM Na 2SO 4 (supporting electrolyte)  were added to the SAC 
solutions with constant stirring by using a magnetic  stirrer (IKA, Germany).  
The pH of initial solutions (pH 0) was set at 3.0 by the addition of 1 M sulfuric 
acid because this value was reported as  the optimal pH value for the electro -Fenton 
processes (Özcan et al . 2008a ). The pH of  SAC solutions was measured with a 
CyberScan pH 1500 pH -meter (Eutech Instrument, USA).  
4.2.3 Analytical methods and procedures  
The concentration of residual SAC w as monitored by high performance liquid 
chromatography ( HPLC), which consist of a Merck Lachrom liquid chromatograph, 
equipped with a L -2130 pump and fitted with a Purospher RP -18, 5 μm, 25 × 4.6 mm 
(i.d.) column at 40 C, and coupled with a L -2400 UV detector at maximum absorption 
wavelength of 218 nm for SAC . The analyses were performed using a phosphoric acid 
(pH 3.0)/methanol (80:20, v/v ) as mobile phase in  isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1.0 
mL/min. The injection vo lume was 20 μL.  
The short -chain carboxylic acids were identified and quantified by ion -exclusion 
HPLC using a L-7100 pump, a Merck Lachrom liquid chromatograph equipped with a 
Supelcogel H column (250 × 4.6 mm, 9 μm) and a L -7455 photodiode array detector at 
the wavelength of 220 nm. The mobile phase was 0.1% H 2SO 4 solution and flow rate 75 
 was fixed to 0.2 mL/min. Calibration curves were achieved using standard solutions of 
related carboxylic acids. The identification of the carboxylic acids was performed by the 
retention time ( tR) comparison and standard addition methods using standard 
substances.  
The TOC of the samples withdrawn from the treated solution at different 
electrolysis times was determined by Shimatzu TOC -VCSH analyser consisting of a non 
dispersive infra -red absorption detector (NDIR)  according to the 680 C combustion 
catalytic oxidation method. Platinum based catalyst was used to facilitate the 
combustion at 650 ° C. The carrier gas was oxygen with a flow rate  of 150 m L/min. The 
injection  volume was 50 μL.  
4.2.4 Toxicity measurements  
The toxicity of SAC and its intermediates generated in electro -Fenton processes 
was investigated on samples collected from solutions at different electrolysis times. 
Experiments were performed with the bio -luminescence marine bacteria V . fischeri  
(Hach Lange France SAS) by Microtox method according to the international standard 
process (OIN 11348 -3). Two values of the inhibition of the luminescence (%) were 
measured after 5 min and 15 min of exposure to sample s at 15 C using a Microtox 
model 500  system . 
 
4.3 Results and discussion  
4.3.1 Effect of supporting electrolyte on the degradation of SAC  
In order to investigate the effect of the supporting electrolyte  on the degradation 
kinetics of  SAC aqueous solutions, experiments were performed  in acidic medium (pH 
3.0) containing different supporting  electrolytes as 50 mM Na 2SO 4, 100 mM NaNO 3 
and 100 mM NaCl with three anodes (Fig. 4-1). The removal of SAC followed the  
first-order kinetic model and the apparent rate constant values ( kapp) were determined 76 
 accordingly and given in table 4-1.

For all the anodes, the complete removal of SAC almost finished  in a 30 min 
electrolysis period in the presence of Na 2SO 4 and NaNO 3. However, it was removed 77 
 only about 50% in 30 min in the case of NaCl. The main reason of this low degradation 
is related to the formation of active chlorine generated by the oxidation of chloride ions 
at the surface of DSA, Pt and BDD anode when NaCl  used as supporting electrolyte (Eq.  
(4-1)) (Özcan et al . 2008b ; Loaiza -Ambuludi et al . 2013 ; De Moura et al. 2014 ). 
Therefore , part of electrical energy provided is lost in this reaction.  
2Cl → Cl2 + e                                       (4-1) 
The electrogenerated active chlorine can acts as oxidation  mediator in the bulk of the 
solution, which can  accelerate the removal rate  of organic pollutants through the 
produc tion of HClO (Eq. ( 4-2)) according to some researches (Özcan et al . 2008b ; 
Loaiza -Ambuludi et al. 2013 ). 
Cl2 + H 2O → HClO + Cl + H+                           (4-2) 
However, in electro -Fenton process, the electrogenerated  chlorine can also react with 
Fe2+ (Eq. ( 4-3)) or decompose hydrogen  peroxide (Eq. ( 4-4)) (Loaiza -Ambuludi et al. 
2013 ), and then reducing the production rate of strong  oxidant •OH by Fenton’s 
reaction .  
2Fe2+ + Cl2 → 2Fe3+ + 2Cl                               (4-3) 
2H2O2 + Cl 2 → 2HCl + H 2O + O 2                          (4-4) 
Moreover, Cl could consume •OH and lead to the formation of ClOH• through Eq. ( 4-5) 
(Nidheesh  et al . 2014 ). Oxidative capacity of ClOH• towards organic compounds is 
much lower than that of •OH formed during the EF process.  
Cl + •OH → ClOH•                                     (4-5) 
Therefore, the removal efficiency of SAC was much lower when NaCl used as 
background electrolyte.  
It can also be  seen from Fig. 4-1 and Table 4-1 that the removal rate of SAC for 
Na2SO 4 was a little higher than that obtained for NaNO 3 in three electrolysis cells. For 
example, when DSA was used as anode and at 200 mA  applied current, the kapp for 
Na2SO 4 was 0.181 min1, while it was 0.170 min1 for NaNO 3. Therefore, Na 2SO 4 was 
chosen to be the supporting electrolyte in the following experiments.  78

4.3.2 Effect of anode materials on the removal and mineralization of SAC  
The removal  of SAC by electro -Fenton process using DSA, Pt and BDD as  
anodes was investigated by keeping the same cathode  as carbon -felt. Experiments were 
performed  at Fe2+ concentration 0.2 mM, Na2SO 4 concentration 50 mM, applied current 
200 mA and  pH0 3.0. 0.2 mM SAC could be completely removed in a 30 min  reaction  
for all the anode materials (Fig. 4-2a). The kapp values  for SAC removal using DSA, Pt 
and BDD anodes were very similar (0.181, 0.194 and 0.211 min1, respectively). 
However, when it comes to mineralization, BDD anode showed its great superiority. In 
a 360 min reaction, the TOC removal efficienc ies for SAC w ere 55.8%, 76.1% and 96.2% 
for DSA, Pt and BDD anodes, respectively (Fig. 4-2b). On the one hand, the BDD(•OH) 
radicals  can effectively mineralize short chain carboxylic acids generated in the 
electro -Fenton process, which  are relatively recalcitrant to mineralization  (Oturan et al. 
2013 ). On the other hand, Fe(III) –carboxylic acid complexes formed in electro -Fenton 
process were difficultly oxidizable with •OH produced in the medium from Fenton’s 
reaction and at the DSA and Pt anode surface from Eq. (4 -6) (Boye et al. 2002 ; Siré s et

 al. 2007 ). These complexes are completely destroyed using a BDD anode due to the 
great amount of •OH generated on its surface (Siré s et al. 2007 ) because of  its large O 2 
evolution overpotential. Since poor TOC removal  efficiency was obtained using DSA 
anode, only Pt and BDD anodes were applied in the following experiments.

 4.3.3 Effect of Fe2+ concentration on the removal of SAC  
The effect of Fe2+ (catalyst) concentration on the r emoval of SAC was examined 
by using the Fe2+ concentration of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 mM. The time -course of 
SAC concentration decay was determined by HPLC, where SAC displayed a 
well-defined peak at the retention time ( tR) 14.2 min under  the operating conditions of 
Fig. 4-3. 
As can be observed in Fig.4 -3 and Table 4-1, the removal rate for SAC was 
enhanced by increasing the Fe2+ concentration from 0.05 to 0.2 mM for both Pt and 
BDD anode. Moreover,  the kinetics of SAC removal increases more rapidly (1. 8 times) 
in the case of Pt/carbon -felt cell when the Fe2+ increased from 0.05 to 0 .2 mM, 
compared to BDD/carbon -felt cell.  Since the applied current was kept constant at 200 
mA, it can be assumed that the production rate of  H2O2 via the oxygen reduction wou ld 
be identical for all the Fe2+ concentrations under this study  (Oturan et al. 2010 ). Then 
increasing the Fe2+ concentration could lead to the increase of hydroxyl radicals 
generated via Fenton ’s reaction . These hydroxyl radicals reacted with SAC immediately, 
resultin g in the increase of SAC degradation. On the contrary, further increasing the 
Fe2+ concentration to 0.5 mM, the removal rate declined. The observed decrease in SAC 
degradation  rate upon increasing the Fe2+ concentration  might due to the role of Fe2+ as 
scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (Eq. ( 4-7)) which takes place with a large rate constant 
(k = 3.20 ×  108 M1 s1 ) (Oturan et al. 2010 ). Therefore, the optimal Fe2+ concentration 
for the removal of SAC was 0.2 mM.

electro -Fenton process. In order to investigate  the effect of current intensity on the

assessed above. The results were shown in Fig. 4-4 and Table 4-1. When Pt was used as 
anode, the removal rate of SAC increased as the applied current increasing. The 
electrolysis time for complete disapp earance  of SAC has been changed from >> 30 min 
for 50 mA to 30, 25, 20  and 15 min for 100, 200, 300 and 500 mA current intensity, 
respectively (Fig. 4 -4a). The kapp was increased from 0.07 to 0.26 min1 when applied 
current increased from 50 to 500 mA. The oxidation of SAC was accelerated by 
increasing the applied current  because of progressively large production of •OH 
(Loaiza -Ambuludi et al. 2013 ). 
As in the case of BDD anode, the removal rate of S AC increased significantly 
from 0.09 to 0.19 min1 when applied current increased from 50 to 200 mA. However, it 
decreased slightly to 0.16 min1 as applied current increased to 500 mA. At higher 
applied current than 200 mA, the 4e− reduction of O 2 leading to the formation of H 2O 
(Eq. ( 4-8)) would compete  with the formation of H 2O2 (Eq. ( 4-9)) (Özcan et al. 2008a ). 
O2 + 4H+ + 4e → 2H 2O          (4-8) 
O2 + 2H+ + 2e → H 2O2          (4-9) 
In addition , the progressive enhancement of other parasitic reactions at higher 
current, such as hydrogen evolution (Eq. ( 4-10)) at the  cathode and oxygen evolution 
(Eq. ( 4-11)) at the anode (Yahya et al . 2014 ), also contributed to the lower SAC 
removal rate.  It could be concluded that the comparatively better performance of BDD 
was more pronounced at lower current intensities.  
2H2O + 4e→ H2 + 2OH         (4-10) 
2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e          (4-11) 84

 (Mhemdi et al . 2013 ). Benzoic acid (BA) was employed as the standard competitor 
because the absolute rate constant of the reaction between BA and •OH ( kabs,BA ) is 
known as 4.30 ×  109 M–1 s–1 (Özcan et al. 2008a ; Oturan  et al. 2010 ). Experiments of 
competitive kinetics were carried out in the presence of equal concentrations of SAC 
and BA (0.1 mM). The hydroxylation  rate constant of SAC can be  calculated according 
to Eq. ( 4-12) and determined from Fig. 4-5 to be kabs,SAC  = (1.85  ±  0.01)  ×  109 M–1 s–1.

Interestingly, this rate constant value is the same as that reported by Toth et al  
(Toth et al. 2012 ).

4.3.6 The effect of Fe2+ concentration and applied current on SAC mineralization  
The mineralization ability of SAC by electro -Fenton process was assessed from 
the TOC abatement over electrolysis time. The influence of the Fe2+ concentration in the 
Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cells under the same condition of Fig. 4-3 was 
shown i n Fig. 4-6.

 Figure 4-6 indicated the optimal Fe2+ concentration for both Pt/carbon -felt and 
BDD/carbon -felt cells was 0.2 mM. When the Fe2+ concentration was higher than 0.2 
mM, the percentage of scavenged hydroxyl radicals from Fe2+ ions increased, thus the 
side reactions between Fe2+ ions and •OH (Eq. ( 4-7)) became more significant (Özcan et 
al. 2008a ). 
It can be seen by comparing Fig. 4 -6a and Fig. 4-6b that the min eralization of SAC 
was accelerated by the employ of BDD anode. At optimal conditions, BDD/carbon -felt 
cell achieved 93.3% mineralization in only 180 min, while this rate was about 70% for 
or Pt/carbon -felt cell at same time. A mineralization rate of 76.1% was reached by this 
cell at 360 min. B DD anode has the much higher O 2 evolution overpotential (1.27 V) 
than Pt (0.27 V) (Oturan et al . 2011 ). So the oxidative action of BDD(•OH) is much 
more efficient than Pt(•OH) (Martí nez -Huitle and Brillas 2009 ). Moreover,  the loosely 
bound BDD(•OH) formed at the anode surface (Eq. (4 -6)) can readily react  with organic 
pollutant due to the low adsorption ability  of •OH on BDD, in contrast to the 
chemisorbed radicals  Pt(•OH) which relatively strongly attached to the surface and less 
reactive (Oturan et al. 2011 ; Dirany et al. 2012 ).

The effect of applied current on the mineralization of 0.2 mM SAC solution was 
investigated under the same condition as Fig. 4-4 and the results were shown in Fig. 4-7. 
When applied current raised from 50 to 200 m A, the TOC removal efficiency was 
increased from 64.2% to 76.1% in Pt/carbon -felt cell and from 88.9% to 96.2% in 
BDD/carbon -felt cell. However, the TOC removal efficiency decreased slightly for both 
anodes when current intensity further increased to 500 mA . As applied current increased, 
the higher electrogenerated H 2O2 concentration was obtained and larger amounts of •OH 
was yielded from Fenton ’s reaction, and then a greater mineralization efficiency can be 
achieved due to the simultaneous degradation of SA C and its byproducts (Dirany et al. 
2012 ). But a current intensity higher than 200 mA would increase the extent of parasitic  
reactions (Eqs. ( 4-8), (4-10) and (4 -11)) and decrease the mineralization efficiency of 
SAC (Mousset et al. 2014 ).

 when initial SAC concentration was 0.2 mM, Fe2+ concentration was 0.2 mM, Na 2SO 4 
concentration was 50 mM, applied current was 200 mA and pH 0 was 3.0.  
Oxalic, formic , and maleic acid at retention time ( tR) of 8.90, 16.03  and 11.33, 
respectively, were observed  during electro -Fenton process. Since t he concentration of 
maleic acid was detected in trace  level, the changes of maleic acid concentration were 
not shown in Fig. 4-8. In Pt/carbon -felt cells, f ormic acid presented only in the first 20 
min and then it undergo to the mineralization (Fig. 4-8a) (Özcan et al. 2008a ). Oxalic 
acid showed the largest accumulation and the higher persistence due to its lower 
reactivity with •OH, which suggested that it can be generated from different ways as 
ultimate reaction intermediate (Dirany et al . 2010 ). In addition, oxalic acid was still 
existed with a concentration of 0.04 mM after a 360 min reaction. This relatively weak 
degradation of oxalic acid can be attributed to its high stability in the presence of ferric 
ions and its weaker reactivity toward •OH radicals  (k2 = 2.8 × 107 M−1 s−1) (Oturan et al. 
2008 ). This was also corresponding to the residual TOC remaining at the end of 
mineralization treatments in Pt/carbon -felt cells.  
On the other hand, oxalic acid showed  high persistence, but it disappeared at the 
end of the reaction  in BDD/carbon -felt cell (Fig. 4-8b). This phenomenon was in 
agreement with the faster TOC removal in BDD/carbon -felt cells as described in section 
4.3.6.

The evolution of the luminescence inhibition as function  of the electrolysis time for 
exposition time of 5 and 15 min are tested. Only the curves  obtained at both Pt and 
BDD anodes after a 15 -min exposure time were presented in Fig. 4-9, because the 
curves recorded after a 5 -min exposure time were  very similar. For both Pt and BDD 
anode, the toxicity increased significantly and reached the maximum luminescence 
inhibition peak at 30 min, indicating the formation of significantly  more toxic 
by-products at the beginning of the treatment. The inhibition ratio  decreas ed after 30 
min, in relation to the destruction of aromatics and the increase of the less toxic 
by-products. These less toxic byproducts mainly included the carboxylic acids, which 
present a very low  toxicity toward V. fischeri  bacteria (Dirany et al. 2012 ).

4.4 Conclusions  
It was demonstrated that electro -Fenton process with a Pt or BDD anode and a 
carbon felt cathode was a very effective method for the degradation of SAC in water.

 The effect of Fe2+ concentration and applied current on the removal and mineralization 
of SAC was investigated. For both anodes, SAC could be completely degrade in less 
than 30 min. The oxidative degradation of SAC followed pseudo -first-order kinetics. 
Absolute rate constant of hydroxylation reaction of SAC was determined as (1.85  ±  0.01)  
×  109 M–1 s–1 using competition kinetics method. The optimal conditions for SAC 
removal were SAC concentration 0.2 mM, Fe2+ concentration 0.2 mM, Na 2SO 4 
concentration 50 mM, applied current 200 mA and initial pH 3.0. The use of BDD 
anode yields a faster mineralization rate because of the higher oxidation power of BDD 
comparing with Pt. Short -chain aliphatic carboxylic acids such as oxalic, formic and 
maleic ac ids are identified as aliphatic by -products.  The bacteria luminescence 
inhibition  showed the toxicity of SAC solution increased at the first 30 min of 
electrolysis, and then it decreased after a 60 min reaction for both Pt and BDD anodes .

 5.1 Introduction  
In this part, t he effect of the Fe2+ concentration and applied current on the 
mineralization of sucralose  (SUC) was examined. The effect of applied current on the 
mineralization efficiency was assessed . The aliphatic short -chain carboxylic acids and 
inorganic ions released during electro -Fenton process were monitored  by ion -exclusion 
chromatography and ion chromatography (IC) . The variation of toxicity of SUC 
solution and its intermediates was determined by Microtox method.  
5.2 Materials and methods  
5.2.1 Chemicals  
Sucralose (1,6-dichloro -1,6-dideoxy -β-D-fructofuranosyl -4-chloro -4-deoxy -α-D- 
galactopyranoside , C12H19Cl3O8) was purchased from Sigma -Aldrich . The chemical 
structure and main characteristics of SUC  were presented in Table 2-1. Analytical grade  
anhydrous sodium sulfate (supporting electrolyte) and ferrous sulfate heptahydrated 
(catalyst source) were obtained from Sigma -Aldrich and Acros Organics, respectively. 
Analytical grade carboxylic acids and other chemicals used for chromatographic 
analys is were purchased from Acros, Merck, Sigma , Riedel -de Ha ë n and Fluka. 
Ultrapure water used for  the preparation of the working solutions and HPLC eluting 
solutions  was obtained from a Millipore Milli -Q (simplicity 185) system  with 
resistivity > 18 M Ω cm at room temperature.  
5.2.2 Electrochemical apparatus and procedures  
Bulk experiments were conducted in an open, undivided and cylindrical glass cell 
of 250 mL capacity containing 220 mL SUC solution . Either  a cylindrical Pt mesh (4.5 
cm height, i.d. = 3.1 cm, Platecxis, France) or a 24 cm2 thin-film BDD electrode 
(CONDIAS GmbH, Germany)  was used as anode, and a  87.5 cm2 piece of carbon felt 
(17.5 ×  5  cm, Carbon -Lorraine, France) was used as cathode . In all electrolyses , the 97 
 anode was centered in the cel l, surrounded by the carbon felt  which placed on the inner 
wall of  the cell covering the totality of the internal perimeter. H 2O2 was generated  from 
the reduction of O 2 dissolved in the solution.  The continuous saturation of oxygen  at 
atmospheric pressure  was assured by bubbling compressed air through a frit at about 0.5 
L/min , starting 5 min  before electrolysis . All the electrolytic trials  were conducted under 
constant current conditions by a Hameg HM8040 -3 triple power supply (Germany).   
The degradation experiments were performed using 0.2 mM SUC solution with 
constant stirring by using a magnetic  stirrer . 50 mM Na 2SO 4 was added into the SUC  
solution as supporting electrolyte . A catalytic quantity of ferrous ion was added into the 
solution  before the beginning of electrolysis. The initial pH (pH 0) of SUC solutions was 
measured with a CyberScan pH 1500 pH -meter (Eutech Instrument, USA) and set at 3.0 
(±0.1), adjusting by the addition of 1 M sulfuric acid.  
5.2.3 Analytical methods and proced ures 
The TOC of the samples withdrawn from treated solutions at different electrolysis 
times were determined by Shimatzu TOC -VCSH analyser consisting of a non -dispersive 
infra -red absorption detector (NDIR)  according to the 680 C combustion catalytic 
oxidation method. Platinum was applied as catalyst to facilitate the combustion at 
650 ° C. The carrier gas was oxygen with a flow rate  of 150 m L/min. The injection 
volume was 50 μL.  
The short -chain carboxylic acids were identified a nd quantified by ion -exclusion 
HPLC using a L-7100 pump, a Merck Lachrom liquid chromatograph equipped  with a 
Supelcogel H column (250 × 4.6 mm, 9 μm) and a L -7455 photodiode array detector at 
the wavelength of 220 nm. The mobile phase was 0.1% H 2SO 4 solut ion and flow rate 
was fixed to 0.2 mL/min. Calibration curves were achieved using standard solutions of 
related carboxylic acids. The identification of the carboxylic acids was performed by the 
retention time ( tR) comparison and standard addition methods u sing standard 
substances.  
Inorganic ions ( Cl–) released in the electro -Fenton process were monitored by ion 98 
 chromatography with a Dionex ICS -1000 Basic Ion Chromatography  (IC) System 
equipped with an IonPac AS4A -SC (anion exchange) 250 ×  4 mm column and fitted to 
a DS6 conductivity detector containing a cell heated at 35 C under control through a 
Chromeleon SE software . The mobile phase was a mixture of 3.6 mM Na 2CO 3 and 3.4 
mM NaHCO 3 solution with a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min . The volum e of injections was 25 
μL. 
5.2.4 Toxicity measurements  
The toxicity of SUC  and its intermediates generated during the electrolyses  were 
investigated via samples collected from treated solutions at different times. Experiments 
were performed with the bio -luminescence marine bacteria V . fischeri  (Hach Lange 
France SAS) by Microtox method according to the international standard process (OIN 
11348 -3). Two val ues of the inhibition of the luminescence (%) were calculated after 5 
and 15 min of exposure to samples at 15 C. 
 
5.3 Results and discussion  
5.3.1 Effect of Fe2+ concentration on the mineralization of sucralose  
Mineralization efficiency in both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cells  was 
assessed by solution TOC (as equivalent of dissolved organic carbon) measurements 
during electrolysis of SUC  solutions. The effect  of Fe2+ concentration on the  
mineralization of SUC  solution was monitored by using the Fe2+ concentration  of 0.05, 
0.1, 0.2, 0.3  and 0.5 mM. The SUC  concentration was fixed at 0.2 mM, applied current 
was 200 mA and initial pH was 3.0. As can be observed in Fig. 5 -1, the mineralization  
for SUC was enhanced by increasing the Fe2+ concentration from 0.05 to 0.2 mM for 
both Pt and BDD anode.  Since the applied current was kept constant at 200 mA, it can 
be assumed that the production rate of  H2O2 via the oxygen reduction would be identical 
for all the Fe2+ concentrations under this study  (Oturan et al. 2010 ). On the basis of the 
same H2O2 production rate,  a higher  Fe2+ concentration could lead to the increase of 99 
 hydroxyl radicals generated in bulk of solution via Fenton's reaction (Eq. ( 5-1)). These 
hydroxyl radicals  would  react with SUC immediately, resulting in the increase of SUC  
mineralization .  
Fe2+ + H 2O2 → Fe3+ + OH + •OH           (5-1) 
However, further increasing the Fe2+ concentration to 0.5 mM, the mineralization 
efficiency of SUC  declined evidently in both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cells . 
The negative influence of higher  Fe2+ concentration  might due to  the role of Fe2+ as 
scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (Eq. ( 5-2)) which takes place with a large rate constant 
(k = 3.20 ×  108 M1 s1 ) (Siré s et al. 2007b ; Oturan et al. 2010 ). Therefore, the value of 
0.2 mM was chosen as the optimal Fe2+ concentration  under these conditions and used 
in the following experiments.  
Fe2+ + •OH → Fe3+ + OH           (5-2) 
By comparing Fig. 5 -1a and Fig. 5 -1b, it can be seen that the use of BDD anode 
lead to the acceleration of SUC mineralization . At optimal condition (Fe2+ concentration 
0.2 mM),  96.1% of the initial TOC value was removed  in BDD/carbon -felt cell  after 
only 180 min reaction, while it takes 240 min for Pt/carbon -felt cell t o achieve 94.2% of 
mineralization efficiency. This fact can be explained by following reasons: Firstly , a 
much higher quantities of BDD(•OH) than Pt(•OH) is provided when electrolysis is 
operated at the current within the  water discharge region  (Eq. (5 -3) and (5 -4)) (Brillas et 
al. 2005 ; Panizza and Cerisola 2005 ; Brillas et al. 2009 ).  
BDD + H 2O →  BDD(•OH) + H+ + e         (5-3) 
Pt + H 2O →  Pt(•OH) + H+ + e          (5-4) 
Secondly, since BDD anode presents the highest O 2-overvoltage (1.27 V), which is 
much higher than Pt anode (0.27  V) (Martí nez -Huitle and Brillas 2009 ; Oturan et al. 
2011 ), the oxidative action of BDD(•OH) is rather effective than Pt(•OH) (Oturan et al. 
2011 ). Thirdly , due to the low adsorption ability  of •OH on BDD, the physisorbed  and 
labile BDD(•OH) formed at the anode surface (Eq. ( 5-3)) can readily react  with organic 
pollutant, in contrast to the chemisorbed radicals  typically formed at Pt  surface (Eq. 
(5-4)) which limited the oxidation ability of Pt(•OH) (Oturan et al. 2011 ; Dirany et al. 100 
 2012 ,). Finally, BDD anode contributed to the degradation of all the byproducts, even 
the most refractory ones  (Dirany et al. 2012 ).

 5.3.2 Effect of current intensity on the mineralization of SUC aquous solutions  
In order to investigate  the effect of current intensity on the mineralization  of SUC,  
several experiments were carried out  by varying applied current  in the range of 100–500 
mA at the optimal Fe2+ concentration of  0.2 mM as assessed above. The results were 
shown in Fi g. 5-2. In both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cells , the mineralization 
efficiency  of SUC solution increased significantly as the applied current increas ed from 
100 to 200 mA . Taking Pt/carbon -felt cell as an example, when current intensity was 
100 mA, the TOC removal efficiency was 69.7% in a 360 min treatment . Increasing the 
current to 200 mA resulted in 94.1% of mineralization efficiency in a 240 min reaction. 
The mineralization  of SUC aqueous so lution was accelerated by increasing the applied 
current  because both Fe2+ regeneration and H 2O2 production would be promoted, and 
then large amount  of •OH would be produced (Boye et al. 2002 ; Lin et al. 2014 ). When 
the applied current increased from 200 to 500 mA, the minralization efficiency of 
sucralose in both cells changed slightly. On the one hand, a higher current leads to the 
increase of parasitic reactions, such as hydrogen  evolution (Eq.(5-5)) and oxygen 
evolution (Eq. ( 5-6)) reactions  (Dirany et al. 2010 ; Dirany et al. 2012 ). 
2H2O + 2e– → H 2 + 2OH–           (5-5) 
2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e            (5-6) 
On the other hand, when the current density was further increased, excessive 
hydroxyl radicals would be consumed via the following side reactions  (Eqs. ( 5-7) and 
(5-8)) (Wu et al. 2012 ; Lin et al. 2014 ). As a result , 200 mA was selected as the optimal 
current  value  and used in the remaining experiments.  
H2O2 + •OH → HO 2•
 + H 2O  (5-7) 
HO 2•
 + •OH →  H2O + O 2             (5-8) 
It also be observed from Fig. 5 -2 that SUC solutions  could be almost totally 
mineralized after 240 min of electrolysis at optimal  conditions (Fe2+ concentration 0.2 
mM and applied current 200 mA) in both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cells , 
indicating that electro -Fenton process with the use of Pt or BDD anode and a piece of 
carbon -felt cathode was quite effective for the  mineralization of SUC  in aqueous 102 
 medium.

MCE  =      s     C

homogenize units (=  3600 s /h × 12,000 mg of C /mol), m is the number of carbon

C12H19Cl3O8 + 16H 2O → 12CO 2 + 51H+ + 3Cl + 48e          (5-10) 
By comparing Fig. 5 -3(a) and Fig. 5 -3(b), it can be seen that the MCE in 
Pt/carbon -felt cell was lower at all the chosen time than that in BDD/carbon -felt cell . 
This was attributed  to the low oxidation power of Pt anode (Oturan et al. 2011 ). 
Figure 5-3 indicated that the MCE values decreased with rising applied current 
from 100 to 500 mA in both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cell s. For example, the 
MCE values after 60 min of electrolysis in BDD/carbon -felt cell  for 100, 200, 300 and 
500 mA were 31.49%, 20.17%, 14.40% and 8.90%, respectively. This was related to the 
involvement of some parasitic reactions and particularly the hydro gen gas evolution  
reaction (Eq. (5 -5)), which competed with the formation of H 2O2 (Eq.(5 -11)) (Özcan et 
al. 2008 ).  
O2 + 2H+ + 2e → H 2O2            (5-11) 
Figure 5-3 also showed that the MCE values decreased continuously from the beginning 
to the end of the electrolysis for every trial in both cells. This was due to  the gradual 
formation of  intermediates such as carboxylic acids that are more difficult to destroy  by 
BDD(•OH) and also due to mass transport limitations because of the presence of small 
concentration of organic matter  (Siré s et al. 2007a ; Özcan et al. 2008 ). 104

 0.2 mM SUC solution  aqueous solution  was treated when Fe2+ concentration was 0.2 
mM, Na 2SO 4 concentration was 50 mM, applied current was 200 mA and pH 0 was 3.0.  
The concentration of carboxylic acids was monitored by ion -exclusion HPLC  and 
the results were shown in Fig. 5 -4. In both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD/carbon -felt cells, 
oxalic, pyruvic,  form ic and glycolic acid at retention time ( tR) 8.90, 1 1.57,  16.03 and 
14.53 , respectively, were observed . As shown in Fig. 5 -4, formic acid was observed as 
soon as the electrolysis  started  in both cells . Its concentration reaches the maximum 
value of  0.090 mM after a 20 min reaction in Pt/carbon -felt cell and 0.096 mM after 
only 10 min in BDD /carbon -felt cell. Then it decrease d gradually to be  completely 
mineralized after  180 min and 60 min in Pt/carbon -felt and BDD /carbon -felt cells, 
respectively. Pyruvic a cid was also generated at the beginning of the electrolysis  and 
followed the accumulation -destruction cycles  in two cells. It disappeared after 120 min 
electrolysis in both cells. The accumulation of glycolic acid was a little  slow er and 
appeared after 7 min of electrolysis . Oxalic acid showed the largest accumulation and 
the higher persistence  in both cells  due to its high stability in the presence of ferric ions 
and its weaker reactivity toward •OH radicals  (k2 = 2.8×107 M−1 s−1) (Oturan et al. 2008 ). 
This suggested that oxalic acid  would  be generated from different ways as ultimate 
reaction intermediates . 
Moreover, all the carboxylic acids were vanished after a 360 min electrolysis  in 
Pt/carbon -felt cell and a 240 min electrolysis in BDD /carbon -felt cell, which was 
corresponding to the residual TOC remaining at the end of mineralization treatments 
(Fig. 5-2a and Fig. 5-2b).

 solution as inorganic ions and the concentration of Cl was shown in Figure 5 -5. When 
Pt was used as anode, a progressive accumulation of Cl was observed, until reaching 
the expected maximu m value of 0.6 mM. In contrast, the release of Cl − was increased 
significantly and reached a maximum concentration of 0.544 mM after 30 min, 
whereupon it decreased until a final value of 0.063 mM at 360 min. This phenomenon 
could be explained by the oxidation of Cl to Cl 2 and/or ClO−/HClO, ClO 3−, and ClO 4− 
by BDD(•OH) and/or •OH in the bulk  (Randazzo et al. 2011 ; Dirany et al. 2012 ).

5.3.6 The evolution of toxicity with reaction time  
In order to monitored the potential toxicity of sucralose  and its intermediates , 0.2 
mM sucralose  was electrolyzed in the existence of 0.2 mM Fe2+ at 200 mA using 
Microtox method for both Pt/carbon -felt and BDD /carbon -felt cells. The percentage of 
bacteria luminescence inhibition  versus the electrolysis time after 15 min exposure  
times of V. fischeri  luminescent bacteria to  the sucralose  solutions  was shown in Fig. 
5-6. 
When Pt was used as anode , there were  several peaks due to the degradation 
primary intermediates and formation to secondary/tertiary intermediates tha t were  more

 toxic than the previous sucralose solution in the first 60 min electrolysis (Feng et al . 
2014 ). The other peak appeared at 120 min, indica ting the generation of other toxic 
byproducts. From  120 to 240 min, the inhibition percentage decreased sharply.  The 
toxicity was much  lower than the untreated sucralose  solution  at 240 min, in relation to 
the increase of the less toxic byproducts , such as carboxylic acids, which present a very 
low toxicity toward V. fischeri  bacteria  (Dirany et al. 2012 ). Consequently, the toxicity 
kept stable from 240 min to the end of the electrolysis.  
The curves obtained for BDD anode showe d a similar  behavior at the beginning of 
the electrolysis as Pt anode.  Several peaks were obtained, indicating the formation of 
some intermediates tha t were  more toxic than the previous sucralose solution in a 60 
min reaction . The secondary peak appeared at 40 min and showed the secondary 
intermediates still more toxic than the original sucralose  solution.  The secondary peak 
which appeared at 240 min was much lower than the primary peak, showing the toxicity 
of secondary interme diates were much lower than the primary byproducts . After 240 
min, the inhibition percentage decreased s ignificantly and was much  lower than the 
untreated sucralose  solution  at the end of the electrolysis , showing the disappearance of 
toxic intermediate pr oducts .

 5.4 Conclusions  
Electro -Fenton process using a carbon -felt cathode and a Pt or BDD anode  was 
successfully applied to the mineralization of sucralose in aqueous solutions in this study. 
The optimal conditions for the mineralization of 0.2 mM sucralose solut ion were Fe2+ 
concentration 0.2 mM, Na 2SO 4 concentration 50 mM, applied current 200 mA and 
initial pH 3.0.  At optimal conditions, sucralose could be totally mineralized in 240 min 
for BDD anode and 360 min for Pt anode. Short -chain aliphatic carboxylic aci ds such as 
oxalic, pyruvic,  formic  and glycolic are identified as aliphatic byproducts  during the 
electro -Fenton process . Cl atoms were found in the structure of sucralose and were 
converted to Cl. The bacteria luminescence inhibition  showed the toxicity of sucralose  
solution increased at the beginning of electrolysis, and then it declined until much lower 
than the original  sucralose  solution at the end of the reaction .

 6.1 Introduction  
In this part, peroxydisulfate (PDS), which has  the similar structure of O -O bond 
contained in H 2O2(Hou et al . 2012 ), was activated by goethite to generate sulfate 
radicals and remove Orange II from water in a electrochemical (EC) reactor 
(electro/α -FeOOH/peroxydisulfate process).  
The traditional one -factor-at-a-time approach has been widely used to study the 
effects of various factors in most experiments. Experimental factors are varied one at a 
time, with the remaining factors being held constant ly (Zhang et al. 2011 ). This method 
fails to investigate the interactive influences of different variables. When a combination 
of several independent variables and their interactions affect decolorization efficiency, 
response surface methodology (RSM) is effective for optimizin g the operating 
parameters in multivariable systems (Gong et al. 2010 ; Zhang et al. 2011 ). As one of 
the RSM designs, Box -Behnken design (BBD) is known as a modified central 
composite ex perimental design (Ay et al . 2009 ; Zhang et al . 2011 ). BBD is an 
independent, rotatable quadratic design with no embedded factorial or fractional 
factorial points where the variable combinations are at the midpoints of the edges of the 
variable space and at the center. In addition, BBD requires fewer runs than other RSM 
designs with the same number of variables. For example, only 15 runs are needed for a 
three -parameter experimental design. As a result, BBD was applied in this study to 
investigate the effect of electric cur rent, α-FeOOH concentration and PDS concentration 
on the results of the pseudo -first-order decolorization  rate constant of Orange II (a kind 
of widely used zao dyes) in electro/α -FeOOH/peroxydisulfate process . 
6.2 Materials and methods  
6.2.1 Chemicals  
Orange II (4-(2-hydroxynaphthylazo) benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt) was 
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China) and used without 
further purification. The Chemical structure and main characteristics of Orange II  were 114 
 presented in Tabl e 6-1. α-FeOOH was obtained from Sigma -Aldrich. Stock solution was

from Yangzhou Jintong Source, Co., Ltd. (China). One 5 ×  11.9 cm plate anode 
(Ti/RuO 2-IrO 2) and one plate cathode (stainless steel) of the same dimensions were 
arranged parallel to each other at a distance of 4.0 cm. Prior to the electrolysis, the 
initial pH (pH 0) of Orange II  solutions were measured with a Mettler -Toledo FE20 
pH-meter (Mettler -Toledo Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai) and adjusted by sulfuric 
acid and sodium hydroxide. A magnetic stirrer (model 78 -1, Hangzhou Instrument 
Motors Factory, China) was applied to achieve the transport of electroactive matter 
toward the electrode and en sure homogeneity throughout the reaction. The DC power 
supply was initiated  when PDS solutions and α-FeOOH  were added to the electrolytic 
cell. Samples were taken from electrolytic reactor  at each predetermined  time interval . 115 
 These samples were filtered th rough 0.22 μm membranes (Millipore Co.) before 
analysis and then mixed with the same volume of methanol to quench the reaction 
before analysis.  
6.2.3 Analytical methods and procedures  
The absorbenc e of Orange II  was measured at maximum absorption wavelength of  
485 nm using a Rayleigh UV -9100 spectrophotometer (Rayleigh Co., China). The 
UV-visible spectrum from 200 to 800 nm was achieved by a spectrophotometer 
(Shimadzu, UV -1700). The concentration of residual PDS was measured by an 
iodometric titra tion method  (Wahba et al. 1959 ).Total organic carbon (TOC) analyses 
were carried out with non dispersive infra red absorption detector (NDIR) using an 
Analytikjena multi N/C 3100 analyzer. The carrier gas was oxygen with  a flow rate  of 
150 mL/min . The structure  of α-FeOOH  was characterized by X -ray diffraction (XRD).  
XRD patterns are collected on a X’Pert Pro  Xray diffractometer  (PANalytical B.V ., 
Holland) , using a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).The X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS) was operated on a ESCALAB 250Xi  spectrometer (Thermo fisher, USA ) which 
equipped w ith AlKα X -ray source.  The XPS data analysis was performed using  the 
XPSPeak4.1 program with a symmetric Gaussian –Lorentzian sum function and Shirley 
background subtraction.   
6.2.4 Box-Behnken design (BBD)  
Box-Behnken statistical experiment design and response surface methodology 
were employed to investigate the effects of the three independent variables on the 
response functions. The independent variables were electric current (X 1), α-FeOOH 
dosage  (X2) and PDS concentration (X 3). The low, center and hi gh levels for each 
variable are designed as -1, 0 and +1, respectively as illustrated in Table 6 -2. The 
experimental levels for each variable were determined based results from preliminary 
experiments of operating parameters. The dependent variable or obje ctive function was 
the pseudo -first-order decolorization  rate constant (Y).  116

As can be seen in Table 6 -3, the total number of  experiments in this study was 15 based 
on 3 levels and a 3 factor  experimental design, with three replicates at the center of the  
design for estimation of a pure error sum of squares. Experimental  data from the BBD

6.3 Results and discussion  
6.3.1 Decolorization of Orange II under different systems  
   In order or investigate the decolorization efficiency of Orange II under different 
oxidation systems, 50 mg/L Orange II solution was treated for 120 min by PDS alone, 
α-FeOOH alone, α -FeOOH/PDS process, EC alone, EC/α -FeOOH process, EC/PDS 
process and E C/α-FeOOH/PDS process. The results were shown in Fig. 6 -1. It can be 
seen from Fig. 6 -1a that little decolorization occurred when Orange II was treated by 
PDS alone, because PDS is stable at ambient temperature and its oxidation power is 
limited ( E0 = 2.01 V) ( Zhao et al. 2010 ; Wu et al. 2012b ), which could hardly degrade 
Orange II . What’ more, the remaining percentage of PDS after 120 min reaction in the 
PDS alone process was 98.2% (Fig. 6 -1b), indicating almost no PDS decomposed in 
this cas e. Negligible color removed was also observed when α -FeOOH alone was 
applied, indicating the effect of adsorption of Orange II  decolorization  was not obvious 
under the condition investigated. Orange II  was hardly removed in α-FeOOH/PDS 
process  and the remaining percentage of PDS was 95.7%, beause PDS can not be 
activated by Fe(III) on the surface of α-FeOOH . When treated by EC alone, 51.8% of 
50 mg/L Orange II was decolorizated because a certain amount of hydroxyl radicals 
(M(•OH)) was formed a s intermediate of water discharge on DSA anode (M) (Eq. 
(9))(Özcan et al. 2009 ). 
M(H 2O) → M(•OH) + H+ + e–         (6-3) 
Adding 0.5 g/L α-FeOOH  to the electrolytic reactor ( EC/α -FeOOH process ) could 118 
 not improve the decolorization efficiency of Orange II . The decolorization efficiency 
was 57.2% after 120 min reaction in EC/α -FeOOH process. The deco lorization 
efficiency improved significantly  to 81.4% in EC/PDS process, which might be 
attributed to sulfate radicals produced via Eq. (6 -4). 50.0% of PDS was decomposed in 
this case (Fig. 6 -1b). 
S2O82– + e– → SO 4•– + SO 42–          (6-4) 
The decolorization efficiency of Orange II  was 90.9% and the remaining 
percentage of PDS was 38.7% in the process of EC/ α-FeOOH  /PDS, indicating Fe(II) 
can be generated by the cathodic reduction of Fe(III) (Eq. (6 -5)), and then more sulfate 
radicals can formed by Fe(II) activating PDS reaction  (Eq. (6 -6)).

In order to investigate the mechanism of Orange II decolorization in EC/α-FeOOH  
/PDS  process, the catalyst α-FeOOH  was characterized by XRD and XPS. The XRD 
analysis was applied to define the structure of fresh  α-FeOOH  and the obtained patterns 
were shown on Fig. 6 -2. The peaks at the angle of 2 θ 21.223, 33.241、34.700、
36.649、39.984、41.186、50.613、53.237 and 59.023  are specific of  α-FeOOH  
(Jaiswal et al. 2013 ).

Fig. 6 -2 XRD pattern of α-FeOOH  (Reference X -ray lines belonging to α-FeOOH  (JCPDS card n°  
29-0713) are given at the bottom of the figure)  
XPS was used to applied to observe  the surface properties of  α-FeOOH  before and 
after reaction.  The results were showed in Fig. 6 -3. The domain peak for O 1s was at 
531.6 eV. The O 1s peak of α-FeOOH  is shifted significantly higher (0.4 eV) than that 
of α-Fe2O3 (531.2 eV) (Guo et al. 2010 ), indicating the proton on the hydroxyl oxygen 
has some interaction with the O 2– oxygen (McIntyre and Zetaruk 1977 ). Fig. 6 -3a 
showed the O 1s peak of α-FeOOH  did not change obviously after the reaction. So the 
properties of  oxygen on the surface of α-FeOOH  did not change during the 
EC/α-FeOOH /PDS  process. The peaks of Fe 2p spe ctrum at 711, 719, and 725 eV  
represented the binding energies of Fe 2p3/2, shake -upsatellite Fe 2p3/2, and Fe 2p1/2, 
respectively  (Nie et al. 2009 ). As can be seen from Fig. 6 -3b, there was no Fe (II) on the 
surface of α-FeOOH  before the reaction. However, The ratio of Fe(II)/Fe(III) on the 
surface of  α-FeOOH  adsorbent increased to 0.80 after 120 min reaction. This implied 
more Fe(II) was generated on the surface of  α-FeOOH  particles during 
EC/α-FeOOH /PDS  process  (Eq. ( 6-5)).

Based on the results and the previous studies, (Liang et al. 2007 ; Özcan et al. 2009 ; 
Lin et al. 2013 ), the mechanism of EC/ α-FeOOH /PDS  process  was shown  in Fig . 6-4. 
Fe(II) was generated by the reduction and transformation of Fe(III) on the surface of  
α-FeOOH  due to the direct electron transfer (Eq. ( 6-5)), and then Fe(II) activated PDS

 to generate  sulfate radicals  (Eq. (6 -6)). Meanwhile, hydroxyl radicals were generated 
both by water discharge on DSA anode (Eq. ( 6-3)) and the reaction between sulfate 
radicals and H 2O or OH– (Eqs. ( 6-7) and ( 6-8)) (Liang et al. 2007 ; Saien et al. 2011 ). 
Orange II was degraded by both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals.

Fig. 6 -4 Proposed mechanism of EC/α-FeOOH /PDS  process  
6.3.2 Effect of initial pH  
The effect of pH on degradation of Orange II was investigated when initial Orange 
II concentration was 50 mg/L, α -FeOOH dosage was 0.5 g/L, PDS concentration was 2 
g/L, Na 2SO 4 solution  concentration was 50 mM and the electrical current was 0.5 A. 
The initial pH values investigated were 3, 7 and 10. As it indicated in Fig. 6 -5, no 
significant effect of pH on the decolorization efficiency was observed. The final 
efficiency was 90.9%, 92.1 % and 89.1% at initial pH 3.0, 7.0 and 10.0, respectively. It 
is reported that sulfate radicals could react with H 2O or OH– to produce hydroxyl 
radicals (Eqs. (6 -7) and (6 -8)) (Liang et al. 2007 ; Saien et al. 2011 ). Either H+ could be 
generated or OH– could be consumed, which led to the reduction of solution pH in 
EC/FeOOH /PDS process.  Moreover, the reaction of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical 
123 
 (Eq. (6 -9)) as well as the decomposition of PDS in water (Eq. (6 -10)) would generate 
HSO 4−. The dissociation of HSO 4− (Eq. (6 -11)) would further release H+ and decrease 
the solution pH (Kusic et al. 2011 ; Wu et al. 2012b ). 
SO 4•− + •OH → HSO 4− + 1/2O 2           (6-9) 
    S2O82– + H 2O → 2 HSO 4− + 1/2O 2       (6-10) 
HSO 4− → SO 42− + H+            (6-11) 
Therefore, the final pH was almost the same value (about 2.5) and the 
decolorization of Orange II tended to be operated under similar conditions as the 
reaction proceeded. This indicated that the EC/α -FeOOH /PDS process could be 
successfully applied at a wide range of initial pH. Since pH of most ac tual texile 
effluent was neutral , pH 7.0 was chosen as the optimal initial value used in the 
following experiments.

 6.3.3 Response surface analysis  
6.3.3.1 Main variables  
The full factorial BBD with three factors in three levels as well as results of 
Orange II decolorization rate constant for each run are listed in Table 6 -3. Based on 
Table 6 -3, the main effects plot and the interaction plots for Orange II decolorization 
rate constant at 120 min were developed. The main effects plot illustrated that the 
effec ts of electrical current, α -FeOOH dosage and PDS concentration on Orange II 
decolorization rate constant were positive (Fig. 6 -6). This means that the greater 
removal efficiency could be achieved at high level (+1) of each factor than that at low 
level ( –1) of the factor. Among the variables, the influence of electrical current was the 
greatest, and the second one was the PDS concentration. The influence of α -FeOOH 
dosage was softer than the other two variables at 120 min.

 among the factors. One factor was fixed at its high (+1) or low ( –1) level while the other 
was investigated (Domínguez et al . 2010 ). As can be seen in Fig. 6 -4, the curves of 
interaction between α -FeOOH dosage and PDS concentration are across, indi cating the 
interaction between two variables is significant. The curves of interaction between 
electrical current and PDS concentration are tending to cross. It may assume that the 
interaction between two variables is significant. The interaction effect be tween electrical 
current and α -FeOOH dosage are less significant than that between α -FeOOH dosage 
and PDS concentration. This was also confirmed by the high probability value ((Prob > 
F) > 0.1) through analysis of variance (ANOV A).

6.3.3.3 Fitting model and analysis of variance  
In order to justify the significance and adequacy of the model, the ANOV A analysis 
is required. The value of (Prob > F) was used as a tool to check the significant of each 
model terms. The smaller the value of (Prob > F) means the more significant of the 
corresponding model term. Generally, the value of (Prob > F) over 0.1 implies that th e 
model term is insignificant (Zhang et al. 2010 ). Based on the results shown in Table 6-4,

The coefficients of determination R2 gave the proportion of the total variation in 
the response variable explained. The R2 obtained in this work (0.9507) ensured a 
satisfactory adjustment of the quadratic model to the experimental data. The coefficient 
of variation (CV) is a measure expressing standard deviation as a percentage of the 
mean. It illustrates the extent to which the data were dispersed. The lower values of CV 
give better reproducibility (Ahmad et al. 2005 ; Zinatizadeh et al. 2006 ). In this work, 
the CV value (10.6%) was within the acceptable range (0.5 –13.5%) (Zinatizadeh et al. 
2006 ; Wu et al. 2012a ). In addition, adequate precision was used to assess the signal to 
noise ratio. The value of adequate precision greater than 4 is considered to give accurate 
prediction  (Kö rbahti 2007 ). Therefore, the adequate precision value of 9.126 indicated 
adequate signals for the models to be used to navigate the design space.

6.3.3.4 Adequacy check of the model  
The examination of residuals was employed to investigate the model adequacy.  It 127 
 would give poor or misleading results if the model was not adequate fit (Wu et al . 
2012a ). The normal probability and studentized residuals plots illustrate whether the 
studentized residuals follow a normal distribution. Normal plot presented at Fig. 6 -8 is 
normally distributed a nd resemble a straight line, indicating that there is no apparent 
problem with normality and no need for transformation of response (Khataee et al . 
2010 ). Fig. 6-9 shows the studentized residual versus predicted value, and the residuals 
appear to be a random scatter. It suggests that the equality of variance does not seem to 
be violated (Grčić et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, the similarity between predicted and actual 
values of the response which was illustrated in Fig. 6 -10 indicated that there was no 
significant violation of the models and the models were satisfactory and accurate.

The 3D response surfaces plots were developed based on the RSM equation and 
showed in Fig. 6 -11. There is an optimum current value for Orange II decolorization  
rate. In other word, increasing electrical current to certain extent could increase Orange 
II decolorization  rate, while further increasing electrical current would decrease the

 decolorization  rate. On the one hand, increase of applied current could promote the 
conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) on the surface of the catalyst (Eq. (6 -5)) which resulted in 
more sulfate radicals generated on α -FeOOH surface. On the o ther hand, higher 
electrical current improves the generation of sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals via 
electron transfer reaction (Eq. (6 -4)) and water discharge on DSA anode (M) (Eq. (6 -3)) 
(Lin et al . 2014 ; Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2014 ), respectively. However,  further 
increasing the electrical current might lead to the side reactions and particularly the 
hydrogen gas evolution (Eq. (6 -12)) which lead to the decline of the decolorization  rate 
(Wu et al. 2012a ). 
    2H2O + 2e– → H 2 + 2OH–           (6-12) 
Fig. 6 -11 also showed that the decolorization rate of Orange II increased slightly 
with the increase of α -FeOOH dosage and PDS concentration, because higher 
concentration of catalyst and PDS favored the generation of sulfate raidcals.

 6.3.4 Sta bility of α -FeOOH  
The recycle experiments were performed to investigate the stability of α -FeOOH . 
The solid was easily removed from the electrochemical reactor after each repetitive 
oxidation process, then washed by deionised  water, dried in the vacuum oven and stored 
at ambient temperature. The initial concentration of Orange II solution was fixed at 50 
mg/L, PDS concentration was 2 g/L, α -FeOOH  dosage was 0.8 g/L, Na 2SO 4 solution 
concentration was 50 mM, initial pH was 7.0 and the applied current was 0.5 A. As 
shown in Fig. 6 -12, the decolorization  efficiencies of Orange II during three reaction 
cycles ranged from 86.5% to 92.1%, indicating α -FeOOH  is stable and can be reused.

6.3.5 Changes in the UV -visible spectrum and mineralization efficiency of Orange 
II 
To clarify the changes in molecular and structural characterist ics of Orange II as a 
result of oxidation in the electro/α -FeOOH/ PDS process, representative UV visible 
spectra changes in the dye solution as a function of reaction time were depicted and the

 corresponding spectra are indicated in Fig. 6 -13. As can be seen from these spectra, 
there was one main band located at 485 nm in the visible region, which was originated 
from the azo -band chromophore ( N=N) (Wu et al . 2012b ). Meanwhile , the 
absorption at 310 nm and 228 nm in the ultraviolet region were corresponded to 
naphthalene ring and benzene ring structures in the dye molecule (Zhang et al. 200 9). 
As shown in Fig. 6 -13(a), the visible band disappeared as the reaction proceeded, due to 
the fragmentation of the azo links by the reaction. The decay of the absorbance at 310 
nm was considered as evidence of aromatic fragment degradation in the dye  molecule 
and its intermediates. However, the absorbance at 228 nm increased, indicating that the 
azo structure was destroyed and some aromatic fragment such as benzene rings were 
formed.  
In order to investigate the mineralization efficiency of Orange II 
electro/α -FeOOH/peroxydisulfate process, the changes of TOC were observed with 
initial Orange II concentration 50 mg/L, α -FeOOH dosage  0.5 g/L , PDS concentration 2 
g/L, Na 2SO 4 solution concentration 50 mM, initial pH 7.0 and the electrical current 0.5A. 
As can be seen in Fig. 6 -13(b), the TOC removal efficiency was only 12.8% after 120 
min compared with 92.1% of Orange II degradation efficiency. Interestingly, by 
extending the reaction time to 180 min the TOC removal efficiency slightly increased to 
16.7%, indicating most Orange II were converted to more simple intermediate products 
in electro/α -FeOOH/peroxydisulfate process.  133

 electro/α -FeOOH/peroxydisulfate  process. Orange II decolorization efficiency first 
increased with the increase of electrical current, α -FeOOH dosage and PDS 
concentration, then it decreased when electric current, α -FeOOH dosage and PDS 
concentration were further increased. Initial pH va lue has insignificant influence on the 
decolorization of Orange II. ANOV A indicated both the interaction effect and the 
quadratic effect were significant on Orange II decolorization rate. The models were 
significant and could fit the experimental data well .

 7.1 Introduction  
In this part, Orange II was degraded by electrochemical process combined with 
Fe3O4 activated PDS process (EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process). The effect of various reaction 
parameters such as initial pH, current density, PDS concentration and Fe 3O4 dosage on 
the removal of Orange II was investigated. The X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
was applied to investigate the surface properties of Fe 3O4 before and after reaction. Gas 
chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS) was applied to identify the 
intermediates and the degradation pathway of Orange II is pr oposed accordingly. The 
mineralization of Orange II in terms of TOC removal was also investigated.  The change 
of acute toxicity during the treatment was investigated by activated sludge inhibition 
test. 
7.2 Materials and methods  
7.2.1 Materials  
Orange II (4-(2-hydroxynaphthylazo) benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt)  with 
reagent purity grade was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China) 
and used without further purification. Fe3O4 used in this study was from Prolabo Co. 
(Paris, France). Sodium peroxydisulfate (Na 2S2O8, 98%) and anhydrous sodium sulfate 
(Na 2SO 4, 99%) w ere purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, 
China) and of analytical grade.  
7.2.2 Experimen tal 
The experimental set -up used for this study is illustrated in Fig. 7-1. Bulk 
electrolyses were carried out in undivided glass beaker with a capacity of 250 mL. A 
plate mixed metal oxide (DSA, Ti/RuO 2IrO 2) anode (5.0 cm ×  11.9 cm) is served as 
the anod e and a plate of stainless steel with the same dimensions is used as cathode. The 
gap between the electrodes was 4.0 cm. The reactor was immersed in a water bath to 140 
 keep the temperature constant at 25 C. A Model RYI -3010 direct current (DC) power 
supply  from Shenzhen Yizhan Source, Co., Ltd. (China) was employed to provide the 
constant current.  
Before each run, a fresh stock solution of Orange II  was prepared in deionised 
water and the initial concentration ( C0) was kept at 25 mg/L . Sodium sulfate ( 50 mM) 
was added as a background electrolyte. The initial pH (pH 0) of Orange II solutions was 
measured with a Mettler -Toledo FE20 pH -meter (Mettler -Toledo Instruments Co., Ltd., 
Shanghai) and adjusted by sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide. Before the beginning o f 
electrolysis, a certain amount of PDS and Fe 3O4 were added into 200 mL of Orange II 
solution with constant stirring by using a mechanical stirrer (RW 20, IKA, Germany).

7.2.3 Analysis  
The absorbance of Orange II was measured at λ max = 485 nm using a Rayleigh 
UV-9100 spectrophotometer (Rayleigh Co., China). Decolorization efficiency was 
calculated according to Eq. ( 7-1),

where the A 0 and A were the absorbance of the sample at time 0 and t, respectively. The 
concentration of residual PDS was measured by an iodometric titration method (Wahba 
et al. 1959 ). The quantification of the dissolved iron ions concentration in the solution 
141 
 was systematically evaluated by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS, Perkin Elmer 
AAnalyst 800). XPS was operated  on a KRATOS XSAM800 spectrometer equipped 
with MgKα X -ray source. GC MS (V ARIAN 450 GC/320MS) was employed to 
determine the intermediates. Before analysis, Orange II solution was extracted with 
dichloromethane for ten times, and then the extracts were co ncentrated by rotary 
evaporator at 40 C to about 1 mL (Zhong et al. 2011a ; Zhong et al. 2011b ). A VF5 
MS capillary column (30 m length ×  0.25 mm ID ×  0.25 m film thickness) was 
employed for GC separation. The GC equipments were operated in a temperature 
programmed mode with an initial temperature of 35 C held for 2 min, then ramped to 
280 C with a 10 C/min rate. Helium was used as the carrier gas. Electronimpact (EI) 
mass spectra were scanned from 0 to 550 m/z.  
The TOC of the samples were determined by an Analytik Jena Multi N/C 3100 
analyzer with non dispersive infra red absorption detector (NDIR). T he carrier gas was 
oxygen with a flow rate of 158 mL/min. The acute toxicity of intermediates generated 
during the treatment was assessed by means of activated sludge inhibition test 
(Olmez -Hanci et al. 2009 ). The activated sludge used as the heterotroph ic biomass was 
obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment located in Wuhan. The mixed liquor 
suspended solids (MLSS) concentration used in the activated sludge inhibition 
experiments was adjusted to 1800 mg/L. To conduct the activated sludge inhibition  test, 
80 mL activated sludge was aerated 5 min and mixed with 20 mL treated wastewater at 
room temperature. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of the mixed solution was 
measured by HQ30d (HACH) oxygen meter at selected time intervals. Oxygen uptake 
rate (OUR) was measured through the slope of the DO concentration versus time (Wu et 
al. 2012a ): 
OUR = ΔDO/Δt             (7-2) 
Specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) was determined by dividing OUR to the MLSS 
concentration:  
SOUR = OUR/MLSS           (7-3) 
where the MLSS were mea sured by filtration and evaporation the solution at 105 ° C for 
2 h. 142 
 7.3 Results and discussion  
7.3.1 Decolorization  of Orange II under different systems  
To evaluate the decolorization  efficiency of Orange II under different systems, the 
following blank experiments were conducted: Fe 3O4 alone, PDS alone, Fe 3O4/PDS 
process, EC alone, EC/Fe 3O4 process, EC/PDS process and EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process. The 
results are shown in Fig. 7-2a. It can be obviously seen that no appreciable Orange II 
decolorization  was observed when  Fe3O4 was added into the Orange II solution alone, 
indicating the effect of adsorption on Orange II decolorization  was not obvious under 
the condition investigated. Little decolorization also occurred when PDS alone was 
applied. PDS is stable at ambient temperature and its oxidation power was limited ( E0 = 
2.01 V) (Zhao et al. 2010b ; Wu et al. 2012b ), which could hardly degrade Orange II. 
The remaining percentage of PDS after 60 min reaction in the PDS alone process was 
98.0% (Fig. 7-2b), indicating almost no PDS decomposed in this case. The 
concen tration of Orange II was hardly decreased in Fe 3O4/PDS process and the 
remaining percentage of PDS was 90%. This may due to the lack of Fe(II) on the 
surface of Fe 3O4 particles. When treated by EC alone, 61.1% of 25 mg/L Orange II was 
decolorizated due to a certain amount of hydroxyl radicals (M(•OH)) formed as 
intermediate of water discharge on DSA anode (M) (Eq. ( 7-4)) (Özcan et al. 2009 ). 
M(H 2O) → M(•OH) + H+ + e–         (7-4) 
When 0.5 g/L Fe 3O4 was employed to the electrolytic reactor, the decolorization 
efficiency of Orange II increased to 82.8%. It can be explained that in EC/Fe 3O4 process,  
Fe3O4 was used as particle electrodes and could increase mass transfer coefficient and 
reduce energy consumption (Lin et al  2013 ). The decolorization efficiency slightly 
improved to 85.1% in EC/PDS process, which might be attributed to sulfate radicals 
produced via Eq. ( 7-5). 54.4% of PDS was decomposed in this case (Fig. 7-2b).  
S2O82– + e– → SO 4•– + SO 42–           (7-5) 
The decolorization efficiency of Orange II was 93.0% and the remaining 
percentage of PDS was 33.7% in the process of EC/Fe 3O4/PDS, indicating Fe(II) can be 143 
 generated by the cathodic reduction of Fe(III) (Eq. ( 7-6)), thus more sulfate radicals can 
form ed by Fe(II) activating PDS reaction.

 To verify the enhancement of the conversion of Fe(III) into Fe(II) in the process of 
EC/Fe 3O4/PDS, the X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy was applied to characterize Fe 3O4 
before and after reaction. The  domain peak for O 1s at 530.0 eV is characteristic of 
oxygen in a metal oxide (Zhao et al. 2012 ). The peak of Fe 2p spectrum at 710.6 and 
724.4 eV represent  Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, indicated the existence of Fe 3O4 
(Huang et al . 2012 ). As can be seen from Fig. 7-3(a), no significantly change was 
observed about O 1s XPS spectra before and after reaction. Before the reaction, the 
Fe2p 3/2 spectrum fitted to four peaks located at bindi ng energies (BE): 710.2, 711.3, 
712.3 and 714.1 eV (Guo et al. 2010 ; Zhao et al. 2012 ). The peak at 710.2 eV could be 
assigned to the formation of ferrous oxide, where other peaks would be considered as 
the Fe(III) oxide (Fig. 7-3(b)). The ratio of Fe(II)/Fe(III) on the surface of Fe 3O4 
adsorbent increased from 0.75 to 1.09 after 60 min reaction. This implied more Fe(II) 
was generated on the surface of Fe 3O4 particles in the electrochemical reactor (Eq. 
(7-6)).

Based on the results and the literature (Liang et al. 2007 ; Özcan et al. 2009 ; Yan et 
al. 2011 ; Lin et al. 2013 ), the mechanism of EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process was indicated in 
Fig. 7-4. Fe(II) was generated by the reduction and transformation of Fe(III) on the 
surface of Fe 3O4 due to the direct electron transfer (Eq. ( 7-6)), and then Fe(II) activat ed 
PDS to release sulfate radicals via Eq. ( 7-7)). Meanwhile, hydroxyl radicals were 
generated both by water discharge on DSA anode (Eq. ( 7-4)) and the reaction between 
sulfate radicals and H 2O or OH– (Eqs. ( 7-8) and ( 7-9)). Orange II was degraded by both 
sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals.

Fig. 7 -4 Proposed mechanism of EC/ Fe 3O4/PDS process  
The degradation kinetics of different systems was investigated and the results were 
summarized in Table 7-1. It can be seen that the decolorization of 25 mg/L Orange II by 
EC, EC/Fe 3O4, EC/PDS and EC/ Fe3O4/PDS process followed apparent first order 
kinetics and the apparent rate constants ( kapp) were 0.015, 0.028, 0.030 and 0.043 min−1,

7.3.2 Effect of initial pH  
  The effect of initial pH was observed when Orange II concentration was 25 mg/L, 
PDS concentration was 20 mM, Fe 3O4 dosage was 0.5 g/L, Na 2SO 4 solution 
concentration was 50 mM and the electrical density was 8.4 mA/cm2. As can be seen 
from Fig. 7-5, the de colorization efficiencies of Orange II were 93.0%, 91.2% and 92.1% 
at initial pH 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0, respectively. When initial pH ranged from 3.0 to 9.0, the 
rate constants varied slightly from 0.037 to 0.043 min−1 (Table 7-1). Sulfate radicals 
generated in  EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process could react with H 2O or OH– to produce hydroxyl 
radicals (Liang et al . 2007 ; Saien et al . 2011 ). Either H+ could be generat ed or OH– 
could be consumed (Eqs. ( 7-8) and ( 7-9)), which resulted in the reduction of solution 
pH. Moreover, the dissociation of HSO 4− (Eq. ( 7-10)), which was formed through Eq. 
(7-11), would further release H+ and decrease the solution pH (Kusic et al. 2011 ).  
HSO 4− → SO 42− + H+            (7-10) 
SO 4•− + •OH → HSO 4− + 1/2O 2          (7-11) 
Therefore, the pH of Orange II solution after 60 min at different initial pH was 
almost the same (about 2.3). As a result, the decolorization efficiency of Orange II and 
the decomposition of PDS (Table 7-1) were similar at differen t initial pH values. This 148 
 proved that the EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process could be successfully applied at a wide range of 
initial pH from 3.0 to 9.0. Since pH 0 6.0 was the natural pH of 25 mg/L Orange II 
solution, it was selected in the following experiments.  
 
Fig. 7-5 The effect of initial pH on the oxidation efficiency of Orange II (C0 = 25 mg/L, [PDS] = 20 
mM, [Fe 3O4] = 0.5 g/L, j = 8.4 mA/cm2, [Na 2SO 4] = 50 mM)  
7.3.3 Effect of current density  
Fig. 7-6 illustrated the effect of current density with initial Orange  II concentration  
of 25 mg/L, PDS concentration 20 mM, Fe 3O4 dosage 0.5 g/L, Na 2SO 4 solution 
concentration 50 mM and the initial pH 6.0. The decolorization efficiency and apparent 
rate constant were 80.3% and 0.027 min−1 (Table 7-1) in a 60 min reaction when current 
density was 3.4 mA/cm2. When current density increased to 25.2 mA/cm2, the 
decolorization efficiency was nearly 100% in 30 min reaction and the rate constant 
increased to 0.117 min−1 (Table 7-1). On the one hand, when current density increased , 
more hydroxyl radicals would be formed on anode surface (Eq. ( 7-4)) and more sulfate 
radicals would be generated via electron transfer reaction (Eq. ( 7-5)). On the other hand, 
the increase of current density favored the cathodic reduction of Fe(III) (Eq.  (7-6)), and 
more PDS would be activated to generate sulfate radicals via Eq. ( 7-7). Meanwhile, 
Table 7-1 demonstrated that the increase of current density from 3.34 to 25.2 mA/cm2

 did cause the increase of PDS decomposition. This also suggested more sulfa te radicals 
would be generated when current density increased.  
 
Fig. 7 -6 The effect of current density on the oxidation efficiency of Orange II (C0 = 25 mg/L, [PDS] 
= 20 mM, [Fe 3O4] = 0.5 g/L, pH 0 6.0, [Na 2SO 4] = 50 mM)  
7.3.4 Effect of PDS concentration  
As the source of sulfate radicals, PDS plays a significant role in EC/Fe 3O4/PDS 
process. The effect of PDS concentration was investigated by varying the concentration 
of PDS from 5 to 20 mM when Orange II concentration was 25 mg/L, Fe 3O4 dosage 
was 0.5 g/L , Na 2SO 4 solution concentration was 50 mM, initial pH was 6.0 and the 
electrical density was 8.4 mA/cm2. As can be seen from Fig. 7-7, when PDS 
concentration increased from 5 to 10 mM, the Orange II decolorization efficiency and 
apparent rate constants over a 60 min reaction increased from 84.1% to 95.8% and the 
rate constants increased from 0.030 to 0.053 min−1 (Table 7-1). Meanwhile, the amount 
of PDS decomposed also increased, indicating more reactive radicals would be 
generated to degrade Orange II a t higher PDS concentration. When PDS concentration 
increased to 20 mM, the Orange II decolorization efficiency and rate constants after 60 
min declined slightly to 91.2% and 0.039 min−1 (Table 7-1). This was due to the fact 
that the side reaction between S2O82– and SO 4•− became more significant (Eq. ( 7-12))

S2O82– + SO 4•– → S2O8•– + SO 42–            (7-12) 
Therefore, 10 mM  was selected as the optimal initial PDS concentration and used 
in the following experiments.  
 
Fig. 7 -7 The effect of  PDS concentration on the oxidation efficiency of Orange II (C0 = 25 mg/L, 
[Fe 3O4] = 0.5 g/L, pH 0 6.0, j = 8.4 mA/cm2, [Na 2SO 4] = 50 mM ) 
7.3.5 Effect of Fe3O4 dosage  
The comparison of Orange II decolorization efficiency under different Fe 3O4 
dosage was investigated with initial Orange II concentration 25 mg/L, PDS 
concentration 10 mM, Na 2SO 4 solution concentration 50 mM, the initial pH 6.0 and the 
electrical density 8.4 mA/cm2. The results were shown in Fig. 7-8. When Fe 3O4 dosage 
varied from 0.2 to 0.8 g/L, the decolorization efficiency of Orange II within 60 min 
reaction increased from 83.9% to 97.6% and apparent rate constants increased f rom 
0.029 to 0.057 min−1 (Table 7-1). At higher Fe 3O4 dosage, more Fe(II) could be 
generated through Eq. ( 7-5), and then a considerable amount of sulfate radicals would 
be produced via Eq. ( 7-6). These sulfate radicals reacted immediately with Orange II, 
leading to a fast increase of the Orange II decolorization. When Fe 3O4 dosage further 
increased to 1.2 g/L, the Orange II decolorization efficiency declined slightly to 96.0%

 and appaent  rate constants decreased to 0.049 min−1 (Table 7-1). When Fe 3O4 partic les 
were added in excess, an excess of sulfate radicals would be generated, resulting in 
considerable disappearance of sulfate radicals without the degradation of Orange II due 
to the combination between sulfate radicals themselves (Eq. ( 7-13)). Moreover, the 
interaction between excess Fe(II) on the surface of Fe 3O4 particles and sulfate radicals 
might directly quench sulfate radicals via Eq. ( 7-14) (Yan et al. 2011 ). 
SO 4•− + SO 4•− → 2SO 42−           (7-13) 
≡Fe(II)  + SO 4•– → ≡Fe(III)  + SO 42–        (7-14) 
As a result, the decomposition of PDS increased with an increase in Fe 3O4 dosage 
of up to 0.8 g /L (Table 7-1), and the highest decolorization efficiency of Orange II was 
obtained at Fe 3O4 dosage of 0.8 g/L. This value was chosen as the optimal Fe 3O4 dosage 
and applied in the following experiments.  
 
Fig. 7 -8 The effect of  Fe3O4 dosage  on the oxidation efficiency of Orange II (C0 = 25 mg/L, [PDS] = 
10 mM, pH 0 6.0, j = 8.4 mA/cm2, [Na 2SO 4] = 50 mM ) 
7.3.6 Stability of Fe 3O4  
The recycle experiments were performed to investigate the stability of Fe 3O4. The 
solid was easily removed from the electrochemical reactor after each repetitive 
oxidation process, then washed by deionised  water, dried in the vacuum oven and stored

 at ambient temperature. The initial concentration of Orange II solution was fixed a t 25 
mg/L, PDS concentration was 10 mM, Fe 3O4 dosage was 0.8 g/L, Na 2SO 4 solution 
concentration was 50 mM, initial pH was 6.0 and the electrical density was 8.4 mA/cm2. 
As shown in Fig. 7-9a, the decolorization  efficiencies of Orange II during three reacti on 
cycles ranged from 98.0% to 95.3%. The remaining percentages of PDS in each recycle 
experiment were similar (Fig. 7-9b). The metal leaching level was not obviously 
changed after three recycle time, with a Fe content in the solution at the end of the tes t 
almost constant at 13.05 -32.72 mg/L. This indicated Fe 3O4 is stable and can be reused.

7.3.7 The degradation pathway of Orange II  
GCMS was employed to identify the intermediate products formed during 
EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process. The main intermediate products detected were illustrated in 
Table 7-2 and a plausible degradation pathway was proposed (Fig. 7-10) based on the 
results and previous studies (Özcan et al. 2009 ; Zhao et al. 2010a ; Zhong et al. 2011b ). 
The cleavage of –N=N – of Orange II caused by electron transfer of sulfate radicals 
(Yuan et al . 2011 ) leads to the formation of sodium sulfanilamide and 
1-amino -2-naphthol. Sodium sulfanilamide is thermally stable and highly soluble in 
water, whereas 1 -amino -2-naph thol is oxygen sensitive and may be decomposed under 
aerobic conditions (Zhao et al. 2010a ; Zhong et al. 2011b ). Therefore , neither of these 
two intermediates was detected during GC MS analysis. Afterwards, sodium 
sulfanilamide was subsequently oxidized to 1,4 -benzoquinone (A). 1 -amino -2-naphthol 
was firstly oxidized to 1,2 -naphthalenedione (B). 1,2 -naphthalenedione (B) was 
subsequently oxidized to the quinoid structures, resulting in the formation of 
1(3H) -isobenzofuranone (C), phthalic anhydride (D), methyl hydrogen phthalate (E) 
and 2 -(hydroxymethyl) benzoic acid (F) (Özcan et al. 2009 , Zhao et al. 2010a )[1,50]. 
Further oxidation resulted in aromatic ring cleavage and generation of carboxylic acids 
and finally converted to CO 2 and H 2O.

7.3.8 The changes of TOC and toxicity with reaction time  
In order to clarify the mineralization efficiency of  Orange II in EC/Fe 3O4/PDS 156 
 process, the changes of TOC were investigated with initial Orange IIconcentration 25 
mg/L, PDS concentration 10 mM, Fe 3O4 dosage 0.8 g/L, Na 2SO 4 solution concentration 
50 mM, initial pH value 6.0 and the current density 16.8 mA/cm2. As can be seen in Fig. 
7-11, Orange II was almost completely removed after a 60 min reaction, but the TOC 
removal efficiency was only 19.6%. Further prolong of reaction time to 90 min, the 
TOC removal efficiency achieved 30.0%. This indicated part of Orange II was 
converted to smaller intermediates. The variation of acute toxicity in EC/Fe 3O4/PDS 
process was monitored by oxygen uptake (Olmez -Hanci et al. 2009 ; Olmez -Hanci et al. 
2010 ,). As indicated in Fig. 7-11, the SOUR value decreased at the beginning of the 
reaction, indicating more toxic products were generated. It has been illustrated in 
Section 7.3.7 that the main intermediates formed at the  early stage of the treatment are 
1,4-benzoquinone (A) and 1,2 -naphthalenedione (B). Therefore, the higher toxicity 
observed at the beginning of EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process can be attributed to the formation 
of these intermediates, because the toxicity of quinone s is well -known (Hammami et al. 
2008 ). After 30 to 9 0 min reaction, the value of SOUR increased gradually. This means 
further treatment could convert these intermediates to less toxic products and 
mineralization led to the detoxification of treated solution.

 7.3.9 Electrical energy consumption estimation  
In order to evaluate the energy consumption of EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process, an 
electrical energy consumption per order of magnitude (EE/O) was employed. EE/O is 
defined as the number of kilowatt hours of electrical energy required for bringing about 
the degradation of a pollutant by one order of magnitude (90%) in 1 m3 of contaminated 
water (Daneshvar et al. 2007 ; Sadik 2007a ; Sadik 2007 b; Behnajady et al. 2009 ). 
EE/O (kWh m-3 order−1) = 
0 log( / )cellU It
V A A      (7-15) 
where Ucell is the average cell voltage (V), I is the current (A), t is the electrolysis time 
(h) and V is the volume (L).  
The electrical energy consumption for Orange II degradation under different 
reaction systems were summarized in Table 7-3. It can be seen from Table 7-3 that the 
electrocatalysis processes were more energy saving than the photocatalysis processes. 
For example, EE/O value was 273.9 (kWh m-3 order−1) for UV/TiO 2 process, while 
EC/Fe3O4 process only needed 19.65 (kWh m-3 order−1) electrical energy consumption. 
What’s more, the presence of oxidant (H 2O2 or PDS) could improve electrocatalysis and 
photocatalysis, and the associated electrical energy consumption decreased. Table 4 
indicated that the EE/O value of EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process was less than one -half of EC/ 
Fe3O4 process.

7.4 Conclusions  
Aqueous solutions of Orange II  have been degraded effectively in the 
EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process, in which Fe 3O4-activated PDS process is enhanced by the 
electrochemical process. The effect of initial pH, current density, PDS concentration and 
Fe3O4 dosage, on the Orange  II decolorization was investigated. The results indicated 
that Orange II can be totally decolorizated in a 60 min reaction when initial Orange II 
concentration was 25 mg/L, PDS concentration was 10 mM, Fe 3O4 dosage was 0.8 g/L, 
current density was 8.4 mA/ cm2 and initial pH was 6.0. Recycle experiments showed 
Fe3O4 particles were stable and can be reused. XPS spectrum indicated Fe(II) was 
generated on the surface of Fe 3O4 particles after reaction. The main intermediates were 
separated and identified by GC MS technique and a plausible degradation pathway of 
Orange II was proposed.

 8.1 General conclusion  
In this paper, elect ro-Fenton and electro -Fenton -like processes were used to 
degrade artificial sweeteners and azo dye s. The results obtained during this thesis work  
concern the removal efficiency, the oxidation mechanism , degradation pathway and 
toxicity evolution of target pollutants.  
(1) Electro -Fenton process was a effective method for the degradation of ASP in 
water. The oxidative degradation  rate and mineralizat ion efficiency  were  affected 
mainly by the catalyst ( Fe2+) concentration and applied current. The absolute rate 
constant of hydroxylation reaction of ASP was found as to be (5.23  ±  0.02)  ×  109 M–1 s–
1. Short -chain aliphatic acids such as oxalic, oxamic and maleic acid were  identified as 
aliphatic intermediates in the electro -Fenton process . The bacteria luminescence 
inhibition  showed the toxicity of ASP solution decreased , during the treatment, after 
reached a maximum during the first period of the oxidation reaction . 
(2) Artificial sweetener SAC could be degraded effectively by electro -Fenton 
process with a DSA, Pt or BDD anode. However, the using of BDD anode could 
accelerate the mineralization of SAC. The optimal conditions for SAC r emoval were 
SAC concentration 0.2 mM, Fe2+ concentration 0.2 mM, Na 2SO 4 concentration 50 mM, 
applied current 200 mA and initial pH 3.0.  Oxalic, formic , and maleic acids  were 
observed  as aliphatic by -products  of SAC during electro -Fenton process. The bacteria 
luminescence inhibition  showed the toxicity of SAC  solution increased at the beginning 
of electrolysis, and then it declined until the end of the reaction.  
(3) Artificial sweetener SUC  could be completely mineralized in a 360 min 
reaction by elect ro-Fenton process with a Pt or BDD anode. The mineralization rate was 
affected mainly by the Fe2+ concentration and applied current. The mineralization 
current efficiency (MCE) decreased with rising applied current from 100 to 500 mA 
with both Pt and BDD anode s. Oxalic, pyruvic,  formic  and glycolic acids were detected 
during the oxidation of SUC .  
(4) Orange II was effectively decoloriz ed by EC/α-FeOOH/ PDS process. The 
initial pH  of Orange II solution had little effect on the decolorization of Orange II . RSM  164 
 based on Box -Behnken statistical experiment design was applied to analyze the 
experimental variables. The response surface methodology models were derived based 
on the results of the pseudo -first-order decolorization  rate kinetics and the response 
surface plots were developed accordingly.  The results indicated that the applied current 
showed a positive effect on the decolorization  rate constant  of Orange II. The 
interaction of α-FeOOH dosage and PDS concentration were  significant. The ANOVA 
results confirmed that the proposed models were accurate and reliable for the analysis of 
the varibles of EC/α-FeOOH/PDS process. The catalyst α-FeOOH showed good 
structural stability and could be reused.  
(5) Aqueous solutions of Or ange II  have been degraded effectively in the 
EC/Fe 3O4/PDS process. The decolorization  rate was affected by the initial pH  of Orange 
II solution , current density, PDS concentration and Fe 3O4 dosage. Orange II can be 
totally decolorized in a 60 min reaction time when initial Orange II concentration was 
25 mg/L, PDS concentration was 10 mM, Fe 3O4 dosage was 0.8 g/L, current density 
was 8.4 mA/cm2 and initial pH was 6.0. Recycle experiments show ed that Fe 3O4 
particles were stable and can be reused. XPS spectrum indicated that Fe(II) was 
generated on the surface of Fe 3O4 particles after reaction. The main reaction 
intermediates of Orange II were separated and identified by GC MS technique and a  
plausible degradation pathway  was proposed.  
8.2 Future p erspectives  
Further studies can be developed as follows:  
 (1) Finding out the suitable method to detect the intermediate products of 
artificial sweeteners and then obtain the degradation pathway;  
(2) In the sulfate radical -based electro -Fenton -like process, persufate is remained 
in the solution after the reaction. Moreover, persulfate can be decomposed to SO 4 and 
H+, resulting the decline of the pH value. So it is important to separate persulfate and  
SO 4 from the treated solution.  
(3) Both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals are contributed to the degradation 165 
 of organic contaminants in the sulfate radical -based electro -Fenton -like process. When 
attacking organic compounds, hydroxyl radicals are  more likely to do through hydrogen 
abstraction or addition reactions,  while sulfate radicals participate in electron transfer 
reaction . Therefore, further investigation can focus on the different by -products 
generated under the attack of these two radicals.  
(4) All the solutions contained organic pollutants are synthetic  wastewater s which were  
prepared in the lab. In the future, we can use eletro -Fenton and sulfate radical -based 
electro -Fenton -like processes to degrade target pollutants in actural wastewater .
