ABSTRACT : India is the fourth largest producer of ethanol in the world and second largest in Asia. The distill eries 
using Molasses for the production of alcohol, is considered as one of the most polluting industries.  Different 
technologies covering anaerobic , aerobic, composting, concentration and incineration with energy recovery, reverse 
osmosis etc. have been followed by Indian distilleries to treat spent wash to achieve a complete sol ution. But no system 
or strategy till date is ideal to deliver a complet e solution with respect to zero discharge, as well as return on investment 
and water conservation associated with the processes.  
Looking into that angle, this paper is being presented as a review of the problems associated with d ifferent treatment 
strategi es and prospect of decolourisation by capillary seepage system through immobilized whole cells incor porated in 
artificial soil bed with a designed novel system which would deliver zero discharge with good ROI th rough crop 
cultivation.

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
India produces about 3.25 million kiloliters (KL) of alcohol annually from 319 distilleries, generat e approximately 404 
million KL waste w ater (Uppal, 2004). Due to increasing demand of potable alcohol and the use of alcohol as blend in 
motor fuel (gasohol) there will be drastic increase in demand for ethanol which could overcome the e xisting unutilized 
capacity and hence creating an excess demand. Distillery spent wash is a potential water pollutant in two ways: First, it 
has a high organic and inorganic load which would result in eutrophication of contaminated water sou rces (Fitz Gibbon 
et al., 1998). Second, it has dark chocolate colour af ter biomethanation which can block out sunlight from rivers and 
streams thus reducing oxygenation of water by photosynthesis and hence becomes detrimental to aquati c life. 
Moreover, it also contaminates the ground water level through percolation as a resul t tube well water in villages 
become unfit for drinking.  In addition to pollution, increasing stringent environmental regulations are forcing 
distilleries to find out a complete solution that cannot be provided by existing spent wash treatmen t options of e ffluent 
management. Moreover, Indian distilleries are bound to achieve zero discharge of spent wash as well as water 
conservation.  
This review article focuses on the advances in distillery waste water treatment in the last two and half decades  and the 
emer ging technologies in this field. However, there are limitations posed by these technologies for full  compliance. 
Many physico -chemical and biological methods for the decolourisation of distillery waste water tried , but an efficient

cultivation is still need of the hour.  
 
II. GROWTH OF INDIAN DISTILLERIES  
 
The first distillery was set up at Crwnpore (Kanpur) in 1805 by Carew & Co. Ltd., for manufacture of  Rum for the 
army. The technique of fermentation, distillation and blending of the alcoholic beverage was develop ed in India on 
the lines of practices adopted overseas particularly in Europe. Distilleries manufacture rectified s pirit and extra neutral 
alcohol  for human consumption and denatured spirit for industrial purpose.  
The distillery industry today consists the industrial alcohol and potable liquor. The potable distil lery producing Indian 
made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and country liquor has a growth rate of  about 7 -10 percent per annum whereas the 
industrial alcohol industry on the other hand is showing a declining trend because of high price of molasses. The 
alcohol produced is now being utilized in the ratio of approximately 52 percent for potable and the balance 48 percent 
for industrial use. Apart from its use as beverage, medicinal, pharmaceutical and flavouring, alcoho l constitute the 
feedstock of large number of organic chemicals which are used in manufacturing a wide variety of int ermediates like 
drug, rubber, pesticides, solvents etc. (Mall, 1995). With the advent of ethanol blending with petrol/mo tor fuel, the 
requirement of ethanol/industrial alcohol has increased manifold in the country to the extent that i n case 5% blending, if 
made mandatory all over the country, the sugar factory molasses available in the country shall not be adequate for 
meeting the total requirements of ethanol including its use for potable liquor and other industrial uses. 
However, the notification no. G.S.R 705 (E) dated 27th October, 2004, Ministry of petroleum and Natural Gas, 
Government of India, mandates that 5% ethanol blended petrol (E5), conforming to bureau of Indian st andards 
specifications, shall be sold in the following ten states viz. Andhra Pradesh (except Chitto r and Nellor districts); Goa; 
Gujrat; Haryana; Karnataka; Maharashtra; Punjab; Tamil Nadu (only in districts of Coimbatore, Dindig ul, Erode, 
Kanyakumari, Nillgiri, Ramanathpuram, Tirunelveli, Tuticorn and Virudhnagar); Uttar Pradesh and Utta ranchal and the  
following three Union territories viz. Daman and Diu; Dadra and Nagar Haveli; and Chandigarh. It is also stipulated that 
government may extend above notification to all states and Union territories in phase 2, and enhance  the percentage of 
ethanol in the ethanol blended petrol from 5% to 10% in phase 3 (MoPNG, 2004). Due to government promoting ethanol 
to mix in petrol there will be drastic demand for ethanol, which could overcome the existing unutili zed capacity and thus 
creating an excess demand. For exa mple, according to the estimates prepared by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural 
Gas, about 410 million liters of anhydrous ethanol (conforming to IS 321: 1964) shall be required to  implement 5% 
blending in the above mentioned 10 notified states (Ethanol  India, 2008). Looking to its wide use, it can be inferred that 
the demand for alcohol is likely to increase in the country. All India Distillers Association (AIDA)  and Ethanol India 
predicting the birth of many new distilleries along with the major expans ion in capacity of existing distilleries (AIDA, 
2008; Ethanol India, 2008).  
 
III. WASTEWATER (SPENT WASH) FROM DISTILLERY  
 
Distilleries generate  (i) Spent wash from the bottom of the analyser column (ii) Spent lees from the bottom of the    
rectification  column  after separation  of alcohol  and column  after separation  of alcohol  and (iii)  waste wat er
generated from bottling,  fermentation tank cooling, washing and utility section of the plant. Among these,  spent wash is 
of major environmental concern due to its qua ntity and quality. About 10 -15 litre of spent wash is generated for every 
litre of alcohol produced and is characterized by high percentage of dissolved organic (BOD: 52,000 -58,000 mg/L; COD: 
90,000 -1,20,000 mg/L) and inorganic matter (1,660 -4,200 mg/L for m of nitrogen, 225 -3,038 mg/L of phosphorous, 
9,600 -17,475 mg/L potassium, 400 -1,500 mg/L sodium, 2,000 -6,000 mg/L Calcium, 5,000 -7,500 mg/L chlorides and 
4,000 -8,500 mg/L sulphates), dark brown colour (2,38,000 -2,52,00 Pt -Co units), high temperature (70 -1000C) and low 
pH (4.5 -5.5). About 50% of the organic and inorganic matter are present as reducing sugars. The properties o f Spent 
wash being dependent on the quality of molasses, fermentation process and operating conditions, coul d be the main 
reason for t he significant variability. Spent wash is toxic to aquatic organisms as LC50 value for distillery sp ent wash is 
found to be 0.5% for fresh water fish like Cyprinus carpio  var. communis  (Gupta, 2007). If disposed untreated on the 
soil, it reduces alkalinity  of the soil, and crops may be destroyed. Moreover, the colour problem in groundwater is so

acute that distilleries have to provide potable water in the nearby villages. It behaves much more h azardous when 
disposed into water bodies, because of complete de pletion of dissolved oxygen as a result aquatic life is destroyed 
(Kumar, 1991). Anaerobic treatment of spent wash has been favoured over aerobic treatment because of  various 
advantages. Biomethanation plants which generates biogas (methane 60 -65% v/v), is  used to run boilers for power 
generation, reduces power consumption of sugar factory remarkably. The payback period of most of the  plant is less than 
3 years. Therefore, almost all Indian distilleries have adopted it as the best available technology at the first step.  
The effluent  standards notified by Ministry of Environment & Forest (MOEF), Govt. of India vide GSR 176(E), April  
2, 1996, require that the effluent should have pH between 5.5 -9, suspended solids 100mg/L, and maximum BOD level 
of 30mg/L for  disposal into water courses and 100mg/L for disposal in land. It is suggested that all efforts must be done 
to remove colour and unpleasant odour, as far as possible. If land application is envisaged as secon dary treatment, BOD 
is allowed upto 500 -1000mg/ L. However, the drainage water from the land after such treatment has to satisfy BOD 
limit of 30mg/L and nitrate as nitrogen should not be more than 10mg/L. Further, the underlying grou ndwater should 
not have a BOD more than 3mg/L and 10mg/L nitrate (CPCB,  2002).  
 
To make and ensure the environment most cleaner and eco -friendly CPCB/MOEF issued “Charter of corporate 
Responsibility for Environment Protection (CREP)” for each of the 17 highly polluting industries. Ac cordingly, 
existing molasses based noncompl iance distilleries are required to furnish bank guarantee and action plan to 
concerned state boards to ensure compliance with any or combination of the following measures:  
• Compost making with press -mud / agricultural residue / municipal waste.  
• Concentratio n and drying / Incineration.  
• Treatment of spent wash through bio -methanation followed by two stage secondary treatment and 
dilution of treated effluent with process water for irrigation as per norms prescribed by CPCB/MOEF.  
• Treatment of spent wash through bio-methanation followed by secondary treatment (BOD<2500 mg/L) 
for controlled discharge into the sea through a proper submerged marine outfall at a point  permitte d by 
SPCB/CPCB in consultation with National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), so that the dis solved oxygen 
in the mixing zone does not deplete, less  than 4 mg/L.  
• For taking decision on the feasibility of one -time controlled land application of treated effluent a study 
will be undertaken within three months.  
The road map for the utilization of spen t wash by distilleries to achieve zero discharge in inland surface water 
courses will be as below:  
 50% utilization of spent wash:  By March  2004.  
 75% utilization of spent wash:  By March  2005.  
 100% utilization of spent wash: By December  2005.  
 
Till 100% ut ilization of spent wash is achieved, controlled and restricted discharge of treated effluent from li ned 
lagoons during rainy seasons will be allowed by SPCB/CPCB in such a way that the perceptible colouri ng of river 
water bodies does not occur. Moreover, t he task force consisting of CPCB, SPCB, experts and industry shall be 
constituted for monitoring and implementation of action plan. For new distilleries and expansion of existing 
distilleries (molasses based), the proposal without achieving zero discharge in surface water/ ground water will not 
be considered by MOEF/SPCB (CPCB, 2008).  
 
IV. TREATMENT OPTIONS: RELATED PROBLEMS  
 
1. Biomethanation followed by irrigatio n 
Biomethanation is a well -established process and is the best possible technical option for the trea tment at the first step.  
This is capable of treating spent wash having BOD in the range o f 
     (55,000 -58,000) with an efficiency of 90 -95%, thus producing an effluent having a BOD equal to 5,000 -5,800  mg/L  
The treatment systems produce gas at the rate o f 0.4 -0.5m3/kg COD removed having a composition of 55 -65% (v/v) 
methane, 35 -45% (v/v) carbon -dioxide and 1 -1.5% (v/v) hydrogen sulphide. The gas is used as a source of energy by

the industry for generating steam. Comparing the effluent quality with the pre scribed effluent standards it is seen that 
the treated effluent must be diluted if it has to be used for irrigation. In order to meet the stand ard of 100mg/L BOD, the 
required dilution would be about 45 -50 times the effluent volume. The rate of dilution wo uld also result in lowering the 
inorganic dissolved salts concentration to an acceptable level. Considering the large requirement of  dilution water, such 
an alternative cannot be acceptable. Further in most cases there would also be a restriction of the availability of suitable 
land area.  
 
2. Bio-methanation and secondary treatment followed by irrigation or disposal in surface water  
In order to reduce the requirement of dilution water to meet the prescribed standards, a secondary b iological treatment 
process i s used.  
The activated sludge process, trickling filters, extended aeration etc. are the most commonly used s econdary treatment 
systems adopted. But such systems are capable of reducing the BOD level to about 500 -800mg/L. Moreover, the 
process is energy int ensive with no return on investment. Power requirement for the aeration process is directly 
proportional to the BOD removed.  
Assuming the BOD of the final effluent from the aerobic treatment as 500 -700mg/L, it will be diluted in the  ratio 
to 1:5 -7 for BOD,  for application in land for irrigation. In case t he water is to be disposed in inland surface 
water, effort should be made to treat the effluent a BOD level of at least 300 -500 mg/L. In such a case, the 
required dilution would be 10 to 15 times to meet th e standard of 30mg/L BOD.  
Even if 30 mg/L BOD is achieved by dilution, the problem of colour would still persist . 
 
3. Composting, after or without Bio -methanation  
The composting process consists of converting the spent wash into useful manure. This is done w ith the help of 
specialized microbial culture or using fresh compost as seed for the microorganisms. The raw materia ls required for 
composting are spent wash, bacterial culture and filler material. The most common filler material is  press -mud 
obtained from  sugar factories. Other options are agricultural residue such as bagasse, segregated municipal waste 
and ash.  
Composting should be carried out on an impervious floor and lined pits. The composting and storage a rea should be 
raised or protected by bunds so that the surface run off during rainy season does not wash off any of the spent wash 
and lead to any contamination of ground water and surface drains.  
Success of the process is dependent on the availability of press mud from sugar factories or any oth er su itable filler 
material. For a 30KLPD distillery generating 400 -450 KLPD spent wash, about 180 T press mud would be required. 
In general, press mud produced in a sugar mill is about 4% of sugarcane crushed and the capacity of the mill would 
be 4500T of suga rcane per day.  
Since the operation of sugar mills is seasonal (5 -6 months) and distilleries run on an average 300 days  per year, 
arrangements for alternative source of filler material or an alternate spent wash treatment is requi red. Availability 
of bagass e as an alternate source of filler materia l
does not arise on the basis of net energy balance compared to cogeneration. On the other hand, insta llation of single 
or multiple stage reboilers to concentrate spent wash is not a wise proposition on the basis o f energy consumption. 
Moreover, land availability for composting is another problem.  
 
4.  Concentration and incineration with energy recovery  
Concentration or drying the spentwash and burning it with auxiliary fuel (bagasse and coal), with en ergy recovery in 
the form of steam, is the most attractive alternative as it leaves a small amount of residue which c ould also be used 
as fertilizer. However, experience with continuously operating full scale plant is not yet available  (CPCB, 2002). 
Moreover, economics for  evaporation plus drying of spent wash shows a net burden of more than 53 percent of total 
revenue generation per liter of alcohol production for a 60 KLPD distillery capacity generating powe r by co -
generation (Bandyopadhyay, 2004). The problems associated  with this system are:  
 
  Corrosion and scaling of evaporator surfaces are very acute.  
 The fly ash poses serious problems mainly itching and health hazards like respiratory disease.

 Loss of alcohol production due to stoppage of boiler for 4 hr./day for clea ning the evaporator.  
 Combustion process needs attention in terms of quality spray, air injection, mixing pattern, tempera ture, 
  profile, pressure drop, the handling of heavy ash etc. (Venkateshwaran, 1987; Panda and Panda, 1991) . 
 
So, after critical and thorough analysis of different options practiced for the treatment of spent wash the various 
problems which are  still remaining  are as follows:  
 
 Treated spent wash does not meet BOD level as per CPCB norms.  
 To attain that norm, huge amount of dilution wate r is required. Hence, possibility of ground water depletion . 
 Does not focus on water conservation.  
 Besides biomethanation all other secondary and tertiary treatment plant are energy extensive and no return on 
investment.  
 Possibility of ground water contami nation in case of composting and surface disposal.  
 Land requirement is high.  
 Problem of colour still persisting.  
Therefore, decolourisation of anaerobically digested spent wash (ADSW) is the ultimate solution to o vercome all these 
problems mentioned above.  
 
Biological and physicochemical methods are the two main approaches for colour removal of spent wash.  
Physicochemical processes have many disadvantages, such as : 
 
 Economic constraints.  
 Technical reasons of process scale up in case of electrocoagulation, e lectrode system and sonication.  
 Enormous chemical consumption in case of precipitation.  
 Low colour removal efficiency is very common in many cases with high volume of solid waste left behi nd 
(in adsorption) leading to secondary pollutant generation.  
 Operat ional stability.  
 
Whereas, biological treatment with microbial biodegradation/decolourisation methods are advantageous  and becoming 
attractive because of following reasons:  
 
• They are environment friendly.  
• Non-specific.  
• Wide range of operation and they are  cost competitive alternatives to chemical methods (Mossvi et al., 
2005; Nwuche and Ugoji et al., 2010).  
 
Therefore, biological treatment is preferable.  
 
V. COLOUR REMOVAL OF SPENT WASH BY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM  
 
1. Colourants in spent wash  
Spent wash has dark bro wn colour and objectionable odour . The dark brown colour becomes darker (like chocolate 
colour) after biomethanation followed by secondary treatment. This dark colour is due to the presenc e of brown 
polymers called melanoidins which are formed by the Maill ard amino carbonyl reaction taking place between the 
amino and carbonyl groups in organic substances (Wedzicha and Kaputo, 1992). Spent wash is believed to resemble 
humic acid in its properties (Ivarson and Benzing -purdie, 1987). These compounds are highly  recalcitrant and have 
antioxidant properties, which render them toxic to many microorganisms, typically present in wastewa ter treatment 
processes (Kitts et al., 1993).

Phenolics (tannic and humic acid from the feedstock), melanoidins from maillard reactio n of sugars (carbohydrates) 
with proteins (amino groups), caramels from overheating sugars and furfurals from acid hydrolysis ma inly contribute to 
the dark brown colour of spent wash (Kort, 1979). During heat treatment, the maillard reaction (non -enzymatic  
reaction) take s place accompanied by formation of a class of compounds, known as Maillard products. The reaction 
proceeds effectively at less than 500C and is favoured at a pH 4 to 7 (Morales and Jimnez -perez, 2001). Melanoidins 
are one of the final produ cts of the maillard reaction. They are complex compounds with their structure not fully 
understood. The basic structure of melanoidins is presented in fig. -1.

The molecular weight distribution is between 5000 and 40,000. It consists of acidic, polymeric and highly dispersed 
colloids, which are negatively charged due to the dissociation of carboxylic acids and phenolic grou ps 
(Manishankar, Rani and Vishwanathan, 2004).  
Caramel is formed by Carameliz ation process. Caramelization occurs when sugars are heated in the absence of nitrogen 
containing compounds. During a Caramelization reaction, the sugar first undergoes dehydration and th en condensation 
or polymerization into complex molecules. Lightly col oured, pleasant testing caramel flavors are produced during 
initial stages, but as the reaction continues, higher molecular weight bodies are produced which are more bi tter 
(Yaylyan and Kaminsky, 1998).  
 
2. Microbial decolourisation  
Microbial degradation and decolourisation of industrial wastes is an environment friendly and cost competitive 
alternative to chemical decomposition process of waste minimization (Mohana et al., 2007; Pant and A dholeya, 2007). 
The degradation of various toxic and recalcitrant c ompounds present in industrial waste is measured in terms of 
decrease in absorbance at a particular wavelength corresponding to the compounds, bacterial growth, increase in 
biomass and reduction in colour intensity. However, the waste water released from d istilleries is highly acidic in nature 
and has a variety of recalcitrant colouring compounds as melanoidins, phenolics and metal sulphides responsible for the 
dark colour having high inhibitory and anti -microbial activity (Dahiya et al., 2001b), slow down the anaerobic 
digestion process of distillery spent wash. The pH of spent wash increases from 4.8 to 8.0 during an aerobic treatment 
process. Many workers have isolated several aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative bacterial strains an d studied the 
degradatio n and decolourisation of anaerobically treated spent wash by these organisms in terms of decrease in  
absorbance at 475 nm, growth at 620nm, increase in mass and reduction in colour intensity (Ramesh Ku mar et al., 
2017; Santal et al., 2016, Sankaran et. al. , 2015; Mohana et al., 2007, Adikane et al., 2006; Kumar and Chandra, 2006).

concentration of distillery waste, which were able to reduce COD by 80%  in 4-5 days without aeration and the major 
products left after the degradation process were biomass, carbon dioxide and volatile acids. Pseudomonas fluorescence 
decolourised melanoidin present in wastewater upto 76% under  non-sterile conditions and upto 9 0% in sterile samples 
(Dahiya et al., 2001a) and this difference in decolourisation might be due to the fact that melanoid in stability varies 
with pH and temperature and at higher temperature during sterilization melanoidins decompose to low molecular 
weig ht compounds (Ohomomo et al., 1987). Sirianuntapiboon et al., 2004 used an acetogenic bacterium to o btain a 
decolourisation yield of 76.4 % under optimal nutrient condition. Ghosh et al., (2004) have also iso lated bacterial 
strains capable of degrading rec alcitrant compounds from soil of effluent discharge site which were Pseudomonas, 
Enterobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Aeromonas, Acinetobacter and Klebseilla , all of which could carry out degradation 
of biomethanated spentwash and maximum 44% COD reduction was achieved using these bacterial strains either singly 
or collectively.  
Several types of fungi have been used for the decolourisation of melanoidins in connection with colo ur removal of 
waste water from the distilleries (Thakkar et al., 2006; Raghukumar et al., 2004; Angayarkanni et al., 2003; 
Raghukumar et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 1998; Miranda et al., 1996). The larger molecular weight frac tions of 
melanoidin were decolourised rapidly, while the smaller molecular weight fractions remained in solut ion and 
metabolized slowly. The decolourisation was less in sterilized spent wash than in non -sterile condition. The decrease in 
colour removal efficiency might be due to the fact that the effluent taken for the study was alkalin e (pH 8.5) and 
melanoidins responsib le for colour were more soluble in the alkaline pH. In the acidic pH, the melanoidins might be 
precipitated and removed easily. It was suggested that decolourisation by fungi takes place due to t he destruction of 
coloured molecules and partially because of  sorption phenomena. Microbial decolourisation of melanoidins is due to 
two decomposition mechanisms, in the first, the smaller molecular weight melanoidins are attacked an d in the second, 
the larger molecular weight melanoidins  are attacked (Ohomomo et al ., 1985b). Under nutrient limiting conditions, 
fungal cells generally cannot remain active during a long -term cultivation. Therefore, the continuous culture method is 
not practical, and the semi batch method can be an alternative for long -term cultivation.  
 
3.  Role of enzymes in melanoidin degradation  
The enzymatic system related to decolourisation of melanoidins is yet to be completely understood an d it seems greatly 
connected with fungal ligninolytic mechanisms. Several studies regarding degradation of melanoidins, humic acid and 
related compounds using basidiomycetes have also suggested the participation of different categories  of enzymes as 
Watanabe et al., (1982) have reported. The enzymatic degradation of melanoidins by Coriolus sp . No. 20 having an 
intracellular enzyme required oxygen molecules and sugars in  reaction mixture. The enzyme was later identified as 
Sorbose oxidase. The purified enzyme aerobically decolourised the melanoidin pigments in presence of  glucose, 
sorbose, galactose, xylose and m altose. But maximum activity was observed with sorbose as well as glucose.  
Melanoidins were suggested to be decolourised by the active oxygen (O2-, H2O2) species produced by the reactions 
catalyzed by enzymes probably oxidases because the reactions with pu re enzyme was accompanied by the oxidation of 
glucose into gluconic acid.  
Aoshima et al., (1985) reported that melanoidins decolourisation activity of Coriolus  versicolor Ps4a was mainly due 
to intracellular enzyme that are induced by melanoidins. The  induced enzymes consisted of two components, namely 
sugar dependent enzymes forming two third part and other sugar independent part constituting one thi rd part of system. 
The sugar dependent enzyme might be same as that of sorbose oxidase as reported by Watanb e et al., (1982) or a same 
type of sugar oxidase and this was the first report about the existence
of sugar independent enzyme decolourising melanoidins. Ohomomo et al., (1985a) used C. versicolor Ps 4a, which 
decolourised molasses waste water 80% in darkne ss under optimum conditions. Decolourisation activity involved two 
types of intracellular enzymes, sugar dependent and sugar independent. One of these enzymes required  no sugar and 
oxygen for appearance of activity and could decolourise molasses wastewater  upto 20% darkness and 14 -17% of 
synthetic melanoidins. Thus, the participation of these H2O2 producing enzymes as part of the comple x enzymatic 
system for melanoidins degradation by fungi should be taken into account while designing any treatme nt strategy . 
Colour removal of synthetic melanoidins by Coriolus hirsutus  involves the participation of peroxidases (MnP and MIP) 
and the extracellular H2O2 produced by glucose oxidase without disregard of a partial participation of fungal laccase.

The magnesium pero xidase (MnP) has also been reported in bacteria as extracellular enzyme for decolourisation of 
melanoidin (Bhargava et al., 2009).  
One of the more complete enzymatic studies regarding melanoidin degradation was reported using palle ts of Coriolus 
hirsutus  by Miyata et al., (1998). They used the C. Hirsutus  pallets to decolourise a melanoidin containing medium. It 
was elucidated that extracellular H2O2, and two extracellular peroxidases, a manganese -independent peroxidases 
(MIP) and manganese -peroxidase (MnP)  were involved in decolourising activity. But the detail role of MnP and 
laccase in bacteria for decolourisation has not been fully investigated.  
The MnP and laccase activity in the bacterial culture supernatant decreases with the increase in the  duration and further 
bacterial incubation showed gradual decrease of both enzyme activities. The enzymes activity has dir ect correlation 
with melanoidin decolourisation. The initiation of MnP activity in culture supernatant starts at 48 hr. of bacterial 
growth and remains active for 192 hr, whereas the laccase induction starts at 96 hr. and its activity
decreased after 192 hr. This resulted in the initial role of MnP in melanoidin degradation (Yadav et  al., 2012) . The 
melanoidin decolourisation has also been reporte d by enzyme laccase in bacteria (Bhargava et al., 2009).  
The white rot basidiomycetes fungus F. flavous  produces extracellular enzymes, manganese dependent peroxidases 
(MNP), lignin peroxidases (LIP) and laccase which decolourises a number of synthetic dye s like Poly R and remazol 
brilliant blue R etc. (Raghu Kumar et al., 1999). They propose that hydrogen peroxide produced as a result of glucose 
oxidase activity acts as a bleaching agent on biomethanated spent wash which has been further confir med that in the 
absence of glucose the decolorization of MSW is lesser. With the addition of the starch to the mediu m, amylase activity 
stimulates and releasing reducing sugars, which are oxidized by glucose oxidase producing peroxide a s a by-product  
results in greate r decolourisation of biomethanated spentwash (Raghu Kumar et al., 1999).  
After considering the wholestic approach of the problem it is clear that treated spent wash doesn’t meet Central 
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) standard of discharge into streams or l and application. Moreover, groundwater 
colourisation is a standing problem for areas nearer to distilleries. So, microbial decolourisation of spent wash is the 
only solution which can be exploited to develop a technology that will not only be cost effectiv e, eco-friendly  with 
water conservation but also would meet CPCB discharge norm as well as zero discharge. Therefore, sim ultaneous 
decolourisaton and crop cultivation in immobilized artificial soil might be the complete solution of  these unsolved and 
persi stent problems (Bandyopadhyay and Paul, 2013, 2015, 2017) . 
 
VI. SIMULTANEOUS DECOLORIZATION AND CROP CULTIVATION IN IMMOBILIZED 
ARTIFICIAL SOIL BED  
 
Technologies available in the present -day market to treat biomethanated spent wash to the level of MOEF/CPCB 
discharge norms are highly energy intensive, expensive, land oriented, prone to ground water contamin ation and no 
return on investment. So, there is a need of the hour to develop a cost -effective technology to attain zero discharge with 
ROI (Bandyopadhyay a nd Paul, 2013 & 2015). The filed patent (Bandyopadhyay and Paul, 2013) has provided a 
solution to it by suggesting a physicochemical biosystem comprising consortium of bacteria immobiliz ed in artificial 
soil for the decolourisation of industrial effluents along  with its novel composition and method of preparation. This 
artificial soil would decolourise the effluent by degrading melanoidin present in it during the proc ess of operation. 
Cultivation of seasonal crops (like sunflower, cane and paddy) was carrie d out on the top of the bed by irrigating 
decolourised effluent (pastel colour - fig.-2) without additional inputs of conventional fertilizer and groundwater. The 
system would restrict ground water contamination because of recycling of decolourised effluent  (collected in pits) to 
the plant and hence zero discharge is attained.

All these claims were demonstrated in 10KLPD pilot plant (fig. -3) for simultaneous decoloursation and crop cultivati on 
in immobilized artificial soil bed (Bandyopadhyay and Paul, 2017). The pilot plant was operated cont inuously on 0.155 
acre (625m2) of land in eastern U.P. using biomethanated spent wash having input COD in the range of 20,000 -23,000 
mg/l for a period of  3-4 months. The schematic diagram of the pilot plant is presented in fig. -2.

The artificial soil formulation, h aving desirable flow properties like critical hydraulic velocity, seepage velocity, soil 
bed compaction factor, porosity and conductivity etc. is lighter than natural soil. The hydraulic re tention time and COD 
loading (200 -220 kg/day) are manipulated by su itable pipe line distribution system comprising specially designed 
network of coils to provide required seepage velocity to optimize melanoidin degradation which in tu rn would reduce 
COD and colour to the tune of 96 -98% and 98 -99% respectively. The physico -chemic o-biosystem  increases the fertility 
of the soil by arresting various
micronutrient of the effluent during the process (Bandyopadhyay and Paul, 2015). So far as the ferti lity of the artificial 
soil is concerned, it is normal with medium organic carbo n (C) and very high in available phosphorous (P) and 
potassium (K) as compared to normal soil with low carbon and minimum amount of available phosphorous  (P) and

was used for irrigating the bed for the cultivation of crops. The crop productivity increases more t han 2 folds (fig.4) .

Advantages of the process:  
 
• The pilot plant is capable to degrade COD and decolourise to the tune of 96 -98% and 98 -99% 
respectively. The final COD level would be in the range of 800 -1000 mg/l and BOD less than 25 pp m 
•       Decolou rised effluent meet CPCB norms . 
• The plant attains zero discharge (CPCB 2008).  
• No ground water contamination.  
• Higher soil fertility.  
• Good ROI because of increase in crop yield more than two -fold and also by selling soil of the bed for 
terrace and kitchen ga rden.  
• Water conservation is achieved by recycling the decolourised water for irrigation of crops.  
• Generation of rural employment.  
                                 
VII. CONCLUSION  
 
This review article is presented with the consideration of the need of distill ery industry. Different treatment strategies 
available today to treat spent wash are unable to meet the target of zero discharge. Considering ROI , biomethanation 
coupled with decolourisation and crop cultivation in artificial soil bed is the best option an d can be exploited to develop 
a cost effective eco-friendly  technology for the treatment of spent wash. Operational stability of the system can be met 
by supplementing wasted molasses as carbon source and oxygen with sparged air through low cost sparg er to make the 
system cost effective and promising.
