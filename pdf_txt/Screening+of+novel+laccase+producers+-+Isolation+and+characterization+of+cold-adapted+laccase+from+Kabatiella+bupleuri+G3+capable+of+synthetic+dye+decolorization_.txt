Abstract: Psychrophilic laccases catalyzing the bond formation in mild, environmentally friendly
conditions are one of the biocatalysts at the focus of green chemistry. Screening of 41 cold-adapted
strains of yeast and yeast-like fungi revealed a new laccase-producing strain, which was identiÔ¨Åed as
Kabatiella bupleuri G3 IBMiP according to the morphological characteristics and analysis of sequences
of the D1/D2 regions of 26S rDNA domain and the ITS1‚Äì5,8S‚ÄìITS2 region. The extracellular activity
of laccase in reaction with 2,2‚Äô-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) at the optimal
pH 3.5 was 215 U/L after 15 days of growth in a medium with waste material and 126 U/L after
25 days of cultivation in a deÔ¨Åned medium. Copper (II) ions (0.4 mM), Tween 80 (1.0 mM) and ascorbic
acid (5.0 mM) increased the production of laccase. The optimum temperature for enzyme operation
is in the range of 30‚Äì40C and retains over 60% of the maximum activity at 10C. New laccase
shows high thermolability‚Äîhalf-life at 40C was only 60 min. Enzyme degradation of synthetic dyes
was the highest for crystal violet, i.e., 48.6% after 1-h reaction with ABTS as a mediator. Outcomes
of this study present the K. bupleuri laccase as a potential psychrozyme for environmental and
industrial applications.

1. Introduction
Laccase is an enzyme belonging to the group of multicopper oxidases and catalyzing
the oxidation in which a substrate loses a single electron and is converted to a free rad-
ical. The resulting unstable radical may further undergo laccase-catalyzed oxidation or
non-enzymatic reactions such as hydration, disproportionation and polymerization. In
laccase-catalyzed reactions, diphenols undergo 4-electron oxidation. During this reaction,
the Cu(II) ion is reduced to the Cu(I) ion. Moreover, Cu(I) reduces molecular oxygen (O 2)
to produce two water molecules, and is oxidized back to Cu(II) (Figure 1) [ 1]. Laccases dis-
play a wide substrate speciÔ¨Åcity, including phenols, phenolic compounds, aminophenols,
aromatic amines, lignins and steroid hormones. For this reason, they are used in many
different industries, such as paper, petrochemical, food, and textile [ 2]. The use of laccases
adapted to low temperatures is particularly interesting. The textile, paper, printing and
tannery industries produce huge amounts of waste containing synthetic dyes toxic to the
environment. It is estimated that about 5‚Äì10% of them could remain persistent in wastew-
ater. The use of laccases allows carrying out the processes of their degradation without
using chemical and physical methods [ 3‚Äì5]. Laccase can also be used in the processes of
detoxiÔ¨Åcation of environments polluted with polycyclic aromatic compounds [6,7].

Figure 1. Scheme of a laccase catalytic cycle with 2, 2‚Äô-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic 
acid (ABTS) as a substrate, according to Riva, 2006 [8].  
Laccases are products of secondary metabolism and their synthesis is influenced by 
limiting factors, such as the type of culture, its duration and the composition of the me-
dium, or by the addition of inducers, as th e genes encoding laccases contain regulatory 
sites, e.g., metal responsive elements (MREs)  and xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs) 
[9]. The most common inducers include Cu(II) ions, aromatic compounds (veratryl alco-
hol, vanillic acid, 2,5-xylidine, ferulic acid, syringaldazine, guaiacol, p-hydroxybenzoic 
acid, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin), vitamins and essen-
tial amino acids (tryptophan, methionine, glycine, valine, biotin, riboflavin), organic sol-vents (ethanol), xenobiotics (4-n-nonylophenol,  aniline, oxidized derivatives of diquat 
and N,N‚Äô-dimethyl-N-(5-chloro-4-hydroxypheny l), urea, surfactants (Tween 80) and eth-
idium bromide [10]. 
Laccases are ubiquitous enzymes in nature. They were isolated from higher plants, 
insects and bacteria, but their main source is  white rot fungi. The first plant laccase was 
isolated from a Japanese tree, Rhus vernicifera  [11]. Fungal laccases were isolated later, in 
1896, by Bertrand [12]. Among the fungi producing this enzyme we can distinguish 
Trametes versicolor , Trametes ochracea , Trametes hirsuta , Cerrena maxima  and Coriolopsis poly-
zona , and among bacteria‚Äî Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis , Streptomyces antibioticus  and 
Azospirillum lipoferum  [9,13]. 
In this study we conducted a screening of psychrophilic and cold-adapted yeast and 
yeast-like fungi for the produc tion of laccases working at low temperatures. Decreasing 
the temperature enables lowering of the cost s of energy needed for heating the waste‚Äîon 
the contrary, the process can be conducted at the site of contamination. Despite the un-
doubted advantages of low-temperature-adapted enzymes, little information is available 
on psychrophilic laccases. Rovati et al. [14] noted the laccase activity at 15 ¬∞C from 25 yeast 
strains isolated from soil samples from de Mayo/King George Island. Certain adaptations 
to low temperatures were also observed for the laccase from Cryptococcus albidus  (renamed 
to Naganishia albida ) [15] and from Colletotrichum lagenarium  [16]. 
The characterization of the Kabatiella bupleuri  laccase conducted in this study showed 
that it is an enzyme of interest from a biotechnological point of view and that it can be 
used in in situ decolorization of synthetic dyes. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Organism Selection and Culture Conditions 
To search for producers of cold-adapted laccases, 41 strains of psychrophilic yeast 
and yeast-like fungi were used. Furthermore, 17 strains were purchased from the Italian 
collection, Industrial Yeasts Collection DBVPG (Perugia, Italy). The remaining 26 strains 
were isolated from soil samples located at 10 different sites in the vicinity of the Henryk 
Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island (62¬∞09 ‚Ä≤41‚Ä≥ S, 58¬∞28‚Ä≤10‚Ä≥ W) and

Inoculated plates with selective media were incubated at 20C for 20 d. The devel-
opment of an intense bluish-green and reddish-brown color around the wells on ABTS or
guaiacol substrate, respectively, was considered as a positive test for laccase activity.

ing media: (1) Olga medium [18], (2) modiÔ¨Åed Kirk medium (LMM) [19], (3) Sivaku-
mar medium [ 20] and (4) mineral medium in order to select the most optimal medium
for laccase production by the cold-adapted fungi. (1) The Olga medium contained (in

2. Submerged culture of Kabatiella bupleuri strain in the Sivakumar medium with the
addition of several potential inducers of laccase biosynthesis (concentrations spec-
iÔ¨Åed in the Results) such as copper (II) ions, Tween 20, Tween 80, ABTS, guaiacol,
syringaldazine, ethidium bromide, catechol, 2,5-xylidine, veratryl alcohol, vanillin
and ascorbic acid, in order to Ô¨Ånd the inducer that causes the highest enzyme activ-
ity (U/L).
3. Submerged culture in the modiÔ¨Åed Sivakumar medium with the selected inducers
(copper (II) ions and Tween 80), in which the starch was replaced by waste products
in concentrations of 20 and 100 g/L from the agri-food and brewing industry and
compounds rich in lignocellulose (carrot pomace, apple pomace, potato pulp, spent
grain from the brewery, lignin, rye straw, straw briquette).
The strains were pre-cultured in the rich medium containing 5.0 g/L yeast extract
and 10.0 g/L peptone at 20C for 3 days. This pre-culture (2.6 mL) was used to inoculate
65 mL of different laccase producing media in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer Ô¨Çask. Cultures were
conducted for 25‚Äì30 days at 20C with shaking (150 rpm). Inducers were added after
3 days of growth.
2.2. Laccase Extraction from the Biomass
Fungi biomass harvested after submerged cultures was disrupted by shaking with
glass beads. The wet biomass was disintegrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4, enriched
with 0.1% Triton-X100, 100 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl 2, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM PMSF. The
sample was vortexed for 30 s and left on ice for 30 s. The procedure was repeated 12 times.
The sample was centrifuged at 1500 gfor 5 min at 10C and the insoluble cell debris
was discarded.
2.3. Genetic IdentiÔ¨Åcation of Laccase-Producing Strain
2.3.1. DNA Extraction
Yeast and yeast-like strains were cultivated in the Ô¨Çasks with medium containing
20.0 g/L glucose, 10.0 g/L yeast extract and 20.0 g/L peptone at 20C and 150 rpm.Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 4 of 22
Biomass was centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min, 4C) and frozen at 80C. Next, 100 g of
frozen biomass was ground in the mortar with the liquid nitrogen to a uniform powder
and transferred to a 15 mL Falcon tube. One milliliter of the extraction buffer (200 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.5% SDS; 250 mM NaCl) and 2 mL of the phe-
nol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v:v:v) mixture was added; the tube was gently
shaken for 10 min at the room temperature and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 30 min. Water
phase was collected, supplemented with 5 L 10 mg/mL RNAse (EURx, Gdansk, Poland),
incubated for 1 h at 37C, and extracted (equal-volume) with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (25:24:1, v:v:v) with vigorous shaking. Water phase was collected after centrifuga-
tion (13,000 rpm, 15 min, 4C). DNA was precipitated by addition of 0.1 volume of 3 M
sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 0.6 volume of ice-cold isopropanol. The sample was incubated
over night at 20C and centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4C). DNA precipitate was
washed twice with 70% ethanol (150 L), centrifuged and dried for 2‚Äì3 min. DNA was
dissolved in 60 L of sterile RNAse-free distilled water.
2.3.2. PCR AmpliÔ¨Åcation of D1/D2 and ITS1‚Äì5,8S‚ÄìITS2 Regions
PCR ampliÔ¨Åcation of the D1/D2 regions of 26S rDNA domain and ITS1‚Äì5,8S‚ÄìITS2
region were performed using primers LR6/ITS5 and RLR3/V9 (Table 1), respectively, with
genomic DNA as a template. The reaction condition of PCR was an initial denaturation
step at 98C for 3 min; 40 cycles at 98C for 30 s denaturing, annealing at 44C for 30 s and
extension at 72C for 48 s; a Ô¨Ånal extension of 72C for 5 min followed by maintenance at
4C. PCR products were puriÔ¨Åed using a GeneMatrix Basic DNA PuriÔ¨Åcation Kit (EURx,
Gdansk, Poland) and sequenced using starters NL1FWD/NL4REV for region D1/D2 and
ITS1/ITS4 for fragment ITS1‚ÄìITS2 (Table 1).

2.3.3. Data Analysis
Sequences of region D1/D2 and fragment ITS1‚ÄìITS2 were analyzed in Nucleic Acid
Sequence Massager (http://www.cmbn.no/tonjum/seqMassager-saf.htm) (accessed on
1 June 2017) and compared to the sequences in GenBank at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nig.gov/) (accessed on 27 April 2021) using the BLASTn algorithm at NCBI. The
phylogenetic trees were calculated by the fast minimum evolution method using the results
obtained using BLAST pairwise alignments.
2.4. Raw Materials
Apple pomace, carrot pomace, potato pulp, rye straw and brewer‚Äôs spent grain (BSG)
(approx. 80% moisture content) were dried at 60C to 90% dry matter to be stored safely.
Lignin (Matocell, TZMO SA, Torun, Poland) was crushed to an average particle size of
about 1 cm. Straw briquette (Eko-Pellets, Nowy Tomysl, Poland) was in the form of light,
straw-colored cylindrical particles with diameter about 6‚Äì8 mm and length about 5‚Äì50 mm.
Materials were sterilized at 121C for 15 min before being used in culture.Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 5 of 22
Chemical characterization of BSG including estimation of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin,
crude protein content and ash content was determined according to Meneses et al. [21].
2.5. PuriÔ¨Åcation of the Laccase by Ammonium Sulphate Fractioning
Laccase G3 was extracted by the method of fractional desalting. Post-culture liquid
was centrifuged and ammonium sulphate was added in portions until the Ô¨Ånal concen-
tration of 40% to the supernatant placed on ice. After 1-h incubation and centrifugation
(8000g, 10 min), another portion was added to the supernatant until Ô¨Ånal concentration
of 60%. The process was repeated twice more to obtain 80% and 100% saturation with
ammonium sulphate. The pellet containing precipitated laccase was recovered by centrifu-
gation at 8000gfor 10 min at 4C and then dissolved in 10 mM acetate buffer pH 5.5. The
pre-puriÔ¨Åed laccase extract was dialyzed for 24 h against water and then analyzed for its
activity and protein concentration. Samples were concentrated prior to SDS-PAGE analysis
in the Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal Ô¨Ålter units with MWCO of 10 kDa (Merck Millipore,
Burlington, MA, USA).
2.6. SDS-P AGE
Molecular mass of the laccases was determined by SDS-PAGE [ 22] in 12% polyacry-
lamide gel and 0.1 M Tris-glycine buffer pH 8.3. Samples were denatured for 10 min at
96C in a sample buffer with 1% SDS and 10% -mercaptoethanol. Precision Plus Protein
Unstained Standards (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) were used as mass standards. Bands
were visualized with Bio-Safe Coomassie Stain (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Molecu-
lar mass was determined using Quantity One software (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) on
densitometer BioRad GS-800.
2.7. Effect of Temperature and pH on Laccase Activity and Stability
The optimum temperature for laccase activity was determined by incubating the
reaction mixture over a temperature range of 0‚Äì80C at pH 3.5. To investigate the ther-
mostability of the enzyme, it was incubated in the range of 5‚Äì80C for 0‚Äì120 min within a
30 min interval, followed by measuring the remaining enzyme activity at pH 3.5. The effect
of pH on laccase activity and stability was determined using 10 mM Britton‚ÄìRobinson
buffer for pH 2.0‚Äì10.0, at the optimum temperature. The enzyme was incubated for 24 h
and then the relative activity of laccase was determined. All reactions were performed
in triplicates.
2.8. Substrate SpeciÔ¨Åcity of Laccase
Substrate speciÔ¨Åcity of laccase from K.bupleuri was estimated using ABTS and syringal-
dazine ("526= 6.5104M 1cm 1; conc. 5.5‚Äì40.0 M) as a substrate. Firstly, optimum pH
for syringaldazine as obtained in 10 mM Britton‚ÄìRobinson buffer pH 2.0‚Äì10.0 and with
30M concentration. Activity determination was carried out at 30C. Kinetic parameters,
namely, K mand V max, were determined using the Lineweaver‚ÄìBurk plots.
2.9. Decolorization of Synthetic Dyes
Four synthetic dyes: methylene blue ( = 668 nm), basic fuchsine ( = 544 nm),
Coomassie Brilliant Blue ( = 555 nm) and crystal violet ( = 590 nm) were decolorized with
the puriÔ¨Åed laccase. Stock solutions of dyes were prepared in sterile distilled water. The
total volume of the reaction mixture was 2 mL, which contained acetate buffer (100 mM,
pH 3.5), synthetic dye (250 mg/L), 200 L of puriÔ¨Åed laccase (0.1 U) and 1.0 mM of
ABTS as a redox mediator. The mixture was incubated at 30C for 60 min, and then the
absorbance was measured. The percentage was determined spectrophotometrically as the
relative decrease in absorbance at each maximal absorbance wavelength of the dyes. The
decolorization of dye, expressed as dye decolorization (%) was calculated by means of
Formula (1):
decolorization (%) = [(A i Af)/A i]100, (1)Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 6 of 22
where: A i‚Äîinitial concentration of the dye and A f‚ÄîÔ¨Ånal concentration of the dye. All
reactions were performed in triplicates.
2.10. Analytical Methods
Laccase activity was determined by the oxidation of ABTS method [ 23]. Biomass
was discarded (5000 g, 15 min, 4C) and the laccase activity in the supernatant was
determined. The non-phenolic dye ABTS is oxidized by laccase to the more stable and
preferred state of the cation radical. Oxidation of ABTS was monitored by determining the
increase in A 420("420, 3.6104M/cm). The reaction mixture contained 1 mM substrate
(ABTS), 150L of 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer pH 3.5, and 50 L of culture supernatant,
and was incubated for 10 min. Absorbance was read at 420 nm in a spectrophotometer
against a suitable blank with water instead of the enzyme. One unit (U) was deÔ¨Åned as the
amount of the laccase that oxidized 1 mol of ABTS substrate per min.
Lignin peroxidase, manganese-dependent peroxidase and manganese-independent
peroxidase activity was determined according to Pointing and coworkers [24].
Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford [ 25] using BSA as a
standard [25].
2.11. Statistical Analysis
Calculations were done using Microsoft Excel version 2007. Experimental values were
reported as the means s.e. Statistical comparisons were made using a one-way ANOVA
(Tukey‚Äôs test, p< 0.05). All calculations of statistical signiÔ¨Åcance were made using the
Graph Pad Prism5 and SPSS ver.11. Graphs were plotted using SigmaPlot version 11 and
Graph Pad Prism5.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Screening of Yeast and Yeast-Like Fungi for Laccase Activity
The search for a new psychrophilic laccase began with screening of yeast and yeast-
like fungi strains on the selection media containing ABTS or guaiacol as indicators of
extracellular activity of the enzyme. The plates were incubated for 20 days at 20C. A green
ring around the colonies on the ABTS medium or a brown one on the guaiacol medium was
observed for four strains, i.e., Cryptococcus gastricus DBVPG, Cryptococcus aerius DBVPG,
Leuconeurospora sp. D59 IBMiP and strain G3 IBMiP (Figure 2). These strains were then
cultivated in Sivakumar, Olga, Kirk and mineral media for 25 days at 20C with 200 rpm
shaking. For the Ô¨Årst three of them, both the extracellular and intracellular activity of
laccase was very low and did not exceed 1 U/L. Much higher activity (~35 U/L), was
determined for the G3 strain IBMiP (Figure 3).
H2O2did not alter the oxidation of ABTS, indicating the lack of peroxidase activity.
Lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase were not detected either.
The growth dynamics of the G3 strain IBMiP indicated that the extracellular laccase is

3.2. Genetic IdentiÔ¨Åcation of Strain G3 IBMiP
In order to determine the taxonomic identiÔ¨Åcation of the G3 IBMiP strain, genomic
DNA was isolated and the fragments encoding the D1/D2 region of the large 26S rDNA
subunit and the ITS1‚Äì5,8S‚ÄìITS2 region between the genes encoding the 18S and 26S
rDNA subunits were ampliÔ¨Åed. PuriÔ¨Åed DNA fragments were sequenced and aligned
using BLASTn with the homologous sequences deposited in GenBank. The obtained
amplicon sequences were deposited into GenBank (accession numbers MW450856.1 andBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 8 of 22
MW450864.1). The coding sequence for the D1/D2 region showed more than 99% similarity
to that of the Kabatiella bupleuri strain F278240 (JN886792.1), while for the sequence of the
ITS1 and ITS2 region, the greatest similarity was observed for K. bupleuri CBS 131304
(NR_121524.1). The morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of the
strain conÔ¨Årmed its belonging to the species K. bupleuri (data not shown).
Phylogenetic trees were prepared to investigate the similarity of the strain G3 IBMiP
to other yeast (Supplementary Materials Figures S1 and S2). The results revealed a high
similarity of K. bupleuri to the genera Aureobasidium orHormonema , to which they were orig-
inally classiÔ¨Åed. However, molecular analysis of rRNA-encoding genes by Bills et al. [ 26]
allowed for identiÔ¨Åcation of the new species. Further research carried out in the USA and
Thailand conÔ¨Årmed the differences between the genera Aureobasidium and Kabatiella in
terms of different growth conditions [27].
3.3. Optimization of Growth Conditions of K. bupleuri to Increase Laccase Biosynthesis
Inducers for Laccase Synthesis
In order to facilitate the extracellular activity of K. bupleuri laccase G3 in the previously
selected Sivakumar medium, the concentration of copper (II) ions was increased 40- and
100-fold compared to the starting medium (0.01 mM Cu2+; the values were selected based
on the literature data [ 28,29]). Copper (II) ions are considered to be an efÔ¨Åcient inducer
of laccase biosynthesis as they are part of the active site by being involved in the transfer
of electrons. Most monomeric laccases contain four copper atoms at the following sites:
the type I copper (T1), type II copper (T2) and two of type III copper (T3). The T2 and T3
copper sites form a trinuclear center that is involved in the catalytic mechanism of the
enzyme [1].
The addition of copper (II) ions to the medium signiÔ¨Åcantly increased the laccase
activity in the supernatant by approx. 50% for 20 days (Figure 4). The highest activity, about
50 U/L, was recorded after 24 days of cultivation in a medium with 0.4 mM CuSO 4. Similar
activity values were observed for the higher concentration of copper ions. Therefore, taking
into account the economic advantages of the process, a lower concentration was used in
further studies for the biosynthesis of laccase. It has been demonstrated that copper (II) ions
are an effective inducer of laccase production at concentrations of 0.15 ‚Äì5.0 mM [7,28‚Äì36] .
Chen et al. described a signiÔ¨Åcant role of this enhancer in regulating the expression of
genes encoding laccases in Volvariella volvacea V14 [ 31]. By gradually increasing the con-
centration of Cu2+to 0.2 mM, an increase in the amount of RNA was observed. At the
higher concentration (0.3 mM) the effect was opposite and a 70% decrease in the amount
of transcript was observed. Guo et al. observed 30 higher activity of an extracellular
laccase at 1.0 mM Cu2+[37]. The production of the enzyme was also facilitated by these
ions at concentrations of 1.5‚Äì2.0 mM for Trametes pubescens MB89. The authors have also
demonstrated the impact of time of the addition of the ions to the medium‚Äîaddition at day
4 was the most favorable [ 38]. Both Galhaup and Haltrich [ 38] and K lonowska et al. [30]
observed that the addition of copper (II) ions to the sterile medium partially inhibited the
growth of fungal biomass and, consequently, the amount of laccase produced. A similar
effect was noted with too-late dosing of these ions to the substrate. This was also conÔ¨Årmed
in the present study, where the best effect of induction of G3 laccase production by the
K. bupleuri strain was observed when copper (II) ions were added to the medium after
3 days of growth. In the case of laccase produced by Monilinia fructicola , it was the day 2
of culture. In the presence of 1 mM Cu2+and Mg2+ions, a 5-fold increase in the activity
of this enzyme was observed in the post-culture liquid compared to the culture without
inducers [39].Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 9 of 22

A clear positive effect on the activity of laccase in K. bupleuri culture was found for
Tween 80. After 20 days of cultivation in a medium enriched with 0.4 mM Cu2+and 1 mM
Tween 80, over 50% increase in activity to the level of about 70 U/L was observed. This non-
ionic surfactant is added to the medium, e.g., to increase the secretion of proteins [ 40,41].
Similar results were obtained for other fungal laccases from Marasmius quercophilus [30],
Pholiota sp.,Peniphora sp. and Peniophora sp. [ 42]. The impact of Tween 80 was also inves-
tigated by Pointing et al., however, it was less signiÔ¨Åcant than 2,5-xylidine as an inducer
for the production of laccase by Pycnoporus sanguineus CY788 [ 24]. In turn, for the optimal
synthesis of laccase by P . sanguineus G05, a medium containing Tween 80 and 2,5-xylidine
simultaneously was tested, resulting in an over 6-fold increase in the enzyme activity [ 43].
A signiÔ¨Åcant positive effect on the activity of K. bupleuri laccase was also observed
for ethidium bromide, veratryl alcohol, syringaldazine and catechol. These compounds
increased their activity by approx. 10‚Äì20% compared to the control sample containing only
0.4 mM Cu2+. Numerous authors have reported an increase in laccase activity as a result of
the addition of veratryl alcohol to the culture of Botryosphaeria sp. [44,45],Phlebia brevispora ,
Phlebia radiata ,Daedalea Ô¨Çavida ,Polyporus sanguineus [46],T. versicolor [34] and bacterium
Chromohalobacter salexigens [47], syringaldazine‚Äîto the culture of Coriolus hirsutus [48],
ethidium bromide‚Äîto the culture of Cyathus bulleri [49], and Ô¨Ånally catechol‚Äîto the
culture of T. versicolor [50]. Catechol was added to the culture at 72 h of cultivation and
after another 24 h, which yielded a 10-fold increase in activity to the level of approx.
1U/mL . Lower (only 10% higher laccase activity, than in the control) enhancing ability for
catechol was observed by Galhaup and Haltrich [ 38]. Inducers often reported as effective
for laccases, such as 2,5-xylidine [ 31,38,47,51,52], guaiacol [ 33,38,46‚Äì48], ABTS [ 34] and
vanillin [ 53] were found ineffective for the G3 laccase and in the research of Guo et al. [ 37].
Other fungal laccase inducers, however not tested in this study, were reported in the
literature: D-phenylalanine [ 54], phenylhydrazine, 4-methylcatechol [ 33], organic solvents
like ethanol [ 55‚Äì57] or acetone [ 58], 4-n-nonylphenol [ 59], actinomycin D [ 60], ferulic
acid [57] and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid [61].
3.4. Effect of Ascorbic Acid on Laccase Production
K. bupleuri yeast-like fungi grown in Sivakumar medium produces carotenoid pig-
ments, which causes the biomass to become orange to dark red in color. The production of
extracellular K. bupleuri laccase is closely related to the appearance of the amber and, with
time, dark brown color of the culture liquid. On completion of the culture, the pigment
is observed in the biomass and supernatant. It has been observed that the intensity of its
color is correlated with the activity of laccase; the more distinct the color of the post-culture
liquid, the higher the activity of the enzyme in the supernatant. This may be due to the
fact that laccase-inducing compounds (see Figure 5) increase the biosynthesis level of other
oxidoreductases, including, for example, peroxidases, which catalyze the polymerization
reactions of carotenoid dye molecules, leading to the formation of aggregates with in-
creased color saturation. Thurston pointed out that in a number of fungi, laccase activity is
associated with pigment formation and it is certainly possible that this is its natural role in
Aureobasidium pullulans which is closely related to K. bupleuri [62]. The highest activity of
laccase was observed for strains producing dark purple or vinaceous pigment. Colorless
strains, despite growing on media containing lignin as the only carbon source, showed no
laccase activity [52].
The presence of pigment in the supernatant makes further steps of purifying K. bupleur i
G3 laccase much more difÔ¨Åcult. Therefore, attempts were made to inhibit the dye polymer-
ization process by adding ascorbic acid to the culture medium‚Äîan antioxidant compound
that increases the stability of carotenoids [ 63]. As a result of optimization of the concentra-
tion of this additive in terms of laccase biosynthesis, it was shown that its supplementation
at a concentration of 3.0 mM and 5.0 mM caused a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in the activity of
laccase, respectively, by 50 and 100% after 25 d compared to the control sample (Figure 6),
while reducing the intensity of the color of the supernatant. It is presumed that the reducedBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 11 of 22
polymerization of the dye molecules due to the presence of the strong antioxidant made
it possible to increase the pool of a free enzyme with the active site readily available for
the substrate. Moreover, the addition of ascorbic acid, signiÔ¨Åcantly reducing the color
of the supernatant, improved the quality of its Ô¨Åltration and facilitated further stages of
enzyme puriÔ¨Åcation.

strong antioxidant made it possible to increase the pool of a free enzyme with the active 
site readily available for the substrate. Moreover, the addition of ascorbic acid, signifi-
cantly reducing the color of the supernatant, improved the quality of its filtration and 
facilitated further stages of enzyme purification.

3.5. Waste Materials in Laccase Synthesis 
Taking into account the global pursuit of  rational waste management and analyzing 
the economic considerations of the laccase biosynthesis process, the K. bupleuri  G3 strain 
was cultured in the Sivakumar medium with st arch replaced by waste products from the 
agri-food and brewing industries, such as BS G, carrot pomace, apple pomace, potato pom-
ace, lignins, rye straw and straw briquettes (F igure 7). Their selection was dictated by the 
high content of lignins, which may be inducers of G3 laccase biosynthesis (Figure 7b). 
Originally, to select the best waste carbon source, two concentrations were used: 20 and 
100 g/L. The waste material was the only carb on source in the medium. The first concen-
tration, regardless of the type of waste, turn ed out to be too low for efficient growth of K. 
bupleuri  and extracellular laccase biosynthesis (d ata not shown). For the latter, the highest 
enzyme activities were obtained using spent grains from the brewery, BSG (Figure 7a), 
and the activity levels were similar to those achieved with the starch medium. 
An important advantage of laccase biosynthesis using BSG as the only carbon source 
in the medium was a significant reduction in the cultivation time to reach the maximum 
enzyme activity (130 U/L)‚Äîfrom 20 to 25, depe nding on the type of substrate, to 14 days. 
In the following days, there was a sharp decrease in the activity of laccase in the superna-
tant, despite the constant increase in the pr otein concentration (reaching 1.16 g/L after 22 
days) (Figure 7c). The obtained protein concentrations in the media containing waste products as a carbon source are clearly high er than those determined after culturing in 
defined media (maximum 30‚Äì50 mg/L). This is due to the fact that most of the used plant 
waste materials are themselves rich in proteins . In further studies, incubation of the unin-
oculated medium was carried out in parallel to the proper culture to eliminate the protein 
content from the waste in determination of concentration.

3.5. Waste Materials in Laccase Synthesis
Taking into account the global pursuit of rational waste management and analyzing the
economic considerations of the laccase biosynthesis process, the K. bupleuri G3 strain was
cultured in the Sivakumar medium with starch replaced by waste products from the agri-
food and brewing industries, such as BSG, carrot pomace, apple pomace, potato pomace,
lignins, rye straw and straw briquettes ( Figure 7 ). Their selection was dictated by the high
content of lignins, which may be inducers of G3 laccase biosynthesis (Figure 7b). Originally,
to select the best waste carbon source, two concentrations were used: 20 and 100 g/L.
The waste material was the only carbon source in the medium. The Ô¨Årst concentration,
regardless of the type of waste, turned out to be too low for efÔ¨Åcient growth of K. bupleuri
and extracellular laccase biosynthesis (data not shown). For the latter, the highest enzyme
activities were obtained using spent grains from the brewery, BSG ( Figure 7a ), and the
activity levels were similar to those achieved with the starch medium.
An important advantage of laccase biosynthesis using BSG as the only carbon source
in the medium was a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in the cultivation time to reach the maximum
enzyme activity (130 U/L)‚Äîfrom 20 to 25, depending on the type of substrate, to 14 days. In
the following days, there was a sharp decrease in the activity of laccase in the supernatant,
despite the constant increase in the protein concentration (reaching 1.16 g/L after 22 days)
(Figure 7c). The obtained protein concentrations in the media containing waste products as
a carbon source are clearly higher than those determined after culturing in deÔ¨Åned media
(maximum 30‚Äì50 mg/L). This is due to the fact that most of the used plant waste materials
are themselves rich in proteins. In further studies, incubation of the uninoculated medium
was carried out in parallel to the proper culture to eliminate the protein content from the
waste in determination of concentration.Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 12 of 22

To simplify and minimize su bstrate costs for efficient K. bupleuri  laccase biosynthesis, 
all components of the modifi ed Sivakumar medium (except for spent grains) were re-
placed with water. This procedure was dictated  by the chemical composition of this waste 
material (Figure 7b). It is rich in hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and proteins‚Äîsubstances that are a good source of carbon, nitrogen and laccase biosynthesis inducers. The culture 
was grown in the BSG medium (100 g/L BSG in water with 0.4 mM Cu
2+ and 1 mM Tween 
80) for 20 days at 20 ¬∞C.

It was about 65% higher compared to the enzy matic activity obtained for Sivakumar with

110 U/L was observed even after 10 days (Figure 8).

It can therefore be concluded that the best  waste material for the production of lac-
case by K. bupleuri  G3 turned out to be the BSG. This raw material was also used to obtain 
T. versicolor  ATCC 20869 laccase. The solid-state ferm entation (SSF) process used BSG with 
a moisture content of 80‚Äì90% in the amount of 40‚Äì500 g. Laccase with an activity of 13,500 
U/g of dry mass was obtained during 12 days of cultivation at 30 ¬∞C [34]. Apple pomace, 
which turned out to be completely ineffective in the case of K. bupleuri  G3 culture, was 
used to obtain ligninolytic enzyme by Phanerochaete chrysosporium  BKM-F-1767 [64], and 
other enzymes including xylanase Aspergillus niger  NRRL 567 [65,66], pectinase Bacillus 
pumilus  [67], cellulases A. niger  [68] and A. niger  NRRL 567 [65], and Macrophomina 
phaseolina  [69]. Among other waste raw materials not tested in this study but used in the 
production of laccase, tomato pomace was utilized for cultivation of Coriolus versicolor  
[70].

ing 60% saturation of the solution. This fraction showed the highest specific activity of 
laccase (0.5 U/mg), the highest degree of puri fication (1.67) and the highest process effi-
ciency (58%). In the remaining fractions, the specific activity of the target enzyme was 
much lower (Table 2).

It can therefore be concluded that the best waste material for the production of laccase
byK. bupleuri G3 turned out to be the BSG. This raw material was also used to obtain
T. versicolor ATCC 20869 laccase. The solid-state fermentation (SSF) process used BSG
with a moisture content of 80‚Äì90% in the amount of 40‚Äì500 g. Laccase with an activity
of 13,500 U/g of dry mass was obtained during 12 days of cultivation at 30C [34].
Apple pomace, which turned out to be completely ineffective in the case of K. bupleuri
G3 culture, was used to obtain ligninolytic enzyme by Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-
F-1767 [ 64], and other enzymes including xylanase Aspergillus niger NRRL 567 [ 65,66],
pectinase Bacillus pumilus [67], cellulases A. niger [68] and A. niger NRRL 567 [ 65], and
Macrophomina phaseolina [69]. Among other waste raw materials not tested in this study but
used in the production of laccase, tomato pomace was utilized for cultivation of Coriolus
versicolor [70].

To initially purify the laccase from the supernatant, salting out with ammonium

Salting out with ammonium sulphate at 40% saturation of the supernatant allowed
for the precipitation of about 21% of proteins with a total activity of 0.32 U. The proteins
remaining in the supernatant were further precipitated with ammonium sulphate, reaching
60% saturation of the solution. This fraction showed the highest speciÔ¨Åc activity of laccase
(0.5 U/mg), the highest degree of puriÔ¨Åcation (1.67) and the highest process efÔ¨Åciency
(58%). In the remaining fractions, the speciÔ¨Åc activity of the target enzyme was much lower
(Table 2).Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 14 of 22
3.6.2. SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE was performed for all concentrated protein fractions after salting out. The
electropherogram (Figure 9) shows the protein band present in the post-culture supernatant
and in one of the fractions for which the highest level of activity was achieved (60%
saturation, lane 3 at Figure 9; the band is indicated by the red box). Such preliminary
puriÔ¨Åcation of the preparation allowed determining of the molecular weight of the tested
protein. The laccase produced by K. bupleuri may have a mass of about 70‚Äì75 kDa (lane 3,
Figure 9 ). For the remaining fractions, the potential laccase band of the desired molecular
weight is very poorly visible, which results from a much smaller overall pool of proteins.
Moreover, during the selection of the best waste material for laccase production, the
analysis of SDS-PAGE electropherograms showed that the activity of laccase correlates
with the presence of the protein band of about 70‚Äì75 kDa. In the supernatants where no
laccase activity was observed, the band of this size was not identiÔ¨Åed (results not shown).
The size of the G3 laccase is typical for fungal laccase. For example, A. pullulans NRRL
50381 produces a laccase of 60‚Äì70 kDa, while the enzyme from A. pullulans NRRL Y-2568
has a mass greater than 100 kDa [ 52]. Laccases produced by fungi from the genus Trametes
also have a mass of 60‚Äì70 kDa; enzymes from Populus euramericana and Myceliophthora
thermophila are slightly heavier‚Äî90 and 80 kDa, respectively [1].

3.6.3. Properties of th e Preliminary Purified K. bupleuri  Laccase G3 
The optimal conditions for the operation of the pre-purified extracellular laccase pro-

tion with ABTS was observed at  temperatures in the range of 30‚Äì40 ¬∞C. It was noted that

3.6.3. Properties of the Preliminary PuriÔ¨Åed K. bupleuri Laccase G3
The optimal conditions for the operation of the pre-puriÔ¨Åed extracellular laccase
produced by the yeast K. bupleuri G3 were determined. Maximum activity in the 10 min
reaction with ABTS was observed at temperatures in the range of 30‚Äì40C. It was noted
that T optis not an absolute value as it decreases with increasing reaction time (Figure 10).
A temperature of 30C was assumed to be the optimal temperature of action of G3 laccase.
The study of the thermostability of this enzyme was carried out in the temperature range

the enzyme activity after 120 min. For a shorter time, i.e., 30 and 60 min, laccase remains
stable at temperatures up to 35C, but above this value a very marked decrease in activity
has already been observed. It was found that 30 min incubation of the enzyme at 40C
causes a loss of 37% of the activity, while after 120 min only approx. 20% of the maximum
activity remains. Moreover, the temperature of 50C causes a complete laccase inactivation
during 30-min incubation.

Ô¨Årst enzyme of its kind for which activity was also observed at 0 and 4C. Most of the
known multicopper oxidases are thermophilic enzymes characterized by high optimal
operating temperatures, and the fungal laccases from the literature usually have T optof
50‚Äì60C [29,35,45,71‚Äì74]. Homologues with lower T optwere also described, e.g., laccases
from A. pullulans [51,52],Monilinia fructicola [39],Aureobasidium melanogenum [75],V . volvacea
V14 [ 31] and Cerrena sp. HYB07 [ 72] operate at high activity at 30‚Äì45C, similarly to the
K. bupleuri laccase reported in this study. Lower optimal temperature was reported for
Ganoderma lucidum laccases (20‚Äì25C) [76], which additionally retains 65% of maximum
activity in the reaction conducted at 10C. At the same time, however, it is characterized
by greater thermostability than G3 laccase, maintaining approx. 90% activity after 4-h
incubation at 40C. An interesting example of a laccase with a wide range of operating
temperatures is the enzyme produced by Pycnoporus sp. SYBC-L1. It shows the highest
activity at 70C, while at the same time during the reaction carried out at 0C and 10C it
retains approx. 30% and 40% of the maximum activity, respectively. Interestingly, it also
catalyzes the ABTS oxidation reaction at 100C, maintaining about 40% of the maximum
activity [ 32]. Another example of a laccase with a low optimum temperature of action is the
enzyme from Cryptococcus albidus (now Naganishia albida ) described by Singhal et al. [ 15]. It
is the most active at pH 2.5 and 20‚Äì30C. It has a relatively low thermal stability, with a
half-life of 81 min at 25C, 77 min at 35C and 64 min at 45C [15]. Another extremely
thermolabile enzyme is the laccase from C. lagenarium . Its optimal reaction temperature
with ABTS is 40C, but after 1 h at 30C it loses 28% of its activity, and temperatures of
50‚Äì60C completely inactivate it within 10 min [ 16]. Finally, a homologous fungal enzyme,
produced by Trichoderma atroviride , retains 100% and 80% of the maximum activity after
24-h incubation at 4C and 30C, respectively. Only above 50C, does 2-h incubation lead
to a clear inactivation of the enzyme, which then retains approx. 20% of the maximum
activity [ 28]. However, most of the reported laccases remain stable for at least 1 h at
50C [52,71,73,74,77,78].
The inÔ¨Çuence of pH on the activity of G3 laccase produced by K. bupleuri was deter-
mined. Maximum activity was observed at pH 3.5 for ABTS and at pH 7.0 for syringal-
dazine at 30C (Figure 11). This enzyme has a relatively high stability over a wide pH
range. During 24-h incubation of the enzyme in solutions in the range of pH 3.5‚Äì8.5, it
retains over 80% of its maximum activity, and in the narrower range of pH 4.5‚Äì6.0 as much
as 95% of activity. In an environment with a pH below pH 3.5 and above pH 8.5, a sharp
decrease in activity and inactivation of the enzyme was observed.

The influence of pH on the activity of G3 laccase produced by K. bupleuri  was deter-

as 95% of activity. In an environment with a pH below pH 3.5 and above pH 8.5, a sharp 
decrease in activity and inactivation of the enzyme was observed.

The optimum pH in reaction with ABTS observed for fungal laccases is most often
in the range of 3.0‚Äì4.0 [ 16,28,31,35,45,72,75]. A slightly higher value, pH 5.0, was notedBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 17 of 22
forA. pullulans laccases [ 51] and for Thielavia sp. [ 74]; and pH 4.5‚Äì5.0 for the laccases
from M. fructicola [39]. A much more acidic operating environment is preferred by laccase
produced by Coprinopsis cinerea Okayama 7, with its highest activity towards ABTS is
recorded at pH 2.5 [ 71]. Values of optimal pH for syringaldazine oxidation are usually
higher than observed for ABTS and are in the range of 5.5‚Äì7.0 [ 31,71,77,78]. The pH-
stability of laccases also varies and depends on the manufacturer. Thus, laccases from
M. fructicola [39],C. lagenarium [16],T. hirsuta [29] and Thielavia sp. [ 74] are stable in an
acidic pH range of 3.0‚Äì5.0, whereas the laccase from Trametes sp. operates at alkaline
pH7.0‚Äì9.0 [35]. Broad pH-stability range was observed for several homologous laccases
from Chaetomium sp. (pH 4.0‚Äì9.0) [ 73],Elaeocarpus sylvestris (pH 4.0‚Äì10.0) [ 32] and Shiraia
sp. SUPER-H168 (pH 4.0‚Äì9.0) [78].
The apparent K mand V maxvalues for ABTS were 0.584 mM and 1.14 U/mg at pH 3.5 ,
respectively. Moreover, the enzyme from K. bupleuri G3 demonstrated a strong afÔ¨Ånity
to syringaldazine (K m= 0.028 mM, V max= 0.597 U/mg), which conÔ¨Årmed that the new
enzyme is a laccase. Obtained K mvalue for ABTS was lower than for the psychrophilic
laccase from C. albidus (Km= 0.8158 mM) [ 15] and higher than for C. lagenarium laccase
(Km= 0.34 mM ) [16]. However, K mvalue for syringaldazine was similar to values obtained
for the laccase from V . volvacea V14 (K m= 0.01 mM, V max= 4.9 U/mg) [ 31] and the laccase
from C. cinerea (Km= 0.0226 mM) [71].

The optimum pH in reaction with ABTS observed for fungal laccases is most often in 
the range of 3.0‚Äì4.0 [16,28,31,35,45,72,75]. A slightly higher value, pH 5.0, was noted for 
A. pullulans  laccases [51] and for Thielavia  sp. [74]; and pH 4.5‚Äì5.0 for the laccases from M. 
fructicola  [39]. A much more acidic operating environment is preferred by laccase pro-
duced by Coprinopsis cinerea  Okayama 7, with its highest activity towards ABTS is rec-
orded at pH 2.5 [71]. Values of optimal pH for syringaldazine oxidation are usually higher 
than observed for ABTS and are in the range of 5.5‚Äì7.0 [31,71,77,78]. The pH-stability of 
laccases also varies and depends on the manufacturer. Thus, laccases from M. fructicola  
[39], C. lagenarium  [16], T. hirsuta  [29] and Thielavia  sp. [74] are stable in an acidic pH range 
of 3.0‚Äì5.0, whereas the laccase from Trametes  sp. operates at alkaline pH 7.0‚Äì9.0 [35]. Broad 
pH-stability range was observed for several homologous laccases from Chaetomium  sp. 
(pH 4.0‚Äì9.0) [73], Elaeocarpus sylvestris  (pH 4.0‚Äì10.0) [32] and Shiraia  sp. SUPER-H168 (pH 
4.0‚Äì9.0) [78]. 
The apparent K m and V max values for ABTS were 0.584 mM and 1.14 U/mg at pH 3.5, 
respectively. Moreover, the enzyme from K. bupleuri  G3 demonstrated a strong affinity to 
syringaldazine (K m = 0.028 mM, V max = 0.597 U/mg), which confirmed that the new enzyme 
is a laccase. Obtained K m value for ABTS was lower than for the psychrophilic laccase 
from C. albidus (Km = 0.8158 mM) [15] and higher than for C. lagenarium laccase (K m = 0.34 
mM) [16]. However, K m value for syringaldazine was similar to values obtained for the 
laccase from V. volvacea V14 (K m = 0.01 mM, V max = 4.9 U/mg) [31] and the laccase from 
C. cinerea  (K m = 0.0226 mM) [71].

The most popular synthetic dyes in the industry can be divided into azo, hetero-
cyclic/polymeric or triphenylmethanes due to their chemical structure. K. bupleuri laccase
can be successfully used in the process of removing dyes such as alkaline fuchsin and
crystal violet. Both dyes are used in microbiology in many methods of staining prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells. In addition, alkaline fuchsin is used in molecular biology to stain gly-
coproteins and nucleic acids, e.g., with Schiff‚Äôs reagent. Crystal violet is used to dye fabrics.
After 1 h of incubation of K. bupleuri laccase with the tested dyes at 30C, decolorization of
approx. 32% and approx. 40% was observed for fuchsin and crystal violet, respectively.
Crystal violet, also known as hexamethyl pararosaniline chloride, is a triphenylmethane
dye, while alkaline fuchsin is not a speciÔ¨Åc dye but a mixture of triarylmethane dyes such as
pararosaniline, rosaniline and new fuchsin. The differences in the degree of decolorization
of these dyes prove that K. bupleuri laccase efÔ¨Åciently oxidizes only selected components
of alkaline fuchsin with the structure of pararosaniline derivatives in the presence of a
mediator. Moturi and Singara Charya studied the process of crystal violet decolorization by
whole fungal cells of Mucor mucedo ,Polyporus elegans ,T. versicolor and Lenzites betulina [79].
The decolorization process observed during fungal growth ranged from 63 to 78% after
5 and 15 days of cultivation, respectively. The authors showed that several extracellular
enzymes are responsible for this process, including laccases, manganese-dependent peroxi-
dases and lignin peroxidases. Other studies indicated the possibility of using a puriÔ¨Åed
laccase to effectively decolorize crystal violet. The laccase from Pandoraea sp. ISTKB had
the ability to remove this dye in 82% during 1-h reaction with ABTS as a mediator, but
using twice the concentration of the enzyme and a higher temperature than in the present
study [ 80]. On the other hand, Tplac laccase from T. pubescens catalyzes the degradation of
dyes without the addition of a mediator. The degree of decolorization of methylene blue
was 25% and 17% by immobilized and free laccase, respectively, while for crystal violet
it was 21% and 14%, respectively. The process was carried out at pH 5.0 at 50C with
the use of an enzyme with an activity of 1 U/mL [ 81]. Bacterial laccase derived from the
strain Kurthia huakuii LAM0618 also has the ability to degrade the dyes described in this
study. In the reaction carried out at 60C for 1 h in the presence of 0.1 mM ABTS, approx.
35% degradation of alkaline fuchsin and approx. 60% degradation of crystal violet were
observed. Without the addition of a mediator, the degree of discoloration was lower and
amounted to approx. 25% and approx. 15%, respectively. The process of decolorization of
methylene blue in the presence of ABTS was about 80% effective, and without the mediator,
the dye remained intact [82].
Coomassie Brilliant Blue also belongs to the group of triphenylmethane dyes and is
used in molecular biology to stain proteins. Forootanfar et al. investigated the effectiveness
of three laccases from Aspergillus oryzae ,T. versicolor and Paraconiothyrium variabile to
decolorize this dye in a shaken culture at 35C [83]. Laccases with an activity of approx.
8 U/mL and hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) as a mediator were used. The highest degree
of decolorization was observed for P . variabile laccase; after 1-h reaction it was about 55%,
and after 3 h as much as 90%. The A. oryzae and T. versicolor laccases showed lower efÔ¨Åcacy,
approx. 5% and 25%, respectively, after 1 h, and 13% and 30% after 3 h of incubation. In
this study, laccase from K. bupleuri only achieved about 20% of the decolorization degree of
Coomassie Brilliant Blue after 1 h of reaction, which corresponds to the commercial activity
ofT. versicolor laccase.
The last dye tested was methylene blue belonging to the group of heterocyclic dyes. It
is a thiazine derivative used in medicine, chemistry and microbiology. The efÔ¨Åciency of
decolorization of this dye by K. bupleuri laccase was similar to that of Coomassie Brilliant
Blue and amounted to approx. 18%. Similar values were found for P . variabile laccase
and it was about 15% discolored after 1 h of the reaction and 21% after 3 h. Commercial
laccases from A. oryzae and T. versicolor show a much greater activity towards the removal
of methylene blue, approximately 90% and 50% decolorization, respectively [ 83]. The
degree of dye decolorization, similar to the studied K. bupleuri laccase, amounting to
approx. 12%, was also found for laccase from Pandoraea sp. ISTKB, but the enzyme‚ÄôsBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 828 19 of 22
concentration was twice as high and the reaction was conducted at a higher temperature of
37C [80]. Lac2 laccase from Cerrena sp. HYB07 in the presence of acetosyringone (ACE)
as a mediator showed a high decolorization efÔ¨Åciency of alkaline fuchsin, crystal violet
and Coomassie Brilliant Blue, 81%, 87% and 100%, respectively, but using a 20-fold higher
enzyme concentration. The degree of decolorization of methylene blue was clearly lower
than that observed for the K. bupleuri laccase, only about 6% [ 72]. Similar results were
obtained by Ademakinwa and Agboola [ 84] for A. pullulans laccases‚Äî4.5% decolorization
of the dye in a 3-h reaction, whereas the laccase from Shiraia sp. SUPER-H168 described by
Yang et al. [78] did not display any activity towards decolorization of methylene blue.
4. Conclusions
The conducted research reported a new laccase-producing strain‚Äî K. bupleuri G3
IBMiP . Enzyme production is induced by copper (II) ions and Tween 80 added to the
medium after three days of the growth. Moreover, the positive effect of ascorbic acid
on improving the quality of Ô¨Åltration and facilitating the puriÔ¨Åcation of the enzyme by
reducing the polymerization and degradation of carotenoid dyes produced by K. bupleuri ,
and so increasing the activity of laccase in the post-culture liquid, was demonstrated. The
high activity of laccase G3 (215.4 U/L after 15 days) was obtained on a cheap substrate
containing the BSG waste material. The new enzyme is characterized by cold adaptation
manifested by high activity at low temperatures and low thermostability, which makes it an
interesting biocatalyst in reactions carried out in cold environments. High thermolability
allows for an easy inactivation of the enzyme. The potential of the enzyme in the processes
of decolorization of synthetic dyes from the triphenylmethane dyes group and methylene
blue belonging to heterocyclic/thiazine dyes was also reported. Further planned work
on the new laccase from K. bupleuri G3 IBMiP includes the isolation and expression of the
laccase-encoding gene in a heterologous host to shorten the cultivation time and increase
the enzymatic activity.
It is worth emphasizing that so far, no enzymes produced by K. bupleuri yeast have
been described in the literature. For the Ô¨Årst time, this research shows the ability of
these microorganisms to produce enzymes, including the cold-adapted laccase, which is
extremely interesting from a biotechnological point of view.
