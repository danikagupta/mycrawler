and its ability to remove textile dyes (maxilon blue GRL, and direct yellow DY 12), from aqueoussolutions were reported in this study. The adsorbent was characterized with Fourier transform infra-
red spectrophotometer (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Various physiochemical
parameters such as, contact time, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, particle size, pH ofdye solution and temperature were investigated in a batch-adsorption technique. Result showed that
the adsorption of both GRL and DY 12 dyes was favorable at acidic pH. The adsorption uptake was
found to increase with increase in initial dye concentration, and contact time but decreases with theamount of adsorbent, particle size, and temperature of the system. The chemisorption, intra-particle
diffuse, pseudo-ﬁrst-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were applied to test the experi-
mental data. The pseudo-second order exhibited the best ﬁt for the kinetic studies, which indicates thatadsorption of (GRL, and DY 12) is limited by chemisorption process. The equilibrium data were eval-uated using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Fritz–Schlunder isotherms. The Fritz–Schlunder
model best describes the uptake of (GRL and DY 12) dye, which implies that the adsorption of textiles
dyes in this study onto coconut husk activated carbon is heterogeneous with multi-layers. Thermody-namic parameters such as Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy were determined. It was found that
(GRL and DY 12) dye adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic.

1. Introduction
Water pollution is one of the most undesirable environmental
problems in the world and it requires solutions. Textile indus-
tries produce a lot of wastewater, which contains a number of
contaminants, including acidic or caustic dissolved solids, toxiccompounds, and any different dyes, many of these dyes are
carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic and also toxic to
human beings, ﬁsh species, and microorganisms. Hence, their*Corresponding author. Tel./fax: +964 7801324986.

provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector removal from aquatic wastewater becomes environmentally
important ( Konicki et al., 2013 ).
Large quantities of dangerous dyes, pigments and metals
originated from dye manufacturing, textile as well as pulp
and paper industries are emitted into wastewaters. This makestreating water contamination difﬁcult , because the color tends
to persist even after the conventional removal processes ( Visa
et al., 2010 ). The dye contaminations in water tend to prevent
light penetration and therefore, affect photosynthesis consider-
ably ( Banerjee and Chattopadhyaya, 2013; Hajati et al., 2014;
Hameed et al., 2013 ). Due to the wide application of dye com-
pound and their numerous hazard and toxic derivatives, thecleaning of wastewater from color dyestuff becomes environ-
mentally important ( Ghaedi et al., 2013 ). Although, synthetic
origins aromatic dyes are even biologically non-degradableand their treatment by other effective conventional procedure
is impossible.
There are several methods available for color removal from
waters and wastewaters such as membrane separation, aerobic
and anaerobic degradation using various microorganisms,
chemical oxidation, coagulation and ﬂocculation, and reverseosmosis. Some of these techniques have been shown to be
effective however they have some limitations such as excess
amount of chemical usage, accumulation of concentratedsludge that has serious disposal problems and lack of effectivecolor reduction. The adsorption technique, which is based on
the transfer of pollutants from the solution to the solid phase,
is known as one of the efﬁcient and general wastewater treat-ment method ( Ghaedi et al., 2012 ). The method is superior
to other dye removal techniques in terms of initial cost, sim-
plicity of design, ease of operation, and non-toxicity of the uti-lized adsorbents compared to other conventional wastewater
treatment methods ( Kismir and Aroguz, 2011 ). The cost effec-
tiveness, availability and adsorptive properties are the maincriteria in selection of an adsorbent to remove organic com-
pounds from wastewaters ( Demirbas et al., 2008; Ghaedi
et al., 2012 ), also application of adsorption procedure espe-
cially based on non-toxic and green adsorbent with high sur-face area and reactive surface atom is a great demand
(Chiou and Chuang, 2006 ).
Activated carbon, a widely used adsorbent in industrial
processes, is composed of a microporous, homogenous struc-
ture with high surface area and shows radiation stability ( Iqbal
and Ashiq, 2007 ). The process for producing high-efﬁciency
activated carbon is not completely investigated in developing
countries. Furthermore, there are many problems with the
regeneration of used activated carbon. Nowadays, there is agreat interest in ﬁnding inexpensive and effective alternativesto the existing commercial activated carbon ( AlOthman
et al., 2013 ). Exploring effective and low-cost activated carbon
may contribute to environmental sustainability and offer ben-eﬁts for future commercial applications. The costs of activated
carbon prepared from biomaterials are very low compared to
the cost of commercial activated carbon. Waste materials thathave been successfully used to manufacture activated carbon in
the recent past include waste wood ( Acharya et al., 2009 ), ba-
gasse ( Tsai et al., 2001 ), coir pith ( Namasivayam and Kavitha,
2002), orange peel ( Khaled et al., 2009 ), coffee husk ( Ahmad
and Rahman, 2011 ), pine cone ( Gecgel and Kolancilar,
2012), coconut tree ( Senthilkumaar et al., 2006 ), sunﬂower
seed hull ( Thinakaran et al., 2008 ), pine-fruit shell ( Royeret al., 2009 ), hazelnut husks, rice hulls, oil palm shell ( Tan
et al., 2008 ), and Coconut husk ( Foo and Hameed, 2012 ).
The objective of this work is to study the static capacity of
adsorption of textile dyes (GRL, and DY 12) by the prepared
activated carbons derived by coconut shells (CSAC). The ef-fects of contact time, initial dye concentration, mass dosage,
temperature, and pH on the static adsorption of the dye onto
the prepared CSAC were examined. The pseudo-ﬁrst order andpseudo-second order models are used to correlate the adsorp-
tion kinetics data of GRL and DY 12 onto prepared activated
carbons. The kinetics as well as the diffusion parameters arealso evaluated. Thermodynamic studies have also been per-formed to understand the processes of removal of the selected
dyes on CSAC.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and methods
Maxilon blue GRL [ kmax= 599 nm] and direct yellow DY 12
[kmax= 403 nm] were obtained from Al-Hilla /C223Textile Com-
pany (Babylon, Iraq). The chemical structures of maxilon blue
GRL and direct yellow DY 12 are shown in Fig. 1 . Concentra-
tions of dyes were determined by ﬁnding out the absorbance atthe characteristic wavelength using a double beam UV/Vis
spectrophotometer (UV–Visible spectrophotometer, Shimadzu
1650). Calibration curves were plotted between absorbanceand concentration of the dye solution.
2.2. Preparation of H 2SO4-activated carbon (CSAC)
Coconut shells are obtained from the Iraqis local markets and
were used as precursors. Firstly, they were washed with dis-
tilled water to remove any adhering impurities, and then dried
at 110 /C176C for 24 h followed by grinding and sieving in order to
use particles size ranged between 1 mm and 2 mm. H 2SO4/acti-
vated carbon sample (CSAC) was prepared via two steps: car-
bonization of dried precursor at 500 /C176C for 2 h in the absence
of air using a mufﬂe furnance (600 ·40 mm) at a rate of 10 /C176C/
min up to 500 /C176C. The carbonized sample was cooled and
soaked with certain weight of H 2SO4(20 g of carbonized sam-
ple with 60 g of H 2SO4(50%)) in 100 ml distilled water for
24 h at room temperature, followed by drying at 110 /C176C and
ﬁnally activated at 600 /C176C for 4 h. Prepared sample was
washed several times with distilled water till neutral ﬁltrateand then dried at 110 /C176C to constant weight and ﬁnally stored
in a clean dry glass bottle.
2.3. Characterization of prepared H 2SO4-activated carbon
(CSAC)
Infrared spectra of the adsorbents were obtained using a Fou-
rier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR-2000, PerkinEl-
mer). For the FT-IR study, ﬁnely ground adsorbent has been
intimately mixed with KBr (Merck) in a ratio of 1:100 in orderto prepare a translucent pellet. From these FT-IR spectra thepresence of functional groups on the adsorbent were conﬁrmed.
The surface morphology of the activated carbon particles was
analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL-JSM-6380 LA, Japan). The carbon particles were mounted on sample2 A.M. Aljeboree et al.

(JEOL-JSM-420, Japan). The samples were then automaticallyanalyzed using computer software.
2.4. Kinetic experiments
Adsorption kinetic experiments were carried out using shaker
water bath. All of the dye solution was prepared with distilled
water. Kinetic experiments were carried out by agitating
100 ml of solution of a constant dye concentration with 50 mgof CSAC at a constant agitation speed, 20 /C176C and natural pH.
Agitation was made for 120 min, which is more than sufﬁcient
time to reach equilibrium at a constant stirring speed of120 rpm. Preliminary experiments had shown that the effect of
the separation time on the adsorbed amount of dye was negligi-
ble. Two milliliters of samples was drawn at suitable time inter-vals. The samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm
and the left out concentration in the supernatant solution was
analysed using UV–vis spectrophotometer by monitoring theabsorbance changes at a wavelength of maximum absorbance(599 and 403 nm for GRL and DY 12 respectively). Each exper-
iment continued until equilibrium conditions were reached when
no further decrease in the dye concentration was measured. Cal-ibration curves were plotted between absorbance and concentra-
tion of the dye solution. It was investigated the effects of the
following parameters to the removal rate of maxilon blueGRL and direct yellow DY 12 dyes on CSAC in the experiments.
2.5. Effect of different parameters of adsorption processes of
GRL and DY 12 on CSAC
2.5.1. Effect of initial dye concentration
The initial tested concentrations of dyes were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
14, and 16 mg/L for both dyes at different pH, temperature,
particle size, and mass dosage.
2.5.2. Effect of pH
The effect of pH on the rate of color removal was analyzed in
the pH range at 3, 6, 8 and 10 at 20 /C176C, 120 rpm, 50 mg ofCSAC (particle size 75 lm) and 100 mL of dye concentration
(2–16) mg/L. The pH was adjusted using 0.1 N NaOH and
0.1 N HCl solutions by using an Orion 920A pH-meter with
a combined pH electrode. pH-meter was standardized with
NBS buffers before every measurement.
2.5.3. Effect of solution temperature
The effect of temperature to the adsorption capacity of CSAC
was carried out at 10, 20, 30, and 40 /C176C in a constant temper-
ature bath at natural solution pH 6, 120 rpm 50 mg of CSAC(particle size 75 lm) and 100 mL of dye concentration
(2–16) mg/L.
2.5.4. Effect of mass dosage
The effect of mass dosage was studied by agitating in different
masses (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.5 g), at 20 /C176C, 120 rpm, 50 mg
of CSAC (particle size 75 lm) and 100 mL of (DY 12 or GRL)
dye concentration (2–16) mg/L.
2.5.5. Effect of particle size
The effect of particle size to the adsorption capacity of CSAC
was carried out in (50, 75, and 106 lm), at 20 /C176C, pH 6,
120 rpm, 50 mg of CSAC and 100 mL of dye concentration(2–16) mg/L.
2.6. Data evaluation
Adsorption kinetics investigations were carried out by agitat-
ing 100 mL of GRL, and DY 12 dye solutions of known initialconcentration with 0.5 g/L of adsorbent at a known tempera-
ture of 318 K, at pH of 6.0 ± 0.2 and at 120 rpm for different
time intervals. The amount of dye adsorbed onto the adsor-bent at equilibrium, q
e(mg/g), was calculated by the following

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Surface characterizations
In order to detect the functionality present in CSAC prior to and
after (GRL and DY 12) dyes adsorbed. Adsorption in the infra-
red (IR) region takes place (4000–400 cm/C01) due to the rota-
tional and vibrational movement of the molecular groups and
chemical bond of a molecule. The FT-IR spectra were obtained
to evaluate qualitatively the chemical structures of CSAC.(Fig. 2 (a)) shows the FT-IR spectrum of CSAC, which indicated
various surface functional groups. The broadband at around
3500 cm
/C01is typically attributed to hydroxyl groups. The region
of the spectrum of 2220 cm/C01is attributed to alkyne group
(C„C). The region of the spectrum of 1612 cm/C01is attributed
to axial deformation of carbonyl groups (C ‚O)(Cazetta et al., 2011 ). The presence of hydroxyl groups, carbonyl
group, ethers and aromatic compounds is an evidence of the lig-
nocellulosic structure of coconut shell as also observed in other
materials such as Brazilian coconut shell ( Cazetta et al., 2011 ),
and jackfruit peel waste ( Prahas et al., 2008 ), (Fig. 2 (b and c)
shows there is no real shift in our absorption peaks but the inten-
sity becomes higher after absorption, this is indicated as a
physical adsorption.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been a primary
tool for characterizing the surface morphology and fundamen-
tal physical properties of the adsorbent. SEM of adsorbentmaterial was taken before and after dye adsorption on CSAC(Fig. 3 ). From ( Fig. 3 a), it is clear, there is a good possibility
for dyes to be trapped and adsorbed into these pores. The
SEM pictures of adsorbed samples show very distinguisheddark spots which can be taken as a sign for effective adsorption
of dye molecules in the cavities and pores of this adsorbent. The
micrographs presented in ( Figs. 3 b and c) show clearly the dye-
loaded adsorbent coated by dye molecules over the whole sur-
face at natural pH conditions. The dye molecules seem to have
formed a void-free ﬁlm masking the reliefs of particles andporosity of the aggregates ( Kismir and Aroguz, 2011 ).
3.2. Adsorption kinetics modeling
Study of adsorption kinetics is important because the rate of
adsorption (which is one of the criteria for efﬁciency of adsor-
bent) and also the mechanism of adsorption can be concluded
from kinetic studies. Fig. 4 shows the variation of the amount
of adsorbed ( qt) as a function of time. The rate of adsorption
for both dyes is high at initial times of adsorption. For both
dyes most of adsorption takes place within 10 min which indi-cate that the rate of dye adsorption by CSAC is high.
In order to analyze the adsorption kinetics of GRL and DY
12 by CSAC the pseudo-ﬁrst order ( Lagergren, 1898 ), pseudo-
second order ( Ho and McKay, 1999 ), Elovich equation ( Low,
1960), and intra-particle diffusion ( Weber and Morris, 1963 ),
were tested. The result of ﬁtting is listed in Table 1 . A simple
kinetic analysis of adsorption (pseudo-ﬁrst-order equation) isin the form:
qt¼qe½1/C0expðkftÞ/C138 ð 3Þ
where qtis the amount of adsorbate adsorbed at time t
(mg g/C01),qeis the adsorption capacity in the equilibrium
(mg g/C01),kfis the pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant (min/C01),
andtis the contact time (min).
A pseudo-second-order equation based on adsorption equi-
librium capacity may be expressed in the form:

where Ksis the the pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant (g gm/C01-
min/C01), the initial sorption rate (ho, expressed in mg g/C01min/C01)
can be obtained when tapproaches to zero, Eq. (5)

The Elovich equation used for general application to
chemisorption. The equation has been applied satisfactorilyto some chemisorption processes and has been found to cover
a wide range of slow adsorption rates. The same equation is
often valid for systems in which the adsorbing surface isheterogeneous, and is formulated as:4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 50 052.856.159.462.75566778880.083.286.489.6T%

The intra-particle diffusion model based on the theory pro-
posed by Weber and Morris ( Weber and Morris, 1963 ) was used
to identify the diffusion mechanism. According to this theory,
the adsorbate uptake qtvaries almost proportionally with the
square root of the contact time, t½ rather than t, Eq.(7).

Fig. 4 represents the variation of dye adsorption on CSAC
with shaking time (0–60 min) and initial dye solution concen-tration of 10.0 mg/L. Fig. 4 indicates that while the adsorption
of dyes was quite rapid initially, the rate of adsorption became
slower with the time and reached a constant value (equilibriumtime). The initial faster rate may be due to the availability of
the uncovered surface area of the adsorbents. ( Kilic et al.,
2011; Shi et al., 2013 ).
All the experimental data showed better compliance with
chemisorptions kinetic model for GRL and DY 12 in terms
of higher correlation coefﬁcient values R2> 0.989. Moreover,
theqvalues calculated ( qe,cal) from pseudo ﬁrst-order model
were more consistent with the experimental qvalues ( qe,exp)
than those calculated from the pseudo second-order model.
3.3. Effect of different parameters of adsorption processes of
GRL and DY 12 on CSAC
3.3.1. Effect of pH
The effect pH was investigated on the adsorption of GRL and
DY 12 on CSAC at a pH of 3–10 for 2 h. The result in Fig. 5
showed that maximum adsorption of GRL, and DY 12 was
obtained at the lowest pH 3 while the lowest adsorption was
at pH 10.
As the pH of the solution increases, adsorption of both dyes
GRL and DY 12 was found to be decreasing; this was due to the
extinction of the positive hydrogen ions thereby promoting

of both dye and the CSAC surface ( Auta and Hameed, 2011 ).
While at an acidic pH, the functional groups of activated carbonbecome protonated, which are mainly the carboxylic groups
(/C0COOH
þ
2), phenolic ( ð/C0OHþ
2Þ) and chromenic group ( Al-
Degs et al., 2008 ). At pH 3, the surface charge of CSAC becomes
more positively charged, which enhances (GRL and DY 12)
adsorption through electrostatic attraction.
3.3.2. Effect of adsorbent dose
Fig. 6 shows the adsorption of both dyes GRL and DY 12 as a
function of adsorbent dosage. It is apparent that by increasing
the adsorbent dose the amount of adsorbed dye increases butadsorption density, the amount adsorbed per unit mass,
decreases. It is readily understood that the number of availableadsorption sites increases by increasing the adsorbent dose and
it, therefore, results in an increase of the amount of adsorbed
dye (Hameed et al., 2013 ). The decrease in adsorption density
with an increase in the adsorbent dose is mainly because of
adsorption sites remain unsaturated during the adsorption
reaction whereas the number of sites available for adsorptionsite increases by increasing the adsorbent dose ( Malik et al.,
2007; Yener et al., 2006 ).
3.3.3. Effect of particle size
Particle size of an adsorbent played a very important role in the
adsorption capacity of dye. The relationship of adsorption
capacity to particle size depends on two criteria: (i) the chemical04812160510152025

(its ability to formhydrolyzed species) and (ii) the intrinsic
characteristic of the adsorbent (its crystallinity, porosity and
rigidity of the polymericchains) ( Iqbal et al., 2011 ).Fig. 7 shows
the effect of particle size on textile dye adsorption.
Fig. 7 shows Minimum particle size showed greater adsorp-
tion than larger size. Small size of adsorbent increases the sur-face area for adsorption. The increase in adsorption capacity
with decreasing particle size suggests that the dye preferentially
adsorbed on the outer surface and did not fully penetrate theparticle due to steric hindrance of large dye molecules(Gouamid et al., 2013; Li et al., 2011; Rehman et al., 2013 ).
3.3.4. Effect of temperature
The effect of temperature on the adsorption of both dyes
(GRL and DY 12) by CSAC was studied within the tempera-
tures (10, 20, 30 and 40 /C176C) on adsorption at (2–16 mg/L)
initial dye concentration, pH 6, results are shown in Fig. 8 .
It was observed that the adsorption capacity of GRL on
CSAC ( Fig. 8 a) was higher than that of DY 12 ( Fig. 8 b). This
results may be ascribed to the vacant sites on AC used foradsorption were constant, and the molecular weight of GRL
was higher than that of DY 12. Meanwhile, with the initial
temperatures of dye solution increased from 10 to 40 /C176C, the
adsorption capacities of GRL and DY 12 decreased this may
causes an increase in the solubility of the dyes, resulted in a
stronger interaction forces between dyes and solvent thanthose between dyes and CSAC ( Dotto et al., 2012; Zhou
et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2014 ). A decrease in the adsorption
of both dyes GRL and DY 12 with increasing temperature is
related to the increasing Brownian movement of molecules insolution ( Li et al., 2013 ). High temperature might also lead
to the breaking of existing intermolecular hydrogen bonding
between GRL and DY 12 and CSAC, which is an importantcontribution to the adsorption process ( Li et al., 2013 ).
3.4. Thermodynamic study
The thermodynamic behaviors for adsorption of GRL and DY
12 on CSAC were further investigated. The thermodynamicparameters such as Gibbs free energy change ( DG/C176), enthalpy

equations:
DG0¼/C0RTlnK 0 ð8Þ
where k0is the apparent equilibrium constant, Ris the gas con-
stant (8.314 J/(molK)), and Tis absolute temperatures ( K).
The apparent enthalpy ( DH/C176) of adsorption and entropy
(DS/C176) of adsorption were calculated from adsorption data at
different temperatures using the Van’t Hoff Eq. (9) as follows:

For the adsorption of both GRL and DY 12 dyes on
CSAC, the obtained DHvalues were negative, which indicated
the exothermic nature of both dye adsorption onto CSAC. The
change in entropy was positive, indicating the entropy of the
system increased during the adsorption. However, it shouldalso be noted that the entropy of the universe (including thesystem and the surroundings) might increase because the
adsorption reaction was not an isolated process. The negative
values of DG/C176for both dyes demonstrated that the adsorptionTable 1 Pseudo ﬁrst-order, pseudo second-order, chemisorption and intraparticle diffusion model constants and correlation

3.5. Determination of adsorption isotherm parameters
The adsorption isotherm can describe the distribution of dye
between solid phase and the solution at a certain temperaturewhen the equilibrium was reached. The Langmuir, Freundlich,Temkin and Fritz–Schlunder (F–S) models were applied to ﬁt
the equilibrium data. Each isotherm model was expressed byrelative certain constants which characterized the surface prop-
erties and indicated adsorption capacity of this material.
3.5.1. Langmuir isotherm

vated carbon. Arabian Journal of Chemistry (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arabjc.2014.01.020(Langmuir, 1918 ). It also suggests that no further adsorption
takes place once the active sites are covered with dye mole-
cules. The saturated monolayer isotherm is presented by the
following equation:
qe¼qmKLCe
1þKLCeð12Þ
where Ceis the concentration of dye at equilibrium in solution
(mg/L); qeis unit equilibrium adsorption capacity; qmis the
maximum dye uptake, giving the information aboutadsorption capacity for a complete monolayer (mg/g); and
KL is a constant denoted the energy of adsorption and afﬁnity
of the binding sites (L/mg).
3.5.2. Freundlich isotherm
Freundlich isotherm is an empirical model assuming that the
distribution of the heat on the adsorbent surface is nonuni-
form, namely a heterogeneous adsorption ( Freundlich and
Heller, 1939 ). The equation is stated as follows:
qe¼KfC1=n
e ð13Þ
where nandKF[mg/g (L/mg)n] are both the Freundlich con-
stants giving an indication of adsorption intensity and capac-ity, respectively. The degree of non-linearity between solution
concentration and adsorption is n dependent as follows: if
the value of nis equal to unity, the adsorption is linear; if
the value is below to unity, this implies that adsorption process
is chemical; if the value is above unity adsorption is a favorable
physical process ( Kumar et al., 2010 ).
3.5.3. Temkin isotherm
The Temkin model proposes into account the effects of the inter-
action of the adsorbate and the adsorbing species ( Tempkin and
Pyzhev, 1940 ). By ignoring the extremely low and large concen-
tration values, the model assumes that the heat of adsorption (a
function of temperature) of all of the molecules in the layerwould decrease linearly rather than logarithmically with cover-
age due to adsorbate–adsorbent interactions ( Aharoni and
Ungarish, 1977 ), the equation is stated as follows:
qe¼RT
blogðKTCeÞð 14Þ
where bTempkin constant related to the heat of adsorption
(kJ/mol), and KTempirical Tempkin constant related to theequilibrium binding constant related to the maximum binding
energy (L/mg).
3.5.4. Fritz–Schlunder (F–S) isotherm
The F–S model is empirical three-parameter isotherm combin-
ing the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms ( Fritz and
Schlunder, 1974 ). It is based on the following equation:
qe¼KFSqmCe
1þqmCn
eð15Þ
where KFSis the Fritz–Schlunder model constant (L/mg), qmthe
amount of dye adsorbed (mg/g) when the saturation is attained,
andnis the Freundlich constant ( Batzias and Sidiras, 2007 ).
The coefﬁcients of determination ( R2) and isotherm param-
eters from nonlinear regressive method were listed in Table 3 .
A comparison of nonlinear ﬁtted curves from experimentaldata and four different isotherms at 283, 293, 303 and 313 K
is shown in Fig. 9 .
The Langmuir adsorption model was found to ﬁt the exper-
imental data for both dyes sufﬁciently in accordance with theliner correlation coefﬁcients ( R
2). The larger values of R2
(P0.9867) indicted the applicability of the Langmuir isotherm
for dye adsorption. qmwas an important Langmuir constant,
representing the maximum capacity at equilibrium. The differ-
ence of KLvalues between CSAC/GRL and CSAC/DY 12 re-
fers to the different in binding strength and capacity of thedyes with the surface of the CSAC, in general values of KL de-
creased with the rise of temperature.
The Freundlich model did not provide any information
about the saturation adsorption capacity as well as Langmuirmodel with lower R
2(0.9552). The parameters of KFand 1/ n
exhibited intense change at higher temperatures. The values
of 1/n(0.1 < 1/ n< 1) indicated favorable adsorption of both
dyes at experimental conditions. The Temkin model provides
calculation of equilibrium binding constant corresponding to
the maximum binding energy, KT, decreased as the experimen-
tal temperature increased from 283 to 313 K, which implies
that the adsorption process is exothermic and favored at high-
er temperatures. Moreover, it was observed from Fig. 9 that
the ﬁtted curves from the F–S isotherm were most near to
the experimental data at experimental conditions. Hence, the
(F–S) model was best to describe adsorption behavior at equi-librium. By comparing the four models, it seems that the modelof Fritz–Schlunder is the most adapted for the ﬁtting of
adsorption isotherms, then Langmuir model more adaptedTable 2 Thermodynamic functions DG,DSand, DHof GRL and DY 12 adsorbed on the CSAC.

4. Conclusion
Coconut shell, a food solid waste, was successfully utilized as a
low cost alternative adsorbent for the removal of hazardous
textile dyes (GRL and DY 12). The shifting of peaks in FTIRspectrum conﬁrmed the GRL and DY 12 dye adsorption onto
CSAC. The SEM study also made support to it by observing
difference in surface morphology of adsorbent before and afteradsorption of GRL and DY 12. Kinetics adsorption models of
both GRL and DY 12 dyes on CSAC were studied and mod-
eled using fourth kinetic models. The classiﬁcation of the ki-netic models according to the simulation of the adsorptionstudy is: Chemisorption > Psuedo-second order > pseudo-
ﬁrst order > Intra-particle-diffuse. Also adsorption isothermsof these dyes on CSAC were studied and modeled using fourth
isotherm models with more than two-parameter. An excellentprediction in all the studied concentration ranges can be ob-
tained by the three-parameter equation (Fritz–Schlunder).The classiﬁcation of the models according to the simulation
of the adsorption isotherms is: Fritz–Schlunder > Lang-
muir > Freundlich > Tempkin. Thermodynamic study dem-onstrates the spontaneous and exothermic nature of
adsorption process due to negative values of both free energy
change and enthalpy change.
