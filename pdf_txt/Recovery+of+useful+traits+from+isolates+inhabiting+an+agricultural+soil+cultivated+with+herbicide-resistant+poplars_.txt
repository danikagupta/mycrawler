Abstract - The occurrence of multiple metal-resistance was assessed in two bacterial collections, named Herbicide Resistant Bacteria 
(HRB) and Nuclease-Producing Bacteria (NPB) respectively, consisting of 15 and 11 isolates obtained from a loamy sand cultivated with transgenic white poplars (Populus alba L., cv ‘Villafranca’) engineered for herbicide resistance. A third collection of 11 bacterial isolates, named Leaf-Associated Bacteria (LAB), obtained from the leaves of transgenic white poplars expressing the StSy gene for resveratrol 
production and from untransformed plants was evaluated. Resistance to Cd, Co, Cu, Pb and Zn was tested. As for the HRB collecti on, 
nine different phenotypes were monitored, which included tetra-, tri- and double-resistance. Tri- and double-metal resistance o ccurred 
also within the NPB and LAB collections. In both cases five different phenotypes were recovered. An additional investigation wa s carried 
out on the HRB-1c isolate, resistant to Cd, Co, Pb and Zn, which was previously demonstrated to produce indoleacetic acid, a pl ant-
growth-promoting trait. Colorimetric assays, performed on the cell-depleted medium of HRB-1c liquid cultures grown in presence of 
heavy metals, confirmed that this trait was not affected. A 19-kb plasmid, possibly involved in the maintenance of the multiple metal-resistant phenotype, was detected in the HRB-1c cells.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays heavy metal pollution in soils represents a severe 
problem for environmental and human health and, unfor-tunately, remediation technologies still require consistent improvement (Lone et al., 2008; Mendez and Maier, 2008). 
Although phytoremediation is currently considered a promising strategy (Lone et al., 2008), a further optimization might be 
achieved by exploiting the beneficial effects of plant-associated bacteria (Jing et al., 2007). Microorganisms can enhance the remediation ability of plants, reduce the phytotoxicity of pol-luted soils and participate in heavy metal mobilization/immo-bilization (Siciliano et al., 2001; Jing et al., 2007; Kuffner et 
al., 2008).  Multiple metal-resistance, widespread in rhizobacteria (Diaz-Ravina et al., 1994; Ryan et al., 2008), involves differ-
ent mechanisms such as enzymatic detoxification of the metal, binding of the metal to cell wall and to other specific cell com-ponents, blocking of metal uptake by cells and metal extrusion by means of molecular pumps (Mergeay, 1991; Silver, 1992; Nies, 1999). To date, fast growing trees with high transpiration rates, such as poplar, represent a suitable system with a great potential in phytoremediation (Peuke and Rennenberg, 2006). Thus, the availability of bacterial isolates able to establish optimal tree/microbe combinations is considered as a valu-able tool to enhance the phytoremediation potential of elite clones. From this point of view, the white poplar (Populus alba L.) cultivar ‘Villafranca’ used in this work represents an ideal system, due to the high biomass production and resprouting ability (Confalonieri et al., 2000). In recent years, the same 
cultivar has been modified by gene transfer in order to acquire several agronomically relevant traits (Giorcelli et al ., 2004; 
Zelasco et al., 2006; Balestrazzi et al., 2006), tested with 
innovative marker-free gene-transfer technologies (Zelasco et 
al., 2007) and recently utilized for phytoremediation purposes (Castiglione et al., 2007; Lingua et al., 2008). 
 A study on the environmental impact of transgenic white poplars belonging to the ‘Villafranca’ cultivar has been also car-ried out, focusing at the soil level. Such an investigation was possible since a greenhouse trial was established using two dif-ferent classes of genetically modified (GM) white poplars: two transgenic lines expressing the bar gene from Streptomyces 
hygroscopicus, encoding an acetyltransferase able to inacti-vate phosphinothricin (PPT, the active component of Basta®) (Confalonieri et al., 2000) and two transgenic lines express-
ing the StSy  gene, from Vitis vinifera L., encoding stilbene 
synthase required for resveratrol biosynthesis (Giorcelli et al., 
2004).

 Two collections consisting of bacterial isolates obtained from 
the loamy sand cultivated with GM white poplars engineered for herbicide tolerance are currently available. The Herbicide Resistant Bacteria (HRB) and Nuclease-Producing Bacteria (NPB) collections have been already characterized in previous works (Balestrazzi et al., 2007, 2008). 
 The HRB collection, isolated on selective medium containing PPT consisted mainly of Pseudomonas and Bacillus species and 
some of the tested HRB isolates showed useful properties for biotechnological and agronomical applications, such as swarm-ing motility and indoleacetic acid production (Balestrazzi et al., 
2008). The NPB collection, isolated on a selective medium able to reveal the presence extracellular DNase activity, included mainly Bacillus species and a few members of other gen-
era, such as Brevibacillus, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas and 
Stenotrophomonas (Balestrazzi et al., 2007). 
 Besides this, a third collection, named Leaf-Associated Bacteria (LAB), has been produced starting from the leaf tissues of transgenic white poplars expressing the StSy gene for res-
veratrol synthesis (Balestrazzi et al., unpublished results). The 
LAB collection is made of leaf epiphytic and endophytic bacteria, belonging to the Bacillus genus, which have been extensively 
characterized for their tolerance to oxidative stress and to the antioxidant compound resveratrol.  Endophytic bacteria are considered promising tools in the field of bacteria-assisted phytoremediation and a deeper knowl-edge of heavy metal-resistant endophytic bacteria represents an essential prerequisite for effective phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils (Siciliano et al., 2001).
 The present work reports on the occurrence of multiple metal-resistance in the HRB, NPB and LAB collections. This inves-tigation will help identifying novel combinations of plant-growth promoting traits and multiple metal-resistant phenotypes for bacteria-assisted phytoremediation. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Bacterial isolates.  The HRB collection used in this study was 
recovered from an agricultural soil cultivated with transgenic 
white poplars (Populus alba L. cv ‘Villafranca’) engineered with the bar gene for herbicide tolerance as described by Balestrazzi 
et al. (2008). Briefly, soil samples (1 g) were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.85% NaCl and maintained under constant shaking (200 rpm) for 30 min. The soil suspensions were serially diluted and plated onto Plate Count agar (PCA, Oxoid) supplemented with cycloheximide (100 mg ml
-1, Duchefa Biochemicals) and phos-
phinothricin (PPT, 400 mg ml-1). Plates were incubated at 28 °C 
for two days. As for the NPB collections, the same procedure was followed, except for the fact that the soil suspensions, serially diluted, were plated onto Difco
TM DNase Test Agar with Methylgreen 
(DGM Medium, Becton, Dickinson and Company Sparks, USA) (Balestrazzi et al., 2007). 
 The LAB collection, including epiphytic and endophytic bacteria associated with the leaves of transgenic white pop-lars expressing the StSy gene for resveratrol production, was 
obtained from the GM lines 5EAC1 and 12EAC1 and from the untransformed line as previously reported. Leaves were collected from two-year old white poplars during the vegetative growth season (summer). Leaves were transferred to sterile tubes con-taining 5 ml of 0.85% NaCl and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, under constant shaking (200 rpm) in order to remove the epiphytic bacteria living on the leaf surface. For each poplar line, leaves were collected from three different plants. Isolation of epiphytes was carried out on PCA medium as previously reported. The same leaves were subjected to surface sterilization by shaking in 2% NaClO for 10 min, then washed five times with sterile distilled water. Leaves were then grounded with a pestel in small mortars containing 0.85% NaCl. Extracts were transferred to sterile tubes, debris were removed by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 5 min) and the liquid supernatant was treated as previously described in order to isolate the endophytic population.  All the HRB, NPB and LAB isolates examined in this study were maintained at -70 °C in vials containing liquid LB medium sup-plied with 50% glycerol. Aliquots (100 μl) were transferred from 
the stock vials onto Petri plates containing fresh Luria Bertani (LB) medium and bacteria were grown for two days at 28 °C.
Heavy metal-resistance. Resistance to heavy metals was eval-
uated on solid LB medium supplemented with 0.25 mM CdSO
4, 
0.3 mM Co(NO3)2, 10 mM CuCl2, 50 mM PbCl2 and 3 mM ZnSO4 
(Sigma-Aldrich). The salts were all dissolved in distilled water, sterilized by membrane filtration (Millipore Corporation, pore size 0.45 μm) and added to previously sterilized LB medium. The bacterial isolates were transferred onto the selective plates by means of replica plating. For each isolate, the ability to withstand a single heavy metal was first tested. Subsequently, the multiple metal-resistant phenotypes were further assessed by combining all the heavy metals in the same Petri plate. Bacterial growth was evaluated after incubation for 2 days at 28 °C. For each isolate, three independent experiments with three replicated samples for each treatment were carried out. 
Indoleacetic acid (IAA) production. IAA production was 
measured as follows: 4-day-old cultures of the HRB-1c isolate 
grown in liquid LB medium in presence/absence of heavy metals were collected by centrifugation; aliquots (1 ml) of cell-depleted medium were mixed with 4 ml of Salkowsky’s reagent (150 ml of concentrated H
2SO4, 250 ml of distilled H2O, 7.5 ml of 0.5 
mol l-1 FeCl3.6H2O) (Gordon and Weber, 1951) and incubated 
at room temperature for 20 min. OD535 was measured and IAA 
concentrations were calculated by comparison with a standard curve, obtained using purified IAA (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 μg ml
-1; Duchefa Biochemicals). Uninoculated medium 
with the reagent added was used as control. Three independent experiments, with three replicated samples for each treatment, were carried out.
Extraction of plasmid DNA. Exponentially growing HRB-1c liquid 
cultures incubated in LB medium supplemented with each single 
metal (0.25 mM CdSO
4, 0.3 mM Co(NO3)2, 50 mM PbCl2 and 3 
mM ZnSO4) were utilized. The HRB-1c cells were also exposed 
simultaneously to all the toxic metals while, as control, they were grown in absence of pollutants. Heat was used as a plasmid-curing agent (Gonzalez and Carlton, 1984). An exponentially grown HRB-1c culture was used to inoculate pre-warmed LB medium at 43 °C. The samples were then incubated at the same temperature for 24 h. The cultures were spread on agar plates containing the above reported heavy metals. Those colonies lacking metal tolerance were selected for plasmid extraction. To this purpose the plasmid-cured HRB-1c cells were grown as previously described. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density (OD
600). Bacterial cells 
were collected by centrifugation and plasmid DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi Kit, according to the manufac-turer’s instructions. Conventional agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out with 0.8% (w/v) agarose (Duchefa Biochemicals), using the standard procedure described by Sambrook et al. (1989).Ann.

RESULTS
Occurrence of multiple metal-resistant phenotypes in the 
HRB collectionThe HRB isolates (Table 1) were grown in the presence of toxic metals supplied in the form of CdSO
4, Co(NO3)2, CuCl2, PbCl2 
and ZnSO4. In a preliminary experiment, different doses for 
each elemental pollutant were used, based on the current lit-erature (data not shown). The results reported in Table 1 refer to the highest concentration of heavy metal that allowed the growth of HRB isolates after two days. All the isolates revealed multiple-resistant phenotypes which survived the following doses: 0.25 mM CdSO
4, 0.3 mM Co(NO3)2, 10 mM CuCl2, 50 
mM PbCl2 and 3.0 mM ZnSO4. Nine different phenotypes were 
monitored. As shown in Table 1, four HRB isolates out of 15 showed tetra-resistance. The HRB-7, HRB-8, HRB-9 and HRB-1c isolates could survive Cd, Co, Pb and Zn. Another group of HRB isolates was characterized by tri-resistance. This included the HRB-1, HRB-2 and HRB-3 isolates which showed resistance to Cd, Co and Zn while the HRB-10 isolate could withstand Cd, Co and Pb. Finally, the HRB-1a isolate was able to survive Cd, Co and Pb. The double-resistant phenotype was common to five HRB isolates: HRB-4 (Co, Cu), HRB-5 (Cd, Cu), HRB-6 (Cd, Co), HRB-11 (Co, Pb) and HRB-12 (Cd, Pb). 
Occurrence of multiple metal-resistant phenotypes in the 
NPB collectionAs previously reported for the HRB collection, the NPB isolates (Table 2) were grown in the presence of different metals sup-plied in the form of CdSO
4, Co(NO3)2, CuCl2, PbCl2 and ZnSO4. 
Results from these experiments, described in Table 2, represent the highest heavy metal concentration that allowed growth after two days. All the NPB isolates showed resistance to cobalt since they were able to survive 0.3 mM Co(NO
3)2. The tri-resistant 
phenotype was found in the case of NPB-2, NPB-3 (Co, Pb, Zn) and NPB-11 (Cd, Co, Pb) isolates. A variegated range of double-resistant NPB isolates was observed: NPB-1, NPB-4, NPB-6, NPB-8 and NPB-10 (Co, Pb), HRB-7 and HRB-9 (Co, Zn), HRB-5 (Co, Cu).TABLE 1 - Heavy-metal resistant phenotypes detected in the Herbicide Resistant Bacteria (HRB) collection

Occurrence of multiple heavy metal-resistant phenotypes 
in the LAB collectionThe leaf-associated bacteria (Table 3) were tested for their ability to grow in the presence of different metals which were supplied as CdSO
4 (0.25 mM), Co(NO3)2 (0.3 mM), CuCl2 (10 mM), PbCl2 
(50 mM) and ZnSO4 (3.0 mM). Also in this case, results shown 
in Table 3, refer to the highest concentration of toxic metal that allowed growth after two days. The LAB collection included iso-lates from untransformed (CTRL) and GM leaf tissues (5EAC1 and 12EAC1). Tri-resistance (Co, Pb, Zn) was recovered in two isolates deriving from untransformed white poplars, namely the EP-C-2 and EN-C-1 and in one of the isolates obtained from the GM line 12EAC1 (EN-12-2; Co, Cu, Pb). The double-resistant phenotypes occurred in all the LAB isolates associated with the 5EAC1 GM line: isolates EP-5-1 and EN-5-2 showed resistance to Co and Zn while isolates EP-5-2 and EN-5-1 were resistant to Co and Cu. Finally, the double-resistance to Co and Pb was a feature of EP-5-3, EP-12-1 and EP-12-2. 
Indoleacetic acid production in presence of heavy metals
Since in a previous work the HRB-1c isolate was found to be the most active IAA producer, additional experiments were carried out in order to verify whether this specific trait was maintained in the presence of heavy metals. Results from these analyses are shown in Table 4. The IAA content in the cell-depleted medium of 4-day-old HRB-1c liquid cultures was 21.35 ± 0.79 μg ml
-1 
(untreated control). In presence of heavy metals the rate of IAA production was always reduced. When single metals were sup-plied, the lowest IAA amount was recorded for Pb and Co (16.51 p 3.72 and 16.97 p 2.15 μg ml
-1, respectively). Sligthly higher 
was the production in cultures containing Zn, 18.30 p 1.43 μg 
ml-1. In presence of cadmium, IAA production corresponded to 
20.14 p 1.60 μg ml-1. Finally, when all the four heavy metals 
(Cd, Co, Pb, Zn) were added simultaneously to the medium, the resulting IAA biosynthesis, 14.65 p 3.27 μg ml
-1, was significantly 
affected.
Plasmid profile of HRB-1c isolate
In the attempt to assess the molecular basis of the tetra-resistant phenotype detected in the HRB-1c isolate, plasmid DNA was extracted from exponentially growing liquid cultures exposed to each single pollutant (Cd, Co, Pb and Zn) and to all of them simultaneously. Conventional agarose gel electrophoresis revealed the occurrence of a large plasmid (19.0 kb in size) (Fig. 1, lane 1). The same plasmid was absent in heat-cured cells (Fig. 1, lane 2). Differently from the wild type cells, the heat-cured cells were not able to withstand Cd, Co, Pb and Zn when supplied separately and in combination (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Aim of the present work was to fulfil the phenotypic characteriza-
tion of two different collections of bacterial isolates deriving from a loamy sand cultivated with transgenic white poplars expressing the bar gene for herbicide tolerance (Confalonieri et al., 2000). A 
third collection, including the epiphytic and endophytic bacteria isolated from the leaves of transgenic white poplars expressing the StSy gene for resveratrol production (Giorcelli et al., 2004; 
Balestrazzi et al., unpublished results) was also examined. 
 All the heavy metals investigated in the present work cause severe environmental pollution (Lone et al., 2008). When the 
HRB collection was analysed, resistance to several metal combi-nations was evidenced. The widest range of resistance included four heavy metals (Cd, Co, Pb and Zn) and it was found also in the HRB-1c isolate, belonging to the Bacillus genus. HRB-
1c is characterized by traits of agronomical relevance, such as a remarkable swarming ability, the consistent production of indoleacetic acid and the ability to stimulate the in vitro growth 
of white poplar explants (Balestrazzi et al., 2008). It has been reported that Cd can suppress auxin production of plant-growth-stimulating bacteria (Kamnev et al., 2005). The finding that the 
HRB-1c isolate could maintain IAA biosynthesis also in the pres-ence of Cd and other heavy metals enhances the biotechnological value of this microorganism as a tool for bacteria-assisted phy-toremediation. Resistance to Co was a common feature of NPB isolates and it associated with resistance to Pb, Cu or Zn, thus producing different double-resistant phenotypes in isolates classified as Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Microbacterium and Pseudomonas. Tri-
resistance, involving Co, Pb and Zn and also Cd, Co and Pb, was detected in NPB isolates belonging to the genera Bacillus and 
Stenotrophomonas (Balestrazzi et al., 2007).
 Multiple metal-resistance occurred in both endophytic and epiphytic bacteria. Tri-resistance was observed for all LAB iso-lates deriving from the leaves of untransformed white poplar and in the case of the EN-12-2 associated with the GM line 12EAC1. As for the GM line 5EAC1, all the tested isolates, epiphytic and endophytic, showed a double-resistant phenotype. Based on the reported data and considering the limited number of LAB isolates available, a discussion on the possible differences between GM and untransformed trees, in terms of leaf-associated microorgan-isms would be premature. However, it is worth noting that the LAB isolates associated with the GM lines 5EAC1 and 12EAC1 revealed a significant degree of resistance to oxidative stress conditions when exposed to hydrogen peroxide and UV-C radia-tion, respectively, compared to isolates derived from untrans-formed leaves (Balestrazzi et al., unpublished results).
 It has been hypothesized that endophytic microorganisms harbouring traits for the effective removal of pollutants can sig-nificantly help metal mobilization through the plant vascular sys-tem. This might be particularly relevant in poplar trees, where a prolonged time might be required in order to move contaminants from roots to leaves. Notwithstanding the several studies carried out on soil bacteria-assisted phytoremediation (Zaidi et al., 2006; Dell’Amico et al., 2008), to date there is limited information on 
the potential of endophytic bacteria on the phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils.  It has been suggested that the use of LB media supplement-ed with heavy metals could not represent the optimal choice to investigate the bacterial response, due to the possible chelation/precipitation reactions occurring in micronutrient-rich culture media. This approach has been however reported by different authors in the case of cadmium, lead, zinc and copper (Yoshida et 
al., 1998; Shakoori and Muneer, 2002; Zhigang et al., 2006).
 Since the HRB-1c isolate represents the most intriguing prod-uct so far obtained from our investigation, further analyses were carried out to gain information on the molecular determinants of its tetra-resistant phenotype. A single extrachromosomal element was evidenced by conventional gel electrophoresis in the HRB-1c cells. The plasmid (19.0 kb in size) was removed by heat-mediated curing and resistance to Cd, Co, Pb and Zn disappeared. The occurrence of larger plasmids, visible only using more sophisticated electrophoretic approaches, cannot be excluded. In a recent work, Pereira et al. (2006) reported 
that cadmium resistance was linked to high molecular weight plasmids while the czc cation efflux system, able to actively 
extrude cadmium, zinc and cobalt from the cell is encoded by a large plasmid (Nies, 1992). Moreover, plasmids which harbour genes involved in biotransformation of lead have been detected in Staphylococcus aureus and Alcaligenes eutrophus (Mergeay, 
1991). When considering the total number of isolates examined in this study, resistance to cobalt showed the highest frequency, since it was recovered in 94.59% of isolates. This trait is generally dependent on cobalt-transporting CPx-Type ATPases (Rutherford et al., 1995) and on cobalt efflux proteins (Thorgensen and Downs, 2007). Lead resistance occurred in 62.16% of the total bacteria examined. It has been reported that, in some cases, resistance to lead may be connected with production of extracel-lular polymers or with the intracellular sequestration of this metal by bacterial cells (Roane, 1999).  In contrast, resistance to Cd was found only in 35.13% of the isolates. Exposure to cadmium induces synthesis of proteins that export or chelate the heavy metal while the intracellular glu-tathione-mediated detoxification of Cd has been also described in the genus Rhizobium (Figueira et al., 2005). Finally, resistance to 
zinc and copper occurred with a frequency of 43.24 and 18.91%, respectively.  Detailed molecular analyses of the HRB, NPB and LAB isolates will be required to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the variegated patterns of multiple metal-resistance so far described. Additional studies will help distinguishing between the resistance mechanisms which rely FIG. 1 - Plasmid-profile of HRB-1c isolate. Line 1: wild type

on chromosomal genes, plasmids or transposons and the ubiq-
uitary metal tolerance ascribed to general metabolic responses. Mechanisms responsible for metal resistance might include exclusion by permeability barrier, intra- and extracellular seques-tration, efflux pumps, enzymatic detoxification, proteome and metabolome changes (Silver, 1992; Nies, 1999; Baker-Austin et 
al., 2006). Several studies have documented the predominance of Gram-negative bacteria in metal-contaminated soils  and this 
finding might be explained by the fact that the Gram-negative cell wall is a more efficient barrier to toxic metals than the Gram-positive one (Duxbury and Bicknell, 1983). In accord-ance with this hypothesis, although most of the environmental isolates (62.1%) examined in this study were Gram-positive, the tetra-resistant phenotypes were more frequent among the Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudomonas.
 The wide range of heavy metal resistant phenotypes rou-tinely isolated from soil bacteria might be related to the common agricultural practices which rely upon the use of metal-containing products, such as fertilizers, fungicides, pesticides and her-bicides, routinely adopted to enhance crop production (He et 
al., 2005). It is worth noting that both the herbicide-tolerant and resveratrol-producing white poplars grown in greenhouses underwent intensive fertilization treatments and nutrients solu-tions enriched in microelements were supplied to support growth (Balestrazzi et al., 2008). The heavy metals tested in this work 
include micronutrients such as Co, Cu and Zn which are essen-tial components of redox processes and cofactors of relevant enzymes (O’Halloran, 1993). It is known that bacteria possess copper resistance operons which display metal-responsive tran-scriptional regulation with membrane-spanning proteins involved in monitoring changes in copper concentrations in periplasm (O’Halloran, 1993). On the other hand, zinc is found in enzymes involved in transcription and in transcription factors respon-sive to a variety of intra- and inter-cellular signals (O’Halloran, 1993). Cadmium is the only non essential element evaluated in the present work. Resistance to essential elements is usually chromosome-based while the resistance to non essential trace elements is associated with plasmids and transposons (Silver, 1992). This is in accordance with the reported data linking the resistance to cadmium and the 19-kb plasmid detected in HRB-1c cells. Within this context the correlation between this extracel-lular element and resistance to Co, Pb and Zn remains difficult to explain. However, in case of plasmid-determined copper resist-ance mechanisms involving bioaccumulation, sequestration and efflux have been documented (Silver, 1992). Finally, it has been reported that heavy metal toxicity might be lowered in soils with high clay, since the charged clay parti-cles limit metal availability by sequestration (Collins and Stotzky, 1989). The medium-textured loamy sand utilized for white poplar cultivation in greenhouse was characterized by a reduced clay content (5.62%) (Balestrazzi et al., 2007, 2008) and this might 
have contributed to the high frequency of multiple metal-resist-ance detected in the bacterial isolates.  The response of HRB, NPB and LAB isolates to a wider range of trace elements, including As, Se and Hg, will possibly reveal additional resistance traits useful for waste bioremediation or biometallurgy. To date, microbial studies are required to identify novel soil culturable microorganisms able to support the phy-toremediation performace of specific plant systems (Lone et al., 
2008). The present work presents a list of novel environmental isolates with multiple metal-resistance which will be useful in future studies on bacteria-assisted phytoremediation with trees. The investigation focused on the capacity of HRB, NPB and 
LAB isolates to withstand significant heavy metal concentra-tions. This ability would suggest for potential applications of such bacteria in the field of in situ bioremediation of polluted environ-
ments. Specific isolates with multiple metal-resistance might be useful to target different elemental pollutants at contaminated sites. Furthermore, the ability to interact with perennial trees, e.g. those included in the genus Populus, might help to obtain 
novel plant-microbe remediation systems.
