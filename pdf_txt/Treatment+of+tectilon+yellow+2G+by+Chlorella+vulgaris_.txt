ABSTRACT  15 
Aim: The work was aimed at assessing the potential of Chlorella vulgaris in remediation of reactive dyes . 
Place and Duration of Study:  Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Plant Biology and 
Department of Biochemistry, Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria, between January 2019 and December 
2019.  
Methodology:  Wastewater containing individual reactive dyes: reactive red 198 (RR198),  reactive yellow 
176 (RY176), reactive green 19 (RG19), reactive orange 122 (RO122), reactive red 195 (RR195) and 
reactive violet 1 (RV1) were collected from a local fabric re -dyeing pit at Kofar Na’isa, Kano, Nigeria. The 
green microalga C. vulgaris  was c ultured in Bold Basal medium (BBM) at 30 ± 2°C and subjected to 
adsorption and decolourization assays of the dyes.  
Results:  The highest dye removal efficiency by enzymatic action was recorded after 48 hours, while that 
for the biomass adsorption was at day  14, at pH 11.3 and temperature of 30°C.  The percentage dye 
removal by  adsorption and decolourization were within the ranges of 68.1-97.8% and  69.8-99.9% 
respectively. Dye removal decreased with increase in contact time until saturation is attained. Freund lich’s 
isotherm model was best fitted for the adsorption of the dyes with a strong linear correlation coefficient, R2 
ranging from 0.954 -0.811 . There was a strong linear relationship and high statistical significance among 
the dyes for both decolourization  and adsorption ( P value; .01).  
Conclusion:  Chlorella vulgaris  was found to be effective  in the removal of reactive dyes from textile 
wastewater samples. The results revealed C. vulgaris  to be a cost -effective and eco -friendly biosorbent  
that can be used for the treatment of wastewaters containing toxic dyes.

1. INTRODUCTION  19 
Reactive dyes are the most commonly used in textile dyeing due to their binding capacity through covalent bonding with 20 
textile fibers and their affirmative individuality such as water -fasting, colour brightness and simple application techniques. 21 
[1] About 20-40% of these dyes are lost in the effluent which most of the times is directly discharged untreated into the 22 
environment. [2, 3] These dyes exhibit a wide variability in chemical structure, primarily based on substituted aromatic and 23 
hetero cyclic group s. They possess high solubility in water and thus, their removal from wastewater using conventional 24 
coagulation and activated sludge processes becomes very difficult. [4] 25 
Chlorella species are spherical/sub -spherical, unicellular, motile and photosynthetic microalgae found in all nutrient -rich 26 
aquatic habitats. [5] They are  described as  freshwater thallophytes rich in chlorophyll content which help in sunlight 27 
capturing for energy co nversion as such regarded as  freshwater pollution microalgae. [6, 7] Chlorella species grow fast and 28 
are able to uptake nutrients and bind to most of the toxic organic pollutants in wastewater. [8] Some organic pollutants in 29 
wastewater have been reported t o be eliminated by  Chlorella  species. [9, 10, 11 ] The removal of dye molecules from textile 30 
wastewater by Chlorella  depends on surface area, toxicity and chemical structure of the dyes [3, 12]; they were reported to 31 
be capable of removing dyes with very hi gh toxicity. [13] Fazal et al. [14] reported that the species have been effectively 32  used to detoxify dyes and nutrients in textile wastewater, thus, improving wastewater treatment. Acuner and Dilek [15] 33 
revealed that several Chlorella  species such as C. vu lgaris , C. pyrenoidosa and C. sorokiniana  were capable of 34 
detoxifying azo dyes by degrading them to aromatic amines which are subsequently metabolized to simpler organic 35 
compounds or carbon dioxide. Previous studies have shown that dye removal by Chlorella  species is mainly achieved 36 
through cellular adsorption or absorption which is dependent on the rate of algal biomass production. [16] 37 
Chlorella vulgaris  is a microalga having many structural elements similar to those in higher plants. It is fast growing, 38 
survives harsh conditions and resistant to certain invaders. It employs mixotrophic processes to take up organic materials 39 
from wastewater during treatme nt. [17] C. vulgaris is regarded as an efficient nutrient remover due to its ability to 40 
breakdown and remove toxic contaminants and nutrients in wastewater [18]; it also has the potential to degrade and 41 
remove azo compounds and heavy metals from textile wa stewater. [19] The treatment of dye wastewater with C. vulgaris  is 42 
an eco -friendly and effective option which recycles nutrients and improves water quality. [18] 43

2.2 Preparation of C. vulgaris  Biomass  53 
The green microalga, C. vulgaris  was obtained from Plant Biology Department of Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria. It was 54 
cultured in Bold Basal medium (BBM) in 250 ml conical flasks at 30 ± 2°C. [20] The pH of culture media was adjusted to 7 55 
before being sterilized by autoclaving (Laboratory autoclave Series 2100). [21] After cooling, the Chlorella isolate was 56 
inoculated and incubated at 30°C  on a shaker (Innova 4000) at 150 rpm; an air pump (Shining  Beach SB660) and 57 
fluorescent light with intensity of 2500 lumens (light/dark cycle of 12:12 hours) were also introduced to provide aeration 58 
and light respectively . The microalgal cells were harvested after fourteen days (at the log phase of growth) by cen trifuging 59 
at 1800 rpm for 15 minutes, subsequently; the cells were washed thoroughly with distilled water. A constant number of 60 
cells determined by counting using a Neubauer chamber (Marienfeld) [22] were used for the biosorption study.  61 
2.3 Adsorption and Decolourization Assays  62 
In this test, 4.47×107 cells/ml of the C. vulgaris  were placed in individual test -tubes containing 1.0 ml of wastewater 63 
(separate for each dye – RR198, RY176, RG19, RO122, RR195 and RV1) and 5.0 ml of distilled water. The initial 64 
absorbance of the solution was taken after mixing with an auto -vortex mixer and incubated at 30°C. The absorbance of 65 
the mixture was recorded using a spectrophotometer at 650 nm within 14 days. The amount of dye adsorbed per gram 66 
(Qe) of microalgal biomass an d percentage adsorption of the dye by the algal cells were calculated using equations 1 and 67 
2 respectively. [23, 24 ] 68

The Bold Basal medium from which the cells for the adsorption were removed was centrifuged at 10,00 0 rpm for 10 77 
minutes and 9.0 ml of the supernatant was dispensed into six sterile test -tubes, to each of which 1.0 ml of the respective 78 
dye wastewater was added and stirred. The initial absorbance of the test solution was measured at 650 nm and then, 79 
incub ated at 30 °C.  Subsequently, absorbance readings were recorded at intervals of 24 hours for 14 days. Percentage 80 
biodecolourization of the dye by enzyme activity was calculated according to Ozsoy et al. [23]; 81

Freundlich's isotherm was used to elucidate the adsorption process. A gr aph of log Qe against log B was plotted.  [25] All 85 
experiments were performed in triplicates and the numerical values were expressed as mean ± standard error and 86 
analyzed by one -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Microsoft Excel 2007 . Results were considered significant 87 
when  P < .05. 88

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON 90 
The percentage decolourization is presented in the Figures 1 and 2. The highest percentage decolourization  was 91 
recorded after 48 hours of inoculation, after which, there was a significant declination in the percentage in subsequent 92 
days and after the fourteenth day the percentage became constant.  93

The alga ( Chlorella  vulgaris ) was able to decolourize all the six reactive dyes from the wastewater sa mples. Similar 102 
findings were reported by El -Sheekh et al. [26] who suggested that C. vulgaris possess an azoreductase enzyme which 103 
may be responsible for the decolourization of a variety of azo dyes within a short period of time. Cheriaa et al. [27] isolat ed 104 
a new Chlorella  species and cultivated it in different textile dyes, reporting variability in the decolourization with respect to 105 
the dye type. Ishchi and Sibi [28] stated that C. vulgaris  has the potential to effectively degrade and decolourize a wide 106 
variety of azo containing dyes (reactive, direct and disperse dyes) at optimized conditions and as such can be beneficial 107 
for treating textile industrial effluents. El -Kassas and Sallam [29] also reported that C. vulgaris  has the potential to 108 
decolourize t extile wastewater containing azo dyes to a percentage of 75.68% using moderate wastewater concentration. 109 
In this respect, Acuner and Dilek [15] reported that several species of Chlorella  such as C. vulgaris , C. pyrenoidosa, etc. 110 0 20 40 60 80 100 120

 121 
The percentage adsorption of the dyes from the wastewater samples by C. vulgaris  is presented in Fig ure 3 and Figure 4.  122 
The adsorption was observed to increase gradually but after 14 days, a significant declination in the adsorption was 123 
observed. It was also observed that adsorption efficiency increases with increase in contact time, after which saturat ion is 124 
attained. This is also in line with findings of Pratiwi et al. [30] who used microalga Ulva lactuca  to adsorp methylene blue 125 
dye. Kumar et al. [31] stated that adsorption rate increases with time and on reaching complete saturation adsorption rate 126 
becomes constant. C. vulgaris  was reported by Lim et al. [32] to decolourize textile wastewater within a percentage range 127 
of 4-50% within 10 days. The dye removal may be attributed to the accumulation of dye ions on the surface of algal 128 0 20 40 60 80 100 120

et al. [34] stated that the ability of algae to decolourize substances is due to three mechanisms which involve assimilation 130 
and utilization of chromophor es for the production of algal biomass, carbondioxide and water, transformation of coloured 131 
molecules to non -coloured molecules and adsorption of chromophores on algal biomass. In another study by Pathak et al. 132 
[35] C. pyrenoidosa  decolourized methylene bl ue at a percentage above 90, while Seo et al. [36] reported 99.9% using a 133 
different Chlorella  species on the same dye. El -Kassas and Sallam [29] cultivated C. vulgaris  in textile wastewater, and 134 
observed that it could reduce its chemical oxygen demand (COD ) level as well as decolourize it. The decolourization is 135 
usually achieved through biosorption followed by bioconversion and biocoagulation. [37] The potential of Chlorella  species 136 
as biosorbents is because of their availability in both fresh and salt wate r, with their relatively high surface area and high 137 
binding affinity. [38] Algal biosorption of dye substituent occur as a result of electrostatic attraction and complexation of the 138 
cell wall. [39] The result of this study agrees with the findings of previous studies on dye remediation with Chlorella  species, 139 
even though variation occurs in accordance with the nature and type of dyes. Previous studies have also revealed that the 140 
mechanism of colour removal by Chlorella  sp. is mainly via biosorption which depends on the rate of algal biomass 141 
production. [16] C. vulgaris  have the potential to rapidly, efficiently and effectively remove reactive dyes (such as Remazol 142 
Red and Remazol Golden Yellow) and o ther dye types to very low concentrations by accumulating and degrading them 143 
through adsorption. [40, 41 ]  C. vulgaris  was reported to have high tolerance to azo dyes, having the potential to grow in the 144 
presence mono -azo dyes. [15] The ability of C. vulga ris to break down the azo bond which resulted in about 50.0% colour 145 
removal has also been observed by Lim et al. [32] in their study for treatment of textile wastewater with the microalgal 146 
strain. C. vulgaris  can be effectively employed to bioremediate dye s and nutrients in textile wastewater in order to 147 
potentially improve wastewater treatment. [14] The results indicate that enzymatic removal of dyes occur within short 148 
periods of time while, the use of biomass may take long periods, even though it revealed  high effectiveness.  149

The numerical values of the Freundlich’s model constants K f and N  are presented in Table 2. RV1 had the highest K f value 152 
while RY176 had the least.  153 
The Freundlich’s constants (K f and N ) explained the adsorption capacity as well as intensity exhibited by the algal 154 
biomass. [42, 43 ] The values obtained, show the adsorption to be a multilayer type which happens at numerous sites on the 155 
algal surface occurring gradually until complete saturation is attained. [43, 44,  45] 156 
 157 
4. CONCLUSION  158 
Chlorella vulgaris  was found to be effective  in the removal of reactive dyes from textile wastewater samples. Maximum 159 
dye removal in all the dyes with respect to enzymatic action was observed at 48 hours at temperature and pH of 30°C and 160 
11.3 respectively while the adsorption equilibrium was attained at the fourteenth day. Experimental data fitted well to the 161 
Freundlich’s isotherm model, signifying that a multilayer adsorption occurred due to infinite sites of adsorption on the 162 
surface of t he C. vulgaris. At the optimal operating conditions and dye concentration of 0.1g/ml, 69.8 -99.9% dye 163 
decolourization was achieved, while the adsorption was achieved at a percentage range of 68.1 -97.8%. There was a 164 
strong linear relationship and statistical ly significant difference (P < 0.05) among the dyes for both decolourization and 165 
adsorption. The results revealed C. vulgaris  to be a cost -effective and eco -friendly biosorbent that can be used for the 166 
treatment of wastewaters containing toxic dyes.  167
