Summary:  The study mainly focuses on the application of chemical Coagulants (Lime, Alum and 
Ferrous Sulfate) and Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) (Ozone Treatment and Fenton Process, 
alone and in combination) to treat textile industry effluents, optimization of coagulation process for 
various Coagulants in terms of process conditions, including coagulant dose, pH and settling time. 
The results revealed that Alum was most effective. The efficiency of coagulation process was dose 
dependent and 400 mg/L dose of Alum alone showed maximum color removal of 47%, 57% and 
54% of yellow, red and blue dyes, respectively in addition to the COD removal of 44%. The 
combined applications of Alum and Lime (300:75 mg/L) and Lime and Alum (300:75 mg/L) showed 
slightly better COD removal of 51%. However, color removal efficiency of all coagulants was at par.
The Ozonation process appeared the most promising for the treatment of waste water and color/COD 
removal, the efficiency of which increased with increasing the treatment time at constant Ozone 
dose. For less polluted effluents, 97% color removal was obtained after 1 minute and after 15 
minutes for highly polluted effluents; The COD removal efficiency of the process for less polluted 
effluents was around 89% after 5 minutes Ozonation and for highly polluted effluents 88% COD 
removal after 40 minutes. The performance of Fenton process was extremely low as compared to 
Ozonation process. Increase in pH, significantly decreased the color removal efficiency of the 
process. COD removal efficiency of Fenton process increased with an increase in settling time.
Key words: Textile industrial effluents, Chemical Coagulants, Advanced Oxidation Processes, Ozone 
Treatment, Fenton Processes, Colour removal efficiency, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD).
Introduction
Textile processing sector is one of the most 
important and largest industrial sectors of Pakistan, 
and accounts for 65% of country’s export, 46% of 
industrial production, 38% of employed industrial 
manpower, 9% of Gross National Product. The textile 
industry is water intensive and 20-350m3 of waste 
water is produced for each ton of fabric [1]. Textile 
effluent is highly colored and has higher contents of 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological 
Oxygen Demand (BOD) and dissolved solids in 
addition to the presence of toxic chemicals, 
detergents and oil and grease [2, 3]. The pollutants 
concentration however, largely depends upon the 
fabric quality, dye stuff and shade variation [4]. COD 
contents and color values in textile industry effluents 
were higher than permissible limits and require 
higher chemical consumption during treatment [3, 5]
and esthetically displeasing.
A wide range of techniques are being used
worldwide to treat textile wastewater [6]. These 
methods include chemical coagulation [7, 8],
biological processes [9], membrane techniques (REF) 
and advanced oxidation processes [5]. The Advanced 
Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are advantageous over 
traditional treatment technologies due to generation of hydroxyl radicals, which can oxidize a wide range 
of organic compounds and can remove color through 
oxidation cleavage of chromospheres [10-13]. The 
main objective of the study are: Treatment of Textile 
Dying industry effluents with Cotton fiber to 
optimize the coagulation process for various 
coagulants i.e., Ferrous Sulphate (FeSO 4.7H 2O), 
Lime (CaO) and Alum (KAl(SO 4)2.12H 2O) in terms 
of process conditions, including coagulant dose, pH 
and settling time, to apply the advanced oxidation 
process including Ozonation process, and Fenton 
alone and in combination to treat the effluent, and to 
determine the effects of process conditions such as 
Ozone dose, initial dye contents, iron catalyst 
concentration, Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)
concentration, pH treatment time and settling time on 
the overall efficiency of these processes.
Experimental
Textile waste water was characterized in two 
groups (Table-1) on the basis of pH, TDS, COD and 
ammonia nitrogen contents. These Textile industrial 
effluents subjected to different coagulation process 
(for various coagulants in terms of process 
conditions, including coagulant dose, pH and settling

time), advanced oxidation process (Ozonation 
process, and Fenton processes alone and in 
combination to treat the effluent) and to determine 
the effects of process conditions such as Ozone (O 3) 
dose, initial dye contents, iron catalyst concentration,
H2O2 concentration, pH treatment time and settling 
time on the overall efficiency of these processes.

Coagulation process
The pH of the waste water was varied from 
3 to 9 and it was dosed with coagulants i.e., Lime 
(CaO), Alum (KAl(SO 4)2.12H 2O) and Ferrous 
Sulphate (FeSO 4.7H 2O) as shown in Table-2. The 
coagulant was rapidly mixed for two minutes 
initially, followed by slow mixing for 30 minutes. 
Newly formed flocs were allowed to settle down for 
30 minutes, and the supernatant was decanted and 
analyzed following standard methods [33]. Settled 
sludge volume was also measured after each 
experiment.

Fenton process
500ml waste water was treated in each 
experiment. An optimal dose of Hydrogen Peroxide 
(H2O2) was determined by keeping optimal dose of 
Ferrous Sulphate (FeSO 4.7H 2O) constant. H 2O2 dose 
varied in the range of 0.5-3ml/L at constant pH (3) of 
the waste water. H 2O2 was quickly mixed with waste 
water for starting 2 minutes and followed by 30 
minutes of slow mixing; waste water was allowed to 
settle for 15-60 minutes and was then determined the 
overall removal efficiency of the Fenton process.
Ozonation process
Ozone was generated by using Ozone 
generators (ENALY, HGOZ/1000, USA) with Ozone (O3) production rate 1g/hr at air flow rate of 1.1 
L/minute. Ozone was bubbled through 200ml of real 
textile effluent via diffused fixer at the bottom of the 
reactor, in batch mode. The Ozone exposure time 
varied between 1-40 minutes and color and COD 
removal was determined after an interval of every 5 
minutes.
Color removal efficiency
The dye concentration in reaction mixture at 
different reaction times was determined by measuring 
the absorption intensity at 424, 516 and 620 nm by 
using UV- Visible Spectrophotometer since actual 
waste water had different kinds of dyes. 
Decolorization (%) was calculated using following 
relationship
D (%)  =  Co  -  Ct   x  100
       Co
where:
D% = Decolorization percentage
C
= Initial concentration of dye
Ct = Concentration of dye at certain treatment time
COD removal efficiency
Standard method 5220 B (APHA, 1998) i.e., 
Reflux method is used for COD removal efficiency 
[33]. COD reduction (%) was determined by using 
following formula
COD (%) = CODo– CODt    x  100
            CODo
where 
COD% = COD reduction percentage
COD
  = initial COD of the effluent
CODt  = COD of the effluent after treatment
Results and Discussion
Effect of different doses of different coagulants on 
COD and Color Removal Efficiency
The performance of different doses of 
Coagulants (Ferrous Sulphate, Lime and Alum) is 
shown in Table-3. It appears from the results that 100 
mg/L dose of Ferrous Sulphate demonstrates 
maximum color and COD removal. Beyond the 
optimal dose (100 mg/L), COD removal efficiency Muhammad Imran Latif et al., J.Chem.Soc.Pak., Vol. 37, No. 05, 2015 1035
was significantly reduced. Ferrous Sulphate dose 
above 200 mg/L substantially added pollution load to 
the effluent which is due to an increase in Total 
Dissolved Salts/ Total Soluble Salts contents. The
data regarding the effect of different doses of lime 
showed that COD removal efficiency was good at 
dose 100 mg/L. With the increase in lime dose, COD 
removal efficiency decreases dramatically because of 
an increase in Total Soluble Salts contents of 
effluents. In case of color removal, lime appeared to 
be in effective [14, 15]. It was evident that removal 
efficiency of Alum for all parameters was increased
substantially with increasing Alum dose, and 400 
mg/L dose appeared to be optimal thereby reducing 
Chemical Oxygen Demand up to 44% and color 
(yellow, red and blue dyes) level to 47, 57 and 54%, 
respectively.

Table-2 showed the efficiency of combined 
application of alum and lime. In case of constant 
Lime dose (300mg/L), an Alum dose of 25mg/L 
showed maximum Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
and color removal. Color removal efficiency of the 
system was better than Lime alone [16]. In case of 
constant Alum dose (300mg/L), a Lime dose of 
75mg/L showed maximum COD removal [17, 18]. 
However, color removal efficiency of the system was 
not better than the lime alone (Table-3). Results also 
revealed that combined applications of Alum/Lime 
(300:75) and Lime/Alum (300:75) showed COD 
removal around 51% in both cases. However, a 
combination of Lime/Alum (100:300) proved effective, and more than 50% color removal 
efficiency was obtained for all wavelengths [19].
Similarly, the application of Alum alone showed 
better color removal [20,21] as compared to Ferrous 
Sulphate and Lime alone (Table-4).

Effect of Ozonation process on Color Removal 
Efficiency 
The effects of Ozone exposure time, Ozone 
dose and initial dye concentration on the color and 
COD removal efficiency of the process is shown in 
Table 5 and 6. The color removal efficiency of the 
process increased with increasing the Ozone 
treatment time, which was a function of Ozone dose 
(Table-7). The treatment time decreased dramatically 
with increasing ozone dose [22]. At constant Ozone 
dose, the color removal (%) was however a function 
of Ozonation time [23]. The performance of the 
process significantly declined as the dye 
concentration of the effluent was increased (table 5). 
Highly polluted Textile Effluents (effluent 2) 
required much longer time for the color and COD 
removal as compared to Less Polluted Effluents 
(effluent 1). Undoubtedly, an increase in Ozonation 
time enhances the ozone contents in liquid phase, 
which overall boosts the degradation rate constant 
[17, 24]. However removal efficiency is increased 
trivially when Ozone concentration in the liquid 
phase approaches its maximum value [25]. This may 
be due to the fact that the process is controlled by the 
rate of chemical reaction and any further 
improvement in Ozone mass transfer would have a 
diminishing effect on the observed reaction rate [25].

The effect of treatment time on the color and 
COD removal efficiency of the process was shown at 
constant Ozone (O 3) dose of 5 g/hr (Table-8 and 9). 
Experiment was repeated seven times. Only 5 min 
Ozonation time was sufficient to effectively remove 
the dye contents of the effluents (Table-6) and Table-
7 revealed that initial COD contents (1154 mg/L) 
were reduced to 470 mg/L after 5 min treatment time 
and COD removal efficiency of the process increased 
with an increase in Ozonation time. The 
characteristics of raw and treated effluent after 
Ozonation (Table-10) revealed that Ozonation 
process effectively removed the color and COD 
contents [26, 27].
Effect of Fenton process on Color Removal Efficiency 
The efficacy of Ferrous Sulphate with 
respect to its dose showed that the dose of 100mg/L 
was appeared to be optimal for the color and COD 
removal (Table-11). Beyond that dose, the efficiency 
of the iron was not only dropped but also cause an 
increase in the pollution load due to the elevated level of solids in the effluent [14, 28]. The effect of pH on 
the performance of Fenton process (Table-12) 
revealed that the pH varied between 3-9, with 
maximum COD and color removal at pH 3. But 
further increase in pH decreased the removal 
efficiency which was due to the formation of Ferric 
complex which caused the precipitation of both 
Ferrous and Ferric ions [18, 29].
The effectiveness of H 2O2 for color and 
COD removal with respect to its dose (0.5-2mg/L) 
and settling time (Table-13) demonstrated that 
0.5mg/L dose of H 2O2 appeared to be optimal and 
showed maximum COD removal efficiency at 60 
minutes settling time, above this dose, the efficiency 
was dramatically decreased [13]. In case of color 
removal, 1mg/L H 2O2 dose appeared to be optimal 
and showed maximum color removal in the first 15 
min, beyond that increase in removal efficiency was 
insignificant [20, 13, 31].

In the study combine doses of Lime and 
Alum proved more effective. Similarly Ozone doses 
also show drastic reduction in Colour and COD 
removal efficiencies at different times. Ozonation, 
Hydrogen Peroxide treatment and Fenton processes 
are classified as Non Photochemical Oxidation 
processes [25]. Fenton process is cost effective, easy 
to apply and effective for a wide range of organic 
compounds with easy to handle chemicals [28]. One 
of the advantages of Fenton’s reagent is that no 
energy input is required for the activation of 
Hydrogen Peroxide [32]. Fenton process consists of 
four stages, first of all pH is adjusted to low pH, then 
reaction takes place at pH 3-5, then pH is neutralized 
to 7-8 and finally precipitation occurs [30]. These 
Fenton processes require less reaction time. On the 
other hand, Advanced Oxidation Processes are 
defined as the processes which involve production 
and use of powerful but relatively non-selective 
Hydroxyl ions in sufficient quantities [24], as these 
Hydroxyl radicals has highest oxidation potential to 
oxidize the complex compounds present in textile 
effluents [23]. Theses Advanced Oxidation Processes 
convert the dissolved organic pollutants in CO 2 and H2O. Ozonation has high efficiency at even high pH 
(>11) levels, because it reacts with almost all organic 
and inorganic chemicals present in the effluents 
indiscriminately [27]. Ozone reacts with reacting 
medium in two different ways; direct molecular and 
radical type chain reactions simultaneously 
depending upon the pH and concentration and 
composition of effluents [28]. The combination of 
Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide are used for the 
treatment of highly polluted effluents, the oxidation 
of whome is difficult and consume large amount of 
oxidant [19, 32]. Ozonation is low cost treatment 
method (with high initial cost but very low running 
cost) resulting in sludge destruction as compared to 
Lime, Ferrous Sulphate and Alum treatments which 
are sludge collection processes [27]. In Ozonation 
process, a photolysis of Ozone in water with ultra 
violet radiation in the range of 200-280nm can lead to 
yield of Hydrogen Peroxide producing Hydroxyl 
radical [22]. Different kinds of Ultra Violet radiations 
are use as source, among which Mercury vapor lamp 
is most common [25]. So it is recommended that 
Ozonation process should be used to treat these types
of waste waters.Muhammad Imran Latif et al., J.Chem.Soc.Pak., Vol. 37, No. 05, 2015 1038
Conclusion
Alum coagulant was proved more effective as 
compared to other coagulants. Efficiency of 
coagulation process was dose dependent. The 
combined application of lime and alum showed better 
COD removal efficiency as compared to alone 
application of Lime and Alum. Ozonation process 
was proved more effective and its removal efficiency 
increases with increasing ozone treatment time at 
constant Ozone dose. The effluent of higher pollution 
level (effluent 2) required much longer treatment 
time as compared to less polluted effluent (effluent 
1). Fenton process proved to be very low in efficacy. 
At pH 3, process showed COD and color removal but 
above this pH, color removal efficiency was 
significantly decreased. COD removal efficiency of 
Fenton process increased with increase in settling 
time. Ozonation is low cost treatment method (with 
high initial cost but very low running cost) resulting 
in sludge destruction as compared to Lime, Ferrous 
Sulphate and Alum treatments (27) which are sludge 
collection processes. So it is recommended that 
Ozonation process should be used to treat these type 
of waste waters.
