Abstract:  The discharge  of textile  azo dyes to the environment is an issue of health concern and can harm 
especially the aquatic ecosystem . The use of microorganisms has been reported to be  effective approach  for 
remediation.  Five bact erial isol ates with the capability of decolo urizing textile  dyes were isolated from textile 
effluent  and identified as Bacillus thuringiensis  (Isolate A2, B6), Bacillus badius  (Isolate B5, B9),  Bacillus 
aneurino lyticus  (Isolate C2) by different morphologic al, physiological and biochemical test s. Physico chemical 
parameters such as temperature, pH and inoculum concentration  were  optimized for the decolo urization 
process.  The optimum temperature, pH and inoculum size for the decolo urization  of three experiment al dyes 
(Novacron Orange FN -R, N ovacron Red FN -R, Terasil G reen)  were found 30 to  35 °C, 7.0 to 8.0, an d 10%  
(v/v) respectively.  The selected bacterial isolates showed different decolo urization activit ies for three 
experimental dyes. The isolate B5 ( Bacill us badius) decolo urized 98% of initially added  Terasil Green  after 48 
h of incubation at 35 °C in neutral pH . The present study  suggest s that the isolated Bacillus sp. can be utilized  
to treat reactive dyes containing waste water .

I. Introduction  
Synthetic dyes are  widely used in textile, paper, food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries  [1, 2]. 
About 60 – 80% of these azo  dyes consumed in textile processin g are characteriz ed by a typical double azo bond 
linkage ( -N=N -), which is the most common chromophore of reactive dyes  [3, 4]. The delivery of colour  onto 
fabric is not an  efficient process and up to 40 % of the dyes are lost during the dyeing process  [5-7]. Dyes  are not 
easily biodegradable, because they are designed  to remain stab le and long -lasting colorants. Dye colours  are 
visible in water at 1 mg L-1 concentration , whereas textile processing waste water, normally contain  more than 
10-200 mg L-1 dye, resulting in environmental problems [8]. Residual dyes  in waste water  and their breakd own 
products such as benzidine, naphthalene and other aromatic compounds are toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic 
to living organisms  [9-11]. Untreated dyes be come persistent  in the environment for a lo ng period of time. For 
example, the half-life of hydrolysed Reactive Blue 19 is about 46 years at pH 7.0 and 25  °C [12]. The 
physi cochemical methods e.g. filtration, specific coagulation  and flocculation  are effective but quite expensive 
and have many disadvantages and limitations  [13, 14]. The treatment process involving microorganisms  offers a 
cheaper and environmental  friendly  alternative for colour  removal in textile effluents.  The decolo urization  
ability  depends on the adapt ability and the activity of selected microorganisms. There are several reports on 
bioremediation of textile azo dyes based on many microorganisms  that are capable of degrading azo dyes, 
including bacteria , fungi, yeast, algae  [15-23], but these studies are  limiting. The  present  study deals with the 
isolation  of bacteri a from textile effluent , assessing their decolo urization efficiency  under laboratory  condition  
and optimization of the factors influencing the process.  
 
II. Materials And Methods  
2.1 Sample  collec tion 
Textile effluent sample s from Keya Dyeing and Knit composite Limited (KDKCL) , Jaron Bazar, 
Konabari, Gazipur , Bangladesh  were  collected in sterile glass  bottle s and it was from eight different locations of 
discharge. Immediate ly after collection, each sample was placed in an insulated box with frozen refrigerant 
packs in an insulated box and transported to the  Industrial Microbiology  Laboratory , Institute of Food Science 
and Technology (IFST), Bangladesh Council of Scientific a nd Industrial Research (B CSIR), Dhaka, 
Bangladesh. The samples were preserved at 4  °C until further analysis.

The textile effluent samples were enriched by co -incubating in Nutrient Broth ( HI-MEDIA , India) 
containing 100  mg L-1 Cibacron Red FN -R dye  at 30 °C for 48 h . After that , 100  µL of enriched broth was 
spread on Nutrient Agar  (HI-MEDIA , India) plate supplemented with 100 mg L-1 Cibacron R ed FN -R dye and 
incubated at 30  °C for 48 h . After incubation , bacterial colonies sho wing clear zones were isolated as potential 
decolorizing bacteria  as clear zones indi cate the ability to degrade C ibacron R ed FN -R [22]. Then f ollowing co -
incubation of isolates with a dye namely  Cibacron Red FN -R in Nutrient Bro th (HI-MEDIA , India),  the isolates  
were screened observing their ability to decolo urize the dye as measured by a spectrophotometer (T60 PG-
INSTRUMENTS, UK). These primarily screened organisms were stored at -80 °C (DF 8517, ILSHIN 
BIOBASE CO., LTD, Korea ) by liquid freezing and code d as A2, B5, B6, B9 and C2 . 
 
2.3 Identification of primarily screened dye decolo urizing isolates  
The identification of selected experimental organisms (A2, B5, B6, B9,C2)  were carried out  by 
observing their cultural  characters o n Nutrient A gar, PEMBA  (Poly myxin Pyruvate Egg Yolk Mannitol  
Bromothymol Blue Agar) media , gram staining and para -sporal body staining properties, growth pattern in 
different tempe ratures, pH, NaCl concentrations and biochemical  test results  (Motility,  I ndole,  Methyl R ed, 
Voges -Proskauer, Citrate utilization, Catalase, Oxidase, Starch and C asein s hydrolysis, L ysine  Iron  A gar (LIA) ,

Arabinose , Rhamnose , Trehalose , Meli biose , Glucose, Xylose , Sucrose , Mannitol , Arginine . All of these tests 
were done as suggested in Bergey’s Manual  of Determinative Bacteriology [24]. 
 
2.4 Media and commercial industrial dyes used in decolo urization assay  
A medi um was developed for decolo urization experiment. The composition of the medium (M) used in 
the present study was as follows: glucose (BDH, England): 8.0  g L-1, yeast extract (OXOID, England):  0.34 g L-
1, NH 4Cl (MERCK, Germany): 0.84  g L-1, KH 2PO 4 (MERCK, Germany): 0.134  g L-1, K2HPO 4 (BDH, England): 
0.234  g L-1, MgCl 2.6H 2O (MERCK, Germany) : 0.084  g L-1, Nutrient Broth ( HI-MEDIA, India):  2.0 g L-1. 
Media pH was adjusted at 7 .0 using 5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). The dyes used 
throughout the study were collect ed from 4H dying industry located at Karnafuly, Chittagong, Bangladesh. 
These are reactive azo dyes and frequently used in most of the textile industries in Bangladesh. Three textile 
dyes namely Novacron Orange FN -R, Novacron Red FN -R, Terasil Green were u sed in the present study.  
 
2.5 Dye decolo urization at different parameter s 
The medi um M was sterilized and supplemented with 100  mg L-1 filter sterilized experimental dyes 
(Novacron Orange FN -R, Novacron Red FN -R, Terasil Green). For  the  observ ation  of  temperature  effect 10 
ml dye supplemented media were inoculated with 10% (v/v) inoculum  of experimental isolates (A2, B5, B6, B9,  
C2) and incubated  at 20  °C, 30  °C, 35  °C, 40  °C temperatures. T o observe  the pH effect, 100  mg L-1 dye 
supplemented media prepared with different  pH (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) were inoculated with the isolates  and incubated at 
30° C and t o determine the effect of inoculum  concentration  100 mg L-1 dye containing media were inoculated 
with 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% (v/v) bacterial suspension  and incubated a t 30 °C for 48 h. The decolo urization of 
individual dyes was monitored for different time intervals  until 48 h . Each experiment was carried out in 
triplicate.  
 
2.6 Decolour ization efficiency measurement  
The samples were withdrawn from test tu be after incubation  and 1.5 ml was taken in fresh centrifuge 
tubes were rotated at 10000 rpm for 8 min s in a Micro centrifuge (MIKRO 120, Hittich ZENTRIFUGEN, 
Germany) at room temperature. The decolo urization  efficiency  was determined by measuring the abso rbance of 
culture supernatant  at 595.5 nm  using a T60 UV -Visible Spectrophotometer (PG -INSTRUMENTS , UK). This 
absorbance was compared with standard curve plotted using different concentrations of experimental dyes.  
From the standard curve the concentration  of residual dye was measured. Then the efficiency of colour  removal 
was expressed as the percentage ratio of the decolo urized dye concentration to that of initial one based on the 
following equation:  [25].

3.1 Identification of the bacterial isolates  
Isolation of dye decolourizing bacteria was carried out from textile effluent samples collected fro m the 
sites contaminated with wastewater from dyeing houses of Jaron Bazar . Five bacterial isolates with efficient 
decolourization ability against Cibacron Red FN -R dye were  isolate d using the technique described at section 
2.2. 
Selected isolates were iden tified on the basis of their morphological, cultural, physiological and 
biochemical characters. The test results are presented in Table -1. All the isolates recovered from textile effluent 
showed similar colony chara cteristics on Nutrient Agar and  PEMBA  (Polymyxin Pyruvate Egg Yolk Mannitol  
Bromothymol Blue Agar) . The morphological  characteristics of all isolates were identical  i.e. Gram positive 
rods (Fig. 1; left) , arranged singly, in pair and sometimes in long chains (B5, B9) and motile. They contained 
central (A2, B6, C2) and sub -terminal (B5, B9) spores, isolate A2 and B6 were found to have para -sporal body  
(Fig. 1; right). Toxin -containing para -sporal bodies are present in Bacillus thurengiensis  (Bt) when it observed 
under phase -contrast microscope [26].

vegetative  cells and para -sporal bodies  in 100 x magnification.  
 
Physiological characters of the selected bacterial isolates were observed  by subjecting those isolates at  
different temperatures  and different Nacl concentrations . All isolates showed good growth at 20 -40 °C but there 
was no growth above 45  °C and bellow 10  °C. With the increase of temperature from 20 ° C the isolates started 
to grow and the highest growth was observed  at 30-35 °C for all isolates. The selected bacterial isolates were 
able to grow well at 2% NaCl solution and growths were decreased with the increase of salt concentration and 
finally growth disappeared at 6% salt co ncentration . 
Following the comparison of the test results with descriptions in Bergey’s Manual  of Determinative 
bacteriology [24], and the isolates were found closely related to Bacillus thuringiensis  (Isolate A2, B6),  Bacillus 
badius  (Isolate B5, B9),  Bacillus aneurinolyticus  (Isolate C2).  
 
3.2 Effect of temperature on dye decolourization  
The isolates were used to study the decolourization of Novacron Orange FN -R (Fig. 2A), Novacron 
Red FN -R (Fig. 2B), and Terasil Green (Fig. 2C), at different temperatures  (20 °C, 30 °C, 35 °C and 40 ° C). 
After 48 h of incubation, the decolourization activity was measured at certain time interval (after 18, 24, 42 and 
48 h). All five isolates showed approximately similar decolourization pattern for these three experimental dyes. 
It was noticed that t he decolourization percentages of dyes were increased with the increase in temperature from 
20 to 35  °C and it was slightly decreased (which is not significant) with further increase in temperature up to 40  
°C. The highest decolo urization (91.33%) was observed at 35  °C for the Terasil Green dye by isolate A2. 
Therefore, the optimum temperature for the decolourization of these three experimental dyes bye the selected 
bacterial isolates were found to be 30 to 35  °C. This could be du e to the optimum temperature for the growth of 
Bacillus sp.  are 30 -35 °C. Similar to our result, the maximum decolourization of Reactive Red dye by mixed 
cultures was observed at 35  °C reported by Cetin and Donmez [27].  Bacillus sp.  was observed to perform  good 
decolourization at 35  °C in static conditions [28]. The decolourization of Red RBN dye by A. hydrophilla  in the 
range of 20 –35 °C [29]. The bacterial consortium JW -2 showed maximum 93% decolourization of Reactive 
Violet 5R at 37  °C found by Moosvi  et al. [30] and they also reported that, the decolourization rate of Reactive 
Violet 5R dye decreases further increase or decrease in temperature from optimum. The decolourization rate of 
azo dyes by many bacterial strains increases with increasing temperatu re up to the optimal temperature, within a 
defined range, and then there is a marginal reduction in the decolourization activity. The decrease in colour Biodecolourization of Textile Dyes by Effluent Adapted Bacteria

enzymes [31, 32].

Figure 2:  Decolourization of Novacron Orange FN -R (A), Novacron Red FN -R (B) and Terasil Green (C) by 
identified bacterial isolates at different temperatures (20  °C, 30  °C, 35  °C and 40  °C). The data is represen tative 
of three independent experiments after 48 h of incubation.  
 
3.3 Effect of pH on Dye decolourization  
Effect of pH on the decolo urization of Novacron O range FN -R, N ovacron R ed FN -R and Terasil G reen 
was determined at pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the dye supple mented media  M. Following the inoculation the experimental 
media  M were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h . The isolates showed  similar decolourization  pattern at different pH  
(Fig. 3A, 3B, 3C). All isolates were able to decolo urize the experimental dyes at a ran ge of pH 5 .0 to 9.0 but the 
maximum removal (98%) of  Terasil Green by  Bacillus badius  (B5) was found at pH 7 .0 after 48 h  of incubation 
period. But there was no significant decolourization difference at pH 8.0 in contrast to pH 7.0. Further decrease 
in pH below 7 .0 and increase in pH  above  8.0 resulted in decreased percentage removal of dye.  For Bacillus 
thuringiensis , Bacillus badius  and Bacillus  aneurinolyticus  the optimum pH for decolo urization were  close to  be 
7.0 to 8.00 (shown in Fig. 3A, 3B, 3C after 48 h). For most of the dyes the optimal pH for decolo urization was 
between 6.0 and 10.0 [33], which are similar to our finding s. Decolo urization of t wo reactive azo dyes Cibacron 
Black PSG and Cibacron Red P4B by Bacillus cereus  was reported under aerobic  conditions at pH 7.0 [34]. The 
results of our present study are in  also good agreement with Tripathi A. and  Srivastava S.  K., [35] who achieved 
highest decolourization  (90%)  of Acid Orange 10 (250 mg L-1) by Pseudomonas putida  within 24 h  at pH 7.0. 
Simil arly, Bacillus megaterium  gave highest decolourization of Turquoise B lue dye at pH 7.0 [36] and the 
optimal condition for the decolo urization of Acid Orange dye by  Staphylococcus hominis  RMLRT03 strain were 
at pH 7.0 and 35  °C [37]. The maximum decolouriza tion of Methyl Red by Micrococcus  strain R3  happened  in 
pH range of 6.0 –8.0 [38]. Decolo urization of Remazol Black B by  Bacillus  sp. ETL-2012 was found in the pH 
range of 5.0 –8.0 [39]. The optimum pH for decolo urization of dyes is often at a neutral pH val ue or slightly 
acidic/alkaline pH and t he rate of dye decolo urization tends to decrease rapidly at strongly acid  or strongly 
alkaline pH values [6]. The pH tolerance of decolourizing bacteria is qu ite important because reactive azo dyes 
bind to cotton fibe rs by addition or substitution mechanisms under alkaline conditions and at high  temperatures 
[40]. The fact that Bacillus sp . isolated during the current study  could decolo urize reactive dyes in  a relatively 
wide range of pH, make it suitable for practical  bio-treatment of dyeing mill effluents.

experiments after 48 h of incubation.

The effects of inoculum concentration  (5-20% v/v) on decolo urization of experimental dyes by the 
isolates  at different time points  were  measured. It was obser ved that rate of decolo urization was increased 
gradually with increase d inoculum  concentration . The  decolourization  percentage  rapidly increased till 42 h , 
then became constant at  all concentration  of inoculum . The decolourization of Terasil Green by Bacil lus badius  
after 48 h showed the best decolourization p ercentage (98%) was at inoculum  size (20% v/v).  The 
decolo urization of the experimental dye s used in this study by selected isolates (A2 , B5, B6, B9, C2) after 48 h  
did not show  significant  differences  (Fig. 4A, 4B, 4C)  at inoculum sizes 10%, 15%, and 20% (v/v) respectively, 
but decolo urization percentage was less  at inoculum size 5% (v/v). Hence , 10% (v/v)  inoculum concentration 
selected as an optimum.  Kumar  K. et al.  [41] reported similar finding when  they used  10% (v/v)  inoculum size 
during their work on aerobic decolo urization of azo  employing  mixed culture.  On the other hand, it was rep orted 
that a number of bacteria capable of aerobic decolour ization of azo dyes which included  Bacillus subtilis, 
Bacillus megaterium,  Bacillus thuringiensis,  Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Staphylococcus 
hominis  RMLRT03 , Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli  [20, 22, 23,36, 37, 42].

representative of three independent experiments after 48 h of incubation.  
 
3.5 Decolourization pattern  of various textile d yes 
Textile effluent consists of a mixture of various dyes. In our present study, the ability of Bacillus sp.  
(Bacillus thuringiensis , Bacillus badius,  Bacillus  aneurinolyticus ) to decolourize different dyes were studied. 
Bacillus sp.  was efficiently decol ourize the three structurally different azo dyes used in this research within 48 h . 
The highest decolourization efficiency of 98% was recorded by isolate B5 ( Bacillus badius ) in Terasil Green. 
Besides, the highest decolourization efficiency  recorded  by the  other experimental isolates in Novacron Orange 
FN-R and Novacron Red FN -R were  93.33% and 52% respectively. Our study suggested that the Novacron Red 
FN-R is more difficult to decolourize by selected bacterial isolates than other two experimental dyes. Si milarly,  
Kalyani D. C.  et al.  [43] repor ted that t he variation in the decolo urization of different dyes might be attributable 
to the struct ural diversity of the dyes. It is also believed that anthraquinone dyes are mor e recalcitrant than azo 
dyes [44]. 
 
IV. Conclusion  
The present study indicate s that effluent adapted  Bacillus s p. can be  suitable for the decolo urization of 
commonly used textile  dyes in laboratory scale . The decolo urization efficiency of isolated strains of Bacillus sp.  
against all the reactive d yes tested in this study was at satisfactory level which suggested that the isolates  could 
be used to decolo urize complex dyestuff effluent containing various reactive dyes.  Moreover, further research 
on these strains is required to  find efficient,  cost-effective, and eco -friendly  microbial solutions for the treatment 
of textile  dyeing industrial effluent s in large scale .
