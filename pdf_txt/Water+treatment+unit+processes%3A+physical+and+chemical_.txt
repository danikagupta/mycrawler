This book is intended primarily as a text for a course in water
treatment normally taught to seniors or ﬁrst-year graduate
students. The academic background needed includes the basicundergraduate courses in engineering, that is, mathematics,general chemistry, and ﬂuid mechanics.
The main thrust of the book was to delineate principles that
support practice. The ‘‘unit processes ’’approach was the
organizing concept. Most of the principles identi ﬁed are com-
mon to any kind of water treatment, for example, drinkingwater, municipal wastewater, industrial water, industrial was-tewater, and hazardous wastewater. The book seeks to iden-tify the strands of theory rather than to keep up with the latesttechnologies. The underlying idea was that technologieschange but principles remain constant.
The chapters are sprinkled with boxes which are explana-
tory asides. The idea of the boxes was to enlarge the reader ’s
perspective of a topic by including some of the lore andhistory. Understanding how we arrived at our present stateof the art places it in a more logical context. The book intendsnot only to provide technical pro ﬁciency but also to add
insight and understanding of the broader aspects of watertreatment unit processes. As a note, boxes of living personswere not included without their respective verbal permissions.In writing biography boxes, I did not consider personswho were of my generation or younger, albeit I know manywho would warrant such consideration, but perhaps from ayounger writer.
The book is organized as follows: Parts I through IV
(Chapters 1 through 21) are distillations of Water Treatment
Unit Processes —Physical and Chemical (CRC Press, Boca
Raton, FL, 2006). Part V (Chapters 22 and 23 and on bio-logical treatment) was developed for this book. The intent wasto abstract key principles of unit processes with minimalampli ﬁcation. The 2006 book is more comprehensive, with
additional theory and examples of practice. Problems areintended to illustrate principles, but with regard to practice.The SI (kg-m-s) system of units has been used; other metric
units have been used as needed. The equivalent U.S. custom-
ary units are shown in most tables and ﬁgures.

Foundation
Taking time to assimilate themes common to all unit pro-
cesses helps to put order and understanding into learningabout water treatment as opposed to a collection of facts andequations. Therefore, Part I describes some of the founda-
tions, or ‘‘building blocks,’’ of the ﬁeld. This foundation
constitutes the ﬁrst four chapters.
Unit processes : Chapter 1 describes how water treatment as a
topic can be disaggregated to unit processes, principles, and
technologies. Examples of treatment trains illustrate a varietyof treatment applications. These expand beyond the traditional
municipal potable water and wastewater to include tertiary
treatment, modi ﬁed water treatment, industrial process water,
and industrial wastewaters. The variety of applications isalmost without limit.
Contaminants : Chapter 2 looks at the variety of contaminants
found in water. Selected ones must be removed in order to
provide for further uses of water either as required by law or
as motivated by a private need such as for industrial processwater.Models : In Chapter 3, the idea of a ‘‘model ’’is described in
terms of its variety of forms. Models are at the root level ofdesign. We use models in everyday life ranging from mentalimages to photographs. The designer uses whatever may be
available, for example, inspections of existing plants, judgment,
rules of thumb, equations, mathematical models, physicalmodels, computer animations, etc. All of these are models andare means to project from the abstract to operation and design.
Reactors : The idea of the ‘‘reactor, ’’in Chapter 4, applies to
many unit processes. It is the notion that if we pass a dissolved
or particulate contaminant through a particular kind of ‘‘black-
box, ’’changes will occur. The reactor concept is the basis for
formulating these changes mathematically. The general idea
applies to a variety of unit processes, for example, settling,mixing, deep bed ﬁltration, adsorption in packed columns,
ion-exchange, membranes, gas transfer, disinfection, precipi-tation, oxidation, activated sludge, bioreactors, etc. The con-cept applies to natural systems where ‘‘passive ’’changes
occur, as well as to engineered systems.1Water Treatment
The topics covered in this chapter include a review of unit
processes, the genesis of water treatment as a technology, adiscussion of units, and an overview of how the book isorganized.
1.1 WATER TREATMENT IN-A-NUTSHELL
Any water treatment is done in the context of a treatment
train, a collection of unit processes. Such unit processes may
include screening, sedimentation, ﬂotation, coagulation, ﬁltra-
tion, adsorption, ion exchange, gas transfer, oxidation, bio-logical reactions, and disinfection. The aggregation selected,i.e., the treatment train, if applied to full scale with all of theneeded appurtenances and engineering to make it function ona continuous basis, is a water treatment plant (WTP). Theobjective of water treatment, by this treatment train, is to
effect a required change in water quality.
The water being treated may be any water, e.g., ambient
water used as a source for drinking water, municipal or
industrial wastewater, contaminated groundwater, brackishwater, seawater, or the product water from any treatmentplant. The treatment train employed in a WTP depends, ﬁrst,
upon the source water and the objectives for the ef ﬂuent water
and, second, on other factors, such as capital and operating
costs, reliability, ease of operation, traditions, current prac-
tices, etc. The relative importance of these other factorsdepends on the project at hand.
1.1.1 W ATERTREATMENT PLANTS
To bring into existence an operating WTP requires more than aconsideration of unit processes. A well-conceived treatmenttrain and the proper design of its unit processes is the heart ofany design. But much more is required to support the process
design. All plants must have, e.g., stated not in a particular
order, various kinds of sampling, metering and monitoring,control of ﬂows with pumps and valves of various types,
facilities for receiving and storing chemicals along with theirsubsequent metering and injection, safety measures regardingchemicals and many other aspects of plant operation, labora-tory support, utility tunnels, structural design of various tanks,hydraulic design for various purposes including setting the
hydraulic grade line of a plant, etc. In a plant with granular
activated carbon (GAC), transport of the treated carbon to andfrom the reactors must be provided along with provisionfor regeneration either on-site or off-site. In addition, the stor-age tanks, usually steel, must be protected from corrosion.The distinction between the design of water treatmentprocesses and a WTP is between principle and implementation.The process principles must be adhered to but they must beprovided the means for being implemented, i.e., in terms of aplant. The latter is not excluded in this book, but is not the mainfocus. The two areas are complementary. Process design can betaught in school. But in putting it all together, experience ismost important.
1.1.2 R ESIDUALS
As an axiom of water treatment, residuals are always aby-product. They are unwanted, but must be dealt with. Forexample, in membrane treatment, the ‘‘concentrate ’’water
ﬂow is often limiting with respect to the feasibility of an
installation. The residuals stream in water treatment includes
the sludge from settling basins and the backwash water ofﬁltration. Settling ponds must be provided to decant thewater and to dispose of the resulting sludge. In wastewatertreatment, a variety of treatment trains may be employed toprocess the solid streams, with some kind of recycle ordisposal being the end result.
Some of these required tasks can be taught and other aspects
must be learned by experience. Some introduction is helpful,but experience and visits to installations is essential. Manyquestions can be answered readily and the problems may beput into perspective by visits to plants complemented by dis-cussions with operators and experienced engineers.
1.2 ORGANIZATION OF WATER TREATMENT
KNOWLEDGE
Common themes in organizing water knowledge include
1. Treatment for a particular purpose, such as for drink-
ing water, wastewater, industrial wastewater, andcontaminated groundwater
2. Treatment of particular contaminants
3. Unit processes
From about 1880 to 1960, knowledge developed along the
lines of the ﬁrst approach, i.e., drinking water treatment,
wastewater treatment, and industrial wastes treatment. Thentreatment of hazardous wastes emerged about 1980, employ-ing some of the same unit processes. Desalting of brackishwaters and seawater became issues beginning about 1960.
Thus, we have had books and persons who think along the
lines of drinking water treatment and others who think ofmunicipal wastewater treatment, with commensurate booksand journals, and yet another group who specializes in treat-ment of industrial wastes, etc.
3In some cases, the paradigm for thinking has been along
the lines of treatment for speci ﬁc contaminants, mostly those
that are regulated, or perhaps those that pose an industry
problem. For example, halogenated hydrocarbons have been
regulated in drinking water in 1978 starting with tri-halo-methanes. Nutrients in wastewater have been a treatmentfocus since the early 1970s as a means to reduce algae bloomsin ambient waters. Heavy metals, an industrial waste problem,have also been regulated since the 1970s. There are books aswell as articles dedicated to these topics.
In the 1960s, some in the academic community began to
adopt the unit operations =unit processes approach in organiz-
ing the knowledge of water treatment. This approach wasinspired by two books, Unit Operations of Sanitary Engineer-
ing(Rich, 1961) and Unit Processes of Sanitary Engineering
(Rich, 1963), and reinforced by persons pursuing graduatedegrees who had taken courses in chemical engineering.
In comparing the three approaches, the ﬁrst is limited in
perspective to the problem area at hand (e.g., drinking water
treatment, municipal wastewater treatment, industrial waste-
water treatment, and hazardous wastes treatment). Screening,e.g., as a bar screen in wastewater treatment is viewed as a meansto protect pumps from items that might cause clogging. In watertreatment, screening may be a microscreen to remove algae. As aunit process, screening is a means to retain objects and particlesfor whatever purpose. The difference is in the viewpoint. Theﬁrst two are by nature empirical and speci ﬁc, while the third is
adaptable to the purpose without the constraints of tradition.With the ﬁrst two approaches, one lacks the broad perspective
that screening may be applied to any problem area.
In this book, we use the unit processes approach. The unit
process approach includes operative principles, traditions,practices, empirical methods, technology forms, and the spec-trum of applications.1.3 UNIT PROCESSES
This book presents the topic of water treatment in terms ofunit processes, which are discussed in the following chapters.For each unit process considered, principles and practices areexplained. The unit processes approach is common to the ﬁeld
of chemical engineering and has been assimilated by the ﬁeld
of environmental engineering.
1.3.1 D EFINITIONS
A water treatment unit process is de ﬁn e da sa ne n g i n e e r e d
system to effect certain intended state changes for the water.Examples include screening, gravity settling, coagulation,ﬂocculation, ﬁltration, gas transfer, ion exchange, adsorp-
tion, membrane separations, biological treatment, disinfec-tion, oxidation, and chemical precipitation (Sanks, 1978;
Letterman, 1999). These unit processes are the topics of this
book. Some of the de ﬁnitions are as follows:
.Screening . The retention of a substance by a screen
that has a mesh size smaller than the substance to beretained.
.Gravity settling . A particle falling under the in ﬂu-
ence of gravity is called sedimentation.
.Coagulation . The charge neutralization of a nega-
tively charged colloid, usually by chemical means,such as the use of alum or a ferric compound.
.Flocculation . A unit process that promotes collisions
between particles that attach to each other uponcontact, growing in size to increase settling velocity.
.Filtration . The convection of a water stream through
a porous media with the intent to retain suspended
particles within the media.
.Gas transfer . The transport of gas between the dis-
solved phase in water and a gas phase.
.Ion exchange . The exchange of benign ions (such as
Naþ) bonded to sites within an ion-exchange mater-
ial (such as a zeolite mineral or a synthetic resin)
intended to be displaced by an ion targeted forremoval (such as Ca
2þ) that has a stronger bonding
force.
.Adsorption. The attachment of a molecule to anadsorption site provided by an internal surface ofan adsorbent material. Activated carbon is the best-known adsorbent for an engineered system, althoughvirtually any solid material can provide adsorptionsites.
.Membrane separation . The four types of membrane
processes are as follows:
1. Micro ﬁltration (removes colloids and bacteria)
2. Ultra ﬁltration (removes viruses)
3. Nano- ﬁltration (removes large molecular weight
organic molecules and some ions)
4. Hyper- ﬁltration, more commonly called ‘‘reverse
osmosis ’’(removes molecules and ions)BOX 1.1 CONTEXT AND FIT
A particular type of situation is the context for a design
and has to do with water quality, treatment objectives,operation capabilities, ﬁnancing, etc. The form is the unit
process =technology adopted. The ﬁtis the relationship
between the context and the form.A nappropriate ﬁti s
desired. In other words, the process =technology selected
must be appropriate for the context. These ideas arecentral to design.
As an example, a slow sand ﬁlter may be appropriate
technology for a small community, since materials areavailable locally, operation is ‘‘passive, ’’i.e., not requir-
ing operator skill, and parts are simple and easilyrepaired locally. On the other hand, slow sand maynot be appropriate for a large community as the laborrequirement is much more than for a rapid rate plant.For the latter, automation is feasible and parts andskilled labor are likely to be readily available.4 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and BiologicalThe membrane processes are different in pore size and in
pressures required; de ﬁned pores may be lacking, in fact, for
the latter two membrane processes:
.Biological treatment . A reaction between an organic
molecule and a microorganism
.Disinfection . The inactivation of microorganisms
.Oxidation . The gain of electrons by chemical
reaction
.Precipitation . The formation of a solid substance
from ions in solution
To the extent possible, these unit processes are described
in terms of principles. As a rule, however, scientiﬁ c
principles alone do not provide for a ‘‘complete ’’engineering
solution.
Engineering has the characteristic that a solution to a
problem is the important thing. A problem to be solvedcannot wait for a rational explanation. So while the scienti ﬁc
explanation is sought, it is often necessary to make do withsome means to make a decision about design. Such methodsmay involve judgment, a knowledge of scienti ﬁc principles,
modeling, laboratory testing, lore concerning how thingshave been done in the past, rules of thumb, the use of somekind of calculation method such as a loading rate, associated
criteria, etc. Thus, while the book describes what is known
as the rationale for a process design, methods used inpractice are reviewed also. (The view taken here is thatthe foregoing provides a means for decision-making.Scienti ﬁc certainty and accuracy are sought, but the main
t h i n gi st op r o v i d eab a s i sf o ra c h i e v i n gad e ﬁned level of
system performance and doing so economically and withas o c i a l ‘‘ﬁt.’’)
A ‘‘state ’’is deﬁned here as the water quality character-
istics of a given parcel of water and may include concentra-tions of suspended solids (including organisms), ions, andmolecules; temperature; pH; etc. A treatment ‘‘process ’’is
intended to cause a desired change of the state of a volumeof water. The idea of a water quality ‘‘state ’’was taken from
theﬁeld of physical chemistry in which the state of a gas is
deﬁned by its temperature, pressure, and volume.
1.3.2 T ECHNOLOGIES
For a given unit process, a technology is a means for imple-mentation. For example, a rapid ﬁlter is a means to imple-
ment a ‘‘deep-bed ’’ﬁltration process. The rapid ﬁlter
includes the array of appurtenances to make it work, e.g.,theﬁlter box depth and area, under-drain system, and back-
wash system. Rules of thumb, tradition, and manufacturer ’s
standards govern the sizing and characteristics of eachcomponent.
In short, a technology is a ‘‘package ’’of design guide-
lines and components that result in a system that supportsa workable process. The manufacturer may provide acomplete package or some of all of the supporting components.1.3.3 B READTH OF UNITPROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGIES
To illustrate the idea further, Table 1.1 lists some 15 unitprocesses with samples of associated treatment technologies.The list of associated technologies is not complete, nor does itshow the range of variation. The technologies are listed gen-erically. If proprietary technologies were listed, Table 1.1
might be several pages long. All of this is mentioned so that
one may gain an appreciation for the breadth of the number oftechnologies that have been developed.
Table CD1.2 is an excerpt from a matrix with some 700
contaminants listed in rows and 11 basic unit processes listedin columns with selected technologies under each unit process(Champlin and Hendricks, 1993). Columns further to the rightlist variations. Looking down the columns, the contaminants
that may be subject to treatment by a given technology are
designated by a code in the intersecting cell based upon theexpected percent removal. The matrix expands on what isshown in Table 1.1 but includes a listing of contaminants.Table CD1.2a shows an overall layout of the matrix, i.e.,how to navigate, while Table CD1.2b is the large matrixwith some 700 rows and 100 columns. The idea of the largematrix is to give an appreciation for the scope of water
treatment as a ﬁeld of practice.
1.3.4 P ROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES
Proprietary innovation plays a large part in technologies.
Several manufacturers offer their own ‘‘packages ’’of tech-
nology for the deep-bed ﬁltration process, for example. To
illustrate, the Parkson Dynasand tﬁlter is a moving bed ﬁlter
that takes off the ﬂoc-saturated media at the bottom, replen-
ishes the ﬁlter bed at the top, and so backwash is not
required. The Culligan Multi-Tech tﬁlter is a complete pack-
age plant that provides the means for ﬂocculation within a
coarse media preceding the main ﬁlter and is designed for
the complete automation of the ﬁltration process. The In ﬁlco-
Dregemont ABW t(automatic backwash) ﬁltration system is
a shallow-bed ﬁlter comprised of a series of transverse cells
305 mm (1.0 ft) wide. A traveling bridge with a hood tocollect the backwash ﬂow and a backwash pump with ‘‘shoe ’’
that places the backwash plumbing over the under-drain open-ing in the ﬁnished water channel provides for a short
duration backwash of a single cell. The bridge moves thento the next cell and the ﬁlter as a whole is never taken out
of operation.
Theﬁltration example illustrates the role of proprietary
companies in making successful a given process. Essentially,an array of proprietary technologies have been developed for
each unit process either to provide support for a generic
design such as ancillary equipment or to provide a full oper-ational package technology. Two or three of the unit pro-cesses have been developed largely under the impetus ofproprietary research. An example is the membrane processesthat have evolved commercially since the 1960s and havereached the status of widespread use.Water Treatment 5TABLE 1.1

The treatment of water became an issue in the ﬁrst decades of the
nineteenth century with drinking water. In this context, James
Simpson developed the slow sand ﬁltration technology for Lon-
don, enumerating design guidelines and support components tohave a workable process. Slow sand became an accepted tech-
nology for drinking water by the 1870s and was in widespread
use, particularly in Europe, by 1890, where it was creditedwith saving Altoona, Germany, from a cholera epidemic. Thetreatment of wastewaters became an issue after 1860 in Englandwhere chemical precipitation became one of the ﬁrst unit pro-
cesses, but did not develop into widespread use. In 1880, theLawrence Experiment Station was established (Massachusetts,1953) that later led in the development of several technologies,including trickling ﬁlters, and where experimentation inspired
Ardern and Lockett to develop activated sludge in England in
1914. Settling, called ‘‘subsidence, ’’was well established by
1900; the technology was cheap and was an obvious alternative.
By 1885, deep-bed ﬁltration was an innovation that by 1900 had
become established in America. In Europe, Klaus Imhoff devel-oped the Imhoff Tank about 1905 and Cameron in Englanddeveloped the septic tank. How the stage was set for the devel-opment of environmental engineering as a ﬁeld from Ancient
times to 1900 was reviewed by Symons (2001).
Ion exchange had been known scienti ﬁcally by early 1800,
and became an established technology for softening by 1924using zeolites. The use of chlorine, ozone, and ultraviolet radi-ation as disinfectants were established by 1900. Ozone wasadopted widely in Europe, while chlorine became establishedin America. By the third decade of the twentieth century, gas-eous chlorine became the technology of choice (in the UnitedStates). Advances in the application of technologies have con-
tinued over the following decades. The point is that water
treatment technologies have been developing and expandingstarting only since 1829 with slow sand. The impetus has beensocietal issues that were recognized as government responsibil-ities with advances through research and practice.TABLE 1.1 (continued)

There is little doubt that technologies will continue to evolve,
particularly if the market exists for improved applications ofunit processes. Looking at the unit processes, some 15 arelisted in Table 1.1; they were identi ﬁed based upon funda-
mental principles. Of the 15 identi ﬁed, and looking at the
underlying principles of each, the question would be asfollows: Could principles not yet used be applied for separat-ing contaminants from water? While any predictions areuncertain by nature, we could say with safety that any newones would have to be based on remaining principles that maycause a change of state of a substance.
1.3.7 E NERGY EXPENDITURE FOR TREATMENT
A fundamental axiom of any treatment process is that a separ-ation is involved. The separations involve removing particlesfrom water, ions from water, and molecules from water. In eachcase the principle is that the entropy of the particles, ions, or
molecules must be reduced. By the second law of thermo-
dynamics this can occur only by an input of energy. Anytreatment process cannot violate the principle of the secondlaw. In other words, energy must be expended to effect anykind of separation. Then to make any process feasible from an
engineering point of view, there must be a compromise
between energy cost and the speed of the process (the moreirreversible the process, the higher is its velocity, but the higherthe energy cost). The second law places an inherent limit onwhat may be expected.
1.4 TREATMENT TRAINS
The con ﬁgurations of unit processes that may comprise treat-
ment trains are perhaps as numerous as there are combinations of
the unit processes listed in Table 1.1. Those that are most
common are (1) for potable water and (2) for wastewater.Figure 1.1 shows schematic sketches of treatment trains forpotable water, Figure 1.1a, and for municipal wastewater treat-ment, Figure 1.1b, respectively. To illustrate the latter, Figure 1.2shows an aerial photograph of the wastewater treatment plant(WWTP) for the City of Colorado Springs, c. 1972.
The unit processes shown for Figure 1.1a and b are com-
mon, but considerable variation is possible. For example, inpotable water treatment, Figure 1.1a, plain sedimentation maybe omitted if the source is a lake. A variation in the ﬁltration
process, called ‘‘in-line ’’ﬁltration, omits ﬂocculation and

FIGURE 1.1 Treatment trains —schematic drawings: (a) potable water and (b) municipal wastewater.8 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and Biologicalsettling. For disinfection, chlorine has been traditional in the
United States, while ozone is common in Europe. In munici-pal wastewater treatment, as in Figure 1.1b, ﬁner bar screens
have been used in lieu of comminutors; also, tertiary treatmentcould be added.
The selection of unit processes depends upon the contam-
inants present in the source water and the objectives to beachieved by treatment. The selection of technologies dependson contextual factors; costs; preferences of the client; and theengineer ’s vision, experience, and knowledge. Considerable
variation is possible within each treatment train in the selec-tion of speci ﬁc technologies.
1.4.1 T ERTIARY TREATMENT
In municipal wastewater treatment, additional unit processesmay include any or all of the following: ﬁltration to reduce
particles, precipitation by lime to reduce phosphates, and
adsorption with activated carbon to reduce organic molecules.
If the goal is to produce potable water, then hyper- ﬁltration
(reverse osmosis) may be added along with several other unitprocesses.
1.4.1.1 Cases
Usually tertiary treatment situations have involved small
ﬂows, e.g., 0.044 m
3=s (1.0 mgd). In some cases, such as in
providing water for irrigation, sand ﬁltration without coagu-
lants has been used. The Parkson Dynasand moving bed ﬁlter
has been used in a number of such instances as has the ABW
traveling bridge ﬁlter of In ﬁlco-Dregemont. These are ‘‘pack-
age ’’-type technologies that can be added to any conventional
treatment train. These cases illustrate the systems context of
most water treatment projects and the role of political factors.Both are inherent in any public project.
1.4.1.1.1 Aspen
TheCityofAspen,Colorado,installed anABW traveling bridge
ﬁlter, developed for water treatment, to treat ef ﬂuent from its
conventional wastewater treatment train. The ef ﬂuent discharge
permit for discharge to the Roaring Fork River required a‘‘20=20’’standard (20 mg =L suspended solids =20 mg=L bio-chemical oxygen demand). The river has high value as a ﬁshery
and for recreational use, and the ﬁlters provide a margin
of safety.
1.4.1.1.2 Ignacio
Figure 1.3a is a photograph of an ABW system as
used for drinking water treatment at Ignacio, Colorado. Figure1.3b is a cutaway perspective of the ABW system. The basicsystem is the same for water or wastewater, albeit the mediamay be different from one use to another. The traditional mediais sand with a depth of 305 mm (12 in.). A ‘‘cell ’’is 203 mm
(8 in.) wide and its length is across the bed of the ﬁlter.

and moves continuously from one end of the ﬁlter bed to
the other and back again. The ﬂow through each cell declines
as the media clogs and is restored to the clean-bed level
after backwash.
1.4.1.1.3 Colorado Springs
Because of a drought during the period 1955 –1959, the City
of Colorado Springs (Colorado Springs, c. 1972) has had
tertiary treatment following traditional treatment since 1960.This initial treatment was ﬁltration only and the water was
used for golf course and park irrigation, and was later calledthe ‘‘irrigation circuit’’ ; the treatment capacity was Q¼0.394
m
3=s (9.0 mgd). In 1970, a second treatment train was added
and was called an ‘‘industrial circuit, ’’with capacity 0.0876
m3=s (2.0 mgd). The ef ﬂuent was used for cooling tower water
at a municipal power plant with the cost of treatment about$0.07=m
3or $260 =mg.
1.4.1.1.3.1 Irrigation Circuit The irrigation circuit had
four 3.658 m (12 ft) diameter dual media pressure ﬁlters with
ﬁltration velocity 36.7 m =h (15 gpm =ft2). The media was
0.91 m (3 ft) of 1.5 mm sand on the bottom with 1.52 m (5 ft)of 2.8 mm anthracite on top.
1.4.1.1.3.2 Industrial Circuit The treatment train for the
industrial circuit was coagulation and settling by means of a
‘‘solids-contact ’’clariﬁer, re-carbonation with carbon dioxide,
ﬁltration with anthracite and sand, and carbon adsorption. Thesolids-contact unit, 14.63 m (48 ft) diameter, used a lime doseof 300 –350 mg =L of CaO, which raised the pH to 11.5.
Following the solids contact unit, the pH was lowered to 7.0by carbon dioxide (from furnace gas used for carbon regen-eration) supplemented by sulfuric acid. Filtration using coarsemedia was the next step in order to provide redundancy insolids removal in the event of upset of the solids-contact
clariﬁer. Carbon adsorption by GAC was the next step,
which used two columns in series (Figure 1.4). Each column
was 6.096 m (20 ft) diameter and 4.267 m (14 ft) high, packedwith 3.048 m (10 ft) of 8 /C230 mesh GAC with mass
41,864 kg (94,000 lb). For the design ﬂow of 0.0876 m
3=s
(2.0 mgd), the hydraulic loading rate was 10.39 m =h
(4.25 gpm =ft2). Removal of COD was 0.50 –0.60 kg COD =kg
carbon (0.50 –0.60 lb COD =lb carbon). The carbon columns
were backwashed daily.
1.4.1.1.4 Denver Reuse Demonstration Plant
The Denver Reuse Demonstration Plant, Q¼0.044 m3=s
(1.0 mgd), was in operation in the period 1985 –1991. The
source water was efﬂ uent from the nearby Denver Metro
WWTP (called Denver Metro Water Reclamation Plant).
The ‘‘reuse plant ’’treated water that exceeded standards for
potable water.
The plant cost was $20 million with about $10 million for
studies to determine health risks. The treatment train includedlime precipitation, ﬁltration, ion exchange, adsorption with
activated carbon, ozone oxidation =disinfection, hyper- ﬁltra-
tion, and chlorination. Side streams investigated differentdisinfectants, various membranes such as micro- ﬁltration
and ultra ﬁltration, and ozonation prior to adsorption. Figure
1.5 shows the overall plant schematic (for the ‘‘health-effects ’’
treatment train) and three photographs that illustrate the sub-stantial size of the plant.
The plant was ‘‘demonstration ’’size, and was intended to
demonstrate the feasibility of direct potable reuse. While thepurpose of a pilot plant is to develop design guidelines for afull-scale plant, a demonstration plant is much larger in sizeand may have several purposes, both technical and political.
The former relate to such issues as long-term health effects due
to trace amounts of organics, the cost of operation, the man-power required, reliability, and the assessment of unforeseenissues (such as the durability of the lining of the carbon col-umns). This does not mean that process issues are ignored, butonly that the emphasis shifts (as opposed to a pilot plant) toquestions that require experience at a full-scale level of oper-ation. The political aspects are equally important. The reuse
plant had an attractive, architect-designed, exterior appearance
with equally pleasing interior. A water fountain of its productwater was located in the lobby, and the plant hosted innumer-able tours and published many papers and had high visibilityfrom local to international levels. The program to implementpotable water reuse had included the issues of public accept-ance, and con ﬁdence and need for political support.
1.4.2 I NDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Regarding industrial wastewater treatment, the treatment tech-nologies are usually the minimum required to meet the regu-latory requirements in force. This may range from settling to
FIGURE 1.4 GAC columns for tertiary treatment at Colorado
Springs, c. 1972.10 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and Biologicalremove soil sediments and land treatment to remove organic
molecules for sugar beets, to settling and anaerobic pondsfor meat packing, to precipitation of heavy metals for theelectronics industry and metals industry. Many industries,
depending on policies and plant management, take pride in
exceeding legal requirements.
1.4.2.1 Cases
Two cases are reviewed to indicate the variety of circumstan-
ces that in ﬂuence the selection of unit processes that comprise
treatment trains for industries. The circumstances of industriesare highly variable, and so there is a wide variation in treat-ment processes.
1.4.2.1.1 Coors Brewery
The Miller-Coors Brewery, formerly Coors Brewery until mer-
ger in 2008, in Golden, Colorado, utilizes biological treatment,Figure 1.6, and had a 30 =30 (BOD =TSS) ef ﬂuent discharge

FIGURE 1.6 Wastewater treatment at Miller-Coors Brewery, Golden,
Colorado. Pure-oxygen-activated sludge reactors are in background and
underground. (Courtesy of Miller-Coors Brewery, Golden, CO.)Water Treatment 11Platte River about 16 km (10 mi) downstream. The ﬁrst plant
was built in 1954, i.e., 18 years prior to being required by
federal =state regulations. In 1981 a new plant, dedicated to
the Coors Brewery industrial wastes (i.e., malting, brewing,and packaging) was put on line. (The 1954 plant then servedonly the City of Golden, along with sanitary wastes from otherindustrial operations and industrial wastes from the can manu-facturing and ceramics facilities.) The new wastewater treat-ment system (i.e., the 1981 plant) included a coarse screen and
grit removal (the latter to remove barley and other grain par-
ticles), an equalization basin to mitigate the effects of batchdischarges, primary settling, activated sludge treatment usingpure oxygen, and secondary settling. The plant was designedwith the ﬁltration of secondary settling ef ﬂuent, using Parkson
Dynasand ﬁlters with discharge to Clear Creek. In the years
since 1981, the plant has been modi ﬁed to more effectively and
more economically achieve its objectives.
In 2001, an anaerobic pretreatment plant was built at site of
the 1981 WWTP; the anaerobic plant receives about 60% ofthe organic loading from the brewery and removes about65%–85% of the soluble organics, depending upon the
hydraulic detention time. (The anaerobic process is sometimesused for high-strength industrial wastes as a means to reduce theloading to an aerobic biological treatment system. In the case ofCoors, the BOD varies but about 1800 mg =L may be considered
representative.) The Parkson Dynasand ﬁlters were taken out
of operation in 1999 due to maintenance dif ﬁculties caused by
adhesion of a cationic polymer to the ﬁlter media. The polymer
was used in secondary settling, and in the evaluation of thetrade-offs was selected in preference to the tertiary ﬁltration.
The ef ﬂuents from the two plants are co-mingled and a single
discharge permit then serves both plants.
Some notes on the Coors operation —technical, manage-
ment, and political —may help to understand better the ﬁeld of
industrial wastewaters:
.First, equalization basins are common to industriessubject to batch discharges. The basins are aerated tomaintain aerobic conditions and to minimize thedeposition of solids. Equalization basins have beenadvocated for municipal treatment but they have not
become assimilated into practice.
.Second, the pure oxygen provides a higher reaction
rate and thus smaller aeration basins (i.e., a smaller‘‘footprint, ’’important in the Coors case).
.Third, the ﬁltration process was used originally at
Coors to provide a buffer to ensure compliance withthe 30=30 permit.
.Fourth, the Miller-Coors Brewery is highly visible
because of its size and because of its historical prom-
inence in Colorado. Any noncompliance with envir-onmental standards, particularly on Clear Creek thatreceives the discharge from Coors, is noted quicklyby the news media. The selection of processes andtechnologies for the treatment train re ﬂects these
political factors, i.e., to ensure compliance at a highprobability level..Fifth, the management philosophy is the most import-
ant facet of how an industry deals with its environ-
mental issues. Coors (now Miller-Coors) has had ahistory of identifying potential issues ahead of thepublic perception, political movements, and legalmandates, and dealing with them as matters of goodbusiness and good citizenship (some call this being‘‘proactive ’’), which has been the position of many
industries, as opposed a perception by some that they
all are ‘‘foot-dragging.’’
.Sixth, as a rule, industries want to know the rules and
to know that the rules are enforced fairly upon theircompetitors as well, and to have con ﬁdence that there
will not be vacillation (i.e., that the rules do not varyfrom year-to-year as political administrationschange).
1.4.2.1.2 Anheuser-Busch Brewery
The Anheuser-Busch Brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, was
put on line about 1986. The brewery is located about 16 km(10 mi) northeast of the City, adjacent to Interstate 25 and inan area that is largely irrigated agriculture. Prior to coming toFort Collins, an agreement was developed with the City ofFort Collins to utilize its south WWTP, constructed in 1968and largely mothballed in 1976 after construction of a new
plant on the same site, i.e., the North Plant (further modi ﬁed
in 1993). The South Plant was renovated in 1986 to accom-
modate the brewery wastes and was comprised of primarysettling, activated sludge, and secondary settling. A bar screenwas located at the plant site. As an alternative to the FortCollins South Plant, the brewery can discharge to a landtreatment site. The site is located about 8 km (5 mi) east ofthe plant. The site has storage and is set up to spray irrigate the
wastewater on the land. The spray irrigation rate does not
exceed the in ﬁltration rate of the soil. The system is utilized
irrespective of crop growth cycles but is suspended during coldmonths when freezing may be a problem.
1.4.3 I NDUSTRIAL PROCESS WATERTREATMENT
Industrial water treatment for process water is another signi ﬁ-
cant area. The variation may include industries that can usepotable water directly without further treatment, such as forfood products, with perhaps dechlorination. The electricenergy industry requires mineral-free water for boiler feed,while the electronics industry requires essentially molecularwater. The unit processes in each case may require many ofthose listed in Table 1.1 (and in Tables 1.2a and b).
1.4.4 H AZARDOUS WASTES
Contaminated groundwater is a common context for hazard-ous wastes. In some instances, the remedial action is topump the aquifer and pass the ﬂow through a treatment
plant, which is called a ‘‘pump-and-treat ’’situation. Organic
chemicals are common contaminants and there are thousandsof possibilities. Adsorption by GAC is a common unit12 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and Biologicalprocess =technology. Other situations, such as at mine drain-
age site, may include heavy metals in which case precipitation
is a likely unit process. In some cases, hyper- ﬁltration is
added, mainly for redundancy.
1.4.5 H AZARDOUS WASTES:INSITUTREATMENT
In some cases, in situ treatment is applied. A main technicalproblem is to get the reactants in contact with one another,i.e., how to ‘‘transport ’’one reactant on the surface to another
that is ‘‘in situ ’’is the issue. This may involve an elaborate
scheme, in which the ‘‘transport ’’is by convection and diffu-
sion. An example is the practice of punching the groundsurface with a grid of holes used to pump water with a‘‘reactant ’’to the site of adsorbed (on soil) or dissolved (in
pore water) contaminants. The ‘‘reactant ’’may be a bacterial
species (perhaps genetically modi ﬁed), chemicals, air, steam,
etc. The point is that the ‘‘reactor ’’is the in situ site of the
contaminant; actually, it is one of numerous micro-reactors.
1.5 DESIGN
A variety of nontechnical issues are a part of any design. Someare addressed in this section. The technical design itself is notjust a computational algorithm, but involves mostly assump-tions, judgments, and decisions. An engineering backgroundgives the technical basis for decision-making, e.g., what maybe feasible, and a context for continued learning.
1.5.1 F ACTORS :NONTECHNICAL
The end product of the design process is a physical plant. Theplant design is designed by a consulting engineering ﬁrm with
qualiﬁed staff. The ﬁrm selected is usually one of several who
may have competed for the contract. Based upon the design, acontractor is selected, with the engineer acting as the owner ’s
agent (the traditional arrangement). Getting to the point of acompleted design involves a host of issues that may involvepolitics, dealing with neighbors, ﬁnancing, owner ’s ideas,
operation, esthetics, environmental considerations, waterrights, etc. The consulting engineer manages these factorsbased upon experience and exercise of judgment, as opposed
to academic studies.
1.5.1.1 Operation Issues
Design involves a stream of decisions involving ‘‘trade-offs ’’
between capital cost and operation. Operation factors may
include costs, such as energy and maintenance, the ease of
operation, environmental impacts, etc. In addition to such
factors, operators nearly always have views that may beimportant in the design. Some examples include adding agullet with drain in a pipe gallery for easy hose-down andcleaning; using aluminum hand rails so that painting is notrequired; venting enclosed spaces and rooms that may behandling chemicals; dehumidifying a pipe gallery; providingattractive lunchrooms and locker rooms with showers; takinginto account noise problems associated with pumps; design-
ing rooms with windows; placing signs to accommodate
visitors and public tours, a reception area, etc.
1.5.1.2 Managing a Team
In addition to the management of staff, the engineer assumes
thede facto leadership and management of an informal team
that may include the owner and perhaps a representative from
the political body, operators, regulatory authorities, equip-
ment manufacturer ’s representatives, the suppliers of mater-
ials required in operation, the contractor, the architect, alandscape architect, a water rights expert, a limnologist, secur-ity advisor, accountant, ﬁnancing expert, etc. Those in the
team involved depend upon the size of project and its context.As a rule, these ideas are learned by the engineer ‘‘on-the-
job. ’’Academic courses tend to focus on technical factors,
albeit there are exceptions (see, e.g., Qasim et al., 2006).Excerpts from an article by Lagnese (2000), a former presi-dent of the Water Environment Federation (1968 –1969), and
of the American Academy of Environmental Engineers(1991), who taught a practical design course at the Universityof North Carolina, provide a ﬁrsthand design perspective.
Notes from Joseph F. Lagnese, Jr.
Design is an arduous, iterative process. Ideas are advanced
based upon limited factors and intuition and then evaluated.
The initial ideas are then reﬁ ned and =or eliminated, new ideas
proposed, and the process repeated as often as necessary to
ultimate completion. Stated in another way, design is inher-
ently a ‘‘two steps forward, one step backward ’’process. . . .
the ultimate products of design are the plans and speci ﬁca-
tions required to guide the construction of a total facility that isefﬁcient in operating needs and performance capability.
Whereas process design theory and fundamentals requiremathematical and science capabilities, the other aspects of
design rely upon creative and organizational talents and
team-play ability, as well as aptitudes in such diverse areasas economics and aesthetics. Design is a knowledge intensive
process which requires not only an understanding of many
diverse fundamental concepts, but also such practicums asengineering pricing, selection of process equipment
and construction materials, architecture, construction tech-
niques and procedures, operational requirements, ergonomics,satisfying relevant regulatory controls, and project ﬁnancing.
As such, design is an optimization process dependent on theappropriate consideration of a broad range of impacting fac-tors. There are few absolutes; most completed designs repre-sent imperfect solutions.
1.5.1.3 Expansion
The provision for expansion may be done by sizing pipes and
the procurement of land for a projected ultimate build-out.Not to plan ahead may result in several largely independentplants on one site, each with its own idiosyncrasies of oper-ation, not to mention inordinately higher costs.
1.5.1.4 Esthetics
Esthetic issues are as important as the functional design, and are
often overlooked. Does the plant enhance its sight? Does it ﬁtt h eWater Treatment 13sight architecturally? Was a landscape architect involved? Are
persons working at the plant motivated when they enter the
premises? Do the mayor and council view the plant withpride? Are peers pointing to the plant as a showcase for theindustry? Esthetic appeal is sometimes discounted by designersand owners. Community pride is nearly always associated withpublic facilities, not to speak of operator morale.
1.5.1.5 Regulations
There are two aspects to regulations: (1) those that specify
efﬂuent requirements, and (2) those that specify design. Com-
pliance with the former is essential. Variance is provided forthe latter subject to reasonable rationale or pilot plant results.Design guidelines by state regulatory agencies are sometimescontroversial. At the time such guidelines were instituted,
which go back to the 1930s and possibly earlier, the art of
plant design was not very far along. At that time, most of theexpertise regarding design resided among the engineeringstaff of the state health departments (Ongerth, 1999). Aseducational institutions developed a cadre of professionals intheﬁeld, however, the design capabilities expanded among
those in consulting engineering.
1.5.1.6 Institutions
An ‘‘institution ’’is deﬁned here as a ‘‘device of society to
manage itself ’’(my interpretation of the term based upon fre-
quent use by a sociologist colleague). Among the institutions in
environmental engineering one might include: laws and regula-tions, the traditions of excellence, practice and lore, education,training, certi ﬁcations, the licenses to practice, manufacturers,
research, government laboratories, the awarding of degrees,construction companies, consulting engineering ﬁrms, etc. The
respective purposes of these institutions are primarily technical,
but they function in a social context.
1.5.1.7 Consulting Engineering
Consulting engineers design systems that provide water sup-
ply, treat drinking water, industrial wastes, and municipalwastewaters, and assess the impacts of discharges on receiv-ing water. Any task that contributes to a solution to an envir-onmental problem is within the purview of practice.Consulting engineering has long been regarded as the citadelof technical expertise, ethics, and professionalism. Many con-
sulting engineering ﬁrms and engineers within various ﬁrms
have had careers that match this description.
To give a sense of the nature of consulting engineering
and the practitioners, Box 1.2 provides a glimpse through the
70-year career of Harvey F. Ludwig. Box 1.3 describes someof the changes in the character of consulting engineeringpractice that has evolved since about 1980, i.e., as interpretedby the author. Box 1.4 adds commentary about a ‘‘golden ’’
age of environmental engineering that coincided largely withthe environmental movement, also as interpreted by theauthor. These are not the only views of these three areas andare likely to induce alternative or complementary perspectivesfrom others.BOX 1.2 HARVEY F. LUDWIG
ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER CONSULTANT
On May 29, 1965, Harvey F. Ludwig (b. 1916) was
awarded a doctorate by Clemson University. The cit-
ation read, in part,
engineer, teacher, public servant and world-renown
authority on environmental and sanitary engineering,
his advancement of the engineering profession in the
ﬁeld of environmental health, his scholarly research,
and his outstanding leadership in scienti ﬁc affairs on a
national and international basis.
Harvey F. Ludwig, c. 1968
The citation was at year 27 of what has become a 70-
year career of continuing contributions and leadershipthat has helped shape the modern practice of environ-mental engineering. Dr. Ludwig obtained his BS degreein 1938 in civil and sanitary engineering from the
University of California, with MS in 1941. During
World War II Dr. Ludwig was a commissioned of ﬁcer
of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS). In 1946, hestarted a consulting practice and in 1949 became anassociate professor at the University of California. In1951, he became Assistant Chief Engineer, USPHS(under Dr. Mark Hollis). In this position, he presidedover the development of the institutions (i.e., laws,
federal agencies, programs) that were the foundations
for what emerged in ﬁnal form in the 1970s (and have
continued to evolve). At the same time, Dr. Ludwigoversaw research funding at various universities acrossthe United States that fueled research and graduateprograms that led to a ‘‘ﬂowering ’’of the ﬁeld that
has continued. In 1956, Dr. Ludwig resigned from theUSPHS and started Engineering-Science (ES). His
modus operandi was to hire mostly MS and PhD stu-
dents recruited from his network of academic col-
leagues who would adapt their research knowledgeinto practice. At that time, hiring engineers with gradu-ate degrees was more unusual than common.14 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and BiologicalBOX 1.3 GLOBALIZATION OF THE WATER
INDUSTRY AND CONSULTING ENGINEERING
In 1974, the water industry in England and Wales was
reorganized with 10 regional water authorities withjurisdiction over all water functions, e.g., water supply,wastewater, ﬂood control, and river management. The
regional authorities had taken over from some 1600
separate local authorities (Okun, pv, 1977). In 1988,
due to a change in political climate, let by the thenPrime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, the water industryin England and Wales was again ‘‘privatized, ’’with the
10 water authorities remaining. The change had a globalsigniﬁcance. Using Thames Water as an example,
which was one of the 10 regional water authorities,the organization was freed from the limitations of
being a public entity. Over the years following privat-
ization, Thames Water purchased major companies inthe water industry and sold its services worldwide inconsulting engineering, management, construction, andoperation (see http: = =www.thameswater.co.uk). They
joined Vivendi Universal of France in providing ‘‘one-
stop shopping ’’for water services. Vivendi Universal
was formerly Compagnie Generale des Eaux created in
1853 by imperial decree to provide water to Lyons. The
company expanded and diversiﬁed from 1980 to 1996,

ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER CONSULTANT
ES expanded rapidly with of ﬁces at key cities in the
United States including a research laboratory and of ﬁce
in Oakland (c. 1956), and later in Washington, Districtof Columbia (c. 1966) headed by his long-time USPHSassociate, Gordon MacCallum, and then in Austin,Texas, started by Dr. Davis Ford (c. 1968). The ﬁrm
grew rapidly with important projects throughout theUnited States and started to develop an internationalclientele. Dr. Ludwig was at this time, in 1969, a‘‘legend ’’in the ﬁeld. At the same time, the ﬁeld was
experiencing a ‘‘golden age, ’’i.e., research was advan-
cing knowledge, graduate programs were spreading,practice was ﬂourishing, and the public had adopted a
widespread environmental ethos that was being trans-
lated by politicians into laws and policy. At that time,
ES was arguably at the crest of this movement, i.e., oneof the most visible of ﬁrms in the ﬁeld and at the
forefront of innovation. This was due not only toDr. Ludwig individually, but to the way he had struc-tured the ﬁrm with both depth and breadth of expertise
and leadership. In addition, Dr. Ludwig had extensiveinvolvement with professors from throughout the
United States.
ES was actually, however, a part of a larger corporate
structure. One entity was a construction company that had
ﬁnancial dif ﬁculty (due to a low bid on a dam). The
‘‘way-out ’’was a buyout offer in 1968 by Zurn Industries
of Erie, Pennsylvania. The new corporate structure didnot work out, and Dr. Ludwig left the ﬁrm in 1972, setting
up his own practice in Washington, District of Columbia
(Ludwig 1985). ES was later purchased by its employees
and remained prominent in the ﬁeld through 2004 when
its identity was assimilated fully by Parsons, an inter-national construction company.
In 1973, Dr. Ludwig ’s private practice led to Bang-
kok where he started a new ﬁrm, Seatec International,
which has in ﬂuenced environmental engineering
throughout South-East Asia. While there, he has cham-
pioned the case for adapting environmental standards
and designs to match the socioeconomic context ofdeveloping countries, i.e., as contrasted to imposingthe design approaches of industrialized countries. Asof 2008, Dr. Ludwig had some 358 publications rangingfrom research on coagulation, c. 1941, to strategies forsaving the forests in South-East Asia, c. 2005. Four ofhis papers won awards from organizations such as
ASCE, AWWA, WEF. Personal achievement awards
have included election to the National Academy ofEngineering, in 1969, shortly after its founding; theAEESP Founder ’s Award; the AAEE Honorary Mem-
ber award; the 1999 University of California College ofEngineering Alumnus of the Year; and various awardsin Bangkok.As to the persona, Dr. Ludwig has been a mentor to
countless engineers in practice. He is known by hishigh standards in writing, in professional practice, andin getting a job done. To quote Professor DonaldAnderson, c. 1965, when he headed the Oakland of ﬁce
of ES, ‘‘When you work for Harvey Ludwig, . . . ,’’
meaning that much was expected. He was instrumentalin founding what is now the American Academy of
Environmental Engineers (a certifying organization),
c. 1956, and sponsored the founding of the Associationof Environmental Engineering and Science Professors(AEESP), c. 1963. In 1966, his ﬁrm ES initiated the
sponsoring of a ‘‘best thesis ’’cash award within
AEESP; his rationale was that the signi ﬁcant cash
($1000 at that time) added prestige to the award. Theaward has continued under auspices of other ﬁrms with
inclusion of both master ’s and doctoral theses.
Dr. Ludwig is known for expressing his candid opin-
ion (on virtually any topic). Consequently, he has bothmany admirers and a few detractors. He continues anactive correspondence, by e-mail, with perhaps a circleof some 20 –100 family members, friends, and col-
leagues. From Bangkok, Dr. Ludwig remains a pres-ence in the ﬁeld of environmental engineering.Water Treatment 15BOX 1.4 GOLDEN AGE OF
ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
Almost every ﬁeld has a ‘‘golden age, ’’perhaps charac-
terized by the nostalgia of those who reminisce. In
October 1957, the then Soviet Union launched into orbitthe earth satellite Sputnik . This event electri ﬁed the world
and shocked the United States in almost every respect.
One could easily view Sputnik moving across the skies
relative to the ﬁeld of stars as tangible evidence that the
United States was not so advanced as presumed; the view
evoked deep emotions. The upshot was introspectivequestioning of the adequacy of U.S. education, science,mathematics, and engineering. The result was the unpre-cedented funding of these areas, perhaps epitomized bythe 1961 commitment of President Kennedy to ‘‘place a
man on the moon within this decade. ’’At the same time,
an environmental movement was in a period of gestation.In 1962, Rachael Carson ’sSilent Spring was publishedBOX 1.3 (continued) GLOBALIZATION OF
THE WATER INDUSTRY AND CONSULTING
ENGINEERING
becoming involved in music, publishing, TV and ﬁlms,
telecoms, environmental services, etc. The name waschanged in 1998 to Vivendi Universal. The environ-mental services include the divisions of water, waste,energy, and transportation, and were active in over 100countries. Water customers number about 110 million.The creation of Thames Water and the expansion ofCompagnie Generale portended fundamental change inthe character of consulting engineering. The ‘‘client ’’
became a ‘‘customer, ’’something not thinkable until
the 1980s.
In the United States, the way had been paved legally
for this ‘‘new age ’’institutional form, i.e., a multinational
conglomerate. In 1972, the U.S. Justice Departmentforced ASCE, under consent decree, to change its codeof ethics to permit bidding for services and to permitadvertising. The upshot was that during the 1980s, bid-
ding for design services became the norm for some
clients (not all joined this trend). To compete in thenew market place, some of the larger consulting engin-eering ﬁrms formed subsidiary companies to construct
and operate plants. The traditional engineer –client rela-
tionship was being replaced by ‘‘turnkey ’’projects based
on bidding. With this institutional metamorphosis, U.S.engineering ﬁrms were then poised to compete globally
with Thames Water and Compagnie Generale des Eaux.Professional practice was no longer protected by ethics,tradition, and law. Engineering services were not thesame; they were becoming a commodity.and set in motion the movement, which had continuingmomentum through the 1970s, and was more or lessdissipated by the 1980s, perhaps as the political climatewas changing; at the same time, the movement was gain-ing ground in other countries. A series of laws andpolicies grew out of the movement, however, alongwith public funding for research, education, and man-dates for cleaning up the environment and an associated
ﬂourishing of environmental engineering practice. Also,
during this period, i.e., in the early 1960s, doctorates
became a requisite for academics in engineering and thenumber of graduate programs expanded beyondthe ‘‘handful ’’that had existed up to about 1960. Funding
for research was appropriated by the U.S. Congress andthe chances for funding was higher in 1960s than in laterdecades. The result was a science-based understanding of
many of the unit processes that was translated toward a
more rational practice. Some of the processes that weredelineated in scienti ﬁc terms included the concept of an
activated-sludge basin as a ‘‘reactor, ’’and the associated
materials-balance depiction; reaction rates described interms of ‘‘kinetics ’’; the adoption of the Michaelis –
Menten description of bacterial kinetics; the assimilationof biochemistry in understanding biological reactions and
the role of ATP as well as DNA; the assimilation of
turbulence theory in understanding coagulation and ﬂoc-
culation; the introduction of chemical equilibrium theoryand its application as a basis for understanding processes,e.g., in coagulation, redox reactions, precipitation, acid –
base reactions, ion exchange, etc.; the assimilation ofphysical chemistry as a basis for understanding the roleof temperature on reaction rate, the mechanisms of
molecular adsorption on activated carbon, the laws for
gas transfer, the role of osmotic pressure in membranedesalination, etc.; anaerobic reactions became understoodin terms useful for practice. In addition, the ‘‘Advanced
Waste Treatment Research ’’program was initiated in
1962 by the Division of Water Supply and PollutionControl, USPHS, which included processes such asadsorption, electrodialysis, distillation, reverse osmosis,
ion exchange, etc., with funding for both in-house and
extramural projects. The program also contributed to thechanging paradigm of the ﬁeld, i.e., from empiricism to
science.
The research during the 1960s was, to a large extent,
‘‘unsolicited, ’’meaning that a professor could propose
the topic and the approach; the ‘‘peer-review ’’scrutiny
was the basis for quality control. This contrasted with
the approach after 1972 when EPA was formed and
research funding had to ‘‘support regulations. ’’The
research objectives were formulated by persons withina given agency, which greatly limited continued pro-gress in applying fundamental knowledge to applica-tions. The National Science Foundation, however,remained a traditional unsolicited research organization,16 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and Biological1.6 SUMMARY
As indicated, water treatment covers a great deal of variety.
With about 15 unit processes, the combination selected for atreatment train depends on the technical requirements of thetreatment task, i.e., the contaminants to be treated and theobjectives of the treatment.
For any unit process, a number of technologies exist or
may be developed that utilize the principles of the process.
Some are generic and some are proprietary. The technologies
provide an array of choices that help to tailor a treatment trainto the situation at hand.
The intent of the book is to describe theory and practice for
each of the unit processes. The speci ﬁc technologies are
described only as useful to illustrate the processes. The tech-nologies represent the variations of principles associated witha particular unit process.
Nontechnical issues play a part in almost every technical
decision and are alluded to in order to indicate some ofthe realities of process design. These factors are learned mostlyin the context of experience and are mentioned in this book onlyto a limited extent so that there is an awareness of their role.

but with not too much funding available in environmen-
tal engineering. Some topics remained without ‘‘clos-
ure ’’and the rate of advance to the ﬁeld was slowed and
dependent, to a large extent, on what could be gleaned
from projects that suited the agencies, particularly EPA.Although the ‘‘golden age ’’has passed, the profession
has made the transition from purely empiricism torational approaches. Some may argue that the pendulumhas swung too far, i.e., that we may lack a sense of
serving professional practice as the primary guide in
engineering education and perhaps even in consultingengineering.Water Treatment 17Describe how you would respond with respect to treat-

GLOSSARY
Active process: A process that is controlled by actions of the
operator.
Box ( n.):A short, often boxed auxiliary story that is printed
alongside a longer article and that typically presentsadditional, contrasting, or supplemental views.
Constant: A ratio of two or more variables that is char-
acteristic of a group of materials or a system.Examples of the former include the universal gasconstant for gases, and the modulus of elasticity forsolid materials. Often, a coef ﬁcient is called a con-
stant.
Discipline: A family-like grouping of individuals sharing
intellectual ancestry and united at any given timeby an interest in common or overlapping problems,
techniques, and institutions . . . Some are happy fam-
ilies, with little controversy over methods and goals.Others are fractured into many research schools,each with a different agenda, each evolving its owntraditions of thought and work, and each competingfor resources and recognition . . . . Disciplines notonly lend structure and meaning to lives, they alsobring order and signi ﬁcance to knowledge. (Excerpts
from the Preface of Servos, 1990.)
Engineered process: A unit process that has been designed
by an engineer (as opposed to a natural process).
Natural process: An in ﬂuence within the ambient environ-
ment that causes changes in water quality. Examplesinclude dilution due to mixing of streams, dispersionwithin a stream, heat transfer involving ambientwater, microbiological reactions within an ambient
water body, etc.
Passive process: A process that occurs largely without oper-
ator intervention. Slow sand ﬁltration or trickling
ﬁlter treatment are examples. All natural unit pro-
cesses are passive.
Process: An in ﬂuence that causes change, i.e., a ‘‘state ’’
change. As applied to water quality, a process causes
change in one or more water-quality characteristics.
Science: Systematized knowledge obtained from observation,
study, and experiment in order to determine thenature of that studied. George A. Olah, 1994 Chem-istry Nobelist at ACS Symposium as reported inChemical & Engineering News , Vol. 76(35):6, 31
August 1998.18 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and BiologicalState of water: The quality characteristics of a given water
volume, including concentrations of mineral sus-
pended matter, ions, molecules, microorganisms,and such parameters as temperature, pH, speci ﬁc
electrical conductance, etc.
Technology: (1) An anthropogenic device contrived to
accomplish a task. The rapid ﬁltration process is
encompassed within the ﬁltration technology,
which includes all of the appurtenances to make it
function to remove suspended particles to a speci ﬁed
concentration level. (2) A collection of devices con-
trived to accomplish one or more tasks, as in asystem. Water treatment technology includes all ofthe processes and relevant appurtenances to producepotable water.
Technology: A technology is a means to implement a unit
process. Any number of technology forms may be
devised to embody a unit process. For example, a
bioﬁlm reactor may be embodied in several forms,
including a traditional trickling ﬁlter, a deep-bed
trickling ﬁlter, a rotating disk reactor, a traditional
slow sand ﬁlter, a bio- ﬁlter for removal of natural
organic matter (NOM), etc.
Treatment: Subjecting water to the unit processes of a treat-
ment train.
Treatment train: An aggregation of unit processes.
Unit operation: A term used in chemical engineering to
designate a physical change, e.g., pumping, screen-ing, sedimentation, ﬁltration, etc. The term is not
used in this book in favor of using a single term,‘‘unit process. ’’
Unit process (chemical engineering): A term used in
chemical engineering to designate a chemical
change, e.g., oxidation, precipitation, disinfection,
and biological treatment. The chemical engineeringliterature is not unequivocal in the use of the twoterms ‘‘unit operation ’’and ‘‘unit process, ’’but the
deﬁnitions given seem to capture the sense of
how they are used.
Unit process (this book): As used in this book, the term
‘‘unit process ’’means an engineered effect that
causes a ‘‘state change. ’’The sense is the same as in
chemical engineering except that a ‘‘state change ’’is
much broader that being restricted to a ‘‘chemical
change. ’’A state change may include not only chem-
ical change, but pressure change, temperature change,concentration change, etc. Thus, settling (change inconcentration of particles) is a process by this de ﬁn-
ition as is even pumping (which causes a pressurechange).

Contaminants in water encompass a wide variety of sub-
stances. A sampling might include inorganic ions, organicmolecules, chemical complexes, mineral particles, microor-ganisms, and even heat. Larger kinds of contaminants mayinclude oil and scum, natural debris, ﬁsh, boards, rags, and
whatever may be discarded to the sewer or to ambient waters.
Contaminants can number, literally, in the millions. Those
that are regulated in the United States number about 4000.
Typical source waters for various purposes include moun-
tain streams, lower reaches of rivers, municipal wastewater,treated municipal wastewater, hazardous waste sites, etc. Eachhas a typical ‘‘proﬁle ’’of water quality, and some kind of
treatment is always required prior to use in order to meet thecriteria or standards of that use. Then, after a use of water, and
prior to discharge to rivers, lakes, and seas, the product water
must meet the standards and =or criteria established for such
discharge. The treatment train selected depends upon theparticular combination of source water available and productwater required. The source water quality available and prod-uct water quality required, along with cultural, economic, andoperation factors, is the treatment ‘‘context. ’’Thousands of
such combinations are possible, making each treatment con-
text unique.
2.1 WATER QUALITY: DEFINITIONS
The term water quality has to do with the description of
given water in terms of its characteristics. Characteristics of
water quality include temperature; concentrations of various
kinds of particles; concentrations of dissolved materials; and
parameters such as turbidity, pH, color, conductivity, etc.
The term characteristic is more inclusive than the term
contaminant and would include temperature, color, turbid-
ity, conductivity, etc. Two of these categories of character-istics, i.e., particles and dissolved materials, would includethousands of species each. A particular combination, or set,
of characteristics would comprise a water quality proﬁ le.
Those contaminants that interfere with a particular use may
be considered pollutants.
To add further to the de ﬁnitions that circle about the same
idea, the term parameter is used frequently. Water quality
parameters might include temperature, BOD, pH, speci ﬁc
electrical conductance, UV
254absorbance, etc.
With respect to uses of water, the terms criterion andstand-
ardare important. A water quality criterion is a contaminant
concentration limit that, if exceeded, may impair a use or
cause a toxic effect in certain animals or plants. As an example,
ab o r o n limit of 0.5 mg =L is considered appropriate for
citrus crops. A criterion could also specify a contaminant orparameter range , e.g., 3.3/C20pH/C2010.7 for trout (McKee and
Wolfe, 1963, p. 236). A water quality standard is a quasi-legal
limit for a contaminant concentration or parameter value, i.e.,the value may be referenced in a law but may be either ‘‘recom-
mended ’’or ‘‘enforced, ’’depending upon the severity of the
effects and the levels that are economically achievable. Usually,
there is nothing absolute about the foregoing de ﬁnitions.
Table 2.1 illustrates a water quality description for a pro-
posed industrial waste discharge. Points of interest in Table
2.1 are (1) some 37 contaminants are listed; (2) concentrationlimits are shown for each contaminant; (3) two places fordischarge —a publicly owned treatment works and a river —
are shown, each with its own respective discharge limits; (4)limits are given in terms of the monthly average and the daily
maximums; (5) a variety of organic compounds are listed; and
(6) a variety of heavy metals are listed. Each treatment situ-ation is different and would have a different list of contamin-ants and different limits. A similar tabular description, butwith different constituents, would apply to a municipal waste-water discharge, a drinking water treatment plant productwater, or another industrial waste situation.
2.1.1 C ONTAMINANTS
Acontaminant is deﬁned as a substance that makes another
substance impure. As applied to water, any material that is
present in the water other than molecular water would be a
contaminant. Often, the term has a negative connotation; inother words, we most often refer to an undesired substance asa contaminant. The term ’sconstituents and characteristics
have more neutral connotations and are used here almostinterchangeably with the word contaminant. As noted, how-ever, the term characteristic is more inclusive and would
include such things as temperature and turbidity.
Apollutant is a synonym of the word contaminant but is
more often identi ﬁed as an introduced contaminant from an
anthropogenic source. The de ﬁnition of a pollutant by the US
Public Health Service drinking water standards (USPHS,1962) was
Pollution, as used in these Standards, means the presence of
any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, radiological, orbiological) in water, which tends to degrade its quality so as
to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness of the water.
As used later by the regulations pursuant to PL92-500 —the
1972 Clean Water Act —the term pollutant is associated
with an introduced contaminant and implies impaired utility
of water.
212.1.2 S TATE OF WATER
Thestate of a volume of water, as de ﬁned here, refers to its
water quality. Characteristics of water quality that may com-
prise its ‘‘state ’’include temperature; concentrations of vari-
ous kinds of particles; concentrations of dissolved materials;
and parameters such as turbidity, pH, color, conductivity, etc.
The idea of ‘‘state ’’(deﬁned usually, in the ﬁeld of physical
chemistry, as pressure, temperature, volume) comes from theﬁeld of physical chemistry and is the same as a water quality‘‘proﬁle. ’’Both water quality ‘‘state ’’and water quality ‘‘pro-
ﬁle ’’are terms adopted for use in this text.
The term water quality ‘‘state ’’adds the notion that energy
is involved. For example, if we reduce the concentration of a
substance, as done by a unit process, a state change results and
energy is required.
2.1.3 C RITERIA
A water quality criterion refers to a contaminant level, which
when not exceeded, will not impair a given bene ﬁcial use of
water. A great deal of research and deliberation is involved inestablishing a criterion for a particular contaminant. Seldom isthe result de ﬁnitive, and considerable uncertainty may be
associated with any numerical value determined.
2.1.4 S TANDARDS
A criterion becomes the basis for a standard , which is a
codiﬁed criterion. Water quality standards have evolved
over the decades of the twentieth century. Usually, standardsarenormative in character, i.e., dependent not only on effects
on uses but on economic and cultural factors.
2.1.4.1 Kinds of Water Quality Standards
Water quality standards have been developed for a variety of
situations. The ﬁrst in the United States were in 1914 and
applied to drinking water on ‘‘common carriers ’’that crossed
interstate boundaries. These standards evolved, incrementally,to the USPHS Drinking Water Standards of 1962. They are
useful to review for the following reasons: (1) the standards
provide an overview of some of the notions of basic standardsfor drinking water quality; and (2) the 1962 standards were astarting point for those that have evolved pursuant to PL93-523,the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act, and its ensuing amendments.BOX 2.1 ON WATER QUALITY
In the 1880s, notions of water quality were limited bythe knowledge in the two of its science ‘‘mother ’’
ﬁelds—chemistry and bacteriology. Inorganic constitu-
ents were expressed as concentrations of various salts,e.g., calcium sulfate, sodium chloride, etc. Many yearswould elapse before inorganic chemical water qualitywould be expressed in terms of cations and anions, e.g.,as Ca
2þ,S O 42/C0, etc. The ion theory had not yet taken
hold, being proposed only in 1887 by Svente Arrhenius(1859 –1928), professor of chemistry, University of
Uppsala, but not accepted until years later. Regarding
microbes, the science of microbiology was just being
deﬁned, based upon the work of Pasteur in 1861, Lister
in 1867, and Koch in 1876 and 1882 (Prescott et al.,2005, p. 8). By about 1882, the science of bacteriologyhad an identity.
Courses in ‘‘sanitary chemistry ’’that evolved from
this background were focused largely on wet chemistryanalysis of such constituents as alkalinity, hardness,
nitrate, chloride, nitrogen, biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), etc. The Langelier Index, proposed by ProfessorWilfred Langelier in 1936 (see Langelier, 1936),brought some degree of rationale from equilibriumchemistry to the problems of deposition of calciumcarbonate and corrosion in pipes. The index was appliedempirically to handle problems of practice. Much aboutbacterial growth and enumeration of bacteria was
understood by the early twentieth century. Such was,
in-a-nutshell, the state of knowledge of water qualityabout 1950.
By the early1950s, the stage was being set for
t h em o d e r ne r a .T h eb o o kWater Quality Criteria(McKee, 1952) was published by the State of Cali-fornia, microbiology fundam entals were assimilated
in academic studies, and Werner Stumm at Harvard
introduced the idea of equilibrium chemistry as a
means to model the behavior of natural systems.By the late 1950s, instruments such as atomic absorp-tion, gas chromatography, polarography, ﬂuorescence,
TOC analyzers, mass spectrograph, etc. wereintroduced.
By the 1960s, ideas from chemistry theory, e.g.,
thermodynamics, kinetics, redox reactions, acid –base
reactions, complexation, etc., became assimilated intothe nomenclature of aqueous chemistry. Analyses ofwater could include a complete spectrum of organiccompounds along with the traditional ones. Totalorganic carbon (TOC) was a parameter used to supple-ment BOD but has yet to supplant the latter. Instrumen-tal methods were displacing wet chemistry andproviding the means to analyze for virtually any con-
taminant, and at microgram per liter levels.By the 1980s, the idea of water quality had moved
well beyond the traditional notions prevalent in the
1950s. Also, the spectrum of contaminants was verybroad and might well have included more than 100 ina typical analysis. Because of both perceived healthrisks and analytical capabilities that included more com-pounds and at lower levels, the number regulatedincreased to several thousand contaminants.22 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and BiologicalIn 1965, PL89-234 required that states develop standards
for interstate streams. In 1972, pursuant to PL92-500 —the
Clean Water Act —an efﬂuent discharge permit was required
and was called the National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. Drinking water standards were
required by PL93-523 —the Safe Drinking Water Act —which was the ﬁrst federal mandate for states to develop
drinking water standards. By 1986, some 83 contaminantswere regulated. Regulation of toxic pollutants was requiredunder the 1972 Clean Water Act (PL92-500), resulting in the
‘‘priority pollutant ’’list with some 129 contaminants (Keith
and Telliard, 1979). In addition, standards have evolved, orTABLE 2.1

bDirect discharge limitations.Water Contaminants 23have been contemplated, for a variety of other situations such
as for water reuse for agriculture, water reuse for drinking
water, etc.
2.1.4.2 Normative Standards
There is nothing absolute about water quality standards. Such
standards are determined both by the degree of perceived riskthat a society is willing to accept and by the knowledge ofparticular contaminants and their effects, i.e., criteria. It is the
norms of a society that determine which contaminants are of
concern and at what levels. Thus, water quality standards are
normative in nature.
2.1.4.3 Standards as Targets for Treatment
Water quality standards de ﬁne the performance requirements
for treatment plants. A problem is that such standards have
evolved and changed over the decades since their inception,
i.e., since the 1962 USPHS drinking water standards, consti-
tuting a ‘‘moving target, ’’so to speak. Planning a treatment
train should, then, build in the ﬂexibility to meet more strin-
gent standards in the future.
The overall ‘‘goal ’’in drinking water treatment has been,
since its inception, ‘‘to produce a safe, palatable water, ’’as
expressed by the American Water Works Association. Trad-itional objectives of treatment that support the health goal
have been to remove disease-causing organisms. Removal
of color, odor, and turbidity has supported the goal of apalatable water. The concern about chemicals that couldbe carcinogenic has led to additional objectives, ﬁrst to
remove trihalomethane precursors (expressed in the 1974Safe Drinking Water Act, i.e., PL93-523). This objectivewas expanded to include removal of disinfection by-products(DBPs). Subsequent to this, in later amendments, the SDWA
provided the mandate to remove an array of organic chemicals
and metals. Thus, while the goals have remained the same, theobjectives de ﬁned to achieve those goals have expanded to
accommodate increasing knowledge about contaminants,lower detection limits and increased accuracy in samplingand analysis, and more encompassing normative standards.
2.1.5 S URROGATES
Most measures of water quality involve surrogates, i.e., aquantity that is relatively easy to measure and may be usedas an index of the quantity of speci ﬁc interest. To illustrate,
two surrogates —turbidity and coliform bacteria —have been
institutionalized in their use. Regarding the latter, there aremany enteric pathogens, e.g., hepatitis A virus, ECHO 12virus, Coxsaki evirus, polio virus, Vibrio cholera bacterium,
Salmonella typhosi bacterium, Shigella dysenteriae bacterium,
Endamoeba histolytica ,Giardia lamblia cysts, Cryptosporid-
ium parvum oocysts, etc. By de ﬁnition, ‘‘enteric ’’means that
such organisms may be found in municipal sewage. Therefore,the coliform group of bacteria (more speci ﬁcally, the fecal
coliform subgroup) serves as a surrogate for enteric pathogensin general, and such presence would indicate the presence ofpathogens. Turbidity is a general indicator of water quality;a low level of turbidity does not ensure that the water is safe,
but a high level is grounds for rejection based on palatability
and on the presumption that the water is not safe.
One of the earliest surrogates in wastewater treatment was the
5 day BOD, i.e., BOD5 (or simply BOD, with the 5 day incu-bation period understood). The BOD is a measure of biodegrad-able organic matter. The difference between BOD

been a traditional measure of performance. Also, BOD is an
index of the impact on the oxygen resources of the ambientreceiving water. One factor in favor of adopting such a surrogateis that its use has been institutionalized (e.g., standards havebeen established, its laboratory protocol is well known, results ofmonitoring are available for most plants, its interpretation interms of plant performance or of water quality is clear).
Table 2.2 lists examples of surrogates used in water treat-
ment (both wastewater and potable water). Those that haveemerged since about 1980 include TOC, TTHMFP, UV
254,
MPA, and online particle counts. Some surrogates have ahistory, e.g., TOC became instrumentally feasible in 1965through instrumentation developed by Beckman Instruments,Inc., which converted organic carbon to carbon dioxide gas,which then was measured by infrared absorbance. A host ofother surrogates could be added. A laundry list, not inclusive,
might include TDS (total dissolved solids), EC (speci ﬁc
electrical conductivity), hardness as CaCO
3, alkalinity as
CaCO 3, TKN (total Keldahl nitrogen), MLVSS (mixed liquor
volatile suspended solids), etc.
2.2 FEDERAL LAWS
The formal break with the past for the United States with respectto pollution control was in 1965. In 1962, Rachel Carson ’sb o o k
Silent Spring (Carson, 1962) precipitated the environmental
movement that articulated public concerns about the environ-
ment and spawned a host of laws through the 1970s. TheEnvironmental Movement, although historic in itself, was actu-ally a part of a continuum of political events from the PublicHeath Movement initiated in the early nineteenth century inEngland and the Conservation Movement of Gifford Pinchot
and Theodore Roosevelt in the early twentieth century.
For engineers, the Environmental Movement resulted in a
basic shift in objectives for the design of wastewater treatment
plants. From about 1920 when wastewater treatment wasunderway, most statements of ambient water quality standardswere merely to eliminate sludge banks in streams, to prohibitﬂoatables, and to maintain slightly aerobic conditions, i.e.,2m g=L dissolved oxygen concentration. The idea was to
utilize the ‘‘assimilative capacity ’’of a given water body.
The main pollutants were BOD and suspended solids (SS).
The new ethic, however, as suggested by the 1965
law and made explicit by the 1972 law, called the CleanWater Act, was to eliminate the discharge of pollu-tants. In addition to the traditional pollutants, nutrients,i.e., phosphates and nitrates, became a concern along withtoxic pollutants. The alga blooms of Lake Erie symbolized
the nutrient problem, and the term eutrophication ,w h i c h
means nutrient-rich, became a household word. In addition,
the 1972 law required a NPDES permit to discharge pollu-tants. The result was a fundamental transformation in themodus operandi in design objectives for engineers and inthe regulation of pollutants.
In the ﬁeld of drinking water, the U.S. Congress passed the
Safe Drinking Water Act, PL93-523, in 1974. This was theﬁrst direct involvement of the federal government in drinking
water standards —a dramatic break with the past, which was to
change the U.S. water industry.
The passage of the Act was precipitated by an Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) report of trihalomethanes
(THMs) in New Orleans drinking water and their link to thehigher incidence of cancer. The 1986 amendments resulted inanother major change, i.e., that 83 substances were listed asdrinking water contaminants, with the provision that 25 con-
taminants were to be added every 3 years. The new ethic of
drinking water treatment was articulated by Abel Wolman in aluncheon speech at the 1985 annual conference of the Ameri-can Water Works Association with the phrase, ‘‘if in doubt,
take it out. ’’This phrase, coined by the icon in the ﬁeld,
encapsulated a paradigm shift toward articulated objectivesin water treatment that had been occurring since the passageof the Safe Drinking Water Act. This shift was similar in
character to the shift in water pollution control from the idea
of ‘‘assimilative capacity ’’toward the goal of ‘‘zero ’’pollutant
discharge (Box 2.2).
BOX 2.2 FEDERAL LAWS ON WATER
POLLUTION CONTROL
According to Dworsky (1967), water pollution was amajor public concern to the nation ’s 75 million people at
the beginning of the twentieth century. Congress in1912, however, made the decision to limit its interestto research and technical assistance and to leave to thestates the major role in controlling pollution. After theWorld War II, Congress passed the Water Pollution
Control Act of 1948, PL80-845. The Act included ﬁnan-
cial and technical aid and provision for research and
planning. The Act was amended in 1952, 1956, 1961,1965, and 1966. The 1956 amendment added a phrase,‘‘to establish a national policy for the prevention, con-
trol, and abatement of water pollution. ’’The 1965 Act
provided for the establishment of water quality stand-ards for interstate streams and other water bodies, giving
the states the responsibility, but federal action could be
taken in the face of state inaction. The 1972 amend-ments established the requirement for ef ﬂuent standards
and the National Pollution Discharge EliminationSystem (NPDES) permit. In 1970, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) was established by PresidentNixon to administer the environmental laws (with someexceptions). The Safe Drinking Water Act was enacted
in 1974 by PL93-523 and has had a similar sequence of
strengthening amendments.
The federal legislation culminated in the form of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensa-tion, and Liability Act (Superfund) and was enacted in1980 by PL96-510, spawning an industry on cleanup ofhazardous waste sites.Water Contaminants 252.2.1 L EGALDEFINITIONS
As a rule, terms used in federal legislation are de ﬁned; many
have been assimilated in the general lexicon on water quality.
Several are quoted here for reference.

deems appropriate.
(19) The term pollution means the man-made or man-induced
alteration of the chemical, physical, biological, and radio-
logical integrity of water.
2.2.2 R EGULATIONS
Federal agencies are charged with the responsibility to
implement federal laws. This is done in terms of regulations,which are published in the Federal Register as proposed
r u l e s ,a n dt h e na f t e rs u f ﬁcient comment period and hearing
if needed, a ﬁnal rule is published. Finally, the regulation is
‘‘codiﬁed’’ in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
These regulations are ‘‘regulatory law ’’and have the force
of law. Parties having an interest in the regulations may
comment and in ﬂuence the outcome as long as the public
interest is not compromised. The comments may provide
technical data and knowledge that expands the perspectiveof the agency and provide a forecast of economic impact andother consequences. Other part ies may argue for more strin-
gent regulations giving evidence of toxic effects to humansand ecological impacts. Finally, the regulations or theirinterpretation may be challenged in court (the court ruling
is‘‘judicial law ’’).
2.2.3 P RIORITY POLLUTANTS
The Priority Pollutant List originated from Section 307 of
PL92-500 (the 1972 Clean Water Act), which required EPAto regulate toxic pollutants. The Priority Pollutant List regu-lates the discharge of 126 contaminants listed in Section 40,CFR, Part 423, Appendix 2.A. The term ‘‘priority pollutant ’’
comes from a lawsuit in 1976 in which the National ResourceDefense Fund sued EPA in order to force the regulation ofspeciﬁc toxic compounds. A consent decree resulted from the
suit, which forced EPA to accept an additional 65 compounds.The expanded list was incorporated into the 1977 Clean WaterAct Amendments, PL95-217, and has become known as thePriority Pollutant List . The term ‘‘priority pollutant ’’has
become widely used, and so knowledge of its origin helps tounderstand what is meant.
One outcome was that EPA set numeric limits for 105
water contaminants required by February 1992, listed as
follows:26 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and BiologicalTable 2.3 lists the contaminants regulated under
Section 307. Of equal importance, the list gives a sense of
the variety of metals and organic compounds considered toxicabove certain threshold concentration limits and that are sub-ject to treatment. In other words, the idea of a pollutant hadbeen expanded well beyond the traditional notions, prevalenttill about 1960, that BOD and SS were the main concerns.
2.3 MATURATION OF WATER QUALITY
KNOWLEDGE
From the beginning, before about 1900, knowledge of watercontaminants evolved based upon developments that included
(1) the mother sciences —chemistry and microbiology, (2)
public mandates related to water quality standards, (3) speci ﬁc
knowledge about water contaminants and their ecological and
health effects, (4) criteria for various kinds of uses of water,and (5) analysis methods that provide measurement capabil-
ities to nanograms per liter. Thus, the state of knowledge,
although not complete, has come a long way from the incep-tion of the modern era of water treatment, i.e., since about1880 (Box 2.3).
2.3.1 K NOWLEDGE OF CONTAMINANTS
Theﬁrst formal compilation of substances that comprise water
quality was the 1952 book Water Quality Criteria by Profes-
sor Jack McKee of Cal Tech (and Partner, Camp, Dresser, andMcKee), commissioned by the State of California. The bookwas revised and expanded by Harold Wolfe in 1962. It was an
exhaustive treatise on substances that may be found in water
and the effects of different concentrations. A similar bookcalled the EPA Yellow Book was published in 1973
(USEPA, 1973), which had a wider distribution.TABLE 2.3

Prior to 1960, coliforms, turbidity, and pH were the main
concerns in drinking water, along with selected anions andcations —mainly those associated with hardness and alkalin-
ity. Water supplies with heavy metals were avoided. Chlorine
was an added constituent that required measurement. In was-
tewater, BOD and SS were the main concerns (after ﬂoatables,
scum, oil, and settable materials). The coliform density wasmeasured by the most probable number (MPN) method,which was supplemented about 1960 by the membrane ﬁlter
method. Cations and anions were measured by traditional wetchemistry methods involving titrations to some end point orconversion of a given substance to a colored complex that
followed the Lambert –Beer law and could be measured by a
spectrophotometer. The Jackson tube measured turbidity; this
was a tube with gradations, which was ﬁlled with water until
the light from a candle at the bottom was extinguished. Thereading was stated as Jackson Turbidity Units (JTU).
By the early 1960s, a major technological revolution was
underway in instrumental analysis. The TOC analyzer wasdeveloped, along with the atomic absorption instrument for
metal ions, the gas chromatograph for organic compounds,
polarography for speci ﬁc ion probes, and the mass spectro-
graph for any compounds. While these instruments becameavailable technologies in the 1960s, they were not usedwidely in water treatment until years later. These instrumentsdeveloped further in the 1970s in the degree of sensitivity, andsoon measurement in the range of micrograms per literbecame feasible (such as in gas chromatography). The ability
to measure organic compounds at concentrations in the range
of micrograms per liter made possible the development ofwater quality standards in the same range.
2.4 CATEGORIZATIONS OF CONTAMINANT
SPECIES
Contaminantspeciesnumber inthemillions.Such a large numberof species must be dealt with in terms of a classi ﬁcation system.
2.4.1 S YSTEMS OF CATEGORIZATION
There are several kinds of systems available for organizingwater quality knowledge. Examples include
.Alphabetical
.Chemical Abstract System (CAS) number
.Chemical category such as organic, syntheticorganic, inorganic, metal, etc.
.Class within a category such as alcohols, aldehydes,phthalates, etc.
.Regulatory lists, e.g., Safe Drinking Water ActRegulated Contaminants, Priority Pollutant List, etc.
Information concerning these contaminants was available inthe EPA Register of Lists (USEPA, 1991; Miller, 1993). TheRegister of Lists (not available by web access in 2010) cross-
referenced the chemicals with the statute listing and the EPA
ofﬁce administering. Such listing permitted cross-
referencing in terms of CAS number, contaminant type (e.g.,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, amine, organic acid, par-ticulate, etc.), empirical formula, contaminant classi ﬁcation
(e.g., organic, synthetic organic, volatile organic, inorganic,metal), and the law or regulation under which the contaminantis regulated (e.g., Priority Pollutant List, CWA Section 304,
CAA Section 112, RCRA, Sludge Regulations of February,
1993, SARA Section 313, SDWA).
2.4.2 I LLUSTRATIVE SYSTEM OF CONTAMINANT
CATEGORIZATION
As noted, contaminants may be categorized by a variety of
systems. Table 2.4 is another illustrative categorization of
contaminants. The system shown was devised, for use here,to illustrate the broad scope of contaminant categories, thelarge number of contaminant species, and the idea that con-taminant categorization may be devised to suit the purpose athand (but is not done arbitrarily). Table 2.5 lists some of themany pathogenic organisms, showing the associated diseases,and is included to give some idea of the microbial hazards of
untreated water. Figure 2.1 shows just three organisms that
may be found in ambient waters; tens or hundreds of micro-organism species are found commonly in a given sample ofambient water, depending on the source. Counts of an indi-vidual organism species could range from a few to severalthousand.BOX 2.3 THE IONISTS
To give an idea of how recent the notion of waterquality has been, the idea of expressing concentrations
of mineral substances in terms of ion concentration did
not catch on until after about 1900 (and certainly notbefore 1890). By about 1890, Svante Arrhenius ofUppsala, Jacobus Henricus van ’t Hoff at Amsterdam,
and Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig had formulated a com-prehensive theory of solutions and became known asthe ‘‘Ionists ’’(from Servos, 1990, pp. 13 –43).
To put in perspective the ionic theory of solutions,
the notion at the time was that a salt in solution retainedits identity as an undissociated compound. Thus, com-pounds in solution were called sulfate of alumina, sul-fate of calcium, chloride of sodium, etc., and not asions, e.g., Ca
2þ,C l/C0,S O 42/C0, etc. The ionic theory
was not embraced with enthusiasm as one might expect(e.g., being a conceptual ‘‘breakthrough ’’), but rather
with skepticism and doubt. The ionic theory displaced
the prevailing notions of solution only gradually, with
tradition hanging on for several decades after discovery.The practical signi ﬁcance is that if we are interested, for
example, in water quality data c. 1900, we must beprepared to deal with the old expressions.28 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and BiologicalTABLE 2.4

In water treatment, uses of water quality data include
1. Preliminary selection of unit processes: Source
water quality must be characterized over the time
period in which cyclical variation occurs (usuallyan annual cycle), and product water quality must bespeciﬁed.
2. Process control: Requires water quality monitoring
at selected node points in the treatment train inorder to verify proper operation and to diagnoseproblems.
3. Regulatory compliance: Requires sampling of the
efﬂuent to document compliance with standards or
criteria.
4. Monitoring of receiving waters: Con ﬁrms whether a
stream standard has been violated.
5. Laboratory analyses: Data from the laboratories must
be organized, understood, and utilized.
6. Data archiving: Data must be archived in a format
suitable for long-term storage and retrieval.
7. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
systems.
Monitoring sensors report to computers for display and use in
plant control. Pumps, valves, and motors are controlled.2.5.1 C ONTAMINANTS AND WATERUSES
As stated, contaminants that may be found in water number in
the thousands. The utility of water covers a wide variety of usessuch as drinking water, industrial water, cooling water, estheticappreciation, recreation contact, ecological habitats, irrigatedagriculture, etc. Each of these categories of water use may be
divided further. The objective of water quality criteria is to know
the limits of each contaminant level that will not impair the usesintended. The scope of the undertaking may be depicted in amatrix of muses in columns (perhaps several hundred columns
would adequately depict the uses) and of ncontaminants in rows
(which may number several thousand). The number of possibleinteractions, i.e., criteria, are several thousand, with size, m/C1n.
Since not all contaminants have a bearing on each use, the
problem may be reduced considerably, but still there are hun-dreds or thousands of criteria that must be delineated. Examplesof such criteria include (1) the electronics industry, where par-ticle-free water is required; (2) boiler feed water for electricenergy-generating plants, which must be ‘‘ion-free ’’water; (3)
growing of citrus crops, where boron levels must be less than 0.5mg=L, etc. These three examples indicate the natureof the criteria
determination issue, e.g., that in-depth knowledge about the
contaminant –use interaction must be generated. Most often,
criteria are more complex than just a simple number, e.g., tem-
perature affects how ﬁsh will survive under low dissolved oxy-
gen conditions, the effect of TDS in irrigated agriculture dependson the plant species and the amount of water applied, etc.
2.6 COMBINATIONS OF QUALITY OF SOURCE
WATERS AND PRODUCT WATERS
Source water quality and the required product water qualitydictate the design and operation of a treatment train. Eachsource water is different, and standards for product water varywith the kind of use. Examples of uses include drinking water,discharge of municipal wastewaters to a receiving body, pro-duction of particle-free and molecule-free process water formicrochip production, etc. The number of combinations is as
large as the number of possible water sources times the
number of possible water quality standards.
To the extent possible in water treatment where ambient
water is used, the water of highest quality is sought as asource. Since high-quality sources have been mostly appro-priated or are not available in some regions of countries,secondary sources have been committed to use to an increas-ingly greater extent. Thus, wastewaters are considered as
sources of water, assuming the associated water rights to
their use can be established. Also, as unit process technologiesdevelop and expand, the number of treatment optionsincrease, which may facilitate the use of lower-quality waters.The use of membranes, for example, has become increasinglymore economical since about the mid-1990s, which has madefeasible the use of even seawater as a source.

treatment trains.

In summary, the source water may be from any source and
the product water may be whatever is required to meet thepurpose of that water. Water quality must be characterized ineach case. As a rule, criteria and standards govern the target of
treatment.

APPENDIX 2.A: ORGANIC CARBON
AS A CONTAMINANT
Each contaminant has its own unique story with respect to its
occurrence in natural waters and in municipal and industrial
discharges, effects on uses of various kinds, the nature andrange of treatment for reduction in concentration, and regula-tory requirements and their evolution. The story of organiccarbon is reviewed here merely to illustrate the depth and34 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and Biologicalrange of substantive content that may be extracted from the
published material on a given contaminant. The organic car-
bon story (Box 2.A.1) is more extensive than most due to thehealth signi ﬁcance of carbonaceous DBPs in drinking water,
which started to be understood only since the mid-1970s. Inthe United States, the subsequent regulations from EPA pro-vided the mandates for the ensuing attention to DBPs. Thereview here is brief.According to Randtke (1988, p. 40), organic contaminants
in water may be grouped into three classes:
1.Natural organic matter (NOM): Humic substances,
microbial exudates, animal wastes, and products ofdegraded tissue
2.Synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs): Pesticides,
volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), and other chem-icals produced commercially or as waste products of
manufacturing
3.Chemical by-products and additives : Substances that
enter or are formed during treatment or in the distri-
bution system
NOM is the source of color —a traditional contaminant, and is
a precursor of DBPs, which are possible carcinogens, an issuesince the mid-1970s. In addition, the residual NOM after
treatment may serve as substrate for bacterial growths such
as in the distribution system. In the United States, the issues ofDBPs and SOCs and possible health effects led to the 1974Safe Drinking Water Act. Enforcement of the Act, by regula-tions, was stimulated by the capabilities to measure chemicalconcentrations in micrograms ( mg) per liter through develop-
ments in instrumental analyses methods. In the case of organiccompounds, such instrumental methods were exempli ﬁed by
advances in gas chromatography and mass spectrography andassociated lower costs (see Box 2.1).
2.A.1 C ATEGORIES OF ORGANICS IN WATER
The organics found in waters are characterized according tovarious schemes, depending upon the water and the purposeof the characterization. The characterization evolves as new
problems become known, and is a function of the purposes of
the waters being considered. Wastewaters, for example, havebeen characterized traditionally in terms of BOD and SS. TheBOD measurement is done by a 5 day BOD test and isdependent upon having a properly seeded test bottle. Thetest measures the organic carbon that is degraded in 5 daysby the microbe ’s species in the seed. The test does not meas-
ure TOC, but for a given wastewater, BOD may be propor-
tional to TOC. Only a portion of the organic carbon is
biodegradable, and the test measures the portion that is bio-degradable within a 5 day period. The test actually calculatesBOD based on the measured concentration of dissolved oxy-gen at the beginning and end of the test under incubation at208C for 5 days, taking into account the dilution of the sample
with ‘‘BOD ’’water. The BOD water contains a prescribed
mixture of nutrients, as speci ﬁed in Standard Methods , and is
saturated with oxygen. This test has its origin most probablyabout 1900.
For natural waters that are sources of municipal water
supplies, organic carbon was not of great concern until recentyears, i.e., beginning about 1973. NOM occurs in surfacewaters in concentrations mostly in the range 3 –6m g=L, and
as noted, is comprised mostly of humic and fulvic acids.These acids are products of decaying vegetative organicBOX 2.A.1 HUMIFICATION
Organic matter is comprised of humic and fulvic acids,indicating that their composition is of the same func-tional groups that make up lignins and, to a lesser
extent, other plant polymers; they have more carboxylic
acid functional groups, however, and they are surfaceactive. The components of humus consist of plant poly-mer segments that have been oxidized to carboxylicacid groups at one or more ends of the segments. Inthe case of lignin polymers, the unaltered segments aremore hydrophobic than the carboxylic groups. A mol-ecule that has both a hydrophobic (nonpolar) part and a
hydrophilic (polar) part is called an amphiphile .
Humi ﬁcation is a process by which biomass consist-
ing of dead plant and animal remains is converted to
humis; this is one of the basic steps of the carbon cycle.The organic compounds that make up plant and animaltissue are thermodynamically unstable in the oxidizingatmosphere of the earth ’s surface. The tissue is thus
converted back to carbon dioxide and water that are
catalyzed by enzymes from organisms. Some of the
tissue is, however, only partially oxidized, which isthe source of the organic compounds that accumulateas humus.
Vascular plants (those with water- and food-conduct-
ing tissues) are the dominant group in most terrestrialenvironments. The tissues of these plants consist ofthree groups of polymers: (1) cellulose, (2) hemicellu-
lose, and (3) lignin. Lesser quantities of aliphatic poly-
esters, starches, proteins, phenolic macromolecularspecies, and lipids are present also.
The degradation of plant polymers involves depoly-
merization and oxidation reactions that are catalyzed byenzymes. Polysaccharide polymers such as celluloseand hemicellulose usually undergo hydrolytic depoly-merization reactions, whereas lignin is degraded mainly
by oxidation. Lipids undergo hydrolysis and oxidation.
The products from lignin and lipid degradation are, ingeneral, oxidized fragments in which much of thechemical structure of the original polymer is preserved.
In addition to amphiphiles produced by degradation,
some of the lignin in wood is present as amphiphiliclignin –carbohydrate complexes. These complexes have
number average molecular weights on the order of
6000–8000 Da.Water Contaminants 35matter that ﬁnds its way into ambient waters after rainfall, and
of the decay of organic matter within a water body.
NOM causes the water to exhibit ‘‘color, ’’measured in
terms of ‘‘standard color units ’’(SCU). Color, per se, has no
health signi ﬁcance, but it does cause concern as it affects
palatability of a drinking water. Since there is no health
signiﬁcance to color, it was assigned the status of a ‘‘second-
ary standard ’’in the 1973 Safe Drinking Water Act
(PL93-523). Color has been considered as a parameter of
drinking water quality since about the 1920s, and its reduction
has been a traditional objective of water treatment (achievedby coagulation, and as measured by the ‘‘jar ’’test).
In the early 1970s, chlorinated organics were identi ﬁed as
carcinogens (Box 2.A.2) based on reports of higher levels ofTHMs in New Orleans drinking water, which precipitatedthe 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) —theﬁrst
BOX 2.A.2 DISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS
AS A NATIONAL ISSUE
A review of how disinfection by-products (DBPs)became a national issue was reviewed by James M.Symons (2001a,b), who, in the1970s, was Chief of thePhysical and Chemical Contaminants Removal Branch,Drinking Water Research Division, USEPA, Cincinnati.
This position provided the vantage point of both per-
spective and responsibility to provide initiative.
Johannes Rook, a chemist with the Rotterdam Water
Works, discovered chloroform in Rotterdam ’sd r i n k i n g
water in 1971 while looking for sources of taste andodor, based on a ‘‘head-space ’’sampling =analysis tech-
nique he developed. Although he took special note of thechloroform as one among a score of micropollutants,
there was not any special alarm, especially since the
health of ﬁcer mentioned that chloroform was a constitu-
ent of cough syrup and was not know as a toxin.
Also in 1971, Thomas Bellar, a chemist with EPA, was
given an assignment to develop an adequate method tomeasure VOC contaminants in wastewater. The methoddeveloped was called by Bellar the ‘‘purge and trap ’’
technique, which was an adjunct to gas chromatography.
This was an analytical ‘‘breakthrough, ’’which opened the
door for detecting and measuring organic contaminants at
themg=L level. In measuring contaminants in samples of
tap water, Bellar found chloroform but attributed theﬁnding to laboratory contamination. In mid-1973, con-
tinuing to ﬁnd chloroform, he decided to sample other
drinking water sources. In sampling at several points inthe water treatment train for the City of Cincinnati, he
found that DBPs were related to the points of chlorination.
For example, chloroform concentrations were (1) OhioRiver, 0.9 mg=L; (2) 80 min after chlorination and alum
coagulation, 22.1 mg=L; (3) 3 day settled water, 60.8
mg=L; (4) treatment plant settled water following chlorin-
ation, 127 mg=L; (5) ﬁlter ef ﬂuent (after powderedactivated carbon and ﬁltration), 83.9 mg=L; and (6)
ﬁnished water after a ﬁnal chlorination, 94.0 mg=L.
In early 1974, the EPA drinking water group pondered
what to do about Bellar ’sﬁndings. Since the oral lethal
dose was 120 mg =L, the issue seemed not an acute prob-
lem. In June 1974, however, an article in Consumer
Reports reviewed the problem of organics in drinking
water. The article was based partly on a 1972 report byUSEPA and was to have strong in ﬂuence on future events.
The article was an indictment of the water quality of theLower Mississippi River and stimulated public interest inthe problem of organics in drinking water. James Symonsreturned to Europe in August 1974, and Rook describedh i st h e o r yt h a tN O M ,a sm e a s u r e db yc o l o r ,w a sap r e c u r -sor to THM formation; his data showed a correlation
between TTHM in mg=L and color in Pt –Co units, and
other possible precursors were eliminated by experiment
and deduction. At that time, the structure of humicsubstances were not well de ﬁned. This meeting with
Rook, and his evidence that color was a likely precursorto THMs, had a strong in ﬂuence on Symons relative to the
possible extent of the problem of THM ’s in drinking
water. Further stops in Europe, e.g., at the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology and at Karlsruhe, led to the deci-
sion at EPA that the THM issue was indeed important.Then, the National Organics Reconnaissance Survey wasstarted to ascertain how widespread the problem ofTHMs was in the United States. Following this, inNovember 1974, the Environmental Defense Fundreleased an epidemiological study showing that diseaserates for persons drinking New Orleans water were higher
than those persons living in surrounding communities and
drinking water from sources other than the MississippiRiver. At the same time, a medical faculty member at theUniversity of New Orleans stated that he had found halo-gen-substituted organic compounds in the blood of NewOrleans residents. He also stated on national televisionthat the water quality (i.e., with respect to chloroform)from the Mississippi River was of considerably better
quality than the water produced by the water treatment
plant. In December 1974, with an atmosphere that causeda lessening of public con ﬁdence in the drinking water
industry, the Safe Drinking Water Act (PL93-523) wassigned by President Ford.
The national publicity led to pointed criticisms of the
drinking water industry. Further, many in the industrycould not believe that the trace concentrations of chem-
icals could be hazardous to public health. (As an edi-
torial aside, the THM issue and the later Giardia issue,
which emerged in 1978, were combined stimuli thatcaused a major change in the culture of the U.S. waterindustry. The drinking water industry became energizedand perhaps one might say the ‘‘glamour ’’ﬁeld, which,
during the 1960s, was in wastewater treatment.)36 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and Biologicalnational legislation that would enforce nationwide drinking
water standards. Consequently, pursuant to the 1973 SDWA,
THM, one of the implicated species of chlorinated hydrocar-bons, was regulated in 1978 with a MCL set at 100 mg=L.
Subsequent research implicated the whole family of chlorin-ated hydrocarbons as being possibly carcinogenic, and also avariety of other organic compounds. Thus, in 1986, whenthe SDWA was reauthorized, the number of regulated con-taminants in drinking water was expanded from 25 from
the 1962 USPHS-recommended drinking water standards
(Anon, 1962), to 83, with the requirement stipulated in thelaw that 25 new contaminants be added to the list every3 years. The expanded list included natural organics, syn-thetic organics, and volatile organics. The change fromrecommended federal standards to mandated ones constituteda fundamental shift in the treatment of drinking water.
As the issue developed, the whole family of halogens, i.e.,
chlorine, bromine, and iodine, were implicated. The associ-ated species of halogenated organic compounds, collectively,were termed TOX. Also, measures of THMs were developed.For example, by exposing a sample of organic carbon tochlorine for 24 h, measuring chlorine concentration beforeand after the test gives a measure called trihalomethane for-mation potential (THMFP-24 h). The same test extended for96 h gives THMFP-96 h.
2.A.1.1 Color
Traditionally, dating back to perhaps 1915, the concern with
organic matter was color, which was not pleasing esthetically.
Other concerns were with its deleterious effects on industrialprocess waters, its chlorine demand, and interference withcoagulation. The USPHS 1962 Drinking Water Standard setthe limit as 15 color units on the platinum –cobalt scale, but
the AWWA set/C203 units as a goal for drinking water.
Regarding ambient waters, the color units for snowmelt
mountain streams are low, e.g., <5, but may rise to perhaps
50 units during spring runoff. By contrast, for swamp-likewaters in the southeastern United States, color units may varyin the range 68 –424. Examples of waters in this range include
the Suwannee River at Fargo, Georgia; the Florida Everglades20 miles northwest of Miami; and the Great Dismal Swampnear Norfolk, Virginia (Black and Christman, 1963).
2.A.1.2 Organic Carbon
An index of the organic content of water is TOC, which is a
measure of all organic molecules in a water sample (i.e., thosethat are subject to being converted to carbon dioxide for meas-urement by infrared absorbance using a TOC analyzer). Figure
2.A.1 shows the ranges of TOC concentrations in seawater,
groundwaters, surface waters, and raw and treated wastewaters.
More than 700 speci ﬁc organic chemicals were identi ﬁed
in various drinking water sources in the United States in 1978(FR43 (28):5759, Feb. 9, 1978). These compounds were from
industrial and municipal discharges, urban and rural runoff,natural decomposition of vegetative and animal matter, andchlorination of water and wastewater.At the time of the passage of the SDWA in December 1974,
there were more than 12,000 chemical compounds known to
be in commercial use, and many new compounds were being
added to the list each year. These were called SOCs andincluded halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbonssuch as carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, vinyl chloride,and chlorobenzenes; pesticides such as dieldrin and lindane;aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and styrene; polynucleararomatics such as ﬂuoranthene; nitrogenous compounds such
as aniline and dinitrobenzene; esters such as dibutylphthalate;
and many others.
2.A.1.3 UV
254
Since the mid-1980s, UV 254absorbance has been accepted as
a surrogate for TOC. Semmens and Field (1980, p. 477) used
UV 260(i.e., an ultraviolet light source at 260 nm wavelength),
understanding the nature of the relationship. The use of UVconverged on the 254 nm wavelength as the 1980s pro-gressed, and was adopted by Hubel and Edzwald (1987)and others.
2.A.1.4 Synthetic Organic Carbon
Synthetic organic carbon compounds number in the tens of
thousands and include pesticides and herbicides. This topic ismentioned to indicate its importance, but discussion is beyondthe scope of this appendix.
2.A.2 D ISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS
The most abundant of the DBPs are from reactions with chlor-ine, with fewer from chloramines and chlorine dioxide, butwith six from ozone. Chlorine has been the oxidant investi-gated most extensively. To illustrate a few structural formulaefor some typical DBPs, Table 2.A.1 shows several representa-tive groups. Each compound, i.e., each DBP, could be a part ofany total organic halogen (TOX) measure.

As to the reactions between chloramines and organic car-
bon, the TOX production is about the same as that resultingfrom chlorine (Johnson and Jensen, 1986). Further, the healtheffects of chloramines-treated water are nearly as severe asthose of chlorine-treated water. Thus, while the chloraminesolves the THM problem, it does not solve the health problemthat the THM regulation was intended to address.
2.A.3 D ISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS IN SECONDARY
EFFLUENTS
A question pertinent to wastewater treatment is the suscepti-bility of municipal wastewaters to the formation of DBPs.Such contaminants could constitute a hazard to aquatic lifeor a problem for downstream drinking water treatment plants.Glaze and Henderson (1975) investigated this issue by‘‘super-chlorinating ’’(deﬁned for their work as 2000 mg =L
chlorine by gas injection, with 60 min contact time) theefﬂuent from the secondary clari ﬁers at the Denton, Texas,
wastewater treatment plant. For reference, 10 mg =L chlorine
is a typical dosage of chlorine for wastewaters.
Their gas chromatograms showed over 100 peaks with
more than 30 halogenated species detected, identiﬁed inTable 2.A.2; most were aromatic derivatives. Some importantpoints are (1) a host of chlorinated organic compounds formwhen a secondary ef ﬂuent is subjected to chlorination, and (2)
concentrations are in the mg=L range. These compounds
formed also using a 10 mg =L chlorine dosage.TABLE 2.A.2

Whenever disinfection occurs, oxidation also occurs. For a
‘‘safe ’’disinfection technology, (1) use a ‘‘safe ’’disinfectant
and (2) remove the precursors to oxidation by-products beforedisinfecting (Trussell, 1992).
Regarding the distribution system, maintenance of a disin-
fectant residual is important. For factors to consider, include(1) residual stability, (2) residual toxicity, (3) effectivenessin bio ﬁlm control, and (4) Oxidation by-product issues
(Trussell, 1992).
2.A.5 O THERNOTES
The formation of chlorinated by-products increases withelapsed time. To illustrate, Figure 2.A.2 shows experimental
data from chlorination of fulvic acids (HOCl ¼20 mg =L,
pH¼7.0, TOC¼4.1 mg =L) (Reckhow and Singer, 1984).
The total halide concentration, TOX, was greater than 1100
mg=L after 300 h, with about 600 mg=L after 10 h. Also, as
seen, the CHCl
3, TCAA, and DCAA concentrations were
signiﬁcant fractions of the TOX concentration.
GLOSSARY
Aromatic compound: A class of molecules with six carbons
and six hydrogens in a ring. A key property is theirremarkable stability (Aihara, 1992, p. 62), whichmakes them valuable for many uses, e.g., paint thin-ner, mothball, gasoline additive, solvents, and as asource for synthetic ﬁbers, resins, and dyes. The
carbons are arranged in a closed hexagonal ring —a
structure that does not want to react. The ring structureis the distinguishing aspect of the aromatic com-
pounds. Ordinary combustion produces a wide variety
of aromatic compounds. Ideally, when hydrocarbonfuels burn, they should form carbon dioxide andwater; in reality, complete combustion is rare, andthe soot and smoke contain a number of multiring orpolycyclic, aromatic compounds, some of which arehighly toxic.
Benzene: A ring compound with six carbons and six hydro-
gens, it is the prototype of a class of moleculesknown as the aromatic compounds.
Carcinogen: Substance that may cause the development of
cancer after exposure at some threshold level or timeduration.
Color: Substance in water that causes ‘‘color ’’as measured
on the cobalt scale. Two kinds of color are ‘‘appar-
ent ’’color and ‘‘true ’’color. The former is the
result of a measurement using a sample of water‘‘as is, ’’and the latter is the same measurement
after ﬁltering. Organic color is associated with nat-
ural organic matter.
Contaminant: (1) A substance in water other than molecular
water. (2) A species added to another species thatserves as a matrix. A few molecules of sodium chlorideadded to a liter of water is a contaminant. (3) To
make impure or corrupt by contact or mixture. A
contaminant is a substance that is added to a puresubstance.
Criterion: A standard, rule, or test on which a judgment or
decision can be based.
Disinfection by-products (DBPs): The reactions of various
disinfectants, e.g., chlorine, bromine, and ozone,with organic matter —natural organic matter in par-
ticular —result in a variety of by-products.
Disinfection by-product precursor: The reactions of various
disinfectants, e.g., chlorine, bromine.
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC): Organic carbon passing a
0.45mmﬁlter (Edzwald, 1993, p. 24).
Fulvic acid: Similar to humic acids, except it is soluble at
pH¼1.0 and believed to be in true solution vis-à-vis
being colloidal (Randtke, 1988, p. 43). MW <5000
and can be removed by GAC. Most DBPs are due toreactions with fulvic acid.
Geometric mean ( n.):Mathematics (1) The nth root,
usually the positive nth root, of a product of nfac-
tors. Parkhurst (1998) states: The geometric meanis the antilog of the mean logarithm of a set ofnumbers or, equivalently, the nth root of the product
ofnnumbers. State health departments use this
term frequently in referring to concentrations oforganisms.
Humic acids: High-M Wnegatively
 charged macromolecules
having colloidal properties (Edzwald, 1993, p. 24).Also, they are insoluble at pH ¼2.0 (Van Benscho-
ten and Edzwald, 1990, p. 1527). MW >30,000.
Humi ﬁcation: Humi ﬁcation is a process by which biomass
consisting of dead plant and animal remains is con-
verted to humis; this is one of the basic steps of the
carbon cycle.
Log-normal distribution: The logarithms of the concentra-
tions have a normal distribution. It is common stat-istical practice to transform such sampleconcentrations to logs before estimating con ﬁdence
limits or performing statistical tests such as analysisof variance or ttests (Parkhurst, 1998). This term is
found frequently in the literature.
Molality: Mass of a solute per unit mass of solvent, i.e.,
moles(solute) =moles(solvent).
Molarity: Mass of a solute per unit volume of solvent, i.e.,
moles(solute) =V(solvent).
Mole fraction: In a given volume, the amount of a dissolved
substance iin moles, i.e., n
i, divided by the summa-
tion of the moles of all substances in the solution, n;
i.e., mole fraction i¼ni=n.
Natural organic matter (NOM): The whole group of natural
organic substances of which humic substances area part.
Normative: Of, relating to, or prescribing a norm or standard:
normative grammar. Related to the ‘‘norms ’’of a
given culture.40 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and BiologicalNPT: Normal temperature and pressure, de ﬁned as 0 8C and
101.325 kPa (1.00 atm), used mostly in European
publications.
Palatable: (1) Acceptable to the taste ( American Heritage
Dictionary , 1996). (2) In potable water treatment,
a drinking water palatability is measured in termsof taste, odor, color, and turbidity.
Particulate organic carbon (POC): Organic carbon passing
retained by a 0.45 mmﬁlter. Usually, POC is a small
fraction of the TOC compared to DOC and includesbacteria, algae, zooplankton, and organic detritus(Edzwald, 1993, p. 24).
Pollutant: (1) A contaminant level that interferes with, or is
perceived to interfere with, a particular use of water.(2) (n.) Something that pollutes, especially a waste
material that contaminates air, soil, or water. (3) ( n.)
Something that pollutes, especially a harmful chem-
ical or waste material discharged into the water or
atmosphere.
Potable: Fit to drink ( American Heritage Dictionary , 1996).
Speci ﬁc:A physical quantity divided by its mass; examples
include speci ﬁc heat capacity, speci ﬁc weight (from
Elias, 1997, p. 444).
Standard: An acknowledged measure of comparison for
quantitative or qualitative value; a criterion.
State: The ‘‘state ’’of a parcel of water is de ﬁned by its
physical and chemical characteristics. In physicalchemistry, pressure, temperature, and volume are‘‘state ’’parameters. In a more general sense as
applied to unit processes, we would include con-centrations of particles and dissolved moleculesand ions.
STP: Standard temperature and pressure de ﬁned as 20 8C and
101.325 kPa (1.00 atm).
Surrogate: A substitute; a quantity that takes the place of
another.
Total organic carbon (TOC): All carbon in water when
measured by a total organic carbon analyzer is con-verted to carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide gasis then measured by an infrared wavelength absorb-ance, calibrated in terms of mg C =L.
TOX: Total organic halides. The principal halides are chlor-
ine, bromine, and iodine ( ﬂuorine is also a halogen).
If any of these elements react with any organiccompound, the product may be termed an organichalide. Thus, the multitude of halogenatedorganic compounds may be represented collectivelyby a single parameter, TOX, in lieu of trying toidentify each species present and the respective con-
centrations.
Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP): The
results of a test in which a given water sample is
exposed to a known concentration of chlorineand permitted to react over a given time duration,e.g., 24 or 96 h. The loss of chlorine is a measureof THMFP.Utility: The quality or condition of being useful; usefulness.
UV
254:Ultraviolet light wavelength, which refers to absorb-
ance of the 254 nm wavelength by a water sample ina standard cuvette. The 254 nm wavelength has beenaccepted as a surrogate for TOC.

In education, especially at the undergraduate level, we empha-
size problems in which the parameters are well de ﬁned. In
practice, however, this is not the reality. Knowledge may beincomplete: data on inputs may be lacking, methods of solu-tion may not be well delineated, and even the objectives maybe nebulous. All of this is contrary to the common perception
of engineering, i.e., that it is deterministic and largely a matter
of computation.
This chapter examines some of the approaches for attack-
ing problems. The concept of modeling is a theme common toall. Modeling is an engineering method (Box 3.1).
3.1 UNIT PROCESSES
About 10 –15 unit processes comprise the ﬁeld of water treat-
ment, depending on how they are categorized. Perhaps thereare 80 –100 technologies developed from them. Table 3.1 lists
13 unit processes and associated technologies. Fundamentalprinciples operative include
.Sieving of particles by screens (ranging from bac-teria by membranes to large objects by bar screens)
.Creating conditions for application of a ‘‘passive ’’
force on particles (e.g., gravity), or an ‘‘active ’’force
(e.g., centrifugal) to cause transport
.Turbulence and diffusion for the transport of par-ticles to cause contacts between reactants
.Charge neutralization
.van der Waals attraction between molecules and asurface (such as activated carbon), or charge attraction(such as between ions and an ion-exchanger material)
.Various chemical reactions such as
.Redox, acid –base
.Precipitation
.Complexation
.Biochemical
.Cell synthesis
.Membrane processes involving retention of ions andmolecules, i.e., reverse osmosis =nanoﬁltration
Generally, the unit processes listed in Table 3.1 are the resultsfrom a heritage of only since about 1900, albeit the earliesttechnology was slow sand, with the ﬁrst installation in 1829
for London. Proprietary innovations have expanded the arrayof technologies, but most are variations of the unit processeslisted in Table 3.1.3.2 MODELS
A model is a means to represent a portion of a reality. Themodel is ‘‘valid ’’if the points of the model predict accurately
the corresponding points of the system being modeled. As arule, the system being modeled, i.e., the ‘‘prototype,’’ is a full-
scale process. Examples include an activated sludge reactor, abioﬁlm reactor, a plate settler, a slow sand ﬁlter, a rapid rate
ﬁltration system, a granular activated carbon reactor, an ozonereactor, etc. Natural systems may be modeled also, e.g., waterquality of streams and lakes, groundwater, etc., with math-ematical models being a primary method of determining the
effects of pollutant discharges on such systems.
Table 3.2 lists various forms of models and describes their
respective characteristics and positive and negative attributes.
The notion of what may comprise a model, Table 3.2, illus-trates that a wide range of forms may be encompassed. Thus, amodel may include lore, judgment, description, bench testing,pilot plants, demonstration plants, and mathematical models.
3.2.1 C ATEGORIES OF MODELS
A model is a means to ‘‘represent. ’’Thus, a photograph is a
model, along with language, a drawing, a painting, a map, aplot, an equation, an array of 0 and 1 digits stored in acomputer, or any kind of representation. To be an engineeringmodel, this is necessary but not suf ﬁcient. An engineering
model, we might assert, must also have utility in projecting
from the unknown to the known.
More commonly in engineering, we think of a model in
terms of a pilot plant or as a set of coordinated equations in a
computer algorithm or in a spreadsheet or even a single equa-tion. Table 3.2 lists some of the more common things that wedo in engineering that are really ‘‘forms ’’of models. They
qualify as meeting the requirements of a ‘‘model, ’’as deﬁned
here. Indeed, the various model forms comprise engineering
practice, e.g., lore, judgment, extrapolation, bench scale test-
ing, pilot plants, demonstration plants, and mathematical mod-eling. As an additional note, each model form in Table 3.2 maybe thought of as a ‘‘black box. ’’In other words, a model as a
‘‘black box ’’accepts a set of ‘‘inputs, ’’without regard to how it
works, and generates outputs.
3.2.2 T HEBLACKBOX
The proverbial ‘‘black box ’’has its place as a primary engin-
eering method. Figure 3.1 depicts the concept of the black
45box, illustrating the idea of how the values of dependent
variables are generated by maintaining yand zconstant
while varying x;fandcare measured for each level of xat
ﬁxed values of yandz. Then yis changed to a new value, and
the process is repeated. After all the values of yare explored, z
may be changed to a new level, and the foregoing is repeatedfor each value of zthat is to be explored. Suppose that there
are 5 levels of x,8o f y, and 10 of z. Then the number of
experiments would be 5 /C28/C210¼400. In exploring a hypo-
thetical ‘‘surface, ’’a substantial amount of effort is required.
An example of the foregoing in more concrete terms is thetraditional jar test. Thousands of experiments may be donewhere a treatment process is being explored, i.e., to determinecoagulant dosage, x, and polymer dosage, y, for several sea-
sonal water quality conditions, z.
The ‘‘black box ’’is a device to generate outputs (depen-
dent variables —fandc) from selected inputs (independent
variables —x,y,z), which may de ﬁne a useful portion of a
functional relationship. Virtually any means to generate out-puts from inputs can be considered a ‘‘black box. ’’Such
means could include judgment, physical models, and math-ematical models.3.2.2.1 Plots
The kind of experimental program outlined above might
be called ‘‘parametric exploration. ’’Figure 3.2 illustrates the
output of fas a function of xandy,w i t h zconstant, i.e., fv/C1x
fory¼y
1,y2,..., ynandz¼z1, where zrepresents a set of
conditions that are maintained constant during the testing. Tobe more speci ﬁc, the system being modeled is a rotating drum
microscreen. The ﬂow of water through the screen divided by
its submerged area is the velocity of water through the screen,v, which is the ‘‘dependent ’’variable, i.e., f. Then vis
affected by the independent variables, headloss, h, across the
screen, as seen by the curve and the rotational velocity, v,o f
the drum, in which handvcorrespond to xandy, respect-
ively. The set of curves of Figure 3.2 is for all other conditionsbeing maintained constant. If, for example, the suspension
changes (such as one species of algae instead of another) or
the screen size changes, then another set of conditions existsand another set of curves must be generated. Thus, a set of oneor more plots, such as seen in Figure 3.2, is the end result of ablack box experimental program.
3.2.3 P HYSICAL MODELS
A physical model is a smaller-scale setup of equipmentintended to replicate the process being considered. One appealof a physical model is that variables not anticipated are includedpassively. The outputs, i.e., dependent variables, thus re ﬂect all
independent variables, not just the ones identi ﬁed.
With the smaller scale, the model is cheaper and easier to
operate than a full-scale system. Further, the independent
variables can be controlled so that the inﬂuence of each on
the dependent variables can be investigated. Physical modelsinclude bench scale testing, pilot plants, and demonstrationscale plants.
3.2.3.1 Bench Scale Testing
Bench scale testing may include jar tests to determine chemical
dosages, kinetic coef ﬁcients, isotherm constants, and generat-
ing relationships between various other kinds of intensivevariables. The testing is ‘‘one dimensional ’’in nature, i.e., the
intent is to examine the in ﬂuences of only one or two inde-
pendent variables (such as screen size) in selected dependent
variables (such as ef ﬂuent concentration).
3.2.3.2 Pilot Plants
One purpose of a pilot plant is to generate functional relation-
ships between dependent and independent variables. Theextent to which this is done, i.e., the scope of the experimentalprogram, depends upon the nature of the problem and the
budget available.
Another purpose of a pilot plant study may be to determine
coefﬁcients of a mathematical model. A mathematical model
has greater utility than a set of plots.
Pilot plant experiments will yield, almost without exception,
unexpected results that lead to new insights and serendipitous
ﬁndings. Thus, any plan devised in anticipation of a set ofresults should have ﬂexibility to incorporate new ﬁndings.BOX 3.1 PHILOSOPHY OF MODELING
Modeling has two themes of logic: inductive anddeductive, formalized by Sir Francis Bacon (1561 –
1626) and René Descartes (1596 –1650), respectively.
Bacon extolled observation and practical outcomes,while Descartes believed that pure reasoning was thebasis for problem solving (Durant, 1926).
The essence of empiricism is observation. Engineer-
ing forms include bench scale testing, pilot plants, dem-onstration plants, evaluations of existing plants, etc.Also included in this category are judgment, lore, and‘‘black box ’’approaches. Rational models include equa-
tions based on a premise leading to an understanding ofprocess mechanisms. Mathematical modeling, scen-arios, animations, etc., are modern outcomes. Mostproblem solving is a blend of empiricism and rationalityrather than being exclusively one or the other.
The organization and displays of solutions are
important also, as the amount of data generated byphysical models or computer models may be over-
whelming. Spreadsheets and plots provide a means to
organize and present results such that a wide range ofconditions can be communicated easily and clearly.Computer animations provide a means to display suc-cinctly and to grasp more easily complex results thatcould be otherwise dif ﬁcult to assimilate.
All of these various kinds of models have roles in
engineering problem solving. Even when we know little
about a problem, some form of model provides a means
to identify variables, organize data, test assumptions,generate plausible solutions, and communicate results.46 Fundamentals of Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical, Chemical, and Biological3.2.3.3 Demonstration Plants
A demonstration plant is similar to a pilot plant but is larger in
scale. The scale is too large, as a rule, to generate economic-ally the functional relationships between dependent and inde-pendent variables. There are many variables that may bedifﬁcult to control, e.g., temperature, in ﬂuent concentration,
etc. At the same time, the fact that the demonstration plantoperates continuously means that the processes must handlethe variations in input variables and exigencies that existin the ‘‘real world. ’’An example may be with the liner usedfor the steel tanks that de ﬁne the volume of an activated
carbon reactor, which may be acrylic or PVC in a pilotplant. Steel is subject to corrosion, and so a liner (e.g., rubberorﬁberglass) is used, which is subject to pinholes or cracks.
Many problems of this nature are not identi ﬁed before the
plant is constructed, and so the demonstration scale permitsboth problem identi ﬁcation and evaluation.
Ostensibly, the demonstration plant should be a ‘‘capstone ’’
study for a contemplated full-scale plant. A demonstration
plant, however, is large enough to ascertain the impacts ofTABLE 3.1

Examples include the Denver Potable Water Reuse Plantand Water Factory 21 in Orange County, California. Theseplants have been highly visible and prominent facilities evok-ing a great deal of public interest as well as political support.3.2.4 M ATHEMATICAL MODELS
A mathematical model epitomizes the deductive approach.
The mathematical model starts with a premise. From the
premise, we build an ‘‘ediﬁce, ’’i.e., the mathematical
model. If the premise is not valid, neither is the model.
A system is represented by mathematical relationships that
relate dependent variables to independent variables. Usuallycoefﬁcients or constants are a part of the equations (see
Example 5.3).
3.2.5 C OMPUTER MODELS
A computer model is sometimes an extension of a mathemat-ical model, but not necessarily. As an extension of a math-ematical model, the computer model may represent a‘‘complex ’’system depicted by equations, with outputs from
one unit comprising inputs to another. The computer model insuch a case is a means for ‘‘bookkeeping ’’as variables change
in space and time. The steps in organizing the computationalscheme are called an ‘‘algorithm. ’’TABLE 3.2
