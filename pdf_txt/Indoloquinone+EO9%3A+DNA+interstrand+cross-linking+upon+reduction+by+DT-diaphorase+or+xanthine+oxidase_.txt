In a phase II trial, the activity of E09, a new bioreductive alkylating agent, was assessed. E09 was 
used as second-line chemotherapy in breast cancer patients and as first-line chemotherapy for 
patients with gastric, pancreatic and colorectal cancer. E09 was given as a 5 min i.v. infusion at a 
weekly dose of 12 mg/m*. 92 patients were entered; 22 with breast cancer, 26 with colon cancer, 24 
with pancreatic cancer and 20 with gastric cancer. In general, the drug was well tolerated with nau- 
sea and vomiting occurring in 26.42 and 13.3% of courses, respectively. Reversible proteinuria was 
the main toxicity occurring in 45% of courses. Antitumour activity was not observed. At this dose 
and schedule, E09 is not an active drug in the type of tumour studied. Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier

INTRODUCTION 
E09 (3-hydroxy-5-aziridinyl-1 -methyl-2-( 1 H-indole-4,7- 
dione)-prop-p-en-a-01) was selected for clinical evaluation 
as the leading compound of a series of bioreductive cyto- 
toxic agents. E09, an indoloquinone synthesised by 
Oostveen and Speckamp [l] is structurally related to 
mitomycin C [ 1, 21. Its mechanism of action is con- 
sidered to be a bioreductive alkylation, with the activation 
being catalysed by the two-electron donating flavoenzyme, 
DT-diaphorase (EC 1.6.99.2) [2]. This reduction gener- 
ates DNA damaging species in z&o, with the develop- 
ment of DNA single strand breaks and cross-links [3].

Received 9 Apr. 1996; accepted 28 May 1996. Different in vitro studies have suggested a close relation- 
ship between cellular DT-diaphorase content and sensi- 
tivity of a particular cell line to E09 [4-61. 
The preclinical evaluation in the disease-oriented cell 
line panel of the National Cancer Institute showed a pre- 
ferential activity against solid tumour-derived cell lines, 
with lack of activity against lympho-leukaemic cell lines 
[7]. The in viva activity was quite similar. Toxicity data 
showed a LDia in mice after a single administration of 9 
mgikg (27 mg/m2). 
The increased efficacy under hypoxic conditions and the 
lack of haematological toxicity in animals were reasons to 
select this agent for phase I studies within the framework of 
the Early Clinical Studies Group of the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
2019 2020 L.Y. Dirix et al. 
(EORTC). In the first phase I study, using a 3-weekly sche- 
dule, starting at 2.7 mg/m’ and escalating up to 27 mg/m*, 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) proved to be proteinuria, salt 
and water retention and elevation of serum creatinine [8]. 
The recommended dose for phase II studies was 22 mg/m*. 
Pharmacological studies showed a rapid elimination with a 
t1/2 of 0.8 to 19 min. The AUC was linearly related to the 
administered dose. Pharmacodynamic analysis indicated a 
sigmoidal relationship between the AUC and the protei- 
nuria. In a second phase I study, the drug was given weekly 
and the DLT also proved to be proteinuria, reached with a 
dose of 15 mg/m* once weekly. A dose of 12 mg/m* proved 
to be safe. On the basis of these two studies, the dose of 12 
mg/m* weekly was selected since the total dose of E09 
given in 3 weeks exceeded the 3 weekly dose (36 mg/m* 
over 22 mg/m2). 
The Early Clinical Studies Group (ECSG) of the 
EORTC initiated phase II studies with E09 as a weekly 
bolus injection of 12 mg/m2 in patients with breast, pan- 
creatic, gastric and colon cancer. 
Eligibility PATIENTS AND METHODS 
All patients entered into these four trials had to have his- 
tologically or cytologically verified advanced measurable 
malignant disease beyond resectability. In patients with pan- 
creatic cancer with only local disease present, the indicator 
lesion needed to be at least 3 cm in diameter. Patients had 
to be at least 18 years of age, have a WHO performance 
status < 2, a WBC > 2OOO/ul and a platelet count > 75 0001 
~1. Normal liver (exception in case of liver metastases) and 
kidney function were required and proteinuria was not 
allowed. Retrospectively, patients with minimal initial pro- 
teinuria which was within the normal limits of their institute 
were accepted since analysis of toxicity data did not show 
any difference between this group and the group without 
pretreatment proteinuria. Patients with pancreatic and 
stomach cancer could not have received any prior chemo- 
therapy. Prior treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy was 
allowed for patients with colorectal carcinoma, provided the 
treatment-free interval was more than a year. For patients 
with breast cancer, chemotherapy both in the adjuvant set- ting and/or first line for metastatic disease was allowed. 
Pretreatment with mitomycin C was not permitted. 
Formulation, dosage and treatment procedures 
E09 was provided by Kyowa-Hakko Kogio (Tokyo, 
Japan) as a freeze-dried powder. It was dissolved in sterile 
saline to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and administered as 
an intravenous bolus injection over 5 min. The drug was 
given at a dose of 12 mgim’ every week for an initial period 
of 6 consecutive weeks. After this period, patients with 
tumour response or disease stabilisation were allowed to 
continue treatment. 
Treatment was interrupted for one week in case of any 
proteinuria or other renal toxicity, grade 3 haematological 
toxicity or any other grade 2 non-haematological toxicity. If 
the toxicity persisted for more than one week without treat- 
ment, patients went off protocol. 
No preventive anti-emetic treatment was given during the 
first administration, thereafter it was left to the investigator 
to select a particular regimen if needed. 
Response and toxicity evaluation 
Follow-up studies included weekly complete blood 
counts, serum creatinine and urine analysis. Every 3 weeks, 
a complete clinical evaluation and full biochemistry analysis 
was also carried out. Tumour evaluation occurred every 6 
weeks. 
The objectives of the studies were response and toxicity 
evaluation in patients with advanced breast, colorectal, pan- 
creatic and gastric cancer. Standard WHO response criteria 
were used. Toxicities were graded according to the NC1 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Cancer clinical trials. 
RESULTS 
Patients’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. 
Gastric cancer 
20 eligible patients with advanced untreated gastric cancer 
were entered in the study. All patients were eligible. A total 
of 132 courses was administered. 3 patients were not evalu- 
able for response. 2 due to persistent proteinuria and 1 
patient received only 2 courses because of rapid progression

Colorectal cancer 
26 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were entered 
in the study. 1 patient did not start therapy. 6 patients had 
been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, completed more 
than 1 year prior to disease progression. The remaining 25 
patients received in total 175 drug administrations without 
dose modifications, but with delay in 17 instances. These 
delays were drug-related in 13 instances and all due to pro- 
teinuria. 3 patients were not evaluable for response-l 
stopped because of proteinuria, and 2 others only received 2 
courses because of progressive disease. In the 22 patients 
evaluable, no responses were observed. 6 patients had stable 
disease. 
Pancreatic cancer 
24 patients with untreated advanced pancreatic cancer 
were entered. 1 patient was not eligible because of the lack 
of a measurable lesion and never started treatment. The 23 
remaining patients received 129 drug administrations. No 
dose reductions were needed but a delay in dosing occurred 
in 23 instances, mainly due to proteinuria. Of these 23 
patients, 4 were not evaluable for response. 1 patient died 
prior to evaluation and 3 received only one cycle. No anti- 
tumour activity was observed in any of the remaining 19 
patients. Stable disease was observed in 4 patients. 
Breast cancer 
22 patients with breast cancer resistant to one line of 
chemotherapy were entered in the study. All patients were 
eligible. A total of 120 courses was administered. 3 patients 
were not evaluable for response-l patient received only 
one course, a second one only two courses, and a third 
patient had persistent proteinuria and went off study. No 
antitumour effect was observed. 3 patients had stable dis- 
ease after six courses, while the other patients all pro- 
gressed. 
Toxicity 
In this phase II study, a total of 556 courses were ad- 
ministered to 90 patients. A summary of toxicity details is 
given in Table 2. All courses were evaluable for toxicity. 
Toxicity was generally mild. Nausea grade I and II were 
observed in 145/556 (26%) courses. Only two grade III 
toxicities were recorded. Vomiting was equally mild and 
mainly limited to grade I and II. In total, 13.3% of courses 
was accompanied with some degree of vomiting. Asthenia, mentioned during 149 courses (26.8%), was also limited to 
grade I and II. The most important toxicity was renal with 
proteinuria in 251 instances (45.1%). This was grade I for 
201 (36.2%) and grade II for 49 (11.3%) courses. Only one 
grade III proteinuria was recorded. 4 patients had inter- 
rupted treatment because of persistent proteinuria. 12 
patients had grade I renal toxicity with creatinine elevations. 
No haematological toxicity was observed in this group of 
patients. Oedema was seen in 17 courses. There was no 
apparent relationship between the occurrence of proteinuria 
and oedema, or the presence of some degree of creatinine 
elevation. 
In some institutes, patients with minimal proteinttria, 
detected with sensitive biochemical urine analysis, were 
included into the study. This minimal initial proteinuria did 
not affect the incidence or severity of treatment-related pro- 
teinuria, nor did it worsen the risk for renal function dis- 
turbances or for the development of oedema. 
DISCUSSION 
E09 is one of a series of new bioreductive alkylating 
agents selected for clinical testing. In preclinical models, the 
role of DT-diaphorase in activation of E09 is considered to 
be important for its cytotoxic activity under aerobic con- 
ditions [9]. Under hypoxic conditions, the importance of 
DT-diaphorase activation is less clear. Even against a cell 
line that lacks DT-diaphorase activity, hypoxic sensitisation 
both for mitomycin C and E09 is evident [lo, 111. These 
different modes of activation and the selective efficacy 
against solid tumour cell lines were reasons to select E09 
for clinical testing. 
A weekly dose of 12 mg/m2 was selected for our phase II 
trial, but this schedule showed no sign of antitumour ac- 
tivity. The patterns of toxicity previously described in the 
phase I study were confirmed. In total, 90 patients received 
556 drug administrations. Main toxicities were mild nausea 
and vomiting rarely in excess of grade II and easily control- 
lable with standard anti-emetic agents, such as metoclo- 
pramide or alizapride. No haematological toxicity was 
observed. The clinically most important toxicities were 
renal. In 14/556 courses, a moderate creatinine elevation, 
grade I or II, was observed, but this was always reversible. 
Moderate grade I or II oedema was observed on 17 oc- 
casions (3.0%). However, proteinuria was much more fre- 
quent. Grade I or II urinary protein loss was noticed in 
2511556 (45%) of courses. One case of grade III proteinuria 
was recorded. These toxicities are not dissimilar from those 
observed in the phase I study and confirm that the selected 
dose can be considered as the highest feasible dose. We 2022 L.Y. Dirix et al. 
could not demonstrate a relationship between the protei- 
nuria and the appearance of oedema. 
The lack of activity is disappointing and needs some com- 
ment. As stated, the toxicity analysis in this trial, confirmed 
that E09 was administered at an adequate dose. Further 
dose escalations with this weekly schedule are not possible. 
Therefore, one possible explanation for the lack of activity 
despite the promising in vitro data might be given by the 
recent data from Collard and associates [ 121. These investi- 
gators examined the relationship between DT-diaphorase 
activity and sensitivity to E09 in a panel of human and 
rodent tumours. In cell lines, a possible relationship 
between enzyme activity and the chemosensitivity of cell 
lines was confirmed. Once grown in nude mice DT-dia- 
phorase activity in most tumours fell significantly. It may 
well be that the tumours from the patients studied did not 
contain adequate DT-diaphorase levels. These data suggest 
a cautious approach when developing strategies of rational 
drug design based on enzyme activity of cell lines, even if 
those are of human origin. We conclude that E09 at this 
dose and schedule is not an active drug in the types of 
tumour studied.
