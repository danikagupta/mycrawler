Summary:   
Although the exact mechanism of this drug interaction is unknown, methylene blue inhibits the action of 
monoamine oxidase A - an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin in the brain. It is believed that when 
methylene blue is given to patients taking serotonergic psychiatric medications, high levels of serotonin can build up in the brain, causing toxicity.   See Table 1. Psychiatric medications with serotonergic activity.   
•In emergency situations  requiring life -threatening or urgent treatment with methylene blue (as described
above), the availability of alternative interventions should be considered and the benefit of methylene bluetreatment should be weighed against the risk of serotonin toxicity. If methylene blue must be administered to apatient receiving a serotonergic drug, the serotonergic drug must be immediately stopped, and the patient should
be closely monitored for emergent symptoms of CNS toxicity for two weeks (five weeks if fluoxetine [Prozac] was
taken), or until 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue, whichever comes first.
•In non -emergency situations when non-urgent treatment with methylene blue is contemplated and planned,
the serotonergic psychiatric medication should be stopped to allow its activity in the brain to dissipate. Most
serotonergic psychiatric drugs should be stopped at least 2 weeks in advance of methylene blue treatment.
Fluoxetine (Prozac), which has a longer half -life compared to similar drugs, should be stopped at least 5 weeks
in advance
•Possible signs/sym ptoms of Serotonin Syndrome: mental status changes, muscle twitching, excessive sweating,
shivering or shaking, diarrhea, ataxia, fever
•Treatment with the serotonergic psychiatric medication may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of
methylene blue
•Serotonergic psychiatric medications should not be started in a patient receiving methylene blue. Wait until 24
hours after the last dose of methylene blue before starting the antidepressant.
