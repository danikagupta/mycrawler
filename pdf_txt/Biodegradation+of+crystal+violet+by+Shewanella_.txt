Detoxiﬁcationabstract
A bacterial isolate, strain NTOU1, originally isolated from the cooling system in an oil reﬁnery could
decolorize and detoxify crystal violet under anaerobic conditions. The strain was characterized andidentiﬁed as a member of Shewanella decolorationis based on Gram staining, morphology characters,
biochemical tests, the 16S rRNA gene and the gyrase subunit beta gene ( gyrB). The optimum pH value
and temperature for decolorization of crystal violet by this strain under anaerobic conditions were pH8–9 and 30–40 /C176C, respectively. Formate (20 mM) was the best electron donor. Addition of ferric cit-
rate did not inhibit decolorization of crystal violet, the addition of thiosulfate, ferric oxide, or manga-
nese oxide slightly decreased decolorization, while addition of nitrite (20 mM) inhibited thedecolorization of crystal violet. By supplementing the medium with formate and ferric citrate and cul-
tivating it under optimum pH and temperature, this strain could remove crystal violet, at a concentra-
tion of 1500 mg l
/C01, at the rate of 298 mg l/C01h/C01(during decolorization the OD 600of the cell culture
increased from /C240.6 to /C241.2). GC/MS analysis of the degradation products of crystal violet detected the
presence of N,N0-bis(dimethylamino) benzophenone (Michler’s Ketone), [ N,N-dimethylaminophenyl]
[N-methylaminophenyl] benzophenone, N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, N,N-dimethylaminophenol,
and 4-methylaminophenol. These results suggest that crystal violet was biotransformed into N,N-
dimethylaminophenol and Michler’s Ketone prior to further degradation of these intermediates. This
paper proposes a probable pathway for the degradation of crystal violet by this Shewanella sp.
Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial tests showed that the process of decolorization also detoxify crystalviolet.

1. Introduction
Triphenylmethane dyes are one of the major groups of dyestuffs
used for textiles, printing, papermaking, leather, food, and the cos-
metics industry ( Gregory, 1993; Azmi et al., 1998 ). These dyes are
recalcitrant molecules and can be antimicrobial, toxic to mamma-
lian cells, and mutagenic ( Littleﬁeld et al., 1985; Banat et al., 1996;
Culp and Beland, 1996 ). Therefore, the decolorization of wastewa-
ters containing these dyes prior to discharge is mandatory by envi-
ronmental regulations in most countries.
Although several physicochemical methods, e.g. adsorption,
chemical precipitation and ﬂocculation, oxidation by chlorine,
hydrogen peroxide and ozone, electrolysis, reduction, electrochem-
ical treatment, and ion-pair extraction have been used to eliminate
the color from these wastewaters in the efﬂuent ( Reife, 1993; Azmi
et al., 1998 ), they are generally expensive or produce large
amounts of sludge. Therefore, these methods have only a limitedapplicability. As a result, the interest is focused on microbial bio-
degradation as a better alternative. However, triphenylmethane
dyes have complex aromatic molecular structures, and few bacte-
ria have been reported that have the ability to decolorize triphe-
nylmethane dyes ( Yatome et al., 1981, 1991, 1993; Kwasniewska,
1985; An et al., 2002 ). Although several white-rot fungi are known
to decolorize triphenylmethane dyes ( Bumpus and Brock, 1988;
Cha et al., 2001 ), in practice they are difﬁcult to apply as a waste-
water treatment of sewage containing dyes because of their difﬁ-
culty to survive and adapt in wastewater. Therefore, much work
remains to be done to isolate new bacteria that are applicable for
the biodegradation of triphenylmethane dyes.
Recently we isolated a facultative bacterium from a cooling sys-
tem of an oil reﬁnery. It was capable of anaerobic growth utilizing
a variety of electron acceptors including ferric citrate. Many pure
cultures of iron-reducing bacteria can oxidize a variety of aromatic
contaminants such as benzene and naphthalene ( Beliaev and
Saffarini, 1998 ). Therefore, in this study, 16S rRNA and gyrB gene
analysis were used to investigate the phylogenetic placement
of this isolate. The potential of this isolate to degrade and to
detoxify crystal violet, and its degradation pathways were also
investigated.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Crystal violet, with around 85% dye content, purchased from
Sigma–Aldrich was used without further puriﬁcation. The chemi-
cals N,N0-bis(dimethylamino) benzophenone (Michler’s Ketone)
and N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde were obtained from Acros
Organic Co. (New Jersey, NJ). All other chemicals were of reagent
grade.
2.2. Organism
Strain NTOU1 is a bacterium that was originally isolated from a
cooling system in an oil reﬁnery. The strain is Gram stain-negative,
rod-shaped, pink to orange-pigmented and motile with a single po-
lar ﬂagellum. This strain can grow under both of anaerobic and aer-
obic conditions. It was not able to ferment glucose, but it was
capable of anaerobic growth utilizing a variety of electron accep-
tors, including Fe(III), Mn(IV), iron oxide, sulfate, sulﬁte, thiosul-
fate, nitrate, nitrite, arsenate, selenate, and selenite. Lactate,
pyruvate, formate and H 2were used as carbon and energy sources.
This strain has been deposited in the Bioresource Collection and
Research Center in Taiwan as BCRC 910321 and in the Japan IAM
Culture Collection as JCM 14211.
2.3. Sequence analysis of the16S rRNA gene and the gyrB gene
To further identify this strain, DNA from 50 ml bacterial culture
was isolated and puriﬁed on hydroxyapatite as described by
Cashion et al. (1977) . Then 16S rRNA and gyrB gene were ampliﬁed
by using the polymerase chain reaction method. For ampliﬁcation
of 16S rRNA, two universal primers 8F and 1492R were used ( Eden
et al., 1991 ). For the ampliﬁcation of amplicons of 1.2 kbp from the
gyrB gene (covering positions 274–1525; Escherichia coli number-
ing), two universal primer sets were used ( Yamamoto and Haray-
ama, 1995 ). The sequences ampliﬁed from this strain were
compared with those in the GenBank nucleotide database by using
online basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) searches. Phyloge-
netic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method
and nucleotide substitution rates ( Knucvalues), computed by Kim-
ura’s 2-parameter model.
2.4. Media and culture conditions
Luria–Bertani medium (LB medium) ( Sambrook et al., 1989 )
was used for aerobic cultivation at 30 /C176C. When cultivating under
anaerobic conditions, the strain was inoculated into 50 ml or
100 ml serum bottles containing sodium formate (20 mM) and fer-
ric citrate (20 mM) supplemented phosphate-buffered basal med-
ium under an atmosphere of N 2at 30 /C176C. The phosphate-buffered
basal medium ( Saltikov et al., 2003 ) contains (g l/C01of deionized
water unless otherwise indicated): K 2HPO 4, 0.225; KH 2PO4,
0.225; NaCl, 0.46; (NH 4)2SO4, 0.225; MgSO 4/C17H2O, 0.117; trace
element solution ( Skerratt et al., 2002 ), 1 ml; and vitamin solution
(Widdel and Bak, 1992 ), 1 ml. These serum bottles were capped
with butyl rubber stoppers and were aluminum crimp sealed. A
modiﬁed Hungate technique was used throughout the study for
anaerobic cultivation ( Ljungdahl and Wiegel, 1986 ).
2.5. Decolorization of crystal violet under different growth conditions
At ﬁrst, decolorization of crystal violet (50 mg l/C01) by strain
NTOU1 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 30 /C176C were
tested. LB medium was used for cultivation under aerobic condi-tions, while formate and ferric citrate supplemented phosphate-
buffered basal medium was used for cultivation under anaerobic
conditions.
Since growth of this strain was much faster under aerobic con-
ditions (data not shown), cells collected from growth under aerobic
conditions were collected and used for decolorization tests under
anaerobic conditions. Thus, strain NTOU1 was ﬁrst cultivated un-
der aerobic conditions at 30 /C176C overnight in LB medium and then
harvested by centrifugation (8000 g, 10 min). The pellet was
washed twice in 10 ml phosphate-buffered basal medium (pH
7.0) and then re-suspended in 10 ml phosphate-buffered basal
medium under a gas stream of N 2. Cell suspension was transferred
to duplicate 50 ml serum bottles containing fresh anaerobic med-
ium (20 ml) supplemented with a dye (50–1500 mg l/C01) to reach
an initial cell mass of 0.4–0.5 g l/C01(wet weight) and incubated
statically under anaerobic conditions at 30 /C176C for the dye-decolor-
ization test. Decolorization tests with heat killed cell suspension or
without cell suspension served as controls. At varies time points
(every 1–2 h) during incubation, 1 ml of subsample was taken
and centrifuged. The concentration of the dye in the supernatant
was determined by monitoring the absorbance at the absorption
maximum ( kmax) of 585 nm. Decolorization activity (%) was calcu-
lated according to the formula decolorization activity = ( A/C0B)/
A/C2100, in which Ais the initial absorbance and Bis the observed
absorbance. To ensure that the pH changes in the dye solution had
no inﬂuence on decolorization, the visible absorption spectrum
was determined between pH 5.0 and 10.0, and it was found that
the pH at that range did not affect the spectrum. Decolorization
activity (%) was expressed as the average of the duplicate tubes.
2.6. Effect of different electron donors, electron acceptors, pH,
temperature and concentration on decolorization of crystal violet
Effect of different electron donors, electron acceptors, pH, tem-
perature and concentration on decolorization of crystal violet was
tested sequentially. In order to ﬁnd the optimum conditions to
decolorize crystal violet, after the better substituent or condition
was found in one step, it will be included or used in the next step.
When testing the effects of different electron donors on decolor-
ization of crystal violet (50 mg l/C01), H 2(CO 2:H2= 4:1, v/v), lactate,
formate, pyruvate, arabinose, acetate or butyrate (20 mM) was
added to the culture medium containing ferric citrate (20 mM) as
the electron acceptor. While testing the effects of different electron
acceptors on decolorization, ferric citrate, thiosulfate, nitrite, ferric
oxide, iron oxide, or manganese oxide (20 mM) was added to the
medium containing formate (20 mM) as the electron donor. When
testing the pH range for decolorization, separate batches of medium
adjusted to 5–10 with 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH were used. When test-ing the temperature range for decolorization, separate batches of
medium were incubated at 15–40 /C176C. When testing the effect of
dye concentration on decolorization, separate batches of medium
containing 100–1500 mg l
/C01of crystal violet were used. Each
experiment was performed in duplicate. Decolorization activity
(%) was expressed as the average of the duplicate tubes.
2.7. Determination of decolorization and transformation products of
crystal violet
Aliquots of cell cultures (50 ml) collected at intervals during and
after decolorization of crystal violet (100 mg l/C01) from a serum bot-
tle containing 800 ml cell culture, were used to study the degrada-
tion products of crystal violet. Cell culture (50 ml) was centrifuged
at 8000 gfor 10 min, and the supernatant collected was extracted
with 100 ml of ethylacetate. The extract was condensed by rotary
evaporators at 60 /C176C. The extract was then dissolved in 1 ml of
ethylacetate and passed through a column containing anhydrousC.-H. Chen et al. / Chemosphere 72 (2008) 1712–1720 1713Download English Version:
