Abstract:  The use of peanut and pistachio shells  as an adsorbent for the removal of Brillant Blue and K -RED 
198, Methylene Oran ge, and Methylene Blue  was investigated. The commonly used isotherm models were 
applied for data obtained from further batch studies . Dye removal capacity is  as follows 65%  for Brillant Blue , 
73 % for KRED 198.  Methylene Orange and Methylene Blue were removed poorly for peanut and pistachio 
shell. Freundlich isotherm model were found to be the best fitted one and based on Freundlich isotherm model 
adsorption capacities were 4.58 mg/g for Brillant Blue  and 4. 33 mg/g for K -RED 198 at peanut shells  and 4.04 
mg/g for Brillant Blue  and 4. 64 mg/g for K -RED 198 at pistachio shells . Kinetic examinations were also carried 
out for  two dyes tested and it was found that adsorption kinetic was best described by pseudo first-order kinetic 
model.

INTRODUCTION  
Dyestuffs, chemical s and water are mostly used textile, plastic, leather and cosmetic industry.  
Textile is the main industry using these components  and producing large quantity of coloured 
wastewater [1]. Approximately 100 tones dyes are discharged in rivers and lake without purification  
and that result in carcinogenic and toxic effect on human life and aquatic life [2]. Some of dye resits for 
chemic al degradation in aquatic solution due to their steady -state structures  [3]. Dye is very visible 
even at very low residuals in receiving body. It is crucial to reduce the res idual concentration limits  [4].    
Some purification methods such as biological, oxidation, electrochemical, photochemical 
degradation and adsorption, coagulation/flocculation, ion exchange have been describe for removal of 
residual from aquatic solution [5-7]. Dye structures  and concentrat ion is very important to selection of 
removal methods [8]. Most of them are expensive and require high- technology [9]. However, adsorption 
process is technical alternative of removal the dye from wastewater due to easy design and operation, 
cost-efficient  [10]. Economic, renewable and locally available agricultural residues such as , pine cone, 
grapefruit peel, canola hull, peanut hull, princess tree leaf, pistachio shells and red pine sawdust, 
soybean hulls, rice husk [11-14], are widely used for dye removal from aqueous solution as an adsorbent.  
In this study, the adsorption capacity of peanut and pistachio shells  was evaluated to remove dyes 
from water and also effects of pH, adsorbent dosage and contact time on the adsorption were 
investigated. The commonly used isotherm models were applied for data obtained from further batch 
studies.  
MATERIAL AND METHOD  
 
Materials 
Brillant Blue and K -RED 198, Methylene orange, and Methylene Blue were chosen as a dyestuff 
to removal of wastewater. The deionised water was used for preparation of dye stock solution of 25  
g/L. The pH value of the working solutions was adjusted to the desired values by using 0.1 M HCl or 
0.1 M NaOH. All chemicals used in the present work were produced by Merck with Analytical 
Reagent grade. Table 1 shows the feature of the dyestuffs.

Table 1 .The feature of the dyestuffs  
 
Peanut and pistachio shells  were taken from dried nut factories an Osmaniye and Gaziantep city. 
The shells was cleaned by using deionize water and then dried out  in oven at 80  oC.  Finally, Peanut 
and pistachio shells was grinded by 0.5 -1.2 mm and  1- 1.7 mm intervals respectively.   
 
Analytical Methods  
All analyses were carried out by following American Public Health Association standard methods  
[15], unless mentioned otherwise. The chemicals were analytical grade ( > 99%), as they were purchased 
from Merck GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany). pH was measured by using apparatuses with the relevant 
probes ( LabQuest2/  Vernier, USA). Residual dyestuff concentrations were determined by the help of 
spectrophotometer (UV/vis spectrophotometer (T80+ Pg Ins. Ltd.).  
 
Batch studies  
The batch studies were carried out at 20 ◦C in conical flasks (1000 mL) with an orbital shaker in a 
constant room temperature. Stock, 25 g/L, dyes concentration was used and the selected incubation 
time of the flasks was ranged from 5 to 45 min. Several mL  of aqueous solution was taken at different 
time intervals. The data to derive the isotherms and kinetic models constants were obtained by using a known amount of the shells and 100 mL aqueous solution containing dyestuff and at fixed pH values. 
The equati on 1 was used to calculate the adsorption capacity, q (mg.g
-1).

RESEARCH FINDINGS  
 Effect of pH  
The sorption capacity is conducted by the pH due to pH effect s on adsorbent surface and dyestuff 
ionization in the aquatic solution 
[16,17]. The effects of pH on dyestuff at 250 mL, 25 mg/L of dyestuff, 
and 4 g/L of adsorbent were analysed and the variety of pH values ranged between 3 and 8 are given 
in Fig. 1 and Fig 2. As seen figures, i ncrease in pH values resulted slight increase in removal 
efficiency and this increase was negligible. On the contrary, some rechargers reported that acidic pH 
gave better adsorption results by using biomass adsorbent to remove reactive dyes from wastewater  
[18]. Maximum dye removal efficiency was obtained at neutral pH values both peanut and pistachio 
shells. Therefore, op timum pH value was chosen as 7.0 and the further studies carried out with neutral 
pH to get maximum colour removal rate during batch sorption tests.  Materials  Formula  Molecular weight  λ max (nm)

Effect of adsorption dosage and contact time  
Adsorption dosage is an important factor for the determination of an adsorbent capacity. Figure 3 
(pistachio data is not given) shows effect of p eanut  shells dose on removal of the dyes. The adsorbent 
dosages were varied between 2.0 g and 8.0 g at fixed pH and temperature of 20◦C. As seen in Fig. 3, 
dye adsorption rate increased with increasin g the shells until 6 g. This can be explained by the fact that 
increase in adsorbent dosage provide higher adsorption capacity that resulted in more surface area 
available for dye ions will be exposed to more active sites for binding  [11]. Optimum adsorbent dosage 
was determined as 6.0 g for peanut shells (see Fig. 3). The same figure continued for pistachio shells 
(data not given).  
The contact time for dyes and adsorbents is also importance for the removal process. Contact time 
experiment helps to realize in the quantity of the dye adsorbed in different times. The equilibrium time  
is also one of the most important design parameters for adsorption proses. As seen Fig. 4, adsorption–
desorption occurred on the shell  in process of time for Methyl  Orange and Methylene Blue . K-RED 
198 and Brillant Blue were fast for the first time and then they gradually decreased in time until they 
reach equilibrium. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the most of the dye were removed in the f irst 45 min. 020406080

 The contact time of 45 min was, therefore, selected and applied to the equilibrium experiments.  The 
present study results are in line with Mook et al. [19] search including RB5 removal from wastewater by 
using palm shell.

Adsorption isotherms  
The equilibrium isotherm is key element to understand the interaction between a sorbate and an 
adsorbent. The data was applied to commonly used isotherm models; Freundlich  and Langmuir. Dye 
removal efficiency for peanut and pistachio shells is as follows; 73. 1% for K -RED 198 and 64.9% for 
Brilliant Blue, 73.6% for K -RED 198 and 65.84% for Brillia nt Blue, respectively. The best fit 
isotherm was obtained by Freundlich model compared with the Langmuir model. The Freundlich 
isotherm is described as the multilayer adsorption of adsorbate on a heterogeneous adsorbent surface  
[17,20]. The isotherm model parameters are given in Table 2.  
The adsorption process is acceptable when the n ranges between 1 and 10. If n is bigger than 1, 
chemical adsorption process occurs; n of n is lower than 1, the physical adsorption happen [1]. The 
value of n for both dye were found bigger than 1 and (see Table 2 ). These presented that chemical 
adsorption occurred for the removal of dyestuffs. Furthermore, high and favourable sorption occurred 01020304050607080

Adsorption kinetic  
The adsorption with natural materials is a complex process due to the heterogeneity of adsorbent 
surface. Adsorption rate on the solid –liquid interface is affected by the residence time [21]. Dye 
adsorption on adsorbent from aqueous solution includes several stage such as transport in the solution, 
external diffusion or boundary layer diffusion, internal diffusion or intraparticle diffusion, adsorption 
or desorption on the surface of the interi or sites [1]. The data was applied to commonly use  kinetic 
models; Evolvich, Fractional Powder and Pseudo First -Order. The kinetic model parameters are 
presented in Table 3.  
Chemical reaction, mass transfer and diffusion control for adsorption process is explained by 
kinetic analysis. The pseudo kinetics model assumes that chemisorption of the adsorbate occurs on adsorbent. It was found that pseudo first -order kinetic model describes the shells adsorption well for 
all used dyestuffs.  The removal of dyestuf fs by the shells is complex and includes more than one 
mechanism. Previous adsorption research with respect to dyes with various organic adsorbent such as 
date stones and palm -tress waste 
[6] , princess tree leaf [14], pine cone  [11] demonstrated that dye removal 
followed pseudo second- order kinetic model. The findings of the present studies are  in line with 
previous research.

 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION 
The results of the study indicated that peanut and pistachio shells can be used as a practical, 
effective and low cost- efficient alternative sorbent for the removal of dyestuff. Initial adsorption 
studies show that Methylene  Orange  and Methylen e Blue were removed poorly, however Brillant Blue 
and K -RED 198 bound to the shells. Experiment data fitted well to Freundlich isotherm model. The 
maximum adsorption capacities based on this model were as follows:  4.58 mg/g for Brillant Blue , and 
4.33 mg/g for K-RED 198 at peanut shells, and 4.04 mg/g for Brillant Blue , and 4.64 mg/g for K-RED 
198 at pistachio shells. The sorption of dyestuffs onto the shells  was described well by pseudo first -
order kinetic model.  Int. J. of Environmental Pollution & Environmental Modelling, Vol. 2(5): 270 -276 (2019 )
