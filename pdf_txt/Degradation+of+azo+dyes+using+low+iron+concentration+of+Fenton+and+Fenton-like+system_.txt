Abstract The main objective of this work was to study the
degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) dye in aqueous
solution by hydrogen peroxide using HFe 2.5P2W18O62
23.H 2O as a catalyst. HFe 2.5P2W18O6223.H 2O is a recy-
clable DAWSON-type heteropolyanion. Effects of various
experimental parameters of the oxidation reaction of the
dye were investigated. The studied parameters were the
initial pH, the initial H 2O2concentration, the catalyst mass,
and the dye concentration. The optimum conditions had
been determined, and it was found that efﬁciency of
degradation obtained was about 100%. The optimal
parameters were: initial pH 4; [H 2O2]0=2 mM; catalyst
mass 0.01 g; concentration of dye 30 mg/L. Infrared
spectroscopy analysis of the HFe 2.5P2W18O6223.H 2O cat-
alyst indicates that the catalyst showed good stability for
degradation of AO7 even after second cycle.

Introduction
The treatment of textile waste waters has always been a
serious problem for these industries. These components
sometimes are not biodegradable and are toxic enough for
aquatic ecosystems [ 1]. Some classical methods such as
adsorption on activated carbon, ozonation, reverse osmosis,ion exchange on synthetic adsorbent resins, ﬂocculation,
and decantation are available for removing dye from water.
However, these methods have high operating cost [ 2] or are
inefﬁcient due to complex aromatic structure. Other alter-
natives to degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants are now
being studied including advanced oxidation (AOPs) whose
characteristic is to generate hydroxyl radicals (/C1OH), which
are powerful oxidants [ 3].
These radicals are generated by Fenton’s reagent (Fe2?/
H2O2), which has been the subject of many studies in the
degradation of organic matter [ 4]. However, the disadvan-
tage of the method lies in Fenton rejection of a signiﬁcant
amount of sludge Fe2?and Fe3?[5], which requires sepa-
ration or removal, thus increasing the operational cost. To
solve this problem, many studies have focused on the use of a
modiﬁed Fenton process (Fenton-Like) to treat waste waters.
A method which relies on the use iron incorporated in the
recyclable compounds [ 6]. In this work, a new homogeneous
Fenton-like system based on hydrogen peroxide and a
recyclable Dawson-type heteropolyanion (Fig. 1)[7].
(HFe 2.5P2W18O6223.H 2O/H 2O2) system was used for
decolorization of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) (also known as
Orange II).
Acid Orange 7 is one of the dyes that are produced in
large amounts in the world. It is commonly used in phar-
maceutical, food, and cosmetics industries. Acid Orange 7
is an azoique dye used in dyeing of silk and wool. For these
qualities, Acid Orange 7 is much used in the textile
industry. The molecular structure of azo-dye Orange II is
shown in Fig. 2. Acid Orange 7 is not amenable to con-
ventional biological treatment [ 8].
The aim of the study is to examine the inﬂuence of
different parameters such as the solution pH, the catalyst
mass, the concentration of H 2O2,and the initial dye con-
centration on the degradation of Acid Orange 7 by H 2O2&Ouahiba Bechiri

Experimental section
Synthesis of catalyst HFe 2.5P2W18O6223.H 2O[9]
HFe 2.5P2W18O6223.H 2O
5 g (1.088 mol) of H 6P2W18O62was dissolved in 20 mL of
water at room temperature and 0.767 g of solid FeCl 2,6-
H2O (3.26 mol) was then added. The mixture was then
stirred for 10 min. Yellow powder was obtained after ﬁvedays by slow evaporation.
H
6P2W18O62was prepared, starting from the substance
mother (K 6P2W18O62,n H 2O)6-,by extraction with ether in
hydrochloric acid medium according to the methods
described in the literature [ 10].
Behavior of AO7 oxidation using HFe 2.5P2W18O62
23.H 2O/H 2O2system
Reagents
The 4-(2-hydroxy-1-naphthylazo) benzene sulfonic acid
sodium salt, commonly named orange II or Acid Orange 7(AO7) (90%) was obtained from Aldrich (H 2O235%,
W/W) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company.
All other reagents (NaOH or H 2SO4) that used in this study
were analytical grade.
Procedures and analysis
The experiments were performed in a reactor batch of
500 mL capacity. Various solutions of AO7 were prepared
at different concentrations. They were then homogenized
by stirring them until the dye is completely dissoluted of
the dye. pH was adjusted using 0.1 N H 2SO4or NaOH
aqueous solutions. In all experiments 100 mL of dyes
(30 mg/L) solution containing the appropriate quantity of
catalyst and H 2O2was magnetically stirred at room tem-
perature. The AO7 decreasing concentration of dye was
monitored by a 6705 UV visible spectrophotometer JEN-
WAY. The Wave length corresponding to the maximumabsorbance is given below: k
max=486 nm [ 11].
The resolution of the wave length and bandwidth was 1
and 0.5 nm. The cell used during the experiments wasmade of 1 cm thick quartz.
Effects of operational parameters on AO7 oxidationThe oxidation of AO7 by H
2O2using (HFe 2.5P2W18O61
23H 2O) as a catalyst has been studied according to the
following factors: initial pH of the solution, H 2O2con-
centration, mass of the catalyst (HFe 2.5P2W18O6123H 2O),
and dye concentration.
The oxidation efﬁciency (discoloration) was determined
as it is shown below [ 12]:
DE¼Ci/C0Cf/C0/C1
=Ci/C2/C3
/C2100 ð1Þ
DE: discoloration efﬁciency; Ci: Initial dye concentration;
Cf: ﬁnal dye concentration.
Effect of solution pH The pH value of dye solution has
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the catalytic system efﬁciency
because: (1) it can affect the catalyst stability and (2) it
inﬂuences the catalytic reaction which controls the pro-duction rate of hydroxyl radicals [ 13]. To ﬁnd the optimum
pH for the decolorization of AO7, a series of experiments
at initial pH value in the range 3–8 was conducted.
Figure 3illustrates the effect of pH on the discoloration
efﬁciency of AO7 in water. It was found that the discol-
oration efﬁciency of AO7 is strongly pH dependent. Theoptimal pH is about 4 giving discoloration efﬁciency equal
to 94.25%. This result can be explained by the stability of
the catalyst at this pH. Also, H
2O2molecules are unsta-
ble in alkaline solution and therefore, the degradation of
dye decreases in alkaline solution [ 14].
The optimal value is chosen pH 4.

123Effect of the nature of the acid used to adjust the pH The
oxidation of the dye by the Fenton-like process can beinﬂuenced by the presence of various ions such as SO
42-,
NO3-,C l-, and PO 43-[15]. To evaluate the inﬂuence of
these anions, we adjusted the pH of an aqueous solution ofAO7 by different acids H
2SO4, HNO 3, HCl, and H 3PO4in
similar operating conditions to those previously
established.
Figure 4shows the effect of these acid ions (chloride,
sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate) on the dye oxidation. It
appears that the presence of phosphate ions inhibits theoxidation of the dye using HFe
2.5P2W18O6223.H 2O/H 2O2
system.
Sulfate and nitrate ions have virtually no effect on the
discoloration of AO7. However, depending on the nature of
the acids, the discoloration efﬁciency is about 94.25, 94.35,
96.09, and 03.06% in the presence of H 2SO4,H N O 3, HCl,and H 3PO4acids, respectively. These results agree with
those found at the degradation of other organic pollutants
[16]. We can deduce that H 2SO4, HNO 3,and HCl acids
lead almost to the same efﬁciency, but in the presence ofH
3PO4it is too low. The inhibitory effect of phosphate ions
may be due to the trapping of/C1OH radicals.
Effect of catalyst mass The effect of the catalyst mass
was investigated, keeping operational parameters identical
to those of the above-mentioned experiment. The following
catalyst quantities have been used: 0.005; 0.008; 0.01;
0.02 g. The results are illustrated in Fig. 5.
These results show that the discoloration efﬁciency of
AO7 oxidation increases when increasing the catalytic
mass up to 0.01 g where the decolorization efﬁciency is
optimal. Beyond this value, there is a decrease of the dis-coloration efﬁciency. The excess of the catalyst does not
appear to ply a positive role in the AO7 oxidation using
HFe
2.5P2W18O6223.H 2O/H 2O2system. This result is in
good agreement with literature [ 12,13,17]: the decrease of
the discoloration efﬁciency of AO7 when increasing the
mass of the catalyst can be explained by the presence ofside reaction consuming the radicals hydroxyls. The mass
of catalyst that gives the best result is 0.01 g.
Effect of H
2O2concentration The effect of H 2O2con-
centration on AO7 decolorization was studied in the range
0.04–0.44 mmol. The results are illustrated in Fig. 6.
The results indicate that the degradation of AO7 was
increased by increasing the concentration of H 2O2up to a
value of concentration of H 2O2equal to 2 mM.
Decolorization of certain dyes, mainly azo, with acti-
vated hydrogen peroxide in homogeneous systems, using
different soluble catalysts (heteropolyanions) was already
studied [ 18].020406080100

123The activation of hydrogen peroxide by homogeneous
catalysts was attributed to the formation of highly active
hydroxyl radicals [ 19]. High concentrated H 2O2solution
undergoes self quenching of OH radicals, with formation ofhydroperoxyl radicals HO
2. Although HO 2is an effective
oxidant itself, its oxidation potential is much lower than
that of/C1OH radicals [ 20].

It can be postulated that H 2O2should be added at an
optimum concentration to achieve the best degradation.
Hence, 0.2 mM/L of H 2O2appears as an optimal.
Radical scavenging experiments and possible reaction
mechanism In general,/C1OH radicals are known as a key
active species in the catalytic oxidation process./C1OH rad-
icals are powerful oxidants for many organic molecules.
Ethanol, methanol, and 2-propanol are known as OH
scavengers [ 21–24]. These reagents were introduced into
the reaction system to capture/C1OH in the oxidation of AO7
process. The results are illustrated in Fig. 7.
These results show that the addition of/C1OH scavenger
reagents causes a sharp decrease in the degradation ofAO7, and the discoloration efﬁciency of AO7 from 100%
to 1.6, 2.08, and 2.53% in the presence of methanol,
ethanol, and 2-propanol, respectively. According to theabove discussion, it is furthermore conﬁrmed that the
degradation of AO7 molecules is dependent on the avail-
ability of
/C1OH radical species./C1OH radicals make a major
contribution to degradation of AO7. OH scavenger
reagents added consume/C1OH radical species and less willbe available for the degradation of the dye molecules,
hence the lower discoloration efﬁciency.
Also, it was shown [ 25] that the action of H 2O2on a
complex containing Fe3?resulted in the reduction of Fe3?
to Fe2?with apparition of HO /C12.
The action of H 2O2on the complex of Fe2?leads to the
generation of hydroxyl radicals OH /C1. These hydroxyl rad-
icals cause the degradation of the dye.
In agreement with the results found and the mechanism
proposed below, we can propose the following mechanism:
P2W18Fe3þþH2O2!P2W18Fe2þþHO:
2þHþ;ð5Þ
P2W18Fe2þþH2O2!P2W18Fe3þþ2:OH : ð6Þ
The degradation of AO7 by H 2O2catalyzed with
HFe 2.5P2W18O6223.H 2O heteropolyanion can be well
supported by the change in the UV–Vis absorption
spectrum over the course of degradation (Fig. 8). The
AO7 spectrum was characterized by the chromophore thatcontained azo linkage [ 26] in the visible range at 484 and
430 nm corresponding to the hydrazone and azo form. In
the ultraviolet region, the absorbance peaks at 230 and
310 nm are due to the benzene and naphthalene rings,
respectively. These four characteristic bands were mark-edly weakened during the degradation reaction, tending to
disappear completely after 60 min, without the appear-
ance of new absorption bands in the visible or ultravioletregions due to destruction of the chromophoric and aux-
ochromic structures by the homogeneous Fenton-like
reaction.
Effect of the AO7 concentration It is important from an
application point of view to study the dependence of
removal efﬁciency on the initial concentration of the col-orant (AO7).
To determine the effect of AO7 concentration on dis-
coloration efﬁciency, a series of experiments was realized020406080100

123between 5 and 50 mg/L. The variation of the discoloration
efﬁciency of the AO7 dye with H 2O2and HFe 2.5P2W18O61
23H 2O catalyst as a function of initial dye concentration is
represented in Fig. 9. The results show that the discol-
oration efﬁciency increases with increasing of dye con-
centration up to a value equal to 30 mg/L, but above it the
discoloration efﬁciency decreases.
This result can be explained as follows:
At low concentration of dye, the discoloration efﬁciency
is lower (ED 39% for the concentration of AO7 5 mg/L).These results concur with those found in literature [ 27–29].
This phenomenon can be explained by the effect of H
2O2
concentration is in excess compared to latter and can cause
the scavenging effect (the reaction of H 2O2and OH/C1in
aqueous solution).
– At higher concentration of dye, the discoloration
efﬁciency decreases (ED 48% for the concentration of
AO7 50 mg/L). This phenomenon can be explained bythe fact that increasing the initial concentration of dye
leads to an increase in the number of molecules of
(AO7), while the number of the radical’s hydroxylsremains constant (H
2O2concentration and catalyst keptconstant), thereby causing a decrease in the discol-
oration efﬁciency [ 19,27].
Stability and recycling of the catalyst
After reaction, we have tried to recover the catalyst
P2W18Fe3?. The method used is its precipitation, as
potassium salt, by adding a mass of KCl in the solutionafter complete discoloration in a basic medium. The
resulting precipitate was characterized by infrared spec-
troscopy. The spectra are illustrated in Fig. 10.
The spectrum of the recovered heteropolyanion is
identical to that of the initially added heteropolyanion. We
can therefore conclude that the catalyst remains stable androbust after the reaction.
Figure 11shows the catalytic performance of recovered
catalyst after four cycles through the oxidation of AO7 dye,by hydrogen peroxide.
After second cycle, the catalyst did not exhibit signiﬁ-
cant loss of catalytic activity and the discoloration efﬁ-ciency was 100. AO7 degradation decreases only from 100

123to 95% in three cycles. In four cycles, AO7 degradation
decreases from 100 to 89%.
This result is in good agreement with the literature [ 28].
The loss of activity can be explained by to poisoning of theactive catalytic sites due to adsorbed organic species.
However, this could be avoided by placing the catalyst in
an oven at 180 /C176C, to enhance the organic solvent.
Conclusion
Fe(III)-phosphotunstate/H 2O2system is a new homoge-
neous Fenton-like system that is capable of oxidizingorganic dye compounds. The experimental results show
that the initial pH, the initial concentration of H
2O2,
Fe(III)P 2W18, AO7 concentration, had a great inﬂuence on
the degradation of AO7 dye. It is approximately 100% dye
which has been eliminated the Fe(III)P 2W18/H2O2on the
following operating conditions: pH 4, catalyst mass 0.01 g,[H
2O2]0=2 m M. The molar ratio H 2O2/AO 7=0.02.
The possibility of recovery of the catalyst after reaction is
veriﬁed by adding a mass of KCl in the solution aftercomplete discoloration. The stability of reused catalyst is
conﬁrmed after second cycle.
This system constitutes simple and effective method
compared to those previously reported for the oxidation of
Acid Orange 7 [ 29,30].
