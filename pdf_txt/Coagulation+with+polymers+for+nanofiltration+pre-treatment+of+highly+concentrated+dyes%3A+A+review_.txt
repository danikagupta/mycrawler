Abstract  19 
The performance of several chemical coagulants including  ferric chloride, calcium lactate, 20 
magnesium hydroxide, aluminium  chlorohydrate, and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride  21 
(polyDADMAC ) were investigated in removing colour of palm oil mill biogas plant 22 
wastewater ( POMBPW ). The result s show  that f erric chloride as a sole coagulant can achieve  23 
high colour removal of more than 80%  without needed for pH adjustment , which indicates  the 24 
effectiveness of the coagulant to treat palm oil mill biogas plant wastewater 25 2 
 (POMBPW ).However, d ual coagulants i.e. ferric chloride -anionic polyacrylamide ( APAM ) 1 
shows better performance than ferric chloride -polyDADMAC in terms of colour  removal, pH, 2 
with shorter sedimentation time . The addition of polymer to system not only reduc es the ferric 3 
chloride dosage , but also increase s the colour removal of more than 20%. Comparison 4 
between APAM and polyDADMAC as flocculant aids shows  that APAM can achieve stable 5 
removal at wider pH range and lowest  sedimentation time at 20 minutes while polyDADMAC 6 
was at one hour. Both dual coagulants were followed second order kinetic and APAM shows 7 
the highest rate over polyDADMAC i.e. 3×10-5/PtCo.min and 2×10-5/PtCo.min  respectively.  8 
Addition of polymers reduced  phytotoxicity  of generated sludge and the sludge has potential 9 
to be reused for land application.   10

1. Introduction  15 
Most of palm oil mills have to deal with their highly polluting wastewater that is known as 16 
palm oil mill effluent (POME) . This has led to the emergence of a new treatment technology  17 
with environmental friendly approach. Palm oil mill has adopted anaerobic digestion system 18 
technology known as biogas plant  where it can convert the organic carbon i.e. chemical 19 
oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) to biogas with the help of  20 
anaerobic bacteria. This renewable energy generated from this plant can be used to generate 21 
electricity and can save tones  of fossil fuel.  However, the performance of biogas plant is 22 
primarily depending on the bacteria that readily exist in the wastewater . This bacteria  can be 23 3 
 sensitive to their environment, namely pH and temperature. It has been  reported that biogas 1 
plant can remove up to 80% of COD from the POME after being anaerobically digested 2 
(Tong and Jaafar, 2006 ).Nevertheless, the treated wastewater from this p lant has high level of 3 
polluting contents, which do not comply with the discharge requirement limit set by 4 
Department of Environment (DOE). Moreover, the wastewater colour turned from brownish 5 
(POME) to blackish after POME was digested. This colour  transformation might be due to 6 
Maillard reaction of natural condensation between carbonyl groups and free amino groups  in 7 
POME that  produce melanoidin, which is  an anaerobic fermentation by product (Yaser et al., 8 
2013 ). As a result, this highly coloured wastewater can create aesthetic problem and affect the 9 
photosynthesis activity by reducing the sunlight penetration if it is discharged into the 10 
watercourse (Neoh et al., 2013 , Grainger et al., 2010 , VukoviĆ et al., 2008 , Mohan and 11 
Karthikeyan, 1997 ). Bunrung et al. (2014 and 2011) have studied the decolourisation of palm 12 
oil mill biogas plant wastewater ( POMBPW ) by using physical method and also combined 13 
with biological method. They found out that the decolourisation  of more than 80% can be 14 
achieved when using palm ash as adsorbent and after pre -treated with biological method of 15 
mixed cultures (Bunrung et al., 2014 , Bunrung et al., 2011 ). However, the characteristics of 16 
POMBPW in their studies were  lower as compared in th is study ; especially the colour and 17 
COD. In addition, the proposed treatment s involve  longer contact time in adsorption where 18 
the decolourisation increased with increase in agitation time, as well as in mixed cultures 19 
cultivation.  20 
Typically, coagulation -flocculation process is regarded as one of the most important treatment 21 
processes of industrial wastewater (Teh et al., 2016 ) and raw water (Teh and Wu, 2014 ) due 22 
to its simplicity, effectiveness, and low energy consumption. Coagulation -flocculation process 23 
is widely used  in industry  in the past few decades . In addition, this process usually used is 24 
used as a pre -treatment to other integrated treatment process such as membrane filtration  25 4 
 (Zahrim et al., 2011 , Citulski et al., 2009 , Harrelkas et al., 2009 ), biological treatment  (El- 1 
Gohary and Tawfik, 2009 , Sklyar et al., 2003 ) and advanced oxidation processes  (Garcia - 2 
Morales e t al., 2012 , Durán et al., 2009 , Ma and Xia, 2009 ). The attribute  of wastewater plays 3 
an important factor in choosing  the most suitable coagulant for the process treatment.  4 
Inorganic coagulants such as aluminum  and iron salts are commonly used in water treatment. 5 
However, they can alter the pH of the treated water, increase toxicity level  and sometimes can 6 
increase the wastewater colour, which can make secondary contamination (Mageshkumar and 7 
Karthikeyan, 2016 , Teh et al., 2016 ).Synthetic organic polymers such as polyacrylamide 8 
(PAM) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) ( PolyDADMAC) have been widely 9 
used not only as flocculant  aids but also as direct flocculation in most industries (Lee et al., 10 
2014 , Zhu et al., 2009 ).Generally, polymers will bind the flocs via bridging mechanism and 11 
produce larger, denser, stronger, and rapid -settling flocs.  The formation of larger and denser 12 
flocs is mainly due to the higher molecular weight of polymer coagulants which improve 13 
interparticle bridging and provide more adsorption sites (Shak and Wu, 2015 , Subramonian et 14 
al., 2015 , Teh et al., 2014 ). 15 
Ferric salt was used to further studied due to problems associated with aluminium  salt. High 16 
concentration of aluminium species in water ma y lead to Alzheimer's disease upon 17 
consumption (Teh et al., 2016 , Bhatti et al., 2009 ). Therefore, the residue of Al3+ content in 18 
the discharge should be below 10 – 15 mg/L according to Malaysian standard (DOE, 2016 ). 19 
Furthermore, several research ers agreed that the usage of alum -based coagulants is not 20 
preferable due to limitation by its concentration (Amuda and Alade, 2006 , Ahmad et al., 21 
2006 , Bhatia et al., 2006 , Zahrim et al., 2011 , Teh et al., 2016 ) hence, it is not suitable to treat 22 
POMBPW.  23 
Over  the years, the usage of dual coagulants (inorganic coagulant and polymer  based 24 
coagulant) has benefit s over the sole use of inorganic or polymer coagulants.  These benefits 25 5 
 are mostly related to the reduction of the inorganic coagulant dosage while producing larger, 1 
denser, and stronger flocs (Lee et al., 2014 ). Several studies have re ported the effectiveness of 2 
dual coagulants application when dealing with various types of wastewater where it can 3 
reduce  up to 90% of COD, total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, and colour. Furthermore, it 4 
can reduce the consumption of coagulant demand,  thus reduce the overall cost of the 5 
coagulation -flocculation process (Lee et al., 2014 , Zahrim et al., 2014 , Irfan et al., 2013 , Sher 6 
et al., 2013 , Martín et al., 2011 , Amuda and Amoo, 2007 , Amuda and Alade, 2006 , Ahmad et 7 
al., 2005a ). 8 
The concern in accumulation of large amount of sludge from this process has led to find ing 9 
the best way to manage the  sludge in economically and environmentally approach. To the best 10 
of our knowledge, there were small amount of work in the literature concerning studies of 11 
phytotoxicity from sludge generated through  the coagulation -flocculation process  alone . Most 12 
researchers combine the coagulation -flocculation with another treatment process in which to 13 
further degrade the organic compound to lower level.  Bedekar et al.  (2016)  reported that the 14 
coagulated dye sludge was fermented by using consortium -BBA and found that the 15 
phytotoxicity was decreased after coagulation and degradation mechanism  (Bedekar et al., 16 
2016 ). In another study, combination of coagulation, acid cracking, and Fenton -like process 17 
could result the phytotoxicity of final olive oil mill wastewater to decrease (Yazdanbakhsh et 18 
al., 201 5). Another combinati on was reported by Turki et al.  (2015) , where they found high 19 
toxicity removal up to 90% in their phytotoxicity test of landfill leachates. The combination 20 
was coagulation -flocculation -Fenton and powder zeolite adsorption (Turki  et al., 2015 ). 21 
Lee et  al. (2011) has used a ferric chloride –polyacrylamide inorganic –organic hybrid polymer 22 
which was synthesized using a ferric chloride/polyacrylamide ratio of 1:1 via free radical 23 
solution polymerization. The hybrid polymer was then tested on kaolin suspension 24 
flocculating activit ies and Terasil Red R dye wastewater and the results showed it is capable 25 6 
 to decolourise up to 99% of colour  (Lee et al., 2011 ). Another study reported by Yang et al. 1 
(2014) used polyferric chloride (PFC) and poly(epichlorohydrin -dimethylamine) [P(ECH - 2 
DAM)] to test for the coagulation treatment of reactive dye suspensions and found that 3 
compos ite PFC -P(ECH -DAM) can improved charac teristics, such as increased efficient 4 
polymeric speciation concentration, improved zeta potential, and enhanced flocculation 5 
performance (Yang et al., 2014 ). In summary, both of these studies were using hybrid 6 
polymer and focusing on  dye wastewater. The hybrid polymer synthesizing  is time 7 
consuming due to the complicated preparation (Lin et al. , 2013 ). To the best of our 8 
knowledge, there is no publication in the literature  dealt with  dual coagulants before in 9 
POMBPW  decolourisation . 10 
In this study, the ability of various coagulants in removing colour of POMBPW was 11 
investigated by various metal  coagulants  such as  ferric chloride, calcium lactate, magnesium 12 
hydroxide, and aluminium  chlorohydrate. The n, the addition of polymers i.e. polyDADMAC 13 
and PAMs  as flocculant aids was studied . Last but not least, the coagulation kinetic order was 14 
predicted and phytotoxicity  test of the filtered sludge was carried out.  15 
1.1 Coagulation kinetics  16 
The kinetics of coagulation process can be described as  (Mageshkumar and Karthikeyan, 17 
2016 , Nnaji et al., 2014 ); 18

where "C" is the total mass of particle per litre, "t" is the coagulation time, "k" is the  nth order 20 
coagulation rate constant, and "n" is the order of the coagulation process.  The turbidity 21 
concentration decrease as a function of increasing time (t), is represented as a negative sign in 22 
Eq. (1).  23 7 
 During the coagulation process, the rate of removal of colour is proportional to the initial 1 
colour concentration and amount of coagulant used. For a  first order (n = 1) coagulation 2 
process, the rate equation is shown as;  3

where "C o" is initial colour of the POMBPW in PtCo, "C" is final colour of the POMBPW at 7

ln(C o/C) against time (t) should be a straight line pass ing through the origin and the slope is 9 
k1. However, if the line do es not pass through the origin  but intercept s along the Y -axis line, it 10 
follows second order coagulation process (n = 2) which is shown as;  11

2.1 Materials  17 
The biogas plant wastewater was collected from the Lahad  Datu, Sabah. In this mill, t he palm 18 
oil mill effluent ( POME ) from the cooling pond is fed into three anaerobic digester  tanks  19 8 
 which  are located in the biogas plant area. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) for the  three  1 
tanks is ~18 days . The wastewater is appeared to be blackish in colour  (Dexter et al., 2016 ). 2

Five types of metal coagulants ; calcium lactate, magnesium hydroxide,  ferric chloride 7 
hexahydrate, and aluminium  chlorohydrate (two types)  are used . Calcium lactate (Molecular 8 
mass 308.32 g/mol) (Merck, Germany), magnesium hydroxide (Molecular mass 58.32 g/mol) 9 
(Sigma -Aldrich, USA), and ferric chloride hexahydrate  (Molecular mass 270.30 g/mol) 10 
(Techno Pharmchem, India) were prepared by dissolving their solid form in distilled water. 11 
Two flocculants  in liquid form were supplied by Chemkimia  Sdn. Bhd. Both flocculants  are 12 
aluminium  chlorohydrate; Chemchlor CK -800 and  Chemchlor CK -1000 are in 45% wt, also 13 
prepared by dissolving in distilled water. Polymers used in this study include  polyDADMAC  14 
and cationic/anionic polyacrylamide . The polyDADMAC (Tramfloc® 724, 40% wt)  and 15 
anionic polyacrylamide i.e. Tramfloc® 141  (anionic ) were supplied by  Tramfloc, Inc., 16 
Houston, Texas. Another polymers: AN  1500 (anionic), AN 1800 (anionic), QF 25610 17 9

2.2 Experimental set -up 3 
The coagulation process with vari ous concentration s of metal coagulants  solution ranging 4 
from 500 – 10,000 mg/L was conducted using a standard jar test equipment (Phipps & 5 
Birds™) (Zahrim et al., 2014 ). The solution pH was adjusted using 1.0M of hydrochloric acid 6 
or 1.0M of sodium hydroxide in order to observe the effect o f pH during coagulation - 7 
flocculation  process. The effect of various  polymer s as flocculant  aids was carried out  after 8 
the best coagulant and dosage was determined,  9 11 
 2.3 Physico -chemical analysis  1 
The colour was analysed  using V -650 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Jasco). The absorbance   at 2 
455 nm was used to analyse the apparent colour by using APHA 8025 Method (APHA 3 
Platinum -Cobalt Standard Method) . The pH and conductivity were determined using HI 4 
9611 -5 Meter (Hanna Instrume nt). 5 
2.4 Zeta potential  6 
After sedimentation, the supernatant was filled in the capillary cell and inserted into the zeta 7 
potential equipment's compartment with the weld line facing in front of the instrument.  Zeta 8 
potential was measured using a Malvern -Zetasizer Nano Series model ZS. Each sample 9 
measurement was taken at least three times in order to obtain the best result. Finally, results 10 
are obtained and the zeta potential ranges are evaluated based on different samples.  11 
Supporting measurement of zeta potential permitted a more detailed study on the relation 12 
between coagulants properties and treatment effectiveness (Shak and Wu , 2017 ). 13 
2.5 Germination index  14 
The settled solids were filtered using a vacuum pump an d dried using an oven. The dry solids 15 
were tested their phytotoxicity based on germination index (GI). Cabbage seeds were used in 16 
this GI test with a mixture of 50% dry solids  and 50% commercial  soil (Troy et al., 2013 , 17 
Prasad et al., 2010 ).The commercial soil was supplied by Jaya Pot Enterprise, Malaysia, 18 
consists of 0.15% sodium, 0.50% phosphorus, 0.30% potassium, and 0.15% magnesium 19 
oxide. The mixture was added to 25 mL of distilled water and mixed thoroughly together t o 20 
make a water -soluble extract. The extract was then analysed for its pH and conductivity. 21 
Fifteen seeds were sown in a 5 mL of water -soluble extract in  a petri dish. As a control, 5 mL 22 
of distilled water was added in a petri dish along with the cabbage seeds. Each test was 23 12 
 undertaken in  triplicate  and the dishes were  put in a dark room at room temperature.  After 1 
three days  (72 hours) , the germinated seeds were counted and measured the root length.  The 2 
result of GI test was calculated as follows  (Tiquia and Tam, 199 8): 3 
Relative seed germination (RSG%)=number of seed germinated in sample extract
number of seed germinated in control×100   (6) 4

 3. Results and discussion  1 
3.1 Flocculation using metal coagulant  2 
3.1.1 Effect of metal coagulant  type 3 
Fig. 1 a shows the effect of coagulant on the colour removal of POMBPW at the dosage of 4 
8000 mg/L. CK-800 gives the highest removal i.e. 87.9%, followed by ferric chloride 5 
(82.6%), CK -1000 (80.7%), magnesium hydroxide (77.5%), calcium lactate (32.0%), and 6 
polyDADMAC  (22.5%).  It was observed that during CK -800, CK -1000, and rejection of 7 
ferric chloride i nto the wastewater, t here was an instant formation of flocs occurred . It is 8 
believed due to charge neutralization mechan ism. According to (Saukkoriipi, 2010 ), the 9 
charge neutralization occurs in between 0.01–1 second  while another mechanism,  i.e. sweep 10 
coagulation, occurs in the range of 1 –7 seconds (Lu et al., 2005 ). The most probable reason 11 
for this is that wastewater particles are normally negatively charged, cationic coagulants can 12 
neutralize or reduce the negative charge on the particles . As a result, the electrical repulsion 13 
force is decreased between particles, and van der Waals force of attraction is fo rmed to 14 
promote initial aggregation of colloidal and fine suspended materials to form microfloc  (Lee 15 
et al., 2014 , Bolto and Gregory, 2007 , James et al., 2003 ). Contrary with magnesium 16 
hydroxide and calcium lactate, where there was no instant formation of flocs after adding 17 
them  into the wastewater. Instead, precipitation  was formed during the process. One of the 18 
main reasons  is the solubility that may affect the behaviour of the coagulant. Low solubility of 19 
magnesium hydroxide  (0.009 g/L) form s precipitates , where precipitates adsorb to and 20 
enmesh particles  as the flocs settle (FCH, 2011 , Duan and Gregory, 2003 ). The precipitates 21 
have large adsorptive surface area and positive electrostatic surface charge that can attract the 22 
negatively charged particles in the solution (Zahrim and Dexter, 2016 , Zhang et al., 2011 , 23 
Gao et al., 2007 , Semerjian and Ayoub, 2003 ). This is the most probable  reason why the 24 14 
 amount of settled solids was  higher due to mix ing with white precipitate at the bottom of the 1 
beaker.  Similar phenomena occur  with the calcium lactate, however  calcium (1.0) is less er 2 
electronegative than the magnesium (1.2), thus particles in the solution is less attracted to 3 
calcium compared to magnesium.  PolyDADMAC might make the flocs undergo charge 4 
neutralization and bridging me chanisms (Zahrim and Dexter, 2016 , Pearse, 2005 ). However, 5 
the colour removal was the lowest compared to others due to an excess of polyDADMAC 6 
molecules that cause charge reversal occurs on the particle surfaces (Zahrim et al., 2014 , 7 
Ariffin et al., 2012 ). In addition, polyDADMAC  alone  can achieve up to 40% of colour 8 
removal at dosage of 1000 mg/L as shown elsewhere (Zahrim and Dexter, 2016 ). 9

Fig.1b shows the zeta potential value after the coagulation -flocculation  process at the dosage 5 
of 8000 mg/L. Initially, the zeta potential value for the wastewater was -13.35 mV, showing 6 
the presence of negatively charged particles in the wastewater. The presence of positively 7 
charged coagulant adsorbs onto the particle surface thus alter s the zeta potential value to 8 
lower negative value  (Tripathy and De, 2006 ). PolyDADMAC gives a very drastic change 9 
due to high solubility at the given pH and completion of charge neutralization mechanism. 10 
Electrostatic interactions are the main factor for the  particles to transfer from the water to the 11 
polymer ch ain during flocculation  (Zemaitaitiene et al., 2003 ). Positive value indicates the 12

flocculation  process, i.e N+ attach ed or are adsorbed by the neutralized particles (Zahrim et 14 
al., 2015 , Ariffin et al., 2012 ). Less increment s were observe d in calcium lactate and 15 
magnesium hydroxide ,which  might be due to a weak ioniza tion behaviour of both flocculants 16 
(Zahrim et al., 2015 ). This might be the cause for insignificant change in zeta potential value.  17 0500010000150002000025000

 Fig. 1c shows the  effect of metal flocculants on treated water pH and conductivity . The 1 
wastewater pH was increase d from the initial pH of 7.95 to 8. 05, 8.40, and 8.30 in calcium 2 
lactate, magnesium hydroxide and polyDADMAC  respectively . The increment of pH for the 3 
first two flocculants are due to the presence of hydroxide ion (OH-) when dissociated and 4 
dissolved in water and the presence of OH- ions indicat ing that  the properties of the solution is 5 
basic (Bruice, 2007 ).In the polyDADMA C case, it is due to a wide range pH that has lift ed up 6 
the value.  Hydrolysis phenomenon might occur during the process which is at pH higher than 7 
5.5 (SNF-FLOERGER, 2015 , Zahrim et al., 2015 ). Contrary with the other flocculants, they 8 
tend to  decrease the final pH to 7.15, 7.55, and 6.42 for CK -1000, CK -800, and ferric chloride 9 
respectively. This is due to the characteristic of Fe3+ and Al3+ that behave s as Lewis acid, 10 
react s with OH- ions (Lewis base) of wastewater precipitate in the form of Fe(OH) 3 or 11 
Al(OH) 3 (Song et al., 2004 , Amokrane et al., 1997 ). Thus, by adding Lewis acid into a 12 
solution, it should dec rease the pH by changing the balance between H+ and OH- ions. 13 
Normally, inorganic coagulants such as iron and aluminum salts may lower the alkalinity and 14 
pH of the solution  into acidic condition (Zahrim et a l., 2010 ). Therefore, the treated 15 
wastewater cannot be directly discharge d into the watercourse, hence it needs to be 16 
neutralized  (Zahrim et al., 2015 ). The conductivity of raw POMBPW indicates the total of 17 
ionized constituent of water related to the total sum of inorganic cations or anions that presen t 18 
in water (Fondriest, 2015 , Emerson, 2010 ). This means that  high conductivity indicates the 19 
water contains a large amount of inorganic salt and other ions. High conductivity in the 20 
receiving water may result in undesirable ecological effects on aquatic organisms (Morrison 21 
et al., 2001 , Zahrim and Mariani, 2014 ). Nevertheless, the aim of this paper is to investigate 22 
the coagulation -flocculation process as a membrane pre-treatment.  Overall, t he conductivit ies 23 
of treated water have increased  from  around 1% to 13.5% for calcium lactate, CK -1000, 24 
magnesium hydroxide, ferric chloride, and polyDADMAC. This is due to the presence of 25 17 
 excess unreacted chemical ions  (Zahrim et al., 2015 , Solberg and Wagberg, 2003 ). However, 1 
the conductiv ity for treated water using CK -800 reduced  around  6%. The dissolved organics 2 
were removed by adsorption and precipitation along with the settlement of flocs (Van 3 
Benschoten and Edzwald, 1990 ). These findings indicate that the coagulation -flocculation  4 
process might rele ase a minimum amount of residual flocculant  in the treated water.  5 
3.1.2 Effect of ferric chloride  dosage  6 
Fig.2a shows the colour removal at different dosage ranging from 500 – 10000 mg/L. From 7 
this figure, the colour removal increased with increasing dosage of ferric chloride up to 9000 8 
mg/L, with a maximum of 82.8% colour removal achieved. High dosage was needed due to  9 
deal with high recalcitrant organic matter content and initial appearance of the raw 10 
POMBPW , which is blackish in colour. However, the colour removal was seen to be 11 
consistent  at 7000 to 9000 mg/L dosage, i.e. the particles are further away from each other 12 
(Zahrim et al., 2015 , Ariffin et al., 2012 ).Ahead of the optimal dosage of ferric chloride , the 13 
particles are re -stabilized and charge reversal take s place on the particle surface due to an 14 
excess of ferric chloride  molecules (Zahrim et al., 2015 , Ariffin et al., 2012 ).Furthermore, the  15 
appearance of the pretreated POMBPW was  changed  into dark orange hence, the  colour 16 
removal was drop to 36% .  17 18

Fig. 2b shows the zeta potential at different dosage of ferric chloride. It clearly shows that the 6 
zeta potential value increases as the ferric chloride dosage. Cationic inorganic salt is capable 7 
to reduce the negative charge of particles by charge ne utralization (Zahrim et al., 2015 , Lee 8 
and Westerhoff, 2006 ). Electrical repulsion between particles is reduced, which results  the 9 
formation of flocs and surface charge reduction (Bolto and Gregory, 2007 , James et al., 10 
2003 ).Fig. 2c shows the treated pH and conductivity at different dosages by ferric chloride. 11 
As the dosage increases, the treated solution pH decrease indicates that ferric chloride lower 12 0102030405060708090100

Inorganic salt s in solution form react with alkalinity in the water to form insoluble hydrous 2 
oxide that coagulate by sweep flocculation and charge neutralization (Zeta-Meter, 1988 ).The 3 
conductivity shows increment of value as the dosage increase. This is due to the presence of 4 
unreacted ferric chloride  as residues in the wastewater  (Solber g and Wagberg, 2003 ).  5

3.1.3 Effect of pH  8 
Fig. 3a shows the colour removal and zeta potential value of POMBPW after treatment by 9 
ferric chloride at various pH values. From th is figure, we can see  that the pH of POMBPW 10 
has an influence on coagulation -flocculation  through  using ferric chloride. Furthermore, the 11 
figure shows an  optimum colour removal was at pH 10.0  giving  93.0% removal. This high 12 
removal may be due to the presence of most of the ferric chloride hydrolysates, such as 13 
Fe(OH)2+ and 

2 Fe(OH)  in the solution . These are  then neutralized by abundance of OH- ions 14 
and anionic particles in the POMBPW (Boules treau and Miehe, 2010 , Duan and Gregory, 15 
2003 ). However, at pH below 10.0, the colour removal w as in the range of 83.0 -87.0%, which 16 
indicates the abundance of H+ ions in acidic solution over anionic particles, hence restricted 17 
the charge neutralization to take place. It can be elucidated in the zeta potential profile, where 18 
the value was beyond zero at pH 3.0 and 6.0 indicating that  the solution contains more 19 
catio nic ions  after neutralization take place . The initial zeta potential value at pH 3.0 and 6.0 20 
was -5.95 mV and -9.53 mV respectively. Same case with at pH 7.0 and 10.0, where the zeta 21 
potential value was increased from -15.00 mV and -16.28 mV respectively  after the addition 22 
of ferric chloride, however the dosage was not enough to neutralize completely the anionic 23 
particles in the solution.  24 20

Fig. 3b shows the pH and conductivity after coagulation -flocculation  process by ferric 5 
chloride at various pH values.  It clearly show s that  inorganic metal salts tend to decrease the 6 
pH solution regardless the pH.  At pH 3 .0and 6.0, the solution is too acidic and  cannot be 7 
directly discharged into the watercourse hence it need s to be re -neutralized and this can 8 
increase the capital cost. Beyond those values, i.e. 7.0and 10.0, the solution  showed nearly 9 
neutral pH and therefore can be directly disch arged into the watercourse as they  meet the 10 
discharge requirement standard  (5.0−9.0) by the Malaysian Department of Environment 11 
(Liew et al., 2015 ). However, it seems impracticable to adjust the pH up to 10.0 just to 12 
achieve nearly neutral pH after treatment as it involves more cost. The conductivit ies result 13 
show very high value at pH 3.0 and 6.0 due to an excess of unreacted ferric chloride and also  14 
hydrochloric acid  in the solution  which has the  same charge . Slightly high removal was 15 
observed at pH 3.0 due to self-aggregation of POMBPW particles at acidic conditions. 16 
However, at pH 7.0 and 10.0, the conductivities were much less er due to improvement of 17 
flocculation.  18 -10-8-6-4-2024

 3.2 Flocculation using ferric chloride -polymer  1 
In this preliminary study, polyDADMAC was added as a flocculation aid to ferric chloride in 2 
order to reduce the dosage of ferric chloride . PolyDADMAC dosage was fixed at 8 mg/L and  3 
was added into the solution during slow mixing time.  Based on the Fig. 4, the colour removal 4 
was increasing as the dosage of ferric chloride increased. The optimum dosage of ferric 5 
chloride was found to be at 5800 mg/L, i.e . 83.4% removal. Beyond this optimum dosage, the 6 
removal was observed to be consistent.  The zeta potential profile also shows increment of 7 
value towards zero as the dosage of ferric chloride was increased. Cationic ions that are 8 
presence in ferric chloride and polyDADMAC were affect ed the behavio ur of particles 9 
surface charge  measurement  in the solution during charge neutralization mechanism.  10

3.2.1 Effect of polymer type  15 
Six types of polyacry lamide (PAM) with different charge and molecular weight were tested 16 
and compared the performance in treating POMBPW as a flocculation aid. Fig. 5ashows that  17

 91.5%, followe d by Tramfloc 724 (polyDADMAC) . Based on this figure, the usage of dual 1 
coagulants could enhance s the coagulation -flocculation  process compared to the use of sole 2 
coagulant application which gave  only at 60.1% removal. However, not all dual coagulants 3 
combination  show  good colour removal. The lowest removal was recorded at 46.2% by 4 
QF23912 followed by QF25610  and QF24807  at 58.8% and 63.1% removal  respectively . The 5 
reason behind this isthat  PAM s are cationic. The availability of cationic ions from this d ual 6 
coagulants exceed ed the requirement of charge neutralization occurrence , hence it deteriorates  7 
the performance, resulting restabilization of flocs due to charge reversal (Lee et al., 2014 , 8 
Bolto and Gregory, 2007 , Duan and Gregory, 2003 ). Another two flocculants , i.e AN1500 9 
and AN1800 were observed which could slightly enhance the removal at 73.1% and 71.4% 10 
respectively.  Inorganic metal salts are often combined with anionic or non -ionic po lymeric 11 
flocculants in the coagulation -flocculation  process to enhance the overall performance (Lee et 12 
al., 2014 , Chong, 2012 ).After charge neutralization  by ferric chloride , APAM molecules 13 
extend into solution and produce loops and tails to promote bridging of flocs (Lee et al., 2014 , 14 
Bolto and Gregory, 2007 ). However, the APAM dosage was not sufficient to form bridging 15 
contact.  Fig. 5b shows the pH and conductivity of treated POMBPW by ferric chloride 16 
coupled with various types  of polymers. Based on the figure, the pH was consistent despite 17 
the type of polymer used, which clearly indicate s that the solution was not affected by the 18 
polymer due to the dosage was small. Co ntrary with conductivity, lowest value was observed 19 
at 13000 µS/cm by ferric chloride -polyDADMAC and ferric chloride -APAM. This indicates 20 
that the dissolved organics have  also been removed during the coagulation -flocculation  21 
process.  22 23

3.2.2 Effect of flocculant aids dosage  6 
The study was extended by varying the polymer dosage from 0 to 10 mg/L for 7 
polyDAD MAC and APAM as the best dual coagulants combination. This study was 8 
conducted in two different  sets namely for ferric chloride -APAM and ferric chloride - 9 
polyDADMAC respectively with both sets have three  trial runs.  Based on Fig. 6, ferric 10 020406080100Colour removal, %

 chloride -APAM combination shows increas e in colour removal as the dosage of APAM was 1 
increased, whereas for ferr ic chloride -polyDADMAC combination,  the removal was 2 
consistent regardless the polyDADMAC  dosage.  It shows that polyDADMAC  slightly  affect 3 
the decolourisation whereas ferric chloride was primarily affect the overall performance. The 4 
highly viscous propertie s of APAM solution was suitable to be used as a flocculation aid 5 
since the POMBPW was rich in suspended solids  content . The refore, it bridges most of the 6 
microflocs into macroflocs during the process.  However, it was reported that the presence of 7 
multivalent metal ions such as ferric ions (Fe3+) could severely affect the flocculation by 8 
APAM , due to complexation of the metal with carboxylate groups on the polymer chain and 9 
thus effective reduction in c harge density (Bolto and Gregory, 2007 , Hender son and Wheatley, 10 
1987 ). Even so, ferric chloride -APAM combination did not show any bad result , in fact  it can 11 
still give s over 90% of colour removal  at dosage of 8 mg/L and 10 mg/L . Such a finding 12 
implies that the concentration  of APAM was sufficient enough to use as a flocculation aid 13 
with the specific concentration of ferric chloride  used in this study.  14

 3.2.3 Effect of pH  1 
The performances of dual coagulants were  then tested at various pH as shown in Fig. 7. Based  2 
on the figure, it was found the colour removal by using ferric chloride -APAM doesn’t show 3 
significant changes from pH 6.0 to 10. 0. As mentioned before, APAM acts as a "bridger" and 4 
attach es the particles altogether during the flocculation process despite the changes of pH. 5 
The destabilized particles aggregate into a large mass and settle fast. Similar find ing was 6 
reported by (Ariffin et al., 2012 ). Hence, it can be deduced that the solution properties also 7 
have  significant  effects  on the colour removal a s has been explained earlier.  For ferric 8 
chloride -polyDADMAC case, the colour removal drop ped drastically at pH 10.0. It can be 9 
elucidated with high availability of OH-ions in the solution which cause  stronger mutual 10 
repulsion between the particles. Thus, the concentration of ferric chloride -polyDADMAC was 11 
not sufficient enough to suppress the cha rged surface layer of the particles  and to produce 12 
flocs.  13

 During the coagulation -flocculation  process, the settling speed of flocs determines  the 1 
efficiency of the whole process. Sedimentation time of the flocs in the POMBPW was 2 
investigated at 20, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes as shown in Fig. 8. Based on the figure, it 3 
was observed that the sedimentation of flocs from ferric chloride -APAM combination was 4 
faster than the ferric chlo ride-polyDADMAC combination during the first 20 minutes. It 5 
doubles the removal after another 10 minutes, however still no change was observed in ferric 6 
chloride -polyDADMAC combination  until 60 minutes of sedimentation . Both dual coagulants 7 
were recorded t o achieve over 90% of colour removal at 180 minutes. However, for ferric 8 
chloride -APAM combination, the removal was recorded with no significant change from 120 9 
to 180 minutes since most of the flocs were already settled. The ferric chloride -APAM was 10 
efficient in producing high density of flocs in this kind of wastewater which can settle fast. 11 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the optimum sedimentation time for this process was at 12 
120 minutes as per recorded in this study.  13

 The plot fo r second order kinetic to the experimenta l data of the coagulation -flocculation 1 
process carried out on the POMBPW using ferric chloride coupled with polymers i.e. 2 
polyDADMAC  and APAM  is shown in Fig. 9. Based on the figure, it was observed that there 3 
is a linear relationship between 1/C versus reaction time, t. The plot in this graph obeys 4 
second order kinetic equation as it shows the Y -axis intercept.  Similar finding of second order 5 
kinetic result were reported by several researchers (Mageshkumar and Karthikeyan, 2016 , 6 
Vijayaraghavan and Shanthakumar, 201 5, Nnaji et al., 2014 ). The kinetic constant for ferric 7 
chloride -polyDADMAC  and ferric chloride -APAM  were 2×10-5/PtCo.min  and 3×10-8 
5/PtCo.min  respectively.  Based on these rate constant values, ferric chloride -APAM  was 9 
higher than ferric chloride -polyDADMAC , which indicates that the rate of reduction in 10 
colour is faster for ferric chloride -APAM  than ferric chloride -polyDADMAC . APAM  11 
enhances the flocculation by creating larger floc size from microflocs to macroflocs which 12 
yields to a rapid settling (Teh et al., 2016 , Aguilar et al., 20 05). Table 4 shows the relationship  13 
between half-life period  (t1/2) with initial colour of POMBPW for both dual coagulants.  It 14 
should be noted that the half-life value was small due to the type of colour measurement used 15 
in this study. However, it still show s the ferric chloride -APAM was faster in terms of 16 
reduc tion to one -half the original colour.  17

A simple cost evaluation of using sole coagulant, dual coagulants, and other treatment 6 
methods has been compared  and the results are shown in Table 5 . The cost of chemical used 7 
in all studies are roughly calculated and compared to this study. The calculati ons are based on 8 
the respective optimum dosage for the treatment of one m3 of wastewater  feed.  9 
From the table, studies from Ahmad et al. (2006 and 2005b) possess the cheapest cost, 10 
however the studies only mentioned about removal of residual oil and suspen ded solid i.e. 11 
more than 95% removal. Dual coagulants showed a very reasonable cost in treating 12 
POMBPW that is still consists of high COD value. The total cost for both dual coagulants  are 13 
US $ 5.80/m3 of POMBPW feed  and can be considered as economical in treating POMBPW.  14 
In addition, the cost is reduced to 27% from the sole ferric chloride used and yet achieved 15 
higher decolourisation.  16

Cabbage seed was used in germination tests  due to it is one of the main highland vegetable 9 
that is mostly planted here in Sabah, Malaysia (Jipanin et al., 2001 ). The tests were performed 10 
to access the phytotoxicity of the settled solids from the coagulation -flocculation  process  and 11 
the results are shown in Fig. 10. The test was a continuation to previous experiment 12 
(subsection 3.2.1), where the sludge was collected after the coagulation -flocculation  process. 13 
Therefore, the extracts have equivalent amount of ferric chloride dosage (5800 mg/L) and 14 
polymer (8 mg/L) i.e. APAM and polyDADMAC. Based on Figure  10, all extracts show GI  15 
value above 80% which indicated phytotoxins free (Troy et al., 2013 , Tiquia and Tam, 1998 ). 16 
It was reported that GI% values below 50% indicated the presence of phytotoxic compounds 17 
in the water -soluble extracts (Troy et al., 2013 ). Studies in ag ricultural field by using APAM 18 
showed that the  application of APAM to the soil may improve the soil permeability, 19 
stabilizing the soil structure, minimizing dispersion, and encourage aggregate formation to 20 
enhance pore continuity  (Kumar and Saha, 2011 , Jiang et al., 2010 , Busscher et al., 2007 , 21 
Entry et al., 2002 , Sojka and Entry, 2000 ). Furthermore, APAM had a significant effect on the 22 
reduction of surface runoff and nutrient loss from the soil (Sojka et al., 2007 , Flanagan and 23 
Canady, 2006 , Lentz et al., 2001 ). In another study , (Skene et al., 1995)   reported that 24 31 
 alum/polyDADMAC sludge could be used as plant growth medium when it is mixed with 1 
fertiliser.  While in water, hydrophobic  groups of polymer  travelled inside the aggregates and 2 
created hydration of hydrophilic groups and water molecules by hydrogen bonding. This bond 3 
produces a water molecule monolayer on the surface of aggregates. Osmotic pressure gradient 4 
was formed due to the ion concentrat ion gradient between the inner and outer of the 5 
monolayer, which prevents some water molecules inside the layer from moving freely, thus 6 
limiting soil nutrient losses (Jiang et al., 2010 , Yuan et al., 2005 ).  7

Decolourisation  of POMBPW using various metal flocculants including calcium lactate, ferric 12 
chloride, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum chlorohydrate (CK -1000 and CK -800), and 13 
polyDADMAC ; was investigated . The optimum colour  removal was found at coagulant 14 
dosage 8000 mg/L for ferric chloride. At pH 10.0, ferric chloride showed a good performance 15 
in removing colour up to 90%.  16 149 108 91 137

 Dual coagulants shows better performance than the sole ferric chloride, not only in terms of 1 
colour re moval but also reduces the amount of ferric chloride used in the treatment.  The dual 2 
coagulants of ferric chloride -APAM was found to be the best combination compared to ferric 3 
chloride -polyDADMAC, where it can achieve up to 90% of colour removal , and was n ot 4 
affected by the changes in POMBPW pH at higher value . Furthermore, it can produce  high 5 
density flocs which can settle fast at early of 20 minutes of sedimentation.  6 
The coagulation -flocculation  process followed second order kinetic equation for both dua l 7 
coagulants. The kinetic rate constant for ferric chloride -APAM was found to be more than the 8 
ferric chloride -polyDADMAC, which indicates rapid settling of flocs. The germination index 9 
result s show  both dual coagulants were phytotoxin free  i.e. 91% and 137% for ferric chloride - 10 
APAM and ferric chloride -polyDADMAC respectively , thus they have the potential to be 11 
reused for land application in the future.   12
