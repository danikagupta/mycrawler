Abstract
The ability of fresh water macroalga Azolla ﬁliculoides to biosorb Acid Blue 15 from aqueous solution was investigated in batch
and column studies. Batch experiments were conducted to study the eﬀect of initial solution pH and dye concentration. Langmuirand Freundlich isotherm models were used to ﬁt the equilibrium data. The maximum dye uptake of 116.28 mg/g was observed at pH 7,
according to Langmuir model. In column experiments, eﬀects of bed height (15 e25 cm), ﬂow rate (5 e15 ml/min) and initial dye
concentration (50 e100 mg/l) on dye removal were studied. An increase in bed height and initial dye concentration favors the dye
biosorption, while the minimum ﬂow rate produced maximum dye biosorption. At optimum bed height (25 cm), ﬂow rate (5 ml/min)and initial dye concentration (100 mg/l), A. ﬁliculoides exhibited an uptake of 35.98 mg/g of Acid blue 15. The Bed Depth Service
Time model and the Thomas model were used to analyze the column experimental data and the model parameters were evaluated.

1. Introduction
Many industries, such as textile, paper, plastics, food,
cosmetics, use dyes in order to color the products. Thedischarge of dye house wastewater into the environmentis aesthetically displeasuring, impedes light penetration,
damages the quality of the receiving streams and may be
toxic to food chain organisms and to aquatic life [1].
A number of processes, like ﬂocculation [2], chemical
coagulation [2], precipitation [2], ozonation [3]and
adsorption [4]have been employed for the treatment
of dye bearing wastewaters. Although the above saidphysical and/or chemical methods have been widelyused, they possess inherent limitations such as highcost, formation of hazardous byproducts and intensive
energy requirements [5]. Biological processes such as
biosorption [6], bioaccumulation [7,8] and biodegrada-
tion [9,10] have been proposed as potential methods
for the removal of dyes from textile wastewater. Amongthese, biosorption is more advantageous for water
treatment in that dead organisms are not aﬀected by
toxic wastes as they do not require a continuous supplyof nutrients and they can be regenerated and reused formany cycles [11].
Several investigators have reported the potential of
diﬀerent biomaterials to biosorb dye from aqueoussolutions, including bacteria [12], fungi [13]and micro-
algae [14]. However, the application of these materials
presents few problems when operated in continuous
mode; among these the solid eliquid separation is
a major constrain. Even though immobilization maysolve this problem, chemical costs and mechanicalstrength should be taken into consideration [15].

Macroalgae, on the other hand, usually possess good
mechanical stability and rigidity, and have been widely
used for heavy metal biosorption [16]. However, no
research attention has been focused on utilization ofmacroalgae for dye removal. Azolla ﬁliculoides , a fresh
water blue green alga, has been shown to eﬀectively bindchromium [17], zinc [18]and nickel [19]from aqueous
solutions. It is commonly found in ditches, ponds, andslow moving streams and is capable of colonizing
rapidly to form dense mats over water surfaces and
thus imposing negative eﬀects on the aquatic ecology[18]. Considering this, A. ﬁliculoides was employed in the
present study for the removal of Acid Blue 15 (AB15) inbatch and column modes.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. A. ﬁliculoides
A. ﬁliculoides was collected from Milk producers
union, Tirunelveli, India. It was then sun dried andcrushed to particle sizes in the range of 1 e2 mm. The
crushed particles were then treated with 0.1 M HClfor 5 h followed by washing with distilled water and
then kept for shaded dry. The resultant biomass wassubsequently used in sorption experiments.
2.2. Batch experiments
Batch biosorption experiments were performed in
a rotary shaker at 150 rpm using 250 ml Erlenmeyerﬂasks containing 0.2 g Azolla biomass in 50 ml of
solution containing diﬀerent AB15 concentration. After12 h, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpmfor 10 min. The dye content in the supernatant wasdetermined using UV-Spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan)
atl
max564 nm. The amount of dye biosorbed was
calculated from the diﬀerence between the dye quantityadded to the biomass and the dye content of thesupernatant using the following equation:
QZ/C255
C
0/C255Cf/C1
!/C18V
M/C19
ð1Þ
where Qis the dye uptake (mg/g); C0and Cfare
the initial and equilibrium dye concentrations in the
solution (mg/l), respectively; Vis the solution volume (l);
andMis the mass of biosorbent (g).
The Langmuir sorption model was chosen for the
estimation of maximum AB15 biosorption by thebiosorbent. The Langmuir isotherm can be expressed as:
QZQmaxbCf
1CbCfð2Þ
where Qmaxis the maximum dye uptake (mg/g) and
bis the Langmuir equilibrium constant (l/mg). For
ﬁtting the experimental data, the Langmuir model waslinearized as follows:

2.3. Column experiments
Continuous ﬂow sorption experiments were con-
ducted in a glass column (2 cm internal diameter and35 cm height). At the top of the column, an adjustableplunger was attached with a 0.5 mm stainless sieve. Atthe bottom of the column, a 0.5 mm stainless sieve wasattached followed by glass wool. A 2 cm high layer of
glass beads (1.5 mm in diameter) was placed at theNomenclature
