ABSTRACT 
Dyes are a group of chemicals that have been widely used in various industries, including 
textile industry.  More than ha lf of dyes have a nitrogen-nit rogen double bond structure in their 
molecules.  These dyes are calle d azo dyes.  Research on removi ng dyes from waster water has 
been done for decades.  Recently, biodegradati on using white rot fungi has emerged as an 
alternative method to traditional physical and chemical means for degradation of the dyes.  Even 
though extensive research has been  done to study the degradation of dyes by white rot fungi, the 
specific mechanism of such degradations, and ho w factors such as pH, buffer, and temperature 
can influence the degradation are still not fully understood.  This study investigated the influence 
of buffer concentration, pH, temperature and ag itation on fungal growth and fungus’ ability to 
decolorize three water soluble dyes.  The optimal culture parameters were established and then 
applied to degradations of five azo dyes.  The degradation products were identified by Gas 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) a nd High performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC).  Pathway of the degradations of both dyes and their primary products were proposed.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION AND REVI EW OF LITERATURE  
 
The first recorded use of dye can be traced back to 2600 BC in China.  In 1856, more 
than 4400 years later, William Henry Perkin acci dentally discovered the first synthetic dye 
"Mauve" while trying to create synthetic quinine.  Since the n, thousands of dyes have been 
manufactured and applied in various industrie s, such as textile, food and automotive.   
Nowadays, India, the former USSR, Eastern Eu rope, China, South Korea and Taiwan consume 
approximately 600,000 tons of dyes a nnually (Ishikawa et al., 2000).  
Depending on the molecular structur e, dyes can often be classifi ed into categories as azo, 
anthraquinone, and phthalocyani ne.  Among all known dyes, more than half contain one or more 
azo bonds in their molecular structures.  Thes e dyes are considered as “azo dyes”.  Azo dyes 
normally have high colorfastness and encompass th e entire visible spectrum.  Many of them are 
easily synthesized from inexpensive and easily obtained starting materials (Bumpus, 1995).   
Dyes are designed and synthesized to have affinity to the materials to be dyed and 
resistance to fading in end uses .  Thus most dyes are quite diffi cult to decolorize or degrade 
when they are discharged into the environment from sources such as textile mills.  In the textile 
industry, up to 15 percent of used dyes are released  to processing water, which can give rise to 
not only visible problems but also environmental concerns (V aidya and Datye, 1982).  Many 
countries have established laws and regulations to reduce the environmental problems brought about by waste textile effluents (Robinson, T. et al., 2001).  Such laws and regulations are 
 1 
increasingly being enforced by the governments since some research has reported that the 
environmental transformation of a few dyes can generate potential carc inogenic and mutagenic 
compounds such as aromatic amines, and n itro-aromatic compounds (Bumpus, 1995, Baughman 
and Perenich, 1988, Weber and Wolfe 1987, C hung et al., 1978).  Different physical and 
chemical methods have been developed to remove  the dyes in textile wa ste effluents in past 
decades.  However, these methods all have their disadvantages (Table 1.1).  Research is still 
ongoing to find less expensive, more effective and environmentally fr iendly alternatives 
(Robinson, T. et al., 2001).  
Over the last two decades, extensive res earch has been done on using biological 
techniques to decolorize and degrade colorant s in wastewater.  Many microorganisms, mainly 
bacteria and fungi, have shown th e ability to decolorize dyes.  In the case of bacteria, the 
degradation often involves an anaerobic reductiv e cleavage of the azo bond, and this can happen 
either extracelluarly or intrac elluarly (Chung et al., 1993; Mechsner et al. 1982).  Only a few 
bacteria species have been found to decolo rize dye aerobically (Jiang and Bishop, 1994).  
Systems have been established to degrade azo dyes in wastewater to achieve complete 
mineralization.  In such systems, azo dyes are first reduced anae robically, followed by 
subsequent aerobic treatment to fu rther degrade the dye to carbon dioxide and wate r (Seshadri et 
al., 1994; Bumpus 1995).   
Other than bacteria, white rot fungi (WRF) are believed to be the most efficient single 
class of microorganism in breaking down synthe tic dyes because of their lack of substrate 
specificity and capability of degrading a wide range of xenobiotics (Wesenberg et al., 2003).  
There have been many studies usi ng WRF to decolorize wastewater over the past 20 years.  Most 
of the attention has been paid to the a white rot fungus named Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
 2 
(Chao and Lee et al., 1994; Crip ps et al., 1990; Spadaro et al ., 1992 and 1994; Ollikka et al., 
1993), from which Tien and Kirk made their milestone discovery of two ligninolytic

peroxidases, lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase  (MnP) (Tien and Kirk, 1983).  
Besides Phanerochaete chrysosporium, other fungi such as Pleurotus ostreatus, Trametes 
versicolor, Bjerkandera and Irpex lacteus have also been recognized for their decolorizing 
ability (Heinfling et al., 1997 and 1998a; Martins et al., 2003; Novotny et al., 2001; Shin and 
Kim, 1998).  In spite of the findings which demons trated that WRF could decolorize a variety of 
dyes, questions still remain as to whether such  dye molecules are eventually degraded to CO 2 
and mineralized.  The few studies that addr essed this question showed that several 14C-labelled 
azo dyes were indeed mineralized to 14CO 2 in the presence of WRF (Paszczynski et al., 1992, 
Sparado et al., 1992).   
 
1.1 White rot fungi and their enzymes  
Wood-rotting basidiomyceteous fungi which cause white-rot in wood are the most 
efficient lignin degraders in the nature.  Biodegr adation of lignin has been studied extensively 
since the 1970’s.  In the 1980’s, studies predom inantly focused on the biochemistry of lignin-
degrading enzymes.  Three major extracellula r enzymes are known to be produced by various 
WRF.  They are LiP (lignin peroxidase), MnP (m anganese peroxidase), a nd laccase.  Some WRF 
produce all three enzymes while ot hers produce only one or two of  them (Hatakka, 1994).  These 
enzymes are produced by WRF during their s econdary metabolism si nce lignin oxidation 
provides no net energy to fungi , and the synthesis and secreti on of these enzymes are often 
induced by limited nutrient levels (mostly  C or N) (Wesenberg et al., 2003). 
Lignin peroxidase (LiP) is a type of heme-containing gl ycoprotein which requires 
hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.  LiP catalyzes the oxidation of  nonphenolic aromatic lignin and 
similar compounds (Hatakka, 2003).   Catalytic oxidation of side  chains of lignin has been 
 4 
reported (Tien and Kirk., 1983), as well as cleava ge of aromatic ring structures (Umezawa and 
Higuchi, 1987).  The catalytic cycl e of LiP is illustrated in Figur e 1.1 (Wesenberg et al., 2003).  
Such a mechanism can also apply to MnP. Native peroxidase is first oxidized by H 2O2 to form 
compound I. The H 2O2 is often produced by glyoxal oxidase and superoxide dismutase 
intracellularly (Leonowicz et al., 1999).  Co mpound I then accepts one electron offered by 
suitable substrates to become compound II. Compound II is finally reduced back to native 
peroxidase by the substrates to complete the catalytic cycle, or be further oxidized to form compound III, which is regarded as an irrevers ible inactivation (Wese nberg et al, 2003).  
Substrates consumed by LiP coul d be lignin as well as recalcitra nt xenobiotics such as textile 
dyes (Wesenberg et al, 2003; Zheng and Obbard, 2002, Valli et al., 1992).  A model substrate for 
LiP is veratryl alcohol (VA), which is also secr eted by the fungi themselves.  The specific role 
played by VA has been studied by a number of rese archers.  It is suggested that VA is oxidized 
by LiP to form a cation radical, and that this ra dical then acts as a diffusible oxidant, mediating 
the oxidation of compounds that are inaccessible to the LiP active site (Harvey et al., 1986).  
Others believe that VA’s function is merely  to protect LiP from the inactivation by H
2O2 (Valli 
et al. 1990).  Later work showed that VA does act as mediator for certain substrates such as the 
phenolic compound, guaiacol (K oduri and Tien, 1995).   
Manganese peroxidase (MnP), another type of heme-containi ng glycoprotein, also plays a 
significant role in lignin degradation. MnP preferentially oxidizes Mn2+ to Mn3+, the latter then 
forming chelates with organic acids such as oxa lic acid, which are also excreted by the fungi  
(Kuan and Tien, 1993; Wariishi et al., 1992).  Su ch chelates can act as highly reactive redox-
mediators to oxidize phenolic compounds (Hata kka 1994).  It has to be recognized that 
 5 
compound I of MnP can be reduced by both Mn2+ and phenolic compounds, whereas only Mn2+ 
can reduce compound II to native peroxidase (Wariishi et al 1988).

Laccase is a group of N-glycosylated extrace llular blue oxidases produced by some 
WRF.  Laccases contain four copper atoms in the active site (Ca ll and Mücke, 1997) and 
catalyze the oxidation of a variet y of aromatic hydrogen donors with the concomitant reduction   
of oxygen to water (Figure 1.2, Wesenberg, D. 2003) .  Moreover, laccases not only oxidize 
phenolic and methoxy-phenolic acid s, but also decarboxylate th em and attack their methoxy 
groups (Wesenberg et al., 2003) 
In addition to LiP, MnP and laccase, another group of peroxidases, versatile peroxidases 
(VP), has been reported to be produced by WRF.  Ve rsatile peroxidase (VP) can be regarded as a 
hybrid between LiP and MnP, since they can oxidize not only Mn2+ but also phenolic and 
nonphenolic aromatic compounds, including dyes.  This group of peroxidases has been found 
from species of Pleurotus and Bjerkendera (Heinfling et al., 1998a and 1998b; Mester and Field, 
1998). 
 
1.2 Decolorization or degradation of textile dyes by white rot fungi 
Due to the non-specificity of WRF and the st ructural similarity be tween dyes and lignin, 
many attempts have been made to use WRF to d ecolorize dyes.  Early efforts have concentrated 
on using Phanerochaete chrysosporium  to decolorize various dyes due to its much studied 
degradation of lignin.  Several dyes and xe nobiotics were reported as degraded by 
Phanerochaete  chrysosporium ; furthermore, these compounds we re found to be mineralized to 
CO 2 to different degrees (Sparado et al., 199 2).  The correlation between LiP secreted by 
Phanerochaete  chrysosporium  and decolorization was indicated when decolorizations of azo, 
triphenyl methane, heterocyclic and polymeric dye s were observed. Most of the dyes lost over 75 
percent of their color.  The isolated LiP isozym es showed comparable ability to decolorize dyes 
 7 
to that of crude Phanerochaete chrysosporium  culture in the presence of veratryl alcohol, 
suggesting that LiP plays a major role in the decolorization, and that MnP is not necessarily 
required to start the degradation of these dyes (O llika et al., 1993).  C.I. Disperse Yellow 3 was 
also found efficiently decolorized by Phanerochaete chrysosporium ; 4-methyl-1,2-benzoquinone 
and acetanilide were identified as  degradation products.  Surprising ly, a dimer of the initial dye 
molecule was also found (Sparado et al., 1994).   Attempts have also been made to find out how 
aromatic substitution patterns can influence azo dye degradability by Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  (Pasti-Grigsby et al., 1992, Martins, M. et al., 2001).  Nevertheless, the 
relationships between the substi tution patterns and degradability are still not fully clear.  
Thanks to the increas ing recognition of Phanerochaete chrysosporium ’s capability to 
decolorize various dyes, many other WRF have b een studied for decolorization.  Of the 18 
strains of WRF studied by Heinfling et al., Trametes versicolor and Bjerkandera adusta 
demonstrated their effectiveness in decoloriza tion of three azo dyes and two phthalocyanine dyes 
(Heinfling et al., 1997).  Another WRF, Irpex Lacteus,  was shown to completely decolorize six 
different groups of dyes (monoazo, diazo, anthra quinone, heterocyclic , triphenylmethane, 
phthalocyanine) within ten days (Novotny et al., 2001).  Or ange G was observed to be 
decolorized to a great extent by Pleurotus sajorcaju  (Chagas and Durrant, 2001).  Thelephroa sp. 
also decolorized Orange G, and a maximum of  61 percent decolorization of a dye industry 
effluent was also achieved by this  fungus (Selvam et al, 2003).  
 
1.3 Decolorization by Pleurotus ostreatus  and its enzymes 
Pleurotus ostreatus , a type of WRF, was early rec ognized for its ability to degrade 
Remazol Brilliant Blue R (Vyas and Moli toris, 1995).  Out of 103 WRF strains, Pleurotus  
 8 
ostreatus  was found to be one of the top fungi to decolorize different dyes (Novotny et al., 2001).  
Cao also found that Pleurotus ostreatus  as one of the most effectiv e decolorizers of the nine 
WRF he studied (Cao, 2000).  
Recent studies have increased the un derstanding of decolorization by Pleurotus ostreatus, 
the enzymes produced, and decolorization or degradation products.  Pleurotus ostreatus has been 
regarded as a fungus belonging to an MnP/laccase group, which means that Pleurotus ostreatus 
does not produce LiP under any conditions (Hata kka, 1994).  The only occasion in which LiP 
was detected in a Pleurotu ostreatus culture came from the study by Robinson and his colleagues 
(Robinson et al., 2001).  In their enzyme assay e xperiments, veratryl alcohol was used as the 
substrate for LiP.  Since both versatile peroxidase (VP) (Hei nfling et al., 1998b)  and veratryl 
alcohol oxidase (VAO) (Sannia et al., 1991) could possibly target ve ratryl alcohol as a substrate, 
the activity detected towards veratryl alcohol does not necessa rily suggest that  LiP is produced 
by Pleurotus ostreatus . In an investigation of decolorization of olive mill wastewater, substantial 
activities of both MnP and laccase were dete cted, whereas no LiP and VAO were detected 
(Aggelis et al., 2002). Early measurements of laccas e activity were highly correlated with the 
final reduction of phenolic com pounds in the wastewater.  Howeve r, in another study on removal 
of phenolic pollutants by Pleurotus ostreatus , only laccase was detecte d.  Hou’s study also found 
that laccase was the only ligni nolytic activity detected in the culture supernatant when 
decolorization of anthraquinone dye  took place in the presence of Pleurotus ostreatus (Hou et al., 
2004).

1.4 Parameters that effect the decolorization or degradation of textile dyes by WRF         
 Parameters such as pH, agitation and te mperature can influence fungal physiology and 
the expression and activity of en zymes therefore affecting their efficiency to decolorize or 
degrade various organic pollutants, in cluding dyes in textile waste water.  
 
1.4.1 The effect of pH on decolorization or degradation of te xtile dyes by WRF 
As one of the most important parameters for preparation of fungal decolorization culture, 
the effect of pH has been studie d for many WRF.  However, most of the attention has been paid 
to find the optimum pH to obtain highest activity towards certain s ubstrates when using isolated 
enzymes.  Research has shown such optimum pH ’s are both enzyme-dependent and substrate-
dependent. Laccase from Coriolus hirsutus  can achieve a highest ac tivity toward ABTS [2,2'-
azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6- sulphonic acid)] at about 2.5, wh ile pH 4 was favored when 
DMP (2,6-dimethoxyphenol) was used as substrate (Shin, K. S. and Lee, Y. J., 2000).  MnP from 
Lentinula edodes was shown to be quite stable in a broad pH range (4.0-6.0) with an optimum 
pH value of 4.5 toward substrate DMP (Boer, C. G. et al. , 2006).  When MBTH (3-methyl- 
2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone) and DMAB (3,3- dimethylaminobenzoic acid) were used as 
substrates, the MnP produced by Irpex lacteus preferred an optimum pH of 5.5-6.5. (Baborova, 
P. et al., 2006).   The effect of initial pH on the enzyme production and degradation of pollutants, 
including textile dyes, has been investigated by a few studies.  In most of these studies, the final 
pH after decolorization or degr adation differed from the initial values.  In the case of 
decolorization of dye Poly R478 by five Zimbabw ean WRF’s, all fungal cu ltures showed small 
but consistent movement toward the optimum pH’s (Tekere, M. et al., 2001). Radha’s study also 
demonstrated that Phanerochaete chrysosporium  cultures with different in itial pH values all fell 
 10 
in the range of 4.5 to 5 after maximum decolorizati ons were reached (Radha, K. V. et al., 2005).   
Production of some organic acids in many WRF secondary metabolis ms can partially contribute 
to the pH self-adjustment by WRF (Wesenberg, D. et al., 2003). For instan ce, oxalic acid is often 
found to be produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium  as one of the small molecular weight 
mediators in its metabolism, which can lead to  a pH decrease in th e culture. However, 
productions of such organic acid s are also restrained by the enzymes from WRF.  LiP and MnP 
from Phanerochaete chrysosporium  can help to decarboxylate oxa late upon catalysis, therefore 
preventing the excess accumulation of oxalate from interrupting the growth of hyphae (Makela, 
M. et. al., 2002, Popp, J. L. et. al ., 1990, Akamatsu, Y., et al., 1990).  
 
1.4.2 The effect of agitation on decolorization  or degradation of textile dyes by WRF 
The decolorization culture can be incubated under either st atic or agitated conditions. 
Wesenberg stated that, in general, production of two major enzymes from WRF, LiP and MnP, is 
generally optimal at high oxygen concentrations but is repressed by agitation in a submerged 
WRF liquid culture, while laccase production is ofte n enhanced by agitation (Wesenberg et al, 
2003). Static culture conditions have been reported to be necessary for the expression of the ligninolytic enzymes in Trametes Versicolor , Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and Pleurotus 
ostreatus  (Haapala, R and Linko, S. 1993, Johansson, T. and Nyman, P. O., 1987, Kim et al, 
1996).  Nevertheless, agitated cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and Trametes  
Versicolor  have decolorized pulp and olive mill effluent s (Michel, F. C. et al., 1991, Sayadi, S. 
and Ellouz R., 1995). When incubated statically, WRF culture often form “mats” at the surface 
of growth medium.  Such culture gave very little  decolorization in both Jarosz et al’s (2002) and 
Swamy’s research (1999). When screening 115 fungi  for their ability to decolorize Basic Blue 22 
 11 
and Acid Red 183, Jarosz and his colleagues found that agitation wa s crucial to archieve a high 
level of decolorization by three se lected fungi.  In Swamy’s study, cultures statically incubated 
only showed decolorization due to adsorption, while  cultures initially inc ubated under agitation 
decolorized the dyes rapidly. Furthermore, in th e same study, if a 10 day old static culture was 
agitated, the mycelium mat transformed into pellets  and then an increase of decolorization was 
observed. Soares and Duran (1998) also reported that agitation was essential for achieving high 
rate of decolorization by WRF Trametes villosa .  Glenn and Gold ( 1983) investigated the 
decolorization of several polymeric dyes by WR F, and they found that agitation was decisive 
too.  The significantly higher deco lorization efficiency of agitated cultures over static cultures 
was mainly due to the increased mass transfer between cells and the me dium along with higher 
oxygen concentration in cultures (Swamy J. and Ramsay, J. A., 1999, Glenn and Gold, 1983).  
However, the effect of agitation on decolori zation depends not only on fungi species and 
enzyme production but also  on dye structures.  Ha et al (2001) reported the effect of agitation 
and oxygen upon the production of  MnP and Laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus .  Agitation 
greatly increased the production of MnP isozymes and triggered the formation of homologous 
pellets in culture, while not much differen ce in laccase production was observed between 
agitated and static cultures.  The higher product ion of MnP in agitation cultures over static ones 
was considered primarily due to  the higher oxygen concentration.  A level of over 5 ppm of 
oxygen was necessary for MnP production.  Nevertheless, in a study using Dichomitus squalens , 
Ischnoderma resinosum  and Pleurotus calyptratus  to decolorize Orange G and RBBR (Remazol 
Brilliant Blue R) (Eichlerova et al, 2005), shak en cultivation substan tially inhibited laccase 
production for Ischnoderma resinosum  and Pleurotus calyptratus  for both dyes, while MnP 
production was not affected.  Laccase activity also decreased in Dichomitus squalens grown in a 
 12 
shaken culture in the presence of RBBR but increas ed in the presence of Orange G. The activity 
of MnP in Dichomitus squalens  cultivated in the shaken culture  decreased in the presence of both 
dyes.  Definite conclusions have not yet been made about the enzymatic  mechanism responsible 
for decolorization by WRF. One strain can use di fferent mechanisms for the decolorization of 
different dyes (Eichlerova et al , 2005). Even though the ligninolytic degradation system of WRF 
has been believed to apply to the degradation of many xenobiotics (Wesenberg et al, 2003), the 
complexity of such degradations and involvement of many factors other than enzymes, such as 
free radicals, mediators, hydroge n peroxide, etc. have to be  recognized and understood 
(Kotterman et al., 1996 , Kapich et al., 1999  and Wesenberg et al, 2003). 
 
1.4.3 The effect of temperature on decolorization  or degradation of textile dyes by WRF 
Different fungi have different optimal growth temperatures.  Most of them grow at 25ºC, 
30ºC or 35 ºC (Fu, Y., and Viraraghavan, T., 2001) .  In the decolorization of Astrazon Red FBL 
by Funalia trogii , Yesilada and colleagues (2002) found that  30ºC was the optimal temperature, 
while 35 ºC was proved to be the optimal temperat ure when several dyes in different structure 
classes were decolorized by Phanerochaete chrysosporium  (Radha, K. V. et al., 2005).  Ten 
types of WRF from semi-tropical forests were studied for their potential to decolorize dyes. 
Their optimum growth temperatures were determin ed to range from 25 ºC to 37 ºC, with each 
fungus having its individual optimum temp erature (Tekere, M. et al., 2001).  
 
1.5 Identification of decolorization or degradation products from textile dyes 
As is known, decolorization or degradation of  dyes may generate products more toxic 
than original dyes; therefore the degradation products from dyes should be investigated.  
 13 
However, past studies have mostly focused on pr oving the ability of WRF to decolorize textile 
dyes and finding out the corresponding enzymes, ra ther than identifying the decolorization or 
degradation products.  
Spadaro and Renganathan (1999) discovered a major product, acetanilide, from the 
degradation of Disperse Yellow 3.  This dye was later studied by Zhao and Hardin (2006), and 
the same product was found in the degradation by Pleurotus ostreatus .  In the case of indigo 
degradation by Trametes Hirsuta  and Sclerotium rolfsii , anthranilic acid was identified as the 
major product (Campos R. et al., 2001).  Among the few studies of the identification of 
degradation products of dyes by WRF, Zhao’s work  has established a relatively complete profile 
of routine procedures to analyze degradation products by GC/MS, HPLC and CE/MS (Zhao, X. 
et al, 2006, Zhao X. and Hardin, Ian R., 2006).  Th e degradations of model compounds Disperse 
Orange 3 and Disperse Yellow 3 were studied.  Nitrobenzene, 4- nitrophenol and 4-nitroaniline 
were identified as three major products from Di sperse Orange 3, while acetanilide was found as a 
major product from the degradation of Di sperse Yellow 3.  In addition, 1-methoxy-4-
nitrobenzene was found transformed from 4-nitrophenol through a methylation step (Zhao, X. et 
al, 2006, Zhao X. and Hardin, I .R., 2006). Such meth lyation reactions were also observed in the 
degradation of 3,4-dichlorophenol by  Phanerochaete chysosporium  (Deschler, C. et al., 1998). 
Valli et al, (1992) reported similar methylation reactions in their study on degradation of 2,4-
dinitrotoluene by Phanerochaete chysosporium ; however, demethylation of the intermediate 
compounds, 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitroben zene was also discovered.  
Even though decolorization or degradation of  textile dyes by WRF has been extensively 
studied, knowledge on how culture parameters affect the fungi gr owth and therefore influence 
their efficiency or ability to decolorize and degr ade textile dye is still fragmented.  The specific 
 14 
mechanism of such decolorization or degradat ion and the thorough pathway from dye to total 
mineralization are still not fully understood. Much more work has to be done in the future to find 
the answers.  
 
1.6 Objectives of study. 
1. Three water soluble dyes, Or ange II, Acid Red 29 a nd Remazol Brilliant Blue, 
were used to study influen ce of buffer, pH, temperat ure and agitation on fungal 
growth and fungus’ ability for decoloriza tion.  The optimal culture parameters 
were to be established and then used for the degradations of five 
nitrophenylazophenylamine azo dyes.   
2. Five model nitrophenylazophenylamine dye s, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Red 
19, Disperse Orange 1, Disperse Or ange 25 and Disperse Red 13, were 
degraded by Pleurotus ostreatus . GC/MS (Gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry) and HPLC (High perfor mance liquid chromatography) were 
used to identify the degrad ation products from the fi ve dyes.  Research was 
also done to study how the initial dye  concentration might affect the 
degradation results.  The degradation pathway of the dyes was explained. 
3. Further breakdown of the major degr adation products from the dyes was 
studied in detail.  The possible effect  of initial concen tration of compounds 
was also studied.  The pathway of the degradation of the major products was 
explained.

2.1.2 Filters  
Three types of filters were tested for the pos sible adsorption of the water soluble dyes and 
degradation products from hydrophobic dyes.  They were nylon (polyamide), PVDF 
(polyvinylidene fluoride) and PTFE (polytetrafluor oethylene) filters.  For three water soluble 
dyes, the color of dye solutions (0.1g/L) was m easured by a spectrophotometer before and after 
filtration with the three types of filters.  Standard solutions (0.1g/ L) of four possible degradation 
products, nitrobenzene, 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroaniline and 4-nitroa nisole were prepared with 
methanol/ water (50/50).  The solutions were filtered with three t ypes of filters.  The 
concentrations of the solutions, before and afte r filtration, were determined on a HPLC system, 
which is described in detail in the “methods ” section.  The nylon filter showed apparent 
adsorption of dyes, while the PVDF and PTFE fi lters exhibited very little dye adsorption.  
 19 
Likewise, nylon filters retained a great amount of  the four possible degradation products, while 
both PVDF and PTFE showed very little adsorpti on.  Therefore, the nylon filter was eliminated. 
PVDF was finally chosen over PTFE because of the lower price and higher hydrophilicity.

2.1.3 Microorganism 
Pleurotus ostreatus (Florida strain), was used in this  study.  This fungus was obtained from 
the Dr. Karl-Erik Eriksson’s laboratory at the University of Georgia. The culture was maintained 
on malt agar plates (malt extract 20 g/L, agar 15  g/L) at 30°C in a temperature chamber.  The 
fungus was subcultured every five days when the mycelium growth reached the edge of the agar 
plate. 
 
2.1.4 Preparation of the decolorization and degradation culture 
An entire 5 days old agar pl ate of fungus was added into 200 ml Kirk’s Medium (Table 2.3) 
and blended to reach homogeneity by a bio-homogenizer (Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK).  Five ml of the homogenous mixture was added to a 125 ml autocl aved Kirk’s medium 
aliquot.  The pH value was adjusted to 5.0 with acetic acid and sodi um hydroxide in an 
 20 
Erlenmeyer flask.  In this study of the effect of different initial pH on decolorization of three 
water soluble dyes, pH 3, 4 and 5 solutions we re prepared with a cetic acid and sodium 
hydroxide, while pH 6 and 7 solutions were pr epared with potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 
sodium hydroxide.  Cultures were incubated at 30ºC and 200 rpm for 3 days before the addition 
of dyes or other compounds.

2.2 Methods 
2.2.1 Decolorization of three water soluble dyes 
Stock dye solutions were prepared at 4g/l.  After 3 days incubation of cultures, 3.3 ml of 
dye stock solution was added to the culture to give an initial  concentration of 100 ppm. The 
temperature and shaking speed were fixed to 30ºC and 150 rpm after the addition of dyes. 
Controls were carried ou t without dyes or fungus. 
 
2.2.2 Degradation of the five hydrophobic az o dyes and their degradation products 
Well-grounded powders of the dyes or  product compounds were weighed on a 
microbalance and added to the grown culture.  Th e temperature and shaking speed were fixed to 
30ºC and 150 rpm after the additio n of dyes.  Controls were ca rried out without dyes, product 
compounds or fungus. 
 
2.2.3 The pH measurements of fungal cultures 
The pH values of fungal cultu res during incubation and decolorization were measured 
every 24 hours with a pH meter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., CA). 
 
2.2.4 Color measurement for decolorization of three water soluble dyes  
Two ml of decolorization culture was sample d and filtered with a 0.45µm PVDF filter. 
One ml of filtrate was mixed with 1 ml of deionized water and the color was measured on a 
spectrophotometer (Shimazu, UV-2401PC). The area under the absorption cu rve in the visible 
range, from 300nm to 700nm, was recorded. All repor ted results were based on 2 or 3 replicates. 
 
 22 
2.2.5 Bioadsorption of three water soluble dyes on the fungal mass 
After 3 days incubation, the fungal cultures we re autoclaved.  Stock solutions of three 
ionic dyes were added into the autoclaved cultures to give an initial dye concentration of 
100ppm.  The cultures were shaken at 150ppm for 10 minutes, and the color of these cultures 
was measured on a spectrophotometer for the star ting color.  Then, the color of cultures was 
measured 24, 48 and 72 hours after the dye addi tion.  Color reduction in the cultures was 
considered to represent the bioa dsoprtion of the dyes on the fungal mass.  The results were based 
on three replicates. 
  
2.2.6 High performance liquid chromatography (HPL C) analysis of the degradation of five 
hydrophobic azo dyes 
One ml of degradation culture was taken an d filtered with a 0.45µm PVDF filter.  The 
filtrate was maintained in sealed sample vial.  Analysis by a Hewlett-P ackard 1100 series HPLC 
system (Hewlett-Packard GmbH, Germany), c onsisting of a model G1 311A quaternary pump, 
G1322A degasser, and a diode array detector (Model G1315A). HP ChemStation software (version B.01.03) was used for data processing and reporting.  The injection volume was set to at 
100µl with an automatic injector (Model 1313A).  The flow rate was held at 1 ml/min during the 
run. The HPLC program is presented in Table 2.4.  Each analyte was monitored at its maximum 
absorption wavelength and the peak area was us ed to represent the amount of the compound.

The identification of products was done by th e comparison of retenti on time and UV spectrum 
with standard compounds. The results  were based on three replicates. 
 
2.2.7 Gas chromatography/mass spectro metry (GC/MS) anaylsis of the  degradation of five 
hydrophobic azo dyes 
Ten ml of degradation culture was sampled a nd extracted with 20 ml methylene chloride 
three times.  The combined organic layers, approxi mately 60 ml, were concentrated to about 0.5 
ml by a rotation evaporator (BÜCHI, Rotavapor R-124).  
GC/MS was performed with a GC-17A gas chromatograph c oupled with a QP5000 mass 
spectrometer from Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan).  The ionization voltage was 70 eV.  Gas 
chromatography was conducted in the temperat ure-programming mode with a XTI-5 column 
(0.25 mm by 30 m) from Restek (B ellefonte, PA).  The initial column temperature was held at 40 
°C for 4 min, then increased linearly to 270°C at  10 °C/min, and held for 5 min at 270°C.  The 
temperature of the injection port was 275 °C a nd the GC/MS interface was maintained at 290°C. 
Helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.  The injection mode was set to be 
splitless.  Identific ation of degradation products was made  by comparison of retention time and 
fragmentation pattern with standard compounds as well as with mass spectra in the NIST spectral library stored in the computer software (version  1.10 beta, Shimadzu) of the GC/MS.  The results 
were based on 2 or more replicates.

2.2.8 Biomass measurement 
Decolorization culture was filtered through  pre-weighed wool glass under reduced 
pressure.  Fungal pellets were retained on glass wool and dried in an ov en at 90°C for 48 hours. 
The dried mass was measured on a balance. Th e results were based on three replicates. 
 
2.2.9 Protein concentration 
Bradford reagent was used to determine th e protein concentration in cultures.  The 
Reaction mixture was composed of 1ml Bradford reagent and 1ml sample filtrate or standard 
protein solution.  The mixture was vigorously shaken and kept still for 15 min before the 
measurement. The protein concentration was dete rmined by the absorption of reaction mixture at 
595nm (Sigma, Product specification, 2006).  The calibration curve was plotted by measuring 
BSA ( Bovine serum albumin) standard solutions at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 µg /l.  The results were 
based on three replicates. 
 
2.2.10 Enzyme activity assay 
Three enzyme assays were performed target ing the possible existing enzymes in the 
culture.  They were LiP (lignin peroxidase), MnP (manganese peroxidase) and laccase.  LiP 
assay mixture contained 1ml of 100 mM sodium tartrate buffer (pH 3.0), 0.5 ml of 10mM 
veratryl alcohol, 0.5 ml of 2mM hyd rogen peroxide and 1ml of cultu re filtrate.  Reaction started 
with the addition of hy drogen peroxide.  The increase of absorption was monitored at 310nm 
(extinction coefficient = 9300 cm-1 M-1).  The assay of versatile peroxidase (VA) was done using 
the same reaction mixture but without hydrogen peroxide.  
 25 
The MnP assay mixture contained 0.5 ml of 10 mM manganese sulfat e, 0.5 ml of 2 mM 
hydrogen peroxide, 1 ml of 100 mM sodium malonate buffer (pH 4.5) and 1 ml of culture 
filtrate. The reaction was started with the addition of hydrogen peroxide.  The increase of absorption was monitored at 270 nm (extinction coefficient = 11590 cm
-1 M-1). 
The laccase assay mixture contained 0.5 ml of ABTS solution, 1.5 ml  of 100 mM sodium 
acetate buffer, 1ml of culture filtrate. The react ion was started with the addition of ABTS. The 
increase of absorption was monitored at  420 nm (extinction coefficient = 36000 cm-1 M-1).  In all 
three assays, the initial linear portion of the tim e-absorption curve was used to calculate the 
enzyme activity. One unit of activity is defined as  the amount of enzyme that can convert 1µ mol 
substrate per minute. All results were based on three replicates. 
 
2.2.11 ANOVA analysis 
ANOVA single factor analysis was performed on the 3rd day decolorization data for the 
three water soluble dyes to determine if buffer, initial pH, agitation and temperature had a significant influence on decolorization rate.  When the P-value is larger than 0.05, it is concluded 
that the corresponding parameter does not have a significant effect on de colorization.  If a P-
value is less than 0.05, then it is concluded that the culture parameter has a significant effect on 
decolorization.

CHAPTER 3 
THE EFFECT OF CULTURE PARAM ETERS ON DECOLORIZATION OF  
THREE WATER SOLUBLE DYES 
 Research has shown that buffer, pH, agitati on and temperature play significant roles in 
fungal growth and subsequent decolorization or degradation.   In this study, the five 
nitrophenylazophenylamine dyes are all sparingly soluble in wa ter, which makes it quite 
complicated to measure the actua l amount of dye that is degrad ed.  Therefore, three water 
soluble dyes, Orange II, Acid Red 29 and Remazol Br illiant Blue R were used to study the effect 
of buffer, pH, agitation and temperature on fungal growth and fungus’ ability  for decolorization.  
Previous study in ou r group has shown that Pleurotus ostreatus  can effectively decolorize these 
three dyes, and the effect of the culture pr eparation parameters can be easily shown by 
monitoring the decolorization rates.  The op timal degradation conditions was established 
according to the results of the decolorization of th e three water soluble dyes and then used for the 
degradation of five nitrophenylazophenylamine azo dyes, which is discussed in Chapter 4. 
 
3.1 Buffer concentration in culture a nd its influence on decolorization. 
Various fungi have been found to be able to produce mediators, often organic acids, 
during their metabolic cycles.  Due to, but not limited to, the existe nce of these organic acids, the 
pH of the fungal cultures change during decolori zation or degradation.  Therefore, the initial 
buffer concentration of the fungal culture can grea tly affect the decolorization or degradation by 
influencing the extent that the cu lture needs adjustment of the pH. 
 27 
In the preparation of the Pleurotus ostreatus  culture, different am ounts of acetic acid 
were added.  Sodium hydroxide solution was used to titrate the cultures to  pH 5.  Cultures with 
different buffer concentrations were prepared.  The buffer concen trations studied were 0, 10 mM, 
20 mM and 30mM.  All three water soluble dye s were studied for the influence of buffer 
concentration on their decolori zations. Color measurement was taken every 24 hours till the 
seventh day.  The initial dye concentration of  Orange II was 100 ppm.  The pH values were 
monitored from the first day of incubation, and are presented in Figure 3.1.  Color measurement 
began after the addition of dye, which was afte r 3 days culture incubation (Figure 3.2).   
The cultures without buffer did not give any decolorization, and pH’s  dropped rapidly to 
about 3.0 after 3 days incubation.  A pH between  4 and 5 has been considered optimal for 
enzymes from Pleurotus ostreatus to function.  Thus, given a pH as low as 3, the culture with no 
buffer was not able to either produce any enzymes or provide a suitable pH level for enzymes to 
work.  Cultures having 10 mM buffer removed a bout 90 percent of the color within 3 days. 
Surprisingly, an increase followed by a significant decrease in pH value was seen in cultures having 10 mM buffer during the in cubation.  However, an explanation of such phenomenon 
could not be given.  Cultures wi th 20 mM buffer exhibited the sa me efficiency in decolorization 
as those with 10 mM buffer, but without same va riation in pH.  Culture s having 30 mM buffer 
eventually achieved about 90 percent color remo val after 4 days, which was one day more than 
cultures with 10 mM and 20 mM buffers.  This is possibly due to the increased difficulty for the 
fungus to adjust its culture pH under the higher buffer concen tration.  The low degree of

fluctuation of pH in 30 mM bu ffer cultures seems to confirm this.  These results indicated that 
buffer concentration played a significant role  in decolorization of Orange II, which was 
supported by the ANOVA analysis results (ref er to Appendices).  When data for 3 day Orange II 
decolorization cultures with different buffer con centration were tested by ANOVA, a P-value of 
4.44×10-5 was obtained, which indicated that the means of the 3 day decolorization rate were 
significantly different due to different buffer concentration.   
The bio-parameters, including protein conc entration and enzyme activities were 
measured.  The biomass of 10 mM and 20 mM buffe r cultures, which showed a faster rate of 
decolorization than the other tw o, were higher than the othe r two conditions (Table 3.1).  
However, the 30 mM buffer samples, which had the least biomass, still reached a high level of 
decolorization.  The protein concen trations of 10 mM and 20 mM buffer samples were about half 
of that of 30 mM cultures after 7 days decolori zation, but their ability to decolorize Orange II 
was apparently stronger, es pecially within the first 3 days of decolorization

Both MnP and laccase activities were detected in all cultures that had buffers, regardless 
of the concentration.  However, no clear correl ation was found between th e decolorization rate 
 30 
and level of enzyme activities.  Ten mM buffe r samples produced much more MnP and laccase 
than 20mM buffer samples.  Nevertheless, ther e was no obvious difference between these two in 
decolorization rate, and the highe st level of MnP and second hi ghest laccase activity did not 
cause the 30 mM buffer to give the faster de colorization.  Since these bio-parameters were 
measured after 7 days of decolorization, they  may not reflect the actual changes of bio-
parameters during the whole peri od.  But due to the limited capaci ty of our shakers and amount 
of culture aliquot for sampli ng, we did not sample the deco lorization cultures for daily 
measurement of bio-parameters.  
According to a previous report, Pleurotus ostreatus does not produce LiP (Wesenberg et 
al, 2003).  Using the veratryl alcohol and hydr ogen peroxide assay, we detected the “LiP” 
activity.  However, this did not necessa rily indicate that LiP was produced by Pleurotus 
ostreatus .  Since both the VP (Heinf ling, et al., 1998b) and veratr yl alcohol oxidase (VAO) 
(Sannia et al., 1991) could likely take veratryl alcohol as their substrate even without hydrogen 
peroxide, the activity detected towards veratryl alcohol does not definitely mean that LiP was 
produced by Pleurotus ostreatus .   In the 7 day decolorization cu ltures (10mM buffer) of Orange

II samples, we did detect about 16 U/L activity to wards veratryl alcohol without the presence of 
hydrogen peroxide.  Later, a commercially available laccase from Trametes versicolor was used 
 31 
to test the possible activity of laccase toward s LiP and MnP assays.  Th e results (Table 3.2) 
showed that laccase from Trametes versicolor  clearly showed activity in the veratryl alcohol- 
hydrogen peroxide assay, but  no activity in the MnP assay as we  used.  Therefore, the detected 
LiP activity was possibly due to the existence of VP or VAO and the interference from laccase in 
the Pleurotus ostreatus  cultures. 
When pH values and color removal were mon itored during decoloriza tion of Acid Red 29 
in cultures with different buffer concentrations , results similar to those of Orange II were 
obtained (Figure 3.3 and 3.4).   A P-value of 1.41×10-6 was calculated when the 3 day 
decolorization rate of Acid Red 29 was tested (refer to Appendices).   This indicated, as in the 
case of Orange II, that buffer concentration can significantly influence the decolorization of Acid 
Red 29.

A considerable pH decrease was shown for cultures without buffer, and such cultures 
again did not successfully decolorize the dye . Cultures having 10 mM and 20 mM buffer all 
showed great degree of decolorization, whil e 10 mM ones presented a slightly faster 
decolorization rate over 20 mM one s.  Unlike the case of Orange II, cultures with 30 mM buffer 
could only remove about 30 percent of the tota l color even after 7 days decolorization.

Bio-parameters were also measured for 7 day Acid Red 29 decolo rization cultures with 
different buffer concentrations (Table 3.3). Ten mM and 20 mM buffer samples gave the highest 
biomass in accordance with the fastest rates of decolorization.  However, 30 mM buffer samples 
had the highest protein concentrations but did not achieve satisfactory decolorization.  The results of the enzyme assays did not provide a clear explanation of the relationship between 
enzyme production and decolorization.  Even t hough the fastest decolorizing cultures were the 
 33 
ones that had the most enzymes, the second fastest decolorized culture s with 20 mM buffer 
exhibited only slight MnP acitivi ty.  As discussed earlier, the LiP acitivity detected did not 
necessarily indicate the existence of LiP in the Pleurotus ostreatus  culture.

Comparing the results for Or ange II and Acid Red 29, it was found that 10 mM and 20 
mM buffer concentrations gave the best d ecolorizations.  Cultures without buffer did not 
decolorize either dye at all.  A 30 mM buffer cultu re decolorized more than  90 percent of Orange 
II but less than 40 percent of Acid Red 29.  A de finite relationship coul d not be found between 
enzyme production and decolorization efficien cy.  The enzyme production for Acid Red 29 
cultures was much lower than in Orange II decolorization cultures.  However, substantial 
decolorization of Acid Red 29 st ill occurred in the 10 mM and 20 mM buffer cultures, even 
though the 20 mM buffer culture produced very li ttle MnP while decolorizing Acid Red 29.  
These decolorization and bio-pa rameters results again illustrated the complexity of the 
ligninolytic fungal degradation system.  The li gninolytic enzymes were not the only factor 
involved.  Many other factors, su ch as mediators, hydrogen pe roxide, oxygen concentration all 
 34 
play important roles in such decolorization systems.   Experiments were also carried out to isolate 
the enzymes from the crude decolorization cu ltures by using FPLC and SDS-PAGE.  However, 
the experiments did not produce sati sfactory results.  Due to the l ack of relationship between bio-
parameters and decolorization efficiency, bio-parameters were not measured for the follow-up 
experiments.  Five days were sufficient to show clear differences in the decolorizations under 
different conditions, and the observation peri od was shortened from 7 days to 5 days. 
Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) is one of th e textile dyes that have  extensively studied 
for fungal decolorization, especially for Pleurotus ostreatus.  However, the effect of culture 
preparation parameters on RBBR decolorization ha s not been studied ex tensively.  Figures 3.5 
and 3.6 show the pH values during decolo rization of RBBR under different buffer 
concentrations.    The pH values changes were parallel to those in Acid Red 29 decolorization 
cultures.  Cultures with no buffer gave almost  no decolorization, while 30 mM buffer showed 
very poor decolorization capability.  Twenty mM buffer exhibited the fastest decolorization rate 
among the four conditions.  In spite of a lowe r decolorization rate during the first three days, 
cultures having 10 mM buffer reached same degree of  color removal as 20 mM ones after 4 days.  
A P-value of 4.15×10-5 was obtained (refer to Appendices), wh ich indicated buffer concentration 
played a significant role in  the decolorization of RBBR.

Given these results, it is concluded th at buffer concentration in fungal cultures 
preparation played a very significant role in decolorization ability and efficiency.  Without any 
buffer, the pH of fungal cultures tended to qui ckly decrease to about 3, under which condition 
either no enzymes were produced or the enzymes were not able to work  properly.  High buffer 
concentration was also not preferred as for deco lorization.  This was likely due to the increased 
difficulty for the fungus to adjust  its own growth environment.  Both 10 mM and 20 mM buffers 
were suitable for decolorizati on.  After 4 days, they both reached about same level of 
decolorization.  The pH values of pure cultures  without the addition of dyes at different buffer 
concentration were also recorded. The results sh owed no effect on pH was from the addition of 
dyes (Figure 3.7)

3.2 Effect of initial pH of culture on d ecolorization of three water soluble dyes. 
Major enzymes produced by white rot fungi a ll have optimum pH levels for highest 
activities.  The pH values in  culture preparation indeed e xhibit a significant influence on 
decolorization and degradation by white rot fungi , even though fungi, by themselves, can adjust 
the growth environment to certain degrees.  Therefore, the effect of the initial pH of cultures on 
the decolorization of three water soluble dyes was studied.  Buffers were prepared at 10 mM for 
Orange II and Acid Red 29, while  20 mM buffer were used fo r RBBR according to the results 
discussed in section 3.1. 
As with Orange II, only pH 5 and 7 demons trated satisfactory decolorization, while 
cultures with the initial pH at 3, 4 and 6 did not show more than 10 percent color removal 
(Figure 3.9).  ANOVA analysis  gave a P-value of 2.63×10-10 for 3 day decolorization results, 
which indicated that the initial pH can significantly affect the decolorization rate (refer to Appendices).  In the case of pH 5 and 7, after three days incubation the cultures had reached pH 
values around 5 (Figure 3.8), which was in the optimal range for the enzymes (MnP or/and laccase) from Pleurotus ostreatus to show high activities.  Cultures having an initial pH of 6 
showed a quick decrease in pH within 3 days incubation, a nd the pH did not rise above 4 
afterwards (Figure 3.8).  No apparent pH change s were observed for cultures having initial pH’s 
of 3 and 4.  These results indicated that a pH of 5 was essential for Pleurouts ostreatus  to 
decolorize Orange II.  A high acidi ty, either initially imposed or  being reached after incubation, 
will prohibit a large degree of decolorization.

The results for Acid Red 29 were very simila r to those of Orange II except for pH 6.  
ANOVA analysis gave a P-value of 3.67×10-3 for 3 day decolorization results, which indicated 
that initial pH can significantly affect the deco lorization rate (refer to Appendices).  In the 
experiments for Acid Red 29 (Figure 3.10 and 3.11), cultures with initial pH at 5, 6 and 7 all 
achieved more than 80 percent decolorization af ter 5 days.  Once again, cultures having initial 
pH at 5 and 7 self-stabilized th eir pH after the addition of dye.  Cultures with an initial pH 6 
were not able to reach close to 5 until 5 days after addition of dyes, but a high degree of 
decolorization was obtained.  This was assumed to be partially due to the structural difference between Orange II and Acid Red 29.  However, this assumption has not yet been proved by experiment.  The pH 4 cultures showed about 25 percent color removal after 5 days, which may 
due to bioadsorption of dyes onto fungal mass as in the case of cultures havi ng an initial pH at 5 
(discussed later in section 3.5).

As previously addressed, the proper pH in the fungal cultures is essential to achieve a 
satisfactory decolorzation result.  Both buffer concentration and initial pH in the culture can 
significantly affect the pH during incubation and decolorization.  Th erefore, research is needed 
to find the optimal buffer concentration and optimal initial pH for a fungus concerning specific 
applications.

Pleurotus ostreatus , the appropriate working pH appeared to  be 5 or 7.  The pH 5 was chosen 
over 7 since most of the previous work done by our research group was based on pH 5.  Ten mM 
or 20 Mm sodium acetate buffer is the appropriate  buffer for the decolorization of these three 
dyes.  Buffer at 10mM was chosen over 20mM for th e later study of five azo dyes since it gave 
better decolorization rate for Ac id Red 29 but not for RBBR, whic h has a much less structural 
similarity to the five azo dyes to be studie d.  The complete answers to why and how buffer 
concentration and initial pH a ffect the enzymology of fungi during decolorization cannot be 
given at this point, and mo re research is needed.  
 
3.3 The effect of agitation on decolorization. 
 
Fungal cultures incubation can be done either  statically or under agitation.  Depending 
upon the fungi species, enzymes and the dyes, agitation may or may not promote decolorization 
efficiency.  Kim et al (1996) has described a decrease in RBBR decolorization in a shaken 
culture of Pleurotus ostreatus.  However, Swamy and Ramsay (1999) reported that agitation was 
crucial for decolorization of several dyes by Bjerkandera  sp. BOS55, Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  and Trametes versicolor .  Jarosz et al (2002) also showed that shaken cultures 
gave better decolorization results than static ones .  Ha et al (2001) inve stigated the effect of 
 43 
agitation on fungal pellets growth and producti on of MnP and laccase.  It was found that 
agitation was essential to produce MnP, because of the need for increased oxygen concentration 
in the culture.  However, agitation did not in fluence the laccase production very much.  In a 
study of decolorization of Orange G and RBBR by three white rot fungi, Dichomitus squalens, 
Ishchnoderma resinosum  and Pleurotus calyptratus , the effect of agitati on on decolorization was 
found to depend not only on the fungal species and en zymes, but also on dye types (Eichlerova et 
al, 2005).  Dichomitus squalens showed a comparable decolorizat ion rate under bo th shaken and 
static conditions in spite of the fact that a pparent different levels of MnP and laccase were 
produced.  Ishchnoderma resinosum  and Pleurotus calyptratus  produced much more laccase 
under static condition than under shaken condi tions, while the production of MnP was not 
affected.  However, static cultures of Ishchnoderma resinosum  and Pleurotus calyptratus  gave 
better decolorization than shaken cultures for Orange G but not fo r RBBR.  Therefore, the effect 
of agitation on decolorization cannot be simply categorized as increasing or decreasing 
production of certain types of enzymes.  
In our study, the cultures were incubated and shaken at 150 rpm for 3 days to achieve the 
formation of uniform pellets.  This formation is  considered to be very important for enzyme 
production from Pleurotus ostreatus  for (Ha et al, 2001).  Dye stock solutions were then added. 
In first three days of decolorization, cultures were  kept static in a temperature chamber.  Color 
was measured after the cultures were taken out of the cham ber and shaken at 150 rpm for 10 
minutes.  As can be seen, almost no color was rem oved for all three dyes duri ng the static period.  
After three static days, shaking was started, and decolorization was observed subsequently 
(Figure 3.14).  After 3 days of  agitation, more than 90 percen t of Orange II was decolorized. 
Decolorization was 70 and 60 percen t, respectively, for Acid Red 29 and Remazol Brilliant Blue 
 44 
R.  These results showed that agitation was essential for the decolorization of these three dyes.  
ANOVA analysis of 3rd decolorization data with out and after agitation gave values much smaller 
than 0.05 for all three dyes, which indicated th at agitation was significantly important for 
decolorization of these three wate r soluble dyes (refer to Appendices ).  The first three days of 
static conditions may or may not give a higher level of enzymes production.  However, without 
agitation no reactions to break down dye mol ecules took place.  The decolorization after 
agitation began may due to the improved mass tran sfer and increased o xygen concentration in 
cultures (Ha et al, 2001, Swamy and Ramsay, 1999).  A study on Phanerochaete chrysosporium  
indicated that during lignin degr adation the lignin has to bind to  the fungal wall for effective 
degradation (Kirk and Farrell, 1987), and that  agitation can promote such binding.  If 
decolorization of dyes also require s such binding, agitation can likely give better decolorization 
efficiency.

3.4 The effect of incubation temperature on decolorization of Orange II by Pleurotus 
ostreatus 
Besides buffer concentration and pH of the culture, the incubation temperature can also 
apparently influence the growth of fungal culture, therefore aff ect the decolorization result.  
Orange II was used to test how incubation te mperature may affect the decolorization.  Fungal 
cultures were incubated under 3 different temperat ures, 25 ºC, 30 ºC and 35ºC.  After 3 days 
incubation, stock solutions of Orange II were  added to cultures to give a 100 ppm initial 
concentration.  Decolorization was monitored daily until the fifth day.  At all three temperatures,

substantial decolorization was obs erved after 3 days (Figure 3.15).  The 25 ºC samples showed a 
slower rate of decolorization than 30 ºC and 35 ºC.  After 2 days of decolorization, only 20 
percent of color was removed at 25 ºC, while more than 50 percen t of color was removed at 30ºC 
and 35ºC.   
 46 
Temperature was shown to have significant influence on fungal decolorization with a P-
value of 0.004995 from ANOVA analysis.  Temperatur es at 30 ºC and 35 ºC  appeared to give 
faster decolorization than 25 ºC.  However, when future application is considered, 25 ºC may be 
preferred because of energy concerns.  
 
3.5 Bioadsorption of three water solubl e dyes onto the fungal mass.  
In the decolorization of text ile dyes by white rot fungi, removal of dye from cultures is 
not only due to the actual break-down of dye molecules but also due to th e bio-adsorption of dye 
by the fungal mass.  In order to determine if the high degrees of deco lorization previously 
observed were caused by bioadsorption, cultures (incubated with 10 mM buffer and at pH 5) 
were autoclaved, and dyes were added to see how much adsorption occu rred with dead fungal 
pellets.  The results are shown in Table 3.4. 
Table 3.4 Bioadsorption of three water soluble dyes on fungal mass 
Color Remaining (%)  
Dyes  After 1 day After 2 days After 3 days 
Orange II 79.6 ± 0.4 79.5 ± 1.4 78.3 ± 1.6 
Acid Red 29 96.2 ± 2.2 95.8 ± 2.3 95.7 ± 2.7 
RBBR 90.5 ± 5.7 90.6 ± 5.8 90.8 ± 5.7 
 
As is shown, approximately 20 percent of Or ange II was absorbed  by the dead fungal 
mass within 24 hours of agitation at 150 rpm.  This amount of bioadsorption of Orange II by the dead fungal mass could contribute to the first da y decolorization in a live fungal culture, which 
was also about 20 percent.  Howe ver, extending the agitation tim e to 48 or 72 hours did not show 
further bioadsorption.  This i ndicates that the significant decolo rization seen in live cultures was 
primarily due to the actual break-down of dye molecules by the fungus.  Only 5 percent of the 
color of Acid Red 29 was removed because of bi oadsorption.  The longer time did not increase 
 47 
the bioadsorption.  Thus, almost all of the d ecolorization in cultures having Acid Red 29 was 
primarily due to the fungus’ abil ity to degrade dye molecules.  RBBR showed a higher level of 
bioadsorption degree than Acid Red 29 but lower than Orange II, and about 10 percent of the dye 
was adsorbed by the dead fungal mass.  As was shown earlier, more than 50 percent of RBBR 
was decolorized in a live f ungal culture after 3 days; therefore the great amount of the 
decolorization of RBBR was due to f ungal enzymatic degradation of dye.

CHAPTER 4 
ANALYSIS OF DEGRADATION OF NITROPHENYLAZOPHENYLAMINE DYES BY 
WHITE ROT FUNGUS PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS  
Zhao and Hardin (2006) have developed an analytical profile for analysis of degradation 
of azo dyes by the white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus.  However, questions still remain as to 
whether a dye structurally similar to Disperse Orange 3 will give similar primary degradation 
products (Zhao, 2006), and whether further degradatio n of the primary products will occur.  Five 
nitrophenylazophenylamine dyes, Di sperse Red 1, Disperse Red 19, Disperse Orange 1, Disperse 
Orange 25 and Disperse Red 13 were  studied for their degradation by Pleurotus ostreatus.  The 
possible degradations of the prim ary products were also studied. 
 
4.1 Primary degradation of hydrophobic azo dyes by white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus 
Disperse Red 1 differs from  Disperse Orange 3 only in one end of the molecular 
structure; therefore, it is qu ite possible for Disperse Red 1 to  produce the same primary products 
as those from Disperse Orange 3.  The gas chro matogram showed that the three major products 
from Disperse Orange 3, nitrobenzene, 4-nitro phenol and 4-nitroaniline,  were also produced 
from Disperse Red 1 in the presence of Pleurotus ostreatus .  After 1 day, only veratryl alcohol 
was detected in the culture (Figure 4.1).  Vera tryl alcohol is produced in the secondary 
metabolism cycle of Pleurotus ostreatus, and it is essential in the li gnin peroxidase cycle during 
oxidations of azo dyes (Paszcznski and Crawford, 1991).  However, Pleurotus ostreatus  is 
believed not to produce any LiP (W esenberg et al, 2003).  Veratryl  alcohol can also be oxidized 
 49 
by both Versatile peroxidase (H einfling et al., 1998b) and vera tryl alcohol oxidase (VAO) 
(Sannia et al., 1991) to veratryl aldehyde.  The o ccurrence of veratryl alcohol, therefore did not 
necessarily indicate the existence of LiP.  
      Nitrobenzene, 4-nitrophenol and 4-nitroa niline were detected in the 4 day degradation 
culture (Figure 4.2).  Furthermore, 4-nitroa nisole, a product from 4-nitrophenol through a 
methylation step, was also de tected.  Such methylation wa s reported by Zhao (2006) for 
Pleurotus ostreatus, and methylation of phenolic  compounds by another fungus Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium , has also been reported (Valli and Gold, 1991; Valli et al., 1992).  The gas 
chromatogram of the 7 days degradation cultur e also showed the three primary products and 4-
nitroanisole as well (Figure 4.3) .  These compounds were not det ected in the control sample 
(Figure 4.4).

The 7 day degradation sample was also analyzed by HPLC; the signal was monitored at 5 
different wavelengths, the maximum absorption wavelengths for the possible products.  The 
results also confirmed that the same three pr oducts were produced fr om Disperse Red 1 and 
Disperse Orange 3 (Figure 4.5), and they were not detected in the pure cultu re (Figure 4.6).  It is 
believed that both nitrobenzen e and 4-nitrophenol can be generated from the unstable 
intermediate, 4-nitrophenyldiazene, which can then form a free radical at the para-position to the 
nitro group on the benzene ring by loss of nitr ogen.  This free radical can further accept a 
hydrogen free radical or a hydroxyl free radical to form nitrobenz ene or 4-nitroph enol (Zhao, 
Ph.D dissertation, 2004).  Figure 4.5 shows that another new compound that was found in the 7 
day degradation culture; it was 1,2-dimethoxy- 4-nitrobenzene (retent ion time = 29.385 min, 344 
nm).  A later study of the degradation of 4-nitrophenol showed that 1,2-dimethoxy-4-
nitrobenzene is a possible product from 4-nitrophenol.

Disperse Red 19 has a molecular structure quite similar to that  of Disperse Red 1 with a 
hydrogen replaced by a hydroxyl group at one end of the molecule.  Since Disperse Red 1 can 
produce nitrobenzene, 4-nitrophenol and 4-nitroaniline in  the presence of Pleurotus ostreatus , 
Disperse Red 19 was believed to be able to ge nerate the same 3 major compounds.  In the 
supernatant of the 1 day old culture containi ng Disperse Red 19, 4-nitroaniline was already 
detected, while nitrobenzene and 4-nitrophenol we re not observed (Figure 4.7).  This indicated 
that the generation of 4-nitroaniline is through a different mechanism than that for production of 
nitrobenzene and 4-nitrophenol.  A reductive cleavage is the most likely mode of production of 
4-nitroaniline.  Pinheiro et al  (2004) reported that the az o bond is vulnerable to reductive 
cleavage.  A schematic degradation pathway of Disperse Orange 3 (Zhao, Ph.D dissertation, 
2004) illustrated that a reducti ve cleavage of azo bond is res ponsible for formation of 4- 
nitroaniline, while nitrobenzen e and 4-nitrophenol are likely  products from the unstable 
intermediate, 4-nitrophe nyldiazene.  Chromatograms of th e 4 and 7 day cultures showed the 
formation of nitrobenzene and 4-nitrophenol, al ong with 4-nitroanisole (Figure 4.8 and 4.9). 
Several unknown metabolites were de tected in 7 the day culture.  They were either seen in the 
pure culture or unable to be identified for clear structure information. The HPLC results are well in accordance with the GC/MS results, and 1,2- dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene was again detected 
(Figure 4.10).

Given the results of Disperse Red 1 and Disp erse Red 19, it is concluded that an azo dye 
having its partial structure the same as the stru cture shown in Figure 4.11 is quite likely to be 
capable of the production of three major products in the presence of Pleurotus ostreatus .

Figure 4.11 A structure shared by the five hydrophobic azo dyes being studied in this research 
 
Disperse Orange 1 and Disperse Orange 25 both fall into the group of azo dyes having 
such a structure in their molecules.   Therefore, it is not unreasonable to pred ict that nitrobenzene, 
4-nitrophenol and 4-nitroaniline will be produced by both of these dyes.

Like Disperse Red 19, the 1 day degradation culture only showed the formation of 4-
nitroaniline (Figure 4.12), whic h once again indicated that the production of 4-nitroaniline was 
through a different mechanism than that responsible for production of nitrobenzene and 4-
nitrophenol. Gas chromatograms of 4 and 7 day cu ltures clearly illustrated the formation of 
nitrobenzene and 4-nitrophenol (Figure 4.13 and 4.14).  The 4-nitroanisole was only detected in 4 day old culture by GC/MS, but the HPLC chro matogram showed that 4-nitroanisole also 
existed in the 7 day culture, though in extremely low amount (Figure 4.15).

The 1 day old culture contai ning Disperse Orange 25 did not show any degradation 
products beside veratryl alcohol  (Figure 4.16).  Nitrobenzene was detected in  the 4 day culture 
(Figure 4.17).  However, the chromatogram of  the 7 day culture (Figure 4.18) showed the 
formation of three primary products.  Like Disp erse Orange 1, very little 4-nitroanisole was 
produced. Nevertheless, the SIC (selected ion chromatogram) display along with the HPLC 
chromatogram confirmed the production of 4-nitroa nisole.  SIC can be us ed to display only the 
signals from certain ions that ar e selected by their mass over char ge values.  Compounds that do 
not produce the selected ions will not be displa yed in the chromatogram.  The molecular ion of 
4-nitroanisole has a m/z value at 153; therefore m/z 153 was chos en to display the compounds 
capable of producing such an ion.  A peak at 15.522 min was assigned to 4-nitroanisole due to 
the same mass spectrum and retent ion time as to standa rd 4-nitroanisole (Figure 4.19).  Another 
peak at 17.079 min was assigned to veratryl alcohol, which can also  generate ions at m/z 153.

The HPLC chromatogram (Figure 4.20) of 7 da y degradation culture clearly illustrated 
the production of 4-nitroaniline at 31.257min (313 nm), along with the 3 primary products, 
nitrobenzene, 4-nitrophenol and 4-nitroaniline.  The signal at  344nm showed the production of 
1,2-dimethoxy-4- nitrobenzene, which has been pr eviously detected in Disperse Red 1 and 
Disperse Red 19 degradation cultur es.  Based on the analysis of degradation of Disperse Red 1, 
Disperse Red 19, Disperse Ora nge 1 and Disperse Orange 25, a early stage of degradation 
pathway of these azo dyes was proposed (Figure 4.21).  It is believed that such a pathway can 
apply to many azo dyes having a stru cture similar to model compound I.   A reductive cleavage 
can give birth to 4-nitroanili ne.  The unstable intermediate 4-nitrophenyldiazen e eventually 
transforms into nitrobenzene or 4-nitrophenol, wh ich can further transform into 4-nitroanisole. 
Another azo dye, Disperse Red 13 differs from  Disperse Red 1 only in the addition of a 
chloro group at the meta position of the azo bond on the benzene ring ha ving a nitro group.  This 
dye was chosen to see whether the addition of a chloro group would affect the pattern of dye 
degradation molecule by Pleurotus ostreatus .  In 1 day degradation cu lture, only veratryl alcohol 
was detected, as well as a metabolite at 19.333min whose structure could not be identified 
(Figure 4.22).  The gas chromatograms of both 4 and 7 day degradation cultures illustrated that 
1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline were produced from Disperse Red 13 (Figure 4.23 and 4.24).  This indica ted that Disperse Red 13 also follows the degradation pattern 
presented in Figure 4.19.  However, if the de gradation of Disperse  Red 13 was in exact 
accordance with the pathway shown in Figure 4.21, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol should have been produced and further produced 2- chloro-4-nitranisole.  In fact, 2-chloro-4-nitroanisole was

detected in the 4 and 7 day cult ures, but these cultures  contained no 2-chloro -4-nitrophenol.  This 
indicates that methylation may not be the only mechanism through which nitroanisole was 
produced.  In the transformati on of the unstable intermedia te 4-nitrophenyldiazene to 
nitrobenzene and 4-nitrophenol, a key step is for 4-nitrophenyl diazene to lose a nitrogen 
molecule and form a free radical that is able to accept either hydrogen or  hydroxyl free radical to 
form nitrobenzene or 4-nitrophenol in later r eactions (Figure 4.21). Likewise, a corresponding 
intermediate, 2-chloro-4- nitrophenyldiazene could al so occur in the degradation of Disperse Red 
13.  This compound, like 4-nitrophenyldiazene, can lose a nitrogen molecule to form a free 
radical and further accept a met hoxyl free radical to directly pr oduce 2-chloro-4-nitroanisole. It 
is suggested that production of 4- nitroanisole in Disperse Red 1 degradation culture may also be 
due to acceptance of methoxy free radical to the intermediate 4-nitrophenyldiazene rather than 
merely due to methylat ion of 4-nitrophenol. 
 66 
The SIC display at m/z 173 and175 (the molecular ion and A+2 ion) confirmed that 2-
chloro-4-nitrophenol was not produced from Disperse Red 13 since the retention time did not 
correspond to that of 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol (Figure 4.25).  The existence of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene was proved by the signal of ion m/z 183 ( the molecular ion
 ) at 18.602 min.  This 
indicated that 4-nitrophenol may not be the only source of the production of this compound. The 
peak at 29.619 min in HPLC chromatogram at 316 nm also demonstrated the existence of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene in the degrad ation culture of Disperse Red 13.

4.2 The influence of initial dye concentrat ion on degradation of Disperse Red 1 by 
Pleurotus ostreatus  
In order to test how the initial dye concen tration of Disperse Red 1 can influence the 
degradation results, three initia l dye concentrations, 50 ppm, 100 ppm and 200 ppm were tested.   
The amounts of three major products, nitrobenzene, 4-nitroaniline and 4-nitrophenol along with 
4-nitroanisole were quantitatively monitored by HPLC. 
The dye concentration did not significantly affect the prod uction of nitrobenzene from 
Disperse Red 1 (Figure 4.27).  Cu ltures having different initial dy e concentrations all showed a 
constant increase of nitrobenzene, and there was no obvious difference between the cultures in 
 68 
terms of nitrobenzene concentration. The constant increase of n itrobenzene indicated 
nitrobenzene may not be further degraded by the fungus.

For 4-nitrophenol, higher initia l dye concentrations showed higher levels of 4-nitrophenol 
(Figure 4.28).  For 50 ppm of dye, an obvious decrease was seen after 4 days degradation which 
suggested that 4-nitrophenol may be further degr aded into other compounds.  Such a decrease 
was observed after 5 days for 100 ppm and after 7 days for 200 ppm. It was reasonable that 
cultures having 100 ppm and 200 ppm initial dye concentration exhibited the decrease of 4-
nitrophenol later than for 50 ppm because 100 ppm and 200 ppm had mo re 4-nitrophenol

pesticides etc.  It is probably the most important compound among the mono-nitrophenols that 
cause serious environmental contamination (Donl on et al., 1996, Karin and Gupta, 2002). As for 
biodegradation, most of the work has been done by using 4-nitrophenol as a sole carbon and 
nitrogen source by various bacteria ( Jain et al., 1994 ; Kadiyala et al., 1998 , Bhushan et al., 2000 ; 
Chauhan et al., 2000 , Roldán et al., 1998 ). The reduction of 4-nitrophenol by Pleurotus ostreatus  
is herein reported for the first time.  This suggest s that the white rot fungus  may also be used in 
biodegradation to solve the environmenta l concerns brought a bout by 4-nitrophenol.

Figure 4.29 Production of 4-nitroa niline from Disperse Red 1 
with different initial dye concentrations 
 
 
Figure 4.29 illustrates that the production of 4-ni troaniline is also influenced by the initial 
dye concentration.  Fifty ppm starting dye concen tration showed a decreas e of 4-nitroaniline 
after 4 days degradation, while such a decrease occurred after 6 and 7 days, respectively, for 100 
ppm and 200 ppm starting dye concentrations. As in the case of 4-nitrophenol, more 4-
nitroaniline was produced in the cultures init ially having 100 ppm and 200 ppm dye than in ones 
having 50 ppm dye, therefore much more time was taken for the degradation of 4-nitroaniline 
into descendant compounds to overwhelm the production of 4-nitroaniline and cause its amount 
to decrease. Four-nitroaniline has also b een considered as a serious environmental 
contamination, and it has been detected in a wastewater of the production of azo dyes (Sarasa et al., 1998). However, there are only a few reports of successful e limination or degradation of 4-
nitroaniline in aerobic wastewater treatment processes (Saupe 1999). Instead, physicochemical 
treatments such as ozonization and the photo- Fenton process have been typical means of 
degradation of 4-nitroaniline (Wang and Jin, 1988; Ruppert and Baucer 1993). Saupe (1999) 
 71 
developed a continuous bioreactor  system, in which bacteria collected from a waste water bio-
sludge was fed with 4-nitroaniline as the so le carbon and nitrogen, that achieved a high 
efficiency of degradation of 4-nitroaniline. To date no research has been done using the white rot 
fungus to degrade 4-nitroaniline. The reduction of  4-nitroaniline was observed for all cultures 
having different initial dye concen trations, which indicated that Pleurotus ostreatus  may also be 
employed to achieve a biodegradation of 4-nitroaniline. 
          Regarded as a secondary produc t from 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroanisole may also be 
produced directly from the unstable intermedia te nitrophenyldiazene.  Cultures with 100 ppm 
and 200 ppm illustrated (Figure 4.30) constant increas es of 4-nitroanisole after 2 days, while 50 
ppm showed a decrease in 4-nitroa nisole after 5 days.  This suggested that 4-nitroanisole can be 
degraded by Pleurotus ostreatus .

4.3 Secondary degradation of the primary pr oducts from the hydrophobic azo dyes. 
 
Since we have found that two of the three primary products from Disperse Red 1 could be 
degraded further, experiments were carried out to determine the nature of the degradations. 
 
4.3.1 Secondary degradation of the primary product nitrobenzene 
 
The chromatograms of 1 and 4 day culture s containing only nitrobenzene showed the 
existence of nitrobenzene and veratryl alc ohol (Figure 4.31 and 4.32).  Although the 7 day 
culture gave some additional small peaks at time ranging from 17 to 22 min, their structure 
information was not determined (Figure 4.33).

4.3.1 Secondary degradation of the primary product 4-nitrophenol and the influence of 
initial concentration 
The chromatogram of the 1 day 4-nitrophenol degradation culture clearly showed that 4-
nitroanisole was produced from 4-nitrophenol (Fi gure 4.34). After 4 days degradation, two more 
compounds, 2,4-dinitrophenol (16.967min) and 2,4- nitroanisole (20.119mi n), were detected 
(Figure 4.35).  The source of th e nitro group added onto the benzene ring is still not clear. 
However, in the research done using bacteria Rhodococcus wratislaviensis  for the degradation 
and detoxification of 4-nitrophenol, nitrite was released during the degradation (Gemini et al, 
2005).  Likewise, nitrite may also be releas ed during the degradation of 4-nitrophenol by 
Pleurotus ostreatus .  The nitrite can possibly be the s ource of the nitro group added onto the 
benzene ring.  The 2,4-dinitroanisole was considered to be transformed from 2,4-dinitrophenol by a methylation step similar to that of 4-nitrophenol to 4-nitr oanisole. This hypothesis was later 
tested in a separate experiment.

The gas chromatograms of the 7 day culture, both TIC and SIC displays (Figure 4.36 and 
4.37), along with the HPLC results  (Figure 4.38) of 7 day culture, confirmed that 4-nitroanisole, 
2,4-dinitrophenol and 2,4-dinitroa nisole were produced from 4-nitrophenol.  Another compound, 
1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene (18.280min), was detected.  This compound was previous 
detected in cultures containing only dyes, including Disperse Re d 1, Disperse Red 19, Disperse 
Orange 25 and Disperse Red 13.  It is suggested that the transformation of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-
nitrobenzene from 4-nitrophe nol was responsible for the detection of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-
nitrobenzene in dye degradation cultures.  Howe ver, although the degradation of Disperse Red 
13, does not produce 4-nitrophenol, 1,2-dimethoxy-4- nitrobenzene was nevertheless detected in 
the 7 day sample.  This suggests that 1,2-dime thoxy-4-nitrobenzene may be produced  by another 
pathway not involving 4-nitrophneol.

It has been shown that the initial dye concen tration can affect the degradation results.  
This brought up the question as to  the initial concentr ation of 4-nitrophenol, when taken as 
starting compound, may also affect the degradation results.  To test this, pure 4-nitrophenol 
powder was added to the cultur es to give initial concentrations at 25ppm, 50ppm and 100ppm.  
The amount of 4-nitrophenol a nd its degradation pr oducts were monitored by HPLC every day 
for 7 days.

The results show that degradation did not occur at 100 ppm 4-nitrophenol.  The amount 
of 4-nitrophenol did not change after 7 days exposure (Figure 4.39).  Cultures initially having 50 
ppm 4-nitrophenol removed about  10 percent of the total 4- nitrophenol and gave fewer 
degradation products than 25 ppm ones.  Culture s having 25 ppm initial 4-nitrophenol illustrated 
very effective reduction of 4-nitrophenol.  Afte r 5 days degradation, almost 90 percent of the 4-
nitrophenol was degraded.  Less than one percen t still remained in the culture after 7 days 
degradation.  These results show  that an initial 4-nitrophenol concentration as high as 100 ppm 
may be too toxic for the fungus to undergo any degradation.  The white rot fungus Pleurotus 
ostreatus  may be a potential degrader for the envir onmental 4-nitrophenol, but only if a low 
concentration exists.   In addition, more resear ch is needed to study the products from the 4-
nitrophenol degradation by Pleurotus ostreatus,  and their toxicities.  
 79 
Figure 4.40 shows the transformation of 4-nitrop henol to 4-nitroanisole after introduction 
of the former to fungal culture.  Only the cult ures having starting concen tration of 25 ppm and 50 
ppm were able to produce 4-nitr oanisole.  When the initial 4-nitrophenol was raised to 100ppm, 
no 4-nitroanisole was detected.  In the cultu res initially having 25 pp m of 4-nitrophenol, the 
amount of 4-nitroanisole constantly increased until 6 days, when 4-nitrophenol  was almost totally 
removed.  The 50 ppm samples also exhibited a consta nt increase of 4-nitroanisole in the culture, 
but with much variation.

Given the results discussed, it was conclu ded that the initial concentration of 4-
nitrophenol played a very important role in the degradation.  A relatively  high concentration may 
lead to lower fungal growth, lower level of en zyme production and therefore less degradation 
effectiveness.  In cultures ha ving an initial concentration of 50 ppm 4-nitrophenol, another 
compound 4-nitroguaiacol (2-met hoxy-4-nitrophenol) was detected (Figure 4.44), but was not 
detected in either the 25 ppm or 100 ppm sa mples. The reaction that was responsible for 
production of 4-nitroguaiacol apparently was a r eaction competitive with the production of 2,4-
dinitrophenol since they were at tacking the same position on th e benzene ring in  4-nitrophenol. 
Nevertheless, the production of  4-nitroguaiacol and 2,4-nitrophenol  suggested that the meta-
position to the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring in 4- nitrophenol is a very active site that can 
accept some small functional groups  and form new compounds.

4.3.3 Secondary degradation of the primary product 4-nitroaniline and the influence of 
initial concentration 
During the fungal degradation of Disperse Red 1, 4-nitroaniline was found to decrease 
after several days.  It was believed that further degradation had occurred to the 4-nitroaniline in 
the fungal culture.  Thus pure 4-nitroaniline was added to a Pleurotus ostreatus  culture as the 
starting compound at 25 ppm initial concentration.  The possible degradation compounds were identified by GC/MS and HPLC. 
The gas chromatogram of 1 day culture gave  only two peaks that were assigned to 
veratryl alcohol and the startin g compound 4-nitroaniline (Figure 4.45).  However, after 4 days 
degradation, 3 products were identified.  They  were nitrobenzene, 4-nitroanisole and 4-
nitrophenol (Figure 4.46). An unknown metabolit e at about 21.162 min was also detected, but 
the structure was not clarified.

The gas chromatogram of the 7 day culture confirmed the production of nitrobenzene and 
4-nitroanisole with several more unknown peaks (Figure 4.47).  The HPLC chromatogram was 
in accordance with the results given by GC/MS a nd confirmed that 4-nitrophenol was in the 7 
day degradation culture (Figure 4.48).  A compound that was detected earlier during 4-
nitrophenol degradation, 1,2-dime thoxy-4-nitrobenzene,  was again detected in 4-nitroaniline 
degradation cultures.  It is still not clear whether the produc tion of 4-nitroanisole and 1,2-
dimethoxy-4-nitrobenze were due to the 4-n itrophenol, which was also produced in 4-
nitroaniline culture, or if there is another mechanism responsible for their formation. However, the formation of nitrobenzene and 4-nitrophenol indicated that 4-nitroaniline might lose an ammonia molecule to form a fr ee radical that later accepted a hydrogen or hydroxyl radical to

Figure 4.49 A schematic pathway for degradation of 4-nitroaniline by Pleurotus ostreatus 
 
As the initial concentration of 4-nitroph enol was found to greatly influence the 
degradation, it was reas onable to examine whether the initial  concentration of 4-nitroaniline 
affect the degradation as well.  Pure 4-nitroanili ne was added to culture aliquots to give three 
different initial concentrations  at 25 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm.  The amount of 4-nitroaniline 
and its degradation products was monitored by HPLC for 7 days.  The cultures having 25 ppm 4-nitroaniline showed the most degr adation efficiency with more than 40 percent of 4-nitroaniline 
degraded after 7 days.  About 40 percent of the to tal 4-nitroaniline was de graded in the culture 
 87 
with initial concentration of 50 ppm, while only 20 percent of 4-nitroaniline was degraded in the 
100ppm sample.  Unlike the case of 4-nitrophenol, for which 100 ppm starting concentration 
completely depressed the degradation, a starting c oncentration at 100 ppm of  4-nitroaniline still 
showed some degradation despite being a relatively low percent.

of nitrobenzene in the cultures in dicated that nitrobenzene is not further degraded by the fungus.

Figure 4.51 Production of 4-nitrobenzen e from 4-nitroaniline with diffe rent initial concentrations 
 
 
As was mentioned, the producti on of 4-nitroanisole in cu ltures initially only having 4-
nitroaniline is quite complex, since 4-nitroanisole can be produced from 4-nitrophenol, which 
itself was also produced from 4-nitroaniline.  In  addition, 4-nitroaniline may transform into 4-
nitroanisole without going through the form ation of 4-nitrophenol.  A higher starting 
concentration of 4-nitroaniline did produce a higher level of 4-nitrophenol, but the amount of 4-
nitrophenol in all cultures  reached a maximum level after four or five days , and then decreased to 
certain levels.  Such a trend can easily be explai ned by the fact that 4-nitrophenol can be readily 
further degraded by Pleurotus ostreatus , especially at a low con centration (Figure 4.52).

Surprisingly, neither 25 ppm or 100 ppm starting 4-nitroaniline concentrations showed 
the highest level for production of 4-nitroanisole  (Figure 4.53).  However, when the complexity 
of production of 4-nitroanisole is taken into consideration, such resu lts may be understood. A 
higher starting concentration can produce more 4-nitrophenol in the culture, which provides 
more 4-nitrophenol available to transform into 4-nitroanisole.  Meanwhile, a higher starting 
concentration of 4-nitroaniline would reach a lower level of degradation.  Therefore, the way to 
produce 4-nitroanisole directly from 4-nitroaniline was depre ssed.  Thus a middle ground could 
be reached with a middle level of starting concentration of 4-nitroaniline.

Figure 4.54 Production of 1,2-dimethxoy- 4-nitrobenzene from 4-nitroaniline with different initial 
concentrations 
 
The mechanism of the production of 1,2-di methoxy-4-nitrobenzene is not yet clearly 
understood.  In this study, it was detected in different degradation cultures, including the ones 
with dyes and ones with 4-nitroani line and 4-nitroanisole. In the case of 4-nitroa niline (Figure 
 91 
4.54), only in 25 ppm starting concentration cultures was 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene 
detected.  Other research has shown 1,2-di methoxy-4-nitrobenzene can be completely 
mineralized by another type of white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium , into nitrite, water 
and CO 2 (Valli, K et al., 1992) .
Since several secondary products  have been discovered from degradations of two of the 
three primary products, the question may be asked as to whether further products will be formed 
from the degradation of the sec ondary products. In order to an swer this question, experiments 
were carried out to find any po ssible products from the degradations of the secondary products. 
The fungal cultures were prepared with 10 mM buffer concentration and incubated for 3 days 
before the addition of individual secondary products to give an initial concentration of 25ppm.  
After 4 days degradation, the cultures were sa mpled and analyzed by GC/MS and HPLC.  Four 
days after the addition of 4-nitroa nisole, veratryl alcohol and 4-ni trophenol were detected.  In the 
gas chromatogram, the peak at 17.481 min was assigned to 4-nitrophenol (Figure 4.55).  The 
peak at 25.376 min in HPLC chromatogram al so confirmed that 4-nitrophenol was produced 
(Figure 4.56). The unknown peak at 29.555 min wa s not 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene, even 
though the retention time was very close to that of  1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene.  However, the UV spectrum of that peak was totally different from that of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene. The 
production of 4-nitrophenol suggested that the re verse reaction of methyl ation, demethylation of 
4-nitroanisole into 4-nitrophenol did exist.  Such demethylation has also been reported by  Valli 
et al, (1992) in research of using Phanerochaete chysosporium  to degrade 2,4-dinitrotoluene.

Four days after 4-nitroguai acol was added into culture,  1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene 
was detected (Figure 4.57).  Gas chromatogram  clearly showed the peak of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-
nitrobenzene at 18.369 min, and the peak at 29.609 min in HPLC chromatogram was also 
assigned to 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitroben zene (Figure 4.58).  This result has already been  reported in 
earlier (Lu, 2004). Therefore, to this point, 1,2- dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene has been detected in 
various degradation cultures, which apparently i ndicates that there are more than one mechanism 
involved in the production of 1,2-dimethoxy- 4-nitrobenzene.  Nevertheless, when 1,2-
dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene was added to cultures as the initial compound, no further degradation 
products were found (Figure 4.59).  Gas chro matogram showed only two more compounds, 
veratryl alcohol and veratryl alde hyde.  But this result did not eliminate the likelihood that 1,2-
dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene was further degraded by Pleurotus ostreatus .  GC/MS is only able to 
identify volatile or semi-volatile compounds. In this case, if 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene was 
degraded into compounds that are not volatile, then these compounds would not be seen in the 
 93 
gas chromatogram.  HPLC analysis was not conducted for the degradation of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-
nitrobenzene due to its lack of capability of identifying unknow n compounds.  A HPLC system 
coupled with mass spectrometry will be very useful for future study.

It was discussed that the 2,4-dinitrophenol may be under going a methylation step and 
transform into 2,4-dinitroanisole.  However, th e gas chromatograms of 4 day cultures of 2,4-
dinitrophenol and 2,4-dinitroaniso le did not support such a s uggestion (Figure 4.60).  No 2,4-
dinitroanisole was detected in the culture initially having 2,4-dini trophenol.  One and two 
unknown compounds were detected for 2,4-dinitrophe nol and 2,4-dinitroani sole (Figure 4.61), 
respectively, and the structures of these new compounds were not clear.  As was previously 
shown, the concentration of the initial compounds added to culture can play a critical role in 
degradation.  In this case, a 25 ppm starting concentration of 2,4-dinitr ophenol may or may not 
be too high for the methylation to happen.  Furthe r research needs to be done to study that.

Given the degradation results of 4-nitrophenol and its des cendants, a scheme of the 
degradation pathway of 4-nitrophe nol was proposed (Figure 4.62).  The 4-nitroanisole appeared 
to be one of the major products from 4-nitrophe nol, and it was also able to revert back to 4-
nitrophenol through a demethylation step. The products 2,4-dinitrophenol  and 4-nitroguaiacol 
seemed to be produced by two competing mech anisms With a low starting 4-nitrophenol 
concentration,  the production of  2,4-dinitrophenol was favored.  A starting concentration of 4-
nitrophenol as high as 50ppm was more likely to produce 4-nitroguaiacol.

The 4-nitroguaiacol was f ound to transform in to 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene, but 
whether a similar methylation step is responsible  for the production of 2,4- dinitroanisole is still 
not clear.  The 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene has been found to be produced  by cultures initially 
having different compounds, including dyes, 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroaniline a nd 4-nitroguaiacol. It 
was suggested that more than one mechanism was responsible for the production of 1,2-
dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene.  The mechanisms involved in the production of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-
nitrobenzene need to be st udied in the future.

CHAPTER 5 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DISCUSSION 
 
This study investigated the degradation of  five nitrophenylazophenylamine dye by white 
rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus.  The effects of buffer concentration, pH, agitation and 
temperature on decolorization of three water solu ble dyes, Orange II, Acid Red 29 and Remazol 
Brilliant Blue R were studied to establish the optimal conditi ons for decolorization.  Such 
conditions were then applied in  the degradation of Disperse Red 1, Disperse Red 19, Disperse 
Orange 1, Disperse Orange 25 a nd Disperse Red 13.  The primary products from these five azo 
dyes were identified by GC/MS and HPLC.  Furt her degradation of the primary products was 
also investigated. The degradation pathways of  these dyes were proposed, and the degradation 
pathways of the primary products were also di scussed.  The major findings of this study are 
summarized as follows. 
1. Using the water soluble dyes, the buffe r concentration of the fungal culture 
was found to play a significant role  in fungal growth and subsequent 
decolorization.  Without buffer, the cu ltures were not able to decolorize 
anyone of the three water soluble dyes.   However, a buffer concentration of 30 
mM was also not satisfactory for decolorization.  The optimal buffer 
concentration was found at 10 mM or 20 mM.  
2. The initial pH value of the fungal cultu re also was found to be critical for 
decolorization.  An initial pH at 3 or 4 did not give significant decolorization, 
 99 
while pH at 5 or 7 seemed to be the mo st suitable for decolorization of all three 
water soluble dyes.  
3. Agitation was essential for the decolorization of the three water soluble dyes.  
Without agitation, no decolorization was obs erved.  However, with agitation at 
150 rpm, substantial decolorization was seen. 
4. The effect of culture temperature on d ecolorization was examined.  Both 30 ºC 
and 35 ºC gave high efficiency of deco lorization of Orange II.   The 25 ºC 
condition though lagging behind 30 ºC a nd 35 ºC, achieved a high degree of 
decolorization after 3 days.  
5. All three water soluble dyes showed some extent of bio-adsorption, 20 percent at most, on dead fungal mass.  Howe ver, this amount of bio-adsorption 
contributes only a small portion of th e decolorization observed in the live 
fungal cultures.  
6. Ten mM buffer, pH of 5 and 30 ºC se emed to be the optimal condition for 
decolorization of the water. 
7. Nitrobenzene, 4-nitrophenol and 4-nitroa niline were identif ied as the three 
primary products from Disperse Red 1, Disperse Red 19, Disperse Orange 1, 
Disperse Orange 25.  A degradation path way of these four structurally-similar 
dyes was discussed.  Disperse Red 13  was found to produce 1-chloro-3-
nitrobenzene, 2-chloro-4-nitroanisol e and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline as its 
degradation products.  
8. No further degradation products of  nitrobenzene were identified.  
 100 
9. Five compounds, 4-nitroanisole, 1,2- dinitrophenol, 1,2-dintroanisole, 4-
nitroguaiacol and 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitroben zene were detected in the culture 
initial containing 4-nitrophenol.  A degr adation pathway of 4-nitrophenol was 
proposed.   The initial concentration of the 4-nitrophenol added to fungal 
cultures was found to be crucial for degradation.   A concentration of 100 ppm 
was apparently too toxic a nd inhibited degradations.  Given a concentration of 
25 ppm, the fungal culture was able to degrade more than 90 percent of  4-
nitrophenol  within 7 days.  
10. Four compounds, nitrobenzene, 4-ni trophenol, 4-nitroanisole and 1,2-
dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene, were detected in the culture initially containing 4-
nitroaniline after 7 days.  A degradation pathway of 4-nitroaniline was proposed.   The initial concentration of the 4-nitroaniline added to the fungal 
cultures was found to affect degradation, however, not as much as in the case 
of 4-nitrophenol.    
11. The product 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene has been found to be produced by 
cultures initially having various com pounds, including dyes, 4-nitrophenol, 4-
nitroaniline and 4-nitroguaiacol. It  was suggested that more than one 
mechanism was responsible for the production of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-
nitrobenzene.   
The optimum culture parameters, including buffer concentration, pH, agitation and 
temperature were established from decolorization of three water soluble dyes, which were then 
used for the degradation of five azo dyes.  However, enzyme productions and their possible 
correlations with decolorization efficiency were still not successfully determined.  In future 
 101 
work, more study has to be done on the enzyme production and other factors involved in the 
decolorization and degradation.  
Primary degradation products from the five nitrophenylazophenylamine dyes were 
identified.  The proposed pathway of such degrad ations may be applied to structurally similar 
dyes in other studies.  Several secondary products were discovered from the primary products.  
However, our current analytical techniques may not  be able to identify all possible degradation 
products.  GC/MS is only able to detect volatile or semi-volatile compounds, while HPLC is not 
quite powerful in identifying unknown compounds w ithout Mass spectrometry.  Techniques like 
LC/MS may be needed in future study.  Other t echniques may also be applied to answer whether 
complete mineralization happens to dye in the degradation.
