a-Oximinonitriles can be prepared conveniently b\- dehydrogenation of a-hydroxylaminonitriles which are accessible from 
aldoximes. The nitration of a-oximinonitriles with 100% nitric acid and ammonium nitrate leads to a,a-dinitronitriles. 
These in turn can be cleaved to 1,1-dinitroparaffins by action of ammonia.
Aldoximes react with hydrocyanic acid at room  
temperature to give a-hydroxylaminonitriles (I).2  
On reaction with nitrogen dioxide in chloroform  
or methylene chloride or with 100% nitric acid and  
ammonium nitrate these compounds are dehydro­
genated and nitrated to a,a-dinitronitriles (II).  
It is established that the a-oximinonitriles (III)

are intermediates in the reaction with nitrogen  
dioxide and that impurities with carbonyl absorp­
tion are introduced in this step. a-Hydroxylamino-  
nitriles (I) can be dehydrogenated to III without  
undesirable by-products by heating with one molar  
equivalent of p-benzoquinone in benzene. This  
dehydrogenation of I is a general method of prepa­
ration for the previously difficultly accessible ni­
triles III.
The nitration of a-oximinonitriles (III) with  
nitrogen dioxide or with 100% nitric acid and am­
monium nitrate yields the pure a,a-dinitronitriles

from a-hydroxylaminonitriles (I) and the failure to obtain 
them from a-oximinonitriles (III) under the same condi­
tions is tentatively ascribed to the formation of intermediate 
nitrite esters, the elimination of nitrous acid, and hydroly­
sis of the resultant ¡mines, as follows:

acid to aldoximes was carried out according to procedures A 
and C of Neelakantan and Hartung.2  It was advantageous 
in the latter to reverse the order of addition— i.e., adding a

ture of aldoxime and bisulfite solution. Procedure A gave 
better yields in all cases and the product was isolated in

T h e  Beckm ann Rearrangem ent o f Fenchone Oxim e
R. IV. COTTIXGHAM
Received January 7, 1060
The Beckmann rearrangement of fenchone oxime has been carried out under a variety of conditions to give apparently 
exclusive formation of products arising from scission of the bridgehead bond. It would appear that both the normal and 
anomalous products are derived from the concerted anil-migration process generally accepted as the initial step in the 
Beckmann rearrangement, and that the stability of the incipient carbonium ion adjacent to the oximino function is of 
importance only in determining the relative amounts of the two products.
The literature of the Beckmann rearrangement  
contains numerous examples of a competitive re­
action in which an unsaturated nitrile rather than  
the usual amide is produced by treatment of a  
ketoxime with a strong acid.1  2 “3  Notable among  
compounds undergoing this anomalous reaction  
are the oximes of bicyclic ketones having bridge­
heads adjacent to the oximino functions. The  
oximes of camphor,4  5  verbanone,6  and various nor-  
camphane derivatives6 - 7  8  give, under conditions com­
monly employed for the Beckmann rearrangement,  
mixed products to which the competitive reaction  
contributed appreciably. The rearrangement of  
fenchone oxime (I) is of particular interest in this  
connection, for despite the ditertiary structure of  
the oxime, both the normal and anomalous rear­
rangements proceeded exclusively via scission of  
the bridgehead bond.
Treatment of the sharp melting oxime with p- 
toluenesulfonyl chloride and pyridine, phosphorus  
pentachloride, or sulfuric acid lead in all cases to  
the formation of a single lactam which was isomeric  
with the oxime and a liquid which from its in­
frared spectrum was obviously an unsaturated  
nitrile (—C = N  stretching 4.50 p, C =C  stretching  
6.03 p, vinyl C—H stretching 3.32 p).s The in­

structure V or Va rather than the possible, albeit  
less likely, isomeric structures VII or Vila, as the  
major peak attributed to the gem methyls was  
extremely sharp and devoid of any indication of the  
splitting expected of the isopropyl group common  
to the latter pair. Moreover, the band at 183 cps.  
appears to require the presence of the allylic  
methyl group of the structures V and Va.
Asa mixture of a- and /3-fencholenonitriles (V and
VI) has been reported to arise from the treatment of  
fenchone oxime with boiling 5% sulfuric acid,1 0  rep­
etition of the work was undertaken for the purpose  
of comparing the mixed product with that obtained  
under dehydrating conditions. The nitrile obtained  
from the dilute acid treatment of the oxime was in­
distinguishable in infrared and proton resonance  
spectra from a sample of the product of the reaction  
with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine. Vapor  
phase chromatography1 1  showed no separation of the  
product isomers despite the fact that they are re­
ported to differ in boiling point by 7°. Moreover,  
alkaline hydrolysis under conditions reported by  
Cockburn to give good conversion of V to a- 
fencholenamide of VI to /3-fencholedc acid yielded  
largely amide and recovered nitrile with a total  
crude acidic product which accounted for only  
10% of the theoretical amount. That this product  
was largely a-fencholenie acid was shown by a strong  
proton resonance band for vinyl hydrogen, vapor  
phase chromatography which gave one peak ac­
counting for at least 80% of the crude mixture, and  
conversion of the crude acid to an amide identical  
with that obtained in the hydrolysis step by treat­
ment with oxallyl chloride and ammonia.
The disparity between the results of the present  
and earlier studies may be attributable to a dif­
ference in isomeric purity of the starting materials.  
The assumption that the oxime employed in the  
earlier work contained an appreciable amount of the  
low melting isomer described by Delepine1 2  would  
account for the formation of mixed rearrangement  
products. As the low melting oxime is unstable  
with respect to the high melting isomer in alcohol  
solution, it would appear that the alcohol-recrystal-  
lized starting material employed in the present work  
contained little if any of the unstable isomer. From  
the present data it may be concluded that the nitrile  
produced from the high melting isomer of fenchone  
oxime arises preponderantly if not exclusively from  
cleavage of the bridgehead bond even in dilute  
aqueous acid.

the same conditions as were employed in the Beck­
mann rearrangement produced an unsaturated  
nitrile identical in infrared spectrum with that ob­
tained from the rearrangement; moreover, a mix­
ture of the two nitriles was inseparable by vapor  
phase chromatography.1 1  Conversion of the original  
nitrile to the lactam was effected by the Ritter  
reaction1 3  with sulfuric acid, and the lactam formed  
in this manner was shown to be identical with that  
produced directly from the oxime in melting point,  
mixed melting point, and infrared spectrum.  
While the yield of lactam derived from the Ritter  
reaction was poor, these interconversions determine  
unequivocally that both of the isolated products  
(accounting in one case for 96% of the theoretical  
total) arise from cleavage of the bridgehead bond.
This unidirectional rearrangement would appear  
to imply that the initial step in both the normal  
and anomalous reactions involves a concerted  
cleavage of the N—O bond and migration of either  
the bridgehead atom or the electrons involved in  
the bridgehead bond to form the intermediate  
ions II or IV respectively. That either of these
H
IV V Va
processes is compatible with the generally accepted  
¿rans-migration mechanism of the Beckmann re­
arrangement is apparent from a consideration of  
the steric relationships in the oxime. The co­
planarity of the bridgehead methyl group with the  
oximino function should sterically favor the oxime  
isomer having the hydroxyl group syn to the gem 
methjds which are located symmetrically on op­
posite sides of the oximino plane; hence the high  
melting compound which was obtained should have  
the configuration depicted in I with the bridgehead  
bond trans  to the hydroxyl function.
That the ion II rather than IV is the initial inter­
mediate in the formation of the lactam may be  
inferred from the relative amounts of lactam ob­
tained from the rearrangement and the Ritter  
reaction. As the ion IV must be the precursor of  
II in the latter reaction, which produces much less  
lactam than is derived directly from the oxime  
under the same conditions, IV must not be in­
volved in the major reaction path leading to the  
lactam. The assumption that both of the rear­
rangement products arise via the initial formation of

the bicyclic ion II followed by the product-forming  
steps which have been shown to be reversible is  
compatible with the generally accepted mechanism  
of the Beckmann rearrangement and is attractive  
but for the fact that a competitive path leading to  
the unsaturated nitrile through the direct forma­
tion of IV may exist.
Irrespective of which of these species is the initial  
intermediate in the formation of the nitrile, it may  
be concluded that the direction of the anomalous  
reaction like that of the normal process is de­
termined by the configuration of the oxime and that  
the stability of the incipient carbonium ion trans  
to the hydroxyl group is of importance only in  
determining the relative amounts of nitrile and  
lactam in the products. This latter conclusion is in  
at least qualitative agreement with the results of  
the rearrangements of a number of closely related  
oximes. Camphor4  and fenchone oximes yielded  
unsaturated nitriles as the major products of this  
reaction; verbanone oxime6  (VIII) gave only a  
small amount of the corresponding product;  
and d-dihydroumbellulone oxime1 4  (IX) produced  
only lactam in excellent yield in keeping with the  
diminishing stability of the substituted cyclopentyl,

tion subsided, the bright yellow solution was allowed to 
stand overnight. It was then warmed on the steam bath 
for 30 min. and poured into a mixture of 30 ml. of 36 N 
sulfuric acid and 125 g. of ice.
The acidic suspension was extracted with three 100-ml. 
portions of ether; the ethereal solution was washed with 5% 
aqueous sodium bicarbonate and dried over anhydrous 
magnesium sulfate. Removal of the solvent from the dried 
ether solution left a two-phase residue which was shown to 
contain three volatile components separable by vapor phase 
chromatography. Two of these were later identified as water 
and the unsaturated nitrile described below. The third 
component was not found in the crude product when phos­
phorus pentachloride rvas used to effect the rearrangement, 
and no attempt at its identification was made.
The crude product was triturated with 50 ml. of petroleum 
ether (b.p. 30-60°) and the hydrocarbon solution was dis­
tilled through a 45-cm. spinning band column to give, after 
removal of the solvent, 10.1 g. of a colorless liquid, b.p. 
100-102°/19.5 mm. which was shown by infrared analysis 
to be an unsaturated nitrile. Elemental analysis and proton 
magnetic resonance data (Table I) indicated that this prod­
uct was one of the cyclopentenylisobutyronitriles V or Va, 
or a mixture of the two.

The petroleum ether insoluble material from the above 
step was combined with the residue in the still pot, and this 
mixture was recrystallized from the minimal amount of 95% 
alcohol which -would dissolve it at the boil ( ca. 20 ml.) to 
give 4.7 g. of fine needles, m.p. 163-164°. An analytical 
specimen of this product was sublimed at reduced pressure 
(130°/10 mm.), and the product so obtained was shown by 
elemental analysis, infrared spectrum, and interconversion 
with the nitrile described above to be l,4,4-trimethyl-2-

The total isolated products of this reaction accounted for 
96% conversion of the oxime to what appeared to be a single 
nitrile and a single lactam.
(b) With phosphorus pentachloride .1 8  Fenchone oxime 
(16.7 g., 0.1 mole) was added slowly with stirring to a sus­
pension of 17 g. of phosphorus pentachloride in 175 ml. of 
petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) at a rate which maintained 
vigorous boiling of the solvent. When the reaction had sub­
sided, the mixture was allowed to stand overnight and the 
solvent was removed by evaporation on the steam bath. 
Ice (200 g.) was added to the residue, the aqueous sus­
pension was extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether, 
and the products were isolated in the manner described 
above to give 10.5 g. of the unsaturated nitrile and 1.3 g. 
of the lactam (total yield 78%).
(c) With concentrated sulfuric acidA  Fenchone oxime 
(16.7 g., 0.1 mole) was added portionwise to 20 ml. of cold 
36Ar sulfuric acid with stirring and ice cooling to maintain 
the reaction temperature below 25°. When the addition was 
completed, the mixture was allowed to stand in a water bath 
at 25° for ca. 5 min., whereupon the temperature rose 
spontaneously to 55° and the solution became dark red and 
then brown.
After neutralization with ice cold aqueous sodium hy­
droxide, the mixture was ether extracted and the products 
were isolated in the manner described above to give 5.6 g. 
of the nitrile and 1.2 g. of the lactam. The considerable 
amount of resinous material which remained after the 
isolation of these products was assumed to be a mixture 
of a low molecular weight polyamide1 9  and hydrolysis prod­
ucts derived from the nitrile and lactam.

(d) With dilute sulfuric acid.1 0  The oxime (25 g.) was 
boiled for 1  hr. with a solution of 5 ml. of 36V sulfuric acid 
in 125 ml. of water and worked up in the manner of the 
reference cited to give a nitrile indistinguishable in its 
infrared and preton resonance spectra from that described 
above. No attempt at isolation of the lactam was made.
Hydrolysis of the nitrile.  A mixture of 10 g. of the nitrile 
derived from the reaction of fenchone oxime with dilute 
sulfuric acid, 10 g. of potassium hj'droxide, 25 ml. of meth­
anol, and 10 ml. of water was heated under reflux for 60 hr. 
The methanol was removed by distillation at reduced pres­
sure, water (50 ml.) was added, the mixture was cooled 
to 0°, and the oily solid which precipitated was filtered 
and recrystallized from benzene-petroleum ether (b.p. 30- 
60°) to give 4.S g. (43%) of di-a-fencholenamide as white 
platelets, m.p. 85-86.5°. An analytical specimen was pre­
pared by sublimation at 100°/1 mm.

Evaporation of the mother liquor from the recrystalliza­
tion of the amide produced a liquid residue (3.2 g.) which 
was shown by its infrared spectrum to be largely unchanged 
starting material containing a small amount of the amide 
as evidenced by the amide carbonyl band.
The alkaline solution from the hydrolysis was cooled in 
ice and acidified with lrydrochloric acid. The amber liquid 
which separated was removed and the aqueous phase 
was extracted with ether. The organic solutions were com­
bined, dried with anlrydrous magnesium sulfate, and the 
solvent was removed by distillation from a steam bath at 
10 mm. The crude acidic product obtained in this manner 
was a viscous yellow-brown oil which was identified as con­
taining largely a-fencholenic acid by the presence of a band 
for vinyl hydrogen in its proton resonance spectrum and 
vapor phase chromatography which indicated the crude acid 
was at least 80% one component.
The crude acid (0.8 g.) was heated under reflux for 2 hr. 
with 15 ml. of oxallyl chloride. The mixture was concen­
trated by distillation from the steam bath, and the brown 
oily residue was treated with 30 ml. of 30% aqueous am­
monia to produce a brown solid. This product was twice 
recrystallized from benzene-petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) 
to give 0.3 g. of slightly yellow' platelets identical in infrared 
spectrum, melting point and mixed melting point with the 
amide obtained directly from hydrolysis of the nitrile.
The Ritter reaction of the unsaturated nitrile.1 3  The nitrile 
obtained from the above reactions (50 g., 0.33 mole) wasadded cautiously, with stirring, to 50 ml. of 36.V sulfuric 
acid. The mixture was cooled in an ice bath throughout the 
addition to maintain the reaction temperature below 25°. 
When the addition of the nitrile was completed, the reaction 
mixture was allowed to stand in the ice bath for an addi­
tional 0.5 hr. and then warmed to room temperature, where­
upon the temperature rose spontaneously to 60° and the mix­
ture turned red and foamed slightly. The flask was then 
stoppered loosely and allowed to stand overnight.
The dark brown resinous mixture w'as poured into an ice 
cold solution of 80 g. of sodium hydroxide in 500 ml. of water 
and the aqueous suspension was extracted four times w'ith 
a total of 1  1 . of ether. The ethereal extract was dried over 
anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to dryness 
to give an oily browm residue which was triturated with 
petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) to remove the unsaturated 
nitrile.
The crude product was worked up in the usual manner to 
give 10 g. of unchanged nitrile and ca. 0.5 g. of lactam which 
was shown to be identical with the product obtained 
directly from the oxime in melting point, mixed melting 
point, and infrared spectrum. (As in the sulfuric acid cata­
lyzed rearrangement, a large amount of resinous material 
w'as formed.)
Dehydration of the lactam.3 0  A mixture of 3.24 g. of the 
lactam, 3.4 g. of phosphorus pentachloride and 35 ml. of 
petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) w'as allowed to stand for 48 
hr. with periodic shaking and then heated for 1  hr. on a 
steam bath. The mixture was worked up in the manner de­
scribed for the Beckman rearrangement with phosphorus 
pentachloride to give 1.9 g. of nitrile which was identical 
with that derived directly from the oxime in infrared spec­
trum and inseparable from the latter in vapor phase chro­
matography.

Two isomeric p-menthane-3,4-diols, (+  )-cfs-4-hydroxymenthol (Via) and ( —  )-irans-4-hydroxyneoisomenthol (VIb), were 
prepared by lithium aluminum hydride reduction of two isomeric p-menthane-4,8-epoxy-3-ols (Va) and (Vb) which were 
derived from (+  )-pulegone. With 10% sulfuric acid, Via and VIb were dehydrated to a menthone mixture (VII) which was 
composed of 65% ( —  )-menthone and 35% (+  )-isomenthone.

terpinene-l-ol-4,a-terpineol, limonene, or a-pinene  
via 3-p-menthene. According to Klyne,5  6  7  the course  
of a pinacolic rearrangement depends on whether  
an axial or an equatorial hydroxyl group is elimi­
nated. Therefore, the information regarding the  
predominant conformation of isomeric VI may con­
tribute to the understanding of the stereochemistry  
of the above reaction. From this viewpoint the  
results hitherto obtained2-4 are not considered to  
be satisfactory because of the uncertainty about  
the relationship between the Ci-methyl group and  
other substituents in VI.
(-\-)-cisA-Hydroxymenthol  (Via) and (-)-trans-  
+ hydroxyneoisomenthol  (VIb). Usually VI is pre­
pared by the oxidation of 3-p-menthene2-4- 6-8  
but this oxidation yields theoretically four geo­
metrical isomers. Consequently the assignment of  
configuration may be difficult. Another possible  
route starting from 4-bromomenthone was ex­
amined by Jefferies and Milligan8  but the product  
was p-menthane-2,3-diol.
For the starting compound, we prepared pure  
( —)-cfs-pulegol (I), which has a higher melting  
point and higher optical rotation than reported by  
Macbeth and Shannon9  for an impure specimen.  
Because hydrogenation of I over palladium-  
charcoal yields quantitatively ( — )-menthol (III),  
the cis relationship between the Ci-methyl and  
C3 -hydroxyl group in I is established. The infrared  
spectrum indicates that the double bond in I isof the isopropylidene type.9  Epoxidation of (— )-  
cfs-pulegyl-p-nitrobenzoate (II) with per benzol—  
acid yields two isomeric epoxides (IVa) and (IVb)  
in the ratio 1:1.3 with traces of triol mono-p-  
nitrobenzoate. The epoxides (IVa)(m.p. 134-135°)  
and (IVb) (m.p. 128-129°) are hydrolyzed to the  
corresponding p-menthane - 4,8 - epoxy - 3 - ols  
(Va) (m.p. 73-75°) and (Vb) (an oil) without open­
ing the oxide ring. In ether, IVa is reduced with  
lithium aluminum hydride to (+)-cts-4-hydroxy-  
menthol (VIa)(m.p. 80-81°), whereas IVb resists  
the reduction giving only Vb. In tetrahydrofuran,  
however, all of the isomers of IV and V are reduced  
with lithium aluminum hydride to the correspond­
ing diols, Via and ( —  )-(rans-4-hydroxyneoiso-  
menthol (VIb) (m.p. 75-76°).
The cis and trans  relationships between the two  
hydroxyl groups in Via and VIb are determined  
by the fact that Via is cleaved faster than VIb with  
lead tetraacetate. Such relationships are also de­
duced from the infrared spectra of Via and VIb  
in dilute solution (carbon tetrachloride). In Via  
an intramolecular hydrogen bonded 0 —H stretch­
ing absorption1 0 -1 1  is observed at 3584 cm.-1 be­
sides a free 0 —H stretching absorption at 3636  
cm.-1, whereas in VIb only the latter absorption  
is observed at 3623 cm-1. From the absence of hy­
drogen bonding in VIb, the predominant conforma­
tion of VIb is considered as such that the compara­
tively large isopropyl group takes an equatorial  
position and this forces the hydroxyl groups to  
take a diaxial conformation. The isopropyl group  
in Via may also take an equatorial conformation,  
because such conformation seems to be more ener­
getically favored than an axial conformation.
Pinacolic dehydration of Via and VIb.  With  
10% sulfuric acid, Via and VIb are dehydrated to  
a menthone mixture (VII). The infrared spectrum  
of VII corresponds to that of a mixture of ( —)-  
menthone and (+)-isomenthone. The composition  
of VII can be calculated1 2 -1 3  from the optical ro­
tation of VII ([a]n +15°) as composed of 65%

VII, the semicarbazone and 2,4-dinitrophenyl-  
hydrazone of ( — )-menthone are isolated. The cor­
responding derivatives of (+ )-isomen thone are not  
obtained.
According to Klyne,5  trans  geometry between a  
departing and a migrating group determines the  
reaction course of the pinacolic dehydration of  
cyclohexane diols. But such trans  geometry is not  
possible in the dehydration of VIb to VII. The pres­
ent result can be explained well by assuming an  
intermediate carbonium ion,1 4  1 5 '1 6  which is logical as  
VIb is partly isomerized into Via in aqueous acetic  
acid. Both Via and VIb would form the same car­
bonium ion (Vic), which would rearrange to ( — )-  
menthone or to (+)-isomenthone. In this case, the  
preponderance of (-)-menthone does not neces­
sarily mean that the rearrangement of Vic is  
favored with the formation of ( —  )-menthone, be­
cause an equilibration will occur between two iso­
meric menthones in acid media and ( —  )-menthone  
will dominate in the equilibration mixture.1 6

Lead tetraacetate cleavage  was carried out according to 
Criegee’s method,1 9  K2 0  > 1000 for Via and K2 0  = 9 for VIb.
Dehydration of  Via and VIb. A heterogeneous mixture of 
Via (1 g.) and 10% sulfuric acid (10 ml.) was refluxed 
for 2 hr. The resulting oil was extracted with ether, and the 
ether layer was washed with water and dried over mag­
nesium sulfate. The ether was removed and the residue was 
distilled to give a menthone mixture (VII) (yield 800 mg.),

Isomerization of  VIb to Via. A solution of VIb (500 mg.) 
in 50% aqueous acetic acid (5 ml.) containing 1  drop of 
sulfuric acid was heated under reflux for 1  hr. and extracted 
with ether. From this extract, an oil was obtained which was 
a mixture of diols and ketones. The diols were converted 
to the 3,5-dinitrobenzoates. The ketones were separated 
from the esters by steam distillation. The esters (250 mg.) 
were separated by repeated recrystallization from re-hexane 
into mono-3,5-dinitrobenzoate of Via (50 mg., m.p. 124- 
125°) and mono-3,5-dinitrobenzoate of VIb (100 mg., m.p.
142-143°). The ketone fraction was identified by infrared 
spectrum as a menthone mixture.

Methyl 1,1,2,2-ethanetetracarboxylate (bimalonic ester) can be alkylated only once, even though it contains two acidic 
hydrogen atoms. Failure to undergo a second alkylation is a result of steric hindrance. Replacement of both hydrogens 
when a difunctional alkylating agent is used results because the second step is intramolecular.
Bimalonic ester (I) contains two acidic hydro­
gen atoms, and replacements of both of these by  
use of dihalogen compounds have been used in  
synthesis of several cyclic substances. For ex­
ample methyl 1,1,2,2-cyclopentane tetracarbox-
ylate (II) has been obtained by alkylation with 1,3-  
dibromopropane.2

Use of monohalogen compounds has often led  
to low yields of poorly characterized products.3  
But it has now been found that these substances  
actually react quite satisfactorily, and alkylation  
products have been obtained using methyl iodide,  
ethyl iodide, n-butyl bromide, allyl bromide,  
benzyl chloride, and acrylonitrile.
It is interesting that only one of the acidic hy­
drogens of bimalonic ester can be replaced using  
these reagents. Even when a large excess of al­
kylating agent is used or when the monoalkylated  
product is isolated and treated again, a mono-  
alkylated product is obtained.
Resistance to dialkylation might be caused by  
low acidity of the monoalkylated bimalonic ester.  
Attempts to study this factor by the method of  
Pearson4  were unsuccessful because of low solu-

bilities of the compounds involved. But C-ethyl-  
bimalonic ester was brominated readily in pres­
ence of sodium methoxide, indicating that the  
ester did form an anion.
It is likely that resistance to dialkylation is  
simply a result of steric hindrance, for it is well  
known5  that even sec-alkylated malonic esters are  
difficult to alkylate, and a monoalkylated bi-  
malonic ester is sterically comparable to a tert- 
alkylated malonic ester. Double alkylation (cycli-  
zation) using dihalogen compounds succeeds be­
cause the second step in the reaction is intramolec­
ular. Here steric factors are of minor importance,  
for the reactive centers are in approximately  
proper position by virtue of the geometry of the  
molecule. It was possible that cyclizations occurred  
for another reason: Energy from the first alkylation  
was not dissipated rapidly but served to activate  
the molecule for the second step. This possibility  
has been eliminated by carrying out typical  
cyclizations in two separate stages. C-Allylbi-  
malonic ester (III) was treated with hydrogen  
bromide in presence of peroxide,6  and the resulting
7-bromopropylbimalonic ester was then converted  
to methyl 1,1,2,2-cyclopentanetetraearboxylate by  
action of sodium methoxide. C-Allylbimalonic  
ester was also treated with bromine, and the re­
sulting bromolactone (IV) was similarly cyclized  
to V. Structure of the latter product was proved  
by using hydrobromic acid, giving VI, a compound  
which furnished known trans-l, 2-cyclopentane di-  
carboxylic acid when it was dehalogenated with  
hydrogen in presence of palladium.

both sodium methoxide and halogen compound. For example,
13.1 g. of bimalonic ester was mixed with a solution of 2.3 g. 
of sodium in 55 ml. of methanol, and then 19 g. of benzyl 
chloride was added dropwise. The mixture was boiled for 
3 hr., then evaporated under reduced pressure, and steam 
distilled to remove excess benzyl chloride. Crystallization 
of the organic residue gave pure methyl 3-phenyl-1,1,2,2-

ucts were hydrolyzed and decarboxylated by boiling for 12 
hr. with excess constant-boiling hydrochloric acid, and the 
resulting substituted succinic acids (yields 80-90%) were 
identified by melting point and neutral equivalent. Results 
of the alkylations are given in Table I.
Acrylonitrile (5 ml.) and a few crystals of quinone were 
added to a solution of 2.6 g. of bimalonic ester in 15 ml. of

The synthesis of l,3-diphenyl-l,3-dihydroisothianaphthene-2,2-dioxide (IV), starting from o-dibenzoylbenzene, is de­
scribed. Pyrolysis of IV at 250° gives 9-phenyl-9,10-diiyydroanthracene (XII), rather than the expected l,2-diphen3d- 
benzocyclobutene (V). The existence of the intermediary quinodimethane (XV) was demonstrated bj- a Diels-Alder trapping
reaction.
Since the pyrolysis of 1,3-dihydroisothianaph-  
thene-2,2-dioxide (I) yields either benzocvclo-  
butene (II) or 1,2,5,6-dibenzocyclooctadiene (III),  
depending on the conditions used,1  the pyrolysis of
1,3 - diphenyl-1,3-dihydroisothianaphthene-2,2-di­
oxide (IV) was investigated as a possible route to
1,2-diphenylbenzocyclobutene (V).
Sulfone IV, m.p. 200-201°, was obtained by  
the peracetic acid oxidation of the known sulfide,
VI.2  Methods are described in the literature for  
each of the preceding synthetic steps, viz., the re­
duction of o-dibenzoylbenzene (VII) to 1,3-di-  
phenylisobenzofuran (VIII);3  the conversion of

IX to the sulfide, VI. However, since we ex­
perienced considerable difficulty in obtaining re­
producible results in all three of these reactions,  
modified preparations of VI and IX were developed,  
and these are reported in the Experimental section  
In addition, a new method is reported for the con­
version of o-dibenzoylbenzene (VII) into furan  
VIII by the partial reduction of VII with potassium  
borohydride, followed by treatment of the primary  
reduction product (X) with acid. The success of  
this procedure is probably due to the tendency of  
the intermediary ketoalcohol, X, to exist mostly  
as the phthalan (XI)5  in the basic reduction  
medium. Even so, good yields of VIII could be ob-

tained only by treating VII alternately with boro-  
hydride and mineral acid, thereby avoiding the  
accumulation of large amounts of the intermediate  
in the reaction mixture. It may be noted that furan  
VIII was found to be completely stable under the  
conditions of the reduction.
When the pyrolysis of sulfone IV was carried  
out in diethyl phthalate at 250°, neither 1,2-di-  
phenylbenzocyclobutene (V) nor a dimer of this  
substance was obtained. There was isolated  
instead, in 94% yield, 9-phenyl-9,10-dihydroan-  
thracene (XII), the constitution of which was con­
firmed by dehydrogenation to 9-phenylanthracene  
with the mild reagent, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-
1,4-benzoquinone.6  The thermal decomposition  
of sulfone IV therefore follows a course analogous  
to that of l,l,3-triphenyl-l,3-dihydroisothianaph-  
thene-2,2-dioxide (XIV)7 ’ 8  which similarly yields  
anthracene derivatives by intramolecular rear­
rangement of the primary pyrolysis product.9  
The great ease with which the expected pyrolysis  
intermediate XV rearranges to 9-phenyl-9,10-  
dihydroanthraceno is demonstrated by an experi­
ment in which sulfone IV was pyrolyzed at 250°  
in the presence of an excess of 1,4-naphthoquinone.  
Diels-Alder addition of the intermediary quino-  
methane XV to 1,4-naphthoquinone did indeed  
occur, as shown by the isolation in 42% yield of
6,1 l-diphenyl-5,12-naphthacenequinone (XVII).1 0

XV failed to react with the naphthoquinone, as  
evidenced by the isolation in 20% yield of the  
aromatized rearrangement product, 9-phenyl­
anthracene (XIII).
During the course of this work a successful  
synthesis of 1,2-diphenylbenzocyclobutene (V)  
was reported.1 1  The diphenyl derivative was found  
to be remarkably reactive; on heating, it rear­
ranged to 9-phenyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene (XII),  
probably via the transient intermediate XV.  
In addition, it reacted with sulfur dioxide under  
surprisingly mild conditions to yield a sulfone
(XVIII), m.p. 232.5-234° dec.; this sulfone differs  
from our sulfone IV which has a melting point of  
200-201° dec.,1 2  yet it gives the same pyrolysis  
product, hydrocarbon XII. The two sulfones, IV  
and XVIII, are apparently related as cis-trans  
isomers. Sulfone IV and its precursor, sulfide VI,  
are probably trans  isomers, since VI is derived from  
the isothianaphthene IX by a metal and acid  
reduction, a process which may favor the forma­
tion of the thermodynamically stable trans  product.  
Furthermore, the sulfone derived from 1,2-di­
phenylbenzocyclobutene and sulfur dioxide, i.e.

pressed (185-193°) upon admixture with sulfone XVIII, 
and the infrared spectra of the two sulfones differ in the 
8-15 fi range. We are indebted to Dr. F. R. Jensen for a 
comparison sample of authentic sulfone XVIII.

sulfone XVIII, might be expected to be the cis 
isomer, since sulfur dioxide probably adds in a con­
certed manner to quinodimethane XV, or at  
least takes part in a transition state approaching  
structure XV. It is to be noted that, of the various  
cis and trans  isomers which can be drawn for XV,  
only isomer XVa, which would give a cis-sulfone  
when treated with sulfur dioxide, fulfills the steric  
requirements for full resonance stabilization as a  
coplanar structure. Indeed, mild thermal isomeri­
zation of XVa would lead to structure XVb which  
would have not only less orbital overlap stabiliza­
tion, but a more favorable conformation for  
subsequent intramolecular ring closure to form

canary-yellow in acid and orange-yellow in base, was used 
as an internal indicator.) After stirring and refluxing the 
basic solution for 10 min., a second 2-ml. portion of boro­
hydride solution was added, reduction was again allowed 
for 1  min. and was then stopped, as before, with acid. The 
entire cycle was repeated five times in toto.  After the final 
reduction step, the reaction mixture was treated with 60 ml. 
of aqueous 1.5A * sulfuric acid, heated on the steam bath 
for 15 min., cooled, and filtered with suction. The crude 
product (bright yellow flakes) was dried and leached with 
100 ml. of warm petroleum ether (b.p. 55-60°) to give 2.1 
g. (78%) of the product, 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran, m.p. 
130-131° (reported3  m.p. 126°), which was obtained in three 
crops.
l.S-Diphenylisolhianaphlhene  (IX). In a 250-ml., one- 
neck, round-bottom flask provided with a 1-inch magnetic 
stirring bar and two dozen 6-mm. glass beads were placed 
150 ml. of carbon disulfide and 2 g. of phosphorus penta- 
sulfide. The phosphorus pentasulfide was finely dispersed in 
the carbon disulfide by 1  hr.’s rapid stirring with the glass 
beads. 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran (1.0 g., 3.7 mmoles) was 
then added, and stirring was continued for 12 hr. at room 
temperature, in the dark, and under dry nitrogen. Another 
2-g. portion of phosphorus pentasulfide was added, and stir­
ring was resumed for a second 12-hr. period. The product 
was isolated by Dufraisse’s method4 : thus, the reaction 
mixture was filtered with suction, the filtrate w ras evaporated 
to dryness in vacuo;  the residue was extracted with two 100- 
ml. portions of benzene, and the extract was refluxed for 4 
hr. with 100 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution 
in order to remove inorganic sulfides. The resulting clear 
benzene layer was separated, dried over sodium sulfate, 
treated with a solution of 500 mg. of maleic anhydride in 5 
ml. of benzene to remove unchanged starting material, 
allowed to stand for 30 sec., and finally was washed thor­
oughly with three 50-ml. portions of 5% aqueous sodium 
hydroxide solution. The organic layer was again dried over 
sodium sulfate and was then evaporated to dryness in vacuo.  
Recrvstallization of the residue from ethanol gave 0.64 g.

1.3- Diphenyl-l,3-dihydroisothianaphthene  (VI). To a rapidly 
stirred solution of 100 mg. (0.35 mmole) of 1,3-diphenyliso- 
thianaphthene in 20 ml. of warm glacial acetic acid was added 
15 g. of amalgamated zinc dust.1 4  The resulting suspension 
was stirred rapidly for 5 min. at 80-85°; 5 ml. of coned, 
hydrochloric acid was then added all at once, and reduction 
was allowed to proceed for 1  to 1.5 min. The almost colorless 
reaction mixture was quickly filtered with suction, and the 
filtrate was diluted with hot water until a persistent cloudi­
ness was observed. The filtrate was cooled to 15° to give 65 
mg. (64.5%) of l,3-diphenyl-l,3-dihydroisothianaphthene. 
Recrystallization from ethanol-water gave long white 
needles, m.p. 107-108° (reported2  m.p. 106.5-107.5°, 29% 
yield).
1.3- Diphenyl-l ,3-dihydroisothianaphthene-2,2-dioxide  (IV). 
A solution of 2.0 g. (7.0 mmoles) of l,3-diphenyl-l,3- 
dihydroisothianaphthene in 50 ml. of glacial acetic acid 
was added dropwise over a period of 30 min. to 20 ml. of 
commercial (Becco) 40% peracetic acid kept at 25°. The 
reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature 
for 2 days and was then treated with 50 ml. of water to give
1.86 g. of small white needles. Concentration of the mother 
liquor gave a second crop (260 mg.). Recrystallization of the 
product from methylene chloride-petroleum ether (b.p. 35- 
55°) gave a total yield of 2.01 g. (90%) of l,3-diphenyl-l,3- 
dihydroisothianaphthene-2,2-dioxide, obtained as fine white 
needles, m.p. 200-201° dec.

Pyrolysis of 1,3-diphenyl-l,3-dihydroisolhianaphlhene-2,2-  
dioxide.  A solution of 160 mg. (0.5 mmole) of dioxide IV in 
100 ml. of diethyl phthalate was heated in an oil bath at 
250° under a slow stream of nitrogen. The nitrogen-sulfur 
dioxide gas mixture from the reaction vessel was bubbled 
through an aqueous solution containing an equivalent 
amount (0.5 mmole) of iodine (prepared from 5 ml. of 0.03d/ 
potassium iodate, 1  ml. of saturated potassium iodide solu­
tion, and 10 drops of 6.V hydrochloric acid). When the 
iodine solution had been decolorized (heating time, 45 
min.), the reaction mixture was poured into 200 ml. of 5% 
alcoholic potassium hydroxide. The resulting soap slurry 
was allowed to stand in a water bath at 50° for 12 hr. It 
was then evaporated almost to dryness in vacuo,  dissolved 
in 200 ml. of water, and extracted with four 50-ml. portions 
of petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°). The combined organic 
extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated to 
dryness in vacuo  to give 150 mg. of crude product. Chro­
matography on Grade I neutral alumina (Woclm) with 1:4 
ether-benzene, followed by recrvstallization from ethanol, 
gave 120 mg. (94%) of pure 9-pheny 1-9,10-dihydroanthra- 
cene (XII), m.p. 86-87° (reported1 5  m.p. 87- 88°). The 
dihydro compound was characterized further by conversion 
into 9-phcnylanthracene (XIII): thus, a solution of 11.5 
mg. (0.045 mmole) of 9-phenyl-9,10-dihydroanthraeene in 
2 ml. of benzene was mixed with a solution of approximately 
35 mg. (0.15 mmole) of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzo- 
quinone6  in 6 ml. of benzene and warmed in a water bath 
(75°) for 1.5 hr. The reaction mixture was evaporated to 
dryness under an air jet, and the residue was triturated with 
1  ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) and then extracted 
twice with the same solvent. Chromatography of the extract
(14) The amalgamated zinc dust was prepared by shaking 
50 g. of zinc dust with 100 ml. of 1.5% aqueous ammonium 
chloride solution for 15 min., adding 150 ml. of saturated 
aqueous mercuric chloride solution, shaking for another 15- 
min. period, and then washing by decanting with four 100- 
ml. portions of distilled water. The amalgam was allowed to 
stand for 24 hr. under the last wash water and was filtered 
with suction just before use.

The benzene ring of aniline has not undergone chlorination by addition in the past because the electron-releasing amine 
group enables substitution to take place too readily. The use of two electron-withdrawing acyl groups attached to the amine 
group in aniline did not enable addition-chlorination to take place. Instead, monodeacetylation took place, followed by 
substitution-chlorination of the acetanilide to 2,4-dichloroacetanilide. The use of non-cleavable electron-withdrawing 
groups permitted addition-chlorination to take place readily. Thus, phenyl isocyanate and A ’-phenylimidocarbonyl chloride 
were chlorinated by addition in good yields. Hydrolysis of the addition products suggests that the major stable product 
from any attempted addition-chlorination of aniline would be 2,4,6-trichloroaniline.
In our previous paper on the addition-chlorin­
ation of phenol,1  we demonstrated that the com­
bination of the phenolic oxygen atom with groups  
exerting a negative inductive effect permits addi­
tion-chlorination of the benzene ring to take place  
readily. Thus, phenyl trichloroacetate was addi­
tion-chlorinated in near quantitative yields.
Aniline, like phenol, contains a strong electron­
releasing atom, and readily undergoes substitution  
chlorination, even in the absence of catalyses.  
It was the purpose of this work to add chlorine to  
the benzene ring of an aniline derivative, and to  
determine the nature of the product of the addi­
tion-chlorination of aniline. The direct addition-  
chlorination of aniline was not attempted because  
of its ease of substitution, and because the expected  
product is a gem-chloroamine, II, an unstable  
structure which would not be identifiable.
It is known that the single acetylation of aniline  
diminishes the ortho-para -orienting power of the  
acetylated group, but does not reduce it suffi­
ciently for meta  orientation of an incoming group  
to take place. In another instance, it is known that  
the single acylation of nitrogen, as in aceto-p-  
toluidide, is not sufficient to reduce the orienting
(1) I. Rosen and J. P. Stallings, J. Org. Chem.,  24, 1523
(1959).power of the acylamine group below that of the  
methyl group. However, double acylation is suf­
ficient to enable the methyl group to take control.2
In view of the above information, it seemed likely  
that a doubly acylated amine group would be less  
ortho-para  directing than the singly acylated group.  
It was expected that the deactivation of the nucleus  
would reduce the rate of the substitution chlorina­
tion reaction and permit addition-chlorination to  
take place more readily. Attempts were made to  
addition-ehlorinate diacetanilide and <Y,a,a-tri-  
fluorwliacetanilide. It was hoped that the presence  
of the halogens on the acetyl group would also  
tend to reduce the ortho-para  orientation by virtue  
of their added inductive effect in this system. The  
diacetanilide, together with carbon tetrachloride  
and the theoretical amount of chlorine for addition,  
was sealed in a borosilicate glass tube and exposed  
to ultraviolet irradiation. Some activation is needed  
for the reaction to take place; there is no reaction  
in the dark. With both starting materials, the same  
product, 2,4-dichloroacetanilide, was isolated in  
fair yields. It was assumed that this product was  
formed predominantly via the reaction scheme  
shown below, involving cleavage of an acyl group

and subsequent substitution of the benzene ring.  
The conversion of the iV-chloroacetanilide to the  
ring chlorinated product can take place via the  
Orton rearrangement, or by a homolytic mechanism

A diacylated aniline can be very readily cleaved to  
a monoacylated aniline.4  Once hydrochloric acid  
is formed in the reaction, some of the diacetanilide  
will be cleaved to acetanilide, which can then  
undergo a substitution reaction with chlorine.
Although one of the two acyl groups is readily  
cleaved, the remaining one is fairly stable. In order  
to avoid this cleavage and still try to maintain the  
reduced ortho-para  directing power of the nitrogen  
atom, one of the acyl groups was replaced by a  
methyl group. The use of the compound, IV-methyl,  
a,a,a-trichloroacetanilide, under conditions suit­
able for addition-chlorination, however, resulted  
only in a substitution reaction. For the conditions  
used, this means of achieving control over the nitro­
gen atom’s electron-releasing properties proved in­
effective.
In order to overcome the deficiencies in the pre­
ceding systems, it was apparently necessary to use  
a non-cleavable electron-withdrawing group at­
tached to the amine. Thus, phenyl isocyanate was  
chosen as the next material for chlorination. The  
nitrogen atom in this molecule has a reduced ortho­
para  orienting power compared with that in aniline.  
Because of the decreased tendency for substitution  
in the benzene ring, it was hoped that the addition-  
chlorination could compete with the substitution-  
chlorination.
The benzene ring of phenyl isocyanate was readily  
addition-chlorinated in good yield. The addition-  
chlorinated product still possessed the isocyanate  
group intact. The product was identified by its  
elemental analysis and by its hydrolyzable chlorine  
content. The structure was confirmed by infrared  
analysis. The infrared spectrum of this product  
contained a strong absorption band at 2260 cm.-1  
for the isocyanate group, and no absorption bands  
for the benzene ring. The product was thus identi­
fied as 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexyl isocyanate.
The by-product of this chlorination appeared to  
be p-chlorophenylcarbamoyl chloride. This material  
has been obtained previously by others by the

Tatlow, J. Chem. Soc.,  4014 (1952).reaction of chlorine with phenyl isocyanate in both  
carbon tetrachloride and chloroform, but no physi­
cal properties were reported.5 ’ 6  The structure of  
the by-product was indicated by its elemental  
analysis and by its hydrolyzable chlorine content,  
and confirmed by infrared analysis. The infrared  
spectrum contained strong absorption bands at  
1780 cm.-1 and 1530 cm.-1, assignable to a car­
bon yl adjacent to an electronegative group, and  
to N—H stretch, respectively.
An extension of the above work on addition-  
chlorination involved the substitution of another  
electron-withdrawing group (chlorine) for the  
oxygen in the isocyanate. This change was made  
to determine if the ortho-para  orienting power would  
still be reduced sufficiently to enable addition-  
chlorination to take place. The inductive effect of  
the two chlorine atoms should decrease the avail­
ability of the nitrogen electrons toward participa­
tion in ring activation. The A r -phenylimidocarbonyl
a  ^ C 1N=±CC
Cl
chloride was prepared by a published method.7  
It readily underwent the addition of chlorine to  
the benzene ring to yield 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachloro-  
cyclohexylimidocarbonyl chloride. This compound  
was identified by elemental and infrared analyses.  
The infrared spectrum contained a strong band at  
1680 cm.-1 for C = N  stretch, and no absorption  
bands for the benzene ring.
In order to get some idea as to what the addi­
tion-chlorinated product of aniline might be, the  
1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexyl isocyanate was  
treated with dilute hydrochloric acid. Normally,  
the use of dilute acid converts an aromatic iso­
cyanate into a mixture of aromatic amine and urea.  
The product which was obtained in our hydrolysis  
was 2,4,6-trichloroaniline (66% crude yield).

is represented by the above sequence of steps.  
In the first step, the isocyanate, I, should be hy­
drolyzed to the gem-chloroamine, II, which is the  
product of the addition-chlorination of aniline.  
The < 7fm-chloroamine, II, then should undergo  
dehydrochlorination to the 2,3,4,5 6-pentachloro-  
cyclohexylimine, III, and then probably to a  
dienimine such as IV. Finally, IV should rapidly  
undergo rearrangement to the product, V. An in­
ference of the results is that if aniline were addition-  
chlorinated to II, II would probably undergo the  
same dehydrochlorination path and sequence of  
steps and yield V as the major stable product.

placed 1.000 g. (0.0030 mole) of I, 18 ml. of 6.Y  aqueous 
hydrochloric acid, and 18 ml. of 95% ethanol. Upon warm­

for 3 hr. the solution had turned deep red and a small 
amount of sediment had accumulated. The mixture was 
cooled and filtered. The filtrate was made basic with I N 
sodium hydroxide and extracted with three 50-ml. portions 
of ether. The ether extracts were combined, dried, and 
evaporated. The residue weighed 0.371 g. and was re­
crystallized from re-hexane. The crystals of 2,4,6-trichloro- 
aniline weighed 0.257 g. (44%), m.p. 77.5-79.0°. Mixture 
with an authentic sample of 2,4,6-trichloroaniline did not 
depress the melting point.

The bromination of ethyl p-i-butyl-/S-cyano-a-hydroxycinnamate (I) in dry carbon tetrachloride gives an intermediate 
dibromide (II) and a monobromide (III) each of which is converted to p-£-butylphenylhydroxymaleimide by appropriate 
means. When the single reactive hydrogen in the enolic group of I is blocked by an ethyl group, the reaction with bromine 
does not take place and the ethyl ether of I is recovered unchanged. The experiments performed in the determination of the 
structure of the bromides are described and their significance is discussed.
Previous studies in this laboratory have indicated  
that bromine reacts with chloroform solutions of  
/3-cyano-a-hydroxycinnamic esters in the presence  
of water to give p-bromoarylhydroxymaleimides.  
If the para  position is blocked, cyclization occurs  
but bromine does not enter the ring . 1 If all ortho  
and para  positions are substituted by methyl  
groups, an amide ester results in which the bromine  
is in the alpha  position in the side chain. This is  
reminiscent of the similar behavior of ethyl cyano-  
methylpyruvate 2 and is a further indication that  
bromine first enters the side chain.
This work was undertaken for the purpose of  
the isolation and characterization of the interme­
diate reaction products in order to establish more  
definitely the course of the reaction. For this  
purpose we selected I, as it contains no easily dis­
placeable hydrogen except that of the enolic group  
and this can be removed from the sphere of action  
by prior formation of the ether. Carefully purified  
carbon tetrachloride and dried reagents were used  
and the experiment was conducted under protection  
from outside moisture. The dibromide (II) precipi­
tated relatively rapidly in a few hours and the  
monobromide (III) from the filtrate relatively  
slowly in a few weeks.

The dibromide was stable in vacuo  over potas­
sium hydroxide and phosphorus pentoxide for at  
least seven months and, therefore, does not seem  
to be a molecular complex. It was quite reactive  
toward either water or ethyl alcohol. Either reagent  
converted it to p-f-butylphenylhydroxymaleimide.  
It reacted with toluene to give benzyl bromide but  
upon standing with benzene free bromine was  
literated.Hydrolysis of the dibromide in alcoholic potas­
sium hj^droxide gave p-i-butylphenylaeetamide  
which was also formed by similar hydrolj'sis 1 
of the hydroxymaleimide. Under these conditions  
it is probable that the hydrolysis proceeds through  
the intermediate formation of the hydroxymale­
imide. On the other hand, if the dibromide were  
added to hot aqueous potassium hydroxide and the  
hydrolysis then completed, p-f-butvlmandelic acid  
was the only identified product. This indicates the  
direct hydrolysis of the dibromide, that one of the  
bromine atoms is joined to the carbon alpha  to the  
aromatic ring, and that both are capable of hy­
drolytic cleavage.
The dibromide is neither a molecular complex  
nor a simple addition product of bromine to the  
starting ester (I), as cyclohexene removed the bro­
mine to give 1,2-dibromocyclohexane without re­
generating the starting ester. It contains carbon-  
bromine bonds 3 as shown by infrared absorption  
bands at 17.5 and 18.2 p with overtones at 8 . 8 and  
9.2 n.
The monobromide is considerably more stable  
than the dibromide, as it could be crystallized from  
carbon tetrachloride as well as chromatographed  
in chloroform solution. The bromine atom, how­
ever, is a reactive one which liberated iodine from  
a solution of sodium iodide in acetone and also gave  
an immediate precipitate with acidified alcoholic  
silver nitrate. The compound is not an enol, as it  
did not give the characteristic color with ferric  
chloride but when the solution was warmed a deep  
orange color developed. The almost white color  
of the monobromide is also in agreement with that  
of a series 4 of 1,4,4-trialkylpyrollidinetriones. The  
hydroxymaleimides are all colored yellow.
The monobromide by hydrolysis in aqueous  
potassium hydroxide gave p-£-butylmandelic acid  
as well as oxalic acid. This indicates that the bro­
mine atom is at a position alpha  to the aromatic  
nucleus. The products of this hydrolysis indicate  
especially that the monobromide is 4-bromo-4-

p-I-butylphenylpyrrolidinetrione (III). In this con­
nection, if the bromine atom were replaced with  
hydrogen, p-i-butylphenylhydroxymaleimide was  
formed. This reaction was carried out in excellent  
yield by heating the dibromide with toluene to  
form also benzyl bromide.
The assigned structure of the monobromide is  
further supported by the infrared 5 spectrum which  
shows a band at 3.16 n that is attributed to the N-H  
bond. Bands arising from the carbonyl functions are  
also present at 5.52, 5.58, and 5.83 n. This splitting  
to form a doublet at 5.52 and 5.84 p probably re­
sults from the two carbonyl functions involved in  
the imide structure.
One of the bromine atoms in the dibromide also  
must be in the alpha  position to the aromatic nu­
cleus as the dibromide, in a separate experiment un­
der identical conditions, was converted to this  
monobromide. This conclusion is further supported  
by the fact that aqueous alkaline hydrolysis of the  
dibromide gave the identical p-i-butylmandelic  
acid.
The above behavior of the dibrcmide and its  
relation to the monobromide indicate very strongly  
that the two bromine atoms are vicinal. The for­
mation of a debromination product different from  
the original ester can be explained by the loss and  
readdition of hydrogen bromide to the nitrile func­
tion. As support for this interpretation of the re­
action may be cited the fact that the ethyl ether

(IV) of the starting ester did not react with bro­
mine in anhydrous carbon tetrachloride although  
it was converted to p-i-butylphenylethoxymale-  
imide by hydrochloric acid in alcohol. The ether  
contains no reactive hydrogen to form hydrogen  
bromide. This explains why the ether did not re­
act with bromine under these conditions.
Bromine did not react with p-r-butylphenyl-  
hydroxymaleimide to give the monobromide. Its  
formation most likely proceeds through the par­
tially hydrolyzed dibromide (V), which has not  
been isolated in this case. The water necessary for  
this reaction may have become slowly available  
through the ground glass joints or, more likely, by  
oxidation, as the dibromide was converted to the  
hvdroxymaleimide by ethanol as well as by water.

(5) Consultation with Dr. H. C. Beachell.dimerization product of a ketenimine but a com­
pound which also requires water for its formation.  
Its analysis and molecular weight indicate that it  
is derived from two molecules of the starting ester  
and that the molecular formula is C 30H35O7N2. 
This bimolecular compound on hydrolysis with  
aqueous potassium hydroxide ultimately yielded  
only p-i-butylphenylacetic acid. Reaction with  
hot 30% sulfuric acid gave one mole of p-f-butyl-  
phenylhydroxymaleimide and some p - t - butyl-  
phenylpyruvic acid also. The distillate contained  
ammonia and gave a positive iodoform test. The  
reaction of the bimolecular compound with al­
coholic hydrochloric acid gave more than one mole  
of p-bbutylphenylhydroxymaleimide. In addition  
there was obtained a small amount of the ethyl  
ether of the hydroxymaleimide.
As the bimolecular compound was formed in  
spite of careful exclusion of w r ater in the reaction of  
cyclohexene with the dibromide, the water needed  
for partial reaction must have arisen within the  
medium. This necessity for wrnter is borne out by  
the fact that the addition of a very small amount of  
water to the filtrate, from the bimolecular com­
pound. yielded more of it in considerable amount .
More than one mole of p-f-butylphenylacetic  
acid w r as obtained on alkaline hydrolysis, which  
indicates that both moieties of the bimolecular  
compound must be capable of hydrolysis to this  
acid. The reaction with 30% sulfuric acid gives a  
strong indication that one part of the molecule  
was furnished by p-i-butylphenylhydroxymale-  
imide. This must be joined to another part which is  
capable of acid hydrolysis to p-/-butylphenylpyru-  
vic acid. The amount of this acid under identical  
conditions from the hydroxymaleimide was far  
less.
The reaction of the bimolecular compound with  
hydrogen chloride in ethanol to give more than one  
mole of the hydroxymaleimide shows that both  
parts of the molecule vr ere converted to p-f-butyl-  
phenvlhydroxymaleimide. The fact that p-i-butyl-  
phenylethoxymaleimide also was isolated while  
none T ,vas obtained from the hydroxymaleimide  
under identical conditions shovr s that only the  
other part of the molecule is capable of yielding  
this ether.
The starting ester is converted to the hydroxy­
maleimide by bromine with free access of water . 1  
Although we apparently have failed in our efforts  
to keep all moisture from the reaction mixture  
during the debromination with cyclohexene, we  
have succeeded in preventing complete conversion  
of the intermediate to the hydroxymaleimide.

In 6-7 min. brick-red crystals began to separate. After 24

The dibromide (2.5 g.; 0.0058 mole) was added to a refluxing 
mixture of 20 cc. of ethanol and 3 cc. of 40% potassium 
hydroxide solution. A yellow solid formed immediately. 
Heating was continued for 28 hr. during which 9 cc. of water 
and 4-5 pellets of potassium hydroxide were added. The 
solution was cooled and the white precipitate was filtered 
and washed with 2:1 ethanol-water to give 0.9 g. of potas­
sium oxalate. The residue from the evaporation of the 
filtrate gave a white solid soluble in ether that after two 
recrystallizations from benzene-ligroin had a melting point 
of 125.5-127° which was not depressed by an authentic 
sample of p-f-butylphenylacetamide, m.p. 126-127°. The 
above basic solution upon acidification gave a viscous oil 
which could not be induced to crystallize.

To a stirred hot solution of 1.7 g. of potassium hydroxide in20 cc. of water was added 1.5 g. (0.0035 mole) of the di- 
bromide. Immediately there was formed a yellow solid which 
gradually changed to an oil that remained after refluxing 2 
hr. Alcohol (6.5 cc.) was added and the heating was continued 
for 36 hr. The solution was extracted with ether to remove a 
drop or two of a dark oil. The acid from the aqueous layer 
amounted to 0.8 g. of a brown oil which after long standing 
deposited crystals that were filtered and washed with pen­
tane. Two recrystallizations from benzene gave 0.025 g. 
of p-i-butylmandelic acid, m.p. 149-150°, lit .,6 m.p. 149.5-

(0.50 g.) was allowed to stand 5 months in an all-glass con­

p-f-butylhydroxymaleimide ( 0.22 g.) and ammonium bro­
mide ( 0.02 g.) from the precipitate and from the toluene 
free bromine and 0.1 g. of a lachrymator which was identi­

sociated bromine almost immediately. After 3 days the solid 
(0.23 g.) was filtered and identified as the hydroxymale­
imide, m.p. 248-250°. The red liquid distillate of bromine 
and benzene required 4-5 drops of cyclohexene for de- 
colorization. A reddish tar (0.25 g.) remained in the residue.

pose the dibromide was prepared from 9.1 g. (0.033 mole) 
of the starting ester. When the precipitation appeared com­
plete (6 hr.) the red dibromide was filtered and washed in 
the Mini Lab with three 9-cc. portions of dry carbon tetra­
chloride. Then 13 cc. of carbon tetrachloride was stirred 
into a smooth paste. Cj-clohexene (5 cc.) freshly distilled 
from sodium in a nitrogen atmosphere was added at once 
with good stirring. The temperature rose to 30-35° and solu­
tion was complete in 1 min. except for a minute amount of 
solid dispersed in the light wine-colored liquid. The pre­
cipitation of a yellow solid began in 5 min. and was essen­
tially complete in 15 min. After standing 45 min. longer, 
the product was filtered and washed with 8-ce. portions of 
carbon tetrachloride. It was crystallized from ethanol to 
yield 1.1 g. of yellow fibrous material which began to darken 
at 2 10° and melted at 220-222° dec.
The mother liquor, from which the yellow solid precipi­
tated, was shaken with 1  cc. of water. Within 1  min. a 
yellow solid started to separate. The mixture was allowed 
to stand 3 hr. after which the yellow solid was filtered and 
washed well with carbon tetrachloride. Crystallization from 
ethanol gave 0.7 g. more of the identical compound, m.p.

of lack of solubility: borneol, camphene, naphthalene,

was evolved. The colorless solution was evaporated to half

petroleum ether (b.p. 00-00°) melted at 79-80°. Admixture 
with an authentic sample of p-i-butylphenylacetic acid 
showed no depression in the melting point. The aqueous

and washed at room temperature, teas heated with 20 cc. of 
ligroin containing 1 cc. of benzene and filtered hot, then 
washed several times with hot ligroin to give 0.58 g. which 
from toluene gave 0.46 g. of p-i-butylphonjfihydroxj'male-

From the ligroin filtrate there was obtained 0.08 g. of

m.p. 164-165°. Likewise from the above toluene filtrate 
there was obtained 0.05 g., m.p. 164-165°. Mixed with an

The original arid filtrate afforded a distillate which gave

Further concentration gave 0.25 g. The combined product 
was washed with a little benzene and crystallized from 
toluene, yield 0.50 g., m.p. 248-250°. Ammonium chloride 
(0.05 g.) was filtered from the hot toluene solution.
The above benzene washings w rere evaporated to an oil

into a flask equipped with a tightly fitting glass stopper and 
allowed to stand in the closed flask. Red crystals slowly

This -was chromatographed on a 1 1/8 in. column using 25

p-/-butylphenylhydroxymaleimide and the lower broad 
almost white band gave 2.8 g. of III, m.p. 163-165°. The 
ethanol solution of III made acid with nitric acid gave an

Through the condensation of /3-arylglutaconic anhydrides with phenolic ethers in the presence of anhydrous aluminum 
chloride, a series of /S-aryl- 7-benzoylcrotonic acids and their lactones were prepared. In addition, a general method for the 
synthesis of £ 1 ,-/-substituted benzoylbutyric acids has been developed. These acids after reduction and lactonization gave 
the corresponding /3,5-substituted valerolactones. The crotono- and valerolactones are being tested for their anthelmintic 
activity and for their perfumery properties.
Though the relationship between chemical con­
stitution and anthelmintic effect has not been fully  
elucidated, a number of the anthelmintics have been  
found which possess a lactonic group . 3 A detailed  
study by Rosenmund 4 and Nargund 6 has indicated  
that some arylbutyrolactones possess good an­
thelmintic effect. Moreover, unsaturation in the  
lactone ring has been shown to enhance the anthel­
mintic activity . 6 8  9
These findings have led us to prepare a number of  
unsaturated lactones with different aryl substit­
uents (Type I) for testing their anthelmintic  
effects.

sumed a great importance in the field of perfumery.  
Many naturally occurring lactones and their syn­
thetic substitutes have been extensively studied  
in the light of their perfumery values .7 - 9 The varia­
tion in odor of lactone has been studied as a func­
tion of the substituents attached to the lactone and,  
accordingly, a series of a and -/-substituted 7- 
butyrolactones were prepared . 10 Even the variation  
in intensity of odor with increase in the size of the  
lactonic ring was studied . 11 However, as yet, no  
definite relationship between the structure of a  
lactone and the intensity of its odor has been de­
termined. It was therefore thought interesting to  
study the lactones (I) from the perfumery value  
point of view and attempt to gain some knowl­
edge concerning the relationship between structure  
and odor intensity.
In the present work, condensation of (1) /? -  
(4-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-, (2) /3-(2-methoxy-4-  
methylphenyl)- and (3) /3-(4-methoxy-2-methyl-5-  
isopropylphenyl(glutaconic anhydrides in nitro­
benzene with an equimolar quantity of anisole in  
the presence of anhydrous aluminum chloride was  
effected following the observation of Bhave . 12 
From this reaction, two distinct products were  
isolated. The predominant product (80% yield)  
was a neutral compound and by analogy with

earlier work in our laboratory1 2 '1 3  was the /3-aryl-  
7-4-methoxybenzoylcrotonolactone (I). From the  
mother liquor of I, an acid product (10% yield)  
was isolated by treatment with dilute hydrochloric  
acid. It proved to be a monobasic acid by titration  
and it was shown to be ketonic in nature as evi­
denced through the formation of a semicarbazone  
and a phenylhydrazone. Its elementary analysis  
was also indicative of the structure II.

In an attempt to open the lactonic ring of I to  
produce II, I was treated with sodium ethoxide in  
ethanol. The resulting product was, however, a  
neutral ketone (III) which gave a crystalline phen­
ylhydrazone. The same product (III) was ob­
tained by decarboxylation of II, suggesting that  
probably under the conditions of the experiment,  
sodium ethoxide brought about hydrolysis and sub-

holic alkali, however, resulted predominantly in  
the formation of II (70-75% yield) and a small  
percentage (6-8%) of III. The keto acid (II) could  
be reconverted to the starting lactone I by treat­
ment with mineral acid or acetic anhydride.

glutaconic anhydrides, /3-aryl-Y-benzoylbutyric  
acids (IV, Table I) and not the lactones (V) were the  
only products isolated from the reaction. These  
acids were characterized through elementary analy­

1.1 g. ( 0.01 mole) of anisole in 10 ml. of freshly distilled 
nitrobenzene, in a dry flask equipped with an air condenser 
carrying a calcium chloride tube, 3 g. of freshly powdered 
anhydrous aluminum chloride was added in portions during 
a period of about 30 min. The reaction was exothermic and 
the temperature was controlled (15-20°) by immersing the 
reaction flask in a cold water bath. The mixture was stirred 
at room temperature for 4 hr., and then the resulting dark 
red mixture was poured slowly into 100 ml. of ice-cold waiter

nitrobenzene was removed by distillation and the residue 
collected, washed with water, and then treated with 10% 
sodium carbonate solution. From the alkaline filtrate 0.15

The alkylation of sodium 2-phenylethoxide with benzyl chloride produces, in addition to the expected ether, 2-benzyl-2,3 
diphenylpropanol. This abnormal reaction results from the presence of aldehydes or other phenylaeetaldehvde precursors. 
Thus, the course of the reaction probably involves a sequence of oxidation-reduction steps and the successive alkylations of 
aldehyde enolates. In one experiment, with 3-phenylpropanol, the intermediate 2,2-dibenzyl-3-phenylpropanal was isolated. 
The abnormal alkylation has been accomplished also with 2-phenylethanol and allyl chloride and with 4-phenylbutanol and 
benzyl chloride. The products demonstrate that dialkylation is the rule and that only the 6 carbon atom is involved.
Some years ago it was shown that the reaction of  
sodium 2-phenylethoxide with benzyl chloride in  
toluene produced not only the ether but also a  
surprising quantity of the carbon-alkylation prod­
uct, 2-benzyl-2,3-diphenylpropanol.2  Subsequently,  
it was shown that this result could not be due to the  
presence of a carbanion which would be tautomeric  
with the phenylethoxide ion.3  It was also demon­
strated that freshly prepared alcohols such as
2,3-diphenylbutanol and 2,3-diphenylpropanol gave  
only the O-benzyl derivatives, and further that ben­
zyl 2-phenyiethyl ether, under the conditions of  
abnormal benzylation, gave none of the unusual  
alcohol.4  *
The fact that we were unable to perform the  
second stage of benzylation on the latter two alco­
hols, and indeed that we could :iot alkylate any  
but aged samples of 2-phenylethanol itself led to  
the investigation of aldehydes as possible pro­
moters of the abnormal alkylation. With phenyl-  
acetaldehyde, up to 5 mole %, it was not possible  
to produce the C-alkylation product in high yield;  
but with benzaldehyde or ketones which cannot  
themselves be destroyed through aldol condensa­
tion, excellent yields were obtained as shown in  
Table I. For each of the promoters there was an  
optimum concentration at about 7.6 mole % (based  
on the alcohol) and best results were encountered  
when the aldehyde or ketone was added slowly  
as a solution in the alkylating agent.
It appears most reasonable that the reaction  
sequence involves the production of phenylacet-  
aldehyde followed by the alkylation of its enolate  
ion; subsequent proton removal, a second alkyla­
tion, and finally, reduction completes the chain of  
events with regeneration of the promoter (or its  
equivalent). The minimum numoer of equations  
required to express the processes occurring prior  
to hydrolysis is six as represented in the reaction  
scheme.

Such a lengthy path is not to be lightly accepted,  
particularly as in some of the experiments each  
molecule of aldehyde added must account for as  
many as five molecules of final product and that the  
enolate ions, though of necessity in low relative  
concentration, must compete with alkoxide ions for  
the alkylating agent. Further, this course of the re­
action would account for a number of other by­
products that have not been found. Among these  
would be the monoalkylated alcohol, its benzyl  
ether, and the intermediate aldehydes. The final  
products certainly do not consist wholly of ether  
and dialkylated alcohol, but characterization of the  
other products has not been possible except that  
when 3-phen3dpropanol was used the dialkylated

aldehyde was isolated. These difficulties in isolating  
other by-products calls attention to the fortunate  
circumstances attending the original isolation of
2- benzyl-2,3-diphenylpropanol which, because of  
its ease of crystallization, was readily separated  
from other reaction products.
Before accepting the oxidation-alkylation-reduc­
tion path, efforts were made to ensure that the  
reaction did not proceed by some simpler though  
possibly more obscure manner. That the source of  
the benzyl groups was wholly from the benzyl  
chloride and not from the solvent, toluene, was  
proved in two ways. First, benzene instead of  
toluene was used, and although the yield was re­
duced to 9% the result left little doubt that the  
explanation invoked merely the lower reflux tem­
perature. Secondly, the benzyl chloride was re­
placed by allyl chloride whereupon a diallyl-  
phenethyl aldohol was obtained. With butyl bro­
mide no C-alkylation product could be isolated and  
it is probable that only quite rapidly acting alkyl­
ating agents would be successful.
The phenyl group in the alcohol is without doubt  
of value in the success of the reaction sequence  
through its stabilizing effect on the enolate ions  
as seen in Equations 2 and 4. It did seem important,  
however, to determine not only if it were necessary  
but also, in homologues of phenethyl alcohol, if  
it rather than the potential aldehyde group might  
govern the position of alkylation. To this end
3- phenvlpropanol and 4-phenylbutanol were sub­
jected to the benzylation reaction and both were  
found to be alkylated in the 2-position. The yields  
in the latter two reactions were so low as to make  
isolation of the products difficult. This again points  
to the efficacy of the phenyl group, when properly  
placed, in promoting the side reaction.

powdered sodium under 150 ml. of toluene there was added 
dropwise with stirring 30.5 g. (0.25 mole) of 2-phenylethanol. 
Toward the end of the addition it was necessary to bring 
the suspension to reflux in order to continue stirring. When 
the evolution of hydrogen had ceased, there was added dur­
ing 5 to 25 min. a solution of 31.5 g. (0.25 mole) of benzyl 
chloride containing 0.02 mole of benzaldehyde or other pro­
moter as listed in Table I. After approximately 1  hr. of re­
flux and stirring, the mixture was cooled; water was added 
and the organic layer was separated and distilled. Toluene 
and then benzyl 2-phenylethyl ether were distilled up to 
150° at 0.6 mm. The latter was not always isolated but gener­
ally occurred in about 40% yield. Treatment of the residue 
with petroleum ether (b p. 30-60°) gave the product, m.p.,

on the hot stage of a polarizing microscope and are corrected.The material, 3.5 g., could not be purified by crystallization 
and was chromatographed over alumina. Benzene elution 
produced crystals of m.p. 118-120°, recrystallized from 
methanol-water, m.p. 122-124°, which proved to be an alde­
hyde. Methanol-benzene elution then produced the alco­
hol, m.p. 80°. The high melting substance showed the in­
frared absorption of an aldehyde and it yielded a 2,4-dinitro- 
phenylhydrazone, crude m.p. 175-176°. The aldehyde, 0.4 g. 
was reduced by 0.1 g. of lithium aluminum hydride in ethyl

methanol-benzene), which was identical with that synthe­

Reduction of mesityl 2-methoxy-l-naphthyI ketone with the binary mixture, magnesium-magnesium iodide, gave 1,2- 
dihydro-l,l'-dimesitoyl-2,2'-binaphthyland l,l'-dimesitoyl-2,2'-binaphthyl. The dihydro diketone underwent cleavage with 
chloranil to give a monoketone, 1-mesitoy.-2, 2'-binaphthyl, and mesitoic acid. The monoketone, synthesized independently, 
was cyclized with polyphosphoric acid. Conversion of the dihydro diketone to the aromatic diketone was effected with 
palladium-on-charcoal.
It has been shown that hindered o-methoxy-  
phenyl ketones undergo reductive coupling and  
cyclization to yield the corresponding 9,10-di­
ary lphenanthrenes.3  The analogous behavior of  
mesityl 2-methoxy-l-naphthyl ketone (I) would  
afford a new entry into the picene family. A greater  
tendency for coupling might be expected in the  
naphthalene series as the methoxy ketone, be­
cause of the greater double bend quality of the 1,2-  
linkage, would be expected to behave more like  
an ester than does the benzene analog. Under re­
action conditions very similar to those employed  
previously, the naphthyl ketone gave coupling  
products in comparatively high yields. The trans­
formation stopped, however, at the diketone stage.  
The principal product II proved to be the dihydro  
derivative of the completely aromatized diketone

Of special interest was the transformation rea­
lized when the dihydroaromatic diketone II was  
treated with chloranil in anisole. The products  
were a monoketone, l-mesitoyl-2,2'-binaphthyl
(IV), and mesitoic acid. This result is unusual;  
the treatment with chloranil was expected to give  
the aromatized diketone. Aromatization was ac­
complished, however, by heating with palladium-  
on-charcoal.
IV v
The monoketone IV was synthesized independ­
ently by displacement of the methoxyl group of  
the methoxy ketone I by the action of the 2-naph­
thyl Grignard reagent. Ring closure of the mono­
ketone was effected with polyphosphoric acid, the  
product being the known 13H-dibenzo[a,i]fluoren-
13-one (V).
The aromatic diketone presumably was pro­
duced by dimerization of the ketyl formed by the  
interaction of the methoxy ketone and the binary  
mixture, magnesium-magnesium iodide.4  The di­
hydro diketone could conceivably be the intra­
molecular reduction product of the aromatic di-  
ketone, if ring closure were prevented by steric  
factors. Further reduction of the diketone pre-

sumably would give a dienol, which, after ketoni-  
zation, could then undergo an acid-catalyzed rear­
rangement to the dihydro product, the driving  
force being formation of the aromatic ring. The  
dihydro diketone is analogous to the keto alcohols  
VI, which have been isolated5  by the reduction of  
hindered o-methoxyphenyl ketones, except that  
an aromatic ring underwent reduction rather than  
a carbonyl group.
The cleavage of the dihydro diketone is some­
what similar to the pyrolysis of l,2-dihydro-2-  
phenyl-1-naphthyl triphenylmethyl ketone (VIII),  
which yields 2-phenylnaphthalene, triphenylmeth-  
ane, and carbon monoxide.6
The cleavage of the dihydrodiketone II is not a  
pyrolysis, however, as evidence has been accumu­
lated that chloranil is necessary; cleavage was not  
brought about by boiling in anisole without  
chloranil or by boiling with methoxide ion. An  
acid and not carbon monoxide is formed, so it  
seems that the two cleavage reactions are not re­
lated. According to the work of Braude, Jackman,  
and Linstead7  on the mechanism of the dehydro­
genation of dihydroaromatic hydrocarbons with  
quinoncs, the last step in the dehydrogenation of  
the dihydro diketone II would require the expulsion  
of a proton from the positively charged intermediate
VII. Perhaps the mesityl carbonium ion, rather  
than a proton, is lost; the formation of the mono­
ketone might be favored by steric factors.

Conversion of the higher melting to the lower melting form 
was accomplished by passing the solid, dissolved in benzene,

was negative. After the reddish-brown solution had cooled, 
it was extracted twice with 5%, sodium hydroxide, benzene 
and chloroform being added. The organic phase was washed 
with water and dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of solvent 
produced 0.59 g. of residue, which was chromatographed on 
a 25-g. alumina column. Elution with 5:1 cyclohexane: ether

synthesized independent^ was not depressed, and the 
infrared spectra of the two samples were superimposable.
When the combined sodium hydroxide extracts were 
acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid, a dark purple pre­
cipitate formed which dissolved readily in ether. The ether 
layer was washed repeatedly with water and dried over 
sodium sulfate. Solvent removal left a purple residue, which 
was then stirred with 5 ml. of coned, sulfuric acid. Ice and 
water were added, and the mixture was extracted with 
ether. The ether layer was washed with 5% sodium bicar­
bonate, the basic extract acidified, and the product taken

light yellow solution, which was boiled on a hot plate, 
ethanol being added to replace the chloroform removed by 
distillation. When the solution has cooled, 0.062 g. of the

Treatment of Ib-h with Grignard reagents leads to opening of the heterocyclic ring with the formation of IIa-1. IIa-1 
now have also been obtained by the action of the same reagent on the corresponding methyl o-aryldiazoaminobenzoates 
(Illa-g). Cleavage of the N—C bond of Ii and of Ij is effected by the action of phenylmagnesium bromide, and by the ac­
tion of lithium aluminum hydride in the case of Ij. Treatment of Ij with aluminum chloride, similarly, effects elimination of 
the acyl group, with the formation of la. The stability of the —N = N — system in la  toward the action of lithium aluminum 
hydride similates the behavior of methyl o-(p-tolyl)diazoaminobenzoate (IH b) toward the same reagent, whereby, n -(p -  
tolyl)diazoaminobenzyl alcohol is produced.
The reactions of 3-substituted 3,4-dihydro-4-  
keto-l,2,3-benzotriazines have not been thoroughly  
studied. In their reactions, they behave as masked  
diazonium compounds and undergo ring opening;  
a number of these reactions have been described.1  
The recent literature2 '3  covers only the preparation  
and spectra of some new members of this class of  
compounds, the chemical properties of which are  
now further explored.
In continuation of the work of one of us on the  
ring-opening of heterocyclic compounds by the  
action of organomagnesium compounds, e.g., in 
the case of benzoxazones,4  5  of 2,3-diphenylquin-  
azolone-4,4  of benzo-, and of naphtho^'^'-oxa-  
zole-2-one, as well as their iV-aroyl derivatives,6  
we now have investigated the behavior of 3-substi­
tuted 3,4-dihydro-4-keto-l,2,3-benzotriazines (Ib-  
h) toward the action of organomagnesium com­
pounds and the action of lithium aluminum hy­
dride. Thus, when 3-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-4-keto-
1,2,3-benzotriazine (lb) is treated with phenyl­
magnesium bromide, followed by hydrolysis, open­
ing of the heterocyclic ring is effected with the  
formation of o-phenyldiazoaminotriphenyl carbinol  
(Ha). Similar treatment of Ic-h with the same  
reagent results in the formation of o-substituted  
phenyldiazoaminotriphenyl carbinols (Ilb-g) re­
spectively (cf. Scheme A). Action of méthylmag­
nésium iodide on Ib-d, If, and Ig leads to the  
formation of o-substituted phenyldiazoaminodi-  
methylphenyl carbinols (IIh-1).

For further study of the effect of the acyl  
group attached to heterocyclic nitrogen com­
pounds with Grignard reagents, the action of  
phenylmagnesium bromide on 3-acetyl- (Ii) and  
on 3-benzoyl-3,4-dihydro-4-keto-l,2,3-benzotri-  
azines (Ij) now has been investigated. Ii and Ij  
undergo elimination of the acyl group by the action  
of the same reagent forming 3,4-dihydro-4-keto-
1,2,3-benzotriazine (la) together with diphenyl-  
methyl- and triphenylcarbinol, respectively. The  
elimination of the acyl group by the action of  
Grignard reagent is analogous to the behavior of  
A-benzoylphthalimide and of A-benzoylbenzo-  
triazole toward the action of phenylmagnesium  
bromide.6

Lithium aluminum hydride.  The action of lithium  
aluminum hydride on organic compounds6  has  
shown a far-reaching analogy with that of Grignard  
reagents. We have found that hydrogenolysis with  
the hydride, like treatment with phenylmagnesium  
bromide followed by hydrolysis, brings about  
cleavage of N—C bond of Ij with the isolation of  
benzyl alcohol. Hydrogenolysis, under the in­
fluence of the hydride, of the acyl group attached  
to a nitrogen compound has been reported in the  
reduction of ./V-acetylcarbazole,7  of acylated 2-  
benzoylaminothiazole,8  of 1-benzoylbenztriazole,9  
and of dibenzoyl-L-histidine.1 0
Treatment of Ij with anhydrous aluminum chlo­
ride at 120-125° effects elimination of the benzoyl  
group with the formation of la.
The stability of la toward the action of lithium  
aluminum hydride parallels its behavior toward  
phenylmagnesium bromide (see above). o-(p-Tolyl)-  
diazoaminotriphenyl carbinol (lib) has now been  
found to be stable toward the action of the same  
reagent under the given experimental conditions.1 1
The stability of the —N = N — system1 2  in  
lib  toward the action of lithium aluminum hy­
dride has also been observed when methyl o-  
(p-tolyl)diazoaminobenzoate (Illb) is subjected  
to similar treatment whereby o-(p-tolyl)diazo-  
aminobenzyl alcohol is produced, identified as the  
corresponding urethane.

To a Grignard solution prepared from 0.9 g. of magnesium 
and 9 g. of bromobenzene in 50 ml. of dry ether (in the case 
of phenylmagnesium bromide) was added a solution of 1 g. 
of lb or Ilia  in dry benzene (50 ml.). The mixture was heated 
for 3 hr. on a steam bath. After standing overnight at 25°, 
it was poured slowly into 100 ml. of saturated aqueous am­
monium chloride solution, extracted with ether, dried, and 
evaporated. The oil}' residue was washed several times with 
hot petroleum ether (b.p. 00-80°) and the resulting solid 
was crystallized from the proper solvent.
The products IIb-1 listed in Table I were prepared simi­
larly. In general they are soluble in hot benzene and chloro­
form, but are sparingly soluble in petroleum ether.

Reactions of the Grignard reagents from 4-mcthoxybenzyl clilor.de, 2-chIorobenzyl chloride, and /3-chloromethylnaph' 
thalene with cyanogen proceed with or/Ao-siibstitution, which yields, respectively, 2-methyl-5-methoxybenzonitrile, 2- 
methyI-3-chlorobenzonitrile, and 2-methyl-l-naphthonitrile. Reaction of benzjlmagnesium chloride with thiocyanogen 
proceeds with both direct and ori/io-sufcstitution which yields, respectively, benzyl mercaptan and o-tolyl thiocyanate. 
Possible mechanisms for the two thiocyanogen reactions are briefly discussed.
Recently it was found that benzylmagnesium  
chloride and cyanogen react to give o-tolunit.rile  
and that this new orfAo-substitutior. reaction occurs  
also with cyanogen and certain other benzyl-type  
Grignard reagents.1  Reported in this paper is a  
further study of the scope of this reaction. Addi­
tional benzyl-type Grignard reagents and benzyl-  
lithium have been treated with cyanogen, and  
benzylmagnesium chloride itself has been treated  
with cyanogen bromide and with thiocyanogen.
When cyanogen was treated with the Grignard  
reagents from 4-methoxybenzyl chloride (I), 2-  
chlorobenzyl chloride, and /3-chloromethylnaph-  
thalene, there were produced, respectively, 2-  
methyl-5-methoxybenzonitrile (II), 2-methyl-3-  
ehlorobenzonitrile, and 2-methyl-l-naphthonitrile.  
Each nitrile was hydrolyzed to the corresponding  
carboxylic acid for the purpose of identification.  
The reactions are illustrated (1) for 2-methoxy-  
benzyl chloride.
I II
The Grignard reagent in each of the above cases  
was prepared in the usual way and added to ethe­
real cyanogen. A more careful preparation of the  
Grignard reagents, to avoid coupling, would almost  
certainly improve the yield of nitrile, which was  
about 40% in this work. For example, from the  
reaction which gave 39% of nitrile from 4-methoxy­
benzyl chloride, there was also isolated a 42%  
yield of the coupled product, l,2-bis(4-methoxy-  
phenyl)ethane. When /3-bromomethylnaphthalene  
(instead of the corresponding chloromethyl com­
pound) was used, the yield of naphthonitrile was  
very low, probably as a consequence of the greater  
extent of coupling of the bromo compound.
Benzyllithium (III) was prepared from benzyl  
methyl ether and treated with cyanogen. In this

nitrile was poor, but this can be accounted for  
primarily as a consequence of the poor yield of  
lienzyllithium. In our hands the cleavage of benzyl  
methyl ether by lithium could not be accomplished  
nearly so well (see Experimental) as has been re­
ported.*  1 4 9  2
There are a number of compounds related to  
cyanogen, “pseudohalogens,” whose reactions with  
the benzyl-type Grignard reagent might be of in­
terest. The first two of these we have studied are  
thiocyanogen (NCSSCN) and cyanogen bromide  
(BrCN). The latter compound with benzylmagne­
sium chloride gives benzyl bromide in good yield.  
Cyanogen bromide is known to react with other  
Grignard reagents in a similar manner.3  4
Reactions between organometallics and the thio-  
cyano group have received very little attention,  
and the specific reaction of thiocyanogen with a  
Grignard reagent does not appear to have been  
studied at all. Reactions of thiocyanogen with  
certain other organometallics yield organothiocya-  
nates, e.g., IV in Equation 3.4  Reactions of organo-  
thiocyanates with Grignard reagents yield thiols  
and thioethers, e.g., Equation 4.6  For the latter  
reaction an attractive hypothesis for the intermedi­
ate yielding the thioether is structure V. Rearrange­
ment of this complex could proceed as indicated  
(Equation 5) for the five-membered quasi-ring.  
Such an intramolecular rearrangement (rather than  
bimolecular attack involving a second molecule of  
Grignard reagent) should be favored by addition  
of the organometallic to the thiocyanate, and it  
was found that the formation of thioether is en­
hanced by this inverse addition.5

S''RV (R = benzyl)anism is comparable to that substantiated for the  
reaction of cyanogen with benzyl-type Grignard  
reagents.1
After treatment of thiocyanogen with benzyl-  
magnesium chloride, hydrolysis yields two products  
of interest: benzyl mercaptan (VI, 30% yield) and  
o-tolyl thiocyanate (VII, 10% yield). The Grignard  
reagent was added to the thiocyanogen, which was  
freshly prepared by the action of bromine on lead  
thiocyanate. Each product was characterized by  
its physical properties and by conversion to known  
derivatives.

Formation of the major product, benzyl mer­
captan (VI), may be rationalized with the inter­
mediate VIII, whose rearrangement in the indi­
cated manner (Equation 7) would yield benzyl  
thiothiocyanate (IX). Subsequent hydrolysis would  
convert the thiothiocyanate to a thiol (Equation  
8).6  Hypothesis of the rearrangement of V is com­
parable to that of VIII, except that the quasi-ring  
involved in this latter example is six-membered;  
in the former it is five-membered.

Formation of o-tolyl thiocyanate (VII) from  
benzyl magnesium chloride and thiocyanogen is a  
new ort/io-substitution reaction, the first to involve  
reaction (rupture) of the sulfur-sulfur bond. Pos­
sibly the key intermediate for this reaction in­
volves complexing of the Grignard reagent with  
sulfur, as in X. Rearrangement (Equation 9) of  
such a complex through a six-membered quasi­
ring would produce an intermediate triene (XI),  
whose subsequent tautomerization would yield the  
isolable o-tolyl thiocyanate. This proposed mech-
(6) Such thiothiocyanates as IX have been previously 
reported and are known to be about as easily hydrolyzed as 
an acid chloride, c f. H. Lecher and M. Wittmer, H er.,  5 5 , 
1474 (1922).The suggestion that thiocyanogen reacts by two  
different paths, Equations 9 and 10, requires addi­
tional evidence, which is being sought. It would in  
fact be of interest to learn more about the reactions  
between thiocyanogen and Grignard reagents in  
general, and between other sulfur-containing com­
pounds and the benzyl-tvpe Grignard reagent  
specifically. Apparently not even the reaction be­
tween sulfur itself and benzylmagnesium chloride  
has been studied.
EXPERIMENTAL7
C y a n o g e n .  Cyanogen was prepared by treating a warm 
aqueous solution of copper sulfate with an aqueous solution 
of potassium cyanide. The gas liberated from the aqueous 
solution was passed through a calcium chloride drying 
tube and delivered into dry ether at 0° in a three-necked 
flask equipped with a stirrer and a Dry Ice reflux con­
denser. The cyanogen thus obtained, which was measured 
by the increase in weight of the ether solution, could be stored 
in the ether at 0° for several hours without appreciable 
loss.

slow addition (2 hr.) of 29.2 g. of p-chloromethylanisole 
in 100 ml. of ether to 24 g. of magnesium turnings in 400 
ml. of ether under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resultant 
solution was slowly added at 0° to 19.1 g. of cyanogen in 250 
ml. of ether. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 1 hr. 
and allowed to stand overnight before hydrolysis with 
aqueous ammonium chloride. The ether layer was separated, 
washed with water, and dried over magnesium sulfate, and 
the ether was distilled at reduced pressure. The residue was

formed. This mixture was refluxed for 30 min. and then was 
allowed to stand at room temperature overnight before it

layer was treated in the usual manner and the product was 
distilled at reduced pressure to yield a clear liquid, b.p. 128-

(in enough tetrahydrofuran to make up 100 ml. of solution) 
to 3.47 g. (0.5 mole) of powdered lithium metal in 400 ml. of 
tetrahydrofuran at — 5 to —15° under a nitrogen atmos­
phere .2 At the end of the addition and at 1-hr. intervals, 
20-ml. aliquots wore removed and shaken with 1.5 g. (0.008 
mole) of benzophenone. Each sample was then hydrolyzed 
with aqueous ammonium chloride and extracted with ether. 
Evaporation of the ether and recrystallization of any solid 
material from ligroin (b.p. 60-90°) yielded colorless 1,1,2—  
triphenylethanol, m.p. 87-88° (lit .,1 4  1 5 m.p. 89°). The yield 
of triphenylethanol from the aliquots increased slowly up 
to about 10 hr. after the benzyl methyl ether and lithium

The Grignard reagent prepared from 25.3 g. of benzyl

allowed to stand at 5° overnight before hydrolysis with 
aqueous ammonium chloride. The organic layer was sepa­

of o-tolylthiocyanate, b.p. 120-125°/15 mm. (lit ,1 8 b.p. 
122.5°/15 mm.). With alkaline lead tartrate, this fraction

2,4-Lutidine and 2,4,6-collidine reacted with phenyllithium to give lithium derivatives at the 2 position. These were identi­
fied by reaction with benzaldehyde to form the corresponding phenylcarbinols. Xo evidence of reaction at the 4 position 
could be detected.
Since its discovery by Ziegler and Zeiser 1 a- 
picolyllithium has become a very widely used rea­
gent. It is conveniently prepared by the hydrogen-  
metal exchange reaction of a-picoline with phenyl­
lithium at room temperature. Initial attempts to  
prepare •y-picolyllithium by a similar process  
were unsuccessful . 2 Gilman and Broadbent 3 added
7-picoline to a solution of n-butyllithinm and found  
that at — 80° no reaction took place. However,  
at — 10° they found that addition across the  
C=N bond occurred producing, after heating,  
2-n-butyl-4-methylpyridine. Erlenmeyer and co­
workers 4 found that when phenyllithium was  
treated with 7-picoline and subsequently carbo­
nated and hydrolyzed, the product was 2-phenyl-  
homoisonicotinic acid. This involved both addition  
across the C=N bond and metallation of the  
methyl group. Wibaut and Hey 5’6 reversed the  
procedure and added the phenyllithium solution  
to the 7-picoline on the assumption that if the  
metallation reaction is the more rapid of the two,  
the 7-picolyllithium should be formed in good yield.  
The 7-picolyllithium formed in this manner was  
treated with alkyl bromides and yields of up to  
G0% of the alkyl pyridine compounds were ob­
tained. The reactions were carried out at room  
temperature.
2,4-Lutidine has been treated with phenyl­
lithium .7' 8 The products obtained correspond to  
those expected if metallation occurs only on the  
a-methyl groups. The authors did not report any  
careful study to detect the formation of any of the
7- isomers.
Condensations with aldehydes also indicate that  
the a-methyl group is more reactive than that in  
the 7-position. Thus 2,4-lutidine condenses with

or zinc chloride1 0  to yield 2-styryl-4-methylpyridine  
as the only monostyryl derivative along with some
2.4- distyrylpyridine. 2,4,G-Collidine also reacts  
with aldehydes to give condensation at the 2-  
position. Dubke1 1  reported the preparation of 4,6-  
dimethyl-2-picol3T lphenylcarbinol and 4,6-dimethyl-  
2-stilbazole by condensation of benzaldehyde with  
collidine but he did not prove the structure of his  
products. Koenigs and Bentheim1 2  obtained 4,6-  
dimethyl-2-stilbazole by the same reaction and  
identified the product by oxidation to 4,6-dimethyl-  
picolinic acid. Several other condensations with  
aldehydes at the 2-position have also been re­
ported.13-16
This work was undertaken to determine the  
relative reactivities toward metallation on the 2-  
and 4- positions of 2,4-lutidine and of 2,4,6-collidine.  
This was done by treating the pyridine homologs  
with phenjdlithium. The resulting pyridinelithium  
compounds were identified by reaction with benz­
aldehyde and isolation of the resulting phenyl­
carbinols. In order for the ratio of the final yields  
of the isomers to be equivalent to the ratio of the  
lithium derivatives it must be assumed that the  
rate of addition of each isomer to the benzaldehyde  
is equal. This assumption seems reasonable since  
addition of organolithium compounds to benzalde­
hyde is a very rapid reaction.
DISCUSSION'
The phenyllithium solution was added to the
2.4- lutidine to minimize addition across the azo­
methylene linkage. I 11 the case of 2,4,G-collidine  
the normal addition of the base to the phenyl­
lithium was followed. After addition of the benz­
aldehyde, the phenylcarbinols were purified by  
crystallization of the hydrochloride-mercuric chlo-

ride double salts. The results are summarized in  
Table I.
The -i-methyl-2-picolylphenylcarbinol was iden­
tified by dehydration to 4-methyl-2-stilbazole.  
The structure of the stilbazole had been proved  
previously9  by oxidation to 4-methyl-2-picolinic  
acid and decarboxylation of this acid to 4-picoline.
The reaction product from the 2,4,6-collidine,  
after treatment with hydrochloric acid and mercuric  
chloride, was separated into three fractions. The  
major fraction yielded pure 4,6-dimethyl-2-picolyl-  
phenylcarbinol and amounted to 92.25% of the  
total product recovered. The second fraction was  
an oily mercuric chloride double salt which could  
not be crystallized. The base from this salt  
amounted to 5.25% of the total product. Its infrared  
spectrum was essentially the same as that of the  
main fraction except for an extra peak appearing  
between 8.2 and 8.4 ¡ x . Dehydration of this material  
produced 4,6-dimethyl-2-stilbazole, identified by  
mixed melting points of several derivatives. It  
was estimated that this fraction consisted of over  
50% 4,6-dimethyl-2-picolylphenylcarbinol. The  
third fraction of mercuric chloride double salt  
yielded only 2.5% of the total basic products  
and was not identified.
The major reaction product, 4,6-dimethyl-2-  
picolylphenylcarbinol, had been prepared by Dubke  
in 1894 along with the corresponding stilbazole  
but no attempt had been made to prove the struc­
ture. Koenigs and Bentheim1 2  prepared the stil­
bazole and proved its structure by oxidation to 4,6-  
dimethylpicolinic acid. The melting points of  
the derivatives of our carbinol agreed with those  
of Dubke but those of our stilbazole did not com­
pletely agree with either set of authors, ours being  
higher in all cases. Final proof of structure was  
made by oxidation of our compound to 4,6-di-  
methylpicolinic acid. This acid has been prepared1 7  
and its structure proved by decarboxylation to
2,4-lutidine.
These results show that metallation of 2,4-  
lutidine and 2,4,6-collidine occurs at the 2- position.  
No evidence could be obtained of metallation at  
the 4- position.

R e a c tio n  o f 2 ,4 -lu tid in e .  Phenyllit,hium was prepared from
135.6 g. (0.8 mole) of bromobenzene and 14 g. (2.02 g.-

tration of phenyllithium was found by titration with stand­
ard acid to be 0.98.17. This was subsequently checked by re­
action with benzaldehyde to form benzhydrol and a value of 
0.96.17 was obtained. Two hundred milliliters of this solution 
containing 0.196 mole of phenyllithium was added slowly to 
25 g. of 2,4-lutidine (0.6 mole, a 30% excess) in 200 ml. of 
obsolete ether under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The addi­
tion required 15 min. and the mixture was stirred an addi­
tional 15 min. An excess of benzaldehyde was then distilled 
directly into the reaction mixture. The product was decom­
posed and worked up in the usual manner. The basic con­
stituents were obtained as a , semisolid residue weighing 34.1 
g. 2,4-Lutidine (14.5 g.) was separated by steam distillation 
and recovered, leaving 18.6 g. of nonvolatile material.
The residue was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid and 
precipitated with an excess of hot aqueous mercuric chloride. 
The mercuric chloride double salt separated initially as an 
oil. The liquid was decanted from this oil and the rest of the 
double salt separated as white crystals. By repeated extrac­
tion of the oily material the product was finally separated 
into a white solid as the major fraction and 1.2 g. of a dark 
brown residue. The mercury was precipitated from the mer­
curic chloride double salts with hydrogen sulfide and the free 
bases were recovered. The major fraction weighed 17.9 g. 
and melted at 92.1-92.3° and was shown to be 4-methyl-2- 
picolylphenylcarbinol.

The amorphous material was not identified. ¡Since it 
amounted to only 1 % of the product, this represents the up­
per limit of condensation which could have occurred in the 
gamma position.
P r e p a r a tio n  o f 2 -s ty r y l-4 -m e th y lp y r id in e .  A sample of the
4-methyl-2-picolylphenylcarbinol was refluxed 1  hr. with 
acetic anhydride. The mixture was poured into dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution, the product was taken up in hexane and 
recrystallized several times from hexane: m.p., 71.8-72.3°; 
picrate, m.p., 259-260°. Mixed melting points with an au­
thentic sample prepared by the method of Clemo and Gour- 
lay9 gave no depression.
R e a c tio n  o f 2 ,4 ,6 -c o llid in e .  The procedure was essentially 
the same as that used for the 2,4-lutidine except that the col­
lidine was added to the phenyllithium since there was no 
likelihood of addition across the azomethylene linkage.
2,4,6-Collidine (25.8 g., 0.213 mole) in 100 ml. of absolute 
ether was added to 0.194 mole of phenyllithium in 200 ml. of 
ether. After decomposition of the reaction mixture with 
water and acid and after removal of the ether layer, the 
mixture was made alkaline and the basic constituents ex­
tracted with chloroform. Removal of the chloroform under 
vacuum in a rotary evaporator gave 37.7 g. of residue. This 
was dissolved in hydrochloric acid and treated with mercuric 
chloride. Working up the products as above gave 75 g. of a 
white crystalline product, 4.5 g. of a brown oil, and 2.8 g. of 
a brown amorphous solid, completely insoluble in water. 
The major fraction of the mercuric chloride double salt 
yielded 25.6 g. of 2-(4,6-dimethylpicolyl)phenylcarbinol. 
The brown oil, on precipitation of the mercury, gave 1.5 g, 
of an cil w rhich was shown to be largely the same material, 
and the other fraction gave 0.7 g. of an unidentified base.

product was purified by precipitation of the copper salt 
from aqueous solution and removal of the copper with hy­

Molecular orbital calculations indicate a resonance energy of 2.99 /S  for l,2-diaza-3,5,7-cyclooctatriene (I), and 4.76 /S  for 
the 5,6-benzo derivative (lie). Compounds of structure Ilia  and M b , which differ from derivatives of II only by the posi­
tions of double bonds, were synthesized. The failure of these derivatives of III to rearrange to the corresponding derivatives 
of II in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst w ras noted. The calculated resonance energy of I, although large, is inter­
preted as being consistent with a lack of aromatic character in a ring s}'stem such as I.
According to the simple molecular orbital  
theory,4 '5  if cyclooctatetraene were planar it would  
have a significantly lower resonance energy than  
benzene (1.66 j3  vs. 2.00 /3). In its simplest form the  
theory also predicts that a planar cyclooctatetraene  
would have a triplet ground state. Energy would  
be required to enlarge the interior natural angles of  
the tub form of cyclooctatetraene to force it into  
a planar configuration, and the resonance that  
could be gained is insufficient to bring this about.  
The molecule consequently exists in the tub form,6 '7  
and has very little resonance energy.
From the molecular orbital point of view, 1,2-  
diaza-3,5,7-cyclooctatriene (I) is essentially a  
cyclooctatetraene containing 10 electrons. It there­
fore satisfies Huckel’s rule (4n+2 7 r  electrons)8  and  
might be expected to be aromatic. It therefore

calculations might be made and compared with  
experiment.

b. Ar = 2,4-xylyl

The molecular orbital calculations were carried  
out for I with the usual assumptions4 -5:  (a) a  
planar system with exchange integrals all equal  
to P for adjacent atoms and zero otherwise, (b)

Coulomb integrals of a for carbon and a +  0.5 d  
for nitrogen, and (c) neglecting overlap. The energy  
levels are given in Table I. The total x energy was  
found to be 10.09 (3 , and the resonance energy (rela­
tive to a single Kekule form) is 2.90 /? .
For synthetic reasons, a study of the system II  
appeared to offer certain advantages. The calcula­
tions were therefore repeated for lie. The total x  
energy found for this compound was 16.76 ¡ 3 , 
and this yields a resonance energy of 4.76 ¡ 3 . 
Since a benzene ring has a calculated resonance  
energy of 2.0 /3 , the additional resonance of the  
system (2.76 ¡ 3 ) is a measure of the resonance of  
the heterocyclic ring, and differs little from the  
value calculated for the monocyclic compound.  
The energy levels are listed in Table I.

A value for ¡ 3 of about 20 kcal./mole is generally  
accepted,9  and would yield delocalization energies  
of 59.8 and 55.2 kcal./mole for the planar systems  
I and the heterocyclic ring of lie respectively.  
From the appropriate bending frequency of ethyl­
ene1 0  the energy required to distort the bond  
angles sufficiently to flatten out the tub can be  
calculated to be 31.5 kcal./mole. Clearly then,  
simple theory predicts planar systems will be more  
stable than the tub forms by 28.3 and 23.7 keal./  
mole respectively for both I and II. It is possible  
to improve the values of the exchange and overlap  
integrals without too much labor,4 ’5  but such  
improvements appear to have negligible effect on  
the total calculated energies and on the conclusions  
as to the presence or absence of aromaticity in  
other cases studied.1 1  Electron correlation and con­
figuration interaction are more difficult to treat,1 2

relatively high electron density. No attempt has  
been made to pursue the theoretical calculations  
beyond this point, however, for reasons given  
below.
Compound Ilia, an isomer of Ila, was first  
prepared as outlined on the flow sheet. The known
o-phenylenediacetic acid was converted via the  
acid chloride to diketone Vila. This compound  
was allowed to react with hydrazine under high  
dilution conditions,1 3  and gave Ilia in low yield.  
The structure of Ilia was established by analysis  
and molecular weight, and by the absence of any  
N—H stretching absorption in the infrared spec­
trum.
If the isomerization of an inline to a vinyl amine  
is endothermic by 3-6 kcal./mole, which are the  
values found for enolization of ketones,1 4  the planar  
structure lie  would appear to be at least 11.7 keal./  
mole more stable than the nonplanar IIIc, and it  
would appear that the reaction IIIc— »-lie should  
proceed. However, prolonged treatment of Ilia  
with palladium-on-charcoal in refluxing xylene  
brought about no isomerization. There appeared  
therefore to be a conflict between the predicted  
and observed results. For simplification, the effect  
of the aromatic substituents had been ignored in  
the calculations. Since these substituents were  
conjugated with the azme system, the possibility  
existed that this conjugation tended to stabilize  
the azine arrangement and to prevent the isomeri­
zation. It is well known that the two rings in bi­
phenyl can be forced from co-planarity by the  
presence of or(/io-groups, and therefore the syn­
thesis of Illb  tvas undertaken. This synthesis  
paralleled the earlier one, although the cyclization  
step had to be modified somewhat to obtain the  
desired product. It was found that Illb  was simi­
larly reluctant to isomerize to the desired form
(Hb).
It seems difficult to escape the conclusion that  
in this case the simple molecular orbital theory  
appears to fail to predict that which is experi­
mentally found. Other apparent failures of the  
theorjr  in predicting aromaticity have been re­
ported in the past.1 5  It may be noted, however,  
that although the predicted resonance energy of  
I (2.99 /3 ) appears large relative to that of benzene  
(2.00 d), when other effects are taken into account,  
the predicted isomerization energy for IIIc— »-lie  
amounts to only 12 kcal./mole, so that a lack of  
aromaticit}7 '  in II cannot be considered alarming.  
Since the simple form of the molecular orbital  
theory appears to suffer from some basic difficulties

diacetonitrile,1 ?  70 g., and 700 ml. of 0>N hydrochloric acid 
was refluxed until a homogeneous solution was obtained. 
Five hundred milliliters of the solution was then distilled, 
and the remaining solution was cooled. The solid which 
separated was filtered and recrystallized from water to give 
81 g. (93%) of product in the form of colorless needles, m.p.
149-150° (lit.,1 8  m.p. 149-150°).

were converted to the corresponding acid chloride by heating 
at 70° with 15.3 g. of thionyl chloride for 6 hr. The excess 
thionyl chloride was then removed under reduced pressure 
and the acid chloride was dissolved in 30 ml. of benzene. 
The resulting solution was added over 30 min. to a stirred 
mixture of 16 g. of anhydrous aluminum chloride in 80 ml. 
of benzene. Stirring was continued for 2 hr. and the mixture 
was then poured onto a mixture of ice and hydrochloric acid. 
The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with ben­
zene. The combined benzene layers were washed with dilute 
sodium carbonate solution, and then with water. The ben­
zene solution was then concentrated to a volume of 100 ml., 
and deposited colorless crystals upon cooling. Two recrys­
tallizations from benzene gave the diketone as needles, 
wt. 11.9 g. (74%), m.p. 181.5-182°.

by Overberger and Lapkin1 3  for a similar cyclization. A 
warm solution of 6.28 g. of the diketone (V) in 110 ml. of 
dimethylformamide was mixed with a warm solution of 2.26 
g. of hydrazine hydrobromide in 70 ml. of dimethylforma­
mide. The resulting solution was allowed to stand for 2 days, 
and then was diluted with 400 ml. of absolute ethanol and 
added to 1500 ml. of absolute ethanol containing 60 ml. of 
pyridine under high dilution conditions over a period of 24 
hr. The resulting mixture was then heated under reflux for 
3 days, and concentrated under vacuum to a volume of 300 
ml. This solution was poured into ice water. The yellow solid 
which separated was collected, wt. 6 g. A portion of this 
material was recrystallized twice from aqueous acetone and 
furnished large pale yellow needles, m.p. 157.5-158.5°, and a 
small amount of small golden plates, m.p. 244-244.5°, which

A series of 2-(o-halophenyl)quinolines (X = F, Cl, or Br) was prepared for the purpose of a preliminary investigation of 
hindered rotation. o-Haloacetophonones and -propiophenones were subjected to the Pfitzinger reaction to give^ 2-(o-halo- 
phenyl)cinchoninic acids and the corresponding 3-methyl compounds. Using o-halophenacyl acetates in the Pfitzinger reac­
tion, 2-(o-halophenyl)-3-hydroxycinchoninic acids were obtained. The cinchoninic acids were decarboxylated to the corre­
sponding 2-(o-halophenyl)quinolines which were, in turn, converted to the methiodides. An attem pt was made at resolution 
by conversion of some of the methiodides to diastereoisomeric camphor sulfonates but no separation could be demonstrated. 
A comparison of the ultraviolet spectra of the methiodides of the 2-(o-halophenyl)quinolines and the corresponding ones with 
a methyl group in the 3-position did not show any differences which could be used to indicate hindered rotation.
Hindered rotation in the properly substituted  
biaryls and in a variety of other molecules has  
been a well established fact for a long time. The

tion of compounds such as 2V-methyl-2-(2'-carbo-  
methoxyphenyl)-3-carbomethoxypyridinium iodide  
and _V,N'-dimethyl-3,3'-dicarbomethoxy-2,2'-bipy-  
ridinium diiodide.1 6  There has been some investi­
gation in the biquinolines. Bell and Morgan1 6  
tried the resolution of 8,8'-biquinoline and Craw­
ford and Smyth1 7  actually resolved 4,4'- and 5,5'-  
biquinoline. The hindrance to coplanarity in these  
examples with attributed to factors other than the  
size of the atoms. Similar resolutions have also been  
done in the biisoquinoline series.1 8
It was the purpose of this research to synthesize  
some arylquinolines having bulky groups in ortho  
positions and do a preliminary study of the resolu­
tion of some of these. The 2-arylquinolines were  
chosen because synthesis appeared to be simpler  
through either a Conrad-Limpach reaction or the  
Pfitzinger reaction or even by alkylation in the  
alpha  position by a lithium aryl. After some pre­
liminary work the Pfitzinger reaction seemed to  
offer the best method. The prerequisite o-haloaceto-  
and o-halopropiophenones were prepared essenti­
ally according to the procedure of Lutz.1 9  The phen-  
acyl acetates were obtained by the action of potas­
sium acetate upon the phenacyl halides. The methyl  
phenacyl ethers were not used as the preparation  
of these was not highly successful. The Pfitzinger  
reaction proceeded smoothly with the phenacyl  
acetates and decarboxylation2 0  of the cinchoninic

acids offered no difficulty. However, the Pfitzinger 
reaction was unsuccessful with o-nitropropiophen- 
one. The 3 - methoxy -2 - (o-  halophenyl)quinolines 
were more conveniently prepared by methylation 
of the corresponding 3-hydroxy compounds. Ex­
cept for the latter compounds, the methiodides 
were prepared by treatment of the quinoline com­
pound with methyl sulfate and precipitin ion of the 
iodide by treatment of the aqueous methosulfate 
solution with potassium iodide.
On the basis of the accepted values for bond dis­
tances2 1  used in the biphenyls, the lV,3-dimethyl- 
2-(2'-chlorophenyl)quinolinium d-camphorsulfonate 
and the corresponding 3'-bromo- compound should 
have been resolvable. The overlap or hindrance 
value should be 0.22 A for the 2'-chloro and 0.35 
A for the 2'-bromo compound. However, if inter­
atomic distances are shorter as claimed by Hille- 
mann,2 2  or if one used the more generally accepted 
values, then the 2'-chloro compound would give 
no overlap while the 2'-bromo compound would
ogive a 0.12 A interference.
From the work on the hindered phenylfurans,8  
these substances seem to follow the biphenyls 
closely, but the ease of racemization and/or the 
isolation of only one optically active form of a pair 
in the case of the hindered thiophenes,9  the pyr­
roles,7  and phenylpyridines1 5  would indicate that 
the interatomic distances must be different or the 
electron-releasing effect may allow coplanarity of 
the aryl rings.
It has been reported by Pickett, Walter, and 
France,2 3  Rodebush,2 4 ’ 2 5  and others that biphenyls 
exhibiting hindrance due to bulky groups in the 
ortho  positions have ultraviolet spectra like that 
of the simple substituted benzene, while biphenyls 
in which free rotation occurs have different ultra­
violet spectra. 2,2',4,4'-6,6'-Hexamethylbiphenyl 
has an ultraviolet spectra like that of mesitylene 
while 4,4'-dimethylbiphenyl has a spectrum dif­
ferent from that of toluene. This is explained on the 
basis that in the latter biphenyl, the aromatic rings 
can become coplanar to allow reasonance between 
them while in the hindered biphenyl, the rings 
cannot become coplanar; therefore, the spectra 
are not altered because of resonance between the 
rings. Examples of this in the heterocyclic series 
have been reported. It has been shown that the 
ultraviolet spectra of 4,4'- and 5,5'-biquinoline1 7  
is like that of quinoline. Jean and Nord2 6  found 
that the spectrum of 3-(2-methyl-G-nitrophenyl)-

(1955).2,5-dimethylthiophene-4-carboxylic acid was similar  
to that of a composite of m-nitrotoluene and 2,5-  
dimethyl-3-thenoic acid while that of 3,3',5,5'-  
tetranitro-2,2'-bithienyl was not like that of 3,5-  
dinitrothiophene.
With the above in mind, the ultraviolet spectra  
of a series of arylquinolines were studied. The  
spectra of the methiodides of 2-(2'-halophenyl)-  
quinolines, which should show no hindrance, were  
the same as for the methiodides of 3-methyl-2-  
(2'-halophenyl)quinolines. On the basis of this  
observation, even iV,3-dimethyl-2-(2'-bromo-  
phenyl)quinolinium iodide did not show hindrance.

o-Fluorophenacyl bromide, o-chlorophenacyl bromide, and  
o-bromophenacyl bromide  were prepared by the customary 
method 1 9 of bromination of the corresponding acetophenone. 
The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives of these are 
summarized in Table I. The phcnacyl bromides  were con­
verted to the acetates  by the conventional procedure. These 
are summarized in Table II and the 2,4-dinitrophenyl- 
hydrazones in Table I.

Dehydrobromination of 9-a-bromoethylacridine gives 9-vinyIacridinc (III). The structure is confirmed by reduction of 
9-ethylacridane. 9-a-Bromoethvlacridinc and 9-/3-bromoethylacridine as well as III react with piperidine to give 9-/S-piperi-
dinoethylacridine.
Some time ago we reported1  the preparation of 
acridine amino alcohols of type I. We also wished 
to prepare II and Ha, but the effort failed because 
we were unable to prepare the 9-metalated acridine 
derivatives necessary to react with the appropriate 
amino aldehydes.2  The reverse procedure (in which 
an amino organometallic compound reacts with 
acridine-9-aldehyde [V]) cannot be applied here 
as one- and two- carbon amino organometallic 
compounds cannot be prepared.3
There are other approaches to this synthetic 
problem, however, and it is the purpose of this 
paper to present a partial investigation of one of 
them, namely, the route employing 9-vinylacridine
(III). The results presented here are incomplete.

(3) Wittig and Wetterling (Annalen , 5 5 7 , 193-201
(1947)) report that ylides such as (CII 3)3N + -CH2: behave 
like organometallic compounds and add to carbonyl com­
pounds. We have not investigated the application of ylides
to this problem. The writer has also been informed (personal
communication from Dr. E. M. Fry of this laboratory) that, 
diethylaminomethyl methyl ether reacts with lithium metal
to yield 1,2-bisdiethylaminoethane. This is a coupling prod­
uct. of the expected diothvlaminomefhyllithium, reminiscent 
of that encountered in the reaction of lithium with benzyl 
halides. Thus the dialkylaminomethyl lithium compound 
probably may have a transitory existence and might be
trapped.We have, however, discontinued this work some 
time ago, and, as there is no likelihood of its being 
resumed, we would like to present the results at this 
time.
In 1936, 0. Eisleb reported4  *  a number of acridine 
derivatives which might lead to the preparation of 
II. Acridine-9-carboxyaldehyde (Y) was condensed 
with nitromethane to yield XIV. The latter could 
not be reduced to the desired amino alcohol. 
He also prepared 9-acetylacridine (XV), which 
was subsequently converted to both XVI and XVII. 
He was unable to convert either of these to the 
desired amino alcohol.
In 1940, Braz and Gortinskaya6  *  *  reported the 
conversion of acridine-9-carboxylic acid to XVI 
via the diazo ketone. XVI was mentioned as an 
intermediate for the synthesis of possible anti- 
malarial pharmaceuticals, but as none of its re­
actions were described, it is reasonable to assume 
that these workers encountered the same dif­
ficulty as did Eisleb. As Eisleb did not characterize 
XVI, it is not possible to compare his substance 
with that of the Russian scientists.
Subsequently, Braz and Ivore6  studied the re­
action of XVI with piperidine and with dicthyl-

amine. No amino ketone was isolated, but they were 
able to recover acridone and XV, along with a large 
amount of amine hydrobromide. Speculations upon 
possible mechanisms for these reactions leads one 
to the conclusion that the presence of the 9-a- 
keto group is perhaps the feature of XVI, which is 
responsible for these untoward results. Unfortu­
nately, the facile reduction of acridine itself dis­
courages one from attempting to transform XVI 
into the corresponding carbinol, as has been done7  
with other a-halo ketones.
One very attractive synthesis of amino alcohols 
consists of the addition of secondary amines to 
epoxides. As the latter compounds may be pre­
pared by the epoxidation of vinyl compounds, we 
decided to investigate the preparation and reactions 
of 9-vinylacridine (III). Perhaps the most logical 
approaches to III involve the dehydration of 9- 
a- (and /J)-ethanols (VI and VII), and dehydrohalo- 
genation of the derived 9-a- and /3-haloethylacri- 
dines (VIII and IX). The first and third of these 
materials appeared to be the most attractive. All 
four were prepared by the methods described by 
Eisleb.
When VIII was treated rather gently with f-bu- 
tanolic potassium hydroxide, we obtained pale 
yellow parallelograms of 9-vinylacridine (III) 
which melted at 85-87°. Hydrogenation of III 
yielded a tetrahydroderivative identical with the
9-ethylacridane (XVIII) obtained by an entirely 
unrelated sequence of reactions. Moreover, an 
addition reaction with piperidine, which will be 
discussed later in this paper, lends strong confirma­
tory evidence for the proposed structure. A qui- 
nuclidine-like rather than a vinyl configuration 
seems unlikely.

elements of hydrogen chloride when treated with 
hypochlorous and hydrochloric acid. As would be 
expected of a compound of this structure, III be­
haves as an active vinyl monomer, and polymerizes 
readily with the production of resinous material, 
either on standing or when the free base is regener­
ated from its salts. An acetone solution of the 
perchlorate similarly undergoes polymerization. 
While considerable purification may be effected 
by sublimation and crystallization from petroleum 
ether, it is difficult to obtain III in a state of analyti­
cal purity. However, a sample of the base which 
had been treated with ¿-butyl hypochlorite followed 
by dibutylamine (in an abortive attempt to prepare 
the chlorhydrin and the amino alcohol), yielded 
III analytically pure, melting at 82-85°. Of the 
salts, the perchlorate is a suitable derivative, 
melting at 221-222° dec., while with picric acid 
one obtains (presumably) the picrate, which de­
composes at 188°.
Of the remaining three methods proposed above 
for the synthesis of III, the dehydration of VII was 
not investigated at all, and the dehydrohalogena- 
tion of IX (x = chlorine) only in one experiment. 
The dehydration of VI led to a material of unde­
termined composition which showed a different 
melting point from that of III, although its analyses 
and salts suggest a similar or identical compo­
sition.
As alluded to above, 9-vinylacridine with piperi­
dine yielded an adduct which subsequently proved 
to be XII, identical with the Mannich product ob­
tained by Monti8  from 9-methylacridine (IV), 
formaldehyde and piperidine hydrochloride. XII 
was also obtained by treatment of either  VIII or 
IX 3  with piperidine. The reaction no doubt proceeds 
via III as an intermediate. Eisleb prepared a 
product which he formulated as XI by treating 
methylethanolamine with VIII. In the light of the 
present work, the true formulation of this product 
probably corresponds to XIII.
EXPERIMENTAL9
9-Methylacridine  (IV) and aeridinc-9-aldehyde  (V) were 
prepared as described previously .1
9-a-Hydroxyethylacrzdine  (VI) was prepared by the 
action of methyllithium on V; m.p. 178-180°. Eisleb 4  
reports m.p. 178-180° for this compound.
9-0-Hydroxyethylaeridine  (VII) was obtained by the action 
of formaldehyde on IV  according to Eisleb .4 When crystal­
lized from benzene, it crystallized as white warts at tem­
peratures above 40° and as yellow needles below this tem­
perature. Both forms melt at 154° and are interconvertible. 
Eisleb gives the m.p. 154°.
9-a- (and 0-) Bromoethylacridines  (VIII and IX) were 
prepared by the method of Eisleb .4 As might be expected, 
these compounds could not be obtained in a state of analyti­
cal purity. The /S-bromoethylacridine hydrobromide ap­

for 0.5 hr. on the steam bath with 25 ml. of a saturated solu­
tion of potassium hydroxide in ¿-butyl alcohol, and parti­
tioning the cooled reaction mixture between water and 
ether gave III in the ether layer. The product was purified 
by sublimation and crystallization from petroleum ether 
(b.p. 30-60°), m.p. 85-87°, yield, 0.5 g. This material was 
not directly analyzed. However, material which was re­

The III perchlorate, quite insoluble in water or alcohol, 
may be crystallized from acetone by adding petroleum 
ether (b.p. 30-60°), m.p. 221-222° (rapid heating, darkens 
at 215°).

Acetone solutions of this salt decompose on standing with 
the deposition of polymer but the base may be obtained quite 
pure by liberation from fresh solutions of the perchlorate.
Treatment of III with twice the theoretical amount of 
1M bromine in acetic acid, followed by passing in hydrogen 
chloride, results in the immediate formation of a yellow 
crystalline precipitate of 9-a,0-dibromoethylacridine (X), 
m.p. 187-189°, (gassing, heated rapidty) which may be 
recrystallized from 75% acetone: 25% water, or from hydro­

I ll promptly decolorizes solutions of potassium per­
manganate and bromine. It appears to resist ozonization, 
as a large amount of starting material may be recovered 
and aldehyde tests on the reaction mixture are negative. 
With picric acid, a substance  is obtained which decomposes 
at 188-190° without melting. Ill appears to polymerize 
slowly when it is allowed to stand. A sample, m.p. 82-83°, 
after standing 4.5 days exposed to air melted at 83-86° 
with sintering at 81°. Treatment of III with water in the 
presence of ¿-butyl alcohol and base yields a material, m.p. 
153-162°, which gives a strong melting point depression 
when mixed with VII.
After treatment of 1  mmole of III with 15 ml. of 0.14V 
monoperphthalic acid in ether, and the addition of 30 ml. of 
chloroform, the mixture was allowed to stand for 2 days; 
it yielded reddish brown crystals (from ether), m.p. 173- 
174°.

Treatment of the III from 1.0 g. of VIII hydrobromide 
with 5.0 ml. of 0.543V hypochlorous acid plus 2.0 ml. of 
hydrochloric acid for 45 min., yielded a complex mixture 
from which we isolated a base which was extracted 
from water by ether, m.p. 125° (from ether). This is perhaps 
a chloroethylacridine.

5.00. Found: C, 74.64; H, 4.68.
Dehydration of  VI was effected by heating with “natur- 
cupfer C” copper bronze in a sublimation apparatus until 
an oil refluxed, then applying vacuum to sublime the 
product, which was purified as the sulfate,  which darkens 
but does not melt by 270° (from ethanol or ethanol-ether).

4.32. Found: C, 59.64; H, 4.37.
The base was obtained from the sulfate along with a cer­
tain amount of polymer, and was purified by sublimationand crystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°); m.p.
108.2-109.4°. It was perhaps not analytically pure .1 0

Found: C, 87.34, 87.21; H, 5.37, 5.11.
The material turns brown on standing. Treatment of the 
base with picric acid yields a substance which may be a 
picrate hemihydrate,  m.p. 185-187° (from aqueous ethanol).
Anal.  Calcd. for Q 1H1 4N4O7 +  0.5H2 (), m.w. 443.36: 
C, 56.89; H, 3.41. Found: C, 57.06; H, 3.51.
This base (from VI) is unsaturated to potassium per­
manganate. Attempted ozonization yielded a black tar 
which got hot on exposure to air. Considerable starting mate­
rial, m.p. 108.3-109.1 was recovered, and aldehyde tests 
were negative. Attempted oxidation with chromic anhy­
dride in glacial acetic acid led only to an extremely insoluble 
chromate salt, from which starting material could be 
recovered, m.p. 108°.
Preparation of 9-eihylacridane  (XVIII). (a) By hydrogena­
tion of  III. A hydrogenation reaction of 1.0 g. of III (m.p.
87.5-88.5°) in 25 ml. of ethanol with 115 mg. of platinum 
oxide catalyst absorbed 275 ml. of hydrogen in 50 min. 
This is approximately the theoretical amount for two double 
bonds. The product, XVIII, was crystallized from petroleum 
ether (b.p. 30-60°) as beautiful white prisms, m.p. 112°.

(6) From diphenylamine and propionic anhydride.  Reflux­
ing 50 g. of diphenylamine, 36 g. of propionic anhydride, 
and 35 g. of fused zinc chloride for 4 hr. led to 9-ethyl- 
acridine, m.p. 106-109°. Hydrogenation of the latter with 
platinum oxide catalyst in ethanol produced XVIII, m.p. 
110-111.5°, undepressed upon admixture of material from 
(a).
Hydrogenation of VII (0.4 g.) with 40 mg. of platinum 
oxide catalyst in ethanol solution yielded a mixture of yellow 
prisms, m.p. 160-164°, and white prisms, m.p. 132.5-134°. 
The latter had the correct analysis for 9-fi-hydroxyethyl-  
acridane.
Anal.  Calcd. for C 1 5H1 5ON, m.w. 225.28: C, 79.97; H, 
6.71. Found: C, 79.80; H, 6.81.
9-&-Chloroethylaeridine,  m.p. 112° was obtained when 1.4 
g. of VII was let stand with a mixture of 0.5 ml. of thionyl 
chloride and 20 ml. of chloroform, then refluxed 1 hr., and 
the base liberated. As the base is heated, it fuses, then 
resolidifies to a yellow solid which melts at 228°.
Anal.  Calcd. for CuH^NCl, m.w. 241.72: C, 74.55; H, 
5.00. Found: C, 75.22; H, 5.05.
The base decomposed on standing. Treatment of the 
base with ¿-butanolic potassium hydroxide, according to the 
directions given for the preparation of III, yielded a sub­
stance, m.p. 75-80°, which is probably crude III.
9-0-Piperidinoethylacridine  (XII). (a) By addition of  
piperidine to  III. Freshly prepared III was heated over­
night on the steam bath with excess piperidine. The excess 
piperidine was removed, leaving a brown oil which crystal­
lized very readily upon adding acetone to pale yellow crys­
tals, m.p. 134-136°. Repeated crystallization from acetone 
raised the m.p. to 137-138°.

Found: C, 82.37, 82.36; H, 7.66, 7.66.
(6) From  IV, formaldehyde and piperidine.  Piperidine- 
methylol was prepared from 9.9 ml. of piperidine and 8.4 
ml. of 36% formaldehyde, and diluted to a volume of 30 ml. 
with methanol. Three milliliters of this solution (0.01 mole) 
was added drop wise to a refluxing solution of 1.9 g. of IV 
in methanol. After a further 15 min. of refluxing the mixture 
was concentrated to dryness, washed with water, and the 
yellow XI crystallized from acetone, m.p. 135-136°. Monti 8  
did not report the melting point of this material, but Eisleb 4  
gives the value 137.5°. The hydrochloride melted at 171- 
173°. Monti reported the value as 169°.

Substitution in dixanthylene (Ie) in position 1  and 1', which hinders the planarity of the whole molecule, is detrimental 
to the development of thermochromic properties (Table 1). Fission of the central ethylene linkage in dixanthylenes is brought 
about by the action of thionyl chloride followed by water to give the xanthone derivatives (Va-d) and by the action of sulfur 
at 270° to yield the corresponding xanthione derivatives (VI, Table III). The new xanthone derivative Ye, needed in 
this investigation has been synthesized. 1-Chloroxanthone (Va) condenses with aromatic thiols in the presence of potassium 
hydroxide to yield the corresponding arylmercapto derivatives (VIII, Table IV) which are oxidized readily to the corre­
sponding sulfone derivatives (IX, Table IV). Photochemical dehydrogenation of 2-methylxanthene is effected by the action 
of Vb and/or Vg-h. 9-Phenyl-4-chloroxanthene (Xb) undergoes photochemical oxidation in sunlight in the presence of 
oxygen, yielding 4-chloro-9-phenylxanthyl peroxide (Xlb). Reduction of substituted xanthones with lithium aluminum hy­
dride and with metallic sodium and alcohol led to the formation of the reduction products, listed in Table V.
In continuation of the study of the constitutional 
changes in thermochromic substances,1  we now 
have extended our previous investigations'(a ) to 
show how substitution affects the thermochromic 
properties of dixanthylene (Ie) a strongly thermo­
chromic substance. The crystals are colorless at 
liquid air temperature, turn blue-greenish on heat­
ing and the melt is deep blue-green. The results are

DISCUSSION
Recently, Schônberg, Mustafa, and Asker1 (d ) 
advanced a hypothesis that “in overcrowded mole­
cules in which planarity is hindered, the degree 
of non-planarity changes with temperature. This 
is associated with the change of color, one reason 
being that resonance is related to planarity.” 
Dixanthylenes, e.g., Ie, a thermochromic com­
pound, lose this property upon substitution at 
position 1  and V ( c f . Table I). The loss of the ther­
mochromic properties is due to a constitutional 
change in I, overcrowding of the molecule to such 
a degree that planarity is hindered even at high
1520 MUSTAFA, A SK ER, AND SOBHY VOL. 2 5
temperatures.2  In accordance with this con­
ception is the lack of thermochrcmic properties 
of Ib-d and the weakly thermochromic properties 
of la and II since their molecules are much less 
overcrowded. From this, it has been concluded 
that the green forms of Ie and its analogs, “the 
colored molecules” have a greater degree of plan­
arity; the experiments of thermochromic bian- 
thrones have led Hirshberg, Loewenthal, Bergmann, 
and Pullman3  to a similar conclusion.
Action of thionyl chloride on dixanthylenes.  
Dixanthylene shows remarkable behavior toward 
thionyl chloride, followed by the action of water.1 ( c >  
Fission of the central ethylene bond, which has 
single bond character ( c f. IVa and IVb), occurs and 
xanthone is formed. We have now found that, 
analogously, ‘he substituted xanthones (Va-d) 
are obtained by the action of thionyl chloride on 
the corresponding dixanthylenes followed by treat­
ment with water.

cal action of sulfur-containing compounds against 
Bilhcrziasis ,5 the action of thiolate anion on Va now

heated with the appropriate thiol in the presence of 
solid potassium hydroxide, the corresponding aryl-

which are readily oxidized to the corresponding

photochemical dehydrogenation reaction,8  yield­
ing 2,2'-dimethyl-9,9'-bixanthene when its ben­
zene solution is allowed to react with 2-methyl 
xanthene in sunlight and in the absence of oxygen. 
A similar photochemical dehydrogenation reaction 
has also been observed, yielding 2,2'-dimethyl- 
9,9'-bixanthene, when Vd, Vg, and/or Vh was used 
instead of Vb in the above reaction. The fate of 
the ketone has not yet been established.
9-Arylxanthenes, e.g., 9-phenylxanthene (Xa), 
when their benzene solutions are exposed to sun­
light in presence of air, form 9-arylxanthvl per­
oxides, e.g., 9-phenylxanthyl peroxide (XIa).o (b ) 
We now have found that Xb behaves, similarly, 
under the action of sunlight in the presence of 
oxygen, yielding 4-chloro-9-phenyr lxanthyl per­
oxide (Xlb). Xb now has been obtained by the 
reduction of 4-chloro-9-phenylxanthhydrol with 
zinc and glacial acetic acid. The photoperoxide

formation of XI under the influence of sunlight 
possibly may be attributed to a direct attack by 
oxygen on an excited form of X. That Xlb is a 
peroxide is established by the fact that it liberates 
iodine from potassium iodide solution in acetic 
acid; Xlb gives 4-chloroxanthonc on pyrolysis.
Reactions with lithium aluminum hydride.  It 
been found that when certain aromatic ketones 
containing amino or methoxyl groups ortho  or 
para to the carbonyl group are reduced under 
forcing conditions with excess lithium aluminum 
hydride at elevated temperature for long periods, 
reduction and hydrogenolysis occur to a methyl 
or methylene group.9  Recently, similar behavior has 
been reported in the xanthone series. Thus, reduc­
tion of xanthone, 1,2-benzo-, and 3,4-betizox- 
anthones1 0  and 10-thioxanthone with lithium alumi­
num hydride proceeds one step further to give the 
corresponding xanthenes.1 1  Halogen substituted

undergo reduction with the same reagent leading 
to the formation of xanthene in every case with the 
loss of halogen.5 (b ) The reduction of hvdroxyxan- 
thones, e.g., 1-hydroxy- and l-hydroxy-3-methyl- 
xanthone with the same reagent gives the cor­
responding xanthene derivatives, namely, 1-hy­
droxy- and l-hydroxy-3-methylxanthene.9  In none 
of the examples cited does fractional crystallization 
of the reaction products reveal the presence of the 
corresponding hydrols.1 2  The reaction was carried 
out in all cases in boiling ether-benzene solution.
We now have investigated the reduction of a 
number of mono- and disubstituted xanthones 
with lithium aluminum hydride. Thus, when 
Vd-g are allowed to react with the same reagent 
in boiling ether-benzene solution for three hours 
and kept at room temperature overnight, followed 
by hydrolysis, the corresponding xanthhydrol 
derivatives, namely, 4-methyl-, 1,4-dimethyl-, 1,3- 
dimethyl- and 2,4-dimethylxanthhydrols (cf. Table
V), are obtained, respectively, in an almost quan­
titative yield. Fractional crystallization of the re­
action products does not reveal the presence of the 
corresponding xanthones. On the other hand, when 
Vb-c are treated with the same reagent under the 
same conditions, the corresponding xanthene deriv­
atives, namely, 2-methyl- and 2-phenylxanthenes 
(cf. Table V) are obtained, respectively, in ar, 
almost quantitative yield.
The reduction of Vh with lithium aluminum 
hydr.de under the same conditions, led to the for­
mation of a colorless product which upon fractional 
crystallization gave 2,3-dimethylxanthhydrol and
2.3- dimethylxanthene. We tvould like to report 
that, whereas, the 1- or 4-monosubstituted or the
1.4- disubstituted xanthones give the corresponding 
xanthhydrol derivatives on reduction with lith­
ium aluminum hydride, the 2-substituted xan­
thones give the corresponding xanthene derivatives 
with the same reagent. AT, on reduction with 
lithium aluminum hydride, gives a mixture of the 
corresponding xanthhydrol and xanthene deriva­
tives. The study of the effet of substituent group1 3  
on the reduction of the xanthone derivatives with 
lithium aluminum hydride, under different ex­
perimental conditions, is under further investiga­
tion.

EXPERIMENTAL
D ix a n th y le n e  d eriva tiv es  (I). M e th o d  (a). Two g. of the 
xanthone were refluxed (using a calcium chloride tube) with 
15 ml. of thionyl chloride (or with 10 g. of oxalyl chloride) 
for 10 hr.; the excess thionyl chloride (or oxalyl chloride) 
was distilled, and the residual oil dissolved in 30 ml. of dry 
xylene and refluxed with 4 g. of copper bronze for 6 hr., with 
occasional shaking. The xylene solution was filtered while 
hot and concentrated; on cooling the dixanthylene deriva­
tive crystallized. ( cf. Table II).
(b) . One g. of the xanthone after 30 min. boiling with 0.5 
g. of zinc dust and 15 ml. of glacial acetic acid in the pres­
ence of 2-3 drops of coned, hydrochloric acid gave the 
dixanthylene derivative.
(c) . A solution of 1  g. of xanthione in 20 ml. of dry xylene 
was refluxed with 0.5 g. of copper bronze for 6 hr. The 
filtered xylene solution, on concentration, gave the dixan­
thylene derivative.
Dilute solutions of the dixanthylenes Ig,h,k in diphenyl 
ether or anisole are almost colorless at room temperature; 
the boiling solutions are bluish green; the color phenomenon 
is reversible.
A c tio n  o f  th io n y l c h lo rid e . G en era l p ro c ed u re.  A solution of 
1  g. of the appropriate dixanthylene derivative in 30 ml. of 
thionyl chloride was refluxed for 6 hr.; the excess solvent 
was distilled completely (pump), and the residual oil was 
then dissolved in benzene and shaken with water at 30° for30 min. The benzene layer was evaporated and the residual 
was crystallized from benzene-petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°).
2-Chloroxanthone (Va) (melting point and mixed melting 
point and color reaction with sulfuric acid) was obtained in 
73% yield.
Similar treatment of Ih with thionyl chloride gave 68% 
yield of 2-methylxanthone (Vb). 2-Phenylxanthone (Vc) 
was obtained in 66% yield from the corresponding dixan­
thylene derivative (Ii).
4-Methylxanthone (Vd) in 63% yield was, similarly, pro­
duced upon treatment of II with thionyl chloride.
A c tio n  o f s u lfu r . G en era l p ro c ed u re.  One g. of the appro­
priate dixanthylene derivative was ground with 0.5 g. of 
sulfur and the mixture was heated at 270° (bath tempera­
ture) for 10 min., allowed to cool, powdered, and extracted 
repeatedly with hot petroleum ether (b.p. 60-80°). The 
extract was concentrated, cooled, filtered from precipitated 
sulfur, and the bluish green solution was further concen­
trated and cooled.
The xanthiones (VI, listed in Table III) were identified 
by melting point and mixed melting point determination 
with an authentic sample (see below) and by the formation 
of a reddish brown colored surface on the crystals of mer­
curic chloride added to their benzene solutions.1 6
X a n th io n e s . G eneral pro ced u re,  (a). One g. of the xanthone 
was mixed thoroughly with 1.2 g. of phosphorus pentasulfide. 
The mixture was heated for 1  hr. and the solid mass, ob­
tained on cooling, was powdered and extracted several times 
■ w ith  hot benzene ( ca. 50 ml.). The benzene solution was 
evaporated and the solid residue was dissolved in hot 
petroleum ether (b.p. 60-80°) and concentrated; on cool­
ing, the xanthione derivative crystallized. 1 5

(b). The orange oil, obtained by the action of 15 ml. of 
thionyl chloride on 1  g. of the xanthone, us described above, 
was dissoh'ed in 40 ml. of dry benzene and refluxed for f >  hr. 
with 2 ml. of thiolacetic acid during which time a deep 
bluish green color developed. The excess benzene and acid 
were removed by distillation and on addition of light 
petroleum (b.p. 40 60°) to the residue, the xanthione deriva­
tive was deposited; it was recrystallized from petroleum 
ether (b.p. 60-80°).
The xanthiones (listed in Table III) were easily soluble 
in benzene, giving a bluish greet, solution, but sparingly 
soluble in petroleum ether and gave an orange-red color 
with sulfuric acid.
Method (b) was applied in the case of 4-methyl-, 2-meth- 
yl-,1 6  and 2-phenylxanthiones;  the yields were 73, 66, and 
63% respectively.
Action of aromatic, thiols. General proceaure.  A solution of 
2 g. of Va and 1.5 g. of the thiol in 25 ml. of amyl alcohol 
was treated with 0.1 g. of solid potassium hydroxide. The 
reaction mixture was refluxed for 3 hr. and kept overnight 
at room temperature. The yellow solid that separated was 
filtered, washed w  ith cold ethyl alcohol, then with water and 
finally with cold acetone. It was extracted with hot petroleum 
ether (b.p. 60-80°, ca. 60 ml.) and the insoluble part was 
crystallized from glacial acetic acid.
The amylmercapto derivatives VIII (cf. Table IV) were 
oxidized to the corresponding sulfones (IX) as follows; A  
solution of 1  g. of the appropriate arylmereapto derivative 
in 25 ml. of glacial acetic acid was treated with 5 ml. of 
hydrogen peroxide (30%). The reaction mixture was heated 
(steam bath) for 1  hr. and kept overnight at room tempera­
ture. The resulting solid was crystallized from glacial acetic 
acid.
The sulfones IX (Table IV) are colorless, and easily 
soluble in hot xylene, but are sparingly soluble in cold ethyl 
alcohol and acetic acid. They give a pale yellow color with 
sulfuric acid.
Photochemical experiments. General remarks.  The benzene 
was thiophene-free and dried over sodium. The reaction 
mixture was placed in a Schlenk tube1 7  of pyrex glass, and 
the air then was displaced by dry carbon dioxide and the 
tube sealed by fusion.
The photoformation of peroxide was catried out as above, 
but in the presence of dry air. Control experiments in the 
dark, but otherwise under identical conditions, showed no 
reaction.
(a) . 2-Methylxanthene1 6  1 9  and  Vb. A solution of 1  g. of 2- 
methylxanthene and 1.3 g. of Vb in 30 ml. of benzene, after 
being exposed to sunlight for 10 days (July), acquired a green 
fluorescence, and the photoproduct separated during ex­
posure as colorless crystals. These were collected, washed 
with cold benzene (ca. 10 ml.) and recrystallized from hot 
xylene. The yield of 2,2'-dimethyl-9,9'-bixanthene is 0.41 g. 
and melts at 250°.

Thermal decomposition of 0.5 g. of Xlb for half an hour 
at 270° (bath-temp.) afforded 4-chloroxanthone (ca. 0.16

Reduction of substituted xanlhones:  (a). Lithium aluminum  
hydritie. General procedure.  Solvents dried over sodium were 
used. To 0.7 g. of lithium aluminum hydride (Xew Metals 
and Chemicals, Ltd., London) was added 50 ml. of ether. 
After 15 min., a benzene solution (30 ml.) containing 1  g. of 
each of the appropriate xanthone (cf. Table V) was added 
in portions. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 3 hr. 
and then kept overnight at room temperature. After treat­
ment w r ith dilute hydrochloric acid the ethereal solutions 
were evaporated and the oil}’ residues were solidified upon 
washing with light petroleum (b.p. below 40°) and crys­
tallized from the proper solvent (cf. Table V).
(b). Metallic sodium and alcohol.  A solution of 3 g. of each 
of the corresponding xanthone derivatives (cf. Table V) 
in 60 ml. of hot absolute ethyl alcohol was added dropwise 
to 7 g of molten metallic sodium after the method described 
by Heller and Kostanecki.1 '1  The reaction mixture was steam 
distilled. The solid obtained from the distillate was crys­
tallized from the appropriate solvent.
Xanthhydrol derivatives listed in Table V are sparingly 
soluble in petroleum ether (b.p. 50-70°) and difficultly sol­

sulfur.c acid. The xanthene derivatives (cf. Table V) are 
easily soluble in benzene, sparingly soluble in cold ethyl 
alcohol, and give no color with sulfuric acid.
Preparation of 2-phenylxanlhone  (Vc). (a). A procedure

gradually (oil bath) until all the alcohol evaporated. The 
reaction mixture was kept at 150° for half an hour and the 
temperature then was raised to 220°. It was cooled, pow­
dered, and the solid was digested with dilute aqueous so­
dium hydroxide solution (8%, ca. 60 ml.). The filtered alka­

The synthesis of the first mixed indole and indole:pyrrole dimers is described. Theyr are derived from an A component (an 
indole having an open 2-position) and a B component (an indole or pyrrole more nucleophilic than the A component). In­
cluded are the dimers from indole with 2-methyl indole (lb), 1,2-dimethylindole (Ic), 2-phenylindole (Id), or 2,5-dimethyl- 
pyrrole (Xlla), and the dimer from skatole with 2-methvlindole (Ilia). Structures are assigned on the basis of spectral data 
and by analogy with the proven structure of diindole (la). The competitive dimerization reaction of indole and 1-methyl- 
indole permitted isolation, after acylation with maleic anhydride, of only maleyldiindole (XVa). The competitive reaction 
of indole and skatole proceeded in rather clean-cut stepwise fashion with formation first of diindole hydrochloride and then 
of diskatole hydrochloride. A new homodimer, 1,3-dimethylindole dimer (Vlb), has been prepared. Evidence is presented 
concerning the structure of diskatole (Via). As byproducts in the preparation of the mixed dimers, the first mixed trimers 
have been prepared. Included are diindole:2-methylindole trimer (lie); diindole: 1,2-dimethylindole trimer (lid); and in­
dole:  di-2,5-dimethylpyrrole trimer (XIII). Diindole: 1,2-dimethylindole trimer (lid) is different from the dimethyltriindole 
obtained by methylation of triindole (Ila). Evidence is presented that, contrary to a previous report, the latter dimethyl­
triindole is in reality an A ’,A r-dimethylaniline derivative (lib) resulting from dimethylation of the primary amino group of 
triindole. Acyl derivatives of the mixed dimers and trimers have been prepared from maleic, succinic, itaeonic, and citraconic 
anhydrides. Whereas acylation of diindole, indole:2-phenylindole dimer, and indole:2,5-dimet.hylpyrrole dimer with maleic 
anhydride gave only the maleyl derivatives, the corresponding reactions with indole:  2-methylindole dimer and indole: 1,2-
d.methylindole dimer gave not only the maleyl derivatives (XVb-c) but also lesser amounts of the fumaryl derivatives 
(XVI b-c). In the two cases where both maleyl and fumaryl derivatives were obtained, hydrogenation of these stereoisomers 
gave the succinyl derivatives (XVIIb-c), which were also prepared independently by acylation of the dimers with succinic 
anhydride. Skatole:  2-methylindole dimer with maleic anhydride gave the maleyl derivative (Illb), but in more polar solvents 
an isomer was obtained to which the spiro indolenine structure XXI is assigned.

dimers or their derivatives.1 2  The mechanism pro­
posed6  7  for the formation of diindole (la) offered 
hope for the synthesis of mixed indole dimers. 
Requirements for indole dimerization appear to 
include a protonated indole with an open 2-position 
(which we shall designate as the A component) 
and an indole with a nucleophilic position, usually 
an open 3-position (B component). Consequently, 
although its dimer has been prepared by another

tion (Nov. 22, 1957) that he has prepared a mixed diindolyl 
(corresponding to indole:2-methylindole dimer), the forma­
tion of which almost certainly involves an unstable mixed 
indole dimer as an intermediate:

acid-catalyzed dimerization9 ,1 3 “  (an observation we 
have confirmed under our conditions), presumably 
because of the blocking methyl group in the 2- 
position of the A component. 2-Methylindole, how­
ever, is more nucleophilic at the 3-position than 
indole for the same reason that the o-positions of 
toluene are more reactive than any position of ben­
zene. It was hoped, therefore, that 2-methylindole 
would be sufficiently better as a B component than 
indole so that isolation of a mixed dimer would be 
possible.
When dry hydrogen chloride was passed slowly 
into an equimolar solution of indole and 2-methyl­
indole in dry ether, the mixed dimer hydrochloride 
precipitated in quantitative yield. The free indole: 
2-methylindole dimer (lb), an oil, was characterized 
by acylation, which yielded crystalline amide deriv­
atives in up to 57% yield. On some occasions, 
usually when hydrogen chloride was passed 
rapidly  into an ether solution of the reactants, or 
else when moisture was present (possibly causing

hydrogen chloride, there was also isolated, in up 
to 15% yield as the succinyl derivative, and 62% 
yield as the citraconyl derivative, a mixed trimer, 
diindole:2-methylindole trimer (lie). The struc­
ture of this mixed trimer is assigned from analogy 
with :,he structure of triindole (IIa)6 ,1 3 b  and on the 
basis of the elemental analyses of the succinyl 
and citraconyl derivatives and the neutralization 
equivalent of the succinyl derivative.
Similarly prepared were indole :1,2-dimethyl- 
indole dimer (Ic), m.p. 134-135°, also obtained in 
good yield, and the corresponding mixed trimer, 
diindole:l,2-dimethylindole trimer (lid), in 11% 
yield as the maleyl derivative, and in up to 14% 
yield as the free base along with 26% of unchanged
1,2-dimethylindole. The trimer has a melting point 
of 165-166°. A dimethyltriindole, m.p. 165-166°, 
from reaction of triindole with methyl iodide in the 
presence of potassium carbonate, has been described 
previously.1 3  1 4  We have repeated the preparation of 
this dimethyltriindole. It depresses the melting 
points of diindole: 1,2-dimethylindole trimer (lid), 
mixed m.p. 142-145°, and of trindole (m.p. 170- 
171°) mixed m.p. 146-149°.
On the basis of the incorrect assumption that 
no more than one methyl group would become at­
tached to any single nitrogen atom of triindole, 
and the fact that reaction with cyanogen bromide 
replaced only one methyl group of the dimethyl 
derivative, it was claimed1 4  that dimethyltriindole 
contains one C-methyl as well as one A 7 -methyl 
group. The discovery that triindole contains a 
primary amino group,6  however, permits the likely 
assumption that during methylation both methyl 
groups have become attached to the primary amino 
nitrogen, the most nucleophilic site in the triindole 
molecule. All of the reported1 4  reactions of dimethyl­
triindole are consistent with this hypothesis.
We have examined the visible absorption maxima 
of solutions resulting from reaction of p-dimethyl- 
aminobenzaldchvde (Ehrlich reagent) with ani­
line derivatives in 95% ethanol containing per­
chloric acid. The Ehrlich reagent has its longest 
wave-length maximum in the ultraviolet region, 
at 340 m /x. With aniline there results an intense 
Schiff base maximum at 435 m ^ x . With W-methyl- 
aniline there is a less intense maximum at 406 
m /x, and with A r,A r-dimethylaniline, which is in­
capable of forming a Schiff base-type product, 
there is no absorption maximum in the visible 
region.
Triindole (Ila) gives an intense Schiff base maxi- 
mun at 421 m /x (the Schiff base maximum for the

to condensation at the open 2-positions of the in­
tact indole nuclei of triindole. Similarly, diindole:-
1,2-dimethylindole trirner (lid) gives an intense 
Schift base maximum at 417 m^ and less intense 
Ehrlich dye absorption at 545 mp. Dimethyl- 
triindole, on the other hand, gives no Schiff base 
maximum but only Ehrlich dye absorption at the 
corresponding positions (540, inflection, and 564 
mp, maximum). We conclude, therefore, that di- 
methyltriindole is an A T ,iV-dimethylaniline deriva­
tive and we assign to it structure lib.
Indole and 2-phenylindole also give a mixed 
dimer (Id), which was isolated in 23% yield as the 
maleyl derivative. There was no evidence for a 
mixed trirner analogous to those from the reactions 
of indole with 2-methylindole or 1,2-dimethylindole.
Our results suggest the generalization that indole 
will form mixed dimers with 2-substituted indoles 
more nucleophilic than indole itself. Presumably, 
however, at some point the steric hindrance of 
increasingly large substituents in the 2-position 
will so inhibit the formation of mixed dimers that 
diindole, which is also formed rapidly, will become 
the favored product. A comparable situation exists 
between indole and 1-methylindole, which is be­
lieved to be less nucleophilic than indole. In a com­
petitive reaction between equimolar amounts of 
indole and 1-methylindole, a hydrochloride pre­
cipitated in a quantity which accounted for 84% 
of the mixed indoles used (calculated as the mixed 
dimer hydrochloride). From this hydrochloride, 
only diindole was isolated, as the maleyl derivative, 
in 52% yield of the indole used. The failure to 
isolate any other dimer as the maleyl derivative 
shows the absence of indole:l-methylindole dimer 
(Ie), which would have an acylable basic N—H 
group, but does not exclude the possible presence of
1-methylindole lindóle dimer (If) or of 1-methyl­
indole dimer,1 0  to which the structure Ig is assigned 
by analogy with the structure of diindole.
A similar situation exists between indole and 
skatole. The competitive reaction of equimolar 
amounts of indole and skatole proceeded in rather 
clean-cut stepwise fashion. After dry hydrogen chlo­
ride gas had been passed into the ether solution for 
seven minutes, a quantitative precipitate of di­
indole hydrochloride was filtered off. Passing in 
hydrogen chloride was resumed and after thirty- 
eight more minutes an 85% yield of diskatole hy­
drochloride was filtered off. This stepwise formation 
of the homodimers shows that indole is more re­
active than skatole, both as an A component and as 
a B component.
As skatole has an open 2-position, it should be 
capable of forming a mixed dimer with 2-methyl-

Seyler’s,  299, 168(1955).indole. Furthermore, as 2-methylindole is much 
more nucleophilic (thus making it a better B com­
ponent) than skatole, the mixed dimer might form 
in preference to diskatole. In accordance with this 
prediction skatole :2-methylindole dimer (Ilia) 
was obtained, in up to 37% yield as the maleyl 
derivative, but diskatole was also obtained, in 
up to 10% yield as the maleyl derivative, along 
with unchanged 2-methylindole, which was isolated

that the rates of reaction of skatole with 2-methyl- 
indole and with itself are of comparable magnitude.
A proof of structure for diskatole has not yet 
been published.1 7  If the mechanism of skatole 
dimerization parallels that of indole,6  then diska­
tole would have the dibasic indolenine structure IV, 
no longer containing an indole chromophore. The 
ultraviolet spectra of diskatole and several of its 
derivatives (Table I), however, contain the indole 
chromophore. Furthermore, diskatole,1 8 1 9  like di­
indole,4 ’1 3 ’ 20 -2 2  forms a monohydrochloride. The

quently, the indolenine structure IV is not valid

for diskatole. If, in the formation of diskatole, 
protonation of skatole occurs at the 2-position, 
which appears to be the most nucleophilic center ,2 3  
followed by attack at the 3-position by the B com­
ponent from its 2-position, then diskatole would 
have structure V, requiring the formation of a 
quaternary carbon atom. If, however, skatole is 
protonated at the 3-position, followed by attack 
at the 2-position b}r  the B component from its 2- 
position, then the least possible sterically hindered 
structure (Via) for diskatole would result. Con­
sistent with the formulation of diskatole as V or 
Via is the fact that in the Ehrlich test diskatole 
gives Schiff base-type absorption at 442 (inflection) 
and 457 m ju (maximum) but no Ehrlich dye maxi­
mum, indicating the absence of an open 2- or 3- 
position in an indole nucleus. Diindole, in contrast, 
gives both the intense Schiff base-type absorption 
at 442 (inflection) and 453 m /a (maximum) and the 
Ehrlich dye maximum at 568 rrv, in agreement 
with the open 2-position in the indole nucleus of 
diindole. Indole itself gives only Ehrlich dye ab­
sorption at 540 (inflection) and 567 npi (maximum), 
and skatole similarly gives maxima at 545 and 578 
m ju, the latter maxmum being the more intense of 
the two.

(0.2 mm.), and diskatole hydrochloride could even 
be sublimed without decomposition. Nevertheless, 
the reversion of diskatole hydrochloride into 
skatole upon warming with alkali 8 -1 8 appears to 
rule out the possibility of carbon skeletal rear­
rangements occurring during its formation. It 
is interesting to note that 3-ethylindolc, in con­
trast to skatole, has been reported not to dimerize ,1 0  
but this report appears to be in error .2 4
The bisdiskatole oxalate, m.p. 180°, of Oddo 
and Crippa 8 was reinvestigated since the nitrogen 
analysis, which constituted the sole characteriza­
tion, was in better agreement with C 3 8H3 4N4O2, 
bisdiskatole oxamide, than with the formula C 3 8- 
H3 8N4O4 proposed. Our carbon, hydrogen, and 
nitrogen analyses, however, are in agreement 
with the bisdiskatole oxalate formula originally 
proposed.

England, has kindly informed us in a private communication 
(April 28, 1957) that he has found 3-re-propylindole to form 
a beautifully crystalline dimer hydrochloride at about the 
same rate as skatole dimerizes. On the other hand, he has 
prepared pure crystalline 3-t-butylindole and shown that it 
is completely unaffected by hydrochloric acid under condi­
tions which lead to the rapid dimerization of skatole and 
3-it-propylindole.

dimerization proceeds less rapidly. Even after 
hydrogen chloride had been passed into a stirred 
ether solution of 1,3-dimethylindole for three hours, 
the dimer hydrochloride was isolated in only 57% 
yield, and 26% of unchanged 1,3-dimethylindole 
was recovered after distillation.

of a benzenoid system.
The structures of pyrrole dimers and of tripyr­
role show that the 2-position is the point of great­
est reactivity in pyrroles, both when they are acting 
as A components and as B components. It was 
hoped that blocking both 2-positions of the pyr­
role nucleus, as in 2,5-dimethylpyrrole, would 
inhibit homodimerization of the pyrrole, but leave 
(or produce) sufficient reactivity as a B component 
at the 3-position to permit the synthesis of mixed 
indoleipyrrole dimers. This objective was realized 
with indole and 2,5-dimethylpyrrole, which gave 
an almost quantitative precipitate of hydrochlo­
rides, from which indole :2,5-dimethylpyrrole dimer 
(Xlla) was obtained in up to 67% yield as the 
maleyl derivative, and indole :di-2,5-dimetliylpyr- 
role trimer (XIII), m.p. 197-199°, was isolated in 
up to 41% yield.

methylpyrrole has acted as an A component, either

position, are invalid. Structure X lla is left as the 
probable structure for indole :2,5-dimethylpyrroledimer. It is completely analogous to other dimers 
in which indole has acted as an A component.
Indole :di-2,5-dimethylpyrrole trimer is assumed 
to have the analogous structure X III.1 3 a  The ultra­

at 283 m n (log e  3.36), characteristic of the o- 
toluidine system resulting from opening of the 
single indole nucleus. o-Toluidine has maxima in 
alcohol at 284 m^ (log «  3.23) and 234 (3.88).3 0  
In indole :di-2,5-dimethylpyrrole trimer (XIII), 
the lower wave-length o-toluidine band is over­
shadowed by rising end absorption, because of the 
two intact pyrrole nuclei, which, by analogy with 
those in tripyrrole (XI, 219, log e  4.242 7 ), should 
have their maximum below 220 m/i. The strong 
and dominant ultraviolet absorption maxima at 
about 225, 283, and 290 m /x, characteristic of in­
tact indole nuclei, such as those in indole trimers
(II), are absent.
The ultraviolet spectra of indole dimers (Table 
I) represent a composite of the spectra of the 
indole and indoline nuclei which they contain, but 
the indole absorption maxima, being more intense, 
dominate the spectra. The maximum at 240 or 
241 m/j, present in the spectra of indoline and 2- 
methylindoline (see Table I), does appear, however, 
as a weak inflection at 244-248 mu in the spectra of 
many indole dimers (la, di-2-methylindole, Ic, 
Via) and their salts (la, lb, Via). With the dimer 
of 1,3-dimethylindole (VIb), and its hydrochloride, 
the indoline inflection at 249 m^ is of sufficient in­
tensity to become an important part of the spec­
trum. The infrared spectra of acyl derivatives 
of all indole dimers (la, lb, Id, Ilia, Via) not de­
rived from 1-methylindoles, as well as the maleyl 
derivative of indole :2,5-dimethylpyrrole dimer 
(Xlla), contain an NH band (see Table II). 
Thus, in agreement with the structures assigned, 
the original dimers must have contained two NH 
groups and could not have contained an indole 
nucleus in the indolenine form.
Indole :di-2,5-dimethyl pyrrole trimer (XIII) dif­
fers from the mixed indole trimers in that only one 
indole molecule has gone into its formation. Here 
arises an interesting question as to the mechanism 
of formation of mixed indole trimers. The formation 
of trindole is assumed to proceed through nucleo­
philic attack at the 2-position of the indoline por­
tion of protonated diindole by a third indole mole­
cule acting as a B component.6  That the correspond­
ing reaction does not go at an unactivated (though 
much less sterically hindered) 2-position of an 
indoline nucleus is illustrated by the failure of 
indoline to undergo ring opening with 2-methyl- 
indole or 1,2-dimethylindole. After eighteen hours 
in homogeneous ethanolic hydrochloric acid solu­
tion at room temperature, no evidence was found 
for ring opening products; indoline was recovered 
(as 1-succinylindoline) in 97% and 74% yields, 
respectively, along with 72% 1,2-dimethylindole 
in the latter case. With indole dimers, the ease of 
the displacement reaction must depend upon the 
presence of the highly reactive gramine-type sys­
tem; the reaction probably involves a prior ring
(30) P. Grammaticakis, Bull. sue. chim.,  139 (1949).opening to a 3H-pseudoindole intermediate3 1  
(XIV), which then undergoes Michael-type addi­
tion by the B-component. Either a mixed indole 
dimer (lb or Ic) or diindole (la) might serve as 
the intermediate dimer, but the relative ease of 
formation of mixed dimers relative to diindole 
makes it most probable that the mixed dimers are 
the intermediates. If this is true, then the final 
B component must be indole and not the more 
nucleophilic 2-methylindole or 1,2-dimethylindole. 
This can only be because indole would offer the 
minimum steric hindrance to attack at a sterically 
hindered reaction site. 2,5-Dimethylpyrrole, how­
ever, is little more sterically hindered at the 3- 
position than indole. Being more nucleophilic 
than indole, it becomes the successful B component 
in the attack on indole :2,5-dimethylpyrrole dimer 
(Xlla), thus accounting for the two 2,5-dimethyl- 
pyrrole nuclei in indole :di-2,5-dimethylpyrrole 
trimer (XIII).
The physical properties and elemental analyses 
of the mixed indole dimers and trimers and their 
salts are reported in Table III.
Acyl derivatives.  Two of the free dimers were oils 
(lb, X lla) and four others were difficult to isolate 
in pure crystalline form (la, Ic, Id, Ilia), probably 
because of a tendency to dissociate into the mono­
mers. These dimers were commonly isolated as 
their amide derivatives, which had the dual ad­
vantage of being highly crystalline derivatives and 
of being stable with respect to dissociation into the 
monomers, because acylation ties up the electrons on 
the indoline nitrogen. A convenient derivatization 
procedure, commonly employed throughout this 
work, involved neutralization of the dimer and 
trimer hydrochlorides with aqueous ammonia in 
the presence of a water-immiscible organic solvent 
such as methylene chloride or benzene. The solu­
tion of the dimer and trimer in the organic solvent 
was then separated, dried over magnesium carbo­
nate, and acylated, without necessity for isolation 
of the free dimer. Maleic anhydride, or one of its 
derivatives, was usually chosen as the acylating 
agent because the a,|6-unsaturated derivatives of 
the dimers were desired for study in the novel 
rearrangement described in the following paper.3 2
Maleyldiindole1 6  (XVa) was prepared in 90% 
yield from diindole hydrochloride by the acylation 
procedure described above. Succinyldiindole1 6  (X- 
Vlla) was obtained in 93% yield by succinylation 
of diindole. Itaconyldiindole was obtained in 93% 
yield from diindole hydrochloride by acylation of 
the neutralized base with itaconic anhydride. 
Itaconyldiindole underwent alkaline hydrolysis to

tion of hydrochloric acid (from prior hydrolysis of

From indole :2-methylindole dimer hydrochlo­
ride. after neutralization and acylation with maleic 
anhydride, a stereoisomeric pair of maleyl (XVb) 
and fumaryl (XVIb) derivatives was obtained in 
yields of up to 54% and 19%, respectively. A 
novel rearrangement involving these derivatives 
is described in the following paper.3 2  Both stereo­
isomers were hydrogenated over Raney nickel in 
yields of 95% and 88% to the succinyl derivative 
(XVIIb), which was prepared independently by 
substituting succinic anhydride for maleic anhy­
dride in the acylation procedure. Similarly obtained 
were the itaconyl derivative (XVIIIb), in 33% yield 
by acylation with itaconic anhydride, and the citra- 
conyl derivative (XlXb), in 25% yield by acylation 
with citraconic anhydride. The structures of these 
derivatives (XVIIIb, XlXb) are tentatively as­
signed on the basis of their behavior in the novel 
rearrangement and the considerations described 
in the following paper.3 2
From indole:l,2-dimethylindole dimer hydro­
chloride another stereoisomeric pair o" maleyl 
(XVc) and furmaryl (XVIc) derivatives was ob­
tained in yields of 47% and 7%, respectively, by 
acylation with maleic anhydride. Both stereoisomers 
were hydrogenated over Raney nickel to the suc­
cinyl derivative (XVIIc), which was prepared in­
dependently in 93% yield by succinylation of the 
pure dimer. The dimer (Ic) was obtained in yields 
of 98% and 39%, along with fumaric acid, from 
alkaline hydrolysis of the maleyl and fumaryl 
derivatives, respectively.
From indole :2-phenylindole dimer hydrochloride 
only a maleyl derivative (XVd) was obtained, in 
23% yield. A novel rearrangement involving this 
derivative is described in the following paper.3 2  
From indole :2,5-dimethylpyrrole dimer hydro­
chloride again only a maleyl derivative (Xllb) 
was obtained, in 67% yield. Alkaline hydrolysis of 
this derivative gave, along with a quantitative 
yield of fumaric acid, the free dimer as an oil in 
85% yield. This oil w T as reconverted into the maleyl 
derivative in 64% yield.
The reason for the concurrent formation of 
fumaryl as well as maleyl derivatives from maleic 
anhydride and dimers containing an indole with a
2-methyl group, but not from diindole, is unknown. 
An analogous pair of maleyl (Vic) and fumaryl 
(VId) derivatives of diskatole has been described1 6 :  
the maleyl (white, m.p. 194°) being obtained from 
diskatole and maleic anhydride, and the fumaryl 
(yellow, m.p. 246°) from acid-catalyzed dimeriza­
tion of skatole in the presence of maleic anhydride. 
On catalytic hydrogenation both stereoisomers gave 
succinyldiskatole, which was also prepared in­
dependently from succinic anhydride and diskatole. 
In our hands, all attempts to prepare fumaryldiska- 
tole, according to the limited experimental details 
of the procedure1 6  for the reaction of skatole with 
maleic anhydride catalyzed by sulfuric acid, wereunsuccessful. Likewise, attempts to isomerize 
maleyldiskatole to fumaryldiskatole in ethanolic 
solutions containing sulfuric acid or iodine resulted 
in recovery of unchanged maleyldiskatole.
The assignment of configuration to the maleyl 
and fumaryl derivatives of indole dimers is based 
on the greater conjugation showm in the ultraviolet 
spectra (Table II) of the fumaryl derivatives 
(XVIb-c). Also, in the two cases where stereo­
isomeric pairs w r ere obtained, the member to which 
we have assigned the fumaryl configuration has the 
higher melting point (Table IV). The two fumaryl 
derivatives have an absorption band at 318—  
323 mg, not present in the maleyl derivatives or 
any of the other acyl derivatives. In contrast, 
except for the 2-phenyl-substituted case (XVd), 
the maleyl (IHb, Vic, X llb, XVa-c), as well as the 
succinyl (XVIIa-c), itaconyl (XVIIIa-b), and 
citraconyl (XlXb) derivatives, but not the fumaryl 
derivatives, have an absorption maximum in the 
252-269 mg region, which is also characteristic of 
the maleyl and succinyl indolines (250-255 mg). 
The corresponding maximum in benzenesulfonyl- 
diindole (XXa) occurs at 271 mg. These maxima are 
completely lacking in the corresponding derivatives 
(Ile-g) of indole trimers (Ilc-d). The trimers and 
their derivatives lack the indoline structure and, 
except for a band at 274 mg in the citraconyl deriva­
tive (Ilf), have only normal indole absorption. 
Besides the absorption bands mentioned above, all 
of the indole dimers, trimers, and their deriva­
tives have the absorption bands associated wdth 
the indole nucleus, which occur at about 218- 
229 and 280-294 mg. In the 2-phenylindole-sub- 
stituted case (XVd) these bands have undergone 
the usual bathoehromic shifts of about 10 mg 
characteristic of 2-phenylindole and its derivatives.
All of the acyl derivatives containing unsatura­
tion conjugated with the carboxamide group 
(maleyl, fumaryl, and citraconyl), except maleyl­
diskatole, are yellow in color (Table IV) because of 
a broad tailing out of ultraviolet absorption maxima 
into the visible region. The yellow color is instantly 
discharged when the free carboxyl group of the 
derivatives is neutralized by conversion to a salt. 
This fact is illustrated by conversion of yellow ma- 
leyldiindole:l,2-dimethylindole trimer (Ilg) to its 
colorless potassium salt (Table IV). In contrast to 
the yellow unsaturated acid derivatives, all of the 
unconjugated acyl derivatives (such as the suc­
cinyl and itaconyl) are colorless.
Maleic anhydride acylation of the neutralization 
products of the viscous, oily mixture of hydro­
chlorides from the skatole :2-methylindole reaction 
gave a variety of products. Included among these 
were maleyldiskatole (Vic) and the 1:1 and 2:1 
adducts of 2-met hylindole with maleic anhydride.1 6  
When benzene was used as a solvent for acylation, 
the maleyl derivat ive (Illb) of skatole ^-methyl- 
indole dimer began to precipitate after two minutes

pound is soluble in acid as well as base; (2) The 
infrared spectrum in Xujol contains no XH band, 
but does contain a single very strong carbonyl

ring lactam carbonyl and a carboxyl carbonyl.

Compound XXI is of great interest because it 
appears to have the structure proposed for the 
intermediate of the alkaline hydrolysis rearrange­
ment .3 2 It is assumed to arise from the maleyl 
derivative (Illb) by addition of the nucleophilic
3-position of the 2-methylindole nucleus to the 
electrophilic double bond of the maleyl group at a 
position /S - to the carboxamide group, followed by 
a proton transfer to the anionic a-carbon. If addi­
tion at the d-carbon were reversible, then configura­
tional instability of the intermediate anion, or 
loss from the a-carbon of a different proton from 
the one which had added, could result in isomeriza­
tion of the double bond to the fumaryl configura­
tion. If the addition compounds formed in the in­
dole : 2-methylindole and indole:l, 2-dimethylindole 
series, analogous to XXI in the skatole ^-methyl- 
indole series, formed but were relatively unstable, 
then they could serve as intermediates in formation 
of the fumaryl derivatives XVIb-c. As no clearcut 
evidence has as yet been obtained for isomerization 
of maleyl to fumaryl derivatives during purification 
by recrystallization, this possibility may not be 
admissible. A plausible alternative, which would 
account for isomerization during  acylation, wouldbe amine catalysis by reversible addition to the 
double bond by not yet acylated dimer.

the rate was increased until saturation was achieved after 
about 1  hr. The light yellow precipitate was filtered and 
dried in a vacuum desiccator (21.92 g., 0.0770 mole, 101%),

more yellow crystals (3.04 g.), m.p. 154-156° dec., were 
obtained, making the total 9.18 g., 0.0265 mole, 38%. One

aside for a longer time (3 days) another yellow crystalline 
compound (4.62 g., 0.0133 mole, 19%), m.p. 212-216° dec., 
was obtained. Three recrystallizations from acetone (or 
acetonitrile) yielded 2-methyl-3-( l-fumaryl-2-indolinyl)- 
indole as yellow microcrystals, m.p. 215-217° dec. with 
carbon dioxide evolution.

The maleyl and fumaryl derivatives of indole:  2-methylindole dimer (lb) and the maleyl derivatives of skatole: 2-methyl" 
indole dimer (cfs-Id) and of indole:2-phenylindole dimer (cis-Ic) rearrange under alkaline hydrolysis conditions to the corre­
sponding (2-methyl-3-indole)succinic acid (lib) in the first three cases, or (2-phenyl-3-indole)succinic acid (lie) in the latter 
case. The 2-substituent labels the indole nucleus to which migration of the maleyl or fumaryl group has occurred. Besides 
by means of the rearrangement, (2-phenyl-3-indole)succinic acid (lie) has been prepared from the reaction of 2-phenylindole 
with maleic acid. The corresponding anhydride, (2-phcnyl-3-indole)suc3inic anhydride, has been prepared from the diacid by 
anhydride exchange with acetic anhydride. For rearrangement to occur, the necessity of a hydrogen on nitrogen of the indole 
nucleus has been demonstrated. This is shown by the fact that the maleyl and fumaryl derivatives of indole: 1,2-dimethyl- 
indole dimer (Ie) undergo simple alkaline hydrolysis, without rearrangement, to the dimer and fumaric acid. A mechanism 
for the rearrangement is proposed in which the maleyl or fumaryl group is transferred intramolecularly through a six-mem- 
bered spiro ring intermediate from the 1-position of the indoline nucleus to the 3-position of the indole nucleus in the dimer 
with subsequent depolymerization. The isolation of an isomer of maleyl skatole:2-methylindole dimer, for which the spiro 
ring structure of the intermediate has been proposed, lends further support to the proposed intermediate in the mechanism. 
This isomer rearranges under alkaline hydrolysis conditions to the same product (lib) as maleyl skatole: 2-methylindole 
dimer. Home of the limits of the rearrangement are delineated by the facts that, like maleyl and fumaryldiskatole (VII), 
maleyl indole:2,5-dimethylpyrrole dimer (VIII) and itaconyldiindole undergo simple amide hydrolysis without rearrange­
ment. Some of the value of the rearrangement, besides in the synthesis of (3-indole)succinic acid (Ila),4  is illustrated by the 
fact that both the itaconyl (IX) and citraconyl (ci's-X) derivatives of indole:2-methylindole dimer rearrange to the same 
new diacid, for which the 2-methyl-2-( 2-methy 1-3-indole )succinic acid structure (XI) is proposed. This diacid is different 
from another new diacid (XII) derived from hydrolysis of the anhydride adduct of 2-methylindole and itaconic anhydride. 
Likewise, the anhydrides of the two diacids are different.
We have previously shown that rearrangement of 
maleyldiindole (cfs-Ia) under alkaline hydrolysis 
conditions yields (3-indole)succinic acid (Ila).4  
It was established that (3-indole) succinic acid does 
not form by addition of indole to maleate or fum- 
arate anions, which might have resulted from prior 
alkaline hydrolysis of maletddiindcle. It follows 
then that during the rearrangement the 3-position 
of either the indoline or the indole nucleus of di­
indole must add to the a,/3-unsaturation of the 
maleyl group.
Two possible reaction mechanisms, both in­
volving six-membered ring intermediates, were con­
sidered as most plausible. One mechanism would 
require that a benzyl hydrogen at the 3-position of 
the indoline portion of maleyldiindole (cis-Ia) 
be sufficiently acidic so that a benzyl anion is 
formed, which could undergo intramolecular 
Michael addition to the maleyl or fumaryl group, 
forming the bicyclic six-membered ring intermediate 
(or transition state) III. Cleavage of the acyl-nitro-

tion of III (resulting in a transient ketene inter­
mediate) or cleavage could be the result of sub­
sequent amide hydrolysis. In either case, the anion 
on nitrogen would have to depolymerize by elimi­
nating an indole molecule, thus forming the in- 
dolenine IV, which would rapidly tautomerize to 
(3-indole)succinate Ila anion.
If maleyldiindole rearranges according to this 
mechanism, then 1-maleylindoline and l-maleyl-2- 
methylindoline might undergo a similar cvcliza- 
tion step, perhaps more easily because of the absence 
of a large hindering substituent at the 2-position. 
In these cases, however, the (3-indoline) succinic 
acids should represent stable end products, since 
the hydrogen or methyl substituents in the 2- 
positicn should eliminate less readily as anions 
than indole. 1-Maleylindoline and l-maleyl-2- 
methylindoline were prepared and subjected to the 
alkaline hydrolysis conditions of the rearrangement. 
They did not rearrange, but underwent simple 
amide hydrolysis instead. Indoline and 2-methyl- 
indoline were recovered as the picrates in 87 and 
89% yields, respectively, along with 74 and 79% 
yields of fumaric acid, the alkaline isomerization 
product of maleic acid. Consequently, the validity 
of the mechanism proposed for the rearrangement 
of ma_eyldiindole, in which the maleyl group is 
transferred intramolecularly from the 1- to the 
3- position of the indoline nucleus through inter­
mediates like III, has not been demonstrated in 
these cases.

of benzene for each two molecules of 1-maleylindo- 
line. When dropped on a hot block, the yellow 
crystals melt at 128-130°, with the evolution of 
benzene, and then solidify to the white, benzene- 
free compound, m.p. 155-156.5° dec. When heated 
slowly, the yellow crystals turn white and evolve 
their benzene quantitatively within ten minutes at 
100°. The white compound is reconverted to the 
yellow benzene complex upon recrystallization 
from benzene. 1-Succinylindoline was also prepared 
for the purpose of comparison of its physical prop­
erties.
The other most plausible mechanism for the re­
arrangement of maleyldiindole (c¿s-Ia) involves 
initiation (V) by removal of the acidic proton 
from nitrogen of the indole nucleus, giving a reso­
nance-stabilized anion, quite probable under the 
alkaline conditions employed. Although neutral
3-alkylindoles normally undergo electrophilic sub­
stitution at the 2- position,5  and indole anions add 
preferentially at the 1-position in miermolecular 
Michael additions,6  steric factors in this intra-  
molecular case would favor Michael addition (V) 
of the indole anion at its 3- position, yielding the 
six-membered spiro ring intermediate (or transi­
tion state) VI. Rapid alkaline hydrolysis of this 
intermediate (or of the ketene derivable from it 
by a concerted elimination) and elimination of an 
indole molecule would then yield (3-indole) suc- 
cinate(IIa) anion. This elimination reaction is 
seen to be an example of Grab’s “Principle of

To test the validity of this mechanism for the 
rearrangement, it is necessary to label one indole 
nucleus so that it can be distinguished from the 
other in the dimer. Conceivably this objective can 
be accomplished by labeling one of the indole 
nuclei with isotopic carbon or nitrogen. The pres­
ently available method of synthesis of diindole, by 
acid-catalyzed dimerization of indole, offers no 
hope, however, of specificity in this regard. Con­
sequently, we turned to the synthesis of mixed 
indole dimers, which would contain the desired 
distinguishing label in the form of a substituent on 
one of the indole nuclei, the location of which must 
be established unambiguously. This is the subject 
of our preceding paper.8
Both the maleyl and fumaryl derivatives of in­
dole:  2-methylindole dimer (lb) rearranged under 
alkaline hydrolysis conditions to (2-methyl-3- 
indole)succinic acid (lib) in yields of 96% and 87%, 
respectively. Xo (3-indole)succinic acid (Ila) 
was formed, but indole was obtained in yields of 
87% and 72%. The fact that both the maleyl and 
fumaryl derivatives rearrange shows that the steric 
requirements of the reaction at the double bond are

not a dominant factor. Likewise, a 3-methyl sub­
stituent on the indoline nucleus does not inhibit 
the reaction; the maleyl derivative of skatole: 2- 
methylindole dimer (Id) rearranged to (2-methyl- 
3-indole)succinic acid (lib, 100%) and skatole 
(95%). Similarly, the maleyl derivative of indole:- 
2-phenylindole dimer (Ic) rearranged to (2 
phenyl-3-indole)succinic acid (lie, 86%) and in­
dole (79%). Since (2-phenyl-3-indole)succinic acid 
was previously unknown, it was prepared inde­
pendently in 70% yield by wanning 2-phenylindole 
with maleic acid according to a modification of the 
method of Noland and Lange9  for (2-methyl-3- 
indole) succinic acid. (2-Phenyl-3-indole)succinic 
acid (lie), which appeared to be unstable and did 
not crystallize well from other solvents, was best 
isolated from acetonitrile as a stable, crystalline 
solvent complex containing one molecule of aceto­
nitrile for each two molecules of the acid. The acid 
was converted to the corresponding anhydride by 
anhydride exchange with acetic anhydride.
The results of the hydrolysis experiments in­
volving derivatives of mixed indole dimers support 
the mechanism proposed for the rearrangement in 
which a maleyl (or fumaryl) group is transferred 
through intermediates like V and VI from the in­
doline to the indole nucleus of the dimer. The neces­
sity in the rearrangement for an initiating step in 
which a proton is removed from nitrogen of the in­
dole nucleus is suggested by experiments in which 
the N—H group of the indole nucleus is replaced by 
an X—CH3  group. Alkaline hydrolysis of both the 
maleyl and fumaryl derivatives of indole:  1,2- 
dimethylindole dimer (Ie) gave only the regenerated 
dimer in yields of 98% and 39%, respectively, 
along with fumaric acid, but no (l,2-dimethyl-3- 
indole)succinic acid.8  These results indicate that 
the rearrangement does not proceed with maleyl 
and fumaryl derivatives of mixed indole dimers con­
taining substituents other than hydrogen on nitro­
gen of the indole nucleus.
Of great interest in connection with proposal 
of VI as an intermediate in the rearrangement is 
the isolation from acylation of skatole:  2-methyl- 
indole dimer with maleic anhydride in more polar 
solvents of a product for which a structure analo­
gous to the keto form of VI has been proposed.8  This 
rearrangement product (XXI in the preceding 
paper8 ) further rearranged under alkaline hydroly­
sis conditions in the same manner as its isomer, 
the maleyl derivative of skatole :2-methylindole 
dimer (Id), to give (2-methyl-3-indole)succinic 
acid (lib) in 94% yield, and skatole in 94% yield.
Maleyldiskatole and fumaryldiskatole are re­
ported to undergo alkaline hydrolysis without 
rearrangement, yielding diskatole and fumaricacid.1 0  Since the structure of diskatole has been 
proved by degradation,1 1  its maleyl and fumaryl 
derivatives will have the corresponding structures 
(VII). In these cases failure to rearrange is not 
due to lack of an N—H group on the indole nu­
cleus.
If rearrangement were to occur at the 2- position, 
a common site for electrophilic substitution in 
skatole,5  then structures VII would lead to a six- 
memtered ring intermediate which would possess 
a driving force for elimination of a skatole molecule. 
That such rearrangement does not occur may be 
attributed to the lower nucleophilicity in indoles 
of a 2- position relative to a correspondingly 
substituted 3- position. For these diskatole deriva­
tives to cyclize at the 3- position to intermediates 
analogous to VI would require the sterically less 
probable formation of a seven-membered ring. 
Even if such cyclization were to occur, however, 
a driving force for the elimination phase of the 
rearrangement would be lacking. Consequently, 
it is logical that the rearrangement does not occur 
with diskatole derivatives.
The maleyl derivative of indole ^^-dimethyl- 
pyrrole dimer (VIII) also underwent a.kaline 
hydrolysis without rearrangement, giving the 
dimer in 85% yield, along with a quantitative 
yield of fumaric acid.8  The failure of this derivative 
to rearrange must be attributed to low nucleophili­
city of the 3- position of the 2,5-dimethylpyrrole 
nucleus, which permits the rate of simple amide 
hydrolysis to exceed substantially the rate of rear­
rangement. Perhaps low acidity of the pyrrole 
N—H, which, unlike the indoles, lacks an A-phenyl

substituent, makes anion formation relatively 
difficult.
The rearrangement described in this paper may 
have little practical value for the synthesis of (2- 
substituted-3-indole)succinic acids since they are 
conveniently prepared directly by addition of 2- 
substit-uted indoles to maleic acid.9  The rearrange­
ment does have value, however, in the synthesis of 
(3-indole)succinic itself,4  and may have value in 
the preparation of (3-indole)propionic acids and 
their derivatives substituted in any position but 
the 1- position of the indole nucleus, starting from 
the appropriate acrylic derivatives of indole 
dimers. This phase of our research is currently 
under investigation.
In hope of using the rearrangement to synthesize 
(3-indole) succinic acids containing additional sub­
stituents in the succinic acid sidechain, we have 
prepared the itaconyl (IX) and citraconyl (cis-X)  
derivatives of indole :  2-methylindole dimer and 
shown that they are different compounds.8  Both 
derivatives rearranged under alkaline hydrolysis 
conditions to the same new diacid, m.p. 223-224.5° 
dec., in yields of 72% and 37%, along with indole 
in yields of 53 and 81%, respectively. This diacid 
is assigned the structure 2-methyl-2-(2-methyl-3- 
indole)succinic acid (XI), although the alternative 
structure, 2-methyl-3-(2-methyl-3-indole)succinic 
acid, has not been rigorously excluded. Assignment 
of structure XI to the diacid is based on the follow­
ing plausible assumptions with respect to the struc­
ture of its acylated dimer precursors: (1) that, 
with itaconic anhydride, acylation has occurred at 
the less sterically hindered and less resonance 
stabilized, saturated carbonyl group; and (2) 
that, with citraconic anhydride, acylation has oc­
curred at the less sterically hindered carbonyl 
group, the one j3 - to the methyl group.
It is evident that, under the alkaline conditions 
employed, the double bond of either the itaconyl 
or the citraconyl derivative has rearranged to the 
alternative position. That it is the double bond of 
the itaconyl derivative which has rearranged (into 
conjugation with both carbonyl groups) is estab­
lished by the fact that the diacid product, m.p. 
223-224.5° dec., is different from another new 
diacid, m.p. 149-151° dec., obtained by hydrolysis 
of the anhydride adduct of 2-methylindole and 
itaconic anhydride. Since the latter was formed 
under mild, nonalkaline conditions, the double bond 
of itaconic anhydride is assumed not to have rear­
ranged prior to addition of 2-methylindole; con­
sequently, structure XII appears to be established 
for the diacid, m.p. 149-151° dec., derived from 
this anhydride adduct. The anhydride, m.p. 144°, 
prepared from XI by anhydride exchange with 
acetic anhydride, like the parent diacids, was dif­
ferent from the anhydride adduct, m.p. 134-135°, 
from 2-methylindole and itaconic anhydride. The re­
actions of 2-methylindole with citraconic acid orcitraconic anhydride failed to give either the di­
acids XI or XII or the corresponding anhydrides. 
Consequently, the rearrangement has synthetic 
value for the preparation of the diacid XI.
In contrast to the itaconyl derivative of indole: 2- 
methylindole dimer (IX), which underwent double 
bond isomerization and then rearrangement, ita- 
conyldiindole underwent alkaline hydrolysis with­
out rearrangement, giving diindole in 67% yield, 
along with mesaconic acid, an isomerization 
product of itaconic acid, in 81% yield. The failure 
of itaconyldiindole to rearrange must be attrib­
uted to the lower nucleophilicity of the indole 
nucleus (relative to that of 2-methylindole), 
combined with a possibly greater rate of hydrolysis 
of the less hindered amide linkage, a rate which 
must substantially exceed the combined rates of 
double bond isomerization and subsequent rear­
rangement involving nucleophilic attack at a 
relatively hindered tertiary carbon atom.
Our work on the rearrangement has so far been 
carried out with hydrolysis under heterogeneous 
conditions, by refluxing with aqueous 30% hy­
droxide solution, and the yields have been good. 
It may be more convenient and desirable from a 
synthetic standpoint, however, to carry out the 
rearrangement under homogeneous conditions, 
in alcoholic alkali. Our experience indicates that 
(3-indole) succinic acid can be prepared in this 
way (see Experimental) in as good yield, and in a 
purer initial state, than by the method previously 
described.4  A new and convenient synthesis of 
(3-indole) succinic acid has recently been reported.1 2

liquid-liquid extractor for 24 hr. Evaporation of the ether 
gave a white solid (1.35 g.), m.p. 198-205° dec. One recrys­
tallization from acetonitrile gave (2-methy 1-3-indole )suc- 
cinic acid as a white powder (1.19 g., 0.00482 mole, 94%), 
m. p. 209-210.5° dec., mixed m.p. 208-210° dec. with an au­

ous 30% potassium hydroxide (50 cc.) for 3 hr. Indole sub­
limed into the condenser during the reflux period. The reac­
tion mixture was cooled and extracted with ether to remove 
indole. Considerable material (3.08 g.) was insoluble in both 
the ether and aqueous alkaline layers. This was assumed to 
be largely the potassium salt of unchanged starting material. 
It was refluxed with fresh aqueous 30% potassium hydroxide 
(50 ce.) for an additional 4 hr. and then worked up in the 
same manner as the original reaction mixture. This time no 
water- and ether-insoluble material remained. The original 
aqueous layer was acidified to Congo Red with 46% sul­
furic acid, the solution evaporated to dryness on a steam 
bath, and the residue extracted with ether in a Soxhlet ex­
tractor for a day. Evaporation of the ether left a light pink 
residue of (2-phenyl-3-indole) succinic acid, m.p. 255-258° 
dec.
The total yields of products were: indole (0.35 +  0.55 g., 
0.00767 mole) 79%, m.p. 50-51° after sublimation, and 
(2-phenyl-3-indole)succinic acid (1.33 +  1.26 g., 0.00838

cats. Recent unpublished studies in our laboratories 
have shown that 5-methoxy-.Y,.Y-dimethylt rypt- 
amine (o-methylbufotenine) is a more potent rage- 
producing substance than any of the substituted 
/3-phenethylamines thus far studied. The work re­
ported in this communication was undertaken with 
the idea of determining whether chloro or methyl 
groups introduced into the benzenoid ring of 
.V,.Y-dimethyltryptamine would yield compounds 
having psychopharmacological activities compar­
able with the corresponding substituted /3-phen- 
ethylamines.
The desired tryptamines were synthesized by 
application of the general method of Speeter and

as shown in Chart I. None of these reactions re­
quires specific comment beyond the fact that the

5,A’,.Y-Trimethyltryptamine (IV), which could not 
be converted to a crystalline hydrochloride, was 
finally isolated as the hydrogen maleate. The re­
maining tryptamines, VIII, XII, and XIV, formed 
stable and well defined crystalline hydrochlorides.
The synthesis of 5,6,7,V,V-pent.amethyltrypt-

When 3,4,5-trimethylacetophenone was subjected 
to a haloform reaction with potassium hypochlorite 
solution, degradation of the side chain to the ex­
pected carboxyl group occurred with simultaneous 
nuclear halogénation; the resulting compound was 
identified as 2-chloro-3,4,5-trimethylbenzoic acid. 
Nuclear halogénation during the Hoffman reaction 
between certain aromatic amides and sodium hypo- 
bromite is well known,5  and sodium hypochlorite

However, when 3,4,5-trimethylacetophenone6  was 
treated with cold sodium hypobromite solution 
and allowed to react for eighteen hours, the halogen- 
free 3,4,5-trimethylbenzoic acid (XV) was obtained 
in 56% yield. After XV had been converted to the 
acid chloride XVI, the latter compound was 
changed to the aldehyde XVII by the action of 
hydrogen in the presence of the usual Rosenmund 
catalyst. Although the yield of 3,4,5-trimethyl- 
benzaldehyde (XVII) was somewhat variable, 
depending upon reaction conditions, it was found 
that, by carrying out this reduction step in re­
fluxing toluene for twenty-five hours, there re­
sulted a 66% yield of the purified aldehyde XVII; 
a shorter reaction period in refluxing xylene gave 
lower yields.

acid mixture, since only unchanged XVII could be 
isolated from the final mixture. Nitration with 
mixed acid at 15°-20° afforded only the dinitra­
tion product 2,6-dinitro-3,4,5-trimethylbenzalde- 
hyde. Howefer, by carrying out the nitration of 
XVII in sulfuric acid by the addition of solid potas­
sium nitrate in accordance with a modification of 
the procedure given by Eichengrun and Einhorn,7  
the desired 2-nitro-3,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (X- 
VIII) was obtained in 89% yield, based on un­
recovered XVII.
The base-catalyzed condensation of the nitro- 
aldehyde XVIII with nitromethane using the 
procedure of Huebner et a l.s  gave a mixture of the
2,0-dinilrostyrene XIX and the corresponding 
nitroalcohol. Dehydration of the mixed product 
with sodium acetate-acetic anhydride gave pure
3,4,5-trimethyl-2,/3-dinitrostyrene (XIX) in 76% 
yield.
Initially, the cyclization of XIX to 5,6,7-trimethyl- 
indole (XXI) was attempted using the iron powder- 
acetic acid procedure of Ek and Witkop,9  since we 
had successfully prepared 5,6,7-trimethoxyindole 
from 3,4,5-trimethoxy-2,(3-dinitrostyrene1 0  using 
these reagents. However, none of the desired 
indole XXI could be isolated from the final re­
action mixture. In an alternative approach to this 
cyclization, XIX in methanol-acetic acid-ethyl 
acetate solution was subjected to a low-pressure 
hjrlrogenation in the presence of a 10% palladium- 
on-charcoal catalyst.8  The hydrogen uptake ceased 
at approximately 60% of the volume calculated 
to convert XIX completely to XXI. Although the 
crude reaction product gave a positive Ehrlich 
reaction, none of the indole XXI could be isolated 
by conventional methods. There was obtained 
from this reduction mixture a small amount of 2- 
nitro-3,4,5-trimethylphenylacetaldoxime(XX). The 
partial catalytic reduction of /3-nitrostyrene in 
neutral solution to phenylacetaldoxime and poly­
molecular reduction products has been described 
by Kohler and Drake,1 1  whereas in strongly acid 
media, complete reduction to /3-phenethylamine1 2  
occurs.
Walker1 3  has shown that the course of the re­
duction of certain o-nitrophenylacetonitriles to 
indoles is drastically influenced by the acidity of 
the medium. Thus, the intermediate o-aminophenyl- 
acetonitrile can undergo internal amidine forma­
tion and this, in turn, forms a protonated amidinium

reduction to the indole. Since the formation of 
similar stable protonated ions might be a possibility 
during the reductive cyclization of XIX in the pres­
ence of acetic acid, the hydrogenation was repeated 
using ethyl acetate-methanol as a reaction me­
dium. The hydrogen uptake was rapid, exothermic, 
and quantitative. Under these conditions 5,6,7- 
trimethylindole (XXI) was obtained in 50% yield.
5,6,7,N,.V-Pentamethyltryptamine (XXIV) was 
obtained v ia the indole glyoxalyl chloride (XXII) 
and the amide (XXIII), which was reduced by 
means of lithium aluminum hydride.4  The free base 
XXIV was finally converted to the hydrochloride.
3-Chlorobenzaldehyde was selected as the start­
ing material for the synthesis of the intermediate
5-chloroindole (V) required for the preparation of
VIII. By following the reaction scheme
m-cKorobenzaldehyde3-chloro-6-nitro-
benzaldehyde
Cl
V
the chloroaldehyde was first, converted to 2-nitro-5- 
ehlorobenzaldehyde (XXV) in 66% yield by the 
method7  already described for the preparation of 
XVIII. A base-catalyzed condensation of XXV 
with nitromethane in which tri-n-butylamine was 
used failed to give the nitroolefin XXVII. When the 
condensation was then repeated following the al­
coholic alkali procedure of Worral,1 4  a-(2-nitro-5- 
chlorophenyl)-,8-nitroethanol was obtained rather 
than the expected XXVII. Dehydration of XXVI 
with anhydrous sodium acetate and acetic anhy­
dride afforded a satisfactory yield of 5-chloro-2, 
/3-din:trostyrene (XXVII).
When the reductive cyclization of XXVII was 
attempted in accordance with the method described 
by Huebner,8  indole was obtained instead of 5- 
chloroindole. This result is not surprising in light 
of the findings of Strel’ tsova and Zelinskii,1 5  who 
have demonstrated that hydrogenolysis of the 
halo group occurs simultaneously with reduction 
of the nitro group when either 2- or 4-chloronitro- 
benzene is treated with hydrogen in the presence of 
a noble-metal catalyst (palladium or platinum).

Since 5-chloroindole became commercially avail­
able during this study, this was used in the syn­
thesis of the tryptamine VIII.
The 6-chloroindole (IX) required for the synthe­
sis of XII and XIV was prepared from 2-nitro-4- 
chlorotoluene following the route of Rydon and 
Tweedle1 6  in which this starting compound is 
first condensed with ethyl oxalate to give 4- 
chloro-2-nitrophenylpyruvic acid, which is next 
cyclized to 6-chloroindole-2-carboxylic acid by 
treatment with ferrous hydroxide; the acid is 
finally^ subjected to thermal decarboxylation in 
the presence of a copper chromite catalyst to 
give 6-chloroindole (IX).

solution of 10 g. of I in 200 ml. of dr}r ether was treated with 
12 ml. of oxalyl chloride in 15 ml. of dry ether. The resulting 
insoluble glyoxalyl chloride (II) was collected, rapidly 
washed with additional dry ether, and resuspended in the 
same solvent. To the cold stirred slurry of II there was added 
dropwise 10.6 g. of anhydrous dimethylamine in dry ether. 
Stirring was continued for 1  hr. and then the reaction mix­
ture was filtered and washed with additional ether. The crude 
cake was slurried in -water to remove the soluble dimethyl- 
amine hydrochloride and finally collected. Recrystallization 
from hot benzene-ethanol gave 14.4 g. (82.2%) of pure III 
as colorless needles; m.p. 184-185°.

of 9.9 g. of lithium aluminum hydride in 300 ml. of dry ether 
was added portionwise and cautiously a slurry of 14.4 g. of III 
in about 100 ml. of hot, dry benzene using additional dry 
ether to transfer the last of the solid. The mixture was re­
fluxed for an additional hour, cooled in an ice bath, and 
cautiously treated with water to decompose excess hydride 
and the reaction complex. The ether-benzene solution of the 
product was filtered from the insoluble inorganic salts, 
dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the 
filtrate treated with hydrogen chloride gas. The precipitated 
oily salt could not be induced to crystallize and therefore 
the free base was regenerated with alkali. Vacuum distilla­
tion of the crude amine, b.p. 140-142°/0.3 mm., gave a 
colorless oil which crystallized to give 7.6 g. (59%) of base 
IV; m.p. 99-100°. To a solution of 6.0 g. of IV in boiling 
isopropyl acetate there was added a hot solution of 3.0 g.

exceed 15°. Following the addition, the entire mixture was 
kept at about 0-5° for 2 hr. and then the resulting semi­
solid mass was dissolved in 700 ml. of an ice water mixture. 
The resulting clear yellow solution was poured slowly into 
a solution of 132 ml. of coned. Imfrochloric acid in 198 ml.

value of hydrogen was absorbed within about 2.25 hr. When 
the hydrogenation mixture w-as filtered free of ammonium 
acetate and spent catalyst, the deep blue filtrate was 
washed three times with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, 
dried, and evaporated i n  vacuo.  Distillation of the residue 
gave a main fraction, b.p. 95-98° (0.1 mm.), of a colorless 
product which was recrystallized from petroleum ether 
(b.p. 30-60°): 6.1 g.; m.p. 52.5-53°. The product gave a

benzene. After refluxing and stirring for 1  hr., the product 
was worked up by the careful addition of enough water to 
hydrolyze the reaction complex and the excess reagent. 
After filtration, the ether-benzene layer was dried (mag­
nesium sulfate) and treated with dry hydrogen chloride gas. 
The crude amine hydrochloride amounted to 5.1 g. (91%)

and washed with 40 ml. of cold water. The combined filtrates 
were heated to 55° (stirring), and 50 g. of 3,4,5-trimethyl- 
acetophenone was added in one portion. The resulting exo­
thermic reaction was controlled by occasionally immersing 
the flask in an ice bath so that the internal temperature re­
mained at 60-70°. When no further temperature rise was 
noted, the mixture was cooled and stirrer: for 40 min. at 
room temperature. The cold solution was first treated with 
3 g. of sodium metabisulfite in 120 ml. of water to decom­

barium sulfate catalyst. The suspension was mechanically 
stirred and refluxed while dry hydrogen gas (passed through 
sulfuric acid) was bubbled through the mixture for a 24-hr. 
period. After filtering (Xorite) free of spent catalyst, the 
filtrate was stripped at diminished pressure and the residue 
subjected to a vacuum distillation. Following a small fore­
cut, the aldehyde XVII (72.2 g.; 74%) was collected as a 
colorless oil (b.p. 80-85°/0.15 mm.) which rapidly crys­
tallized in the receiver. Recrystallization from petroleum

filtered, and evaporated to a small volume of brown oil. 
This was taken up in 90 ml. of 1 :1 benzene-petroleum ether 
(b.p. 30-60°) and passed through a column of chroma­
tographic alumina (45 g.), which was, in turn, washed with 
100 ml. of the same solvent mixture followed by 50 ml. of 
benzene. The effluent from the column was evaporated i n 
vacuo  to give a light yellow oil which crystallized when tri­
turated with petroleum ether. Recrystallization from hot 
petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) gave 1.7 g. (42.8%) of color­
less prisms, m.p. 66-67°.

To a hot solution of 16.5 g. of XIX in 200 ml. of ethyl ace­
tate, 25 ml. of ethanol, and 25 ml. of glacial acetic acid was 
added 2 g. of 10% palladium-on-charcoal catalyst. The mix­
ture was placed in a Parr hydrogenation apparatus at an ini­
tial hydrogen pressure of 60 p.s.i. Over a period of 1.2 hr.,
24.4 p.s.i. of hydrogen was taken up (theory 35 p.s.i.) by thesample. The reaction mixture, was filtered free of the spent 
catalyst, and the resulting dark filtrate was washed with 5% 
sodium bicarbonate. After drying the organic layer over an­
hydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvent was removed under 
reduced pressure, and the dark residue distilled. A fraction 
amounting to 4.2 g. of a semisolid product boiling at 160- 
165°/0.7 mm. was collected and triturated with benzene- 
petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) to give 1.1 g. of a tan solid; m.p. 
153-154°, with preliminary softening. Several recrystalliza­
tions from hot benzene afforded 500 mg. of colorless prismatic 
needles, m.p. 183-184°. This product gave a positive red 
spot test for an aliphatic oxime group when heated on a 
steam bath with benzoyl peroxide and the vapors were 
allowed to impinge on a filter paper which had been treated 
previously with equal parts of 1% solution of a-naphthyl-

This paper reports the synthesis of a series of a-alkyltryptophans and tryptamines in which the indole nucleus may be 
substituted in the 5-position. The tryptophans were prepared by condensation of the appropriate gramme with ethyl a - 
nitropropionate followed by reduction and saponification. The tryptamines were prepared by four procedures: a) decar­
boxylation of the above nitroester followed by reduction of the nitro groups; b) alkylation of a nitroparaffin with a gramme 
or c) with an indole-3-carboxaldehyde, followed by reduction; d) treatment of tryptophan with an appropriate alkanoic 
anhydride followed by Wolff-Kishner reduction of the resulting acylaminoketone.
During the past few years many reports have been 
published concerning the formation1  and metab­
olism1 '2  of serotonin as well as its possible role in 
such conditions as mental disease,3  hypertension,4  
inflammatory' processes5  and gastrointestinal func­
tion.6  7  Woolley3 b  has suggested that mental aber­
ration might be due to lack of serotonin in the brain, 
and has reported7 8 -  that increasing brain serotonin 
by the administration of its precursor, 5-hydroxy- 
trvptophan, resulted in clinical improvement in 
cases of schizophrenia. Shore7 b  has demonstrated 
that iproniazide, a monaminoxidase inhibitor, 
in c re a se s  serotonin brain levels by preventing its 
metabolism and Udenfriend8  suggested that aniin- 
oxidase inhibitors, active i n  vivo,  should be po­
tentially useful in treating mental disease. Num­
erous reports on the use of iproniazide and other 
monaminoxidase inhibitors in depressive states 
have since appeared.9

(1959).On the other hand, three Rauwolfia alkaloids—  
reserpine, deserpidine and rescinnamine—also 
used in mental disease, decrease  serotonin in the 
brain1 0  *  1 1  1 2  *  *  *  *  1 7  and at least the first of these produces a 
decrease in both brain and peripheral norepineph­
rine and epinephrine.1 1  Attempts to rationalize 
these facts have been made,1 2  but from the con­
flicting data available it is impossible to predict 
the ultimate effect of an increased serotonin brain 
level. Indeed it is possible that both stimulation 
and depression could result depending on the dose 
of aminoxidase inhibitor administered or the brain 
serotonin level achieved.1 2 0
In the course of a continuing study of the bio­
logical effects of various types of indole-containing 
compounds we undertook the preparation of a 
series of a-alkyltrypt amines and tryptophans. 
Such tryptamines could conceivably act as sero­
tonin-like compounds or as true serotonin antago­
nists in a manner similar to Woolley’s BAS.1 3  
On 'he other hand they could act as competitive 
inhibitors of monamine oxidase and hence in­
crease levels of serotonin and perhaps other 
physiologically' active amines. The corresponding 
a-alxyltrypt opiums might represent potential 
sources of these tryptamines in the brain by acting 
as precursors capable of crossing the blood-brain 
barrier. This situation would resemble the case of
5-hyrdroxytryptophan,la which enters the brain 
and is converted to serotonin which itself does not 
cross into the brain. On the other hand the trypto­
phans could act as 5-hy'droxvtry'ptophar. decar­
boxylase inhibitors and thus decrease brain serotonin 
love s. In any event a study of the effects of these 
two classes of compounds would appear fruitful.
The tryptophans and tryptamines which we pre­
pared are of the general types I and II.

For the preparation of a-rne thy I  tryptophans 
(I H'" = CII,) we chose the general method, 
outlined in Fig. 1 , involving interaction of the ap­
propriately substituted gramine with ethyl a - 
nitropropionate following the published method 
used for tryptophan itself.1 4  In the present case, 
however, the problem of dialkylation is eliminated 
by the presence of only one a lp h a  hydrogen atom

pared by methylation of VI using methyl iodide in 
the presence of sodium hydride.
a-Methvlt ryptophan, prepared previously1 5  from
3-indoleacetone via the hydantoin, was produced 
in good yield through the nitropropionate. 5- 
Hydroxytryptophan itself1 6  was obtained using the 
ethyl nitromalonate method of Weisblat and 
Lvttle.1 7
The tryptamines were prepared by four pro­
cedures, depending on the substituents present. 
The first method involved decarboxylation of the 
appropriate a-nitroester followed by reduction of 
the resulting nitroalkane by means of lithium

aluminum hydride (Fig. 1). According to the second 
method alkylation of 2-nitropropane with 5-benzyl- 
oxygramine to give IX  occurred readily. In those 
cases in which the nitroparaffin contained two 
a l p h a  hydrogen atoms dialkylation resulted, in 
agreement with the experience of Snyder and K atz1 8  
with gramine itself. The third procedure involved 
alkylation of the nitroparaffin with the appropriate 
indole 3-carboxaldehyde as outlined in Figure 
2.1 9  2 0  Compound X X IX  was also prepared from tryp­
tophan using the Dakin-West reaction2 2  followed 
by Wolff-Kishner reduction of the resulting 1- 
(3'-indolyl)-2-acetamido-butanone-3. The same 
method was also used to prepare a-n-propyltryp- 
t amine.
The preparation of two of Tie substituted 
gramine intermediates required somewhat lengthy 
procedures. 5-Benzyloxy-l-methylgramine (IV) was 
prepared v i a 5-benzyloxyindole-3-earboxaldehyde, 
which, by virtue of the blocking group in the 3- 
position, could be methylated on the indole nitro­
gen using potassium carbonate as the base to 
yield X X III. The blocking group was then elimi­
nated by oxidation to the corresponding indole-
3-earboxvlic acid, followed by decarboxylation 
to 5-benzyloxy-l-methylindole, which was con­
verted to the gramine in the usual way. In the 
synthesis of 5-benzyloxy-2-methylgramine, V, ben- 
zoquinone was condensed with ethyl /3-aminocroto- 
nate according to the method of Nenitzescu2 3  
to yield ethyl 5-hydroxy-2-methylindole-3-carboxyl- 
ate. The latter was then converted to the cor­
responding 5-benzyloxy derivative, decarboxylated, 
and treated with formaldehyde and dimethylamine 
to yield V.
Two methods for the preparation of nitro- 
alkenes X X IV  to X X V II were available from the 
literature. The first method was reported by Ma- 
jima and Kotake2 4  in which l-acetylindole-3- 
carboxaldehyde, nitromethane, and sodium hy­
droxide were used. The second method was re­
ported by Seka2 5  in which 2-methylindole-?- 
aldehyde, mcthylamine hydrochloride and sodium 
carbonate were employed. Neither of these methods 
was satisfactory, as the former did not afford a

(10) After the completion of our work Young5 "  and Ash 
and Wragg 2 1 reported the prepara "don of XX by reaction of 
the indolealdehyde and nitroethane, followed by reduction. 
Our overall yield via the nitroester was approximately twice 
that reported 2 1 by the latter authors. These authors also de­
scribe the synthesis of XXVIII and XXIX by the procedure 
used in this paper, but few experimental details are given.

and the latter was time-consuming and resulted in 
low yields.
Investigation of this problem disclosed that a 
satisfactory method for the preparation of these 
nitroalkenes was the reaction between the nitro- 
alkane and indole-3-carboxaldehyde in the presence 
of acetic acid, ammonium acetate, and sodium 
acetate. This method was applicable to the prepa­
ration of both the 1-substituted and 1-unsubstituted 
indole nitroalkenes.
During the course of this work it became appar­
ent that the structure of the reaction products 
was not represented by X X X III. The absence of 
absorption bands corresponding to the nitro group 
in the infrared and the appearance of a new band 
at 1270 and 1223 cm.-1, correlated with ultraviolet 
absorption in the 400 mp region, strongly suggested 
that the compounds were actually inner nitronium 
salts as shown by formula XXIV. These compounds 
could be converted to the corresponding amines 
catalytically but were preferably reduced with 
lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran.

P h a r m a c o l o g y .  Some of the pharmacological 
testing carried out with certain of our compounds 
has already been published. Govier, Howes, and 
Gibbons2 6  studied the action of monamine oxidase 
on G-ethyltryptamine (XXIX) i n  v i t r o  and con­
cluded that deamination did not occur. Barlow and 
Khan2 7  have described the effects of 5-ber.zyloxy- 
a-methyltryptamine (XIX), 5-hydroxy-«-met hvl- 
trypuarnine (XX), and a-methyltryptamine (XXX) 
on the isolated rat uterus and isolated rat fundus

have published the i n  v i t r o  and i n  v i v o  effects of
5-hydroxy-a-methyltryptamine (XX), «-methyl- 
trvpr  amine (XXVIII), and «-ethyltryptamine 
(X X IX )2 8 1 ’ in blocking the enzymes, monamine 
oxidase, and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase. 
The first two compounds are potent inhibitors of 
both enzymes i n  v i t r o  while the third compound is 
much more selective in favor of monamine oxidase.

XXIX inhibits only monamine oxidase while 
XXVIII blocks both enzyme systems. Substitution 
of methyl groups in the 1- or 2-position of the in­
dole ring decreases inhibitory activity somewhat. 
This effect of substitution in the indole ring is 
similarly apparent in the ability of 5-hydroxy-a- 
methyltryptophan (XV), 5-hydroxy-1-a-dimethyl- 
tryptophan (XVI), and 5-hydroxy-2,a-dimethyl- 
tryptophan (XVII) to block 5-hydroxytryptophan 
decarboxylase. Compound XV is a potent selective 
inhibitor of this enzyme, both i n  vitro  and i n  vivo  
but, in rats at least, does not appear to be orally 
absorbed. This is somewhat surprising in view of 
its amino acid structure and the fact that that 5- 
hydroxytryptophan itself has been found by Dr. 
Greig to be orally active. Many factors, such as 
relative effects on various enzyme systems, rela­
tive effects on each enzyme system in brain vs. 
liver, relative toxicities, and other pharmacological 
effects, play a major role in the overall biological 
profile of even such a closely knit group of com­
pounds as those reported in this paper.

fluxed for 3.5 hr. while a rapid stream of nitrogen was passed 
through the solution.
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and 
100 ml. of chloroform was added. The ice cold mixture was 
then washed with two portions of 10% hydrochloric acid 
(30 ml. each), once with 30 ml. of water, and then with twro 
portions of 5% potassium hydroxide (30 ml. each). The 
organic layer was washed once with water (30 ml.), once with 
saturated salt solution, then dried over sodium sulfate and 
evaporated to dryness. A brown oil (II) was obtained, 12.8 
g. (97% yield). The infrared spectrum was very similar to 
that of the sample which was purified by chromatography as 
described below.
(2) Sixty-six grams (0.236 mole) of 5-benzyloxvgramine,
34.7 g. (0.236 mole) of ethyl-a-nitropropionate, and 235 ml. 
of dry xylene were placed in a 500 ml., three necked flask 
fitted with a stirrer, an efficient condenser, and a nitrogen 
inlet tube. The mixture was heated with stirring under re­
flux with a vigorous stream of nitrogen passing through to 
remove dimethylamine as it was formed. After 10 hr. di- 
methylamine evolution had practically stopped. The solu­
tion was cooled and washed with 2N hydrochloric acid, 2.V  
sodium hydroxide, then water. It was dried over magnesium 
sulfate, decolorized with 10 g. of Magnesol, filtered, and the 
filtrate was concentrated i n  vacuo.  The reddish-orange oil 
weighed 78.3 g. (90.0%). Fifteen grams was chromato­
graphed over 1  kg. of Florisil. The oil was put on the column 
in benzene solution and the column was developed with 21. 
of 5% acetone in petroleum ether (b.p. 60-71°), 2 1 . of 7.5% 
acetone in petroleum ether (b.p. 60-71°), and finally with 
five 3-1. portions of 10% acetone in petroleum ether (b.p 
60-71°). The first 12 1 . of 10% eluate gave, on concentration,
12.5 g. of clear, light vellow oil. Infrared: NH: 3425; C = 0 -

The remainder of the crude material was purified and de­
colorized by dissolving it in methylene chloride and treating 
it with 40 g. of Florisil. filtering and treating again with 30 
g. After the solvent was evaporated, 36.4 g. of clear, light

was fdtered and washed very slowly with 3.0 ml. of water. 
The slightly wet, solid was transferred to a flask and mixed 
with acetone. The mixture was warmed on the steam bath 
and warm water added until the solution became clear. 
Warm acetone was then added dropwise until precipitation 
occurred (volume ratio ca. 10:1 acetone-water). The mix­
ture was cooled in an ice bath and filtered. The white lus­

The crude sodium salt was dissolved in 1 1 . of water by 
warming to 40°. The solution was cooled to about 7° and 
acidified with 25 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid while cooling. 
The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with 100 
ml. of water, sucked dry, and transferred to a beaker. This 
filtration and drying sh o u ld  not  take more than 20 min., as 
the solid starts turning oily after standing for a short time. 
The solid was allowed to stand at room temperature for 56 
hr. The resulting product was dissolved in 150 ml. of ether, 
dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated. The oily 
product (XV III) weighed 7.5 g. and showed a small amount 
of carbonyl impurity at 1696 cm . -1 (probably resulting from 
a side Nef-reaction).

colloidal, giving the solution a dark appearance which did not 
lighten on addition of a little sodium hydrosulfite. The alco­
hol was removed by concentration under vacuum. An equal 
volume of hot water was added and the dark solution was 
forced through a Seitz sterilizing filter under nitrogen pres­
sure. Some black material was removed, but the solution 
was still dark. It was concentrated under slight vacuum un­
til crystallization began. The mixture was chilled at 4° over­
night, then the greyish-tan crystals were collected and 
washed with a little cold water; 17.8 g. The filtrate, to which 
a little sodium hydrosulfite had been added, was concen­

ethyl-u-nitropropionate (29.42 g., 0.2 mole), and 200 ml. of 
dry toluene were placed in a 500 ml., three necked flask fitted 
with stirrer, nitrogen inlet tube, and an efficient condenser. 
The mixture was heated for 10 hr. under reflux with stirring 
and vigorous nitrogen flow - to sweep out dimethylamine. 
The amber solution was cooled and washed with two 50-ml. 
portions of 2.Y hydrochloric acid, 100 ml. of water, two 50- 
ml. portions of l.Y sodium hydroxide, then with two 50-ml. 
portions of water. The toluene solution was dried over an­hydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed 
under vacuum. An oil (51.0 g., 91.8%) remained. It was 
used directly for the reduction-hydrolysis steps.
b. a - M c lh y llr y p to p h a n .  Ethyl a-nitro-a:-methyl-/5-(3-in-

ring autoclave with 400 ml. of 3-A alcohol and 12.0 g. of 
fresh, brown platinum oxide. Reduction was carried out at 
30° under 40-50 p.s.i. hydrogen pressure. Reduction went 
smoothly and the calculated amount of hydrogen was ab­
sorbed. The autoclave was purged with nitrogen, opened, 
and 80 g. of 20% sodium hydroxide was added. Hydrolysis 
was accomplished by heating at 40° under hydrogen for 16 
hr. The catalyst was removed by filtration and was washed 
with water. Glacial acetic acid (25 ml.) was added to the 
combined filtrate and washes. The solution was concentrated 
in  vacuo  leaving a mixture of gum and some crystals. This 
was heated with about 300 ml. of absolute alcohol and then 
allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. Crystals 
were collected and washed with alcohol (8.47 g.). These were 
identified by infrared as sodium acetate. A second crop of 
sodium acetate was obtained after concentrating the mother 
liquor (8.1 g.). The solvent was removed from the filtrate in 
vacuo  leaving a gum which resisted all attempts to induce 
crystallization. After it had stood for about 9 months, it had 
largely crystallized. A small amount was removed for seed, 
then the remainder was dissolved in 450 ml. of hot water. 
The hot solution was treated with charcoal, and an equal 
volume of acetone was added to the filtrate. After seeding, 
crystals slowly formed and after 4 days at 4° the crystals 
were collected and washed with water-acetone ( 1:1) to give
28.3 g. of the monohvdrate; m.p. 178-194°. This material 
was recrystallized from a minimum of hot water to give
17.57 g. of needles, m.p. 198-203° (lit .,1 5 m.p. 203-205°).

gramine 2 9 (28.0 g., 0.1 mole), ethyl nitromalonate (20.52 g., 
0.1 mole), and 225 ml. of dry toluene were placed in a 300 
ml., three necked flask fitted with stirrer, nitrogen inlet tube 
and an efficient spiral tube condenser. The mixture was 
heated under reflux with stirring and with a vigorous stream 
of nitrogen passing through. When the materials were first 
mixed, a solution was obtained, but after heating was started 
a solid formed which made stirring difficult. As stirring and 
heating were continued, the solid disappeared. The solid is 
undoubtedly the salt of 5-benzyloxygramine and ethyl 
nitromalonate which decomposes to dimethylamine and the 
alkylated nitroester. The solution was heated until no more 
dimethylamine was evolved (about 4 hr.). The cool solution 
was washed twice with 100 ml. of 2.Y hydrochloric acid, 
twice with 100 ml. of lAr sodium hydroxide and twice with 
water. It was then dried with magnesium sulfate and par­
tially decolorized with Magnesol. The clear solution obtained 
by filtration contained the ethyl <*-nitro-a-carbethoxy-/3[3- 
(5-benzyloxyindole)]propionate and was used directly for 
decarbethoxylation to the compound described below.

solution of 2.3 g. (0.1 g.-atom) of sodium in 100 ml. of ab­
solute alcohol was slowly added to the toluene solution 
above, while cooling in ice and stirring. When about 25 ml. 
of the alcohol solution had been added, a very thick pre­
cipitate formed which made stirring difficult. It was neces­
sary to add 100 ml. of anhydrous ether in order to obtain a 
fluid slurry. The remainder of the alcohol solution was then 
added over 1.5 hr. and the slurry was stirred at room tem­
perature overnight. The solid was collected and washed with 
ether, then placed in a separatory funnel with 200 ml. of 
ether and 75 ml. of 2Ar hydrochloric acid. The mixture was 
shaken until all of the solid disappeared. The ether layer

was washed twice with 50-ml. portions of 2N hydrochloric 
acid and then with water. It was dried over magnesium sul­
fate, treated with some Magnesol to remove color and, con­
centrated in vacuo  to give the 5-benzyloxy nitroester as a red 
oil. The infrared spectrum of this material contained the ex­
pected absorptions.
c. 5-Benzyloiytryptophan.  Ethyl c-nitro-/3[3-(5-benzyl- 
oxyindole)]propionate (3.7 g., 0.01 mole] in 50 ml. of abso­
lute alcohol was hydrogenated at 40 p.s.i of hydrogen using
1.0 g. of platinum oxide catalyst. Uptake of hydrogen 
ceased after 1.75 hr. After carefully purging with nitrogen, 
the bottle was opened and 4.0 g. of a 20% (by weight) solu­
tion of sodium hydroxide was added. A hydrogen atmosphere 
was re-established in the bottle and hydrolysis was allowed 
to proceed at room temperature overnight. It is very im­
portant to exclude air; otherwise, the solution darkens rapidly 
and purification of the product is difficult. Twenty milliliters 
of water was added and the catalyst was removed by filtra­
tion. The pH of the filtrate was adjusted to 6 with glacial 
acetic acid whereupon a gelatinous solid formed. On heat­
ing it gradually changed to solid material. The mixture was 
cooled and the solid w ras collected and washed with water to 
give 2.64 g. of 5-benzyloxy tryptophan. The compound is 
amphoteric and can be partially purified by dissolving in 
either acid or base, treating with charcoal and then adjust­
ing the pH to 6. A small amount was purified in this manner 
and then crystallized from water containing a little alcohol;

d. 5-Hydroxyiryptophan.  5-Benzyloxytryptophan (3.42 g.) 
was suspended in 50 ml. of alcohol and 50 ml. of water with
1.0 g. of 10% palladium-on-charcoal and hydrogenated at 10 
p.s.i. Reduction was rapid and complete. The catalyst was 
removed by filtration, but the fdtrate was dark because ofthe presence of colloidal catalyst. The fdtrate was concen­
trate! to a small volume under vacuum and the resulting 
dark crystals were dissolved in water. The hot solution was 
filtered and allowed to crystallize. The crystalline material 
was still dark; therefore it was recrystallized from water, us­
ing a Seitz filter to remove the colloidal catalyst; white crys­
tals were obtained (1.23 g.). A  second crop was obtained by 
concentrating the mother liquor (0.29 g.). Total weight,

Received June 4, 1959
Papain catalysis provides a means for acylating the amino group of substituted anilines containing an alcoholic hydroxyl 
without concurrent acylation of the alcoholic hydroxyl. These substituted anilines can be employed for resolution of certain 
A T -acylamino acids like carbobenzoxy-DL-alanine, with papain as the catalyst and resolving agent. When the asymmetric 
center is shifted to the substituted aniline, as with m-(l-hydroxyethyl)aniline in its reaction Math non-asymmetric hippurie 
acid, papain does not cause a resolution to take place, but a racemic product is formed in good yield instead. Reduction of 
m-aminoacetophenone to racemic m-(l-hydroxyethyl)aniline has been found to occur in good yield by means of lithium 
aluminum hydride. The optimum pH fer the papain-catalyzed reaction between »¡-(l-hydroxyethvl)aniline and hippurie 
acid is about 4.7 for the experimental conditions employed.

behavior of A'-acylamino acids toward substituted 
anilines containing a hydroxyalkyl substituent.
There are at least three significant reasons for 
such an investigation. First, this provides a proce­
dure for acvlating an amino group, without subject­
ing an alcoholic hydroxyl radical to concurrent 
acylation. Second, it is of interest to ascertain the 
ability of (hydroxyalkyl)anilines to bring about res­
olutions of racemic iV-acylamino acids under the 
asymmetric influence of papain. Resolutions do not 
always occur 5 in reactions between racemic -Y-aeyl- 
amino acids and aniline when papain is employed as 
the catalyst and resolving agent. Third, it is of par­
ticular value to shift the asymmetric center from 
the amino acid moiety to the substituted aniline 
moiety during the formation of the substituted ani­
lide.
The substituted anilines ultimately chosen for in­
vestigation were o-aminobenzyl alcohol, wi-amino-  
benzyl alcohol, p-(2-hydroxyethyl)aniline, and ?n-(l-  hydroxylethyl)aniline. Ar-Acylamino acids selected  
were these relatively soluble ones: hippuric acid,  benzoyl-DL-alanine, benzoyl-L-alanine, carbobenz-  
oxy-DL-alanine, and carbobenzoxy-L-alanine.
m-(l-Hydroxyethyl)aniline contains an asymme­
tric center at the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl. 
Its behavior toward hippuric acid is significant be­
cause no asymmetric center exists in hippuric acid.

The dependence of yield on 71H for this reaction was 
determined, as shown in Fig. 1. As a consequence, 
all subsequent reactions were conveniently carried 
out at a pH of about 4.7, reasonably close to this op­
timum.

none, practical grade from Eastman Organic Chemicals, was 
dissolved in a minimum amount of boiling water, treated 
with carbon black, filtered hot, and the solution was sepa­
rated from a small amount of insoluble oily substance. Then 
the solution was evaporated to about one third of its original 
volume and cooled overnight in a refrigerator. The light 
yellow solid was removed by filtration and dried first in the 
atmosphere and subsequently over phosphorus pentoxide. 
This dried m-aminoaeetephenone was used for reduction 
with lithium aluminum hydride.
Lithium aluminum hydride (10 g.) was weighed rapidly' 
on glazed paper and added to a three-neck flask swept free of 
atmospheric gases by means of a continuous flow of dry 
nitrogen. Then 13.52 g. of powdered m-aminoacetophenone 
was partly dissolved in £00 ml. of absolute ether and the 
slurry' was added dropwise over a period of 2 hr., with vigor­
ous stirring, to the lithium aluminum hydride. The mixture 
was stirred for two more hours and allowed to stand over­
night. Cautious addition of about 100 ml. of water was fol­
lowed by addition of 250 ml. of 15% sodium hydroxide solu­
tion. The mixture was stirred for 2 hr. and the ether solution 
was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with two 
300-ml. jrortions of ether and the combined ether solutions 
were filtered and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. 
Then the ether solution was stirred with decolorizing car­
bon, filtered three times, and evaporated to dry'noss-  The 
residue consisted of 11.0 g. (81% yield) of m -( 1-hydroxy- 
ethyl )aniline, a cream colored product, m.p. 70-71°.

tion mixtures was set up using o-aminobenzyl alcohol with 
acylated amino acids in the usual way. No evidence was 
given that any papain-catalyzed reactions had occurred. 
The considerable insolubility of the o-aminobenzyl alcohol 
appeared to be a major factor in the failure of the reactions 
to take place.

It was necessary to purify crude p-(2-hvdroxyethyl)aniline

The mechanism of these papain-catalyzed reac­

mechanism suggested for the hydrolysis of amide

should be approximately the same as the one pro­
posed for the papain-catalyzed synthesis of X a, X e-

I t  is possible that the t o - ( 1-hydroxyethyl) radical 
is too far removed from the ammo group on the 
benzene ring to create any stereospecificity at the 
moment reaction occurs with the active complex 
formed between the enzyme and the jV-acylamino 
acid. I t  should be recalled, nevertheless, that the 
asymmetric center of acetyl-DL-phenylalanylgly- 
cine is considerably removed from the free carboxyl 
group, which contacts sulfur at the active center of

2-Acetonaphthoxime reacted with carbon monoxide and hydrogen at. a pressure of about 4000 p.s.i. and at a temperature 
of about 220° in the presence of preformed dicobalt octacarbonyl as catalyst to yield 2-(/3-napht.hyl)-4-methylbenzo[h]quino­
line, racemic l-( 3-naphthyl)ethylurea, and 3-methylbenzo[f|phthalimidine. Crystalline hydrochloride, methiodide, picrate 
and aldehyde derivatives of 2-(/S-naphthyl)-4-methylbenzo[h] quinoline were obtained. The infrared and ultraviolet spectra 
of the aforementioned compounds are described.
This paper is concerned with an extension of 
our previous study1 '2  of the reaction of carbon 
monoxide with aromatic ketoximes. In particular, 
it deals with the reaction of 2-acetonaphthoxime 
with a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen 
(98.5:1.5) at a pressure of about 4000 p.s.i. and at 
a temperature of about 220° in the presence of 
preformed dicobalt octacarbonyl as catalyst.
Whereas the expected cyclization reaction took 
place only to the extent of about 10% yielding 
product III, the main reaction was a condensation 
one resulting in the formation of 2-(/t-naphthyI)-
4-methylbenzo[h]quinoline(I) and racemic l-(/3- 
naphthyl)ethylurea(II).
Producís I and II were easily isolated from the 
reaction mixture by fractional crystallization. 
1  -(/t-iiaph t hy!)et-hyl urea was slightly soluble in 
benzene or chloroform, whereas 2-(/3-naphthyl)-4- 
methylbenzo[h]quinoline came down as the second 
product using ethanol as solvent. Direct chroma­

alumina using benzene-petroleum ether as de-

veloper proved to ho the best way to isolate product 
I (highly fluorescent) in pure form.
The empirical formula of compound 1  was C2 4- 
H2 :N. Infrared analyses showed no NH stretching 
band. As compound I could not be reduced with 
magnesium in methanol it was assumed that the 
C=N—group must be part of an aromatic system. 
On the basis that compound I failed to react with 
maleic anhydride the linear benzoquinoline struc­
ture was eliminated.3  A peak at 362 m/i in the ultra­
violet spectrum of I suggested that the nucleus of

the compound contained the angular benzoquinoline 
structure.3  Further support for the tentative assign­
ment of a benzoquinoline nucleus was provided by 
the inertness of compound I towards prolonged 
heating with molten sodium hydroxide or with 
boiling concentrated hydrochloric acid. Selenium 
dioxide oxidation of I gave an aldehyde (V) indi­
cating the presence of an active methyl group. 
Further controlled oxidation of the aldehyde with 
potassium permanganate in acetone at room tem­
perature or with silver oxide in ethanol gave a 
carboxylic acid (VI) having a melting point of 
248-250°. The reported4  melting point of 2-(/3- 
naphthyl)benzo[h]quinoline-4-carboxylic acid is 
227-228°. As the melting point of compound VI 
was in question, although its solubility character­
istics were similar to that of the reported carboxylic 
acid,4  2-(/3-naphthyl)-benzo[h]quinoline-4-carbox- 
ylic acid, the latter compound was synthesized by 
the condensation of a-naphthisatin with 2-aceto- 
naphthone.4  Purification of the acid was achieved 
by the method of Robinson and Bogert.5  This 
purified carboxylic acid had an identical melting 
point with that of compound VI. Furthermore, a 
mixed melting point of compound VI and the 
authentic sample showed no depression. Thus, 
compound I was proven to be 2-(/3-naphthyl)-4- 
methylbenzo[h]quinoline and the aldehyde (V) 
must be 2 - (/3  - naphthyl) - benzo[h]quinoline - 4- 
carboxaldehyde.
It is possible that the discrepancy in the melting 
point exhibited by compound VI and that re­
ported in the literature of 2-(/3-naphthyl)-benzo- 
[h]quinoline-4-carboxylic acid might have been due 
to the use of a different method of purification.
Reaction of 2-(/3-naphthyl)-4-methvlbenzo[h]- 
quinoline with gaseous hydrogen chloride in ether 
gave a yellow salt having a green fluorescence. 
Conversion of the base into the salt caused a batho- 
chromic shift of about 30 m /z in the ultraviolet

65 (1936).spectrum. On being heated, the salt decomposed 
slowly at 90-100° reforming the parent base. 
Titration of the salt in alcohol with standard potas­
sium hydroxide gave a molecular weight of 314.
A crystalline methiodide salt was formed by 
prolonged heating of the base (I) with methyl iodide 
at 100°. Addition of picric acid in ethanol to the 
base immediately yielded the picrate.
Compound II was proven to be racemic l-(/3- 
naphthyl)ethylurea by direct comparison with an 
authentic sample6  prepared by the condensation 
of 1-(/3-naphthyl)ethylamine with urea. It is in­
teresting to note that four of the bands (3435, 
3350, 3230, and 1648 cm.-1) in the infrared spec­
trum of compound II are similar to those of a 
monosubstituted urea.7 - 8
After compounds I and II were separated from 
the reaction mixture, the remaining residue when 
chromatographed on alumina using benzene-i- 
butyl alcohol as developer yielded impure com­
pounds III and IV. Subsequent rechromatographic 
purification of III and IV on alumina using ben­
zene-ethyl acetate as developer essentially freed 
compound III of impurities but failed to give an 
analytically pure sample of IV. Fractional crystal­
lization of IV was unsuccessful, giving very low 
yields of a compound having a wide melting 
range.
On the bases of chemical and infrared analyses2 '9  
(NH stretching at 3310 and lactam at 1690 cm.-1), 
fraction III was assumed to be 3-methylbenzo-
[f]phthalimidine. Elemental analyses gave an 
empirical formula consistent with structure III. 
Support for the formation of the linear rather than 
an angular benzo[h]phthalimidine was deduced 
from the work of Murahashi1 0  who found that 2- 
naphthaldehyde anil cyclized under similar condi­
tions to yield the linear isomer.
On the bases of chemical and infrared analyses 
bands [at 3300, 1625, 1596 (sh), 1578 (sh), and 1562 
cm.-1], we suggest that compound IV is probably 
s Zy»i-di-l-(fl-naph thy 1 )  ethyl urea formed by the 
condensation of l-(/3-naphthyl)ethylurea. Such con­
densations which are readily brought about by 
heating monosubstituted ureas are well known 
in the literature.1 1  The similarity of the infrared 
spectra of IV with that of si/m-dibenzylurea 
(3337, 1625, 1591, and 1575 cm.-1) supports our 
assignment of structure IV.

high pressure bomb was introduced 100 ml. of thiophene- 
free anhydrous benzene, 2-acetonaphthcxime (15 g., 0.08 
mole), and dicobalt octacarbonyl (10 g., 0.03 mole). The 
reactor was then closed and connected to a high pressure 
source (2140 p.s.i.) of mixed gas consisting of 98.5% carbon 
monoxide and 1.5% hydrogen. The bomb was rocked and 
heated at 210-235° for 50 min. After the vessel was cooled 
the pressure was 1950 p.s.i. Subsequent decomposition of the 
dicobalt octacarbonyl at 70-80° was folio.ved by removal of 
the benzene under reduced pressure. Extraction of the 
residual wax with hot chloroform (Xorit,) gave a green solu­
tion which, upon evaporation, gave a brown wax; yield,
13.8 g. Crystallization of the wax from 100 ml. of chloro­
form at —15° for 1  day yielded product II (1.1 g., 8%) of 
white crystalline material having a melting point range of 
170-205°. Essentially the same material could be obtained 
by partial crystallization of the product from benzene. 
Evaporation of the solvent left a residue which could be 
crystallized from ethanol yielding I.
A portion of the above residue (7.8 g.) was dissolved in 15 
ml. of benzene and added to the top of a glass column con­
taining a 150 X 70 mm. (diam.) adsorbent column of 
alumina. The following mixtures of developer were then 
added consecutively with the results as indicated. ( 1) 80 ml. 
of benzene-petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°I  (1:1 A :  V) gave 
0.10 g. of a sirup (showed no carbonyl in the infrared and did 
not fluoresce). (2 ) 700 ml. of the above developer yielded 
3.15 g. (41%) of fluorescent I. (3) 500 ml. of same developer 
eluted a second fluorescent zone (0.23 g. u  (4) 1000 ml. of 
benzene eluted 0.14 g. of nonfluorescent material. (5) 1750 
ml. of benzene-f-butyl alcohol (98:2) eluted 2.30 g. of a mix­
ture of III and IV. ( 6) 350 ml. of benzene-f-butyl alcohol 
(98:2) yielded 0.23 g. of III (compounds III and IV were dif­
ficult to separate with benzene-alcohol) (7) 450 ml. of 
benzene-ethanol (1:1) eluted 1.02 g. (13%) of material 
which was proved to be identical to compound II.
Compounds III and IV were rechrcmatographed on 
alumina using benzene-ethyl acetate ( 1:1) as developer. 
Compound IV had a faster rate of elution than compound
III.

The synthesis of a series of new 5,6-dialkyl-2,3-dihydropsoralenes is described along with the dehydrogenation of these 
derivatives to the corresponding psoralenes. A compound which may be the 6-coumaranyl ester of 2,3-dihydro-5-carboxy- 
psoralene was prepared. This compound was dehydrogenated and also converted to the free acid. The free acid was also 
synthesized directly by a Pechmann type reaction. This acid was simultaneously decarboxylated and dehydrogenated to 
psoralene. An isomer of xanthotoxin, 5-methoxypsoralene, was prepared from the corresponding 2,3-dihydro derivative. 5- 
Acetoxypsoralene was prepared; this compound was stable toward dehydrogenation in contrast to 5-hydroxypsoralene 
which has been reported to decompose under dehydrogenation operations. The synthesis of a number of coumarin deriva­
tives which might serve as intermediates for the preparation of psoralenes was accomplished. Extensive attempts to cyclize 
two of these intermediates, 7-(2-oxoethoxy)-4-methylcoumarin and 7-(2-bromoethoxy)-4-methylcoumarin, were unsuccess­
ful. In several of the cyclization experiments where a pure product was isolated it was found that ether cleavage to 4-methyl- 
umbelliferone rather than ring closure had taken place.
In recent years the furocoumarin xanthotoxin 
has received considerable attention, both in the 
scientific literature2  and the popular press. As 
xanthotoxin (9-methoxypsoralene) is obtained from 
natural sources and the number of known psora­
lenes are limited, it was worthwhile to investigate 
the procedures for the synthesis of these potential 
drugs as well as to prepare a number of new 
psoralenes for research purposes.
The starting material for the synthesis of 
psoralene compounds is resorcinol or its 2- or 5-

The earliest work was that of Spath,3  who in a 
one step operation condensed malic acid with 6- 
hydroxycoumaran in a sulfuric acid medium to 
yield 2,3-dihydropsoralene IV from which psora­
lene III was obtained by dehydrogenation (see 
Fig. 2). Later Horning and Reisner4  5  made this ap-
Fig. 2. Synthesis of psoralene from 6-hydroxycoumaran
proach more attractive by devising an improved 
synthesis of the key intermediate 6-hydroxy- 
coumaran. Furthermore, these workers found that
6-acetoxycoumaran (an intermediate for the prepa­
ration of 6-hydroxycoumaran) could be used di­
rectly for the synthesis of the 5-substituted 2,3- 
dihydropsoralenes and by condensing it with a 
variety of /3-ketoesters, they obtained a series of 5- 
substituted 2,3-dihydropsoralenes.
Robinson, et a l,s  also using 6-hydroxycoumaran 
as the key intermediate devised an alternate route 
for the synthesis of psoralene. This group formyl- 
ated I in the 5-position and then condensed the 
product V with cyanoacetic acid to yield a psoralene 
compound (see Fig. 2). The resulting 6-carboxy-
2,3-dihydropsoralene VI was then decarboxylated 
and dehydrogenated to yield psoralene itself.
Ray, et a l.6  have approached the problem of 
furocoumarin synthesis from the coumarin moiety 
of the psoralene molecule and repon the synthesis 
of 3-methylpsoralene. In this procedure 7-aceto- 
nyloxycoumarin, VIII, was prepared by treating 
umbelliferone with chloroacetone. Cyclization of 
this intermediate to IX was accomplished in an 
ethanolic medium using sodium ethoxide as the 
condensing agent; in this respect the ring closure 
was markedly different from the usual pattern (see 
Fig. 3).
An alternate route employing a coumarin inter­
mediate was devised by Rodighiero and Antonello7  
for the synthesis of xanthotoxin, IX. These workers 
converted 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin to the
6-formyl derivative which in turn was cyclized to

the psoralene using ethyl bromoacetate to effect 
ring closure. The four synthetic routes to the psora- 
lenes of which two are based on the use of umbel­
liferone and two on the use of 6-hydroxycoumaran 
arc illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.
Three of the routes (see Figs. 2 and 3 — the two 
employing formylation procedures and the third, 
the /3-ketoester condensation) are long and involved. 
On the other hand the fourth procedure, as reported 
by Ray,6  requires only three steps from resorcinol 
to a 3-substituted psoralene (see Fig. 3). This 
method is also attractive in that an umbelliferone 
is an intermediate rather than 6-hydroxycoumaran. 
Umbelliferones can be synthesized both easily and 
in some variety.8
The second step of Ray’s procedure simply in­
volves the coupling of an a-haloketone and an um­
belliferone (see Fig. 3) to form an ether v ia the 
Williamson procedure. The formation of the keto 
derivative proceeds smoothly; the ring closure, how­
ever, in our hands was not satisfactory giving at 
best only 4% yield (Ray did not report yield 
data for this step).
Even if ring closure were to proceed in good yield, 
Ray’s method is restrictive in that it yields 3- 
meth 3rlpsoralene (see VII, Fig. 3). To prepare the 
unsubstituted psoralene by the Ray procedure it 
would be necessary to start with 7-(2-oxoethoxy)- 
coumarin.
Although monochloroacetone reacted with um­
belliferone v ia a Williamson synthesis to yield the 
desired intermediate, chloroacetaldehyde would not 
react under similar conditions with 4-methylum- 
belliferone. For this reason the 7-(2-oxoethoxy)-4- 
methylcoumarin was prepared by oxidative pro­
cedures from both 7-(allyloxy)- and 7-(2,3-di- 
hydroxypropoxy) -4-methylcoumarin.
Cyclization experiments using 7-(2-oxoethoxy)-
4-methylcoumarin were undertaken using both 
acid and basic catalyst, all of which led to either
(1) recovery of starting material, (2) an unchar- 
acterizable tar, or (3) ether cleavage with the re­
covery of 4-methylumbelliferone. One experiment

using acetic anhydride with 48% hydrobromic acid  
yielded the acylal derivative of 7-(2-oxoethoxy)-
4-methylcoumarin. In connection with these ring  
closure studies both 7-bromoethoxy-4-methyl-  
coumarin and 7,8-di(2-oxoethoxy)^4-methylcou-  
marin were synthesized and their preparations are  
included herewith for purposes of documentation.
For this reason a new series of experiments were  
undertaken using 6-acetoxycoumaran as the in­
termediate and based on the procedures described  
by Horning and Reisner . 4 A series of 6-alkyl-2,3-  
dihydro-5-methylpsoralenes were prepared by con­
densing the appropriate a-alkyl-/3-ketoesters with
6-acetoxycoumaran. With the exception of 2,3-  
dihydro-5-methyl-6-myristylpsoralene, all of these  
compounds were dehydrogenated by refluxing in  
phenyl ether in the presence of 1 0% palladium  
on charcoal. Repeated and prolonged attempts to  
remove hydrogen from the myristyl derivative  
invariably resulted in the recovery of the unchanged  
starting material
In an attempt to prepare 5-carboxy-2,3-dihydro-  
psoralene, XI, the sodium salt of diethyl oxal-  
acetate was treated with 6-acetoxycoumaran in the  
presence of 75% sulfuric acid, following the usual  
procedure. For some unknown reason, all initial  
attempts were unsuccessful; a tarry product  
resulted, from, which no pure component could be  
isolated. However, as the authors became more ex­
perienced with the reaction, conditions were dis­
covered by which the condensation was successfully  
completed in a 75% sulfuric acid medium.
In the meantime, because of these initial failures  
and in view of the tarry nature of the reaction prod­
uct, the concentration of the sulfuric acid in the re­
action medium had been reduced to 60% in several  
of the experiments. The use of the more aqueous  
medium yielded a product having a sharp melting  
point which was not the desired compound. Carbon  
and hydrogen analysis indicated the empirical  
formula to be C 10H7O3. A molecular weight determi­
nation (Rast) showed the molecular formula to be  
C20H1 4O6.
An examination of the infrared spectrum of this  
compound revealed the presence of two carbonyl  
groups and the absence of either hydroxyl or carb­
oxylic acid substituents. Treatment of this product  
by the usual dehydrogenation procedures yielded  
a dehydrogenated product with a molecular formula  
C20H10O6, which indicated that the compound may  
have possessed two dihydrofuran ring systems.  
Furthermore, when CmHhOs was subjected to the  
aforementioned treatment in 75% sulfuric acid  
medium, the desired compound,  5-carboxy-2,3-  
dihydropsoralene, was isolated from the reaction  
mixture. Speculations based on this data indicated  
that the sequence of reactions responsible for  
these changes may be that shown in Fig. 4. How­
ever, experiments designed to confirm the hypo­
thesis that C 20H14O6 was the ester 6-coumaranylCOOH
Fig. 4. 5-Carboxy-2,3-dihydropsoraIene via the C 2oH1 40 6 , 
XII, compound
2,3-dihydropsoralene-5-carboxylate, XII, were in­
conclusive. Repeated attempts to saponify the  
compound under various conditions of basic hy­
drolysis were unsuccessful thus leaving the question  
of structure unsettled.
Horning and Reisner 9 have obtained psoralene  
by the simultaneous decarboxylation and dehydro­
genation of 6-carboxy-2,3-dihydropsoralene. Simi­
lar treatment of the 5-carboxy-2,3-dihydropsoralene  
prepared in this laboratory yielded the expected,  
unsubstituted psoralene.
5-Hydroxypsoralene was one of the psoralenes  
desired for research purposes by this laboratory.  
Horning and Reisner 9 had succeeded in preparing  
the 2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxypsoralene from a phloro-  
glucinol intermediate (in place of resorcinol— -  
see Fig. 1) but were unable to dehydrogenate the  
compound. In this laboratory the 2,3-dihydro-5-  
hydroxypsoralene was converted to both the 5- 
acetoxy- and 5-methoxy- derivatives and each  
subjected to dehydrogenation operations. The 5-  
acetoxy derivative was stable under the conditions  
of dehydrogenation, but the 5-methoxy derivative  
responded readily to yield one of the desired isomers  
of xanthotoxin.

7-(2,3-Dihydroxypropoxy)-4-methylcoumarin.  7-Allyloxy-4- 
methylcoumarin (4.32 g.) was dissolved in 75 ml. acetone. 
To this acetone solution was added, with rapid stirring, over 
a 10-min. period, a chilled solution of potassium permanga­
nate (2.1 g.) in water (400 ml.). An excess of ice was main­
tained in the reaction mixture during oxidation to assure a 
low reaction temperature. Upon completion of the per­
manganate addition, the stirring was continued for an addi­
tional 10 min. Sulfur dioxide was then bubbled into the 
brown mixture until all color had been discharged. Upon 
filtration of the mixture 2.2 g. of unchanged starting mate­
rial was recovered. The filtrate was concentrated to a volume 
of 150 ml. and then extracted with three 60-ml. portions 
of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate fractions were 
evaporated to dryness and the residue recrystallized from 
water; yield 1.3 g. (26%), m.p. 108-110°.

overnight. The product was then collected and washed with 
cold water. The dry, crude product was improved by wash­
ing with very small portions of ethyl ether. Decolorization 
with charcoal and recrystallization from ethanol gave 2.95

The synthesis of 6-methylthiopyrazolono(3,4-d)pyrimidines from 2-methylthio-4-chloro-5-carbethoxypyrimidine and 
hydrazines is described. When hydrazine, methylhydrazine, p-nitrophenylhydrazine, and 2,5-dichlorophenylhydrazine were 
used, intermediate 4-hydrazino-5-carbethoxypyrimidines were isolated. With 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, isopropylhydrazine, 
Phenylhydrazine, p-tolylhydrazine, p-halophenylhydrazines, and p-carboxyphenylhydrazine, the intermediate hydrazino- 
pyrimidines were not isolated.
Systems composed of fused pyrazole and pyrimi­
dine rings recently have received considerable  
attention as potential antagonists to natural  
purines. Robins6  reported the preparation of a num­
ber of 1,4-disubstituted and 1,4,6-trisubstituted  
pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidines by the action of form-  
amide or ureas on 1-substituted 4-cyano-5-amino-  
pyrazoles. Falco and Hitchings6  synthesized 4,6-  
dihydroxyptTazolo (3,4-d) pyrimidine by treating
4,5-pyrazoledicarboxamide with sodium hypo­
chlorite. Schmidt and Druey7  also prepared a  
number of 1,4,6-trisubstituted pyrazolo(3,4-d)-  
pyrimidines both by treating 2-substituted 3-  
amino-4-carbethoxypyrazoles with urea and sub­
stituted ureas and by the cyclization of 4-hydra-  
zino-5-pyrimidinecarbonitriles.
Relatively little work has been reported on  
systems with the pyrazolone and pyrimidine rings  
fused. Siewert8  described the synthesis of 2-phenyl-
5,7-dihydroxypyrazolono(4,3-d)pyrimidine by the  
action of potassium cyanate cn l-phenyl-3-  
carbethoxy-4-amino-5-pyrazolone. Taylor9  re­
ported the formation of 6-aminopyrazolono(3,4-  
d)pyrimidine along with 2-amino-8-hydroxypurine  
when 2,4-diamino-5-pyrimidinecarboxamide was  
treated with sodium hypobromite.

pyrazolono(3,4-d)pyrimidines attractive inter­
mediates for the synthesis of 3,6-disubstituted  
pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidines which bear some struc­
tural relationship to the natural purines. This paper  
describes the preparation of 2-methylthio-4-hy-  
drazino-5-carbethoxypyrimidines (I-Y) and 6-  
methylthiopyrazolono(3,4-d)pyrimidines (VI-  
XVII). The synthetic route employed was quite  
similar to that of Michaelis1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  1 0  1 1  who prepared pyrazo-  
lonolutidines and to that of Kenner1 1  who reported  
several indazolones. Michaelis treated 4-chloro-5-  
carbethoxylutidine with hydrazine and several  
arylhydrazines. With the former, he isolated  
pyrazolono(4,3-c)lutidine, and with the latter,  
the corresponding 4-arylhydrazino-5-earbethoxy-  
lutidines. These hydrazinolutidines on heating  
cyclized to 2-substituted pyrazolono(4,3-c)luti-  
dines.
When Kenner treated methyl 2-chloro-3,5-  
dinitrobenzoate with phenylhydrazine, he obtained
5.7- d:nitro-2-phenyl-3-indazolone. With hydrazine,
5.7- d:nitro-3-indazolone was the product. When  
ethyl 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzoate underwent the same  
reaction, the uncyclized products, ethyl 2-(2-  
phenylhydrazino)-5-nitrobenzoate and ethyl 2-  
hydrazino-5-nitrobenzoate, were isolated. These  
both readily underwent base-catalyzed cyclization  
to the corresponding indazolones. The position  
of the phenyl group in the phenylhydrazinobenzoate  
was established by mercuric oxide oxidation to 4-  
nitro-2-carbethoxyazobenzene.
In the present investigation, when hydrazines  
were treated with 2-methylthio-4-chIoro-5-carb-  
ethoxypyrimidine (XVIII),1 2  4-hydrazinopyrimi-  
dines or pyrazolono (3,4-d) pyrimidines were formed,  
depending on the hydrazines used. Hydrazine,  
methylhydrazine, p-nitrophenylhydrazine, and 2,5-  
dichlorophenylhydrazine formed the correspond­
ing hydrazinopyrimidines (I-IV, Table I).

In the conversion of halogenated pyrimidines to  
hydrazinopyrimidines with alkyl and arylhydra-  
zines, it is usually assumed that reaction takes  
place at the nitrogen not bonded to the substitu­
ent.1 3  Hinman1 4  has pointed out that this as­
sumption is not justified in many reactions of  
hydrazines. Schmidt and Druey7  treated isopropyl-  
hydrazine with 2-dimethylamino-4-chloro-5-pyrim-  
idinecarbonitrile and obtained l-isopropyl-3-amino-
6-dimethylaminopyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine. The  
identical compound was obtained by hydrolysis of  
2-dimet hylamino-4 - (1 - isopropyl - 2 - acetylhydra-  
zino)-5-pyrimidinecarbonitrile, confirming the posi­
tion of the isopropyl group. We have found evidence  
to indicate that in the reactions of XVIII with  
hydrazines reaction occurs at the a-nitrogen of the  
alkvlhydrazines and the /3-nitrogen of the aryl-  
hydrazines.
A red to violet color developed when I and II  
were treated with sodium pentacyanoamineferro-  
ate. The test was negative with III and IV. Hy­
drazines of the type RNH—NH2  and R2 N—NH2  
are reported to give a red to violet color with  
this reagent.1 5  The infrared spectra of I and II  
show a medium peak at 1650-1625 cm.“1  ascribed  
to the free amino group at the end of the hydrazine  
group.1 6  This peak is absent in the spectra of III  
and IV. Although II formed an oil when treated  
with acetone, it reacted with propionaldehyde to  
give a solid hydrazone. It was not possible to heat  
II with these reagents; cyclization occurred to form 1 3  1 4  1 5  1 6

Treatment of XVIII with isopropyl, 1,2-di­
methyl-, phenyl-, p-tolyl-, p-bromophenyl-, p-  
chlorophenyl-, p-fluorophenyl-, and p-carboxyphen-  
ylhydrazine gave the pyrazolonopyrimidines,  
(VIII-XV, Table II) directly. In these cases, under  
the conditions used, the intermediate hydrazino­
pyrimidines were not detected.
Based on the data for hydrazinopyrimidines, it  
is probable that VII and VIII are 1-substituted  
pyrazolono (.3,4-d) pyrimidines, while X-XV are  
2-substituted. In addition, hydrolysis of 2-methyl-  
thio-4- (2-acetyl-2-phenylhydrazino) - 5 - carbethoxy-  
pyrimidine (V), prepared from XVIII and 1-acetyl-
1-phenylhydrazine,1 7  gave a compound identical  
with X.
In the aromatic series, of phenylhydrazine and  
the six para-substituted phenylhydrazines treated  
with XVIII, only p-nitrophenylhydrazine did not  
form a pyrazolonopyrimidine directly. This sug­
gests that the high electronegativity of the nitro  
group sufficiently reduced the nucleophilicity of the  
2'-nitrogen to prevent immediate cyclization. The  
weaker electron-attracting groups (p-bromo, p-  
chloro, p-fluoro, and p-carboxy) and the electron­
releasing p-methyl group allow cyclization. The 1 7

failure of IV to cyclize is also explained on the  
basis of low nucleophilicity of the 2'-nitrogen.
In the series of aliphatic-substitnted hydrazino-  
pyrimidines, the 1'-substituent does not greatly  
increase the nucleophilicity of the 2'-nitrogen.  
Further, there is a possible steric effect. Construc­
tion of the 5-carbethoxy-4-hydrazinopyrimidines  
with Courtauld Atomic Models1 8  1 9  indicates that  
the preferred conformation, in those cases where a  
bulky group is located on the 2'-nitrogen, is that  
which places this nitrogen in a position favorable  
for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon.  
With the unsubstituted I and 1  '-substituted II this  
conformation is not necessarily preferred. However,  
in VIII, the substituent, although on the 1'-  
position, is sufficiently bulky to promote cycliza-  
tion when combined with the electron-release prop­
erties of the isopropyl group.

The work of Huber4  on 6-alkoxypurines sug­
gested that 6-alkoxy-2-aminopurines (I) could 
be obtained readily from 2-amino-6-chloropurine 
(HI).
The classical chlorination procedure using phos- 
phoryl chloride has only recently been successfully 
applied to guanine to give III5; we obtained 
III by treating thioguanine (2-amino-6-purinethiol)
(IV) in methanolic suspension with chlorine, a 
slight modification of a process described in a British 
patent.6  This procedure permitted us to isolate the 
hydrochloride of III in 50-60% yield from the 
reaction mixture. The free base could be obtained 
by treating an aqueous suspension of the hydro­
chloride with sodium hydroxide solution.
2-Amino-6-chloropurine (III) is more resistant to 
hydrolysis than is 6-chloropurine7: The conversion 
to guanine (II) is complete after six hours in boiling 
0.1V  hydrochloric acid, whereas after boiling in 
0.1V sodium hydroxide solution, more than 75% 
of III (by ultraviolet absorption) remained un­
changed; the corresponding figures for the hy­
drolysis of 6-chloropurine to 6-purinol (hypoxan­
thine) are one hour in boiling 0.1V hydrochloric 
acid and four hours in boiling 0.1V sodium hy­
droxide.7
However, boiling the hydrochloride of III in 
methanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of 
water leads to the formation of 2-amino-6-meth- 
oxypurine (la) (identified by ultraviolet absorp­
tion spectrum).
For the preparation of 6-alkoxy-2-aminopurines
(I) we treated the hydrochloride of III with a solu­
tion of a ten-fold excess of sodium alkoxide in the 
corresponding alcohol. After the solutions had been 
refluxed for eighteen hours, the compounds listed 
in Table I were isolated in yields ranging from

2-Amino-6-chloropurine  (III) hydrochloride.  A suspension 
of thioguanine (500 mg. 3.3 mmoles) in methanol (25 ml.) 
was cooled to 2° in an ice bath. Dry chlorine gas was bubbled 
through the mixture at such a rate that the temperature 
did not rise above 15°. As soon as the temperature began to 
drop, the stream of chlorine was replaced by a stream of 
dry nitrogen. When the clear solution was almost colorless, 
it was filtered and evaporated until crystallization set in. 
The crystals were collected, washed with ether, and dried

A series of 8-[3-bis(2-chloroethylamino)propionamido [quinolines has been prepared for evaluation as anticancer agents.
8-Amino-6-methoxyquinoline apparently cannot be reductively alkylated with acetals or aldehydes. Certain aspects of the 
synthesis of 8-(3-aminopropylamino)-2-methoxyquinoline have been clarified.
In recent years considerable interest has been 
displayed in the so-called antimalarial mustards 
as possible chemo-therapeutic agents in the man­
agement of neo-plasticdisease.Thesesubstancesmay 
be broadly defined as embracing standard anti- 
malarial drugs into the molecules of which an 
alkylating function such as the bis-2-chloroethyl- 
amino (nitrogen mustard) is incorporated. The 
rational underlying this approach was based on the 
hope that the antimalarial moiety of the molecule 
would act as a carrier to localize the action of the 
alkylating function.6-7
Fulton and co-workers8  prepared the 2-anilino 
and 2-methyl derivatives of 4-[2-bis(2-chloro- 
ethylamino)ethyl]quinoline as candidate amebo- 
cides. The compounds showed no outstanding prop­
erties in this regard and apparently have not been 
examined as anticancer agents. Creech6  has re­
ported a derivative of 7-chloroquinoline carrying 
the same side-chain among several antimalarial 
mustards which showed appreciable activity against 
ascites tumors in mice. Creech also noted that anti­
tumor activity in animals was retained in the 4- 
aminoquinoline mustards through various altera­
tions in the side-chain and nuclear substitution. 
Jones7 ’9  has reported the results of preliminary clini­
cal trials of the nitrogen mustard analogs of chloro- 
quine (I), quinacrine (II), and pamaquine (III),

mentally different series of reactions and also gave 
somewhat unsatisfactory analytical data. Thus one 
would expect to encounter difficulty in the prepa­
ration and handling of compounds of this type.

this connection is that the introduction of the amide  
function resulted in sharply reduced toxicity.1 1  It  
therefore was desirable to prepare representative  
acylamido derivatives of 8-aminoquinolines which  
also carried the nitrogen mustard function. In­
terest in these compounds is two-fold. It was hoped  
that anticancer activity would be retained with  
lower toxicity and, secondly, that the compounds,  
or their precursors, might provide a better route to  
compounds of the type of III than that used by  
Jones and co-workers.5  The first of these goals has  
apparently been achieved, as preliminary data with  
experimental animal tumors have shown a high  
order of activity coupled with relatively low toxicity  
for many of the substances.1 6  Results of the ap­
proach to the second objective will be reported  
subsequently.
At the outset, attention was directed toward  
possible modifications of the Jones, Price, and Sen  
procedure6  (V-VII) or alternate procedures for the  
preparation of anlogs of III. Initial effort was de­
voted to the preparation of 8-[3-bis(2-chloroethyl-  
amino)propylamino]-2-methoxyquinoline (VII) on  
the basis of preliminary pharmacological data on
8-(3-aminopropvlamino)-2-methoxyquinoline and
8- (3-diethylaminopropylamino) -2-m ethoxyquino-  
line1 6  which indicated that VII might be the com­
pound of choice in this series.

A supply of crude 2-methoxy-8-(3-phthalimido-  
propylamino)quinoline (VIII) was available from  
other work. Fractional crystallization of this re­
sulted in the isolation of a small amount of 8-  
bis (3-phthalimidopropylamino) -2-m ethoxyquino-  
line. Hydrazinolysis of VIII was accomplished by  
the method of Ing and Manske1 7  and V was char­
acterized as its dibenzenesulfonyl derivative. As  
a side-product in the hydrazinolysis a small amount  
of what is believed to be phthalobis[3-(2-methoxy-8-  
quinolylamino)propyl]amide (IX) analogous to  
the 6-methoxy derivative reported by Barber and  
Wragg1 8  from a similar reaction. IX showed

(1947),carbonyl absorption in the infrared at 1665 cm.-1  
similar to that of phthalamide and phthalhydra-  
zide and a strong band at about 1522 cm.-1 which  
probably corresponds to the band at 1538 cm.-1  
in VIII. Conversion of IX to a benzenesulfonyl  
derivative eliminated the band at 1522 cm.-1  
and regenerated carbonyl bands at 1705 and 1768  
cm.-1 typical of phthalimides. Barber and Wragg1 8  2 0  2 1  2 2  
noted that the 6-methoxy analog of IX regenerated  
the phthalimide corresponding to VIII by elimina­
tion of a molecule of primary amine. In view
of the difficulty encountered in handling V and its  
derivatives attention was shifted to 8-amino-6-  
methoxyquinoline (IV).
Mild conditions of hydroxyethylation of prima­
quine [6-methoxy-8-(4-amino-l-methylbutylamino)-  
quinoline] gave no isolatable products and in one  
instance resulted in no reaction. The forcing con­
ditions used by Jones6  were not employed because of  
the danger of alkylating the secondary 8-amino  
group as well as the terminal primary amine.  
Reductive alkylation offered an alternative means  
of introducing the side-chain as a preformed moiety.  
This has been accomplished by various workers  
from 8-aminoquinolines and ketals19-22 or enol  
ethers derived from ketals.2 3  l-Bis(2-hydroxy-  
ethylamino) -4-pentanone6  failed to yield the ketal  
under conditions which are successful with 1-  
diethylamino-4-pentanone. When 3-chloropro-  
pionaldehyde diethyl acetal was allowed to react  
with diethanolamine, the expected 3-diethanol-  
aminopropionaldehyde acetal was obtained in good  
yield. However, attempted condensation of this  
acetal and IV failed. The mixtures obtained when  
the reaction was carried out in the presence of vari­
ous acidic catalysts did not absorb catalytically  
activated hydrogen under conditions which are  
successful with ketals and infrared spectra, indi­
cated only the recovery of starting materials.

attempted, it occurred readily even in the absence  
of acidic catalysts. However, the product did not  
undergo catalytic reduction (as judged by hydrogen  
absorption) and no pure products could be isolated.  
We therefore conclude that preparation of amino-  
alkyl derivatives of IV cannot readily be ac­
complished by reductive alkylation with acetals  
or aldehydes.
The Leuckart method for reductive alkylation  
with formic acid as the reducing agent was also  
investigated with butyraldéhyde and IV. The only  
pure product isolated was the previously known  
formyl derivative of IV. Tomita2 4  has reported  
that only low yields of pamaquine result from a  
modification of the Leuckart reaction under rather  
severe conditions.
Elderfield and co-workers2 5  have suggested that  
alkyl derivatives of IV might be obtained by acyla­
tion of IV followed by reduction of the amide with  
lithium aluminum hydride. However, this approach  
was carried only through the acylation step and the  
proposed reduction was never carried out. It was  
hoped that aminolysis of a suitably substituted  
ester by IV would give a mustard diol carrying an  
amide function such as X which could be reduced  
to XI with lithium aluminum hydride. Addition of  
diethanolamine to methyl acrylate appeared to  
form methyl 3-bis(2-hydroxyethylamino) propio­
nate (XII) very smoothly. Although XII dissociated  
on attempted distillation at 0.4-0.8 mm., it might  
have been useful as a crude product. Similar in­
stability has also been reported for the adduct of  
diethanolamine and acrylonitrile.2 6  Hydrolysis of  
crude XII gave 3-bis(2-hydroxyethylamino)-  
propionic acid which was also prepared from di­
ethanolamine and propiolactone.2 7  3ecause of the

Propiolactone (XIII) reacts with aromatic  
amines to give /3-alanines and hydracrylamides.27-29  
The ratio of the products apparently varies with  
the amine and the conditions of the reaction. Re­
action of IV with XIII in boiling benzene gave a  
mixture from which was isolated 41% of N- 
(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-/3-alanine (XIV) and 24%  
of 6-methoxy-8-hydracrylamidoquinoline (XV). The

thionyl chloride gave 8-(3-chloropropionylamido)-  
quinoline which was identical with the product of  
the reaction of IV with 3-chloropropionyl chloride.  
When the reaction of IV with XIII was carried out  
in hot toluene or xylene substantial amounts of  
polymeric material resulted. However, XIV and XV  
were formed but in lower yields than was the case  
when the reaction was carried out in benzene.
The /3-alanine (XIV) was reduced by lithium  
aluminum hydride in ether to give 8-(3-hydroxy-  
propylamino)-6-methoxyquinoline (XVII) identi­
cal to the substance previously prepared by an  
alternate route.3 0 ’3 1  This may possibly serve as an  
intermediate in the synthesis of the mustard de­
rived from plasmocid (XVIII).
Reaction of XVI with two moles of diethanol­
amine gave up to 95% of the dihydrochloride of  
XIX which was in turn converted by thionyl  
chloride into 8-[3-bis(2-chloroethylamino)pro-  
pionylamido]-S-methoxyquinoline (XX) an amide  
mustard analog of XVIII. Reduction of XIX with  
lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran gave  
the mustard diol (XXI), which should be the ideal  
precursor to the plasmocid mustard (XVIII).  
Isolation and purification of X X  as the dihydro­
chloride was easily accomplished in yields as high  
as 80% based on the amount of IV taken.
Contrary to the smooth reaction which we have  
noted between XVI and diethanolamine, Bergmann  
and Schapiro3 2  report that reaction of XVI with  
diethylamine results in dehydrochlorination and  
that the crude product gives 8-(acrylamido)-6-  
methoxyquinoline on distillation. On the other  
hand, Gaind, Ray, and Sarin1 5  found that 8-(3-  
chloropropionvlamido) quinoline reacted with di­
ethylamine without dehydrochlorination in the  
presence of sodium carbonate. They did not, how­
ever, distill the product, but isolated it as the pic-  
rate. Snyder and Freier1 2  obtained Bergmann’s  
acrylamide from IV and acrylolyl chloride and  
succeeded in adding diethylamine smoothly to the  
vinyl linkage. Again, the product was not distilled  
but isolated as the salt. Thus it is probable that  
Bergmann and Schapiro actually had 8-(3-diethyl-  
aminopropionylamido)-6-methoxyquinoline in hand  
but that this lost diethylamine on distillation.
In view of the encouraging results of preliminary  
screening data for XX against animal tumors,1 5  
the series was extended to include derivatives of
5,6-dimethoxyquinoline, 6-methoxylepidine, and  
2-methoxyquinoline analogous to XVI, XIX, and  
XX. These all proceeded smoothly with the ex­
ception of the conversion of the mustard diol (XXI)  
derived from 2-methoxquinoline to the mustard
(XXII). When XXI was treated with thionyl

demanded by XXII. However, the infrared spec­
trum showed two carbonyl bands at 1705 and 1670  
cm.-1 and methoxyl analyses indicated the absence  
of the 2-methoxyl function. Sheinker and Pomerant­
sev3 3  3 3  3 4  3 5  3 6  report infrared absorption in the carbonyl  
region at 1650 and 1655 cm.-1 for carbostyril and
l-methyl-2-quinolone respectively. l-Methyl-8-ni-  
tro-2-quinolone absorbs at about 1665 cm.-1.  
Therefore the mustard melting at 200° is probably  
the isomeric l-methyl-2-quinolone (XXIII). The  
first carbonyl absorption (1705 cm.-1) is probably  
due to the side chain amide and the other (1670  
cm.-1) to the 2-quinolone. Other amides prepared  
in the course of this work showed carbonyl absorp­
tions from 1660 to 1700 cm.-1 However, none hav­
ing the 1-methyl-2-quinolone structure were avail­
able. Recrystallization of the second hydrochloride  
gave the salt of XXII. This showed the presence  
of the methoxyl group on analysis and showed only  
one carbonyl band in the infrared at 1680 cm.-1. On  
the other hand reaction of the hydrochloride of  
XXI with thionyl chloride gave XXII smoothly.
Details as to the physiological properties of  
these compounds will be reported elsewhere.

to the absence of a strong band at 1538 cm . -1 in the spec­
trum of the 2-methoxy-8-bis(3-phthalimidopropylamino)-

The carbonyl bands were at 1715 and 1765 cm . -1 in the

Hydrazinolysis of  VIII. 8-(3-Aminopropylamino)-2-meth- 
oxyquinoline has been the subject of pharmacological study 1 6  
but its chemistry has not been recorded .3 7 Pure VIII 
(25.0 g.) was suspended in 250 ml. of ethanol, hydrazine 
hydrate (3.8 g.) was added, and the mixture was refluxed 
gently for 3.5 hr. After cooling in the refrigerator, the nearly 
solid cake was filtered, washed, and dried to give 24.2 g. 
(89%) of the intermediate phthalhydrazide salt, m.p. 185- 
195°, of 8-(3-aminopropylamino)-2-methoxyquinoline; re­
ported 3 7 m.p. 178.5-181°. In another run the intermediate 
was recrystallized from a large volume of alcohol without 
appreciably altering its melting point. The recrystallized 
material was suspended in water, made basic with N sodium 
hydroxide, and extracted with ether. The ethereal extract 
was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and acidified 
by dropwise addition of an alcoholic solution of hydrogen 
chloride. The hydrochloride of V (11.6 g.) melted at 156- 
159° dec., solidified and remelted at 245-251°. This salt 
has been reported as melting at 240-245° after sintering at 
140-144°.3 7
In another run, the reaction mixture was acidified while 
still hot with 6N hydrochloric acid and the phthalhydrazide 
was filtered. However, when the hydrochloride of V was 
allowed to crystallize directly from the filtrate, it still con­
tained up to 11% of phthalhydrazide. In view of this and 
the susceptibility of the 2-methoxyl group to acid, this 
method of working up the reaction mixture was abandoned.
When 250 ml. of absolute alcohol was substituted for 95% 
alcohol in the above hydrazinolysis, some difficulty with 
bumping caused by separated solid was encountered. After 
refluxing for 3 hr. most of the alcohol was distilled, the resi­
due was mixed with excess sodium hydroxide solution and 
the free amine (V) was extracted with ether. After washing 
with water, the combined ethereal extracts were dried over 
anhydrous potassium carbonate. Acidification of the basic 
aqueous solution from the ether extraction gave 9.2 g. 
(82%) of phthalhydrazide, m.p. 343-344° dec. During the 
drying of the ether extracts, a colorless precipitate separated 
and was filtered off with the potassium caroonate. Acidifica­
tion of the ether filtrate with 2A r alcoholic hydrogen chloride 
(prepared from coned, aqueous hydrochloric acid) gave 15.6 
g. of the hydrochloride of V, m.p. 159-160° dec., solidifying 
and remelting at 248-254°. The carbonate residue from the 
ether filtrate was washed with water leaving 2.1 g. of in­
soluble base, m.p. 147-150°. After six recrystallizations 
from ethanol it melted at 148-152°.

(18.7, 18.8% Cl) which corresponds to 1.5 equivalents of 
hydrogen chloride per molecule of quinoline. It has been 
frequently observed that derivatives of 8-aminoquinoline 
do not react with stoichiometric amounts of acid.4 1  We 
interpret this behavior as indicating that the original 2- 
methoxyquinoline derivative (V) rearranges to the N- 
methylquinolone under the influence of heat.
The unrearranged hydrochloride was also titrated against

cooled to 5°, 5 g. of propiolactone was slowly added. There 
was no evidence of a spontaneous reaction and the mixture 
was allowed to stand overnight. Addition of a solution of 2 
g. of sodium hydroxide in 30 ml. of water caused a moder­
ately vigorous reaction (hydrolysis of unchanged lactone). 
The ether layer was separated, washed with water, and dried.

Evaporation of the ether left 12 g . of fairly pure unchanged
IV. Neutralization of the basic solution with 5 ml. of coned, 
hydrochloric acid gave 0.25 g. (1.5%) of V-(6-methoxy-8- 
quinolyl)-/3-alanine (XIV), m.p. 142-144° after recrystal­
lization from dilute ethanol.

Found: C, 63.33; H, 5.72; N, 11.35.
When the reaction mixture was refluxed for 45 hr., the 
yield of XIV was 15%.
B. In benzene.  To a solution of 92 g. of IV in 600 ml. of 
warm benzene 39 g. of propiolactone was added. After re­
fluxing for 70 hr. the cooled solution was extracted with an 
aqueous solution of 22 g. of sodium hydroxide. The aqueous 
solution was extracted with five 50-ml. portions of benzene. 
Concentration of the combined benzene solution and ex­
tracts left 45 g. of dark viscous oil. Crystallization from 100 
ml. of benzene wbh charcoal gave 10.7 g. (8.2%) of 6- 
methoxy-8-hydracrylamidoquinoline (XV), m.p. 97.5-98.5°. 
The mother liquors contained further amounts of XV along 
with unchanged IV.

The hydrochloride of XV melted at 179-184° dec. after 
recrystallization from absolute ethanol.

When the reaction was run in refluxing xylene, it darkened 
rapidly in 5-10 min. Therefore it was allowed to stand over­
night at room temperature during which a dark precipitate 
appeared. Addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide dissolved 
the precipitate and the mixture was continuously extracted 
with benzene for 24 hr. From the extracts 6% of XV was 
obtained. Careful acidification of the aqueous layer gave 
34% of XIV along with a lump of black tar which was 
picked out manually.
When the reaction was run in toluene by gradually raising 
the temperature to 105° over 90 min., 13% of XV and 30% 
of XIV were obtained.
8-(3-Hydrozypropylamino)~6-methoxyquinoline  (XVII). 
Absolute ether (200 ml.) containing a few mg. of lithium 
aluminum hydride was placed in a flask connected to a 
Soxhlet extractor and a condenser protected by a calcium 
chloride tube. After standing for a few minutes to insure 
dryness, 2.0 g. of hydride was added to the ether and 5 g. of 
XIV was placed in the thimble which was then filled with 
sand. Additional ether was added from time to time to main­
tain the volume. After a few days all the XIV had been 
extracted and the Soxhlet was replaced by a reflux condenser 
protected by a calcium chloride tube. After refluxing for 13 
days, excess hydride was decomposed by successive addi­
tion of ethyl acetate and water. After filtering, the ether layer 
was separated, washed with water until neutral, and dried 
over anhydrous sodium carbonate. Cautious acidification 
of the aqueous solution gave no unchanged XIV. To the 
dried ether solution 50 ml. of absolute ethanol was added 
followed by 25 ml. of 1.5V alcoholic hydrogen chloride. 
The hydrochloride of XVII crystallized as clumps of orange 
needles, m.p. 170-177° dec. in 60% yield. After recrystal­
lization from absolute ethanol and dry ether containing a 
little hydrogen chloride it melted at 178-180° dec. with 
preliminary sintering. Reported melting point for material 
prepared by another method is'178°3 0  and 171-172°.3 1

From 6-methoxy-8-hydracrylamidoquinoline.  To a solution of 
5.0 g. of XV in 50 ml. of chloroform dried over calcium 
chloride in a flask equipped with a dropping funnel, stirrer, 
and condenser, a solution of 3 ml. of pure thionyl chloride 
in 50 ml. of dry chloroform was added with stirring during 30 
min. while the temperature was held at 10°. After standing 
15 min. at room temperature the mixture was refluxed for 1  
hr. After cooling 13 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate was 
added and, after stirring for a few minutes, water was addedcautiously. The chloroform layer was separated, filtered, and 
concentrated to give 5.7 g. of residue. Recrystallization from 
2-propanol gave 86% of colorless needles, m.p. 104-105°; 
reported3 2  m.p. 104°.

B. From 8-amino-6-melhoxyquinoline.  To a cooled solution 
of 10.0 g. of IV in 50 ml. of chloroform, previously dried 
over calcium chloride, and 5 ml. of pyridine 6 ml. of 3- 
chloropropionyl chloride was added gradually during 20 min. 
during which the temperature was maintained at 5-15°. 
After allowing the mixture to come to room temperature, a 
cold solution of 15 g. of potassium carbonate in 50 ml. of 
water was added with good stirring and cooling. The chloro­
form layer was separated and the aqueous layer was ex­
tracted with fresh chloroform. Concentration of the washed 
and dried chloroform solution gave 12.7 g. (84%) of XVI, 
m.p. 104.5-105.5° after recrystallization from 2-propanol.
8-[8-Bis{2-hydroxyethylamino)propionamido]-6-methoxy-  
quinoline  (X). To a solution of 8.0 g. of redistilled diethanol­
amine in 100 ml. of absolute ethanol was added 10.0 g. 
of XVI and the mixture was refluxed for 48 hr. After removal 
of the alcohol under reduced pressure, the residue was taken 
up in chloroform and the solution was washed with water 
until the wash water was neutral. After drying over anhy­
drous sodium carbonate, removal of the solvent left 16 g. 
of pale yellow viscous material which was perfectly satis­
factory for the preparation of the mustard, XIX. For char­
acterization the crude product was converted to the hydro­
chloride by solution in 150 ml. of absolute ethanol at 65° 
and acidification with 80 ml. of 1.5 V alcoholic hydrogen 
chloride. A copious precipitate (95%) of fine yellow needles 
formed which was collected and washed with absolute 
ethanol. It was recrystallized from methanol-ether. Physical 
constants and analytical data for this and related com­
pounds are given in Table I.
The picrate, prepared in benzene and recrj-stallized from 
methanol, melted at 169-171°.

8-\8-Bis{2-chloroethylamino)propionamido]-6-methoxyquin-  
oline  (XIX). Crude X prepared from 40 g. of XVI was 
cooled in an ice bath and 30 ml. of ice-cold purified thionyl 
chloride was added all at once. The flask was closed with 
a calcium chloride tube and kept in the ice bath for an hour 
with occasional swirling during which most of the diol dis­
solved. The mixture was allowed to come to room tem­
perature overnight and concentrated under reduced pres­
sure. The residue was warmed in 130 ml. of absolute ethanol 
and 20 ml. of 1.5V alcoholic hydrogen chloride was added 
during which the hydrochloride of XIX crystallized. After 
standing overnight the bright yellow granular crystals were 
collected and recrj'stallized by solution in 100 ml. of meth­
anol and 20 ml. of 1.5V alcoholic hydrogen chloride, filtra­
tion and dilution with 100 ml. of absolute ether. The melting 
point varied somewhat with the rate of heating.
8- [3-Bis  (2-chloroethylamino ) propionamido] -5,6-d imethoxy-  
quinoline.  The chloroamide and diol were prepared from 5,6- 
dimethoxy-8-aminoquinoline1 9  as in the preceding instance. 
Dry 8-[3-bis(2-hydroxyethylamino)propionamido]-5,6-di- 
methoxyquinoline hydrochloride (8.0 g.) was moistened with 
chloroform previously dried over calcium chloride and 
chilled in an ice-salt bath in a flask protected with a calcium 
chloride tube. To the mixture 16 ml. of purified thionyl 
chloride w as added in one portion with swirling and cooling. 
The hydrochloride dissolved to give an orange solution in 
5-10 min. The mixture was kept in the ice bath for 40 min. 
and then at room temperature for an hour after which the 
chloroform and excess thionyl chloride were removed under 
reduced pressure at 40°. The residue was crystallized from 
80 ml. of absolute ethanol and 100 ml. of absolute ether. 
The very hygroscopic dihydrochloride was recrystallized 
from ethanol-ether in the presence of excess hydrogen chlo-

dine. The chloropropionamide was prepared as in the above 
cases from 8-amin>4>-methoxylepidine.1 2  A solution of 15 g. 
of the chloropropionamide and 11.3 g. of redistilled diethanol 
amine in 225 ml. of absolute ethanol was refluxed for 40 
hr. and concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved 
in chloroform and washed free of diethanolamine hydro­
chloride with water. After drying over anhydrous carbonate, 
the residue was crystallized from 150 ml. of absolute ethanol 
to give the diol as large prisms. The mustard was prepared 
in chloroform solution as described above. The dihydro­
chloride was recrystallized from methanol-ether with excess 
hydrogen chloride and showed a double melting point, de­
composing at 178°, resolidifying as large plates, and melting 
again at 207-220° dec. in an evacuated capillary.
8-[3-Bis(2-chloroethylamino)propionamido]-2-methoxy-  
quinoline  (XXII) and 8-[3-bis(2-chloroelhylamino)propion-

amide was prepared from 8-amino-2-methoxyquinoline as 
described above. The diol (XXI) was obtained as the 
monohydrochloride from methanol-ether with a slight excess 
of hydrogen chloride.
Direct treatment of the crude free base (XXI) with 
thionyl chloride gave no characterizable product. A solu­
tion of 2.0 g. of the monohydrochloride of XXI in water 
was made alkaline with sodium hydroxide and extracted 
with alcohol free chloroform. After drying the extract over 
anhydrous potassium carbonate, a solution of 10 ml. of 
redistilled thionyl chloride in 20 ml. of alcohol-free chloro­

a calcium chloride tube. An oily precipitate that did not 
crystallize formed. Excess thionyl chloride was decomposed 
by addition of 10 ml. of methanol during which the oil 
solidified. It was too hygroscopic to collect on a filter satis­
factorily. The tacky mass was dried in a desiccator to give 
a hard hygroscopic mass. Recrystallization from 2-propanol 
with excess alcoholic hydrogen chloride gave 112 mg. of 
material, m.p. 200-201.5° dec. The major portion of the 
product was recovered by concentrating the original 
chloroform-methanol filtrate and recrystallizing the residue 
from methanol-ether. This gave two slightly pink crops of 
0.5 g. (46%) each. The first sintered from 180° and melted 
at 182-183° and the second melted at 163-164° dec. Re­
crystallization of the first fraction from methanol-ether 
gave material, m.p. 199.5-201.5° dec., which showed 
carbonyl absorption in the infrared at 1670 and 1705 cm.-1 
As no methoxyl was present on analysis, this is the ¿V-methyl-

The second crop of crystalline material showed only a

substantially unchanged. This was the monohydrochloride 
of the desired mustard (XXII).
When the hydrochloride of XXI was treated with thionyl

Received March 7, 1960
Candidate cytotoxic agents have been prepared by condensation of 2,4-dichloro-6-methvl-5-nitropyrimidine with various 
cyclic amines. The relative activating influence of a nitro, chloro, and bromo substituent in the 5-position of 2,4-dichloro-
6-methylpyrimidine toward nucleophilic displacement of the chlorines has been studied.
Since 1946, when Gilman and Philips4  reported  
the cytotoxic activity of bis-j3,/3'-dichloroethyl-  
methylamine (nitrogen mustard), a number of  
cytotoxic substances containing the bis-y3,(S'-di-  
chloroethylamine functions have been reported.5  
Most of these, except for some derivatives of

parent compounds which are not of natural oc­

important purines and pyrimidines has been largely  
directed to the preparation of analogs of them  
as possible antimetabolites and, until compara­
tively recently, few reports of incorporation of  
alkylating functions such as the bis-/3,j3'-dichloro-  
ethylamino or aziridino groups into these parent  
molecules have appeared. The rationale underlying  
the present work, a portion of which is presented,

therefore, is based on the concept that incorpora­
tion of such functions into a pyrimidine or purine  
might provide cytotoxic agents capable of acting  
in a dual capacity—as antimetabolites and as  
alkylating agents. Prior to the present investiga­
tion cytotoxic activity had been reported for 6-  
methyl-5-bis(l 8,/3,-dichloroethylamino;-uracil1 0  1 1  and  
during the course of this work similar activity was  
reported for 5-bis(/3,i8'-dichloroethylamino)uracil.n  
Hendry and co-workers1 2  report the synthesis and  
anti-tumor evaluation of a number of aziridino  
derivatives of pyrimidine and conclude that, in  
general, these substances show no selective cyto­
toxic activity with respect to tumor cells as com­
pared to normal cells. There thus appears to be a  
division of opinion as far as selective cytotoxic  
activity of pyrimidines carrying an alkylating  
function is concerned. In view of the known use­
fulness of 2,4,6-triaziridinotriazine in the manage­
ment of certain cases of lymphatic and chronic  
myologeneous leukemia, it appeared that prepara­
tion of further representative aziridinopyrimidines  
was indicated.
2,4-Bisaziridmo-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine (I)  
was readily prepared in 70% yield by condensation  
of aziridine with 2,4-dichlcro-G-methyl-5-nitro-  
pyrimidine (II) in the presence of an equivalent  
amount of triethylamine. I is very susceptible to  
decomposition during purification especially in the  
presence of moisture. I was also prepared in low  
yield by adding an aqueous solution of aziridine  
and potassium hydroxide to an aqueous suspension  
of II and by successive reaction of II with sodium  
hydride and aziridine in ether or tetrahydrofuran.
Treatment of I with dry hydrogen chloride in  
ether resulted in opening of the aziridine rings and  
formation of a hydrochloride (III) for which a  
number of structures are possible. Cyclization to a  
piperazinium salt (IIIA) in a manner analogous to  
that noted by Golumbic1 3  and Huber1 4  with other  
/3-chloroethylamines is suggested by the high de­
composition point and insolubility of the salt in  
water. Reclosure of the opened aziridine ring on one  
of the pyrimidine nitrogens to give an imidazo-  
pyrimidine derivative (IIIB) is possible on the  
basis of the observation of Schaefer1 5  that 1-aziri-  
dino-s-triazines rearrange in the presence of acid  
catalysts to dihydroimidazo[1.2-a]-s-triazines. It  
is impossible to distinguish between III, IIIA,  
and IIIB on the basis of elementary analyses.  
However, titration of the substance with 0.01V

monohvdrochloride which eliminates structure  
IIIA. The product of the titration without neutrali­
zation can then be represented by IV, IVA, or  
IVB. It was also obtained by the action of sodium  
methoxide in benzene on III. A substance of struc­
ture IV would be expected to be soluble in ether  
and insoluble in water which was found to be  
so. This, as well as elementary analyses, in all  
probability rules out structures IVA and IVB leav­
ing III as representing the initial product of the  
action of anhydrous hydrogen chloride on I and IV  
as representing the product resulting from the  
action of base on III. We assume that the presence  
of the nitro group in the 5-position weakens the  
basicity of the nitrogens in the 2- and 4-positions  
sufficiently to render salt formation difficult.
Preliminary data on the action of I on animal  
tumors1 6  was exceedingly encouraging. Since it  
was not known whether I was functioning as an  
alkylating agent, as an antimetabolite or in a dual  
capacity, it appeared to be of advantage to sub­
stitute other amines for aziridine in the reaction  
with II. Therefore II was condensed with azetidine.  
pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine to give  
V, VI, VII, and VIII respectively. As the satu­
rated heterocyclic ring system was expanded the  
color of the compounds changed progressively from  
light lemon yellow in the case of I to a very dark  
yellow in the case of VIII. All of the substances  
showed similar insolubility in water and solubility  
in most organic solvents.
A difference in reactivity of the chlorine atoms in  
II was noted and advantage was taken of this to  
introduce two different amine residues in the 2-  
and 4-positions. By analogy with the reaction of 2,4-  
dichloro-5-nitropyrimidine with ammonia under  
mild conditions to give 4-amino-2-chloro-5-nitro-  
pyrimidinc1 7  we assume that the 4-chlorine is most  
readily displaced in II. Thus when II was allowed  
to react with one equivalent of p-fluoroaniline at  
0 °, 2-ehloro-4 - (p - fluoroanilino) - 6 -methyl - 5 - nitro-  
pyrimidine (IX) was formed. When IX was treated  
with a second equivalent of an amine under more  
severe conditions 2,4-diaminopyrimidines (X, XI  
and XII) resulted.
On the other hand when II was allowed to react  
with excess representative amines, p-fluoroaniline  
and furfurylamine, in boiling ethanol both chlorines  
were replaced with the formation of diamino  
derivatives (X and XIII) respectively.
The reaction of II with 2-aminoethanol or 3-  
aminopropanol took a somewhat different course.  
On refluxing the reactants in ethanol the 4-chlorine  
of II readily underwent displacement by the  
amine, but the 2-chlorine was hydrolyzed, possibly

by water present in the system, with the formation  
of 2-hydroxy-4- (2-hydroxyethylamino) -6-methyl-5-  
nitropyrimidine and 2-hydroxy-4-(3-hydro xypro-  
pylamino)-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine respectively.
Finally, since the nitro group in II is obviously  
activating the chlorines in positions 2 and 4, it was  
of interest to study the effect of other substituents  
in the 5-position of the pyrimidine ring. For this  
purpose the 5-chloro- and 5-bromo- analogs (XIV  
and XV) of II were investigated. Behrend1 8  pre­
pared XIV by heating 6-methyluracil (XVI)  
with phosphorus pentachloride and phosphorus  
oxychloride in a sealed tube. We have obtained  
XIV in almost quantitative yield by heating 5-  
chloro-6-methyluracil (XVII)1 9  with phosphorus  
oxychloride and diethylaniline. For the prepara­
tion of XV Behrend’s method2 0  was not followed.  
This was found to be lengthy and necessitates  
the initial formation of 5,5-dibromo-6-hydroxy-6-  
methyldihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione (XVIII) which  
has almost the same melting point as 5-bromo-6-

cedure of Wang2 1  for the bromination of uracil was  
applied to the bromination of XVI to give XIX  
which could be purified very easily from traces of  
XVIII by solution in a large volume of hot dilute  
potassium hydroxide solution and reprecipitation  
while still hot by acetic acid. Filtration of XIX from  
the acetic acid solution while still hot removed any  
unchanged 6-methyluracil (XVI) since the solu­
bilities of XIX, XVIII, and XVI in the dilute acetic  
acid were roughly in the ratio 0.36:1.36:5.00.  
Actually treatment of XVIII with hot dilute potas­
sium hydroxide probably results in extensive de­
composition since no product could be isolated when  
XVIII alone was subjected to this procedure.  
XVIII with phosphorus oxychloride and dimethyl-  
aniline gave a poor yield of XV together with some
XIX. The procedure of Overberger for the prepara­
tion of XV by treatment of XIX with phosphorous  
oxychloride alone2 2  was improved by use of diethyl-  
aniline to provide an 85-95% yield of XV in less  
than three hours.

Nucleophilic displacement of the chlorines in  
positions 2 and 4 of XIV by aniline, jj-fluoroaniline,  
and furfurylamine was easily accomplished to give  
XX, XXI, and XXII respectively. In general two  
equivalents of amine per atom of chlorine to be re­
placed were required. Thus, when only two equiva­
lents of p-fluoroaniline per equivalent of trichloro-  
pyrimidine (XIV) were used only one chlorine was  
replaced with the formation of 2,5-dichloro-6-  
methyl-4-(p-fluoroanilino)pyrimidine. On the other  
hand reaction of XIV with two equivalents of  
aziridine in the presence of triethylamine in boiling  
ether resulted only in the displacement of the 4-  
chlorine and the formation of XXIII. When the  
reaction was carried out in boiling benzene there  
appeared to be some decomposition of the XXIII  
formed. From the amount of triethylamine hydro­
chloride recovered from the reaction mixture itappeared that only a trace of disubstitution product  
was formed.
The reactions of XV paralleled those of XIV.  
Displacement of both chlorines by aniline, p- 
fluoroaniline, and furfurylamine gave XXIV,  
XXV, and XXVI respectively. With aziridine  
only one chlorine was displaced to give XXVII.  
In contrast, sodium methoxide very readily gave
5-bromo-2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylpyrimidine (XX-  
VIII).
We therefore conclude that a nitro group in the
5-position exerts a strong activating influence on  
chlorine atoms in the 2- and 4-positions, particu­
larly on the 4-chlorine atom. Chlorine and bromine  
in the 5-position exert a much weaker activating  
influence as would be expected. However, the ease  
of displacement of the 2-chlorine seems to be de­
pendent also on the nucleophilicity of the attack­
ing reagent.

2,4-Bisaziridino-6-melhyl-5-nitropyrimidine  (I). Procedure  
A. Through a mixture of 2.4 g. of sodium hydride dispersion 
(courtesy of Metal Hydrides, Inc., Beverly, Mass.) in 20 
ml. of freshly dried and distilled tetrahydrofuran and 2.15 
g. of aziridine, dry nitrogen was passed for a few minutes. 
A solution of 5.2 g. of II in 50 ml. of tetrahydrofuran was 
slowly added and the gas which was immediately evolved 
was collected over water. Substantially the theoretical 
amount of hydrogen was liberated and the reaction mixture 
turned deep brown. After 1  hr. the mixture was hydrolyzed 
with water and extracted with four 50-ml. portions of ether. 
After drying the combined extracts over anhydrous mag­
nesium sulfate, removal of the solvent left a yellow residue 
which, on recrystallization from petroleum ether (b.p. 90- 
100°) with Norit, gave 0.9 g. of light lemon-yellovr  needles, 
m.p. 120-122° dec. When anhydrous ether was substituted 
for tetrahydrofuran the yield was raised to 1.2 g.
Procedure B.  An ice cold mixture of a solution of 3.0 g. 
of potassium hydroxide in 100 ml. of water and a solution of 
2.15 g. of aziridine in 50 ml. of water was added to a well 
stirred ice cold suspension of II prepared by adding a solu­
tion of 5.2 g. of II in 50 ml. of acetone to 200 ml. of water. 
When the addition was complete (30 min.) the ice bathvras 
removed and stirring was continued for 16 hr. during which 
a voluminous precipitate separated. The solid was filtered, 
washed with water, and dried. The yield vT as 1.3 g.
Procedure C.  To a well stirred and chilled solution of 
10.4 g. of II in 200 ml. of anhydrous ether was added drop- 
wise a solution of 4.4 g. of aziridine and 10.2 g. of triethyl­
amine in 200 ml. of dry benzene at a rate such that the tem­
perature of the mixture did not exceed 10°. When the addi­
tion was complete (30-45 min.) 200 ml. of dry benzene was 
added to dilute the thick paste which formed. After stirring 
for an additional 30 min. below 10°, the ice bath was re­
moved and the mixture was stirred for 12-15 hr. at room 
temperature. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was 
evaporated to dryness below 40° under reduced pressure. 
The residue was crystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 
90-100°) to give 7.7 g. of lemon yellow needles, m.p. 122- 
123°. Concentration of the mother liquor gave additional 
material and raised the total yield to 8.2 g. Analyses for 
this and other pyrimidines prepared from II are given in

2.4- Bisazetidino-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine  (V).2 5  2 6  From a 
solution of 11.1 g. of moist azetidine2 6  dried over potassium 
hydroxide according to Marckwald2 7  and 11.1 g. of triethyl- 
amine in 50 ml. of dry ether and a solution of 10.4 g. of II 
in 700 ml. of dry ether, 7.83 g. of V was obtained by Pro­
cedure C above. The substance was recrystallized first from 
benzene-petroleum ether and finally from petroleum ether 
(b.p. 60-80°). It formed long bright yellow needles, m.p. 
135°. One more recrystallization raised the melting point 
to 141-142°.
2.4- Bis-l'-pyrrolidino-6-methyl-5-nilopyrimidine  (VI). A 
solution of 7.1 g. of pyrrolidine in 50 ml. of absolute ethanol 
was added with stirring during 45-60 min. to an ice cold 
solution of 8.32 g. of II in 100 ml. of absolute ethanol. When 
the addition was complete the mixture was heated gently 
on the steam bath for 24 hr. during which a light brown 
pasty mass was formed. The magma was triturated with 
acetone and filtered from 1.5 g. of high melting (256-258°) 
material which was not investigated further. The filtrate 
was concentrated to about 20 ml. and poured with stirring 
into 300 ml. of ice water. The pasty mass which separated 
solidified after standing at room temperature for 48 hr. 
yielding 5.5 g. (50%) of brownish yellow material, m.p. 146- 
148°. After two recrystallizations from aqueous acetone 
bright yellow granular crystals, m.p. 149-150°, were 
obtained. The same substance was obtained in 61% yield 
by Method C described above for the preparation of I.

5.1 g. of triethylamine in 20 ml. of benzene were mixed. To 
the cold and well stirred mixture was added a solution of
4.25 g. of piperidine in 40 ml. of benzene over 15 min. 
After stirring for 16 hr. at room temperature the mixture 
was refluxed for 4 hr., filtered while still hot, and concen­
trated. The residual pasty mass was taken up in 100 ml. of 
hot ethanol and the solution was diluted with 200 ml. of 
water. On slow evaporation 4.8 g. (63%) of yellow crystals 
were obtained. After two recrystallizations from aqueous 
acetone bright yellow micro needles, m.p. 99-100°, resulted.
2.4- Bis-4-m.orpholino-6-methyl-5-nilropyrimidine  (VIII). 
This was prepared by the method used for VII. The yield 
of material, m.p. 162-163°, after recrystallization from 
aqueous acetone was 64%.
2.4- Bisfurfitrylamino-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine  (XIII). 
To a cold solution of 7.8 g. of II in 100 ml. of absolute 
methanol 14.6 g. of freshly distilled furfurylamine (courtesy 
of the Quaker Oats Co.) was added dropwise over 15-20 
min. during which solid material separated. The mixture was 
then refluxed gently on the steam bath during which the 
solids dissolved. After addition of 150 ml. of benzene the 
solution was boiled down to about half its volume and fil­
tered while still hot. On cooling, the filtrate deposited 6.5 
g. (52%) of light yellow solids. Recrystallization from ethyl 
acetate-petroleum ether (b.p. 90-100°) gave crystalline 
material, m.p. 115-116°.
2.4- Bis(P-chIoToethylainino)-6-methyl-5-nitrcpyrimidine hy­
drochloride  (III). Dry hydrogen chloride was passed slowly 
through a solution of 1.1 g. of I in 200 ml. of anhydrous 
ether chilled in an ice-salt bath for 30 min. The temperature 
of the solution was held below 10°. A voluminous white 
precipitate separated and further absorption of hydrogen 
chloride ceased. The solids were collected and washed 
thoroughly with cold anhydrous ether to give 1.63 g. (98%) 
of cream colored material which decomposed slowly above 
200°. Two recrystallizations from anhydrous acetone- 
petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°) gave an analytically pure 
sample although the melting point was still indefinite. Ill, 
however, was found to melt with decomposition at 175—  
177°, when put in a bath previously heated to 175°. If

0.661 g. of III in 50 ml. of ice water was titrated with 0.01 A 
sodium hydroxide solution to phenolphthalein end point. 
Calculated for one equivalent of sodium hydroxide: 200 
ml. Found: 203 ml. The suspended yellowish solids were 
collected, washed thoroughly with water, and dried. The 
yield was 0.58 g. (98.6%). Recrj'stallization from ether- 
petroleum ether (40-60°) gave lemon needles, m.p. 145- 
146° dec. in a bath preheated to 145°. If ohe bath tempera­
ture was lower than 145°, the substance did not melt 
sharply but slowly decomposed up to 200°. The infrared 
spectrum was quite different from that of III.

with vigorous stirring a solution of 0.069 g. of sodium in 30 
ml. of absolute methanol. The suspended solid -went into 
solution and sodium chloride separated. After stirring for 2 
hr. at room temperature, about 50 ml. of solvent was dis­
tilled off in the course of an hour. The mixture was then 
taken to dryness under reduced pressure and the residue was 
extracted with 300 ml. of ether in a Soxhlet extractor for 12 
hr. The ether extract was boiled with carbon, filtered and, 
while still hot, was slowly added to 150 ml. of boiling 
petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°). On cooling fine yellow needles 
separated. This substance was identical with that obtained 
by Procedure A as judged by melting point behavior and 
identical infrared spectra.

2.4- Bis{p-ftuoroanilino)-6-methyl-5-nitrovyrimidine  (X). 
To a solution of 5.2 g. of II in 200 ml. of absolute ethanol 
was added 6.1 g. of p-fluoroaniline. There was an immediate 
separation of yellow' solid. The mixture was heated on thesteam bath on which the solid material went into solution 
but within 5 min. a precipitate reappeared. The mixture 
was refluxed for 1  hr. and allowed to stand overnight at 
room temperature. The solid material, 8.5 g., m.p. 215- 
220 dec., was collected and recrystallized from cyclohexane- 
benzene to narrow the melting point to 218-220° dec. On 
slow heating the substance melted at 185-187° dec.
2-Chloro-4-(p-fluoroanilino) -6 - methyl -5 - nitropyrimidine
(IX). To a stirred solution of 5.2 g. of II chilled in an ice- 
salt bath was added dropwise a solution of 2.8 g. of p- 
fluoroaniline in 20 ml. of absolute ethanol. After stirring for 
30 min. in the freezing bath, the mixture was stirred for an 
additional 30 min. at room temperature, cooled, and filtered 
to give 2.5 g. of dark yellow crystalline material. The 
filtrate on concentration gave an additional 3.0 g. of the 
same substance. (Total yield, 77%.) On recrystallization 
from methylcyclohexane, 4.2 g. of yellow woolly crystals, 
m.p. 152-154°, resulted.

methylamine, and 100 ml. of absolute ethanol w'as heated 
gently on the steam bath for 48 hr., without reflux. Sub­
stantially dry light yellow crystalline material, m.p. 165- 
175°, remained. This was triturated with dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution, collected, and washed thoroughly with 
water. After recrystallization from aqueous methanol and 
two recrystallizations from petroleum ether (b.p. 90-100°) 
fine yellow micro-crystals, m.p. 172-173°, were obtained.
4-(p-Fluoroanilino)-2-aziridino-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine  
(XII) To a well stirred solution of 2.82 g. of IX in 400 ml. 
of absolute ether was added gradually a solution of 0.53 g. 
of aziridine and 1.1 g. of triethjdamine in 100 ml. of absolute 
ether, the temperature being maintained at 15-20°. After 
the addition was complete the mixture was stirred at room 
temperature for 18 hr. and the separated solid material was 
filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to about 50 ml. and 
added to a solution of 0.23 g. of aziridine and 0.5 g. of tri- 
ethylamine in 100 ml. of benzene, The mixture w ras heated

at 60-70° for 3 hr., filtered through Norit and the filtrate 
was taken to dryness at a temperature below 35°. The oily 
residue was triturated with 60 ml. of anhydrous ether and 
the solution taken to dryness to give 2.0 g. (69%) of yellow 
crystalline material, m.p. 116-119° dec. Four recrystalliza­
tions from petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°) gave an analytical 
sample, m.p. 135-137° dec. The substance gave a negative 
test for chlorine.
2-Hydroxy- 4 -(2'-  hydroxyethylamino) -6 - inethyl - 5-nitro-  
pyrimidine  (XXXI). To a solution of 8.6 g. of II in 125 ml. 
of warm ethanol was added 6.1 g. of 2-aminoethanol. An 
immediate reaction occurred and the mixture turned yellow 
with evolution of heat. The mixture was heated gently on 
the steam bath without reflux for 48 hr. leaving a viscous 
residue. Trituration of the residue with dry acetone gave
11.5 g. of light brown material, m.p. 126-130°. Two re- 
crystallizations from acetone and a little benzene gave 3.0 
g. of shining orange needles, m.p. 147.5-148.5°.
2-Hydroxy-4-(3'-hydroxypropylamino)~ 6 - methyl -5 - nitro-  
pyrimidine  (XXXII). The procedure was the same as the 
preceding one using 8.62 g. of II and 7.51 g. of 3-amino- 
propanol in 150 ml. of absolute ethanol. The crude product 
was triturated with methanol and an analytical sample was 
prepared by solution of the crude material in hot dilute 
hydrochloric acid, filtration and neutralization to about 
pH 8 with ammonium hydroxide. On cooling 1.0 g. of 
granular crystals, m.p. 244.5-245.5° dec. separated.
6-M ethyl-2,4,5-trichloropyrimidine  (XIV). A mixture of
l. 2 g. of XVII,1910 ml. of phosphorus oxychloride, and 2 ml. 
of diethylaniline was heated under reflux with stirring for 3 
hr. After standing at room temperature for 24 hr., the light 
brown solution was poured cautiously onto chopped ice. 
(In larger scale runs the excess phosphorus oxychloride was 
distilled from the mixture under reduced pressure.) The 
mixture, from which solid separated, was extracted with 
five 60-ml. portions of ether and the combined extracts 
were washed with four 50-ml. portions of ice water. After 
drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, removal of the 
solvent left a colorless oil (1.5 g.), b.p. 55-56° (0.2 mm.); 
reported1 8  b.p. 245-247°. Analytical data for XIV, XV, 
and substances prepared from them are given in Table II.
5-Bromo-6-methyluracil  (XIX). To a stirred suspension 
of 3.15 g. of XVI in 100 ml. of water was added dropwise 
4.0 g. of bromine over 15 min. After addition of 150 ml. of 
water the mixture was refluxed for 25 min. and cooled to 50- 
60°. Solid potassium hydroxide was added until a clear 
solution was obtained. The solution was boiled with carbon, 
filtered, and, while still hot, was acidified with acetic acid. 
The white crystalline precipitate was collected, triturated 
with 200 ml. of hot tvater, and collected. The cake was 
washed successively with hot water, alcohol, and ether to 
give 4.4 g. (86%) of material, m.p. 240-242° dec.; reported2 0
m. p. 230° dec. In a 1  mole run the yield was 94%. The 
substance gave a negative test for halogen when boiled 
with nitric acid and silver nitrate for 1  min. In contrast 5,5- 
dibromo-6-hydroxy-6-methyldihydrouracil (XVIII), m.p. 
234-235° dec. after crystallization from water, prepared by 
bromination of XVI with excess bromine in water, gave an 
immediate precipitate with silver nitrate in boiling nitric 
acid.
5-Bromo-2,4-dichloro-6-methylpyrimidine  (XV). A mixture 
of 41.2 g. of XIX, 300 ml. of phosphorus oxychloride, and 
80 ml. of diethylaniline was stirred and slowly heated for 
30 min. and then refluxed for 90 min. The excess oxychloride 
was distilled from the brown mixture at reduced pressure 
and the residue was poured onto cracked ice with vigorous 
stirring. The pinkish-white solid was collected, washed 
thoroughly with water, and sucked as dry as possible. The 
moist filter cake was dried in a vacuum desiccator over phos­
phorus pentoxide and sublimed at 40-50° (0.2 mm.) during 
20 hr. to give 44 g. (88%) of analytically pure material, m.p. 
42°, b.p. 114° (0.3 mm.).
4-Aziridino-2,4-dichloro-6-methylpyrimidine  (XXIII). The 
procedure was the same as Procedure C for the preparationof I. The product (78% yield) was recrystallized first from 
dilute methanol and finally from aqueous acetone. It 
melted at 115-116°.
5-Chloro-2,4-dianilino-6-methylpyrimidine  (XX). A solu­
tion of 4.6 g. of aniline in 50 ml. of dry ether was added to a 
solution of 1.5 g. of XIV in 50 ml. of dry ether. On warming 
for 15 min. the mixture solidified. The solid was collected 
and triturated with 10 ml. of benzene to give 1.6 g. of the 
hydrochloride of XX. After reerystallization first from 
dilute methanol and then from methanol-benzene, ana­
lytically pure material, m.p. 284-285° dec. was obtained.
2,5 - Dichloro - 4 - (p -fluoroanilino) -6 - methyl - pyrimidine  
(XXIX). The procedure was substantially the same as that 
for the preparation of XX except that the reaction mixture 
was allowed to stand for 48 hr. at room temperature for 
completion. The yield of cream colored needles of the hydro­
chloride, m.p. 124-125° after recrystallization from ether- 
petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°), was 50%.
2,4 - Bis{p - fluoroanilino) - 5 - chloro -6 - methylpyrimidine  
(XXI). To a solution of 1.97 g. of XIV in 20 ml. of ether 
was added a solution of 4.4 g. of p-fluoroaniline in 20 ml. of 
ether. After evaporation of the ether on the steam bath the 
residual pasty mass was mixed with 30 ml. of water and 
heated on the steam bath for 72 hr. The brown residual solid 
was triturated with ether and collected. The material was 
taken up in hot ethanol, benzene was added, and the solu­
tion was evaporated to incipient crystallization to give 2.6 
g. (66%) of slate colored crystals, m.p. 275-280° dec. Fur­
ther reerystallization from aqueous ethanol and from 
benzene-petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°) after solution with 
the aid of a little methanol raised the melting point to 282- 
287° dec. This is the hydrochloride of XXI.
The ether from trituration of the crude material was boiled 
with carbon, filtered, and added to hot petroleum ether (b.p. 
40-60°) to give 0.7 g. of crystalline material, m.p. 121 —  
123°. Further reerystallization from the same solvent gave 
cream-colored needles of 2,5-dichloro-4-(p-fluoroanilino)-
6-methylpyrimidine (XXIX), m.p. 124-125°.
4-Aziridino-5-bromo-2-chloro-6-methylpyrimidine  (XXVII). 
To a stirred solution of 2.41 g. of XV in 100 ml. of anhydrous 
ether chilled in an ice bath was added a solution of 0.9 g. 
of aziridine and 2.1 g. of triethylamine in 50 ml. of anhy­
drous ether over 15 min. A further 50 ml. of anhydrous 
ether was added and the mixture was stirred at room tem­
perature for 15 hr. The precipitated triethylamine hydro­
chloride was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated to dry­
ness under reduced pressure. Two recrystallizations of the 
residue from aqueous methanol gave white needles, m.p. 
127-128° dec.
2.4- Bisfurfurylamino-5-chloro-6-methylpyrimidine  (XXII). 
To an ethereal solution of 3.95 g. of XIV was added a solu­
tion of 7.8 g. of furfurylamine in 30 ml. of dry ether. The 
reaction was vigorous and the ether boiled off quickly with 
the temperature rising to 60°. The clear residue was heated 
on the steam bath for an hour and left at room temperature 
for 24 hr. After trituration with dry ether and then with 
w rater, the residue was crystallized from aqueous methanol 
to give white flakes, m.p. 127-128°. Additional material 
was obtained from the mother liquor bringing the total 
yield to 4.6 g. (71%).
2.4- Bisfurfurylamino-5-bromo-6-inethylpyriniidine  (XXVI). 
To a stirred solution of 2.42 g. of XV in 50 ml. of dry ether 
was added a solution of 1.94 g. of furfurylamine and 2.02 g . 
of triethylamine in 100 ml. of dry ether. The mixture was 
stirred for 4 hr. and then slowly evaporated. The pasty 
residue was left at room temperature for 5 days during which 
it solidified. After trituration with water, reerystallization 
from ether-petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°) gave the pure sub­
stance, m.p. 119-120°.
2.4- Bis(p - fluoroanilino) -5 - bromo -6 - methylpyrimidine  
(XXV). The procedure was the same as that for XXVI. 
The crude product was triturated with dry ether to give 
a slate-colored residue (57%) and a browm ether solution. 
Crystallization of the residue from aqueous methanol and
1 5 9 0 SAX, SAARI, MAHONEY, AND GORDON v o l . 2 5
then from methanol-benzene gave the hydrochloride of 
XXV, m.p. 243-244° dec.
The brown ether solution was evaporated to drj-ness and 
the residue was recrystallized from benzene-petroleum ether 
and then from ether-petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°) to give 
25% of 5-bromo-2-chloro-4-(p-fluoroanilino)-6-methylpy- 
rimidine as white needles (XXX), m.p. 143°.
5-Bromo-2,4-dw,nilino-6-methylpyrimidine  (XXIV). The 
procedure was substantially the same as that for XXVI 
except that the reaction mixture was warmed in benzene 
for 24 hr. at 40-60°. The insoluble product was washed with 
ether, taken up in methanol, and precipitated by addition 
of benzene to give crystalline material, m.p. 247-249° dec. 
This was probably the hydrochloride of XXIV. The free 
base (50% yield) was obtained by recrystallization of the 
salt from dilute acetic acid. Further recrystallization fromether-petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°) gave micro-needles, 
m.p. 111-112°.
b-Bromo-2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylpyrimidine  (XXVIII). To 
a solution of 5.06 g. of sodium in 200 ml. of absolute meth­
anol at 10-15° was added with stirring a solution of 13.3 g. 
of XV in 100 ml. of absolute methanol over 25 min. The 
mixture was refluxed for an hour and stirred at room tem­
perature for 15 hr. The solid was filtered and washed with 
methanol. Carbon dioxide was passed into the filtrate until 
the pH was about 8. The separated solids (5.2 g.) were 
collected and the filtrate was taken to dryness. The residue 
was triturated with water leaving 10.0 g. (78%) of white 
insoluble material. Distillation gave 7.2 g. of material, 
b.p. 96-99° (0.5 mm.), m.p. 76-77°.

The preparation and infrared absorption spectra of a number of aryl and alkyl-aryl ethers are recorded. In general, the 
assignments in the infrared regions of the spectra agree with those reported in the literature for benzene derivatives and aryl 
ethers. The m-disubstituted materials have their benzene-oxygen stre'ch band at a lower frequency than those previously 
reported.
A number of phenyl and alkyl-phenyl ethers were  
recently prepared for evaluation as radiation-resist­
ant, high temperature lubricants.2  Many of the  
products have not previously been reported. At the  
same time the infrared absorption spectra of both  
known and new compounds were recorded and the  
results compared with those of previous workers.3-10
Phenyl ethers and certain of their derivatives  
were prepared because, unlike alkyl ethers, they  
are very resistant to oxidation. Their thermal de­
composition temperatures far exceed those of  
present synthetic lubricants and their resistance  
to radiolysis is excellent.
The high melting points of many of the products  
exclude them from consideration as lubricants

the better known para-linked polyphenyl ethers  
show a rise in melting point with increasing chain  
length. In the meia-linked series the melting point  
of certain compounds is surprisingly low. Thus,  
while m-diphenoxybenzene melts at 47° or 60°  
depending on crystal form, bis(m-phenoxyphenyl)  
ether (III) melts at 41°. The mefa-linked ethers  
have a strong tendency to supercool; so far the  
higher members of the series (XI and XII) have  
not been obtained in crystalline form.
Most of the ethers were prepared by the Ull-  
mann1 1  ether synthesis. The exceptions (XXIX and  
XXX) were prepared from bis(chloromethyl)-  
durene and potassium o- or p-feri-butylphenate  
under milder conditions.
Synthetic problems arose only in the preparation  
of the mefa-linked ethers. ?n-Dibromobenzene was  
prepared from wi-bromoaniline via the Sandmeyer  
reaction. m-Bromophenyl phenyl ether was pre­
pared either from m-phenoxyanilinc by the same  
reaction or from phenol and m-dibromobenzene  
by the Ullmann procedure. w-Phenoxyphenol1 2 ’1 3  
was prepared by three different routes (Fig. 1),  
as stability problems connected with certain  
starting materials required clarification.

Fig. 1. Preparation of m-phenoxyphenol
of the monopotassium salt of resorcinol with bromo-  
benzene, gives only tars. Method A (R = alkyl)  
gives pure m-phenoxyphenol after either acid1 2 a  
or base1 2 b  hydrolysis unless the starting material  
contains ring-alkylated impurities. These impuri­
ties were demonstrated in a commercial sample of  
m-methoxyphenol by NMR spectroscopy,1 4  1 5  al­
though they could not be found by either gas-  
liquid chromatography or infrared absorption  
spectroscopy. The ring-substituted methyl ab­
sorption is easily distinguished from the methoxyl  
or any other methyl absorption and may be used  
for semi-quantitative work. No such absorption  
was found with materials of known purity. Thus no  
ring alkylation occurs during hydrolysis.
Ring alkylation of resorcinol during the prepa­
ration of its ethers has long been known.1 6  It is  
usually connected with methyl iodide or dimethyl  
sulfate alkylations. However, m-ethoxyphenol and  
m-n-butoxyphenol, prepared from resorcinol, potas­
sium hydroxide, and the appropriate alkyl bromide  
in aqueous ethanol, were free from ring-alkylated  
contaminants.
Base hydrolysis of m-ethoxyphenyl phenyl ether  
required a higher temperature than that needed for  
the methoxy compound. The n-butyl derivative  
could not be hydrolyzed by base without extensive  
decomposition.
Methods B and C were also investigated. Method  
B gave a 45% yield of m-phenoxyphenol. A 60%  
yield was obtained by method C. Both methods  
provided a route to the meta-linked ethers before  
the impurity problem connected with Method A  
was finally solved.
In preparations involving the Ullmann ether  
synthesis we have found that products prepared  
at 180-220° are generally purer than those pre­
pared at higher temperatures. Although the usual  
copper catalyst was used during most of this work,  
cuprous oxide was used in some instances and was  
quite as satisfactory. The long reaction times used  
by some earlier workers and, in part, ourselves  
are usually unnecessary. However, presence of  
impurities in starting materials or low reactivity

conditions. The reaction is quite rapid; even two  
hours at reaction temperature is possibly excessive  
in many cases.
A number of new compounds were prepared from  
p-a-cumylphenol. Although these products and  
those prepared from p-ieri-butylphenol lack the  
outstanding thermal and oxidation stability of the  
unsubstituted polyphenyl ethers, they are much  
more stable than present synthetic lubricants.2
The properties of the ethers prepared during  
this work are summarized in Table I.
As there is very little in the literature about  
these types of molecules, it was thought that a  
spectrum-structure correlation would be interest­
ing. The spectra are a composite of the spectra of  
ethers and polyphenyl structures, with the ex­
ception that most of the ethers in this study exhibit  
their benzene-oxygen stretch band near 1215 cm.-1  
rather than near 1250 cm.-1 as in vinyl and simple  
phenyl ethers. The absorption peaks that can be  
used to characterize the aryl ethers are given in  
the correlation chart in Table II.
The spectra were recorded on a Beckman IR-4  
spectrophotometer equipped with sodium chloride  
optics. The samples were run in carbon disulfide  
solutions between 7.5 and 15 p and in carbon tetra­
chloride solutions between 2 and 7.5 ju . A variable  
thickness cell was used to compensate for solvent  
absorption.
The compounds with an O—C (aliphatic) group  
have a strong band at 1040 ±  2 cm.-1 which is not  
present in any of the other spectra. This supports  
the contention of Briggs, et al.4  that the band near  
1040 cm.-1 rather than the 1120 cm.-1 band is due  
to the O—CH3  stretch vibration. The addition  
of bromine in the para-substituted compounds  
gives rise to a strong, sharp band at 822 ±  3 cm.-1  
and 1006 cm.-1. Stojilkovic and Whiffen9  mention  
that these bands are difficult to assign, but that the  
bands do indicate the presence of para-halogen  
substitution in aryl ethers. Characteristic absorp­
tion for mono-, meta-  and para-substitution is  
found in the 860 cm.-1 region. Two unique strong  
bands at 1132 ±  8 cm.-1 and 977 ±  2 cm.-1 are  
present only in 1,3-diaryloxybenzenes.
One of the strongest bands is due to the benzene-  
oxygen stretching mode. The majority of the  
samples have the band within the limits 1218 ±

10 cm.-1 which is lower than the values reported  
by Bellamy3  and by Briggs, et al.  but higher than  
those reported for vinyl ethers by Mikawa.9  Thus  
the range quoted by Bellamy for the benzene-oxy­
gen stretch frequency should be extended from  
1230-1270 to 1210-1270 cm -1 .
Monosubstituted aryl ethers have their strong  
band near 1240 cm .-1  but the addition of an  
oxygen to the ortho  position moves the band to  
1250 cm-1. However, meta-  or para-substitution  
shifts the band to near 1215 cm-1.
Other bands, some almost as intense as those  
above, can be used for characterization. Ortho-  
and para-disubstitution results in a band at 1190  
±  10 cm.-1 which is not present in the spectra of  
meta  compounds. A strong, broad meta  band ap­pears near 1270 cm.-1 and is very characteristic  
of this type of substitution.
The strong meta  band near 1214 cm.-1 is in­
teresting. Even when the number of m-substituted  
rings increases from sample to sample (III, VIII,  
XI) the frequency does not change by more than  
one wave number. Thus for 1,3-disubstitution in  
aryl ethers, the frequency is depressed considerably  
below the limits for m-substitution set by Colthup.8

The infrared spectrum of solid trichloroisocyanuric acid is interpreted as confirming the keto structure la of Chattaway 
and Wadmore. The 650— 900 cm.-1 region of thirteen A-chloroamides and of some of their congeners was examined. All the 
chlorinated cyanuric acids and benzenesulfonamide derivatives studied as well as l,3-dichIoro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin con­
tained a band between 762 and 803 cm.-1 which is probably essentially an N-Cl stretching frequency. Compounds con­
taining N-Cl attached to more weakly electronegative groups, such as A-chlorosuccmimide and N-chloroacetamide, did 
not have such a band. The preparation of some halogen derivatives of cyanuric acid is described.
As part of a program of examining solid com­
pounds for bleaching activity we have run the in­
frared spectra of a number of M-chloroamides. 
The main object has been to build a library of 
reference spectra for identification purposes, but 
we have studied some of them in detail when struc­
tural questions arose, and have sought new spectra- 
structure correlations.
Early in the work it became of practical impor­
tance to know whether crystalline trichloroisocy­
anuric acid (I) was, as Chattaway and Wadmore4  
believed, all in the keto form la, or whether it was 
in some tautomeric form such as lb or Ic, or was a 
mixture of two or more such forms.

thermodynamically. Nevertheless, in the absence 
of physical evidence for the location of the chlorine 
atoms, no definite conclusion could be reached.
No physical evidence for the location of the 
chlorine in any chloroamide has been found in the 
literature. However, the infrared spectra of six 
bromoamides reported by Lacher, Olson, and Park5  
were in accord with a keto-N-bromo structure, and 
a number of amides not containing positive halo­
gen, including cyanuric acid, have been shown6 ’ 7  
to be completely in the keto form in the solid state 
by both x-ray and infrared studies.
The infrared spectrum of crystalline trichloro­
isocyanuric acid (Fig. 1  and Table I) turned out to 
be surprisingly simple, as it exhibited only six well- 
defined bands. In a twelve-atom molecule, this 
scarcity of bands indicates a symmetrical and 
probably a planar structure, and favors structure 
la or Ic over forms such as lb. The strong band near 
1740 cm.“ 1  must be due to carbonyl absorption and 
the shift in its frequency from 1710 cm.-1 hi cya­
nuric acid6  is in the direction expected. The fre­
quency in cyanuric acid may be lowered by hydro­
gen bonding which is not possible for I, and it seems 
reasonable for an average of one chlorine substitu­
ent alpha  to the carbonyl, and probably in the 
same plane, to raise the C = 0  stretching frequency

by 25-30 cm.-18 The strong doublet at 1335 and 
1360 cm.-1 and the weak band at 1154 cm.-1 re­
semble fairly closely the main ring-stretching bands6  
of cyanuric acid, which has a strong band at 1470 
cm.-1 and a weak doublet at 1050 and 1065 cm-1.  
s-Triazine differs greatly, having ring stretching 
frequencies at 1556, 1410, and 675 cm.-19 Thus it 
seems almost certain that trichloroisocyanuric 
acid has structure la in the solid state.
The two remaining strong bands at 698 and 800 
cm.-1 are more difficult to explain. The former is, 
perhaps fortuitously, similar to an unidentified 
band at 695 cm.-1 in cyanuric acid and no assign­
ment can be made for it at present. The 800 cm.-1 
band is probably not related to the weak 807 cm.“ 1

be due to N-Cl stretching. The few known N-Cl 
bands have rather lower frequencies, viz. NH2 C 1,

but certain substituents on the nitrogen should 
cause an increase in an N-Cl stretching frequency.

bands found in the 650-900 cm.-1 are listed in 
Table II. Bands near 720 cm .-1  are unfortunately 
distorted or obscured by the Nujol peak in this 
region but no practical way of avoiding the use of 
the oil was found (see Experimental).
The spectra of six cyanuric acid derivatives are 
presented in Figs. 1-3. The N-Cl compounds all have 
a medium intensity band near 800 cm.-1, which is 
at 800 cm .-1  in trichloroisocyanuric acid, shifts to 
787-790 cm .-1  in dichloroisocyanuric acid (II) 
and its sodium and potassium salts, but is absent 
in potassium dibromoisocyanurate. In the anhy­
drous sodium salt this band has split into a 789, 
803 cm .-1  doublet, rather weaker than the single 
band in the dihydrate. In Figs. 1  and 2 I, noth three 
N-Cl bonds, has a stronger peak, relative to the 
carbonyl stretching band, than II, which has only 
two N-Cl bonds. It seems likely that the N-Cl 
stretching frequencies for these chlorinated cyanuric 
acid derivatives he between 785 and 803 cm .-1 .
Comparison of the spectra of four aromatic 
sulfonamides with those of their N-chloro deriva­
tives (Figs. 4 and 5) reveals that all the bands pre­
sent in the 650-900 cm._1 region of each sulfonamide 
seem to be present (slightly shifted) in the cor­
responding N-Cl compound. In addition, each 
chloro compound has a band between 762 and 782 
cm.-1, probably an N-Cl stretching frequency; 
three of them also exhibit another band hi the 744- 
800 cm .-1  region, which may be a second N-Cl 
band, namely p-(dichlorosulf amyl) benzoic acid 
(755 cm.-1, Fig. 4), N,N,N',Ar,-tetrachlorotoluene-

In the hydantoins (Fig. 6) the two possessing 
N-H groups have weak bands at 795-801 cm .-1

From the rather large range of the frequencies  
which have been assigned to N-Cl stretching, it is  
obvious that the vibrations responsible are by no  
means localized completely in the N-Cl group.  
Motions of the other groups attached to nitrogen  
must be involved and the mass of such substituents  
ought to be an important factor. In the case of the  
chlorosulfonamides, other influences must be cancel­
ling out the effect of the large mass of the sulfur  
atom relative to carbon for the frequencies for  
N-Cl in the chlorosulfonamides to come out in the  
same range as some of those in chloroamides.
Electronic effects must be quite important, as  
it is striking that only those compounds with  
rather strongly electronegative substituents on the  
N-Cl group show N-Cl bands in the region studied.  
For instance, although both trichlorocyanuric  
acid and N-chlorosuccinimide contain the —CON­
OCO— group, the fact that this group is bound  
to a highly electronegative —NC1CONC1—■  group­
ing in the former but to the electropositive —CH2 -  
CH2 — •  group in the latter evidently results in a  
great difference in N-Cl frequency in the expected  
direction. On the other hand, it is surprising that  
the salts of dichloroisocyanuric acid have bands at  
only slightly lower frequencies than that of the  
parent acid.
Not much diagnostic use can be made of these  
empirical correlations at present. Fortunately,  
the presence of an N-Cl group in an amide can  
generally be readily detected iodometrically if it is  
assumed that the chlorine in chloroamides is always  
bound to nitrogen, a view which the foregoing  
evidence tends to support .

Infrared spectra.  The infrared spectra described were run 
as mulls in Nujol between sodium chloride discs except for 
the crystalline film curve of I (Fig. 1). The latter is the 
spectrum of ten thin layers of crystals on a silver chloride 
disc deposited by rapid evaporation of successive drops of a 
fresh dilute solution of I in acetonitrile; a silver chloride 
disc was in the reference beam. No inert solvent capable of 
dissolving all the compounds of interest is known, and dis­
persions of N-Cl compounds in potassium bromide and 
potassium chloride pressed discs invariably gave spectra 
differing considerably from mull spectra. Decomposition 
was occurring in some cases, as the pellets sometimes de­
veloped orange (potassium bromide) or green (potassium 
chloride) colors. Deposition of crystalline films from solu­
tion without decomposition was not always possible, and, 
with dichloroisocyanuric acid, the spectra of films on silver 
chloride differed both from films on sodium chloride and 
(Bios Laboratories). We thank the companies mentioned for 
gifts of: A, A, A'', AT'-tetrachlorotoluen 2-2,4-disulfonamide

A reinvestigation of the kinetics and mechanism of the aqueous peroxydisulfate oxidation of 2-propanol has been carried 
out by two different experimental techniques. The direct interaction of the reagents can be studied only after oxygen in­
hibition and trace metal catalysis are eliminated. Mechanistic pathways for the reaction are discussed, and free radical 
chain sequences consistent with the data are presented.
The kinetics of the oxidation of alcohols by  
peroxydisulfate ion have been studied several  
times1  2 3 “6  but the results have not led to a satisfactory  
understanding of the reaction mechanism. In order  
to clarify the points of disagreement to be found  
in the literature and particularly to test the mech­
anisms postulated by Levitt4  5 ’6  the present studies1  
were carried out, primarily on 2-propanol as the  
reductant.
E X P E R IM E N T A L
Materials.  Two samples of 2-propanol were used with 
identical results. One sample, Eastman Spectro-Grade, was 
used without purification; the other, Union Carbide and 
Carbon 99%, was purified by refluxing over calcium oxide 
followed by distillation. The potassium peroxydisulfate, 
B &  A Reagent Special Grade, was initially used without 
purification; careful recrystallization from conductivity 
water caused a significant decrease in rate (see below). 
Other materials including Na2 H2 Y (the disodium salt of 
ethylenediaminetetraeetic acid) were best grade available 
and were used without further purification. The early ex­
periments were carried out with good quality distilled 
water; some later experiments were rim with conductivity’  
water.
Titration runs.  Two methods for following the reaction 
were employed. The first method was by iodometric anal­
ysis of unchanged peroxydisulfate. As the reaction proceeds 
at a convenient rate, standard procedures for pipetting and 
analyzing aliquots were employed.
Spectrophotometric runs.  Because of several difficulties 
(nonlinear plots, oxygen interference, catastrophes, etc.) 
which will be discussed below, it was desirable to find an 
alternative method for following the kinetics of this reaction. 
A spectrophotometric method was developed which involved 
the continuous measurement of absorbance at 2725 A 
versus time with ‘ .he Beckman DK-1 Recording Spectro­
photometer. This wavelength was picked zo give maximum 
change in absorbance during the course of a run. Acetone 
has a broad, rather weak absorption band centered at 2640 
A, while peroxydisulfate absorbs in a continuum from about 
3600 A out to beyond 2000 A. With an initial peroxide con­
centration of 0.054/ and a five-fold excess of alcohol (non­
absorbing) a change in absorbance (A = log /<>//) from

reaction. Normally the recorder was run at a chart speed 
of 0.5 inches per min. However, it was possible to interrupt 
a kinetic run at any point and rapidly scan the entire ultra­
violet spectrum.
The early spectrophotometric experiments were made 
using a phosphate-sulfate buffer of pH 8.0 and ionic strength 
0.5 as Levitt and Malinowski4  had done. Comparable 
results were obtained, however, if the reaction were run in 
distilled water; thus the buffer was not employed in later 
runs. In all cases the reference solution was of the same 
composition as the reacting solution, with the omission of the 
peroxy’disulfate. Matched ground-glass stoppered silica cells 
of 10-mm. path length were employed.
In the runs in which it was desired to exclude oxygen, 
the peroxide solution was saturated with nitrogen gas by 
bubbling the solution at 25° in an external Pyrex vessel for 
2 hr. This 250-ml. vessel was equipped with a condenser 
jacket through which water from a constant temperature 
bath could be circulated to bring the solution up to tem­
perature prior to the beginning of the run. The calculated 
amount of alcohol was added through a self-sealing rubber 
stopper with a hypodermic syringe at zero time and the 
solution rapidly mixed with a magnetic stirrer. The solution 
was then pumped under nitrogen into the spectrophotometer 
cell, which was equipped with a ground-glass adapter, 
allowing the cell to be thoroughly rinsed by' several cell 
volumes of the reacting solution and filled without con­
tacting the air. The solution remaining in the external vessel 
was used to follow the kinetics simultaneously by iodometric 
titration.
Temperatures within the spectrophotometer were main­
tained to ±0.5° by means of a thermostated cell holder 
through which constant temperature water was circulated. 
The entire mixing and transfer procedure took less than 1  
min. A similar procedure was followed for the runs made in 
solutions saturated with oxygen. When the exclusion of air 
was not required, the solution of peroxydisulfate was allowed 
to come to temperature in the cell in the spectrophotometer. 
Alcohol was then added directly to the cell from a micro- 
pipette and the solution mixed by' shaking; this procedure 
required about 15 seconds.

Stoichiometry.  Yields of 88 ±  3% of acetone  
were isolated from the 2-propanol oxidation by pre­
cipitation of the ketone as its 2,4-dinitrophenyl-  
hydrazone. No other organic product could be found.  
In the ultraviolet spectra, an isosbestic point at  
2570 A persisted throughout the course of the re­
action. Within the experimental error of the spectral  
method (0.01 absorbance units, or about ±2%),  
this plus the change in absorbance at 2725 A con­

Titration runs.  A summary of kinetic experi­
ments at 40° are presented in Table I. Generally  
the reaction was followed over the course of one  
half-life, and in such cases the reaction appeared to  
be first order in peroxydisulfate concentration.  
However, in runs carried over more than one half-  
life, the first order plots showed a small but signifi­
cant sigmoid-shaped wiggle about the best straight  
line; this curvature, which was definitely outside  
the experimental error and will be mentioned later,  
is an indication of a complicated mechanism.
The possible effect of pH on the reaction was  
studied. Runs were made in solutions buffered by  
phosphate at pH 8 and in unbuffered solutions, in  
which the pH generally varied from 3 to 2 in the  
course of one half-life. Although there was a fairly  
wide variation (0.5 X 10-3 to 1  X -0~3  min.-1) in  
the values of the apparent first order rate constants  
at 40°, no significant dependence or. pH exists for  
the observed first order oxidation.
In their original study of the oxidation at 60°,  
Levitt and Malinowski4  used an initial concentra­
tion of 0.02.1/ for S2 0 8  and varied he initial con­
centration of R2 CHOH from 0 to 0.2.1/; a limiting  
first order rate was observed using an initial con­
centration of 0.05.1/ for RoCIIOH. In the present  
titration study at 40°, the initial concentration of  
SaO s was always 0.02.1/. When an initial concen­
tration of 0.024/ was used for R2 CH0H, there was  
no apparent reaction. Xo significant variation in  
the observed first order rate constant occurred  
when the initial concentration of R2 CHOH was  
varied from 0.42 to 0.83.1/.
A significant result of these data is the fact that  
the observed first order rate constants at 40° were  
sometimes less than the value predicted by Levitt  
and Malinowski (obtained using their observed  
value of 1.05 hr.-1 for the limiting first order rate  
constant at 60° and their reported value of 26  
kcal. mole for the Arrhenius activation energy).  
The kinetic studies of Levitt and Malinowski were  
made using reaction solutions containing rather  
large amounts (0.1.1/) of sulfate ion, to which  
those authors ascribed an inhibiting effect on therate of the oxidation. The fact that slower rates  
were observed in the present study, even though  
no sulfate ion was added to the reaction solutions,  
is particularly noteworthy. Also, in the presence  
of small amounts (4 X 10-4il/) of the powerful  
sequestering agent Na2 H2 Y the observed rate  
was markedly reduced; there was no apparent  
reaction during time intervals comparable to the  
time of one half-life in the absence of Na2 H2 Y.
In Fig. 1, data on the oxidation of three alcohols  
by peroxydisulfate ion are shown. Before the addi­
tion of Na2 H2 Y (shown by vertical bars) all three  
rates are identical within the experimental error;  
the first order rate constants are 2.1 X 10-3,
1.9 X 10-3, and 2.0 X 10-3 in units of min.-1 for  
methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol respectively.  
Also, these rates are not the same as those presented  
in Table I, for a different batch of buffer was  
employed. Although the rates after addition of  
Xa2 H;Y were too slow to be determined accurately,  
all three reactions are inhibited in the same way  
and to a similar degree by this sequestering agent.
Additional data, which were obtained at 50°,  
are presented in Table II; the results are similar  
to those obtained at 40°. It was observed, however,  
that tire peroxydisulfate ion reacts with Na2 H2 Y.  
At 50° in solutions buffered at pH 8, about 5% of  
the peroxydisulfate (in the absence of alcohol)  
reacted during the first three hours of the run;  
subsequently, the observed first order rate slowed  
down to a value equal to that observed in the ab­
sence of Na2 H2 Y. The first order rate constant  
(k = ca.  0.8 X 10-4 min.-1), observed at 50° at  
pH 8 in the absence of XaTLY, compares favorably  
with the value reported by Ivolthoff and Miller7  
(k = 0.87 X 10-4 min.-1 at pH 7 and at 50°) for  
the oxidation of water by peroxydisulfate ion. The  
rate of this oxidation has been shown7  not to be  
explicitly dependent on pH (except in strong acid)  
or ionic strength. Returning to the peroxydisulfate  
reaction with Xa-JLY, the initial concentration of  
Xa2 H2 Y was 0.0006.1/ compared with 0.02.1/ for  
S2 Os- - ;  it is suggested that two peroxydisulfate

ions reacted with one molecule of Na2 H2 Y. Possibly  
oxidation occurs at the two amino nitrogens of the  
Na2 H2 Y molecule8
At pH 8 in phosphate buffer, which contains no  
Na2 H2 Y, S2 0 3  oxidizes R2 CHOH rapidly. The  
oxidation appears to be first order in the concen­
tration of S2 0 8  . A value of 2.0 X 10-3 min.-1
for the first order rate constant was observed for  
the oxidation in the absence of Na2 H2 Y; the value  
for k predicted by the results of Levitt and Malinow­
ski is 5.3 X 10-3 min.-1
In the presence of Na2 H2 Y (6 X 10-4M), the  
oxidation proceeded slowly at first. These initial  
portions of the runs were plotted as first order in  
the concentration of S2 0 8- -  and the apparent rate  
constants listed in Table II. Variations in the initial  
concentration of R2 CIIOH from 0.22 to 0.88A/  
produced no apparent change in the indicated  
rate constant. However, after the passage of from  
three to six hours, a relatively rapid decrease ( ca. 5 
X 10-34/) in the concentration of S2 0 8  occurred.  
Subsequently, the oxidation readopted an apparent  
first order behavior, but the reaction was somewhat  
less rapid than before the “catastrophe.” Subse­
quent experiments, described below, revealed the  
cause of this behavior as interaction of dissolved  
oxygen with reaction intermediates.
Speclrophotometric data.  The problem of the pres­
entation of the experimental data obtained with the  
spectrophotometer is somewhat complicated by the  
complexity of the reaction. For this reason, the

below in an order which attempts to be systematic  
(rather than chronological). Pertinent tables of  
data are included as needed. A complete summary  
of the experimental runs is given elsewhere.lb
Effect of oxygen.  The most striking result obtained  
was the observation of a definite inhibition period,  
the length of which depended on the amount of  
dissolved oxygen present in the solution. When the  
solution was rigorously deprived of oxygen, a quite  
rapid reaction was observed which appeared pseudo-  
first-order in persulfate in the presence of a large  
excess of alcohol. When the reaction was run in the  
closed cell with solution which had been in equi­
librium with the air, a much slower reaction with a  
rate which remained apparently constant was ob­
served for a reproducible period of time lasting  
from 3 to 124 minutes (depending on conditions).  
At the end of this inhibition period there was a  
sudden significant increase in rate to the value  
found in the absence of oxygen, and pseudo-first-  
order kinetics ensued and continued until the com­
pletion of the reaction. When the reaction was run  
in a solution saturated with oxygen, the inhibition  
period continued until the persulfate was exhausted  
although after about one half-life the rate slowed  
down and approached higher order kinetics before  
completion. Spectrophotometer plots for these three  
cases in buffered solution at 60° are shown in Fig.
2. It is obvious from these results that at least two  
separate reactions are involved. For simplicity of  
discussion the slow, initial reaction involving oxy­
gen will be called reaction A; and the rapid re­
action which takes place in the absence of oxygen

will be referred to as reaction B. The sudden transi­
tion from A to B apparently corresponds to the ex­
haustion of dissolved oxygen. After reaction B had  
begun, simply removing the stopper from the spec­
trophotometer cell for a second to admit air, fol­
lowed by brief shaking, was sufficient to stop B and  
cause the rate of A to be reassumed.
The catastrophies found in the titration experi­
ments can be explained as the rapid increase in  
rate observed at the transition from reaction A to  
B upon the exhaustion of dissolved oxygen. This  
sudden transition is quite striking on the continuous  
curves obtained from the spectrophotometer. In  
the runs with distilled water this transition is even  
more sharp than for the buffered solution, although  
it was observed in both cases. The catastrophies  
were observed (as discontinuous gaps in the ti­
tration data) only when EDTA was present, as  
under these conditions the rate of disappearance of  
persulfate was sufficiently reduced for dissolved  
oxygen to become exhausted between infrequent  
titrations. This was possible as, even though EDTA  
greatly decreased the rate of loss of persulfate dur­
ing reaction A, it did not significantly affect the  
length of time required to exhaust the dissolved  
oxygen (see Table III). The implications of this  
observation will be considered later.
Comparison of methods.  It is known that persul­
fate ion can decompose by a photochemical re­
action to produce radicals, as well as by a thermal  
process.9  In order to show that photochemical de­
composition was not responsible for the complex  
kinetics observed in the spectrophotometer, the  
kinetics of the reaction in several runs were followed  
simultaneously by iodometric titrations of the solu­
tion remaining in the external thermostated cell.  
Care was taken to minimize the introduction of  
oxygen during sampling. Curves showing the re­
sults obtained by the two methods are given in  
Fig. 3. The curves labeled I were obtained from the *  3 4 0

same solution, in the presence of an excess of  
oxygen. The curves labeled T I were obtained from  
another solution, which had been purged of most  
of its dissolved oxygen with nitrogen gas. Notice  
that the transition from reaction A to reaction B  
occurs at the same time in the external sample as in  
the sample receiving ultraviolet radiation in the  
spectrophotometer. Slight differences in the con­
centrations detected by the two methods are to  
be expected, as quenching of the reaction solution  
for the titrations was insufficiently fast compared to  
the rate of the fast reaction B. Also, despite pre­
cautions, oxygen seems to have been introduced  
into the titration experiment before completion.  
It is obvious, however, that the same major ki­
netic process is being monitored in both cases, and  
that the effects observed are not due to photo­
chemical initiation of persulfate decomposition  
within the spectrophotometer.
From the comparison discussed in this section  
and from the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3, one  
definite conclusion can be drawn. The rates ob­
served in the titration experiments were (excepting,  
of course, the catastrophies) those for reaction A.  
Therefore, the conclusions drawn from the results

Reaction A orders.  Reaction A is observed 
only in the presence of dissolved oxygen gas. A plot 
of absorbance vs. time is linear over as much as one 
half-life (see Fig. 2), making the reaction appear 
initially zero order in all reactants. At longer 
reaction time, however, the reaction slows down, 
approaching higher order kinetics. By varying the 
initial concentration of each component, the re­
action was zero order in alcohol and zero order in 
oxygen, but not zero order in persulfate. The ini­
tially constant rate vs. time is then an indication of 
a complex reaction.
The usable absorbance range of the spectropho­
tometer so limited the range over which the initialpersulfate concentration could be varied that it was 
difficult to define definitely the order with respect 
to persulfate concentration by this method. As 
mentioned earlier, if the titration data for the re­
action A are plotted as first order (see Fig. 4), the 
resulting curve, which is reasonably fitted by the 
dotted straight line, actually has a soft sigmoid 
shape. This sigmoid shape was observed in spectro- 
photometric runs as well as titration runs. The 
spectrophotometric method, by providing a con­
tinuous curve rather than scattered points, em­
phasizes the deviations from linearity, which are 
definitely greater than the experimental error. 
Further discussion of this nonlinearity will be post­
poned until after the evidence for mechanistic com­
plexities has been discussed.

Trace metal catalysis.  The effect of EDTA on the 
rate is considered to be due to sequestration of trace 
metal impurities which exert a catalytic influence. 
Although it was observed that persulfate reacts 
slowly with higher concentrations of EDTA, 
probably by oxidation at nitrogen,8  the inhibiting 
effect observed here with traces of EDTA is attrib­
uted to sequestration of trace metal catalysts 
rather than reaction with EDTA, as traces of sub­
stances with similar functional groups, but no 
strong chelating ability, gave no retardation of rate 
(see Table III).
In an attempt to discover the ion or ions respon­
sible for the trace metal catalysis, a series of trace 
impurities were intentionally introduced into re­
acting solutions, and their effect on the rate of re­
action A observed. From the series of ions—Ag+, 
Ce+4 , Co+2 , Cr+3 , Cu+2 , Fe+2 , Fe+3 , Hg+2 , 
Mg+2 , Mn+2 , Ni+2 , Sn+4 , and Zn+2 —added so 
that their concentrations were approximately 
10 M, only Cu+2  was observed to exert a notice­
able catalytic effect. While this does not prove that 
Cu+2  is the only catalyst involved, it is certainly 
the most effective one observed. The presence of 
catalytic impurities was confirmed upon purification 
of the potassium peroxydisulfate by several re- 
crystallizations from conductivity water. This 
reduced the initial rate of reaction A to a value 
approaching that observed in the presence of 
EDTA. Using recrystallized potassium peroxydi­
sulfate, the initial rate of reaction A was then 
measured as a function of added Cu+2  ion. The data 
are summarized in Table IV. Assuming that Cu+2  isthe impurity which is removed by the recrystalli­
zations, the data allow estimates of the amount of 
Cu+2  originally present. Solutions of the unre- 
crystallized persulfate correspond to an added cop­
per concentration of 10-6i/. One recrystalliza­
tion from conductivity water reduced the rate to 
that observed in the presence of 1 0 «  M Cu+2 , 
while two recrystallizations reduced the rate al­
most to that observed in the presence of EDTA.

gent bottle, if attributed entirely to copper, is of 
the right order of magnitude to account for the ob­
served impurities. Other cases of trace copper 
catalysis in persulfate reactions are known.1 2 -1 5

Fig. 5. A typical spectrophotometer trace at 2725 A showing reaction A, reaction B, the 
induction period t, and the initial angle a
than two. This indicates that the catalytic effect  
of Cu+ 2  reaches an upper limiting value at ap­
proximately 10 ~4  M. Reaction A must be zero  
order in copper ion above this concentration. This  
can account for the fact that previous workers have  
reported comparable rate constants, as at a Cu+2  
concentration as low as 10-6 to 10~5  M, the rate is  
insensitive to small changes in copper concentra­
tion, although the small amount present has a very  
significant catalytic effect.
The length and rate of reaction A.  A typical spec­
trophotometer trace is shown in Fig. 5 for a run  
at 60.0° in unbuffered solution using thrice re­
crystallized persulfate. Air is initially present, and  
the initial concentrations of persulfate and 2-  
propanol are 0.049 M and 0.39 M, respectively.  
The maximum rate of reaction A, observed in the  
presence of added Cu+2 , is indicated by the dashed  
line. There are two important variables which were  
measurable for reaction A as it was normally ob­
served on the spectrophotometer trace. The  
first is the length of time elapsed between the addi­
tion of alcohol and the sudden increase in rate at  
the onset of reaction B. This corresponds to the  
length of time required to use up the dissolved  
oxygen. This time will be referred to as the length  
of the inhibition period, and identified by the  
symbol r. There was negligible air space above the  
solution in the stoppered spectrophotometer cells,  
and for short r  the rate of diffusion of additional  
oxygen, as it dissolved, may be ignored. Hence, for  
a given set of conditions, r  is a measure of the origi­
nal concentration of dissolved oxygen. Conversely,  
for a given original concentration of dissolved oxy­
gen, r  is inversely proportional to the rate at which  
oxygen is consumed. The second variable is thetangent of the angle a produced by the recorder  
trace with the horizontal. For measurements made  
at identical initial persulfate concentration, this  
value is proportional to the initial rate of reaction A.  
The factors affecting these two variables were  
studied.
Let us first consider r. Table III shows that it is  
essentially independent of added EDTA. It in­
creased slightly in the presence of the maximum  
effective concentration of Cu+2 . It was inversely  
related to the initial alcohol concentration as  
shown in Fig. 6. This effect reached a limiting value  
at high alcohol concentration. As might be expected,  
it was strongly dependent on temperature, as this  
affected not only the rate of loss of oxygen, but  
also the solubility of oxygen. The observed data  
are presented in Table Y. It was also observed  
that r was as much as twice as long in buffered solu­
tion as in unbuffered; the reason for this is not  
completely clear.

The second variable, the initial rate of reaction 
A, was strongly dependent on the presence of 
EDTA or traces of Cu+ 2  as has already been dis­
cussed. The initial rate was independent of oxygen 
concentration. This may be seen in Figs. 2 and 3, 
as the initial rates are identical for different initial 
concentrations of dissolved oxygen. The sharp 
discontinuity in the spectrophotometer traces 
upon the exhaustion of dissolved oxygen provides 
additional evidence that the rate is independent 
of dissolved oxygen concentration until it is 
completely used up.
The initial rate was also independent of alcohol 
concentration, above 0.04M, as demonstrated by 
the data of Table VI. This zero order behavior is 
consistent with the data of Tables I and II and 
with the findings of previous workers4 '5  under 
conditions where oxygen was not excluded. Al­
though there is scatter in the measured initial 
rate values, there is clearly no rate dependence of 
the type of a kinetic order on alcohol concentra­
tion. Furthermore, this result predicts that the 
rate of reaction A should be independent of the 
nature of the alcohol; this was found in the ex­
periments presented in Fig. 1.
The temperature dependence of the initial rate 
of A is included in Table V. It corresponds to an 
apparent activation energy of 18 kcal./mole. As 
1/r is proportional to the rate at which dissolved 
oxygen is consumed, an approximate value for 
the activation energy of the reaction by which 
oxygen is lost may also be calculated. Although theTABLE VI

solubility of dissolved oxygen varies with tempera­
ture, there was probably insufficient time for equi­
librium solubility to be reached. The calculation 
was therefore made assuming identical initial oxy­
gen concentration, regardless of temperature. A 
value of 25 to 27 kcal./mole was obtained from the 
resulting, approximately linear Arrhenius plot.
From the evidence which has just been pre­
sented, it may be seen that these two variables, 
r and tangent a, which are related to the oxygen 
inhibition and the Cu+ 2  catalysis, respectively, are 
in some ways independent. The reaction with dis­
solved oxygen, which blocks the rapid reaction B, 
is not affected by the presence or absence of Cu+2  
catalysis. The presence of oxygen, however, seems

to be necessary for the metal catalysis, as reaction 
B is unaffected by Cu+ 2  or EDTA. There must be 
two reaction paths in reaction A. When the metal 
catalyzed path is removed by EDTA, the residual 
reaction—call it A o—is simply the reaction by 
which dissolved oxygen is lost. Since the presence of 
Cu+ 2 catalysis does not shorten r, the catalysis 
must proceed by a mechanism which does not in­
troduce intermediates capable of increasing the 
rate of consumption of oxygen. This places rather 
stringent restrictions on the type of mechanisms 
which can be considered for reactions A and A o. 
Unfortunately, neither EDTA nor recrystallization 
completely removed the influence of metal ions on 
the value of a, for this angle never decreased to the 
value predicted from the intrinsic rate of decom­
position of persulfate. Therefore, in order to draw 
conclusions about reaction A0 , we limited our­
selves to the information obtained from r values.
Reaction B kinetics.  Reaction B takes place only 
in the absence of oxygen. The introduction of a 
minute amount of oxygen into the reaction cell 
after B began immediately stopped B and the 
slower reaction A began again. As earlier workers 
apparently did not exclude oxygen, the kinetics 
of this reaction between persulfate and 2-propanol 
have not previously been studied.
Addition of EDTA or recrystallization of per­
sulfate had no significant effect on the rate of 
reaction B as may be noted from the data of Table
III. In experiments designed to test the influence 
of Cu+ 2  on the rate of reaction B, three runs withFig. 8. Order plot demonstrating the dependence of the 
rate of reaction B on alcohol concentration
0, 10-6, and 10~4  M Cu+2  added were carried out 
with twice-recrystallized persulfate and de-ionized 
water. The rate constants obtained were 1.08,
1.07, and 1.06 l., y Vmole~1 /,/min.-1, the variation 
observed therein is less than the expected error 
(see below).
The reaction appears pseudo-first-order in per­
sulfate over four or five half lives when run in the 
presence of a large excess of alcohol. Pseudo-first- 
order rate plots for reaction B are shown in Fig. 7. 
The excellent linearity of the lines over 90% of the 
reaction confirms the order in persulfate. The ob­
served rate constants are a function of the initial 
alcohol concentrations, however. By varying the 
initial alcohol concentration over a ten-fold range 
at constant initial persulfate concentration, the 
order in alcohol was shown to be one-half; some 
data are presented in Table VI. This one-half 
order behavior is demonstrated graphically in 
Fig. 8. The rate law for reaction B is therefore
d[S2 Or_Z j  = /fc [S 2 Oa— ][R2 CHOH]‘ A at
The apparent activation energy of reaction B 
was determined from runs at 45°, 50°, 60°, 65°, 
and 70° with the data presented in Table V. 
Within the experimental error, a linear Arrhenius 
plot was obtained, with a slope corresponding to 
an activation energy of 21 kcal./mole.
After our first trials dealing with the effect of
1 6 0 8 BALL, CRUTCHFIELD, AND EDW ARDSv o l . 2 5
gases on rate, a procedure designed to minimize 
the diffusion of oxygen into the cell was worked 
out. Using this procedure, twenty-eight experi­
ments at 60° giving values (from initial slopes) of 
the three-halves order rate constants were carried 
out. Values for initial rate constants between 0.70 
and 1.08 l.1 /2 /mole_,/2/min._1 were obtained for 
twenty-six experiments; the other two were 
somewhat low (0.50 and 0.52), which suggests that 
oxygen was not completely excluded in these 
cases. The average constant and the average devia­
tion for the twenty-six experiments was 0.91 
± 0.09 in units of l.,/,/mole~1 /,,/min.-1 Although 
these rate constants from initial slopes of the B- 
part are not quite as accurate as those of Fig. 7 
and 8, they show that the variation in kt/, is 
encouragingly small for such a complicated system; 
also, the inhibition period r was never completely 
eliminated. However, the observed value of fc a /, did 
not depend on the length of the inhibition period.
Comparison of reaction rates.  Before proceeding 
to a discussion of possible mechanisms for these 
reactions, it will be helpful to make a summary 
comparison of the relative rates of all the reactions 
involved. This is given in Table VII below. The 
rates are based on the thermal decomposition of 
persulfate as unity. To make them consistent, 
they refer to initial rates which have been cor­
rected to standard conditions of temperature and 
reactant concentrations. Due to changes in buffer, 
pH, trace impurities, etc. from one observer 
to another, the rate ratios may be expected to be 
only approximate. The fact that previous work 
lay in the range of the oxygen-inhibited, copper- 
catalyzed reaction is unmistakable, however.

Points of contention.  Before the actual mech­
anistic steps for this oxidation reaction can bediscussed, certain points of disagreement in the 
literature must be resolved. It is the purpose of 
this section to go over the evidence in order to 
arrive at a satisfactory conclusion on each point.
In this study, two previously unreported kinetic 
factors have been uncovered. The first of these is 
the catalysis up to a limiting rate of the persulfate- 
alcohol reaction by traces of copper ion. The evi­
dence for this catalysis may be summarized as 
follows: a) Small amounts of Na2 H2 Y markedly 
slowed down the rates (in the A part) whereas com­
parable amounts of weakly coordinating reagents 
such as glycine or triethylamine had no effect on 
the rate, b) two recrystallizations of the potassium 
persulfate from conductivity water resulted in a 
decrease in rate approaching that observed in the 
presence of Na2 H2 Y, and c) addition of small 
amounts of copper ion caused a large increase in 
the rate when recrystallized persulfate was used.
The other factor, oxygen inhibition, is demon­
strated by the following pieces of evidence: a) 
the sudden change in rate at the end of the A part 
is evidence for depletion of an inhibitor, b) the 
length of time of the A part (r) varied directly with 
the initial oxygen concentration, c) shaking air 
into the cell after the B part has started causes 
the B part to cease and a new part A to begin, 
and d) the oxygen inhibition mechanism postu­
lated below predicts a length of time for part A 
that agrees satisfactorily with the observed length.
It seems certain that the oxidation of alcohols 
by peroxydisulfate ion is a free radical reaction. 
In view of the fact that a polar mechanism has 
been put forth,4 ’ 6  the evidence for the radical mech­
anism is worth reiterating: a) The rate of reaction 
is a sensitive function of the experimental condi­
tions, b) the reaction is inhibited by oxygen which 
is normal for a chain reaction involving an organic 
radical, c) peroxydisulfate ion is known7 '9  to 
decompose by a radical mechanism, d) allyl acetate 
lowers the rate of loss of peroxydisulfate in the 
presence of alcohol to that observed for its free 
radical decomposition6  thus no path independent 
of sulfate ion radicals can be present, e) Cu++ 
ion influences the rate of part A reaction, f) a 
one-half order as in the 2-propanol concentration 
dependence of the part B reaction is a character­
istic of a radical reaction, and g) changes in order 
as concentrations vary4  are found where several 
termination steps can compete.
One question which has been raised heretofore 
now seems answered: There seems to be no signifi­
cant interaction of alcohol and peroxydisulfate 
in the initiation step. The reasons behind this 
conclusion are as follows: a) The overall order of the 
part B reaction is three-halves whereas it would 
have to be two if a bimolecular reaction constituted 
the initiation step, b) the rates of part A reactions 
are insensitive to alcohol concentration and to 
alcohol nature, c) the rate of loss of persulfate in

the presence of alcohol and allyl acetate agrees 
with the known decomposition rate for peroxy- 
disulfate ion alone,5  and d) no evidence for a 
bimolecular initiation step was found in the studies 
of Kolthoff, Meehan, and Carr3  or of Bawn and 
Margerison.1 6
The present study and that of Wiberg5  have 
brought forth considerable evidence which is 
contrary to the ionic mechanism postulated by 
Levitt for the peroxydisulfate oxidation of 2- 
propanol.4 ’ 6  Some experimental points bearing on 
this matter are worth mentioning, a) There is no 
dependence of rate on sulfate ion concentration 
which would bear out the inverse first order de­
pendence required by his mechanism, b) There has 
not been any evidence for a thermal peroxydisul- 
fate-sulfate sulfur exchange5 - 9 '1 7  as required by 
his mechanism, c) The experimental observations 
of rate inhibition by allyl acetate5  and by oxygen 
are positive proof that the rate constants found 
by Levitt must have arisen from a free-radical 
initiated mechanism. Any polar mechanism would 
be unaffected by these additives, d) Similarly the 
copper ion catalysis and the Na2 H2 Y inhibition are 
evidence against a polar displacement mechanism 
of oxidation. In view of the evidence, the mech­
anisms of Levitt4 -6  for the persulfate oxidation of
2-propanol must be considered incorrect. Indeed, 
the general applicability of any mechanism directly 
or indirectly involving a reversible, heterolytic 
reaction of persulfate such as proposed by Levitt 
for the oxidation of other substrates6  also must be 
seriously questioned.
While we reject the mechanistic proposals of 
Levitt, we feel it is important to point out that 
the experimental data are not being questioned. 
Levitt and Malinowski4  report and our results con­
firm that the reaction is zero order in alcohol con­
centration (when oxygen is present, of course). 
Also some of the kinetic plots of their latest paper 
seem to show the same soft sigmoid character that 
we have observed. Finally, the values for the first 
order rate constants which they reported are in 
the range of those rates we have observed for the 
A part of the reaction. For example we obtained 
initial rate values of 4.85 X 10~4  and 13.3 X 10~4  
mole/l._1/min.-! for runs with no added copper and 
with 5 X 10 ~5  M cupric ion respectively, under a 
set of conditions (60°, [S2 0 8  ] = 0.04854/, [R2 -
CHOH] = 0.396M) for which the data of Levitt 
and Malinowski predict an initial rate value of
9.05 X 10~4 . Evidently, they never exhausted the 
oxygen supply nor did they remove the trace 
amounts of copper present in their reagents, and 
thus always observed the A portion of the reaction.

are surprisingly cleancut in that there are few kinetic

with reaction B which seems to be the least com­
plicated part, the postulated chain mechanisms is

R»COH +  SOw - X  R2 CO +  H S O r 
This predicts the rate law
R = [S2 0 8— ][R2 CHOH]'A
in agreement with the observed expression. Since 
we have found that the chain length is greater than 
one thousand (see Table VII), the activation 
energies for fa, fa,  and fa should be small; one 
predicts that the overall activation energy for the 
chain should lie between 4 / 2 Ei and Ex where Ei is 
the activation energy of the fa step and has a 
value of about 31 kcal./mole-1.7 -1 6  Our observed 
activation energy is 21 kcal./mole-1, which is in 
good accord. Also, the rate constant observed for 
the B part should depend on the nature of the 
alcohol, as the ease of carbon-hydrogen bond break­
ing in the fa step would be expected to increase with 
methyl substitution on the carbinol carbon. Here 
again the agreement is excellent, for the rate of 
loss of persulfate in the B part is a factor of forty 
lower when methanol is oxidized than when 2-pro­
panol is oxidized.lb
Rate inhibition by allyl acetate5  and by oxygen 
must involve trapping of the radicals which carry 
the chain in the mechanism of part B. As persulfate 
has been reported to initiate polymerization of 
vinyl compounds through the sulfate ion radical,1 8  
it seems reasonable that allyl acetate reacts with 
the sulfate ion radical. Inhibition by oxygen, on 
the other hand, must involve the reducing radical 
R2 COH.
For the data of part A for the case of no contri­
bution from metal ion catalysis, we postulate the 
following steps:
o 2 +  r2c o h  X -  o o r 2c o h
■OOR2 COH +  R2 CHOH — > HOORoCOH +  R,COH
2 00R 2 C0H X  0 2  +  HOORoCOH +  R2 CO
The inhibition by oxygen can be traced to a very 
high rate constant for fa coupled with a low fa 
reactivity so that the peroxidic radicals build up 
in sufficient concentration to terminate the chain 
in the fa step. Such steps and their reactivities are

Application of steady state treatment to the 
sequence ki,k2 ,k6 ,ke,  and k7 leads to the rate law
= *,[S2 0 8— ] +  ks ( | ) ' A [S2 Ot— ][R2 CHOH]
for the take-up of dissolved oxygen. As the inhi­
bition period r is related to the reciprocal of the rate, 
this law predicts that the value of r should be re­
lated to the amount of oxygen initially present but 
not dependent on oxygen concentration as a ki­
netic order. The dependence on alcohol concentra­
tion also is as expected, for r does decrease as 
alcohol concentration increases.
Using the step ki and the oxygen solubility in 
water for both of which we have values from the 
literature, one can compute an inhibition time 
using the mechanistic sequence, kifafa,  and 
k7 . For one experiment with an observed r value of 
seventeen minutes, the calculated value was sixty 
minutes; considering that k6 which would lower the 
t value was not taken into account, the agreement 
is good.
It is worth noting here that step k6 demands a 
dependence of slope a for reaction A o on both con­
centration and nature of alcohol. This was not ob­
served as we were never able to eliminate com­
pletely the metal ion catalysis rate which swamps 
out A o  because of its greater magnitude.
It would indeed be difficult to postulate a mech­
anism for the metal-catalyzed portion of the re­
action but for the fact that the experimental data 
narrow down the number of possibilities. Criteria 
which must be satisfied in any mechanism postu­
lated for the metal-catalyzed case include the fol­
lowing: a) The rate becomes independent of copper 
ion concentration above 10 ~4  M, b) the rate is 
independent of alcohol concentration or nature 
above 0.05 M, c) the inhibition time is not shortened 
(r increases somewhat as copper concentration in­
creases), d) some reactive species (from oxygen 
interaction?) other than those of the part B re­
action must initiate the metal-catalyzed reaction 
as the part B rate is not affected by added copper 
or by added Na2 H2 Y, and e) no new free radicals 
can be formed.
We postulate the following steps:

Cuo +  S2 0 8— — > Cu + 2  +  2SO<—In this sequence, step ks provides an entry into a 
cyclic redox chain involving Cu+ and Cu+3. 
Steps kg and kw constitute the nonradical propaga­
tion steps which carry the main oxidation of alcohol 
in reaction A. Step kn , which is the disproportiona­
tion of cuprous ion, acts as a chain termination 
step. The step kn is postulated as a means of re­
turning Cu° to Cu+2  without the formation of 
radicals.
The disproportionation reaction of cuprous ion 
(step kn ) is well known in aqueous solution.2 0  2 1  
The oxidation of zero valent copper to cupric 
ion (step k n ) is also known.1 1  Knowledge of the 
tripositive oxidation state of copper is admittedly 
limited; the evidence has been summarized by 
Sneed, Maynard and Brasted2 1  and Latimer2 2  
has given approximate oxidation potentials. Of 
particular pertinence to the presence study is the 
fact that a series of complex salts containing tri­
positive copper have been prepared by persulfate 
oxidation.2 3  If these steps are combined with others 
already considered, the following rate law for the 
case cf maximum copper-catalysis rate is derived:
R = ( U A  faoISiO ,—]■ /.
This rate law predicts a rate which is independent 
of alcohol and of metal in agreement with the ex­
perimental results. Further it suggests an explana­
tion for the sigmoidal shape of the first order plots 
of part A. Often in reactions where intermediates 
are present, a finite time is required to reach the 
steady state concentration. Thus, the initial por­
tion of the reaction indicates an autocatalysis. 
Toward the other end, however, the first order rate 
constant should fall off if the true order is greater 
than one. This combination of an initial build-up 
in intermediate concentration and a final order of 
three-halves can therefore give a first order plot 
that has a sigmoid appearance.
One surprising aspect of the experimental re­
strictions is that practically no alternative steps 
can be postulated for this reaction without con­
tradicting some piece of experimental information. 
Particularly, reactions of the type
S 208—  +  C u ++ — SOr- +  S 04—  +  C u + 3
which have been proposed to explain catalysis by 
other metal ions of persulfate oxidations1 6  must be 
excluded in our case. They predict a first order 
dependence on metal ion concentration, as well as 
produce additional SCtf radicals which would 
shorten t.

Dimethyl sulfide reacts with cholesteryl p-toluenesulfonate to give 3/S-dimethylsulfonio-5-cholestene p-toluenesulfonate. 
Cholesteryl p-toluenesulfonate and methanethiol yield chiefly 3/3-methylthio-5-cholestene together with small amounts of 
3a-methylthio-5-eholestene and 3,5-cyclo-6-methylthiocholestene. Reasons for the structural and stereochemical assignments 
are given and some reactions of the compounds are described.
During recent years a number of investigations 
have been directed toward introducing sulfur-con­
taining groups into natural steroids in order to 
study the effect of such substitution on physiologi­
cal activity. Cholesterol has been converted to 
5-cholestene-3 /3-thiol by reaction of cholesteryl p- 
toluenesulfonate with thiourea2  or potassium thio­
cyanate3 '4  followed by hydrolysis. The conversion 
of steroidal ketones to thioketones has been ac­
complished recently5 '6  and alkanethiolic acids and 
mercaptans have been added to appropriately un­
saturated steroidal ketones.7 '8
Our interest in sulfur-containing steroids stems 
from a broad investigation being carried out in these 
laboratories into the chemical9  1 0  1 1  and physiological 
properties of sulfur compounds, the sulfonium

current views on the stereochemistry of reactions" 
involving nucleophilic displacements in homo-

Thus it seemed to us, that mechanistically it 
was possible to achieve a direct synthesis of 30- 
dialkylsulfonio-5-cholestenes by the reaction of 
dialkvl sulfides with cholesteryl p-toluenesulfonate 
(Ib-»TIb). Indeed, this proved to be the case. In 
nitromethane as a solvent, dimethyl sulfide re­
acted with cholesteryl p-toluenesulfonate to yield 
30-dimethylsulfonio-5-cholestene p-toluenesulfonate

3/3-Methylthio-5-cholestene (III) has been pre­
pared by the alkylation of 5- cholestene -3/3- 
thiol.1 2  A more facile, one-step method of prepa­
ration is afforded by the reaction of methaneth- 
iol with cholesteryl p-toluenesulfonate. When the re­
action is carried out in glacial acetic acid the product 
separates from the reaction mixture. Crystalliza­
tion from ether-methanol and then acetone yields 
3(3-methylthio-5-cholestene (III), m.p. 125-126° 
in 80% yield.1 3  From the mother liquors a small 
amount of the isomeric 3a-methylthio-5-eholestene
(V), m.p. 110°, was isolated.
The configurational assignment for III is based 
on an independent synthesis from o-cholestene-3/3- 
thiol and on the reaction of its sulfonium derivative 
with various nucleophilic reagents, particularly 
hydroxide ion. Nucleophilic attack occurred ex­
clusively on an iS'-rnethyl group giving the steroid 
sulfide with displacement of the methyl group. 
This was the case with hydroxide ion (IV)a,

of the axial isomer (V) reacts with hydroxide ion 
to give dimethyl sulfide and 3,5-cholestadiene (VII). 
These results are in agreement with earlier observa­
tions concerning quaternary ammonium hydrox­
ides.1 5 1 6  Hofmann elimination is favored by a 
trans  coplanar arrangement in the transition state 
of the hydrogen atom, dimethylsulfide group and 
two carbon atoms going from sp3  to sp2  bonding. 
In such a transition state, the leaving hydrogen 
atom and the dimethyl sulfide group are axial. 
The equatorial 3/3-sulfonium derivative lacks the 
steric requirements for facile Hofmann elimination, 
hence displacement at the S-methyl group is 
favored.1 7  Attack at C3  to give cholesterol would not 
be anticipated since, in addition to the statistical 
factor of two in favor of S-methyl attack, steric 
factors make sN -2 displacements at cyclohexyl- 
carbon atoms much slower.1 8  A further conse­
quence of the axial conformation in V is its much 
slower reaction with methyl iodide as compared to 
the rate of reaction of the equatorial isomer (III).1 9
When cholesteryl p-toluenesulfonate was treated 
with methanethiol in nitromethane the major prod­
uct again was 3/J-methylthio-5-eholestene. In addi­
tion to the major product a very small amount of a 
compound melting at 90-92° was isolated. W re have 
tentatively assigned the f-cholestane structure,
3,5-cyelo-6/3-mcthylthiocholestane (VIII) to this 
isomer.

This assignment is based on the following data: 
elemental analyses, reaction with methyl iodide to 
form a sulfonium derivative, rearrangement to 
cholesteryl acetate in acetic acid containing a few 
drops of sulfuric acid, and rearrangement to 3 /3- 
methylthio-5-eholestene in the presence of methane­
thiol and p-toluenesulfonic acid.2 0  The /3-conforma- 
tion at C 6 is assigned on the basis of facile Hofmann 
elimination of dimethyl sulfide with alkali. This con­
formation is also in agreement with the orientation 
of 3,5-cyclo-0d-methoxycholestane obtained by

At this point it is of interest to note tht the re­
action of thiophenol with cholesteryl p-toluene- 
sulfonate leads to 3,5-diphenylthiocholestane.2 2  2 3  
On the other hand extended treatment of choles­
teryl p-toluenesulfonate with sodium thiophenoxide 
yields 3,5-cyclo-6-cholestene (8%), 6/3-phenylthio-
3,5-cyclocholestane (32%), and 3a-phenylthio-5- 
cholestene (13%). No detectable amount of 3 /3 - 
phenylthio-5-cholestene is formed. Shoppee and 
co-workers have attributed these results to the 
abnormally great reactivity of the thiophenoxide 
ion in processes involving attack on covalently 
bound hydrogen and to the high nucleophilic power 
of this ion. In contrast, methanethiol and dimethyl 
sulfide, weak nucleophilic reagents, react chiefly 
by a unimolecular heterolysis leading to retention 
of configuration.

Cholesteryl p-toluenesulfonate, 2.71 g. (0.005 mole), was 
suspended in 75 m'.. of nitromethane contained in a pressure 
bottle (Fisher Scientific Co., Catalog No. 3-100), a large 
excess (10-15 ml.) of dimethyl sulfide was added, and the 
stoppered flask placed in an oven at 40°. The fine sterol par­
ticles gradually disappeared and were replaced by flat 
platelike crystals adhering to the wall of the flask. This 
transformation was usually complete at the end of the 
fourth day. The mixture was cooled at 0° and the crystals 
were washed with cold nitromethane, then with ether. The 
mother liquor and washings were evaporated in vacuo.  The 
residue was dissolved in methanol and the small ether- 
insoluble component was added to the main crop of crystals. 
Recrvstallized from methanol-ether, they weighed 2.78 g.

5-cholestene, 2 ml. of methyl p-toluenesulfonate, and 25 
ml. of nitromethane was heated at 40° for 10 days. The mix­
ture was diluted with ether and filtered. The residue was 
crystallized from ethanol. The melting point of the product 
(204°) was undepressed when mixed with the product ob­

droxide, and 1.5 g. (0.0025 mole) of 3S-dimethylsulfonio-5-

cooled mixture was diluted with water and filtered. The 
residue, after crystallization from acetone, melted at 126°. 
No depression was observed in a mixed melting point with 
3/3-methylthio-5-cholestene.
When 3/3-dimethylsulfonio-5-cholestene iodide1 3  was 
treated with aqueous-alcoholic potassium hydroxide the re­
sulting product again was 3/S-methvlthio-5-cholestene. 
On the other hand, treatment of 3«-dimethylsulfonio-5-

from the ether layer, crystallized from acetone, gave a 
product melting at 126°, which showed no depression on

vated Raney nickel was filtered and rapidly washed with 
cold dioxane to remove water. Ten grams of the metal were 
added to an ice-cold solution of 1.0 g. of the sulfur-containing 
sterol in dioxane. The mixture was warmed cautiously, then 
refluxed gently for 7 hr. The residue on the filter was washed 
with ether and the ether dioxane filtrate distilled in vacuo.  
The solution of the residue in ether, treated with methanol, 
yielded a crystalline product. After several recrystalliza­
tions, this melted at 90-91° and showed a specific rotation 
of — 56, values which agree with those given in the litera­
ture for 5-cholestene. The qualitative test for sulfur was 
negative. The sulfur-free products from bcth sulfur deriva­
tives were identical as shown by mixed melting point deter­
minations.
In both instances large losses of product occurred and no 
attempt was made at precise quantitative recovery.

In contrast to other hydrazones previously investigated, benzophenone hydrazone reacts with tetrachloro- and tetra- 
bromo-o-benzoquinone giving benzophenor.e azine in both cases. The nature of the products obtained by the action of p- 
benzoquinone on hydrazones in benzene depends on the molecular ratios of the reactants used. When using equimelecular 
amounts, the p-benzoquinoazines II, III, and IV are obtained from fluorenone, xanthone, and benzophenone hydrazones, 
respectively. Fluorenone ami xanthone azir.es are produced when using two moles of the corresponding hydrazones, while 
with benzophenone hydrazone the condensation product V is obtained. The action of hydrazine hydrate on the quinoazines 
II, III, and IV is investigated and a reaction mechanism is suggested. p-Benzoquinone reacts with hydrazones in alcohol 
giving mainly the corresponding ketazines independent of the molecular ratios of the reactants used. Hydroquinone is ob­
tained almost quantitatively by the action of hydrazine hydrate on p-benzoquinone. The molluscacidal activity of the quinone 
and derivatives is tested.

In trying to apply this reaction to benzophenone 
hydrazone, the corresponding cyclic ether is not 
obtained as would be expected, but instead, benzo­
phenone azine is formed whether using tetrachloro- 
or tetrabromo-o-benzoquinone. The reaction takes 
place readily at room temperature and is greatly 
accelerated by heat, giving an almost quantitative 
yield of the azine. The reaction provides an easy 
and quantitative method for the preparation of 
benzophenone azine, the preparation of which 
has been found rather difficult by some authors.3  
It is thought that the reaction takes place through 
the intermediate formation of bisdiphenylmethylene 
tetrazone which is unstable in the presence of the 
high potential quinone. The formation of tetra- 
zones by the oxidation of hydrazines is well known.4

In an attempt to obtain p-benzoquinoazines of 
the type R2 —C =N —N = R '= 0 , the action of p- 
benzoquinone on hydrazones was investigated. 
AVieland and Roseeu5  found that the quinone 
reacts with fluorenone hydrazone in alcohol giving 
fluorenone azine. In contrast, it has been found that 
when the reaction is carried out in dry benzene,  
the nature of the reaction products depends mainly 
on the molecular ratios of the reactants. Thus, 
when equimolecular amounts are used, the p-

(5) Id. Wicland and A. Roseeu, Ann.,  381, 229 (1911).benzoquinoazines II, III, and IV are obtained by 
the action of p-benzoquinone on fluorenone, xan­
thone, and benzophenone hydrazones, respectively, 
in boiling dry benzene. The azines are highly 
colored, insoluble in alkali, and exhibit the usual 
halochromism when added to concentrated sulfuric 
acid.2  On the other hand, when two moles of fluore­
none or xanthone hydrazones are used in this re­
action, fluorenone and xanthone azines are mainly 
obtained while with benzophenone hydrazone the 
condensation product V is formed. This difference 
in the nature of the products of the reaction with
different hydrazones when two moles are used 
might be explained by assuming that the resonance 
structure (VI) contributes significantly to the actual 
state of the quinoazine molecule. In the case of
II and III, the reactivity of the carbonyl group 
towards condensation with another molecule of 
the hydrazone is decreased and the carbonium ion 
stabilized by the strong resonance with the xan- 
thylene and fluorenylidene residues. The formation 
of the azines is believed to be due mainly to the 
reaction between the p-benzoquinoazine first 
formed and the other molecule of the hydrazone. 
This is supported by the fact that when boiling 
a benzene solution of equimolecular amounts of
III and xanthone hydrazone, the expected xan­
thone azine is obtained in amounts greater than 
would be produced from a simple oxidation of the 
hydrazone used. II reacts similarly with fluorenone 
hydrazone producing fluorenone azine. However, 
in the case of IV and benzophenone hydrazone, 
benzophenone azine together with V are obtained.
When the reaction of p-benzoquinone and hydra­
zones is carried out in alcohol instead of dry ben­
zene, the corresponding ketazines are mainly ob­
tained regardless of the molecular ratios of the re-
1 6 1 6 LA TIF AND FATHY VOL. 2 5
actants used. It is thought that in this medium 
the zwitterion structure YII contributes largely 
to the actual state of the p-benzoquinone molecule.
In order to confirm the structure of the p- 
benzoquinoazines, their reaction with hydrazine 
hydrate was investigated. In contrast to the

action of hydrazones, it has been found that hjr- 
drazine hydrate reacts with these quinoazines in 
alcohol giving phenol, and the corresponding hy­
drazones and azines in all cases. For example, when 
IV is allowed to react with hydrazine hydrate in 
boiling alcohol, phenol and benzophenone hydra- 
zone are mainly obtained according to Scheme C, 
together with a small amount of benzophenone 
azine, and 110 condensation products are obtained. 
This might be due to the relat ively high basicity of 
hydrazine compared with hydrazones and in turn 
its great nucleophilic character. Btaudinger and 
Kupfer6  reported the formation of Irpdrazones from 
azines by the action of hydrazine hydrate under 
pressure and at elevated temperature.
p-Benzoquinone reacts with hydrazine hy­
drate at room temperature giving hydroquinone in 
an almost pure state. This obviates the formation of 
by-products usually met with in the reduction of 
the quinone by phenyl hydrazine7  and in turn 
an almost quantitative yield is obtained.

hydroquinone is less active. II and III could not 
be tested since they are almost insoluble in the 
solvents usually used for the test. Benzophenone 
azine is inactive in concentrations up to 20 p.p.m. 
This remarkable activity of the quinone and its 
azine (IV) might be due to their inhibition effect 
on the oxygen consumption of the snails, von Brand 
et al."  have shown that certain phenanthra- and 
naphthaquinones inhibit the oxygen consumption 
of Aastralorbis glabratus  snails in high dilutions. 
Details of the experiments will be published sepa­
rately.
EXPERIMENTAL
p-Benzoquinone was reerystallized from petroleum ether 
(b.p. 40-60°) and dried. “Analar” benzene which had been 
dried over sodium was used. Benzophenone hydrazone was 
prepared by the general method described by Schonberg 
et al.;1 1  the hydrazone which separated on cooling was 
washed well with petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°) and dried.
Reaction of tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone with benzophenone  
hydrazone.  A solution of benzophenone hydrazone (1 g.) in 
dry ether (25 ml.) was added in portions to a boiling solu­
tion of the quinone (1.3 g.) in dr}' ether (25 ml.). A vigorous 
reaction took place after each addition and the red color 
of the quinone disappeared. The reaction mixture was re­
fluxed for 30 min. and left to cool. The solid was filtered, 
crystallized from alcohol, and shown to be benzophenone 
azine (melting point and mixed melting point). The mother 
liquor was evaporated to dryness and another crop of benzo­
phenone azine was obtained when a few ml. of alcohol was 
added to the residues (total yield 0.82 g., about 90%)- The 
alcoholic solution, after separation of the azine, was poured 
onto ice cold water, and acidified with a few drops of dilute 
hydrochloric acid. The precipitate was filtered, dried, and 
dissolved in acetic anhydride. The mixture was refluxed for 
30 mir. then left to cool. The solution was then poured onto 
ice, left overnight, and the solid crystallized from alcohol as 
colorless crystals which proved to be the diacctate of tetra- 
chloroeatechol (melting point and mixed melting point).
When tetrabromo-o-benzoquinone was used in the above 
experiment, benzophenone azine was similarly obtained.
Reaction of p-benzoquinonc with benzophenone hydrazone.  
(a). Preparation of N ,-p-bcnzoquinonyliilene-Ni-&iphenyl-  
mcthyl -nenzinc  (IV). A  solution of benzophenone hydrazone 
(  0.78 g., 1  mole) and p-benzoquinone (0.43 g., 1  mole)  in dry 
benzene (15 ml.) was refluxed for 3 hr. on the water bath. 
The reaction mixture, which became red-brown, was filtered 
while hot and the benzene was evaporated to dryness under 
reduced pressure. Then a few drops of methyl alcohol was 
added to the oily residue. The solid IV, which separated on 
standi ig, was reerystallized from methyl alcohol as orange 
crysta.s m.p. 109-110° (yield 0.8 g.). It is insoluble in sodium 
hydroxide solution (10(c  )  and gives a brick red color with 
coned, sulfuric acid.

Reaction of  IV with benzophenone hydrazone.  A solution 
of IV (0.71 g.) and benzophenone hydrazone (0.5 g.) in dry 
benzene (15 ml.) was refluxed as above. The reaction mix­
ture was filtered while hot, concentrated, and left to cool. 
The orange crystals which separated were recrystallized 
from benzene and shown to be V (melting point and mixed 
melting point yield 0.2 g., about 25%). The mother liquor 
was then evaporated to dryness and methyl alcohol added 
to the oily residue. The crystals which separated on standing 
were recrystallized from alcohol and shown to be benzo­
phenone azine (melting point and mixed melting point, 
yield about 50%).
Action of hydrazine hydrate on  (IV). A mixture of IV (2 
g.), hydrazine hydrate (about 95%, 4 ml.), and alcohol (25

filtered, crystallized from alcohol, and proved to be benzo­
phenone azine (0.14 g.). The filtrate was concentrated and 
left to cool; benzophenone hydrazone (0.9 g.) was obtained. 
The mother liquor was then poured onto ice and a 10% 
solution of sodium hydroxide was added. The alkaline mix­
ture was extracted with ether and the aqueous layer was 
acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid and extracted with 
ether several times. The ethereal extract was washed with a 
small amount of water and evaporated to dryness. The oily 
residue was extracted with boiling water and the solution 
was left to cool. Bromine water was then added and the crys­
talline solid was filtered, dried, and reerystallized from 
petroleum ether (b.p. 40-60°) as colorless crystals (1.3 g.) 
which were shown to lie tribromophenol (melting point

Dehydrogenation of acenaphthene with tetraehloro-o-henzoqninone has been investigated by Braude, Brook, and Lin- 
stead. The low recoverv of total hydrocarlxms reported might be attributed, among other possible factors, to the formation 
of an adduct by the action of the quinone on the acenaphthidene formed. This side reaction should be considered in the 
dehydrogenating power of tetrahalo-o-benzoquinones.
The action of tetrahalo-o-benzoquinones on fluorene provides a simple and new method for the synthesis of fluorylidene 
cyclic ethers. The cyclic ethers Va and Vi are obtained by the action of tetrachloro- and tetrabromo-o-benzoquinone on 
thioxanthione in a carbon dioxide atmosphere. In the presence of air, thioxanthione is oxidized to thioxanthone under the 
effect of tetrahalo-o-benzoquinones. Va and Vb could also be obtained > y  the action of the corresponding tetrahalo-o-benzo- 
quinone on thioxanthone hydrazone.
Braude, Brook, and Linstead2  studied the de­
hydrogenating power of various high potential 
quinones using tetralin, acenaphthene, and di­
benzyl as donors and found that the most effective 
was 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone fol­
lowed by tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone. The extent of 
dehydrogenation was determined by isolating the 
mixture of unchanged and dehydrogenated hydro­
carbons chromatographically from the light petro­
leum extracts o: the reaction mixture, then estimat­
ing the percentage composition speetrometrically. 
When using tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone as the 
dehydrogenating agent and acenaphthene as donor, 
the total hydrocarbon recovered was only 45% 
with 60% dehydrogenation, whereas with tetralin, 
the recovery was 80% with 100% dehydrogenation. 
This remarkable low recovery reported in the case 
of acenaphthene might be attributed, among other 
possible factors, to the possible reaction between 
acenaphthylene formed and the chloroquinone. 
Horner and Merz3  showed that an adduct of the 
formula CisHsChCL is formed in good yield by re­
fluxing a benzene solution of tetrachloro-o-benzo­
quinone and acenaphthylene for one to t wo hours. 
Schonberg and La t if4  have shown that tetrabromo-
o-benzoquinone reacts similarly giving the adduct 
I. These adducts are almost insoluble in light pe­
troleum. Thus the adduct Cw ]IsO -> C  4 , presumably 
formed during the dehydrogenation of acenaphthene 
by tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone, should be precipi­
tated during the light petroleum treatment as 
described by Braude, Brook, and Linstead. In the 
present investigation it has been possible to 
separate this adduct in the form of its quinoxaline 
derivative during the dehydrogenation of acenaph­
thene with tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone. Under these 
conditions this side reaction should be taken into

Although quinones have been extensively used 
for the dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons, 
the role of such quinones, as far as we are aware, 
involved only the removal of hydrogen without 
being incorporated into the molecules of the prod­
ucts formed. The authors have found, however, 
that tetrachloro- and tetrabromo-o-benzoquinone 
react with fluorene in boiling benzene giving the 
cyclic ethers Ha and lib respectively. This re­
action, which has not been described before, pro­
vides a simple and a new method for the synthesis 
of halogenated cyclic ethers derived from fluorene. 
Ila and lib have been previously produced by the 
action of 9-diazofluorene on the corresponding 
quinones.4

The great reactivity of tetrahalo-o-benzoquinones 
has been previously utilized in the direct synthesis 
of halogenated cyclic ethers from certain thiones.5  
Thus, it has been found that tetrachloro- and tetra­
bromo-o-benzoquinone react readily with xanthione 
giving the cyclic ethers Ilia and Illb  respectively. 
The benzopyran derivative IV has been similarly 
obtained by the action of tetrachloro-o-benzoqui-

none on coumarin-2-thione. In trying to apply this 
reaction to other heterocyclic thiones, the action 
of tetrahalo-o-benzoquinones on thioxanthione is 
investigated. In contrast to xanthione, thioxan­
thione reacts in two different ways depending on 
the atmosphere in which the reaction is carried out. 
In a carbon dioxide atmosphere, tetrachloro-, 
and tetrabromo-o-benzoquinone react with the thione 
in boiling dry benzene giving the cyclic ethers Va 
and Vb respectively in good yield. If the reaction 
is carried out while passing dry air instead of carbon 
dioxide, the thione is almost completely oxidized 
to thioxanthone and only slight amounts of the 
corresponding cyclic ethers are formed. The consti­
tution of Ya and Vb is based on analogy5  as well 
as on the fact. that they are colorless, easily hy­
drolyzed with dilute mineral acids giving thixan- 
thone and the corresponding tetrahalocatechol. 
Va could also be obtained by the reaction between 
tetrachlorocatechol and 9,9-dichlorothioxanthene. 
The readiness with which Va and Vb are hydrolyzed 
with dilute hydrochloric acid can be explained on 
similar lines previously suggested for Ilia and Illb.5  
Va and Vb are also obtained easily by the action of 
tetrachloro- and tetrabromo-o-benzoquinone on 
thioxanthone hydrazone. The formation of methyl- 
enedioxy derivatives by the action of tetrahalo-o- 
benzoquinones on ketohydrazones has been previ­
ously described.6  The reaction proceeds through 
the intermediate formation of the corresponding 
diazo-derivative as follows:

The great ease with which thioxanthione is oxi­
dized to thioxanthone by the action of tetrahalo-o- 
benzoquinones in air even in the absence of sun­
light is rather remarkable. Thioxanthione is resist­
ant to oxidation by oxygen except in presence of 
light.7

“Analar” benzene which had been dried over sodium was 
used in the reactions. The thioxanthione used was reerys- 
tallized to a sharp melting point 108°.
Reaction of tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone with acenaphthene.  
A solution of tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone (2.58 g.) and 
acenaphthene (1.54 g.) in benzene (15 ml.) was refluxed on 
the water bath for 10 hr. The reaction mixture was then 
filtered while hot, concentrated, and left to cool. On stand­
ing for about 24 hr. a solid separated from the viscid solu­
tion. This was filtered, washed first with a mixture of ben­
zene and light petroleum (b.p. 40-60°), then with cold ben­
zene and dissolved in the least amount of boiling glacial 
acetic acid. To the solution, a saturated solution of o-phenyl- 
enediamine in methyl alcohol was added, and the mixture 
boiled for about 5 min. The crystalline solid which separated 
was filtered and crystallized from benzene. It proved to be 
the quinoxaline of the adduct previously obtained by Horner 
and Merz5  by the action of the quinone on acenaphthylene.
Action of tetraehloro-o-benzoquinone on fluorene.  A solution 
of tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone (2.4 g.) and fluorene (1.8 g.) 
in benzene (30 ml.) was refluxed for 5 hr. on the water bath. 
The red color of the quinone disappeared and the reaction 
mixture became brown. This was filtered while hot and the 
benzene evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. To 
the residue a few ml. of ether was added and the solid which 
separated was filtered and crystallized from acetone to give
9,9-(tetrachloro-o-phenylenedioxy)fluorene, Ila, as color­
less crystals, m.p. 285° (undepressed when admixed with an 
authentic sample prepared by the action of 9-diazofluorene

Action of tetrabromo-o-benzoquinone on fluorene.  A solution 
of the quinone (4.2 g.) and fluorene (1.8 g.) in benzene (30

of thioxanthione (2 g.) in benzene (20 ml.) while passing 
dry carbon dioxide, and boiling was continued for 3 hr. The 
reaction mixture which became brown was filtered while 
hot and the solution was evaporated to dryness under re­
duced pressure. To the residue, acetone was added and the 
solid which separated was recrystallized from benzene to 
give Va as colorless crystals, m.p. 221°; yield about 70%.

Va (0.2 g.) and the mixture boiled for 30 min., and left to 
cool. It was then poured onto ice and the yellowish precipi­
tate formed was filtered, dried, and dissolved in the least 
amount of boiling methyl alcohol and left to cool. The solid 
which separated was recrystallized from alcohol and proved 
to be thioxanthone (by melting point and mixed melting 
point). The mother liquor was poured onto cold water 
which has been acidified with hydrochloric acid. The pre­
cipitate which formed was filtered, dried, dissolved in acetic 
anhydride, and the solution was refluxed for 30 min. It 
was then left to cool and poured onto ice. The solid which 
separated was crystallized from methyl alcohol and proved 
to be the diacetate of tetrachlorocatechol.

O-Aryl phosphorodichloridothioates on reaction with ammonia and aliphatic amines gave O-aryl phosphoramidochlorido- 
thioates and O-aryl phosphorodiamidothioates in high yields. O-Aryl phosphorodichloridothioates also react with substituted 
hydrazines to give O-aryl phosphorohydrazidochloridothioates and O-aryl phosphorodihydrazidothioates in high yields. The 
reactions were found to be dependent on temperature of reaction, mole ratio, and mode of addition of the reagents. Aromatic 
amines produced amido acid chlorides only, whereas hydrazine gave dihydrazides. O-Aryl phosphoramidohydrazidothioates 
were prepared by amidation of hydrazido acid chlorides and by hydrazidation of amido acid chlorides. A possible explanation 
of the difference observed in the reactions of the organophosphorus acid halides is presented.
The recent development of improved and con­
venient processes for the preparation of O-aryl 
phosphorodichloridothioates2  prompted a study 
of the reactions of these phosphorus acid chlorides 
with compounds containing labile hydrogen atoms. 
The investigations described in this publication 
are concerned with the reactions of O-aryl phos­
phorodichloridothioates with ammonia, aliphatic 
and aromatic amines, hydrazine, and substituted 
hydrazines.

chlorine atom in II would then be less reactive 
toward further nucleophilic attack because of a 
decrease in the partial positive charge on the 
phosphorus atoms. This change in the electron 
density would result because of the displacement 
of the electronegative chlorine atom by the less 
electronegative amido group. As no successful 
preparation or isolation of an amido acid chloride
(II) or a hydrazido acid chloride [—P(S)(NH—
IX—)C1] had been reported in the literature, our 
main efforts were directed toward the preparation 
of such intermediates which would enable us to 
develop a scheme of reactions as outlined in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. Reaction scheme
Anhydrous ammonia and aliphatic amines under­
went both reactions (a) and (g), Fig. 1. These re­
actions were determined by temperature, mole 
ratio and mode of addition of the reactants. The 
slow addition of two moles of an aliphatic amine to 
one mole of a well stirred solution of O-aryl phos- 
phorodichloridothioate in ether or benzene at 0° 
to 10° gave the O-aryl phosphoramidochloridothio- 
ate and the amine hydrochloride, generally in high 
yields. Anhydrous ammonia added to 0-(2,4,5- 
trichlorophenyl) phosphorodichloridothioate pro­
duced an amido acid chloride in satisfactory yield 
only at — 20 to — 30°. Attempts to prepare this 
particular amido acid chloride at higher tempera­
tures were unsuccessful. The reverse addition, 
using the same amount of reactants as indicated 
above, always gave a mixture of diamide and un­
reacted acid chloride.
The amido acid chlorides were isolated by filter­
ing from amine hydrochloride and removing sol­
vent under reduced pressure. Amido acid chlorides 
could also be freed from amine hydrochlorides by 
a water wash. In many instances liquid products 
crystallized when stirred with cold low-boilingpetroleum ether. The products which did not 
crystallize were purified by petroleum ether 
extraction, the amido acid chlorides being soluble 
whereas diamidos were generally insoluble. The 
solid products were recrystallized from petroleum 
ether. Most of the amido acid chlorides prepared 
from aliphatic amines were white crystalline solids 
possessing well defined melting points. Although 
these acid chlorides did not decompose at their 
melting points, the amido acid chlorides prepared 
from primary amines might be expected to de- 
hydrochlorinate at higher temperatures. No de­
composition was ever encountered on storage at 
room temperature, however.
These phosphorus acid halides were relatively 
stable to hydrolysis. In many instances the crude 
amido acid chlorides were washed with water to 
free them from amine hydrochloride with no ap­
parent decomposition. Aqueous isopropylamine was 
successfully employed in the preparation of 0- 
(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) isopropylphosphoramido- 
chloridothioate (yield 80%). Evidently these phos­
phorus acid halides are considerably more resistant 
toward hydrolysis than phenylphosphonothioic 
dichloride, for Smith and Audrieth9  have found the 
latter hydrolyzes so rapidly that aqueous amines 
are unsuitable for amidation.
The most interesting compound of this series 
was that prepared from anhydrous ammonia, for 
it represents the first reported phosphorus acid 
chloride containing the grouping [ —P(S)(XH2 )C1]. 
As might be expected, this amido acid chloride 
was not as stable as those prepared from aliphatic 
amines. While no decomposition was observed on 
taking the melting point, the compound did dete­
riorate in about two months on storage at room tem­
perature.
Table I lists the physical and analytical data for 
an umber of O-aryl phosphoramidochloridothioates.
Symmetrical diamides were prepared by the re­
action of O-aryl phosphorodichloridothioates with 
at least four equivalents of aqueous or anhydrous 
ammonia and aliphatic amines [route(g) ]. A useful 
method for the preparation of unsymmetrical di­
amides was that of route (b). A definite decrease 
in the rate of formation of diamides was observed 
in going from ammonia and primary amines to the 
branched and bulkier amines. The unsymmetrical 
diamides described in this report were prepared 
from purified amido acid chlorides. All diamides 
reported herein were white crystalline solids with 
well defined melting points.
Further chemical evidence for the existence of 
the amido acid chlorides was established by the 
preparation of an unsymmetrical diamide from 
two different amido acid chlorides (Fig. 2). Prepa­
rations of the unsymmetrical diamide 0-(2,4,5-

Amidation of O-aryl phosphorodichlorodothioates 
with aniline and m-chloroaniline in the absence of a 
separate hydrogen chloride acceptor reacted dif­
ferently and unexpectedly, proceeding only to the 
extent of reaction (a), Fig. 1. This reaction required 
several hours of refluxing. Furthermore, it was not 
clear-cut and side reactions resulted—a marked 
contrast to the other amine reactions discussed.

identity of the product. We prepared this com­
pound, which was a dark brown oil. The infrared

In order to allow the aromatic amines to react 
through route (g) to the dianilide, it was necessary 
to carry out a Schotten-Baumann reaction as sug­
gested by Autenrieth and Hildebrand.5In view of the results obtained from amidation 
studies, hydrazides offered an interesting chal­
lenge. Previous workers restricted themselves to 
the preparation of symmetrical dihydrazides and 
apparently made no attempt to isolate or identify 
intermediates such as a hydrazido acid chloride.4-6 
We approached the problem in a manner similar to 
that described for the amides, i . e . along routes (c),
(d), and (h),Fig. 1.

in ether at 0° to 10° produced the hydrazido acid 
chlorides (route c) in nearly quantitative yields, 
again demonstrating a degree of difference in the 
ease of displacement of the phosphoryl halogen of

-OP(S)Cl, and —OP(S)(N—N—)C1 by the nu­
cleophilic reagent. Crystalline hydrazido acid 
chlorides were recrystallized from petroleum ethers 
and liquid products purified by extraction with 
petroleum ether. These acid chlorides were as stable 
as the amido acid chlorides toward hydrolysis and 
on storage. No decomposition was observed on 
melting.
Phenylhydrazine differed from 1,1-dimethyl- 
hydrazine only in that lower temperatures, — 20 
to — 30°, were required to prepare the hydrazido 
acid chloride. As no solvent suitable for crystalli­
zation could be found, this hydrazido acid chloride 
was purified by dissolving in ether, precipitating 
insoluble material by the addition of petroleum 
ether (b.p. 30-60°), and removing the solvents 
under reduced pressure. This acid chloride was 
considerably less stable than the previously de­
scribed acid chlorides. On standing at room temper­
ature for a few weeks the sample deteriorated with 
sublimation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol.
Attempts to prepare hydrazido acid chlorides 
from anhydrous hydrazine were unsuccessful. 
Failure to find nonreactive solvents compatible 
with anhydrous hydrazine and O-aryl phosphoro- 
dichloridothioates was a contributing factor. 
We were interested in the synthesis of amidohy- 
drazides as additional proof for the existence of the 
disclosed amido and hydrazido acid chlorides. 
The reaction of 0-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) 2,2-di- 
methylphosphorohydrazidochloridothioate with 
methylamine [route (f) ]  gave the same amido- 
hydrazide (Fig. 3) as that obtained by hydrazida- 
tion of 0-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) methylphosphor- 
amidochloridothioate with 1,1-dimethylhydrazine 
[route (e)]. Physical properties and analyticaldata for O-aryl phosphorohydrazidochloridothioates 
are given in Table III.
Table IV lists the properties of O-aryl phosphor- 
amidohydrazidothioates. The amidohydrazides were 
crystalline solids, recrystallizable from lower al­
cohols. All but one had melting points below those 
of the corresponding diamides and dihydrazides.

The formation of the many products resulting 
from amidation and hydrazidation of O-aryl 
phosphorodichloridates can be related to electronic 
effects, steric effects, and base strength of the 
nucleophilic reagents as well as to reaction tem­
peratures, mole ratios, and mode of addition of 
reagents.

v ia two bimolecular reactions—(a) and (b). The 
phosphorus atom of the dichlorothioate is more 
susceptible to nucleophilic attack than the phos­
phorus atom of the amido acid chloride. When 
ammonia or an amine was added to a dichlorido- 
thioate, an amido acid chloride was generally ob­
tained in high yields with little or no diamide. The 
amido nitrogen, following displacement of one of the 
two chlorine atoms attached to the phosphorus 
atom, decreases the positive charge on phosphorus 
v ia an inductive effect. This increase in electron 
density about the phosphorus atom causes the re­
maining chlorine atom to be less susceptible to 
further nucleophilic attack.
All of the nitrogen bases studied (except hydra­
zine) with plva values substantially higher than 5 
gave a constant pattern of reaction; products v ia 
routes (a), (b), (g), (c), (d), and (h) in Fig. I were 
obtained in high yields.
Dostrovsky and Holmann,1 1  in their kinetics 
studies on the amidation of dialkyl phosphoro- 
chloridates, showed that secondary amines, though 
stronger nucleophiles, reacted much more slowly 
than corresponding primary amines, indicating
(11) I. Drostovsky and M. Holmann, J .  C h e m . S o c.  
511 (1953).the operation of steric factors. These steric effects 
are also operative in the rate of formation of di­
amide vs. amidochloride. When ammonia gas was 
used to prepare the amidochloride, it was necesary 
to go to temperatures of — 20° to — 30° to obtain 
an amidochloride free of diamide, whereas iso­
propylamine gave the diamide only at temperatures 
above 30°.
Hydrazine gave the expected dihydrazide but 
failed to give a hydrazidochloride of sufficient 
purity and yield for identification, even at tempera- 
tues of — 30° and — 40°. Being a bifunctional ma­
terial, hydrazine may behave anomalously on 
partial hydrazidation. The substituted hydrazines, 
having less bifunctional character and offering 
more steric interaction, did give the expected 
hydrazidochloride. Tolkmith and Britton1 2  have 
found that the bifunctionality of amines such as 
ethylenediamine makes the isolation of an inter­
mediate amido acid chloride improbable, for only 
the heterocyclic product resulting from complete 
dehydrochlorination was obtained.
Of the group of weak organic bases, aniline, m - 
chloroaniline, and phenylhydrazine reacted quite 
differently and unexpectedly. Independent of mole 
ratio of reactants and reaction conditions, the 
anilines did not react beyond the formation of 
aryl-OP(S)(Cl)NHC6 H6 , while phenylhydrazine 
readily produced aryl-OP(S)(NH—NH—(AHsK 
and it was necessary to perform the reaction at 
—  30° to obtain the product aryl-OP(S)(Cl)- 
NH—NH—C rH o- The lack of reactivity of aniline 
to form the diamido product was probably due more 
to its low basicity, pKa = 4.58, than to steric *  7 0 5

The ease of reaction of phenylhydrazine, as 
evidenced by ready formation of aryl-OPS(Cl)- 
(NHNHC6 H6 ) as well as of aryl-OPS (N IiXH CrJIs) 2 , 
may be related to the fact that phenylhydrazine 
has a somewhat higher pKa value (5.2) and a much 
more favorable steric factor than aniline.

The liquid organic amines employed were freshly redistilled

a chilled flask, then used. All hydrazines were used as com­
mercial materials, except phenylhydrazine which was re­
distilled. The synthetic procedures for the preparation of the 
various amides and hydrazides are illustrated by the follow­

Fluorine-containing organosilanes have been prepared by the interaction of vinylsilanes with fluoroolefins. Cyclic adducts 
of the type CX 2—CF 2—CH 2—CH—(CH;),,—SiR 3 (where X equals fluorine and/or chlorine, n equals 0 to 3, and R equals 
i________________ i
ethoxy, methyl, and/or chlorine) are obtained when trifluoroiodoethylene was used with the vinylsilanes.
The thermal and chemical stability of the silicon 
polymers and tetraalkylsilanes 1'2 and the well 
known inherent stability of the polyfluorocarbons 
have led to attempts to incorporate the attributes 
of both systems into fluoroalkyl silicon compounds 
of high stability.
A number of new fluorine-containing cyclobutyl- 
silanes have been prepared from fluoroolefins and 
alkenysilanes under conditions which generally 
favor cyclic codimer reactions rather than linear 
telomerization. All reactions were carried out in 
Pyrex combustion tubes at about 200° with hydro- 
quinone and/or Terpene-B as free-radical inhibitors. 
The rationale for this study was based on the reason­
ing that the /3-fluorine atoms of the cyclobutyl 
moiety in compounds of the type CX2 —CF2 —i___________
CH2 —CH—SiR 3 (where X is fluorine and/oring cyclobutylsilane was unaffected by dilute 
hydrochloric acid. Similarly, a 20% solution of 
potassium hydroxide at 70° for ten hours had no 
effect on the compound. On the other hand, a- 
fluorme-containing silanes while thermally stable 
undergo immediate hydrolysis in cold dilute alkali .3
The free radical additions of fluoroalkyl halides 
to vinylsilanes were also studied. Perfluorovinyl 
iodide added photochemically to vinyltrimethyl- 
silane to give CF 2= C F —CH 2—CHI—SiCl 3 and 
CF2= C F —CH 2—CHI—Si (CH3 ) 3 in 56% and 16% 
yields, respectively. These yields are in line with 
the observation of Tarrant 4 that difluorodibromo- 
methane added more readily to vinyltrichlorosilane 
than to vinyltrimethylsilane.
The structure of III was established chemically 
by the reduction of the chlorine atom by lithium 
aluminum hydride followed by the unequivocal 
synthesis of IV according to the following scheme:

chlorine) would be close enough to the silicon atoms 
to improve or enhance the thermal stability of the 
silicon-carbon bond. From sterie considerations 
and the well known stability of fluorine-containing 
cyclobutanes toward alkaline hydrolysis, it was 
assumed that the fluorine-containing cyclobutyl 
group would be hydrolytically stable.
Thus, tetrafluoroethylene was codimerized with 
vinyltrimethylsilane in 82% yields to give CF2 —
CF 2—CH 2—CH—Si(CHs) 3. This fluorine-contain-_____________ i

at 90-100° to the trimethylsilylcyclobutane (II) 
definitely proved the vicinal character of the 
chlorine atoms. The cis-trans  relationship of the 
chlorine atoms in I is unknown.
The hydrogenation of II to IV with palladium- 
on-charcoal as a catalyst proceeded quantitatively 
at room temperature. The chlorine atom in III was 
reduced in 64% yield by lithium aluminum hydride 
to give IV. The infrared spectra of IV obtained by 
both methods were found to be identical.

On the basis of the known structures of III and
I, it is reasonable to assume that all fluoroolefins
of the type, CF2  =  CX2  (where X is fluorine and/or 
chlorine) codimerize with vinylsilanes to give prod­
ucts of similar structure ( e.g., CX2 —CF2 —CH»— 
CH—SiR3 ). 1 -------------------- —

This mode of addition seems quite reasonable and 
the reaction is diagnostic of the conjugative nature 
of a vinyl group joined to silicon,6 '6  but apparently 
of small importance in the cyclization reactions 
described here, as all the alkenylsilanes gave 
essentially the same kind of products.
The structure of the resultant cyclobutanes was 
consistent with other proved structures of various 
codimers of l,l-difluoro-2,2-dihaloethylene and a 
conjugated, terminally unsaturated system. How­
ever, the activating influence of the silicon atom was

The influence of the trimethylsilyl group and the 
trichlorosilyl group on the double bond of the vinyl 
group was demonstrated to be in the same direction. 
Thus, when the trichlorosilylcyclobutane obtained 
from the codimerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene 
and vinyltrichlorosilane was treated with methyl 
magnesium bromide, a trimethylsilylcyclobutane 
was obtained which was identical to the one pre­
pared from the codimerization of chlorotrifluoro­
ethylene and vinyltrimethylsilane. This was also 
demonstrated in the codimerization reaction of 
chlorotrifluoroethylene and a-chlorovinyltrichloro- 
silane and a-chloro vinyltrimethylsilane.
The relative conjugative ability of the trimethyl­
silyl and the trichlorosilyl groups is less defined; 
however, it is theorized that the trichlorosilyl 
group might be more effective in increasing the 
reactivity of the double bond in the vinyl groups, 
as the chlorine atoms on the silicon atom would
better stabilize the contributing form, Cl3 S i=  +
CII—CHR because of their electronegativity. 
This effect may be slight, however. Under the re­
action conditions employed it was not surprising 
to observe no definite trends in the yields of 
products, when vinyltrichlorosilane or vinyltri­
methylsilane was codimerized with 1,1-difluoro-
2,3-dihaloethylenes.

prepared by the method of LaZerte 8 by the pyrolysis of 
sodium perfluorobutyrate. The y-ield in this reaction was 
not determined, as only a small amount of tetrafluoro­

that cyclobutane and monosubstituted cyclobutanes ab­
sorb in the 10.85-11.10 p region. These bands have tenta­
tively been assigned to CH; rocking frequencies. If this 
assignment to the CH? modes of vibration is correct, ab­
sorption in this region would not lie expected in fully sub­
stituted materials. Reid and Sack 2 1  2 2 confirmed this by the 
observation that fully substituted cyclobutanes absorb in 
the 11.25-11.65 p region and not in the 10.85-11.10 p range. 
Marrison 2 3  2 4  2 5  2 6  2 7  2 8  2 9  3 0 further pointed out that octafluorocyclobutane 
does not absorb in the 10.85-11.10 p region.
In this work, the infrared spectra of fluorine-containing 
cyclobutylsilanes of the type, CX«—CF;—CH?—CH—
(CH;)„-SiR 3 (where It equals chlorine and/or methyl, n 
equals 0 to 3 and X equals fluorine and/or chlorine) 
have been studied. On the basis of the above discus­
sion, these compounds would be expected to absorb in the 
10.85-11.10 p region, as one CH; group remains unsub­
stituted. In the twelve spectra studied this was found to 
be the case, however, in a somewhat wider region. Gener­
ally, a narrow range of absorption was observed for a par­
ticular cyclobutyl group as illustrated in the Table I.

of a number of CH;-cont,aining fluorocyclobutanes have 
been found to absorb in the 10.94-11.06 p region. In con­
trast, perhalocyclobutanes (without a CH; group) have no 
absorption bands in this region .2 5

they are based on the study of a limited number of com­

some dispute over the proper assignment (whether deforma­
tion or rocking) of the absorption bands at 11.75 and 8.0 p, 
both arising from the vibrations of the methyl group bonded 
to silicon .26-28  Recent evidence 26,28 -30  indicates that the 
band in the 11.75 p region is due to silicon-methyl unsym- 
metrical rocking and the band in the 8.0 p region is at­
tributable to symmetrical deformation vibrations of the 
methyl group attached to the silicon atoms. Both these 
bands were observed in the spectra of these fluorocyclo- 
butyltrimethylsilanes. These bands were noticeably absent 
in the spectra of all monosubstituted txichlorosilanes 
studied.

bending modes of the CH; group in the cyclobutane ring. The 
shift to the longer wave length in the spectra of the latter is 
apparently due to the substitution of a hydrogen atom by a 
chlorine atom in the position adjacent to the CH; group in 
the ring .2 3 The position of this band remains relatively 
constant (6.95-7.17 p ) throughout the remainder of the 
series. It is masked to a degree by the asymmetrical de­
formation of the methyl group on the silicon atom and by 
the CH; deformations in the ethyl group in C;H 5—O—Si.
An absorption band in the 3.40 p region is assigned the 
carbon-hydrogen stretching modes in the cyclobutyl group 
and in the methyl groups bonded to silicon, primarily the 
latter. Thus, this band appreciably decreases in the spectra 
of the fluorocyclobutyltrichlorosilanes with a shift to shorter 
wave lengths (3.1-3.3 p ).

In the spectra of CC1;—CF;—CH;—CH—Si( OC;H5 )3 , there
is a broad double band with peaks at 9.05 and 9.23 p. One 
or bota of these bands are attributed to the Si—O—C 
stretching vibration.
An assignment for the silicon-chlorine absorption was not 
attempted since it apparently occurs in a region beyond 15 p.

A series of p-phenylenedisilanes with two or four silicon-attached alkoxy groups has liecn prepared. When these compounds 
were prepared through the intermediate bifunctional Grignard reagents, the over-all yield was determined by the choice of 
solvent, the presence of various reactants which can act as cosolvents, and the reactivity of the condensing silane. Methods 
for preparing the following p-phenylenedisilanes are discussed: p-Phenylenebis (diethoxymethylsilane), p-phenylenebis- 
(ethoxydimethylsilane), p-phenylcnebis(ethoxymethylviriylsilanc), p-phcnylenebis(diethoxyvinylsilane), p-phenylenebis(p- 
chlorophenyldierhoxysilane), p-phen)lenebis(p-anisyldiethoxysilane), p-phenylenebis(diethoxvphenylsilane), p-phenylenebis- 
[diethoxy-p-(Ar,A T -dimethylaminophenyl)silane], and l-diethoxymethylsilyl-4-diethoxyphenylsilylbenzene.
Although a variety of totally alkylated or 
arylated derivatives of p-phenvlenedisilane are 
described in the literature,2-8 little is reported on 
the synthesis of p-phenylenedisilanes that can be 
hydrolyzed in aqueous media to yield hybrid 
arylenesiloxane polymers.
Condensation of trisubstituted silanes with ben­
zene in the presence of aluminum trichloride or 
boron trichloride gave isomeric mixtures of the 
met a and para derivatives, particularly when the 
silane was present in large excess. The isolation 
of pure p-phenylenebis(trichlorosilane), p-phenyl- 
enebis(dichloromethylsilane,) and m-phenylenebis- 
(trichlorosilane) from the crude reaction products 
has been described.9-11
p-Phenylenebis(chlorodimethylsilaue) and p- 
phenylenebis(chlorodiphenylsilane) were obtained 
by Sveda from the Grignard reagent of p-dibromo- 
benzene in ether and the corresponding chloro- 
silanes, but no yields were reported.1 2 '1 3  From 
triethoxymethylsilane and the same Grignard re­
agent, Gainer obtained 9% of p-phenylenebis- 
(ethoxydimethylsilane) and 42% of p-bromophenyl- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  1 0  1 1  1 2  1 3

Grignard reagent of p-bromophenvldimethyleth- 
oxy,silane with triethoxymethylsilane to obtain 39% 
of 1  -diethoxymethylsilyl-4-dimethylethoxysilyl- 
benzene. Lewis prepared p-phenylenebis(ethoxy- 
dimethylsilane) from the Grignard reagent of p- 
dibromobenzene in ether and diethoxydimethyl- 
silane. Although he did not report the yield of the 
pure material, repetition of the procedure in this 
laboratory gave a 31% yield of the phenvlene- 
disilane. The synthesis of l-trichlorosilyl-4-tri- 
ethylsilylbenzene from p-triethylsilylphenylmag- 
liesium bromide has also been reported.2
A series of p-phenylenedisilanes, each with two 
or four silicon-attached ethoxy groups, has been 
prepared (see Table I) in our laboratory. Because 
their preparation required the condensation of a 
bifunctional metallo-organic intermediate with 
a polyfunctional silane, reaction conditions were 
selected to avoid the formation of polymeric 
materials.
Grignard Syntheses.  Yields of 30-40% of p- 
phenylene (diethoxymethylsilane) were obtained 
when the Grignard reagent of p-dibromobenzene 
was prepared in tetrahydrofuran, when this Gri­
gnard reagent was coupled with chlorodiethoxy- 
methylsilane, and when the silane and bromide were 
added concomitantly to the magnesium.
The over-all yield of the various phenylenedi- 
silanes from p-bromobenzene, as well as the identity 
of the by-products, was not limited by the ability 
of the dihalide to form the intermediate Grignard 
reagent, particularly when the dihalide and the 
silane are added concomitantly to the magnesium. 
The yield depended on factors that include the 
identity of the solvent, the presence of the various 
reactants that can act as cosolvents, and the re­
activity of the condensing silane.
In ether the maximum yield of the Grignard 
reagent of p-dibromobenzene that may be ex­
pected is about 12%, unless entrainment procedures 
are used.1 4 -1 9  Also in ether, up to 70% of the mono- *  1 5  1 6

Grignard reagent is usually obtained. The reaction 
of p-dibromobenzene and magnesium in the pres­
ence of ethyl ether and diethoxydimethylsilanes 
gave, unexpectedly, about 30% of the p-phenyl- 
enebis(ethoxyd:methylsilane), which was greater 
than the yield of the bifunctional Grignard reagent 
that is normally obtained in the absence of the. 
silane. Substitution of the triethoxvmethylsilanc 
for diethoxydimethylsilane in the latter procedure 
gave the disilane in about the same proportion 
that would be predicted from the yield of the 
Grignard reagent formed in the absence of the 
silane. The cosolvent effect was apparently lost.
Although the conversion to the bifunctional 
Grignard reagent was higher in tetrahydrofuran,2 0  
the Grignard-tetrahydrofuran complex is less 
reactive toward alkoxysilanes than the Grignard- 
ethvl ether complex. When an attempt was made 
to react the bifunctional Grignard-tetrahydrofuran 
complex and triethoxymethylsilane, the complex 
was sufficiently stable that, no condensation oc­
curred. In tetrahydrofuran, it was necessary that 
the more reactive chlorodiethoxymethylsilane be 
substituted for the triethoxvmethyl silane. With 
this change in the procedure, yields of 30-40% 
were obtained consistently in the preparation of 
p-phenylenebis(diethoxymethylsilane).
The presence of the chlorodiethoxymethylsilane 
did not materially affect the formation of the Gri­
gnard reagent. Similar yields were obtained when the 
silane was added concomitantly to the magnesium 1 7  1 8  1 9

Grignard reagent was precipitated as the Gri­
gnard-tetrahydrofuran complex by external cooling, 
treated with the silane, and heated to effect con­
densation. In the latter procedure the reactivities 
of the various condensing groups permitted a mode 
of addition that would ordinarily be expected to 
yield only highly polymeric materials. This disilane 
was sufficiently stable against hydrolysis that the 
product could be worked up by pouring the re­
action mixture over water.
The reactivity of the alkoxysilanes or the alkoxy- 
ehlorosilanes was also increased by introducing 
groups into the condensing silane that could con­
tribute a net increase in the electron density on 
silicon Although triethoxymethylsilane and the 
phenylcne-Grignard reagent failed to condense, 
diethoxymothylvinvlsilane, whose structure is anal­
ogous to an ally! ether, gave a 9% yield of p- 
phenylenehisfet hoxymet hyl vinylsilane) and tri- 
ethoxyvinylsilane gave 15% of the correspond­
ing product.
Similarly, in the p-phenylenebis(diethoxyphenyl- 
silane) series, substitution of a strong negative 
group para to silicon increased the yields, pre- 
sumab y through an increased reactivity of the 
silicon-attached chlorine. Yields of about 30% were 
obtained when chlorodicthoxyphenylsilane and 
chloro(p-c,hlorophenyl)diet hoxvsilane were con­

benzene in tetrahydrofuran. p-Anisylchlorodieth- 
oxysilanc gave 44% p-phenylenebis(p-anisyldi- 
ethoxysilane), and p-(triethoxysilyl)-A7 ’ ,A-dimethyl- 
amiline2 1  gave 44% p-phenvlenebis [diethoxy-p- 
(.Y,.Y-dimethylaminophenyl)silane]. The latter 
compounds are analogous to p-methoxy- and p- 
dimethylamiuobenzyl derivatives in the carbon 
series.

Aside from the improved yield, the Grignard- 
tetrahydrofuran procedure offers another advan­
tage for the preparation of p-phenylenebis(diethoxy- 
methylsilane).  In ether, considerable unchanged 
p-dibromobenzene was recovered, as well as the 
p-bromophenyldiethoxymethylsilane. Avoiding the 
recovery of the solid and obtaining essentially a 
single volatile reaction product permitted the use 
of simpler distillation procedures. The chief prod­
ucts other than the p-phenylenedisilane were non- 
distillable polymeric products.
Sodium. Condensations.  Consistent with the re­
sults published by Clark, et aZ.,2 1  2 2  p-dibromoben- 
zene failed to condense with chlorodiethoxymethyl- 
silane in the presence of sodium, either with toluene 
or diethyl ether as the reaction medium. When 
one bromine atom was replaced with the diethoxy- 
methylsilyl group, however, p-phenvlenebis(ethoxy- 
dimethylsilane) was obtained in a 27% yield. 
This yield is not significantly different from that 
reported for the condensation of p-bromophenyl- 
trimethylsilane with chlorotrimethylsilane under 
similar conditions (30%).2 2  The presence of silicon- 
attached alkoxy groups does not interfere with the 
normal course of the reaction, demonstrating the 
preferential reactivity of the arylsodium toward 
chlorine.2 3
The unsymmetrical compound, 1-diethoxy- 
methylsilyl-3-diethoxyphenylsilylbenzene, was ob­
tained in only a 6% yield when p-bromophenyl- 
diethoxymethylsilane and chlorodiethoxyphenyl- 
silane were condensed in the presence of sodium 
in refluxing toluene. Interaction with the solvent, 
always an important consideration in arvlations 
with sodium in toluene, gave considerable diethoxy- 
methylphenylsilane with the consequent loss in 
yield of the product.
Lithium intermediate.  Although the dilithium 
derivatives form in good yields by an interchange 
reaction between p-dibromobenzene and butyl- 
lithium in petroleum ether,2 4  these intermediates 
were not convenient for the preparation of polv- 
functional phenylenedisilanes. Because of their 
great reactivity for both silicon-attached chloro 
and alkoxy groups, inverse addition of the pre­
formed dilithium compound to the silane was re­
quired. Preparation of the lithium reagent by ex­
change precludes the formation of the intermediate 
in the presence of the silane. p-Phenylenedilithium
(21) An attem pt was made to prepare t.hc p-(ehloro- 
diethoxysilyl-Af,AT-dimethylaniIine by the ethanolysis of p- 
(trichlorosilyl)-Ar,Ar-dimethylaniline in the presence of tri- 
ethylamine, which was used as an acid acceptor. The tri- 
ethylamine-chlorosilane complex was insoluble, even in a 
fairly large excess of toluene, and the low concentration of 
silane in solution gave mostly the trialkoxy product.

EXPERIMENTAL
A lk o x y  ch lo ro sila n es.  Chlorodiethoxymethylsilane, pre­
pared by the ethanolysis of trichloromethylsilane and sub­
sequent fractional distillation, contained little dichloro- 
ethoxymethylsilane but some triethoxymethylsilane.2 5  The 
chlorine equivalent was calculated on the basis of titration 
of a hydrolyzed aliquot of the silane.
Chloroet.hoxydimethylsilane was prepared by treating 903 
g. (7.0 moles) of dichlorodimet.hylsilane with 323 g. (7.0 
moles) of anhydrous alcohol and distilling the 32 g. of prod­
uct that distilled below 72°. The residue, which had a neu­
tralization equivalent of 139.1 (calcd. for C4 H nClSiO, 
138.7), was used directly in the condensation with the Gri- 
gnard reagent.
The syntheses of chlorodiethoxyphenylsilane, chloro-p- 
chlorophenvldiethoxysilane, and p-anisylchlorodiethoxysi- 
lane by ethanolysis of the chlorosilanes followed by frac­
tional distillation were described earlier.2 5  Pure p-(chlorodi- 
ethoxysilvl)-A’,A"-dimethylaniline was not obtained in the 
corresponding alcoholysis reaction, but the product which 
was mostly p - (triethoxysilyl j-Ar,A'-dimethylaniline, was used 
in the Grignard s}Tithesis.
A stirred mixture of 91 g. (0.36 mole) of p - (trichloro- 
silvl)-.V,Ar-dimethylaniline 218 g. (2.16 moles) of triethyl- 
amine, and 600 ml. of toluene was treated with 32.7 g. (0.71 
mole) of anhydrous ethanol by dropwise addition. The amine 
salts were removed by filtration and washed with a little 
toluene. Fractional distillation of the combined filtrate and 
washings gave 46 g. (45%) of the impure product boiling 
135-143° at 2 mm. (164-165° at 5 mm.).

lowing Gainer’s procedure1 4  were 11.5% of p-phenylenebis- 
(diethoxymethylsilane) and 30.1% of p-bromophenyldi- 
ethoxymethylsilane. In this procedure, 4 moles of p-dibromo­
benzene, 5 g.-atoms of magnesium and 6 moles of triethoxy­
methylsilane were allowed to react. When most of the ether 
was not removed by distillation prior to filtering the product, 
unchanged Grignard reagent was collected in the filtration 
residue. Distillation of the product gave unchanged p-di- 
bromobenzene in the forerun making it necessary to disas­
semble and clean the distillation apparatus before the prod­
ucts were collected. Redistillation of the higher boiling prod­
uct from these experiments through an Oldershaw column

Changing the stoichiometry of the reactants to 0.4 mole of

mole, total) of p-dibromobenzene, 338 g. (2 moles) of chloro- 
diethoxymethylsilane, and 450 ml. of tetrahydrofuran by 
dropwise addition over 2.5 hr. After the mixture was re­
fluxed 3 hr., it was cooled and filtered. Several additional 
filtrations were required to remove salts that separated when 
the filtrate was concentrated by distillation. The product, 
fractionally distilled at 5.5 mm., gave 114 g. (33.3%) of p- 
phenylenebis(diethoxymethylsilane) at 164°. Between 100- 
108°, 15.4 g. of a material was collected winch could not be 
purified by additional distillation. Analysis by vapor phase 
chromatography showed that this fraction contained about 
67% diethoxymethylphenylsilane, n™ 1.4664 (for an authen­
tic sample, n™ 1.4684). The conversion was 4%.
When triethoxymethylsilane was substituted for chloro- 
diethoxymethylsilane, the product obtained from 5.3 g. 
(0.22 g.-atom) of magnesium, 23.4 g. (0.1 mole) of p-di- 
bromobenzene, 28.5 g. (0.24 mole) of triethoxymethylsilane, 
and 90 ml. of tetrahydrofuran was refluxed for 8 hr. Distilla­
tion of a part of the tetrahydrofuran from the mixture gave 
two liquid phases. After 100 ml. of toluene was added, sol­
vents w rere again distilled from the mixture. The residue, 
w'hich gave a positive Gilman Color Tes* I, yielded only 
decomposition products during an attempted distillation.
A d d itio n  o f sila n e  to p re fo rm e d  G rig n a rd  reagent.  The Gri- 
gnard reagent, prepared in the usual maimer from 10.6 g. 
(0.44 g.-atom) of magnesium, 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, 
and 47.2 g. (0.2 mole) of p-dibromobenzene, was diluted with 
25 ml. of tetrahydrofuran and cooled to 20° to crystallize 
the Grignard-tetrahydrofuran complex. To the cold solution 
was added 75 ml. (0.44 mole) of chlorodiethoxvmethylsilane 
in rapid drops. After the product was refluxed 2 hr., proce­
dure A or B was used for purification. No p-bromophenyldi- 
ethoxvmethylsilane was collected during the distillations.
A. The salts were removed by filtration and the filtrate was 
concentrated by distillation. Fractional distillation of the 
residue gave 26.6 g. (38%) of p-phenylenebis(diethoxy- 
methvlsilane).
B. The product was poured into a mixture of 200 ml. of 
water, 200 ml. of toluene, 25 g. of sodium bicarbonate, and 
ice. The organic phase, separated, and washed with three 
100-ml. portions of water, was filtered and dried with Dri- 
erite. After the solvents were removed, 21.8 g. (32%) of p- 
phenylenebis(diethoxymethylsilane) was obtained by frac­
tional distillation.
In larger scale experiments (for example, with 2.4 moles of 
p-dibromobenzene) formation of the Grignard reagent re­
quired 24 hr. The temperature could not be maintained at 
20° during the addition of the silane because adequate stir­
ring of the thick mixture was not obtained. The average 
yield for two batches was 1 1.8%.
Substitution of p-dichlorobenzene for p-dibromobenzene 
gave only the monosilane. From 29.4 g. (C.2 mole) of p-di- 
chlorobenzene was obtained 16.0 g. (32.7%) of p-chloro-

mixture of 5.5 g. (0.24 g.-atom) of sodium and 30 ml. of

28.0 g. (0.093 mole) of p-bromophenyldiethoxymethylsilane 
and 20.0 g. (0.118 mole) of chlorodiethoxymethylsilane gave 
an exothermi reeaction which maintained a refluxing mix­
ture without external heating. The cooled product was 
filtered to remove the sodium halides and distilled at at­
mospheric pressure to remove the toluene and unchanged 
chlorodiethoxymethylsilane. Fractional distillation of the 
residue at 0.3 mm. gave 8.6 g. (27.0%) of phenylenebis(di-

a threefold excess of the silane was used.

with n = 1, 2 or 3, and the dehydration of these 
three structures has been studied. Although these 
three compounds form an homologous series, each 
loses water in a different manner.

At room temperature the equilibrium is far to 
the left, but in the presence of a drying agent such 
as lime, 2,2-dimethyl-l-oxa-2-silacyclopentane (II) 
is obtained in good yield by distillation, b.p. 
103°. In the absence of a drying agent, water and 
II codistilled and recombined on cooling to reform 
I.
The cyclic II polymerized readily at room tem­
perature in the presence of minute amounts of 
water, presumably to form products of the formula 
HO [ (CH3 )2 Si (CH2 ) 3O—] „H. In very carefully
dried receivers, the polymer was of sufficiently high 
molecular weight so as to be somewhat rubbery. 
In the presence of the moisture in conventionally 
dried glassware, the polymers remained as extremely 
viscous liquids.
1,8-Bis(hydroxymethyl)tetramethyldisiloxane  (III) 
was prepared by the method of Speier, et al.,2  3  *  2 4 8 2  
who noted that the compound was unstable 
even at room temperature and that heat caused the 
formation of water and a resinous mass which be­
came quite fluid on exposure to water. Some years 
later, an opportunity arose to re-examine III some­
what more closely. Distillation from lime caused the 
formation of 40 to 60% of a volatile product, the 
properties of which changed rapidly at room tem­
perature, much as described for II. The distillate 
reacted exothermally with very dilute hydrochloric 
acid or with glacial acetic acid. With the latter 
reagent 1,3-bis (acetoxymethyl) tetramethyldisil-
oxane formed. These phenomena are explained 
as being due to the changes summarized by Equa­
tions B.

Dehydration of III in the presence of a small 
amount of sulfuric acid caused the formation of 
unreactive products, part of which (15%) was ob­
tained as the cyclic ether, 2,2,6.6-tetramethyl-
l,4-dioxa-2,6-disilacyclohexane (VI), with the re­
mainder as a high boiling liquid polymer. These 
products were quite unlike those obtained with 
lime. Concentrated hydrochloric acid or refluxing 
dilute sodium hydroxide had no effect upon these 
products.

The cyclic VI and the polymer both had the same 
II1 NMR spectra. The polymer also formed the 
precipitate of boric oxide (Eq. D) characteristically 
obtained from siloxanes. From these data, along 
with analyses and general behavior, we feel the 
polymer is probably linear forms of VI with hy­
droxymethyl end groups.
The infrared spectrum of VI showed two strong 
absorption maxima, one at 10.15 p and one at
9.4 ¡i believed to be characteristic of the siloxane 
and ether bonds in a strained six-membered ring.
1,3-Bis{hydroxyethyl)tetramethyldisiloxane  (VIII) 
was prepared by the methanolysis of 1,3-bis- 
(acetoxyethyl)tetramethyldisiloxane. As isolated 
from the methanol, VIII was of reasonably high 
purity without further purification. When com­
pletely neutral, VIII was much more resistant to 
dehydration than I or III and distilled in the ex­
pected boiling range without change.
Elevated temperatures caused cleavage in VIII 
at the silicon-carbon bond of the hydroxyethyl 
group in the presence of even trace amounts 
of acid or base. Only dimethylpolysiloxanes re­
mained after the rapid evolution of ethylene had 
ceased. Acid catalysis promoted a fairly rapid

reaction accurately described by Equation F. 
Potassium hydroxide was also an effective cata­
lyst, but apparently promoted cleavage also by a 
second route leading to ethanol, according to 
Equation G. Freshly calcined lime was effective

2,2-Dimethyl-l-oxa-2-silacyclopenlane  (II). Seventy-five 
grams of I was distilled at 50 mm. The vapor temperature 
varied erratically but remained much too low to be correct 
for the disiloxane (I). The distillate showed striations 
initially and became very viscous, but the striations disap­
peared on standing with no agitation. Soon after the distilla­
tion, the distillate had the physical constants of I. This be­
havior suggested that I decomposed on distillation and re­
formed in the receiver according to Equation A.
To verify this, a 40-g. sample of I was distilled through a 
small column packed with dehydrated alumina pellets. The 
alumina adsorbed much of the product as well as the water, 
so that only 10 g. of distillate was obtained. This distillate, 
however, was the heterocyclic II, b.p. 32° at 50 mm.; 103° at 
740 mm.; ra2 D \  1.4415; 0.9178; Ra, 0.2880. Calcd. RD ,

The refractive index and density of this product changed 
rapidly after distillation. The indices reported above are 
those existing at the time the density was determined. The 
possibility of error cannot be disregarded. In 6 hr. the re­
fractive index rose to 1.4503 in a tightly closed bottle. In 7 
days it rose to 1.4535 6 as the product became a soft, gela­
tinous mass.

cyclic VI and showed no hydroxvl groups.

trifluoride etherate was placed in a 100-ml. round bottom 
flask attached to a small still head and heated. At 71°, 
ether started to distill. The temperature was gradually 
raised over a period of 3 hr. to the boiling point of the ethe­

coned, hydrochloric acid. After several days, most of the 
methanol and methyl acetate were removed by distillation. 
The residue was freed of all volatile compounds by a sweep 
of dry nitrogen at 100 mm. pressure up to a temperature of 
75°. A quantitative yield of clear, colorless, somewhat vis­
cous VIII was obtained having these properties: n2 d 5, 1.4432;

Distillation of neutral l,3-l>is{hydroxyeihyl)letramethyldi-  
siloxanc  (V III). In order to remove all traces of hydrochloric 
acid, 54 g. of A ' 111 was dissolved in 35 ml. of benzene and 
washed with a mixture of 35 ml. of coned, sodium chloride 
solution and 25 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solu­
tion. After a second washing with aqueous sodium chloride, 
the neutral organic solution was dried azeotropic-ally, filtered 
to remove traces of inorganic salts, and rendered free of sol­
vent. A final sweep with dry nitrogen at 70-80° and 100 m. 
pressure insured removal of the last traces of benzene; 
yield 50.3 g., »%, 1.4438.
A small sample (4.8 g.) was flash distilled. At a pressure 
of 5 mm., distillation proceeded smoothly, and 2.0 g. of dis­
tillate (boiling range 151-159°; n 1.4431) was collected 
before the temperature in the flask reached 200°. The resi­
due, still clear and colorless, weighed 2.8 g.; n°D 5, 1.4475. 
Inspection of the H 1 XMR spectra of this distillate, and the 
residue showed all three samples to have identical curves. 
These data indicate that VIII when completely neutral may 
be distilled without change.
C leavage of 1,3-bis{hydroxyethyl)tetramethyldisiloxane  
(VIII). a. Slightly acidic with hydrogen chloride.  A sample of 
V III containing a trace of hydrogen chloride decomposed 
when heated for distillation as above. No distillate was col­
lected up to a temperature of 200° in the flask, and a loss in 
weight occurred equal to that calculated for complete cleav­
age of ethylene from the molecule (Equation F).The experiment was repeated using 10.3 g. (0.046 mole) of 
VIII in a 50-in 1 . flask attached to a small condenser, a Dry 
Ice trap, and a gas collecting bottle in series. Evolution of gas 
commenced at 75° and a total of 1908 ml. (corr.), 92%, was 
collected up to a temperature of 220°, where the rate of 
evolution had essentially ceased. Most of the gas formed be­
low 150°. The flask had lost 3.5 g. (theory for loss of ethylene 
and water, 3.4 g.) and contained 6.8 g. of a clear, colorless, 
viscous fluid: irD 5, 1.4067; </% , 0.972; RD , 0.2531. Calcd. RD ,

ethylene.
b. I'nder alkaline conditions. Potassium hydroxide.  A mix­
ture of 10 g. (0.045 mole) of VIII and 0.3 g. of crushed, dry 
potassium hydroxide was heated as in (a). The evolution of 
gas started at 80° and continued to a temperature of 218°.
Only 1260 ml. (corr.) of the calculated amount of 2016 
ml. of gas was collected. Infrared analysis proved this to be 
ethylene. The cold trap contained 1.8 g., partly in the form 
of ice. Only 0.8 g. of water was expected. The contents of the 
cold trap smelled like ethanol, n 2 D 5 , 1.3651. The colorless 
residue was dissolved in benzene and washed free of potas­
sium hydroxide. It was then dried and devolatilized by a 
stream of nitrogen at 55° and 100 mm. It was essentially 
pure polvdimethylsiloxane: n’ %, 1.4037; d2 ,“, 0.966; Ro, 
0.2530 (calcd. Rn for [(CIRhSiO]*, 0.2521).
Anal.  Calcd. for (C 2H6OSi)„: Si, 37.9. Found, 37.8.
From these data it appears likely that the cleavage in the 
presence of alkali formed both ethylene with water as well 
as ethanol as outlined in Equations F and G.
c. With calcium oxide.  A mixture of 5 g. (0.0225 mole) of 
VIII and 2.5 g. of freshly calcined calcium oxide heated as 
above formed no gas until it reached 170°. The evolution of 
gas proceeded very slowly in this case. The experiment was 
continued up to a temperature of 218°, to obtain 780 ml. 
(corr.) of ethylene, 77% of theory according to Equation D. 
The trap contained only two drops of colorless liquid, n2 D 5, 
1.363, having the odor of ethanol. The residue weighed 6.5 g. 
The loss of 1.0 g. agrees with the 0.97 g. loss calculated for a 
77% yield of ethylene, assuming that the lime would absorb 
the water also formed.
The residue was diluted with hexane, filtered free of the 
lime and worked up as in (a) and (b) above to give 3.0 g. of

Diallyldimethylsilane has been polymerized with Ziegler-type catalysts to give soluble polymers containing cyclic recurring 
units.
The formation of polymers containing cyclic 
recurring units by intermolecular-intramoleeular 
polymerization of nonconjugated olefins is now well 
established. For example,2  diallyl diethyl am­
monium bromide (I) gives a soluble polymer con­
taining recurring piperidine units (II). Similarly,

Ziegler-type catalyst of aluminumtriisobutyl and

soluble polymers ranging from moderately viscous

From the preliminary experiments, it seems ap­
parent that the polymerization conditions (amount 
of solvent, catalyst ratios, etc.) have a marked 
effect on both the yield and molecular weight of

(0.9-10% yields) of insoluble, presumably cross- 
linked polymers, were obtained. Yields of the sol­
uble polymers ranged from 13-91% and in most 
cases they were very sticky, glassy semi.solids. 
These polymers dissolved completely in benzene, 
heptane, and chloroform. The results are tabulated 
in Table I.
The polymer sample from reaction 266A was 
purified thoroughly by four reprecipitations from 
benzene solutions into methanol. The soluble por­
tion was able to be divided into two fractions: 
a white solid, completely insoluble in methanol-ben­
zene solution but freely soluble in benzene (vis­
cosity 0.22), and a viscous oil, moderately soluble 
in methanol-benzene (viscosity 0.04) which was 
recovered by boiling off the solvent. These fractions 
possessed identical infrared spectra (taken in 2.5% 
solution in chloroform), which contained the fol­
lowing bands (cm.-1): 2905 (—C—H stretch): 
1441 (—CH 2— deformation, normal): 1409 (— 
CH2 — deformation, lowered for CH2  groups next 
to Si atom); 1339 (—CH< deformation): 1248, 
838 (—Si(CH3 )2 —). In both cases, a very weak 
band was obtained at 1631 cm.-1 (residual double 
bond). A quantitative comparison of these poly­
mer samples with diallyldimethylsilane (2.5% 
solution in chloroform) showed that there were 6.0% 
of the monomer units incorporated in the polymer 
chain which still retained one double bond. The 
identical amounts of residual unsaturation in both 
fractions appear to indicate that, except for molecu­
lar weight, the same type of polymer linkage is 
present in each. The infrared studies are thoroughly 
consistent with polymer structure IV containing 
cyclic recurring units. The fraction with the higher 
viscosity was obtained analytically pure and, on 
heating, softened and shrank slightly between 100° 
and 300°. Above 300° it began to turn yellow and 
at 376° it formed a clear amber melt. When this 
sample was heated above 300° for more than a few 
minutes, it began to decompose noticeably.
At this point we learned that Dr. G. B. Butler of 
the University of Florida was working on this same 
general problem and we discontinued our work 
(9-20-58).6

bromide was made in the usual manner 7 using the following 
quantities of reagents: allvl bromide (200 g., 1.66 moles), 
magnesium (97 g., 4.0 g.-atoms), and anhydrous ether (1.5 
I.). This solution was decanted into another flask and a solu­
tion of allyldimethylchlorosilane (135 g., 1.0 mole) in 300 
ml. of anhydrous ether was dropped in at reflux temperature. 
The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 hr. and hydrolyzed 
with a saturated solution of ammonium chloride. The ether 
layer was distilled three times through a 55-cm. packed glass 
column to yield diallyldimethylsilane (112 g., 80% yield) 
of b.p. 134-135° (at about 750 mm), 1.4380. [Petrov

An infrared spectrum of this compound exhibited the 
following bands (cm.-1): 3070, 2960, 2900 (C—H); 1632

made up in the usual manner .3 The polymer obtained from 
reaction 266A was fractionated into two components by 
repeated reprecipitation from benzene solution into metha­
nol. Fraction 266A-1 was a white, powdery solid, completely 
insoluble in methanol-benzene solutions, but soluble in 
benzene, chloroform, and heptane. Fraction 266A-2 was a 
moderately viscous oil, soluble in methanol-benzene and 
isolated by boiling off the solvent. This oily fraction repre­
sented approximately two thirds of the soluble polymer ob­
tained. No effort was made to fractionate samples 266B- 
266G. The small amounts of insoluble polymer produced 
in each reaction were removed by filtering benzene solutions 
of the original crude polymers from the first reprecipitations. 
Fine mesh wire screening or ordinary filter paper were used. 
All samples were purified by reprecipitation and freeze- 
dried from benzene.
The following physical and chemical data on soluble poly­
mers 266A-1 and 266A-2 were obtained:

Diallyldimethylsilane and diallyldiphenylsilane have been polymerized with triethylaluminum-titanium tetrachloride 
complex catalyst to yield soluble polymers.
During the period following the original proposal2  
that 1,6-heptiidienes can polymerize by an alter­
nating intra-intermolecular mechanism to produce 
soluble, linear polymers, a wide variety of such 
monomers and the resulting polymers have been 
prepared and studied.3  We now wish to report the 
synthesis and results of the polymerization studies 
of diallyldimethylsilane and diallyldiphenylsilane.
While both monomers studied in this work have 
previously been reported,9 ’1 1  their significance was 
not realized until the advent of the intra-inter­
molecular mechanism for polymerization of 1,6- 
dienes and tihe Ziegler-type catalysts for poly­
merization of hydrocarbons. A kinetic study of 
radical catalyzed polymerization of allyltrimethyl- 
silane and diallyldimethylsilane has been made,4  
and low molecular weight polymers were reported. 
More recently, polymerization of diallyldimethyl­
silane and diallyldiethylsilane by use of a triethyl- 
aluminum-titanium tetrachloride complex cata­
lyst has been reported.5  These authors reported 
that both liquid and solid polymers were obtained. 
From the liquids could be isolated trimers, 
tetramers, and pentamers; however, the solid 
polymers were insoluble in ether, benzene, and 
carbon tetrachloride, but swelled in heptane.
The polymers reported in this study are soluble 
in benzene. The absence of unsaturation in the

using 1.5 1 . (1.5 equivalents) of ally] Grignard reagent and

tions was prepared in a dry box. Triethylaluminum was dis­
solved in heptane; this was followed by the addition of a 
measured quantity of titanium tetrachloride which ap­
peared to react immediately to give a brown suspension. 
After the flask was capped and removed from the dry box, 
the monomer was added, with stirring, to the suspension. 
The contents of the flask were then heated to the specified 
temperature. After varying intervals o: time the poly­
merization mixtures were poured into methanol to decom­
pose the catalyst.

polymerization of diallvldimethylsilaiie. Purification of the 
polymers was accomplished by dissolving them in benzene; 
the resulting solution was poured into methanol from which 
the compounds precipitated. The analytical samples were 
obtained by repeating this process at least four times. The 
purified polymers melted between 80° and 11 0° and began 
to darken between 300° and 330° (open capillary). The infra­
red spectrum exhibits peaks for aliphatic hydrogen (2900- 
2800 cm.-1) and for silicon dimethyl (7260-1240 cm.-1, 
815-800 cm.-1). The bands for the double bond (1640 cm.-1) 
and for the terminal methylene group (895 cm.-1) are ab­
sent from the spectrum. An intrinsic viscosity determination 
in benzene gave a value of 0.13.

peroxide as an initiator. The polymers were purified in a 
similar manner. The polymer obtained with 1.2% peroxide 
melted at 80-100° and began to darken at 280°. The infra­
red spectrum was similar to that of the Ziegler catalyst- 
initiated polymer but there were small peaks for the double 
bond (1640 cm.-1) and for the terminal methylene group 
(895 cm.-1) indicating some residual unsaturation.

polymerization of diallyldiphenylsilane. The method used 
for purifying the polymers was the same as that with poly­
diallyldimethylsilane. The polymers obtained melted from
125-155° and began to darken above 330° (open capillary). 
The weight-average molecular weight, as obtained by light 
scattering measurements ,13 was 6.0 X 104 . A value of 0.065 
was found for the intrinsic viscosity' on a benzene solution 
of the polymer. The infrared spectrum possesses peaks for 
phenylsilicon (1430 cm.-1, 1110 cm.-1), aliphatic hydrogen 
(2900 cm.-1), and aromatic hydrogen (3030 cm.-1). The 
spectrum exhibits no absorption for the double bond (1641

Polymerizations carried out on diallyldiphenylsilane with 
di-i-butyl peroxide gave similar polymers. A polymer pre­
pared with 6% peroxide had a melting range of 115-140° 
and began to darken at 315°. An intrinsic viscosity of 0.04 
was obtained for a sample of this polymer dissolved in 
benzene. The infrared spectrum of this polymer and the 
infrared spectrum of the Ziegler catalyst-initiated polymer 
are identical.

Twelve chlorinated aromatic silicates were synthesized from phenols with either chlorosilanes or ethyl orthosilicate, and 
from sodium phenates and silicon tetrachloride. Phenol and di-i-butoxydiaminosilar.e formed diphenoxydi-2-butoxysilane. 
All the compounds were white solids or colorless liquids having a wide liquid range, and they all had a strong phenolic 
odor even when highly purified. The hydrolytic stability of the chlorinated aromatic silicates, even those in which all ortho  
positions were blocked, was no better than that of unchlorinated aromatic silicates. The intrinsic thermal stability of 2- 
chlorophenyl orthosilicate was about the same as that, of cresyl silicate, but was decidedly inferior to cresyl silicate in the 
presence of metals at 400°.
Although aromatic orthosilicates have been 
known since 1885 1  and have recently been of­
fered commercially,1  2  little has been reported about 
chlorinated aromatic silicates.3-6 We have synthe­
sized a variety of chlorinated aromatic silicates, 
including some with both ortho  positions blocked, 
with the thought that these compounds might 
have enhanced hydrolytic stability.
The compounds prepared are listed in Table I 
together with their physical properties, analyses 
and methods of synthesis. All the materials were 
white solids or colorless liquids having a wide 
liquid range, and they all had a strong phenolic 
odor even when highly purified.
We applied conventional methods of synthesis 
to the preparation of these compounds, i.e., re­
action of: A) phenols with chlorosilanes1 ’ 6;  B) 
sodium phenates with silicon tetrachloride7 * ;  C) 
phenols with ethyl orthosilicate; and D) one phenol 
with an aminosilane. The application of these 
methods to the preparation of analogous compounds 
has recently been described 4  5 .3
The method of synthesis involving the reaction 
of silicon tetrachloride with chlorophenols proved 
quite satisfactory with those having no more than 
one ortho  substituent. With 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 
no reaction occurred with boiling silicon tetrachlo­
ride. The sodium salts of both 2,4,6-trichlorophenol 
and pentachlorophenol reacted satisfactorily with 
silicon tetrachloride to give the corresponding 
orthosilicates. The acid-catalyzed reaction of 
phenols with ethyl orthosilicate gave both chloro- 
phenoxysilanes and chlorophenoxyethoxysilanes,

Thus, the presence of i-alkoxy groups enhanced 
the hydrolytic stability of the neighboring phenoxy

alkoxy groups.8  It seems probable that f-alkoxy 
groups would similarly impart enhanced hydrolyf ic 
stability to neighboring chlorophenoxy groups.
The thermal stability of 2-chlorophenyl ortho­
silicate was evaluated both in the presence and 
absence of air and metals. This compound proved 
to be superior to cresyl silicate and methyl silicone 
oil at 250° in the presence of air, and it was com­
parable to cresyl silicate in being superior to 
methyl silicone oil at 350° in the absence of air. 
However, 2-chlorophenyl silicate proved to be 
decidedly inferior to cresyl silicate in the presence 
of common metals at 350° to 400° in the absence of 
air.

purification was as follows: 2-chlorophenol, redistilled b.p.80° at 28 mm., m.p. 7°, it™  1.5590; 4-chlorophenol, m.p.

after decolorizing and reerystallization from benzene-

and ethyl orthosilicate from Carbide and Carbon Chemicals 
Corp. were used as received. The methylchlorosilanes were 
supplied by the Silicone Products Department of the 
General Electric Company. Di-£-butoxydiaminosilane was 
obtained from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing 
Co.

appeared feasible, but we did not use this method extensively 
because of the isomeric mixtures likely to be obtained. 
Bubbling chlorine through a carbon tetrachloride solution

sisted of a round bottom flask fitted with a dropping funnel 
thermometer well, and tap-water cooled reflux condenser 
surmounted by a Dry Ice— trichloroethylene cold finger, 
from which an exit line led through a drying tube and a 
water scrubber to the atmosphere. The cold finger was 
necessary to prevent serious loss of volatile chlorosilane 
starting materials by entrainment with evolved hydrogen 
chloride.
The chlorosilanes were added gradually to the stoichi­
ometric amount of molten phenol, and the temperature of the 
reaction mixture was raised to 200° to 300° over a period of 
7 to 20 hr. as permitted by the rate of refluxing and hydrogen 
chloride evolution. The shorter reaction times were realized 
in syntheses involving p-chlorophenol. The presence of a 
single o rth o -c h lo ro  substituent retarded the reaction con­
siderably, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol did not react with boil­
ing silicon tetrachloride.
The reactions of phenols with chlorosilanes were con­
sidered complete when the evolution of hydrogen chloride 
ceased and the theoretical weight loss had been attained. 
Completeness of reaction was found to be essential; other­
wise the products were contaminated with difficultly 
removable by-products containing hydrolyzable chlorine. 
Use of excess phenol would probably be of value in this con­
nection. While we used stoichiometric amounts of reactants, 
an excess of phenol actually prevailed, because of slight losses 
of chlorosilane by entrainment with hydrogen chloride. Too 
large an excess, particularly of the more volatile phenols, 
might unduly restrict the final reaction temperature and 
thus lead to incomplete reaction.
Distillation and/or recrystallization from hexane or 
chlorobenzene produced, on a 0.5- to 5.0-kg. scale, yields of 
60 to 90% of purified product.
B. S ilic o n  te tra c h lo rid e  w ith  s o d iu m  p h e n a te s.  The sodium 
phenate was prepared by portion-wise addition of the 
theoretical amount of freshly cut sodium to a stirred, 
refluxing solution of the phenol in xylene. The preparation 
usually required about 0.5 hr. per mole, and 500 ml. to 1000 
ml. of xylene was used per 100 g. of phenol.
The theoretical amount of silicon tetrachloride was then 
added to the cold, stirred sodium phenate suspension, and 
the reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 hr. Negative halogen 
tests on the reflux indicated the absence of unreacted silicon 
tetrachloride.
The precipitated salt was removed by filtration, and xylene 
was removed by distillation. Vacuum distillation and/or 
recrystallization from heptane or chlorobenzene produced, 
on a 100-g. scale, yields of 30% of purified product.
C. E th y l o rth o silic a te  w ith  p h e n o ls.  The acid-catalyzed 
reaction of phenols with ethyl orthosilicate gave both tetra- 
(chlorophenoxy) silanes and chlorophenoxyethoxysilanes, 
depending upon the molar ratio of reactants. The reactions 
were carried out on a 200-g. scale by heating a mixture of 
ethyl orthosilicate, chlorophenol, and a few tenths of a 
gram of p-toluenesulfonic acid. At pot temperatures of 
170-320°, the theoretical amount of ethanol was removed by 
distillation over a period of 10 hr. The crude products 
were purified by distillation and/or recrystallization from 
heptane .1 0

H y d r o ly s is .  The chlorinated aromatic silicates show'ed 
hydrolytic stability comparable to that of unsubstituted 
aromatic silicates .11 Two gram samples of diethoxydi (2,4,6- 
trichlorophenoxy)silane and ethoxytri(2,4,6-trichlorophen- 
oxy)silane were boiled with distilled water for 2 hr. and steam 
distilled. The steam distillate contained appreciable amounts 
of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, m.p. and mixed m.p. 68-69°. 
The residue from the steam distillation contained silica, 
a white solid which was solvent-insoluble and did not fuse 
on being heated to 340°. Roughly the same sensitivity 
toward boiling water was observed with tetra(2,4,6-tri- 
chlorophenoxy)silane and tetra(pentachlorophenoxy)silane.
On the other hand, di-i-butoxydiphenoxysilane survived 
boiling with water, but was extensively hydrotyzed by 
boiling 10% sulfuric acid. The extent of hydrolysis was 
following by testing the steam distillate with bromine water, 
which is reactive toward phenol but was relatively inert 
toward ¿-butyl alcohol and di-i-butoxydiphenoxysilane. 
When the latter was boiled with water for half an hour, 
the steam distillate showed no reaction with bromine water. 
How'ever, upon boiling witih 10% sulfuric acid, the steam 
distillate gave a strong test for phenol, and a gelatinous 
precipitate appeared in the reaction flask.

substances in open Pyrex Petri dishes in the same oven.

° These losses probably included a major proportion of 
simple volatilization loss. 6 Both a commercial sample of 
eresyl silicate and a sample prepared from it by careful 
fractional distillation gave the same results.
Tests were then carried out at 350° by heating under dry 
nitrogen, in Pyrex flasks fitted with reflux condensers. 
After 10 hr., both commercial eresyl silicate and 2-chloro­
phenyl silicate showed only a slight darkening. In neither 
case were solid or gummy by-products formed. The heating 
of 2-chlorophenyl silicate at 350° was continued. After 45 
hr., there was no weight loss or viscosity increase; after 114 
hr. (which accidentally included 0.5 hr. at 450°), there was 
a 1.5% weight loss and a 2-centistokes increase in viscosity.
(11) Similar, if not more pronounced, hydrolytic insta­
bility was found in chlorinated aromatic borates. These 
were prepared by refluxing the appropriate ehlorophenols 
with ethyl borate, which produced the theoretical amount 
of ethanol and substances presumed to be tri( 2-chloro- 
phenoxy)borane, b.p. 236-258° at 8 mm., and tri(2,4,6- 
trichlorophenoxy)borane, b.p. 267-271° at 10 mm. Both 
compounds were difficult to purity, presumably because of 
sensitivity to atmospheric moisture and traces of water. 
We were unable to obtain them pure in crystalline form in 
spite of efforts to exclude moisture. The synthesis of tri- 
(2-chlorophenoxy)borane, b.p. 242° at 6 mm., m.p. 47- 
49°, has been reported; it was described as being very sus­
ceptible to hydrolysis by L. H. Thomas, J .  C h e m . S o c .,  820

At the end of this treatment, the 2-chlorophenyl silicate 
was blackened but contained no sludge.
Thermal stability in the presence of metals was investi­
gated by heating with metal strips unde' dry nitrogen in 
Pvrex flasks fitted with reflux condensers. Commercial 
cresyl silicate survived heating with black iron for 140 hr. 
at 350° substantially unchanged. Under the same conditions, 
2-chlorophenyl silicate underwent a fivefold viscosity 
increase with black iron and a tenfold viscosity increase 
with cold-rolled steel and stainless steel. In another test at 
400° for 50 hr. in the presence of cold-rolled steel, 2-chloro­
phenyl silicate decomposed to a black, sticky, solid mass 
while commercial cresyl silicate survived substantially 
unaffected.Acknowledgment.  We are grateful to the follow­

The purpose of this work was to develop a general method of synthesis for a polyamide containing free sulfhydrvl groups. 
Polyamides from hexamethylene diamine and the acid chlorides of «,ar'-dibenzylthioadipic acid, the cyclic disulfide of a.a'-  
dimercaptoadipic acid, and a,a'-dicarbobenzoxythioadipic acid were prepared by the interfacial polymerization technique. 
Successful preparation of the polyamide with free sulfhydryl groups was achieved by quantitative removal of the carbo- 
benzoxy group from the polyamide from hexamethylene diamine and a,a'-dicarbobenzoxythioadipic acid.
The importance of the sulfhydryl compounds in  
biological systems is well known 3  In addition,  
their interest as reversible meroaptide-forming  
reagents as well as their recent applications as  
radioactive prophylactics has made synthesis of  
sulfhydryl-containing compounds of practical sig­
nificance. We have reported4  the synthesis of a  
polyurethan containing the sulfhydryl function in  
a structure of known constitution and environment  
and in this publication will describe the preparation  
of a sulfhydryl-containing polyamide.
The synthesis of polyamides requires, in general,  
exact molecular equivalence of reactants as well  
as very stringent reaction conditions, temperatures  
of 250° and above not being uncommon. The two  
synthetic approaches described, sought in the  
first instance to use a convenient method for ob­
taining the desired molecular equivalence, e.g., 
intermediate salt formation, and in the second to  
employ a recently published5  procedure for making

reaction conditions, i.e., interfacial polycondensa­
tion.
Benzylthiomethylsuccinic acid4  would be ex­
pected to form a polymeric salt with a diamine  
suitable for subsequent polymerization by thermal  
dehydration. Only oils were obtained with hexa­
methylene diamine however, and with ethylene  
diamine a salt containing two acid molecules to one  
molecule of diamine was obtained. The unavail­
ability of the second carboxyl group for salt forma­
tion is at present not understood.
We prepared meso-a, a'-dibenzylthioadipic acid  
by alkali-catalyzed displacement by benzyl mer­
captan on meso-a,  a'-dibromoadipic acid prepared  
by the method of Zanden6  and found that it did  
not give a satisfactorily recrystallizable salt with  
ethylene diamine. A melting point range of 25°  
was observed even after five recrystallizations, as  
well as a small residue of the acid on addition of  
water.
The use of the cis cyclic disulfide of a,a'-dimer-  
captoadipic acid7  prepared by Fredga, again did  
not yield a satisfactorily recrystallizable salt with  
hexamethylene diamine. Attempted thermal poly­
merization without recrystallization yielded an  
insoluble, infusible product. Cross-linking by a base  
catalyzed rupture of the disulfide bond8  and/or

a disulfide interchange mechanism analogous to  
the thermal polymerization of lipoic acid9  is pos­
sible here.
Interfacial polycondensation was then considered.  
This method depended only on the ability to pre­
pare the necessary diacid chlorides. Neither benzyl-  
thiomethylsuccinic acid nor carbobenzoxymercapto-  
succinic acid gave the desired compounds even  
by methods yielding the acid halides of related  
succinic acid derivatives.1 0  1 1  The correspondingstanding at room temperature overnight. When tri-  
fluoroacetic acid saturated with hydrogen bromide  
was employed the reaction was completed in half  
an hour yielding a base-soluble polyamide. The  
product was fusible and gave a weak but definitive  
absorption peak at 2550 cm.-1, characteristic of  
the sulfhydryl function. Elemental analysis showed  
that 100% decarbobenzoxylation had been ef­
fected, a remarkable result for a polymeric re­
action.

anhydrides were predominantly obtained pos­
sibly by sulfur participation in the transition state.  
Standard methods did, however, convert a ,a -  
dibenzylthioadipic acid, the cis cyclic disulfide  
of a,a'-dimercaptoadipic acid, and a new acid,  
a,a'-dicarbobenzoxythioadipic acid to the cor­
responding acid chlorides. The acid halides were  
readily converted to their polyamides with hexa-  
methvlene diamine, by both a manually stirred  
and a film-forming interface method.
Neither the polyamide derived from the cyclic  
disulfide nor the a,a'-dibenzylthioadipic acid could  
be reductively cleaved to the desired free sulfhydryl  
compounds, presumably because of their insolu­
bility in the reaction media. The polyamide derived  
from the epa'-dicarbobenzoxythioadipic acid did,  
however, when treated with glacial acetic acid  
saturated with hydrogen bromide, yield an insol­
uble material which showed an absence of phenyl  
absorption in the infrared in what appeared to be  
a heterogeneous cleavage. A more rapid cleavage  
where subsequent oxidative coupling of the free  
thiol residues could be minimized was necessary  
and trifluoroacetic acid gave the desired results.  
Analysis indicated that up to 30% decarbobenzoxyl­
ation occurred in the trifluoroacetic acid alone on

a,a'-Dibenzylthioadipic acid.  A general method of Zan-

2. Continuous film method.  A  solution of 4.27 g. (0.01 mole) 
of the acid chloride in 75 ml. of purified carbon tetrachloride 
was carefully overlaid with a solution containing 7.54 g. 
(0.065 mole) of hexamethylene diamine and 0.8 g. (0.02 
mole) of sodium hydroxide in 75 ml. of water. The film which 
formed immediately at the interface was separated from the 
walls of the beaker and withdrawn as a continuous filament. 
The product was washed with aqueous ethanol and with 
benzene and dried in vacuo.  The resulting yellow tinged solid 
did not dissolve or swell in a variety of solvents and was in­
fusible. It gave an infrared spectrum virtually identical with 
that of the previously described sample.
II. Polyamide from acid chloride of cyclic disulfide.  1. Stir­
ring method.  A  solution of 2.45 g. (0.01 mole) of the crude cy­
clic acid chloride previously described was dissolved in 50 
ml. of chloroform and overlaid with a solution containing
1.85 g. (0.016 mole) of hexamethylene diamine and 0.8 g. 
(0.02 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 50 ml. of water. A  
voluminous solid formed rapidly and after a few minutes of 
stirring was isolated bj' filtration. This material was totally 
insoluble in a variety of solvents and was infusible. When 
washed with benzene and dimethylsulfoxide and dried, the 
product, gave an infrared spectrum consistent with the ex­
pected structure, but an elemental analysis which was not 
satisfactory, having low carbon and sulfur. (12) I,. Schotte, Arhip Kemi,  9, 377 (1956).

2. Continuous film method.  A solution of 2.45 g. (0.01 mole) 
of the acid chloride in 50 ml. of purified carbon tetrachloride 
was carefully overlaid with a solution of 7.54 g. (0.005 mole) 
of hexamethylene diamine containing 0.8 g. ( 0.02 mole) of 
sodium hydroxide in 50 ml. of water. The film which formed 
immediately was separated from the walls of t he beaker and 
withdrawn continuously until the reaction was completed 
which generally coincided with the disappearance of the 
organic layer. This material was again insoluble and infusi­
ble. When washed with aqueous ethanol and benzene and 
thoroughly dried in vacuo,  the resulting yellow solid gave an 
infrared spectrum consistent, with the expected structure 
but an elemental analysis which was not satisfactory, having 
low' carbon and sulfur.
3. Solution method.  A solution of 2.45 g. (0.01 mole) of the 
acid chloride in 50 ml. of purified dioxane was rapidly mixed 
with a solution containing 1.16 g. ( 0.01 mole) of hexamethyl- 
ene diamine and 1.12 g. (0.02 mole) of potassium hydroxide 
in 50 ml. of dioxane. A yellow solid formed almost im­
mediately in a somewhat, exothermic reaction. The product 
was isolated by filtration but proved to be totally insoluble 
in a variety of solvents and infusible.
4. Salt formation method.  (non-interfacial procedure).  A 
sample of the acid 131.7 mg. (0.64 mole) was dissolved in 
anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. A solution of hexamethylene 
diamine dissolved in tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise 
until no further precipitation occurred. The salt was filtered 
and dried in vacuo  to constant, weight, yielding a white solid 
which was completely water soluble, 212 mg. ( 102%), m.p. 
188-194°. The material could not. be recrystallized, how­
ever, from a variety of solvents. The crude material was 
heated at 200-205°, 1  mm., for 1  hr. The product was a 
somewhat yellowish solid which proved to be insoluble and 
infusible.
C. Polymer from hexamethylene diamine and a,n'-dicar-  
bobenzoxythioadipoyl chloride.  1. Stirring method.  A  solution 
of 2.74 g. (0.0055 mole) of a,a'-dicarbobenzoxythioadipoyl 
chloride in 50 ml. of methylene chloride (chloroform gave a 
product of the same physical properties) was poured into a 
cold solution containing 1.6 g. (0.013 mole) of hexamethylene 
diamine and 0.67 g. (0.011 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 
50 ml. of water. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 hr. 
and the product isolated by filtration. The crude material 
could be separated into two fractions by extraction with di- 
methylformamide or trifluoroacetic acid. The soluble frac­
tion isolated from the trifluoroacetic acid extract, in no case 
exceeded 25% of total solids, m.p. 118-123°, [ 1 7], 0.43 deter­

(0.014 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 50 ml. of water. The 
film which formed almost immediately at the interface was 
separated from the walls of the beaker and pulled from the 
reaction mixture. The product, was washed repeatedly with 
portions of aqueous ethanol and benzene, and dried in vacuo.  
The resulting light yellow solid could be separated into two 
fractions with hot dimethylformamide. The soluble frac­

Triethyl-, tri-rc-propyl-, and tri-n-butylborane were prepared and fractionated under an inert atmosphere to prevent oxi­
dation. Triethylborane and tri-n-propylborane were obtained in purities of 99.8 and 99.7 mole percent, respectively, while 
tri-n-butvlborane underwent thermal decomposition during distillation. The following physical and thermodynamic prop­
erties of triethylborane and tri-n-propylborane were determined: freezing point, boiling point, refractive index, density, 
dielectric constant, and heat of combustion.
As part of an evaluation program of boron com­
pounds as potential high-energy fuels, a survey was 
made of the properties of the trialkylboranes. 
It was noted that the literature offered values for 
only some of the properties of current interest2-7 
and that among these values there were occasional 
discrepancies. Since the trialkylboranes are ex­
tremely susceptible to air oxidation, it was felt 
that the discrepancies in the property values might 
well be due to the presence of small amounts of 
oxidation products in the material. With this in 
mind the preparation, purification, and measure­
ment of several properties of triethyl-, tri-n- 
propyl-, and tri-n-butylborane were undertaken 
in an inert environment.
Triethyl- and tri-n-propylborane were prepared 
in purities of 99.8 and 99.7 mole percent, respec­
tively. Tri-n-butylborane was not obtained in a 
pure form, since it readily decomposed during 
distillation.8
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
P h y s i c a l  -p ro p e rtie s.  Table I presents freezing 
points, boiling points, refractive indices, densities, 
and dielectric constants for triethyl- and tri-n- 
propylborane. The molar refractions were calculated 
by means of the Lorentz-Lorenz equation from the 
values for refractive index and density.
An examination of the values listed in Table I, 
when compared with the previous literature values 
(footnotes a to h ) , in several instances, shows 
discrepancies that cannot be explained in terms

discrepancies presents itself when the trends in the 
values are noted. The refractive index reported 
for tri-n-propylborane7  is lower and the densities 
for triethylborane and tri-n-propylboraneE '7  are 
higher than the values obtained in this present in­
vestigation. When a trialkylborane is oxidized, 
the product is an alkvldialkoxyborane.9  Although 
no refractive index and density data are available 
for these compounds where R = ethyl or propyl, 
there are data for the closely related trialkoxy- 
boranes.1 0  The trialkylboranes, when compared 
with the corresponding trialkoxyboranes, are found 
to have higher refractive indices (approx. 0.02 
higher) and lower densities (approx. 0.15 g./ml. 
lower). The alkyldialkoxyboranes would be ex­
pected to have refractive index and density values 
between those of the trialkylboranes and the tri­
alkoxyboranes. This contention holds for the case 
where R = butyl.1 0  Therefore, it would be ex­
pected that contamination of the trialkylboranes 
with their oxidation products would tend to lower 
the refractive index and elevate the density values 
beyond those of the pure compound.
The above explanation was further substantiated 
by a crude experiment run on a sample of tri-n- 
propylborane. The sample was placed in a refrac- 
tometer and then exposed to air. The refractive in­
dex was observed to decrease rapidly, over period 
of several seconds, as the sample oxidized.
Experimental values for the refractive index 
of triethylborane and the dielectric constant of 
triethyl- and tri-n-propylborane are reported here 
for the first time.

The values for the heats of combustion of triethyl- 
and tri-n-propylborane are listed in Table II. 
The uncertainty associated with the over-all raw 
heat-of-combustion determination was about 0.3%, 
and that associated with the estimation of un­
burned material and the corrections thereof was 
about 0.2%. The over-all uncertainty was there­
fore estimated to be 0.5%.

Materials.  Ethyl, «-propyl, and «-butyl bromide were 
washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate 
and distilled. The refractive indices of the purified bromides 
were r2 d ° 1.4242, 1.4341, and 1.4399, respectively. Matheson 
boron trifluoride, 91 Tc pure, was used directly from the 
cylinder. The ethyl ether was dried over calcium hydride. 
The butyl ether was percolated through a column packed 
with activated aluminum oxide and dried over calcium hy­
dride.
Preparation. Tri-n-butyl and lri-n-propylborane.  A modifi­
cation of the procedure of Johnson, Snyder, and Van Cam- 
pen1 9  was used. The preparation of tri-n-butylborane is de­
scribed to illustrate the procedure.
n-Butylmagnesium bromide was prepared in a 5-gal. 
stainless steel reactor by the addition of 20 moles of n-butyl 
bromide in 3 1 . of ethyl ether to 20 moles of magnesium 
turnings in 2 1 . of ethyl ether. The Grignard solution was 
stored in a 5-gal. tank under nitrogen until needed. An 
ether solution of boron trifluoride etherate was prepared 
by the slow addition, with stirring, of 6 moles of boron tri- 
fluoride to 2 1 . of ethyl ether at 10°.
The apparatus for the preparation of tri-n-butylborane 
consisted of a 12-1. three-neck flask equipped with a stirrer, a 
large capacity stainless steel condenser, and a graduated

dropping funnel. The entire apparatus ■ p u is  enclosed in a 
dry box under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Three liters of Grigard solution were siphoned into the 12-1. 
flask from the storage tank. Then boron trifluoridc etherate 
solution was added with stirring at such a rate (about 250 
ml./hr.) as to promote vigorous refluxing. After approxi­
mately 650 ml. of the boron trifluoride etherate solution had 
been added, the reaction mixture separated quite suddenly 
into two layers, the bottom layer apparently consisted of 
Grignard solution and magnesium salts. This layer, which 
was black with white saltlike solid suspended throughout it, 
reacted vigorously with water, evolving gas. The clear pale 
yellow top layer showed no reaction with water and was ap­
parently an ether solution of tri-n-butylborane. This top 
layer was siphoned into a large separatory funnel through a 
tube having a sintered-glass disk fused on one end to act as 
a filter. When the entire top layer had been removed, an­
other 3-1. portion of Grignard reagent was added to the re­
action flask, and the entire procedure was repeated. A  total 
of 8300 ml. of Grignard solution and 5.9 moles of boron tri- 
fluoride etherate was used. There was a slight excess of 
(irignard reagent remaining after the las: of the boron tri­
fluoride had reacted.
The top layers obtained from the above reaction were 
washed in the separatory funnel with a saturated aqueous 
solution of ammonium chloride and then with water. Finally 
the ether solution was transferred to a dis* illation flask, and 
the ether was removed by vacuum distillation. The liquid 
residue, which contained a small amount of salt, was filtered. 
The total weight of crude produce was 989 g.; the yield was 
91% based on boron trifluoride.
Triethylborane.  Ten moles of this compound were pre­
pared in a 5-gal. reactor by the method of Krause and 
Nitsehe.4  Throughout the entire operation a positive pres­
sure of helium was maintained in the reactor to exclude 
oxygen.
Purification.  The crude reaction products were distilled 
through a 22-nun. by 6-ft. Podbielniak column. The entire 
distillation setup was enclosed in a dry box inerted with 
helium.
Triethylborane was distilled at atmospheric pressure, 
while tri-n-propylborane and tri-.n-buty’borane were dis­
tilled at pressures of 20 and 10 mm., respectively. Triethyl­
borane and tri-n-propylborane were successfully distilled, 
but tri-n-butylborane decomposed during distillation. The 
decomposition products of tri-n-butylborane adulterated 
the distillate besides causing the column to flood con­
tinuously. Lowering the pot temperature about 20° by 
lowering the distillation pressure did not noticeably decrease 
the decomposition or the flooding. By rapidly distilling the 
tri-n-butylborane through an 18-in. glass-helix packed 
column, the amount of decomposition was reduced. How­
ever, the distillate was not considered to be sufficiently pure 
to warrant the measurement of its properties.
Physical properties.  Samples of triethylborane and tri-n- 
propylborane of 99.8 and 99.7 mole % purity, respectively, 
were used to obtain values for the following physical prop­
erties.
Freezing point.  The freezing points were determined by 
means of a solenoid-stirred freezing point apparatus charged 
with 10-ml. samples. The apparatus was loaded and sealed 
in a dry box inerted with helium; subsequent operations were 
conducted outside the box. The thermometric system con­
sisted of a 25-ohm platinum resistance thermometer, a re­
sistance bridge (Mueller type), and a highly sensitive gal­
vanometer. The freezing point and the freezing point at zero 
impurity were obtained by analysis of the freezing curves.2 0 ,2 1

determinations of the freezing point on a given sample dif­
fered by not more than 0.002°.
Boiling point.  The boiling points were determined in an 
ebulliometor2 2  equipped with a platinum resistance thermom­
eter. The measurements were made in a helium atmos­
phere with an estimated accuracy of ±0.1°.
Refractive index.  The refractive indices were measured 
with a Bausch and Lomb precision Abbe refractometer en­
closed in a dry box with a helium atmosphere. Measure­
ments were made at 20.0 ±  0.1° and 30.0 ±  0.1° and three 
wave lengths of light at each temperature. The spectral 
lines used were the sodium D  (5893A), the mercury Hg„ 
(5460.7A), and the mercury Hgh.v. (4358.3A). The estimated 
accuracy of the measurements was ±0.0001.
Density.  The densities were measured with a modified Lip- 
kin pycnometer. The modification consisted of fusing a 
standard taper male joint onto the ends of the pycnometer. 
These ends could then be capped with a female joint 
equipped with a small stopcock. Once the pycnometer was 
filled, :t could be closed off without disturbing the level of the 
sample in the arms. The pycnometer was loaded and sealed 
in a dry box inerted with helium. The densities were meas­
ured outside the box at 20.00° ±  0.05° and 30.00° ±  
0.05° with an estimated accuracy of ±0.0002 g. per ml.
Dielectric constant.  The dielectric constants were measured 
in a cell of 25-ml. capacity. After being filled in the dry box, 
the cell was sealed off and removed from the box for the 
capacity measurements. Measurements of the dielectric 
constant were made at 20.0° ±  0.1 0  and 30.0° ±  0.1° with 
a probable accuracy of ±0.2%. The dielectric constant ap­
paratus has been previously described.2 3  2 4
Thermodynamic properties. Heat of combustion.  Heats of 
combustion were determined for triethylborane and tri-n- 
propylborane in a Parr adiabatic calorimeter with an II- 
lium constant-volume bomb.2 1  Temperatures were meas­
ured with a mercury thermometer (calibrated by the Xatl. 
Bur. of Standards) which could be read to ±0.005°F. The 
bomb was calibrated using standard benzoic acid supplied by 
the Parr Instrument Co. Because of their volatility and sus­
ceptibility to oxidation, the samples of trialkylboranes were 
introduced into the bomb in small thin-walled glass bulbs. 
In the first few runs the glass bulbs were suspended on an 
iron ignition wire, and the bomb was charged with 30 atm. of 
oxygen. Combustion was initiated by passing current 
through the iron wire. The heat generated ruptured the bulb 
and ignited the sample. Complete combustion was not 
realized with this method. Apparently the trialkylborane 
would flow out of a crack in the bulb and burn. The oxides 
formed would then impede sample flow and combustion 
would not be completed.
Bet:er combustion was obtained by sealing the iron igni­
tion wire through the wall of the glass bulb so that it passed 
through the interior of the bulb. The section of ignition wire 
inside the bulb was filed thin in one spot to ensure a hot spot 
at this point. Even with this method combustion often was 
poor. In over fifty runs only three were considered good.
Completeness of combustion was determined by visual 
inspection of the interior of the bomb and by analyses of 
the combustion gases for carbon dioxide and of the residue 
for boron oxide and boric acid. In the good runs the com­
bustion of boron was 99 to 100% complete, and carbon was 
from 90 to 100% complete. Hydrogen combustion was as­
sumed to be 100% in all cases. Corrections were made for 
unbumed material on the assumption that it was exclusively

The structure of a by-product in the preparation of 2,3-diphenyltetrulone from 2.3.4-triphenylbutvric acid, has been 
shown to be I. Various compounds related to the ester are described.
Several years ago, in the preparation of 2,3-  
diphenyltetralone2 -3  for use in other studies, traces  
of a compound I melting at 211-212° were obtained  
in several reactions. In one reaction in which the  
tetralone was prepared by treating 2,3,4-triphenyl-  
butyryl chloride with anhydrous aluminum chlo­
ride, the yield o: I was 18 g., 12% based on the  
weight of acid used. Analyses for carbon and hy­
drogen agreed with the values calculated for the  
tetralone but the molecular weight was much too  
high. Only one form of the tetralone, that melting  
at 147-148°, has been reported although many  
people have reported making it and diastereoisomers  
should be possible.
A series of reactions was planned which would test  
the hypothesis that I was an isomeric tetralone.  
The 147° tetralone II was treated with phenyl-  
lithium to ghr e a new tertiary alcohol III. This alco­
hol was dehydrated to give the known 1,2,3-  
triphenyl-3,4-dihydronaphthalene4  IV which was  
then dehydrogenated to give the known 1,2,3-

had been reduced to a secondary alcohol by alumi­
num isopropoxide and this alcohol had been de­
hydrated and dehydrogenated to give 2,3-diphenyl-  
naphthalene.
These two series of reactions, applied to I, should  
have led to the same final products if I had been an  
isomeric tetralone. Aluminum isopropoxide was  
without effect on I. Phenyllithium reacted with  
I to give two products, neither of which could be  
dehydrated by heating with Lucas’  reagent or with  
potassium hydrogen sulfate. Since I was not an  
isomeric tetralone, the problem was temporarily  
dropped.
Interest in I was aroused again when it was  
shown5  6  that 2.3.4-triphenylbutvric acid could be  
eyclized by hydrogen fluoride to give a small  
amount of 2-phenyl-3-benzylindanone as well as  
the more common tetralone.
From the infrared spectrum of I, Dr. Gilbert  
Stork of Columbia University suggested to us that  
the carbonyl group might be presented as an ester.  
This proved to be the case. The ester resulted from  
the reaction of unconverted acid chloride with the  
enol form of the tetralone. The following chart  
shows the relationships of the compounds involved.
Hydrolysis of I led to the known acid VI and a  
neutral oil which could not be crystallized but whose  
infrared spectrum indicated that it was the known  
tetralone II. Reaction of I with phenyllithium gave  
the known ketone VIIIs and a compound VII whose  
properties indicate that it may be isomeric with the  
ketone VIII. Ketone VIII was synthesized by the  
reaction of phenylmagnesium bromide on either the  
87° or the 130° nitrile IX.2 '3  Mixed melting points  
showed no depression and the infrared spectra were  
the same. Under forcing conditions phenylmagne­
sium bromide also reacted with I to give VIII. The

ketone VIII reacted with lithium aluminum hy­

could be deh 3’drated to give the known hydro­
carbon XI. This, in turn, was reduced to the known  
hydrocarbon XII, and a mixed melting point of  
this hydrocarbon with an authentic sample pre­
pared from XIII7  showed no depression. The re­
action of lithium aluminum hydride on the ester  
I gave a new primary alcohol XIV which was iden­
tical with the alcohol prepared by the action of  
lithium aluminum hydride on the 157° acid VI.

Preparation of the ester I.  The ester I resulted in some of the 
reactions for the preparation2 '3  of 2,3-diphenyltetralone II.
2,3,4-Triphenylbutyric acid was converted to the acid chlo­
ride by phosphorus pentachloride. After the removal of phos­
phorus oxychloride, the acid chloride was treated with an­
hydrous aluminum chloride to form the tetralone. This tetra- 
lone is known8  to enolize readily, and this enol form reacted 
with the acid chloride to form the ester I. The ester was only 
slightly soluble in ether, ethanol, and ethyl acetate but could 
be recrystallized from chloroform or dioxane. It crystallized 
as cottony, white needles, melting at 211-212°. Heating 
with chloranil failed to dehydrogenate it and treatment with 
aluminum isopropoxide did not reduce it. It was reduced by 
refluxing with lithium aluminum hydric.e and it reacted 
readily with phenyllithium and slowly with phenylmagne- 
sium bromide.

(8) P. Bergmann and J. Szmuszkovic, .7, .4m. Chem. Soc.,  
68, 1662 (1946).The ester (1.5 g.) was heated with potassium hydroxide 
(1.3 g.) in diethylene glycol. The alkaline solution was ex­
tracted with ether. Evaporation of this ether solution did not 
yield any solid but the infrared spectrum of the oil was the 
same as that for the known tetralone. Small amounts of the 
tetralone are always difficult to crystallize, probably due to 
the tendency to enolize. The acid from the hydrolysis w'as 
isolated from the alkaline solution by acidifying and ex­
tracting with ether. The ether was evaporated and the acid 
crystallized from benzene-petroleum ether (b.p. 60-70°). 
It melted at 155-157° and a mixture of the hydrolysis prod­
uct with a known sample of the acid VI melted at 155-157°. 
The yield was 84%. The infrared spectrum of I showed ab­

bromide,.  About 0.03 mole of phenyllithium was added to an 
ether suspension of 3 g. of I. The ether boiled vigorously and 
I dissolved. After standing for 2 hr. the mixture was decom­
posed with ice water. Tlie ether layer was allowed to evapo­
rate slowly. Two products could be isolated from the deep 
magenta colored solution by careful crystallization. The 
less soluble material, the ketone VIII, separated first and 
could be recrystallized from chloroform-methanol or from 
ethyl acetate to give white crystals melting at 198-199°. 
The more soluble compound VII could be crystallized from 
benzene-petroleum ether (b.p. 60-70°) and melted at 125—  
126°.
The ester I (2 g., 0.0033 mole) was treated with excess 
phenylmagnesium bromide in toluene and heated on the 
steam bath for 18 hr. after the ether had boiled oil. The 
magnesium compounds were dissolved in ammonium chlo­
ride solution and the toluene layer was added to water and 
steam distilled to remove the toluene. An ether extract of the 
water layer gave 30% of VIII. None of the lower melting 
compound VII was isolated from this reaction. A mixed melt­
ing point of the ketone from the ester and the ketone made 
from IX showed no depression. Both VII and VIII gave 
identical infrared spectra with absorption at 6 ix characteris­
tic of a conjugated ketone.

Dilute hydrochloric acid was then added, the ether evapo­

197-198°. The yield was 56%. The infrared spectrum was 
the same as that for the ketone made from the ester. This 
compound was described earlier.6  It was made by adding 
benzylmagnesium chloride to l,2,3-triphenylpropen-2-one-l. 
The resulting ketone, melting at 178°, was isomerized to the

was filtered and crystallized from benzene-methanol. It 
melted at 180-180.5° and the mixed melting point with a

Reaction of /3-Broniostyrene and Dinitrogen  
Tetroxide. A Radical Displacement
Travis  E. S tevens  
Received February 15, 1060
Addition of free radical reagents to halogenated  
olefins has been known to lead to adducts that have  
lost a halogen atom.1  2  3  For instance, various alkyl  
radicals and 1,2-dichloroethylene interacted to  
produce l-chloro-2-alkylethylenes,5  and the dini­
trogen tetroxide-allyl iodide reaction yielded 3-  
nit ropropene.”
The addition of dinitrogen tetroxide to /3 -  
hromostyrene now has been found to give fi- 
nitrostyrene as the major product, apparently by  
a radical path as outlined.4  Slow addition of dini­
trogen tetroxide to an ether solution of the bromo-  
styrene produced the nitrostyrene (67%) and
X 02  +  C6 H5 —C H =C H B r >
[C6 H5 —C ’H—CHBrXO»] — > - C«H— CH=CHX02  +  Br.
even inverse addition of the styrene to the tetroxide  
in ether yielded /3-nitrostyrene (47%). Formation  
of the relatively stable intermediate radical which  
may reversibly eliminate the N 0 2  radical or which  
may eliminate a bromine atom to give the unre-  
active /3-nitrostyrene makes this a favorable case  
for the observation of such a radical displacement  
reaction.
The other products of this jS-bromostyrene re­
action undoubtedly were the saturated compounds  
derived from the addition of bromine and dinitro­
gen tetroxide to /3-bromostyrene. Only one of the  
possible adducts, a dibromonitrophenylethane,  
m.p. 73-74°, was isolated. The nitro group ab­
sorption at 1540 cm.-1 in the infrared spectrum  
of this adduct indicated it was l,l-dibromo-2-  
nitro-2-phenylethane; absorption at higher wave  
length would be expected for the isomeric 1,2-  
dibromo-l-nitro-2-phenylcthane.6

Addition of dinitroyen tetroxide to 0-bromostyrene.  A solu­
tion of 4.3 g. (23.5 mmoles) of jS-bromostyrene in 100 ml. of 
ether was stirred at 10° while 25 mmoles of dinitrogen te­
troxide1 5  was swept into the ether solution in a nitrogen stream 
over a 1-hr. period. The mixture was stirred for an additional 
hour at 15°. Water (1(X ) ml.) then was added, and the ether 
layer was separated and washed with water and 10% sodium 
bicarbonate solution. Evaporation of the ether left 4.72 g. of 
residue. The residue was dissolved in methylene chloride- 
pentane and chromatographed on a silica gel column as de­
scribed previously.4  The first fraction eluted, 1.60 g., con­
tained almost no d-nitrostvrene as evidenced by infrared 
spectra of the cuts. A 0.83-g. portion of this, probably 1,1- 
dibromo-2-nitro-2-phenvlethane, solidified, and was re-

The next fraction eluted was (¡-nitrostyrene, 2.36 g., 
(67%),  m.p. 56-57°; the mixed melting point with an authen­
tic sample of the same melting point was not depressed. The 
infrared spectrum was identical with that of an authentic 
specimen.
The last fractions eluted from the column, a total of 0.71 g. 
of oily material showing hydroxyl absorption in the infrared 
spectrum, were not characterized.
Addition of 0-bromostyrene to dinitrogen tetroxide.  A solu­
tion of 28 mmoles of dinitrogen tetroxide in 100 ml. of ether 
was stirred at 10° while 23.5 mmoles of /3-broir.ostyrene 
in 15 ml. of ether was added over 20 min. The re­
action mixture was stirred in a nitrogen atmosphere 
during this addition and for an additional hour at 15°. 
The reaction mixture then was worked up as described 
above. From 4.40 g. of crude residue was obtained 1.55 g. of 
material eluted prior to /3-nitrostyrene; a 0.73-g. portion of 
this solidified and melted at 74° after hexane recrystalliza­
tion. The /3-nitrostyrene fraction weighed 1.66 g. (47%), 
m.p. 56-57°, identified as described above.

The catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to pri­
mary amines is a reaction of considerable im­
portance in organic synthesis and has been the  
subject of many investigations because good yields  
of primary amines are frequently diificult to obtain.  
The difficulty apparently arises because the re-

duction proceeds stepwise through the aldimine,  
some of which condenses with primary amine al­
ready formed and ultimately leads to secondary  
amines.1 -2
Recent work in this laboratory has shown that  
hydrogenation of ethyl 5-cyano-2-oximinovalerate  
in acetic anhydride over a Raney nickel catalyst  
in the presence of a basic cocatalyst, followed by  
hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid, gives d l- 
lysine monohydrochloride in almost quantitative  
yield.3  It has been found now that hydrogenation  
in acetic anhydride in the presence of a Raney  
metal catalyst and a basic cocatalyst, a technique  
which appears never to have been applied to simple  
nitriles, is very effective for the reduction of a  
variety of nitriles to primary amines. In fact, this  
technique frequently may be the method of choice  
for carrying out this conversion in the laboratory  
because it gives very high yields simply and rapidly  
at moderate temperatures and low pressures.  
As an example of the very mild conditions which  
may be employed, with Raney nickel catalyst  
and sodium acetate cocatalvst hydrogenation of  
most nitriles is complete in 45-60 minutes at 50°  
and 50 p.s.i. hydrogen pressure. Lower tempera­
ture may be used but requires longer reduction  
time. Raney nickel-chromium appears to be as  
effective as Raney nickel, but Raney cobalt  
is somewhat, less effective. Sodium acetate is a  
very mild cocatalyst suitable for most purposes,  
but strong bases such as sodium hydroxide give  
more rapid reduction. Caution should be exer­
cised when strong bases are used, as very rapid  
reduction become vigorously exothermic. Catalyst.

Stange, J. Ory. Chetn.,  25, 1302 (I960). References to the 
previous use of the combination of Raney nickel and acetic 
anhydride arc given in this paper.life is affected strongly by the nature of the co-  
catalyst. With sodium acetate the activity of the  
Raney catalyst diminishes markedly with each use  
and is too low to be of practical value after three  
or four cycles, whereas with strong base recovered  
catalyst is as active as fresh and can be re-used  
repeatedly. With some nitriles such as benzo-  
nitrile no cocatalyst is necessary, but in general  
its presence gives better yields and purer products.  
Unsaturated nitriles are reduced to saturated  
primary amines by the new technique and, al­
though the point has not been studied, it is likely  
that any other easily reduced group would also be  
attacked.
The amine products may be isolated in several  
ways, dependent in part on the nature of the par­
ticular amine. In many cases the A-acetyl deriva­
tive of the amine crystallizes from the reduction  
medium when it is cooled, and the solid may be  
obtained in a high state of purity by filtration and  
drying. In other instances it is convenient to  
subject the entire reduction mixture to acidic or  
basic hydrolysis and to isolate the amine as the  
hydrochloride or as the free base. Where a particu­
lar derivative is desired, it may be obtained fre­
quently by treating the hydrolysis mixture with  
the appropriate derivatizing agent. Each of these  
methods has been used at least once to isolate the  
products reported in Table I, which lists the re­
sults obtained with six typical nitriles. The yield  
of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropylamine hydrochloride  
from acetone cyanohydrin is not regarded ¡is repre­
sentative because the extremely hygroscopic nature  
of the product made isolation difficult.

washed with two 20-nil. portions of absolute ethanol and 
two 20-ml. portions of acetic anhydride. Catalyst so treated 
lost activity rapidly if allowed to stand under acetic anhy­
dride.
Reduction of tridecanenitrile.  A  2-3 g. portion of Raney 
nickel treated as described above and 12.0 g. of anhydrous 
sodium acetate were added to a solution of 10.5 g. (0.10 
mole) of tridecanenitrile in 120 ml. of acetic anhydride. 
The resulting mixture was heated to 503  and shaken under 
hydrogen at an initial pressure of 50 p.s.i. After about 1  hr. 
Iwdrogen uptake was complete, and the catalyst was fil­
tered from the hot solution. When the filtrate was cooled 
in ice, a white solid precipitated. After recovery and drying, 
this amounted to 24.1 g. (100*~c) of A ’-acotyltridrcylaminr, 
m.p. 57-58°.

Reduction of benzonitrite.  A mixture of 2-3 g. of treated 
Raney nickel, 10.3 g. (0.10 mole) of benzonitrile, and 120 
ml. of acetic anhydride was shaken at 50° under an initial 
hydrogen pressure of 50 ps.i. When the reaction was com­
plete (1 hr.), the mixture was filtered hot and the filtrate 
was treated with 40 ml. of water. Then 180 ml. of coned, 
hydrochloric acid was added, and the mixture was heated 
under reflux for 16 hr. The resulting solution was cooled to 
25°, made strongly basic with 5.Y sodium hydroxide solu­
tion, and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The 
ether solution was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, 
filtered, and treated with gaseous hydrogen chloride until 
no further precipitate formed. After recovery and drying, 
there was obtained 13.0 g. (91 %) of benzylamine hydro­
chloride, m.p. 248-249° (lit.,5  m.p. 248°).
Reduction of acrylonitrile.  A mixture of 2-3 g. of treated 
Raney nickel, 5.3 g. (0.10 mole) of acrylonitrile, 12.0 g. of 
anhydrous sodium acetate, and 120 ml. of acetic anhydride 
was shaken at 25° under hydrogen at an initial pressure, of 
50 p.s.i. Hydrogen uptake was comple'e after 16 hr., and 
the catalyst was removed by filtration. The filtrate was 
treated with 40 ml. of water and the mixture was allowed 
to stand with occasional stirring for 3 hr. Then 180 ml. of 
coned, hydrochloric acid was added, and the mixture was 
heated under reflux for 16 hr. After cooling to 25° the solu­
tion was made strongly basic with o.Y  sodium hydroxide 
solution and was stirred for 2 hr. with 16.8 g. (0.12 mole) 
of benzoyl chloride. The solid which separated was recovered 
by filtration and dried. There was thus obtained 15.0 g. 
(92%) of A'-propylbenzamide, m.p. 84-85° (lit.,6  m.p.
84-85°).
Reduction of adiponilrile.  A mixture of 10.8 g. (0.10 mole) 
of adiponitrile, 2-3 g. of treated Raney nickel, 4.4 g. of solid 
sodium hydroxide, and 120 ml. of acetic anhydride was 
shaken with hydrogen under 59 p.s.i. pressure, and the 
temperature was raised cautiously to 50°. At this point a 
vigorously exothermic reaction set in, and, although the 
heater was cut off, the temperature rose rapidly to 75° and 
then dropped slowly. Hydrogen uptake was complete in 15 
min. The reaction mixture was filtered hot and the filtrate 
was cooled in ice to precipitate the product. After recovery 
and drying there was obtained 16.0 g. (80%) of .Y,.Y'- 
diaeetvlhexamcthvlenediamine, m.p. 125-126°. (lit.,7  1  2  3  4  m.p.

Selective Reactions of the Butadiene-  
Methoxybenzoquinone Adduct
George  I. Birnbaum 1
Received February 20, 1960
A recent publication by Barltrop and Burstall2  
prompts us to report our work with potential  
intermediates in a synthesis of tetracycline (I).  
We prepared 2-methoxy-4a,5,8,8a-tetrahydronaph-  
thoquinone (II) in 85% .yield. Further utilization  
of molecules of this type to elaborate rings A and  
B of tetracycline requires the introduction of the  
A%Y-dimethylamino group in the place of the  
starred carbonyl. Selective reactions of this car­
bonyl were expected to be feasible since the other  
carbonyl group is deactivated by being conjugated  
with a free pair of electrons on the oxygen of the  
methoxy group. We were indeed successful in  
certain selective reactions. Compound II can be  
reduced selectively by sodium borohydride to  
give in 44% yield the keto alcohol Ilia. Its p- 
toluenesulfonate (Illb) was prepared, but an  
attempt to prepare compound IYa by a displace­
ment of the p-toluenesulfonate group was not  
successful as no reaction took place upon refluxing  
Illb with diethylamine.
The monoxime of II, compound V, was also  
prepared in good yield. Catalytic hydrogenation  
of V with palladium-charcoal did not, however,  
yield the desired amine IVb.

reaction occurred as it did, in spite of the fact that  
over 400% molar excess of the halomethane was  
used. The l,5-dibromo-l,l,3,3,5,5-hexafluoropen-  
tane (II) was dehydrohalogenated to the uncon­
jugated pentadiene (IV) 1,1,3,3,5,5-hexafluoropent-  
adiene-1,4 and some pentene (III), the 5-bromo-
1,1,3,3,5,5-hexafluoropentene-l. These results sub­
stantiate the work of Hauptschein, et al.,3  on telo-  
mers of fluorinated olefins.
As a corollary of this w'ork the polymerizability  
of the diene was studied.4  While the diene did not  
homopolymerize, it formed copolymers with buta­
diene, styrene, and vinyl acetate. The diene is sub­
stituted with fluorine on the carbon atom alpha  
to the sites of unsaturation (CF2 =CH CF2 C H =  
CF2 ) and thus not possessed of allylic hydrogen  
atoms. Therefore, it should not show the retarding  
influence of free-radical poljunerization commonly  
associated with allylic compounds. This advantage  
was probably more than offset by the fact, that  
free-radical attack would be predicted to occur at  
carbon atom 2 and would doubtlessly be sterically  
inhibited.
Another reaction investigated was that of the  
peroxide-initiated addition of bromotrichlorometh­
ane to vinylidene fluoride. Although this reaction  
has not been reported previously, it would be ex­
pected to occur quite readily. The complication of  
the formation of appreciable amounts of the two-to-  
one adduct should be lessened because of the high  
chain transfer tendency of bromotrichloromethane.  
This proved to be the case; yields of the adduct
(V), l,l,l-trichloro-3-bromo-3,3-difluoropropane, in  
the neighborhood of 60% were obtained con­
sistently.
In attempting to dehydrohalogenate the halo-  
propane, with aqueous and ethanolic base, no  
products could be isolated. In one reaction with  
aqueous sodium hydroxide, the reaction mixture  
sparked, possibly due to the formation of an un­
stable halogen substituted acetylene derivative.  
Triethylamine proved to be a useful reagent for  
effecting the dehydrohalogenation, although even  
here the high reactivity of the initial reaction prod-

action, however, was of interest in two respects.

Some Reactions of Vinyl and Ally 1  Acetate  
with Haloalkanes

in attempting to prepare polymers containing  
oxygen, cither in pendant groups or in the polymer  
chain itself, several methods involving free radical  
additions were briefly investigated. The first at­
tempt was the reaction of perfluoroalkyl radicals  
with ethylene oxide and the other involved the  
addition of haloalkanes to vinyl and allvl esters  
followed by conversion to (he unsat m ated epox­
ides. Although both methods were fruitless, some  
new materials were prepared and characterized.
SEPTEM BER 19G0 NOTES 1663
The ability of ethylene oxide to enter into free  
radical polymerization processes with fluoroole-  
fins was demonstrated by Hauptschein and Lesser.1  
It was thought that the reaction of perfluoropropyl  
iodide and ethylene oxide under free radical condi­
tions might proceed to produce perfluoropropyl-  
/3-iodoethyl ether, and subsequent dehydroiodi-  
nation would give the corresponding vinyl ether.  
An exploratory reaction carried out at 200° gave a  
15% yield of a liquid subsequently identified as 1-  
iodo-1,1,2,2-b'trahydroperfluoropentane. A repeat  
of this experiment gave a yield of 27% of the same  
alkane. Dehvdrohalognation of the isolated product  
produced the corresponding olefin (CF 3CF2CF2- 
CH=CFL). The fate of the oxygen in the original  
synthesis was not determined. Elucidation of the  
mechanism for the formation of the alkane was not  
undertaken.
The addition of haloalkanes to the vinyl and allyl  
esters should proceed analogously to the additions  
with bromotrichloromethane carried out by Kha-  
raseh2  in which addition of the trichloromethyl  
group took place on the terminal methylene group.  
The additions were carried out and the products  
are listed below:

Yields in the region of 50% were obtained in three  
of the above reactions. In the case of (a) no prod­
uct was obtained in either a benzoyl peroxide  
initiated reaction at 80° in a rocking autoclave or  
in a sealed tube exposed to a cobalt6 0  source. I 1 1 the 
case of (b) a fair yield of crude product was ob­
tained, but on redistillation, the material tended to  
decompose and only a small portion of the purified  
material could be obtained. It is interesting to  
note that the decomposition, which occurred at  
100°. resulted in the formation of volatile products  
which could be condensed in a Dry Ice-acetone  
trap. The material formed had a pronounced alde-  
hydic odor and was extremely lachrymatory.  
Kharasch2  similarly reported the relative ease  
with which the bromotrichloromethane vinyl

Am. Chem. Soc.,  69, 1100 (1947).acetate adduct was converted to /3,/J-dichloro-  
aerolein by the action of aqueous acid.
The additions of both dibromodifluoromethane  
and 1,2-dibromo-2-chloro-l, 1,2-trifluoroethane to  
allyl acetate gave good yields of the desired adducts.  
Elementary analysis and the infrared spectra were  
consistent with the proposed structure. In the  
benzoyl peroxide initiated reaction product, it  
was obvious that there was an aromatic contami­
nant present which could not be removed by dis­
tillation. In order not to resort to purification by  
chemical means, analytical samples were obtained  
by irradiation of the materials in sealed glass vials  
until a specified dosage was obtained. This method  
was originally reported by Postelnek et a i3 '4  for 
the additions of bromotrichloromethane to various  
olefins. The allyl acetate adducts were separated  
by fractional distillation through the 1’odbielniak  
minical column. The spectra thus obtained were  
identical with the others, but no aromatic residues  
arising from the peroxide initiator were present.
Finally, the adduct of l,2-dibromo-2-chloro-l,l,-
2-trifluoroethane and allyl acetate was reduced with  
zinc dust to give the reported pentadiene, 1,1,2-  
trifluoropentadiene-1,4,’ indicating that 2,5-di-  
bromo-4-chloro-4,5,5-trifluoropentylacetate rather  
than 2,5-dibromo-5-chloro-4,4,o-trifluoropentyl ace­
tate.

The synthetic route used is outlined in the ac­

product was a complex mixture, and purification  
resulted in low yields of I. It was assumed that use  
of a limited amount of chromic oxide would result  
in oxidation of I at the less hindered hydroxyl to  
give II rather than the isomeric hydroxyketone  
although this point was never unequivocally

An Adduct of Hexachlorocyclopentadiene  
with Acenaphthylene
D. C. Morrison  
Received January 26, 1960
Hexachlorocyclopentadiene has been shown to  
be an extremely versatile reactant in the diene  
synthesis.1  During the course of a study7  involving  
Diels-Alder reactions of hexachlorocyclopentadiene,  
its addition to acenaphthene was tried. In view of  
the fact that naphthalene acts as a dienophile in  
this reaction,2  it was expected that acenaphthene  
also might function in this manner, either through  
the five-membered ring or the naphthalene part of  
the molecule.
The reaction was effected by prolonged heating  
of the reactants and gave a monoadduct together  
with considerable tar. The properties and analysis  
of the product were best explained by assuming it  
was an addition product of acenaphthylene, the  
latter having been formed by the dehydrogenat­
ing action of hexachlorocyclopentadiene (chlorin­
ation followed by dehydrochlorination).

Accordingly, the addition of hexachlorocyclo-  
pentadiene to acenaphthylene was attempted and  
it was found that these interact readily in the cold  
to form the same adduct as is formed from ace-  
naphthene but without tar production.
The adduct is a very stable suostance, m.p.
192.5-194°, and unlike the naphthalene adducts'1  2  
could not be cracked back to the components by  
pyrolysis under vacuum. Instead, it was distilled  
unchanged with slight decomposition at a low  
pressure.
The ultraviolet spectrum resembled that of a  
substituted acenaphthene, giving evidence that  
the five-membered ring only is attacked. The ab­
sorption peaks are given with e  values in parenthe­
ses: 225 (44,000), 268 (3710), 278 (6370), 288  
(8020), 300 ¡i (5710). The corresponding figures  
for acenaphthene are: 227 (87760), 268 (3650),  
279 (5780), 288 (6500), 300 M  (4150).
Structure I was thought to explain best the  
properties of the compound. The analytical values  
and the molecular weight are in agreement with  
this. The adduct undergoes nitration to give a  
mononitro derivative.Anal.  Calcd. for CnHsCk: Cl 50.12. Mol. \vt.: 425. Found

In an attempt to crack the compound, it was heated with 
a free flame in a small flask at a pressure of 1  mm. A very 
high boiling material slowly distilled leaving a black tar 
in the flask. The solid distillate was recrystallized from 
benzene-petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) and formed grains, 
m.p. 187-190°. When mixed with the purest sample of starts 
ing adduct, the melting point was 188-191
Nitration.  A solution of 2 g. of the adduct in 100 ml. of 
boiling glacial acetic acid was treated with 5 ml. of sulfuric 
acid. Then 4 ml. of coned, nitric acid was added cautiously, 
in portions. The orange solution was kept at 100-115° for 
20-25 min. It was then cooled to about 80° and 10 ml. of 
water added, with stirring and cooling. The product sepa­
rated as a yellow crystalline powder which was filtered, 
washed, and dried; yield 2.1 g. (95%). The nitro compound 
was recrystallized from acetone-water and from benzene- 
petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°). On heating it sintered at 
195-200° with melting point at 230.5-233°.

Johns block.
Addition to acenaphthylene.  A mixture of 5 g. (0.033 mole) 
of acenaphthylene and 10 ml. (0.063 mole) of hoxachloro- 
cyclopentadiene was warmed for solution and then left to 
stand at room temperature. Deposition of crystals began in 
a few hours and. after 2 days, the paste of product was 
worked up. It was stirred with a mixture of equal volumes 
of ether and peteroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°) (35 ml.) and 
filtered. The material was washed three times with this 
solvent mixture and dried; yield 11.45 g. (best obtained), 
81.8%. Without recrystallization, this melted at 190.5-193° 
and, A vhen mixed with the purified material from acenaph­
thene, it molted 191.5-193.5°.
Addition to acenaphthene.  A  solution of 25.4 g. (0.165 
mole) of acenaphthene in 80 ml. (0.5 mole) of hexachloro- 
oyclopentadiene was heated by a bath of boiling pinene 
(  155-156°) for 130 hr. During this time, the mixture dark­
ened and slow evolution of hydrogen chloride occurred. 
After cooling, the contents formed a nearly solid black 
mass. This was w'armed, mixed with a little benzene to 
promote fluidity, and then stirred with a mixture of equal 
volumes of ether and petroleum ether (b.p. 30-60°). Crys­
talline grains soon formed and the suspension was left over­
night. The product was filtered and w'ashed with the same 
solvent mixture. Concentration of the filtrates and washings 
afforded a little more product. Yield of crude dark material 
was 49.1 g., 70%.
The compound was recrystallized a number of times 
from benzene-hexane and from ether with use of Norit. A  
pure white product was finally obtained, m.p. 192.5-194°. 
It forms characteristic sandy grains from these solvents.Reaction of Isopropylzinc Iodide with Terebic  
Acid Chloride. A Suggested New Mode of  
Action of the Blaise Reagent
Takeshi  Matsumoto  and Akira  Suzuki  
Received February 8, 1960
Iii the course of a study on the synthesis of a  
certain terpenoid compound, the authors became  
interested in the reaction of isopropylzinc iodide  
with 'erebic acid chloride. The reaction has been  
investigated by M. Matsui, et al.,1  who by the re­
action obtained pyrocin2  (I), in 5% yield based on  
the acid chloride. They interpreted their unusual  
result by scheme A.
It is well known that a number of branched-  
chain Grignard reagents reduce carbonyl com­
pounds to carbinols.3  However, similar reduction  
by alkvlzinc iodide seems never to have been de­
scribed before the appearance of the above-cited  
work.4  *  The present study was undertaken to ex-

amine the property of the Blaise reagent as a re­
ducing agent. This paper reports that the reagent  
possesses a fairly good reducing ability and that the  
above reaction does not proceed through a ketone
(II).
In the original method,1  the reaction was effected  
by condensing 0.2b mole of terebic acid chloride  
with the Blaise reagent prepared from 0.32 mole of  
isopropyl iodide. If the reaction follows the above  
presented scheme, at least two moles of the Blaise  
reagent should be used for one mole of the acid  
chloride. Simply by employing the molar ratio of  
2:1 and by lengthening the reaction period as com­
pared with the original method, a 49% yield of  
product I was easily obtained by distillation of the  
reaction mixture. In this case, as a by-product, a  
compound, m.p. 42.5-43.5°, was isolated from the  
higher boiling fraction by the countercurrent dis­
tribution method in 10% yield. The by-product pos­
sessed a molecular formula CiohBeO, and exhibited  
infrared absorption bands at 1770 (y-lactone) and  
1720 cm.-1 (C = 0) and hence was formulated as  
isopropyl terebate. The validity of this conclusion  
was confirmed by comparison with an authentic  
sample. The ester seems to be formed as a result of  
air oxidation of the Blaise reagent. Thus a better  
yield of pyrocin may be obtained through complete  
exclusion of oxygen during the reaction. The  
presence of propylene in the gas evolved during  
the reaction was suggested by the reduction of the  
volume of the gas on treatment with concentrated  
sulfuric acid. It is therefore very probable that pyro­
cin is not formed as a result of complex side re­
actions and that the reaction path actual^ exists as  
stated above in the scheme A. However, the inter­
mediate carbonyl compound (II) was not detected  
in the reaction mixture by dinitrophenylhydrazine,  
even when the starting materials were used in 1:1

preparation of the assumed ketone (II) was then  
attempted by the action of diisopropvlcadmium  
upon terebic acid chloride in ether. The infrared  
spectrum of the reaction product however, re­
vealed that an appreciable amount of isopropyl  
terebate was formed together with the desired  
ketone.*  6 3  5  The presence of the ketone and of the  
ester was respectively confirmed by the isolation  
of dinitrophenylhydrazone and of the ester itself.  
However, as the separation of the two compounds  
was not so eas}', the crude product was directly  
treated with isopropylzinc iodide. This treatment  
should afford pyrocin (I) and isopropyl terebate as  
a mixture, from which the two components may be  
separated by means of a combination of fractional  
distillation and countercurrent distribution. Con­
trary to expectation, the infrared spectrum of the  
reaction mixture, being almost identical with that  
of the starting material, strongly suggested that  
the material had been recovered unchanged. In  
fact the ketone (TI) was isolated as dinitrophenyl-  
hydrazone. In the infrared spectrum of the re­
action mixture no sign of the presence of pyrocin  
and its hypothetical precursor (III), which should  
exhibit an absorption band at 3300 cm.“ 1  region,  
was indicated. The absence of pyrocin was con­
firmed by nuclear magnetic resonance absorption.6  
In Fig. 1  is depicted the NMR spectrum of the  
reaction mixture in carbon tetrachloride solution,  
taken on a Varian 40 MC machine.7  The spectrum  
clearly demonstrates the absence of pyrocin8  which  
should show two resonance lines due to one vinyl
(5) Formation of the terebate may be clue to air oxidation 
of diisopropylcadmium. Susceptibility of dialkyleadmium 
to oxidation was recently noted: A. G. Davies and J. E. 
Packer, Chem. & Ind.,  1958, 1177. Ethyl terebate, which 
may be anticipated as a by-product [J. Cason and E. G. 
Reist, J. Org. Chem.,  23, 1668 (1958) and previous papers 
of this series by J. Cason] was not detected by infrared 
spectrum. The ethyl ester shows characteristic absorption 
bands at 1162, 1038, and 1018 cm.-1, while the mixture does 
not.
(6) Infrared spectrum alone does not provide a conclusive
evidence for the absence of pyrocin, since its characteristic
absorption band at 1665 cm.-1 is weak.

On the basis of the evidence presented above,

the reaction may proceed through the following

Well defined methyl proton peaks appear at 190, 204, and

tion).
(9) Comparison of the NMR spectra of the mixture with 
that of pure isopropyl terebate (Fig. 2) provides evidence 
for the ratio of the ketone (II) to the ester in the reaction 
mixture. As the line spacing between the septet due to 
a-proton of the isopropoxyl group is 7 cps., the peaks at 
230 and 237 cps. (Fig. 2) with identical spacing may be 
ascribed to /S-protons of the same isopropoxyl group. The 
remaining peaks at 219 and 233 cps. must then be due to 
the unequivalenc geminal methyl groups or. the lactone ring. 
Therefore, shifts at 237 (overlapped by meohyl resonance of 
isopropoxyl group) and 245 cps. in Fig. 1  may be assigned 
to dimethyl protons of the isopropyl group of the ketone 
(II). The ratio of the area under the peak at 245 cps. to that 
under the peak at 230 cps. may therefore be regarded to 
present the approximate ratio of the ketone (II) to the 
ester.Fig. 3. Distribution curve of a high boiling fraction from 
reaction of terebie acid chloride and isopropyl zinc iodide
The intermediate may be either the a-halo-  
alcoholate (IV) or the aldehyde (V). As the inter­
mediates IV and V are anticipated to be reactive  
enough to combine easily with a further mole of  
the Blaise reagent, the suggested mechanism B  
affords a more reasonable explanation for the  
absence of any carbonyl compound in the reaction  
mixture. However, further studies are necessary  
before the detailed mechanism of the above reaction  
of the Blaise reagent can be elucidated. As a  
reaction similar to the first step of the scheme B,  
the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes and to  
the corresponding primary alcohols by the Gri-  
gnard reagents may be mentioned.1 0
At an early stage of the present work, it was noted  
that treatment of terebie acid with thionyl chloride,  
which had been kept in the laboratory for over ten  
years, resulted in the formation of a compound  
C7H8 03, m.p. 44°, and did not afford any detectable  
amount of the desired acid chloride. Similar ob­
servation has been made by Barbier and Loquin,1 1  
who regarded the product as caronic acid anhydride.  
However, the product has now been identified as  
teraconic acid anhydride by the melting point of

the product as well as by melting and mixed melting  
point and infrared determination of the hydrolysis  
product, teraconic acid. As Barbier and Loquin’s  
product melted at 44°, it actually may have been  
teraconic anhydride. The anhydride may be formed  
through the action of impurities such as sulfur  
trioxide in deteriorated thionyl chloride on the  
acid chloride as follows, as treatment of the acid  
chloride with a small amount of sulfur trioxide gave

Terebic acid.  The method of preparation described in the 
literature 1 gave a mixture of unidentified acids. It was 
modified as follows. To 108 g. of sodium methoxide in 400 
ml. of anhydrous ether was added a mixture of 120 g. of 
acetone and 145 g. of meth.yl succinate under cooling with 
ice, and the resulting mixture was allowed to stand for 2 
days at room temperature. Coned, hydrochloric acid (700 
ml. rather than 350 ml.) and water (350 ml.) were poured into 
the mixture. After removal of ether, the residue was heated 
under reflux for 12 hr. Hot water (400 ml.) was added to 
the mixture, and the solution w  as decolorized with Norite 
and allowed to stand overnight. Terebic acid, which sepa­
rated, was collected and recrvstallized from water; yield 
65 g.
Teraconic anhydride.  A mixture of terebic acid (9 g.), 
thionyl chloride (15 ml., an old sample was used without 
purification) and dry benzene (40 ml.) was refluxed until no 
more hydrogen chloride gas evolved (for about 20 hr.). 
After removal of benzene and excess thionyl chloride, the 
residue was distilled in vacuo  and a fraction boiling at 137- 
145° (9 mm.) was collected; yield 4.6 g. On being put aside, 
the distillate soon solidified. After recrystallization from 
carbon disulfide, the solid product melted at 44°.

dride with water. The acid decomposed at 160-161° when 
rapidly heated and at 154-156° on slow heating, and no 
melting point depression was observed on admixture with 
authentic sample .1 3
Terebic acid chloride.  A mixture of thionyl chloride (30 
ml.) purified by Fieser’s procedure ,1 4 terebic acid (18 g.), 
and dry benzene (80 ml.) was heated under reflux until no 
more hydrogen chloride gas evolved (for about 9 hr.). 
The mixture was distilled and a fraction boiling at 123-129° 
(10 mm.) was collected; yield 17 g. 1785 c m r 1 (C=0).

345.Absence of absorption bands characteristic of the acid anhy­
dride group indicated that no detectable amount of tera­
conic anhydride was produced in this case. Newly pur­
chased, unpurified thionyl chloride gave an essentially 
same result. Addition of a small quantity of water or sulfur 
monochloride, a possible impurity of the commercial thionyl 
chloride, also did not alter the result.
The reaction of terebic acid chloride with sulfur trioxide  was 
examined as follows. A mixture of terebic acid chloride (1.1 
g.) and a small amount of sulfur trioxide in 4 ml. of benzene 
w'as heated under reflux for 13 hr. On removal of benzene, 
the residue was solidified, m.p. 41-43°. Recrystallization 
from carbon disulfide raised the melting point to 44°. No 
depression in melting point was observed on admixture with 
teraconic anhydride W 'hic.h was prepared above. When 
phosphorus trichloride w r as used instead sulfur trioxide, 
the acid chloride was recovered unchanged.
Reaction of isopropylzinc iodide with terebic acid chloride.  
Zinc-copper couple (60 g. weight, ratio 10:1), isopropyl 
iodide (50 g.), and 25 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 87-95°) were 
placed in a three necked flask equipped with an inlet tube 
for nitrogen, a reflux condenser, and a mercury sealed 
stirrer. A slow stream of nitrogen w ^as introduced and stirring 
and heating were continued for 10 hr. After cooling, dry 
benzene was added to the reaction mixture. A portion of 
the solution was submitted for analysis .1 6 A portion of 
isopropylzinc iodide solution (containing 0.04 mole of the 
reagent) was placed in a flask equipped with a condenser, 
a mercury sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel and an inlet 
tube for nitrogen gas. Terebic acid chloride (3.6 g.; 0.02 
mole) in 15 ml. of dry benzene was added with stirring and 
passing nitrogen, under cooling with ice. After the stirring 
had been continued for 2 hr., the reaction mixture was 
allowed to stand at room temperature for a W 'eek. The vis­
cous mixture was hydrolysed with 70 g. of ice and 30 ml. of 
6.V  hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was separated, and 
the aqueous layer was extracted with ether. The combined 
organic layers were washed successively with water, 5% 
sodium carbonate solution, and again with water and dried 
with anhydrous sodium sulfate. In this way, 3.1 g. of a 
neutral product was obtained. Distillation of the product 
gave 1.7 g. of crude pyrocin, b.p. 135-145° (35 mm.) and 
0.6 g. of an unknow-n product, b.p. 115-135° (6 mm.) The 
former fraction crystallized after being kept overnight at 
— 35°. Recrystallization from petroleum ether (b.p. 30- 
60°) gave pure di-pyrocin, m.p. 61-62° (lit .,1 m.p. 61-62°). 
The fraction, b.p. 115-135° (6 mm.) was fractionated by 
countercurrent distribution in the glass apparatus designed 
by Craig with the system w-hexane and 85% aqueous 
methanol as solvents. The distribution curve was plotted 
with weight of material in each tube as ordinates and the 
tube numbers as abscissas. Fig. 3 illustrates the result ob­
tained using this method on 0.47 g. of the above unknown 
substance. The material of the cut A became a scaly crystal­
line product. Recrystallization from n-hexane gave isopropyl 
terebate, m.p. 42.5-43.5°, r”“ 7 1 1770 cm .“1 (7-lactone)

determination of zinc in the solution by the pyrophosphate 
method (I. M. Kolthoff and E. B. Sandell, Textbook of

Reaction of diisopropylcadmium with terebic acid chloride.  
An ether solution (47.5 cc.) of isopropylmagnesium bromide 
(0.065 mole1 6 ) was cooled to 0°, and 10 g. (0.037 mole) of 
powdered anhydrous cadmium bromide was added in several 
portions during about 5 min. The solution was stirred under 
ice-cooling until a negative Gilman test for Grignard 
reagent was obtained (usually in about 30 rr.in.). A solution 
of 5.5 g. (0.031 mole) of terebic acid chloride in 20 ml. of 
benzene was added during about 5 min. After stirring has 
been continued for 4 hr. under ice-cooling and for 2 hr. at 
room temperature, the reaction vessel was kept air-tight 
and allowed to stand for a week. After addition of ice and
6.Y hydrochloric acid and extraction of the aqueous layer 
with ether, the total ether solution was successively washed 
once with water, twice with 5% sodium carbonate solu­
tion, and three times with sodium chloride solution; then 
it was dried. There remained 3.8 g. of a neutral product C;

(2 g.; 32%), which were identified with isopropyl terebate 
by mixed melting point determination. When the oily por­
tion of the distillate was allowed to stand for a long time 
(about 1  month) with Brady reagent in ethanol, a 2,4- 
dinitrophenylhvdrazone (1.2 g.; 10.6% based on terebic acid 
chloride) was obtained. A sample for analysis was prepared 
by recrystallization from methanol; it formed orange needles,

Reaction of the ketone  (II) with Blaise reagent.  The above 
mixture C (900 mg.; prepared in another run) containing 
the ketone (II) and isopropyl terebate was dissolved in 2 
ml. of dry benzene. The solution was added with stirring 
under cooling with ice to 7.5 ml. of isopropvlzinc iodide- 
benzene solution which contained 0.002 mole of the reagent. 
After the stirring was continued for 2 hr., the reaction mix­
ture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 8 days. 
The reaction mixture was hydrolyzed with ice and 6.V sul­
furic acid; the separated organic layer ar.d ether extracts 
were combined and washed successively with water, 5% 
sodium bicarbonate, and saturated sodium chloride aqueous 
solution. After having been dried with anhydrous sodium 
sulfate, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. 
A pale orange-red oily residue (750 mg.) was obtained. 
The residue was negative to Baeyer reagent to which pyrocin 
is positive. On treatment with Brady’s Reagent, the residue 
afforded dinitrophenyl hydrazone of the ketone (II). The 
XMR spectrum of the residue was reproduced in Fig. 1.

The Preparation of Acetylated Aldonic Acids
Robert  Barker  
Received March 7, 1960
The fully acetylated aldonic acids are important  
as intermediates in the synthesis of ketones1  and
(1) M. L. Wolfrom, D. I. Weishlat, E. F. Evans, and J.
B. Miller, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 79,  6454 (1957) and previous
communications in the series.some aldoses.2  However, attempts to acetylate the  
aldonic acids or their salts have demonstrated that  
the yield of the desired product not only depends  
upon the stereochemistry of the acid but, with any  
given acid, varies markedly with the particular  
salt employed.3  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
The most generally applicable method for the  
preparation of acetylated aldonic acids involves  
formation of the amide, followed by acetylation,  
and then regeneration of the free acid from the  
amide,4  although in some instances the use of this  
procedure has proved difficult.6
This report describes a method for the prepa­
ration of acetylated aldonic acids in good yields  
from the salts of the acids. The yields obtained are  
virtually independent of the salt used.
EXPERIMENTAL
A solution prepared at room temperature of 1.75 g. (12.9 
mmoles) of fused zinc chloride in 25 ml. of acetic anhydride 
was cooled to — 5° and 5 g. (24.3 mmoles) of finely divided 
potassium arabinonate was added. The suspension was then 
saturated with dry hydrogen chloride, care being taken to 
maintain a reaction temperature of less than 5°. When satu­
rated, the mixture was set at room temperature and pro­
tected from atmospheric moisture by a calcium chloride 
tube. After standing at room temperature for periods vary­
ing from 5 to 18 hr. the reaction mixture was chilled in an ice 
bath and small portions of chipped ice were added cautiously 
to destroy the excess acetic anhydride. To ensure complete 
destruction of the anhydride, the reaction mixture was left 
at 0° for 1  hr., then diluted to approximately 100 ml. with 
water, and extracted six to eight times with 30-ml. portions 
of chloroform or dichloromethane. The extracts were dried 
over sodium sulfate, filtered from the drying agent, and con­
centrated in vacuo  at 40° to a yellow sirup. This sirup was 
twice concentrated in vacuo  with 40-ml. portions of toluene, 
then dissolved in 25 ml. of warm toluene, and the solution 
cooled. Crystallization occurred spontaneously within a few 
hours. The yield varied from 6.0 to 6.8 g. (74-84%) and the 
material melted at 135-136°, with [a+D 5  +32.0° (c 4.0, 
chloroform).
The yields of acetylated aldonic acids and their physical 
constants are listed in Table I. All of the acetates were pre­
pared in a similar fashion to that described above except 
that the ammonium salts were allowed to react for a longer 
time because of their slower solubilization in the reaction 
mixture.

Received February 15, I960
The compounds AL(/3-picolyl)glycine, N-(f3- pi- 
roly l)-/+aminopropionie acid, and corresponding  
methyl derivatives were synthesized for compari­
son with the metabolic products of nicotine found  
in the urine of dogs after administration of nicotine.  
Since no reference to these compounds could be  
found in the literature, their synthesis is reported  
here.
EXPERIMENTAL
N-(.0-Picolyl)glycine.  Glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride 
(14 g., 0.1 mole) was dissolved in the minimum quantity of 
water and treated with 8.4 g. (0.1 mole) of sodium bicar­
bonate. Alcohol was added and the precipitated sodium 
chloride was removed by filtration, collecting the filtrate 
in a hydrogenation bottle. Pyridine-/3-oarboxaldehyde (10 
g., 0.1 mole) was added and the mixture was hydrogenated, 
employing 100 mg. of palladium catalyst.1  After the hydro­
genation was completed the catalyst was filtered, and most 
of the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The residual 
ester was washed with water, dissolved in acetone, and the 
insoluble material was removed by filtration. The acetone 
was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was dissolved 
in chloroform. After filtering and again removing the solvent, 
A'-(/5-picolyI (glycine ethyl ester remained as a viscous yellow 
oil. The yield of crude product was 50-60%. Attempts to 
distill the ester resulted in decomposition.
Several batches of the ester were combined in a flask, 
acidified with 15% sulfuric acid, and refluxed for 48 hr. 
The hydrolvzate was decolorized by boiling with activated 
charcoal and filtering. Sulfuric acid was removed by making 
the solution alkaline with barium hydroxide and filtering, 
and the excess barium hydroxide was removed by treating 
the solution with carbon dioxide, boiling, and filtering. 
Residual traces of barium were removed by treating the 
solution with a very small amount of cadmium sulfate, and 
precipitating the excess cadmium with hydrogen sulfide. 
The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum, the acid residue 
was dissolved in a minimum amount of water, and the A r-

placed in a pressure bottle wth 70-75 g. Raney nickel 
catalyst and reduced with hydrogen at a gage pressure of

catalyst was removed by filtration, and the solution evapo­
rated to near dryness under vacuum. The residue was

an Erlenmeyer flask and 25 g. (0.47 mole) of acrylonitrile 
was added dropwise over a period of 2 hr. The mixture was 
allowed to come to room temperature and left standing for 
several days with occasional shaking. Fractional distillation 
of the mixture under 5 mm. pressure gave three fractions:
(1) 95-96° (unchanged amine), (2) 165-170°, (3) above 
170°. Fraction 2, which represented a yield of about 30%, 
was refluxed about 20 hr. with 15% sulfuric acid. The sul­
furic acid was removed by treating with excess barium 
hydroxide and filtering. The filtrate was evaporated to a 
small volume and extracted three times with chloroform, 
thus removing a small amount of picolylamine. The aqueous 
solution was treated with carbon dioxide, boiled, and fil­
tered to remove barium. The filtrate was evaporated to a 
small volume. After standing several weeks in a vacuum 
desiccator, the liquid solidified to a waxy mass. The mate­
rial was dissolved in absolute alcohol and precipitated with 
acetone. The yield of a product, which still contained a

Our attempts to prepare 2,4-dioxohexahydro-
1,3,5-triazine (I) by previously described methods2 -3  
were unsatisfactory because of low yield and purity  
of product. A far more convenient method was de­
vised whereby crude, dry methylenediurea (V)  
was cyclized in a stirred, refluxing diluent such as  
nitrobenzene, n-hexyl ether, or the dibutyl ether of  
diethylene glycol (dibutyl Carbitol). Nitroben­
zene seemed most convenient to use. The methyl­
enediurea was prepared by a simplification of the  
method described by Kadowaki.4  The method of  
Krassig and Egar5  was used to prepare 6-phenyl-
2,4-dioxohexahydro-l ,3,5-triazine (II).
It was found that the efficiency of the halogéna­
tion in an aqueous medium was dependent on the  
pH and on the temperature at which the halogéna­
tion was carried out. Chlorination of I and II, to  
the novel III and IV respectively, gave the best  
results when the reactions were carried out in the  
range pH 1-3 and at ice temperatures. Chlorina­
tion at higher pH ranges and/or at higher tempera­
tures resulted in diminished yields of product.

Tetramin [d-(l-aziridinyl)-a-vmylet Hanoi] (I)  
is a broad spectrum anticancer agent which is  
active against a variety of transplanted animal  
tumors2  as well as several human carcinomas.2 ’3

/3-( 1  - aziridinyl) - a - methyl - a - vinylethanol (II)  
showed reduced activity against Ehrlich Ascites-  
Carcinoma, Sarcoma 37, and Walker-Carcino­
sarcoma 256, as compared with Tetramin (I).
These results lead us to report our findings on  
the synthesis and activity of the Tetramin ana­
logs (II-IV). These compounds were tested on  
the mouse tumors Sarcoma 180, Adenocarcinoma  
755, and Leukemia L-1210. Tetramin has a  
substantial anticancer effect in all three of these  
systems.3  However the three analogs (II-IV)  
were inactive at the maximum tolerated doses which  
were lower than the range where Tetramin showed  
activity. It is interesting to speculate that the  
possibility of biological oxidation of the secondary  
hydroxyl of Tetramin supplies the normal cell  
with a mechanism of detoxification which is  
apparently lacking in the cancer cell, thus ac­
counting for the higher toxicity and resultant lack  
of activity of II-IV. Allylic alcohols are reported  
to be more easily oxidized to the carbonyl than  
the corresponding saturated alcohols,6  thus of­
fering a possible explanation for failure of the  
normal cell to detoxify the saturated analog (III)  
of Tetramin or the isomer (IV) by oxidation.  
The lowered activity of II compared with Tetra­
min observed by Frohberg4  and the absence of  
selective activity of II observed in our laboratories  
is also understandable on the basis of an oxidative  
detoxification of Tetramin by the normal cell.
The synthesis of d-(l-aziridmyl)-a-methyl-a-  
vinylethanol (II) was accomplished in 70% yield  
by the addition of ethylenimine to 3,4-epoxv-
3-methyl-l-butene. Although there is a possibility  
of obtaining two isomers from this addition, no  
isomeric /3 - (1-aziridiny 1 ) -d-methy 1 -/3 -vinylethanol
could be detected by vapor phase chromatography.

3,^-Epoxi/-3-meth>j!-l-butene.  To a vigorously stirred sus­
pension of 67.3 g. (0.99 mole) of isoprene in 250 ml. of water 
was added 176.1 g. (0.99 mole) of K-bromosuccinimide at a 
rate which kept the temperature between 18-25°. After the 
addition (about 0.5 hr.) was complete, the mixture was 
stirred at 18-25° for 2-3 hr. by which time all of the A ’- 
bromosuccinimide was in solution and the solution gave a 
negative test with potassium iodide paper.
The organic layer was extracted with three 90-ml. por­
tions of diethyl ether. The combined ether layers were 
dried over magnesium sulfate, then evaporated to dryness 
in vacuo  to yield 151 g. of the crude bromohydrin of isoprene.
The isoprene bromohydrin was added over 20-30 min. 
to 270 g. of 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide -which had been 
cooled to 10-15° in an ice bath. After the addition was com­
plete, the reaction was stirred at about 19° for 2 hr., then 
the organic phase was separated from the aqueous layer. 
The aqueous layer was washed with 50 ml. of ether. The 
ether layer and organic layer were combined, dried over 
magnesium sulfate, then distilled through a small Vigreux 
column to yield 33.7 g. (41%) of 3,4-epoxy-3-methyI-l-bu­

at room temperature for 24 hr. About 15 ml. of ice water was 
added and the resulting suspension extracted with cold 
chloroform. The chloroform phase was washed with cold 
0.2.V  hydrochloric acid, cold 5% aqueous sodium bicarbon­
ate and cold water till neutral, dried over sodium sulfate, 
and evaporated under reduced pressure to dryness. A 28.2-

tained with the tosylate of epiandrosterone.
3a-Hydroxy-19-nor-f>ct-androslan-17-one  (II) from  (I). 
The crude tosylate (I) was dissolved in 4.0 ml. of dimethyl- 
formamide containing 180 mg. of potassium acetate in 0.5 
ml. of water. The resulting solution was refluxed for 3 hr., 
allowed to stand overnight, and refluxed for an additional 
hour. Twenty milliliters of water was added to the pre­
cooled solution and the resulting suspension extracted with 
ether. The ether phase was washed with water, dried over 
sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness under reduced 
pressure. The resulting brown oil was extracted with petro­
leum ether (b.p. 30-00°) and the extract evaporated to dry 
ness. A light yellow oil resulted (14.2 mg.); X 5 1 " 5.75 
(cyclopentyl ketone), 6.05 (C=C), 8.05 y (acetate) and no 
hydroxyl present. The complex band at 8.05 y similar to that 
of androsterone acetate indicated the presence of an axial 
acetate (3a,5a ) . 8 The crude oil was dissolved in 4.0 ml. 
methanol containing 55 mg. of potassium carbonate dis­
solved in 1 . 0 ml. of water and the mixture refluxed for 2  
hr. Water was added to form a suspension which was ex­
tracted with about 1 0 0 ml. of ether, the ether phase was 
washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate, and evapo­
rated to dryness under reduced pressure. The colorless oil 
obtained (8.5 mg.) was chromatographed on a silica gel 
column and eluted with benzene and benzene-ethyl acetate 
mixtures. The 2.7-mg. sample of white amorphous ma­
terial which was eluted with benzene gave no significant 
ultraviolet absorption in the region of 220-360 my. X j),!)( 
5.75 (cyclopentyl ketone), 6m (isolated double bond), and no

spectra and on reactions carried out under similar conditions 
with epiandrosterone 9 and allopregnane-3a-o!,l],20-dione 7  1  
which yielded the corresponding A2 -elimination products, 
the compound is tentatively assigned the structure of A2 -19-

Research in this laboratory on C1 4 -substituted 
steroids1  has been extended to include methyl 
substituents. In view of the recent publications,2  
especially that by Slates and Wendler,2 g  on C1 6 - 
methyl steroids we wish to report here on our work 
in this area. This note describes the preparation of
16-methyl-A1 6 -stcroids which contain substituents 
in the C-ring, in particular, on 21-acetoxy-9a- 
fluoro -11 d-hydroxy-16-me thyl-4,16-pregnadiene-3,-
20- dione (VII).
Following the procedure of Wettstein3  21-ace- 
toxy-4,9(11),16-pregnatriene-3,20-dione4  (la) on 
reaction with excess diazomethane gave 21- 
acetoxy-16 a, 17 a- [3,1- ( 1-pyrazolino) ] - 4,9 ( 1 1  )  - preg- 
nadiene-3,20-dione (lia).5  A band attributable to 
—N =X —stretching6  was observed at 1565 cm.-1 
in this and all the other pyrazolino-steroids herein 
prepared. Thermal decomposition of lia readily 
afforded 21-acetoxy-1 6-methyl-4,9 ( 1 1  ), 16-pregna- 
triene-3,20-dione (Ilia).

bromohydrin IV. This was converted, without 
further purification, in refluxing methanolic potas­
sium acetate directly into 21-acetoxy-16a,17a- 
[3,1-( 1-pyrazolino) ]-9|3,1  l(3-epoxy-4-p regnane-3,20-

An attempt to treat the epoxide V with anhy­
drous hydrogen fluoride was unsuccessful as the 
pyrazoline ring was attacked by the reagent. Ac­
cordingly, thermal decomposition of V was ac­
complished first to give 21-acetoxy-9/3,l 1/3-epoxy- 
16-methyl-4,16-pregnadiene-3,20-dione (VI) as a

pregnadiene-3,20-dione (VII).
By the same procedure3  employed above, the 
pyrazoline derivatives (IXa) and (IXb) of 21 
acetoxy-4,16- pregnadiene - 3,11,20 - trione7  (Villa) 
and 1 1  /3 ,2  1 -dihydroxy-4,1 6-pregnadiene - 3,20 - di - 
one7  (Vlllb) were formed. The former was con­
verted to 21-acetoxy-16-methyl-4,16-pregnadiene-
3,11,20-trione (X) by pyrolysis. In a similar se­
quence (Ib-*TIb->IIIb) 16-methyl-4,9(ll),16-preg- 
natriene-3,20-dione(IIIb) was obtained from 4,9-
(11), 16-pregnatriene-3,20-dione8  (lb).
EXPERIMENTAL
All melting points are uncorrected. The optical rotations 
are for chloroform solutions and were determined at 25°. 
The ultraviolet spectra were determined in ethanol unless 
otherwise noted; the infrared spectra were determined in a 
potassium bromide disk. The petroleum ether used boiled 
at 60-70° (Skellysolve B).
21-Acetozy-16a,17a-[3,l-(l-pyrazolino)]-4,y(ll)-pregna-  
diene-3,20-dione  (Ha). Forty grams of a 50% potassium 
hydroxide solution and 40 ml. of ether were cooled in a 
separatory funnel at 5°. To this 1.84 g. of .V-methyl-AT - 
nitroso-X'-nitroguanidine was added portionwise with gentle 
agitation until solution was complete, and then the mixture 
was allowed to remain for an additional 15 min. The two 
layers were separated, and the ether layer was dried over 
sodium hydroxide pellets for 0.5 hr. and carefully decanted 
into a dry flask. A solution of 184 mg. of 21-acetoxy-4,9(ll),-
16-pregnatriene-3,20 dione (la) in 20 ml. of methylene 
chloride was added to the ether solution and the mixture 
was allowed to remain at room temperature for 4 days 
(loosely stoppered flask). On spontaneous evaporation a 
mixture of solid and gum remained. One crystallization from 
acetone-petroleum ether gave 191 mg. of yellow' crystals 
(Ha), m.p. 158-159° dec.
A sample was dissolved in methylene chloride and filtered 
through magnesium silicate and evaporated to give white

in pyridine proceeded normally to give a crystal­
line monoacetate. This product conceivably could 
be either 4-0-acetyl-3,5-di-0-benzoyl-aZ(Mi/do-2-de- 
oxy-D-ribose or the isomeric l-0-acetyl-3,5-di-
O-benzoyl-2-deoxy-D-ribose. Since the substance 
shows no mutarotation in USP chloroform, which 
contains ethanol, it has been assigned the latter 
structure.
EXPERIMENTAL
Methyl 8,5-di-0-benzoyl-2-deoxy-a,P-v-ribofuranosides.  
Three grams of 2-deoxy-D-ribose1  in 60 ml. of absolute 
methanol was treated with 4.5 ml. of 0.1 4N hydrogen 
chloride in methanol and the resulting glycosidation was 
followed polarimetrically.2  After 15 min., when a maximum 
positive specific rotation of +39.6° based on starting sugar 
had been reached, the solution was passed through a column 
containing 10 ml. of Duolite A-4 resin (wet with methanol) 
onto 2 ml. of pyridine. The solution was concentrated to 
dryness at reduced pressure and the resulting sirup was 
dried in high vacuum over phosphorus pentoxide. The 
dried sirup was dissolved in 33 ml. of dry pyridine and 
treated at 0° with 10.5 ml. of benzoyl chloride. After 1  day at 
room temperature, several drops of water were added and 
the solution was concentrated to a thin sirup in a stream of 
dry air. The residue was taken up in chloroform and washed 
successively with cold 3% sulfuric acid, water, saturated 
sodium bicarbonate solution, and water. After drying over 
sodium sulfate, the solution was concentrated at reduced 
pressure to a sirup (8.4 g.).

and 2 0% pyranosides.
Crude 3,5-di-0-benzoyl-2-deoxy-n-ribose,  (I). The sirupy 
product described above (8.4 g.) was dissolved in 200 ml. of 
acetone, and 60 ml. of water followed by 45 ml. of 6N 
hydrochloric acid was added. After 2 days at room tem­
perature, when the mutarotation had become essentially 
constant, the solution was deionized over Duolite A-4 (wet 
with 75% acetone) and concentrated at reduced pressure to 
a sirup. This was dissolved in chloroform, dried over sodium 
sulfate, and again concentrated to a sirup (7.2 g.). The 
methoxyl content of the sirupy product was about 1.8%, 
presumably due to unhydrolyzed methyl pyranosides.
5-0-Benzoyl-n-glycero-4,5-dihydroxy-2-pentenal benzylphen-

ribose (7.2 g.) was diluted with a small volume of ethanol 
and 4.7 g. of 1-benzyl-l-phenylhydrazine was mixed in to 
give a homogeneous solution. After 1  day the mixture was 
extracted by trituration with petroleum ether (b.p. 33-58°) 
and the residue was diluted with ethanol followed by water 
to give 3.4 g. of crystals in two crops. After recrystalliza­
tion from benzene-ether, the 5-O-ben loyl-n-glyccro-A, 5-

0.5 g. of 10% palladium-on-carbon catalyst. The hydrogena­
tion was complete in 2 hr. with the absorption of approxi­
mately one molecular equivalent of hydrogen. Filtration and 
evaporation gave a crystalline residue. Recrystallization

Degradation of  IV to succinic acid.  An amount, of 570 mg. 
of III was shaken for 1  day with 1  ml. of benzaldehyde, 0.3 
g. of benzoic acid, and 15 ml. of water. The mixture was 
then extracted three times with ether and the remaining 
aqueous phase was further treated with 5.3 ml. of 0.471/ 
sodium metaperiodate solution for 7 hr. at room tempera­
ture. A few drops of ethylene glycol then were added, the 
solution was deionized, and the effluent and washings were 
treated with 1 g. of potassium permanganate. After 6 hr., 
excess permanganate was destroyed with acetaldehyde, 
manganese dioxide was removed by filtration and potassium 
ion by ion exchange, and the solution was concentrated to a 
semicrystalline residue. This was dissolved in dilute sodium 
hydroxide, extracted thoroughly with et.hvl acetate, de­
colorized with carbon, again freed of sodium ion by ion 
exchange, and concentrated. The resulting crude succinic 
acid (m.p. 178-180°) was converted to the p-bromobenzyl

The chemistry of the alkaloid evodiamine (I), 
derived from the Chinese drug plant E v o d ia  ru te -  
c a r p a  Benth. and Hook., was studied many years 
ago by Asahina and his co-workers. During the 
course of their investigations, a yellow base, 
C19H17N3O2, was derived upon pot assium permanga­
nate oxidation of the alkaloid . 1  2 The product was 
named hydroxyevodiamine and was assigned struc­
ture II. Later Ohta 2 observed that hydroxyevodi­
amine may react with acids with loss of water and 
suggested formula III for the salts. Upon addition

Its infrared spectrum in mineral oil mull, showing 
carbonyl bands at 5.97 and 6.05 u and NH bands at 
2.97 and 3.10 m, also eliminates the quaternary base 
structure (III. X = OH) as a possible one for the 
c r y s ta llin e  alkaloid, since the quaternary chloride 
(III. X = C 1) shows only a single carbonyl band at
5.87 /u . Hydroxyevodiamine thus should be formu­
lated as IV.

(4) We are indebted to Professor T. Ohta of the Tokyo 
College of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan, for providing an au­
thentic sample of evodiamine.S. M. Kupchan of the University of Wisconsin, 
had infrared and ultraviolet spectra identical with 
those of hydroxyevodiamine and gave no depres­
sion of melting point upon admixture. Rhetsinine 
is a more suitable name for the compound than 
hydroxyevodiamine.
Rhetsinine was also synthesized through reaction 
of l-oxo-l,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrid[3,4-b]indole (VI), 
methyl V-methylanthranilate (VII), and phospho­
rus oxychloride followed by addition of base. 
The hydrolysis to IV may be reversed by dilute 
hydrochloric acid, which immediately reconverts 
IV to III (X = C 1). Catalytic reduction of rhetsinine 
in acetic acid yielded di-evodiamine (rhetsine).

In connection with recent studies on fluoro 
heterocycles an interest developed in the synthesis 
of perfluorinated n-alkyl borates. Orthoboric acid 
esters are generally prepared by reaction of the 
respective alcohol with either a boron halide, boron 
trioxide, or orthoboric acid. Perfluorinated alcohols 
were desired in this work, but primary perfluo- 
rinated alcohols are not isolable. However, work was 
started with alcohols of the type RF CH2 OII which 
are commercially available. The orthoborates 
expected from these alcohols require final fiuorina- 
tion either by direct exchange of hydrogen for 
fluorine by silver difluoride or similar agents, or by 
halogénation with bromine or chlorine followed by 
replacement of bromine or chlorine by fluorine by 
means of an inorganic fluorinating agent such as 
silver fluoride.
Preliminary experiments showed that boron 
trifluoride etherate did not react with trifluoro- 
ethanol, pentafluoropropanol, and heptafluorobu- 
tanol even under reflux, whereas boron trichloride 
in pet roleum ether solution reacted instantaneously 
at — 20° to give the desired borates. Thus tris(tri- 
fluoroethyl) borate (I), tris (pentafluoropropyl)-
borate (11), and tris(heptafluorobutyl)borate (III) 
were obtained in a tiO-70% yield.
While bromination was unsuccessful, compound 
I was chlorinated rapidly when exposed to ultra­
violet light. Surprisingly, the absorption of chlorine 
never stopped and the volume of the reaction mix­
ture started to decrease after a certain interval of 
time. The reaction mixture thus obtained was dis­
tilled under vacuum to give two compounds, 
bis(trifluoromonochloroethyl) chloroboronate (VII) 
and the higher boiling tris(trifluoromonochloro- 
ethyl)borate (IV).
This result proved that the chlorination first 
proceeds as desired with the substitution of three 
of the six available hydrogen atoms by chlorine.
(l)(a) This article is based on work performed under 
Project 116-B of The Ohio State University Research Founda­
tion sponsored by The Olin Mathieson Chemical Corpora­
tion, New York, X. Y. (J)(b) Present address: Olin Mathie­
son Chemical Corporation, New Haven, Conn.The resulting compound IV then chlorinates 
further, not by exchange of residual hydrogen for 
chlorine, but by splitting off an alkoxv group with 
the formation of ATI.

We assume that compound VII is also not stable 
to chlorine and is probably converted into trifluoro- 
monochloroethyldichloroboronite (X) which in turn 
undergoes further reaction with chlorine to form 
boron trichloride.
Chlorination of II and III led to the correspond­
ing compounds V, VI, VIII, and IX. Bis(hepta- 
fluoromonochlorobutyl)chloroboronate (IX) was ob­
tained contaminated with heptafluoromonochloro- 
butyldiehloroboronite (XI).
For proof of structure, IX was also prepared 
from A T  and boron trichloride as another method 
of preparation of dialkvl chloroboronates.2  When

the preparation of XI, the monoalkoxy derivative, 
was attempted by using an excess of boron tri­
chloride, surprisingly only the dialkoxy derivative, 
IX, was obtained.
Since bromination and chlorination had failed 
to produce a perhalogenated orthoborate, an at­
tempt was made to prepare the desired perfluoro- 
alkyl orthoborates by direct fluorination of the 
hydrogen atoms attached to the a-carbon atoms of 
the alkyl groups by means of silver difluoride. The 
only product obtained from III was a boron-free 
material, probably di-l,l-dihydroheptafluorobutyl 
ether.

Tris[heplafluorobuiyl ) borate  (III). The solution of 23 g. of 
boron trichloride in 200 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30-38°) 
was added dropwise to a stirred mixture of 100 g. of 1,1- 
dihydroheptafluorobutanol and 100 ml. of petroleum ether 
with ice-salt cooling during 40 min. To ensure complete 
reaction, the mixture was then kept for 20 min. at 20°. The 
separated solid, boric acid, was filtered off and the petroleum 
ether evaporated. Distillation of the residual product gave 
a forerun of heptafluorobut.anol and then 66.5 g. of III 
(66%): b.p. 137° (200 mm.); n2 D 3  1.2596. The use of pyridine 
as hydrogen chloride scavenger decreased the yield.

The syntheses of organoboron compounds which 
we have carried out2-4 have been based on their 
possible utilization in the therapy of brain tumors 
by neutron capture irradiation. The study in 
(AH mice with subcutaneous brain tumors has 
shown5 '6  that organoboron compounds with hy­
drophilic groups offer the most promise for this 
type of treatment.
(O n  this basis it seemed desirable to prepare boron 
compounds with carboxylic acid functions. Many 
with the carboxyl group attached directly to the 
aromatic ring2 '5 '6  had been prepared and tested. 
Their utility prompted the synthesis of organoboron 
compounds containing an aliphatic carboxylic 
acid group.
Acylation and alkylation of a compound such as 
wi-aminobenzeneboronic acid would permit the 
introduction of such a group. However, the sta­
bility of the boronic acid moiety in simple aromatic 
compounds has been shown2 - 7 '“ 1 1  in a variety of 
systems to vary and to be dependent upon substit­
uents. It was considered possible, therefore, that 
acylation and alkylation of aminobenzeneboronic 
acids might occur with loss of the borono group, 
even though acylations of such amines have been 
effected1 1 '1 2  in certain instances without cleavage of 
the carbon-boron linkage.

The reaction of 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid with 
succinic anhydride was carried out in refluxing 
ethylene glycol dimethyl ether to form 3-borono- 
succinanilic acid (I). The product was character­
ized by deboronation with a silver salt1 3  to suc- 
cinanilic acid (II), identical in all respects with the 
compound which had been prepared from aniline 
and succinic anhydride. In a similar manner 3- 
amino-4-methylbenzeneboronic acid was con­
verted to 2-methyl-5-boronosuccina:iilic acid (III).
Maleic anhydride could replace succinic anhy­
dride in this acylation reaction. In this way 3- 
boronomaleanilic acid (IV) was synthesized. This 
compound was characterized by analysis and by its 
absorption of one mole of hydrogen under catalytic 
reduction with platinum oxide to form 3-borono- 
succinanilic acid. This was identical with the com­
pound which was synthesized using succinic anhy­
dride as the acylating agent.
The alkylation of 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid 
with chloroacetic acid occurred readily in an 
aqueous medium with sodium carbonate as a 
condensing agent. The product, 3-borono-V- 
phenylglycine (V), was very soluble and was iso­
lated as the hydrochloride. In a similar manner 2- 
carboxy-5-borono-V-phenylglycine (VI) was syn­
thesized from 2-amino-4-boronobenzoic acid. This 
compound was isolated as the free amino acid.
Screening of a variety of organoboron compounds 
resulted in attempts to prepare a-boronomalonic 
acid from ethoxymagnesium ethyd malonate. They 
were unsuccessful. However, it was possible to pre­
pare m-trifluoromethylbenzeneboronic acid from 
m-bromo-a, a, a-trifluoromethyl benzene v ia the 
Grignard reagent.

m-Boronosuccinanilic acid  (I). To a solution of 1.4 g. of m- 
aminobenzene-boronic acid1 4  in 15 ml. of ethylene glycol 
dimethyl ether (Ansul Ether 121), was added 1.2 g. of suc­
cinic anhydride in 20 ml. of this ether. The solution was re­
fluxed on a steam bath for 1  hr. and then concentrated to 
near dryness under reduced pressure. The solid residue was 
triturated with water, cooled and filtered. A 900-mg. sample 
of a brown solid was obtained, m.p. 185-189°. Successive 
recrystallizations from water, utilizing a decolorizing char­
coal gave a white crystalline solid, m.p. 196-197°.

In 1.5 ml. of an ammoniacal silver nitrate solution1 5  was 
added 100 nig. of m-boronosuccinanilic acid. The solution 
was warmed on a steam bath for 5 min. and allowed to re­
main at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was 
acidified with 30% nitric acid and filtered. A 45-mg. sample 
of succinanilic acid (II) was obtained, m.p. 148-150°, which 
showed no melting point depression on admixture of suc­
cinanilic acid prepared from aniline. The melting point of a 
mixture of boronosuecinanilic acid with succinic acid was 
174-178°, a lowering of the melting point of each by 15°.
2- Methyl-o-boronosuccinanilic acid  (III). A 3.0-g. sample 
of 3-amino-4-methylbenzeneboronic acid1 4  was dissolved in 
25 ml. of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. To this was added 
a solution of 2.2 g. of succinic anhydride in 40 ml. of the 
same solvent. The solution was refluxed on a steam bath for 
35 min. Solid had already begun separating out of solution 
after 25 min. The mixture was cooled and filtered, yielding
l. 6 g., m.p. 171-173°, of 2-methyl-5-boronosuecinanilic acid. 
The filtrate was refluxed an additional 35 min. After cooling, 
the solution was filtered and yielded a second amount, 1.9 
g., of the product, m.p. 160-167°. The combined yield of 
crude boronic acid was 3.5 g. After successive recrystalliza- 
tions from water a white crystalline product was obtained,
m. p. 182-183°, which was analyzed.

taining 4.9 g. of maleic anhydride. The solution was refluxed 
for 90 min. It was then concentrated to half its volume, 
cooled and filtered. A 4.5-g. sample of m-boronomaleanilic 
acid was obtained, m.p. 201-202°. From the filtrate a second 
crop of crystals were isolated, m.p. 201-202°. Successive

determined as paraffins are expressed in the table 
arbitrarily as the corresponding pure organo- 
aluminum compounds. While most of the products 
were identified by comparison with known in­
frared and mass spectra, no reference data were 
available for 2-ethyloctene-l. Carbon-hydrogen 
analysis and molecular weight measurements on 
this material indicated a composition of C 10H20.  
The skeletal structure was determined by identi­
fication of its hydrogenation product as 3-methyl- 
nonane. Absorption bands at 890 cm.-1 and 1650 
cm.-1, characteristic of vinylidene unsaturation, 
were observed in the infrared spectrum. For a 
molecule with the same skeletal structure as 3- 
methylnonane, vinylidene unsaturation is pos­
sible at only one position ;  therefore, 2-ethyloctene-l 
was identified unambiguously.

Received March 10, 1960
While attempting to measure the tritium isotope 
effects of the reactions between tritiated alcohols 
and organoaluminum compounds, the reaction 
between triethylaluminum and octene-1 was stud­
ied and the products identified. The products 
included 2-ethyloctene-l, a compound mentioned 
only briefly in the literature1  2 '2  and for which no 
reliable physical constants have been reported. 
Here we report briefly on the determination of the 
products of the reaction between triethylaluminum 
and octene-1, the measurement of some physical 
constants of 2-ethyloctene-l, and the determination 
of tritium kinetic isotope effects for methanol-O-f 
and isobutyl alcohol-O-f with the reaction mixture.

Other compounds, such as n-decene, n-decane, do-

The tritium isotope effects ( k u / k T),  at 25° for 
isobutyl alcohol-O-f and methanol-O-f, with the 
organoaluminum compounds in the mixture shown 
in Table I, were 2.5 and 3.2, respectively.
Tritium isotope effects with Grignard reagents 
have been reported for a) methanol-O-f as 1.0-

as 1.3,6  and d) ferf-butylcatechol-O-f as 3.0-3.5.6  
In the latter case, n-butyl ether was used as a 
solvent to prevent the formation of coordination 
compounds between the reactants, thus accounting 
for the greater isotope effect. The deuterium isotope 
effect between deuterium oxide and diethylzinc 
has been reported as 2.5.7  In light of the above 
reports, the values reported herein are plausible. 
The higher tritium isotope effect found for meth- 
anol-O-i compared with isobntyl alcohol-O-i may 
result from the solubility of the reaction mixture 
in excess isobutyl alcohol and its insolubility in 
excess methanol.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials.  The materials used far these experiments in­
cluded: Ethyl Corp. triethylaluminum '>95%), Phillips 
Pure grade octene-1 (>99%), argon, originally containing 
<20 ppm oxygen, <8 ppm water, dried further over Linde 
5A molecular sieve, methanol (>99.85%), and isobutyl alco­
hol (98%). The tritiated alcohols were prepared by exchange 
with tritium oxide, followed by removal of water by distil­
lation.
Reaction procedure and isotope effects.  Triethylaluminum 
was mixed with octene-1 in a weight ratio of 1:3.5, corre­
sponding to a ratio of 1.2 moles of octene-1 per ethyl group. 
The mixture was allowed to react under argon for 2 hr. at 
145-160°. Then the temperature was raised to 195° in 1  hr. 
The reaction mixture was cooled to 25° and dropped slowly 
into a greater than ten-fold excess of either methanol-O-i 
or isobutyl alcohol-O-f at the same temperature. Inorganic 
products and excess alcohol were removed by extraction with 
dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute sodium hydroxide solutions, 
and distilled water. The paraffins in a portion of the product 
mixture were separated from the olefins using the fluorescent 
indicator adsorption technique.8
The average molecular weights of the saturated products 
were determined cryoscopically. The radioactivities of the 
reagent alcohols and the saturated reaction products were 
measured with a Packard Instrument Company Tri-Carb 
liquid scintillation counter, using a phosphor which con­
sisted of 0.05 g./l. p-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene and 
3.0 g./l. 2,5-diphenyloxazole dissolved in a xylene mixture.9
The tritium kinetic isotope effects ( A ' h/ ' & t) ,  were calculated 
according to the equation:

where A, is the activity in counts per min. per mole for the 
alcohol, Ap  is the activity in counts per min. per g. for the 
saturated products, and M is the cryoscopic average mo­
lecular weight.
A control determination to test the technique was carried 
out by adding the labeled alcohols slowly to part of the tri­
ethylaluminum and octene-1 reaction mixture held at 25°. 
Complete reaction was allowed to occur between incremental 
additions of alcohol. Separation and measurements of radio­
activity and molecular weight were carried out as described 
above. An apparent isotope effect of unity for the control 
indicated that the reaction with alcohol was quantitative.
Analysis.  The products which were recovered after treat­
ing the reaction mixture with alcohol were identified and de­
termined quantitatively. Hexadecane and hexadecene were 
identified and determined directly by mass spectrometry; 
the distribution of C] 6  isomers was not determined. The other 
components were separated and measured quantitatively b}r  
gas chromatography at 80°, using a two-meter column 
packed with 20% o-xenyl-diphenyl phosphate on red Chre- 
mosorb. They were identified by infrared and mass spect i  a.
2-Ethyloctene-l.  Several milliliters of pure 2-ethyloctenr-1 
were isolated from the product mixture using a large ca­
pacity gas chromatograph with a 14-foot, one-inch diameter 
column packed with the same substrate mentioned above. 
The isolated material, of high purity as determined by mass 
spectrometric analysis, was used for determination of physi­
cal constants. These were: n2 D 5, 1.4231; da, 0.7438; b.p.,

Recently, Gillis1  has reported the isolation of 
small quantities of propionaldéhyde from the at­
tempted Bissinger rearrangement2  of trimethylene 
sulfite in the presence of triethylamine. For some 
time we have been investigating the base catalyzed 
rearrangement of 1,3-glycols (la-c) and the cor­
responding cyclic sulfites (Ila-c). In each case 
studied, it has been observed that treatment of the 
glycol with strong base, sodium or potassium hy­
droxide, in the presence of sodium sulfite, arsenite, 
or phosphite has resulted in rearrangement to form 
the monoalcohols (IIIa-c) in good yields (approxi­
mately 50%). The corresponding cyclic sulfites* 
on rearrangement with sodium or potassium hy­
droxide alone gave comparable yields of the same 
monoalcohols as shown in Fig. 1 .

The reaction is experimentally quite simple to 
carry out and offers promise for the synthesis of a 
variety of neopentyl-type alcohols, difficult to 
obtain by other techniques. To a slurry of water 
(1.0 mole), sodium hydroxide (3.0 moles) and 
sodium sulfite (1.0 mole), the glycol (1.0 mole) 
was slowly added at a reaction temperature of

130-140°. After the addition was complete, the 
mixture was slowly cooled, water added, and the 
monoalcohol isolated by extraction in the normal 
fashion. Alternately, the cyclic sulfite was treated 
in a similar fashion with the exception that the 
sulfite was omitted. The yields obtained by either 
procedure were between 46 and 49%.
Apparently, this is an extremely interesting 
example of a direct 1,3-hydride shift concurrent 
with the elimination of one of the hydroxyl groups. 
The resulting aldehyde, although not isolated 
among the reaction products, would be expected to 
undergo the Cannizzaro reaction in the strongly 
basic medium to yield the observed product, the 
monoalcohol. Basically, this mechanism is con­
sistent for the rearrangement of either the cyclic 
sulfite or the glycol and can be visualized as in­
dicated in Fig. 2. Using scale molecular models, 
the hydride migration postulated is easily visual­
ized. In the case of the glycol, however, it must 
be assumed that only the monosulfite is formed 
and that the steric compression of the substituents 
on the a lp h a -c a r b o n  facilitates the rearrangement.
Further examples of this novel and interesting 
rearrangement are presently under investigation 
and a full account of this study with supporting 
data concerning the postulated mechanism will 
be published soon.

simple esters and much work has gone into the 
investigation of possible synthetic methods.1  To 
date the compounds have not been available. We 
wish to report the synthesis of esters of both the 
acids by a simple modification of the Claisen ester 
condensation of ethyl oxalate with a - and y - 
pi coline.
For reasons which will be given later, it. appeared 
to 11s that previous attempts failed because of 
either too great or too little activity of the basic 
co-reactant used, and a metal derivative of the 
picolines of somewhat intermediate reactivity 
seemed to be indicated. If 2-picolyllithium is 
treated with anhydrous cadmium chloride and the 
resulting picolylcadium is treated at — 70° in 
ether with ethyl oxalate a 10% yield of easily 
purified ethyl 2-pyridylpyruvate is obtained as 
light-yellow crystals melting at 82.5-83.5° ( A n a l.  
Calcd. for CioHn03 N: C, 62.16; H, 5.74; N, 7.25.

Use of cadmium chloride was not effective in the 
case of 4-picoline but when mercuric chloride was 
substituted for it, under almost identical condi­
tions, a 10% yield of ethyl 4-picolylpyruvate was 
obtained. This ester was also easily isolated and 
purified and appeared as an orange-yellow powder 
which melted at 138-139°. ( A n a l.  Calcd. for C io-

When some representative perchloryl aromatic 
compounds, I and II, dissolved in glacial acetic 
acid, were stirred in contact with a palladium-on- 
charc.oal catalyst and with hydrogen,1  they ab­
sorbed the latter rapidly.2  The products were 
identified by ultraviolet spectral data as being the
(1) These hydrogenolyses were all run at room tempera­
ture and on a micro scale. The apparatus, technique, and 
catalyst used were as described by C. L. Ogg and F. J. 
Cooper, Anal. Chem.,  21, 1400 (1949).
(2) An earlier probing experiment failed to reveal appreci­
able reaction between hydrogen with palladium catalyst 
and perchlorylbenzene [C. E. Inman, R. E. Oesterling, and 
E. A. Tyczkowski, •/. Am. Chem. Soc.,  80, 5286 (1958)]. 
The present data now amend this erroneous impression. 
Other than the possibility that the earlier run may have 
contained some impurities which poise ned the catalyst, 
and the fact that it was not run on a quantitative scale, 
we cannot explain the negative result.C103

deperchlorylated compounds (III). The stoichiom­
etry of the reaction corresponds generally to
ArClOs +  4H> ----s- ArH +  HC1 +  3H2 0  (1)
There are two qualifications we must offer to the 
above statements. First, m -n itroperchlory]benzene 
absorbed not 4, but 7 moles of hydrogen corre­
sponding to reduction of the nitro-group as well as 
hydrogenolysis of the perchloryl moiety. Second, 
our qualitative series of runs revealed no apparent 
structural influence on rate of hydrogenolysis, the 
uptake of hydrogen being quite rapid ar.d essen­
tially complete in 30 minutes at room temperature. 
The only exception was m-aminoperchlorylbenzene 
which as the free base readily underwent reaction
(1) but which when placed in solution as its hydro­
chloride, was resistant to hydrogenolysis. The 
cause of this anomaly is being examined further.
When 95% ethanol was used as solvent the 
absorption of hydrogen observed was s:ep-wise, 
one mole being taken up very rapidly and the 
other three much more slowly. These data suggest 
the following sequence for the overall hydro­
genolysis (1).
ArClOs +  H - >  — s- ArH +  HCIO, (2)
HC103  +  3H» HC1 +  3H2 G (3)
Calibrating experiments with chloric acid solu­
tions in both glacial acetic acid (where reduction is 
rapid) and 95% ethanol (where reduction is slow) 
confirm this sequence of cleavage. I 11 a critical 
experiment, a solution of la in 95% ethanol was 
allowed to take up one molar proportion of hydro­
gen, it was then filtered, extracted with ether, 
and the aqueous mother liquor was shown to 
contain 88% of the calculated chlorate content in 
accord with equation (2). An alternative mode of 
scission to the observed initial C—Cl rupture would 
involve initial Cl—O cleavages (to yield Ar—Cl) 
followed by its hydrogenolysis. This Ar—Cl 
intermediate in the case of la, viz. chlorobenzene 
was not hydrogenolyzed under our conditions.
These results also have some implication with 
regard to the structure of compounds of type (I). 
If the perchloryl compounds had the structure 
Ar—O—C102  instead of the well established one, 
ArC103 ,3  then one might anticipate their hydro­
genolysis being akin to those of the analogous 
nitrate esters4  and they should then proceed as 
follows:

present data thus support our earlier structural 
conclusions.3 - 5
