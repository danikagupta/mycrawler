Abstract
In intensive aquaculture systems, ammonia –nitrogen buildup from the metabolism of feed is usually the second limiting factor to
increase production levels after dissolved oxygen. The three nitrogen conversion pathways traditionally used for the removal of
ammonia –nitrogen in aquaculture systems are photoautotrophic removal by algae, autotrophic bacterial conversion of ammonia –
nitrogen to nitrate –nitrogen, and heterotrophic bacterial conversion of ammonia –nitrogen directly to microbial biomass. Tra-
ditionally, pond aquaculture has used photoautotrophic algae based systems to control inorganic nitrogen buildup. Currently, the
primary strategy in intensive recirculating production systems for controlling ammonia –nitrogen is using large fixed-cell bioreactors.
This option utilizes chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria, Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) and Nitrite Oxidizing Bacteria (NOB),
for the nitrification of ammonia –nitrogen to nitrite –nitrogen and finally to nitrate –nitrogen. In the past several years, zero-exchange
management systems have been developed that are based on heterotrophic bacteria and have been promoted for the intensive
production of marine shrimp. In this third pathway, heterotrophic bacterial growth is stimulated through the addition of organic
carbonaceous substrate. At high carbon to nitrogen (C/N) feed ratios, heterotrophic bacteria will assimilate ammonia –nitrogen
directly into cellular protein. This paper reviews these three ammonia removal pathways, develops a set of stoichiometric balanced
relationships using half-reaction relationships, and discusses their impact on water quality. In addition, microbial growth
fundamentals are used to characterize production of volatile and total suspended solids for autotrophic and heterotrophic systems.

1. Introduction
Aquaculture can be defined as the cultivation of
aquatic products under controlled conditions, where the
major goal is to produce a saleable product as efficientlyand cost effectively as possible. This usually implies
that the system uses the highest stocking density
possible, highest quality feeds and active water quality
management. In these systems, high levels of ammonia –
nitrogen are excretion due to the high protein content of
the feed and high production densities, often exceeding
120 kg/m3. Since even low levels of ammonia can be
toxic to most cultured animals ( Timmons et al., 2002 ),

provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector the aquaculturalist needs to provide mechanisms to en-
hance the removal of ammonia to maintain an accept-able concentration. This also holds true for many otherwater quality parameters, particularly high concentra-tions of nitrite, carbon dioxide, and suspended solids ororganic loading. The organic carbon loading on thesystem is particularly important, because it relates to thebiochemical oxygen demand (BOD) on the system and
whether the water body will require supplemental aera-
tion as this BOD is exerted.
Aquaculture production systems are often classified
into three general types: extensive ponds, intensiveponds, and intensive recirculating tank and racewaysystems. In both extensive and intensive pond systems,ammonia production is controlled through oxidation tonitrate by a combination of autotrophic processes, driv-
en by nitrifying bacteria and photoautotrophic processes
that assimilate ammonia directly into algal biomass(Brune et al., 2004 ). For example, extensive pond ma-
rine shrimp production systems are often very large andwith low biomass loading, on the order of 0.5 kg/m
3.A s
a result of this low biomass, there is generally no activemanipulation of the water quality, other than to providesupplemental aeration during times of high oxygen
demand due to algae respiration in early morning hours.
Recently to improve economics, marine shrimp biomassloading in ponds has been intensified to as high as 2 to3 kg/m
3by providing active mixing of the water col-
umn, removal of accumulated sludge, use of high qual-ity formulated feeds, continuous supplemental aeration(McIntosh, 2001 ) and the development of the parti-
tioned production system ( Brune et al., 2004 ).
Intensive recirculating systems are operated at very
low water exchange rates (2% to 10% per day). Theinorganic ammonia –nitrogen buildup in these intensive
production systems has been traditionally controlled byusing large fixed-cell bioreactors that rely on the nitri-fication of ammonia –nitrogen to nitrate –nitrogen by
Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) and Nitrite Oxi-dizing Bacteria (NOB), autotrophic bacteria. The
growth of heterotrophic bacteria and the accumulation
of organic carbon are minimized through the rapid re-moval of solids from the system and by using some levelof water exchange ( Timmons et al., 2002 ).
Recently, a new production strategy has emerged
called intensive zero exchange systems. In these systems,the ammonia buildup is controlled by the manipulation ofthe carbon/nitrogen ratio in such a way as to promote the
growth of heterotrophic bacteria ( Avinimelech, 1999;
McIntosh, 1999, 2001 ). As a result, the ammonia –
nitrogen is removed from the system through assimilation
into microbial biomass. As a bonus, for some aquaculturespecies (marine shrimp and tilapia), this bacterial biomassproduced in the intensive zero-exchange systems can bean important source of feed protein, reducing the cost ofproduction and thus improving the overall economics(McIntosh, 1999; Moss, 2002 ).
In the last few years, research demonstrating low
water exchange marine shrimp production systems hasbeen conducted ( Ebeling and LaFranchi, 1990; Santos
and Ebeling, 1990 ), and zero-exchange management
systems have been developed for large-scale pond pro-duction of marine shrimp traditionally photoautotrophicalgae based ( Hopkins et al., 1996; Avnimelech et al.,
1994 ), and where organic labile carbonaceous substrate
is added to the systems to support microbial metabolism(Avinimelech, 1999; McIntosh, 1999 ). At high organic
carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios, bacteria will assimilate
nitrogen, i.e., ammonia, from the water and produce cell
protein. Several attempts have been made to develop thetechnology for indoor production systems at high den-sities ( Weirich et al., 2002; Otoshi et al., 2003; Davis
and Arnold, 1998; Van Wyk, 1999 ), although it should
be noted that in addition to algae and bacterial biomass,each of these incorporated some additional form offixed-film biofiltration.
In reviewing the literature on zero-exchange systems,
there appears to be a limited understanding as to the typeof ammonia removal system being employed and wheth-er it is photoautotrophic, autotrophic bacterial or hetero-trophic bacterial based, or in reality some mixture of thethree. In order to optimize water quality and effectivelymanage an aquaculture system, it is important to under-stand what type and the impact on water quality of am-
monia removal system. This paper reviews these three
ammonia removal pathways, develops a set of stoichio-metric balanced relationships using half-reaction rela-tionships, and discusses their impact on water quality. Inaddition, microbial growth fundamentals are used tocharacterize production of volatile and total suspendedsolids for autotrophic and heterotrophic systems.
2. Ammonia –nitrogen production
Ammonia is produced as a major end product of the
metabolism of protein catabolism and is excreted as un-
ionized ammonia across the gills of aquatic organisms.Ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate are all highly soluble inwater. In water, ammonia exists in two forms: un-ion-ized ammonia, NH
3, and ionized ammonium, NH 4+. The
relative concentration of each of these forms is primarilya function of pH, temperature, and salinity ( Anthonisen
et al., 1976 ). The sum of the two (NH
4++NH 3) is usually
referred to as total ammonia –nitrogen (TAN) or347 J.M. Ebeling et al. / Aquaculture 257 (2006) 346 –358simply ammonia. It is common in aquatic chemistry to
express inorganic nitrogen compounds in terms of thenitrogen they contain, i.e., NH
4+–N (ionized am-
monia –nitrogen), NH 3–N (un-ionized ammonia– nitro-
gen), NO 2−–N (nitrite –nitrogen), and NO 3−–N (nitrate –
nitrogen). This allows for easier computation of totalammonia– nitrogen (TAN=NH
4+–N+NH 3–N) and a
mass balances between the various stages of nitrification.
An estimate of ammonia– nitrogen generated per day
in an aquaculture production system can be calculatedbased upon the feeding rate ( Timmons et al., 2002 ):

TAN¼F*PC*0 :092 ð1Þ
where:
PTAN Production rate of total ammonia nitrogen,
(kg/day)
F Feed rate (kg/day)
PC Protein concentration in feed (decimal value)
The constant in the ammonia generation equation
assumes that protein is 16% nitrogen, 80% nitrogen isassimilated by the organism, 80% assimilated nitrogenis excreted, and 90% of nitrogen excreted as TAN+10%as urea. In addition, the nitrogen in feces and uneatenfeed is removed quickly by sedimentation or filtrationand the sludge removed from the system.
For heterotrophic bacterial based zero-exchange pro-
duction systems, this formula needs to be modified to
reflect that solids are not removed from the system and
there is no traditional fixed-film biofilter. Thus all ofthe nitrogen excreted, both TAN and urea is available tothe bacterial community. In addition for the exampleused in this paper, research data suggests that 90% ofthe nitrogen assimilated by marine shrimp is excretedas TAN and urea. Thus for marine shrimp:

What follows is a review of these three nitrogen
conversion pathways —photoautotrophic (algal based),
autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria and their implica-
tions on water quality parameters, most importantly
ammonia –nitrogen, nitrite –nitrogen, carbon dioxide,
and alkalinity.
3. Photoautotrophic (algal based systems)
3.1. Background —photoautotrophic systems
Conventional aquaculture ponds rely on the use of
algal biosynthesis for the removal of the majority of
inorganic nitrogen. The major disadvantage of algalbased systems are the wide diurnal variations in dis-solved oxygen, pH and ammonia –nitrogen and the long
term changes in algal density and frequent ‘die-offs ’
(Burford et al., 2003 ). Unmanaged algal populations in
conventional ponds typically can fix 2 –3 g carbon/m
2
day. High rate mixed ponds that are well managed canyield higher rates, 10 –12 g carbon/m
2day ( Brune et al.,
2003 ).
3.2. Stoichiometry —photoautotrophic systems
The biosynthesis of saltwater algae can be described
in general by the following stoichiometric relationships(Stumm and Morgan, 1996 ) for ammonia as the nitrogen
source:
16NH
þ
4þ92CO 2þ92H 2Oþ14HCO−3
þHPO2−
4→C106H263O110N16Pþ106O 2ð3Þ
Or, for nitrate as the nitrogen source:
16NO−
3þ124CO 2þ140H 2O
þHPO2−
4→C106H263O110N16Pþ138O 2ð4Þ
þ18HCO−3
where C 106H263O110N16P represents the stoichiometric
formula for seawater algae.
Note that 3.13 g of alkalinity (as CaCO 3) is con-
sumed for every g of ammonia –nitrogen consumed in
the first relationship and 4.02 g of alkalinity (as CaCO 3)
is produced for every g of nitrate –nitrogen consumed in
the second. Using these stoichiometric relationships, for
every g of ammonia –nitrogen converted to algal bio-
mass, 18.07 g of carbon dioxide is consumed and for
every g of nitrate –nitrogen used 24.4 g of carbon di-
oxide. Correspondingly, 15.14 and 19.71 g of O 2are
produced respectively per gram of ammonia –nitrogen
and per gram of nitrate –nitrogen. Finally, a significant
quantity of algal biomass, 15.85 g is generated per gram
of either ammonia or nitrate nitrogen. Table 1 sum-
marizes the stoichiometry, including the consumptionand production of inorganic and organic carbon.
4. Autotrophic bacteria —nitrification
4.1. Background —autotrophic bacteria
There are two phylogenetically distinct groups of
bacteria that collectively perform nitrification. These
two groups of bacteria are generally categorized as
chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria because they derivetheir energy from inorganic compounds as opposed toheterotrophic bacteria that derive energy from organic348 J.M. Ebeling et al. / Aquaculture 257 (2006) 346 –358compounds ( Hagopian and Riley, 1998 ). Ammonia
Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) obtain their energy by
catabolizing un-ionized ammonia to nitrite and includebacteria of the genera Nitrosomonas ,Nitrosococcus ,
Nitrosospira ,Nitrosolobus , and Nitrosovibrio . Nitrite
Oxidizing Bacteria (NOB) oxidize nitrite to nitrate, andinclude bacteria of the genera Nitrobacter ,Nitrococcus ,
Nitrospira ,a n dNitrospina . Nitrifying bacteria are
primarily obligate autotrophs, which consume carbondioxide as their primary carbon source, and obligateaerobes, which require oxygen to grow ( Hagopian and
Riley, 1998 ).
The major factors affecting the rate of nitrification in
suspended growth include: ammonia– nitrogen and ni-
trite–nitrogen concentration, carbon/nitrogen ratio, dis-
solved oxygen, pH, temperature and alkalinity. The impactof the carbon/nitrogen ratio will be discussed later in thepaper. The effects of dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature,and alkalinity are reviewed by Timmons et al. (2002) .
4.2. Stoichiometry —autotrophic bacteria
Classical thermodynamic principles can be applied to
biological reactions to describe how they utilize energythrough oxidation –reduction processes. The electron
equivalent approach is used to account for energy andelectron flow since most of the pertinent reactions areredox reactions. An “electron equivalent (eeq) ”of a
substance equals the amount of that substance that willdeliver 1mol of electrons for a specified reaction. Forexample:
1=3Fe¼1=3Fe
ð3þÞþe−
Therefore 1/3mol of Fe is 1eeq of iron.
Redox reactions consist of compounds losing
electrons (electron donors), while others gain elec-
trons (electron acceptors). A series of balanced half-
reactions ( Table 2 ) can then be written to describe a
biological process, such as nitrification, denitrifica-
tion, or oxidation of carbohydrates. McCarty (1971,
1975) developed a series of half-reactions for a variety
of electron donor and electron acceptors which wereused to develop the relationships presented here (seeTable 3 ).
When an electron donor is used for both energy and
cell synthesis the split between the electron flow is givenby:

Where C 5H7O2N represents the chemical formula for microbial biomass, and Rxn corresponds to McCarty nomenclature.349 J.M. Ebeling et al. / Aquaculture 257 (2006) 346 –358A free energy balance can then be used to estimate the
values for feandfs. LetΔGr=free energy released per eeq
of electron donor converted for energy (respiration).
Next combine a donor reaction with an acceptor reaction
to balance electrons. For example, Rxn (19) –Rxn (3)
from Table 2 can be used, i.e., ammonia –nitrogen being
oxidized to NO 3−with O 2as the acceptor.
LetΔGs=ATP energy required to synthesize 1eeq of
cells from whatever the carbon and nitrogen sources are.
Then let A=eeq of electron donor converted to energy
per eeq of cells synthesized, ignoring endogenous celldecay or maintenance energy.

same rate they are using ATP. Therefore:

‘A’is eeq of electron donor used for energy per eeq of

ε=0.6. McCarty (1972) uses pyruvate as an intermedi-
ate in the synthesis process, i.e., organic compounds are
first converted to pyruvate then to cell matter throughsome metabolic pathway.
So the energy process occurs in two steps.
Step 1: ΔG

conversion of the carbon source to pyruvate (kcal/eeq

Step 2 : Conversion of pyruvate and NH 4+to 1eeq

ΔGC=7.5 kcal.

If volatile suspended solids (VSS) are used as a
measure of bacterial biomass, then some of the VSS
produced and then endogenously decayed is non-degradable. According to Rittmann and McCarty

be converted to more common yield coefficient withunits of mass of cells produced per mass of substrate
(electron donor) used. For example, for autotrophicgrowth cell mass can be represented as C
5H7O2N
(MW=113 g) and the electron donor is N 4+–N
(MW=14 g). From the reactions shown in Table 2 it
can be seen that 1/8 mol of N 4+–N will yield 1 mol of
electrons and 1/20 mol of cell mass can be produced by1 mol of electrons. So if one prefers to use yield

reported in Tables 8 –11 of Wastewater Engineering
(Metcalf and Eddy Inc., 1991 ).
Using this stoichiometric relationship (Eq. (14)), for
every g of ammonia –nitrogen converted to nitrate –
nitrogen, 4.18 g of dissolved oxygen, and 7.05 g of
alkalinity (1.69 g inorganic carbon) are consumed and0.20 g of microbial biomass (0.105 g organic carbon) and5.85 g of CO
2, (1.59 g inorganic carbon) are produced. It
should be noted that both the consumption of oxygen andalkalinity is less than that which normally reported,4.57 g of O
2and 7.14 g of alkalinity for every g of
ammonia –nitrogen converted ( Timmons et al., 2002 ),
because in this equation some of the ammonia –nitrogen
is converted to biomass. Traditionally, this biomass hasnot been included in the stoichiometric relationship be-cause it is minor in comparison to the other factors. Table 3
summarizes the stoichiometry for metabolism of 1 g ofammonia –nitrogen by autotrophic bacterial, including
the consumption and production of organic and inor-
ganic carbon.
4.3. Autotrophic bacteria —impact on water quality
In the autotrophic nitrification process as opposed to
heterotrophic processes, very small amounts of bacterial
biomass are produced. And because of the relativelyslow maximum growth rate for the nitrifiers in a sus-pended-growth process, it becomes very easy to ‘wash-

system. This is particularly true if there is no sludge
recycling that returns the bacteria back into the culturesystem. Also there is a significant amount of alkalinityconsumed (7.05 g (as CaCO
3)/g N) and high levels of
carbon dioxide produced (5.85 g CO 2/g TAN). For
water with low initial alkalinity this can be a significantproblem, requiring the addition of alkalinity, in the
form of sodium bicarbonate, lime, sodium hydroxide, to
maintain an adequate concentration (100 to 150 mg/L asCaCO
3), especially for systems with limited water ex-
change. If alkalinity consumption is not compensatedfor by supplementation, the system pH will drop. Low-ering pH will result in an inorganic carbon species shiftfrom bicarbonate to dissolved carbon dioxide, and thisincrease in dissolved carbon dioxide could affect some
aquaculture species. Although CO
2concentration can be
controlled with gas stripping towers, significant energy
is required for pumping both the water and air throughthese systems. The end product of the reaction isnitrate –nitrogen, which is not normally toxic at
moderate levels in aquaculture production systems,e.g., several hundred mg/L.
4.4. Autotrophic bacteria —impact of C/N ratio
The ratio of the biodegradable organic carbon to the
nitrogen available for nitrification is argued to be one of
the critical factors affecting the design and operation ofa nitrification system ( U.S. EPA, 1993 ). Heterotrophic
bacteria have a maximum growth rate significantlyhigher than nitrifiers, 5 day
−1compared to 1 day−1
(U.S. EPA, 1993 ), thus in systems with even relatively
modest C/N ratios, the heterotrophs are capable of outperforming and significantly inhibiting nitrification.Zhu and Chen (2001) demonstrated the effect of sucrose
on the nitrification rate of biofilters under steady-stateconditions. They determined that at carbon/nitrogenratios from 1.0 to 2.0, there was a 70% reduction oftotal ammonia –nitrogen removal rate as compared to
C/N=0. The data suggested that the nitrification ratedecreased with an increase in the organic concentration,but the impact became less pronounced when the carbonconcentration became sufficiently high.
Additionally in suspended-growth process with high
C/N ratios, the increased production of heterotrophicbacteria requires that they be removed from the produc-tion system, i.e., using clarifiers. Since the yield of het-
erotrophic bacteria is greater than the yield of autotrophic
nitrifying bacteria there is the potential, when attemptingto control the TSS levels in the production system, thatthe nitrifiers will be washed out of the system.5. Heterotrophic bacteria
5.1. Background —heterotrophic bacteria
The major factors that affect the rate of nitrification
also play a dominant role in heterotrophic bacterial
growth. These include: pH, alkalinity, temperature, oxy-gen, ammonia, and salinity ( Timmons et al., 2002 ).
5.2. Stoichiometry —aerobic heterotrophic bacteria
Classical thermodynamics and the half-reaction rela-
tionships used above to describe the nitrification ofammonia –nitrogen to nitrate –nitrogen can also be used
to describe the removal of ammonia –nitrogen by incor-
poration into cell biomass ( Table 3 ). This process can be
enhanced by the addition of carbon in the form ofglucose, sucrose or any other form of carbohydrate. Thesame reaction for the bacterial cell synthesis is used;Rxn (1), along with the same reaction for the electronacceptor, Rxn (3), and in this case the electron donorbecomes sucrose or any carbohydrate, Rxn (16).
Consider the case where the electron donor is
sucrose, the electron acceptor is O
2and the nitrogen
source is NH 4+. The energetic calculations yield:

As previously stated, if volatile suspended solids
(VSS) are used as a measure of bacterial biomass, thensome of the VSS produced and then endogenously de-cayed is non-degradable. According to Rittmann and
McCarty (2001) 20% of the endogenously decayed VSS
is non-degradable. They showed that:

This equation predicts that for every g of ammonia –
nitrogen converted to microbial biomass, 4.71 g of dis-
solved oxygen and 3.57 g of alkalinity (0.86 g inorganic
carbon) and 15.17 g carbohydrates (6.07 g organic car-bon) are consumed. Also 8.07 g of microbial biomass(4.29 g organic carbon) and 9.65 g of CO
2(2.63 g inor-
ganic carbon) are produced. Note the oxygen demand isslightly higher, the alkalinity requirement about half andthe CO
2production almost 75% greater than the cor-
responding reaction for nitrification. Most importantly,
the increase in microbial biomass production is 40 times
greater than the biomass generated from the nitrificationprocess; 8.07 versus 0.20 g. Table 4 summarizes the
stoichiometry for the heterotrophic pathways for ammo-nia–nitrogen conversion.
5.3. Heterotrophic bacteria —impact on water quality
Several aspects are important in the overall hetero-
trophic bacterial reaction. Paramount is the extremelylarge amount of bacterial biomass produced by this reac-tion, compared to the autotrophic reaction. Thus someform of solids management to remove excess TSS isrequired. A second issue is the modest amount of alka-linity consumed as the carbon source (3.57 g/g TAN) andthe resulting high levels of carbon dioxide produced
(9.65 g/g TAN). For water with low initial alkalinity, this
will generally still require the addition of carbonate,usually in the form of sodium bicarbonate to maintainreasonable alkalinity (100 to 150 mg/L as CaCO
3), es-pecially for systems with limited water exchange. As aresult, zero-exchange production systems that rely onsuspended or attached heterotrophic bacteria usuallyshow a modest decrease in alkalinity, large suspendedsolids production, and high CO
2levels. Finally, there
should be no production of nitrite –nitrogen, or nitrate –
nitrogen in a pure heterotrophic system.
6. Conversion of 1 kg of feed at 35% protein
Relating this analysis to the production of marine
shrimp in a zero-exchange system, it can be assumed that
for every kg of feed at 35% protein, approximately 50.4 gof ammonia– nitrogen will be generated, Eq. (2). Several
different nitrogen pathways are available for the system.These are dependent upon the availability of carbon and
it forms, either as inorganic carbon as alkalinity or or-
ganic carbon from the feed and fecal matter or as sup-plemental carbohydrates. Thus for a recirculating systemwhere all of the solids containing organic carbon arerapidly removed from the system, the system would beprimarily autotrophic, utilizing inorganic carbon fromthe alkalinity as its carbon source. For a zero-exchangesystem, the solids remain in the production tank and all
of the carbon and nitrogen from the feed and fecal matter
are available for heterotrophic bacterial production. Inthis case, because there is insufficient organic carbon tocompletely convert the nitrogen to heterotrophic bacte-rial biomass, some limited autotrophic conversion oc-curs, which utilizes inorganic carbon from the alkalinity.If however sufficient supplemental organic carbon isadded, as for example carbohydrates, then all of the
nitrogen is converted to bacterial biomass via heterotro-
phic bacteria.
For a pure autotrophic nitrification process ( Table 5 )
the mass of microbial biomass generated as VSS can becalculated from the ammonia –nitrogen production rate
and the VSS yield, approximately 10.1 g VSS/kg of feed.Since bacterial biomass (VSS) contains 53.1% C and12.3% N (based on stoichiometry), this translates into
5.35 g of organic carbon and only 1.25 g of nitrogen
sequestered in the microbial biomass. It is interesting tonote, that only about 6.2% of the carbon available isactually contained in the microbial biomass (5.35 g), andmost of the carbon is released as carbon dioxide (295 g).In addition, only 2.5% of the nitrogen is sequestered inthe bacterial biomass, again the majority of the nitrogenis converted to nitrate –nitrogen (49.2 g NO
3–N). The
source of the inorganic carbon required by theautotrophic bacteria is from the consumption of 355 gof alkalinity as CaCO
3. The C/N ratio for optimal con-
version by autotrophic systems works out to be 1.69 g353 J.M. Ebeling et al. / Aquaculture 257 (2006) 346 –358inorganic carbon/g nitrogen, compared to the microbial
biomass C/N ratio of 4.28 g organic carbon/g nitrogen.
In a pure zero-exchange system ( Table 6 ), all of the
solids remain in the production tank and all of the organic
carbon and nitrogen from the feed and fecal matter is
available for heterotrophic bacterial production. Sincethe energetics of heterotrophic bacteria is more favorablethan those for autotrophic bacteria, it will be assumedthat the heterotrophic bacteria will first consume theavailable nitrogen using the readily available, labilecarbon from the feed and fecal matter. The availableorganic carbon from feed and fecal matter is difficult toestimate due the wide variation in feed formulations,
species assimilation rates, rate of nutrient leaching from
the feed particles and numerous other difficulties. Thusas an approximation, we can use literature data toestimate that feeds exert 0.30 to 0.36 kg BOD/kg of feed(Zhu and Chen, 2001; Brune et al., 2003 ). Using aTable 5

(Brune et al., 2003 ), and a BOD content of 0.36 kg/kg
feed, suggests that a kg of feed would generate approxi-mately 144 g of heterotrophic VSS. Again since bacterial
biomass (VSS) contains 53.1% C and 12.3% N, this
translates into 76.5 g of organic carbon and 17.9 g ofnitrogen sequestered in the heterotrophic microbial bio-mass. In addition to the organic carbon from the feed andfecal matter (109.4 g), 15.4 g of inorganic carbon arerequired; this is obtained from the consumption of 64.0 gof alkalinity as CaCO
3.
Since there is 50.4 g of nitrogen available from the
feed, and only 17.9 g of nitrogen is sequestered by theheterotrophic bacteria, there remains 32.5 g of nitrogento be assimilated by the autotrophic bacteria. Againusing 0.20 g VSS/g of nitrogen, yields a production of6.5 g of autotrophic bacteria VSS. Since bacterial bio-mass (VSS) contains 53.1% C and 12.3% N, thistranslates into 3.45 g of organic carbon and only 0.81 g ofnitrogen sequestered in the autotrophic microbial bio-
mass. Thus, only a small fraction of the nitrogen is se-
questered by the autotrophic bacteria, most of thenitrogen is contained in the nitrate –nitrogen (31.7 g)
and most of the carbon is released as carbon dioxide(51.7 g). The source of the inorganic carbon (55.4 g)required by the autotrophic bacteria is the consumption
of 288.3 g of alkalinity as CaCO
3. Thus two forms of
carbon are consumed during this pathway, 108.9 g of
organic carbon and 15.4 g of inorganic carbon. Theresulting C/N ratio based on the organic carbon is 2.16.Although the exact percentage is dependent upon theprotein content of the feed, in this case 35.6% of thenitrogen is removed by the heterotrophic pathway and64.4% by the autotrophic pathway. Note that only 4.3%
of the VSS are from autotrophic bacteria, demonstrating
how quickly heterotrophic bacteria will dominate asystem with adequate organic carbon. And also how easyit is to ‘wash-out ’autotrophic bacteria during harvesting
of excess bacterial biomass, since the autotrophic bac-teria growth rate is significantly slower than the het-erotrophic bacteria.
Finally consider a zero-exchange system where car-
bon is added to make up the difference between theavailable organic carbon from feed (108.9 g) and theTable 7

stoichiometry, 15.17 g of carbohydrates are required per
g of N, or 764.9 g of carbohydrates containing 305.9 gof organic carbon. As was shown above, feed providesonly 108.9 g of organic carbon, so the remaining 197 gmust be made up for with a supplemental carbon source.The carbon available from a generic carbohydrate(C
6H12O6) is 0.40 g C per g carbohydrate. Thus to
add the additional 197 g of carbon, would require
approximately 492 g of carbohydrate, or 49% by weight
of the feed. Overall, a total of 305.9 g of organic carbonwould be required to convert heterotrophically 50.4 g ofN. This yields a C/N ratio of 6.07.
The above analysis is for a feed with a protein content
of 35%. Additional calculations for other feed proteincontent are straightforward with additional organic car-bon supplementation at high protein level, i.e. high
ammonia –nitrogen production. Fig. 1 shows this rela-tionship for feed protein contents from 15% to 55% andas a percent of feed the required to provide the necessary
supplemental carbohydrate required for complete het-erotrophic metabolism of the ammonia nitrogen pro-duced from the feed being fed to the shrimp.
7. Impact of C/N ratio
For wastewater treatment suspended growth systems,
it has been determined that the fraction of nitrifying
bacteria found in the mixed liquor is reasonably wellrelated to the BOD
5to TKN ratio ( Metcalf and Eddy Inc.,
1991 ). Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is determined by
digestion of the sample in boiling sulfuric acid, where theorganic nitrogen is converted to ammonia and subse-quent measurement of ammonia –nitrogen by Nessler-
ization method. Thus TKN is the sum of the organic and
ammonia –nitrogen, or from a wastewater treatmentTable 8

the available nitrogen to nitrate –nitrogen. Table 8 shows
the fraction of nitrifiers to heterotrophs as a function ofthe BOD
5/TKN ratio ( Metcalf and Eddy Inc., 1991 ). It
can be seen from this table that as the BOD 5/TKN ratio
increases the fraction of nitrifying bacterial falls offquickly. Since BOD
5is approximately a measure of the
oxygen consumed by the organic carbon, using a simple
mass balance suggests that the ratio of carbon to oxygen
consumption should be 12 g mol C to 32 g mol O 2or
0.375 g carbon/g oxygen. The modified BOD 5/TKN
column reflects this adjustment to an approximate C/Nratio. In a zero-exchange system without carbon sup-plementation 1 kg of aquaculture feed contains ap-proximately 109 g of labile carbon and removesapproximately 18 g of ammonia –nitrogen via heterotro-
phic bacteria. The remaining ammonia– nitrogen is re-
moved via autotrophic bacteria using alkalinity as theinorganic carbon source. Based on the previouslydeveloped stoichiometry, VSS production for both theheterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria can be estimated.Table 8 presents C/N ratios for aquaculture feeds and
demonstrates the same rapid fall off in the fraction ofnitrifiers to heterotrophs as the C/N ratio increases. Fig. 2
shows the excellent correspondence between aquacul-ture C/N ratio or modified BOD
5/TKN ratio and the
fraction of nitrifying VSS for wastewater treatment sus-pended growth systems.
Zhu and Chen (2001) demonstrated the effect of
sucrose carbon on the nitrification rate of biofilters understeady-state conditions using an experimental system.They determined at carbon/nitrogen ratios from 1.0 to
2.0, which are where most RAS systems operate, there
was a 70% reduction of total ammonia –nitrogen removal
rate as compared to C/N ratio of zero. Table 8 supports
this observation, with a reduction from 67% at a C/Nratio of 2.0 to 84% at a ratio of 1.0.
8. Conclusions
The three pathways for nitrogen removal are all
very different in terms of substrate utilization, bacterial
biomass generated and by-products. The difficulty inthe complex world of production aquaculture is that allthree may be present to some degree and compete forthe same substrate. The ability to control the carbon tonitrogen ratio by feed formulation, solids removal, oraddition of organic carbon does allow the aquaculture
producer to manage what type of system is used. In the
end though, it is the cultured species that determinewhich system is most appropriate based on their waterquality needs.Acknowledgements
