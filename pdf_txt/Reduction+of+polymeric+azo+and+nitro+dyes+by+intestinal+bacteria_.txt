The human gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that are r esponsible for the modification of 
many orally administered drugs , leading to a wide range of therapeutic outcomes. Prodrugs 
bearing an azo bond are designed to treat inflammatory bowel di sease (IBD) and colorectal 
cancer (CRC) via microbial azo reduction, allowing for topical application of therapeutic moieties 
to the diseased tissue in the intestines. Despite the inextricable link between microbial azo 
reduction and the efficacy of azo prodrugs, the prevalence, abundance, and distribution of azoreductases have not been systematically examined across the gut microbiome. Here, we 
curated and clustered amino acid sequences of experimentally confirmed bacterial azoreductases and conducted a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-driven homolog search for these 
enzymes across 4,644 genome sequences present in the representa tive Unified Human 
Gastrointestinal Genomes (UHGG) collection. We identified 1,958 putative azo-reducing species, corroborating previous findings that azo reduction appears to be a ubiquitous function of the gut microbiome. However , through a systematic comparison  of predicted and confirmed 
azo-reducing strains, we hypothesize the presence of uncharacterized azoreductases in 25 prominent strains of the human gu t microbiome. Finally, we confirmed the azo reduction of Acid 
Orange 7 by multiple strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Clostridium 
clostridioforme. Together, these results suggest the presence and activity of many 
uncharacterized azoreductases i n the human gut microbiome and m otivate future studies aimed 
at characterizing azoreductase genes in prominent members of th e human gut microbiome. 
Significance Statement : In this work, we systematically examined the prevalence, abundance, 
and distribution of azoreductases across the healthy and IBD hu man gut microbiome revealing 
potentially uncharacterized azoreductase genes. We also confirm ed the reduction of Acid 
Orange 7 by strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Clostridium 
clostridioforme.  This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward. Published on September 18, 2022 as DOI: 10.1124/dmd.122.000898 at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 dmd.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from  5INTRODUCTION  
 
Orally administered drugs are an attractive, non-invasive mode of delivery of 
pharmaceuticals to the intestines. The human gut microbiome pla ys an important role in drug 
metabolism (Spanogiannopoulos et al. 2016) and is capable of ac tivating (Peppercorn and 
Goldman 1972; Morrison, Wright, and John 2012; Sousa et al. 201 4), inactivating (Kalman 
1978; Dobkin et al. 1983; Haiser et al. 2013), and even toxifyi ng (Wallace et al. 2010) 
pharmaceutical drugs. Prodrugs containing an azo bond actually require bacterial azoreductase 
activity to release biologically active compounds (Peppercorn a nd Goldman 1972). For 
conditions such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and colorec tal cancer (CRC), bacterial 
azoreductases have been utilized to deliver therapeutics such a s 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), 
prednisolone (Ruiz et al. 2011), and celecoxib (Marquez Ruiz et  al. 2011) topically to diseased 
intestinal tissues (Figure 1). Following oral administration of sulfasalazine, bacterial azoreductases in the gut reduce azo bonds, liberating 5-ASA and allowing it to confer its anti-inflammatory properties (Mahida et al. 1991; Weber et al. 2000; Rachmilewitz et al. 1992) 
topically on inflamed intestinal tissue. Direct oral administra tion of 5-ASA is non-optimal 
because the majority of the drug is absorbed in the small intestine and is sent through systemic circulation (Peppercorn and Goldman 1973; Tozaki et al. 2002; Friend 2005; Perrotta et al. 
2015; Foppoli et al. 2019). Other examples of azo-bonded prodrugs are OPN501 and celecoxib-5-ASA. OPN501 is made of up prednisolone, 5-ASA, and an inert c yclization product, 
Dihydroquinolone (DHQ). Upon azo reduction, 5-ASA is released a nd is able to act topically 
upon the target tissue. Following a spontaneous cyclization rea ction, prednisolone and DHQ are 
released where prednisolone can act upon the target tissue (Rui z et al. 2011). Celecoxib-5-ASA 
is made up of celecoxib, 5-ASA, and DHQ, which are all released upon azo reduction and cyclization in a similar mechanistic fashion to OPN501 (Marquez Ruiz et al. 2011).

azoreductases and described their preferred flavin cofactors an d electron donors (H. Suzuki 
2019). They found that bacterial azoreductases qualitatively cl uster into four main clades, which 
harbor a preference for either flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or f lavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) 
as the flavin cofactor, and either NADH or NADPH as the preferred electron donor. Clades I, II, 
and III are flavoproteins whereas Clade IV proteins are flavin-free. Clade I azoreductases prefer 
NADPH as the electron donor, Clade II prefers NADH as its electron donor, and Clades III and 
IV generally use both. Of the 37 enzymes examined by Suzuki 2019, eight enzymes formed no 
distinct phylogenetic clade and featured differences in primary sequence length, flavin cofactor, and preferred electron donor. In addition to their relevance in  drug delivery and efficacy, 
azoreductases are involved in nitroreduction (Brown 1981; Rafii , Franklin, and Cerniglia 1990; 
Rafii and Cerniglia 1995; Liu et al. 2007; Mercier et al. 2013;  Chalansonnet et al. 2017), quinone 
oxidoreduction (Liu et al. 2008; Leelakriangsak et al. 2008; Ry an, Wang, et al. 2010; Ryan et al. 
2014), and azo dye reduction. Azo dyes such as Allura Red and B rilliant Black are commonly 
used in the food and textile industries, and waste from their production and usage pollutes the 
environment. This has led to a plethora of manuscripts characterizing the activity of 
azoreductases across the bacterial kingdom (Misal et al. 2014; Cerniglia et al. 1982; Feng, Cerniglia, and Chen 2012; T. Zimmermann, Kulla, and Leisinger 1 982; Nakanishi et al. 2001; Y. 
Suzuki et al. 2001; Silke Blümel, Knackmuss, and Stolz 2002; S.  Blümel and Stolz 2003; H. 
Chen, Wang, and Cerniglia 2004; Nachiyar and Rajakumar 2005; H. Chen, Hopper, and Cerniglia 2005; Ooi et al. 2007; Matsumoto et al. 2010; Misal et al. 2011; Gonçalves et al. 2013; 
Lang et al. 2013; Zhang, Ng, and Chang 2016; Eslami, Amoozegar,  and Asad 2016) , many of 
which exhibit non-negligible sequence similarity to gut microbi al azoreductases (H. Suzuki 
2019).  
There is a growing body of literature suggesting that azo reduction is a ubiquitous 
function of the human gut microbiome (Javdan et al. 2020) with many prominent bacterial This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward.

Zimmermann et al. 2019). 
Javdan et al. 2020 showed that among 20 different individuals, sulfasalazine reduction was one 
of the only ubiquitous functions of the gut microbiome. Zimmerm ann et al. 2019 tested the 
reduction of sulfasalazine by 76 prominent strains of the gut m icrobiome and reported a 
significant (FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05) reduction of sulfasal azine by 62 of these strains. 
Interestingly, some of these experimentally confirmed azo-reduc ing strains reported by 
Zimmermann et al. 2019 have no prior evidence of azo-reduction,  and thus, may encode novel 
or uncharacterized azoreductase genes ( Figure 1C ). Identification of known azoreductases in 
newly reported sulfasalazine reducing species can help narrow d own strains to target for 
identification of uncharacterized azoreductases. 
The prevalence, abundance, expression, and distribution of azor eductase enzymes in 
the human gut microbiome have implications for the efficacy of existing prodrugs mentioned 
above, as well as for the development of future azo prodrugs. W hile azoreductases have been 
identified and characterized in many gut bacteria ( Supp. Table 1 ), the distribution of 
azoreductases has not been systematically explored across currently gut bacterial reference 
genomes. To address this gap, we conducted a homolog search of known azoreductases 
across the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genomes (UHGG) collec tion (Almeida et al. 2020) to 
identify putative azoreductases and azo-reducing species in the  human gut microbiome. We 
then assessed the relative abundance and expression of known az oreductases in healthy, 
ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn’s disease (CD) participants of the Integrative Human 
Microbiome Project (HMP2) (Proctor and Huttenhower 2019), the P rospective Registry of IBD 
Patients at MGH (PRISM) (Franzosa et al. 2019), and the Health Professionals Followup Study 
(HPFS) (Abu-Ali et al. 2018). Finally, we tested the in vitro  azo reduction of Acid Orange 7 by 
three strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum along with two strains of Bacteroides fragilis  and two 
strains of Clostridium clostridioforme .   This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward.

Prospective Registry of IBD Patients at MGH (PRISM) (N(samples)  = 218, N(individuals) = 218)  
(Franzosa et al. 2019), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) (N(samples) =

samples referred to throughout this work are human stool sample s. 
Curation of HMMs representing azoreductase enzymes 
We searched the literature for known and experimentally validat ed species of bacteria which 
have azoreductase activity. The list of gene sequences collecte d, along with the relevant 
metadata (organism, functional annotation, length, etc.) is ava ilable in Supp. Table 1. 
Preliminary evidence for azoreductase gene sequence clustering is shown in Suzuki 2019 
where sequences were aligned and phylogenetically compared. Nex t, after collecting 40 
sequences of experimentally vali dated azoreductases, we generat ed a sequence similarity 
network (SSN) using EFI-EST (Gerlt et al. 2015) at a 35% amino acid sequence identity 
threshold for identifying similar clusters of azoreductase genes. This threshold corroborates the 
preliminary evidence for a diversity of azoreductase sequences put forth by Suzuki 2019. With 
the exception of Clade IVb sequences, which reached 31% sequenc e identity, all other clusters 
of genes had at least 35% sequence identity. The groups shown in Figure 2 were pressed into 
profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using HMMER version 3.1b2 ( Finn et al. 2015). Other 
genes that did not fall into the Clade I - Clade IV clusters ( arsH, yieF, mdaB , azo1, azoR , etc.), 
were pressed into singular HMMs and included in the homolog sea rch. This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward.

We searched HMMs of known, experimentally validated azoreductas es across 4,644 non-
redundant genomes contained in the UHGG collection (Almeida et al. 2020) using HMMER 
v3.1b2 (Finn et al. 2015). Alignments to queried HMMs with E-va lue <1x10-10 and 60% coverage 
of the query sequence were labeled as putative azoreductase gen e sequences. Putative azo-
reducing bacterial species with experimentally confirmed azored uctase activity ( Supp. Table 2 ) 
were then labeled as “known” azo-reducing species and classifie d separately from the putative 
azo-reducing species. Putative azo-reducing species across the bacterial taxonomy were 
visualized using the iTOL web interface (Letunic and Bork 2019) and prominent phyla of the gut 
microbiome were subsetted and presented in Figure 3.  
Relative abundance and azoreducta se gene abundanc e and expressi on 
estimation 
Raw sequencing reads for samples from HMP2 (Proctor and Huttenh ower 2019), PRISM 
(Franzosa et al. 2019), and HPFS (Abu-Ali et al. 2018), were do wnloaded and extracted with 
NCBI’s SRA toolkit v2.10.9 (“SRA-Tools - NCBI” n.d.). Quality control and adapter trimming of 
the fastq sequence files were done with the Trim Galore wrapper  v0.6.6 (“Babraham 
Bioinformatics - Trim Galore!” n.d.). To remove potential human contaminants, quality trimmed 
reads were screened against the human genome (hg19) with Bowtie2 v2.4.2 (Langmead and 
Salzberg 2012). Putative azoreductase sequences were extracted from UHGG genomes via 
custom shell and python scripts. Putative azoreductase gene seq uences (HMP2, PRISM) and 
expression levels (HPFS) were quantified using salmon v1.4.0 (P atro et al. 2017) and were 
normalized and aggregated in R v4.1.1 and were subsequently vis ualized using the R package 
ggplot2 (Wickham 2011) (Figure 4). Taxonomy profiling of the cleaned metagenomic reads 
from HMP2 samples was performed using Kraken 2 v2.0.8-beta (Wood, Lu, and Langmead 
2019) to estimate the relative abundance of bacterial species p resent in each dataset. These 
relative abundances were then processed in R v4.1.1 and plotted  using ggplot2 ( Figure 5). All This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Statistical analysis of relative metagenomic sequence data from HMP2 and 
PRISM datasets  
Statistical analyses described in Figure 4 were performed in R 4.1.1 with the wilcoxon.test 
method using default parameterization. Next, we compared the re lative abundances of known 
and putative azo-reducing species for HMP2 subjects with 20 or more stool samples taken over 
the course of the study ( Figure 5). A linear mixed effects model analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
was performed on this subset of HMP2 data to determine any statistically significant differences 
in relative abundance values across nonIBD, UC, and CD subjects . The R package lme4 (Bates 
et al. 2014) was used to fit the model to the data and the package lmerTest (Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, and Christensen 2017) was used to perform the ANOVA on the model. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.1.1 and are provided at

Acid Orange 7 azo reduction assay 
Biological triplicates were grown in a ten ml tube containing 10 ml of Yeast Casitone Fatty Acids 
(YCFA) broth for Bacteroides fragilis  and Clostridium clostridioforme  strains and 10ml of Brain 
Heart Infusion (BHI) broth for Fusobacterium nucleatum  strains. Each tube was inoculated with 
10 μL of bacteria from glycerol stocks. The final concentration s of each substrate in the bacterial 
cultures were: 50 μg/ml of FMN, 50 μg/ml of NADH, and 50 μmol/m l of Acid Orange 7. The 
bacterial cultures were left to grow in an anaerobic chamber fo r 72 hours, and Acid Orange 7 
decolorization was measured once every 24 hours since inoculation. The decolorization of Acid Orange 7 was measured by aliquoting triplicates of 200 μL media  aliquants to a 96-well plate for

Primary amino acid sequences of bacterial azoredu ctases group b y 
mechanistic preferences  
 
To begin identifying putative azo-reducing species of the gut m icrobiome, we searched 
the literature for experimentally  verified azoreductase enzymes , collected amino acid sequences 
and metadata for these azoreductases ( Supp. Table 1 ), and compared their primary sequences 
using the Enzyme Function Initiative-Enzyme Similarity Tool (EF I-EST) (Gerlt et al. 2015). The 
resulting sequence similarity network captured mechanistic pref erences such as flavin 
dependence and electron donor preference for each azoreductase reported by Suzuki 2019. We 
saw near complete concordance between the Clade I-IV azoreducta ses and the sequence 
similarity clusters at a 35% amino acid identity edge threshold , with the exception of Clade IV, 
which was split into two separate clusters (Figure 2). The gene families labeled arsH, mdaB, 
yieF, and azo1 clustered separately from Clade I-IV azoreductas es, and we consider each of 
these clusters as separate sub-families of azoreductases. Multiple sequence alignments were 
generated for each cluster shown in Figure 2 (with the exception of the “Other Azoreductases” 
group) using MUSCLE v3.8.425 (Edgar 2004). Hidden Markov Models  (HMMs) were then 
trained on the multiple sequence al ignments from the previous s tep using the HMMER v3.1b2 
method hmmpress (Finn et al. 2015) and were queried against the UHGG collection (Almeida et 
al. 2020).  
Homolog search for azoreductases supports evidence for ubiquity  of azo 
reduction by the human gut microbiome 
We searched for homologs of azoreductases across 4,644 represen tative genomes in 
the UHGG collection (Almeida et al. 2020) using HMMs generated from sequences of 
experimentally validated azoreductase enzymes ( Figure 3). This collection contains 204,938 
genome sequences of bacteria known to inhabit the human gut, of  which 4,644 are included in This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward.

For the remainder of this work, we refer to 
species receiving statistically significant (E-value < 1x10-10) hits to azoreductase genes as 
“putative azo-reducing species” or “putative azo-reducing bacte ria''. Of the 4,644 genomes in 
the UHGG collection, there are 1,443 (31.1%) with one putative azoreductase gene, 343 (7.4%) 
with two or more putative azoreductases, and 372 (8.0%) with th ree or more putative 
azoreductases, indicating the extensive potential of the gut microbiome to reduce azo bonds. 
Most notably, 364 genomes contain hits to the Clade I profile, 452 contain hits to the Clade II 
profile, 793 genomes contain hits to the Clade III profile, 568 contain hits to the Clade IVa profile, 410 contain hits to the Clade IVb profile, 285 contain hits to the mdaB  profile, and 477 
contain hits to the yieF profile. Prominent phyla of the gut microbiome such as Proteobacteria 
and Firmicutes appear particularly rich with Clade I, Clade II, Clade III, Clade IVab, and FAD 
utilizing azoreductases (purple columns in Figure 3). 
Systematic evaluation of pre dicted azo-reducing species 
We next sought to evaluate the results of our azoreductase homo log search with recent findings 
by Zimmermann et al. 2019 regarding sulfasalazine reduction. Zimmermann et al. 2019 tested the degradation of sulfasalazine by 76 prominent gut bacterial strains, 67 of which had corresponding reference genomes present in the UHGG collection.  This provided an excellent 
source of data to compare our bioinformatic predictions against . We determined the 
sulfasalazine reducing status as either sulfasalazine reducing (SR) or non-sulfasalazine 
reducing (nonSR) for each of the 67 strains based on the signif icant (FDR adjusted p-value < 
0.05) reduction of sulfasalazine in vitro  reported by Zimmermann et al. 2019 (Table 1).  We also 
determined the predicted reducing status as either a predicted reducer (PR) or a non-predicted 
reducer (nonPR) for each strain based on the presence of a putative azoreductase identified 
from the homolog search step. For each strain, the sulfasalazin e reducing status and predicted 
reducing status were compared to systematically validate the re sults of the azoreductase This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

We correctly predicted t he sulfasalazine reducing 
status for 47.8% (32/67) of strains and we incorrectly predicte d the sulfasalazine reducing status 
for 52.2% (35/67) of strains (Table 2). The vast majority (77.1 %, 27/35) of incorrectly predicted 
strains are false negatives, meaning, the strain does reduce su lfasalazine in vitro , but we did not 
identify an azoreductase in the homolog search step (Table 2). Interestingly, the majority of 
false positives (75%, 6/8) are members of the Proteobacteria ph ylum which we previously noted 
to be particularly rich in azoreductase gene sequences ( Figure 3 ).  
Exploratory analysis of azoreduc tase abundance and expression l evels in 
the human gut microbiome 
After identifying putative azo-reducing species of the human gut microbiome, we next sought to 
examine the abundance and expression of putative azoreductases using publicly available 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets. We used shotgun me tagenomic sequence data 
from the Human Microbiome Project 2 (HMP2) (Proctor and Huttenh ower 2019) and the 
Prospective registry of IBD patients at MGH (PRISM) (Franzosa e t al. 2019) to quantify 
azoreductase gene abundance. We also used high throughput metat ranscriptomic sequence 
data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) (Abu-Ali et al. 2018) to quantify the expression of azoreductases by the human gut microbiota ( Figure 4A-C ). Briefly, raw genomic 
and transcriptomic reads were filtered and processed using fast p (S. Chen et al. 2018), and 
azoreductases were quantified using salmon v1.4.0 (Patro et al.  2017). Please see the Materials 
and Methods section for more details on the computational and s tatistical procedures used.  
Significant differences in azoreductase gene abundances between  disease conditions 
are displayed in Figure 4A-B  with asterisks. We find that Clade I, Clade II, Clade III, Clade IVa, 
Clade IVb, mdaB, and yieF genes are considerably higher in abun dance than ferB, 
azoR1_cperf, arsH, azoR_ropacus, azo1, and azoR1_llentus within all three disease conditions

Clade IVa is higher in abundance than all other azoreductases across healthy, 
UC and CD cohorts from HMP2 ( Figure 4A ), but the same statistically significant difference was 
not observed in the PRISM study ( Figure 4B ). 
  The expression of Clade I, Clade II, Clade III, Clade IVa, md aB, and yieF azoreductases 
are significantly higher than those of Clade IVb, ferB, azoR1_cperf, arsH, azoR_ropacus, azo1, 
and azoR1_llentus azoreductases in healthy individuals (minimum  FDR adjusted p-value <

comparable to those of Clades I, II, III, and IVa, the expression levels of Clade IVb 
azoreductases are significantly lower in vivo than the expression Clade I, II, III, and IVa

The relative abundance of putativ e azo-reducing species fluctua tes over 
time 
We next sought to examine whether relative abundance levels of combined known and putative 
azo-reducing species are stable or fluctuate over time. The HMP2 dataset provides a unique opportunity to examine the stability of individuals’ gut microb iomes over time, as there are 18 
individuals across healthy, UC, and CD cohorts with at least 20  stool samples taken once every 
two weeks over a six-month period. In order to examine the stab ility of azo reduction in the 
human gut, we compared the relative abundance of known and puta tive azo-reducing species 
from these participants (Figure 5). The median relative abundance of combined azo-reducing species ranges from 20.3 ± 3.58% to 33.9 ± 19.2% for nonIBD, 21 .7 ± 7.6% to 49.0 ± 15.0% for 
UC, and 34.9 ± 6.39 to 62.3 ± 18.8 for CD subjects. Using linea r mixed effects model ANOVA, 
we found that combined azo-reducing species are significantly m ore abundant in CD subjects 
than in nonIBD subjects (p = 0.002) and are not significantly more abundant in UC subjects than in nonIBD subjects (p = 0.064) ( Figure 5A ).

Multiple strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and  
Clostridium clostridioforme  reduce Acid Orange 7 in vitro  
Finally, we sought to test the azo reduction of Acid Orange 7 by three strains of the health-
relevant (Castellarin et al. 2012; Kostic et al. 2012; Bashir et al. 2015; Abed et al. 2016) 
microbe, Fusobacterium nucleatum . As well, we tested the azo reduction of Acid Orange 7 by 
two positive control species, Bacteroides fragilis , and Clostridium clostridioforme . Acid Orange 7 
is an azo-bonded dye commonly used in the food and textile indu stries (Bay et al. 2014), and 
the decolorization of azo-bonded dyes is commonly used to test azo reduction by bacteria in 
vitro (Feng, Cerniglia, and Chen 2012) . F. nucleatum  CTI-06, F. nucleatum  subsp. animalis 
D11, and F. nucleatum  subsp. polymorphum were grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) me dia, 
and Acid Orange 7 was added to the culture after four days of g rowth (Materials and Methods). 
We also tested the azo reduction of Acid Orange 7 by the known azo-reducing species 
Bacteroides fragilis  and Clostridium clostridiforme . B. fragilis  strains 3_1_12 and CL07T00C01 
and C. clostridioforme  strains 2_1_49_FAA and WAL-7855 were grown in Yeast Casitone F atty 
Acids (YCFA) broth and served as positive controls. We find tha t all strains examined in this 
assay significantly decolorized Acid Orange 7 in vitro  (Figure 6). To our knowledge, this is the 
first reporting of azo reduction by F. nucleatum  CTI-06, F. nucleatum  subsp. animalis D11, and 
F. nucleatum  subsp. polymorphum.

The presence of azo-reducing bacteria in the human gut is necessary for the effective 
delivery and activation of azo-bonded prodrugs. While azoreductase activity has been identified 
in several prominent phyla of the human gut microbiota (M. Zimm ermann et al. 2019) and 
appears to be ubiquitous across healthy individuals (Javdan et al. 2020), the prevalence, abundance, and distribution of azoreductases have not been syst ematically examined in the 
human gut microbiome of healthy individuals nor in individuals living with IBD. In this work, we 
curated and compiled known azoreductase genes ( Figure 2), searched for azoreductase gene 
families across a non-redundant set of 4,644 human gut bacteria l genomes (Almeida et al. 
2020), and identified 1,958 putative azo-reducing species ( Figure 3). The systematic 
comparison of our search results to recent experimental evidenc e of sulfasalazine reduction by 
prominent gut bacteria (Table 1, Table 2) indicates a disconnect between the current state of 
azoreductase annotation and experimental evidence of sulfasalazine reduction. Interestingly, the majority (77.1%, 27/35) of incorrectly predicted sulfasalaz ine reducing strains are false 
negatives, meaning, these strains did not return a significant hit to an azoreductase gene from 
the homolog search step but do in fact reduce sulfasalazine in vitro . This inconsistency between 
annotated azoreductases and experimental evidence of azo reduct ion suggests that many 
prominent bacterial strains of the human gut microbiome may enc ode and express previously 
uncharacterized azoreductase genes. These genes likely serve other endogenous roles such as 
nitro reduction (Liu et al. 2007; Chalansonnet et al. 2017) and quinone oxidoreduction (Liu et al. 
2008; Leelakriangsak et al. 2008; Ryan, Wang, et al. 2010; Ryan et al. 2014) with the azo reduction being a side mechanism that these enzymes cross-funct ionally participate in. 
We next sought to report the relative abundance and expression of azoreductases in the 
human gut microbiome for healthy controls and IBD patients. Our  analysis of 1,558 
metagenomic samples from 326 individuals across healthy, UC, an d CD patient cohorts showed 
that Clade I, II, III, IVa, IVb, mdaB, and yieF azoreductases are significantly more abundant in This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward. Published on September 18, 2022 as DOI: 10.1124/dmd.122.000898 at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 dmd.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from  18the gut microbiome compared to the other azoreductases examined in this study ( Figure 4A-B ). 
We also examined the expression of azoreductases by the human g ut microbiota and found 
that, with the exception of Clade IVb, expression levels of azo reductases roughly match with 
their corresponding genomic abundance ( Figure 4C ). The incongruence of Clade IVb 
abundance and expression levels suggests that, when feasible, s hotgun metagenomic 
sequencing of stool samples should be performed in parallel wit h metatranscriptomic 
sequencing to better understand the functional landscape of the  gut microbiome and the relative 
contributions of different azoreductases to overall azo reducti on. We also sought to examine the 
relative abundance of known and putative azo-reducing bacteria in healthy, UC, and CD 
patients over time. We found that the relative abundance of known and putative azo-reducing 
bacteria is significantly (p = 0.002) higher in individuals wit h CD and is modestly (p = 0.06) 
higher in individuals with UC compared to healthy controls ( Figure 5). This bodes well for the 
future of azo-bonded prodrug development because these therapie s are intended to treat 
individuals afflicted with UC and CD. However, the cumulative r elative abundance of known and 
putative azo-reducing bacteria fluctuates over time ( Figure 5B ) and future studies should 
explore whether there exists some minimum necessary abundance o f azo-reducing species for 
adequate prodrug metabolism and activation. 
Finally, we tested the reduction of the azo-bonded dye Acid Ora nge 7 by three strains of 
Fusobacterium nucleatum  alongside positive control strains of Bacteroides fragilis  and 
Clostridium clostridioforme  (Figure 6). Fusobacterium nucleatum  is positively correlated with 
colorectal cancer (Marchesi et al. 2011; Kostic et al. 2012), is present in and on cancerous tissue (Castellarin et al. 2012), and possibly contributes to t he etiology of the disease (McCoy et 
al. 2013; Rubinstein et al. 2013; Han 2015). We found that F. nucleatum  CTI-06, F. nucleatum  
subsp. animalis D11, and F. nucleatum  subsp. polymorphum all significantly reduce Acid 
Orange 7 in vitro , indicating the encoding and activity of azoreductases in these strains of F. 
nucleatum . The F. nucleatum  reference strain present in UHGG received significant hits to the This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

accurately predicted azo-reducing bacteria (Supp. Table 3). The identification and 
characterization of these, and possibly other, F. nucleatum  azoreductases could lead to the 
eventual development of an azo-bonded colorectal cancer therapeutic designed specifically to 
activate in the presence of F. nucleatum  on the surface of colonic tumors.  
Bacteroides fragilis  is a known reducer of azo dyes including Acid Orange 7 (this s tudy), 
Amaranth, Orange II, Tartrazine (Bragger et al. 1997), as well as of the quinone menadione (Ito 
et al. 2020). Additionally, many B. fragilis  strains have been shown to be potent reducers of 
sulfasalazine in vitro  (M. Zimmermann et al. 2019). While we did identify a significa nt (E-value < 
1x10-45) hit to the Clade IVa HMM in the two B. fragilis  reference strains present in UHGG 
(Supp. Table 3), there may be other B. fragilis  genes or operons that exhibit azoreductase 
activity. Ito et al. 2020 described two NADH:quinone oxidoreduc tase operons, NQR and NUO, 
and one NADH:quinone oxidoreductase gene, ndh2  capable of reducing the quinone 
menadione. Recall that bacterial quinone oxidoreductases are of ten cross-reactive with azo 
compounds and have even been proposed to be a part of the same FMN-dependent superfamily of NAD(P)H utilizing oxidoreductase enzymes (Ryan e t al. 2014). Future studies are 
required to confirm or deny that NQR, NUO, and ndh2  are hitherto uncharacterized 
azoreductases contributing to the complete azo reduction of sul fasalazine by B. fragilis  shown in 
Zimmerman et al. 2019. 
Of the seven bacterial strains tested for reduction of Acid Orange 7, the two Clostridium 
clostridioforme strains exhibited by far the most effective reduction of Acid Orange 7 (Figure 6). Although C. clostridioforme  is a known azo dye reducer (Raffi and Cerniglia 1990; Nakamura  et 
al. 2002; Xu et al. 2010), neither of the two reference strains  present in UHGG recruited 
significant alignments to known azoreductase gene families cura ted in the homolog search step 
of this work (Supp. Table 3). This could be the result of eithe r (i) strain-level variation between 
the reference strains and those tested with Acid Orange 7 in th is study, or (ii) the presence and This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward. Published on September 18, 2022 as DOI: 10.1124/dmd.122.000898 at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 dmd.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from  20activity of one or more uncharacterized azoreductases in C. clostridioforme . In either case, 
further research including a comparative genomics analysis and gene knockout experiment on 
various strains of C. clostridioforme  could lead to an improved understanding of gut microbial 
azo reduction. 
 This study has two primary limitations. 1. The E-value and per cent of alignment 
thresholds for determining a putative azoreductase in the homol og search step are not absolute, 
but rather, are designed to strike a balance between identifyin g spurious homologs and missing 
the identification of true azoreductase homologs. This is an in herent limitation of studies 
requiring hard cutoffs for homolog classification, and thus, is very difficult to avoid. 2. Bacterial azoreductases exhibit different substrate specificities (Ryan, Wang, et al. 2010; Lang et al. 
2013; Ryan, Laurieri, et al. 2010; Bin et al. 2004; Deller et a l. 2006; SUGIURA et al. 2006; Joshi 
et al. 2008; Mendes et al. 2011), and thus, have varying affinities for different azo prodrugs as 
well as azo dyes. Though we show a significant reduction of Aci d Orange 7 by three strains of 
Fusobacterium nucleatum  in this work, future experiments showing the reduction of azo drugs 
such as sulfasalazine would further bolster the hypothesis that  F. nucleatum  encodes and 
expresses one or more uncharacterized azoreductases. 
In conclusion, we show that known azoreductases are widely dist ributed in the human 
gut microbiome and that there are likely many more uncharacteri zed azoreductases encoded 
and expressed in the human gut microbiome. These results both ( i) bolster previous findings 
suggesting the ubiquity of azo-reduction in the gut microbiome (Javdan et al. 2020) and (ii) suggest the presence and activity of many hitherto uncharacteri zed azoreductases in the human 
gut microbiome. The list of false negative strains identified in our systematic comparison analysis can serve as a resource for future studies focused on identifying azoreductases encoded by the human gut microbiome (Table 1). Overall, this wo rk describes the abundance 
and distribution of known azoreductases in the human gut microb iome and motivates the need 
for future studies focused on annotating hitherto uncharacteriz ed azoreductases encoded in the This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Bacterial azoreductases cluster by cofactor and elect ron donor preferences.  
Following an extensive literature search for experimentally con firmed bacterial azoreductases, 
amino acid sequences of 40 azoreductase enzymes were collected and clustered with EFI-EST 
(Gerlt et al. 2015) at 35% sequence identity. Each node in the figure above is a single 
azoreductase gene and the edges between nodes indicate at least  35% sequence identity 
between the two amino acid sequences. The colored clusters, Clade I through Clade IVa and IVb, are groups of azoreductases previously described by Suzuki  2019 as mechanistically 
similar groups based on cofactor and electron donor preferences . Clusters labeled with gene 
names ( mdaB , yieF, etc.) represent homologous gene sequences found in two or mor e 
organisms. Each mechanistically characterized group of azoreductases were subsequently 
pressed into profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using HMMER v3 .1b2 (Finn et al. 2015) 
which formed the basis of the homologue search. The group label ed “other azoreductases” 
contains sequences that did not fall into any cluster at the 35 % identity threshold, and were 
pressed into singular HMMs prior to the homologue search.

Azoreductases are widely distributed across gut bacterial taxonomy.  
Presence/absence of azoreductases across prominent phyla of the  human gut microbiome. The 
taxonomic tree is obtained from the Unified Human Gastrointesti nal Genome collection (UHGG) 
(Almeida et al. 2020) which is built on the Genome Taxonomy Dat abase (GTDB) (Chaumeil et 
al. 2020). Phyla names are annotated on the left side. Phyla names followed by a capital letter, 
e.g., Firmicutes (A), indicate a novel phylum classified by the GTDB-tk. The bar chart in the 
center indicates the number of species contained in each genus shown in the tree. The size of 
the circles indicates the number of species which contain hits to the azoreductase genes 
specified. The color of the circles indicates the cofactor and preferred electron (e-) donor of the 
enzyme.

Project 2 also known as the Integrative Human Microbiome Projec t (HMP2) and the Prospective 
Registry in IBD Study at MGH (PRISM). We used salmon 1.4.0 (Pat ro et al. 2017) to quantify 
the abundance of azoreductase genes from hundreds of stool samp les across healthy controls 
(nonIBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s Disease (CD) parti cipant cohorts. Raw DNA read 
alignment counts were normalized to counts per million (CPM), a nalogous to transcripts per

were all obtained directly from Zimmermann et al. 2019 Supp. Table 3. The SR_status column 
contains values SR (sulfasalazine reducer) and nonSR (non sulfasalazine reducer) which were 
determined based on significant (p_FDR < 0.05) or non-significant (p_FDR >= 0.05) sulfasalazine reduction. The PR_status column contains the valu es PR (predicted sulfasalazine 
reducer) and nonPR (predicted sulfasalazine non-reducer) which were determined based on the 
presence or absence of one or more azoreductase homologs determ ined from the homolog 
search step. The final column, result, contains the values TP (true positive), TN (true negative), 
FP (false positive), and FN (false negative). Correctly predict ed SR strains have a result of TP 
and correctly predicted nonSR strains have a result of TN whereas incorrectly predicted SR strains have a result of FP and incorrectly predicted nonSR strains have a result of FN.
