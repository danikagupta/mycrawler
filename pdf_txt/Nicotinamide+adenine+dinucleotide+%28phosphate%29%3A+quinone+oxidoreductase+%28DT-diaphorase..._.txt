Abstract
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 
(NQ01; DT-diaphorase; DTD) is a two-electron reducing enzyme which is
often over-expressed in cancers and can activate quinones to form cytotoxic species. This over-expression is used
as target in the design of novel anti-cancer drugs. DTD is also expressed in normal tissues, but little is known about
its “body mapping”. Because of the dearth of information on the cell-specific expression of DTD in pigment-
producing cells of the skin, we analysed its expression in normal and tumoral samples. Twenty skin biopsies of
primary malignant melanotic melanomas (ten with vertical invasion, ten with superficial spreading) were analysed by
immunohistochemistry. In normal skin DTD expression was weak in all epidermal layers, including normal
melanocytes. Malignant melanomas showed a very strong DTD expression in tumoral cells of all samples and in
endothelial lining of peri-tumoral vessels.
These results suggest that DT-diaphorase may be a new marker that could be useful in determining the extent of
a malignant melanocytic lesion, and also tend to support the potential of malignant melanomas as target for DTD-
directed antitumour agents.

Introduction
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQ01, DT-diaphorase, DTD)
is a cytosolic enzyme that is known to catalyse a two-electron
reduction of many xenobiotics, including some that are carcinogens
[1-3] and some that are anti-neoplastic agents [4-6]. DT-diaphorase is
able not only to reduce exogenous and endogenous quinones, and
thereby to protect the cells against these reactive intermediates, but
also to activate some quinones with cytostatic properties [7].
Compounds such as mitomycin C, streptonigrin, MeDZQ, E09,
tirapazamine and RH1 are efficiently bioactivated by this enzyme
[8-14].
RH1 is a compound selected for clinical development by the Cancer
Research Campaign (CRC) and the NCI, and after its preclinical
evaluation [15], it successfully underwent phase 1 evaluation [16].
Cells with elevated DT-diaphorase levels are generally more
sensitive to bioreductive antitumour agents [10,17-19].
DT-diaphorase has been shown to be over-expressed in many
cancerous tissues as opposed to normal tissues [20]. High levels of
NQO1 gene expression are observed in liver, lung, colon and breast
tumors in contrast to normal tissues of the same origin [21].
This enzyme is also ubiquitously expressed; a wide variation in
NQO1 gene expression has been noted among various human tissues
[22]; its overexpression has been described in isolated normal cells, i.e.podocytes [23] and cells of human reproductive system (Leydig’s cells)
[24]; this observation 
may explain some quinones-related clinical
toxicities, such as infertility and kidney failure.
Analyses of RNA indicate levels of NQ01 gene expression in
tumours and in the tissue surrounding the tumours of patients with
carcinoma that are 20- to 50-times higher than in normal individuals
[25,26].
A dose correlation between DT-diaphorase expression explored by
immunological methods and enzyme activity has been demonstrated
[27,28]. Since DT-diaphorase plays a major role in activating quinone-
containing anti-tumour agents in human carcinoma celi lines, the
measurement of DT-diaphorase in clinical tumour samples is criticai
in designing adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy. Compounds that
can be bioactivated by DT-diaphorase are becoming of increasing
interest [12,15,29-32,]. Because of the heterogeneous nature of DT-
diaphorase expression, it is of primary interest to evaluate its
expression and distribution in human normal and cancerous tissues.
Surprisingly, DT-diaphorase has not been extensively investigated in
human malignant melanomas or more generally in pigment-
producing cells that are known to generate considerable amounts of
ortho-quinones [33]. Very little has been previously reported on the
level of expression of DT-diaphorase in human malignant melanomas
of the skin. By a spectrophotometric method, a previous study
detected high DT-diaphorase activity in melanoma cell cultures, in
comparison to melanocytes isolated from normal skin or pigmented
congenital naevus [33]. Another study analysed pathology specimens
of conjunctival melanomas and primary acquired melanosis for DT-
diaphorase expression by immunohistochemistry [34]. DT-diaphorase
was detected in every examined section of primary acquired melanosisZappa, et al., J Cytol Histol 2014, 5:5

conjunctiva 
(uniform staining). Interestingly, mitomycin C has been
used in the treatment of both acquired melanosis and melanomas of
the conjunctiva, suggesting that DT-diaphorase may play a role in the
bioactivation of mitomycin C in these tumours. In our study, we
performed an immunohistochemical analysis of DT-diaphorase
expression in human primary malignant melanotic melanomas of the
skin.
Materials and Methods
Human tissues
Archival samples of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were
supplied by the Institute of Pathology of Southern Switzerland,
Locarno, Switzerland.
We analysed
• Ten bioptic samples of superficial spreading human malignant
melanoma
• Ten bioptic samples of locally invasive human malignant
melanomas
Methods
We performed an immunohistochemical analysis for the detection
of DTD on tissue sections using anti-DTD antibodies.
Antibodies and Reagents
Anti-DTD monoclonal antibody (IgG1)-secreting hybridomas
(clones A180 and B 771) were derived from a BALB-c mouse
immunized with purified recombinant human DTD protein. All
hybridoma cell lines were grown in spinner flasks in RPMI medium
containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, 1% L-
glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% C0 2 at 37°C to a
concentration of 106 cells/ml. Hybridoma tissue culture supernatants
were prepared by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 10 min and then
stored at -80°C.
Prior to use supernatants were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5
minutes. We demonstrated specificity of our proprietary antibody by
pre-absorbing it with antigen (human recombinant DTD), and
showing that immunohistochemical staining was completely blocked.
We also performed a Western analysis on tissue extracts to confirm
immunohistochemical staining specificity. Non-human reactive
monoclonal mouse antibodies produced in tissue culture, subclass
lgG1, were used as negative control reagent (Mouse lgG1 Negative
Control Code No. X0931 DAKO A/S, Denmark).
Immunohistochemical method
Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections (3 µm)
cut from archival paraffin blocks. Sections were de-paraffinized in
xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohol to running water, then
placed in citrate buffer pH 6.0 and microwaved for two 3 min cycles.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by adding Peroxidase
Blocking Agent (DAKO En Vision Kit, Carpinteria, CA 93013 USA).
Non-specific binding was blocked by adding 20% normal rabbit
serum. Serial sections of each tissue sample were then incubated with
either anti-DTD or control antibodies for 30 minutes at room
temperature. The secondary antibody was added for 30 minutes(DAKOKIT, labelled Polymer HRP anti-mouse: peroxidase labelled
polymer 
conjugated to goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins).
Immunodetection was performed using a substrate-chromogen
solution (DAKOKIT, hydrogen peroxide and 3,3’-diaminobenzidine
chromogen). Slides were counterstained with haematoxylin,
dehydrated through graded alcohols, mounted and photographed.

intensity of immunostaining of DTD (brown staining) was
visually scored as 0 (negative), +1 (very weak), +2 (weak), +3 (strong),
+4 (very intense) as previously reported for human lung cancers [35].
Results
All samples analysed were suitable for immunohistochemical
analysis of DTD expression.

glands (Figure 3C-3D), and a strong to very strong staining (score
+3/+4) was seen in endothelial lining of dermal vessels (score +3/+4)
(Figure 3A). Interestingly, in one sample we did observe a well
circumscribed epidermal area of strong DTD expression (Figure 3B).
This could reflect a focal, protective response of the skin to external
noxious agents.There was no immunostaining in control sections when non-
specific antibodies were used (Figures 1B, 2B, and 3D).

Discussion
Malignant 
melanoma is a tumor of melanocytes, cells derived
embryologically from the neural crest. Most melanocytes are located in
the basal layer of the epidermis, and produce melanin pigment, which
is released into the epidermis and is responsible for skin colour. In
fair-skinned individuals, melanocytes are subjected to considerable
irradiation by visible and ultraviolet light. There is good
epidemiological evidence from case-control studies to implicate sun
exposure as a major causative factor for human melanoma [36]. The
increasing incidence of malignant melanoma and the sparse
availability of therapeutical resources implies the need to find new
strategies to optimize its diagnosis and treatment. The prognosis of
malignant melanoma is based on the stage of invasion at diagnosis,
and is therefore strictly dependent on the ability of the pathologist to
determine precisely the thickness of the melanoma (according to
Breslow) and the level of invasion of the dermis. Other histologicalCitation: Zappa F, Ward T, Pedrinis E, Mc Gown A, Thatcher N (2014) NAD(P)H:Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 Expression in Human Primary

ulceration 
and the number of mitosis, as well as the presence of
satellite metastasis and in-transit metastasis around the tumor. The
presence and the number of lymph nodes and of distant metastases are
also of high prognostic relevance. Immunohistochemistry is the most
valuable technique in diagnostic pathology. Many
immunohistochemical markers of melanocytic lesions are available,
some for diagnostic use, others with prognostic value. The most widely
used melanocytic immunohistochemical markers in melanoma
diagnosis on paraffin-embedded tissue blocks are the antigens S100
(antibody S100) [37,38], gp 100 (antibodies HMB-45 and NKI-beteb),
tyrosinase (antibody T311) and the melanoma antigen recognized by T
cells, MART-1 (antibody A103) [39-47]. These antibodies are relevant
not only for their histo-pathological diagnostic utility, but also with
respect to the development of new anti-tumoral immunotherapeutical
approaches and for screening potential candidates for these
immunotherapies [48-50]. It is known that peptides derived from the
antigens MART-1, tyrosinase and gp100 can generate immune
responses because they are presented to T-lymphocytes (cytolytic T-
cell-mediated immune response) [47,50,51]. In our study, a very
strong expression of DT-diaphorase was found in malignant
melanoma tumoral cells but not in normal skin. Interestingly,
endothelial lining of vessels also expressed high levels of DT-
diaphorase, revealing a potentially double cytotoxic action of DTD-
activated compounds, both on tumor cells and vessels. In fact, cells
with elevated DT-diaphorase levels are intrinsically more sensitive to
bioreductive antitumour agents such as Mitomicyn C, Streptonigrin or
RH1, because of activation of these prodrugs upon reduction by DT-
diaphorase. This reduction produces potent cytotoxic compounds that
cross-link DNA and cause cell death. Indeed it is the increased
expression of DT-diaphorase in tumor tissue that is used as a selective
target for the design of new anti-cancer drugs. These results validate
the interest in malignant melanomas as targets for DTD-activated
antitumour quinones and, in addition, propose that DT-diaphorase
may be a novel immunohistochemical marker for use in determining
the intra-epidermal and dermal extent of human malignant melanoma
of the skin. The specificity of this new potential marker in
distinguishing malignant melanocytic from benign melanocytic lesions
and in evaluating malignant melanoma metastasis needs to be further
evaluated.
