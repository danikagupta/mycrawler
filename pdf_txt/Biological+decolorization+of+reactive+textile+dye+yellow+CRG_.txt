1.  INTRODUCTION  
Textile industries discharge a huge amount of color ed waste water are, rated as the most 
polluted in all industry sector. There are 100,000 commercially available dyes ..Mullan et 
al., 2001). Annual global dye production reaches al most 7×10 7 tons. Azo dyes comprise 
about 70% of total dye production. In India, it acc ounts for the largest consumption of 
dyestuffs at ~80%, taking in every type of dye and pigment produced, this amounts to 
close to 80,000 tons (Mathur et al. 2003). India is  the second largest exporter of 
dyestuffs, after China. Worldwide, ~10 6 tons of synthetic dyes are produced annually, of 
which 1–1.5 × 10 5 tons are released into the environment in wastewat ers (Koyani et al 
2013).   
Dyes  extensively used in many industries e.g., var ious branches of textile industry, the 
leather tanning industry, paper production, pharmac euticals and medicines, cosmetics, 
hair coloring, wood staining, agriculture, biologic al, and chemical research, light 
harvesting  arrays, and photochemical cells (kuhad et al. 2004; Couto 2009).  Because 
imperfection of dyeing process, approximately 10-15% of synthetic dyes released into 
industrial waste, causing serious environmental pro blem (koyani et al. 2013; Singh et al. 
2013). Untreated coloured waste water may lead to c ontamination of surface water. The 
consequence is inhibition to penetration of sunligh t, which may result reduction of 
photosynthesis activity and oxygen deficiency (Vish wakarma et al. 2012). Synthetic 
origin of dyes and complex  aromatic structure caus e that many of them are toxic, 
mutagenic and carcinogenic, some dyes are resistanc e to biological degradation and may 
be accumulated in food chain (Forgas et al.2004; Ha mid and Rehman 2009; and Koyani 
et al. 2003).  
Textile dyes uses a large amount of dyes, consequen tly increase of their concentration in 
the environment and requires the development of new  and economically acceptable 
treatment technology. Various physiochemical and bi ological methods are used for 
treating waste water. Physiochemical methods (rever se osmosis, adsorption, flotation, 
precipitation, coagulation, ozonation, and chemical  oxidation (Tony et al.2009). 
Biological methods have been gaining much attention  due to their low cost and eco- Abstract  Online International Interdisciplinary Research Jou rnal, {Bi-Monthly}, ISSN 2249-9598, Volume-VII, Iss ue- II, Mar-Apr 2017 Issue

 Page 15 friendly nature. (Ali et al. 2010). In addition, it  would be cheaper as compared to other 
different physiochemical methods. The main mechanis m of both live and dead forms of 
cells in the treatment process is biodegradation, f ollowed by biosorption ( Fu and 
Viraraghavan 2001).    Biological methods include various types of micr obial biomass 
such as bacteria, fungi, actenomyctes  and algae (K aushik and Malik 2009; Gupta and 
Rastogi 2008). Various fungual strains that have pr oved more efficient in declourization 
of textile dyes mostly belonged to the group of fun gi by biosorption (Fu and 
Viraraghavan 2000) and enzymatic minerlization (deg radation) [ Lignin peroxidase, 
manganese peroxidas ( MnP), manganese independent p eroxidase (MiP), laccase] ( 
Pointing and Vrijmoed 2000; Vishwakarma et al. 2012 ). Several fungi, such as 
Asepergillus flavus (Ali et al. 2010), Aspergillus niger (Zope et al. 2007) , Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium( Arora and chader 2009 ) and Cyathus bulleri (wang et al.2012), has been 
reported as potential biodegraders of pollutend com pounds. It was proven that the 
efficiency of any type of textile waste water depen ds upon on the type of microorganism 
and the process condition. The most important facto rs are temperature, oxygen level, p H 
additional carbon and nitrogen sources as well as t he concentration of dye and chemical 
structures (Younes et al 2012).  
In the present work, we have investigated the poten tial of a fungus i.e. Aspergillus 
niger , for microbial declourization of waste water conta ining carpet dyes. The effect of 
dye concentration, time and PH of waste water were studied. 
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS  
2.1 Chemicals 
Waste water used in this study was collected from a  local carpet industry in Bhadohi near 
to Varanasi, India. Theses waste water was collecte d in a sterilized plastic container. 
2.2 Cultures and its maintenance 
The pure culture of Aspergillus niger was procured from Institute of Agricultural 
Science, BHU, Varanasi. Throughout the study, cultu res were maintained on malt extract 
agar medium at 28 0C and subculture at the regular interval of three w eeks. 
2.2 Preparation of inoculums 
The Aspergillus niger was grown in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask on optimized m edia (2.5% 
malt extract in distilled water). (Christian et al.  2003)The flasks were incubated in a 
shaker- incubator at 200 rpm and 27 ºC for 5 days and this fungal biomass were used as 
inoculums in the experiment. 
2.3 Biosorption of dyes 
All the experiments were performed to optimize conc entration of dye water at 5ml, 10 
ml, 20 ml 30 ml, 40 ml (Karthikeyan et al., 2009) w ith 1 ml inoculums concentration and 
agitation speed at 200 rpm in a triplicate manner. Media used throughout this study were 
malt extract containing media. Up to 50 ml of volum e maintained in all flasks.  
3. RESULTS AND DISSCUSSION 
In present study different physicochemical paramete rs of dye containing effluent were 
estimated and obtained data are given in table 1.  The physiochemical properties like 
temperature, pH, conductivity, TDS, TSS, TS, DO, CO D, Hardness and absorbance of 
the effluent waste water was estimated by standard method. Online International Interdisciplinary Research Jou rnal, {Bi-Monthly}, ISSN 2249-9598, Volume-VII, Iss ue- II, Mar-Apr 2017 Issue

3.1 Effect of ph on different concentration of dyes   
Media without dye water showed pH 6.59 in the begin ning of experiment, subsequently it 
decreased to 4.20 on 7 th  day of incubation. It was observed that pH decreas ed 
significantly in all concentrations of dye water. p H of 5 ml of dye water containing media 
was recorded 1.62 on 7 th  day of incubation whereas 10, 20,30 and 40 ml dye water 
containing media, pH recorded on 7 th  day were 1.40, 1.61,1.60 and 1.46 respectively. 
From obtained data during present study, it is clea r that, in the beginning of experiment, 
media was slight acidic but after continuous incuba tion pH get decreased significantly. 
Aspergillus produces citric acid, due to this media become acid ic. Aspergillus  biomass 
production was increasing on incubation period. On 7 th day of incubation culture medium 
appeared full of Aspergillus  mycelium, meant for more biomass and consequently more 
acid production and; main reason behind the lowerin g of pH of experimental media. 
which is clearly show in fig.1 
 
3.2 Effect of COD in different concentration of dye s 
In addition to dyes, many other molecules, i.e., ad ditives and surfactants are also present 
in the textile wastewater, which constitute up to 7 0% of the final dry weight. The removal 
of these molecules cannot be monitored by decoloriz ation of the effluent. The chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) is an important parameter to de termine the total oxidizable 
substances present in the waste water. 5 ml, 10 ml,  20, 30, and 40 ml of dye water 
containing media showed COD after 3 day of incubati on were 126.6, 68.8, 101.67, 200 
and 206 respectively, whereas after 5 days of incub ation 50, 26.6, 18.34, 90 and 85 
respectively. Finally when full growth of Aspergillus  occur COD value decreased to at its 
lowest level i.e. 16.67, 10, 11.67, 35 and 30 respe ctively. COD of 20 ml dye water 
containing flask recorded more than 88% decreased. 
 
3.3 Effect of % degradation rate on dye concentrati on  
Decolorization was monitored by scanning the absorb ance between 400 and 750 nm 
using PerkinElmer UV–Visible spectrophotometer and the maximum absorption of dye 
effluent recorded at 596 nm. Reductions in the abso rbance at 596 nm showed that 
decolorization have taken place. Dye concentrations  were calculated from the calibration 
curve of absorbance and 
 
The declourization percentage of dye effluent was c alculated as follows: 
                                                             C T - C0  
                             Decolorization (%) =                    X 100  
                                 C 0 
 
Where, C 0 refer to the absorbance of control, C t refer to the absorbance of sample, and t 
refer to the incubation time (h). 
 
In the preliminary phase of the current study, the ability of A. niger  to decolorize dye 
effluent of carpet industry belonging to several di fferent chemical structural groups was 
analyzed. It was easily analyzed that on subsequent  days of incubation absorbance get 
decreased, which is shown in fig n.3.Initially dyes  dissolved in water showed higher Online International Interdisciplinary Research Jou rnal, {Bi-Monthly}, ISSN 2249-9598, Volume-VII, Iss ue- II, Mar-Apr 2017 Issue

 Page 17 absorbance as A. niger grown in medium it started metabolize the dye compo unds and 
break into simpler forms consequently absorbance ge t decreased. After 7 th  day of 
incubation dye water appearance was almost colorles s. Increase of declourization 
percentage on subsequent day of incubation suggests  that dye declourization is increased 
with decrease in pH (Bakshi et al., 2006 and Akar e t al., 2009, Sarim et al., 2017). The 
decrease or increase in adsorption with pH maybe ex plained on the basis of aqua-
complex formation and its subsequent acid–base diss ociation at the solid–solution 
interface (Khare et al., 1987). In acidic medium, a  positive charge develops on the surface 
(oxides) of adsorbents which is suitable for adsorp tion of dye anions, which decreases 
with increase in pH, hence decreasing the binding o f anion dyes. On the other hand in 
alkaline medium the adsorbent surface becomes negat ively charged, hence is suitable for 
adsorption of dye cations. Hence the extent of abso rbance not only depends on pH but 
also on the acidic or basic character of dye to be adsorbed.  
4. CONCLUSION 
 
Decolorization is a challenging process to both the  textile industry and the wastewater 
treatment plants.The result of present study shows that Aspergillus niger  had led into 
higher levels of declourization and degradation pot ential for the removal of dye 
containing waste water. Under optimum condition it decolorized colored waste water up 
to 99.7%. The colored waste water is degradable und er aerobic conditions with a 
concerted effort of fungus isolated from an effluen t disposal site. Physiochemical 
parameters (pH, carbon source, dye concentration an d agitation) had a significant effect 
on dye declourization. Further, it can be suggested  that the potential of the fungus need to 
be demonstrated in its application for treatment of  dye bearing waste water using 
appropriate practice, through biotechnological appr oaches to color removal.
