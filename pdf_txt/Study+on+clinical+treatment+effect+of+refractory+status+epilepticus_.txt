INTRODUCTION 
The incidence of status epilepticus (SE) ranges from approxi -
mately 5 to 40 per 100,000, based on several population-based 
studies across the US [1,2], and the incidence of super-refractory 
status epilepticus (SRSE) is 0.7 per 100,000. The response to 
treatment, its evolution time and duration, and the need to use 
one or more antiseizure drugs define SE as refractory or super-re -
fractory. In 2015, the T ask Force of the International League 
Against Epilepsy defined SE as a prolonged seizure that exceeded 
the intrinsic termination mechanisms at a certain point in time 
from the onset of the seizure (t1) and persisted beyond a second Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency with serious consequences for neuronal tissues, therefore, it is considered the most 
serious manifestation of epilepsy. The response to treatment, its evolution time and duration, and the need to use one or more antisei -
zure drugs define SE as refractory or super-refractory. Ketamine has been used in SE management since the 90s when an article de -
scribing its use in treating SE was published. Since then, at least 24 publications have reported the use of ketamine for the treatment 
of SE in both adult and pediatric patients. This scoping review seeks to synthesize information on the use of drugs in super-refractory 
SE, specifically ketamine. Twenty articles were chosen for the final document construction. Few studies have investigated the use of 
ketamine in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE). Most of the information comes from 
retrospective case series studies, mostly with small sample sizes, and although the information is heterogeneous, it points to the effi -
cacy of ketamine as a third-line drug in RES and SRSE, in controlling seizures.

point in time (t2), the latter being the time at which cortical dam -
age occurs. It also defines refractory status epilepticus (RSE) as 
one that persists beyond t2 time point despite treatment with 
first- and second line antiseizure drugs. It also defines SRSE as an 
SE that persists for more than 24 hours after the addition of a 
third-line drug, generally an intravenous anesthetic [1]. 
These definitions and their determinant aspects have clinical 
and therapeutic implications and dimension the consequences of 
the status, which forces the implementation of treatment with a 
certain "aggressiveness" and is a quick start to try to limit neuronal 
damage and improve neurological and clinical results [2-4]. The 
incidence of refractory and SRSE is approximately 40% among pISSN 2005-0348 • eISSN 2508-1349

patients presenting with SE, depending on the cause, with mortal -
ity approaching 50% [5].  
Ketamine, a drug derived from phencyclidine, was synthesized 
in 1960 and reached peak popularity in the 1970s. In 1982 it was 
reported that it could have another possible mechanism of action 
by agonism of µ, δ, and ɣ opioid receptors [6]. Another possible 
mechanism of action is the inhibition of monoamine oxidase, 
which prolongs the half-lives of serotonin, dopamine, and norepi -
nephrine [ 7,8]. In a study published in 2011, a decrease in the 
production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha was found in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary 
surgery who received ketamine, which gives it certain anti-inflam -
matory properties [9]. Another study in 2015 observed that it 
caused a decrease in calcium concentration at the cytosolic level 
in cardiac myocytes, and thus counteracted its effect in states of 
hypoxia, ischemia, oxidative stress, and hypertrophic cardiomy -
opathy [10]. Ketamine occurs in two forms: the S isomer, which 
is three times more active than its opposite, the R-enantiomer. 
The most widely used pharmacological presentation is a racemic 
mixture of both molecular forms [11-13]. Despite its widespread 
use as an anesthetic during surgical procedures, it was not until 
the 1990s that an article was published showing its use in treating 
SE [14,15]. 
Glutamate receptors (pharmacological targets of ketamine) are 
classified into two types: metabotropic receptors (mGluRs), 
which promote the activation of second messengers via the activa -
tion of transmembrane G proteins, and ionotropic receptors, 
which are coupled to an ion channel and allow the entry of vari -
ous ions, mainly calcium [16,17] (Fig. 1 ). Ionotropic receptors 
are divided according to the affinity of their specific agonists; here, 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors belong to this family. 
Excitotoxicity is characterized by neuronal death induced by 
the excessive release of glutamate and overactivation of its recep -
tors [ 18]. This event is associated with various disease states of 
the central nervous system, including epilepsy, hypoxia, ischemia 
and trauma. This overstimulation increases intracellular calcium 
concentrations; promotes lipid peroxidation of the cytoplasmic 
membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria and causes 
cell death [19,20]. 
METHODS 
This scoping review seeks to synthesize available information 
from different domains of drug use in SRSE, specifically ketamine. 
No specific questions were raised and the definitions and vari -
ables used in different publications on the use of ketamine in SE 
were explored. Two researchers searched for articles using key -words in the PubMed, Embase, SciELO, Bireme, Latindex, and 
Google Scholar databases, and medRxiv was explored for gray lit -
erature. The words that were used to construct the search strategy 
were “status epilepticus,” “refractory,” and “ketamine. ” 
RESULTS 
A search of seven bibliographic databases identified 38 articles re -
lated to the terms of interest published between 1990 and 2022. 
Articles in English or Spanish were selected based on their titles or 
abstracts. After filtering by content and relevance, 20 articles were 
selected for the final document construction (Fig. 2 ). The ex -
traction results were synthesized and presented as a qualitative de -
scription of the information and synthesis in quantitative data ta -
bles. 
Pharmacokinetic profiles of ketamine 
T able 1  shows the main causes of SE, including head trauma, cere -
brovascular disease, infections, tumors, autoimmune disorders, 
and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The etiology of SE and 
SRSE is particular and suggests that both conditions are more 
likely to develop due to acute neurological damage associated 
with a persistent inflammatory state, but not specifically with the 
presence of epilepsy, an underlying pathology. 
T o initiate the pharmacological treatment of SE, it is crucial to 
understand the mechanism by which seizures become refractory. 
Fig. 1.  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors regulate, through 
a complex mechanism, calcium entry into the cell from the extra -
cellular compartment. The entry of this cation translates into cal -
cium-dependent intracellular excitability mediated by second and 
third messengers. Ketamine antagonizes NMDA receptors which 
are located at the medullary, thalamic, limbic, and cortical levels. 
Thanks to the multiplicity of NMDA receptors, ketamine interferes 
with the sensory afferent flow to the central nervous system's 
higher centers, affecting pain, emotional responses, and memory, 
which is why it is referred to as a "dissociative anesthetic." Ket -
amine also has some side effects on opioid receptors which helps 
propagate its analgesic effect, as well as in alpha- and beta-ad -
renergic receptors, which gives it some cardiovascular actions.

https://doi.org/10.18700/jnc.230003 2Luis Espinosa, et al.  • Ketamine for status epilepticusAlthough the molecular pathophysiology of SE is complex, it 
complies with some of the body's “laws of homeostasis. ” For ex -
ample, seizures are perpetuated by an imbalance between excit -
atory and inhibitory mechanisms in neuronal tissues [21]. γ-Ami -
nobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory and Glutamate 
is the main excitatory neurotransmitter that mediates excitation 
by stimulating the NMDA receptor [22,23].  
After several minutes of constant seizure activity, “receptor traf -
ficking” appears. This is a phenomenon in which GABA receptors 
decrease through a process of “internalization,” generating a re -
duction in GABAergic activity. The number of glutaminergic re -
ceptors on the cell surface increases due to “externalization” from 
the cytosol to the cell membrane, producing increased neuronal excitatory activity [24-27]. This is clinically reflected in rapidly 
progressive resistance to benzodiazepines [ 28]. In this scenario of 
impaired GABAergic activity and increased excitotoxicity, 
NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, become therapeu -
tically relevant because they have a pathophysiological substrate 
that favors their effectiveness (Fig. 3 ). 
Other events are believed to occur at the tissue and cellular lev -
els and contribute to the development of RSE and SRSE. Among 
these events, there may be mitochondrial failure or insufficiency 
[29] and activation of the inflammatory cascade [ 30,31], which 
make the blood-brain barrier vulnerable together [32,33]. In 
treating SE, the primary therapeutic objective is to rapidly control 
ictal activity to limit neuronal death mediated by excitotoxicity 
and reduce the systemic complications generated, with benzodi -
azepines considered the first-line treatment. Other anticonvul -
sants such as phenytoin, levetiracetam, and valproic acid are the 
most widely used second-line drugs [34,35]. 
Having explored the pathophysiological substrate for which a 
third-line drug with effects on neuronal excitatory activity, specifi -
cally on NMDA receptors, could play a leading role, it is time to 
study the potential role of ketamine. In a retrospective study pub -
lished in 1996 by Walker et al. [14], a case of SE was reported in 
which ketamine was used as an anticonvulsant drug, demonstrat -
ing a favorable therapeutic response, and no noteworthy adverse 
effects related to its use were reported. Since then, there have been 
20 publications on ketamine and SE: nine case reports, eight ret -
rospective case series two systematic reviews, and one observa -
tional (T able 2 ) [5,14,15,36-52]. 
Usefulness of ketamine in RSE 
In the analysis of the obtained information, two questions arose 
that motivated this investigation. Is ketamine useful in the treat -
ment of RSE? Although seizures at any given moment may have a 
certain degree of clinical subjectivity, the two parameters used in 
the publications to determine the effectiveness of ketamine in 
RSE were clinical and electroencephalographic cessation of epi -
leptiform activity. Between case reports and case series, there are 
265 patients. A systematic review conducted in 2014 [46] 
grouped 110 patients, and another conducted in 2018 grouped 
289 patients [5]. Of the 19 case studies, 12 (63%) achieved com -
plete seizure control, whereas in the remaining case studies, sei -
zure control was partial (31%) or absent (5%). 
T able 2  contains some information from the results of studies 
on using ketamine in RSE. Each publication details, for example, 
the route of drug administration (intravenous or oral), the admin -
istration or not of loading dose, and the response to treatment, 
which was classified into three categories: good response, refer -Identification Screening IncludedIdentification of new studies via databases and registers

seizure activity; partial response, referring both to patients in 
whom seizures recurred after administration of the drug and to 
groups of patients where seizures were controlled in some pa -
tients and not in others; and no response, referring to patients in 
whom ketamine treatment had no effect on the duration of 
treatment expressed in hours, days, and months, and adverse 
drug reactions [ 5]. 
In more than 70% of studies regarding seizures controlled 
with ketamine during the first 48 hours of treatment, it is evi -
dent that this drug is effective in treating seizure activity in the 
RES and that its therapeutic effect is achieved within a few 
hours [ 5]. Its effect appears to be related to early onset and is also likely to have a direct relationship with the administered 
dose, with reported doses being higher than 0.9 mg/kg/hr [ 45, 
50,51]. 
A negative aspect that limits the benefit of ketamine in this clin -
ical scenario is recurrence after its cessation. This recurrence ap -
pears in 10%–60% of cases in which seizures are successfully sup -
pressed [50,52]. The recurrence of seizures when withdrawing 
ketamine treatment depends on multiple factors that are difficult 
to associate with each other, including the etiology of RSE, co -
morbidities, severity of the convulsive condition, medications 
used concomitantly or previously, and disorders of the internal 
environment. This disparity makes it difficult to establish a causal 
relationship between these two events. 
•  What is the pharmacodynamic profile of ketamine in RSE? 
We will analyze the information found on the loading dose, 
maintenance dose, start time of the drug, duration of treat -
ment, and its therapeutic and adverse effects. 
In 70% of the studies, a loading dose of ketamine was adminis -
tered at a rate of 0.5 to 5 mg/kg. The intravenous infusion doses 
ranged from 0.05 to 10.5 mg/kg/hr, and for patients who received 
the drug enterally, the doses ranged from 50 to 250 mg twice a 
day. Ketamine treatment was administered between the first 24 
hours and 140 days after the diagnosis of RES. The duration of 
ketamine treatment ranged from 2 hours to 29 days. The electro -
encephalographic response to ketamine treatment, as determined 
by the burst-suppression phenomenon, was as rapid as 2 hours or 
as delayed as 28 days. 
Adverse effects of ketamine 
The reported adverse effects included transient arterial hyperten -
sion (one case), supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (two cases), 
cerebellar syndrome (one case), metabolic acidosis in co-adminis -
tration with midazolam (one case), and cardiovascular collapse 
associated with metabolic acidosis (two cases) [5]. However, the 
heterogeneity in pharmacodynamic information found when us -
ing ketamine as a third-line drug in RSE [5] constitutes an unfa -
vorable aspect in determining its therapeutic index and other as -
pects of its pharmacodynamics. Little information is available re -
garding the oral administration of the drug. Oral ketamine has 
been used to control chronic pain in patients with neuropathic 
pain, cancers of different types, trigeminal neuralgia, and phantom 
limbs, among other conditions. The analgesic effect is mainly 
based on NMDA receptor activity. Although the bioavailability of 
orally administered ketamine is only 16%, its major active metab -
olite, norketamine, retains its NMDA receptor-antagonistic prop -
erties and has less affinity for NMDA receptors.

dosage because the therapeutic range is extensive and ranges be -
tween 45 and 1,000 mg/day. However, in patients treated with en -
teral ketamine, its effectiveness in seizure control appears to be 
maintained, thus constituting an alternative in cases where the in -
travenous route cannot be used [ 13,41]. Regarding adverse ef -
fects, it is not easy to establish the association between these and 
ketamine. Is not a first- or second-line drug, once treatment with 
this NMDA antagonist is initiated, it is difficult to assign any ad -
verse reactions to ketamine in a critically ill, polymedicated pa -
tient with at least two centrally acting drugs. Additionally, the 
wide range of doses administered and treatment durations com -
plicate the establishment of the causality of a clinical condition 
with a particular drug. However, several publications have report -
ed sialorrhea, hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, cardiac arrhythmias, and 
metabolic acidosis related to ketamine use [37,39,45,53-55]. Al -
though this drug is popular because it does not have hemodynam -
ic depressant effects, this is probably due to the release of endoge -
nous catecholamines, which increase peripheral vascular resis -
tance and heart rate [56-58]. Paradoxically, some reports indicat -
ed that the effects of endogenous catecholamines on intracellular 
calcium currents could prolong cardiac action potential and have 
adverse inotropic effects [ 59-61]. In patients undergoing multi -
modal neurological monitoring, ketamine infusion did not gener -ate harmful changes in intracranial pressure, and it was possible to 
reduce vasopressor requirements [50]. 
This particularity of the cardiovascular system may correlate 
with the cardiovascular collapse observed in two cases where 
ketamine was used [ 5]. Metabolic acidosis, which has also been 
reported in the treatment of RSE, has no clear cause. Some hy -
potheses suggest that hydrochloric acid, a diluent of midazolam 
(the first-line drug), can cause hyperchloremia, and thus con -
tribute to acidosis, homeostatic imbalance, and cardiovascular 
collapse [5].  
DISCUSSION 
The main goals of RSE and SRSE treatment are to preserve corti -
cal function and reduce morbidity and mortality related to neuro -
nal damage caused by prolonged seizure activity. Cognitive, be -
havioral, and functional alterations have been reported at rates 
higher than 75% in patients with RSE and are clearly related to the 
duration of seizures [62,63]. Given the current knowledge about 
the biomolecular changes that occur in the neuronal membrane 
during prolonged seizures and the early onset of drug resistance to 
GABAergic drugs, there are clear reasons to consider the early ini -
tiation of ketamine treatment in RSE protocols [3-26,28-35, 
5 https://doi.org/10.18700/jnc.23000339,41,46]. 
The scant prominence of ketamine as a rescue treatment for 
RSE is attributable, in some way, to medical inexperience with the 
use of the drug in this context, the heterogeneity of the informa -
tion available regarding its pharmacodynamic profile and side ef -
fects, and the lack of studies that include ketamine within their 
protocols. Although in most studies ketamine was not used in the 
initial hours of ER and was only used after various anticonvul -
sants, it was effective in controlling seizures when administered, 
usually within the first 12 hours [5]. However, there is currently 
insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of ketamine as a 
first-line drug or as a monotherapy in the management of RSE 
and SRSE. 
It is reasonable to assume that there is fear and insecurity when 
using drugs with such disparate pharmacodynamic profiles. It is 
likely that, as has happened with other drugs, further studies will 
endorse its use, even more so in extreme clinical scenarios, such as 
supra-refractory status. For example, only after several years of in -
travenous lorazepam and diazepam could their toxicity be over -
come, finding that it was due to propylene glycol, the excipient 
used in their pharmacological presentation, rather than this toxici -
ty being inherent to these benzodiazepines. Accordingly, the sta -
tistical power of the studies we included was insufficient to relate 
the infusion of ketamine to a positive or negative impact on the 
mortality of these patients. 
Few studies of report type and case series with small sample siz -
es and low statistical power, have examined the use of ketamine in 
RSE and SRSE. Despite the limited available evidence, the rapid 
efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of RSE and SRSE has been 
documented. This fact, in addition to the molecular and patho -
physiological substrates that support the use of the drug, should 
encourage further research in this regard. One of the aspects to be 
clarified is the safety profile of ketamine and its pharmacological 
interactions with the other anticonvulsants used in RSE and 
SRSE treatment to elucidate the mechanisms of metabolic acido -
sis and other homeostatic alterations reported in the studies with 
ketamine and RSE. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The treatment of RSE and SRSE represents a therapeutic chal -
lenge because of their high mortality rates and poor neurological 
outcomes. Early initiation of anticonvulsant therapy and its effec -
tiveness are crucial aspects of patient prognosis. Several animal 
models have shown that, in persistent seizures, the cell membrane 
experiences a decrease in GABAergic receptors and an increase in the expression of excitatory receptors, including NMDA glutama -
tergic receptors. 
There are few studies on the use of ketamine in RSE and SRSE, 
and most of the information comes from case reports, case series, 
and retrospective studies, mostly with small or unique samples. 
Although the information is heterogeneous, it suggests that ket -
amine, used as a third-line drug for RSE and SRSE, is effective in 
controlling seizures. In this sense, it would be a drug with patho -
physiological endorsement for use since the current evidence is 
favorable, if limited. Despite this, the nature of adverse reactions 
reported with the use of ketamine varies, and its cardiovascular ef -
fects and changes in the internal environment seem to be predom -
inant. Given the methodological limitations of most publications 
in this regard, information on neurological outcomes measured 
using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (and modified Rankin scales in 
patients with SE and SRSE who received ketamine is heteroge -
neous and inconclusive. 
The lack of randomized prospective studies constitutes a signif -
icant limitation in recommending and including ketamine in the 
RSE and SRSE protocols. Additionally, based on the changes in 
the biochemistry of the neuronal membrane and its receptors that 
occur in RSE, the question arises as to whether anti-glutaminergic 
drugs should be started early or as third-line drugs for this pathol -
ogy. Despite these limitations, ketamine appears to have a promis -
ing outlook for RSE and SRSE.
