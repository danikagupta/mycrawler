The objective of this study is to obtain new laccase and enzyme source with remarkable dye removal 
potential. Thirty isolates of white rot fungi were screened for extracellular laccase -production using 2,2 -
azinobis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonate) (ABTS) assay as indicator. Among  these, Polyporus 
pseudobetulinus  strain WR77 exhibits  the highest laccase activity  and its  suitable  enzyme production 
medium contains;  1% (w/v) rice chaff,  0.5 g/L di -ammonium tartrate , and 0.01 g/L peptone as the carbon;  
inorgan ic and organic nitrogen sources;  respectively. The laccase was 60 -fold concentrated (by 
ammonium sulphate precipitation, Q-sepharose anion -exchange chromatography, and S uperdex G-75 
gel filtra tion chromatography ) and  gave the  specific activity of 617.12  U/mg. The  MW of  prepared 
enzyme is 75.2 kDa  under  SDS-PAGE  determination. Empirical analyzing results indicate that the 
optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme are around 40°C and  pH 4, respectively. Furthermore, this 
enzyme  can resist to wide  pH range ( 4.0-11.0) with more than 95%  maximum activity  remained . The 
enzyme’s  Km and Vmax, with ABTS substrate , were 447.93 M and 104.17 µmol/min/mg protein, 
respectively.  The prepar ed enzyme w as strongly inhibited by Hg2+ and Fe2+ but weakly (9.7%) stimulated 
by 10 mM Cu2+ ions. The strain WR77 show s good ability in decolorizing  many  synthetic dyes (200 mg/L 
initial concentration) ; Ambifix Blue H3R (98% in 8 days) , Ambifix Yellow H3R (24% in 10 days ) and 
Ambifix Red HE3B ( 50% in 18 days). The prepared  laccase alone (5 U/ml) could decolorize Ambifix Blue 
H3R by 65% within 15  min and Malachite Green by 80% within 24 h . It can be concluded that new 
enzyme and source with satisfactory dye removal po tential have been successfully achieved. Further 
studies should be attempted to e valuate  their feasibility in industrial use s.

INTRODUCTION  
 
Lignin is a  comp lex oxyphenyl propanoid polymer  found 
in all vascular plants including herbaceous species  where

sibility in  support ing and protecti ng the plants . Lignin 
polymer comprises a variety of monomers connected 
together by various C -C and C -O-C non -hydrolyzable 
bonds with an irregular arrangement of successive 
monomeric and inter -monomeric bonds  (Dean and 
Eriksson, 1992) , thus it can resist to hydrolytic attack. 
Nevertheless , it can still be degraded  by various 
microorganisms, in particular, the  white -rot  fungi .  These   780          Afr. J. Microbiol. Res.  
 
 
 
the fungi can produce several oxidative ligninolyt ic 
enzymes, in particular lignin peroxidase and laccase. In 
addition to lignin , it has been found that these enzymes 
have relatively low substrate specificity  and can also 
degrade wide range of pollutants, such as chlorinated 
aromatic compounds, heteroc yclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons,  synthetic high polymers and various dyes 
(Arora and Sharma , 2010).  
The d yes are extensi vely used in several industries  
including textile, paper, printing, leather -dyeing, cosmetic, 
pharmaceutical and food industries . Approximately  10-15% 
of used  dyes are released into environment after manu -
facturing processes  (Erkurt et al. , 2007 ). These dyes are 
not only toxic to humans, animals and various aquatic life 
forms, but they also inhibit sunlight penetration and 
reduce photosynthetic activities  of various ecosystems . 
Moreover, the exiting  dyes usually come  from synthetic 
origin and contribute to more complicate  molecular 
structures making  them difficult to biodegrade . Therefore, 
many attempts have been made to find out more dye 
removal  tools in order to overcome this pollutant residual 
problem . Decolorization of these dyes by physical or 
chemical methods, including adsorption, coagulation/  
flocculation, ion exchange, oxidation and electrochemical 
methods have been relatively successful b ut still have 
economic and methodological disadvantages  (Erkurt et 
al., 2007 ). Alternatively, the dye decolorization using 
microbial enzymes has received a great attention in 
recent years due to its efficient application s. Certain 
families of fungi have ty pically proved to be suitable tools 
for textile effluent and dye removal  treatments . Moreover, 
fungal mycelia can provide an addi tional advantage over 
single cell organisms in that they can solubilize their 
insoluble substrates by producing extracellular e nzymes 
(Kaushik and  Malik , 2009 ). 
White -rot fungi have been demonstrated to have the 
ability in decoloriz ing the synthetic dyes by their lignin 
peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase 
(lignolytic enzymes). Generally, the fungi usually  contain 
various  combination s of the above three lignol ytic 
enzyme types . Most of white rot fungal strains seem to 
produce laccase as main enzyme during the dye 
decolorization process . The laccases (EC 1.10.3.2, p-
diphenol: dioxygen oxidoreductase) are multi -copper 
oxidase s that catalyze oxidation reactions  in many  
phenoli c and organic substrates coupling  with reduction  
reactions that transfer  molecular oxygen to water  
(Murugesan et al., 2007 ; Thurston , 1994 ). 
To date, numerous fungal strains have been tested for 
the abilit y to decolorize and mineralize various dyes.  
Unfortunately, the majority of dyes are chemically stable 
and still resistant to microbiological attack. Therefore, 
expanding the microorganism spectrum s having alterna -
tive laccase a bilities and novel laccase i soforms with 
different physicochemical and catalytic properties for the 
dye decolorization is still necessary . In this study, we  
screened 30 white rot fungi strains for their abilities to  
secrete laccase   and   selected   one   which   contains   the  
 
 
 
enzyme  was purified, characterized , and evaluated for 
their decolorization capability against the synthetic dyes.  
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Chemicals  
 
2, 2-azinobis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonate) (ABTS), and 
Malachite green oxalate salt (MG) were purc hased from Sigma -
Aldrich (USA). Ambifix Blue H3R, Ambifix Yellow H3R, and Ambifix 
Red HE3B were purchased from Rachada Chemicals Co., Ltd . 
(Thailand). The reagents used in polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (PAGE) were obtained from Plusone Pharmacia 
Biotech (Sweden), except that low molecular weight calibration kit  
was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (UK). All other 
biochemical reagents and general chemicals used in the 
investigation were of analytical grade and used in received  from. 
 
 
Organisms  
 
All 30 strains of white rot fungi used in this study were obtained 
from th e culture collection of the Microbiology Department, Faculty 
of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Each fungus was 
grown on 2% (w/v) malt extract agar (2%  MEA) slants at 25 °C for 
about seven days and maintained at 4 °C until use. Each  stocked 
fungus was sub -cultured every two or three months.  
 
 
Enzyme assays  
 
Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) activity was measured at 30 °C using 1 mM 
ABTS as  a substrate. The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 880  µl of 
100 mM sodium  acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 100  µl of ABTS stock (fi nal 
concentration 1 mM), and  20 µl of appropri ately diluted crude 
enzyme. Then, the increased absorbance  of the mixture was moni -
tored at 420 nm (ε 420 = 36.0 /mM cm) using  a spectrophotometer  
(Murugesan et al., 2007). One changed unit was determined by  1 
mol of oxidized ABTS per minute.  
 
 
Protein amount determination  
 
Protein contents were determined by Bradford’s procedure as 
described by Bollag et al . (1996) . Briefly, Two-fold serial dilutions of 
the sample (50 µl) in deionized water were prepared in a 96 well 
flat-bottom plate along with the series of standard BSA solutions, 
and then 50 µl of Bradford’s reagent was added to each analyzed 
well, the plate was shaken on a round orbit plate shaker (Biosan, 
OS-10, Latvia) and read at 595 nm using an ELISA pl ate reader 
(Biotek Synergy HT, Biotek instrument, USA). The OD was 
calculate d for protein concentration via a standard curve  derived 
equation . Besides , during column chromatographic separations, the 
protein amounts of eluent were determined by  directly  monitoring at 
280 nm.  
 
 
Selection of laccase -producing st rains 
 
All 30 fungal strains were activated on 2% MEA for one week. The 
ABTS agar medium (Pointing , 1999) was used for the selection of 
laccase -producing strains. Each plate was inoculated with one aga r 
plug (8 mm diameter) from the edge of an actively growing test 
fungus and incubated for seven days at room temperature. Positive 
laccase producing strains were determined by appearance of green    
 
 
 
zones around the colonies. Widths of the green zone dire ctly 
relates  to the amount of extracellular laccase produced. Thus the 
strain having the widest green zone diameter (cm) / colony diameter 
(cm) ratio was selected.  
 
 
Identification of white rot fungi  
 
After obtaining the fungal strain s with highest laccase  production , 
the species  identification  was conducted using systematic 
morphological and molecular  marker  approaches. Morphological 
determination  bases  on both macroscopic and microscopic 
characters  whilst the molecular identification based on DNA 
sequence  similarity of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions 
within  rDNA.  These were achieved by data comparison  between  
the attended isolate s and  those obtained from  NCBI GenBank 
database. Genomic DNA was prepa red from fresh mycelial culture  
of the selec ted fungal isolate and extracted with 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), as described in Zhou et 
al. (1999). PCR amplification of the intern al transcribed spacer (ITS) 
was carried out  with a total volume of 35 µl comprised of approx. 
100 ng genomic DNA , 1 × PCR master Mix (Fermentas, Califonia, 
USA), and 100 nM of ITS1F  primer, and 500 nM ITS4 primer . The 
amplification was performed in a thermocycler with certain  PCR 
program.  The post PCR content s were purified using the 
NucleoSpin® (Macherey -Nagel Inc. , Easton, USA) and direct ly 
sequenced at both leading and lagging strands (using the ITSF1 
and ITS4 primers, respectively) commercially available (Macrogen, 
Seoul, Korea). The complete consensus sequence was then used 
in NCBI GenBank BLASTn search ing with default settings . Top 100 
highest sequence similarity  hits were  recorded and compared. 
Species annotation of the deposited ITS sequences in the GenBank 
database were taken on trust and taken  to convert into molecular 
operational t axonomic unit (MOTU) desig nated  the fungal isolate to 
be the  likely species in case  the % sequence similarity was high 
enough (>97%).  
 
 
The effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on laccase 
production  
 
The optimal carbon and nitrogen (organic and inorganic) sources 
for max imal laccase production were preliminarily evaluated using a 
sequential univariate approach as follows.  
 
 
Different carbon sources on laccase production  
 
The selected fungal strain was precultured on 2% MEA for one 
week and then l accase production was carr ied out at 25 °C for 20 
days on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm in 250  ml flasks containing 100 
ml of basal medium (LBM)  supplemented with  1% (w/v) of one of 
investigated carbon sources ( rice chaff, biogases, rice bran, rice 
straw and sawdust ). The initial pH of  the medium was adjusted to 
5.5. Every two days of cultivation, the mycelium was harvest ed from 
certain amount of culture  aliquot by  filtrati ng through Whatman no. 
1 filter paper and the filtrate was further used to determine  the 
laccase activity. The  carbon source giving  maximal laccase 
production was selected  and its efficacy was estimated under  0.5, 
1.0 and 2.0%  (w/v) concentrations using the same condition  as 
described above.  All experiments were done in triplicate and the 
results are express ed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).  
 
 
Different nitrogen sources on the laccase production  
 
In order to optimize the inorganic nitrogen source, the C 4HI2N2O6  in Pajareeya et al.         781  
 
 
 
ammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH 4)2PO 4) or ammonium the 
LBM formula was replaced by  one of these inorganic nitrogen 
sources [ammonium chloride (NH 4Cl), ammonium nitrate (NH 4NO 3), 
persulfate  (NH 4)2S2O8] at nitrogen concentration of 0.25, 0.5 and 
1.0 g/L. All remaining  procedure s were conducted as method 
previously described except that the inorganic nitrogen in LBM 
medium was  modified by supplementing  with optimal carbon source 
type and concentration . 
In organic nitrogen sources optimization, the yeast extract ingre -
dient in the LBM medium ( which now was adjusted to be optimal 
carbon and inorganic nitrogen sources) was replaced by 0.005, 
0.01, and 0.02 g/L of one of these ingredients ( peptone, urea, soy 
bean , and corn steep ). The  optimal organic nitrogen type and con -
centration were selected  for further experiment use . All exper iments 
were done in triplicate  and the results were expressed  as mean ± 
SD. 
 
 
Laccase purification  
 
Laccase was purified from the selected white rot fungal strain 
(WR77) grown in the LBM culture medium with optimal carbon and 
nitrogen sources for 12 days. The culture medium  was separated 
from mycelia by  centrifugation at 15,000 × g  for 30 min (Beckman 
Coulter, USA). The supernatant was then fractionated with 80% 
saturated ammonium sulphate . The precipitant  was harvested by 
centrifug ation and taken to  dialyz e (membrane molecular weight 
cut-off 3,500 Da) in 4°C deionized water . The crude protein  was 
loaded (10 ml at 50 mg protein/ ml) onto a Q -sepharose fast flow 
column (1.6 cm × 15 cm , previously equilibrated with 50 mM 
sodium acetate, pH 5.0 ). After that, t he column was washed with 50 
mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) until the A 280 reading was 
less than 0.02. Then, b ound protein was eluted with a linear salt 
gradient (0 -1.0 M NaCl) at 2.0 ml/min, and collect ed in each  10 ml 
fraction .  
The eluted fractions w ere assayed for laccase activity and the 
absorbance at A280 was recorded . Peak corresponding  fractions 
were pooled together and dialyzed against running buffer before 
being  loaded (5 ml at 10  mg protein/ ml) onto a Superdex  G-75 
column ( 1.6 cm  × 60 cm ) which was equilibrated  and consequently 
eluted with 0.1 M NaCl / 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0,  at a 
flow rate of 1 ml/min. Each 5 ml fraction  was collected and  assayed 
for laccase activity . Finally, the peak corresponding  fractions were 
pooled  together  and some may need to be concentrated by 
lyophilization before used .  
 
 
Determination of enzyme purity by native -PAGE, SDS -PAGE 
and laccase enzyme staining  
 
The enzyme from each purification step was analyzed for its native 
protein  pattern and purity accord ing to the method described by  
Bollag  et al. (1996). The n ative PAGE was carried out at  10 and 5% 
(w/v) acrylamide for separating and stacking gels, respectively, 
using  100 mM Tris -glycine (pH 8.3) as the electrode buffer . 
Electrophoresis was  run at a cons tant current of 20 mA per slab  at 
room temperature in a Mini -Gel Electrophoresis unit (Hoefer model 
miniVE, Pharmacia Biotech, UK) . After electrophoresis,  protein 
bands in the gel were visualized after Coomassie blue R -250 
(Sigma) staining  procedure and af ter native -PAGE resolution 
finished, the  laccase zymograms were visualized  by immersing the 
gel into sodium  acetate buffer (pH 5.0) contained 5 mM ABTS at 
room temperature.  
Discontinuous reducing 0.1% (w/v) SDS -PAGE was performed  
according to the procedur e described by  Laem mli (1970)  using 15% 
and 5% (w/v) acrylamide for  resolving and stacking gels, 
respectively. Electrophoresis was  run  at  a  constant  current   of  20   782          Afr. J. Microbiol. Res.  
 
 
 
mA per slab in a Mini -Gel Electrophoresis unit . Low molecular 
weight standards (5 g each) were co -resolved on each gel and 
used  to determine the (subunit) molecular weight of the prepared 
laccase enzyme.  
 
 
Laccase characterization  
 
Temperature optimum and temperature stability  
 
The effect of temperat ure on the laccase activity of the enriched 
laccase fraction (post -superdex -75) was determined by incubating 
the enriched l accase  fraction (1 mg/ ml) in 100 mM sodium acetate 
buffer (pH 5 .0) at various temperatures (4 -90°C at 10 °C intervals) 
for 30 min. The  thermostability of the l accase  was investigated by 
preincubating the enriched l accase  fraction at various temperatures 
(40-70°C in 10 °C intervals) in the same buffer for the indicated fixed  
time intervals (10 -120 min), cooling to 4 °C and then assaying the  
residual l accase activity as described in above . The control 
incubation was set at 100% activity and the activities of the samples 
from the different temperatures were expressed relative to that of 
the control (100% activity).  
 
 
pH optimum and pH stabilit y 
 
Incubating the enriched laccase fraction in buffers of broadly similar 
salinity  levels, but varying in pH from 2 -12, was used to assess the  
pretreatment pH stability and the pH optimum of the laccase. The 
buffers  used were (all 20 mM) glycine -HCl (pH 2 -4), sodium  acetate 
(pH 4 -6), potassium phosphate (pH 6 -8), Tris -HCl (pH 8 -10) and 
glycine -NaOH (pH  10-12). The enriched laccase  fraction was mixed 
(1 mg/ ml final concentration) in each of the  different pH -buffer 
compositions, plus the control (50  mM Tris -HCl (pH 7.0). For pH 
optimuma, the above laccase -buffer mixtures were left for 30 min at 
room temperature and then adjusted back to 50  mM Tris -HCl (pH 
7.0) and assayed for laccase activity as described in above . The 
control incubation was set at 100% activi ty and the activity of the 
samples from the different pH buffers were expressed relative to 
that of the control (100% activity). For the pH stability, the different 
pH buffer -enzyme mixtures were adju sted in substrate 
concentration  as described in above  for laccase  activity assay, and 
performed over 30 min. The activity of the enzyme in each pH was 
then related to that of the control, set to 100%.  
 
 
Various metal ions and reagents  
 
The effects of various metal ions on prepared laccase activity was 
studied b y incubating the enzyme in presence of each divalent 
metal ion (Ca2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ and Hg2+) or EDTA at the 
concentration of 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mM , respectively,  for 30 min 
(the correspon ding salts are shown in Table 3 ). Then the enzyme 
activ ity was tested as described in above  and expressed as r elative 
laccase activity (%)  corresponding to the reaction mixture  without  
additional metal ions  (set as 100% activity ). 
 
 
Enzyme kinetics  
 
The enzyme kinetic constants, for ABTS substrate, were assaye d at 
concentrations between 0.025 and 2.0 mM in 100 mM sodium  
acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The substrate oxidation rates were 
determined by measuring the absorbance increase at the 
respective wavelengths  and Michaelis constants  (Km and Vmax) were 
calculated fr om Lineweaver -Burk plots.   
 
 
 
Dye decolorization  
 
The selected fungal strain was precultured on 2% MEA for one  
week before decolorization of each Ambifix Blue H3R, Ambifix 
Yellow H3R, Ambifix Red HE3B and malachite green (MG) (added 
in liquid culture mediu m to make 200 mg/L of initial concentration ) 
was evaluated in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml 
medium . Flasks were inoculated with three plugs (6 mm diameter) 
of pregrown mycelium and were incubated at 25°C for twenty days 
on rotary shaker  (120 r pm). Each sample was  separately  taken and 
the absorbance of the residual dye was followed by measuring the 
absorbance at 585 nm for Ambifix Blue H3R, 415 nm for Ambifix 
Yellow H3R, 535 nm for Ambifix Red HE3B and 620 nm for MG. 
The dye removal efficiency w as expressed as the percentage of 
remained dye per initial dye . 
To evaluate enzyme decolorization, the reaction mixture s (200 L) 
containing the crude enzyme (final laccase activity 5 U/ ml) and 
each dye (100 mg /L Ambifix Blue H3R, Ambifix Yellow H 3R, 
Ambif ix Red HE3B or MG) was  tested in 50 mM sodium acetate 
buffer, pH 5.0. Changes in absorbance were detected  by the  
spectrophotometer (Synergy HT Biotek, USA).  
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
Selection of laccase -producing st rains and fungus 
identification  
 
To sele ct the best laccase -producing strain from total 30 
strain white rot fungi, each strain was cultured on ABTS -
agar medium seven days before  the green zone around 
the colony were recognized and measured . Presence of 
laccase activity causes the clear medium tu rn green due 
to the ABTS is oxidized to be ABTS -azine (Niku -Paavola 
et al. , 1990). The green zone  width  to colony diameter 
ratio was used in laccase activity comparison . Although 
all 30 isolates  were found to secrete laccase, the isolate  
WR77 showed the hi ghest ratio (Table 1), and therefore it 
was selected for further study.  
For morphological identification, the b asidocarp of the 
isolate WR77 is 7-9 cm  broad and  0.5-1.0 cm thick, 
pileate to substipitate contain  a thin cuticle on the pileus  
which is  shell-shaped and bulgy. There is no stipe 
observed from f ruiting bodies  which  are shelf -like, fir mly 
attach to the bark,  upper surface  is cream -white  color . 
Dimitic hyphal system with arboriform vegetative hyphae,  
no reaction to Melzer’s Reagent ( nonamyloid ) is 
observed in cell content or wall . For genotypic identi -
fication, the ITS region of isolate WR77 was amplified, 
direct ly sequenced and compared to those in the NCBI 
GenBank database using the BLASTn algorithm. The 
PCR amplicon containing the its sequence of the isolate 
WR77 is 532 bp lon g and exhibited  highest  sequence 
identity (86 %) to Polyporus pseudobetulinus . Thus, both 
the morphological, cultural and molecular characteristics 
are consistent with isolate WR77 belonging to Polyporus 
and being related to P. pseudobetulinus . Some members 
of the genus Polyporus  have previously been reported to 
produce extracellular laccase production, such as P. 
anceps  (Petroski et al ., 1980) , P. anisoporus  
(Vaitkyavichyus et al ., 1984) and P. pinsitus   (Heinzkill  et   Pajare eya et al.         783

Carbon and nitrogen sources determination and 
optimization  
 
Carbon source  
 
Evaluation for the different carbon source effects in the 
LBM, in term of extrace llular laccase production , revealed 
that the maximum laccase activity (approx. 0.40 U/ ml) 
was obtained after a 16 -day cultivation period with rice 
bran as the carbon source ( Figure  1A). However, only a 
slightly lower laccase level (approx. 0.37 U/ ml) was 
obtained after a 12 -day cultivation period with rice chaff 
as the carbon source . The laccase production with rice 
straw as the carbon source was much slower than previous two sources and only reached 0.22 U/ ml after 
20 days cultivation.  In contrast, s ugarca ne bagasse and  
sawdust gave  the lowest laccase levels ( Figure 1A).  
The laccase production rate in rice bran carbon source 
treatment was slower than rice chaff  treatment. This  
could be due to presence of other enzyme secreting 
contributes to hydrolyze the r ice bran components (e.g. 
cellulases, -glucosidases and xylanases)  at the early 
stages of growth. Since, r ice bran contains high total 
carbohydrate level (~82% (w/w)) of which the main 
compo sition  (31%) is hemicellulose (Claye et al. , 1996) , 
the arabinoxy lan main ly composes of  xylose and 
arabinose (Mod et al. , 1978) . Although  rice chaff main 
components are hemicelluloses, but its lignin  proportion 
(21-26%) is still high (Yang et al. , 2004)  thus it could 
induce  laccase synthesis . This observation  agrees to a 
report in grape   seeds  which  have   relatively   high  lignin   784          Afr. J. Microbiol. Res.  
 
 
 
content and become the best solid carbon source for 
laccase production by Trametes hirsuta  (Moldes et al. , 
2003). From this result, the rice chaff was selected as 
carbon source since the laccase activity was comparable 
to that from the rice bran, but the rice chaff is  cheap er 
and generally available . 
It was found that i ncreasing of the rice chaff 
concentration from 0.5 to 1 or 2% (w/v) significantly 
increased the laccase production level, for example after 
12 days culture from 0.21 U/ ml to 0.37 and 0.32 U/ ml, 
respectively ( Figure  1B). Thus, the optimum 
concentration of the rice chaff was 1% (w/v). Increasing 
the rice chaff to 2% (w/v) might cause carbon a nd 
nitrogen excess , which directly affect  (reduce ) the 
ligninolytic enzyme production. Many agricultural wastes 
have been investigated for use as substrates in laccase 
production through  white rot fungi. Stajic et al. (2006) 
reported that the highest level  of laccase activity in 
Pleurotus eryngii was found in submerged culture with 
dry ground mandarine peels as the carbon source after 
seven days cultivation (999.5 U/L) , but the highest  level 
of laccase activity in Pleurotus ostreatus strain No. 493 
was obse rved under solid state fermentation  (SSF) 
conditions of grapevine sawdust after 10 days cultivation 
(2144.6 ± 57.8 U/L).  
 
 
Nitrogen source  
 
It was found from the i nvestigation of different inorganic 
nitrogen source and  concentrations (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 
g/L) that  the 0.5 g/L di -ammonium tartrate gave maximum 
laccase production (0.37 U/ ml), and thus was the best 
concentration  (Figure  1C). Indeed, most of given  
inorganic nitrogen sources gave respective optimal  
laccase production s at 0.5 g/L and the laccase p roduction 
decreased  at thereafter  range .  
Likewise, the different organic nitrogen sources 
typically gave their optimal laccase production at 0.01g/L 
and the production became diminished  at higher (0.02 
g/L) or lower (0.005 g/L) concentrations.  The overall  
maximum laccase production  (approx. 0.39 U/ ml) was 
obtained with 0.01 g/L peptone as the organic nitrogen 
source (Figure 1D). It was reported that, the peptone 
could stimulate laccase production in Lentinus edodes 
(Buswell et al., 1995 ), and  Phanerochaete  chrysosporium  
(Srinivasan et al ., 1995 ). However, Stajic et al. (2006 ) 
found that both P. eryngii and P. ostreatus strain no. 
493,gave  the highest laccase production  at 20 and 30 
mM (NH 4)2SO 4, respec tively . 
 
 
Laccase enrichment  capability   
 
The condition consisted of all optimized parameters were 
used for laccase enrichment. After an initial 80% 
saturation ammonium  sulphate  cut,   with   96%   protein   
 
 
 
removed and giving a 6.5 -fold laccase activity enhance -
ment  (Table 2 ), the culture supernatant was collected,  
dialyzed , and subjected to Q -sepharose anion -exchange 
chromatography ( Figure  2A). The laccase eluted at very 
low NaCl gradient (60 -200 mM) appeared  as a well 
separated sharp peak . A 27.2-fold decrease d with  three -
fold total laccase activity  loss while  approximately  nine-
fold specific activity  increase d (Table 2). The peak from 
Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography  is shown in 
Figure  2B. This step removes  contaminating protein from 
the laccase and makes the  total activity risen up to 60.1-
fold with a yield of 3.61% and a specific activity of 617.1 
U/mg. The final specific activity obtained here is fairly 
high compared to that reported in some other fungal 
laccases, e.g. 32.9 U/mg for Pycnoporus sanguineus 
(SCC 108) (Litthauer , 2007), and 50.5 U /mg for Daedalea 
quercina  (Baldrian , 2004) . 
 
 
Purity checking by native -and reducing SDS -PAGE 
and native zymograms   
 
The laccase from each step of enrichment was analyzed 
for purity and protein pattern by native -PAGE, with 
protein and enzyme activity stain ing ( Figure  3A). Whilst  
the post -DEAE -cellulose laccase fraction still showed  
multiple components, the enriched laccase fraction (post -
Superdex -75 laccase fraction) showed a single protein  
band on native -PAGE, suggesting a high degree of purity, 
with only a enzyme  band seen when using ABTS as the 
substrate, and at the same position ( Rf), supporting that  
the enriched laccase fraction was  a pure or near pure 
enzyme.  
For the prepared laccase, a  single band equivalent to  
the molecular weight of 75.2 kDa was ob served from 
SDS-PAGE electrogram  while the l accase a ctivity 
staining result revealed a single laccase activity zone  
corresponding to the band  position found in  the SDS-
PAGE electrogram  (Figure  3B). The molecular mass of 
this laccase is consistent to those reported in other fungal  
laccases, which are between 60 and 80 kDa (Mayer and 
Staples, 2002; Thurston, 1994).  
  
 
Laccase characterization  
 
Effect of temperature on laccase activity and 
thermostability  
 
The effect of temperature on the activity of the enric hed 
laccase is shown in Figure  3A. The optimum temperature 
of the purified enzyme was observed at 40°C, which is 
similar to that reported for the laccase from Lentinula 
edodes  Lcc1 (Nagai et al. , 2002), although the laccase 
was almost equally active over a  wide range of 
temperatures from 0 to 40°C and declined thereafter  
slightly at 50°C and significantly above 60°C to being 
completely inactivated ay 80°C. This is in contrast to   that  Pajareeya et al.         785

the optimum temperature of most fungal laccases is 
usually between 50 and 70°C (Baldrian , 2006 ). However, 
a few enzymes with an optimal activity below 50°C have 
been described before, such as the laccase from G. 
lucidum  at 25°C (Ko et al. , 2001).  The thermal stability of the prepared laccase from 
WR77 was determined by allowing the enzyme -substrate  
reactions took place in different temperatures with  
incubation time fixing. The result is shown in Figure 4B.

detectable loss of activity after 120 min. However, at 
50°C , the enzyme lost activity from 30 min onwards, 
whilst at 60 and 70°C, the enzyme activity rapidly 
declined in 120 and 45 min respectively. This thermal 
stability is in line with other fungal laccases that have 
been reported , such as Marasmius quercophilus  strain 17

was still high over pH 4 -11 range . Decreasing of the  
activity  (pH 3 and 2 ) was occurred  in the same buffer as 
the high laccase activity seen (pH 4), thus it was  unlikely 
to be buffer effect but true pH effect. The same argument 
could be hold for the activity declination  at pH 12. Similar 
broad  optimal  pH has been reported for la ccases from 
several fungi, such as Lentinula edodes  Lcc1 (Nagai et 
al., 2002). Fungal laccases typically exhibit optimal pH in 
the acidic range, whereas the  optimal  pH for ABTS 
oxidation are generally lower than 4.0 (Baldrian , 2004). 
From the result, the l accase activity had stayed high at 
4.0-11.0 pH range. The broad pH stability of WR77 could 
be a very useful characteristic for various industrial 
applications.  
 
 
Effect of metals and reagents  
 
The effects of various ions on the laccase activity are  
shown i n Table 3. The purified enzyme was strongly 
inhibited by Hg2+ and Fe2+ in a dose -dependent manner 
reaching as high as 97 -98% inhibition at 5.0 mM in both 
cases. The enzyme was also moderately inhibited by 10 
mM Zn2+ (77.8% of control activity), whereas EDT A 
showed no significant inhibitory effect. Cu2+ ions at 10 
mM showed a weak stimulation of the laccase activity 
(9.7%).  Baldrian and Gabriel (2002) reported the highly 
negative effect of Hg2+ at more than 0.1 mM on the stability of a purified laccase from the white -rot fungus 
Pleurotus  ostreatus , but the activity increase in the 
presence of 0.05 -50.0 mM Cu+2. Baldrian  (2004) found 
that laccase from the white -rot fungus Daedalea quercina  
was inhibited by 1 mM Mn (9% of control activity) and 10 
mM Hg2+ (7% of  control activity), whereas 1 mM EDTA 
exhibited only a slight inhibitory effect (90% of control 
activity). The addition of 10 mM Cu2+ increased the 
enzyme activity by 17%. In addition, Nagai et al. (2002) 
reported that a purified laccase from Lentinula edo des 
was inhibited by 55%  in the presence of 1 mM Hg2+, and  
it was activated by 40% in the presence of 10 mM Cu2+. 
Couto et al. (2005)  claimed that the effect of metal ions 
on laccase activity depended on laccase sources. Metal 
ions can also influence other  factors that affect 
biodegradation, thus the activation or inhibition of 
proteolytic enzymes by metals can also change the 
turnover rate of extracellular enzymes  (Palmieri et al ., 
2001) . 
 
 
Determination of kinetic parameters  
 
The prepared laccase from WR7 7 showed different 
kinetic behaviors depending on the substrate concen -
trations. From the Lineweaver -Burk plot (Figure 6), the Km 
and Vmax values were of 447.93 M and 104.17 
mmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The Km  value  of  this

WR77 laccase is relatively low compared to the reported 
values of 38, 108, 130 and  207 M from  Daedalea 
quercina  (Baldrian , 2004), Lentinula edodes Lcc1 (Nagai 
et al. , 2002), Pycnoporous sanguineus  (SCC 108) 
(Litthauer et al. , 2007) and Phellinus ribis  (Min et al ., 
2001) , respectively. Therefore, the  laccase from WR77 
possesses low Km and thus high substrate affinity  it is. 
 
 
Dye decolorization  
 
The white rot fungus WR77 showed  good decolorizing 
results to  Ambifix Blue H3R (approximately  98% removal within 8 days ) (Figure  7A) contrast ing to the  Ambifix 
Yellow H3R and Ambifix Red HE3B (very sl owly 
processed, reached 24% removal at 10 days) or Ambifix 
Red HE3B (reached 50% at 18 days). This could be due 
to either enzyme inhibition  (by some products generated 
in the decolorization process ) or substrate inhibition 
(Johann et al. , 2007 ). Moreover, the crude laccase (5 
U/ml) exhibited  good ability in decolorizing the  Ambifix 
Blue H3R and MG (Figures  7B and 7C), attaining 65% 
within 15  min and 80% within 24 h, respectively. 
However, the Ambifix Yellow H3R and Ambifix Red HE3B  
were not decolorized by t he crude prepared enzyme  
(data not show n), which is probably due to the complexity

Thus, the white rot fungus WR77 was better in  
decolorizing the Ambifix Yellow H3R  and Ambifix Red 
HE3B  while the crude enzyme couldn’t decolorize both of 
these two dyes. It is possible that this cause by 
biosorption effect of the fungal mycelia. Moreover, intact 
fungal mycelia can also possibly provide more suitable 
conditions than in vitro environments (e.g. presences of some cations, coenzymes, high energy substance 
supplementations, and even other enzymes that have 
ability to enhance the degrading reaction) . Along these 
lines, Swamy and Ramsay (1999) suggested that 
mycelium -associate d activities play an important role in 
the dye decolorization in Trametes versicolor . It has also 
been shown that the decolorization of an astrazone dye

(Cing and Yesilada , 2004).   
Svobodova et al.  (2008) demonstrated that I. lacteus  
cultivated in a liquid medium could fade out  88.5 and 98.6% 
of azo dyes RO16 and RBBR  within 24 h, respectively , 
whereas, in contrast,  no dye decolorization was detecte d by 
the crude culture filtrate. This  indicated  that the dye 
decolorization observed in complete fungal cultures may not 
occur when the secreted enzyme is used alone.  However, 
the crude enzyme from WR77 showed good ability to 
decolorize the MG, but not by the fungal cultures (Figure 6A).  
Perhaps, most of the fungi cannot tolerate in initially high 
MG concentration owing to its toxicity (Cha et al., 2001 ). 
Compared  with laccases from other fungi;  including  
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  (Chagas and Durrant , 2001) , 
Cunninghamella elegans  (Cha et al . 2001 ), and Coriolus 
versicolor  (Levin et al. , 2004 ); the MG decolorization 
efficiency of the crude laccase from WR77 w as very high, 
with about 160 mg/ L MG removal  within 1 h at 30 °C and pH 
5.0. Thus, the white  rot fungus  WR77 showed a high laccase 
produc tion ability  and dye decolorization . This new 
discovered laccase can be  a good candidate for industrial 
application . 
 
 
Conclusions  
 
The isolate WR77  of white rot fungi exhibits very close 
relation to or being a member of Polyporous 
pseudobetulinus . Among a ll 30 isolates, this one  exhibits  
highest laccase production. By univariate analysis, it was 
found that the 1% (w/v ) rice chaff, 0.5 g/L di -ammonium 
tartrate , and 0.01 g/L peptone  are the optimal carbon, 
inorganic , and organic nitrogen composition for lacc ase 
production , respectively . In sequential purification with  
ammonium sulphate precipitation, Q-sepharose anion -
exchange chromatography , and S uperdex G -75 gel 
filtration  chromatography;  it was found that laccase was 
concentrated with the specific activity  of 617.12  U/mg . 
The enzyme has molecular mass approximately 75.2 kDa , 
stable at pH 4 -11 range with the optimum pH and 
temperature of 4 and 40 °C, respectively.  The enzyme 
possesses  relatively high S substrate affinity . Its activity is 
strongly inhibited by Hg2+ and Fe2+ ions whereas weakly 
stimulated by 10 mM Cu2+ ions. Moreover, WR77 showed 
good ability in synthetic dyes  (Ambifix Blue H3R, Ambifix 
Yellow H3R and Ambifix Red HE3B ) decolorization  which 
can reduc e the dyes from 200 mg/l  by 98% in 8 days,     
24% in 10 days  and 50% in 18 days, respectively. The 
crude laccase (5 U/ ml) can decolorize Ambifix Blue H3R 
by 65% within 15  min and Malachite Green by 80% within 
24 h. Thus, new laccase has been successfully identified 
and, from this study, it has good poten tial in applying to 
decolorize  dyes in industrial waste water. Further studies 
are still needed for extending this enzyme to other 
applications such as other pollu tant eradication s and 
paper bleach ing. Pajareeya et al.         79 1
