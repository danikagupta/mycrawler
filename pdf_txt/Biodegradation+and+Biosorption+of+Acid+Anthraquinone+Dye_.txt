 Abstract 15 
The current study describes the aerobic b iodegradation of Indanthrene Blue RS dye by a microbial consortium 16 
immobilized on corn-cob biochar in a continuous up-flow packed bed bioreactor. The adsorption experiments 17 
were performed without microbes to monitor the adsorption effects on initial d ye decolorization efficiency. The 18 
batch experiments were carried out to estimate the process parameters, and the optimal values of pH, temperature, 19 
and inoculum volume were identified to be 10.0, 30 ºC, and 3.0 × 106 CFU mL-1, respectively. During the 20 
continuous operation, the effect of flow rate, initial substrate concentration, inlet loading rate of Indanthrene Blue 21 
RS on the elimination capacity, and its removal efficiency in the biorea ctor was studied. The continuous up-flow 22 
packed bed bioreactor was performed at different flow rates (0.25 to 1 .25 L h-1) under the optimal parameters . 23 
The maximum removal efficiency of 90% was observed, with the loading rate varying between 100 to 300 mg L-24 
1 d-1. The up-flow packed bed bioreactor used for this study was extre mely useful in eliminating Indanthrene Blue 25 
RS dye using both the biosorption and biodegradation process.  Ther efore, it is a potential treatment strategy for 26 
detoxifying textile wastewater containing anthraquinone based dyes. 27

 1. Introduction 30 
Rapid urbanization increases the demand for fast industrialization, thereby causi ng problems for the environment. 31 
The release of immense amounts of wastewater from the industrial sector , decrease the freshwater availability [1,2], 32 
thus leading to pollution issues worldwide if not appropriately treated. In dustries such as textile, printing, tannery, 33 
paint, plastic, cosmetics enormously used synthetic dyes because of their intense and solid colors. O’Neill et al. 34 
1999 stated the recognizable amount of colors in water to be higher than 1 mg L-1 [3]. Generally, 100.000 synthetic 35 
dyes and dyestuffs are utilized by dyeing industries [4], and nearly 10-15% of the unfixed dyes are released to the 36 
water stream directly without being treated. The entry of untreated textile efflu ents into the water bodies alter the 37 
pH, BOD, COD, as well as reduce the sunlight penetration [5] and thereby disturb the biodiversity of that system. 38 
Based on the classification of dyes, their disposal into the water stream ranges f rom 2% (basic dyes) to 50% 39 
(reactive dyes) of the initial dye concentration [3,6].  Among these reactive dyes, azo and anthraquinone dyes 40 
represent a significant group of synthetic dyes [7]. Their complex structure makes them highly toxic and resist s 41 
degradation [8,9]. Anthraquinone dyes are among the major groups of colored p ollutants highly resistant to 42 
degradation due to the presence of the fused aromatic rings, which help them to remain colored for a longer time 43 
[10,11,12]. They represent about 15% of total dyes are water-insoluble due to the exis tence of the chromophoric 44 
group designed by the conjugation of C=O and C=C [13,14]. Among the anthraquinone dyes, “Indanthrene Blue 45 
RS,” are commonly used for cotton and silk dyeing, is primarily ob served in the wastewater of textile industries. 46 
Variou s physicochemical methodologies such as adsorption, oxidation, coagulation, p recipitation, and membrane 47 
filtration [15] employed for decolorization of textile effluents are cost-intensive, less  efficient and result in the 48 
production of large aggregates of secondary pollutants [16,17]. Therefore, there is a burgeoning demand to establish 49 
cost-effective methods to decolorize these polluting dyes. Biological proces ses using bacteria, algae, yeast, and 50 
fungi are excellent alternative methods as compared to physicochemical methods in decolorizing the textile 51 
effluents. They have less operational cost, are eco-friendly, and under  optimal operating conditions produce less 52 
sludge compared to other methodologies [18,19]. This biodegradation process has turned out to be a promising 53 
method as it completely decolorizes the dye and transforms them into a non-to xic chemical form [20,21]. Under 54 
optimized, aerobic or anaerobic conditions using microorganisms, a sign ificantly high percentage of 55 
decolorization and degradation of dyes can be achieved [22,23,24].  56 
The bioremediation of textile wastewaters is continuously expanding within the area of environmental 57 
biotechnology as it is fast and efficient. Pure bacterial strains generally are incap able of degrading the dyes 58 5 
 completely, producing carcinogenic aromatic amines as intermediates, which fur ther needs to be decomposed [25]. 59 
It’s crucial to scale up and maintain large scale pure cultures for wastew ater treatment systems [26]. In the recent 60 
past, many consortiums having enhanced degradation abilities have been studied . The microbial consortium has 61 
been used over pure cultures for dye  degradation as it possesses a high degree of mineralization and biodegradation  62 
[7] due to the synergistic interaction in the metabolism of the bacterial communit y. In a consortium, the bacterial 63 
strains metabolize the molecular structure of dye by attacking at various positions  of the aromatic rings or by 64 
using metabolites formed by the dominant strains to degrade furth er [27,28]. Nowadays, trials on bacterial-bacterial 65 
synergism are being utilized to develop new environmentally-friendl y abatement technologies to degrade the 66 
textile dye wastes without producing toxic metabolites. 67 
Bioreactors are the basis of all biotransformation processes, such as the production of vaccines, en zymes, 68 
nutrients, etc., as well as biodegradation activities [29]. Various biodegradation assays of dye were performed 69 
using reactors in batch mode, but continuous reactors are recognized as being more efficient and appropriate for 70 
real-time applications [30]. Simultaneous processes of biosorption and biodegradation (BB) were estab lished to 71 
remove high concentration dyes, involving adsorption followed by b iological treatment.  Using this advanced 72 
treatment strategy effectively removes the contaminants that will be co nverted into harmless compounds in the 73 
bioremediation process.  The BB process is an economically feasible, highly effective, and  environmentally 74 
friendly process, and thus has advantages in practical applications compared  to other conventional techniqu es 75 
[31]. The efficiency of a continuous reactor can be increased under optimal con ditions by using packing materials 76 
[32,33]. A continuous method for the treatment of effluent needs to be developed by taking into consideration the 77 
large-scale elimination of anthraquinone dyes, mainly from the textile indus try into the waterways. Continuous 78 
mode bioreactor operations for the effluent degradation under aerobic cond itions require immobilized biofilms 79 
suspended to biological systems. Biofilms can be developed by encapsulatin g the microorganisms into the 80 
packing material, which supports growth. This immobilization system has been reported to be better than the 81 
free cell system as it offers a high loading rate as well as inhibits biomass  washout. The other advantages of 82 
using this technology include higher stability, reduced land usage, low er operational cost, and recycling of waste 83 
[34]. Therefore, it is difficult to find efficient treatment technologies for th e dyeing industries that can meet the 84 
environmental sustainability requirement. Immobilized cell technology has now b ecome an accepted method for 85 
treating dye wastewaters and thereby have achieved increasing attention. Studies on dye biodegradation have 86 
been reported to be mostly done in batch reactors. 87 
Moreover, continuous reactors are effective and appropriate for real-tim e operation [30]. The continuous reactor 88 6 
 efficiency could be improved by optimal operating conditions in packed bed  mode [32]. Over several years, 89 
activated carbon was used for wastewater treatment. It provides both a supp ort matrix for biofilm development 90 
and a large surface area to adsorb substances passing through the rea ctor [35,36]. 91 
Pyrolyzed biomass, commonly referred to as biochar, is an alternative to ac tivated carbon, which is explored as 92 
a low-cost strategy for treating wastewater. Corn-cob (CC) biochar has been  identified as a suitable matrix for 93 
the immobilization of the bacterial cells in the continuous flow bioreactor. It facilitates the absorption of a large 94 
number of bacterial cells and biofilm formations, both inside and on th e surface of the biochar [37]. To date, no 95 
work has been reported on the aerobic bioremediation of Indanthrene Blue RS using CC-biochar in continuous 96 
up-flow packed-bed bioreactors. In the present study, Indanthrene Blue RS dye biodegradation was performed 97 
by immobilizing cells on CC-biochar. In an up-flow packed bed biorea ctor (UFPBBR), the continuous studies 98 
were performed to evaluate its effect on biodegradation using consortium-BP . Process parameters, including 99 
initial dye concentration, inoculum volume, and flow rate, were optimized for  maximum degradation efficacy. 100 
The performance of the reactor efficiency was evaluated with immobilized ce lls operated in batch and continuous 101 
mode. The UV-vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the percentage of decolorizatio n. Cells that were 102 
immobilized on CC-biochar continuously removed a high concentration o f Indanthrene Blue RS (500 mg L-1) 103 
by using the BB process. The findings suggest that this BB pro cess is more effective than conventional treatment 104 
approaches and has highe r effectiveness. 105 
2. Materials and methods 106 
2.1 Dyes and chemicals 107 
The textile anthraquinone vat dye, Indanthrene Blue RS, was procured fro m Sigma-Aldrich, India. The 108 
composition of liquid mineral‐base medium  (MBM) includes NaNO 3 (0.3%), KCl (0.05%), K 2HPO 4 (0.1%), 109 
MgSO 4 (0.05%), and yeast extract (0.02%) with glucose (1%). The alkaline pH of th e media was maintained by 110 
using sterilized NaOH (1M). The chemicals and media components used in these exper iments were of analytical 111 
grade .  112 
2.2 Microorganisms and culture conditions 113 
The isolation of a pure culture of Bacillus flexus TS8, Proteus mirabilis PMS, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCH 114 
were carried out from the textile wastewater under laboratory conditions. Under aerobic conditions, the culture 115 
was grown in 250 mL flask, each containing 100 mL of nutrien t broth, and was incubated at 30 ºC for 24 h. The 116 7 
 consortium-BP was prepared by aseptically transferring 24 h grown cult ure (50 mL) of each strain into 250 mL 117 
flasks to retain the equal number of cells in both the pure culture and the consortium, respectively.  118 
2.3 Evaluation of Corn-cob Biochar as a packing material  119 
The corn-cob was pyrolyzed at 400 °C to prepare biochar and was used as supporting material for microbial 120 
immobilization. The biochar was sterilized before use by autoclaving for 15  min at 15 psi (121 °C) to ensure that 121 
microbes were not involved during the adsorption process. FT-IR analysis by KBr pellet technique was performed 122 
to assess the presence of functional groups in biochar before and after adso rption using the Thermofisher 123 
Scientific, Nicolet IS10 in ATR mode (with the 16-scan speed in the mid-IR  range of 400 –4000 cm-1). CHNS 124 
analysis was carried out to determine the composition of existing element s in biochar, such as carbon, hydrogen, 125 
nitrogen, and sulfur (Elementar Analysen Systeme, Germany/Vario EL) . SEM analysis (JEOL JSM-6084LV) 126 
determines the surface morphology of the biochar. Biochar porosity, s urface area, and adsorption volume were 127 
evaluated using a BET analyzer (Quanta chrome/AUTOSORB-1). 128 
The CC-biochar has also been examined for the adsorption and desorption  of the Indanthrene Blue RS dye packed 129 
in the column. For adsorption experiments, 2.5 g of CC-biochar was added with Indanthrene Blue RS (100 mg L-130 
1) to 100 mL of MBM. The flasks were incubated in an isothermal shaker (1 20 rpm ) at room temperature. The 131 
samples were withdrawn at a regular time interval (30 min) for 4 h. The supernatant was then centri fuged at 8000 132 
rpm for 10 min. The percentage of dye removal was measured spectr ophotometrically at 520 nm. The desorption 133 
experiments were carried out by subsequently drying and transferr ing the spent CC-biochar sample into NaCl 134 
solution (100 mL ) (Voudrias et al., 2002). The flasks were incubated in an isothermal shaker,  and the study w as 135 
carried out as specified in adsorption experiments. The final concentrations o f desorbed dye were determined 136 
spectrophotometrically at 520 nm. 137 
2.4 Adsorption Study 138 
In Erlenmeyer flasks of 250 mL, th is study was conducted by subsequently changing the initial dye concentratio ns 139 
(25 to 150 mg L-1), contact time (5 to 240 min), adsorbent dose (0.2 to 2 g L-1), and temperature (25 to 50 °C). A 140 
UV-vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the dye concentration in the supernatant at 520 nm. The quantity 141 
of dye adsorbed by the unit weight of CC-biochar at time t, 𝑞𝑡(mg/g) and the percentage of removal of dye, R was 142 
determined as follows: 143 
𝑞𝑡=  (𝐶0−𝐶𝑡) ×𝑉
𝑊                                                                                                             (1) 144 8 
 𝑅% =(𝐶0−𝐶𝑡)
𝐶0×100                                                                                                      (2) 145 
Where 𝐶0 and 𝐶𝑡 (mg L-1) represents dye  concentrations  at  the  initial  and  any  time  (t,  min) ,  V, 𝑞𝑡, and W 146 
represents the volume of the solution (L), the adsorbed amount (mg g-1)  at any time (t, min), and the mass of 147 
adsorbent (g), respectively. 148 
2.4.1 Adsorption Isotherms 149 
The adsorption isotherms were determined by adding 1g L-1 of CC-biochar in 100 mL dye solution with varying 150 
concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 150 mg L-1). pH 10.0 was maintained, and the experiment was performed for 240  151 
min with continuous shaking at 30 °C to validate the equilibrium time. After  90 min incubation, the solution 152 
reached equilibrium. The difference between the two concentrations determin ed the quantity of adsorbed dye (mg 153 
g-1) on the surface of the adsorbent. 154 
The Freundlich and Langmuir isothermic equations were used to evaluate the exp erimental equilibrium data for 155 
Indanthrene Blue RS adsorption. The Langmuir isotherm model is establish ed on the presumption that the 156 
adsorbent has monolayer coverage on the outer surface of the adsorbent can  be defined in a linearly as: 157

𝐾𝐿𝑞𝑚𝐶𝑒                                                                                                                     (3) 158 
Where 𝐾𝐿: adsorption energy-related Langmuir constants, 𝑞𝑚: maximum adsorption capacity. The linear plot of  159 
1𝑞𝑒⁄ Vs.  1𝐶𝑒⁄can be used to derive the values of 𝐾𝐿 and 𝑞𝑚.  160 
The Freundlich isotherm refers to the heterogeneous adsorption surf aces. The following equation represents the 161 
linear form of freundlich isotherm as:  162 
ln𝑞𝑒=ln𝐾𝐹+1
𝑛ln𝐶𝑒                                                                                                                                   (4) 163 
Where 𝐾𝐹 (mg g-1): Freundlich isotherm constant related to the adsorbent’s adsorption capacity, n: Freundlich 164 
isotherm constant associated with the adsorbent affinity. 165 
2.4.2 Adsorption Kinetics 166 9 
 The Indanthrene Blue RS adsorption on the surface of the CC-biochar was ev aluated using the basic kinetic models 167 
to study the adsorption process. In this study, kinetic models o f the pseudo-first-order and pseu do-second-order 168 
are evaluated to identify the best fit model for the observed data. 169 
2.4.2.1 Pseudo-First-Order Kinetic Model 170 
The kinetic model of the pseudo-first-order equation stated that over time,  the solute absorption rate was related 171 
to the variation in the concentration of saturation and the adsorbed quantity . In most situations, the adsorption 172 
mechanism followed by diffusion over a boundary obeys the pseu do-first-order kinetic rate equation. The linear 173 
relation between the adsorbed dye  𝑞𝑡 (mg/g) and time t is described as: 174 
ln(𝑞𝑒− 𝑞 𝑡)=ln𝑞𝑒− 𝑘 1𝑡                                                                                                        (5) 175 
The pseudo-first-order kinetic rate constants 𝑞𝑒 (mg g-1) and 𝑘1 (min-1) are calculated from the intercept and the 176 
slope of the graph obtained from ln(𝑞𝑒− 𝑞 𝑡) vs. t. 177 
2.4.2.2 Pseudo-Second-Order Kinetic Model 178 
The kinetic model of the pseudo-second-order equation fits the adsorp tion mechanism, with chemisorptions 179 
becoming the rate-control. The pseudo-second-order model may defin e the linear form of adsorption kinetics as: 180 
𝑡
𝑞=1
𝐾2𝑞𝑒2+1
𝑞𝑒𝑡                                                                                                                     (6) 181 
The 𝑡/𝑞 𝑡 vs. t plot provides a straight line with 1/𝑞 𝑒 as slope and 1/𝐾 2𝑞𝑒 as intercept. The 𝐾2 value is computed 182 
from the intercept slope using 𝑞𝑒 estimated from the slope. 183 
2.5 Microbial growth and degradation of Indanthrene Blue RS in immobilized cell batch experiments 184 
The microbial growth was obtained by inoculating consortium-BP in the MBM medium. The degradation studies 185 
were carried out by adding a 5% (v/v) inoculum volume to various I ndanthrene Blue RS concentrations . An aliquot 186 
(2 mL) was withdrawn at a regular interval and was harvested by centri fuging at 8000 rpm for 10 min for 187 
separation of cell biomass. The decolorization efficiency was measured spectro photometrically by observing the 188 
culture supernatant at 520 nm (Shimadzu, UV-1800). The percentage of d ecolorization was defined as: 189 
% 𝐷𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =  (𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 − 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)
𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ×100                                       (7) 190 
2.6 Parameter optimization 191 10 
 Batch studies were carried out to optimize the process parameters such as pH (6.0 to 12.0), temperatur e (20 to 40 192 
ºC), and inoculum volume (1.0 ×106 to 5.0 × 106 CFU mL-1). The parameters were varied at a fixed concentration 193 
of Indanthrene Blue RS (200 mg L-1). All the studies were performed in triplicates. 194 
2.7 Effect of Dye Concentration in the Immobilized Cell Batch Reactor  195 
Indanthrene Blue RS dye decolorization was performed at varying dye co ncentrations using immobilized 196 
consortium cells in batch bioreactors at the optimal process parameters. The CC-biochar was used as the 197 
immobilization media. Such studies were performed to determine the maximum to lerated level up to which the 198 
microbes can actively degrade the dye without inhibition of the substrate as well as other possible toxic effects. 199 
The Indanthrene Blue RS dye decolorization studies were performed at concentr ations ranging from 100 to 7 00 200 
mg L-1. 201 
2.8 Up-Flow Packed Bed Bioreactor Set Up and Operation 202 
An up-flow packed bed bioreactor (PBBR) has been designed with a flat base using Perspex glass with 60 cm 203 
long and 8 cm in diameter, respectively. The PBBR consists of an inlet feed tank, peristaltic pump, air compressor, 204 
outlet tank, CC-biochar, and a reactor with a sampling port. The PBBR was operated under aerobic conditions by 205 
providing purified air in the bed. The biochar was packed across two tube grooves up to a height of 20 cm and 206 
was covered at the base by sieves (metal) of < 0.5 μm size and cotton (saturated with dye). The b ioreactor was 207 
loaded with 400 g of CC-biochar with 3016 mL and 1005 mL o f the total volume and working volume , 208 
respectively. The microbial culture in the liquid mineral-base medium was circulated to immobilize the bed 209 
adequately with consortium cells through the peristaltic pump. The medium was s upplied to the bioreactor in an 210 
upward direction to prevent channeling effects and increased retention time.  The airflow rate of 0.1 LPM was 211 
maintained and supplied by an air compressor at 30 ± 3 ºC (room temp erature). 212 
The bioreactor was subsequently operated with 500 mg L-1 of Indanthrene Blue RS dye solution in continuous 213 
mode from a feed tank of 25 L, and at varying feed rate (0.25 to  1.25 L h-1) was maintained for proper distribution 214 
using a peristaltic pump. The bioreactor inoculum was 10% of the volum e having 3.0 ×106 CFU/mL . The optim al 215 
parameters achieved from the batch experiments were considered for the b ioreactor operation. The Indanthrene 216 
Blue RS decolorization was performed over 20 days. The samples were with drawn on complete decolorization, 217 
centrifuged at 7168 ×g for 10 min, and then were quantified using  UV–vis spectroscopy.  218 
2.9 Degradation Analysis and Performance Equations  219 11 
 After complete decolorization, the supernatant was separated by centrifuging 50 mL of the culture medium at 220 
7168 ×g for 10 min. The extent of decolorization was determined at 520 nm using a UV –vis spectrophotometer. 221 
The PBBR performance in the continuous mode was calculated under op timal conditions and at varying inlet 222 
loading rates in the form of elimination capacity (EC) and removal efficienc y (RE) and defined by: 223

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 229 
3.1 Biochar Characterization and Analysis (FT-IR, CHNS, SEM, and BET Surface Area ) 230 
The efficiency of Biochar’s sorption depends mainly on the functionalit y’s chemical reactivity to the biochar 231 
surface and its porosity. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the fu nctional groups on the surface of the biochar 232 
allows for a better interpretation of the sorption process. When the biom ass is heated to 350 to 650 ºC, the chemical 233 
bonds break and rearrange, forming new functional groups [38]. The FT-IR analysis of the biochar indicates the 234 
participation of the stretching vibration of C-C (quinones) and N-H (ami ne) at 1101.1 cm-1 and 3471.2 cm-1, 235 
respectively, correspond to the N-H (amine) bending vibration at 1602.6 cm-1 before biosorption [39,40] 236 
(Supplementary Fig. 1).  237 
Pyrolysis may cause biosorption bands to disappear, which are charac teristic of raw material, and the new band 238 
appears typical for the biochar samples. The presence of the functional group after sorption results in the stretching 239 
vibrations of =C-O (ketones, aldehydes, and esters), C-N (nitrile), C-H  (alkyl), O-H (alcoholic and phenolic), and 240 
N-H (amine) at 1051.0 and 1708.6 cm-1, 1261.2 cm-1, 1386.5 cm-1, 3235.9 cm-1, and 3398.1 cm-1, respectively, 241 
correspond to the bending vibrations of –C-H (alkyl), N-H (amine) at 1386.5 cm-1 and 1579.4 cm-1 (Supplementary 242 
Fig. 1).  243 
The spectral analysis of CHNS (after sorption) resulted in an increase in the significant components of the 244 
respective samples: Carbon (70.97%), Hydrogen (1.22%), and Nitrogen ( 14.96%), and thus indicating its 245 
adsorption. On increasing the pyrolysis temperature, there is a n increase in the carbon content of the biochar [41,42]. 246 12 
 The high carbon content of the biochar possibly suggests that it still con tains a specific quantity of plant organic 247 
residues from plants (cellulose) [43]. Supplementary Table 1 illustrates the elemental analysis of corn-cob biochar 248 
before and after treatment.  249 
The surface morphology of the CC-biochar sample revealed an adequate number of free pores or absorption s ites 250 
on the surface using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) ( Supplementary Fig. 2). All these pores represent the 251 
efficiency of dye biodegradation by microbial strain on the biochar surface.  After pyrolysis, the morphology of 252 
CC-biochar was observed, and it revealed that biochar has a porous surf ace that facilitates bacterial cell growth 253 
and biofilm formation.  SEM images captured at 20000x displayed the biofilm formation on the co rn-cob biochar 254 
surface. Also, higher bacterial cell density was observed within the co rn-cob biochar when thin biochar cross- 255 
sections were examined under SEM (Supplementary Fig. 3).  256 
BET analysis concluded the surface area of 26.17 m 2 g-1, an average pore diameter of 5.25 nm, and a total pore 257 
volume of 0.08 cm3 g-1, which was higher than that of the previous studies reported for biochar . The surface area 258 
is one of the most significant properties of biochar and depends on f eedstock type [44,45]. Furthermore, the 259 
degradation of aliphatic alkyls and ester groups, and the exposure of the aromatic lignin core to higher pyrolysis 260 
temperatures, would result in an increased surface area [46]. The absorption of organic contaminants into the 261 
biochar depends on the total volumes of the micropores and mesopores . The absorption is further accelerated as 262 
the ionic radius is small, leading to the increased adsorption capacity o f the biochar [47,48]. The biochar surface is 263 
generally negatively charged owing to the dissociation of functional grou ps containing oxygen , which causes 264 
electrostatic attraction between biochar and positively charged molecules [48,49]. Rafiq et al. 2016 reported that an 265 
increase in temperature increased the biochar surface area [50]. It is because the pore-blocking compounds are 266 
washed off or thermally damaged with rising pyrolysis temperature,  thus increasing the surface area, which is 267 
readily accessible . As the temperature rises, the porosity of biochar increases because of the decomposition of 268 
lignin, the rapid production of H 2 and CH 4, and the aromatic condensation reaction [51,52]. Supplementary Fig. 4 269 
presented the BET surface area plot for corn-cob biochar. 270 
3.2 Stand-alone adsorption Studies of the Packing Material in Batch Mode 271 
3.2.1 Effects of Contact Time and Initial Dye Concentration, Adsorbent Dose, and Tem perature 272 
Before using the corn-cob biochar as the packing material, adsorption stud ies were performed without microbes 273 
to evaluate the adsorption efficiency in the removal of the dye. Indanthren e Blue RS dye adsorption studies were 274 13 
 conducted at different concentrations using corn-cob biochar (Fig. 1a). At varying initial dye concentrations, an 275 
increase in the decolorization efficiency was observed with a fixed-dose (1g  L-1) and temperature (30 °C). The 276 
study showed that equilibrium was attained within 90 mins (1.5 h). A fterward, no significant changes in the degree 277 
of adsorption were found. Indanthrene Blue RS concentration decreases significantly as the incubation time 278 
increas es. This finding suggested that the use of CC-biochar alone could partially  remove Indanthrene Blue RS. 279 
More than 80% adsorption was measured for an initial concentration of up to 50 mg L-1, while the dye removal 280 
percentage was reduced to 78% and 69% for 100 and 150 mg L-1, respectively. In the above observation, it is 281 
apparent that the adsorption is very fast for the lower initial dye concentration. The adsorption capacity of corn- 282 
cob biochar for an initial dye concentration of 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg L-1 was found to be 7.28, 9.81, 4.78, and 283 
2.22 mg g-1, respectively. The percent removal of dye reduces with a rise in initial concentration . This result was 284 
in agreement with that reported by Zheng et al., 2017 [31]. It needs a longer time to achieve equilibrium, and with 285 
increased concentration of dyes, competition for active adsorption sites wil l increase, and the adsorption process 286 
will slow down further [30,53]. It can be defined better by an adsorption mechanism where the dye molecu les first 287 
enter a boundary layer, then diffuse to the adsorbent surface from  the boundary layer film, and lastly diffuse 288 
through the adsorbent’s porous structure [41].  289 
 290 
Fig. 1.  Effects of Contact Time and Initial Dye Concentration, Adsorbent Dose, and Temperature on 291 
Indanthrene Blue RS adsorption. 292 
Fig. 1b shows the effect of adsorbent dose (ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 g L-1) on the dye absorption capacity at three 293 
varying initial dye concentrations 50, 100, and 150 mg L-1. At first, the significant rise in adsorption with the 294 
increase d dose can be d ue to the increased surface area and availability of more adsorption sites . After the critical 295 
dose of 1 g L-1, the adsorption rate is slowing increasingly. The percentage of r emoval of dye is increased as there 296 
is rapid superficial adsorption on the adsorbent surface at a higher adsor bent dose, resulting in a lower 297 
14 
 concentration of the solute in the solution than when the adsorben t dose is low. Similarly , as the initial dye 298 
concentration for constant adsorbent dose increases, the absorption of dye in creases due to the existence of more 299 
dye molecules in the solution [54].  300 
The effect of temperature on the adsorption of Indanthrene Blue RS is presented in Fig. 1c. The studies were 301 
performed at three varying concentrations of dye (50, 100, and 150 mg L-1) and four separate temperatures (25, 302 
30, 40, and 50 °C) utilizing 1 g L-1 of adsorbent dose. It was observed that as the temperature rises fr om 25 to 30 303 
°C, there was an increase in the adsorption rate. When the temperature rose f rom 35 to 50 °C, no significant 304 
difference in the removal percentage was observed [55]. Hence, the effect of temperature on Indanthrene Blue RS 305 
decolorization is negligible.  306 
The above results, therefore, suggest that the use of corn-cob biochar as an adsorbent is not an effective method 307 
since the adsorbent will soon become saturated due to the low adsorbent capacit y. 308 
3.2.2 Adsorption Kinetics and Isotherms  309 
The kinetic parameters were evaluated by using linear plots of pseudo-fir st-order, pseudo-second-order kinetic 310 
models (Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b). The parameters were determined, as presented in Table 1. The plot of 𝑙𝑛(𝑞𝑒− 𝑞 𝑡) vs. t 311 
will present a straight line with −𝑘 1 and 𝑙𝑛𝑞𝑒 as slope and intercept, allowing to evaluate the adsorption rate 312 
constant 𝑘1 and equilibrium adsorption capacity 𝑞𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙 (Fig. 2a). It was found that the experimental data point 313 
does not fit a straight line and the values determined for 𝑘1 and 𝑞𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙 are given in Table 1. Hence, it can be 314 
inferred from the findings that the kinetics of Indanthrene Blue RS adsorp tion on corn-cob biochar is not likely to 315 
follow the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and thus not a diffusion -controlled phenomenon. 316 
The 𝑡𝑞𝑡⁄vs. t plot gives a straight line with 1𝑞𝑒⁄, and 1(𝑘2𝑞𝑒2)⁄  as slope and intercept are presented in Fig. 2b. 317 
The 𝑘2 value is estimated from the intercept using 𝑞𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙 value determined from the slope. Table 1 shows the 318 
estimated value of 𝑘2, 𝑞𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙, and their respective regression coefficient (R2) values. The R2 value is 1.00 for 25 319 
and 50 mg L-1 and almost unity (0.99) for 100 and 150 mg L-1 of Indanthrene Blue RS, indicating that the 320 
Indanthrene Blue RS adsorption kinetics follows a pseudo-second-order k inetic model. It may also be observed 321 
from Table 1 that  𝑞𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙 values are very close to  𝑞𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑝 values that were obtained experimentally. Therefore, it 322 
can be stated that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model can describe the Indan threne Blue RS adsorption on CC- 323 
biochar better than the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the mec hanism is regulated by chemisorption. A 324 
similar result was observed by Zheng et al., 2017 for the adsorption of AO10 molecules onto MHSA- AC [31]. 325 15

The experimental equilibrium data were plotted (Fig. 3a, Fig. 3b) by using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm 330 
model at 30°C. The coefficient of correlation for Langmuir and Freundlich  adsorption isotherm is determined by 331 
16 
 applying the experimental adsorption equilibrium results and are given in Tab le 2. The Langmuir isotherm 332 
correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.98) is higher than the Freundlich isotherm obtained value (R2 = 0.84).   333 
As the dye concentration increases, the adsorption capacity increases , suggesting that the available binding sites 334 
were saturated immediately as more dye w as present in the aqueous solution [56]. In an aqueous solution, the dye 335 
molecul e and the corn-cob biochar exist as cation and anion, respectively. Consequently , adsorption is considered 336 
to be the chemisorption in nature and describes that the adsorption is taking  place on strongly homogeneous 337 
surfaces.  338

 The equilibrium data for the Indanthrene Blue RS adsorption onto CC-bioch ar are best fitted with the Langmuir 342 
isotherm model, indicating that the monolayer coverage of the dye molecule o ccurs over the adsorbent surface. In 343 
the Freundlich isotherm model, the value for n greater than 1 represents the favorable adsorption, and the adsorbent 344 
is efficient for the entire range of dye concentrations [57]. Therefore, the Langmuir isotherm model would reflect 345 
the adsorption mechanism better physically than the Freundlich isotherm mo del (Table 2). 346 
3.3 Batch Biodegradation 347 
Batch experiments were carried out by varying the optimum parameters such  as pH, temperature, and inoculum 348 
volume to evaluate the optimal values for the Indanthrene Blue RS decolorization . It was observed that the 349 
removal percentage of Indanthrene Blue RS increases rapidly with a pH i ncreases from 9.0 to 10 .0 with an 350 
optimum pH as 10.0 at which the RE of 96.2% was found (Fig. 4a). The temperature range of 20 to 40 ºC was 351 
evaluated. It was found that the RE increased at 30 ºC to 94.3% and then d ecreased drastically (Fig. 4b) similar 352 
to the findings of Das et al [58]. As the inoculum volume increased from 1.0 ×106 to 5.0 × 106 CFU mL-1, the RE 353 
increased rapidly to 95.2% at an inoculum volume of 3.0 × 106 CFU mL-1 (Fig. 4c). The optimal value of pH, 354 
temperature, and inoculum volume were found to be 10.0, 30 ºC, and 3.0 × 106 CFU mL-1, respectively.  355

3.4 Biodecolorization of Indanthrene Blue RS in Continuous Up-Flow Packed Bed Bioreactor 358 
UFPBBR was performed within the concentration range of 100 to 500 m g L-1 to assess the impact of the initial 359 
dye concentration on the percentage of removal using optimal parameters ach ieved from batch experiments. The 360 
percentage removal of Indanthrene Blue RS at an initial dye concentration of 500  mg L-1 increases by about 90% . 361 
It decreases with a subsequent rise in dye concentration owing to the in hibitory effects of substrates . 362 
Supplementary Fig. 5 illustrates the effect of different initial Indanthrene Blue RS concentration on the adsorption 363 
18 
 capacity of CC-Biochar and bacteria-immobilized CC-Biochar. It was, ther efore, evident that the immobilization 364 
significantly improved the ability of the microbial cells to degrade the dy e effectively.  365 
The increased surface area of CC-biochar enabled the interactions between both  the dye molecules and bacterial 366 
cells at higher concentrations to achieve a higher decolorization percentage. Th e dye molecules were adsorbed by 367 
the pores and the active sites found on the surface of the CC-biochar and thus established active target sites for 368 
the immobilization of the bacterial cells. The active sites on the CC-biochar transfo rm the dye molecules into 369 
environmentally friendly by-products with the help of the bacteria that are immobilized on the biochar and thus 370 
renew the porous structure further for adsorption [59,60]. A synergistic effect was established by the subsequent 371 
degradation of Indanthrene Blue RS dye by the bacterial cells together with activ e sites on the surface of the 372 
biochar that attributed to the significant dye degradation at higher concentratio ns. Similar findings have been 373 
documented in earlier studies showing the effectiveness of immobilized cell s ystems for dye degradation [30,61]. 374 
3.4.1 Effect of Flow Rate on Removal Efficiency 375 
The UFPBBR efficiency was evaluated in continuous mode (CUFPBBR) usin g optimal parameters acquired from 376 
batch experiments by differing the feed flow rate (0.25, 0.5, 0. 75, 1.0, and 1.25 L h-1) and Indanthrene Blue RS 377 
concentration in the range as in UFPBBR. In a continuous process, the  flow rate determines the dyes 378 
decolorization within the effluent. Initially, the bioreactor was maintained at the feed flow rate of 0.25 L h-1 to 379 
enable adequate bacterial growth, with glucose as a carbon source, and to maintain a steady-state condition. On 380 
the 6th day of operation, the steady-state was established that is apparent with t he almost constant removal 381 
efficiency (95%) (Fig. 5). It was observed that about 6 days are required for the acclimation of consortium-BP for 382 
effective decolorization of Indanthrene Blue RS.  383 
Moreover, a significant reduction in decolorization was reported at high flow rates. The flow rate was increased 384 
on the 11th day to 0.50 L h-1. On the 12th day, a rapid decrease in RE was found the following, which the RE  385 
amended and then became stable at 95% on the 15th day. The flow rates were improved to 0.75 L h-1 on the 16th 386 
day. The bioreactor performance was similar, which is a significant d ecline led by a 95% recovery in removal 387 
efficiency and stabilization. On the 22nd day, the flow rate increased to 1.0 L h-1, and after a sudden decline, the 388 
RE stabilized at 79.6%. The steady-state RE value dropped significantly at a f low rate of 1.25 L h-1 and maintained 389 
at about 69%. The decline in RE value was sharper above the flow rate of 0 .75 L h-1, indicating a change in the 390 
bioreactor’s control mechanism [53]. The interaction of the dye molecule with cells immobilized on CC-biochar 391 
requires longer retention time.  Chen et al. 2005 reported that the dye molecule s required more retention time to 392 19 
 interact with the bacteria cell than the time necessary for the intraparticle diffusio n [62]. Though biosorption took 393 
place during the process, and there is a possibility that the consortia cells used the adsorbed dye onto CC-biochar 394 
for degradation. It was observed that nearly 6% to 8% of the decolorizatio n was due to the biosorption of the dye 395 
onto the biochar, with most of the decolorization attributed to the dye u tilization by the bacterial consortia [63]. 396 
Biodegradation is attributed to the dye degradation process in the present wor k since the adsorption process only 397 
occurs during the initial stage of reactor operation. The continuous BB pro cess can be divided into two phases. In 398 
the first phase, the concentration of Indanthrene Blue RS gradually decrea ses, suggesting that biosorption on CC- 399 
biochar plays a leading role and that much of the Indanthrene Blue RS molec ules are adsorbed. The high 400 
adsorption capacity of CC-Biochar, thus eliminates the toxic risk to t he immobilized bacterial cells. CC-biochar 401 
reaches the highest adsorption value at equilibrium in the second phase, and b iodegradation occurs considerably 402 
until the Indanthrene Blue RS is completely eliminated . Throughout the entire continuous BB process, the 403 
continuous removal of Indanthrene Blue RS significantly differs fr om the usual CC-Biochar adsorption process. 404

 The difference in the removal efficiency and elimination capacity of the Indanthrene Blue RS at varying inlet 409 
loading rate is illustrated in Fig. 7. The Indanthrene Blue RS inlet loading plo t displays two separate regions for 410 
the mass transfer zone and bio-reaction zone. With an increment in the inlet lo ading rate of Indanthrene Blue RS 411 
from 100 to 500 mg L-1 d-1, the RE was found to continuously increase above 90% to the loading rate of 300 mg 412 
L-1 d-1 after which it continually decreased. EC linearly increased with an incr easing inlet loading rate of 413 
Indanthrene Blue RS and reached its highest value of 446 .1 mg L-1 d-1 at the loading rate of 500 mg L-1 d-1. 414 
Similarly, the EC keeps increasing with an increase in Indanthrene Blue RS loading, which is evident from a slight 415 
variation in the EC vs. Inlet loading rate plot (Fig. 7). Such results thu s confirm the difference in the reactor 416 
controlling mechanism throughout the entire biodegradation process [53,64,65]. 417 
 418 
Fig. 6.  Effect of inlet Indanthrene Blue RS load on elimination capacity and remov al efficiency. 419 
The diffusional flux through the biofilm would be reduced at low loadin g rates, result ed in mass transfer 420 
limitations. The inner part of the biofilm at the packing media surface re mains substrate deficiency and is never 421 
used by microbes for effective biodegradation. Whereas high loading rate s resulted in higher diffusional flux, 422 
thereby changing the process between the mass transfer zone to the b io-reaction controlling zone. The contaminant 423 
rapidly approaches the innermost layers of biofilm, and microbes use th e adequate substrate available through the 424 
21 
 biodegradation control mechanism. At the initial loading rate of 300 mg L-1 d-1, it was observed that the process 425 
moved from the mass-transfer zone to the bio-reaction controlling region ( Fig. 7).  426 
A rise in the inlet loading rate from 100 to 300 mg L-1 d-1 resulted in increased use of the biofilm corresponding 427 
to nearly constant RE with a significant increase in EC value. Th e substrate inhibition with high er concentrations 428 
of Indanthrene Blue RS may lead to decreased RE [53]. The operation of bioreactors with an appropriate value of 429 
RE in the bio-reaction controlling region is always satisfactory. The o ptimal operating range for this study lies 430 
around 300 to 395.4 mg L-1 d-1. The inlet loading rate where the process in the bioreactor moves fro m a mass 431 
transfer zone to the bio-reaction controlling zone and the RE and EC plot intersection value can be used for 432 
industrial applications as an estimated calculation of the bioreactor’s operating concentration range (Fig . 6). 433 
Therefore, the continuous immobilized UFPBBR showed promising results  that can be used for practical 434 
applications. 435 
Conclusion 436 
The UFPBBR immobilized with CC-biochar significantly increased the ability o f the bacterial cells to degrade 437 
the dye effectively. The increased surface area of CC-biochar enabled the inter actions in between the dye 438 
molecules and bacterial cells to achieve a higher decolorization percentage at hig her concentrations. The 439 
adsorption kinetics showed that the Indanthrene Blue RS adsorption on CC-biochar followed the pseudo-second- 440 
order kinetic model. Similarly, the adsorption of Indanthrene Blue RS on CC-biochar followed the Langmuir 441 
isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 4.55 mg g-1 at 30 ºC. An increase in the inlet loading 442 
rate of Indanthrene Blue RS from 100 to 500 mg L-1 d-1, the RE is continually increasing above 90% to the loading 443 
rate of 300 mg L-1 d-1, after which; it begins to decrease. The EC value continued to increase li nearly with 444 
Indanthrene Blue RS inlet loading rate and reached the highest value o f 446.1 mg L-1 d-1 with RE of 75.2% at 500 445 
mg L-1 d-1 loading rate . The present study combined the biosorption and biodegradation processes  to develop a n 446 
efficient treatment strategy.  The above results suggest that the developed consortium-BP and the continuous  447 
immobilized UFPBBR have shown promising results that combine the ad vantages of both biosorption and 448 
biodegradation processes. The UFPBBR can be used for practical applications at ind ustrial scale in decolorizing 449 
and simultaneously reducing the toxicity of textile effluents containing  anthraquinone dyes. 450
