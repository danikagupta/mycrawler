Abstract - Synthetic dyes are widely used in the textile, cosmetic, printing, drug, and food processing industries. Triphenylmethane 
dyes belong to the most important group of synthetic dyes. They are generally considered as the xenobiotic compounds, which are  
very recalcitrant to biodegradation. Bacillus sp., was isolated from the treatment plant effluent of a textile and dyeing industry (SITEX) 
located in Ksar Hellal, Tunisia, decolorizes crystal violet (500 ppm) within 2.5 h under shaking condition at pH 7 and temperat ure 
30 °C. The effect of dye concentration, temperature and initial pH of the solution were studied. The results obtained from the batch 
experiments revealed the ability of bacteria in removing dye. UV-Vis spectroscopy and FTIR analysis of samples before and after  dye 
decolorization in culture medium confirmed decolorization of crystal violet. The phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity studies o f extracted 
metabolites suggest the less toxic nature of them. 
Key words: decolorization, Bacillus sp., trihenylmethane dyes, crystal violet, phytotoxicity. 
INTRODUCTION
Large numbers of chemically different dyes are used for vari-
ous industrial applications and significant proportion appears in the form of wastewater and is spilled into the environment. Improper chemical disposal of dyes leads to the reduction in sun-light penetration in receiving water bodies that causes decrease in photosynthetic activity and dissolved oxygen. The physical and chemical treatments available have limited use and are having high operational cost (Alexander, 1994) Synthetic dyes used are recalcitrant to be removed by conventional wastewater treatments such as adsorption, photo-oxidation, coagulation, flocculation, photodegradation and chemical degradation and biological process. The biological degradation is highly promis-ing, relatively inexpensive, ecofriendly and presents a reduced sludge production in comparison with chemical-physical treat-ment. Currently an extensive research is focused to find optimal microbial biomass, which is as cheap as possible for removal of contaminating dyes from large volumes of polluted water (Jadhav and Govindwar, 2006). There are a few reports on biodegradation of triphenylmethane dyes. Some authors have reported degrada-tion by aerobic bacteria or consortium, by yeast, by microalgae and by anaerobic bacteria (Casas et al., 2009). The triphenyl-
methane groups of dyes are used extensively in textile dyeing and dye-stuff manufacturing industries, as a biological stain and in paper printing. Some of the triphenylmethane dyes are used 
as dermatological agents, the best among them is gentian violet, which has also been used for oral consumption for pinworms and tropical application in human and in domestic animals and has been shown to be effective in controlling fungal growth under varying conditions(Au et al., 1978). 
 Crystal violet is a triphenylmethane dye used as a biological 
stain or as dermatological agent. For many years it was used as oral medication for treatment of pinworms and other tropical 
diseases because of its great effect in controlling fungal growth 
under varying conditions (Casas et al., 2009). Investigations 
on crystal violet in vitro concluded that this dye was a mitotic 
poisoning agent. In addition in vivo studies proved that, crys-
tal violet should be regarded as a biohazard substance (Au et 
al., 1978). Unfortunately, wastewater treatment facilities are 
often unable to remove commercial dyestuffs including crystal 
violet dye and this effluent contaminates aqueous habitats 
(Micheals and Lewis, 1985). Crystal violet was also found 
to cause reduced RNA and protein synthesis and decreased oxygen consumption in rabbit granulation tissue (Diachenko, 1979). Diachenko, 1979 reported the deposition of crystal violet and malachite green and aniline in the sediments and water of Buffalo River, New York, USA thus posing a threat to aquatic environment and human population. It was shown that theses dyes have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. These chemicals have been suggested to be responsible for the promotion of tumor growth in several bottom feeding species of fish (Diachenko, 1979).

 The textile and dyestuff industrial wastes are generally treated 
by physicochemical methods (including adsorption, chemical pre-cipitation and flocculation, oxidation by chlorine, H
2O2 and ozone 
electrolysis, electrochemical treatment and ion pair extraction), which are significantly different in color removal, volume capabil-ity, operating speeds and capital costs. It was found that 15% of triphenylmethane dyes, which are currently manufactured, are lost to waste water as a result of inefficiency in the chemical and physical treatment processes (Chen et al., 2008). Yatome et al. 
(1993) reported that four triphenylmethane dyes (basic fuchsin, methyl violet, crystal violet and Victoria blue) were biodegraded using Pseudomonas pseudomollei  13NA. The half-decolorization 
time was 54 h for both methyl violet and crystal violet when 4.08 mg/l dye was applied. In addition Yatome et al. (1991) noticed 
that the decolorization of several triphenylmethane dyes could be obtained using Bacillus subtilis , Escherichia coli  and some species 
of Pseudomonas  (P. cepacia,  P. cruciviae  and P. stutzeri ). They 
reported B. subtilis  remarkably decolorized 2.85 mg/l of crystal 
violet after 24 h. This study aims to investigate the potential of a Bacillus 
sp. isolated from textile wastewater for decolorizing a solution containing a triphenylmethane dye, crystal violet. Correlation of the kinetic properties with dye concentration and other rate-dependent environmental parameters (dye concentration, pH and temperature) were characterized. The phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity of the products formed after decolorization 
were studied.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Dyes and chemicals. The triphenylmethane dye Crystal 
Violet (CV) was obtained from the Sigma Chemical Company, MO, and USA. The dyes concentration was measured with a spectrophotometer UV-Visible (UV-2401 PC, Shimadzu, Japan) at maximum absorption wavelengths λ
max = 592 nm (Table 1).
Growth medium. Mineral salts medium (MSM) were 
prepared by adding the following components (in g): MgSO4 
(0.1), (NH4)2SO4 (0.6), NaCl (0.5), K2HPO4 (1.36), CaCl2 
(0.02), MnSO4 (1.1 mg/l), ZnSO4 (0.2 mg/l), CuSO4 (0.2 
mg/l), FeSO4 (0.14 mg/l) in 1000 ml of distilled water.
 The MSM pH was adjusted to 7.0 (Moutaouakkil et al., 
2003; Ayed et al., 2009) and was supplemented with 1.25 g/l 
glucose and 3 g/l yeast extract at different concentration unless mentioned. The yeast extract, glucose and dyes were added to sterilized MSM from their respective filter sterilized stock solu-tions.
Isolation and screening of dye degrading microorganism.  
The Agar-plate screening method used for dyes decoloriza-tion was described by Khehra et al., (2005). Briefly, activated 
sludge samples were collected from a textile dyeing industry and screened for dye decolorization organisms. Samples of activated sludge (10 g) were added to 100 ml of mineral basal medium (6 g/l Na
2HPO4 , 0.5 g/l NaCl, 3 g/l K2HPO4, 1 ml/l MgSO4, 0.14 g/l 
NH4Cl) and kept on an orbital shaker (SI-600, Lab Companion, 
Jeio-tech, Korea) at 150 rpm at 37 °C for 12 h. After 48 h of incubation, 1 ml of the culture broth was appropriately diluted and plated on MSM-agar containing crystal violet (500 ppm). The colonies were selected on their ability to form clear zones on the MSM-agar plates. Such colonies were subsequently transferred to MSM medium containing different concentrations of dyes. Crystal violet was decolorized on solid media by Bacillus sp. which was 
used for decolorization assay.
Decolorization assay and COD removal. Decolorizing activity 
was expressed in terms of decolorization percentage as indi-cated by Khehra et al. (2005) and determined by monitoring 
the decrease of the absorbance at λ
max = 592 nm CV. Chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) was determined spectrometrically by 5B-1 Quick COD analyzer (LianHua Environmental Instrument Institute, Langzhou, PR China). Experiments were performed in flasks containing 100 ml MSM medium and 500 ppm of dye. The flasks were inoculated with 5 ml Bacillus sp. (isolated from indus-
trial textile wastewater). The inoculum’s size were adjusted at 1 OD at λ = 600 nm (7 x 10
8 cells/ml) and incubated under shaking 
condition (150 rpm) at 37 °C (El-Naggar et al., 2004). The sam-
ples were withdrawn at different time intervals and analysed for decolorization assay. The flask containing dyes and MSM without the bacteria served as control. From time to time a 5 ml samples was taken and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min. The absorb-ance of supernatant was spectrophotometrically determined using spectrophotometer (UV-2401 PC, Shimadzu). All assays were per-formed in triplicate and compared with the control. Decolorization activity was calculated as described by Parshetti et al. (2006), 
Daneshvar et al. (2007) and Ayed et al. (2009).

Decolorization at different concentration of dye. 
The decolorization of crystal violet was tested at different concentrations of the mentioned dyes (500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 ppm) as described by El-Naggar et 
al. (2004). The respective dyes were added separately 
to 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of MSM medium. The flask containing dyes was inoculated with 5 ml of Bacillus sp. suspension which was adjusted at 1 OD 
at λ=600 nm (7 x 10
8 CFU/ml). The inoculum size was 
incubated under shaking condition (150 rpm) at 30 °C.
Decolorization at different pH and temperatures. The 
decolorization studies of crystal violet (500 ppm) were carried out at pH 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 by adjusting pH of the medium using 0.1 N HCl and 0.1 N NaOH. Bacillus sp. was grown at respec-
tive pH at 30 °C for 96 h under shaking condition and used for decolorization studies. Similarly the decolorization of crystal vio-let (500 ppm) was carried out at different temperatures 5, 25, 30, 40 and 50 °C by using 96 h grown bacterium at pH 7. Flasks were incubated at respective temperatures for 30 min before addition of the dye and decolorization was observed.
UV-Vis spectral analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared 
Spectroscopy (FTIR). Decolorization was monitored by UV-Vis 
spectroscopic analysis (Hitachi U-2800), whereas biodegrada-tion was monitored by FTIR. The same sample was used for UV–Vis spectral analysis, and FTIR analysis. Spectral analysis was carried out using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (2401 PC, Shimadzu), and changes in its absorption spectrum (400-800) were recorded. FTIR analysis was carried out using Perkin Elmer 783 Spectrophotometer and changes in % transmission at differ-ent wavelengths were observed. The FTIR analysis of extracted metabolites was done on Perkin Elmer, Spectrum one instrument and compared with control dye in the mid IR region of 400-4000 cm
-1 with 16 scan speed. The samples were mixed with spec-
troscopically pure KBr in the ratio 2:200, pellets were fixed in sample and the analysis was carried out.
Phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity studies. The phytotoxic-
ity studies were carried out using 500 ppm concentration of crys-tal Violet and its extracted metabolites using seeds of Triticum 
aestivum  and Sorghum bicolor , with distilled water as a control. 
The microbial toxicity of control CV and its degradation products (500 ppm) was carried out using Bacillus sp. on Mueller and 
Hinton agar plate having composition (g/l): beef infusion solids, 4.0; starch, 1.5; casein hydrolysate, 17.5; agar, 15.0).The pH of 
the medium was adjusted to 7. The plates are incubated at 30 °C and the zones of inhibition are measured.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Decolorization performance and removal of COD by 
Bacillus sp. under shaking conditions 
The effect of initial concentration of CV on decolorization of CV was studied at different initial concentrations of CV dye 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 ppm. The percent decolorization decreased with increase in CV concentration at 24 h of incuba-tion (Fig. 1). Results show that with 500 ppm dye concentration in MSM, 100% of the colour was removed after 2.5 h (Fig. 2). COD removal was 85%. Dafale et al. (2008) showed that 70% 
COD was removed during shaking condition for Remazol Black B (RBB). Bacillus subtilis  was able to decolorize crystal violet dye up 
to 40 mg/l and the maximum decolorization rate (1.25 mg/l/h) was obtained when 15 mg/l crystal violet was applied. Other investigators reported that, crystal violet can be degraded by Nocardia corralina  and a complete removal of 0.49 ppm crystal 
violet was observed after 24 h of incubation with a decolorization rate of 0.039 mg/l/h (Yatome et al., 1993). Moreover, Bumpus 
and Brock (1988) reported that, a complete degradation of 5 mg/l crystal violet by Phanerocheate chrysosporium  was carried

out within 72 h of incubation. (Khehra et al., 2005) suggested 
that the decrease in decolorization efficiency might be due to the toxic effect of dyes.  The various physicochemical parameters such as pH, tem-perature were found to affect the rate of decolorization as well as percent decolorization data shown in Table 2. The pH opti-mum for decolorization was 7 and temperature optimum was 30 °C. The results showed essentially no thermal inactivation of 
decolorization activity under operational temperatures, indicat-
ing that Bacillus sp. could acclimatize them to a broad range of 
temperature of practical dyeing wastewater. Previously, several researches had proved that biosorption processes using algae were highly pH dependent and the most important parameters to be considered (Aksu and Tezer, 2005; Kumar et al., 2006).
 These results indicate that  Bacillus sp. could treat practical 
basic dyeing wastewater at normal operational temperature and largely decreases the economic cost for acidification. The trend of pH dependence of decolorization is similar to that observed in Pseudomonas luteola (Kumar et al., 2006). For Bacillus sp., 
the isoelectric point would be at a pH of 7.0 as. In addition we noted that, at lower pH value, the H
+ ions compete effectively 
with dye cations, causing a decrease in colour removal efficiency. Furthermore, at higher pH above this point charge, the surface of biomass gets negatively charged, which enhances the positively charged dye cations through electrostatic force of attraction. This can be observed from the considerable increase in colour removal efficiency from 10 to 25% for an increase in pH from 3.0 to 4.0 (Daneshvar et al., 2007).Degradation product analysis
UV-Vis analysis (400-800) of supernatants of different time intervals showed decolorization and decrease in dye concentra-tion from batch culture. Crystal violet displays three absorption peaks of CV at λ
max 592, 411, 330 nm in the UV-vis spectra. 
The intensity of these peaks decreased remarkably after aero-bic treatment due to decolorization. Further, a new peak was observed at λ
max = 265 nm consistently in all the spectra of final 
samples. This suggests the formation of an intermediate during 
aerobic decolorization of CV. Peak observed at 592 nm (0 h) was 
decreased without any shift in λmax up to complete decoloriza-
tion of medium (2.5 h) (Fig. 3). According to Asad et al. (2007) 
decolorization of dyes by bacteria could be due to adsorption by microbial cells, or to biodegradation. In the case of adsorption, the UV-Vis absorption peaks decrease approximately in propor-tion to each other, whereas in biodegradation, either the major visible light absorbance peak disappears completely, or a new peak appears (Fig. 3). Remarkable variations in the fingerprint region (1500 to 500 cm
-1) of the FTIR (Fig. 4A) spectroscopy of control CV and 2.5 
h extracted metabolites indicate biodegradation of the dye by Bacillus sp. FTIR spectra of control CV showed the specific peaks 
in fingerprint region (1500 to 500 cm
-1) for the mono-substituted 
and para disubstituted benzene rings which is supporting to the peak at 1587 cm
-1 for the C=C stretching of the benzene ring. 
Also the peak at 1171 cm-1 for aromatic C-N stretching vibra-
tions. At 2923 cm-1 showed C-H asymmetric stretching and free 
-NH2 group showed amide antisymmetric stretching vibration 
at 3413 cm-1. The peak at 758 cm-1 indicates symmetric out of TABLE 2 - Effect of pH and temperature on the decolorization of crystal violet

bands below 900 cm-1 indicate aromatic nature of the compound. 
Absence of peaks at 688 cm-1, 726 cm-1, 765 cm-1 and 827 cm-1 
indicates loss of aromaticity or benzene ring. 
Phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity studies
Disposal of the untreated dyeing effluent, without any treatment, in water bodies cause serious environmental and health hazards. Besides the use of dye contaminated water is harmful to agri-culture. Thus it was of prime interest to assess the phytotoxicity of the dye and its extracted metabolites after degradation. The relative sensitivities towards the crystal violet and its degrada-
tion products in relation to S. bicolor  and T. aestivum  seeds are 
presented in Table 3. Phytotoxicity study shows well germination rate as well as significant growth in shoot and root for both the plants, grownin metabolites extracted after decolorization, as compared to the dye (500 ppm). Table 3 displays the compara-tive growth of plumule and radical in S. bicolor  and T. aestivum  
seeds. Hence phytotoxicity studies revealed that biodegradation of the dye by a microbial culture, resulted in its detoxification. Thus treated effluent can be used for ferti-irrigation. Microbial toxicity on Bacillus sp. showed growth inhibitory 
zone (1.0 cm) surrounding the well containing dye, while product did not show inhibitory zone also confirmed the nontoxic nature of the extracted metabolite.
CONCLUSION
The present study revealed the ability of Bacillus sp. to decolorize 
crystal violet. The results showed that the decolorization depend on the dye concentration, pH and temperature. Over the range

of 5-50 °C the decolorization rate increased with the temperature 
rise. The optimal decolorization pH and temperature is attributed at pH 7 temperature 30 °C. In this study we demonstrated a typical time-dependent UV-Vis spectrum of CV solution during biodegradation (Fig. 3). The absorbance peaks, corresponding to dye, diminished which indicated that the dye had been removed. The spectrum of CV in visible region exhibited a main peak with a maximum at 592 nm. The decrease of absorbance peak of CV at λ
max = 592 nm in this figure indicated a rapid degradation of 
the dye. According to the pervious literature (Chang and Kuo, 2000) decolorization of dyes can be due to adsorption to biomass or biodegradation. If the dye removal is attributed to biodegrada-tion, either the major visible light absorbance peak will disappear or a new peak will appear. In addition, extra absorbance peaks appeared in decolorized solution, probably resulting from the absorbance of metabolites or degraded fragments of dye mol-ecules. These results indicate that the color removal by  Bacillus 
sp. may be largely attributed to biodegradation. CV was degrad-ed into non-toxic compound by Bacillus sp. As previous reports 
showed crystal violet degradation into leucocrystal violet this was found to be equally toxic to malachite green. This strain has also the ability to decolorize other dyes including textile dyes and the use of cheap sources such as molasses for decolorization.
