Abstract
Laccases are oxidoreductases with the outstanding ability to oxidize phenolic and non-phenolic substrates coupled to the
reduction of O2 to H2O. Among them, bacterial enzymes are suitable biocatalysts for application in industrial processes under
harsh conditions. However, to be active on high redox potential substrates, bacterial laccases requires of redox mediators:
electron carriers between the laccase and other compounds not directly oxidizable by the enzyme. Here we demonstrate that
b-(10-phenothiazyl)-propionic acid can be used as an ecient and low-cost redox mediator for decolorization of synthetic dyes
by bacterial laccases. Using this laccase-mediator system, more than 80% of Indigo Carmine and Malachite Green decolorization
was reached after 1 h or 2 h of incubation, respectively, both at pH 8 and in tap water (pH 6.8). Furthermore, more than
40% of Remazol Brilliant Blue R and 80% of Xylidine ponceau were decolorized after 5 h at pH 8 and 50 ¬∞C. In addition, we
showed this system supports at least 3 decoloration cycles without loss of activity, representing a promising biological process for
cost-eective and environmentally friendly decolorization and degradation of synthetic dyes and for other industrial applications
of laccases requiring neutral or alkaline pH.

Introduction
Laccases (benzenediol: oxygenoxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) are multicopper oxidoreductases ubiquitous in
nature being found in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects (Janusz et al., 2020). They are active on a wide

Data may be preliminary.range of phenolic and non-phenolic substrates that are oxidized in a mononuclear reactive center formed by
a type I copper atom, followed by an intramolecular electronic transfer reaction of 4 electrons to a trinuclear
center composed of one type II copper atom and two type III copper atoms, which perform the reduction
of O 2to H 2O (Jones and Solomon, 2015; Mate and Alcalde, 2017). Furthermore, the enzyme activity and
range of oxidizable substrates can be enhanced by the presence of redox mediators. Redox mediators are
low molecular weight substrates that, after oxidization by the laccase, could generate high redox potential
intermediaries that act as electron carriers to non-enzymatically oxidize other compounds that are not direct
substrates of the enzyme due to low kinetics or steric issues (Morozova et al., 2007; Ca~ nas and Camarero
2010). Due to their broad range of substrates, laccases and laccase-mediator systems (LMS) possess many
biotechnological applications such as delignication of paper pulp (Singh and Arya, 2019), pre-treatment
of biomass for biofuel production, biobleaching of textile dyes (Rodriguez Couto, 2012), degradation of
environmental organic pollutants (Arregui et al., 2019) and pharmaceuticals (Mluguza et al., 2019), organic
synthesis (Kunamneni et al., 2008), in beverage and food industry (Mayolo-Deloisia et al., 2020), and the
design of biosensors and biofuel cells (Zhang et al., 2018). However, the success for industrial use of laccases
depends on not only on the optimization of the catalytic performance of the system but also of the production
eciency of the enzyme and mediator, which is one of the main barriers to commercialization of LMS.
Many synthetic molecules such as 2,2 /acute.ts1-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt
(ABTS), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), derivatives of lignin such as syringaldehyde, vanillin, ferulic acid,
acetosyringone, and p-coumaric acid and fungal metabolites were assayed as redox mediators for fungal
and bacterial enzymes (Arregui et al., 2019; Camarero et al., 2005; Ca~ nas and Camarero, 2010; Morozova
et al., 2007; Singh and Arya, 2019). Also there are a few reports describing the use of phenoxazines and
phenothiazines as a redox mediators for dye decolorization biobleaching of indigo carmine in the denim
nishing process and oxidation of bisphenol A by fungal enzymes (Camarero et al., 2005; Ivanec-Goranina
et al., 2015; Moldes and Sanrom an, 2006; Soares et al., 2001). Despite this, a great eort is being made to
nd new and better compounds that meet the characteristics of an ideal redox mediator: it must be readily
available, stable in its oxidized and reduced forms, non-toxic, aordable and support successive cycles of
oxide-reduction without degradation (Morozova et al., 2007; Ca~ nas and Camarero, 2010).
As the rst microbial laccases discovered, fungal enzymes have been extensively explored for industrial use,
however, bacterial laccases are gaining an increasing importance due to their robustness under harsh condi-
tions. Bacterial laccases are usually more stable at high temperatures and many of them present tolerance
to high chloride concentrations -up to 1M- and to diverse solvents (Chauhan et al., 2017; Guan et al., 2018;
Janusz et al., 2020). Furthermore, bacterial enzymes show activity at alkaline pH, while fungal laccases are
generally active only at acidic pH. These features make bacterial enzymes excellent candidates for the treat-
ment of textile euents, which usually show high salinity and alkaline pH (Arregui 2019; Yaseen and Scholz,
2019). The release of industrial dyes into watercourses is a major environmental concern. They are usually
toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic and increase the biochemical and chemical oxygen demand and reduce the
light penetration in water, aecting the aquatic ecosystems (Lellis et al., 2019). Among the methods assayed
for the treatment and bioremediation of euents, the use of biological systems, particularly those based on
laccases, are of the most promising for the removal and degradation of recalcitrant organic contaminants
(Bilal et al., 2019 Katheresan et al., 2018).
In order to nd an ecient and environmentally friendly laccase-mediator system (LMS) functional at neu-
tral to alkaline pH, we explored the use of bacterial laccases CotA from Bacillus subtilis and SilA from
Streptomyces ipomoeae along with phenothiazine and N-substituted derivatives (Fig. 1) as redox mediators
for decolorization of synthetic dyes containing indigoid, azo, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane moieties
(Fig 1) at pH 8 and in tap water (pH 6.8) .To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst description for
the use of phenothiazine and N-substituted derivatives as redox mediators for bacterial laccases. Our results
show state-of-the-art decolorization yields using an aordable, scalabe LMS system.

Data may be preliminary.Trametes versicolor laccase was purchased from Sigma (product # 38429), as a lyophilized powder, resus-
pended in 1 ml of McIlvaine's buer at pH 7, and preserved at -20 ¬∫C in aliquots.
Phenothiazine ([?]98%) and acrylonitrile ([?]99%) were from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals are analyt-
ical grade.
Synthesis of phenothiazine derivatives
b-(10-phenothiazyl)-propionitrile (PhCN) was synthesized as described by (Smith, 1950). The reaction
was prepared by mixing phenothiazine and acrylonitrile cooled in an ice-bath and treated with 40% ben-
zyltrimethylamonium hydroxide aqueous solution. The reaction mixture was warmed for one hour and then
allowed to cool. The crystalline solid was recrystallized from acetone.1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl 3):d2.85

Production of recombinant laccases
Recombinant fungal LCC3 from Trametes trogii BAFC463 was produced in Pichia pastoris as previously
described (Campos et al., 2016).
The coding sequence of laccase CotA was amplied from total DNA of Bacillus subtilis ATCC
6633 using oligonucleotides CotFw (5 /acute.ts1-GGATCCATATGACACTTGAAAAATTTG-3 /acute.ts1) and CotRv (5 /acute.ts1-
AAGCTTATTTATGGGGATCAGTTATATC-3 /acute.ts1) and cloned into plasmid pGEMT-easy (Promega) for se-
quencing (Macrogen Korea). For CotA expression, coding sequence was cloned into vector pPICNHIS (Ni-
derhaus et al., 2018), a derivative of plasmid pPIC9 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) in restriction sites Eco-
RI/AvrII to obtain vector pPICNHISCotA (Fig. S1a). Plasmid pPICNHISCotA was linearized with BglII
and used for the transformation of P. pastoris strain SMD1168 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) by electropora-
tion. Recombinant clones expressing and secreting active laccase were revealed by screening colonies showing
green oxidation halos on minimal medium MM plates (0.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 10
g/L (NH 4)2SO4, and 2% agar) supplemented with 2 mM ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-
sulphonate). Production of recombinant CotA was performed in BMMY medium (1% yeast extract, 2%
peptone, 100 mM potassium phosphate buer, pH 6.0, 0.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 10
g/L (NH 4)2SO4, 400 mg/L biotin, 200 mM CuSO 4and 3% sorbitol) as previously described (Campos et al.,
2016).
The coding sequence of laccase SilA from Streptomyces ipomoeae (Genbank Acc number DQ832180) was
synthesized by optimizing the codon usage for E. coli (Genescript) and cloned in EcoRI/NotI restriction sites
into expression vector pHISTEV30a (Fig.S1b) and used for transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3). For SilA
production, transformed E. coli cells were grown in LB broth at 37 ¬∫C containing 100 mg/L kanamycin until
OD600nm = 0.6. Induction was performed by adding 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside)
and 0.5 mM CuSO 4, overnight at 30 ¬∞C and 150 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in
100 mM sodium phosphate buer pH 8, and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was separated from total
proteins by centrifugation.
Purication of recombinant laccases was performed by Ni-NTA anity chromatography as previously des-
cribed (Campos et al., 2016).

No reuse without permission. | https://doi.org/10.22541/au.159819297.75858452 | This a preprint and has not been peer reviewed. Data may be preliminary.Laccase activity was determined by quantication of 5 mM 2,6 dimetoxyphenol (DMP) oxidation at 469 nm
(e= 27.5 mM-1cm-1) in McIlvaine's buer at room temperature at pH 4 or pH 8 for fungal or bacterial
enzymes, respectively. One unit of enzymatic activity was dened as the amount of enzyme transforming 1
mmol of substrate per minute at the indicated pH and temperature.
2.5 Dye decolorization
Decolorization activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at the maximum wavelength
in the visible spectrum of each dye: indigo carmine (Acid Blue 74, 610 nm); xylidine ponceau (Acid Red 26,
497 nm), remazol brilliant blue R (Reactive Blue 19, 590 nm) and malachite green (Basic Green 4, 617 nm)
and expressed as percentage of decolorization respect to control reactions without the addition of enzyme
in the same conditions of pH and temperature. Reactions were performed in triplicates using 50 mM of dye
in McIlvaine's buer at 24 ¬∞C or 50 ¬∞C and laccase nal concentration of 0.1 or 1 UE/mL. Redox mediators,
PhZ, PhCN, and PhCOOH, were used at a ratio of 1:1 (50 mM) or 5:1 (250 mM) with dye.
For successive decolorization cycles, the decrease in the absorbance of 50 mM indigo carmine was determined
in the presence of 50 mM of the dierent redox mediators and 0.1 UE/mL of laccase. After incubations of 1
h, A 610nm was determined, and concentrated dye was added to the reaction to reach the initial concentration
of IC (50 mM).
Full UV-visible absorbance spectroscopic scans (200-800 nm) were carried out using a NanodropTM2000
spectrophotometer for dye-decolorizations reactions after 24 h of incubation of 50 mM of each dye with 1
U/mL of SilA and 250 mM PhCOOH at pH 8 and 24 ¬∞C and control solutions of dyes and PhCOOH without
addition of the enzyme.
2.6 Redox potential of dyes and mediators
Solutions of 50 mM of IC were prepared in McIlvaine's buer at pH 4 and 8, and redox potentials were
determined by cyclic voltammetry at 25 mV/s using a system of three electrodes: glassy carbon, Ag/AgCl
(3 M) and gold as working, reference and counter electrode, respectively. A solution of 50 mM was prepared
for the mediators at the same conditions and with the same system. The redox potential was determined
by dierential pulse voltammetry with 2 mV step size, 0.25 s sample period, 0.05 s pulse time, and 50 mV
pulse size.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Evaluation of redox mediators for indigo carmine decolorization by laccases.
Since phenothiazine and b-(10-phenothiazyl)-propionic acid were previously reported as substrates and redox
mediators for fungal laccases (Camarero et al., 2005; Soares et al., 2001), we decided to evaluate them as
redox mediators for bacterial enzymes. Additionally, we tested b-(10-phenothiazyl)-propionitrile, which is
an intermediate for the synthesis of PhCOOH and was also reported as a fungal laccase substrate (Kulys et
al., 2000).
To test these three synthetic compounds, we rst evaluated the improvement in decolorization of indigo
carmine (IC), a dye commonly used in the textile industry to produce denim fabrics. We used two re-
combinant bacterial laccases with dierent redox potential in T1 Cu, produced in the course of this work:
the three-domain CotA enzyme from Bacillus subtilis (E¬∞= 0.455 V vs. SHE, Dur~ ao et al., 2006)) and the
two-domain small laccase SilA from Streptomyces ipomoeae (E¬∞= 0.337 V vs. SHE, Bl anquez et al., 2019).
The CotA bacterial laccase was cloned from B. subtilis and expressed in P. pastoris . The biochemical
properties of the recombinant enzyme were identical to those previously reported for the enzyme expressed
inE. coli (Martins et al., 2002), being a 65 KDa monomeric protein, showing optimal conditions for the
oxidation of DMP at pH 8.
TheS. ipomoeae laccase SilA was expressed in E. coli using microaerobic conditions. The recombinant enzyme
showed optimal activity at pH 8 for the oxidation of DMP and an apparent molecular weight of 75-80 KDa

In contrast, in the Western blot of SDS-PAGE, only monomeric forms of
39-40 KDa were detected as previously described (Molina-Guijarro et al., 2009).
Decolorization of IC by bacterial laccases showed an increase in the presence of PhCOOH and PhZ, concerning
treatments with the enzyme alone. In the absence of redox mediators, IC decolorization by SilA reached a
19% after 5 h incubation at 24 ¬∞C, while in the presence of PhCOOH or PhZ in a 1:1 ratio with dye, it reached
84% and 55% in less than 1 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, CotA managed to
decolorize 39% of IC after 5 h of incubation in the absence of redox mediators, while in the presence of
PhCOOH, it reached >90% in less than 1 h of incubation. In the presence of PhZ, it showed a maximum
of 75-80% of decolorization after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 2B).
The performance of the LMS using PhCOOH was similar and even higher to the reported for IC decolorization
by CotA and SilA bacterial laccases in the presence of other frequently used redox mediators. Laccase SilA
managed to decolorize 93% to 98% of IC at pH 8 in the presence of the lignin derivatives acetosyringone,
syringaldehyde and methyl syringate but after longer incubation times (24 h) at higher temperature (35 ¬∞C)
and using a higher mediator:dye ratio (2:1) (Bl anquez et al., 2019). Also, previous reports showed 99% of
IC decolorization by B. subtilis CotA after 1 h incubation at pH 7 and 40 ¬∞C in the presence of 100 mM
acetosyringone (Wang and Zhao, 2017).
Regarding the compound PhCN, it did not show any eect on IC decolorization at pH 8 by SilA or CotA. A
possible explanation could be the inhibition of the bacterial laccases by the nitrile moiety, since inhibition by
cyanide has been reported for bacterial enzymes (Molina Guijarro et al., 2009; Endo et al., 2003). However,
no dierences in the decolorization process were observed between reactions with the enzymes alone or in
presence of PhCN (Fig. 2). Therefore, the inability of PhCN to enhance IC decolorization is likely to
be attributed to low kinetics between bacterial enzymes and mediator rather than to an inhibitory eect.
Furthermore, assays performed using medium to high redox potential fungal laccases, showed that PhCN can
function as an ecient redox mediator for IC decolorization by these enzymes. Both PhCN and PhCOOH,
achieved more than 98% of IC decolorization in less than 30 min of incubation at pH 4 with the LcTv enzyme
fromTrametes versicolor and after 1 h of incubation in the presence of the thermostable LCC3 enzyme from
Trametes trogii (Fig. S2).
To test the stability of bacterial laccase-mediator systems, we performed three consecutive cycles of IC
decolorization. Although in the presence of PhZ, IC decolorization decreased by almost 50% after the rst
cycle, reactions in the presence of PhCOOH with CotA or SilA reached the same rates after each cycle (Fig.
3), indicating that this compound practically acts as an ideal mediatior, recovering its redox capacity after
at least 3 cycles of decolorization.
3.2 IC oxidization mechanism mediated by phenothiazine and N-substituted derivatives.
Although bacterial laccases are reported to show lower redox potentials at T1 Cu than fungal enzymes,
here we observed a similar IC decolorization ecacy by both groups of enzymes at their optimal pH in the
presence of PhCOOH and PhZ. The fact that IC redox potential is pH dependant, decreasing its value as
the pH increases, could in part, explain why at acidic pH it is directly oxidized only by fungal enzymes with
medium to high redox potential at T1 Cu (E ¬∞0.46-0.79 V vs. SHE, Mate and Alcalde, 2017) while at pH 8
it is susceptible of oxidation by laccases of bacterial origin showing T1 Cu E ¬∞<0.46 V vs. SHE (Mate and
Alcalde, 2017). However, the decolorization of dyes using a combination of laccase and mediators is a complex
mechanism that cannot be explained by the simple comparison of the formal redox potentials of the T1 Cu
center, the mediator and the dye (Bourbonnais et al., 1998; Zille et al., 2004). The oxidation of phenothiazine
derivatives involves the formation of radical species. The mechanism and the oxidation products depend on
the type of derivative and the pH of the medium (Cheng et al., 1978; Puzanowska-Tarasiewicz et al., 2005).
Similarly to the oxidative mechanism followed by the commonly used redox mediator ABTS (Bourbonnais
et al., 1998), phenothiazines can undergo a two electron process yielding a dication species with a high redox
potential (Blankert et al., 2005) (Fig. 4).
PhZ, PhCN and PhCOOH were characterized by dierential pulse voltammetry, an electrochemical technique

Data may be preliminary.that allows in a simple way to establish the formal potentials of each species at the working conditions (Fig.5).
PhCOOH was the most ecient of the three species since it can mediate the oxidation of indigo carmine
at both pH and with all the laccases. This could be related to the redox potential of the prevalent oxidized
form at each pH: PhCOOH present formal potentials of 0.75 V and 0.68 V vs. SHE for the rst oxidation
process and predominant form at pH 4 and 8, respectively; in both cases close to or even higher than formal
potentials of IC with values of 0.76 V and 0.55 V vs. SHE at pH 4 and 8, respectively.
For PhZ, even though it shows a formal potential of 0.64 V vs. SHE at pH 4, the incubation with the
enzyme generates another colored compound with an absorption peak at 560 nm, that could be related
to the major pathways observed in phenothiazine degradation once is oxidized, limiting its use for dye
decolorization (Sackett et al., 1981). On the other hand, at pH 8 oxidized species with a formal potential of
0.46 V (PhZ+/PhZ) can be formed and then further oxidized by the bacterial laccase generating a stronger
oxidizing species (PhZ2+). Even though the dierence in formal redox potentials between the bacterial
laccases and the PhZ2+/PhZ+couple yields a negative value, the equilibrium for the equation
Lac(ox)+ PhZ+Lac(red) + PhZ2+
can be displaced toward products since the oxygen consume the reduced laccase immediately while the
indigo carmine reacts immediately with the PhZ2+regenerating the reactants. In this way, the Nernst
thermodynamic equation:
E=E0 RT
nFln[PhZ2+][Lac(red)]
[PhZ+][Lac(ox)](eq. 1)
presents a very small ratio between products and reactants; therefore, DE adopts a positive value, and the
reaction spontaneously occurs. A similar mechanism was observed for ABTS in the oxidation of veratryl
alcohol catalyzed by a fungal laccase (Bourbonnais et al., 1998). Finally, PhCN resulted well suited for IC
oxidation at pH 4, but not at pH8. For this compound, it seems that at pH 4 the predominant form is
the second oxidation product with a formal potential of 0.85 V vs. SHE the responsible for IC oxidation.
The redox potential dierence between this mediator (PhCN) and the fungal laccase is around 0.1 V, its
dierence can be reverted by the compound concentrations involved in the reaction (eq. 1).
3.5 Decolorization of azoic, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes by SilA-PhCOOH sys-
tem at pH 8.
Since PhCOOH was the most suitable redox mediator for IC decolorization by bacterial enzymes, we eval-
uated it for the oxidation of remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR, Reactive Blue 19), xylidine ponceau (XYL,
Acid Red 26) and malachite green (MG, Basic Green 4), representing the three main groups of recalcitrant
industrial dyes used worldwide: azoic, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane. Finding ecient methods for
removal of these dyes is of main importance since reductive biotransformation of azo dyes results in the
formation of toxic amines, while the anthraquinone dyes are resistant to degradation due to their fused
aromatic ring structure (Ghaly et al 2014; Shing et al., 2015a). Additionally, oxidation of MG could prevent
its metabolic reduction to leucomalachite, an equally carcinogenic form but with greater persistence in sh
tissues (Hashimoto et al., 2011; Srivastava et al., 2014).
Following the idea of developing a low-cost LMS, we conducted these dye decolorization assays using SilA
laccase. SilA was expressed intracellularly as a soluble protein in E. coli, a well-known, fast and cost-ecient
recombinant protein production platform (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). The active enzyme was recovered
in two simple steps of centrifugation and cell disruption without the need to incorporate any additional
purication, since we observed the same decolorization performance with the enzyme puried by anity
chromatography or with the crude extracts, simplifying the downstream processing.
The decolorization eciency was dierent for each dye, but in all cases it showed an increase in the presence
of PhCOOH and at 50 ¬∞C, according to the optimal temperature range for SilA. Laccase SilA alone was not
able to signicantly decolorize XYL at room temperature, however, it reached a 34% of decolorization after
5 h of incubation at 50 ¬∞C (Fig. 6 a,d). In the presence of PhCOOH an enhancement in decolorization was

Data may be preliminary.observed reaching 86% after 5 h at 50 ¬∞C (Fig. 6d) and 66% after 24 h at room temperature (Fig. 6a), showing
the ability of SilA-PhCOOH LMS to oxidize monoazo XYL. Although decolorization of XYL by dierent
fungal laccases at acidic pH has been reported (Campos et al., 2016; Levin et al., 2005; 2012), there is only
one recent report of oxidation by bacterial enzymes at alkaline pH. Laccase LAC-2.9 from Thermus sp 2.9
manage to decolorize 98% of XYL after 24 h of incubation at pH 9 and 60 ¬∞C, without the addition of redox
mediators (Navas et al., 2020), being an attractive candidate to be evaluated with PhCOOH. On the other
hand, laccase SilA has been successfully used for decolorization of other azoic dyes such as Reactive Black 5
and Orange II (~90% of decolorization after 24 h at pH 8 and 35 ¬∞C) in the presence of 0.1 mM acetosyringone
or methyl syringate as redox mediators, while for Acid Orange 63 o Tartrazine decolorization was not higher
than 22% in the same incubation conditions. Also, in all these cases, the use of syringaldehyde was less
ecient than acetosyringone and methyl syringate (Bl anquez et al., 2019) nsout.
Of the dyes analyzed, RBBR resulted to be the most recalcitrant to degradation by SilA or SilA-PhCOOH.
Less than 20% of decolorization was reached by the SilA alone either at RT or 50 ¬∞C, however in the presence
of PhCOOH it increased to 51% after 24 h at RT and 42% after 5 h at 50 ¬∞C (Fig 6 b,e and Table S1). The
eciency of degradation of this dye by other bacterial laccases and LMS was very variable (Table S1). Small
laccase SLAC from Streptomyces coelicolor reached only 23% of decolorization after 5 h at pH 9 and 45 ¬∞C,
without improvement in the presence of redox mediators (Dub e et al., 2008), while laccases from B. subtilis
cjp3, B. licheniformis LS04 reached almost 100% of decolorization after 6 h of incubation at pH 9 in the
presence of 0.1 mM acetosyringone as redox mediator (Qiao et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2013). On the other hand,
laccases from thermophilic bacteria from Thermus genus showed high decolorization of RBBR even in the
absence of redox mediators (Liu et al., 2015; Navas et al., 2020) (Table S1).
Regarding tryphenylmethane dyes, SilA was highly ecient for decolorization of MG reaching 80% and 93%
after 3 h of incubation at RT with the enzyme alone or in the presence of PhCOOH, respectively (Fig. 6 c).
When incubations were performed at 50 ¬∞C, the nal decolorization percentages were similar to RT, however
the kinetics of the reaction was faster, since more than 80% of decolorization was reached in the rst 30 min
(Fig. 6 f). Although there are many descriptions of MG degradation by microbial reductases or oxidation by
fungal laccases at acidic pH, few describe the oxidation by bacterial laccases. As observed for other dyes, the
decolorization eciency was variable, depending on the enzyme source and the redox mediator used (Table
S1). While the laccase of Klebsiella pneumoniae reached a fast MG decolorization at pH 7.5 and 70 ¬∞C even
in the absence of redox mediators (Lui et al., 2017), laccases from Bacillus vallismortis orBacillus sp. KC2
reached about 80% of MG decolorization only in the presence of ABTS but less than 40% in the presence of
other redox mediators and less than 10% with the enzyme alone (Asadi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2013) .
3.6 Eciency of dye decolorization by SilA-PhCOOH system in tap water at room temperature
In order to evaluate the eciency of SilA-PhCOOH system for dye decolorization in mild conditions, we
performed the treatments in tap water (pH 6.8) at room temperature (24 ¬∞C).
More than 80% of IC decolorization was reached in the rst 5 min of incubation in tap water at 24 ¬∞C in the
presence of PhCOOH (Fig 7a), showing that our system has the potential to be used for IC degradation in
mild conditions. PhCOOH has been reported to be the mediator present in a the commercial formulation
DeniLite ¬Æof Novozymes for bleaching of indigo carmine. Since it is composed of a fungal recombinant
laccase, its use is recommended at pH below 6 and temperatures of 50 ¬∞C (Colomera and Kuilderd, 2015;
Soares et al., 2001), thus, our SilA-PhCOOH system could be an alternative for the biobleaching of denim
fabrics in neutral to alkaline pH conditions. Furthermore, it was reported that the use of laccases could
reduce the undesired eect of re-deposition or backstaining of indigo dye on white yarns after the bio-stone
washing of denim garments with cellulases. Both acid and neutral cellulases are alternatively used for stone
washing, but the combined use of cellulases with laccases functional at neutral pH could contribute to reduce
the problem of backstaining as this process is high at pH 4-6 but signicantly lower at neutral pH (Campos
et al., 2001; Montazer and Sadeghian, 2010).
Regarding MG, 92% decolorization was reached after 5 h of incubation in the presence of PhCOOH (Fig

This result is of remarkable importance since MG is not only used as a dye for silk, leather, and paper,
but also as a parasiticide and antifungal agent in aquaculture (Hashimoto et al., 2011).
For XYL and RBBR a decrease in the decolorization was observed in tap water compared to treatments at
pH 8, however, there was still more than 60% and 50% of decolorization respectively after 24 h of incubation
in mild conditions in the presence of PhCOOH (Fig. 7 c,d).
3.7 UV-visible absorbance spectral analysis of decolorization products.
The proposed mechanisms for the catalytic degradation of XYL, RBBR and MG by laccase involve the
formation of aromatic compounds of lower molecular weight, which can be further degraded by chemical
processes (Levin et al. 2012; Navas et al., 2020; Osma et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2015). As an approach to
conrm this mechanisms in SilA-PhCOOH LMS, we performed full scan of UV-visible absorption spectra of
decolorized reactions after 24 h of incubation. In all of the cases, we observed the disappearance of the main
absorbance peak of each dye due to cleavage of the chromophore, and the increase in the absorbance in the
range of 200 to 400 nm indicating the formation of aromatic compounds of lower molecular weight (Fig S3).
Also, for IC decolorization reactions, the disappearance of the characteristic peak at 610 nm was accompanied
by the increase in the absorption at 250 nm, corresponding to the isatin-5-sulfonic acid released after the
breakage of the C = C double bond in the dye molecule due to the oxidation by de LMS (Kandelbauer et
al., 2008; Wang et al., 2017).
Although these smaller molecules formed after oxidation by the laccase have shown lower toxicity levels than
the dye (Legerska, 2016), further studies are needed to identify the decomposed substances generated by the
SilA-PhCOOH system.
3.8 Comparative costs of redox mediators
Most of reported dye decolorizations by bacterial LMS use ABTS, ASG or syringaldehyde as redox mediators,
while in paper pulp proceses the use of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) is most common, however the costs
of each compound are quite dierent.
Based on the prices by the same supplier (Sigma Aldrich), ABTS and ASG are the most expensive: ABTS
is about 19,600 USD/mol and ASG is USD 3,500 USD/mol. On the other hand we estimated a cost of 150
USD/mol for the synthesis of PhCOOH from PhZ (PhZ: 17USD/mol), using analytical grade materials. This
value is even lower that the cost of the other commonly used redox mediators syringaldehyde (460 USD/mol)
and HBT (230 USD/mol), adjusting to the concept of low-cost mediator (Morozova et al 2007).
Conclusions
The comparative analysis of dye decolorization by laccase and LMS shows the high variation in the eciency
of each system, depending on the source of the enzyme, the redox mediator and the reaction conditions,
highlighting the diculty in predict the oxidation of complex substrates and the need to carry out an
experimental optimization of the systems, according to the main components of each industrial process or
euent to be treated. Our results demonstrate that PhCOOH can be eciently used as redox mediator for IC
oxidation by bacterial laccases at alkaline pH without inhibition of the enzyme or loss of activity in at least 3
decolorization cycles. In particular, the LMS based on SilA-PhCOOH allows the decolorization of recalcitrant
synthetic dyes of indigoid, azo, anthraquinone, and triphenylmethane type in tap water and at pH 8. Low-
cost of PhCOOH synthesis and production of recombinant SilA in E. coli, along with other properties of the
enzyme, such as thermostability and tolerance to high salt concentrations, show the potential of this LMS to
be applied in the removal of dyes in alkaline textile euents, achieving state-of-the-art decolorization yields
(see Table S1). In addition, the SilA-PhCOOH system could be valuable for other industrial processes such
as delignication of alkaline paper pulp, biobleaching of indigo dye and reduction of backstaining in denim
nishing process and for the design of biosensors and biofuel cells functional at alkaline or physiological pH.

Figure captions
Fig. 1. Structures and acronyms of phenothiazine and N-substituted derivatives used as redox mediators
and dyes tested in this work.
Fig. 2. Decolorization of 50 mM Indigo Carmine by of 0.1UE/mL of laccase SilA (A), and CotA (B) was
assayed without mediator (triangles) or the presence of 50 mM PhZ (squares), PhCN (diamonds) or PhCOOH
(circles) at 24 ¬∞C in McIlvaine's buer pH 8. Decolorization is represented as % respect to absorbance at t 0.
Error bars correspond to the standard deviation for triplicates.
Fig. 3. Decolorization of 50 mM Indigo Carmine by of 0.1UE/mL of laccase SilA (a) and CotA (b) in the
presence of 50 mM of each redox mediator at 24 ¬∞C in McIlvaine's buer pH 8. Decolorization reactions
were performed in three consecutive cycles (I, II, III) of 1 h of incubation by adding concentrated fresh
dye solutions to reach initial absorbance at the beginning of each cycle. Decolorization is represented as %
respect to absorbance at t 0. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation for triplicates.
Fig. 4. Oxidation process of phenothiazine derivatives.
Fig. 5. Dierential pulse voltammetries for PhZ (continuous line), PhCN (dashed line) and PhCOOH (dotted
line). Experiments carried out in McIlvaine's buer at pH 4 (a) and pH 8 (b).The vertical lines indicate the
formal potential of IC at the corresponding pH.
Fig. 6 Decolorization of 50 mM XYL (a and d), RBBR (b and e), and MG (c and f) by 1UE/mL of laccase
SilA was assayed in the absence (triangles) or the presence of 250 mM PhCOOH (circles) at 24 ¬∞C (a,b,c) or
50¬∞C (d,e,f) in citrate-phosphate buer pH 8. Decolorization is represented as % respect to absorbance at
t0. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation for triplicates.
Fig. 7. Decolorization of 50 mM IC (a), MG (b), XYL (c) and RBBR (d) by of 1UE/mL of laccase SilA was
assayed in the absence (triangles) or the presence of PhCOOH (circles) at 24 ¬∞C in tap water. Decolorization is
represented as % respect to absorbance at t 0. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation for triplicates.
