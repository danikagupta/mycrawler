In 1969, the International Agency for Research on C ancer (IARC) initiated a programme on the evaluatio n of 
the carcinogenic risk of chemicals to humans involv ing the production of critically evaluated monograp hs on 
individual chemicals. The programme was subsequentl y expanded to include evaluations of carcinogenic r isks 
associated with exposures to complex mixtures, life -style factors and biological and physical agents, as well as those 
in specific occupations. 
The objective of the programme is to elaborate and publish in the form of monographs critical reviews of data 
on carcinogenicity for agents to which humans are k nown to be exposed and on specific exposure situati ons; to 
evaluate these data in terms of human risk with the  help of international working groups of experts in  chemical 
carcinogenesis and related fields; and to indicate where additional research efforts are needed. 
The lists of IARC evaluations are regularly updated  and are available on Internet: http://monographs.

This programme has been supported by Cooperative Ag reement 5UO1CA33193 awarded since 1982 by the 
United States National Cancer Institute, Department  of Health and Human Services. Additional support h as been 
provided since 1986 by the European Commission, Dir ectorate-General EMPL (Employment, and Social Affai rs), 
Health, Safety and Hygiene at Work Unit, and since 1992 by the United States National Institute of Env ironmental 
Health Sciences.

 1 Ethylene oxide is an effective fumigant and sterila nt for microbial 
organisms. It is used to treat hospital equipment, disposable and reusable 
medical items, drugs, packaging materials, scientif ic equipment and 
many other items. 
 2 The largest single use for 1,3-butadiene is in the production of styrene-
butadiene rubber for tyres and tyre products. 
 3 Vinyl chloride is used primarily in the manufacture  of polyvinyl chloride.

NOTE TO THE READER 
 
The term ‘carcinogenic risk’ in the IARC Monographs  series is taken to mean that an 
agent is capable of causing cancer under some circu mstances. The Monographs evaluate 
cancer hazards, despite the historical presence of the word ‘risks’ in the title. 
Inclusion of an agent in the Monographs does not im ply that it is a carcinogen, only 
that the published data have been examined. Equally , the fact that an agent has not yet 
been evaluated in a monograph does not mean that it  is not carcinogenic. 
The evaluations of carcinogenic risk are made by in ternational working groups of 
independent scientists and are qualitative in natur e. No recommendation is given for 
regulation or legislation. 
Anyone who is aware of published data that may alte r the evaluation of the carcino-
genic risk of an agent to humans is encouraged to m ake this information available to the 
Carcinogen Identification and Evaluation Group, Int ernational Agency for Research on 
Cancer, 150 cours Albert Thomas, 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, Franc e, in order that the agent 
may be considered for re-evaluation by a future Wor king Group. 
Although every effort is made to prepare the monogr aphs as accurately as possible, 
mistakes may occur. Readers are requested to communicat e any errors to the Carcinogen 
Identification and Evaluation Group, so that correc tions can be reported in future 
volumes.

1 Dr Bertazzi chairs a department that has a research  contract with Plastics Europe, whose member compan ies 
manufacture the chemicals reviewed at this meeting.  The value of the contract is less than 5% of the d epart-
ment’s research budget.  
2 Dr Coggon has received travel support from the pla stics industry to attend advisory group meetings fo r the 
study disclosed by Dr Bertazzi. Dr Coggon also has received travel support from the chemical industry to 
attend another recent scientific meeting. Neither D r Coggon nor his department received professional c ompen-
sation for these activities.  
3 Dr Eastmond’s laboratory received research support  on a topic unrelated to this meeting from Dow Chem ical 
Company and from Bayer AG (a former subsidiary that  is now Lanxess Corporation). The funds were receiv ed 
in 1997 but not used until recently. The funds do n ot support Dr Eastmond’s salary and comprise less t han 10% 
of the laboratory’s overall funding. Dow Chemical m anufactures or uses 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, and 
vinyl chloride. Lanxess manufactures polybutadiene rubber.  4 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

PREAMBLE  
  
–9– IARC MONOGRAPHS ON THE EVALUATION OF 
CARCINOGENIC RISKS TO HUMANS 
PREAMBLE 
The Preamble to the IARC Monographs  describes the objective and scope of 
the programme, the scientific principles and proced ures used in developing a 
Monograph , the types of evidence considered and the scientif ic criteria that guide 
the evaluations. The Preamble should be consulted wh en reading a Monograph  or 
list of evaluations.  
A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES  
1. Background  
Soon after IARC was established in 1965, it receive d frequent requests for advice on 
the carcinogenic risk of chemicals, including reque sts for lists of known and suspected 
human carcinogens. It was clear that it would not b e a simple task to summarize ade-
quately the complexity of the information that was a vailable, and IARC began to consider 
means of obtaining international expert opinion on this topic. In 1970, the IARC Advisory 
Committee on Environmental Carcinogenesis recommend ed ‘...that a compendium on 
carcinogenic chemicals be prepared by experts. The biological activity and evaluation of 
practical importance to public health should be ref erenced and documented.’ The IARC 
Governing Council adopted a resolution concerning t he role of IARC in providing 
government authorities with expert, independent, sc ientific opinion on environmental 
carcinogenesis. As one means to that end, the Gover ning Council recommended that 
IARC should prepare monographs on the evaluation of  carcinogenic risk of chemicals to 
man, which became the initial title of the series.  
In the succeeding years, the scope of the programme  broadened as Monographs  were 
developed for groups of related chemicals, complex mixtures, occupational exposures, 
physical and biological agents and lifestyle factor s. In 1988, the phrase ‘of chemicals’ was 
dropped from the title, which assumed its present f orm, IARC Monographs on the Eva-
luation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans . 
Through the Monographs  programme, IARC seeks to identify the causes of hu man 
cancer. This is the first step in cancer prevention, which is  needed as much today as when 10 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 IARC was established. The global burden of cancer i s high and continues to increase: the 
annual number of new cases was estimated at 10.1 mi llion in 2000 and is expected to 
reach 15 million by 2020 (Stewart & Kleihues, 2003) . With current trends in demo-
graphics and exposure, the cancer burden has been s hifting from high-resource countries 
to low- and medium-resource countries. As a result of Monographs  evaluations, national 
health agencies have been able, on scientific groun ds, to take measures to reduce human 
exposure to carcinogens in the workplace and in the  environment.  
The criteria established in 1971 to evaluate carcin ogenic risks to humans were 
adopted by the Working Groups whose deliberations r esulted in the first 16 volumes of 
the Monographs  series. Those criteria were subsequently updated b y further ad-hoc 
Advisory Groups (IARC, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982, 1983 , 1987, 1988, 1991; Vainio et al. , 
1992; IARC, 2005, 2006).  
The Preamble is primarily a statement of scientific  principles, rather than a specifica-
tion of working procedures. The procedures through which  a Working Group implements 
these principles are not specified in detail. They usually  involve operations that have been 
established as being effective during previous Monograph  meetings but remain, predomi-
nantly, the prerogative of each individual Working Group.  
2. Objective and scope  
The objective of the programme is to prepare, with the help of international Working 
Groups of experts, and to publish in the form of Monographs , critical reviews and eva-
luations of evidence on the carcinogenicity of a wi de range of human exposures. The 
Monographs  represent the first step in carcinogen risk assessment, whi ch involves exami-
nation of all relevant information in order to asse ss the strength of the available evidence 
that an agent could alter the age-specific incidence  of cancer in humans. The Monographs  
may also indicate where additional research efforts  are needed, specifically when data 
immediately relevant to an evaluation are not avail able.  
In this Preamble, the term ‘agent’ refers to any en tity or circumstance that is subject to 
evaluation in a Monograph . As the scope of the programme has broadened, cate gories of 
agents now include specific chemicals, groups of re lated chemicals, complex mixtures, 
occupational or environmental exposures, cultural o r behavioural practices, biological 
organisms and physical agents. This list of categor ies may expand as causation of, and 
susceptibility to, malignant disease become more fu lly understood. 
A cancer ‘hazard’ is an agent that is capable of ca using cancer under some circum-
stances, while a cancer ‘risk’ is an estimate of th e carcinogenic effects expected from 
exposure to a cancer hazard. The Monographs  are an exercise in evaluating cancer 
hazards, despite the historical presence of the wor d ‘risks’ in the title. The distinction 
between hazard and risk is important, and the Monographs  identify cancer hazards even 
when risks are very low at current exposure levels, because  new uses or unforeseen expo-
sures could engender risks that are significantly h igher.   PREAMBLE 11  
 
 In the Monographs , an agent is termed ‘carcinogenic’ if it is capable of increa sing the 
incidence of malignant neoplasms, reducing their la tency, or increasing their severity or 
multiplicity. The induction of benign neoplasms may  in some circumstances (see Part B, 
Section 3a) contribute to the judgement that the ag ent is carcinogenic. The terms ‘neo-
plasm’ and ‘tumour’ are used interchangeably. 
The Preamble continues the previous usage of the ph rase ‘strength of evidence’ as a 
matter of historical continuity, although it should  be understood that Monographs  
evaluations consider studies that support a finding  of a cancer hazard as well as studies 
that do not. 
Some epidemiological and experimental studies indic ate that different agents may act 
at different stages in the carcinogenic process, an d several different mechanisms may be 
involved. The aim of the Monographs  has been, from their inception, to evaluate eviden ce 
of carcinogenicity at any stage in the carcinogenes is process, independently of the under-
lying mechanisms. Information on mechanisms may, ho wever, be used in making the 
overall evaluation (IARC, 1991; Vainio et al. , 1992; IARC, 2005, 2006; see also Part B, 
Sections 4 and 6). As mechanisms of carcinogenesis are elucidated, IARC convenes 
international scientific conferences to determine w hether a broad-based consensus has 
emerged on how specific mechanistic data can be use d in an evaluation of human carcino-
genicity. The results of such conferences are repor ted in IARC Scientific Publications, 
which, as long as they still reflect the current st ate of scientific knowledge, may guide 
subsequent Working Groups.  
Although the Monographs  have emphasized hazard identification, important i ssues 
may also involve dose–response assessment. In many cases, the same epidemiological 
and experimental studies used to evaluate a cancer hazard can also be used to estimate a 
dose–response relationship. A Monograph  may undertake to estimate dose–response 
relationships within the range of the available epi demiological data, or it may compare the 
dose–response information from experimental and epi demiological studies. In some 
cases, a subsequent publication may be prepared by a separate Working Group with 
expertise in quantitative dose–response assessment.  
The Monographs  are used by national and international authorities  to make risk 
assessments, formulate decisions concerning prevent ive measures, provide effective 
cancer control programmes and decide among alternat ive options for public health 
decisions. The evaluations of IARC Working Groups a re scientific, qualitative judge-
ments on the evidence for or against carcinogenicit y provided by the available data. These 
evaluations represent only one part of the body of information on which public health 
decisions may be based. Public health options vary from one situation to another and from 
country to country and relate to many factors, incl uding different socioeconomic and 
national priorities. Therefore, no recommendation i s given with regard to regulation or 
legislation, which are the responsibility of indivi dual governments or other international 
organizations.  12 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 3. Selection of agents for review  
Agents are selected for review on the basis of two main criteria: (a) there is evidence 
of human exposure and (b) there is some evidence or suspicio n of carcinogenicity. Mixed 
exposures may occur in occupational and environment al settings and as a result of 
individual and cultural habits (such as tobacco smo king and dietary practices). Chemical 
analogues and compounds with biological or physical  characteristics similar to those of 
suspected carcinogens may also be considered, even in the absence of data on a possible 
carcinogenic effect in humans or experimental anima ls.  
The scientific literature is surveyed for published  data relevant to an assessment of 
carcinogenicity. Ad-hoc Advisory Groups convened by I ARC in 1984, 1989, 1991, 1993, 
1998 and 2003 made recommendations as to which agen ts should be evaluated in the 
Monographs  series. Recent recommendations are available on th e Monographs  prog-
ramme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr). IARC may  schedule other agents for review 
as it becomes aware of new scientific information o r as national health agencies identify 
an urgent public health need related to cancer.  
As significant new data become available on an agen t for which a Monograph  exists, 
a re-evaluation may be made at a subsequent meeting , and a new Monograph  published. 
In some cases it may be appropriate to review only the data published since a prior 
evaluation. This can be useful for updating a datab ase, reviewing new data to resolve a 
previously open question or identifying new tumour sites associated with a carcinogenic 
agent. Major changes in an evaluation (e.g. a new c lassification in Group 1 or a deter-
mination that a mechanism does not operate in human s, see Part B, Section 6) are more 
appropriately addressed by a full review.  
4. Data for the Monographs 
Each Monograph  reviews all pertinent epidemiological studies and cancer bioassays 
in experimental animals. Those judged inadequate or  irrelevant to the evaluation may be 
cited but not summarized. If a group of similar stu dies is not reviewed, the reasons are 
indicated.  
Mechanistic and other relevant data are also review ed. A Monograph  does not neces-
sarily cite all the mechanistic literature concerni ng the agent being evaluated (see Part B, 
Section 4). Only those data considered by the Worki ng Group to be relevant to making 
the evaluation are included.  
With regard to epidemiological studies, cancer bioa ssays, and mechanistic and other 
relevant data, only reports that have been publishe d or accepted for publication in the 
openly available scientific literature are reviewed . The same publication requirement 
applies to studies originating from IARC, including  meta-analyses or pooled analyses 
commissioned by IARC in advance of a meeting (see P art B, Section 2c). Data from 
government agency reports that are publicly availab le are also considered. Exceptionally,  PREAMBLE 13  
 
 doctoral theses and other material that are in thei r final form and publicly available may 
be reviewed. 
Exposure data and other information on an agent und er consideration are also re-
viewed. In the sections on chemical and physical pr operties, on analysis, on production 
and use and on occurrence, published and unpublishe d sources of information may be 
considered.  
Inclusion of a study does not imply acceptance of the adequac y of the study design or 
of the analysis and interpretation of the results, and limitations are clearly outlined in 
square brackets at the end of each study descriptio n (see Part B). The reasons for not 
giving further consideration to an individual study  also are indicated in the square 
brackets.  
5. Meeting participants  
Five categories of participant can be present at Monograph  meetings.  
(a) The Working Group is responsible for the critic al reviews and evaluations that 
are developed during the meeting. The tasks of Work ing Group Members are: (i) to 
ascertain that all appropriate data have been colle cted; (ii) to select the data relevant for 
the evaluation on the basis of scientific merit; (i ii) to prepare accurate summaries of the 
data to enable the reader to follow the reasoning o f the Working Group; (iv) to evaluate 
the results of epidemiological and experimental stu dies on cancer; (v) to evaluate data 
relevant to the understanding of mechanisms of carc inogenesis; and (vi) to make an 
overall evaluation of the carcinogenicity of the ex posure to humans. Working Group 
Members generally have published significant resear ch related to the carcinogenicity of 
the agents being reviewed, and IARC uses literature  searches to identify most experts. 
Working Group Members are selected on the basis of (a) knowledge and experience and 
(b) absence of real or apparent conflicts of intere sts. Consideration is also given to 
demographic diversity and balance of scientific fin dings and views.  
(b) Invited Specialists are experts who also have c ritical knowledge and experience 
but have a real or apparent conflict of interests. These experts are invited when necessary 
to assist in the Working Group by contributing thei r unique knowledge and experience 
during subgroup and plenary discussions. They may a lso contribute text on non-
influential issues in the section on exposure, such  as a general description of data on 
production and use (see Part B, Section 1). Invited  Specialists do not serve as meeting 
chair or subgroup chair, draft text that pertains t o the description or interpretation of 
cancer data, or participate in the evaluations.  
(c) Representatives of national and international h ealth agencies often attend 
meetings because their agencies sponsor the programme or a re interested in the subject of 
a meeting. Representatives do not serve as meeting chair  or subgroup chair, draft any part 
of a Monograph,  or participate in the evaluations.  
(d) Observers with relevant scientific credentials may be admitted to a meeting by 
IARC in limited numbers. Attention will be given to  achieving a balance of Observers 14 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 from constituencies with differing perspectives. Th ey are invited to observe the meeting 
and should not attempt to influence it. Observers d o not serve as meeting chair or sub-
group chair, draft any part of a Monograph , or participate in the evaluations. At the meet-
ing, the meeting chair and subgroup chairs may gran t Observers an opportunity to speak, 
generally after they have observed a discussion. Obs ervers agree to respect the Guidelines 
for Observers at IARC Monographs  meetings (available at http://monographs.iarc.fr).  
(e) The IARC Secretariat consists of scientists who  are designated by IARC and who 
have relevant expertise. They serve as rapporteurs and participate in all discussions. When 
requested by the meeting chair or subgroup chair, t hey may also draft text or prepare 
tables and analyses.  
Before an invitation is extended, each potential pa rticipant, including the IARC Secre-
tariat, completes the WHO Declaration of Interests to report financial interests, employ-
ment and consulting, and individual and institution al research support related to the 
subject of the meeting. IARC assesses these interes ts to determine whether there is a 
conflict that warrants some limitation on participa tion. The declarations are updated and 
reviewed again at the opening of the meeting. Inter ests related to the subject of the 
meeting are disclosed to the meeting participants a nd in the published volume (Cogliano 
et al. , 2004).  
The names and principal affiliations of participant s are available on the Monographs  
programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr) appro ximately two months before each 
meeting. It is not acceptable for Observers or thir d parties to contact other participants 
before a meeting or to lobby them at any time. Meeting partici pants are asked to report all 
such contacts to IARC (Cogliano et al. , 2005).  
All participants are listed, with their principal a ffiliations, at the beginning of each 
volume. Each participant who is a Member of a Worki ng Group serves as an individual 
scientist and not as a representative of any organi zation, government or industry.  
6. Working procedures  
A separate Working Group is responsible for develop ing each volume of Mon-
ographs . A volume contains one or more Monographs , which can cover either a single 
agent or several related agents. Approximately one year in advance of the meeting of a 
Working Group, the agents to be reviewed are announ ced on the Monographs  programme 
website (http://monographs.iarc.fr) and participant s are selected by IARC staff in consult-
ation with other experts. Subsequently, relevant bi ological and epidemiological data are 
collected by IARC from recognized sources of inform ation on carcinogenesis, including 
data storage and retrieval systems such as PubMed. Meeting participants who are asked to 
prepare preliminary working papers for specific sec tions are expected to supplement the 
IARC literature searches with their own searches.  
For most chemicals and some complex mixtures, the m ajor collection of data and the 
preparation of working papers for the sections on c hemical and physical properties, on 
analysis, on production and use, and on occurrence are carried out under a separate  PREAMBLE 15  
 
 contract funded by the US National Cancer Institute . Industrial associations, labour unions 
and other knowledgeable organizations may be asked to provide input to the sections on 
production and use, although this involvement is no t required as a general rule. 
Information on production and trade is obtained fro m governmental, trade and market 
research publications and, in some cases, by direct  contact with industries. Separate 
production data on some agents may not be available  for a variety of reasons (e.g. not 
collected or made public in all producing countries , production is small). Information on 
uses may be obtained from published sources but is o ften complemented by direct contact 
with manufacturers. Efforts are made to supplement this  information with data from other 
national and international sources.  
Six months before the meeting, the material obtained i s sent to meeting participants to 
prepare preliminary working papers. The working papers are  compiled by IARC staff and 
sent, prior to the meeting, to Working Group Member s and Invited Specialists for review.  
The Working Group meets at IARC for seven to eight days to dis cuss and finalize the 
texts and to formulate the evaluations. The objecti ves of the meeting are peer review and 
consensus. During the first few days, four subgroup s (covering exposure data, cancer in 
humans, cancer in experimental animals, and mechani stic and other relevant data) review 
the working papers, develop a joint subgroup draft and write summaries. Care is taken to 
ensure that each study summary is written or review ed by someone not associated with 
the study being considered. During the last few day s, the Working Group meets in plen-
ary session to review the subgroup drafts and devel op the evaluations. As a result, the 
entire volume is the joint product of the Working G roup, and there are no individually 
authored sections.  
IARC Working Groups strive to achieve a consensus e valuation. Consensus reflects 
broad agreement among Working Group Members, but no t necessarily unanimity. The 
chair may elect to poll Working Group Members to de termine the diversity of scientific 
opinion on issues where consensus is not readily ap parent.  
After the meeting, the master copy is verified by c onsulting the original literature, 
edited and prepared for publication. The aim is to publish the volume within six months 
of the Working Group meeting. A summary of the outc ome is available on the Mono-
graphs  programme website soon after the meeting.  
B. SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND EVALUATION  
The available studies are summarized by the Working  Group, with particular regard 
to the qualitative aspects discussed below. In gene ral, numerical findings are indicated as 
they appear in the original report; units are conve rted when necessary for easier com-
parison. The Working Group may conduct additional a nalyses of the published data and 
use them in their assessment of the evidence; the r esults of such supplementary analyses 
are given in square brackets. When an important asp ect of a study that directly impinges 16 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 on its interpretation should be brought to the atte ntion of the reader, a Working Group 
comment is given in square brackets. 
The scope of the IARC Monographs  programme has expanded beyond chemicals to 
include complex mixtures, occupational exposures, p hysical and biological agents, life-
style factors and other potentially carcinogenic ex posures. Over time, the structure of a 
Monograph  has evolved to include the following sections: 
 1. Exposure data 
 2. Studies of cancer in humans 
 3. Studies of cancer in experimental animals 
 4. Mechanistic and other relevant data 
 5. Summary 
 6. Evaluation and rationale 
In addition, a section of General Remarks at the fr ont of the volume discusses the 
reasons the agents were scheduled for evaluation and  some key issues the Working Group 
encountered during the meeting. 
This part of the Preamble discusses the types of evidence co nsidered and summarized 
in each section of a Monograph , followed by the scientific criteria that guide th e eval-
uations. 
1. Exposure data  
Each Monograph  includes general information on the agent: this in formation may 
vary substantially between agents and must be adapt ed accordingly. Also included is 
information on production and use (when appropriate ), methods of analysis and detection, 
occurrence, and sources and routes of human occupat ional and environmental exposures. 
Depending on the agent, regulations and guidelines for use may be presented. 
(a) General information on the agent  
For chemical agents, sections on chemical and physi cal data are included: the 
Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number, the lat est primary name and the IUPAC 
systematic name are recorded; other synonyms are gi ven, but the list is not necessarily 
comprehensive. Information on chemical and physical  properties that are relevant to 
identification, occurrence and biological activity is included. A description of technical 
products of chemicals includes trade names, relevan t specifications and available in-
formation on composition and impurities. Some of the trade n ames given may be those of 
mixtures in which the agent being evaluated is only  one of the ingredients. 
For biological agents, taxonomy, structure and biol ogy are described, and the degree 
of variability is indicated. Mode of replication, life cycl e, target cells, persistence, latency, 
host response and clinical disease other than cance r are also presented. 
For physical agents that are forms of radiation, en ergy and range of the radiation are 
included. For foreign bodies, fibres and respirable  particles, size range and relative dimen-
sions are indicated.  PREAMBLE 17  
 
 For agents such as mixtures, drugs or lifestyle fac tors, a description of the agent, 
including its composition, is given. 
Whenever appropriate, other information, such as hi storical perspectives or the 
description of an industry or habit, may be include d. 
(b) Analysis and detection 
An overview of methods of analysis and detection of the agen t is presented, including 
their sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility.  Methods widely used for regulatory 
purposes are emphasized. Methods for monitoring hum an exposure are also given. No 
critical evaluation or recommendation of any method  is meant or implied.  
(c) Production and use 
The dates of first synthesis and of first commercia l production of a chemical, mixture 
or other agent are provided when available; for age nts that do not occur naturally, this 
information may allow a reasonable estimate to be m ade of the date before which no 
human exposure to the agent could have occurred. Th e dates of first reported occurrence 
of an exposure are also provided when available. In  addition, methods of synthesis used in 
past and present commercial production and differen t methods of production, which may 
give rise to different impurities, are described.  
The countries where companies report production of the agent, and the number of 
companies in each country, are identified. Availabl e data on production, international 
trade and uses are obtained for representative regi ons. It should not, however, be inferred 
that those areas or nations are necessarily the sol e or major sources or users of the agent. 
Some identified uses may not be current or major ap plications, and the coverage is not 
necessarily comprehensive. In the case of drugs, me ntion of their therapeutic uses does 
not necessarily represent current practice nor does  it imply judgement as to their 
therapeutic efficacy.  
(d) Occurrence and exposure  
Information on the occurrence of an agent in the en vironment is obtained from data 
derived from the monitoring and surveillance of lev els in occupational environments, air, 
water, soil, plants, foods and animal and human tis sues. When available, data on the 
generation, persistence and bioaccumulation of the agent are also included. Such data may 
be available from national databases. 
Data that indicate the extent of past and present h uman exposure, the sources of 
exposure, the people most likely to be exposed and the factors that contribute to the 
exposure are reported. Information is presented on the range of human exposure, in-
cluding occupational and environmental exposures. T his includes relevant findings from 
both developed and developing countries. Some of th ese data are not distributed widely 
and may be available from government reports and other so urces. In the case of mixtures, 
industries, occupations or processes, information i s given about all agents known to be 18 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 present. For processes, industries and occupations,  a historical description is also given, 
noting variations in chemical composition, physical  properties and levels of occupational 
exposure with date and place. For biological agents , the epidemiology of infection is 
described.  
(e) Regulations and guidelines 
Statements concerning regulations and guidelines (e .g. occupational exposure limits, 
maximal levels permitted in foods and water, pestic ide registrations) are included, but 
they may not reflect the most recent situation, since  such limits are continuously reviewed 
and modified. The absence of information on regulato ry status for a country should not be 
taken to imply that that country does not have regu lations with regard to the exposure. For 
biological agents, legislation and control, includi ng vaccination and therapy, are de-
scribed.  
2. Studies of cancer in humans  
This section includes all pertinent epidemiological  studies (see Part A, Section 4). 
Studies of biomarkers are included when they are re levant to an evaluation of carcino-
genicity to humans.  
(a) Types of study considered 
Several types of epidemiological study contribute t o the assessment of carcinogenicity 
in humans — cohort studies, case–control studies, c orrelation (or ecological) studies and 
intervention studies. Rarely, results from randomized  trials may be available. Case reports 
and case series of cancer in humans may also be rev iewed.  
Cohort and case–control studies relate individual e xposures under study to the 
occurrence of cancer in individuals and provide an estimate of effect (such as relative 
risk) as the main measure of association. Intervent ion studies may provide strong 
evidence for making causal inferences, as exemplifi ed by cessation of smoking and the 
subsequent decrease in risk for lung cancer.  
In correlation studies, the units of investigation are usually whole populations (e.g. in 
particular geographical areas or at particular time s), and cancer frequency is related to a 
summary measure of the exposure of the population t o the agent under study. In cor-
relation studies, individual exposure is not docume nted, which renders this kind of study 
more prone to confounding. In some circumstances, h owever, correlation studies may be 
more informative than analytical study designs (see , for example, the Monograph  on 
arsenic in drinking-water; IARC, 2004). 
In some instances, case reports and case series hav e provided important information 
about the carcinogenicity of an agent. These types of study generally arise from a sus-
picion, based on clinical experience, that the conc urrence of two events — that is, a 
particular exposure and occurrence of a cancer — ha s happened rather more frequently  PREAMBLE 19  
 
 than would be expected by chance. Case reports and case series usually lack complete 
ascertainment of cases in any population, definitio n or enumeration of the population at 
risk and estimation of the expected number of cases  in the absence of exposure.  
The uncertainties that surround the interpretation of case reports, case series and 
correlation studies make them inadequate, except in  rare instances, to form the sole basis 
for inferring a causal relationship. When taken tog ether with case–control and cohort 
studies, however, these types of study may add mate rially to the judgement that a causal 
relationship exists.  
Epidemiological studies of benign neoplasms, presum ed preneoplastic lesions and 
other end-points thought to be relevant to cancer a re also reviewed. They may, in some 
instances, strengthen inferences drawn from studies  of cancer itself.  
(b) Quality of studies considered 
It is necessary to take into account the possible r oles of bias, confounding and chance 
in the interpretation of epidemiological studies. B ias is the effect of factors in study design 
or execution that lead erroneously to a stronger or  weaker association than in fact exists 
between an agent and disease. Confounding is a form  of bias that occurs when the 
relationship with disease is made to appear stronger  or weaker than it truly is as a result of 
an association between the apparent causal factor a nd another factor that is associated 
with either an increase or decrease in the incidenc e of the disease. The role of chance is 
related to biological variability and the influence  of sample size on the precision of esti-
mates of effect. 
In evaluating the extent to which these factors hav e been minimized in an individual 
study, consideration is given to a number of aspects of design and analysis as described in 
the report of the study. For example, when suspicio n of carcinogenicity arises largely 
from a single small study, careful consideration is  given when interpreting subsequent 
studies that included these data in an enlarged pop ulation. Most of these considerations 
apply equally to case–control, cohort and correlati on studies. Lack of clarity of any of 
these aspects in the reporting of a study can decre ase its credibility and the weight given 
to it in the final evaluation of the exposure.  
Firstly, the study population, disease (or diseases ) and exposure should have been 
well defined by the authors. Cases of disease in th e study population should have been 
identified in a way that was independent of the exp osure of interest, and exposure should 
have been assessed in a way that was not related to  disease status.  
Secondly, the authors should have taken into accoun t — in the study design and 
analysis — other variables that can influence the r isk of disease and may have been 
related to the exposure of interest. Potential conf ounding by such variables should have 
been dealt with either in the design of the study, such as by matching, or in the analysis, 
by statistical adjustment. In cohort studies, comparison s with local rates of disease may or 
may not be more appropriate than those with nationa l rates. Internal comparisons of 
frequency of disease among individuals at different  levels of exposure are also desirable 20 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 in cohort studies, since they minimize the potentia l for confounding related to the differ-
ence in risk factors between an external reference group and the study population.  
Thirdly, the authors should have reported the basic  data on which the conclusions are 
founded, even if sophisticated statistical analyses  were employed. At the very least, they 
should have given the numbers of exposed and unexpo sed cases and controls in a case–
control study and the numbers of cases observed and  expected in a cohort study. Further 
tabulations by time since exposure began and other temporal factors are also important. In 
a cohort study, data on all cancer sites and all ca uses of death should have been given, to 
reveal the possibility of reporting bias. In a case –control study, the effects of investigated 
factors other than the exposure of interest should have been reported.  
Finally, the statistical methods used to obtain est imates of relative risk, absolute rates 
of cancer, confidence intervals and significance te sts, and to adjust for confounding 
should have been clearly stated by the authors. The se methods have been reviewed for 
case–control studies (Breslow & Day, 1980) and for cohort studies (Breslow & Day, 
1987).  
(c) Meta-analyses and pooled analyses 
Independent epidemiological studies of the same age nt may lead to results that are 
difficult to interpret. Combined analyses of data f rom multiple studies are a means of 
resolving this ambiguity, and well-conducted analys es can be considered. There are two 
types of combined analysis. The first involves comb ining summary statistics such as 
relative risks from individual studies (meta-analys is) and the second involves a pooled 
analysis of the raw data from the individual studie s (pooled analysis) (Greenland, 1998).  
The advantages of combined analyses are increased pr ecision due to increased sample 
size and the opportunity to explore potential confo unders, interactions and modifying 
effects that may explain heterogeneity among studie s in more detail. A disadvantage of 
combined analyses is the possible lack of compatibi lity of data from various studies due 
to differences in subject recruitment, procedures o f data collection, methods of measure-
ment and effects of unmeasured co-variates that may  differ among studies. Despite these 
limitations, well-conducted combined analyses may provi de a firmer basis than individual 
studies for drawing conclusions about the potential  carcinogenicity of agents.  
IARC may commission a meta-analysis or pooled analy sis that is pertinent to a 
particular Monograph  (see Part A, Section 4). Additionally, as a means of gaining insight 
from the results of multiple individual studies, ad- hoc calculations that combine data from 
different studies may be conducted by the Working G roup during the course of a Mono-
graph  meeting. The results of such original calculations , which would be specified in the 
text by presentation in square brackets, might invo lve updates of previously conducted 
analyses that incorporate the results of more recen t studies or de-novo analyses. 
Irrespective of the source of data for the meta-ana lyses and pooled analyses, it is im-
portant that the same criteria for data quality be applied as those that would be applied to 
individual studies and to ensure also that sources of heterogeneity between studies be 
taken into account.  PREAMBLE 21  
 
 (d) Temporal effects 
Detailed analyses of both relative and absolute ris ks in relation to temporal variables, 
such as age at first exposure, time since first exp osure, duration of exposure, cumulative 
exposure, peak exposure (when appropriate) and time  since cessation of exposure, are 
reviewed and summarized when available. Analyses of  temporal relationships may be 
useful in making causal inferences. In addition, su ch analyses may suggest whether a 
carcinogen acts early or late in the process of carcinogene sis, although, at best, they allow 
only indirect inferences about mechanisms of carcin ogenesis.  
(e) Use of biomarkers in epidemiological studies 
Biomarkers indicate molecular, cellular or other bi ological changes and are increas-
ingly used in epidemiological studies for various p urposes (IARC, 1991; Vainio et al. , 
1992; Toniolo et al. , 1997; Vineis et al. , 1999; Buffler et al. , 2004). These may include 
evidence of exposure, of early effects, of cellular , tissue or organism responses, of indi-
vidual susceptibility or host responses, and infere nce of a mechanism (see Part B, Section 
4b). This is a rapidly evolving field that encompas ses developments in genomics, epi-
genomics and other emerging technologies.  
Molecular epidemiological data that identify associ ations between genetic poly-
morphisms and interindividual differences in suscep tibility to the agent(s) being evaluated 
may contribute to the identification of carcinogeni c hazards to humans. If the poly-
morphism has been demonstrated experimentally to mo dify the functional activity of the 
gene product in a manner that is consistent with in creased susceptibility, these data may 
be useful in making causal inferences. Similarly, m olecular epidemiological studies that 
measure cell functions, enzymes or metabolites that  are thought to be the basis of 
susceptibility may provide evidence that reinforces  biological plausibility. It should be 
noted, however, that when data on genetic susceptib ility originate from multiple com-
parisons that arise from subgroup analyses, this ca n generate false-positive results and 
inconsistencies across studies, and such data there fore require careful evaluation. If the 
known phenotype of a genetic polymorphism can expla in the carcinogenic mechanism of 
the agent being evaluated, data on this phenotype m ay be useful in making causal infer-
ences.  
(f) Criteria for causality 
After the quality of individual epidemiological stu dies of cancer has been summarized 
and assessed, a judgement is made concerning the st rength of evidence that the agent in 
question is carcinogenic to humans. In making its j udgement, the Working Group con-
siders several criteria for causality (Hill, 1965).  A strong association (e.g. a large relative 
risk) is more likely to indicate causality than a weak asso ciation, although it is recognized 
that estimates of effect of small magnitude do not imply lack of causality and may be 
important if the disease or exposure is common. Ass ociations that are replicated in several 
studies of the same design or that use different ep idemiological approaches or under 22 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 different circumstances of exposure are more likely to re present a causal relationship than 
isolated observations from single studies. If there  are inconsistent results among investig-
ations, possible reasons are sought (such as differ ences in exposure), and results of studies 
that are judged to be of high quality are given mor e weight than those of studies that are 
judged to be methodologically less sound.  
If the risk increases with the exposure, this is co nsidered to be a strong indication of 
causality, although the absence of a graded respons e is not necessarily evidence against a 
causal relationship. The demonstration of a decline  in risk after cessation of or reduction 
in exposure in individuals or in whole populations also supports a causal interpretation of 
the findings.  
A number of scenarios may increase confidence in a causal relationship. On the one 
hand, an agent may be specific in causing tumours a t one site or of one morphological 
type. On the other, carcinogenicity may be evident through the causation of multiple 
tumour types. Temporality, precision of estimates of effe ct, biological plausibility and co-
herence of the overall database are considered. Dat a on biomarkers may be employed in 
an assessment of the biological plausibility of epi demiological observations.  
Although rarely available, results from randomized trials that show different rates of 
cancer among exposed and unexposed individuals prov ide particularly strong evidence 
for causality.  
When several epidemiological studies show little or  no indication of an association 
between an exposure and cancer, a judgement may be made that, in the aggregate, they 
show evidence of lack of carcinogenicity. Such a ju dgement requires firstly that the 
studies meet, to a sufficient degree, the standards  of design and analysis described above. 
Specifically, the possibility that bias, confounding or m isclassification of exposure or out-
come could explain the observed results should be c onsidered and excluded with 
reasonable certainty. In addition, all studies that  are judged to be methodologically sound 
should (a) be consistent with an estimate of effect  of unity for any observed level of 
exposure, (b) when considered together, provide a p ooled estimate of relative risk that is 
at or near to unity, and (c) have a narrow confiden ce interval, due to sufficient population 
size. Moreover, no individual study nor the pooled results of all the studies should show 
any consistent tendency that the relative risk of c ancer increases with increasing level of 
exposure. It is important to note that evidence of lack of carcinogenicity obtained from 
several epidemiological studies can apply only to t he type(s) of cancer studied, to the dose 
levels reported, and to the intervals between first  exposure and disease onset observed in 
these studies. Experience with human cancer indicat es that the period from first exposure 
to the development of clinical cancer is sometimes longer than 20 years; latent periods 
substantially shorter than 30 years cannot provide evidence for lack of carcinogenicity. 
3. Studies of cancer in experimental animals 
All known human carcinogens that have been studied adequately for carcinogenicity 
in experimental animals have produced positive resu lts in one or more animal species  PREAMBLE 23  
 
 (Wilbourn et al. , 1986; Tomatis et al. , 1989). For several agents (e.g. aflatoxins, dieth yl-
stilbestrol, solar radiation, vinyl chloride), carc inogenicity in experimental animals was 
established or highly suspected before epidemiologi cal studies confirmed their carcino-
genicity in humans (Vainio et al. , 1995). Although this association cannot establish  that 
all agents that cause cancer in experimental animal s also cause cancer in humans, it is 
biologically plausible that agents for which there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  
in experimental animals (see Part B, Section 6b) al so present a carcinogenic hazard to 
humans. Accordingly, in the absence of additional s cientific information, these agents are 
considered to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans.  Examples of additional scientific 
information are data that demonstrate that a given agent causes cancer in animals through 
a species-specific mechanism that does not operate in humans or data that demonstrate 
that the mechanism in experimental animals also ope rates in humans (see Part B, Section 
6). 
Consideration is given to all available long-term s tudies of cancer in experimental 
animals with the agent under review (see Part A, Se ction 4). In all experimental settings, 
the nature and extent of impurities or contaminants  present in the agent being evaluated 
are given when available. Animal species, strain (i ncluding genetic background where 
applicable), sex, numbers per group, age at start o f treatment, route of exposure, dose 
levels, duration of exposure, survival and informat ion on tumours (incidence, latency, 
severity or multiplicity of neoplasms or preneoplas tic lesions) are reported. Those studies 
in experimental animals that are judged to be irrel evant to the evaluation or judged to be 
inadequate (e.g. too short a duration, too few anim als, poor survival; see below) may be 
omitted. Guidelines for conducting long-term carcin ogenicity experiments have been 
published (e.g. OECD, 2002). 
Other studies considered may include: experiments i n which the agent was adminis-
tered in the presence of factors that modify carcinogenic ef fects (e.g. initiation–promotion 
studies, co-carcinogenicity studies and studies in genet ically modified animals); studies in 
which the end-point was not cancer but a defined pre cancerous lesion; experiments on the 
carcinogenicity of known metabolites and derivative s; and studies of cancer in non-
laboratory animals (e.g. livestock and companion an imals) exposed to the agent. 
For studies of mixtures, consideration is given to the possibility that changes in the 
physicochemical properties of the individual substa nces may occur during collection, 
storage, extraction, concentration and delivery. An other consideration is that chemical and 
toxicological interactions of components in a mixtu re may alter dose–response relation-
ships. The relevance to human exposure of the test mixture administered in the animal 
experiment is also assessed. This may involve consi deration of the following aspects of 
the mixture tested: (i) physical and chemical chara cteristics, (ii) identified constituents 
that may indicate the presence of a class of substa nces and (iii) the results of genetic 
toxicity and related tests. 
The relevance of results obtained with an agent tha t is analogous (e.g. similar in 
structure or of a similar virus genus) to that bein g evaluated is also considered. Such 
results may provide biological and mechanistic info rmation that is relevant to the 24 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 understanding of the process of carcinogenesis in h umans and may strengthen the bio-
logical plausibility that the agent being evaluated  is carcinogenic to humans (see Part B, 
Section 2f). 
(a) Qualitative aspects 
An assessment of carcinogenicity involves several c onsiderations of qualitative im-
portance, including (i) the experimental conditions  under which the test was performed, 
including route, schedule and duration of exposure,  species, strain (including genetic 
background where applicable), sex, age and duration  of follow-up; (ii) the consistency of 
the results, for example, across species and target  organ(s); (iii) the spectrum of neoplastic 
response, from preneoplastic lesions and benign tum ours to malignant neoplasms; and 
(iv) the possible role of modifying factors. 
Considerations of importance in the interpretation and eva luation of a particular study 
include: (i) how clearly the agent was defined and,  in the case of mixtures, how 
adequately the sample characterization was reported ; (ii) whether the dose was monitored 
adequately, particularly in inhalation experiments;  (iii) whether the doses, duration of 
treatment and route of exposure were appropriate; ( iv) whether the survival of treated 
animals was similar to that of controls; (v) whethe r there were adequate numbers of 
animals per group; (vi) whether both male and femal e animals were used; (vii) whether 
animals were allocated randomly to groups; (viii) w hether the duration of observation was 
adequate; and (ix) whether the data were reported a nd analysed adequately. 
When benign tumours (a) occur together with and ori ginate from the same cell type as 
malignant tumours in an organ or tissue in a partic ular study and (b) appear to represent a 
stage in the progression to malignancy, they are us ually combined in the assessment of 
tumour incidence (Huff et al. , 1989). The occurrence of lesions presumed to be p re-
neoplastic may in certain instances aid in assessin g the biological plausibility of any 
neoplastic response observed. If an agent induces on ly benign neoplasms that appear to be 
end-points that do not readily undergo transition t o malignancy, the agent should never-
theless be suspected of being carcinogenic and requ ires further investigation. 
(b) Quantitative aspects  
The probability that tumours will occur may depend on the species, sex, strain, 
genetic background and age of the animal, and on th e dose, route, timing and duration of 
the exposure. Evidence of an increased incidence of  neoplasms with increasing levels of 
exposure strengthens the inference of a causal asso ciation between the exposure and the 
development of neoplasms. 
The form of the dose–response relationship can vary  widely, depending on the 
particular agent under study and the target organ. Mechanisms such as induction of DNA 
damage or inhibition of repair, altered cell divisi on and cell death rates and changes in 
intercellular communication are important determina nts of dose–response relationships 
for some carcinogens. Since many chemicals require metabolic activation before being  PREAMBLE 25  
 
 converted to their reactive intermediates, both met abolic and toxicokinetic aspects are 
important in determining the dose–response pattern.  Saturation of steps such as 
absorption, activation, inactivation and eliminatio n may produce non-linearity in the 
dose–response relationship (Hoel et al. , 1983; Gart et al. , 1986), as could saturation of 
processes such as DNA repair. The dose–response rel ationship can also be affected by 
differences in survival among the treatment groups.  
(c) Statistical analyses 
Factors considered include the adequacy of the info rmation given for each treatment 
group: (i) number of animals studied and number exa mined histologically, (ii) number of 
animals with a given tumour type and (iii) length of survival . The statistical methods used 
should be clearly stated and should be the generall y accepted techniques refined for this 
purpose (Peto et al. , 1980; Gart et al. , 1986; Portier & Bailer, 1989; Bieler & Williams, 
1993). The choice of the most appropriate statistic al method requires consideration of 
whether or not there are differences in survival am ong the treatment groups; for example, 
reduced survival because of non-tumour-related mort ality can preclude the occurrence of 
tumours later in life. When detailed information on  survival is not available, comparisons 
of the proportions of tumour-bearing animals among the effective number of animals 
(alive at the time the first tumour was discovered)  can be useful when significant differ-
ences in survival occur before tumours appear. The lethality of the tumour also requires 
consideration: for rapidly fatal tumours, the time of death provides an indication of the 
time of tumour onset and can be assessed using life -table methods; non-fatal or incidental 
tumours that do not affect survival can be assessed  using methods such as the Mantel-
Haenzel test for changes in tumour prevalence. Beca use tumour lethality is often difficult 
to determine, methods such as the Poly-K test that do not require such information can 
also be used. When results are available on the num ber and size of tumours seen in 
experimental animals (e.g. papillomas on mouse skin , liver tumours observed through 
nuclear magnetic resonance tomography), other more complicated statistical procedures 
may be needed (Sherman et al. , 1994; Dunson et al. , 2003). 
Formal statistical methods have been developed to i ncorporate historical control data 
into the analysis of data from a given experiment. These methods assign an appropriate 
weight to historical and concurrent controls on the  basis of the extent of between-study 
and within-study variability: less weight is given to historical controls when they show a 
high degree of variability, and greater weight when  they show little variability. It is 
generally not appropriate to discount a tumour resp onse that is significantly increased 
compared with concurrent controls by arguing that i t falls within the range of historical 
controls, particularly when historical controls sho w high between-study variability and 
are, thus, of little relevance to the current exper iment. In analysing results for uncommon 
tumours, however, the analysis may be improved by c onsidering historical control data, 
particularly when between-study variability is low.  Historical controls should be selected 
to resemble the concurrent controls as closely as p ossible with respect to species, gender 26 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 and strain, as well as other factors such as basal diet and general laboratory environment, 
which may affect tumour-response rates in control a nimals (Haseman et al. , 1984; Fung et 
al. , 1996; Greim et al. , 2003). 
Although meta-analyses and combined analyses are co nducted less frequently for 
animal experiments than for epidemiological studies  due to differences in animal strains, 
they can be useful aids in interpreting animal data  when the experimental protocols are 
sufficiently similar. 
4. Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Mechanistic and other relevant data may provide evide nce of carcinogenicity and also 
help in assessing the relevance and importance of f indings of cancer in animals and in 
humans. The nature of the mechanistic and other rel evant data depends on the biological 
activity of the agent being considered. The Working  Group considers representative 
studies to give a concise description of the releva nt data and issues that they consider to 
be important; thus, not every available study is ci ted. Relevant topics may include toxico-
kinetics, mechanisms of carcinogenesis, susceptible  individuals, populations and life-
stages, other relevant data and other adverse effec ts. When data on biomarkers are in-
formative about the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, t hey are included in this section. 
These topics are not mutually exclusive; thus, the same studies may be discussed in 
more than one subsection. For example, a mutation i n a gene that codes for an enzyme 
that metabolizes the agent under study could be dis cussed in the subsections on toxico-
kinetics, mechanisms and individual susceptibility if it also exists as an inherited poly-
morphism. 
(a) Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics refers to the absorption, distributi on, metabolism and elimination of 
agents in humans, experimental animals and, where r elevant, cellular systems. Examples 
of kinetic factors that may affect dose–response re lationships include uptake, deposition, 
biopersistence and half-life in tissues, protein bi nding, metabolic activation and de-
toxification. Studies that indicate the metabolic f ate of the agent in humans and in experi-
mental animals are summarized briefly, and comparis ons of data from humans and 
animals are made when possible. Comparative informa tion on the relationship between 
exposure and the dose that reaches the target site may be important for the extrapolation 
of hazards between species and in clarifying the ro le of in-vitro findings. 
(b) Data on mechanisms of carcinogenesis 
To provide focus, the Working Group attempts to ide ntify the possible mechanisms 
by which the agent may increase the risk of cancer.  For each possible mechanism, a 
representative selection of key data from humans an d experimental systems is sum-
marized. Attention is given to gaps in the data and  to data that suggests that more than one  PREAMBLE 27  
 
 mechanism may be operating. The relevance of the mech anism to humans is discussed, in 
particular, when mechanistic data are derived from experi mental model systems. Changes 
in the affected organs, tissues or cells can be div ided into three non-exclusive levels as 
described below. 
(i) Changes in physiology  
Physiological changes refer to exposure-related mod ifications to the physiology 
and/or response of cells, tissues and organs. Examp les of potentially adverse 
physiological changes include mitogenesis, compensa tory cell division, escape from 
apoptosis and/or senescence, presence of inflammati on, hyperplasia, metaplasia 
and/or preneoplasia, angiogenesis, alterations in c ellular adhesion, changes in 
steroidal hormones and changes in immune surveillan ce. 
(ii) Functional changes at the cellular level 
Functional changes refer to exposure-related altera tions in the signalling 
pathways used by cells to manage critical processes  that are related to increased risk 
for cancer. Examples of functional changes include modified activities of enzymes 
involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, alterati ons in the expression of key genes 
that regulate DNA repair, alterations in cyclin-dep endent kinases that govern cell 
cycle progression, changes in the patterns of post- translational modifications of 
proteins, changes in regulatory factors that alter apoptotic rates, changes in the 
secretion of factors related to the stimulation of DNA replication and transcription 
and changes in gap–junction-mediated intercellular communication. 
(iii) Changes at the molecular level 
Molecular changes refer to exposure-related changes  in key cellular structures at 
the molecular level, including, in particular, geno toxicity. Examples of molecular 
changes include formation of DNA adducts and DNA st rand breaks, mutations in 
genes, chromosomal aberrations, aneuploidy and chan ges in DNA methylation 
patterns. Greater emphasis is given to irreversible  effects. 
The use of mechanistic data in the identification o f a carcinogenic hazard is specific to 
the mechanism being addressed and is not readily de scribed for every possible level and 
mechanism discussed above. 
Genotoxicity data are discussed here to illustrate the key issues involved in the eval-
uation of mechanistic data. 
Tests for genetic and related effects are described  in view of the relevance of 
gene mutation and chromosomal aberration/aneuploidy  to carcinogenesis (Vainio 
et al ., 1992; McGregor et al ., 1999). The adequacy of the reporting of sample 
characterization is considered and, when necessary,  commented upon; with 
regard to complex mixtures, such comments are simil ar to those described for 
animal carcinogenicity tests. The available data ar e interpreted critically accord-
ing to the end-points detected, which may include D NA damage, gene mutation, 28 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 sister chromatid exchange, micronucleus formation, chromosomal aberrations and 
aneuploidy. The concentrations employed are given, and mention is made of 
whether the use of an exogenous metabolic system in vitro  affected the test result. 
These data are listed in tabular form by phylogenet ic classification. 
Positive results in tests using prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes, insects, plants 
and cultured mammalian cells suggest that genetic and rel ated effects could occur 
in mammals. Results from such tests may also give i nformation on the types of 
genetic effect produced and on the involvement of m etabolic activation. Some 
end-points described are clearly genetic in nature (e.g. gene mutations), while 
others are associated with genetic effects (e.g. un scheduled DNA synthesis). In-
vitro tests for tumour promotion, cell transformati on and gap–junction inter-
cellular communication may be sensitive to changes that are not necessarily the 
result of genetic alterations but that may have spe cific relevance to the process of 
carcinogenesis. Critical appraisals of these tests have been published (Montesano 
et al ., 1986; McGregor et al ., 1999). 
Genetic or other activity manifest in humans and ex perimental mammals is 
regarded to be of greater relevance than that in ot her organisms. The demon-
stration that an agent can induce gene and chromoso mal mutations in mammals in 
vivo indicates that it may have carcinogenic activity. N egative results in tests for 
mutagenicity in selected tissues from animals treat ed in vivo provide less weight, 
partly because they do not exclude the possibility of an effe ct in tissues other than 
those examined. Moreover, negative results in short -term tests with genetic end-
points cannot be considered to provide evidence tha t rules out the carcinogenicity 
of agents that act through other mechanisms (e.g. r eceptor-mediated effects, 
cellular toxicity with regenerative cell division, peroxisome proliferation) (Vainio 
et al ., 1992). Factors that may give misleading results in short-term tests have 
been discussed in detail elsewhere (Montesano et al ., 1986; McGregor et al ., 
1999). 
When there is evidence that an agent acts by a spec ific mechanism that does not 
involve genotoxicity (e.g. hormonal dysregulation, i mmune suppression, and formation of 
calculi and other deposits that cause chronic irrit ation), that evidence is presented and 
reviewed critically in the context of rigorous crit eria for the operation of that mechanism 
in carcinogenesis (e.g. Capen et al. , 1999). 
For biological agents such as viruses, bacteria and  parasites, other data relevant to 
carcinogenicity may include descriptions of the pat hology of infection, integration and 
expression of viruses, and genetic alterations seen  in human tumours. Other observations 
that might comprise cellular and tissue responses t o infection, immune response and the 
presence of tumour markers are also considered. 
For physical agents that are forms of radiation, ot her data relevant to carcinogenicity 
may include descriptions of damaging effects at the  physiological, cellular and molecular 
level, as for chemical agents, and descriptions of how these effects occur. ‘Physical 
agents’ may also be considered to comprise foreign bodies, such as surgical implants of  PREAMBLE 29  
 
 various kinds, and poorly soluble fibres, dusts and  particles of various sizes, the patho-
genic effects of which are a result of their physic al presence in tissues or body cavities. 
Other relevant data for such materials may include characterization of cellular, tissue and 
physiological reactions to these materials and desc riptions of pathological conditions 
other than neoplasia with which they may be associa ted. 
(c) Other data relevant to mechanisms 
A description is provided of any structure–activity  relationships that may be relevant 
to an evaluation of the carcinogenicity of an agent , the toxicological implications of the 
physical and chemical properties, and any other dat a relevant to the evaluation that are not 
included elsewhere. 
High-output data, such as those derived from gene e xpression microarrays, and high-
throughput data, such as those that result from testing hund reds of agents for a single end-
point, pose a unique problem for the use of mechani stic data in the evaluation of a car-
cinogenic hazard. In the case of high-output data, there is the possibility to overinterpret 
changes in individual end-points (e.g. changes in e xpression in one gene) without con-
sidering the consistency of that finding in the broader cont ext of the other end-points (e.g. 
other genes with linked transcriptional control). High-ou tput data can be used in assessing 
mechanisms, but all end-points measured in a single  experiment need to be considered in 
the proper context. For high-throughput data, where  the number of observations far 
exceeds the number of end-points measured, their ut ility for identifying common mechan-
isms across multiple agents is enhanced. These data  can be used to identify mechanisms 
that not only seem plausible, but also have a consi stent pattern of carcinogenic response 
across entire classes of related compounds. 
(d) Susceptibility data 
Individuals, populations and life-stages may have g reater or lesser susceptibility to an 
agent, based on toxicokinetics, mechanisms of carci nogenesis and other factors. Examples 
of host and genetic factors that affect individual susceptibility include sex, genetic poly-
morphisms of genes involved in the metabolism of the  agent under evaluation, differences 
in metabolic capacity due to life-stage or the pres ence of disease, differences in DNA re-
pair capacity, competition for or alteration of met abolic capacity by medications or other 
chemical exposures, pre-existing hormonal imbalance  that is exacerbated by a chemical 
exposure, a suppressed immune system, periods of hi gher-than-usual tissue growth or 
regeneration and genetic polymorphisms that lead to  differences in behaviour (e.g. 
addiction). Such data can substantially increase th e strength of the evidence from 
epidemiological data and enhance the linkage of in- vivo and in-vitro laboratory studies to 
humans. 30 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 (e) Data on other adverse effects 
Data on acute, subchronic and chronic adverse effec ts relevant to the cancer eval-
uation are summarized. Adverse effects that confirm  distribution and biological effects at 
the sites of tumour development, or alterations in physiology that could lead to tumour 
development, are emphasized. Effects on reproductio n, embryonic and fetal survival and 
development are summarized briefly. The adequacy of  epidemiological studies of repro-
ductive outcome and genetic and related effects in humans is judged by the same criteria 
as those applied to epidemiological studies of canc er, but fewer details are given. 
5. Summary  
This section is a summary of data presented in the preceding  sections. Summaries can 
be found on the Monographs  programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr).  
(a) Exposure data  
Data are summarized, as appropriate, on the basis o f elements such as production, 
use, occurrence and exposure levels in the workplace and env ironment and measurements 
in human tissues and body fluids. Quantitative data  and time trends are given to compare 
exposures in different occupations and environmenta l settings. Exposure to biological 
agents is described in terms of transmission, preva lence and persistence of infection.  
(b) Cancer in humans 
Results of epidemiological studies pertinent to an assessment of human carcino-
genicity are summarized. When relevant, case report s and correlation studies are also 
summarized. The target organ(s) or tissue(s) in whi ch an increase in cancer was observed 
is identified. Dose–response and other quantitative  data may be summarized when 
available.  
(c) Cancer in experimental animals 
Data relevant to an evaluation of carcinogenicity i n animals are summarized. For each 
animal species, study design and route of administr ation, it is stated whether an increased 
incidence, reduced latency, or increased severity o r multiplicity of neoplasms or pre-
neoplastic lesions were observed, and the tumour si tes are indicated. If the agent produced 
tumours after prenatal exposure or in single-dose e xperiments, this is also mentioned. 
Negative findings, inverse relationships, dose–resp onse and other quantitative data are 
also summarized.  
(d) Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Data relevant to the toxicokinetics (absorption, di stribution, metabolism, elimination) 
and the possible mechanism(s) of carcinogenesis (e. g. genetic toxicity, epigenetic effects) 
are summarized. In addition, information on suscept ible individuals, populations and life- PREAMBLE 31  
 
 stages is summarized. This section also reports on other toxic effects, including repro-
ductive and developmental effects, as well as addit ional relevant data that are considered 
to be important. 
6. Evaluation and rationale  
Evaluations of the strength of the evidence for car cinogenicity arising from human 
and experimental animal data are made, using standa rd terms. The strength of the mech-
anistic evidence is also characterized.  
It is recognized that the criteria for these evalua tions, described below, cannot 
encompass all of the factors that may be relevant t o an evaluation of carcinogenicity. In 
considering all of the relevant scientific data, th e Working Group may assign the agent to 
a higher or lower category than a strict interpreta tion of these criteria would indicate.  
These categories refer only to the strength of the evidence that an exposure is 
carcinogenic and not to the extent of its carcinoge nic activity (potency). A classification 
may change as new information becomes available.  
An evaluation of the degree of evidence is limited to the materials tested, as defined 
physically, chemically or biologically. When the ag ents evaluated are considered by the 
Working Group to be sufficiently closely related, t hey may be grouped together for the 
purpose of a single evaluation of the degree of evi dence.  
(a) Carcinogenicity in humans 
The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity from studies in h umans is classified into one 
of the following categories:  
Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity : The Working Group considers that a causal 
relationship has been established between exposure to the agent and human cancer. 
That is, a positive relationship has been observed between the exposure and cancer in 
studies in which chance, bias and confounding could  be ruled out with reasonable 
confidence. A statement that there is sufficient evidence  is followed by a separate 
sentence that identifies the target organ(s) or tis sue(s) where an increased risk of 
cancer was observed in humans. Identification of a s pecific target organ or tissue does 
not preclude the possibility that the agent may cau se cancer at other sites.  
Limited evidence of carcinogenicity : A positive association has been observed between 
exposure to the agent and cancer for which a causal  interpretation is considered by the 
Working Group to be credible, but chance, bias or co nfounding could not be ruled out 
with reasonable confidence.  
Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity : The available studies are of insufficient quality,  
consistency or statistical power to permit a conclu sion regarding the presence or 
absence of a causal association between exposure an d cancer, or no data on cancer in 
humans are available.  32 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity : There are several adequate studies covering 
the full range of levels of exposure that humans ar e known to encounter, which are 
mutually consistent in not showing a positive assoc iation between exposure to the 
agent and any studied cancer at any observed level of exposure. The results from 
these studies alone or combined should have narrow confidence intervals with an 
upper limit close to the null value (e.g. a relativ e risk of 1.0). Bias and confounding 
should be ruled out with reasonable confidence, and  the studies should have an 
adequate length of follow-up. A conclusion of evidence suggesting lack of carcino-
genicity  is inevitably limited to the cancer sites, conditi ons and levels of exposure, 
and length of observation covered by the available studies. In addition, the possibility 
of a very small risk at the levels of exposure stud ied can never be excluded.  
In some instances, the above categories may be used  to classify the degree of evi-
dence related to carcinogenicity in specific organs  or tissues. 
When the available epidemiological studies pertain to a mixture, process, occupation 
or industry, the Working Group seeks to identify the  specific agent considered most likely 
to be responsible for any excess risk. The evaluati on is focused as narrowly as the avail-
able data on exposure and other aspects permit.  
(b) Carcinogenicity in experimental animals 
Carcinogenicity in experimental animals can be eval uated using conventional bio-
assays, bioassays that employ genetically modified animals, and other in-vivo bioassays 
that focus on one or more of the critical stages of  carcinogenesis. In the absence of data 
from conventional long-term bioassays or from assay s with neoplasia as the end-point, 
consistently positive results in several models that addr ess several stages in the multistage 
process of carcinogenesis should be considered in e valuating the degree of evidence of 
carcinogenicity in experimental animals. 
The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity in experim ental animals is classified into one 
of the following categories:  
Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity : The Working Group considers that a causal 
relationship has been established between the agent  and an increased incidence of 
malignant neoplasms or of an appropriate combinatio n of benign and malignant 
neoplasms in (a) two or more species of animals or (b) two or more independent 
studies in one species carried out at different tim es or in different laboratories or 
under different protocols. An increased incidence of tumo urs in both sexes of a single 
species in a well-conducted study, ideally conducte d under Good Laboratory 
Practices, can also provide sufficient evidence . 
A single study in one species and sex might be cons idered to provide sufficient 
evidence of carcinogenicity  when malignant neoplasms occur to an unusual degre e 
with regard to incidence, site, type of tumour or age at onset , or when there are strong 
findings of tumours at multiple sites.   PREAMBLE 33  
 
 Limited evidence of carcinogenicity : The data suggest a carcinogenic effect but are 
limited for making a definitive evaluation because,  e.g. (a) the evidence of carcino-
genicity is restricted to a single experiment; (b) there are  unresolved questions regard-
ing the adequacy of the design, conduct or interpre tation of the studies; (c) the agent 
increases the incidence only of benign neoplasms or  lesions of uncertain neoplastic 
potential; or (d) the evidence of carcinogenicity i s restricted to studies that demon-
strate only promoting activity in a narrow range of  tissues or organs.  
Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity : The studies cannot be interpreted as showing 
either the presence or absence of a carcinogenic effect beca use of major qualitative or 
quantitative limitations, or no data on cancer in e xperimental animals are available.  
Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity : Adequate studies involving at least two 
species are available which show that, within the l imits of the tests used, the agent is 
not carcinogenic. A conclusion of evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity  is 
inevitably limited to the species, tumour sites, ag e at exposure, and conditions and 
levels of exposure studied.  
(c) Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Mechanistic and other evidence judged to be relevan t to an evaluation of carcino-
genicity and of sufficient importance to affect the  overall evaluation is highlighted. This 
may include data on preneoplastic lesions, tumour p athology, genetic and related effects, 
structure–activity relationships, metabolism and to xicokinetics, physicochemical para-
meters and analogous biological agents.  
The strength of the evidence that any carcinogenic effect observed is due to a 
particular mechanism is evaluated, using terms such  as ‘weak’, ‘moderate’ or ‘strong’. 
The Working Group then assesses whether that partic ular mechanism is likely to be 
operative in humans. The strongest indications that  a particular mechanism operates in 
humans derive from data on humans or biological spe cimens obtained from exposed 
humans. The data may be considered to be especially  relevant if they show that the agent 
in question has caused changes in exposed humans th at are on the causal pathway to 
carcinogenesis. Such data may, however, never becom e available, because it is at least 
conceivable that certain compounds may be kept from  human use solely on the basis of 
evidence of their toxicity and/or carcinogenicity i n experimental systems.  
The conclusion that a mechanism operates in experime ntal animals is strengthened by 
findings of consistent results in different experim ental systems, by the demonstration of 
biological plausibility and by coherence of the ove rall database. Strong support can be 
obtained from studies that challenge the hypothesiz ed mechanism experimentally, by 
demonstrating that the suppression of key mechanist ic processes leads to the suppression 
of tumour development. The Working Group considers whether multiple mechanisms 
might contribute to tumour development, whether dif ferent mechanisms might operate in 
different dose ranges, whether separate mechanisms might operate in humans and experi-
mental animals and whether a unique mechanism might  operate in a susceptible group. 34 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 The possible contribution of alternative mechanisms  must be considered before con-
cluding that tumours observed in experimental anima ls are not relevant to humans. An 
uneven level of experimental support for different mechanisms may reflect that dis-
proportionate resources have been focused on invest igating a favoured mechanism.  
For complex exposures, including occupational and i ndustrial exposures, the chem-
ical composition and the potential contribution of carcinogens known to be present are 
considered by the Working Group in its overall evaluation  of human carcinogenicity. The 
Working Group also determines the extent to which t he materials tested in experimental 
systems are related to those to which humans are ex posed.  
(d) Overall evaluation 
Finally, the body of evidence is considered as a wh ole, in order to reach an overall 
evaluation of the carcinogenicity of the agent to h umans.  
An evaluation may be made for a group of agents tha t have been evaluated by the 
Working Group. In addition, when supporting data in dicate that other related agents, for 
which there is no direct evidence of their capacity  to induce cancer in humans or in 
animals, may also be carcinogenic, a statement descri bing the rationale for this conclusion 
is added to the evaluation narrative; an additional  evaluation may be made for this broader 
group of agents if the strength of the evidence war rants it.  
The agent is described according to the wording of one of the following categories, 
and the designated group is given. The categorizati on of an agent is a matter of scientific 
judgement that reflects the strength of the evidence  derived from studies in humans and in 
experimental animals and from mechanistic and other  relevant data.  
Group 1: The agent is carcinogenic to humans . 
This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in 
humans. Exceptionally, an agent may be placed in th is category when evidence of 
carcinogenicity in humans is less than sufficient  but there is sufficient evidence of 
carcinogenicity  in experimental animals and strong evidence in exp osed humans that 
the agent acts through a relevant mechanism of carc inogenicity.  
Group 2. 
This category includes agents for which, at one ext reme, the degree of evidence 
of carcinogenicity in humans is almost sufficient , as well as those for which, at the 
other extreme, there are no human data but for whic h there is evidence of carcino-
genicity in experimental animals. Agents are assign ed to either Group 2A ( probably 
carcinogenic to humans ) or Group 2B ( possibly carcinogenic to humans ) on the basis 
of epidemiological and experimental evidence of car cinogenicity and mechanistic and 
other relevant data. The terms probably carcinogenic  and possibly carcinogenic  have 
no quantitative significance and are used simply as  descriptors of different levels of 
evidence of human carcinogenicity, with probably carcinogenic  signifying a higher 
level of evidence than possibly carcinogenic .  PREAMBLE 35  
 
 Group 2A: The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans . 
This category is used when there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans 
and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental animals. In some cases, an 
agent may be classified in this category when there is  inadequate evidence of carcino-
genicity  in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental animals 
and strong evidence that the carcinogenesis is medi ated by a mechanism that also 
operates in humans. Exceptionally, an agent may be classified in this category solely 
on the basis of limited evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans. An agent may be 
assigned to this category if it clearly belongs, ba sed on mechanistic considerations, to 
a class of agents for which one or more members hav e been classified in Group 1 or 
Group 2A.  
Group 2B: The agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans . 
This category is used for agents for which there is  limited evidence of carcino-
genicity  in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experi-
mental animals. It may also be used when there is inadequate evidence of carcino-
genicity  in humans but there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental 
animals. In some instances, an agent for which ther e is inadequate evidence of 
carcinogenicity  in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in 
experimental animals together with supporting evide nce from mechanistic and other 
relevant data may be placed in this group. An agent may b e classified in this category 
solely on the basis of strong evidence from mechani stic and other relevant data.  
Group 3: The agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans . 
This category is used most commonly for agents for which the evidence of 
carcinogenicity is inadequate  in humans and inadequate  or limited  in experimental 
animals.  
Exceptionally, agents for which the evidence of car cinogenicity is inadequate  in 
humans but sufficient  in experimental animals may be placed in this cate gory when 
there is strong evidence that the mechanism of carc inogenicity in experimental 
animals does not operate in humans.  
Agents that do not fall into any other group are al so placed in this category.  
An evaluation in Group 3 is not a determination of non-carcinogenicity or overall 
safety. It often means that further research is nee ded, especially when exposures are 
widespread or the cancer data are consistent with d iffering interpretations.  
Group 4: The agent is probably not carcinogenic to humans . 
This category is used for agents for which there is  evidence suggesting lack of 
carcinogenicity  in humans and in experimental animals. In some ins tances, agents for 
which there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans but evidence 
suggesting lack of carcinogenicity  in experimental animals, consistently and strongly  36 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 supported by a broad range of mechanistic and other  relevant data, may be classified 
in this group.  
(e) Rationale 
The reasoning that the Working Group used to reach its evaluation is presented and 
discussed. This section integrates the major findin gs from studies of cancer in humans, 
studies of cancer in experimental animals, and mech anistic and other relevant data. It in-
cludes concise statements of the principal line(s) of argument that emerged, the con-
clusions of the Working Group on the strength of th e evidence for each group of studies, 
citations to indicate which studies were pivotal to  these conclusions, and an explanation 
of the reasoning of the Working Group in weighing d ata and making evaluations. When 
there are significant differences of scientific int erpretation among Working Group Mem-
bers, a brief summary of the alternative interpreta tions is provided, together with their 
scientific rationale and an indication of the relat ive degree of support for each alternative.

–39– GENERAL REMARKS 
This ninety-seventh volume of IARC Monographs contains evaluations of the 
carcinogenic hazard to humans of 1,3-butadiene, eth ylene oxide and some vinyl halides 
(vinyl fluoride, vinyl chloride and vinyl bromide).  The most recent previous evaluations 
of these industrial gases were published in Supplem ent 7 (IARC, 1987) for vinyl chloride, 
Volume 60 (IARC, 1994) for ethylene oxide, Volume 6 3 (IARC, 1995) for vinyl fluoride 
and Volume 71 (IARC, 1999) for 1,3-butadiene and vi nyl bromide. Newer 
epidemiological and mechanistic studies have since been published and are evaluated in 
this volume. 
Numbers of exposed workers 
No estimates of numbers of exposed workers worldwid e are available. National 
estimates have been reported for the USA (National Occupational Exposure Survey, 
NOES) and for the member states of the European Uni on (CAREX information system 
on occupational exposure to carcinogens). 
NOES was a nationwide observational survey that was  conducted in a sample of 4490 
establishments from 1981 to 1983. The target popula tion was defined as employees 
working in establishments or job sites in the USA t hat employed eight or more workers in 
a category defined in the list of Standard Industri al Classifications. Generally, these 
classifications mainly covered construction, manufa cturing, transportation, private and 
business services and hospital industries. The NOES  sampled little or no activity in 
agriculture, mining, wholesale/retail trade, financ e/real estate or government operations. 
NOES addressed recordable potential exposure that h ad to meet two criteria: (1) a 
chemical, physical or biological agent or trade-nam e product had to be observed in 
sufficient proximity to an employee such that one o r two physical phases of that agent or 
product probably came into contact or entered the b ody of the employee; and (2) the 
duration of the potential exposure had to meet the minimal duration guidelines, i.e., it 
must have presented a potential exposure for at lea st 30 min per week (on an annual 
average) or be used at least once per week for 90% of the weeks or the work year (NOES, 
1997).  
The CAREX information system was designed to provid e selected exposure data and 
documented estimates of the number of workers expos ed to carcinogens by country, 
carcinogen and industry for 15 Member States of the  European Union. CAREX includes 40 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 data on agents that have been evaluated by the IARC (all agen ts in Groups 1 and 2A as of 
February 1995, and selected agents in Group 2B) and  on ionizing radiation that were 
displayed across 55 industrial classes. The minimal  criterion for exposure was defined 
agent by agent. In general, workers were considerer d to have been exposed if a specified 
background level was exceeded. Occupational exposur es for 1990–93 were estimated in 
two phases. Firstly, estimates were generated by th e CAREX system on the basis of data 
from national labour forces and estimates of exposu re prevalence from two reference 
countries (Finland and the USA) that had the most c omprehensive data available on 
exposures to these agents. Thereafter, these estima tes were refined for selected countries 
(Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom) 
by national experts with regard to the perceived ex posure patterns in their own countries 
compared with those of the reference countries (Kau ppinen et al. , 2000).  
The figures of NOES and CAREX are not comparable be cause definitions of 
exposure, data collection and estimation methods we re different. The inclusion or 
exclusion of workers exposed only occasionally, or to very low levels that were close to 
the background levels, may strongly influence the e stimates. The NOES estimates (from 
1981 to 1983) and CAREX estimates (from 1990 to 199 3) are also fairly old and the 
extent of exposure may have changed considerably si nce then.  
Classification of lymphomas 
The diagnosis and classification of haematopoietic and lymphopoietic malignancies 
are extremely complex and have undergone successive  changes over the course of time. 
The original classification was based largely on mo rphology of the tumour cells and this 
was reflected in the 9th International Classificati on of Diseases (ICD-9) categories 200–
208 (WHO, 1975). The more recent WHO classification  (Jaffe et al., 2001) considers 
more recent developments in cytogenetics and molecu lar biology and has little overlap 
with the ICD-9 classification (WHO, 1975). Also a d istinction between ICD-9 200 and 
202 is probably not meaningful in the light of the WHO re-classification. It has to be 
noted that this WHO classification was superseded i n 2008 (Swerdlow et al ., 2008). 
The major change in the WHO classification is that lymphocytic leukaemias and 
lymphomas are no longer considered to be different diseases. Rather, the essential feature 
of the definition is the tumour cells, and a neopla sm of a particular lymphoid cell type 
may present as either leukaemia or a solid tumour m ass (lymphoma) in a given patient. 
This has a bearing on the assessment of association s with exposures in epidemiological 
studies, which previously considered leukaemias (al l types combined, or specific

1.1.4  Technical products and impurities 
In the production of polymers such as styrene–butad iene copolymer resins, the 
polymerization catalysts used are sensitive to some  impurities such as oxygen and 
moisture. Butadiene that is used for polymerization  is 99.9% pure. Up to 22 different 
volatile components of light molecular mass were de tected as impurities with the ASTM 
method D2593-93 (reapproved in 2004; ASTM, 2004). 
1.1.5  Analysis 
Selected methods for the analysis of butadiene in v arious matrices are listed in 
Table 1. Those for the analysis of butadiene in air  have been evaluated; there appears to 
be no single preferred method, but more recent ones  give a higher performance. Thermal 
desorption provides high levels of accuracy and pre cision (Bianchi et al ., 1997). 48 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 Several gas detector tubes are used in conjunction with common colorimetric 
reactions to detect butadiene. The reactions includ e the reduction of chromate or di-
chromate to chromous ion and the reduction of ammon ium molybdate and palladium 
sulfate to molybdenum blue (Saltzman & Harman, 1989 ). 
Passive dosimeters that use different techniques (t hermal desorption and gas 
chromatography, colorimetric reactions) are also av ailable for the detection of butadiene.

 1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
Butadiene was first produced in the late nineteenth  century by pyrolysis of various 
organic materials. Commercial production began in t he 1930s (Sun & Wristers, 2002). 
 (a) Manufacturing processes  
(i) Ethylene co-production  
Butadiene is manufactured primarily as a co-product  of the steam cracking of hydro-
carbon streams to produce ethylene. This process ac counts for over 95% of global buta-
diene production (White, 2007). 
Steam cracking is a complex, highly endothermic pyr olysis reaction, during which a 
hydrocarbon feedstock is heated to approximately 80 0 °C and 34 kPa for less than 1 sec 
and the carbon–carbon and carbon–hydrogen bonds are  broken. As a result, a mixture of 
olefins, aromatic compounds, tar and gases is forme d. These products are cooled and 
separated into specific boiling-range cuts of C 1, C 2, C 3 and C 4 compounds. The C 4 fraction 
contains butadiene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 2-butene  and some other minor hydrocarbons. 
The overall yields of butadiene during the process depend on both the parameters of the 
process and the composition of feedstocks. Generall y, heavier steam-cracking feedstocks 
produce greater amounts of butadiene. Separation an d purification of butadiene from 
other components is carried out mainly by an extrac tive distillation process. The most 
commonly used solvents are acetonitrile and dimethy lformamide; dimethylacetamide, 
furfural and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone have also been used to this  end (Sun & Wristers, 
2002; Walther, 2003). 
(ii) Dehydrogenation  
The intentional dehydrogenation of n-butane or n-butenes also yields butadiene. This 
is achieved by the Houdry process for dehydrogenati on of n-butane or by oxidative 
dehydrogenation of n-butenes (Walther, 2003). 
(iii) Ethanol-based production  
A plant in India produces butadiene in a two-step p rocess from ethanol. Initial de-
hydrogenation is achieved through a copper catalyst , and the resulting mixture is then 
dehydrated at atmospheric pressure in the presence of a zirconium oxide or tantalum 
oxide–silica gel catalyst at 300–350 °C. Overall yields of butadiene in the second reaction 
are about 70%. This process is very similar to the adol condensation of acetaldehyde 
(Walther, 2003). 
(b) Butadiene extraction processes 
Regardless of the production process, final purific ation of butadiene requires removal 
of any butane, butene or acetylene impurities. Curr ently, seven different commercial 50 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 processes exist for the extraction of butadiene tha t employ different extraction solvents. 
The processes, identified by the licencer and type of solven t, are: BASF Aktiengesellshaft 
— N-methylpyrrolidone; Lyondell Petrochemical Company — acetonitrile; Zeon Corp-
oration — dimethylformamide; ConocoPhillips — furfu ral; Shell Chemical Company — 
acetonitrile; Solutia — β-methoxyproprionitrile with 15% furfural; Dow (form erly Union 
Carbide Corporation) — dimethylacetamide; and (no l icencer) — cuprous ammonium 
acetate solution (Walther, 2003).  
(c) Production volume 
An estimated 9.3 million tonnes of butadiene were p roduced worldwide in 2005 
(CMAI, 2006). Production volumes for different regi ons for the years 2004 and 2006 are 
given in Table 2. 
World capacity grew by 3.5% per year between 1997 a nd 2002. During that period, 
most of the increase in capacity occurred in Asia, South America and the Middle East. 
Asia is now the largest producer of butadiene, and accounts for one-third of the world 
capacity (Walther, 2003). 
Diepoxybutane is not believed to be produced commer cially except in small quan-
tities for research purposes (National Library of M edicine, 2008).

1.2.2  Use 
Butadiene is used primarily in the production of sy nthetic rubbers and polymers. 
These polymers are used in a wide variety of indust rial and consumer products, to im-
prove their functionality, performance and safety a nd lower their costs. Butadiene-based 
products are important components of automobiles, c onstruction materials, appliance  1,3-BUTADIENE 51  
 
 parts, computers and telecommunications equipment, clothing, protective clothing, pack-
aging and household articles (White, 2007). 
The synthetic rubbers that are produced from butadi ene include styrene–butadiene 
rubber, polybutadiene rubber, styrene–butadiene lat ex, chloroprene rubber and nitrile 
rubber. Important plastics that contain butadiene a s a monomeric component are shock-
resistant polystyrene, a two-phase system that cons ists of polystyrene and polybutadiene; 
polymers that consist of acrylonitrile, butadiene a nd styrene; and a copolymer of methyl 
methacrylate, butadiene and styrene, which is used as a modifier for poly(vinyl)chloride. 
Butadiene is also used as an intermediate in the pr oduction of chloroprene, adiponitrile 
and other basic petrochemicals (White, 2007).  
Diepoxybutane has been proposed for use in curing p olymers and cross-linking textile 
fibres (National Library of Medicine, 2008). 
1.3 Occurrence 
1.3.1 Natural occurrence 
Butadiene is not known to occur as a natural produc t. 
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
According to the 1990–93 CAREX database (see Genera l Remarks) for 15 countries 
of the European Union (Kauppinen et al. , 2000) and the 1981–83 US National 
Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES, 1997), approxim ately 31 500 workers in Europe 
and 50 000 workers in the USA were potentially expo sed to butadiene. 
Based on data from CAREX, the major categories of i ndustrial exposure to butadiene 
in 15 European countries are the manufacture of ind ustrial chemicals (8000 persons), 
rubber products (7000 persons), plastic products (7 000 persons), petroleum refining (2200 
persons) and building construction (1600 persons) ( Kauppinen et al. , 2000). 
In the studies presented below, the accuracy of the  levels of exposure to butadiene 
measured with the methods used until the mid-1980s may have been affected by the 
inability to distinguish between butadiene and othe r C 4 compounds, low desorption 
efficiency at low concentrations, possible sample b reakthrough in charcoal tubes and 
possible loss during storage (Lunsford et al. , 1990; Bianchi et al. , 1997). 
(a) Petroleum refining and butadiene monomer production 
Detailed industrial hygiene surveys were conducted in the USA by the National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in 198 5 in four of 10 facilities where 
butadiene was produced by solvent extraction of C 4 fractions that originated from 
ethylene co-product streams (Krishnan et al. , 1987). Levels of butadiene to which 
workers in various job categories were exposed are summarized in Table 3. Jobs that 
required workers to handle or transport containers,  such as emptying sample cylinders or 52 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 loading and unloading tank trucks or rail cars, pre sented the greatest potential exposure. 
Geometric means of full-shift exposure levels for o ther job categories were below 1 ppm 
[2.2 mg/m 3]. Short-term samples showed that activities such a s open-loop sampling and 
emptying cylinders were associated with peak exposu res of 100 ppm [220 mg/m 3]. Full-
shift area samples indicated that ambient concentra tions of butadiene were greatest in the 
rail car terminals (geometric mean, 1.8 ppm [3.9 mg /m 3]) and in the tank storage farm 
(2.1 ppm [4.7 mg/m 3]).

From Krishnan et al.  (1987) 
Monitoring in a plant in Finland generally indicated  ambient air levels of butadiene of 
less than 10 ppm [22 mg/m 3] at different sites (33 samples; mean sampling tim e, 5.3 h). In 
personal samples for 16 process workers, the concen trations ranged from < 0.1 to 
477 ppm [< 0.22–1050 mg/m 3] (mean, 11.5 ppm [25 mg/m 3]; median, < 0.1 ppm 
[< 0.22 mg/m 3]; 46 samples; mean sampling time, 2.5 h). The high est concentrations were 
measured during the collection of samples, for whic h protective clothing and respirators 
were used (Work Environment Fund, 1991). 
A study of biological monitoring for the mutagenic effects of exposure to butadiene 
reported estimated average exposures of 1 ppm [2.2 mg/m 3] for workers in a butadiene 
monomer plant. Ambient air concentrations in produc tion areas averaged 3.5 ppm 
[7.7 mg/m 3], while average concentrations of 0.03 ppm [0.07 m g/m 3] were reported for 
the control area (Ward, J.B. et al ., 1996).  
Levels of exposure to butadiene of workers in vario us job groups in the production 
and distribution of gasoline (see IARC, 1989) are s hown in Table 4. Table 5 shows 
exposures in 1984–87 of workers in different areas of petroleum refineries and  1,3-BUTADIENE 53

 petrochemical facilities where crude butadiene was produced (usually a C 4 stream 
obtained as a by-product of ethylene production). T able 6 shows more recent data on 
crackers at butadiene production plants for the yea rs 1986–93 (ECETOC, 1997). 
Exposure data from 15 monomer extraction sites for the years 1984–93 showed that 
less than 10% of the measured concentrations exceed ed 5 ppm [11 mg/m 3] (Table 7); in 
1995 (Table 8), personal exposure levels in general  were below 5 ppm [11 mg/m 3] 
(ECETOC, 1997). 
In 1998, personal exposure to butadiene was measure d for 24 workers in a monomer 
production facility in the Czech Republic. The mean  ( ± standard deviation [SD]) 
concentration of butadiene, calculated from 217 ind ividual time-weighted average (TWA) 
measurements, was 0.6 ± 2.1 mg/m 3 [0.27 ± 0.95 ppm]. The personal TWA measure-
ments from all monomer production workers ranged fr om undetectable to 19.9 mg/m 3. 
The mean concentration for the control group was 0. 03 ± 0.03 mg/m 3 [0.01 ± 0.01 ppm], 
calculated from 28 personal TWA exposure measuremen ts (Albertini et al ., 2003a). 
Personal exposure to butadiene of 10 workers who he ld different jobs in a 
petrochemical plant in Finland was assessed using p assive monitors shortly after the 
threshold limit value (TLV) of 1 ppm had come into force. A total of 119 personal 
breathing zone samples were taken and 117 were anal ysed. Of these, 32 (27%) samples 
were under the limit of quantification (0.029 mg/m 3 [0.013 ppm] in a 20.5-L sample), 81 
samples (69%) were between the limit of quantificat ion and 1 ppm [2.2 mg/m 3] and four 
samples (3%) were over the Finnish occupational exp osure limit of 1 ppm. The mean 
value of all samples was 0.17 ppm [0.38 mg/m 3] and the mean value of the samples that 
exceeded the Finnish occupational exposure limit wa s 1.75 ppm [3.87 mg/m 3]. The mean

significantly affect the values, but the seasonal e ffect was significant ( p = 0.02) (Anttinen-
Klemetti et al ., 2004). 
The occupational exposure of 42 workers in a petroc hemical plant in Italy where 
butadiene was produced and used to prepare polymers  was assessed by biomonitoring. 
The control group originated from the same industri al complex and included 43 workers 
who had no significant occupational exposure to but adiene. Active sampling from the 
breathing zone of the workers was performed during a full shift. Each exposed worker 
was assessed three to four times over a period of 6  weeks during different shifts. The 
mean exposure level of the control group was 0.9 µg/m 3 [0.4 ppb] (SD, 1.0) and the 
lowest and highest values were < 0.1 and 3.8 µg/m 3 [< 0.05 and 1.7 ppb], respectively. 
The mean exposure level of the exposed group was 11 .5 µg/m 3 [5.2 ppb] (SD, 35.8) and 
the lowest and highest values were < 0.1 and 220.6 µg/m 3 [ < 0.04 and 99.8 ppb], 
respectively (Fustinoni et al ., 2004). 
An exposure assessment was carried out in southern Taiwan, China, on a 120-acre 
[486 000 m 2] petrochemical complex that comprised 11 different  manufacturing plants. 
Butadiene was produced in two of the plants, which had an annual production of about 
156 000 tonnes per year. Using the Fourier transfor m infrared spectroscopy technique, data 
were collected on 77 days during the period 1997–99 . The relative number of samples that  1,3-BUTADIENE 55

were above the detection limit was 15.2% and the me an value of the measurements was 
10.5 ± 36.7 ppb [23.2 ± 81.1 µg/m 3]. The maximum concentration measured was 3.1 ppm 
[6.8 mg/m 3] (Chan et al ., 2006). [Measurements were area samples and may u nder-
estimate exposure of the workers.] 
In the monomer industry, potential exposure to comp ounds other than butadiene 
includes exposure to extraction solvents and compon ents of the C 4 feedstock. Extraction 
solvents differ between facilities: common solvents  include dimethylformamide, di-
methylacetamide, acetonitrile, β-methoxypropionitrile (Fajen, 1985a), furfural and 
aqueous cuprous ammonium acetate (Occupational Safe ty and Health Administration, 
1990b). Stabilizers are commonly used to prevent th e formation of peroxides in air and 
during polymerization. No information was available  on these exposures or on exposure 
to chemicals other than butadiene that are produced  in some facilities such as butylenes, 
ethylene, propylene, polyethylene and polypropylene  resins, methyl- tert -butyl ether and 
aromatic hydrocarbons (Fajen, 1985b,c). 
(b) Production of polymers and derivatives 
In samples taken at a styrene–butadiene rubber plan t in the USA in 1976 (Table 9), 
levels of butadiene above 100 ppm [220 mg/m 3] were encountered by technical services 
personnel (115 ppm [253 mg/m 3]) and an instrument man (174 ppm [385 mg/m 3]; 
Meinhardt et al. , 1978). At another styrene–butadiene rubber manufa cturing plant in the 
USA in 1979, the only two departments in which leve ls were greater than 10 ppm 
[22 mg/m 3] were the tank farm (53.4 ppm [118 mg/m 3]) and maintenance (20.7 ppm [46 
mg/m 3]; Checkoway & Williams, 1982). Overall mean 8-h TW A exposure levels differed  58 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

respectively (Meinhardt et al ., 1982). 
Detailed industrial hygiene surveys were conducted in 1986 in five of 17 facilities in 
the USA where butadiene was used to produce styrene –butadiene rubber, nitrile–
butadiene rubber, polybutadiene rubber, neoprene an d adiponitrile (Fajen, 1988). Levels 
of butadiene to which workers in various job catego ries were exposed are summarized in 
Table 10. Process technicians in unloading, in the tank farm and in the purification, 
polymerization and reaction areas, laboratory techn icians and maintenance technicians 
were exposed to the highest levels. Short-term samp ling showed that activities such as 
sampling a barge and laboratory work were associate d with peak exposures of more than 
100 ppm [220 mg/m 3]. Full-shift area sampling indicated that geometri c mean ambient 
concentrations of butadiene were less than 0.5 ppm [1.1 mg/m 3] and usually less than 0.1 
ppm [0.22 mg/m 3] in all locations measured at the five plants. 
A biological monitoring study that used personal sa mpling reported average levels of 
butadiene of 0.30, 0.21 and 0.12 ppm [0.66, 0.46 an d 0.27 mg/m 3] for the high-, inter-
mediate- and low-exposure groups, respectively, in a styrene–butadiene rubber plant in

From Fajen (1988) 
In 13 of 27 European sites where styrene–butadiene rubber and styrene–butadiene 
latex were produced, less than 10% of the concentra tions measured exceeded 5 ppm 
(Table 11; ECETOC, 1997). 
Data from the Netherlands are available from 1976 o nwards, but the measurement 
methods used in the early surveys are unknown (Kwek keboom, 1996; Dubbeld, 1998). 
No clear trend can be seen for the years 1990–97, b ut average exposures were relatively 
low (arithmetic mean < 3 ppm [6.6 mg/m 3]) (Table 12). 
Exposure of 38 workers was measured in a butadiene polymer production facility in 
China. Personal full-shift measurements established  that workers in butadiene operations 
were exposed to a median level of 2.0 ppm [4.4 mg/m3]. Short-term breathing zone 
measurements of butadiene showed great extremes in exposure; DMF [dimethyl-
formamide] analysts had a median exposure of 54 ppm [119 mg/m 3] (range, below detec-
tion to 3090 ppm [6829 mg/m 3]; 50 samples), polymer analysts had a median exposure of 
6.5 ppm [14.4 mg/m 3] (range, below detection to 1078 ppm [2382 mg/m 3]; 41 samples) 
and maintenance-recovery workers had a median expos ure of 7.0 ppm [15.5 mg/m 3] 
(range, below detection to > 12 000 ppm [> 26 520 m g/m 3]; 24 samples) (Hayes et al ., 
2001). 
A biomonitoring study carried out in a styrene–buta diene rubber plant in Southeast 
Texas, in which 37 workers were monitored during th eir entire work shift using passive 
samplers, demonstrated that levels in the tank area  exceeded the current Occupational 60 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

workers wore protective equipment on this particula r job. TWA values in various work 
areas are summarized in Table 13 (Ward et al ., 2001). 
In 1998, 319 personal workshift TWA measurements of  exposure to butadiene were 
obtained for 34 workers in a polymer production pla nt in the Czech Republic. The mean 
(± SD) concentration of butadiene was 1.8 ± 4.7 mg/m 3 [0.8 ± 2.1 ppm]. The individual 
TWA measurements from all polymer production worker s ranged from 0.002 to 39.0 
mg/m 3 [0.001–17.6 ppm]. The level of exposure of the con trol group was 0.03 ± 0.03 
mg/m 3 [0.01 ± 0.01 ppm], calculated from 28 personal TWA measure ments (Albertini et 
al ., 2003a). 
A Finnish study assessed personal exposure to butad iene in three plants that manu-
factured styrene–butadiene latex. Full-shift air sa mples were collected from the breathing 
zone of 28 workers using passive samplers over 4 mo nths. A total of 885 samples were 
collected and the number of samples per participant  ranged from 19 to 39. Samples were 
collected at the same time in all three plants. The  data showed that 624 (70.5%) of the 
samples were below the limit of quantification; 240  (27.1%) samples were between the 
limit of quantification and 1 ppm [2.2 mg/m 3] and 21 (2.4%) were over the Finnish 
occupational exposure limit of 1 ppm [2.2 mg/m 3]. Mean butadiene concentrations in the 
three plants were 0.068, 0.125 and 0.302 ppm [0.15,  0.28 and 0.67 mg/m 3], respectively. 62 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

In a Czech study that included 26 female control wo rkers, 23 female butadiene-
exposed workers, 25 male control workers and 30 mal e butadiene-exposed workers, 10 
personal full-shift (8-h) measurements per worker o ver a 4-month period showed mean 
8-h TWA exposure levels of 0.008 mg/m 3 and 0.4 mg/m 3 [0.004 and 0.18 ppm] for 
control and exposed women, respectively. The highes t single 8-h TWA value among 
exposed women was 9.8 mg/m 3 [4.5 ppm]. Mean 8-h TWA exposure levels were 0.007  
mg/m 3 and 0.8 mg/m 3 [0.003 and 0.36 ppm] for control and exposed men, respectively; 
personal single 8-h TWA values of up to 12.6 mg/m 3 [5.7 ppm] were measured in the 
exposed group. The concentrations for butadiene-exp osed workers were significantly 
higher than those for the controls for both men and  women; the concentrations for 
butadiene-exposed workers were significantly higher  for men than for women (Albertini 
et al ., 2007). [The difference in exposure levels may be  due to differences in tasks 
performed by men and women.] 
Data from a Canadian styrene–butadiene rubber plant  indicate a clear decrease in 
exposure from 1977 to 1991 (Sathiakumar & Delzell, 2007; Table 14). The data were 
used to validate the estimates of historical exposu re to butadiene (Macaluso et al. , 1996, 
2004; Sathiakumar et al ., 2007). 
The manufacture of butadiene-based polymers and but adiene derivatives implies 
potential exposure to a number of other chemical ag ents that vary according to product 
and process and include other monomers (styrene, ac rylonitrile, chloroprene), solvents, 
additives (e.g. activators, antioxidants, modifiers ), catalysts, mineral oils, carbon black, 
chlorine, inorganic acids and caustic solutions (Fa jen, 1986a,b; Roberts, 1986). Styrene, 
benzene and toluene levels were measured in 1979 in  various departments of a plant that  1,3-BUTADIENE 63  
 
 manufactured styrene–butadiene rubber in the USA: m ean 8-h TWA levels of styrene 
were below 2 ppm [8.4 mg/m 3], except for tank-farm workers (13.7 ppm [57.5 mg/ m 3], 
eight samples); mean benzene levels did not exceed 0.1 ppm [0.3 mg/m 3], and those of 
toluene did not exceed 0.9 ppm [3.4 mg/m 3] (Checkoway & Williams, 1982). Meinhardt 
et al . (1982) reported that the mean 8-h TWA levels of s tyrene in two styrene–butadiene 
rubber manufacturing plants were 0.94 ppm [3.9 mg/m3] (55 samples) and 1.99 ppm [8.4 
mg/m 3] (35 samples) in 1977; the average level of benzen e measured in one of the plants 
was 0.1 ppm [0.3 mg/m 3] (three samples). Average levels of styrene, tolue ne, benzene, 
vinyl cyclohexene and cyclooctadiene were reported to be below 1 ppm in another 
styrene–butadiene rubber plant in 1977 (Burroughs, 1977). Dimethyldithiocarbamate has 
been used in some plants and dermal exposure to thi s compound potentially exists 
(Delzell et al. , 2001).

In a polybutadiene rubber warehouse, levels of 0.00 3 ppm [0.007 mg/m 3] butadiene 
were found in area samples; area and personal sample s taken in tyre plants revealed levels 
of 0.007–0.05 ppm [0.016–0.11 mg/m 3] butadiene (Rubber Manufacturers’ Association, 
1984). 
Unreacted butadiene was detected as a trace (0.04–0 .2 mg/kg) in 15 of 37 bulk 
samples of polymers and other chemicals synthesized  from butadiene and analysed in 
1985–86. Only two samples contained measurable amou nts of butadiene: tetrahydro-
phthalic anhydride (53 mg/kg) and vinylpyridine lat ex (16.5 mg/kg) (JACA Corp., 1987).  
Detailed industrial hygiene surveys were conducted in 1984–87 in the USA at a 
rubber tyre plant and an industrial hose plant wher e styrene–butadiene rubber, poly-
butadiene and acrylonitrile–butadiene rubber were p rocessed. No butadiene was detected 
in any of 124 personal full-shift samples from worke rs in the following job categories that 
were identified as involving potential exposure to butadiene: Banbury operators, mill 
operators, extruder operators, curing operators, conveye r operators, calendering operators, 
wire winders, tube machine operators, tyre builders  and tyre repair and buffer workers 
(Fajen et al ., 1990). 
Occupational exposures to many other agents in the rubber goods manufacturing 
industry have been reviewed previously (IARC, 1982) . 
(d) Comparison of exposure levels in monomer and styrene–butadiene 
rubber production facilities 
Exposures measured in monomer production facilities  in the USA demonstrated 
overall mean levels of 3.5 ppm [7.7 mg/m 3] (measured in 1979–92; number not reported; 
stationary sampling; Cowles et al ., 1994) and 7.1 ppm [15.7 mg/m 3] (measured in 1985; 
87 samples; personal sampling; Krishnan et al ., 1987). Recently reported values from the 
Czech Republic and Finland were 0.64 ppm [1.41 mg/m3] (measured in 1998; 217 
samples; personal sampling) and 0.17 ppm [0.38 mg/m3] (measured in 2002; 117 
samples; personal sampling) (Albertini et al. , 2003a; Anttinen-Klemetti et al. , 2004). 
Measurement of butadiene concentrations in a styren e–butadiene rubber plant in 
Canada demonstrated a decrease in exposure during t he 14 years of monitoring. The 
levels dropped from 24.8 ppm in 1977 [54.8 mg/m 3] to 0.34 ppm [0.75 mg/m 3] in 1991 
(Table 14) (Sathiakumar et al ., 2007).  
The decreasing trend of exposure was apparent in bo th monomer and styrene–
butadiene rubber production; however, the lack of d ata from the 1940s to the 1970s does 
not allow comparison between the two processes. 
1.3.3  Environmental occurrence 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency To xic Chemical Release 
Inventory in the USA, industrial releases of butadi ene to the atmosphere from industrial  1,3-BUTADIENE 65  
 
 facilities in the USA were 4425 tonnes in 1987, 236 0 tonnes in 1990 and 1385 tonnes in 
1995. According to the same database, fugitive air emissions were 157 973 kg and point 
source air emissions were 450 926 kg in 2005 (Envir onmental Protection Agency Toxic 
Release Inventory, 2005; National Library of Medici ne, 2008). 
Under laboratory conditions, non-catalyst vehicles emitted butadiene at a rate of 20.7 
± 9.2 mg/kg. Vehicles that had a functioning catalys t–emission control device had an 
average emission rate of 2.1 ± 1.5 mg/km. Based on these numbers, the authors con cluded 
that vehicle emissions of butadiene have been subst antially underestimated (Ye et al. , 
1997). Based on an average of 20 000 km per year per car and a pproximately 243 million 
registered cars in the USA in 2004, and considering  the average emission rates estimated 
by Ye et al . (1997), emissions of butadiene from automobile exhausts c an be estimated to 
amount to approximately 106 770 tonnes per year. 
Butadiene is also released to the atmosphere from t he smoke of bush fires, the thermal 
breakdown or burning of plastics and by volatizatio n from gasoline (Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Registry, 1992; see IARC, 19 92).  
Kim et al . (2001, 2002) measured the concentrations of 15 vo latile organic com-
pounds, including butadiene, in a wide range of urb an micro-environments in the United 
Kingdom (Table 15) and estimated the personal expos ure of 12 urban dwellers directly 
and indirectly via static monitoring combined with a personal activities diary (Table 16).

Environmental exposure to emissions, including buta diene, was compared between 
bus and cycling commuters on a route in Dublin. Sam ples were collected during both 
morning and afternoon rush-hour periods using conti nuous sampling. The average 
concentrations experienced by the cyclist and the b us passenger for all journeys were 
0.47 ppb [103 µg/m 3] (SD, 0.19; min., 0.24; max., 0.81) and 0.78 ppb [ 1.7 µg/m 3] (SD, 
0.34; min., 0.34; max., 1.49), respectively (O’Dono ghue et al. , 2007). 
In the United Kingdom, the estimated emission of bu tadiene in 1996 was 10.6 
thousand tonnes. Road vehicle exhaust emissions dom inated and comprised 68% of the 
total emissions, while emissions from off-road vehi cles and machinery accounted for 
14%. The remaining emissions arose from the chemica l industry, during the manufacture 
of butadiene and its use in the production of vario us rubber compounds. These two 
processes accounted for 8 and 10%, respectively, of  total emissions in the United King-
dom in 1996 (Dollard et al. , 2001). 
Municipal structural fires are a source of butadien e, and the mean level of butadiene 
from nine fires ranged from 0.03 to 4.84 ppm [0.07– 9.9 mg/m 3] (Austin et al. , 2001). 
Domestic wood burning also has an impact on levels of butadiene in homes. Wood 
burners had a significantly higher personal exposur e to butadiene (median, 0.18 µg/m 3) 
than the reference group. Similarly, significantly higher indoor levels were reported 
(median, 0.23 µg/m 3) in homes of wood burners than in the homes of the  reference group 
(Gustafson et al ., 2007). 
The intake of butadiene that results from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 
for a person who lives with one or more smokers in homes where smoking is permitted 
was estimated to be in the range of 16–37 µg per day (Nazaroff & Singer, 2004). The 
levels of butadiene in public houses in Dublin were assessed  before and after the smoking 
ban in 2004. The average level before the ban was 4 .15 µg/m 3 [1.87 ppb]. The levels of 
butadiene recorded in the same establishments when cigarettes were no longer being 
smoked dropped significantly to 0.22 µg/m 3 [0.1 ppb], which is still higher than the 
average ambient level (0.12 µg/m 3 [0.05 ppb]) (McNabola et al ., 2006). 
In the metropolitan area of Mexico City, three pers ons who were simultaneously 
monitored for butadiene inside the home and outdoor s had median levels of 2.1 µg/m 3 
[1 ppb] (max., 11.5 µg/m 3 [5.2 ppb]), 2.0 µg/m 3 [0.9 ppb] (max., 8.3 µg/m 3 [3.7 ppb]) and  1,3-BUTADIENE 67  
 
 0.8 µg/m 3 [0.4 ppb] (max., 4.6 µg/m 3 [2.1 ppb]) for personal, indoor and outdoor ex-
posure, respectively (Serrano-Trespalacios et al ., 2004). 
Ambient concentrations of butadiene were measured i n Japan during the years 1997–
2003 at general environmental stations, roadside st ations and industrial vicinity stations. 
The mean levels in 1998 were 0.28, 0.56 and 0.37 µg/m 3 [0.13, 0.25 and 0.17 ppb] for the 
general environment, roadside and industrial vicini ty, respectively. The overall level was 
0.36 µg/m 3 [0.16 ppb]. In 2003, corresponding levels were 0.2 2, 0.42 and 0.31 µg/m 3 
[0.10, 0.19 and 0.14 ppb], with an overall level of  0.29 µg/m 3 [0.13 ppb] (Higashino et al ., 
2006). 
Mainstream and sidestream cigarette smoke contain approx imately 20–40 µg and 80–
130 µg butadiene per cigarette, respectively; levels of bu tadiene in smoky indoor environ-
ments are typically 10–20 µg/m 3 [5–9 ppb] (IARC, 2004). 
Based on its physical and chemical properties, buta diene is unlikely to be detected in 
water or in soil (Agency for Toxic Substances and D isease Registry, 1992). 
1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
Occupational exposure limits and guidelines for but adiene in several countries, 
regions or organizations are given in Table 17. 
The government of the United Kingdom has imposed an  air quality standard for 
butadiene of 2.25 µg/m 3 [1.00 ppb] to be achieved by December 2003 (runnin g annual 
mean) (AEA Energy & Environment, 2002).

2.     Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Background 
Over the last 30 years, the relationship between ex posure to butadiene and cancer in 
human populations has been investigated in numerous  studies. The most relevant 
investigations focused on working populations who w ere employed in butadiene 
monomer and styrene–butadiene rubber production. 
Three independent cohorts of monomer production wor kers in the USA have been 
studied: at two Union Carbide plants in West Virgin ia (Ward et al ., 1995), at a Texaco 
plant in Texas (Divine & Hartman, 2001) and at a Sh ell plant in Texas (Tsai et al ., 2001).  1,3-BUTADIENE 69  
 
 Two independent groups of styrene–butadiene rubber production workers have been 
studied. One was studied by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH) in a two-plant complex in Ohio, USA (McMich ael et al ., 1974, 1976; 
Meinhardt et al. , 1982), and the other comprised workers from eight  facilities in the USA 
and Canada who were studied by researchers from the  Johns Hopkins’ University 
(Matanoski & Schwartz, 1987; Matanoski et al. , 1990, 1993). 
Subsequently, researchers from the University of Al abama at Birmingham (Delzell et 
al . 1996) studied the two-plant complex originally in vestigated by NIOSH plus seven of 
the eight plants studied by the Johns Hopkins’ Univ ersity. The Johns Hopkins’ researchers 
also conducted nested case–control studies within t his working population (Santos-
Burgoa et al. , 1992; Matanoski et al. , 1997). The University of Alabama at Birmingham 
group recently updated the follow-up of the cohort and revised and refined their assess-
ment of exposures both to butadiene and to possible  confounding co-exposures (Macaluso 
et al ., 2004). A number of largely overlapping publicati ons from these groups have been 
reviewed. The most recent results were published by  Graff et al . (2005), Sathiakumar et 
al . (2005), and Cheng et al . (2007). 
In addition to industry-based studies, a population -based case–control study in 
Canada (Parent et al ., 2000) and a cohort study of students at a high s chool adjacent to a 
styrene–butadiene rubber production plant in the US A (Loughlin et al ., 1999) are also 
reviewed here. 
Overall, the available studies focused consistently  on a possible increased risk for 
neoplasms of the lymphatic and haematopoietic syste m from exposure to butadiene. 
Epidemiological studies of cancer and exposure to b utadiene are summarized in 
Table 18. 
2.2 Industry-based studies 
2.2.1  Monomer production 
A cohort mortality study included men who were assi gned to any of three butadiene 
production units located within several chemical pl ants in the Kanawha Valley of West 
Virginia, USA. Of the 364 men included in the study , 277 (76%) were employed in a 
‘Rubber Reserve’ plant that operated during the Sec ond World War (Ward et al ., 1995). 
The plants produced butadiene from ethanol or from olefin cracking. The butadiene 
production units included in this study were select ed from an index of chemical 
departments that was developed by the Union Carbide  Corporation and included only 
departments where butadiene was a primary product a nd neither benzene nor ethylene 
oxide was present. The cohort studied was part of a  large cohort of 29 139 chemical 
workers whose mortality experience had been reported ear lier, although without regard to 
specific exposures (Rinsky et al ., 1988). Three subjects were lost to follow-up (0. 8%). 
Mortality from all cancers was not increased (48 de aths; standardized mortality ratio 
[SMR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 8–1.4) . Seven deaths from lymphatic and 70 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 haematopoietic cancers occurred (SMR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.7–3.6), including four cases of 
lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma (SMR, 5.8; 95% CI , 1.6–14.8). Three cases had a 
duration of employment of 2 years or more (SMR, 8.3;  p < 0.05). Two cases of leukaemia 
(SMR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.2–4.4) also occurred. A non-si gnificant excess of mortality from 
stomach cancer was observed (SMR, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.8– 5.7). All five cases of stomach 
cancer occurred among the subset of workers who had  been employed in the ‘Rubber 
Reserve’ plant for 2 years or more (SMR, 6.6; 95% C I, 2.1–15.3).  
The mortality of a cohort of workers who manufactur ed butadiene monomer in Texas, 
USA (Downs et al ., 1987), has been investigated repeatedly with upd ated and extended 
follow-up (Divine, 1990; Divine et al ., 1993; Divine & Hartman, 1996). The latest avail-
able update, that included 5 additional years of fo llow-up up to 31 December 1999, was 
reported by Divine and Hartman (2001). The cohort a t that time included 2800 male 
workers (of whom 216 were non-white and 10 were of unknown race) who had been 
employed for at least 6 months between 1943 and 199 6. Exposure assessment was based 
on job history and industrial hygiene sampling data for the  years after 1981. Each job was 
assigned a score for exposure to butadiene that too k into account calendar period and type 
of operation. No information was reported on exposur e to chemicals other than butadiene. 
The number of workers lost to follow-up was 192 (6. 7%), all but 17 (< 1%) of whom 
were known to be alive at the end of 1998. A total of 1422 deat hs were identified through 
to 1999, and death certificates were obtained for a ll but 19 (1.3%) of the deaths. SMRs 
were calculated using mortality rates for the US popu lation as the reference. The SMR for 
all causes of death was 0.9 (95% CI, 0.8–0.9) and t hat for all cancers (333 deaths) was 0.9 
(95% CI, 0.8–1.0). Fifty deaths from lymphatic and haemat opoietic cancers (International 
Classification of Diseases [ICD]-8, 200–209; SMR, 1 .4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.9), nine deaths 
from lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma (ICD-8, 200;  SMR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.9–3.9), 19 
deaths from non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ICD-8, 200, 202; SMR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.9–2.3), four 
deaths from Hodgkin lymphoma (ICD-8, 201; SMR, 1.6;  95% CI, 0.4–4.1), 18 deaths 
from leukaemia (ICD-8, 204–207; SMR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0 .8–2.0), seven deaths from mul-
tiple myeloma (ICD-8, 203; SMR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.5–2. 6) and 18 deaths from cancer of 
other lymphatic tissue (ICD-8, 202, 203, 208; SMR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8–2.1) were observed. 
However, the latter category overlapped with non-Ho dgkin lymphoma and multiple 
myeloma. The SMRs for the lymphatic and haematopoie tic cancers did not increase with 
length of employment. Analysis by date of employmen t showed an increased risk for 
lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers among those fi rst employed between 1942 and 
1949. A separate mortality analysis for non-whites showed lower than expected mortality 
for all malignant neoplasms (17 observed, 19 expect ed) and a single death from lymphatic 
and haematopoietic cancer. Subcohort analyses were made  for groups that were classified 
as having background, low and varied exposure. The background-exposure group in-
cluded persons in offices, transportation, utilitie s and warehouses; the low-exposure group 
had spent some time in operating units; and the var ied-exposure group included those 
with greatest potential exposure in operating units , laboratories and maintenance. In the 
background-exposure group, four deaths from lymphat ic and haematopoietic cancers  1,3-BUTADIENE 81  
 
 (ICD-8, 200–209) were observed among those employed  for < 5 years (SMR, 1.9; 95% 
CI, 0.5–4.7) and four among those exposed for > 5 y ears (SMR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.5–4.3). 
Eleven deaths from lymphatic and haematopoietic can cers (ICD-8, 200–209) were 
observed in the low-exposure group, seven of which were among those with < 5 years of 
employment (SMR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4–1.9) and four amo ng those employed for > 5 years 
(SMR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.2–1.6). In the varied-exposure  group, with the highest potential for 
exposure to butadiene, 34 deaths from lymphatic and  haematopoietic cancers (ICD-8, 
200–209) were observed, 20 of which were among thos e employed for < 5 years (SMR, 
1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–2.8) and 14 among those exposed fo r > 5 years (SMR, 1.5; 95% CI, 
0.8–2.5). In all groups, the SMRs for lymphatic and  haematopoietic cancer decreased 
with duration of employment. For lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma, two deaths 
occurred in the low-exposure group (one among those  employed < 5 years and one 
among those employed > 5 years) and seven deaths were obse rved in the varied-exposure 
group, five of which were among those employed for < 5 years (SMR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2–
8.7) and two among those employed for > 5 years (SM R, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.23–6.76). 
Three deaths from leukaemia occurred (SMR, 0.7; 95%  CI, 0.1–2.0) in the low-exposure 
subgroup and 13 cases were observed in the varied-e xposure group, eight of which were 
among those employed for < 5 years (SMR, 1.9; 95% C I, 0.8–3.7) and five among those 
employed > 5 years (SMR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.4–3.2). Six  deaths from non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma were observed in the low-exposure group, f our among short-term employees 
(SMR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.4–3.8) and two among those emp loyed for > 5 years (SMR, 0.9; 
95% CI, 0.1–3.2), and 12 deaths occurred in the var ied-exposure group, eight of which 
were among those employed for < 5 years (SMR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.9–3.9) and four among 
long-term employees (SMR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.3–2.9). Th e ‘varied-exposure’ group with 
high potential for exposure to butadiene showed ele vated SMR estimates for all 
subcategories of lymphatic and haematopoietic cance rs, but the increase was statistically 
significant only for lympho/reticulosarcoma among t hose employed for < 5 years. 
Slightly elevated SMRs were also found in the low-e xposure group for cancer of the 
kidney (three cases; SMR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.3–4.6; and  three cases; SMR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.4–
5.4; among short- and long-term employees, respecti vely). In the varied-exposure group, 
a suggestive excess incidence of kidney cancer was only present among those employed 
for > 5 years (four cases; SMR, 1.65; 95% CI, 0.45– 4.22). Survival analysis by Cox 
regression was carried out using a cumulative expos ure score as a time-dependent 
explanatory variable for all lymphohaematopoietic n eoplasms, non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
and leukaemia. None of these cancers was significan tly associated with the cumulative 
exposure score. The elevated risk for all the lymph ohaematopoietic cancers and their 
subcategories occurred among persons who were first  employed before 1950. [The 
Working Group noted that although there was no evid ence of an exposure–response 
relationship, it is probable that many workers duri ng the years of the Second World War 
would have had short but relatively intense exposures, and  thus duration of exposure may 
not be the most relevant dose metric.] 82 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 Another relatively small retrospective mortality st udy, together with a prospective 
morbidity survey, was performed on male employees a t the Shell Deer Park 
Manufacturing Complex in the USA (Cowles et al ., 1994) and was updated with a 9-year 
extension of the follow-up (Tsai et al ., 2001). Butadiene monomer production took place 
in the facility between 1941 and 1948 and from 1970 o nwards. The cohort comprised 614 
eligible male employees who had worked for 5 years or more in jobs that entailed 
potential exposure to butadiene. Also eligible were  employees who had worked for at 
least half of their total duration of employment du ring 1948–89 in a job that entailed 
potential exposure to butadiene (with a minimum 3-m onth period in such jobs). Female 
employees were excluded because of the small number  (35) who met the eligibility 
criteria. Industrial hygiene data from 1979 to 1992  showed that few exposures to buta-
diene exceeded 10 ppm [22 mg/m 3] as an 8-h TWA and that most were below 1 ppm [2.2 
mg/m 3]; the arithmetic mean exposure was 3.5 ppm [7.7 mg/m 3]. Only one study member 
had unknown vital status at the end of the follow-u p. Person–years were accrued after 
1 April 1948 from the time that a person first met the eligib ility criteria. Death certificates 
were obtained for all known decedents. SMRs adjuste d for age, race and calendar year 
were calculated using county-specific mortality rat es as the reference. Six hundred and 
fourteen cohort members contributed a total of 12 3 91 person–years during the expanded 
study period, during which 61 deaths were identifie d. The SMR for all causes of death 
was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.42–0.70) and that for all malig nant neoplasms was 0.6 (16 deaths; 
95% CI, 0.3–0.9). Eight deaths were due to lung cancer (SMR,  0.7; 95% CI, 0.2–3.1) and 
three to cancer of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues (SMR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.3–1.5). 
No deaths from leukaemia were observed, whereas one  death was expected. The 
morbidity study included 289 of the 614 cohort memb ers who were actively employed at 
some time between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 19 98. The morbidity experience of 
this group was compared with that of an internal co mparison group of 1386 active 
employees during the same period who had had no exp osure to butadiene. A morbidity 
event was defined as an absence from work of > 5 da ys during 1992–98 that resulted from 
a specific diagnosed disorder. No meaningful differences  in morbidity events between the 
butadiene-exposed and unexposed employees in the re st of the Shell Deer Park Manu-
facturing Complex were observed. [The Working Group  noted that one criteria for in-
clusion in the cohort (at least half of total emplo yment during 1948–89 in a potentially 
exposed job) was a potential source of bias, and th at the SMR for all causes was un-
usually low.] 
2.2.2  Styrene–butadiene rubber production  
The 9-year mortality experience of a cohort of 6678  male rubber workers from a 
single, large tyre manufacturing plant in Ohio, USA , approximately 4% of whom worked 
in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, was investi gated during 1964–72 (McMichael et 
al ., 1974, 1976). Death rates from various specific c auses were increased and included 
lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers in general (43  observed deaths; SMR, 1.36),  1,3-BUTADIENE 83  
 
 lymphosarcoma and Hodgkin lymphoma (15 observed; SM R, 1.64) and leukaemia (17 
observed; SMR, 1.26). A case–cohort study was neste d within the cohort to investigate 
the association of excesses of mortality with speci fic jobs within the rubber industry to 
compare workers who died from cancers in the 10-yea r period 1964–73 with a sample of 
members of the whole cohort and to elucidate differ ences in work histories (McMichael et 
al ., 1976). A 6.2-fold increase in risk for lymphatic  and haematopoietic cancers (99.9% 
CI, 4.1–12.5) and a 3.9-fold increase in risk for l ymphatic leukaemia (99.9% CI, 2.6–8.0) 
were found in association with more than 5 years of  work in manufacturing units that 
produced mainly styrene–butadiene rubber during 194 0–60. [The Working Group noted 
that no information was provided on exposure to specific su bstances including potentially 
confounding chemicals such as benzene.]  
Meinhardt et al . (1982) studied the mortality experience of white male workers who 
had been employed for at least 6 months in a two-pl ant complex styrene–butadiene rubber 
facility in the USA. A total of 1662 workers employed in Plant A between 1943 and 1976 
and 1094 workers employed in Plant B between 1950 a nd 1976 were followed up through 
to 31 March 1976. Nine deaths from cancer of the ly mphatic and haematopoietic tissues 
(ICD-7, 200–205) were seen in workers in Plant A (S MR, 1.6). The SMR among those 
from Plant A who were first employed between Januar y 1943 and December 1945 was 
2.1. Five deaths from leukaemia (ICD-7, 204) were o bserved in Plant A among workers 
employed between 1943 and 1945 (SMR, 2.8). In Plant B, two deaths from lymphatic and 
haematopoietic neoplasms (one lymphosarcoma/reticul osarcoma and one leukaemia) 
were observed.  
Matanoski et al.  (1990) investigated mortality patterns from 1943 ( synthetic rubber 
production began in 1942) through to 1982 among 12 113 employees at styrene–buta-
diene rubber plants in Canada and the USA who had p reviously been followed up through 
to 1979 by Matanoski and Schwartz (1987). Overall, there were no increases in mortality 
from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers. When emp loyees were classified according 
to their longest-held job, production workers (pres umed by the authors to be those with 
highest exposures to butadiene) had a significant e xcess of ‘other lymphatic cancer’ (nine 
deaths; SMR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.19–4.94). When mortali ty among production workers was 
examined by race, a significant excess for leukaemi a was seen in blacks (three deaths; 
SMR, 6.56; 95% CI, 1.35–19.06). Of 92 deaths among black production workers, six 
were from all lymphohaemopoietic cancers (SMR, 5.07 ; 95% CI, 1.87–11.07).  
Nested case–control studies were conducted within t he styrene–butadiene rubber 
cohort in the USA and Canada (Santos-Burgoa et al. , 1992; Matanoski et al ., 1997). In 
the study by Santos-Burgoa et al . (1992), 59 cases of lymphatic and haematopoietic 
cancer in male workers (1943–82) were matched to 19 3 controls by plant, age, year of 
hire, duration of employment and survival to time o f death of the case. Each job was 
assigned an estimated rank of exposure to butadiene and sty rene, and cumulated exposure 
for each worker was calculated using employment his tories. A strong association was 
identified for both butadiene (odds ratio, 9.4; 95%  CI, 2.1–22.9) and styrene (odds ratio, 
3.1; 95% CI, 0.8–11.2). After controlling for the o ther exposure, the odds ratio for 84 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 exposure to butadiene remained high and significant  (odds ratio, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.3–41.3) 
whereas the relative risk estimate for styrene was approximately unity (odds ratio, 1.1; 
95% CI, 0.23–4.95). 
Matanoski et al.  (1997) conducted a second case–control study that was nested in the 
styrene–butadiene cohort and included as cases most of the  same lymphatic and haemato-
poietic cancer decedents studied by Santos-Burgoa et al.  (1992). In this study, hospital 
records obtained for 55 of the 59 cases studied by Santos-Burgoa et al.  (1992) were re-
viewed to confirm death certificate reports of lymp hatic and haematopoietic cancer. The 
review confirmed all leukaemias, eliminated two cas es and added one case of non-
Hodgkin lymphoma and confirmed all cases of Hodgkin  lymphoma and multiple 
myeloma. The final case groups included 58 total ly mphatic and haematopoietic cancers, 
12 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (seven lymphosarcomas and five other non-Hodgkin 
lymphomas), eight Hodgkin lymphomas, 26 leukaemias and 10 multiple myelomas. 
Controls were 1242 employees who were chosen to ref lect the distribution of the cohort 
by plant and age, who had to have lived at least as  long as cases and who represented 
approximately 1% of the cohort, but were not matche d individually to cases. Quantitative 
exposure estimates for butadiene and styrene were d eveloped by using exposure 
measurements for work areas and jobs, when availabl e, and a modelling procedure to 
obtain estimates for jobs that had no measurements.  Plant- and work area-specific 
exposure estimates were linked to work histories to obtain  indices of cumulative exposure 
(ppm–months) and average intensity of exposure (ppm ). Odds ratios for an average 
intensity of exposure of 1 ppm compared with 0 ppm and for ppm–months as a con-
tinuous variable were estimated using logarithmical ly transformed exposure data in 
unconditional logistic regression models that contr olled for year of birth, period of hire, 
age at hire, race and length of employment. Leukaem ia and Hodgkin lymphoma were 
associated positively with average intensity of expo sure to butadiene (odds ratio at 1 ppm: 
leukaemia, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07–2.10; Hodgkin lymphom a, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.99–3.02) and 
with ppm–months of exposure to butadiene. Non-Hodgk in lymphoma and multiple 
myeloma were associated positively with average int ensity of exposure and cumulative 
exposure to styrene but not with indices of exposur e to butadiene. Further analyses 
indicated that, in models that included both averag e intensity of exposure to butadiene and 
an indicator for longest employment in service, lab our and laboratory work areas, both 
variables were statistically significantly, positiv ely associated with leukaemia. Separate 
analyses of lymphoid leukaemia (10 cases) and myelo id leukaemia (15 cases) found that 
the average intensity of exposure to butadiene, but  not work area, was significantly 
associated with lymphoid leukaemia. Average intensi ty of exposure to butadiene and 
work area were both associated positively with myel oid leukaemia, but the association 
was significant only for work area. Matanoski et al.  (1997) suggested that misclassi-
fication of quantitative indices of exposure to but adiene could explain the latter results.  
Delzell et al . (1996) and Sathiakumar et al . (1998) evaluated the mortality experience 
of 15 649 men (87% white and 13% black) who had bee n employed for at least 1 year at 
any of eight styrene–butadiene rubber plants in the  USA and Canada and who had  1,3-BUTADIENE 85  
 
 worked in styrene–butadiene rubber-related operations in  these plants. Seven of the plants 
had been studied previously by Matanoski and Schwar tz (1987), Matanoski et al . (1990), 
Santos-Burgoa et al.  (1992) and Matanoski et al .(1993, 1997); the two-plant complex 
studied earlier by Meinhardt et al . (1982) and Lemen et al.  (1990) was also included. 
Complete work histories were available for 97% of t he subjects: about 75% was exposed 
to butadiene and 83% was exposed to styrene. A list  was developed to identify every 
combination of work area and job title, for a total  of 8281 unique combinations. Using 
information from the plant on processes and operati ons and on jobs and tasks within each 
type of operation, 308 groups of work area were spe cified, and comprised processes and 
jobs that were considered to be similar. For analys is, these were further classified into five 
main process groups and seven process subgroups. Du ring 1943–91, the cohort had a total 
of 386 172 person–years of follow-up and 734 individuals wer e lost to follow-up (5%). A 
total of 3976 deaths were observed compared with 45 53 deaths expected on the basis of 
general population mortality rates for the USA or ( for the Canadian subcohort) Ontario 
(SMR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.85–0.90). Mortality from cancer was s lightly lower than expected 
(950 deaths; SMR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87–0.99). Eleven lymphosarcomas were observed 
(SMR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.40–1.40) and 42 ‘other lympho poietic cancers’ (SMR, 0.97; 95% 
CI, 0.70–1.52) which included 17 non-Hodgkin lympho mas, eight Hodgkin lymphomas, 
14 multiple myelomas, one polycythaemia vera and tw o myelofibroses. In addition, 48 
deaths from leukaemia were observed in the full coh ort (SMR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.97–1.74), 
including 45 among ‘ever hourly paid’ (86% of the cohort) sub jects (SMR, 1.43; 95% CI, 
1.04–1.91). The excess was fairly consistent across  plants and was concentrated among 
‘ever hourly paid’ subjects with 10 or more years o f employment and 20 or more years 
since hire (28 deaths; SMR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.49–3.23 ) and among polymerization workers 
(15 deaths; SMR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.40–4.14), maintena nce labourers (13 deaths; SMR, 
2.65; 95% CI, 1.41–4.53) and laboratory workers (10  deaths; SMR, 4.31; 95% CI, 2.07–
7.93). Polymerization workers and maintenance labou rers had potentially high exposure 
to butadiene but only low-to-moderate exposure to s tyrene. Sathiakumar et al . (1998) 
reported that, among subjects with ≥ 10 years of employment and ≥ 20 years since hire, 
moderately non-significantly increased mortality fr om non-Hodgkin lymphoma was also 
apparent (15 deaths; SMR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.77–2.26),  but without any consistent pattern 
by duration of employment, time since hire, period of hire or process group. Mortality 
from other types/sites of cancer was not significan tly elevated in this cohort. 
Macaluso et al . (1996) reported an additional analysis, with more  detailed exposure 
assessment, of mortality from leukaemia among 16 61 0 subjects (12 412 exposed to 
butadiene) employed at six of the eight North Ameri can styrene–butadiene rubber manu-
facturing plants investigated by Delzell et al.  (1996) [14 295 workers were included but a 
further 2350 workers from the same plants who were not employed in styrene–butadiene 
rubber operations at those plants were not included  in Delzell et al . (1996)]. A total of 
418 846 person–years of follow-up through 1991 and 58 leukaemia deaths, seven of 
which were reported to be the contributory (‘underl ying’) cause of death, were included 
only in analyses that used internal comparisons. Re trospective quantitative estimates of 86 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 exposure to butadiene, styrene and benzene were dev eloped and the estimation procedure 
identified work areas within each manufacturing pro cess, historical changes in exposure 
potential and specific tasks that involved exposure . Mathematical models were then used 
to calculate job- and time period-specific average exposu res. The resulting estimates were 
linked with work histories to obtain cumulative exposure e stimates that were employed in 
stratified and Poisson regression analyses of morta lity rates. Mantel-Haenszel rate ratios 
adjusted by race, age and cumulative exposure to st yrene increased with cumulative 
exposure to butadiene from 1.0 in the unexposed cat egory through to 2.0, 2.1, 2.4 and 4.5 
in the estimated exposure categories 0, < 1, 1–19, 20–79 and ≥ 80 ppm–years, respec-
tively ( p for trend = 0.01). The trend of increasing risk wi th exposure to butadiene was 
still significant after exclusion of the unexposed category ( p = 0.03). The risk pattern was 
less clear and statistically non-significant for ex posure to styrene (rate ratios, 0.9, 5.4, 3.4 
and 2.7 in the estimated exposure categories of < 5 , 5–9, 10–39 and ≥ 40 ppm–years, 
respectively; p for trend = 0.14) and the association with benzene  disappeared after 
controlling for exposure to butadiene and styrene.  
Irons and Pyatt (1998) suggested that apparently di fferent patterns of risk for 
leukaemia between workers employed in butadiene mon omer production and those 
involved in styrene–butadiene rubber production mig ht be linked to a class of chemicals 
with haematotoxic and immunotoxic potential (dithio carbamates) that were present in 
styrene–butadiene rubber but not butadiene monomer production. In particular, they 
suggested that dimethyldithiocarbamate, which was u sed between the early 1950s and 
1965 in the majority of styrene–butadiene rubber pl ants as a stopping agent in the cold 
polymerization reaction, might confound an associati on between butadiene and leukaemia 
in exposed workers. 
A further analysis was then conducted among the Nor th American synthetic rubber 
industry workers to evaluate the relative relevance  of butadiene, styrene and dimethyl-
dithiocarbamate in the statistically significantly increased risk for mortality from 
leukaemia (Delzell et al ., 2001). The analysis included 13 130 men who had been 
employed for at least 1 year during 1943–91 at any of six synthetic rubber plants (of the 
eight previously studied by Delzell et al . (1996) and Sathiakumar et al . (1998)) that had 
sufficient information for quantitative exposure es timation. Revised exposure estimates 
for butadiene and styrene and new quantitative esti mates for dimethyldithiocarbamate 
were developed (Macaluso et al ., 2004). Quantitative estimates of cumulative expo sure 
were obtained by ( a) identifying work area/job groups (‘jobs’) that co nsisted of homo-
geneous work activities; ( b) identifying the tasks that comprised each job; ( c) identifying 
historical changes in exposure potential for each t ask; ( d) computing time period-specific 
average exposure concentrations in parts per millio n for tasks and jobs; ( e) compiling the 
job-specific estimates into a job–exposure matrix f or each plant; and ( f) linking the 
resulting job–exposure matrices with work histories  to obtain cumulative exposure 
estimates. The job–exposure matrix contained plant- specific estimates of 8-h TWA 
exposure concentrations for butadiene and other che micals for each job and for each year 
from 1943 through to 1991. Mathematical models were  used to calculate plant-, task-,  1,3-BUTADIENE 87  
 
 work area/job group- and time period-specific avera ge exposures. The revised TWA 
exposure estimates, compared with the original esti mates, were about four to six times 
higher for butadiene and two times higher for styre ne. Estimates of the annual number of 
peaks of exposure in each job (i.e. for each job, t he number of component tasks in which 
intensity exceeded 100 ppm for butadiene and 50 ppm  for styrene) were also computed. 
Vital status at the end of 1991 was known for over 99% of subjects. A total of 234 416 
person–years of observation (average, 18 person–yea rs per subject) were accrued during 
the follow-up period and included in the analysis. Informa tion from death certificates was 
available for 3813 (98%) of 3892 decedents; the dea th certificates of 58 decedents 
mentioned leukaemia as the underlying or contributi ng cause of death. For 48 of these, 
medical records confirmed that they had had leukaem ia; for 10, medical records were not 
available and these were retained in the case group . An additional decedent had medical 
records that indicated leukaemia but the death cert ificate mentioned myelodysplasia: he 
was added to the case group (total, 59 decedents). Po isson regression analysis was used to 
estimate relative rates of mortality from leukaemia  and their 95% CIs for a particular 
agent/exposure category compared with the category of workers who were unexposed or 
had low exposure; regression models for each agent took into account the level of 
exposure, age, years since hire and, in some models , co-exposure to one or both of the 
other chemicals. In some analyses, exposure was lag ged under the assumption that 
exposures that occurred within 5 or 10 years before  death were etiologically irrelevant. 
Mortality from leukaemia showed a consistently posi tive association with increasing 
exposure to butadiene (relative rate, 1.0; 1.2; 95%  CI, 0.5–3.0; 2.0; 95% CI 0.8–4.8; and 
3.8; 95% CI, 1.6–9.1; for exposure to 0, 0–86.3, 86 .3–362.2 and ≥ 362.2 ppm–years, 
respectively) [ p for trend < 0.001] and to styrene (relative rate, 1.0; 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5–3.3; 
2.3; 95% CI, 0.9–6.2; and 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2–8.8; for  exposure to 0, 0–20.6, 20.6–60.4 and 
≥ 60.4 ppm–years, respectively) [ p for trend = 0.001]. Exposure to dimethyldithio-
carbamate also showed consistently increased relati ve rates, but with no monotonic trend. 
After controlling for exposure to styrene and dimet hyldithiocarbamate as well as for age 
and years since hire, exposure to butadiene remaine d consistently but not statistically 
significantly associated with increasing mortality from leukaemia (relative rate, 1.0; 1.3; 
95% CI, 0.4–4.3; 1.3; 95% CI, 0.4–4.6; and 2.3; 95%  CI, 0.6–8.3) [ p for trend = 0.250].  
When exposure to total peaks (> 100 ppm for butadie ne and > 50 ppm for styrene) 
was used in the analysis, a positive association of  exposure to butadiene and styrene with 
mortality from leukaemia was again apparent; adjust ments for other agents made the 
associations irregular and imprecise. Lagging for a  5- or 10-year exposure period did not 
alter the results materially. Models were also run to estimate relative rates for leukaemia 
for exposures to butadiene calculated at intensitie s of < 100 ppm and > 100 ppm. In the 
former analysis, a statistically non-significant tr end of increasing relative rate with 
increasing number of butadiene ppm–years was found (relative rate, 1.0; 1.1; 95% CI, 
0.5–2.7; 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2–6.8; and 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2–7.1; f or exposure to 0, 0–37.8, 37.8–
96.3 and ≥ 96.3 ppm–years, respectively; p for trend = 0.25), whereas the trend for 
exposure to > 100 ppm was statistically significant  (relative rate, 1.0; 2.1; 95% CI, 0.9–88 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 5.1; 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2–6.7; and 5.8; 95% CI, 2.4–13. 8; for exposure to 0, 0–46.5, 46.5–
234.3 and ≥ 234.3 ppm–years, respectively; p for trend = 0.01). Analyses based on 
quartiles or quintiles of exposure yielded patterns  of results similar to those seen in the 
analyses based on tertiles shown above. Exposure to  butadiene and dimethyldithio-
carbamate was further categorized to study interact ion, but no clear interaction between 
the two agents was apparent. The analysis confirmed  a significant, although weaker, 
association with exposure to butadiene even after c ontrolling for dimethyldithio-
carbamate: the relative rate for leukaemia for expo sure to 0–38.7, 38.7–287.3 and 
≥ 287.3 ppm–years of butadiene was, respectively, 1. 0, 1.5 (95% CI, 0.8–2.9) and 3.4 
(95% CI, 1.8–6.4) when unadjusted for exposure to d imethyldithiocarbamate ( p for trend 
= 0.0001) and 1.0, 1.0 (95% CI, 0.5–2.1) and 2.0 (9 5% CI, 0.9–4.3) when adjusted for 
exposure to dimethyldithiocarbamate ( p for trend = 0.007). Dimethyldithiocarbamate was 
associated with a non-monotonically increasing risk  and the trend was statistically non-
significant after controlling for butadiene. The re lative rate for exposure to 0–342.4, 
342.4–1222.6 and ≥ 1222.6 mg–years/cm of dimethyldithiocarbamate was,  respectively, 
1.0, 3.6 (95% CI, 1.9–6.7) and 2.9 (95% CI, 1.5–5.3 ) when unadjusted for exposure to 
butadiene ( p for trend = 0.003) and 1.0, 3.2 (95% CI, 1.6–6.3) a nd 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0–4.4) 
when adjusted for exposure to butadiene ( p for trend = 0.196). A similar analysis was 
conducted for co-exposure to butadiene and styrene.  The marginal trend was consistent 
and statistically significant for exposure to butad iene adjusted for styrene ( p for trend = 
0.006), but not for styrene adjusted for butadiene ( p for trend = 0.763). Analyses by 
specific subgroups of leukaemia were conducted but sparse data rendered the results 
largely uninformative. [The Working Group noted the diffi culties in estimating exposures 
to dimethyldithiocarbamate, which are primarily der mal, and that substantial mis-
classification of exposure to this chemical was pos sible. Furthermore, the assessment of 
exposure to dimethyldithiocarbamate was performed w ith the knowledge of which 
departments had excess mortality from leukaemia and  could conceivably have been 
biased by this knowledge.]  
Mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer in the updated North American 
cohort was studied in relation to exposure to butad iene, styrene and 
dimethyldithiocarbamate (Graff et al ., 2005). Two of the US plants were not included in  
this analysis because information on work area/job group was not sufficient for 
quantitative exposure estimation for all substances . Included were 16 579 men who had 
worked at any of the six study plants for at least 1 year by the end of 1991 and who were 
followed up between 1944 and 1998. All work histories and exp osure data came from the 
previous study of Delzell et al . (2001), and exposure estimation procedures were t hose 
described by Macaluso et al . (2004). Information on vital status through to 19 98 was 
established for 97% of the study group. Cause of de ath was ascertained through death 
certificates, the national death index and a search  of medical records. Most analyses used 
Poisson regression models to obtain maximum likelihood e stimates of the relative rate for 
the contrast between categories of one agent, adjus ting for other agents and for additional 
potential confounders. SMR analyses by level of exp osure to the agent were also made  1,3-BUTADIENE 89  
 
 using state-specific US and Canadian male mortality  rates as the comparison group and 
data from death certificates and the national death  index only to determine causes of 
death. During the observation period, 500 174 perso n–years were accrued. Based on a 
review of medical records where possible, 81 deaths  from leukaemia, 58 from non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, 27 from multiple myeloma and 13 f rom Hodgkin disease were 
ascertained. Single-agent analyses, adjusting for a ge and years since hire, indicated a 
positive association between exposure to butadiene and leukaemia (relative risk, 1.0; 1.4; 
95% CI, 0.7–3.1; 1.2; 95% CI, 0.6–2.7; 2.9; 95% CI,  1.4–6.4; and 3.7; 95% CI, 1.7–8.0; 
for exposure to 0, 0–33.7, 33.7–184.7, 184.7–425.0 and ≥ 425.0 ppm–years, respectively) 
[p for trend < 0.001] and between exposure to styrene  and leukaemia (relative risk, 1.0, 
1.3; 95% CI, 0.6–3.2; 1.6; 95% CI, 0.7–3.9; 3.0; 95 % CI, 1.2–7.1; and 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1–
6.4; for exposure to 0, 0–8.3, 8.3–31.8, 31.8–61.1 and ≥ 61.1 ppm–years, respectively) 
[p for trend = 0.001]. Exposure to dimethyldithiocarb amate was also positively 
associated, but with no monotonic increase (relativ e risk, 1.0; 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2–5.0; 3.0; 
95% CI, 1.5–5.9; 4.9; 95% CI, 2.5–9.7; and 2.7; 95%  CI, 1.4–5.4; for exposure to 0, 0–
185.3, 185.3–739.4, 739.4–1610.3 and ≥ 1610.3 mg–years/cm, respectively) [ p for trend 
= 0.001]. Similar results were obtained for butadie ne and styrene when total peaks were 
used as exposure metrics. Exposures to butadiene, s tyrene and dimethyldithiocarbamate 
were found to be highly correlated. In the models that also  controlled for other agents, the 
estimated relative rates for the increasing categor ies of butadiene ppm–years were 1.0, 1.4 
(95% CI, 0.5–3.9), 0.9 (95% CI, 0.3–2.6), 2.1 (95% CI, 0.7–6.2) and 3.0 (95% CI, 1.0–
9.2) [ p for trend = 0.028]; for styrene, the association a ppeared to be negative [ p for trend 
= 0.639]; and for dimethyldithiocarbamate, a positi ve association was still apparent with 
no monotonic exposure–response pattern (relative ri sk, 1.0, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2–5.8; 3.1; 
95% CI, 1.4–7.1; 4.4; 95% CI, 1.9–10.2; and 2.0; 95 % CI, 0.8–4.8) [ p for trend = 0.066]. 
Individual adjustment for one or both of the other main exposure factors yielded similar 
results: the positive increasing association betwee n exposure to butadiene and leukaemia 
was slightly reduced; no association remained for s tyrene; dimethyldithiocarbamate still 
exhibited a positive association with leukaemia but  with no dose–response. Leukaemia 
was positively associated with butadiene ppm–years accrued at exposure intensities 
> 100 ppm and < 100 ppm. There was no evidence of a n interaction between butadiene 
and dimethyldithiocarbamate or between butadiene an d styrene. Analyses by histological 
type clearly showed an association of butadiene ppm –years with chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (relative risk, 1.0; 1.5; 95% CI, 0.6–4.0 ; 3.9; 95% CI, 1.3–11.0) [ p for trend = 
0.014], chronic myelogenous leukaemia (relative ris k, 1.0; 2.7; 95% CI, 0.7–10.4; 7.2; 
95% CI, 1.7–30.5) [ p for trend = 0.007] and other leukaemia (relative r isk, 1.0; 1.1; 95% 
CI, 0.3–3.9; 4.0; 95% CI, 1.0–15.0) [ p for trend = 0.060] for exposures to 0–33.7, 33.7–
425.0 and ≥ 425.0 ppm–years, respectively. No associations wer e found for non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, multiple myeloma or acute myelogenous leu kaemia. Results for a case series 
comprised of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non- Hodgkin lymphoma combined 
were similar to those for non-Hodgkin lymphoma alon e (Delzell et al ., 2006). External 
analyses that compared mortality rates of workers i n each cumulative exposure category 90 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 to the rate in the general population and controlle d for age, race and calendar year 
provided consistent results. 
The mortality follow-up of North American synthetic  rubber industry workers who 
had been employed for at least 1 year before 1 Janu ary 1992 at any of seven US and one 
Canadian styrene–butadiene rubber plants was later extended for a further 7 years from 
1991 through to the end of 1998 (Sathiakumar et al. , 2005) and included 17 924 subjects 
(15 583 white and 2341 non-white). Work histories p rovided information on each job 
held, a description of the work area and job and pa yroll classification. Analyses of data by 
work area were restricted to 15 612 subjects who ha d been employed in styrene–
butadiene rubber-related operations in the eight pl ants and classified into five major work 
areas: production, maintenance, labour, laboratorie s and other operations. For six of the 
eight plants (a total of 14 273 subjects), work histo ries were sufficiently detailed to permit 
further specification of three subgroups of work ar ea in production, two in maintenance 
and two in labour. Vital status was updated through  to 1998 and ascertained for 97% of 
the study group. In total, 570 (3%) subjects were l ost to follow-up. A total of 540 586 
person–years of observation were accrued. SMRs were calc ulated using mortality rates of 
the male population in Ontario (Canada) and in the three US states where the plants were 
located. The update added 83 401 person–years (18% increase), 1578 deaths (34%), 492 
deaths from cancer (44%) and 20 deaths from leukaem ia (39%) to those of the previous 
study. Mortality from all causes was lower than tha t expected (6237 deaths; SMR, 0.86; 
95% CI, 0.84–0.88) as was mortality from all cancer s (1608 deaths; SMR, 0.92; 95% CI, 
0.88–0.97). Mortality from lymphatic and haematopoi etic cancer was slightly elevated 
(162 deaths; SMR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90–1.23); 12 deat hs from Hodgkin lymphoma yielded 
an SMR of 1.11 (95% CI, 0.58–1.95) and 71 deaths fro m leukaemia represented a modest 
excess above expectation (SMR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.91–1 .47). Mortality from non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma was as expected (53 deaths; SMR, 1.00; 95%  CI, 0.75–1.30) and that from 
multiple myeloma was lower than expected (26 deaths ; SMR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.62–1.40). 
No consistent patterns were observed when mortality  was analysed by ever/never hourly 
paid, by years since hire or by years worked. In th e overall study group, the excess 
mortality from leukaemia was concentrated among men  who had been hired in the 1950s 
(31 deaths; SMR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.01–2.11). The exce ss mortality from all leukaemias 
was highest among hourly paid workers (63 deaths; S MR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.94–1.57), 
especially among those who had 20–29 years since hi re and ≥ 10 years worked (19 
deaths; SMR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.56–4.03). Analysis by specific histological type was 
possible for 65 of the 71 leukaemias and for the 19 68–98 time period only. For all 
subjects included in this analysis, the SMR for all  forms of leukaemia (65 deaths) was 
1.26 (95% CI, 0.97–1.61), that for lymphocytic leuk aemia (19 deaths) was 1.28 (95% CI, 
0.77–2.00) and that for myelogenous leukaemia (28 d eaths) was 1.27 (95% CI, 0.84–
1.83). In the SMR analysis restricted to 1968–98, h ourly paid workers had an overall 
SMR for leukaemia (65 deaths) of 1.35 (95% CI, 1.03 –1.75), and the excess mortality 
was particularly marked among those who had 20–29 y ears since hire and ≥ 10 years 
worked (SMR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.68–4.49); a non-signif icant increase was seen for  1,3-BUTADIENE 91  
 
 lymphocytic leukaemia (four deaths; SMR, 2.33; 95% CI, 0.6 5–5.97), whereas the excess 
for myelogenous leukaemia was significant (nine deaths ; SMR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.46–6.07) 
and was stronger for the chronic myelogenous form ( six deaths; SMR, 6.55; 95% CI, 
2.40–14.26). Analysis by production work areas in t he whole cohort, with follow-up 
between 1944 and 1998, showed an association betwee n mortality from leukaemia and 
working in the following areas: polymerization (18 deaths; SMR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.21–
3.22), coagulation (10 deaths; SMR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1 .11–4.25) and finishing (19 deaths; 
SMR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.94–2.44); in maintenance labou r (15 deaths; SMR, 2.03; 95% CI, 
1.14–3.35); and in laboratories (14 deaths; SMR, 3. 26; 95% CI, 1.78–5.46). The excesses 
of mortality in production were mainly due to chron ic lymphatic leukaemia: 
polymerization (eight deaths; SMR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2. 15–9.80), coagulation (five deaths; 
SMR, 6.07; 95% CI, 1.97–14.17) and finishing (seven  deaths; SMR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.38–
7.09), whereas mortality from myelogenous leukaemia  was particularly high in 
maintenance labour (acute, five deaths; SMR, 2.95; 95% CI, 0.96–6.88) and in laboratory 
workers (total, six deaths; SMR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.22 –7.20; chronic, three deaths; SMR, 
5.22; 95% CI, 1.08–15.26).  
Cheng et al.  (2007) used Cox proportional hazard models on the set of data analysed 
by Graff et al . (2005) to examine further the exposure–response relation s between several 
butadiene exposure indices and leukaemia (81 decede nts), and to assess exposure–
response relations between butadiene and all lympho id neoplasms (120 decedents from 
lymphatic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple 
myeloma) and all myeloid neoplasms (56 decedents fr om myeloid and monocytic 
leukaemia, myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia, myeloprolife rative disorders and polycythemia 
vera). Cox regression techniques were considered to  permit estimation of the exposure–
response relations throughout the exposure range, t o provide optimal control of 
confounding by age and to be less affected by inter correlations among exposure variables. 
A subset of 488 subjects was excluded because they dropped out from follow-up at ages 
below that of the youngest leukaemia decedent. Pote ntial confounders for which the 
analyses controlled included dimethyldithiocarbamat e, race, plant, years since hire and 
year of birth. The butadiene exposure indices used in these analyses were: cumulative 
exposure in ppm–years, total number of exposures to  peaks (> 100 ppm) and average 
intensities of exposure in parts per million. All t hree exposure indices were associated 
positively with the risk for leukaemia. Penalized s pline regression indicated that the 
natural logarithm of the hazard ratio for leukaemia  increased in a fairly linear fashion in 
the exposure range below the 95th percentile for al l three indices. Analysis by decile of 
exposure to butadiene showed an irregular pattern o f estimated rate ratios. After 
controlling for all co-variates, estimated relative  rates by decile range of values exhibited 
a non-monotonic trend that was of borderline statis tical significance for ppm–years [ p for 
trend = 0.049], but not for exposure to peaks [ p for trend = 0.071] or average intensity of 
exposure [ p for trend = 0.433]. Models that used continuous ex posure variables indicated 
that, for butadiene ppm–years, the exposure–respons e relation with leukaemia was 
positive and statistically significant in all but t wo of the eight models evaluated. After 92 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 adjustment for all co-variates, the regression coef ficient β that estimated the slope of the 
exposure–response relation was 3.0 × 10 –4 (95% CI, 0.1 × 10 –4–5.8 × 10 –4; p = 0.04) in 
models that used continuous, untransformed ppm–year s, 5.8 × 10 –4 (95% CI, 0.5 × 10 –4–
11.1 × 10 –4; p = 0.03) in models that used mean scored deciles and  6.1 × 10 –4 ( p = 0.04) in 
models that used mean scored quintiles. The exposure –response trend for butadiene peaks 
and leukaemia was positive and statistically signific ant in all eight models. The regression 
coefficient β was 5.6 × 10 –5 (95% CI, 0.8 × 10 –5–10.4 × 10 –5; p = 0.02) in models that 
used continuous, untransformed butadiene peaks and 7.5 × 10 –5 (95% CI, 0.3 × 10 –5–14.7 
× 10 –5; p = 0.04) in models that used mean scored deciles of  butadiene peaks, after 
controlling for all covariates. The association of average intensity of exposure to 
butadiene with leukaemia was statistically signific ant only in the model that used the 
square-root transformation of parts per million but adiene. Lagging of exposure had a 
small impact on the value of the coefficients for t he three exposure variables. Lymphoid 
neoplasms were associated with the ppm–years exposu re index and myeloid neoplasms 
with exposure to peaks. However, neither of the relations w as statistically significant after 
control for covariates. Cumulative exposure to dime thyldithiocarbamate, when treated as 
a continuous variable, was not associated with leuk aemia in any of the models. The risk 
estimates for each quartile of cumulative exposure to dimethyldithiocarbamate were 
significantly increased, even after adjustment for cumulative exposure to butadiene, 
without, however, a monotonic trend. Relative rate es timates were, respectively, 2.4 (95% 
CI, 1.2–5.0), 2.9 (95% CI, 1.4–5.8), 4.5 (95% CI, 2 .2–8.9) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0–4.4) 
[p for trend = 0.458]. 
[The Working Group noted that, given the strong cor relation between original and 
revised estimates (Spearman’s r = 0.9) reported, the validation of the exposure es timates 
in one plant during 1977–91 (Sathiakumar & Delzell,  2007) showed that estimates from 
the most recent measurements were in general very c lose to measured exposures, 
especially for the styrene–butadiene rubber-related  job titles. The ranking of jobs had 
hardly changed from the first estimates (Macaluso et al. , 1996) to the adjusted estimates 
(Macaluso et al. , 2004). However, it is uncertain to what extent th is validation can be 
extrapolated to the other plants.] 
2.2.3  Other rubber production 
Bond et al.  (1992) reported a mortality study of 2904 male wor kers engaged in the 
development and manufacture of styrene-based produc ts, including styrene–butadiene 
latex, who were potentially exposed to styrene and related chemicals [including 
butadiene] for at least 1 year between 1937 and 197 1. The number of person–years of 
follow-up during 1970–86 for workers in this production was  11 754. In comparison with 
USA mortality rates, the SMR for all causes of deat h among styrene–butadiene latex 
workers was 0.9, based on 82 deaths. A total of 13 cancers were  observed (22.0 expected; 
SMR, 0.6), and no site had an SMR that exceeded uni ty. One death from lymphatic and 
haematopoietic cancers occurred, which was due to l eukaemia (ICD-8 204–207) versus  1,3-BUTADIENE 93  
 
 0.9 expected. [The Working Group noted the limited information relating to exposure to 
butadiene.] 
2.3 Population-based studies 
The risk for lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers w as evaluated among students of a 
high school in eastern Texas, USA, that was bound a t the rear by facilities that had 
produced synthetic styrene–butadiene rubber since 1943 ( Loughlin et al., 1999). A cohort 
of 15 043 students who had attended the school for at l east 3 consecutive months during a 
school year between 1963 and 1993 was constructed. In total, 338 graduates (241 men 
and 97 women) had died during the follow-up period of 1963–95, which were fewer than 
expected. The SMR for all lymphatic and haematopoie tic cancer was 1.64 (95% CI, 0.85 –
2.87) for men (12 observed deaths) and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.06–1.70) for women (two 
observed deaths). The SMR was higher for 1530 men wh o had attended the school for ≤ 2 
years than for the 6352 who had attended for ≥ 2 years. For the former group, the SMR 
for all lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer was 3.2 0 (95% CI, 0.87–8.20). 
A population-based case–control study in the Montré al area, Canada (Parent et al., 
2000), assessed the association between renal-cell carcinoma and a large number of 
occupational exposures among men aged 35–70 years b etween 1979 and 1985. Cases 
were identified at all large hospitals in the area and were histologically confirmed; case 
ascertainment was 95% complete. Comparison was carr ied out with two sets of controls: 
subjects with other types of cancer and people sele cted from the general population. 
Questionnaires on cancer risk factors that included  lifetime occupational history were 
administered. Relative risks were estimated by odds  ratios from unconditional logistic 
regression models. In the analysis, 142 cases, 533 population controls and 1900 other 
cancer controls were available. The odds ratio for exposure to ‘styrene–butadiene rubber’ 
was 2.1 (10 exposed cases; 95% CI, 1.1–4.2) after c ontrolling for age, family income, 
tobacco smoke and body mass index and 1.8 (95% CI, 0.9–3.7) after controlling for other 
occupational exposures. [The Working Group noted th at it was unclear what was meant 
by exposure to styrene–butadiene rubber.]  
3.    Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
3.1 Inhalation exposure 
3.1.1 Mouse 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F 1 mice, 8–9 weeks of age, were exposed by 
whole-body inhalation to 625 or 1250 ppm [1380 or 2 760 mg/m3] butadiene (minimum 
purity, > 98.9%) for 6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 60 weeks (males) or 61 weeks 
(females). Equal numbers of animals were sham-expos ed and served as controls. The 94 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 study was terminated after 61 weeks because of a hi gh incidence of lethal neoplasms in 
the exposed animals. Deaths were mainly due to mali gnant lymphomas. The numbers of 
survivors at 61 weeks were: males — 49/50 control, 11/50 low-dose and 7/50 high-dose; 
females — 46/50 control, 15/50 low-dose and 30/50 h igh-dose. As shown in Table 19, 
butadiene induced haemangiosarcomas that originated  in the heart and metastasized to 
various organs. The incidence of haemangiosarcomas of the heart in historical controls 
was extremely low (1/2372 males, 1/2443 females). O ther types of neoplasm for which 
the incidence was significantly increased (Fisher’s  exact test) in animals of each sex were 
malignant lymphomas, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas of the lung and 
papillomas or carcinomas of the forestomach. Tumour s that occurred with significantly 
increased incidence in females only included hepato cellular adenoma or carcinoma of the 
liver: 0/50 control, 2/47 ( p = 0.232) low-dose and 5/49 ( p = 0.027) high-dose; acinar-cell 
carcinoma of the mammary gland: 0/50 control, 2/49 low-dose  and 6/49 ( p = 0.012) high-
dose; and granulosa-cell tumours of the ovary: 0/49 contr ol, 6/45 ( p = 0.01) low-dose and 
12/48 ( p < 0.001) high-dose. Gliomas were observed in the b rain of one male mouse 
exposed to 1250 ppm and in two male mice exposed to  625 ppm butadiene (National 
Toxicology Program, 1984; Huff et al ., 1985).

Because of the reduced survival of mice in the init ial study, further studies were con-
ducted at lower exposure concentrations. In one stu dy, groups of 70–90 male and 70–90 
female B6C3F 1 mice, 6.5 weeks of age, were exposed by whole-body  inhalation to 0, 
6.25, 20, 62.5, 200 or 625 ppm [0, 14, 44, 138, 440  or 1380 mg/m 3] butadiene (purity, 
> 99%) for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for up to  2 years. Up to 10 animals per group 
were killed and evaluated after 40 and 65 weeks of exposure. Survival was significantly 
reduced ( p < 0.05) in all groups of mice exposed to 20 ppm or  higher; terminal survivors  1,3-BUTADIENE 95  
 
 were: males — 35/70 control, 39/70 at 6.25 ppm, 24/ 70 at 20 ppm, 22/70 at 62.5 ppm, 
3/70 at 200 ppm and 0/90 at 625 ppm; females — 37/7 0 control, 33/70 at 6.25 ppm, 24/70 
at 20 ppm, 11/70 at 62.5 ppm, 0/70 at 200 ppm and 0 /90 at 625 ppm. As shown in Table 
20, exposure to butadiene produced increases in bot h sexes in the incidence of lympho-
mas, heart haemangiosarcomas, lung alveolar/bronchi olar adenomas and carcinomas, 
forestomach papillomas and carcinomas, Harderian gl and adenomas and adenocarcino-
mas and hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. The  incidence of mammary gland 
adenocarcinomas and benign and malignant ovarian gr anulosa-cell tumours was increased 
in females. Lymphocytic lymphomas were seen as earl y as after 23 weeks of exposure 
and were the principal cause of death in male and f emale mice exposed to 625 ppm 
butadiene (Melnick et al ., 1990; National Toxicology Program, 1993).  
In the same study, a stop-exposure experiment was c onducted in which groups of 50 
male B6C3F 1 mice, 6.5 weeks of age, were exposed to butadiene (purity, > 99%) by 
whole-body inhalation for 6 h per day on 5 days per  week at concentrations of 200 ppm 
[440 mg/m 3] for 40 weeks, 312 ppm [690 mg/m 3] for 52 weeks, 625 ppm [1380 mg/m 3] 
for 13 weeks or 625 ppm [1380 mg/m 3] for 26 weeks. The multiple of the exposure 
concentration and duration of exposure (ppm–weeks) was approximately 8000 ppm–
weeks or 16 000 ppm–weeks for the exposure groups. After the exposures were ter-
minated, the animals were placed in control chamber s for up to 104 weeks after the 
beginning of treatment. A group of 70 males served as chamber controls (0 ppm). [The 
Working Group noted that this was the same control group as that used in the experiment 
described in the above paragraph.] Survival was reduced ( p < 0.05) in all exposed groups; 
the numbers of survivors at the end of the study we re 35 controls, nine exposed to 
200 ppm, one exposed to 312 ppm, five exposed to 62 5 ppm for 13 weeks and none 
exposed to 625 ppm for 26 weeks. As shown in Table 21, exposure to butadiene produced 
increases in the incidence of lymphomas, heart haem angiosarcomas, lung 
alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas, fores tomach papillomas and carcinomas, 
Harderian gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas, prepu tial gland carcinomas and kidney 
tubular adenomas. This exposure protocol revealed a dditional tumour sites in males 
(preputial gland and renal cortex). The incidence o f lymphocytic lymphoma was greater 
after exposure to higher concentrations of butadien e for a short time than after exposure to 
lower concentrations for an extended period (Melnic k et al ., 1990; National Toxicology 
Program, 1993). Brain neoplasms including two neuro blastomas and three gliomas were 
observed in mice exposed to 625 ppm for 13 or 26 we eks in the stop-exposure study 
(National Toxicology Program, 1993). Brain neoplasm s are rare and had never been seen 
in historical National Toxicology Program controls at the time of the study. [The Working 
Group noted that brain tumours are rare in mice and  were observed, although at a low 
incidence, in both National Toxicology Program bioa ssays (National Toxicology 
Program, 1984, 1993).] 
Follow-up studies were completed to test the hypoth esis that the high incidence of 
lymphocytic lymphomas in mice exposed to concentrat ions of 200 ppm butadiene or 
higher was at least partially dependent on the acti vation of an endogenous retrovirus in 96 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 the strain of mouse used in the study. Groups of 60 male B6C3 F 1 and 60 male NIH Swiss 
mice, 4–6 weeks of age, were exposed to 0 or 1250 p pm [2760 mg/m 3] butadiene 
(> 99.5% pure) by whole-body inhalation for 6 h per  day on 5 days per week for 52 
weeks. An additional group of 50 male B6C3F 1 mice was exposed similarly to butadiene 
for 12 weeks and held until termination of the expe riment at 52 weeks. The incidence of 
thymic lymphomas was 1/60 control, 10/48 exposed fo r 12 weeks and 34/60 exposed for 
52 weeks in B6C3F 1 mice and 8/57 in NIH Swiss mice exposed for 52 wee ks. 
Haemangiosarcomas of the heart were observed in 5/6 0 B6C3F 1 mice and 1/57 NIH 
Swiss mice exposed for 52 weeks. Exposure of B6C3F 1 mice to 1250 ppm of butadiene 
for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for 3–21 weeks g reatly increased the quantity of 
ecotropic retrovirus recovered from bone marrow, th ymus and spleen. This was not the 
case for NIH Swiss mice in which proviral ecotropic  sequences are truncated and the 
virus is not expressed. The authors suggested that the lack of retroviruses provides 
resistance to the induction of the lymphomas by but adiene (Irons et al ., 1987a, 1989; 
Irons, 1990). [The Working Group noted that Swiss m ice are less sensitive to the 
induction of haemangiosarcomas of the heart and lym phomas and that genetic factors 
may contribute to the development of these tumours. ] 
One study addressed the question of whether a singl e, high level of exposure to 
butadiene was sufficient to induce neoplasia. Group s of 60 male and 60 female B6C3F 1 
mice, 8–10 weeks of age, were exposed by whole-body  inhalation for a single 2-h period 
to 0, 1000, 5000 or 10 000 ppm [0, 2200, 11 000 or 22 000 mg/m 3] butadiene [purity 
unspecified]. The mice were then held for 2 years, at which time all survivors were killed 
and tissues and organs were examined histopathologi cally. Survival, weight gains and 
tumour incidence in exposed mice were not affected by exposure to butadiene (survival: 
males — 28/60 control, 34/60 low-dose, 44/60 mid-dos e and 34/60 high-dose; females — 
45/60, 36/60, 38/60 and 48/60, respectively) (Buche r et al ., 1993).  
3.1.2  Rat 
Groups of 100 male and 100 female Sprague-Dawley ra ts, 4–5 weeks of age, were 
exposed by whole-body inhalation to 0, 1000 or 8000  ppm [0, 2200 or 17 600 mg/m 3] 
butadiene (minimal purity, 99.2%) for 6 h per day o n 5 days per week for 111 weeks 
(males) or 105 weeks (females). Survival was reduce d in low- ( p < 0.05) and high-dose 
(p < 0.01) females and in high-dose males ( p < 0.05); the numbers of survivors were: 
males — 45 control, 50 low-dose and 32 high-dose; f emales — 46 control, 32 low-dose 
and 24 high-dose. Tumours that occurred at a signif icantly increased incidence in males 
were pancreatic exocrine adenomas (control, 3/100; low-dose, 1/100; and high-dose, 
10/100, p ≤ 0.001) and interstitial-cell tumours of the testis  (control, 0/100; low-dose, 
3/100; and high-dose, 8/100; p for trend ≤ 0.001). Those that occurred at a significantly 
increased incidence in females were follicular-cell  adenomas of the thyroid gland 
(control, 0/100; low-dose, 2/100; and high-dose, 10 /100; p for trend ≤ 0.01), sarcomas of 
the uterus (control, 1/100; low-dose, 4/100; and hi gh-dose, 5/100; p for trend ≤ 0.05),  1,3-BUTADIENE 99  
 
 carcinomas of the Zymbal gland (control, 0/100; low -dose, 0/100; and high-dose, 4/100; 
p for trend ≤ 0.01) and benign and malignant mammary tumours (co ntrol, 50/100; low-
dose, 79/100; and high-dose, 81/100; p for trend ≤ 0.001). Mammary adenocarcinomas 
were found in 18/100 control, 15/100 low-dose and 2 6/100 high-dose female rats (Owen 
et al ., 1987; Owen & Glaister, 1990). 
3.2 Carcinogenicity of metabolites 
3.2.1  1,2-Epoxy-3-butene (epoxybutene) 
Mouse 
A group of 30 male Swiss mice, 8 weeks of age, rece ived dermal applications of 100 
mg undiluted epoxybutene, the initial monoepoxide m etabolite of butadiene, three times 
per week for life. The median survival time was 237  days; three skin papillomas and one 
squamous-cell carcinoma were observed (Van Duuren et al ., 1963). [The Working Group 
noted that this incidence was similar to that in co ntrol groups that were left untreated.] 
3.2.2  1,2:3,4-Diepoxybutane (diepoxybutane) 
(a) Mouse  
Two groups of 30 male Swiss mice, 8 weeks of age, r eceived dermal applications of 
100 mg D,L-diepoxybutane (10% in acetone) or 100 mg meso -diepoxybutane (10% in 
acetone) three times a week for life. The median su rvival times were 78 and 154 weeks, 
respectively. Two skin papillomas and one squamous- cell carcinoma were observed 
following treatment with D,L-diepoxybutane and six skin papillomas and four squ amous-
cell carcinomas were observed following treatment w ith meso -diepoxybutane. Eight skin 
papillomas and no carcinomas were observed in 120 a cetone-treated controls (Van 
Duuren et al ., 1963). 
D,L-Diepoxybutane induced one skin papilloma or 10 ski n papillomas and six 
squamous-cell carcinomas when applied to the skin o f two groups of 30 female Swiss 
mice, 8 weeks of age, at respective doses of 10 or 3  mg in 100 mg acetone three times per 
week for life. meso -Diepoxybutane induced five skin papillomas and fou r squamous-cell 
carcinomas or one skin papilloma when applied to th e skin of two groups of 30 female 
Swiss mice at respective doses of 10 or 3 mg in 100  mg acetone three times per week for 
life. No tumours were observed in 60 acetone-treate d control mice (Van Duuren et al ., 
1965).  
Groups of 15 male and 15 female strain A mice, 4–6 weeks of age, received 12 thrice 
weekly intraperitoneal injections of L-diepoxybutane at total doses ranging from 1.7 to 
192 mg/kg bw (35–2200 µmol/kg bw) in water or trica prylin. The experiment was 
terminated 39 weeks after the first injection. L-Diepoxybutane slightly increased the 100 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 incidence (40–78% versus 27–37% in controls) and mu ltiplicity (0.5–1.5 tumour/mouse 
versus 0.29–0.48 tumours/mouse in controls) of lung  tumours (Shimkin et al ., 1966). 
Groups of male Swiss mice, 6 weeks of age, received  subcutaneous injections of 0.1 
or 1.1 mg D,L-diepoxybutane in 0.05 mL tricaprylin once a week f or 401–589 days. Five 
local fibrosarcomas and two adenocarcinomas of brea st origin were observed in a group 
of 50 mice (0.1-mg dose) and five local sarcomas in  a group of 30 mice (1.1-mg dose). 
No tumours were observed in three tricaprylin-treat ed control groups (total of 110 
animals) (Van Duuren et al ., 1966). 
Groups of 56 female B6C3F 1 mice [it is unclear whether the animals were 6 or 10–11 
weeks of age] were exposed by inhalation to 0, 2.5 or 5.0 ppm D,L-diepoxybutane for 6 h 
per day on 5 days per week for 6 weeks. Eight anima ls per group were examined for acute 
toxicity at the end of the exposures and most of th e 48 remaining animals in each group 
were held for 18 months to observe tumour development (four a nimals were actually held 
for 6 months and four others for 12 months). The ex posures resulted in nasal lesions that 
led to reduced survival. At the end of the experime nt, neoplastic lesions were observed in 
the nasal mucosa, reproductive organs, lymph nodes,  bone, liver, Harderian gland, 
pancreas and lung, but the only statistically signi ficant increase was in the incidence of 
Harderian gland lesions. The incidence of total Har derian gland tumours was 0/40 
control, 2/42 low-dose and 5/36 high-dose animals ( p < 0.05, χ2 test) (Henderson et al ., 
1999, 2000). 
(b) Rat 
Subcutaneous injection of 1 mg D,L-diepoxybutane in 0.1 mL tricaprylin once a week 
for 550 days induced nine local fibrosarcomas and o ne adenocarcinoma of breast origin in 
50 female Sprague-Dawley rats that were 6 weeks of age at the beginning of the ex-
periment. One adenocarcinoma of breast origin was o bserved in 50 control animals (Van 
Duuren et al ., 1966). 
A 5-mg/mL dose of diepoxybutane dissolved in 0.5 mL  tricaprylin was administered 
once a week by a gastric feeding tube to five femal e Sprague-Dawley rats, 6 weeks of 
age, for 363 days. No gastric tumours were observed  (Van Duuren et al ., 1966). 
Groups of 56 female Sprague-Dawley rats [it is uncl ear whether the animals were 6 or 
10–11 weeks of age] were exposed by inhalation to 0 , 2.5 or 5.0 ppm D,L-diepoxybutane 
for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for 6 weeks. Eig ht animals per group were examined 
for acute toxicity at the end of the exposures and most of the 48 remaining animals in 
each group were held for 18 months to observe tumou r development (four animals were 
actually held for 6 months and four others for 12 mo nths). The exposures resulted in nasal 
lesions that led to reduced survival. At the end of  the experiment, the only significant 
increase was in the incidence of neoplasms of the n asal mucosa. The incidence of these 
tumours, principally squamous-cell carcinomas, was 0/47 control, 12/48 low-dose and 
24/48 high-dose animals. Three high-dose rats had m ultiple tumours (Henderson et al ., 
1999, 2000).  1,3-BUTADIENE 101  
 
 4.     Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
The toxicokinetics and toxicology of butadiene have  been comprehensively reviewed 
(IARC, 1999). No measured data on the pharmacokinet ics of butadiene in exposed 
humans were available at that time. Data on a limit ed number of metabolites and 
haemoglobin adducts of butadiene in exposed humans and data on butadiene and its 
metabolites in experimental systems using human tis sues were included. However, 
considerably more information is currently availabl e regarding the metabolic pathways of 
butadiene and its major metabolites (see Figure 1).

 4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
4.1.1  Humans 
(a) Butadiene 
Perbellini et al . (2003) determined the concentrations of butadiene  in alveolar air, 
blood and urine in humans after non-occupational ex posure. Breath, blood and urine 
samples were taken from 61 men who lived in small mountain v illages of Northeast Italy. 
The mean age of the subjects was 44.5 years (range,  26–64 years); 15 were smokers and 
46 were nonsmokers (11 of these were exposed to sec ondhand tobacco smoke). Samples 
were collected after overnight rest and analysed by  headspace and GC–MS methods. The 
median concentrations of butadiene were 1.2 ng/L (r ange, < 0.8–13.2 ng/L) in alveolar 
air, 2.2 ng/L (range, < 0.5–50.2 ng) in blood and 1 .1 ng/L (range, < 1–8.9 ng/L) in urine. 
Concentrations were significantly higher (two to th ree times) in smokers compared with 
nonsmokers in all biological media. The ratio of th e median butadiene concentration in 
blood to alveolar air was 1.8, which is consistent with published values for measured 
blood:air partition coefficients.  
Lin et al . (2001) conducted an inhalation study to identify influential physiological 
factors in the respiratory uptake of butadiene in h umans. Healthy volunteers (71 men and 
62 women) were exposed to 2 ppm [4.42 mg/m 3] butadiene for 20 min followed by 
purified air for 40 min. Exhaled breath samples wer e collected during exposure to 
determine the uptake of butadiene (micrograms per k ilogram of body weight (bw) 
butadiene absorbed), which varied from 0.6 to 4.9 µg/kg bw. The blood:air partition 
coefficient and alveolar ventilation were most sign ificant in determining uptake. Women 
had a slightly higher uptake than men; increasing a ge and cigarette smoking resulted in 
decreased uptake. The mean percentage of total inha led butadiene that was absorbed was 
45.6% for men and 43.4% for women. 
Lin et al . (2002) developed an automated exposure system to study the toxicokinetics 
of inhaled gases in humans. Butadiene was used for system validation at three levels 
(0.08, 0.4 and 2.0 ppm [0.18, 0.88 and 4.42 mg/m 3]) and the system was tested in three 
subjects who were exposed to 2.0 ppm butadiene for 20 min. Steady-state levels of 
butadiene in alveolar air were obtained before the end of the 20-min exposure. Levels 
ranged between approximately 1 and 1.9 ppm. By the end of the 40-min post-exposure 
period, levels of butadiene in alveolar air had fal len by at least 10-fold. 
Smith et al . (2001) assessed genetic and dietary factors that affect human metabolism 
of butadiene by monitoring exhaled breath during and afte r a 20-min exposure of 71 male 
and 62 female volunteers to 2 ppm [4.42 mg/m 3] butadiene. Chlorzoxazone was admin-
istered following exposure and urine was collected to measure the cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 2E1 phenotype. A physiologically based pharma cokinetic model was fit to the 
exhaled breath measurements of each volunteer to es timate model parameters, including 
metabolic rate. No correlation was found between to tal butadiene uptake and any of the 
parameters (metabolic rate, oxidation rate and CYP2 E1 phenotype or genotype).  1,3-BUTADIENE 103  
 
 Gordon et al . (2002) used real-time breath measurement methods to investigate the 
suitability of volatile organic compounds, includin g butadiene, as breath biomarkers for 
active and passive smoking. Five adult smoker/nonsm oker pairs were recruited into the 
study. During cigarette smoking, smokers exhaled in to the breath analyser throughout a 
2–2.5-h smoking period. After smoking, the long-ter m decay in the breath of the smokers 
was recorded continuously for 15 min. Exhaled breat h in nonsmokers, who were in the 
room with the smokers, was also monitored. The maxi mum breath concentration of 
butadiene was relatively constant among smokers and  averaged 373 µg/m 3 [169 ppm]. 
Following cessation of smoking, the mean residence time was 0.47 min. The average 
room air concentration of butadiene was 18.9 µg/m 3 [42 ppm]. Many of the post-exposure 
measurements of the breath of nonsmokers were below  the limit of quantitation. The 
average increase in breath concentration of butadie ne in nonsmokers and smokers, 
respectively, was 14.4 and 353 µg/m 3 [6.5 and 160 ppm]. 
(b) Metabolites 
Several investigators have quantified the presence of metabolites derived from 
butadiene in the urine of humans in controlled labo ratory, environmental or workplace 
settings. A scheme that describes metabolic pathway s of butadiene deduced from in-vitro 
and in-vivo findings in mammals is presented in Fig ure 1. Two urinary metabolites have 
been identified: 1,2-dihydroxybutyl mercapturic aci d (DHBMA; also referred to as DHB, 
MI, M-I or M1) and monohydroxy-3-butenyl mercapturi c acid (MHBMA; also referred 
to as MII, M-II or M2). Both metabolites are mercap turic acids and are derived from the 
glutathione (GSH) conjugates of electrophilic butadiene metabolites (Figure 1). MHBMA 
results from the enzyme-mediated reaction of 1,2-ep oxy-3-butene (epoxybutene) with 
GSH. Two isomeric forms of MHBMA have been quantifi ed in the urine of rats and mice 
(Elfarra et al. , 1995). It should be noted, however, that some of the early studies may have 
not quantified both of these isomers. DHBMA results from the hydrolysis of epoxybutene 
by epoxide hydrolase (EH) followed by further enzym atic reaction by CYP or alcohol 
dehydrogenase (ADH) to yield hydroxymethylvinyl ket one (HMVK) before eventual 
conjugation with GSH (Sprague & Elfarra, 2004). The  relative proportions of these 
metabolites that were measured depended on the spec ies. Due to the higher concentrations 
of DHBMA in control subjects, DHBMA appears to be a  less specific biomarker for ex-
posure than MHBMA, for which background levels are relatively low. However, both 
metabolites appear to be elevated in humans exposed  to butadiene compared with un-
exposed controls. 
Sapkota et al . (2006) collected personal air and urine samples f rom individuals in 
traffic-dense environments in order to characterize  exposure to butadiene in this setting. 
Urine samples were analysed for MHBMA and DHBMA. Exposure t o butadiene differed 
among the groups; median values were 2.38, 1.62 and 0. 88 µg/m 3 [5, 3.6 and 1.9 ppm] for 
toll collectors (nine individuals), urban–weekday ( seven individuals) and suburban–
weekend (seven individuals) groups, respectively. T hese groups represented high, 104 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 medium and low levels of exposure intensity. All in dividuals were nonsmokers in non-
smoking households. For the three groups, mean leve ls of MHBMA were 9.7, 6.0 and 
6.8 ng/mL and those of DHBMA were 378, 258, and 306  ng/mL, respectively.  
Urban et al . (2003) applied a tandem liquid chromatography (LC )–MS method to 
determine levels of MHBMA and DHBMA in the urine of  humans. Exposure to tobacco 
smoke had a significant effect on the urinary excre tion of MHBMA and the metabolite 
ratio DHBMA/(DHBMA + MHBMA). Urine samples were col lected over a 24-h period 
from 10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers. Mean MHBMA level s were 12.5 and 86.4 µg/24 h 
for nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. Mean DHBM A levels were 459 and 
644 µg/24 h for nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. Th e metabolic ratio was 0.970 
and 0.859 for the two groups, respectively. 
Fustinoni et al . (2004) assessed exposure to butadiene in two groups who w orked in a 
butadiene plant: 42 occupationally exposed workers and 43 unexposed controls. Personal 
exposure to butadiene was assessed by collecting ai r samples during the 8-h workshift 
(three to four times over a period of 6 weeks for t he exposed and once for the control 
group). Urine and exhaled air samples were collecte d at the beginning and end of the 
workshift and blood samples were taken at the end o f the workshift for the exposed; all 
samples were collected at the end of the workshift for the controls. Concentrations of 
DHBMA and MHBMA were determined in the urine sample s. Mean airborne butadiene 
concentrations were 11.5 and 0.9 µg/m 3 [5.2 and 0.4 ppm] for exposed and control 
groups, respectively. Mean concentrations of butadi ene metabolites in blood and urine 
were higher in exposed workers: 8.3 ng/L and 5.9 ng /L in blood and 4.3 ng/L and 
3.1 ng/L in urine of exposed and control groups bef ore the workshift, respectively. Con-
centrations of butadiene metabolites in urine at th e end of the workshift were 605 µg/L 
and 602 µg/L DHBMA and 10.5 µg/L and 7.5 µg/L MHBMA in exposed and controls, 
respectively. 
(c) Haemoglobin adducts 
While haemoglobin adducts are not causally related to mutagenic events, they provide 
an effective measure of exposure to reactive interm ediates of chemicals. Haemoglobin 
adducts accumulate during the life of red cells whi ch is approximately 120 days in 
humans. The butadiene metabolite, epoxybutene, has been shown to react with haemo-
globin to form N-(2-hydroxy-3-butenyl)valine (MHbVal) adducts. Anot her haemoglobin 
adduct of butadiene is N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)valine (THbVal), which can be fo rmed in 
humans by the reaction of 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (epoxybutanediol) with haemoglobin 
or by the reaction of 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (diepox ybutane) with haemoglobin followed 
by hydrolysis of the haemoglobin adduct (Swenberg et al. , 2000a). Swenberg et al . (2001) 
reviewed data on various biomarkers for butadiene an d noted that those on both DNA and 
haemoglobin adducts strongly support the conclusion  that epoxybutanediol is the major 
electrophile that binds to these macromolecules.  
Boogaard (2002) reviewed the use of haemoglobin add ucts to monitor exposure and 
drew several important conclusions. In theory, the removal of haemoglobin adducts is a  1,3-BUTADIENE 105  
 
 zero-order process and is only determined by the li fe-span of the erythrocyte. Poor 
correlations were found between concentrations of a dducts in a spot blood sample and air 
concentrations on a limited number of days (i.e. 1– 3 days during the shift). In contrast, 
good correlations were found when very frequent air  monitoring was carried out, such as 
10 full-day shift measurements over a 2-month period. Goo d correlations were also found 
between an increase in adduct concentration over a short period of time and the cumu-
lative exposure during this time, which was determi ned by continuous monitoring. The 
author noted that, when specific adducts are determ ined, information is also obtained 
regarding the chemical nature of the reactive inter mediates. Butadiene forms at least two 
other reactive intermediates other than epoxybutene:  diepoxybutane and epoxybutanediol, 
both of which form the same THbVal adducts. One of the major data gaps in the assess-
ment of exposure to butadiene is a sensitive biomar ker that is specific for diepoxybutane. 
One potential biomarker is the cyclic adduct, N,N-(2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-butadiyl)valine 
(PyrVal), which has recently been quantified in rat s and mice exposed to levels as low as 
1 ppm [2.21 mg/m 3] butadiene for 10 days, but its presence has yet t o be quantified in 
human haemoglobin samples (Boysen et al. , 2004; Swenberg et al. , 2007). 
The utility of haemoglobin adducts as biomarkers fo r human exposure to butadiene 
has been investigated in several molecular epidemio logical studies that often included the 
measurement of urinary metabolites and personal air  monitoring of butadiene, as well as 
genotoxicity end-points and metabolic phenotypes. 
Van Sittert et al . (2000) and Boogaard et al . (2001a) reported on the assessment of 
urinary metabolites and haemoglobin adducts. One st udy involved 44 male workers in a 
butadiene monomer production facility in the Nether lands who were exposed to low 
levels of butadiene and 28 male administrative work ers with no occupational exposure to 
butadiene. A second study conducted in a butadiene monomer and styrene–butadiene 
rubber production facility in Prague, Czech Republi c, involved 24 male workers from the 
monomer unit, 34 from the polymer unit and 25 admin istrative workers. This study is 
described in detail by Albertini et al . (2001, 2003a). In the two studies, airborne level s of 
butadiene, MHBMA, DHBMA and MHbVal were determined.  MHBMA was more sen-
sitive than DHBMA for monitoring recent exposures a nd could be detected at an 8-h 
TWA exposure as low as 0.13 ppm [0.29 mg/m 3]. The sensitivity of DHBMA was 
restricted by high background levels, of which the origin is unknown. This study 
confirmed the higher hydrolytic activity in humans compared with rodents, as shown in 
other studies, which was reflected in the much high er ratio of DHBMA/(MHBMA + 
DHBMA). 
In the study in the Netherlands, airborne levels of  butadiene ranged from 0.2 to 
9.5 ppm [0.09–4.3 mg/m 3] (8-h TWA) and levels of MHbVal ranged from 0.6 to  
3.8 pmol/g haemoglobin in exposed workers and from 0.1 to 1.2 pmol/g haemoglobin in 
controls. In the study in Prague, airborne levels o f butadiene ranged from 0 to 0.038 ppm 
[0–0.02 mg/m 3] for the controls, 0.02 to 1.6 ppm [0.009–0.72 mg/ m 3] for the monomer 
workers and 0.02 to 4.2 ppm [0.009–1.9 mg/m 3] for the polymer workers. There was a 
strong correlation between the 60-day average airbo rne concentration of butadiene and 106 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 MHbVal, which the authors concluded was a sensitive metho d for monitoring cumulative 
exposures to butadiene above 0.35 ppm [0.16 mg/m 3]. In controls, urinary levels of 
MHBMA ranged from 0.1 to 7.3 µg/L and those of DHBM A from 197 to 747 µg/L. In 
the monomer and polymer workers, levels of MHBMA ranged from  < 0.1 to 44 µg/L and 
from 1.7 to 962 µg/L, respectively, in end-of-shift urine samples. L evels of DHBMA 
ranged from 52 to 3522 µg/L in the monomer and from  190 to 26 207 µg/L in the 
polymer workers. For each metabolite there was a st rong correlation between the urinary 
concentration and 8-h TWA levels of airborne butadi ene. 
Albertini et al . (2001, 2003a) conducted a molecular epidemiologic al study of 
humans exposed to butadiene in an occupational sett ing in Prague, Czech Republic (24 
butadiene monomer production workers, 34 polymeriza tion workers and 25 controls). 
Personal 8-h TWA measurements of exposure to butadi ene were made on several 
occasions over a 60-day period, and biological samp les were obtained for the measure-
ment of biomarkers of butadiene metabolism: urinary meta bolites of butadiene, MHBMA 
and DHBMA and the haemoglobin adducts, MHbVal and T HbVal. Mean 8-h TWA 
levels of exposure to butadiene were 0.642 mg/m 3 [1.42 ppm] for the monomer workers, 
1.794 mg/m 3 [3.96 ppm] for the polymerization workers and 0.023  mg/m 3 [0.05 ppm] for 
the controls. All four biomarkers were significantl y correlated with levels of exposure to 
butadiene; the haemoglobin adducts were the most hi ghly correlated. After a workshift, 
mean concentrations of DHBMA were 764, 4647 and 353  µg/L for the monomer pro-
duction, polymerization and administration workers,  respectively, and mean concen-
trations of MHBMA were 9.44, 120.17 and 1.70 µg/L, respectively. The proportion of 
MHBMA to the total urinary metabolites (MHBMA + DHBM A) was analysed relative to 
the glutathione- S-transferase (GST) genotypes, GSTM1  and GSTT1 , for all three exposure 
groups. The mean ratios for workers with the homozy gous null genotypes in all groups 
were always lower than those for workers with posit ive genotypes. Thus, although 
MHBMA represents a minor pathway in butadiene metab olism, there is a decrease in the 
proportion of this metabolite formed by GST-null ind ividuals. Concentrations of MHbVal 
were 0.47, 2.23 and 0.22 pmol/g haemoglobin for the  monomer production, polymer-
ization and administration workers, respectively. T he group means were correlated with 
the measured mean levels of exposure to butadiene. Mean concentrations of the THbVal 
adduct were 178.73, 716.70 and 94.77 pmol/g haemogl obin for the three groups, 
respectively. Thus, the THbVal adduct is present at  concentrations that are increased 
approximately fivefold over background. There was n o effect of GSTT1  or GSTM1  
genotype on the formation of haemoglobin adducts. 
Albertini et al . (2007) reported a second study in Czech workers t hat included both 
men and women: 23 female workers exposed to butadiene, 26 f emale control workers, 30 
male workers exposed to butadiene and 25 male contr ol workers. Multiple external 
exposure measurements were made over a 4-month peri od before biological samples 
were collected. Mean 8-h TWA exposure levels were 0 .008 mg/m 3 [0.0035 ppm] and 
0.397 mg/m 3 [0.180 ppm] for female controls and exposed worker s, respectively. 
Exposure levels for men were 0.007 mg/m 3 [0.0032 ppm] and 0.808 mg/m 3 [0.370 ppm]  1,3-BUTADIENE 107  
 
 for controls and exposed, respectively. Urinary concentra tions of MHBMA and DHBMA 
were elevated in exposed male and female workers co mpared with controls. Mean levels 
of DHBMA were 331.6 µg/L and 508.1 µg /L for control and exposed women, 
respectively, and 512.8 µg/L and 854.1 µg/L for control and exposed men, respectively. 
Mean levels of MHBMA were 8.3 µg/L and 19.2 µg /L for control and exposed women, 
respectively, and 14.9 µg/L and 47.9 µg/L for control and exposed men, respectively. As 
part of this study, assays were conducted to determ ine the presence of the haemoglobin 
adduct, PyrVal. This adduct is specific for the hig hly genotoxic metabolite of butadiene, 
diepoxybutane. All samples were below the limit of quantit ation for the assay (0.3 pmol/g 
haemoglobin). 
Swenberg et al . (2007) quantified PyrVal in the blood of mice and  rats exposed to 
1 ppm [2.21 mg/m 3] butadiene. For these comparative studies, 50 mg h aemoglobin from 
workers, rats and mice were analysed by the method of Boysen et al . (2007). Whereas all 
rat and mouse samples had quantifiable amounts of P yrVal, none of the human samples 
did. The authors reported that, although the TWA ex posures to butadiene in the Czech 
study were below 1 ppm [2.21 mg/m 3] for both men and women, the duration of exposure 
was much greater for humans than for rodents, which  made the cumulative exposures 
comparable. Since haemoglobin adducts form over the  lifespan of the erythrocyte 
(humans, 120 days; rats, 63 days; and mice, 43 days ), human haemoglobin had a 
cumulative exposure similar to that of both rats an d mice (women: 0.18 ppm butadiene × 
17.1 weeks = 3.1 ppm–weeks; men: 0.37 ppm butadiene × 17.1 weeks = 6.3 ppm–weeks; 
rodents: 1 ppm butadiene × 4 weeks = 4.0 ppm–weeks) . They also reported that the 
analytical peaks in samples from rats exposed to 1 ppm [2.21 mg/m 3] butadiene were 
sufficiently large that quantitative measurements c ould have been made with one-third of 
the haemoglobin, which suggests that humans form at  least three times less PyrVal than 
similarly exposed rats and 100 times less than simi larly exposed mice. 
Fustinoni et al . (2002) investigated the role of genetic polymorph isms in the 
metabolism of butadiene in 40 Italian subjects. Thi rty were occupationally exposed 
during butadiene monomer production or polymerizati on processes and 10 were 
unexposed administrative clerks. Air samples were c ollected from butadiene-exposed 
workers during the workshift using personal sampler s. Personal exposure to airborne 
butadiene ranged from 4 to 201 µg/m 3 [1.8–90.5 ppm]. At the end of the workshift, blood 
and urine samples were collected from all subjects.  Concentrations of the urinary 
metabolite DHBMA and the haemoglobin adduct THbVal were ass essed. Median urinary 
DHBMA concentrations were 17.1 mg/g creatinine in e xposed workers and 1.42 mg/g 
creatinine in unexposed workers; THBVal levels were  37 pmol/g haemoglobin and 35.3 
pmol/g haemoglobin in exposed and unexposed groups, respectively. Smoking influenced 
the formation of haemoglobin adducts and higher THb Val levels were found in subjects 
with GSTM1  null and GSTT1  null genotypes. 
Hayes et al . (2001) examined a spectrum of outcomes in 41 buta diene polymer 
production workers and 38 controls in China. Smoker s accounted for 86.7% of the 
exposed group and 78.6% of the controls. Median but adiene concentrations (6-h TWA) 108 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 were 2 ppm [0.90 mg/m 3] for the exposed group and 0 ppm for the controls,  as 
determined during a 6-h workshift using personal sa mplers. A post-shift blood sample and 
during-shift urine samples were also collected. Med ian urinary concentrations of 
DHBMA were 1.3 µg/mg creatinine in the exposed group and 0.6 µg/mg creatinine in the 
controls. THbVal haemoglobin adducts were significa ntly more common [numerical data 
not provided] in exposed workers than in the unexpo sed ( p < 0.0001) and correlated well 
with air measurement (Spearman’s ρ = 0.40, p = 0.03) and weakly with urinary butadiene 
(Spearman’s ρ = 0.37, p = 0.24).  
(d) Physiologically based toxicokinetic models 
Physiologically based models founded on informative  prior distributions for 
population parameters as well as previously publish ed data on exhaled breath 
concentrations of butadiene in exposed humans have been designed to facilitate a global 
sensitivity analysis of the kinetics of butadiene a nd its metabolites in humans; the most 
recent was published by Brochot et al.  (2007) and its purpose was to guide the design of 
new human experiments intended to collect critically usefu l kinetic data on butadiene and 
its metabolites.  
4.1.2  Experimental systems  
At the beginning of each of the following sections,  brief highlights on the disposition 
of butadiene that were summarized previously (IARC,  1999) are presented. The reader 
should refer to that monograph for citations and mo re complete descriptions of the 
relevant studies. These highlights are followed by information that has been published 
since that time. For this and other sections, diepo xybutane refers to the ( ±) racemic 
mixture of diastereomers, unless otherwise specifie d.  
(a) Butadiene 
Inhalation pharmacokinetic studies conducted in Spr ague-Dawley rats and B6C3F 1 
mice demonstrated linear metabolic elimination kine tics at exposures of up to about 
1000 ppm [2200 mg/m 3]; maximal rates of butadiene metabolism were highe r in mice 
(400 µmol/h/kg) than in rats (220 µmol/h/kg) (IARC, 1999). In the linear range, metab-
olism is limited by the uptake of this gas. At equi valent, non-saturating exposure levels, 
steady-state blood concentrations of butadiene are about twofold higher in mice than in 
rats. Numerous metabolites have been identified in the urine of rats and mice exposed to 
butadiene (Figure 1); the major urinary metabolites  are mercapturic acids (DHBMA and 
MHBMA) that result from conjugation of epoxybutene or HMVK, a metabolite of 
butenediol, with GSH.  
Exhaled epoxybutene was measured in chamber atmosph eres in which male B6C3F 1 
mice or Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for up to 8 h to constant concentrations of 
butadiene that ranged from 1 ppm to 6000 ppm [2.21– 13 260 mg/m 3] (mice) or 
10 000 ppm [22 100 mg/m 3] (rats) (Filser et al ., 2007). In additional experiments, blood  1,3-BUTADIENE 109  
 
 levels of diepoxybutane, butenediol and epoxybutane diol were measured at the end of 6-h 
exposures that ranged from 60 ppm [132.6 mg/m 3] up to about 1200 ppm [2652 mg/m 3]. 
Epoxybutanediol is formed by partial hydrolysis of diepoxybutane or by oxidation of 
butenediol (Figure 1). Blood concentrations of epox ybutene were estimated from the 
product of its atmospheric concentration at steady state and its blood:air partition 
coefficient. Mouse:rat ratios of blood concentratio ns of epoxybutene were 2.0–2.6 at 
concentrations of butadiene below 10 ppm [22.1 mg/m3], 3.8 at 100 ppm [221 mg/m 3], 
4.9 at 625 ppm [1381 mg/m 3] and 8.0 at 1250 ppm [2762.5 mg/m 3]. Blood concentrations 
of diepoxybutane in mice were 0.30, 2.2 and 3.2 µmol/L at 67, 630 and 1270 ppm [148, 
1392.3 and 2806.7 mg/m 3] butadiene, respectively. Diepoxybutane was not de tected in 
the blood of rats exposed to up to 900 ppm [1989 mg /m 3] butadiene (detection limit, 
10 nmol/L) (Filser et al. , 2007). However, previous studies (IARC, 1999) rep orted 
diepoxybutane levels of 2.4–5 nmol/L in male and 11  nmol/L in female Sprague-Dawley 
rats exposed to 62.5 ppm [138 mg/m 3] butadiene. Butenediol levels reached 60 µmol/L in 
both species exposed to 1200 ppm [2652 mg/m 3] butadiene, whereas maximum blood 
levels of epoxybutanediol were 42 µmol/L in mice exposed to 300 ppm [663 mg/m 3] 
butadiene and 9.5 µmol/L in rats exposed to 150 ppm [331.5 mg/m 3] butadiene. The 
limited epoxybutanediol formation was suggested to be due to competition by butadiene 
for the CYP-mediated oxidation of epoxybutene to di epoxybutane and of butenediol to 
epoxybutanediol. In rats, the total blood concentra tions of epoxybutene and 
epoxybutanediol were greater after exposure to 200 ppm [442 mg/m 3] butadiene than 
after exposure to 1000 or 8000 ppm [2210 or 17 680 mg/m 3]; the latter values are the 
concentrations of butadiene that were used in a rat  carcinogenicity study. 
First-pass metabolism of butadiene to epoxybutene, diepoxybutane, butenediol, 
epoxybutanediol and crotonaldehyde was quantified i n the livers of male Sprague-Dawley 
rats and B6C3F 1 mice perfused in a gas-tight all-glass system (Fil ser et al ., 2001). 
Concentrations of butadiene in the perfusate and pe rfusion rates were 330 nmol/mL at 3–
4 mL/min for mouse liver and 240 nmol/mL at 17–20 m L/min for rat liver. 
Concentrations of butadiene and its metabolites in the perfusate that entered and left the 
liver were measured during 100-min perfusions. The perfusate consisted of Krebs-
Henseleit buffer that contained bovine erythrocytes, bovi ne serum albumin and a constant 
concentration of butadiene. The rate of single-pass  butadiene metabolism was estimated 
to be 0.014 and 0.055 mmol/h per liver of mouse and  rat, respectively. The mean 
concentration of epoxybutene was 1.1 nmol/mL in the  rat liver effluent and 9.4 nmol/mL 
in the mouse liver effluent. Butenediol concentrati ons in the perfusates that left the liver 
were similar in rats and mice (approximately 7 and 8 nmol/mL, respectively). Levels of 
diepoxybutane and epoxybutanediol were below the li mit of detection in the effluent from 
the rat liver and low in the mouse liver effluent ( approximately 0.06 and 0.07 nmol/mL, 
respectively). Concentrations of crotonaldehyde wer e below the limit of detection 
(60 nmol/L) in both rat and mouse liver.  
Filser et al . (2001) also studied butadiene metabolism in perfu sed livers obtained 
from rats that were depleted of GSH by pretreatment  with diethylmaleate. Under these 110 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 conditions, the rate of metabolism was not altered;  however, concentrations of 
epoxybutene and butenediol were increased 25- and 1 0-fold, respectively, and 
concentrations of diepoxybutane and crotonaldehyde in the effluent perfusates were 
quantifiable (0.15 and 0.10 nmol/mL, respectively).  The authors concluded that GST 
activity is important in controlling the production  of diepoxybutane and crotonaldehyde in 
rats.  
(b) Metabolites  in vitro  (see Figure 1)  
Butadiene is oxidized initially to epoxybutene by n icotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH)-dependent metabolism that primari ly involves CYP2E1 and 
CYP2A6. This metabolic pathway has been measured in  microsomal fractions obtained 
from the livers and lungs of mice, rats and humans and from the kidney and testis of rats 
and mice (IARC, 1999). At low concentrations of but adiene, metabolism via CYP2E1 
predominates. Liver microsomes from mice, rats and humans can also oxidize 
epoxybutene to diepoxybutane. Kinetic parameters (m aximum velocity [V max ] and 
Michaelis-Menten constant [K m]) indicated faster rates of oxidative metabolism o f 
butadiene and epoxybutene in microsomes from mice t han in those from rats, while 
human liver microsomes showed a wide range of activ ites (Csanady et al ., 1992; 
Duescher & Elfarra, 1994), but only a small number of human liver and lung samples 
were analysed. Mouse, rat and human microsomes can convert epoxybutene to both 
(±)-diepoxybutane and meso -diepoxybutane. The latter isomer is preferentially  
hydrolysed in rat and human liver microsomes (Kraus e & Elfarra, 1997). Epoxybutene 
and diepoxybutane are eliminated by microsomal EH ( mEH) and by cytosolic GST 
activities. In-vitro kinetics of EH- and GST-cataly sed metabolism of epoxybutene and 
diepoxybutane in microsomal and cytosolic fractions  from livers and lungs of mice, rats 
and humans have also been reported (IARC, 1999). GST activ ities were highest in mouse 
and lowest in human cytosol; EH activities were hig hest in human and lowest in mouse 
microsomes. Bone-marrow cells of mice and humans ca n also oxidize butadiene to 
epoxybutene by a myeloperoxidase-catalysed reaction . A third epoxide intermediate of 
butadiene metabolism, epoxybutanediol, can be forme d by the oxidation of butenediol 
(the product of epoxybutene hydrolysis) or by parti al hydrolysis of diepoxybutane.  
Hepatocytes isolated from male B6C3F 1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats were 
incubated with epoxybutene and evaluated for the for mation of diepoxybutane, butenediol 
and GSH conjugates at 5-min intervals during incubat ions of up to 45 min (Kemper et al ., 
2001). The results are shown in Table 22. Cumulativ e levels of combined racemic and 
meso -diepoxybutane (oxidation of epoxybutene) were high er in mouse than in rat 
hepatocyte cultures, whereas the cumulative levels of butenediol (hydrolysis of 
epoxybutene) were higher in the rat hepatocyte cult ures. GSH conjugates were present at 
similar levels in both rat and mouse hepatocyte cul tures. 
Hepatic microsomes pooled from cynomolgus monkeys o r humans exposed to 
butadiene (monkey microsomes: 46 ppm, 290 ppm or 28  000 ppm [102, 641 or 
61 880 mg/m 3]; human microsomes: 45 ppm, 450 ppm or 36 000 ppm [99, 995 or  1,3-BUTADIENE 111  
 
 79 560 mg/m 3]) produced epoxybutene at similar rates (Dahl & He nderson, 2000). 
Oxidation of epoxybutene to diepoxybutane, which is  competitively inhibited by 
butadiene, was slightly faster in monkey than in hu man microsomes.

(c) Metabolites  in vivo (see Figure 1)  
The identification of epoxybutene in exhaled breath , blood and multiple organs of rats 
or mice exposed to butadiene indicates the systemic  availability of this metabolic 
intermediate. At equivalent exposure concentrations  of butadiene, tissue levels of 
epoxybutene and diepoxybutane were higher in mice t han in rats (IARC, 1999).  
14 C-Labelled epoxybutene was administered as a single  intraperitoneal injection to 
male Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F 1 mice at doses of 1, 5, 20 and 50 mg/kg bw; urine 
and faeces were collected up to 48 h after treatmen t (Richardson et al ., 1998). 
Approximately 50% of the administered radioactivity was ex creted in the urine and 2–5% 
in the faeces. Urinary metabolites identified in th is study are listed in Table 23. Because 
the percentage of urinary radioactivity recovered f or each metabolite did not differ in 
relation to the administered dose, mean values acro ss the dose groups are shown. Both 
species preferentially metabolized epoxybutene by d irect conjugation with GSH. In rats, 
48–64% of the urinary radioactivity was derived fro m the direct reaction of epoxybutene 
with GSH and 14–25% was derived from hydrolysis of epo xybutene. In mice, 60–72% of 
the urinary radioactivity was derived from the dire ct reaction of epoxybutene with GSH 
and 6–10% was derived from hydrolysis of epoxybuten e. No metabolites of 
diepoxybutane were detected in the urine of either species.  112 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

b Individual metabolites in the polar fraction were l ess than 1% of the recovered urinary radioactivity.  
Male Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F 1 mice were exposed by nose-only inhalation 
to 200 ppm [442 mg/m 3] [2,3-14 C]butadiene for 6 h; radioactivity in urine, faeces , exhaled 
volatiles and [ 14 C]carbon dioxide was measured during and up to 42 h  after exposure 
(Richardson et al ., 1999). Total uptake of butadiene was 0.19 mmol/k g bw (10.3 mg/kg) 
in rats and 0.38 mmol/kg bw (20.5 mg/kg) in mice. I n rats, 40% of the recovered 
radioactivity was exhaled as [ 14 C]carbon dioxide, 42% was excreted in urine, 8% was  
excreted in faeces and 9% remained in the carcass. In mice, 6% of the recovered 
radioactivity was exhaled as [ 14 C]carbon dioxide, 71% was excreted in urine, 11% wa s 
excreted in faeces and 13% remained in the carcass.  Because the position of the radiolabel 
in this study was on carbons 2 and 3, the formation  of [ 14 C]carbon dioxide is a result of 
the loss of two carbon atoms from butadiene. Urinar y metabolites identified in this study 
are listed in Table 24. Metabolites arising from th e direct reaction of epoxybutene with 
GSH accounted for 8% of the metabolized dose in rat s and 16% of the metabolized dose 
in mice. In contrast to the study of epoxybutene metabolis m (Richardson et al ., 1998), the 
study on butadiene metabolism identified trihydroxy butyl mercapturic acids in the urine 
of exposed rats and mice.   1,3-BUTADIENE 113

a Italicized metabolites are produced subsequent to h ydrolysis of epoxybutene; the other 
metabolites listed are produced by direct reaction of epoxybutene with glutathione. 
Urinary metabolites were also identified in male Sp rague-Dawley rats and B6C3F 1 
mice exposed by nose-only inhalation to 1, 5 or 20 ppm [2.21, 11 or 44 mg/m 3] 
[2,3-14 C]butadiene for 6 h (Booth et al ., 2004a). This study did not include measurements 
of radioactivity in faeces, exhaled volatiles, carb on dioxide or the carcass. Urine was 
collected over an 18-h period after exposure but no t during exposure. The profiles of 
urinary metabolites were somewhat similar to those reported by Richardson et al . (1999). 
Four mercapturic acids derived from HMVK were ident ified in the urine from male 
B6C3F 1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats given a single intrap eritoneal injection of 25, 
62.5, 125 or 200 mg/kg bw butanediol (Sprague & Elf arra, 2004). The metabolites were 
N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl conjugates of 1,2-dihydroxybutane, 1-hydroxy-2- butanone, 
propanol and propionic acid. HMVK may be formed by ADH- or CYP-mediated 
oxidation of butenediol. These four HMVK-derived metabol ites accounted for 7 and 11% 
of the total radioactivity recovered from rats and mice exposed to butadiene, respectively 
(Richardson et al ., 1999).  114 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 Trace amounts of 1-hydroxy-2-butanone, crotonic aci d, propionic acid and 2-
ketobutyric acid were detected in the urine of male  B6C3F 1 mice and Sprague-Dawley 
rats administered butanediol by intraperitoneal inj ection (mice: 125 or 250 mg/kg bw; 
rats: 62.5, 125, 200 or 250 mg/kg bw) (Sprague & El farra, 2003). The combined 
concentration of these metabolites was less than 1%  of the administered dose of 
butenediol; these low levels may be due to further metabolism of the carboxylic acids 
prior to their excretion in the urine. The detectio n of these metabolites suggests the 
possibility that toxic intermediary metabolites, su ch as crotonaldehyde, may be formed 
from butenediol.  
(d) Haemoglobin adducts 
Epoxybutene can form two diastomeric pairs of adduc ts at the N-terminal valine of 
haemoglobin termed MHbVal: N-(2-hydroxy-3-buten-1-yl)valine and N-(1-hydroxy-3-
buten-2-yl)valine (IARC, 1999). Levels of these add ucts formed in rats and mice are 
dependent on exposure concentrations of butadiene, duration of exposure and the turnover 
rates of red blood cells.  
Much work has been carried out on the use of haemog lobin adducts as biomarkers of 
internal levels of the epoxide intermediates of but adiene metabolism. Epoxybutene, 
diepoxybutane and epoxybutanediol can react with th e N-terminal valine to form 
MHbVal, PyrVal and THbVal adducts, respectively (Bo ysen et al ., 2007). In addition, 
THbVal may also be formed by the reaction of haemog lobin with diepoxybutane and 
subsequent hydrolysis of the remaining epoxide grou p. 
THbVal adduct levels in haemoglobin isolated from e rythrocytes of male Sprague-
Dawley rats and B6C3F 1 mice exposed by nose-only inhalation to 1, 5 or 20 ppm [2.2, 1 1 
or 44 mg/m 3] [2,3-14 C]butadiene for 6 h per day for 5 days were 80, 179  and 512 pmol/g 
haemoglobin for rats, respectively, and 143, 351 an d 1100 pmol/g haemoglobin for mice, 
respectively (Booth et al ., 2004a). However, the level of radioactivity was approximately 
1.3-fold higher in rat than in mouse haemoglobin. The meas ured levels of THbVal adduct 
represented only about 1–2% of the total radioactiv e adducts in the haemoglobin, which 
indicates that multiple alkylation sites within hae moglobin may be modified by butadiene 
metabolites. After incubation of epoxybutane with e rythrocytes, Moll et al. (2000) 
detected 10 epoxybutane adducts on each of the α- and β-globin chains.  
A specific ring-closed adduct, the pyrolidine adduc t PyrVal, can be formed by the 
reaction of haemoglobin with diepoxybutane (Fred et al ., 2004). This adduct has been 
measured after in-vitro reactions of rat and mouse erythrocyte haemolysates with 
diepoxybutane and after intraperitoneal injections of diepoxybutane into Fischer 344 rats 
and C57/BL mice. The levels of PyrVal adduct per ad ministered dose were similar in rat 
and mouse haemoglobin after in-vitro or in-vivo exp osure to diepoxybutane. In addition, 
THbVal adducts were measured in rats and mice given  intraperitoneal injections of 
diepoxybutane or epoxybutanediol. Levels of this ad duct were similar in mice and rats 
dosed with epoxybutanediol; however, after treatmen t with diepoxybutane, levels of 
THbVal adducts were three to four times higher in r ats.   1,3-BUTADIENE 115  
 
 Several haemoglobin adducts were measured in rats a nd mice after inhalation 
exposure to butadiene (Boysen et al ., 2004, 2007). Female B6C3F 1 mice were exposed to 
3, 62.5 or 1250 ppm [6.6, 138 or 3453 mg/m 3] butadiene for 6 h per day for 2 weeks, 
while female Fischer 344 rats were exposed to 3 or 62.5 ppm [6.6 or 138 mg/m 3] for 
10 days. At equivalent butadiene exposures, the lev els of MHbVal and PyrVal were 
higher in mice than in rats, while levels of THbVal  were similar in these species 
(Table 25). The formation of each of these adducts in mice and rats was more efficient 
(pmol adduct/g haemoglobin per ppm butadiene) at 3 ppm butadiene than at higher 
exposure concentrations. The major adduct formed in  mice and rats is THbVal. In rats, 
formation of THbVal reaches a plateau at exposures to butadiene above 62.5 ppm 
(Boysen et al ., 2007).

The levels of THbVal adducts in female B6C3F 1 mice exposed by inhalation to 6, 18 
or 36 ppm butanediol for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for 4 weeks  were approximately 
twofold higher than those in female Fischer 344 rat s exposed to the same concentrations 
of this metabolite. The similarity in the shape of the dose–response curves for the 
formation of these adducts and the induction of hyp oxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase gene ( Hprt ) mutant frequency in splenic T cells from mice and rats exp osed to 
butenediol suggests that epoxybutanediol (the produ ct of butenediol epoxidation) may 
play a significant role in the mutagenicity of buta diene (Powley et al ., 2005).  
(e) Physiological toxicokinetic models of butadiene disposition 
Several physiologically based toxicokinetic models have been developed to 
characterize the disposition of butadiene and epoxybuten e in rats and mice (IARC, 1999). 116 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 These models were based on species-specific physiolo gical parameters, in-vitro metabolic 
parameters, and blood:air, tissue:air and tissue:bl ood partition coefficients. Adjustable 
parameters were estimated by fitting the models to data on butadiene and epoxybutene 
uptake in rats and mice exposed separately to these  gases in closed chambers. Although 
each model was fairly effective in reproducing buta diene uptake in rats and mice, they 
overpredicted blood levels of epoxybutene measured subsequently in rats and mice 
exposed to butadiene. This discrepancy was reduced by assuming that epoxybutene 
formed from butadiene is partially sequestered in an intrah epatic compartment that allows 
first-pass metabolism of epoxybutene by EH or by as suming that only a small fraction of 
butadiene (19–24%) is oxidized to epoxybutene. None  of the models included the 
formation or elimination of epoxybutanediol. 
Predictions of human blood levels of diepoxybutane are sensitive to parameters that 
affect the metabolism of butadiene to epoxybutene, the rate at which epoxybutene is 
oxidized to diepoxybutane and the rates of hydrolys is of epoxybutene and diepoxybutane.  
To address the finding that physiological models of  butadiene disposition that 
reproduced the uptake of this gas and epoxybutene f rom closed chambers but 
overpredicted blood concentrations of epoxybutene m easured subsequently in rats and 
mice exposed to butadiene, a modified model was pro posed in which epoxybutene 
formed from butadiene has privileged access to EH ( Kohn & Melnick, 2000; based on 
work of Oesch & Daly, 1972). This was then expanded  to include equations for the 
production and metabolism of butenediol and epoxybu tanediol (Kohn & Melnick, 2001). 
The model predicts higher concentrations of epoxybu tanediol than either epoxybutene or 
diepoxybutane in all metabolizing tissues of rats a nd mice at all butadiene exposures 
examined.  
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
The genetic toxicology of butadiene and its major m etabolites, epoxybutene and 
diepoxybutane, has been reviewed (IARC, 1999; Hende rson, 2001). 
4.2.1  Humans 
The HPRT  variant frequency in lymphocytes as well as the co ncentration of the 
urinary metabolite of butadiene, DHBMA, was examine d in 49 workers in a styrene–
butadiene rubber production facility in Texas, USA (Ammenheuser et al ., 2001). The 
study included 24 subjects who had high exposure an d 25 who had low exposure for 
HPRT  variant frequency analysis, 22 subjects who had hi gh exposure and 24 who had 
low exposure for dosimeter measurements and 24 who had high exposure and 23 who 
had low exposure for urine analyses. The mean value o f exposure to butadiene was 1.48 ± 
0.37 ppm [3.27 ± 0.82 mg/m 3] (mean ± standard error [SE]) for the high-exposure group 
and 0.15 ± 0.02 ppm [0.33 ± 0.04 mg/m 3] for the low-exposure group. The frequency of 
HPRT  variants was 6.66 ± 1.4 × 10 –6 (mean ± SE) for the high-exposure group and 2.10 ±  1,3-BUTADIENE 117  
 
 0.2 × 10 –6 for the low-exposure group ( p < 0.0002). When smoking status was considered, 
the frequency of HPRT  variants was 6.8 ± 1.2 × 10 –6 for 19 nonsmokers in the high-
exposure group and 1.8 ± 0.2 × 10 –6 for 20 nonsmokers in the low-exposure group 
(p < 0.0005). The concentration of DHBMA was 2046 ± 348 ng/mg creatinine in the 
urine of the high-exposure group compared with 585 ± 98 ng/mg creatinine in the urine of 
the low-exposure group ( p < 0.0005).  
Another study was conducted in the same styrene–but adiene facility in 1998 (Ward 
et al ., 2001). The frequency of HPRT  variants in lymphocytes as well as the concentratio n 
of the urinary metabolite of butadiene, DHBMA, were  examined in 37 workers (22 who 
had high exposure and 15 who had low exposure). The  mean value of exposure to 
butadiene was 1.71 ± 0.54 ppm [3.78 ± 1.2 mg/m 3] (mean ± SE) for the high-exposure 
group and 0.07 ± 0.03 ppm [0.15 ± 0.07 mg/m 3] for the low-exposure group. The 
frequency of HPRT  variants was 10.67 ± 1.51 × 10 –6 (mean ± SE) for the high-exposure 
group and 3.54 ± 0.61 × 10 –6 for the low-exposure group ( p < 0.001). The concentration 
of the metabolite was 378 ± 53 ng/mg creatinine in the urine of the high-expos ure group 
compared with 271 ± 50 ng/mg creatinine in the urine of the low-exposu re group. Unlike 
the previous study, this difference was not signifi cant ( p > 0.05).  
A subset of the workers from the Texas facility was  analysed for their frequency of 
HPRT  mutants (Ma et al. , 2000). HPRT  mutants were analysed by a multiplex 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the frequency o f large deletions in butadiene-
exposed workers (17.5%; 25/143) was significantly h igher than that in control subjects 
(9.7%; 21/217; p < 0.05). This increase in large deletions was due p rimarily to an increase 
in multiple exon deletions ( p < 0.05). When the HPRT  mutants were analysed for cDNA 
sequence mutations, the majority of the mutations obser ved in both exposure groups were 
single-base substitutions. However, the overall dis tribution of the types of mutation was 
significantly different between the two groups ( p < 0.05). A non-significant increase in 
mutations at AT sites was observed in butadiene-exp osed workers (46%) compared with 
the control group (39%), and the proportion of A:T →T:A transversions was also 
increased in the butadiene-exposed group (16%) comp ared with the control group (8%; 
p = 0.25). Three new mutable sites were identified a t positions 116, 370 and 410. The 
frequency of -1 frame shift mutations was significant ly higher (11%; p < 0.05) in exposed 
workers than in the controls (2%). Polymorphisms in  the mEH  gene may play a 
significant role in the sensitivity of humans to th e genotoxic effects of butadiene. In 
workers exposed to > 150 ppb [331.5 µg/m 3] butadiene, individuals who had at least one 
polymorphic mEH His  allele had a significant ( p < 0.001) threefold increase in the 
frequency of HPRT  variant (mutant) lymphocytes compared with individu als who had the 
Tyr/Tyr  genotype (Abdel-Rahman et al. , 2001). 
Blood samples from 19 exposed (butadiene monomer product ion unit) and 19 control 
(heat production unit) workers at a petrochemical c ompany in the Czech Republic were 
analysed for chromosomal aberrations and sister chr omatid exchange (Šrám et al ., 1998). 
The median exposure concentration of butadiene was 0.53 mg/m 3 [0.24 ppm] for the 
exposed group and 0.013 mg/m 3 [0.006 ppm] for the control group. A significant increase 118 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 in the percentage of aberrant cells was observed in  the exposed group (3.11 ± 1.33 versus 
2.03 ± 1.01%; p < 0.01). When smoking status was considered in the  exposed group, no 
difference in the percentage of aberrant cells was observed between smokers (3.11 ± 1.50) 
and nonsmokers (3.10 ± 1.24), although nonsmokers were exposed to nearly three times 
more butadiene (1.73 mg/m 3) than smokers (0.53 mg/m 3). There was also a significant 
increase in the frequencies of sister chromatid exchange p er cell in the exposed compared 
with the control groups (6.96 ± 1.51 and 4.87 ± 1.11 [mean ± SD], respectively; 
p < 0.001). 
A comparison of conventional cytogenetic analyses a nd fluorescence in-situ 
hybridization (FISH) was conducted among 82 workers  in a chemical plant in the Czech 
Republic (Šrám et al. , 2004). Twenty-three subjects worked in monomer pr oduction and 
were exposed to 0.642 mg/m 3 [0.3 ppm] butadiene, 34 worked in polymer producti on 
(1.794 mg/m 3 [0.812 ppm] butadiene) and 25 matched controls (0. 023 mg/m 3 [0.01 ppm] 
butadiene) worked in administration. Using both met hods, no significant differences in 
chromosomal aberration frequency were detected betw een any of the groups. When 
subjects with suspected clonality were excluded, re -analysis of the data by FISH found a 
significant difference between the polymer producti on workers (2.73 ± 1.51 genomic 
frequencies of stable chromosomal exchanges) and th e monomer production and control 
groups (1.72 ± 1.14 and 2.06 ± 1.31 genomic frequencies of stable chromosomal 
exchanges, respectively). 
A study that used several different biomarkers to d etermine the effects of exposure to 
butadiene on workers was undertaken in the Czech Re public (Albertini et al. , 2001). 
Eighty-three workers from the same industrial site were divided into three groups: 
controls (25 from administration), and monomer (24) and po lymer (34) workers. Polymer 
workers typically had levels of exposure (1.76 ± 4.69 mg/m 3 [0.8 ppm]) that were 
significantly higher than those of the monomer work ers (0.64 ± 2.06 mg/m 3 [0.29 ppm]) 
and controls (0.3 ± 0.03 mg/m 3 [0.14 ppm]). Analysis by autoradiography of HPRT  
mutations in 49 workers showed a significant differ ence between the control (10.75 ± 
6.11 × 10 –6) and the monomer (5.73 ± 4.72 × 10 –6) and the polymer workers (6.48 ± 4.77 
× 10 –6). This trend contradicts that expected. Analysis b y a cloning assay of HPRT  
mutations in 75 workers showed no significant diffe rences between the groups (controls, 
13.00 ± 8.1 × 10 –6; monomer workers, 10.69 ± 5.4 × 10 –6; polymer workers, 18.83 ± 
17.41 × 10 –6). Assays for sister chromatid exchange were comple ted for 73 study subjects. 
No significant differences were observed between th e groups. Chromosomal aberrations 
were analysed by traditional methods in 82 workers.  The mean percentages of cells with 
aberrations were 1.56, 1.52 and 1.54% for the contr ol, monomer and polymer groups, 
respectively. The mean number of chromosomal breaks  per cell was also similar between 
the groups. Chromosomal changes analysed by FISH al so showed no significant 
differences. [The Working Group noted the very high  levels of butadiene-derived 
metabolites in the urine of controls.]  
A Health Effects Institute Report summarized the st udy of workers in the Czech 
Republic (Albertini et al ., 2003a). The conclusions on the genotoxicity stud ies were that  1,3-BUTADIENE 119  
 
 ‘none of these measures showed positive responses a t exposure levels encountered in this 
study’. HPRT mutations analysed by cloning or autoradiographic t echniques showed no 
effect of butadiene, and mutation spectra were not s ignificantly different between exposed 
and unexposed workers. HPRT mutation frequencies were also unrelated to the metabolic  
genotypes examined. When smoking status was conside red, there was no significant 
effect of smoking and no significant exposure group -by-smoking interaction on HPRT  
mutation frequencies. Chromosomal aberrations analy sed by traditional or FISH methods 
and sister chromatid exchange were also unaffected by expos ure to butadiene. The results 
of the study by Šrám et al. (1998) were in conflict with these conclusions and showed 
increased chromosomal aberrations.  
Further molecular epidemiological analysis of butad iene-exposed workers in the 
Czech Republic was conducted to determine whether a ny gender differences in the 
response to butadiene existed (Albertini et al. , 2007). The average level of exposure to 
butadiene (mg/m 3) was 0.397 ± 0.502 (mean ± SD) [0.18 ppm] for the 23 women and 
0.808 ± 1.646 [0.37 ppm] for the 30 men. Thus, exposed male w orkers had a significantly 
higher level of exposure than female workers in thi s study. It should be noted that 
exposed male workers also had higher levels of expo sure to styrene than female workers 
and that exposed female workers had higher levels o f exposure to toluene and benzene 
than the exposed male workers. Although urinary con centrations of the mercapturic acid 
metabolites of butadiene, DHBMA and MHBMA, were hig her in butadiene-exposed 
women than in female controls, the differences were  not significant. The levels of both 
DHBMA and MHBMA ( µg/L) were significantly increased in male butadiene -exposed 
subjects (854.1 ± 567.0 and 47.9 ± 44.3, respectively) compared with male controls 
(512.8 ± 272.1 and 14.9 ± 10.3, respectively; p < 0.05). Thus, significantly higher 
concentrations of metabolites occurred in men than in women in both the control and 
exposed groups. HPRT  mutations measured by the T-cell assay did not diffe r significantly 
between exposed and control groups of either sex. N o significant associations between 
exposure to butadiene and sister chromatid exchange  or chromosomal aberrations were 
detected in either sex. Effects of genotype were al so examined. In this study, GSTT1 -null 
workers showed a significantly slower rise in the r ate of MHBMA excretion ( p < 0.05). In 
addition, individuals with the EH genotype that spe cifies low activity showed a 
significantly higher rise in urinary MHBMA/(DHBMA +  MHBMA) ratios with 
increasing exposure to butadiene.  
Zhang et al.  (2004) measured chromosomal changes in the periphe ral blood 
lymphocytes of 39 butadiene polymer production work ers and 38 unexposed controls in 
Yanshan, China. The median exposure level for the b utadiene-exposed workers as a 6-h 
TWA was 2 ppm [4.42 mg/m 3] whereas the control group had a median level of 0  ppm. 
Tobacco use was controlled for by including a similar perc entage of smokers with similar 
pack–years of smoking in both the control and expos ed groups. No significant numerical 
or structural chromosomal changes were detected usi ng FISH with probes for 
chromosomes 1, 7, 8 or 12. GSTT1  and GSTM1  genotypes had no significant effect on the 
frequency of hyperdiploidy of the above chromosomes  or on the frequency of structural 120 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 changes of chromosomes 8 and 12 in the butadiene-ex posed group. The EH EPHX1 
Y113H polymorphism had no effect on chromosomal dam age or HPRT mutant frequency 
in either the exposed or control workers. However, workers with the histidine arginine 
HR or RR allele of the EPHX1  H139R polymorphism had increased levels of 
hyperdiploidy of chromosomes 1, 7 and 8. Overall, p redicted EPHX1 activity did not 
influence genetic damage at low occupational exposu res to butadiene. Further analysis at 
this plant of 41 workers exposed to the same median  levels of butadiene (2 ppm) and 38 
controls was undertaken (Hayes et al ., 2001). No differences were observed in the 
Glycophorin A assay between the exposed workers and  the controls. The mutation 
frequency of HPRT  measured with the T-cell cloning assay was also no t significantly 
different and no significant increase was detected in sister chromatid exchange frequency. 
Another study at a tyre plant in the Slovak Republi c examined 110 workers, who 
were exposed to several xenobiotics of which butadi ene was the most prominent, for 
markers of genotoxicity in relation to several poly morphisms (Vodicka et al. , 2004). The 
workers were divided into three groups: high exposu re (butadiene concentration, 2.6 ± 0.2 
mg/m 3 [1.18 ppm]), low exposure (butadiene concentration , 2.3 ± 2.2 mg/m 3 [1.04 ppm]) 
and no exposure (trace amounts). The frequencies of  total chromosomal aberrations were 
significantly lower (1.3 ± 1.3; p < 0.01) in the low-exposure group compared with th e 
high- and no-exposure groups (2.2 ± 1.4 and 2.3 ± 1.1, respectively). No significant 
differences were observed in DNA single-strand breaks or in  single-strand break endo III-
sensitive site frequencies. A non-significant twofold h igher rate of DNA repair was found 
in the high-exposure group (0.6 ± 0.6 single-strand breaks/10 9 daltons) compared with the 
low- and no-exposure groups (0.3 ± 0.3 and 0.3 ± 0.4 single-strand breaks/10 9 daltons, 
respectively). A weak but non-significant associati on was found between CYP2E1 
expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the frequency of chromosomal 
aberrations ( r = 0.298; p = 0.097). In all individuals, assessment of severa l genetic 
polymorphisms suggested that individuals who had lo w EPHX1-activity genotypes had 
the highest level of chromosomal aberrations. Signi ficantly lower frequencies of 
chromosomal aberration ( p = 0.024) were detected in individuals who had the variant CC 
genotype associated with the XPD exon 23.  
A study of 27 healthy male Caucasian workers expose d to butadiene and 26 matched 
controls from an Italian petrochemical plant analys ed genotoxic effects (Lovreglio et al ., 
2006). The mean exposure to butadiene was 6.4 ± 14.0 µg/m 3 [0.003 ppm] for the 
butadiene-exposed workers which was significantly d ifferent from that of the controls 
(0.8 ± 1.1 µg/m 3 [0.0004 ppm]; p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed  in 
sister chromatid exchange, the percentage of cells with a high frequency of sister 
chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations or prol iferation index in the peripheral 
blood lymphocytes of these two groups. When subject s were classified according to 
smoking status, a significant increase was observed  in the mean frequency of sister 
chromatid exchange in smokers (6.6 ± 1.2) compared with nonsmokers (5.5 ± 0.8; 
p = 0.001). Exposure to butadiene was also higher in  smokers than in nonsmokers but this 
was not statistically significant ( p = 0.3).  1,3-BUTADIENE 121  
 
 4.2.2  Experimental systems 
(a) Butadiene (see Table 26 for details and references)  
The genotoxicity of butadiene has been reviewed pre viously (IARC, 1999). 
The frequency of DNA single-strand breaks was incre ased in NMRI mice exposed to 
butadiene in vivo .  
Decreases in cloning efficiency of T cells and a si gnificant increase in Hprt  mutation 
frequency  was observed in female B6C3F 1 mice exposed to 3 ppm [6.63 mg/m 3] 
butadiene for 2 weeks and in rats exposed to 62.5 p pm [138.1 mg/m 3] butadiene for 
2 weeks; these are the currently reported lowest-ob served-effect levels for butadiene that 
induced Hprt  mutations in mice and rats, respectively. The Hprt mutation frequency was 
also increased in Ephx -1 null and Xpc  (DNA repair enzyme) null mice exposed to 
butadiene for 4 weeks compared with normal mice.

mutants was carried out in male B6C3F 1 mice and Fischer 344 rats. The mean Hprt  
mutant frequency in mice was 9.20 ± 3.25 × 10 –6 in the butadiene-exposed animals 
compared with 1.48 ± 0.84 × 10 –6 ( p < 0.001) in the controls. In rats, the mean Hprt  
mutant frequency in the exposed animals was 8.08 ± 2.82 × 10 –6 compared with 3.07 ± 
0.98 × 10 –6 ( p < 0.001) in the controls. In mice, real time PCR a nd cDNA sequencing 
showed a statistically significant difference in th e overall proportion of mutation types 
detected in control versus butadiene-exposed mice ( p = 0.042), while multiplex PCR of 
genomic DNA showed that deletion mutations were sig nificantly increased in butadiene-
exposed mice ( p = 0.031). Analysis of the individual mutation type s that occurred in both 
treated and control mice showed that exposure to bu tadiene significantly increased the 
frequencies of each type of base substitution, exce pt for A:T →G:C transitions, and 
frameshifts and deletions. In male rats, no difference in t he overall mutational spectra was 
detected using cDNA sequencing alone or when combin ed with multiplex PCR. 
Statistical analyses of the individual mutation typ es showed that exposure to butadiene 
significantly increased base substitution at A:T →T:A transversions in both mice and rats, 
and single-base insertions, deletion mutations and complex mutations as well as 
G:C →C:G transversions in mice. 
In the bone marrow of B6C3F 1 LacI  transgenic mice exposed to butadiene, a 
significant increase in point mutations was observed at A:T base pairs compared with air-
exposed mice. In the spleen of the exposed mice, a significant increase in base 
substitution mutations (GC →AT transitions and GC →TA transversions at non-CpG 
sites) was detected, and a significant increase in A:T base pairs occurred, similar to that 
observed in the bone marrow.  
Micronucleus formation was increased in NMRI mice a nd male and female 
B6C3F 1/CrBR  mice exposed to butadiene. Male B6C3F 1 mice were exposed to butadiene 
and the bone marrow was harvested 24 h after onset of exposure (Jackson et al. , 2000). 
The frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic ery throcytes were significantly 
increased (28.2 ± 3.1/100 cells; p < 0.05) compared with controls (9.87 ± 2.1/100 cells ) as 122 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 determined by acridine orange staining. Two other m ethods to determine micronucleus 
frequency also showed similar results. 
The contribution of CYP2E1 to the genotoxicity of b utadiene was investigated by 
pretreating animals with 1,2- trans -dichloroethylene, a selective CYP2E1 inhibitor, an d 
1-aminobenzotriazole, an irreversible inhibitor of several CYPs, before exposure to 
butadiene (Jackson et al. , 2000). Pretreatment with 1,2- trans -dichloroethylene 
significantly lowered the micronucleus frequencies observed (19.8 ± 2.5) but the levels 
were still elevated over those in unexposed control s (11.5 ± 2.0). Pretreatment with 
1-aminobenzotriazole caused the micronucleus freque ncy to fall to a level similar to that 
in unexposed animals. The frequency of kinetochore- negative micronuclei was also 
significantly increased in butadiene-exposed animal s (21.3 ± 1.2) compared with controls 
(5.2 ± 1.7), indicating that butadiene is a clastogen. 
(b) Butadiene metabolites 
(i)  Epoxybutene (see Table 27 for details and references) 
Epoxybutene is mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  in the presence and absence of 
a metabolic activation system. 
The cII mutant frequency was increased only in Big Blue  mice but not rat 
fibroblasts in vitro . The in-vitro mutational spectrum induced by epoxy butene (1 mM for 
24 h) in Rat2 LacI cells was compared with a background spectrum. Signific ant increases 
in GC →AT transitions at non-CpG sites as well as GC →TA transversions (32% of the 
epoxybutene-induced mutations) were observed. At A: T base pairs, a significant increase 
was observed in AT →CG and AT →TA transversions. 
Epoxybutene increased micronucleus formation in bot h Big Blue rat and mouse 
fibroblasts. 
In a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line that does not  express active CYP2E1, the 
mutational spectrum at HPRT induced by epoxybutene showed a significant increas e in 
G:C →A:T and A:T →T:A mutations. The 2 S-stereoisomer increased the HPRT mutation 
frequency in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells whereas  the 2 R-isomer caused significant 
increases at higher doses only. 
Mean frequencies of sister chromatid exchange were s ignificantly increased in human 
whole blood lymphocyte cultures by epoxybutene in b oth the GSTM1 -null ( p < 0.001) 
and GSTM1 -positive ( p = 0.03) genotypes compared with unexposed controls . 
The effect of GSTM1  genotype as well as an adaptive dose of epoxybuten e on the 
induction of sister chromatid exchange was examined . Without an adaptive dose, both 
genotypes showed a significant increase in sister c hromatid exchange over controls. With 
the adaptive dose, the mean number of sister chroma tid exchanges was significantly 
higher following exposure to epoxybutene in the GSTM1 -null group (17.42 ± 2.43; 
p = 0.01) than in the control group (7.69 ± 1.00) or the GSTM1 -positive group (14.07 ± 
4.22). The results show an increased sensitivity of  GSTM1 -null subjects to the induction 
of sister chromatid exchange by epoxybutene.  1,3-BUTADIENE 129

 Epoxybutene did not induce sister chromatid exchang e or chromosomal aberrations in 
human blood lymphocytes when added at the G 0 stage of the cell cycle. However, from 
further studies in which excision repair was inhibi ted, it is probable that epoxybutene 
induces chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage that  is repaired by the excision 
process in G 0 lymphocytes (Kligerman et al ., 1999a,b). 
In vivo , a significant increase in mutation frequency was obs erved at the Hprt  locus in 
splenic T cells from female B6C3F 1 mice exposed to epoxybutene. Exposure to epoxy-
butene by inhalation resulted in an approximately t hreefold increase in the frequency of 
LacI  mutants in the lungs of female B6C3F 1 LacI  transgenic mice (8.3 ± 3.0 × 10 –5 and 
9.9 ± 3.0 × 10 –5) compared with air-exposed controls (3.1 ± 0.7 × 10 –5 and 3.6 ± 0.7 × 10 –5). 
Significant increases in GC →AT transitions at CpG sites ( p = 0.001) were detected. A 
number of other alterations (insertions, deletions and tandem changes) were also 
increased in the lungs of exposed mice (10/54, 10%)  compared with controls (2/59, 4%). 
When these alterations were considered separately, only the frequency of deletions was 
significantly increased ( p = 0.005). 
(ii) Epoxybutanediol (see also Table 28 for details and references) 
Epoxybutanediol has the least mutagenic potency of the butadiene epoxides in 
traditional mutagenic assays. 
Epoxybutanediol increased cII mutant frequency in B ig Blue  mouse but not rat 
fibroblasts.  
Mutational spectra of epoxybutanediol were obtained  in the Hprt  locus in Chinese 
hamster ovary-K1 cells. Of the 41 mutants analysed,  25 (61%) were base substitutions 
and 16 (39%) were deletions. The most common base s ubstitutions were GC →AT and 
AT →GC transitions. Among the deletions, the majority o f the mutants showed single 
exon loss.  
Epoxybutanediol increased micronucleus formation in  Big Blue  rat fibroblasts in 
vitro . The same effect was seen in Big Blue  mouse fibroblasts only at higher 
concentrations.  
Epoxybutanediol weakly suppressed the haematopoieti c progenitor clonogenic 
response in human CD34 + bone-marrow cells. 
(iii) Diepoxybutane (see also Table 29 for details and references) 
Diepoxybutane has been shown to be the most mutagen ic of the butadiene epoxides 
in traditional mutagenicity assays. 
Diepoxybutane is mutagenic in S. typhimurium , Escherichia coli  and Sulfolobus 
acidocaldarius  in the presence and absence of a metabolic activat ion system. 
Thirty-nine diepoxybutane mutants were analysed in Ch inese hamster ovary-K1 cells. 
Of these, 24 (62%) were base substitutions and 15 ( 38%) were deletions. The major base 
substitutions were GC →AT transitions (11/24) and AT →TA (5/24) and GC →CG (6/24) 
transversions. Among the deletions, the majority of  the mutants showed single exon loss.  1,3-BUTADIENE 133

 At low concentrations of diepoxybutane, increases i n the frequency of sister chromatid 
exchange were observed in Big Blue  mouse and rat fibroblasts and of micronucleus 
formation in Rat2  LacI  cells in vitro  (Erexson & Tindall, 2000b; Recio et al. , 2000, 2001). 
Increases in the HPRT  and thymidine kinase ( TK ) mutation frequency in human 
lymphoblastoid TK6 cells were observed with all iso mers (or the 2 R,3 R-, 2 S,3 S- and 
meso -stereoisomers) of diepoxybutane. The mutational sp ectrum of diepoxybutane at 
HPRT  in human TK6 cells after exposure to racemic diepo xybutane was compared with 
background. Significant increases in A:T →T:A transversions and partial deletions were 
detected. Diepoxybutane increased the frequencies o f sister chromatid exchange and 
micronucleus formation in human lymphocytes in vitro . Other genetic alterations such as 
chromosomal breakage and hyperdiploidy were observe d as the concentration of 
diepoxybutane increased. 
The effect of various polymorphisms on the frequenc y of sister chromatid exhange in 
whole blood lymphocytes from human volunteers after  in-vitro exposure to 
diepoxybutane was examined. A significant differenc e in sister chromatid exchange was 
observed between the GSTT1 -negative and GSTT1 -positive individuals (79.28 ± 23.33 
and 58.96 ± 17.44, respectively; p < 0.01). Individuals who were heterozygous for the C2 
allele in CYP2E1 (C1/C2), which is associated with higher enzyme activity, had higher 
levels of sister chromatid exchange (70.83 ± 10.85) compared with C1/C1 individuals 
(56.83 ± 17.64; p < 0.05). The RAD51  polymorphism as well as EH activity had no effect.  
In individuals with the GSTT1 -null genotype, a significant difference was observ ed in 
individuals with very low or low expected EH activi ty (72.13 ± 12.41) and in individuals 
whose activity was expected to be high (102.73 ± 21.22). Similar results were observed in 
an earlier study in which GSTT1 -null individuals had a sister chromatid exchange 
frequency of 84.8 ± 20.3 whereas individuals who were GSTT1 -positive had a frequency 
of 67.9 ± 10.8 ( p < 0.001). In this study, no effect was observed in  individuals with 
different GSTM1  genotypes (Schlade-Bartusiak et al. , 2000, 2004).  
After in-vivo exposure of female B6C3F 1 mice and Fischer 344 rats to diepoxybutane, 
dose-related increases in mutation frequency at the  Hprt  locus were observed in the 
splenic T cells of both species. LacI  transgenic mice and rats exposed to diepoxybutane 
showed no or a weak increase in LacI mutation frequency in the spleen and bone marrow. 
4.2.3  Mechanism of mutation induction 
(a) DNA adducts  
Many adducts with epoxybutene, epoxybutanediol and diepoxybutane have been 
identified in reactions with nucleosides and DNA in vitro  (see Table 30 for details and 
references). The mutagenicity and mutation spectra of several of these adducts have been 
investigated (see Table 31 for details and referenc es). Many of these adducts can also 
block replication by many polymerases or can cause misincorporation of proper 
nucleotides (see Table 32 for details and reference s). DNA adducts have been identified 
in humans exposed to butadiene and in animals expos ed to butadiene and its metabolites. 138 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 (i)  Butadiene 
Humans 
The levels of the DNA adduct, N-1-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)adenine, was determined 
in 15 male butadiene-exposed (monomer unit) and 11 male control workers from a 
butadiene monomer production plant in the Czech Rep ublic (Zhao et al. , 2000). The 
median exposure concentration of butadiene for the exposed group was 0.53 mg/m 3 
[0.24 ppm] whereas that for the control group was 0 .013 mg/m 3 [0.006 ppm]. Because of 
interfering background peaks, the N-1-adenine adducts were converted to N6-adenine 
adducts. This adduct was detected in 14 of 15 expos ed workers and five of 11 controls. 
The difference in the levels of adducts between the  butadiene-exposed workers (4.5 ± 7.7 
adducts/10 9 nucleotides) and the control workers (0.8 ± 1.2 adducts/10 9 nucleotides) was 
significant ( p = 0.038). When controls were subdivided into smoke rs and nonsmokers, the 
adduct levels were 1.5 ± 1.7 adducts/10 9 nucleotides for four smokers and 0.3 ± 0.6 
adducts/10 9 nucleotides for seven nonsmokers but the differenc e was not significant. A 
significant correlation between the levels of the N-1-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)adenine 
adduct in lymphocyte DNA and individual exposures t o butadiene was found in the 
exposed group ( r = 0.707; p = 0.005), control ( r = 0.733; p = 0.01) and both groups 
combined ( r = 0.723; p < 0.001; Zhao et al ., 2001). However, no significant correlations 
were found with other genotoxic effects such as DNA  single-strand breaks or 
micronucleus formation.  
Experimental systems 
1,4-Bis(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol is the N7-guanine– N7-guanine crosslink formed 
from the reaction of DNA with diepoxybutane. This c ompound has been identified in the 
livers and lungs of C57BL/6 mice that were exposed to 625 ppm  [1381 mg/m 3] butadiene 
by inhalation for 7 h per day for 5 days (Goggin et al. , 2007). The DNA from livers and 
lungs contained 3.2 ± 0.4 and 1.8 ± 0.5 adducts/10 6 guanines from racemic diepoxybutane 
but no adducts from meso -diepoxybutane were detected. 
Male B6C3F 1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 6 h to 200 ppm 
[442 mg/m 3] [2,3-14 C]butadiene by nose-only inhalation and were killed  48 h after 
treatment; the livers and lungs were analysed for D NA adducts (Boogaard et al ., 2001b). 
In the livers and lungs of both rats and mice, N7-(2,3,4-trihydroxybut-1-yl)guanine (G4) 
was the major adduct detected. Mice had 102 ± 4 and 80 ± 4 G4 adducts/10 8 nucleotides 
(means ± SE) and rats had 10 ± 2 and 13 ± 0.2 G4 adducts/10 8 nucleotides in the liver and 
lung, respectively. Smaller amounts of N7-(2-hydroxy-3-buten-1-yl)guanine (G1) and 
N7-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2-yl)guanine (G2) were detected.  Mouse liver and lung contained 
21 ± 9 and 3.4 ± 1.3 adducts/10 8 nucleotides, respectively, and rat liver and lung 
contained 1.9 ± 0.2 and 3.6 ± 1.2 adducts/10 8 nucleotides, respectively. In rats, no 
N7-(1,3,4-trihydroxybut-2-yl)guanine (G3) was detect ed whereas mouse liver and lung 
contained 25 ± 2 and 4.3 ± 0.1 adducts/10 8 nucleotides, respectively. A similar profile was 148 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 also obtained in animals that were killed immediate ly after cessation of exposure 
(Boogaard et al. , 2004). 
In another study, male B6C3F 1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 
20 ppm [44.2 mg/m 3] [2,3-14 C]butadiene for either 6 h or for 6 h per day for 5  days by 
nose-only inhalation, and the livers, lungs and tes tes were analysed for DNA adducts 
(Booth et al ., 2004b). Following the single 20-ppm exposure, G4  was the major adduct 
detected in all tissues in rats and mice. Mice had 13.91 ± 3.64, 13.67 ± 0.97 and 6.04 ± 
0.8 G4 adducts/10 8 nucleotides and rats had 5.75 ± 1.32, 3.31 ± 1.74 and 1.39 ± 0.50 G4 
adducts/10 8 nucleotides in liver, lung and testis, respectivel y. Small amounts of G3 (the 
exact identity was not determined) were detected co nsistently in mouse liver and in only 
one rat liver sample and was not detected in any oth er tissue. Following the 20-ppm 5-day 
exposure, G4 was again the main adduct detected and levels i n mouse tissues were higher 
than those in corresponding rat tissues. G1 and G2 were detected in the liver and lung of 
mice and rats but not in mouse testis; rats had det ectable levels in the testis. G3 was 
detected in mouse tissues and in the liver of rats.  The amounts of these other metabolites 
were much lower than that of G4. 
Female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 1000 ppm  [2210 mg/m 3] butadiene by 
inhalation for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for 1 3 weeks. DNA was isolated from the 
liver and was analysed for the presence of the α-regioisomer of HMVK-derived 1, N2-
propanodeoxyguanosine by LC–MS/MS (Powley et al ., 2007). No adducts were detected.  
Female B6C3F 1 mice and Fischer 344 rats were exposed by inhalati on to butadiene 
for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for 2 weeks (Oe et al ., 1999; Blair et al ., 2000). The 
mean daily concentration of butadiene was approxima tely 1250 ppm [2762.5 mg/m 3]. 
DNA was isolated and analysed for the presence of ( ±)-G4 and meso -G4. On exposure 
day 10, mouse liver had 3.9 and 2.2 ( ±)-G4 and meso -G4 adducts/10 6 normal bases, 
respectively. On the same exposure day, rat liver h ad 1.6 and 0.8 ( ±)-G4 and meso -G4 
adducts/10 6 normal bases, respectively. The in-vivo half-lives  were 4.1 and 5.5 days for 
(±)-G4 and meso -G4, respectively, in mouse liver DNA. Half-lives f or ( ±)-G4 and meso -
G4 in rat liver DNA were 3.6 and 4.0 days, respecti vely.  
DNA adducts were measured in the livers, lungs and kidneys of Fischer 344 rats and 
B6C3F 1 mice after exposure to 0, 20, 62.5 or 625 ppm [0, 44.2, 138 or 1381 mg/m 3] 
butadiene for 6 h per day or 5 days per week for 4 weeks (Swenberg et al. , 2000b). 
Adducts corresponding to the N7-guanine adducts of epoxybutene (G1 and G2) and th e 
2,3,4-trihydroxybutane–guanine adduct (G4) that can  be formed from either 
epoxybutanediol or diepoxybutane were analysed. More  G4 was detected in mice and rats 
than G1 and G2. In rats, adduct levels in the diffe rent tissues were similar. In general, 
mouse tissues contained higher levels of DNA adduct s. 
DNA adducts were measured in the livers, lungs and kidneys of Fischer 344 rats and 
B6C3F 1 mice after exposure to 0, 20, 62.5 or 625 ppm [0, 44.2, 138 or 1381 mg/m 3] 
butadiene for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for 4 weeks (Koc et al. , 1999). Both racemic 
and meso -G4 and G1 and G2 were analysed by LC–MS/MS. At 625  ppm [1381 mg/m 3] 
butadiene, mouse liver had 31.9 ± 6.5, 32.2 ± 4.2, 3.0 ± 0.1 and 2.4 ± 0.3 racemic G4,  1,3-BUTADIENE 149  
 
 meso - G4, G1 and G2 adducts/10 6guanine bases, respectively. At 625 ppm butadiene, rat 
liver had 7.7 ± 4.5, 4.2 ± 2.5, 1.2 ± 0.5 and 0.9 ± 0.5 racemic G4, meso - G4, G1 and G2 
adducts/10 6guanine bases, respectively. The number of adducts for both G4 and G1 and 
G2 was similar for all three tissues at all doses e xamined in both rats and mice. Mice had 
significantly higher amounts of G4 adducts than rat s in all three tissues after exposure to 
625 ppm. This difference was also significant in lu ng and kidney at 62.5 ppm but not at 
20 ppm. Overall, the amounts of G1 and G2 adducts were lower t han those of G4 adducts 
in both species.  
In the lungs of mice exposed to 500 ppm [1105 mg/m 3] butadiene for 6 h per day for 
5 days, N7-guanine DNA adducts arising from epoxybutene and epoxybutanediol were 
analysed (Koivisto & Peltonen, 2001). All four epox ybutene-derived adducts were 
detected, most of which arose from S-epoxybutene. For epoxybutanediol, 75% of the total  
adducts originated from the 2 R-diol-3S-epoxybutene isomer and the reaction occurred 
almost exclusively at the terminal carbon. 
Rats were exposed to 300 ppm [663 mg/m 3] butadiene for 6 h per day for 5 days and 
their liver DNA was analysed for the N6-(2,3,4-trihydroxy-but-1-yl)adenine adduct (Zhao 
et al ., 1998). The average level of adduct detected in t reated rats was 4.5 adducts/10 9 
nucleotides whereas none was detected in control ra t liver. 
(ii)  Butadiene metabolites in experimental systems 
Epoxybutene  
Male B6C3F 1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats received a single int raperitoneal 
injection of 1–50 mg/kg bw [ 14 C]epoxybutene and were killed 48 h later (Boogaard et al ., 
2004). DNA was isolated from liver and lung and ana lysed for the presence of adducts. 
No adducts were detected in the lungs in either rat s or mice. Adduct levels in the liver 
were below the limit of detection in rats treated with 1 mg/kg  bw and in mice treated with 
1 and 5 mg/kg bw epoxybutene. Overall, the adduct profiles w ere similar in rats and mice 
but rats had much higher levels of adducts than mic e. In mice treated with 21 mg/kg bw 
epoxybutene, the average concentrations of G1 and G 2, G3 and G4 were 368, 28 and 50 
adducts/10 8 nucleotides, respectively. In rats treated with 18  mg/kg bw epoxybutene, the 
concentrations of G1 and G2, G3 and G4 were 857 ± 291, 21 ± 12 and 101 ± 25 
adducts/10 8 nucleotides, respectively.   
The livers and lungs of male B6C3F 1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats that received an 
intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg bw [4-14 C]epoxybutene and were killed 48 h later 
were analysed for DNA adducts. In rats, 857 G1 and G2 adducts/10 8 nucleotides and 101 
G4 adducts/10 8 nucleotides were detected whereas 368 G1 and G2 ad ducts/10 8 
nucleotides and 50 G4 adducts/10 8 nucleotides were detected in mice (Boogaard et al. , 
2001b). No DNA adducts were detected in the lung. 
Butanediol 
Female B6C3F 1 mice and Fischer 344 rats were exposed by inhalati on to 0–36 ppm 
[0–129.6 mg/m 3] butanediol. DNA was isolated from liver and lung and analysed for the 150 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 presence of G4 (Powley et al ., 2005). Both racemic and meso -isomers of this compound 
can be formed and values were reported as total G4.  Mice had significantly greater 
amounts of adduct than rats in both liver and lung at 6 and 18 pp m [21.6 and 64.8 mg/m 3] 
but there was little difference between the tissue levels. At 6 ppm, mice had 6030 ± 1740 
and 5570 ± 540 fmol adducts/mg DNA whereas rats had 2560 ± 180 and 2320 ± 640 fmol 
adducts/mg DNA in the liver and lung, respectively.  Similarily shaped dose–response 
curves were observed for G4 and the Hprt mutant frequency in splenic T cells in rodents 
exposed to butanediol.  
However, when female Fischer 344 or Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to higher 
concentrations of butanediol (36 ppm or 1000 ppm, r espectively, for 6 h per day on 
5 days per week for 4 weeks), no adducts were detectab le in the DNA of the liver of these 
animals (Powley et al. , 2007). 
Diepoxybutane  
Diepoxybutane induces the formation of DNA–protein cross-links with the DNA 
repair protein, O6-alkylguanine–DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) (Loeber et al. , 2006). The 
product of initial DNA alkylation by diepoxybutane,  N7-(2'-hydroxy-3 ′,4 ′-epoxybut-1 ′-
yl)–deoxyguanosine, was incubated with recombinant human AGT and analysed by 
HPLC–electrospray ionization MS. Analysis of the whole p rotein showed the presence of 
a monoalkylated protein and a protein that containe d two butanediol cross-links. Peptide 
mapping revealed that the DNA–AGT cross-link involv ed the sulfhydryls of Cys 145  or 
Cys 150  within the human AGT active site and the N7 position of guanine in duplex DNA. 
No cross-linking was detected with Cys 5, Cys 24  or Cys 62 . The resulting structure was 1-( S-
cysteinyl)-4-(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol. 
The effect of the stereochemistry of the isomers of  diepoxybutane and their abilities to 
form cross-links with calf thymus DNA was investiga ted (Park et al ., 2005). Comparable 
amounts of total 1,4-bis-(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol  (bis-N7-guanine–butadiene) cross-
links and G4 adducts were observed. However, the ty pes of cross-link (either interstrand 
or intrastrand) varied depending on the stereoisome r used. S,S-Diepoxybutane produced 
the highest amount of 1,3 interstrand cross-links ( 96%) followed closely by racemic 
diepoxybutane (90%). meso -Diepoxybutane produced almost equal amounts of 1,3  
interstrand (49%) and 1,2 intrastrand cross-links ( 51%). R,R-Diepoxybutane produced 
19% 1,2 intrastrand cross-links and 68% 1,3 interst rand cross-links but also produced a 
large quantity of 1,2 interstrand cross-links (13%)  that were not detected with the other 
stereoisomers.  
N6-(2-Hydroxy-3,4-epoxybut-1-yl)adenine can potential ly be produced from the 
reaction of diepoxybutane with DNA. This compound a s well as its corresponding DNA 
oligomer have been synthesized (Antsypovich et al ., 2007). Yields of the compounds 
were lower than expected and both readily cyclized to an unidentified exocyclic 
diepoxybutane–deoxyadenosine side-product. Formatio n of cross-links by this compound 
was minimal. The half-life of N6-(2-hydroxy-3,4-epoxybut-1-yl)adenine in single-
stranded DNA was < 2 h at physiological conditions.    1,3-BUTADIENE 151  
 
 Calf thymus DNA incubated with a 40-fold molar exce ss of epoxybutene resulted in 
the detection of equimolar amounts of the two N7-guanine adducts of epoxybutene (G1 
and G2) (Blair et al ., 2000); when diepoxybutane was used, the ( ±)-G4 adduct was 
detected as the major product. When human TK6 cells  were exposed to 400 µM 
epoxybutene for 24 h, the concentration of G1 and G 2 adducts was 4.3 ± 0.9 and 4.1 ± 1.0 
adducts/10 6normal cells, respectively. Urine samples from Fisc her 344 rats and B6C3F 1 
mice exposed to 1250 ppm [3453 mg/m 3] butadiene were analysed for the presence of 
N7-guanine adducts. For all 3 days on which the addu cts were analysed, rats excreted 
significantly more G1 and G2 and ( ±)-G4; G1 was the major adduct excreted. In mice, a 
small amount of meso -G4 was detected but none was found in rat urine.   
DNA adducts were analysed in MCF-7 cells after a 6- h exposure to epoxybutanediol 
and diepoxybutane at concentrations of 100–1000 µmol/mg DNA (Koivisto et al. , 1999). 
At all concentrations tested, more diepoxybutane– N7-guanine adducts were detected. In 
the lungs of mice exposed to 50–1300 ppm [110.5–287 3 mg/m 3] butadiene for 6 h per 
day for 5 days, large amounts of epoxybutanediol– N7-guanine (G4) adducts were 
detected. A small peak for the adduct between diepo xybutane and guanine at N7 was 
detected; however, this peak also elutes closely wi th an epoxybutene-derived adduct. 
(b) Structural effects of the adducts on DNA 
The (2 R,3 R)-N6-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)-2'-deoxyadenosyl (BDT) DNA  adduct of 
epoxybutanediol causes low levels of A →G mutations and the (2 S,3 S)-BDT DNA adduct 
causes low levels of A →C mutations. These adducts were incorporated at the  X 6 position 
in the ras61  oligodeoxynucleotide that was then used to examine  structural perturbations 
in duplex DNA (Merritt et al. , 2004; Scholdberg et al ., 2004). Both adducts were 
orientated in the major groove of the DNA, which re sulted in minimal structural 
perturbation and allowed the Watson-Crick binding t o remain intact. However, the major 
difference between the two stereoisomers was the or ientation of the BDT moiety in the 
major groove. For the R,R-BDT adduct, the BDT moiety was orientated in plane  with the 
modified base-pair X 6.T 17  whereas the S,S-BDT adduct was tilted out of the base-pairing 
plane. This difference is due to differential interactions  of T 17 O4 with the hydroxyl groups 
of the BDT moieties. To determine if a structural basis exist ed for the low levels of A →C 
mutations observed with the (2 S,3 S)-BDT DNA adduct, it was incorporated site-
specifically into the ras61  oligodeoxynucleotide opposite a mismatched deoxygu anine in 
the complementary strand opposite the adducted deox yadenine (Scholdberg et al ., 2005a). 
Nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed two con formations of the adducted 
mismatched duplex. In the major conformation, the p resence of the trihydroxy adduct 
allowed formation of an A ⋅G mismatched base pair in which the adduct was in t he major 
groove of DNA and both mismatched bases were intrah elical. Thus, if this adduct is not 
repaired, the subsequent mismatch would result in t he observed A →C mutations. 
N1-[1-Hydroxy-3-buten-2( R)-yl]-2′-deoxyinosine, a DNA adduct of epoxybutene, is 
highly mutagenic in several systems and causes a la rge portion of A →G mutations. By 152 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 incorporating this adduct into the ras61  oligodeoxynucleotide at the second position of 
codon 61, positioning of the adduct in DNA could be  determined (Merritt et al. , 2005a). 
This adduct caused a significant structural perturb ation and showed the rotation of the 
adduct into a syn conformation, which placed the bu tadiene moiety into the major groove 
of the DNA duplex. This positioning disrupted Watso n-Crick hydrogen bonding and 
some altered base stacking was observed. This syn c onformation may also facilitate 
incorporation of desoxy cytosine triphosphate via H oogsteen-type templating with 
deoxyinosine and result in A →G mutations.  
N1-[1-Hydroxy-3-buten-2( S)-yl]-2′-deoxyinosine has been synthesized into an 
oligonucleotide that contained the epoxybutene addu ct at the second position of codon 61 
of the human N- ras  proto-oncogene (Scholdberg et al ., 2005b). The adducted 
deoxyinosine was rotated into a high syn conformati on, which allowed the adduct to be 
accommodated into the major groove of the DNA. This  conformation positions the adduct 
to form the protonated Hoogsteen-pairing interactio n with desoxy cytosine triphosphate 
during DNA replication thus generating A →G mutations. Some base–base stacking 
interactions were also perturbed.  
The effect of the 1,4-bis(2 ′-deoxyadenosin- N6-yl )–2R,3 R-butanediol cross-link in an 
oligonucleotide that contains the cross-link betwee n the second and third adenines of 
codon 61 in the human N- ras  proto-oncogene in duplex DNA was studied (Merritt et al. , 
2005b). The adduct was orientated in the DNA major groove. Watson-Crick base-pairing 
was disrupted at X 6⋅T17 . At the cross-link site, an opening of base-pair X6⋅T17  altered base 
stacking patterns and caused slight unwinding of th e DNA duplex.  
Examination of the effect of the 1,4-bis(2'-deoxyad enosin-N6-yl )-2S,3 S-butanediol 
cross-link was also undertaken in a manner similar to that for the R,R isomer (Xu et al ., 
2007). The adduct orientation was similar to that o f the R,R adduct and it also disrupted 
Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding at the same base pair . The largest difference between the 
S,S and R,R adducts was in the conformation of the butadiene ch ain. Because of the anti-
conformation of the two hydroxyl groups on the S,S adduct, a greater structural 
perturbation to the DNA duplex occurred, and result ed in a 10° bending of the cross-
linked duplex.  
Biochemical data suggest that both stereoisomers of  N6,N6-deoxyadenosine 
intrastrand cross-linked adducts are by-passed by a  variety of DNA polymerases, yet can 
be significantly mutagenic and lead to A →G transitions (Kanuri et al. , 2002). 
4.2.4  Alterations in oncogenes and suppressor genes in tumours 
A specific codon 13 mutation in K- ras  has been described previously (see IARC, 
1999). 
Lymphomas induced in B6C3F 1 mice by exposure to butadiene were analysed for 
gross structural alterations and point mutations in  several proto-oncogenes that are 
implicated in the ras , p53  or pRb  pathways (Zhuang & Söderkvist, 2000). Using southern 
blotting, no structural alterations or amplificatio ns were detected in Raf1 , Mdm2 , c-Myc ,  1,3-BUTADIENE 153  
 
 Cdc25a or Cdc25b . Ten tumours exhibited four identical silent base substitutions 
(GAC522AAC, GTG531GTC, TCG533TCC, GCT543ACT) and al lelotypic analysis 
showed loss of heterozygosity of the Raf1  locus in six of 31 butadiene-induced 
lymphomas. No changes were detected in lymphomas ind uced by long-term inhalation of 
20–625 ppm [44.2–1381 mg/m 3] butadiene in B6C3F 1 mice that were analysed for 
genetic alterations in Rb1 , Ccnd1  and Cdk4  genes. These results suggest that, if the 
inactivation of other tumour-suppressor genes may b e involved in the development of a 
subset of butadiene-induced lymphomas, the genetic alterations in the above proto-
oncogenes do not play an important role in the deve lopment of these tumours. 
Studies using the supF  gene and the three diepoxybutane isomers showed th at S,S-
diepoxybutane was the most potent mutagen followed by R,R-diepoxybutane and meso -
diepoxybutane (Kim et al.,  2007). The major form of mutation was A:T →T:A 
transversion following treatment with all three ste reoisomers. However, S,S-
diepoxybutane induced larger numbers of G:C →A:T transitions while R,R-diepoxybutane 
resulted in a higher frequency of G:C →T:A transversions. 
Rarely is the nervous system a target in chemical c arcinogenesis but, in B6C3F 1 mice 
exposed to 625 ppm [1381 mg/m 3] butadiene, six malignant gliomas and two 
neuroblastomas were observed. Only one tumour has b een reported in more than 500 
historical control mice. Morphologically, the chara cteristics of the malignant gliomas and 
neuroblastomas were consistent with those reported for humans. Tumours were also 
evaluated for genetic alterations in p53 , K- and H- ras  genes (Kim et al. , 2005). One 
neuroblastoma had a mutation in codon 61 of the H- ras  gene. Missense mutations in p53  
exons (exons 5–8) were detected in two neuroblastom as and three of six malignant 
gliomas and consisted mostly of G →A transitions (5/6). Three of five malignant glioma s 
and both neuroblastomas showed nuclear accumulation  of p53  protein. Loss of 
heterozygosity at the p53  gene locus was also observed in four of five malig nant gliomas 
and both neuroblastomas. All of these tumours displ ayed loss of the C57 (B) allele at the 
Ink4a/Arf  gene locus, which codes for the p16 Ink4a  that may play a key role in the 
development of mouse brain tumours. 
Male and female B6C3F 1 mice were exposed to a total of 8100 ppm [17 901 mg/ m 3]–
weeks and 16 200 ppm [35 802 mg/m 3]–weeks butadiene (Ton et al. , 2007). Of 51 lung 
tumours, 34 had a GGC →CGC transversion mutation in the codon 13 of the K- ras  gene. 
A loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 6 was observ ed in 14 of 51 of the lung tumours 
and all were in the region of K- ras . There is mounting evidence that K- ras , which is a 
known oncogene, functions as a tumour-suppressor ge ne and its loss may play a major 
role in mouse lung carcinogenesis.  
Point mutations in ras  genes were analysed in forestomach tumours from ma le and 
female B6C3F 1 mice that had been exposed to 6.25–625 ppm [13.8–1 381 mg/m 3] 
butadiene by inhalation for 6 h per day on 5 days p er week for 1–2 years (Sills et al ., 
2001). Among the butadiene-induced tumours, 20 of 2 4 contained ras  gene mutations 
compared with four of 11 spontaneous forestomach ne oplasms. In butadiene-induced 154 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 forestomach tumours, the most common transversions were GGC →CGC in codon 13 in 
K-ras , and CAA →CTA in codon 61 in H- ras . 
In male and female B6C3F 1 mice exposed to 6.25–625 ppm [13.8–1381 mg/m 3] 
butadiene by inhalation for 6 h per day on 5 days p er week for 2 years, an increase in the 
incidence of cardiac haemangiosarcomas was observed . Eleven of these haemangio-
sarcomas were analysed for alterations in the p53  gene and ras  proto-oncogenes (Hong et 
al ., 2000). Most of the butadiene-induced haemangiosa rcomas (9/11) had K- ras muta-
tions and all nine had G →C transversions in codon 13. Of the nine haemangios arcomas 
with the K- ras mutations, five also had an H- ras codon 61 CGA mutation. Mutations in 
exons 5–8 of the p53  gene were identified in five of 11 haemangiosarcom as. 
Butadiene-induced mammary tumours (17) were collect ed from female B6C3F 1 mice 
that were exposed to 6.25–625 ppm [13.8–1381 mg/m 3] butadiene by inhalation for up to 
2 years (Zhuang et al. , 2002). Genetic alterations in the p53 gene were found in seven of 
17 tumours. All of these tumours also showed loss o f the wild-type p53 allele. Missense 
mutations in codons 12, 13 or 61 of the H- ras gene were found in nine of 17 tumours. 
Seven of these nine H- ras  mutations were G →C transversions in the first base of codon 
13. Missense mutations in the β-catenin gene were identified in three of 17 tumour s. No 
mutations were identified in the Apc  or Axin genes.  
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
The carcinogenicity of butadiene is most probably m ediated by its metabolic 
intermediates. This view is based largely on the fa ct that butadiene-induced mutagenicity 
requires metabolic activation, and the DNA-reactive  epoxides formed during butadiene 
biotransformation are direct-acting mutagens (IARC,  1999; Melnick & Kohn, 1995). The 
first step in butadiene metabolism primarily involv es CYP-mediated oxidation to 
epoxybutene. At low concentrations of butadiene, me tabolism via CYP2E1 predominates 
(IARC, 1999). Epoxybutene may be metabolized by con jugation with GSH via GST or 
by hydrolysis via EH. Epoxybutene may also be oxidi zed to multiple diastereomers of 
diepoxybutane (Krause & Elfarra, 1997), while dihyd roxybutene formed by hydrolysis of 
epoxybutene may be oxidized to epoxybutanediol. The  latter epoxides are also detoxified 
by GST or EH. Partial hydrolysis of diepoxybutane a lso produces epoxybutanediol. Each 
of these epoxide intermediates may contribute to th e mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of 
butadiene. Factors that impact their relative contr ibutions include tissues levels, reactivity 
with DNA and repair of covalent DNA adducts. For ex ample, genetically modified mice 
that are deficient in mEH activity are more suscept ible than wild-type mice to the 
mutagenic effects of butadiene and diepoxybutane (W ickliffe et al. , 2003). The detection 
of metabolites derived from HMVK and crotonaldehyde  in the urine of rats or mice 
treated with butenediol suggests that these compoun ds may also be formed during the 
metabolism of butadiene (Sprague & Elfarra, 2003, 2 004). The potential contributions of 
these DNA alkylating agents (crotonaldehyde and HMV K) to the mutagenicity and 
carcinogenicity of butadiene are not fully known.   1,3-BUTADIENE 155  
 
 The enzymes that regulate epoxide formation and eli mination are polymorphic in 
human populations. While there are reports that ind icate that genetic polymorphisms in 
GST and mEH affect the in-vitro mutagenicity of but adiene-derived epoxides or the 
mutagenicity of butadiene in occupationally exposed  workers (Wiencke et al. , 1995; 
Abdel-Rahman et al. , 2003), the extent to which these enzyme variabili ties impact the 
carcinogenicity of butadiene is not known. In addit ion, CYP is inducible by a variety of 
environmental and pharmaceutical agents. The report ed range and distribution of 
butadiene or epoxybutene oxidation kinetics in huma n tissues in vitro  is limited by the 
high interindividual variability in CYP, EH and GST  activities and the fact that small 
numbers of human liver and lung samples have been a nalysed (Bolt et al. , 2003; Thier et 
al. , 2003; Norppa, 2004; Schlade-Bartusiak et al. , 2004).  
The metabolism of butadiene in mice and rats demons trates linear metabolic 
elimination kinetics at exposures of up to about 10 00 ppm [2210 mg/m 3] (Kreiling et al. , 
1986b). Toxicity studies conducted with much higher  exposures add little additional 
information on the health effects of butadiene meta bolites due to saturation of butadiene 
metabolism. Responses that increase proportionally with exposures above 1000 ppm 
butadiene probably represent effects of the parent compound. In the range of linear 
kinetics, mice metabolize butadiene at about twice the rate observed in rats. Species 
differences in metabolic clearance of butadiene at l ow exposure concentrations are largely 
due to differences in blood:air partition coefficie nts and physiological parameters that 
include alveolar ventilation rate, cardiac output a nd blood flow to metabolizing tissues 
(Kohn & Melnick, 1993; Sweeney et al. , 2001).  
Although the formation of epoxybutene occurs primar ily by CYP-mediated oxidation 
of butadiene, formation of this alkylating agent by  a myeloperoxidase-catalysed reaction 
in bone-marrow cells (Maniglier-Poulet et al. , 1995) may be relevant to the induction of 
haematopoietic cancers in mice and humans.  
Data on urinary metabolites indicate that the elimi nation of epoxybutene in mice 
occurs to a greater extent by conjugation with GSH than by hydrolysis (IARC, 1999). 
Although no studies have been reported that charact erize the full profile of urinary 
metabolites for butadiene in humans, the high ratio  of DHBMA to MHBMA in exposed 
workers indicates that epoxybutene is preferentiall y metabolized by hydrolysis before 
GSH conjugation in humans. In rats, metabolic elimi nation of epoxybutene formed from 
butadiene occurs to a similar extent by hydrolysis or GSH conjugation. In molecular 
epidemiological studies of occupational exposures t o butadiene, the ratio of MHBMA to 
MHBMA + DHBMA was lower in workers who had homozygo us null genotypes for 
GSTM1  and GSTT1  (Albertini et al. , 2001, 2003a). 
The formation of epoxybutanediol or diepoxybutane r equires a second oxidation step 
on either butenediol or epoxybutene, respectively. At increasing exposure concentrations 
of butadiene, competition between butadiene and but enediol or epoxybutene for CYP 
may limit the extent to which the second oxidation reaction may occur. Consequently, the 
blood concentration of epoxybutanediol is greater i n rats exposed to 200 ppm 
[442 mg/m 3] butadiene than in those exposed to levels of 1000  ppm [2210 mg/m 3] or 156 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 higher (Filser et al. , 2007). Competitive inhibition by butadiene of the  second oxidation 
(Filser et al ., 2001) may account for the greater Hprt  mutation efficiency in rats exposed 
to 62.5 ppm [138 mg/m 3] or mice exposed to 3 ppm [6.63 mg/m 3] compared with 
exposure of either species to 625 or 1250 ppm [1381  or 2762.5 mg/m 3] (Meng et al ., 
2007a). Thus, high-dose studies of butadiene in ani mals ( ≥ 625 ppm) may not adequately 
reveal the full carcinogenic potential of this gas at lower levels of exposure. 
Haemoglobin adducts have been measured as biomarker s of internal levels of the 
epoxide intermediates of butadiene metabolism. Leve ls of MHbVal, PyrVal and THbVal 
adducts are reflective of blood concentrations of e poxybutene, diepoxybutane and 
epoxybutanediol, respectively. Each of these adduct s has been measured in rats and mice 
exposed to butadiene at concentrations as low as 3 ppm [6.63 mg/m 3]. At equivalent 
exposures to butadiene, the levels of MHbVal and Py rVal were higher in mice than in 
rats, while levels of the major adduct, THbVal, wer e similar in these species (Boysen et 
al ., 2004, 2007). The formation of each of these addu cts in mice and rats was more 
efficient at 3 ppm than at higher exposure concentr ations of butadiene. MHbVal and 
THbVal have also been measured in workers exposed t o butadiene (mean 8-h TWA 
exposures of 0.3–0.8 ppm [0.66–1.76 mg/m 3]), while levels of PyrVal in workers exposed 
to mean concentrations of 0.37 ppm [0.82 mg/m 3] were below the limit of detection 
(Albertini et al ., 2003a, 2007). Species differences in the levels of these haemoglobin 
adducts reflect differences in exposure to butadien e, blood levels of the epoxide 
intermediates, reactivity of the epoxide with the N-terminal valine and other reactive sites 
of haemoglobin and the half-life of red blood cells . When adduct levels are normalized 
per gram of haemoglobin per part per million of butadiene, th e levels of MHbVal adducts 
in workers are slightly lower than those in rats exposed to 3 p pm [6.63 mg/m 3] butadiene, 
while the levels of THbVal adducts are higher in wo rkers than in rats or mice exposed to 
3 ppm butadiene. These data demonstrate the systemi c availability of epoxybutene and 
epoxybutanediol in workers at occupational exposure  levels of butadiene. In workers 
exposed to butadiene, THbVal levels are affected by  the combined polymorphisms for 
CYP2E1 , GSTM1  and GSTT1  genes (Fustinoni et al. , 2002).  
The major DNA adducts formed in the liver, lung and  kidney of rats and mice 
exposed to butadiene are at the N7 position of guanine. G4 adducts are much more 
abundant than G1 and G2 adducts, which are derived from epoxybutene (Koc et al. , 
1999). G4 adducts reach a plateau in rats at about 62 ppm [137 mg/m 3] butadiene, while 
G1 and G2 adducts increase nearly linearly with exposures to  butadiene of up to 625 ppm 
[1381 mg/m 3]. The similarity in the shape of the dose–response  curves for the formation 
of THbVal adducts, G4 adducts and the Hprt  mutation frequency in splenic T cells from 
mice and rats exposed to butenediol suggests that e poxybutanediol may play a role in the 
mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of butadiene (Powley et al. , 2005). N7-Guanine adducts 
can undergo spontaneous depurination from DNA and c reate apurinic sites. Epoxide 
metabolites of butadiene can also react at base-pai ring sites to form adducts at 
N3-cytosine, N1-adenine, N6-adenine, N1-guanine and N2-guanine (Selzer & Elfarra, 
1996a,b, 1997; Zhao et al. , 1998; Zhang & Elfarra, 2004). An increase in N1- 1,3-BUTADIENE 157  
 
 trihydroxybutyladenine adducts was detected in lymp hocytes of workers occupationally 
exposed to butadiene (Zhao et al ., 2000). Alkylation of N1-adenine by epoxybutene 
followed by hydrolytic deamination to form deoxyino sine has been shown to be highly 
mutagenic (Rodriguez et al. , 2001); this DNA lesion strongly codes for incorpo ration of 
cytosine during DNA replication which leads to the generation of A →G mutations. 
Diepoxybutane is a bifunctional alkylating agent th at can form DNA–DNA crosslinks 
through binding at the N7 position of guanine of double-stranded DNA to pro duce bis-
N7-guanine-2,3-butanediol (Park & Tretyakova, 2004).  Depurination of these interstrand 
or intrastrand lesions can induce point mutations a nd large deletion mutations. However, 
when diepoxybutane alkylates an N6-adenine in DNA, an exocyclic adenine adduct is 
formed preferentially to DNA–DNA cross-linked produ cts (Antsypovich et al. , 2007).   
Butadiene and its epoxide metabolites are genotoxic  at multiple tissue sites in mice 
and rats and in a variety of other test systems. In -vitro studies demonstrate that 
diepoxybutane is more potent than epoxybutene or ep oxybutanediol in the induction of 
micronuclei and gene mutations in mammalian cells. Epoxybutanediol, epoxybutene and 
diepoxybutane induced G →A transition mutations, adenine mutations (A →T and A →G) 
and deletions (Recio et al. , 2001; Lee et al. , 2002). The observed base substitution 
mutations induced by these alkylating agents are co nsistent with their DNA adduct 
profiles. A →T and G →C transversions are the most common mutations obser ved after 
in-vivo exposure to butadiene or in-vitro exposure to epoxybutene or diepoxybutane.  
Markers of individual susceptibility can modulate t he genotoxic effects of butadiene. 
In experimental studies, mice that lack a functional  mEH gene were more susceptible than 
wild-type mice to the mutagenic effects of butadien e or diepoxybutane (Wickliffe et al. , 
2003). EH activity varies considerably among indivi duals. Butadiene-exposed workers 
with the low EH activity genotype were reported to be more susceptible to butadiene-
induced genotoxicity (lymphocyte HPRT mutant variant frequency) than individuals with 
the more common EH genotype (Abdel-Rahman et al. , 2001, 2003). In contrast, no 
significant effects were observed for induction of HPRT mutations or sister chromatid 
exchange in individuals with GST  (M1 or T1) polymorphisms (Abdel-Rahman et al. , 
2001). These differences in response are consistent  with the known important role of EH 
in the detoxification of butadiene epoxides in tiss ues in which these intermediates are 
produced. Several other molecular epidemiological s tudies report no effect of butadiene 
on HPRT mutations or chromosomal changes at levels of occup ational exposures and no 
significant associations with genotype (Zhang et al. , 2004; Albertini et al. , 2001, 2007). 
Discrepancies among these studies may be related to  differences in workplace levels of 
exposure to butadiene, the impact of exposures to b utadiene or other genotoxic agents 
from other sources (e.g. cigarette smoke, automobil e exhaust), group size and the level of 
enzyme activity associated with a particular genoty pe.  
The induction of sister chromatid exchange in human  lymphocytes exposed in vitro  to 
diepoxybutane was significantly higher in lymphocytes fro m GSTT1 -null individuals than 
GSTT1 -positive individuals (Wiencke et al. , 1995), which indicates that the GST pathway 
may be important in the detoxification of diepoxybu tane released into whole blood. 158 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 Epoxybutene can induce sister chromatid exchange an d chromosomal aberrations in 
human peripheral lymphocytes treated in vitro ; the lack of induction of these effects in G 0 
lymphocytes appears to be due to effective DNA exci sion repair (Kligerman et al. , 
1999b). Other studies demonstrate the importance of  DNA repair in the genotoxicity of 
butadiene-derived epoxides. For example, mice defic ient in nucleotide excision repair 
activity are more susceptible than wild-type mice t o the mutagenic effects of butadiene 
and diepoxybutane (Wickliffe et al. , 2007).  
The mechanistic link between animal and human neopl asia induced by butadiene is 
supported by the identification in mice of genetic alterations in butadiene-induced 
tumours that are frequently involved in the develop ment of a variety of human cancers. 
The K-ras,  H-ras,  p53 , p16 /p15  and β-catenin  mutations detected in tumours in mice 
probably occurred as a result of the DNA reactivity  and genotoxic effects of butadiene-
derived epoxides. A consistent pattern of K- ras  mutations (G →C transversions at codon 
13) was observed in butadiene-induced cardiac haema ngiosarcomas, neoplasms of the 
lung and forestomach and lymphomas (Hong et al. , 2000; Sills et al. , 2001; Ton et al. , 
2007). Alterations in the p53  gene in mouse brain tumours were mostly G →A transition 
mutations (Kim et al. , 2005). Inactivation of the tumour-suppressor gene s p16  and p15  
may also be important in the development of butadie ne-induced lymphomas (Zhuang et 
al. , 2000). Mammary gland adenocarcinomas induced by b utadiene in mice had frequent 
mutations in the p53 , H-ras  and β-catenin  genes (Zhuang et al. , 2002). These obser-
vations point to a genotoxic mechanism that underli es the development of butadiene-
induced cancers. Although genotoxicity data indicat e that diepoxybutane is the most 
genotoxic of the butadiene epoxides, the relative c ontribution of these metabolic inter-
mediates to the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of  butadiene is not known.  
A comparison of the degree of evidence on metabolis m, haemoglobin adduct 
formation and genetic changes in rodents and humans  exposed to butadiene is given in 
Table 33.

5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
1,3-Butadiene is a colourless gas that is produced by three different methods. More 
than 95% of global production is as a co-product fr om the industrial synthesis of ethylene. 
Regardless of the process, the production of butadi ene monomer requires the removal of 
impurities. Butadiene is used primarily (85%) in th e production of synthetic rubbers and 
polymers (polymer production). 
The highest exposure to butadiene occurs in occupat ional settings. No measurements 
of exposure in butadiene monomer production before the 1970s are available, but levels 
of exposure have decreased from the late 1970s to t he early 2000s from < 20 mg/m 3 to 
< 2 mg/m 3.  
In styrene–butadiene polymer production, the estima ted median levels of exposure to 
butadiene in earlier decades varied from 8 mg/m3 to  20 mg/m 3, while current measure-
ments of exposure in modern facilities in North Ame rica and western Europe are 
generally below 2 mg/m 3. Levels reported in China are somewhat higher ( ∼4 mg/m 3). 
Regardless of the type of factory, production proce ss or country, some tasks are still 
characterized by very high exposures (~200 mg/m 3) that are typically short in duration.  
Butadiene is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant  and levels lower than those 
found in occupational settings have been reported i n ambient air (< 0.02 mg/m 3); these 
mainly originate from combustion products (e.g. mot or vehicle emissions and tobacco 
smoke). 160 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has reported 
occupational exposure limits for butadiene in vario us countries that range from 1 to 
1000 ppm (2–2210 mg/m 3). 
5.2 Cancer in humans 
The Working Group reviewed studies of three cohorts  of workers in the butadiene 
monomer industry and two cohorts of workers in the styrene–butadiene rubber industry. 
A study of styrene–butadiene rubber workers by researchers  at the University of Alabama 
at Birmingham was considered by the Working Group t o be the most informative. This 
study examined the mortality rates of approximately  17 000 workers from eight styrene–
butadiene rubber facilities in the USA and Canada. E arlier studies of some of the facilities 
included in this study were carried out by research ers at the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health and at Johns Hopkins ’ University.   
A limiting factor in the present evaluation was tha t the diagnosis and classification of 
lymphatic and haematopoietic malignancies are extre mely complex and have undergone 
several changes over the course of time (see Genera l Remarks). 
Although overall mortality from leukaemia was only slightly elevated in the most 
recent update of the University of Alabama at Birmi ngham cohort, larger excesses of 
mortality from leukaemia were seen in workers in th e most highly exposed areas of the 
plants and among hourly paid workers, especially th ose who had been hired in the early 
years and had had longer employment (i.e. ≥ 10 years). These excesses were attributable 
to increased rates of mortality from both chronic l ymphocytic and chronic myelogenous 
leukaemia. Furthermore, a significant exposure–resp onse relationship between cumu-
lative exposure to butadiene and mortality from leu kaemia was observed in this study. 
Exposure–response relationships were apparent for both c hronic lymphocytic and chronic 
myelogenous leukaemia. An exposure–response relatio nship between cumulative expo-
sure to butadiene and leukaemia was also apparent in an earl ier analysis conducted by the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham that used a dif ferent method for the assessment of 
exposure and in the previous Johns Hopkin’s study. While concerns had been raised that 
these findings might have been due to confounding f rom exposure to other chemicals in 
the styrene–butadiene rubber industry, the most rec ent analyses indicated that the 
exposure–response relationship for butadiene and le ukaemia was independent of expo-
sures to benzene, styrene and dimethyldithiocarbama te.  
A slight overall excess of mortality from leukaemia  was also observed in two of the 
studies of the butadiene monomer industry, whereas a small deficit in mortality was 
observed in the third cohort study. The excess of m ortality from leukaemia in one of the 
monomer industry cohorts was more pronounced among workers who had been exposed 
during the Second World War when exposures to butad iene had probably been higher. 
The excess of leukaemia in this cohort did not incr ease with duration of exposure or 
cumulative exposure.  1,3-BUTADIENE 161  
 
 The strongest evidence for an association between b utadiene and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma derives from the studies of workers in the  monomer industry. Based on four 
cases (lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma), an appro ximately sixfold statistically 
significant excess risk was observed in one of the three studies. An approximately 50% 
non-significant excess of mortality from non-Hodgkin lym phoma was reported in another 
study of the monomer industry. Although the excess of mortality from non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma in this study did not increase with durati on of exposure, it was more 
pronounced among workers who had been exposed durin g the Second World War when 
exposures had presumably been higher. The third study of the  monomer industry reported 
only one case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.2 expected ). A non-significant twofold 
excess of mortality from lymphosarcoma and reticulo sarcoma was reported in one of the 
two plants included in the earlier National Institu te for Occupational Safety and Health 
study of styrene–butadiene rubber workers. No overa ll excess of mortality from non-
Hodgkin lymphoma was observed in the University of Alabama at Birmingham study. 
Overall, the epidemiological studies provide eviden ce that exposure to butadiene 
causes cancer in humans. This excess risk cannot be  reasonably explained by 
confounding, bias or chance. This conclusion is pri marily based on the evidence for a 
significant exposure–response relationship between exposure to butadiene and mortality 
from leukaemia in the University of Alabama in Birm ingham study, which appears to be 
independent of other potentially confounding exposu res. It is also supported by elevated 
relative risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in other st udies, particularly in the butadiene 
monomer production industry. The Working Group was unable to determine the strength 
of the evidence for particular histological subtype s of lymphatic and haematopoietic 
neoplasms because of the changes in coding and diag nostic practices for these neoplasms 
that have occurred during the course of the epidemi ological investigations. However, the 
Working Group considered that there was compelling evidence that exposure to butadiene 
is associated with an increased risk for leukaemias . 
5.3 Cancer in experimental animals 
Two bioassays of butadiene by inhalation exposure i n mice showed increases in the 
incidence of lymphoma and neoplasms of the heart, l ung, forestomach, liver, Harderian 
gland, preputial gland and kidney in males and incr eases in the incidence of lymphomas 
and neoplasms of the heart, lung, forestomach, live r, Harderian gland, ovary and 
mammary gland in females. The heart neoplasms were highly malignant and distinctive 
forms of haemangiosarcoma that were very rare in hi storical controls. The second 
bioassay was undertaken at much lower exposure leve ls than the first, but tumours 
developed at the same organ sites in both studies. The second study included exposure 
levels that were comparable with or even lower than  historical levels of occupational 
exposure in humans. 
In a single study of inhalation exposure in rats, b utadiene caused increases in the 
incidence of pancreatic exocrine adenomas and carci nomas and interstitial-cell tumours of 162 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 the testis in males. In females, increases in the i ncidence of thyroid follicular-cell 
tumours, uterine sarcomas, Zymbal gland carcinomas and benign and malignant 
mammary tumours were observed. This study was conducted at e xposure levels that were 
much higher than those used in the inhalation bioas says in mice. 
D,L-Diepoxybutane, a metabolite of butadiene, was test ed for carcinogenicity in mice 
by repeated subcutaneous injection, by repeated int raperitoneal injection and by inhalation 
exposure. It caused fibrosarcomas at the site of su bcutaneous injection and increased the 
incidence of Harderian gland tumours following inha lation exposure. 
D,L-Diepoxybutane was tested for carcinogenicity in ra ts in one study by inhalation 
and caused squamous-cell carcinomas of the nasal mu cosa. It also induced fibrosarcomas 
in rats at the site of repeated subcutaneous inject ion, but did not cause gastric tumours 
when administered by gavage. 
meso -Diepoxybutane was tested for carcinogenicity by sk in application in one study 
in male and one study in female mice in direct comp arison with D,L-diepoxybutane. In 
both studies, meso -diepoxybutane caused an increased incidence of squ amous-cell 
papillomas and carcinomas of the skin at the site o f application while D,L-diepoxybutane 
gave negative results. 
5.4 Mechanistic and other relevant data 
The carcinogenicity of butadiene is most probably m ediated by its metabolic 
intermediates. This assumption is based largely on the fact that butadiene-induced 
mutagenicity requires metabolic activation and that  the DNA-reactive epoxides 
(stereoisomers of epoxybutene, epoxybutanediol and diepoxybutane) that are formed 
during the biotransformation of butadiene are direc t-acting mutagens. Studies in humans 
indicate that butadiene is absorbed via inhalation and that the blood:air partition 
coefficient and alveolar ventilation are important parameters in the determination of 
uptake. Several studies have quantified the presenc e of metabolites derived from 
butadiene in the urine of humans exposed via inhala tion in controlled laboratory, 
environmental or workplace settings. Two urinary me tabolites have been identified in 
humans: 1,2-dihydroxybutyl mercapturic acid and mon ohydroxy-3-butenyl mercapturic 
acid, which are derived from the conjugation with g lutathione of hydroxymethylvinyl 
ketone (a metabolite of butenediol) and epoxybutene , respectively.  
Several molecular epidemiological studies have asse ssed the utility of haemoglobin 
adducts as biomarkers of human exposure to butadien e. The butadiene metabolite, 
epoxybutene, can react with the N-terminal valine of haemoglobin to form N-(2-hydroxy-
3-butenyl)valine adducts, which have been observed in workers exposed to butadiene. 
The haemoglobin adduct, N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)valine, which is formed fro m 
epoxybutanediol or diepoxybutane, has also been obs erved in these workers. N,N-(2,3-
Dihydroxy-1,4-butadiyl)valine, which is another add uct formed by the reaction of 
diepoxybutane with haemoglobin, has not been detect ed in butadiene-exposed workers. 
The presence of N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)valine and N-(2-hydroxy-3-butenyl)valine in  1,3-BUTADIENE 163  
 
 workers exposed to butadiene demonstrates the syste mic availability of the metabolites 
epoxybutene and epoxybutanediol at occupational exp osure levels. 
Several studies in humans have demonstrated the DNA -binding properties and 
clastogenic effects of butadiene. An increase in N1-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)adenine 
adducts — derived from epoxybutanediol or diepoxybu tane — was detected in the 
lymphocytes of workers occupationally exposed to bu tadiene. One study in workers 
exposed to butadiene found an increase in the frequ ency of chromosomal aberrations and 
sister chromatid exchange. Other studies found no s ignificant increases in chromosomal 
alterations in workers, although the exposure conce ntrations were lower than those used 
in studies with mice. 
The enzymes that regulate epoxide formation and eli mination are polymorphic in 
human populations. The extent to which the variabil ities of these enzymes modulate the 
carcinogenicity of butadiene is not known. Butadien e-exposed workers with the low 
epoxide hydrolase activity genotype were more susce ptible to butadiene-induced geno-
toxicity (frequency of human hypoxanthine –guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene 
variants in lymphocytes). 
More than 10 urinary metabolites, including the con jugation products monohydroxy-
3-butenyl mercapturic acid and 1,2-dihydroxybutyl mer capturic acid, have been identified 
in butadiene-exposed rats and mice. 
At equivalent exposures to butadiene, blood levels of the haemoglobin adducts N-(2-
hydroxy-3-butenyl)valine and N,N-(2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-butadiyl)valine were higher in 
mice than in rats, while levels of the major adduct , N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)valine, were 
similar in these species. All of these adducts have  been measured in rats and mice 
exposed to butadiene at concentrations as low as 3 ppm (6 mg/m 3).  
Butadiene is clastogenic in mice and induces chromo somal aberrations, micronucleus 
formation and sister chromatid exchange. It has not  been found to be clastogenic in rats.  
The most abundant DNA adduct measured in rats and m ice exposed to butadiene is 
N7 -trihydroxybutylguanine, which is derived from eith er epoxybutanediol or diepoxy-
butane. Epoxide metabolites of butadiene can also r eact at base-pairing sites to form 
adducts at N3-cytosine, N1-adenine, N6-adenine, N1-guanine and N2-guanine. Butadiene 
and its epoxide metabolites are genotoxic at multip le tissue sites in mice and rats and in a 
variety of other test systems. 
Mutations in ras  proto-oncogenes and the p53  tumour-suppressor gene (genes that are 
involved in the development of a variety of cancers ) were identified in several different 
types of tumour induced by butadiene in mice. A →T and G →C transversions are the 
most common mutations observed after in-vivo exposu re to butadiene or in-vitro 
exposure to epoxybutene or diepoxybutane. 
Although genotoxicity data indicate that diepoxybuta ne is the most genotoxic epoxide 
formed from butadiene, the relative contribution of  all epoxide metabolites to the 
mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of butadiene is no t known.  164 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

1.1.4  Technical products and impurities 
Ethylene oxide for use as a fumigant and sterilizin g agent used to be available in 
mixtures with nitrogen, carbon dioxide or dichlorodifluor omethane. Mixtures of 8.5–80% 
ethylene oxide/91.5–20% carbon dioxide (Allied Sign al Chemicals, 1993) and 12% 
ethylene oxide in dichlorodifluoromethane were comm only used. As a result of concern 
about the role of chlorofluorocarbons in the deplet ion of stratospheric ozone and the 
phase-out of dichlorofluoromethane under the Montre al Protocol, the fluorocarbon 
materials now used to make blends of non-flammable ethylene oxide sterilants are 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons and ot her flame-retardant diluent gases 
(Dever et al ., 2004).

 1.1.5  Analysis 
Ethylene oxide in air can be determined by packed column ga s chromatography (GC) 
with an electron capture detector (ECD) (NIOSH Meth od 1614), with an estimated limit 
of detection of 1 µg ethylene oxide per sample (National Inst itute for Occupational Safety 
and Health, 1987). A similar method is reported by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration in the USA (Tucker & Arnold, 1984; C ummins et al ., 1987). In a similar 
method reported by the Canadian Research Institute for Health and Safety at Work 
(IRSST Method 81-2), the sample is absorbed on an a ctive charcoal tube (SKC ST-226-
36), desorbed by benzylic alcohol and analysed by G C/flame ionization detection (FID) 
(IRSST, 2005).  
In another technique (NIOSH Method 3702), a portabl e gas chromatograph is used 
with a photoionization detector or photoacoustic de tector (IRSST 39-A). The sample is 
either drawn directly into a syringe or collected a s a bag sample; it is then injected directly 
into the gas chromatograph for analysis. The estimat ed limit of detection of this method is 
2.5 pg/mL injection (0.001 ppm [0.002 mg/m 3]) (National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health, 1998).  
Passive methods use derivatization techniques that convert ethylene oxide to 
2-bromoethanol followed by GC/ECD analysis or colle ct ethylene oxide in acidic solution 
(in which it is converted to ethylene glycol) or on  a selective membrane followed by 
colorimetric analysis (Kring et al ., 1984; Puskar & Hecker, 1989; Puskar et al ., 1990, 
1991; Szopinski et al ., 1991). 
Methods for the analysis and quantification of ethy lene oxide in emissions from pro-
duction plants and commercial sterilizers by GC/FID  have been reviewed (Steger, 1989; 
Margeson et al ., 1990).  
Ethylene oxide has been measured in alveolar air an d blood (Brugnone et al ., 1986). 
Several methods have been reported for the determin ation of N-(2-hydroxyethyl) adducts 
with cysteine, valine and histidine in haemoglobin:  a radioimmunological technique, a 
modified Edman degradation procedure with GC/mass s pectrometry (MS), a GC method 
with selective ion monitoring MS and a GC/ECD metho d (Farmer et al ., 1986; Bailey et 
al ., 1987; Bolt et al ., 1988; Föst et al ., 1991; Hagmar et al. , 1991; Kautiainen & 
Törnqvist, 1991; Sarto et al ., 1991; van Sittert et al ., 1993; Schettgen et al ., 2002). 
Methods have been reported for the detection of res idues of ethylene oxide used as a 
sterilant: headspace GC (Marlowe et al ., 1987) and GC (Wojcik-O’Neill & Ello, 1991) 
for the analysis of medical devices; capillary GC f or the analysis of drugs and plastics 
(Danielson et al ., 1990); and headspace GC for the analysis of pack aging materials and 
ethylene oxide in ethoxylated surfactants and demul sifiers (Dahlgran & Shingleton, 
1987). Methods have also been developed for the det ermination of ethylene oxide resi-
dues in processed food products. In one such method , ethylene oxide is converted to 
ethylene iodohydrin and analysed by GC/ECD (Jensen,  1988). 188 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
Production of ethylene oxide began in 1914 by the c hlorohydrin process, the main 
method used until 1937, in which ethylene chlorohydrin is co nverted to ethylene oxide by 
reaction with calcium oxide. The production of ethy lene chlorohydrin resulted in the 
formation of two main organochlorine by-products, 1 ,2-dichloroethane and bis(2-
chloroethyl)ether (see IARC, 1999a). Ethylene chlor ohydrin was produced in either the 
same or a separate unit and was pumped over to the ethylene oxide production sector. The 
chlorohydrin process for the production of ethylene  oxide was inefficient, because most 
of the chlorine that was used was lost as calcium c hloride. Since 1931, that process has 
gradually been replaced by the direct vapour-phase oxidation process, in which ethylene 
is oxidized to ethylene oxide with air or oxygen an d a silver catalyst at 10–30 atm (1–
3 MPa) and 200–300 ºC (Dever et al ., 2004; Anon., 2005). 
In 2002, ethylene oxide was produced in more than 3 0 countries in Asia, Australia, 
Europe, the Middle East, North America and South Am erica with a production capacity 
per year of 16.3 million tonnes (Lacson, 2003). Wor ldwide consumption of ethylene 
oxide was 14.7 million tonnes in 2002 (Dever et al ., 2004) and 18 million tonnes in 2006 
(Devanney, 2007).  Table 1 shows the number of producers by region as well as the pro-
duction levels of ethylene oxide in 2004; approxima tely 17 million tonnes of ethylene 
oxide were produced worldwide. Production in Canada  increased from 625 000 tonnes in 
1996 (WHO, 2003) to 1 084 000 tonnes in 2004.  
1.2.2  Use 
Ethylene oxide is an important raw material used in  the manufacture of chemical 
derivatives that are the basis for major consumer g oods in virtually all industrialized 
countries. Figure 1 gives an overview of global ind ustry demand for ethylene oxide by 
application. More than half of the ethylene oxide p roduced worldwide is used in the 
manufacture of monoethylene glycol (Occupational Sa fety and Health Administration, 
2005; Devanney, 2007). The percentage of total ethy lene oxide that is used domestically 
to manufacture ethylene glycols varies widely betwe en regions: North America (66%), 
western Europe (43%), Japan (68%) and the Middle Ea st (99%) (Lacson, 2003). 
Other derivatives of ethylene oxide include: diethy lene glycol, which is used in the 
production of polyurethanes, polyesters, softeners (cork, glue, casein and paper), plasti-
cizers and solvents and in gas drying; triethylene glycol , which is used in the manufacture 
of lacquers, solvents, plasticizers and humectants (moisture-retaining agents) and in gas 
drying; poly(ethylene) glycols, which are reacted w ith other materials and used in 
cosmetics, ointments, pharmaceutical preparations, lubricants (finishing of textiles, 
ceramics), solvents (paints and drugs) and plastici zers (adhesives and printing inks); 
ethylene glycol ethers, which are frequently a comp onent of brake fluids, detergents and 
solvents (paints and lacquers) and are used to trea t natural and refinery gas; ethanolamines,  ETHYLENE OXIDE 189  
 
 which are used in textile finishing, cosmetics, soa ps, detergents and natural gas 
purification; and ethoxylation products of fatty al cohols, fatty amines, alkyl phenols, 
cellulose and poly(propylene) glycol, which are use d in the production of detergents and 
surfactants (non-ionic), biodegradable detergents, emulsifiers and dispersants (Occup-
ational Safety and Health Administration, 2005; Dev anney, 2007). 
A very small proportion (0.05%) of the annual produ ction of ethylene oxide is used 
directly in the gaseous form as a sterilizing agent , fumigant and insecticide, either alone or 
in non-explosive mixtures with nitrogen, carbon dioxi de or dichlorofluoromethane (Dever 
et al ., 2004).

Ethylene oxide is also used as a fumigant and steri lant for microbial organisms in a 
variety of applications. An estimated 9–10 million pounds [4–5 million tonnes] of ethyl-
ene oxide were used in 2002 to sterilize drugs, hos pital equipment, disposable and re-
usable medical items, packaging materials, foods, b ooks, museum artefacts, scientific 
equipment, clothing, furs, railcars, aircraft, beeh ives and other items (Lacson, 2003). 
1.3 Occurrence 
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
Ethylene oxide occurs endogenously as a metabolite of ethylene in certain plants and 
micro-organisms (see Section 4.1). Ethylene oxide c an be generated from water-logged 
soil, manure and sewage sludge, but emissions are e xpected to be negligible (WHO, 
2003).

 1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
Most of the data on occupational exposure are relat ed to the production of ethylene 
oxide and its use in industrial and hospital steril ization. 
Data were not available on exposures that are incur red outside North America and 
Europe, where almost half of the global amount of e thylene oxide is produced (Table 1). 
The National Occupational Exposure Survey conducted  by the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health in the USA between 1 981 and 1983 indicated that 
270 000 employees in the USA were potentially expos ed to ethylene oxide at work 
(NOES, 1993). This implies that, with an estimated labour f orce (aged 16 years and over) 
of 106 million (US Census, 1980), fewer than 0.3% o f employees was exposed. Of this 
number, 22% was estimated to be exposed to ethylene  oxide and 78% to materials that 
contain ethylene oxide. Workers in hospitals and in  the chemical and allied products 
industry (manufacture of plastics, synthetic material s and drugs) accounted for half of that 
number. 
More recent data on employment in the industrial se ctors that use ethylene oxide have 
been reported by the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (2005). 
Approximated employment figures were: ethylene oxid e production workers, 1100; 
ethoxylators (use of ethylene oxide to make derivat ives), 4000; and sterilant or fumigant 
use in hospitals, 40 000. In addition, approximatel y 2700 workers were employed in 
commercial sterilization by medical and pharmaceuti cal product manufacturers, in 
commercial sterilization by spice manufacturers, as  contract sterilizers and in other steri-
lization and fumigation facilities.  
The CAREX exposure information system (see General Remarks) includes estimates 
of the numbers of exposed workers in the 15 member states of the European Union in 
1990–93. The estimates were based on expert judgmen ts and did not involve exposure 
measurements. According to CAREX, 47 000 workers we re exposed to ethylene oxide, 
which is under 0.1% of the 139 million employed who  are covered by CAREX 
(Kauppinen et al. , 2000). The major industries in which exposure occ urred were medical, 
dental and other health and veterinary services (22  000 exposed) and the manufacture of 
industrial chemicals and other chemical products (7 000 exposed).  
The Finnish Register of occupational exposure to ca rcinogens reported that 126 
workers were notified as having been exposed to eth ylene oxide in 2004. This is below 
0.01% of the 2.4 million people employed in Finland . Most of the workers exposed were 
employed in medical occupations. The Register does not include any information on ex-
posure levels, and is based on annual notifications  of employers; its completeness is 
unknown (Saalo et al. , 2006).  
(a) Production of ethylene oxide and its derivatives  
Area samples taken in the 1960s throughout a plant in the USA where ethylene oxide 
was produced by direct oxidation of ethylene showed  concentrations of 0–55 ppm [0–192 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 100 mg/m 3]. On the basis of these results, the general long- term exposure of operators to 
ethylene oxide was estimated to be 5–10 ppm [9–18 m g/m 3] (Joyner, 1964). 
Area and personal samples were taken by the Nationa l Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health during 1977 and 1978 in five plan ts in the USA where ethylene oxide 
and its derivatives were produced. In most of the 9 5 personal samples taken, which were 
representative of whole shifts, the concentration o f ethylene oxide was below the 
detection limit (which varied from 0.1 to 8 mg/m 3); a few samples contained between 1 
and 148 mg/m 3. Similarly, in most area samples, the concentratio n was below the 
detection limit or was in the range < 1–1.5 ppm [2– 3 mg/m 3], apart from exceptional 
situations such as leaks (Lovegren & Koketsu, 1977a,b,c; Os er et al ., 1978a,b, 1979). The 
fact that full-shift concentrations in these plants  were usually well below the standards at 
that time (50 ppm [90 mg/m 3]) has been attributed to three main factors: the u se of 
completely closed systems for the storage, transfer  and production of ethylene oxide; the 
implementation of measures to prevent fire; and ope ration outdoors which resulted in 
dilution by natural air (Morgan et al ., 1981). 
Estimates of exposure to ethylene oxide were made f or a Swedish company where 
ethylene oxide and its derivatives were produced by  the chlorohydrin process. Average 
exposure was estimated to be less than 25 mg/m 3 during the period 1941–47 and 10–
50 mg/m 3 during the 1950s and early 1960s, with occasional peaks above the odour 
threshold of 1300 mg/m 3. After manufacture of ethylene oxide was stopped i n this 
company in 1963, exposure to 1–10 mg/m 3 (with occasional higher values) continued to 
occur because of its use in the manufacture of othe r compounds (Högstedt et al ., 1979a).  
At a plant in Germany where ethylene oxide was manu factured, 2-h area samples 
taken in 1978–79 contained less than 5 ppm [9 mg/m 3] under normal working conditions. 
Concentrations rose to 1900 ppm [3400 mg/m 3] for several minutes in exceptional cases 
during plant breakdown (Thiess et al. , 1981). 
The typical average daily exposures of workers in a 1979 surv ey of plants in the USA 
where ethylene oxide was manufactured and used were  0.3–4 ppm [0.5–7.3 mg/m 3]; 
worst-case peak exposures of maintenance workers were up  to 9600 ppm [17 300 mg/m 3] 
for less than 1 min (Flores, 1983). 
In one chemical manufacturing complex in the USA, y early time-weighted average 
(TWA) exposures to ethylene oxide in 1977–80 were r eported to have been below 1 ppm 
[1.8 mg/m 3] in all jobs except loading, during which technici ans were exposed to up to 
1.7 ppm [3 mg/m 3] yearly and 5.7 ppm [10 mg/m 3] individually. Peak exposures were 
usually < 20 ppm [< 36 mg/m 3], except in loading, during which concentrations o f up to 
235 ppm [420 mg/m 3] were reported (Currier et al ., 1984). 
In an ethylene oxide manufacturing plant in the Net herlands, geometric mean 
concentrations in 8-h personal samples were calcula ted to be < 0.01 ppm [< 0.02 mg/m3] 
in 1974, 1978 and 1980 and 0.12 ppm [0.2 mg/m 3] in 1981; individual values ranged from 
not detected (< 0.05 ppm [< 0.1 mg/m 3]) to 8 ppm [14 mg/m 3] (van Sittert et al ., 1985). 
At another plant in Sweden where ethylene oxide was  produced by oxygenation of 
ethylene, the 8-h TWA exposure to ethylene oxide wa s 9–15 mg/m 3 [5–8 ppm] in 1963– ETHYLENE OXIDE 193  
 
 76 and 2–4 mg/m 3 [1–2 ppm] in 1977–82 during the production of ethy lene oxide and 
ethylene glycol, 6 mg/m 3 [3 ppm] in 1963–76 and 2 mg/m 3 [1 ppm] in 1977–82 during 
the processing of ethylene oxide and 2–6 mg/m 3 [1–3 ppm] in 1963–76 and 1–3 mg/m 3 
[0.6–1.7 ppm] in 1977–82 during maintenance and tec hnical service work. Certain 
workers in each category were reported to have had higher exposures (up to 600–1800 
mg/m 3 [333–1000 ppm]) during periods of minutes (Högsted t et al ., 1986). 
In former Czechoslovakia, the 8-h TWA concentration s of ethylene oxide measured 
in 1982–84 in the working environment of an ethylen e oxide production plant were 0–
8.25 mg/m 3 [4.6 ppm] (Karelová et al ., 1987). 
Under the sponsorship of the Chemical Manufacturers ’ Association, company data 
were collected on current exposures to ethylene oxi de of workers in 11 ethylene oxide 
production units and 24 ethoxylation units in the U SA in 1987 (Table 2). Respirators were 
reported to be used in specific operations, such as  rail car loading and unloading, 
maintenance and product sampling, during which engi neering controls are not feasible 
(Heiden Associates, 1988a).

 5 ppm [9 mg/m 3] in almost all jobs and to < 1 ppm [1.8 mg/m 3] in many jobs; occasional 
peaks up to several hundred parts per million occurred as  a result of operating difficulties. 
In earlier years, peak exposures above the odour th reshold of 700 ppm [1260 mg/m 3] 
were reported.  
In industries in which ethylene oxide and its deriv atives are manufactured, exposure 
to a large variety of chemicals other than ethylene  oxide may occur, depending on the 
types of process and job. These include unsaturated aliphat ic hydrocarbons (e.g. ethylene, 
propylene; see IARC, 1994), other epoxides (e.g. pr opylene oxide; see IARC, 1994), 
chlorohydrins (e.g. epichlorohydrin; see IARC, 1999 a; and ethylene chlorohydrin), 
chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. dichlorome thane, dichloroethane; see IARC, 
1999a), glycols and ethers (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycol e thers, bis(2-chloroethyl)ether; see 
IARC, 1999a, 2006), aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde; s ee IARC, 2006), amines (e.g. 
aniline; see IARC, 1987), aromatic hydrocarbons (e. g. benzene, styrene; see IARC, 
1987), alkyl sulfates and other compounds (Shore et al ., 1993). 
(b) Use of ethylene oxide for industrial sterilization 
Industrial workers may be exposed to ethylene oxide  during sterilization of a variety 
of products such as medical equipment and products (e.g. surgical products, single-use 
medical devices), disposable health care products, pharmaceutical and veterinary 
products, spices and animal feed.  
In an extensive survey of the industry in the USA c onducted by the National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health, exposure to eth ylene oxide was estimated on the 
basis of data collected in 1976–85 by 21 of 36 comp anies, most of which were involved 
in the sterilization of medical supplies and spices . Individual 8-h TWA concentrations of 
samples collected by active sampling on charcoal tubes in th e personal breathing zones of 
workers were included in a model in which regressio n analysis was used to link exposure 
concentrations to seven significant variables: year  of operation, volume of sterilizer or 
treatment vessel, period since the product was steri lized, product type, aeration procedure, 
presence of a rear exhaust valve in the sterilizer and exposure category (sterilizer, 
chamber area, maintenance, production, warehouse, c lean room, quarantine and labo-
ratory) (Greife et al ., 1988; Stayner et al ., 1993; Hornung et al ., 1994). When the model 
was applied in a cohort study to the job histories of exposed workers in 13 of the 
companies surveyed, the estimated historical averag e concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 
77.2 ppm [0.1–139 mg/m 3], with a mean of 5.5 ppm [9.9 mg/m 3] and a median of 
3.2 ppm [5.8 mg/m 3] (Stayner et al ., 1993). Wong and Trent (1993) used the industrial  
hygiene data from the same companies and estimated that sterilizer operators were 
exposed to an 8-h TWA concentration of 16 ppm [29 m g/m 3] before 1978 and of 4–
5 ppm [7–9 mg/m 3] after 1978, while production workers were exposed  to about 5 ppm 
[9 mg/m 3] before 1978 and 2 ppm [3.6 mg/m 3] after that year.  
In a Swedish factory where hospital equipment was s terilized, area samples taken in 
1977 in the storage area showed concentrations of e thylene oxide that ranged from 2 to 
70 ppm [3.6–126 mg/m 3]; the 8-h TWA concentration in the breathing zone of worker s in  ETHYLENE OXIDE 195  
 
 the same area was 20 ppm [36 mg/m 3] (Högstedt et al ., 1979b). In 1978, full-shift 
personal sampling indicated that sterilizing room opera tors had an exposure concentration 
of 2.4 ppm [4.3 mg/m 3]; area sampling indicated an exposure of 1.3 ppm [ 2.3 mg/m 3]. 
Personal sampling showed a concentration of 0.1 ppm  [0.2 mg/m 3] in the packing room, 
and area sampling showed a concentration of 0.8 ppm  [1.4 mg/m 3] in the stockroom 
(Högstedt et al ., 1983). In another Swedish study, sterilization w orkers and a laboratory 
technician in the production of disposable medical equipment were reported to have been 
exposed to bursts of ethylene oxide at concentratio ns of 5–10 ppm [9–18 mg/m 3] for a 
total of 1 h per working day, while packers were ex posed at an average of 0.5–1 ppm [1–
2 mg/m 3] for the entire week (Pero et al ., 1981). Sterilization workers, packers and truck 
drivers at another Swedish factory, where single-us e medical equipment was produced, 
were reported to be exposed to an 8-h TWA concentra tion of 0.5–1 ppm [1–2 mg/m 3] 
(Pero et al ., 1982). In two Swedish disposable medical equipme nt plants, sterilizers and 
packers were the most heavily exposed, but levels d ecreased steadily from 35–40 ppm 
[about 70 mg/m 3] in 1970 to < 0.2–0.75 ppm [< 1.5 mg/m 3] in 1985; the average levels of 
exposure of store workers and development engineers  decreased from 5–20 ppm [9–
36 mg/m 3] to < 0.2 ppm [< 0.4 mg/m 3] in the same period, while those of people in othe r 
job categories (repairmen, laboratory technicians, controllers and foremen) decreased 
from 1–4 ppm [2–7 mg/m 3] to < 0.2 ppm [< 0.4 mg/m 3] (Hagmar et  al ., 1991).  
Engineering controls and new work practices designe d to lower the exposure of 
workers to ethylene oxide were generally adopted in  the USA in 1978 and 1979 
(Steenland et al ., 1991). Stolley et al . (1984) estimated that the 8-h TWA concentrations 
of sterilizer operators in three facilities in the USA before 1980 had been 0.5, 5–10 and 5–
20 ppm [1, 9–18 and 9–36 mg/m 3], while data collected in the two plants that were  still 
operating in 1980–82 indicated concentrations of le ss than 1 ppm [2 mg/m 3]. 
In Belgium, 12 workers involved in industrial steri lization in three plants were 
exposed to 8-h TWA concentrations of 0.1–9.3 ppm [0 .2–16.7 mg/m 3], with averages in 
each plant of 1.7, 3.7 and 4.5 ppm [3.1, 6.7 and 8. 1 mg/m 3] (Wolfs et al ., 1983). 
In a plant in eastern Germany where disposable medi cal equipment was sterilized, 
workers were found to have been exposed to an average conce ntration of about 60 mg/m 3 
[27.1 ppm] in 1985 and about 30 mg/m 3 [13.6 ppm] from 1989 onwards (Tates et al ., 
1991). 
Under the sponsorship of the Health Industry Manufa cturers’ Association, company 
data were collected in 1987 on current exposures to  ethylene oxide of workers in 71 
facilities in the USA where medical devices and dia gnostic products were sterilized. The 
workers included sterilizer operators, maintenance workers, supervisors, warehouse 
workers, laboratory workers and quality control per sonnel. Respirators were reported to 
be used in specific operations, such as unloading t he sterilizer, maintenance, quality 
control sampling, emergencies, loading aeration, an d changing ethylene oxide bottles, 
cylinders and tanks. Concentrations were measured o utside the respirators. The routine 
8-h TWA concentration that occurred 2 or more days per week was > 1 ppm 
[> 1.8 mg/m 3] for 12.6% of workers, 0.5–1 ppm [0.9–1.8 mg/m 3] for 13.9%, 0.3–0.5 ppm 196 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 [0.5–0.9 mg/m 3] for 26.7% and < 0.3 ppm [< 0.5 mg/m 3] for 46.8%. Short-term sampling 
(for 5–120 min; average, 28 min; except in one fact ory where sampling was for 210 min 
for workers in other jobs) showed routine short-ter m exposures of > 10 ppm [> 18 mg/m 3] 
for 10.7% of workers, 5–10 ppm [9–18 mg/m 3] for 17.1% and < 5 ppm [< 9 mg/m 3] for 
72.2%. Non-routine short-term exposure that occurre d 1 day per week or near areas 
where there was exposure was > 10 ppm [> 18 mg/m 3] for 5.1% of workers, 5–10 ppm 
[9–18 mg/m 3] for 2.6% and < 5 ppm [< 9 mg/m 3] for 92.3% (Heiden Associates, 1988b). 
At a commercial sterilization operation in the USA,  workers were exposed to 8-h 
TWA concentrations of 1–10 ppm [1.8–18 mg/m 3] in 1993–2001 and to 1.3–2.4 ppm 
[2.3–4.3 mg/m 3] in 2002, according to measurements carried out by  the employer. The 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration monit ored personal exposures in the 
same workplace and found 8-h TWA concentrations of 0.6–9.3 ppm [1.1–17 mg/m 3]. 
After improvement of working conditions, 8-h TWA concentra tions of 0.2–1.2 ppm [0.4–
2.2 mg/m 3] were found during follow-ups (Daniel et al ., 2004). 
Exposures in 10 factories in Taiwan (China) that us ed ethylene oxide as a sterilant in 
the manufacture of medical supplies were measured i n 2005 (Chien et al ., 2007). 
Sterilizer operators had an average short-term expo sure level of 27.6 ppm [50 mg/m 3] 
during unloading of the sterilizer, and the mean 8- h TWA exposure was 7.4 ppm 
[13 mg/m 3]. High concentrations were measured particularly i n the aeration area, near the 
sterilizer and in the warehouse. Increasing the num ber of post-sterilization purge cycles 
and improvements to ventilation in the aeration are a and warehouse decreased the average 
short-term exposures to 55% of the earlier values.  
Other substances to which workers involved in the s terilization of medical products 
may be exposed include gases that are present with ethylene oxide in the sterilizing 
mixture, such as chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dio xide (Heiden Associates, 1988b), and 
methyl formate in Sweden (Hagmar et al ., 1991). 
(c) Use of ethylene oxide in hospitals 
Ethylene oxide is used widely in hospitals as a gas eous sterilant for heat-sensitive 
medical items, surgical instruments and other objec ts and fluids that come into contact 
with biological tissues. The National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health 
estimated that there were more than 10 000 sterilizers in use in health care facilities in the 
USA in 1977. Large sterilizers are found in central  supply areas of most hospitals, and 
smaller sterilizers are found in clinics, operating  rooms, tissue banks and research 
facilities (Glaser, 1979).  
Exposure to ethylene oxide may result during any of  the following operations and 
conditions: changing pressurized ethylene oxide gas c ylinders; leaking valves, fittings and 
piping; leaking sterilizer door gaskets; opening th e sterilizer door at the end of a cycle; 
improper ventilation at the sterilizer door; improp erly ventilated or unventilated air gap 
between the discharge line and the sewer drain; rem oval of items from the sterilizer and 
transfer of the sterilized load to an aerator; impr oper ventilation of aerators and aeration 
areas; incomplete aeration of items; inadequate gene ral room ventilation; and passing near  ETHYLENE OXIDE 197  
 
 or working in the same room as sterilizers and aera tors during operation (Mortimer & 
Kercher, 1989).  
Levels of exposure to ethylene oxide in hospitals a re summarized in Table 3. 
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a series of 
studies between 1977 and 1990 to document the expos ure to ethylene oxide of hospital 
sterilization staff in the USA. The main results ar e summarized in Table 4. The more 
recent studies from Japan and France (see Table 3) suggest that 8-h TWA concentrations 
are often < 1 mg/m 3 [0.6 ppm] in hospitals. 
From 1984 to 2001, a total of 256 666 ethylene oxid e samples were analysed by a 
major vendor of passive ethylene oxide monitoring d evices in the USA. Most of the 
measurements (86%) were taken in hospitals. Workshi ft measurements were taken from 
28 373 hospital workers in 2265 hospitals and short -term measurements from 18 894 
workers in 1735 hospitals. The percentage of hospit als in which the 8-h TWA exposure 
limit of 1 ppm [1.8 mg/m 3] was exceeded once or more times in a year decreas ed from 
21% in 1988 to 0.9% in 2001 (La Montagne et al ., 2004). 
In most studies, exposure to ethylene oxide appears  to result mainly from peak 
emissions during operations such as opening the doo r of the sterilizer and unloading and 
transferring sterilized material. Proper engineerin g controls and work practices have been 
reported to result in full-shift exposure levels of  less than 0.1 ppm [0.18 mg/m 3] and 
short-term exposure levels of less than 2 ppm [3.6 mg/m 3] (Mortimer & Kercher, 1989). 
In a survey of 125 hospitals in the USA, however, u se of personal protective equipment 
was found to be limited to the wearing of various t ypes of gloves while transferring 
sterilized items. No respirators were used (Elliott  et al ., 1988). 
In a unit in Argentina that was equipped with old g as sterilizers with no mechanical 
ventilation, the 8-h TWA concentration of ethylene oxide was 60–69 ppm [108–
124 mg/m 3] (Lerda & Rizzi, 1992). 
Other substances to which sterilizer operators in h ospitals may be exposed include 
other gases present in the sterilizing mixture such  as chlorofluorocarbons (see IARC, 
1999a; banned by the Montreal Protocol in 1989) and  carbon dioxide (Wolfs et al ., 1983; 
Deschamps et al ., 1989). Some operating room personnel exposed to ethylene oxide may 
also be exposed to anaesthetic gases and X-rays (Sa rto et al ., 1984a; see IARC, 2000; 
Chessor et al ., 2005), and some may have occasional exposure to low concentrations of 
formaldehyde (Gardner et al ., 1989; see IARC, 2006). 
(d) Other uses 
In a wastewater treatment plant in the USA, ethylen e oxide was used as a reaction 
chemical to modify starch in the starch processing area; in this area, full-shift personal 
breathing zone concentrations ranged from undetecta ble to 0.43 mg/m3 [0.24 ppm] for 
operators and from undetectable to 2.5 mg/m 3 [1.4 ppm] for mechanics (McCammon et 
al ., 1990). 198 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 1.3.3  Environmental occurrence 
Most ethylene oxide is released into the atmosphere  (WHO, 2003). Ethylene oxide 
degrades in the atmosphere by reaction with photoche mically produced hydroxyl radicals. 
The half-life of ethylene oxide in the atmosphere, assuming ambient concentrations of 
5 × 10 5 hydroxy radicals/cm 3, is 211 days. Data suggest that neither rain nor a bsorption 
into aqueous aerosols remove ethylene oxide from th e atmosphere (National Library of 
Medicine, 2005). 
Releases of ethylene oxide (excluding sterilization ) into the environment in Canada 
totalled 23 tonnes in 1996. The industry sectors th at reported data were plastics and 
synthetics (0.24 tonnes), inorganic chemicals (6.1 tonnes), industrial organic chemicals 
(8.7 tonnes) and soap and cleaning compounds (8.0 t onnes) (WHO, 2003). An additional 
3.0 tonnes per year are estimated to be released fr om the servicing of medical facilities 
that use ethylene oxide in sterilization processes and commercial sterilization operations 
(WHO, 2003). By 1997, the emissions had been reduce d by 82% from the 1993 levels. 
Emissions of ethylene oxide reported to the Environ mental Protection Agency by 
industrial facilities in the USA declined from appr oximately 2900 tonnes in 1987 to 835 
tonnes in 1991 and 135.3 tonnes in 2005 (National L ibrary of Medicine, 2006). Ethylene 
oxide is one of the 33 hazardous urban air pollutan ts identified as those that pose the 
greatest threat to human health in the largest numb er of urban areas (Environmental 
Protection Agency, 2000). 
In California, USA, concentrations of ethylene oxid e in outdoor air were < 0.001–
0.96 mg/m 3 (128 samples) in Los Angeles, 0.032–0.40 µg/m 3 [0.018–0.22 ppb] 
(36 samples) in northern California and 0.03–0.36 µg/m 3 [0.017–0.20 ppb] in a remote 
coastal location (Havlicek et al ., 1992). 
Three of 50 24-h air samples collected outside rand omly selected residences in 
Alberta, Ontario and Nova Scotia in Canada containe d 3.7–4.9 µg/m 3 ethylene oxide. 
Ethylene oxide was detected in only one sample (4 µg/m 3) taken inside these 50 resi-
dences. The limit of detection was 0.19 µg/m 3 (WHO, 2003).  
1.3.4   Other occurrence 
Food products, including herbs, spices, nuts, cocoa  beans, cocoa, cocoa cake, raisins, 
dried vegetables and gums, were often treated with ethylene oxide in the 1980s. Of 204 
food products from retail shops in Denmark that wer e examined for ethylene oxide 
residues in 1985, 96 samples were found to have con centrations of ethylene oxide that 
ranged from 0.05 to 1800 mg/kg. The food products s urveyed included herbs and spices 
(14–580 mg/kg), dairy products (0.06–4.2 mg/kg), pi ckled fish (0.08–2.0 mg/kg), meat 
(0.05–20 mg/kg), cocoa products (0.06–0.98 mg/kg) a nd black and herb teas (3–5 mg/kg; 
one sample contained 1800 mg/kg). In a follow-up su rvey of 59 honey samples, no 
ethylene oxide residue was detected (Jensen, 1988).  
A total of 200 samples of spices that are known to be consumed commonly without 
cooking (e.g. pepper, cinnamon/cassia, chilli, curr y powder and paprika) were taken from  ETHYLENE OXIDE 203  
 
 wholesalers and retailers in New Zealand in 1999. O nly two samples of cinnamon 
contained detectable amounts (limit of detection, 2  mg/kg) of ethylene oxide (6 and 
15 mg/kg). Ethylene oxide intake, based on average spice consumption in New Zealand, 
was estimated to be 0.21 µg per person per day (conservative estimate) (Fowle s et al ., 
2001). 
Ethylene oxide occurs as a contaminant of skin care  products because current 
commercial preparations of polyglycol ethers may co ntain ethylene oxide monomer 
residues of up to 1 ppm (Filser et al ., 1994). This is in line with a study in which skin  care 
products were reported to contain 0.08–1.5 mg/L eth ylene oxide (Kreuzer, 1992). 
Ethylene oxide is formed during the combustion of f ossil fuel, but the amount is 
expected to be negligible (WHO, 2003).  
Mainstream tobacco smoke contains 7 µg/cigarette ethylene oxide (IARC, 2004). 
Patients may be exposed during dialysis when the eq uipment has been sterilized with 
ethylene oxide (IPCS-CEC, 2001). 
1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
Occupational exposure limits and guidelines for eth ylene oxide in a number of 
countries, regions or organizations are presented i n Table 5. 
A tolerance of 50 ppm (mg/kg) has been established in the USA for residues of 
ethylene oxide when used as a post-harvest fumigant  in or on raw black walnut meats, 
copra and whole spices (Environmental Protection Ag ency, 1992a). Ethylene oxide, 
either alone or with carbon dioxide or dichlorodifl uoromethane, is permitted in the USA 
as a fumigant for the control of micro-organisms an d insect infestation in ground spices 
and other processed natural seasoning materials, ex cept mixtures to which salt has been 
added. Residues of ethylene oxide in ground spices must not exceed the established 
tolerance of 50 ppm (mg/kg) in whole spices (Enviro nmental Protection Agency, 1992b).

 2.     Studies of Cancer in Humans 
The main findings of epidemiological studies of eth ylene oxide and cancer risk are 
summarized in Table 6. 
2.1 Case reports 
Högstedt et al . (1979b) reported three cases of haematopoietic ne oplasms that had 
occurred between 1972 and 1977 in workers at a Swed ish factory where ethylene oxide 
and methyl formate had been used since 1968 to ster ilize hospital equipment. Attention 
had been drawn to the case cluster by the factory s afety committee. One woman with 
chronic myeloid leukaemia and another with acute my elogenous leukaemia had worked 
in a storage hall where they were exposed for 8 h p er day to an estimated 20 ± 10 
(standard deviation [SD]) ppm [36 ± 18 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide. The third case was that of 
a man with primary Waldenström macroglobulinaemia w ho had been manager of the 
plant since 1965 and had been exposed to ethylene o xide for an estimated 3 h per week. 
[The Working Group noted that Waldenström macroglob ulinaemia is classified in the 
WHO Classification of Diseases as lymphoplasmocytic  lymphoma.] 
Tompa et al.  (1999) described a cluster of 16 cases of cancer ( including eight women 
with breast cancer) over a 12-year period among 98 nurses who  were exposed to ethylene 
oxide at a sterilizer unit in a hospital in Hungary . Airborne concentrations of ethylene 
oxide in the working area were reported to vary fro m 5 to 150 mg/m 3. 
2.2 Cohort studies 
2.2.1  Europe 
Högstedt et al . (1979a, 1986) and Högstedt (1988) examined worker s at a Swedish 
chemical plant where ethylene oxide had been produced by th e chlorohydrin process. The 
cohort comprised men who had taken part in a medica l survey in 1959–61 and included 
89 operators with regular exposure to ethylene oxid e, 78 maintenance staff with inter-
mittent exposure and 66 unexposed men. All of the m en had been exposed or employed 
for at least 1 year. Average exposures to ethylene oxide during 1941–47 were estimated to 
have been below 25 mg/m 3, but occasional peaks exceeded the odour threshold  of 1300 
mg/m 3. During the 1950s and through to 1963, an average concentration of 10–50 mg/m 3 
was estimated. In 1963, production of ethylene oxide  ceased, but the compound continued 
to be used in manufacturing processes, and random s amples showed workplace 
concentrations of ethylene oxide in the range of 1– 10 mg/m 3, with occasional higher 
values. Other exposures in the plant included chlor oform (IARC, 1999b), chlorinated 
acetals, chloral (IARC, 1995), DDT (IARC, 1991), et hylene glycol, surfactants, cellulose 
ethers, ethylene (IARC, 1994), ethylene chlorohydri n, ethylene dichloride, bis(2-
chlorethyl)ether (IARC, 1987, 1999a) and propylene o xide (IARC, 1994, 1995, 1997). 206 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 The cohort was followed from 1962 to 1985 through n ational registries. Among the 
ethylene oxide operators, 34 deaths from all causes  occurred (25.0 expected), including 
14 cancer deaths (6.1 expected) of which five were due to stomach cancer (0.6 expected) 
and two to leukaemia (0.2 expected; one chronic mye logenous and one acute leukaemia 
not further specified). No overall excess mortality  from cancer was observed among the 
maintenance staff who had intermittent exposure or among the unexposed workers; 
however, four of the maintenance men had died from stomach cancer (0.6 expected) and 
one from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (0.2 expecte d).  
Two hundred and three workers employed for at least  1 year at the Swedish factory 
described in Section 2.1 were subsequently followed  up for mortality through national 
census, death and emigration registries (Högstedt et al ., 1986). During 1978–82, five 
deaths occurred (4.9 expected), four of which were from cancer (1.6 expected). Two of 
the deaths were from lymphatic and haematopoietic m alignancies (0.13 expected), but 
one of these decedents (who had acute myelogenous l eukaemia) had been part of the 
original case cluster that had prompted the study. The other died from acute blastic 
leukaemia. 
The above reports also described a third cohort of Swedish workers who were 
exposed to ethylene oxide in a plant where the comp ound was produced by direct 
oxidation of ethylene (Högstedt et al ., 1986; Högstedt, 1988). The cohort comprised 128 
workers who were employed in the production of ethy lene oxide or ethylene glycol and 
had had almost pure exposure to ethylene oxide; 69 workers who were employed in the 
processing of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide to  non-ionic surfactants and polyols 
and whose principal exposure was to ethylene oxide and propylene oxide but who had 
also been exposed to various amines, sodium nitrate (IARC, 2 009), formaldehyde (IARC, 
2006) and 1,2-butene oxide; and 158 maintenance and  technical personnel who had had 
multiple exposures that included ethylene oxide. An alyses of air samples and interviews 
with experienced staff indicated 8-h TWA exposures to ethylene oxide of 1–8 ppm [1.8–
14.4 mg/m 3] during 1963–76, which fell to 0.4–2.0 ppm [0.7–3. 6 mg/m 3] during 1977–
82. Expected numbers of cancers and deaths were cal culated from 5-year age-, sex- and 
calendar year-specific rates for the national popul ation. During follow-up from 1964 to 
1981 using national registries, eight deaths were o bserved in the entire cohort compared 
with 11.6 expected; one man in the maintenance and repair group died from chronic 
myelogenous leukaemia. During extended follow-up to  1985, a fatal case of reticular-cell 
sarcoma was recorded among the production workers [ expected number not given]. [The 
Working Group noted that the cohort was not defined  precisely.] 
Högstedt (1988) also presented findings on cancer i ncidence (ascertained through the 
national cancer registry) for the three cohort stud ies described above. After exclusion of 
the three cases in the initial cluster at the steri lizing plant, seven leukaemias were 
observed (0.8 expected from national rates [standar dized incidence ratio (SIR), 9.2]). For 
blood and lymphatic malignancies, nine deaths were observed (two expected; 
standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 4.59). Confiden ce intervals (CIs) were reported only 
for the SMRs of men. 226 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 Thiess et al . (1981) examined the mortality of 602 active and former ma le 
employees at a company in western Germany who had worked for at least 6 months in 
an area of alkylene oxide production. Until 1965, ethylene oxide had been made from 
ethylene chlorohydrin, but thereafter it was produced by di rect oxidation of ethylene. 
Propylene oxide had been made since 1959 by a propylene chloro hydrin process. 
Industrial hygiene measurements in 1978 showed that the avera ge concentration of 
ethylene oxide was < 4 ppm [7.2 mg/m 3], but no earlier measurement was available. 
Discussions with long-standing employees indicated that exp osures before that time 
would have been higher. Other potential exposures included propyl ene oxide, butylene 
oxide, dioxane, epichlorohydrin, dichloropropane, ethylene chlor ohydrin, propylene 
chlorohydrin, aniline, piperazine, cyclohexylamine, cycloh exane, formaldehyde, 
isobutyraldehyde, ethyleneimine, hydrocyanic acid, hydrogen sulfi de, aluminium 
chloride, benzene, phenol, cyanuric acid, acrylic acid and acetylene alcohols (IARC, 
1987, 1994, 1999a, 2006). The first worker was employed in 1928, an d follow-up was 
from that year until 30 June 1980. The expected numbers of death s in the cohort were 
calculated for each 5-year age group, using mortality rat es for the populations of 
Ludwigshafen and Rhinehessia-Palatinate during 1970–75 and of Ge rmany during 
1971–74 as a reference. In addition, an internal comparison gr oup of 1662 persons 
who were employed in a styrene production facility on the s ame site was used. During 
follow-up, 56 deaths were recorded in the exposed cohort, wherea s the expected num-
bers were 71.5 (Ludwigshafen), 73.4 (Rhinehessia-Palatinate), 76.6 (Germany) and 
57.9 (styrene cohort). Fourteen of the deaths were due to c ancer, whereas 16.6 were 
expected from national statistics [SMR, 0.84]. The deaths fr om cancer included one 
case of myeloid leukaemia (< 0.15 expected) and one case of lym phatic sarcoma. [The 
Working Group noted that no indication of the completeness wi th which the cohort 
was identified was given, and that the methods of follow-up w ere not stated. It is not 
clear how losses to follow-up were handled in the analysis.]  
Gardner et al . (1989) studied 2876 workers at four British chemical com panies where 
ethylene oxide or its derivatives had been manufact ured and in eight hospitals where 
ethylene oxide had been used as a sterilant. In one  company, ethylene oxide had been 
produced by the chlorohydrin process during 1950–60 and by d irect oxidation of ethylene 
from 1959 onwards; in the second company, the chlor ohydrin process had been used 
during 1955–70 and direct oxidation was used therea fter; in the third company, ethylene 
oxide had been produced during 1960–81 only by dire ct oxidation; and in the fourth 
company, ethylene oxide had been used in the manufac ture of derivatives since 1959. The 
eight hospitals had started using ethylene oxide be tween 1962 and 1972. The cohort 
comprised all workers at each factory and hospital who had had probable exposure to 
ethylene oxide during specified periods for which e mployment records were complete. 
Sixteen subjects had to be excluded because such in formation was not available in full. 
Jobs held by cohort members at the factories were c lassified as having involved definite, 
probable or possible exposure to ethylene oxide. At  the hospitals, jobs were classed as 
involving continual, intermittent or possible expos ure. Environmental and personal moni- ETHYLENE OXIDE 227  
 
 toring since 1977 had shown a TWA concentration of < 5 ppm [9 mg/m 3] in almost all 
jobs, but with occasional peaks of exposure up to s everal hundred parts per million as a 
result of operating difficulties in the chemical pl ants and during loading and unloading of 
sterilizers in the hospitals. Exposures were though t to have been higher in earlier years, 
and peak exposures above the odour threshold of 700  ppm [1260 mg/m 3] were reported 
both by the chemical manufacturers and at the hospitals.  Cohort members at the manufac-
turing plants were potentially exposed to many othe r chemicals, including chlorohydrin, 
propylene oxide, styrene and benzene; some of the h ospital workers had occasionally 
been exposed to formaldehyde and carbon tetrachlori de. The cohort was followed for 
mortality through the National Health Service Centr al Register, with supplementary infor-
mation from social security records for some subjec ts. In the most recently published 
analysis of this study (Coggon et al. , 2004), the results of which subsumed earlier 
findings, the cohort was followed for mortality to 2000. Follow-up for 51 untraced 
subjects was cut off at the last known date of empl oyment. A further 206 subjects had 
emigrated or were otherwise lost to follow-up, and were considered to be at risk up to the 
date when they were last known to be alive. Observe d mortality was compared with that 
expected from national death rates by sex, age and calendar period. No significant 
elevations of mortality were observed for any categ ory of cancer either in the cohort as a 
whole, or separately in the chemical manufacturers and hospital workers. Among the 
1471 chemical workers (all but one of whom were men ), 366 deaths (366.9 expected) 
occurred from all causes, including 120 (108.6 expe cted; SMR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.92–1.32) 
from all cancers combined. Increased non-significan t risks were found for leukaemia, 
lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Lymphatic and haemat opoietic cancer was more 
common in chemical workers who were classed as havi ng had definite exposure to 
ethylene oxide (nine deaths versus 4.9 expected; SM R, 1.84), but there was no excess in 
the hospital workers who were classed as continuall y exposed (one death versus 2.6 
expected). 
Most of the above cohort was included in a larger s tudy of employees from six 
chemical companies in western Germany (Kiesselbach et al ., 1990). The 2658 cohort 
members had been exposed to ethylene oxide for at l east 12 months before 31 December 
1982. The year of first exposure ranged from 1928 t o 1981, but most had first been 
exposed after 1950. Other possible exposures includ ed benzene (IARC, 1987), 
4-aminobiphenyl and 2-naphthylamine (IARC, 1987), b ut no information was given on 
the extent of exposure to these substances. Subjects  who had left employment were traced 
through local registries and, in the case of foreig ners who had returned home, by letter or 
by asking fellow countrymen who were still working in the plant. Of the cohort members, 
97.6% were traced successfully to 31 December 1982.  For those who had died, the cause 
of death was ascertained from death certificates (2 7.6% of all deaths), lay statements, the 
physician who last treated the patient or hospital reports. Mortality was compared with 
that expected from 5-year age-, sex- and calendar p eriod-specific rates in the national 
population; no statistics were available for period s before 1951, and the rates for 1951 
were used. In total, 268 deaths were observed, wher eas 307.6 were expected. There were 228 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 68 deaths from cancer (69.9 expected; SMR, 0.97; 95 % CI, 0.76–1.24), including three 
from oesophageal cancer (1.5 expected), 14 from sto mach cancer (10.2 expected; SMR, 
1.38; 95% CI, 0.75–2.31) and five from lymphatic an d haematopoietic cancer (5.0 
expected; SMR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.32–2.34). Two deaths  were ascribed to leukaemia (2.4 
expected). When expected numbers were calculated on  the basis of rates in the states in 
which each plant was situated, the findings were ve ry similar. Based on calculations in 
which the first 10 years of exposure for each subje ct were ignored, mortality ratios were 
similar to those in the main analysis. It was possib le to classify exposure to ethylene oxide 
for 67.2% of subjects as ‘weak’, ‘medium’ or ‘high’ . The excess mortality from stomach 
cancer was greatest in those with weak or medium ex posure and with less than 15 years 
of total exposure. When foreign workers were exclud ed from the analysis, there was no 
change in the observed number of deaths and mortali ty ratios were only slightly 
increased. [The Working Group noted that the full e ligibility criteria for inclusion in the 
cohort were not reported, no data were given on pro bable levels of exposure to ethylene 
oxide or on the nature of the processes in which su bjects worked, and risk estimates may 
have been seriously biased since certificates were available for only about one-quarter of 
deaths in the cohort.] 
Hagmar et al . (1991) studied employees at two Swedish plants th at produced 
disposable medical equipment that was sterilized wi th ethylene oxide. In plant A, a 50:50 
mixture of ethylene oxide and methyl formate had be en used since 1970. In 1973, 
personal sampling for two packers indicated an expo sure to ethylene oxide of 24 ppm 
[43 mg/m 3]. After 1981, monitoring was carried out annually over 1–3 days for sterilizers 
and packers and showed a continuous decrease in exp osure such that, after 1985, only 
sterilizers were exposed to concentrations greater tha n 0.2 ppm [0.4 mg/m 3] (the limit of 
detection of the method used). In plant B, a 50:50 mixture o f ethylene oxide and methyl 
formate was used from 1964 but was replaced by an et hylene oxide:carbon dioxide 
mixture in 1978. In 1975, personal monitoring indica ted exposures of 4–5 ppm [7–
9 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide for four packers. After 1985, the 8-h TWA concentration was 
< 0.2 ppm [0.4 mg/m 3] for all employees except sterilizers and store wor kers. The 
authors estimated that sterilizers were exposed to up to 75 ppm [135 mg/m 3] in the 
earliest years of operation at this plant. On the b asis of estimates of exposure in 
different job categories and time periods, the auth ors calculated individual cumulative 
exposures for 97% of subjects at plant A and 89% at plant B. The  cohort comprised 594 
men and 557 women who had been employed at plant A for at least 12 m onths between 
1970 and 1985 and who were still working after 1 Ju ne 1975, and 267 men and 752 
women who had been employed at plant B for at least 1 2 months between 1964 and 
1985 and were still working after 1 January 1972. T hese subjects were followed 
through to 1986 for mortality and from 1972 to 1985 for cancer registration. None was 
lost to follow-up. Expected mortality was calculated  on the basis of calendar year-, sex- 
and 5-year age-specific rates (cut-off at age 80 ye ars) for the county in which the plants 
were located, and expected cancer incidence was cal culated from corresponding 
registration rates in the same area. Fifteen deaths  were observed (25.7 expected),  ETHYLENE OXIDE 229  
 
 including eight from cancer (9.0 expected), two from  gastrointestinal cancer (2.1 
expected) and one from haematopoietic and lymphatic cancer (1.0 expected). The 
observed/expected numbers of incident cancers were 21/26.8 for cancers at any site, 
0/0.5 for stomach cancer, 1/1.6 for brain cancer, 2 /1.3 for lymphoma and myeloma and 
one case of polycythaemia vera with 0.7 cases of le ukaemia, polycythaemia vera and 
myelofibrosis expected. Among subjects with more tha n 1 ppm–year of cumulative 
exposure to ethylene oxide, two cases of cancer (3. 3 expected) and no lymphatic or 
haematopoietic cancer (0.2 expected) were observed.  Follow-up for cancer incidence 
was subsequently extended to 1990, again with no lo sses to follow-up (Hagmar et al ., 
1995). In total, 40 cases of cancer were recorded w ith 46.28 expected. No significant 
excesses in mortality were observed for any individ ual site of cancer, either with or 
without allowance for a 10-year induction period fr om first exposure. With no allowance 
for an induction period, the numbers of observed/ex pected cases were 5/10.8 (SIR, 0.5; 
95% CI, 0.15–1.08) for cancer of the breast, 6/3.37  (SIR, 1.78; 95% CI, 0.65–3.88) for 
lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer and 2/0.82 (SIR , 2.44; 95% CI, 0.30–8.81) for 
leukaemia. Among 930 subjects with cumulative expos ures of at least 0.14 ppm–years, 
after allowance for a minimum induction period of 10 years, t wo cases of leukaemia were 
observed compared with 0.28 expected (SIR, 7.1; 95%  CI, 0.87–25.8). 
Bisanti et al . (1993) studied a cohort that comprised all 1971 m ale chemical workers 
in the Lombardy and Piedmont regions of Italy who had held a  licence to handle ethylene 
oxide for at least 1 year during 1938–84; 637 had h eld licences for ethylene oxide only 
and 1334 for ethylene oxide and other toxic gases. Som e workers may have been exposed 
to ethylene oxide before they obtained a licence. The cohort  was followed from 1 January 
1940 to 31 May 1984, and vital status was ascertain ed at the census office at the place of 
residence of each subject. Sixteen subjects (0.8%) who were lost to follow-up were 
considered to be still alive. Expected numbers of d eaths were calculated from 5-year age-, 
sex- and calendar period-specific rates for the reg ional (Lombardy) population. Seventy-
six deaths were recorded (98.8 expected), including  43 from cancer (33.0 expected). The 
SMRs were 1.22 (95% CI, 0.40–2.87) for stomach canc er, 2.54 (95% CI, 0.52–7.44) for 
cancer of the pancreas, 1.61 (95% CI, 0.04–8.95) fo r cancer of the kidney, 6.82 (95% CI, 
1.86–17.45) for lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma a nd 1.93 (95% CI, 0.23–6.99) for 
leukaemia. The two deaths from leukaemia occurred a mong men who had had less than 
5 years of exposure and after a latency of less tha n 10 years since first exposure to 
ethylene oxide. Among the men who had held licences only  for ethylene oxide, 27 deaths 
(30.1 expected) occurred (SMR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.57–1.27), 15  of which were from cancer 
(10.5 expected; SMR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.79–2.34), incl uding one from stomach cancer (1.3 
expected; SMR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.02–4.26), three from  lymphosarcoma and reticulo-
sarcoma (0.2 expected; SMR, 16.93; 95% CI, 3.49–49. 53) and two from leukaemia (0.3 
expected; SMR, 6.50; 95% CI, 0.79–23.49). Results o btained from national mortality 
rates as the basis for expected numbers were simila r. [The Working Group noted that no 
data were available on levels of exposure to ethyle ne oxide or on exposure to other 
chemicals.] 230 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 Following the observation of a cluster of breast ca ncer cases at a hospital in Hungary 
(Tompa et al ., 1999; see Section 2.1), Kardos et al . (2003) systematically followed 299 
women who were employed on a ward where an ethylene oxide sterilizer was used during 
1976–93. The cohort was followed from 1987 to 1999,  and deaths among cohort 
members were ascertained from various databases, wi th personal contact to confirm the 
vital status of those who did not appear in any of these records. A total of 11 deaths from 
cancer were identified (three breast, two ovary, tw o lung and one each of  large bowel, 
uterus, leukaemia and peritoneum) compared with 4.3 8 expected from national age- and 
calendar period-specific rates (SMR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.25–4.49). Expected numbers based 
on local mortality rates were similar. [The Working  Group noted that deaths in the cohort 
were ascertained from a different source from the r eference rates. Also, it was unclear 
whether any of the cases from the original cluster were included in the study.] 
Prompted by a perceived excess of cancer among pest -control officers of a large 
French city, Ambroise et al . (2005) conducted a historical cohort study of 181  men who 
had worked in the pest control department during 19 79–84. The cohort was followed for 
mortality up to 2000 through registry offices of bi rthplaces and records held by the Institut 
National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economique s; causes of death were obtained by 
matching with a national file of death certificates  or from records held by the personnel 
department (three cases). For three subjects who di ed abroad, vital status was established 
by interview with colleagues. Ethylene oxide had be en used to sterilize hospital equip-
ment, but no exposure measurements were reported. I ndividual exposures to ethylene 
oxide were assigned by application of a job–exposur e matrix to occupational histories 
abstracted from administrative records. At least 14 0 subjects were classed as having 
worked with ethylene oxide. In the cohort as a whole, 39 de aths from all causes occurred, 
including 21 from cancer (9.36 expected from region al sex- and age-specific rates by 
calendar year). However, no statistically significa nt excess of mortality was observed for 
any specific site of cancer and no consistent trend  of cancer mortality was observed in 
relation to estimated cumulative exposures to ethyl ene oxide. [The Working Group noted 
that less weight can be given to the overall excess  of cancer in this study, since the 
investigation was prompted by a perceived excess of  tumours.]  
2.2.2  USA 
Morgan et al . (1981) reported a retrospective cohort study of 7 67 men who had been 
employed between 1955 and 1977 at a chemical plant in eastern Texas where ethylene 
oxide was produced. All of the men had worked at th e factory for at least 5 years and 
were ‘potentially exposed’ to the compound. Potenti al exposure to ethylene oxide was 
determined by personnel at the company on the basis  of work histories. In an industrial 
hygiene survey in 1977, all samples taken in the pr oduction area contained less than 
10 ppm [18 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide. Vital status was ascertained for more than  95% of the 
cohort members from a combination of plant records,  ‘personal knowledge’ and tele-
phone follow-up. Altogether, 46 deaths were recorde d, whereas 80 were expected on the  ETHYLENE OXIDE 231  
 
 basis of US vital statistics. Death certificates we re obtained for 42 of the 46 deceased 
subjects. Eleven deaths were from cancer (15.2 expe cted), and non-significant excesses 
were found for mortality from cancers of the pancre as (three versus 0.8 expected) and 
brain and central nervous system (two versus 0.7 ex pected) and from Hodgkin disease 
(two versus 0.4 expected); no deaths from leukaemia  occurred. [The Working Group 
noted that details on the nature of the manufacturi ng process, the extent to which exposure 
readings were representative of earlier conditions in the plant and potential confounding 
exposures were lacking.] The results of an extended  follow-up of this cohort to 1985 
(follow-up rate, 99.7%) were reported by Shore et al . (1993) as part of a meta-analysis of 
cohort studies on ethylene oxide. Three deaths from  brain cancer (1.1 expected), three 
from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer (3.0 expec ted), none from leukaemia (1.1 
expected) and none from stomach cancer [expected nu mber not given] were observed. 
A series of studies was carried out on a cohort of 2174 male employees at two 
chemical plants in West Virginia where ethylene oxi de had been produced and used 
(Greenberg et al ., 1990; Benson & Teta, 1993; Teta et al ., 1993). It was produced by the 
chlorohydrin process during 1925–57 and by direct o xidation from 1937 to 1971. After 
1971, the plants continued to use ethylene oxide th at had been produced elsewhere. The 
cohort comprised men who had been employed at the pla nts during 1940–78 and assigned 
at any time before 1979 to a chemical production de partment in which ethylene oxide was 
judged to have been manufactured or used at the tim e of the assignment. The first large-
scale environmental monitoring project at the plant began in 1976. The 8-h TWA concen-
tration of ethylene oxide in departments where it w as used was generally less than 1 ppm 
[1.8 mg/m 3] but ranged up to 66 ppm [120 mg/m 3]. The authors estimated that the 8-h 
TWA concentration in ethylene oxide production by d irect oxidation in the 1960s ranged 
from 3 to 20 ppm [5.4–36 mg/m 3] and that exposures during production by the chlor o-
hydrin process were probably higher. Departments we re classified as having high, 
medium or low exposure concentrations according to the operations carried out, and the 
classification was validated by reference to report ed incidents of acute exposure. The 
cohort was followed to the end of 1988, and vital s tatus was ascertained for more than 
98% of subjects. Death certificates were obtained f or 99% of decedents, and expected 
numbers of deaths were calculated on the basis of n ational 5-year age- and calendar 
period-specific rates in white men.  
A total of 278 men had worked in a chlorohydrin uni t that primarily produced 
ethylene chlorohydrin, with ethylene dichloride and  bischloroethyl ether as by-products 
(Benson & Teta, 1993). For part of the time, propyl ene chlorohydrin had also been 
produced. Ethylene oxide was handled only sporadica lly and in small volumes. Of these 
men, 147 had died while 140.8 deaths were expected.  The deaths included 40 from cancer 
(30.8 expected; SMR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.9–1.8), eight from lymphatic and haematopoietic 
cancer (2.7 expected; SMR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3–5.8) an d eight from pancreatic cancer (1.6 
expected; SMR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.6–11.4). In a compari son with workers from other plants 
in the same locality, the risks for cancer of all t ypes, for lymphatic and haematopoietic 232 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 cancer, leukaemia and pancreatic cancer increased w ith duration of assignment to the 
chlorohydrin unit.  
Among the 1896 men who had never been assigned to t he chlorohydrin unit, 431 
deaths occurred whereas 547.7 were expected (Teta et al ., 1993). The numbers of 
observed/expected deaths were 110/128.1 (SMR, 0.86;  95% CI, 0.7–1.0) for cancer at any 
site, 8/5.0 (SMR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.7–3.2) for stomach  cancer, 4/6.6 (SMR, 0.6; 95% CI, 
0.2–1.6) for pancreatic cancer, 6/4.0 (SMR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.6–3.3) for cancers of the brain 
and nervous system, 7/11.8 (SMR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.2–1 .2) for lymphatic and haemato-
poietic cancer, 2/2.0 for lymphosarcoma and reticul osarcoma (International Classification 
of Diseases [ICD]-9 200), 5/4.7 (SMR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4–2.5) for leukaemia and aleu-
kaemia and 0/1.2 for Hodgkin disease. No significan t excess of mortality was observed 
for any cause of death. No excesses of mortality fr om leukaemia or stomach cancer were 
observed among men who had spent 2 or more years in  high-exposure departments. 
Comparison with death rates of workers from plants in the same location who had never 
been assigned to ethylene oxide production or use s howed no significant trend with 
duration of assignment for all cancers, leukaemia o r pancreatic, brain or stomach cancers; 
however, a two- to threefold increase in the risk f or leukaemia (based on three cases) was 
observed among workers with more than 10 years of a ssignment to ethylene oxide 
departments. This study confirmed and amplified the  findings of an earlier case–control 
study at the same plants (Ott et al ., 1989). 
Steenland et al . (1991) followed 18 254 employees at 14 industrial  plants where 
ethylene oxide had been used to sterilize medical s upplies or spices or in the testing of 
sterilizing equipment. The plants were selected bec ause they held adequate records on 
personnel and exposure and their workers had accumu lated at least 400 person–years at 
risk before 1978. Only workers with at least 3 months of e xposure to ethylene oxide were 
included in the cohort. Forty-five per cent of the cohort were men, 79% were white, 1222 
were sterilizer operators and 15 750 were employed before 1978. Analysis of 627 per-
sonal 8-h TWA samples indicated that average exposu re during 1976–85 was 4.3 ppm 
[7.7 mg/m 3] for sterilizer operators; on the basis of 1888 pe rsonal samples, the average 
level for other exposed workers was 2.0 ppm [3.6 mg /m 3]. Many companies began to 
install engineering controls in 1978, and exposures  before that year were thought to have 
been higher. There was no evidence of potentially c onfounding exposure to other 
occupational carcinogens. The cohort was followed up to 19 87 through the national death 
index and records of the Social Security Administra tion, the Internal Revenue Service and 
the US Postal Service; 95.5% were traced successful ly. The expected numbers of deaths 
were calculated from rates in the US population, st ratified according to age, race, sex and 
calendar year. In total, 1177 cohort members had died (1454.3 expected), including 40 for 
whom no death certificate was available. There were  343 deaths from cancer (380.3 
expected; SMR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8–1.0). The observed/ expected numbers of deaths were 
36/33.8 (SMR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.7–1.5) for all lympha tic and haematopoietic cancer, 
including 8/5.3 (SMR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.7–3.0) for lym phosarcoma-reticulosarcoma 
[ICD-9 200], 4/3.5 (SMR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.3–2.9) for Hodgkin lymphoma, 13/13.5 (SMR,  ETHYLENE OXIDE 233  
 
 0.97; 95% CI, 0.5–1.7) for leukaemia, 8/6.7 (SMR, 1 .2; 95% CI, 0.6–2.4) for non-
Hodgkin lymphoma [ICD-9 202] and 3/5.1 (SMR, 0.6; 9 5% CI, 0.1–1.7) for myeloma; 
6/11.6 (SMR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2–1.1) for cancer of th e brain and nervous system; 11/11.6 
(SMR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.5–1.7) for cancer of the stom ach; 16/16.9 (SMR, 0.95; 95% CI, 
0.5–1.5) for cancer of the pancreas; 8/7.7 (SMR, 1. 0; 95% CI, 0.4–2.1) for cancer of the 
oesophagus; and 13/7.2 (SMR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.96–3.1) for ca ncer of the kidney. Mortality 
ratios for subjects who were first exposed before 19 78 were virtually identical to those for 
the full cohort. No significant trend in mortality was observed in relation to duration of 
exposure, but the mortality ratios for leukaemia (1 .79 based on five deaths) and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (1.92 based on five deaths) were h igher after allowance for a latency 
of more than 20 years. Among the sterilizer operato rs, mortality ratios (and observed 
numbers of deaths) were 2.78 (two) for leukaemia an d 6.68 (two) for lympho-
sarcoma/reticulosarcoma; no death from stomach canc er was observed. 
In a further analysis of the same study (Stayner et al ., 1993), an exposure–response 
analysis was conducted using previously derived qua ntitative estimates of individual 
exposure to ethylene oxide (Greife et al. , 1988). Analysis was limited to 13 of the 
facilities studied, since information on exposures at the other facility was inadequate. 
Mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer was greatest in the highest category 
of cumulative exposure to ethylene oxide (> 8500 pp m–days) (13 deaths; SMR, 1.24; 
95% CI, 0.66–2.13), but the trend across three cate gories of cumulative exposure was 
weak ( χ2, 0.97; p = 0.32). A similar pattern was observed for non-Ho dgkin lymphoma, 
but not for leukaemia. In addition, a Cox proportio nal hazard model was used to examine 
risk in relation to cumulative exposure (ppm–days),  average exposure (ppm), maximal 
exposure (ppm) and duration of exposure (days) to e thylene oxide. A significant positive 
trend in risk with increasing cumulative exposure t o ethylene oxide was observed for all 
neoplasms of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissu es [ p = 0.03, two-tailed]. Moreover, 
this trend was strengthened [ p = 0.004] when the analysis was restricted to neopla sms of 
lymphoid cell origin (lymphocytic leukaemia, ICD-9 204; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 
ICD-9 200, 202). The exposure–response relationship  between cumulative exposure to 
ethylene oxide and leukaemia was positive but non-s ignificant [ p =0.15]. The regression 
coefficients for neoplasms of the lymphatic and hae matopoietic tissues for duration of, 
average and maximal exposure were either weakly pos itive or negative. In this analysis, 
no significant increase was found for cancers of th e stomach, pancreas, brain or kidney. 
[The Working Group gave greater weight to the inter nal exposure–response analyses 
using Cox regression than to those based on SMRs, since the la tter are more vulnerable to 
bias.] 
Wong and Trent (1993) reported a separate analysis of morta lity in approximately the 
same population (Steenland & Stayner, 1993), with s imilar results. The cohort comprised 
18 728 employees, and follow-up was to the end of 1 988. [The Working Group noted that 
this report adds little useful information to that provided by Steenland et al . (1991).] 
Norman et al . (1995) studied cancer incidence among 1132 worker s (82% women) 
who were employed during 1974–80 at a plant in New York State that used ethylene 234 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 oxide to sterilize medical equipment and supplies. The cohort included both regular 
employees (45%) and others who had worked only on a  temporary basis and who were 
considered to have lower potential exposures. The i nvestigation was prompted by the 
demonstration of elevated levels of sister chromati d exchange in the workforce. Leaks of 
ethylene oxide had been documented on several occas ions. From three 2-h samples 
collected in 1980, the 8-h TWA exposures of steriliz er operators were estimated to be 50–
200 ppm [90–360 mg/m 3]. Hygiene at the plant was subsequently improved, and late r 8-h 
TWA exposures were thought to be 5–20 ppm [9–36 mg/ m 3]. The cohort was followed 
for cancer incidence up to 1987, using data from va rious sources: health examinations 
(mostly conducted during 1982–85), telephone interviews ( up to 1987), mailed surveys in 
1987 and 1990, annual searches of the New York Stat e Cancer Registry during 1985–89 
and a search of the National Death Index in 1998. E xpected numbers of cancers were 
derived from age- and sex-specific rates in the Sur veillance, Epidemiology and End 
Result (SEER) programme for 1978–81. A small propor tion of subjects (about 2%) had to 
be excluded from the analysis of cancer incidence b ecause information was insufficient. 
A total of 28 cancers were identified (24 from the cancer registry and four from other 
sources), including 12 breast cancers (6.96 expecte d; SIR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.99–3.00). 
When the expected number of breast cancers was calc ulated from SEER rates for 1981–
85, it was slightly higher (7.64), and the excess f ell just short of statistical significance 
(SIR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.90–2.75). Among regular emplo yees, nine cases of breast cancer 
occurred compared with 5.28 expected from SEER rates  for 1981–85 (SIR, 1.70; 95% CI, 
0.89–3.23). When analysis was restricted to workers  who had completed at least one 
health examination or follow-up survey (approximate ly 79% of the total), the number of 
cases of breast cancer observed was again 12, but t he expected number (from SEER rates 
for 1978–81) was reduced to 4.98. The time between first exposure and diagnosis of 
breast cancer was ≤ 11 years for each of the 12 observed breast cancer  cases, and for one 
case was only 12 months. No statistically significant exc ess of mortality was observed for 
cancers at any other sites.  
Lucas and Teta (1996) subsequently drew attention to the po tential for early detection 
bias, among others, in this cohort, because the par ticipants were under active health 
surveillance and the earlier investigation of cytog enetic abnormalities may have raised 
awareness of cancer risks. The authors acknowledged this co ncern, but noted that none of 
the cases of breast cancer was discovered by screen ing carried out at the health 
examinations that formed part of the study (Norman et al ., 1996). 
Olsen et al . (1997) analysed mortality from pancreatic and lym phatic and 
haematopoietic cancer at four chemical plants where  ethylene oxide had been produced 
by the chlorohydrin process. Production of ethylene  oxide had occurred during 1941–67 
at one plant, 1951–71 and 1971–80 at the second, 19 59–70 at the third and 1936–50 at the 
fourth. At other times, and sometimes in parallel w ith ethylene oxide, the plants had also 
produced propylene oxide by the chlorohydrin proces s. Workers engaged in the 
production of ethylene chlorohydrin and its convers ion to ethylene oxide had potential 
exposure to ethylene oxide, but no data were report ed on levels of exposure. The cohort  ETHYLENE OXIDE 235  
 
 comprised men who had been employed at the relevant  facilities for at least 1 year and 
who had worked for at least 1 month in a job that h ad probably been in ethylene or 
propylene chlorohydrin production at some time sinc e these processes began. Vital status 
was followed through to 1992 from date of entry into the coho rt or (for those who entered 
the cohort before 1940) from 1940. This was achieve d by record linkage with the Social 
Security Administration and the National Death Index, a nd causes of death were obtained 
for those cohort members who had died. In the main analysis, cause-specific mortality 
was compared with that expected from death rates in the US nat ional population stratified 
by age, sex, race (white) and calendar year. Among the 1361 men eligible for study, 300 
deaths occcurred in total, including 281 in the subset who ha d worked at some time in the 
ethylene chlorohydrin process. Within this subcohort, 70 d eaths from cancer overall (73.8 
expected) were observed, including one from pancrea tic cancer (3.7 expected) and 10 
from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer (7.1 expec ted; SMR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.62–
2.38). With allowance for a 25-year induction perio d from first exposure, six lymphatic 
and haematopoietic cancers (4.2 expected; SMR, 1.44 ; 95% CI, 0.52–3.12) were 
observed. In internal analyses that used a control group  of other male employees from the 
same company at two of the three sites where the st udy plants were located, there was a 
weak trend of increasing mortality from lymphatic a nd haematopoietic cancer in relation 
to duration of employment in any chlorohydrin produ ction (ethylene or propylene), but 
this was not statistically significant. No data wer e presented on specific malignancies 
other than pancreatic and lymphatic and haematopoie tic cancers.  
In a report related to the study of Steenland et al . (1991), Steenland et al . (2003) 
examined the incidence of breast cancer in a subset  of 7576 women who had worked for 
1 year or longer at 13 of the 14 plants. The other plant was excluded because of its small 
size (only 19 women who were employed for 1 year). A postal questionnaire (sup-
plemented by a telephone interview for non-responde rs) was used to collect information 
from cohort members (or, if they had died, from the ir next of kin) on history of breast 
cancer and various known and suspected risk factors  for the disease. For plants that were 
still using ethylene oxide in the mid-1980s when th e cohort had originally been 
assembled, individual work histories were updated w ith the assumption that women 
continued to work in the same job with the same lev el of exposure to ethylene oxide 
through to the date when they were last employed at  the plant (in practice, this had little 
impact on estimates of cumulative exposures since, by the mid-1980s, exposure inten-
sities were very low). Mortality follow-up for the cohort was extended to 1998 by the 
same methods that had been used previously. The inci dence of breast cancer (also through 
to 1998) was established from a combination of ques tionnaire reports, death records and 
cancer registrations; the latter were available in nine of the 11 states in which the plants 
were located. Life-table analysis was used to compa re overall incidence of breast cancer 
in the cohort with that in the general population o f women covered by the (SEER) 
programme, with adjustment for age, calendar period  and race (white/non-white). A total 
of 319 incident cases of breast cancer were identif ied including 20 with carcinoma in situ  
and 124 who had died by the end of 1998. This gave an SIR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77–0.97) 236 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 for the cohort as a whole, which was recognized to be an underestimate because 
ascertainment of cases was incomplete for women who  were not interviewed and for 
those who did not live in states that had cancer re gistries. When cases of carcinoma in situ  
were excluded, the SIR increased slightly to 0.94. With a 15-year lag, there was a sig-
nificant trend of higher SIRs with higher cumulativ e exposures ( p = 0.002), but this was 
less marked ( p = 0.16) in an unlagged analysis. In addition to th e external comparison, a 
nested case–control design with Cox regression was used to assess internal exposure–
response relationships. In these analyses, risk set s matched on race were constructed for 
each case by randomly selecting 100 controls from t he pool of all women who had 
survived without breast cancer to at least the same  age as the index case. In an analysis 
that included all 319 cases and in which exposures were lagged by 15 years, the odds ratio 
for the highest fifth of cumulative exposure relati ve to no exposure was 1.74 (95% CI, 
1.16–2.65). In a similar analysis that was restrict ed to the subset of 5139 women who 
were interviewed (233 cases) and adjusted for parity and hi story of breast cancer in a first 
degree relative (the two potential risk factors tha t were found to be important predictors of 
breast cancer), the corresponding odds ratio was 1. 87 (95% CI, 1.12–3.10).  
[The Working Group noted that, for cancers that hav e a high survival rate in the 
general population, such as breast cancer, studies based on  incidence rather than mortality 
may be more sensitive in the detection of an elevated risk as sociated with an occupational 
exposure. In contrast, several methodological diffi culties complicate the interpretation of 
studies on the incidence of breast cancer in occupa tional cohorts, including potential 
differences in reproductive histories associated wi th employment and the possibility of 
differential rates by occupational exposure. The St eenland et al.  (2003) study was able to 
address some but not all of these potential limitat ions and was judged by the Working 
Group to provide the most pertinent evidence on the potent ial association of breast cancer 
with exposure to ethylene oxide.] 
An updated analysis of mortality from cancer in the  cohort of employees at 14 
industrial plants was reported by Steenland et al . (2004) and included 18 235 subjects 
who were followed up to 1998. Work histories for in dividuals employed at plants that 
were still using ethylene oxide at the time the coh ort had originally been assembled were 
extended to their last date of employment at the re levant plant, with an assumption that 
they did not change their job or exposure to ethylen e oxide during the additional period of 
employment. Life-table analyses were conducted with the na tional population of the USA 
as a reference. In total, 2852 deaths from all causes  (SMR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.88–0.93) were 
observed, including 860 from cancer (SMR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.9 2–1.03). The only category 
of malignancy for which mortality was significantly  elevated was cancer of the bone 
(SMR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.23–2.56). However, this findi ng was based on only six observed 
deaths, and there was no indication of an increase in risk with increasing cumulative 
exposure. Overall, mortality from cancer of the sto mach (25 deaths; SMR, 0.98; 95% CI, 
0.74–1.49), cancer of the breast (103 deaths; SMR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.84–1.17), lymphatic 
and haematopoietic cancer (79 deaths; SMR, 1.00; 95 % CI, 0.79–1.24), non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (31 deaths; SMR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.72–1.35),  Hodgkin disease (six deaths;  ETHYLENE OXIDE 237  
 
 SMR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.53–2.43), myeloma (13 deaths; SMR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.54–0.87) 
and leukaemia (28 deaths; SMR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71–1 .36) was unremarkable. In an 
internal analysis (excluding one small plant for wh ich exposure data were not available), 
cases of lymphatic and haematopoietic and breast ca ncer were matched for race, sex and 
date of birth with controls (100 per case) who had survived without these cancers to at 
least the age of the index case. When log cumulativ e exposures to ethylene oxide were 
lagged by 15 years, a statistically significant pos itive trend ( p = 0.02) was observed for 
mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer in men but not in women. However, 
duration of, peak, average or cumulative exposure d id not predict mortality from 
lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer. A similar patt ern was observed for lymphoid-cell 
tumours specifically (including non-Hodgkin lymphom a, myeloma and lymphocytic 
leukaemia). With a lag of 20 years, mortality from breast cancer was highest in women 
who had the highest quarter of exposures (odds rati o, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.42–6.92 relative to 
no exposure). 
2.3 Case–control study 
Swaen et al . (1996) carried out a case–control study within th e workforce of a 
chemical manufacturing plant in Belgium to investig ate an increased incidence of 
Hodgkin lymphoma that had been noted by the medical  director at the facility. Ten cases, 
diagnosed during 1968–91, were compared with a tota l of 200 individually matched con-
trols. The controls had been employed at the plant for at least 3 consecutive months and 
were actively employed at the time that their matche d case was diagnosed (a person could 
serve as a control for more than one case). The job  histories of cases and controls were 
abstracted from personnel records and reviewed by a  company industrial hygienist 
(blinded to health status), who assessed their pote ntial exposure to a range of chemicals. 
For 24.3% of subjects who had inadequate occupation al histories, additional data were 
then sought (unblinded to health status) from medic al records. Three cases were classed 
as exposed to ethylene oxide (odds ratio, 8.5; 95% CI, 1.4–39.9), but one of these cases 
had been reclassified as a large-cell anaplastic ca rcinoma when pathology samples were 
reviewed. 
2.4 Meta-analysis 
Teta et al . (1999) updated the earlier meta-analysis of Shore  et al . (1993) with 
inclusion of data from the study reported by Olsen et al . (1997) and the updated follow-up 
of Swedish sterilant workers reported by Hagmar et al . (1995). Thus, a total of 10 
individual cohorts were studied. Altogether, 876 ca ses of cancer were recorded compared 
with 928 expected, giving a meta-SMR standardized f or age, sex and calendar year of 
0.94 (95% CI, 0.85–1.05). Observed/expected numbers  for specific cancers were: 
pancreas, 37/39 (meta-SMR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.69–1.31) ; brain, 25/26 (meta-SMR, 0.96; 
95% CI, 0.49–1.91); stomach, 59/48 (meta-SMR, 1.23;  95% CI, 0.71–2.13); leukaemia, 238 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 35/32 (meta-SMR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.61–1.93); and non- Hodgkin lymphoma, 33/25 (meta-
SMR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.96–1.89). None of the cancers analysed showed significant trends 
in risk with increasing duration or intensity of ex posure; however, the risk for brain 
cancer increased with time since first exposure ( p < 0.05 based on four studies). 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
3.1 Inhalation exposure 
Carcinogenicity bioassays of inhalation exposure to  ethylene oxide in mice and rats 
are summarized in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. 
3.1.1  Mouse 
In a screening assay based on increased multiplicit y and incidence of lung tumours in 
a strain of mice that is highly susceptible to the development of this neoplasm, groups of 
30 female strain A/J mice, 8–10 weeks of age, were exposed by inhalation to 0, 70 or 
200 ppm [0, 128 or 366 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide (at least 99.7% pure) for 6 h per day on 
5 days per week for up to 6 months in two independe nt experiments; in the second 
experiment, the 70-ppm group was omitted. Two groups of 30  female mice were exposed 
to room air and served as negative controls, and tw o groups of 20 female mice received a 
single intraperitoneal injection of 1000 mg/kg bw ur ethane and served as positive controls 
for both experiments. At the end of the 6th month, the survivors were killed and examined 
for pulmonary adenomas. In the first experiment, su rvival was 30/30 (0 ppm), 28/30 
(70 ppm), 29/30 (200 ppm) and 19/20 (urethane); tha t in the second experiment was 
29/30 (0 ppm), 28/30 (200 ppm) and 19/20 (urethane) . The numbers of animals with 
pulmonary adenomas among survivors (and tumour mult iplicity) in the first experiment 
were: untreated controls, 8/30 (0.46 ± 0.38 [ ± SD] adenomas/mouse); low-dose, 16/28 
(0.86 ± 0.45); high-dose, 25/29 (2.14 ± 0.49); and urethane-treated, 19/19 (20.1 ± 1.77); 
those in the second experiment were: untreated cont rols, 8/29 (0.22 ± 0.38); ethylene 
oxide-treated, 12/28 (0.73 ± 0.98); and urethane-treated, 19/19 (23.5 ± 6.49). The tumour 
multiplicity increased significantly in each experi ment ( p < 0.05, Duncan’s new multiple-
range test); in the first experiment, it also incre ased significantly in a dose-dependent 
manner [ p < 0.001, Cochran-Armitage trend test] (Adkins et al ., 1986). 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F 1 mice, 8 weeks of age, were exposed by 
inhalation to 0, 50 or 100 ppm [0, 92 or 183 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide (> 99% pure) for 6 h 
per day on 5 days per week for up to 102 weeks, at which time the experiment was 
terminated. Mean body weights of treated males and females were similar to those of 
controls. At the end of the study, 28/50 control, 3 1/50 low-dose and 34/50 high-dose 
males, and 25/50 control, 24/50 low-dose and 31/50 high-dose females were still alive.  ETHYLENE OXIDE 239

a Brain tumours were gliomas. Focal proliferations of  glial cells (termed ‘gliosis’) were also observed in two low-dose rats and four high-dose rats.

  ETHYLENE OXIDE 241  
 
 The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas in  male mice was 6/50 control, 10/50 
low-dose and 16/50 high-dose ( p = 0.019, incidental tumour test for trend). A slig ht 
increase in the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar a denomas also occurred. The combined 
incidence of lung tumours was 11/50 control, 19/50 low-dose and 26/50 high-dose 
(p = 0.002, incidental tumour test for trend). In fem ales, the incidence of alve-
olar/bronchiolar adenomas (2/49 control, 4/48 low-d ose and 17/49 high-dose) and alve-
olar/bronchiolar carcinomas (0/49 control, 1/48 low -dose and 7/49 high-dose) and the 
combined incidence of lung tumours (2/49 control, 5 /48 low-dose and 22/49 high-dose) 
were all significantly increased ( p < 0.001, incidental tumour test for trend). The in cid-
ence of papillary cystadenoma of the Harderian glan d increased significantly in animals 
of each sex (males: 1/43 control, 9/44 low-dose and  8/42 high-dose; females: 1/46 
control, 6/46 low-dose and 8/47 high-dose; p < 0.04, incidental tumour test for trend in 
both sexes). In addition, one papillary cystadenoca rcinoma of the Harderian gland was 
observed in one high-dose male and one in a low-dos e female. In females, the incidence 
of malignant lymphomas was 9/49 control, 6/48 low-d ose and 22/49 high-dose mice 
(p = 0.023, life-table test for trend). An increase i n the incidence of uterine adeno-
carcinomas was observed in 0/49 control, 2/47 low-d ose and 5/49 high-dose females 
(p < 0.03, incidental tumour test for trend). The inc idence of mammary gland carcinomas 
in females was 1/49 control, 8/48 low-dose ( p = 0.012, incidental pair-wise tumour test) 
and 6/49 high-dose mice (National Toxicology Progra m, 1987). Because of the rarity of 
primary epithelial tumours of the uterus in long-te rm inhalation studies in mice, data on 
the pathology and incidence of uterine tumours in B 6C3F 1 mice from 2-year National 
Toxicology Program inhalation bioassays of bromoeth ane, chloroethane and ethylene 
oxide were reviewed. Diagnoses of uterine adenocarc inoma in the 1987 bioassay of 
ethylene oxide were confirmed (Picut et al ., 2003). [The Working Group noted that the 
diagnosis of uterine adenoma in one low-dose female  was revised to adenocarcinoma.] 
3.1.2  Rat 
Groups of 80 male weanling Fischer 344 rats were ex posed by inhalation to 0 
(control; filtered air), 50 or 100 ppm [92 or 180 m g/m 3] ethylene oxide (purity, 99.7%) 
vapour for approximately 7 h per day on 5 days per week for 2 years. The mortality rate 
was increased in the two treated groups over that i n controls, and the increase was 
significant for the high-dose group ( p < 0.01). Mononuclear-cell leukaemia was observed 
in 24/77 control rats, in 38/79 rats exposed to 50 ppm ethylene oxide and in 30/76 
exposed to 100 ppm. The overall increase in the inci dence of mononuclear-cell leukaemia 
was significant ( p = 0.03) in the low-dose group, but the increase could not be  ascertained 
in the high-dose group because of excessive mortali ty. Peritoneal mesotheliomas in the 
region of the testis developed in 3/78 control, 9/79 low-dos e and 21/79 high-dose rats; the 
increase was significant for the high-dose group ( p = 0.002). Gliomas (mixed cell type) 
were found in 0/76 control, 2/77 low-dose and 5/79 high-dose animals ( p < 0.05, pair-
wise comparison for the high dose). Focal prolifera tion of glial cells (termed ‘gliosis’) 242 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 was observed in two rats exposed to 50 ppm and four  rats exposed to 100 ppm ethylene 
oxide. [The Working Group noted that lesions such a s those described as ‘gliosis’ are 
probably glial tumours, and that true gliosis is a reactive lesion and not a neoplasm.] The 
incidence of other neoplasms was comparable in the control and treated groups and was 
not associated with exposure to ethylene oxide. A h igh incidence of proliferative lesions 
described as ‘multifocal cortical hyperplasia’ and ‘cortical nodular hyperplasia’ was 
observed in the adrenal cortex of animals exposed t o ethylene oxide (Lynch et al ., 1984a).  
Three groups of 120 male and three groups of 120 fe male Fischer 344 rats, 8 weeks of 
age, were exposed by inhalation to 10, 33 or 100 pp m [18, 59 or 180 mg/m 3] ethylene 
oxide (purity, > 99.9%) vapour for 6 h per day on 5 days per wee k for up to 2 years. Two 
control groups (I and II), each of 120 male and 120  female rats, were exposed in 
inhalation chambers to room air. All animals that d ied or were killed when moribund and 
those killed at scheduled intervals of 6, 12, 18 an d 24 (females)–25 (males) months were 
examined. During month 15 of exposure, mortality in creased in both treated and control 
groups due to a viral sialodacryoadenitis. Mortalit y was higher in the groups exposed to 
33 and 100 ppm ethylene oxide than in the other gro ups and was also higher in females 
than in males. Up to 18 months of exposure, no sign ificant increase in tumour incidence 
was observed. In treated rats killed after 18 month s, the incidence of brain tumours 
classified as ‘gliomas, malignant reticulosis and g ranular-cell tumours’ was increased in 
animals of each sex. The incidence of brain tumours  (gliomas only) among rats killed at 
18 and 24–25 months was: males: 1/181 (controls), 0 /92 (10 ppm), 3/85 (33 ppm) and 
6/87 (100 ppm) ( p < 0.05, Cox’s test for adjusted trend and Fisher’s  exact test for high-
dose versus control); and females: 0/187 (controls) , 1/94 (10 ppm), 2/90 (33 ppm) and 
2/78 (100 ppm) ( p < 0.05, Cox’s test for adjusted trend). In females k illed after 24 months 
of exposure, mononuclear-cell leukaemia was found i n 5/60 (control I), 6/56 (control II), 
11/54 (10 ppm), 14/48 (33 ppm) and 15/26 (100 ppm) animals; the incidence of 
leukaemia was reported by the authors to be significantly in creased in the 100-ppm group 
(p < 0.001) and in a mortality-adjusted trend test ( p < 0.005). In males, mononuclear-cell 
leukaemia was found in 5/48 (control I), 8/49 (cont rol II), 9/51 (10 ppm), 12/39 (33 ppm) 
and 9/30 (100 ppm) animals ( p < 0.05, mortality-adjusted trend test). Peritoneal  
mesotheliomas originating in the testicular serosa were found in 1/48 (control I), 1/49 
(control II), 2/51 (10 ppm), 4/39 (33 ppm) and 4/30  (100 ppm) males ( p < 0.005, trend 
test). The incidence of subcutaneous fibromas in ma le rats of the high-dose group was 
also significantly increased: 1/48 (control I), 2/4 9 (control II), 9/51 (10 ppm), 1/39 
(33 ppm) and 11/30 (100 ppm) ( p < 0.01) (Snellings et al ., 1984; Garman et al ., 1985, 
1986).  ETHYLENE OXIDE 243  
 
 3.2 Oral administration 
Rat 
Groups of 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats, approximat ely 100 days of age, were 
administered 7.5 or 30.5 mg/kg bw ethylene oxide (p urity, 99.7%) in a commercial vege-
table oil [composition unspecified] by gastric intu bation twice weekly for 107 weeks 
(average total dose, 1186 or 5112 mg/kg bw, respective ly). Controls comprised one group 
of 50 untreated female rats and a second group of 5 0 female rats treated with vegetable oil 
alone. The survival rate of rats in the high-dose g roup was lower than that of the control 
groups. Treatment with ethylene oxide resulted in a  dose-dependent increase in the 
incidence of forestomach tumours, which were mainly  squamous-cell carcinomas. Such 
tumours were not found in the untreated or vehicle controls. In the low-dose group, 8/50 
animals developed squamous-cell carcinomas, 4/50 ha d carcinomas in situ  and 9/50 had 
papillomas, hyperplasia or hyperkeratosis of the fo restomach. In the high-dose group, 
31/50 animals developed malignant tumours of the st omach; 29 were squamous-cell 
carcinomas of the forestomach and two were fibrosar comas, one of which was located in 
the glandular stomach. In addition, 4/50 had carcinom as in situ  and 11/50 had papillomas, 
hyperplasia or hyperkeratosis of the forestomach. M any of the stomach tumours found in 
the high-dose group metastasized or grew invasively int o neighbouring organs. There was 
no increase in the incidence of tumours at other si tes in the treated animals over that in 
controls (Dunkelberg, 1982).  
3.3 Dermal application 
Mouse 
Thirty female ICR/Ha Swiss mice, 8 weeks of age at the start of treatment, received 
topical applications of approximately 100 mg of a 10% solut ion of ethylene oxide (purity, 
99.7%) in acetone on the clipped dorsal skin three times a week for life. The median 
survival time was 493 days. No skin tumour was obse rved (Van Duuren et al ., 1965). 
[The Working Group noted the high volatility of eth ylene oxide which would tend to 
reduce the dose that the animals received.] 
3.4 Subcutaneous administration 
Mouse 
Groups of 100 female NMRI mice, 6–8 weeks of age, r eceived subcutaneous 
injections of 0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 mg/mouse ethylene oxide (puri ty, 99.7%) in tricaprylin once a 
week for 95 weeks (mean total dose, 7.3, 22.7 or 64 .4 mg/mouse). Groups of 200 un-
treated and 200 tricaprylin-treated mice served as controls. The survival rate of the group 
given the highest dose was reduced. Ethylene oxide induce d a dose-dependent increase in 244 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 the incidence of sarcomas at the injection site. Sa rcomas occurred in 0/200 untreated 
controls, 4/200 animals treated with tricaprylin al one, and 5/100, 8/100 and 11/100 
animals that received 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg ethylene ox ide, respectively [ p < 0.001, Cochran-
Armitage test for trend]. No significant increase i n the incidence of tumours at other sites 
was observed (Dunkelberg, 1981). 
3.5 Induction of enzyme-altered foci in a two-stage liver system  
Rat 
Litters  of Sprague-Dawley rats, 3–5 days of age, were expos ed with their dams by 
inhalation to 0 ppm (five male and nine female rats ), 33 ppm (60 mg/m 3, 10 females), 
55 ppm (100 mg/m 3, four males and seven females) or 100 ppm (183 mg/ m 3, four males 
and eight females) ethylene oxide [purity unspecifi ed] for 8 h per day on 5 consecutive 
days per week for 3 weeks. One week later, the offs pring were administered, as a 
promoting agent, 10 mg/kg bw Clophen A 50 (a mixtur e of polychlorinated biphenyls 
[not otherwise specified]) orally by gavage twice a  week for up to 8 additional weeks, at 
which time the experiment was terminated. The liver s were examined for adenosine 
triphosphatase-deficient and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive foci. In females t hat 
received the two highest doses, but not in males, t he number and total area of adenosine 
triphosphatase-deficient foci increased significant ly ( p < 0.05, Student’s t test) in 
comparison with the controls that received Clophen A 50 only. There was no significant 
difference in the number or total area of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive foci between 
controls and animals given the high dose of ethylen e oxide (Denk et al ., 1988). 
4.     Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data  
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
4.1.1  Humans 
(a) Absorption, distribution and excretion 
Ethylene oxide is readily taken up by the lungs and  is absorbed relatively efficiently 
into the blood. A study of workers exposed to ethyl ene oxide revealed an alveolar reten-
tion of 75–80%, calculated from hourly determinatio ns of ethylene oxide concentrations 
in the environmental air that ranged from 0.2 to 24 .1 mg/m 3 [0.11–13.2 ppm] and in 
alveolar air that ranged from 0.05 to 6 mg/m 3 [0.03–3.3 ppm] (Brugnone et al ., 1985, 
1986). At steady state, therefore, 20–25% of inhale d ethylene oxide that reached the 
alveolar space was exhaled as the unchanged compound  and 75–80% was taken up by the 
body and metabolized. Blood samples taken from work ers 4 h after the workshift gave 
venous blood:alveolar air coefficients of 12–17 and  venous blood:environmental air  ETHYLENE OXIDE 245  
 
 coefficients of 2.5–3.3. The difference from the va lue of 90 samples determined for the 
blood:air partition coefficient in vitro  was explained by incomplete saturation of tissues 
and limitation of the metabolic rate by the rate of  lung uptake (Brugnone et al ., 1986).  
(b) Metabolism 
The following overall schema describes the mammalia n metabolism of ethylene 
oxide (Figure 2). Ethylene oxide is converted ( a) by enzymatic and non-enzymatic 
hydrolysis to ethylene glycol, which is partly excr eted as such and partly metabolized 
further via glycolaldehyde, glycolic acid and glyox alic acid to oxalic acid, formic acid and 
carbon dioxide; and ( b) by conjugation with glutathione (GSH) followed by  further 
metabolism to S-(2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine, S-(2-carboxymethyl)cysteine and N-acetylated 
derivatives ( N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine (also termed S-(2-hydroxyethyl)mercap-
turic acid or HEMA) and N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxymethyl)cysteine) (Wolfs et al. , 1983; 
Popp et al. , 1994), which are partly converted to thiodiacetic  acid (Scheick et al ., 1997).

 Blood concentrations of ethylene glycol were determ ined at the end of day 3 of a 
normal working week in sterilization personnel who were exposed to ethylene oxide. 
TWA concentrations of ethylene oxide determined ove r 8 h ranged from 0.3 to 52 ppm 
[0.55–95.2 mg/m 3] (overall mean, 4.2 ppm [7.7 mg/m 3]). The mean concentrations of 
ethylene glycol in the blood of exposed subjects were twic e as high (90 mg/L) as those in 
controls (45 mg/L) (Wolfs et al ., 1983).  
The concentration of thioethers excreted in urine c ollected at the end of sterilization 
processes was found to be twice as high in nonsmoki ng personnel (10.2 mmol/mol 
creatinine) exposed to peak concentrations of 1–200  ppm [1.83–366 mg/m 3] ethylene 
oxide as that in unexposed workers (5.46 mmol/mol c reatinine). The concentration of 
ethylene oxide in air was not monitored routinely ( Burgaz et al ., 1992). 
The glutathione- S-transferase (GST) activity for ethylene oxide in h uman liver 
cytosolic fractions was low (too low to determine t he Michaelis-Menten constant [K m] 
value). The maximum velocity (V max ) varied from 7.6 to 10.6 nmol/min/mg protein. 
Epoxide hydrolase (EH) activity in the microsomal f raction of the human liver averaged 
1.8 nmol/min/mg protein. The K m for hydrolysis has been estimated to be approximat ely 
0.2 mM, but non-enzymatic hydrolysis was significan t and precluded accurate deter-
mination (Fennell & Brown, 2001). 
Metabolism of ethylene oxide to the GSH conjugate a nd ethylene glycol is generally 
considered to be the major pathway for the eliminat ion of DNA-reactive ethylene oxide. 
However, strongly suggestive evidence in vitro  was presented by Hengstler et al.  (1994) 
that glycolaldehyde is formed by further metabolism  of ethylene glycol and that this 
derivative leads to DNA–protein cross-links and to DNA str and breaks (as measured with 
the alkaline elution assay) after in-vitro incubati on with human peripheral mononuclear 
blood cells.  
(c) GST polymorphisms 
Ethylene oxide is a substrate of the GST isoenzyme T1 (Hayes et al. , 2005). This 
isoenzyme is polymorphic and a relatively large pop ulation (in Caucasians about 20%, in 
Asians almost 50%) has a homozygous deletion (null genotype) (Bolt & Thier, 2006). As 
expected, these individuals show a significantly hi gher amount of hydroxyethyl valine in 
their haemoglobin due to the metabolism of endogenous et hylene to endogenous ethylene 
oxide (Thier et al. , 2001). Nevertheless, the influence of this genetic  trait on the formation 
of these haemoglobin adducts by workplace exposure to exogenous ethylene oxide is 
much less clear, as discussed below. 
In the cytoplasm of erythrocytes obtained from 36 i ndividuals, ethylene oxide was 
eliminated three to six times faster in samples fro m so-called conjugators (defined by a 
standardized conjugation reaction of methyl bromide  and GSH; 75% of the population) 
than in those from the remaining 25% (who lack this  GST-specific activity). In the latter 
samples, disappearance did not differ from that of controls. In this experiment, the dis-
appearance of ethylene oxide was investigated in th e gas phase of closed vials that 
contained GSH and cytoplasm of erythrocytes (Hallie r et al. , 1993).  ETHYLENE OXIDE 247  
 
 In contrast, several publications reported no or an  unclear association between 
GSTT1 status and hydroxyethyl adducts after workpla ce exposure to ethylene oxide 
(HEMA formation) (Haufroid et al. , 2007) or exposure to ethylene oxide from cigarett e 
smoking (hydroxyethyl valine in haemoglobin) (Mülle r et al. , 1998) . Other studies 
reported a relatively weak but significant associat ion (0.17 ± 0.03 N-(2-hydroxy-
ethyl)valine formed in haemoglobin versus 0.08 ± ≤ 0.01; p ≤ 0.02) after exposure to 
ethylene oxide of individuals who had homozygous de letion of the GSTT1  gene com-
pared with those who had at least one copy of the g ene (Yong et al. , 2001). 
The different impact of the GSTT1  polymorphism is due to the fact that, in the study  
of Hallier et al.  (1993), cytoplasm of erythrocytes was exposed to e thylene oxide, while in 
the subsequent studies, the whole human organism wa s exposed to ethylene oxide. 
Similarly, Föst et al.  (1995) also observed that, when ethylene oxide is added to whole 
blood of various individuals, the impact of the GSTT1  polymorphism is significant.  
In-vitro incubation of mononuclear blood cells from  various individuals with 
polymorphisms in GSTs ( GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 ) did not demonstrate a significant 
influence on ethylene oxide-induced DNA strand brea ks (measured by the Comet assay) 
and on micronucleus formation in binucleated cells (Godderis et al. , 2006). This lack of 
an effect is presumably due to the null or negligib le contribution of GSTM1 and GSTP1 
enzymes to ethylene oxide metabolism and to a too s mall (20%) contribution of GSTT1 
activity in the human whole organism (Figure 2).  
(d) Haemoglobin adducts  
Ethylene oxide is an electrophilic agent that alkyl ates nucleophilic groups in 
biological macromolecules. Haemoglobin adducts have b een used to monitor tissue doses 
of ethylene oxide (Calleman et al ., 1978; Farmer et al ., 1987; Osterman-Golkar & 
Bergmark, 1988; Ehrenberg, 1991; Ehrenberg & Törnqv ist, 1992). The results have 
shown measurable increases in hydroxyethyl haemoglo bin adducts that are dependent on 
the workplace exposure concentration (reported and discussed in IARC, 1994).  
Cigarette smoke contains ethylene oxide, and hydroxy ethyl valine in the haemoglobin 
of smokers correlates with the number of cigarettes smoked ( Fennell et al. , 2000; Bono et 
al. , 2002; Wu et al. , 2004). The umbilical cord blood of smoking pregna nt women 
contained increased levels of hydroxyethyl valine, which were quantitatively related to 
the increased levels in maternal blood (Farmer et al. , 1996a). Levels of this adduct were 
significantly higher in the haemoglobin of newborns  from smoking compared with those 
from nonsmoking mothers (147 ± 68 compared with 42 ± 18 pmol/g haemoglobin; 
p ≤ 0.01) (Tavares et al. , 1994). In GSTT1 -null individuals, levels of hydroxyethyl valine 
were significantly elevated when normalized to smok ing status or levels of cotinine. The 
lack of functional GSTT1 was estimated to increase the internal dose of ethy lene oxide 
derived from cigarette smoke by 50–70% (Fennell et al. , 2000). Ethylene oxide is also 
formed endogenously in humans (Bolt, 1996). This ma y limit the sensitivity of this adduct 
as a biomarker for cigarette smoking; indeed, the f ormation of hydroxyethyl valine was 248 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 not associated with exposure to secondhand smoke or  with tea or alcoholic beverage 
consumption, age or gender (Wu et al. , 2004).   
(e)  Toxicokinetic modelling 
A recent model by Fennell and Brown (2001) determine d a half-life of ethylene oxide 
in the human body of 47.6 min, taking into account the enzymatic disposition of ethylene 
oxide by human liver microsomal EH (mEH) and cytoso lic GST by their K m and V max  
characteristics, as well as a possible depletion of  GSH. This half-life value was quite close 
to the 42-min value obtained by Filser et al.  (1992). In this human model, the majority of 
ethylene oxide is metabolized by hydrolysis, and on ly approximately 20% is converted to 
GSH conjugates. There is little change in metabolis m with increasing exposure 
concentration. At given exposure concentrations of ethylene oxide (1, 100 and 300 ppm 
[1.83, 183 and 549 mg/m 3]), blood concentration was sensitive to alveolar v entilation and 
to Km and V max  for liver mEH but relatively insensitive to the li ver GSH concentration and 
the rate of GSH synthesis in the liver. 
4.1.2 Experimental systems  
(a) Absorption, distribution and excretion 
Pulmonary uptake of ethylene oxide is expected to b e rapid and dependent only upon 
the alveolar ventilation rate and concentration in the inspired air, since this compound is 
very soluble in blood (IPCS, 1985). Ethylene oxide is absorbed rapidly through the 
respiratory tract in rats (Filser & Bolt, 1984; Kog a et al. , 1987; Tardif et al. , 1987), mice 
(Ehrenberg et al. , 1974; Tardif et al. , 1987) and rabbits (Tardif et al. , 1987). Close to 
100% of inhaled ethylene oxide was absorbed by mice  that were exposed for 1–2 h to 2–
55 mg/m 3 (1.1–30 ppm) (Ehrenberg et al. , 1974). 
The permeation rate of a solution of 1% ethylene ox ide in water (w/v) through 
excised human skin at 30 ºC was determined to be 0. 125 mg/(cm 2 × h) (Baumbach et al ., 
1987).  
The pharmacokinetics of inhaled ethylene oxide have  been investigated in male 
Sprague-Dawley (Filser & Bolt, 1984) and Fischer 34 4 rats (Krishnan et al ., 1992). The 
studies were carried out in closed exposure chamber s of 6.4 and 9.5 L occupied by two 
and three rats, respectively. The initial concentra tions of ethylene oxide vapour in the 
chamber atmospheres were up to about 1100 ppm [2000  mg/m 3]. Filser and Bolt (1984) 
showed that ethylene oxide is rapidly taken up by t he lungs because the clearance due to 
uptake, which reflects the rate of transfer of ethy lene oxide from the atmosphere into the 
organism, was 11 100 mL/h (185 mL/min) for two Spra gue-Dawley rats that weighed 
500 g. Johanson and Filser (1992) calculated a valu e of 58 mL/min for one Sprague-
Dawley rat that weighed 250 g by allometric scaling , according to the method of Filser 
(1992). This value represents 50% of the alveolar v entilation (117 mL/min; Arms & 
Travis, 1988), which indicates that about 50% of th e amount inhaled into the lung is 
exhaled again without becoming systemically availab le via the bloodstream. A possible  ETHYLENE OXIDE 249  
 
 explanation for this finding is that there is a ‘wa sh in-wash out’ effect in the upper air-
ways (Johanson & Filser, 1992), which may be more e ffective in rats than in humans 
(Filser et al ., 1993). The maximal accumulation of ethylene oxide  in the body of Sprague-
Dawley rats, determined as the thermodynamic partit ion coefficient for whole body:air, 
was 30. Because of fast metabolic elimination, the concentration ratio at steady state for 
whole body:air, calculated for two animals that wei ghed 500 g, was only 1.52 over the 
entire dose range. A re-calculation of this paramet er according to Filser (1992) for one 
Sprague-Dawley rat that weighed 250 g yielded a val ue of 1.88, which is similar to the 
coefficient for venous blood:environmental air foun d in workers exposed to ethylene 
oxide under steady-state conditions (see above).  
An almost uniform distribution of ethylene oxide wi thin the body was concluded 
from the similar tissue:air partition coefficients for organs of male Fischer 344 rats deter-
mined in vitro : fat, 44.1; muscle, 48.3; brain, 58.7; lung, 60.9; l iver, 61.6; blood, 64.1; and 
testes, 83 (Krishnan et al ., 1992).  
Elimination of ethylene oxide was described by firs t-order kinetics over the whole 
concentration range examined in both Sprague-Dawley  (Filser & Bolt, 1984) and Fischer 
344 rats (Krishnan et  al ., 1992). At steady state, the clearance due to met abolism in re-
lation to the concentration in the atmosphere was 1 0 600 mL/h (177 mL/min) for two 
Sprague-Dawley rats that weighed 500 g (Filser & Bo lt, 1984). Re-calculation for one 
Sprague-Dawley rat that weighed 250 g according to the method of Filser (1992) gave a 
value of almost 55 mL/min. On the basis of the find ing that clearance due to metabolism 
in relation to the concentration in the atmosphere is nearly identical to that due to uptake, 
uptake of ethylene oxide by inhalation was conclude d to be the rate-limiting step for 
metabolism of this compound. Alveolar retention in one Sprague-Dawley rat that 
weighed 250 g was calculated as 47% on the basis of  a ventilation rate of 117 mL/min 
and clearance of metabolism in relation to the conc entration in the atmosphere of 55 
mL/min. The half-life was reported to be 6 min in t wo animals that weighed 500 g (Bolt 
& Filser, 1987).  
Clearance rates of ethylene oxide from the blood, b rain, muscle and testes were nearly 
identical. Following a 4-h inhalation exposure of B 6C3F 1 mice and Fischer 344 rats to 
100 ppm [183 mg/m 3], the average blood elimination half-lives were 2. 4–3.2 min in mice 
and 11–14 min in rats (Brown et al ., 1996, 1998). 
In male Fischer 344/N rats exposed by nose-only inh alation for 60 min to 5 ppm 
[9.2 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide, a steady-state blood level of abo ut 60 ng/g was reached after 
15 min (Maples & Dahl, 1993). 
After 4-h inhalation exposures of B6C3F 1 mice to 0, 50, 100, 200, 300 or 400 ppm [0, 
91.5, 183, 366, 549 or 732 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide, concentrations of ethylene oxide in the 
blood increased linearly with inhaled concentration s of less than 200 ppm, but the blood 
concentration increased more rapidly than linearly above that level. GSH levels in the 
liver, lung, kidney and testes decreased as exposur es increased above 200 ppm, which 
indicated that, at low concentrations, GSH conjugat ion is responsible for the dis-
appearance of ethylene oxide but, at higher concent rations when tissue GSH begins to be 250 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 depleted, the elimination occurs via a slower hydro lysis process, which leads to a greater 
than linear increase in blood concentrations of eth ylene oxide (Brown et al. , 1998).  
(b) Metabolism 
For an overview of mammalian metabolism of ethylene  oxide, see Figure 2. 
For early identification and quantification of mamm alian metabolites of ethylene 
oxide, see IARC (1994). 
After intravenous injection of 1 and 10 mg/kg bw et hylene oxide to male Sprague-
Dawley rats, HEMA was excreted as a constant percen tage of the dose: about 30% from 0 
to 12 h and 5% from 12 to 24 h. Following administr ation of 100 mg/kg bw ethylene 
oxide, the corresponding percentages were 16% and 5 %, respectively. These results 
indicate that the capacity for GSH conjugation at the high do se could have been exceeded 
within the first 12 h (Gérin & Tardif, 1986).  
Ethylene glycol, 2-hydroxyethylmercapturic acid, 2- methylthioethanol and 2-mer-
captoethanol were identified as metabolites in the urine of male Wistar rats exposed for 
6 h to 500 ppm [915 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide (Koga et al ., 1987). The amounts of ethylene 
glycol in the urine of male Wistar rats collected dur ing 6-h exposures to 50, 100, 200, 300 
and 500 ppm [91.5, 183, 366, 549 and 915 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide and up to 20 h there-
after were 0.2, 0.35, 1.0, 2.5 and 4.2 mg, and thus  increased disproportionately to the ex-
posure concentrations (Koga et al ., 1985). These findings may indicate a relative decr ease 
in GSH conjugation. 
The pattern of excretion of ethylene oxide metaboli tes in mice, rats and rabbits was 
investigated in urine collected 24 h after treatmen t with ethylene oxide, either intra-
venously (20 and 60 mg/kg bw) or by inhalation for 6 h (about 200 ppm [366 mg/m 3]). 
Marked species differences were seen (Table 9), sin ce metabolites that resulted from 
conjugation of ethylene oxide with GSH were found i n the urine of male Swiss CD-1 
mice and male Sprague-Dawley rats but not in that o f rabbits [strain not given]. HEMA 
was excreted in the urine of mice and rats, but S-(2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine and 
S-(carboxymethyl)cysteine were present only in the u rine of mice. Ethylene glycol, the 
reaction product of the enzymatic and non-enzymatic  hydrolysis of ethylene oxide, was 
found in the urine of all three species (Tardif et al ., 1987).  
(c) GSH depletion 
Treatment of animals with ethylene oxide lowered th e concentration of GSH in 
various tissues. Immediately after a 4-h exposure o f male Swiss-Webster mice and 
Fischer 344 rats to atmospheric concentrations of 1 00, 400 and 900 ppm [183, 732 and 
1647 mg/m 3] (mice) and 100, 600 and 1200 ppm [183, 1098 and 2 196 mg/m 3] (rats) 
ethylene oxide, concentration-related decreases in GSH levels were observed in the 
kidney, heart, lung, brain, stomach, spleen, testis and liv er of both species, in the blood of 
mice but not of rats and in bone marrow, which was examined in rats only. In both 
species, the GSH levels were reduced to a greater extent in th e liver, lung and stomach  ETHYLENE OXIDE 251

than in other organs. After exposure to the highest  concentrations, GSH levels in the 
tissues were depressed to 20–30% of the control val ues (McKelvey & Zemaitis, 1986). 
Concentrations of GSH in the hepatic cytosol of male  Wistar rats decreased to 37% of 
that of controls after a single exposure (4 h) to 5 00 ppm [915 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide, to 
13% after exposure to 1500 ppm [2745 mg/m 3] (Katoh et al ., 1990) and to 5% after 
exposure to 2500 ppm [4575 mg/m 3] (Nakashima et al ., 1987). Immediately after the last 
of a series of repeated exposures of male Wistar ra ts to 500 ppm [915 mg/m 3] ethylene 
oxide for 6 h per day on 3 days per week for 6 weeks, the hepatic  GSH concentration was 
decreased by 50%. Control values were reached again  12 h thereafter (Katoh et al ., 1989).  
The consequences of GSH depletion on the occurrence  of non-linear increases in the 
concentration of ethylene oxide in the blood with i ncreasing external doses of ethylene 
oxide is discussed in Section 4.1.2( a). Haemoglobin adduct formation in mice and rats 
exposed to 0, 3, 10, 33, 100 and 300 (rats only) pp m [0, 5.49, 18.3, 60.39, 183 and 
549 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide for 6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 4 weeks was linear in 
both species up to 33 ppm, after which the slope in creased more than proportionately 
(Walker et al .,  1992a). The dose-related decrease in hepatic GSH co ncentration (Brown 252 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 et al ., 1998) provides a plausible explanation for the m ore than proportional increase in 
hydroxyethylated haemoglobin (see below). In both r ats and mice, depletion of GSH was 
already considerable following a single exposure to  high levels (i.e. 550 mg/m 3) of 
ethylene oxide (McKelvey & Zemaitis, 1986; Brown et al. , 1998). 
(d)  Haemoglobin adducts 
Binding of ethylene oxide to haemoglobin has been r eviewed in some detail (IARC, 
1994). In-vitro treatment of mouse, rat and human cells w ith ethylene oxide demonstrated 
the formation of adducts with S-cysteine, histidine and N-terminal valine in haemoglobin. 
The second-order rate constants were approximately the same for histidine and valine 
across the three species; however, large species di fferences were seen with respect to 
S-cysteine (Segerbäck, 1990). In studies of the fate  of ethylene oxide in mice, single 
exposures to this epoxide produced in a dose-depend ent manner haemoglobin adducts 
that disappeared at a rate predicted by the normal life-span of the red blood cells. These 
data suggested that stable haemoglobin adducts would accu mulate over the lifetime of the 
erythrocyte during chronic exposures to ethylene ox ide and provided the basis for the 
concept of using haemoglobin adducts to monitor int egral doses of alkylating agents. 
Single intraperitoneal injections of and multiple i nhalation exposures to ethylene oxide 
generally yielded linear dose–response relationship s between dose and histidine and 
valine haemoglobin adduct levels. However, chronic inhalation exposures of male Fischer 
344 rats to 10, 33 or 100 ppm [18.3, 60.4 or 183 mg /m 3] ethylene oxide under cancer 
bioassay conditions (6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 2 years) resulted in a non-linear 
dose–response curve for Nτ-(2-hydroxyethyl)histidine (Osterman-Golkar et al. , 1983). 
Comparisons of the data from single-dose or 4-week inhalation exposure studies of rats 
versus a study of rats exposed for 2 years suggeste d that the dose–response relationship 
between the concentration of ethylene oxide and the  formation of haemoglobin adducts 
can change over time during repeated exposure to th is epoxide (Walker et al. , 1992a). 
More recent studies on haemoglobin adducts in ethylene oxi de-exposed mice and rats 
have focused on ( a) potential species differences in the relationship s between exposure, 
accumulation of haemoglobin adducts over time durin g repeated exposures and the 
dynamics in loss of adducts after discontinuation o f exposures (Fennell et al. , 1992; 
Walker et al. , 1992a); and ( b) comparisons of the formation and persistence of a dducts in 
haemoglobin and DNA (Walker et al. , 1993), and the relationships between exposure, 
levels of haemoglobin adducts as a marker of dose a nd induction of somatic mutations 
(Tates et al. , 1999). Results of species comparisons of the form ation and persistence of 
N-(2-hydroxyethyl)valine have been summarized previo usly (IARC, 1994). In brief, 
dose-related levels of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)valine were reported to be similar  in mice and 
rats exposed to ethylene oxide (3–100 ppm [5.49–183  mg/m 3] for 4 weeks), while the 
adducts were lost in a species-specific pattern rel ated to a differing life-span of red blood 
cells in each species. However, the relationships b etween N-(2-hydroxyethyl)valine in 
haemoglobin and N7-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine in DNA varied with length  of exposure, 
interval since exposure, species and tissue, which led the authors to conclude that the  ETHYLENE OXIDE 253  
 
 haemoglobin adducts were unlikely to provide accura te predictions of DNA adducts in 
tissues under conditions in which the actual scenar io of exposure to ethylene oxide is 
unknown (Walker et al. , 1993). Tates et al.  (1999) measured N-(2-hydroxyethyl)valine to 
determine blood levels of ethylene oxide in rats an d then used the estimated blood doses 
to compare the mutagenic effects of ethylene oxide vi a three routes of exposure, including 
single intraperitoneal injections, ingestion via th e drinking-water or inhalation; 
comparisons of the mutagenic responses from alterna tive treatments with ethylene oxide 
are considered below. Other studies that measured t he formation of N-(2-hydroxy-
ethyl)valine in mice and rats after inhalation of e thylene oxide have typically used this 
haemoglobin adduct as a marker of exposure for comp arison with DNA adducts in the 
same animals (Walker et al. , 2000; Rusyn et al. , 2005). In general, the same relationships 
were found as those reported in the earlier rodent studies of ethylene oxide that are 
summarized above. 
(e) Toxicokinetic modelling 
A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model has b een developed for dosimetry of 
inhaled and intravenously injected ethylene oxide i n rats (Krishnan et al ., 1992). The 
model enables the determination of tissue distribut ion, metabolic pathways, i.e. hydrolysis 
by EH and conjugation with GSH by GST, depletion of  hepatic and extrahepatic GSH 
and binding of ethylene oxide to haemoglobin and DN A. The biochemical parameters 
used in the model were obtained by fitting data obtai ned after inhalation of ethylene oxide 
in closed chambers to data on tissue GSH concentrat ions (McKelvey & Zemaitis, 1986) 
and on levels of hydroxyethyl adducts in haemoglobi n and tissue DNA (Potter et al ., 
1989). The model was validated by comparing simulat ed and published data on urinary 
excretion of HEMA after inhalation and intravenous administration of ethylene oxide 
(Gérin & Tardif, 1986; Tardif et al ., 1987) and on levels of hydroxyethyl adducts in 
haemoglobin and tissue DNA after exposure for 6 h t o 300 ppm [549 mg/m 3] ethylene 
oxide (Walker et al ., 1990, 1992a). The second-order rate constants ob tained for the 
binding of ethylene oxide to amino acid residues in haemoglo bin are similar to those pub-
lished by Segerbäck (1990). According to the model,  total adduct formation in haemo-
globin and DNA accounted for 0.25% and 0.001% of the  inhaled dose, respectively. After 
exposure to atmospheric concentrations of up to 500  ppm [915 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide, 
the model predicted first-order kinetics for whole- body elimination, but non-linearity in 
individual metabolic pathways and exhalation. Compariso n of the predictions for low and 
500-ppm exposures indicated that the share of GSH c onjugation decreased from 38 to 
27%, whereas the share of hydrolysis increased from  31 to 36% and that of exhalation 
from 23 to 28% (Krishnan et al ., 1992). 
More recent physiologically based pharmacokinetic m odels of uptake and metabolism 
of ethylene oxide in mice, rats and humans were pub lished by Csanády et al . (2000) and 
Fennell and Brown (2001). These models predicted ad equately blood and tissue concen-
trations of ethylene oxide in rats and mice (with t he exception of the testes). Simulations 
by the model of Fennell and Brown (2001) indicate t hat, in mice, rats and humans, about 254 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 80%, 60% and 20% of ethylene oxide, respectively, w ould be metabolized via GSH con-
jugation. Nevertheless, modelling 6-h inhalation expos ures gave simulated ethylene oxide 
areas under the curve and blood peak concentrations  that were similar for mice, rats and 
humans (Fennell & Brown, 2001). Thus, exposure to a  given concentration of ethylene 
oxide in air results in similar predicted blood eth ylene oxide areas under the curve for 
mice, rats and humans.  
4.1.3  Comparison of rodent and human data 
A striking difference between rodents and humans in  the metabolism of ethylene 
oxide is the predominance of the GSH pathway in mice and rat s, while in humans (and in 
other larger animals tested to date), the pathway i nitiated by enzymatic and non-enzym-
atic hydrolysis is of greater importance (Jones & W ells, 1981; Martis et al. , 1982; Gérin 
& Tardif, 1986; Tardif et al. , 1987; Brown et al. , 1996) which is consistent with the 
observed levels of the ethylene oxide that conjugat e GSTT1 in the order mice > rats > 
humans. This leads to an onset of significant GSH d epletion in rodents at exposure 
concentrations that were used in toxicological inve stigations, namely between 33 and 
100 ppm [60.4 and 183 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide in ambient air (see above). Howeve r, it is 
important to note that carcinogenicity in rats was already observed at the lower exposure 
concentration of 10 ppm [18.3 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide in one study (see Section 3).  
Although the physiologically based pharmacokinetic models constructed by Fennell 
and Brown (2001) indicated profound differences in the relative contribution of the 
different metabolic pathways, when differences in u ptake and metabolism are taken into 
account, simulated blood peak concentrations and ar eas under the curve were similar for 
mice, rats and humans (human levels within about 15 % of rat and mouse levels). Thus, 
exposure to a given concentration of ethylene oxide  in air gives similar predicted blood 
levels of ethylene oxide and areas under the curve for mice , rats and humans (in the range 
of exposures used in the rodent cancer bioassays, i .e. 100 ppm [183 mg/m 3] and below; 
above these concentrations, the differences in GSH depletion may be expected to lead to 
significant differences in the levels of ethylene o xide in blood with comparable concen-
trations in the ambient air).  
Human erythrocytes are rich (but polymorphic) in th e ethylene oxide-metabolizing 
enzyme GSTT1, but, in the experimental animals inve stigated, this protective enzyme is 
not present in the erythrocytes (Hallier et al. , 1993). This adds a further complexity to 
species differences in the metabolism of ethylene o xide. 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
The direct reaction of ethylene oxide with DNA is t hought to initiate the cascade of 
genetic and related events that lead to cancer (Swe nberg et al ., 1990). Ethylene oxide is a 
direct alkylating agent and reacts with nucleophile s without the need for metabolic trans-
formation. It uses the general S N2 mechanism and has a high Swain-Scott substrate  ETHYLENE OXIDE 255  
 
 constant (Golberg, 1986), both of which favour effi cient N7-alkylation of guanine (and 
other ring nitrogens to a lesser extent) due to the  electron density distribution of purines 
and the steric availability of the N7-position of guanine (Kolman et al ., 2002). The 
reactivity of this agent is due to the strain of th e oxirane ring and the partial positive 
charge on the carbon atoms, which give the compound  its electrophilic character and 
predispose the ring to open and form a hydroxyethyl carbonium ion (Golberg, 1986). 
Several published reviews contain details of earlie r studies of the reactivity and genetic 
toxicity of ethylene oxide in humans and experiment al systems (Kolman et al ., 1986; 
Dellarco et al ., 1990; Walker et al ., 1990; IARC, 1994; Natarajan et al ., 1995; Health 
Canada, 1999; Preston, 1999; Thier & Bolt, 2000; He alth Canada, 2001; Kolman et al ., 
2002; WHO, 2003). This update is focused primarily upon recently published in-vivo 
studies of ethylene oxide-exposed humans and rodent  models that shed light on the mode 
of action and the extent to which species compariso ns may be pertinent to an evaluation 
of the carcinogenicity of this chemical in humans.  
4.2.1  Humans 
(a) DNA adducts 
For nearly 20 years, it has been known that the endoge nous formation of ethylene and 
its conversion to ethylene oxide leads to 2-hydroxy ethylation of DNA to yield back-
ground levels of N7-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine (7-HEG) in unexposed huma ns (reviewed 
in Bolt, 1996; Farmer & Shuker, 1999; Walker et al ., 2000; Marsden et al ., 2007). 
Ethylene is generated in vivo  during normal physiological processes such as lipi d per-
oxidation, oxidation of methionine, oxidation of ha eme in haemoglobin and/or through 
the metabolizing activity of intestinal bacteria (r eviewed in Thier & Bolt, 2000). Walker 
et al.  (2000) described a series of studies of background  levels of these adducts in 
different tissues of unexposed humans, and showed t hat lower endogenous levels of 
7-HEG have typically been found with more sensitive  detection methods than those 
employed in reports on the impact of endogenously v ersus exogenously derived ethylene 
oxide (Bolt, 1996). Farmer and Shuker (1999) sugges ted that, in order to estimate the 
increase in cancer risk attributable to a given ext ernal exposure, it is clearly important to 
establish and consider background levels of corresponding  DNA damage so that the scale 
of the incremental increase can be calculated. It i s mainly for this reason that more 
sensitive and specific analytical methods have been  developed for the measurement of 
background and treatment-induced levels of 7-HEG th an for any other single DNA 
adduct (reviewed in Zhao et al. , 1999; Liao  et al. , 2001; Kao & Giese, 2005). 
Since endogenous DNA damage through lipid peroxidat ion is thought to contribute 
significantly to cancer in humans (Marnett, 2002), Zhao and Hemminki (2002) investi-
gated the association between age and endogenous fo rmation of 7-HEG in 34 younger 
and older healthy human subjects (mean ages, 39.8 a nd 82.8 years, respectively). Steady-
state levels of 7-HEG in the DNA of peripheral bloo d lymphocytes were similar in the 
younger and older subjects (means, 3.8 ± 3.4 and 3.0 ± 2.7 adducts/10 7 nucleotides, 256 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 respectively), which suggests that endogenous DNA damage b y ethylene oxide that arises 
from ethylene generated by lipid peroxidation and t he repair of such damage is in-
dependent of age as a contributing factor to cancer  risk. 
A single study has been performed to examine the fo rmation of 7-HEG in humans 
exposed to ethylene oxide in the workplace (Yong et al ., 2007). 7-HEG was quantified, 
using the method of Kao and Giese (2005), in periph eral blood granulocytes from 58 
hospital workers exposed to ethylene oxide during t he unloading of sterilizers or when 
working adjacent to sterilizers. Cumulative exposur e to ethylene oxide (ppm–h) was 
estimated during the 4-month period before the coll ection of blood samples. There was 
considerable interindividual variation in the level s of 7-HEG in both unexposed control 
and ethylene oxide-exposed workers, ranging from 1. 6 to 241 adducts/10 7 nucleotides. 
The mean levels in the unexposed, low-ethylene oxid e exposure (< 32 ppm–h) 
[58.6 mg/m 3–h] and high-ethylene oxide exposure (> 32 ppm–h) g roups were 3.8, 16.3 
and 20.3 adducts/10 7 nucleotides, respectively, but the differences wer e not statistically 
significant after adjustment for cigarette smoking and other potential confounders. Since 
the life-span of granulocytes is less than 1 day co mpared with a life-span of up to several 
years for lymphocytes, the large inter-individual v ariation in 7-HEG levels as well as 
elevated values in individual ethylene oxide-expose d workers may have reflected very 
recent transient peak exposures that were not captu red in the overall 4-month cumulative 
exposure estimates. 
(b) Mutations and other genetic related effects (see also Table 10)  
Studies of human exposures to ethylene oxide have f ocused upon individuals who 
were employed in the operation of hospital or facto ry sterilization units and workers who 
were involved in ethylene oxide manufacturing or pr ocessing. Selected studies showed 
that exposure to ethylene oxide results in chromoso mal alterations that are related to both 
the level and duration of exposure, while a single study suggested that exposure to 
ethylene oxide causes gene mutations. Several other  biomarkers of DNA damage (un-
scheduled DNA synthesis, DNA single-strand breaks, premature centromere division and 
DNA–protein cross-links) have been studied by only a few investigators; results are 
summarized at the end of this section. 
Preston (1999) provided a critical assessment of th e cytogenetic effects of ethylene 
oxide in vitro  and in vivo , discussed the basic guidelines for cytogenetic as says in 
population monitoring and hazard identification, an d exhaustively reviewed reports of 
human cytogenetic studies of ethylene oxide through  to 1996. Occupational exposures to 
ethylene oxide have resulted in increased levels of  chromosomal events, which included 
sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus formation in 
blood cells. Cytogenetic end-points can serve as ma rkers of exposure to ethylene oxide 
and DNA damage. Moreover, several large prospective  studies have demonstrated that, 
on a population basis, increased levels of chromoso mal aberration or micronucleus for-
mation are indicative of an increased risk for canc er development (Hagmar et al. , 1998;  ETHYLENE OXIDE 257

Bonassi et al. , 2007).  
The induction of increased frequencies of sister ch romatid exchange has been found 
to be a sensitive indicator of genotoxic exposure t o ethylene oxide in humans (Tates et al. , 
1991). Evaluation of the impact of exposure to ethy lene oxide on changes in the fre-
quency of sister chromatid exchange should take int o consideration the observation that 
the available studies assessed a wide range of expo sure concentrations and conditions, 
including moderately high-dose acute exposures and chronic exposures at varying con-
centrations of ethylene oxide. Some interesting tre nds are apparent across studies. Those 
that failed to find significant increases in freque ncies of sister chromatid exchange 
following exposure to ethylene oxide were primarily  studies of workers who were 
exposed to approximately 5 ppm [9.15 mg/m 3] or less (TWA) (Högstedt et al. , 1983; 
Yager et al. , 1983; Hansen et al. , 1984; Stolley et al. , 1984; Sarto et al. , 1991; Tates et al. , 
1995), although a number of studies report increase d frequencies of sister chromatid ex-
change in workers exposed to less than 5 ppm (TWA) (Sarto et al. , 1984a, 1987; Mayer et 
al. , 1991; Tates et al. , 1991; Schulte et al ., 1992, 1995). Significant increases in frequen-
cies of sister chromatid exchange were commonly fou nd in studies that evaluated indi-
viduals who were exposed to concentrations of ethyl ene oxide > 5 ppm (TWA) (Garry et 
al. , 1979; Yager et al. , 1983; Laurent et al., 1984; Sarto et al. , 1984a; Stolley et al. , 1984; 
Tates et al. , 1991; Lerda & Rizzi, 1992; Schulte et al. , 1992). It should be noted that 
comparisons among studies are complicated by differ ences in the methodology used to 
record and report exposure concentrations of ethyle ne oxide; this problem is further 
complicated by the fact that, although workers were  generally exposed to low average 
levels in some studies, acute high exposures were n oted to have occurred (Tates et al. , 
1991). In spite of these complications, several stu dies found significant differences in 
sister chromatid exchange frequencies in individual s and/or groups exposed to levels of 
ethylene oxide higher than the designated low-expos ure group from the same or similar 
environment (Yager et al. , 1983; Sarto et al. , 1984a; Stolley et al. , 1984; Tates et al. , 
1991; Schulte et al. , 1992). These findings support the observation tha t sister chromatid 
exchange frequencies varied with level and frequency of exposure to ethylene oxide. Two 
studies investigated changes in frequencies of sist er chromatid exchange over time and 
found that they remained elevated for at least 6 mo nths even when exposures were de-
creased or ceased after the first assessment (Sarto  et al. , 1984b; Stolley et al. , 1984). A 
relationship between changes in frequencies of sist er chromatid exchange and cigarette 
smoking has also been found by several investigators (Sarto  et al. , 1991); because data on 
exposure to cigarette smoke as a potential confound ing factor was not consistently 
included in all studies, it is not always possible to determine the primary cause for the 
observed changes in sister chromatid exchange frequ ency (Sarto et al. , 1991).  
Because increased frequencies of some classes of ch romosomal aberration are asso-
ciated with an increased risk for the development o f cancer (Sorsa et al. , 1990), several 
studies have investigated the induction of increase d frequencies of chromosomal 
aberrations in individuals exposed to ethylene oxid e. Workers exposed to a range of  ETHYLENE OXIDE 261  
 
 concentrations from 0.01 ppm to 200 ppm [0.02–366 m g/m 3] have been evaluated; the 
majority of the studies found significant increases  in chromosomal aberrations (Pero 
et al. , 1981; Högstedt et al. , 1983; Sarto et al. , 1984b; Richmond et al. , 1985; Galloway 
et al. , 1986; Karelová et al. , 1987; Högstedt et al. , 1990; Tates et al. , 1991; Lerda & 
Rizzi, 1992; Ribeiro et al. , 1994; Major et al. , 1996). One study found significant 
increases in chromosomal aberrations in individuals  exposed to concentrations of 
ethylene oxide of approximately 1 ppm [1.83 mg/m 3] and below (Högstedt et al. , 1983), 
although the majority of positive studies evaluated  exposure conditions in which higher 
concentrations of ethylene oxide were present. Othe r studies of workers exposed to 
concentrations of ethylene oxide of approximately 1  ppm [1.83 mg/m 3] TWA and below 
did not find evidence of increased chromosomal aber rations (van Sittert et al. , 1985; 
Mayer et al. , 1991). Chromosomal aberration frequencies have be en found to correlate 
with exposure concentrations of ethylene oxide and/ or duration of exposure (Clare et al. , 
1985; Galloway et al. , 1986; Tates et al. , 1991; Lerda & Rizzi, 1992). As noted for 
studies of sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal a berrations can be influenced by 
concurrent exposure to cigarette smoke and by agein g; these factors, combined with 
differences in the methods used to determine the ma gnitude of the exposures to ethylene 
oxide, limit the conclusions that can be drawn from  comparisons between studies 
(Preston, 1999). As reported for sister chromatid e xchange, the validity of these 
comparisons is supported by the observation that so me investigators found significant 
increases in chromosomal aberrations in high-dose g roups but not in low-dose groups 
exposed in the same or similar environments (Sarto et al. , 1984b; Galloway et al. , 1986).  
Fewer investigators have evaluated the impact of ex posure to ethylene oxide on the 
frequencies of micronucleated cells, and comparison s are therefore limited for this cyto-
genetic marker. The available studies showed a comb ination of positive and negative 
effects. Högstedt et al.  (1990) and Ribeiro et al.  (1994) found increased frequencies of 
micronucleated lymphocytes in workers while Tates et al.  (1991) found significant 
increases in micronucleus frequencies in workers ex posed to high but not to low doses. 
Exposure concentrations in all of these studies var ied, but ranged from < 1 ppm to 
400 ppm [1.83–732 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide. Studies that evaluated individual s exposed to 
levels of ethylene oxide ≤ 1 ppm gave negative results (Högstedt et al. , 1983; Sarto et al. , 
1990, 1991; Tates et al. , 1995). 
Two studies determined micronucleus frequencies in tissues other than lymphocytes. 
Ribeiro et al.  (1994) evaluated both peripheral blood lymphocytes  and exfoliated buccal 
cells in individuals exposed to 2–5 ppm [3.66–9.15 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide (TWA); 
micronucleus frequencies in buccal cells had a nega tive association while lymphocytes 
had a significantly positive association with the e ffects of ethylene oxide. Sarto et al.  
(1990) found significant increases in micronucleus frequencies in nasal mucosal cells but 
not in exfoliated buccal cells of workers exposed t o ethylene oxide at concentrations 
below 0.38 ppm [0.7 mg/m 3] (TWA) (some workers experienced acute exposure to  
ethylene). Exposure to cigarette smoke and age were  not discussed as potential con-
founders in these studies. These mixed results led to the conclusion by Tates et al.  (1991) 262 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 that the relative sensitivity of end-points for the detecti on of exposure to ethylene oxide in 
humans was in the following order: haemoglobin addu cts > sister chromatid exchange > 
chromosomal aberrations > micronucleus formation > hypoxanthine–guanine phosphori-
bosyl transferase gene ( HPRT ) mutants. However, HPRT  mutation is a marker of heri-
table DNA change and thus should not be expected to  be sensitive as an indicator of 
exposure. 
Several studies reported individual differences in the magnitude of response for one 
or more biomarkers that were not accounted for by adjusting f or known confounders such 
as smoking or age (Laurent et al. , 1984; Sarto et al. , 1984a). Yong et al.  (2001) evaluated 
the relationship between levels of haemoglobin addu cts, sister chromatid exchange 
frequencies and GSTT1  genotype and found that individuals who had the nu ll GSTT1  
genotype had significantly higher levels of haemoglo bin adducts and lower frequencies of 
sister chromatid exchange than individuals who had at least one positive allele. Because 
these findings were made after most of the above re ports, the impact of individual geno-
type upon the markers listed above is not known. Th e results of Yong et al.  (2001) 
suggest that studies that found significant variati ons between individuals may have 
detected the impact of GSTT1  genotype upon the study end-points, and support th e need 
to consider genotype in future studies of ethylene oxide-induced effects.  
Only three reports have addressed the issue of whet her occupational exposure to 
ethylene oxide is associated with the induction of gene mutations. In the first study, the 
T-cell cloning assay was used to measure HPRT  mutant frequencies in peripheral blood 
lymphocytes from nine ethylene oxide-exposed hospit al workers and 15 ethylene oxide-
exposed factory workers (Tates et al. , 1991). Hospital workers included nurses and tech-
nicians who were involved in the sterilization of m edical equipment and were exposed to 
ethylene oxide once or twice a week for about 10 mi n. The concentrations of ethylene 
oxide ranged from 20 to 25 ppm [36.6–45.8 mg/m 3] in the sterilization room and from 22 
to 72 ppm [40.3.–131.8 mg/m 3] in front of the sterilizer immediately after open ing (as 
measured by GC). The hospital workers were matched for age, sex and smoking habits 
with a control group of eight unexposed administrat ive workers. The factory workers 
were employed at a plant that was involved in the p roduction of ethylene oxide-sterilized 
disposable medical equipment, and were similarly matche d with a group of 15 unexposed 
controls in the same factory. During a 4-month moni toring period (equivalent to the life-
span of erythrocytes in humans), five workers were engaged in ‘daily’ sterilization 
activities, two workers were involved in ‘daily’ st erilization except for leave periods of 7 
or 11 days and eight remaining workers were ‘occasi onally’ exposed to ethylene oxide 
during exposure control, packing and quality contro l of sterilized products. Before the 
collection of samples in early 1990, the mean durat ion of exposure of factory workers was 
12 years (range, 3–27 years), with average ambient exposure levels from 1989 onwards 
that were estimated to be about 17 ppm [ ∼31 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide. Based on measure-
ments  of N-(2-hydroxyethy)valine haemoglobin adducts that int egrate exposure over 
time, average exposures to ethylene oxide in the 4 months before blood sampling were  ETHYLENE OXIDE 263  
 
 estimated to be a 40-h TWA of 0.025 ppm [0.046 mg/m 3] for hospital workers and 5 ppm 
[9.15 mg/m 3] for factory workers (Tates et al.  1991).  
The average HPRT  mutant frequencies in hospital workers (12.4 ± 9.9 × 10 –6) and 
factory workers (13.8 ± 4.4 × 10 –6) were remarkably similar and showed increases of 5 5% 
and 60%, respectively, above background in their re spective control groups (8.0 ± 3.6 × 
10 –6 and 8.6 ± 4.4 × 10 –6); however, the mutagenic response was significantl y elevated 
only in the factory workers. Tates et al.  (1991) suggested that the statistically significan t 
increase in the mutant frequency in the factory wor kers, and not the hospital workers, may 
have been due to some extent to the larger study po pulations of factory workers and their 
controls, but the investigators concluded that the difference was more probably due to the 
higher exposure concentrations and tissue doses of ethylene oxide in factory workers. The 
mean cloning efficiency was uniformly lower in the exposed  factory workers than in their 
control group (as well as the hospital workers expo sed and their control groups), which 
might exaggerate the effect of exposure to ethylene  oxide on HPRT  mutant frequency in 
factory workers; however, adjustments (using multip licative and additive models) for the 
observed effect of cloning efficiency, age and smoking stat us in factory workers appeared 
to justify the conclusion that the increased HPRT  mutant frequency in this group was due 
to exposure to ethylene oxide. [While the Working G roup recognized the importance of 
this study, it also noted inconsistencies in the re sults with regard to the response in 
relation to the exposure concentrations and duratio n of exposure, as well as the apparent 
similarity of the mutational spectrum of the expose d group and that of control 
populations.] 
In a follow-up study of workers in an ethylene oxid e production plant, Tates et al.  
(1995) again used the T-cell cloning assay to measu re HPRT  mutant frequencies in three 
exposed and one unexposed groups (seven subjects pe r group). Group I workers were 
incidentally exposed to acute high concentrations o f ethylene oxide, while group II and III 
workers were chronically exposed to low concentrati ons of ethylene oxide for < 5 years 
and > 15 years, respectively. No significant differ ences in mutant frequencies were 
observed between any combination of worker or contr ol groups, which implies that 
incidental exposure to high levels of ethylene oxid e (28−429 ppm [52–785 mg/m 3]) or 
chronic exposure to low concentrations of ethylene oxide (< 0.005−0.02 ppm [< 0.01–
0.04 mg/m 3]) did not cause any measurable permanent gene muta tions in lymphocytes. 
A few investigations extended the number of biomark ers evaluated to characterize 
ethylene oxide-induced effects to include unschedul ed DNA synthesis and induction of 
DNA single-strand breaks, premature centromere divi sion and DNA–protein cross-links. 
Induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis was decrease d compared with controls in 
workers exposed to a range of concentrations of eth ylene oxide that included levels below 
1 ppm [mg/m 3] (TWA) (Pero et al. , 1981; Sarto et al. , 1987; Mayer et al. , 1991); the 
significance of this finding was not clear, but one  investigator considered the decrease to 
reflect diminished DNA repair capacity (Pero et al. , 1981). DNA single-strand breaks 
were not found to be increased in ethylene oxide-exposed wor kers in one study (Mayer et 
al. , 1991), but were shown to be increased by alkaline  elution in peripheral blood 264 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 mononuclear cells from hospital and factory workers  occupied in sterilizing medical 
devices (Fuchs et al. , 1994). In nonsmokers, significantly higher elutio n was observed in 
ethylene oxide-exposed workers than controls, with remarkable individual differences in 
susceptibility according to GSTT1  polymorphism. In smokers, a similar trend was ob-
served in ethylene oxide-exposed subjects but the r esponse was smaller and non-
significant. Only one study evaluated premature cen tromere division as a potential 
indicator of genomic instability (Major et al ., 1999); an increase in this phenomenon was 
observed in ethylene oxide-exposed subjects that co rrelated with increased chromosomal 
aberrations. Another study measured DNA–protein cross-l inks by alkaline filter elution in 
hospital workers and found a significant correlatio n between reduced elution rates and 
exposure to ethylene oxide (Popp et al. , 1994). 
4.2.2  Experimental systems  
(a) DNA adducts 
The relative amounts of adducts found in two indepe ndent studies of the reactivity of 
ethylene oxide with double-stranded DNA in vitro  (Segerbäck, 1990; Li et al. , 1992) are 
compared in tables in Segerbäck (1994) and Kolman et al.  (2002). In vitro , the reaction of 
ethylene oxide with nucleic acids occurs mainly at ring nitrogens, and leads to the for-
mation of 7-HEG, O6-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine ( O6-HEG) and reaction products with N1, 
N3, N7 and N6 of adenine and N3 of cytosine, uracil and thymine. Depending upon th e in-
vitro study, 7-HEG accounted for up to 90% of alkyl ation products and smaller amounts 
of other DNA adducts were formed. Segerbäck (1990) reported that treatment of calf 
thymus DNA with 14 C-labelled ethylene oxide resulted in the formation  of 7-HEG, N3-(2-
hydroxyethyl)adenine (3-HEA) and O6-HEG at a ratio of 100:4.4:0.5. In contrast, Walker  
et al.  (1992b) found that the ratio of the steady-state c oncentrations of 7-HEG, 3-HEA 
and O6-HEG was 100:0.3:0.4 following repeated exposures o f rats to ethylene oxide, 
which indicates that 3-HEA and O6-HEG do not accumulate in vivo  at levels predicted by 
the in-vitro ratios of these adducts and 7-HEG. 
Many studies have evaluated DNA adducts as a molecular dosi meter following single 
or repeated exposures of mice and rats to ethylene oxide by intraperitoneal injection or 
inhalation. 7-HEG has consistently been found to be  the predominant adduct; relatively 
small amounts of O6-HEG and 3-HEA were identified in a single investig ation of in-vivo 
adduct formation in tissues of ethylene oxide-expos ed rats (Walker et al. , 1992b). Time-
course studies have demonstrated that 7-HEG accumul ated at steady-state levels after 4 
weeks of inhalation exposure of mice and rats to hi gh concentrations of ethylene oxide 
(100 ppm [183 mg/m 3] in mice and 100 or 300 ppm [183 or 549 mg/m 3] in rats) for 6 h 
per day on 5 days per week (Walker et al. , 1990, 1992b; Rusyn et al. , 2005); in contrast, 
adducts reached a plateau after 1 week of exposure during in-vivo conversion of 
exogenous ethylene to low levels of ethylene oxide (~ 6 ppm [ ∼11 mg/m 3]) in most tissues 
of mice and rats exposed to 3000 ppm ethylene by in halation 6 h per day on 5 days per 
week for 4 weeks (Walker et al. , 2000; Rusyn et al. , 2005). These data support the  ETHYLENE OXIDE 265  
 
 hypothesis that, after repeated exposures of rodent s to high concentrations of ethylene 
oxide, the discrepancies between the time to steady  state (i.e. ≥ 28 days) and the DNA 
adduct half-life values [cited in the previous revi ew of ethylene oxide (IARC, 1994); i.e. 
half-life of 1.0−2.3 days in most mouse tissues and  2.9−4.8 days in most rat tissues 
(Walker et al. , 1992b)] were most probably related to a greater d ependence on spon-
taneous depurination for loss of 7-HEG than at lowe r levels of exposures to ethylene 
oxide at which DNA repair is not saturated (Walker et al. , 2000). In contrast, the patterns 
of elimination of 7-HEG adducts after a single 6-h exposure of rats to 40 or 3000 ppm 
ethylene exhibited slow linear loss of adducts from  the brain, liver and spleen in animals 
exposed to endogeneously formed low-level ethylene oxide equivalents of ~1−6 ppm 
[1.83–11 mg/m 3] (Rusyn et al. , 2005).  
Dose–response studies in mice and rats exposed to 3 , 10, 33 or 100 ppm [5.49, 18.3, 
60.4 or 183 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide for 6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 4 weeks 
showed that the formation of 7-HEG at any given exp osure level was similar for all 
tissues (brain, liver, lung, spleen) except the testis (wit hin a factor of three) (Walker et al. , 
1992b; Wu et al. , 1999a; Rusyn et al. , 2005), which suggests that, since not all of thes e 
tissues are targets for cancer, other critical fact ors may be involved in the species and 
tissue specificity for tumour induction by this che mical (Walker et al. , 1992b). 
Nevertheless, in rats exposed by inhalation for 6 h  per day on 5 days per week for 
4 weeks to 0, 50, 100 or 200 ppm [0, 91.5, 183 or 366 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide, statistically 
significant linear relationships were found between  mean levels of 7-HEG and increases 
in Hprt  mutant frequencies and between 7-HEG and elevation s in sister chromatid 
exchange or so-called high-frequency cells (van Sit tert et al. , 2000). Similar relationships 
between levels of 7-HEG and Hprt  mutant frequencies were observed in mice exposed f or 
4 weeks to the same concentrations of ethylene oxid e, except that the dose–response 
curves were sublinear and showed a greater effect p er unit dose for both biomarkers with 
increasing exposure (see Fig. 4 in Walker et al. , 1997a). Thus, while levels of ethylene 
oxide-induced 7-HEG do not correlate directly with species/tissue susceptibility, they 
appear to predict the occurrence of increased frequ encies of gene mutations and sister 
chromatid exchange in the lymphocytes of ethylene o xide-exposed rodents. 
Background levels of 7-HEG in mice and rats have be en investigated in numerous 
reports on the validation of sensitive methods to m easure this adduct and/or establish the 
relative contribution of DNA damage that arises fro m endogenously and exogenously 
derived ethylene oxide (Föst et al. , 1989; Walker et al. , 1992b; Eide et al. , 1999; Wu 
et al. , 1999a,b; Zhao et al. , 1999; van Sittert et al. , 2000; Walker et al. , 2000; Rusyn et al. , 
2005; Marsden et al. , 2007). Most recently, Marsden et al.  (2007) developed a highly 
sensitive LC–MS/MS assay with selected reaction mon itoring and established the lowest 
background levels of 7-HEG (1.1−3.5 adducts/10 8 nucleotides) reported to date for 
multiple tissues (colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung , spleen and stomach) in male Fischer 
344 rats, which corroborated and extended an earlie r report of ∼2.6 7-HEG adducts/10 8 
nucleotides in liver DNA from unexposed male Lewis rats (van Sittert et al. , 2000). 
Marsden et al.  (2007) also measured exogenously derived 7-HEG fol lowing intra-266 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 peritoneal administration of a single dose or three  daily doses of 0.01–1.0 mg/kg ethylene 
oxide. These relatively low doses resulted in modes t but generally dose-related increases 
in the observed concentrations of 7-HEG (i.e. backg round levels from endogenous 
ethylene oxide plus levels from exogenous ethylene oxide) in various tissues, except at 
the lowest concentration for which the measured amoun ts of 7-HEG in various tissues did 
not differ from those detected in control animals. The latter finding indicates that any 
increase in 7-HEG was negligible compared with the endogenous DNA damage already 
present. 
(b) Mutations and other genetic effects (see Table 11 for details and 
references)  
As a direct-acting alkylating agent, ethylene oxide  has displayed genotoxic activity in 
nearly all studies in experimental systems, with a few notable dose-related exceptions in 
ethylene oxide-exposed rodents. In vitro , ethylene oxide caused DNA damage and gene 
mutations in bacteriophage, bacteria, fungi, insect s and mammalian cells, and gene 
conversion in yeast (IARC, 1994). Given the general  consistency of the in-vitro data in 
Table 11, only studies conducted in in-vivo systems  are detailed here.  
In-vivo exposure to ethylene oxide induced DNA dama ge and heritable mutations in 
germ cells of rodents, which caused alkali-labile s ites and single-strand breaks in mouse 
sperm and spermatids, and chromosomal aberrations i n mouse spermatocytes. It also 
induced dominant lethal effects in mice and rats, a nd heritable translocations in mice. 
Reviews of these studies have been published (Health Cana da, 1999, 2001; WHO, 2003). 
It should be noted that these (mostly dose-related) effect s were observed at relatively high 
concentrations of ethylene oxide (165–300 ppm [302– 549 mg/m 3]; lower doses not 
tested) that exceeded the high dose used in the rod ent carcinogenicity studies of this 
chemical. 
Results of in-vivo gene mutation studies in rodents  have given consistently positive 
results following ingestion, injection or inhalatio n of ethylene oxide. The in-vivo 
mutagenicity of ethylene oxide at the Hprt  locus of somatic cells was demonstrated 
following intraperitoneal injection and after repea ted inhalation exposures of mice. The 
impact of age-dependent trafficking on the ‘manifes tation’ of mutant T-cells in rodents 
was taken into consideration in designing the Hprt  mutation studies (Walker et al. , 1999). 
In young adult male lacI  transgenic mice of B6C3F 1 origin, inhalation exposures for 
4 weeks to ethylene oxide resulted in significant non-line ar increases in the frequencies of 
Hprt  mutations in splenic T cells. The average induced mutant frequencies (i.e. the 
average observed mutant frequency after treatment minu s the average background mutant 
frequency) following exposures to 50, 100 or 200 ppm [91.5, 1 83 or 366 mg/m 3] ethylene 
oxide were 1.6, 4.6 and 11.9 × 10 –6; greater relative mutagenic efficiencies (mutations pe r 
unit dose) were observed at higher than at lower co ncentrations. The small but significant 
mutagenic response induced at 50 ppm ethylene oxide  (the low-dose concentration in the 
carcinogenicity bioassay in mice) was only 73% abov e the average control animal value 
of 2.2 ± 0.3 × 10 –6 ( p = 0.009). In a follow-up study of rodents exposed for 4 weeks to  ETHYLENE OXIDE 267

 0 or 200 ppm [366 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide, Hprt mutant frequency measurements in 
splenic T cells of young adult male Fischer 344 rat s and B6C3F 1 mice were significantly 
increased by five- to sixfold over background (1.7 and 1.3  × 10 –6 in control mice and rats, 
respectively).  
Ethylene oxide-induced mutagenesis at the Hprt  locus in splenic T cells of rats was 
confirmed in two additional investigations in young  adult male Lewis rats exposed to 
ethylene oxide by single intraperitoneal injection,  in the drinking-water or by inhalation. 
Significant mutagenic effects were observed by all three routes of exposure; plots of the 
mutagenicity data against blood dose (estimated fro m haemoglobin adducts) were a 
common denominator, which showed that, at equal blo od doses, injection of ethylene 
oxide led to higher mutant frequencies than treatme nt in the drinking-water, which was 
more mutagenic than exposure via inhalation. In a follow- up study of inhalation exposure 
of male Lewis rats to the same concentrations of et hylene oxide, modest dose-related 
increases in Hprt  mutant frequencies were found but the only signifi cant elevation was in 
the group exposed to the highest dose of ethylene o xide. The results of these studies of 
Hprt  gene mutation led to the conclusion that ethylene oxide is only weakly mutagenic in 
adult rats. 
Ethylene oxide-induced gene mutations have been demon strated in multiple tissues of 
LacI  transgenic mice. Following 4 weeks of inhalation exposure  of male Big Blue  mice 
to ethylene oxide, the frequencies of LacI  gene mutations in exposed animals were sig-
nificantly increased over control values in lung but not bon e marrow or spleen. When Big 
Blue mice were exposed to ethylene oxide for 12, 24  and 48 weeks, clear dose-related 
mutagenic responses in bone marrow were observed on ly after 48 weeks of exposure, 
with LacI mutant frequencies significantly increased only in the 100- and 200-ppm [183- 
and 366-mg/m 3] exposure groups. In testes of the same mice, dose -related increases in 
mutant frequencies were found in the groups exposed  to 25, 50 or 100 ppm [45.8, 91.5 or 
183 mg/m 3] but not the group exposed to 200 ppm [366 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide. 
Recent assessments of the carcinogenicity of ethyle ne oxide have included 
discussions and summary tables of the results from many studies on chromosomal effects 
in ethylene oxide-exposed humans (Health Canada, 19 99, 2001; WHO, 2003), but no 
critical review of cytogenetic studies in ethylene oxide-exposed rodents has been made 
since 1990 (Dellarco et al. , 1990). Several studies have shown that repeated e xposures of 
rats to levels equal to or greater than those used in rodent carcinogenicity studies of 
ethylene oxide (> 50 ppm [> 91.5 mg/m 3]) induced dose-related increases in sister chro-
matid exchange. Treatment of rats and mice with hig h acute doses of ethylene oxide by 
intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or orally (i.e. routes of exposure that are less 
relevant to humans) also caused increases in the fr equencies of micronucleus formation 
and chromosomal aberrations. 
In contrast, following inhalation exposure (i.e. a route of exposure relevant to 
humans), only concentrations of ethylene oxide that exceed ed those used in rodent cancer 
bioassays induced micronucleus formation or chromos omal aberrations in mice and rats. 
Modest but significant increases in bone marrow mic ronuclei were observed in male 274 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F 1 mice following 4 weeks of exposure for 6 h per day  on 5 
days per week to 200 ppm [366 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide, but not to 40, 1000 or 3000 ppm 
exogenous ethylene which is converted in vivo  to about 1–6 ppm [1.83–11 mg/m 3] 
ethylene oxide (Vergnes & Pritts, 1994). In contras t, no increases in the frequencies of 
chromosomal aberrations or micronucleus formation w ere found in peripheral 
blood/splenic lymphocytes from rats exposed to ethy lene oxide. Furthermore, another 
study showed that 4 weeks of exposure of rats to et hylene oxide failed to cause an 
increase in translocations (e.g. the percentage of translocations in controls and rats treated 
with 200 ppm [366 mg/m 3] was 0.1% and 0.09%, respectively). [The Working G roup 
noted, however, that strong conclusions cannot be d rawn about the clastogenic potential 
of the ethylene oxide treatment regimen used in the  4-week inhalation study (van Sittert et 
al. , 2000; Lorenti Garcia et al. , 2001) because cytogenetic studies were initiated 5 days 
after the final day of exposure, a suboptimal time, and the po wer of the fluorescent in-situ 
hybridization studies were limited by analysis of o nly a single chromosome and the small 
numbers of rats per group examined.] In studies of the potential clastogenicity of styrene, 
a group of rats exposed to 150 ppm [274.5 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide by inhalation for 6 h 
per day on 5 days per week for 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks w as included based upon the expec-
tation that, with appropriate sampling times shortly afte r exposure, a positive response for 
chromosomal aberrations would be produced in lympho cytes of ethylene oxide-exposed 
animals. However, the frequency of chromosomal aber rations in ethylene oxide-exposed 
rats was not increased over that in air controls at  any sampling time. 
(c) Mutational spectra 
Walker and Skopek (1993) reported limited data on m utational spectra for Hprt  
mutant T-cell clones from B6C3F 1 mice given repeated intraperioneal injections of 
ethylene oxide. Molecular analyses using polymerase  chain reaction-based denaturing 
gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing for mut ations in the exon 3 region of Hprt  
suggested the involvement of both modified guanine an d adenine bases in ethylene oxide-
induced mutagenesis. Additional data  on Hprt  gene mutational spectra were presented in 
a preliminary report following 4-week inhalation ex posures of mice to 0, 50, 100 or 
200 ppm [0, 91.5, 183 or 366 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide or rats to 0 or 200 ppm [366 mg/m 3] 
ethylene oxide for 6 h per day on 5 days per week ( Walker et al. , 1997b). The types of 
mutation in ethylene oxide-exposed mice or rats wer e independent of the route of ex-
posure; these mutations included a combination of b ase substitutions, frameshifts and 
small deletions; the most common lesions were a +1G in a run o f six guanines (base pairs 
207–212) and several different small deletions in t he region of base pairs 275–280. These 
data suggest that ethylene oxide mutagenesis may in volve similar mechanisms in mice 
and rats. 
In ethylene oxide-exposed Big Blue  mice, molecular analyses of mutations in the 
lacI  transgene of bone marrow showed a decrease in muta tions at G:C base pairs and an 
increase at A:T base pairs, which were exclusively A:T →T:A transversions and 
accounted for 25.4% (14/55) of the mutations isolat ed (Recio et al. , 2004). In contrast,  ETHYLENE OXIDE 275  
 
 A:T →T:A transversions occurred at a frequency of 1.4% ( 1/70) in concurrent control 
mice. The mutational spectrum in the testes of ethyl ene oxide-exposed mice indicated that 
small increases across most mutational types were s ufficient to produce an overall in-
crease in the LacI mutation frequency, although this was not significan t for a specific type 
compared with controls.  
4.2.3 Mechanism of mutation induction 
Although abundant data in vitro  and in vivo  indicate that genotoxicity plays a major 
role in the carcinogenicity of ethylene oxide, and its mutagenicity is deemed to be a con-
sequence of high reactivity with DNA, the lesions r esponsible for ethylene oxide-induced 
mutations in vivo  have not yet been identified. Possible precursor les ions for the induction 
of mutations by ethylene oxide are thought to inclu de the formation of ( a) 7-HEG and 
other N-alkylated bases that may ‘predispose’ to mutationa l events, ( b) O6-HEG as a 
promutagenic adduct, ( c) hydroxyethyl adducts of the DNA backbone and ( d) secondary 
reactive oxygen species. Systematic studies of oxid ative damage from exposure to ethyl-
ene oxide in vivo  have not been performed and this potential source of mutation is not 
considered in depth here. Since the publication of the first data on mutational spectra 
following exposure of human cells in vitro  (Bastlová et al. , 1993) and exposure of mice to 
ethylene oxide in vivo  (Walker & Skopek, 1993), several lines of research  have been 
pursued in a limited fashion ( a) to assess the hypothesis that adducts that lead t o abasic 
(apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites may contribute to the  mutagenesis of ethylene oxide; ( b) to 
identify and characterize promutagenic adducts that  may account for certain types of 
mutations induced by ethylene oxide; and ( c) to evaluate the means by which adducts 
could cause large deletions and chromosomal alterat ions produced by ethylene oxide.  
As the major DNA adduct of ethylene oxide, 7-HEG is  unlikely to be directly 
promutagenic because N7-alkylguanine adducts formed from small epoxides s uch as 
ethylene oxide and propylene oxide do not cause distortion o f the double helix and do not 
interfere with hydrogen bonding (Albertini & Sweene y, 2007); rather, N7-alkylguanine 
adducts are hypothesized to result in mutation by l oss of the adduct via depurination or 
the action of DNA glycosylases. The resulting abasi c sites are non-coding and may result 
in base substitutions and strand breaks. The action  of apurinic endonuclease creates a 
single-strand break which, if unresolved, can lead to DNA double-strand breaks and, 
possibly, chromosomal alterations (Vogel & Nataraja n, 1982). Current data suggest that 
depurination of N7-alkylguanine adducts results largely in G →T transversions and, to a 
lesser extent, G →A transitions and G →C transversions (Loeb & Preston, 1986; Takeshita 
et al., 1987). Approximately half of the base substitutio ns at the Hprt  locus of splenic 
T cells of mice and rats exposed to ethylene oxide were at A:T base pairs (Walker & 
Skopek, 1993; Walker et al. , 1997b), and it is feasible that these mutations c ould originate 
from spontaneous or glycosylase-mediated depurinati on of 3-HEA and other N-hydroxy-
ethyl adducts of adenine/thymine, with subsequent b y-pass replication of abasic sites. 
While chemically induced abasic sites have been fou nd to be important in the mutagenic 276 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 mechanisms for only a few exogenous chemicals (Loeb  & Preston, 1986), the fact that 
> 98% of the DNA adducts produced by ethylene oxide  lead to abasic sites denoted the 
need to investigate their role in the mutagenesis o f this agent (Walker & Skopek, 1993). 
In order for these mutagenic events to occur at a rate  sufficient to result in ethylene oxide-
induced changes in mutational spectra (including in creases in base substitutions and 
deletions), accumulation of abasic sites that arise  from high levels of 7-HEG would be 
expected to occur over time (Rusyn et al. , 2005). 
A study was recently completed to test the hypothesis that ex posure to ethylene oxide 
results in the accumulation of abasic sites and ind uces changes in the expression of genes 
for base-excision DNA repair, which predisposes to point mutations and chromosomal 
aberrations in Fischer 344 rats exposed by inhalati on for 6 h per day on 5 days per week 
for 4 weeks to 0 or 100 ppm [183 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide or 0 to 3000 ppm ethylene 
(~ 6 ppm ethylene oxide) (Rusyn et al. , 2005). The resulting data demonstrated that, whil e 
7-HEG accumulates with repeated exposures, N-hydroxyethylation of DNA by ethylene 
oxide is repaired without accumulation of abasic si tes, and that the mechanisms proposed 
above probably play a minor role in the mutagenicity of thi s agent. The same conclusions 
would apply to the minor accumulation of 3-HEA and other N-hydroxyethyl adducts of 
adenine/thymine, and the induction of strand-breaks  or point mutations at A:T base pairs 
by ethylene oxide. 
Several investigators have proposed that the mutage nicity of ethylene oxide may in-
volve the action of minor promutagenic adducts, suc h as O6-HEG, N3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-
2′-deoxyuridine (3-HEdU) and possibly ring-opened 7-H EG (Solomon, 1999; van Sittert 
et al. , 2000; Rusyn et al. , 2005; Marsden et al. , 2007). O6-HEG is considered to be a 
miscoding lesion due to mispairing with thymine dur ing DNA replication (Ellison et al. , 
1989); however, this adduct is formed at extremely low levels in vivo  in ethylene oxide-
exposed rats (and presumably other species) and is efficiently removed from DNA by the 
repair protein O6-alkylguanine −DNA alkyltransferase and excision repair (Ludeke & 
Kleihues, 1988). In addition, only a few G →A mutations were found in p53  exons 6 and 
7 of ethylene oxide-induced mammary gland carcinoma s (Houle et al. , 2006) and these 
transitions were not significantly increased in rep orter genes of ethylene oxide-exposed 
mice and rats. While O6-HEG may contribute minimally to the mutagenicity o f ethylene 
oxide  in vivo , O6-alkylguanine adducts are probably important promut agenic lesions for 
epoxides with an S N1 character, such as styrene oxide (Latif et al. , 1988; Solomon, 1999). 
N3-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-2 ′-cytidine in DNA rapidly deaminates to stable, pote ntially muta-
genic 3-HEdU lesions (Solomon, 1999). This lesion h as been shown to block DNA 
replication by bacterial polymerases in vitro  and to cause G:C →A:T and G:C →T:A base 
substitutions (Bhanot et al. , 1994; Zhang et al. , 1995). In contrast, the formation of 
cytosine or uracil adducts has not been shown in ro dents exposed to ethylene oxide, and, 
if formed, 3-HEdU would be expected to be at very l ow levels and to contribute to a 
minor extent to the mutagenicity of ethylene oxide  in vivo . 7-HEG can undergo imidazole 
ring-opening to chemically stable, potentially muta genic lesions (Solomon, 1999). 
Formation of ethylene oxide-induced ring-opened 7-H EG has not been demonstrated in  ETHYLENE OXIDE 277  
 
 vivo  but is worthy of investigation in the future. Expl oration of other potential pro-
mutagenic adducts of ethylene oxide should not only  include site-directed mutagenesis 
studies to characterize the mutagenic specificity a nd efficiency of these adducts, but also 
experiments in vivo  to demonstrate whether or not these adducts occur at biologically 
relevant concentrations in ethylene oxide-exposed r odents. 
Because exposure to ethylene oxide is associated wi th cytogenetic effects in humans 
and induces deletions in human cells in vitro and in rodents in vivo , it is also essential to 
determine which DNA adducts and mechanism(s) are re sponsible for large-scale 
mutational events. The suspected metabolite of ethy lene oxide, glycolaldehyde, has been 
shown to form DNA–protein crosslinks and single-strand br eaks in vitro  (Hengstler et al. , 
1994), but no information is available on the forma tion of this intermediate in vivo  or its 
potential effects following exposures to ethylene o xide. The lack of accumulation of 
abasic sites during repeated high-dose exposures of  rats to ethylene oxide (Rusyn et al. , 
2005) does not favour a mechanism that involves the induction of strand breaks via abasic 
sites that result from labile DNA adducts (Lindahl, 1979).  Another postulated mechanism 
for ethylene oxide-induced strand scissions is via the formation of a β-hydroxyethyl 
phosphotriester adduct that requires the interactio n of the β-hydroxyethyl group with the 
phosphate backbone (Agurell et al. , 1991). 2-Hydroxyethylation of phosphate groups 
introduces extreme instability into the sugar–phosp hate backbone, since the resultant 
phosphotriester breaks down through a dioxaphosphol ane ring intermediate (Eisenbrand 
et al. , 1986). This alternative mechanism for ethylene ox ide-induced strand breaks and 
chromosomal damage deserves further investigation b oth in vitro and in vivo . 
4.2.4 Alterations in oncogenes and suppressor genes in tumours 
The ability of ethylene oxide to induce alterations in ras  proto-oncogenes and the p53  
tumour-suppressor gene has been investigated in imm unohistochemical and molecular 
studies of mutations in control and chemically induced neop lasms of B6C3F 1 mice. In the 
first investigation of spontaneous and ethylene oxi de-induced mammary gland carci-
nomas, the p53  and H-ras  genes were selected for study because they are among the mo st 
commonly altered genes in human cancers, mutations in both often occur in the same 
cancer cell and several lines of evidence support a n interaction between these genes 
during the multistep process of oncogenesis (Houle et al. , 2006). Immunohistochemistry 
results showed that p53 protein expression was dete cted in 42% (8/19) of spontaneous 
and 67% (8/12) of ethylene oxide-induced carcinomas . Further semiquantitative 
evaluations revealed that the protein levels were s ixfold higher in cancers from exposed 
mice than in those from control mice (i.e. the aver age scores by the ‘quickscore method’ 
were 3.83 and 0.63, respectively). Mutations in p53  exons 5−8 were detected in eight of 
12 (67%) ethylene oxide-induced carcinomas; five of  the eight mutations had two or more 
base changes. Fourteen base substitutions were iden tified, including eight silent muta-
tions, five missense mutations and one nonsense mut ation; no, four, seven and three 
mutations occurred in exons 5, 6, 7 and 8, respecti vely. Nine of 14 alterations (64%) 278 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 involved guanine bases, including mutations in codons 24 1 and 264 that occurred in more 
than one neoplasm from mice treated with 50 and 100  ppm [91.5 and 183 mg 3] ethylene 
oxide. Ethylene oxide-induced mammary carcinomas ex hibited a clear dose-related 
response in relation to the level of p53 protein ex pression and the number of p53  gene 
mutations. Base substitutions were found in the p53  gene in 58% (7/12) of spontaneous 
mammary carcinomas, including five silent mutations , seven missense mutations and one 
nonsense mutation. However, in contrast to the resu lts seen in the tumours of ethylene 
oxide-exposed animals, nine of the 13 mutations occ urred in exon 5, none was found in 
exon 6 and seven were C →T transitions. H- ras  Mutations in codon 61 (bases CAA) were 
detected in 33% (4/12) and 26% (5/19) of ethylene o xide-induced and spontaneous 
mammary carcinomas, respectively. All ethylene oxid e-induced alterations were missense 
mutations localized to the second base (or mutation s at adenine), whereas 80% (4/5) of 
spontaneous mutations occurred in the first base of  codon 61 (or mutations at cytosine) 
with the remaining mutation found in the third base  of codon 61 (Houle et al ., 2006). 
Analyses for cancer gene mutations were extended to  other target tissues by 
evaluating the occurrence K- ras  gene mutations in lung, Harderian gland and uterin e 
neoplasms from ethylene oxide-exposed and control B 6C3F 1 mice (Hong et al. , 2007). 
Specifically, the base triplets for codons 12 (GGT) , 13 (GGC) and 61 (CAA) were 
examined for mutations. K- ras  Gene mutations were identified in 100% (23/23) of the 
ethylene oxide-induced lung neoplasms and 25% (27/1 08) of the spontaneous lung neo-
plasms. Codon 12 mutations were most common in the lung neoplasms from both 
exposed and control mice; however, 97% (21/23) of t he ethylene oxide-induced tumours 
had a G →T transversion at the second base compared with onl y one in 108 spontaneous 
tumours that exhibited this mutation, while 11 spon taneous tumours had a G →A tran-
sition in the second base compared with only two et hylene oxide-induced tumours. In 
Harderian gland neoplasms, 86% (18/21) of ethylene oxide-induced tumours compared 
with 7% (2/27) of spontaneous tumours contained K- ras gene mutations. Codon 13 G →C 
and codon 12 G →T transversions were the predominant mutations in e thylene oxide-
induced Harderian gland neoplasms, but these did no t occur in the spontaneous counter-
parts. Spontaneous uterine carcinomas were not exam ined, but 83% (5/6) of such neo-
plasms from ethylene oxide-exposed mice had K- ras  gene mutations, all of which were 
codon 13 C →T transitions. Dose-related trends for K- ras  gene mutations were found for 
all three cancer types in mice treated with 50 and 100 ppm [91.5 and 183 mg/m 3] in the 
cancer bioassay of ethylene oxide. 
These data  on p53  and ras  gene mutational spectra show distinct differences in the 
locations and types of base substitutions in sponta neous versus ethylene oxide-induced 
neoplasms in mice. Futhermore, the profile of K- ras  gene mutations in ethylene oxide-
induced lung and Harderian gland neoplasms was diff erent from that described for other 
chemically induced tumours of the same tissues, whi ch suggests that ethylene oxide 
induces a chemical-specific signature for base subs titutions (Hong et al. , 2007). Based 
upon the spectra of p53  and H-ras  gene mutations in mammary gland neoplasms, Houle 
et al.  (2006) suggested that purine bases (guanine and ad enine) serve as the primary  ETHYLENE OXIDE 279  
 
 targets for mutation by ethylene oxide while mutati on that involves mostly cytosine 
appears to be a more common spontaneous event. The larger data set for cancer gene 
mutations in spontaneous and ethylene oxide-induced  neoplasms of the lung, Harderian 
gland, uterus and mammary gland indicates that ethy lene oxide probably increases the 
mutant fraction for most types of base substitution  across proto-oncogenes and tumour-
suppressor genes, as was found in the Hprt  gene of T cells and the LacI gene of testes 
from ethylene oxide-exposed mice. The overall data suggest that a common mechanism 
for ethylene oxide is as a point mutagen in oncogen es and tumour-suppressor genes of 
multiple tissues in mice. 
4.3 Mechanisms of carcinogenesis 
Ethylene oxide is a direct-acting alkylating agent that has been shown to have 
genotoxic and mutagenic activity in numerous assays  in both somatic and germ cells, and 
in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (IARC,  1994). It is active in a wide range of 
in-vitro and in-vivo systems. Increases in both gen e mutations and chromosomal alter-
ations, two general classes of cancer-related genet ic changes, have been observed. In-vitro 
and in-vivo studies have shown that ethylene oxide can bind to cellular macromolecules, 
which results in a variety of DNA, RNA and protein adducts. The major DNA adduct 
recovered in vivo  is 7-HEG and additional adducts such as 3-HEA and O6-HEG are 
detected at much lower levels (Walker et al ., 1992b). In-vitro studies indicate that other 
minor adducts can also be formed from the reaction of ethylene oxide with the N1 and N6 
of adenine and the N3 of cytosine, uracil and thymine (IARC, 1994; Tate s et al ., 1999; 
Kolman et al ., 2002). While the exact mechanism by which these adducts lead to 
mutation is unknown, a number of mechanisms could b e involved, including the mis-
pairing of altered bases or the formation of apurin ic/apyrimidinic sites via DNA repair or 
chemical depurination/depyrimidination combined wit h the insertion of another base, 
which would typically be an adenine opposite an apu rinic site (Tates et al ., 1999; Houle et 
al ., 2006). These lesions can also lead to the format ion of single-strand breaks and, 
subsequently, to chromosomal breakage. In addition,  the putative ethylene oxide metabo-
lite, glycolaldehyde, has been shown to form DNA–pr otein cross-links and DNA single-
strand breaks (Hengstler et al ., 1994).  
In-vivo studies using reporter genes such as Hprt  or the LacI  transgene have shown 
that ethylene oxide can significantly increase the frequency of mutations following expo-
sure in both mice and rats (Walker et al ., 1993; Sisk et al ., 1997; Walker et al ., 1997a,b; 
Tates et al ., 1999; Recio et al ., 2004). The type of mutation that is recovered app ears to be 
influenced by the assay system involved. In mouse s plenic and/or thymic T lymphocytes, 
mutations in Hprt  could be detected after shorter exposures (4-week inhalation exposure 
or multiple intraperitoneal injections over 1 week)  and appeared to consist of larger 
deletion mutations as well as base-pair substitutio ns and frameshift mutations (Walker et 
al ., 1993, 1997a,b). The latter point mutations appea red to originate primarily from either 
altered G or altered A bases (Walker et al ., 1993; IARC, 1994). In the inhalation study, 280 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 significant increases in LacI  mutations were not seen in the spleen, bone marrow  or germ 
cells of mice after 4 weeks of exposure to ethylene oxide (Sisk et al ., 1997). A modest but 
significant increase in LacI  mutants was seen in the lungs of mice exposed to 2 00 ppm 
[366 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide. In a follow-up study with prolong ed exposure (up to 
48 weeks), significant increases in LacI  mutants were seen in the bone marrow and testes 
of ethylene oxide-exposed transgenic mice (Recio et al ., 2004). DNA sequence analysis 
of mutants obtained from the bone marrow showed that only AT →TA transversions were 
recovered at a significantly increased frequency in  the exposed mice. A unique mutational 
spectrum was not seen in the testes.  
Only limited information is available on the mutage nicity of ethylene oxide in 
humans. A significant increase in HPRT  mutation frequency was reported in one group of 
workers with prolonged higher exposures to ethylene  oxide (~5 ppm [ ∼ 9.15 mg/m 3] 
TWA) but not in another group with lower exposure l evels (0.025 ppm [0.046 mg/m 3] 
TWA) (Tates et al ., 1991; Kolman et al ., 2002).  
In two recent studies, an elevated frequency of mut ations or a change in mutational 
spectra has been seen in the tumours of ethylene ox ide-treated mice (Houle et al ., 2006; 
Hong et al ., 2007). In the Hong et al . (2007) study, K- ras  mutations were detected in 
100% (23/23) of ethylene oxide-induced lung tumours  compared with 25% (27/108) of 
spontaneous tumours. Codon 12 G →T transversions occurred frequently in the ethylene  
oxide-induced lung neoplasms (21/23) but infrequent ly in spontaneous lung neoplasms 
(1/108). Similarly, K- ras  mutations were present in 86% (18/21) of Harderian  gland 
tumours from ethylene oxide-treated animals but wer e only seen in 7% (2/27) of the 
spontaneous tumours in this organ. Codon 13 G →C and codon 12 G →T transversions 
were common in the ethylene oxide-induced but absen t in the spontaneous Harderian 
gland tumours (0/27). K- ras  Mutations were also seen in 83% (5/6) of ethylene oxide-
induced uterine tumours, all of which exhibited a G →C transition in codon 13. The 
incidence in spontaneous uterine tumours was not re ported. A similar study by Houle et 
al . (2006) provided evidence of the involvement of H- ras  and p53  mutations in mammary 
gland tumours induced by ethylene oxide in mice. Th e mutation frequency was only 
slightly elevated for H- ras  (33% in treated versus 26% in spontaneous) or p53  (67% in 
the ethylene oxide-treated versus 58% in the contro l animals), but the mutational spectra 
of tumours obtained from control and treated animal s differed significantly. The muta-
tional spectra were generally consistent with a tar geting of G and A bases by ethylene 
oxide (Houle et al ., 2006; Hong et al ., 2007). The high frequencies of mutation present in 
these genes, particularly mutations in the critical cod ons of K-ras  and inactivation of p53 , 
indicate that mutations are induced in the tumours of ethyl ene oxide-treated mice and that 
the changes probably play an important role in ethy lene oxide-induced tumorigenesis in 
these tissues.  
Little is known about the mechanisms that might lea d to ethylene oxide-induced 
tumours in humans. However, activating mutations in  the ras  family of oncogenes and 
inactivation of p53  have been shown to play critical roles in the deve lopment of both 
spontaneous and chemically induced cancers (Pederse n-Bjergaard et al ., 2006; Zarbl,  ETHYLENE OXIDE 281  
 
 2006). For example, activating mutations in ras  genes have been shown to occur in up to 
30% of cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia (Byrne & Marshall, 1998). In most cases, 
N-ras is activated, although activation of K-ras is  occasionally seen (Byrne & Marshall, 
1998; Bowen et al ., 2005; Christiansen et al ., 2005). The mutations typically occur in 
codons 12, 13 and 61, sites that are critical for t he normal regulation of ras activity. The 
activating mutations lead to the generation of cons titutively activated ras proteins that 
cannot be switched off and inappropriately generate  proliferative signals within the cell 
(Byrne & Marshall, 1998). Some patients who lack ras  mutations still exhibit an 
overexpression of ras  genes and this has been considered as further evid ence for the 
involvement of dysregulated ras signalling in leuka emogenesis (Byrne & Marshall, 1998).  
Acute myelogenous leukaemia in patients who have pr eviously been treated with 
alkylating agents frequently exhibits distinctive c haracteristics that allow it to be distin-
guished from acute myelogenous leukaemia induced by  other agents (such as topo-
isomerase II inhibitors) or that occurs spontaneous ly (Pedersen-Bjergaard & Rowley, 
1994; Pedersen-Bjergaard et al ., 2006). One of the hallmarks of leukaemias induce d by 
alkylating agents is that they frequently exhibit l oss of chromosomes 5 or 7 (-5, -7) or loss 
of part of the long arms of these chromosomes (5q-,  7q-). In addition, mutations in p53  
are frequently seen in leukaemias with the -5/5q- karyot ype, and mutations in p53  and ras  
are seen in a subset of those that exhibit the -7/7 q- karyotype (Christiansen et al ., 2001; 
Pedersen-Bjergaard et al ., 2006). Although ethylene oxide has not been inve stigated 
specifically for its ability to induce losses in ch romosomes 7 and 5 or deletions of the long 
arms of chromosomes 7 and 5 (7q- or 5q-), it has be en reported to induce similar types of 
chromosomal alterations and deletions in a variety of experimental models and/or in the 
lymphocytes of exposed workers (IARC, 1994; Major et al ., 1996, 1999). The detection 
of elevated levels of chromosomal aberrations and m icronuclei in the peripheral blood 
lymphocytes of ethylene oxide-exposed workers is of  particular note, as multiple pro-
spective studies have reported that individuals wit h increased levels of chromosomal 
aberrations or micronuclei in these cells are at in creased risk for developing cancer 
(Hagmar et al ., 1998; Liou et al ., 1999; Smerhovsky et al ., 2001; Hagmar  et al. , 2004; 
Boffetta et al ., 2007; Bonassi et al ., 2007).  
A comparison of the evidence for ethylene oxide-induced gen etic and related changes 
in experimental animals and humans is summarized in  Table 12.  282 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
Ethylene oxide is a flammable gas. It was first pro duced in the 1910s by the chloro-
hydrin process, which has gradually been replaced b y the direct oxidation of ethylene 
since the 1930s. Ethylene oxide is used predominant ly for the production of other 
chemicals, such as ethylene glycols, ethoxylates, ethano l amines and glycol ethers, and its 
use is increasing. It is also used as a sterilant t o treat hospital equipment, disposable 
medical items, spices and other products. The highe st human exposures occur in occupa-
tional settings. Historically, 8-h time-weighted av erage exposures above 20 mg/m 3 were 
common when the chlorohydrin process was used, whil e average exposures of 2–
20 mg/m 3 were reported during direct oxidation of ethylene and in plants that produce 
sterilized medical items. The largest group of expo sed workers is hospital personnel who 
perform sterilization operations. The average level s of exposure in hospitals and pro-
duction facilities have decreased significantly (on  average to below 1 ppm [2 mg/m 3]) in 
western Europe and North America following the intr oduction of new occupational 
exposure limits in the mid-1980s. High peak exposure s may still occur in some short-term 
work tasks. Ethylene oxide may occur in indoor air at levels generally < 0.2 mg/m 3,  ETHYLENE OXIDE 283  
 
 probably due to small amounts in tobacco smoke. Eth ylene oxide residues have also been 
detected in some spices and other food products. 
5.2 Cancer in humans  
Epidemiological evidence of the risk for human canc er from ethylene oxide derives 
principally from the follow-up of 14 cohorts of exposed wo rkers either in chemical plants 
where ethylene oxide was produced or converted into  derivatives or in facilities where it 
was used as a sterilant. Data from 10 of the cohort s were collated in a meta-analysis that 
was published in 1999, but this did not include upd ates of two cohorts that were published 
after that time. Many of the cohort members employe d at chemical factories were also 
exposed to other chemicals. 
By far the most informative epidemiological investi gation was a study by the 
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Healt h of more than 18 000 employees at 
14 industrial facilities in the USA where ethylene oxide was used to sterilize medical 
supplies or food spices, or to test the sterilizing  equipment. This investigation benefited 
not only from greater statistical power than other studies (as a consequence of its large 
size), but also from a lower potential for confound ing by concomitant exposure to other 
chemicals and from incorporation of detailed quanti tative assessments of individual 
exposures to ethylene oxide. For these reasons, the  Working Group gave greatest weight 
to the National Institute for Occupational Safety a nd Health study when assessing the 
balance of epidemiological evidence on ethylene oxi de, although findings from other 
studies were also taken into account. 
In examining the epidemiological evidence, the Work ing Group focused in particular 
on lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers and on canc ers of the breast, stomach, pancreas 
and brain. These sites were selected because excess  risks had been suggested by one or 
more epidemiological study or because tumours at th e same site had been reported in 
rodent bioassays. 
Evaluation of the possible risks for lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer was 
hampered by temporal changes and inconsistencies in  the histopathological classification 
of diagnoses. The interpretation of results for the se malignancies was constrained by the 
diagnostic groupings that had been used by research ers when the studies were conducted 
and possible errors in the exact specification of t umours on death certificates. 
The Working Group found some epidemiological eviden ce for associations between 
ethylene oxide and lymphatic and haematopoietic can cers, and specifically lymphoid 
tumours (i.e. non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myelom a and chronic lymphocytic leu-
kaemia). In the most recent follow-up of the Nation al Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health cohort, no overall excess of deaths from  non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple 
myeloma was observed in comparison with national de ath rates. However, in an internal 
analysis, mortality from lymphoid tumours (as defin ed above) was associated with 
measures of cumulative exposure to ethylene oxide a mong men. No corresponding asso-
ciation was found among women. Other studies did no t point consistently to an increase 284 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 in the risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myel oma in comparisons with external 
reference populations, although moderate elevations  of risk were reported in some 
investigations.  
Early reports of an excess risk for all types of le ukaemia combined have not been 
confirmed by later studies. In the latest analysis of the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health cohort, mortality from all types of leukaemia combined was close to 
that expected from national rates. Weak evidence fo r an exposure–response relationship 
between cumulative exposure to ethylene oxide and l eukaemia was observed in a pre-
vious analysis of this cohort. Results from other c ohort studies did not point clearly or 
consistently to an increased risk for leukaemia. 
The numbers of cases of Hodgkin lymphoma in publish ed studies were too few to 
draw meaningful conclusions. 
Four of the cohort studies provided useful informat ion on the association between 
exposure to ethylene oxide and breast cancer. The N ational Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health study and a cohort study of hospi tal sterilization workers in the United 
Kingdom examined mortality from breast cancer and f ound no overall excess risk. Three 
studies examined the incidence of breast cancer: th e National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health study and a cohort study from Swe den found no overall excess risk for 
breast cancer, while another cohort study from New York State, USA, found a borderline 
significant excess risk of about 60%. Cancer incide nce was recognized to be under-
estimated in the National Institute for Occupationa l Safety and Health study, which was 
thus negatively biased for the investigation of ove rall cancer incidence. 
A study conducted within the National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health 
cohort was designed to investigate the association between exposure to ethylene oxide 
and the risk for breast cancer in greater detail. I nternal analyses in this study found 
increased relative risks for breast cancer in the h igher categories of cumulative exposure 
to ethylene oxide and a significant exposure–respon se relationship, both of which per-
sisted in analyses that controlled for parity and h istory of breast cancer in a first-degree 
relative. The risk for the highest category of cumu lative exposure was almost doubled. 
While early epidemiological studies had suggested i ncreased risks for stomach and 
pancreatic cancer in workers exposed to ethylene ox ide, these findings were not supported 
by more recent, larger studies (including the Natio nal Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health investigation); nor did the balance of e pidemiological evidence point to an 
increased risk for brain cancer in humans exposed t o ethylene oxide. 
5.3 Cancer in experimental animals  
Ethylene oxide was tested for carcinogenicity in on e experiment by intragastric intu-
bation in female rats, by inhalation in female mice in one ex periment and in both sexes of 
mice in another experiment, by inhalation in both s exes of rats in one experiment and in 
male rats of the same strain in another experiment.  It was also tested in single studies in 
female mice by skin application and by subcutaneous  injection.   ETHYLENE OXIDE 285  
 
 In the experiment of intragastric intubation in fem ale rats, ethylene oxide produced 
tumours of the forestomach, which were mainly squam ous-cell carcinomas. In one study 
in both sexes of mice, inhalation of ethylene oxide  resulted in increases in the incidence of 
alveolar/bronchiolar lung tumours and tumours of th e Harderian gland in animals of each 
sex and of uterine adenocarcinomas, mammary carcino mas and malignant lymphomas in 
females. In a pulmonary tumour bioassay in female st rain A/J mice, inhalation of ethylene 
oxide increased the number of pulmonary adenomas pe r mouse. In both experiments in 
which male and female rats of one strain were expos ed by inhalation, ethylene oxide 
increased the incidence of mononuclear-cell leukaem ia and brain tumours in animals of 
each sex and of peritoneal mesotheliomas in the reg ion of the testis and subcutaneous 
fibromas in males. Ethylene oxide produced local sa rcomas in female mice following 
subcutaneous injection. In a limited study in femal e mice treated by skin application, no 
skin tumours were observed. 
5.4 Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Inhaled ethylene oxide is readily taken up by the l ungs, is absorbed efficiently into the 
blood and is systemically distributed in rodents an d in humans. Ethylene oxide is con-
verted by both enzymatic and non-enzymatic hydrolys is to ethylene glycol, which is 
excreted or further metabolized, and by conjugation  with glutathione mediated by the 
polymorphic glutathione- S-transferase T1. Glycolaldehyde, which is potential ly formed 
by further metabolism of ethylene glycol, can cause  DNA–protein crosslinks and DNA 
strand breaks. A striking difference in the metabol ism of ethylene oxide between rodents 
and humans is the predominance of the glutathione conjugati on pathway in mice and rats, 
while the pathway initiated by enzymatic and non-en zymatic hydrolysis is of greater 
importance in humans. Simulations indicated that, i n mice, rats and humans, about 80%, 
60% and 20%, respectively, would be metabolized via  glutathione conjugation. Despite 
these differences, physiologically based pharmacoki netic models of uptake and metabo-
lism of ethylene oxide in the range of exposures us ed in rodent bioassays (100 ppm 
[180 mg/m 3] and below) yielded simulated blood peak concentrations a nd areas under the 
curve that were similar for mice, rats and humans.  
Ethylene oxide is a direct-acting alkylating agent that forms adducts with proteins and 
DNA. Haemoglobin adducts have been used for biomoni toring purposes, in view of the 
significant correlation between cumulative exposure  over 4 months (the lifespan of 
human erythrocytes) and levels of adducts in the ha emoglobin of ethylene oxide-exposed 
workers. Endogenous hydroxyethyl adducts of haemogl obin and DNA are also found in 
both humans and experimental animals in the absence  of known exogenous exposure to 
ethylene oxide. N7-Hydroxyethylguanine is quantitatively the major DN A adduct formed, 
but does not appear to be directly promutagenic. Mi nor promutagenic adducts proposed 
for ethylene oxide are either induced at very low l evels or have not been shown to occur 
in humans or experimental animals. 286 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 
 Studies of workers exposed to ethylene oxide in hos pital and factory sterilization units 
and in ethylene oxide manufacturing and processing plants have been fairly consistent in 
showing chromosomal damage in peripheral blood lymp hocytes, which included sister 
chromatid exchange in 21 of 33 study groups, chromo somal aberrations in 18 of 24 study 
groups and micronucleus formation in four of 18 study  groups. In ethylene oxide-exposed 
workers, the frequency of micronucleus formation wa s also elevated in the bone marrow 
in one study and in nasal mucosal cells in another study, but not in exfoliated buccal cells 
in two studies. In general, the degree of chromosom al damage was correlated with level 
and duration of exposure, and the majority of posit ive results were found in studies that 
evaluated individuals who were exposed to time-weig hted average concentrations greater 
than 5 ppm [9 mg/m 3] ethylene oxide. Elevated levels of chromosomal ab errations and 
micronucleus formation in peripheral blood lymphocy tes have been associated with 
increased risks for cancer in humans. One study suggested a n elevation in gene mutations 
in one of two groups of ethylene oxide-exposed work ers. Several other biomarkers of 
DNA damage, which include unscheduled DNA synthesis , DNA single-strand breaks, 
premature centromere divisions and DNA–protein crossl inks, have been studied by only a 
few investigators. 
Collectively, the genotoxicity data in experimental  systems consistently demonstrate 
that ethylene oxide is a mutagen and clastogen acro ss all phylogenetic levels tested. 
Ethylene oxide induced unscheduled DNA synthesis, D NA strand breaks, gene mutation, 
sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberratio ns in cultured human cells, as well 
as mutations, chromosomal aberrations, micronucleus  formation and cell transformation 
in rodent cells in vitro . It also induced gene mutation, specific locus mutatio n, sister chro-
matid exchange, chromosomal aberrations, micronucle us formation, dominant lethal 
mutation and heritable translocation in somatic and /or germ cells in rodents treated in 
vivo . Analogous genetic and related effects of ethylene  oxide were observed in non-
mammalian systems. Unequivocal data show that ethyl ene oxide caused dose-related 
increases in point mutations in both reporter genes  and cancer genes of multiple tissues 
from mice and rats exposed to 25–200 ppm [45–360 mg /m 3] ethylene oxide, doses that 
encompassed all but the lowest concentration used in roden t cancer bioassays. In these in-
vivo studies, ethylene oxide was consistently a rel atively weak point mutagen. Ethylene 
oxide induced sister chromatid exchange but not chr omosomal aberrations or micro-
nucleus formation in rodents exposed by inhalation to concentrations that were used in 
carcinogenicity studies. In contrast, assays for th e potential clastogenic effects of inha-
lation of this concentration range of ethylene oxid e by rodents have not been performed 
uniformly in an optimal fashion. Rodent studies tha t were positive for clastogenicity 
following exposure to higher doses of ethylene oxid e or via a less relevant route of ex-
posure may also be informative for a risk for chrom osomal events under some exposure 
scenarios in ethylene oxide-exposed humans. With re gard to the mode of action of 
ethylene oxide as a genotoxic carcinogen in rodents , there is clear evidence that point 
mutations in ras  proto-oncogenes and the p53  tumour-suppressor gene (which are 
involved in a range of human cancers) are key event s in the development of cancers, but  ETHYLENE OXIDE 287  
 
 the role of chromosomal alterations as primary mutat ional events in the carcinogenicity of 
ethylene oxide in mice and rats is still uncertain.   
6. Evaluation and Rationale 
6.1 Carcinogenicity in humans 
There is limited evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of ethylene oxid e. 
6.2 Carcinogenicity in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of  
ethylene oxide. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
Ethylene oxide is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).  
6.4 Rationale 
In making the overall evaluation, the Working Group  also took into consideration the 
following supporting evidence: 
(a) Ethylene oxide is a direct-acting alkylating agen t that reacts with DNA. 
(b) Ethylene oxide induces a dose-related increase in  the frequency of ethylene 
oxide-derived haemoglobin adducts in exposed humans  and rodents. 
(c) Ethylene oxide induces a dose-related increase in  the frequency of ethylene 
oxide-derived DNA adducts in exposed rodents. 
(d) Ethylene oxide consistently acts as a mutagen and  clastogen at all phylogenetic 
levels. 
(e) Ethylene oxide induces heritable translocations i n the germ cells of exposed 
rodents. 
(f) Ethylene oxide induces a dose-related increase in  the frequency of sister 
chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations and mic ronucleus formation in 
the lymphocytes of exposed workers. 
(g) Prospective studies have shown that elevated leve ls of chromosomal aberrations 
and micronucleus formation in peripheral blood lymp hocytes are associated with 
increased risks for cancer in humans. 288 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

(IARC, 1974), February 1978 (IARC, 1979) and March 1987 (IARC, 1987). Since that 
time new data have become available, and these have  been incorporated into the 
monograph and taken into account in the present eva luation.

1.1.5  Analysis  
Several reviews of methods of sampling and analysis  of vinyl chloride in the work-
place atmosphere, ambient air, water, water piping,  food and cigarette smoke, and of 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are available (Environment al Protection Agency, 1975; 
Laramy, 1977; Egan et al ., 1978). 
Several methods for the analysis of vinyl chloride in ambient air have been devel-
oped. The Environmental Protection Agency method TO- 1 analyses volatile organic com-
pounds in ambient air using Tenax ® and detection by gas chromatography (GS)–mass 
spectrometry (MS); method TO-14 analyses volatile o rganic compounds in ambient air 
using canister sampling followed by high-resolution  GC (Environmental Protection 
Agency, 1999).

pressure (101.3 kPa)  VINYL CHLORIDE 313  
 
 A GC analytical method has been used since 1978 to determine vinyl chloride con-
centrations in foodstuffs and in vinyl chloride pol ymers and copolymers that are intended 
to come into contact with food (Directive 78-142-EE C; European Commission, 1978). 
The Department of Labor (1989) of the USA published  the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration method 75 that detects vinyl chloride in air with a reliable quan-
titation limit of 0.020 ppm [0.051 mg/m 3]. More recently, Charvet et al . (2000) proposed 
the use of a solid-phase microextraction/GS/MS to an alyse vinyl chloride in materials and 
aqueous samples. 
1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
The most common method for the production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) is 
by thermal cracking of ethylene dichloride (1,2-dic hloroethane). Over 95% of the VCM 
produced worldwide in 2006 was made by this method.  A less common method is by 
hydrochlorination of acetylene (WHO, 1999; Cowfer &  Gorensek, 2006). 
In the ethylene-based process, ethylene dichloride is synthesized by the reaction of 
elemental chlorine with ethylene over a catalyst. The crude  ethylene dichloride is washed, 
dried and purified. Pure, dry ethylene dichloride i s thermally cracked to produce VCM 
and hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen chloride recovered from the cracking of ethylene di-
chloride is recycled in the process via reaction wi th oxygen and ethylene over a copper 
catalyst to make more ethylene dichloride. This pro cess is known as oxychlorination. 
VCM is purified by distillation, and side-products can be recovered for the manufacture 
of chlorinated solvents, or combusted or catalytica lly oxidized usually with recovery of 
hydrogen chloride (WHO, 1999; Cowfer & Gorensek, 20 06). 
VCM was initially produced commercially by the acet ylene-based process, in which 
acetylene (usually produced by the reaction of water w ith calcium carbide) is reacted with 
hydrogen chloride over a mercury-based catalyst. VC M is again purified by distillation 
(WHO, 1999; Cowfer & Gorensek, 2006). Acetylene-bas ed plants continue to operate 
solely in China. In 2001, the chemical corporation Borden stopped production at its 
acetylene plant in Louisiana, USA (Borruso, 2006). 
The ethylene dichloride/VCM/PVC production chain re presents the largest single 
consumer of chlorine (European Commission, 2003).  
Vinyl chloride has been produced commercially in th e USA for over 70 years (Tariff 
Commission, 1928). In 1988, the production of vinyl  chloride in the USA was 9.1 billion 
pounds [4.1 million tonnes] and increased to around  13.75 billion pounds [6.2 million 
tonnes] in 1993 (ACGIH  Worldwide, 2005). In Taiwan, China, production has in creased 
from 12 000 tonnes in 1971 (Luo et al. , 1999) to 1.7 million tonnes in 2005 (Borruso, 
2006). 
In 1999, worldwide production capacity was around 3 0 million tonnes (SIDS, 2001). 
Worldwide production capacity of VCM in 2005 was 35  million tonnes (Dow Chemical 314 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 Company, 2007). Table 1 gives production levels in various countries and regions 
(Borruso, 2006).

1.2.2 Use  
Vinyl chloride is used primarily (> 95%) in the man ufacture of PVCs, which 
comprise about 12% of plastic usage (WHO, 1999). Th e largest use of PVC resins is in 
the production of plastic piping. Other important u ses are in floor coverings, consumer 
goods, electrical applications and transport applic ations. About 1% of PVC capacity is 
used to produce vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copoly mer. Other minor uses of VCM 
include the manufacture of chlorinated solvents (pr imarily 10 000 tonnes per year of 
1,1,1-trichloroethane) and ethylene diamine product ion for the manufacture of resins 
(WHO, 1999; European Commission, 2003).  
Vinyl chloride has been used in the past as a refri gerant, as an extraction solvent for 
heat-sensitive materials, in the production of chlo roacetaldehyde, as an aerosol propellant 
and in drug and cosmetic products; these uses were banned in the USA by the Environ-
mental Protection Agency in 1974 (ATSDR, 2006).   VINYL CHLORIDE 315  
 
 1.3 Occurrence  
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
Vinyl chloride is not known to occur naturally.  
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
According to the 1990–93 CAREX database for 15 coun tries of the European Union 
(Kauppinen et al. , 2000) and the 1981–83 National Occupational Expos ure Survey in the 
USA (NOES, 1997), approximately 40 000 workers in E urope and 80 000 workers in the 
USA were potentially exposed to vinyl chloride (see  General Remarks). 
The major categories of industries that entail expo sure to VCM in Europe comprise 
the manufacture of industrial chemicals (10 400 per sons), plastic products (9100 persons) 
and other chemical products (7600) (Kauppinen et al ., 2000). In the USA, the major cate-
gories of industries were the production of chemica ls and allied products (15 400), 
business services (10 000) and the production of ru bber and miscellaneous plastic 
products (9600) (NOES, 1997). 
The Finnish Register of occupational exposure to ca rcinogens reported that 90 
workers were notified as being exposed to vinyl chloride in  2004. This is below 0.01% of 
the 2.4 million people employed in Finland. Most of  the exposed were employed in the 
chemical industry. The register is based on annual notifications of employers and its 
completeness is unknown (Saalo et al. , 2006).  
In Taiwan, China, where production has increased dr amatically in recent decades, 
thousands of workers could be exposed to VCM (Luo et al. , 1999). 
The main route of occupational exposure is by inhal ation, which occurs primarily in 
vinyl chloride/PVC plants and in PVC processing pla nts. Few measured exposure data 
have been reported but estimates from the chemical industry indicate that exposure to 
VCM amounted to several thousands of milligrams per  cubic metre in the 1940s and 
1950s, and were several hundreds of milligrams per cubic metre in the 1960s and early 
1970s. After its recognition as a carcinogen, occup ational exposure standards were set at 
approximately 13–26 mg/m 3 [5–10 ppm] in most countries in the 1970s (Fleig &  Thiess, 
1974; WHO, 1999). 
A report from the Centers for Disease Control and P revention (CDC) in the USA 
concluded that the development and acceptance by th e PVC industry of a closed-loop 
polymerization process in the late 1970s “almost co mpletely eliminated worker expo-
sures” and that “new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization 
workers have been virtually eliminated” (CDC, 1997; s ee also Section 1.4). Even after the 
late 1970s, however, high concentrations were repor ted and may still be encountered in 
some countries (see Table 2). 316 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 (a) Production of vinyl chloride and its derivatives 
Measured levels of VCM concentrations in vinyl chlo ride/PVC production are sum-
marized in Table 2 (WHO, 1999). Only one recent stu dy was found in which levels of 
exposure to vinyl chloride were reported (Zhu et al. , 2005a).  
Zhu et al . (2005a) reported the exposure to VCM of workers i n a plant in China. 
Ambient air levels of VCM at different worksites in  the plant ranged from 0.3 to 
17.8 ppm [0.8–48.4 mg/m 3]; the geometric average concentration was 2.6 ppm 
[7.1 mg/m 3]. In another study in Taiwan, China (Du et al ., 1996), the highest median 
concentration was reported for short-term exposure (15–40 min) of a tank cleaner was 
70 mg/m 3 [27 ppm].  
In former socialist countries in eastern Europe, th e stringent regulations for PVC 
production that were introduced in western Europe a nd the USA in the 1970s could not be 
met for socioeconomic reasons, and large plants wit h old-fashioned technologies con-
tinued to function with concentrations of VCM that remained at levels of former 
standards (Hozo et al ., 1996).  
In vinyl chloride production, workers may be expose d to ethylene dichloride and to 
catalysts such as iron(III) chloride. In PVC produc tion, concurrent exposure to PVC dust 
may occur (Casula et al. , 1977).  The polymerization inhibitor bisphenol-A has been 
reported to leach from polycarbonate flasks during autoclaving (Krishnan et al. , 1993).  
(b) PVC processing  
Measured levels of VCM in plants where PVC was bein g processed are considerably 
lower than those in vinyl chloride and PVC producin g plants (Table 3; WHO, 1999). 
Improvements in PVC production in the 1970s resulte d in a much lower content of 
residual VCM in PVC resin. The lower monomer conten t led automatically to concen-
trations in the ambient air of PVC processing facto ries < 0.1 ppm [0.26 mg/m 3] (Holm et 
al ., 1982). 
In PVC processing, the polymer may be mixed with an tixodants (such as 
p-nonylphenol), stabilizers (such as organic tin com pounds), plasticizers (phthalates) and 
colouring agents (pigments) (reviewed in Summers, 2 006) and occupational exposure to 
these compounds, as well as to PVC dust, may occur (Boraiko & Batt, 2005). 
1.3.3  Environmental occurrence 
(a) Ambient air 
Vinyl chloride has been reported in landfill gas an d groundwater as a degradation 
product of chlorinated solvents that were deposited  in landfills (WHO, 1999). 
In recent years, the industrial release of vinyl ch loride into the air in the USA slowly 
decreased from 734 259 pounds [333 tonnes] in 2001 to 670 992 pounds [305 tonnes] in 
2002, 645 804 pounds [293 tonnes] in 2003, 653 837 pounds [297 tonnes] in 2004 and 
545 252 pounds [248 tonnes] in 2005 (National Libra ry of Medicine, 2007). 320 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

Atmospheric concentrations of VCM in ambient air ar e low (usually < 3 µg/m 3). A 
monitoring programme in the 1970s that measured VCM  in the air around vinyl chloride 
and PVC production plants found some relatively high concen trations of vinyl chloride in 
ambient air. Maximum 24-h average concentrations ra nged from 0.32 to 10.6 ppm [0.8–
28 mg/m 3]. Levels of VCM were much lower in the vicinity of  PVC product manu-
facturing plants than near vinyl chloride and PVC p roduction plants (Dimmick, 1981). 
(b) Accidental releases 
In June 1996, 10 of 18 tank wagons filled with viny l chloride were derailed on the 
Magdeburg–Halle railway line just outside the Schön ebeck station in Germany. One 
wagon exploded and four others ignited; 28 people r eceived in-patient treatment in a 
nearby hospital and 268 others were treated as outp atients. Vinyl chloride concentrations 
of 0.06–8 ppm [0.16–20.8 mg/m 3] were measured in residential areas. Almost 300 ur ine 
samples that were taken from rescue workers, reside nts and a control group were analysed 
for the vinyl chloride metabolite thiodiacetic acid . The measured values appeared to be in 
the range of those of unexposed people (Thriene et al ., 2000). 
(c) Residues in PVC resin and products 
PVC products contain VCM as a residue from producti on (WHO, 1999). In a survey 
from 1976 to 1977, the following articles contained  VCM at levels > 0.05 ppm 
[0.13 mg/m 3]: bathroom tiles, piping, plastic bottles for tabl e oil and kitchen wrapping 
film. The highest concentrations were found in viny l music records. The VCM content of 
toys, kitchen utensils, food wrappings, wallpaper a nd car interiors was < 0.05 ppm 
(German Environmental Office, 1978). The introducti on of improved manufacturing 
practices has considerably reduced the residual con tent of VCM in PVC products (WHO, 
1999).  
(d) Other occurrences 
VCM was identified in mainstream smoke of cigarette s (1.3–16 ng/cigarette) and 
cigars (14–27 ng/cigar). The measured levels correl ated with chloride content of the 
tobacco (Hoffmann et al ., 1976; IARC, 2004). 
There has been no report of vinyl chloride levels f ound in food, pharmaceutical or 
cosmetic products in recent years (WHO, 1999). 
1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
Historically, the American Conference of Government In dustrial Hygienists threshold 
limit values (ACGIH TLV ) were lowered from a maximum allowed concentration –
time-weighted average (MAC–TWA) of 500 ppm in 1946– 47 to a TLV–TWA of 200 
ppm in 1972. In 1978–79, the carcinogenic classific ation A1c was added. In 1980, a 322 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 TLV–TWA value of 5 ppm was recommended together with the carcinogen classification 
of A1c, which changed to A1a and then to A1 in 1987 . In 1999, a TLV–TWA value of 1 
ppm was accepted with the A1 carcinogen classificat ion (ACGIH, 2001). 
Many countries, regions or organizations have estab lished exposure guidelines for 
vinyl chloride in the workplace (Table 4). 
The international, national and state regulations a nd guidelines regarding vinyl 
chloride in air, water and other media have been su mmarized by ATSDR (2006).  
Since 1978, the European Union has controlled the p resence of vinyl chloride in 
polymers and copolymers that are intended to come i nto contact with food (78/142/EEC; 
European Commission, 1978).

2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Case reports  
A case report of three cases of angiosarcoma of the  liver in men who had been 
employed in the manufacture of PVC resins provided the first evidence of an association 
between vinyl chloride and cancer in humans (Creech  & Johnson, 1974). The case report 
was particularly informative because of the rarity of the tumour. Case reports of hepato-
cellular carcinoma in workers exposed to vinyl chlo ride have been published since the 
mid-1970s in France (Saurin  et al. , 1997), Germany (Gokel et al. , 1976; Koischwitz  et al. , 
1981; Dietz  et al. , 1985; Lelbach, 1996; Weihrauch  et al ., 2000), China (Hong Kong 
SAR) (Evans  et al. , 1983), Italy (Pirastu  et al. , 1990), Japan (Makita  et al. , 1997) and the 
USA (Bond  et al. , 1990).  324 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 2.2 Methods and main results of epidemiological cohort studies of  workers 
exposed to vinyl chloride  
Two epidemiological multicentric investigations of workers who were employed in 
the vinyl chloride industry have been carried out: one in North America and one in 
Europe. In addition to reports that related to thes e cohorts in their entirety, a number of 
studies reported findings from individual subcohort s. In this section, results for subcohorts 
are described only when they provide important info rmation that is not available in 
analyses of the full cohorts. Six cohort studies ha ve also been reported in addition to and 
separately from the two multicentric investigations . 
2.2.1  North American multicentric study 
The North American multicentric cohort was originally as sembled under the sponsor-
ship of the Chemical Manufacturers’ Association (no w known as the American Chemis-
try Council). The first published report of this st udy (Cooper, 1981) included 10 173 
workers from 37 plants, whose vital status was upda ted through to 31 December 1972. 
Among the 37 plants included in the study, 11 plant s with 1214 workers produced only 
VCM, 18 plants with 6848 workers produced only PVC,  three plants with 935 workers 
produced both VCM and PVC and five plants with 1176  workers produced homo-
polymers and copolymers. To be eligible for inclusi on into the cohort, male employees at 
the 37 participating plants were required to have been exp osed to VCM for at least 1 year 
before 31 December 1972 and to have been employed in or after  1942. The time at which 
the employees were included in the study depended o n the date at which the plant where 
they worked began making or using VCM and the earli est date at which personnel 
records were complete for all employees, whichever was later. A second major follow-up 
of this cohort was published by Wong et al.  (1991), at which time vital status had been 
updated through to 31 December 1989; this update inc luded 10 173 individuals who satis-
fied the original entry criteria for this study. A third major update included the same 
eligibility criteria; after minor corrections to st udy records, 10 109 subjects were included 
in the analysis and vital status was updated throug h to 31 December 1995 (Mundt  et al. , 
2000). On the basis of state reference rates, the s tandardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 
0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80–0.86) for all causes, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90–1.03) 
for all malignant neoplasms and 3.59 (80 deaths; 95 % CI, 2.84–4.46) for cancer of the 
liver and biliary tract. Results for cancer at othe r sites were given for brain and central 
nervous system (36 deaths; SMR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.00– 1.97), lung (303 deaths; SMR, 
0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.92), lymphatic and haematopoeitic t issue (71 observed; SMR, 0.86; 
95% CI, 0.67–1.08), lymphosarcoma and reticulosarco ma (International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD)-9 code 200; 12 deaths; SMR, 1.20; 95 % CI, 0.62–2.09) and skin (ICD-9 
code 172–173; 12 deaths; SMR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.33–1. 12).  
A separate analysis for a plant located in Louisvil le, KY (USA), that was included in 
the  multicentric cohort was published by Lewis  et al.  (2003). The plant was the site at  VINYL CHLORIDE 325  
 
 which an excess of deaths from angiosarcoma had fir st been detected in workers exposed 
to vinyl chloride; it had opened in 1942 and has pr oduced VCM, PVC resin and nitrile 
rubber copolymers. Among 2200 workers who had been employed for at least 1 year in 
jobs that entailed exposure to VCM in 1942–72 and w ho were followed-up during 1942–
95, mortality from all causes was below that expect ed (903 deaths versus 1008.8 ex-
pected; SMR, 0.88), while that for all cancers comb ined was above expectation (264 
deaths versus 248.2 expected; SMR, 1.06); mortality  from cancer of the liver and biliary 
tract was also greater than that expected (24 death s versus six expected; SMR, 4.00).  
A subsequent study at this plant compared the expos ure histories of cases of liver 
angiosarcoma and brain cancer with those of 1817 wo rkers who had been exposed for at 
least 1 year and had been hired before 1967 (Lewis & Rempala, 2003). Exposure 
variables included history of employment in various  PVC and nitrile rubber production 
buildings, ranked peak exposure to VCM and estimate d cumulative exposure to VCM, 
acrylonitrile (IARC, 1999), 1,3-butadiene (see this  volume) and styrene (IARC, 2002). In 
a nested case–control study, each case was individu ally matched to controls by year of 
birth, year of hire and duration of employment. The  matched case–control analysis con-
sidered ranked exposure to VCM, vinylidene chloride  (IARC, 1999), vinyl acetate 
(IARC, 1995), PVC, acrylonitrile (IARC, 1999), 1,3- butadiene (see this volume) and 
styrene (IARC, 2002). The occurrence of angiosarcom a was strongly associated with 
exposure to vinyl chloride but not with exposure to  the other chemicals; the risk for brain 
cancer was highest among workers who had been hired  before 1950 but was not 
associated with exposure to vinyl chloride.  
2.2.2  European multicentric study 
The European multicentric cohort was conducted in f our countries (Italy, Norway, 
Sweden and the United Kingdom). The first report of  the study results (Simonato et al ., 
1991) included follow-up of vital status through to  31 December 1986; an update of the 
study (Ward et al ., 2001) analysed incidence and mortality through t o the latest year for 
which data were available in each country, which ra nged between 1993 and 1997. The 
study included a total of 19 factories; 11 of these  produced VCM/PVC, two produced 
VCM only, five produced PVC only and one was a PVC processing plant. Male workers 
who had been employed for at least 1 year in 1942–7 2 in jobs that entailed exposure to 
VCM were included. The observation period for the c ohort began in 1955, the year for 
which reference rates were first available. The mos t recent report provided updated 
information on vital status for 17 of the 19 factor ies and on cancer incidence for 13 
factories in three countries. In addition, results for most of the national cohorts were 
published separately (Byren et al. , 1976; Fox & Collier, 1977; Molina et al. , 1981; 
Heldaas et al. , 1984, 1987; Jones et al. , 1988; Hagmar et al. , 1990; Pirastu et al. , 1990, 
1998; Lang ărd et al. , 2000). 
Of the 12 700 men included in the updated analysis of the full cohort (Ward et al ., 
2001), 9688 (76.3%) were alive (range by country, 6 6–89%), 2665 (21.0%; range by 326 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 country, 10–33%) had died, 63 (0.5%) were lost to f ollow-up and 284 (2.2%) had 
emigrated. Overall, the follow-up was 97.3% complet e. 
Age- and calendar period-specific (men only) nation al mortality rates were used as 
the reference for the SMR analysis. These were comp uted using the WHO mortality 
database, in which only three-digit ICD codes have been stored consistently since 1955. A 
search for the best available data for a diagnosis of liver cancer was conducted by 
reviewing all available documentation. For Sweden a nd Norway, this included histology 
on the death certificate, if noted, and morphology coded by the cancer registry. For Italy, 
where cancer registry data were not available, info rmation was obtained from the death 
certificate or from medical records. In the United Kingdom, sources of histological diag-
nosis included the death certificate, cancer regist ry, medical records and a registry of 
angiosarcomas developed by the Health and Safety Ex ecutive (Baxter, 1981). Records of 
cases of liver cancer from all of the countries wer e also matched by indirect identifiers to 
records of an angiosarcoma registry maintained by t he Association of European Plastics 
Manufacturers (Forman et al. , 1985). 
Analysis by production process was based on the typ e of plant. The majority of 
workers (8032) were employed in mixed VCM/PVC produ ction facilities, followed by 
PVC production (3047), PVC processing (1353) and VC M production (206). Calendar 
period-specific job–exposure matrices were provided b y industrial hygienists for 13 of the 
19 factories, and matrices that provided job- and c alendar time-specific estimates of 
exposure to vinyl chloride in parts per million wer e created. Each job–exposure matrix 
was checked and validated as being generally accura te by two other industrial hygienists, 
one from Sweden and one from the United Kingdom, bo th of whom had had several 
years of experience in the vinyl chloride industry.  
In general, exposure estimates for the study plants w ere highest in the earliest years of 
operation. For example, estimates of exposure to VC M in the highest exposure categories, 
including reactor operators, were as high as > 500 ppm [> 1300 mg/m 3] in 1950–65 in 
several of the Italian plants, 2000 ppm [5200 mg/m 3] in 1950–54 in a Norwegian plant, 
approximately 3000 ppm [7800 mg/m 3] in 1940–44 in one of the Swedish plants and 
770 ppm [2000 mg/m 3] in 1944–50 in one of the British plants. Exposure  estimates for 
high-exposure jobs in the 1960s were substantially lower in most plants, and the majority 
were below 200 ppm [520 mg/m 3]. By the mid-1970s, very few plants had estimated ex-
posures > 5 ppm [> 13 mg/m 3]. Exposure variables in the analysis were autoclav e worker 
(ever/never), duration of employment, and ranked le vel of exposure and cumulative ex-
posure to VCM in air in ppm–years. Exposures to vin yl chloride in the study plants were 
estimated to be < 1 ppm [< 2.6 mg/m 3] for all jobs between 1976 and 1988. Most factorie s 
had a specific job category for autoclave workers, and the classification of individuals as 
‘ever autoclave worker’ was based on ever having he ld a job in this category. For these 
workers, three categories were created: 1, known to  have been an autoclave worker; 2, not 
known to have been an autoclave worker, and from a factory with a specific job code for 
autoclave worker; and 3, from a factory in which wo rk as an autoclave worker could not 
be determined.  VINYL CHLORIDE 327  
 
 In addition to the job–exposure matrix with job- an d calendar time-specific estimated 
exposures to vinyl chloride in parts per million, a n index of ranked level of exposure was 
developed. Classification of subjects in this index  was based on the maximum exposure 
level for any job held by an individual, based on t he job- and the calendar time-specific 
exposure estimates given for that job in the job–ex posure matrix. In order to examine the 
potential association of exposure to PVC dust with lung cancer and non-malignant respi-
ratory disease, stratified analyses were conducted for those workers who had only, ever or 
never been employed in curing, filtering and packin g jobs. 
Using national mortality and incidence rates as the  reference, mortality from all 
causes (SMR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82–0.88) and from all cancers (SMR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93–
1.06) was below the reference, as was total cancer incidenc e (standardized incidence ratio 
[SIR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79–0.91). An increase in the  occurrence of primary liver cancer 
was observed (53 deaths and 29 incident cases; SMR,  2.40; 95% CI, 1.80–3.14; SIR, 
3.98; 95% CI, 2.67–5.72). From the best available d ata on diagnosis, 71 cases of liver 
cancer were identified and used in the internal ana lysis for latency, duration of employ-
ment, cumulative exposure and employment as autocla ve cleaner. On the same basis, 37 
cases of angiosarcoma and 10 cases of hepatocellula r carcinoma were ascertained for 
which detailed analyses of latency, duration of exp osure, cumulative exposure and ever 
versus never  having worked as an autoclave cleaner were conducte d. The results of these 
internal analyses are presented in Section 2.3. Res ults for other cancer sites (Ward et al ., 
2001) were: brain cancer — SMR, 0.93 (24 deaths; 95 % CI, 0.60–1.39) and SIR, 0.91 (19 
cases; 95% CI, 0.55–1.42); lung cancer — SMR, 0.95 (272 deaths; 95% CI, 0.84–1.07) 
and SIR, 0.80 (154 cases; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94); and l ymphatic and haematopoeitic cancer 
— SMR, 0.94 (62 deaths; 95% CI, 0.72–1.21) [SIR not  reported]; no significant excess 
was reported in any category of leukaemia or lympho ma. A non-significantly elevated 
SMR was found for malignant melanoma (15 deaths; SMR, 1.60;  95% CI, 0.90–2.65) but 
the analysis of incidence did not show an excess (1 8 observed cases; SIR, 1.06; 95% CI, 
0.63–1.68) (Ward et al ., 2001). Results of internal analyses for selected  sites are presented 
in Sections 2.3–2.9. 
The European study found evidence of a significant association between exposure to 
VCM and mortality from liver cirrhosis. The relativ e risks for cumulative exposures of 
< 524 (reference), 524–998, 999–3429, 3430–5148 and  ≥ 5149 ppm–years were 1.00, 
9.38 (eight cases; 95% CI, 3.52–25.0), 4.01 (nine c ases; 95% CI, 1.55–10.4), 9.77 (eight 
cases; 95% CI, 3.66–26.1) and 8.28 (nine cases; 95%  CI, 3.15–21.8), respectively.  
In a Swedish study of 2031 workers employed for ≥ 3 months in a PVC processing 
plant during 1961–80 (Hagmar  et al. , 1990), mortality and cancer incidence in 1961–85 
were studied; vital status was established for 95.5 % of cohort members. Work activities 
were classified for estimated exposure to VCM as no ne, low, moderate or high. The 
cohort was later included in the European multicentric st udy. The incidence of all cancers 
was higher than expected (SIR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.99–1 .36). Two incident cases of cancer 
of the liver and biliary tract were observed among workers w ith 10 or more years latency, 
an incidence that was higher than expected (SIR, 2. 44; 95% CI, 0.30–8.80).  328 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 A Swedish cohort of 717 workers who had been employ ed for ≥ 3 months in three 
PVC processing plants in 1964–74 was followed up fo r mortality in 1964–86 and for 
incidence of disease in 1964–84; work activities we re classified as having high, inter-
mediate or low potential exposure to VCM and nation al reference rates were used for 
comparison. Mortality from all causes was as expect ed (SMR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8–1.2), and 
no cases of liver cancer were observed (Lundberg  et al. , 1993).  
A prospective follow-up study of French VCM workers  was initiated in 1980 
(Laplanche et al ., 1992). The study population included exposed and  unexposed workers 
from 12 plants; 1096 employees, aged 44–55 years, h ad been exposed to VCM in 1980–
81 or earlier and were free of disease at the time of enrolment; the unexposed group 
included 1093 employees who were individually match ed to the exposed group by age, 
plant and plant physician. Interviews and data coll ection were conducted by plant physi-
cians. Occupational and medical histories, parental  history of cancer, employment status, 
nationality, tobacco smoking status and alcoholic b everage consumption were recorded. 
The follow-up period ended in December 1988. During  the study period, 20 deaths from 
cancer were observed among the exposed and 22 among  the unexposed. Cancer mor-
bidity was higher among the exposed (38 cases obser ved) than the unexposed (32 cases 
observed; relative risk, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8–2.1).  
In an Italian plant in Porto Marghera that was incl uded in the European multicentric 
study, an internal analysis was completed with mort ality follow-up for 1972–95 and 
employment histories for 1972–85 (Gennaro et al ., 2003). The relative risks for mortality 
from all causes and all cancers for autoclave worke rs versus all other workers were 1.32 
(11 deaths; 95% CI, 0.55–3.15) and 1.09 (six deaths ; 95% CI, 0.36–3.31), respectively; an 
increase was also observed for mortality from liver cancer (four deaths; relative risk, 9.57; 
95% CI, 1.69–54.1).  
In the same plant, mortality and occupational history were updated until 1999 (Pirastu  
et al. , 2003). On the basis of job- and time-specific exp osure estimates, cumulative 
exposure was calculated and classified into six exp osure categories (0–735, 735–2379, 
2379–5188, 5188–7531 and 7531–9400 ppm–years); emplo yment as an autoclave worker 
(ever/never) was also considered in the analyses. D ata (clinical and pathological) that 
gave the best diagnosis were used to identify cases  of liver angiosarcoma and hepato-
cellular carcinoma. Regional rates were used as a r eference, mortality from primary liver 
cancer was determined and internal analyses for dur ation, latency and exposure were 
completed. A comparison of mortality in the cohort with local reference rates was made 
for all causes (SMR, 0.75; 90% CI, 0.68–0.83) and a ll cancers (SMR, 0.94; 90% CI, 
0.81–1.09), both of which were lower than expected.  For all causes, the analysis by time 
since leaving employment and adjusted for latency s howed that the SMR in the first year 
after leaving employment was 2.76 (90% CI, 1.94–3.9 1). Mortality rates for liver angio-
sarcoma (six cases) increased with latency and cumu lative exposure; no cases were asso-
ciated with duration of employment of < 12 years, l atency of < 10 years or cumulative 
exposure of < 2379 ppm–years. Mortality rates for h epatocellular carcinoma (12 cases) 
and liver cirrhosis (20 cases) showed a similar pat tern.    VINYL CHLORIDE 329  
 
 A cross-sectional study in the same plant examined occupational and non-occupa-
tional risk factors for cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma among 13 indi-
viduals who had liver cancer (eight confirmed histo logically), 40 individuals who had 
liver cirrhosis (24 confirmed histologically) and 1 39 referents who had been examined in 
a medical surveillance programme in 1999–2002 and w ere found not to have had any 
evidence of liver disease or cancer at any site (Ma strangelo et al ., 2004). Among the 13 
cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 11 also had live r cirrhosis and were included in both 
groups. [The Working Group noted that it was not cl ear how the 139 referent subjects 
with no evidence of liver disease were selected fro m among the 643 persons examined in 
the medical surveillance programme.] Exposure to VC M was evaluated using a job–
exposure matrix developed by Pirastu et al . (1990); history of alcoholic beverage con-
sumption was ascertained from clinical or health su rveillance records and chronic infec-
tion with hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C virus wa s examined by serological markers. An 
association between exposure to VCM and both liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carci-
noma was found with much higher odds ratios among t hose exposed to multiple risk 
factors.  
2.2.3  Other studies 
A proportionate mortality study of workers employed  in 1964–73 at 55 PVC pro-
cessing plants in the USA used national mortality r ates for comparison; six deaths from 
primary liver cancer were observed versus an expect ed 4.19 (Chiazze & Ference, 1981).  
Thériault and Allard (1981) compared the mortality of a small cohort of 451 male 
workers who had been employed for 5 or more years i n 1948–72 in a Canadian VCM 
production and polymerization plant with that of a group of 870 workers who had been 
employed for ≥ 5 months at a nearby industrial complex that was n ot involved in the 
production of VCM or PVC and who were considered to be unex posed, and also with the 
mortality of the Québec general population in 1971. Occ upational histories were obtained 
by interview either at home or at work with the wor ker himself or his next of kin. Vital 
status was ascertained as at the end of 1977. The r elative risk for exposed versus un-
exposed workers for mortality from all causes was 1 .48 (95% CI, 0.84–2.61). Eight cases 
of liver cancer were observed with only 0.14 expect ed in comparison with the general 
population; all of these were angiosarcomas. Two de aths from cancer of the ‘bone, skin, 
connective tissue’ (ICD codes 170–173) were observe d compared with 0.38 expected.  
Weber et al . (1981) reported findings in a historical cohort o f 7021 VCM/PVC 
production workers in Germany. The cohort included German a nd Austrian men who had 
been employed from the beginning of VCM/PVC product ion in all German plants [no 
details given] to the end of 1974. Vital status and  follow-up for cause of death [methods 
not described] were 93.2% and 92.7% complete, respe ctively. Mortality rates of the West 
German male population were used as the reference. To calculate expected numbers for 
person–years of observation before 1968, rates from 1968 were used. A method described 
by Tabershaw and Gaffey (1974) was used to take int o account unknown causes of 330 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 deaths. No information on exposure levels was avail able. The SMRs for mortality from 
all causes, all cancers and liver cancer (ICD-8 155 ) were 0.95 (414 deaths), 1.12 (94 
deaths) and 15.23 (12 deaths), respectively. [The W orking Group noted that an earlier 
cohort studied by Frentzel-Beyme et al.  (1978) appeared to be included in this cohort.] 
Smulevich et al . (1988) conducted a cohort study at the oldest PVC  plants in the 
former Soviet Union. Overall, 3232 workers (2195 me n) were identified as having held 
jobs that entailed exposure to VCM. Exposure levels  were greater than 300 mg/m 3 
[115 ppm] for part of the cohort [number unspecifie d]. Expected deaths were computed in 
strata of age (15–74 years) from death rates in the  same city, based on follow-up for the 
years 1939–77. The total number of deaths was not i n excess in the cohort. The SMR for 
all cancer was 1.07 (63 deaths). No cases of liver cancer were observed. The proportion of 
the cohort that was ever exposed to the highest est imated levels of VCM was not 
reported; however, 40 of 63 cancer deaths occurred in the high-exposure category. A 
statistically significant excess ( p < 0.05) was detected for leukaemias and lymphomas 
(five deaths; SMR, 4.17), while excess mortality fr om for pancreatic cancer in both sexes 
(SMR, 1.43) and skin cancer (both melanoma and non- melanoma) in men (SMR, 1.67) 
were not statistically significant. Histological co nfirmation of causes of death was avail-
able for 60% of the cancer cases. A significant inc rease in the occurrence of lymphomas 
and leukaemias (seven deaths; SMR, 6.36) was noted at the highest level of exposure 
(p < 0.05). Although the number of cohort members per  exposure level was not reported, 
28 cancer deaths occurred in the highest-exposure g roup, 15 in the intermediate (30–
300 mg/m 3 [11.5–115 ppm])-exposure group and one in the lowe st (< 30 mg/m3 
[11.5 ppm])-exposure group. [The Working Group note d that few details were provided 
on the methods used for the computation of expected  numbers of deaths.] 
Du and Wang (1998) conducted a proportionate morbid ity study in Taiwan, China, at 
five PVC plants that were operational in 1989–95. T he 2224 workers who had been 
exposed to VCM (97% of the total) and who were trac ed were compared with two other 
cohorts who were unexposed to VCM—one of optical wo rkers and one of motorcycle 
manufacturers (work histories were ascertained from  records of the Labour Insurance 
Bureau). Hospital admissions for cancer at several sites were compared with admissions 
for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as r eference conditions and morbidity odds 
ratios were calculated. An excess of primary liver cancer was noted (morbidity odds ratio, 
4.5; 95% CI, 1.5–13.3; or 6.5; 95% CI, 2.3–18.4, de pending on the comparison cohort). 
An excess of deaths from haematopoietic cancer (mor bidity odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.0–
11.8) was seen. Overall, 12 cases of primary liver cancer were observed in the PVC 
workers, including six hepatocellular carcinomas an d six with unknown histology. [The 
Working Group noted that in a morbidity study, as in a propor tionate mortality study, risk 
estimates may be influenced by differences in the o ccurrence of the reference diseases as 
well as those of the disease of interest.]  
Wong, O. et al . (2002) conducted a retrospective mortality study of a cohort of 
workers from six vinyl chloride polymerization fact ories in Taiwan, China. A total of 
3293 male workers met the eligibility criteria for the study: they must have been em- VINYL CHLORIDE 331  
 
 ployed for at least 1 year between 1 January 1950 a nd 31 December 1992 and have been 
alive on 1 January 1985. The workers were followed for ascertainment of vital status from 
1 January 1985 to 31 December 1997 through a nation al mortality registry. More than 
99% of the study subjects was successfully traced u sing this method, and the remaining 
1% was excluded from the analysis. SMRs were estimated using  national rates for men as 
the reference. Exposure to VCM was estimated to be about 500 ppm [1300 mg/m 3] in the 
1960s based on a previous report (Du et al ., 2001). The SMR for all causes was 0.78 
(95% CI, 0.65–0.91) and the number of deaths from f or all cancers combined was greater 
than that expected (SMR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.99–1.69). A significant excess of mortality 
from liver cancer was observed in this study (25 ca ses; SMR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15–2.62). 
None of the deaths from liver cancer appeared to be  due to angiosarcoma, although 
diagnosis of primary liver cancer was only histolog ically confirmed for five cases.  
A study on risk factors for hepatocellular carcinom a was conducted at six PVC 
polymerization plants in Taiwan, China, an area tha t has a high prevalence of chronic 
HBV and hepatitis C virus infection and an associat ed high incidence of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (Wong et al ., 2003a). Among a cohort of 4096 workers, 25 cases  of liver 
cancer were diagnosed in 1985–97. Of the 18 cases o f liver cancer for whom medical 
records were available, all were considered to be h epatocellular carcinomas, although 
only five were confirmed histopathologically. Four control subjects were selected from 
among a pool of eligible workers who had known HBV status, no evidence of liver 
disease and provided information on questionnaires.  Indices of exposure to VCM were 
developed based on job titles. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative subjects with 
history of tank cleaning had a 4.0-fold greater ris k for liver cancer (95% CI, 0.2–69.1). 
HBsAg carriers with no history of tank cleaning had  a 25.7-fold (95% CI, 2.9–229.4) 
increased risk, whereas the HBsAg carriers with a h istory of tank cleaning had the 
greatest risk (odds ratio, 396.0; 95% CI, 22.6– ∞), which suggested an interaction between 
occupational exposure to VCM and HBV infections for  the development of liver cancer.  
A meta-analysis of cohort studies of vinyl choride- exposed workers that had been 
published up to 2002 was conducted (Boffetta et al. , 2003). The meta-analysis was based 
on eight independent studies, two multicentric inves tigations (Mundt et al ., 2000; Ward et 
al .,  2001) and six smaller additional studies (Thériault  & Allard, 1981; Weber et al ., 
1981; Smulevich et al. , 1988; Laplanche et al. , 1992; Huang, 1996; Wong, O. et al .,  
2002). For a selection of cancer sites, a meta-SMR and 95% CIs were calculated using a 
random-effects model when the p-value for the test for heterogeneity was ≥ 0.01. Six of 
eight studies reported results for liver cancer, bu t these were considered to be too hetero-
geneous to be included in a meta-analysis because, for both liver cancer overall and for 
liver cancer other than angiosarcoma, the p value for heterogeneity was < 0.001. For the 
two multicentric studies (Mundt et al ., 2000; Ward et al .,  2001), the lack of heterogeneity 
allowed the calculation of meta-SMRs of 2.96 (95% C I, 2.00–4.39) for liver cancer 
overall ( p value for heterogeneity = 0.03) and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.04–4.39) for liver cancer 
other than angiosarcoma ( p value for heterogeneity = 0.7). [The Working Group  noted 
that the meta-analysis did not evaluate the quality  of the studies and that some 332 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 heterogeneity between studies may have resulted fro m variable data quality. Excluding 
one study in China, other studies reported SMRs tha t ranged from 1.78 (95% CI, 1.15–
2.62) to 57.1 (95% CI, 24.6–113) for liver cancer o verall and from 1.27 (95% CI, 0.84–
1.83) to 10.1 (95% CI, 4.37–20.0) for liver cancer other than angiosarcoma.]  
2.3 Cancer of the liver 
2.3.1  Cohort studies (Table 5) 
(a) North American multicentric study   
The most recent update of the multicentric cohort s tudy of men in the North Amer-
ican vinyl chloride industry (Mundt  et al. , 2000) and reports relative to previous follow-
up periods for the same cohort (Tabershaw & Gaffey,  1974; Cooper, 1981; Wong  et al. , 
1991) found, on the basis of state reference rates,  an SMR for cancer of the liver and 
biliary tract of 3.59 (80 deaths; 95% CI, 2.84–4.46 ). SMRs increased with increasing 
duration of exposure: 0.83 (95% CI, 0.33–1.71), 2.1 5 (95% CI, 1.03–3.96), 6.79 (95% CI, 
4.83–9.29) and 6.88 (95% CI, 4.40–10.23) for 1–4, 5 –9, 10–19 and ≥ 20 years, respec-
tively; and latency: 2.87 (95% CI, 1.31–5.44), 3.23  (95% CI, 2.00–4.93) and 4.34 (95% 
CI, 3.22–5.72) for 10–19, 20–29 and ≥ 30 years, respectively. In the Cox’s proportional 
hazard model, duration of exposure had the strongest independent and significant effect in 
comparison with age and year of first exposure; adj usting for age and year of first ex-
posure, and using 1–4 years as the reference, the r elative risk values for 5–9, 10–19 and 
≥ 20 years of duration were 2.8 (95% CI, 1.0–7.3), 9 .0 (95% CI, 4.0–20.7) and 6.0 (95% 
CI, 2.5–14.4), respectively. For a total of 48 case s of angiosarcoma identified from both 
death certificates and the World Angiosarcoma Regis try, Cox’s proportional hazard anal-
ysis, adjusting for age and year of first exposure, showed an increase in risk for increasing 
duration of exposure: using 1–4 years duration as t he reference, the relative risks for 5–9, 
10–19 and ≥ 20 years of duration were 3.7 (95% CI, 0.9–14.7), 15.9 (95% CI, 4.6–54.8) 
and 9.7 (95% CI, 2.6–36.4), respectively. [It is no t known whether the 32 deaths from 
liver cancer that were not identified as angiosarco ma were angiosarcoma or hepatocellular 
carcinoma; however, the number of expected deaths f rom liver and biliary tract cancer 
was 22.30.] 
In a separate analysis of one plant located in Louis ville, KY (USA), that was included 
in the  multicentric cohort (Lewis  et al. , 2003), mortality from cancer of the liver and 
biliary tract was higher than that expected on the basis of local rates (24 observed deaths 
versus six expected; SMR, 4.00). The analysis showe d that SMRs for cancer of the liver 
and biliary tract increased with increasing duratio n of exposure (durations of 10–19 and 
≥ 20 years had SMRs of 10.85 and 3.64, respectively;  p < 0.05 for both categories) and 
latency (latencies of 10–19, 20–29 and ≥ 30 years had SMRs of 6.49, 6.94 and 2.55, 
respectively; p < 0.05 for all three categories). In this plant, a total of 28 liver angio-
sarcomas, 18 from deaths from liver cancer and 10 f rom other causes of death, were 
identified.   VINYL CHLORIDE 333

 (b) European studies 
In the European multicentric cohort study of worker s in the vinyl chloride industry, an 
increase in the incidence of primary liver cancer wa s observed (53 deaths and 29 incident 
cases; SMR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.80–3.14; SIR, 3.98; 95% CI, 2.67–5.72) using national 
mortality and incidence rates as the reference. On the basis of the best available data for 
diagnosis, 71 cases of liver cancer were identified  and used in the internal analysis for 
latency, duration of employment, cumulative exposur e and employment as an autoclave 
cleaner. The risk increased with increasing duratio n and latency of employment with a 
significant trend (for both latency and duration, p <  0.001). For durations of exposure of 
10–16, 17–20, 21–25 and ≥ 26 years (1–9 years as the reference), the relativ e risks for 
liver cancer were 2.58 (95% CI, 1.28–5.24), 3.48 (9 5% CI, 1.49–8.15), 8.21 (95% CI, 
3.98–16.9) and 9.39 (95% CI, 4.17–21.1), respective ly. For latencies of 21–25, 26–30, 
31–36 and ≥ 37 years (0–20 years as reference), the relative r isks were 2.44 (95% CI, 
1.09–5.45), 2.99 (95% CI, 1.26–7.09), 5.58 (95% CI, 2.34–13.3) and 6.20 (95% CI, 2.30–
16.7), respectively. The trend was also significant  for cumulative exposure ( p <  0.001); 
the risk was almost four times that for the referen ce category (0–734 ppm–years) starting 
with cumulative exposures of 735–1379 ppm–years (re lative risk, 3.97; 95% CI, 1.81–
8.71); for 2380–5188, 5189–7531 and ≥ 7532 ppm–years, the relative risks were 7.55 
(95% CI, 3.57–15.9), 14.0 (95% CI, 6.43–30.7) and 2 8.27 (95% CI, 12.84–62.25), respec-
tively. Analysis of the exposure–response trends at  low doses (defined as < 1500 ppm–
years and thus including 20 cases of liver cancer) yielded a relative risk of 2.0 (95% CI, 
1.3–3.0) for one logarithmic unit of cumulative dos e. From the best available data for 
diagnosis, 37 cases of angiosarcoma were ascertaine d for which a significant increasing 
trend ( p <  0.001) was observed for latency, duration of expos ure and cumulative expo-
sure; for ever versus never  autoclave cleaners, the relative risk was 25.5 (95%  CI, 8.86–
73.2). Ten cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were a lso used in the internal analysis. For 
latency and duration of exposure, the trend in risk  was significant ( p =  0.001 and 
p = 0.002, respectively); the risk was also significan t for 7532 ppm–years of cumulative 
exposure (relative risk, 20.27; 95% CI, 2.98–137.71 ; p =  0.004); for ever versus never  
having been an autoclave cleaner, the relative risk  was 2.97 (95% CI, 0.80–11.1).  
In the study of the Porto Marghera plant in Italy ( Pirastu  et al. , 2003), mortality from 
primary liver cancer was higher than that expected from regional rates (SMR, 2.78; 90% 
CI, 1.86–4.14). In an internal comparison, death ra tes for primary liver cancer with laten-
cies of 10–30 years (26.1/100 000) and ≥ 30 years (160.7/100 000) were higher than those 
for the reference (latency ≤ 10 years). In the internal analysis for employment  as an auto-
clave worker (ever/never), the relative risk was 4.4  (90% CI, 1.9–10.0); a significant increasing 
trend was seen for increasing cumulative estimated exposure ( p <0.001). The analyses of rates 
for both liver angiosarcoma (six cases) and hepatoc ellular carcinoma (12 cases) showed that 
longer latency implied higher rates; employment as an autoclave worker (ever/never) was 
associated with an increased risk for both angiosar coma (relative risk, 21.1; 90% CI, 3.5–344 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 128.7) and hepatocellular carcinoma (relative risk,  3.5; 90% CI, 1.4–9.2); for both histo-
types, there was a significant increasing trend wit h increasing estimated exposure ( p < 0.001). 
In the same plant (Porto Marghera), an analysis tha t used internal reference groups 
(Gennaro et al ., 2003) showed that the relative risk for mortalit y from liver cancer of 
autoclave workers versus all other workers was 9.57  (four deaths; 95% CI, 1.69–54.1); for 
two job title groups, ‘compound workers’ and ‘compo und + autoclave + PVC bagger 
workers’, the relative risks were 3.44 (four deaths ; 95% CI, 0.62–18.97) and 4.08 (nine 
deaths; 95% CI, 0.85–19.57), respectively. 
(c) Other studies 
In the Canadian cohort study (Thériault & Allard, 1 981), histopathological confir-
mation was available from medical files at the hospitals fo r 19 of 20 causes of death from 
cancer: eight were angiosarcomas of the liver. Two more ang iosarcomas of the liver were 
notified as cirrhosis on the death certificate and were considered as such throughout this 
study. In comparison with an unexposed cohort, the relative risk for digestive cancers 
(ICD codes 150–159) was 6.25 (14 observed deaths; 9 5% CI, 2.69–14.52). [No relative 
risks for more specific cancer sites were given.]  
In the study by Weber et al . (1981), the SMRs for liver cancer by duration of expo-
sure for < 12 months, 13–60 months, 61–120 months and  > 121 months were 0, 8.74 (two 
deaths), 15.25 (three deaths) and 25.28 (seven deaths), re spectively. [The Working Group 
noted that an increased mortality from liver cancer  was briefly described in a cohort of 
PVC processing workers. This cohort probably included the  data of Frentzel-Beyme et al . 
(1978).] 
No deaths from liver cancer were reported in PVC pl ants in the former Soviet Union 
(Smulevich  et al. , 1988). 
In the French study (Laplanche et al ., 1992), three angiosarcomas of the liver and 
three liver cancers were observed among the exposed  workers compared with none in the 
unexposed [no relative risk estimates given].  
In a proportionate morbidity study in Taiwan, China  (Du & Wang, 1998), an excess 
of primary liver cancer was noted (morbidity odds r atio, 4.5 or 6.5, depending on the 
comparison group). 
In a retrospective cohort study of mortality in Tai wan, China (Wong, O. et al ., 2002), 
the risk for liver cancer decreased with duration o f exposure; the authors suggested that 
this might be attributable to a higher turnover of workers in jobs that entailed high 
exposures or because workers with illnesses retired  early. The excess mortality from liver 
cancer was most pronounced among workers who began emp loyment before 1970 (SMR, 
4.82; 95% CI, 2.41–8.63), when, according to the au thors, exposures to VCM were 
higher, because permissible exposure limits for VCM  were not established in Taiwan 
until 1981. The excess mortality from liver cancer was found to increase with time since 
first exposure and to reach a peak after more than 25 years (SMR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.50–
5.75). It was also found to be inversely related to age at fi rst exposure; workers who were  VINYL CHLORIDE 345  
 
 under 30 years of age at first exposure demonstrate d the highest risk (SMR, 2.24; 95% CI, 
1.07–4.12). 
A study of risk factors for hepatocellular carcinom a that was conducted in Taiwan, 
China (Wong et al ., 2003a), reported an odds ratio of 15.7 (95% CI, 3 .6–68.4) for HBsAg 
status. An odds ratio of 3.6 (95% CI, 1.4–9.2) was estimated for jobs that entailed high 
exposure to VCM; for tank cleaners specifically, th e odds ratio was 2.9 (95% CI, 1.1–
7.3). [The Working Group noted that, due to problem s in the methodology of this study, 
the results were not considered to be useful for the  evaluation of the potential relationship 
between exposure to vinyl chloride and hepatocellul ar carcinoma. These methodological 
problems included lack of histological confirmation  for the majority of cases of hepato-
cellular carcinoma, the resulting potential that so me of the cases were truly angio-
sarcomas, lack of detail in the methodology for sel ection of controls and exclusion of 
individuals with evidence of liver disease from the  control group.]  
[The Working Group considered that the evidence tha t exposure to VCM is asso-
ciated with cirrhosis of the liver supports the lik elihood that exposure to vinyl chloride 
increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, al though relative risks for hepatocellular 
carcinoma are smaller than those associated with ang iosarcoma of the liver. Inflammatory 
and regenerative processes associated with HBV and hepatitis C viral infection and 
chronic alcoholism are considered to be an importan t pathway through which the risk for 
hepatocellular carcinoma is increased by these expo sures in the general population.]  
(d) Meta-analysis 
In meta-analysis of cohort studies of vinyl chlorid e (Boffetta et al ., 2003), duration of 
employment was available in three studies (Weber et al ., 1981; Mundt et al ., 2000; Ward 
et al .,  2001): in the two multicentric investigations (Mund t et al ., 2000; Ward et al .,  
2001), an increase in mortality from liver cancer w as evident beginning at durations of 
≥ 7 years and up to 25 years whereas, in the German study (Weber et al ., 1981), a sharp 
increase was found starting from 13–16 years of dur ation of exposure. Mortality from 
liver cancer by year of first employment was increa sed in the two multicentric studies 
(Mundt et al ., 2000; Ward et al .,  2001). [Adjustment for time since first employment 
would be advisable; the lack of adjustment could be mislead ing, as a very strong decrease 
in risk over calendar time was shown, while more re cently exposed workers had not 
completed the latency time necessary for liver canc er to be expressed.]  
2.3.2  Case–control studies  (Table 6)  
A case–control analysis of 23 liver angiosarcomas w as conducted at the plant in 
Louisville, KY (USA), and confirmed a strong and si gnificant association with exposure to 
vinyl chloride and PVC (exposure to vinyl chloride, p < 0.001; exposure to PVC, p = 0.003); 
in a case–cohort analysis that used exposure estima ted on the basis of a six-point ranking 
scale of chemicals present in the plant, cases of a ngiosarcoma had significantly greater 
exposure to vinyl chloride than the reference cohor t (Lewis & Rempala, 2003). 346 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 In the case–control study of cases of liver cancer nested in the cohort in Taiwan, China 
(Wong  et al. , 2003a), tobacco smoking, alcoholic beverage consu mption and familial 
history of chronic liver disease were not found to be associated with liver cancer, which 
may be attributed to the low prevalence of these ri sk factors in the study population. 
A history of employment in a high-exposure job was associated with an increased risk 
of 2.9 (95% CI, 1.1–7.3). A strong association was observed with HBsAg (odds ratio, 
15.7; 95% CI, 3.6–68.4) or a history of tank cleani ng (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4–9.2). 
Models were also fitted that included both HBsAg an d a history of tank cleaning, and a 
parameter for the potential interaction between the  two. Strong evidence for an interaction 
between HBsAg and a history of tank cleaning was ob served in this model; a history of 
tank cleaning and HBsAg negativity had an odds ratio of 4.0  (95% CI, 0.2–69.1), HBsAg 
positivity and no history of tank cleaning had an o dds ratio of 25.7 (95% CI, 2.9–229.4) 
and combined HBsAg positivity and a history of tank  cleaning had an odds ratio of 396 
(95 % CI, 22.6– ∞). Similar results were observed when the analysis was based on a 
history of high exposure to VCM rather than a histo ry of tank cleaning. [The Working 
Group was concerned that the method used to select controls may have biased the study. 
The age at which controls were matched to cases was  not clear. Of greater concern is that 
the controls were restricted to individuals who had  no history of chronic liver disease. 
This may have biased the study towards the null sin ce this restriction was not applied to 
the cases.]  
A cross-sectional study of hepatocellular carcinoma  in the Porto Marghera (Italy) 
cohort (Mastrangelo  et al. , 2004) found an association between exposure to VC M and 
both liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The odds ratio for cumulative exposure 
to VCM of > 2500 ppm × year was 29.3 (95% CI, 3.61–1298). Odds ratios ten ded to be 
higher for those subjects who were exposed to multi ple risk factors. For example, the 
odds ratio for exposure to > 2500 ppm × year and consumption of > 60 g per day of 
alcohol was 409 (95% CI, 19.6–8553). These analyses  controlled for age and hepatitis 
viral infection. Similar patterns were seen in anal yses of the relationship between expo-
sure to VCM and HBV/hepatitis C viral infection tha t controlled for alcoholic beverage 
consumption. [The Working Group noted that the methodology  used to select controls for 
this analysis, which excluded individuals who had l iver cirrhosis, may have resulted in a 
positive bias in the relative risk estimates.]

 significantly increased with time since first exposure of  ≥ 35 years (hazard ratio, 2.6; 
95% CI, 1.2–5.9). The highest SMR was found for those first exposed bef ore 1950 
(SMR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.97–2.88). Mortality from brain cancer was also in excess 
among subjects who had worked in plants that began production before 1946  (22 
deaths; SMR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11–2.68). 
(b) European multicentric study 
An update of the European multicentric study found an overall SMR for brain cancer 
of 0.93 (24 observed deaths; 95% CI, 0.60–1.39); th e SIR was 0.91 based on 19 cases 
(Ward et al ., 2000, 2001). No trends in the SMRs were observed  with respect to time 
since first employment, duration of employment, cum ulative exposure or calendar period 
of hire. The risk for brain cancer among those who had ever been autoclave workers was 
similar to that of those who had never been autocla ve workers. Poisson regression 
analyses of deaths from brain cancer found no signi ficant trends with latency, duration of 
employment or cumulative exposure to vinyl chloride , although the rate ratio was ele-
vated in the middle-dose category of cumulative dos e (relative risk, 3.45; 95% CI, 0.94–
12.6).  
In the incidence analyses, significant excesses wer e found for the category of 27–35 
years since first employment (eight observed deaths ; SMR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.15–5.27) and 
in the highest category of duration of employment ( six observed deaths; SMR, 2.15; 95% 
CI, 0.79–4.68), but no apparent trend with cumulati ve exposure was observed (data not 
shown).  
(c) Other studies 
An SMR of 1.62 (based on two deaths) was reported i n the historical cohort study of 
VCM/PVC production workers in Germany (Weber et al ., 1981). The SMRs by duration 
of exposure of < 12 months, 13–16 months, 61–120 mo nths and > 121 months were 0, 0, 
3.50 (one death) and 2.78 (one death), respectively . 
An SMR of 1.54 (four observed deaths) was reported in a Russian cohort of more 
than 3200 VCM/PVC production workers (Smulevich et al. , 1988). The SMR was 0.9 for 
men and 5 for women. 
An SMR of 2.86 for brain cancer (based on two death s) was reported in a cohort in 
Taiwan, China (Wong, O. et al ., 2002). 
(d) Meta-analysis 
In the meta-analysis by Boffetta et al . (2003), the meta-SMR for brain cancer 
calculated from five studies was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.98 –1.62). The authors noted that the 
increase in the meta-SMR was mainly due to the Nort h American multicentric study 
(Mundt et al. , 2000) and that no trend with duration of exposure  was found in either of the 
two large studies (Mundt et al. , 2000; Ward et al. , 2000).  VINYL CHLORIDE 355  
 
 2.4.2  Case–control and case–cohort studies  
A case–cohort and matched case–control analysis of brain cancer was conducted at a 
polymer production plant included in the North Amer ican multicentric cohort (Lewis & 
Rempala, 2003) in which 15 of 36 deaths from brain can cer were identified. The SMR for 
brain cancer was 2.29 (95% CI, 1.29–3.81) at this f acility and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.69–1.71) at 
all other plants combined (Lewis et al ., 2003). Sixteen deaths from brain cancer from 
1963 to 2000 were included in the case–cohort and c ase–control studies. The cases of 
brain cancer were slightly less likely than other c ohort members to have worked in any 
PVC building (18.8% versus 26.5%, respectively), an d slightly more likely to have 
worked in the building that manufactured nitrile ru bber copolymers (31.3% versus 25.9%, 
respectively). In general, estimates of cumulative exposure to materials used in PVC pro-
duction among cases of brain cancer were lower than  those for other cohort members, 
while exposures to chemicals used in nitrile rubber  production were similar. In the 
matched case–control analysis, no significant assoc iations were observed between status 
of brain cancer case and any of the materials used in either PVC or nitrile rubber co-
polymer production.  
2.5 Cancer of the lung and respiratory tract  
2.5.1  Lung cancer 
(a) Cohort studies (Table 8)  
(i) North American multicentric study  
In an update of the North American multicentric study (Mundt et al ., 2000), there was 
no evidence of any association between employment w ith exposure to vinyl chloride and 
mortality from lung cancer overall (303 deaths; SMR , 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.92), nor was 
there any pattern of association by year of first e xposure or year at which production of 
vinyl chloride began. The authors noted that regional mort ality rates for lung cancer, used 
as the primary referent rates in the analysis, were  higher than those in the USA as a 
whole. The SMR for lung cancer based on national re ferent rates was 0.96 (95% CI, 
0.86–2.07).  
(ii) European multicentric study  
An update of the European multicentric study found an overall SMR for lung cancer 
of 0.95 (272 cases; 95% CI, 0.84–1.07) and an SIR o f 0.80 (154 deaths; 95% CI, 0.68–
0.94). No association was observed between mortalit y from lung cancer and exposure to 
vinyl chloride, as estimated by ranked level of exp osure, latency, duration of employment, 
cumulative exposure to vinyl chloride and ever/never  employment as an autoclave worker 
(Ward et al ., 2000, 2001). Non-significant associations were f ound for time since first 
employment, production or processing and duration o f employment. In Poisson regression  356 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 analyses, non-significant negative trends were obse rved with increasing cumulative 
exposure. 
A possible association between exposure to PVC dust  and lung cancer was suggested 
by several early studies as well as recent investig ations of PVC baggers in a VCM/PVC 
manufacturing plant in Italy (Pirastu et al ., 1998; Mastrangelo et al ., 2003). Therefore, 
packers and baggers were examined separately in the Europea n multicentric cohort study. 
No trend in risk was observed with increasing cumulative exposure for thos e who had 
ever been employed as packers and baggers, among wh om 53 deaths from lung cancer 
occurred (Ward et al ., 2000). However, among individuals who only worke d as packers 
and baggers, 30 deaths from lung cancer occurred, a nd the trend with increasing cumu-
lative exposure was statistically significant. 
In the cohort of 1658 vinyl chloride workers in Por to Marghera (Pirastu et al ., 2003), 
an SMR for lung cancer of 1.73 (seven deaths; 90% C I, 0.93–3.21) was observed among 
‘only baggers’; the SMR for ‘only baggers’ versus ‘ never baggers’ adjusted for latency 
was 2.31 (90% CI, 1.15–4.61; p = 0.047).  
(iii) Other studies  
In a Canadian cohort, an SMR of 0.34 (95% CI, 0.04– 1.25) was reported for cancer of 
the lung, trachea or bronchus (Thériault & Allard, 1981).   
A study in the former Soviet Union (Smulevich et al. , 1988) showed an SMR of 1.39 
(17 observed deaths; 95% CI, 0.81–2.23) for lung ca ncer and a cohort study in France 
(LaPlanche et al ., 1992) reported eight observed deaths from lung c ancer but did not 
include risk estimates.  
A study in Taiwan, China, reported an SMR of 0.59 ( four observed deaths) for lung 
cancer (Wong, O. et al ., 2002).  
(iv) Meta-analysis  
The meta-analysis by Boffetta et al . (2003) showed a meta-SMR for lung cancer of 
0.90 (95% CI, 0.77–1.06) based on five studies.  
(b) Case–control studies (Table 9)   
In a nested case–control study in Porto Marghera, I taly, risk factors for lung cancer 
were examined among 38 subjects who had lung cancer  and 224 subjects with no history 
of cancer (Mastrangelo et al ., 2003). Although no association was observed betw een 
estimated cumulative exposure to VCM and lung cance r, the odds ratio for exposure to 
PVC dust among baggers with known length of exposur e was 5.60 (95% CI, 2.03–16.3). 
When stratified by duration of work as a bagger, th e odds ratio was 2.87 (95% CI, 0.84–
8.56) among those who were employed for < 3.6 years  and 7.15 (95% CI, 2.55–19.3) 
among those employed for > 3.6 years. Although the quantity of cigarettes smoked per 
day was associated with lung cancer, this did not a ppear to confound the association 
between lung cancer and work as a bagger. 362 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 In a case–control study from seven European countri es (Scélo et al. , 2004) that included 
2861 cases of lung cancer and 3118 hospital control s, the odds ratio for ever exposure to 
vinyl chloride was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.68–1.62). A mode st non-significant increase in the 
risk for lung cancer was found in the highest-expos ed subgroup. 
2.5.2  Other cancers of the respiratory tract 
With respect to other cancers of the respiratory tr act, neither the European nor the 
North American multicentric cohort studies found an y evidence of an excess incidence of 
or mortality from laryngeal cancer. Mortality from cancer of the pleura was moderately 
elevated in the update of the European multicentric  cohort (nine deaths; SMR, 1.89; 95% 
CI, 0.86–3.59) (Ward et al. , 2000, 2001). In an update of the North American mul ticentric 
study (Mundt et al. , 2000), an elevated SMR was found for cancer of ot her parts of the 
respiratory tract (six deaths; SMR, 1.80; 95% CI, 0 .66–3.92). 
2.6 Cancer of the lymphatic and haematopoeitic tissues (Table 10)  
2.6.1  North American multicentric study 
In the update of the North American multicentric st udy, the SMR for cancer of the 
lymphatic and haematopoeitic tissues was 0.86 (71 o bserved deaths; 95% CI, 0.67–1.08). 
The SMR for lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma (defined as ICD-9 code 200) was 1.20 
(12 deaths; 95% CI, 0.62–2.09). No excesses were re ported for other leukaemias or 
Hodgkin lymphoma (Mundt et al ., 2000).  
2.6.2  European multicentric study 
In an update of the European multicentric cohort st udy, an SMR of 0.94 (62 deaths; 
95% CI, 0.72–1.21) was observed for cancers of lymp hatic and haematopoeitic tissue; no 
significant excess was reported in any category of leukaemia or lymphoma. The overall 
SMR of 1.19 (26 deaths; 95% CI, 0.78–1.75) for non- Hodgkin lymphoma (Ward et al ., 
2000, 2001) was much lower than that observed in the  original study (seven deaths; SMR, 
1.70; 95% CI, 0.69–3.71) (Simonato et al ., 1991). The SIR for non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(ICD-9 code 200 and 202) in the updated study was 0.78 (20 d eaths; 95% CI, 0.48–1.21); 
SIRs reported for other leukaemias and lymphomas we re all below 1.00. Among the four 
countries, Italy had the highest SMR of 1.86 (95% CI, 0.84– 3.54) and much of the excess 
was in the mixed production plants (SMR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.96–2.27). No significant 
trends were observed with time since first employme nt, duration of employment, cumu-
lative exposure or calendar period of hire. In the Poisson regression analyses, there ap-
peared to be some elevation in rate ratios above the baselin e category of cumulative dose, 
but the trend was not statistically significant (da ta not shown). 366 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 2.6.3  Other studies 
Only one death from leukaemia (1.67 expected; SMR, 0.60) was reported in the 
Canadian study (Thériault & Allard, 1981). 
Two independent European studies in Germany (Weber et al ., 1981) and the former 
Soviet Union (Smulevich et al ., 1988) have reported significantly increased mortality 
from neoplasms of the lymphatic and haematopoeitic system ( Germany: SMR, 2.14; 95% 
CI, 1.12–3.53; former Soviet Union: SMR, 4; p < 0.05.  
A study in Taiwan, China, reported a significant SMR  for neoplasms of the lymphatic 
and haematopoeitic system (seven deaths; SMR, 2.71;  95% CI, 1.09–5.60) (Wong, O. et 
al ., 2002). 
2.6.4  Meta-analysis 
The meta-analysis by Boffetta et al . (2003) showed a meta-SMR for neoplasms of the 
lymphatic and haematopoeitic system of 0.90 (95% CI , 0.75–1.07) based on the two 
multicentric cohorts. A meta-SMR for all studies wa s not calculated due to the high 
degree of heterogeneity between studies. 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma (ICD-9 20 0, 202, 203) were 
combined in the meta-analysis (Boffetta et al ., 2003). SMRs for both the European and 
North American multicentric cohorts were below 1.00 . However, an independent study 
from the former Soviet Union reported a significant ly elevated SMR of 4.17 ( p < 0.05) for 
this category of neoplasms (Smulevich et al ., 1988). Due to borderline results for tests of 
heterogeneity, the multicentric cohorts and three i ndependent studies were combined in 
the meta-analysis to yield a meta-SMR of 1.23 (95% CI, 0.70–2.19). 
2.7 Malignant melanoma and cancer of the skin (Table 11)  
2.7.1  North American multicentric cohort study 
In the update of the North American cohort (Mundt et al ., 2000), no elevation in mortality 
from skin cancer was observed (12 observed deaths; SMR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.33–1.12). 
2.7.2  European multicentric cohort study 
An update of the European multicentric study found a non-significantly elevated 
SMR for malignant melanoma (15 deaths; SMR, 1.60; 9 5% CI, 0.90–2.65) (Ward et al ., 
2000, 2001). The analysis of incidence did not show an excess of melanoma (18 observed 
cases; SIR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.63–1.68). An excess of mortality from melanoma had been 
previously noted for the Norwegian cohort and was f ound to be dose-related (Heldaas et 
al ., 1984, 1987; Lang ărd et al ., 2000). In the update of the European multicentri c study, 
the excess in Norway was statistically significant (five  deaths; SMR, 6.27; 95% CI, 2.04–
14.6) (Ward et al ., 2001). An excess of mortality from melanoma was also observed in  370 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

observed with previous employment as an autoclave c leaner. 
2.7.3  Other cohort studies 
In a study in the former Soviet Union (Smulevich et al. , 1988), one case of melanoma 
skin cancer was reported (SMR, 2.00; p > 0.05). 
No cases were reported from the other independent studies ( Thériault & Allard, 1981; 
Weber et al. , 1981; Laplanche et al. , 1992; Wong, O. et al. , 2002). 
2.7.4  Meta-analysis 
 In the meta-analysis, results for mortality from s kin cancer were heterogeneous, 
with no overall indication of an increased risk (me ta-SMR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.49–2.54) 
(Boffetta et al ., 2003).  
2.8 Cancer of the breast  
 Although concern has been raised about a potential  association between exposure 
to vinyl chloride and the risk for breast cancer, h uman studies to date are not informative 
on this issue because of the very small numbers of women incl uded. The analyses of both 
the European and North American cohorts included on ly men because of the extremely 
small number of women available for analysis (59 in  the European multicentric cohort 
and 11 in the North American cohort) (Mundt et al. , 2000; Ward et al. , 2000, 2001). No 
deaths from breast cancer were observed in the Euro pean multicentric cohort (Ward et al. , 
2000), with only 0.53 expected, and two deaths were  observed in the North American 
cohort, with 1.05 expected (SMR, 1.90; 95% CI, 0.23 –6.87) (Mundt et al. , 2000). 
2.9 Soft-tissue sarcoma 
2.9.1  North American multicentric cohort study 
In the update of the North American multicentric stu dy (Mundt et al. , 2000), the SMR 
for cancer of connective and soft tissue was 2.70 ( 12 deaths; 95% CI, 1.39–4.72); 
significant excesses were observed for those employ ed for 10–19 years (SMR, 4.77; 95% 
CI, 1.55–11.1) and for those employed for 20 years or more (SMR, 7.25; 95% CI, 1.97–
18.6). SMRs were also significantly increased for f irst exposure before 1950 (SMR, 3.33; 
CI, 1.08–7.77) and between 1950 and 1959 (SMR, 4.68 ; 95% CI, 1.88–9.64). Seven of 
the 12 cancers were specific soft tissue other than  angiosarcomas, and four were angio-
sarcomas with site not specified.   VINYL CHLORIDE 373  
 
 2.9.2  European multicentric cohort study 
A total of six soft-tissue sarcomas were observed i n the European multicentric study 
(SMR, 1.89; 95% CI, 0.69–4.11) (Ward et al ., 2000, 2001), all of which occurred in the 
United Kingdom. Three additional soft-tissue sarcom as were identified from the inci-
dence data (one in the United Kingdom and two in Sw eden). However, during the review 
of the best available data for diagnosis to ascerta in cases of liver cancer, it became appar-
ent that three of the six deaths coded as tumours o f the connective tissue were actually 
angiosarcomas of the liver, the primary site of whi ch had been miscoded. A Poisson re-
gression analysis was not conducted for the remaini ng soft-tissue sarcomas due to the 
small number of cases involved. 
2.9.3  Other cohort studies 
Two deaths from soft-tissue sarcoma were observed i n the Canadian cohort (SMR, 
5.26) (Thériault & Allard, 1981). 
One case of soft-tissue sarcoma was observed in the  cohort from the former Soviet 
Union (SMR, 1.43; p > 0.05) (Smulevich et al. , 1988) 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
Studies of the carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride foll owing oral, inhalation and/or intra-
tracheal administration, subcutaneous and/or intram uscular administration, intraperitoneal 
administration and perinatal exposure have been rev iewed previously (IARC, 1979, 
1987). Those that were found to be adequate and/or reported more fully in later publi-
cations are included in this section.  
The carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride has been stud ied intensively and repeatedly by 
inhalation exposure of experimental animals at a ra nge of concentrations that spanned 
decimal orders of magnitude. The numerous studies w ere generally mutually reinforced 
and consistently yielded hepatic and extrahepatic a ngiosarcomas in mice, rats and ham-
sters. Various other malignant neoplasms also occur red at several anatomical sites. 
However, the reporting of this multitude of data ha s often been incomplete, and the 
outcomes of many studies are available only from su mmary tables in the published 
literature, in which technical details are given on ly as footnotes. 
3.1 Inhalation exposure 
3.1.1  Mouse 
Groups of 12 male and 12 female NMRI mice, 12 weeks  of age, were exposed by 
inhalation to 50 or 500 ppm [130 or 1300 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride [purity unspecified] on 374 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 6 h per day for 5 days per week for either 26 (500 ppm) or 52 (50 ppm) weeks. Two 
groups of 12 male and 12 female control mice were u ntreated and were observed for 
either 26 or 52 weeks. The treatment with 500 ppm vin yl chloride was terminated at week 
26 because of poor survival. The incidence of treat ment-related tumours in males of the 
two control groups combined, and low- and high-dose  groups, respectively, was: extra-
hepatic angiosarcomas, 0/24, 6/12 and 3/12; and lung  tumours, 0/24, 9/12 and 12/12. That 
in females was: extrahepatic angiosarcomas, 0/24, 8/12 and  5/12; and lung tumours, 0/24, 
4/12 and 12/12. Mammary carcinomas were observed in  1/24, 1/12 and 4/12 control, low-
dose and high-dose females, respectively [no statis tical analysis reported] (Holmberg 
et al ., 1976). 
Groups of 36 male and 36 female CD-1 mice, 2 months  of age, were exposed by 
inhalation to 0, 50, 250 or 1000 ppm [0, 130, 650 o r 2600 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride (99.8% 
pure) in air for 6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 52 weeks. Four animals per group were 
terminated at 1, 2, 3, 6 or 9 months for laboratory  tests and gross and histological exam-
ination. The incidence of liver angiosarcomas in co ntrol, 50-, 250- and 1000-ppm vinyl 
chloride-treated mice, respectively, was 0/26, 3/29, 7/29 ( p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test) and 
13/33 ( p < 0.05) males and 0/36, 0/34, 16/34 ( p < 0.05) and 18/36 [ p < 0.05] females; that 
of extrahepatic angiosarcomas was 0/26, 5/29 ( p < 0.05), 2/29 and 0/33 males and 0/36, 
1/34, 3/34 and 9/36 ( p < 0.05) females, respectively; and that of lung tu mours (adenomas) 
was 1/26, 8/29, 10/29 and 22/33 males and 0/36, 4/3 4, 12/34 and 26/36 females, respec-
tively. The incidence of mammary tumours (adenocarc inomas and carcinomas) in female 
mice was 0/36, 9/34, 3/34 and 13/36, respectively [no stati stical analysis reported for lung 
and mammary tumours] (Lee et al. , 1978). 
Groups of 8–28 male and 8–28 female CD1 mice, 2 mon ths of age, were exposed by 
whole-body inhalation to 0, 130, 650 or 2600 mg/m 3 [0, 340, 1690 or 6760 ppm] vinyl 
chloride (99.8% pure) for 6 h per day on 5 days per  week  for 1, 3 or 6 months and were 
then removed from exposure chambers and observed fo r an additional 12 months. The 
incidence of haemangiosarcoma and lung and mammary gland tumours is presented in 
Table 12. An increased cumulative incidence of haem angiosarcomas and bronchiolo-
alveolar lung tumours was seen in male and female m ice and an increase in the cumu-
lative incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas/carc inomas in females (Hong et al. , 
1981). 
Groups of 30 male and 30 female Swiss mice [data re ported for both sexes 
combined], 11 weeks of age, were exposed by inhalat ion to 50, 250, 500, 2500, 6000 or 
10 000 ppm [130, 650, 1300, 6500, 15 600 or 26 000 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride (99.97% 
pure) on 4 h per day on 5 days per week for 30 week s. Control animals comprised 150 
untreated mice [sex distribution not specified; dat a reported for both sexes combined]. 
Animals were observed until 81 weeks, when the expe riment (experiment BT4) was 
terminated. Survival rates of the groups were not r eported. The incidence of treatment-
related tumours in control and 50-, 250-, 500-, 250 0-, 6000- and 10 000-ppm vinyl 
chloride-treated mice, respectively, was: liver ang iosarcomas, 0/150, 1/60, 18/60, 14/60, 
16/59, 13/60 and 10/56; extrahepatic angiosarcomas, 1/150 , 1/60, 3/60, 7/60, 8/59, 1/60   VINYL CHLORIDE 375

mammary carcinomas, 1/150, 12/60, 12/60, 8/60, 8/59 , 8/60 and 13/56. A low incidence 
of skin tumours was also reported [no statistical a nalysis provided] (Maltoni et al. , 1981).  
Groups of female Swiss CD-1 mice [initial numbers not specif ied], 8–9 weeks of age, 
were exposed by whole-body inhalation to 0 (control) or 130 mg/m 3 [0 or 50 ppm] vinyl 
chloride (commercial grade) [purity unspecified] for 6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 6, 
12 or 18 months. Animals were allowed to complete t heir lifespan and were necropsied 
when moribund or dead. There was a significant decr ease ( p < 0.01) in survival of the 
animals treated for 6, 12 and 18 months compared wi th controls. Statistically significant 
increases ( p < 0.01, life-table analysis) in the incidence of h aemangiosarcomas (all sites, 
mainly peritoneal and skin), mammary gland carcinom as and lung carcinomas were 
observed in all exposure groups. The incidence of h aemangiosarcomas (all sites) was: 
control, 1/71; exposed for 6 months, 29/67; 12 months, 30/ 47; and 18 months, 20/45. The 
incidence of mammary gland carcinomas was 2/71, 33/ 67, 22/47 and 22/45, respectively; 
and that of lung carcinomas was 9/71, 18/65, 15/47 and 11/45, respectively. In the same  VINYL CHLORIDE 377  
 
 study, groups of female Swiss CD-1 mice [initial nu mbers not specified], 8 or 14 months 
of age, were exposed by whole-body inhalation to 0 ( control) or 130 mg/m 3 [0 or 50 ppm] 
vinyl chloride for 6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 6 or 12 months. Animals were 
allowed to complete their lifespan and were necrops ied when found moribund or dead. 
Among animals exposed for 6 months beginning at 8 a nd 14 months of age, statistically 
significant increases (life-table analysis) in the incidence of haemangiosarcomas (all sites) 
(control, 1/71; 8 months of age, 11/49, p < 0.01; and 14 months of age, 5/53), mammary 
gland carcinomas (control, 2/71; 8 months of age, 1 3/49, p < 0.01; and 14 months of age, 
2/53) and lung carcinomas (control, 9/71; 8 months of age, 13/49, p < 0.05; and 14 
months of age, 7/53) were observed in the animals e xposed beginning at 8 months of age 
only. Among those exposed for 12 months, statistica lly significant increases in the 
incidence of haemangiosarcomas (all sites) (control , 1/71; 8 months of age, 17/46, 
p < 0.01; and 14 months of age, 3/50), mammary gland  carcinomas (control, 2/71; 
8 months of age, 8/45, p < 0.01; and 14 months of age, 0/50) and lung carci nomas 
(control, 9/71; 8 months of age, 9/46, p < 0.05; and 14 months of age, 3/50) were 
observed in the animals exposed beginning at 8 mont hs of age only (Drew et al. , 1983). 
Groups of female B6C3F 1 mice [initial number not specified], 8–9 weeks of age, 
were exposed by whole-body inhalation to 0 (control ) or 130 mg/m 3 [0 or 5.0 ppm] vinyl 
chloride (commercial grade) [purity unspecified] for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for 6 
or 12 months. Animals were allowed to complete thei r lifespan and were necropsied 
when found moribund or dead. There was a significan t decrease ( p < 0.01) in survival of 
the animals treated for 6 or 12 months compared wit h controls. Statistically significant 
increases ( p < 0.01, life-table analysis) in the incidence of h aemangiosarcomas (all sites) 
and mammary gland tumours were observed in all expo sure groups. The incidence of 
haemangiosarcomas (all sites, mainly peritoneal and s ubcutis) was: control, 4/69; exposed 
for 6 months, 46/67; and 12 months, 69/90; that of mammary gland carcinomas was 3/69 
(control), 29/67 and 37/90, respectively. In the sa me study, groups of female B6C3F 1 
mice [initial number not specified], 8 or 14 months  of age, were exposed by whole-body 
inhalation to 0 (control) or 130 mg/m 3 [0 or 50 ppm] vinyl chloride for 6 h per day on 5 
days per week for 6 or 12 months. Animals were allo wed complete their lifespan and 
were necropsied when found moribund or dead. There was a significant decrease 
(p < 0.01) in survival of the treated animals compare d with controls. Among the animals 
exposed for 6 and 12 months, statistically signific ant increases ( p < 0.01 except p < 0.05 
where indicated, life-table analysis) were observed  in the incidence of haemangio-
sarcomas (all sites) (control, 4/69; 6-month exposu res: 8 months of age, 27/42; and 14 
months of age, 30/51; 12-month exposures: 8 months of age, 30/48; and 14 months of 
age, 29/48) and mammary gland carcinomas (control, 3/69 ; 6-month exposures: 8 months 
of age, 13/42; and 14 months of age, 4/51, p < 0.05; 12-month exposures: 8 months of 
age, 9/48; and 14 months of age, 4/48) (Drew et al ., 1983). 
[The Working Group noted that lung tumours were not  observed in B6C3F 1 mice 
exposed to vinyl chloride in the studies of Drew et al . (1983), whereas Swiss CD-1 mice, 378 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 a strain that is more susceptible to the induction of lung tumours, did develop such 
tumours in these and other studies.] 
Groups of 30, 40 or 60 male CD1 mice, 5–6 weeks of age, were exposed by whole-
body inhalation to 0, 2.6, 26, 260, 780 or 1560 mg/ m 3 [0, 1, 10, 100, 300 or 600 ppm] 
vinyl chloride [purity unspecified] for 6 h per day  on 5 days per week  for 4 weeks and 
were then observed for an additional 0, 12 or 40–41 w eeks. Surviving animals were killed 
after each observation period. The study focused on  lung tumours. After 12 weeks of 
exposure, the incidence of pulmonary tumours was 0/ 18, 0/10, 0/9, 0/6, 6/9 and 8/9 for 
mice treated with 0 (control), 2.6, 26, 260, 780 and 1560 mg/ m 3, respectively; after 40–41 
weeks of exposure, the incidence was 0/17, 1/9, 3/9 , 6/9, 5/7 and 6/7, respectively [no 
statistical analysis provided] (Suzuki, 1983). 
3.1.2  Rat 
Groups of 36 male and 36 female CD rats, 2 months o f age, were exposed by 
inhalation to 0, 50, 250 or 1000 ppm [0, 130, 650 o r 2600 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride (99.8% 
pure) in air for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for 52 weeks. Four animals per group were 
terminated at 1, 2, 3, 6 or 9 months for laboratory  tests and gross and histological exam-
ination. The combined incidence of liver angiosarco mas by increasing level of exposure 
was 0/35 (control), 0/36, 2/36 and 6/34 in males and 0/35 (c ontrol), 0/36, 10/34 ( p < 0.05, 
Fisher’s exact test) and 15/36 ( p < 0.05) in females, respectively. Similarly, the i ncidence 
of extrahepatic angiosarcomas was 0/35 (control), 1 /36, 2/36 and 4/34 in males and 0/35 
(control), 1/36, 3/34 and 10/36 ( p < 0.05) in females, respectively (Lee et al. , 1978). 
Groups of 62 newly weaned male and female Wistar ra ts were exposed by whole-
body inhalation to 0 or 13 000 mg/m 3 [0 or 5000 ppm] vinyl chloride ( ≥ 99.97% pure) for 
7 h per day on 5 days per week  for 52 weeks. Ten animals per dose per sex were kil led at 
4, 13, 26 and 52 weeks. No information on survival was provided. At 52 weeks, an in-
crease in the incidence of angiosarcomas of the liv er (males, 3/9; females, 6/10), Zymbal 
gland squamous-cell carcinomas (males, 3/9; females , 2/10) and carcinomas of the nasal 
cavity (males, 2/9; females, 5/10) compared with co ntrols (no tumours) was observed [no 
statistical evaluation provided] (Feron & Kroes, 19 79; Feron et al. , 1979). 
Groups of 110–128 male and 110–128 female Sprague-D awley rats, 6, 18, 32 or 52 
weeks of age, were exposed in chambers by whole-bod y inhalation to 0 (controls) or 
2465 mg/m 3 [0 or 940 ppm] vinyl chloride [purity unspecified]  for 7 h per day on 5 days 
per week  for 24.5 weeks. An epidemic of pneumonia in exposed  rats during the 28th week 
forced premature conclusion of the study and all surviving r ats were killed 43 weeks after 
the beginning of exposure. Rats killed at 3, 6 or 9  months (interim sacrifice group) were 
evaluated separately from rats that either died, we re killed in poor condition or were killed 
at the conclusion of the study (non-scheduled sacri fice group). Angiosarcomas, mostly 
primary tumours in the liver, were highly anaplasti c and frequently metastasized to the 
lung. The incidence of angiosarcomas in vinyl chlor ide-exposed male rats in the non-
scheduled sacrifice group was 0/37, 0/44, 3/45 and 13/55 in rats that were exposed  VINYL CHLORIDE 379  
 
 beginning at 6, 18, 32 or 52 weeks of age, respecti vely. The corresponding incidence of 
angiosarcomas in exposed females was 2/38, 7/47, 23 /49 and 11/54. Only one angio-
sarcoma occurred in subcutaneous tissues in a contr ol male placed on study at 32 weeks 
of age (incidence for this control group, 1/86; inc idence for all control males, 1/357). The 
incidence of angiosarcomas in control females was 0 /382. Pituitary tumours and mam-
mary tumours occurred in both control and exposed r ats at comparable rates. A few rats in 
the control and exposed groups had Zymbal gland or brain tumours (Groth et al. , 1981).  
Five groups of 51–93 male random-bred white rats, w eighing 160–180 g at the 
beginning of the experiment, were exposed by whole- body inhalation to 0 (control), 14, 
25, 266 or 3690 mg/m 3 [0, 5.4, 9.6, 102 or 1420 ppm] vinyl chloride [pur ity unspecified] 
for 4.5 h per day on 5 days per week  for 52 weeks and observed until their death, but no  
longer than 126 weeks. The authors reported the dev elopment of angiosarcomas of liver 
or other sites in rats of the three highest-dose gr oups (9.3–15.7%). No such tumours were 
observed in control animals (Kurlyandski et al. , 1981).  
Groups of 30 male and 30 female Sprague-Dawley rats  [data reported for both sexes 
combined], 12 weeks of age, were exposed by inhalat ion to 50, 250, 500, 2500, 6000 or 
10 000 ppm [130, 650, 1300, 6500, 15 600 or 26 000 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride (99.97% 
pure) for 4 h per day on 5 days per week for 17 wee ks. Control animals comprised 190 
untreated rats [data reported for both sexes combin ed]. Animals were observed until 156 
weeks, when the experiment (experiment BT3) was ter minated. Survival rates of the 
groups were not reported. The incidence of tumours was: liver angiosarcomas, 0/190, 
0/58, 0/59, 1/60, 1/60, 1/60 and 0/58 in control, 50-, 250-, 5 00-, 2500-, 6000- and 10 000-
ppm vinyl chloride-treated rats, respectively; ‘hep atomas’, 0/190 (control), 0/58, 0/59, 
0/60, 2/60, 1/60 and 1/58, respectively; Zymbal gla nd carcinomas, 2/190 (control), 0/58, 
1/59, 1/60, 7/60, 9/60 and 9/58, respectively; and ‘skin epitheliomas’, 1/190 (control), 
1/58, 0/59, 0/60, 2/60, 5/60 and 5/58, respectively  [no statistical analysis reported] 
(Maltoni et al ., 1981). 
Groups of 60 male and 60 female Sprague-Dawley rats  [data reported for both sexes 
combined], 13 weeks of age, were exposed by inhalat ion to 6000 or 10 000 ppm [15 600 
or 26 000 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride (99.97% pure) for 4 h per day on 5  days per week for 
5 weeks (groups I and II), for 1 h per day on 4 days per week for 25 weeks (groups III and 
IV) or for 4 h per day once a week for 25 weeks (gr oups V and VI). Control animals 
comprised two groups of 120 untreated rats [data re ported for both sexes combined]. 
Animals were observed until 154 weeks, when the exp eriment (experiment BT10) was 
terminated. Survival rates of the groups were not reported . The incidence of tumours was: 
liver angiosarcomas, 0/227, 1/118, 0/120, 1/119, 3/ 118, 1/119 and 1/120 in controls and 
groups I, II, III, IV, V and VI, respectively; extr ahepatic angiosarcomas, 0/227 (control), 
0/118, 0/120, 0/119, 2/118, 0/119 and 1/120, respec tively; Zymbal gland carcinomas, 
0/227 (control), 9/118, 9/120, 9/119, 5/118, 8/119 and 9/120, respectively; and mammary 
tumours, 17/227 (control), 13/118, 13/120, 16/119, 11/118, 20/119 and 12/120, 
respectively. The predominant carcinogenic effect w as in the Zymbal gland [no statistical 
analysis reported] (Maltoni et al ., 1981). 380 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 Five experiments (BT1, BT2, BT6, BT9, BT15) perform ed by Maltoni et al . (1981) 
were combined to construct a dose–response table. G roups of 60–300 male and female 
Sprague-Dawley rats [data reported for both sexes c ombined], 13–17 weeks of age, were 
exposed by inhalation to 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150 , 200, 250, 500, 2500, 6000, 10 000 or 
30 000 ppm [2.6, 13, 26, 65, 130, 260, 390, 520, 65 0, 1300, 6500, 15 600, 26 000 or 
78 000 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride (99.97% pure) for 4 h per day on 5  days per week for 52 
weeks. Controls comprised 461 untreated rats from f our experiments [data reported for 
both sexes combined]. Animals were observed until 6 8 (BT6) or 135–147 (BT1, BT2, 
BT9, BT15) weeks, when the experiments were termina ted. Survival rates of the groups 
were not reported. Selected tumour incidences are p resented in Table 13 [no statistical 
analysis reported] (Maltoni et al ., 1981). [The Working Group noted that the cleares t 
dose–response was observed for hepatic angiosarcoma s and Zymbal gland carcinomas.] 
Groups of 30–40 male (BT7) or 120–130 male [exact n umbers not specified] (BT17) 
Wistar rats, 11–13 weeks of age, were exposed by in halation to 1, 50, 250, 500, 2500, 
6000 or 10 000 ppm [2.6, 130, 650, 1300, 6500, 15 6 00 or 26 000 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride 
(99.97% pure) for 4 h per day on 5 days per week fo r 52 weeks. Control animals 
comprised 40 (BT7) or 120–130 [exact number not spe cified] (BT17) untreated rats. 
Animals were observed until 134 (BT17) or 165 (BT7)  weeks, when the experiment was 
terminated. Survival rates of the groups were not r eported. The incidence of selected 
tumours in order of increasing doses was: liver ang iosarcomas, 0/132 (control), 0/99, 
0/28, 1/27, 3/28, 3/25, 3/26 and 8/27, respectively ; extrahepatic angiosarcomas, 1/132 
(control), 3/99, 0/28, 1/27, 0/28, 1/25, 1/26 and 0 /27, respectively; ‘hepatomas’, 0/132 
(control), 1/99, 0/28, 0/27, 0/28, 1/25, 2/26 and 0 /27, respectively; and Zymbal gland 
carcinomas, 3/132 (control), 2/99, 0/28, 0/27, 0/28 , 0/25, 2/26 and 2/27, respectively [no 
statistical analysis provided] (Maltoni et al ., 1981). [The Working Group noted the lack of 
a dose–response for extrahepatic angiosarcomas, Zym bal gland carcinomas and 
hepatomas.] 
Groups of 55–112 female Fischer 344 rats, 8–9 weeks  of age, were exposed by 
whole-body inhalation to 0 (control) or 260 mg/m 3 [0 or 100 ppm] vinyl chloride 
(commercial grade) [purity unspecified] for 6 h per  day on 5 days per week  for 6, 12, 18 
or 24 months. Animals were allowed to complete thei r lifespan and were necropsied 
when found moribund or dead. There was a significan t decrease ( p < 0.01) in survival of 
animals exposed for 1 year or more compared with co ntrols. Statistically significant 
increases ( p < 0.01, life-table analysis) were observed in the incidence of liver haeman-
giosarcomas, haemangiosarcomas (all sites), mammary  gland fibroadenomas and liver 
neoplastic nodules [hepatocellular adenomas] in all  exposure groups and of mammary 
gland adenocarcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas  in the groups exposed for 12, 18 
and 24 months. Tumour incidence after 24 months of exposure was: haemangiosarcoma 
of the liver, 1/112 control versus 19/55 exposed; h aemangiosarcoma (all sites), 2/112 
control versus 24/55 exposed; fibroadenoma of the m ammary gland, 24/112 control 
versus 26/55 exposed; adenocarcinoma of mammary gla nd, 5/112 control versus 5/55 
exposed; liver neoplastic nodules [hepatocellular adenomas], 4/11 2 control versus 6/55   VINYL CHLORIDE 381

for 6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 6 or 12 months. Exposures were initiated when the 
animals were 2, 8, 14 or 20 months of age for the 6 -month exposures and 2, 8 or 14 months 
of age for the 12-month exposures. Animals were all owed to complete their lifespan and 
were necropsied when found moribund or dead. The in cidence of haemangiosarcomas, 
and mammary gland and liver tumours is presented in  Table 14. For the 6-month 
exposures, increases were observed in the incidence  of liver haemangiosarcomas in one 
exposure group, of mammary gland fibroadenomas and neoplastic liver nodules 
[hepatocellular adenomas] in the 2- and 8-month-old  groups, respectively, and of hepato-
cellular carcinomas in the 8-month-old group. After  the 12-month exposures, increases 
were observed in the incidence of liver haemangiosa rcomas, haemangiosarcomas (all 
sites) and mammary gland fibroadenomas in the 2- an d 8-month-old groups and of 
mammary gland adenocarcinomas, neoplastic liver nod ules [hepatocellular adenomas] 
and hepatocellular carcinomas in the 2-month-old gr oup (Drew et al. , 1983).

3.1.3  Hamster 
Groups of 30 male Golden hamsters, 11 weeks of age,  were exposed by inhalation to 
50, 250, 500, 2500, 6000 or 10 000 ppm [30, 650, 13 00, 6500, 15 600 or 26 000 mg/m 3] 
vinyl chloride (99.97% pure) for 4 h per day on 5 d ays per week for 30 weeks. Control 
animals comprised 60 untreated male hamsters. Anima ls were observed until 109 weeks, 
when the experiment (experiment BT8) was terminated. Surv ival rates of the groups were  VINYL CHLORIDE 383  
 
 not reported. The incidence of treatment-related tu mours by increasing dose of exposure 
was: liver angiosarcomas, 0/60 (control), 0/30, 0/3 0, 2/30, 0/30, 1/30 and 0/30, respec-
tively; skin epitheliomas, 3/60 (control), 9/30, 3/ 30, 7/30, 3/30, 1/30 and 7/30, respec-
tively; and forestomach papillomas and acanthomas, 3/60 (control), 3/30, 4/30, 9/30, 
17/30, 10/30 and 10/30, respectively. Leukaemia was  observed at a similar incidence in 
control and treated groups (8/60 (control), 6/30, 6 /30, 5/30, 9/30, 6/30 and 5/30, respec-
tively), but the authors reported a decrease in the  latency period [no statistical analysis 
provided] (Maltoni et al. , 1981). 
Groups of female Syrian golden hamsters [initial nu mbers not specified], 8–9 weeks 
of age, were exposed by whole-body inhalation to 0 or 520 mg/m 3 [0 or 200 ppm] vinyl 
chloride (commercial grade) [purity unspecified] or  6 h per day on 5 days per week  for 6, 
12 or 18 months. Animals were allowed to complete t heir lifespan and were necropsied 
when found moribund or dead. There was a significan t decrease ( p < 0.01) in survival of 
all exposed animals compared with controls. Statist ically significant increases (see Table 
15) were observed in the incidence of mammary gland  carcinomas and stomach ade-
nomas in all exposure groups and of haemangiosarcom as (all sites) in the groups exposed 
for 6 and 12 months. A significant increase in the incidence of skin carcinomas was also 
seen in the 12-month exposure group. In the same st udy, groups of female Syrian golden 
hamsters, 2, 8, 14 or 20 months of age (Groups I, I I, III and IV, respectively) [initial 
numbers not specified], were exposed by whole-body i nhalation to 0 or 520 mg/m 3 [0 or

 200 ppm] vinyl chloride for 6 h per day on 5 days p er week  for 6 or 12 months. Exposures 
were initiated when the animals were 2, 8, 14 or 20  months of age for the 6-month 
exposures and 2, 8 or 14 months of age for the 12-m onth exposures. Animals were 
allowed to complete their lifespan and were necropsied when foun d moribund or dead. 
There was a significant decrease ( p < 0.01) in the survival of animals that were expos ed 
early in life for 12 months compared with controls. In some o f the 6-month and 12-month 
exposure groups (see Table 15), statistically signi ficant increases were observed in the 
incidence of stomach adenomas, haemangiosarcomas (a ll sites) and mammary gland 
carcinomas (Drew et al. , 1983). 
[The Working Group noted the successful induction of hepatic angiosarcomas in  
three species (rats, mice and hamsters) exposed to vinyl chloride by inha lation.] 
3.2 Oral administration 
Rat 
Groups of 40 male and 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats  [data reported only for both 
sexes combined], 13 weeks of age, were administered  3.3, 17 or 50 mg/kg bw vinyl 
chloride (99.97% pure) in olive oil by gastric intu bation four or five times a week for 52 
weeks. Control rats comprised 40 males and 40 femal es [data reported for both sexes 
combined] that were treated with olive oil alone. Ani mals were observed until 136 weeks, 
when the experiment (experiment BT11) was terminate d. Survival rates of the groups 
were not reported. The incidence of treatment-relat ed tumours in control and 3.3-, 17- and 
50-mg/kg bw vinyl chloride-treated rats, respective ly, was: liver angiosarcomas, 0/80, 
0/80, 10/80 and 17/80; extrahepatic angiosarcomas, 0/80, 2/80, 0/80 and 2/80; and 
primary renal tumours (‘nephroblastomas’), 0/80, 0/ 80, 3/80 and 2/80 [no statistical 
analysis reported] (Maltoni et al. , 1981). 
Groups of 75 male and 75 female Sprague-Dawley rats  [data reported only for both 
sexes combined], 10 weeks of age, were administered  0.03, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg bw vinyl 
chloride (99.97% pure) in olive oil by gastric intubation  four or five times a week for 52–
59 weeks. Controls comprised 75 males and 75 female s [data reported for both sexes 
combined] that were treated with olive oil alone. Ani mals were observed until 136 weeks, 
when the experiment (experiment BT27) was terminate d. Survival rates of the groups 
were not reported. The incidence of several tumours  was increased in the treated groups. 
The incidence in control and 0.03-, 0.3- and 1-mg/k g bw vinyl chloride-treated rats, 
respectively, was: hepatic angiosarcomas, 0/150, 0/ 150, 1/148 and 3/149; extrahepatic 
angiosarcomas, 0/150, 0/150, 0/148 and 1/149; hepat omas [not otherwise specified], 
0/150, 0/150, 1/148 and 1/149; Zymbal gland carcino mas, 1/50, 0/150, 0/148, 5/149; and 
mammary tumours, 7/150, 14/150, 4/148 and 12/149 [n o statistical analysis reported] 
(Maltoni et al. , 1981). 
Groups of 60–80 male and 60–80 female Wistar rats, 5 weeks of age, were fed diets 
that contained 0, 1, 3 or 10% of 4000 ppm vinyl chl oride (≥ 99.97% pure) in a PVC  VINYL CHLORIDE 385  
 
 powder (vehicle) (which resulted in calculated dail y doses of 0, 1.7, 5.0 or 14 mg/kg bw 
vinyl chloride, respectively) during a 4-h feeding period each day on 7 days per week. 
Animals were treated for a total of 135 (males) or 144 (females) weeks, after which the 
experiment was terminated. Survival of males at the  end of the study was 14/60 control, 
20/60 low-dose, 0/60 intermediate-dose and 0/60 high-dose  animals; for females, survival 
was 19/60 control, 5/60 low-dose, 0/60 intermediate -dose and 0/60 high-dose animals. 
Neoplastic responses included a significantly incre ased incidence ( p < 0.05, χ2 test) of 
liver haemangiosarcomas and lung angiosarcomas in high- a nd mid-dose males and high-
dose females, of hepatocellular carcinomas in high- dose males and high- and mid-dose 
females and of neoplastic liver nodules (hepatocell ular adenomas) in high- and mid-dose 
males and females. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was 0/55 control, 1/58 
low-dose, 2/56 mid-dose and 8/59 high-dose males an d 0/57 control, 4/58 low-dose, 
19/59 mid-dose and 29/57 high-dose females; that of  liver haemangiosarcomas was 0/55 
control, 0/58 low-dose, 6/56 mid-dose and 27/59 hig h-dose males and 0/57 control, 0/58 
low-dose, 2/59 mid-dose and 9/57 high-dose females;  and that of neoplastic nodules 
(hepatocellular adenomas) was 0/55 control, 1/58 lo w-dose, 7/56 mid-dose and 23/59 
high-dose males and 2/57 control, 26/58 low-dose, 3 9/54 mid-dose and 44/57 high-dose 
females (Feron et al. , 1981). 
As in the previous experiment, groups of 50–100 male a nd 50–100 female Wistar rats 
[age unspecified] were fed diets similar to those d escribed in Feron et al.  (1981) that 
resulted in calculated daily doses of 0, 0.014, 0.1 3 and 1.3 mg/kg bw vinyl chloride 
(≥ 99.97% pure), respectively, during a daily 4–6-h f eeding period on 7 days per week. 
Animals were treated for a total of 149 (males) or 150 (females) weeks, after which the 
experiment was terminated. Survival of males at the  end of the study was 20/100 control, 
20/100 low-dose, 18/100 intermediate-dose and 8/50 high-dose animals; for females, 
survival was 24/100 control, 23/100 low-dose, 26/10 0 intermediate-dose and 5/50 
(p < 0.05) high-dose animals. Neoplastic responses in cluded a significantly increased 
incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in high-dose male s and of liver neoplastic nodules 
(hepatocellular adenomas) in high-dose females ( p < 0.05). The incidence of hepato-
cellular carcinoma was 0/99 control, 0/99 low-dose,  0/99 mid-dose and 3/49 high-dose 
males and 1/98 control, 0/100 low-dose, 1/96 mid-do se and 3/49 high-dose females; that 
of neoplastic nodules (hepatocellular adenomas) was  0/99 control, 0/99 low-dose, 0/99 
mid-dose and 1/49 high-dose males and 0/98 control,  1/100 low-dose, 1/96 mid-dose and 
9/49 high-dose females; and that of liver haemangiosarco mas was 0/99 control, 0/99 low-
dose, 0/99 mid-dose and 1/49 high-dose males and 0/ 98 control, 0/100 low-dose, 0/96 
mid-dose and 2/49 high-dose females (Til et al. , 1991).  386 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 3.3 Subcutaneous injection 
Rat 
Groups of 35 male and 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats , 21 weeks of age, were 
administered a single subcutaneous injection of 4.2 5 mg vinyl chloride (99.97% pure) in 
1 mL olive oil. Control animals comprised 35 male a nd 40 female rats that were treated 
with olive oil alone (1 mL). Animals were followed until 145 weeks, when the experi-
ment [BT13] was terminated. Survival rates of the g roups were not reported. No hepatic 
or extrahepatic angiosarcomas were observed. Tumour  incidence was reported for both 
sexes combined. Mammary tumours were observed in 1/75  vinyl chloride-treated rats and 
3/75 controls. Nephroblastomas were observed in 1/7 5 treated rats and 0/75 controls. No 
other tumour types were reported in vinyl chloride- treated animals (Maltoni et al. , 1981). 
3.4 Intraperitoneal injection 
Rat 
Groups of 30 male and 30 female Sprague-Dawley rats  [data reported for both sexes 
combined], 17 weeks of age, were administered 4.25 mg vinyl chloride (99.97% pure) in 
1 mL olive oil by intraperitoneal injection once, t wice, three times or four times at 
2-month intervals. Control animals comprised 60 rat s that were treated with olive oil 
alone (1 mL) [number of treatments not reported; data repor ted for both sexes combined]. 
Animals were followed until 144 weeks, when the exp eriment (BT12) was terminated. 
Survival rates of the groups were not reported. No liver angiosarcomas were observed. 
Extrahepatic angiosarcomas were observed in 0/55 co ntrols, and 0/55, 1/56, 1/53 and 
0/56 rats treated with vinyl chloride once, twice, three times or four times, respectively; 
mammary tumours were observed in 0/55 controls, and  2/55, 3/56, 1/53, and 1/56 rats 
treated with vinyl chloride once, twice, three time s or four times, respectively [no statis-
tical analysis reported] (Maltoni et al. , 1981). 
3.5 Transplacental administration 
Rat 
Groups of 30–54 pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats , 19 weeks of age, were 
exposed by inhalation to 6000 or 10 000 ppm [15 600  or 26 000 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride 
(99.97% pure) for 4 h per day for 7 days, from days  12 to 18 of pregnancy (experiment 
BT5). Both dams and offspring were observed until t he experiment was terminated at 143 
weeks, without further exposure to vinyl chloride [ the Working Group noted the lack of 
control groups]. Survival rates of the various grou ps were not reported. No hepatic or 
extrahepatic angiosarcomas or hepatomas were observ ed in either dams or offspring. 
Tumours appeared at several sites in offspring, inc luding extrahepatic angioma (1/32 low-
dose, 0/51 high-dose), kidney tumours (0/32 low-dos e, 3/51 high-dose), Zymbal gland  VINYL CHLORIDE 387  
 
 carcinomas (3/32 low-dose, 5/51 high-dose), skin ep itheliomas (1/32 low-dose, 0/51 high-
dose), forestomach papillomas and achanthomas (1/32  low-dose, 1/51 high-dose) and 
mammary gland tumours (2/32 low-dose, 1/51 high-dos e). No tumours occurred at these 
sites in low-dose dams. One Zymbal gland carcinoma was seen in a high-dose dam (1/30) 
(Maltoni et al. , 1981). [The Working Group considered that, despit e the lack of controls, 
this study provides some evidence of the transplace ntal carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride.] 
3.6 Perinatal exposure 
Rat 
Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (breeders), 21 weeks of age, were exposed by 
inhalation together with their newborn offspring to  6000 or 10 000 ppm [15 600 or 
26 000 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride (99.97% pure) on 4 h per day on 5 days per week for 
5 weeks. Offspring [data reported for both sexes co mbined] included 44 rats in the high-
dose and 42 in the low-dose group. All vinyl chloride-treat ed rats were followed until 124 
weeks, when the experiment (experiment BT14) was te rminated [the Working Group 
noted the lack of controls]. Survival rates of the groups were not reported. In rats treated 
perinatally, the incidence of hepatic angiosarcomas  was 17/42 and 15/44 in 6000- and 
10 000-ppm vinyl chloride-treated animals, respecti vely. Other tumours that occurred in 
low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively, were l iver angiomas (1/42, 0/44), extra-
hepatic angiosarcomas (1/42, 0/44), extrahepatic an giomas (1/42, 3/44), ‘hepatomas’ 
(20/42, 20/44), Zymbal gland carcinomas (2/42, 1/44 ), skin epitheliomas (2/42, 1/44) and 
mammary tumours (1/42, 0/44). No tumours were repor ted in breeders at the sites where 
tumours occurred in offspring (Maltoni et al. , 1981). 
Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (breeders), 13 weeks of age, were exposed by 
inhalation to 0 (controls) or 2500 ppm [6500 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride (99.97% pure) for 4 h 
per day on 5 days per week for an initial 7-week period during  which 54 exposed females 
and 60 control females became pregnant and delivere d young. Exposed dams then con-
tinued to receive vinyl chloride by inhalation for 7 h per day on 5 days per week for an 
additional 69 weeks. Offspring [details of delivery  and perinatal husbandry not given] 
were exposed with their dams pre- and postnatally d uring the initial 7-week exposure 
period, and were then either exposed similarly to their dam s for 7 h per day on 5 days per 
week for a further 69 weeks (63 males, 64 females; Group I) or for a shorter 8-week 
period (60 males, 60 females; Group II). Control of fspring were 158 males and 149 
females. Hepatocarcinomas occurred in 5/54 exposed female breeders and 0/60 control 
breeders, in 27/64 male and 38/63 female Group I of fspring, in 42/60 male and 43/60 
female Group II offspring and in 1/158 control male  and 0/149 control female offspring. 
Angiosarcomas [origin not specified; presumably hep atic] occurred in 27/54 exposed 
female breeders, in 36/64 male and 46/63 female Gro up I offspring and 24/60 male and 
28/60 female Group II offspring. No angiosarcomas w ere seen in 60 control breeders or in 
158 male and 149 female control offspring. Latencie s for both hepatocellular carcinomas 388 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 and angiosarcomas averaged approximately 52 weeks i n Group I offspring and approx-
imately 80 weeks in Group II offspring. Tumours in the brain described as ‘neuro-
blastomas’ were seen in vinyl chloride-exposed rats  only: 32/54 female breeders, 31/64 
male and 27/63 female Group I offspring and 7/60 ma le and 11/60 female Group II 
offspring (Maltoni & Cotti, 1988). [The Working Group note d that these latter neoplasms 
occurred at a high frequency in vinyl chloride-expo sed adult rats which is unprecedented 
for primary brain tumours in bioassays; that this d iagnosis has not been established in 
other bioassays of vinyl chloride or other chemical s; and that the photomicrographs and 
the preferential location of the tumours in the anterior fro ntal lobes support the alternative 
diagnosis of an origin in the metabolically active olfactory neuroepithelium of the pos-
terior nasal cavity (aesthesioneuroepithelioma).] 
3.7 Carcinogenicity of metabolites 
Mouse 
Local tumours (mainly fibrosarcomas) were observed in 15/28 male, 12/24 female 
and 0/30 control male XVIInc/Z mice, 8–10 weeks of age, following 32 subcutaneous 
injections of 0 (controls) or 0.1 mg chloroethylene  oxide [purity unspecified] over 42 
weeks (the experiment was terminated 36.5 weeks pos t-exposure). Chloroethylene oxide 
increased the incidence of skin papillomas and carc inomas in male XVIInc/Z mice in a 
classical initiation–promotion experiment (chloroet hylene oxide was used as an initiator 
and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [TPA] as a promote r) (skin papilloma, 18/28 
versus 4/28 TPA controls; skin carcinoma, 5/28 vers us 0/28 TPA controls), whereas 
chloroacetaldehyde [purity unspecified]did not prod uce such tumours under comparable 
conditions (Zajdela et al. , 1980). 
Chloroacetaldehyde ( ≥ 95% pure with no identifiable impurities) slightly  increased 
the incidence of hepatocellular tumours (10/26 vers us 3/20 controls [not significant]) in 
male B6C3F 1 mice when administered orally in the drinking-wate r at a mean daily 
ingested dose of 17 mg/kg bw per day for 104 weeks (Daniel et al ., 1992).  
3.8 Co-exposure with modifying agents 
Rat 
Groups of 80 male Sprague-Dawley rats [age not spec ified] were used in a 2 × 2 
factorial design and were exposed by whole-body inh alation to 1500 mg/m 3 [577 ppm] 
vinyl chloride (99.9% pure) for 4 h per day on 5 da ys per week for 12 months and were 
then held for an additional 18 months. Animals were k ept until spontaneous death or were 
killed at the end of the 18-month post-exposure obs ervation period. Additional groups 
were exposed to vinyl chloride and ingested 5% etha nol in water (v/v), were exposed to 
filtered air and ethanol or were exposed to filtere d air alone. Ingestion of 5% ethanol was 
begun 4 weeks before inhalation of vinyl chloride a nd continued for life or until ter- VINYL CHLORIDE 389  
 
 mination of the study 30 months after the first viny l chloride exposure. No information on 
survival was provided. The incidence of hepatocellu lar carcinomas was: 1/80 control, 
8/80 ethanol-treated, 35/80 vinyl chloride-treated and 48/80 vinyl chloride plus ethanol-
treated rats; that of liver angiosarcomas was: 0/80  control, 0/80 ethanol-treated, 18/80 
vinyl chloride-treated and 40/80 vinyl chloride plu s ethanol-treated rats; that of pituitary 
tumours was: 8/80 control, 26/80 ethanol-treated, 1 9/80 vinyl chloride-treated and 12/80 
vinyl chloride plus ethanol-treated; and that of ly mphosarcomas was 2/80 control, 4/80 
ethanol-treated, 6/80 vinyl chloride-treated and 11 /80 vinyl chloride plus ethanol-treated 
rats. The authors stated that these results indicat e that ethanol potentiates the carcino-
genicity of vinyl chloride (Radike et al. , 1981). [The Working Group noted that isocaloric 
and isonutrient intakes were not controlled in eith er the treated or control groups.] 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
4.1.1  Humans 
No data on absorption, distribution, metabolism or elimination of vinyl chloride in 
humans were presented in the previous review (IARC,  1979). Since that time, a number 
of studies have contributed to the understanding of  the inhalation pharmacokinetics of 
vinyl chloride in humans. 
Pulmonary absorption of vinyl chloride in humans ap peared to be rapid and the 
percentage absorbed was independent of the concentr ation inhaled. Krajewski et al . 
(1980; cited in ATSDR, 2006) reported that adult ma le volunteers exposed for 6 h to 2.9, 
5.8, 11.6 or 23.1 ppm [7.5, 15, 30 or 60 mg/m 3] by gas mask retained on average 
approximately 42% of inhaled vinyl chloride. Pulmon ary uptake is determined in part by 
the blood:air partition coefficient, which is 1.16 for vinyl chloride (Gargas et al ., 1989). 
No data were available on human tissue:blood partit ion coefficients or tissue 
concentrations of vinyl chloride in exposed humans.  However, calculations based on the 
assumption of an identical solubility of vinyl chlo ride in rodent and human tissues 
indicate that the tissue:blood partition coefficien ts of vinyl chloride would be twofold 
greater in humans (Clewell et al ., 2001), as a consequence of the twofold lower blo od:air 
partition coefficient of vinyl chloride in humans c ompared with rats and mice.  
Vinyl chloride is primarily and rapidly metabolized  in the liver, and this metabolism 
is saturable (Bolt, 2005). The proposed metabolic p athways for vinyl chloride are 
presented in Figure 1. The first step in the metabo lism of vinyl chloride is oxidation, 
which is predominantly mediated by human cytochrome  P450 (CYP) 2E1, to form the 
highly reactive chloroethylene oxide, which can spo ntaneously rearrange to chloro-
acetaldehyde (Barbin et al ., 1975). Both metabolites can bind with proteins, DNA and 
RNA and form etheno-adducts; chloroethylene oxide i s the most reactive with nucleotides  390 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

CYP, cytochrome P450; (u), excreted in urine  VINYL CHLORIDE 391  
 
 (Guengerich et al.,  1979). Conjugation of chloroethylene oxide and chl oroacetaldehyde 
with glutathione (GSH) eventually leads to the majo r urinary metabolites N-acetyl-S-(2-
hydroxyethyl)cysteine and thiodiglycolic acid. Chlo roethylene oxide and chloro-
acetaldehyde can also be detoxified to glycolaldehy de by microsomal epoxide hydrolase 
(mEH) and to the urinary metabolite chloroacetic ac id by aldehyde dehydrogenase 
2 (ALDH2), respectively (Guengerich & Watanabe, 197 9; ASTDR, 2006).  
A number of in-vitro studies that used purified human CYP2E1 and liver 
microsomes confirmed that vinyl chloride is activated mainly by CYP2E1 (r eviewed 
in WHO, 1999). In hepatic postmitochondrial fractions, Sabadie et al . (1980) found 
significant interindividual variability in the metabolism of vinyl chl oride, although the 
average activity in human samples was comparable with that in rat samples.  
The main routes of elimination of vinyl chloride an d its metabolites are exhalation 
and urinary excretion, respectively. Accordingly, t hiodiglycolic acid has been reported to 
be the major metabolite of vinyl chloride detected in  the urine of exposed workers (Cheng 
et al ., 2001). Urinary levels of thiodiglycolic acid wer e correlated with levels of vinyl 
chloride in the air at concentrations of > 5 ppm (A TSDR, 2006). In contrast, exhalation of 
unmetabolized vinyl chloride has been reported to o ccur in humans at low levels (Müller 
et al ., 1978; Krajewski et al ., 1980; Pleil & Lindstrom, 1997). For example, the  mean 
concentration in expired air of humans exposed for 6 h to air  that contained 6.8–23.1 ppm 
[15–60 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride ranged from 0.21 to 1.11 ppm [0.54 –2.84 mg/m 3], which 
represented 3.6 and 4.73% of the inhaled amounts, r espectively (Krajewski et al ,. 1980). 
4.1.2  Experimental systems 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimin ation of vinyl chloride in rats and 
mice have been reviewed (IARC, 1979; WHO, 1999; ATS DR, 2006). The following 
section summarizes the salient features of the studies revi ewed in IARC (1979) as well as 
significant new information on the metabolism and p harmacokinetics of vinyl chloride in 
animals. 
Animal data have demonstrated that pulmonary and ga strointestinal absorption of 
vinyl chloride occurs readily and rapidly. On the c ontrary, dermal absorption of airborne 
vinyl chloride is probably not significant. In monk eys, Hefner et al . (1975a) reported that 
only 0.023–0.031% of the total available vinyl chlo ride was absorbed by the dermal route, 
whereas absorption in rats was virtually complete f ollowing single oral doses (44–
92 mg/kg bw) of vinyl chloride in aqueous solution (Withey, 1976). When rats were 
exposed to initial concentrations of < 260 mg/m 3 [100 ppm], about 40% of inhaled 
[14 C]vinyl chloride was absorbed by the lung (Bolt et al ., 1976). 
The tissue:blood partition coefficients (which dete rmine the volume of distribution) of 
vinyl chloride range from 0.4 (muscle) to 10 (fat) in male rats (Barton et al ., 1995). The 
fat:air partition coefficient for vinyl chloride, r eported by several authors, tended to be 
higher in female than in male rats (WHO, 1999). Bol t et al . (1976) reported that, 
following inhalation exposure to [ 14 C]vinyl chloride, several tissues (brain, liver, sp leen, 392 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 kidney, adipose tissue and muscle) contained radioa ctivity, and that the highest levels 
were found in liver and kidney. Ungvary et al . (1978) reported that vinyl chloride was 
present in fetal blood and amniotic fluid following  exposure of pregnant rats on gestation 
day 18 to ~2000–13 000 ppm [5500–33 000 mg/m 3] (2.5-h exposures), which indicates 
that vinyl chloride crossed the placental barrier. 
Osterman-Golkar et al . (1977) reported the alkylation of cysteine and hi stidine of 
haemoglobin and small amounts of alkylated histidin e in proteins from the testis mice 
exposed to [ 14 C]vinyl chloride. 
The metabolism of vinyl chloride to chloroethylene oxide, the probable carcinogenic 
metabolite, appears to be a saturable, dose-depende nt process that occurs in the liver 
predominantly through the CYP system (Reynolds et al ., 1975; Ivanetich et al ., 1977; 
Barbin & Bartsch, 1989; Lilly et al ., 1998; Bolt, 2005). CYP2E1 appears to account for  
all metabolic activity in rat liver microsomes, wit h a maximum velocity (V max ) of 
4674 pmol/mg protein/min and a Michaelis-Menten con stant (K m) of 7.42 µmol/L (El 
Ghissassi et al ., 1998). Since CYP2E1 has been demonstrated to be present in several 
other tissues at low levels (compared with the live r), it is reasonable to anticipate that 
extrahepatic metabolism of systemically available v inyl chloride occurs 
Inhibitors of CYP, such as 3-bromophenyl-4(5)-imida zole or 6-nitro-1,2,3-
benzothiadiazole, reduced the metabolism of vinyl c hloride in  vivo  (Bolt et al ., 1976). 
Chloroethylene oxide, which has a half-life of 1.6 min in aqueous solution at neutral pH 
(Barbin et al ., 1975), rearranges to chloroacetaldehyde (Bonse et al ., 1975), conjugates 
with GSH and can be hydrolysed by EH to glycolaldeh yde (WHO, 1999). Chloro-
acetaldehyde combines directly or enzymatically via glutathione- S-transferase (GST) with 
GSH to form S-formylmethyl glutathione, which is excreted as N-acety1-S-(2-hydroxy-
ethyl)cysteine (Green & Hathway, 1977) (Figure 1). Chloroacetaldehyde can be oxidized 
to chloroacetic acid, which is either excreted as s uch or bound to GSH to form S-carboxy-
methyl glutathione, which, upon further enzymic deg radation, is excreted as thiodi-
glycolic acid (thiodiacetic acid) (Plugge & Safe, 1 977). 
Chloroacetic acid was metabolized in rats to two ma jor urinary metabolites, 
S-carboxymethyl cysteine and thiodiacetic acid (Ylln er, 1971). N-Acetyl-S-(2-hydroxy-
ethyl)cysteine (a major metabolite) (Watanabe et  al ., 1976a,b; Green & Hathway, 1977), 
S-(carboxymethyl)cysteine and N-acetyl-S-vinyl cysteine have been shown to be metab-
olites of vinyl chloride in rats after oral adminis tration (Green & Hathway, 1977) and 
N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine after inhalation (Watanab e et al ., 1976b); 
S-(2-chloroethyl)cysteine was also identified after oral administration of vinyl chloride to 
rats (Green & Hathway, 1975). As thiodiglycolic aci d was obtained as a common metab-
olite in rats dosed separately with chloroacetaldeh yde, chloroacetic acid or S-(carboxy-
methyl)cysteine, the identification of the same S-containing metabolite from vinyl 
chloride-treated animals gives further support to t he hypothesis that chloroethylene oxide 
or chloroacetaldehyde are formed and react with GSH  (Green & Hathway, 1977).  VINYL CHLORIDE 393  
 
 Following oral administration of [ 14 C]vinyl chloride, [ 14 C]carbon dioxide (Green & 
Hathway, 1975; Watanabe et al ., 1976a), 14 C-labelled urea and glutamic acid were iden-
tified as minor metabolites (Green & Hathway, 1975) . 
Saturation of the metabolism of vinyl chloride (Geh ring et al ., 1978; Filser & Bolt, 
1979) appears to occur at an inhalation concentration of ab ove 200 ppm [518.6 mg/m 3] in 
rhesus monkeys (Buchter et al ., 1980) and 250 ppm [648 mg/m 3] in rats (Bolt et al ., 1977; 
Filser & Bolt, 1979). The plateau of incidence of h epatic angiosarcoma in rat 
carcinogenicity bioassays is also observed at above  250 ppm (reviewed in Bolt, 2005). 
ATSDR (2006) summarized the kinetic constants obtai ned in vivo  in male Sprague-
Dawley rats (V max , 58 µmol/h/kg; K m,  1 µM) and rhesus monkeys (V max , 50 µmol/h/kg) 
(based on Buchter et al ., 1980; Barton et al ., 1995). The V max  of 50 µmol/h/kg in rhesus 
monkeys was suggested to be a closer approximation of metabolism in humans than the 
value of 110 µmol/h/kg estimated for rats by Filser  and Bolt (1979) (ATSDR, 2006). 
Although vinyl chloride has not been associated wit h the induction of CYP, several 
authors reported the destruction of CYP protein fol lowing exposures to vinyl chloride 
(WHO, 1999). However, Watanabe et al . (1978a) reported that the rate of elimination of 
vinyl chloride was not altered during repeated expo sures (5 days per week for 7 weeks) 
compared with single inhalation exposure (~13 000 m g/m 3 [5000 ppm]). 
Urinary excretion of polar metabolites is the predo minant process of elimination at 
low concentrations of exposure, and very small amou nts are expired in air as unchanged 
vinyl chloride (Hefner et al ., 1975b). Following exposure of male rats by inhal ation to 
26 mg/m 3 [10 ppm] [ 14 C]vinyl chloride for 6 h, urinary 14 C activity and expired vinyl 
chloride comprised 68 and 2%, respectively, of the recovered radioactivity; after exposure 
to 2600 mg/m 3 [1000 ppm] [ 14 C]vinyl chloride, the proportion of radioactivity i n the urine 
was lower and that expired as vinyl chloride was hi gher, and represented 56 and 12%, 
respectively (Watanabe et al ., 1976b). Following a single oral administration of 0.05, 1 or 
100 mg/kg bw [ 14 C]vinyl chloride to male rats, excretion in the uri ne was 68, 59 and 11%, 
respectively; [ 14 C]carbon dioxide in expired air accounted for 9, 13  and 3%, respectively; 
pulmonary elimination of unchanged vinyl chloride r epresented only 1–3% of the lower 
dose and 67% of the higher dose (Watanabe et al ., 1976a). These data are consistent with 
the fact that, once metabolic saturation is attained,  the elimination of vinyl chloride occurs 
via other routes, mainly exhalation of the parent c hemical. The route of elimination also 
depends upon the route of administration; urinary e xcretion is favoured following oral or 
intraperitoneal administration, which indicates a f irst-pass effect due to metabolism in the 
liver (reviewed in Clewell et al ., 2001). 
Several investigators have observed the binding of non-volatile metabolites of 
[14 C]vinyl chloride to liver macromolecules, both in vitro  and in rats exposed by inha-
lation (Kappus et al . 1976; Watanabe et al ., 1978a,b; Guengerich & Watanabe, 1979; 
Guengerich et al ., 1979; Bolt et al ., 1980; Guengerich et al ., 1981; Barton et al ., 1995). 
Jedrychowski et al.  (1984) reported a decrease in non-protein sulfhydr yl concentration in 
rats exposed to high concentrations of vinyl chlori de, and Kappus et al . (1975) and Laib 
and Bolt (1977) reported binding of vinyl chloride to RNA in vitro  and in vivo . In single-394 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 exposure experiments at various concentrations, the  extent of macromolecular binding 
increased proportionately to the amount of vinyl ch loride metabolized and dispropor-
tionately to the exposure concentration (Watanabe et al ., 1978b).   
4.1.3   Toxicokinetic models 
The data on absorption, distribution, metabolism an d excretion of vinyl chloride have 
been analysed with the use of empirical and physiologica lly based compartmental models 
(Gehring et al ., 1978; Chen & Blancato, 1989; Clewell et al ., 1995; Reitz et al ., 1996; 
Clewell et al ., 2001). These models indicate that vinyl chloride  is rapidly absorbed by the 
inhalation and oral routes and is distributed to al l tissues; the adipose tissues show the 
greatest affinity. The physiologically based pharma cokinetic models developed by Chen 
and Blancato (1989), Clewell et al . (1995, 2001) and Reitz et al . (1996) permit the 
prediction of the pharmacokinetics, GSH depletion a nd the amount of vinyl chloride 
metabolized in animals and/or humans exposed to var ious concentrations by different 
routes and schedules. However, these models do not currently permit the simulation of the 
time course of the formation and persistence of DNA  adducts in target tissues. 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
Since the last review of vinyl chloride (IARC, 1979 ), a large amount of data on vinyl 
chloride has been produced and reviewed (WHO, 1999) . Only the more recent data that 
are relevant to the comprehension of vinyl chloride -induced carcinogenicity are reported 
in this section. 
4.2.1  Humans 
(a) DNA adducts 
In vitro , both chloroethylene oxide, the biologically react ive intermediate of vinyl 
chloride that is formed in the liver, and its rearr angement product, chloroacetaldehyde, 
can form etheno adducts with nucleic acid bases. Ch loroethylene oxide has, however, 
greater reactivity and it was shown in vitro  to be the main entity that gives rise to etheno 
adducts (Guengerich, 1992). The reaction of 2-chlor oethylene oxide with nucleic acid 
bases yields the N-7-(2-oxoethyl)guanine adduct (7-OEG) and four ethe no adducts—
1, N6-ethenoadenine ( εA), 3, N4-ethenocytosine ( εC), N2,3-ethenoguanine ( N2,3-εG) and 
1, N2-ethenoguanine (1, N2-εG) (Figure 2) (Ciroussel et al. , 1990; Guengerich, 1992). 
Another adduct, formed by chloroethylene oxide, 5,6 ,7,9-tetrahydro-7-hydroxy-9-
oxoimidazo[1,2- a]purine (HO-ethanoG), has also been identified in vitro  (Müller et al ., 
1996).  
Data on the occurrence and persistence of DNA adduct s in tissues of humans exposed 
to vinyl chloride are lacking. Only one study that used immunoaffinity purification of the 
etheno adducts and subsequent 32 P-postlabelling reported levels of 14.1 εA and 8.1 εC per  VINYL CHLORIDE 395  
 
 10 9 parent bases in non-neoplastic liver tissue of a v inyl chloride-exposed patient with 
hepatocellular carcinoma (Nair et al ., 1995). These adducts can also result from lipid 
peroxidation (El Ghissassi et al ., 1995) and their level can be quite high (in the range of 
≤ 0.5–40 εA and εC per 10 9 parent bases in liver DNA samples from patients wi th 
unknown exposure) (Bartsch & Nair, 2000a,b).

(b) Mutations and other related effects 
(i) Mutated p21 ras  and p53 proteins in the blood of vinyl chloride-
exposed workers  
Mutated p21 ras  and p53 proteins in the blood of vinyl chloride-ex posed workers may 
reflect the mutagenic effects of vinyl chloride. A G →A transition at the second base of 
codon 13 of the Ki- ras  gene was found in four liver angiosarcomas that we re associated 
with occupational exposure to vinyl chloride (Mario n et al ., 1991). The resulting 
Asp13p21 ras  protein was also detected in the serum of these fo ur patients by immuno-
histochemistry using a monoclonal antibody specific  for the Asp13p21 ras  protein 
(De Vivo et al ., 1994). The presence of the mutant RAS protein in  the blood correlates 
with the mutated ras  gene in the tumour (Table 16). 
Several studies showed a high concentration of the Asp13p21 ras mutant protein in the 
sera of workers who had been heavily exposed to vin yl chloride whereas all unexposed 
controls showed negative results. In addition, these studies fo und a significant dose– 396 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

Mutated p53 proteins and/or anti-p53 antibodies were also  found in the blood of vinyl 
chloride-exposed patients. In a pilot study, Triver s et al . (1995) analysed 148 serum 
samples from 92 vinyl chloride-exposed workers from  factories in France and industrial 
plants in Kentucky, USA. Serum anti-p53 antibodies were found in five of 15 workers 
who had liver angiosarcoma (33%), two of whom had c onfirmed mutated p53  gene 
(Hollstein et al ., 1994), and in four (5%) of 77 workers with no cl inical evidence of 
cancer. Two of 26 workers who had clinical symptoms  of vinyl chloride toxicity had 
antibodies that were detectable by enzyme immunoass ays. No antibodies were detected in 
the two workers who had hepatocellular carcinoma or  in seven of eight workers who had 
liver angiomas. In two liver angiosarcoma patients,  anti-p53 antibodies were detected 
4 months and 11 years, respectively, before the dia gnosis of cancer and one patient had 
anti-p53 antibodies before and after surgery. Anti- p53 antibodies were thought to be the 
result of earlier antigenic presentation to the imm une system, through accumulation of the 
mutated protein. 
The main purpose of these studies was to determine whether the expression of serum 
biomarkers was indeed related to exposure to vinyl chloride. The finding of a significant 
dose–response relationship strongly supports this h ypothesis and confirms that RAS  gene 
mutations are involved in the onset of liver angios arcoma induced by vinyl chloride and 
that mutant p21 ras  plays a key role in the development of vinyl chloride-induced liver  VINYL CHLORIDE 397

mutated p53 in blood and exposure to vinyl chloride  (Tables 19 and 20). 
Anti-p53 antibodies have also been tested as a poss ible biomarker of exposure to 
vinyl chloride. The occurrence of anti-p53 antibodi es in the blood of vinyl chloride-
exposed workers seems to be related to the level of  exposure with a threshold 
[~1000 ppm–years]. Below this threshold, this effec t is not detected (Table 21). 
When two markers, Asp13p21 ras  and mutated p53, were tested against exposure to 
vinyl chloride, each biomarker alone demonstrated a  highly statistically significant trend 
with exposure ( p < 0.0001). Similarly, a highly statistically signi ficant increase was 
observed in the serum concentration of one or both of the biomarkers with increasing 
exposure (Table 22). 
(ii) Cytogenetic studies of vinyl chloride-exposed workers 
Studies on the genotoxicity of vinyl chloride, incl uding studies of chromosomal 
aberrations, micronucleus formation and sister chro matid exchange, have recently been 
reviewed (WHO, 1999). There was a clear relationship betwe en the incidence of chromo-
somal aberrations and exposure concentration, altho ugh exposure concentration and 
duration of exposure were only estimated. Lesser or  no effects were seen when the expo-
sure was reduced to levels < 5 ppm [< 13 mg/m 3]. 
The frequency of sister chromatid exchange increase d with the level of exposure to 
vinyl chloride, and sister chromatid exchange was g enerally not detected in the blood of 
workers exposed to levels < 5 ppm [< 13 mg/m 3]. A recent study conducted to investigate 
the genotoxicity of vinyl chloride at low levels co nfirmed the absence of sister chromatid 
exchange in the blood of workers exposed to vinyl c hloride levels of approximately 
1 ppm [2.59 mg/m 3] (Cheng et al ., 2000).

breaks was found to be significantly higher in work ers exposed to levels of vinyl chloride

(iii) Mutations at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase (HPRT) locus 
With the HPRT  lymphocyte clonal assay, it is possible to determi ne the mutation 
frequency of the HPRT  gene and to characterize its mutant spectra. Mutag enesis induced 
in the lymphocytes of PVC production workers was me asured by selecting resistant 
mutant T cells in a medium that contained 6-thiogua nine. Exposed workers and controls 
had similar mutation frequencies. However, great di fferences occurred in the spectrum of 
mutants. In particular, the percentage of large del etions in the exposed group was much 
higher (21%) than in unexposed controls (11%) (Hüttner & Ho lzapfel, 1996). The mutant 
frequency of HPRT  in T lymphocytes of 29 individuals accidentally ex posed to levels of 
vinyl chloride between 1 and 8 ppm [2.6–20.7 mg/m 3] was measured after the accident 
and in a follow-up study 2 years later. A statistic ally significantly higher cloning 
efficiency was observed in the exposed population a fter the accident (68.1 versus 50.7% 
in the controls; p = 0.007, Mann-Whitney test). However, no significa nt difference in the 
mutant frequency could be found between the exposed  population and controls 
(3.28 ± 1.84 × 10 –6 versus 3.01 ± 2.38 × 10 –6) (Becker et al ., 2001).

 The DNA adducts εA and εC have been found in various organs in rats after i nhalation 
exposure to vinyl chloride. 7-OEG was shown to be t he major DNA adduct formed in 
vivo and was found in greater amounts in young animals  (Swenberg et al ., 2000). 
However, 7-OEG has a short half-life of about 62 h while etheno adducts were more 
persistent. For example, N2,3-εG has a half-life of about 30 days (Fedtke et al ., 1990). Of 
the etheno adducts, N2,3 -εG was present in greatest amounts in tissues of expos ed animals 
(10–100-fold greater than other etheno adducts).  
After exposure of rats to 500 ppm [1300 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride for 8 weeks, the level 
of εA was increased significantly above background in t he liver, lung, lymphocytes and 
testis. The level of εC was also increased significantly in the liver, ki dney, lymphocytes 
and spleen. No significant increase was found in br ain for either ethano adducts (Guichard 
et al ., 1996; Barbin, 1999). When adult rats were expose d to 1100 ppm [2858 mg/m 3] 
vinyl chloride for 1 or 4 weeks, there was a signif icant increase in the level of N2,3 -εG in 
hepatocytes, but not in the brain. In contrast to a dults, there was a small, statistically 
significant increase in N2,3 -εG in the brain of weanling animals exposed for 5 da ys. In 
addition, in weanlings, the concentration of N2,3 -εG in hepatocytes was significantly 
greater than that measured in non-parenchymal cells  after exposures to 10 and 100 ppm 
[26 and 259 mg/m 3 ] vinyl chloride (Morinello et al ., 2002a). These differential responses 
between weanlings and adults may contribute to the particu lar susceptibility of young rats 
to vinyl chloride-induced neuroblastomas and hepato carcinomas (Maltoni & Cotti, 1988).  
In adult rats, N2,3 -εG was clearly induced in both hepatocytes and non-p arenchymal 
cells after exposure to vinyl chloride for 1 or 4 w eeks, with a linear increase at exposure 
concentrations from 0 to 100 ppm [259 mg/m 3] and a plateau at levels of 100–1100 ppm 
[259–2852 mg/m3]. There was no significant difference in N2,3 -εG adduct levels, nor in 
the rate of repair between hepatocytes and non-pare nchymal cells (Morinello et al ., 
2002b), which confirms the earlier observation of Y ang et al . (2000) (see also Table 23).  
(b) Mutations and other related effects  (see Table 24)   
Genotoxicity studies on vinyl chloride  in vitro  and in vivo  have recently been 
reviewed (WHO, 1999). The genotoxicity of vinyl chlo ride has been clearly demonstrated 
in several in -vitro systems. Vinyl chloride vapour induced revers e mutation in various 
strains of Salmonella typhymurium . In aqueous or alcoholic solutions, vinyl chloride  in-
duced mutations in Escherichia coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and  Schizosaccharomyces 
pombe . It was also mutagenic in the recessive lethal tes t in Drosophila melanogaster,  but 
not in the dominant lethal test in mice. It induced  DNA strand breaks, sister chromatid 
exchange, micronucleus formation and chromosomal ab errations in rodents. In vitro , a 
higher mutagenic response was obtained in the prese nce of an exogenous metabolic 
activation system from rat liver. 406 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97

 4.2.3   Mutagenic or promutagenic properties of DNA adducts formed by vinyl 
chloride metabolites 
The major DNA adduct 7-OEG lacks miscoding properti es (Barbin et al ., 1985). In 
contrast, promutagenic properties have been shown f or the etheno and related exocyclic 
DNA adducts, εΑ, ε C, N2,3 -εG, and HO-ethanoG that involve mainly base-pair sub -
stitution mutations (WHO, 1999; see Table 25) 
Various assays have been designed to explore the mu tagenic properties of DNA 
adducts, which have been incorporated into oligonuc leotides or into site-specific vectors 
and used in experiments of misincorporation. Vector plasmids have also been treated with 
2-chloroethyleneoxide or 2-chloroacetaldehyde and p ropagated in E. coli  or mammalian 
cells. The more significant and recent studies are listed in Table 25. The mechanism by 
which adducts cause mutations still remains unclear . At least two vinyl chloride-induced 
DNA adducts, HO-ethanoG and 1,  N2-εG have been shown to block replication with 
many different polymerases, thereby causing base mi sincorporation (Langouët et al.,  
1997, 1998; Guengerich et al ., 1999). The misincorporation events appear to be clearly 
dependent on the individual mechanisms of DNA polym erases (Choi et al.,  2006). 
Mutation frequencies induced by etheno adducts may also depend on the system used 
since εA was shown to be highly miscoding in COS7 simian k idney cells, in contrast to 
the findings in E. coli  (Pandaya & Moriya, 1996). [Clearly, the patterns o f base 
substitution vary among the different systems used and cannot be extrapolated easily to 
predict mutations in human tumour tissue.] 
4.2.4  Alterations in oncogenes and suppressor-genes in tumours 
(a) RAS genes 
Carcinogens are believed to alter genes that are in volved in cell proliferation and 
differentiation. The RAS  genes, Ha- ras , Ki-ras  and N-ras , are members of a family of 
genes that code for closely homologous proteins tha t are termed p21 ras  and function as 
signal-switch molecules in the cell. RAS  genes activated by point mutations are found in a 
wide variety of human cancers. In a study of mutati ons of RAS  oncogenes at codons 12, 
13 and 61 in angiosarcomas of the liver of vinyl ch loride-exposed workers, five of six 
tumours were found to contain a G →A transition at the second base of codon 13 
(GGC →GAC) of the Ki- ras-2 gene (Marion et al ., 1991). This mutation leads to 
substitution of glycine by aspartic acid at amino a cid residue 13 in the encoded p21 ras  
protein. In another series, eight of 15 tumours con tained a mutated Ki- ras  gene, either at 
codon 12 or at codon 13. In five cases, the mutatio n led to substitution of glycine by 
aspartic acid. Two mutations were also found in non -neoplastic tissue (Weihrauch et al ., 
2002a). 
In studies of hepatocellular carcinomas of vinyl ch loride-exposed workers, three

 in one tumour (GGT →TGT). In addition, one tumour contained a mutation due to a 
G→T transversion at the second base of codon 12 (GGT →GTT) in neoplastic tissue and 
a G →A transition at the second base of codon 12 in non- neoplastic tissue (GGT →GAT). 
One tumour contained a mutation at the first base o f codon 13 (G →T transversion, 
GGC →TGC) in neoplastic tissue and a G →A transition at the second base of codon 13 in 
non-neoplastic tissue (GGC →GAC). In one case, the wild-type Ki- ras -2 gene was detec-
ted in neoplastic tissue while a codon 13 mutation was found in non-neoplastic cirrhotic 
tissue (GGC →CAT) (Weinrauch et al ., 2001a). In the same study, 20 hepatocellular 
carcinomas from a control group and associated with  hepatitis B or C virus infection or 
alcoholic beverage consumption were also analysed. Ki-ras -2 mutations were found in 
three cases, two of which were attributed to HBV in fection (GGT →GTT and GGC →GAC) 
and one to hepatitis C virus infection (GGT →TGT) (Weihrauch et al ., 2001a,b).  
No mutations were found in the Ki- ras  gene in vinyl chloride-induced liver angio-
sarcoma or hepatocellular carcinoma in rats. One mu tation was found at codon 13 of 
N-ras  in a liver angiosarcoma (G →A, GGC →GAC). However, mutations that involved 
the second base of codon 61 of the Ha- ras  gene and were due to A →T transversions 
(CAA →CTA) were found in five of eight hepatocellular car cinomas (Froment et al ., 
1994; Boivin-Angèle et al ., 2000a) (Table 26). 
(b) p53 
The p53  gene is a tumour-suppressor gene at the crossroads  of many cellular 
pathways that involve cell cycle control, DNA repai r, DNA replication, apoptosis and 
senescence. The majority of cancer-related mutation s in p53  cluster in several regions of 
the gene that determine the protein structure and that ha ve been highly conserved through 
evolution. These regions occur in the sequence-spec ific DNA-binding core domain of the 
protein between amino acid residues 102 and 292. Th e mutations found in malignancies 
could result in substitution of amino acid residues  in these regions that are critical for p53 
function (Cho et al ., 1994; Brandt-Rauf et al ., 1996). 
A comparison of the mutation spectra in the p53  gene in vinyl chloride-associated 
liver tumours in humans and rats is detailed in Tab le 27. 
Five liver tumours (four liver angiosarcomas and on e hepatocellular carcinoma) from 
workers who were heavily exposed to vinyl chloride were investigated for mutations in 
the p53  gene in exons 5 to 8. Two A →T missense mutations were found in a highly 
conserved domain: one at codon 249 (AGG →TGG, Arg  to Trp ) and one at codon 255 
(ATC →TTC, Ile  to Phe ) each in the tumour but not in the normal cells of two of the liv er 
angiosarcoma patients, of whom both were smokers (H ollstein et al ., 1994). A third 
mutation, also due to an A →T transversion, was found at codon 179 (CAT →CTT, His  to 
Leu ) in a fibroblastic cell line established from a li ver angiosarcoma from a vinyl 
chloride-exposed patient (Boivin-Angèle et al ., 2000b). Such mutations are uncommon in 
human cancers (2.7% of a total of 5085 cancers; Hol lstein et al ., 1996). Futhermore, p53  gene 
mutations are uncommon in sporadic (non-vinyl chloride-induced ) liver angiosarcomas  VINYL CHLORIDE 411

 (2/21 cases, 9%; Soini et al ., 1995), which supports the evidence that links ex posure to 
vinyl chloride with liver angiosarcoma that contain s p53  mutations due to A →T 
transversions. 
In another series, six mutations were found in 17 v inyl chloride-induced liver 
angiosarcomas (four point mutations and two deletions); only one mutation was due to an 
A→T transversion (codon 131, AAC →ATC) (Weihrauch et al ., 2002b). 
Eighteen hepatocellular carcinomas from vinyl chlor ide-exposed workers were 
analysed for mutations in the p53  gene in exons 5–9. In this series, 11 of 18 hepatoc ellular 
carcinomas exhibited a p53  gene mutation, with five transversions and five tr ansitions. 
Five of the 11 mutations (codons 175, 245, 248, 273  and 282) affected CpG dinu-
cleotides, three of which (codons 175, 248, 273) we re also found in hepatocellular 
carcinomas induced by alcoholic beverage consumptio n and viral or autoimmune cir-
rhosis, which led the authors to conclude that the p53  mutations in their series might be 
due to spontaneous processes such as deamination of 5-methy lcytosine (Weihrauch et al ., 
2000). In studies of both liver angiosarcoma and he patocellular carcinoma, no p53  
mutations were found in the surrounding non-neoplas tic tissue. 
Mutations in the p53  gene were also found in 11 of 25 (44%) liver angio sarcomas 
induced by vinyl chloride in Sprague-Dawley rats an d in one of eight hepatocellular 
carcinomas (Barbin et al ., 1997). Five mutations involved an A →T transversion as seen 
in human vinyl chloride-induced liver angiosarcoma.  The A →T transversion in the first 
base of codon 253 in two rat liver angiosarcomas wa s equivalent to the transversion 
observed in codon 255 in one human liver angiosarco ma associated with exposure to 
vinyl chloride (Hollstein et al ., 1994) (Table 27). 
4.3 Mechanisms of carcinogenesis 
Many key events in the pathway of vinyl chloride-induced he patocarcinogenesis have 
been established. These include ( a) metabolic activation (to chloroethylene oxide), 
(b) DNA binding of the reactive metabolites (characte ristic exocyclic etheno-adducts, 
(c) promutagenicity of these adducts that lead to G →A and A →T transitions and 
(d) effects of such mutations on proto-oncogenes/tumo ur-suppressor genes at the gene 
and gene product levels, with tumorigenesis as the final outcome (Bolt, 2005). 
Vinyl chloride has been demonstrated to be a genoto xic carcinogen in animal and 
human studies (Block, 1974; Creech & Johnson, 1974;  Lee & Harry, 1974; Maltoni et al ., 
1974, 1981). It is absorbed rapidly after inhalatio n and oral exposure (Bolt , 1978), and is 
metabolized (activated) mainly by CYP2E1 to 2-chlor oethylene oxide which spon-
taneously rearranges to 2-chloroacetaldehyde. 2-Chl oroethylene oxide and 2-chloro-
acetaldehyde can be transported intercellularly fro m parenchymal cells to non-paren-
chymal cells in the liver (Kuchenmeister et al ., 1996). The primary detoxification reaction 
of the two reactive metabolites is conjugation with  GSH catalysed by GST; the 
conjugation products are then excreted in urine (re viewed in WHO, 1999).  414 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 Both 2-chloroethylene oxide and 2-chloroacetaldehyd e can form DNA adducts. Five 
DNA adducts are formed by 2-chloroethylene oxide or  2-chloroacetaldehyde (Cheng et 
al ., 1991; Basu et al ., 1993). These include the major adduct, 7-OEG, an d four cyclic 
etheno adducts (1, N2-εG, εC, εA and N2,3-εG). These etheno adducts generate mainly 
base-pair substitution mutations and specific mutat ions in cancer-related genes (i.e. RAS  
oncogenes, p53  tumour-suppressor genes). The major reaction produ ct of 2-chloro-
ethylene oxide is 7-OEG, but 2-chloroacetaldehyde d oes not form this adduct. 7-OEG 
does not exhibit promutagenic properties whereas εA, εC, N2,3-εG and 1, N2-εG do. εA, 
εC and N2,3-εG have demonstrated miscoding potential in vitro  and in vivo  (Singer et al ., 
1987; Cheng et al ., 1991; Mroczkowska & Kusmierek, 1991; Singer et al ., 1991; Basu et 
al ., 1993) and others have shown that εA causes A →G transitions and A →T trans-
versions, εC causes C →A transversions and C →T transitions and εG causes G →A 
transitions (reviewed in Bolt, 2005; see Table 25).  These changes were consistent with the 
mutations of p53  and RAS  genes observed in tumours from vinyl chloride-expo sed 
humans and rats (Tables 26 and 27). 
Etheno adducts appear to have long persistence and are repaired by glycolases (Gros 
et al ., 2004). In addition to the DNA adducts produced b y vinyl chloride, a physiological 
background of endogenously produced etheno adducts is possibly the product of oxi-
dative stress and lipid peroxidation (Bartsch & Nai r, 2000a,b; De Bont & van Larebeke, 
2004; Bolt, 2005). 
The induction of extrahepatic tumours by vinyl chlo ride has been established experi-
mentally, but the mechanism for this extrahepatic t umour formation, e.g. in the brain or 
lung, is not well elucidated (Bolt, 2005). 
While the data overall suggest that etheno adducts are probably involved in the 
initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis by vinyl chlorid e, some factors have yet to be 
explained. These include observed tissue and cell s pecificity and variability in various 
biomarkers such as mutant p53 protein and anti-p53 antibodies in vinyl chloride-exposed 
workers with tumours (Trivers et al ., 1995; Brand-Rauf et al ., 1996). One source for this 
variability might be explained by differences in ge netic polymorphisms of genes that 
encode for enzymes involved in vinyl chloride metab olism and for proteins involved in 
DNA repair (Li et al ., 2003a).  
4.4 Susceptibility  
4.4.1  Genetic polymorphisms and enzyme induction  
The enzymes that are involved in vinyl chloride act ivation and detoxification, 
i.e. CYP2E1, ALDH2, GST and mEH (Figure 1), are kno wn to have polymorphic 
variants with altered activity. Polymorphisms of each of th ese enzymes may modulate the 
metabolism of vinyl chloride, the levels of 2-chlor oethylene oxide and 2-chloro-
acetaldehyde and hence the frequency and nature of vinyl chloride-induced mutations.  VINYL CHLORIDE 415  
 
 For example, individuals who have high-activity var iants of CYP2E1 and/or low-
activity variants of ALDH2 or GST enzymes may have elevated levels of chloroethylene 
oxide and chloroacetaldehyde and increased DNA dama ge.  
Among the many CYP2E1 polymorphisms described, c1  and c2  alleles have been 
identified in the 5-regulatory region of the gene. According to in-vitro studies that inves-
tigated gene transcription and enzyme activity, wor kers who have at least one c2  allele 
may have higher CYP2E1 activity than the homozygous  c1c1 , although this was not 
clearly confirmed in vivo . The frequency of the rare c2 allele is 24–30% for Asian pop-
ulations, 2–3% for Caucasians, 0.3–7% for African-A mericans, 15% for Mexican 
Americans and 18% for Chinese (Province of Taiwan) (Danko & Chaschin, 2005). The 
levels of CYP2E1 vary in human populations and have  been shown in addition to be 
induced by repetitive alcoholic beverage consumptio n and exposure to other agents 
(Lieber & DeCarli, 1970; Roberts et al ., 1995; Mastrangelo et al. , 2004). 
GSTs are encoded by a supergene family that is divi ded, on the basis of the chromo-
somal location and sequence homology, into four cla sses; Alpha, Mu, Pi and Theta (Lo & 
Li-Osman, 2007). Approximately half of the Caucasia n population has no GSTM1-1 
enzyme because of a homozygous deletion of the GSTM1  gene. The other half is either 
heterozygous or homozygously normal. The frequency of the GSTM1  null-null genotype 
is similar in Asians but lower in African-Americans  (~ 27%) (Parl, 2005). 
Genotypic differences are also frequent for the GSTT1  gene. The GSTT1 –/– genotype 
is more common in Asians, at frequencies that range fr om 47 to 64%, whereas this homo-
zygous null genotype is found only in 20% of Caucas ians (Parl, 2005). 
There is a structural polymorphism at amino acid position 48 7 of the ALDH2 gene. A 
substitution of lysine for glutamic acid results from a tra nsition of G (allele 1) to A (allele 
2). The ALDH2  alleles that encode the active and inactive subuni ts are termed ALDH2*1  
and ALDH2*2 , respectively (Farres et al. , 1994). The dominant-negative mutant allele, 
ALDH2*2 , is extremely rare in Caucasians, but is widely pr esent in Mongoloids (28–
45%; Goedde et al. , 1992). 
Polymorphisms in genes that encode for the proteins  that are involved in DNA-repair 
processes, such as XRCC1 (X-ray cross-complementing  group 1) and XPD (xeroderma 
pigmentosum group D), may also modulate the occurre nce of vinyl chloride-induced 
mutations. The XRCC1 protein is responsible for the  repair of DNA lesions that are 
caused by alkylating agents. Etheno adducts produce d by vinyl chloride are normally 
removed by the base-excision repair pathway which c ontains several proteins that are 
coordinated by XRCC1. Three polymorphisms have been  identified at codon 194 ( Arg  to 
Trp ), 280 ( Arg  to His ) and 399 at codon 10 ( Arg  to Gln , termed Gln  phenotype) for 
XRCC1 (Lindahl & Wood, 1999; Goode et al. , 2002).  
The XPD protein is an adenosine triphosphate-depend ent 5’-3’ helicase involved in 
nucleotide excision repair. Several polymorphisms h ave also been described for the XPD  
gene (Lindahl & Wood, 1999; Goode et al. , 2002).  
Few studies have investigated vinyl chloride-induce d alterations at the chromosome 
level (sister chromatid exchange) and at the gene l evel ( RAS  and p53  point mutations) in 416 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 vinyl chloride-exposed workers with various polymor phisms. In a study from Taiwan,  
China, CYP2E1c1c2/c2c2, ALDH2 1-2/2-2  and XRCC1 Gln-Gln  polymorphisms 
appeared to be weak susceptibility factors for the frequency of sister chromatid exchange 
in relation to exposure to vinyl chloride, but not GSTT1  or GSTM1  genes (Table 28). 
CYP2E1 c2c2  was also associated with a higher risk for p53 protein overe xpression in the 
plasma of vinyl chloride-exposed workers (adjusted odds ratio, 9.8; 95% CI, 1.2–81.6), 
and this increased risk was also associated with GSTT1  non-null (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 
0.8–7.6) or ALDH2  1-2/2-2 (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.5–4.6), partic ularly in the low-
exposure group ( ≤ 40 ppm–years) (Wong, R.H. et al ., 2002). These authors suggested that 
frequency of sister chromatid exchange reflects rec ent exposure to vinyl chloride, while 
p53  gene mutations reflect cumulative exposure to viny l chloride. However, CYP2E1 
c1/c2 genotype compared with the wild-type c1/c1  genotype appeared to contribute only 
slightly to the occurrence of mutant p21 ras  or p53 proteins in French vinyl chloride-
exposed workers (Li et al. , 2003b).  
In contrast, a joint effect of the XRCC1  codon 399 polymorphism and cumulative 
exposure to vinyl chloride on the occurrence of the  p53 biomarker was observed (Li et al. , 
2003a) . While GSTM1, GSTT1  and GSTP1  polymorphisms were not found to be asso-
ciated with an increased occurrence of mutant p53, a significant trend for the prevalence 
of p53 biomarkers was observed when the combined ef fects of GSTM1, GSTT1 and  
XRCC1 were analysed. The GSTM1  and GSTT1  null genotypes appeared to modify the 
effect of XRCC1  codon 399 genotype on p53 biomarker status, possib ly in a synergistic 
fashion (Table 29) (Li et al ., 2005a). All XRCC1  codon 194, 280 and 399 polymorphisms 
also had an effect on the occurrence of the p53 bio marker (Table 30), but not on that of 
the p21 ras  biomarker in the blood of vinyl chloride-exposed w orkers (Li et al. , 2006). In 
contrast, the mEH genotype has no effect on p21 ras  or p53 biomarkers of vinyl chloride-
induced mutagenic damage and may not be involved as  a major detoxification enzyme in 
the metabolism of vinyl chloride in humans (Li et al.,  2005b). A follow-up of these 
studies has recently reported the analysis of a coh ort of 597 French vinyl chloride-
exposed workers. The presence of biomarkers for mut ant p21 ras  and mutant p53  was 
found to be highly significantly associated with cu mulative exposure to vinyl chloride 
(p for trend < 0.0001). The CYP2E1  variant c2  allele was significantly associated with the 
presence of either or both mutant biomarkers even a fter controlling for potential con-
founders including cumulative exposure to vinyl chl oride (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–
4.1), and the effects of the c2  allele and vinyl chloride exposure were approximat ely 
additive. GSTT1  null status was found to have an increased but not signific ant association 
with the presence of either or both biomarkers afte r controlling for confounders (odds 
ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8–2.0) (Schindler et al ., 2007). 
The effects of polymorphisms of the DNA repair gene  XPD  on DNA damage in 
lymphocytes were studied in vinyl chloride-exposed workers in China using the comet 
assay. The study compared workers with ≥ 5 damaged cells per 100 cells studied with 
workers with no DNA damage who were matched for age , gender, cumulative exposure 
to VCM and worksite. Three XPD  polymorphisms were investigated: Ile199Met , Asp312Asn   VINYL CHLORIDE 417

 and Lys751Gln . Using univariate analysis, it was shown that only  the  XPD751 Lys/Gln 
and  Gln/Gln genotypes were significantly associated with DNA dama ge (odds ratio, 2.21; 
95% CI, 1.01–5.13; p < 0.05). After adjusting for the effects of smokin g, alcoholic 
beverage consumption, liver damage and polymophisms  of the DNA repair gene, and 
using the group with low exposure to vinyl chloride  and the XPD312 Asp/Asp  genotype 
as a reference, it was found that workers with high  exposure and the XPD312 Asp /Asn  
and Asn /Asn  genotypes had a significantly reduced risk for DNA  damage (odds ratio, 
0.33; 95% CI, 0.11–0.95) (Zhu et al ., 2005b).  
These results suggest possible interactions between  polymorphisms in the metabolic 
pathway of vinyl chloride and/or in the DNA repair processes and exposure to vinyl 
chloride that could contribute to the variable susc eptibility to the mutagenic effects of 
vinyl chloride in exposed populations and might she d some light on the mechanism of 
tumour formation in humans. 
4.4.2  Age 
After results were published to indicate that hepat ocytes of young, postnatal rats are 
much more susceptible than those of adult rats to the carci nogenic effect of vinyl chloride 
(Maltoni et al. , 1981; see Section 3), several investigations bega n to characterize the 
potentially susceptible period and the underlying m echanisms. 
Laib et al.  (1985a) investigated the age-dependence of the ind uction of preneoplastic 
enzyme-altered hepatic foci. Male and female Wistar  rats were exposed to 2000 ppm 
[5186 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride either transplacentally or immedia tely (1 day) after birth for 
a period of 5, 11, 17, 47 or 83 days, or from age 7 days or 21 days  until death. Adenosine 
triphosphatase-deficient foci were increased compar ed with control rats after newborn 
exposures of 11 days or more, although foci area di d not further increase after 17 days. 
Transplacental exposure and exposures before day 5 did not increase adenosine triphos-
phatase-deficient foci. 
In accompanying studies, Laib et al . (1985b) also investigated the effects of a range 
of lower concentrations administered early in life.  Wistar rats were exposed to 10, 40, 70, 
150, 500 or 2000 ppm [26, 104, 182, 389, 1300 or 51 86 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride for 
10 weeks beginning at 1 day of age, and Wistar and Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed 
to 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 80 ppm [6.5, 13, 26, 52, 1 04 or 208 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride for 
3 weeks beginning at 3 days of age. In each case, a  linear relationship was observed 
between the concentration of vinyl chloride and the  percentage of foci area induced, with 
no obvious threshold for the induction of preneopla stic foci. 
Ciroussel et al.  (1990) measured the levels of εA and εC adducts in DNA from 
several target organs. Rats were exposed to 500 ppm  [1300 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride for 
2 weeks beginning at 7 days or 13 weeks of age. Bot h εA and εC adducts were detected in 
the liver, lungs and brain (but not kidneys) of rat s that were 7 days old when first exposed. 
In rats that were 13 weeks old when first exposed, only liver DNA was analysed and 
levels of each adduct were one-sixth of those obser ved in the younger rats.  VINYL CHLORIDE 421  
 
 Fedtke et al.  (1990) investigated the formation and persistence of the DNA adducts 
7-OEG and N2,3-εG. Lactating Sprague–Dawley rats and their 10-day-o ld offspring were 
exposed to 600 ppm [1560 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride for 4 h per day for 5 days. In the  neo-
natal rats, concentrations of both DNA adducts were  highest in the liver, followed by 
kidney and lung. No adducts were found in the brain or spleen.  DNA adducts were detec-
ted only in the liver and lung of the dams. Concent rations of DNA adducts in the liver and 
lung were fourfold higher in the neonatal rats than  in the dams. 
Morinello et al.  (2002a) studied the exposure–response relationship  of N2,3-εG 
adducts over a range of dose levels. Adult Sprague- Dawley rats were exposed to 0, 10, 
100 or 1100 ppm [0, 26, 260 or 2852 mg/m 3] vinyl chloride for 1 or 4 weeks, and 
weanlings were similarly exposed for 5 days. The ex posure–response relationship was 
linear from 0 to 100 ppm, then did not increase further. Comp ared with adult rats, two- to 
threefold higher concentrations of N2,3-εG adduct were measured in hepatocytes in the 
weanlings. 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
Vinyl chloride is a gas that is produced predominan tly by breaking down ethylene 
dichloride into smaller molecules. Production of vi nyl chloride by the initial acetylene-
based process is still carried out in China. More than 95% of  vinyl chloride is used for the 
production of polyvinyl chloride resin, which in tu rn is mainly used to produce plastic 
piping and other plastic items. Vinyl chloride is a lso used in the manufacture of chlori-
nated solvents. Production of vinyl chloride monome r is increasing. In 2005, production 
in Asia had outgrown that in both western Europe an d North America. An increasing 
number of workers worldwide are exposed to vinyl ch loride monomer during either its 
production, the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride or pol yvinyl chloride processing. Since 
the late 1970s when the closed-loop polymerization process was introduced, the concen-
trations to which workers are exposed have decrease d substantially in North America and 
western Europe. Levels before that time had been hi gher than 100 mg/m 3. In low- and 
medium-resource countries, older technologies have continued to be used and therefore 
high exposures probably occur. Exposures in polyvin yl chloride processing plants are 
usually considerably lower than those in vinyl chlo ride monomer/polyvinyl chloride 
production; in western Europe and North America, cu rrent exposure levels are generally 
below 1 mg/m 3. Concentrations of vinyl chloride monomer in ambie nt air are normally 
below 0.01 mg/m 3, but higher concentrations have been measured in t he vicinity of vinyl 
chloride/polyvinyl chloride production plants. 422 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 5.2 Cancer in humans  
Epidemiological evidence for the carcinogenicity of  vinyl chloride in humans derives 
principally from two large, multicentric cohort stu dies, one of which was carried out in 
the USA and the other in Europe. These investigatio ns focused on plants that manu-
factured vinyl chloride monomer, polyvinyl chloride  or polyvinyl chloride products. 
Additional information is provided by several small er cohort studies. 
Both of the multicentric cohort studies found a sub stantial increase in the relative risk 
for angiosarcoma of the liver, a tumour that is extremely rar e in the general population, in 
exposed workers. In both studies, the risk for live r angiosarcoma increased strongly with 
duration of exposure to vinyl chloride. In the Euro pean study, there was also a clear trend 
of higher risk with increasing cumulative exposure.  Multiple cases of liver angiosarcoma 
were also reported in two smaller cohort studies. O verall, these findings constitute com-
pelling evidence that vinyl chloride causes angiosa rcoma of the liver. 
Assessment of whether vinyl chloride also causes he patocellular carcinoma is 
complicated because many studies do not have histol ogical or other definitive clinical 
information to discriminate hepatocellular carcinom a from angiosarcoma of the liver 
and/or secondary neoplasms. However, in an internal  analysis of the European multi-
centric cohort, the risk for hepatocellular carcino ma increased significantly and 
substantially with cumulative exposure to vinyl chl oride, based on nine confirmed cases. 
Another analysis of a single Italian plant with exte nded follow-up that was included in the 
European multicentric study included 12 confirmed h epatocellular carcinomas. The 
maximal overlap between these two analyses was four  cases, since only four hepato-
cellular carcinomas from Italy were included in the  multicentric cohort. In this subcohort, 
the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma again inc reased significantly with cumulative 
exposure to vinyl chloride. Together with the observatio n that vinyl chloride increases the 
risk for liver cirrhosis, which is a known risk fac tor for hepatocellular carcinoma, these 
findings provide convincing evidence that vinyl chl oride causes hepatocellular carcinoma 
as well as angiosarcoma of the liver.  
There was suggestive evidence that the risk for hep atocellular carcinoma from vinyl 
chloride is substantially higher among workers who are infected with hepatitis virus or 
report high levels of alcoholic beverage consumptio n. 
Among vinyl chloride workers overall, there was no evidence of an increased risk for 
lung cancer. However, in polyvinyl chloride packers  and baggers, the risk for lung cancer 
increased significantly with cumulative exposure to  vinyl chloride. These workers are 
known to have had concomitant exposure to polyvinyl  chloride dust, and the study did not 
allow attribution of the association to a specific agent or combination of agents.  
Among the other cancer sites, suggestive evidence w as found for malignant neo-
plasms of connective and soft tissue. This derived from the multicentric study in North 
America, in which a nearly threefold statistically significant overall increase in incidence 
was observed that persisted after the exclusion of four angiosarcomas for which the site 
was unknown. The risk was higher for workers with l onger duration of employment  VINYL CHLORIDE 423  
 
 (i.e. 10–19 and ≥ 20 years). These findings were not supported by th e European multi-
centric study, in which too few cases of connective  tissue neoplasms were observed for an 
evaluation of exposure–response. 
The Working Group did not find strong epidemiologic al evidence for associations of 
exposure to vinyl chloride with cancers of the brai n or lymphatic and haematopoeitic 
tissue or melanoma. Although the associations found  for these cancers in specific studies 
may reflect true increases in risk, the findings we re inconsistent between studies, no clear 
exposure–response relationships were found in the E uropean multicentric study and, for 
several of the sites, the numbers of observed and e xpected cases were small. No conclu-
sion could be reached for breast cancer since the s tudies included too few women.    
5.3 Cancer in experimental animals 
The carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride has been stud ied intensively and repeatedly in 
experimental animals. The numerous studies are gene rally mutually reinforced. This 
wealth of data has generally been incompletely repo rted, however, and the outcomes of 
many experiments in the published studies are avail able only from summary tables, in 
which technical details are given only as footnotes . 
Vinyl chloride was tested by inhalation exposure in  seven studies in mice, in nine 
studies in rats and in two studies in hamsters. Male and femal e animals were treated in all 
three species, although some experiments were carrie d out only in one sex. Vinyl chloride 
induced hepatic angiosarcomas in three studies in m ice and in eight studies in rats; a 
positive dose–response was observed for hepatic ang iosarcomas in mice and rats over a 
wide range of exposures. It induced angiosarcomas ( all sites) in four studies in mice, in 
three studies in rats and in one study in hamsters.  Extrahepatic angiosarcomas related to 
treatment with vinyl chloride were observed in thre e studies in mice and two studies in 
rats. Vinyl chloride increased the incidence of mam mary tumours in six studies in mice, 
in three studies in rats and in one study in hamste rs. Exposure to vinyl chloride increased 
the incidence of skin tumours in one study in rats and in two studies in hamsters, and 
increased the incidence of Zymbal gland carcinomas in four studies in rats, with a dose–
response pattern in one experiment. Vinyl chloride increased the incidence of lung 
tumours in six studies in mice, induced renal tumou rs and tumours of the nasal cavity in 
one study in rats, increased the incidence of hepat ocellular carcinomas in two studies in 
rats and increased the incidence of glandular stoma ch tumours in one study in hamsters. 
In one study in rats, combined oral administration of ethanol and inhalation exposure 
to vinyl chloride caused more liver tumours (includ ing angiosarcomas and hepatocellular 
carcinomas) than exposure to vinyl chloride alone.  
Vinyl chloride was tested by oral administration in  four studies in male and female 
rats. It induced hepatic angiosarcomas in all studi es, extrahepatic angiosarcomas in one 
study and hepatocellular carcinomas in two studies.  When vinyl chloride was tested by 
subcutaneous injection and by intraperitoneal injection i n single studies in rats, no hepatic 
angiosarcomas were induced.  424 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 The transplacental carcinogenicity of vinyl chlorid e was evaluated in one study in the 
offspring of rats exposed by inhalation during preg nancy. A low but significant incidence 
of tumours was observed in exposed offspring at sit es that included the kidney, Zymbal 
gland and several others. However, no angiosarcomas  or liver-cell tumours developed in 
the offspring.  
Vinyl chloride was tested by perinatal inhalation e xposure in two studies in rats. In 
one study, rats were exposed transplacentally, neon atally and during adulthood. Treat-
ment with vinyl chloride induced hepatic angiosarco mas and hepatocellular carcinomas. 
Rats also demonstrated high incidences of tumours that wer e probably of olfactory neuro-
epithelial origin, but which were formerly reported  as cerebral neuroblastomas in some 
studies. In a second study, rats were exposed to vinyl chlor ide for 5 weeks only beginning 
at birth. Hepatic angiosarcomas and ‘hepatomas’ occ urred at a high incidence in the off-
spring, but not in the dams that were co-exposed wi th the offspring.  
Chloroethylene oxide, a chemically reactive metabol ite of vinyl chloride, was tested 
for carcinogenicity in a single study in mice by su bcutaneous injection and in an initiation–
promotion protocol on the skin. It caused fibrosarc omas at the site of subcutaneous injec-
tion and increased the incidence of squamous-cell p apillomas and carcinomas of the skin 
at the site of application. 
5.4 Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Pulmonary absorption of vinyl chloride in humans ap pears to be rapid, and the 
percentage that is absorbed (about 40%) is independ ent of the concentration inhaled. 
Vinyl chloride is oxidized to highly reactive chlor oethylene oxide, which rearranges to 
chloroacetaldehyde. The initial oxidation is predom inantly mediated by cytochrome P450 
2E1, an enzyme that is induced by ethanol among oth er agents. In rats, the metabolism of 
vinyl chloride is saturable at an inhalation concen tration of 250 ppm [ ∼650 mg/m 3], at 
which the incidence of hepatic angiosarcoma in thes e animals has been reported to 
plateau. The rate of vinyl chloride metabolism in h umans is approximately 50 µmol/h/kg. 
The rate of elimination of vinyl chloride does not appear to be altered during repeated 
compared with single inhalation exposures. 
Following metabolic activation of vinyl chloride in  rats, the two metabolites, chloro-
ethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde, react with n ucleic acid bases to form adducts. 
These include the major adduct N7-(2-oxoethyl)guanine, four etheno adducts and 
5,6,7,9-tetrahydro-7-hydroxy-9-oxoimidazol[1,2- a]purine, as identified in vitro and in rats 
in vivo . In rats exposed to vinyl chloride, increased leve ls of etheno adducts have been 
found in different organs, such as the liver, lung and kidney, and in lymphocytes but not 
in the brain. Young animals are particularly prone to the formation and persistence of 
vinyl chloride-induced adducts. In rats, adducts ha ve been found equally in non-paren-
chymal liver cells and in hepatocytes. In humans, e theno adducts are formed by lipid per-
oxidation; there is, however, a paucity of data on the occurrence of such adducts in vinyl  VINYL CHLORIDE 425  
 
 chloride-exposed humans. The mechanism that leads t o base misincorporation following 
adduct formation is still unclear. 
Vinyl chloride is mutagenic, usually in the presenc e of metabolic activation, in 
various assays with bacteria, yeast or mammalian ce lls and is clastogenic in in-vivo and 
in-vitro systems. It induces unscheduled DNA synthe sis and increases the frequency of 
sister chromatid exchange in rat and human cells. E xposure to vinyl chloride has been 
associated with an increase in the frequency of chr omosomal aberrations, micronucleus 
formation and sister chromatid exchange in humans. 
Ki-ras  gene mutations are associated with vinyl chloride- induced angiosarcoma in 
humans but not in rats. In half of the cases, Ki- ras  mutations lead to the incorporation of 
aspartate instead of glycine. Ki- ras  mutations were also found to a lesser extend in vi nyl-
chloride induced hepatocellular carcinomas. A speci fic Ha-ras  gene mutation (CAA61CTA) 
was found vinyl chloride-induced hepatocarcinomas i n rats. A mutated p53  gene was 
found in approximately half of the angiosarcomas in  humans and rats that resulted from 
exposure to vinyl chloride. The p53  mutations in both species are often due to A →T 
transversions. 
The presence of mutated p21 ras  and p53 proteins in the blood of a high proportion  of 
workers exposed to vinyl chloride and the positive correlation between the occurrence of 
the mutated proteins and cumulative exposure to vin yl chloride suggest that the mutation 
is an early event. 
In humans, genetic polymorphisms in genes that enco de the enzymes involved in the 
metabolism of vinyl chloride ( CYP2E1 , GSTT1 , GSTM1 , ALDH2 ) and in DNA repair 
(XRCC1 ) modulate the DNA damage induced by vinyl chloride . 
6. Evaluation and Rationale 
6.1 Carcinogenicity in humans 
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride. Vinyl  
chloride causes angiosarcomas of the liver and hepa tocellular carcinomas.  
6.2 Carcinogenicity in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of  vinyl 
chloride. 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of  
chloroethylene oxide.

–445– VINYL BROMIDE 
This substance was considered by previous Working G roups in February 1978 
(IARC, 1979), June 1985 (IARC, 1986), March 1987 (I ARC, 1987) and February 1998 
(IARC, 1999). Since that time, new data have become  available, and these have been 
incorporated into the monograph and taken into cons ideration in the present evaluation.

1.1.4  Technical impurities 
According to Ethyl Corporation (1980), hydroquinone  methyl ether is used as an 
inhibitor (175–225 mg/kg) in vinyl bromide. Water ( max. 100 mg/kg) and non-volatile 
matter (max. 500 mg/kg including the inhibitor) rep resent the major impurities. 
1.1.5  Analysis 
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( 1979) in the USA has 
developed a method (OSHA Method 8) to measure vinyl  bromide with a detection limit 
of 0.2 ppm. 
1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
Vinyl bromide can be produced by the catalytic addi tion of hydrogen bromide to 
acetylene in the presence of mercury and copper hal ide catalysts or by partial dehydro-
bromination of ethylene dibromide with alcoholic po tassium hydroxide (Ramey & Lini, 
1971). 
The Hazardous Substance Database indicated only one  manufacturer of vinyl 
bromide in the USA in 2002 (National Toxicology Pro gram, 2005). One plant in China 
reported a production capacity of 500 million tonne s per year in 2006 (Loyal Gain, 2006).

pressure (101.3 kPa)  VINYL BROMIDE 447  
 
 1.2.2  Use 
According to a notice in the Federal Register (Anon ., 2002), vinyl bromide has been 
used predominantly in polymers in the production of  fabrics and fabric blends that are 
used in nightwear (mostly for children) and home fu rnishings, in leather and fabricated 
metal products and in the production of pharmaceuti cals and fumigants. Current 
applications of vinyl bromide include its use as an  intermediate in the synthesis of 
pharmaceutical products, as a component of fire ext inguishers in blends with compounds 
that contain fluorine, as a monomer in the formatio n of copolymers that possess flame-
retardant properties and as a starting material for  the preparation of vinylmagnesium 
bromide, which is a component of variety of other p olymers (Far Research, 2000). 
According to the Chinese manufacturer Loyal Gain (2 006), vinyl bromide is also used in 
the pharmaceutical industry in the production of the coenz yme Q 10  and in the synthesis of 
organic bromo compounds. 
1.3 Occurrence  
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
Vinyl bromide is not known to occur naturally in th e environment. 
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
Vinyl bromide has been available commercially since  1968. Occupational exposure 
may occur during the production of vinyl bromide an d its polymers. According to the 
1981–83 National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES , 2002), approximately 1822 
workers in the USA were potentially exposed to viny l bromide (see General Remarks). 
Exposure to vinyl bromide was considered by CAREX b ut did not yield many exposed 
individuals (Kauppinen et al. , 2000). Other estimates of the number of workers e xposed 
to vinyl bromide in Europe are available only from the Finnish Register of Occupational 
Exposure to Carcinogens which reported one individu al who was notified as having been 
exposed to vinyl bromide in 2004 (Saalo et al ., 2006).  
Median 8-h time-weighted average exposures at a vin yl bromide manufacturing plant 
ranged from 0.4 to 27.5 mg/m 3, depending on the job and area surveyed. Personal air 
samples showed that a plant operator was exposed to  0.4–1.7 mg/m 3, a laboratory tech-
nician to 1.3–2.2 mg/m 3 and two loading crewmen to 5.2 and 27.5 (1-h sampl es) mg/m 3 
(Bales, 1978; Oser, 1980). 
1.3.3  Environmental occurrence 
Vinyl bromide may form in the air as a degradation product of 1,2-dibromoethane 
(IARC, 1999). It may also be released into the envi ronment from facilities that manu-448 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 facture or use vinyl bromide as a flame retardant f or acrylic fibres. Vinyl bromide has 
been qualitatively identified in ambient air sample s (National Library of Medicine, 1998). 
1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
No international guidelines for vinyl bromide in drinking- water have been established 
(WHO, 2006). Many countries, regions or organizatio ns have established guideline values 
for vinyl bromide in the workplace (Table 1).

The United Nations Committee on Transport of Danger ous Goods had classified 
vinyl bromide as Hazard class 2.1. (IPCS-CEC, 2002;  UNTDG, 2005). 
The classification expert group of the European Uni on (REACH) classified vinyl 
bromide as F+ (extremely flammable), T (toxic), wit h R (risk) phrases of 45 (causes  VINYL BROMIDE 449  
 
 cancer) and 12 (extremely flammable) and S (safety)  phrases of  53 (avoid exposure) and 
45 (show label where possible; if you feel unwell, seek medical advice) (IPCS-CEC, 
2002; ECB, 2004).

of age, were exposed by inhalation to approximately  44, 220, 1100 or 5500 mg/m 3 ± 5% 
[10, 50, 250 or 1250 ppm ± 5%] vinyl bromide (purity ≥ 99.9%) for 6 h per day on 5 days 
per week for 104 weeks. A group of 144 males and 14 4 females served as untreated 
controls. The animals in the highest-dose group wer e killed at 72 weeks because of 50–
60% mortality. Statistical significance was assesse d by the χ2 test. Tumour incidences in 
rats exposed to vinyl bromide are summarized in Tab le 2. Treatment-related increases in 
the incidence of liver angiosarcomas were observed in all exposed groups: males — 
0/144 controls, 7/120 at 10 ppm ( p < 0.025), 36/120 at 50 ppm ( p < 0.001), 61/120 at 250 
ppm ( p < 0.001) and 43/120 at 1250 ppm ( p < 0.001); females — 1/144, 10/120, 50/120, 
61/120 and 41/120, respectively ( p < 0.01 for all exposed groups). An increased incide nce 
of Zymbal gland squamous-cell carcinomas also occur red in both sexes of exposed rats: 
males — 2/142 controls, 1/99 at 10 ppm, 1/112 at 50 ppm, 13/114 at 250 ppm ( p < 0.005) 
and 35/116 at 1250 ppm ( p < 0.005); females — 0/139, 0/99, 3/113, 2/119 and 11/114 ( p 
< 0.001), respectively. Hepatic neoplastic nodules [hepatocellular adenomas] and 
hepatocellular carcinomas were also observed, the i ncidence of which was significantly 
increased in some but not all treatment groups. The  incidence of benign and malignant 
hepatocellular liver tumours combined as 4/143 cont rol, and 5/103, 10/119, 13/120 ( p < 
0.025) and 5/119 males treated with successively hi gher exposure levels; and 7/142 
control, and 18/101 ( p < 0.005), 12/113, 21/118 ( p < 0.005) and 9/112 females, 
respectively. Failure of the highest dose to increa se the incidence of hepatocellular 
tumours was most probably a consequence of the redu ced survival and early termination 
of these animals. No exposure-related increased inc idence of brain tumours was observed 
(Benya et al ., 1982).

3.2 Dermal exposure 
Mouse 
A group of 30 female ICR/Ha Swiss mice [age unspeci fied] received dermal 
applications of 15 mg vinyl bromide [purity unspecif ied] in 0.1 mL acetone three times a 
week for 60 weeks. No skin tumours were observed. I n a two-stage skin carcinogenesis 
study, groups of 30 female ICR/Ha Swiss mice received a  single dermal application of 15 
mg vinyl bromide in 0.1 mL acetone, followed by thr ice-weekly applications of 2.5 µg of 
12-O- tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 0.1 mL aceto ne for 60 weeks. Additional 
groups of mice received TPA alone or no treatment. One of 30 mice treated with vinyl 
bromide followed by TPA had a skin papilloma at 412  days, and one of 30 mice treated 
with TPA alone had a skin carcinoma at 44 days. No tumours were found in 160  VINYL BROMIDE 451  
 
 untreated mice. Systemic carcinogenesis was not ass essed (Van Duuren, 1977). [The 
Working Group noted that the volatility of vinyl br omide would have led to very low 
doses in these studies of dermal application.] 
3.3 Subcutaneous administration 
Mouse 
Groups of 30 female ICR/Ha Swiss mice [age unspecif ied] received weekly 
subcutaneous injections of 0 or 25 mg vinyl bromide  [purity unspecified] in 0.05 mL 
trioctanoin for 48 weeks and were observed for up t o 420 days. No tumours were reported 
in vinyl bromide-treated mice or in vehicle or in 6 0 untreated controls. Systemic 
carcinogenesis was not assessed (Van Duuren, 1977).  
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data  
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
4.1.1  Humans 
No data were available to the Working Group. 
4.1.2  Experimental systems 
The limited available data on absorption, distribut ion, metabolism and excretion of 
vinyl bromide in experimental systems have been rev iewed previously (IARC, 1986, 
1999). The following section summarizes the salient  features of the studies that were 
reviewed at that time, as well as significant new i nformation on the metabolism and 
pharmacokinetics of vinyl bromide in experimental a nimals. 
Vinyl bromide is readily absorbed upon inhalation b y rats (IARC, 1986). The 
blood:air partition coefficient of vinyl bromide in  rats is 4.05, which is about 2.5-fold and 
fivefold greater than the values for vinyl chloride  and vinyl fluoride, respectively 
(Cantoreggi & Keller, 1997). Similarly, the tissue solubility (particularly the affinity for 
adipose tissues) and the volume of distribution of vinyl b romide are greater than those for 
vinyl chloride and vinyl fluoride (Cantoreggi & Kel ler, 1997). 
Vinyl bromide is metabolized in a similar manner to vi nyl chloride and vinyl fluoride, 
and it is a substrate for human cytochrome P450 (CY P) 2E1. Guengerich et al . (1991) 
reported that the rate of metabolism of vinyl bromi de was identical to that of vinyl 
chloride (0.027 nmol/min.nmol CYP), using purified human liver CYP2E1. In this study, 
the in-vitro formation of 1, N6-ethenoadenosine that resulted from bromoethylene o xide 
was also demonstrated (Guengerich et al ., 1991). Bromoethylene oxide can be 452 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 deactivated by epoxide hydrolase and glutathione- S-transferases, or can re-arrange to 
bromoacetaldehyde (National Toxicology Program, 199 9). 
The metabolism of vinyl bromide in rats is saturabl e at exposure concentrations 
greater than 235 mg/m 3 [55 ppm] (Filser & Bolt, 1979). Following inhalati on of vinyl 
bromide by rats, rabbits and monkeys, plasma levels  of non-volatile bromide increased 
with duration of exposure, and were formed more rap idly in hepatic CYP-induced rats 
(IARC, 1986). 
In rats, the conversion of vinyl bromide to reactiv e metabolites occurs primarily in 
hepatocytes. Irreversible binding of such metabolit es to proteins and RNA has been 
established with rat liver microsomes in vitro as well as in rats in  vivo  (Bolt et al ., 1980). 
These metabolites can also alkylate the CYP prosthe tic group of phenobarbital-treated rat 
liver microsomes. Further, the exposure of rats to high concentrations of vinyl bromide 
has been shown to cause a decrease in hepatic CYP ( IARC, 1986).  
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  Humans 
No data were available to the Working Group. 
4.2.2 Experimental systems 
(a) DNA adducts 
Vinyl bromide metabolites bind covalently to DNA an d proteins; 2-bromoethylene 
oxide is the major DNA-binding moiety and 2-bromoac etaldehyde is the major protein-
binding metabolite (Guengerich et al ., 1981). The major adduct that results from exposur e 
to vinyl bromide is N-7-(2-oxoethyl)guanosine (Bolt et al ., 1981). Bromoacetaldehyde 
and bromoethylene oxide can react with adenine or c ytosine bases to produce the cyclic 
etheno adducts 1, N6-ethenoadenosine and 3, N4-ethenocytosine, which can cause mis-
coding by modifying base-pairing sites (Bolt, 1988).  Cyclic etheno adducts have a longer 
half-life than N-7-(2-oxoethyl)guanine and, therefore, may have a g reater potential to 
accumulate with long-term exposure (Swenberg et al. , 1992). 
(b) Mutations and other related effects 
Vinyl bromide has been shown to be mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  (Lijinsky 
& Andrews, 1980) and in a recessive lethal mutation  test with post-meiotic male germ 
cells of Drosophila melanogaster  (Ballering et al . 1996). Two GC →AT transitions, five 
GC →TA and four AT →TA transversions were observed (Ballering et al ., 1997; Nivard 
& Vogel, 1999). 
The comet assay was used to assess the genotoxicity of vinyl b romide in the stomach, 
liver, kidney, bladder, lung, brain and bone marrow  of male CD-1 mice. The compound  VINYL BROMIDE 453  
 
 (at 2000 mg/kg bw) induced statistically significant DNA d amage in all organs except the 
bone marrow (Sasaki et al ., 1998).  
4.3 Mechanisms of carcinogenesis 
The metabolism of vinyl bromide is similar to that of vinyl chloride and vinyl 
fluoride. Vinyl bromide is metabolized to bromoethy lene oxide and bromoacetaldehyde 
by human CYP2E1. In-vitro studies have shown that t hese intermediates, in the presence 
of adenosine, form 1, N6-ethenoadenosine. The same promutagenic adduct is f ormed with 
chloroethylene oxide, the primary intermediate of v inyl chloride metabolism. It is one of 
the adducts that are implicated in the mutagenicity  and carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride. 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
Vinyl bromide is a flammable gas that is produced i n a limited number of countries. It 
is used predominantly for the manufacture of polyvi nyl bromide and to a smaller extent as 
a flame retardant in a large variety of industrial and consumer products. Workers may be 
exposed during the manufacture of vinyl bromide mon omer and during production of the 
polymer. 
5.2 Cancer in humans 
No data were available to the Working Group.  
5.3 Cancer in experimental animals 
In a study of inhalation exposure in both sexes of rats, vinyl bromide caused a 
significant increase in the incidence of angiosarco mas of the liver, hepatocellular 
adenomas and carcinomas, and squamous-cell carcinom as of the Zymbal gland.  
In limited studies in female mice, vinyl bromide ne ither induced nor initiated skin 
tumours after dermal application and did not cause injection-site tumours after repeated 
subcutaneous injection.  
5.4  Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Vinyl bromide is readily absorbed upon inhalation. It is a substrate for human 
cytochrome P450 2E1 and is metabolized by this enzy me in a manner similar to that of 454 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 vinyl chloride and vinyl fluoride. A study in rats has shown that the metabolism of vinyl 
bromide is saturable at exposure concentrations gre ater than 55 ppm ( ∼240 mg/m 3). 
Bromoethylene oxide and bromoacetaldehyde are known  metabolites of vinyl 
bromide that can form DNA adducts that are similar to those formed by metabolites of 
vinyl chloride. These include N7-(2-oxoethyl)guanosine (the major adduct) and the cycl ic 
adducts, ethenodeoxyadenosine and ethenodeoxycytidi ne, which can cause miscoding by 
modifying base-pairing sites. Vinyl bromide caused DNA dam age in mice treated in vivo , 
and has been shown to be mutagenic in bacteria and in Drosophila . 
6. Evaluation and Rationale 
6.1 Carcinogenicity in humans 
There is inadequate evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of vinyl bromide . 
6.2 Carcinogenicity in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of  vinyl 
bromide. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
Vinyl bromide is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A) . 
6.4 Rationale 
In making the overall evaluation, the Working Group  took into consideration the fact 
that all available studies showed a consistently pa rallel response between vinyl bromide 
and vinyl chloride. In addition, both vinyl chlorid e and vinyl bromide are activated via a 
human cytochrome P450 2E1-dependent pathway to thei r corresponding epoxides. For 
both vinyl chloride and vinyl bromide, the covalent  binding of these compounds to 
nucleosides/DNA yields pro-mutagenic etheno adducts . The weight of positive evidence 
for both compounds was also noted among the studies  for genotoxicity, although the 
number and variety of tests for vinyl bromide were fewer. For practical purposes, vinyl 
bromide should be considered to act similarly to th e human carcinogen, vinyl chloride.  VINYL BROMIDE 455

 1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
Vinyl fluoride was first prepared by the reaction o f 1,1-difluoro-2-bromoethane with 
zinc. Most approaches to vinyl fluoride synthesis h ave employed reactions of acetylene 
with hydrogen fluoride either directly or utilizing  catalysts. Other routes have involved 
ethylene and hydrogen fluoride, pyrolysis of 1,1-di fluoroethane and fluorochloroethanes, 
reaction of 1,1-difluoroethane with acetylene and h alogen exchange of vinyl chloride with 
hydrogen fluoride (Siegmund et al. , 1988; Ebnesajjad, 2001). 
Use of vinyl fluoride in the Member States of the E uropean Union in 1991 was 
estimated to be about 3600 tonnes (Environmental Ch emicals Data and Information 
Network, 1993). In 1994, vinyl fluoride was produced by on e company each in Japan and 
the USA (Chemical Information Services, 1994). Annu al production in the USA was 
above one million pounds [454 000 kg] in 1990 and a pproximately 3.3 millions pounds 
[1.5 million kg] in 2001 (National Toxicology Progr am, 2005).  
1.2.2  Use 
Since the 1960s, vinyl fluoride has mainly been use d in the production of polyvinyl 
fluoride (PVF) and other fluoropolymers. PVF homopo lymers and copolymers have 
excellent resistance to degradation by sunlight, ch emical attack, water absorption and 
solvents, and have a high solar energy transmittanc e rate. These properties have resulted 
in the utilization of PVF film and coating in outdoor and indo or functional and decorative 
applications. These films have found use where thermal s tability, outdoor durability, stain 
resistance, adherence and release properties are re quired (Ebnesajjad, 2001). 
PVF is converted to a thin film by plasticized melt  extrusion and is sold under the 
trade marks Tedlar PVF film and Dalvor. The growing  market for solar panels has 
increased the demand for photovoltaic materials suc h as Tedlar and has forced the manu-
facturer to boost its production of vinyl fluoride (Dupont, 2007).  
1.3 Occurrence 
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
Vinyl fluoride is not known to occur as a natural p roduct.  
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
No estimates of the number of workers exposed to vi nyl fluoride are available. 
The concentration of vinyl fluoride in air was dete rmined at a manufacturing and at a 
polymerization plant in the USA. The concentrations  in eight samples taken at the 
manufacturing plant were generally < 2 ppm [3.76 mg /m 3], but a level of 21 ppm 462 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 [39.5 mg/m 3] was reported in one personal sample. The concentr ations in seven personal 
samples taken in the polymerization plant were 1–4 ppm [1.88–7.52 mg/m 3] and those in 
four general area samples were 1–5 ppm [1.88–9.4 mg /m 3] (Oser, 1980). 
1.3.3  Environmental exposure 
No data were available to the Working Group on envi ronmental exposure to vinyl 
fluoride.

3.1 Inhalation exposure 
3.1.1  Mouse 
Groups of 80 or 81 male and 80 or 81 female Crl:CD-1(ICR)BR m ice, approximately 
47 days of age, were exposed by inhalation to 0, 25 , 250 or 2500 ppm [0, 47, 470 or 
4700 mg/m 3] vinyl fluoride (purity > 99.94%) for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for up 
to 18 months. Animals in the 250- and 2500-ppm groups were ki lled when survival of the 
groups reached approximately 25% (after 375 and 450  days for high-dose males and 
females and 412 and 459 days for mid-dose males and  females, respectively). Surviving 
control and low-dose mice of each sex were killed a t the scheduled termination of the 
study at 18 months. The survival rates for the control and l ow-dose groups were 58% and 
22%, respectively, for both sexes. All organs of co ntrol and high-dose animals were 
examined microscopically; only nose, lungs, liver, kidneys, gross lesions and target 
organs of animals in all other groups underwent mic roscopic evaluation. The mice were 
evaluated after necropsy at intervals of 0–6 and 7– 18 months. Statistical analyses of the 
overall tumour incidence were not conducted because  of the varying durations of ex-
posure to vinyl fluoride. An early, significant inc rease in the incidence of lung tumours 
(bronchioalveolar adenomas) was observed in males i n the 250- and 2500-ppm groups 
and in females in the 2500-ppm group that were killed  at 6 months ( p < 0.05). The overall 
incidence of primary lung tumours (alveolar-bronchi olar adenomas and adeno-
carcinomas) in males was 11/81 controls, 45/80 at 25  ppm, 52/80 at 250 ppm and 56/81 at 
2500 ppm and that in females was 9/81 (controls), 2 4/80 at 25 ppm, 47/80 at 250 ppm and 
53/81 at 2500 ppm. Hepatic angiosarcomas occurred i n 1/81 control, 16/80 low-dose, 
42/80 mid-dose and 42/81 high-dose males and in 0/8 1 control, 13/81 low-dose, 25/80 
mid-dose and 32/81 high-dose females. Mammary gland  adenocarcinomas were seen 
only in female mice that were necropsied between 7 and 18 months of observation and 
occurred in 0/62 controls and 22/60, 20/65 and 19/6 4 animals exposed to 25, 250 and 
250 ppm, respectively. Two fibroadenomas and one ma mmary adenoma also occurred in 
the high-dose group. The incidence of Harderian gla nd adenomas was increased in both 
sexes of exposed animals that survived beyond 6 mon ths. The incidence in males was 
3/66 controls and 13/68, 12/66 and 31/62 mice expos ed to 25, 250 and 2500 ppm, 
respectively; in females, the incidence was 1/64 co ntrols and 7/61, 6/66 and 12/66 mice 
exposed to increasing concentrations of vinyl fluoride, re spectively. No carcinomas of the 
Harderian gland were seen. The overall (aggregate) incidence of tumours in the lungs, 
liver (haemangiosarcomas and hepatocellular tumours ), Harderian gland and mammary 
gland is summarized in Table 2. Although the incide nce of hepatocellular adenomas was 
not dose-dependent, the decreased tumour latency, i ncreased multiplicity and associated 
increase in putatively preneoplastic basophilic foc i led to the conclusion that the tumours 464 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 observed in males in the 25 ppm-treated group were related to exposure to vinyl fluoride 
(Bogdanffy et al ., 1995).

3.1.2  Rat 
Groups of 95 male and 95 female Sprague-Dawley (Crl :CD ®BR) rats, approximately 
40 days of age, were exposed by inhalation to 0, 25 , 250 or 2500 ppm [0, 47, 470 or 
4700 mg/m 3] vinyl fluoride (purity > 99.94%) for 6 h per day on 5 days per week for up 
to 2 years. Ten rats per group were killed on test days 275 and 276 for interim 
examination. Because of high mortality, rats in the  250- and 2500-ppm groups were killed 
when the percentage of surviving animals in each gr oup reached approximately 25% 
(657 days and 586 days for all surviving animals in  the 250-and 2500-ppm groups, 
respectively). All surviving control and low-dose a nimals were killed at the scheduled 
termination of the study (2 years). The survival ra tes for control and low-dose groups at  VINYL FLUORIDE 465  
 
 the end of the study were 25% and 20% (males) and 2 5% and 15% (females), respec-
tively. The rats were evaluated after necropsy at i ntervals of 0–12, 13–18 and 19–24 
months. Statistical analyses of the overall tumour incidence were not conducted because 
of the varying durations of exposure to vinyl fluor ide. An early appearance of liver and 
Zymbal gland tumours was observed at the 12-month e valuation. Exposure of the rats to 
vinyl fluoride for up to 2 years caused an increase in the incidence of haemangiosarcomas 
of the liver and Zymbal gland carcinomas in males a nd females and hepatocellular 
adenomas and carcinomas in females. The overall incidence o f tumours in rats exposed to 
vinyl fluoride for up to 2 years is summarized in T able 3 (Bogdanffy et al ., 1995).

4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
4.1.1  Humans 
No data were available to the Working Group. 466 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 4.1.2  Experimental systems 
The limited available data on the absorption, distr ibution, metabolism and excretion 
of vinyl fluoride in experimental systems have been  reviewed previously (IARC, 1995). 
The following section summarizes the salient featur es of the studies reviewed at that time, 
as well as significant new information on the metab olism and pharmacokinetics of vinyl 
fluoride in experimental animals. 
Vinyl fluoride is readily absorbed after inhalation  (Filser & Bolt, 1979, 1981). The 
very low solubility of vinyl fluoride in tissues an d blood suggests that it rapidly 
equilibrates within the body during inhalation expo sures. The low blood:air and tissue:air 
partition coefficients (0.54–1.82 in rats) indicate  a low volume of distribution for vinyl 
fluoride. Moreover, a fat:blood partition coefficie nt of 2.4 for this chemical indicates that 
it is unlikely to be stored to a significant extent  in the adipose tissues (Cantoreggi & 
Keller, 1997).  
The metabolic pathways of vinyl fluoride are though t to be similar to those of vinyl 
chloride and vinyl bromide (National Toxicology Prog ram, 1999). The initial oxidation of 
vinyl fluoride results in the formation of fluoroet hylene oxide and is probably mediated 
by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1, as indicated by the in hibition of the metabolism of vinyl 
fluoride by 4-methylpyrazole (Cantoreggi & Keller, 1997). Vinyl fluoride, similarly to 
vinyl chloride, is shown to mediate in-vitro nicotinamide  adenine dinucleotide phosphate-
dependent inactivation of CYP (Ortiz de Montellano et al ., 1982). 
In-vitro studies with human liver microsomes indica ted that the apparent affinity for 
the metabolism of vinyl fluoride (Michaelis-Menten constant, 0.5 µM) and the maximum 
velocity (0.57–3.3 nmol/h/mg protein) were in the s ame range as those found in rodents 
(Cantoreggi & Keller 1997). However, considerable i nterindividual variation in maxi-
mum velocity (sixfold) was observed in 10 human sam ples (Cantoreggi & Keller,1997). 
The saturation of vinyl fluoride metabolism occurs at about 75 ppm [143 mg/m 3] in 
rats (Filser & Bolt, 1979). Both in-vitro and in-vi vo metabolism studies indicated that the 
rate of metabolism of vinyl fluoride is about three  times greater in mice than in rats (3.5 
versus 1.1 nmol/h/mg protein) (Cantoreggi & Keller,  1997). Pharmacokinetic data also 
indicate that the rate of biotransformation of vinyl  fluoride in rats is about one-fifth that of 
vinyl chloride (Filser & Bolt, 1979). Administratio n of vinyl fluoride to rats results in 
increased exhalation of acetone, which implies an i nhibition of Krebs cycle by the 
fluoroacetate that results from vinyl fluoride meta bolism (Filser et al ., 1982).  
Fluoride appears to be a metabolite of vinyl fluori de since it is found in the urine of 
rats 6 days after exposure. The concentrations of f luoride in the urine of rats were found 
to be increased 45 and 90 days after exposure by in halation to 200 or 2000 ppm [382 or 
3820 mg/m 3] vinyl fluoride for 6 h per day on 5 days per week  for about 90 days. A 
plateau was observed at about 2000 ppm [3820 mg/m 3], which suggests saturation of 
vinyl fluoride metabolism (Bogdanffy et al ., 1990). When rats and mice were exposed to 
0, 25, 250 or 2500 ppm [0, 47, 470 or 4700 mg/m 3] vinyl fluoride for 18 months, a 
plateau of urinary excretion of fluoride was seen a t ≥ 250 ppm (Bogdanffy et al ., 1995).  VINYL FLUORIDE 467  
 
 4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  Humans 
No data were available to the Working Group. 
4.2.1  Experimental systems 
(a) DNA adducts 
Vinyl fluoride metabolites form covalent DNA adduct s that are similar to those 
formed by metabolites of vinyl chloride. These incl ude N7-(2 ′-oxoethyl)guanine 
(7-OEG), N2,3-ethenoguanine ( N2,3-εG), 1, N 6-ethenoadenine and 3, N 4-ethenocytosine. 
Target cell populations for angiosarcomas in vinyl fluoride-exposed rats are non-
parenchymal cells, which contain more N2,3-εG than hepatocytes and have lower 
expression of the associated DNA-repair enzyme N-methylpurine–DNA glycosylase 
(Swenberg et al ., 1999; Holt et al ., 2000). Other vinyl fluoride-induced DNA adducts 
were not measured in these animals. 
During a 2-year study, rats and mice were exposed by wh ole-body inhalation to 0, 25, 
250 or 2500 ppm [0, 47, 470 or 4700 mg/m 3] vinyl fluoride for 6 h per day on 5 days per 
week. Tissues were collected after 12 months for de tection of 7-OEG and εG adducts in 
liver DNA. Similarly to vinyl chloride, a supraline ar response was observed for εG as 
well as 7-OEG due to saturation of metabolic activa tion. The number of 7-OEG adducts 
in preweanling rats was two to three times greater than that in adults. Exposure for 
12 months to 25 ppm vinyl fluoride caused a 2.5-fol d increase in εG in mice and a 
3.5-fold increase in rats compared with controls. In  mice, a linear relationship between the 
incidence of angiosarcomas and the number of εG adducts was observed, while rats 
showed a sublinear relationship between 250 and 250 0 ppm due to an increase in cell 
proliferation. Hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cell s were isolated: non-parenchymal 
cells contain little or no CYP2E1; however, after 4  weeks of exposure, non-parenchymal 
cells contained 1.2 ± 0.9 pmol εG/ µmol guanine while hepatocytes contained 0.4 pmol 
εG/ µmol guanine which was due to a lower expression of N-methylpurine–DNA 
glycosylase (a DNA-repair enzyme) in non-parenchyma l cells (Swenberg et al ., 1999). 
(b) Mutations and other related effects 
Vinyl fluoride is mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium , Chinese hamster ovary cells 
and Drosophila melanogaster  and induces micronucleus formation in the bone-mar row 
cells of female mice in vivo (IARC, 1995). 
Ten rat and 10 mouse liver angiosarcomas from the 2 -year study of Bogdanffy et al . 
(1995) were analysed for the presence of point muta tions in Ki- ras  exon 1 and Ha- ras  
exon 2 by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformational polymorphism and 
sequencing. No specific hot-spot mutation could be identified, although some samples 468 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97  
 displayed a shifted band of low intensity in the si ngle-strand conformational poly-
morphism analysis (Boivin-Angèle et al ., 2000). 
4.3 Mechanisms of carcinogenesis 
The metabolism of vinyl fluoride is thought to be s imilar to that of vinyl chloride and 
vinyl bromide, and occurs at similar rates in human , rat and mouse livers (Cantoreggi & 
Keller, 1997). Vinyl fluoride is probably activated  by CYP2E1 to 2-fluoroethylene oxide, 
which rearranges to 2-fluoroacetadehyde (Holt et al ., 2000). Exposure of mice and rats to 
vinyl fluoride results in the formation of N2, 3-εG, one of the promutagenic adducts that 
may be implicated in the mutagenicity and carcinoge nicity of vinyl chloride.  
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
Vinyl fluoride is a flammable gas that is produced in a limite d number of countries. It 
is used predominantly for the production of polyvin yl fluoride and other fluoride poly-
mers. The use of vinyl fluoride is increasing. Work ers may be exposed during the manu-
facture of vinyl fluoride monomer and during produc tion of the polymers. 
5.2 Cancer in humans 
No data were available to the Working Group. 
5.3 Cancer in experimental animals 
Vinyl fluoride was tested by inhalation in one stud y in rats and one study in mice. It 
increased the incidence of haemangiosarcomas in bot h sexes of mice and rats. Vinyl 
fluoride also increased the incidence of tumours of  the lung and Harderian gland ade-
nomas in male and female mice and mammary gland tum ours in female mice, and that of 
Zymbal gland carcinomas in male and female rats and  of hepatocellular neoplasms in 
female rats.  
5.4 Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Vinyl fluoride is readily absorbed after inhalation . The metabolic pathways of vinyl 
fluoride are thought to be similar to those of viny l chloride and vinyl bromide. The initial 
oxidation results in formation of fluoroethylene ox ide, a reaction that is probably medi-
ated by cytochrome P450 2E1. In-vitro studies indic ate that the rate of vinyl fluoride  VINYL FLUORIDE 469  
 
 metabolism in human liver microsomes is comparable with that in rodent cells. Pharma-
cokinetic data indicate that the metabolism of viny l fluoride is saturated at about 75 ppm 
(∼140 mg/m 3) in rats. 
Fluoroethylene oxide and fluoroacetaldehyde are met abolites of vinyl fluoride that 
can form DNA adducts that are similar to those form ed by metabolites of vinyl chloride. 
These include N7-(2-oxoethyl)guanosine and the cyclic adducts ethe nodeoxyguanosine, 
ethenodeoxyadenosine and ethenodeoxycytidine, which  can cause miscoding by 
modifying base-pairing sites. N7-(2-Oxoethyl)guanosine and ethenodeoxyguanosine 
adducts were found in the liver of rats and mice after 1 yea r of exposure to vinyl fluoride. 
In addition, a correlation between the amount of th e ethenodeoxyguanosine adducts and 
the incidence of vinyl fluoride-induced angiosarcom as was observed in both species. 
Vinyl fluoride was shown to be mutagenic in bacteri a, Chinese hamster ovary cells 
and Drosophila . 
6. Evaluation and Rationale 
6.1 Carcinogenicity in humans 
There is inadequate evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of vinyl fluorid e. 
6.2 Carcinogenicity in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of  vinyl 
fluoride. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
Vinyl fluoride is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A).  
6.4 Rationale 
In making the overall evaluation, the Working Group  took into consideration the fact 
that all available studies showed a consistently pa rallel response between vinyl fluoride 
and vinyl chloride. In addition, both vinyl chlorid e and vinyl fluoride are activated via a 
cytochrome P450 2E1-dependent pathway to their corr esponding epoxides. For both vinyl 
chloride and vinyl fluoride, the covalent binding o f these compounds to DNA yields 
promutagenic etheno adducts. The weight of positive  evidence for both compounds was 
also noted among the studies for genotoxicity, alth ough the number and variety of tests 
for vinyl fluoride were fewer. For practical purpos es, vinyl fluoride should be considered 
to act similarly to the human carcinogen, vinyl chl oride. 470 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 97
