BARBERS AND PERSONAL USE OF HAIR COLOURANTS 
1. Exposure Data 
1.1 Introduction 
Throughout history and acro ss cultures, women as well as men have felt the need to 
change the natural colour of their skin, lips an d hair, or to restore the colour of greying 
hair. For thousands of years, cosmetic dyes ha ve been a part of all human cultures. The 
use of hair dyes can be traced back at l east 4000 years; evidence from royal Egyptian 
tombs suggests the use of henna for dyeing of hair and fingernails. Henna contains the 
dye Lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), wh ich, in its pure form, is also used as a 
synthetic direct (semi-permanent) hair dye. In the days of the Roman Empire, grey hair 
was darkened by combing it with lead combs dipped in vinegar. Interestingly, it has 
recently been shown that this application produces darkening of  grey hair by deposition of 
lead sulfide nanoparticles (diameter of abou t 5 nm) on the surface of the hair (Walter et 
al., 2006; Nohynek et al. , 2004a). Traditional, lead acetat e-based products  for darkening 
grey hair are still found on the internationa l market, although their importance is minor. 
Today, millions of consumers use a large variety of cosmetic dyes and pigments to 
change the appearance of their skin, lips, nails  or hair. Hair dyeing has become a common 
practice in modern industrialised societie s; the hair-dye indu stry has estimated 
(unpublished data) that between 50 and 80% of women have used hair dyes in the USA, 
Japan and the European Union.  During the last century, synthetic dyes have taken a 
pivotal role in hair colouration. Their ch emistry, use and safety have been reviewed 
(Corbett 1999, 2000; Corbett et al. , 1999; Nohynek et al. , 2004a; Zviak & Millequant 
2005a,b). 
1.2 Composition of modern hair dyes 
Modern hair dyes may be classified into  the following categories: oxidative 
(permanent) dyes, direct (temporary or semi-permanent) dyes, and natural dyes. 
In the frequently used code system introd uced by the European Cosmetic Association 
(COLIPA), hair-dye ingredients are classifie d into classes A, B or C: class A includes 500 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 ingredients of oxidative hair dyes, class B those of semi-permanent hair dyes, and Class C 
those of temporary hair dyes (see ex amples in Tables 1.4, 1.5, 1.6). 
1.2.1  Oxidative (permanent) hair dyes 
(a) Composition 
Oxidative (permanent) hair dyes are the most important group and have a market 
share in the EU or the USA of  approximately 80% (Corbett et al. , 1999). 
Oxidative (permanent) hair dyes consist of two components that are mixed before use 
and generate the dye within the hair by ch emical reactions. Their chemistry and use has 
recently been reviewed (Corbett et al. , 1999; Zviak and Millequant, 2005b). Modern 
oxidative dyes contain several ingredients with different functions (examples in 
507Table 1.1) as follows: 
Primary intermediates : arylamines ( para-phenylenediamine (PPD), para-
toluenediamine (PTD), substituted para-diamines), para-aminophenols ( para-
aminophenol, 4-amino- meta-cresol), 4,5-diaminopyrazole and pyrimidines. Oxidation 
of these substances and their chemical co upling with modifier (coupler) molecules 
result in coloured reaction products. 
Couplers or modifiers : these include meta-substituted aromatic derivatives 
(m-phenylene-diamines, meta -aminophenols, resorcinol),  pyridines and naphthols. 
Couplers determine the final shade by reaction with the oxidized form of primary 
intermediates, followed by further oxidative coupling reactions. Oxidants : hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, sodium percarbonate, perborate. 
Alkalinising agents : ammonia, monoethanolamine or aminomethylpropanol. 
(b) Relative concentration of the components 
The actual colouring mixture is prepared ex temporaneously, before application to the 
hair, by mixing, generally weight by weight, a solution containing the precursors and the 
other components of the formula with a solution containing hydrogen peroxide called developer. Each of these two solutions amounts in  general to 50 g per use, but it is not 
uncommon to use 40 g of a colourant formula mixed with 60 g of developer. With non-
lightening oxidative colouring the amount of developer may be twice the amount of colourant formula. The final mixture applied to the hair amounts to about 100 g but can 
vary according to the amount of hair to be treated. 
Given that it is diluted by the developer, if the original concentration of a precursor 
(base or coupler) is X, its concentration in th e final mixture coming into contact with the 
hair, is, at most X/2. 
In practice, the initial concentration X used lies between 0.006% and 7%. This range 
of concentrations corresponds to a spectrum of shades from very pale blond to black. This  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 501

is how the 20–70 shades of an oxidation-dye formulation are built up. It is worth noting 
that in the market: 
• About 50% of shades contain no more than  0.5% precursors or colourants as a 
whole; 
• About 25% of shades contain between 0. 5% and 0.75% overall precursors or 
colourants; and 
• About 25% of shades contain more than 0.75% of total precursors or colourants, 
with even fewer shades with a concentrat ion reaching or excee ding 3.5% before 
mixing the developer. 
The concentrations mentioned above represent the total content of precursors or 
dyestuffs (sometimes as many as 10) that is necessary to achieve the desired shade. More 
precisely, oxidation-dye products consist of a mixture of two or three bases, four or five  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 503  
 couplers and sometimes one or two direct co lourants (see below) (Zviak & Millequant, 
2005b). 
The shade/colour achieved on the hair depends on the ingredients and their 
concentrations. Given the number of ingredients and the different resulting colour 
tones, a clear correlation of hair-dye shad e with the concentration of the primary 
intermediate and coupler cannot be made . The dye shade, however, permits an 
estimation of the ingredient concentrations: dark hair dyes tend to contain the highest 
concentration of ingredients, whereas li ght (blond) shades tend to contain lower 
concentrations. 
1.2.2  Direct hair dyes 
Direct hair dyes include semi-permanent (resisting several shampooing processes) or 
temporary (resisting one or few shampooing processes) hair dyes. Direct hair dyes 
represent the second category of ec onomically important hair colorants. 
Semi-permanent colouring agents contain low-molecular-weight dye molecules, such 
as nitro-phenylenediamines, nitro-aminopheno ls, and some azo or anthraquinone dyes. 
These dyes may be used on their own in semi-per manent hair dyes or in combination with 
oxidative hair dyes in permanent hair-dye products to improve the tone of the final colour 
on the hair. 
Temporary dyes represent the third class of ha ir colours. Temporary colouring agents 
are relatively large molecules and include azo-, triphenylmethane-, indophenol- or 
indamine-type dyes (Zviak & Millequant, 2005a)  that are less resistant to washing and 
may be rinsed off by a single or a few shampooing processes. Typical formulations of 
semi-permanent hair dye are presented in Table 1.2. 
1.2.3  Natural hair dyes 
The majority of natural dyes use henna (p roduced by extraction of the leaves of a 
North African shrub ( Lawsonia inermis ) or the pure dye ingredient of henna, i.e. Lawsone 
(2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone). Henna has a lo ng history of widespread use as a natural 
hair and body dye; however, a warning was raised against Lawsone by the Scientific 
Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Commission (SCCNFP 
2004). In addition, the repor ted increase in the use of Henna mixed with synthetic dye 
molecules, such as para-phenylenediamine (Black Henna) or other aromatic amines as a 
direct hair dye or body paint is of concern (Onder, 2003; Arranz Sánchez et al. , 2005). 
Other natural dyes include extracts of Cham omile, indigo and various woods, barks or 
flowers (Zviak and Millequant, 2005a). 
Natural dyes extracted from plants are of relatively small but growing economic 
importance.

 1.2.4  Trends in composition over time 
The invention, history and use of oxidative hair dyes and their ingredients has been 
reviewed (Corbett, 1999). The components of  oxidative hair dyes have considerably 
changed since their introduction at the end of the 19th century. In the early phase, aromatic 
amines (primary intermediates, para-diamines, para-aminophenols) were used on their 
own in combination with hydrogen peroxide. During the period up the 1920s it was found 
that primary intermediates ( para-diamines, para-aminophenols) may be combined with 
coupler molecules (resorcinol, meta-diamines, meta-aminophenols) to form coloured end 
products on oxidation. Thus in the early 1 930s, the principal primary intermediates and 
couplers used today were already on the ma rket. From the 1930s up to the 1970s there 
was little innovation in the components of oxidative and direct hair dyes; in the 1960s 
most manufacturers used a basic palette of 10–15 typical dye components; substances 
used in the period between the early 1930s to the 1970s  are shown in Table 1.3.

In the 1970s and 1980s, majo r changes took place in the composition of direct and 
oxidative hair dyes. First, numerous innovative dyes were discovered, and several new direct and oxidative substances were intro duced on the market. Second, in 1975, the 
positive results of mutagenicity tests in Salmonella typhimurium  (Ames test) initiated a 
long-lasting controversy about the genotoxic and/or carcinogenic potential of some hair dyes, when Ames et al.  suggested that nearly 90% of oxidative hair-dye ingredients were 
mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  and might therefore pose a carcinogenic risk to 
consumers (Ames et al. , 1975). 
On the basis of a worldwide survey co ordinated by the EU, US and Japanese 
Cosmetic Associations during late 2007/ear ly 2008, there would currently be 50 506 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 ingredients of oxidative, 43 ingredients of semi-permanent, and 88 ingredients of 
temporary hair dyes on the international mark et (EU, North- and Latin-America, Asia). 
1.3 Production volumes 
The major ingredients in oxidative hair dyes and their approxim ate annual worldwide 
tonnage of use (2005) are shown in Table 1. 4. These data suggest that the bulk of 
substances used in oxidative hair dyes (total worldwide use at 50 to 250 tonnes) consist of 
traditional ingredients, such as resorcinol, para-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminotoluene 
and 4-amino-2-hydroxytoluene, para- and meta-aminophenol, 2-methyl-5-hydroxyethyl-
aminophenol and 4-amino- meta -cresol. A few other ingredie nts are used at an annual 
tonnage of 10 to 50 tonnes, whereas most oxidative hair-dye ingredients are used at 
relatively minor amounts at 5 tonnes or less. 
The estimated worldwide annual (2005) use of  semi-permanent hair dyes is shown in 
Table 1.5. These data reveal a to nnage significantly lower than that of oxidative hair dyes 
and reflect their lesser economic importance. With the exception of two nitro-phe nol-type 
semi-permanent dye ingredients (2-amino-6-chloro-4-nitrophenol and 4-hydroxypropyl-
amino-3-nitrophenol), which are used at 5 to 15 tonnes per year, most substances are 
below 5 tonnes, whereas three substa nces are below 0.5 tonnes per year. 
The estimated worldwide annu al (2005) use of temporary hair dyes is shown in 
Table 1.6. The total annual use of most of th ese dyes is < 5 tonnes, except for Acid Violet 
43 and Acid Red 33, which are used at 5 to 10 tonnes per year. 
1.4 Application and formation of hair dyes 
1.4.1  Application of hair dyes 
Oxidative and direct hair dyes are applied to  the hair in aqueous solutions or as a gel 
at a maximal concentration of 2.0 to 3.0% of the primary dye ingredient (dark-shade hair 
dyes) or < 0.05% (light-shade hair dyes) (see paragraph 1.2.1). After a contact time 
varying from a few to approx imately 30 min permitting the hair-dyeing process to take 
place, the dye is rinsed off, and the hair is  shampooed, rinsed, cut and dried. Detailed 
modern hair-dyeing techniques were recently reviewed (Zviak & Millequant, 2005a and 
2005b). 
1.4.2  Reaction products of hair dyes 
Taking into account the standard  volume of 80 mL of commercial hair-dye formulations, 
human external exposure during hair colouring would be in the range of 40 to 2400 mg. 
The frequency of hair-dye use varies between once per month (temporary hair dyes) to once per 6–8 weeks (oxidative hair dyes).

 An analytical methodology based essen tially on HPLC was developed, which 
allowed the study of the kinetics of oxidative hair-dye coupling chemistry under conditions reflecting consumer usage, i.e. colour formation over 30 min (SCCNFP 2004, 
opinion 0941/05; Rastogi et al. , 2006). The methodology was applied to 11 different 
combinations of hair-dye precursors and couplers, and demonstrated that the amount of colour formed increases with tim e, while the amounts of free precursors and couplers 
decrease. Only the expected reaction products – based on the chemis try of the oxidative 
coupling of precursors and couplers – we re formed, and no significant additional 
reactions or unexpected products were de tected. Self-couplin g products (such as 
Bandrowski´s base) or transient intermedia tes were not detected in the hair-dye 
formulations. 
During the dyeing pro cess, the consumer is exposed to the precursor(s), the coupler(s) 
and the expected reaction product(s). The kineti cs of colour formation also revealed that 
the exposure of the consumer to the reactio n product (hair dye) is much less than the 
exposure to the precursor and coupler ove r the whole application time. The total 
concentrations of unreacted precursors and couplers in various experiments were 12–84% 
of the applied dose. The typical concentratio n of reaction products in the formulations 
after 30 min varied from 0.02% to 0.65%. A worst-case scenario fo r the exposure from 
hair dyes in the dyeing process was derived fr om the data: the maximum content of a hair 
dye formed in the formulation 30 min after application was 0.65%. In a 70-ml (= 70-g) 
formulation this equals to 455 mg of hair dye formed. 
1.5 Personal use of hair colourants 
The main route of exposure to hair-dye components during personal use of hair 
colourants is dermal. Several studies have measured dermal and systemic exposure to 
hair-dye components, mainly by use of para-phenylenediamine (PPD) or [
14C]-labelled 
PPD. 
In a study from the USA, seven hair dyes (oxidative and direct) were [14C]-labelled 
and applied onto volunteers (W olfram & Maibach, 1985). Th e extent of scalp penetration 
was slightly higher for direct dyes but in neither case did it exceed 1% of the applied dose. 
In a study on percutaneous absorption of PPD during an actual hair-dyeing procedure, 
urinary levels of PPD metabolites were monitored during 24 or 48 hours after the dye had 
been applied (Goetz et al. , 1988). The fraction of the applied dose found in the urine 24 
hours after application ranged from 0.04% to 0.25%. This study also showed a five- to 
ten-fold decrease in PPD penetration when the scalp was protected with clay before 
applying the dye. 
In a study from Taiwan, China (Wang & Tsai , 2003), five volunteers dyed their own 
hair with various dye products containing different concentrations of PPD (2.2–3.2% or 
1.1–1.6 g). The PPD excretion in the urine after 48 hours was 0.02–0.45% of the total dose. 510 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Eight volunteers (Hueber-Becker et al. , 2004) received an oxidative hair-dye 
application containing [14C]-PPD. The dye remained on the hair and scalp for 30 min. In 
the urine samples collected afterwards, 0.50±0. 24% of the total applied radioactivity was 
recovered. The mean systemic dose was cal culated to be approximately 0.09±0.04mg 
[14C]-PPD-equivalents/kg body weight. In an in-vitro  human skin study, a total of 
2.4±1.6% of the applied radioactivity was absorbed (found in epidermis, dermis and 
receptor fluid), corresponding to an  absorption rate of 10.6±6.7 μgeq/cm2. In the same 
eight volunteers, specific PPD metabolites were  measured: five different metabolites were 
found, mainly N-mono-acetylated and N,N′-diacetylated PPD (Nohynek et al. , 2004b). 
1.5.1  Estimation of the internal dose to the user of hair-dye ingredients 
According to its “Notes of Guidance”, the Scientific Committee for Consumer 
Products (SCCP) assesses hair dyes based on data  of percutaneous absorption, mainly 
from in-vitro studies with human or pig skin. In a typical study, 20 mg of a representative hair-dye formulation per cm
2 is applied onto the skin. Following a 30-min contact time, 
the amount of hair dye in the epidermis ( stratum corneum  excluded), dermis and the 
receptor fluid after 24 hours is determined and summed-up to provide a worst-case value 
for the systemic (internal) dose. Taking  the commercially important hair dye para-
phenylenediamine (PPD) as an example, and using a worst-case scenario for a 60-kg adult 
person, the systemic exposure dose was estimated to be 0.052 mg/kg bw, calculated as follows: 
A maximum concentration of 4.0% of PPD is mixed before use with H
2O2. Thus the 
usage volume of 100 ml contains at maximum 2.0% PPD. Assuming the highest 
penetration (0.00447 mg/cm2) and a typical human body weight (60 kg) and exposed 
scalp area (700 cm2), this would give a systemic exposure dose of 0.00447 mg/cm2 x 
700 cm2/60 kg = 0.052 mg/kg body weight. (source:  SCCP’s “Notes of Guidance” for the 
testing of cosmetic ingredient s and their safety evaluation, 6th revision, adopted by the 
SCCP during the 10th plenary meeting of 9 December 2006). 
1.6 Occupational exposure as a hairdresser and barber 
Occupational exposure studies in hairdressers have mainly focused on airborne 
exposure. Only few studies have measured de rmal and systemic exposure of hairdressers 
to certain chemicals. 
1.6.1  Airborne exposure in hairdressing salons 
In addition to hair dyes, hairdressers can be  exposed to a wide variety of chemicals. 
Studies to measure the airborne occupational exposure of hairdressers are summarized in 
Table 1.7. In these studies, ethanol is genera lly used as a marker for solvent exposure, and 
para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is often u sed as a marker for dye exposure.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 511  
 The exposure to organic solvents is generally highest in the hairdressers’ breathing 
zone during the mixing and application of chemicals to the hair. The exposure time is usually short, varying from tens of seconds (hair sprays) to tens of minutes (permanent 
solutions and dyes) (Leino, 20 01), but these tasks may be repeated many times a day. 
Several studies showed that local exhaust ventilation can significantly reduce airborne exposure (Hollund & Moen, 1998; Leino, 2001),  but also indicated that it is seldom used. 
The exposure of hairdressers to oxidative hair dyes was measured under controlled 
conditions. Three separate phases of  hair dyeing were monitore d: (1) dye preparation/hair 
dyeing, (2) rinsing/shampooing/conditioning, an d (3) cutting/drying/styling, on eighteen 
hair dressers working for six hours with a dark-s hade oxidative hair dye containing 2% of 
[
14C]-para-phenylenediamine (PPD). The detected  PPD-equivalents in personal air 
samples (charcoal cartridges) were higher du ring the hair-dyeing phase than during the 
other phases, and ranged from < 0.25 μg (detection limit) to 0.88 μg with a mean 
exposure time of ~30 min (Hueber-Becker et al. , 2007).

1.6.2  Dermal and systemic exposure 
In a study from Sweden (Lind et al. , 2005) the dermal exposure of 33 hairdressers 
was assessed with a hand-rinse method (Lind et al. , 2004). Samples were taken in the 
hairdressing salons during normal working hours: before the hair-dyeing procedure, after the application of the hair dye, and after cutting of the newly dyed hair. The samples were 
analysed for five different co mpounds used in common commercial hair-dye products in 
Sweden: 1,4-phenylenediamine (PPD), toluen e-2,5-diaminesulphate (TDS), 3-aminophenol 
(MAP), resorcinol (RES), and 2-methyl-reso rcinol (MRE). The r esults are shown in 
Table 1.8. The maximum levels detected after ap plication of hair dyes were: 939 nmol per  514 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

hand for PPD, 244 for MAP, 741 for TDS,  773 for RES and 187 for MRE. Positive 
findings were also reported for samples taken before mixing hair-dye cream with 
oxidizing cream. This exposure may derive from previous hair-dyeing activities on the same day or from background exposure from contaminated surfaces. Hand exposure was 
not significantly lower in hairdressers work ing with gloves compar ed with hairdressers 
not using gloves while dyeing hair. It was noted, however, that gloves were often re-used and could be a source of contamination. 
In a later study, the penetration of PPD, TDS, and RES through protective gloves 
during hairdressing was investigated: when properly used, all the tested gloves gave  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 515  
 considerable protection against permeation of the hair-dye components studied (Lind et 
al., 2007). 
A study among 18 hairdressers in controlled conditions using radioactive PPD (2%) 
in hair dyes measured systemic exposure to PPD (Hueber-Becker et al. , 2007). No 
radioactivity above the limit of detection (< 10 ng PPD eq/ml) was found in blood samples. 
Several urine samples contained no measurable or quantifiable radioactivity. Using the 
detected urinary levels and the urine volu me, the mean urinary excretion across all 
hairdressers during the working-day was calculated to be < 25 ± 5.2 μg [14C]-PPD eq. 
1.7 Regulations and guidelines 
The legislation of cosmetics and the regulation of ingredients in hair-dye formulations 
in the EU and the USA differ . During the 1980s, several putative carcinogenic hair-dye 
substances were banned in the EU, but not in  the USA. Furthermore,  in April 2003 the 
EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Products  (SCCP) started a strategy to ensure the 
safety of hair-dye products. The SCCP foresees banning of all permanent and non-
permanent hair dyes for which industry has not submitted a safety file for the substances 
involved, and of those on which the SCCP has issued a negative opinion. Table 1.9 gives 
the list of ingredients that are currently not pe rmitted in hair-dye prod ucts in the European 
Union. A substantial number of those ba nned substances were of limited commercial 
interest. 
The Japanese regulation of cosmetics is the mo st restrictive. All cosmetic products are 
considered equivalent to drugs and are thus subject to premarket approval by the Ministry 
of Health and Welfare, and may contain only those ingredie nts included in the 
Comprehensive Licensing Standards of Cosm etics by Category (C LS); these ingredients 
must be conform certain defined specificatio ns. Other Asian countries (e.g. Republic of 
Korea and China) have developed regulato ry requirements for hair dyes and their 
ingredients similar to those in Japan (Corbett et al.  1999; Nohynek et al.  2004a). 
In response to occupational safety concerns, i.e. the risk for developing contact 
dermatitis, international hair-dye label wa rnings recommend that hairdressers wear 
protective gloves during the hair dyeing and rinsing processes (W ilkinson and Shaw, 
2005). 516 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

2.1 Occupational exposures of hairdressers and barbers 
2.1.1  Cohort studies  (Table 2.1) [Only studies not included in the previous IARC 
Monograph (Volume 57) are listed in the Table].  
Alderson (1980) followed a sample of 1831  male hairdressers identified at the 1961 
census of England and Wales until 1978. Mortal ity from all cancers was similar to that 
expected (134 obs., 126.1 ex p.), and no specific cancer showed a significant excess: 
oesophagus, 5 obs., 3.4 exp.; lung, 52 and 50.8; bladder, 7 and 5.6; leukaemia, 3 and 2.7. 
Kono et al.  (1983) followed the mortality of a cohort of 7736 registered female 
beauticians from 1948 to 1960 in Fukuoka Prefec ture, Japan, for an average of 22.5 years. 
Among the site-specific cancers examined, only stomach cancer occurred in significant 
excess (61 observed, 45.59 expected; 95% CI, 1. 02–1.72). They found no case of bladder   HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 521

Teta et al.  (1984) examined cancer incidence du ring 1935–1978 in 11 845 female and 
1805 male cosmetologists in Connecticut (U SA) who had held licences for five years or 
more and had begun hairdressing school befo re 1 January 1966. A significant excess of 
lung cancer (standardized incidence ratio [S IR], 1.41) and excesses of brain (SIR, 1.68) 
and ovarian cancer (SIR, 1.34) of borderline significance were observed among women; 
the SIR for bladder cancer was 1.36 (95% CI , 0.74–2.27), on the basis of 14 cases. No 
significant cancer risk was evident for fema le cosmetologists licensed since 1935, even 
for those with 35 years or more of follo w-up, although the SIRs for brain cancer, 
lymphoma and leukaemia were elevated. Female cosmetologists who had entered the profession between 1925 and 1934, however, e xperienced a significant overall increase in 
cancer incidence (SIR, 1.29) and significant excesses of respiratory cancer and cancers of 
the breast, corpus uteri  and ovary. Among the men in the cohort, there was no excess of 
cancers at all sites (77 observed, 73.4 expect ed), but cancers of the brain occurred more 
frequently than expected (4 observed, 1.9 expected). [The Working Group noted that no 
other numbers were given for cancers at specific sites in men.] 
Gubéran et al.  (1985) studied cancer mortality during the period 1942–1982 and 
incidence in the years 1970–80 in a cohort of 703 male and 677 female hairdressers in 
Geneva, Switzerland. Increased mortality from bladder cancer was observed among men 
(10 observed, 3.9 expected; P < 0.01) and women (2 observed, 1.0 expected). The 
corresponding values for incident cases were 11 and 5.3 for men ( P < 0.01) and 2 and 1.5 
for women. Significant ( P < 0.05) excesses of incident cases of cancer of the buccal 
cavity and pharynx (6 observed, 2.5 expected) and of prostate cancer (12 observed, 
6.1 expected) were seen in men in the peri od 1970–80. No case of cancer of the buccal 
cavity and pharynx was seen in women (0.8 exp ected); for neither of these sites, however, 
was there an excess in the longer period covere d by the mortality analysis (1942–1982). A 
nested case–control study of 18 cases of bla dder cancer among men in this cohort 
(10 deceased, six incident cases that occurre d during 1970– 1980 and two incident cases 
that occurred in 1981) showed a non-signifi cantly longer duration of exposure (measured 
from the start of apprenticeship) among those who dressed men’s hair but not among 
those who dressed women’s hair. Enquiries indi cated that the great majority of male 
hairdressers in this study never dyed men’s ha ir. In the period 1900– 1950, application of 
brilliantines to men’s scalps after haircuts w as widespread in Geneva. The authors stated 
that those preparations may have contained co louring agents that are bladder carcinogens, 
such as para-dimethylaminoazobenzene, chrysoidine and auramine, which have been 
found in brilliantines in other countries. They also mentioned that 2–naphthylamine has 
been found as an impurity in Yellow AB and Yellow OB, which have been used in cosmetics. 
In a brief note, Shibata et al.  (1990) reported three deaths from leukaemia 
(3.84 expected) and two from lymphoma (3.01 expected) in a cohort of 8316 male and female barbers surveyed in the period 1976–1987 in the Aichi Prefecture, Japan. 532 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 In a cohort study of 248 046 US male veterans who served during 1917–1940 and 
were interviewed in 1954 or 1957 on smoking habits and occupations, Hrubec et al.  
(1992) analysed the mortality pattern of 740 barbers through 1980. Smoking-adjusted 
relative risks were 1.2 for all cancers (110 deaths; 95% CI, 1.06–1.45), 1.6 for respiratory 
cancers (95% CI, 1.22–2.20), 1.5 for prostate cancer (95% CI, 1.03–2.15) and 2.5 for multiple myeloma (95% CI, 1.08–5.63). No excess was found for bladder cancer 
(3 deaths; OR, 0.7). 
Morton (1995) estimated br east-cancer incidence by compiling all cases first 
diagnosed during the period 1963–1977 among residents of the Portland-Vancouver 
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area by sear ching records of all 24 hospitals (16 of 
which had tumour registries) in the four coun ties. An additional 1.8% of total cases were 
identified through death certif icates. The total number of breast-cancer cases identified 
was 7368. For resident women aged 16–68 the usual occupation was retrieved from 
census data, and mean age-standardized inci dence and mortality rates per 100 000 women 
were computed for each occupational category. The mean annual incidence rate among 
beautician was 125.2/100 000, not significan tly different from that for all women. The 
mortality rate was 55.2/100 000, significantly higher than the rate for all women. 
In a cohort of 563 395 female participants in Cancer Prevention Study II, a 
prospective mortality study enrolling volunteers from all US states interviewed in 1982 
and followed up until 1991, 1780 fatal br east cancers were identified. Among women 
whose main lifetime occupation was beautician, th e rate ratio, adjusted for age and several 
known or potential risk factors, was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.62–1.89), based on 16 cases (Calle et 
al., 1998). 
(a) Scandinavian cohorts 
Several cohort studies were conducted in the Scandinavian countries, often based on 
overlapping populations. Consequently, thei r results are not always independent from 
each other. They have been grouped by country to better understand these 
interdependencies. 
(i) Denmark  
Bladder-cancer incidence was investigated in a cohort of 4874 men and 9497 women 
aged 20–64 years from Denmark, who declar ed “hairdresser” as occupation in the 1970 
census. Follow-up was performed up to 19 80 through record linkage with national 
mortality and migration databases. The obser ved number of cases of bladder cancer was 
obtained through record linkage with the national Danish Cancer Registry, which also 
provided incidence rates to compute the e xpected number of cases. In men, there were 
41 observed cases, as compared with 19.9 7 expected ones (SIR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.51–
2.78). In women, the observed and ex pected numbers of cases were 7 and 3.97, 
respectively, thus giving a SIR of 1.76 (95% CI, 0.71–3.63) (Lynge, 1990-1991). 
As a follow-up of the previous study th e cohort was then upd ated for the period 
1981–1987 and extended to several other cancer sites. During this period, 26 further cases  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 533  
 of bladder cancer occurred among men (SIR, 1.17, 95% CI, 0.77–1.72) and 5 among 
women (SIR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.28–2.04). Thus, for the overall period 1970–1987, the SIRs were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.24–2.01) in men and 1.23  (95% CI, 0.64–2.15) in women. In males 
during 1970–97 there were one case of cancer of  the oral cavity (SIR = 0.37, 95% CI: 
0.01–2.07), one of pharynx cancer (SIR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.01–1.64), 10 of larynx cancer (SIR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.51–1.95), 127 of lung cancer (SIR,,1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.43), 12 of 
NHL (SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.61 –2.06), 6 of Hodgkin disease (SIR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.73–
4.35), 13 of leukaemia (SIR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.54–1.74) and 520 of all cancers (SIR, 1.12; 
95% CI, 1.02–1.22). In females there were no  cases of cancer of the oral cavity (SIR, 0; 
95% CI, 0.00–2.29), three of pharynx cancer  (SIR, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.42–5.89), one of 
larynx cancer (SIR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.01–2.33) , 31 of lung cancer (SIR, 0.97; 95% CI, 
0.68–1.38), 16 of NHL (SIR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10–3.12), three of Hodgkin disease (SIR, 
0.90; 95% CI, 0.19–2.64), eight of leukaemia (SIR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.40–1.85) and 507 of 
all cancers (SIR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96–1.15) (Skov & Lynge, 1994). 
(ii) Finland  
In a study not entirely independent of that of Skov et al.  (1990), a cohort of 
3637 female and 168 male hairdressers, born in  or before 1946, who were members of the 
Finnish Hairdressers’ Association between 1970  and 1982, were followed-up for cancer 
incidence through the National Cancer Registry between 1970 and 1987 (Pukkala et al. , 
1992). Expected numbers of  cases were calculated by multiplying the number of person-
years in each age group by the corresponding overall cancer inciden ce in Finland during 
the period of observation. Among women, th ere were 247 cases of cancer, versus 195.0 
expected. Non-significant excesses were seen fo r breast cancer (70 cases, 56.3 expected), 
cervical cancer (11 cases, 7.1 expected), lung  cancer (13 cases, 7.6 expected) and ovarian 
cancer (21 cases, 12.8 expected ). Risks were not elevated for cancers at other sites, 
including the bladder (1 and 2.5), leukaemia (4 and 4.2) and multiple myeloma (1 and 2.4). The risk for all cancers was higher during the period 1970–1975 ( P < 0.05) than 
during 1976–1981 ( P > 0.05) or 1982–1987 ( P > 0.05). Among men,  25 cases of cancer 
were observed (17.9 expected; 95% CI, 0.90–2.06); nonsignificantly elevated risks were found for cancers of the lung and pancr eas, on the basis of seven and three cases, 
respectively. 
The incidence of ovarian cancer was studied in a cohort that included all 892 591 
economically active women in Finland, with oc cupations as reported in the 1970 census, 
who were born between 1906 and 1945. The follow-up period was 1971–1995. The 
National Cancer Registry was used for th e identification of ovarian cancer cases 
(n = 5072). The expected numb ers of cases were standardized by age, time period and 
social status, using rates of the entire cohort  as the standard. The SIR for hairdressers and 
barbers was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0–1.7), based on 57 cases, and that for beauticians was 1.0 
(95% CI, 0.2–2.9), based on three cases (Vasama-Neuvonen et al. , 1999). 534 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (iii) Sweden  
Pollán and Gustavsson (1999) studied the in cidence of breast cancer in a cohort of 
1 101 669 Swedish women, alive and 25–64 years of age on 1 January 1971, who were 
gainfully employed at the ti me of the 1970 census and had also been present in the 
country during the 1960 census. The follow-up period was 1971–1989. Vital status was ascertained from a population registry, while em igration was not considered. Linkage to 
the Swedish Cancer Environment registry was used to identify breast cancer cases 
(n = 29 284). Information on  occupation was extracted from the 1970 cen sus. For each 
occupation, expected numbers of cases were comp uted by use of age- and period-adjusted 
rates from the whole cohort. Among women employed as hairdressers or beauticians 
(total number not given), there were 284  observed and 258 expected cases of breast 
cancer, yielding a SIR of 1.10 (95% CI, 0.98–1.24). When further adjustment was made 
for area of residence and town size, defined from data extracted from the 1970 census, the 
relative risk (RR) was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.97–1. 23) when the reference was set to all women 
in the cohort, and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.08–1.37) when the reference was set to women in other 
occupations of the same group (services and military work). Among women who reported 
hairdresser or beautician as their occupation  in the 1970 census on ly, there were 85 cases 
of breast cancer, and the RR compared with women in other occupations of the same 
group was 1.09 (0.88–1.35). Among women reporting this occupation in both censuses 
(1960 and 1970), the number of breast cancer s was 199, and the RR was 1.27 (95% CI: 
1.11–1.47). 
Mutanen & Hemminki (2001) studied the incidence of childhood cancer in a cohort 
that comprised all Swedish children born  between 1935 and 1996 with a father 
(2.7 million) or a mother (1.0 million) w ith active occupation in the 1960 census, 
registered in the Swedish Family Cancer  Database. The foll ow-up was performed 
between 1958 and 1996 for the age group 0–14 years. Cancer data were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Expected numbers  of cases were calculated from reference 
incidence rates specific for 5-year age, ar ea and socioeconomic status. The total active 
population was used as the reference population. Among the children of all economically active fathers there were 3376 childhood- cancer cases, eight of  which were among 
hairdressers. Among children with economically active mothers there were 1408 
childhood-cancer cases, 37 of which among ha irdressers. Expected numbers for the whole 
group were not presented. There were four cases of kidney cancer among children of 
male hairdressers, compared with 0.4 expected (SIR, 10.6; 95% CI, 2.9–27.2). Among 
children of female hairdressers, there were 2 and 1.9 observe d and expected cases, 
respectively, for a SI R of 1.0 (0.1–3.7). 
All 1 670 517 women in Sweden who participated in both the 1960 and the 1970 
censuses, who were gainfully employed in 1960 or 1970, were followed-up until 1989 with regards to ovarian cancer incidence, th rough linkage to the Swedish Register of 
Causes of Death. The Swedish Cancer Regist er was used to iden tify 9591 cases of 
ovarian cancer occurring during follow-up. The total numbers of women in the cohort employed as “barbers, beauticians, etc.,” or in haircutting and beauty salons are not given.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 535  
 The relative risk associated with various occupations was calculated by Poisson 
regression, stratified by time categories b ased on the census when employment was 
reported (1960 only, 1970 only, or both).  Adjustment was performed for age. Among 
women who reported being employed as “barbers, beauticians etc.” in 1970 only, there 
were 14 cases of ovarian cancer (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9), there were 36 cases among women reporting it in 1960 only (RR, 0. 87; 95% CI, 0.6–1.2) and 51 cases among women 
reporting it in both censuses (RR, 1.21, 95% CI, 0.9–1.6). Among women who reported 
being employed in haircutting and beauty salons in 1970 only, 1960 only, and in both censuses, there were 12 (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9), 37 (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.6–1.2), and 
52 (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96–1.7) cases of ova rian cancer, respectively (Shields et al. , 
2002). 
Czene et al.  (2003) studied the incidence of vari ous cancers in a cohort comprising 
38 866 women and 6866 men in Sweden who declared being employed as “hairdressers, 
barbers, beauticians and others” in at least one of the four censuses of 1960, 1970, 1980 
and 1990. Of these, 67% of male and 41% of female hairdressers kept their occupation for 
at least two censuses. The fo llow-up period was 1960–1998. Tumour data were retrieved 
from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Expect ed numbers of cases were computed with 
reference to those who were economically activ e at least during one of the censuses, for 
those who were hairdressers in at least one cen sus, and to those economically active in 
1960 for those who were hairdressers in 1960. Th e rates used were sex-, period (5 years)- 
and age (5 years)-specific. For male hair dressers at any census, direct significant 
associations were found for cancers of the u pper aerodigestive tract (51 cases; SIR, 1.51; 
95% CI, 1.13–1.99), colorectal adenocarci noma (135 cases; SIR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04–
1.47) and lung cancer (141  cases; SIR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1. 13–1.99), and a borderline 
association for bladder cancer (87 cases; SIR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.98–1.51). No significant 
associations were found for ot her cancers of the digestive tract, urinary tract, skin, 
nervous system, thyroid, endocrine glands , connective tissue or for haematopoietic 
neoplasms. Results for male hairdressers at the 1960 census were similar. For female 
hairdressers at any census, direct significant associations were found for cancer of the 
pancreas (68 cases; SIR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03–1 .68), lung cancer (160 cases; SIR, 1.35; 
95% CI, 1.15–1.58), cancer of the cervix (213 cases; SIR, 1. 28; 95% CI, 1.13–1.48), and 
cancer of the skin in situ  (110 cases; SIR, 1.30; 95% CI , 1.07–1.55). No significant 
associations were found for othe r cancers, including in the br east, ovaria, and lung and for 
haematopoietic neoplasms, where the estim ated SIRs were below 1.10 (except for 
multiple lyeloma (MM)). Results for female hairdressers at the 1960  census were largely 
similar, although the associat ions with pancreas cancer (38 cases; SIR, 1.01; 95% CI, 
0.71–1.38) and cervical cancer (97 cases; SIR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.80–1.2 1) were no longer 
evident. 
Using the Swedish Family Cancer Database,  a cohort was formed  of all 1 644 958 
Swedish men economically active at th e 1960 census and all 1 154 091 women 
economically active at the 1970  census. In the cohort there were 4639 male and 16 360 
female hairdressers. Follow-up ended in 2000 . Linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry 536 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 identified 24 041 bladder, 35 776 lung and 11 627 upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) 
cancers in men, and 3405, 8352 and 1767 in women, respectively. Expected numbers of cases were computed using sex-, age (5 years) -, period (10 years)- and socioeconomic 
status (6 groups)- specific rates from the whole cohort. Among male hairdressers there 
were 144 cases of lung cancer (SIR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.20–1.54) and 92 (SIR, 1.19; 95% CI, 
0.96–1.44) among female hairdressers (Ji & Hemminki, 2005a). A significant increase in 
risk for bladder cancer was found in men (S IR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01 –1.54; 88 cases). The 
authors tried to adjust for the effect of sm oking by dividing the SIR by 35% of the excess 
of lung cancer. The smoking-adjusted SIR was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.88–1.34). Among 
hairdressers in two consecutive censuses (1960  and 1970) there were 62 bladder-cancer 
cases, and the SIR was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.88–1.4 5) before and 1.00 (0.76–1.26) after 
adjustment for smoking. The corresponding values for those who were hairdressers at the 
censuses of 1960, 1970 and 1980 were 1.35 (95% CI, 0.91–1.84) and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.81–
1.60), based on 33 cases. For women, data for bladder cancer were not presented, because 
no significant association was found (Ji et al. , 2005). Among male hairdressers, there 
were 49 UADT cancers (SIR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1. 03–1.81). When subsites were considered, 
the SIR was significantly increased for cancers of the tongue (9 cases; SIR, 2.41; 95% CI, 
1.09–4.25) and larynx (21 cases; SIR, 1. 78; 95% CI, 1.10–2.62). The excess in UADT 
cancers was still significant when analysis was restricted to men who were employed as 
hairdressers in both the 1960 and the 1970 censuses (34 cases; SIR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.01–
1.98), or in all three censuse s of 1960, 1970 and 1980 (16 cases; SIR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.12–
3.04). For female hairdressers the SIR of  UADT cancers was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.02–2.23), 
based on 26 cases. When subsites were considered, the observed numbers were small, and a significant increase was found for cancer of  the pharynx only (n ine cases; SIR, 2.49; 
95% CI, 1.13–4.39) (Ji & Hemminki, 2005a). 
A subsequent cohort study was based on the same data, and had the same design as 
that described above (Ji & Hemminki, 2005b ), and although the number of hairdressers 
was not given, it appears to be the same as mentioned before (4639 male and 16 360 
female hairdressers). In this case, the follow -up was extended to 2002, and the neoplasms 
investigated were leukaemias. In the whole cohort of economically active men in 1960 
there were 11 002 leukaemia cases, and in eco nomically active women in 1970 there were 
4040. No excess was found for all leukaemi as for male (27 cases; SIR, 0.85; 95% CI, 
0.56–1.21) or female (39 cases; SIR, 1.02;  95% CI, 0.73–1.37) ha irdressers. When major 
leukaemia subtypes were considered sepa rately, no excess was seen for CLL, AML, 
CML or PV in either sex. When analysis w as restricted to women who were hairdressers 
in both censuses of 1960 and 1970, the SIR for PV was significantly elevated (7 cases; 
SIR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.40–6.64 ) (Ji & Hemminki, 2005b). 
(iv) More than one Scandinavian country  
Following a report by Lynge and Thygesen (1988) on Danish hairdressers, Skov et al.  
(1990) carried out an analysis of the incide nce of bladder cancer and lung cancer in men  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 537  
 and women employed as hairdressers and beauticians in 1960 in Norway and Sweden and 
as hairdressers and barbers in 19 70 in Denmark and Finland. 
Lynge and Thygesen (1988) found an increased risk for bladder cancer in hairdressers 
in Denmark: the RR was 2.05 for men, on the basis of 41  cases (95% CI, 1.51–2.78), and 
1.76 for women, on the basis of seven cases (95% CI, 0.71–3.63 ). No corresponding 
increase in lung cancer was observed. In Finl and, Norway and Denmark, the expected 
numbers of cancer cases were calculated by mu ltiplying the person-y ears at risk for each 
of the five-year birth cohorts of hairdresser s by the sex-specific in cidence rate for the 
equivalent five-year birth cohort of all people who were economically active at the time 
of the census. In Sweden, the expected  number of cancer cases was calculated by 
multiplying the number of hairdressers in a give n region of Sweden in  each five-year birth 
cohort at the time of the cen sus by the sex-specific estimat ed cancer probability for the 
equivalent five-year birth cohort of all people in the region. National figures were 
obtained by aggregating the observed and the expected numbers across the 27 Swedish 
regions. The pattern of excess bladder-cancer  incidence without a corresponding increase 
in lung-cancer incidence was not found in any of the other Nordic countries (Skov et al. , 
1990). 
In Sweden (Malker et al. , 1987; Skov et al. , 1990), the inciden ce of lung cancer was 
increased in male (98 cases; RR, 1.5; 95% CI , 1.2–1.8) and female (31 cases; 1.6; 1.1–
2.2) hairdressers, and bladder-cancer incide nce was increased in men (54 cases; 1.5; 1.1–
1.9) but not in women (six cases; 0.4; 0.2–1. 0). The authors noted that a national survey 
of smoking in Sweden carried out in 1963 had found that 74% of male barbers and 
beauticians aged 50–69 were regular smokers , compared with 46% of all men aged 50–
69 years. In Norway, the incidences of bla dder cancer and lung cancer were increased in 
hairdressers (RR, 1.4–1.6), but the increase was significant only for lung cancer in men. 
In the data from Finland, no case of bladde r cancer was recorded among male hairdressers 
in the period 1971–80 (expect ed, 0.3), but three cases occurred in women (1.8 expected). 
The incidence of lung cancer was not increased : three observed, 2.0 expected in men and 
two observed, 4.4 expected in women (Skov et al. , 1990). The incidence of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma was examined in Denmark (1970–80) by occupational category by Skov and 
Lynge (1991) using a similar method. No significant excess was observed in female 
hairdressers (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.24–7.15; two cases); no case was recorded among male 
hairdressers. When all groups of hairdressers were included  (self-employed/barber, work 
in beauty shops and hairdresser), the RRs we re 1.3 (0.48–2.83; six cases) for men and 2.0 
(0.81–4.14; seven cases) for women. 
Boffetta et al.  (1994) studied the incidence of ovarian cancer and NHL in a cohort of 
29 279 women from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, aged 20–64 years in 1970, 
who declared being employed as a hairdresser  in the 1970 census questionnaire. They 
were followed-up between 1970 and 1985 (1987 for Denmark). Date of death or 
emigration was obtained through linkage to appropriate population registries; linkage to 
the four national cancer registries identif ied cases of ovarian cancer and NHL in the 
cohort. The observed incidence was compared  with the expected one using national 538 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 5-year age-specific rates in the overall fema le population at the censuses. SIRs were 
calculated as the ratio of observed and expe cted cases, and 95% CIs by use of Byar 
approximation. Overall, 127 ovarian cancer cases were observed in the cohort, compared 
with 107.8 expected (SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.98–1.40). The SIRs were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0–
1.9), 1.1 (95% CI, 0.0–1.6) and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8–1.4) for the periods 1971–1975, 1976–1980 and 1981–1985, respectively. The overall SIR for NHL was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.84–
1.66), from 36 observed cases. 
Using the same methods as Boffetta et al. , Andersen et al.  (1999) conducted a 
systematic analysis of cancer risk in 10 298 male and 26 545 female hairdressers from 
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. In men, there was a significant increase for all 
sites combined (SIR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06–1. 18; 1302 cases). Significant increases were 
found for lung cancer (SIR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1. 07–1.37; 249 cases), blad der (SIR, 1.47; 95% 
CI, 1.25–1.73; 147 cases) and skin cancers other than melanoma (SIR, 1.22; 95% CI, 
1.01–1.48; 105 cases). No association was fo und for NHL (SIR = 1.01), multiple 
myeloma (SIR = 1.00) or other haemolymphopoietic malignancies, while the SIR for lip 
cancer was significantly decreased (SIR, 0.34 ; 95% CI, 0.11–0.76; 5 cases). For women, 
the SIR for all sites was 1.05 (95% CI , 1.00–1.09) based on 2178 cases. Significant 
increases were found for cancers of the phary nx (SIR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.18–3.62; 14 
cases), lung (SIR, 1.22; 95% CI , 1.02–1.46; 122 cases), cervix uteri  (SIR, 1.21; 95% CI, 
1.03–1.43) and ovary (SIR, 1. 18; 95% CI, 1.01–1.38 ). No increase in risk was found for 
bladder (SIR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.63–1.23; 37 cases), breast (SIR, 1.05; 0.97–1.13; 643 
cases) or haemolymphopoietic cancers (SIR 1. 06 for NHL, 0.80 for multiple myeloma).

(a) Bladder cancer  (Table 2.2) [Only studies not included in the previous 
IARC Monograph (Volume 57) are listed in this Table] 
In a case–control study, Glash an and Cartwright (1981) in terviewed all patients with 
bladder cancer presenting in three Yorkshir e (United Kingdom) centres over a 3-year 
period (744 men and 247 women). Controls were 993 men and 345 women without 
malignant disease, age- and sex-matched to cases. Mantel-Haenszel ORs adjusted for age, 
sex and year of diagnosis were computed; the OR for “hairdressers” was 0.9 (95% CI, 
0.3–3.2). 
Schoenberg et al.  (1984) conducted a population -based case–control study in 1978–
79 in New Jersey, USA, on 706 white male patients aged 21–84 years with newly 
diagnosed, histologically confirmed cancer of the bladder or papilloma not specified as 
benign, and 1392 controls select ed with random-digit dialling (<65 yrs) or from Medicare 
lists (age 65–84). Participation rates were 89.7% for cases, 86.6% for controls. Twenty 
cases and 38 controls were excluded from th e analysis because of incomplete or 
unreliable interview. ORs were estimated by multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, smoking and 19 employment categori es. Twelve cases and 17 controls were ever 
employed as barbers or hairdressers, and th e corresponding OR was 1.27 (0.59–2.73).  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 539

 Kunze et al.  (1992) conducted a hospital-based case–c ontrol study in northern Germany 
(1977–1984), including 531 male patients with an epithelial neoplasm of the lower urinary tract and an equal number of controls admitted to urological wards with benign 
urological diseases (64% with pr ostatitis or prostatic hypert hropy) individually matched 
by age to cases. Two percent of the cases re fused to participate. The smoking-adjusted 
conditional OR for having ever worked as a hairdresser was 1.7 (95% CI, 0.6–4.5), based 
on 10 exposed cases and six exposed controls. 
Cordier et al.  (1993) conducted a hospital-based case–control study in seven French 
hospitals between 1984 and 1987. Cases were  765 patients (658 men and 107 women) 
below age 80 years, with a histologically confirmed bladder cancer diagnosed after 
1 January 1982 (527 (69%) were interviewed less than one year after diagnosis) and no previous history of cancer. Controls were patients with no history of cancer admitted to 
the same hospitals for causes other than cancer, respiratory disease or symptoms 
suggestive of bladder cancer, in dividually matched to cases by sex, age, ethnic origin and 
place of residence. Participation rates we re not given. ORs were estimated by 
unconditional logistic regressi on including the matching variables and smoking. For 
subjects who had worked at least six months  as hairdressers (five cases and two controls) 
the OR was 2.21 (95% CI, 0.41–11.94). 
Bolm-Audorff et al.  (1993) conducted a hospital based case–control study on 
239 male and 61 female histologically co nfirmed cases of lower urinary tract cancers 
(90% of the bladder) identified in four clinics in two areas of Germany between 1989 and 
1992, and an equal number of controls admitted to the same clinics for non-malignant 
diseases of the urinary tract, individually matched to cases by sex, age and residence. 
Response rate was 93% for cases and 98% for controls. Among men, five cases and three 
controls were employed as hairdressers, and the smoking-adjusted OR was 4.05 (95% CI, 
0.63–26.09). Among women, two cases and no co ntrols were exposed. The OR for both 
sexes combined was 6.48 (95% CI, 1.15–36.51). 
Teschke et al.  (1997) conducted a p opulation-based case–cont rol study in British 
Columbia, Canada, between 1990 and 1992 , including 105 cases of bladder cancer 
(88 men and 17 women) and 48 cases of cancer of the nasal cavity or sinus (33 men and 
15 women), all histologically confirmed. Controls were 128 men and 31 women 
randomly selected in age and sex strata from the provincial voters list. Since recruitment 
of bladder-cancer cases was restricted to t hose born after 1915, only 112 male and 
27 female controls were used for this ca ncer. Participation rates were 89% for nasal 
cancer, 88% for bladder cancer, and 81% for controls, and next-of-kin interviews were conducted for 15%, 18% and 14%, respectivel y. ORs were adjusted for sex, age and 
smoking. Three bladder-cancer cases and one cont rol had ever worked as a hairdresser or 
barber; the OR was 3.2 (95% CI, 0.2–176).  When the more recent 20 years were 
removed, two cases and one control were expo sed (OR 2.6; 95% CI, 0.1–159). One nasal 
cancer case and one control were e xposed (OR 2.5; 95% CI, 0–225). 
Sorahan et al.  (1998), in a popula tion-based case–control study from the West 
Midland Region, United Kingdom, interviewe d 1427 cases (1106 males and 321 women) 546 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 born in 1915–70 and diagnosed with a primary urothelial tumour between 1991 and 1993. 
A first set of controls was selected by aski ng general practitioners (GP) of the cases to 
each select three patients matched on sex and year of birth. Of the 908 GPs contacted, 
55% accepted to participate, representing a total of 615 cases. Out of 1845 potential 
controls, identified 1147 (62%) filled in the questionnaire. A further set of 1768 potential controls matched to cases on age, sex and GP  were selected through  the Family Health 
Service Authorities, 1052 (60%) of whom returned the questionnaire. [Note: sex 
distribution of contro ls not given]. The primary analys is was performed on the 803 cases 
(624 men and 179 women) for which at least one matched control was available, and 
2135 controls correctly matched to cases. A further analyses was conducted on all 
1427 cases and 2199 controls. The conditional OR adjusted  for smoking and for ever 
having been employed as a hairdresser in the primary analysis was 1.70 (95% CI, 0.74–
3.89), based on 11 cases and 18  controls. When all cases and controls were considered, 
there were 22 exposed cases and 19 exposed cont rols, and the OR adju sted for age, year 
of birth and smoking was 1.63 (95% CI, 0.86–3.12). 
Data from 11 case–control studies on bla dder cancer conducted between 1976 and 
1996 were combined, and results were pu blished separately for women (’t Mannetje et 
al., 1999) and men (Kogevinas et al. , 2003). Subjects outside the age range 30–79 years 
and prevalent cases were excluded. Among women, 700 cases of bladder cancer and 
2425 controls (761 hospital and 1664 population controls ) were included. Eleven cases 
and 56 controls had worked as hairdresser, barb er, or beautician, and the OR adjusted for 
age, smoking, study centre and centre-age interaction was 0.8 (95% CI, 04.–1.7), 
compared with those never employed as a hairdresser. Among men, 3346 cases and 6840 controls were used for the analyses, of whom 37 and 62 , respectively, had ever been 
employed as a hairdresser. Compared with men never employed in eight previously 
defined high-risk occupations (including hairdressers), the OR adjusted for age, smoking 
and study centre of those ever employed as a hairdresser was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.70–1.70) 
(’t Mannetje et al. , 1999; Kogevinas et al. , 2003). 
Gago-Dominguez et al.  (2001a) conducted a populati on-based case–control study in 
Los Angeles, California, USA, which involved 1514 (72%) non-Asian patients aged 25–
64 years with incident histologically confirmed bladder cancer diagnosed between 1987 
and 1996, identified th rough the SEER cancer registry of Los Angeles County. For each 
case a neighbourhood control was matched on  sex, date of birth, ethnicity and 
neighbourhood of residence (69% were the first eligible contro l) [Sex distribution of cases 
and controls was not given]. Twenty cases and 13 controls were employed as hairdressers 
or barbers for at least one year, and the smok ing-adjusted OR was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7–3.2). 
The OR was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2–1. 6) for those employed for l ess than 10 years, based on 
six cases and 10 controls, and 5. 1 (95% CI, 1.3–19.2) for thos e employed for 10 or more 
years, based on 14 cases and three controls. 
Zheng and colleagues (2002) conducted a population-based case–control study on 
1452 histologically confir med incident bladder-cancer cases (1135 men and 317 women) 
aged 40–85 years identi fied by the State Health Registry of Iowa, US, between 1986 and  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 547  
 1989, and 2434 (1601 men and 833 women) population controls, frequency-matched by 
sex and age to cases of cancers at several orga n sites. Participation rate was 85% for cases 
and 80–82% for controls. For 156 cases, proxy interviews were conducted. Among men, 
five cases and three controls were exposed for at  least five years in barber shops, giving 
an OR (adjusted for age, smoking, family history of bladder cancer) of 1.8 (95% CI, 0.4–8.0). All exposed subjects had worked for 10 or more years in barber shops. No data were 
presented for women. 
Gaertner et al.  (2004) conducted a population -based case–control study in seven 
Canadian provinces, including 535 male and 352 female patients aged 20–74 years with 
incident, histologically confirmed bladder cancer between 1994 and 1997, identified 
through cancer registries. Controls were 1430 men and 1417 women randomly selected either by random-digit dialling  (two provinces) or from the provincial health insurance 
database (five provinces) in 1996. Participat ion rates were 58% for male cases, 61% for 
female cases, 59% for male controls and 65% fo r female controls. ORs were computed by 
means of unconditional logistic  regression models and adjusted for age, province, race, 
smoking, consumption of fruit, fried food and coffee, and employment in potentially 
hazardous occupations (as printers, rubber work ers, metal workers, truck drivers, painters, 
dry cleaners, mechanics and mach inists). Occupations held for at least one year full-time 
equivalent were considered relevant. Among men, eight cases and six controls had 
worked as hairdressers (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1. 09–10.8): one case and no controls for less 
than five years, four cases and two controls for 5–15 years (OR 4.7;  95% CI, 0.79–27.9) 
and three cases and four controls for over 15 years (OR 1.98; 95% CI, 0.4–9.7;  P for 
trend, 0.24). Among women there were six cases and 34 controls exposed (OR 0.75; 95% 
CI, 0.28–2.01). 
Dryson et al.  (2008) interviewed 213 out of all incident cases of bladder cancer aged 
25–70, reported to the New Zealand Cancer Registry in 2003–2004 (64%; 165 men and 48 women), together with 471 population controls (48% of eligible controls; 221 men and 
250 women) in a population-based case–control  study. ORs were adjusted for age, sex, 
ethnicity and smoking. Six cases and three contro ls had worked as a hairdresser for more 
than one year; the OR was 9.15 (95% CI, 1.60–52.22). Among men, two cases and no 
controls were exposed, and among women fo ur cases and three controls (OR 9.95; 95% 
CI, 1.37–72.21). Similarly, fo r the industrial classificatio n “hairdressing and beauty 
salon” the OR was 5.35 (95% CI, 1.37–20. 9), based on seven cases and five controls, 
three and none respectively among males, and four and five among women (OR, 4.79; 
95% CI, 0.90–25.32). No consistent pattern by duration of employment was seen, but 
numbers were small. For hairdressers, the OR  was 2.87 (95% CI, 0.59–13.89) in ever-
smokers and 9.66 (95% CI, 0.62–151.42) in non-smokers. 
A mailed questionnaire was sent to 332 male  subjects with histologically ascertained 
bladder cancer, and as controls 566 with pr ostate cancer, who requested an after-care 
treatment in Bochum, Germany between 1992 and 1995. Of these, 63% of bladder and 
72% of prostate cancer cases responded. Afte r further exclusion of 53 bladder and 
69 prostate cancer cases because they either were not resident in North-Rhine Westphalia, 548 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 had both bladder and prostate cancer, were first diagnosed before 1988 or did not specify 
first diagnosis, had asked for aftercare for another disease, or did not complete the questionnaire, 156 bladder and 336 prostate cancer cases were av ailable for analysis. Four 
bladder and two prostate cancer cases had work ed as a hairdresser for more than one year, 
and the corresponding age- and smoking-adjusted OR was 4.90 (95% CI, 0.85–28.39) (Golka et al. , 2008). 
(b) Childhood cancers  (Table 2.3) 
The association between parental occupation and the risk for neuroblastoma was 
evaluated in a population-b ased case–control study conducted  in 139 hospitals in the 
United States and Canada from 1992 to 1996.  Of 741 eligible cases, information was 
obtained for 538 (73%) case mothers and 472  (64%) case fathers (directly for 405 and 
from the mother for 67). Cont rols were selected by random -digit dialling (RDD), and 
individually matched to cases on date of birth. The response rate for the RDD screening 
phase was 74%. Of 708 eligible controls, information was obtained for 504 (71%) 
mothers and 446 (64%) fathers (directly for 304 and from the mother for 142). 
Conditional logistic regression was used to obtai n the OR adjusted for age, mother’s age, 
race and education, and household income in birth year. Expos ed subjects were defined as 
those who had worked as a barber or hairdr esser for at least six months. Two case fathers 
and one control father had worked as a barb er or hairdresser; the OR was 3.3 (95% CI, 
0.2–45.7). There were 24 expo sed case mothers and 10 control mothers, giving an OR of 
2.8 (95% CI, 1.2–6.3) (Olshan et al., 1999). 
(c) Breast cancer  (Table 2.4) 
Band et al.  (2000) conducted a population-based  case–control study on occupational 
risk factors and breast-cancer risk by menopa usal status in British Columbia, Canada. 
Cases were women below age 75 years with Canadian citizenship, residing in British 
Columbia, English-speaking and without pr evious history of br east cancer, diagnosed 
with histologically-confirmed breast cancer  between June 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989, 
identified through the British Columbia Cancer Registry. Controls were women randomly 
selected from the 1989 British Columbia Provincial Voters List, matched to the cases by 
5-year age group, with no diagnosis of  breast cancer before. For breast-cancer cases, 
permission from the physician was reque sted before contacting the patient. A 
questionnaire eliciting information on lifetime job descriptions, occupation and industry titles, duration and period of work was mailed to cases and controls. The questionnaire 
collected information also on socio-demographic, anthropometric, menstrual and 
reproductive factors, smoking and drinking habits, exogenous estrogen use and family history of breast cancer. If the questionnaire was incomplete, subjects were contacted by 
telephone to collect missing data. Of 1489 e ligible breast-cancer cases identified, 
1018 (68.4%) returned a comple ted questionnaire (for 58 cases the physician did not grant   HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 549

up). Of 1502 women selected as controls, 359 refused to participate, 10 were deceased, 108 were lost to follow-up and 1025 (68.2%) returned the questionnaire. After further 
exclusion of cases and controls with no matc hes or with missing information, 995 cases 
(297 pre-menopausal and 690 post-menopausal) and 1020 controls (332 pre-menopausal and 675 post-menopausal) were available for th e analysis. Conditional logistic regression 
models were used to estimate ORs and 90% CI s for occupational variables. At first, 
potential confounders to be in cluded in the model were select ed from several factors by 
keeping the ones significantly associated with breast-cancer risk in a forward selection 
procedure. Then the ORs for each occupation and i ndustry type for whic h at least three 
cases were exposed were estimated in turn, fo r all women and separately for pre- and 
post-menopausal women. Usual occupation/industry (job held for the longest period) and 
ever occupation/indust ry (job ever held) were investig ated. Overall, 22 breast-cancer 
cases reported to have ever work ed as a barber or hairdresser, fo r an OR of 1.92 (90% CI, 
1.04–3.56) and 12 cases reported barber/hairdr esser as their usual occupation, for an OR 
of 1.02 (90% CI, 0.53–2.11). Among pre-menopausal women, 14 cases had ever been a 
barber or hairdresser (OR, 5.45; 90% CI, 1.85–16.09) and 7 cases reported barber or 
hairdresser as their usual occupa tion (OR, 2.71; 90% CI, 0.84– 8.74). In post-menopause, 
there were eight cases who had ever been a barber/hairdresser (OR,  0.84; 90% CI, 0.35–
2.01) and five cases whose usual occupation  was barber/hairdresser (OR not given). 
Habel et al.  (1995) conducted a population-base d case–control study of breast cancer 
in King County, Washington, USA. Cases were 537 white women aged 50–64 years, 
resident in King County, who were diagnosed with histologically confirmed first primary invasive or in situ  carcinoma of the breast between Janua ry 1988 and June 1990. Controls 
were 492 women selected by random-digit dialling, stratified by age, without history of 
breast cancer. Participation rate was 81%  for cases and 73% for controls. ORs were 
computed by means of logistic regression models  and adjusted for age,  education, parity, 
body-mass index, and alcohol. The three longe st-held occupations we re recorded for each 
woman. Seven cases and five cont rols reported having worked as a cosmetologist, and the 
OR was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.5–4.8). For all exposed women exposure began at least 10 years 
before diagnosis, while four cases and five cont rols had had the occupation for at least 
5 years (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.2–3.4). 
(d) Cancers of the haemolymphopoietic system (Table 2.5)  
Herrinton et al.  (1994) conducted a populati on-based case–control study on 
681 patients (321 women and 360 men) with incident multiple myeloma diagnosed from 1977 to 1981, identified thro ugh cancer registries in four geographical areas in the USA 
(Seattle, Utah, Detroit, Atlanta), and 1679 p opulation controls (746 women and 933 men) 
frequency-matched to cases on sex, age and r ace. Participation rate was 89% for cases and 
83% for controls. Proxy interviews were condu cted for 36% of cases and 1% of controls. 
ORs were adjusted for age, sex, race, st udy centre and education. Among women, 
12 cases and 22 controls had been employed as a hairdresser for six months or more, and 552 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 the OR was 1.3 (95% CI, 0.60–2.7). Of these,  four cases and 15 controls were employed 
for longer than five years (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.21–2.0) . Only one male case and two 
male controls had worked as a hairdresser, yielding an OR of 1.5 (95% CI, 0.12–17). 
Results were similar when the analysis w as restricted to self-responders (OR 1.1 for 
women and 2.2 for men ever employed as a hairdresser). Mele et al.  (1994) carried out a hospital based case–control study on leukaemia and pre-
leukaemia in three hospitals located in Ro me, Bologna and Pavia, Italy, between 1986 
and 1990. Cases were 15 years or older, an d included 252 patients with acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) (129 men and 123 women), 100 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(ALL) (48 men and 52 women), 111 with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts 
(72 men and 111 women) and 156 with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) (97 men and 59 women). Controls were 1161 patients (399 men and 762 women) 
identified in outpatient departments on their first visit. ORs were adjusted for sex, age, 
education, residence and selected occupations. Among female controls, 1.6% had worked as a hairdresser. The percentage among female  cases were: 0.8% (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1–
6.8) for AML, 1.9% (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.1–8.0) for ALL, 2.6% (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 0.3–
45.3) for refractory anaemia with excess of blast s, and 4.1% (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.3–26.1). 
A population-based case–control study on haemolymphopoietic neoplasms was 
conducted in 12 areas of Italy. Included we re all newly diagnosed cases that occurred 
between 1991 and 1993 among residents, aged 20–74 years, identified through periodic survey of the relevant hospital department s in the study areas and in regional cancer 
institutes or university-affiliated haematol ogy departments. Controls were random 
samples of the general population resident in th e study areas, stratified by sex and age. Of 
3357 eligible cases and 2 391 eligible controls, an interv iew was obtained for 2737 (82%; 
1520 men, 1217 women) cases and 1779 ( 74%; 918 men and 861 women) controls. 
Proxy interviews were conducted for 19% of  cases and 5% of controls. The diagnosis of 
cases was NHL for 811 men and 639 women,  Hodgkin disease (HD) for 193 men and 
172 women, leukaemia for 383 men and 269 women, and multiple myeloma (MM) for 
133 men and 137 women. Mantel-Haenszel ORs adjusted for age were computed. Subjects were considered exposed if they  had worked as “hairdressers, barbers, 
beauticians and related workers” for at least fi ve years, excluding the five years before 
diagnosis. For women, there were nine ex posed cases with NHL/CCL (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 
0.7–7.1), five exposed leukaemia cases (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.7–7.1), three exposed MM 
cases (OR, 11.1; 95% CI, 1.8–67.0) and five  exposed HD cases (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.7–
6.5) (Miligi et al. , 1999; Costantini et al. , 2001). 
Coté et al.  (1993) conducted a study to investigate whether beauticians and 
cosmetologists with AIDS had an increased risk for NHL co mpared with other persons 
with AIDS. Cases were 2153 persons who died between 1987 and 1989 in 23 US states 
and had both AIDS and NHL listed as cause of death. Controls were 8612 subjects 
selected among persons who died of AIDS without NHL listed as a cause of death, 
frequency-matched to cases by sex, age and race. For nine (0.42%) cases and 56 (0.65%) 556 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 controls lifetime occupation on  the death certificate was beau tician or cosmetologist, and 
the OR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.3–1.13). 
(e) Other cancers   
(i) Cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract (Table 2.6) 
Boffetta et al.  (2003) conducted a multicentre po pulation-based case–control study of 
cancer in the larynx and hypopharynx in the early 1980s in six high-incidence areas: 
Calvados in France, the province of Varese and the city of Turin in Italy, the canton of 
Geneva in Switzerland, and the provinces of Zaragoza and Navarra in Spain. All of these 
the areas were covered by cancer registration.  Cases were 1010 men with histologically-
verified incident epidermoid carcinomas of the larynx and hypopharynx (ICD-9 146.4, 
146.5, 148, 149.8 and 161). Participation rate  was around 75% in Spain and Italy, > 90% 
in Geneva and lower in Calvados, where r ecruitment was limited to the main cancer 
hospital. Controls were 2176 men who were a representative sample from the general 
population, selected by use of different so urces in the different areas, frequency-matched 
to the age and sex distribution of controls. Pa rticipation rate for controls was > 75% in 
Spain, Varese and Calvados, 64% in Geneva an d 56% in Turin. The occupational section 
of the questionnaire elicited the list of jobs held for at  least one year since 1945. 
Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs, which were adjusted 
for age, study area, and tobacco and alcoho l use. Thirteen cases and 18 controls had 
worked as a barber or hair dresser, and the estimated OR w as 2.33 (95% CI, 1.00–5.40). 
The ORs were 2.7, 2.2 and 2.2 for duration of employment of 1–10, 11–20 or 21 or more 
years, respectively ( P for trend, 0.09). 
Swanson & Burns (1997) conducted a po pulation-based case–control study in the 
three-county Detroit area, USA between 19 84 and 1991, including 163 (84 men and 
79 women) incident salivary gland cancer cases aged 40–84 years, and 3751 controls (1807 
men and 1944 women) who were population refe rents selected by ra ndom-digit dialling. 
Response rates were 96% and 97%, respectivel y, and proxy interviews were conducted 
for 23% of the cases and 8% of the controls. OR s were estimated with multiple logistic 
regression models, adjusted by age, race and smoking status. Exposed subjects were those 
ever employed as a hairdresser or in a beau ty shop, and were compared with those only 
employed in occupations with little or no ex posure to carcinogens. For men, too few cases 
were exposed to calculate ORs, while for women, seven cases and 56 controls had ever 
worked as a hairdresser (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1– 6.5) and eight women and 61 controls had 
worked in a beauty shop (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4–7.9).

Two studies reported results on the associati on between occupational exposure to hair 
dyes and lung cancer (Schoenberg et al ., 1987; Jahn et al ., 1999). Both had small 
numbers of exposed cases and exposed contro ls and were considered uninformative.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 557

 2.2 Personal use of hair colourants 
2.2.1  Cohort studies (see Table 2.7 for studies of urinary bladder, breast and 
haematopoietic cancers)  
Hennekens et al.  (1979) carried out a cross-sectio nal postal questionnaire survey in 
1976 on 172 413 married female nurses, ag ed 30–55, in 11 US states, whose names 
appeared in the 1972 register of the Amer ican Nurses’ Associa tion. Of the 120 557 
responders, 38 459 reported some use of pe rmanent hair dyes; of these, 773 had been 
diagnosed as having a cancer. The risk ratio for the association of cancers at all sites 
with hair-dye use (at any time) was 1.10 ( P = 0.02). When 16 cancer sites were examined 
separately, significant associations with perman ent hair-dye use were found for cancer of 
the cervix uteri  (RR, 1.44; P < 0.001) and for cancer of the vagina and vulva (RR, 2.58; 
P = 0.02). These associations weakened but re mained significant after adjustment for 
smoking habits. There was no consistent trend of  cancer risk with in creasing interval from 
first use of hair dyes, although women who had used permanent dyes during 21 years or 
more before the onset of cancer had a signif icant increase in risk for cancers at all sites 
c o m b i n e d  ( R R ,  1 . 3 8  adjusted for smoking; P = 0.02), largely because of an excess of 
breast cancers (RR, 1.48), which, howeve r, was balanced by a decrease of similar 
magnitude 16–20 years before the onset of cancer. Among the other cancer sites 
evaluated, no significant associatio ns were found that were related to personal use of hair 
dyes and lymphoma (RR, 0.59; P = 0.102) or urinary cancer (RR, 0.62; P = 0.296). 
Analyses of cases of cancer th at had occurred only afte r 1972 (the year the study 
population was defined from the nurses’ regist er) and were reported by surviving cases in 
1976 yielded essentially the same results, thus indicating that self-sel ection for the study, 
early retirement and loss from the profession al register were not sources of bias in this 
study. 
Green et al.  (1987) examined hair-dye use in rela tion to breast cance r in a follow-up 
study of a subgroup of the population described above, comprising 118 404 nurses who 
had no cancer in 1976 and were followed up to 1982. No relationship was detected: the rate ratio for ever-use was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9–1. 2) on the basis of 353 cases, compared with 
505 for never-use. The risk for breast cancer did not increase with frequency or duration 
of use. 
Another prospective cohort study from the Nurse’s Health Study (Grodstein et al. , 
1994) examined the relationship between perm anent hair-dye use a nd risks for incident 
lymphoma, leukaemia, and multiple myelom a. A total of 99 067 women aged 30–
55 years were followed through 1990. After eight years of follow-up, 244 incident 
haematopoietic cancers were identified, including 24 cases  of Hodgkin lymphoma, 144 
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 44 of leukaemia and 32 of multiple myeloma. No positive associations were observed between ever-use of permanent hair dyes and risk for all 
haematopoietic cancers (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7– 1.2) or specific type s, including Hodgkin 
lymphoma (OR, 0.9: 95% CI, 0.4–2.1), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.6), multiple myeloma (OR, 0.4; 95% CI , 0.2–0.9), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia   HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 559

 (RR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3–1.5), and other leukemias (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3–1.9). In the 
absence of information on no n-permanent hair-dye use a nd without repeated assessment 
of exposure in the follow-up period may in troduce misclassification of exposure, but the 
exposure misclassification is more likely to be non-differential and drives the association 
towards the null, because the exposure assessment was done before disease onset. 
Thun et al.  (1994) examined prospectively the re lationship between hair-dye use and 
the development of fatal cancer in 573 369 women. Women who had ever used 
permanent hair dyes showed a reduced risk fo r all fatal cancer combined (RR, 0.9; 95% 
CI, 0.9–1.0) and of urinary system cancers (RR,  0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9), and no increase in 
risk for any type of haematopoietic cancer. Women who had used black hair dyes for 
20 years or more had an increased risk for fatal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR, 4.4; 95% 
CI, 1.3–15.2) and multiple myeloma (RR, 4. 4; 95% CI, 1.1–18.3); however, these results 
are based on a very few exposed cases. No re lationship was found between the use of 
permanent hair dyes and fatal cancers of th e mouth, breast, lung, bladder or cervix. 
Altekruse et al.  (1999) examined cancer deaths linked  to use of permanent hair dye in 
a cohort of 547 586 women in the USA. Expo sure was assessed at the start of the follow-
up period. A small increase in risk for deat h from haematopoietic cancers (RR, 1.1; 95% 
CI, 1.0–1.2) and leukemias was observed in associ ation with more than 20 years of use 
(RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7). However, patterns by duration of use of dyes and type of 
colour were inconsistent. 
Henley & Thun (2001) analysed the mortality associated with hair-dye use based on a 
sample of 547 571 women from the ACS Ca ncer Prevention Study (CPS II). After 
16 years of follow-up, the death rate from bladder cancer was similar among women who reported ever using permanent hair dye to th at of never-users (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.4) 
and restricted to lifelong nonsmokers (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6–1.4). Among women who 
had used permanent hair dyes, no consistent  increase was seen in either the death rate 
from bladder cancer or the rate ratio  associated with hair-dye use. 
2.2.2  Case–control studies  (see Tables 2.8–2.11)  
The Working Group systematically reviewed  studies dealing with exposures of cases 
of cancer of the urinary bladder and breast (sites that have been studied extensively), 
lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms a nd childhood cancer. No systematic review 
was made of studies of other cancer sites.

 was added, and this question was answered by  51% of the male and female patients and 
by 93% of male and 80% of fe male controls. The crude OR for brilliantine use, relative to 
those reporting no use, was [1.7] for men (51 exposed patients; 95% CI, 1.1–2.6) and 
[1.1] for women (two exposed patients; 95% CI, 0.2–6.6). 
Jain et al.  (1977) reported (in a letter) data on  hair-dye use among 107 patients with 
bladder cancer and an equal number of sex- and age-matched controls in Canada. All 
male controls had benign pr ostatic hypertrophy, and all fe male controls had stress 
incontinence. The OR for blad der cancer in association with any exposure to hair dyes 
(based on 19 pairs discordant for use of hair dye) was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.41–3.03). [The 
Working Group noted that the choice of controls was unusually limited and may have 
introduced a detection bias.] 
Neutel et al.  (1978) reported (in a letter) data on hair-dye use in a subset of 50 case–
control pairs (matched by sex and 10-year age group) re-interviewed after a previous, 
larger case–control study of bladder cancer in Canada. Use of hair dyes was reported by 
18 cases and 19 controls. Frequent use of ha ir dyes and hairdressing as an occupation, 
however, were said to show protective e ffects (the former being significant, P < 0.01) 
against bladder cancer, although  the numbers on which these statements were based are 
not given in the report. 
In a study that examined bladder cancer  and occupational exposure of hairdressers 
and barbers, Howe et al.  (1980) found that eight male cases (including two of the barbers) 
and no male control had a history of personal use of hair dyes ( P = 0.004, one-tailed test); 
only one of them had used hair dyes for more  than six years before diagnosis of bladder 
cancer. There was no evidence in women of  an increased risk for bladder cancer 
associated with personal use of hair dy es (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.3–1.4 for ever-use vs never-
use). 
Hartge et al.  (1982) examined hair-dye use among participants in the US National 
Bladder Cancer Study in a case–control study of bladder cancer involving 2982 incident 
cases and 5782 controls, of whom 615 cases and 1164 controls had ever dyed their hair. 
The overall ORs for hair-dye users were 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9–1.4) among men and 0.9 (0.8–1.1) among women. ORs by frequency or duration of use ranged for both sexes from 1.0 
to 1.7, with no clear relationship with increasing duration or frequency among people of 
either sex. Use of black hair dye was associ ated with elevated ORs in both men and 
women; the OR was of borderline significan ce for the two sexes combined (OR, 1.4; 95% 
CI, 1.0–1.9; 68 exposed cases). 
Ohno et al.  (1985) conducted a case–control study of 65 female bladder-cancer 
patients in Nagoya, Japan, in the period 1 976–78. Hair-dye use wa s associated with an 
increased RR among those who smoked but not among non-smokers (RR, 1.31; 95% 
CI, 0.64–2.71). There was a positive relationship between smoking and hair-dye use more than once a month (RR, 25; 95% CI, 3.48–179.86); after adjustment for smoking, no 
significant effect of hair dyes remained (R R, 1.7; 95% CI; 0.82–3. 52; 22 exposed cases). 580 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 A matched case–control study was carried out by Claude et al.  (1986) of 340 men and 
91 women with bladder cancer in Lower Saxony, Germany, in the period 1977–82. It was stated that no association with hair-dye us e was found, but details  were not provided. 
Nomura et al.  (1989) carried out a case–control  study among 137 Caucasian and 
124 Japanese cases of cancer of the lower urinary tract in Hawaii (USA) and two 
population-based controls for each case, in the period 1977–86. A w eak, non significant 
association with hair-dye use was found fo r both men and women, but there was no 
positive trend with increasing duration of use. 
Gago-Dominguez et al.  (2001a) studied 897 incident cases of bladder cancer and 
897 matched controls in a po pulation-based case–co ntrol study conducted in Los Angeles 
between 1987 and 1996. In a cigarette-smoki ng-adjusted model based on 82 exposed 
female cases and 56 exposed female controls, exclusive use of permanent hair dyes was 
related to an increased risk for bladder cancer  (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.01–3.3). The longest 
female users of permanent hair dyes (i.e. > 30  years) had a 4-fold increase in the risk for 
bladder cancer. Men exposed to hair dyes were not at an increased risk for bladder cancer, 
although the estimates were based on small numbe rs. Based on a subset of the population, 
Gago-Dominguez et al.  (2001b) found a higher bladder-cancer risk among NAT-2 slow 
acetylators than among fast NAT-2 acetylators (O R, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.01–7.2 and OR, 1.1; 
95% CI, 0.4–2.7, respectively). In an extension of the study, Gago-Dominguez et al.  
(2003) confirmed this association and also found indications of an interaction between CYP1A2 slow metabolizers and permanent hair-d ye use in relation to bladder-cancer risk. 
In a population-based case co ntrol study conduct ed in New Hampsh ire in 1994–1998 
that included 459 incident bladde r cancer cases and 665 controls, Andrew et al.  (2004) 
found no overall indication of an increased bladder-cancer risk among hair-dye users, 
after adjustment for age, smoking and education level. However, women exposed to 
permanent hair dyes who had started their use be fore age 37 were at a 2.3-fold increased 
risk for bladder cancer (95%  CI, 1.1–4.6), based on 22 exposed cases and 32 exposed 
controls. Women with greater frequency of use and prolonged time since first use of 
permanent hair dyes were also at an increased  risk for bladder cancer. Subjects exposed 
for less than 11 years to perm anent dyes had a 1.7-fold excess in risk (95% CI, 0.8–3.7), 
and among those exposed for more than 11 years the risk was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7–3.2, P-
value for linear trend, 0.72). In an ex tension of the New Hampshire study, Kelsey et al.  
(2005) found that among bla dder-cancer cases, hair-dye use was significantly associated 
to TP53 immunohisto-chemistry inactivation (OR,  3.2; 95% CI, 1.4–7.2), but not to 
TP53  mutation (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.4–4.4), based on 282 cases who were never-users of 
hair dyes and 73 cases who had ever used hair dyes. 
In a case–control study conducted in Texas among 712 incident bladder-cancer cases 
and 712 hospital-based controls, Lin et al.  (2006) found no indicat ion of an increased risk 
for bladder cancer among users of permanent ha ir dyes after adjustment for age, sex, race 
and smoking, based on 100 exposed cases a nd 115 exposed controls (OR, 0.81; 95% 
CI, 0.50–1.30). No increased risks were foun d for other types of hair dyes or when  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 581  
 duration variables were assessed. Restriction of  the analyses to women only also showed 
no significant increase in risks. 
In a case–control study conducted in Spain between 1998 and 2001 among 
152 female bladder-cancer cases and 166 female controls, Kogevinas et al.  (2006) found 
no overall or specific indicatio n of an elevated risk for bladder cancer among hair-dye 
users (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5 –1.4), based on 78 exposed cases after adjustment for age, 
region and smoking. No increase in risk was observed for only permanent users for at 
least 10 times (OR,  0.8; 95% CI, 0.5–1.5), am ong users of only dark colour (OR, 1.1; 
95% CI, 0.5–2.5), or for self-applying of the dyes with no gloves (95% CI, 0.2–6.1). 
Users for more than 32 years showed a non- significantly increased risk of 1.2 (95% 
CI, 0.5–2.7). ORs were below 1.0 for high cu mulative exposure. There was no indication 
of an increased risk for bladde r cancer associated with the NAT2  genotype. 
Takkouche et al.  (2005) published a meta-analysis evaluating the association between 
use of hair dyes and risk for cancer. This meta-analysis of 10 studies (9 case–control and 
1 cohort) reached an overall risk estimate for bladder cancer of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.89–1.14). 
The pooled OR for permanent dye use was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.93–1.38) and 1.0 (95% 
CI, 0.82–1.22) for intensive exposure using fixed effects models. For random effects models the estimates were 1.13 (95% CI, 0.93–1.38) and 1.33 (95% CI, 0.69–2.56), 
respectively.  
(b) Breast cancer  (Table 2.9)  
Shafer & Shafer (1976) reported on 100 consecutive breast-cancer patients in a 
clinical practice in New York, USA, 87% of  whom had been long-term users of hair-
colouring agents, and a group of age-comparable controls, 26% of whom were regular users of permanent hair dyes over prolonged periods. [The Working Group noted the 
dissimilarity of the exposure definitions for the two groups and the lack of information on 
the number of controls or the manner of eliciting details on the use of hair dyes.] 
Kinlen et al.  (1977) reported a study of 191 breast- cancer patients interviewed in the 
hospital in 1975 and 1976 in Oxford, United Kingdom, and 561 controls without cancer, 
matched to the patients by age (within thr ee years), marital status and social class. 
Seventy-three cases and 213 cont rols had used permanent or semi-permanent hair dyes, 
giving an OR of 1.01. There was no evidence of  an increasing risk fo r breast cancer with 
increasing duration of use of hair dyes or with use beginning more than four or more than nine years before diagnosis. Stratification by age at first pregnancy showed a deficit of 
cases in which hair-dye use was reported among women whose first pregnancy occurred 
at ages 15–19 (33.3% of cases u sed hair dyes, compared with  64.7% of controls) and an 
excess of cases with use of hair dyes among women whose first pregnancy had occurred 
at 30 years of age or older (38.3% of cases and 25.5% of controls). There were two 
hairdressers among cases (1.0%) and 10 among controls (1.8%). 
Shore et al.  (1979) compared the hair-dye use of 129 breast-cancer patients and 
193 control subjects aged 25 and over, id entified from the records of a multiphasic 
screening clinic in New York City, USA. Adjusted ORs for use of permanent hair dyes  582 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 for 0, 5, 10 and 15 years were, respectively , 1.08, 1.31, 1.58 and 1.44 (none significantly 
different from 1.0). A significant relationship ( P = 0.01) was noted between a measure of 
cumulative hair-dye use (number of years times frequency per year) and breast cancer. 
This relationship also held if the analysis was limited to cases in which the patient herself 
had responded to the telephone interview. Among women who had used hair dyes 10 years before developing breast cancer, the re lationship held only for women at low risk 
(as assessed from the distribution of a multivar iate confounder score) and for those 50–
79 years old. [The Working Group noted that  the use of a multivariate confounder score 
for the control of confounding may produce misleading results.] 
To follow-up on these findings, Koenig et al.  (1991) carried out a case–control study 
of 398 women with breast cancer and 790 controls identified at the same screening centre. For ever-use, the adjusted OR was 0. 8 (95% CI, 0.6–1.1), and there was no trend 
with increased use. 
Stavraky et al.  (1979) compared 50 breast-cancer  cases at a cancer-treatment centre 
with 100 hospitalized controls in London , Ontario, Canada and 35 breast-cancer cases 
with 70 neighbourhood controls in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with respect to hair-dye 
use. The ORs for breast cancer from use of permanent hair dyes (at any time) were 1.3 
(95% CI, 0.6–2.5) in London an d 1.1 (0.5–2.4) in Toronto. Further statistical analyses, 
allowing for smoking habits, family history of cancer and age at first birth, showed no 
significant relationship between hair-d ye use and breast-cancer incidence. 
Nasca et al.  (1980) reported a study of 118 patients with breast cancer and 
233 controls matched to the patients by age and county of residence (115 matched triplets 
and three matched pairs) in upper New York St ate, USA. In the study  overall, there was 
no significant association between breast cancer  and use of permanent or semi-permanent 
dyes (OR, 1.11), nor was an increase in risk  seen with increasing numbers of times hair 
dyes were used or with increasing time sin ce first use. The authors commented that 
women who dyed their hair to change its colour, as distinct from those who dyed their 
hair to mask greyness, had a significantly in creased risk for breast cancer (OR, 3.13; 95% 
CI, 1.50–6.54). In this group,  there was a significant trend towards increasing risk with 
increasing numbers of exposures to hair dyes.  Examination of risk for hair-dye use in 
subgroups of women defined by other risk f actors for breast cancer showed an OR of 4.5 
(95% CI, 1.20–16.78) for women with a past  history of benign br east disease, an OR of 
1.75 ( P = 0.03, one-tailed test) for 12 or more years of schooling, and an OR of 3.33 (95% 
CI, 1.10–10.85) for women aged 40–49 years; the OR was near unity for all other age 
groups. These effects appeared to be independent of one another and were not explained by confounding by past pregnancy, age at first pregnancy, history of artificial menopause 
or age at menarche. The authors stressed that  the associations obser ved in the subgroups 
should be considered as newly generated hypoth eses, requiring further testing. In a larger, 
subsequent study (Nasca et al. , 1990) (reported as an abst ract) of 1617 cases of breast 
cancer in New York State and 1617 controls , these authors found no relationship with 
hair-dye use (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90–1.21), no significant difference in the ORs for 592 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 women with a history of benign breast disease (1.15; 95% CI, 0.86–1.53) and those 
without (0.98; 95% CI , 0.83–1.16) and no association with  duration of hair-dye use. 
Wynder and Goodman (1983) carried out a hospital-based case–control study of 
401 cases of breast cancer in New York City in 1979–1981. No association was found 
with hair-dye use (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78–1.32) and there was no dose–response relationship. 
Cook et al.  (1999) carried out a case–control st udy in Western Washington (USA) 
using the Cancer Surveillan ce System (CSS) to recruit 844 cases of breast cancer 
(747 invasive and 97 in situ ). The 960 controls were frequency-matched to cases by age. 
The aim was to evaluate use of hair colo uring and hair-spray application and breast-
cancer risk among women in their reproductive age. An increased risk was identified for ever-use of hair dyes (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1 .6) adjusted by age, parity, weight and 
history of breast cancer in first-degree relati ves. No relation to breast cancer risk was 
found for hair-spray application. 
In 2002, Petro-Nustas et al.  evaluated exposure to chemi cal hair dyes and the risk for 
breast cancer among Jordanian women. One hundred breast-cancer cases identified 
through the Jordan cancer regi stry and 100 population-base d controls were included, 
matched to age, parity, educa tion level and place of residen ce. A high prevalence in the 
use of chemical hair dyes was observed among cases compared with controls (95% vs 
51%) with an eightfold incr eased risk for breast cancer among users (OR, 8.62; 95% 
CI, 3.33–22.28). Information about frequency, colour, type and years of exposure was not 
available. 
Zheng et al.  in 2002 carried out a case–control study  in Connecticut, USA to evaluate 
personal use of hair dyes and risk for breast  cancer. A total of 608 incident breast-cancer 
cases and 609 population contro ls were included. No incr ease in risk associated with 
personal use of hair dyes was observed (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7–1.2) after adjustment for age, race, study site and age at menopause. Detailed information on duration, frequency, 
type and colour allowed quantitative study of risk; none of the ORs related to these factors 
was statistically significant. 
A meta-analysis by Takkouche et al.  (2005) included  12 case–control and two cohort 
studies, and reached an overall risk estimate fo r breast cancer of 1.04 (95% CI, 0. 98–1.09) 
with use of hair dyes. When restricted to  a population-based fra mework, the analysis 
showed an OR of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01–1.23). No association with use of permanent dyes 
(OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.94–1.05) or intensity of exposure (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.89–1.11) 
was identified under the assumptions of the fi xed effects model, and no differences in 
estimates were found under the hypothesis of random effects. 
(c) Lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers (Table 2.10)  
In a further report of the study of Stavraky et al.  (1979) in Canada, these authors 
found no significant increase in risk fo r leukaemia or lymphoma (70 cases) (Stavraky et 
al. (1981). [The Working Group noted that it was not possible to distinguish different 
haematopoietic malignancies.]  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 593

  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 607  
  
In a hospital-based case–control  study (101 matched pairs)  of acute non-lymphocytic 
leukaemia in the Baltimore (USA) area, pu blished only as an abstract, Markowitz et al.  
(1985) found a significant positive association  with hair-dye use (OR, 3.1). There was, 
however, no difference between regular use (at least once a year) (OR, 2.7) and less 
frequent use (OR, 2.2). 
Cantor et al.  (1988) carried out a p opulation-based case– control study of hair-dye use 
among 578 men with leukaemia, 622 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 1245 population 
controls in Iowa and Minnesota, USA, in  1980–83. Significantl y increased ORs were 
found for leukaemia (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–2.7) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 2.0; 
1.3–3.0) in association with personal use or other potential exposure to hair tints, any hair 
colouring product or hair dyes. The authors stated that the ORs did not substantially 
change after exclusion of the 10 men with other potential exposure to hair-colouring 
products (e.g., occupational exposure), but detailed results were not presented. [The 
Working Group noted that, although the au thors suggested an increased risk with 
increasing extent of hair-dye use, examination of the paper could not verify this.] 
A population-based case–co ntrol study carried out in ea stern Nebraska, USA, during 
1983–1986 investigated use of hair-colouring products among a total of 201 male and 184 female cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma,  35 male and 35 female cases of Hodgkin 
disease, 32 male and 40 female cases of multip le myeloma, 37 male and 19 female cases 
of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and 725 male  and 707 female residential controls who 
could be interviewed (Zahm et al. , 1992). Telephone interviews were conducted with 
cases, controls or their next of kin; response rates were 81–96% for cases and 84% for 
controls. Among women, use of any hair-c olouring pr oduct was associated with an 
increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (O R, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1– 2.2), Hodgkin disease 
(OR, 1.7; 0.7–4.0) and multiple myeloma (OR, 1.8; 0.9–3.7), and women who used 
permanent hair dyes had high ORs for all three neoplasms (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.8), Hodgkin disease (OR, 3.0, 95% CI, 1. 1–7.9) and multiple 
myeloma (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.1); all P < 0.05). For non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 
multiple myeloma, the risks were highest among women who used dark permanent dyes. Long duration and early age at first use tended to increase the risk among men, use of any 
hair-colouring product was associated with nonsignificantly increased ORs for Hodgkin 
disease (OR, 1.7), and multiple myeloma (OR, 1.8), on the basis of three and four 
exposed cases, respectively;  no increase was found for non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(OR, 0.8). Use of any hair dye was not associ ated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 
either women or men (OR, 1.0). 
A population-based case–control study of 17 3 white men with multiple myeloma and 
650 controls was carried out in Iowa, US A. The risk for multiple myeloma was 
significantly elevated (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1. 0–3.6; 14 exposed cases) among users of hair 
dyes. For men who had used hair dyes for one y ear or more at a frequency or one or more 
times per month, the OR was 4.3 (95% CI , 0.9–19.7; four exposed cases) (Brown et al. , 
1992). 608 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Herrinton et al.  (1994) carried out a case–control study to evaluate the relation 
between both personal exposure to hair dyes and the risk for multiple myeloma (MM) in the USA. Six hundred eighty-nine MM cases and 1681 controls were included. Among 
women, no significant increase in risk was ob served for personal use (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 
0.83–1.5). Results for males were also non-significant and based on small numbers of exposed cases. Informati on about colour and ty pe was not collected. 
Mele et al.  (1995) carried out a case–control study in  Italy to evaluate exposure to hair 
dyes and risk for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). A total of 254 cases and 1161 hospital controls were included. No significant 
associations were found for APL (OR, 1.5; 95 % CI, 0.6–3.7) or AM L (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 
0.5–1.3). No data were available for colour or frequency. 
In 1996, Ido et al.  carried out a case–control st udy in Japan. A total of 
116 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) cases from among hospital members of the 
Idiopathic Disorders Organs Research Co mmittee, and 116 hospital controls were 
included to evaluate exposur e to hair dyes. An increased risk for MDS was observed 
among users of hair-dye products (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.90–3.49), although it did not 
reach statistical significan ce. The odds ratio among women was 2.50 (95% CI, 0.97–
6.41). Although information about duration and frequency of hair-dye use was collected, 
no results about these associations were reported. 
Mele et al.  (1996) carried out another case–cont rol study in Italy. Thirty-nine 
thrombocythemia cases and 156 hospital controls we re included to evaluate both personal 
use of hair dye and occupational exposure. The prevalence of hair-dye exposure among 
cases was 38.2%. A non-significantly increased ri sk was reported (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.7–
3.2), although association between  dark hair-dye use and increased risk was statistically 
significant (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.4–19.9) when  the duration of exposure exceeded 10 years. 
Nagata et al.  (1999) evaluated the risk for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 
personal use of hair dyes using a case–control  study carried out in  Japan. A total of 
111 MDS cases and 830 controls randomly sel ected from the same prefecture as the cases 
responded to a health questionn aire. The risk for MDS for ever  having used hair dyes was 
1.99 (95% CI, 1.17–3.38). A statistically si gnificant trend was observed in risk with 
increasing years of exposure and number of hair-dye applications ever used. 
Holly et al.  (1998) carried out a case–control stud y in the San Francisco Bay area 
(USA) to evaluate the association of hair-dye use and the risk for non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL). A total of 713 NHL cases a nd 1604 population co ntrols were asked 
about type, colour, number of years of exposure for each product, age at first and last use, 
and frequency of use. Stratified results by ge nder were reported. No increases in risk were 
found for ever-use of hair dyes (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.77–1.30 for women and OR, 1.3; 
95% CI, 0.86–2.00 for men) or for years of use, lifetime frequency of use, colour or type. 
Miligi et al.  (1999) carried out a case–co ntrol study in Italy to study the role of hair-
dye exposure and occupation as a hairdresser in  the etiology of haematolymphopoietic 
malignancies. A total of 1170 cases (611 NHL, 260 leukaem ia, 165 Hodgkin lymphoma, 
and 134 multiple myeloma) and 828 populat ion controls were enrolled. The overall  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 609  
 estimation of OR for ever-exposure to hair dyes was not reported, but for none of the 
studied diseases was a significant risk observ ed. Among those women who had used dark 
permanent products, an increased in risk w as observed for leukaemia (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 
1.1–3.8). 
In 2001, Björk et al.  conducted a case–control study in Southern Sweden to evaluate 
the risk for Philadelphia chromosome-positive  chronic myeloid leuk aemia associated with 
the regular use of hair dyes. Among the 226 cases included, the prevalence of exposure to 
hair dyes was 11.1%, whereas that among th e 251 population controls was 26.4%. The 
estimated risk for ever-use of hair dyes was less among cases compared with controls 
(OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.18–0.68). Informa tion about dose-response was not provided. 
Schroeder et al.  (2002) carried out a population-based NHL study in Iowa and 
Minnesota (USA) to evaluate non-occupati onal exposures. A total of 622 cases and 
1245 controls were included. The study also  considered the pres ence of the t(14;18) 
translocation in the tumours. An increased risk for NHL with ever-use of hair dyes was 
observed independently of the t(14;18) translocation (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–3.4). An 
excess in risk was observed both among subjects with the t(14;18) tran slocation (OR, 1.8; 
95% CI, 0.9–3.7) and without the translocat ion (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–3.4). A large 
proportion of NHL (> 70%) could not be evaluated in histological subtypes due to lack of 
histological information. 
Pu et al.  (2003) carried out a case–control study (114 cases and 114 controls) on 
haematological cancer and report ed increased risks associated with ever-use of hair dyes 
(OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.59–7.18) and with in creasing frequency of use (OR, 3.28; 95% 
CI, 1.99–7.34). [The Working Group noticed  that the study did not provide enough 
methodological and statistical details to fully evaluate the results; these data are not 
included in Table 2.10]. 
Rauscher et al.  (2004) carried out a population-based acute leukaemia study 
evaluating the risk from ha ir-dye exposure. A total of 769 cases and 623 controls were 
interviewed in the USA and Canada. A slight increase in risk was observed for those ever 
exposed to hair dyes (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.99–1.80). In addition, the use of permanent dye only, for 15 years or more, was associated  with an increased acute leukaemia risk 
(OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.6). The OR was marg inally elevated for use of permanent dyes 
that had started in the 1970s (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.98–3.0). 
Zhang et al.  (2004) carried out a case–control study  in Connecticut, USA to evaluate 
the association between hair dyes and risk for NHL among females. A total of 601 cases 
and 717 population controls were included. Th e OR associated with hair-dye use was 1.1 
(95% CI, 0.9–1.5). Additionally, no evidence of a dose-response with the total number of 
applications, duration of use, years since first use, colour or type was observed. However, 
the OR for permanent dark-colour users for mo re than 25 years was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0–4.0) 
and it was 1.2 (95% CI, 0.6–2.1) if the duratio n of use was less than 15 years. Considering 
lifetime dose, those with more than 200 applications had an OR of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0–2.8). 
An increase in risk w as observed for those starting use before 1980 (OR, 1.3; 95% 
CI, 1.0–1.8). By NHL subtypes,  a significant increase in risk was seen for follicular 610 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 lymphoma and B-Cell NHL among women who used permanent hair-colouring products 
(OR for follicular lymphoma, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2; OR for B-cell NHL, 1.6; 95% CI , 1.2–2.3). 
Benavente et al.  (2005) carried out a case–control stud y in Spain to evaluate the risk 
for lymphoma associated with hair-dye exposure. A total of 574 lymphoma cases and 
616 hospital controls were included in the st udy. The prevalence of hair-dye exposure 
was 79% among females and 8% among males.  A non-significant increase in risk was 
observed for ever-use (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9–1.7). No association was observed for colour, type, frequency, or lifetime dose. By specific lymphoma subtypes, a twofold 
increase in risk for ever-use was observed for CL L (95% CI, 1.1–4.7). A significant linear 
trend by years of use was also observed for CLL ( P = 0.04) among those exposed for 10 
years or less (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4–3.0), fr om 11 to 24 years of use (OR, 3.2; 95% 
CI, 1.3–8.2) and for 24 years or more (OR, 3. 7; 95% CI, 1.5–8.9). In  this group of cases, 
those who started hair-dye use before 1980 had a 3.5-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.5–
7.8) compared with non-users. Use of dark colour and permanent hair-dye types were 
both associated with an increased risk for CLL (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1– 4.9 for dark colour 
and OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4–7.8 for permanent). 
Tavani et al.  (2005) carried out a case–control study in northern Italy aimed at 
evaluating the relationship between lympho id neoplasm and tissue sarcoma and use of 
hair dyes. A total of 966 cases and 1295 ho spital controls were interviewed. No 
significant association with hair-dye use w as seen for any of the ly mphoma subtypes. An 
increased risk for multiple myeloma among semi-permanent dye users was observed 
(OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.02–3.12). Information about colour was not included in the study. 
De Sanjosé et al.  (2006) carried out a multicentric case-control study including seven 
countries in Europe. A tota l of 2302 lymphoma cases and 241 7 controls were pooled to 
study the relationship between hair dyes and the risk for lymphoma. A slight increase in 
risk for lymphoma was observed for ever-use of hair dyes (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00–1.41). 
The risk for lymphoma for those starting use before 1980 was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.09–1.72). 
Among all lymphoma categories, a statistically significant increase in risk for CLL was seen (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01–2.03). The risk  for lymphoma increased  with the number 
of years of use of dark hair dyes ( P for linear trend, 0.07): four years or less: OR, 1.11 
(95% CI, 0.84–1.46); from 4.5 to 13 year s: OR, 1.28 (95% CI, 0.96–1.70) and for 14 
years or more: OR, 1.45 (95% CI, 1.09–1.94). This study included the data of Benavente 
et al.  (2005), but sensitivity analysis showed that results were not explained by any of the 
individual studies. 
Morton et al.  (2007) carried out a population -based NHL study in the USA among 
1321 cases and 1057 controls, ex amining NHL risk in relation  to reported hair-dye use 
and genetic variation in NAT1  and NAT2 . No increased in risk was observed for ever-
exposure among either males or females (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9–1.6). The OR for females 
exposed to 100 or more lifetime applications  was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0–2.0). Among females, 
a fourfold increase in risk was observed for those using permanent and intense tones for 
more than 15 years before 1980 (OR,  3.9; 95% CI, 1.2–12.5). Concerning NAT1  and  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 611  
 NAT2  variation, an increase in risk was observed for the use of dark or intense permanent 
hair dyes before 1980 among women if they had the NAT2 rapid/intermediate phenotype (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3–8.6) or if they had one or two copies of the NAT*10  allele 
(OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1–8.1). 
Chiu et al.  (2007) carried out a case–control st udy in Eastern Nebraska (USA) to 
evaluate the relationship between personal us e of hair dyes and the risk for t(14;18)-
defined subtypes of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A total of 385 cases and 1432 population 
controls were interviewed. No relation was ob served for ever-use of hair dyes and the risk 
for NHL for either t(14;18)-negativ e or -positive translocation cases. 
A meta-analysis by Takkouche et al.  (2005) included 40 studies on non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple my eloma. All haematopoietic cancers were 
significantly increased among ever-users of hair  dyes (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06–1.20). The 
combined OR estimated for permanent hair -dye use was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99–1.29) and 
for intensive use it was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.98–1.28). The different sensitivity analyses provided a range of estimates from 0.87 for Hodgkin-lymphoma studies to 1.57 for those 
studies including men only. No evaluation of the period of e xposure was included in this 
analysis. 
(d) Childhood cancer  (see Table 2.11; only studies since 1993 are shown 
in the Table)  
Kramer et al.  (1987) reported a matched case–cont rol study of maternal exposures 
during pregnancy and neuroblastoma diagnosed during the period 1970–1979 in the 
Greater Delaware Valley, USA. Of the 18 1 cases identified, 139 met the eligibility 
criteria, and interviews were completed w ith 104 case families (75%). Control subjects 
were selected by random-digit dialling and were matched wi th cases on age, race and the 
first five digits of their telephone number at the time of diagnosis; the response rate 
among those eligible was 57% (101 of 177). In addition, the authors compared 86 patients who had at least one sibling with a randomly  selected sibling. Moth ers were asked about 
six main exposures, specified  for hypothesis testing, an d about a variety of other 
exposures, including the use of hair-colouring  products. The OR associated with maternal 
exposure to hair dye was 3.00 (90% CI, 1.64–5.48; one-sided  P-value, 0.002; 36

0.93–5.22; one-sided P-value, 0.07; 16 discordant pairs) in comparison with siblings. 
Bunin et al.  (1987) conducted a case–control study of Wilms’ tumour diagnosed in 
children under 15 during the period 1970–1983 in the Greater Philadelphia (USA) area in 
relation to use of hair dyes by their mothers during pregnancy. Of 152 white cases, 28 were ineligible for a variety of reasons. Inte rviews were completed with the parents of 88 
(71%) of the 124 eligible cases and 88 of 159  (55%) controls, on average 10 years after 
the relevant pregnancy. For Wilms tumour over all, the OR associated with maternal hair-
dye use was 3.6 (95% CI, 1.4– 10.2; based on 32 discordant pairs). A total of 68 cases 
could be classified as genetic (26 cases) (if they were bilateral or had nephroblasto-
matosis) or non-genetic (42 cases)  (if they were unilateral wi thout nephroblastomatosis or  612 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 a Wilms tumour-associated congenital anomaly) . The OR associated with maternal use of 
hair-colouring agents was 5.5 (95% CI, 1.0–71.9; on the basis of 13 discordant pairs out of 42) for non-genetic cases and 3.3 (95% CI, 0.7–22.1; on the basis of 13 out of 26 
discordant pairs) for genetic cases. The ORs asso ciated with exposure to hair dyes were 
similar for an interval of 2–10 years a nd for an interval of 11–24 years between 
pregnancy and interview. 
Kuijten et al.  (1990), in an earlier report of the study of Kuijten et al.  (1992), found no 
association between astrocytoma and maternal  use of hair-colou ring produc ts during 
pregnancy (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4–1.8; 37 discordant pairs). 
Olshan et al.  (1993) carried out a case–control study in the USA and Canada using 
the National Wilms Tumor Study to recrui t 200 cases of Wilms tumours to evaluate 
parental exposures during pr egnancy, including hair-colouring pr oducts. Cases were 
matched to 233 controls living in the same neighbourhood and having the same age, 
selected using random-digit di alling. A non-significant in creased risk was observed for 
ever-use of hair dyes during pregnancy (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.66–2.85). There is a 
discrepancy in this paper between the risk estimat ed for cases diagnosed  younger than 
2 years in the Results section  and in the Discussion section (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.16–9.45 
and OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 0.91–9. 33, for Results and Discussion sections, respectively). The 
study had a moderate inclusion rate (61% of the selected cases and 52% of the controls) 
and exposure was assessed by interview. 
Bunin et al.  (1994) carried out a case–control st udy, in the USA and Canada, based 
on the Children’s Cancer Gr oup to evaluate several expo sures occurring during the 
pregnancy and breastfeeding peri ods. The exposures included hair dyes, hair sprays and 
makeup in association with astrocytic glioma ( n = 155) and primitive neuroectodermal 
tumours (PNET) ( n = 166) diagnosed before age 6. Controls ( n = 321) were selected via 
random-digit dialling and matched to the cases by neighbourhood , race and age. No 
association was identified for astrocytoma w ith use of make-up (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7–
1.9), hair spray (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7–2.0), hair colouring (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.3–1.6) or 
use of permanent hair dye (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5–1.5) or for PNET (OR for make–up, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5–1.2; for hairspray, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6–1.7; for hair-colouring 
products, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4–2.6; for permanent hair-dye use 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7.-2.0). The 
analysis was fully adjusted for income leve l for the astrocytoma analysis. Participation 
was around 65%, and exposure was assessed by interview. 
McCredie et al.  (1994) conducted a case–control study of inci dent primary malignant 
brain tumours diagnosed during 1985–1989 in children below 14 years old in Sydney, Australia, and evaluated several hypotheses among which ever-use of hair dyes by the 
mothers. No association was show n (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4–1.6). 
Holly et al.  (2002) carried out a case–control st udy to evaluate childhood brain 
tumours (CBT) and maternal use of hair colouring one month before pregnancy and 
during pregnancy. The study used cancer re gistries from Los Angeles County, the San 
Francisco Bay area and the Seattle area, USA. It included 540 biological mothers of CBT 
children diagnosed during 1984–1991 and 801 control moth ers matched to cases by birth 618 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 year and sex of the index child. Exposure was assessed  through interview. A non-
statistically significant increase in risk was identified for those moth ers using exclusively 
semi-permanent dyes one month before pregnancy or during the first trimester of 
pregnancy (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 0.58–10.0). Exclusive use of permanent dyes, temporary 
dyes or hair darkeners was not related to an increased risk. Exclusive use of semi-
permanent dyes was related to an increased ri sk (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.83–4.7) for users 
before or during pregnancy. No differences by histological tumour type were observed. 
Participation rates were over  70% for cases and controls. 
McCall et al.  (2005) carried out a case–control st udy on neuroblastoma in association 
with exposure to hair-dye use before and during pregnancy. The study recruited 538 cases 
from the USA and Canadian Children’s Cancer Group or the Pediatric Oncology Group. A total of 504 controls were selected usin g telephone random-digit sampling. Controls 
were matched to the cases by sex, year of birth and neighbourhood . Participation rates 
were over 70% for both cases and controls. Use of temporary hair dyes was associated with a twofold increased risk for neuroblastom a (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.7). Use of hair 
dyes in the month before pregnancy showed  a 60% increase in risk (OR, 1.6; 95% 
CI, 1.2–2.2). Ever smokers were more likely to have an increased risk for neuroblastoma 
in their offspring if mothers used hair dyes (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.8) or permanent dyes 
(OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2–4.1). No dose-resp onses were reported for permanent dyes. 
Chen et al.  (2006) reported a case–control study that explored the association between 
childhood germ-cell tumours and hair-dye use by the mother before and during pregnancy 
and during breastfeeding, among 273 cases di agnosed between 1993 and 2001 from the 
Children’s Oncology Group in the USA. A total of 418 controls were selected via 
random-digit dialling and matched to th e cases by sex, age and geographical area. 
Maternal use of hair dyes one month before pregnancy was related to a 1.7-fold increased 
risk for boys (95% CI, 1.0–2.8). For mothers who used hair dyes during breastfeeding the overall OR was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0–2.2) and 1.7 among girls (95% CI, 1.1–2.6). 
(e) Other cancer sites 
Ahlbom et al.  (1986) carried out a case–control study in St ockholm and Uppsala, 
Sweden, of 78 patients with astrocytoma diagnosed in 1980–1981, 197 hospital controls 
(with meningioma, pituitary adenoma or cerebral aneurysm) and 92 population controls. 
The ORs for the 23 astrocytoma patients who had dyed their hair were 0.8 (95% CI, 0.4–1.8) relative to 83 hospital controls and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.6–3.7) when compared with 
46 population controls who had dyed their hair. 
Burch et al.  (1987) found that significantly more adults with brain cancer diagnosed 
in Canada in 1977–1981 than hospital controls re ported having used hair dye or hair spray 
(OR, 1.96; P = 0.013; 43/22 discordant pairs). No data by histology were provided, but 
133 of 215 were astrocytomas and 67 of 215 had a glioma or related histology. 
Heineman et al.  (2005) evaluated the risk for glioma in the female white population 
of Nebraska associated to use of hair dy es. Cases were diagnosed between 1988 and 
1993, and controls were retrieved from a previous study, were population-based and were  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 619  
 matched to the case by age. Adjustment by y ear of birth and educational level was done 
throughout the study. Questions about exposu res from hair-dye use before 1985 were 
assessed by personal or proxy interview (79%  of the cases). The study identified an 
increased risk for glioma for ever-use of hair  dye (OR, 1.7; 95% CI , 1.0–2.9) and a 2.4-
fold risk from use of permanent hair dyes (95% CI, 1.3–4.5). The risk for glioblastoma 
multiforme increased 4.9-fold (95%  CI, 1.6–15.7) with exposure  to dark colours for those 
reporting use during 20 years or less. 
Bluhm et al.  (2007) explored the association between use of synthetic hair dyes and 
risk for brain tumours in a hospital-based case–control study, includ ing 489 patients with 
glioma, 197 with meningioma, 96 with acoustic neuroma, and 799 controls. The study, 
carried out in 1994–19 98, identified no incr ease in risk for these tumours from ever-use 
among exposed women or exposed men, including in evaluations of frequency, lifetime 
number of doses, or colour. There was only  one positive associati on linked to use of 
brown colour for more than 20 years for all glioma cases and use of red colour during less 
than 20 years. Both ORs were stronger for acoustic neuroma. [The Working Group was 
concerned about data stratification resulting in very small numbers and high ORs] 
A meta-analysis by Takkouche et al.  (2005) included 15 studies on a wide range of 
cancer sites other than breast, bladder or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The pooled RR was 
1.83 (95% CI, 1.16–2.89) for brain cancer; 1.71 (95% CI, 1.15–2.53) for ovarian cancer; 
0.74 (95% CI, 0.51–1.07) for skin cancer; and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.53–1.90) for cervical cancer. 
Stavraky et al.  (1981), in a case–control study, foun d no significant increase in crude 
or adjusted risks for cancer of the cervix (38 cases), cancer of the ovary (58 cases), cancer 
of the lung (70 cases), cancers of the kidney and bladder (35 cases) or endometrial 
cancers (36 cases) among ever-users of hair-col ouring agents in either Toronto or 
London, Ontario, Canada. 
Holman & Armstrong (1983) examined hair-dye use in a population-based case–
control study of 511 patients with malignant melanoma and individually matched controls 
in Western Australia in 1980–1981. No relationship was found with ever-use of 
permanent hair dyes. The ORs obtained from a conditional logistic regression analysis 
with adjustment for solar exposure, reaction to sunlight and hair colour (Armstrong & 
Holman, 1985) for 86 cases of Hutchinson's melanotic freckle associated with use of 
semi-permanent and temporary dyes were: never used, 1.00; used 1–9 times, 1.5 (95% CI, 
0.3–6.8); used ≥ 10 times, 3.3 (95% CI, 1.0–11.5; P for trend, 0.05). The OR for 
Hutchinson’s melanotic freckle in relation to  use of permanent dyes was not elevated. 
[The Working Group noted that the number of exposed subjects was not reported.] 
Osterlind et al.  (1988a,b) found a negative associatio n with use of permanent or semi-
permanent hair dyes among women with malignant melanoma in Denmark in 1982–1985 (OR for hair dye use, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5– 0.9; 136 exposed cases). Cases of Hutchinson’s 
melanotic freckle were not include d in this population-based study. 
Spitz et al.  (1990) examined hair dye use in a case–control study of 37 male and 
27 female patients with salivary gland cancer  in Texas, USA, in the period 1985–1989. 620 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Controls were patients with other malignancies. Among ever-users of hair dyes, an 
increased OR was found for women (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.5–11.5; 14 cases). There was no 
difference between female cases and controls with  respect to frequency of use, except that 
the OR for use during more than 15 years (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 0.9–12.8) was higher than 
that for shorter duration of u se (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.9–6.2). 
2.2.3  Pooled analysis  (Tables 2.12–2.16)  
A recent analysis (Zhang et al. , 2008) pooled original data from four previously 
reported case–control studies that were part  of the International Lymphoma Epidemiology 
Consortium (InterLymph), including a total of 4461 NHL cases (2123 men and 
2338 women) and 5799 controls (2837 men and 2962 women) to investigate the relationship between personal hair-dye use and risk for NHL. Three studies were from 
the USA, the Connecticut Women’s NHL St udy, the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI)/Surveillance, Epidemio logy, and End Results (SEER ) MultiCenter Case-Control 
Study (NCI/SEER), and the Epidemiology of NHL Study from the University of 
California at San Francisco (UCSF). The three US studies collectivel y represent a total of 
six sites from the SEER programme (Connec ticut, San Francisco-Oakland, Iowa, Detroit, 
Seattle-Puget Sound, and Los Angeles). The ot her case–control study, from Europe (the 
EpiLymph International Case-Control Study of Lymphomas), represents geographic sites 
from six countries (Czech Republic, France, Ge rmany, Ireland, Italy,  and Spain). Each 
study collected detailed information on hair-dye use (including duration of use, total 
number of applications, year of use, and type and colour of hair-dye) and included 
histologically-confirmed incident NHL cases. Among women, 75% of the cases and 70% of the controls reported ever having used  hair dyes. An increased risk for NHL was 
observed among women who started using hair dyes before 1980, compared with non-
users (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4). After stratification by NHL subtype, hair-dye use was associated with an increased ri sk for follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) but not other NHL subtypes. The 
increased risk for FL (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1. 1–1.9) and CLL/SLL (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–
2.0) associated with hair-dye use was mainly observed among women who started use 
before 1980, with a significant tren d in risk with duration of use ( P < 0.01, 0.02 
respectively). For women who began using the products in 1980 or later, a higher risk for FL was limited to users of dark-coloured hair dyes (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.0) with ORs 
of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1–2.1) for permanent dark-coloured hair dyes and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1–
2.4) for non-permanent dark-coloured dy es. Among men, approximately 10% of cases 
and 10% of controls had ever used hair dyes.  Risk for NHL was not associated with hair-
dye use before or after 1980 among men. The results indicate that personal hair-dye use 
may play a role in the risk for FL and CLL/SLL in women who started use before 1980, and that an increased risk for FL in women starting use in 1980 or later cannot be 
excluded.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 621

3.1 Occupational use of hair dyes: Hair -dye formulations and some of their 
components 
3.1.1  Skin application 
(a) Mouse  
Groups of 50 male and 50 female Swiss Webster mice, 6–8 weeks of age, received 
applications of one of three oxidation (permanent) hair-dye formulations, PP-7588, 
PP-7586 or PP-7585 (all three contained 2,5-toluenediamine sulfate, para-phenylene-
diamine and resorcinol; PP-7586 also contai ned 2,4-diaminoanisole sulfate, PP-7585 
contained meta-phenylenediamine, and PP-7588 cont ained 2,4-toluene-diamine) [see 
reference for additional details on composition], mixed with an equal volume of 6% 
hydrogen peroxide just before use; 0.05 mL of the mixture in acetone was applied to the shaved skin of the interscap ular region. Controls were given acetone or were left 
untreated. For each formulation and for the vehicle control,  one group was treated once 
weekly and another group once every other week for 18 months. Survival at 18 months varied from 58% to 80%. No sign of systemic toxicity was found in any of the dye-treated 
groups. Average body weights were comparab le in all groups throughout the study. The 
incidence of tumours at all sites, including lung tumours, was not statistically different 
between treated and control groups. No skin tumours were observed at the site of 
application (Burnett et al. , 1975). 
The chronic toxicity of 2,4- toluenediamine (2,4-TDA) alon e [purity not specified] or 
in combination with a hair-dye complex (2,5-toluenediamine, para-phenylenediamine, 
and resorcinol) [see reference fo r additional details on compos ition] was studied in groups 
of 28 male and 28 female Swiss Webster mi ce, 4–7 weeks of age, and weighing 15–20 g 
by use of a skin-painting tech nique, whereby a 6% solution of the study materials in a 
water/isopropanol solvent were mixed with equal volumes of either 6% peroxide or 
distilled water at doses of 50, 150 or 1500 μg 2,4-TDA per week. Additional groups of 
vehicle and untreated controls were used. No  information on surviv al was provided. The 
predominant neoplasms seen in these mice were primary pulmonary adenomas and 
adenocarcinomas. Skin neoplasm s were seen in most groups of mice, including untreated 
controls. Statistical analysis of the incidences of skin neoplasms among the various 
groups of mice did not show any significant differences. The 2,4-TDA, alone or mixed 
with the hair-dye complex, did not produce any abnormal proliferation and maturation of the squamous epithelium  of the skin (Giles et al. , 1976). [The Working Group noted the 
lack of information on surv ival, and the use of water as the skin-painting solvent.] 
Groups of 26 male and 22 female DBAf an d 26 male and 26 female strain-A mice, 6–
7 weeks of age, received skin applications of  0.4 mL (reduced to 0.2 mL at 24 weeks for  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 631  
 DBAf mice) of a 10% solution of a comme rcially available semi-permanent hair dye 
(‘GS’), containing, among other constituents [unspecified], 1,4-diamino-2-nitrobenzene (2-nitro- para-phenylene-diamine) and 1,2-diamino-4-nitrobenzene (4-nitro- ortho -
phenylenediamine) in 50% aqueous acetone tw ice a week on the clipped dorsal skin. 
Groups of 16 male and 16 female control mice of each strain received applications of 
acetone alone. When the experiment was termin ated at 80 weeks, four (18%) lymphomas 
and six (27%) tumours of the reproductive tract (four ovarian cystadenomas and two 
uterine fibrosarcomas) had developed in th e 22 treated female DBAf mice within 37–
80 weeks, and one (4%) lymphoma had developed by week 26 among the 26 treated 
males. In control DBAf mice, 1 lymphoma and 1 lung adenoma were found in females 
and 1 hepatoma in males. No difference was observed in the incidence of lymphomas or 
liver or lung tumours between treated and control strain-A mice. No skin tumour at the 
site of application was observed in either strain. Of the treated animals, 27 DBAf mice 
and 32 strain-A mice survived  60–80 weeks without tumours (Searle & Jones, 1977). 
[The Working Group noted that this study was conducted with a low concentration of the 
formulation used in this study.] 
In the same study, groups of 17 male and 15 female DBAf and 16 male and 16 female 
strain-A mice, 6–7 weeks of ag e, received skin applications of 0.4 mL (reduced to 0.2 mL 
at 24 weeks for DBAf mice) of a 10% so lution of a commercially available semi-
permanent hair dye (“RB”), containing, among other constituents [unspecified], 4-amino-2-nitrophenol and CI Acid Black 107, in  50% aqueous acetone twice a week on the 
clipped dorsal skin. The experiment was te rminated at 80 weeks. No significant 
difference was observed in the incidence of tumours at any site between treated and control animals of either strain, and no skin tu mour at the site of application was observed 
in either strain (Searle & Jones, 1977). [The Working Group noted the low concentration 
of the formulation used in this study.] 
In an interim report of the Searle and Jones (1977) study mentioned above, it was 
noted that the tumours arose consistently earlie r in the treated than in the control mice, 
notably in the DBAf strain, in which the fi rst lymphoma was detected after 26 weeks. 
Apart from the early appearance, there was al so an increased tumour  incidence in this 
strain, due mainly to uterine and ovarian tum ours that were not seen in the control group 
(Venitt & Searle, 1976). 
Twelve groups of 50 male and 50 female random-bred Swiss Webster mice, 6–
8 weeks of age, were exposed dermally, once per week for 21–23 months, to different 
hair-dye formulations by placing a 0.05-mL sample on a 1-cm
2 area of the interscapular 
region, which had been clipped free of hair 24  hours before treatment. Nine oxidative hair 
dyes (7401, 7402, 7403, 7404, 7405, 7406, P-21, P-25, and P-26) were mixed with an 
equal volume of 6% hydrogen peroxide and 0.025 ml was applied within 15 minutes. Three semi-permanent hair-dye formulations (P-22, P-23, and P-24) were applied in 0.05 
ml within 30 minutes after opening the bottle. In an earlier study, the composition of these 
hair-dye formulations was given in an extensive table (Burnett et al. , 1976). Three groups 
of 50 males and 50 females served as controls that had their backs shaved but were not 632 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 further treated. After seven and nine months, groups of 10 females and 10 males were 
randomly selected from each group, necropsied and examined by histopathology. The experiment was terminated after 21–23 months. The treatments had no effect on survival. 
The incidences of skin tumours and liver a nd lung lymphomas were not greater than in 
control mice (Burnett et al. , 1980). 
Groups of 60 male and 60 female Swiss Webster mice, eight weeks of age, received 
topical applications of two oxidative and 12 non-oxidative hair-dye formulations supplied 
by five cosmetic companies. The composition of the hair-dye formul ations was described. 
Two groups of 60 male and 60 female Swiss Webster mice served as controls. Each 
oxidative formulation was applied at 0.05 mL/mouse once weekly for 20 months. Each 
non-oxidative dye was applied at  a dose of 0.05 mL per mou se three times weekly for 20 
months. The mice were shaved 24 hours be fore treatment as needed. Control animals 
were shaved only and received no treatment. The application of hair  dyes did not have an 
adverse effect on average body-weight gain or survival of any group. There was no 
significant increase in the incidence of malignant lymphomas in male mice or in liver 
hemangiomas or lung adenomas of both sexes in these studies. Significant increases in 
numbers of malignant lymphomas over those in one of the untreated control groups were observed in female mice in the hair dye-formulation groups treated with formulation 
7602A (19/60 (32%) treated vs 7/60 (12%) control, P < 0.01), formulation 7605 (18/60 
(30%) treated vs 7/60 (12%) control, P < 0.05) and formulation 7610 (23/60 (38%) 
treated vs 7/60 (12%) control, P < 0.01). The authors pointed out that the incidence in 
each treated group is not significantly differ ent from the incidence in the second control 
group in this study, and is within the range of control values previously reported for this strain of mouse. They concluded that these tumours were probably not treatment-related 
(Jacobs et al. , 1984). 
(b) Rat 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female Sprague -Dawley rats, approximately 14 weeks of 
age, received topical applicatio ns of 0.5 mL of permanent hair-dye mixtures containing 
[purity unspecified] either 4% para- toluenediamine or 3% para-toluenediamine, 0.75% 
resorcinol and 0.75% meta- diaminoanisole in vehicle solution (4% Tylose HT, 0.5% 
sodium sulfite, 8.5–13% ammonia (25%), 3.7% ammonium sulfate or as formed by 
neutralization and deionized water to 100. 0%), with 6% hydrogen peroxide added 
immediately before use on a 3-cm
2 area of shaved dorsal skin twice a week for two years. 
The animals were then observed for a further six months. Control groups of 25 males and 
25 females of the same strain and age receive d topical applications of 0.5 mL vehicle 
alone, to which 6% hydrogen peroxide was added immediately before use. Another group 
of 50 males and 50 females of the same strain served as untreated controls. No difference 
in survival was observed between treated, ve hicle control and untreated control groups. 
The skin at the application site, and the liver,  kidney, lung and gross lesions were studied 
histologically. No skin tumour  was observed at the site of application, and there was no  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 633  
 significant difference in the in cidence of tumours, including those of the skin, between 
treated, vehicle control and untreated control groups (Kinkel & Holzmann, 1973). 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female Wistar  rats weighing 120–140 g received topical 
applications of 0.5 mL oxidized para-phenylenediamine [purity unspecified] (1:1 mixture 
of 5% para-phenylenediamine and 2% ammonium hydroxide) and 6% hydrogen 
peroxide on shaved dorsal skin once a week for 18 months. Control rats were shaved and 
treated with the corresponding vehicle. Treated and control groups did not differ 
significantly in body weight gain or survival. All surviving rats were killed after 21 months. Treated rats had a significantly in creased incidence of mammary tumours (5/10 
(50%); P < 0.05 [incidental tumour test]) in comparison with female vehicle-controls 
(0/9). The first mammary tumour observed was a fibrosarcoma, which occurred at week 47; the others were three adenomas and one fibroadenoma. No skin tumour was observed 
at the site of application (Rojanapo et al. , 1986). 
Groups of 60 male and 60 female Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 6–8 weeks) received 
topical applications of an oxidative hair-dye formulation (7406) containing 0.5% 
2-amino-5-nitrophenol, 4.0% para-phenylenediamine, 0.7% para-aminophenol, 2.0% 
4-chlororesorcinol, 5.0% oleic acid, 15.0% isopropanol, 0.2% sodium sulfite, 6.0% ammonia and water to 100%. The formulation was diluted in an equal volume of 6% 
hydrogen peroxide before application, and 0.5 mL were applied to a shaved area of the 
back (approx. 2.5 cm in diameter) twice a w eek up to week 117. Th ree separate, similarly 
treated, concurrent control groups of 60 rats received applications of the vehicle alone. 
Mean body weights and survival were similar in treated and control groups. No skin 
tumours were observed. The incidence of pi tuitary adenomas was increased in females in 
comparison with all three control groups (45/51 (88%) vs 34/50 (65%), 36/51 (71%) and 
35/50 (70%); P < 0.05, χ
2-test). The incidence of mammary gland adenomas was 
increased in comparison with one control group (6/53 (11%) vs 0/49; P < 0.05, χ2-test). 
The authors concluded that the tumours were probably not treatment-related (Burnett & 
Goldenthal, 1988). 
In the same study, groups of 60 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, 6–8 weeks of 
age, received topical applications of an oxid ative hair-dye formulation (7405) containing 
0.4% 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, 6.0% 2,5-diaminoanisole sulfate, 2.0% resorcinol, 0.3% 
ortho -aminophenol, 5.0% oleic acid, 3.0% isopropanol, 0.2% sodium sulfite, 6.0% 
ammonia (29%) and water to 100%. The formulation was diluted in an equal volume of 
6% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.5 mL was applied to a shaved area of the back (approx. 
2.5 cm in diameter) twice a week up to week 117. Mean body weights and survival were 
similar in treated and control groups. No skin tumours were observed. The incidence of 
pituitary adenomas was increased in males in comparison with one of the control groups 
35/52 (67%) vs 14/49; P < 0.01; χ2-test), and no incr ease in the inciden ce of tumours at 
any other site was observed in treated rats compared with control animals. The authors 
concluded that the tumours were probably not treatment-related (Burnett & Goldenthal, 
1988). 634 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 In the same study, groups of 60 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, 6–8 weeks of 
age, received topical applications of an oxid ative hair-dye formulation (7403) containing 
6.0% para-toluenediamine sulfate, 0.7% meta -aminophenol, 1.0% para-aminophenol, 
0.25% 4-nitro- ortho -phenylene diamine, 0.50% 1-naphtol, 15% oleic acid, 10% 
isopropanol, 4.5% glycerine, 9.0% propylene glycol, 0.2% sodium sulphite, 9.0% ammonia and water to 100%. The formulation was diluted in an equal volume of 6% 
hydrogen peroxide before application, and 0.5 mL was applied to a shaved area of the 
back (approx. 2.5 cm in diameter) twice a w eek until week 117. Mean body weights and 
survival were similar in treated and control groups. The incidence of mammary gland 
adenomas was increased in comparison w ith one control gr oup (10/52 (19%) vs 0/49; 
P < 0.01, χ
2-test). There was no significant increase in the incidence of tumours at any 
site, and no skin tumour was observed. The authors concluded that the tumours were 
probably not treatment-related (Burnett & Goldenthal, 1988). [The Working Group 
wondered why the tumours were assu med not to be treatment-related.] 
3.1.2  Subcutaneous injection 
(a) Rat 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats weighing 120–140 g received subcutaneous 
injections of 0.5 mL oxidized para-phenylenediamine (5% para-phenylenediamine in 2% 
ammonium hydroxide and 1.8% sodium chloride) in an equal volume of 6% hydrogen 
peroxide in the hip area every other week for 18 months. Controls were injected similarly with vehicle only. There was no significant di fference between treated and control groups 
in body-weight gain or survival. All survivors were killed after 21 months. The incidence 
of mammary lesions [duct ectasia or adenosis ] was significantly increased (4/7 (57%); 
P < 0.05 incidental tumour test) in females in comparison with vehi cle controls (0/10). 
Two uterine tumours, an adenocarcinoma and an endometrial polyp were observed in 
females; no such tumours were observed in  controls. Two sarcomas [not otherwise 
classified] at the injection site and two lipo mas were also observed in treated animals 
(Rojanapo et al. , 1986). [The Working Group noted the small number of animals used in 
this study.]

old) and 36 control subjects matched for age and sex (17 men, 28.1 ± 7.3 years old; 
19 women, 25.3 ± 6.5 years old) (Kirkland et al. , 1978) in the United Kingdom. 
Information was recorded on smoking habits, alcohol consumption, medical history, use of medicinal drugs and drugs of abuse, infections, vaccinations and exposure to X-rays. 
Details of occupational exposure to hair dy es were also collected: women had done an 
average of 11 000 permanent and 5000 semipermanent hair-tinting operations and men had done 15 000 permanent and 6000 semi-permanent operations, over periods ranging 
from 1 to 15 years. Blood samples were taken at the time of interview, but the time since 
the last hair-tint application (to themselves or clients) was not recorded. Among the chromosomal aberrations, more gaps were found per cell among female tinters than in 
controls (0.065 vs 0.048; P < 0.02) but not among male tinters (0.064 vs 0.063). The 
number of breaks per cell (assumed from the observed aberrations) was not altered among women (0.028 vs 0.031) but was lower among men (0.034 vs 0.047; P < 0.05). After 
exclusion of subjects exposed to high doses of diagnostic X-rays or who recently had viral 
infections these differences di sappeared (breaks in tinters vs controls: women, 0.023 vs 
0.027; men, 0.036 vs 0.038). Reallocation of this sm aller set of subjects according to 
whether or not their own hair was dyed rev ealed that the number of breaks per cell was 
higher among women who dyed their hair (dyed vs not dyed, 0.031 vs 0.018; P < 0.02) 
and lower among men who dyed their hair (0.023 vs 0.044; P < 0.01). The women had 
given themselves an average of 90 permanent and 10 semi-permanent tints and the men 
an average of 30 permanent tints [semi-pe rmanent tints not indicated] over a period 
similar to their occupational exposure. The authors stated that th ere was no association 
between chromosomal damage and the duration and/or frequency of hair dyeing in the 
women. [The Working Group noted the absence of  data to substantiate this statement.] 
They reported that 20/23 female and 11/18 male tinters wore protective gloves for all 
applications of permanent a nd semi-permanent hair tints and deduced that most of the 
subjects would receive greater exposure to hair-dye components when their own hair was treated. The finding that the number of breaks per cell was lower among men who dyed 
their hair than among those who did not was explained by the age difference between the 
group with tinted hair (22.7 ± 5.1 years, n = 10) and the group with non-tinted hair 
(31.8 ± 10.1, n = 17). Kirkland et al.  (1978) based their argument on the observation of 
Brown et al.  (1965) that there was much  less chromosomal damage of all types in 48-hour 
blood cultures from men aged 15–24 than from men aged 25–34, whereas there was no 
difference among women in these age ranges. 636 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Babish et al. , (1991) conducted a study in New Yo rk State, USA, on cosmetologists 
(91 women, 7 men) who were occupationally exposed to a wide range of chemicals, including hair dyes, and who had reported a pr evalence of skin rashes that was twice as 
high as that of a control group of 87 female dental personnel (29% vs 15%). The two 
groups were matched for median age, smoking status and proportion of subjects (13–16%) who had had their hair permed or dyed within seven days of the study. At the end of 
a normal working day, subjects from each group provided a urine sample, which was later 
concentrated and tested for mutagenicity in S. typhimurium  TA100 in the presence and 
absence of S9. In the presence of S9, there was no difference between the groups, but in 
tests conducted without S9 the frequency of mutagenic urine samples was 15% higher 
among cosmetologists (39%) than among dental personnel (24%). Multivariate analysis, with adjustment for age and smoking habits, revealed an OR of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.1–3.8) for 
the presence of urinary mutagens in cosmetolog ists compared with dental personnel. [The 
Working Group noted the inadequate reporting of the results.] 
Sardaş et al.  (1997) assessed the cytogenic effect s of occupational exposure to 
oxidation hair dyes by using three assays in professional hair colourists. The assays were 
analysis of sister chromatid exchange (SCE ) in circulating lymphocytes to evaluate the 
interchange of DNA-replication products at  apparently homologous chromosomal loci, 
the single-cell gel electroph oresis assay to detect the presence of DNA strand-
breaks/alkali-labile damage, and the Ames assay with Salmonella typhimurium  strain 
TA98 to detect the mutagenicity of the urine.  The ability of these assays to detect genetic 
damage caused by oxidation hair dyes compared with closely matched controls produced 
the following findings: (i) The SCE assay could not detect an effect in lymphocytes of 
exposed subjects from whom complete data we re obtained. However, subjects (controls 
and exposed) with a history of smoking had a slightly higher frequency of SCE than the 
non-smokers in both groups. (ii) The extent of DNA migration (single-cell gel electrophoresis assay) did not distinguish betw een the samples of exposed and control 
subjects. Like the SCE results, the exposed  smokers and control smokers showed a 
greater proportion of damaged lymphocytes with apparent change in migration of DNA in the single-cell gel electrophor esis assay. (iii) No clear differences in the mutagenic 
activity of the urine samples were observed between the exposed and control subjects. 
 (b) Experimental systems 
Wang et al.  (1991) showed that of 169 commercial oxidative-type (hydrogen 
peroxide) hair-dye formulations, 150 (89%) were mutagenic in the Salmonella  
mutagenicity assay. Of the 18 components of these hair dyes, nine showed various 
degrees of mutagenicity: 2,4-diaminoanisole, 4-nitro- ortho -phenylenediamine, 2-nitro-
para-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminoanisole, 2-amino-5-nitrophenol, meta-phenylene-
diamine, ortho -phenylenediamine, 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, and 2,5-diaminotoluene. Three 
hair-dye components ( para-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminotoluene and 2,5-diamino-
anisole) became strongly mutagenic after oxidation by hydrogen peroxide: the mutagenic 
product of para-phenylenediamine was identified as th e known trimer Bandrowski's base.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 637  
 [The Working Group considered formation of this mutagenic product unlikely to happen 
under practical hair-dyeing conditions.] 2,4-Diaminotoluene, a hair-dye component, was also mutagenic: this compound has been shown to be a carcinogen in rats and is used in 
large amounts in the polyurethane-foam industry. [The Working Group noted that this 
compound has been taken off the market in the early 1970s] (Ames et al. , 1975). 
A total of 13 commercial hair-dye prod ucts made in China were tested for 
mutagenicity in two short-term assays, the Salmonella typhimurium  mutagenicity test in 
strains TA98 and TA100 and the in-vivo mi cronucleus assay with mouse bone-marrow 
polychromatic erythrocytes. The results showed that the 13 hair dyes were not mutagenic 
in strains TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 . In the micronucleus test, no effect was 
observed (Wang et al. , 1991). 
Albano et al.  (1982) found that of 25 commercial permanent hair-dye formulations 
containing para-phenylenediamine, resorcinol and aminophenols incubated with 
hydrogen peroxide, 12 were mutagenic to S. typhimurium  TA98 only in the presence of 
S9. Without the addition of hydrogen peroxi de, mutagenicity was reduced for three dyes 
and disappeared for three others. Four of six formula tions, with degrees of mutagenicity 
varying from zero to high, administered topically with 3% hydrogen peroxide to male rats, induced urine that was mutagenic to S. typhimurium  TA98 in the presence of S9. 
Ferguson et al.  (1990) tested 40 products, chosen from among 12 brands of 
commercially available hair colourants u sed in New Zealand, for mutagenicity in 
S. typhimurium  TA98 and TA100 without S9; activators were added when recommended. 
Twenty-three of these products were mutage nic in one or both strains. When 10 
mutagenic hair-dye preparations were tested in the presence of the drug verapamil, used for treating cardiac conditions (Ferguson & Baguley, 1988), the mutagenic activity of four 
was decreased and that of two was increased (Ferguson et al. , 1990). 
Watanabe et al.  (1990) found that two of four commercial hair-dye formulations 
containing phenylenediamines and aminophenols (two of which also contained 
2,5-diaminophenol), when oxidized with 6% hydrogen peroxide, were mutagenic to 
S. typhimurium  TA98 in the presence of Kanechlor 500-induced S9. When toxicity was 
reduced by adsorbing bacteric idal products on blue rayon, peroxide treatment increased 
the mutagenicity of all preparations to diff erent extents; in the two preparations with 
markedly increased mutageni city, activity was attributed to the oxidation of 
meta -phenylenediamine to 2,7-diaminophenazine, itself a potent mutagen. 
Ammenheuser and Warren (1979) applied two commercial oxidative hair-colouring 
products at 10–30 mL, both with and without hydrogen peroxide, to the backs of male Sprague-Dawley rats [number unspecified]. Both colourants contained 1,4-diamino-2-
nitrobenzene and 1,2-diamino-4-nitrobenzene (4-nitro- ortho -phenylenediamine). The 
solutions were left on the hair for 20 min and then removed by shampooing and rinsing. Urine was collected before and every 24 hours after product application for four days and 
tested on S. typhimurium  TA1538, the volumes of urine applied to each plate varying 
from 3.4 to 11.5% of the total volume. Urine samples collected during the first 24 hours from rats treated with either of the preparations were mutagenic (two to three times 638 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 background); no significant mutagenicity w as observed in urine samples collected two to 
four days after application. Pr ior reaction with hydrogen peroxi de had little or no effect on 
the mutagenicity of the urine. 
Stamberg et al.  (1979) tested henna and its active colouring ingredient, 2-hydroxy-
1,4-naphthoquinone, for mutagenicity in S. typhimurium  TA98, TA100, TA1535, 
TA1537 and TA1538. Henna was not mutagenic to any strain, but 2-hydroxy-1,4-
naphthoquinone was mutagenic to TA 98, in the absence  of S9 only. 
Matsuki et al.  (1981) isolated 2-amino-5-methoxy-2´(or 3 ′)-methylindamine and 
2-amino-5-methoxy-2´(or 3 ′)-methylindoaniline from an oxidative reaction mixture of 
2,5-diaminotoluene and 2,4-di aminotoluene. These compounds were found to be highly 
mutagenic to S. typhimurium  TA98 in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system. 
Burnett et al.  (1981), in a study of heritable translocation, painted groups of 25 male 
Sprague-Dawley CD rats twice weekly for 10  weeks on the shaved dorsal skin with 
0.5 mL of a semi-permanent dye formulation (comprising base ingred ients plus 0.12% CI 
Disperse Blue 1, 0.04% CI Disperse Black 9, 0.01% HC Red No. 3, 0.21% HC Yellow 
No. 3, 0.50% HC Blue No. 1, 0.06% Acid Orange No. 3, 0.07% CI Disperse Violet 
No. 11 and 0.01% HC Yellow No. 2), or with 0.5 mL of an oxidative dye formulation (comprising base ingredients plus 2.2% para-phenylenediamine, 3.1% N,N-bis(2- 
hydroxyethyl)- para-phenylenediamine sulfate, 1.0% resorcinol and meta -aminophenol, 
mixed 1:1 with 6% hydrogen peroxide just before use). The animals were then mated with untreated female rats. Male F
1 progeny were subsequently mated with other 
untreated females, and the resulting pregnanci es were arrested at day 16 of gestation. No 
difference in average litter size or frequency of successful matings at the F 1 mating was 
seen between controls and the two exposed grou ps. Furthermore, there was no effect on 
the number of live fetuses, implan tations or resorptions at the F 2 (total litters analysed: 
275 controls, 261 in the oxidation dye group and 271 in the semi-permanent dye group). 
4.2.2  Personal use of hair dyes 
Hofer et al.  (1983) studied chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes from six women 
and four men who volunteered to have their hair dyed and a similar group of 10 controls 
matched for age (men: hair-dyed, 35.7 ± 6.7; controls, 30.8 ± 6.4; women: hair-dyed, 
30.3 ± 5.7; controls, 35.0 ± 5.8). Records were taken of smoking habits, alcohol consumption and medical drug use and, during  the experiment, exposure to X-rays, illness 
and vaccinations. There were more smokers in the test group. None of the volunteers had 
used hair dyes or shades for at least one year  before entering the study, and the control 
group did not use hair colourants during the study. The treated group had their hair dyed 
13 times at intervals of three to six week s with commercial preparations containing 
mixtures of aminotoluenes, aminophenols and hydroxybenzenes and, in some cases, 
naphthol, as active ingredients; the colourin g product used was chosen according to each 
subject’s hair colour, and the same material was used throughout th e study. The colouring 
preparations were mixed (1:1) with 3–6% hydrogen peroxide. Nine blood samples were  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 639  
 taken: three weeks before the first treatm ent (control sample), 24 hours after a sham 
dyeing (no dye or hydrogen peroxide) and 24 hours after each of the first three and last 
four dyeing procedures. No difference w as observed between the control and treated 
groups in the percentage of cells with one or  more structural aberrations (excluding gaps) 
before treatment, after sham-dyeing or after treatment. Subdivision of the groups according to sex revealed no difference. A sign ificant increase in aberration rate with age 
was observed among the male but not the female subjects. Neither smoking nor X-ray 
exposure had an effect. In conjunction with this study, sister chromatid exchange was 
examined in peripheral lympho cytes; no evidence w as found of an effect on the frequency 
(Turanitz et al. , 1983). 
Kirkland et al.  (1981) studied sister chromatid  exchange in the peripheral 
lymphocytes of a small group of volunt eers comprising 13 women and one man 
immediately before and 6 hours and seven days after one normal application of four semi-
permanent and 10 permanent hair dyes, all of which were mutagenic to Salmonella 
typhimurium  TA1538 and TA98 in the presence of  metabolic activation. There was no 
consistent increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchange per cell. 
In a study in the USA involving 30  women aged 45–65 years, Burnett et al. , (1979) 
determined mutagenicity in urine specimens collected before and during a 24-hour period 
immediately after application of dark shades of several hair-colouring products containing 
high levels of dyes and dye intermediates. Many of the women had used hair dyes regularly for over 20 years. Concentrated  (XAD-2 resin) urine samples did not increase 
the number of reverse mutations in S. typhimurium  TA1538 in the presence of an 
exogenous metabolic system from rat liver (S9). [The Working Group noted the inadequate reporting of the results.] 
Espinoza et al.  (2008) evaluated micronuclei in urothelial cells to determine the 
possible association between genetic damage an d use of hair dyes in 128 Spanish women. 
In addition, 72 women who participated as controls in a bladder cancer case–control study 
in Spain were included as controls. To avoid any kind of bias, only those cells with a 
typical morphology corresponding to the ur othelial cells were scored. The mean 
micronucleus frequency in the overall study group was 9.72 ± 0.82 micronclei/1000 cells 
and did not vary by hair-dye exposure: 9.90 micronuclei/1000 cells (± 0.78) observed in 
women using hair dyes during the preceding month vs 9.50 micronuclei/1000 cells 
(± 2.45) observed in women who did not use hair dye in the preceding month. Use of hair 
dyes in recent months was associated with a higher frequency of micronuclei, but the 
association was not statis tically significant ( P = 0.536). 
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
Hair dyes are difficult to evaluate as a grou p. On the one hand, the exposure situation 
is different for hairdressers and personal user s, and on the other hand it seems particularly 
difficult to obtain informati on about a causal relationship. Significant associations can 
hardly be expected from epidemiological in vestigations. The expe rience with aromatic 640 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 amines somehow directed the attention from the beginning towards genotoxicity, and 
towards the bladder as the target tissue. Si nce bladder tumours are not uncommon in the 
general population, one would expect the tum our incidence to increa se significantly only 
if exposures to hair dye-derived agents are re latively high, i.e. significantly above the 
background of other “bladd er-specific” agents, for inst ance from smoking. Moreover, 
since bladder tumours seem to be the result of  genotoxic as well as acute toxic effects, it is 
difficult to assess how (frequently changing) hair-dye components and other exogenous 
factors contribute to variou s biological effects. A monocausal approach seems to be 
particularly questionable in this case. The heterogeneous results of the many 
epidemiological studies reflect this dilemma. Bolt & Golka (2007) concluded from an 
extensive review of the litera ture that there seems to be no relevant bladder-cancer risk 
associated with the use of hair dyes that are available today. In  other words, the potency is 
considered to be low. On the other hand, the epidemiological results from studies among 
hairdressers indicate that—with all reservation s—the potential of occupational exposure 
to contribute to the overall ca ncer risk cannot be excluded. 
More recently, other possible target tissues have been taken into account. Ambrosone 
et al.  (2007) looked for effect markers of aromatic and heterocyclic amines as well as 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarb ons in exfoliated breast ductal  epithelial cells from breast 
milk as etiological factors for breast-cancer  risk. DNA adducts for each class were 
detected, and the presence of 4-aminobipheny l adducts was associated with the use of 
hair-colouring products. Although this finding does not prove a causal relationship, it 
underlines the view that environmental exposu res contribute to lesi ons in many tissues 
and thereby add to the risk. The suspicion of  a relationship betwee n hair dyes and cancer 
developed when some of the components were found to be genotoxic in in-vitro tests, and 
subsequently also carcinogenic in rodents af ter oral administration. The results were 
negative however, if the amines or co mmercial mixtures containing carcinogenic 
components were tested via topical application. Although the latter route of 
administration is more analogou s to the current use of hair dyes, the other experiments 
indicate a carcinogenic potential under certain  circumstances. If comparable exposure 
conditions would be strenuously required in  carcinogen testing, the relevance of the 
results of many if not most animal experiments becomes questionable. However, it is 
important to keep in mind the difference between hazard and risk. 
A particular aspect with permanent hair colourants is that the colourant is generated 
by oxidation of an amine and the structure of the oxidation product is normally not known 
from the peer-reviewed literature. Prim ary intermediates are for instance para-
phenylenediamine or para-aminophenol, and couplers are meta-aminophenols or meta -
hydroxyphenols. In the presence of peroxide , the primary intermediate and the coupler 
react with each other and coloured oligomers are formed. By itself,  para-phenylene-
diamine is only weakly genoto xic, but a mutagenic trimer (Bandrowski’s base) is formed 
under oxidizing conditions. Moreover, additional activating pathways must be considered 
with diamines and phenolic amines: quinoid structures are involved, which react with 
cellular proteins. In this context it is interesting to note that para-phenylendiamine is an  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 641  
 established contact sensitizer, which indicates that relevant amounts penetrate the skin 
and are biologically active. The incidence of contact sensitizat ion is increased particularly 
among beauticians and hairdressers (Iorizzo et al., 2002). 
In the light of the above, it seems difficult to differentiate between different exposure 
situations on the basis if ep idemiological observations. If there are hazardous components 
involved in exposure to hair colourants , they would probably contribute to the 
background exposure of aromatic amines. Fo r practical purposes, and in line with the 
ALARA principle, established carcinogens should be avoided, omitted or exchanged for less hazardous components, and biological effect  markers should be u sed to establish to 
what extent the professional handling of hair dyes and their personal use contribute to the 
background or total load of aromatic amine exposure. 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data  
5.1.1  Hair Dyes: Production, use, occ upational exposure and exposure after 
personal use 
Modern hair dyes may be classified as a) oxidative (permanent) hair dyes, b) semi-
permanent and c) temporary dyes. Oxidative hair dyes represent approximately 80% of the market and consist of colourless primary intermediates ( para-substituted aromatic 
amines) and couplers ( meta-substituted aromatic amines an d other compounds) that, in 
the presence of peroxide, form the dye by a chemical reaction. The concentration of 
oxidative hair-dye ingredients is approximately proportional to their degree of shade: dark 
colours tend to contain the highest concentrations of colouring ingredients (up to 3% 
primary intermediates during use) wher eas light shades (blond) contain lower 
concentrations. Semi-permanent (direct) ha ir dyes contain colour  molecules of low 
molecular weight, such as nitro-phenols, nitro-aminophenols and nitro-phenylene-
diamines. Temporary dyes contain direct hair dyes of high molecular weight, such as azo, 
triphenylamine and indamine colourants. A worldwide survey in 2005 showed the 
presence of 50 ingredients in oxidative, 43 in semi-permanent and 88 ingredients in 
temporary hair dyes. The most frequently used oxidative hair-d ye ingredients are para-
phenylenediamine, resorcinol, 2,5-diaminotoluene, para- and meta-aminophenol, 4-
amino-2-hydroxytoluene, 4-amino- meta-cresol and 2-methyl-5-hydroxyethylamino-
phenol. The majority of oxidative hair-dye ingredients have been on the market since the 1930s. Most semi-permanent or temporary hair dyes have a much more limited use. 
Occupational exposure studies found no or on ly traces of hair-dye ingredients in the 
air of hair salons, whereas measurable amount s were detected on hairdressers’ hands. The 
major occupational exposure pathway appears to be via skin contact, followed by dermal 
absorption. The same exposure pathway applies to personal (consumer) use of hair dyes. 642 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Hair dyes have been subject to regulation s in many countries, and the number of 
substances permitted for use in hair dyes has been  restricted during the past 40 years; in 
2007, 135 individual ingredients were no longer allowed in the European Union for use in 
hair dyes. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
5.2.1  Professional use of hair colourants 
The Working Group reviewed the literature on cancer at several sites in hairdressers, 
barbers and beauticians. Many additional studies have been published since the previous 
review in 1993 (IARC Monograp h 57). These include severa l case–control studies and a 
few cohort studies. Most data  from cohort studies derive from linkage between census 
data and cancer registries in Scandinavian countries, with limited potential to adjust for 
confounding by important correlates of cancer ri sk, e.g., lifestyle and reproductive factors. 
The Working Group noted that  the evidence mainly concer ned exposures that occurred 
before 1980s, and often much earlier. 
(a) Bladder cancer 
The cohort studies indicated an increased risk  for cancer of the urinary bladder among 
male hairdressers, but not among female hairdressers. In a large Scandinavian cohort of 
hairdressers, barbers, beauticians and other re lated workers identified in the 1970 census 
and followed-up for 20 years, there was a si gnificant 50% increase in risk for bladder 
cancer in men and a non-significant 10% d ecrease in risk in women. Allowance for 
smoking was generally not possible, although results for lung cancer suggest that higher 
exposure to tobacco in hairdressers could not totally account for the bladder cancer 
excess. 
More than 20 case–control st udies were available for ev aluation. Most of these, 
including three of the larger studies, report ed increased risks in the range of 1.3–1.7 in 
male hairdressers. A pooled analysis of 11 studies conducted in six European countries 
found no significant increase in risk among male or female hairdressers. Overall, risks 
appeared generally lower for women than for men. The number of exposed subjects was generally small, and did not allow a reliable assessment of the risk by duration and period 
of exposure. 
In view of the consistent yet modest increase in risk reported in studies of hairdressers 
and barbers, especially men, and in the absen ce of solid data on the relation between 
duration and period of exposure, the Working Group concluded that there was limited 
evidence  of an increased risk for blad der cancer in hairdressers. 
(b) Haematological malignancies 
With regards to cancers of the haematol ogical system, the heterogeneity in the 
diseases included and the differences in th e classification used often hampered  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 643  
 comparison between the results of different st udies. Although one cohort study of barbers 
among male US veterans and an Italian case–control study reported significant increases in risk for multiple myeloma based on on ly few exposed cases, these results were not 
replicated in other studies. In the large Scandinavian cohort, no excess was found in either 
sex for multiple myeloma or for other haematological malignancies. 
(c) Breast cancer 
Many studies on breast cancer, including the largest case–control and cohort studies, 
did not show any increased risk for breast cancer  associated with professional use of hair 
colourants. 
(d) Childhood cancers 
One cohort study and five case–control studies investigat ed the risk for childhood 
cancers in the offspring of hairdressers and ba rbers. Although some positive associations 
were reported, an overall evaluation is diff icult because of the different sites and/or 
histologies investigated in va rious studies and the problems in the identification of the 
relevant period of exposure (before or around conception, or during pregnancy). 
(e) Other sites 
(i) Ovarian cancer 
A modest increase in risk fo r ovarian cancer was reported in two cohorts of US 
cosmetologists and Scandinavian  hairdressers, which was signif icant only in the latter 
study. The excess in risk app eared stronger in—or limited to—women exposed in earlier 
periods. No case–control study was available for evaluation. The lack  of adjustment for 
potential confounders, especially reproductive history and oral contraceptive use, does not 
allow confounding to be ruled out. 
(ii) Lung cancer 
Small increases in lung cancer risk of the or der of 20–40% were found in most cohort 
studies, which did not, however, adequately adjust for smoking. A higher prevalence of smokers among hairdressers than in the genera l population was reported in Scandinavia 
and the USA. No informative case–control study was available for evaluation. The 
Working Group concluded that tobacco smoking  cannot be excluded as a likely cause of 
the modest excess in lung can cer observed in hairdressers. 
5.2.2  Personal use of hair colourants 
The Working Group revised and evaluated the epidemiological evidence of an 
association between cancer at several s ites and personal use of hair dyes. 644 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (a) Bladder cancer 
Several studies with contradi ctory results have been pu blished. Increased risks for 
bladder cancer were reported in two studies in the USA, while no association was found 
in three larger studies, two from the USA and one from Spain. Th ese recent studies had 
similar characteristics in design and methodology. 
One study from the USA suggested an incr eased risk for bladder cancer among users 
of hair colourants, in particular among those who exclusively used permanent hair dyes. 
Further, this study showed that exclusive use of permanent dyes among subjects with 
slow acetylation ( NAT2  genotype) or among CYP1A2 slow metabolizers was associated 
with an increased risk for bladder cancer. Th e other studies did not confirm these results. 
In the Spanish study, there was no indicatio n of an increased risk for bladder cancer 
associated with the NAT2  genotype, but there was a no n-significant association with 
NAT1*10 . The available cohort studies were la rgely negative for bladder cancer. The 
available meta-analyses did not show an association. 
The Working Group considered that the av ailable evidence for cancer of the bladder 
was overall inadequate . 
(b) Haematological malignancies 
The results for this tumour type were difficult to interpret: many different 
malignancies are involved, and many of th e studies do not prov ide analyses for the 
different disease entities. Historically, the results have been inconsistent in identifying an 
increased risk. While cohort studies were  largely negative for haematological 
malignancies, the results of case–control studi es varied greatly. In those that showed an 
increased risk, the increase tended to be moderate . A recent pooled analysis was evaluated 
with particular interest because it was a la rge study evaluating ha ir-dye exposure in 
relation to single lymphoma entities including case–control da ta derived from Canada, the 
USA and six countries in Euro pe. The study showed an ov erall increased risk of 1.1 
among women who were regular users, and of 1.3 among those women who had started regular hair-dye use before 1980. The risk was consistently elevated for follicular 
lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaem ia, but not for other types. For these 
lymphoma subtypes, the risk did not vary by intensity, years of use or type of exposure, remaining generally of the order 1.2–1.4. When the period of first use was considered, the 
increased risk for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was mainly observed among those who 
started use before 1980, with a statistical ly significant increase in risk among those 
reporting use for more than 20 years. For follicular ly mphoma, increased risks were 
observed throughout the two study periods. Overall, the Working Group considered this 
evidence to be inadequate . 
(c) Breast cancer 
For breast cancer the Working Gr oup considered the evidence as inadequate  based on 
several studies, none of which except one showed an association.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 645  
 (d) Childhood cancers 
For childhood cancers, the studies evaluated dealt with childhood brain tumours and 
Wilms tumours. The Working Group discussed  in depth the potential biases and study 
limitations that could explain some of the increased risks observed for some brain 
tumours, and considered that some of the reported associations could not be simply 
explained by recall bias, as mothers may not ha ve known about this hypothesis at the time 
of the studies. The Working Group considered that the evidence prese nted in the studies 
was inadequate . 
(e) Other sites 
Only a few studies were available to th e Working Group, and no evaluation was 
made. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
Various commercially available hair-dye formulations and various laboratory 
preparations of hair dyes were tested fo r carcinogenicity in mice or rats by skin 
application in 11 studies and by subcutane ous injection in a single study in rats. 
In three studies by skin pa inting in mice, all using different formulations, increased 
incidences of lymphomas were observed in female mice compared with concurrent 
controls, for five different formulations. The increased incidences were not significant 
when compared with historical controls. In three studies by skin painting in rats, a 
significant increase in the incidence of mamma ry adenomas in females was observed for 
two formulations, and a significant increase in  pituitary adenomas was seen in females for 
one formulation and in males for a different formulation. In the single subcutaneous 
injection study in rats, an increased inci dence in mammary and uterine tumours was 
observed. The other studies eith er showed no increased incidence of tumours at any site 
or were inadequate for evaluation. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
Studies that investigated the induction of  chromosomal aberrations in peripheral 
blood lymphocytes of professional hair-colourists or in volunteers who had their hair dyed 
reported no effect. The same is true for tw o studies that investigated sister chromatid 
exchange in lymphocytes of hairdressers. Two studies on the mutagenicity of urine 
collected from hair-dye users and cosmetolog ists were inadequate for evaluation. One 
study assessed sister chromatid exchange, DN A breakage (measured by single-cell gel 
electrophoresis) in lymphocytes and mutagenicity  in urine in professi onal hair-colourists. 
No effect was seen for any of these three en dpoints. A study on micronucleus formation 
in hair-dye users did not show a difference with non-user controls. 646 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 In an early study, 90% of a large numb er of commercial oxidative hair-dye 
formulations were mutagenic in bacteria. In later studies, this percentage dropped to 0–
50%. The hair-colouring product henna did not show bacterial mutagenicity in one study. 
When tested separately, its active ingredient was mutagenic. 
The urine of rats skin-paint ed with oxidative hair-colouring products was mutagenic 
when collected during the first 24 hours.  The mutagenicity disappeared afterwards. 
No effects were seen in a heritable transl ocation assay in rats skin-painted twice 
weekly for ten weeks with a sem i-permanent dye formulation. 
6. Evaluation  
6.1 Cancer in humans 
There is limited evidence  in humans for the carcinogenici ty of occupational exposures 
as a hairdresser or barber. 
There is inadequate evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of personal use of 
hair colourants. 
6.2 Cancer in experimental animals 
There is limited evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of hair 
colourants. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
Occupational exposures as a hairdresser or barber are probably carcinogenic to 
humans  (Group 2A) . 
Personal use of hair colourants is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans  
(Group 3) .
