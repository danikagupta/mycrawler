flexibility of the open form of plasmin may 
be important in its role in fibrinolysis. Since 
plasmin binds to fibrin through kringle 1, 
the protease domain, 554 amino acids away 
at the opposite end of the molecule, has a 
large radius within which to cleave fibrin 
(32). This would allow the open form, Lys- 
plasmin, to act catalytically on fibrin where- 
as the more rigid closed form of plasmin 
may act only stoichiometrically. Preliminary 
analysis of small-angle neutron scattering 
data from a variant of plasminogen missing 
the first 76 amino acids, Lys-plasminogen, 
and an NH2-terminal fragment of plasmino- 
gen containing the first 3 kringles, indicates 
that their conformations were in the open 
form in the presence or absence of ligand 
binding.

Two-Photon Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscopy 
WINFRIED DENK,* JAMES H. STRICKLER, WATr W. WEBB 
Molecular excitation by the simultaneous absorption of two photons provides intrinsic 
three-dimensional resolution in laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. The excitation 
of fluorophores having single-photon absorption in the ultraviolet with a stream of 
strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of red laser light has made possible fluorescence 
images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescence emission 
increased quadratically with the excitation intensity so that fluorescence and photo- 
bleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane as expected for cooperative 
two-photon excitation. This technique also provides unprecedented capabilities for 
three-dimensional, spatially resolved photochemistry, particularly photolytic release of 
caged effector molecules. 
W E REPORT THE APPLICATION OF 
two-photon excitation of fluores- 
cence (1) to laser scanning mi- 
croscopy (LSM) (2). In LSM, the laser is 
focused to a diffraction-limited beam waist 
<1 p,m in diameter and is raster-scanned 
across a specimen. Confocal LSM provides 
depth discrimination and improves spatial 
resolution within the plane of focus by 
forming the image through the same scan- 
ning optics used for illumination and 
through a pinhole placed in front of the 
detector, which acts as a spatial filter to 
select emission from the plane of focus (2). 
Very good laser scanning micrographs have 
been obtained with the use of fluorescent 
markers that absorb and emit visible light 
(3). Confocal scanning images with fluoro- 
phores and fluorescent chemical indicators 
that are excited by the ultraviolet (UV) part 
of the spectrum have not appeared, howev- 
er, largely because of the lack of suitable 
microscope lenses, which must be chromati- 
cally corrected and transparent for both

Anticipated photodamage to living cells and 
the limitations of UV lasers have also inhib- 
ited this approach. 
Two-photon molecular excitation (1, 6) is 
made possible by the very high local instan- 
taneous intensity provided by the tight fo- 
cusing in an LSM combined with the tem- 
poral concentration of a femtosecond pulsed 
laser. With a colliding-pulse, mode-locked 
dye laser (7) (CPM) producing a stream of 
pulses with a pulse duration (Tp) of about 
100 fs at a repetition rate (fp) of about 80 
MHz, the probability becomes appreciable 
for a dye molecule to absorb two long- 
wavelength (XcPM) photons simultaneously, 
thus combining their energy in order to 
reach its excited state. Assuming a typical 
two-photon cross section (8) of a = 10-58 
m4-s per photon with the above pulse pa- 
rameters and the beam focused by a lens of 
numerical aperture A 1.4, we calculated 
that an average incident laser power (po) of 
-50 mW would saturate the fluorescence 
output at the limit of one absorbed photon 
pair per pulse per fluorophore (9). The 
fluorescence emission could be increased, 
however, if the pulse repetition frequency 
were increased to the inverse fluorescence

fluorescence excited by two-

these images of a cluster of

latex beads are volume- B

marin 138 and have their 
measured absorption and 
emission maxima at 365 and 
415 nm, respectively. The 
data comprise ten averages 
for each section with no 
background subtraction or 
image enhancement. The to- 
tal time to acquire the data 
was less than 2 min. (B) The

lifetime of typically Tf-I 109 s-1. For 
comparison, one-photon fluorescence satu- 
ration occurs at incident powers of about 3 
mW (4). 
To illustrate (Fig. 1) the depth discrimi- 
nation achieved in these first experiments, 
we generated a stereo image pair from a 
stack of images of a cluster of fluorescent 
latex beads 9 p.m in diameter, which are 
normally excited by UY light at A 365 nm 
(Fluoresbrite BB; Polysciences). The images 
were recorded with a standard LSM (Bio- 
Rad; MRC 500) with its continuous-wave 
argon ion laser illuminator replaced by a 25- 
mW CPM (X 630 nm) (Clark Instru- 
ments, Pittsford, New York). Throughput 
measurements (4) indicate that -3 mW 
reached the object plane. An emission filter, 
passing wavelengths from 380 to 445 nm, 
was used, and the detector aperture was 
opened to its limit to reduce the optical 
sectioning effect that would result from a 
small confocal aperture. 
The blue fluorescence power detected 
from areas inside individual beads -10 p.m 
in diameter increased with the square of the 
excitation power, which we adjusted by 
changing neutral density filters in the excita- 
tion beam. Fluorescence power measure- 
ments over a two-decade range with back- 
ground corrected only for scattering, mea- sured in an area outside the bead, all fell 
within -10% of a logarithmic best-fit 
straight line, which has a slope of 2.06 + 
0.09. This result clearly indicates two-pho- 
ton excitation. We estimated the excitation 
cross section to be 5 x 10-58 m4-s per 
photon (within a factor of 3) by taking into 
account the dye concentration in the beads, 
the optical throughput of the LSM, Tp, f 
A, andpo and using equation 4 of (10). This 
value is comparable to previously measured values for similar dyes (8, 1i). 
A scanned image of chromosomes in di- 
viding cells (LLC-PK-1; American Type 
Culture Collection) stained by cellular DNA 
labeling with a UV excitable fluorescent 
stain (Hoechst 33258) is shown in Fig. 2. 
The image acquisition time, 13 s, was short 
as compared to the bleaching time of several 
minutes. No degradation was apparent in 
the micromorphology of these live cells even 
after illumination by the scanning laser for 
several minutes. 
Photobleaching during protracted scan- 
ning occurred only in a slice about 2 ,um 
thick around the focal plane, as is evident 
from the horizontal band of reduced bright- 
ness bleached out of a fluorescent bead (Fig. 
3) that was scanned for 6 min at a constant 
focal plane position. Similar localization of 
bleaching was observed in the fluorescently 
stained cell nuclei. This localization illus- 
trates a distinct advantage of two-photon 
excitation over single-photon excitation, 
where the entire specimen is bleached even 
when only a single plane is imaged. For one- 
photon excitation, bleaching in both scan- 
ning and broad-field microscopy (at least in 
a regime of intensity-independent bleaching 
cross section) (12) depends on the time- 
averaged excitation intensity, which does 
not vary along the axial or z direction. For 
two-photon excitation, on the other hand, 
bleaching depends on the time-averaged 
square of the intensity, which falls off 
strongly above and below the focal plane (as 
l/Z2 for large z). 
The quadratic dependence of signal on 
excitation intensity is responsible for anoth- 
er advantage of two-photon excitation: it 
provides an optical sectioning effect, even 
with a detector such as a charge-coupled 
device (CCD) array which views the whole 
field, without a pinhole as a spatial filter. 
This sectioning effect (Fig. 3) is similar to 
Fig. 2. A two-photon excit- 
ed fluorescence image gen- 
erates an optical section 
through chromosones of 
live cultured pig kidney cells 
(LLC-PK-1), stained with a 
viable DNA stain (Hoechst 
33258) by incubation in a 
solution (5 mg/liter) for 5 
min at 37C. Two ceUs are 
seen in interphase, and one 
cell is seen in anaphase. The 
image was recorded with a 
fMlly open detector pinhok 
and comprises a 13-frame 
average (total time, 13 s).

perpendicular to the focal plane (xz section) of a

field (26 ,um by 17 p.m) with the focus slighdy 
below the center of the bead. The dark zone just 
below the center coincides with the location of 
the focal plane. The oblong shape of the image of 
a bead, which is itr fact spherical, is due to 
refractive distortion. The total dose of red laser 
light was -2 mj/p.m2. We estinated that at least 
several thousand photons were emitted from each

that achieved with one-photon excitation in 
conjunction with an optimal confocal pin- 
hole. But two-photon excitation avoids the 
serious problems associated with chromatic 
aberration in the objective lens (4, 5) and 
pinhole throughput losses (4) that plague 
confocal LSM. 
Two-photon photolysis can be used for 
fast and localized release of biologically ac- 
tive chemicals (13) such as caged Ca2+, H+, 
nucleotides, and neurotransmitters (14). For 
example, if caged neurotransmitters (15) are 
released by the scanning beam, the whole- 
cell transmembrane current might be used as 
the contrast-generating mechanism to map 
the distribution of receptor activity for those 
transmitters on the cell surface. We demon- 
strated the feasibility of two-photon cage 
photolysis by irradiating DMNPE {3-O-[l- 
(2-nitrophenyl)ether]ester} caged adenosine 
trphosphate (ATP) (33 mM) [Molecular 
Probes, Eugene, Oregon) with the CPM 
focused to a beam waist diameter of ~10 
p.m. Photolysis yields of -10"1 mol of 
ATP were measured with the use of a lucif- 
emi bioluminescence assay (Calbiochem, 
San Diego, Califorriia). Typically -10% of the caged ATP in an aliquot volume of -IO' 
p.m3 was photolyzed in the illumination 
volume of -I04 p.m3 during -600 s. This 
result implies potential cage release times 
<1 s in the 104- pLm3 illumination volume 
and presumably much faster photolysis with 
stronger focusing in smaller volumes. 
Because two-photon excitation provides 
access by visible hlght to excitation energies 
corresponding to single UV photon excita- 
tion, a whole new class of fluorophores and 
fluorescent indicators (16) such as Indo-I 
for Ca2+, Mag-Indo-I for Mg2+, SBFI for 
Na+, and PBFI for K+ becomes accessible 
to three-dimensional resolved LSM. Al- 
though two-photon cross sections are not 
yet known for many of these compounds 
and different selection rules apply to two- 
photon absorption (17), molecular asymme- 
try often allows both one-photon and two- 
photon transitions into the same excited 
state (3). Reports of two-photon excitation 
cross sections >10 --6 m4-s per photon, 
with excitation spectra shifted, however, 
from the one-photon spectra, suggest chro- 
mophores suited to two-photon LSM (18). 
Visible fluorescence was observed from - 10 
mM solutions of Indo-1, fura-1, Hoechst 
33258, Hoechst 33342, dansyl hydrazine 
(Molecular Probes) (16), Stilbene 420 (Ex- 
citon Chemical Company, Dayton, Ohio), 
and several coumarin dyes upon excitation 
by a CMP weakly focused to a beam waist 
25 .m in diameter, and two-photon excited 
LSM fluorescence images of microcrystals of 
dansyl hydrazine and Coumarin 440 were 
recorded. 
Three-dimensional optical memory de- 
vices relying on multiphoton processes in

points were exposed for approximately 13 s each. 
Scale bar, 2 pn.m two intersecting beams for writing and read- 
ing operations have recently been proposed 
(19). Simplicity and maximal information 
packing density may favor a scheme based 
on the use of a single beam. Multiphoton 
processes would then be localized to the 
high-intensity region at the focus. In fact, 
we have demonstrated two-photon bleach- 
ing of microscopic patterns generated with 
an LSM inside fluorescent beads (Fig. 4), 
which constitutes a high-density write-once 
memory that is readable at least 103 times 
with present fluorophores. 
Practical realization of two-photon laser 
scanning fluorescence microscopy for bio- 
logical and other applications has been dem- 
onstrated. Two-photon excited fluorescence 
LSM provides inherent three-dimensional 
resolution comparable to that of confocal 
LSM. Use of a confocal pinhole in conjunc- 
tion with two-photon excitation firther im- 
proves resolution along all three axes. Back- 
ground that is linear in the excitation inten- 
sity can be eliminated by scaled subtraction 
of images recorded at different input pow- 
ers. The time required to record our images 
(about 10 s for a laser power of 3 mW at the 
focal plane) should be easily reduced by a 
factor of at least 10 and the image quality 
greatly improved by the increase in the 
optical throughput alone. 
Photobleaching, and presumably photo- 
dynamic damage, are confined to the vicini- 
ty of the focal plane (Figs. 3 and 4) in the 
two-photon case. This is expected to pro- 
vide a considerable advantage over both 
confocal LSM and area detector imaging for 
the acquisition of data for three-dimensional 
reconstruction, because UV photodamage 
to cells and fluorophores will be confined to 
the volume from which information is actu- 
ally collected. This principle also allows 
sharp localization of purposeful photochem- 
ical processes, such as photolysis and pho- 
toactivation, within the focal volume. 
The physiological advantage of two-pho- 
ton photoexcitation for fluorescence studies 
of living cells remains to be evaluated. We 
can make only qualitative statements about 
cell viability on the basis of morphology 
comparisons of our visual observations after 
two-photon scanngin excitation of the DNA 
stain and after wide-field excitation with UV 
from a conventional mercury arc illumina- 
tor. Although a few minutes of exposure to 
the mercury arc produced severe morpho- 
logical changes including central rounding 
with extensive retraction fibers, the exposure 
to the two-photon excitation at roughly the 
same energy per cell produced no visible 
morphological change. It has not been de- 
termined whether mitosis was inhibited.

tion of chromophores ordinarily excited

dynamic perturbation entirely and facilitate 
protracted fluorescence observations of liv-

Association of Human Papillomavirus Types 16 and 
18 E6 Proteins with p53 
BRUCE A. WERNESS, ARNOLD J. LEVINE, PETER M. HOWLEY 
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is a DNA tumor virus that is associated with 
human anogenital cancers and encodes two transforming proteins, E6 and E7. The E7 
protein has been shown to bind to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product, 
pRB. This study shows that the E6 protein of HPV-16 is capable of binding to the 
cellular p53 protein. The ability of the E6 proteins from different human papillomavi- 
ruses to form complexes with p53 was assayed and found to correlate with the in vivo 
clinical behavior and the in vitro transforming activity of these different papillomavi- 
ruses. The wild-type p53 protein has tumor suppressor properties and has also been 
found in association with large T antigen and the ElB 55-kilodalton protein in cells 
transformed by SV40 and by adenovirus type 5, respectively, providing further 
evidence that the human papiliomaviruses, the adenoviruses, and SV40 may effect 
similar cellular pathways in transformation.

(HPVs) that infect the anogenital 
area can be separated on the basis of 
their clinical associations into two distinct 
groups. The first group, including HPV-6 
and HPV-11, is generally associated with 
benign anogenital warts that infrequently 
progress to cancer and have been referred to 
as "low-risk" viruses. The "high-risk" group, 
including HPV-16 and HPV-18, is associat- 
ed with lesions that are at high risk for 
malignant progression and with almost all 
cervical carcinomas (1). The ability of cloned 
viral genomes derived from the high-risk but 
not the low-risk HPVs to transform cells in 
culture suggests that these papillomavirus

(2). In cervical carcinomas and in cell lines 
derived from cervical carcinomas, the E6 
and E7 open reading frames (ORFs) of the 
high-risk HPVs are regularly found to be 
intact and actively transcribed, implicating 
the E6 and E7 genes in the malignant 
phenotype (3, 4). Support for this role is 
provided by genetic analyses that establish 
the requirement for both E6 and E7 for the 
efficient transformation of primary human 
squamous epithelial cells by HPV-16 (5). 
DNA tumor viruses appear to exert some 
of their proliferative and oncogenic effects 
on the host cell through interactions with 
cellular proteins. The HPV-16 E7 protein, 
like SV40 large T antigen (6) and adenovi- 
rus EIA (7), is capable of binding pRB (8). 
The E7 proteins of both high-risk and low- 
risk genital type HPVs have been shown to 
bind to pRB (9). The E7 proteins of HPV-6 and HPV-11 bind with 20-fold and 5-fold 
lower affinities, respectively, than the E7 
proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18. Thus, 
the ability of E7 to bind pRB per se does not 
alone allow for the qualitative discrimina- 
tion between the different biologic proper- 
ties of these viruses. The oncogenic poten- 
tial of the E6 protein encoded by the high- 
risk HPVs has been revealed in transforma- 
tion studies with primary human cells (5, 
10). Like the E7 protein, which is 98 amino 
acids in size, the E6 protein is small (158 
amino acids), and it is likely that its trans- 
forming properties may also result from the 
ability to form complexes with and poten- 
tially modulate the activity of critical cellular 
proteins that regulate cellular growth and 
differentiation. Since the large T antigen of 
SV40 (11, 12) and the E1B 55-kD protein 
of adenovirus 5 (13) can form a complex 
with the p53 protein, we explored the possi- 
bility that HPV-16 E6 also encodes a p53 
binding protein. Although formerly classi- 
fied as a dominantly acting oncogene (14- 
16) wild-type p53 has been shown to have 
tumor suppressor properties (17-22). 
The possibility that HPV-16 E6 or E7 
bound to or interacted with p53 was as- 
sessed by an in vitro binding assay similar to 
that used to show E7 complex formation 
with pRB (8). For these experiments, la- 
beled HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins synthe- 
sized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates were 
mixed with lysates of unlabeled mouse F9 
cells. The F9 cells contain wild-type p53 
protein that, unlike mutant p53 protein, 
binds efficiently to SV40 large T antigen 
(19, 23). The mixture was incubated with 
antibodies directed against p53, and the 
immunoprecipitate was analyzed for the
