In this study, partial-nitrification and anammox biomass were co-immobilized by polyvinyl alcohol 
and sodium alginate (PVA-SA) to treat the ammonium-rich wastewater. The enriched partial nitrifi -
cation and anammox sludge entrapped in the beads. The beads were round in shape with 4–5 mm in 
diameter and not agglomerated with each other. The ammonium removal efficiency of 80% achieved 
within ten days. The nitrogen loading rate varied from the start (37 mg/L/d) to the end of experiment 
(75 mg/L/d). The enriched sludge,suitable environment inside of the beads for growth of bacteria, 
and low diffusion constraints were the possible reasons for the fast start-up of PN-anammox system. 
The necrosis/apoptosis analysis confirmed that there was no observed death phenomena inside of 
the gel beads in a normal operation of the reactor. The microbial community analysis showed that the 
dominance of phyla Proteobacteria (35.35%) while the abundance of phyla Planctomycetes was 2.42%. 
Likewise, at the genus level, Candidatus Brocadia accounts for 1.33% while Nitrosomonas was 0.89%, 
but the highest shared observed from the genus Burkholderia . The use of immobilization technology 
in the application of the SNAP process may represent a valuable alternative to other technologies 
such as granulation, suspended cell growth and biofilm system.

1. Introduction
Ammonium in the wastewater from different industrial 
operations is one of the major concern of the environment. 
Traditionally, nitrogen removal was carried out with nitri -
fication-denitrification (N/DN) from the past decades. The 
conventional N/DN route increased the cost of treatment 
for the wastewater with lower carbon to nitrogen ratio due 
to the need of external carbon sources and aeration. So, 
decreasing the cost of treatment facility needs more atten -
tion from the wastewater treatment engineers. The last 
decades of 20th century revolutionized in the removal of 
nitrogen from wastewater with the discovery of anaerobic 
ammonium oxidation (anammox) [1]. Compared to conven -
tional nitrogen removal process, anammox free from oxygen and organic matter requirements could reduce the cost of 
wastewater treatment [2]. The combined partial nitrification 
and anammox in a single stage process reduce the require -
ment of oxygen about 60% and 100% of organic matter, 
produce about 90% less sludge compared to conventional 
N/DN [3,4]. Furthermore, the anammox process removed 
ammonia with an amount of nitrite as an essential substrate -
from wastewater in the form of nitrogen gas, and produce a 
little amount of nitrate [5]. Anammox bacteria activated the 
genes system when detect ammonium nitrogen in the envi -
ronment by a unique structure know as ammonium antenna 
[6]. The nitrite is firstly oxidize to NO in a unique compart -
ment of anammox bacteria known as anammoxosome, then 
NO condensed with and converted into N2H2 by hydrazine 
synthase enzyme and the pathway complete by conversion 
of N2H2 to N2 by hydrazine dehydrogenase enzymes [7].H.A. Ahmad et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 164 (2019) 206–214207
Predominantly, anammox bacteria belonged to the 
planctomycetes group of microorganisms which has low 
growth characteristics [5]. Typically, reported doubling time 
of anammox bacteria varied from 2.1 to 16 d [8–10]. Thus, 
low biomass yield and long start-up period of the anam -
mox [11] need more research. Besides, anammox need an 
amount of nitrite as an electron acceptor. Ammonium rich 
wastewater should be pretreated for the balanced nitrite 
concentration before feeding into the anammox reactor [12]. 
The combination of partial nitrification (PN) and anammox 
seems to be a good alternative to treat the ammonium rich 
wastewater. However, the different growth environment 
of both bacteria could cause a problem in the real applica -
tion. The PN bacteria need an amount of oxygen while oxy -
gen-free environment is essential for anammox growth. The 
diverse approaches have been reported including PN-ana -
mmox process (SNAP) in a single reactor system [13] as 
well as two-reactor system [14]. The two-reactor system 
increases the cost of the treatment facility and higher nitro -
gen concentration rises the process instability [15]. While, 
one reactor system need strict control of DO and pH [16].
Similarly, in a single reactor system, PN bacteria need 
oxygen for carrying their activity, but anammox bacteria are 
sensitive to oxygen concentration. The different strategies 
including the formation of granules [17,18] and the devel -
opment of biofilm on the different surfaces [19–21] have 
been applied from the discovery of anammox. But, even the 
effectiveness of granular sludge, long-term process stabil -
ity is still a problem due to the formation of gas pockets 
inside the granules which ultimately cause the floatation of 
granules [2,22,23] and lead toward the washout of sludge 
from the system. Similarly, biofilm formation also has some 
demerits for long term stability of the process. The thick 
biofilm causes the reduction of water head which lead to 
the failure of the treatment system [24]. In that case, fur -
ther efforts must be made to control the biofilm thickness 
by providing enough shear-stress.
So, there is a need to address the problems of biomass 
washout. The immobilization of anammox and nitrifying 
bacteria was well reported in the past decades. The differ -
ent gel material has been applied for the co-immobilization 
of anammox and partial nitrification bacteria as well. The 
reported material used for the immobilization of anammox 
included polyethylene glycol gel [25], waterborne polyure -
thane [26], polyvinyl alcohol [27], sodium alginate and the 
combined polyvinyl alcohol-sodium alginate [28]. Immobi -
lization of bacterial cell within the PVA-SA gel material was 
achieved by two methods. The main difference between 
these two methods was the second step of immobilization, 
which included the hardening process of gel beads or cubes. 
The reinforcing of beads or cubes was carried out by chem -
ical [28] as well as by freezing methods [29]. The suitable 
oxygen concentration and provision of moderate nitrite 
in the co-immobilized system of AOB and anammox were 
also studied. The primary consideration behind the used of 
gel co-immobilized PN-Anammox system was that the PN 
bacteria grow on the outer layer of the beads and provide 
the protection to anammox growing in the inner layers by 
consuming oxygen and provided nitrite in the vicinity of 
anammox [30]. But, the practical evidence of nitrifying and 
anammox bacterial activity within the beads was missing. 
Moreover, there were not reported studies about the lethal phenomena inside of the gel beads. The novelty of this 
research is the practical evidence of bacterial performance 
by scannng electron microscopy (SEM) and apoptosis/
necrosic anlysis.
So, this research aimed to investigate the nitrogen 
removal and startup of the co-immobilized PN-Anammox 
system in the single reactor system and to verify the activ -
ity of immobilized biomass inside the gel beads. The lethal 
phenomena for AOB and anammox inside the gel beads 
and the microbial characteristics of the SNAP system were 
also investigated.
2. Methods
2.1. The operation of the system and synthetic wastewater
The serum bottle with the working volume of 1.0 L was 
used as a reactor. PN-anammox gel carriers with a volume 
of 180 ml were placed in the reactor (18% filling ratio). The 
hydraulic retraction time (HRT) of 32 h was controlled by 
adjusting the peristaltic pump (Model No. BT100-2J) speed 
(about 0.7 rpm). The continuous mixing of the beads was 
carried out by a magnetic stirrer. The reaction temperature 
was maintained between 33–35°C by using a thermostatic 
water bath. The influent tank was flushed with oxygen to 
control the DO in the reactor. The synthetic medium was 
applied as a source of influent wastewater. All materials 
were analytically graded and buy from Sino-pharm chemi -
cal reagent co. Ltd. Composition of synthetic medium (g/L) 
included NH4HCO3 (0.282), KH2PO4 (0.81), CaCl2 (0.20), 
MgSO4·7H2O (0.03) with 1 ml trace element solution. Trace 
elements solution (g/L) consisted of MnCl2·4H2O (0.2), 
NaMoO4·2H2O (0.11), CoCl2·6H2O (0.2), ZnSO4·7H2O (0.1), 
NiCl2·6H2O (0.04), and FeCl3·6H2O (0.24).
2.2. Preparation of microbial immobilized gel beads
PN sludge was cultivated in the lab under the same con -
ditions as reported [31]. Mature anammox granular sludge 
was taken from the lab-scale working reactor [32]. Granu -
lar sludge of anammox was crushed by using a pestle-type 
tissue homogenizer to get sludge flocs with a size of less 
than 100 μm. The mature PN and ANAMMOX sludge were 
entrapped in polyvinyl alcohol-sodium alginate by a sim -
ilar process as reported [33]. The biomass ratio of PN and 
ANAMMOX was 1:2 (wet weight of sludge). 
2.3. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The surface morphology, inner structure, and profile 
of immobilized bacteria were studied by SEM. Gel beads 
were taken out from the reactor and washed with phos -
phate buffer solution. The samples were fixed in 2.5% 
glutaraldehyde for 12 h, then cleaned by deionized water 
three times for 10 minutes each. The cleaned beads were 
dehydrated in ascending order of 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% 
and 100% ethanol solutions for 10 min each. Following that, 
samples were washed three times with t-butanol for 10 min 
each time, and then freeze-dried. Finally, the samples were 
observed by SEM (S-570, Japan) coupled with EDX (Oxford 
INCA X, Japan).H.A. Ahmad et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 164 (2019) 206–214208
2.4. Cell apoptosis analysis
The beads were cleaned by deionized water and then 
placed in a conical flask with phosphate buffer solution 
mixing with a magnetic stirrer until agglomerated. Next, 
the supernatant was removed after centrifugation, and the 
precipitate was washed by D-Hanks balance solution for 
2–3 times, then it was filtered through a cell filter with a 
pore size of 40 μm for three times to obtain a cell suspen -
sion. The detection of apoptosis was followed by apoptotic 
and necrotic assay kit (Apoptosis and Necrosis Assay Kit, 
Beyotime Biotechnology, China).
2.5. Chemical analysis
Ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate were measured accord -
ing to the standard methods (APHA-2009). The measure -
ment of pH was carried out using a digital, portable pH 
meter.
2.6. DNA extraction and analysis of microbial community 
 (Illumina MiSeq sequencing)
The separation of the sludge from the gel beads was the 
same as in the cell apoptosis process. The DNA extraction kit 
of MO BIO (USA) was selected for the extraction of sludge 
sample, and the specific operation procedure depends on 
the method of the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The DNA sample was amplified, and the quality was 
detected by agarose gel electrophoresis (genomic DNA: gel 
concentration 1%, voltage 100 V , electrophoresis time 40 
min before sequencing; PCR products: gel concentration 
2%, voltage 80 V , electrophoresis time 40 min). The con -
centration, purity, fragment size and completeness of the 
sample genome and amplified products were detected. The 
results showed that the bands were single and apparent. 
Afterwards, Illumina MiSeq sequencing was carried out 
by NuoheZhiyuan Technology Co. Ltd (Beijing, China) to 
detect the microbial structure and abundance.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of microbial immobilized gel beads
The shape and size of the beads are important parame -
ters for the stable SNAP process. The agglomeration of the 
beads is another factor affecting the process efficiency and 
life of the beads. The morphology of beads (Fig. 1a) is round 
in shape and not clustered with each other. The steady per -
formance of the process also depends on the presence and 
distribution of the microorganisms inside of the beads. Fig. 
1b shows the presence and equal distribution of sludge in 
the section of gel bead. The diffusion of the substrate inside 
of the beads also needs to be considered for the successful 
PN-anammox process. Fig. 1c is the SEM photograph of the 
whole beads while Fig. 1d depicts the section of the beads 
showing the network structure of the beads. The network -
ing of the PVA-SA material created a micro whole to facili -
tate the transport of substrate deep inside of the beads.
Two kinds of bacteria (anammox and AOB) were dis -
tinguished based on their sizes and shapes. As it was con -firmed that anammox cell size varied from 0.8 to 11.0 mm 
in diameter with distinct round and oval shape [34]. At the 
same time, AOB bacteria were divided into five genera on 
the base of their shapes as well as intracytoplasmic mem -
brane arrangement [35]. Furthermore, the micro-units of 
anammox was developed when they tightly integrated [36]. 
In this study, the dissemination of AOB and anammox were 
carried out microscopically on day 1. The scanning elec -
tronic microphotograph of the beads on day one was taken 
to characterize the AOB and anammox bacteria (Figs. 1e 
and 1f). Fig. 1e and 1f showed the inside profile of the beads 
and presence of the microbial biomass. Partial nitrifying 
bacteria and anammox bacteria morphologically character -
ized inside of the beads. The results of SEM analysis were in 
parallel with the result obtained by Qiao et al. [30].
3.2. The performance of SNAP by immobilization
The nitrogen removal process was carried out with gel 
immobilized SNAP biomass. Fig. 2 shows the influent and 
effluent concentrations of nitrogenous compounds (ammo -
nium, nitrite, and nitrate). The experiment was carried out 
for about 57 d to check the inhibitory effects of the cross -
link solution and the start-up period of the SNAP process. 
The influent ammonium concentration gradually increased 
from 50 to 100 mg/L (NLR varied from 37 mg/L/d to 75 
mg/L/d). Average ammonium removal efficiency reached 
about 54%, and the accumulation of nitrite was not observed 
during the start of the experiment. Our result was well 
correlated with the previous study, which reported about 
56% removal efficiency of ammonia with no nitrite in the 
effluent [37]. It was reported that anammox activity was not 
observed within 20 d due to the lag phase period with poly -
ethylene glycol gel immobilized anammox [25]. There was 
no lag period observed in this study. From day 10, influ -
ent ammonium concentration increased to 75 mg/L. The 
ammonium removal efficiency of about 80%was achieved. 
The higher ammonium removal efficiency may attribute to 
the higher anammox affinity for nitrite over NOB bacteria. 
Furthermore, it was reported that the change in the influent 
ammonium concentration decreased the removal efficiency 
owing to the abrupt higher ammonium loading rate [30]. 
But in our study this phenomenon was not observed. So, the 
method with gradually increased ammonium concentra -
tion is suggested for the stable nitrogen removal efficiency. 
The nitrate concentration was lower than the detection limit 
which satisfied that the growth of NOB was suppressed. 
From day 20, the concentration of influent ammonium was 
increased to 100 mg/L. The effluent ammonium concen -
tration increased sharply with the accumulation of nitrite. 
Then, effluent ammonium showed a downward trend. The 
effluent nitrite concentration was below the detection limit 
from day 30. The nitrate concentration started to increase 
from day 20, and the values were stabilized between 15–16 
mg/L. The nitrate concentration with reference to ammo -
nium removal should be 0.11 [38]. But the values in this 
study were a little higher than reported which indicated 
that the NOB started their growth. A study revealed the 
same result that some NOB also consumed nitrite [37]. So, 
it was assumed that at the beginning of the experiment the 
co-immobilized PN-anammox process combined well but 
on the later stage, a little number of NOB became active and H.A. Ahmad et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 164 (2019) 206–214209
consumed an amount of nitrite. The gel immobilization of 
PN-anammox sludge exhibited a better alternative to other 
techniques if the growth of NOB suppressed properly. The 
different strategies should be adopted to suppress the NOB 
growth in the latter stage. The heat-shock treatment was 
applied to suppress the growth of NOB, and some studies 
reported that heat-shock treatment had more detrimental 
effects over NOB as compared to AOB with a tempera -
ture above 60°C [39,40]. It was suggested that after the 
appearance of NOB activity heat-shock treatment should 
be verified on the PN-anammox process. Furthermore, the 
combined effects of free ammonia (FA), dissolved oxygen 
(DO), and heat-shock for immobilized biomass should also 
be verified in further research.
Overall, the combined process is more suitable for 
immobilized biomass. Previously, the establishment of PN/

anammox microorganisms took more than one and half 
months [41]. Further, different reactor configurations have 
been applied for the combined process of nitritation and 
anammox in singles reactor system. The major configura -
tions included the sequencing batch reactor (SBR), upflow 
granular system, moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). The 
nitrogen removal rate of 0.4 kg·N/m–3·d was achieved in a 
SBR system [42]. However, SBR system associated with two 
issues; firstly, the loss of biomass due to poor settling, and 
secondly, the aggregation of sludge may increase the floc 
size which affect the mixing operation [43]. In an up flow 
granular sludge reactor, a good removal efficiency was real -
ized [42]. However, up flow granular sludge system asso -
ciated with serious drawbacks. The system may cause the 
poor substrate transfer under lower up flow velocities [44]. 
At the same time insufficient mixing can also deteriorate the 
quality of effluent [15]. The gel immobilization is advanta -
geous because of low substrate diffusion constraints inside 
of the beads, no development of gas pocket inside the gel 
balls, and better settlement performance with mild stirring 
[25]. However, the NLR in our study was lower than the 
previous study and the period of study was also short. The 
future study is recommended for a longtime period (at least 
one year) to upgrade this technology in the full-scale nitro -
gen removal process.
3.3. Microbial metabolic activity 
It was reported that PN bacteria grew only on the sur -
face of biofilm due to easy access to the dissolved oxygen 
and ammonium [45]. The diffusion of ammonium and 
nitrite inside the gel beads may affect the activity of the 
immobilized cell. Moreover, the AOB on the surface of gel 
beads consumed oxygen to produce nitrite and provided 
the protection to anammox from oxygen inhibition, and 
subsequently, anammox consumed nitrite in the proximity 
area and avoided the inhibition of nitrite on anammox as 
well as AOB [30]. So, to investigate the metabolic activity of 
co-immobilized PN-Anammox sludge, the gel beads from 
the reactor were taken out, washed with deionized water 
then cut along the middle line position of the beads. Then, 
the bead slice was placed in the culture medium (synthetic 
wastewater) under the optical microscope to observe the 
profile of the metabolic activity of the combined process. 
After 15 min observation, bubbles appeared from the middle 
as well as from the surface of the beads (Fig. 3). The appear -ance of the gas bubbles indicated that the ammonium could 
be partially oxidized to nitrite by AOB and at the same time 
anammox utilized produced nitrite with remaining ammo -
nium to produce nitrogen gas. The results confirmed that the 
diffusion limitation of the substrate inside the beads should 
be overlooked. The FISH analysis was performed to identify 
the presence of anammox in the core of the beads [25]. But 
there is not report about the activity of PN-anammox inside 
the gel beads. The microscopic image of the gas bubbles for -
mation satisfied the simultaneous function of AOB and ana -
mmox inside the core as well as the surface of the beads. It is 
the first time to experimentally prove the activity of immo -
bilized PN-Anammox sludge inside the beads.
3.4. Cell apoptosis analysis
Generally, cell undergoes death by two ways, i.e. 
necrosis caused by some external forces and apoptosis 
(also called programmed cell death) due to some cellular 
phenomena. A study showed that the Trichodesmium spp., 
marine cyanobacteria experienced the programmed cell 
death under the phosphorus and nitrogen starvation [46]. 
In order to verify the existence and activity of nitrifying 
bacteria and anaerobic ammonium oxide bacteria in a 
large number of gel particles, the detection of immobilized 
sludge cells was carried out with apoptosis and necrosis 
assay kit in this experiment. The gel particles in the reactor 
were taken out and observed. The figure divided into live 
cell region and death cell region. The Q2-3 depicted the 
live cell region while Q3-2 showed death cell region. The 
cluster of the cell in both region characterized if there is 
any death phenomena inside of the beads. There were dis -
tinct clusters of cells in the active cell region of Q2-2 (Fig. 
4a), but there was no distinct cluster in Q2-3, indicating 
that there is no obvious death phenomenon inside of the 
gel beads and the cells could carry out their life activities 
in the immobilized reagent. The bacteria developed strate -
gies were helpful for bacteria to persist in the unfavorable 
environment for a long time [47]. To confirm that either 
the above description is true or not, the particles from the 
reactor were cultured in the non-nutritious environment. 
After three days the detection of the cell was carried out as 
shown in Fig. 4b. There were apparent clusters of cell in the 
live cell section Q4-3 as well as death cell region Q4-2. Fig. 
4b confirms that the substrate was easily diffused inside of 
the beads. Apoptosis was observed under the non-nutri -
tious environment. So, there was no environmental stress 
on the bacteria and bacteria could carry out the removal 
of nitrogen efficiently in the presence of substrate. If there 
were any substrate constrains in the core of the beads, the 
apoptosis analysis of the fresh beads would show the clus -
ter in the death cell region. The distinct difference between 
clusters of bacteria in the active cell region as well death 
cell region before and after the starvation treatment con -
firmed that bacteria were active in the core of the beads 
in the presence of essential substrate. The events similar 
to apoptosis were perceived in Staphylococcus pneumoniae  
when treated with HAMLET (a complex of milk lipid and 
protein) [48]. This is another confirmation of the immobi -
lized cell activity within the gel beads in a normal treat -
ment process with immobilized bacteria, and there was 
not any nutritious limitation within the gel balls.

3.5. Analysis of microbial community
In order to investigate the microbial community in 
the SNAP system, 16SrRNA-based pyrosequencing was 
used to evaluate the community composition and spe -
cific content of microbes. The microbial sample was col -
lected at the end of the experiment (day 54). The results 
of high-throughput sequencing analysis at three differ -
ent levels phylum, class, and genus are depicted in Fig. 
5 representing the microbial structure of the SNAP pro -
cess. At phylum level (Fig. 5a), the dominant phyla were 
in the order of Proteobacteria, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Firmic -
utes, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Nitro -
spirae, and Actinobacteria , accounting for about 94.44%.
Among them, the phylum Proteobacteria  occupied the 
proportion of 35.35%, and Planctomycetes shared about 
2.42%. Another study showed that bacteria involved in 
the SNAP reactor commonly consisted of above reported 
phylum [49]. Proteobacteria  was the most abundant phy -
lum in the anaerobic reactor fed with pretreated waste -
water [50]. The phylum Chlorobi and Chloroflexi were also 
reported in the partial nitritation and anammox system 
[37,51]. The phylum Chloroflexi consumed the soluble 
microbial product and decayed material of autotrophs 
[52,53]. Moreover, Fig. 5b showed the microbial distri -
bution of the system at the class level. The class Ignavi 
bacteria (18.94%) belonging to the phylum Chlorobi and 
the class belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria includ -
ing Betproteo bacteria  (18.94%) were the most abundant 
classes followed by Anaerolineae (13.97%) and the abun -
dance of other classes belong to the phylum Proteobac -
teria including Gammaproteo bacteria (8.07%), Deltaproteo 
bacteria (4.18%) and Alphaproteo bacteria (4.07%). The 
abundance of Betproteo bacteria  was more compared to 
the previous study [54] and less than that reported by 
[55]. The class Planctomycetacia is belonging to the phy -
lum Planctomycetes which includes anammox also pre -
sented with the abundance of 1.71%.Furthermore, the 
microbial community distribution of microorganisms 
at the genus level was shown in Fig. 5c. The relative 
abundance of Nitrosomonas (AOB) was 0.89% which 
was lower than that of Burkholderia (3.91%) and Candi -
datus Brocadia (1.33%). The lower abundance of AOB can provide required amount of nitrite for simultaneously 
anammox process, and was not limited step [56]. While 
to maintain the balance between AOB and anammox 
percentage is also problematic in suspended growth as 
well as biofilm system. Moreover, three more genera of 
anammox bacteria were also identified including Candi -
datus Kuenenia, Candidatus Jettenia, and Candidatus Nos -
tocoida . In sequencing batch reactor, the anammox strain 
Candidatus Brocadia  and nitrosomonas also reported in 
combined PN/Anammox process [57]. Candidatus Broca -
dia and Candidatus Kuenenia were spotted as the princi -
pal anammox genera in the laboratory scale reactor fed 
with synthetic wastewater [58]. A higher proportion of 
Candidatus Brocadia  compared to other anammox species 
may attribute to the higher growth rate of Candidatus 
Brocadia than other anammox species [59].
4. Conclusion
The study proved that immobilization of PN-anam -
mox is suitable to decrease the startup period compared 
to granulation and suspended growth system. The PN 
process made sure the availability of nitrite for the anam -
mox in the vicinity area. Anammox consumed nitrite from 
the PN process with remaining ammonia and released the 
nitrogen gas in the form of bubbles with the production 
of nitrate.
The apoptosis analysis is a good approach to know the 
activity of bacteria, providing information about the death 
and life of the bacteria. This approach can be applied in the 
granular system to know the behavior of granules in the 
system. Here, the apoptosis analysis proved that there was 
not any death phenomenon inside the beads which guaran -
teed the suitable environment and diffusion of the substrate 
inside of the beads for the growth of anammox. The phylum 
Proteobacteria (35.35%) was the most abundant among all 
other detected phyla while at genus level Candidatus Broca -
dia and Nitrosomonas were the primary anammox and partial 
nitrifying bacteria. Moreover, three more genera of anammox 
bacteria were also identified including Candidatus Kuenenia, 
Candidatus Jettenia, and Candidatus Nostocoida. The Candidatus 
Brocadia have advantage of higher growth rate as compared

to other genera of anammox, which could increase the abun -
dance of Candidatus Brocadia in the SNAP system.
