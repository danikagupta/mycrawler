Subject:  Revised Draft Hair Dye Epidemiology Document  for Posting  
 
Enclosed is the latest  draft of the CIR Expert Panel Hair Dye Epidemiology document  (Document) .  The enclosed  draft is 
identified as hdepi 062018 rep.  The previous  draft was reviewed by the Panel at the December  2017 meeting.  At the December  
meeting, the Panel requested the inclusion of additional studies regarding breast cancer incidences  and concluded that the services 
of an expert epidemiologist, with experience specifically relevant to factors associated with breast cancer, should be retain ed to 
summarize the differences the differences in study results.  The enclosed evaluation,  from Dr. Luigi Naldi,  is identified as  
hdyepi062018com .    Since then, however, two  additional studies  regarding the association between hair dyes and the risk of 
breast cancer, and a study regarding the potential association of prostate cancer with hair dye use, have been dis covered. Dr. 
Naldi’s analysis and these additional studies  are incorporated herein, highlighted in yellow , for the Panel’s consideration.   
 
The Panel should review this D ocument, especially noting the additions, and decide if this G uidance Document  is in agreement 
with their thinking and is ready to be finalized.  If the Document is not considered to be ready for finalization, specific needs 
therein should be made evident.

 1 HAIR DYE EPIDEMIOLOGY  – through June , 2018 
 
 
Hair dyes may be broadly grouped into oxidative (permanent) and direct (semi -permanent)  dyes.  The oxidative 
dyes consist of precursors mixed with developers to produce color, while direct dyes  consist of  preformed color s.  
 
Epidemiology studies that seek to determine links, if any, between hair dye use and disease  provide broad 
information and have been con sidered by the CIR Expert Panel, although these studies do not specifically address the safety 
of individual hair dye ingredients.    
 
The following provides a brief summary of many relevant epidemiological studies that have been published since 
about 2010, as well as older epidemiological studies that were included in comprehensive reviews, such as that published 
by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 20101. 
 
Conclusion  
 
The CIR Expert Panel determined that the available hair dye epidemiology data do not provide sufficient evidence 
for a causal relationship between personal hair dye use and cancer, based on the lack of strength of the associations and 
inconsistency of the findings.  In addition, the Panel noted that there was no consistent pattern of genotype/phenotype 
influence on hair dye epidemiology findings.  
 Background  
 
The CIR Expert Panel reviews  new epidemiological studies addressing the personal  use of hair dyes  as these 
studies become available.  Table 1 summarizes the studies  specifically addressing bladder cancer , lymphoma , and 
leukemia  and breast cancer .  Relevant meta -analytical studies included here address glioma and breast cancer, in addition 
to bladder and blood cancers.  Occupation as a hairdresser, barber, or cosmetologist involves exposures to multiple 
products used during work, making it difficult to use the results of such studies to inform the assessment of the risk, if an y, 
associated specifically with hair dyes.  Accordingly, such studies are not summarized here.   
 
The CIR Expert Panel considers that epidemiological studies , based on  better information about exposure , can 
provide more useful findings  than other such studies .  Rollison et al. (2006) noted that exposure assessment s in hair dye 
epidemiology studies  ranged from minimal information  (e.g., ever/never use ) to subject -recalled information on type, color, 
duration and frequency of use .
2  These authors developed a scale from + to ++++ to score the quality of hair dye exposure 
assessment s in hair dye epidemiology studies .  This scale was used to score the studies that are summarized in Table 1. 
 
An IARC working group summarized the relevant epidemiology studies and observations on breast, bladder and 
hematological cancers .1,3  The  working group concluded that the data are of insufficient quality, consistency, or statistical 
power to establish  the presence or absence of a causal link between personal use of hair dyes and cancer.  They also 
conc luded that the animal studies provided limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of hair colorants .  Occupational 
exposure during work as a hairdresser, barber, or beautician was also assessed.  The working group found that exposures 
from these occupat ions are probably carcinogenic, based on limited evidence of increased risk for bladder cancer in hair 
dressers and barbers.  
 
The studies herein result in either an odds ratio or a relative risk, two similar but not synonymous terms.  An odds 
ratio (OR) represents the odds that an outcome (e.g. cancer) will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of 
the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure; whereas a relative risk (RR) is a measure of the risk of a certain 
event happening in one group compared to the risk of the same event happening in another group.4,5  In cancer research, 
ORs are most often used in case -control (backward looking) studies, and RRs are used in prospective (forward looking) 
studies, such as cohort studies and clinical trial s.   An OR of 1 means that an exposure does not affects the odds of an 
outcome (i.e. does not increase the risk of cancer), while a RR of 1 means there is no difference between two groups in terms of risk following a particular exposure.  However, either an OR or RR > 1 means the exposure may increase the risk 
of disease.

 2 Bladder Cancer  
 
 Turati et al. (2014) performed a meta -analysis of 15 case- control and 2 cohort studies.6  The abstracted 
information included the variables adjusted and/or used to match control subjects with cases.  For example, 12 of the 
studies clearly adjusted for smoking ; adjustment for smoking was not clear in 1 study.  The pooled RR of bladder cancer 
incidence/mortality was 0.93 (95% confidence interval ( CI) 0.83- 1.05) for personal use of any type of hair dye, compared 
with no use, and similar results were obtained when the subjects were stratified by sex.  The RR for personal use of permanent hair dyes  from 7 of the studies was 0.92 (95% CI 0.77- 1.09).  Similarly, no association was found between 
bladder cancer and the duration or lifetime frequency of use of any type of hair dye or use of permanent hair dyes, 
compared with never used hair dyes.  The RR  for the use of dark -color hair dyes was 1.29 (95% CI 0.98- 1.71).  
  Ros et al. (2012)  performed a population -based case -control study  of hair dye use and bladder cancer in t he 
Netherlands .
7  The subjects were 246 cases and 2587 controls; all of the subjects for which the analyses were performed 
were women (less than 5% of the men selected for the study reported ever using hair dyes).  The hair dye e xposure 
assessment  was ++++ on the Rollison et al. (2006) scale.   All analyses were adjusted for age and smoking status, duration 
and intensity.  Additional adjustment for education level and other variables considered were not included in the final 
model because they did not change the standardized regression coefficient (β) by more than 10%.   No association was 
found between bladder cancer and ever use of permanent hair dyes (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.65 -1.18) or temporary hair dyes 
(OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.58- 1.02).  Similarly, no association was observed when hair dye use was defined by type, duration or 
frequency of use, dye color, or extent of use or when the patients were stratifi ed by aggressive and non -aggressive bladder 
cancers.   
 
Koutros et al. (2011) conducted a p opulation -based case- control study in Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire.8  
The subjects were 1 ,193 cases of urinary bladder cancer diagnosed from 2001 to 2004 (911 male and 282 female) , and 1418 
controls (1 ,039 male and 379 female).  The hair dye e xposure assessment  was ++++ on the Rollison et al. (2006) scale.   
The hair dye models were adjusted for age, race, sex, and smoking status.  
 
No association was found between ever/never use of hair dyes and bladder cancer – the OR a nd associated 95% CI 
for women was 0.7 (95% CI 0.5- 1.0), and for  men 0.7 (95% CI 0.4- 1.0).  Because of the excellent exposure assessment, 
the authors were able to examine  subsets of the population studied.  Women who used red hair colors, for example, 
exhibited an OR of 0.4 (95% CI 0.2- 0.8), suggesting a significantly lower risk of bladder cancer associated with the use of 
such hair dyes.  A similar lower risk of bladde r cancer was reported for women who used hair dyes for a duration between 
10 and 19 years  (OR 0.5 ; 95% CI 0.27- 0.79).  As the data were further analyzed, the authors considered women with and 
without college degrees.  Women without college degrees who used permanent hair dyes  exclusively , for example, had a 
significantly lower risk of bla dder cancer  (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.4- 0.7).  Exclusive use of permanent hair dyes by women 
with colleg e degrees was associated with a significantly higher risk of bladder cancer  (OR 4.9 ; 95% CI 1.7- 14.6).  No 
statistically -significant interaction s with hair -dye use were found when the data were stratified by state of residence, 
hair-dye product type, smoking, age at diagnosis/interview, or disease aggressiveness in the female subjects.  
  
 Shakhssalim et al. (2010) reported a population -based case- control study o f several likely risk factors for  bladder 
cancer in Iran with 692 cases and 692 controls.9  Cases were identified using the Iranian cancer registry.  The hair dye 
exposure assessment was a + on the Rollison et al. (2006) scale.  The OR for hair dye use and bladder cancer was  1.81 
(95% CI 1.08- 3.06).  After adjustment for cigarette sm oking,  the OR was 1.99 (95% CI 1.02- 3.82).  When women and 
men were analyzed separately, no  significant association with hair dye use  and bladder cancer was found .  
 
Prostate Cancer  
 Tai et al. (2016)  reported a hospital -based case -control study of hair dye use and prostate cancer  in Taiwan.10  
The subjects were 296 cases with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and 296 age- , ethnicity -, and hospital -matched controls.   
Information on hair dye use was obtained through a standardized questionnaire.   The prevalence of hair dye use was 
higher in the cases than the controls (95/296 = 32.1% vs. 64/296 = 21.6%, p < 0.05), and the hair dye users had increased 
odds of prostate cancer when compared with the non -users (adjusted OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.32– 3.57) .  The study found 
personal hair dye use increase d risk of prostate cancer with a dose- response effect.  Meanwhile, to determine the rate of 
prostate cancer survival, another 608 in cident prostate cancer cases  were investigated.   Of the 608 cases, 26.4% (161 /608) 
reported having used hair dyes.   The use of hair dye did not affect cumulative incidence estimates of prostate 
cancer -specific deaths (p=0.753).

 3     This report was the first to show a positive association between personal hair dye use and risk of prostate 
cancer , revealing a dose- response relationship in terms of duration and frequency; however, cumulative exposure dose, a 
critical indicator to estimate a  dose-response effect , was not assessed.   The external validity of this study has been 
questioned .11  Other studies targeted on hairdressers observed no increased risk of prostate cancer .12  While Tai et al.’s 
findings are limited  and do not represent evidence for the presence of a cause -effect relationship, further investigations may 
be warranted.  
 
 Lymphoma and Leukemia  
  Towle et al.  (2017)  conducted a meta -analysis of 20 case- control studies of leukemia.
13  The RRs for the 
associated risk of leukemia were: with permanent hair dye use RR = 1.19 (95% CI 1.07 –1.33), with dark hair dye use R R = 
1.29 (95% CI 1.11– 1.50), with hair dye use among males RR = 1.42 (95% CI: 1.01– 2.00), with hair dye use pre -1980 RR = 
1.49 (95% CI: 1.21– 1.83), and with hair dye use for longer than 15 years RR = 1.35 (95% CI: 1.13– 1.62). Overall, findings 
suggest that  ever use of hair dye is not a significant risk factor for leukemia .  
 
Parodi et al. (2016)  performed a population -based case -control study of leukemia and non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL) in Italy.14  The analysis was restricted to women in the population studies because too few of the men reported any 
hair dye use.  There were 161 cases ( 120 lymphoid  and 41 myeloid) and 84 controls  among the women.  The evaluation 
of hair dye exposure was a + on the Rollison et al. (2006)  scale, because only duration of hair dye use < 15 years vs. ≥ 15 
years was evaluated.  I n a multivariate analysis, the OR was 2.3 (95% CI 1.0 -4.9), with p = 0.036 for a trend , for NHL in 
women using hair dye for at least 15 years.   No association was found between lymphoid malignancies and tobacco 
smoking or the consumption of alcoholic beverages in this study.  
  Linet et al (2014)  conducted a meta -analysis of 19 case -control studies of  NHL subtypes, focusing on f ollicular 
lymphoma  (FL).
15  No associations between FL and hair dye use type, duration, or frequency were found in this study, 
except fo r a modest increase in women who used hair dyes before 1980 (OR  = 1.4; 95% CI 1.10- 1.78).   Many oxidative  
hair dye products were reformulated in the early 1980s  in the U.S.  to eliminate ingredients that produced tumors in animal 
bioassay s.16  In comparison, the risk of FL in women was associated with current cigarette smoking, trending higher with 
increasing duration of smoking.   Cerhan et al. (2014)  performed a meta -analysis of 19 case -control studies of NHL subtypes, focusing on diffuse 
large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
17  There were no overall and sex - or age-specific associations between DLBCL and hair 
dye use, based on the basic adjusted model results  of this study .  The OR for mediastinal DLBCL was 4.97 (95% CI 
1.63- 15.15) for use of hair dyes for at least 20 years, compared with never use d hair dyes .  Using hair dye s for at least 20 
years was not associated with DCBCL at other anatomical sites , including the central nervous system (CNS) , testis, 
gastrointestinal tract, and skin.   Use of hair dyes for less than 20 years was not associated with DLBCL at any site.  In 
comparison, smoking was associated with CNS , testicular and cutaneous DLBCLs in this study.  
 
Salem et al. (201 4) conducted a hospital -based case- control study of leukemia and lymphoma in Egypt.18  There 
were 130 cases, including 23 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 107 cases of NHL, and 1 30 age- and 
sex-matched controls.  The evaluation of hair dye exposure was a + on the Rollison et al. (2006)  scale.   In a univariate 
analysis, no statistically significant association was found between these lymphoproliferative disorders and history of using  
hair dyes , family history of cancer, exposure to X- rays, or smoking (χ2, p>0.05).  
  Lv et al. (2010) conducted a hospital -based case -control study of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS s) in China.
19  
There were 403 cases and 806 controls, and the evaluation of hair dye expo sure was a ++ on the Rollison et al. (2006) scale.  
In a univariate analysis, the OR for hair dye use (≥  2 times per year) and all MDS s was 1.46 (95% CI 1.03- 2.07).  In a 
multivariate analysis  performed to adjust for potential confounding factors , the OR w as not statistically significant (OR 
1.31; 95% CI 0.88 -1.93).   In comparison, smoking was associated with the development of MDSs in the univariate 
analysis and with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) in both the univariate and multivariate analys es. 
 
 W
ong et al. (2010) conducted a hospital -based case- control study of NHL in Shanghai .20  There were 649 cases 
and 1 ,298 controls, and the evaluation of hair dye exposure was a ++ on the Rollison et al. (2006) scale.  No increased risk 
of NHL  was reported  (OR 0.93 ; 95% CI 0.75- 1.16).  For CLL  and small lymphocytic lymphoma  (SLL ), the authors 
reported a significantly lower risk associated with hair dye use ( OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18- 0.76).  In comparison, alcohol

 4 consumption and cigarette smoking were not associated with NHL in this study, although smoking ≤ 20 years (but not > 20 
years) was associat ed with precursor B -cell neoplasms.  
 
 Chang et al. (2010) re -evaluated tissue samples from a NHL  case- control study in males from Iowa and Minnesota 
using FISH  (fluorescence in situ  hybridization ) cytogenetic  technique  to evaluate both t (14;18) -positive and 
t(14;18) -negative NHL subtypes  and IHC (immunohistochemistry) assays to evaluate expression of the anti -apoptotic 
protein bcl -2.21  There were 8 t(14;18) -positive, 12 t(14;18) -negative, 20 bcl -2 positive, and 4 bcl -2 negative NHL cases 
and 58 control subjects in the subpopulation tested (i.e., men having used hair dye at least once a month for at least one year, or occupational exposure to hair dyes on any job held for at least a year).   The evaluation of hair dye exposure scored  
+ on the Rollison et al. (2006) scale.  Adjusting for age, state and proxy status (i.e., whether or not next -of-kin proxies 
were interviewed), a statistically -significant  association between ever/never use of hair dy es and t (14;18) -negative NHL 
(OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.6- 5.0) and bcl -2 positive NHL (R 2.2; 95% CI 1.4- 3.4), but no t with t(14;18) -positive NHL  (OR 1.3; 
95% CI 0.6- 2.6) or bcl -2 negative NHL (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.5- 3.8).  Similarly, smoking was associated with 
t(14;18) -negative NHL, but not clearly associated with t (14;18) -positive NHL , bcl-2 negative  NHL, or bcl -2 positive NHL  
in this study.  
 
Wong et al. (2009) reported a hospital -based case- control study of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Shanghai.
22  
There were 722 cases and 1 ,444 age- and sex- matched controls .  T he evaluation of hair dye exposure was a ++ on the 
Rollison et al. (2006) scale.  The study found no increase in the risk of AML and personal use of hair dyes; The OR was 
0.98 (95% CI 0.8- 1.2).  In contrast, there was an association between AML and smoking, particularly among the male 
subjects, as well as alcohol consumption and a low level of education in this study.  
 Glioma  
  Shao et al. (2013) performed a meta -analysis of 4 case -control and 2 cohort studies of personal hair dye use and 
the incidence of gliomas.
23  Matching or adjustment for age and sex was performed in all 6 studies included in this 
meta -analysis, and for smoking in 2 of the 6 studies.  The most adjusted risk estimates were included, and the raw data 
were used when adjusted estimates were not available.  Summary RRs for ever use of any hair dyes were 1.132 (95% CI 0.887- 1.446) for all studies, 1.291 (95% CI 0.937- 1.777) for case -control studies, and 0.903 (95% CI 0.774- 1.054) f or 
cohort studies.  Similar results were obtained when the subjects were stratified by geographic regions and sex.  No significant associations were found among the studies that evaluated permanent hair dye use and duration of any hair dye use. 
 Breast Can cer 
 
 Llanos et al. (2017) conducted a population -based case -control study of hair dye use and breast cancer in African 
American and European American  women in the Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS).
24  The subjects were 1508 
African American and 772 European American  cases  (52±10.7 and 52.0±10.0 years old, respectively) and 1290 African 
American and 71 5 European American age - and county -matched control subjects  (50.9±10.3 and 49.8±8.7 years old, 
respectively) .  The evaluation of hair dye exposure was ++++ o n the Rollison et al. (2006) scale).   The final multivariate 
model included age, education, body -mass index (BMI), family history of breast cancer , and oral contraceptive use; age at 
menarche, parity and hormone -replacement therapy were omitted based on statistical analysis (p > 0.1).  In the 
multivariate analysis, the OR s for breast cancer were 1.52 (95% CI 1.21- 1.91), 1.30 (95% CI 1.03- 1.63), and 2.21 (95% CI 
1.26- 3.86), respectively, for African American women who reported using dark permanent hair dyes, African American 
women who typically had their hair dyed in a salon (rather than using a home kit), and European American  women who 
had a history of both hair dyes and chemical hair relaxers, compared with matched controls who never used hair dyes.   
Use of dark dyes among both African American and European American women and dual use of hair dyes among European 
women were associated with estrogen -receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (OR=1.72, 95% CI 1.30 -2.26; 1.36, 95% CI 
1.01- 1.84), and 2. 40, 95% CI 1. 35-4.27, respectively ).  In this study, women who started using hair dyes before 1980 were 
not distinguished from women who started in 1980 or thereafter.  
 
Heikkinen et al. (2015)  performed a population -based case -control study of hair dye use and breast cancer in 
Finland.25  The subjects were 6,567 breast cancer patients and 21,598 age- matched controls.   The evaluation of hair dye 
exposure was a +++ on the Rollison et al. (2006) scale.   The multivariate model was adjusted for parity, age at first birth, 
family history of breast cancer, menarche age, use of hormonal contraceptives, physical activity, alcohol use, BMI and educ ation.   The OR for breast cancer was 1.23 (95% CI 1.11 -1.36) for women who ever used hair dyes, compared with 
Distributed For Comment Only -- Do Not Cite or Quote  
 5 those who never used hair dyes; the analogous ORs were 1.28 (95% CI 1.10- 1.48) for women born before 1950 and 1.14 
(95% CI 0.85- 1.54) for women born in 1960 or later.   Logistical regression analysis indicated that there was a 
statistically -significant trend (p=0.005) in the ORs calculated for number of hair dye episodes (1.07 for 1- 2 episodes vs. 
1.35 for 35- 89 episodes).   The ORs did not change w hen smoking was included in the multivariate analysis.  
 
Takkouche et al. (2005) conducted a meta -analysis of epidemiological studies of hair dye use and cancer risks, 
including 12 case -control studies and 2 cohort studies of breast cancer.12  The adjustment, m atching and/or restriction 
factors included age in all 14 studies, smoking in 6 studies, education in 2 studies, and alcohol consumption in 1 study 
evaluated in this meta -analysis.   The random -effects p ooled RR estimated from all 14 studies for ever users was 1.06 
(95% CI 0.95- 1.18).  Likewise, ORs calculated for ever used vs. never used hair dyes specifically from case -control 
studies, cohort studies, or permanent hair dye use only, or for intensive exposure (i.e., more than 200 lifetime exposures) 
were no t statistically significantly.  
 Mendelsohn et al. (2009) conducted a  prospective cohort study of ever hair dye use and cancer risks of women in 
China, including cases of breast cancer with 234 hair dye users and 358 non -users.
26  The results were derived using Cox 
proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, education  and smoking duration .  The average number of person years was 
7.31.  The RR for breast cancer was 0.93 (95% CI 0.78- 1.09) for women who ever used hair dyes, compared with those 
who never used hair dyes .  No significant association was observed between hair dye use and the risk of breast cancer.  
Stratification by menopausal status  indicated no association between breast cancer and hair dye use in either pre- or 
post-menopausal women.   
 Kinlen et al. (1977) conducted a case- control study of 191 breast cancer patients interviewed in a hospital in 1975 
-1976 in Oxford, UK, with 561 aged matched controls wi thout cancer (within three years), marital status, and social class.
27  
Seventy- three cases and 213 controls had used permanent or semi -permanent hair dyes, giving an RR of 1.01. There was no 
evidence of an increasing risk for breast cancer with increasing duration of use of hair dyes or with use beginning more than four or more than nine years before diagnosis.  
 Stavraky et al. (1979) conducted a case- control study of 50 breast cancer patients at a cancer treatment center with  
100 hospitalized controls in London, Ontario, and 35 breast cancer cases with  70 neighborhood controls in Toronto, 
Ontario, with respect to hair -dye use.
28  The RRs for breast cancer from use of permanent hair dyes  (at any time) were 1.3 
(95% CI  0.6-2.5) in London and 1.1 (0.5- 2.4) in Toronto.  Further statistical analyses, allowing for smoking habits, family 
history of cancer and age at first birth, showed no significant relationship between hair -dye use and breast cancer incidence.  
  Koenig et al. (1991) conducted a case control study of 398 breast cancer patients at a screening center betw een 
1977 and 1981 in Ne w York City, with 90 randomly selected, age matched  controls .
29  The OR for breast cancer from use 
of permanent hair dyes (at any time) was 0.8 (95% CI 0.6- 1.1).  There was also no evidence of a trend in risk with 
increasing number of hair dye uses (38% of the subjects had used hair dye at least 100 times, while 77% had used hair dyes at least once). An analysis of breast cancer risk from 5 or more years of work as a beautician was also compared.  Although personal hair dye use was unrelated to breast cancer risk, the OR for beauticians was 3.0 (95% CI 1.1 -7.8). 
 
According to an analysis by Naldi  (2018),  the available evidence linking hair dye use and breast cancer is limited.  
Based on the available human evidence, personal use of hair dyes is unlikely to be an important risk factor for breast 
cancer.30  However, concerns are warranted on  two recent studies that pointed  to an increased risk in different ethnic 
groups and populations, Africa n Americans, White American women, and Finnish women.24,31  One system atic review ,12 
two case -control studies ,24,31 and one cohort study,26 all published  after 2004, were included in  Naldi’s evaluation .  
Strengths of these epidemiologic studies include evaluation of a variety of populations , while  limitations of some of the 
studies include  lack of specificity for type of hair dyes used (oxidative versus no n-oxidative) and details on color, type, or 
duration of use.  In addition, it is worthy to note that hair dye  formulations  have changed over time, and they differ based 
on the region of the world in which they are produced and sold.  Hence the specific product used and the timing of use 
should be better considered.30  Comments from Naldi on the recent epidemiology studies  that investigated the association 
between hair dye use and breast cancer  are summarized  below .   
 
1) The systematic review  (Takkouche et al., 2005) summarizes  results of studies conducted from 1966 up to 
January 2005,12 and includes twelve  case-control studies ,27-29,32-40 which involved a total of 5019 cases and 
8486 controls, and two  cohort studies which recruited a total of 1135 incident cases of breast cancer .41,42  The 
pooled RR  of breast cancer was close to 1 and nonsignificant when comparing ever use vs. never use of hair

 6 dyes.   No significant increased risk was documented when considering intensive exposure or restricting 
analyses to the use of permanent dyes only.   It is noted that , giving the  largely prevalent use of hair dyes in 
the population, frequency of use rather than simple distinction between users and nonusers, would be relevant 
to consider.    
 
2) In the  cohort study ( Mendelsohn et al., 2009 ) conducted in the framework of the Shanghai Women's Health 
Study, a total of 75221 women completed a baseline survey between 1996 and 2000 and were followed up to 
December 2005.26  In the sample, 29076 women ( 39.6%) reported ever using hair dye and a total of 358 
incident cases of breast cancer were identified.  The RR for breast cancer in hair dye users vs non -users, 
adjusted by age, education and smoking, was close to 1 .  No relation was documented between du ration of 
hair dye use and risk of cancer .  However, information on the type of hair dye used (permanent vs 
semi -permanent) and  about the frequency of use  was not provided.  Moreover, exposure was assessed over 
the 3 years preceding the baseline interview only.  Hence , a potential misclassification may tend to minimize 
the presence of association  regardless of whether the association is positive or negative (i.e., bias toward the 
null).  
 
3) In the  case-control study  (Llanos et al., 2017) conducted in the metropolitan New York City area and in  ten 
counties in New Jersey, involving both African Americans and White women, a total of 2,280 cases and 2,005 
controls were enrolled .24  Final OR estimates were adjusted by age, education, body mass index, family 
history of breast cancer, and oral contraceptive use.  Overall, ever use of hair dyes and duration of use were 
not significantly associated with increased cancer risk in both African Americans and Whites.  Among 
African Americans, an increased risk of breast cancer was documented for the use of dark hair dye s hades, 
and for salon application of dyes, adjusted OR being 1.51 (95% CI, 1.20- 1.9) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00- 1.58), 
respectively.  In Whites, an increased risk was documented for dual use of relaxers and hair dyes with OR 
2.40 (95% CI 1.35- 4.27), the wide CI  reflecting the limited number of exposed women.  When considering 
the estrogen receptor status of cancer, the risk of estrogen positive breast cancer was increased  in African 
Americans with a higher frequency of hair dye use (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 -1.84) an d in Whites with the use of 
dark hair dye shades (OR 1.54, 95% CI, 1.01- 2.33).  These differences in risk profile between African 
Americans and Whites are not easy to reconcile.  They may reflect different patterns of use, or  represent 
chance effects due t o multiple testing.  Replication of results by an independent study is needed.  
 
4) The population based case- control study in Finland (Heikkinen, et al., 2015) recruited a total of 6,567 breast 
cancer patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 and 21,598 age -matched controls.31  When calculating 
ORs, potential confounding factors, namely parity, age at first birth, family history of breast cancer, menarche 
age, use of hormonal contraceptives, physical activity,  alcohol use, body mass index  and education, were 
included in a stepwise regression model.  The OR increased significantly with the increase in number of 
reported hair dye episodes, from 1.07 with 1– 2 dye episodes up to 1.31 for 35– 89 dye episodes.  Early age at 
first dye (20 –29 years) was associated with higher odds of breast cancer when compared to late age at first 
dye (40 years or later) (OR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05 –1.25).   When considering ever use vs . non-use, the ORs were 
increased with all the different types of hair dyes, the highest estimates being obtained for women who 
reported to have used temporary and/or semi -permanent dyes, ORs being 1.32 (95% CI: 1.16– 1.52) and 1.31 
(95% CI: 1.17 –1.46), respectively.           
 
The following two studies were discov ered after Naldi’s analysis.  While these studies were not subjected to the 
same valuation, these  results seem to share the same limitations, such as a lack of specificity for type of hair dyes used 
(oxidative versus non- oxidative) and details on c olor, type, or duration of use.  
 
Dianatinasab et al. (2017) conducted a hospital -based case- control study of breast cancer on 1052 women in Iran.44  
There were 526 newly  diagnosed breast cancer cases, with 526 age- matched controls randomly selected in Namazi Hospital 
between November 2014 and March 2016.  The study showed that multiple factors contribute to the risk of breast cancer, 
such as hair coloring, stress, and smo king.  The OR of breast cancer from hair dye use on a regular basis compared to no 
use was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.41- 2.62).  
 
Gera et al. (2018)  conducted a meta -analysis of epidemiological studies that investigated the association between 
hair dye use and breast cancer , including eight  case-control studies  published between 1980 and 2017 with  a total of 38037 
participants .43  Among them, six studied have already been  evaluated in the meta -analysis conducted by Takkouche et al.

 7 (2015) ,29,33-35,39,40 in addition to  Dianatinasab et al. ’s report mentioned above .44  However, the other eight studies covered  
by Takkouche et al.’s paper  were excluded  from this meta -analysis .  Note that six of the se eight excluded studies  did not 
suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in users of hair  dye.27,28,32,38,41,42  The exclusion criteria includes, but is not 
limited to: (1) breast cancer was not the sole  focus of investigation  (i.e., studies examining any non- breast related cancer as 
a case were excluded ); (2) studies failed to provide overall or accurate RR and 95% CI; (3)  studies failed to adequately 
control for confounding factors; (4) studies with small sample size.43  Using a random effects model and the Duval and 
Tweedie’s trim and fill procedure to adj ust for publication bias in the presence o f between studies heterogeneity, such 
meta -analysis showed that RR for women using hair dyes  was 1.1 88 (95% CI 1.03- 1.37), which indicates  an 18.8% 
increased risk of future development of breast cancer among hair dye users.   While these findings do not represent 
evidence for the presence of a cause -effect relationship, further investigations may be  warranted.  
 
Genetic Polymor phisms  
 
NAT1, NAT2, GSTM1, and GSTT1 Genotype/Phenotype  
   The study by Koutros et al. (2011) is the latest in a series of studies that have examined the influence of genotype 
and phenotype of liver enzymes that may activate or inactivate potential carcinogens.
8    
  
 NAT1 and NAT2 genes encode arylamine N -acetyltransferases that can deactivate (or, less commonly, potentially 
activate) arylamine and hydrazine  chemicals.  Polymorphisms in these  gene s determine, in part, the  liver-function 
phenotypes.  H uman populations segregate into rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylator  phenotypes .  N-acetylation is a 
major route of biotransformation of aromatic amine compounds,  including those found in hair dyes.  
  The GSTM1 gene encodes a cytoplasmic glutathione S -transferase that belongs to the µ class, which functions in 
the detoxification of electrophilic compounds  (including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxicants , and 
products of oxidative stress ) through conjugation with glutathione.  The GSTT 1 gene encodes the glutathione 
S-transferase that belongs to the θ  class , which catalyze s the conjugation of reduced glutathione to a variety of electrophilic 
and hydrophobic compounds.  Genetic  polymorphisms in GSTM1 and GSTT1 also may affect the metabolis m of the 
constituents of hair dyes.  
 
Koutros et al. (2011) performed genotyping for  NAT2 , NAT1, GSTM1, and GSTT 1.
8  The hair dye models were 
adjusted for age, race, sex, and smoking status.  An increased risk of  bladder cancer  was reported  primarily among 
exclusive users of permanent dyes who had NAT2 slow -acetylation phenotypes , compared to never users of dye with 
NAT2 rapid/intermediate -acetylation phenotypes .  This increase was observed  in females with a college degree, but the 
difference was not statistically significant.  The authors concluded that NAT1 , GSTM1 , and GSTT1  genotypes did not 
appear to be important modifiers of the association  between ever, permanent, or exclusive permanen t hair dye  use and 
bladder cancer .  
 
 Gago -Dominguez et al. (2003)  reported that individuals with the NAT2 slow -acetylator phenotype who 
exclusively used permanent hair dyes had an increased risk of bladder cancer ( OR 2.9 ; 95% CI 1.3- 7.5) after adjustment for 
cigarette smoking,  compared to individuals with the NAT2 rapid- acetylator phenotypes  (OR 1.3; 95% CI 0.6- 2.8).45  The 
NAT*10 allele contains an altered polyadenylation signal that has been associated with elevated DNA adduct levels and greater risk of bladder cancer in other studies.   Individuals with a NAT1*10 genotype who were non -smokers and used 
permanent hair dyes exclusively had an O R of 1.0 (95% CI 0.2- 4.3), and those with a non -NAT1*10 genotype had an OR  
of 6.8 (95% CI 1.7- 27.4)  in this study . 
 
 Kogevinas et al. (2006) evaluated the association of hair dye use with bladder cancer among females in a 
case- control study  that also examined the effect of hair -dye use among genetic subgroups .
46  ORs were estimated after 
adjustment for age, region, and smoking.   No statistically significant differences in bladder cancer incidence were noted as 
a function of any of the genotypes examined,  including those with slow - or intermediate/rapid -NAT2 acetylator 
phenotypes.   For NAT2 slow -acetylator phenotypes, the OR was 0.6 (95% CI 0.3- 1.4), and for NAT2 rapid/intermediate 
phenotypes, the OR was 0.9 (95% CI 0.3- 2.6).  Individuals with a NAT1*10 genotype had an OR of 2.9 (95% CI 
0.7-11.6) , and those with non -NAT1*10 had an OR of 0.6 (95% CI 0.2- 1.6).  T hese findings were directionally  opposite to 
those of  Gago -Dominguez et al. (2003).45

 8  Morton et al. (2007) conducted a population- based case- control study of NHL .47  Subjects were identified among 
residents of 4 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result s (SEER) reg istries (Iowa, Los A ngeles County, and metropolitan 
Detroit and Seattle).  There were 101 cases and 98 control subjects reporting no use of hair coloring products and 509 
cases and 413 control subjects among the women reporting use of such products, in the  population studied.  There were 
317 cases and 269 control subjects reporting the use of hair dyes before 1980 and 192 cases and 148 controls reporting hair 
dye use in 1980 or thereafter.   The risk estimates were adjusted for age, sex, race and SEER area; e ducation, smoking 
status, history of farming, having a first -degree r elative with a history of NHL or  lymphoproliferative malignancy were 
excluded from the final models because these factors did not materially alter (> 10%) the parameter estimates.  
 
Among the women who started using  permanent , intense -tone hair dyes before 1980, those w ith the NAT2  
slow -acetylator phenotype (23 cases/14 controls)  or who had no copies of the NAT1*10 allele  (26 cases/16 controls)  did 
not have an increased risk of NHL  (OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.6 -3.6 and OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.7 -3.3, respectively) .  Likewise, women 
in this subpopulation with 1 or 2 copies of the NAT1*10  allele (22 cases/10 controls) did not have an increased NHL risk 
(OR 2.5; 95% CI 0.9 -7.6, respectively) .  However, women with the NAT2  rapid/intermediate -acetylator phenotype who 
started using s uch dyes before 1980 (25 cases/11 controls ) did exhibit a potentially  increased NHL risk (OR 3.3; 95% CI 
1.3-8.6).  There was no evidence of increased risk among women who began  using hair dyes after 1980.  
  Zhang et al. (2009) re -evaluated data from a case -control study of NHL  in Connecticut (Zhang et al. 2004) to 
consider NAT1 and NAT2 genotype/phenotype and 17 other si ngle nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) .
48,49  The s ubjects , 
including 461 cases and 535 control subject s, were identified from the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Rapid Case 
Ascertainment Shared Resource (RCASR).  Potentially confounding variables included in the final model were age and race.  Adjustment for cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and farming history were not included in the fina l models 
because these factors did not materially alter the parameter estimates.  
 
With the exception of FL , none of the  different individual genes  examined  was associated with a 
statistically -significant change in the risk of NHL  for any  of the  NHL subtypes  considered .  The exception was a 
statistically -significant increase in the risk of FL in women with rapid/intermediate NAT2 phenotypes who started to use 
hair dye before 1980, compared with women who never used hair dye  (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.1 -7.2; 24 rapid/intermediate  
acetylator cases  vs. 79 control subjects ).  In women who carried the CYP2C9  allele (TT or CT genotypes) and started to 
use hair dyes before 1980,  there was an increased risk of NHL in general ( OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.4 -6.1; 58 cases, 43 control 
subjects) and the follicular lymphoma subtype specifically (OR 6.3; 95% CI 1.6 -24.7; 20 cases, 43 control subjects), 
compared with women who never used hair dyes  and women who started using hair dyes in 1980 or thereafter.  No 
association evident in women who carried the CYP2C9 allele (TT or CT genotypes) and started using hair dyes in 1980 or 
thereafter  (23 cases, 46 control subjects), compared with women who carried this allele and never used hair dyes (OR 1.0; 
95% CI 0.4-2.3; 23 cases, 46  control subjects ).   
 DNA Repair -Enzyme Genes  
 
Guo et al. (2014) investigated the interaction between polymorphisms in DNA  repair genes and hair dye use with 
NHL in a population-ba sed case- control study in Connecticut.
50  The study population from which the subjects were 
drawn was the same as that of Zhang et al. (2009)49 study summarized above, including 461 cases and 535 control subjects  
identified from the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center’s RCASR.  The subjects included 518 NHL cases and 597 
age-matched controls.   All subjects were genotyped for 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 DNA 
repair -enzyme gene  polymorhisms .  The hair dye e xposure assessment  was ++++ on the Rollison et al. (2006) scale.   All 
of the models were adjusted for age, race, and smoking status.   The risk of FL, but not DLBCL, was 
statistically -significantly elevated in  women with any one  of 10 of the 24 SNPs and who used hair dye before 1980,  
compared to  those who never used hair dyes; the ORs ranged from 1.93 (95% CI 1.00- 3.72; 15 cases and 70 control 
subjects with EECC1rs3212961 CC ) to 3.28 (95% CI 1.27- 8.50; 7 cases and 110 control subjects with BRCA2rs144848 
AC+CC).   In addition, there was a statistically -significant interaction between hair dye use before 1980 and  NHL  in 
women with one of these 10  SNPs (1.88 (95% CI 1.26- 2.80; 146 cases and 100 control subjects with W RNrs1346044 TT).  
There was no association between NHL, FL, or DLBCL in women who began using hair dyes after  1980.

Bladder Cancer  
Populati on-based case -control study in t he 
Netherlands .  Cases diagnosed between 1975 
and 2009 for a total of 246 female cases with 
2587 female controls; Analyses were not 
performed for the men selected for the study 
because less than 5% reported ever using hair 
dyes. No association between bladder cancer and ever/never use of 
permanent hair dyes – permanent OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.65 -1.18);  
temporary OR 0.7 (95% CI 0.58 -1.02)  
No association between bladder cancer and duration of use, number of times used per year, total number of times used over a 
lifetime, dying all the hair  or only part of the hair, or dye color 
(none of the subjects repor ted use of black dye).  
No association found when patients stratified by aggressiveness of the cancer.  Ros et al (2012)
7 
Population -based case -control study in Maine, 
Vermont, and New Hampshire.  Cases 
diagnosed 2001 to 2004 for a total of 1193 cases (911 male and 282 female) with 1418 
controls (1039 male and 378 female).   
Genotyping done for NAT2, NAT1, GSTM1, 
and GSTT1 . No association between ever/never use of hair dyes and bladder 
cancer – women OR 0.7 (95% CI 0.5 -1.0); men OR 0.7 (95% C I 
0.4-1.0).   
No association between hair dye use, NAT2 phenotype or NAT1 genotype and bladder cancer risk.  
Increased risk of bladder cancer with permanent hair dye use in a 
subgroup of women with a college degree, but no dose -response 
for color, duration of use, or total lifetime uses.  NAT2 
phenotype was associated with a suggestive, but not statistically 
significa nt, increased risk when college -degree d women were 
stratified by education – this was based on 15 cases and 6 controls.  Koutros, et al. ( 2011 )8 
Population -based case -control study of bladder 
cancer in  Iran with 692 cases and 692 controls 
(identified using the Irania n cancer registry).   
 Overall (male and female)  OR for hair dye use and bladder cancer 
was 1.99 (95% CI 1.02 -3.82).  
When women and men were analyzed separately, no  significant 
association with hair dye use and bladder cancer was reported.  Shakhssalim et al. (2010)9 
Prostate Cancer  
Hospital- based case -control study of bladder 
cancer in Taiwan with 296 cases and 296 
controls  
Another 608 incident prostate cancer cases 
were investigated to determine the rate of 
prostate cancer survival. The prevalence of hair dye use was higher in the cases than the 
controls (95/296 = 32.1% vs. 64/296 = 21.6%, p < 0.05), and the 
hair dye users had increased odds of prostate cancer when 
compared with the non -users (adjusted OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.32–
3.57).  Personal hair dye use  increased risk of prostate cancer 
with a dose -response effect.  
Of the 608 cases, 26.4% (16 1/608) reported having used hair dyes.  
The use of hair dye did not affect cumulative incidence estimates 
of prostate cancer -specific deaths (p=0.753) . Tai et al. (2016)10  
Lymphoma and Leukemia  
Cohort or case -control study of leukemia in 
North America, Europe and Asia.  Mutivariate analysis: Based on 20 studies, ever use of any type of personal hair dye was associated with a non -statistically 
significant increased risk of leukemia, when compared to no use of hair dye ( meta -RR=1.09; 95% CI 0.97 –1.22).   A model restricted 
to case -control studies yielded a statistically significant increased 
RR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.00 –1.28), while a model including cohort 
studies yielded an R R of 1.00 (95% CI 0.85 –1.19).  When 
restricted to s tudies that adjusted for smoking history, use of any 
hair dye was not associated with leukemia ( RR= 0.99; 95% CI 
0.76–1.29).  Towle et al. (2017)

in Italy.   There were 161 cases (120 lymphoid  
and 41 myeloid ) and 84  randomly- selected 
controls  among women in the population 
studied . Multivariate analysis: Hair dye use for at least 15 years was 
associated with NHL  (OR=2.3; 95% CI 1.0- 4.9), but hair dye use 
for less than 15 years was not associated with NHL  (OR=1.4; 95%

Breast Cancer  
Population -based case -control study of breast 
cancer in African American and European 
American women in New York city and 10 
counties in New Jersey.  There were 1508 African American and 772 European American 
cases and 1290 African American and 715 
Europea n American frequency -matched (by 
age and county of residence) control subjects . Increase in the odds of breast cancer  in African American women 
who reported using dark permanent hair dyes ( 1.52; 95% CI 
1.21- 1.91), African American women who typically had t heir hair 
dyed in a salon ( 1.30; 95% CI 1.03 -1.63), and European American 
women who had a history of both hair dyes and chemical hair 
relaxers ( 2.21; 95% CI 1.26 -3.86) .  W omen who started using 
hair dyes before 1980 were not distinguished from women who 
started in 1980 or thereafter.  Llanos et al. (2017)

Population -based case -control study of breast 
cancer in Finland.  There were 6,567 cases and 21,598 age -matched controls. Increase in the odds of breast cancer in women who ever used hair dyes, compared with those who never used hair dyes (OR=1.28; 95% CI 1.10 -1.48).  Statistically significant trend in ORs for 
cumulative use of hair dyes (1.07 and 1.31 for 1- 2 episodes and 
35-89 episodes, respectively).  Heikkinen et al. (2015)

Prospective population -based cohort study of 
breast cancer in China.  Cases of breast cancer include 234 hair dye users and 358 non -users.  No increase in the relative risk of breast cancer in women who 
ever used hair dyes, compared with never used hair dyes (RR=0.93 ; 95% CI 0.78 -1.09).  Stratification by menopausal 
status indicated no association between breast cancer and hair dye 
use in either pre - or post -menopausal women.  Mendelsohn et al. ( 2009)

 11 Hospital based case- control study  in the UK.  
There were 191 cases and 561 age matched 
controls.  73 cases and 213 controls had ever 
used hair dyes.  A non -statistically significant  increase in the relative risk of breast 
cancer in women who ever used hair dyes, compared with never 
used hair dyes ( RR=1.01). There was no evidence of an increasing 
risk for breast cancer with increasing duration of use of hair dyes 
or with use beginning more than four or more than nine years before diagnosis.  
 
  Kinlen et al. (1977)
51 
Hospital based case- control study in Canada  
and London .  There were 85 cases and 170 
controls, both over two locations.  A non -statistically significant increase in the odds of breast cancer 
in women who ever used hair dyes, compared with never used ha ir 
dyes (London: RR =1.3; 95% CI, 0.6 -2.50 and Toronto, Ontario: 
RR=1.1 ; 95% CI, 0.5- 2.4).  Further statistical analyses, allowing

Hospital based case- control study in New York 
City with 398 case s and 90 randomly selected, 
age-matched controls. No increase in the odds of breast cancer in women who ever used hair dyes, compared with never used hair dyes (OR=0.8; 95% CI 
0.6-1.1).  There was also no statistically significant difference 
between those who report using hair dyes at least once and those 
who reported more than 100 uses.  Koenig et al. (1991)

Comments on the CIR Expert Panel  document " Hair Dye Epidemiology " with reference to  Breast 
Cancer  Risk

  Background  
Taking  skin cancer  aside , breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women 
worldwide.  
Established  risk factors  are family and personal history  of breast cancer, presence of specific 
mutations to certain genes, such as BRCA1 or  BRCA2, indicators  of prolonged , increased esposure 
to endogenous oestrogen s, such as early  menarche  and late  menopause , and factors affecting the 
final cell differentiation of breast tissue, including age at first birth, number of full -term 
pregnancies , and duration of breastfeeding, all inversely  correlated with breast cancer risk. Other 
recognised  and modifiable   risk factors, such as alcohol consumption, smoking, low phy sical 
activity, obesity, oral contraceptive exposure, hormone replacement therapy , ionizing radiation, 
and night shift working,  increase the risk of breast cancer only marginally. However, since  these 
factors are largely prevalent in the population , their population- attributable risk may be  far from 
negligible  [1].  
Data linking breast cancer with exposure  to chemicals, consumer products, or pollutants are 
limited  and mostly inconclusive. In principle, chemicals may act through endocrine activity (e.g., 
bisphenol A , certain dioxin -like compounds), genotoxicity (e.g.,  heterocyclic amines ) or even 
epigenetic influences .  Noteworthy , the effect could be highly sensitive to the timing of the 
exposures  [2,3].  
  Analysis of the studies presented in the CIR Expert Panel document on hair dye and breast 
cancer  
The document of the Expert Panel presents data from seven papers  dealing with hair dye exp osure 
and breast cancer, including  5 case -control studies  [4-8], one cohort study  [9], and one systematic 
review  [10]. Three of the case -control studies were also  evaluated  in the systematic review and 
will not be specifically considered in my assessment  [4-6].  
 
The systematic review summarises results of studies conducte d from 1966 up to January 2005,  
and includes  12 case -control studies, which involved  a total of 5019 cases and 8486 controls, and 
two cohort studies which recruited a total of 1135 incident cases of breast cancer  [10]. Both fixed - 
and random -effect summary estimates were calculated, the latter being the  preferable measure in 
the presence of significant heterogeneity as is the case of  the studies conside red in the systematic 
review . The pooled relative risk (RR) was close to 1 and nonsignificant when comparing ever use vs 
never use of hair dyes. When considering intensive exposure, however, defined as more than 200 lifetime exposures, the random effect es timate of RR , while not significant, raised to 1.33 (95% 
confidence interval, CI 0.69 -2.56).  No significant increased risk was documented when restricting 
analyses to the use of permanent dyes only. Different variables were considered for adjustment in different studies, mostly including  age, smoking, and gynecological history. It should be noted

that, giving the largely prevalent use of hair dyes in the population, frequency of use rather than simple  distinction between users and nonusers , would be relevant to consider .  
 
After the above mentioned systematic review was published, data from three addition al studies 
were made available, all being discussed in the CIR Expert Panel document.  In a cohort s tudy 
conducted in the framework of the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a total of 75221 women completed a baseline survey between 1996 and 2000 and were followed up to December 2005  [9]. 
A total of 358 incident cases of breast cancer were identified. In the  sample, 29076 women 
(39.6%) reported ever using hair dye. The RR for breast cancer in hair dye users vs nonusers, 
adjusted by  age, education and smoking, was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.78 -1.09). No relation was 
documented between duration of hair dye use and risk of cancer. These data are reassuring. 
However, limited questions were as ked about hair dye use, with no  information on  the type of 
hair dye used (permanent vs semipermanent) nor about the frequency of use. Moreover, exposure was assessed over the 3 years preceding  the baseline interview  only . Hence women 
exposed in the past, but not over the last 3 years, were classified as nonusers, a potential 
misclassification which , in the presence of an association,  may tend to minimize it  regardless of 
whether the association is positive or negative ( i.e., bias toward the null).   
 In a case -control study  conducted in the metropolitan New York City area and in ten counties in 
New Jersey (NJ), involving both African Americans and White women, breast cancer cases were identified by multiple sources , including hospital charts and NJ cancer registry  [7]. Community 
controls were selected matched on age and race with cases.  A total of 2,280 cases and 2,005 
controls were enrolled. The use of hair products, including hair dyes, chemical relaxers/straighteners, and conditioning creams was assessed by a questionnaire. Data on hair dyes included the age of starting use, the typic al annual frequency of use, the typical shade 
adopted, the typical application modality (e.g., home -kit vs salon), total duration in years of use. 
Potential confounders were selected based on a p- value criterion (p<0.10). Final odds ratio(OR) 
estimates were adjusted by age, education, body mass index, family history of breast cancer, and oral contraceptive use. In the control group , about 30% of African Americans and 58% of Whites 
reported regular use of hair dyes. Overall, ever use of hair dyes and duratio n of use were  not 
significantly associated with  increased cancer risk in both African Americans and Whites. Among 
African Americans, an  increased risk of breast cancer was docu mented for the use of dark hair dye 
shades , and for salon application of dyes , adjusted OR being 1.51 (95%  CI, 1.20 -1.9) and 1.26 (95%  
CI, 1.00 -1.58), respectively . In Whites, an increased risk was documented for dua l use of relaxers 
and hair dyes with OR 2.40 (95%  CI 1.35 -4.27), the wide confidence interval reflecting the limited 
num ber of exposed women. When considering  the estrogen receptor status  of cancer , the risk of 
estrogen positive breast cancer was incresased in African Americans with a higher frequency of  
hair dye use  (OR 1.36, 95% CI, 1.01- 1.84 ) and in Whites with the  use of dark hair dye shades (OR 
1.54, 95% CI, 1.01- 2.33). These differences in risk profile between African Americans and Whites 
are not easy to reconcile . They  may re flect different patterns of use . They may also  represent 
chance effects due to multiple testing. R eplication of results by an independent study  is needed . 
Ideally, such a study should be able to ascertain the type of hair dye product used and its timing of use. 
 
A population based case -control study in Finland recruited a total of 6,567 breas t cancer patients  
diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 and 21,598 age -matched controls.  The recruitment of patients 
was based on  a nation -wide cancer registry covering almost 100% of solid tumors  [8].

The exposure of primary interest was the use of hair dyes wi th detailed information on the 
cumulative lifetime number of hair dye episodes, age at first use, and the types of dyes used, 
classified as temporary, semi- permanent, permanent, " bleach,"  and partial. When calculating ORs, 
potential confounding factors, namely  parity, age at first birth, family history of breast cancer, 
menarche age, use of hormonal contraceptives, physical activity,  alcohol use, BMI and education, 
were included in a stepwise regression model.  Bias-adjusted ORs were calculated as well. A large 
proportion of women reported ever use of hair dye products, with rates increasing from 84% in 
women born before 1950 up to 92%  in women born in or after 1960. The odds of breast cancer 
was significantly increased when comparing ever vs  never users of  hair dyes  (OR 1.23, 95% CI: 
1.11– 1.36).  The OR increased significantly with the increase in number of reported hair dye 
episodes, from  1.07 with 1 –2 dye episodes up to 1.31 for 35 –89 dye episodes. Early age at first dye  
(20–29 years) was associated with h igher odds of breast cancer when compared to late age at first 
dye (40 years or later) (OR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05– 1.25). When considering ever use vs no use, the ORs 
were increased with all the different types of hair dyes, t he highest estimates being  obtained  for 
women who reported to have used temporary and/or semi -permanent dyes, ORs being  1.32 ( 95% 
CI: 1.16 –1.52) and 1.31  (95% CI: 1.17– 1.46), respectively. Latency of effect was suggested by the 
fact that the OR for cumulative hair dye use was the highest among women born between 1950 
and 1959.  
 Strengths of the epidemiologic studies  include evaluation of a variety of populations, including 
those with exposure to dark hair colors. Limitations of some of the studies are  lack of specificity 
for type of hair dyes used (oxidative versus non- oxidative) and details on color, type, or duration 
of use. In addition, formulations have changed over time, and they differ based on the region of the world in which they are produced and sold. Hence the specific product use d and the timing of 
use should be better considered.  
  Concise summary statements  
The available evidence linking hair dye use and breast cancer is limited, but warrants further investigations.  
Based on the available human evidence, personal use of hair dyes is unlikely to be an important 
risk factor for breast cancer.  However,  of particular concern, are two recent studies pointing to an 
increased risk in  different ethnic groups and populations, African Americans, White  American 
women, Finnish women.  
As a  short term action, I would suggest to conduct a systematic review incorporating the evidence 
from the most recent studies.
