PREFACE
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 emphasizes the need for standards to p ro tect the h ealth  and safety  of workers exposed to an ever- increasing number of p o te n tia l hazards in  th e ir workplace. Consequently, the N ational I n s titu te  fo r Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has implemented a program to evaluate the adverse h ealth  e ffe c ts  of widely used chemical and physical agents. This program includes the development of Special Hazard Reviews th a t serve to support and complement the other major h ealth  assessment a c tiv itie s  of the I n s titu te .
The in te n t of a Special Hazard Review is  to analyze and document, from a h ealth  standpoint, the problems associated w ith a given in d u s tria l chemical, process, or physical agent. G enerally, a Special Hazard Review is  concerned w ith those hazards of a chronic nature such as cancer, m utagenicity, te ra to g e n ic ity , or e ffe c ts  on reproduction. However, they may also deal with other e ffe c ts  th a t have been id e n tifie d  as being harmful to workers when these e ffe c ts  re s u lt from exposure to substances found in the workplace. Special Hazard Reviews also recommend control measures, work p ra c tic e s, or other appropriate actio n  to a s s is t employers in p ro tectin g  the h ealth  and w ell-being of w orkers.

SYNOPSIS
This Special Hazard Review evaluates av ailab le inform ation concerning the carcinogenicity and metabolism of benzidine-based dyes and concludes th a t a l l  these dyes should be recognized as p o te n tia l human carcinogens.
This conclusion is  based on evidence th a t four of the dyes have rap idly induced tumors in animals; th a t two stu d ies of dye workers demonstrate an asso ciatio n  between benzidine-based dye exposure and bladder cancer in workers; th a t a l l  of the benzidine-based dyes thus fa r teste d  have been metabolized in animals to the carcinogen, benzidine; and th a t the enzyme (azoreductase) which breaks down these dyes to benzidine is found in both animals and humans. This enzyme acts upon a m ultitude of azo compounds to chemically reduce and break the azo linkage and, th e re fo re , i t  is  highly probable th a t the azo-linkage in the as yet untested benzidine-based dyes is  also cleaved forming benzidine. In ad d itio n , two carcinogenic im p urities, 4-aminobiphenyl (an O S H A  regulated carcinogen) and 2,4- diaminoazobenzene (an animal carcinogen) have been id e n tifie d  in one commercial sampling of a benzidine-based dye and may con tribu te to the carcinogenic p o te n tia l of these dyes.
Dyes c o n stitu te  a large and d iv erse group of chemicals th a t have many a p p licatio n s for im parting color to d iverse products. More than 1,200 chemically unique and s tru c tu ra lly  d iffe re n t dyes are manufactured in the United S ta te s, and an ad d itio n al 800 are imported. Dyes are c la s s ifie d  according to th e ir chemical stru c tu re  as w ell as by the method of ap p licatio n  in the dyeing process.
A  major c lass of dyes are those derived from benzidine, an aromatic amine acknowledged by both industry and government as causing bladder cancer in humans.
These recommendations include those dyes containing an unsubstituted benzidine stru c tu re  in  th e ir makeup. Such dyes are larg ely  c la s s ifie d  as d ire c t dyes, since they may be applied d ire c tly  to fab rics or other su b strates without pretreatm ent or subsequent processing.
Of some 200 benzidine-based dyes, about 30 are now marketed in the United S ta tes. The most recent estim ate of employee exposure is about 79,000 workers in 63 occupations. Market trends show a decreased usage from over 7  m illio n  pounds in  1976 to about 3.3 m illio n  pounds in 1978. All but one U S company has phased out the manufacture of these dyes, but imports have increased to 1.6 m illio n  pounds in  1978 in d icatin g  continued worker exposure. Benzidine-based dyes are used prim arily to color te x tile s , le a th e r, and paper. However, d iverse in d u strie s consume 20%  of the to ta l.

I . IN TR O D U C TIO N
Dyes c o n stitu te  a large and diverse group of chemicals th at have diverse app licatio ns fo r im parting color to many types of products. They may be broadly defined as w ater-soluble chemical substances th at contain chromophoric stru c tu re s and thus may be used to color another substance by becoming attached to i t  by m olecular bonding, adsorption, absorption, or mechanical adherence.
Pigments, in co n trast to dyes, are inso lub le and impart th e ir color to another substance by being p hy sically  attached to or incorporated in to  i t .  D etailed inform ation on dyes and pigments may be found in the Colour Index [1], a compendium of tech n ical inform ation on dyes and th e ir use.
The use of dyes dates as fa r back as p re h isto ric  man, but the sy nth etic dye industry began in 1856 when William H. Perkin f i r s t  synthesized the dye mauve [2]. Since th a t tim e, the sy nth etic dye industry has grown extensively in the United S tates as w ell as in other cou n tries.
More than 1,200 chemically unique and s tru c tu ra lly  d iffe re n t dyes are manufactured in the United S ta tes, and an ad d itio n al 800 dyes are imported[3]. Dyes are c la s s ifie d  according to th e ir chemical s tru c tu re  as w ell as by the method of ap p licatio n  in the dyeing process. The dyes evaluated in th is  review are those containing the benzidine moiety without any s u b s titu tio n  on the diphenyl portion of the molecule, ie , those having a para diamino diphenyl grouping in th e ir s tru c tu ra l configuration . They are h erea fte r referred  to as benzidine-based dyes. Benzidine-based dyes are larg ely  c la s s ifie d  as d ire c t dyes, since they may be applied d ire c tly  to fa b rics or other su b strate s w ithout pretreatm ent or w ithout subsequent processes th a t firm ly attach  the dye to the su b strate  (mordanting) [2]. More than 200 benzidine-based dyes are lis te d  in the Colour Index or are used commercially (see Appendix I I ) . Over 30 benzidine-based dyes have commercial importance in  the United S ta tes, according to the U S In tern a tio n al Trade Commission [3]. Seventeen are manufactured in th is  country, a l l  by a sin g le company; the remaining dyes are a l l  imported (see Appendix I I I ) .  Benzidine-based dyes are used c h ie fly  in the le a th e r, te x tile , and paper in d u strie s [1 ,3 ,4 ], but they are also used by b eau tician s, c ra ft workers, and the general public [5].
The common s ta rtin g  m aterial fo r the manufacture of these dyes, benzidine, is  acknowledged by both industry [6] and government (Federal R egister 39(20):3756-97, January 29, 1974) to cause bladder cancer. This is  based on considerable evidence from stu d ies with humans as w ell as with animals. The carcin og enicity of benzidine was reviewed by Clayson [7] and by Haley [8]. The evidence presented in those reviews dem onstrates that both b rie f and prolonged exposures to benzidine have been associated with 
the development of bladder cancer in workers [9].

Aromatic amines, as a c lass of chem icals, are generally carcinogenic. Benzidine is  an outstanding carcinogen w ithin th is  c la ss; i t  causes cancer in humans, r a t s , ham sters, and mice [9-22]. The s tru c tu re -a c tiv ity  re latio n sh ip  between aromatic amines and carcinogenic potency has been reviewed in d e ta il [12,23,24]. In ad d itio n , benzidine has also been used as a reference mutagen (a known p o sitiv e  control) for several years by the Huntingdon Research Center [25]. In lig h t of a l l  the extensive evidence in both humans and experim ental anim als, NIOSH recommended in  1973 th at benzidine be regulated as a carcinogen; in  1974, the Occupational Safety and Health A dm inistration of the Department of Labor promulgated a reg ulato ry standard fo r benzidine.
U n til recen tly  there had been l i t t l e  concern regarding the dyes derived from and which contain benzidine as an in te g ra l portion  of th e ir chemical stru c tu re . Benzidine chemically united to other substances was not considered dangerous; in  1959, B illiard-D uchesne [26] sta te d  there was "no danger in using the finish ed  dyes." Only recently  has there been serious consideration given to the lik elih oo d  th a t processes in the body could free the benzidine th a t was o rig in a lly  used in  the manufacture of the dyes [27]. The process of m etabolizing or converting a substance back to a s ta rtin g  component or to another compound i s  commonly refe rre d  to as biotransform ation.
In A pril 1978, NIOSH [28] and the N ational Cancer I n s titu te  (NCI) jo in tly  recommended th a t three widely used benzidine-based dyes (D irect Black 38, D irect Blue 6, and D irect Brown 95) be handled as i f  they were carcinogens. The NIOSH/NCI recommendation was based on two major fin din gs. F ir s t, NCI had determined in  a short-term  animal feeding study th a t ra ts  adm inistered the above dyes developed a high incidence of hepatocarcinomas and n eo p lastic nodules in  5-13 weeks. N o sim ilar lesio n s developed in control animals [29]. Second, NIOSH fie ld  stu d ies demonstrated th a t some workers who had been exposed to these dyes had benzidine in th e ir urine [27]. The amount found in  the urine was g reater than could be expected from benzidine contam ination in  the dyes. This demonstrated th a t the dye i t s e l f  had broken down, releasin g  benzidine.
Since th a t tim e, NIOSH has examined and evaluated the availab le lite r a tu r e  concerning these and re la te d  dyes. This Special Hazard Review appraises the carcinogenic p o te n tia l of those dyes known to contain the u nsub stituted  benzidine moiety.

II. CHARACTERISTICS OF BENZIDINE-BASED DYES
Chemical and P hysical C h a rac teristic s
At room tem perature, benzidine-based dyes are a l l  colored so lid s with n eg lig ib le  vapor pressure. The sp e cific  water s o lu b ility  v aries from dye to dye, but a ll are s u ffic ie n tly  w ater-soluble to be used for dyeing in an aqueous solu tio n . They are a l l  re la tiv e ly  sta b le  in a ir  or so lution  at ambient tem peratures, and possess considerable fastn ess to lig h t. Unlike some of the anthraquinone vat dyes, benzidine-based dyes do not accelerate the tendering of c e llu lo s ic  type fa b rics under the influence of lig h t [30]. They exhaust onto (combine with) c e llu lo s ic  fib e rs from a s a lt bath without other treatm ent. Based on th is  property, these dyes are called  substantive[4]. They usually contain two or three azo groups.
D irect dyes give excellen t coverage and generally do not otherwise a lte r  the appearance or character of the m aterial to be colored. They cover a wide hue range [1,4] . Many d ire c t dyes now on the market do not contain the benzidine moiety and, th e re fo re , are not considered in th is  review. These nonbenzidine-derived d ire c t dyes provide industry with a wide range of colors and hues which may be considered for use as su b s titu te s for benzidine-based dyes [1,30-32],
The chemical stru c tu re s of benzidine-based dyes cu rren tly  of commerical importance are shown in Appendix I I I ;  a l l  have the c h a ra c te ris tic  diazotized benzidine nucleus as shown in Figure I I - l  and d if fe r only in the su b stitu e n ts attached a t e ith e r diazo linkage, ie , -N=N-. This linkage is considered the most la b ile  portion of each of these dyes, and, in each case, enzymatic [29,33-35] or thermal breakdown [2,36] re s u lts  in the production of benzidine.

Purity and Stability
Benzidine and other carcinogenic substances such as 4-amino biphenyl and 2 ,4-diaminoazobenzene may be present in benzidine-based dyes both as the re s u lt of im p urities introduced in  manufacturing processes or may be present in benzidine-based dyes as products of thermal or enzymatic decomposition. NIOSH has measured the amount of benzidine present in d ire c t dyes from imported and domestic sources [27]. For 26 samples of 11 types of dyes imported from seven co u n tries, the benzidine concentration ranged from less than 1  ppm to 224 ppm. Only six  samples contained g reater than 10 ppm of benzidine. Sim ilar re s u lts  were found for 26 samples from domestic sources. No sin g le type of dye accounted for the high re s u lts . Few in v e stig a to rs have attempted to analyze im purities other than benzidine present in d ire c t dyes. However, in one commercially produced lo t of D irect Black 38 (a benzidine-based d y e), 150 ppm of 4-amino biphenyl and 9,200 ppm of 2 ,4-diaminoazobenzene (Basic Orange 2) were found even though only 0.1 ppm of benzidine was detected [37].
The concentration of im p urities such as benzidine can be increased by decomposition of dyes containing benzidine as a portion of the stru c tu re . A  measurable increase in  the concentration of benzidine and 4-amino biphenyl im purities was found when D irect Black 38 in aqueous solu tio n  was stored a t 25 or 37.5 C  fo r 48 hours [37]. In hamster u rine stored at room tem perature, su b s ta n tia l increases in the concentrations of benzidine, 4- amino biphenyl, and 2 ,4-diaminoazobenzene were found 48 and 96 hours a fte r the add itio n of D irect Black 38 to the u rine; at 5 C  the dye in hamsteru rin e was sta b le  at le a s t 96 hours [37].
Although a l l  decomposition products have not been id e n tifie d , benzidine-based dyes have been shown to break down in aqueous solu tio n  at elevated tem peratures [36]. M el'nikov and K irillo v a  [36] examined a number of tech nical grade d ire c t dyes, including some th a t were benzidine-based. They found th at the ra te  of decomposition of the dyes was accelerated  by increased tem perature and g re atly  accelerated in the presence of iro n . For example, at 140 C  a f te r  6 hours, 17.3% of Congo Red (D irect Red 28) decomposed, and, under the same conditions in  the presence of iro n , 83/i decomposed. When a 0.1% aqueous so lu tio n  of Congo Red (D irect Red 28) wasstored a t 100 C  for 1  hour, no decomposition was observed. The presence ofte x tile  add itiv es such as urea, trieth an o lam in e, and cellosolv e also 
increased the ra te  of decomposition.

III. CHARACTERISTICS OF EXPOSURE
Manufacture and Uses
The synthesis of dyes is  b rie f ly  described in the Colour Index [1]. Generally, the diazotized benzidine is  reacted (coupled) with su ita b le  secondary components such as hydroxylated arom atics or aromatic amines [1 ,2 ,4 ]. Since the manufacture of dyes is  d irected  toward producing a p a rtic u la r color and not to producing a sp e cific  chemical e n tity , im purities such as benzidine, 4-amino biphenyl, 2 ,4-diaminoazobenzene, diphenyline, and semidine find th e ir way in to  the fin a l dye product. If these substances do not in te rfe re  with the dyeing process, o rd in a rily  they are not removed [4,38]. A dditional substances, including other dyes, may be required to produce the p a rtic u la r shade or hue desired in a product. Thus, dyes in general represent m ixtures of substances ra th e r than a p a rtic u la r chemical e n tity  [4,38-40]. This is  fu rth er complicated by the fa c t th a t manufacturers may use d iffe rin g  conditions of sy n th esis, s ta rtin g  m aterials of d iffe re n t p u rity , and even d iffe re n t methods to manufacture dyes [30,39,41]. These fa c ts are important since each dye is  depicted as a d e fin itiv e  chemical s tru c tu re  in  textbooks [2] and in  the Colour Index [1].
More than 30 m anufacturers in the United S tates now produce various d ire c t dyes. Only one of the nine U S m anufacturers th at produced benzidine-based dyes in 1974 s t i l l  does so in 1979 [3,40,42]. Some d is trib u to rs  import the benzidine-based dyes for re sa le  in the United S tates [27] . The 1979 Buyer's Guide published by the American A ssociation of T extile Chemists and C o lo rists (A A TC C ) l i s t s  20 u nsu b stitu ted  benzidine- based dyes fo r sa le  in the United S tates [43]. Not a l l  dyes sold in the United S tates, however, are lis te d  in  the Buyer's Guide (W  M artin, verbal communication, July 1979).
Since 1974, the eight U S m anufacturers th a t phased out the synthesis of benzidine-based dyes [3] have replaced them with phthalocyanine, o- to lid in e , o -d ia n isid in e , phenylenediamine, and dioxyazine-type dyes [40]. Nonbenzidine-based s u b s titu te s  appear to be in demand; fiv e m anufacturers now s e ll nonbenzidine-based su b s titu te s  for D irect Black 38 [30,40,43]. A  su ita b le  s u b s titu te  fo r D irect Blue 6 in  the lea th e r dyeing industry has been d if f ic u l t to find [40]. NIOSH considers the need for appropriate toxicologic te s tin g  of a l l  dye s u b s titu te s  to be e s s e n tia l before they are used in the workplace.
Benzidine-based dyes are used extensively to color te x t il e s , le a th e r, and paper. Ease of ap p licatio n  has been a major a sse t to th e ir general a v a ila b ility  and widespread usage. Of the to ta l use, 40%  is  used to color paper, 25%  to color t e x tile s , 15%  fo r le a th e r, and 20%  for diverse app licatio n s in the petroleum, rubber, p la s tic s , wood, soap, fu r, and h air dye in d u strie s [1,3,28,32].

Extent of Occupational Exposure
Based on a n atio n al survey conducted from 1972 to 1974 [44], NIOSH estim ated th a t approximately 79,200 workers in 63 occupations were p o te n tia lly  exposed to benzidine-based dyes. These p o te n tia l exposures occurred in the dye m anufacturing, te x tile  dyeing, p rin tin g , paper, and leath er in d u s trie s . Appendix I I I  l i s t s  the estim ated worker exposure for

each commercially av ailab le benzidine-based dye. Dye use in a rts  and c ra fts  was not included. An estim ate of worker exposure to benzidine was given by Ferber et a l in  1976 [45]. However, no estim ate was made of worker exposure to the dyes derived from benzidine.
NIOSH has contacted the one U S manufacturer of benzidine-based dyes as w ell as four previous U S m anufacturers. While U S production has decreased from a high of 2,919 M g (6,436,000 lbs) in 1976 to 777 M g  (1,712,251 lbs) in 1978, imports have increased from 272 M g  (600,000 lbs) in  1976 to 726 M g  (1,600,000 lbs) in  1978. The present actu al worker exposure to benzidine- based dyes cannot be ascertained p re cise ly , but appears su b sta n tia l in lig h t of the continuing production, s a le , and use of these dyes [30,41,43,46] .

IV. BIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF BENZIDINE-BASED DYES
Human Cancer Studies
Tw o epidem iological stud ies have reported th at exposure to benzidine- based dyes produces cancer in  humans [47-49]. Yoshida et al [47,49] examined the p o s s ib ility  of a re latio n sh ip  between employment in the dyeing industry and an increased ris k  of developing bladder cancer. Occupational h is to rie s  were av ailab le for 200 male p a tie n ts , a ll  of whom had bladder cancer and who resided in  Kyoto, Japan. One control group consisted of 148 men, at le a s t 45 years old, who had been adm itted to h o sp ita ls in the area with urinary d iso rders other than malignant tumors. Of the 200, 17 hadworked in  the dyeing ind u stry . Bladder cancer p a tie n ts were 6.8 times more lik e ly  to have been employed as dyers than p a tie n ts with other urinary d iso rd ers. Ten of the 17 had been Kimono p a in te rs . In a subsequent survey of Kimono p ain ters in the Kyoto area, Yoshida and Miyakawa [47] found th a t the p ra ctic e  of w etting the brush or spatula on the tongue was common. Of 141 persons interview ed, 47%  admitted to th is  p ra c tic e . This indicated th a t ing estio n  of benzidine-based dyes was lik e ly . N o inform ation on sp e cific  dyes to which the bladder cancer p a tie n ts were exposed was a v a ilab le. However, Yoshida and Miyakawa re fe rre d  to four benzidine-based dyes, D irect Black 38, D irect Green 1, D irect Red 17, and D irect Red 28, th a t had widespread use in  Japan in  the early  1970's [47].
Genin [48] also studied worker exposure to benzidine-based dyes. A fter prelim inary work in which benzidine or d ia n isid in e  had been found in the u rine of r a ts  given dyes based on these substances, Genin examined the u rine of 22 workers engaged in the drying and grinding of d ire c t azo dyes [48]. Benzidine was present in the urine of eight persons and d ian isid in e was present in th ree. The q u a n titie s varied from what were described as trace amounts to 0.3 jig/ml. Although the dyes being worked with at the time of urine sample c o llec tio n  were not described, Genin referred  to two benzidine— based dyes, D irect Black 38 and D irect Blue 2, as being of g re a te st commercial importance in the USSR. Genin then examined the company records and found fiv e cases of bladder tumors. Three had occurred between 1965 and 1968 among workers engaged in drying and grinding of d ire c t azo dyes. The persons were 68, 70, and 72 years old; had la te n t periods of 18, 33, and 43 years; and had been exposed 24, 3, and 18 y ears, re sp ectiv ely . Genin concluded th a t exposure to d ire c t azo dyes, synthesized from diphenyl amino d e riv a tiv e s, is  p o te n tia lly  a cancer hazard. A  dose-response re la tio n sh ip  could not be estab lish ed , since the in te n s ity  of exposure to the dyes was not measured.

The N ational Cancer I n s titu te  (NCI) conducted a 93-day study with mice 
and r a ts  th a t were fed three commercially av ailab le benzidine-based dyesi 
D irect Black 38, D irect Blue 6, and D irect Brown 95 [29]. The three dyes
8
were tech nical grade, fa c to ry -stren g th  d ire c t dyes. The molecular stru c tu re s are shown in Appendix I I I ,  and the benzidine moiety can be id e n tifie d  in each s tru c tu re . D irect Blue 6 was 66%  pure, D irect Black 38 was 86%  pure, and D irect Brown 95 was 79%  pure, according to the m anufacturer. Midwest Research I n s titu te  confirmed sim ilar values upon rean aly sis of the m a teria ls. The balance of the c o n stitu en ts was mostly s a lt and w ater, but analyses by th in -la y e r chromatography (TLC), which used two d iffe re n t solvent systems, demonstrated the presence of 8-15 minor im purities in each dye. N o attem pt was made to id e n tify  or q u a n titate  these ind ividual im p u rities. A  sp e c ific  analy sis by high-pressure liq u id  chromatography was done to determine the presence or absence of benzidine. N o benzidine was detected a t the lowest d etectab le lim it of 0.004% (40 ppm) in any of the dyes. Corn o il was added to the dyes at 1.3% to suppress dust form ation. While no sp e c ific  analyses were done for benzidine in the food, spectrophotom etric analyses of e x tra c ts of the d ie t showed th a t eachof the dyes was sta b le  in  feed fo r up to 2 weeks a t tem peratures up to 45C.
For the bioassay in Fischer 344 r a t s , each dye was fed to 10 male and 10 female r a ts  at 190, 375, 750, 1,500 or 3,000 ppm [29]. Each dye was fed to 10 B6C3F1 mice of each sex a t 750, 1,500, 3,000, 6,000, or 12,500 ppm, except th a t females were given D irect Brown 95 only up to 6,000 ppm. Ten matched mice and ra ts  of each sex served as co n tro ls at each dose le v e l. A ll animals except co n tro ls received one of the three dyes in th e ir feed fo r approximately 13 weeks.
The f i r s t  observed tumor in the r a ts  given dye occurred before 5 weeksin each case, reg ardless of the type of dye fed [29]. This tim e-to-tum orin te rv a l is  the sh o rte st encountered in the NCI bioassay program thus fa r. Dibromoethane has the next sh o rte st tim e-to-tum or in te rv a l, which was 10 weeks [50]. The sh o rte st tim e-to-tum or for benzidine i t s e l f  th a t has been observed in adult r a ts  is  6 months [7 ,8 ,1 3 ]. Tumor incidences in the ra ts  given 1,500 ppm of a benzidine-based dye in the food are shown in  Table IV- 
1.
The sing le most important aspect of th is  study [29] was th at sig n ific a n t numbers of cancerous and precancerous lesio n s developed in the ra ts  w ithin 93 days; hepatocarcinomas and/or n eo p lastic nodules developed in a sig n ific a n t number of r a ts , except in  the males exposed to D irect Brown 95. With th is  dye the lesio n s found in male r a ts  were lim ited to those described in the NCI rep o rt as precancerous. N either cancerous nor precancerous lesion s occurred in any of the control anim als, nor had such lesio n s ever been observed in any of the contro ls in previous studies w ithin a 93-day time period.
The in v e stig a to rs [29] concluded th a t the cancer observed was caused by the dyes themselves or a m etabolite and was not due to benzidine as an im purity. Since the benzidine concentration in each dye was le s s than 40 ppm, and since the tim e-to-tum or in te rv a l fo r benzidine in r a ts  at even 
higher lev els has always been much longer than th a t observed for the dyes 
[7,8,10,13-15,18-21], th is  conclusion appears to be ju s t i f i e d . The
9
possible ro le of other im purities in the demonstrated carcin ogenicity of the dyes cannot be estab lished  from the inform ation contained in the re p o r t.

The Clearinghouse on Environmental Carcinogens, a group representing ind u stry, government, and the public, makes fin a l evaluation of the experimental re s u lts  on substances tested  by the NCI bioassay program. The group concluded th a t D irect Blue 6 and D irect Black 38 dyes caused cancer in both sexes of Fischer 344 ra ts  under the conditions of th is  bioassay procedure, and th a t D irect Brown 95 dye caused cancer only in female ra ts  [29]. The Clearinghouse on Environmental Carcinogens concluded th at te s tin g  at lower lev e ls for longer durations was unnecessary because of the rapid appearance of the tumors. The premature term ination of the study, o rig in a lly  contracted to be carried  out over the normal life tim e s of the ra ts  and mice and a t nontoxic le v e ls , precluded dem onstration of any carcinogenic e ffe c t in the mouse or a dose-response re la tio n sh ip  in  the 
r a t.
In co n trast to the NCI study, two other in v estig a tio n s of the 
carcinogenic p ro p erties of benzidine-based dyes have given equivocal re s u lts . In a 270-day study by F u jita  et al [51], D irect Blue 6 was
10
in jected  subcutaneously into  20 male and 20 female r a ts  of an unspecified s tra in . Total doses were 170 and 180 mg, re sp e ctiv e ly , given a t weekly or biweekly in te rv a ls . The d aily  dose was 1  ml of an aqueous 1 %  so lu tio n  of the dye. Total su rvival a t 270 days was 50%. In 2 of the 20 females, in je c tio n  s ite  sarcomas developed a t 211 and 216 days, re sp e ctiv e ly . While atrophy of the parenchymal c e lls  of the liv e r and d ila ta tio n  of the liv e r sinusoids were found during pathological examination of. the r a t s , no pre­n eo p lastic or n eo p lastic lesion s were reported. This study did not support the NCI findings of a rapid n eo p lastic response. The appearance of local sarcomas at in je c tio n  s ite s  may or may not in d icate carcinog enicity  in th is study since no tumors were observed a t remote s ite s  [23].
N iitsu  [33] studied the carcin og enicity  of two benzidine-based dyes, D irect Blue 6 and D irect Black 38 (sources u n sp e c ifie d ). W istar ra ts  were given the dyes v ia th e ir drinking water (0.04%). Twenty male and twenty- fiv e female ra ts  were used to te s t D irect Black 38. Because D irect Blue 6 was found to be p a rtic u la rly  toxic to male r a ts , the assay of th is  dye was lim ited to 20 female r a ts . The observation period was lim ited to only 14 months, since by th a t time a large number of animals had developed in fectio n s and died. The author [33] concluded th a t the immunological competence of the ra ts  had been compromised. With D irect Black 38 adm in istratio n, 14-month su rv iv al was 4/20 for males and 2/25 for females. One of the two surviving females had cancer of the b reast (pathological designation not sp e c ifie d ). With D irect Blue 6 ad m in istratio n, 12/20 female ra ts  were a liv e  at 12 months; 1  of the 12 surviving W istar female ra ts  had a glandular tumor of the outer ear. No tumors were found in the co n tro ls. N iitsu  concluded th at the carcin og enicity  or lack of carcin ogenicity of these two d ire c t d yestuffs could not be determined from the re s u lts  of the experiment [33].
D ifferent s tra in s  of r a ts  and d iffe re n t sources of dye were used in the N iitsu  and the NCI stu d ies. Also, the NCI re s u lts  were found using concentrations of 1,500 and 3,000 ppm in the food [29], while the N iitsu study used 400 ppm in  the drinking water [33]. The marked s u s c e p tib ility  of the ra ts  to in fec tio n  noted in the N iitsu  14-month study was not found in the sh o rter 93-day NCI study, except for one ra t th at died of b a c te ria l in fec tio n . The 93-day period may have been too short a time to expect the type of in fec tio n  noted by N iitsu  [33].
M arshall [79], in 1953, reported th a t V ita l Red (a benzidine-based dye) injected  in tra p e rito n e a lly  (ip) into  27 W ister albino r a t s , aged 3-4 months, a t a dosage of 1  ml of a 2 %  aqueous so lu tio n  of the dye every 2  weeks for 7  months, produced no p athological changes. A  d eta ile d  pathology d escrip tio n  was not given in  the re p o rt. Twenty animals m aintained on the same d ie t were the negative con tro ls fo r th is  study. In c o n tra st, ra ts  injected  with Trypan Blue or Evans Blue (o-to lid in e-b ased  dyes) developed lymphomatous tumors. While th is  study cannot be considered a negative lifetim e  study, i t  is  apparent th a t ip -in je c te d  V ita l Red did n o t, under the experim ental conditions sta te d , rap id ly  produce liv e r tumors as did o ral adim in istratio n  of D irect Black 38, Brown 95, and Blue 6 in the NCI 
study.

K orosteleva et a l [52] reported a study in 1977 designed to te s t the carcinogenicity of D irect Red 10. They u tiliz e d  a to ta l of 75 white ra ts  of unspecified s tr a in  without s ta tin g  the number used as c o n tro ls. The p u rity  of D irect Red 10 was not described. The dye was adm inistered to the ra ts  a t 500 m g per r a t d aily  in  the food. Nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic e ffe c ts were evident by the 100th day of observation. More severe kidney e ffe c ts were noted a t a s t i l l  l a te r  stage. D irect Red 10, a benzidine-based dye, produced tumors in 10 of the 18 male ra ts  th a t had survived 500 days. The type of neoplasms found in the study were fourmicrocholangiomas (malignancy of mixed masses of liv e r cord c e lls  and b ile  d u c ts ), three leukemias (malignant transform ation at white bood c e l l s ) , two plasmacytomas (m ultiple myeloma, a neoplasm of plasma c e l l s ) , and one hypernephroma (kidney neoplasm w ith stru c tu re  th a t resembles c o rtic a l tis su e  a t the adrenal g la n d ).
These types of tumors, which are ra re  in r a ts , were markedly d iffe re n t from the hepatocarcinomas found in  the NCI study [29]. K orosteleva et al also designed the study to determine whether D irect Red 10 could be m etabolized to benzidine (see sectio n on Animal M etabolic S tu d ie s).
Another chronic te s t of the carcinogenicity of Deep D irect Black E X  (D irect Black 38) [28] was reported by Okajima e t a l in 1975 [53]. The dyewas adm inistered to male W istar ra ts  in  the drinking water fo r 60 weeks.At th at time a l l  were k ille d  since a s ig n ific a n t number had developed neoplasms. R esults are given in Table IV-2. This rep o rt confirmed th at D irect Black 38 is  carcinogenic in r a ts  when adm inistered at lower doses over a longer period of time than used in the NCI study [29], Because the 60-week experim ental period is  much sh o rter than the r a t 's  normal l i f e  span, a more extended experiment would be expected to re s u lt in s t i l l  more tumors. As in the NCI bioassay [29], i t  would appear as though i t  was not necessary to continue th is  experiment [53] over the life tim e  of the ra ts  since a s ig n ific a n t number of tumors has resu lte d  by 60 weeks.

Okajima et a l [53] and N iitsu  [33] both adm inistered D irect Black 38 to ra ts  in the drinking water a t sim ilar concentrations (500 and 400 ppm, re s p e c tiv e ly ). I t  is  not apparent why carcin og enicity  was estab lish ed  only in the study by Okajima e t a l [53]. Undoubtedly, the low surv ival ra te  in the N iitsu  study was a major fa c to r, since early  deaths may have precluded the development of cancer in  th is  study. The m o rta lity  ra te  in the N iitsu  study was 97%  for D irect Black 38, w hile the m o rtality  ra te  in the Okajima study was 13%  for the same dye.
Human M etabolic Studies
Humans as w ell as other mammals can change (m etabolize) the benzidine- based dyes back to benzidine [27,47,48,52,54]. The major organ in which benzidine-based dyes are metabolized to benzidine i s  the liv e r , but other organs also can do th is  to a g re ate r or le s se r degree [54,55].
Various b a c te ria  and y east normally found in the small and large in te s tin e  can also  reduce the azo bond in  benzidine-based dyes and release benzidine [55-57]. This occurs both in vivo and in v itro  [27,29,33,55],
The major enzyme capable of lysing (breaking) the azo linkage of benzidine-based dyes is  a cytochrome oxidase. This enzyme, termed azoreductase, i s  asso ciated  w ith the cytochrome P-450 microsomal fra c tio n  of the c e llu la r homogenate. The enzyme was extensively studied with re la tio n  to the azo dye p ro n to sil [56], and has been described as an "enzyme par excellance" fo r lysing the azo linkage of dyes [58]. Azoreductase is  an extremely nonspecific enzyme found in a l l  mammals tested  so fa r [55], as w ell as in  various microorganisms [57]. I t  is  not necessary th a t the substance be a dye fo r th is  enzyme to exert i t s  actio n . The only requirement is  the diazo linkage, ie , -N=N-. No exceptions have been reported [33,55]. Knowledge of th is  enzymatic c a p a b ility  in humans led to the following study [27].
In 1977, a NIOSH in v e stig a tio n  was undertaken to survey in d u s tria l hygiene p ra ctic es in  the dye industry and to examine u rin e samples from workers exposed to benzidine-based dyes [27] . The study protocol included p rio r n o tific a tio n  of the benzidine-based dye m anfacturer and team sampling of environmental lev e ls of to ta l p a r tic u la te . In most cases, i t  also included determ ination of the amount of dye present in the p a rtic u la te  and analy sis of the dye samples fo r resid u a l benzidine. In ad d itio n , determ ination of the u rinary  lev els of benzidine through, in  most cases, con trolled  dual a n a ly tic a l procedures was also  performed. These procedures were developed through the e ffo rts  of the C lin ica l and Biomedical Support Section, D ivision of Biomedical and Behavioral Science, and the Measurement Services Section, D ivision of P hysical Sciences and Engineering, NIOSH. Both procedures are described in  the rep o rt [27]. One of the procedures is  also given in Appendix I of th is  Special Hazard Review. The lowest d etectab le lim it fo r nonspecific primary aromatic amines by th is  method was 
1 ppb with the provision th a t a t le a s t 100 ml of u rine be av ailab le for an aly sis. This method required confirm ation of the nonspecific primary
13
aromatic amines as benzidine or monoacetyl benzidine by TLC. The other procedure used to confirm the s p lit  samples was electro n-cap tu re gaschromatography as developed by Nony and Bowman [59]. The lowest detectab leconcentration of benzidine in u rine stated  by these authors [59] was 1.4 ppb; for monoacetyl benzidine, i t  was 5.8 ppb.
Environmental and urinary samples were collected  at six  f a c i l i t i e s  where workers were p o te n tia lly  exposed to benzidine-based dyes. These f a c i l i t i e s  were: two benzidine-based dye m anufacturers, two te x tile  dyeing p la n ts , a lea th e r tanning p la n t, and a sp e cia lty  paper m ill [27].
In the f i r s t  dye manufacturing f a c il i t y , two of eight workers p o te n tia lly  exposed to benzidine-based dyes had monoacetyl benzidine in th e ir u rine. The concentration of primary amines was 3 ppb in one case and7  ppb in the o th er. These spot samples of urine were p o sitiv e  d espite thefa c t th a t the workers observed were using c a rtrid g e-ty p e face re sp ira to rs at the time of the sampling and th at the environment appeared to be dust fre e . This f a c i l i t y  has since discontinued the manufacture of benzidine- based dyes [27].
In the other dye manufacturing f a c il i t y , four workers were monitored for exposure to benzidine-based dyes. The average environmental exposure lev els of four of the workers were 4.3 , 5.2, 11.7, and 17.4 m g to ta l p a rtic u la te /c u  m. The corresponding urinary  concentrations of benzidine averaged 52, 11, 10, and 112 ppb, re sp e ctiv e ly . The worker having 112 ppbbenzidine in h is urine (spray dry operator) also had 590 ppb monoacetylbenzidine in the same sample. This f a c il i t y  has also taken measures since then to control dyestuff exposures and to monitor the urine of workers for benzidine [27].
Three of the above four workers had benzidine congeners other than monoacetyl and d ia c e ty l benzidine in th e ir u rin e. Tw o of these workers had o -to lid in e  in th e ir urine at 15 and 50 ppb. The th ird  had o -d ian isid in e in h is u rin e at 1  ppb. At the time of the in v e stig a tio n , these three workers were not exposed to o -to lid in e , o -d ia n isid in e , or to dyes derived from these two substances. However, p rio r exposure to any of these substancescould not be ruled out. Therefore, the source of o -to lid in e  and o-d ian isid in e in the u rine of these workers could not be e stab lish ed . Many workers, who were monitored and found to have short-term  environmental exposures as high as 92.7 m g to ta l p a rtic u la te /c u  m, did not provide urine samples to the in v e stig a to rs and thus th e ir u rine could not be evaluated for the presence of benzidine [27].
In one te x tile  dye manufacturing f a c il i t y , 7 p o te n tia lly  exposed workers were compared with 23 n o n in d u strially  exposed o ffic e  workers who were used as co n tro ls. D irect Black 38 and D irect Blue 2, both benzidine- based dyes, were being used at th is  f a c il i t y . No benzidine was detected in the urine of any co n tro l. U rinary concentrations of benzidine in the seven p o te n tia lly  exposed workers ranged from below the lim it of d etectio n  to 39 ppb; three had both benzidine and monoacetyl benzidine in the u rine (one dye tub operator and two dye-w eighers). The four other p o te n tia lly  exposed
14
workers had no benzidine or monoacetyl benzidine in the u rin e. The to ta l airborne p a rtic u la te  m aterial (measured gravim etrically) ranged from 1  to A  mg/cu m. N either the dye concentration nor the types of dye in the p a rtic u la te s  were determined.
In the other te x t il e  p la n t, 10 workers were also monitored in the same way. The dyes used were D irect Blue 6, D irect Black 38, D irect Brown 95, and D irect Red 8. A ll airborne concentrations were le s s than 2 m g to ta l p a rtic u la te /c u  m. Some exposures were equivalent to those in the f i r s t  te x tile  dye f a c il i t y . At th is  f a c i l i t y , the amount of benzidine-based dye in the p a rtic u la te  samples was measured c o lo rm e trica lly . The amount ranged from 0 to 29%  by weight in  the d iffe re n t samples. Presence of benzidine in the u rine was expected but not found [27].
Dye exposure in the lea th e r fin ish in g  f a c i l i t y  was lim ited to D irect Black 38 and D irect Brown 95. Time-weighted average (T W A ) environmental concentrations were 0.69, 5.79, and 10.65 mg/cu m  (three samples each).Each of the three workers p o te n tia lly  exposed wore NIOSH-approved h alf-fa ce  ca rtrid g e  re s p ira to rs . N o benzidine was found in the urine of the three workers [27].
In the sp e c ia lity  paper processing f a c il i t y , 23 environmental samples and 47 urine samples were analyzed. The environmental samples were a ll less than 6 mg/cu m  (range, 0.17-5.10 m g to ta l p a rtic u la te  m atter/cu m). In th is  f a c il i t y , management had recen tly  in itia te d  a program in which re s p ira to r use was s t r i c t l y  enforced. Approximately 1,667 kg (3,000 lb) of D irect Black 38 were consumed during the 3-day survey. D espite th is  heavy consumption, no u rine samples contained benzidine [27].
Time lim ita tio n s prevented extended and repeated m onitoring of the environment and the workers under a v a rie ty  of conditions [27]. The time of day for u rine c o lle c tio n , fo r example, may be c r i t i c a l ,  because exposure is most lik e ly  during work hours and a major portion of the benzidine m etabolites may have been elim inated in the urine before spot sampling the following day. This p o s s ib ility  of a cyclic type of excretion p attern  is made more apparent by work in  experim ental animals showing th at the benzidine m etabolites of D irect Black 38 were larg ely  excreted w ithin the f i r s t  16 hours a f te r  dye intake [37]. Since spot samples were taken during the w orkshift, the peak excretion phase may have been missed.
This study [27] demonstrated th a t benzidine can be found in the urine of workers who have contact only w ith the finished dyes under the present working conditions of the ind u stry. N o dye samples contained more than 25 ppm benzidine. C alculations provided in the NIOSH rep o rt demonstrated th at the amount of benzidine found in  urine of the workers was too great to have come only from benzidine im purity in the dye, and thus was a metabolic breakdown product of the dye. Even when i t  appeared th at standard p ro te c tiv e  equipment such as c a rtrid g e  re s p ira to rs  were used, the occurrence of benzidine in  the urine was not n ecessarily  prevented. One pulv erizer operator who was observed to be using a h a lf-fa c e  re s p ira to r had 52 ppb benzidine in h is u rine. However, th is  worker was only observed a
15
short time and i t  is  not known whether he used the re s p ira to r throughout the day.
Following id e n tific a tio n  of 2,4-diaminoazobenzene (at 9,200 ppm) and 4- amino biphenyl as contaminants in  D irect Black 38, the N ational Center for Technical Research (NCTR) [37] reanalyzed some of the the u rine samples from workers studied in  the above NIOSH in v e stig a tio n  [27]. Although q u a n tita tiv e  data were not given, 2,4-diaminoazobenzene was reported to be present in some u rine samples but not 4-amino biphenyl [37]. The In tern a tio n al Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has reviewed the carcinogenic e ffe c t of 2 ,4-diaminoazobenzene, and designated i t  an animal carcinogen [60]. O S H A  reg u lates 4-amino biphenyl as a carcinogen in the same manner as benzidine.
Genin [48] analyzed the u rine of 22 workers who had p o te n tia l long-term contact w ith benzidine-based dyes during the manufacture of the d ire c t azo dyes D irect Black 38, D irect Blue 2, D irect Blue 15, and D irect Blue 218. He found benzidine in  the urine of 8 of the 22 workers p o te n tia lly  exposed and d ia n isid in e  in  3. The concentrations of benzidine or d ia n isid in e  in the urine ranged from what were described as "tra c e  amounts" to 300 ppb, but the in d ivid u al lev els were not rep o rted . Although th is  study demonstrated th at workers exposed to benzidine-based or dianisid ine-based  dyes may have benzidine or d ia n isid in e  in  th e ir u rin e, q u a n titativ e  exposure could not be measured under the conditions p re se n t, and dose- response data were not reported.
Korosteleva et a l [52,61], in stud ies from 1966 to 1977, id e n tifie d  a benzidine complex in the serum of workers in  a te x t il e  facto ry . The amount of the benzidine complex in the serum depended on the extent and duration of exposure to d ire c t d yestuffs in  the workplace [61]. In th is  study, the author compared the blood serum of female te x tile  m ill workers (18-60 years old) w ith th a t of nonindustrially-exposed blood donors. He found 22 of 77 workers p o te n tia lly  exposed to any type of dye had benzidine complexed to albumin in  the serum, compared with no instances of th is  complex in 24 nonindustrially-exposed blood donors. F urther, those workers exposed only to d ire c t dyes showed an incidence of 19 of 40, w hile 21 workers exposed to dyes th a t were not d ire c t dyes, or to other in d u s tria l substances, had no benzidine-album in complex in  th e ir serum. Since the major d ire c t dyes reported were benzidine-based [1 ,2 ,3 8 ], and the benzidine-album in complex was only found in  the workers exposed to d ire c t dyes, the only reasonable source of the benzidine in  the blood was from the benzidine-based dyes.
Thus, two Russian stu d ies [48,61] and one U S study [27] have demonstrated th a t benzidine or benzidine complexes are present in the body flu id s of humans exposed to benzidine-based dyes.
Animal M etabolic Studies
As early  as 1911, i t  was known th a t azo dyes could be m etabolized to sim pler components. S isley  and Porcher [62] reported th a t when dogs
16
received o ral doses of Orange 1, a monoazo dye, the dye was reductiv ely cleaved a t the azo linkage, re s u ltin g  in s u lf a n ilic  acid production in the u rine. S isley and Porcher fu rth e r demonstrated th a t i t  was necessary for Orange 1  to pass through the in te s tin a l tr a c t to be lysed. They suggested at th a t time th at the m icrobial flo ra  of the d ig estiv e tr a c t was e sse n tia l for the reduction of th is  dye [62]. In 1970, Walker reviewed the metabolism of azo compounds and concluded th a t many species of anim als, y ea st, and b acteria could reduce the azo linkage [55]. The n o n sp ecificity  of azoreductase has been repeatedly demonstrated [54-57]. This enzyme rap id ly  and e ffic ie n tly  breaks the double bond in the N = N  linkage reg ardless of the other e n titie s  in  the su b stra te .
The N ational Cancer I n s titu te  found th a t both ra ts  and mice can m etabolize benzidine-based dyes to benzidine [29]. P rio r to feeding D irect Black 38, D irect Brown 95, and D irect Blue 6 in the d ie t, the in v e stig a to rs analyzed each batch of dye, and detected no free benzidine (d etectio n lim it was 0.004%). The amounts of benzidine found in urine of the animals are given in Tables IV-3 and IV-4.
Although there was no d ire c t c o rre la tio n  between the amount of benzidine excreted in the urine and the incidence of tumors in r a ts , each animal fed dye excreted benzidine, and the amount excreted was d ose-related in most cases to the amount of dye adm inistered [29]. Since food consumption was not reported, individual dose-excretion ra tio s  could not be c a lc u la te d .
Benzidine was measured in the u rine of mice and ra ts  3 and 11 and 4 and 12 weeks, resp ectiv ely , a fte r the experiment began [29]. The mice excreted approximately the same amount of benzidine at 3 weeks as the ra ts  did a t 4 weeks, and, in general, the mice excreted considerably more at 11 weeks than ra ts  excreted a t 12 weeks. There were no tumors found in mice by 93 days, while high incidences were found in ra ts  exposed for the same period. Since benzidine alone did not produce tumors in ra ts  u n til approximately 6  months of exposure at high doses [14], the production of tumors in ra ts  by 93 days suggested th a t the parent dye (or a m etabolite other than benzidine) was the activ e carcinogen and th a t carcin og enicity  did not depend exclusively on the presence of benzidine, per se. The NCI report concluded th a t the benzidine found in urine was a product of dyebiotransform ation and not from a benzidine contaminant in the dye [29]. The ro le of other known carcinogens in these dyes, such as 4-amino biphenyl or 2,4-diaminoazobenzene [37], was not examined; since they were notsuspected contaminants a t th at tim e, no analy sis was carried  out toe sta b lis h  th e ir presence or absence. I t  should be noted th at the a n a ly tic a l techniques used in the NCI study were colo rim etric assays sim ilar to the one described in Appendix I . These methods are not sp e cific  for benzidine, and i t  is  possib le th at m etabolites and/or other aromatic amines were responsible for the colo rim etric response [29].

Aromatic amines, such as benzidine, produce tumors only in d ire c tly  [24]. They are f i r s t  converted by the body to a more rea c tiv e  substance, which has been termed the u ltim ate (or proximate) carcinogen [24]. The NCI in v estig ato rs [29] did not attem pt to id e n tify  sp e c ific  m etabolites of benzidine, and i t  is  not known i f  N-hydroxy d iacety l benzidine (one m etabolite suggested as the ultim ate carcinogen [24,63]) was among the m etabolites in e ith e r the r a t or mouse u rin e.
Rinde [34] and Rinde and T roll [64] reported th at when any of four benzidine-based dyes, D irect Blue 6, D irect Black 38, D irect Brown 95, and D irect Red 28 (Congo Red), was adm inistered to rhesus monkeys by gavage, benzidine and i t s  monoacetyl d eriv ativ e could be detected in the urine on an average of 1.25% of the benzidine moiety in the dyes studied. W henbenzidine i t s e l f  was fed, free benzidine and i t s  monoacetyl d eriv ativ e were detected in the urine on the average of 1.45% of the o rig in a l benzidine fed. The authors [34,64] concluded on the b asis of the above evidence that nearly to ta l conversion of the dye to benzidine took place. However, th is  may not be the case because w ater-soluble m etabolites of benzidine or the dye may c o n stitu te  a d iffe rin g  proportion of the m etabolites than the sparing ly -solu ble portion  [37].
Because each dye was adm inistered in  dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),absorption of the dye from the in te s tin e  would be expected to be g reater than when adm inistered in aqueous so lu tio n , since D M S O  enhances s o lu b ility  and absorption. Since no other m etabolites were in v e stig a te d , NIOSH does not consider the r e p o r t's  conclusion of complete conversion of benzidine- based dyes to benzidine as app rop riate. N evertheless, the fact was established th a t there is  a t le a s t p a r tia l conversion of each of the four dyes to benzidine under the conditions of the experiment.
D irect Black 38 and D irect Blue 6 dyes at 0.04% (400 ppm) were in jectedby N iitsu  [33] into  the lig a te d , incubated in te s tin e s  of mice. Benzidinewas iso la ted  from the in te s tin a l contents a fte r introducing D irect Black 38 but not a fte r introducing D irect Blue 6. D irect Black 38, D irect Green 1, D irect Red 17, and D irect Red 28 dyes were injected  by Yoshida and Miyakawa into lig a te d , incubated in te s tin e s  of mice and ra ts  in sim ilar experiments [47], Benzidine was detected as a m etabolic product of the dye in each case. In control experiments in which the dye so lu tio n  was in s tille d  into the in te s tin e s  th at were turned insid e out, no free benzidine was detected
[47].
Dieckhues [65] inv estig ated  the a b ility  of 21 common b a c te ria l species to reduce azo dyes. A ll species teste d  were capable of th is  actio n . D irect Red 10, D irect Red 17, D irect Red 28, D irect Orange 8, and D irect Black 38 were found to be su sceptib le to azo reduction in th is  study. Thus, b a c te ria l ly s is  of the azo bond in the in te s tin e  is  probably a basic means of producing benzidine from the benzidine-based dyes. This benzidine is then av ailab le to be absorbed in to  the body and excreted by the kidney to produce an e ffe c t on the bladder. An increase in the b a c te ria l 
azoreductase enzyme lev el in the in te s tin e  was brought about in Fischer 344 ra ts  by feeding a meat-based d ie t in place of the normal grain-based d ie t
20
[66]. I t  is  not known whether r a ts  given benzidine-based dyes together w ith a meat-based d ie t would excrete more benzidine in the urine than when fed the dyes together with a grain-based d ie t (such as used in the NCI stud y), but such an e ffe c t would not be unexpected. This is  s ig n ific a n t, since man generally consumes a d ie t high in meat p ro tein .
A  review a r tic le  on benzidine metabolism [55] called  a tte n tio n  to re s u lts  from various in v e stig atio n s [57,67] th at showed th a t a v a rie ty  of azo dyes including benzidine-based dyes were reducible at the azo linkage. In the case of azonaphthols, reduction occurred fa r more rea d ily  in the b a c te ria l system than the liv e r p reparatio n [57]. D irect Blue 6, however, while reducible in  vivo [2,34], was not reported to be reducible by the in te s tin a l b a c te ria  of female mice of a s tra in  designated as dd [33].
Yoshida et al reported in  1973 th a t D irect Black 38 (D irect Deep Black EX ) was reducible both by E  c o li and common s o il b a c te ria  [67]. The I £  c o li used were iso la te d  from humans. The common s o il b a c te ria  were those taken from s o il as w ell as from raw riv e r w ater. T hin-layer chromatography was used for benzidine d ete c tio n , and adequate negative and p o sitiv e controls were used. Benzidine was found to be a reduction product from a ll  b a c te ria l samples used. In ad d itio n , Yoshida et a l demonstrated th at 3 g of cotton clo th  dyed w ith D irect Black 38 yielded benzidine when incubated with the b a c te ria l flo ra  of raw riv e r water for 72 hours. The color of the fab ric faded under the action of the b a c te ria  but not when incubated for 2  weeks with d is ti l le d  w ater. This i s  the only in v e stig a tio n  found in the l ite r a tu r e  th a t d ealt with b a c te ria l breakdown of benzidine-based dyes once the dye is  attached to a fa b ric . The importance of th is  in v e stig atio n  can also be appreciated by considering th a t while in ta c t benzidine-based dyesmay not p en etrate the skin [34] , the benzidine portion of the molecule isread ily  absorbed through the skin [7-9,11,14,16,17,45]. Since E  c o li is a b ac te ria  commonly found on the skin, i t  i s  lik e ly  th a t the dye attached to a benzidine-based dyed fa b ric  th a t contacts the skin w ill break down to benzidine. Since benzidine can be absorbed d ire c tly  through the skin,fa b ric  with benzidine-based dyes can be a source of th is  compound. I I  co liis unusually re s is ta n t to the b a c te rio s ta tic  e ffe c t of dyes in general and grows a t tem peratures as low as 20 C  [68].
In 1977, K orosteleva e t a l [52] demonstrated th at ra ts  of an unspecified s tra in , given 500 m g of D irect Red 10 o ra lly  each day, could m etabolize th is  benzidine-based dye to benzidine, which then acted as a hapten forming a complex with p ro tein  in  the liv e r and kidney w ithin 4 days a fte r the i n i t i a l  dose. By the 30th day, the benzidine complex was present in the blood. The in v e stig a to rs reported a c o rre la tio n  between the carcinogenicity of D irect Red 10 and i t s  a b ility  to form antigens containing the benzidine moiety in  vivo.
Metabolism stu d ies on D irect Black 38 were recen tly  completed for NIOSH at the N ational Center for Toxicological Research, in Jefferso n , Arkansas [37]. S ensitive as w ell as sp e c ific  a n a ly tic a l chemical methods were developed for assay of the known and the proposed im purities in D irect Black 38 as w ell as i t s  known and proposed m etab o lites. Sim ilar studies
21
were carried  out for possible m etabolites of the substance Pigment Yellow 12, a pigment containing and deri-ved from 3 ,3 '-d ich lorob enzidine. This pigment was not metabolized to benzidine, dichlorobenzidine, 2,4- diaminoazobenzene, or 4-amino biphenyl, confirming p rio r stu d ies in other species [35].
F ifte e n  male Syrian golden hamsters weighing approximately 110 g were adm inistered D irect Black 38 a t 100 mg/kg by g a s tric  lavage [37]. Urine was co llected  for analysis a t in te rv a ls up to 7  days. Three hamsters were used as co n tro ls. The dry, p u rifie d  dye was analyzed and found to contain 3  ppm benzidine, 6 ppm 4-amino biphenyl, and 670 ppm 2,4-diaminoazobenzene. Further attem pts a t p u rific a tio n  to elim inate the 2,4-diaminoazobenzene were unsuccessful.
The major portion of a l l  m etabolites of D irect Black 38 was excreted w ithin 16 hours a fte r adm inistration. The average to ta ls  of m etabolites excreted by 16 hours are shown in  Table IV-5.

a carcinogen in the same manner as benzidine [7]. In ad d itio n , the presence of r e la tiv e ly  high concentrations of monoacetyl benzidine and hydrolyzable benzidine in the u rine means th a t at some point the to ta l exposure of each animal to benzidine in  th is  experiment must have been several orders of magnitude g reater than th a t indicated  by the concentration of benzidine i t s e l f  in the u rine [34,37]. In monkeys, Rinde [34] was able to recover approximately 1.5% of the benzidine contained in each of four benzidine-based dyes as benzidine or monoacetyl benzidine. A  major portion of benzidine would be expected to be excreted in a conjugated form and would not be detected unless the u rine is  f i r s t  tre ate d  with an a lk a li to hydrolyze the conjugates of benzidine. Methods developed up to th is  point have not included a hydrolysis step . Future methods for monitoring human u rine should u ti l iz e  a hydrolysis step to provide the most se n sitiv e  in d icato r of exposure to benzidine-based dyes [37].
The In te rn a tio n a l Business Machines Corporation recen tly  reported prelim inary data to the Environmental P rotection  Agency on a te s t to determine p ossib le skin absorption of D irect Black 38 in  ra b b its [69]. The diphenyl portion of D irect Black 38 was f i r s t  labeled with carbon-14. A  p ro p rietary  m ixture of D irect Black 38 was then applied to the skin of two ra b b its. At the end of 144 hours, 91%  of the ra d io a c tiv ity  was recovered in the urine and feces of the ra b b its. This in d ica te s th a t D irect Black 38 or a portion of the molecule had penetrated the sk in. Previous work by Rinde in monkeys had not shown skin absorption in th at species [34].
In another prelim inary study, Matthews [70] examined the following benzidine-based dyes: D irect Blue 2, D irect Black 4, D irect Brown 2,D irect Red 28, D irect Orange 8, and D irect Green 1. Each was fed to one of six female mongrel dogs a t 100 mg/kg. Benzidine i t s e l f  was fed to a seventh dog as a p o sitiv e  co n tro l. The tre ate d  dogs were held in individual metabolism cages, where they received food and water ad libitum . The u rine was co llected  d aily  for 3 days, and analyzed for benzidine. The amount of benzidine measured in  each urine varied from 320 to 1,675 /ig, b ut, in every case, dye adm inistration resu lte d  in the excretion of benzidine. In the case of D irect Brown 2, benzidine excretion a fte r adm inistration of the dye exceeded to ta l u rinary  benzidine excretion observed in the p o sitiv e  control dog given pure benzidine.
These re s u lts  increase to 11 the number of dyes th at have been demonstrated to be m etabolized to benzidine in  humans, monkeys, r a ts , ham sters, mice, or dogs [27,29,33,34,47,48,61,64,70].

V. EVALUATION AND CONCLUSIONS
Benzidine, an interm ediate in the sy nth esis of most benzidine-based dyes, is  con tro lled  as a human carcinogen in the workplace. When a Federal standard for benzidine (29 CFR 1910.1010) was promulgated in  1974, there was l i t t l e  evidence to suggest th at dyes prepared from benzidine were carcinogenic. Since then, a number of cases of bladder cancer have been reported in two groups of workers with exposure to benzidine-based dyes [47,48]. These rep o rts are meaningful in  th a t they provide evidence that man is  su scep tib le to the carcinogenic action of these dyes. However, the major evidence for the carcinogenic action  of benzidine-based dyes is found in contro lled  animal stu d ies. Rats fed D irect Blue 6, D irect Black 38, and D irect Brown 95 developed tumors in as l i t t l e  time as 5 weeks [29]. By 13 weeks, many exposed ra ts  developed hepatocarcinomas or n eo p lastic nodules. In a separate study in which ra ts  were fed D irect Red 10, carcinogenic a c tiv ity  was also demonstrated [52], In yet another study, D irect Black 38 was found to be carcinogenic in ra ts  when given at lower doses over a longeri  period of time [53]. Since the re s u lts  in animals support the findings in humans, i t  must be concluded th a t benzidine-based dyes may cause cancer in humans.
Studies on lig a te d  in te s tin e  [33] and b a c te ria  commonly present in the in te s tin e  [65] have shown th a t the azo linkage can be broken to y ield  benzidine from D irect Black 38, D irect Red 10, D irect Red 17, D irect Red 28, and D irect Orange 8. While in h alatio n  is  a major route of employee exposure to benzidine-based dyes [27,28,48], many of the inhaled dye p a rtic le s  may be too large to reach and be retain ed  in the lung. They then would be returned to the e p ig lo ttis  by the c i l i a l  action of the bronchial mucosa or trapped by nasal im paction, and then swallowed so that they become av a ila b le  for absorption by the body. In a d d itio n , hand to mouth tra n s fe r, contam ination of foods, or poor work p ra ctic es would lead to o ral ingestion of the dyes. B acterial reduction in  the in te s tin e  would represent one source of benzidine in such cases.
Other av ailab le evidence suggests th a t cleavage of the azo linkage of the dye also occurs a f te r  absorption of the dye, re su ltin g  in the release of benzidine in vivo. Benzidine has been found in the urine of workers who handled benzidine-based dyes in the dye manufacturing and te x tile  in d u strie s [27]. In a Russian study, about h a lf of the te x tile  m ill workers examined who handled d ire c t dyes had benzidine-album in complexes in the blood [61]. In another Russian study, 8 of 22 workers who handled benzidine-based and o-dianisidine-based dyes had benzidine in the urine[48]. In th is  l a t t e r  study, examination of company records revealed fiv e cases of bladder cancer. Benzidine has also  been id e n tifie d  in the urine of mice [29], ra ts  [29], hamsters [22,37], dogs [70], and monkeys [34,64] exposed to a number of benzidine-based dyes.
F urther research is  needed to c la rify  the issu e of skin absorption of the dyes. However, i t  is  known th at D irect Black 38 can be reduced to
24
benzidine by b ac te ria  commonly found on the skin [67]. This suggests that the dermal route could be a source of employee exposure since benzidine is  read ily  absorbed through the skin [9]. Prelim inary work in ra b b its supports th is  as a possib le route of exposure [69].
The evidence presented above dem onstrates th a t benzidine is  a m etabolic product of at le a s t .1 1  benzidine-based dyes. The azoreductase enzyme th at breaks down these dyes to benzidine is  ubiquitous and generic. I t  acts on a m ultitude of azo compounds, containing a large v a rie ty  of individual components and has been observed to cleave the N = N  linkage common to these compounds. The a b ility  to be metabolized in vivo to a known carcinogen is s u ffic ie n t evidence to n e c e ssita te  reg u latio n  of a l l  benzidine-based dyes. In ad d itio n , animal experiments have suggested th at these dyes could have a g reater p o te n tia l for carcinogenicity  than benzidine alone, since the dyes have been reported to form tumors much more quickly than benzidine [29]. Therefore, benzidine-based dyes may be a more robust source of the ultim ate carcinogen. Im purities introduced in  the manufacture of the dye may also be a fa c to r. For example, 4-amino biphenyl and 2 ,4-diaminoazobenzene were id e n tifie d  in commercially prepared D irect Black 38 [37]. Bothcontaminants are important because 2 ,4-diaminoazobenzene is  considered a carcinogen by IA R C  [SO] and 4-amino biphenyl is  regulated as a human carcinogen (29 CFR 1910.1011). Mutagenesis te s ts  using the Salmonella typhimurium (TA-98 and TA-100) assay with a c tiv a tio n  were p o sitiv e  for the following substances: the urine of hamsters fed D irect Black 38, the majorm etabolites of th is  dye (benzidine, monoacetyl benzidine, d iacety l benzidine, and 4-amino biphenyl), and the dye i t s e l f  [37,72].
Studies have reported th a t four benzidine-based dyes rap id ly  induce cancer in experim ental anim als, suggesting th a t these substances may have a g reater carcinogenic p o te n tia l than can be a ttrib u te d  to th e ir m etabolite benzidine alone. Other stu d ies have reported a number of cases of bladder cancer in two groups of workers exposed to benzidine-based dyes, but not to benzidine. In add itio n, a l l  of the 11 benzidine-based dyes thus fa r tested  have c o n sisten tly  been m etabolized in animals to the carcinogen benzidine. The azoreductase enzyme responsible for form ation of benzidine in  the body is  known to be nonspecific in i t s  action and is  found in b a c te ria , anim als, and humans. Occupational exposure to benzidine-based dyes has also resu lte d  in benzidine form ation in the bodies of workers. This then in d icates th a t there is  an extremely high p ro b a b ility  th a t those yet untested benzidine-based dyes can be metabolized to benzidine also . Based on a combination of the above fa c to rs , NIOSH concludes th a t a l l  benzidine- based dyes, reg ardless of th e ir physical s ta te  or proportion in a m ixture, should be recognized as p o te n tia l human carcinogens. In a d d itio n , NIOSH recommends th a t the production, use, storage, packaging, and d is trib u tio n  of a l l  benzidine-based dyes be discontinued in  lig h t of present evidence o p o te n tia l carcinogenic ris k s . The replacement of benzidine-based dyes with less toxic s u b s titu te s should be in itia te d  immediately. As an interim  measure, strin g e n t con tro ls and work p ra ctic es are recommended to minimize 
exposure to any of the benzidine-based dyes.
25
During th is  interim  period, since the carcinogens benzidine, 4-amino biphenyl, and 2 ,4-diaminoazobenzene have been id e n tifie d  as contaminants or breakdown products of a commercially prepared benzidine-based dye [37], p a rtic u la r a tte n tio n  should be given to the possible increase in concentration of these im p urities in  the cleanup of s p ills  or leaks, waste d isp o sal, and hot dyeing processes.
A  number of rep o rts have considered or re fe rre d  to the use of su b s titu te s to replace benzidine-based dyes [2 ,5,28,32 ,4 0]. Several companies now market s u b s titu te s  fo r each commercially important benzidine- based dye (including D irect Black 38) [43]. A  number of the d ire c t dye s u b s titu te s , however, are based on the benzidine congeners o -to lid in e  and o -d ian isid in e. NIOSH has previously concluded th a t there is reason to believe th a t o -to lid in e  w ill induce bladder cancer in humans [73]. A  study conducted for NCI has demonstrated the carcinogenic a c tiv ity  of o- d ian isid in e in animals [74] . Inform ation a v a ila b le , however, on the metabolism and carcinogenic e ffe c ts  of the dyes containing these congeners is  extremely lim ited. Although there is  as yet no inform ation on the carcinogenic p o te n tia l of o -d ian isid in e dyes, lim ited animal studies have demonstrated a carcinogenic e ffe c t of two o -to lid in e  dyes [75]. In the absence of ad d itio n al inform ation, NIOSH recommends th a t the benzidine congener dyes be handled with extreme care in the workplace and that exposure to these dyes be minimized.
S u b stitu tio n  of noncarcinogenic dyes for those th at are benzidine-based is  e s s e n tia l. However, i t  must be recognized th at the s tru c tu ra l requirem ents for a compound to impart color leads to the use of dyes containing m oieties th a t tend to be chemically rea c tiv e  and to x ic. Thus, the p o s s ib ility  of m etabolic conversion to even more tox ic compounds, as w ell as the e ffe c ts of the dye i t s e l f ,  must be considered. In add itio n , toxic im purities can be introduced in  m anufacture. Inform ation on the toxic e ffe c ts of p ossib le su b s titu te s  should be taken into account during replacement of benzidine-based dyes. If such inform ation is  incomplete or suggests th a t the dye might also have carcinogenic p o te n tia l, other su b s titu te s must be used.

VI. WORK. PRACTICES AND CONTROL RECOMMENDATIONS
This sectio n  evaluates the conditions under which employee exposure to benzidine-based dyes is  lik e ly . I t  also d elin e a tes those operations in which the most intense exposures would be p redicted in  the absence of co n tro ls. Emphasis is  placed on work p ra ctic es and control recommendations to lim it excessive employee exposure to benzidine-based dyes in  operations th at can be p a rtic u la rly  hazardous. The employer should, in addition, evaluate ex istin g  programs for labeling and posting, employee education, cleanup of s p i l l s , disp osal of w aste, emergencies, and general p lant sa n ita tio n  to ensure th e ir adequacy in  lig h t of evidence of carcinogenicity  of the benzidine-based dyes. If present programs are inadequate, new ones should be implemented to ensure a clean and h ea lth fu l workplace and to ensure th a t employees are aware of the hazards involved and of th e ir ro le  in  m aintaining a safe working environment.
During manufacture, the dyes are generally prepared in a closed system in which benzidine is  formed by the re a c tio n  of the s ta rtin g  m a teria l, hydrazobenzene, w ith hydrochloric acid [27]. One dye manufacturer hasdeveloped a process th a t uses nitrobenzene as the s ta rtin g  m a teria l, thus elim inating the need for employees to handle hydrazobenzene, which forms benzidine in  the stomach if  ingested [45]. A fter the dye is  p re c ip ita te d , however, generally i t  is handled in  open systems [27]. The dye is  filte r e d  in  presses and the press cake is  unloaded manually. The press cake is  then d ried , and the dried dye is  ground in to  a fin e powder. This fin e  powder is then tra n sfe rre d  to ribbon blenders where other dyes are often  admixed to obtain the desired colors. Sulfonated dedusting o il is  u su ally  added at th is  point to reduce the tendency fo r the dye to produce an aerosol when poured or mixed. S alt or sugar is nearly always added to d ilu te  the concentrated dye [41]. The f in a l product is then weighed and packaged for m arketing.
Processes in which dried dye is handled have the g re a te st p o te n tia l for employee exposure during the manufacture or repackaging of benzidine-based dyes; such processes should be performed in closed systems. Access to such areas should be re s tr ic te d  to authorized employees. When such enclosure is not p o ssib le, each operation should be provided w ith continuous local exhaust v e n tila tio n  so th a t a ir  movement is  always from surrounding work areas to the operation and then through su ita b le  f i l t e r s  as described in O S H A  safety  and h ealth  standards (29 CFR 1910), so as to prevent the release of any benzidine-based dye to the work environment.
Handling of moist press cakes and so lu tio n s c o n stitu te s a lesse r source of employee exposure to benzidine-based dyes than handling dry powders, since so lu tio n s and moist m aterials are less lik e ly  to be dispersed in to  the a ir  or d istrib u te d  over large areas. N evertheless, closed systems should be used to fu rth er lim it employee exposure to benzidine-based dyes. F ilte r  presses th a t can be emptied and decontaminated w ithout opening the f i l t e r s  have been used fo r preparatio n of benzidine s u lfa te  [45], and the
27
use of th is  type of f i l t e r  should also be app licable in the manufacture of 
the dyes.
Various methods of elim inating the dust hazard associated w ith dyes have been used. In addition to the treatm ent w ith sulfonated o ils  referred  to above, two other methods are p resently  employed [41]. One method is  to form the dye in to  p e lle ts  so th a t dusting is  minimized. The other procedure is  to make up the dyes in u n itized  double packages. The outer package, which is  used for p ro tectio n  during shipment, contains an inner package th a t dissolves in w ater. Thus, the worker making up a dye bath would add the appropriate number of u n its of dye to the bath w ithout opening the inner package. These procedures may be combined for added safety  (a dye package of p e lle ts  in double p a c k e ts).
Pastes ra th e r than dried dyes have been used by the paper industry for some time [39,41]. In th is  case, the paste is  added to a large container of an aqueous so lu tio n  and th a t so lu tio n  is  metered to each batch of paper 
as i t  is  dyed.
Benzidine-based dyes are used in  the paper, t e x t il e , and leath er fin ish in g  in d u strie s. Since the in d u strie s are d iv erse, i t  would be expected th a t the conditions of p o te n tia l exposure to benzidine-based dyes are equally diverse. At le a s t 63 occupational categories have been found to be associated w ith p o te n tia l exposure to benzidine-based dyes [44]. In the f a c i l i t i e s  surveyed by NIOSH [27], a th ree -ste p  process fo r handling the benzidine-based dyes was c h a ra c te ris tic  of a l l  three in d u strie s. F ir s t, a dye weigher dispensed the m aterial in to  a v esse l. In some cases the weigher also dissolved the dry d y estu ffs. Next, the m aterial to be dyed and the dissolved dye were placed in a dyeing v a t. F in a lly , the dyed m aterial was dried and fin ish ed . The degree of worker exposure in areas where paper, te x tile s , or lea th e r are being dyed would be expected to vary widely depending on conditions such as the tem perature of the dye so lu tio n , the amount of manual handling of the dyed m a te ria l, and the design of the dye v a ts. Employees who handle paper, te x t il e s , or le a th e r a fte r i t  is dyed could also be exposed to benzidine-based dyes since excess dye retain ed  on the fin ish ed  m aterial would be av ailab le for re lea se  as dried powder.
During use of benzidine-based dyes, the g re a te st p o te n tia l fo r exposure would be expected to be among dye-weighers who handle dry powders [27]. Their operations should be carried  out in a hood designed and m aintained so as to draw a ir  inward at an average lin e a r face v elo city  of 150 fe e t per minute (0.76 m/s) with a minimum of 125 fe e t per minute (0.64 m /s). P a rtic u la r a tte n tio n  should be paid to the design of such hoods to ensure th a t the employee can tra n s fe r the m aterial from i t s  o rig in a l container to the weighing scale w ithout taking any dye outside the enclosure or in se rtin g  any p art of the body other than hands and arms in sid e the hood. Containers of benzidine-based dyes should be opened only during the weighing operation. Once opened, they should remain w ithin the hood u n til disp osal or u n til a l l  the contents have been used. The use of pastes or liq u id s ra th e r than dried dyes should be considered as a control measure.
28
The dye weigher should prepare the dye so lu tio n s to be placed in the v ats. This procedure would elim inate the need to tra n s fe r the more hazardous drym aterial from one s ta tio n  to another. The dye weighing area should beregulated, and access should be lim ited to authorized employees who arewearing adequate personal p ro tectiv e equipment adequate to prevent skin contact with or in h a la tio n  of the dyes. I f  workers must handle the m aterial in the v ats manually, or i f  adjustm ents to machinery are necessary w hile benzidine-based dye is  p resen t, the worker must wear impervious clothing and re sp ira to ry  p ro tectio n  to prevent exposure to the dyes.
T ex tiles are dyed a t various stages in  th e ir manufacture, including unspun fib e rs , unwoven yarn, and fin ish ed  fa b ric . Workers who prepare fa b rics from unspun fib e rs are of p a rtic u la r concern, since they could be p o te n tia lly  exposed to benzidine-based dyes contained on dusts generated during m anufacture. In ad d itio n , some benzidine-based dyes possess much poorer fastn ess to wet treatm ent than do o th ers; persons who launder such clothing are p o te n tia lly  exposed to the dyes. Employees and employers should be aware th a t those who launder, weave, or sew fa b rics dyed withbenzidine-based dyes are p o te n tia lly  exposed to the dyes. I f  exposure is considered lik e ly , the employer should in s t i tu te  strin g e n t control measures and work p ra ctic es to prevent such exposure.
Several generally acceptable p ra ctic es fo r the control of hazardous m aterials are recommended wherever there is  p o te n tia l for exposure [45,76]. For example, pressure fa ilu re  alarms fo r closed systems and exhaust v e n tila tio n  can rapidly  in d ica te  a system f a ilu re  th a t might re s u lt in the release of su b sta n tia l q u a n titie s of benzidine-based dyes. Continuous flow in d ica to rs, such as w ater or o il manometers properly mounted at the juncture of a fume hood and duct th ro at and marked to in d ica te  acceptable airflow , w ill give a rea d ily  observable in d icatio n  of decreased efficien cy  in  the v e n tila tio n  system for the hood. Wet methods, vacuum cleaning, or other methods th a t do not lead to red isp ersio n  of s e ttle d  dust should be used fo r plan t maintenance and s a n ita tio n . Dry sweeping or blowing with compressed a ir  should be p ro h ib ited . In the cleanup of leaks or s p ills  and in  maintenance or re p a ir operations on contaminated systems or equipment, employees should wear clean impervious garments, including at le a s t gloves, boots, and an a ir-su p p lied  re s p ira to r with p o sitiv e  pressure in the facepiece.
Benzidine is  rea d ily  absorbed through the skin , and reuse of p ro tectiv e equipment or work clothing contaminated with benzidine can lead to i t s  dermal absorption [7 ,8 ]. However, evidence for dermal absorption of the benzidine-based dyes is  c o n flic tin g  [34,69], As a prudent measure, absorption of benzidine-based dyes through the skin must be considered a re a l p o s s ib ility  [69], Thus, employee exposure through contaminated clothing may be as serious a problem fo r benzidine-based dyes as i t  is  for benzidine [7 ,9 ,1 1,16 ]. P a rtic u la te  m aterial containing the dyes can be released into  the extern al environment, including the employee's home, unless clothing p o te n tia lly  contaminated w ith the dyes is  removed before 
the employee leaves the exposure area. I f  an employee's skin is p o te n tia lly  contaminated w ith benzidine-based dyes, the employee should wash or shower as appropriate before leaving the exposure area.

VII.  MONITORING METHODS
Workplace Air
At th is  time, NIOSH is  unaware of a p ra c tic a l method for id en tify in g  each s p e c ific  benzidine-based dye workers may be exposed to . I t  should be possible to id e n tify  classes of azo dyes such as the benzidine-based dyes by the use of high performance liq u id  chromatography or gas chromatography a fte r reduction of the azo linkage. A dditional research is generally needed in  th is  area.
Although methods to measure the concentration of an individ ual benzidine-based dye in a ir  are not a v a ila b le, a screening method for diazonium s a lts  and azo dyes in a ir has been developed by NIOSH [71] and is described in  Appendix 1(A). The range of the method is  lis te d  as 0.01-0.4 mg/cu m  in  a 500-l i t e r  sample of a ir . If only one benzidine-based dye ispresent and other p o sitiv e  in terferen c es are absent, a q u a n titativ eestim ate of the concentration of the dye p resent in  the a ir can be made.If more than one azo dye of any type is  p resen t, the method is  notq u a n tita tiv e  and the concentration of to ta l azo dye present must be given as a range. However, the method can in d ica te  the adequacy of work p ra ctic es and engineering controls employed to minimize the concentration of airborne benzidine-based dyes during the period required to phase in su b s titu te  dyes.
Urinary Levels
Aromatic diamines, such as benzidine, are not normally found in  the body. However, benzidine, a m etabolic product of benzidine-based dyes, has appeared in the u rine of employees exposed to the dyes but not to benzidine. This dem onstrates systemic absorption of the dye or a portion th ereo f. C urrently, the measurement of u rinary  benzidine is  used more as a diag no stic p ra c tic e  than for use in  compliance. The presence of benzidine in the u rine of a worker p o te n tia lly  exposed to a benzidine-based dye would v e rify  th a t such exposure had, in f a c t, occurred, but i t s  absence cannot be considered v e r if ic a tio n  th a t no exposure has occurred.
The method recommended in Appendix 1(B) can d etect the presence of arom atic amines a t 100 ng/100 ml of u rin e , although recovery efficien cy  at the lim it of d etectio n  is  poor. If aromatic amines are found in the u rin e , th in -la y e r chromatography (TLC) can be used to confirm (though not rigorously prove) the presence of benzidine. The to ta l volume of the sample must be no less than 100 ml; the minimum d etectio n  lim it in such a volume is  300 ng. An Rf value id e n tic a l to th a t of benzidine co n stitu tes th is  confirm ation. If benzidine is  detected by u rin a ly s is , i t  would 
demonstrate th a t employee exposure to benzidine or benzidine-based dyes has occurred and would suggest inadequacies in e ith e r engineering controls or work p ra c tic e s. Thus, u rin a ly sis in add itio n  to environmental monitoring
30
is  necessary to assure the employer th a t exposure of employees to 
benzidine-based dyes has been minimized.
S pecific methods for the d etectio n  of benzidine in human [59,77] and hamster [37] u rin e and in  in d u s tria l e fflu en ts [78] have been developed. Tw o [37,59] are based on electro n -cap tu re gas chromatography, one is  based on high performance liq u id  chromatography [78], and one is  a spectro photo flu orim etric technique [77]. Unlike the fluorescam ine method [73] or the method given in Appendix 1(B), they can measure benzidine in the presence of other aromatic amines. While a l l  these methods should be re a d ily  adaptable to d etectio n  of benzidine in  an employee's u rin e , they involve considerably more elaborate instrum entation and a n a ly tic a l techniques than the ro u tin e screening method described in  Appendix 1(B).Several points need fu rth er c la r if ic a tio n  before the amount of benzidine inthe u rin e can be co rrelated  p recisely  w ith the concentration of benzidine- based dyes in  the a ir . For example, the optimum conditions fo r sample c o llec tio n  are not known. The N C TR  study [37] recommended alk alin ehydrolysis of the u rine to measure both free and conjugated benzidine.Since u rin a ly sis is p resen tly  u sefu l as a q u a lita tiv e  index of exposure only, the less elab o rate screening method c o n stitu te s the b est approach a t th is  time.

APPENDIX I - ANALYSIS
(A) M E T H O D  FO R M O N ITO R IN G  D IA ZO N IU M  SA LTS A N D  A Z O  D Y E S  IN AIR
A  screening method fo r analy sis of benzidine-based dyes found in  the workplace has been developed by NIOSH [71] and is  presented below. A  negative survey using th is  methodology is  considered adequate to e stab lish  th a t workers are not s ig n ific a n tly  exposed to the benzidine-based dyes.
A nalyte: Diazonium S alts Method No. : P & C A M  234and Azo Dyes
Matrix : Air Range : 0.01 to 0.4 mg/cu m  in  a5 0 0 -lite r sample of a ir
Procedure: F ilte r  c o lle c tio n ; P recision  (CV): 0.12UV-VIS spectrophotometry (a n aly tic a l)
Date Issued : 6/30/76 C la ss ific a tio n  : D(Operational)
P rin cip le of the Method
D uplicate samples of airborne p a rtic u la te  m a teria l are co llected  on c e llu lo se  aceta te  membrane f i l t e r s .  One f i l t e r  is extracted  w ith d ilu te  hydrochloric acid and analyzed for diazonium s a lts  spectrophotom etrically at 375 nm. The second f i l t e r  is extracted with an appropriate solvent and a spectrophotom etric scan of the so lu tio n  is  made in  the 400- to 700-nm range. The absorbance maxima are compared w ith the absorbance maxima of standard so lu tio n s prepared from bulk samples of the azo dyes.
Range and S e n sitiv ity
(a) Diazonium s a lts  and azo dyes follow  a B eer's law re la tio n sh ip  inthe range of 5-200 (ig in 40 ml of solv ent, the volume used toe x tra c t the f i l t e r s .  This corresponds to 0.01-0.4 mg/cu m  in  a 5 0 0 -lite r a ir  sample.
(b) D ilution of the sample so lu tio n  w ith the appropriate solvent may be used to extend the upper lim it of the range.
(c) The lower lim it of the range can be extended by decreasing thevolume of the extractin g  solvent or by using an absorption c e ll of longer length.
39
(d) The s e n s i t i v i t y  i s  determ ined by the a b s o r p t i v i t i e s  o f the  
in d iv id u a l s a l t s  and d y e s .
In te r fe r e n c e s
Any compound th at absorbs r a d ia t io n  at the w avelength s corresponding to  
the absorbance maxima of the diazonium s a l t s  and azo dyes i s  a p o s i t iv e  
i n t e r f e r e n c e .
P r e c is io n  and A ccu racy
(a) An averge c o e f f i c i e n t  of v a r i a t i o n  of 0 . 1 2  has been e s ta b lis h e d  
fo r  the a n a l y t i c a l  procedure over the co n ce n tra tio n  range of the  
method.
(b) The re c o v e ry  of s a l t s  and dyes from f i l t e r s  w ith  the a p p ro p ria te  
so lv e n t y ie ld e d  an e f f i c i e n c y  of 95+5% in  the range of 5-20 0  /xg/40  
ml of s o lv e n t.
(c) The accu ra cy of the o v e r a ll sam pling and a n a l y t i c a l  method has not  
been determ ined.
Advantages and D isad van tages
(a) The sam pling procedure is  r a p id , sim p le , and in v o lv e s  no liq u id s .
(b) The procedure can be used to d is t in g u is h  between diazonium s a l t s  
and azo dyes but not between two s a l t s  or two dyes absorbing a t  
the same w avelength .
(c) S in ce  diazonium  s a l t s  e x h ib it maximum a b so rp tio n  a t  ap proxim ately  
3 7 5  nm, the method cannot be used fo r  q u a l i t a t i v e  i d e n t i f i c a t i o n  
o f in d iv id u a l s a l t s .  Thus the t o t a l  diazonium s a l t  co n ce n tratio n  
must be rep o rted  i f  more than one s a l t  i s  bein g processed in  the  
t e s t in g  area on the day of sam pling. S in c e  each s a l t  has a  
c h a r a c t e r i s t i c  a b s o r p t iv i t y , the co n ce n tra tio n  of t o t a l  diazonium  
s a l t s  must be g ive n  as a ran ge. The s a l t  having the h ig h e st  
a b s o r p t iv i t y  determ ines the upper lim i t  o f the range and the s a l t  
having the low est a b s o r p t iv i t y  determ ines the lower l im i t .
(d) Diazonium s a l t s  d e t e r io r a t e  in  the p resen ce of l i g h t  and m o istu re.  
Care must be taken to s to re  them in  a d ry environment and to  
m inimize exposure to l i g h t .
(e) Bulk samples of a l l  of the diazonium  s a l t s  p rocessed  in  the  
t e s t in g  a rea on the day of sam pling must be c o lle c t e d  and a  
c a li b r a t i o n  cu rve must be e s ta b lis h e d  fo r  each.

(g) A b so rp tio n  cu rves must be e s ta b lis h e d  fo r  a l l  azo dyes processed
in  the p la n t on the day of sam pling. Azo dyes e x h ib it maxima in
the 400- to 700-nm ran g e , the e x a c t w avelength being dependent on
the s t r u c t u r e  of the dye m olecu le.
(h) I f  more than one azo dye is  being processed  on the day of sampling  
and th ose dyes absorb at a common w avele n g th , the t o t a l  azo dye  
co n ce n tra tio n  must be re p o rte d . The co n ce n tra tio n  of t o t a l azo

42
(c) Analysis of Samples
(1) Diazonium S alts
E xtract one of the dup licate sample f i l t e r s  from each s ite  w ith 40 ml of 0.1 N  HCl in  a 100-ml beaker. A gitate the m ixture in an u ltra so n ic  b ath for 5 minutes. Allow the f i l t e r  and any suspended so lid s to s e ttle . E x tract a blank f i l t e r  in  the same manner. Perform the ex tractio n s with minimum exposure to lig h t. Transfer a portion of each so lu tio n  to a 1-, 5-, or 10-cm fused s i l i c a  c e ll, depending on the an ticip ated  diazonium s a l t  concentration. Determine the absorbance of the blank and the sample of 375 nm. Use0.1 N  HCl as the reference so lu tio n .
(2) Azo Dyes
S elect an appropriate solvent by experim entation w ith the bulk samples. (See Advantages and D isadvantages, sectio n ( f ) .)  E xtract one of the d u p licate sample f i l t e r s  and a blank f i l t e r  with the solvent using the ex tractio n  procedure outlined in  sectio n  (1) on Diazonium S a lts. Tranfer a portion of each so lu tio n  to a 1-, 5-, or 10-cm fused s i l ic a  c e ll, depending on the an ticip ated  concentration. Using the solvent as a reference, scan the 400- to 700-nm range to lo cate the absorbance maxima. Measure the absorbance a t each wavelength where the bulk azo dyes absorb. (See C alib ratio n  and Standards (b) Azo Dyes.)
C alibratio n and Standards
(a) Diazonium S alts
(1) Prepare a se t of fiv e standards for each diazonium s a lt th at may be present in the sample. Each s e t should con sist ofstandards containing 5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 ¿ ¿ g  of onediazonium s a l t in 40 ml of 0.1 N  HCl.
(2) Transfer a p ortion of each so lu tio n  to a 1-, 5-, or 10-cmfused s i l ic a  c e ll.
(3) Using the 0.1 N  HCl so lu tio n  as the reference so lu tio n ,determine the absorbance of each standard a t 375 nm.
(4) Construct a standard curve for each diazonium s a lt byp lo ttin g  the absorbance against the amount (in  micrograms) of the ind ividual diazonium s a lt in  the corresponding standard.
43
(b) Azo Dyes
(1) Prepare a se t of standards for each azo dye as in  Section (a)(1) using the appropriate solv ent.
(2) Tranfer each so lu tio n  to a 1-, 5-, or 10-cm fused s i lic a  
c e ll.
(3) Scan the spectrum of one standard so lu tio n  for each d iffe re n t dye to determine the wavelength of maximum absorption. Use the solvent as the reference so lu tio n .
(4) Determine the absorbance of each standard at the wavelength of i t s  maximum.
(5) Construct a standard curve for each azo dye by p lo ttin g  the absorbance against the amount (in  micrograms) of the ind ivid ual azo dye in the corresponding standard.
C alculations
(a) Diazonium S alts
(1) If only one diazonium s a l t is  present in  the sample, readfrom the appropriate c a lib ra tio n  curve the amount (inmicrograms) corresponding to the absorbance of the sample.
(2) If more than one diazonium s a l t  is  p resen t, the re s u lts  mustbe given as a range. (See A dvantages and Disadvantages( f ) .)  From the c a lib ra tio n  curve fo r each diazonium s a l t , read the amount (in  micrograms) corresponding to theabsorbance of the sample. The upper lim it of the range is taken from the curve y ieldin g the la rg e s t value. The lower lim it of the range is  taken from the curve y ieldin g  the lowest value.
(b) Azo Dyes
(1) If only one azo dye is present in  the sample, read from theappropriate c a lib ra tio n  curve the amount (in  micrograms) corresponding to the absorbance of the sample at the wavelength of maximum absorption.
(2) If more than one azo dye is  p resen t, the re s u lts  must begiven as a range. (See A dvantages and Disadvantages (h ).) From the c a lib ra tio n  curve for each azo dye absorbing a t thesame wavelength as the sample, read the amount (in
micrograms) of azo dye corresponding to the absorbance of the sample. The upper lim it of the range is  taken from the curve
44
y ieldin g the la rg e st value. The lower lim it of the range is taken from the curve yielding  the lowest value.
(c) Correct the calcu lated  amount or range of amounts of the appropriate diazonium salt(.s) or azo dye(s) fo r any corresponding value found by the analysis of blank f i l t e r s .
(d) The concentration or range of concentrations of diazonium s a lts  and azo dyes may be expressed in mg/cu m:
mg/cu m  = Amount ((ug)g)Vs (in  l i t e r s )
where: Vs = volume ( l ite r s )  of a ir  sampled.

APPENDIX I - ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)
(B) M E T H O D  FO R M O N ITO R IN G  FO R BENZIDINE IN URINE
NIOSH has reviewed the various methods of b io lo g ica l monitoring for benzidine and re late d  chemicals. There are two acceptable methods: therecommended method th a t follows [79] and the fluorescam ine method given in the o -to lid in e  c r i te r i a  document [73]. The recommended method presented here is  le s s expensive and more se n sitiv e  than the fluorescam ine method; however, i t  requires a longer working tim e. N either method is  sp ecific for benzidine.
Any other method of at le a s t equal s e n s itiv ity  and precisio n may be su b stitu ted  for the recommended method [37,59,78].

P rin cip le of the Method
Aromatic amines, including benzidine, are extracted from urine with chloroform a fte r pH  adjustm ent. The chloroform e x tra c t is  back extracted into  0.1 N  H C 1 and d eriv atized  w ith 2 ,4 ,6 -trin itro b en zen e sulfonic acid (TNBS). The T N B S d eriv a tiv es are extracted with chloroform to remove in te rfe rin g  chromophores and the fin a l chloroform ex tra c t q uan titated spectrophotom etrically a t 400 nm  while using benzidine as a standard. The re su ltin g  chloroform e x tra c t is  concentrated to d roplet volume for benzidine id e n tific a tio n  by th in -la y e r chromatography (TLC). A ttention is called  to the poor s ta b i l ity  of the chloroform so lu tio n  of the T N B S d eriv ativ e of benzidine. Q uan titation of th is  d eriv ativ e by colorim etry 
should be performed w ithin 30-45 minutes a fte r preparation of the fin a l chloroform so lu tio n .

(a) The d etectio n  lim it of th is  spectrophotom etric procedure is 100 ngof benzidine (aromatic amine) per 100 ml of u rin e. The d etectio n  lim it forbenzidine by T L C  is 300 ng/100 ml u rine.
(b) The range is  from the d etectio n  lim it up to. 20,000 ng/100 ml ofurine.
(c) The U V  and/or v is ib le  d etecto r (maximum absorbance, 400 nm) has a lin e a r response up to 0.02 m g of benzidine per 100 ml of u rine.Range and Sensitivity
In terferen ces
(a) Any other aromatic amine having an absorbance maximum a t 400 nm  and an Rf value id e n tic a l to th a t of benzidine when chromatographed by T L C  would in te rfe re .
(b) Aromatic amines in  substances th a t are normally p resen t, ingested, or produced by m etabolic processes in the worker w ill produce a chromophore (fa lse  p o s itiv e ).
(c) E xtraction a t pH  5 with chloroform and subsequent back ex tractio n  into H C 1 reduce in terferen ce from other compounds.
P recision and Accuracy
(a) Recovery stu d ies conducted on benzidine in d icate 70%  a t the 500 ng/100 ml lev el and a marked decrease (about 20%) at the 100 ng/100 mlle v e l.
(b) The p recisio n  has not been evaluated at th is  time.
Advantages and Disadvantages
(a) The p rin c ip a l advantage is  th a t the method is  sp e c ific  for aromatic amines in the nanogram range.
(b) Another advantage is  th a t benzidine a t 300 ng/100 ml can be confirmed by TLC  in conjunction w ith the method. I t  should be noted that the TLC  confirm ation data does not prove th a t the chromophore i s  benzidine. More rigorous methods must be used for absolute confirm ation.
(c) The disadvantages of the method are the com plexities of the procedure (emulsions and losses in e x tra c tio n s ), n o n sp ecificity  for benzidine, and the increased time fo r confirm ation by TLC.
47
(d) A  rigorous sp e c ific  method for benzidine in u rine has recently  been published [37,59]. I t  uses fluoroanhydride d e riv a tiz a tio n  and electro n  capture gas chromatography, but req uires considerable more time and equipment to perform.

Procedure
(a) Cleaning of Glassware
(1) A ll glassware used for the laboratory analysis should be treated  with chromic acid, rinsed with tap water and washed in detergent. The glassware is  rin sed  thoroughly in d is t il le d  w ater and a ir  dried.
(2) Samples of "spot" urine (150 ml) are co llected  following 6  hours of suspected exposure to benzidine-based azo dyes.
(3) Samples should be co llected  in  polyethylene b o ttle s  and, ifnot analyzed on the same day, should be frozen u n til an aly sis can be done.
(b) Analysis of Samples
(1) One hundred m i l l i l i t e r s  of w ell mixed u rine is  adjusted to pH5.0 to 6.0 (1 N  H C 1 or 1  N  NaOH) in a g lass b o ttle  (180-ml capacity ). Acontrol urine sample (100 ml) and a control urine sample (.100 ml) spiked with benzidine (300-1000 ng) should be analyzed concurrently with the unknown samples.
(2) Add 0.2 g NaCl c ry sta ls to the pH adjusted u rine.
49
(3) The urine is  extracted with 10 ml of chloroform for 2minutes. I f  an emulsion is  formed, then centrifu ge to separate the two phases. The chloroform fra c tio n  (organic phase) is  collected  and saved.
(4) The u rine is  extracted twice more with chloroform (10 m l),and a ll  three of the chloroform fra c tio n s are combined.
(5) R eextract the combined chloroform m ixture with 2 ml of 0.1 N  H C 1 fo r 30 minutes on a ro ta to r.
(6) Transfer the aqueous phase (about 2 ml) into a cu ltu re tube(16x125 m m ) using a Pasteur p ip et.
(7) Add 2 ml of pH 5.5 b uffer and 0.7 ml of T N B S reagent, mixw ell, and l e t  stand fo r 15 minutes a t room tem perature. A  reagent blank isprepared by adding 2 ml of 0.1 N  H C 1 to 2 ml of pH  5.5 sodium acetateb uffer and 0.7 ml T N B S reagent and is  tre ate d  as a sample.
(8) Add 2 ml of CHC13 and shake for 1  minute.
(9) Measure the absorbance of the organic phase at 400 nm  on aspectrophotom eter.
(10) Retain the organic phase fo r the benzidine-TLC confirm ation,
(c) TLC  Confirmation of Benzidine
(1) The TNB-derivative (chloroform e x tract) is  concentrated by evaporating w ith n itrogen to about 0.2-ml a liq u o t.
(2) Ten m ic ro lite rs of the aliq u o t is  spotted on a s ilic a - g e l T L C  p late th at was activ ated  a t 110 C  for 30 minutes.
(3) The p la te  is  then developed in chloroform-formic acid 90:10, volume to volume (prepared d a ily ) .
(4) The Rf of the unknown amine d eriv a tiv e  is  compared with that of a benzidine spiked d eriv a tiv e , which should always be run as a standard. Benzidine produces a spot on the TLC  p la te  having an Rf = 0.41, v isu alized  by both v is ib le  and U V  lig h t. The spot is  yellow in v is ib le  lig h t and appears as a dark spot under U V  l i g h t .
C alib ratio n  and Standardization
(a) CAUTION: Benzidine is  a known human carcinogen and appropriateprecautions should be u tiliz e d  to minimize exposure. A ll wastes including acetone rinsed d irty  glassware should be co llected  and disposed by approved methods.
50
(b) Prepare a working standard so lu tio n  containing 10 fig of benzidine per ml of methyl alcohol. A  se rie s of benzidine spiked urine samples are prepared from a urine pool sample th a t was previously shown to have less than 100 ng benzidine per 100 ml of u rin e. The spiked urine samples serve as standards and are analyzed by the colorim etric method. The c a lib ra tio n  curve is  estab lish ed  by p lo ttin g  benzidine concentration (ng per 100 ml of urine) vs the absorbance at 400 nm.
C alculations
(a) The concentration of the analyte in the urine sample is  compared with a standard curve prepared w ith benzidine spiked urine samples as described in C alib ratio ns and S tan d ard izatio n . A ll samples are read against a reagent blank as described in  Procedure.
(b) No c o r r e c t io n s  fo r  e x t r a c t io n  e f f i c i e n c y  a re  needed sin c e  
stan dards a re  prepared in  u rin e  and both stan d ard s and sam ples are tre a te d  
the same way.
(c) I f  the calcu lated  concentration exceeds 300 ng/100 ml, the chloroform ex tra c t should be analyzed by TLC  to te n ta tiv e ly  confirm the presence of benzidine.
(d) In th is  lab o rato ry , normal rangds of urine specimens from NIOSH employees not exposed to benzidine or aromatic amines are reported below:
