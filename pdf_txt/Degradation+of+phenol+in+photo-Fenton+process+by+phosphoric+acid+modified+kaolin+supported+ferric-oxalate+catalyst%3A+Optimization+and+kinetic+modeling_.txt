Abstract 
In industrial effluent are common persistent organi c pollutants found that even low concentrations hav e a high 
potential carcinogenic and/or mutagenic, such as ph enol and derivatives thereof, which poses risks to the 
environment. This work has identified and measured through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPL C) 
and its phenol formed as intermediate and also the amount of total organic carbon (TOC). Degradation w as 
evaluated using the same process of photo-Fenton tr eatment (Fe 2+ /H 2O2/UV) applying annular reactor and a 
kinetic study was carried out in terms of TOC. The experimental design was the type central composite.  In the 
process used a photochemical reactor annular counte r optimized in the following conditions: [Fe 2+ ]=14.15 mg L -
1, [H 2O2]=1663.40 mgL -1 at pH 3 for 126.18 minutes, obtaining a mineraliza tion 99.89% TOC and [Fe 2+ ]=15 
mgL -1 [H 2O2]=1800 mgL -1 in 120 minutes a percentage of 100% phenol degrada tion, respectively. The kinetic 
model adopted ( Lumped Kinetic Model ) allowed satisfactory way of representing (R 2=0.9892). The photo-
Fenton process proved to be efficient for degradati on of phenol and intermediates can be incorporated as part of 
the effluent treatment systems, making it an effect ive alternative to the complete degradation of the pollutants 
thereby relieving the impact on water resources and  reducing contamination by-products end of the proc ess.

1. Introduction 
The industrial effluents usually consist of a numbe r of contaminants in varying concentrations which a re 
generally harmful to the environment and living thi ngs (El nahash et al ., 2009). Among those pollutants, 
phenolic compounds pose a threat to the environment  because of its toxicity and stability of bioaccumu lation 
(Teixeira et al ., 2015). They are considered as one of the priorit y pollutants by the Environmental Protection 
Agencies (Wang et al. , 2012 ; Cravotta & Brady, 2015 ). 
Conventional techniques applied for the treatment o f these effluents are mechanical and physico-chemic al 
properties, often associated with biological treatm ent, and may be formed by separation through gravit y, 
centrifugation, application of coagulants, flotatio n, filtration, adsorption with activated carbon and  others (Santo 
et al., 2012). 
These techniques can remove the free and emulsified  oil effluents, suspended solids, and reduce bioche mical 
oxygen demand (BOD), when associated with biologica l treatment. However, when the effluent contains hi ghly 
toxic and recalcitrant constituents, the implementa tion of more advanced techniques are needed to allo w the 
breakdown of these compounds ( Zangeneh  et al.,  2015 ). Among the pollution degradation, mechanisms can be 
pointed out as the advanced oxidation processes (AO P), whose main advantage is the ability to degrade organic 
compounds, leading to reduction or even total miner alization of toxic materials organic loads in waste  water. As 
a result, reduces the emission of pollutants in the  environment or even allowing the reuse of water re covery 
(Giannakis et al ., 2015 ). 
Among some kinds of AOP, the homogeneous photocatal ytic degradation is considered an effective treatme nt, 
including the Fenton oxidation which is based on th e Fenton reaction (hydrogen peroxide and iron salt) , 
(Papoutsakis et al ., 2015 ; Napoleão et al ., 2015 ), which consists of the formation of oxidizing spe cies, capable of 
degrading contaminants in waste water. This techniq ue was used to treat both organic and inorganic com pounds, 
laboratory scale using real effluent samples (Nogue ira et al ., 2007). When a reaction Fenton is irradiated by a  
light source in order to improve the formation of h ydroxyl radicals, this process is called photo-Fent on. 
(Aljuboury et al ., 2015; Alalm et al.,  2015 ). In order to find effective solutions to these en vironmental problems, 
it was also in this work, established methodologies  for the identification, measurement and especially  
degradation by AOP, phenol and its derivatives when  present in aqueous effluents from industries and a nalyzes Chemical and Process Engineering Research                                                                                                                                    www.iiste.org

the behaviors of the important variables that condi tioned these processes. The process was optimized v ia central 
composite design rotation to maximize total organic  carbon conversion (TOC), identifying the best oper ating 
conditions in relation to reaction time and initial  concentrations of H 2O2 and Fe 2+ . 
 
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1 Configuration reactor photochemical for degrada tion phenol  
For the fulfillment of degradation experiments, we used a photochemical reactor, consisting of an oute r glass 
pyrex along the longitudinal axis which comprises o f quartz glass tube. The reactor used is 0.7L capacity, 
coupled to a recirculation tank external to liquid volume 1.6L ( Where the pH of the solution is controlled and the 
hydrogen peroxide is added in equal time intervals ). The total volume of solution to be treated was t herefore 
equal to 2,3L that recirculate at a flow rate of 1. 95 L.min -1. As UV radiation generator, a mercury vapor lamp 
(Philips HPLN) was used with medium pressure, 80W, placed inside the quartz well. The lamp has undergo ne a 
cutting process, where the housing is removed, piec e of glass that protects the bulb. It was coupled t o the reactor 
and the quartz shirts well Quimis, one thermostat b ath to maintain the temperature of the system durin g the 
reaction between 20±1°C and 25±1°C. Monitoring the pH of the reaction medium was done by TECNAL brand 
equipment, TEC -3MP model. The reactor operated batch to recycle, a nd hydrogen peroxide was introduced in 
the middle, continuously, through a peristaltic pum p PROVITEC, PM -5900 model with a flow rate of 1.75 mL 
min -1. Figure 1  displayed a schematic drawing of the reactor annul ar counter used inside a metal box which 
prevents radiation and exposure to external. Each o f the volume of 10 mL at fixed times while each col lected 
sample was then analyzed by HPLC to determine the c oncentration of phenol and a total organic carbon a nalyzer 
for measuring the TOC.

2.2 Degradation of phenol and derivatives by photo -Fenton process  
The photo -Fenton process the following solutions were used: t he solution of the synthetic wastewater was 
prepared with phenol (Dynamics, 99%) with an approx imate concentration of 200 mgL -1, hydrogen peroxide 
(Dynamics, 30%), sulphate iron heptahydrate (FeSO 4.7H 2O) (Nuclear), sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) and sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH) for pH control (2.5 - 3). An inhibitory 0.1M solution (NaOH; KI; Na 2SO 3) was also added to 
complement the iron and inhibit reaction. Every sin gle sample collected was immediately added to the i nhibitor 
solution (15 mL of inhibitor solution to each efflu ent 10mL) and after 5 minutes the vacuum filtration  was 
performed with Millipore membrane 0.22 µm to remove  the iron precipitate.  
 
2.3 Analysis by High -performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  
The quantification and identification of phenol and  its derivatives were performed, using a Shimadzu H PLC 
equipment SS -550, equipped with Ultra C18 reverse phase column ( 5µm, 4.6 x 250 mm) and UV 
spectrophotometric detector (20A SPD). The maximum absorption of phenol, resorcinol, catechol, hydroqu inone 
were recorded at wavelength of 270 nm while the p -benzoquinone and oxalic acids, acetic, malonic, mal eic, Chemical and Process Engineering Research                                                                                                                                    www.iiste.org

succinic and fumaric was 254 nm. All standards were  from Chem Service with purity ≥ 99.5%. We used the 
chromatographic system isocratic mode with a mobile  phase consisting of a water solution acidified wit h 
phosphoric acid 10% (v/v) and methanol in a ratio o f 90:10 isocratic mode. The temperature of the furn ace 
equipment was maintained at 40 ± 1°C, with a flow o f 0.750 mlmin -1 and a pressure 105 kgfcm -2. The 
compounds were identified based on their retention times. 
 
2.4 Analysis by Total organic carbon analysis (TOC)  
For quantitative analysis of aromatics mineralizati on process, we used the TOC analysis using a high s ensitivity 
equipment (4 µgC ·L-1– 25.000 mgC ·L-1), Shimadzu, TOC-VCSH model, capable of quantifying  the levels of 
TOC ; subtracting the total carbon (TC), the inorganic ca rbon (IC). The determination of (CT) was obtained a fter 
the sample injection 680ºC and conducting the same by a flue tube containing platinum supported on alu mina to 
a catalytic oxidation to CO 2. As regards the determination of (IC) after the sa mple is injected, reacted with 
phosphoric acid (H 3PO 4) to 25%, with complete conversion of the IC in CO 2. 
 
2.5 Experimental design     
Selected variables, was held so a factorial design consisting of five levels: -1.68, -1, 0, +1, and +1 .68. As for 3 
variables (n=3) and two levels (low (-1) and high ( +1)), 8 factorial scores (2 3) and axial points 6(2x3) with 3 
center points (rejoinders) amounting 17 experiments , which results in an orthogonal distribution. Table 1  
represented the experimental design with Central Co mposite Design (CCD) applied in the study.

3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Degradation of phenol and intermediates by phot o-Fenton process 
The statistical analysis as well as the calculation s of the effects of the factors and interactions be tween them was 
performed with the Statistical 6.0 program. These a re identified which of the effects (initial concent rations of 
H2O2, Fe 2+  and reaction time) were statistically significant for 95% confidence in the studied levels, as can be  
seen in the charter of Pareto shown in Figure 2a .

The results shown in this Figure refers to TOC conv ersion percentage. It was observed that the concent ration of 
Fe 2+ has greater influence on the photo -Fenton process. It can also be observed in the Pare to diagram interactions 
in the initial concentrations of Fe 2+ /H 2O2 and Fe 2+ /time are relevant in using the proposed technique annular 
bench reactor. This planning was not only observed,  the significance of the H 2O2/time was also taking into 
consideration. By observing up the waste distributi on chart ( Figure 2b ), it was found that the predicted values 
and the observed values were distributed evenly aro und the bend. It was found that the calculated valu es were, 
on average, closer to the red line and the gaps bet ween them were normally distributed, positive and n egative 
deviations were in the same proportion, without a b iased behavior. The Figures 3a and 3b  shows the contour 
and response surface curve, respectively, originate d from the quadratic model, as stated earlier.

It was observed that the concentration of ferrous i ons initially has a positive effect on TOC percenta ge degraded 
to reach the maximum possible level, then going to present a negative result, decreasing the amount of  
conversion of the TOC. This is due to the excessive  increase of the concentration of ferrous ions whic h results in

increased turbidity of the solution conditioning th e action of light and hence the activity of hydroxy l radicals. 
The same can be said in relation to the concentrati on of hydrogen peroxide up to a maximum value, when  it 
begins to decrease with increasing H 2O2 concentration. Excess H 2O2 in the reaction medium favors self-
decomposition reactions, kidnapping the radical hyd roxyl radicals and generating less powerful oxidant , which 
corroborates the results presented by Rodrigues et al . (2007).  In Figure 3c,  it was found that the increase of 
irradiation time also had a positive effect on TOC percentage of degraded until it reaches the maximum  level, 
from which starts to have a negative effect and deg radation. The optimal conditions for the conversion  of the 
TOC were as follows: Concentration of [Fe 2+ ]=14.15 mgL -1, concentration [H 2O2]=1663.40 mgL -1 126.18 and 
reaction time minutes. Under these conditions, it i s expected that TOC conversion percentage equal to 99.72% 
(Figure 3d ), with values that confirm the excellent condition s of the curves above levels. In the Pareto chart, 
corresponding to the phenol degradation illustrated  effect of the initial concentration of H 2O2, Fe 2+  and time 
(Figure 4a ).

 It is seen that the concentration of Fe 2+  has greater influence on the photo-Fenton process.  It can also be 
observed in the Pareto diagram that interacts Fe 2+ /H 2O2 possessed relevance. The significance between the 
Fe 2+ /time and H 2O2/time in this planning just was not observed. The w aste distribution graph ( Figure 4b ), it was 
found that the predicted values and the observed va lues are distributed evenly around the red line, wh ich 
confirms a good fit of the quadratic model. The dif ferences between them are normally distributed, i.e . positive 
and negative deviations are in the same proportion,  without a biased behavior. 
Figures 3e and 3f  demonstrated the response surface and contour curv e originating from the quadratic model, as 
to the phenol degradation. As previously mentioned,  and was to be expected, it observed the same behav ior as 
the increased concentration of ferrous ions. This i nitially had a positive effect on degraded phenol p ercentage 
until a maximum possible level, then moving to pres ent a negative variation, reducing the amount of ph enol. The 
concentration of excess ferrous ion may cause turbi dity that prevents UV absorption causing the recomb ination 
of hydroxyl radicals with iron  (Tokumura et al ., 2008; Moncayo -Lasso et al ., 2008). The optimal conditions for 
the phenol degradation were as follows: concentrati on of [Fe 2+ ] = 15 mg ·L-1, [H 2O2] = 1800 mg ·L-1 and reaction 
time = 120 minutes providing a percentage of 100% p henol degradation.  
3.2 Intermediate formation observed in the photo-Fenton  treatment process 
A major concern of degradation of organic matter by  AOP is the nature and type of oxidation products t hat will 
be generated. Furthermore, in order to establish a secure degradation pathway, it is important to iden tify 
polluting products during their treatment by advanc ed oxidation processes. There is already, today, a set 
described in the literature for information on the mechanism of degradation of phenol by various AOP w here the 
formation of aromatic products of phenolic intermed iates origin, as is the case of dihidroxibenzenos ( catechol 
and hydroquinone) and quinones, has been reported. These aromatic intermediately can undergo the subse quent

aromatic ring cleavage reactions to produce carboxy lic acids such as fumaric acid, muconic acid and ma leic acid, 
and aldehydes. In order to follow the route of degr adation, resulting from the proposed treatment, we tried to 
follow the formation of intermediate oxidation prod ucts, making chromatographic analysis of samples su bjected 
to different treatment conditions. Figure 5 presents the identified intermediate during oxidati on degradation of 
phenol by the photo-Fenton process for treatment pe riods of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. 
 
               Figure 5:  Intermediates observed by applying photo-Fenton tr eatment 
 
 
The best known and which are most frequently cited in the literature products known as dihidroxibenzen os were 
those that appear in greater abundance. When compar ed to these, the highlight was the catechol. In thi s figure, it 
is expected that the ortho-hydroxylation is the pre ferred route for oxidation as resorcinol, hydroquin one and p-
benzoquinone occur in minor amounts. According to t he analysis carried out, it also registers the pres ence of 
malonic acid as main product, maleic, fumaric, succ inic and certain short chain carboxylic acids, such  as acetic 
acid and oxalic acid (kavitha and Palanivelu, 2004) . Furthermore, Zazo et al . (2009) evaluated the formation of 
the intermediate phenol degradation subjected to Fe nton treatment process and verified the presence of  catechol, 
hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone, followed by the fo rmation of maleic, acetic, formic and oxalic acids.  The 
degradation of aromatics, including benzene and phe nol was also studied by Aranda et al.  (2010), using AOP, the 
authors found that the action of •OH hydroxyl radic als on the benzene ring produces phenol, initially forming 
derivatives dihydroxybenzene type and then forming quinones and open chain products such as carboxylic  acids.  
This study verified the presence of the catechol in termediate, hidroquinonal, p-benzoquinone and malon ic, 
succinic, maleic, fumaric and acetic which leads to  suppose that the route of degradation is done in a  similar way 
to that proposed by Aranda et al . (2010). 
 
3.3 Kinetic modeling   
The kinetic model used to represent the catalytic w et oxidation of organic compounds studies was calle d 
Lumped Kinetic Model (LKM) in terms of carbons cont ained in the liquid phase profile describing the to tal 
residual concentration. This can occur by two diffe rent pathways (Iurascu (2009) and Ayodele et al . (2012). 
The reaction pathways may be presented as Figure 6 , where (A) means a group composed of carbon and no n-
refractory intermediates which can be degraded in a  direct manner giving rise to CO 2 and H 2O (C), or A may 
form a carbon refractories group of intermediate co mpounds (B) and these intermediates can be converte d in turn 
into CO 2 and H 2O. The constants k 1, k 2 and k 3 represent the rate constants for each of these rea ctions.

                           Figure 6: Reactions to convert the TOC. 
 
 
The values for the rate constants k 1, k 2 and k 3 were 0.021 min -1, 0.039 min -1 and 0.018 min -1, respectively. It was 
shown that the mineralization of the phenol and non -refractory compounds (A) at the end substrate (C =  CO 2 and 
H2O) occurs at a speed (k 3=0.018 min -1) which is close to the degradation of organics int ermediate (B) (k 1=0.021 
min -1).  
However, concerning the mineralization of refractor y intermediates (B), it is characterized by its spe ed (k 2=0.039 
min -1) increased, compared to the other reactions involv ed in the process.  Figure 7a  shows the values of 
TOC/TOC 0 observed (experimental) and calculated (theoretica l) for the photo-Fenton process. As can be seen 
the values calculated by the proposed kinetic model  are close to those found experimentally.

The Figure 7b  is the correlation between experimental values sub ject to kinetic modeling and predicted values 
in the theoretical model verifying a good fit for a ll the calculated data. The results of this step ki netic study were 
similar to those presented by other authors (Iurasc u et al ., 2009), who found that the phenol / intermediate 
reaction is about three times slower than the react ion intermediates /CO 2+H 2O once k 1 is about two to three 
times lower than k 2. It therefore implies that the degradation of the intermediates was more rapid than the 
conversion of the phenol intermediate degradation p roducts. Once k 3 on the transformation of intermediates into 
final substrate is slower than other reactions, it was concluded that complete oxidation of the organi c pollutants 
CO 2 and H 2O is difficult to achieve since it appears that the  formation of refractory intermediates as is the ca se 
with the short chain carboxylic acids (Luan et al.,  2012). Meanwhile, optimization of the treatment pr ocess was 
applied in a real effluent from a chemical plant co ntaining phenol at a concentration of 312mg L -1 of phenol and 
12000 mgC.L -1 of TOC, respectively. In Figure 8 , the TOC are observed concentration curves in mgC ·L-1 (C TOC ) 
and phenol (Cphenol) in mg.L -1. In terms of percentage conversion, the TOC and ph enol degradation occurred in 
65% and 100%, respectively in 120 minutes of operat ion.

Comparing the conversion result of the actual efflu ent TOC (65%) with the effluent produced in the lab oratory 
(99.72%), a decline was observed .This can be attributed to the effluent having a hig h turbidity, inhibiting the 
passage of light and reducing the efficiency of the  generation of hydroxyl radicals. It was shown that  the photo-
Fenton process achieved an effectiveness for treati ng high organic loads, which implements the biologi cal 
processes, generally slow and loses efficiency by i ncreasing the same. These results show that photo-F enton 
process reactor annular HPLN mercury vapor lamp wit h 80W power efficiency showed 65% of the total 
mineralization of TOC degradation of phenol. Hence,  it presents perspective use in treating real efflu ent industry 
sandpaper or a related field in the absence of sola r radiation in rainy or nighttime. 
5. Conclusion 
The photo-Fenton technique (Fe 2+ /H 2O2/UV) applied attested to be effective for the degra dation of phenol 
and a lower TOC conversion of the remaining reactio n time. With the application of central composite 
design, there were optimized reaction conditions, o btaining the optimal point on the proportions of ca talyst 
concentration (Fe 2+ ) = 14.15 mg ·L-1, H 2O2=1663.40 mg ·L-1 and the weather (126.18 minutes). Under these 
conditions, the conversion of TOC obtained was equa l to 99.71% in 120 minutes of operation and 99.98% 
of phenol degradation. In testing conducted real ef fluent resulting from an abrasive industry, phenol 
concentration equals to 370 mgL -1 and 12000 mgL-1 · TOC using enhanced proportion to the concentration s 
of the variables involved and time 65% was obtained  TOC conversion occurs almost complete degradation 
(99.80%) of the phenol. Hydrogen peroxide concentra tions were added to the system consumed during the 
process, leaving little or no concentration thereof . The continuation of this research is relevant for  the 
development of systems on an industrial scale. It i s recommended to apply the used technique 
(photoFenton) as treatment of wastewater containing  phenolics compounds.
