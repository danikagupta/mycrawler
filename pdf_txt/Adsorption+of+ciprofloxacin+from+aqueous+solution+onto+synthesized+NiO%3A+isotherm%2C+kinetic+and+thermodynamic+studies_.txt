abstract
In the present study, the adsorption behavior of ciprofloxacin (CIP) from aqueous solution, using 
NiO nanoparticles (synthesized by the sol–gel method) was studied at batch experiments. A num-
ber of parameters (e.g., temperature, adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH, and initial CIP concentra-tions) were studied. The best efficiency for the removal of CIP was obtained by 99.2%. The optimal 
parameters used here were the temperature of 50°C, synthesized NiO dosage of 1 g/L, concentration 
10 mg/L at contact time 90 min, and pH = 3. In order to study the kinetics of adsorbent, the pseudo-  
first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion models were applied. According to the pre-determined correlation coefficients (R
2), the pseudo-second-order kinetic model showed 
a better correlation between the kinetic behaviors of the adsorbent. Thermodynamic experiments showed that the CIP adsorption was endothermic. The negative values of ΔG ° indicate the sponta-
neous nature of the adsorption. The increased randomness was attributed to the adsorption process based on the positive entropy change. The equilibrium data were tested with Langmuir, Freundlich, 
Redlich–Peterson, Dubinin–Radushkevich, and Temkin isotherm at four different temperatures and it was observed that the Langmuir isotherm was best ﬁtted in the adsorption of CIP.

1. Introduction
Due to the rapid growth of the population, the demand 
for freshwater is becoming limited and increasing the 
scarcity day by day [1,2]. The toxicity of chemicals that may cause adverse effects for human health and that has become a critical concern [3,4].
Antibiotics as one of the most important groups of phar -
maceutical compounds that are extensively used for the prevention or treatment of diseases [5].In general, antibiotics are released to water bodies 
through two main paths: (i) excretion of antibiotics un- metabolized portion from human and animal bodies through feces or urine and (ii) antibiotics direct disposal as waste. Because only partial removal of these compounds can take place in wastewater treatment plants, the treated outlet effluents from these systems still contain amounts of antibi-otics [6,7]. For instance, antibiotics in drinking water result in unknown health effects by chronic low-level exposure if antibiotics are not removed during the process of water 391 D. Balarak et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 212 (2021) 390–400
purification and exist in the drinking water of consumers 
[8]. Furthermore, antibiotics can be a reason for bad odors 
and skin problems and may lead to the microbial resistance 
against pathogens or the extinction of organisms that are 
available during the water treatment process [9].
Ciprofloxacin (CIP) (Fig. 1), a common human and 
veterinary fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been used for 
decades to prevent human and animal infections [9,10]. CIP 
enters into the water column through incomplete metabo-
lism from the human body and/or by wastewater discharged from pharmaceutical companies. Thus, CIP can exist in 
waters at hundreds of ng/L to μg/L levels. The pKa values 
for CIP are 5.90 ± 0.15 and 8.89 ± 0.11 for the carboxylic acid 
group and the basic-N-moiety, respectively; therefore, it is formed as a cation, zwitterion and anion in soils and waters (Fig. 2) [11,12].
Thus, the wastewater from drug manufacturing plants 
should be considered as a significant risk, and technology 
to eliminate the risk of antibiotics should be applied to 
save humans and environments [13]. Recently, many meth-ods had been tried to remove the antibiotics that appeared 
in the other environment [14]. These include coagulation 
and sedimentation, biodegradation, photo-transformation, 
electrochemical, chlorination, ozonation, and nanofiltra-tion through membranes [15,16]. These methods effectively removed antibiotics but were less popular due to their high 
cost and complexity [17,18]. Besides these methods, adsorp-
tion has been proven to be an effective method due to its good application to high concentrations of the adsorbed 
materials and also for its high removal and low cost [19,20].
Nanotechnology and nanomaterials are innovative mate-
rials for removing contaminants [21,22]. In many studies, 
nanoparticles have been considered to eliminate contam-inants such as organic matters. Other studies also have 
reported that nanoparticles had remarkable efficiencies in 
removing pollutants [23,24].
Not only due to the very low usage and low doses 
of nickel oxide nanoparticles for water and wastewater treatment but also due to recycling and reuse of nanopar -
ticles for several consecutive cycles, which has been suc-cessful according to previous studies, this nanoparticle will 
not have any environmental problems.
In this study, the sol–gel method was used for synthe-
sizing NiO. It is the most commonly used technique for 
the preparation of bulk nanomaterial of metal oxides [21]. 
The method is useful to perform completely controlled 
reaction by the diffusion of ionic species or atomic species 
of reactants and products [22]. It requires high temperature and small particle size to bring the reaction partners to close 
sufficiently. If this method of synthesis is compared with 
organic chemistry where highly sophisticated synthetic 
routes are required, this method is crude in nature [22].
In this study, synthesized NiO nanoparticle was con-
sidered as an effective adsorbent for removing CIP from 
aqueous solution. The impacts of five parameters, includ-
ing adsorbent dosage, pH, temperature, and adsorption 
time and initial concentration were scrutinized on the efficiency of CIP adsorption. Also, kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics of CIP adsorption on synthesized 
NiO nanoparticles were studied.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
NHCl
2·6H2O (CAS Number 7718-54-9), sulfuric acid 
(98%), sodium hydroxide (CAS Number: 1310-73-2), ethanol 
(96%), and hydrochloric acid (37%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).
Ciprofloxacin (CIP), (C
17H18FN3O3·HCl, purity > 98%) 
with a molecular weight of 696.6 g/mol, was obtained from 
 Fig. 1. Structure of ciprofloxacin.

Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and applied in the experiment without 
further purification. The molecular structure of CIP is given in Fig. 1. A stock solution containing 1,000 mg/L was pre-
pared by dissolving 1 g of analytical grade CIP with distilled 
water in a 1 L standard flask. This was made to mark with dis-
tilled water. Standard solutions of different concentrations, as might be required, were later prepared from this stock.
2.2. Preparation of NiO nanoparticles
The nano nickel(II) oxide (NiO) was prepared using 
the sol–gel process [24]. Fig. 3 shows the preparation of 
the adsorbent by the sol–gel method. First of all, 1.5 g 
(0.0063 mol) NHCl
2·6H2O was transferred to a 250 mL round 
bottom flask at room temperature and dissolved in 70 mL of 
absolute ethanol. The solution was subjected to continuous stirring. In another beaker 0.5 g (0.0125 mol) NaOH was dis-
solved in 100 mL absolute ethanol. This solution was added 
to NiCl
2·6H2O solution dropwise. The light green colored gel 
was made after the mixture was stirred for 2 h. After 2 h, the 
gel was filtered and washed with distilled water and then finally with ethanol. The light green colored precipitate was formed. The precipitate was oven-dried at 100°C for 4 h. 
The fine green powder was subjected to calcination at 290°C for 30 min. Black colored nano powder of NiO was prepared.
In the present study, to determine the shape, size, and 
morphology of the synthesized NiO nanoparticle, trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM, LEO 912 AB-100 KV, ZEISS, Germany) was used in 100 kV, and scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM, Mira 3 XMU, TESCAN, Czech Republic). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer (FTIR, Nicollet AVATAR 5700, THERMO, USA) was also used in the range of 400–4,000 cm
−1 by apply ing the KBr 
pellet method. The surface area analyzer (Quantachrome Corporation, USA) was used to analyze the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porous properties, and N
2 as the adsorbate at 77 K.
2.3. Batch adsorption test
The adsorption experiment was carried out as a batch 
inside 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL of 
synthetic CIP solution. The initial pH of the samples was set by 0.1 mol NaOH and HCl in the fixed value of 3. Afterward, 1  g/L 
of adsorbent were added up to the solutions with CIP ini-tial concentration of 25 mg/L. The final solution was stirred 
at 30°C and 120 rpm for 90 min. The solutes were filtered 
through filter paper and 5 mL of the solution was analyzed 
to measure adsorbed CIP concentration. The optimization process is repeated for other parameters. These param-eters were adsorbent dosage (0.1–1.5 g/L), temperature 
(20°C–50°C), contact time (10–150 min), pH of aqueous solu-
tion (3–11), and initial concentration of CIP (10–100 mg/L). 
The temperature of the solution was adjusted to optimum condition and one of the parameters was considered as a variable while others were constant. The optimized con-dition of each parameter was selected and the investiga-tion continued to define the optimum condition of other parameters. The CIP concentration was identified by high- performance liquid chromatography (C18 ODS column) with a UV detector 2006 at a wavelength of 277 nm. The mobile 
phase was 0.05 M phosphoric acid/acetonitrile with a volu-
metric ratio of 87/13 with an injection flow rate of 1 mL/min.
The amount of adsorbed ions by synthesized NiO 
for each gram of adsorbent is identified by Eq. (1) [25]:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characteristics of synthesized NiO nanoparticle
At high magnification (50,000×), the nano NiO in 
the SEM image showed a spherical nanoparticle struc-
ture (Fig. 4a). Also, the typical TEM image of nano NiO is 
shown in Fig. 4b. There is a good agreement between the 
TEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results for the particle size. The average size of nano NiO, as measured by TEM, was found lower than 10 nm.
The XRD pattern of the prepared nanoparticles (Fig. 5) 
clearly showed the characteristic peaks of cubic NiO, which were consistent with the standard peaks of NiO (JCPDS 
card number 04-0835). No characteristic peaks of impurities 
were detected, indicating the high purity of the prepared 
adsorbent.
The XRD pattern of NiO nanoparticles shows five pri-
mary peaks at 2θ = 37°, 43°, 63°, 75°, and 79°. As seen in Fig. 5, 
the diffraction peaks are broader and have weak intensity 
due to the small size of particles. The crystallite size of NiO 
nanoparticles was estimated by Debye–Scherrer equation 
by using Eq. (3) [27]:
DK=λ
βθcos2 (3)
The average crystallite size of synthesized NiO nano-
particles was about 9 nm.The BET plot of nitrogen adsorption onto synthesized 
NiO nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 6. The specific surface 
area and total pore volume of synthesized NiO nanoparticles 
were 121.2 mg/g and 0.187 cm3/g, respectively.
The adsorption capacity obtained from this study by the 
cell–gel method (121.2 mg/g) is higher than the adsorption 
capacity obtained by the precipitation method (71.09 mg/g) 
and therefore one of the advantages of this method is its high adsorption capacity compared to similar methods [28].
FT-IR spectroscopy is a useful tool to understand the 
functional group of any organic molecule. FT-IR spectra of 
synthesized NiO nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 7. Metal 
oxides generally give absorption bands below 1,000 cm
–1 
arising from inter-atomic vibrations. The peak at 443 cm–1 
in the spectrum, showing Ni–O bond, gave clear evidence 
about the presence of the crystalline NiO [27]. The peaks at 3,465; 1,845; and 1,386 cm
–1 exist, which are attributed to 
the adsorbed water on the products of the NiO nanopar -
ticles. The wideband at 3,465 cm–1 is mainly the stretching 
vibration mode O–H group and the peak at 1,621 cm–1 is the 
O–H bending band on the surface of the products, which are associated with the adsorbed water on the products [26].

3.2. Effect of synthesized NiO mass
Fig. 8 presents the result of the influence of adsorbent 
mass on the adsorption capacity and percentage removal 
of CIP. This figure reveals that adsorption efficiency was increased with the increase in the mass of the synthesized NiO nanoparticle dose up to a maximum (almost 99.2% adsorption) when the mass of the NiO dose was 1 g/L. The 
increase in the percentage of CIP removal with adsorbent dose could be attributed to an increase in the number of 
adsorption sites associated with an increase in the mass of 
the adsorbent and thus directly increase the surface area, 
as already reported in the literature [27,28]. Conversely, the adsorption capacity of the synthesized NiO decreased grad-ually from 93.1 to 16.5 mg/g when the mass of synthesized 
NiO dose was increased from 0.1 to 1.5 g. This observation 
can be linked to the concentration gradient [29,30].
By increasing the dosage of adsorbent, the adsorption 
sites of adsorbent could not be full-scaled used and made some adsorption sites approached, so that the adsorp-
tion capacity of per unit of adsorbent gradually reduced. In general, the surface area and available sites are usually 
related to the amount of adsorbent [24].
3.3. Effect of pH on the removal of CIP
In order to study the effect of pH on CIP adsorption, 
25 mg/L CIP solution was shaken with 1 g/L synthesized 
NiO and equilibrated for 90 min at pH values ranging 
from 3.0 to 11.0. Comparing the removal efficiency at dif-
ferent pH, the adsorbed CIP decreased with increasing 
pH (Fig. 9). CIP pKa values were 6.1 and 8.7 for the car -
boxylic acid group and amine group on the piperazine moiety, respectively [11]. When the pH of the solution is 
below 6.1, CIP is mainly present as a cation, but CIP exists 
in zwitterionic form when pH ranges from 6.1 to 8.7. If 
the pH of the solution is above 8.7, CIP loses protons from 
the carboxylic group and is mainly in anion form [9,10]. 
When the pH was lower than 6, removal of CIP increased 
because of improved electrostatic attraction which results 
from the opposite charge between the CIP and synthesized 
NiO nanoparticles. In contrast, at high pH, CIP removal 
was significantly reduced. This may be due to the zwitte-
rionic nature of CIP. In acidic solutions, ionic interactions 
between CIP and the adsorbent surface occur, which causes 
high removal efficiencies [12,13].
3.4. Effect of contact time and initial concentration of CIP
The result of contact time on the removal of CIP by syn-
thesized NiO is presented in Fig. 10. The result shows that 
the rate of CIP removal occurred rapidly within the first 30 min of the adsorption and therefore proceeded to an 
equilibrium state with the maximum percentage removal of 99.2%. This indicates that most of the adsorption occurs on the surface rather than the pores of the synthesized NiO nanoparticle [30,31]. This further confirms that the adsorp-tion of CIP by synthesized NiO was physical in nature [32].
Also as shown in Fig. 10 the adsorption rate was rap-
idly increasing at the beginning of the adsorption process and gradually decreased with the lengthen of contact time until adsorption equilibrium. This was because the mass concentration of the CIP in the solution was high at the

beginning time, and there were a large amount of available 
adsorption sites of synthesized NiO. As the adsorption pro-ceeding, the decreasing adsorption rate gradually decreased due to the adsorption sites were gradually occupied by CIP ions [31].
The effect of the initial concentration of the CIP on 
adsorption amounts depends on the synthesized NiO nanoparticles which were investigated by changing the concentrations in aqueous solution in the range of 10–100 mg/L. Fig. 11 shows the effect of the initial concentra-tions of CIP on adsorption capacities. As observed in the graphs, the amount of CIP adsorbed by the synthesized NiO nanoparticles that were increased with the increasing CIP concentration. This may be because the amount of CIP ions obtainable for adsorption increases with the increase in initial concentrations [33].
3.5. Kinetic studies
Pseudo-ﬁrst-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparti-
cle diffusion models have been used for kinetic data in dif-
ferent systems. The pseudo-ﬁrst-order equation is expressed 
as following [33,34]:logl og qq qtK
et e−() − =1
2303. (4)
where qt (mg CIP/g adsorbent) is the amount of adsorbed 
solute, qe (mg CIP/g adsorbent) is CIP concentrations at 
equilibrium, K1 (min–1) is the pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate con-
stant and t  (min) is time. The qe and K1 can be obtained by 
linear regression. That is, a linear regression line is formed by plotting log(q
e – qt) vs. t, where K1 and qe are the slope 
and intercept of the line, respectively.
K1 is used to determine the rate of equilibrium in the 
system and is both ways dependent and independent of the conditioned systems. That is, K
1 is a combination of adsorp-
tion and desorption rate constants and is not the intrinsic adsorption rate constant.
The most commonly used pseudo-second-order 
equation in the form of Eq. (5) [35,36]:
t
qht
qte=+1 (5)
where h = K2qe2 can be regarded as the initial adsorption rate 
when t → 0 and K2 (g adsorbent/mg CIP min) is a constant 
which is strongly dependent on the applied operating con-ditions. For instance, K
2 is highly dependent on initial solute 
concentrations. The pseudo-second-order model includes the presumption that the rate-limiting step refers to chem-ical adsorption which occurs by sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and adsorbate. It is presumed that the adsorption capacity increases in the proportion to the number of active sites of the adsorbed materials.
The intraparticle diffusion model is expressed as 
(Eq. (6)) [37]:
qK tItd=+ 05. (6)
where Kd (mg/g min0.5) is the rate constant for intraparticle 
diffusion and I represent the thickness of the boundary layer. The values of K
d and I correspond to the slope and inter -
cept of the plot of qt vs. t0.5, which indicates a multilinearity,  00.10.20.30.40.5

suggesting that the adsorption processes include multi-
ple steps. Solute adsorption by porous adsorbents consists of three consecutive steps. The first step means external or improvisational adsorption. The second step refers to the gradual adsorption that occurs when intraparticle diffu-sion is rate-limiting. The last step is the final equilibrium stage when intraparticle diffusion slows down due to a markedly lower adsorbate concentration. The intraparticle diffusion is the rate-limiting step when the regression line passes through the origin. In contrast, when the regression line does not go by origin, besides intraparticle diffusion, other processes can control the adsorption efficiency [38].
The K
d values increased with increasing initial concen-
tration (Table 1), suggesting a greater driving force as the 
initial concentration increased.
Table 1 indicates that the calculated qe of the pseudo-  
second-order model was more similar to the value obtained 
from the actual experiment than the calculated qe of the 
pseudo-first-order model. In addition, R2 values of the 
pseudo- second-order model (Fig. 12) were higher than those 
of the pseudo-first-order model. Thus, the pseudo-second-  
order model ﬁts better than the pseudo-first-order model. The reaction may not be a pseudo-first-order reaction despite a high correlation coefficient if the experimental q
e is not equal to the intercept. For this adsorbent, experi-
mental data was not ﬁt to pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetic due to q
e,cal values calculated by pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetic are not 
equal to qe,exp. Generally, the rate constant (K2) decreases 
for larger concentrations due to the limited adsorption sites on synthesized NiO nanoparticle, and when the initial con-centration is an increase from 10 to 100 mg/L, K
2 value is 
decreased from 0.0089 to 0.0012 (g/mg min).
As shown in Fig. 13, the plots showed multi-linear, 
suggesting that there were two or more steps while the adsorption process occurred. The ﬁrst stage occurred from 0 to 30 min and represented the transport of CIP mole-
cules from the external surface of the adsorbents to the internal pores of the adsorbents. The second linear portion included the adsorption period from 30–60 min, which 
represents intraparticle diffusion. The third stage took place between 60 and 90 min and adsorption of CIP mole-
cules occurred on the interior surface of the adsorbent. The third stage reflected a very low slope due to the decrease in CIP concentrations and available active sites [39]. This means the equilibrium adsorption is almost reached.
3.6. Adsorption thermodynamics
Adsorption of CIP onto synthesized NiO nanoparticles 
can be influenced by temperature; thus, adsorption exper -
iments were conducted at various temperatures (20°C, 
30°C, 40°C, and 50°C). The removal efficiency increased from 86.4% to 99.2% with increasing temperature. This is because of an increase in the number of sorption sites which results from a breakdown of some internal bond of the active surface of the adsorbent [31]. Thermodynamic parameters were estimated to study the thermodynamic properties of CIP adsorption. Also, the relationship

between the CIP distribution coefﬁcient (Ke) and free energy 
(ΔG° kJ/mol) of adsorption (Eq. (7)) is [40,41]:
∆GR TKe°=−  ln (7)
The equilibrium constant Ke was calculated from the 
concentration of CIP adsorbed at equilibrium (C0 – Ce) 
and equilibrium concentration (Ce) of the CIP in the liquid 
phase using the following equation [34]:
KCC

e=−()0 (8)
The van’t Hoff Eqs. (9) and (10) was employed to com -
pute the values ΔH° and ΔS° from the equilibrium constant 
as shown [37,38]:

where ΔH ° is the enthalpy change, ΔS ° is the entropy change, 
t is the temperature in Kelvin and R is the gas constant (kJ/
mol K). Table 2 indicates the thermodynamic parameters 
obtained from experimental data. The negative value of 
ΔG° means that Gibb’s free energy decreases, suggesting that the adsorption processes are feasible and spontaneous [32]. The positive value of ΔH° suggests the endother -
mic nature of adsorption [35]. Based on the positive value of ΔS°, we concluded that some structural changes occur on the adsorbent and the randomness increased at solid/liquid interface [37].
3.7. Adsorption isotherms
Adsorption isotherms can depict the interaction between 
adsorbate and adsorbent. Langmuir adsorption isotherm is 
known to model a single coating layer on surface adsorp-
tion. Furthermore, the surface of the adsorbent is homo-
geneous; as a result, adsorption energy is the same on all active sites. Langmuir isotherm is expressed following [42]:
C
qq KC
qe
eme
m=+1 (11)where qm is the monolayer capacity, K is the equilibrium 
constant. These constants can be determined from the intercept and the slope of the linear plot of experimen-tal data of C
e/qe vs. Ce. Another effective parameter in the 
Langmuir equation is RL that describes the properties of the 
equation. The value of RL is the representative of the state 
and quality of the adsorption isotherm model. If RL > 1, 
RL = 0, RL = 1 and 0 < RL < 1, the process is non-desired, 
irreversible, linear and desirable, respectively. The value 
of RL is identified using Eq. (12) [43].

Freundlich isotherm is used for modeling the adsorp-
tion which occurs on heterogeneous surfaces. The linear 
expression of Freundlich isotherm is given by Eq. (13) [44]:
logl og qKnCeF e=+log1 (13)
where KF is the constant indicating adsorption capacity 
of the adsorbent, and n represents the constant related to 
the adsorption intensity. KF and n were estimated from the 
slope and intercept of the plot of logqe vs. logCe. The plot 
of logqe vs. logCe can give linear regression with slope and 
intercept, corresponding to KF and n, respectively. Values of 
n > 1 indicate favorable adsorption as a physical process. 
When n is equal to 1, adsorption is linear, but adsorption 
is a chemical process when n  is below 1.
Temkin isotherm has one factor which shown the inter -
action between adsorbent and adsorbing particle so vividly. This model was applied in forms, given as Eq. (14) [45]:
qB KB CeT e=+  ln ln  (14)
where B is Temkin constant which is related to the heat of 
sorption (J/mol) and KT is Temkin isotherm constant (L/g). 
Plotting of qe vs. ln(Ce) gives a linear line of slope RT/b and 
intercept (RT lnKT)/b.
Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model is an 
empirical model that is applied to represent the adsorption processed with Gaussian energy distribution onto heteroge-neous surfaces. This isotherm applies only when adsorbate concentrations are moderate, and is expressed as follows [46]:
logl n qqem=− βε2 (15)
where qe is the amount of adsorbate in the adsorbent at 
equilibrium (mg/g), qm is theoretical isotherm saturation 
capacity (mg/g), β is D-R isotherm constant (mol2/kJ2).  
ε = D-R isotherm constant. This approach was used to dis-
tinguish the physical and chemical adsorption of metals with its free energy (E), which can be computed by the relationship [47]:

where R = the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K); T = absolute

The Redlich–Peterson (R-P) isotherm model is applied 
to indicate adsorption equilibrium for a wide concen-
tration range, and is suitable for either homogeneous or heterogeneous systems.
It can be described by Eq. (18) [48]:

The Langmuir, Freundlich, R-P, Temkin, D-R and R-P 
isotherm parameters were determined through the lin-
earized form and their values, along with the respective correlation coefficients, and are listed in Table 3. This table shows that the best correlation coefficients were, in decreas-ing order, Langmuir > R-P > Temkin > D-R > Freundlich 
models. Table 3 also shows that q
m values of the Langmuir 
and D-R isotherm models increased with increasing at temperature. Also, Table 3 shows that energy values of CIP sorption increased from 2.75 to 9.65 kJ/mol with a tempera-
ture increase from 293 to 323 K and indicate that physisorp-
tion played a significant role in the adsorption process at low temperatures [45]. Values of R
L were observed to be 
between 0 and 1 in this study (Table 3); thus, the adsorption was fairly favorable and the adsorbent used in this study had good potential for CIP removal.
Table 4 shows a comparison of the adsorption capac-
ity (q
e) of different materials reported in the literatures as 
adsorbent for CIP adsorption from aqueous solution under different experimental conditions. The results demon-strated that the synthesized NiO can be a promising material for removal of CIP from pharmaceutical wastewater.
4. Conclusion
In this study, we have studied the removal of CIP 
from aqueous solution using synthesized NiO over a wide range of concentrations. The influence of several factors 
(e.g., temperature, adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH, and initial CIP concentrations) on the removal of CIP by syn-thesized NiO were tested. The following conclusions are made based on the results of the present study:
• Thermodynamic parameters indicated that CIP adsorp-
tion was endothermic adsorption. The negative values of ΔG° indicated the spontaneous nature of the adsorption.
• Adsorption of CIP increased with contact time and adsorbent dose at a certain limit.
• Optimum pH was shown to be 3.0 with the removal rate reaching 99.2%.
