No field of research has embraced and applied genomic technology more than the field of microbiology.
Comparative analysis of nearly 300 microbial species has demonstrated that the microbial genome is a dynamicentity shaped by multiple forces. Microbial genomics has provided a foundation for a broad range of applications,from understanding basic biological processes, host–pathogen interactions, and protein–protein interactions, todiscovering DNA variations that can be used in genotyping or forensic analyses, the design of novel antimicrobialcompounds and vaccines, and the engineering of microbes for industrial applications. Most recently, metagenomicsapproaches are allowing us to begin to probe complex microbial communities for the first time, and they hold greatpromise in helping to unravel the relationships between microbial species.
During the past 10 years, genomics-based approaches have had a
profound impact on the field of microbiology and our under-standing of microbial species. Since the first report on the com-plete genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae in 1995
(Fleischmann et al. 1995), nearly 300 other prokaryotic genomesequences have been completed (http://www.genomesonline.org/; http://cmr.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi),with another 750 projects underway. In the early days of micro-bial genomics, our ignorance about the extent of species diversitywas reflected in the assumption that the complete sequence of20–30 carefully chosen representatives of the bacterial and ar-chaeal domains of life would provide a sufficient amount of in-formation for follow-up investigations. As sequence data beganto accumulate, it quickly became clear that we had underesti-mated the wealth of genetic and biochemical diversity in theprokaryotic world. Indeed, the completion of the sequence ofEscherichia coli O157:H7 by Perna and colleagues in 2001 revealed
that this new isolate contained more than 1300 strain-specificgenes as compared with E. coli K-12. These genes encode proteins
involved in virulence and expanded metabolic capabilities, aswell as several prophages. This was a striking example of the factthat two members of the same species could differ in gene con-tent by almost 30%. Today, many genomics efforts are focusedon sequencing multiple isolates and strains and providing newinsights into species diversity and the dynamic nature of theprokaryotic genome.
Because of their larger genome sizes, genome sequencing
efforts on fungi and unicellular eukaryotes were slower to getstarted than projects focused on prokaryotes; however, todaythere are a number of genome sequences available from both ofthese groups of organisms that have led to significant improve-ments in overall sequence annotation and also shed considerablelight on novel aspects of their biology (see Dolinski and Botstein2005; Galagan et al. 2005).
A changing view of the microbial world
The microbial world can be classified into four groups that differin many aspects of their biology: Bacteria and Archaea, whichrepresent the prokaryotes, single-celled Eukarya, and viruses.During the past 10 years, a large and phylogenetically diversenumber of microbial species has been targeted for genome analy-sis. Extremes in genome size (<500 kb to almost 10 Mbp) andgene content have also been revealed by these studies, with noabsolute boundaries between viral, bacterial, archaeal, fungal,and protist genomes (Fig. 1).
When one considers the more than 20-fold difference in
bacterial genome size (Fig. 1), a question that emerged is wheth-er or not one can define a minimal set of genes essential forlife. The notion of a minimal genome has been explored througha number of both experimental (Hutchison III et al. 1999;Sassetti et al. 2003; Krause and Balish 2004) and theoretical(Koonin 2003; Klasson and Andersson 2004) approaches. Oneof the first studies employed transposon mutagenesis in theminimal organisms Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, based on the assumption that there would be a lim-ited number of genes encoding proteins with redundant func-tions, thereby making it easier to identify essential versus non-essential genes. The results of this study suggested that as manyas 130 of the 480 predicted coding sequences may not beessential in vitro (Hutchison III et al. 1999). However, one limi-tation of the transposon approach is that the mutants that aregenerated contain disruptions only in single genes. To date, therehas been no experimental validation that a minimal genomecontaining 350 functional genes would support life. Indeed, suc-cessive rounds of M. genitalium mutagenesis revealed that fitness
of the cultures is gradually reduced (Peterson and Fraser 2001).While it might be possible to compensate for reduced fitnessthrough gene loss by supplementation of the growth medium,this notion points out the intricate relationship between thedefinition of a minimal genome and the cellular environment.More recently, new methods have been described for the deletionof large, non-essential regions of the E. coli genome (Kolis-
nychenko et al. 2002; Goryshin et al. 2003; Hashimoto et al.2005) and are allowing for correlations between genotype andphenotype. While these techniques show great promise forengineering reduced bacterial genomes, other new approachesfor generating 5- to 6-kb segments of DNA from oligonucleotides(Smith et al. 2003) and for microchip-based multiplex genesynthesis (Tian et al. 2004) represent a significant step towardan era of synthetic biology that will also enable some of the

Multiple forces are shaping microbial genomes
Comparative genomics approaches have revealed that the pro-karyotic genome is a dynamic entity, different in many respectsfrom more stable multicellular eukaryotic genomes. Multipleforces have shaped the prokaryotic genome during its evolution;these include gene loss/genome reduction, genome rearrange-ment, expansion of functional capabilities through gene dupli-cation, and acquisition of functional capabilities through lateralgene transfer (Fig. 2).
Genome projects on various obligate intracellular patho-
gens and endosymbionts have provided several windows on theprocess of reductive evolution (Andersson and Kurland 1998;Moran and Plague 2004). Although these organisms are similar inthat they contain significantly reduced genomes (/H113491 Mbp) thatare missing one or more key metabolic pathways, thereby mak-ing them dependent on their hosts for survival, it is clear thatthere are multiple solutions to a minimal genome. Evidence hassuggested that the transition to obligate intracellular species of-ten involves deletions of large segments of DNA early on in theprocess, likely catalyzed by genome instability mediated by in-sertion sequence (IS) elements or other mobile DNA that areeventually lost from the genomes (Moran and Mira 2001; Moranand Plague 2004; Belda et al. 2005; see also the example belowfrom comparative analysis of Burkholderia spp). While it was ini-
tially thought that genes targeted for loss during this processwere ones that were no longer necessary for survival in a hostenvironment, there are increasing numbers of examples fromcomparative genomics projects that suggest some gene loss maybe beneficial to the microbe. This is truein the case of certain pathogens, includ-ingMycobacterium tuberculosis (Tsolaki et
al. 2004), which has lost metabolic path-ways and become more virulent, andShigella (Nakata et al. 1993) and Borde-
tella pertussis (Parkhill et al. 2003), which
have lost genes encoding cell surface an-tigens, a situation that may allow for en-hanced ability to evade the host im-mune system.
Genome rearrangements mediated
by IS elements can also play a major rolein genome plasticity. The extent of suchrearrangements often reflects the life-style of the organism. In general, obli-gate intracellular organisms that exist inrelative isolation contain few mobile el-ements, and their genomes tend to bestable over long periods of time. At theother extreme, free-living bacteria oftencontain large numbers of IS elementsand repetitive DNA sequences that maymediate homologous recombination.One example of the role of IS elementsin mediating genome-wide rearrange-ments comes from the comparativeanalysis of Burkholderia mallei (Nierman
et al. 2004), an obligate mammalianpathogen that causes glanders, and Burk-
holderia pseudomallei (Holden et al.
2004), an environmental soil-dwelling organism. The B. mallei
genome contains 171 complete or partial IS elements that col-lectively represent >3% of the sequence (Nierman et al. 2004).TheB. mallei genome is 1.4 Mb smaller than that of its closest
relative, B. pseudomallei, and most of the synteny break points
between the two genomes are bounded by IS elements. In addi-tion, two syntenic portions of chromosome 1 in B. pseudomallei
that are found on chromosome 2 in B. mallei are flanked by IS
elements, lending further support to the idea that genome rear-rangement can play a large role in genome structural alterationin certain species (Nierman et al. 2004).
Gene duplication and functional diversification is yet an-
other mechanism for generating diversity within microbial ge-nomes. Gene paralogs (genes related by duplication) can repre-sent as much as 50% of the larger microbial genomes, and aninteresting subset of such genes are lineage-specific duplicationsthat presumably are responsible, in part, for species-specific bi-ology. A recent analysis of 115 completed prokaryotic genomesequences by Konstantinidis and Tiedje (2004) using the Clustersof Orthologous Groups (COGs) database (Tatusov et al. 2003)revealed that larger genomes are disproportionately enriched ingenes encoding proteins involved in regulation, secondary me-tabolism, and transport. The inverse correlation was observedwith proteins involved in translation and DNA processing. Thisanalysis provides a possible explanation for why species withlarger genomes are more apt to dominate environments wherenutrients are scare, because they are more versatile in terms oftheir ability to sense and respond to changing environmentalconditions.
Another source of genome variability that plays an impor-
tant role in prokaryotic genome evolution is lateral gene transfer

means for rapid adaptations to changing demands on an organ-ism (Boucher et al. 2003). For example, acquisition of virulencedeterminants on pathogenicity islands appears to play a majorrole in pathogen evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of multiplestrains of Staphylococcus aureus indicated that the diversification
of the highly variable RD13 region, encoding putative pathogen-esis-related proteins, has likely occurred by LGT and recombina-tion (Fitzgerald et al. 2003). Comparative analysis between S.
aureus and its close relative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, demon-
strated that genome islands in non-syntenic regions of the ge-nome, likely acquired by LGT, are the primary source of varia-tions in pathogenicity and virulence between these species (Gillet al. 2005). The acquisition of a circular plasmid with 99.6%similarity with the Bacillus anthracis toxin-encoding plasmid,
pXO1, by Bacillus cereus G9241 was likely responsible for the
emergence of a strain of B. cereus able to cause a disease resem-
bling inhalation anthrax (Hoffmaster et al. 2004). Although ho-mologs of the B. anthracis pXO2-encoded capsule genes were not
found in this strain of B. cereus, a polysaccharide capsule cluster
encoded on a second, previously unidentified plasmid, pBC218,was identified. The virulence of this stain was confirmed in anA/J mouse model of anthrax. LGT probably also plays an impor-tant role in generating diversity among environmental bacteria.Several lines of evidence have suggested extensive LGT from ar-chaeal species to the hyperthermophilic bacteria, Thermotoga
maritima (Nelson et al. 1999; Nesbo et al. 2002; Mongodin et al.
2005).
As prokaryotic genome sequences began to accumulate,
there were a number of attempts to generate whole-genome phy-logenies; however, these often resulted in trees that were incon-gruent with phylogenies based on rRNA and suggested that itmay be difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the Tree of Lifegiven the extent of LGT (Doolittle 1999). While there has beenconsiderable debate about the frequency of LGT (Gogarten et al.2002; Lawrence and Hendrickson 2003), the source of laterallytransferred genes (Daubin et al. 2003a), the most robust methodsfor detecting LGT (Koonin et al. 2001; Ragan 2001; Snel et al.2002), and its impact on phylogeny (Bapteste et al. 2004), morerecent analyses have suggested that it is possible to extract acoherent phylogenetic pattern from analysis of a “core” set
of genes (Daubin et al. 2003b; Phillipe and Douady 2003). Whilea more detailed discussion of LGT is beyond the scope of thisreview, there appears to be a consensus that it is perhaps mostappropriate that the evolution of prokaryotic species is best de-picted as a network of vertically and laterally transferred genes,rather than as an single tree. A recent report by Kunin andcolleagues (2005) has suggested that certain organisms mayserve as hubs for rapid LGT across species. One implication ofthis hypothesis is that a gene(s) conferring a selective advantage
Figure 2. Multiple forces, including genome reduction, genome rearrangement, gene duplication, and acquisition of new genes via lateral gene
transfer, are shaping microbial genomes. Details of each of these processes can be found in the text.Microbial genomics

events.
Given the extent of LGT that has been described in numer-
ous studies, a question that can be posed is whether or not it ispossible to define the pan-genome for any given bacterial species,that is, the total number of genes associated with all strains of anorganism. A recent study by Tettelin and colleagues (2005) thatexamined diversity in eight isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae has
suggested that the number of genes associated with this speciesmay be theoretically unlimited. The pan-genome can be dividedinto three parts: a core genome shared by all strains, a set ofdispensable genes shared by some but not all isolates, and a set ofstrain-specific genes associated with each isolate examined. Thecore genome encodes basic aspects of S. agalactiae biology, while
the dispensable and strain-specific genes contribute to the ge-netic diversity of the species and the ability to colonize certainniches. This contrasts with B. anthracis, for which the pan-
genome can adequately be described by four genome sequences.This difference in the type of pan-genome may reflect severalfactors, including the different lifestyles of the two organisms(i.e., exposure of S. agalactiae to diverse environments vs. occu-
pation of a more isolated biological niche by B. anthracis), the
ability of each species to acquire and stably incorporate foreignDNA, and an advantage in niche adaptation by acquisition oflaterally transferred DNA.
Comparative genomics of unicellular eukayotes has also
come of age with the completion of genome sequencing projectson a range of organisms, including a number of apicomplexa(Plasmodium spp., Theileria spp., Cyrptosporidium spp.), trypano-
somes (Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania major), amoe-
bae (Dictyostelium discoideum and Entamoeba histolytica), micro-
sporidia (Encephalitozoon cuniculi), and nucleomorphs (Guillarida
theta). It is of interest that there are a number of parallels betweenunicellular eukayotes and prokaryotes. As observed with bacterialspecies, these unicellular eukaryotes differ tremendously in ge-nome size, genome organization (chromosome number, genedensity, and the presence and size of introns), and gene number.Genome reduction is also a force in the unicellular eukaryoticworld, as evidenced by the minimal genomes of G. theta (0.55
Mb) (Douglas et al. 2001) and E. cuniculi (2.51 Mb) (Katinka et al.
2001). In these species, gene density, at approximately one geneper 1.2 Mb, approaches that observed in the prokaryotic world,and many metabolic genes have been lost, making these speciesdependent on their hosts for energy and small molecules. Otherunicellular eukaryotes, such as two species of Theileria (Gardner
et al. 2005; Pain et al. 2005) and Cryptosporidium (Abrahamsen et
al. 2004; Xu et al. 2004) protists, represent organisms with mod-erately compact genomes with a gene density of approximatelyone gene per 2 Mb. In these cases, genome reduction also resultsfrom gene loss, particularly with regard to metabolic genes andplastid-related genes (Keeling 2004), together with reduced in-tron content (Cryptosporidium) or reduced intergenic space (Thei-
leria). Despite the fact that a number of unicellular genomes haveundergone reductive evolution, recent studies on two Cryptospo-
ridium spp. (Abrahamsen et al. 2004; Xu et al. 2004) and the
protist Entameoeba histolytica (Loftus et al. 2005) have lent sup-
port to the idea of unicellular eukaryote acquisition of bacterialgenes involved in cellular metabolism through LGT.
Applications of microbial genomics
Approximately 40% of the bacterial species that have been tar-geted for genome analysis represent important human patho-gens. Comparative in silico methods are allowing for correlationsto be made between genotype and phenotype in many instances.For example, the Chlamydiaceae represent a group of closely re-lated obligate intracellular pathogens that cause a range of dis-eases in mammalian and avian hosts. Genome analysis of severalmembers of this clade has revealed a limited number of variablemetabolic and cell surface genes, clustered in the replication ter-mination region, that account for much of the differences intissue and host tropism between species (Read et al. 2003; Thom-son et al. 2005). An unexpected finding from Chlamydia genomesequencing projects was the discovery of a number of genes withsimilarity to enterobacterial virulence factors (Read et al. 2003),suggesting that the Chlamydiae may have been reservoirs forvirulence genes at some distant point in the evolution of theenterobacteria.
Transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have also pro-
vided insights into genes involved in virulence, the molecularbasis of host specificity, and host–pathogen interactions. Oneadvantage of such large-scale approaches is the ability to monitorglobal changes in gene and protein expression in both the patho-gen and the host during the infectious process. Another is thatthey can be used to study genes and proteins whose function isunknown. Recent transcriptome studies of Neisseria meningiti-
dis—a causative agent of septicemia and meningococcal menin-gitis—provide an excellent example of how transcriptome analy-sis can be exploited (Grifantini et al. 2002; Dietrich et al. 2003).These studies showed that there were distinct sets of genes thatwere differentially regulated during two key steps in the menin-gococcal infection of human cells—the initial interaction withepithelial cells in the respiratory tract, and the later interactionwith endothelial cells in the blood–brain barrier. These differen-tially regulated genes —which encode membrane transporters,
transcription factors, general metabolic pathways proteins, and anumber of hypothetical proteins—are obvious candidates for fur-ther studies that in turn could lead to novel approaches to pre-venting diseases caused by N. meningitidis.
One of the goals of genome-enabled research on human
pathogens is the development of novel diagnostics, antimicro-bial compounds, and vaccines. While progress is being made onall fronts, there have been a number of successes in the applica-tion of genome sequence data to the identification of novel vac-cine candidates. A new method, reverse vaccinology, has beendescribed that allows for identification of potential vaccine can-didates based on genomic information, rather than the moretraditional approach toward vaccine development pioneered byPasteur more than two centuries ago, which requires growing theinfectious agent as a first step (Rappuoli 2000). This approach hasbeen successfully applied to rapid vaccine development against anumber of human pathogens, including Neisseria meningitidis
(Pizza et al. 2000; Tettelin et al. 2000), Streptococcus pneumoniae
(Ross et al. 2001; Wizemann et al. 2001), Chlamydia spp. (Grandi
2003), as well as the viral pathogen that causes severe acute res-piratory disease (SARS) (Bukreyev et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2004).While reverse vaccinology has proven to be very promising ingenerating a protective immune response in various animal mod-els of disease, the results of ongoing clinical trials of these novelvaccine candidates will provide the ultimate test of the effective-ness of this approach to find new vaccines of benefit to humans.
Because of their unique metabolic properties, a variety of
environmental organisms with potential utility in catabolic deg-radation of toxic compounds or other bioremediation processeshave also been targeted for sequencing and functional analysis.Fraser-Liggett

teobacteria and has the ability to precipitate soluble metals such
as iron and uranium as a by-product of electron transport. Ge-nome analysis of G. sulfurreducens (Methe et al. 2003) revealed
the presence of a large number of c-type cytochromes and sug-gested the existence of a large number of redundant electrontransport networks. A subsequent study demonstrated that elec-tron transport in G. sulfurreducens occurs through direct contact
of the pili with iron oxides and suggests that it may be possible toengineer biologically based conductive materials (Reguera et al.2005). Continued exploration of the metabolic capabilities ofmicrobes with potential bioremediation and biotransformationcapabilities will be facilitated by the increasing availability ofgenome sequence data, together with the development of toolsand databases for reconstruction of metabolic pathways such asEcoCyc (Keseler et al. 2005), the Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Da-tabase (Hou et al. 2004), and OptStrain (Pharkya et al. 2004), andnew approaches for gene and genome synthesis (Smith et al.2003; Tian et al. 2004).
Metabolic engineering of microbes is an area of long-
standing industrial interest, especially for the production ofsmall molecules. Genomics-based methodologies, includingcomparative DNA sequencing, transcriptome, proteome, andmetabolome profiling, together with in silico modeling andsimulation, have become important tools in bioengineeringstrategies (for review, see Lee et al. 2005). The potential of thisapproach to generate predictive models of cellular behavior wasrecently demonstrated by Fong et al. (2005), who engineered E.
colistrains with improved production of lactic acid based on the
genome-scale metabolic analysis together with adapted evolu-tion of the new strains. The use of “omics” data to generate
predictive models is still in its infancy and is limited by severalfactors, including a comprehensive lack of information on regu-latory networks and the challenges of integrating data acrossmultiple scales and times. However, one of the most excitingareas of future genome-enabled research will be in systems biol-ogy.
Metagenomics: Another new frontier
Despite all of the progress in microbial genomics in the past 10years, it is important to remember that essentially all of theprojects completed to date have been focused on species that canbe grown in culture. Given that >99% of the prokaryotes in theenvironment cannot be cultured in the laboratory, we are stillgreatly limited in our knowledge about the physiology and ecol-ogy of microbial communities (Schloss and Handelsman 2005).While small-subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes have beenused in surveys of diversity in the uncultured prokaryotic worldfor some time, this information cannot provide any insights intothe biology or species interactions in communities. The morerecent application of high-throughput sequencing technologytogether with newer algorithms for sequence assembly havegiven rise to the field of metagenomics (Riesenfeld et al. 2004),which has provided unprecedented access to and informationabout uncultured microbial communities. Two studies publishedin 2004 demonstrated the power of this approach, particularlywith simple microbial communities.
Using a whole-genome shotgun approach, Tyson et al.
(2004) were able to reconstruct two almost complete genomesequences of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II and
the partial sequence of three other species from a low-complexityacid mine drainage biofilm growing underground within a pyriteore body. This was possible because the community was domi-

follow-up studies, both in vitro and in silico. The ultimate goal is to integrate data from these multiple approaches to achieve a new systems-level

each organism revealed specific pathways for carbon and nitro-gen fixation and energy generation. A larger project publishedshortly thereafter by Venter and colleagues (2004) used a whole-genome shotgun strategy to explore the diversity in the SaargassoSea. A total of almost 1.5 billion base pairs of DNA was generated,and it was estimated that this single sample of sea water con-tained /H113501800 species based on sequence relatedness. While it was
not possible in this study to reconstruct nearly complete genomesequences because of the diversity of the sample, it was possibleto identify >1.2 million new genes, including >700 new rhodop-sin-like photoreceptors that may be involved in a new form ofphototrophy in the oceans.
Because of the current limitations in assembling nearly com-
plete genome sequence data from complex communities, therehas been a renewed interest in developing methods for culturingrecalcitrant microbial species (Rappe et al. 2002; Sait et al. 2002;Tyson and Banfield 2005). Several recent successes in these ef-forts have been reported that will most certainly facilitate follow-up functional genomics studies.
Conclusions
Although we have made tremendous progress in the past decadein the field of microbial genomics, work to date represents justthe tip of the iceberg given the estimated number of microbialspecies on Earth. With the accumulation of more sequence datafrom cultivated isolates and expansion of metagenomics efforts,it is likely that the coming decade will be filled with new insightsinto the strange and often unpredictable microbial world. Sys-tems-based approaches that integrate DNA sequence with datafrom transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome studies will be-gin to reveal the intricate workings of a microbial cell (Fig. 3).
