Abstract Escherichia coli strain DH5 αwas successfully
employed in the decolorization of commercial anthraquinone
and azo dyes, belonging to the general classes of acid or basic
dyes. The bacteria showed an aptitude to survive at different
pH values on any dye solution tested, and a rapid decoloriza-
tion was obtained under aerobic conditions for the whole col-
lection of dyes. A deep investigation about the mode of actionofE. coli was carried out to demonstrate that dye decoloriza-
tion mainly occurred via three different pathways, specificallybacterial induced precipitation, cell wall adsorption, and me-tabolism, whose weight was correlated with the chemical na-
ture of the dye. In the case of basic azo dyes, an unexpected
fast decolorization was observed after just 2-h postinoculationunder aerobic conditions, suggesting that metabolism was the
main mechanism involved in basic azo dye degradation, as
unequivocally demonstrated by mass spectrometric analysis.The reductive cleavage of the azo group by E. coli on basic
azo dyes was also further demonstrated by the inhibition ofdecolorization occurring when glucose was added to the dyesolution. Moreover, no residual toxicity was found in the
E. coli -treated basic azo dye solutions by performing Daphnia
magna acute toxicity assays. The results of the present studydemonstrated that E. coli can be simply exploited for its nat-
ural metabolic pathways, without applying any recombinant
technology. The high versatility and adaptability of this bac-
terium could encourage its involvement in industrial bioreme-
diation of textile and leather dyeing wastewaters.

Introduction
Acid and basic dyes are some of the most extensively used
colorants within the textile and leather industry (Hunger2002 ). Their wide application involves routine dyeing proce-
dures, which may differ among dyers for the number of stepsand/or chemical auxiliaries used to favor dyeing homogeneity(Shore 2002 ). As a result of the large number and different
nature of the chemicals used, the wastewaters generated fromthe dyeing of textile and leather materials are some of themajor polluting chemical containing wastes (Claudio 2007 ;
Slater 2003 ). Although progresses have been made to replace
the chemical auxiliaries with natural or semisynthetic sub-stances in a view to generating more environmentally friendly
wastewaters (de Sousa et al. 2011), the traditional dyes are still
in use and represent one of the main sources of pollution forwater streams (Alinsafi et al. 2007 ). These dyes cause serious
environmental and health concerns to aqueous ecosystems
and humans (Sarnaik and Kanekar 1995 ), due to their toxicity
(de Campos Ventura-Camargo and Marin-Morales 2013 ).
Typically, dyeing baths contain a nominal percentage of dyebetween 1 and 15 % by weight of material, but 2 up to 50 % of
the original dye is generally lost in the wastewaters, depending
on the class of the dye used (Khan et al. 2013 ; Ogugbue andElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article

particular, the global annual production of leather and textile
dyes is 7×105T, for an annual trade of these industries that is
over 2 and 70 million tons, respectively (The Freedonia Group
2013 ; Zaharia and Suteu 2012 ). Therefore, the environmental
impact of the effluents from the dyeing industry is a serious
concern. In addition, the disposal of dyeing effluents consti-
tutes the largest portion of the costs associated to water man-
agement (Slater 2003 ). Various treatments for dye-containing
wastewaters have been developed, to address these environ-
mental and economical issues: mainly chemical and electro-
chemical oxidation, filtration on micromembranes, precipita-tion of dyes in the form of insoluble salts, photocatalytic deg-
radation, and adsorption or electrosorption (Singh and Arora
2011; Forgacs et al. 2004 ; Hao et al. 2000 ; Avlonitis et al.
2008 ; Berberidou et al. 2009 ; Harrelkas et al. 2009 ; Zhao
et al. 2009 ). Unfortunately, all these methods are highly costly
and thus commercially unattractive. Therefore, it is mandatoryto develop alternative means of dye decolorization, such as
innovative biological methods, to provide more economical
cleanup protocols and allow the recycling of industrial treatedwastewaters.
In recent years, bioremediation and more generally bio-
technologies have gathered growing interest because of their
cost-effective and eco-friendly profile (Khan et al. 2013 ;A l i
2010 ; Solís et al. 2012 ). Some algae (Daneshvar et al. 2007 ;
Khataee et al. 2010 ), bacteria (Ayed et al. 2010 ; Amoozegar
et al. 2011; Saratale et al. 2011), fungi (Kaushik and Malik
2009 ; Novotný et al. 2011; Verma et al. 2012 ; Ali et al. 2008 ;
Jin et al. 2007 ; Xian-Chun et al. 2007 ; Fu and Viraraghavan
2001 ; Marimuthu et al. 2013 ; Tegli et al. 2014 ), and yeasts
(Vitor and Corso 2008 ;Q ue ta l . 2012 )w e r ep r o v e dt oa c h i e v e
acceptable and efficient dye removal. The vast majority of theresearch on biological decolorization has been carried out on
fungi and mainly on their ligninolytic enzymes, discovered todegrade azo dyes aerobically (Erkurt et al. 2010 ). Conversely,
studies on dye removal operated by bacteria are relatively lessreported (Pokharia and Ahluwalia 2013 ;S a t h e e s hB a b ue ta l .
2013 ;P a n d e ye ta l . 2007 ), although the bacterial decoloriza-
tion is normally faster than the fungal systems (Shobana andThangam 2012 ). Several bacteria have been shown to degrade
azo dyes (Saratale et al. 2011), and it has been documented
that decolorization occurs via bacterial azoreductases, follow-ed by the aerobic mineralization of colorless amines (Pandeyet al. 2007 ; Van der Zee and Villaverde 20
 05). Generally, this
two-step process may require a bacterial consortium to suc-cessfully complete the azo dye biodegradation task, but thereproducibility profile is often low undermining potential in-
dustrial applications (Phugare et al. 2011). The most exten-
sively studied bacterial species belong to the genus
Pseudomonas (e.g., P . luteola )( C h a n ge ta l . 2001 ;C h e na n d
Lin2007 ). Surprisingly, the degrading abilities of enteric bac-
teria have been by far less investigated (Chen et al. 2004 ;M a t eand Pathade 2012 ;C h a ne ta l . 2012 ) including Escherichia
colifrequently used to produce recombinant proteins and
overexpress foreign bacterial genes coding for azoreductaseenzymes (Lon čar et al. 2013 ;I sįk and Sponza 2003 ;S a n d h y a
et al. 2008 ; Chang and Lin 2001 ; Chang et al. 2000 ).
In this paper, we explored for the first time the aerobic dye
degrading performances of E. coli DH5α, whose metabolic
potential in dye bioremediation has been rarely explored to thebest of our knowledge (Rau et al. 2002 ). This strain is highly
adaptable, it has the aptitude to switch between aerobic and
anaerobic lifestyles (Dougan et al. 2001 ), and it is character-
ized by fast growth kinetic even on very simple nutrient media
(Sezonov et al. 2007 ).E. coli DH5αwas tested on several azo
and anthraquinone dyes among those most commonly usedwithin the dyeing industry. The kinetics of decolorization andthe influence of operational parameters were also studied on a
representative dye for each chemical group. A significant abi-
otic dye removal was also revealed, which rarely has beenconsidered in previous studies (Sarioglu et al. 2007 ).
Materials and methods
Dyes
The 15 dyes used in this study were kindly provided by
Tintoria Cometa Srl (Prato, Italy) and were of commercial
quality. These dyes were grouped according to their chemicalnature: acid anthraquinone (group A), acid azo (group B),
basic anthraquinone (group C), basic azo (group D). The
name, CAS number, and the wavelength of maximum absorp-tion (λ
max) of each dye are reported in Table 1.E x p e r i m e n t s
were carried out with an initial concentration of 0.3 mg/ml ofeach dye dissolved in double distilled water.
E. coli growth conditions and culture media
The bacterial strain used in this study was E. coli DH5α(DSM
No. 6897 at Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures), grown aerobically at
37 °C on Luria –Bertani broth (LB) (BD Biosciences, Milan,
Italy, supplemented with 15 mg/l of nalidixic acid (Sigma
Aldrich Co, Milan, Italy)), under orbital shaking (150 rpm).
Overnight bacterial cultures having an OD
600=1 were har-
vested by centrifugation (5000 g, 10 min at room temperature)
and washed twice with sterile physiological solution (NaCl8.5 % w/win water). Subsequently, the bacterial pellets were
used for decolorization experiments. The average wet weight
biomass of E. coli culture sampled from an early stationary
phase was approximately 1.0 mg/ml, corresponding to about5×10
9cells/ml.8236 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2015) 99:8235 –8245Decolorization assays: experimental and analytical
procedures
Batch decolorization assays were carried out by inoculating
E. coli in 50-ml Falcon tubes (BD Biosciences), containing
20 ml of LB medium amended separately with each of thedyes reported in Table 1, at known concentrations. The decol-
orization performances were systematically analyzed as a
function of the following parameters: static or shaken
(150 rpm) cultures, incubation temperature (25 and 37 °C),initial dye concentration, and 15-mg wet weight biomass. The
effect of glucose, ammonium chloride, and ammonium sulfate
onE. coli decolorizing activity was also investigated, by
adding separately these nutrients (500, 250, and 250 mg/l,
respectively) to the decolorizing medium. Negative controls
with uninoculated dye medium and heat-killed E. coli cells
(10 min at 100 °C) were also performed. Treatments and con-
trols were run in triplicate, in three independent experiments.
Incubation of E. coli on decolorizing medium was kept up
to a maximum of 48 h. Aliquots were periodically and asep-tically sampled, centrifuged (5000 g, 5 min at room tempera-
ture) to collect the biomass as a pellet, and filtered on 0.2- μm
sterile cellulose acetate Nalgene® filter (VWR, Milan, Italy).
AU V –Vis spectrophotometer (Infinite 200Pro, Tecan,
Seetrasse, Switzerland) was used to measure the λ
maxof the
supernatants of each dye. The percentage of dye reduction(DR%) was calculated according to the following:
DR¼ A

where DR=decolorization as percentage; A 0and A 1,i n i t i a l
and final absorbance at the λmaxof each dye in the visible
region. The pH of the supernatants was also measured, usinga Basic 20-Crison pH meter (Carpi, Italy). Bacterial growth
was measured as cell biomass.
Experimental data were subjected to statistical analysis to
determine means and the corresponding standard deviations.Significant differences between means of experiments were
determined by analysis of variance (ANOV A) with a signifi-
cance level of 0.05.
Mass spectrometry
A 50.0- μl aliquot of each dye solution subjected to decol-
orization was diluted with 2 ml of HPLC grade methanol
(Fisher Scientific, Leicestershire, UK) and then filtered on
Titan2® Syringe Filter (ThermoFisher Scientific, Austin
TX, USA). The filtered sample was analyzed using aThermoScientific LCQ-Flee t mass spectrometer under
electrospray ionization (ESI) (Thermo Scientific, AustinTX, USA) by direct infusion with a 500 KL Hamiltonmicrosyringe and using a 10- μl/min flow. Data were ac-
quired over hundred scans, afte r stabilization of the ionic
current for 5 min at the above mentioned sample flow.The mass spectrometer parameters used were as follows:
sheet gas flow=10, auxiliary gas flow=0, sweep gas
flow=0, spray voltage=5.00 kV, capillary tube tempera-ture=220 °C, capillary voltage=12.0 V, and tube lens=
77.8 V.
Toxicity assay
The short-term tests to determine acute toxicity were carried
out using the water flea Daphnia magna , a standardized test
organism for toxicity assays and proposed as a representativeTable 1 Commercial dyes

were used for toxicity bioassay and were not fed during thetest period. For each sample and each experimental condition,25 organisms were tested in triplicate, along with negative
(water) and positive (untreated dye) controls. The number of

Results
Preliminary screening on E. coli dye decolorization ability
Initially, a general screening about the E. coli decoloriza-
tion abilities was carried out for the whole selection ofdyes, to evaluate the bacterial activity on a wide range ofcolorants. The solutions were inoculated with an overnight
starter culture of E. coli in shaken tubes at constant tem-
perature (25 and 37 °C). The pH of each sample was mon-
itored at the beginning and at the end of the experiment.
E. coli modified the initial pH of each sample to a value
oscillating between 6 and 7 regardless of the incubation
temperature. This behavior was coherent with the bacterial
growth, which was recorded positive for each sample and
generally higher at 37 °C, as expected (Fig. 1a). Therefore,
it was not surprising that the visible spectrophotometric
analysis of the supernatants showed a sensible decrease
in dye concentration (Fig. 1b).
The decolorization was statistically similar at 37 and
25 °C, except for dye A40. Conversely, a stronger decolor-ization was obtained for compounds A357, B41, B46, andB 5 1a t3 7° C .A l s o ,i tw a si n t e r e s t i n gt on o t et h a tw h e nt h e
bacterial biomass of each experiment was separated from
the treated dye solutions and visually examined, the bacte-rial pellets retained some of the original color in the case of
dyes of groups A, B, and C. On the other hand, no colora-
tion was observed for dyes of group D (data not shown),since the original color had completely vanished from both
the supernatant and the pellet. It is known that some bacte-
ria may degrade azo dyes, here represented by groups B and
D, through specific azoreductase enzymes and during an-
aerobic growth (Liu et al. 2009). In our case, this event may
have happened in aerobic growth conditions. However, the
data did not allow to understand which mechanisms were
involved in the decolorization of dyes. Therefore, A324,A361, B47, and B46 were selected as representative dyes
of each group, in order to carry out further investigation to
clarify the mode of action of E. coli .Analysis of decolorization behavior of E. coli
The decolorization of dyes may take place according tovery different mechanisms, such as adsorption and degra-
dation (Saratale et al. 2011 ). In the first case, dyes are
adsorbed onto the bacterial cell surface, while when dyes
are going to be degraded by bacterial enzymes, they are
first compartmentalized insi de the bacterial cells. The rep-
resentative colorants were treated with E. coli f o r1 6ha t
37 °C. Afterward, the biomasses were separated from thesupernatants (hereafter named Bfirst generation superna-
tants ^for the total decolorization), and the resulting bacte-
rial pellets were washed with w ater. This step was repeated
until the absorbance of the supernatant washing water was
completely clear at naked eye. These supernatants (hereaf-ter named Bsecond generation supernatants ^) corresponded
to the washing of the dye probably precipitated andadsorbed on the bacterial cell surface. Subsequently, eachpellet was subjected to thermal lysis in water at 100 °C for
10 min and separated from the supernatant (hereafter
named Bthird generation supernatants ^) which contained
the intracellular dye portion (Fig. 2). The spectrophotomet-
ric analysis in the visible region of the supernatants thusobtained from A324, A361, and B47 confirmed that their
λ
maxwas consistent with that of the untreated dye (Table 2).
These results were also consistent with the data derived
from the mass spectrometric analysis of the supernatants
(Fig. 3). The E. coli pellets derived from the decolorization
on A324 and A361 released the color both during the wash-
ing and the lysis procedure, suggesting the presence of the
dyes both on the bacterial surface and inside the bacterial
cell wall, respectively. The same also occurred for B47,although to a lesser extent. However, data obtained from
second generation supernatants could not exclude a poten-
tial dye precipitation induced by bacterial addition and cellgrowth. Visible spectra of B46 supernatants did not exhibit
anyλ
maxconsistent with this dye. The differences between
the absorbance of the first generation supernatants and
those combined from the second and third generation su-
pernatants were correlated to the metabolic contribution of
E. coli to the overall decolorization. Metabolism was 27,
36, and 45 % for A324, A361, and B47, respectively. In the
case of B46, this percentage reached 98 %, clearly indicat-
ing that metabolism was the only mechanism involved indecolorization. In addition, mass spectrometric analysis
confirmed (Table 2and Fig. 3) the presence of N′-benzyl-
N′-methylbenzene-1,4-diamine 1, having a molecular
weight of 212 (Fig. S1) which would originate from the
reductive cleavage of the azo group of B46, promoted by
E. coli (Fig. 3dand Fig. S1). This transformation may have
been driven also by the cationic nature of this dye, as rep-
resented by its resonance hybrid structure 3 (Fig. S2)d u r -
ing its interaction with the degrading bacteria.8238 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2015) 99:8235 –8245Effect of bacterial biomass on E. coli decolorization
activity
Different amounts of E. coli biomass (1.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 mg
of bacterial wet weight) were inoculated separately into each
representative dye solution, and the cultures werehomogenized by mechanical stirring. An aliquot (1 ml) was
taken from each sample and centrifuged at time 0 (t 0)t oa s s e s s
whether precipitation of the dye may have been induced by
bacterial biomass. Subsequently, the cultures were incubated
at 37 °C for 48 h on an orbital shaker, sampled at 2-h interval
from t 0to 8 h, then at 24 and 48 h. The decolorization results
obtained for A324, A361, and B47 showed a nonproportional
increase in dye reduction related to the different biomass
amounts. In Fig. 4, it was reported the decolorization trend
for experiments containing the maximum amount of bacterial
biomass. Dye reduction occurred even at t 0for those three
dyes (46, 17, and 38 %, respectively) remaining practicallyconstant for 8 h, a time which implicates at least 24 E. coli
generations (Kutsu 2007 ). Finally, the decolorization percent-
age increased to a threshold value at 48 h regardless of the dye(Fig. 4). The overall profile of the experiments appeared to
remain constant, suggesting that decolorization of A324,
A361, and B47 had been occurring with a combination of
metabolism and cell-induced dye precipitation. Control exper-
iments were also prepared in the absence of bacterial biomass.After mechanical homogenization, each solution was centri-
fuged without observing any precipitation, leaving the sam-
ples on standing for 24 h.

specific metabolic activity, induced by the presence of
azoreductase enzymes produced by E. coli (Pandey et al.
2007 ).
A comparative experiment between alive and dead bacte-
rial cells shed light on the contribution of both metabolism andadsorption to the decolorizing activity of E. coli. S olutions of
A324, A361, B47, and B46 were inoculated and evaluatedafter 16 h of incubation. As reported in Fig. S3,o n l yf o r
A361, it was possible to observe a dye reduction (over
10 %) caused by the inoculation of dead cells, while for
A324 and B47, the decolorization level was less than 5 %.Conversely, there was no evidence of E. coli absorption activ-
ity on the B46 solution.
Using the same experimental conditions, we decided to ver-
ify whether the decolorization performances of E. coli were
affected by the oxygenation of the cultures (steady or shaken).The dye removal rate decreased in a range between 10 and 20 %for A324, A361, and B47, when the cultures were not under
agitation (Fig. S3). On the other hand, the experiment of B46 did
not display any significant difference related to the decolorizingperformances of E. coli cells in steady or shaken condition.
Effect of dye concentration on E. coli decolorization
activity
Culture samples were prepared at 0.06-, 0.15-, 0.3-, 0.4-, and
0.6-mg/ml dye concentration, and the solutions were inoculat-
ed with E. coli biomass. Aliquots (1 ml) were sampled at 2, 6,
8, and 24 h. As reported in Fig. 5, the analysis of the superna-
tants by visible spectrophotometry indicated that the highestpercentages of color removal for dyes A324, A361, and B47
were obtained at 0.6 mg/ml. Decolorization also showed sim-
ilar patterns from the lowest to the highest dye concentration
regardless of the initial amount of color, highlighting an al-most linear trend. The largest difference of decolorization was
observed for dye A324 from the lowest to the highest concen-
tration, whereas in the case of A361 and B47, this phenome-non was reduced of about 50 %.
Concerning compound B46, the highest percentages of de-
colorization were obtained from 0.06- to 0.3-mg/mlconcentration (Fig. 6a), and surprisingly, the decolorization
at t
4and t 24was somehow similar. This result indicated that
as the concentration of dye increased, it would not be neces-sary to prolong the experiment beyond the 4 h: or at least toextend it necessarily to t
24or longer. A marked difference was
observed for the 0.4- and 0.6-mg/ml concentrations in thesame interval of time. At the maximum concentration tested,we could assume that the relative high concentration of B46
had induced E. coli to adapt its membrane transport systems.
The decolorization after 4 h was lower than 10 % of the initial
dye concentration as indicated by the speed plot: the maxi-
mum speed of dye reduction could be observed just after 2 h at
lower concentrations (Fig. 6b).
Inhibition of E. coli azoreductase activity
The decolorization of azo dyes by bacterial strains is typicallyinitiated by azoreductase enz ymes in anaerobic condition
(Pandey et al. 2007 ). On the contrary, as previously shown,
the reduction of B46 was due to the aerobic metabolism ofE. coli . Therefore, we decided to verify the kinetic of dye
degradation in relation to the azoreductase activity. It is known
that the reduction of azo dyes is linked to the presence and
availability of cosubstrates as carbon and nitrogen sources,
and the degradation rate of bacterial cells is correlated to the
chemical structures of these molecules.
The assay for the azoreductase inhibition was carried out
for 6 h in aerobic condition at 0.15 mg/ml of B46. For eachreplicate, a specific amount of glucose (carbon source), am-monium chloride, and ammonium sulfate (nitrogen sources)
w a sa d d e d ,a t1 ,0 . 5 ,a n d0 . 5%( w/v), respectively, which had

aerobic conditions and included azoreductase activity too.
Toxicity assayThe assessment of the toxicity of the residual dye mixtures
treated with E. coli was a very important aspect for bioreme-
diation applications, to demonstrate that the solutions thus
obtained were not toxic, as well as visually clear. Acute tox-
icity tests were carried out on the representative dyes treatedwith E. coli after 16 h of incubation. As shown in Table S1,t h e
toxicity rates of B46-treated solutions were absent after 6 h.Excellent scores were achieved by A324 and A361 after 12 h(after 6 h ca. 2 and 4 %, respectively), while the worst perfor-
mances were obtained for B47 (after 12 h ca. 5 %). According
to these results, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the differ-ences here observed in the acute toxicity between the different
dyes might be mainly related to putatively different mecha-
nisms adopted by this bacteria for decolorization.
Discussion
In general, the adaptability of E. coli to xenobiotic species
such as dyes was proved by the cell growth and by the adjust-ment of the initial pH of the dye solutions to nearly neutral
values. This finding meant that the cells were inclined to make
their surrounding environment favorable to survive, althoughthe decolorization performance was found not always strictly
correlated to the bacterial growth.
Here, we demonstrated that the E. coli type strain DH5 α
worked well on acid and basic dyes under aerobic conditions,showing different mechanisms of decolorization. Both acid
anthraquinone (group A) and acid azo (group B) dyes were
removed from effluents by the combined action of precipita-
tion, cell adsorption, and metabolism. These three events havebeen rarely considered as acting altogether in previous studies
(Saratale et al. 2011; Giwa et al. 2012 ) while claiming the
metabolic activity of the bacterial biomasses as the only de-
colorizing mechanism. It is important to underline that those
phenomena occurred during cell culture growth regardless of
the amount of biomass and the type of acid dyes. It isreasonable to assume that groups A and B dyes were likelyto precipitate in the presence of E. coli already at t
0as dem-
onstrated by A324 and A361. The phenomenon can be cer-tainly described by a biotic event, since control experiments inthe absence of E. coli did not show any dye precipitation
induced by the nutrient medium or by mechanical action suchas centrifugation. The effect of biomass growth resulted in anincrease of decolorization mainly due to precipitation, cell
wall adsorption, and intracellular accumulation, although a
significant fraction could be also associated to metabolic
events, related to the activity of bacterial azo reductases (Liu
et al. 2009 ). Similar findings were also described for a basic
anthraquinone (group C) dye, which has never been reported
in previous papers to the best of our knowledge. Even in this
particular case, the presence of bacterial biomass induced a
strong precipitation effect at t
0, causing a reduction of metab-
olism contribution. It was interesting to notice that the differ-
ent chemical nature of A324 and B47 anthraquinone dyes
caused their opposite contribution between metabolism (27and 45 %, respectively) and precipitation effect (46 and
38 %, respectively). This phenomenon is related to the differ-
ent chemical affinity of acid or basic anthraquinone dyes to thecell wall of the Gram-negative E. coli .
Degradation of basic azo dyes (group D) occurred efficient-
ly under aerobic conditions, confirming the metabolic path-way of E. coli involving oxygen-resistant azo reductases. This
result was also consistent with recent findings, which demon-strated the prominent role of E. coli AzoR-purified enzyme
under aerobic conditions (Mercier et al. 2013 ). The remark-
ably high rate of decolorization for B46 was found to be de-pendent on the amount of biomass and the concentration of
dye. Conversely, metabolic contribution to total dye reduction
on A324, A361, and B47 was even lower than 50 %, probablybecause of the absence of redox mediators as recently reported
(Cui et al. 2015 ).
Comparative trials with steady and shaken alive cells con-
firmed that precipitation and absorption phenomena contrib-uted in a different way to the total dye reduction for A324,
A361, and B47, whereas B46 underwent enzymatic degrada-tion. This concept may be indirectly confirmed by the decol-
orization of B46, which resulted marginally affected by steady
and shaken biomass. In this case, it could be remarked that0102030405060708090100

degradation activated by E. coli , demonstrated by the absence
of any degradation with dead cells.
Experiments carried out on A324, A361, and B47 at vari-
able amount of color demonstrated that E. coli was able to
keep a similar behavior across the whole incubation time
and regardless of the initial dye concentration. These findings
may have important implications at industrial level: particu-
larly for the textile industry, which exploits the vast majorityof the global production of dyes. The variation of dye concen-
tration in effluents is quite often unpredictable and fluctuating,
due to dye reactivity with water, dye fixation, and variableexhaustion of the dyeing bath (Ghaly et al. 2014 ). In the case
of B46, E. coli showed a stronger ability to metabolize basic
azo dyes at the typical concentration founded in effluents aftera dyeing processes. Only 2 h was sufficient to completely
remove B46 from trial solution. Mass spectrometric analysis
demonstrated that metabolite 1 was originated by reductivecleavage (Pandey et al. 2007 ) of B46 and further degraded
byE. coli in aerobic conditions. Also, compound 1 resulted
compatible with the toxicity prescriptions of REACH (EC2006 ). The cationic nature of B46 was crucial for its quanti-
tative uptake and degradation by E. coli , due to the high af-
finity of this dye for the bacterial cell wall and membrane
structure. This assumption could be explained taking into ac-
count the Hard-Soft-Acid-base model (Ho 1975 ). The lone
pair of the N′-benzyl- N′-methyl moiety of B46 is delocalized
through the azophenyl fragment into the triazole ring, asshown by the resonance hybrid structure 3, defined a softcation because of the distribution of the positive charge onto
multiple centers. It follows that compounds such as 3 interact
quite well with lipids and phospholipids of the bacterial cellwall and membrane, since the negatively charged polar heads
are diffused soft anions. Consequently, electrostatic interac-
tions between the dye and the cell anions are supposed beingdriven entropically to establish a soft-cation-soft-anion couple
(the B46 cation and the phospholipid anion) and a hard-
cation-hard-anion couple (sodium cation and bromide anion).
The inhibition of bacterial decolorization by glucose on
B46 further demonstrated that the reductive cleavage of theazo group took place under aerobic conditions. In addition, noresidual toxicity was found in the E. coli -treated basic azo dye
solutions. Thus, the observed differences in the acute toxicitycould be related to a complete process of dye metabolism,excluding the formation of undesirable aromatic amines (EC
2006 ).
The results of the present study have important implica-
tions from an industrial point of view, since margins to imple-ment such a bioremediation technology would be flexible to
achieve the decolorization of textile and leather dyeing waste-waters in short time spells. Moreover, interesting recent results
have opened the opportunity to select E. coli DH5αpopula-
tions, by bacterial biomass recycle, in order to increase theirdecolorization abilities (Corsi, unpublished observations). Sofar, this approach has been applied to the new class of
Bnaturalized ^dyes (Pellegrini et al. 2015 ), water soluble and
eco-friendly, synthesized from chromophores of commercial
disperse colorants. Overall, these perspectives will represent
further attractive improvements for E. coli dye decolorization
in textile and leather industries, beyond the general classes of
acid and basic dyes here studied.
