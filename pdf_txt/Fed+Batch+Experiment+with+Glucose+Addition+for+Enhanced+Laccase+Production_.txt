Moreover, environmental issues such as global warming and glacier melting, underscore the need for alternative renewable energy sources. To address these challenges and align with the long-term goals of a sustainable circular economy, lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), an abundant and renewable feedstock, has garnered significant attention as resource that can fulfill energy needs while reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental concerns.  Establishing biorefineries for microbial fermentation of LCB for value-added products and energy production is a promising way to convert such materials efficiently and economically. To be used in fermentation processes, LCB requires a previous step of pretreatment to disassemble lignin, breakdown hemicellulose, diminish cellulose crystallinity and liberate monomeric sugars for fermentation. However, despite releasing sugars, pretreatment also generate distinct toxic compounds including furans, phenolic compounds, and weak acids, which inhibit the microbial metabolism during fermentation. Therefore, to have a successful fermentation, the concentration of inhibitory compounds needs to be reduced to a minimum that do not affect the microbial performance. Detoxification methods to reduce the concentration of inhibitors in hemicellulosic hydrolysates are currently challenged by low efficiency, prolonged operational time, high costs, undesired sugar loss, and environmental concerns. Alternatively, microbial detoxification with bacteria able to degrade specific inhibitors could be a valuable option to avoid such challenges.  In this thesis, the ability of six bacteria to consume inhibitory compounds present in brewer’s spent grain (BSG - a scarcely valorized and abundant by-product of beer industry) hemicellulosic hydrolysate was assessed. Two out of the six bacteria, namely P. putida and Rhodococcus sp., were further studied for their ability to metabolize some of the most frequent lignocellulose-derived inhibitors as sole carbon source. Then, BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysate was used to produce 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) by Paenibacillus polymyxa. 2,3-BDO is a versatile platform chemical with diverse applications across industries, and with a current global market value of US$ 270.4 Mn (million), projected to grow 3.5% in the next 8 years. Presently, the industrial production of 2,3-BDO primarily relies on petroleum-derived hydrocarbons but high production yield has been shown by the bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa. Different strategies have been studied to enhance the production of 2,3-BDO and the development of a more sustainable bioprocess for its production, including: 1) reducing by- 11 products formation; 2) improving bacterial productivity by genetic engineering; 3) optimizing the fermentation parameters. Utilization of cheap and abundant agro-industrial biomasses remains the best alternative for the development of biomanufacturing in-line with the principle of circular economy. In this thesis, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) processes were used in monoculture of P. polymyxa and also in co-culture of this strain with an engineered P. putida (unable to use sugars), utilizing BSG as a feedstock. Co-culture was proposed for detoxification of lignocellulosic-derived inhibitory compounds. An enhanced production of 2,3-BDO (20.94 g/L) was achieved using SSCF, when the microbial detoxification of inhibitory compounds was operated. This approach represents a significant progress for the establishment of an efficient biomanufacturing of 2,3-BDO from lignocellulosic biomass. This study was concluded with a techno-economic assessment of the SSCF process using a co-culture system of P. polymyxa with Pseudomonas putida for 2,3-BDO production from BSG.     12 Sammenfatning Den globale energiefterspørgsel oplever hurtig vækst, og fossile reserver kan ikke længere imødekomme dette behov. Desuden understreger miljøproblemer som global opvarmning og gletsjersmeltning behovet for alternative, vedvarende energikilder. For at imødekomme disse udfordringer og være i tråd med de langsigtede mål for en bæredygtig cirkulær økonomi, har lignocellulosebiomasse (LCB), en rigelig og vedvarende råvare, fået betydelig opmærksomhed som en ressource, der kan opfylde energibehov, samtidig med at reducere afhængigheden af fossile brændstoffer og afhjælpe miljømæssige bekymringer. Etablering af bioraffinaderier til mikrobiel fermentering af LCB for værditilføjede produkter og energiproduktion er en lovende måde at konvertere sådanne materialer effektivt og økonomisk. For at blive brugt i fermenteringsprocesser kræver LCB et forudgående trin af forbehandling for at adskille lignin, nedbryde hemicellulose, formindske cellulosekrystallinitet og frigøre monomere sukkerarter til fermentering. Men trods frigivelsen af sukker, genererer forbehandlingen også forskellige toksiske forbindelser, såsom furaner, phenolforbindelser og svage syrer, som hæmmer den mikrobielle metabolisme under fermentering. Derfor, for at have en succesfuld fermentering, skal koncentrationen af hæmmende forbindelser reduceres til et minimum, der ikke påvirker den mikrobielle ydeevne. Afgiftningsteknikker til at reducere koncentrationen af inhibitorer i hemicellulosehydrolysat er i øjeblikket udfordret af lav effektivitet, lang driftstid, høje omkostninger, uønsket sukkertab og miljømæssige bekymringer. Alternativt kunne mikrobiel afgiftning med bakterier, der er i stand til at nedbryde specifikke inhibitorer, være en værdifuld mulighed for at undgå sådanne udfordringer. I denne afhandling blev evnen af seks bakterier til at forbruge hæmmende forbindelser til stede i bryggeriets brugte korn (BSG - et knap værdsat og rigeligt biprodukt fra ølindustrien) hemicellulosehydrolysat vurderet. To ud af de seks bakterier, nemlig P. putida og Rhodococcus sp., blev yderligere undersøgt for deres evne til at metabolisere nogle af de hyppigste lignocellulose-afledte inhibitorer som eneste kulstofkilde.  Herefter blev BSG hemicellulosehydrolysat anvendt til at producere 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) med Paenibacillus polymyxa. 2,3-BDO er et alsidigt platformskemikalie med forskellige anvendelser i industrien og med en nuværende global markedsværdi på 270,4 millioner USD, forventet at vokse med 3,5 % i de næste 8 år. I øjeblikket er den industrielle produktion af 2,3-BDO primært baseret på petroleum-afledte kulbrinter, men høj produktionsudbytte er vist af bakterien Paenibacillus polymyxa. Forskellige strategier er blevet undersøgt for at forbedre  13 produktionen af 2,3-BDO og udviklingen af en mere bæredygtig bioprocess til dens produktion, herunder: 1) reduktion af biproduktdannelse; 2) forbedring af bakteriel produktivitet ved genetisk manipulation; 3) optimering af fermenteringsparametre. Anvendelsen af billig og rigelig agroindustriel biomasse forbliver den bedste mulighed for udvikling af biomanufacturing i overensstemmelse med princippet om cirkulær økonomi. I denne afhandling blev Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) og Simultaneous Saccharification and Co-Fermentation (SSCF) anvendt i monocultur af P. polymyxa og i co-kultur med en modificeret P. putida (som ikke kan bruge sukker). Co-kultur blev foreslået til afgiftning af lignocellulose-afledt medium fra inhibitoriske forbindelser. Det er blevet bevist med stærk evidens, at forbedret produktion af 2,3-BDO (20,94 g/L) er opnåeligt med SSCF af BSG, når mikrobiel afgiftning af inhibitoriske forbindelser opereres. Denne tilgang repræsenterer store fremskridt i effektiv implementering af biomanufacturing for 2,3-BDO-produktion fra lignocellulosebiomasse. Denne undersøgelse blev afsluttet med en teknisk-økonomisk vurdering af SSCF-processen ved brug af et co-kultursystem af P. polymyxa med Pseudomonas putida for 2,3-BDO-produktion fra BSG.         14 Aim of the thesis  The aim of the project was to develop a bacterial consortium for the efficient exploitation and valorization of a lignocellulosic biomass through enhanced production of a valuable commodity, mediated by microbial detoxification of the fermentation medium. Outline of the thesis Chapter 2  Six bacteria, Pseudomonas alloputida, Rhodococcus sp., Bacillus coagulans, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Acinetobacter radioresistens, and Burkholderia xenovorans, were selected from literature and were grown in three Brewer’s Spent Grain hemicellulosic hydrolysates to assess their tolerance to the inhibitors-rich medium. P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp., showed the best growth profiles and were then cultivated in a minimal medium with inhibitory compounds as sole carbon source. Both bacteria were able to metabolize certain amounts lignin-derived inhibitors. Moreover P. alloputida demonstrated exceptional tolerance and complete transformation of numerous compounds in medium supplemented with a cocktail of inhibitors (5mM vanillin, 5mM ferulic acid, 5mM p-coumaric acid,1 mM 5-HMF and 10 mM furfural).   Chapter 3  It was performed 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) production from hemicellulosic hydrolysate of brewer's spent grains (BSG-H) via co-cultivation of Paenibacillus polymyxa with Pseudomonas alloputida or Rhodococcus sp. In this chapter, it was investigated 1) the removal of potential inhibitory from the fermentation broth by Pseudomonas alloputida or Rhodococcus sp; 2) the effect on production and bioremediation of 3 temperatures (30, 34, and 37°C); 3) the importance of initial cell concentrations in co-cultures. The results showed effective removed inhibitory compounds and enhanced 2,3-BDO production in co-cultures in microplate.   15  Chapter 4  2,3-BDO production from BSG via three saccharification and fermentation approaches: Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF), Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF), and Simultaneous Saccharification and Co-Fermentation (SSCF). Fermentations were performed in 2l-reactor in monoculture and co-culture P. polymyxa and P. putida (engineered, unable to use sugars). The results highlight the efficacy of the SSCF approach, particularly when microbial detoxification by P. putida is employed.   Chapter 5  In this chapter it was performed an economic analysis includes the calculation of the Economic Potential (EPI/O) of two fermentation processes for 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) production from brewer's spent grain (BSG) in SSF and SSCF by P. polymyxa alone or in co-culture with P. putida. The objective was to evaluate the costs and profitability of these scenarios, considering the potential of BSG as a renewable resource. The results show that, before heat integration, both scenarios exhibit a negative EPI/O, indicating a lack of profitability primarily due to high energy costs associated with utilities. After heat integration SSCF showed a positive scenario proves more resilient to higher natural gas prices and exhibits higher sensitivity to 2,3-BDO prices due to its superior 2,3-BDO yield. After heat integration, the SSCF scenario demonstrates positive EPI/O suggesting the economic feasibility of 2,3-BDO production via SSCF from BSG.         16 Publications  Manuscript I Microbial detoxification of Brewer's Spent Grain hydrolysates: evaluation of bacterial tolerance and their ability to metabolize inhibitory compounds from lignocellulose Erlinda Rama, João G.

To be submitted for publication             Chapter 1 General introduction               18 1.1 Lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable resource   The global energy demand is experiencing rapid growth and shows no signs of deceleration (Semieniuk et al., 2021). While traditional energy sources, such as fossil reserves (coal, natural gas, crude oil), have historically met these demands, their reliance is delayed by limited supply, high carbon emissions, and rapid depletion (Davies & Simmons, 2021).  Factors like growing fuel prices and environmental issues, such as global warming, acid rains, and glacier melting, underscore the need for alternative renewable energy sources (Mankar et al., 2021). To address these challenges and align with the long-term goals of a sustainable circular economy, lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), an abundant and annually renewable feedstock, has garnered significant attention as resource that can fulfil future energy needs while reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental concerns (Ahmad et al., 2020).  Recent years have seen LCB utilization to produce biofuels. Initially, the production of first-generation (1G) biofuels involved the use of edible crops like sugary or starchy crops, leading to the generation of biogas, bioethanol, and biodiesel (Zandona Filho et al., 2022). However, this approach raised the food vs. fuel debate and escalated crop prices (Mahapatra & Kumar, 2020). To overcome these challenges, non-edible crops such as agro-industrial residues have been utilized to produce second-generation (2G) biofuels, showing significant potential to replace traditional fuel sources (Patel & Shah, 2021).  Furthermore, biotechnology has been enriched with a large number of studies aiming at efficient exploitation of LCB derived from agroindustry to produce bio-based chemicals and polymers (Gao et al., 2011; Velvizhi et al., 2022). Despite all the efforts, most of the agro-industrial biomasses are nowadays underutilized, primarily regarded as waste. An example of this is Brewers’ spent grain (BSG), which is generated in large quantities from beer industry but is poorly used, mainly disposed, or burned or sold as animal feed (Johnson et al., 2010). 1.1.1 Lignocellulose structure and the need of pretreatment for its exploitation A comprehensive understanding of the constituents within any biomass type is essential to comprehend the structural complexities and recalcitrant nature of typical LCB, highlighting the limitations of its usage (Bajpai, 2016). The recalcitrance of LCB due to a three-dimensional complex network that determines the rigidity and inaccessibility within plant cellular wall.  19 LCBs are formed by three major components: cellulose (35–50%), hemicellulose (20–35%), and lignin (5–30%) (Fengel & Wegener, 1984). The relative proportions of these components may significantly vary based on feedstock source.  Cellulose is a highly ordered polysaccharide of glucose units connected linearly via β-1,4 glycosidic linkage, organized in microfibrils to form a crystalline structure with high polymerization degree (up to 15,000 units), and an intricate network of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups, contributing to the complexity of LCB (Chaudhary et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2014). The cellulose crystallinity can inhibit enzyme digestion and impede glucose release. In contrast, the amorphous hemicellulose fraction is not particularly recalcitrant to hydrolysis. It is the second largest polysaccharide in LCB, and it is a branched heteropolymers of C5 and C6 sugars, and acts as a glue between cellulose and lignin, adding structure to the overall biomass matrix. Both cellulose and hemicellulose are valuable resources of fermentable sugars accessible only after LCB fractionation (Quereshi et al., 2020). The composition of hemicellulose can vary among plant species. In grass and hardwood, hemicellulose is mainly composed of xylose, while in softwood plants is commonly a glucomannan polymer (Moore & Hatfield, 1994).  On the other hand, the lignin fraction primarily contributes to the recalcitrance of LCB. Lignin is a three-dimensional macromolecule comprising sinapyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol, commonly referred to as monolignols, interconnected via C-O-C and C–C linkages (Betts et al., 1991). Cellulose microfibrils, hemicellulose and lignin are interlocked with one other through covalent and non-covalent bonds. The hydrophobic association between cell-wall polysaccharides and lignin is important barrier that protects plant cell against external agents.  Despite their promising potential, the exploitation of LCBs presents a major technical challenge: the complex and recalcitrant structure of lignocellulose prevents the release of fermentable sugars. Therefore, pretreatment is the first step in any bioprocess that intend to use LCB. The optimal pretreatment method aimed at: 1) deconstruct lignin, increase porosity of cellulose, depolymerize hemicellulose, create accessible sites for enzymatic hydrolysis of the biomass; 2) release some fermentable monomeric sugars; 3) avoid formation of inhibitory compounds; 4) require low energy and low costs; 5) allow reuse of chemicals. Different pretreatment methods have been developed to these aims.    20 1.2 LCBs pretreatments Pretreatment methods have been broadly classified into physical pretreatment (milling, microwave, ultrasound, and pyrolysis), chemical pretreatment (acid, alkali, ozonolysis, and organic solvent, ionic liquids), physicochemical (hot water, steam explosion, ammonia based, wet oxidation, and CO2 explosion) or biological pretreatment (with enzymes or microorganisms).  Most of the traditional pretreatment methods (acids and alkali) have disadvantages including the release of the degradation products, lack of selectivity, low sugar yields, lower process efficiency, and higher processing costs. The new the new methods are the CO2 explosion are open the lignocellulosic structure, avoiding sugar loss.  Milling pretreatment or particle-size reduction is used to increase the surface area availability for the enzymes to access cellulose and hemicellulose. It reduces cellulose crystallinity and decreases hemicellulose polymerization. However, this method needs to be coupled with other pretreatments to have a higher degradation of lignin. Much more effective result to be microwave irradiation of biomass (Ooshima et al., 1984). This method utilizes thermal and non-thermal effect generated by microwave in aqueous environment exploiting biomass moisture. Microwaves causes fragmentation and swelling of the biomass, leading to degradation of lignin and hemicellulose (Puligundla et al., 2016).  On the other hand, most of chemical and physical-chemical pretreatment result to be more aggressive on the biomass, leading to lignin solubilization and formation of a highly digestible pretreated solid residue.  Acid pretreatment relies on utilization of diluted acid, mainly sulfuric acid, for the disruption of lignin structure and the depolymerization of amino hemicellulose to obtain a pretreated biomass, mainly composed of cellulose, and a hemicellulosic hydrolysate, rich in C5-sugars (Saha et al., 2005). In the hydrolysate generated through acid hydrolysis, phenolic compounds from lignin break-down can also found (Hsu et al., 2010). The conditions for acid pretreatment can vary in terms of solid load, reaction time and temperature (120°C-215°C) (Qin et al., 2018). The efficiency of the method depends on operational condition and biomass susceptibility (Vollmer et al., 2022).  A more direct action on lignin fraction can be obtained using alkaline pretreatment, which breaks down the linkages between lignin and the other biomass fractions, allowing accessibility to sugar within cellulosic and hemicellulose and disruption of lignin (Bali et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2008). The severeness of the method depends on the base utilized. In this pretreatment are  21 commonly used calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide (Park & Kim, 2012). The bottleneck of chemical pretreatments is the disposal of the solvents (Singh et al., 2015). For this reason, hydrothermal pretreatment and steam explosion are preferred due to the use of water but these methods are still unattractive, because of high utility costs related to water heating. The two processes are applied at 160°C-240°C in high pressure reactors (Duque et al., 2016). The big advantages of steam explosion the formation of a concentrated sugars hydrolysate, the limited use of chemicals, while the limitations include incomplete lignin disruption partial breakdown of hemicellulose fraction (Grous et al., 1986; Auxenfans et al., 2017). Carbon dioxide explosion is a relatively recent technology, comparable to steam pretreatment, which involves the release of high-pressure CO2 in a batch reactor, forming carbonic acid to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis rates of the biomass (Ge et al., 2020). However, sugar yields from CO2 explosion are significantly lower than those achieved with steam pretreatment (Mussatto et al., 2021). A variation to CO2 explosion is supercritical CO2 extraction, gaining attention as a biomass pre-treatment solvent under moderate temperature and pressure conditions (Tc=304 K and Pc=73 bar) (Gu et al., 2013; Alinia et al., 2010;).  Lastly, another alternative to the already mentioned pretreatment methods is the use of enzymes from White-rot fungi (Janusz et al., 2013). These enzymes, named laccase and peroxidase, catalyze one-electron phenol oxidation to phenoxy radicals, disrupting lignin structure.  Each pretreatment has its own effect on the three fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. The mentioned pretreatments improve at different levels the digestibility of LCB and generate various degradation products from cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Most of these by-products have an inhibitory effect on microorganism used to ferment sugars from biomass.  1.2.1 Inhibitory compounds generated during pretreatment  During biomass pretreatment processes, harsh conditions, such as high temperature and high pressure, cause the formation of inhibitory compounds affecting the fermentation hosts, weakening their growth and lowering their productivity (Palmqvist & Hahn-Hägerdal, 2000).  The most commonly inhibitors found belong to three categories, weak acid, furans, and phenolic compounds (Thomsen et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2006). The toxicity levels of these compounds have been extensively studied on microorganisms used in fermenting processes for 2G bioethanol production (Klike et al., 2003). The performance of biomass hydrolysate as  22 fermentation media depends on its chemical composition and the concentrations of inhibitory compounds dissolved in the media.  From lignin are generated aromatic compounds (Sakakibara & Sano, 2000) and polyphenolic derivatives, such as p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, gallic acid, vanillin and other. Sugar liberated from cellulose and hemicellulose can be degraded to furan aldehydes, such as 5- hydroxymethylfurfural acid (5-HMF) from hexose and furfural from pentose, and subsequently to weak aliphatic acid, such as formic from furfural and 5-HMF break-down and levulinic acid from 5-HMF degradation only (Larsson et al., 1999; Jilani et al., 2023) Weak acids in their undissociated form can diffuse across the membrane, and once in the cell lead to a decrease in cytosolic pH and inhibit cell growth (McLaughlin & Dilger, 1980). If during fermentation pH is increased the microorganism can initiate growth. Indeed, low pH inhibits cell proliferation also without weak acid, due to increased passive proton uptake (Casey et al., 2010). The presence of acetic, formic, and levulinic acid in the fermentation media has been correlated to low ethanol yield (Ullah et al., 2012). It has been hypothesized that cell growth inhibition could be due to loss of energy (as ATP), consequently to the activation of ATPs to pumps out of the cell the excess of proton. At high acid concentrations, the proton pumping capacity of the cell is exhausted, resulting in depletion of the ATP content (Pena et al., 2015). Additionally weak acid acts on glycosylic enzymes inhibiting their activity. The inhibition of glycolytic enzymes was observed in vitro in a fermentation medium with furfural, which may directly inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), contributing to long lag-phase during growth (Modig et al., 2002). Similar to furfural, 5-HMF causes a longer lag-phase, lower membrane permeability, and affect aminoacid biosynthesis (Li et al., 2022). As well as for furan aldehydes, the inhibitory impact of phenolic compounds, particularly low molecular weight ones, on lignocellulosic hydrolysate fermentation is attributed to their partitioning into biological membranes, leading to a loss of membrane integrity and impairing their role as selective barriers and enzyme matrices (Figueiredo et al., 2008; Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2012; Morrison et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2018). The interaction between acetic acid (10 g/L) and furfural (3 g/L) is characterized by a greater decrease in the specific growth rate (μ) than the sum of the individual decreases caused by each compound (Palmqvist et al., 1999). This result shows that the effect of degradative by-product generated during pretreatment is largely related to the synergic result of their individual inhibition.   23 Specific detoxification methods have been developed for efficient removal of inhibitors prior to fermentation of strongly inhibiting hydrolysates. A successful fermentation of LCB relays on bacterial growth, sugars uptake rate and product formation rate. These three factors are collectively related to the presence of inhibitory compound in the fermentation broth; thus, pretreatment is most of the time followed by a detoxification process.  1.2.2 Detoxification processes to mitigate inhibitor effects in fermentation  The detoxification method can be classified as physical, chemical, and biological. Evaporation and membrane filtration are the most common physical method for removal of inhibitors from lignocellulosic biomasses (Bhatia et al., 2020). Vacuum evaporation is often employed to eliminate volatile compounds, such as acetic acid, furfural, and vanillin (van Walsum, 2013). However, the use of this technology may lead to concentration of other inhibitory compounds that are less volatile but could be more toxic (Coz et al., 2016). On the other hand, filtration through microporous membranes or nanofiltration, employing a pressure-driven process, can effectively remove compounds like formic acid, ferulic acid, and 5-HMF, utilizing a molecular weight cutoff of 100 g/mol (Nguyen et al., 2015; Abels et al., 2013). However, it is essential to note that these membranes exhibit high selectivity for specific compounds, making complete removal of inhibitors from lignocellulosic hydrolysate challenging (Chandel et al., 2013). Achieving total inhibitor removal may require the combination of membranes with different cutoffs. In industrial applications, alternative methods may be preferable due to potential high utility costs (Chandel et al., 2011).  Other methods include alkaline and iron ion exchange detoxification, charcoal absorbance and calcium carbonate neutralization. Alkaline detoxification with the NaOH allows the precipitation of phenolic compounds from lignin and furan aldehydes (Palmqvist et al., 2000). Using ion exchange resins, the liquid hydrolysates pass through absorbing resins that interact with inhibitory compounds involving weak chemical bonds (Nilvebrant et al., 2001). Uncharged exchanger can remove only phenolic compounds and furan by weak hydrophobic interactions, while cationic resins have a negative charge and are not able to remove these compounds. Instead, the absorbance with activated charcoal has affinity for vanillic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, furfural, acetic acid, sulfuric acid and xylose in this order (Arminda et al., 2021). Therefore, this method can cause partial sugar loss which is undesirable for  24 fermentation. The main bottleneck of these chemical processes are the cost and the need of additional solvents disposal step (Wang & Feng, 2010).  Biological methods of detoxification rely on microorganisms and enzyme for removal of specific inhibitors. The specificity and efficiency of the process are completely related to the individual abilities of the used microorganisms and the substrates-affinity of the enzymes (Mpabanga et al., 2012). Both methods are eco-friendly. The use of enzymes can incur high costs; hance, the exploitation of the natural ability of some microorganisms to metabolize inhibitory compounds as can be more convenient.  Bacterial species belonging to various the genera Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Bacillus, Vibrio, Marinobacter, Comamonas, Micrococcus, Sphingomonas, Alcaligenes, Streptomyces, Burkholderia, Polaromonas, and Ralstonia, among others, have been reported to utilize aromatic compounds as a carbon source through aerobic and/or anaerobic processes (Phale et al., 2020).  1.2.3 Microorganisms for lignocellulose-derived inhibitory compounds bioremediation Microbial detoxification has gathered significant attention due to the broad range of substrate specificity of microorganisms and ecofriendly nature of the technique. Numerous bacteria across different genera have been found to carry genes involved in the pathways for the metabolism of inhibitory compounds derived from lignin. Typically isolated from soil or decaying wood residues, these bacteria preserve in their genomes the necessary genes enabling them to thrive in their ecological niches. In a study by Lopez et al., (2003), five bacteria, Methylobacterium extorquens, Pseudomonas sp, Flavobacterium indologenes, Acinetobacter sp., Arthrobacter aurescens, and one fungus, Coniochaeta ligniaria were isolated from soil. These microorganisms were selected for the ability to grow in a defined mineral medium containing a mixture of ferulic acid (5 mM), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF, 15 mM), and furfural (20 mM) as the carbon and energy sources. Among those, C. ligniaria demonstrated high efficiency in eliminating furfural and 5-HMF when grown in corn stover hydrolysate. This ability is highly valuable for detoxification of lignocellulosic hydrolysate.  In another contest, it was demonstrated that Bacillus sp. can decolorized and reduce by 65% Kraft Lignin content in presence of glucose within 6 days of incubation (Raj et al., 2007). Indeed, Bacillus sp. carry a vast cluster of genes involved in the phenolic degradation pathways. Specifically, the phenyl acrylic acid decarboxylase1 (PAD1) of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was successfully introduced in E. coli to convert p-coumaric acid in p-Hydroxystyrene (pHS), a  25 monomer for the production of polymers and a petroleum-based feedstock for resins, elastomers, adhesives (Chang et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2013).  The bacterial enzymology of lignin-degraders is still uncovered but most of these bacteria express extracellular peroxidase and laccases (Bugg et al., 2011). These oxygenases are used to incorporate either one or two atoms of molecular oxygen (O2) into the substrate, leading to ring hydroxylation and/or ring cleavage of phenolic compounds (Ullrich & Hofrichter et al., 2007). Other candidates for phenols detoxification could be the bacteria belonging to Burkholderia genus. The lignolytic ability of Burkholderia sp CCA53 was assessed by observing its growth on medium containing alkali lignin or lignin-associated aromatic monomers as the sole carbon source (Akita et al., 2016). Instead, Streptomyces albogriseus is able to grow on coniferyl alcohol and other aromatics as vanillic, trans-cinnamic, caffeic and ferulic acids as sole carbon sources (Buraimoh et al., 2017).  Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, as Pseudomonas putida KT2440, are prominent bacteria widely used for various biotechnological applications. The growing interest on these bacteria is related to their high genetic plasticity, higher resistance to harmful chemicals and their ability to metabolized by products from biomass degradation. For example, strain NGC7 was grown in lignin-derived phenols to produce cis,cis-muconate (ccMA), a platform chemical for synthesis of a variety of polymers including nylon (Shinoda et al, 2019). In some cases, the microbial natural abilities were improved via adaptive laboratory evolution, as in the case of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 for ferulate. The adapted strain was then used to produce 1-undecene from ferulate, as the sole carbon source (Luo et al., 2019). The diverse metabolic capabilities of these microorganisms highlight their potential for lignocellulose-derived compound metabolism, underscoring the broad applications of microbial detoxification strategies in industrial and environmental settings.  1.3 Co-cultivation strategy  Bacterial co-cultivation involves the simultaneous growth of two or more bacteria. The main advantage of co-cultivation is the establishment of synergistic metabolism:  different bacterial strains, each with unique metabolic pathways, can complement each other and enhance substrate utilization. Conversely, a significant drawback arises from challenges in establishing effective co-cultivation, primarily due to potential conflicts such as resource competition or differing environmental needs (i. e., temperature, pH, or oxygenation).  26  In industrial biotechnology, the need of performing complex reactions has determined the growing interest for synthetic microbial consortia (Qian et al., 2020). These are designed mixtures of microorganisms chosen for their complementary functions. In fermentation processes, the synergistic metabolism and diversified roles within the consortium enable enhanced substrate utilization, ultimately improving bio-commodity production. Additionally, microbial communities are more robust and versatile in facing environmental challenges, providing advantages over monocultures. For the effective utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, establishing a consortium with bacteria capable of utilizing both non-sugar carbon sources (like lignin) and sugar-carbon sources could enable the complete exploitation of the biomass. In this way, it will be possible to use co-cultivation to simultaneously detoxify the fermentation medium form the inhibitors derived from the biomass and ferment its sugars. A consortium of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida cantarelli with specific functions was employed to enhance bioethanol production from pretreated biomass (Kamal et al., 2022); and an engineered strains of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 was used in a consortium with a thermotolerant yeast, Kluyveromyces marxianus to degrade benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate in a fermentation for ethanol production (Singh et al., 2019).  Inter-communication within microbial consortia is a very complex. Bacteria can communicate between each other in different ways. Microbes utilize signal compounds and small peptides in quorum sensing-mediated (QS) chemical communication (Waters & Bassler, 2005). This mechanism is employed for spatial-temporal communication and regulate microbial consortia dynamics. These small signal peptides are released in the extracellular environment where they reach membrane receptors or diffusion in the other cell, and once inside the cell, complex network of genes involved in the cell metabolism can be activated or repressed to respond to the external stimulus. Communication may involve membrane vesicles fusing, where metabolite-loaded vesicles move from a sender cell to a receptor cell and merge with the membrane (Toyofuku et al., 2019). Alternatively, communication can be enriched through horizontal gene transfer, where genetic material is exchanged between distinct bacteria (Arnold et al., 2022).  Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), integrating lignocellulose degradation, hydrolysis, and fermentation, is a promising approach for biomass conversion (Periyasamy et al., 2023). However, finding a microorganism capable of all tasks is challenging. Microbial consortia-based bioprocessing, employing multiple microorganisms with complementary functions, offers a viable alternative, dividing complex tasks and enhancing efficiency in biomass  27 conversion. In a stable microbial consortium of Trichoderma reesei and Lactobacilli sp., 19.8 g/L lactic acid was obtained from non-detoxified beech wood, exploiting degradative-enzymes production of T. reesei and lactic acid production ability of the bacillus (Shahab et al., 2018). T. reesei was also used in polyculture with S. cerevisiae and Scheffersomyces stipitis could achieve cellulolytic enzyme production, C5-C6 sugars utilization and ethanol production at once from non-detoxified dilute acid slurry of wheat straw (Brethauer & Studer, 2014).  Creating synthetic microbial consortia remains in its early stages, often involving a 2 or 3 wild-type or engineered microorganisms. The construction of more complex consortia still requires expanded knowledge, as well as their stability is yet a challenge. Microorganisms within consortia can exhibit diverse growth conditions and substrate competition, therefore the synchronization of their cultivation is obtained with non-optimal adjusted conditions.  In this thesis bacterial consortia are used in the fermentation of pretreated Brewer’s spent grain, to alleviate medium toxicity with a bacterium devoted to metabolizing inhibitors and to efficiently convert sugars to product. Inoculum size and timing of the two bacteria are also studied to adjust population structure.   1.4 Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) comprises the seed coat, husk, and the pericarp layers that covered the barley grains (Mussatto et al., 2006). BSG represents 85% of the total solid residues generated during the brewing process, and every 100 L of beer produced, around 20 kg of wet BSG are obtained as by-products (Jockowski et al., 2020). The chemical composition of BSG varies based on factors such as barley variety, harvest time, and variations in the beer production procedures (Gupta et al., 2010). Generally, BSG is biomass rich in protein and fiber, 20% and 70%, respectively (He et al., 2019). The primary components of these fibrous tissues are arabinoxylan, lignin, and cellulose, in addition to fiber 24-30% of protein, 3-5% of lipids, and 1-4% ash are found in oven-dried BSG.  BSG also contains minerals, vitamins, and amino acids. Mineral elements such as calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur are present in concentrations below 0.5% (Mussatto et al., 2006). Vitamins in BSG include biotin, folic acid, thiamine, and others. While protein-bound amino acids, such as leucine, valine, alanine, serine, glycine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid, are found in larger amounts (Wen et al., 2019). Thus, due to this chemical composition, BSG has high value as a raw material. Until now, the main application of BSG has been as an animal feed for ruminants due to its high content of protein  28 and fiber and high nutritional value (Ikram et al., 2017; Jaeger et al., 2021). For the same reason, it has been proposing to include BSG in human diet as food ingredient (Lynch et al., 2016).  On the other hand, pyrolysis and combustion have been explored to harness the significant net calorific values of BSG (18.64 MJ kg−1 dry mass) but the high moisture content of BSG makes these processes unsustainable and energy-demanding (Mahmood et al., 2013). In the request for sustainable thermal energy sources, biogas production from BSG has emerged as a viable option (Čater et al., 2015). The composition of the biogas comprises approximately 55–65% methane, 30–45% carbon dioxide, traces of hydrogen sulfide, and fractions of water vapor. In this case, the production of biogas from BSG is challenged by formation lignocellulosic biodegradation products such as p-cresol that inhibits methanogens activities (Sežun et al., 2011). While, biogas production is limited to larger breweries, BSG's role in ethanol production has garnered attention, capitalizing on its hemicellulose and cellulose fractions.  An impressive 86.3% ethanol conversion efficiency was achieved from xylose-rich hemicellulosic hydrolysate, obtained through dilute acid hydrolysis of BSG with Pichia stipites (Meneses et al., 2013). Notably, BSG distinguishes itself by supporting fermentation without the need for nutrient supplementation. While ethanol production from cellulose in BSG requires pre-treatment, various studies exploring different conditions underscore BSG's significant potential (Liguori et al., 2015). A consolidated bioconversion process, conducted under microaerobic conditions, achieved a yield of 65 g kg−1 dry BSG by Fusarium oxysporum (Xiros & Christakopoulos, 2009). A patented method introduces acid and heat pre-treatment, enzyme hydrolysis, fermentation, distillation, and ethanol dehydration for fuel ethanol production from BSG. This multi-step approach highlights the versatility of BSG as a feedstock for advanced biofuel production (Birkmire et al., 2010).  Beyond its role in energy production, BSG plays a crucial role in fermentation processes, offering sugar-rich hydrolysate produced from acid hydrolysis, fostering the production of valuable compounds, such as xylitol, lactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoates (Mussatto et al., 2005; Patel et al., 2018; Corchodo-Lopo et al., 2021). Acid and hydrothermal hydrolysis are employed to unlock compounds like glucose, xylose, and arabinose, while alkaline hydrolysis efficiently solubilizes lignin (Wilkinson et al., 2014). Moreover, BSG's antioxidant phenolic compounds, recoverable through solvent extraction, present an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic antioxidants (McCarthy et al., 2013; Moreira et al., 2013). This dual functionality positions BSG as a versatile resource for both energy and chemical applications. The various  29 application and their limitations underscore the potential of BSG as a sustainable and valuable byproduct as well as the need of further investigations on BSG utilization.   1.5 Paenibacillus spp. The genus Paenibacillus (from latin paene = almost) include over 239 well-characterized Gram-positive species distributed in a wide range of environments, from ocean sediments to dry soil, thus most of those are often associated to roots as part of rhizosphere of various plants (Grady et al., 2016). For their rod-shape and the ability to form endospores for long time the species of Paenibacillus were included in the genus Bacillus, however, in early 1990s with the phylogenetic classification derived from 16S rRNA gene sequencing the genus Paenibacillus and P. polymyxa was defined the type-strain (Ash et al., 1991; Ash et al., 1991). Apart from the morphology the two genera share also more than 89.6 % 16S rRNA sequence similarity (Shida et al., 1997).  As rhizobacteria, Paenibacillus spp., conserve in their genome genes encoding for essential enzymes for the biosynthesis of indole-3 acetic acid, the most abundant auxins found in nature, that regulates plat gene expression and promotes plant growth (Mei et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2016). Soil inoculation with P. polymyxa is used to promote root growth and improve soil habitat through bacteria-mediated nitrogen fixation and phosphorus solubilization (Xie et al., 2014; Timmusk & Wagner, 1999; Mohd Din et al., 2020). Moreover, Paenibacillus spp. have evolved a large gene-set that encodes for antimicrobial agents to suppress plant pathogens being them bacteria, fungi, or pest insects. The Paenibacillus bacteria syntheses chitinases for exoskeletons hydrolysis, anti-pest Cry proteins, glucanases, cellulases, mannanases and amylases against pathogenic fungi (Poria et al., 2021; Yokoyama et al., 2004; Nielsen & Sørensen, 1997; Soni et at., 2021). Paenibacillus species also conserve genes for production of polymyxin A and B (colistin) the last resort against multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens (Velkov et al., 2010; Naghmouchi et al., 2012). In the genus Paenibacillus there are also pathogenic strains, as P. larvae that can rapidly proliferates in the midgut and breaches the epithelium of honeybee larvae and causes their death (Ebeling et al., 2016).  In recent times, the non-pathogenic variant P. polymyxa has gained significant appeal in the biotechnological industry as a production platform for bulk chemicals. Paenibacillus spp. exhibit the capability to produce substantial quantities of 2,3-R,R-butanediol with exceptionally high enantiomeric purity, adding to their attractiveness in this context (Häßler et al., 2012; Okonkwo et al., 2017). This thesis uses P. polymyxa in consortium with other bacteria  30 to develop technology for the valorization of brewer’s spent grains (BSG) through production of 2,3-BDO.   1.6 2,3-Butanediol 2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BDO) is a versatile platform chemical mostly derived from petroleum with a long history of research in its biotechnological production (Zeng & Sabra, 2011; Fulmer at al., 1933). 2,3-BDO is widely applied in different industries due to its chemical plasticity related to its three stereoisomers: levo-BDO (R,R-BDO), dextro-BDO (S,S-BDO) and meso-BDO (R,S- BDO) (Kandasamy et al., 2016; Syu 2001). The high commercial value of 2,3-BDO is represented by its global market size valued at US$ 270.4 Mn (million), and projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.5% in the next 8 years (from 2023 to 2031) and reach US$ 363.9 Mn by the end of 2031 (https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/2-3-butanediol-market.html). The commercial value of 2,3-BDO is calculated also considering the market of its derivatives, such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), which is formed by dehydration of 2,3-BDO and is used as a fuel additive or solvent for resins and lacquers (Torres-Vinces et al., 2020; Celińska & Grajek, 2009). The low freezing point of 2,3-BDO (-60 °C) makes it suitable for use as an anti-freezing agent (Białkowska,2016), while the boiling point ranges between 177 °C to 182 °C determines the high cost of distillation process (Mailaram et al., 2022). Consequently, the downstream-processing represents a major bottleneck in the 2,3-BDO production, therefore research focused on enhancing the product yield to lower the impact of costs in the process (Koutinas et al., 2016). Klebsiella pneumoniae achieved the highest product titer exceeding 150 g/L in fed-batch fermentations (Ma et al., 2009), while Serratia marcescens reached a maximum of 139.9 g/L in optimization of process conditions (Zhang et al., 2010). However, both bacteria are highly pathogenic, and the attention of biotechnology for industrial production of 2,3-BDO goes for bacteria with generally recognized as safe status (GRAS), such as P. polymyxa. This bacterium can produce highly pure R,R-butanediol (98%) with any genetic manipulation (Nakashimada et al., 1998).  In a study of Okonkwo et al. (2017), it was reported the production 111 g/L 2,3-BDO using a high nutritional media containing 60 g/L yeast extract. Despite the impressive production titer, the application of cheap feedstock is preferred over industrially unfeasible nutrients to reduce production costs.   31 1.6.1 Biosynthesis of 2,3-BDO  The biosynthesis pathways of 2,3-butanediol in microorganisms mostly dependent on oxygen availability and the maintenance of redox balance under microaerobic conditions. 2,3-BDO is produced starts from 2 moles of pyruvate, generated through glycolysis from one mole of glucose (Figure 1) (Lee et al., 2021). Following that, two moles of pyruvate form α-acetolactate, which then undergoes decarboxylation to produce acetoin, which is further reduced to butanediol, simultaneously regenerating one redox equivalent of NAD+ (Bloem et al., 2016). In anaerobic or microaerobic conditions to maintain the NAD+/NADH equilibrium, the excessive NADH from glycolysis is oxidized via by-products, such as ethanol, lactate or formate (Maina et al., 2022).   Depending on oxygen availability, acetolactate synthase compete with other enzymes for the intermediate pyruvate to determine the end products. The enzyme pyruvate formate lyase converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which is the intermediate of the reactions catalyzed by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase (Knappe & Sawers, 1990). These reactions form two moles of NAD+ resulting in a net gain of one redox equivalent per mole of pyruvate, which helps compensate for the redox imbalance in 2,3-BDO biosynthesis. While substantial knowledge has been acquired on microorganism produce 2,3-BDO, a precise rationale behind bacterial choice among the different pyruvate destinies remains unclear. It has been proposed that 2,3-BDO serves as pyruvate drainer to avoid elevated acidification of the intracellular environment. Indeed, it was found that supplementation of acetic acid to the fermentation medium increased 2,3-BDO biosynthesis (Van Houdt et al., 2007). Hence, the predominant strategies for enhancing 2,3-BDO production involves redirecting carbon flux towards 2,3-BDO or overexpressing genes associated with it formation. Jung et al. (2012) attenuated lactate accumulation while improved 2,3-BDO yield via deletion of a lactate dehydrogenase in Enterobacter aerogenes, instead Yang et al. (2013) obtained the same result in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens by overexpression of butanediol dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase. In the case of P. polymyxa, due to low availability of genetic engineering tools for this strain, most research focus on the optimization of process parameters and media composition (Okonkwo et al., 2017).   32  Figure 1.

Mussatto)  ABSTRACT The utilization of lignocellulosic biomasses in fermentation processes typically requires a pretreatment step to release sugars. However, this process also generates compounds potentially toxic for the microorganisms. While various methods for detoxifying fermentation media exist, these techniques often lead to an incomplete removal of certain inhibitory compounds, besides resulting in an undesirable sugar loss and additional costs. In this work, microbial detoxification is explored as a more economically viable solution to overcome the toxicity of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Six bacteria, Pseudomonas alloputida DSM 6125, Rhodococcus sp. DSM 43001, Bacillus coagulans DSM 2314, Corynebacterium glutamicum DSM 20300, Acinetobacter radioresistens DSM 6976, and Burkholderia xenovorans DSM 17367 were selected and their ability to thrive in brewer’s spent grain hemicellulosic hydrolysates, which were rich in sugars and inhibitory compounds, was assessed. Among those strains, P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. were also cultivated in minimal medium containing inhibitory compounds as sole carbon source to assess their metabolic skills and tolerance to furan aldehydes and lignin-derived phenolics. P. alloputida demonstrated exceptional tolerance and complete transformation of several compounds. In M9 medium supplemented with a cocktail of inhibitors (5 mM vanillin, 5 mM ferulic acid, 5 mM p-coumaric acid, 1 mM 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and 10 mM furfural), P. alloputida proficiently utilized these molecules as sole carbon source, exceeding OD (600) 7.   Keywords: Pseudomonas alloputida; Rhodococcus sp.; Bacillus coagulans; Corynebacterium glutamicum; Acinetobacter radioresistens; Burkholderia xenovorans; Brewer’s spent grain, lignin-derived phenolic compound; microbial detoxification.   47 2.1 Introduction  Lignocellulosic biomass comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin organized in a complex structure. Cellulose is a linear polymer of D-glucose microfibrils linked to form crystalline regions. Hemicellulose, a branched heteropolymer, includes pentose sugars (xylose and arabinose), hexoses (mannose, glucose, and galactose), and acetylated sugars. Lignin, an amorphous phenolic polymer, arises from phenyl-propane alcohols, forming syringyl, guaiacyl, and p-hydroxyl phenol units (Fengel & Wegener, 1984). The intricate binding among these constituents contributes to the biomass’s recalcitrance (Yousuf et al., 2019). Biotechnology aims to establish biorefineries for microbial fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass. However, effective utilization demands for pretreatment to disassemble lignin, breakdown hemicellulose, diminish cellulose crystallinity, enhance biomass porosity, and liberate monomeric sugars for fermentation (Mussatto & Teixeira, 2010; Chen et al., 2013). An ideal pretreatment should be cost-effective, adaptable to various biomasses, minimize sugar loss and inhibitor formation, ensuring lignin removal (Jönsson & Martín, 2016). Currently, no single technique satisfies all these criteria.  Various pretreatment methods yield distinct inhibitory compounds in hemicellulosic hydrolysates. Furfural and 5-HMF commonly arise from pentoses and hexoses sugars via dehydration reactions. In an acidic condition, furfural can covalently bind to macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA, leading to reactive oxygen species accumulation. This damages mitochondrial membranes, nuclear chromatin, and the actin cytoskeleton, compromising cell vitality (Kang et al., 2018; Sjulander & Kikas, 2020; Travaini et al., 2016). Due to its high hydrophobicity, 5-HMF may induce enzyme inhibition, loss of membrane integrity, resulting in cell function alterations (Malav et al., 2017; van der Maas et al., 2021). In acid thermochemical pretreatments, further degradation of furan aldehydes generates formic acid, while levulinic acid derives from 5-HMF only (Mussatto & Teixeira, 2010; Kang et al., 2018). Intracellularly, these aliphatic acids induce anion accumulation at pH 7, potentially inhibiting crucial enzymes (Pienkos & Zhang, 2009).  On the other hand, lignin degradation produces phenolic compounds such as ferulic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and others (Liu et al., 2021). These phenolic compounds are generally toxic, impacting microbial membranes, disrupting mitochondrial function, and inducing oxidative stress and DNA damage (Jönsson et al., 2013; van der Maas et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021).   48 Achieving successful fermentation of sugars requires extensive knowledge on how phenolic compounds and other pretreatment-derived molecules inhibit the process, calling for their selective removal from the hydrolysates.  Various methods aim at minimizing inhibitors presence, however complete removal remains elusive due to factors such as inhibitors’ properties, i.e., size, polarity, reactivity, and concentration. Detoxification methods for hemicellulosic hydrolysates are currently challenged by low efficiency, prolonged operational time, high costs, undesired sugar loss, and environmental concerns (Chandel et al., 2013). Common techniques involve physical-chemical methods, such as overliming, activated charcoal adsorption, and ion exchange resins, as well as biological approaches like enzymatic treatment or microbial adaptation (Mussatto & Roberto, 2004; Pan et al., 2019; Sjulander & Kikas, 2020; Zhang et al., 2018).  Alternatively, in situ detoxification employs microorganisms adapted to degrade specific inhibitors, transforming harmful substances into less toxic intermediates, or utilizing them as a carbon sources (Jönsson et al., 2013; Zha et al., 2014; Bhatia et al., 2019). Different bacteria exhibit Rhodococcus opacus DSM 1069 and PD630 can convert lignin model compounds into citric acid cycle metabolites, generating energy for triacylglycerols (TAGs) production (Wang et al., 2014). Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 exhibits distinct pathways for p-coumaric and ferulic acid degradation, promoting cell growth through the β-ketoadipate pathway (Chen & Wan, 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Pseudomonas species utilizes various lignin-derived aromatics, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillin, ferulic acid as exclusive carbon and energy sources (Ravi et al., 2017). Morya et al. (2021) studied polyhydroxyalkanoate production by a Burkholderia strain in mineral media enriched with lignin-derived inhibitors, noticing growth on vanillin, ferulic, and p-coumaric acids as sole carbon sources. Donoso et al. (2021) cultivated potential furan aldehyde degraders, including B. xenovorans LB400, on derivatives of these compounds as carbon sources, observing growth on intermediates but not on 5-HMF. Koopman et al. (2010) proposed degradation pathways for 5-HMF and furfural in Cupriavidus basilensis. These aldehydes undergo oxidation to acids, followed by decarboxylation to produce 2-furoic acid, subsequently converted to 2-furoyl-CoA, integrating the TCA cycle via 2-oxo-glutarate (Guarnieri et al., 2017; Wierckx et al., 2011). Extensive research explored Bacillus coagulans cultivation in biomass hydrolysates for lactic acid production (van der Pol et al., 2016). Some of these studies maximized lactic acid yield investigating the impact of lignocellulose-related inhibitory compounds on microbial performance (Ouyang et al., 2020). Cubas-Cano et al. (2020) and Fu et al. (2023) asses complete conversion of furfural and 5-HMF to their alcohol forms by B. coagulans, consistently with findings from other works (Jiang et al., 2016; Yan et  49 al., 2018). Discrepancies arise regarding aromatic compound degradation: while Cubas-Cano et al. (2020) noted complete conversion of vanillin and syringaldehyde in defined media, Fu et al. (2023) observed significant consumption (over 50%) of these compounds but did not report their complete depletion. Corynebacterium glutamicum capability to metabolize benzoate, vanillin, p-coumaric and ferulic acids is also recognized (Kallscheuer et al., 2016, 2018, 2016*; Lin et al., 2022; Mhatre et al., 2022). Strain tolerance for lignin-derived inhibitory compounds was enhanced via adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE), resulting in notably higher glutamate production in hydrolysate (Wang et al.,2018). Moreover, Acinetobacter radioresistens S13 strain utilizes benzoate or phenol as sole carbon and energy sources via the β-ketoadipate pathway (Mazzoli et al.; 2007). Other Acinetobacter strains degrade compounds like 4-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate (Barbe et al., 2004; Fischer et al., 2008). It is notable that the degradation of inhibitory compounds in hydrolysates is highly complex due to the wide and diverse range of molecules, leading to potential cross-inhibition (Wang et al., 2014).  This work evaluated the detoxification strength of six bacteria, Pseudomonas alloputida DSM 6125, Rhodococcus sp. DSM 43001, Bacillus coagulans DSM 2314, Corynebacterium glutamicum DSM 20300, Acinetobacter radioresistens DSM 6976 and Burkholderia xenovorans DSM 17367, in relation to hemicellulosic hydrolysate derived from Brewer’s spent grain (BSG), a scarcely valorized by-product of beer industry. Two out of six of these bacteria were further studied for their ability to metabolize some of the most frequent lignocellulose-derived inhibitors as sole carbon source, to propose these strains for bioremediation of a broader range of hydrolysates. In this work, the utilization of the three hydrolysates aimed to assess bacterial performance under the influence of inhibitors present in the hydrolysates. The interest is on understanding whether the tested microorganisms exhibit the capacity to tolerate and thrive despite increased inhibitor levels. The investigation into microbial responses to inhibitors within H155 and H195 holds significant implications, shedding light on the adaptability and resilience of these microorganisms in the context of potential industrial-scale fermentative processes. The outcomes could provide valuable insights into microbial tolerance mechanisms and guide strategies for optimizing bioconversion processes utilizing hemicellulosic hydrolysates.   50 2.2 Materials and methods  2.2.1 Raw material Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) was generously supplied by Carlsberg Breweries located in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was comprised by barley malt (70%) and barley (30%). BSG was stored in a freeze at -80 ºC prior to use. Before pretreatment, the BSG underwent an oven-drying process at 60°C to reach a moisture level lower than 10%. Subsequently, it was subjected to milling and sieving, reducing the particle size to 1mm, followed by compositional analysis. 2.2.2 Preparation of hemicellulosic hydrolysates by diluted acid pretreatment   To generate three hemicellulosic hydrolysates from BSG, a dilute acid pretreatment of the raw material was carried out using a Parr reactor (Parr Instr. Co., IL, USA) with an internal volume of 600 mL. The pretreatment was performed at a solid-to-liquid ratio (SLR) of 1:8 (w/w), at the temperatures of 120 ºC, 155 ºC or 190 ºC for 17 min, using 1.25% (w/v) sulfuric acid. The reactions were properly halted by placing the reactor in an ice-water bath for 30 min. Following each pretreatment, the liquid-solid fractions were separated via screening, and the remaining slurries were subjected to a first round of centrifugation (8,000 g, 4 ºC, Sorvall Lynx 6000 Centrifuge) to eliminate residual solids.  The supernatants were then subjected to pH adjustment to 6.0, followed by another round of centrifugation under the same conditions to remove precipitants, and then vacuum filtrated. The clarified liquid fractions, hydrolysate prepared at 120 ºC (H120), at 155 ºC (H155), or at 190 ºC (H195), were analyzed for their sugar content (glucose, xylose, and arabinose) and for the presence of key lignocellulose-derived inhibitor compounds, such as acetic and formic acid, furfural, 5-HMF, and some phenolic compounds, i.e., p-coumaric, syringic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoyc aldehyde, vanillin, 4-hydrozybenzoyc acid, caffeic acid, syringaldehyde, ferulic acid, and acetovanillone. The liquid fractions were also filter-sterilized (20 µm vacuum PES filter units; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) to be used as fermentation media. 2.2.3 Microorganisms, cultivation conditions and fermentation media Six bacterial strains were used in this work: Pseudomonas alloputida DSM 6125, Rhodococcus sp. DSM 43001, Bacillus coagulans DSM 2314, Corynebacterium glutamicum  51 DSM 20300, Acinetobacter radioresistens DSM 6976 and Burkholderia xenovorans DSM 17367 from the German collection of microorganisms (DSMZ, Leibniz, Germany). Before use, the strains were stored at –80ºC as glycerol stock (40%).  They were cultivated in LB plates (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl and 16 g/L agar) at their optimum temperature overnight. Single colonies were used to initiate the pre-cultures in M9 minimal medium composed of: salt solution (12.8 g/L Na2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L NaCl, and 1 g/L NH4Cl), trace elements (0.05 g/L EDTA, 0.083 g/L FeCl3.6H2O, 0.084 mg/L ZnCl2, 0.013 mg/L CuCl2.2H2O, 0.01 mg/L CoCl2.6H2O, 0.01 mg/L HBO3, and 0.016 mg/L MnCl2.4H2O), 0.1 mM MgSO4, 0.01 mM CaCl2.2H2O, and 4% glucose. All the strains, except B. xenovorans, were grown in the three hemicellulosic hydrolysates derived from BSG pretreatment. B. xenovorans was cultivated only in the H120 hydrolysate. In all the hydrolysates, the bacteria were inoculated at an initial OD (600nm) of 0.05. Among the six microorganisms, two of them, Pseudomonas alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. were also cultivated in M9 minimal media where inhibitory compounds were added as sole carbon sources in lieu of glucose at appropriate concentrations.  The following inhibitory compounds were tested in M9 minimal medium: 5-HMF, furfural, vanillin, ferulic acid, p-coumaric, acid and syringic acid (from Sigma-Aldrich). Stock solutions of each inhibitor were prepared with ethanol (96%) to promote solubilization to have in the final media less the 2% of ethanol.  The pre-cultures and the cultivations in H120, H155, and H195 were performed on 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks in shaking incubator KS 4000i control (IKA, Germany) at 250 rpm and at the optimal temperature of each microorganism.  The experiments with inhibitory compounds were conducted in a flat-bottom 24-well microplate (VWR, Denmark) using a microplate reader SpectraMax® iD3 (Molecular Devices, USA) with a 1.5 ml final volume in each well, maintained at 30º C with orbital agitation for 48 h. Absorbance at 600 nm was measured every 20 min. All tests were performed in triplicate. Other experiments were performed using 250 mL shaking flasks, each containing 50 mL working volume. These experiments involved M9 with glucose, M9 with glucose supplemented with 2% ethanol, and two different variations of M9 lacking glucose supplemented with a cocktail of inhibitors referred to as inhibitors-cocktail-1 and inhibitors-cocktail-2. Inhibitors-cocktail-1 was enriched with 0.5 mM 5-HMF, 5 mM furfural, 2.5 mM p-coumaric, 2.5 mM ferulic acid and 2.5 mM vanillin. Instead, the inhibitors-cocktail-2 contained the same inhibitory compounds as cocktail-1 but concentrated 2-folds. For inhibitors-cocktail-1 and inhibitors-cocktail-2, the initial OD (600nm) sizes were set at 0.05 and 0.25, respectively,  52 while in the medium containing glucose or glucose supplemented with ethanol, the initial OD (600nm) conditions were 0.05. All media were sterilized via filtration using 0.2 μm vacuum PES filter units (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).  Absorbance values from the SpectraMax® iD3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA) were adjusted using a calibration curve to establish a relationship with standard OD values obtained from the ULTROSPEC® 10 CELL DENSITY METER spectrophotometer (Biochrom, UK). Cultures of Rhodococcus sp. and P. alloputida were grown in M9 medium with glucose in shaking flasks at 30º C/250 rpm. Subsequently, these cultures were diluted to create varying concentrations. One milliliter of each concentration was analyzed at 600 nm using the spectrophotometer, while 1.5 ml of the same samples were analyzed using the microplate reader. Calibration curves demonstrating significant R2 values were generated, and the derived equation was used to convert absorbance values into OD (600nm) values.  2.2.4 Analytical methods To determine the content of extractives, structural carbohydrates, lignin, and ash content in the BSG, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analytical methodology was applied (Sluiter et al., 2011, 2008, 2005). The total starch content was analyzed by the “Total Starch Assay Kit” method (Megazyme, Ireland), while total protein content was measured by the Kjeldahl acid digestion method (described in AOAC (1990) 955.04), applying 6.25 as conversion factor. The content of sugars (glucose, xylose, and arabinose) and inhibitory compounds (acetic acid, formic acid) in H120, H155 and H195 media, in M9 with glucose, and as well in fermentation samples, were determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatograph UHPLC plus focused system (Dionex Softron GmbH, Germering, Germany). A refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101) and a Bio-Rad Aminex column HPX-87H (300 mm × 7.8 mm) (at 60 ºC) were used, being 5 mM H2SO4 the mobile phase employed with a flow of 0.6 mL/min. For quantification of furan derivatives, 5-HMF, furfural, furfuryl alcohol and 2-furoic acid, and phenolic compounds, such as 4- hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, 4-hydroxbenzaldehyde, p-coumaric acid, vanillin, syringaldehyde, caffeic acid, gallic acid and ferulic acid, all the samples were filtered through a 0.2 µm cellulose acetate syringe filter. The analysis was carried out in the same HPLC system, but equipped with a Zorbax eclipse plus C18 column, eluted with gradient method with mobile phase 0.05 % acetic acid in water and acetonitrile, column oven at 30 °C, flow rate of 1 mL/min, a UV-Vis at 280  53 nm, and 8 µL of injection. Analytical determinations were carried out in triplicate and the average results are shown.   2.3 Results and discussion  2.3.1 Characterization of raw biomasses and the hemicellulosic hydrolysates  BSG used in this study was composed of 13.73% ± 0.35% cellulose, 16.26% ± 0.4% hemicellulose, 18.04% ± 0.88% lignin, 22.19% ± 1.09% extractives, 3.73% ± 0.14% ashes, 0,15% ± 0.01% acetyl groups, 9.62% ± 0.02% fat, and 1.61% ± 0.02% starch, on dry basis. This biomass was pretreated using diluted sulfuric acid to generate three hemicellulosic hydrolysates enriched in sugars, mainly glucose, xylose, and arabinose, together with other carbon sources. The differences in the composition of these hydrolysates (Table 1), H120, H155, and H195, are attributed to the variations in temperature between the three pretreatments, ranging from 120ºC to 195ºC. The substantial gap of 75°C between the two temperatures notably influenced the amount of quantified inhibitory compounds in the two hydrolysates, whereas the differences in sugar concentrations were less pronounced. As suggested by the final concentration of acetic acid, 5-HMF, and furfural in H195 (Table 1), this dissimilarity might be linked to the partial degradation of the sugars liberated during pretreatment. Glucose concentrations were approximately 2- and 4-fold higher in H155 and H195 compared to H120, while xylose levels showed increases of 6- and 12-fold, respectively. Arabinose concentrations showed minimal differences between H155 and H195, 5.88 g/L and 6.252 g/L, respectively (Table 1).  As temperatures increased, the concentrations of monosaccharides grew, while cellobiose decreased, as a portion of the glucose released in H155 and H195 derived from cellobiose. Most likely part of the hydrogen bons and the van der Waals linkages connecting the cellulose microfibers (Nishiyama et al., 2002) are broken at 120°C and the structure opened up to facilitate further degradation in glucose monomers. At each temperature step, the overall concentration inhibitors were also increased. In particular, 5-HMF concentrations surged 15-fold and 13-fold with each temperature increase, while furfural increased 1.97 times between 120°C and 155°C and 15 times between 120°C and 195°C. Phenolic compounds, such as p-coumaric acid, syringic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid had a strong increase in the middle (155°C) and high (195°C) pre-treatment temperatures.  54 The liberation of inhibitory compounds and sugars from BSG is strongly related to the composition of the dry biomass and the type of pretreatment involved in the process (Mitri et al., 2022). Carvalheiro et al. (2004) optimized the diluted acid hydrolysis to produce pentose-rich cultivation medium from BSG. The biomass was treated with 3% sulfuric acid solution with a 1:8 liquid-to-solid ratio (w/w). The mixture was kept for 10 min at room temperature and the hydrolysis was performed at 130°C for a period ranging from 2 to 240 min. At the harsher condition, 5-HMF and furfural were found to be 0.25g and 2.3g/100g of dry biomass, while total phenolics were 1.43g every 100 grams of BSG. Other studies presented different combinations of inhibitors and diverse ratio of toxic compounds and released sugars even when same conditions were applied.  In this study, despite the notable accumulation of sugars across the three cases, this was found to be relatively moderate compared to the concurrent increase of inhibitory compounds. This observation highlights a critical aspect concerning the trade-off between improved sugar concentrations and the intensified presence of inhibitors in biomass-based hydrolysates resulting from harsher pretreatment conditions. The perspective of utilizing these hydrolysates for microbial fermentation thus requires careful consideration when applying severe pretreatment methods.   Table 1.

All strains were inoculated at the same initial OD (600nm) of 0.05 from pre-cultures in a minimal medium containing glucose at 4%. Growth performance was monitored for up to 96 h (Figure 1). B. xenovorans was solely grown in H120 due to prolonged pre-inoculum growth time (over 72 h) compared to other strains, which showed sufficient growth within 24 h.  Notably, in hydrolysate H195, bacterial growths were sluggish, lacking a well-defined exponential phase, with no strains exhibiting a growth rate (μ) higher than 0.060 h-1 (Table 2). This condition, despite the abundance of available monomeric sugars (23.3 g/L in total, Table 1), also carries a high number of inhibitory compounds that affect the strain’s growth. The maximum OD (not more than 2.5) was uniformly reached within 72 h across strains, maintaining similar values throughout the monitoring period.

Growth expressed as Optical Density (OD; at 600nm) per hour of Pseudomonas alloputida DSM 6125 (blue triangle, △), Rhodococcus sp. DSM 43001 (white square, ◻), Bacillus coagulans DSM 2314 (grey rhombus, ◇), Corynebacterium glutamicum DSM 20300 (orange star, ✱), Acinetobacter radioresistens DSM 6976 (green circle, ○) and Burkholderia xenovorans DSM 17367 (red cross, ✕)  in three BSG hydrolysates (H195, H155 and H120) produced treating the biomass with 1,25% H2SO4 at 195, 155 and 120 °C, respectively. The Standard errors are represented by error bars.  Instead, significant differences were noted between strains when comparing performances in H120 and H155. For example, Corynebacterium glutamicum did not grow in H120 but exhibited growth in H155, reaching peak OD value at 48 h. The variability in performance could be linked to higher sugar content, facilitating initial growth and overall cell density, even in the presence of inhibitors in H150. Pseudomonas alloputida and Rhodococcus 
 56 sp. displayed superior performances compared to the other bacteria in both conditions, H120 and H155. In H120, P. alloputida entered the stationary phase after a brief exponential phase of 5 h, achieving a maximum OD of 4.25, while in H155 it exhibited rapid growth and high cell density reaching a maximum OD value of 12. Rhodococcus showed a slightly longer Lag phase (around 5 h) but grew to higher OD values. P. alloputida exhibited the highest maximum growth rate of 0.798 h-1, (Table 2.), and again together with Rhodococcus, in H155, being 0.126 and 0.145 h-1, respectively (Table 2.).  In the presence of more sugars and inhibitors, both strains demonstrated enhanced growth and likely higher tolerance to phenolics and other inhibitors, such as weak acid and furan aldehydes. In some studies, the performances of the native strains in lignocellulose-derived hydrolysates have been improved using Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) (Kurosawa et al., 2015) or genetic engineering to induce higher tolerance to inhibitors or introduce new abilities in the use of the phenolic compound from lignin as sole carbon source (Liu et al., 2020).   Table 2. Growth rates (h-1) of bacterial strains in the three BSG hydrolysates. The growth rates were estimated by performing linear regression on OD values obtained during the exponential growth phase, allowing an approximation of the growth rate constant in exponential growth models.           However, in this work rather than focusing on enhancing the strains strongly impacted by high inhibitor content, it was preferable to choose from a pool of 6 established bacteria, those already demonstrating significant potential to thrive in phenolics-rich hydrolysates without requiring any adaptation. The complexity of the hydrolysates and the fast adaptation to complex medium containing both sugars and inhibitors made, P. alloputida and Rhodococcus the perfect candidates for further experiments to test their ability to use phenolic compounds and other inhibitors as sole carbon sources. For this reason, in this work, it has   Growth rate μ (h-1)   H120 H155 H195 DSM 6125 (P. alloputida)  0.798 0.126 0.056 DSM 6976 (A. radioresistens) 0.072 0.040 0.040 DSM 43001 (Rhodococcus sp.)  0.127 0.145 0.060 DSM 20300 (C. glutamicum)  0.040 0.070 0.041 DSM 2314 (B. coagulans)  0.026 0.117 0.050 DSM 17367 (B. xenovorans) 0.037 - -  57 been performed analysis of the growth and the metabolic abilities of P. alloputida and Rhodococcus using a minimal medium containing phenolics and furan aldehydes as sole carbon sources. 2.3.3 Growth of P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. in minimal medium supplemented with furan aldehydes as the sole carbon source The use of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural as the sole carbon source in three different concentrations revealed a concentration-dependent response in both bacterial strains, characterized by a prolonged lag phase and reduced growth rates as the concentrations increased (Figure 2A. and 2C.).  Notably, at the highest concentration of 5-HMF (10 mM), moderate growth rates were sustained, indicating an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. In these conditions, the maximum optical density reached by Pseudomonas was consistently about double that of Rhodococcus, underscoring differential susceptibility to 5-HMF between the two strains. In a previous study conducted by Guarnieri et al. (2017), employing a similar strain of Pseudomonas and similar concentrations of 5-HMF in shaking flasks, it was noted that starting growth at OD 0.2 resulted in an approximate maximum OD of 0.3 after 48 h of incubation, where in this work the maximum OD was 0.75 starting at 0.05. Li et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2014) studied lipid production using Rhodococcus strains and verified the transformation of furfural and 5-HMF in defined media, but the compounds were not the sole carbon source.

A. P. alloputida; B P. alloputida; C Rhodococcus sp. The Standard errors are represented by error bars.  
 58  In the study of Li et al. (2022), 5-HMF persisted in the fermentation media, suggesting a slower degradation rate. Various oxidized intermediates, including 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid, 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid, 2,5-diformylfuran, and furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid, were identified from the degradation of 5-HMF. The generation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid and 2,5-diformylfuran represented distinct first-step oxidation processes of 5-HMF by R. jostii RHA1. Similarly, a wild-type C. glutamicum strains can convert furan aldehydes into less toxic alcohols and acids forms, accumulating in fermentation broths as the bacteria could not fully metabolize them (Tsuge et al.; 2014; Zhou et al.; 2019; Park et al., 2015).  Although the inhibition by furan aldehydes is affecting the growth profiles, the HPLC analysis demonstrated that both bacterial strains were proficient in completely degrading 5-HMF at every concentration tested, yielding an unexpected major by-product, gallic acid (Figure 3C.). It is noteworthy that the compound identified as gallic acid in the analysis might potentially be another compound sharing similar characteristics, considering the pathways of degradation of furan aldehydes proposed by Guarnieri for an engineered Pseudomonas putida. Furthermore, investigations involving Pseudomonas in an M9 medium supplemented with furfural as the sole carbon source highlighted its capacity to utilize furfural and convert it into 2-furoic acid (Figure 3B.), particularly notable when furfural concentrations exceeded 5 mM (corresponding to 0.5 g/L). This process, however, induced an elongation of the lag phase from 2 h at 1 mM to 12 h at 10 mM (Figure 4), despite similar growth rates between the curves (data not shown). This surprising result challenges previous studies indicating the requirement for an integrated pathway for complete degradation of both 5-HMF and furfural. Specifically, previous work expressing the Ptac-driven hmf gene cluster from Burkholderia phytofirmans in P. putida KT2440 demonstrated the necessity for an integrated pathway (Guarnieri et al., 2017). However, in our study, the observed conversion of furfural to 2-furoic acid by Pseudomonas contradicts this need (Figure 3B.).  Although the Pseudomonas strain theoretically possesses the enzymatic capacity for this reaction, these findings diverge from expectations. Notably, in the referenced metabolically engineered strain, this molecular capability was enhanced to ensure the production of the intermediate 2-furoic acid for further metabolic processing into biomass. The bacterial metabolism of furfural and 5-HMF has been elucidated in Cupriavidus basilensis HMF14 (Koopman et al, 2010) and in P. putida ALS1267 (Crigler et al., 2020). Unlike C. basilensis, which possesses distinct furfural and HMF operons, P. putida ALS1267 features a single contiguous operon housing all metabolic genes, except hmfH gene. The hmfH gene encodes  59 HMF/furfural oxidoreductase, exhibiting both HMF acid oxidase and furfural/HMF dehydrogenase activities. Interestingly, P. putida ALS1267 lacks a homologous hmfH gene, suggesting the presence of an alternative gene in its genome fulfilling this function. P. putida strain (mt-2 KT2440) used in this study harbors gene responsible for catabolism of toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylane on a transmissible plasmid, known as TOL (Worsey & Williams, 1975). The presence of this genetic feature may contribute to the exceptional metabolic characteristics exhibited by the strain in the present study.  These results collectively underscore the complexity of microbial responses to furan derivatives and the possibility of alternative metabolic pathways or adaptations in P. putida that justify further investigation for optimized biomass utilization and bioconversion strategies.

The figure presents the HPLC quantifications of 5-HMF, furfural, and their respective metabolite at the beginning (left side of each graph) and conclusion (right side of each graph) of the growth of P. alloputida (A. and B.) and Rhodococcus (C.). 2.3.4 Growth of P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. in minimal medium supplemented with phenolic compounds as sole carbon source Notonier et al. (2021) reported that both Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus strains were unable to grow in the presence of 5 mM syringic acid as the sole carbon source. However, in this work, both strains exhibited growth when exposed to 0.5 mM syringic acid, achieving OD values around 1. Notably, as the syringic acid concentration increased, Rhodococcus displayed extended lag phases and decreased growth rates (Figure 4.), suggesting a dose-dependent impact on microbial growth. The divergence between observed growth and HPLC analysis revealing a considerable reduction in total syringic acid before and after bacterial incubation is noteworthy (Figure 5). This discrepancy might be attributed to the formation of metabolic 
 60 intermediates or products, such as caffeic acid and furfural, arising from syringic acid degradation.  
 Figure 4. Growth profiles of Pseudomonas alloputida DSM 6125 and Rhodococcus sp. DSM 43001 in M9 supplemented with phenolic compound. The growth profiles are expressed as Optical Density (OD; at 600nm) per hour. M9 with p-coumaric acid (A), vanillin (B), ferulic acid (C), or syringic acid (D, E, for Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus, respectively) as the sole carbon source. The tested concentrations were 0.5 mM (grey square, ◻), 2.5 mM (white circle, ○), 5 mM (red rhombus, ◇), 10 mM (yellow triangle, △), 12 mM (green square, ◻), 15 mM (black cross, ✕). The Standard errors are represented by error bars.   These metabolic products could be the reason for the observed inhibition. However, this unexpected growth contradicts the expected outcomes based on the established metabolic pathways reported for the specific Pseudomonas putida strain by Notonier et al. (2021). Such findings warrant further experiments and detailed studies on the metabolic pathways involved in syringic acid conversion.  Exploration of these pathways could shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed growth responses and the potential formation of compounds aiding in reconciling the unexpected growth outcomes with the anticipated metabolic pathways, contributing to a deeper understanding of their metabolic versatility and adaptation to aromatic compounds.  
 61 The catabolism of syringic acid, as described by the same authors, revealed that its metabolism could be augmented by supplementing the media with additional carbon sources like glucose or vanillic acid. Notably, two reactions were identified in syringic acid degradation, catalyzed by the vanAB enzyme, which also facilitates the breakdown of vanillic acid. This enzyme's non-specific activity toward substrates suggests broader metabolic adaptability of these bacterial strains in degrading lignin-derived aromatics.  
 Figure 5. Conversion profiles of syringic acid by P. alloputida (A) and Rhodococcus sp. (B). The figure presents the HPLC quantifications of syringic acid and its metabolites at the beginning (left side of each graph) and conclusion (right side of each graph) of the growth of P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp.  Moving to another common lignin-derived aromatic, p-coumaric acid, Pseudomonas' growth in the M9 medium was assessed across seven concentrations ranging from 0.5 mM to 15 mM. Interestingly, the strain demonstrated growth in all tested conditions, with decreasing growth rates correlating with higher inhibitor concentrations. Notably, a substantial lag phase extension was observed only at the highest concentration (15 mM), potentially influenced by the presence of ethanol. The impact of ethanol on bacterial growth was scrutinized due to its potential to compromise microbial performance by affecting cell membrane integrity and enzyme activities (Piotrowski et al., 2014). In these experiments, it was monitored the growth in M9 with glucose supplemented with 2% and 4% ethanol (v/v), and both Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus exhibited unhindered growth up to 2% ethanol but experienced complete inhibition at 4% ethanol (data not shown), which was present only with 15 mM of p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid. The maximum OD ranged from 1.2 at 2.5 mM to 0.3 at 15 mM, indicating concentration-dependent effects on growth dynamics. Comparison with Ravi et al. (2017) revealed differences in growth responses. Specifically, the study at 5 mM p-Coumaric acid 
 62 demonstrated a longer lag phase and a higher maximum OD compared to our findings. The differences in growth dynamics might be related to experimental conditions, such as medium composition and incubation duration. The absence of a decline in cell density post-substrate depletion in our curves suggests a potential availability of additional nutrients or metabolic routes beyond the tested conditions, influencing bacterial behavior post-substrate utilization. Exploration of these variations provides insights into the diverse responses of bacteria to p-coumaric acid at different concentrations and highlights the need for standardized methodologies and comprehensive analyses to comprehend the full spectrum of metabolic adaptability and responses of bacterial strains to lignin-derived aromatics.  The metabolism of p-coumaric acid under different conditions revealed its conversion predominantly into 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, occurring completely between concentrations of 0.5 mM and 7 mM, and partially at higher concentrations (Figure 6.). Studies on P. putida have elucidated a four-step process where p-coumaric acid is metabolized into 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and further transformed into protocatechuic acid, integrating into the TCA cycle (Ravi et al., 2017). In our findings (Figure 6), accumulation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid was evident, potentially attributed to inadequate oxygenation during the incubation in the microplate. This observation aligns with the oxygen-dependent nature of further metabolizing 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, explaining its accumulation in the fermentation broth. Notably, unlike previous studies by Ravi et al. (2017) where complete conversion of p-coumaric acid to biomass was reported, our results suggest a constant presence of intermediates along the pathways, implying potential limitations in the efficient utilization of p-coumaric acid as a carbon source, yet it also emphasizes the complexity in efficiently converting it to biomass. Understanding the intricate metabolic pathways involved and the influence of environmental factors like oxygenation remains critical in deciphering the strain's metabolic robustness and its efficient utilization of lignin-derived aromatics.  In parallel experiments conducted with Rhodococcus, noticeable variability emerged among replicates (data not shown), potentially attributed to characteristics observed during pre-culturing. Preparations with Rhodococcus frequently exhibited cell aggregates and viscosity akin to biofilm formation in liquid phases. Bacterial cells forming biofilms often indicate a stress response to environmental factors like limited nutrients or low oxygen availability (Héctor M. Alvaréz, 2010). Efforts were made to enhance oxygen availability and prevent aggregate formation by augmenting agitation frequency and headspace volume. However, these attempts did not mitigate the issue, and no discernible correlation was evident between aeration and aggregate formation in Rhodococcus cultivation.   63 Different media used for cultivation displayed distinct impacts on biofilm and cell aggregate formation compared to M9 with glucose as the sole carbon source. Richer media like LB and YPD accentuated biofilm and cell aggregate formation, likely due to increased nutrient availability, facilitating more efficient production of biofilm matrix and flocculants by the bacteria. An intriguing observation from Engelhart-Straub et al. (2022) highlighted that Rhodococcus tends to organize into cell aggregates upon exposure to natural or specific wavelengths of light. This raises the possibility that environmental stimuli, such as light exposure, could influence the aggregation behavior of Rhodococcus, shedding light on potential external factors impacting its growth dynamics and aggregate formation. Addressing the challenges associated with Rhodococcus variability is anticipated to minimize discrepancies among replicates and verify the strain's tolerance to elevated p-coumaric acid concentrations. Previous reports by Bhatia et al. (2019) established an IC50 value of 13.4 mM for Rhodococcus sp. YHY01 against this inhibitor, emphasizing the need to ascertain its tolerance under varied conditions for a comprehensive understanding.  In exploring Pseudomonas' utilization of ferulic acid and vanillin as sole carbon sources, consistent results were obtained with ferulic acid, except at 15 mM, where no growth was observed (Figure 4). Incremental increases in ferulic acid concentration led to reduced maximum optical density (OD) values (from 1.03 to 0.30), decreased growth rates, and extended lag phases, noticeable up to 7 mM concentrations. However, if compared with other studies, the findings of this work are promising. Contrasting findings were reported by Plaggenborg et al. (2003) and Ravi et al. (2017) in shake flask experiments using the same Pseudomonas putida strain exposed to 4.5 mM and 5 mM ferulic acid, respectively. They observed longer lag phases and lower final OD values (~0.5 to 0.8) compared to this study. Notably, a decrease in cell density post 8 h reported by Ravi et al. was absent in the growth curves (Figure 3D), potentially indicating sustained nutrient availability for further metabolism in this study.  The HPLC analysis revealed vanillic acid as the main by-product, exhibiting an increase as ferulic acid concentration declined (Figure 6). These observations underscore the sensitivity of Pseudomonas to varying ferulic acid concentrations and its conversion into vanillic acid. Discrepancies in growth patterns compared to prior studies indicate potential differences in nutrient availability or metabolic activity. Further investigations into the dynamics of ferulic acid metabolism in Pseudomonas and the impact of varied cultivation conditions are essential for elucidating optimal utilization pathways and improving process predictability and efficiency. Ferulic acid, during its conversion to vanillic acid in P. putida, undergoes three  64 reactions catalyzed by feruloyl-CoA synthase, enoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase, and vanillin dehydrogenase (Ravi et al., 2017). Subsequent degradation of vanillic acid necessitates oxygen presence in the media. However, efficient aeration, critical for complete ferulic acid conversion, might be more attainable in shake flasks than in microplate systems, affecting the metabolic fate of vanillic acid. Vanillic acid, being a less toxic form of vanillin, is rapidly accumulated by bacteria to counter strong inhibition by vanillin. As anticipated, experiments with vanillin demonstrated high accumulation of vanillic acid (Figure 6). Pseudomonas exhibited growth across all tested vanillin concentrations (0.5 to 15 mM, Figure 4). Notably, a lag phase increase of approximately 25 h was observed between 7 mM and 15 mM vanillin, corroborating its toxicity, as evidenced by the decline in final OD (from 1.03 at 2.5 mM to 0.30 at 15 mM) (Figure 7). Comparable findings were reported by Simon et al. (2014) in shake flasks with 6.6 mM vanillin, indicating a similar lag phase duration and higher maximum OD value. Contrasting observations between this study and Ravi et al. (2017) at 5 mM vanillin highlight longer lag phases in their work.  Despite limited oxygenation in microplate experiments, Pseudomonas displayed positive responses to these aromatic compounds. This suggests the strain's resilience and ability to adapt to varying oxygen conditions, influencing the observed metabolic outcomes. The discrepancy in growth dynamics compared to studies utilizing different experimental setups emphasizes the importance of understanding how environmental factors, like oxygen availability, impact microbial responses to aromatic compounds. Further investigations into Pseudomonas' adaptive mechanisms under varied oxygen levels are crucial for elucidating optimal metabolic pathways and enhancing bioprocess predictability.           65  Figure 6. Conversion profiles of vanillin, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid by P. alloputida. The figure presents the HPLC quantifications of vanillin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and their respective metabolite at the beginning (left side of each graph) and conclusion (right side of each graph) of the growth of P. alloputida.

Duration of lag phase (h) of the growths of P. alloputida (A) and Rhodococcus (B) in phenolic compounds and furan aldehydes at the different tested concentrations. 2.3.5 Growth of P. alloputida in M9 supplemented with a cocktail of inhibitory compounds in shaking flasks. Once P. alloputida demonstrated to have a great ability in using inhibitory compounds, such as furan aldehydes and phenolic compounds, its strength in metabolizing combination of these inhibitors was further tested. To this aim, the response of P Putida to a cocktail of inhibitors mirroring those found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates was assessed. This mixture included 5-HMF, furfural, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and vanillin at specified concentrations without other carbon sources. Observations revealed a notable impact of initial cell concentration on bacterial growth dynamics in the presence of the inhibitor cocktail. At a low initial OD, P. alloputida exhibited impaired growth, failing to thrive under these conditions (data not shown). However, when 
 67 subjected to the same inhibitor concentrations but with a higher initial OD, the strain demonstrated remarkable resilience, reaching an OD of 8 after a 24-h lag phase. Conversely, when halving the inhibitor concentrations while maintaining a low initial OD, the strain exhibited a shorter lag phase (10 h) and achieved a maximum OD of 2.5, indicating a reduced inhibitory effect. This mix of toxic compounds presented a combined inhibitory effect, compelling the bacteria to confront multiple inhibitory challenges simultaneously (Panigrahy et al., 2022). But, increasing the initial OD value appeared to confer an advantage to the strain, enabling it to overcome the inhibitory effects, emphasizing the significance of initial cell concentration in influencing bacterial growth under inhibitor stress (Zha et al., 2012). The observed response highlights the capacity of P. putida to cope with combined inhibitor challenges prevalent in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. These findings illuminate the importance of understanding how varying inhibitor combinations and initial cell densities impact microbial growth and resilience. Such insights are pivotal in optimizing bioprocesses within lignocellulosic biorefineries, requiring further investigations into strain adaptations and mechanisms to counter combined inhibitory effects. HPLC analysis revealed complete depletion of the aromatics within 24 h (Figure 8). Concurrently, there was the accumulation of 2-furoic acid resulting from the conversion of furfural and 5-HMF (Figure 8). These by-products of bacterial metabolism may also present toxicity towards cells including the ones that are generating them. In this case the detoxification process is not complete and ideal since the media still presents toxicity even if this feature is decreased compared to the initial state. However, both vanillin and 2-furoic acid reveal some potential as added-value products.  Notably, a fraction of furfural converted into furfuryl alcohol, entirely consumed after 50 h. When inhibitor concentrations were doubled and the initial OD set at 0.25, a similar trend was observed (Figure 8A.), apart from ferulic and p-coumaric acids, entirely consumed only after 50 h. The accumulation of vanillic acid from vanillin degradation was also noted, while ferulic acid levels were degraded over the same period, indicating the rapid transformation of the inhibitor's chemical nature by the cells. Previous studies demonstrated the absence of 2-furoic acid formation in wild-type P. putida during furfural and 5-HMF degradation, observed only in an engineered strain (Guarnieri et al., 2017). Hence, it could be intriguing to investigate whether the strain utilized in our experiments has undergone natural mutations leading to similar behaviors as the engineered strain reported by Linger et al. (2014). Understanding such adaptations in P. putida's metabolism could offer crucial insights into its unique responses to inhibitor compounds present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. The outcomes depicted in Figures  68 8A and 8C imply that the increased oxygen availability in shaking flasks, compared to microplate aeration system, significantly impacted the bioconversion of inhibitors by Pseudomonas, in conjunction with the initial inoculum size.

 69 2.4 Conclusions and future perspectives  A screening of different bacteria revealed P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. as those exhibiting the highest tolerance to phenolic compounds. From those, the results achieved with P. alloputida underscored its potential to be used as a microbial bioremediator for toxic environments. This finding not only corroborates prior findings but significantly extends our understanding of this strain's detoxification capabilities. Notably, it exhibited high tolerance at markedly higher inhibitor concentrations than previously reported in the literature. Experiments with a cocktail of inhibitors validated the underlying principle of bacterial-mediated detoxification, which could also be applied to detoxify hydrolysates, despite synergistic effect of inhibitors can occur in such media and jeopardize bacterial activities. In this sense, it would be relevant conducting experiments with different combinations of inhibitory compounds as well as with higher concentrations of specific inhibitory compounds, to obtain additional information on the detoxification potential of this microorganism when used in different types of media. Replicating the small scale experiments on a larger scale, such as in shake flasks, would also allow exploring variations arising from the cultivation conditions, particularly oxygen availability.  For Rhodococcus, the formation of cell aggregations during the cultivation suggests potential environmental stressors, such as light exposure, for example. So, refining the cultivation methodology as well as establishing a standardized inoculum preparation protocol would be helpful to better understand its detoxification abilities.  Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate P. putida's remarkable ability to efficiently utilize phenolic compounds from complex mixtures such as lignocellulosic hydrolysates. This opens new opportunities for the development of more sustainable and potentially more economic bioprocesses from lignocellulosic biomass since the detoxification step to remove inhibitors would be avoided resulting in less processing steps, less chemicals and faster global processes.

Mussatto)  ABSTRACT This study aimed to improve the production of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) and acetoin from brewer’s spent grain hemicellulosic hydrolysate (BSG-H) through the co-cultivation of Paenibacillus polymyxa with Pseudomonas alloputida or Rhodococcus sp. More specifically, the research investigated the removal of potential inhibitory compounds, including lignin-derived phenolic compounds, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and furfural, from the fermentation broth by microbial detoxification during the co-cultivation and its influence on the production of 2,3-BDO. Different fermentation temperatures and initial cell concentrations were tested. The production in monocultures and co-cultures was also compared. Overall, 2,3-BDO production was enhanced in co-cultures when compared to monocultures in BSG-H at 34 °C and 37 °C. Both strains, P. polymyxa and Rhodococcus sp., effectively removed inhibitory compounds during the fermentation process. Co-cultures with Rhodococcus sp. demonstrated higher sugar consumption rates, efficiently utilizing glucose, xylose, and arabinose as carbon sources, and producing 2,3-BDO and acetoin at 34 °C and 37 °C. These findings underscore the potential of co-cultures, particularly those involving Rhodococcus sp., for optimizing product yields and mitigating the impact of inhibitory compounds in complex substrate fermentations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin from BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysates using co-cultures.  
 78  Keywords: Brewer’s spent grains; 2,3-butanediol; acetoin; co-culture; Paenibacillus polymyxa; Pseudomonas alloputida; Rhodococcus sp  3.1. Introduction Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) is the most abundant lignocellulosic residue generated by the brewing industry, constituting up to 85% of the total residues from brewing industries (Mussatto and Roberto, 2006). It holds strategic importance due to key attributes, such as high availability, cost-effectiveness, and high content of carbohydrates and proteins (Lynch et al., 2016). For every 100 liters of beer produced, approximately 20 kg of wet BSG is generated (Lynch et al., 2016). In 2022, beer production reached 35.9 billion liters in the sole European countries, and more than 6.4 million tons are annually wasted (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/). Despite its potential as animal feed, BSG poses challenges due to its high moisture content, which is around 80%. Consequently, it tends to spoil quickly and is often disposed of in landfills (Lynch et al., 2016). However, this abundant and underutilized resource presents a significant opportunity for the biological production of biofuels and bioproducts, including valuable compounds such as 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) and acetoin. Microbial 2,3-BDO is a versatile bulk chemical known for its exceptional properties. It is colorless, odorless, transparent, hygroscopic, biodegradable, and highly soluble in water, alcohols, ketones, and ethers (Xie et al., 2022). 2,3-BDO holds a prominent position as a key platform chemical with diverse applications across industries (Bruni and Terrell, 2022; Okonkwo et al., 2021). 2,3-BDO is widely used in the production of solvents, cosmetics, and synthetic rubber. It serves as an antifreeze agent due to its low freezing point. Additionally, it acts as a food additive and plays a dual role in the fuel industry as both a liquid fuel and an "octane booster," enhancing gasoline performance (Maina et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). Acetoin is a versatile compound found naturally in fruits, vegetable flours, wine, and various food products. Its applications span across industries, serving as a flavor enhancer in the food sector and a fragrance agent in cosmetics. In microbiology, botany, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture, acetoin plays a crucial role. It is also a key component in synthesizing α-hydroxyketone derivatives, including optically active ones, and is used in the production of liquid crystal composites and pharmaceuticals (Bruni and Terrell, 2022; Maina et al., 2022). Currently, the industrial production of 2,3-BDO primarily relies on petroleum-derived hydrocarbons, such as butane and 2-butene (Xie et al., 2022). In contrast, acetoin is synthesized  
 79 through various chemical processes, including diacetyl partial reduction, 2,3-BDO selective oxidation, butan-2-one oxidation, alkaline hydrolysis, and acetaldehyde hydrogenation (Kochius et al., 2014). However, recent trends indicate a growing interest in the biological production of both 2,3-BDO and acetoin. Several factors are driving this shift, including the increasing cost of petroleum, environmental concerns, and safety considerations in food and cosmetic applications (Bruni and Terrell, 2022; Maina et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). In this sense, microbial production represents a promising alternative. Producing microorganisms belong to the genera Paenibacillus, Bacillus, Ralstonia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter, among others (Li et al., 2023; Kandasamy et al., 2016; Han et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2021). Among these bacteria, Paenibacillus polymyxa stands out due to its non-pathogenic classification (class 1). The bacterium has shown high production yields for both 2,3-BDO and acetoin and can metabolize C5 and C6 sugars. These features make it suitable for industrial production of 2,3-2,3-BDO and acetoin from lignocellulose-derived sugars. (Jiang et al., 2015; Kanno et al., 2017).  The exploitation of lignocellulosic residues for microbial fermentation requires the use of pretreatment. To this purpose, diluted acid pretreatment is widely used for its effectiveness in solubilizing hemicellulosic sugars (Kumar et al., 2020). However, the release of inhibitory compounds during pretreatment, along with the monomeric sugars, poses a significant challenge in the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. These inhibitors, including formic and acetic acids, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), and phenolic compounds, can be highly toxic to fermentation microorganisms (Kumar et al., 2020 bis).  To address this challenge, in this work is proposed the utilization of co-cultures with microorganisms capable of metabolizing potential inhibitory compounds and sugars. This approach could eliminate the need of indispensable detoxification steps via traditional methods, such as activated charcoal, overliming, or ion-exchange resins, reducing process costs while increasing the yields and productivities of the primary fermentation product (Millán Acosta et al., 2021; V. Kumar et al., 2020). Based on the results obtained a previous work, Pseudomonas alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. hold great potential for the detoxification of hemicellulosic hydrolysates, making them excellent candidates for co-cultures with sugar-consuming microorganisms. They possess the aerobic capacity to degrade furans and phenolic compounds (Parawira and Tekere, 2011; Paisio et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2021).  In this context, the primary objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of co-cultures, specifically involving P. polymyxa and either P. alloputida or Rhodococcus sp., in removing potential inhibitors from the hemicellulosic hydrolysate of brewer's spent grain  
 80 Moreover, the ultimate objective is to achieve enhanced BDO and acetoin production by using different temperatures and initial cell concentration.   3.2. Materials and methods 3.2.1 Raw material Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) was kindly provided by Carlsberg Breweries (Copenhagen, Denmark). The biomass, consisting of an 80% barley malt and 20% barley mixture, was stored at -20°C until use. Prior to dilute acid pretreatment, the BSG was oven-dried at 60ºC to a moisture content below 10%. The biomass was then milled and sieved (1 mm particle size). 3.2.2. Hemicellulosic hydrolysate To obtain a hemicellulosic hydrolysate from BSG, a dilute acid pretreatment of the raw material was performed with 1.25% (w/v) sulfuric acid, 1:8 (w/v) solid:liquid ratio, for 17 min at 155ºC, using a 600 mL Parr reactor (Parr Instr. Co., IL, USA) (Mussatto & Roberto, 2005). Once the pretreatment was performed, liquid-solid fractions were screen separated and the slurry was subjected to 10 min centrifugation (9,000 g, 4ºC, Sorvall Lynx 6000 Centrifuge) to remove the residual solid. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 6.5 and the precipitate was removed after centrifugation (10 min, 9,000 rpm at 4ºC) and vacuum filtration.  The liquid fraction obtained (BSG-H) was analyzed by HPLC for its content in sugars (glucose, xylose, and arabinose) and some of the main lignocellulose-derived inhibitory compounds (acetic acid, formic acid, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), and phenolic compounds), as well as used as fermentation medium after sterilization using membrane filtration. On the other hand, to increase its carbohydrate content, BSG-H was three times concentrated (BSG-CH) using a rotary evaporator (IKA, Staufen, Germany). The BSG-CH was filter-sterilized with 0.2 μm vacuum PES filter units (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA), and its sugar and inhibitor contents were determined through HPLC before fermentation.  
 81 3.2.3. Microorganism, inoculum, and fermentation media  Three bacterial strains were employed in this work: Paenibacillus polymyxa DSM 365 (P), Pseudomonas alloputida DSM 6125 (Pput), and Rhodococcus sp. DSM 43001 (R). The microorganisms were obtained from the German collection of microorganisms (DSMZ, Leibniz, Germany). Strains were stored as glycerol stocks (20% sterile glycerol) at 80ºC before use. The microorganisms were cultivated separately using an M9 minimal pre-culture medium consisting of: salt solution (12,8 g/L Na2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L NaCl, and 1 g/L NH4Cl), trace elements (0.05 g/L EDTA, 0.083 g/L FeCl3.6H2O, 0.084 mg/L ZnCl2, 0.013 mg/L CuCl2.2H2O, 0.01 mg/L CoCl2.6H2O, 0.01 mg/L HBO3, and 0.016 mg/L MnCl2.4H2O), 0.1 mM MgSO4, 0.01 mM CaCl2.2H2O, and 4% glucose. The M9 medium was sterilized by filtration using 0.2 μm vacuum PES filter units (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).  P. polymyxa was cultivated at 37ºC, while P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. were grown at 30ºC, both at 250 rpm for 48 h in 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 mL of M9 medium. Three semi-defined media (SM) were used in fermentations: a semi-defined medium  prepared with 55 g/L of glucose (G-SM), which is the most preferred sugar for P. polymyxa (Okonkwo et al., 2021). The semi-defined medium consisting of C5 and C6 sugars (xylose, arabinose and glucose) was named mixed-sugars semi-defined medium (XAG-SM), and the two-fold concentrated medium was called concentrated mixed-sugars semi-defined medium (XAG-C-SM). The sugar composition of XAG-SM was determined based on the characterization of BSG-H.  BSG-H and its concentrated version (BSG-CH) were also utilized as fermentation media. All fermentation media (SMs, BSG-H and BSG-CH) were sterilized by filtration (using 0.2 μm vacuum PES filter units). All semi-defined media consisted of 10 g/L yeast extract, 0.2 g/L MgSO4, 3 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6), and 3 mL trace elements (Okonkwo et al. 2017).  3.2.4 Fermentation assays Fermentation assays were carried out in a Growth Profiler 960 (Enzyscreen, Heemstede, The Netherlands), using microplates with a working volume of 250 µL and headspace of 100 µL for each well. Three different temperatures (30ºC, 34ºC and 37ºC) were tested, as 37ºC is considered the optimal temperature for P. polymyxa (Häßler et al., 2012; Okonkwo et al.,  
 82 2017), while both P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. were reported to work optimally in the range of  28-30ºC (DSMZ, 2023). A stirring speed of 250 rpm was used in all cases. The data were collected every 20 min for 72 h. Fermentations were carried out both using monocultures of each microorganism and co-cultures, either P. polymyxa/P. alloputida or P. polymyxa/Rhodococcus sp. The inoculum size used was 0.05 OD600 (optical density units) for each microorganism, both in single cultures and co-cultures (P+Pput or P+R). In addition, 0.1 OD600 of P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. were also used in co-cultures with P. polymyxa (P+Pput+ or P+R+) to observe if there an effect related to the initial inoculum.  In this study, we utilized a growth profiler that accommodated ten 96-wells plates. In each experiment, the full capacity of the equipment was utilized by simultaneous runs of the ten plates. Each plate was prepared to have triplicates (within three wells) in all conditions tested, and the ten plates were the same. Additionally, for the purpose of assessing growth, duplicate wells containing media without any microbial inoculation alongside each set of 96 wells (used as negative controls) were included. This setup allowed us to replicate each unique experimental condition a total of 30 times (30 wells in independent plates). This high level of replication facilitated the collection of samples at precise time points throughout the 72-h fermentation process, by withdrawing one plate at specific intervals (0, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 42, 48, and 72 h). The experimental design and sampling approach were precisely structured to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the obtained data collection during the fermentation assays. The collected samples underwent centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 10 min. Subsequently, analysis of the supernatants to quantify total sugars, 2,3-BDO, ethanol, acetoin, 5-HMF, furfural, and total phenolic contents were conducted.  The cell content was obtained by converting the data of the growth profiler in cell dry weight (CDW; g/L). In the growth profiler, the data of bacterial growths are expressed as green value (GV) units. At the end of each experiment the GV units were converted to OD600 values according to the following formula: OD= a(GVvalue - GVblank)b + c(GVvalue - GVblank)d + e(GVvalue - GVblank)f . The constants were as follows: for P. polymyxa a = 0.0199, b = 1, c = 3.87× 10–5, d = 2.06, e = 1.828 × 10–19, f = 9.13, and GVblank = 9.04.; for P. alloputida a = 0.0118, b = 1, c = 2.59 × 10–5, d = 2.38, e = 3.915 × 10–19, f = 8.95, and GVblank = 9.29.; for Rhodococcus sp. a = 0.0218, b = 1, c = 2.68 × 10–5, d = 1.74, e = 2.905 × 10–19, f = 9.19, and GVblank = 8,66.; for P. polymyxa +Rhodococcus sp. a = 0.02085, b = 1, c = 3.27 × 10–5, d = 1.9, e = 2.366 × 10–19, f = 9.16, and GVblank = 8.85.; for P. polymyxa+P. alloputida  a = 0.0158, b = 1, c = 3.23 × 10–5, d = 2.22, e =  
 83 2.8715 × 10–19, f = 9.04, and GVblank =9.165; in the co-cultures, it was assumed that the two bacteria contributed equally to the growth. The equations that correlated GV units to OD were obtained by performing a calibration of each strain in LB medium.  For the CDW determination each strain was cultivated in LB medium (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 10 g/L NaCl) to stationary phase and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in fresh LB to concentrate the suspension and OD600 was measured. Calibration curves were constructed with CDW and OD600. The slope values for each strain were used subsequently to calculate the CDW of the growth profiler cultures. 3.2.5 Analytical methods The content of extractives, structural carbohydrates, lignin and ash in BSG were determined according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analytical methodology (Sluiter et al., 2011, 2008, 2005). The total starch content was analyzed by the “Total Starch Assay Kit” method (Megazyme, Ireland), while the total protein content was measured by the Kjeldahl acid digestion method (described in AOAC (1990) 955.04), applying 6.25 as conversion factor.  The content of sugars (glucose, xylose, and arabinose) and inhibitory compounds (acetic acid, formic acid, furfural, and 5-HMF) in semi-defined media (G-SM, XAG-SM and XAG-C-SM), BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysates (BSG-H and its concentrated form BSG-CH) and fermentation samples, as well as fermentation products (2,3-BDO, ethanol and acetoin) in fermentation samples, were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatograph HPLC + focused system (Dionex Softron GmbH, Germering, Germany). A refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101) and a Bio-Rad Aminex column HPX-87H (300 mm × 7.8 mm) (at 60ºC) were used, being 5 mM H2SO4 the mobile phase employed with a flow of 0.6 mL/min. The total content of phenolic compounds was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method.  Analytical determinations were carried out in triplicate and the average results are shown.    
 84 3.3 Results and discussion 3.3.1 Composition of BSG and BSG hydrolysates In the current study, the chemical composition of the BSG used for acid hydrolysis was as follow (in % w/w dry matter): 17.4 ± 1.8 cellulose, 16.1 ± 0.2 hemicellulose, 16.4 ± 0.1acid-insoluble lignin (AIL), 1.8 ± 0.3 acid-soluble lignin (ASL), 14.9 ± 2.4 extractives, 3.8 ± 0.1 ash, 2.2 ± 0.1 acetyl groups, 7.9 ± 0.9 fat, 1.8 ± 0.1 starch, and 17.4 ± 0.3and protein. After the acid hydrolysis, it was found (Table 1) that xylose was the most abundant sugar extracted from the hemicellulosic fraction, representing 66% of the total sugar content of BSG-H. Phenolic compounds (1.50 g/L) and acetic acid (0.58 g/L) were the most concentrated the inhibitory compounds identified in the hydrolysate. During the acid pretreatment of biomass, acetic acid is usually generated from the hemicellulosic fraction, while phenolic compounds are originated due to the partial breakdown of lignin (Kumar et al., 2020).  To increase the total sugar content in the hemicellulosic hydrolysate (BSG-H) and potentially increase the production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin, BSG-H was concentrated, resulting in a hydrolysate with a total sugar content as high as 63.3 g/L (BSG-CH) compared to the 24.2 g/L contained in BSG-H (Table 1). Together with sugar content, higher levels of inhibitory compounds were also obtained.   Table 1. Composition of BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysates (g/L).

 85 3.3.2 Production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin from glucose To evaluate the ideal combination of media, temperature, and bacteria to produce 2,3-BDO and acetoin, three semi-defined culture media (SM) were used in the fermentation test at 30ºC, 34ºC, and 37ºC, with bacterial monocultures and co-cultures (Figures 1-3).  Production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin was not observed at 30ºC in any of the fermentation medium, including G-SM with glucose (data not shown). As shown for other bacteria, such as Bacillus licheniformis and Raoultella ornithinolytica B6, the synthesis of 2,3-BDO and acetoin by P. polymyxa occurs only at specific experimental condition of pH, temperature, and agitation (Kim T., 2016; Perego et al., 2003).  Among the three temperatures tested in this study, at 34ºC and 37ºC P. polymyxa was accumulating products both in monoculture and co-culture with Rhodococcus sp. (P+R) without a particular difference between the two types of cultivation (Figure 1). The highest 2,3-BDO and acetoin concentrations, 12.6 g/L and 13.3 g/L, respectively, were achieved at 37ºC. This repeated pattern in the production may suggest that the presence of Rhodococcus sp. in co-culture with P. polymyxa did not substantially affect the overall production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin, except when a higher initial concentration of Rhodococcus sp. was used in P+R+, where Rhodococcus sp. might have an advantage on the substrate use. Indeed, the unbalance in the initial inoculum size might have altered the interaction dynamics between the strains and highlights the importance of ensuring favorable/equal conditions for P. polymyxa during the initial growth phase of co-culture. Interestingly, the 2,3-BDO yield was higher in P+R co-culture (0.603 g/L./h) compared to monoculture (0.40 g/L/h) (Table 1s in supplementary materials). In the perspective of industrial application, this increased productivity can be economically beneficial since the maximum concentration of 2,3-BDO is reached in a shorter operation time. However, it is essential to carefully evaluate the co-culture system's stability and sustainability over extended periods to ensure consistent and reliable production.         
 86  Figure 1. Fermentation assays in glucose semi-defined medium (G-SM): assays were conducted in glucose semi-defined medium (G-SM) at two different temperatures, 37°C and 34°C, using single cultures of P. polymyxa (P) and Rhodococcus sp. (R), as well as a co-culture (P+R, P+R+). In co-culture, Rhodococcus sp. was inoculated at initial optical densities (OD) of 0.05 or 0.1, respectively in P+R or P+R+ cultures. Parameters measured included glucose consumption, production of 2,3-Butanediol, and production of Acetoin. 
 
 87 3.3.3 Production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin from C5 and C6 sugars In all cases of fermentation in XAG-SM (Figure 2), most of the sugars were rapidly depleted within 16-20 h, except for single cultures with P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp., where the maximum consumptions were 34% and 11-30%, respectively (Table 1s in supplementary materials). The consumption rates of the sugars in the medium may be related to the type of monosaccharides. For instance, unlike glucose which undergoes glycolysis, C5-sugars, such as xylose and arabinose result to be challenging for most bacteria because additional enzymes and metabolic adaptation are required (Basen M. and Kurrer S. E., 2020).  In this work, P. polymyxa co-metabolize pentose sugars with a similar consumption rate without preference for one over another (data not shown). This was also observed by Okonkwo et al. (2021), who fermented wheat straw hydrolysates using P. polymyxa DSM 365. This ability of P. polymyxa is profitable in the use hemicellulosic hydrolysates from biomass, where C5 sugars are particularly abundant. Moreover, in co-culture, this ability of P. polymyxa may provide a competitive advantage over other bacteria, such as P. alloputida and Rhodococcus, which were not using C5 sugars (data not shown).  In the Figure 2, it can be observed a temperature effect on the production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin. At 37ºC it was generally recorded a higher concentration of both compounds compared to the fermentations at 34ºC. Instead, there is no difference between monoculture and co-cultures in 2,3-BDO and acetoin production, except for the unique case of the co-culture P + Pput+ at 34ºC. In this case, there was significantly lower concentrations of 2,3-BDO (only 0.8 g/L) compared to single cultures (~5 g/L). This suggests that the dominance of certain microorganisms, like P. alloputida, overcomes the metabolic advantage of P. polymyxa on the use of xylose and arabinose and results in a negative impact on the production of 2,3-BDO. Therefore, the initial phases of the co-cultivation are crucial for the final product viability.  Since the use of P. putida and Rhodococcus sp. in co-culture with P. polymyxa did not negatively influence or compromise 2,3-BDO and acetoin production, this fermentation process is robust and consistent. Furthermore, from an industrial perspective, it is remarkable that the maximum 2,3-BDO production was reached quickly within 12-16 h in all cases (except for P+Pput+ at 34ºC) (Table 1s supplementary material).      
 88  Figure 2. Fermentation assays in mixed sugars semi-defined medium (XAG-SM): assays were performed in mixed sugars semi-defined medium (XAG-SM) at two fermentation temperatures (37°C and 34°C). Various cultures and co-cultures were investigated, including P. polymyxa (P), P. alloputida (Pput), and Rhodococcus sp. (R), as well as co-cultures of P. polymyxa + P. alloputida (P+Pput) and P. polymyxa + Rhodococcus sp. (P+R). Co-cultures also involved different initial inoculum sizes of P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp., specifically, 0.05 OD in P+Put and P+R, and 0.1 OD in P+Put+ and P+R+. The parameters measured included total sugars consumption, and the production of 2,3-Butanediol and Acetoin.    
 
 89 In the concentrated C5-C6 semi-defined medium (XAG-C-SM), xylose, glucose and arabinose were 42 g/L, 7.9 g/L, and 18.8 g/L, respectively. With this composition, it was observed glucose completely metabolized, then of 60-97% of arabinose, and lastly only 43 to 67% of xylose was consumed (Table 1s in supplementary materials). This sugar utilization-pattern can be attributed to an excess of xylose in the fermentation broth compared to glucose and arabinose, as well as to a preference of P. polymyxa for glucose and arabinose, regulated by carbon catabolite repression (CCR). According to Ma et al. (2018), P. polymyxa, likewise other bacteria, has a preference for metabolizing glucose first over xylose and arabinose, due to a shorter time required for the synthesis of enzymes involved in glycolysis than in xylose or arabinose metabolism (pentose-phosphate pathway).  Furthermore, when examining the individual cultures of P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp., relatively low sugar consumption was observed, 17 and 27%, respectively. The strain P. putida M2 is capable of co-consuming both hexose and pentose sugars as well as aromatic compounds; however, during cultivation with glucose and aromatic compounds (p-coumarate and ferulic acid) mixture, intermediates (4-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate) accumulated, and substrate consumption was incomplete (Shrestha et al., 2023). Similar to the case of P. putida M2, the sugar consumption rates suggest that there was an excess of sugar mixture in the medium, that activated the carbon catabolite control (CCC), which inhibits the expression of the pathways for nonpreferred compounds but can also generate an important reorganization of the metabolism that requires the activation of several genes (Rojo 2010).  When examining the production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin, distinct behavior was evident in co-cultures of Rhodococcus sp. and P. alloputida with P. polymyxa. The utilization of the P+R co-culture at 37ºC notably boosted the levels of 2,3-BDO and acetoin, reaching 15 g/L and 28.7 g/L, respectively. This represents a significant increase compared to monoculture production, which yielded 6.1 g/L of 2,3-BDO and 12.6 g/L of acetoin (Figure 3). The same was not observed with P. alloputida. The fermentation results show a strong temperature dependency, with higher 2,3-BDO and acetoin concentrations achieved at 37 ºC compared to 34 ºC. This temperature effect is consistent across all the tested conditions. This result is also aligned with the cultivation requirements of P. polymyxa, which has its optimal temperature at 37 ºC.  When P. polymyxa experiences abiotic stresses, such as lack of oxygen, it typically responds to an accumulation of 2,3-BDO (Tinoco D., 2021). In the cases of co-cultivation at 37ºC, the bacterium might have experienced oxygen restriction due to the presence of Rhodococcus sp. and possible water evaporation. In this scenario, co-cultivation can result in  
 90 advantages over monoculture. In an attempt to optimize production while simultaneously reducing costs for potential industrial scale-up, the option of lowering the fermentation temperature to 30°C was considered. This choice was also motivated by the need to align the culture conditions with the optimal temperatures for P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp.; however, suboptimal conditions at 30ºC result in limited or no 2,3-BDO and acetoin production.  
 Figure 3. Fermentation assays in concentrated mixed sugars semi-defined medium (XAG-C-SM):  assays were conducted at different fermentation temperatures (37°C and 34°C). Various cultures and co-cultures were 
 
 91 examined, including P. polymyxa (P), P. alloputida (Pput), and Rhodococcus sp. (R), as well as co-cultures of P. polymyxa + P. alloputida (P+Pput) and P. polymyxa + Rhodococcus sp. (P+R). Co-cultures were also investigated with different initial inoculum size of P. putida and Rhodococcus sp., specifically, 0.05 OD in P+Pput and P+R, and 0.1 OD in P+Pput+ and P+R+. The parameters measured included total sugars consumption, and the production of 2,3-Butanediol and Acetoin.  3.3.4 BDO and acetoin production from BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysates Two BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysates (their compositions are presented in Table 1), BSG-H and BSG-CH, were used for fermentation experiments at 30, 34 and 37 ºC in co-culture and monoculture.  In no production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin was attained at 30 ºC across all bacterial combinations in BSG-H, and in all the condition tested for BSG-CH. Moreover, when BSG-H hydrolysates was used for co-cultures with P. alloputida, independently of P. alloputida initial concentration, 2,3-BDO and acetoin were not produced also at 34 and 37ºC. Instead, BDO and acetoin were synthesis in co-cultures with Rhodococcus sp. (P+R) at higher concentrations than in monoculture (Figure 4). In P+R at 34 ºC, it was measured a notable 48% increase in 2,3-BDO production compared to monoculture. In co-cultures P+R+ any improvement of BDO production was observed, regardless of the temperatures. In BSG-H, the highest 2,3-BDO production (3.7 g/L) was achieved at 34ºC after 36 h of fermentation. Similarly, the highest acetoin production (8.5 g/L) when the co-culture approach was used at 37ºC.  By comparing BDO production in BSG-H with that in the XAG semi-defined medium, which shares the same sugars composition but lacks inhibitor compounds, 2,3-BDO concentrations, yields and productivities in BSG-H were generally lower then XAG-SM (Table 1s and 2s in supplementary materials). This outcome can likely be attributed to the presence of antimicrobial compounds, primarily phenolic compounds, in BSG-H, which may generate some toxicity for P. polymyxa  In a recent study, P. polymyxa DSM 365 grown in a non-detoxified wheat straw hydrolysate was producing similar concentration of acetoin but higher BDO concentration than in this work (Okonkwo et al., 2021). For this hydrolysate, 15 % (w/v) wheat straw was pretreated at 121 ºC for 1 h with 1 % (v/v) sulfuric acid, and subsequently subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis (Okonkwo et al., 2021). The differences in the pre-treatment and the enzymatic hydrolysis determined the composition of the resulting hydrolysates. The more severe process used in this work for BSG-H could have been resulted in a higher toxicity, while the use of enzymes in Okonkwo's process contributed to achieving a higher sugar  
 92 concentration. It is not surprising that the 2,3-BDO yield is lower in this work than with wheat straw hydrolysate. However, it is noteworthy that comparable levels of acetoin are achieved with fewer sugars. This observation further supports previous research indicating that acetoin production is indeed a metabolic response to the stress imposed by nutrient limitations (Cui et al., 2022). P. polymyxa ATCC 12321 achieved BDO yield of  0.18 g/g  from corn stover enzymatic hydrolysate (Ma et al., 2018), which is similar to the yield in this work (0.14 g/g). Jia et al. (2017) reported lower acetoin yields but higher acetoin concentrations (12.6 g/L) from alkali-pretreated corncob through simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process using Bacillus subtilis IPE5-4.  
 Figure 4. Fermentation assays in BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysate (BSG-H): assays were conducted at different fermentation temperatures (37°C and 34°C). The study involved cultures of P. polymyxa (P) and Rhodococcus sp. (R) separately, as well as the co-culture of P. polymyxa + Rhodococcus sp. (P+R). Co-cultures were investigated with different concentrations of Rhodococcus sp., specifically, 0.05 OD in P+R and 0.1 OD in P+R+. Parameters measured included total sugars consumption, and the production of 2,3-butanediol and acetoin.  
 
 93  Figure 5. Profiles of Metabolites in Fermentation Assays in BSG Hemicellulosic Hydrolysate (BSG-H): profiles of various metabolites, including acetic acid, 5-HMF, furfural, and total phenolic content, are presented. Fermentation assays were conducted at different fermentation temperatures, namely 37°C and 34°C. The study involved cultures of P. polymyxa (P) and Rhodococcus sp. (R) separately, as well as the co-culture of P. polymyxa + Rhodococcus sp. (P+R). Co-cultures were explored with different concentrations of Rhodococcus sp., specifically, 0.05 OD in P+R and 0.1 OD in P+R+. 
 
 94 3.3.5 Bacterial remediation of inhibitory compounds in BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysates In a separate experiment using BSG-CH, no microbial growth nor BDO and acetoin production were achieved. The exceptionally high content of total phenols (3.24 g/L) in BSG-CH is likely responsible for its toxicity to P. polymyxa, P. alloputida, and Rhodococcus sp. Phenolic compounds have been recognized as highly toxic in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, even at low concentrations, affecting cell growth and metabolism (Mussatto and Roberto, 2004). Concentrations of phenolic compounds exceeding 3 g/L have been shown to be absolutely toxic to other microorganisms, such as Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida guilliermondii (López-Linares et al., 2018). Furthermore, the combined inhibitory effects of various compounds can exacerbate microbial inhibition. Then, the inhibition of these microorganism, P. polymyxa, P. putida and Rhodococcus sp, can be boosted by the synergistic effect of different inhibitor compounds in the hydrolysate (Klinke et al., 2004).  Instead, the phenolic compounds in BSG-H (1.5 g/L) were consumed by P. polymyxa but particularly reduced (36%) in co-cultures with Rhodococcus sp. (P+R+) (Figure 5). Ljubas et al. (2022) also observed than P. polymyxa DSM 365 is able to extensively metabolize certain phenolic compounds, such as p-coumaric acid, while showing lower but considerable consumption rate for others, like vanillic acid and vanillin.   In the hydrolysate it was also identified a significant amount of acetic acid (0.8 g/L). In the Figure 5 can be observed an accumulation of acetic acid during the first 24 h of the fermentation, and a subsequent consumption up to 80% of its initial concentration, especially in co-cultures (P+R and P+R+). The biosynthesis of 2,3-BDO from pyruvate competes with the formation of various by-products, such as organic acid (Lee et al., 2019). The accumulation of acid lead to acidification of the intracellular environment, and BDO plays a crucial role in the neutralization of the pH derived from organic acids production (Maina et al., 2022). According to Nakashimada et al. (2000), acetate concentrations below 12 g/L can positively induce BDO production and  mitigate the inhibitory effect of other type of other compounds in fermentation medium (Jurchescu, 2014).  Also 5-HMF and furfural were rapidly consumed in all cases, between 12 and 24 h of fermentation, with co-cultures exhibiting faster consumption. Interestingly, P. polymyxa demonstrated the ability to metabolize these molecules when < 2g/L. According to Domínguez de María and Guajardo (2017) and Yan et al. (2018), in fermentation processes the microbial remediation to inhibitor compounds can be operated in two way: 1) by complete degradation or 2) by conversion into a less toxic intermediate.   
 95 Despite P. polymyxa showed important abilities in reducing the initial concentration of many inhibitory compounds from the BSG hydrolysate, a substantial contribution was given by co-cultivation with Rhodococcus. This outcome, together with the results obtained for BDO and acetoin production, proved the effectiveness of co-cultivation strategy in the fermentation of biomass-derived media.   3.4. Conclusion In this study, BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysate was used as a fermentation medium for 2,3-BDO and acetoin production by P. polymyxa in co-culture with P. alloputida or Rhodococcus sp. Both strains, P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp, presented great capacity to remove inhibitory compounds from fermentation medium when used in co-culture with P. polymyxa. In co-cultures with Rhodococcus sp., P. polymyxa exhibited higher sugar consumption rates, efficiently utilizing glucose, xylose, and arabinose at both 34 °C and 37 °C. 2,3-BDO production was enhanced in these co-cultures compared to monocultures in BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysate and in semi-defined media. These findings provide valuable insights into the utilization of hemicellulosic hydrolysates for 2,3-BDO and acetoin production, highlighting the potential benefits of using co-cultures in complex substrate fermentations to overcome medium toxicity. To advance these results, future investigation could be focused on testing the consumption of higher inhibitor concentrations (mainly phenolic compounds) by P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. in co-cultures, which would allow to further improve the production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin by P. polymyxa.

 Figure 1s. Growth profiling based on Cell Dry Weight (g/L) for 38 h: growth profiles of various cultures were analyzed based on cell dry weight measurements (g/L) over a 38-h fermentation period. The conditions examined included single cultures of P. polymyxa (P), P. alloputida (Pput), and Rhodococcus sp. (R), as well as co-cultures of P. polymyxa with either Rhodococcus sp. (P+R) or P. alloputida (P+Pput). These experiments were conducted at different temperatures (30 °C, 34 °C, and 37 °C) and in various growth media, including G-SM, BSG-H, and XAG-SM. Additionally, observations in XAG-C-SM were made at 34 °C.     
 
 105 Cell growth In the semi-defined medium with glucose (G-SM), substantial bacterial growth was observed at 30 °C in all the cases, while the growth profiles were notably reduced at 34 °C and 37°C (Figure 1s). Rhodococcus sp. did not growth at 37°C, while at 30°C, it displayed a shorter lag phase (less than 3 h) compared to 34 °C. Instead, P. polymyxa and P. alloputida were growing in all the tested temperatures. The maximum cell concentration (1 g/L) for P. alloputida was reached at 30 °C.  At 30 °C in the co-cultivations, the total cell density was significantly higher than in single cultures, and the growth profile resembled a diauxic curve. Several hypotheses have been considered to explain these growth patterns. One possibility could be that one or both bacteria released secondary metabolites in response to stress and subsequently utilize these metabolites for growth. Alternatively, they might have released toxins to eliminate the other bacterial cells and have used the lysed cells as carbon and nitrogen sources.  In the case of Rhodococcus sp., which exhibited a pronounced “diauxic profile” in co-culture with P. polymyxa, it has been hypothesized that as a response to stresses, such as the presence of an organism, Rhodococcus could have accumulated carotenoids and due to this the cells could have become larger than normal. Large cells could have been detected in the growth profiler as a higher green pixel value, mispairing high G values of the profiler to copious growth of the bacterium. Liu et al. (2020) reported that the production of lipids and carotenoids in some oleaginous yeasts can change based on the C:N ratio, which is a dynamic parameter during fermentation. Differences of this ratio may be a reason of an increase in the carotenoids content. Lastly, the increase in the g value may be also related to the tendency (3-fold higher) of Rhodococcus sp. to aggregate when carotenoids are accumulated in the cell (Zheng et al., 2013). In the hemicellulosic hydrolysate, Rhodococcus sp. only exhibited growth at its optimal temperature, 30°C. In the BSG-H hydrolysate, Rhodococcus displayed a much longer lag phase, lasting 15 h as opposed to the 3 h seen in the G-SM medium. The contribution of Rhodococcus in co-culture with P. polymyxa (P) was evident, as indicated by a shorter lag phase of growth (8 h instead of 15) and a higher cell density of 0.6 g/L compared to P. polymyxa monoculture. In contrast, P. polymyxa did not exhibit growth at 30°C, and in co-culture with P. alloputida, the length of the lag phase decreased inversely with an increase in temperature. This observation aligns with the fact that P. alloputida thrives at 30°C, which is its optimal temperature. Across all temperatures, co-cultures involving P. alloputida consistently resulted  
 106 in higher cell concentrations. These results strengthen the notion that co-cultivation is advantageous when both bacteria involved have compatible and complementary metabolic behaviors.  In the XAG-SM medium, the growth of Rhodococcus sp. at 34°C and 37°C showed an increase in the lag phase and a decrease in cell concentration as the temperature moved further away from its optimal growth temperature. At 34°C, the growth exhibited a diauxic shape, which can be attributed to the presence of mixed sugars (C5-C6) in the medium. Other Rhodococcus sp. activate carbon catabolite repression and show this biphasic growth in the presence of glucose along with other carbon sources (Araki et al. 2011).  In this medium in co-cultivation with P. polymyxa, Rhodococcus sp. did not significantly contribute to the growth. The growth profile of P. polymyxa in monoculture closely resembled the profiles observed in co-culture. It is noteworthy that P. polymyxa exhibited better growth at 34°C than at 37°C, which was unexpected considering the reported optimal temperature for this strain. Biphasic growth patterns were also observed in both P. alloputida and P. polymyxa monocultures at 30°C. Notably, P. polymyxa exhibited a rapid switch of carbon source within 2 h, while P. alloputida took 7 h to undergo the transition. However, when P. alloputida was combined with P. polymyxa at 34 °C, the initial 10 h of growth closely mirrored the growth of P. alloputida alone in monoculture, and the overall cell concentration was significantly lower than that of P. alloputida alone, despite exhibiting a diauxic growth profile. When the XAG-SM medium was concentrated (XAG-C-SM), the growth profiles of all bacterial combinations retained the same patterns as those observed in the non-concentrated medium under the same cultivation condition but with the dry cell weights higher in all cases, as predictable by the concentration of total sugars in the medium.  These findings highlight the complex interactions and growth patterns of Rhodococcus sp., P. polymyxa, and P. alloputida under various temperature and medium conditions. Co-cultivation can enhance cell densities but may not consistently follow diauxic growth patterns, and the choice of medium plays a crucial role in these interactions. Further investigations are needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and optimize these bacterial cultures. This study can be improved by integrating analysis to quantify each strain’s contributions to uncover how they cooperate or compete, and which is their impact in the overall production performances and fermentation abilities.

 109 Preliminary experiment  Background 2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BDO) is a versatile C4 platform chemical widely used in various industries. Its production via microbial fermentation, particularly by bacteria like Paenibacillus polymyxa, is crucial for advancing the carbon-neutral economy (Rehman, 2022). The synthesis of 2,3-BDO in bacteria is triggered by an acidic environment to counteract intracellular acidification and maintain the NAD+/NADH ratio (Han et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2014). However, a major challenge in P. polymyxa's 2,3-BDO production is the formation of by-products like lactate, formate, acetate, ethanol, and acetoin during pyruvate metabolism (Wu et al., 2018).  The use of lignocellulosic biomasses for 2,3-BDO production from alternative sources has been explored for the valorization of cheap and abundant agro-industrial by-products, such as brewer’s spend grain (BSG) from beer industry (Agrawal et al., 2023; Yang et al, 2016). The use of these biomasses pose challenges has the need of detoxification stage for the removal of microbial inhibitors arose from biomass pretreatment (Joo et al., 2016). In this research co-cultivation is proposed as sustainable solution to overcome the toxicity of biomass-based fermentation broth via bacterial remediation. The idea is to cultivate P. polymyxa with strains capable of metabolizing inhibitory compounds from biomass, such as furan aldehydes and phenolic compounds, for detoxification. The goal is to enable efficient sugar metabolism and 2,3-BDO production from BSG. In this experiment, co-cultivation involves P. polymyxa with Pseudomonas putida, a bacterium capable of metabolizing inhibitors (Medić & Karadžić, 2022; Hill & Robinson, 1975). The study aims to assess how the production dynamics of P. polymyxa change when co-cultivated with a strain that metabolize both inhibitors and sugars, or with a strain whose sugar metabolism is blocked. The experiment explores the impact of resource competition in co-culture dynamics and evaluates the need of using a non-competitive strain in co-cultivation to achieve detoxification of the fermentation broth and enhanced production of 2,3-BDO.    
 110 Aim of the experiment The experimented intended to understand the dynamic in co-cultivation of P. polymyxa coupled with a bacterium non-competing for sugars (the engineered P. putida) or a competitive bacterium (the wild-type P. putida), looking at production preferences between BDO and other by-products of the BDO synthetic pathway.   Experimental conditions The raw biomass (Brewers spent grain; BSG) was pretreated with dilute acid at 1:8 (w/v) solid:liquid ratio, at 155ºC, 17 min and 1.25% (w/v) sulfuric acid, using a Parr reactor (Parr Instr. Co., IL, USA) of 600 mL of internal volume (Mussatto & Roberto, 2005). After pretreatment liquid-solid fractions were screen-separated, and the solid subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis at 10% (w/v), in water adjusted at pH 4.8 (with NaOH pearls), at 50°C and 150 rpm for 48h, with enzyme load of 20 FPU g-1 dry matter (DM) of the cellulolytic enzymes cocktail Cellic® CTec2 (CC2, Novozymes, Denmark). The composition of the hemicellulosic hydrolysate (BSG-H), derived from pretreatment, and the enzymatic hydrolysate (EH) was quantified by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). HPLC was performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatograph UHPLC plus focused system (Dionex Softron GmbH, Germering, Germany). A refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101) and a Bio-Rad Aminex column HPX-87H (300 mm × 7.8 mm) (at 60ºC) were used, being 5 mM H2SO4 the mobile phase employed with a flow of 0.6 mL/min.  Two fermentation media were prepared by mixing BSG hydrolysate (BSG-H) and enzymatic hydrolysate (EH) in two different ratios: 3:1 and 1:1 BSG-H:EH. The sugar concentrations were maintained at 28.38 g/L glucose, 21.21 g/L xylose, and 9.75 g/L arabinose in both media. In the 3:1 ratio medium, the concentrations of inhibitory compounds (derived from the BSG-H) were: 1.8 g/L 5-HMF, 0.17 g/L furfural, 0.12 g/L formic acid, 0.95 g/L acetic acid, and 2.63 g/L total phenolic content. In the 1:1 ratio medium, the concentrations of inhibitors were: 1.2 g/L 5-HMF, 0.11 g/L furfural, 0.08 g/L formic acid, 0.64 g/L acetic acid, and 1.38 g/L total phenolic content. This ensured consistent sugar concentrations while varying the ratios of inhibitory compounds.  Three bacterial strains were used in this experiment: Paenibacillus polymyxa DSM 365 (P) from the German collection of microorganisms (DSMZ, Leibniz, Germany), a genetically engineered strain of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (E) provided by Systems Environmental  
 111 Microbiology group of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (Denmark Technical University, Denmark), and a wild-type P. putida KT2440. The genotype of the engineered P. putida is the following: ΔPP_0652, Δglk, ΔgtsABCD, Δgnuk, ΔgntT, Δgad, Δgcd, ΔkguT, ΔkguK, gfp. The introduced deletions make the strain unable to metabolize glucose, gluconate, and 2-keto-gluconate.  The microorganisms were grown independently using a pre-culture M9 minimal medium supplemented with 4% glucose to growth P. polymyxa and the wild-type P. putida or with 10 % sodium citrate dihydrate for the engineered P. putida (composition of M9 as reported in the Cold Spring Harbor Protocols). The pre-cultures were grown in shaking incubator Innova® 42 (New Brunswick, Germany) at their optimal temperature, 37ºC for P. polymyxa and 30ºC for P. putida, at 250 rpm for 24 h. The strains were inoculated at an initial OD of 0.05 in the fermentation media (3:1 and 1:1) as monoculture of P. polymyxa or co-cultures of P. polymyxa coupled with one of the two P. putida. The fermentations were carried out at 34°C (middle temperature between the two optimal temperatures) at 250 rpm at pH 6 in Erlenmeyer flask with final volume of 100 ml.  Sugar content and production profile of 2,3-BDO and other by-products, such as acetoin, ethanol, and lactic acid, were monitored by HPLC). Utilizing HPLC data, it was calculated the total number of carbon moles provided at the onset of fermentation. This analysis also assessed how these carbon moles were allocated to produce the desired product (2,3-BDO) and the by-products of the fermentation process. The distribution of carbon moles is visually presented in the graphs below (Figure 1) through two concentric circles: the inner circle depicts the proportion of carbon sources available at the initiation of fermentation based on the percentage dedicated to each carbon source, while the outer circle illustrates the percentage of carbon moles allocated to the products or unused carbon sources at the peak production of 2,3-BDO. The section labelled as "other" in the outer circle represents the unmeasured carbon generated through bacterial growth, including CO2 formation.  Results and discussion The results highlight significant variations in 2,3-BDO production in the two media and cultivation conditions. The only difference between the media is the presence of inhibitory compounds. All the inhibitors are more concentrated in the medium 3:1.  In the 1:1 ratio, when P. polymyxa is in monoculture, 46% of carbon moles are dedicated to 2,3-BDO production. However, in co-culture with wild-type P. putida, only 17% of carbon  
 112 is allocated to 2,3-BDO, while another 17% is directed towards acetoin production. The accumulation of acetoin signals oxygen depletion and reduction in NAD+/NADH (Lopez de Felipe et al., 1997). The decline in oxygen levels may be linked to the presence of P. putida in co-cultivation, depleting carbon sources and generating CO2 during growth with P. polymyxa. Competition for sugars could also contribute to by-product accumulation, as P. polymyxa can use a limited amount of glucose for BDO production from pyruvate.  In contrast, co-cultivation with engineered P. putida reveals a distinct pattern. This strain exclusively utilizes phenolics, not sugars, and this results in an improved environment with poor inhibitor-content. In this scenario, 59% of carbon sources were devoted to BDO production, and only 7% to acetoin. The peak concentration of 27.77 g/L BDO (59% of carbon moles) is achieved at 41 h in co-culture with engineered P. putida, while 8.1 g/L attained in co-culture with wild-type P. putida and 21.59 g/L in monoculture.  In the 3:1 medium, the maximum BDO production takes 72 h to be reached, hitting only 9.2 g/L (19%) in monoculture. However, co-culture with engineered P. putida exhibits higher production (15.71 g/L), representing 33% of carbon. The lower percentage of carbon dedicated to BDO in 3:1 may be attributed to the presence of inhibitors. Moreover, the enhanced production in co-culture with engineered P. putida suggests a mitigation of inhibitor content as a contributing factor to improved BDO production.       
 113  Figure 1. Utilization of carbon sources is represented as the percentage of moles of carbon used for product formation. The "y-axis" illustrates the fermentation media, the 3:1 ratio and 1:1 ratio of BSG Hy:EH. On the "x-axis," is depicted the type of cultivation, including P. polymyxa (P), P. polymyxa with wild-type P. putida (P + P. put), and P. polymyxa with engineered P. putida (P + E). The figure highlights the time point at which the highest concentration of 2,3-BDO was attained (expressed in g/L) for each condition.  Conclusions:  It is necessary to have in co-culture with P. polymyxa a strain that is not competing for the carbon-sources but have different nutritional requirements, to have enhanced production of BDO and non-significant accumulation of by-products. Moreover, bioremediation of the media from inhibitory compound has a positive effect on production of BDO.

Mussatto)  ABSTRACT  The use of lignocellulosic biomasses in fermentation processes poses many challenges as the inhibitory compounds formed during the biomass pretreatment step affect the microbial performance during fermentation. This study deals with the production of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) from brewer’s spent grain (BSG) by fermentation with Paenibacillus polymyxa, a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) bacterium. A comparative study on 2,3-BDO production from BSG via three saccharification and fermentation approaches was carried out: simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF). Monoculture and co-culture fermentation strategies with P. polymyxa and Pseudomonas putida were explored, with co-culture being proposed as a sustainable alternative to chemical detoxification of lignocellulosic hydrolysate medium. The results highlighted the efficacy of the SSCF approach, particularly when microbial detoxification by P. putida was employed, achieving a 2,3-BDO yield of 20.94 g/L. These findings represent a significant contribution for the implementation of sustainable bioprocesses for 2,3-BDO production from lignocellulosic biomass, solving the main issue arising from biomass pretreatment through the co-cultivation strategy.

Its production through microbial fermentation is considered environmentally friendly and contributes to the carbon-neutral economy, with 36% lower CO2 emissions than petroleum-based synthesis (Song et al., 2019; Rehman et al., 2021).  Many bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was first reported in the early 20th century (Harden & Walpole, 1906), Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus amyloliquefacien, Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Bacillus licheniformis, are well-known 2,3-BDO producers. Even though, K. pneumoniae produced the highest 2, 3-BDO concentration ever recorded (150 g/L) (Ma et al., 2009), the main concern is on the pathogenicity of this strain, so the interest of researchers is now dedicated to 2.3-BDO-producer’s strains with GRAS status, such as P. polymyxa.  Bacterial synthesis of 2,3-BDO is triggered by an acid environment to counteract pH decrease and to maintain the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio (Van Houdt et al., 2007). Extra acid supplementation has been shown to promote the 2,3-BDO metabolic pathway, indicating 2,3-BDO's role as a neutral metabolite to mitigate excessive intracellular acidification (Nakashimada et al., 2000). Therefore, 2,3-BDO formation involves Pyruvate, which can undergo reduction or oxidation to produce organic acids (lactate, formate, and acetate), ethanol, and acetoin (Yang et al., 2015). The formation of these by-products is the major challenge in 2,3-BDO production by P. polymyxa (Stoklosa et al., 2024). Most microorganisms produce 2,3-BDO by three consecutive metabolic steps: pyruvate to α-acetolactate, α-acetolactate to acetoin, and acetoin to 2,3-BDO (Figure 1). The process relies on three key enzymes: α-acetolactate synthase (ALS), α-acetolactate decarboxylase (α-ALD), and 2,3-BDO dehydrogenase or acetoin reductase (BDH, AR). Pyruvate can be converted into 4 different by-products: lactate (by L-/D-lactate dehydrogenase with NADH formation, LDH), α-acetolactate (via decarboxylation by acetolactate synthase, ALS), formate (by formate dehydrogenase, FDH), or acetyl-CoA (by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, ALDH). Furthermore, in the presence  
 118 of oxygen, α-acetolactate can be spontaneously decarboxylated into diacetyl, which can subsequently be converted into acetoin by diacetyl reductase (DAR) coupled with NADH oxidation. Otherwise, in a non-oxidated environment, α-acetolactate can be converted into acetoin by α-ALD. Lastly, acetoin can be converted into 2,3-BDO by BDH (Maina et al., 2022). The reaction of BDH is reversible. A decreased NAD+/NADH ratio can induce the formation of acetoin from BDO. Hence, the synthesis of 2,3-BDO can be considered as a strategy for carbon/energy storage.  Many studies have approached the enhancement of BDO yield and the development of a more sustainable bioprocess with diverse strategies: reducing the formation of by-products, improving bacterial productivity with genetic engineering, and optimizing the fermentation parameters. Utilization of cheap and abundant agro-industrial by-products, such as biomasses, remains the best alternative for the development of sustainable biomanufacturing.  Various substrates have been explored for 2,3-BDO production: sugarcane molasses and sugarcane bagasse, as well as alternative resources like corn stover hydrolysate and brewer’s spend grain (BSG) and other (Bai et al., 2023; Narisetty et al., 2022; Amraoui et al., 2021; Amraoui et al., 2022) Lignocellulosic biomasses pose challenges for 2,3-BDO production due to their complexity and the need for pretreatments to reduce cellulose crystallization and promote lignin disruption and hemicellulose depolymerization. However, the intensive pretreatments of biomass may lead to the formation of inhibitors, affecting fermentation.  In this work, it was performed a comparative study on the production of BDO from Brewer’s spent grain via three saccharification and fermentation approaches: Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF), Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF), Simultaneous Saccharification and Co-Fermentation (SSCF). The fermentations were operated in the monoculture of P. polymyxa and co-culture with P. putida. Co-culture is proposed as an alternative and sustainable strategy to the chemical detoxification of lignocellulosic-derived medium from inhibitory compounds generated via biomass pretreatment. In this work, it has been proved through strong evidence that enhanced production of 2,3-BDO (20.94 g/L) is achievable with SSCF of BSG, when the microbial detoxification of inhibitory compounds is operated by P. putida. This approach represents great progress in the efficient implementation of sustainable bioprocesses for 2,3-BDO production from lignocellulosic biomass.

 120 4.2.2 Diluted acid pretreatment The raw biomass was pretreated with dilute acid at 1:8 (w/v) solid:liquid ratio, at 155ºC, 17 min and 1.25% (w/v) sulfuric acid, using a Parr reactor (Parr Instr. Co., IL, USA) of 600 mL of internal volume (Mussatto & Roberto, 2005). The reaction was performed with 35 gr of biomass, and it was stopped by introducing the reactor to an ice-water bath for 30 minutes. Once the pretreatment was performed, liquid-solid fractions were screen-separated, being the residual solid used in separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). On the other hand, the slurry obtained in pretreatment (mixture of solid and liquid fractions) was submitted to simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF).  4.2.3 Microorganisms and pre-cultures Two bacterial strains were used in this work: Paenibacillus polymyxa DSM 365 (P) from the German collection of microorganisms (DSMZ, Leibniz, Germany) and a genetically engineered strain of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (E) provided by Systems Environmental Microbiology group of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (Denmark Technical University, Denmark). The genotype of engineered P. putida is the following: ΔPP_0652, Δglk, ΔgtsABCD, Δgnuk, ΔgntT, Δgad, Δgcd, ΔkguT, ΔkguK, gfp. The introduced deletions make the strain unable to metabolize glucose, gluconate, and 2-keto-gluconate. Before use, the two strains were stored as glycerol stock (40% sterile glycerol) at –80 ºC. The microorganisms were grown independently using a pre-culture M9 minimal medium composed of salt solution (12.8 g/L Na2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L NaCl, and 1 g/L NH4Cl), trace elements (0.05 g/L EDTA, 0.083 g/L FeCl3.6H2O, 0.084 mg/L ZnCl2, 0.013 mg/L CuCl2.2H2O, 0.01 mg/L CoCl2.6H2O, 0.01 mg/L HBO3, and 0.016 mg/L MnCl2.4H2O), 0.1 mM MgSO4, 0.01 mM CaCl2.2H2O, and supplemented with 4% glucose to growth P. polymyxa or with 10 % sodium citrate dihydrate for the engineered P. putida. The pre-cultures were grown in shaking incubator Innova® 42 (New Brunswick, Germany) at their optimal temperature (37ºC for P. polymyxa and 30ºC for P. putida), at 250 rpm for 24 h. 4.2.4 Fermentation in synthetic semi-defined medium Two synthetic semi-defined media (SM) were prepared with glucose and arabinose to perform monocultures with P. polymyxa (with 0.25 initial OD 600nm), or supplemented with  
 121 glucose, xylose, arabinose, and some phenolic compounds to perform 2-step co-fermentation of P. polymyxa coupled with engineered P. putida. The fermentations were performed in duplicate. In the 2-step co-cultivation, P. putida was first inoculated at an initial OD 600nm of 0.25, and after 20 h, P. polymyxa was also inoculated at the same initial OD.  Both semi-defined media were composed of 10 g/L yeast extract, 0.2 g/L MgSO4, 3 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6), and 3 mL trace elements (Okonkwo et al. 2017). The phosphate buffer (pH 6) contained (g/L): 3.5 KH2PO4 and 2.75 K2HPO4, while the trace element solution was prepared by dissolving 0.4 g FeSO4 in 3 mL 25% HCl, followed by the addition of 500 mL double-distilled H2O and (g): 0.8 H3BO3, 0.04 CuSO4·5H2O, 0.04 NaMoO4·2H2O, 5.0 MnCl2·4H2O, 0.1 ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.08 Co (NO3)2·6H2O, 1.0 CaCl2·2H2O, and 0.01 biotin.  The medium with glucose and arabinose (SM-AG) was prepared with 28 g/L and 8 g/L of the two sugars, respectively. In the medium with both sugars and phenolic compounds (SM-XAG-P), the composition was the following: 28 g/L glucose, 20 g/L xylose, 8 arabinose g/L, 0.44 g/L p-coumaric, 0.92 g/L ferulic, 0.21 g/L vanillin, and 0.425 g/L caffeic acid. The composition of SM-AG was decided to have both C5 and C6, by mistake was added only arabinose but no xylose at the concentration found in the hemicellulosic hydrolysate (BSG-Hy) generated from dilute acid hydrolysis of BSG.  Instead, SM-XAG-P was formulated as SM-AG supplemented with some of the main lignocellulose-derived phenolic compounds to have ~ 2 g/L in total at the proportions found in BSG-Hy. All the media were sterilized by filtration using 0.2 μm vacuum PES filter units (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Batch cultures were carried out in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 40 mL working volume or using a 2 L bench-top bioreactor Biostat ® B (Sartorius AG, Germany) filled with 800 mL.  During fermentation in the bioreactor, pH was monitored but not adjusted with a Hemilton probe (pH Sensor EASYFERM PLUS) from Sartorius. The bioreactor operated at 34 °C, at 100 rpm or 200 rpm with an air flow rate of 1 vvm on initial working volume for 72 h. The same conditions were used with flask experiments. During the fermentations, samples were collected to measure Optical Density at 600 nm (OD 600nm), HPLC analysis, and cell plating upon dilutions. All chemicals were of microbiological grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.   
 122 4.2.5 Separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) Firstly, pretreated BSG obtained from diluted acid hydrolysis was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis in an Erlenmeyer flask at 10% (w/v) of solid:liquid ratio, in water adjusted at pH 4.8 (with NaOH pearls) 50°C and 150 rpm for 48h. An enzyme load of 20 FPU g-1 dry matter (DM) of the cellulolytic enzymes cocktail Cellic® CTec2 (CC2, Novozymes, Denmark) was used. At the end of enzymatic hydrolysis, sugars were quantified by HPLC. Secondly, the enzymatic hydrolysate was fermented for 72 h. The SHF was performed in duplicate in P. polymyxa monoculture (SHF P) and co-culture (SHF P+E). The strains were inoculated at an initial OD of 0.25, and the fermentation conditions were as follows: 34°C, at 200 rpm, 1vvm on an initial working volume of 400 ml in 1-L bioreactor sterilized by autoclave (Biostat ® B, Sartorius AG, Germany), and at pH 6 without adjustment. Sugar content, growth profile (via plating), and production profile of 2,3-BDO and other by-products, such as acetoin, ethanol, and lactic acid, were monitored.  4.2.6 Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) In this process, the enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification) of pretreated BSG and fermentation was conducted at the same conditions explained for SHF (section 2.5), but bacterial strains were added together with the enzyme load in the same vessel. In this case, the hydrolysis was conducted in water at pH 6 to not affect fermentation. The entire process was carried out by duplicate for 72 h in a 1L-bioreactor sterilized by autoclavation. Sugar content, growth profile (via plating), and production profile of 2,3-BDO and other by-products, such as acetoin, ethanol, and lactic acid, were monitored as in SHF. The SSF was performed in P. polymyxa-monoculture (SSF P) and co-culture (SSF P+E). The strains were inoculated at an initial OD of 0.25, 4.2.7 Simultaneous Saccharification and Co-Fermentation (SSCF) All batch SSCF experiments were carried out in duplicates with 1-L bioreactor Biostat ® B (Sartorius AG, Germany) or 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks sterilized by autoclavation. The BSG slurry from acid pretreatment (mixture of pretreated BSG and hemicellulosic hydrolysate) was used directly after pretreatment, upon pH adjustment to 6 with NaOH pearls. 20 FPU of the cellulolytic enzyme cocktail Cellic® CTec2 was loaded for each g of dry matter (DM). To keep the solid:liquid ratio of 10% (w/v) between biomass and hydrolysate, a portion of  
 123 hemicellulosic liquid was removed based on the percentage of dry biomass lost after pretreatment due to fiber hydrolyzation. All SSCF experiments were carried out by duplicate at 34°C, 200 rpm, 1vvm on an initial working volume of 400 ml and pH 6 for 72h. The SSCF was performed in P. polymyxa-monoculture (SSCF P) and co-culture (SSCF P+E). The strains were inoculated at an initial OD of 0.25, simultaneously at the beginning of fermentation or sequentially (firstly P. putida at t=0 and secondly P. polymyxa at t=20h). Samples were taken repeatedly throughout the SSCF. Sugar content, growth profile (via plating), and production profile of 2,3-BDO and other by-products, such as acetoin, ethanol, and lactic acid, were monitored as in SHF and SSF 4.2.8 Cell plating and optical density measurements Bacterial growth was assessed by measurement of the optical density (OD) at 600 nm with 1mL cuvette on a ULTROSPEC® 10 CELL DENSITY METER spectrophotometer (Biochrom, UK). For OD measurements samples were properly diluted to be in the linearity of the equipment. The same samples were also plated to allow colony counting. Samples of the various fermentations were serially diluted and 100 µL of the prover dilution was plated in LB agar (16 g/L agar, 10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract). Dilutions were calculated assuming that as for E. coli, 1 OD of P. putida and P. polymyxa corresponded to 8*108 cells/mL (Mira et al., 2022). In the co-cultivation, the two bacteria were distinguished based on their phenotypes, and the presence of each strain in the samples was plotted as percentages.  4.2.9 Analytical methods BSG was characterized with The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analytical methodology (Sluiter et al., 2011, 2008, 2005). The total starch content was analyzed by the “Total Starch Assay Kit” method (Megazyme, Ireland). For quantifications of sugars, 2,3-BDO, acetoin, ethanol, weak acid (as lactic, formic, and acetic acid), and 5-HMF was used High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatograph UHPLC + focused system (Dionex Softron GmbH, Germering, Germany), with a refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101) and a Bio-Rad Aminex column HPX-87H (300 mm × 7.8 mm) (at 60ºC), being 5 mM H2SO4 the mobile phase employed with a flow of 0.6 mL/min. The content of phenolic compounds was determined with an HPLC system equipped with µBondapakTM c18 10µM 125a 3.9X300mm Column (WatersTM, Denmark), at a flow of 0.7 mL/min of mobile phase A (acetonitrile) and mobile  
 124 phase B (4% acetic acid in water) in gradient started from minute 0 to 20 min, at 30 ºC and wavelength 280 nm. At 0 min, the gradient was 5% A: 95% B, then at 10-min A was 10 %, at 17-min 15% A: 85% B, and finally at 22-min 25% A: 75% B. The total content of phenolic compounds was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method (Ballesteros et al., 2014). Analytical determinations were carried out in triplicate or duplicate for HPLC data, and the average results are shown.   4.3 Results and discussion  4.3.1 Biomass characterization BSG was analyzed to determine its composition. The composition was (% w/w dry matter): 16.14 ± 0.1, cellulose; 14.2 ± 0.04, hemicellulose; 21.46 ± 2.12, lignin; 9.19 ± 0.45, extractives; 3.43 ± 0.01, ash; 0.16 ± 0.0, acetyl groups; 10.48 ± 0.93, fat; 5.17 ± 0.18, starch; 19.41 ± 0.13, protein. In other studies, the composition of BSG was determined as follows:  16-25% cellulose, 16-30% hemicellulose, 13-26% lignin, 2-20% extractives, 11-22% proteins, and 1-5% ashes (Laine et al., 2015; Herbst et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2018; Amorim et al., 2018). In these studies, starch was not quantified, and it could have been considered as part of cellulose portion.  The raw material was subjected to dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment, efficiently solubilizing the hemicellulosic fraction contained in the raw BSG. It was found a total of 32.46 g/L of sugars at the following composition: 16.39 ± 0.54 g/L xylose, 8.1 ± 0.05 g/L glucose, and 7.96 ± 0.11 g/L arabinose. Xylose was the most abundant sugar extracted from the hemicellulosic fraction, being 50.5% of the total sugar content of the BSG hydrolysate (BSG Hy). After the pretreatment, antimicrobial compounds were also found in hemicellulosic hydrolysate: total phenolic compounds, 2.41 g/L; formic acid, 0.08 g/L; acetic acid, 0.60 g/L; 5-HMF, 1.28 g/L; furfural, 0.12 g/L. In a recent study (Okonkwo et al., 2021) was successfully producing 2,3-BDO from P. polymyxa in a non-detoxified hydrolysate of wheat straw with a considerably lower phenolic compounds concentration (~0.5 g/L) compared to the BSG hydrolysate used in this study. During lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment, acetic acid is usually generated from the hemicellulosic structure, while phenolic compounds originated due to the partial breakdown of lignin (Kumar et al., 2020). In this pretreatment, 5-HMF and furfural are generated from the degradation of hexoses and pentoses, and formic acid was liberated from further degradation of these furan aldehydes (Kumar V. et al., 2020).   
 125 4.3.2 Production of 2,3-BDO in synthetic medium with glucose and arabinose  The experimental setting aimed at examining the potential of P. polymyxa in producing 2,3-BDO in a medium containing both C5 and C6 is essential to understanding the dynamic between the carbon source availability and specificity and the product synthesis. In this experiment in the bioreactor, glucose was used as the primary source. Within the initial 17 h, 59,6% of glucose was metabolized, while arabinose remained unutilized. Subsequently, in the time between 17 and 24 h, only 3.12 g/L glucose persisted, and a significant portion of arabinose (33%) was utilized, leading to the complete consumption of both sugars within 48 h (Figure 2). The maximum optical density at 600 nm (OD 600nm) was achieved at 24 h (7.2), followed by a decline in cell density despite the reduction in available sugars (Figure 2). The growth profile suggested a potential metabolic shift or adaptation to nutrient depletion. 2,3-BDO exhibited accumulation until 48 h, followed by a subsequent decrease in the final 24 h. Since sugars were partially simultaneously metabolized, product synthesis was slowed down by the diauxic effect between the 17th and 24th h of fermentation. However, the ability of P. polymyxa to co-use pentose and hexose represents the optimal phenotype for the bacterium for efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic feedstocks (Kim et al., 2010).  P. polymyxa utilizes acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (AR/2,3-BDH) for the conversion of R-acetoin to R,R-2,3-BDO, the purest form of this compound. This enzymatic process involves NADH as a coenzyme. Notably, the AR/2,3-BDH enzyme in P. polymyxa is reversible, pointing out its significance in maintaining high acetoin reduction activity for efficient R,R-2,3-BDO production.  When fermentation medium carbon sources are abundant, the enzyme's reducing activity gradually increases. Conversely, upon depletion of the carbon source, the reducing activity declines, and oxidative activity gradually takes precedence. This enzymatic shift results in a decrease in 2,3-BDO and an increase in acetoin levels (Ju et al., 2023). This dynamic behavior highlights the importance of managing carbon source availability to sustain optimal enzymatic activity for desired product outcomes.  Over the last 24 h of fermentation, acetoin levels increased from 1.17 g/L to 3.62 g/L. Small quantities of ethanol (1.62 g/L) were initially accumulated within the first 17 h, maintaining a nearly constant level until 48 h when it was consumed. At the 48-h time point, when the maximum 2,3-BDO concentration was achieved (13.4 g/L with a production rate of 0.279 g/L/h), 40.6% of the available carbon moles were directed towards butanediol production, while only 4.89% are dedicated to ethanol and 2.7% to acetoin (Figure 3).  
 126 However, at 72 h, there was a 10% reduction in carbon moles dedicated to 2,3-BDO, with an increase in the allocation towards acetoin (8.4%) and a further decrease in the ethanol portion (1.46%). Understanding the temporal changes in carbon allocation provides insights into the metabolic shifts and priorities of the microbial culture over the fermentation duration, where maximum priority is given to the production of 2,3-BDO. Indeed, the production of 2,3-BDO is energetically convenient. In glycolysis, one mole of glucose yields two moles of NADH and two moles of pyruvate. In contrast, the synthesis of one mole of 2,3-BDO consumes two moles of pyruvate and one mole of NADH. From the overall perspective of glucose metabolism, the synthesis of 2,3-BDO results in a net of one mole NADH (Meng et al., 2021). However, the reduction of acetoin to produce 2,3-BDO is catalyzed by NADH-requiring 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase. This suggests that the partial pathway culminating in acetoin is preferred for NADH generation over 2,3-BDO synthesis Therefore, when carbon sources are terminating, the bacterium prefers to accumulate acetoin and save NADH molecules.

The inner circle of each pie chart presents the %total moles of Carbon at time 0 as presented in the table, the external circle presents the corresponding percentages at 48 h (A) and 72 h (B). The category labeled "other," denotes the percentage of carbon moles assigned to various other products generated during the fermentation, such as cell biomass and CO2. 4.3.3 Two-step co-culture in synthetic medium with C5-C6 sugars and phenolic compounds The bacterium P. polymyxa can metabolize both pentose and hexose sugar for its growth and its metabolic pathways. The production of 2,3-BDO and other metabolic products is influenced by the choice of available carbon sources and the C/N ratio in the medium (Liu et al., 2019). Currently, it is studied the production of 2,3-BDO from renewable resources from agroindustry, such as oat hull and spruce bark biomass, to valorize these residues and to develop low CO2 emission bioprocess (Hazeena et al., 2022).  The primary challenge in agro-industrial feedstock utilization is optimizing fermentation medium composition for maximum fermentable sugars while minimizing inhibitory phenolic compounds content from lignin degradation. In this context, the following data were gathered to characterize the behavior of P. polymyxa concerning both C5 and C6 sugars, alongside prevalent phenolic compounds derived from BSG. This experiment was performed in 1L-
 
 128 reactor and 0.1L-flask at the following conditions: 34 °C, 100rpm 1 vvm on the initial volume. Both in single culture and in co-culture with P. putida engineered to not metabolize glucose, gluconate, and k-gluconate.  Cocultivations were performed in a 2-step process, initially P. putida was inoculated followed by P. polymyxa after a 20-h delay. The co-cultivation strategy was applied to exploit the well-known ability of P. putida to degrade phenolic compounds (Khraisheh et at., 2020; Plaggenborg et al., 2003; Ravi et al., 2017) and achieve bioremediation of the fermentation medium. In monoculture, in both settings (flask and reactor), P. polymyxa was not growing, likely due to inhibition by the presence of approximately 2 g/L of phenolic compounds in the media.  Okonkwo et al. (2021) obtained 23.4 g/L of 2,3-BDO from non-detoxified wheat straw hydrolysate containing a considerably lower phenolic compound concentration (0.571 g/L). In the flask, the 2-step strategy in flask showed to be essential for overcoming inhibitory factors, allowing improved growth conditions for P. polymyxa (Figure 4). Growth and product formation were achieved also in the 1L-bioreactor when impeller rotation was brought to 200 rpm, with a 2,3-BDO production reaching a maximum of 7.68 g/L after 52 h from the inoculation of P. polymyxa (Figure 5). The growth profile, in Figure 4, reveals the two distinct phases: the monoculture of P. putida, until 20 h of fermentation, and the co-culture coupled with P. polymyxa, after 20 h. Sugar consumption was evident solely for glucose between 48 h and 72 h (corresponding to 28 and 52h of P. polymyxa). The fermentation was limited to 72h (52 h for P) due to the observation in monoculture that the maximum 2,3-BDO levels were attained upon complete consumption of glucose within 48 h of growth. In this case, the maximum concentration was 6.14 g/L of BDO with a production rate of 0.118 g/L/h (half of the previous data in monoculture).  The presence of inhibitory compounds might have affected the performance of P. polymyxa, even if the in-situ bioremediation operated by P. putida has reduced 43.07% of total phenolic compounds (Table 1). Particularly, vanillin was reduced to 16.45 mg/L at 72h from 219.46 mg/L at 2 h (at the initiation of fermentation). Also, p-coumaric acid was strongly depleted, as well as ferulic which was completely consumed. However, it was not possible to quantify caffeic acid consumption and its potential contribution to the overall dynamics of phenolic compound transformations during fermentation can be only speculated. The method for the quantification of this compound by HPLC should be improved in future studies.   
 129 A substantial accumulation of vanillic acid was observed, likely resulting from the conversion of vanillic acid, which was provided in the medium but could be also derived from the catabolized ferulic acid (Narbad et al., 1998; Kaur et al., 2013).  The growth of P. putida, proved by colony counting (Figure 6), and the absence of sugar consumption in the first 20 h, demonstrated that the bacterium relays on phenolic compound metabolization. Figure 6 reveals a dynamic shift in the bacterial population within the bioreactor, changing from predominantly P. putida to P. polymyxa. This switch is most likely due to a dominance of P. polymyxa related to a larger availability of carbon sources for the latter compared to P. putida. Many bacteria use contact-dependent killing machinery to eliminate competitors in their ecological habitats (Benz and Meinhart, 2014). P. putida, which in nature shares the same environment as P. polymyxa, the rhizosphere, can employ a type IVB secretion system to deliver a toxic effector to a broad spectrum of soil and plant-associated bacteria to kill them (Purtschert-Montenegro et al., 2022). The hypothesis of the coexistence of these two bacteria without competitive inhibition is supported by their shared presence on plates, where in most cases the two strains were growing one on top of the other (Figure 6). Moreover, the adaptability of P. polymyxa to the environment appeared contingent on the detoxification actions of P. putida. This finding reinforces the efficacy of co-cultivation as a robust strategy to overcome phenolic inhibition and suggests a potential avenue for further exploration and optimization of co-culture dynamics.

 131 4.3.4 Production of 2,3-BDO in monoculture and co-culture comparing SSF vs SHF Upon confirming the advantageous role of co-cultivation in media containing inhibitory compounds, such as phenolic compounds derived from lignocellulose and furan aldehydes from sugars, a comparative study was conducted using lignocellulosic biomass, specifically BSG. The aim was to explore the potential of utilizing this agroindustry by-product for bacterial fermentation, focusing on the production of 2,3-BDO by a natural P. polymyxa, thereby adding value to the biomass. Recently, the cellulosic fraction of BSG was used by a mutant strain of Enterobacter ludwigii high-level BDO production in fed-batch fermentation, where glucose level was kept over 20 g/L during the process (Amraoui et al., 2022).  In this work, instead, was performed a batch-fermentation, comparing simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) vs separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF). However, since inhibitory compounds were expected, to overcome the criticism about the use of lignocellulose-derived media, characterized by the accumulation of inhibitory compounds alongside sugars, co-culture fermentation was employed.  Based on the results discussed above, the engineered P. putida was introduced to remove any inhibitory compounds, facilitating the proper growth of P. polymyxa and ensuring adequate production of 2,3-BDO. As a control, monoculture fermentation of P. polymyxa under the same conditions was also conducted to assess the benefits of co-cultivation in this context.  The advantage of SHF is that hydrolysis and fermentation are operated at their optimal conditions, while in SSF the combination of these two steps in one allows shorter operational time. Moreover, in SHF, a significant challenge arises during biomass saccharification, as the glucose produced could strongly inhibit cellulase activity (end-product inhibition), particularly the β-glucosidase component responsible for hydrolyzing cellobiose to glucose. Cellobiose itself also inhibits cellulases, leading to a substantial reduction in the reaction rate (Hong et al., 1981; Mussatto et al., 2008).  In contrast, the SSF of lignocellulosic biomass allows the rapid conversion of glucose to products and minimizes substrate-product inhibition (Alfani et al., 2000), offering high production rates, as confirmed by the data displayed in Figure 8. Examining the total sugar consumption (Figure 7) both fermentations, SSF and SHF, revealed no difference between monoculture and co-culture. The data of cell-counting confirm that P. polymyxa was the only strain exhibiting growth, as it was the sole organism capable of utilizing the sugar released through enzymatic hydrolysis during saccharification, and as expected in none of the fermentations was measured any lignin-derived inhibitory compound. The distinction between  
 132 the two strategies lies in the fact that in SHF, all sugars hydrolyzed from the biomass are accumulated before fermentation starts (as evidenced by the total sugars reaching 20 g/L at time 0), instead, in SSF, sugars accumulate while being simultaneously metabolized by the growing bacterium.   
 Figure 7. SSF vs SHF of BSG by co-cultivation of P. polymyxa (P) with engineered P. putida (E) and monoculture of P in a 1-L bioreactor. Sugars consumption profile (A and B), and cell counting in Colony Forming Unit CFU/ml. Experimental conditions: 34 ºC, 200 rpm, 1 vvm, initial OD 600 0.25. Standard deviations are expressed as error bars.   The production profiles of 2,3-BDO, acetoin, and ethanol revealed minimal differences between monoculture and co-culture, except for ethanol production in SHF. Even if the concentration achieved (about 2.5 g/L) in ethanol production may seem low, the difference between monoculture and co-culture is considered relevant. However, more investigations on the trigger of ethanol accumulation must be done to explain this behavior in by-product synthesis. Instead, there is a notable difference between the two fermentation types in the production of 2,3-BDO and acetoin. In SSF, 2,3-BDO production is concurrent with acetoin accumulation, while in SHF, 2,3-BDO initially accumulates and then slowly decreases after 24 h until completely substituted by the formation of acetoin. In SSF, 2,3-BDO reaches a peak of 11 g/L, while the maximum 
 
 133 obtained in SHF is 9 g/L. The accumulation of acetoin peaks at the end of fermentation involves both cases, with less than 4 g/L in SSF and over 12 g/L in SHF. In this specific case, co-cultivation is not an advantage, because there were no inhibitory compounds generated during the saccharification of the sugars. Being the initial concertation of sugars the major difference in the two processes, the data presented in Figure 8 highlight the substrate-dose dependency of 2,3-BDO production (Häßler et al., 2012). However, the regulation of intracellular carbon flux and the increase of NADH/NAD+ ratio can amplify the metabolic flux toward 2,3-BDO production (Lu et al., 2022).  The formation of 2,3-BDO initiates with pyruvate converted into α-acetolactate and continues with two reactions both leading 2,3-BDO through reduction of acetoin with NADH oxidation (Juni and Heym, 1957; Blomqvist et al., 1993). The observed accumulation of acetoin (Figure 8) is the response of the cell to energy demand due to carbon depletion expressed in the consumption of sugars (Figure 7). In SHF, the response (2,3-BDO oxidation coupled with NAD+ reduction) was as fast as it was in sugar metabolism. The application of microbial electrosynthesis and electrofermentation can improve the yield of BDO from P. polymyxa by regulating the cellular redox balance via interaction with an electrode. Regardless of the major carbon metabolic pathway (glycolysis), the effect of electrical enhancement is typically assumed to result in an increase or decrease of intracellular redox factors such as NADH or NADPH (Venkata Mohan et al., 2014). Being able to direct the electron flow, it could be possible to maintain the metabolic flux toward BDO and avoid oxidation of it into acetoin, even when carbon sources and NADH are limited. Therefore, even if it was observed the synthesis of by-products, it is remarkable that both cases allow obtaining at an early stage of the fermentation (after 12h) high quantities of 2,3-BDO from non-valorized biomass, showing a productivity of 0.916 g/L/h and 0.75 g/L/h, in SSF and SHF, respectively.

Standard deviations are expressed as error bars.  4.3.5 Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF)  In this process, the fermentation medium derived nearly the final concentration of xylose and arabinose from the slurry generated during diluted acid hydrolysis. Xylose concentration slightly increased from 16.6 g/L to 18.25 g/L within 17 h of enzymatic hydrolysis (Figure 9). During SSCF, the saccharification of the pretreated biomass generated mainly glucose, which increased from 7.52 g/L, in the BSG hydrolysate, to 26.14 g/L in the first 17-h reaction.  The efficiency of the cellulolytic enzymes cocktail was potentially underestimated due to the simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation of sugars by P. polymyxa. In the case of SSCF, both solid residue and liquid fraction of pretreated BSG are used. Therefore, in the medium, a certain number of inhibitory compounds from the degradation of sugar and lignin during pretreatment was found. To overcome the toxicity of the medium, it was again used the co-culture strategy. As in previous experiments, the engineered P. putida strain was supplemented to the fermentation, since it is well known for its ability to grow using lignocellulose-derived phenolics and furan aldehydes as the sole carbon source (Mohammad et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2019). The sensor compound for P. putida detoxification activity was 5-HMF: its consumption was used as an indicator of the bioremediation efficiency of the bacterium.  
 
 135 It was reported that in some Gram-positive bacteria, 5-HMF inhibits biofilm formation affecting the quorum sensing pathway, which promotes responses to environmental stimuli (Vijayakumar et al., 2018). The anti-QS effect of 5-HMF can impact on P. polymyxa gene expression pattern at the population level (Voichek et al., 2020). In Figure 10, consumption of 5-HMF (2.66 g/L) was faster in co-culture than in monoculture showing, that P. polymyxa can partially metabolize 5-HMF, but the complete consumption of this inhibitory compound (between 20 and 24 h of fermentation) can be achieved only via bioremediation operated by P. putida.  In the co-culture, P. putida initially dominated the population, gradually giving way to a predominance of P. polymyxa as the fermentation progressed. This shift in population dynamics hints at a potential advantage of P. putida associated with a faster growth rate during the early stages of fermentation (Figure 11). The growth of P. polymyxa is mediated by the metabolism of sugars. The strain showed a preference for glucose over xylose and arabinose, but the C5 sugars were co-fermented. The bacterium showed a rapid adaptation to the diversity of the available carbon sources governed by carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Recently it was published that glucose in the medium downregulates xylose-operon, reducing the expression of the essential gene for xylose metabolism (Didak Ljubas et al., 2022). However, the % of consumption of xylose and arabinose differed substantially, 38% and 55.6%, respectively. This difference in consumption could be due to a dose effect, being xylose being more concentrated could inhibit the bacterial metabolic pathways. In the flask experiment, there was a difference in glucose accumulation during the saccharification of the cellulosic fraction of the pretreated biomass. In co-culture glucose peaked at 14.73 g/L in 17 h, while in monoculture 23.83 g/L. Between the two cases, there was a faster consumption of glucose in co-culture than in monoculture, and only in co-culture, there was complete consumption. Even if the two bacteria were not competing for the same carbon sources, co-culture could be advantageous for both due to the exchange of metabolites or for cell-cell communication, which can modify the dynamic of each other’s metabolism. Co-culture was beneficial for inhibitor removal. An additional confirmation of the importance of detoxification of the fermentation medium was given by 2,3-BDO production performances in monoculture vs co-culture (Figure 12). Synthesis of 2,3-BDO exclusively occurred in co-culture, reaching concentrations of 21.05 g/L and 3.91 g/L with a productivity of 0.44 g/L/h and 0.05 g/L/h in reactor and flask, respectively. Also, the highest concentrations of acetoin are reached in co-culture, but production occurred in both cases. When the maximum concertation of BDO was achieved the percentage of sugar  
 136 consumption was around 61.7%, in the reactor, and 65.77% in the flask, while in monoculture the consumption was complete in both types of fermentation (Table 2).  When 2,3-BDO was not produced, the carbon sources were dedicated to the synthesis of lactic acid, which accumulated up to 44.42 g/L (Table 2). In oxygen depletion, the electron transports (NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH) are accumulated in the cell in their reduced form, therefore in this microaerobic environment, the 2 moles of pyruvate generated through glycolysis are converted into organic acid, lactic, acetic, and formic acid, or ethanol (Schilling et al., 2020).  Further investigations are required to elucidate the factors leading to the fate of pyruvate towards the accumulation of specific organic acids, ethanol, or 2,3-BDO. Yang et al. (2015) genetically engineered a 2,3-BDO-producing B. subtilis for redistributing the carbon flux towards 2,3-BDO by manipulating NADH levels. NADH oxidase was disrupted by the insertion of a formate dehydrogenase gene (fdh), and then lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhA) was disrupted with insertional mutation to avoid accumulation of lactate, one of the main by-products competing with 2,3-BDO for pyruvate (Ge et al., 2020).

 139 4.4 Conclusion and future prospective This study demonstrated the efficacy of the co-culture strategy with P. polymyxa and engineered P. putida, to enhance lignocellulosic biomass conversion to 2,3-BDO by overcoming inhibitory compounds toxicity through efficient detoxification. This approach facilitated the significant increase of 2,3-BDO production compared to monoculture. These results represent an important contribution to the development of a sustainable bioprocess for 2,3-BDO production from lignocellulosic biomass, as it solves the main issue arising from biomass pretreatment through the co-cultivation strategy.  Future research should focus on optimizing the co-culture conditions between P. polymyxa and engineered P. putida. Moreover, the application of the co-cultivation strategy with various lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as agricultural residues or dedicated energy crops, can broaden the scope of the study and assess the versatility of the approach when applied to different types of biomasses. To favor 2,3-BDO synthesis over other by-products, electrofermentation could also be exploited to control the cellular redox balance. Additionally, conducting a techno-economic assessment to calculate the overall cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, and environmental impact of the process is essential to verify the potential industrial implementation of the co-cultivation strategy, as well as to identify possible points that should be improved to facilitate the upscaling process.

Mussatto)  ABSTRACT This study focused on the economic assessment of two fermentation processes for 2,3-butanediol (BDO) production from brewer's spent grain (BSG). The processes involved the pretreatment of BSG with diluted acid, followed by either simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) or simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) by Paenibacillus polymyxa alone or in co-culture with Pseudomonas putida. The economic analysis included the calculation of the Economic Potential (EPI/O), taking into account product and by-product values, raw material costs, and utility costs. The scenarios were designed to achieve a biomass-based manufacturing approach, aligning with the principles of the circular economy. The study also considered the production of electricity from waste solids (lignin) through combustion. Results showed that, before heat integration, both scenarios exhibited a negative EPI/O, indicating a lack of profitability primarily due to high energy costs associated with utilities. The main contributors to utility costs were identified as low-pressure steam (LPS), medium-pressure steam (MPS), and high-pressure steam (HHPS). The separation of 2,3-BDO from the solvent through distillation was identified as an energy-intensive stage. In the SSCF process, the production of electricity from the residual fuel stream, methane, and solid partially offsets the energy costs. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the prices of natural  
 148 gas, 2,3-BDO, and electricity significantly influence the economic performance of the processes. The SSCF scenario proved to be more resilient to higher natural gas prices and exhibited higher sensitivity to 2,3-BDO prices due to its superior product yield. After heat integration, the SSCF process showed a positive net revenue, suggesting the economic feasibility of BDO production via SSCF from BSG. In conclusion, the study emphasized the economic potential of 2,3-BDO production from BSG through SSCF, highlighting the importance of heat integration and the need to consider varying market prices in economic assessments. The findings provide valuable insights for progressing in economically viable BDO production from renewable resources.  Keywords: 2,3-Butanediol (BDO; 2,3-BDO), Brewer’s spent grain (BSG), Techno Economical assessment    5.1 Introduction 2,3-Butanediol (BDO) is a versatile C4 platform chemical with extensive applications across the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries (Maina et al., 2022; Vivek et al., 2022). It is an odorless, colorless, and transparent liquid when kept at room temperature (~23ºC). The high commercial value of BDO can be also attributed to its valued and useful derivatives, including 1,3-butadiene, acetoin, and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) (Adhikari et al., 2020; Nakazono et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2022). Moreover, BDO demonstrates a promising potential as a biofuel and as an additive in gasoline engines, having a heating value (27,189 J/g) similar to those of methanol and ethanol, 22,100 J/g and 29,100 J/g, respectively (Jeong et al., 2023).  The global market size was valued at US$ 270.4 Mn (million) in 2023, and it is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.5% in the next 8 years, reaching US$ 363.9 Mn by the end of 2031 (https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/2-3-butanediol-market.html). Presently, the synthesis of BDO is mainly carried out from fossil-derived oil via petroleum cracking at 700-800 ºC, to obtain a racemic mixture formed by (2R,3R)-2,3-BDO, (2S,3S)-2,3-BDO, and (2R,3S)-2,3-BDO (Bai et al., 2023). The associated environmental issues and the rapid depletion of fossil-derived oils dragged the fast transition to BDO production through renewable resources and bio-based fermentation.  Since 1906, the microbial production of BDO has been largely studied, and high-yield production has been achieved by various wild-type and genetically engineered microorganisms  
 149 such as Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Serratia sp., Paenebacillus sp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Harden & Walpole, 1906; Barrett et al., 1983; Tinôco et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2017; Lee et al. 2021). Hence, the implementation of fermentative BDO from first-generation feedstock (glucose) and second-generation feedstock (i.e., corn stover, wheat straw, oil palm empty bunches, lignocellulosic biomasses) represents the most promising practice for the future diol industry (Yang et al., 2016; Adlakha et al., 2016; Hazeena et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2015). Most of the bacterial isolates reported for BDO production can utilize lignocellulose biomass-derived C6 and C5 sugars as the substrates (Cen et al., 2022).  Lastly, researchers have dedicated many efforts to valorization and adding value to the major by-product of the beer industry, brewer’s spent grain (BSG). Currently, this biomass, which is abundant and annually renewable, is poorly exploited since it is used as animal feed or biogas production, and the excess is disposed of as landfills, but with a largely unexplored potential (Mussatto, 2014; Bachmann et al., 2022; Buffington, 2014). Being beer one of the most used beverages in the world, BSG production has a large scale. In 2022, European countries produced almost 35.9 billion (bn) liters of beer, between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beer, with an increase of 7% from 2021 Among the EU countries with data available, Germany continued to be the top producer with 7.6 bn liters (more than 22% of the total EU production), followed by Spain, with 3.9 bn liters produced (more than 11% of total EU production), Poland with 3.7 bn liters (11%) the Netherlands with 2.6 bn liters (almost 8%) and France and Italy, both with 2.0 billion liters (each 6%) (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/). Approximately 20 kilograms of BSG are generated for every 100 liters of beer produced (Reinold, 1997). The average price of BSG is ∼ US$50/ton (Mailaram et al, 2022).  The establishment of a biorefinery to produce a high-value product as BDO via a low-carbon manufacturing approach would be in line with the principle of circular economy and maximize the gains of breweries (Rehmen, 2022). Several critical points can be identified in the production of BDO via a microbial route successful scale-up and commercialization: low cost of the utilities (feedstock, enzymes, and energy), the titers and the strain efficiency in conversion of BSG to BDO, and the percentage of recovery.  However, the feasibility of the process on the commercial scale can be assessed by techno-economic assessment (TEA) in each stage of the process.  Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the costs and calculate the profitability of two fermentation processes to produce BDO from BSG by Paenibacillus polymyxa. In the two processes, the biomass was pretreated with diluted acid, and either the pretreated biomass or the liquid-solid slurry was used in scenarios A or B, respectively.  
 150 Scenario A consisted of simultaneous saccharification (enzymatic hydrolysis) and fermentation (SSF) by P. polymyxa of the pretreated BSG. In scenario B the pretreated biomass together with the hydrolysate generated during pretreatment were subjected to simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) by a co-culture system of P. polymyxa with Pseudomonas putida. The bacteria in co-cultivation had 2 different roles: to operate as bioremediation of the phenolic compounds and other inhibitors generated in the BSG hydrolysate after pretreatment (P. putida) and to ferment the C5 and C6 sugars into 2,3-BDO (P. polymyxa).  The use of pretreatment facilitates the effective exploitation of the biomass allowing the saccharification of BSG; however, it causes the release of inhibitory compounds from the disruption of lignin and the degradation of sugars (Martin et al., 2022). The processes were designed based on the experimental results obtained previously (Chapter 4). The simulations for mass and energy balances were carried out using Aspen Plus software. The outcomes of the mass/energy balances obtained from simulations were used for the economic calculation of the processes.   5.2 Methodology 5.2.1 Experimental data and process design  Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) was kindly supplied by the Carlsberg Breweries (Copenhagen, Denmark). It was stored at −80 °C until use. For characterization of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, extractives, and ash content, BSG was ground with Polymix PX-MFC90 D (Kinematica AG, Switzerland) hammer mill into particles of 2 mm. BSG was characterized according to The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analytical methodology (Sluiter et al., 2011, 2008, 2005). The total starch content was analyzed by the “Total Starch Assay Kit” method (Megazyme, Ireland). The raw biomass was pretreated with dilute acid at 1:8 (w/v) solid:liquid ratio, at 155 ºC, 17 min, and 1.25% (w/v) sulfuric acid, using a Parr reactor (Parr Instr. Co., IL, USA) of 600 mL of internal volume. The reaction was performed with 35 g of biomass, and it was stopped by introducing the reactor to an ice-water bath for 30 min. Once the pretreatment was performed, liquid-solid fractions were screen-separated, being the residual solid used in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). On the other hand, the slurry obtained after pretreatment (mixture of solid and liquid fractions) was submitted to simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF).  
 151 In the SSF process, the enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification) of pretreated BSG solid and fermentation were conducted in the same vessel (2-L bioreactor Biostat ® B (Sartorius AG, Germany). In this case, the hydrolysis was conducted in water at pH 6 to not affect fermentation, at 10% (w/v) of solid:liquid ratio, in water adjusted at pH 6 (with NaOH pearls). An enzyme load of 20 FPU g-1 dry matter (DM) of the cellulolytic enzymes cocktail Cellic® CTec2 (CC2, Novozymes, Denmark) was used. The entire process was carried out by duplicate for 72 h. In the fermentation, it was supplemented 10 g/L yeast extract, and 3 g/L (NH4)2SO4 as nitrogen sources. Sugar content, growth profile (via plating), and production profile of 2,3-BDO and other by-products, such as acetoin, ethanol, and lactic acid, were monitored. The SSF was carried out using a monoculture of P. polymyxa (SSF P). The strain was inoculated at an initial OD of 0.25. All batch SSCF experiments were carried out in duplicates with 1-L bioreactor Biostat ® B (Sartorius AG, Germany) sterilized by autoclavation. The BSG slurry from acid pretreatment (mixture of pretreated BSG and hemicellulosic hydrolysate) was used directly after pretreatment, upon pH adjustment to 6 with NaOH pearls. 20 FPU of the cellulolytic enzyme cocktail Cellic® CTec2 was loaded for each g of dry matter (DM). To keep the solid:liquid ratio of 10% (w/v) between biomass and hydrolysate, it was removed a portion of hemicellulosic liquid calculated based on the percentage of dry biomass lost after pretreatment due to fibers hydrolyzation. All SSCF experiments were carried out by duplicate at 34 °C, 200 rpm, 1vvm on an initial working volume of 400 ml and pH 6 for 72 h. The SSCF was performed in co-culture (SSCF P. putida + P. polymyxa). The strains were inoculated at an initial OD of 0.25. Sugar content, growth profile (via plating), and production profile of 2,3-BDO and other by-products, such as acetoin, ethanol, and lactic acid, were monitored as in SSF. Analytical determinations were carried out in duplicate for HPLC data, and the average results are shown. A brief description of the two scenarios is provided in Figure 1.

Flow charts of the scenario A (simultaneous saccharification and fermentation; SSF) on the left, and of scenario B (simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation; SSCF).  5.2.2 Economic potential (EP) The economic potential (EP) is a valuable tool to determine the feasibility of chemical and biochemical production processes in the early stages of development. At the Input/Output analysis (I/O) level, the EP quantifies the difference between revenues and expenses. This 
 
 153 difference is derived from the sale of the main products and by-products, offset against the costs of raw materials, as well as utilities costs (Dimian et al., 2019) (Eq. (1)).   𝐸𝑃!/#={𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡	𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒}+{𝐵𝑦−𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡	𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒}−{𝑅𝑎𝑤	𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙	𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠}−{𝑈𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠	𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠}     Eq. (1)  The raw materials include BSG, sulfuric acid, inoculum, enzymes, solvent, sodium hydroxide, and nutrients. On the other hand, the Utilities costs are associated with the energy consumption of the plant, in terms of cooling/heating utility services. Certainly, the EPI/O should have a largely positive value to consider the process economically feasible and allow for advancement in the subsequent stages of the process design. In this study, the following scenarios for BSG valorization were considered for the economic analysis: Sc A) SSF strategy: production of 2,3-BDO from solid fraction of BSG after pretreatment; and Sc B) SSCF strategy: production of 2,3-BDO from the solid/liquid slurry of BSG after pretreatment. Additionally, all the scenarios considered the production of electricity from the waste solids (lignin) through combustion in a boiler and subsequent use of the hot gas to generate electricity through a Rankine cycle (Mailaram et al., 2022). The calculation of yields considered the sugars obtained from dilute acid pretreatment of BSG and the chemical composition of BSG, as determined in this study. In addition, the yields for the SSF and SSCF stages were considered, according to the experimental data reported in this study. Literature data were used to complete the yield calculation for by-products, raw and auxiliary materials, mainly in the neutralization, digestion (Mailaram et al., 2022) and downstream process (Harvianto et al., 2018). A flow rate of 200 ton/day of dry BSG with 8000 h/y of operating time and geographical location in Spain were considered. The prices used to calculate the EPI/O of the materials involved in the two scenarios are listed in Table 1. The yields, revenues, expenses, and EPI/O for each scenario are shown in results and discussion.  The cost associated with utility consumption, an important aspect that significantly impacts the economy of industrial-scale processes, was also considered (Cabrera Camacho et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Mussatto et al., 2013). The scenarios were modelled selecting the NRTL model to describe the vapor-liquid equilibrium and the Henry´s constant model to describe the gas-liquid behavior associated mainly with the CO2, oxygen, and nitrogen. Physicochemical properties of the non-conventional biomass components were obtained from the NREL databank (Humbird et al., 2011; Wooley and Putsche, 1996), updated for new components inside of Aspen Plus databank when it was possible (Humbird et al., 2011). The  
 154 other components of the BSG biomass were considered as solids represented by the following chemical formulas: lignin as C7.3H13.9O1.3, protein as C2H5NO2 (glycine), ashes as CaO, acetyl groups as CH3COOH (acetic acid), and extractives as C6H12O7 (gluconic acid). Likewise, the cellulase enzyme used was represented by the formula CH1.57N0.29O0.31S0.007, while the bacteria P. putida and P. polymyxa were represented as CH1.64N0.23O0.39S0.0035 according to the generic cell mass reported in the NREL technical reports (Humbird et al., 2011; Wooley and Putsche, 1996).  Aspen Plus v14 was used to simulate the heat exchangers, bioreactors, burners, distillation towers, pumps and compressors, with the aim of obtaining the desired products and the mass and energy balances. With the simulation outcomes it was possible to calculate the economic potential of the proposed scenarios. It was assumed that the processes are stand-alone, but are adjacent to a brewery plant, where the electricity generated can be considered as credit in the process. The same prices of the raw materials are expressed in the Table 2. In addition, the cost of the BSG was considered at 56.15 USD/ton (Mailaram et al., 2022) and its transportation cost were considered zero. A brief description of the two scenarios is provided in Figure 1, and a complete block diagram of each process is given in Figure 2. To evaluate the influence of different factors on EPI/O of each scenario, a sensitivity analysis was carried out, considering an uncertainty of ± 20% in the prices of BSG, oleyl alcohol, electricity as coproduct and others (sulfuric acid, inoculum, enzyme, NaOH, nutrients and ashes treatment). On the other hand, the BDO was considering between 1.6-4.7 USD/kg (chemanalyst.com) and the natural gas price in Spain between 7.44-24.67 USD/GJ (data from: Spain gas price-eurostat), which are the minimum and maximum prices in the last 13 years.

 5.2.3 Description of scenario A The BSG is fed to the diluted acid pretreatment besides a stream of sulfuric acid (1.25% w/v with a S:L ratio of 1:8 w/v), at 155 oC (5.44 bar of pressure) for 17 min. Due to the operating conditions of the pretreatment, the generation of inhibitors was measured, being calculated with the following conversions: 7.5% of cellulose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and 0.8% of xylan/arabinan to furfural.  The product of the pretreatment was submitted to centrifugation, where the solid was separated from the liquid hemicellulosic hydrolysate, rich in inhibitors. The solid was then sent to the SSF stage, with the following operating conditions: 10% (w/w) of solid load, pH 4.8, with 150 rpm at 34 °C for 48 h of reaction time. The enzyme cocktail Cellic® CTec2 (CC2, Novozymes, Denmark) with a load of 20 FPU/g was used. The enzymatic hydrolysis was simultaneously fed with P. polymyxa at 7.6% (v/v) to the total volume of reaction. The reactions of SSF are shown in the Table 3, where the fractional conversion of each compound was calculated to obtain the next concentration in the liquid stream product of the SSF stage: 11.40 g/L of BDO, 1.53 g/L of acetoin and 1.57 of g/L of ethanol.

 156 The liquid stream with 11.40 g/L of BDO was submitted to a liquid-liquid extraction, using oleyl alcohol as solvent (Harvianto et al., 2018). The ratio solvent:feed ratio was 2.62, allowing achieving a 97% of 2,3-BDO recovering from the fermentation broth. The extract was sent to a distillation tower for separation the 2,3-BDO from the solvent, recovering the 99.9% of the product and the solvent, which is recycled to the liquid-liquid extraction unit. The distillate, rich in 2,3-BDO (82%) is sent to a second distillation tower, obtaining 2,3.BDO with 99% of purity, with the residual solvent being recycled to the liquid-liquid extraction unit. On the other hand, the hemicellulosic hydrolysate was neutralized and sent to a digester (Mairalam et al., 2022) to produce methane/CO2 from the C6, C5 sugars and the extractives, at 40 °C. The liquid products from the digester and liquid-liquid extraction, were sent to a wastewater treatment unit (WWT), using reverse osmosis units to separate the organic/inorganic fractions from the water (Mussatto et al., 2013). The water obtained after the treatment was recycled to the pretreatment and SSF stage. Finally, the residual fuel streams obtained from the downstream process and WWT stage, besides the residual solid (rich in lignin) and the methane produced in the digester were submitted to a burner, with the aim to obtain hot gas (1200 °C) that was used inside of a Rankine cycle to produce electricity. 5.2.4 Description of scenario B The block diagram SSCF process shares with SSF the operating conditions for the pretreatment. In SSCF, the solid-liquid fraction generated form the pretreatment is used for simultaneous enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation by P. polymyxa coupled with P. putida inoculum. Before the SSCF stage, the pretreatment product was concentrated removing water to achieve a S:L ratio of 1:10. The concentrated pretreatment product was sent to the SSCF stage, with the following operating conditions: 34 °C for 48 h, using an Cellic® CTec2 (CC2, Novozymes, Denmark) with 20 FPU/g enzyme load, with a 13% (v/v) of the total volume of reaction. The reactions of SSCF are depicted in the Table 4, where the fractional conversion of each compound was calculated to obtain the next concentration in the liquid stream product of the SSCF stage: 20.94 g/L of BDO, 2.18 g/L of acetoin and 0.12 g/L of ethanol. A portion of xylose and arabinose, 19.8 g/L and 14 g/L, respectively, remained unused. After that, the liquid fraction was separated from the solid fraction by centrifugation. The fermentation broth (20.94 g/L of BDO) was sent to a liquid-liquid extraction unit and downstream process, with the same operating conditions described for SSF process. 98.6%  
 157 of BDO recovery is obtained in the liquid-liquid extraction unit, obtaining after two distillations a stream BDO with 99% purity. The raffinate with considerable number of sugars was sent to a digester for producing methane, and the residual liquid was submitted to a WWT, obtaining a clean water that was recycled to the pretreatment stage. In addition, the residual fuel stream produced in the WWT and downstream process, beside the residual solid and methane were sent to a burner to produce a hot gas, that it was used to produce electricity by using a Rankine cycle.

 159 5.2.5 Heat integration via pinch analysis  The efficient utilization of heat energy within the processes (SSF and SSCF) was obtained through pinch analysis for heat energy integration. In this technology, the objective was to design an optimized heat exchanger network (HEN) by minimizing external utility consumption of the plant. In the pinch analysis the supply and target temperature, enthalpy change, mass flow rate of process streams, and the heat duty involved in the unit operations were extracted from the designed flowsheets. In this sense, by using the tool Aspen Energy Analysis, it was possible to stablish the maximum saving in terms of energy and costs of the utilities, considering all heat exchangers in the plant.  Appropriate heating and cooling utilities were chosen to satisfy the energy demand of the plant at the different temperature levels (Cabrera Camacho et al., 2022): cooling water, Tin=25 °C, Tout=45 °C; chilled water, Tin=5 °C, Tout=15 °C; high-high pressure steam (HHPS) T=286 °C; medium pressure steam (MPS), T=184 °C, low pressure steam (LPS), T=160 °C; and electricity.  The prices were calculated using the correlations of (Ulrich and Vasudevan, 2006) considering the average natural gas price in Spain for the last 10 years (https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/gas-prices-non-household-medium-size-consumers-eurostat-data.html). The prices of the utilities are shown in the Table 2. It was chosen a typical minimum temperature approach (ΔTmin) for pinch analysis of 10 °C (Kemp, 2007). With the stream data and ΔTmin, Aspen Energy Analysis calculated the energy and operating costs targets by applying pinch analysis. These costs targets were used as the total costs of the utilities to estimate what would be the Economic Potential (EPI/O) if the plants were totally heat integrated.   5.3 Results and discussion 5.3.1 Chemical composition of BSG and its pretreatment The characterization of the biomass is essential to understand the potential of the raw material to be converted into valuable compounds, such as 2,3-BDO, and to appreciate the efficiency of this conversion. BSG composition was (% w/w dry matter): 16.14 ± 0.1, cellulose; 14.2 ± 0.04, hemicellulose; 21.46 ± 2.12, lignin; 9.19 ± 0.45, extractives; 3.43 ± 0.01, ash; 0.16 ± 0.0, acetyl groups; 10.48 ± 0.93, fat; 5.17 ± 0.18, starch; 19.41 ± 0.13, protein. This chemical composition is in alignment with other studies (Herbst et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2018; Amorim  
 160 et al., 2018). The main component found was lignin, followed by proteins, cellulose, and hemicellulose.  When the raw biomass was subjected to diluted acid pretreatment, the hemicellulosic fraction was fractionated into xylose and arabinose, which were found to be. 16.36 g/L and 7.96 g/L, respectively. Through pretreatment, cellulose was the depolymerized into glucose, releasing in the hydrolysate 8.1 g/L of monomeric sugar. The BSG hydrolysate was used only in the SSCF process (scenario B), where co-cultivation was applied. During a co-cultivation, P. polymyxa and P. putida were coupled to use, respectively, the sugars released during the process and the inhibitory compound generate through pretreatment from fractionation of lignin (Kumar et al., 2020). In the BSG hydrolysate, 2.41g/L of phenolic compounds were quantified. Phenolic compounds have a big potential for many industrial applications (Albuquerque et al., 2021). However, their extraction from the hydrolysate can be costly. In the process proposed, bacterial detoxification is operated from P. putida, which can get rid of these inhibitory compounds at low cost via sustainable bioremediation.   5.3.2 Economic potential of different scenarios before and after heat integration     SSF SSCF SSF** SSF** Revenues (thousand USD/y)            2,3-BDO   6,267.49 18,162.94   6,267.49 18,162.94     Electricity   11,902.80  10,864.87  11,902.80  10,864.87 Total revenues (thousand USD/y) 18,170.3  29,027.81   18,170 29,028  Total expenses of raw materials (thousand USD/y) 7,953.9   10,170.3  7,954  10,170 Total utilities (thousand USD/y 26,676.18 43,615.59    11,553  16,005 Operating costs* (thousand USD/y) 34,630.06 53,785.88  19,507  26,176  EPI/O (thousand USD/y) -16459,77  -24758.06  -1,337  2852  *Operating costs = Total expenses + Total utilities **AFTER heat energy integration   Table 5. Economic Potential (EPI/O) of the analyzed scenarios before and after heat energy integration  Together with 2-3 BDO production, electricity generation was considered to support the global economics of the scenarios, A and B. In the Table 5 is presented a summary of the total revenues, total expenses from raw material and utilities, operating costs, and the economic  
 161 potential (EPI/O) as economic indicator of profitability of the two scenarios before and after heat integration. In supplementary materials, Table 2s shows the detailed costs of utilities.  Before heat integration, the considered scenarios showed a negative EPI/O, indicating no-profitability of the industrial production of 2,3-BDO and electricity at this level of analysis, using pretreated BSG and the downstream processes explained in this study. The main reason for this was the high energy costs of the utilities, being 147% and 150% higher than the total revenues of each scenario, SSF and SSCF, respectively. These costs can be explained by the high natural gas average price in Spain, which was considered taking in account also inflation of 2023. Energy cost impacts on the heating utilities in both scenarios, being low pressure steam (LPS), medium pressure steam (MPS) and high-high pressure steam (HHPS), the main players in SSF, and low pressure steam (LPS) and high-high pressure steam (HHPS) in SSCF (Figure 3). Looking at these utilities costs, it was possible to identify the most intensive energy consumption stages of the scenarios, which was the distillation to separate the product (BDO) from the solvent in both SSF (8,926.10 thousand USD/y) and SSCF (12,553.99 thousand USD/y) (Figure 4). Conventional separation methods of BDO from fermentation broth has prohibitive costs (Kubic Jr & Tan, 2023) due to BDO boiling points of 177°C. In this work solvent extraction with oleyl alcohol has been chosen for its characteristics: a) high immiscibility with aqueous fermentation broth; b) high selectivity for 2,3-BDO; c) density difference with BDO (Harvianto et al., 2022). However, these qualities have favored oleyl alcohol over other traditional separation methods, the energy demand to recover the solvent and obtain a purified BDO (98-99% purity) remains still high.  
 Figure 3. Breakdown of the utility costs for SSF and SSCF scenarios without heat integration. The percentages are calculated based on the total annual utilities cost as thousand USD/y. 
 
 162 In SSCF, the other contribution to utility costs was related to LPS, linked to dryer to adjust the solid:liquid ratio for enzymatic hydrolysis (11,668.29 thousand USD/y) and combustion dryer (6,235.6 thousand USD/y). The adjustment of the ratio between liquid and solid of the slurry obtained after pretreatment requires energy for the water evaporation to guarantee 10% of solid load for efficient enzymatic hydrolysis. Instead, the cost related to the combustion dryer was partially attenuated from the production of electricity, that accounts 10,864.87 thousand USD/y (Table 3). On the other hand, in SSF, the MPS contribution to the costs was given by biomass pretreatment stage, where the reactor must be kept at 155°C to carry out the reaction.  In this study, great relevance is given on the cost of utilities being 77 and 81% of the total operating costs. The total expenses due to raw materials are dominated by solvent and biomass cost, 2,520-4,882 thousand USD/y, and 3,706 thousand USD/y, respectively (Figure 5). One possible strategy to reduce the impact of biomass expenses could be to focus on the increase of total yield of 2,3-BDO to use lower BSG load for the same product formation.  
 163  Figure 4: Bottlenecks in the utilities’ consumption without heat integration. In the two scenarios were identified as utilities with the largest impact on the costs: High-High Pressure Steam (HHPS), Low Pressure Steam (LPS), and Medium Pressure Steam (MPS) in SSF; High-High Pressure Steam (HHPS), and Low-Pressure Steam (LPS) in SSCF. In each utility was highlighted the cost per year of each part requiring the specific pressure steam.   Regarding the revenues, electricity was the main contributor for SSF, while 2,3-BDO was the main revenues-provider of SSCF. This is explained because the lignin, extractives, proteins, the unused residuals of sugars together with the non-saccharified material from cellulose and hemicellulose are burned to produce electricity, being these compounds a large 
 
 164 fraction of the biomass. In SSCF, the utilization of the fermentable sugar was more efficient, therefore a smaller fraction of biomass was sent to wastewater treatment and after the solid separation was burned. Despite this outcome, the net revenue prior heat integration was negative for both scenarios. Comparing the two scenarios, it can be highlighted that scenario B showed better utilization of the sugar sources with higher accumulation of 2,3-BDO (from experimental data) than electricity production. This observation was confirmed also when heat integration was applied to the two processes and the net revenue of SSCF became positive. An EPI/O of 2,852thousand USD/y indicate that the process was evaluated profitable and that the production of 2,3-BDO via SSCF from BSG has a great potential to implemented at the industrial level.  
Figure 5. Costs of raw material expressed as thousand USD/y 5.3.3 Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis was conducted, varying the natural gas price within its upper and lower bounds over the last 13 years in Spain. Additionally, the price of 2,3-BDO was examined from 2021 to 2023. Other factors were adjusted by ±20% from the nominal EPI/O, as illustrated in Figure 6. The figure highlights that the key factors influencing the processes' economic performance are the prices of natural gas and 2,3-BDO, followed by electricity as a coproduct. As anticipated, the sensitivity of the EPI/O, to natural gas prices is significant for both processes, 
 
 165 with a greater impact on the SSCF process due to its higher utility requirements, making it more costly: 16,005 thousand USD/y vs 11,553 thousand USD/y for the SSF process after heat integration. According to the correlations used to calculate the utility prices (Ulrich and Vasudevan, 2006), the natural gas is the primary energy source, consequently the utility prices are function of this variant (see Table 2). The SSCF process can withstand higher nominal natural gas prices and demonstrates a positive EPI/O (9,097 thousand USD/y). However, with the highest natural gas prices, the EPI/O plummets to -11,413 thousand USD/y. In contrast, the SSF process, despite its nominal negative EPI/O -11,504 thousand USD/y, can achieve a positive EPI/O of 3,103 thousand USD/y at the lowest natural gas price.  On the other hand, the price of 2,3-BDO significantly influences EPI/O, with the scenario B being more sensitive due to its higher BDO yield: 3.55 kg BDO/kg dry BSG compared to 1.225 kg BDO/kg dry BSG for the SSF scenario. The EPI/O for the SSCF process fluctuates between -6,145 and 11,118 thousand USD/y. This scenario can tolerate lower BDO prices than the nominal, down to 2.72 USD/kg, the point at which EPI/O equals zero. Similarly, the SSF process exhibits a positive EPI/O when the BDO price exceeds 3.92 USD/kg. On the contrary, electricity as a coproduct shows a similar sensitivity for both scenarios due to comparable electricity production: 6,831 kW (SSF) and 6,236 kW (SSCF). The SSCF scenario can sustain a 20% reduction in electricity prices and still have a positive EPI/O (679 thousand USD/y). In contrast, the SSF process requires an electricity price of 0.24 USD/kWh to achieve EPI/O = 0. Finally, Others, Solvent, and BSG have the smallest impact on both processes.   
 166  Figure 6. Sensitivity of the EPI/O of each scenario to natural gas, BDO, electricity (co-product), solvent, BSG and others. Solid bar: positive change. Striped bar: negative change.  5.4 Conclusions and future prospective  This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the economic viability of producing 2,3-butanediol (BDO) and electricity through the utilization of pretreated Brewer’s Spent Grains (BSG) in two distinct processes: Simultaneous Saccharification and Co-Fermentation (SSCF) and Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF). Before heat integration, both scenarios, SSCF and SSF, exhibit negative Economic Potential (EP) indicating a lack of profitability. The primary reason is attributed to high energy costs, primarily driven by the elevated natural gas prices in Spain. The distillation stage for product separation contributes significantly to utility costs, particularly in the solvent extraction process for BDO recovery. An additional confirmation of the substantial impact of natural gas prices on the economic performance of both processes was given by a sensitivity analysis. The SSCF process proves more resilient to higher natural gas prices, showing a positive EP at certain price levels, while the SSF process demonstrates a positive EP at lower natural gas prices. Moreover, also BDO prices significantly influence the SSCF scenario due to its higher BDO yield, while electricity as a coproduct shows comparable sensitivity in both scenarios.  Despite initial challenges, the SSCF scenario demonstrates better utilization of sugar sources, leading to higher BDO accumulation compared to electricity production. Heat integration significantly improves the economic outlook of the SSCF process, resulting in a 
 
 167 positive net revenue. This research provides valuable insights into the economic dynamics of BDO and electricity production from pretreated BSG, offering a foundation for further optimization and scale-up of these processes in the pursuit of sustainable and economically viable bio-based production. In this study, it was not considered the cost of the heat exchanger network (HEN), because the EP does not consider the capital cost of the plant. For this reason, for a future study, it would be advisable a cash flow analysis, considering the capital cost of the plant and of course, the cost of the HEN, calculating the minimum selling price of the BDO.

 6.1 General discussion   The main goal of this thesis was to develop a bacterial consortium for the effective processing of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) to boost the manufacture of bio-based product.  It is anticipated that soon, the lignocellulose biorefineries will be able to satisfy the demand for fuels, chemicals, and other commodities, offering an alternative to the fossil fuel-dependent industry (Singh et al., 2022). Currently, most of the chemical production still depends on petroleum, positioning biomass as a potential replacement (Popp et al., 2021).  A major obstacle in the development of lignocellulosic biorefineries is the effective conversion of its complex structure, consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, into fermentable sugars (Singhvi & Gokhale, 2019). The intrinsic recalcitrance of LBC to microbial and enzymatic breakdown demands the use of pretreatment methods. Overcoming this requires advanced pretreatment processes (Banu et al., 2021). These various pretreatments induce notable changes in the structure of lignocellulosic biomass, such as enhancing surface area, extracting lignin, and decreasing the cellulose crystallinity, as extensively reported in the literature (Liu et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2015; Auxenfans et al., 2017). However, these processes can also generate compounds that are potentially toxic to the microorganisms typically used in fermentation (Wu et al., 2018; Sivagurnathan et al., 2017). Conversely, certain organisms have evolved mechanisms to break down the inhibitory compounds that result from pretreated biomass. These include pathways for degrading phenolic compounds originating from lignin breakdown, furan aldehydes produced by sugar decomposition, and weak organic acids (Adeboye, 2016; Keating et al., 2014; Kim, 2018; Wang et al., 2014) Consequently, the initial phase of this project focused on an extensive literature review to identify microorganisms capable of metabolizing furan aldehydes, phenolic compounds, and weak acids produced following lignocellulose pretreatment. This led to the selection of six bacteria: Pseudomonas alloputida DSM 6125, Rhodococcus sp. DSM 43001, Bacillus coagulans DSM 2314, Corynebacterium glutamicum DSM 20300, Acinetobacter radioresistens DSM 6976, and Burkholderia xenovorans DSM 17367. These bacteria were tested for growth in three varying hemicellulosic hydrolysates, derived from brewer’s spent grain through mild, medium, and severe diluted acid pretreatments (120, 155, and 195 °C), as detailed in Chapter 2. Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) is the main by-product (85% of the total solid residue) in beer production. Despite its high content of sugars is poorly exploited (Mussatto et al., 2006; Mussatto, 2014). The hydrolysates, prepared at different temperatures,  
  180 exhibited varying degrees of toxicity and sugar concentrations. Specifically, the total content of inhibitors was 0.4 g/L for the hydrolysate prepared at 120°C, 1.1 g/L for the one at 155°C, and 4.5 g/L for the hydrolysate processed at 195 °C, as detailed in Table 1 of Chapter 2. Growth analyses revealed P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. as notably resilient to the inhibitory compounds present in the three BSG hydrolysates. Notably, both bacterial strains thrived under all conditions even at elevated concentrations of inhibitors, albeit with varying growth rates. To confirm their metabolic capabilities, these bacteria were grown in minimal mineral media, utilizing various inhibitors as the sole carbon source. The tested inhibitors included furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and syringic acid, each at different concentrations. P. alloputida demonstrated higher tolerance and complete transformation of several compounds (Chapter 2). P. alloputida was subjected to growth in a cocktail of inhibitors to evaluate its growth and metabolic capabilities within a complex medium. This setup aimed to mimic the conditions the bacterium might encounter in a lignocellulose-derived medium, characterized by a mixture of inhibitors that could potentially have a synergistic inhibitory effect on bacterial growth (Hu, et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021). These results provided clear evidence that the two strains were ideal for detoxifying BSG hydrolysate resulting from pretreatment. With this initial achievement, the focus shifted to leveraging the sugar-rich fractions of the biomass. A literature review identified Paenibacillus polymyxa as a suitable candidate for fermentation, given its capacity to utilize both C5 and C6 sugars (Ma et al., 2018; Koutinas et al., 2014). Particularly xylose and arabinose (C5 sugars) are predominant in the hydrolysate composition, representing 60.3% and 30.6% of total sugar content, respectively (Chapter 3).  Additionally, this strain is a natural producer of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) (Ju et al., 2023), a versatile platform chemical with extensive market and broad industrial applications (Zeng & Sabra, 2011; Wang et al., 2014). In this context, the strategy was to efficiently convert sugars derived from BSG into a high-value compound like 2,3-BDO, and to address the hydrolysate's toxicity with co-cultivation approach exploiting the demonstrated detoxification capability of P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp.  Therefore, in Chapter 3, P. polymyxa was paired with either P. alloputida or Rhodococcus sp. to investigate the removal of inhibitory compounds from the fermentation broth and assess the parallel production of 2,3-BDO. Targeted inhibitory compounds for microbial detoxification during co-cultivation included lignin-derived phenolic compounds, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and furfural. The experiments examined various fermentation  
  181 temperatures and initial cell densities to determine the optimal co-cultivation conditions. Three temperatures (30 °C, 34 °C, and 37 °C) were tested, aligning with the known optimal growth temperatures for P. polymyxa (37 °C) and the operational range for P. alloputida and Rhodococcus sp. (28-30°C), as recommended by the DSMZ 2023 guidelines. Data on 2,3-BDO production indicated a temperature-dependent synthesis, with the highest yields at P. polymyxa's optimum temperature. However, production was observed in all the temperatures. A key finding of this chapter was the effective removal of inhibitory compounds by both P. alloputida and Rhodococcus. Notably, co-cultivation with Rhodococcus led to an increased production of 2,3-BDO. However, a higher accumulation of acetoin compared to 2,3-BDO was observed. Previous studies suggest that acetoin production can be induced under oxygen-depleted conditions (Sitaramen et al., 2023; Van Beilen et al., 2014), which is likely in the microplate experimental setups due to oxygen evaporation during fermentation. The most significant enhancement was seen in co-cultures with Rhodococcus compared to monocultures. Nonetheless, subsequent experiments focused on P. alloputida due to its greater growth stability than Rhodococcus, which often formed cell aggregates. The aggregation in Rhodococcus could be linked to carotenoid accumulation (Zheng et al., 2013), leading to increased cell stickiness and aggregate formation. Such behavior can potentially disrupt fermentation stability in co- cultures. Since pyruvate as a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) following glycolysis (Kim et al., 2017), the focus of this thesis shifted towards utilization of a glucose-enriched medium (Chapter 4). This approach aimed to enhance the production of 2,3-BDO by providing an abundant source of the necessary precursor. Diluted acid pretreatment primarily fragments lignin and hemicellulose, leaving cellulose largely intact. Consequently, the fermentation broth predominantly contains C5 sugars. To increase glucose presence in the broth, enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated biomass was performed using three methods: Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF), Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF), and Simultaneous Saccharification and Co-Fermentation (SSCF). In each of these systems, bacteria were cultivated both in P. polymyxa monoculture and in co-culture. However, preliminary experiments were necessary to determine if P. putida and P. polymyxa were competing for sugar sources in co-cultivation, despite P. putida's ability to utilize phenolics for growth. These trials involved coupling P. polymyxa with either a wild-type P. putida or an engineered strain incapable of sugar utilization due to irreversible deletions. The results indicated that co-culturing with the non-competing strain led to over 59%  
  182 conversion of the total available carbon into 2,3-BDO, with minimal by-product formation, even in a highly toxic BSG-derived medium. The management of by-products like organic acids and acetoin is crucial, as they pose significant challenges in fermentation processes. The results underscored the effectiveness of the SSCF approach, especially when combined with microbial detoxification by engineered P. putida, which achieved a 2,3-BDO yield of 20.94 g/L. These findings are a substantial advancement in the development of sustainable bioprocesses for 2,3-BDO production from lignocellulosic biomass. By employing a co-cultivation strategy, this approach effectively addresses the primary challenges associated with biomass pretreatment, highlighting a viable pathway for enhancing the efficiency and feasibility of bio-based production systems.  In the SHF and SSF processes, the performances of monocultures and co-cultures were comparable, likely due to the minimal presence of inhibitory compounds in these systems. This is because SHF and SSF utilize the pretreated solid fraction of biomass, which primarily releases glucose from enzymatic hydrolysis, rather than the hydrolysate that contains the inhibitors. Consequently, the absence of these inhibitory compounds in the fermentation broth eliminates the distinguishing impact that might be observed between monocultures and co-cultures. However, to measure the commercial viability of the fermentation processes, a detailed techno-economic assessment (TEA) is essential at every stage. Accordingly, in the chapter 5 the primary goal was to evaluate the costs and determine the profitability of the two fermentation processes for BDO production from BSG, SSF and SSCF. The analysis focused on calculating the Economic Potential Index (EPI/O), factoring in the values of the main product and by-products, the costs of raw materials, and utilities. Initial findings indicated that both the SSF and SSCF scenarios had negative EPI/O values before heat integration, pointing to a lack of profitability largely due to high utility costs. The significant contributors to these costs were identified within the distillation process for separating 2,3-BDO from the solvent being particularly energy-intensive. A sensitivity analysis suggested that the economic viability of these processes is highly dependent on fluctuating natural gas prices. After implementing heat integration in the SSCF process, the economic analysis revealed a positive net revenue, indicating the economic viability of BDO production using this method. The findings provide valuable insights for the advancement of sustainable and economically feasible biorefinery practices using BSG as a feedstock and co-cultivation strategy.   
  183 6.2 Conclusions  This comprehensive study represents a significant advancement in the field of bio-based product production from lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), introducing several novel aspects that enhance both the technical feasibility and economic viability of the process. At the heart of this research is the development of a specialized bacterial consortium designed to effectively process LCB, a unique approach that particularly focuses on leveraging the capabilities of specific microorganisms for remediate from fermentation broth toxicity.  A key innovation in this work is the implementation of a co-cultivation strategy, utilizing Pseudomonas putida and Rhodococcus sp., to detoxify brewer’s spent grain (BSG) hydrolysate. This method addresses the significant challenge of toxicity in fermentation, common in processing LCB. Further novelty is seen in the study's focus on efficiently converting sugars derived from BSG into 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) using Paenibacillus polymyxa without supplementation on any nitrogen source. This aspect of the research not only demonstrates the feasibility of producing a high-value chemical from brewery by-products but also contributes to waste valorization. The comparative analysis of different saccharification and fermentation methods, including simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF), and separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), adds dimension to the study. This comparison provides a comprehensive understanding of the efficiency and economic viability of these methods in BDO production. Conducting a thorough techno-economic assessment, which includes calculating the Economic Potential Index (EPI/O), marks a significant contribution to understanding the commercial feasibility of these bioprocesses. Additionally, this study delves into the impact of heat integration on the economic outlook of these processes, especially for SSCF, showcasing an innovative approach in bio-process optimization. The final goal of this thesis was achieved through a progressive series of steps, starting with the selection of key microbes for the consortium and culminating in the establishment of a biomanufacturing process.      
  184 6.3 Future prospective   Future research should prioritize a comprehensive analysis of microbial interactions, especially the communication between P. putida and P. polymyxa. Understanding these dynamics is vital for optimizing the fermentation process, as cell-cell communication in microbial consortia can significantly alter fermentation outcomes. The techno-economic assessment highlighted the substantial impact of biomass price and energy costs, driven by utility demands. An opportunity to boost the economic potential of the simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation process for 2,3-BDO production could be exploring alternative, more cost-effective biomass sources than BSG. Addressing economic and technical challenges will require process optimization and finding solutions to critical steps like water evaporation for adjusting the liquid-to-solid ratio for optimal enzymatic hydrolysis. Two possible solutions are: 1) the use of more efficient enzymes resistant to substrate-dose inhibition, and 2) modifying pretreatment conditions to achieve the desired ratio post-process. Further efforts should focus on enhancing the natural abilities of the strains, whether it's P. putida's capacity to degrade inhibitors or P. polymyxa's improved co-utilization of C5-C6 sugars. Advancing these aspects can significantly contribute to the efficiency and viability of the bioprocess for producing 2,3-BDO from renewable resources.
