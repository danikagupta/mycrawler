ABSTRACT  The scarcity of water due to economic and populatio n growth is considered as a huge challenge for the human kind. 
Therefore water treatment technologies are required  for the sustainable future. The available reverse osmosis system 
has not enough to solve the problem as this process  uses lots of ground water in water treatment. Ther efore, the 
current need of our society is to get an alternate way which is environmentally secure, recyclable and  reusable, cost-
effective and also have the capability to solve the  potential problems of our society. For this purpos e, adsorption is 
known to be one of the best techniques applied for the wastewater treatment because it is cost-effecti ve, economical 
and eco-friendly. Most of the sorbents such as agri cultural waste materials are used for the removal o f heavy metals 
from wastewater. These materials are abundant in na ture, environment friendly, reusable and low in cos t. This article 
focuses on reviewing the recent progress in the app lication of various agricultural waste materials fo r the wastewater 
treatment. The literature survey here is concentrat ed on the outcomes of the various agricultural wast e materials which 
have been actively used in recent years such as- pa paya seed, egg shell, coconut leaf powder, rice hus k and rice straw, 
potato peels, orange peels, saw dust and maize cob and husk etc.

1. Introduction 
In recent years the quality of water degraded 
continuously because of population burst, anthropog enic 
activities, rapid urbanization and industrializatio n and 
excessive use of natural water resources. The incre asing 
awareness regarding the importance of natural water  
resources has pushed the researchers towards the 
development of robust, economically feasible and 
environment friendly technique which capable enough  to 
eliminate the pollutants from water and also to saf eguard the 
health of affected population (Renge et al.,  2012). There are 
various treatment technologies available with diffe rent 
degree of success to control and minimize water pol lution. 
Various shortcomings are related with technologies such as 
high operational and maintenance costs, generation of toxic 
byproducts and complicated procedure involved in th e 
treatment of water. Therefore, comparatively adsorp tion 
process is a better alternative for waste water tre atment 
because of its convenience, easily operational and of simple 
design in wastewater treatment plants adsorption pr ocesses 
are applied for the removal of dissolved pollutants  which 
remain after chemical oxidation treatments. The mos t 
commonly used adsorbents are the activated carbon b ased 
adsorbents. These are commonly used for the removal  of 
organic compounds and heavy metals from wastewater.  But 
this is costly process. Hence, low-cost adsorbents are have 
been used and categorized into following groups suc h as- agricultural waste, household waste, industrial by products, 
sludge, sea materials, soil and ore materials and n ovel low-
cost adsorbents (Bhatnagar et al.,  2015). Low-cost adsorbents 
are known for their ability to remove various types  of 
pollutants from wastewater. Hence, switching from a ctivated 
carbon adsorbents to low-cost adsorbents such as by  products 
generated from agricultural activity and industry a re cost-
effective and also solve the problem of disposal of  the 
agricultural waste i.e. rice husk, petroleum waste,  scrap tires, 
etc. All these are utilized to reduce the pollution  of 
wastewater (Ali et al.,  2012). 
Over the last few decades, the low-cost adsorbents had 
been used to treat water and wastewater. Thus, the aim of the 
study is to review the current literature based on the 
application of low-cost adsorbents used for the tre atment of 
wastewater (Ungureanu et al.,  2015).  
The discussion includes the affinity of adsorbents in 
removing various types of pollutants, natural effec t, cost-
effective, ad its usability after cleaning process.  
This article is structured as the information regar ding 
adsorption processes which is reported in section 2 , the low-
cost agriculture based adsorbents and their capacit ies of 
pollutant removal from wastewater are mentioned in section 
3, table 1. Section 4 and 5 includes the further di scussion and 
conclusion respectively.  492  Treating wastewater through adsorption process by u sing agricultural waste :  A review  
2. Adsorption Mechanism 
Adsorption is the most profitable process and more 
efficient than the conventional methods. This proce ss is one 
of the greatest technologies applied for the wastew ater 
treatment because it is an effective, economical an d eco-
friendly treatment technique. Adsorption is mainly a mass 
transfer way by which the metal ions are transferre d from the 
water to the surface of sorbents, and attached with  the 
physical or chemical interactions. The substances w hich are 
adsorbed known as the adsorbate and the material on  the 
surface of which they attach is known as adsorbent.   The 
functional groups attached with adsorbents play an important 
role in determining the effectiveness, capacity, an d 
reusability of these adsorbents (Yagub et al.,  2014). 
Generally, adsorption involves interaction between pollutants 
and adsorbents in the following steps such as- 
1. Attaching of the metal ion from the water to the su rface 
of the adsorbent. 
2. Transfer of the metal ion by pore diffusion from ou ter 
surface of adsorbent to the inner surface of porous  
structure based adsorbents. 
3. Adsorption of heavy metal ions onto the active site s of 
the adsorbent.  
4. The rate of adsorption is determined by either film  
formation or intra particle diffusion. 
If the interaction between the adsorbents and the 
adsorbed metal ions is of physical nature, the proc ess is 
known as physisorption. The Vander Waals weak force s are 
involved among them and the process is reversible a nd occur 
at critical temperature of the adsorbed substance. Whereas, if 
the adsorbates are attached on the adsorbents surfa ce with 
chemical bonding, the adsorption process is known a s 
chemisorption. This process is irreversible in natu re because 
adsorbates chemisorbed on adsorbents are hard enoug h to 
remove from the surface of the adsorbents because o f 
stronger forces at stake. Both the processes can oc cur 
simultaneously or alternatively, in favorable envir onment. 
Physical adsorption process is exothermic in nature  because 
it is accompanied by a decrease in free energy and entropy of 
the adsorption system. In a solid–liquid adsorption  system, 
the solutes have been removed from the solution by the 
accumulation of solutes at solid surface. The remai ning 
solute in the solution attains a dynamic equilibriu m with that 
one which are adsorbed on the solid surface. The am ount of 
adsorbate which has been taken up by an adsorbent a s a 
function of both temperature and concentration of a dsorbate, 
can be determined by an adsorption isotherm accordi ng to the 
general equation:  
 
Where qt  (mg/g) is the amount of adsorbate per unit mass o f 
adsorbent at time t, C0 and Ct (mg/l) is theconcentration of 
adsorbate at initial and after time t, respectively , V is the 
volume of the solution (in liter), and m is the mas s of 
adsorbent (g) (Coonery, 1999). For the removal of a  wide 
range of contaminants from industrial and municipal  waste 
waters, landfill leachate and contaminated groundwa ter, the 
most effective media i.e. activated carbon is widel y used. 
Carbon is being used to treat Different contaminant s and 
maintain the total flow. It is better utilized for the removal of 
specific contaminants. The activated carbon is prod uced from various natural raw materials so, it inhibits diffe rent 
properties. Apart from the raw material, the coal c an also be 
used as activated carbon source by employing the pa rticular 
activation process of physical nature. The process is 
completed by contact of coal with a high temperatur e steam 
flow (800– 1000 °C). Activation process can be done  by 
chemically too with the use of acids.On the basis o f bulk 
density, several activated carbon classes can be id entified 
such as, the macroporous carbon, mesoporous carbon and the 
microporous carbon. The bulk densities of macroporo us 
carbons, mesoporous carbons and the microporous car bons 
are more than 1 cm 3/g (pore space volume for gram of 
carbon), in the range 0.85–1.0 cm 3/g and less than 0.85 cm 3 
/g. For the removal of large contaminants, macropor ous and 
mesoporous carbons are used whereas for the removal  of 
small contaminants microporous carbons are more sui table 
(Tchobanoglous et al.,  2003).The content of ash, raw 
material used, number of regeneration cycles, speci fic 
surface area and the Iodine number defines the effi cient 
properties of activated carbons. For activated carb ons, the 
content of ash is less than 15%.  Basically, ash co ntent value 
increases with the number of regeneration cycles, b y the 
percentage value of 0.5% to 1.0% after each cycle. This 
imposes limitation on the number of possible regene rations. 
Adsorption capacities increase with the increase of  an 
important parameter i.e. specific surface area and expressed 
in m 2 /g. For activated carbons, the specific surface ar ea lies 
in the range of 500 to 1500 m 2 /g.The Iodine number defines 
the ability of the adsorbent to adsorb small contam inants, 
represents as mg of iodine adsorbed per gram of car bon. The 
Iodine number for activated carbon is lies in the r ange of 
500–1200 mg/g Bonomo, 2008.  
3. Low-Cost Adsorbents 
Most adsorbents applied for the removal of heavy 
metals from wastewater are derived from either modi fied 
natural polymers or agricultural waste materials. T hese 
materials are abundant, environmentally friendly, r eusable 
and of low in cost.

(Iqbal et al.,  2009), Mosambi peel (Saha et al.,  2013), pine 
sawdust (Akmil-Basar et al.,  2005), lentil-shell powder 
(Aydın et al.,  2008), pongam seed shell (Thinakaran et al.,  
2008), musk-melon peel (Huang et al.,  2013), groundnut-
shell (Malik et al.,  2007), olive stone powder (Fiol et al.,  
2006), plum waste material(Juang et al.,  2002), pomegranate

(Khoramzadeh et al.,  2013), walnut-shell (Aygun et al.,  
2003), banana peel (Annadurai et al.,  2002), cane pith (Juang 
et al.,  2001), coir pith (Namasivayam et al.,  2001), yellow  
 493  Sharda Pandey et al . 
passion fruit (Pavan et al.,  2008), orange peel (Liang et al.,  
2011), rice husk (Ding et al.,  2014), sawdust carbon (Malik, 
2003), soy-meal residue (Arami et al.,  2006), sunflower stem 
(Sun and Xu, 1997), ash (Chou et al.,  2001), white rice-husk 
(Tavlieva e al. 2013), wood based biochar material (Kizito et 
al.,  2015), sky fruit husk (Njoku et al.,  2014), pomegranate 
peel (Bhatnagar et al.,  2010), biomass material (Euphorbia 
rigida) (Gercel et al.,  2008), pine-wood powder (Tseng et al.,  
2003), almond shells powder (Doulati Ardejani et al.,  2008), 
ash gourd peel (Sreenivas et al.,  2014), cucumis-sativa peel 
(Pandey et al.,  2014), lentil husk (Basu et al.,  2015), neem 
tree bark (Maheshwari et al.,  2015), sunflower pod (Witek-
Krowiak, 2012), wheat stalk (Tan et al.,  2009), carbon based 
cloth materail (Ayranci and Hoda, 2004), cassava pe el 
(Owamah, 2014), and coconut-shells (Pillai et al.,  2014) have 
been actively used for the removal of various dyes from 
aqueous solutions. The main functional group compon ents of 
the agricultural waste materials include hemicellul oses, 
lignin, lipids, proteins, simple sugars, water, hyd rocarbons 
and starch, having a potential sorption capacity fo r various 
pollutants (Bhatnagar et al.,  2010). Agricultural waste 
products are used in both the way natural and modif ied. In 
the natural form, the product is washed, made fine paste until 
it attains the desired particle size and after that  used it as 
adsorbents in adsorption process for the treatment of 
wastewater. Whereas, in the modification of agricul tural 
waste, the agricultural waste is pre-treated by mod ification 
techniques (Bhatnagar et al.,  2010). This modification of 
agricultural waste enhances the functional group ca pacity of 
cleaning and also increases the number of active si tes on the 
surface of adsorbents. Agricultural waste materials  have been 
widely tested for the adsorption process for the re moval of 
pollutants from the aqueous solution. The most sign ificant 
examples are mentioned here in which agricultural w aste 
materials are used as sorbents for the removal of d yes from 
aqueous solution. Aygun et al.,  2003, used almond shell, 
hazelnut-shell, walnut-shell and apricot stone as r aw 
materials and modified agricultural waste as granul ar 
activated carbon (GAC). GACs are known for their ph ysical 
properties such as attrition, bulk density, etc. ch emical 
properties such as elemental composition, % weight loss, 
etc., morphological properties such as surface area , surface 
chemistry, etc., and adsorption properties such as iodine 
number, phenol and methylene blue adsorption.GAC 
formation is independent of elemental composition b ut 
depends on type of formation. With pyrolysis temper ature 
and activation time with ZnCl 2, the adsorption capacity of 
prepared GACs have been increased which shows the 
following order of raw materials usability for the methylene 
blue adsorption especially for the GACs formed from  
hazelnut and walnut-shells as- hazelnut-shell > wal nut-shell 
~ apricot stone > almond-shell. Juang et al.,  2002, prepared 
the activated carbon sample from bagasses by steami ng the 
carbons at different extents of burn off by varying  the 
temperature in the range of 750–840 °C. The prepare d 
carbons then ground in a mill to make a fine paste after that 
washed and dried it. This will increase the volume fraction of 
mesopores and micropores from 22.3 to 31.1% with 
increasing the extent of burn-off from 80.6 to 91.3  wt%. The 
iodine number of the prepared carbons, as well as t he 
adsorption capacities have also increased. The adso rption 
capacity has tested for the removal of two commerci al dyes 
Acid blue 25(AB 25) and Basic red 22(BR 22) from wa ter 
which resulted increase with the increase in the ex tent of burn-off. Thinkaran et al.,  2008, used gingelly (sesame) (S), 
cotton (C) and pongam (P) seed shells and prepared activated 
carbons and used the prepared sample for the remova l of 
Acid Red 114 (AR 114) from water. The synthesis of 
activated carbons from raw materials involves the r epeatedly 
washing of raw materials with distilled water to re move dust 
and other impurities, followed by drying of raw mat erials in 
the sunlight for 48 hrs, after that cutting of thes e into small 
pieces and soaked in sulphuric acid (1:2, W/V) and heating 
the sample for 24 hrs at 80 0C in a muffle furnace. After the 
chemical treatment all the samples of different raw  materials 
have holed to room temperature and washed several t imes 
until the pH gets neutral. The washed samples then dried in 
hot air oven at 105 0C. After this process prepare a fine 
power. W the treated powder samples of activated ca rbons 
have used for the removal of AR114. The results sho wed the 
higher removal percentages at lower concentration o f AR114 
~ 3g/L. The removal efficiencies of the adsorbents ar e in the 
order of S < C < P. Akmil-Ba şar et al.,  2005, studied the 
removal of malachite green (MG) dye from aqueous 
solutions using two different adsorbents (CZn5, PET Na8), 
prepared from pine sawdust and polyethyleneterephat alate 
(PET) by chemical activation with ZnCl 2 and NaOH, 
respectively. The study has based on dye concentrat ion, pH 
and contact time to test the adsorption capacity of  adsorbents. 
Both adsorbents CZN5 and PETNa8 have effectively 
removed the dye at higher concentration, at favorab le pH 
range 6-10 with equilibrium times as 120 min and 90  min 
respectively, having order of adsorption capacities  are as 
CZn5 > PETNa8.Malik et al.,  2007, used ground-nutshell for 
the preparation of an adsorbent by chemical activat ion using 
ZnCl 2 under optimized conditions. The comparative study 
has also been done between the characteristics of n ovel 
activated carbon and commercially available powdere d 
activated carbon (CPAC). The surface area, iodine a nd 
methylene blue number of novel activated carbon is higher 
than CPAC. The study used both the carbon samples f or the 
removal of MG dye from water by using dye concentra tion 
(100–200 mg/l), adsorbent concentration (0.1–1 g/l)  and 
duration of cleaning (5–120 min). The novel activat ed carbon 
sample showed 94.5% removal of the dye in 30 min fo r the 
adsorbent concentration of 0.5 g/l and dye concentr ation of 
100 mg/l, whereas CPAC showed 96% removal of the dy e in 
15 min for the similar composition of experiment. T seng et 
al.,  2003, studied the Physical properties of activated  carbons 
prepared from pinewood at different activation time s (0.5, 
1.5, 2.7, and 4.0 h) in steam at 900 °C, followed b y grinding 
in a mill and washing with water, drying and sieved  in the 
size range 0.12–0.20 nm. Prepared pinewood-products  have 
been used for the removal of three dyes Acid blue 2 64 (AB 
264), Basic blue 69 (BB 69), Methylene blue (MB) fr om 
aqueous solutions at 30 °C. The adsorption capaciti es of the 
adsorbents are in the order of AB 264 > BB 69 > MB.  
Annadurai et al.,  2002, used banana and orange peels as 
adsorbents to study the removal of dyes such as met hyl 
orange (MO), methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RB),  
Congo red (CR), methyl violet (MV), amido black 10B  (AB). 
The peels are dried, grinded, and washed thoroughly  with 
deionized water to remove dirt and dust, followed b y drying 
in an air oven at 100–120 °C for 24 h. After drying , the 
treated sample is sieved through a 5 mm mesh size. The 
adsorption capacities of the treated samples have d ecreased 
in the order of methyl orange (MO) > methylene blue  (MB) > 
Rhodamine > (RB) > Congo red (CR) > methyl violet ( MV)  494  Treating wastewater through adsorption process by u sing agricultural waste :  A review  
> amido black 10B (AB) in the removal process of dy es. 
Pavan et al.,  2008, used yellow passion fruit (YPFW), a 
powdered solid waste, as bio-sorbent for the remova l of 
Methylene blue (MB). The powdered solid waste is wa shed 
several times with distilled water and dried in the  sunlight for 
48 h. after grind the final material and sieved wit h the 
particle size less than 250 µm and subsequently washed the 
powder with doubly distilled water for 10 min and d ried in an 
oven at 60 °C temperature for 24 hours. Now prepare d 
powdered material has preserved in the desiccator f or further 
use in the adsorption studies. The adsorption effic iency has 
test of the prepared powder sample in the removal o f MB dye 
at room temperature. The adsorption of MB dye is fa vorable 
in the basic pH range for 48 hrs of contact time an d is 44.67 
mg/g. Malik, 2003, used mahogany sawdust and rice h usk 
and prepared activated carbons and studied it as ad sorbents 
for the removal of Acid Yellow 36 [AY 36]. The adso rption 
capacities of both the activated carbons prepared f rom 
sawdust and rice husk are 183.8 mg/g and 86.9 mg/g for the 
pH value of 3, respectively. Arami et al.,  2006, used soy 
meal hull (SMH) for the removal of four textile dye s, Direct 
red 80 (DR80), Direct red 81 (DR81), Acid blue 92 ( AB92) 
and Acid red 14 (AR14) from an aqueous solution. Th e 
adsorption is favorable for the pH value of 2 and a dsorption 
capacities of SMH for the for dyes removal are 178. 57, 
120.48, 114.94 and 109.89 mg/g of adsorbent, respec tively. 
Hence, based on results, author concluded that SMH is a 
natural, eco-friendly and low-cost adsorbent with r elatively 
large adsorption capacity suitable for the removal of dyes 
from aqueous solutions. Ezechi et al.,  2015, used Ageratum 
conyzoides leaf powder, collected in a rural area o f Malaysia, 
to test the adsorption capacity for the removal of MB dye. 
The collected leaves have washed several times with  distilled 
water to remove surface dust particles and dried it  in the 
sunlight for 48 hrs, followed by drying in the oven  at 60 °C 
temperature for 24 hours. The dried leaves have bee n grinded 
and sieved to particle size of 75–100 µm. After washing the 
prepared powder by 15 times to remove chlorophyll p igments 
and again dry the prepared sample in the oven at 60  °C for 24 
h stored in a container for further use of adsorpti on study. 
The better results are found at pH value of 4 which  is the 
91% removal of MB dye after 20 min of adsorption pr ocess 
with the initial concentration of 20 mg/l. Gürses et al.,  2014, 
used A şkale lignite for the removal of MB dye from aqueous  
solution. In this experiment the waste adsorbent is  not treated 
and also study the effect of temperature, dye conce ntration, 
pH and ionic strength on the adsorption capacity of  the 
Aşkale lignite waste. They fixed the contact time of 20 min, 
adsorbent amount of 0.15 g, temperature f reaction of 20°C, 
neutral pH value and varied the adsorbate concentra tion of 
10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mg/l and analyzed that t he 
adsorption capacity increases with increase of conc entration 
of adsorbate as about 7 mg/g, 13 mg/g, 22.5 mg/g, 2 6 mg/g, 
29 mg/g and 32 mg/g, respectively. Shi et al.,  1999, have 
tested the adsorption capacity of sunflower stalks by 
chemically grafting quaternary ammonium groups on t hem. 
They studied the adsorption capacity of the prepare d samples 
in the removal of Congo red (CR) and direct blues ( DB) dyes 
with the chemically modified and raw sunflower samp les. 
The maximum adsorption capacities are obtained for 
modified sunflower stem powder sample as compared w ith 
the raw ones, which is to be 191 and 216 mg/g for C R and DB respectively.Tavlieva et al.,  2013, used white rice husk 
as adsorbent for the removal of brilliant green (BG ) in 
aqueous solutions. The maximum adsorbent capacity i s found 
to be 85.56 mg/g at the temperature of 47 °C with a  contact 
time of 60 min. when they changed the adsorbate 
concentration of 3, 6, 8, 20, 40 and 100 mg/l  the adsorbent 
capacity changes as about 0.8 mg/g, 0.9 mg/g, 1.0 m g/g, 3.0 
mg/g, 7.0 mg/g and 18 mg/g, respectively with the a dsorbent 
concentration of 5 g/l and contact time of 60 min. They have 
concluded that the increase in temperature is favor able for 
BG adsorption and fast adsorption take place at 47 °C. Ding 
et al.,  2014, studied the removal of Rhodamine-B (RhB) by 
using treated rice husk-based activated carbon. The  process 
of treatment involves the mixing of rice husk with 
phosphoric acid in a mass ratio of rice husk to pho sphoric 
acid of 1:4, followed by heating upto 500 °C for 1 hr. The 
obtained powder is treated with various ways and pr epared 
different samples. In the first way the obtained po wder is just 
washed until to get neutral pH and named as P-AC. T he 
second way is that the obtained powder is washed wi th the 
hot water (95 °C) until to get neutral pH and named  the 
sample as P95-AC.In the third way, the obtained pow der 
sample is washed with the distilled water until to get neutral 
pH and mixed into 3 wt% potassium hydroxide solutio n. The 
mixture is allowed to boil under reflux condition f or 1 hr. 
after filtering the mixture the solid obtained prod uct has 
named as PK-AC. Another treatment of raw rice husk for the 
production of activated carbon has mentioned by aut hor such 
as taking the mixture solution of mass ratios of ri ce husk to 
KOH was 1:4, and carried the reaction at 400 °C for  half an 
hour and then 800 °C for 1 h. Thus, prepared activa ted 
carbon sample is named as K-AC.  Results shows that  PK-
AC is an effective adsorbent for removal of RhB fro m 
aqueous solution and reaction is dependent on the I nitial RhB 
concentration and temperature and less affected fro m pH.  
The use of agriculture waste adsorbent materials fo r the 
removal of heavy metals from single compound aqueou s 
solution are herein described such as Ligno-cellulo sic and 
Agave bagasse materials. Ligno-cellulosic exhibits a very 
complex structure which contains a variety of activ e sites that 
are capable enough for adsorbing contaminants from aqueous 
solutions, whereas, Agave bagasse is a sub-product of 
alcohol industry which has been very little studied , which 
could have the potential to remove a variety of con taminants 
from aqueous solutions.  
Pandey et al.,  2014, have used chemically modified 
cucumis-sativus peels (CSP), treated with HCl in th e removal 
of Cd (II) ions from aqueous solutions. The removal  
efficiency was 84.85% for the initial concentration  of 20 mg/l 
of Cd (II) ion at pH value of 5 and also studied th e adsorption 
isotherms for the metal ion concentrations ranging from 5 to 
150 mg/l. Sreenivas et al.,  2014, used ash gourd peel for the 
removal of chromium (VI) metal ions. Treatment proc ess 
involves the grinding and sieving to get particle s ize (446

Furthermore, Table 1 represents applied agricultura l 
waste based adsorbent material, pollutants removed,  contact 
time along with their adsorption capacities with re ference. 
The adsorption capacity of agricultural materials i ncreases 
with the further modification via heat treatment an d chemical 
treatment in their raw form. However, the informati on 
regarding the agricultural materials is not complet e in all the 
available literatures, some examples are mentioned in table 1 
for their comparative assessment. 
Velazquez-Jimenez et al.,  2013, used raw and modified 
agave bagasse treated with HCl, HNO 3, NaOH, and applied it 
in the removal of Cd(II), Pb(II) and Zn(II) metal i ons from 
water (pH=5). Characterization study emphasized tha t 
carboxyl groups, contained by bagasse material were  the 
important factor for the highest removal of heavy m etal ion. 
Raw bagasse showed adsorption capacity 14 for Cd (I I), 36 
for Pb (II) and 8 for Zn (II). After modification w ith HCl, 
HNO 3 and NaOH the value of adsorption capacity improves  
from 27 to 62%. The regeneration study had also bee n 
performed and highest regeneration was achieved for  raw 
bagasse to nearly 45%. 
Basu et al.,  2015, modified lentil husk with using 
different acidic chemicals treatment and used it in  the 
removal of lead metal ion. Lentil husk showed a pro mising 
adsorbing material having modified hydroxyl and car boxyl 
functional groups, which are majorly responsible fo r the lead 
metal ion removal with higher efficiency. The adsor ption 
capacity of lentil husk was found to be 81.43 mg/g with an 
initial lead metal ion concentration 250 mg/l at pH  value 5 
and 30 0 C temperature.   
Other agricultural waste material rice husk was 
modified via chemical treatment and applied in prec ious 
uptake of gold metal ion from water (Xu et al.,  2015). The 
functional groups of modified form of rice husk sho wed 
excellent adsorption results with highest adsorptio n capacity 
3.25 ± 0.07 mmol/g. Therefore, rice husk modified v ia the 
studied method is a promising low-cost adsorbing ma terial 
for the water treatment as well as extraction of pr ecious metal 
ions. Tasaso. 2014, studied about the role of pomel o peels in 
water treatment. Raw and modified form of pomelo pe el was 
applied in the Cu (II) ion removal. The result show ed highest 
removal efficiency with adsorption capacity of raw and 
modified pomelo peel powder was 19.7 mg/g and 21.1 mg/g 
respectively at pH value 4, 25 0 C temperature and 125 mg/l 
initial concentration of Cu (II) metal ion for the 60 min. of 
contact time in water treatment application. Theref ore, the 
use of low-cost agricultural waste materials are qu ite 
interesting and promising in the removal of various  harmful 
pollutants and uptake of various precious metal ion s from 
aqueous solution of water. Njoku et al.,  2014, used 
chemically treated activated carbon from sky fruit husk 
powder and applied in the removal of bentazon from aqueous solution of water with the maximum outcome of adsor ption 
capacity 166.67 mg/g. Yadav et al.,  2015, studied the 
phosphate removal from aqueous solution of water us ing the 
activated carbon obtained from fruit juice residue and rice 
husk. Adsorption process was analyzed on various 
parameters such as Contact time, adsorbent and poll utant 
dose, pH, temperature. The maximum removal efficien cy 
was achieved with fruit juice residue as 95.85% wit h 
adsorbent concentration 3 g/l at pH value 6 and tem perature 
24.85 0 C. Hence, with the maximum removal outcome the 
fruit juice residue material is potential material for heavy 
metal removal in water treatment studies.  Kizito et al.,  2015, 
studied the adsorption ability of wood and rice hus k biochars 
in the removal of ammonium. The adsorption capaciti es were 
44.64 ± 0.602 mg/g and 39.8 ± 0.54 mg/g for wood an d rice 
husk powder biochars respectively. On the basis of their 
adsorption capacities value both biochars are a pro mising 
material for waste water treatment. 
Finally with tis literature survey we have analyzed  that 
as seen in table 1, the natural raw materials can b e utilized 
with further modification in the functional groups present via 
chemical treatment or heat treatment. Hence, we can  improve 
the desirable physicochemical properties of the agr icultural 
waste based activated carbon materials such as thei r pore- 
size, functional groups, specific surface area etc.  with the 
modification in raw natural material its physical, chemical as 
well as biological characteristics will change. Mos tly 
chemical modification are more popular and used in the 
preparation of activated carbon material (Gautam et al.,  
2014). In this various organic and inorganic acids such as 
hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid etc., basic mater ials such as 
sodium hydroxide, calcium chloride, sodium carbonat e, 
many others and oxidizing reagents such as hydrogen  per 
oxide and many more minerals and various compounds have 
been used to modify the functional group and improv e 
adsorption capacity of raw material.  
4. Outlooks and discussion 
The activated carbon based materials are the most 
popular and efficient adsorbent materials, widely u sed in 
wastewater treatment applications due to its tremen dous 
properties such as wide specific surface area, abil ity to link 
with various compound materials, easy to prepare, s tability 
and reusability (Grassi et al.,  2012). Hence, to overcome the 
cost issues of activated carbon materials low-cost agricultural 
materials are the most suitable and sustainable alt ernative due 
to its nature based availability. Although, various  literatures 
have been reported but our aim is to focus on to ma ximize 
the emphasis on the use of nature based available o rganic 
waste materials obtained from agriculture to replac e the high 
cost commercial activated carbon. Agricultural wast e 
materials are most convincing option due to their a bility to 
remove efficiently many and different contaminants with  
 497  Sharda Pandey et al . 
high rate of adsorption (Grassi et al.,  2012). Thus, taking into 
account a revised literature on agricultural waste materials 
have been shown in Section 3 and table1. Hence, fro m our 
literature study we will be able to answer some imp ortant 
questions such as, does the absorbent has the abili ty to link 
with numerous compounds? If so, then does this link ing 
ability of adsorbent belong to same group of pollut ants or 
others too? 
It is quite interesting to analyze that in what man ner the 
agricultural waste materials such as rice husks, or ange peels, 
garlic peels, banana peels and many others are bein g used as 
adsorbents for the removal of different dye materia ls such as 
acid dyes, basic dyes and many others and heavy met al ions 
too. Therefore, it is quite interesting to analyze the affinity of 
agricultural wastes for dyes and heavy metal ions r emoval 
from water with their high adsorption capacity ment ioned in 
table 1. With the numerous literature study, we hav e 
analyzed that very few studies are based on the spe cific area 
based wastewater treatment whereas, there are huge literature 
available focused on the water treatment from aqueo us 
solution of single compound pollutant. There are nu merous 
literatures available on the use of commercial high  cost 
activated carbons as compared to the use of low-cos t 
activated carbons obtained from agricultural waste materials. 
This real case studies are highlighted in recent li teratures 
(Gupta et al.,  2006, Kyzas and Kostoglou, 2015). Even 
though, the performance of commercial activated car bons are 
much better than agricultural waste materials based  activated 
carbons (Gupta et al.,  2006) in the form of comparison with 
their adsorption capacities, but the promotion of u tility of 
activated carbons from low-cost agricultural waste materials 
have the potential to solve the air pollution issue  as well as 
tackle the forest fire and many more issues related  to the 
environment. By another case study we obtained the results 
that the performance of activated carbons obtained from 
agricultural wastes are similar to the commercially  available 
activated carbons (Arris et al.,  2014). In spite of above, there 
are few concerns too for the sustainability of adso rbent 
materials such as (i) their regeneration, (ii) thei r life span for 
reusability as compared to the commercially availab le 
activated carbon. First point highlights the concer n of 
regeneration cost of adsorbent materials. Noticing the issue, 
Tolba et al.,  2015, prepared nano-silica from rice husk and 
analyzed its adsorption capacity in the methylene b lue, a 
basic dye removal. The results were 99.6% removal o f 
methylene blue dye in 40 min of time. Nano-silica h as 
showed its potential utility in water treatment as it recycled 
easily with normal heat treatment and highly effici ent in its 
four successive batch of water treatment. The adsor bents cost 
is important indicator because it depends on variou s factors 
such as, its availability i.e. nature based or non- natural, 
synthesis, regenerate and reuse, production place. Çifçi and 
Meriç 2015, highlighted that the cost of pumice is nearly 100 
times lower than other commercial activated carbons . 
5. Conclusion 
This literature review study observes some concludi ng 
remarks such as: 
• There is much less data available about the 
characteristics of the novel agricultural waste mat erial 
base activated carbons. Many adsorbents test was 
performed without highlighting the important 
information about the average particle size and spe cific surface area of adsorbent material, dose of adsorbe nt 
material, contact time of adsorption process, pollu tant 
dose etc. Therefore, still much extensive study is 
required to get all the information. 
• There is less information available about adsorbent s 
and pollutants affinity. Therefore, the adsorbents and 
pollutants matrices could be helpful in the 
identification of specific adsorbent material for a  
particular pollutant on the basis of their affinity  to that 
pollutant, for the higher output removal efficiency  in 
water treatment. For example some low-cost activate d 
carbons obtained from agricultural waste materials 
such as orange peels, rice husks and banana peels 
showed higher affinity in case of various pollutant s 
dye, heavy metal ions and other organic- inorganic 
pollutants as compared to the commercially availabl e 
high cost activated carbons 
• This is an era of focusing on green technology. Thi s 
promising role can be better played by novel 
agricultural materials based activated carbons acts  as 
adsorbents in wastewater treatment at their full 
efficiency. Most of the studies in the field of 
wastewater treatment are based on experiments at la b 
level, whereas only few studies particularly focuse d on 
the real area based pollutant detection and their 
treatment. 
• Therefore for further studies we need to focus on t he 
regeneration of this novel low-cost agricultural ba sed 
adsorbing materials and also careful testing should  be 
done on their limit of reusability in water treatme nt 
applications.
