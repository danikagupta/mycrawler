The world is in a cancerous grip of ever increasing pollution of one kind or another, in
which water pollution is the main culprit. Major sources of these hazardous organicwastes are industrial, domestic, hospital, municipal effluents, etc. These wastes representone of the greatest challenges to environmental engineers. Continuous progress in indus-trialization, transportation, and urbanization supported by population growth and defor-estation, is creating a regular pressure on the depleting freshwater resources in the
majority of the world. Various methods of treatment of wastewaters are available, and
used presently are associated with disadvantages. Therefore, there is an urgent need todevelop an alternate method, which can deal with the problem of wastewater treatment,and in an eco-friendly manner. Here, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) enter thescene. AOPs have been defined as “near ambient temperature and pressure water treat-ment processes involving the generation of hydroxyl radicals in sufficient quantity toaffect water purification.” Hydroxyl radical is a powerful, non-selective and green chemi-cal oxidant, which attacks very rapidly most of the organic contaminants, even the recalci-
trant molecules. Photocatalytic oxidation, sonolysis, photo-Fenton processes, catalytic wet
peroxide oxidation, microwave/hydrogen peroxide, supercritical water oxidation, ozonebased processes, X-ray, γ-ray, and electron beam based processes, etc. have already proved
their efficiency at pilot-scale for wastewater treatment. Time is not far off when thesetechnologies or combinations will prove their worth on a large scale also to assist us incombating against ever increasing water pollution on a global scale.

1.1 ENVIRONMENT
Ever increasing and continuous exploitation of natural resources is posing a serious
threat to the environment. The word environment is derived from the French word “envi-
ron”, which means “surrounding.” Our surrounding includes some biotic factors such as
human beings, plants, animals, microbes, etc. and some abiotic factors such as light, air,
water, soil, etc. Therefore, the environment has been defined by World Health
Organization (WHO) as:
The environment is all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to the human host, and all
related behaviors, but excluding those natural environments that cannot reasonably be modified .
As all the living beings are the integrated parts of environment; it is important for all. It sig-
nifies the existence of a permanent relationsh ip between living beings and the environment.
WHO also defined “health” as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Presently, environmental deterioration, or the
ecological crisis is the most serious problem f aced by mankind. Unfortunately, an ignorant
chase for industrial and technological developments has created many environmental issues
like global warming, loss of global diversity, f orests and energy resou rces, depletion of the
ozone layer, acid rain, etc. At present, the condition has worsened to the extent that all living
beings on Earth are now more or less exposed to some kind of pollution, e.g. water, air, soil, etc.
1.2 POLLUTION
The term pollution is derived from the Latin word “polluts”, which means defiled. It
has also been defined as “the release of substances into any environmental medium from

ported by the environment”, or “the introduction of substances or energy into the environ-ment, which is liable to cause hazards to human health, harm to living resources andecological systems, damage to structure, amenity, or interference with legitimate uses ofthe environment.”
Rapid population growth, and corresponding increase in consumption and ultimately
development of large scale technologies exploiting our environment is a result of the
present upsetting state. Some significant types of environmental pollution are air
pollution, soil pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, thermal pollution, radioactivepollution, etc.
1.3 WATER POLLUTION
Since water is basic to life, water contamination issues have been of great importance.
Water is at the center point of life on Earth. It exists as one of the primary components of
the human body (about 70%). Effect of water pollution on environmental and human
health highlights several important water-related issues and there is an urgent need forsome potential answers related to water pollution.
Theslightest change in biological, physical, or chemical properties of water is called
water pollution.
Water pollution can be of two types:
surface water and
ground water
Surface water sources can be further divided into two sources:point sources and non-
point sources. Any discernible, confined, and discrete conveyances from which pollutantsare or may be discharged, are point sources. Nonpoint sources pollution is commonly theadditive result of little amounts of contaminants gathered from a large space, which refers
to diffuse contamination that doesn’t originate from a single distinct supply. When pollu-
tants present on the ground enter the water bodies under earth, then it becomes the causeof ground water pollution.
Although water covers almost three-fourths of the Earth’s surface, even then only
0.002% of the water is available for human consumption. Scarcity of fresh water hasbecome a pressing issue and requires urgent worldwide attention. It has been estimatedthat in 2025, about two billion people will face water scarcity and about half the world’spopulation will be living in highly water stressed areas. Therefore, reutilization of water is
becoming essential as most of areas within the world are facing or likely to face water
stress problems in the near future.
On a global scale, environmental pollution and the scarcity of sufficient clean energy
sources have attracted the attention of scientists to develop an ecofriendly green chemicalapproach for different materials and processes. Wastewaters from diverse industries areimportant issues and are of great concern to the Earth’s ecosystem. These dischargedwastes consist of organic pollutants, which are mostly toxic to various microorganisms,aquatic life, and human beings; and therefore, destroying such harmful properties of2 1. INTRODUCTION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTchemicals is a cause of genuine concern. Various chemicals like azo dyes, herbicides, and
pesticides are actually found in rivers and lakes, and are considered harmful; some ofthese are endocrine disrupting chemicals also.
Textile dyes and other industrial dyestuffs incorporate one of the major groups of
organic pollutants that impose an increasing environmental danger. As almost as 1% /C020%
of the total world production of dyes is lost during the dyeing process and is dischargedin the textile effluents. This effluent is the origin of nonaesthetic pollution and eutrophica-
tion in the environment, which generates toxic byproducts as a result of oxidation, hydro-
lysis, or other chemical reactions taking place in the wastewater phase. Dyes have sometoxic effects and these also hinder the penetration of light in contaminated waters. Theycolor the water sources and damage living organisms by ceasing the reoxygenation abilityof water, arresting sunlight, and therefore, natural growth activity of aquatic life isdisturbed.
The textile industry is the largest consumer of high quality fresh water per kg of treated
material. This wastewater also contains toxic, carcinogenic, and persistent chemicals such as
formaldehyde, azo dyes, dioxins, and heavy metals. Dyes, pesticides, etc. are complex struc-
tures and are naturally degraded under high temperatures, alkaline conditions, ultraviolet(UV) radiation, and other radical initiators, forming toxic by-products, which may be manytimes more toxic to the environment than the parent compound causing perturbations to theaquatic life and food. These are resistant to microbial, chemical, thermal, and photolytic deg-radation as many of them are recalcitrant products. Thus, there is a need of an effective, eco-friendly and economical technique for removing these from wastewaters. Severalconventional methods for treating wastewater from different industries are used to date,
such as photodegradation, adsorption, filtration, coagulation, biological treatments, etc.
However, some of these techniques are not completely effective and/or viable, due to thestability of pollutant molecules; thus, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have beenreported in order to degrade such molecules, to reduce the load of organic pollutants intowastewater. The conventional techniques are not efficient in reducing heavy metals, nitro-gen, phosphorous, etc. and there is no unique method to treat most of the compounds in asingle step. The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the aquatic envi-ronment is also harmful. Sources of the appearance of pollutants in water and soils include
agricultural run-off, hospital effluent, municipal sewage, landfill leaching, etc.
1.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewaters are some of the major types. It
largely comes from human and domestic wastewaters, industrial and animal wastes,groundwater infiltration, etc. The wastewater consists of 99.9% water by weight, and theremaining 0.1% is suspended or dissolved material. Mainly, three types of treatment arecommonly used and these are:
physical processes,
chemical processes, and
biological processes3 1.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTVarious methods used in these processes are given in Fig. 1.1 .
Wastewater treatment, its management and disposal, has been significantly increased in
modern era as it has become a topic of leading interest for human health. Conventional
wastewater treatment methods are classified as physical, chemical, and biological pro-
cesses. The sequential or concurrent use of these processes in a combined manner may
provide an efficient method in removing or degrading pollutants, but restraints related to
efficiency, execution, and cost are still main factors to limit their practical use. Biological
treatments are promising for dairy and agricultural wastewater treatment. Other treatment
methods have some disadvantages like pH limits, range of organic-load alterations,
physico-chemical behavior of effluents, etc.
Wastewater treatment is a process, which is used to convert wastewater into a useful
effluent (with no negligible health and environmental issues), which is then returned back
to the water-cycle or in other words, it can be reused. The physical infrastructure used for
wastewater treatment is called a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Such plants are
classified on the basis of the types of wastewater to be treated.
In an industrialized country, a typical sewage treatment plant is comprised of primary
secondary and tertiary treatments.

FIGURE 1.1 Classification of wastewater treatment processes.4 1. INTRODUCTION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT1.4.1 Primary Treatment
1.4.1.1 Phase Separation
Impurities are converted into a nonaqueous phase at intermediate points in a treatment
sequence to remove solids generated during oxidation or polishing in phase separation.Grease and oil can also be retrieved for fuel or saponification. Dissolved inorganic solidscan be eliminated by methods like ion-exchange, reverse osmosis, distillation, etc.
1.4.1.1.1 SEDIMENTATION
Solids and nonpolar liquids are removed from wastewater by gravity due to differences
in density. Gravity separation of solids in sedimentation tanks is the primary treatment of
sewage. Heavier solids will accumulate at the bottom of quiescent settling basins.
1.4.1.1.2 FILTRATION
Fine solids present in colloidal suspensions can be eliminated by filtering them through
fine physical barriers distinguished from coarser screens or sieves, as particles are smaller
than the openings through which the water is allowed to pass.
1.4.2 Secondary Treatment
1.4.2.1 Oxidation
Oxidation reduces the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of wastewater, thus, the
toxicity of some impurities. In this treatment, some impurities are converted to carbondioxide, water, and bio-solids. Chemical oxidation is also frequently used for disinfection.
1.4.2.1.1 BIOCHEMICAL OXIDATION
Biochemical oxidation of dissolved and colloidal organic compounds, is commonly
used for some agricultural and industrial wastewaters. Biological oxidation preferentiallyremoves organic pollutants useful as a food supply for the treatment ecosystem.
1.4.2.1.2 CHEMICAL OXIDATION
Chemical oxidation generally removes some persistent organic compounds and left
over concentrations after biochemical oxidation. Disinfection by using ozone, chlorine orhypochlorite in chemical oxidation kills bacteria and microbial pathogens.
1.4.2.2 Polishing
Treatments following the oxidation are known as polishing. Sometimes, these treat-
ments are used independently for some industrial wastewaters. After chemical oxidation,chemical reactivity of wastewater can be reduced by chemical reduction or pH adjustment.Then, remaining contaminants will be removed by chemical absorption using activatedcarbon. Filtration by sand (calcium carbonate) or fabric filter is also commonly used formunicipal wastewater treatment.5 1.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT1.4.3 Tertiary Treatment
Tertiary treatment is also a polishing technique used after a traditional sewage treat-
ment sequence. It is generally applied in industrialized countries by micro-filtration or
synthetic membranes. Nitrates can be removed from wastewater by natural processes in
wetlands but also via microbial denitrification. Ozone wastewater treatment with an ozone
generator is also becoming popular; the ozone generator decontaminates the water as
ozone bubbles percolate through the tank, but this treatment is energy intensive. The latest
and very promising treatment technology is the use of aerobic granulation. Agricultural
wastewater treatment for continuous confined animal operations (e.g. milk and egg pro-
duction) may be performed in plants using mechanized treatment units. If sufficient land
is available for ponds, settling basins, and facultative lagoons, then the operational cost is
lower. Leachate treatment plants are used to treat leachate from landfills. Treatment
options include: biological treatment, mechanical treatment by ultrafiltration, treatment
with active carbon filters, and reverse osmosis using disc tube module technology.
It was observed that the majority of these approaches were only useful to transfer pollu-
tants from aqueous to another phase; thus, generating another pollution, which requires
further processing of solid-wastes and regeneration of the adsorbent, which adds more
cost to the process. Some other methods like, microbiological or enzymatic decomposition,
biodegradation, ozonation, and advanced oxidation processes such as Fenton and photo-
Fenton catalytic reactions, H 2O2/UV processes, etc. have also been used for the removal of
various contaminants from wastewaters.
In the last few decades, photocatalytic degradation processes have been widely
employed for the destruction of organic pollutants in wastewater and effluents. Advanced
oxidation processes (AOPs), have been developed as an emerging destruction technology
resulting in the total mineralization of most of the organic contaminants.
1.5 ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES
Environmental pollution and industrialization has drawn our attention for developing
advanced, hygienic and environment friendly purification technology. The most common
purification processes have limitations like use of electricity and/or other energy sources.
Advanced oxidation processes are genuinely efficient for treating various toxic, organic
pollutants and complete destruction of contaminants of emerging concern like, naturally
occurring toxins, pesticides, dyes, and other deleterious contaminants. Different advanced
oxidation processes for the degradation of various recalcitrant compounds have been
reviewed from time to time ( Ameta et al., 2012, 2013; Bethi et al., 2016; Boczkaj and
Fernandes, 2017; Litter et al., 2017; Parsons, 2004; Poyatos et al., 2010; Wang and Xu, 2011 ).
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) refer to a set of oxidative water treatments
that are used to treat toxic effluents at industrial level, hospitals, and wastewater treat-
ment plants. AOPs include UV/O 3,U V / H 2O2, Fenton, photo-Fenton, nonthermal plas-
mas, sonolysis, photocatalysis, radiolysis, supercritical water oxidation processes, etc.
AOPs were first introduced by Glaze et al. (1987) as processes involving hydroxyl radi-
cals in sufficient quantity to affect water pur ification. Its definition, development, and6 1. INTRODUCTION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTvarious methods to generate hydroxyl radical and other reactive oxygen species like
superoxide anion radical, hydrogen perox ide, and singlet oxygen during the process
have also been discussed. However, hydroxyl radical is the most efficient and effective
species in AOPs.
Generally, organic pollutants interact with hydroxyl radical via addition or hydrogen
abstraction pathways, resulting in a carbon-centered radical, which then reacts with molec-
ular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical that undergoes subsequent reactions; thus, generat-
ing a host of oxidation products like ketones, aldehydes, or alcohols. Hydroxyl radicals
can also form a radical cation by abstracting an electron from electron-rich substrates,
which can readily hydrolyze in aqueous media giving an oxidized product. The oxidation
products are often less toxic and more susceptible to bioremediation like CO 2, water, etc.
Generally, its efficiency depends profoundly upon the selected AOP method, physical
and chemical properties of targeting pollutant, and operating conditions. AOPs are less
applied for disinfection as these radicals have a too short half-life (of the order of microse-
conds), which is not sufficient for disinfection due to extremely low concentrations of radi-
cal, but some efforts are being made in this direction. AOPs are low cost to install but
have high operating costs due to the input of chemicals and energy required. To limit the
costs, AOPs are often used as a pre-treatment combined with a biological treatment.
Advanced oxidation can also be used as a quaternary treatment or a polishing step to
eliminate micro-pollutants from wastewater and for the disinfection of water. The combi-
nation of various AOPs is a quite efficient way to enhance removal of pollutants apart
from reducing costs.
Many methods are classified under the broad definition of AOPs, and some of the most
studied processes are given in Table 1.1 . Advanced oxidation usually involves the use of
strong oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) or ozone (O 3), catalysts (iron ions,
electrodes, metal oxides), and irradiation (UV light, solar light, ultrasounds) separately or
in combination under mild conditions (low temperature and pressure). Light driven AOPs
are supposed to be the most attractive method for wastewater treatment due to the abun-
dance of solar light in regions where water scarcity is high, and comparatively low costs
and high efficiencies.
Different commonly used oxidants in different oxidation processes and their electro-
chemical oxidation potentials are summarized in Table 1.2 .

Microwaves 1H2O27 1.5 ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIt is clear from these data that the hydroxyl radical is one of the most active oxidants
next to fluorine. These hydroxyl radicals react with the dissolved contaminants and initiate
a series of oxidation reactions until the are completely mineralized to CO 2,H2O, and inor-
ganic ions.
Advanced oxidation processes are superior to other treatment processes because com-
pounds present in wastewater are degraded rather than concentrated or transferred into
diffused phase, thus, preventing the generation and disposal of secondary waste material.
In AOPs, hydroxyl radical and other active oxidizing species can be generated by differ-
ent methods, and some of such important AOPs forOH generation are presented in
Fig. 1.2 .
Hydroxyl radical is the most reactive oxidizing species used in water treatment, having
oxidation potential between 2.8 V (pH 0) and 1.95 V (pH 14) vs. SCE (saturated calomel
electrode).TABLE 1.2 A Comparison of the Oxidizing Potential of Various Oxidants

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTAdvanced oxidation involves these basic steps ( Fig. 1.3 ).
1.The first step involves the formation of strong oxidants likeOH, HO 2,O22, etc.
2.In the second step, these oxidants react with organic contaminants present in the
wastewater converting them into biodegradable compounds.
3.The last step is the oxidation of these biodegradable intermediates leading to complete
mineralization in water, carbon dioxide, and inorganic salts.
1.6 ADVANTAGES

activated carbon absorption.
They do not create sludge as in the case of physical, chemical, or biological processes.
Their nonselective pathway allows for the treatment of different organics at a time.
They are capital intensive installation, cost is relatively low as their chemistry can be
tailored to have a specific application.
1.7 APPLICATIONS
Any organic contaminant, that is reactive with the hydroxyl radical, can potentially be
treated through advanced oxidation processes. These include petroleum hydrocarbons,
aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene, benzene, xylene, etc.), phenols, chlorinated hydrocarbons
(TCE, PCE, vinyl chloride, etc.), dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, explosives (TNT, RDX,

Some other applications of AOPs are given in Fig. 1.4 .
In view of the global concern about the presence of organic pollutants in waters and the
necessity for the development of some innovative and efficient technologies for water
remediation and purification, the AOPs enter the scene. AOPs constitute important,

will almost replace existing conventional treatment technologies of wastewater treatment.

2.1 INTRODUCTION
With the increasing influence of human acti vities, synthetic organic chemicals such
as pharmaceuticals, personal care produc ts, and products from the nanotechnology
industry have been used and released into the environment ( Houtman, 2010 ). Due to
increased regulations regarding drinking w ater quality and better understanding of the
benefits of ultraviolet (UV) technology in water treatment, a growing number of utili-
ties consider the use of UV disinfection and/or UV-based advanced oxidation processes
(AOP) to degrade and mineralize those potentially harmful and recalcitrant environ-
mental pollutants.
The UV/H 2O2system consists of adding hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) in the presence
of UV light to generate hydroxyl radicals (OH). The main advantage of using UV/
H2O2for water and wastewater systems resides in the fact that UV radiation can work
simultaneously as a disinfectant, by physic ally inactivating microorganisms, and help-
ing in the photolysis of peroxide, breaking i t into the highly reactive hydroxyl radical
species.
2.2 FUNDAMENTALS
The photochemical advanced oxidation process using UV light and hydrogen peroxide
is a quite well established technology for water and wastewater treatment ( Andreozzi
et al., 1999; Comninellis et al., 2008; Legrini et al., 1993; Munter, 2001; Ribeiro et al., 2015 ).

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-810499-6.00002-4 ©2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.This process relies on the production of an effective oxidant, the hydroxyl radical (OH),
through the irradiation of the hydrogen peroxide with ultraviolet radiation, according to
Eq. (2.1) (USEPA, 1998 ).
H2O2/C0/C0/C0!hv2/C15OH (2.1)
The photoinduced decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in pure water is rationalized by
the Haber-Weiss radical chain mechanism (1932), according to which the hydroxyl radicals
originated by the homolytic cleavage of the O aO bond initiate a sequence of reactions
characterized by an initiation step (reaction 2.1), followed by a propagation step given by
reactions ( 2.2) and ( 2.3).

HO/C15
21H2O2-H2O1O21/C15OH (2.3)
It is worth observing that the net reaction of reactions ( 2.2) and ( 2.3) corresponds to the
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and molecular oxygen ( Oppenla ¨nder,
2003). Finally, different termination reactions involve radical-radical recombination (reac-
tions 2.4/C02.6):

/C15OH1HO/C15
2-H2O1O2 (2.5)
HO/C15
21HO/C15
2-H2O21O2 (2.6)
More complex mechanisms explaining H 2O2decomposition are found in the literature
and include species like HO 22;HO 2/C152;and O 2/C152in the chain decomposition mechanism
(Crittenden et al., 1999; Edalatmanesh et al., 2008 ).
The efficiency ofOH radical production depends on the capability of hydrogen perox-
ide to absorb UV radiation, as well as on the physical and chemical characteristics of the
fluid that will be submitted to the oxidation process. The absorption of UV radiation by
H2O2molecules depends on the molar extinction coefficient 2ε,(Beers and Sizer, 1952 ), or
on the UV absorption cross section 2σ(Molina et al., 1977 ); both related to the Beer-
Lambert law, according to Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) (Kaltenegger, 2011; Lide, 2006 /C02007) valid
for H 2O2solution in pure water.

extinction coefficient (L/mol per cm), Cis the H 2O2molar concentration (mol/L), σis the
absorption cross section (cm2/molecule), nis the molecular density (molecules/cm3), and l
is the optical path (cm).
Whatever definition is adopted, it could be concluded by the analysis of the data avail-
able that UV absorption by H 2O2increases as the wavelength decreases. In fact, the UV
radiation absorption by H 2O2in the gas phase and in aqueous solution is significantly14 2. UV-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES

and Ravishankara (1989) , and Cataldo (2014) , depict the variation of the absorption cross
section, and the molar extinction coefficient for H 2O2with UV light wavelength.
It can be easily concluded that the smaller the UV wavelength is, the higher the energy
absorption by the H 2O2is, increasing the potential for hydroxyl radical production. The0.010.101.0010.00100.00

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTmolar absorption coefficient of H 2O2in the range 200 /C0204 nm is about 180 L/mol per cm,
while at 254 nm, it is approximately 19.6 L/mol per cm ( Cataldo, 2014 ), decreasing to
0.88 L/mol per cm close to 300 nm. Therefore, according to Eq. (2.7) , and as remarked by
Oppenla ¨nder (2003) , adequate H 2O2concentrations and sufficient irradiation path length
in the reaction medium must be considered in order to compensate for its poor absorption
in the UV region. This is considerably more critical, when the effluent to be treated
absorbs UV radiation in the same irradiation wavelength, thus intensively competing for
photons with hydrogen peroxide.
Though most UV/H 2O2treatments are carried out in neutral to acidic conditions, it is
worth mentioning that under alkaline conditions, H 2O2deprotonates with the formation
of HO 22according to the equilibrium H 2O2"HO 221H1(pKaB10.4). The hydroperoxide
anion, HO 22, has a significantly higher molar absorption coefficient than H 2O2itself
(240 L/mol per cm at 254 nm) and, as a consequence, efficiently competes for UV photons
and dissociates with the formation of hydroxyl radicals and oxygen anion radicals (O2).
The latter combine with water molecules, giving hydroxyl radicals and hydroxide anions
(Oppenla ¨nder, 2003 ).
Another fundamental concept related to any photoinduced process is the quantum
yield ( φ), a quantitative measure of the overall efficiency of the process. By definition, the
quantum yield corresponds to the number of reactant molecules (or photoproduct mole-
cules formed) per unit time divided by the number of photons absorbed during this
period ( Oppenla ¨nder, 2003 ). According to Eq. (2.1) , the photolysis of 1 mol of hydrogen
peroxide should result in the generation of 2 mols ofOH radicals. However, in water, the
measured quantum yield of H 2O2decomposition [ φ(2H2O2)] at 254 nm, equals 0.5, while
the measured quantum yield of hydroxyl radicals formation [ φ(1OH)] is 0.98; φ(2H2O2)
in water reduces to 0.30 at 313 nm. In the gas phase, experiments indicate φ(2H2O2)51.0
(200 /C0350 nm), φ(1OH)51.58 (248 nm), and φ(1OH)51.22 (193 nm) ( Bolton and Cater,
1994; Legrini et al., 1993; Pehkonen et al., 1998 ).
It is worth mentioning that the calculated energy for the homolytic cleavage of the
central O aO bond is 213 kJ/mol for H 2O2(Lide, 2006 /C02007), which corresponds to a
threshold photon wavelength of 562 nm, as easily determined by the Planck equation.
On the other hand, the absorption of UV radiation by hydrogen peroxide molecules in the
liquid phase begins (i.e., εreaches 1.0 L/mol per cm by definition) at about 310 nm.
Therefore, the excess energy of the hydroxyl radicals equals 173 kJ/mol, a value that is
surmounted by irradiating H 2O2with shorter wavelengths ( ,310 nm).
As a result, hydroxyl radicals formed from H 2O2dissociation in the gas phase at
248 nm and 193 nm have excess translational energy. On the other side, in aqueous solu-
tion, only part of theOH radicals with excess energy can escape the water (solvent) cage
as “free” species; the remainingOH radicals within the cage immediately recombine
(Eq. 2.4 ) and, as a consequence, the quantum yields of hydrogen peroxide decomposition
and hydroxyl radicals formation are lower.
In addition to the UV radiation wavelength, theOH radical production is also affected
by many other factors, including:
type of UV lamp used (low pressure or medium pressure),
UV light transmittance of the quartz sleeve,16 2. UV-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENToptical path length in the reactor medium, and
optical properties of the effluent, such as UV radiation absorption by specific chemicals
or particles.
2.2.1 UV Lamps
The type of UV lamp that should be considered for the development of an effective
oxidation reactor should have a wavelength emission spectrum below 260 nm. This limita-
tion restricts the use of medium pressure UV lamps, which have the wavelength emission
spectrum spans from 200 to 700 nm ( Fig. 2.3 ). Another issue related to the medium
pressure UV lamps is its higher power input.
UV lamps useful for UV/H 2O2treatment processes include the low pressure mercury
vapor lamps and excimer UV-vacuum lamps. The first emits virtually monochromatic
radiation at a wavelength close to 254 nm. Xe 2* excimer sources emit at about 172 nm.
Table 2.1 presents examples of low pressure mercury vapor and excimer UV-vacuum
lamps that can be used for the UV/H 2O2oxidation process. Comparing the characteristics
of the different types of UV radiation sources available, it is evident that the final decision
to choose a particular lamp is not so easy, mainly if this decision is to be taken based on
the costs of low-pressure mercury vapor lamps and excimers, which are more expensive.
That is because the system designer will need to counterbalance the UV lamp potential
forOH radical production, effective UV radiation output, electrical power usage, lamp
life span, and of course, its cost and the costs for the lamp’s accessories. The main accesso-
ries for the adequate operation of a UV lamp for an oxidation process include the electrical
components, such as the ballast, and the quartz sleeve. Since the electrical components are
specific for each UV lamp type, no additional discussion is necessary.

Note: n.s., not specified.2.2.2 Quartz Sleeve
The quartz sleeve is a fundamental component in any UV/H 2O2oxidation reactor,
because it will be used to isolate the electrical components from the water or wastewater
being irradiated.
Considering this, the quartz sleeve transmittance for the specific UV radiation wave-
length is of paramount importance. That is because the finalOH radical production
depends on the amount of the UV radiation transmitted through the quartz sleeve wall,
which depends on the glass purity, sleeve surfaces finishing, and wall thickness. The infor-
mation about the optical properties of quartz sleeves is not always available in scientific
papers focusing on UV/H 2O2oxidation processes, but one specific optical property is
crucial, i.e., the UV radiation transmittance. That is because the UV intensity attenuation
of the quartz sleeve will affect the final UV dose obtained. Table 2.2 presents the transmit-
tances of some quartz sleeves available in the market, obtained at the manufacturers’ inter-
net homepage.
Most of the quartz sleeves available in the market are suitable for operating an UV oxi-
dation process at UV-light wavelength of 254 nm. In contrast, quartz sleeves with higher
UV-radiation transmittances at 172 nm are more limited.

Note: n.s., not specified.19 2.2 FUNDAMENTALS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT2.2.3 Optical Path on the UV Reactor
Another important parameter for the UV/H 2O2oxidation process is the optical path on
the UV reactor, which is the distance that the UV-radiation needs to penetrate in the efflu-
ent in order to effectively react with H 2O2to produceOH radicals.
The Beer-Lambert law, Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) , states that the higher the optical path is, the
higher the attenuation of UV-radiation will be. Attenuation will also certainly depend on
the characteristics of the effluent to be treated.
Rosenfeldt et al. (2006) pointed out that the efficiency of any UV-light based oxidation
process depends on the reactor geometry, and on the characteristics of the effluent being
treated. In any case, an optical path higher than 1 cm is not recommended because above
this value, the UV-light intensity will decrease exponentially. This attenuation can signifi-
cantly increase, depending on the characteristics of the effluent to be treated.
2.2.4 Effluent Optical Properties and Characteristics
The effectiveness of the UV/H 2O2oxidation process relies on the production ofOH
radicals, which are responsible for the oxidation reaction. In this sense, any effluent optical
property that can interfere in the production ofOH radicals, or the presence of any chem-
ical that can scavengeOH radicals should be carefully evaluated.
The optical properties of effluent are much associated with specific constituents con-
tained on it. Dissolved chemicals can significantly affect the effluent transmittance, reduc-
ing theOH radical production; while certain compounds such as natural organic matter
(NOM), organic acids, and some inorganic ions, can reduce the removal efficiency of spe-
cific contaminants ( Gogate and Pandit, 2004; Liao et al., 2001; Stasinakis, 2008; Tokumura
et al., 2016; Zhang and Li, 2014 ).
Measurement of UV-radiation transmittance at specific wavelength, 254 and 172 nm, is
the easiest way to evaluate the effluent absorption capacity. NOM, and various aromatic
compounds, strongly absorb ultraviolet radiation, making the UV-radiation absorption
measurement, a surrogate indicator of such substances ( APHA, AWWA, and WEF, 2012 ).
The treatment of effluents with higher UV-radiation absorbance, which means lower trans-
mittance at these UV-light wavelengths, will be more difficult and cost intensive.
Considering these factors, the design of a photochemical oxidation reactor for an efflu-
ent treatment is not straight forward. In fact, the final reactor design depends not only on
the specific contaminant to be addressed, but also on the characteristics of the matrix in
which it is contained. The characteristics regarding the UV lamp and quartz sleeve that
will be used and the reactor geometry are quite relevant for any successful application.
2.3 KINETICS
The reaction kinetics of the UV/H 2O2oxidation process as it occurs for most of the
chemical oxidation reactions are a function of the reactants involved in the reaction, basi-
cally the chemical that will be oxidized and the oxidant. The expected final products
resulting from the UV/H 2O2oxidation processes are the carbon dioxide, water, and inor-
ganic acids and salts ( Hugu ¨l et al., 2000 ).20 2. UV-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTHydroxyl radicals are the main species responsible for the oxidation process in an UV-
H2O2process.OH radicals are extremely reactive, and nonselective transient oxidant,
which quickly react with most substances present in an effluent ( Deng and Zhao, 2015 ).
Their short lifetimes result in very low steady-state concentrations ([OH] ss) in NOM-
containing water and wastewater ( Oppenla ¨nder, 2003 ). In fact, values of [OH] ssas low as
10216mol/L have been experimentally determined ( Silva et al., 2015 ). Procedures for the
detection and quantification of hydroxyl radicals are very well described ( Ferna ´ndez-
Castro et al., 2015 ).
A detailed description of the main mechanisms involved in the oxidation reaction with
OH radicals can be obtained ( Huang et al., 1993; Legrini et al., 1993; Matileinen and
Sillanpaa, 2010 ). A brief description of the main mechanisms involved according to
Legrini et al. (1993) is presented here.
Hydrogen abstraction
This mechanism refers to a process, in which a hydrogen atom is removed from the
contaminant subjected to the oxidation process, producing an organic radical. In this
process, the removed hydrogen reacts with theOH radical, resulting in a water
molecule.
Hydroxyl (electrophilic) addition
As it suggests, this mechanism refers to the addition of a hydroxyl radical on the
structure of the contaminant. This mechanism is of interest for understanding the
dechlorination of chlorinated phenols, producing chloride ions.
Electron transfer
It refers to the oxidation mechanism, in which theOH radical works as an electron
acceptor and is reduced to the hydroxide anion. This is the basic mechanism involved
in common oxidation reaction.
The attack of hydroxyl radicals on substrate molecules produce carbon-centered organic
radicals that instantaneously react with dissolved oxygen molecules giving peroxyl radi-
cals, through diffusion controlled, irreversible bimolecular reactions ( Oppenla ¨nder, 2003 ).
Aliphatic peroxyl radicals form unstable intermediary tetroxides that decompose through
electrocyclic rearrangements, with the participation of water or not, or via one-electron
shifts ( Oppenla ¨nder, 2003 ), according to the so-called Russell reactions. The final picture is
the formation of a myriad of oxidation products including ketones, alcohols, aldehydes,
molecular oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and aliphatic peroxides. In addition, the degrada-
tion pathway of aromatic compounds byOH radicals is expected to be quite more com-
plex. It is worth mentioning that secondary oxidant species, such as hydroperoxyl radicals
(HO 2/C15) and superoxide anion radicals (O 2/C152), formed during many decomposition reac-
tions, are involved in chain oxidation reactions with remaining substrate and decomposi-
tion product molecules as well.
Moreover,OH radicals and others are scavenged by carbonate and bicarbonate ions
(mainly the first) through electron transfer reactions, giving radical products (HCO 3/C15and
CO 3/C152) according to the following reactions ( Buxton and Elliot, 1986; Liao et al., 2001 ).
CO 3221/C15OH-CO 3/C1521OH2(2.9)
HCO 321/C15OH-CO 3/C1521H2O (2.10)21 2.3 KINETICS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe CO 3/C152species is considered a very selective oxidant. The scavenging by
HCO 32=CO 322decreases with decreasing pH of the water medium, as a consequence of
the equilibrium reactions involving these species. Finally, cyanide and halide ions are also
effectiveOH radicals scavengers, while sulfate, phosphate, and nitrate are of very little
importance. In this case, chloride ions, originate chlorine atoms with the following reac-
tions, which can add to double bonds of carbon compounds, and therefore, generate chlo-
rinated degradation products ( Liao et al., 2001 ).
Cl21/C15OH2HOCl/C152(2.11)
HOCl/C1521H1-Cl/C151H2O (2.12)
Considering the non-selectivity of theOH radical, it is evident that all these mechan-
isms can occur simultaneously during this oxidation process.
From the practical point of view, when the application of the UV/H 2O2oxidation pro-
cess for wastewater treatment focuses on the complete mineralization of target contami-
nants, the expected outcome of the oxidation reaction is the production of carbon dioxide,
water, and inorganic salts as the final products.
2.3.1 UV-H 2O2Oxidation Kinetics
According to classical literature regarding chemical reaction kinetics, a second order
rate law describes the bimolecular oxidation reaction of anOH radical with a substrate
molecule because it depends on the contaminant andOH radical concentrations. Second
order rate constants are usually measured by competition kinetics methods ( Shemer et al.,
2006; Silva et al., 2015 ), and most values for organic molecules kHO,Mlie in the range of
109/C01010L/mol per s ( Oppenla ¨nder, 2003 ).
Considering Eq. (2.1) , it is easy to verify that theOH radical production rate is directly
related to the photolysis of the hydrogen peroxide by the UV radiation. It is possible to
obtain the rates of H 2O2consumption andOH radical production through a set of equa-
tions ( Table 2.3 )(Crittenden et al., 1999; Edalatmanesh et al., 2008 ).
Considering the dissociation of hydrogen peroxide (Reaction 23 in Table 2.3 ), and defin-
ing the total concentration of the main active substances in equilibrium as [ Ctot](Eq. 2.13 ),
it is possible to calculate the concentration of each species, using the H 2O2equilibrium dis-
sociation constant ( Ka),Eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) .

up to pH 9, which means that the use of reactions (3), (9), and (16) is limited for systems,
which operate with higher pH values.
By using all the presented equations and performing a mass balance (molar basis), it is
possible to develop a model for the oxidation process ( Edalatmanesh et al., 2008 ).
Taking the derivatives of Eqs. (2.13), (2.14), and (2.15) by the time, and performing the
mass balance for the species involved, it is possible to obtain the expressions that represent
the variation of the concentration of H 2O2and HO 22.

It is important to note that the adequate modeling of the UV/H 2O2oxidation process
requires a complete set of chemical equations related to the contaminant or contaminant’s
reactions inside the reactor, including the photocatalytic degradation ones, to develop the
reaction’s rates for all the species involved in the UV/H 2O2oxidation process.
A close examination of the work developed by Crittenden et al. (1999) , and
Edalatmanesh et al. (2008) reveals the complexity involved in the use of the proposed
approach for real conditions. That is because in the application of the UV/H 2O2oxidation
for real effluents, most of the necessary information regarding its composition is not avail-
able or the costs involved in obtaining them could be prohibitive. Moreover, the equations
depicted above consider a uniform radiation field inside the photochemical reactor, which
may not be the case for real systems because of the inherent complexities and non-
homogeneities of the reacting medium. In this case, the uncertainty involved will be quite
high, meaning that a simple approach should be applied.
2.4 A SIMPLIFIED MODEL FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The modeling or design of an UV/H 2O2oxidation process for an effluent treatment is
not easily performed using the complete theoretical approach. The main reasons for this are:
Effluent characteristics are quite variable and complex.
The full effluent characterization could be quite expensive.
The mathematical model can become too complex for practical applications, requiring
the use of advanced numerical solutions.
The results obtained with a more simplified model are quite precise, considering all the
uncertainties involved in the process design.25 2.4 A SIMPLIFIED MODEL FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTFor overcoming limitations regarding the use of the comprehensive model, it is possible
to use a model based on the pseudo-first order kinetics. It is possible through some simpli-
fied assumptions, which can give quite reliable results ( Klavarioti et al., 2009; Qiao et al.,
2005; Shu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2003 ).
The basic kinetic equation that is applied for the degradation of a specific organic
contaminant using the UV/H 2O2oxidation, would consider the concentrations of the
contaminant and theOH radical in the systems, which can be represented by Eq. (2.22) ,a
second-order reaction.
rC52 k½C/C138½/C15OH/C138 (2.22)
Considering the complexity related to the determination of theOH radical concen-
tration, which is quite reactive, it is possible to simplify the Eq. (2.22) ,i ft h ec o n c e n t r a -
tion of theOH radical is adopted at a steady state. It is possible, if an excess of H 2O2
is maintained in the system, with an adequa te UV irradiance. With these assumptions,
two different equations can be propos ed for the contaminant degradation, Eqs. (2.23)
and (2.24) .

oxidation, and Iis the UV irradiance applied, expressed in W/m2. The kinetic constant k0
includes theOH radical concentration and the UV light irradiance, while kvonly includes
theOH radical concentration.
For practical purposes, the use of the proposed simplified model will require the devel-
opment of bench-scale or pilot-plant tests for obtaining the degradation kinetic constants,
which will be specific for each type of effluent studied.
Based on the results obtained with the bench-scale or pilot-plant experiments tests, it
will be possible to design the treatment unit. It is worth noting that more precise results
will be obtained with a more detailed evaluation, performing evaluation tests with differ-
ent UV light irradiances and hydrogen peroxide concentrations. Experiments in a batch
reactor are more adequate for bench-scale experiments, while for pilot-plant units, a tubu-
lar reactor is the best reactor configuration, i.e., plug-flow. Pilot-plant tests are necessary
for obtaining the oxidation process design parameters.
Continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR), could be an option for performing the UV/
H2O2oxidation process; however, for large scale treatment units, its intrinsic design char-
acteristics can result in very complex equipment. In addition to this, the CSTR perfor-
mance is inferior compared to tubular or batch reactors.
2.4.1 Fundamental on Reactor Design
The complete theory related to chemical reactors; fundamentals, design, and simulation
can be obtained in classical literature ( Froment et al., 2011; Levenspiel, 1999; Rawlings,
2002; Schmidt, 1988 ).26 2. UV-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTConsidering the fundamental theory related to chemical reactors, a chemical oxidation
reaction using the UV/H 2O2process can be performed in batch, continuous stirred, and
tubular reactors. The main characteristics of each reactor type are presented here.
Batch reactor
It is characterized by the lack of flow through the reactor, while it is in operation. It
means that the composition of the reactor content will change with the time, until the
reaction equilibrium is reached, or the desired reactants conversion is obtained. At this
point, the reactor content is removed, and a new batch can be started.
Continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR)
The CSTR is characterized by the continuous flow of the reactants into and
products out of the reactor, with its content maintained homogenized using a
mechanical stirrer. The ideal CSTR is perfec tly mixed, i.e., composition of the reaction
content is homogeneous, meaning that the reactor spatial retention time should be
enough for obtaining the desired reactants c onversion. Its operation is only stopped, if
necessary.
Tubular reactor
The tubular reactor is also characterized by a continuous flow of reactants and
products. In the ideal tubular plug-flow reactor, there is no axial or back mixing of its
content. The plug-flow reactor can be imagined as a set of batch reactors operating in
series, with the content of each been transferred to the next one. The first reactor
receives the reactant mixture and keeps it for a small period of time for the reaction,
and then its content flows to the next reactor, and so on, until the mixture reaches the
last reactor and then exits as a final product.
Considering ideal reactors, it is possible to simulate their behavior building a simple
mathematical model derived from a mass balance. To help the development of the mass
balance, it is necessary to define all the variables involved in the process and to make a
flow diagram indicating all the flows entering and leaving the reactor. The flow diagrams
used for performing the mass balances in the three different types of reactors are depicted
inFig. 2.5 .
By performing a mass balance for each reactor configuration, it is possible to obtain the
equations that correlate the variation of a specific contaminant with the chemical reaction
rate, and reaction time or retention time.

manufacturers ( Table 2.1 ).

The choice of the reactor type to be used for the UV/H 2O2oxidation process depends
on technical, operational, and economic issues. Batch reactors considering its operational
characteristics are limited for the treatment of small volumes of effluents or for bench-
scale evaluation tests. On the other hand, CSTR and tubular plug-flow reactors are more
suitable for the treatment of large volumes of effluent continuously.
The option between the CSTR and tubular reactors will be based on the complexity of
the UV/H 2O2configuration and the performance of each one. Considering the reactor
complexity, it is evident that the CSTR reactor has a significant disadvantage, because its
performance depends on effective mixing. The occurrence of a hydraulic short-circuit will
reduce the reactor efficiency.
For any UV/H 2O2oxidation reactor configuration, the lamps need to be installed inside
the reactor, which will make the installation of an appropriate mixer in the CSTR reactor
difficult. In addition to this, ideal CSTR reactors present a lower performance in compari-
son to batch and tubular plug-flow reactors. As it can be observed, the plug-flow reactor
performs better than the CSTR (as revealed by Fig. 2.6 ), reaching an effective degradation
of the contaminant much faster and with higher efficiency.29 2.4 A SIMPLIFIED MODEL FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe UV/H 2O2oxidation process should preferably be performed by using the tubular
plug-flow reactor configuration. As an alternative, the designer should use a series of
CSTR reactors to improve the oxidation process performance.
The information presented provides the necessary base for the conception, design, and
performance evaluation of new or existing effluent treatment units.
2.5 UV/H 2O2OXIDATION PROCESS DESIGN
From the engineering point of view, the design of any system used for wastewater treat-
ment requires the development of bench-scale tests for evaluating the potential application
of a specific process and for obtaining the necessary design parameters. The available liter-
ature related to the UV/H 2O2oxidation process deals with the fundamental and potential
applications of the process ( Halmann, 1995; Pearsons, 2004; USEPA, 1998 ), but does not
present a straightforward procedure for the evaluation and design of treatment units,
which is quite relevant for the process engineers.
Considering this limitation, a practical a pproach for the concept, design, and evalua-
tion of effluent treatment units based on the UV/H 2O2oxidation process has been pre-
sented. It is important to note that the proposed approach was based on the
fundamentals of the chemical engineering process and on the practical experience
acquired over the years.
The first step for the development of any en gineering project is to understand the
problem that needs to be managed or solved. After that, it is necessary to identify and
evaluate the possible options for dealing with the problem, in order that the designer
can define the best alternative. This means that the option for using the UV/H 2O20.00.20.40.60.81.0

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENToxidation process will be compared with diff erent treatment technologies, and the deci-
sion about its application should be very well justified and understood. The procedure
for the concept and design of the UV-H 2O2oxidation process is presented in the follow-
ing sections:
2.5.1 Effluent Characteristics
It is evident that effluent matrix characteristics are of paramount relevance in the poten-
tial application of this process for an effluent treatment. This statement can be supported
by studies developed for evaluating the application of the UV/H 2O2oxidation process for
effluent and water treatment ( Antonopoulou et al., 2014; Giannakis et al., 2015; James
et al., 2014; Michel-Kordatou et al., 2015; Mierzwa et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016 ).
It is possible to identify the most relevant effluent constituents that affect performance
of the UV/H 2O2oxidation process, and the need for the effluent pre-treatment. These con-
stituents can be grouped in three main categories, as follows:
Suspended solids
These represents all the effluent constituents that are insoluble and remain in
suspension including sand, clay, and silt particles, as well as particulate NOM. The
presence of these materials significantly affects the effluent optical properties, mainly
the UV radiation transmission. The easiest way to estimate the concentration of
suspended solids in an effluent is to measure its turbidity. Effluents with high turbidity
values are less suitable for treatment by the UV/H 2O2oxidation process.
Dissolved organic carbon
It represents all the organic constituents contained in the effluent, including the
NOM, and the variety of organic compounds used in our homes, industry, and
agriculture. Some specific constituents are surely of interest including a large variety of
chemical compounds, like pharmaceutical products, personal care products, pesticides,
fertilizers, food additives, and others specific chemicals. These constituents can be
measured directly, if they are the target of the treatment process, or by measuring the
concentration of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or by the determination of the
chemical oxygen demand (COD). In any case, the sample that is to be analyzed should
be submitted to a filtration step for removing the suspended solids. It is accepted that
the filtration through a 0.45 μm pore size filter separates the suspended particles from
the dissolved solids.
Dissolved inorganic chemicals
These represent all the inorganic chemicals that can be present in the effluent. Some
of these chemicals can scavenge theOH radical, like bicarbonates and carbonates, and/
or can absorb the UV radiation. The determination of these constituents can be specific
for a constituent of interest or can be used as an indirect method like the measurement
of the color or the total dissolved solids.
Though the presented parameters can significantly affect the performance of the UV/
H2O2oxidation process, the relevant information regarding the effluent characteristic is its31 2.5 UV/H 2O2OXIDATION PROCESS DESIGN
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcapacity to absorb the UV radiation at the wavelength that will be used in the process. For
this reason, the UV transmittance is a quite simple measurement that can be used for eval-
uating the potential application of the UV/H 2O2oxidation process. This is because efflu-
ents with higher UV transmittances will require small doses of UV radiation for
producing theOH radical for effectively oxidizing the contaminant of interest.
Considering what is exposed, Table 2.4 presents the minimal set of parameters that
should be considered for evaluating the potential application of the UV/H 2O2oxidation
process for effluent treatment.
It is worth observing that other effluent quality variables can be monitored to better
characterize the effluent to be submitted to the UV/H 2O2oxidation process, since they can
be used for the design of the pre-treatment units. The choice of the effluent quality vari-
ables to be monitored will be based on the experience of the treatment system designer.
2.5.2 Bench Scale Evaluation Tests
Real world effluents have a complex composition and the design of any treatment sys-
tem requires a preliminary evaluation of the potential use of any specific treatment tech-
nology for obtaining the most relevant design parameters.
Bench-scale tests should be performed using a reactor geometry that can represent, as
close as possible, the reactor, which will be used in full scale treatment unit. That is rele-
vant because most of the process parameters are affected by the reactor geometric charac-
teristics, and if it changes, the process performance will also change. Maybe the most
relevant geometric parameter is the optical path, which is related to the distance that the
UV radiation will need to penetrate in the effluent and hence, the effective production of
OH radicals.TABLE 2.4 Minimal Set of Parameters to be Analyzed for Evaluating the Potential Application of the

Specific organic

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTBased on the Beer-Lambert law, the higher the optical path is, the lower the light trans-
mittance will be through the solution, and this effect is more significant with the increas-
ing concentration and absorption coefficient of the constituents contained in the effluent.
So, optical paths higher than 1 cm (0.01 m) are not recommended.
With the adequate geometric configuration of the bench-scale oxidation reactors, it is
necessary to perform some experiments for obtaining the kinetic degradation constant. For
this purpose, different assays should be performed including the evaluation of pre-
treatment methods.
The procedure for the bench-scale test is straightforward and consists of the following
steps:
1.The reactor UV-lamp is turned on to stabilize the UV-photon flux.
2.The UV-reactor is filled with the effluent to be treated. It is important to use the pre-
treated effluent, assuring that the best optical properties were obtained.
3.Hydrogen peroxide solution is added to obtain the desired concentration. It is
important to homogenize the reactor contents.
4.Periodic samples of the reactor content are taken out to measure the concentration of
the control contaminant. It is important to take a sample just before adding the
hydrogen peroxide solution.
5.The assay is stopped after an adequate period, assuring the oxidation reaction has
completed or stabilized.
6.The reaction constant (kinetic) is obtained by plotting the values of the natural
logarithm of [ C0]/[C] versus the reaction time. If a straight line is obtained, its
inclination is the kinetic reaction rate. Otherwise, the H 2O2, or the UV-radiation dosage
should be increased, and the test repeated.
7.The test (steps 1 /C06) are repeated using different concentrations of H 2O2concentration,
to obtain the best concentration.
8.The test (steps 1 /C04) are repeated using the best H 2O2and a different UV-radiation
dosage, to obtain the UV dose.
The number of assays, as well as the duration of each one will depend on the final
design aims and involved costs. It is recommended to conduct a more detailed evaluation
for the design of treatment units with a high flow output.
If a tubular reactor or CSTR is used, steady state experiments should be performed
using different spatial detention times, which can be done by changing the UV-reactor
feed flow. An example of the graphic that should be obtained after each bench-scale test is
presented in Fig. 2.7 , which is based on the data used to construct Fig. 2.6 . It is important
to note that the results for the batch reactor will be mathematically equivalent to the ones
obtained for the plug-flow reactor, considering that the spatial retention time is equivalent
to the reaction time.
At the end of the bench-scale experiments, the main UV/H 2O2oxidation process para-
meters will be defined like UV light irradiation, H 2O2concentration, and the degradation
kinetic constant. This information will be necessary for the design of a small UV/H 2O2
oxidation treatment facility or a pilot-plant unit.
Regarding the UV light irradiation, it is quite important to specify the effective UV dose
applied on the effluent, which should consider the energy loss on the quartz sleeve and on33 2.5 UV/H 2O2OXIDATION PROCESS DESIGN

plying the total applied UV irradiance by quartz sleeve and effluent transmittances

2.5.3 Pilot-Plant Evaluation Units
A pilot-plant evaluation unit is used to better evaluate any treatment process and iden-
tify relevant issues that can arise during continuous operation. It is important to note that
its design should consider the results obtained during the bench-scale treatment tests.
Additionally, it is necessary to define all the complementary units and components
that will be necessary for an adequate operation. The complementary units include the
pre-treatment unit, chemical dosing systems, and the necessary hydraulic, electric, and
electronic components.
At this point, it is important to develop a process flow sheet of the UV/H 2O2oxidation
treatment unit, and the complementary documents involved in its design, such as the cal-
culation memorial and system description. This is necessary for registering the necessary
information that will be needed for the evaluation of the treatment process and as guide-
lines for the development of the final treatment unit.
It should be emphasized that the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the
UV/H 2O2oxidation reactor need to be compatible with the one of the reactor that will be
used in the final effluent treatment plant, mainly the optical path inside the reactor.
In addition to its importance for obtaining more precise design parameters, the pilot-
plant unit can be maintained operational after the design and construction of the final
treatment unit, in case of any process changes are intended, or for evaluating different
treatment components, such as UV-lamps. It can be also used for training purposes.ln([C0]/[C]) = 0.0025. τ

UV/H 2O2reactor design
Based on the results obtained on the bench-scale UV/H 2O2oxidation tests, and with
the information regarding the treatment unit capacity, effluent characteristics, design, con-
taminant removal efficiency, and the data related to the UV-lamp and quartz sleeve, it is
possible to design the UV/H 2O2oxidation reactor.
After the reactor has been designed, the first step is to calculate the reactor volume by
Eq. (2.42) , which is based on the reactor spatial retention time and the desired contaminant
removal efficiency, using Eqs. (2.31) or (2.32) for the CSTR or Eqs. ( 2.39) or (2.40) for the
plug-flow reactor. The contaminant removal efficiency is given by Eq. (2.43) .

volume ( Eq. 2.42 ).
With the reactor volume, the quartz sleeve diameter, and the irradiation optical path, it
is possible to calculate the total length of an equivalent reactor using Fig. 2.8 as a

Considering the use of a plug-flow reactor, it is important to use a LUV-net /dRratio high-
er or equal to three, but for lower ratios, it is recommended to use a larger number of reac-
tors, which operates in parallel. In this case, the feed flow should be split for calculating
the new LUV-net /dRratio, using the previous equations.
With the main reactor dimensions obtained, it is necessary to evenly distribute the
quartz sleeves over its cross section.36 2. UV-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTOnce the reactor (or reactors), was dimensioned, it is necessary to design the other com-
ponents of the UV/H 2O2oxidation process, such as effluent storage tanks, pre-treatment
unit, chemical dosage units, and post-treatment units, if necessary. The example below
illustrates the procedure for dimensioning an UV/H 2O2oxidation reactor.

therapy. This effluent is pre-treated through a physical-chemical process, but the resid-
ual concentration of the active compound is t wenty times higher than the limit defined
by the Environmental Protection Agency. The engineer responsible for the effluent treat-
ment facility performed some be nch-scale tests using the UV/H 2O2oxidation process in
a batch reactor and obtained the pseudo-first order kinetic degradation constant for the
contaminant ( k058.731022s21), for an effective UV dose of 200 mJ/cm2, optical path
of 1 cm, and H 2O2dose of 10 mg/L. The effluent releva nt characteristics are presented
inTable 2.5 . Based on the presented data, design a continuous plug-flow reactor to
obtain a removal efficiency hi gher than 95%. Estimate the H 2O2consumption consider-
ing the use of a stock solution with an active H 2O2concentration of 37% by weight

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTFor a plug-flow reactor, a LUV-net=dRratio higher than 3 is recommended. Considering
the calculated values, the LUV-net=dRratio is 2.2, which is lower than the recommended
value. However, the design will follow to demonstrate that the reactors characteristics are
not appropriate.
Quartz sleeves distribution inside the reactor:
Fig. 2.9 presents the final arrangement for the quartz sleeves and UV-lamps distribu-
tion, allowing the use of 24 quartz sleeves.
The resulting UV-lamps distribution layout will not provide an effective irradiance of
the effluent, indicating that this design is not adequate ( Fig. 2.9 ). This problem can be
overcome by changing the UV-lamp model to obtain a more adequate LUV-net=dRratio, or
by using more than one reactor.
Example 2: Calculation with a different UV-lamp model:
To overcome the LUV-net=dRratio issue, a longer UV-lamp with a lower UV-output will
be evaluated. The UV-lamp selected is from Philips TUV-T5—927970204099 ( Table 2.1 ).

of the UV-reactor and the new LUV-net=dRratio, which are presented in Table 2.6 . The
resulting UV-lamps and quartz sleeves distribution layout is presented in Fig. 2.10 .

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe resulting reactor configuration seems to be much more suitable for the oxidation
process than the previous one ( Fig. 2.10 ). This is because the distribution of the UV-light
will be more uniform, which will result in a more effective irradiance. It is also important
to note that the total number of lamps in this arrangement is higher than the one previ-
ously calculated. With the new distribution layout, the total number of UV-lamps is 48.
With this configuration, it is necessary to check the reactor performance for the obtained
conditions.

2.6 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
The UV/H 2O2process is used for treatment of wastewater in some specific effluents.
2.6.1 Slaughterhouse Wastewater
Bustillo-Lecompte et al. (2016) evaluated the effect of UV/H 2O2in a continuous photo-
reactor to treat a slaughterhouse effluent. The system operated with a recycle effluent
ratio, which was optimized based on the prediction made by statistical models and results
collected during the design and operation of the treatment unit. The application of AOPs
for effluents like this is particularly interesting because of the high rate of inactivation of
microorganisms without further addition of chemicals in high concentrations (which may
also lead to the formation of harmful by-products).43 2.6 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTBased on the Beer-Lambert law, they developed a model for calculating the volumetric
rate of energy absorption and used a four-factor central composite design with five levels
of process variables and a response surface methodology to maximize the TOC removal
and minimize the residual H 2O2in the effluent. As the result of this optimization, the total
organic carbon removal was 81% and the minimum residual H 2O2was less than 2% with
a flow rate 15 mL/min with 18% recycle ratio.
2.6.2 Oil-Water Emulsion
Mierzwa et al. (2012) evaluated the application of a physical-chemical clarification process
and hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane as a pre-treatment for increasing the efficiency of
aU V / H 2O2unit treating an effluent with high organic load (827 6109 mg/L TOC).
The photochemical reactor was equipped with a 1600 W medium pressure UV lamp.
The TOC removal by UV/H 2O2was around 90%, regardless the pre-treatment method
applied. However, when the pre-treatment processes were applied, the rate of TOC degra-
dation increased, because of the better light transmission in the reactor. The overall time to
reach a 90% removal was cut in half by applying pre-treatment methods that remove color
and turbidity.
2.6.3 Pharmaceuticals
Rosario-Ortiz et al. (2010) studied the use of low pressure UV light and H 2O2for the
oxidation of six pharmaceuticals (meprobamate, carbamazepine, dilantin, atenolol, primi-
done, and trimethoprim) in three wastewater effluents under different UV and H 2O2
dosages. The pharmaceuticals chosen have specific functionalities that make them reactive
to photolysis as well as to oxidation.
The role of the effluent organic matter was evaluated utilizing an empirical model
based on a second order reaction rate constant. Based on this model, the scavenging rates
were estimated. In the case of the UV/H 2O2treatment with 500 mJ/cm2, pharmaceutical
oxidation increased compared to a UV dosage of 300 mJ/cm2with equivalent H 2O2
dosages. For the dosage of 700 mJ/cm2, the photolysis itself (without peroxide) was
enough to break some of the compounds.
Kim et al. (2009) evaluated the effectiveness of UV/H 2O2on the removal of 41 different
types of pharmaceuticals in a real wastewater effluent in Japan. UV itself was not enough
to remove 29 pharmaceuticals, despite the high dosage of 2768 mJ/cm2. The association
with peroxide reduced the UV dose to 923 mJ/cm2and it could remove 39 components
with at least 90% efficiency.
In a similar study, Afonso-Olivares et al. (2016) also evaluated the degradation of
23 pharmaceutical components present in an urban wastewater treatment plant effluent.
Some anti-inflammatory compounds were removed just by photolysis, while caffeine dis-
played resistance to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. UV doses of 2369 mJ/cm2were required
to reduce caffeine and a dose nearly twice as much was needed to reduce its metabolite
(paraxanthine) to one tenth of its initial value. An optimal H 2O2concentration of 20 mg/L
was enough to remove 93% of the components with a spatial retention time of 75 min.44 2. UV-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTWols et al. (2013) evaluated the removal of 40 different types of pharmaceuticals in
water and their degradation, when exposed to low pressure and medium pressure UV
lamps. Results showed that low pressure photolysis could slowly degrade most of the
compounds. The medium pressure lamps could improve the degradation, and the addi-
tion of peroxide helped to degrade most of the compounds that were not degraded before.
Considering that medium pressure lamps consume more energy and the association of UV
lamps and peroxide were equally efficient for both the lamps, they concluded that the low
pressure lamps are an effective alternative, since they consume less energy than the
medium pressure lamps. The UV dosage for 90% degradation (at 10 mg/L H 2O2) was
500 mJ/cm2(medium pressure) and 1000 mJ/cm2(low pressure).
2.6.4 Dyes
Azo dyes are hard to be biodegraded in conventional biological wastewater treatment
processes. A successful approach to treat these contaminants in water is their mineraliza-
tion by AOPs, mainly UV/H 2O2.
Chang et al. (2010) proposed a kinetic model for dye decomposition, which consisted of
varying peroxide concentration, dye concentration, pH and UV irradiation power. They
considered pseudo-steady state for hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl free radicals and calcu-
lated reaction rates in different pathways; thus validating the model with coefficients
found in literature, and using nonlinear regression. The main conclusion of this evaluation
was that with increasing H 2O2concentration or dye concentration, the reaction rate could
be increased, but it can also accelerate the consumption of hydroxyl radicals and hinder
the process, if the concentrations are too high.
2.6.5 Removal of Estrogens
Estrogens are among the micropollutants not removed by conventional wastewater treat-
ment plants. They have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system and interfere in
aquatic environments. AOPs have been successfully tested to remove estrogens from water.
Ce´d a te ta l .( 2 0 1 6 ) proposed a method to evaluate the removal of estrogens by UV photoly-
sis and UV/H 2O2association in a pilot unit in real conditions. Their study focused not only
on the removal of the estrogens but also on the formation of toxic by-products. Their results
show that UV itself is not strong enough to remove estrogens from water, but the association
with peroxide was able to remove up to 80% of initial estrogenic compounds and estrogenic
activity from treated wastewater. The UV dosage of 423 mJ/cm2with 50 mg/L of H 2O2and
520 mJ/cm2with 30 mg/L of H 2O2were enough to achieve the removal. No high estrogenic
or toxic by-products were detected after the UV photolysis or UV/H 2O2process.
Advances in chemical water and wastewater treatment have led to a range of treatment
processes, notably the AOPs. The correct choice of the UV lamp and quartz sleeve set is
important since these components can significantly affect the final process capital and
operational costs. The manufacturers provide portfolios with full specifications about the
lamps’ efficiency and energy consumption, as well as information regarding the quartz
sleeves absorption spectrum.45 2.6 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTFor the reactor design, there is not a simple path to be followed. The choice must con-
sider not only the effluent quantity but also its quality. In general, batch reactors are more
suitable for smaller volumes and bench-scale experiments, while CSTR and plug-flow
reactors are more flexible to work with larger volumes (such as pilot test units). For either
case, the complexity of the effluent may interfere on the final performance. Quality vari-
ables like suspended solids, DOC and dissolved inorganic compounds may change the
light transmission or scavengeOH radicals. Therefore, it is important to have an adequate
effluent characterization before defining the design and operational conditions of the treat-
ment unit.
Despite some of its applications are more viable than others (such as mineralization of
some compounds found in water, including some residual pharmaceuticals), the overall
conclusion is that the UV/H 2O2systems have found their place on the top of the list of the
most promising technologies for water and wastewater treatment.

3.1 INTRODUCTION
Global economic growth is increasing exponentially in the first century of the new
millennium, but at the same time, rapid urbanization and industrialization release
enormous volumes of wastewater imposing various adverse effects on human health and
grading the quality of the environment as a whole. It has been revealed that generation of
wastewaters with complex and recalcitrant molecules is increasing day by day. The
presence of these organic compounds in water poses a serious threat to public health since
most of them are toxic, endocrine disrupting, mutagenic, or potentially carcinogenic to
humans, animals. and aquatic life. There is a pressing demand for newer technologies for
the complete mineralization of wastewaters.
Several conventional treatment methods are available such as biological, adsorption,
chemical treatment, filtration, flocculation, activated charcoal and ion exchange resins for
wastewater remediation. It has been frequently observed that pollutants not amenable to
biological treatments may also be characterized by high chemical stability and/or by
strong difficulty to be completely mineralized. In this context, oxidation processes are pre-
ferred to degrade such biorefractory substances present in wastewater. However, pollution
load, process limitations, and operating conditions are the key factors to be considered
during the selection of the most appropriate oxidation process for the degradation of a
particular compound. Apart from high degradation efficiency, direct oxidation processes
demand specified operating conditions to degrade the target compounds, which will
increase the operation cost of the process.
49Advanced Oxidation Processes for Wastewater T reatment
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-810499-6.00003-6 ©2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The scope should encompass degradation as well as mineralization of organic contami-
nants to effectively treat recalcitrant effluent, i.e. conversion of the target molecule to its
highest stable oxidation state: water, carbon dioxide, and the oxidized inorganic anions or
to more easily degradable molecules, that can be removed biologically. Advanced oxida-
tion processes (AOPs) are suggested as an alternative powerful technique for wastewater
treatment processes to degrade recalcitrant organic compounds.
Glaze et al. (1987) defined AOPs as water treatment processes that produce very active
radicals for degradation of pollutants at near ambient temperature and pressure. Generally,
AOPs means a group of processes that produce hydroxyl radical, in which ozone and H 2O2
act as oxidants with the assistance of light, a catalyst (e.g. Fe21,F e31, and TiO 2), ultrasonic
insertion, and/or thermal input; and there are several combinations such as Fenton (H 2O2/
Fe21), photo-Fenton (H 2O2/UV/Fe21), peroxidation combined with ultraviolet light
(H2O2/UV), peroxone (O 3/H 2O2), peroxone combined with ultraviolet light (O 3/H 2O2/
UV), O 3/UV system, O 3/TiO 2/H 2O2,O 3/TiO 2/electron beam irradiation, etc. AOPs
typically operate with less energy requirement than direct oxidation. The classification of
conventional AOPs is based on the source used for the generation of hydroxyl radicals.
Several AOPs were identified and employed for the wastewater treatment, but Fenton
and photo-Fenton processes have proved to be the most powerful, effective, energetically
efficient, cost effective, and less tedious method for the treatment of recalcitrant com-
pounds, when used exclusively or coupled with conventional and biological methods.
These processes do not require sophisticated equipment or costly reagents and are ecolog-
ically viable because of their relatively simpler approach, use of less hazardous chemicals,
and cyclic in nature so that a less concentration of these chemicals are needed.
3.2 TYPES OF FENTON PROCESSES
Different types of Fenton processes are available such as Fenton, photo-Fenton,
electro-Fenton, photo-electro-Fenton, sono-Fenton, sono-photo-Fenton, sono-electro-
Fenton, homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton, photo-Fenton, hybrid Fenton, and
Fenton type processes ( Goi and Trapido, 2002 ).
3.2.1 Fenton Processes
The Fenton reaction was first reported by H. J. Fenton (1894) and it is described as the
enhanced oxidative potential of H 2O2, when iron (Fe) is used as a catalyst under acidic
conditions. The reactions involved in Fenton processes are ( Haber and Willsta ¨tter, 1931 ):
Fe211H2O2-Fe311/C15OH1OH2(3.1)
/C15OH1H2O2-HO/C15
21H2O (3.2)
Fe211/C15OH-Fe311OH2(3.3)
Fe311HO/C15
2-Fe211O21H1(3.4)
/C15OH1/C15OH-H2O2 (3.5)
Organic pollutant 1/C15OH-Degraded products (3.6)50 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTFenton-like reactions are reactions in which other metals, such as cobalt and copper, are
used at a low oxidation state ( Nerud et al., 2001; Prousek, 1995 ).
Cu11H2O2-Cu211/C15OH1OH2(3.7)
A study on the synergistic pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) using the Fenton
reaction and NaOH extraction was conducted by Zhang and Zhu (2016) . Sequential
pretreatments were performed in combination with the NaOH extraction and it was
concluded that among all the pretreatments, the Fenton pretreatment followed by the
NaOH extraction had the highest efficiency for enzymolysis and simultaneous saccharifi-
cation fermentation (SSF). The analyses revealed that the Fenton pretreatment disrupts the
structure of SCB to facilitate the degradation of lignin by NaOH. Nidheesh et al. (2013)
reviewed the degradation of dyes from aqueous solution by Fenton processes in which the
classification, characteristics, and problems of dyes were discussed. Fenton processes have
been classified and represented as Fenton circle. They also included some recent studies
on Fenton processes analyzing different configurations of reactors used for dye removal,
efficiency, and the effects of various operating parameters of Fenton processes.
U¨stu¨n et al. (2010) observed that degradation and mineralization of 3-indole butyric acid
(IBA) using Fenton and Fenton-like processes proceeded via two distinctive kinetic
regimes. The initial step of the reaction was a Fenton reaction (faster step) and it was fol-
lowed by a slower degradation step involving Fenton-like reactions, which was due to the
lower rate of generation of hydroxyl radicals. They showed that the Fenton process may be
more useful, if only IBA removal is required, but if mineralization of IBA is also needed,
then the Fenton-like process is more important due to high mineralization efficiency.
Matilainen and Sillanpa ¨a¨(2010) employed Fenton and photo-Fenton processes for the
removal of natural organic matter from drinking water. The quantum yield and electrical
energy per order (E(Eo)) efficiency of azo dyes by three advanced oxidation processes
(AOPs) has been assessed by Muruganandham et al. (2007) . Both dyes were completely
decolorized by all these processes. Among three AOPs, the Fenton process showed the
high decolorization efficiencies and low electrical energy consumption. Moreover, the
higher quantum yield was observed at a high initial dye concentration.
3.2.2 Photo-Fenton Processes
The combination of hydrogen peroxide and UV radiation with a Fe21or Fe31ion
produces more hydroxyl radicals and in turn, it increases the rate of degradation of
organic pollutants. Such a process is known as the photo-Fenton processes ( Kim and
Vogelpohl, 1998 ). Fenton reaction accumulates Fe31ions in the system and the reaction
does not proceed, once all Fe21ions are consumed. The photochemical regeneration of fer-
rous ions by photo-reduction of ferric ions occurs in the photo-Fenton reaction ( Eqs. 3.8
and 3.9 ). The newly generated ferrous ions react again with H 2O2generating hydroxyl
radical and ferric ion, and in this way, the cycle continues:
Fe311H2O1hν-Fe211/C15OH1H1(3.8)
Fe311H2O21hν-Fe211HO/C15
21H1(3.9)51 3.2 TYPES OF FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe photo-Fenton process offers better performance at pH 3.0, when the hydroxy /C0Fe31
complexes are more soluble and Fe(OH)21is more photoactive. The photo-Fenton process
was reported as more efficient than the Fenton treatment. In some cases, the use of sun-
light instead of UV irradiation also reduced the costs; however, this offers a lower degra-
dation rate of pollutants. Acidic conditions (about pH 3) were reported to be favorable,
and this may be mainly due to the conversion of carbonate and bicarbonate species into
carbonic acid, which has a low reactivity with hydroxyl radicals.
Malakootian et al. (2016) employed the photo-Fenton process in the removal of sodium
dodecyl sulphate from synthetic solutions and soft drink wastewater. They removed this
surfactant from real sample with efficiency of 71% in 30 min. Fenton and photo-Fenton
degradation of the β-blocker metoprolol (MET) at initial circumneutral pH was achieved
byRomero et al. (2015) , on addition of resorcinol. The effect of various parameters was
examined and intermediates were identified. The Fenton and photo-Fenton degradation
pathway of MET has also been proposed.
Carboxylic acids are formed during the degradation of organic pollutants in the photo-
Fenton reactions and these carboxylic acids form complexes with iron. A kinetic model
simulating the dynamic behaviors of the iron redox cycle and hydroxyl radical generation
was developed to know contributions of acids like citric acid, formic acid, malonic acid,
and oxalic acid. It was observed that citric acid and oxalic acid enhanced the rate of the
iron redox cycle as well as the photo-Fenton reaction, whereas formic acid and malonic
acid showed insignificant and rather adverse effects on the rate of degradation. However
the effects of carboxylic acids on the Fenton-like reaction were found to be insignificant.
These results in the photo-Fenton reaction have been attributed to the changes in the UV
light absorbance with formed Fe31/C0carboxylic acid complexes ( Baba et al., 2015 ).
Photo-Fenton degradation of rhodamine B was observed by Lagori et al. (2015) to com-
pare the use of two different laser wavelengths for improving dental bleaching.
Degradation of phenol by the solar photo-Fenton process using the compound parabolic
collectors reactor was studied by Alalm et al. (2017) and observed in the rate of a degrada-
tion reaction from costs point of view. The total costs for best results with maximum deg-
radation of phenol was found to be 2.54 h/m3.Da Silva et al. (2015) observed the
inhibitory effect of inorganic ion mixtures, such as chloride, nitrate, sulfate, carbonate, and
monophosphate on the photo-Fenton mineralization of phenol by two experimental
designs, i.e. fractional experimental design and central composite rotatable design
(CCRD). The inhibitory effect followed the sequence:
H2PO2
4cCl2.SO22
4.NO2
3/C25CO22

The photo-Fenton degradation of antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) at near neutral pH
was reported by using ferricarboxylates ( Pereira et al., 2014 ). Fe31/Oxalate/UV /C0Vis or
Fe31/Citrate/H 2O2/UV /C0Vis process was used to avoid the formation of Fe-OTC com-
plexes. A comparative study has also been made in the presence of different inorganic
anions and humic acids, and in two different real wastewater matrixes. The rice-husk-
based free electron-rich mesoporous activated carbon (MAC) was precarbonized and
activated by using phosphoric acid and then applied as a heterogeneous catalyst along
with the Fenton reagent for the oxidation of persistent organic compounds in the tannery
wastewater carrying high total dissolved solids wastewater ( Sekaran et al., 2014 ).52 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTXiao et al. (2014) examined the distinct effect of oxalate vs. malonate on iron-based photo-
catalytic technologies like the photo-Fenton process by evaluating the degradation effi-
ciency of rhodamine B. It was observed that photolysis of the Fe(III)-oxalato complex was
favorable due to the formation of O2
2,H O/C15
2, andOH while the activities of UV/Fe(III)
significantly decreased because of Fe(III)-malonate complexes.
A strategy was developed by Carra et al. (2013) to remove recalcitrant pollutants from
water using the solar photo-Fenton process at initial neutral pH by repeated iron additions
at highly acidic pH (2.8). The effect of a UV light source such as UV-A (near-UV), UV-C
(short-UV), and visible-light assisted the Fenton-like treatment and water matrix on toxic-
ity, and transformation products were observed by Molkenthin et al. (2013) . Different
parameters like degradation of bisphenol A, removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
and rates of H 2O2consumption were selected to assess the treatment performances in
pure water and raw, fresh water samples. Various transformation products were identified
and a reaction mechanism hydroxylation, dimerization, and ring opening steps were
proposed.
Rubio et al. (2013) compared the H 2O2/UV 254and photo-Fenton technologies as well as
the effect of bicarbonates and organic matter on the photo-Fenton reaction of Escherichia
coli. The efficiency of the treatment was compared for Milli-Q water, Leman lake water,
and artificial seawater. It was observed that the presence of bicarbonate showed a negative
effect on reaction by scavenging of theOH radicals whereas dissolved organic matter
showed a positive effect by increasing the rate of inactivation. They also opined that
despite the negative effect of bicarbonate ions, the AOPs, especially photo-Fenton pro-
cesses are effective for disinfection treatment.
Klamerth et al. (2013) developed a modified photo-Fenton process capable of working
at neutral pH for the treatment of wastewater. In this modification, ethylenediamine-N,
N’-disuccinic acid (EDDS) was used. Ortega-Go ´mez et al. (2012) developed a control
strategy to automate the hydrogen peroxide dosage to increase the efficiency of the
photo-Fenton process. A model was designed using paracetamol as the model
pollutant to explain the link between dynamic behavior of DO and hydrogen peroxide
consumption.
De la Cruz et al. (2012) highlighted the possibility of the degradation of micropollutants
such as pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, and biocides/pesticides in the presence of
dissolved organic matter in much higher concentrations at natural or near neutral pH.
They used UV-light (254 nm), dark Fenton (Fe21,31/H 2O2), and photo-Fenton (Fe21,31/
H2O2/light) processes. Guimara ˜es et al. (2012b) investigated the efficiency of various
AOPs for the degradation of RB-19 dye in which the photo-Fenton process was found to
be most efficient method showing removal of 94.5% of dissolved organic carbon and
99.4% of color. It was also reported that by combining a biological system with the photo-
Fenton process, the textile effluent can be degraded at a much higher level.
The effect of various aromatic derivatives on the advanced photo-Fenton degradation of
amaranth dye was studied by Devi et al. (2011) in which the following order of the rate of
reaction was reported:
Hydroquinones .Chlorophenol .Dichlorobenzene .Aromatic carboxylic acids .
Anilidine .Nitrophenol53 3.2 TYPES OF FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTA probable degradation mechanism has been proposed on the basis on the intermedi-
ates, and it was concluded that the degradation pathway is not altered by the addition of
these aromatic derivatives.
Maezono et al. (2011) examined the hydroxyl radical concentration profile in the photo-
Fenton oxidation process. The hydroxyl radical concentration was measured during the
decoloration of azo-dye orange II by using the scavenger probe or trapping technique. The
effects of various operating parameters were studied and it was found that the hydroxyl
radical generation was enhanced with increasing dosages of Fenton reagents. The dynamic
behavior of the hydroxyl radical concentration was found to be strongly linked with the
change in H 2O2concentration. Catalytic effect of inorganic additives like sodium thiosul-
fate and potassium bromate was observed by Jain et al. (2011) on the photo-Fenton degra-
dation of phenol red. The effect of variation of different parameters was observed and a
tentative mechanism for the reaction was also proposed.
Evaluation of two approaches namely, solar Fenton, homogeneous photocatalysis, and
heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide suspensions for the degradation of the
fluoroquinolone ofloxacin in secondary treated effluents was made by Michael et al.
(2010) . It was concluded that solar Fenton is the more effective technique for complete
degradation of this substrate, and DOC reduction of about 50% in 30 min of the photocata-
lytic treatment could be achieved. A parametric study was designed by Bouafia-Chergui
et al. (2010) to know the effects of [H 2O2], [Fe31], and [H 2O2]/[Fe31] ratio on the photo-
Fenton degradation of an azo dye basic blue 41. It was reported that the concentration of
H2O2, ferric iron, and BB41 as well as their ratio [H 2O2]/[Fe31] and the [H 2O2]/[BB41] are
key factors deciding the removal of BB41. 90% of TOC removal was obtained after 8 h of
irradiation time under these conditions of real wastewater. Decolorization of mordant red
73 azo dye in water using H 2O2/UV and the photo-Fenton treatment was investigated by
Elmorsi et al. (2010) . The effect of various operating parameters as well as the effect of
inorganic anions was also observed. It was found that the presence of chloride ion caused
a large decrease in the photodegradation rate, but the effect of nitrate and carbonate ions
was insignificant. The photo-Fenton treatment using Fe powder (a source of ferrous ions)
was found to be highly efficient. It was also found that the photo-Fenton treatment is
more efficient over the H 2O2/UV process.
A comparison among photocatalysis, the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes for the treat-
ment of catechol was made by Lofrano et al. (2009) in which the Fenton and photo-Fenton
processes exihibited a very high efficiency in the mineralization of catechol and removal of
aromaticity. Klamerth et al. (2009) identified degradation products and proposed pathway of
photo /C0Fenton degradation of chlorfenvinphos (CFVP). It was reported that CFVP and its
degradation products such as 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and triethylpho-
sphate were decomposed into organic substances like acetate, formate, maleate, and inorganic
ions like chloride and phosphate. On the basis of the complete absence of chlorinated ali-
phatic substances and chlorinated acids, it was concluded that chlorine is removed rapidly,
and that residual DOC does not correspond to any chlorinated compound.
Manzano et al. (2009) investigated the Fenton and photo-Fenton mediated degradation
process of orange II in a flow photo-reactor mediated by Fe-Nafion membranes. It was
reported that complete decolorization of orange II can be achieved within 1 h and dye is
mineralized in the presence of ferric ion (2 ppm) and an H 2O2/orange II ratio of 20.54 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTInhibitory effect of surfactants such as linear alkylbenzenesulfonates (LAS) and
K-perfluoroalkylsulfonate (FT 800) was also reported for the photo-Fenton processes.
The effect of system parameters and of inorganic salts on the decolorization and degra-
dation of procion H-exl dyes was investigated by Riga et al. (2007) . Various advanced oxi-
dation processes such as H 2O2/UV, Fenton, UV/Fenton, TiO 2/UV, and TiO 2/UV/H 2O2
were compared. They also reported adverse effects of some salts such as NaCl, Na 2CO 3,
NaHCO 3,N a 2SO4, NaNO 3,and Na 3PO4.
Litter and Slodowicz (2017) reviewed different aspects of Fenton and Fenton-like pro-
cesses for the removal of pollutants using zerovalent iron materials, including nanoparti-
cles. The use of the iron materials together with hydrogen peroxide addition has been
discussed. The use of biogenic generated iron nanoparticles for the removal of pollutants
may be preferred due to their novelty and economy of synthesis ( Fig. 3.1 ).
A kinetic study has been made by Kusic et al. (2006a) for the degradation of azo dyes
using Fenton and photo-Fenton type processes, in which the highest mineralization extent
was observed for UV/Fe0/H 2O2system. The iron catalyst concentration and the iron cata-
lyst/H 2O2ratio were optimized for Fenton type processes and then, Fe21/H 2O2and Fe0/
H2O2at optimal process parameters were combined with UV radiation to enhance dye
degradation. A quantum yield of acridine orange 7 was also determined.
The use of zerovalent iron (Fe0) microspheres for the degradation of 1,4-dioxane by
photo-Fenton processes was optimized in terms of pH and reagent dosage for the success-
ful treatment of industrial wastewaters ( Barndok et al., 2016 ). In UV photo-Fenton treat-
ment of synthetic waters, 1,4-dioxane was completely removed in 5 min. A significant
biodegradability enhancement (up to 60%) and almost total COD removal ( $90%) was
achieved in 10 min. and after 30 min, respectively. Sludge production and pH adjustments
can be avoided in this process and it makes the Fe0microspheres an efficient catalyst for
the treatment of relatively alkaline wastewaters containing 1,4-dioxane. They opined that
the solar driven process could be an important economical alternative to the UV catalyzed
process ( Fig. 3.2 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTMa et al. (2005) found that the presence of dyes having a quinone unit like alizarin
violet 3B can accelerate the photo-Fenton degradation of organic compounds. Complete
mineralization of compounds like salicylic acid, sodium benzenesulfonate, benzyltrimethy-
lammonium chloride, and trichloroacetic acid could be achieved by this dye catalyzed
photo-Fenton process. According to the proposed mechanism, this dye acts as a co-catalyst
to enhance the photo-Fenton reaction by catalyzing the cycle of Fe31/Fe21and transfer-
ring an electron from the excited dye molecule to Fe31.
The role of ferrous ion in Fenton and photo-Fenton processes for the degradation of
phenol was examined by Kavitha and Palanivelu (2004) . The efficiencies of Fenton, solar-
Fenton, and UV-Fenton were compared, where UV-Fenton processes showed maximum
mineralizing efficiency for degradation of phenol, which was used as a model compound.
These processes were also applied for the abatement of effluent from the phenol resin-
manufacturing unit.
The effect of substituents on the oxidation of azo dyes in the FeIII/C0EDTA /C0H2O2system
was examined at neutral pH by Nam et al. (2001) . Methyl, methoxy, and halo substituents
on the phenolic ring of 4-(4 ʹ-sulfophenylazo) phenol and 2-(4 ʹ-sulfophenylazo) phenol,
were chosen as model systems. It was reported that the mono- or dihalo- substituted dyes
were oxidized to a greater extent than the corresponding methyl- or methoxy-substituted
dyes. This effect can be attributed to the fact that halogen substituents make the phenolic
moieties more acidic, which favors the phenolate anion, and could be readily attacked by
hydroxyl radicals. The effect of Fe(III)-ligand properties on the effectiveness of modified
photo-Fenton processes was studied by Aplin et al. (2001) . A modified photo-Fenton
(UV/Fe oxalate/H 2O2) process was used for the degradation of reactive red 235. It was
concluded that oxalate ligand forms Fe(III)-oxalato complexes, which could be easily
photolyzed; and it is relatively unreactive with hydroxyl radicals.
The replacement of H 2O2by O 2in Fenton and photo-Fenton degradation of aniline was
examined by Utset et al. (2000) . It was found that the presence of H 2O2is necessary along
the reaction. It was also reported that an effective partial replacement of H 2O2by O 2as an

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTelectron acceptor takes place, when the ratio amount of aniline mineralized vs. initial ani-
line concentration is minimal. The photo-Fenton reaction and the TiO 2/UV process for
wastewater treatment were investigated by Bauer et al. (1999) in which it was reported
that the solar driven Fenton reaction is the most inexpensive method for water treatment
and could be used for highly contaminated effluents. Bandara et al. (1996) studied the
kinetics and quantum yield for sunlight induced photo-Fenton mineralization/decolora-
tion of concentrated orange II solutions. It was observed that besidesOH radicals, highly
stable Fe-complexes in combination with H 2O2are active in the abatement of this azo dye.
Degradation of some more pollutants and inactivation of bacteria is given in Table 3.1 .
3.3 ELECTRO-FENTON PROCESSES
Anodic oxidation and indirect electrooxidation are employed to achieve the mineraliza-
tion of toxic and biorefractory organic pollutants. In anodic oxidation, pollutants are min-
eralized by direct electron transfer reactions or action of radical species (hydroxyl radicals)
formed on the electrode surface. Anodic oxidation is carried out in the anodic compart-
ment of the divided cell, where the contaminated solution is treated using an anode. But it
was observed that under these conditions, most of the contaminants are poorly mineral-
ized. In electro-Fenton (EF) process, pollutants are destroyed by the action of Fenton’s
reagent in the bulk together with anodic oxidation at the anode surface.
The electro-Fenton (EF) process comprises of in situ electrochemical generation of H 2O2,
which readily decomposes to produce the hydroxyl radical species in an aqueous medium
catalyzed by iron ions. The relevant electrochemical reaction corresponds to the two elec-
tron reduction of dissolved oxygen under slightly acidic conditions. The presence of iron
ions accelerates the production ofOH radicals. This catalytic reaction is propagated from
Fe21regeneration, which mainly takes place by the reduction of Fe31ions with the H 2O2.
When the EF process is illuminated by means of UV-A light, it is named as photo-electro-
Fenton (PEF) process, which can accelerate the degradation of organic compounds by
the photolysis of Fe31-oxidation products complexes, and improving the ferrous ion
regeneration from the photoreduction of ferric ions. The ability of EF and PEF processes to
produce theOH radical with consequent oxidation of organic compounds make them
suitable for wastewater treatment.TABLE 3.1 Degradation by the Photo-Fenton Process

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTLe et al. (2015) developed a new cathode for the electro-Fenton process by electrochemi-
cal deposition of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) on the surface of carbon felt (CF), which
showed very high efficiency in the removal of dyes and good stability. An enhancement in
the production of hydrogen peroxide was also confirmed.
A comparative study was made by Olvera-Vargas et al. (2015) for the degradation of
pharmaceutical ranitidine (RNTD) by electro-Fenton and solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF)
processes using a pre-pilot flow plant with a Pt/air-diffusion cell. In SPEF, Pt anode and
air-diffusion cathode were used and the cell was coupled to a flat solar photoreactor to
irradiate the solution with sunlight. The higher oxidation ability of SPEF compared to EF
was attributed to the potent combined action of hydroxyl radicals and photolysis. Malic,
pyruvic, acetic, oxalic, oxamic, and formic acids were detected as final products. Electro-
Fenton process has also been utilized in degradation of other pollutants ( Table 3.2 ).
3.4 SONO-FENTON AND SONO-PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
Now-a-days, ultrasound has also been used for the degradation of chemical contami-
nants. Ultrasound is a sound wave with a frequency greater than the upper limit of human
hearing, i.e. approximately 20 kHz. The application of an ultrasound wave creates expan-
sion and compression cycles. The expansion cycle can result in acoustic cavitation. Before
implosion, the cavities oscillate in size, following the expansion and compression cycles of
the ultrasound wave. When these cavitation bubbles implode, several hundred of atmo-
sphere pressure and several thousand Kelvin temperature can be achieved ( Suslick et al.,
1990 ). Under these conditions, organic compounds are decomposed either by direct pyro-
lytic cleavage, or the hydroxyl radicals formed by pyrolysis.
Fenton and sonolysis can be combined together. These methods exploit the advantages
of both ultrasound and Fenton’s reagent; which can enhance the degradation of organic
pollutants ( Liang et al., 2007 ). Hydrogen peroxide is again produced by the recombination
of hydroxyl radicals, but by the application of UV lightthe amount of hydroxyl radicals isTABLE 3.2 Degradation by Electro-Fenton Processes

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTagain increased. The intermediate complex formed due to the reaction of Fe31with H 2O2
during the Fenton reaction could be reduced to Fe21by sonolysis and photolysis. It was
observed that the amount of ferrous salt required under SPF condition is very small as
compared to the Fenton condition. SPF process also reduces the amount of ferrous ions
present in the treated water, and this is very important from an industrial point of view.
The plasma-modified clinoptilolite (PMC) nanorods were prepared from natural clinop-
tilolite (NC) by Khataee et al. (2016a,b) using environmental benign corona discharge
plasma. The catalytic performance of the PMC in the heterogeneous sono-Fenton-like pro-
cess was observed and compared with NC. The greater efficiency of PMC catalyst was
reported for treatment of phenazopyridine (PhP). Similarlily, PMC nanorods were pre-
pared from oxygen, nitrogen nonthermal plasma, and argon glow discharge plasma to
achieve expedient degradation of reactive blue 69 (RB69) degradation and reactive red 84,
respectively. Patil and Gogate (2015) studied different combined treatment processes such
as ultrasound (US)/TiO 2, solar/TiO 2, US/solar/TiO 2, US/H 2O2, US/Fenton, and US/
ozone for the degradation of dichlorvos pesticide. A high efficacy for removal of dichlor-
vos was reported for TiO 2/solar (78.42%) and US/Fenton (81.19%) processes. Sono-Fenton
and sono-photo-Fenton systems were used for degradation of more pollutants ( Table 3.3 ).
3.5 HETEROGENEOUS FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
Major disadvantages associated with homogeneous Fenton processes include formation
of high amounts of metal-containing sludges at the end of the process, which imposes a
detrimental effect on the environment and a large amount of the catalytic metals are lost;
thus, leading to an increase in the costs associated. Due to these difficulties, several efforts
have been made to use solid supports for the active iron species. These materials are
required to exhibit high catalytic activity and stability; and metal should not be lost by
leaching. Attempts have also been directed toward the immobilization of iron species on
different solid supports or the use of insoluble iron oxides such as goethite, magnetite,
and hematite in order to simplify iron separation. This process is named as the heteroge-
neous Fenton reaction. The heterogeneous Fenton process is conceptually attractive and
practical, because it does not require the sludge separation step; thus it reduces cost ofTABLE 3.3 Degradation by Sono-Fenton and Sono-Photo-Fenton Processes

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENToperation. Various supports for the Fe species such as silica, clay, activated carbon, resins,
nafion, zeolite etc. have been used to fabricate heterogeneous Fenton catalysts. A novel
technique using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS) in the presence of
zerovalent metallic iron (Fe0) in the photo-Fenton process has been developed by Devi
et al. (2016) . PMS was found to be a better oxidant due to its dipolar unsymmetrical struc-
ture, higher oxidation potential, and lower LUMO energy. The following order was
observed in the rate of degradation reaction for various oxidation processes:

Degradation of 4-nitrophenol has been investigated on iron-enriched hybrid
montmorillonite-alginate beads (Fe-MABs) by Barreca et al. (2014) using the solar photo-
Fenton process. These beads were prepared by the ion-gelation method from alginate and
montmorillonite clay suspension dropped in a calcium chloride solution whereas iron-
enriched beads (Fe-MABs) were prepared using iron-exchanged montmorillonite. A good
removal efficiency of these hybrid beads was also reported for the first three cycles. Wang
et al. (2014) prepared Fe(II)Fe(III)-LDHs by coprecipitation method, and studied its cata-
lytic effect in heterogeneous-Fenton degradation of methylene blue.
It is of great importance to synthesize easily separable and eco-friendly efficient cata-
lysts for photocatalytic and photo-Fenton degradation for environment remediation appli-
cation. Ammonia-modified graphene (AG) sheets decorated with Fe 3O4nanoparticles
(AG/Fe 3O4) as a magnetically recoverable photocatalyst was synthesized by Boruah et al.
(2017) . They functionalized graphene oxide (GO) sheets by an amide functional group
followed by doping Fe 3O4nanoparticles (NPs) onto the functionalized GO surface.
As-prepared AG/Fe 3O4nanocomposite showed higher photocatalytic activity toward deg-
radation of phenol (92.43%), 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) (98%), and 2-chlorophenol (2-CP)
(97.15%) within 70 /C0120 min whereas 93.56% phenol, 98.76% 2-NP, and 98.06% of 2-CP
degradation were achieved within 50 /C080 min. using photo-Fenton degradation under sun-
light irradiation. It was proposed that the synergistic effect between amide functionalized
graphene and Fe 3O4nanoparticles enhances the photocatalytic activity by preventing the
recombination rate of the electron-hole-pair in these NPs. In addition, AG/Fe 3O4nano-
composite can be reused up to ten cycles ( Fig. 3.3 ).
A ternary nanocomposite with TiO 2nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide
(rGO)-encapsulated Fe 3O4spheres (Fe 3O4@rGO@TiO 2) was synthesized by depositing
TiO 2nanoparticles on the surface of the Fe 3O4spheres wrapped by graphene oxide (GO)
and used as a high efficient heterogeneous catalyst for photo-Fenton degradation of recal-
citrant pollutants under neutral pH ( Yang et al., 2015a,b ). The as-prepared catalyst
reflected good ferromagnetism and superior stability, making its separation convenient so
that it can be recycled. A swift reduction of Fe31to Fe21can be achieved due to the syner-
gic effects between the different components composing the catalyst. This catalyst exhib-
ited enhanced activity for the degradation of azo-dyes as compared with Fe 3O4,
Fe3O4@SiO 2@TiO 2,or SiO 2@rGO@TiO 2. It was concluded that the composite catalyst pos-
sesses a great potential for visible-light driven destruction of organic pollutants ( Fig. 3.4 ).60 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES

lonite nanocomposite by using sodium exchanged montmorillonite by cation-exchange,
gallery-templated synthesis, and impregnation method. This could be used as a catalyst in
the photo-Fenton process for the quick removal of organic dyes such as acid blue and reac-
tive blue, in which 100% degradation was reported within 30 min with a high concentra-
tion of dye. The efficacy of this catalyst can be attributed to small particle sizes,
mesoporosity, and fast reduction of Fe31.
Zhang et al. (2013) examined the novel reactor for the degradation of organic pollutants
by coupling the heterogeneous photo-Fenton like oxidation with membrane separation.
This reactor consisted of a Xe lamp, a submerged membrane module, and FeVO 4(catalyst)
with high activity. It was found that the catalyst was successfully left in the reactor, which
can be continuously reused.
Zhao et al. (2012) developed bifunctional iron modified rectorite as an efficient adsor-
bent and photo-Fenton catalyst for removal of organic contaminants. It was reported that
this modification has increased the layer-to-layer spacing and the surface area of rectorite,
which in turn increased the adsorption of rhodamine B on rectorite. This modification also
enabled rectorite to show efficient visible light photocatalytic ability by catalyzing the
decomposition of H 2O2into hydroxyl radicals.
A novel catalyst was prepared by immobilizing Fe(III) onto collagen fiber; and its high
activity as a catalyst for the Fenton degradation of dyes under irradiation of UVC was
reported by Tang et al. (2005) . A laponite clay-based Fe nanocomposite (Fe-Lap-RD) was
also employed for the photo-Fenton degradation of reactive red HE-3B by Feng et al.
(2003) . A high specific surface area and high total pore volume was reported for this nano-
composite, which led to a high catalytic performance in the degradation process.
Degradation of rhodamine B and 2,4-dichlorophenol by the photo-Fenton-like system with
hematite was reported by Zhang et al. (2012) . A number of other contaminants have been
successfully degraded by heterogeneous Fenton and photo-Fenton processes ( Table 3.4 ).
3.6 COMBINED (HYBRID) FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON
PROCESSES
Solar photo-Fenton treatment combined with nanofiltration to remove microcontami-
nants in real municipal effluents was investigated in order to achieve low cost strategy by
Miralles-Cuevas et al. (2017) . The photo-Fenton process was operated at circumneutral pH
using (S,S)-ethylenediamine-N,N ʹ-disuccinic acid trisodium salt (EDDS) as the iron com-
plexing agent. The effect of homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton type reagents (using
Fe containing ZSM-5 zeolite) on the removal of orange II has been investigated together
with the effect of UV irradiation in combination with ultrasound both alone, and with the
homogeneous Fenton-type reagent ( Du¨kkanci et al., 2014 ).Chen et al. (2014) deigned a
novel method by combining the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction and photocatalysis
using Co-TiO 2nanocatalyst for activation of KHSO 4with visible light irradiation at ambi-
ent conditions. Excellent catalytic stability and reusability have been observed with almost
no dissolution of Co21. The effects of the calcination temperature and cobalt concentration62 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTon the synergistic performance were examined and a possible mechanism for the synergis-
tic system has also been proposed.
A magnetic ZnFe 2O4-reduced graphene oxide hybrid was successfully developed and
employed as the heterogeneous catalyst for photo-Fenton-like decolorization of various
dyes using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by Yao et al. (2014) . It was found that this combina-
tion of ZnFe 2O4NPs with graphene sheets leads to a much higher catalytic activity and
stability than pure ZnFe 2O4.
Kim et al. (2012) assessed the synergistic effects of TiO 2photocatalysis in combination
with Fenton-like reactions on oxidation of organic compounds at circumneutral pH. It was
concluded that the synergistic effects result from dual roles of iron as an electron acceptor
to facilitate charge separation in a TiO 2photocatalyst and as a Fenton reagent. It was also
suggested that the adsorption of iron onto the photoexcited TiO 2surface modifies electron
transfer properties of iron toward H 2O2at neutral pH to convert the resultant reactive oxi-
dant from Fe(IV) into a stronger form, likelyOH.
The degradation of bisphenol A by an advanced oxidation process that combines sono-
lysis, Fe21, and TiO 2in a photoassisted process was reported by Torres-Palma et al. (2010) .

3.7 APPLICATIONS
3.7.1 Dyes
Photocatalytic decolorization of dyes using AOP is a recent concern among researchers
since it offers an attractive method for decolorization of dyes and breaks them into simple
mineral form. The oxidation using Fenton reagent has been found to be a promising treat-
ment method for the effective decolorization and degradation of dyes. An investigation of
photodegradation of basic orange 12 using H 2O2/Fe31has been carried out ( Kumar and
Ameta, 2013 ).
Dark- and photo-Fenton type processes, Fe21/H 2O2,F e31/H 2O2,F e0/H 2O2, UV/Fe21/
H2O2, UV/Fe31/H 2O2,and UV/Fe0/H 2O2, were applied for the treatment of model col-
ored wastewater containing two reactive dyes, reactive blue 49 and reactive blue 137; and
degradation kinetics have been compared by Kusic et al. (2009) Reactive azo dye procion
red H-E7B solutions have been submitted to solar-assisted photo-Fenton degradation.
Heteroatom oxidation products like NH1
4;NO2
3;Cl2;SO22
4and short chain carboxylic
acid were quantified ( Garcı ´a-Montan ˜o et al., 2008a,b ).Zheng et al. (2007) investigated the
oxidation of acidic dye eosin Y with the Fenton process and photo-Fenton process (solar
light or artificial light source), and also proved that oxalic acid could improve the photoca-
talytic efficiency in the solar-Fenton process.
The UV /C0vis spectral changes of amido black 10B in aqueous solution during the
Fenton treatment process at low H 2O2and Fe21concentrations were studied by Sun et al.
(2007) . It was observed that it is easier to destruct the azo linkage group than to destruct
the aromatic rings of amido black 10B by Fenton oxidation. The experimental results
showed that the Fenton oxidation process was an effective process for the degradation of
azo dye amido black 10B.
Daneshvar and Khataee (2006) compared the removal of azo dye, acid red 14, a com-
mon textile, and leather dye, from contaminated water using Fenton, UV/H 2O2,U V /
H2O2/Fe(II), UV/H 2O2/Fe(III), and UV/H 2O2/Fe(III)/oxalate processes, and the results
showed that its decolorization efficiency at the reaction time of 2 min follows the order:
UV =H2O2=Fe IIIðÞ =oxalate .UV =H2O2=Fe IIIðÞ.UV =H2O2=Fe IIðÞ.UV =H2O2
Zheng and Xiang (2004) used photo-Fenton oxidation processes for the degradation of
rhodamine B and COD, which can be removed effectively at the same time. The photode-
gradation of three commercially available dyestuffs (reactive black 5, direct yellow 12, and
direct red 28) by UV, UV/H 2O2,and UV/H 2O2/Fe21processes was investigated in a
laboratory scale batch photoreactor equipped with a 16 W immersed-type low-pressure
mercury vapor lamp (2004).64 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTNeamtu et al. (2003) evaluated the degradation of two azo reactive dyes, reactive yellow
84 and reactive red 120 by photo-Fenton and Fenton-like oxidation, and the results show
that the color removal of reactive yellow 84 after 15 min reaction time follows the decreas-
ing order:
Solar =Fe21=H2O2.UV =Fe21=H2O2.UV =Cu21=Fe31=H2O2.UV =Fe31oxalate =H2O2.
UV =Fe31=H2O2.Dark =Fe21=H2O2.Solar =Fe31oxalate =H2O2.UV =H2O2.UV =Fe215UV
During the same reaction period, the relative order for the reactive red 120 removal rate
was slightly different:

The homogeneous photocatalytic degradation of cationic acridine orange monohy-
drochloride and anionic alizarin violet 3B in the photo-Fenton system under visible irradi-
ation has been studied by Xie et al. (2000) . The generated intermediates during
degradation processes of acridine orange were found to be N,N-dimethyl formaldehyde
and N,N-dimethyl acetamide. Ammonium ions were also formed during the degradation
of acridine orange through the ion-selective electrode analysis.
Wu et al. (1999) studied the photodegradation of malachite green under visible light
irradiation ( λ.470 nm) in the presence of Fe31/H 2O2or Fe21/H 2O2in comparison with
the dark reaction. A probable degradation mechanism of malachite green by Fe31/H 2O2
under visible irradiation has been discussed, which involves an electron transfer from the
excited dye by visible light into Fe31in the initial photo-Fenton degradation. Conversion
of Fe31to Fe21was detected in the degradation process of malachite green. More dyes
were degraded by these processes and are summarized in Table 3.5 .
3.7.2 Agrochemicals
The occurrence of significant amounts of biocidal finishing agents in the environment
as a consequence of intensive textile finishing activities has become a subject of major pub-
lic health concern and scientific interest.
Chlorpyrifos, lambda-cyhalothrin, and diazinon were the major contaminants found in
the wastewater. Therefore, solar photo-Fenton and solar TiO 2photocatalysis processes
were used by Alalm et al. (2015b) for degradation of these from real industrial wastewater.
The degradation of 2-chloro-4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazine in aqueous solutions by the photo-
Fenton process has been investigated by Dbira et al. (2014) . The results of total organic
carbon (TOC) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) analyses have shown that no carbon diox-
ide (CO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) are formed during photo-Fenton treatment of aqueous
solutions of triazine. These results indicate that only substituent groups of the triazine ring
are released; however, nitrogen atoms of the triazine ring remain unaffected. The degrada-
tion of 2-chloro-4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazine starts by a rapid release of chlorine atoms as
chloride ions to form 2-hydroxy-4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazine. The amino groups of
2-hydroxy-4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazine are oxidized into nitro groups by hydroxyl radicals to
form 2-hydroxy-4,6-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine, which undergoes a slow release of nitro groups,65 3.7 APPLICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTand their substitution with hydroxyl groups to form cyanuric acid and nitrate ions. The
degradation of cyanuric acid by the photo-Fenton process has also been investigated.
Sa´nchez et al. (2013) reported the economic evaluation of a combined photo-Fenton/MBR
process using pesticides as the model pollutant.
Vilar et al. (2012) investigated the enhancement in biodegradability of a pesticide-
containing wastewater from phytopharmaceutical plastic containers washing. They used a
solar photo-Fenton treatment step followed by a biological oxidation process.
Transformation of 2,4-dichlorophenol by H 2O2/UV-C, Fenton, and photo-Fenton oxidation
products and toxicity has been evaluated by Karci et al. (2012) . Hydroquinone and formicTABLE 3.5 Degradation of Some Dyes

nol, 4-chlorophenol, and 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone were identified as the additional
H2O2/UV-C oxidation products of 2,4-dichlorophenol.
Farre´et al. (2005) degraded some biorecalcitrant pesticides (alachlor, atrazine, chlorfen-
vinphos, diuron, isoproturon, and pentachlorophenol) by homogeneous photo-Fenton/
ozone (PhFO) and heterogeneous TiO 2-photocatalysis/ozone (PhCO) coupled systems;
while Derbalah et al. (2004) investigated the photocatalytic removal kinetics of fenitrothion
at a concentration of 0.5 mg/L in pure and natural waters in Fe31/H 2O2/UV /C0Vis, Fe31/
UV/C0Vis and H 2O2/UV /C0Vis oxidation systems, with respect to decrease in fenitrothion
concentrations with irradiation time using a solar simulator. Other agrochemicals
degraded by these processes are tabulated in Table 3.6 .
3.7.3 Pharmaceuticals
The pharmaceutical residues in municipal, surface, ground, and potable water create
water pollution as these have adverse impacts on human health, even if present in low
concentrations. These drugs are released into the wastewater during manufacture and
improper disposal of unused or expired medicines. The risks associated with pharmaceuti-
cal contamination of the aquatic environment had been an emerging issue. Drugs are
designed to have a particular biological effect and, therefore, some adverse environmental
risks are expected from the exposure to these drugs. A number of pharmaceuticals pose
undesired impacts on humans, animals, and aquatic organisms.
Orbeci et al. (2014) evaluated a modified photo-Fenton procedure as a suitable advanced
oxidative process to degrade antibiotics in aqueous solutions. The classical photo-Fenton
procedure was modified using a photocatalytic reactor with continuous recirculation,
which was equipped with a high pressure cylindrically shaped mercury lamp centrally and
coaxially positioned and surrounded by iron mesh. Photo-Fenton degradation of the sulfon-
amide antibiotics, sulfadiazine and sulfathiazole, mediated by Fe31-oxalate was studied by
Batista and Nogueira (2012) . Characterization of the degradation performance of the sulfa-
methazine antibiotic by the photo-Fenton process has been reported by Pe´rez-Moya et al.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENThas been studied by Radjenoviæ et al. (2010) . The degradation of flumequine and nalidixic
acid in distilled water by two solar photocatalytic processes, TiO 2and photo-Fenton, was
also evaluated.
Dipyrone is an analgesic drug, which is very quickly hydrolyzed to 4-
methylaminoantipyrine (4-MAA) in an acidic solution. A batch study was conducted by
Giri and Golder (2014) . to compare the performance of different oxidation processes such
as Fenton (FP), photo-Fenton (PFP), UV/H 2O2photolysis (UVP), and UV/TiO 2photocata-
lysis (UVPC) for removal of 4-MAA from an aqueous solution. They evaluated degrada-
tion efficiency in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) reduction and enhancement of
biodegradability. Maximum 4-MAA removals of 94.1%, 96.4%, 74.4%, and 71.2% were
achieved in FP, PFP, UCP, and UVPC, respectively, against mineralization of 49.3%,
58.2%, 47%, and 24.6%, respectively. The proposed mechanisms suggest that the cleavage
of three methyl moieties followed by pyrazolinone ring breakage led to formation of vari-
ous intermediates. These intermediates were hydroxylated and carboxylic derivatives.
3-Aminopyridine (3AP) is used in the manufacture of anti-inflammatory drugs. It is
also as a plant growth regulator, which is one of the emerging pollutants, because of
its toxic nature, carcinogenic potential, and hazardous effects on the natural environment.
Its degradation by advanced oxidation technologies like Fenton and Photo-Fenton oxida-
tion has been reported by Karale et al. (2014) . The effect of various operating parameters
like pH, hydrogen peroxide, iron salts (both ferrous and iron extracted from laterite soil)
and reaction time were observed. Optimum ratio of [H 2O2]:[Fe21]: 24/C040:1 showed up to
(90% /C077%) removal efficiency for Fenton’s oxidation at pH 3. Photo-Fenton oxidation
studies showed 100% removal for concentration range (10 /C030 mg/L) under both iron salts.
Fenton’s oxidation required reaction time of 5 h for 10 /C030 mg/L to 7 h for 40 /C060 mg/L,
and finally to 8.5 h for 70 /C080 mg/L of 3AP while photo-Fenton oxidation required much
less reaction time equal to 1.5 h for 10 /C030 mg/L to 2 h for 40 /C060 mg/L, and 4 h for
70/C080 mg/L.
The solar photo-Fenton process for degradation of four types of pharmaceuticals (amox-
icillin, ampicillin, diclofenac, and paracetamol) was studied by Alalm et al. (2015a,b) .
Oxidation of each pharmaceutical was investigated individually using 100 mg/L of a syn-
thetic solution. Effect of irradiation time, initial pH value, and dosage of the Fenton
reagent were investigated. Paracetamol and amoxicillin were completely removed after 60
and 90 min of irradiation, respectively while complete degradation of ampicillin and diclo-
fenac required more than 120 min. Complete removal of all pharmaceuticals was achieved
under strongly acidic conditions (pH 53). Optimum dosage of H 2O2,FeSO 4and, 7H 2O
were 1.5 and 0.5 g/L, respectively.
Elmolla and Chaudhuri (2010) examined photo-Fenton treatment of an antibiotic waste-
water containing amoxicillin and cloxacillin. The effect of operating conditions (H 2O2:COD
molar ratio and H 2O2:Fe21molar ratio) on biodegradability (BOD5:COD ratio) improve-
ment and mineralization was evaluated. Optimum operating conditions for treatment of
the antibiotic wastewater were found to be H 2O2:COD molar ratio 2.5 and H 2O2:Fe21
molar ratio 20 (COD:H 2O2:Fe21molar ratio 1:2.5:0.125) at pH 53 and reaction time being
30 min. Under these conditions, complete degradation of amoxicillin and cloxacillin was68 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTobserved in 1 min, biodegradability improved from 0.09 to 0.50 60.01 in 30 min, and COD
and DOC removal were found to be 67 61% and 51 62%, respectively in 30 min.
Degradation rates and removal efficiencies of propranolol using UV-C direct photolysis,
H2O2, UV-C/H 2O2, UV-C/Fe21,H 2O2/Fe21, and UV-C/H2O 2/Fe21were studied by
Baydum et al. (2012) . The results showed that the oxidation rate was increased on increas-
ing the hydrogen peroxide concentrations during the UV-C/H 2O2treatment. Addition of
more ferrous ions enhanced the oxidation rate for the H 2O2/Fe21and UV-C/H 2O2/Fe21
processes. It was possible to remove more than 80% from the propranolol concentration of
20 mg/L in 5 min using the photo-Fenton process.
Characterization and treatment of a real pharmaceutical wastewater containing 775 mg
dissolved organic carbon per liter were studied by Sirtori et al. (2009) using a solar photo-
Fenton/biotreatment, This wastewater contained nalidixic acid (45 mg/L), an antibiotic
belonging to the quinolone group. Thephoto-Fenton process enhanced the biodegradability
of nalidixic acid followed by a biological treatment. Nalidixic acid completely disappeared
after 190 min. The photo-Fenton treatment time (190 min) and H 2O2dose (66 mM) were
found necessary for adequate biodegradability of the wastewater. Overall degradation effi-
ciency of the combined photo-Fenton and biological treatment was over 95%, out of which,
33% corresponds to the solar photochemical process and remaining 62% to the biological
treatment.
3.7.4 Petroleum Refinery Effluents
Water produced in oil fields is one of the main sources of wastewater generated in the
industry. It contains several organic compounds such as, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene,
and xylene (BTEX). Presently, the rise in the generation of extremely toxic and refractory
wastewaters(as petroleum refinery plant effluents), is demanding increasingly efficient
treatment technologies, where photo-Fenton advanced oxidation processes have entered
the scene due to their rapid and effective degradation of petroleum-derived pollutants.
Petrochemical wastewater treatment using the photo-Fenton process has been suggested
byRubio-Clemente et al. (2015) , while Cho et al. (2006) treated the petroleum gas station’s
groundwater samples contaminated by BTEX and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs)
with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as TiO 2photocatalysis and Fe21/H 2O2
exposed to solar light.
Detoxification of synthetic and real groundwater contaminated with gasoline and diesel
using H 2O2,H 2O21UV, Fenton, photo-Fenton, and biofilters was made by Torres et al.
(2016) . A comparative study of solar photo-Fenton, and solar photocatalysis of TiO 2com-
bined with the Fenton process to treat petroleum wastewater was also made by
Aljubourya et al. (2016) .
Rocha et al. (2013) investigated the treatment of petroleum-extraction wastewater by
means of a photo-Fenton like process using sunlight as an irradiation source. A reduction
of the wastewater UV absorption spectral intensity indicates that polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons and aromaticity removal of approximately 92.7% and 96.2%, respectively69 3.7 APPLICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTwere obtained after 7 h of sunlight exposure. Da Silva et al. (2012) reported a treatment of
polluted water by integrating two processes, i.e., induced air flotation (IAF) and photo-
Fenton for treatment of residual waters contaminated with xylene. Guimara ˜es et al.
(2012a) assessed the application of AOPs in the treatment of stripped sour water from the
Petrobras Replan oil refinery. Oxidative mineralization of petroleum refinery effluent
using a Fenton-like process has been described by Hasan et al. (2012). Tony et al. (2012)
also treated the oil refinery wastewater, contaminated with hydrocarbon oil, using
physico-chemical, Fenton and photo-Fenton oxidation processes.
3.7.5 Surfactants
Surfactants are harmful for fish and human beings; and they are the main ingredients
of synthetic detergents. Surfactants are widely used in soap, toothpaste, cleaning deter-
gents, shampoo, etc. They also have numerous industrial applications in cosmetic and
medicinal products, textiles, foodstuffs, paper, oil recovery, paints, polymers, pesticides,
mining, etc. They are discharged to surface water and groundwater through household
and industrial wastewaters. They also cause foam in rivers and effluent treatment
plants, and reduce water quality; surfactants also cause short and long term damage to
the environment. Combined Fenton oxidation and aerobic biological processes for
treating a surfactant wastewater containing abundant sulfate have been investigated by
Wang et al. (2008) .
Pagano et al. (2008) carried out oxidation of 10 nonionic surfactants (6 alcohol ethoxy-
lates and 4 alkylphenol ethoxylates) by Fenton and H 2O2/UV processes in synthetic (deio-
nized water) and real aqueous matrices. Mixtures of the 10 surfactants were treated in
both; synthetic and real matrices. Fenton treatment of municipal secondary effluents con-
taining the surfactants mixture led to its complete removal on using a molar ratio [Total
surfactants]:[H 2O2]:[Fe21] equal to 1:17:12 was used.
Anionic alkylbenzene sulfonate (ABS) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), are
being widely used in household and industrial detergents; and these were degraded by
Lin et al. (1999) using the Fenton treatment. The effects of pH, amounts of ferrous sulfate
and hydrogen peroxide, and temperature on the surfactant removal were studied. It was
observed that chemical coagulation improved the turbidity and removal of dissolved Fe
after the Fenton process. A first-order kinetic model was adopted to represent the Fenton
oxidation of surfactant wastewater.
The oxidative degradation of two dyes and a nonionic surfactant by iron(II) sulphate
and hydrogen peroxide was studied in the presence and absence of UV irradiation
(Fenton and photo-Fenton processes) ( Ferrero, 2000 ). The degradation kinetics were fol-
lowed by measuring the residual total organic carbon (TOC) value as a function of time at
different initial TOC concentrations and temperatures. It was observed that the residual
TOC values attained a stable level after a given treatment time; even in the case of some
dyehouse effluent samples.
Miranzadeh et al. (2016) investigated the effectiveness of Fenton and photo-Fenton pro-
cesses for the treatment of anionic surfactants from aqueous solutions. Linear alkyl70 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTbenzene sulfonate (LAS) was selected as a model system. It was revealed that the mean
removal efficiency of LAS in Fenton and photo-Fenton in 20 min reaction time with con-
stant concentration of hydrogen peroxide (100 mg/L) and 20 mg/L ferrous iron (20 mg/L)
were 20.16% and 22.47%, respectively. LAS removal efficiency was increased to 69.38%
and 86.66% in 80 min reaction time for hydrogen peroxide (800 mg/L) and ferrous ion
(120 mg/L), respectively.
Solar photodegradation of two commercial surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
and dodecyl benzene sulfonate (DBS), has been studied by Amat et al. (2004) . It was
observed that photo-Fenton reaction was the most effective method. In the photo-Fenton
process, one can also use Cr(III). This could be interesting in the case of wastewaters con-
taining chromium from a leather related industry. It was found easier to degrade DBS
than SDS. Degradation yields higher than 80% were obtained in less than 3 h of exposure
to sunlight; however, the best results were obtained again using iron salts as photocata-
lysts (photo-Fenton).
3.7.6 Leachates
Landfilling is the most common method of solid waste management in the country.
Leachate management is a major problem concerned with landfill. Leachate can pollute
surface and subsurface water sources. Advanced oxidation processes, such as photo-
Fenton is an effective treatment method, where hydroxyl radicals are generated and used
in pollutant degradation. Landfill leachate is one kind of the most harmful types of high
concentration organic wastewaters. The effective processing method is necessary to
improve the treating efficiency of landfill leachate. Aqueous oxidation treatment of COD
and color in landfill leachate with the combination of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion
(Fenton reagent) has been studied by Chen et al. (2014) while Ding et al. (2012) treated the
landfill leachate by the microwave-Fenton oxidation process catalyzed by Fe21loaded on
granular activated carbon. Optimization of Fenton and photo-Fenton-based advanced oxi-
dation processes for post treatment of composting leachate of municipal solid waste by an
activated sludge process has been suggested by Mahdad et al. (2016) .
Advanced oxidation processes like Fenton and photo-Fenton have been effectively
applied to oxidize the persistent organic compounds in solid waste leachate and convert
them to harmless products. Zazouli et al. (2012) studied the effect of different variables
on the treatment of municipal landfill leachate by Fenton, Fenton-like, and photo-Fenton
processes. The results showed that the optimum concentration of H 2O2required was
equal to 5 g/L for the Fenton-like process and 3 g/L for the Fenton and photo-Fenton
processes. The optimum ratio of H 2O2:F e21/Fe31were 8:1 in all processes. At optimum
conditions, the amount of COD removal was found to be 69.6%, 65.9%, and 83.2% in
Fenton, Fenton-like, and photo-Fenton processes, respectively. Biodegradability (BOD5/
COD ratio) of the treated leachate was increased after all processes as compared to that
of the raw leachate. Highest increase in BOD5/COD ratio was observed in the photo-
Fenton process ( Fig. 3.5 ).71 3.7 APPLICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe solar photo-Fenton reaction parameters in the oxidation of a sanitary landfill leach-
ate at lab-scale have been given by Tireli et al. (2015) . They also tried to elucidate the role
of ferric hydroxides, ferric sulphate, and ferric chloride species, by taking advantage of
ferric speciation diagrams, in the efficiency of the photo-Fenton reaction, when applied to
leachate oxidation. The molar fraction of the most photoactive ferric species, FeOH21,
was linearly correlated with the photo-Fenton pseudo-first order kinetic constants
obtained at different solution pH and temperature values. Ferric ion speciation diagrams
showed that the presence of high amounts of chloride ions adversely affected the photo-
Fenton reaction, due to the decrease of the solubility of ferric ions and scavenging of
hydroxyl radicals for chlorine radical formation. The increment of the photo-Fenton reac-
tion rates with temperature was mainly associated with the increase of the molar fraction
of FeOH21.
3.7.7 Other Pollutants
Wide use of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) as fuel oxygenates led to worldwide envi-
ronment contamination, basically due to fuel leaks from storage or pipelines. Therefore,
Levchuk et al. (2014) provided an overview of recent developments in technologies for
MTBE removal from water. Bisphenol-A is ubiquitous in the environment and it is a con-
troversial endocrine disruptor. Its degradation using the heterogeneous photo-Fenton with
the Fe-Y catalyst system was demonstrated by Jiang et al. (2014) .
Phenolic compounds (vanillin, protocatechuic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, gallic
acid, and l-tyrosine) are present in high concentrations in various types of agro-industrial
wastes. As these are highly biorecalcitrant, the possibility of treatment by photo-Fenton
reaction under artificial light in laboratory experiments and in pilot-plant experiments
under sunlight has been investigated by Gernjak et al. (2003) (Table 3.7 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT3.8 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
In order to increase the enzymatic digestibility of rice straw for saccharification,
Fenton’s reagent, ultrasound, and the combination of Fenton’s reagent and ultrasound
were used by Xiong et al. (2017) . It was revealed that the rice straw pretreated by
ultrasound-assisted Fenton’s reagent exhibited the largest specific surface area and the
lowest degree of polymerization value.
The expedient degradation of rhodamine B, acid red G, and metronidazole by the iron
sludge-graphene catalyst was reported by Guo e al. (2017) , in which iron sludge existed as
FeOOH particles that were mainly entrapped inside the graphene sheet. This catalyst
exhibited wide pH operating range, excellent stability, and reusability. It was concluded
that the mesoporous structure increases the adsorption ability and the promoted the Fe31/
Fe21cycle. Trapido et al. (2017) employed aerobic biological treatment (BIO) combined
with the Fenton process. This elaborated BIO-Fenton-BIO approach was reported to be
cost-effective for the total organic load reduction and for the selected specific pollutants
removal.
Degradation of various pollutants have been reported in recent years ( Table 3.8 ).
Lonfat et al. (2016) reported the application of the Fe-citrate-based photo-Fenton process
for the inactivation of E. coli and obtained promising results of bacterial inactivation at
near-neutral and alkaline pH conditions using very low iron concentration and avoiding
precipitation of ferric hydroxides. The effects of the solution pH and Fe-citrate complex
concentration on E. coli inactivation were also observed. The efficiency of the homoge-
neous photo-Fenton process using Fe-citrate complex (as a source of iron) enhanced bacte-
rial inactivation as compared with the heterogeneous photo-Fenton treatment using FeSO 4
and goethite as sources of iron, at near-neutral pH. It was observed that the bacterial inac-
tivation rate increased in the order:
Goethite ,FeSO 4,Fe-citrate
Encouraging results were also obtained, when this treatment was tried for
bacterial inactivation in natural water samples from Lake Geneva (Switzerland) at
pH 8.5. No bacterial reactivation and/or growth were observed after the photo-Fenton
treatment ( Fig. 3.6 ).
It can be concluded that the different types of Fenton and photo-Fenton processes are
highly efficient, less tedious, and act as an eco-friendly technique with the capability of
degrading a wide spectrum of organic pollutants. In the last few decades, various
attempts have been made to achieve a high rate of decomposition and mineralization of
recalcitrant complex organic compounds at neutral pH, and minimize the sludge produc-
tion. Various improvements have been suggested and incorporated in order to achieve
low operation cost. Exploitation of solar energy in order to accomplish the expedient deg-
radation of various pollutants will fulfill the need of today and years to come. This field
opens the avenue for new researches in which cost reduction, less energy consumption,
and practical applicability of these processes at larger scale and natural conditions could
be aimed.74 3. FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON PROCESSES

4.1 INTRODUCTION
The industrial and urban wastewaters contain a great variety of pollutants such as
nutrients, heavy metals, salts, pathogens, soluble, and particulate organic matter ( Howe
et al., 2012; Tchobanoglous et al., 2003 ). Over the years, different phenomena such as
economic development, changes in land use, improvement of life standards, changes in
agricultural practices, population growth, and urbanization have significantly changed the
characteristics of wastewaters ( Grandcle ´ment et al., 2017 ).
The conventional treatment of wastewaters focuses on the abatement of organic matter,
nutrients, and other compounds through the combination of mechanical, biological, physical,
and chemical operations. The use of a biological treatment is essential for the elimination of
solubilized organic matter, producing decontamination through the metabolic action of
microorganisms ( Malato et al., 2002 ). While this chain of operations is appropriate for most
wastewaters of domestic origin, treating industrial effluents is usually more complicated due
to their high load of organic matter, salinity, non-neutral pHs, color, or the presence of syn-
thetic chemical compounds with high persistence and low biodegradability. These com-
pounds can frequently bring about more stable and toxic species through the biotic and
abiotic transformations that normally take place in wastewater treatment plants or pass
unchanged through the process and exert their toxicity on the aquatic biocoenosis ( Binelli
et al., 2015 ). As a consequence, specific technological options need to be implemented aimed
at eliminating chemical compounds that are difficult to remove by the application of conven-
tional treatments, or decreasing the overall pollution levels of the effluent.
Essentially, the recalcitrant character of an effluent can be determined by the presence
of one or several compounds whose properties are directly related to the processes that
produced such effluent as waste. Often, these compounds exhibit xenophore substituents

sequences, or an excessive molecular size ( Iba´n˜ez et al., 2007 ). Examples of such com-
pounds can be pesticides, fertilizers, pigments and dyes, chemical precursors, etc. In
numerous cases, treatability problems are caused by the presence of micropollutants,
which include substances such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, steroid hor-
mones, and other emerging compounds ( Luo et al., 2014; Martı ´nez-Alcala ´et al., 2017 ).
A great variety of recalcitrant compounds and their concurrence with other pollutants
calls for tailoring specific treatment processes to the particularities of the effluents. Thus, a
significant number of treatment options have been reported to date as effective in the deg-
radation of pollutants through physicochemical pathways. While the application of a spe-
cific technique will be a function of the effluent’s composition as well as other variables
(e.g., operation conditions, costs, space, environmental legislation), the best-known options
are based on the chemical oxidation of the recalcitrant compounds.
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are a group of techniques that rely on the use of
radicals to destroy complex organic compounds into simpler end products. The logic
behind these processes is to reduce the recalcitrant character of an effluent to a point that
it can be passed on to conventional wastewater treatment processes. The use of AOPs has
been widely supported over the past two decades, mainly because of the non-selective
character of the degradation processes of organic and inorganic species, as well as micro-
organisms ( Giannakis et al., 2016a,b ). Most of these processes rely on the formation of
hydroxyl radicals (OH), which are considered the most powerful oxidizing agents in
aqueous phase ( E/C14: 2.8 V/SHE, Standard Hydrogen Electrode). Moreover, hydroxyl radi-
cals exhibit higher reaction rates than other conventional oxidizing agents such as KMnO 4,
Cl2,O2,O3,or hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2)(Bautista et al., 2008 ).
There are several technical alternatives available for the generation of hydroxyl radicals,
such as electrochemical processes ( Zhou et al., 2005 ), sonochemical processes
(Mantzavinos et al., 2004 ), through the exposure to artificial or natural radiation ( Bremner
et al., 2006; Esplugas et al., 2002 ), through homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis
(Esplugas et al., 2005; Lelario et al., 2016; Martı ´nez et al., 2005 ), and in acid or basic condi-
tions ( Kavitha and Palanivelu, 2004; Neyens and Baeyens, 2003 ). Within the overall chain
of treatments in a wastewater treatment facility, the use of AOPs can be found upstream
and downstream a conventional biological process, depending on whether the biodegrad-
ability of an effluent needs to be conditioned or to clean it before discharge to any receiving
water bodies ( Blanco and Malato, 2003 ).
4.2 THE FENTON AND PHOTO-FENTON REACTIONS
The Fenton reaction was described for the first time by Fenton, who observed the oxida-
tion of tartaric acid by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ferrous ions ( Fenton, 1894 ).
However, it was not until the decade of 1960, when the Fenton reaction was first applied
to the destruction of hazardous organic compounds ( Barbu ´sinski, 2009; Neyens and
Baeyens, 2003 ). The combination of iron (Fe21) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) generates
hydroxyl radicals (OH, HO/C15
2) through Eqs. 4.1 /C04.2(Pignatello et al., 2006 ).90 4. FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED PROCESSES

Since the reaction of H 2O2with Fe31is significantly slower as compared to Fe21, the
catalyst regeneration phase is considered the most critical stage of the process as it reduces
the radical production rate and could end up depleting the iron available for the reaction
(Eqs. 4.3 /C04.4)(Malato et al., 2009 ).

The Fenton reaction requires a specific set of conditions to achieve maximal reduction of
organic matter. In this respect, the efficiency of the process is determined by factors such as
temperature, pH, as well as hydrogen peroxide, and iron concentrations. In the case of pH,
the chemistry of iron requires that the Fenton reaction must be carried out in acidic condi-
tions (pH 53/C04) to avoid its precipitation as hydroxide. The reaction presents its maximum
catalytic activity at pH 2.8 /C03.0, after which its efficiency decreases due to the precipitation
of iron as Fe(OH) 3and the degradation of H 2O2into O 2and H 2O, respectively ( Barbu ´sinski,
2009; Pignatello et al., 2006 ). Regarding the temperature of the reaction, higher temperatures
result in increased rates; however, it may also result in an increased decomposition of H 2O2
into O 2and H 2O. H 2O2, being a costly reagent to generate or supply, its thermal decomposi-
tion generally results in reaction temperatures being close to room temperature.
The dosage of reagents (H 2O2and Fe21) is perhaps the most important consideration in
the design of the treatment process, as it will not only condition the overall efficiency of the
process but its cost also. The concentration of H 2O2that must be supplied for the adequate
degradation of pollutants is a function of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the effluent
(Pignatello et al., 2006 ). Similarly, increasing the concentration of Fe21leads to higher reac-
tion rates until it reaches a certain concentration above which all rate increases appear to be
marginal ( Rivas et al., 2001 ). Furthermore, an enormous increase in the concentration of
Fe21may contribute to higher concentrations of total dissolved solids, which may be prob-
lematic for further treatment steps or discharge ( Babuponnusami and Muthukumar, 2014 ).
It is generally recommended that an optimal dose of reagents is tailored to meet the desired
removal of pollutants for a specific effluent using experimental trials and mathematical opti-
mization techniques ( Bautista et al., 2008; Szpyrkowicz et al., 2001; Vedrenne et al., 2012a,b ).
Under normal conditions (the “dark Fenton”), an accumulation of Fe31and its complexa-
tion with carboxylate species from the degradation of organic matter generally reduces the
degradation rates of the Fenton reaction ( Pignatello et al., 2006 ). However, its rate can be
substantially increased in the presence of radiation (UV, visible) due to the photochemical
properties of the iron (Fe31) complexes that undergo a ligand-to-metal charge transfer exci-
tation, and the formation of complexes with diverse carboxylates and polycarboxylates that
exhibit photoactive properties as in Eqs. 4.5 /C04.6(Malato et al., 2009; Pignatello et al., 2006 ):

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe Fenton reaction has several advantages compared to other AOPs. First of all, iron
and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) are abundant and safe from an environmental point of
view, if optimally dosed. Furthermore, the process follows relatively simple operating
principles and the absence of mass transfer limitations ( Mirzaei et al., 2017 ). In the case of
the photo-Fenton reaction, the exposure to sunlight is one of the main advantages as it
avoids the use of UV lamps, with associated energy consumptions and potential hazards.
It also drastically reduces iron sludge waste and enhances the decomposition of H 2O2
(Bokare and Choi, 2014 ).
Even though the Fenton and the photo-Fenton reactions have proved to be effective in
the removal of complex organic matter, the treatment exhibits a number of drawbacks,
which have limited its upscaling beyond pilot plant ( Garcia-Segura et al., 2016; Spasiano
et al., 2015 ). The acidic conditions that need to be kept to avoid the precipitation of iron
and its further reconditioning before other treatments downstream require the use of acidi-
fying and alkalinizing agents, which necessarily increase the cost of the treatment.
Additional difficulties can arise due to corrosion of steel equipment. In consequence, sub-
stantial research has been carried out to allow achieving similar efficiency levels in neutral
or circumneutral conditions ( Carra et al., 2014 ).
In this context, the use of organic acids has been described as an effective way for avoid-
ing acid pHs, since these form complexes with iron, which are more soluble as acidity
decreases. Examples of organic ligands used to enhance the Fenton reaction are oxalic acid,
citric acid, and oxalic acid, which allow for forming strong, stable, and soluble complexes
with iron, avoiding the sequestration of the catalyst by other organic and inorganic com-
pounds in the effluent. Moreover, these complexes have a much higher quantum yield than
ferric iron-water complexes and can use a higher fraction of the solar radiation spectrum
(580 nm) ( Manenti et al., 2015; Prato-Garcı ´a et al., 2009; Prato-Garcı ´aa n dB u i t r o ´n, 2011 ).
Here, an alternative to the traditional Fenton/photo-Fenton process for the oxidation of
organic matter using ferrioxalate complexes enters the scene.
4.3 THE FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED FENTON REACTION
4.3.1 Influence of pH
The pH of a residual effluent is a critical parameter that conditions the overall performance
of the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes because it controls the catalyst’s speciation and
determines the occurrence of undesirable parallel reactions forming less-oxidant radicals
(Prato-Garcı ´aa n dB u i t r o ´n, 2012; Pouran et al., 2015 ). At acidic conditions (pH 51.0/C02.5), it
has been observed thatOH radicals are consumed by protons (H1)(Eq. 4.7 ).
/C15OH1H11e2-H2O (4.7)
It is worth mentioning that the predominant form of the catalyst [Fe(H 2O)6]31reacts
slowly with the oxidant reducing the efficiency of the process even more. When the reac-
tion medium is highly acidic (pH ,1.0), the production rate of theOH radicals is limited
due to the electrophilic character of H 3O21ions formed from H 2O2(Mirzaei et al., 2017 ).92 4. FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTAt an alkaline pH (7.0 /C014.0), the hydrolysis-precipitation processes, and the presence of
parallel reactions severely limit the availability of the catalyst for the generation ofOH
radicals. In addition, the self-decomposition of H 2O2further decreases the efficiency of the
process ( Eq. 4.8 ). Proof of this influence is the fact that an increase in pH from 0 to 14
reduces the oxidation potential ofOH radicals from 2.59 V to 1.64 V.
2H2O2-2H2O1O2 (4.8)
Iron is highly soluble in an aqueous phase in the pH range between 3.0 and 4.0, as it is
being presented as species such as Fe21or [Fe H 2OðÞ21
6]. In the absence of complexing
agents and in acidic conditions, [Fe H 2OðÞ21
6] hydrolyzes into Fe(H 2O)5(OH)1and Fe
(H2O)4(OH) 3(or FeOH1and Fe(OH) 2, respectively). This last species is crucial in Fenton
processes because it is significantly more reactive than Fe21. Although an acidic pH facili-
tates the generation ofOH radicals, the observed reaction rate constants for the regenera-
tion of the catalyst through the consumption of oxidants ( Eq. 4.2 ) or through the
photocatalytic pathway ( Eq. 4.6 ) are relatively low. This provokes the accumulation of
Fe31in the reaction medium as well as reduction in the degradation rate of pollutants. It
is important to remember that in the absence of reagents, the photoreduction of the cata-
lyst is responsible for the production of aqueousOH radicals. The quantum yield for the
production of Fe21through Eq. 4.2 depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation;
in general, such a yield shows a decrease inversely proportion to the wavelength of radia-
tion, e.g., the quantum yield of Eq. 4.6 is reported to be within the range 0.13 /C00.19 at
313 nm and 0.017 at 360 nm. This in turn translates directly in an important reduction of
the catalyst regeneration speed. It should be highlighted that in many cases, such a reac-
tion does not play an important role unless Fe21can be quickly oxidized by any other spe-
cies present in the medium (O 2,H O 2,H2O2)(Pignatello et al., 2006 ).
4.3.2 Iron Complexes with Organic and Inorganic Substances
Perhaps one of the most notable characteristics of Fe31is its ability to form complexes
with organic and inorganic substances. In the absence of solar radiation, Fe31and Fe21
form stable complexes with chloride and sulfate ions ( Eqs. 4.9 /C04.13), which hinder catalyst
regeneration ( Devi et al., 2013; Grebel et al., 2010; Machulek et al., 2007; Mico ´et al., 2013 ).

When the process occurs at an acidic pH ( ,3.5) in the presence of solar radiation, an
adverse effect is caused by the presence of chloride and sulfate ions, which photoreduces
Fe31and generates additional oxidant radicals such as Cl(E/C1452.41 V vs NHE)
(Eqs. 4.14 /C04.15)(De Laat et al., 2004 ).93 4.3 THE FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED FENTON REACTION

On the other hand, the carboxylate-Fe31and polycarboxylate-Fe31present greater molar
absorption coefficients and allowed the use of wavelengths of the visible spectrum for
catalyst regeneration. The formation of this type of complexes is interesting as it makes
operating at circumneutral conditions possible (pH 55.5/C07.5), increasesOH radicals pro-
duction rate, the regeneration of the iron catalyst, and the formation of additional radicals
such as CO/C152
2(E/C1451.90 V vs NHE) ( Eqs. 4.16 /C04.19).

In recent years, a wide range of organic and inorganic substances capable of forming
complexes with Fe31have been reported. The efficiency of the chelating agent depends on
its concentration, the type of pollutant present in the effluent, the pH of operation and the
iron-to-chelating agent ratio. Any iron-chelating agent system should present characteris-
tics such as low cost, high catalytic activity toward the pollutant of interest,
environmentally-friendly, and high quantum yield. Additionally, it should be resistant to
oxidation and capable of generating additional chemical species that increase the oxidative
capacity of the reaction medium ( Jeong and Yoon, 2004; Sun and Pignatello, 1992 ).
Some of the byproducts generated during the treatment of aromatic compounds with
the Fenton reaction generate agents that catalyze the destruction of the organic matter due
to their oxidation-reduction potential ( Eq. 4.19 ). Additionally, substances such as quinone-
hydroquinone undergo alternative pathways for the regeneration of the catalyst
(Eqs. 4.20 /C04.21), which allows overcoming, albeit transitorily, the iron regeneration bottle-
neck ( Eq. 4.2 ). Finally, the continuous hydroxylation of organic substances originates sim-
pler compounds such as organic acids, which in turn form very stable iron complexes that
impede catalyst regeneration. This condition and the reduction of the concentration of
H2O2explain the decrease in the oxidative capacity of the Fenton processes.

4.3.3 Reaction Mechanisms
The iron complexes with carboxylates and polycarboxylates have increased molar
absorption coefficients in the near UV (300 /C0400 nm) and visible spectra ( Xiao et al., 2014 ).
The possibility of operating in conditions close to neutrality and a higher quantum yield
make these species an interesting alternative for improving the performance of94 4. FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTconventional Fenton processes. The specific quantum yield of the complexes will be
defined by variables such as pH and the ratio of iron-to-oxalate ( Abrahamson et al., 1994;
Wang et al., 2014 ). When the iron-to-oxalate ratio is 1, Fe(C 2O4)1is the dominant species,
but at higher concentration, oxalate produces species such as Fe C 2O4 ðÞ2
2and Fe C 2O4 ðÞ32
3,
which are more photoactive than Fe(C 2O4)1and FeOH21(Wang et al., 2014 ).
Although the advantages of using organic complexes of iron to intensify the Fenton
reaction are evident, the reaction mechanisms and the intermediate products remain con-
troversial. In general, the photolysis of complexes leads to the oxidation of ligands and the
reduction of the catalyst to Fe21. The degradation products of the complexes are key as
they generate additional reactive species (HO/C15
2,O/C152
2,/C15OH, CO/C152
2,C2O/C152
4) and originate the
required oxidant. Pignatello et al. (2006) have identified that under high concentrations of
Fe31, the oxalyl radical (C 2O/C152
4) decomposes itself into carbon dioxide and carboxylate
radicals (CO/C152
2), which are transformed into superoxide radicals (O/C152
2) in the presence of
oxygen ( Eq. 4.22 ). On the other hand, at high concentrations of Fe31, the oxalyl radical
reduces the catalyst to Fe21.

The majority of scientists defend two models of the likely reaction pathways of ferrioxa-
late complexes ( Pozdnyakov et al., 2008 ). In the first model, the complex becomes dis-
solved after its excitation without any electron transfer occurring between the ligand and
the metal ( Eq. 4.23 ). The second model considers a process of charge transfer between the
ligand and the catalyst ( Eq. 4.24 ). In each case, the destruction of the pollutant is favored
due to the photoreduction of the catalyst and the formation of additional oxidizing and
reducing agents.

4.3.4 Optimization
The cost of the Fenton reagent (Fe21,H 2O2) and the most common reactor designs are
thought to pose the greatest limitations on the use of the process at an industrial scale.
Additionally, the acidification and neutralization stages further increase the operating
costs and have the associated risk of the formation of sludge due to the catalyst precipita-
tion. Therefore, the majority of the processes are to be optimized in respect to the use of
reagents and operating conditions close to neutrality. The operating factors examined for
an optimal use of the process are the type of organic ligand, the iron-to-ligand, ratio the
oxidation state of the catalyst (Fe31or Fe21), the dose of Fenton reagent, temperature, radi-
ation source (solar radiation vs lamps), and accumulated energy in the reactor ( Table 4.1 ).
Due to technical and economic considerations, the preferred optimization approach for
the selection of the best operative conditions in Fenton and photo-Fenton processes has
changed in the last two decades ( Callao, 2014; Sakkas et al., 2010 ). The study of individual
variables (e.g., pH, temperature, H 2O2, Fe, etc.) is a relatively simple task from an95 4.3 THE FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED FENTON REACTION

tic effects that may occur during the treatment process. The use of this type of strategies
usually results in selecting extreme operative conditions (an excess of oxidant, catalyst,
ligand, and accumulated energy) that favor undesirable parallel reactions ( Eqs. 4.25 /C04.27)
and reduce the technical feasibility and economic attractiveness of the process ( Prato-
Garcı ´a and Buitro ´n, 2012 ).

In general, an increase in the concentration of organic ligands has a positive effect on
the efficiency of the process since it facilitates the regeneration of the catalyst. In some
other cases, an increase in the concentration of ligand does not increase the degradation
rate; this may be related with the specific characteristics of the substance that is being sub-
jected to treatment and the applied experimental strategy ( Salem et al., 2009 ). An excess of
ligand increases the absorbance of the solution, which in turn reduces the number of
photons that are available in the reaction medium for catalyst regeneration. Similarly, the
excess of ligand delays the decomposition of the transient species generated after the
photolysis of the iron-ligand compounds. This explains the negative effect in treatment
efficiency that has been reported in the decoloring of azo dyes ( Dong et al., 2008; Selvam
et al., 2005 ). The use of elevated doses of ligand, catalyst, and oxidant have been associated
with high organic loads or to the treatment of pigmented effluents. This operative restric-
tion could derive in a high consumption of reagents and radicals for the generation of spe-
cies with a lower oxidizing power. Recently, the use of dosing strategies for reagents has
been promoted as an alternative to reduce the occurrence of undesirable reactions, allow-
ing a better consumption of reagents ( Doumic et al., 2015; Prato-Garcı ´a and Buitro ´n, 2012 ).
The use of chemometric techniques allows exploring in a rigorous way the incidence of
the operating variables in the efficiency of the process ( Schenone et al., 2015 ). The first
stage of the experimental strategy usually involves the study of variables through factorial,
fractioned factorial, and Placket-Burman designs with the objective of reducing the num-
ber of experiments ( Callao, 2014; Myers et al., 2009; Sakkas et al., 2010 ). When the amount
of factors increases, the use of a fractioned factorial design allows a lower number of
experimental executions and has as an additional advantage of the fact that the least rele-
vant factors are not considered (e.g., interactions between three or more factors). The
Plackett /C0Burman design is an attractive alternative, when the objective is to determine the
variables of interest. This type of design is oriented to the study of the principal effects
and does not consider the interactions of two factors, some of which are essential in AOPs
such as the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes ( Callao, 2014 ). A central composite design
requires a low number of executions and it is adequate in the construction of second-order
response surfaces. The number of experiments ( N) can be determined from Eq. 4.28
(Myers et al., 2009 ).

able, and the number of experiments can be estimated from Eq. (4.29) ; its main advantage
is that it avoids the use of extreme operative conditions ( Callao, 2014 ). This in turn, will
reduce the problems associated with undesirable reactions.

It should be mentioned that the use of response surfaces allows localizing the operative
optimal and the nature of the stationary point ( Sakkas et al., 2010 ). The desirability func-
tion ( D) shown in Eq. (4.30) , allows achieving a specific objective through a weight-
adjustment process using the factors under study (e.g., oxidant concentration, catalyst,
ligand, etc.). In Fenton and photo-Fenton processes, the objectives are variable: decoloring,
mineralization, or removal of an active compound, while the most common restrictions
were associated to the reduction in the consumption of reagents ( Monteagudo et al., 2010 ).

This strategy has been particularly useful for determining a series of optimal conditions
for the various applications of the Fenton reaction, achieving reductions in the consump-
tion of reagents within the range between 50% and 70%. The experimental strategy
evidences the capacity to detoxify effluents with a fraction of the reagents theoretically
required.

compounds present in lignocellulosic prehydrolyzates prior to the fermentation in the pro-
duction of biofuels ( Vedrenne et al., 2015 ) as well as in several disinfection applications
(Giannakis et al., 2016a,b; Ndounla et al., 2014; Polo-Lo ´pez et al., 2012 ).
Although not as vast as in the case of the ordinary photo-Fenton, numerous studies
have described the application of the photo-Fenton reaction mediated with ferrioxalate
complexes to different types of wastewaters. The applications of the ferrioxalate-assisted100 4. FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTphoto-Fenton process for the treatment of wastewaters from the textile, pesticides, phar-
maceutical, chemical, and petroleum industries, or the treatment and disinfection of efflu-
ents have been described briefly.
4.4.1 Textile Industry
Several studies are available dealing with the degradation of dyes and pigments from the
textile industries with ferrioxalate-mediated photo-Fenton processes. Arslan et al. (2000)
described the degradation of a mixture of various aminochlorotriazine reactive dyes
(Procion Blue HERD, Procion crimson HEXL, Procion yellow HE4R, Procion navy HEXL,
and Procion yellow HEXL), along with several conditioning, anti-creasing, and sequestering
agents. Under full photo-Fenton conditions, the effluent becomes free of total organic carbon
(TOC) after 20 min of treatment ( Table 4.2 ). The study was carried out at an acidic pH so as
to recognize the need of further spending resources to bring it to neutrality for release.
Monteagudo et al. (2009) investigated the efficiency of the ferrioxalate photo-Fenton sys-
tem in the detoxification of a simulated effluent carrying Orange II (20 mg/L). The
selected operative conditions of the treatment allowed a 100% decolorization, along with a
95% removal of TOC using continuous addition of H 2O2. When H 2O2was added at the
beginning of the treatment, TOC removal was 80%. Monteagudo et al. (2010) also assessed
the photodegradation of reactive blue 4 solutions using the ferrioxalate systems with con-
tinuous addition of H 2O2and air injection ( Table 4.2 ). Five levels of operative conditions
were assessed. Under the optimal conditions selected in this work; ([Fe21]54 ppm,
[C2O422]519 ppm, pH 52 and no air bubbling, initial dose of H 2O2), a 61% removal of
TOC was achieved. The efficiency of the system was increased to 82%, when the addition
of H 2O2was made continuously.
The degradation of methyl orange with ferrioxalate complexes was examined by Fadzil
et al. (2012) and Azami et al. (2012) using different operation conditions ( Table 4.2 ).Fadzil
et al. (2012) applied the process to simulated effluents with a concentration of 20 mg/L,
achieving a 67% decolorization after 90 min of treatment, while Azami et al. (2012) used
solutions with a concentration of 0.025 mM of dye and achieved between 92% and 100%
reduction of color after 65 min of treatment under acidic conditions ( Chakma et al., 2015 ).
Vedrenne et al. (2012a,b) focused on the treatment of Indigo, analyzing the degradation
of three different concentrations of dye (6.66, 16.67, and 33.33 mg/L, see Table 4.2 ). They
found that after 180 min of treatment, 73% of the TOC was removed from the effluent
using the lowest hydrogen peroxide dose (257 mg/L). It was also observed that after
20 kJ/L irradiation, the biodegradability of the effluent notably increased as confirmed by
the presence of short chain carboxylic acids as intermediate products and by the minerali-
zation of organic nitrogen into nitrate. The toxicity of the initial and resulting effluent was
assessed for brine shrimp ( Artemia salina ), showing an overall decrease.
Chakma et al. (2015) examined the degradation of methylene blue and acid red B with
an initial concentration of 20 ppm (0.063 mM) using a number of AOPs, including
ferrioxalate-mediated photo-Fenton reaction. They found that after 60 min of treatment,
the solution of acid red B was decolorized in 66% while the solution of methylene blue
was decolorized only 45% ( Table 4.2 ).101 4.4 APPLICATIONS

ferrioxalates for the degradation of a synthetic cotton-textile dyeing wastewater, which
consisted of a very complex mixture of chemicals. This mixture contained several dyes
(Procion yellow HEXL, Procion deep red HEXL gran), anti-oil and anti-crease agents,
enzymes, water correctors, bleaching agents, electrolytes, and detergents. Under the opera-
tive conditions, decolorization of approximately 100% was achieved after 4 kJ/L of irradia-
tion as well as a reduction of 77.7% in the total COD of the effluent ( Table 4.2 ).
The treatment of real textile wastewater was carried out by Manenti et al. (2015) using
different organic ligands for the complexation of iron. This treatment was carried out in
laboratory and pilot-plant scale reactors irradiated by artificial and natural solar radiation
using a wastewater sample collected from an industrial textile company located in the
north of Portugal. The textile effluent had an alkaline pH, a high content of organic matter
(COD51239 mg/L), and a moderate biodegradability. They observed that the treatment
using organic ligands (e.g., oxalates) enhanced the photo-Fenton reaction, avoiding the for-
mation of iron-organic pollutant complexes and increasing the overall catalytic activity.
The optimal conditions for the treatment of this effluent were [Fe31]5100 mgL and
pH52.8, which allowed achieving a 69% of mineralization after 8.8 kJ/L of radiation. The
main contribution of this study was the fact that it used samples from real wastewater
from a textile factory, and not simulated effluents as done by most of the workers.
4.4.2 Chemical Industry and Pesticides
The photo-Fenton reaction assisted with ferrioxalate complexes has been applied to
treat effluents from the chemical industry contaminated with different compounds. Prato-
Garcı ´a et al. (2009) focused on the treatment of phenolic wastewaters in two compound
parabolic collectors (CPC) under batch and closed flow conditions. Phenol transformation
efficiencies of 100% and total COD reduction percentages of 85% were achieved after 1 h
of treatment. The reagents were dosed following mass ratios of oxalate/phenol of 1.5, oxa-
late/Fe31of 15, and H 2O2/phenol greater than 5. The treatment was undertaken at pH
conditions close to neutrality.
Key operative considerations in the degradation of para-chlorophenol in wastewaters
was investigated in Kusic et al. (2011) . They evaluated the interactions between process
parameters applying experimental design techniques. The optimal conditions for the maxi-
mal degradation of para-chlorophenol are: pH 54.4, concentration of [Fe31]50.1 mM,
and [C 2O22
4]53.4 mM, when UV-C radiation was used. When the effluent is exposed to
UV-A radiation, the optimal operative conditions are pH 55.6, [Fe31]51.38 mM, and
[C2O22
4]58.16 mM.
Monteagudo et al. (2011) presented a study on the mineralization of a mixture of pheno-
lic compounds (gallic, p-coumaric, and protocatechuic acids) in wastewaters using the
photo-Fenton process with ferrioxalates using a pilot-plant scale CPC. An optimization
study was performed to investigate the influence of pH, temperature, solar power, air
flow, and dosage of H 2O2,F e21, and oxalic acid. The optimal conditions in these experi-
ments, allowed a complete removal of phenolic compounds and 94% removal of TOC after
5 and 194 min of treatment, respectively. The variables having a higher degree of influence103 4.4 APPLICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTin the efficiency of the treatment are pH and the initial concentrations of reagents. The
optimal conditions of this study were [H 2O2]5400 mg/L, [Fe21]520, [C 2O22
4]560,
and pH 54.
A novel application of the photo-Fenton reaction assisted with ferrioxalates for the deg-
radation of 4-nitrophenol was examined in Ayodele and Hameed (2013) , using solid-phase
catalysts (copper pillared bentonite). This treatment’s main advantage is that it avoids pH
adjustments. The optimal operation conditions found in this study were 20% excess of
H2O2, 2.0 of solid-phase catalyst, and a temperature of 40/C14C. A similar study by Ayodele
(2013) studied the effects of phosphoric acid treatment with the ferrioxalate-assisted
photo-Fenton reaction using kaolinite as a catalyst support. These two studies stress on
the benefits of the heterogeneous photo-Fenton in minimizing catalyst leaching.
Schenone et al. (2015) reported the application of the ferrioxalate photo-Fenton process
to the degradation of the herbicide dicholophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in natural conditions
(pH55). The influence of temperature and concentration ratios was also investigated
through the use of the response surface methodology. Under optimal conditions, the treat-
ment achieved degradation levels of 91.4% and 95.9% for low and high radiation condi-
tions. They echo the general understanding about photo-Fenton processes, whose
effectiveness are conditioned by the dose of hydrogen peroxide.
Estrada-Arriaga et al. (2016) studied the treatment of a real oil refinery effluent with high
concentrations of phenols through a combined ferrioxalate photo-Fenton and membrane
ultrafiltration. The effluent treated in this work had a concentration of 200 mg/L of phenols,
which was obtained directly from a petroleum refinery in Mexico. The highest removals of
COD (84%) and phenol (100%) were obtained with concentrations of 200 mg/L of oxalate,
20 mg/L, 500 mg/L of H 2O2,and a pH of 5 after 120 min of treatment. The ultrafiltration pro-
cess reduced COD to 22 mg/L, achieving a total removal of 94%.
4.4.3 Pharmaceutical Industry
The ferrioxalate-mediated photo-Fenton reaction has also been applied in numerous
studies in the treatment of effluents from the pharmaceutical industries. These effluents
are characterized by the presence of compounds such as antibiotics, hormones, and endo-
crine disruptors, which have a direct detrimental effect on aquatic life.
The degradation of an effluent containing the antibiotic amoxicillin with ferrioxalate
photo-Fenton as well as its toxicity was observed by Trovo ´et al. (2011) before and after
treatment. The degradation of the antibiotic was carried out in the presence of a potassium
ferrioxalate complex that proved to be more effective than the sole addition of FeSO 4. The
study identified the presence of sixteen intermediate compounds that originate during
the degradation of the antibiotic: Toxicity to Daphnia magna was observed throughout the
treatment, which was associated to the presence of intermediates and oxalate. The toxicity
of the effluent was reduced to 45% after 240 min of irradiation. At the end of the treat-
ment, the presence of short chain (and biodegradable) carboxylic acids was widely
observed. They investigated the efficiency of several treatments in the degradation of an
effluent containing the analgesic paracetamol, in which the ferrioxalate-mediated system
exhibited a worse performance compared to the use of FeSO 4only ( Trovo ´et al., 2012 ).104 4. FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThis treatment was applied by Pereira et al. (2014) to the decontamination of a wastewa-
ter containing the antibiotic oxytetracycline. It was observed that the addition of oxalates
and citrates avoided the formation of an oxytetracycline-iron complex, which was lost in
filtering operations. The treatment was carried out in a CPC pilot-scale plant using an
iron/oxalate molar ratio of 1:3 with an initial [Fe21] of 2 mg/L and pH 5. These conditions
allowed a removal of the dissolved organic carbon of approximately 51%, accompanied by
the presence of short chain carboxylic acids.
Souza et al. (2014) tested the application of the photo-Fenton reaction with ferrioxalates
for the removal of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac in water. The degra-
dation of this drug in the aqueous solution is very slow due to precipitation-redissolution
mechanisms and therefore, the use of ferrioxalate complexes has an advantage since it
avoids precipitation. This study evaluated three different iron/oxalate molar ratios (1:3,
1:6, and 1:9, with an initial [Fe31] of 2 mg/L under natural conditions (pH 55/C06) and arti-
ficial radiation. The 1:9 ratio achieved a complete degradation of diclofenac and 63% min-
eralization in 90 min at pH 56. The 1:3 ratio achieved comparable reductions but at the
slightly acidic pH of 5. These last operative conditions are deemed the most suitable due
to the reagent economy.
Dias et al. (2014) studied the degradation of the antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfameth-
oxazole in aqueous solutions by the application of the photo-Fenton reaction enhanced
with ferrioxalate complexes. The addition of ferrioxalates showed down the complexation
of iron by organic compounds originated in the decomposition of the antibiotics. The efflu-
ents treated were successfully detoxified using a low iron concentration (5 mg/L) achiev-
ing a total disappearance of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole on 2.00 kJL and 1.25 kJ/L
of radiation, respectively.
Davididou et al. (2017) reported that the degradation of the analgesic antipyrine using
the ferrioxalate-intensified photo-Fenton reaction was triggered by artificial radiation
using a laboratory-scale reactor. The optimization of the dose of reagents was carried out
using artificial neural networks. The conditions were [H 2O2]5100 mg/L, [Fe21]520 mg/
L, [H 2C2O4]5100 mg/L, and pH 52.8, which allowed the complete degradation of antipy-
rine and 90% of TOC.
4.4.4 Food and Beverage Industry
The ferrioxalate-mediated photo-Fenton reaction has also been applied for the treatment
of winery wastewaters by Monteagudo et al. (2012) . This study reported the mineralization
of wastewater from an actual winery using a pilot plant CPC along with a physicochemi-
cal pre-treatment consisting of coagulation-flocculation. The operating conditions were
optimized through the application of a multivariate experimental design and neuronal net-
works. The resulting optimal conditions were [H 2O2]5260 mg/L (supplied in two doses),
[H2C2O4]580 mg/L, pH 53.5, [Fe21]530 mg/L achieving an overall reduction of 61% in
the TOC contents. Numerous papers have been focused on the degradation of the winery
wastewaters, but ( Ioannou et al., 2015 ) the application of ferrioxalate-mediated photo-
Fenton process is one of the few studies on winery wastewater.105 4.4 APPLICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT4.4.5 Water Disinfection
The use of ferrioxalates in water disinfection using the photo-Fenton reaction has been
limited, mostly due to the fact that it requires the addition of compounds that are not nor-
mally found in water and may exhibit toxic effects. However, the ferrioxalate-mediated
photo-Fenton reaction has been used in the disinfection of waters with microorganisms by
Cho et al. (2004) and Cho and Yoon (2008) .Cho et al. (2004) demonstrated that although
the inactivation of Escherichia coli is possible with photo-ferrioxalates; of course, its action
is slower than that of conventional disinfectants. Cho and Yoon (2008) reported that the
use of ferrioxalates was between 104and 107fold more effective for the inactivation of
Cryptosporidium parvum than typical chemical disinfectants such as ozone, chlorine dioxide,
and free chlorine. The photo-Fenton reaction has also been tested with other organic
ligands (e.g., citrate) in the bacterial inactivation of E. coli (Ruales-Lonfat et al., 2016 ).
4.5 FUTURE TRENDS
The application of the photo-Fenton reaction enhanced with ferrioxalates to the treat-
ment of effluents from various origins had been a subject of intense study. The process is
well characterized, as its kinetics and critical variables are understood. Most of this under-
standing stems from the fact that it is a variation of the traditional photo-Fenton process,
which has already been studied much more. Despite the fact that the photo-Fenton (and
ferrioxalate-mediated photo-Fenton) can be applied to virtually any effluent contaminated
with organic matter, there are still several gaps that need to be addressed.
The majority of the studies to date about the application of the photo-Fenton system
with ferrioxalates have used simulated effluents. While the use of simulated effluents is
necessary at the very first stages of experimentation to understand the performance of the
treatment under controlled conditions, the application of those findings cannot be immedi-
ately extrapolated to a real industrial wastewater ( Bili´nska et al., 2016 ). Real wastewaters
are characterized by the presence of many concomitant compounds used in different unit
operations of the industrial process. Moreover, the composition of wastewaters is site spe-
cific and has a variable character depending on the operation patterns of the industrial
facility. Therefore, the effectiveness of the photo-Fenton treatment with ferrioxalates
should be investigated with real wastewaters as much as possible, taking into consider-
ation the findings and lessons learned during the treatment of simulated effluents. Further
knowledge is required identifying variations in the effectiveness of treatment due to the
presence of concomitant compounds and to quantify their degree of influence. In this
respect, Klamerth et al. (2013) andManenti et al. (2015) have already investigated the treat-
ment’s efficiency with real wastewaters. Following the same logic, other studies have
investigated native compounds in the effluent that can act as performance enhancers, for
example, in the formation of organic complexes ( Papoutsakis et al., 2016 ).
The influence of the upscaling of the ferrioxalate-mediated photo-Fenton reaction from
laboratory scale to pilot plant, pre-industrial and industrial scales still need to be properly
described. Most of the studies deal with the photo-ferrioxalate system at either laboratory
or pilot-plant scale and therefore, information about operational and material obstacles in106 4. FERRIOXALATE-MEDIATED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTthe upscaling process or the overall efficiency of the treatment are generally scarce.
Furthermore, greater emphasis on the role of the ferrioxalate-mediated system as a unitary
process in the greater chain of treatments within a wastewater treatment facility should be
made (e.g., either as a pre-treatment or as a final polishing), as opposed to its isolated
study. Presently, work is being done on comprehensively describing the role of AOPs in
general within the wider wastewater treatment processes, yet specific information for
ferrioxalate-mediated processes is yet to be developed ( Oller et al., 2011; Papaphilippou
et al., 2013 ).
On the same lines, the cost and benefits of implementing a ferrioxalate system still need
to be identified as compared to other AOPs or other treatments, particularly regarding the
use of oxalate as an additional reagent as well as its associated impacts (e.g., in terms of
its biodegradability or toxicity). So far, work has been carried out in the identification of
factors affecting operating costs for the photo-Fenton reaction and for combined treat-
ments with biological reactors ( Carra et al., 2013; Pe ´rez et al., 2013 ). Finally, efforts are still
to be made to characterize the process in terms of its environmental risks and general sus-
tainable character, usually through a life cycle assessment ( Gime ´nez et al., 2015 ).
The ferrioxalate-mediated photo-Fenton reaction is a variation of the basic photo-Fenton
reaction in the sense that the addition of oxalate complexes in the dissolved iron catalyst
allow this process to occur at less acidic conditions and to increase the photocatalytic pro-
duction of hydroxyl radicals and therefore, increasing its efficiency. As with the regular
photo-Fenton reaction, the ferrioxalate system also has the degradation of recalcitrant com-
pounds that result in a decreased biodegradability due to their complex chemical
structure.
The efficiency of the treatment is directly correlated with a number of operation vari-
ables such as the dose of reagents (iron catalyst, organic ligands, and hydrogen peroxide),
the pH of operation, the level of irradiation, and the presence of external influencing fac-
tors such as air or salinity. The findings of numerous studies examining the effectiveness
of the treatment in the detoxification of a number of effluents indicate that the most critical
ones are the dose of reagents, the ratios of peroxide to iron and oxalate to iron, the pH of
operation, and the type of radiation source. Although the complex composition of the
effluents calls for obtaining specific and optimal operation conditions for each type of
them, the interplay of these variables often conditions the efficiency of the process.
Although not as extensively described as the ordinary photo-Fenton reaction, the
process mediated with ferrioxalates has been applied to wastewaters with a wide range of
origins showing promising results such as effluents from the chemical, textile, pharmaceu-
tical, food and beverage industries. The process has also been used to disinfect waters for
human consumption although its use remains limited due to the toxicity of oxalates. The
majority of the studies published on the ferrioxalate-mediated photo-Fenton reaction use
simulated or synthetic wastewaters with laboratory and pilot-plant scale equipment. As a
consequence, further investigation is needed to fill current knowledge gaps concerning the
use of real wastewaters, the pre-industrial and industrial upscaling of treatments, the role
of the process as a treatment itself within a wider wastewater treatment facility, as well as
the costs and benefits of implementing it compared to more mature alternatives.107 4.5 FUTURE TRENDS

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Ozone (O 3) is a powerful oxidant that has been widely used in a number of industrial
processes, such as municipal and industrial wastewater treatment, drinking water disinfec-
tion, chemical synthesis, food and beverage, agriculture, air pollution control, medical and
dental applications ( Loeb, 2011; Loeb et al., 2012 ). Ozone, in particular, has been used for
more than 100 years in drinking water treatment in the United States and throughout the
world ( Loeb et al., 2012; Rakness, 2005; Thompson and Drago, 2015 ). Ozone treatment
(ozonation) has also been used in wastewater treatment for effluent disinfection, odor con-
trol, color removal, oxidation of inorganic and organic contaminants ( Rice, 1996; Robson
and Rice, 1991 ). Ozone-based treatment is particularly useful in advanced water reclama-
tion and potable reuse applications ( Gerrity et al., 2014; Gerrity and Snyder, 2011 ).
Ozone is an unstable gas that can be generated from gaseous oxygen molecules using
electrical energy, such as electric discharge and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. In water,
ozone undergoes a series of reactions to decompose into various oxidative species, includ-
ing hydroxyl radical (OH), which is an even stronger oxidant than the parent molecular
ozone. The powerful oxidative power of ozonation is partly owing to the generation of
hydroxyl radicals. There are several ways to enhance the generation of hydroxyl radicals
in ozone-based water and wastewater treatment, including the addition of hydrogen per-
oxide (H 2O2), UV irradiation, and metal catalysts ( Andreozzi et al., 1999; Beltra ´n, 2003 ).
These processes are collectively called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).
Ozonation and ozone-based AOPs are capable of oxidizing numerous organic com-
pounds in water and wastewater, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products
(Ikehata et al., 2006 ), solvents ( Hoigne ´and Bader, 1983 ), pesticides ( Ikehata and Gamal El-
Din, 2005a, 2005b ), and surfactants ( Ikehata and Gamal El-Din, 2004 ). Here, the basics of
ozonation and ozone-based AOPs in wastewater treatment, such as different ozone reac-
tions, including direct and indirect reactions, byproduct formation, and other

research in wastewater treatment and several notable ozone wastewater treatment and
water reuse projects in the United States.
5.2 OZONE-BASED AOPs
Ozone is a highly reactive gas with a limited solubility in water. Therefore, the ozone
reactions are highly complicated in the aqueous system, which involves gas-liquid mass
transfer, self-decomposition, reactions with dissolved and suspended inorganic and
organic constituents. Once dissolved in water, ozone acts as an oxidant owing to its high
standard redox potential ( E0) of 2.07 V ( Beltra ´n, 2003 ). Ozone reacts with dissolved inor-
ganic and organic constituents in different pathways, namely molecular ozone (direct) and
hydroxyl radical (indirect). It is well known that the direct reactions are more selective
than the indirect reactions. These two groups of reactions are briefly summarized here.
More comprehensive explanation of these ozone reactions in water and wastewater treat-
ment has been discussed by Beltra ´n (2003) .
Owing to its unique chemical structure that involves four possible resonance forms
with three oxygen atoms, ozone possesses both electrophilic and nucleophilic characters.
According to Beltra ´n (2003) , the aqueous molecular ozone reactions can be classified into
three categories:
oxidation /C0reduction reactions
dipolar cycloaddition reactions
electrophilic substitution reactions
Due to its high redox potential, ozone has a capacity to oxidize numerous compounds,
such as iron, manganese, nitrite, sulfides, and bromide, via the oxidation /C0reduction reac-
tions. In many cases, the ozone oxidation reactions can be described as oxygen transfer
from ozone to the reactant. The main half-reactions of ozone in water are:
O312H112e2-O21H2O (5.1)
O31H2O1e2-O212OH2E051:24V/C0/C1
(5.2)
Ozone is known to attack C 5C double bonds in organic molecules such as olefins and
aromatics to form a cyclic intermediate called ozonide, which subsequently undergoes a
series of reactions such as abnormal ozonolysis and produces two smaller molecules such
as ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. In electrophilic substitution reactions, an ozone
molecule reacts with an organic molecule, such as a substituted aromatic compound, at
one of the nucleophilic positions. Ortho- and para-hydroxylation of aromatic compounds
such as phenol is a typical example of electrophilic substitution reactions. Hydroxylated
phenols are further decomposed by ozone into smaller organic acids, ketones, and alde-
hydes via a series of reactions, including abnormal ozonolysis.
In addition to these direct ozone reactions that involve ozone molecules and other com-
pounds (contaminants in the case of water and wastewater treatment), ozone molecules
decompose into various reactive oxygen species (i.e., free radicals) that react with the116 5. OZONE-BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcontaminants in water. This is called indirect reactions, or hydroxyl radical pathway,
because the main reactive species in an indirect reaction is hydroxyl radical. Hydroxyl
radicals are generated by a series of radical chain reactions, which involve initiation, prop-
agation, and termination reactions. There are two main initiation reactions depending on
the pH:
Acidic to neutral pH:
O31OH2-HO/C15
21O/C152
2 ki1570 M =s (5.3)
Alkaline pH:

O31HO2
2-HO/C15
21O/C152
3 ki352:23106M=s (5.5)
Usually, these initiation reactions become the limited step because of the relatively slow
reactions of the ozone molecule and hydroxyl ion (OH2)(Eqs. 5.3 and 5.4 ). However,
under alkaline conditions the hydroperoxide ion HO2
2/C0/C1
reacts with another ozone mole-
cule much faster than the former reactions and generates a hydroperoxyl radical (HO 2),
which decomposes into another free radical, and the chain reactions are propagated,
such as:
HO/C15
2-O/C152

Under alkaline conditions, the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is also sug-
gested by the following reactions:
HO2
21H1-H2O2k85531010M=s (5.14)
Actually, hydrogen peroxide is an initiator and promoter of ozone decomposition,
which is the basis of the ozone/hydrogen peroxide (O 3/H 2O2) AOPs.
The hydroxyl radical has a higher oxidation potential (2.8 V) than the molecular ozone
and can attack organic and inorganic compounds non-selectively with very high reaction
rates ( Andreozzi et al., 1999 ). The second order reaction rate constants between the ozone
and the reactant ( k/C15
OH), and can be in the order of 108to 1010M/s. Therefore, the indirect
ozone reactions are often responsible for the destruction of many recalcitrant organic com-
pounds in water and wastewater ( Ikehata and Gamal El-Din, 2004, 2005a, 2005b; Ikehata117 5.2 OZONE-BASED AOPs
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTet al., 2006 ). A number of reactions may occur, when organic and inorganic compounds
are exposed to hydroxyl radicals, namely hydrogen abstraction, radical /C0radical reactions,
electrophilic addition, and electron transfer reactions ( Oppenla ¨nder, 2003 ). In addition to
hydroxyl radicals, other reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radical anions O/C152
2/C0/C1
,
hydroperoxyl radicals (HO/C15
2), triplet oxygen (3O2), and organic peroxyl radicals (ROO),
also participate in the indirect reactions of ozonation and ozone-based AOP.
There are a number of reactions that can terminate the indirect ozone reactions.
Carbonate CO22
3/C0/C1
, bicarbonate HCO2
3/C0/C1
,tert-butanol, p-chlorobenzoate, and humic sub-
stances are known inhibitors of ozone decomposition. These substances are also called
hydroxyl radical scavengers. A high concentration of hydrogen peroxide also acts as an
inhibitor of ozone decomposition.
5.2.1 Ozone/Hydrogen Peroxide
The O 3/H 2O2AOP is probably the best-studied and best-implemented ozone-based
AOP for water and wastewater treatment. The O 3/H 2O2process was extensively studied
byStaehelin and Hoigne ´(1982) . At a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide (1025to
1024M), ozone decomposition in water is accelerated and as a result, the hydroxyl radical
concentration increases. It was found that the only ionic form of hydrogen peroxide
(hydroperoxide ion, HO2
2) reacted with ozone according to Eq. (5.5) to initiate the free rad-
ical reactions. Since the reaction rate constant for this reaction is very large (in the order of
106M/s), ozone is decomposed very rapidly in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, and
the contaminants liable to hydroxyl radical reactions can be degraded in the O 3/H 2O2
AOP very effectively. It is known that the ratio of 2 mol of ozone per mol of hydrogen per-
oxide is the optimum stoichiometry for this process ( Beltra ´n, 2003 ). In drinking water
treatment, the ratios of 0.2 to 0.5 mg H 2O2per mg O 3are generally used ( Rakness, 2005 ).
In the O 3/H 2O2AOP, unless the reactivity of the target contaminant against the molecular
ozone is very high (i.e., the second order rate constant k.106M/s), much of contaminant
degradation occurs via indirect reactions with hydroxyl radicals.
5.2.2 Ozone/UV
The ozone/UV (O 3/UV) AOP is another well-studied ozone-based AOP. Dissolved
ozone molecules absorb UV light with a peak absorbance at 260 nm and a molar absorptiv-
ity of 3292 670 M/cm ( Hart et al., 1983 ). Upon the irradiation of UV, the dissolved ozone
molecules undergo photolysis reactions to yield hydrogen peroxide ( Beltra ´n, 2003 ):
O31H2O1hν-H2O2 (5.15)
This hydrogen peroxide can initiate the ozone decomposition. Alternatively, a hydrogen
peroxide molecule may undergo another photolysis reaction to form two hydroxyl
radicals.
H2O21hν-2/C15OH (5.16)118 5. OZONE-BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIn addition to the molecular ozone and hydroxyl radical reactions, the target contami-
nant may be photolyzed, if the contaminant absorbs UV light (around 254 nm, when low-
pressure mercury vapor UV lamps are used) with a significant molar absorptivity
(Oppenla ¨nder, 2003 ).
5.2.3 Catalytic Ozonation
Various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation processes have been pro-
posed and tested in water and wastewater treatment ( Beltra ´n, 2003 ). Many transition metal
ions such as cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II), iron(II), manganese(II), and zinc(II) were
found to enhance the contaminant degradation in water. Hill (1948) first reported the
ozone decomposition in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst cobalt(II) in an acidic
medium.
O31Co211H2O-/C15OH1CoOH211O2k537M =min (5.17)
The generation of hydroxyl radical through the direct oxidation of cobalt(II) ion with
ozone suggested that the catalytic ozonation is an AOP. In addition to dissolved metal
ions, various metal oxides such as copper(II) oxide (CuO), manganese dioxide (MnO 2),
titanium dioxide (TiO 2), and iron(III) oxide (Fe 2O3), as well as palladium and activated
carbon, were also found to act as heterogenous catalysts of ozone decomposition. Addition
of UV irradiation and hydrogen peroxide to the homogenous/heterogeneous catalytic
ozonation has also been actively studied. This type of ozone-based AOP appeared to be
useful in wastewater treatment, especially for high-strength industrial wastewaters and
landfill leachates that contain high concentrations of recalcitrant organic contaminants.
Beltra ´n (2003) discussed this topic in details.
5.3 OZONATION BY-PRODUCTS
The formation of smaller organic molecules during ozonation of water and wastewater
treatment have the following implications:
generation of organic acids
impact on pH
generation of more biologically degradable organics
impact on biological stability (mostly drinking water treatment)
better performance of subsequent biological treatment (mostly wastewater treatment)
generation of aldehydes
aldehydes such as formaldehyde are regulated, genotoxic compounds
In addition, ozonation also produces two types of disinfection byproducts, namely
bromate BrO2
3/C0/C1
and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) ( Najim and Trussell, 2001, Von
Gunten and Hoigne ´, 1994 ). Both ozonation byproducts are probable carcinogens
(Rakness, 2005; WHO, 2005, 2008 ) and are of public health concern. There are numerous
published research papers and review articles available on this subject ( Kransner et al.,119 5.3 OZONATION BY-PRODUCTS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT2013; Mitch et al., 2004; Ozekin et al., 1998; Wert et al., 2007 ). The formation of NDMA
and its control/removal is one of the key issues in advanced water reclamation for
potable reuse.
5.4 WASTEWATER OZONATION AND OZONE-BASED AOPs
The use of ozone in wastewater treatment can be dated back to the 1970s as both,
municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants started using ozone at that time
(Rice, 1996; Robson and Rice, 1991 ). The major objective of ozonation in wastewater treat-
ment is disinfection and pathogen inactivation after biological secondary treatment, espe-
cially in municipal wastewater treatment. Ozone-based treatment has also been tested and
used for pre-oxidation of biorefractory compounds ( Lin et al., 2001 ), improvement of phys-
icochemical treatment ( Jekel, 1994 ), odor mitigation ( Kerc and Olmez, 2010 ), and sludge
treatment ( Nagare et al., 2008 ) in many parts of the world.
5.4.1 Municipal Wastewater Treatment
A majority of ozone uses in municipal wastewater treatment are for effluent disinfec-
tion. The uses of ozone-based AOPs in municipal wastewater treatment is limited because
the effective ozone exposure for disinfection, which is measured by the product of residual
concentration and time ( Ct), will be lost upon the addition of hydrogen peroxide and/or
UV because these agents induce the ozone decomposition. However, due to the concerns
over trace organic contaminants, such as pesticides, endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuti-
cals, and personal care products, in the wastewater and treated effluent, many researchers
have studied the effectiveness of ozone-based AOPs to destroy these organic compounds
in wastewater ( Borikar et al., 2015; Ikehata and Gamal El-Din, 2005a, 2005b; Ikehata et al.,
2006; Snyder et al., 2006; Tsuno et al., 2010 ).
5.4.2 Industrial Wastewater Treatment
Rice (1996) andBeltra ´n (2003) reviewed a number of earlier ozone applications in indus-
trial wastewater treatment, including:
aquaculture
aquarium
electroplating
electronic chip manufacturing
textile industry
petroleum refineries
oil shale wastewater
chemical manufacturing
pulp and paper
food and beverage industry
tanneries120 5. OZONE-BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTpharmaceutical industry
plastic and resins
hospital wastewater
landfill leachate
Those industrial wastewater treatment processes typically involve the degradation of
toxic organics, such as phenolics and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, removal of color, and
oxidation of inorganics, such as iron, manganese, chromium, sulfides, and cyanides
(Beltra ´n, 2003; Rice, 1996 ).
In general, wastewater contains high levels of organic and inorganic compounds that
react with ozone very quickly, such as phenols, synthetic dyes, and other substituted aro-
matics. In this case, the ozone reactions are often mass transfer controlled and direct ozone
reaction dominated ( Beltra ´n, 2003 ). In addition, hydroxyl radical scavengers, such as car-
bonate and bicarbonate, are often present at high concentrations, which inhibits the indi-
rect ozone reactions. However, there are many reports investigating the ozone-based
AOPs, including O 3/H 2O2and/or O 3/UV AOPs, for the treatment of industrial wastewa-
ter, such as oil shale wastewater ( Munter et al., 1993 ), landfill leachate ( Haapea et al., 2002;
Leitzke, 1993 ), pulp mill effluent ( Munter et al., 1993; Murphy et al., 1993 ), textile waste-
water ( Ledakowicz and Solecka, 2001 ), pharmaceutical wastewater ( Ho¨fl et al., 1997 ), and
table olive wastewater ( Beltra ´n et al., 1999 ). These reports suggest a great promise of
ozone-based AOP for industrial wastewater treatment.
5.5 RECENT STUDIES
Different studies on wastewater treatment using ozone-based AOPs have been reported
(Table 5.1 ). This list only includes works dealing with actual wastewater or effluent sam-
ples. Many of them investigated several different AOPs, including ozone-based processes,
as well as non-ozone-based processes, such as UV/H 2O2, TiO 2photocatalysis, and
ultrasound-based technologies, concurrently. As can be seen in this table, ozone-based
processes were tested for the treatment of a wide variety of wastewater, including landfill
leachate, pulp and paper effluent, shaft furnace gas cleaning plant effluent, oil refinery
effluent, industrial laundry wastewater, ballast water, swine manure, domestic sewage
effluent, and hospital wastewater. The applications of unconventional AOPs, such as
ultrasonic-based technologies ( Babu et al., 2016; Ibanez et al., 2013 ), O 3/persulfate ( Abu
Amr et al., 2013 ), and electro-peroxone ( Yao et al., 2016 ), in wastewater treatment have
also been reported.
5.5.1 Landfill Leachate Treatment
Landfill leachate, especially from mature and stabilized landfills, contains high concen-
trations of organic and inorganic compounds that inhibit the performance of conventional
biological treatment. Different types of chemical oxidation, including ozonation, have been
attempted to improve the treatability of landfill leachate ( Beltra ´n, 2003 ). Recently, Abu
Amr et al. (2013) compared the effects of persulfate (S 2O822) and ozone, as well as the121 5.5 RECENT STUDIES

ammonia-N from a leachate sample from a semi-aerobic stabilized landfill. They opti-
mized the ozone:COD ratio for COD removal (0.60 kg O 3/kg COD) and found that the
combined method (O 3/S2O822) achieved the highest removal efficiency as compared with
other methods, including the O 3/Fenton process. Similarly, Qiao et al. (2014) investigated
the treatment of leachate from a stabilized landfill using the O 3/H 2O2AOP to improve the
removal of specific organic compounds, namely 17 β-estradiol and two phosphate-based
flame retardants [tris-(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and tris-(butoxyethyl) phosphate] and
anaerobic biodegradation of organics. Direct oxidation of compounds was possible with
the O 3/H 2O2AOP at relatively low ozone doses (up to 7.5 mg/L). Ghazi et al. (2014) stud-
ied the impact of landfill ages on the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of landfill leachate
during the O 3/H 2O2AOP. They found that the dissolved organic matter in the leachate
from a younger landfill exhibited about one order of magnitude faster radical scavenging
effect than the leachate from a more mature landfill.
5.5.2 Industrial Wastewater Treatment
Several different types of industrial wastwaters were tested for their treatability with sev-
eral ozone-based AOPs in recent years ( Table 5.1 ). Many of the reports investigated the
applicability of the AOP technology for internal reuse. Pulp and paper mills are often
required to reduce their freshwater usage and achieve zero liquid discharge by internal
water reuse. Hermosilla et al. (2015) reviewed the recent reports on the treatment of pulp
and paper wastewater using various AOPs as one of the zero-liquid discharge technologies.TABLE 5.1 (Continued)

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe ozone-based AOPs have been extensively studied and have been successfully imple-
mented at an industrial scale. Merayo et al. (2013) studied the combination treatment using
ozone or TiO 2photocatalysis followed by the membrane bioreactor (MBR) to remove COD
from pulp and paper effluents. Ozonation alone could reduce COD by 35% /C060% and could
further improve biodegradability of effluents in the subsequent biological treatment.
The O 3/UV AOP has been tested for the treatment of shaft furnace gases’ cleaning
water ( Czaplicka et al., 2013 ), oil refinery wastewater ( Souza et al., 2016 ), and industrial
laundry wastewater ( Mozia et al., 2016 ). The latter two intended to use the AOP to
degrade organic matter and prevent fouling in the subsequent membrane processes, such
as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Riano et al. (2014) compared ozonation
and O 3/H 2O2AOP with the Fenton process for the removal of color and COD from bio-
logically treated swine manure. They found that the Fenton process was more
suitable than ozone-based processes for this type of wastewater treatment. Ozone-based
AOPs other than the O 3/H 2O2and O 3/UV processes have been studied for industrial
wastewater treatment. Wu et al. (2011) examined the combination of silver-TiO 2photocata-
lysis and ozone for the inactivation of marine dinoflagellate alga Amphidinium sp. in ballast
water. Babu et al. (2016) reviewed the applications of ultrasound-based AOPs, including
sono-O 3processes, for wastewater treatment.
5.5.3 Domestic/Municipal Wastewater Treatment
Ozone-based AOPs have been studied extensively for the treatment of domestic/munic-
ipal wastewater. Most of the studies concerned the removal of trace organic contaminants,
such as endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, from biologi-
cally treated wastewater ( Espejo et al., 2014; Ibanez et al., 2013; Katsoyiannis et al., 2011;
Lee et al., 2016; Richard et al., 2014; Santiago-Morales et al., 2012; Sarkar et al., 2014; Tuerk
et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2016 ).Espejo et al. (2014) investigated the use of ozonation
combined with UV-A and iron(III) or iron(II,III) oxide (magnetite, Fe 3O4) catalysts as a
pretreatment for the secondary biological treatment of municipal wastewater. The effective
removal of nine pharmaceuticals was demonstrated by the AOP. Richard et al. (2014) stud-
ied the degradation of bisphenol A, ciprofloxacin, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole in
surface water and wastewater by ozonation and the UV/H 2O2process. Similarly, Turek
et al. (2010) studied the oxidation of cytostatic drug, cyclophosphamide by ozonation, and
UV/H 2O2process. Degradation of two synthetic musk compounds, namely galaxolide and
tonalide, was studied by Santiago-Morales et al. (2012) .
The potential of ozone-based AOPs in water reclamation and reuse, including
potable reuse, was also actively discussed in recent years ( Bustos et al., 2010; Lee et al.,
2016).Bustos et al. (2010) reported the use of the O 3/UV AOP for the disinfection of efflu-
ent from a small sewage treatment plant at Universidad Auto ´noma Metropolitana
Azcapotzalco in Mexico to achieve on-site reuse. Lee et al. (2016) suggested the use of
sequential AOPs, the O 3/H 2O2followed by UV/H 2O2, might be beneficial to reduce the
oxidation byproducts namely bromate and NDMA during the advanced water reclama-
tion. Formation/degradation of NDMA in surface water and wastewater by O 3/H 2O2and
UV/H 2O2was also studied by Katsoyiannis et al. (2011) .124 5. OZONE-BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT5.5.4 Hospital Wastewater Treatment
Hospital wastewater contains high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and therefore,
their degradation and removal by AOPs including ozone-based processes are important.
Cesen et al. (2015) reported the improved biodegradation of two cytostatic drugs, cyclo-
phosphamide, and ifosfamide, from a hospital’s wastewater using the O 3/H 2O2/UV pro-
cess. Similarly, Kist et al. (2013) studied the glutaraldehyde removal from secondary
effluent samples from a regional hospital in southwestern Brazil by the O 3/UV process.
Lee et al. (2014) investigated the degradation of 67 trace organics in the effluent from a
pilot-scale MBR at a hospital using ozonation and O 3/H 2O2AOP. They found that a
majority of the trace organics could be eliminated by the ozone-based treatment processes.
5.5.5 Ozone-Based Municipal Wastewater Treatment and Water Reuse
in the United States
In the United States, ozone was first introduced to municipal water and wastewater
treatment in the early 20th century ( Rice, 1999 ). About 300 water treatment plants in the
United States currently use ozone for disinfection, taste and color control, and/or contami-
nant oxidation ( Thompson and Drago, 2015 ). Ozone has been used in municipal wastewa-
ter treatment since the 1970s ( Robson and Rice, 1991 ) and gained its popularity in the
1980s, when up to 45 wastewater treatment plants were using ozone treatment in the
United States. The primary treatment objective of those earlier installations was disinfec-
tion of the primary and secondary effluent. In addition, odor control, sludge oxidation,
organics oxidation, and suspended solids removal were also the drivers of ozone applica-
tions in the wastewater treatment plants. However, the number of ozone applications in
wastewater treatment declined significantly during the 1990s and 2000s because of the
high cost of operations and maintenance, as well as the high capital cost requirement of
aged equipment renewal. A few ozone facilities retired in the 2010s, including the ones in
Hagerstown, Maryland and Indianapolis, Indiana. As of today, there are only nine opera-
tional ozone-based wastewater treatment facilities in the United States ( Table 5.2 ).
The treatment capacities of the existing municipal ozone wastewater treatment facilities
range from about 1000 /C08000 m3/h, while the ozone generation capacities range from
10/C0100 kg/h. In many cases, liquid oxygen (LOX) is used as an oxygen source. Ozone gas
is typically injected by a side-stream method using multiple venturi injectors and flash
reactors ( Fig. 5.1 ).
One of the major goals of ozone treatment at the wastewater treatment facilities is water
reuse ( Table 5.2 ). In fact, due to the recent drought in the Southwestern United States,
more and more utilities are considering adapting advanced water reclamation trains to
produce potable water from secondary or tertiary treated wastewater. Ozone can provide
a number of benefits in water reuse, including odor and color removal, virus and protozoa
inactivation, and contaminant oxidation ( Gerrity and Snyder, 2011 ). As a result, the use of
ozone in wastewater treatment is again becoming an active topic in the United States.
Here, several state-of-the-art municipal wastewater ozonation projects in the United States
are described.125 5.5 RECENT STUDIES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT5.6 EXISTING OZONE-BASED ADVANCED WATER
RECLAMATION FACILITIES
In the United States, most of the advanced water reclamation facilities are constructed
as separate facilities from the conventional wastewater treatment plants. In particular, the
advanced treatment facilities designed to achieve very high reclaimed water quality for
such uses as potable reuse, include a series of membrane processes such as microfiltration
(MF), ultrafiltration (UF), NF, and RO, as well as UV-based AOPs ( Fig. 5.2 ).
The MF/UF process removes suspended solids prior to RO, which removes a majority
(up to 99%) of dissolved constituents including both inorganic and organic compounds.
The UV/H 2O2AOP is added for NDMA and 1,4-dioxane destruction. There are at least
ten operational advanced water reclamation facilities in the Southwestern United States,
most notably in Southern California, including the Groundwater Replenishment System,TABLE 5.2 Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants Currently Using Ozone in the United States

the Leo J. Vander Lans Advanced Water Treatment Facility, Water Replenishment District
of Southern California (Long Beach, CA).
There are opportunities for the ozone-based treatment to complement or replace the
unit processes in this advanced water reclamation process scheme, such as:
add ozone or ozone-biological filtration prior to MF/UF
replace the UV/H 2O2AOP with an ozone-based AOP
use NF instead of RO and add an ozone-based AOP
In all cases, ozone is expected to act as a barrier against both pathogenic microorgan-
isms (viruses and protozoa) and trace organic compounds. In addition, many studies have
been reported that the addition of preozonation reduced the fouling of subsequent MF or
UF ( Pisarenko et al., 2012, Van Geluwe et al., 2011 ). Because the NDMA removal capacity
of ozone-based AOPs is limited ( Lee et al., 2016 ), UV-based treatment is still needed for
the photolysis of NDMA. The ozone-based AOP can supplement the trace organic removal
capacity of NF in the last case. The use of NF is beneficial, whereas brine disposal is very
costly and higher water recovery ( .90%) is desired.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTTwo existing advanced water reclamation facilities, namely the Edward C. Little WRF
and Scottsdale Water Campus Advanced Water Treatment Facility (AWTF), implemented
the preozonation approach. The Edward C. Little WRF was built as one of the first major
advanced water reclamation facilities using RO in 1992. In 2013, ozone was added to the
process scheme anticipating the reduction of MF fouling as shown in Fig. 5.3 . However,
the addition of ozone induced several unexpected side effects, including elevated levels of
NDMA, aldehydes, and total organic carbon in the final product water ( Daniel and
Oelker, 2016 ). NDMA and aldehydes are known ozonation by-products ( Najim and
Trussell, 2001, Rakness, 2005 ). Those side effects could be mitigated by lowering the ozone
dose, which ironically sacrificed the intended effect of ozone on MF fouling reduction.
NDMA and aldehydes, and other biodegradable organics such as ketones could be
removed by biological filtration such as biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration.
The Scottsdale Water Campus AWTF have a very similar process scheme as the
Edward C. Little WRF ( Figs. 5.4 and 5.5 ). The differences are the absence of UV AOP and
the feed water quality (tertiary vs. secondary), as well as UF vs. MF. To date, no byproduct
issues have been reported at the Scottsdale plant, probably because the feed water
received nitrification and denitrification in the upstream water reclamation plant.MF RO UV/H2O2Secondary

and to degrade trace organics in the tertiary effluent.
5.7 PLANNED OZONE-BASED ADVANCED WATER
RECLAMATION PROJECTS
In the United States, the number of ozone-based advanced water reclamation projects is
currently increasing. At least six active projects in several arid/semi-arid states are recog-
nized ( Table 5.3 ). Two notable projects are described here. Pure Water San Diego (San
Diego, CA) is a well-known indirect/direct potable reuse project that employs the stan-
dard MF/UF-RO-UV AOP scheme with ozone-BAC filtration as a pretreatment ( Fig. 5.6 ).
The ozone-BAC component was actually added as an additional treatment barrier during
the demonstration study ( Fig. 5.7 ) due to the increasing need and public acceptance
towards direct potable reuse in the area ( Pearce et al., 2016 ). Phase 1 of the full-scale water
purification facility will be completed by 2021 and highly purified reclaimed water will be
sent to one of the source water reservoirs (Miramar Reservoir) for drinking water produc-
tion ( City of San Diego, 2017 ).
The second example is the planned advanced treatment at Rio Rancho’s Cabezon Water
Reclamation Plant. This is a non-RO-based potable reuse project using MBR followed by
the O 3/H 2O2AOP and BAC ( Marley, 2010 ). Once completed, this is probably one of the
first non-RO potable reuse projects that will use an ozone-based AOP for contaminant oxi-
dation and disinfection in the United States. ( Fig. 5.8 ). According to Marley (2010) , the

pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. The purpose of adding hydrogen peroxide,
is for bromate formation control. NDMA formation and control is also a key issue in
ozone-based advanced water reclamation schemes, especially where RO is not used as a
barrier ( Fig. 5.8 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTdecades. Ozone-based treatment is particularly useful for the treatment of wastewater that
has color originating from natural (e.g., lignin) and synthetic (e.g., dyes) aromatic
compounds. These aromatic compounds are highly resistant against biological oxidation.
Ozone can alter the chemical structures of those recalcitrant organics into more biodegrad-
able forms. Ozonation is also highly effective in degrading trace organic compounds in
municipal and hospital wastewater, and is becoming a critical component of advanced
water reclamation schemes for potable reuse. Despite their slow adaptation to full-scale
treatment facilities, ozone-based AOPs have been actively studied for their potential uses
in wastewater treatment for many years. Since ozone itself is an expensive and highly-
technically involved process, the combination of ozone and additional chemical/physical
agents such as hydrogen peroxide and UV requires significantly higher capital and opera-
tional costs and may not be feasible in many wastewater treatment projects. However, as
the population growth continues and water scarcity becomes more and more severe in
densely populated areas, the demand for more advanced wastewater treatment technolo-
gies including ozone-based AOPs is anticipated to increase. It is probably desirable to
develop more cost-effective and more operator-friendly ozone-based AOPs for smaller
wastewater treatment and water reclamation projects.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Industrialization, technologies, and consumption of nonrenewable sources are increas-
ing at a rapid rate since the last few decades, because of regular continuous increasing
demands of materials related to textile, dye, fertilizer, domestic, plastic, etc. As a conse-
quence, environmental pollution and energy crises have already reached an alarming
stage. The industrial wastes are more toxic, and nonbiodegradable as compared to munici-
pal wastes because these consist of fats, oil, grease, heavy metals, phenols, and ammonia,
etc. ( Mutamim et al., 2012 ). The agriculture and pharmaceutical effluents release pesticides
and other chemicals that are responsible for some chronic diseases, harmful for human
endocrine, making water not useful for drinking and other end uses ( Das, 2014 ). There is
an urgent need to develop some newer technologies that are eco-friendly in nature and
lead to degradation or complete elimination of environmental pollutants and thus, prove
to be an alternative clean strategy. In other words, there should be a sustainable solution
to the problem.
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are an environmentally friendly technique for
the removal of almost all types of pollutants: air pollutants, water pollutants such as aro-
matics, petroleum based contents, petroleum hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons,
pesticides, insecticides, volatile organic compounds (VOC), dyes, and other organic materi-
als (Zhang et al., 2014 ). AOPs are based on the generation of reactive oxygen species like
hydroxyl radicals with one unpaired electron, and because of this, they possess short life
times. Therefore, they actively and readily react with a series of chemical species, which
are otherwise very difficult to degrade. AOPs are comparatively better than other conven-
tional methods because they generate thermodynamically stable oxidation products such

cess, which plays an important role in harvesting sunlight by a photocatalyst. Then, these
photocatalysts have been used effectively to solve the problems related to environment
pollution and energy crises in the presence of different ranges of solar spectrum ( Sang
et al., 2015, Solanki et al., 2015a ).
6.2 PHOTCATALYSIS
The term photocatalyst is a combination of two words: photo related to photon and cat-
alyst, which is a substance altering the reaction rate in its presence. Therefore, photocata-
lysts are materials that change the rate of a chemical reaction on exposure to light. This
phenomenon is known as photocatalysis. Photocatalysis includes reactions that take place
by utilizing light and a semiconductor. The substrate that absorbs light and acts as a cata-
lyst for chemical reactions is known as a photocatalyst. All the photocatalysts are basically
semiconductors. Photocatalysis is a phenomenon, in which an electron-hole pair is gener-
ated on exposure of a semiconducting material to light.
The photocatalytic reactions can be categorized into two types on the basis of appear-
ance of the physical state of reactants.
Homogeneous photocatalysis : When both the semiconductor and reactant are in the same
phase, i.e. gas, solid, or liquid, such photocatalytic reactions are termed as
homogeneous photocatalysis.
Heterogeneous photocatalysis : When both the semiconductor and reactant are in different
phases, such photocatalytic reactions are classified as heterogeneous photocatalysis.
The energy difference between the valence band (HOMO) and the conduction band
(LUMO) are known as the band gap (Eg). On the basis of band gap, the materials are clas-
sified into three basic categories ( Fig. 6.1 ):
metal or conductor: Eg ,1.0 eV
semiconductor: Eg ,1.5/C03.0 eV
insulator: Eg .5.0 eV
FIGURE 6.1 Different types of materials.136 6. PHOTOCATALYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTSemiconductors are capable of conducting electricity even at room temperature in the
presence of light and hence, work as photocatalysts. When a photocatalyst is exposed to
light of the desired wavelength (sufficient energy), the energy of photons is absorbed by
an electron (e2) of valence band and it is excited to conduction band. In this process a
hole (h1) is created in valence band. This process, leads to the formation of photo-
excitation state, and e2and h1pair is generated. This excited electron is used for reducing
an acceptor in which a hole is used for oxidation of donor molecules. The importance of
photocatalysis lies in the fact that a photocatalyst provides both oxidation as well as a
reduction environment and that too, simultaneously.
The fate of the excited electron and hole is decided by the relative positions of the con-
duction and valence bands of the semiconductor and the redox levels of substrate.
There are four ways in which the semiconductor and the substrate interact with each
other depending upon the relative positions of the valence and conduction bands and the
redox levels. The four different combinations are ( Fig. 6.2 ):
1.Reduction of substrate takes place, when the redox level of substrate is lower than the
conduction band of the semiconductor.
2.Oxidation of substrate takes place, when the redox level of the substrate is higher than
the valence band of the semiconductor.
3.Neither oxidation nor reduction is possible, when the redox level of the substrate is
higher than the conduction band and lower than the valence band of the
semiconductor.
4.Both reduction and oxidation of the substrate take place, when the redox level of the
substrate is lower than the conduction band and higher than the valence band.
Photocatalysts may be used for antifouling, antifogging, conservation and storage of
energy, deodorization, sterilization, self-cleaning, air purification, wastewater treatment,
etc. Semicoductors act as sensitizers for photoredox processes due to their electronic struc-
ture. Some semiconductors are able to photocatalyze the complete mineralization of many
organic pollutants like aromatics, halo hydrocarbons, insecticides, pesticides, dyes, and
surfactants ( Fig. 6.3 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTMetal oxides have a wide range of application to solve environmental problems and in
electronics due to their capacity to form charge carriers when they are exposed to light.
Metal oxides have properties like:
required electronic structure
light absorption properties
charge transport characteristics
Semiconductor-mediated photocatalysis has gained huge attention as it helps to over-
come the problem related to fast charge recombination ( Wang et al., 2014 ).
6.2.1 Binary Oxides
Chan et al. (2011) categorized photocatalyst into three categories:
1.titanium dioxide,
2.zinc oxide, and
3.other metal oxides like molybdenum oxide, vanadium oxide, indium oxide, tungsten
oxide, and cerium oxide.
Since the last few decades, heterogeneous binary metal oxides photocatalysts like TiO 2,
V2O5, ZnO, Fe 2O3, CdO, CdS, and Al 2O3(Karunakaran and Senthilvelan, 2005 ) have been
studied extensively for the removal of organic colored pollutants such as azo dye, acid
orange 7 ( Vinodgopal et al., 1996a,b ), methylene blue ( Fabiyi and Skelton, 2000 ), alizarin S,
methyl red, Congo red, orange G ( Sivalingam et al., 2003 ). The mineralization of organic
pollutants into CO 2,N H 41,N O 32, and SO 422, respectively ( Houas et al., 2001 ) takes place
by formation of O 22, HOO/C15,o rO H/C15through a multistep reduction which can be detected
by ESR spin-trapping technique ( Liu et al., 2000 ).
TiO 2was used for the full oxidation, detoxification and complete mineralization of dyes
like, alizarin S, methyl red, Congo red, methylene blue, crocein orange G ( Lachheb et al.,
2002) dyes in aqueous solutions under irradiation of UV light. Curri et al. (2003) prepared
nanoparticles of ZnO and TiO 2by a nonhydrolytic process and compared its performance
for elimination of methylene blue with commercial TiO 2and ZnO powders. The enhanced
efficiency observed was due to crystallinity, nano-size structure, a large amount of surface
FIGURE 6.3 Degradation of organic pollutants.138 6. PHOTOCATALYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENThydroxyl species and reduced band-gap ( Nagaveni et al., 2004 ). The hierarchical hetero-
structure along with morphology, specific composition, and functionalities is one of the
important factors, which determine the applicability of a sample ( Liu et al., 2017 ). On the
base of TiO 2nanosheets the MIL-100(Fe) was fabricated by a self-assembly method into
hierarchical sandwich-like heterostructures for degradation of methylene blue dye (MB)
under visible light ( λ$420 nm). Such a structure increases the absorption ability and
superior separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. As a result, photocatalytic per-
formance also enhances ( Fig. 6.4 ).
Fluroxypyr (FLX) found in the surface or ground water has been removed at basic pH,
i.e., 8/C010, by using Degussa P-25 Titania as a photocatalyst. It followed half order kinetics
Aramendı ´a et al. (2005) . First order elimination of nitrobenzene and substituted nitroben-
zenes was carried out with combustion synthesized and commercial TiO 2under illumina-
tion of UV light by Priya and Madras (2006) .
The photooxidation of aniline to azobenzene in protic solvent ethanol in the presence of
Fe2O3photocatalyst takes place at a higher rate at 254 nm than that at 365 nm.
Karunakaran and Senthilvelan (2006) observed that photooxidation under sunlight or UV
light depends on the type of protic and aprotic solvents. Furthermore, Karunakaran and
Dhanalakshmi (2008) reported that not all the photocatalysts have efficiency or perfor-
mance. For instance, TiO 2(anatase), Fe 2O3, CuO, ZnO, ZnS, ZrO 2, PbO, PbO 2, CdO, HgO
degrade phenol under natural sunlight whereas MoO 3,C o 3O4, CdS, SnO 2,S b 2O3,L a 2O3,
Pb2O3,B i 2O3, CeO 2,S m 2O3, and Eu 2O3do not degrade phenol. Tungsten oxide nanoparti-
cles synthesized by sol-gel method exhibited complete mineralization of dyes under laser
irradiation within few minutes ( Qamar et al., 2009 ).
Polisetti et al. (2011) studied the effect of different parameters such as pH, inorganic salts,
and H 2O2on degradation of anionic dyes such as orange G, amido black, remazol brilliant
blue R, and alizarin cyanine green with help of ZrO 2. The physicochemical of the prepared
sample has been characterized by FT-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectros-
copy, FT-infrared spectroscopy, UV /C0vis spectroscopy, BET surface area analysis, and zero

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTpoint charge pH measurement. Elamin and Elsanousi (2013) applied photooxidation for
removal of methyl orange by nanostructure zinc oxide (ZnO). Solution combustion method
was used for the preparation of nanocrystalline α-Fe2O3,which was tested by photocatalytic
removal of rhodamine B under irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light.
Gondal et al. (2009) studied disinfecting Escherichia coli microorganism in water by
nano-WO 3prepared by sol gel method in the presence of laser light. Binary metal oxides
namely, ferric oxides, manganese oxides, aluminum oxides, titanium oxides, magnesium
oxides, and cerium oxides are also efficient in removal of heavy metal due to high surface
area and specific affinity for heavy metal adsorption from solution ( Hua et al., 2012 ).
Zhang et al. (2017) studied degradation of organic pollutants like phenol, hydrochlo-
ride, and rhodamine B dye by a direct Z-scheme carbon nanodots/WO 3nanorods compos-
ite in presence of visible light. The photocatalyst decorated by carbon on its surface, leads
to synergistic effect and enhances performance three times in comparison to simple WO 3
nanorods ( Fig. 6.5 ). The degradation percentages by various samples were:
Carbon Dots/WO 3. Prepared WO 3nanorods . Commercial WO 3nanoparticles
(97.1%, 99.1%, 61.2%) (66.6%, 69.1%, 22.4%) (22.1%, 11.6%, B0%)
Binary metal oxides combination alters the solar radiation harvesting capability, which
directly affects its performance ( Li, 2013 ). Composites show higher efficiency than its indi-
vidual semiconductor ( Vinodgopal et al., 1996a,b ).Wu et al. (2006) synthesized couples
CdS/TiO 2through microemulsion-mediated solvothermal method at low temperature.
They showed that the CdS semiconductor acts as a sensitizer for titania therefore,
enhances the oxidation of methylene blue in water or nitric oxide in air under visible light
irradiation. CdS/TiO 2powder fabricated via a sol gel method by varying content of CdS
from 5% to 50% (w/w). The increased photocatalytic degradation of an anionic azo-dye,
i.e. orange II was observed for composite under a light of wavelength more than 400 nm.
The composite with lower content of CdS performed better than semiconductors in pure

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTform ( Bessekhouad et al., 2006 ). Various composites such as CuO /C0SnO 2, ZrO 2/C0TiO 2,
SnO 2/TiO 2, TiO 2/WO 3,F e 2O3/SnO 2, TiO 2/C0ZrO 2, ZnO /C0SiO 2, and CNTs /C0CoO/C0TiO 2
(Dlamini et al., 2011 ) have been used for treatment of acid blue 62 dye, 4-chlorophenol,
rhodamine-B, methylene blue, acid blue 62, phenol, and Hg (II) reduction ( Xia et al., 2007;
Neppolian et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008; Akurati et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2008; Kambur et al.,
2012; Mohamed and Aazama, 2012 ).
TiO 2/WO 3and TiO 2/SnO 2systems degrade 4-chlorophenol at a slow rate of 369 nm,
whereas pure component shows no degradation at this wavelength. But at 435 nm, the
degradation rate of 4-chlorophenol increases using the same composites ( Lin et al., 2008 ).
The impregnation method was used for fabrication of WO 3/C0TiO 2photocatalysts. The het-
erojunction between monoclinic amorphous WO 3over TiO 2helps in trapping an electron
which accelerates the degradation of bisphenol A ( Zerjav et al., 2017 ).
Nanocomposites are formed not only by suitable combination of binary metal oxides,
but it can also be formed by use of appropriate metal along with a semiconductor. Fu and
Zhang (2010) treated TiO 2with negatively charged Au nanoparticles for modification. Au
get absorbed on the surface of a semiconductor at lower pH close to isolectric point of tita-
nia by electrostatic force of attraction. The degradation of bisphenol A by Au decorated
TiO 2nanocomposite film was accelerated by B2.5 folds due to the ultra-fine size, uniform
dispersion, physical separation, and high loading of Au nanoparticles. The Ag-coated TiO 2
composites prepared via an ultrasonication method reported to have higher activity
because of the excellent distribution and interaction of Ag nanoparticles with the TiO 2
nanofiber support ( Reddy et al., 2011 ).
TiO 2activity has been increased by coating it on silica substrate embedded with Ag
nanoparticles (TiO 2/C0SiO 2-Ag composites) with the help of ion implantation technique ( Xu
et al., 2013 ). The composites have potential application for removal of toxic and carcino-
genic motor vehicle exhaust and solvent utilization. TiO 2/C0SiO 2based photocatalysts exam-
ined for the elimination of VOCs toluene ( Zou et al., 2006 ).Magdalane et al. (2016) carried
out chemical precipitation and hydrothermal process for preparation of CeO 2-CdO nano-
composites by using cerium nitrate and cadmium nitrate. Band gap of coupled metal oxi-
des was 3.15 eV at 393 nm and 2.90 eV at 427 nm. Introduction of transition metal oxide
enhances the crystallinity, purity and stability of nanocomposites. The nanocomposite has
cubic structure with embedded Cd21ions in crystal lattice. This composite has better effi-
ciency to inhibit growth of bacteria P. aeruginosa (Fig. 6.6 ).
The addition of Ti (x)Zr(12x)O2(e.g. TiO 2/C0ZrO 2system) in polyethersulfone developed
the ultrafiltration membrane. In this the ZrO 2reduces the crystalline growth of titania dur-
ing the process. It was observed that as Zr content increases the band gap, i.e., the blue
shift also increases. The role of metal oxides is to alter the surface of the membrane by
affecting the hydrophilicity and porosity of modified membranes ( Sotto et al., 2014 ).
The use of metal free and co-catalyst positively influences the efficiency. The
Mn 0.25Cd0.75S/MoS 2composites synthesized by single step hydrothermal method reported
for hydrogen production from water splitting under visible-light irradiation. It shows bet-
ter efficiency than Mn 0.25Cd0.75S because the interfacial layer between Mn 0.25Cd0.75S and
MoS 2accelerates the electron transfer process from Mn 0.25Cd0.75St oM o S 2, which directly
helps in charge carrier separation ( Huang et al., 2017 )(Fig. 6.7 ).141 6.2 PHOTCATALYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT6.2.2 Ternary and Quaternary Oxides
Spins shape ZnFe 2O4(band gap 1.90 eV at 653 nm), Sr 7Fe10O22,and SrFe 12O19were syn-
thesized by polymeric method, and solid state method and applied for photo-
decomposition of isopropyl alcohol ( Jang et al., 2009, Doma et al., 2012 ). Semiconductor Ba
(In1/3Sn1/3M’1/3)O3(M represents the metal Sn, Pb, Nb, or Ta) has band gap in the range
of 2.97 /C03.30 eV. The replacement of electronegative non-transition metal cations provides
more sensitivity towards a broad range of solar spectrum. The change the band structure
enhances the removal of 4-chlorophenol ( Hur et al., 2005 ).
Quaternary metal oxides like Bi 4Nb xTa12xO8I(Hu et al., 2012 ), MnCoTiO 2(Kiriakidis
and Binas, 2014 ), and Pb 2FeNbO 6(Vijayasankara et al., 2013 ) photocatalysts synthesized

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTby various methods degrade dye contents into biodegradable product. The ternary nano-
hybrid ZnS-Ag 2S-RGO composite ( Reddy et al., 2015a ), ZnO-RuO 2/RGO ( Reddy et al.,
2015b ), and reduced graphene-oxide/titanium dioxide/zinc oxide (rGO/TiO 2/ZnO) have
great efficiency towards photocatalytic oxidation of rhodamine B and methylene blue. The
metal oxides of Zn /C0In (ZnIn-MMO) in combination with g-C 3N4show a higher perfor-
mance for degradation of rhodamine B to that of pure g-C 3N4and ZnIn-MMO under visi-
ble light ( Lan et al., 2015 ).
The core shell Ag 2S/Ag 3PO4composites were prepared by varying the content of Ag 2S.
The composite with 5% and 50% Ag 2S shows highest activity in visible light and NIR-
light-driven, respectively ( Tian et al., 2017 )(Fig. 6.8 ).
The one pot precipitation, hydrolysis, and UV photoreduction was used for preparation
of plasmonic Bi and BiOCl sheet decorated ZnSn(OH) 6that consist of cubic structure, and
14-facets polyhedral and octahedral system. The modification improves the abstraction of
photon, charge segregation, and migration performance, hence increases the photooxida-
tion of rhodamin B 81 times to that of pure ZnSn(OH) 6(Wang et al., 2017 ).
Hussein and Abass (2010) tried decolorization of dye without light and without catalyst,
and showed that decolorization occurs only in presence of both the catalyst and light.
There are various binary, ternary, and quaternary metal oxides like TiO 2, ZnO, SnO 2
(Gubbala et al., 2009 ), WO 3, ZnS, ZrO 2, CdO, HgO, PbO, PbO 2,F e 2O3, BiVO 4, SrTiO 3
(Modak and Ghosh, 2015 ), PbCrO 4, PbMoO 4, PbWO 4, etc. exhibiting photocatalytic activity
because of their low band gap, durability, stability, cost effectiveness, reusability, nontoxic
nature, etc. Different methods have been used for synthesis of various photocatalysts such
as hydrothermal-assisted sol-gel technique ( Khaghanpour and Naghibi, 2017 ), sol-gel dip
coating method ( Hamid and Rahman, 2003 ), electrochemical deposition process ( Samad
et al., 2016 ), Stober method ( Ameta et al., 2013 ), precipitation method ( Solanki et al.,
2015a ), combustion method ( Ma et al., 2014 ), etc. ( Table 6.1 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTAs most of the photocatalysts have wide band gap (E g) and these are active in UV region
only. Solar spectrum consists of only about 4% of UV light (wavelength less than 387 nm). In
this context, lots of investigations have been made to extend the photo-response of semicon-
ductors into the visible region ( Ali et al., 2012 ) and making use of 55% of the total solar radia-
tion ( Nyamukamba et al., 2017 ). Semiconductors provide promising solutions for
environmental pollution problems. Attempts have been made to enhance the photocatalytic
activity of these materials using various techniques. Semiconductors with wide band gap and
white color do not absorb in the visible range of spectrum. So a need arises to modify these
photocatalysts. Different methods have been used to modify the photocatalysts, like surface
modification, composite or coupling materials, metal and nonmetal doping, surface sensitiza-
tion by organic dyes and metal complexes, etc. These modifications can be done by various
techniques like doping with metal or nonmetal ( Rajkumar and Singh, 2015; Medina-Ramı ´rez
et al., 2014 ), codoping, combining different metal oxides (composites), sensitization, etc.
6.3 MODIFICATIONS
Enhancement in performance of a semiconductor can be obtained by four basic ways
(Marschall and Wang, 2014 )(Fig. 6.9 ). These are:
by formation of localized state just above the valence band,

by color centre formation in band gap,
and by surface modification.
Therefore, techniques involved in modifications are:
1.doping with metal and/or nonmetal
2.codoping with various combination of donor and acceptor materials
3.coupling photocatalysts (composite)
4.sensitization
5.substitution
6.miscellaneous
Wide band gap photocatalysts are colorless with high electron-hole recombination. The
light harvesting span of substance, electron-hole pair life time, and number of reactive
sites present on the semiconductor play an important role in photocatalytic performance
(Johar et al., 2015 )(Fig. 6.9 ).
6.3.1 Doping
Doping is one such modification of photocatalyst that reduces the band gap between
valence band and conduction band by adding impurities in an otherwise pure semicon-
ductor. Metals as well as nonmetals can be doped on a semiconductor. Each type of dop-
ant has a unique impact on the crystal lattice of the semiconductor. Metal and nonmetal
doping enhances the photo-responsiveness of the photocatalyst to the visible region by
creating new energy levels (also called the impurity state), between the valence band and
the conduction band ( Figs. 6.10 and 6.11 ). These new levels reduce the band gap, and the
excited electrons are shifted from the impurity state to the conduction band. Doping is
considered as a part of band gap engineering, which involves introduction of an electron
or hole in the photocatalytic semiconductor. Metal dopants like Co, Cr ( Bae et al., 2007 ), W
(Li et al., 2012 ), Cu, Zn ( Khairy and Zakaria, 2014 ), Mo ( Li et al., 2015 ), Mn, Fe, Ni ( Feng
et al., 2015 ), etc. give rise to a new band below the conduction band whereas, nonmetals
like N ( Zhang et al., 2013 ), P ( Kuo et al., 2014 ), F, Si, S, Cl, Se, Br, I ( Guo et al., 2015a ), etc.
create a new band above the valence band. It helps to avoids recombination by enhancing
trapping of electrons ( Xiao et al., 2008 ). As a consequence, photocatalytic activity also
increases. Metal dopants improve the morphology, surface area, photocatalytic

et al., 2013 ).
There are three possibilities in which a nonmetal reacts with oxides of photocatalyst.
First, dopant could hybrid with oxide of photocatalyst. Second, dopant could replace the
oxygen site and third, the addition of dopant in oxygen deficient site and oxygen sub-
stoichiometry, which acts as a blocker for reoxidation ( Rehman et al., 2009 ).Li et al. (2005)
noticed the formation of oxygen vacancy state due to the presence of nonmetal carbon
dopant due to the formation of Ti31species between the valence and the conduction bands
in the TiO 2band structure. Size of dopants is an important factor, which decides mode of
substitution of oxygen from photocatalyst. Guo et al. (2015b) showed that the smaller
radius species like C, N, or F substitute the O atom in the TiO 2terminate surface whereas,
larger radius species such as P, S, Cl, S, and Br replace the O in the SrO-terminated
surface.
Generally, oxides of photocatalyst and nonmetal dopants have approximately close
energy and, therefore, band gap of catalyst decreases and it becomes active in absorbing

duction band.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTvisible light ( Wang et al., 2012a ). Band gap engineering method also alters the morphol-
ogy, structure, electrical and optical properties of a semiconductor ( Mai et al., 2009 ), which
affects the light absorbance, charge-carrier mobility, redox potential, and surface area ( Hu
et al., 2011 ).Le et al. (2011) reported that incorporation of donor and acceptor species
directly affects electronic structure and in turn, reactivity of photocatalyst. The doping
reduces the band gap of photocatalyst, i.e. dispersion of the CB and VB of photocatalysts
shows a positive effect after doping. Such modification results in the red-shift of absorp-
tion spectra edge ( Yun et al., 2013 ). This type of bathochromic shift means a decrease in
band gap or an addition of intra band gap state due to doping resulting into the harnes-
sing of more photons from visible light. The addition of dopants in photocatalyst exhibits
enhanced performance because of the following reasons ( Ran et al., 2015 ):
it avoids electron-hole recombination,
provides enhanced surface area,
may lead to an increase in pore size of a sample,
high crystalline state,
and extends sensitivity towards a broad range of spectrum.
6.3.2 Codoping
Codoping involves different combinations of donor and acceptor species, which reduces
the band gap by raising the valence band edge and also by lowering the conduction band
edge. It helps in achieving activity towards a broad range of solar spectrum. Codoping of
both metal and nonmetal has also been reported in some cases ( Fig. 6.12 ).
Yan et al. (2013) found that like simple doping with a metal or nonmetal, this technique
also helps in solving issues like carrier recombination solubility limit, low carrier mobility,
and nonresponse to visible light in a host compound. Codoping with nonmetal/metal
such as C-Mo, N-W ( Folli et al., 2015 ), N-Nb ( Folli et al., 2016 ), N-Ta, and Ce-F enhances

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTthe efficiency but puts very little effect on the position of conduction band edges ( Liu,
2012).Huang et al. (2014) also reported that the combination of Ce and F affects the micro-
structure and optical band gap in Bi 2WO 6. Codoping with metal (Sm) and nonmetal (N)
reduces the crystal growth, recombination of charge carrier, and the transformation from
anatase to rutile phase ( Ma et al., 2010 ). Ga and Cu codoped ZnS synthesized by hydro-
thermal method possesses stability under a long duration of irradiation and exhibited 58
times higher efficiency than that of pure ZnS ( Kimi et al., 2015 ).
The N/F/anatase titania with {001} facets developed by hydrogel method, exhibited
improved performance as it increases a driving force of the electron. It further increases
the electron injection efficiency from LUMO of dye and conduction band of a semiconduc-
tor. Due to positive-shift flat band ( Yu et al., 2014 )(Fig. 6.13 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTNonmetal and plasmonic metal decorated titania showed photoresponse towards UV,
visible light, and direct sunlight, which makes it useful in elimination of various organic
compounds ( Zhang et al., 2011 ).Wang et al. (2009) used biomolecule l-cysteine as a com-
mon source of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur to prepare C-N-S-tridoped titanium dioxide
nanocrystals by hydrothermal method. Here, sulfur substituted oxygen, nitrogen existed
in bond with O and Ti as N-Ti-O and Ti-O-N, and carbon deposited on surface of titania
by forming a mixed layer of carbonate species. It was observed that biomolecule l-cysteine
also controlled the morphology and final crystal phases. C, N, S-Tridoped TiO 2exhibited
six times higher efficiency than pure and commercial photocatalyst ( Zhou and Yu, 2008 ).
6.3.3 Coupled Semiconductors or Composites
Composite formation, i.e. coupling of semiconductors, is another efficient method to
make semiconductors photoresponsive in the visible region of the spectrum.
Semiconductors that are chosen to prepare a composite must have variable band gaps.
A large band gap semiconductor is usually coupled with a small band gap semiconductor
having a more negative conduction band level. Consequently, the electrons in the conduc-
tion bands are inserted from the small band gap semiconductor to the large band gap
semiconductor.
Various combinations of photocatalyst have been coupled such as FeTiO 3/TiO 2,
Ag3PO4/TiO 2,W 18O49/TiO 2, CdS/TiO 2, CdSe/TiO 2, NiTiO 3/TiO 2, CoTiO 3/TiO 2,F e 2O3/
TiO 2(Rawal et al., 2013 ), ZnO/CdS, TiO 2/SnO 2(Liu et al. 2007 ), ZnO/TiO 2, and ZnO
/Ag 2S(Johar et al., 2015 ). Such composites give higher photocatalytic activity than single
ones due to the synergistic effect. It was reported that Cr 2O3coupled with SnO 2has been
found to exhibit superior photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation because of
good crystalline nanoparticles, smaller crystal size, and a stronger response to visible light.
The sample degrades 98% of rhodamine B in 60 min under irradiation of visible light
(Bhosale et al., 2013 ).
The photocalaytic activity can be further increased by doping coupled photocatalysts by
various combinations of metals and nonmetals. Samadi et al. (2015) codoped TiO 2and
SiO 2nanocomposite with Nd31and Zr41and observed the effect of dopant on distribution
and monotonous coating of TiO 2/SiO 2thin film. Doping creates uniform distribution of
particles with low agglomeration, and spongy microstructure. There is active decomposi-
tion of methyl orange due to reduction in charge recombination. Coupling may also
involve the modification of the surface of mesoporous SnO 2by other metal oxides such as
by metal oxides like TiO 2or Al 2O3.(Ramasamy and Lee, 2010 ).
6.3.4 Substitution
Another method to change activity of photocatalyst is by substitution of one metal
by another. Borse et al. (2012) reported the substitution of Ti41at the Fe41site in a
CaFe 2O4-MgFe 2O4bulk hetero-junction (BH) lattice photocatalyst and reported enhanced
photocurrent. The Ti ion doped sample also showed increased quantum yield for photode-
composition of H 2O-CH 3OH mixture due to efficient charge separation.149 6.3 MODIFICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTWang et al. (2012c) studied change in the band gap on substituting W metal in WO 3by
various metals such as Mo, Ti, Zr, and Hf. They reported that this substitution of W in
WO 3by another metal having the same valency such as Cr and Mo reduces the band gap
because of shifting of CB edge to the lower side. On the other hand, incorporation of metal
of lower valency such as Ti, Zr, and Hf lead to an increase in band gap due to shifting of
CB edge higher. The narrowing of band gap on substitution of O by S occurs due to for-
mation of localized occupied states above the VB and shifts the CB minimum upward—
two effects that go in the right direction ( Fig. 6.14 ).
Effect on band edge or electronic properties was also studied by Long et al. (2009) by
using Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb dopants. They observed that same dopant with different form i.e.
anatase or rutile gives different electronic property. Thus, different dopants may provide
the same effect on band gap. e.g. Si-, Ge doped, and Sn-; and Pb-doped rutile TiO 2shows
a decrease in band gap of about 0.1 with approximately 0.55 eV whereas, anatase form
reduces band gap by 0.20 and 0.15 eV and broadening by 0.06 and 0.02 eV, respectively.
6.3.5 Sensitization
Another promising method for surface modification of photocatalyst is sensitization.
Dyes or complexes can be used in photocatalytic systems, including solar cells due to their
redox properties and sensitivity towards visible light. On exposure to visible light, dyes or
complexes can inject electrons to the conduction band of the semiconductor so as to initi-
ate a catalytic reaction ( Fig. 6.15 ).
Sensitizers are organic and inorganic compounds that get adsorbed on the surface of
semiconductor by chemisorption or physisorption. The phenomenon of coating the surface
of a semiconductor by sensitizers is sensitization. Sensitizers act as antenna that absorb
light and transfer it to a semiconductor, which helps in improving the excitation process.
Sensitizers can be categorized on basis of the occurrence:
synthetic sensitizer
natural sensitizers
self sensitizer
FIGURE 6.14 Mechanism of electron transfer

Valentin, C.D., Pacchioni, G., 2012. J. Phys. Chem .C.
116 (16): 8901 /C08909. With permission.150 6. PHOTOCATALYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTSynthetic sensitizer includes commercial dyes like porphyrin dye ( Mathew et al., 2014 ),
Ru complexes ( Lee et al., 2013 ), Ru-polypyridyl-complex sensitizers, e.g., cis-dithiocyanato
bis(4,4’-dicarboxy-2,2’-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ( Hara and Koumura, 2009 ), quinoxaline-
based organic sensitizer ( Chang et al., 2011 ), etc.
The rate of photocatalysis depends on the sensitivity of the photocatalyst to light radia-
tions. In order to enhance the photosensitivity of the semiconductor some chemical sub-
stances having chromophores like dyes or natural pigments etc. could be used. These
chemical substances are called photosensitizers. A photosensitizer absorbs light and trans-
fers energy or electrons to the semiconductor. Dyes can be used in photocatalytic systems
and in solar cells due to their redox properties and sensitivity towards visible light. On
exposure to visible light, dyes can inject electrons to the conduction band of the semicon-
ductor so as to initiate a catalytic reaction.
Natural sensitizers such as Monascus red ( Lee et al., 2014 ),Pastinaca sativa ,Beta vulgaris
(Hemmatzadeh and Mohammadi, 2013 ), carotenoids, polyphenols ( Hug et al., 2014 ), chloro-
phyll ( Solanki et al., 2015a ) and its derivative ( Wang et al., 2010 ), anthocyanin ( Lee et al., 2013 ),
Festucaovina, Hibiscus sabdariffa, Tageteserecta, Bougainvillea spectabilis ,a n d Punicagranatum peel
(Herna ´ndez-Martı ´nez et al., 2012 ), strawberry and turmeric powder dyes ( Mohammed et al.,
2015) are extracted from seeds, leaves, flower petals, fruits, barks, etc., insects, animals, and
ores ( Venil et al., 2013 ); and therefore, natural sensitizers are also said natural dyes or pigment.
Performance depends on the type of natural pigment. Synthetic dyes are expensive so, natural
dyes are preferred over synthetic dyes as they are ( Narayan, 2012 ):
abundant raw material,
easy to extract,
low cost,
and eco-friendly.
These natural organic dyes are potential candidates to replace some of the man-made
dyes used as sensitizers ( Jasim, 2012 ). Natural pigments are photosensitizer because of
their structural and optical properties ( Alhamed et al., 2012 ).Kushwaha et al. (2013)
FIGURE 6.15 Role of a sensi-
tizer in photocatalysis.151 6.3 MODIFICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTisolated extract from the leaves of teak ( Tectona grandis ), tamarind ( Tamarindus indica ),
eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus globulus ), and the flower of crimson bottle brush ( Callistemon citri-
nus) and used it for enhancing visible light photosensitivity of dye based solar cells.
The natural dyes show less efficiency as compared to synthetic dyes. Improved effi-
ciency depends on various factors like ( Hemmatzadeh and Mohammadi, 2013 ):
method of extraction of dye,
the acidity of solvent used for extraction, and,
different compounds of solvents on the optical absorption spectra.
It was observed that a mixture of ethanol and water as an extracting solvent and also
the acidity of dye solution influence the performance and optical activity.
The natural dye not only accelerates the light absorption efficiency but it also increases
sustainability ( Hug et al., 2014 ), and electron transfer rate ( Rochkind et al., 2015; Solanki
et al., 2015b ).Benjamin et al. (2011) used extracts of natural pigments like chlorophyll and
anthocyanin to sensitize ZnO and used it for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes. It
was found that sensitization of photocatalyst by natural pigment reduces its band gap,
which leads to utilization of visible and infrared radiations more efficiently.
Flowering plants of order Caryophyllales contain nitrogen-containing betalain pigments
having desired light absorbing and antioxidant properties. These are used as coloring
agents or sensitizers. These are associated with various copigments, which are responsible
for changes in their light absorption properties. The carboxylic functional groups present
in pigments easily bind to the surface of photocatalyst like TiO 2(Herna ´ndez-Martı ´nez
et al., 2013 ).Saati et al. (2011) showed that the anthocyanin pigment extracted from red
rose flower petals is not only used as sensitizer in many dye sensitized solar cells, but it
also acts as an antioxidant to protect the fat content of fermented milk such as yogurt.
Sorghum red pigment (natural dye extracted from sorghum shell) showed maximum
absorption wavelength, and photostability of this pigment depends on the pH value
(Zhang et al., 2013 ). The extract from Saraca indica leaf serves as reducing agent in CuO
nanoparticles synthesis. This extract also acts as capping agent or stabilizing agent, which
stabilizes the catalyst. CuO nanoparticle synthesis by green pathway, i.e., by using extracts
ofS. indica help in determining size and morphology ( Prasad et al., 2017 ).
The natural dye molecules have a tendency to degrade in the presence of light, just like
other hazardous sensitizers. After degradation, it leaves no traces of organic species in
solution. Sensitizer degradation leads to deactivation of the supported catalyst, when it is
recovered. In such cases, the problem can be solved by retreatment of the recovered cata-
lysts with fresh dye ( Zyouds et al., 2011 ).
However, synthetic dyes show more efficiency than that of natural dyes. Synthetic dyes
are difficult to synthesize. They have a high cost, are toxic, and have less yield
(Okoli et al., 2012 ). On the other hand, natural dye extraction is easy, low cost, temperature
compatible, completely biodegradable, and nontoxic. But most of the sensitizers are sus-
ceptible to photocorrosion or degradation in aqueous solutions and therefore, are not
suitable for photocatalytic water treatment applications ( Pelaez et al., 2011 ). The quantum
dots, plasmonic metal nanostructures, and carbon nanostructures are also included in
synthetic photosensitizers, which are coupled with wide-band gap transition metal oxides
to design better visible-light active photocatalysts ( Chen and Wang, 2014 )(Fig. 6.16 ).152 6. PHOTOCATALYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIt has been noticed that semiconductors such as CdSe, CdTe, and CdS also act as self
sensitizers to sensitize other semiconductor TiO 2(Shen et al., 2015 ), SrTiO 3, BaTiO 3, and
CaTiO 3(Pan et al., 2015 ).
6.3.6 Miscellaneous
Titania is a perfect crystalline metal oxide with band gap greater than 3.1 eV. Such wide
band gap makes it active in the ultraviolet (UV) range, and it has a potential for clean
energy generation and environmental remediation. Yaghoubi et al. (2015) noticed the for-
mation of midgap-states-induced energy gap in titania when synthesizing it with solution-
phase method. The undoped mixed-phase TiO 2nanoparticles achieve the band gap of
about 2.2 eV and also possess oxygen vacancy and high surface area, accelerating its
photoreactivity.
6.3.6.1 Mechanism
The electron in valence band (VB) gets excited to conduction band (CB) on absorption
of a suitable wavelength of light. The gap between VB and CB is known as band gap.
Therefore, minimum energy required for excitation of an electron is equal to energy of
band gap. Thus, photocatalytic oxidation or reduction may be initiated by absorption of a
photon having energy equal to or more than the band gap of photocatalyst. Excitation of
an electron leads to formation of a pair of charge carriers (e22h1pair) on the surface of
photocatalyst, i.e. hole and electron in valence band and conduction band, respectively. At
this stage, there are two possibilities:
1.Charge carrier produced again recombine and release energy in the form of heat.
2.Charge carrier may react further with an electron donor or electron acceptor on the
photocatalyst surface.
In the first case, no reaction takes place. In the second case, electron or hole reacts with
dissolved oxygen or water to form O 22, HOOor OHfree radicals. These reactive oxidiz-
ing species along with other species like H 2O2and O 2play a major role in photooxidation
reaction ( Fig. 6.17 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT6.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Effluents from various sources like domestic, municipal, industrial, sludge, etc. consist
of many nonbiodegradable organic compounds, xenobiotic chemicals, oil, petroleum
waste, dyes, etc. An increase in industrialization has become a major source of pollution.
Particularly, chemical, textile, paper, pesticides, fertilizer industries, etc. discharge their
wastes in nearby water bodies without any primary treatment, which is a major reason for
making water polluted. Water pollution is emerging as a serious threat to the
environment.
Many conventional chemical, physical and biological methods like adsorption, sedimen-
tation, coagulation, filtration, chlorination, ozonation, reverse osmosis, UVC disinfection
activated sludge process, trickling filter, oxidation ditch, aerated lagoon, stabilization
ponds, etc. have been used since decades ( Pokharna and Shrivastava, 2013 ); but these are
not adequate and/or appropriate to treat wastewater streams on a large scale as these
require high capital investment, operation, maintenance cost, and a large area ( Amin et al.,
2014). Secondly, these methods do not degrade the effluents up to the desired extent that
it can be recycled, and also require analysis time in a number of days. Therefore, there is a
vital requirement for developing new hygienically friendly purification technologies.
Refinery wastewater consists of various concentrations of aliphatic and aromatic petro-
leum hydrocarbons, which are toxic and not possible to degrade by traditional treatment
methods. Petroleum refineries’ wastewater was treated using titania nanoparticles as the
photocatalyst in UV/TiO 2process by Saien and Shahrezaei (2012) .
Researchers have supported the technique of photocatalytic decomposition process to
degrade, decompose, eliminate the hazardous or nonhazardous hard-to-biodegrade
organic, inorganic, pollutants or contaminants in industrial wastewater before they are
released into mainstream water bodies. The photocatalytic decomposition process is also
FIGURE 6.17 Photocatalytic oxidation by photocatalyst under solar irradiation.154 6. PHOTOCATALYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTreferred as photocatalytic oxidation or photocatalysis. This method generates highly reac-
tive hydroxyl radicals, which oxidize the matter in solution and completely mineralize it
into water, CO 2and inorganic compounds ( Reza et al., 2015 ).
It is classified as an advanced oxidation process (AOP) and it is carried out with the
help of nanostructured metal oxides or sulfide semiconductors such as TiO 2, ZnO, SnO 2
(Song et al., 2014 )., SiO 2, CeO 2(Montini et al., 2016 ), ZnS ( Fang et al., 2011 ), MnS, CdS,
CuS, SrTiO 3, BaTiO 3, PbTiO 3(Piskunov et al., 2004 ), hematite ( α-Fe2O3), Bi 2WO 6(Rahimi
et al., 2016 ), etc. AOP is an effective technique for the oxidation of resistant pollutants,
such as phenolic compounds ( Elango et al., 2015 ).
The combination of photocatalyst and UV light has the potential to oxidize organic
pollutants or hazardous organic compounds into nontoxic or less harmful products, such
as CO 2and water ( Chatterjee and Dasgupta, 2005 ). It can also destroy certain microor-
ganisms i.e., bacteria and some viruses in the secondary wastewater treatment. Malato
et al. (2009) has excellently given other reviews including ours, and reviewed the decom-
position and degradation of wastewater co ntaminant, removal of toxic organic com-
pound, and disinfection of water. Sharma et al. (2010) utilized TiO 2photocatalyst in
combination, with ferrate [Fe(VI)] for many in dustrial applications, including the degra-
dation of recalcitrant contaminants in water and wastewater treatment. AOPs have
proved to be a cost efficient method for conversion of hazardous substances or contami-
nents, even if present in minute amount (ppm or ppb level) into benign components. It
also avoids harmful consequences of pollutants that are highly toxic, p ersistent, and dif-
ficult to treat ( Baruah et al., 2012 ).
6.4.1 Dye Degradation
Recently, photocatalysis has attracted the attention of the scientific community all over
the world for organic waste contaminant degradation, and also to solve or overcome the
issues related to energy and the environment ( Ibhadon and Fitzpatrick, 2013 )(Fig. 6.18 ).
Dye molecules have different structures and are very less or not biodegradable at all. The
elimination of dye molecules from wastewater requires the complete breakdown of the
conjugated unsaturated bonds in molecules ( Pinotti et al., 1997 ). The decontamination of
wastewater or degradation of dye contents by photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes
using photocatalyst has been proved to be an excellent method ( Gaya and Abdullah,
2008). Nanoparticles play a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis as they complete miner-
alize hazardous pollutants to harmless materials ( Yan et al., 2014 )(Fig. 6.18 ).
Major investigations have been carried out on photocatalytic degradation of organic
pollutant by using TiO 2(Ohko et al., 1997 ). The nanocomposite of titania and carbon nano-
tube (CNT) shows an increase in degradation efficiency for methylene blue because CNT
avoids the agglomeration of titania and thus, increases the surface area. Further, it leads to
electron transfer in the composites ( Wongaree et al., 2015 ). The nanocomposite absorbs
light and creates a hole in CNT and transfers electrons to CB of titania. The positively
charged hole reacts with a water molecule to produce OH ions andOH radicals.
Simultaneously, photocatalyst reacts with dissolved oxygen to generate O 22radical ions
that are able to degrade methylene blue ( Fig. 6.19 ).155 6.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe rate of photodegradation depends on the kind of photocatalytic surface. Smirnova et al.
(2015) investigated two pathways for photodegradation of acridine yellow and these are:
1.Fast rate of photodegradation : When decomposition occurs on the surface of TiO 2and
TiO 2/SiO 2, then the half time of degradation has been reported to be 4 and 15 min,
respectively.
2.Slow rate of photodegradation : It involves half time of more than 90 min, when reaction
oxidation of protonated via amino group acridine yellow on silica surface is in the air.
They observed that degradation of acridine yellow on the surfaces of mesoporous TiO 2,
SiO 2,and TiO 2/SiO 2films take place in the following trend under UV irradiation:
SiO 2,TiO 2=SiO 2,TiO 2
Luna-Flores et al. (2017) incorporated sensitizer zinc phthalocyanine in commercial
TiO 2material and observed changes in optical and structural property. The synergetic
effect of sensitizer and photocatalyst accelerates the electron injection into the semiconduc-
tor and simultaneously, it prevents the back electron transfer, i.e., recombination of the
charge carrier. Sensitized semiconductor exhibited better degradation of rhodamine B
under visible light irradiation than that of bare or unsensitized semiconductor. The toxicity
of wastewater was also examined by the inhibitory effect on the sprouting of chia seeds
(Salvia hispanica ). They showed that byproducs formed by degradation of dye products do
not lead to an acute toxicity ( Fig. 6.20 ).
The industrial solvent trichloroethylene is a polar and toxic chemical that adversely
affects the soil, surface of water, and also ground water. Bak et al. (2015) used nano-ZnO-
laponite porous balls with 20% porosity for the elimination of trichloroethylene. Removal
occurs due to generation of hydroxide by photons.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIt is not always that the addition or substitution of dopant results in a decrease in band
gap. Band gap may also increase in some cases, because of increase in particle size, which
can be explained by the quantum confinement effect. The ZnS has band gap of 3.21 eV,
which is increased by 0.21 eV i.e., 3.42 eV after being doped with Ag nanoparticles. ZnS-
Ag nanoballs (doped) degraded organic dye methylene blue more effectively in compari-
son to the bare ZnS ( Sivakumar et al., 2014 ). Cationic dye crystal violet was degraded by
ZnO nanoparticles under visible irradiation ( Habib et al., 2013 ).
According to them, dye contents are very sensitive to visible light. Therefore, on expos-
ing it to light in the presence of a photocatalyst, electron transfer process occurs between
dye and photocatalyst (semiconductor or SC).
Firstly, dye molecule adsorbed on SC get excited by absorption of light.
Then, excited dye transfers its electron in CB of SC.
This excited electron reacts with O 2(dissolved oxygen) to form active oxygen anion
radicals.
On excitation of photocatalyst, electron-hole pair formation takes place, which is
responsible for production ofOH, HO 2,H2O2, and also O2reactive oxygen species.
These active species react with dye to degrade or mineralize it.
Ali et al. (2013) reported the reaction of a hole with a hydroxide ion and water molecule
to generate a stronger oxidizing agent,OH radical, which will assist in removal of organic
pollutants from wastewater.

Vattikuti and Byon (2016) used hydrothermal method for coating molybdenum disul-
fide nanospheres on monodispersed Al 2O3. The core shell structure influences removal of
water pollutant rhodamine B and enhances the chemical stability.
SnO 2has excellent properties like mechanical hardness, uniformity, low resistivity, sta-
bility to heat treatment, optical transmittance, and piezoelectric behavior ( Ali and
Tajammul, 2013 ).Lin et al. (2017) reported that this photocatalyst can be synthesized in
various shapes like nanorods, nanotubes, nanosheets, nanowires and so on. They form
microflower three dimensional SnO 2hierarchical nanostructures by hydrothermal method
and exhibited good performance in wastewater purification. Panchal et al. (2014) carried
out the photocatalytic degradation of erythrosine-B using semiconductor SnO 2under visi-
ble irradiation. The effect of different parameters like pH, concentration of dye, amount of
photocatalyst and light intensity on the rate of photodegradation of dye was observed and
optimal conditions were obtained.

method. Quantum dot SnO 2lead to a blue shift in the band gap energy, i.e., 4.5 eV and
was employed as photocatalyst in the degradation of an organic dye, eosin Y, by solar irra-
diation. Coupled ZnO/SnO 2nanocomposites were prepared by using coprecipitation
method by Tanasa et al. (2013) . They used different molar ratios of 1:10, 1:2, 2:1, and 10:1
and observed that the presence of ZnO in SnO 2improves its performance under UV158 6. PHOTOCATALYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTirradiation. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was tested by examining the eosin Y
degradation from wastewaters. Different parameters such as crystallite size, surface area,
absorption edge, TOC values, time of reaction, and catalyst concentration were also taken
into consideration. Similarly, improved efficiency was observed for SnO 2/CNTs nanocom-
posites ( Wang et al., 2012b ), because the electron generated by photon absorption showed
separately transferring to the CNx, has a high degree of defects. Hence, the radiative
recombination of the charge carrier was hampered and the photocatalytic activity pre-
sented significant enhancement for the SnO 2/CNx photocatalysts.
pH is one of the crucial factors as the acidic or basic condition of solution decides the
rate of degradation. It is so because pH affects the charge on the surface of metal oxide
(Ghaly et al., 2011 ). Surface area is a core deciding factor for performance of a photocata-
lyst. As number of active site increases on increasing surface area; resulting into decrease
in electron-hole recombination rate. As a consequence, photocatalytic activity is enhanced.
The dye degradation is observed at absorption maximum of dye by observing change in
the rate of decolorization with respect to the intensity of absorption peak in visible region.
At this wavelength, dye decolorizes gradually and finally color disappears, which shows
the complete degradation of dye ( Kansal et al., 2009, Kalsoom et al., 2013 ). The degrada-
tion of textile dyes forms formate, acetate, and oxalate as dominant aliphatic intermediate
whereas nitrate, sulfate, and chloride anions form after complete mineralization
(Mahmoodi, 2014 ). The effluents also have various ions like SO 422,C l2,N O 32,C H 3COO2,
HCO 32, and H 2PO42and they impart major influence on photocatalytic degradation. The
anions like SO 422, and Cl2were found to accelerate the rate, but the presence of
CH 3COO2, HCO 32, and H 2PO42adversely affects the rate of degradation ( Alahiane et al.,
2014).
6.4.2 Antimicrobial Activity
Wastewater may also contain some harmful microorganisms along with organic pollu-
tants. Photocatalysts support the destruction of such microrganisms ( Benabbou et al.,
2007) like bacteria, virus, and fungi, and it can also decompose the cell itself. Toxin is
released after killing of the cell. This released toxin also gets decomposed by photocataly-
tic action ( Liou and Chang, 2012 ).Sangchay (2017) synthesized WO 3-doped TiO 2coating
on charcoal, activated through microwave-assisted sol-gel method. They observed
enhanced photocatalyic activity in degradation of methylene blue solution and also against
the bacteria E. coli .1 %W O 3-doped TiO 2coated activated charcoal exhibited excellent anti-
microbial activity as compared to pure titania.
The aqueous solution, having Giardia lamblia, has been sterilized by titania under UV-
irradiation ( Lee et al., 2004 ). Adhesion of photocatalyst on surface of substrate assists in
photocatalytic decomposition of acid orange 7, along with microorganisms like bacteria
E. coli (E. Coli) and viruses like Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) ( Hajkova et al., 2007 ). The
pure titanium dioxide and Ag modified TiO 2nanocomposite were applied for disinfection
ofBacillus atrophaeus (Lee et al., 2011 ). BiOBr photocatalyst also degrades the organic pol-
lutant, and bacterial infection leading to detoxification and disinfection of water ( Ahmad
et al., 2016 ).159 6.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT6.4.3 Organic Pollutants Elimination
Photocatalyst alone is not the only factor, which is responsible for removal or degrada-
tion of aqueous pollutants. With the presence of an electron acceptor, i.e. molecular oxy-
gen, phenol red was 60% bleached only whereas in presence of hydrogen peroxide, it
undergoes more than 90% degradation under visible light. Temperature is also an impor-
tant factor, which influences the photodegradation of organic pollutants ( Wahab and
Hussain, 2016 ). Oxidants have an important role in degradation of an organic pollutant.
Sohrabi and Akhlaghian (2016) observed 18.26% degradation of phenol whereas, 27.87%
decomposition was there with the proper amount of H 2O2using iron-modified titanium
dioxide, i.e., Fe 2O3/TiO 2. They also reported an adverse effect of temperature, if it is more
than room temperature.
Removal for substituted phenols has been studied using metal oxides like TiO 2or ZnO,
but the major problem is to separate the catalyst from the solution ( Ahmed et al., 2010 ).
Cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2O4) is a semiconductor with magnetic property and narrow band gap
and therefore, it can be easily isolated from a solution by applying an external magnetic
field ( Golsefidi et al., 2016 ).Zeynolabedin and Mahanpoor (2017) observed 96% degrada-
tion of water pollutant 2-nitrophenol by using Cu slag supported CoFe 2O4. The dechlori-
nation of 2,4-dichlorophenol by N-TiO 2releases chlorine as chloride ions under irradiation
of visible light ( Gionco et al., 2016 ). The complete dechlorination takes 2 h with doped cat-
alyst, whereas bare ZnO takes about 3 h.
Furfural is an organic compound that is used as a solvent in petrochemical installations,
oil refineries, and other chemical industrial plants to separate hydrocarbon. It is nonbiode-
gradable, highly resistant, and has a slow degradation rate. Therefore, it is an important
source of water pollution ( Borghei and Hosseini, 2008 ). Furfural in wastewater has a major
adverse impact on living organisms. It gets adsorbed into the skin, and exerts a negative
effect on the nervous system, destroys cell membranes, and inhibits the metabolism
(Ghosh et al., 2010; Mousavi-Mortazavi and Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh, 2016; Cuevas et al., 2014;
Manz et al., 2016 ). It is toxic in nature, and hence, makes its degradation, mineralization,
and removal from effluent essential.
Granular activated carbon is porous and posseses a low density. Titania supported on
granular activated carbon was synthesized by simple sol-gel method, which has total pore
volume and a specific surface area of 0.13 cm3/g and 35.91 m2/g, respectively. It shows
degradation of furfural of about 95% within 80 min and it can be reused for a minimum of
4 times with only 2% reduction in furfural removal efficiency ( Ghasemi et al., 2016 ). The
total pore volume of a composite is lesser than the supporter GAC and therefore, titania
gets completely embedded in pores of the supporter ( Table 6.2 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTLee et al. (2015) studied photocatalytic degradation of phenoxyacetic acid (PAA) by
redox reaction. The photooxidation of ethanol by vanadium doped TiO 2photocatalyst
gives carbon dioxide as a major product and acetaldehyde, formic acid, and carbon mon-
oxide as side products under visible irradiation ( Klosek and Raftery, 2001 ).
6.4.4 Removal of Heavy Metal
Samadi et al. (2014) reported immobilization of Cu-titania/chitosan on polycarbonate
substrate. The immobilized thin film was reliable, reproducible, and inexpensive to syn-
thesize by simple sol-gel method. It showed excellent performance for the removal of hea-
vy metal such as Pb21and Cr61from aqueous media. Thus, immobilization of a catalyst
by various means provides a solution to problems of separation, recycling, and
deactivation.
The maghemite ( γ-Fe2O3) and titanium oxide were prepared by hydrothermal and
coprecipitation process. These were then mixed in 1:10, 1:20, 1:60, 1:80, and 1:100 ratios
and covered by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-alginate beads. The enclosed composite removes
toxic metal, Pb(II) to the extent of 100% from the aqueous solution in 100 min at neutral
condition under sunlight ( Majidnia and Idris, 2016 ).
6.4.5 Degradation of Oil in Wastewater
Oil spills are the biggest untold nonbiodegradable hazardous factor that pollute the
water and disturb whole ecosystems of water bodies. Photocatalytic processes may rapidly
degrade crude oil or other hydrocarbon containments released from petroleum and oil
refineries. It is a low cost and fast technique to convert the contaminants in water, carbon
dioxide, and biodegradable organics. Thus, it has wide applications in remediating oil pol-
lution near the seashore, in the middle of the ocean, at a refinery, or at a water cleaning
facility.
Ziolli, Jardim (2002) reported that crude oil compounds in contaminated waters do not
mineralize by photolysis but by heterogeneous photocatalytic processes; their degradation
is around 90%. Titania in anatase form is proved to be best for oil spill remediation
(Narayan, 2010 ). Total organic carbon (TOC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
in oil sludge were eliminated by heterogeneous photocatalysis using titanium dioxide in
the presence of hydrogen peroxide under solar radiation ( Topare et al., 2015 ). Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons get completely eliminated in 96 h, and 91% reduction of total
organic carbon in 144 h using 5 mg of TiO 2(Rocha et al., 2014 ). Photo-Fenton homoge-
neous and heterogeneous systems in the presence of H 2O2,treat oily wastewater more
effectively as compared to a system without Fenton ( Mustafa et al., 2014 ).
Photocatalysis break down the hydrocarbon spill into oil, leaving only biodegradable
compounds behind. Yeber et al. (2012) used bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa based titania
film for removal of oil (99%) and total organic carbon (TOC mg/L) (78.6%). The biodegr-
ability of oily wastewater from the restaurant was enhanced on treatment TiO 2oxidation
system in the presence of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 185 nm) ( Kang et al., 2010 ).161 6.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTToluene represents the aromatics in the oil spill, which are decomposed by N doped
TiO 2nanotube thin film coated onto a levee at the water surface level ( Hsu et al., 2008 ).
Maghemite nanoparticles ( γ-Fe2O3) prepared by precipitation method showed 90% toluene
elimination from sea water in 2 h under sunlight ( Roushenas et al., 2014 ).
6.5 IMMOBILIZATION
The use of titania has limitations such as that it cannot be recollected or separated from
water, but immobilization of TiO 2can solve this problem. The introduction of silane cou-
pling agents that silylate the titanium dioxide nanotube improves its surface property.
Grafting it on the surface of polyurethane (PU) membrane helps in immobilization of semi-
conductors. It’s not easy to separate photocatalysts after treatment of wastewater, but it also
provides high activation and catalytic performance for degradation of methyl orange. It is
found stable for a longer time, if the catalyst is washed with ethanol ( Lin et al., 2017 ). It is
interesting to note that immobilized PU/TiO 2sustains stable photocatalytic properties, even
if reused many times with no significant loss of catalyst ( Fig. 6.21 )

PU/titania after use. Adapted from Lin, L., Wu, Q., Gong, X., Zhang, Y., 2017. J. Anal. Methods Chem. doi.org/10.1155/

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTTitanium dioxide nanoparticles were synthesized though the hydrolysis and condensa-
tion of titanium tetrachloride by Nyamukamba et al. (2016) . These were further localized
on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and were heated to convert:
polymer nanofibers to carbon nanofibers, and
amorphous TiO 2to crystalline TiO 2.
The immobilized photocatalyst was able to degrade organic contaminants in water. The
degradation was approximately 60% in 210 min because of direct contact among the TiO 2
photocatalyst and methyl orange.
The reusability of photocatalyst is an important factor for its industrial use as it reduces
its cost and increases the availibilty and reliability for photoctalysis and environmental
safety by limiting the disposal of secondary pollutants into the environment. In order to
ascertain the reusability of photocatalyst materials, it could be immobilized or can be pro-
vided magnetic property ( Fig. 6.22 ).
Composite photocatalysts NiFe 2O4-SiO 2,N i F e 2O4-TiO 2,N i F e 2O4-SiO 2-TiO 2, and TiO 2with
various magnetic properties have a great application in elimination of contaminants. The

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTreduction efficiency for Cr(VI) in aqueous solution was observed to be higher for NiFe 2O4-
SiO 2-TiO 2than in magnetic titanium dioxide without silica interlayer NiFe 2O4-TiO 2.T h e
order of reduction of contaminants was observed as follows ( Ojemaye et al., 2017 ):
TiO 2 . NiFe 2O4-SiO 2-TiO 2. NiFe 2O4-TiO 2
(96.7% in 240 min) (96.5% 300 min) (60% in 300 min)
Although it was observed that titania shows slightly more efficiency but it is associated
with recovery problem. But NiFe 2O4-SiO 2-TiO 2has less activity (0.2% less) due to the pres-
ence of interlayer of silica between the magnetic core and photocatalyst such as titanium diox-
ide, but it also makes the recovery of photocatalyst easier because of its magnetic property.
6.6 EFFECT OF MORPHOLOGY
Chen et al. (2015) synthesized TiO 2/stellerite composite by scattering TiO 2on the sur-
face of stellerite treated by HCl, NaOH, or NaCl via sol-gel method. It was observed that
the HCl and NaCl increased the degradation efficiency of methyl orange due to pore for-
mation at the satellite surface, and also induces the microscopic changes whereas, NaOH
decreases the activity of photocatalyst by distorting the morphology of stellerite due to for-
mation of silicates ( Fig. 6.23 ).
FIGURE 6.23 Dealuminization and desilication of stellerites. Adapted from Chen, H., Wang, J., Wang, H., Yang,
F., Zhou, J.N., Fu, J., Yang, J., Yuan, Z., Zheng, B., 2015. J. Nanomter. doi:10.1155/2015/7015-89. With permission.164 6. PHOTOCATALYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe performance of the semiconductor gets influenced by the structure of co-catalyst
added. The preferential Pt(111) nanoparticles supported on TiO 2shows 1.6 times higher
efficiency than polyoriented Pt supported TiO 2. It is due to variation in the count of sur-
face atoms at corners and edges between the Pt(poly) and Pt(111) nanoparticles. The pref-
erential Pt(111) nanoparticles enhance the transfer efficiency of photo-induced electrons
from the conduction band of TiO 2to Pt nanoparticles. Thus, the surface structure of Pt
decides the performance of the semiconductor ( Cui et al., 2016 ).
6.7 OTHER APPLICATIONS
Photocatalysts are very versalite materials because of their attractive properties such as
optical transmittance, uniformity, low resistivity, mechanical hardness, stability to heat
treatment, hydrophobic and piezoelectric behavior. Therefore, they become a
suitable candidate for devices such as for gas sensor application, Li-ion batteries, photovol-
taic, super capacitor, light emitting diode, display devices and solar cell ( Birkel et al., 2012;
Ali and Tajammul, 2013 ), (Kumara et al., 2013 ), DSSCs electrochemical water splitting
(Swierk et al., 2015 ), antibacterial ( Joost et al., 2015 ), antifogging ( Takagi et al., 2001 ), self
cleaning ( Banerjee et al., 2015 ), etc.
Photocatalysis is the most widely used field of green chemistry as it uses light, which is
freely available and does not pollute the atmosphere. Many chemical and physical pro-
cesses are used in wastewater treatment, but photocatalytic treatment of organic pollutants
present in wastewater has proved to one of the most efficient and ecofriendly techniques.
Other methods either produce secondary pollutants or release harmful compounds in the
environment, while photocatalytic remediation of wastewater is a step towards clean
chemistry and it is one of the most important advanced oxidation processes. Time is not
far off, when photocatalysis will prove its worth and will find a dominant position in the
treatment of wastewaters in years to come.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Since the early 20th century, the ultrasound has gained considerable attention due to
the enhancement of chemical and physical effects in many processes. In the 1930s, it was
discovered that sonication induces polymers degradation ( Thompson and Doraiswamy,
1999). The first experimental evidence for the formation of hydroxyl radicals in aqueous
solution was reported by Parke and Taylor (1956) . Spin trapping techniques allowed for
verification of the formation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals from water sonication
(Makino et al., 1982 ). Then the “hot spot” theory was proposed to explain the thermal and
radical phenomena promoted by ultrasound. This theory was widely accepted and conse-
quently, the proliferation of ultrasound applications to the removal of organic pollutants
from water considerably increased ( Thompson and Doraiswamy, 1999 ).
Due to the ability to produce radical species (mainly hydroxyl radical,OH) that pro-
mote the degradation of refractory substances in water, ultrasound was considered an
advanced oxidation process (AOP). Currently, this process is an alternative AOP with
potential to eliminate chemical and microbiological pollutants in wastewaters as a tertiary
treatment technology. Ultrasound has unique advantages compared to other AOPs, such
as no addition of reagents, ease in handling, and differential or selective degradation
according to the pollutant nature ( Xiao et al., 2014b ). Owing the interesting perspectives of
sonochemistry applied to water treatment, this chapter presents fundamental and applica-
tive aspects of water remediation using ultrasound.
7.2 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCESS
Ultrasound refers to sound waves with frequencies above the detected by human ear. It
is ranged from 20 /C010,000 kHz. Typically, ultrasound is divided into three regions

sound frequencies are used in chemical processes, whereas very high frequency is applied
in medical diagnostics.
When high-intensity ultrasound waves interact with dissolved gases in liquid medium,
it is promoted acoustic cavitation (i.e., the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of
bubbles) ( Suslick and Fang, 1999 ). Ultrasound waves consist of compression and expan-
sion cycles. During the expansion, waves having the sufficient intensity to exceed the
molecular forces of liquid generate bubbles. These bubbles continually absorb energy from
alternating compression and expansion ultrasound cycles. Thus, bubbles grow (by diffu-
sion of vapor or gas from liquid medium) until they reach a critical size and then collapse
(Fig. 7.1 )(Suslick and Fang, 1999 ).
The bubble collapse acts as a localized “hot spot” with singular conditions of tempera-
ture (B5000K), pressure ( B1000 atm), and short-life. Hence, chemical processes (bond

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcleavage) occur; e.g., molecules of water and gases are broken (sonochemistry). Water is
decomposed into a hydrogen atom and hydroxyl radical ( Eq. 7.1 ). Oxygen and nitrogen
produces atomic species ( Eqs. 7.2 and 7.3 ), and volatile organic substances in the system
are pyrolyzed. Additionally, some reactions of radicals occur ( Eqs. 7.4 /C07.11)(Adewuyi,
2001). Sonochemistry is often accompanied by emission of light, and this phenomenon is
called sonoluminescence ( Suslick 1989; Suslick and Fang, 1999 ).

The sonochemical process is rationalized as a three zones system: (1) bulk of solution,
(2) interface of cavitation bubble, and (3) inner of bubble ( Fig. 7.2 ). The hydrophilic sub-
stances are placed in the bulk of the solution, hydrophobic nonvolatile compounds accu-
mulate in the interfacial zone, while volatile substances enter the cavitation bubble
(Gogate, 2008 ). Thus, the nature of a pollutant determines its degradation route in the
FIGURE 7.2 Zones of sonochemical system, where pollutants are degraded (inner of bubble, interface,
and solution bulk). Adapted from Adewuyi, Y.G., 2001. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 40, 4681 /C04715. With permission.179 7.2 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCESS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsonochemical process. The removal of those hydrophilic compounds is promoted by
hydroxyl radicals that reach the solution bulk after bubble collapse. Hydrophobic nonvol-
atile compounds are eliminated in the interfacial zone by radical attacks and/or thermal
reactions. In its turn, volatile pollutants are pyrolyzed inside of bubbles ( Fig. 7.2 )(Pe´trier
and Francony, 1997 ).
On the other hand, the degradation of several pollutants under ultrasound action fol-
lows a pseudo-first order of reaction. Therefore, the rate of removal (r) is expressed as:
r52 dC=dt5kC (7.12)
where C is the concentration of the pollutant and k is the pseudo-first order constant. The
integration of Eq. (7.12) leads to Eq. (7.13) .
lnðC=CiÞ5kt (7.13)
where C iis the initial pollutant concentration and t is the treatment time. Thus, the k
value can be determined as the slope from the plot of ln(C/C i) versus t, using the experi-
mental data. Furthermore, the kinetics of sonochemical degradation can be modeled
taking into account variations on the initial concentration and nature of the pollutant
(see Section 7.4.5 ).
7.3 TYPES OF MAIN REACTORS (REACTION SYSTEMS)
Bath and probe (also called horn) are the two most common reaction systems for the
generation of acoustic cavitation in water ( Fig. 7.3 ). Ultrasound is introduced into a system
by direct contact of the ultrasonic source with the liquid medium (direct sonication) or by
dipping a vessel containing the solution to treat (indirect sonication). In either case, the
ultrasound waves are generated through a piece that incorporates a transducer (the part of
system that transforms electrical power into waves) coupled to a vibrating plate for the
bath and a tip for the probe. Additionally, all systems should be equipped with a cooler/
heater device to stabilize the bulk solution temperature ( Berlan and Mason 1992;
Sathishkumar et al., 2016 ).
From the two main systems (i.e., bath and probe), diverse configurations (by modifica-
tion of the amount and positions of ultrasonic wave sources) and geometries of reactors
have been developed. Also, different modes (batch or continuous flow) of the ultrasonic
reaction systems have been considered ( Mason, 2001; Sutkar and Gogate, 2009 ).
Supplementary information about design aspects of sonochemical reactors, advantages,
and limitations of the diverse systems can be found in the references ( Berlan and Mason,
1992; Gogate, 2008; Sutkar and Gogate, 2009; Sathishkumar et al., 2016 ).
On the other hand, two ultrasound irradiation ways (i.e., continuous or pulsed) are
possible. Continuous way is the most frequently used. However, pulsed wave ultrasound
has been gaining attention because it can enhance elimination of pollutants (mainly hydro-
phobic substances) by increasing their accumulation on bubble interface during the inter-
vals between pulses, causing more molecule degradation during the collapse ( Xiao et al.
2013, 2014b ).180 7. SONOLYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT7.4 THE EFFECT OF SONOCHEMICAL OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS
In addition to the reaction system (type, design, irradiation way, etc.), sonochemistry
and its application to water remediation also depends on operational parameters such as
the ultrasonic frequency, dissolved gases, acoustic power, temperature of the liquid, and
the initial concentration of the pollutant.
7.4.1 Ultrasound Frequency
The ultrasonic frequency affects the cavitation process by modifying the bubble size
and collapse time of the cavity. The increase of frequency makes the collapse time shorter
and the bubble size smaller ( Fig. 7.4 )(Lim et al., 2011 ). A higher frequency induces more
cavitation events per time unit, and the flux of gases and volatile substances toward the
bubble is increased ( Beckett and Hua, 2001; Yang et al., 2008 ). However, the highest radi-
cals formation occurs at frequencies around 200 /C0350 kHz ( Kang et al., 1999 ).
Consequently, a larger accumulation of hydrogen peroxide coming from the combination
of radicals ( Eq. 7.7, 7.10 /C07.11) is observed at these frequencies ( Table 7.2 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTHowever, the effect of frequency in the degradation depends on the contaminant
nature. For hydrophilic and moderate hydrophobic substances (e.g., coomassie brilliant
blue and phenol), their major removals are coincident with the range of high hydroxyl
radical formation (i.e., 200 /C0350 kHz), whereas the degradation of very hydrophobic or vol-
atile substances (e.g., octyl-benzenesulfonate and carbon tetrachloride) is more favored at
higher values of frequency ( Table 7.2 ).
The ultrasonic treatment of phenol and CCl 4in the range 20 /C0800 kHz showed that the
former is faster degraded at 200 kHz, while the carbon tetrachloride disappearance is
enhanced on increasing frequency. As the CCl 4degradation takes place inside of the cavi-
tation bubble, its removal is favored with the increasing frequency because the flux of this
volatile substance toward the bubble and the number of cavitation collapses are greater at
higher frequencies. In contrast, phenol is degraded by attacks of hydroxyl radical (out of
cavitation bubbles), thus, its elimination is faster at the frequency of higher production of
OH ( Pe´trier and Francony, 1997 ).
Additional information about physical principles of ultrasound frequency effects
can be found in the literature ( Beckett and Hua, 2001; Brotchie et al., 2009; Merouani
et al., 2013 ).
7.4.2 Dissolved Gas
The properties of dissolved gases, such as their ratio of specific heats ( γ, also named
polytropic index), thermal conductivity (Q), and solubility in water, influence the
FIGURE 7.4 Effect of frequency on both the time of cavity collapse ( τcollapse ) and the maximum radius of cavita-
tion bubble (R max).Adapted from Lim, M., Son, Y., Karim, J., 2011. Ultrasonics Sonochem. 18, 460 /C0465. With permission.182 7. SONOLYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsonochemical activity ( Hua and Hoffmann, 1997 ).Table 7.3 presents the γand Q values
for the commonly used gases in sonochemical processes. The first property is related to
the maximum implosion temperature, while the second property determines the rate of
heat transfer to the surrounding liquid ( Adewuyi, 2001; Rooze et al., 2013 ). Hence, the
gases with high γand low Q values favor a high temperature during the implosion of cav-
itation bubbles. Additionally, a higher gas solubility provides more nucleation sites for
cavitation, leading to a higher number of bubbles in the medium ( Hua and Hoffmann,
1997; Merouani et al., 2015 ).
Typically air, oxygen, and noble gases (mainly helium, argon, and krypton) have been
used in sonochemistry. Air or oxygen, as dissolved gases, produce additional radicals
from interaction of O 2with H(Eq. 7.4 )o rO with H 2O(Eq. 7.5 ). Furthermore, the forma-
tion of hydroxyl radicals using oxygen is higher than when air is the saturating gas. For
nonvolatile pollutants, the degradation and the production of H 2O2in the presence ofTABLE 7.2 Effect of Ultrasonic Frequency During Sonochemical Treatment of Organic Pollutants

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENToxygen are faster than when air is used. This can be also associated to the higher solubility
of O 2(Table 7.3 ).
For noble gases such as helium, argon, and krypton, the production of hydroxyl radical
in water follows the order: Kr .Ar.He (Hua and Hoffmann, 1997 ), which is reflected on
the degradation of pollutants. This is because krypton and argon gases have larger specific
heat ratios and solubility, and lower thermal conductivities than helium ( Lifka et al.,
2003 ). For example, the comparative treatment of the pharmaceutical fluoxetine at 600 kHz
using He and Ar as dissolved gases showed that both the pollutant degradation and H 2O2
accumulation in argon are significantly higher than in helium presence ( Fig. 7.5 ). Similar
results have been reported in the case of p-nitrophenyl acetate, where its sonochemical
degradation was faster in Ar than in He ( Lifka et al., 2003; Hua et al., 1995 ).
On the other hand, several works have compared the degradation of pollutants in the
presence of air and argon. The ratio between rate constants or initial rates (denoted as
kair/kAr) for different compounds is presented in Table 7.4 . A value of k air/kArhigher
than one indicates that pollutant removal is better in air, whereas a ratio lower than one
shows that degradation in argon is favored. Merouani et al. (2015) studied the effect of fre-
quency on the rate ofOH formation for argon and air in the range 200 /C01200 kHz. They
found that at frequencies above 500 kHz, hydroxyl radical is produced faster in argon;
whereas at frequencies below 500 kHz, theOH formation rate is higher in air.
From Table 7.4 , it can be observed that hydrophilic (e.g., tannic acid, gallic acid, crystal
violet) or moderate hydrophobic substances (e.g., bisphenol-A, ibuprofen, fluoxetine),
which are susceptible to be degraded byOH in the bulk of solution or bubble interface,
show a faster degradation at 200 /C0400 kHz range using air as dissolved gas, or under the
argon at higher frequencies (500 /C0800 kHz). This is associated to the larger production of
hydroxyl radical in such conditions. Otherwise, high hydrophobic or volatile substances
(e.g., pentachlorophenol, PFOS, PFOA, alachlor, trichloroethylene, etc.) are faster degraded
in argon, which is related with the fact that Ar has stronger thermal effects than air at
200/C01100 kHz frequency range ( Merouani et al., 2015 ).
In addition to air, oxygen, helium, argon, and krypton as saturating gases, nitrogen and
carbon dioxide or mixtures of oxygen and argon have been considered. N 2gas promotesTABLE 7.3 Properties of Commonly Used Gases in the Sonochemical

(Eqs. 7.8 and 7.9 ) inducing the formation of HNO 2(Mead et al., 1976 ) and this can
decrease the efficiency of removal of contaminants. Meanwhile, the absence of cavitation
under CO 2saturated conditions, due to its low solubility, hinders the degradation of pol-
lutants ( Henglein and Gutierrez, 1988; Guzman-Duque et al., 2011 ). In contrast, the use of
argon/oxygen mixtures (such as Ar/O 2: 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 75/25, and 60/40) improves
the degradation of organic compounds ( Hart and Henglein, 1985; Henglein and Gutierrez,
1988; Schramm and Hua 2001; Beckett and Hua, 2000 ). Further information about these
topics can be found in literature ( Beckett and Hua, 2000; Schramm and Hua 2001; Rooze
et al., 2013; Guzman-Duque et al., 2011; Mead et al., 1976; Hart and Henglein, 1985;
Henglein and Gutierrez, 1988 ).
7.4.3 Power Input
The power is the energy emitted by the source (vibrating plate or probe) in the form of
ultrasound waves ( Adewuyi, 2001 ). Sometimes, this parameter is divided by the solution
volume to indicate the power density ( Lifka et al., 2003 ). The increase in the ultrasonic
power induces more sonochemical activity in the liquid medium. For all kinds of
substances (volatiles, hydrophobics, and hydrophilics), the response to the effect of the
ultrasonic power is similar ( Table 7.5 ).
A higher input power leads to a faster deg radation of the pollutants due to more
cavitation events and hydroxyl radical pr oduction, which is evidenced by a greater
accumulation of H 2O2, when the power is augmented ( Fig. 7.6 ). However, it is impor-
tant to remark that after a cert ain value, an improvement in the pollutant degradation is
not possible with the increasing of the ultrasonic power ( Lifka et al., 2003; Tezcanli-
Guyer and Ince, 2003 ). This is due to the fact that cavitation bubble size increases
with ultrasound power; however, after a lim it value the bubble radius is approximately
constant ( Brotchie et al., 2009 ).
7.4.4 Effect of Bulk Temperature
The maximum temperature generated during the bubble collapse depends on the liquid
bulk temperature; therefore, this parameter modifies the sonochemical activity ( Thompson
and Doraiswamy, 1999 ). The effects of temperature have been studied at both low
(,100 kHz) and high ultrasound frequencies (200 /C01000 kHz). Generally, at low frequen-
cies, the increase in temperature has a detrimental effect on the pollutants degradation
(Table 7.6 )(Psillakis et al., 2004a; Jiang et al., 2006; Goskonda et al., 2002; Zhang et al.,
2011 ). This is attributed to the fact that when the liquid temperature is increased, its vis-
cosity and/or surface tension decreases and the vapor pressure increases; thus, bubbles
contain more water vapor than gas, which cushion bubble implosion. Additionally, the
increasing temperature favors the degassing of the liquid phase, thus diminishing the
number of gas nuclei available for cavitation bubble formation ( Zhang et al., 2011;
Adewuyi, 2001 ). Therefore, for applications in which thermal effects are the main cause of186 7. SONOLYSIS

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTthe degradation (such as frequencies ,100 kHz), a low operating temperature is recom-
mended ( Sutkar and Gogate 2009 ).
In contrast to the observations for low frequencies, at high frequencies when the liquid
temperature increases, the cavitation bubbles formed in the process have a predominant
gaseous nature (i.e., bubbles contain more gas than water vapor) ( Jiang et al., 2006 ). Then,
the number of cavitation bubbles and the rate of radicals production are higher; which
can favor the elimination of pollutants (rhodamine B). However, after a certain tempera-
ture of bulk, there is less dissolved gas in the cavitation bubbles and they have a more
vaporous nature. Under such conditions, similar to the observed at low frequencies, the
increasing temperature declines the pollutants degradation ( Fig. 7.7 ), (Jiang, et al., 2006;
Lifka et al., 2003 ).
7.4.5 Pollutant Concentration
The concentration of pollutants varies depending on the water source. Then, this
parameter is usually evaluated during the removal of organic pollutants upon sonochem-
ical action. The chemical nature of compounds also influences such parameter ( Fig. 7.8 ).
For volatile substances, the degradation rate (r) decreases with the increase of the initial
concentration of organic pollutants ( Jiang et al., 2002a,b; De Visscher et al. 1996; Goel
et al., 2004 ). Meanwhile, the removal of hydrophilic and hydrophobic nonvolatile com-
pounds is increased at higher initial concentrations in the aqueous media ( Merouani et al.,
2010; Okitsu et al., 2005; Serna-Galvis et al., 2015; Torres et al., 2008a,b,c; Villaroel et al.,
2014; Villegas-Guzman et al., 2015 ).
The decreasing in the degradation rate constants at higher initial concentrations of the
volatile compounds is explained by their influence on the cavitation bubble. As concentra-
tion of the volatile substances is increased, more molecules have opportunity of diffusing
into the cavitation bubble. Then, the temperature and pressure within the cavitation bub-
bles decrease and this weakens the cavitational collapse; thus, resulting in a lower effi-
ciency of sonochemical degradation ( Jiang et al., 2002a,b ). On the contrary, when theTABLE 7.6 Effect of T emperature (T) on Sonochemical Degradation of Pollutants

cavitation bubble interface, and the reaction with radicals and thermal processes are more
favored, which resulted in an increase in the degradation rate of these compounds ( Serna-
Galvis et al., 2015 ).
The degradation kinetic of volatile pollutants can be modeled taking into account the
dependence on the initial concentration (C i).De Visscher et al. (1996) proposed that the
rate of degradation (r) can be represented as:
r5kCi
With k 5koe2aCi (7.14)
where k ois the rate constant at infinite dilution (very low concentration of the pollutant)
and reflects the degradability of the volatile compounds on exposure to ultrasound,
whereas the a parameter represents the kinetic factor associated to the inhibitory effect of
the volatile substance due to its own presence in the cavitation bubble ( De Visscher et al.,
1996; Goel et al., 2004 ). This kinetic model assumes that the concentration of the volatile
compound in the bulk liquid phase is proportional to the concentration in the bubble, and
the reaction rate is proportional to the reaction rate in the cavitations during collapse ( De
Visscher et al., 1996 ).
The equation for k can be linearized as follows:
lnk52 aCi1lnk o (7.15)
The k values are the pseudo-first order rate constant at the different initial pollutant
concentrations (C i). Therefore, from the plot of lnk versus C i, the kinetic parameters (k o
and a) are obtained. The comparison between the experimental data (k exp) and the pre-
dicted rate constant using the model (k calc) for different initial concentrations of ethylben-
zene is given in Table 7.7 , where very low error percentages are observed ( ,1%).
Additionally, the linearly shows an excellent correlation coefficient (R250.997). This indi-
cates an excellent fit between the experimental results and the model. However, it should
be mentioned that at high concentrations of volatile compounds (e.g., benzene at 100 mg/
L), some deviations of the model are observed ( De Visscher et al., 1996; Goel et al., 2004 ).
The application of this model to the sonochemical degradation of styrene and the com-
parison of its kinetic parameters ( Table 7.7 ) with those obtained for ethylbenzene shows
that k oand a of styrene are higher. This indicates that styrene is more susceptible than
ethylbenzene to sonodegradation and the increasing of styrene concentration affects more
significantly its own degradation than in the case of ethylbenzene, which is associated to
the more volatile nature of styrene.
On the other hand, for nonvolatile substances, kinetics of degradation (as a function of
initial concentration) can be adjusted to a model based on a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type
mechanism, which considers the movement of pollutant molecules from the bulk solution
to the interfacial region of bubbles. This model proposed by Okitsu et al. (2005) assumes
that: (1) pollutant molecules in the interface are proportional to the initial concentration in
the bulk of solution, (2) the pollutant is in an adsorption/desorption equilibrium between
the interfacial zone and the bulk, and (3) a high concentration of radicals exists at the inter-
facial region and pollutants rapidly react with them ( Okitsu et al., 2005; Chiha et al., 2010 ).
The degradation rate (r) is represented by the following equation:190 7. SONOLYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTr5kKC i=ð11KC iÞ (7.16)
where, C iis the initial concentration of the pollutant, k and K are the rate and the equilib-
rium constant, respectively. The Okitsu et al. Eq. (7.16) can be rewritten in a linear form as
Eq. (7.17) (other forms of linearization are also possible ( Chiha et al., 2010)) , which shows
that the kinetic parameters (k and K) can be obtained from the experimental. A compari-
son of the degradation rate between the experimental values (r exp) and the predicted (r calc)
using the model has been presented ( Table 7.8 ). Low percentages of error are observed
(,5%). In addition, the linearization shows a high correlation coefficient (R250.999). This
indicates the excellent fit between the experimental results and the results obtained by the
model ( Okitsu et al., 2005 ). This kinetic analysis has also been applied to acetaminophen,
dicloxacillin, and parathion ( Villaroel et al., 2014; Villegas-Guzman et al., 2015; Yao et al.,
2010); thus demonstrating its versatility to model for the degradation of different kinds of
nonvolatile organic pollutants.TABLE 7.7 Comparison between the Experimental and the Predicted Values of Sonochemical

et al., 2005; Chiha et al., 2010 ).
7.5 EFFECT OF THE CHEMICAL POLLUTANT NATURE AND ITS
TRANSFORMATIONS UPON SONOCHEMICAL PROCESS
In the sonochemical systems, there are three zones for the pollutants degradation: (1)
the bulk of solution, where attack of radicals take place, (2) the interfacial zone, where rad-
ical attack and/or thermal processes occur, and (3) inside of the bubble through pyrolysis.
The predominant elimination route depends on the nature (structure and physico-
chemical properties) of the pollutants. Furthermore, the analysis of degradation products
provides insights on the main transformations induced by the ultrasound ( Sivasankar and
Moholkar, 2009 ). Therefore here, the effect of the chemical nature and the transformations
of the pollutants upon sonochemical action are presented.
7.5.1 Structural Effects and Physico-Chemical Properties
7.5.1.1 Small Chlorinated Hydrocarbons (SCHs)
Small chlorinated hydrocarbons are organic solvents frequently used as industrial
degreasing agents for the metals, paint stripping, and dry cleaning. They are recognized
as water pollutants, and high frequency ultrasound has been applied to eliminate them.
The treatment of three representative SCHs (dichloromethane, trichloromethane, and tetra-
chloromethane) by sonochemistry have their degradation constants (k) follow the order
(Table 7.9 ):
CCl 4.CHCl 3.CH 2Cl2 (7.17)
These SCHs are volatile substances and as the number of chlorine atoms increases, their
ability to escape from aqueous medium to the gas phase (which is related to the Henry
constant, H) is also higher. Due to its largest H value, CCl 4faster diffuse into the bubbles
and undergo pyrolytic route ( Hung and Hoffmann, 1999 ). Additionally, the bond C-Cl is
weaker than C /C0H; thus, the increasing number of chlorine atoms in the SCHs’ structures
eases the pyrolysis ( Moldoveanu, 2010 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTOther SCHs commonly detected in groundwater, because their poor degradability
under natural conditions, are the 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1-TCE) and trichloroethylene
(TCE). The application of the ultrasound process to eliminate 1-TCE and TCE shows rate
constants of 0.0821 and 0.0668 min21, respectively. In addition, their degradation was not
affected by the presence of tert-butanol, indicating that these SCHs were removed by
direct thermal process inside of cavitation bubbles ( Yim et al., 2001 ). Due to the structural
configuration of 1-TCE, it has lower intermolecular forces than TCE and therefore, 1,1,1-
trichloroethane is more volatile and faster removed sonochemically.
7.5.1.2 Monocyclic Aromatic Compounds (MACs)
Many MACs (e.g., phenol, aniline, toluene, and styrene) are widely used as industrial
precursors (raw materials) of dyes, pesticides, and polymers. As a consequence, this class
of compounds is frequently found in industrial wastewater. The ultrasound process has
shown to be efficient for the treatment of diverse MACs. A relationship between the initial
rates of sonochemical degradation of these substances and their physicochemical para-
meters has been reported ( Nanzai et al., 2008 ). For MACs with skeleton mainly composed
by C and H or C,H, and Cl (such as chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene, and propylbenzene),
their degradation rates (r) correlate well with the Henry constant (H). Thus, the MAC hav-
ing the greatest H value presents the highest degradation rate. Moreover, similar to the
observed for SCH, those volatile MACs containing more chlorine atoms are more suscepti-
ble to sonodegradation. For example, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is eliminated faster than chloro-
benzene ( Jiang et al., 2002a,b ).
Meanwhile, MACs such as phenol, aniline, and benzoic acid, which have polar groups
in their structures, are hydrophobic nonvolatile compounds. Thus, they tend to accumu-
late at the bubble interface and their degradation rates can be related to the Log P (also
named Log K ow), a parameter of hydrophobicity. MACs with higher Log P are more
hydrophobic and present larger r values ( Fig. 7.9 ).
On the other hand, the treatment of a mixture containing both a volatile and a hydro-
phobic nonvolatile MAC shows that in the first stage of the process the degradation of the
volatile compound predominates and the transformation of the nonvolatile only starts,
when the concentration of the volatile compound is very low. This clearly shows that the
presence of a volatile compound hinders the degradation of nonvolatile substances
(Petrier et al., 1998 ).
7.5.1.3 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)
PAHs are derived from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and enter natural waters
through leaching. PAHs are persistent pollutants due to their high chemical stability and
biodegradation resistance ( Rubio-Clemente et al., 2014 ). Representative PAHs (i.e., naphtha-
lene, acenaphthylene, and phenanthrene) have been treated by ultrasound. It is reported
that the degradation follows the order: naphthalene .acenaphthylene .phenanthrene
(Psillakis et al., 2004a ).
These PAHs are semi-volatile pollutants ( Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015 ). The H values
for naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and phenanthrene are 4.4 31024,1 . 131024,a n d
4.2331025, respectively ( National Library of Medicine, 2017 ). As the aromatic rings
number on PAHs increases, the π/C0πinteractions (dispersion forces) are higher making193 7.5 EFFECT OF THE CHEMICAL POLLUTANT NATURE AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsuch substances less volatile. Therefore, phenanthrene and acenaphthylene (which have
three rings) are less susceptible toward d egradation by sonochemical process than
naphthalene (having two rings). In fact, the degradation in the presence of 1-butanol (a
known radical scavenger) shows that acenaph thylene and phenanthrene are more inhib-
ited than naphthalene. This indicates that i n naphthalene, removal via thermal is pre-
dominant; while for the other two PAHs bo th the radical and pyrolytic routes are
involved ( Psillakis et al., 2004a ).
7.5.1.4 Perfluoroalkyl Sulfonates (PFAS) and Perfluoroalkyl Acids (PFAA)
Perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFAS and PFAA) have a wide variety of industrial applica-
tions, e.g., polymers, coatings for paper textiles and metals, film-forming foams, and ther-
mally stable lubricant production. In environmental water, they are extremely persistent,
bioaccumulative in humans, and toxic to animals and wildlife. Perfluorinated compounds
are highly hydrophobic pollutants with very low vapor pressure. Consequently, the sono-
lysis of these substances occurs primarily at the bubble interface through thermal reactions
(Moriwaki et al., 2005; Fernandez et al. 2016 ). Indeed, representative perfluoroalkyl com-
pounds such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanoic sulfonate are not degraded
by the Fenton process (system based on theOH action, which is generated from a reaction
between Fe (II) and H 2O2)(Moriwaki et al., 2005 ), indicating their refractory character
toward even strong oxidizing hydroxyl radical.

478/C0483. With permission.194 7. SONOLYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTAnalysis of structural effects in the sonochemical treatment of PFAS and PFAA shows
that the larger the perfluoroalkyl chain is, the higher the degradation rate is. This is
because an enhancement in the hydrophobic character occurs with the chain length
increasing of the perfluoroalkyl substances. Moreover, the comparison of PFAS and PFAA
with similar chain length indicates that the compounds having carboxylates are degraded
slightly faster than those with sulfonates, and it is attributed to the lower thermal stability
of PFAA ( Fernandez et al., 2016 ).
7.5.1.5 Phthalate Acid Esters (Phthalates)
Phthalates have important uses as plasticizers in the polymeric industries. In recent
years, presence of phthalates in water have gained environmental attention, even at low
concentration levels they can act as disruptors of the endocrine system in humans and
wildlife ( Psillakis et al., 2004a; Xu et al., 2015 ). The phthalates differ in the alkyl chains
and an increasing of such structural groups makes them more hydrophobic ( Psillakis
et al., 2004a ). Consequently, they are more susceptible to sonochemical degradation, which
is clearly illustrated by the ultrasonic treatment of mono-methyl phthalate (MMP),
dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP)
(Table 7.10 )(Xu et al., 2015 ). The sonolytic degradation of a mixture of these phthalates
shows that the rate constants are lower than in the individual treatment, due to the com-
petitive effect among them. However, the degradation of the most hydrophobic phthalate
(DBP) is less affected than the hydrophilic one (MMP).
7.5.1.6 Textile Dyes
There are many classes of textile dyes, and the most used classes are azo, indigo, xan-
thene, phthalocyanine, and tri-phenylmethane. The textile industry is one of the main con-
tributors in terms of the color and organic load in water bodies ( Rayaroth et al., 2015;
Guzman-Duque et al., 2011 ). Textile dyes are hydrophilic substances. They are mainly
degraded by hydroxyl radicals in the bulk of solution (at low pollutant concentrations)
and close to the cavitation bubbles interface (at high concentrations).
Presence of functional groups that increase the hydrophilic character of the dye (e.g.,
sulfonate, amine, or carbonyl) decreases the efficiency of the sonochemical degradation

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT(Ince and Tezcanli-Gu ¨yer, 2004; Rehorek et al., 2004 ). A comparative degradation of acid
orange 7 and reactive orange 16 shows that the former has a larger degradation rate con-
stant. Due to the higher sulfonation of the reactive orange 16 molecule, it is more hydro-
philic and its degradation is slower than the acid orange 7.
7.5.1.7 Organophosphorus Pesticides (OPPs)
Organophosphorus pesticide (OPPs) is a class of substances frequently encountered in
surface water and groundwater coming from agro-industrial processes. OPPs are toxic
and can be bioaccumulated ( Zhang et al., 2010 ). Due to their hydrophobic and nonvolatile
nature, they are mainly degraded in the interfacial region of cavitation bubbles. All the
structural factors that increase the hydrophobic character of OPPs make them more viable
for degradation by ultrasound. The treatment of structurally related OPPs: chlorpyrifos
(Log P: 4.96), and diazinon (Log P: 3.81) shows a higher removal of the former. This is
associated with the longer hydrophobicity of chlorpyrifos caused by the presence of chlo-
rine atoms in its aromatic substituent ( Zhang et al., 2011 ).
7.5.1.8 Pharmaceuticals
Pharmaceuticals are biologically active substances used for the treatment of diseases in
humans and animals. Many of them have been designed to resist the biodegradation.
Currently, pharmaceuticals are associated with the development of adverse effects in
aquatic organisms ( Khetan and Collins, 2007 ). Pharmaceuticals comprise a big set of com-
pounds (analgesics, antimicrobials, hormones, antihypertensives, etc.) with a high struc-
tural diversity.
The sonochemical degradation of pharmaceuticals with different sizes and functional
groups shows a positive relationship between the degradation rates and Log P ( Fig. 7.10 )
Xiao et al. (2014b) . The most hydrophobic compounds are faster degraded. A similar con-
nection between degradation rate and hydrophobicity is also reported for degradation of
other pharmaceuticals ( Isariebel et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2014a ).
7.5.2 Sonochemical Transformations of Pollutants and Their Implications
The degradation of volatile compounds by pyrolysis upon sonochemical action mainly
leads to formation of smaller molecules such as short chain hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide or carbon dioxide. For example, the sonolysis of chlorobenzene initially gener-
ates acetylene and 1,3-butadiyne, which are transformed in further stages to CO, CH 4,and
CO 2(Fig. 7.11 )(Jiang et al., 2002a,b ).
In the case of very hydrophobic and nonvolatile compounds, both thermal and radical
routes can be involved in the degradation. This is illustrated through the sonochemical
destruction of 1,4-dioxane ( Fig. 7.12 )(Beckett and Hua, 2000 ). The thermal route induces
the dioxane ring cleavage to produce small molecules such as ethane, formaldehyde, and
carbon monoxide. The ring opening is also promoted via radical. However, it generates
short chain oxidized species (e.g., methoxyacetic acid, glycolic acid, formaldehyde, and
formic acid), which could be biocompatible.196 7. SONOLYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTMeanwhile, highly hydrophobic and nonvolatile compounds such as PFOS and PFOA,
which are refractory to hydroxyl, are degraded by the shortening of perfluoroalkyl chain
by thermal reactions. This sonochemical action leads to the lowering of the toxicity associ-
ated to PFOS and PFOA, which contributes to the remediation of environmental pollution
(Moriwaki et al., 2005 ).
On the other hand, moderate hydrophobic or hydrophilic compounds are mainly
degraded byOH action. Due to its electrophilic character, the hydroxyl radical has strong

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTreactivity to electron rich moieties such as benzene rings, double bonds, amines, and
thioethers ( Pignatello et al., 2006 ). Therefore, oxidized forms and/or broken species of
these organic moieties are produced. In fact, the successive attack ofOH at aromatic
structures leads to cleavage of rings.
The hydroxyl radical experiments additions to the aromatic rings; and then mono-
hydroxylated compounds, 4-isopropenyl phenol, and hydroquinone are initially generated
during the sonochemical treatment of compounds such as bisphenol-A. The further action
of the process transforms the primary products into aliphatic acids such as formic, acetic,
and oxalic acids. These latter substances are recalcitrant toward ultrasonic process due to
their very high hydrophilic nature; however, many of them are biodegradable.
Similar to moderate hydrophobic compounds, in the case of hydrophilic substances, the
hydroxyl radical attacks their electron-rich regions such as aromatic rings and atoms in
reduced form (e.g., nitrogen of azo moiety), promoting the oxidation of the pollutant and/
or the breakdown to smaller molecules ( Fig. 7.13 ).
In general, the ultrasound process converts toxic substances (e.g., pesticides, endocrine
disruptors, dyes, and pharmaceuticals) into highly oxidized products such as carboxylic
acids of short chain ( Torres et al., 2008a,b,c; Torres et al., 2009; Villaroel et al., 2014 ). In
most cases, such compounds are not toxic and biodegradable, so they can be easily elimi-
nated by a biological treatment or mineralized by combination of sonochemistry with
other systems (e.g., UV irradiation, addition of iron (II)) ( Torres et al., 2008a,b,c; Guzman-
Duque et al., 2011 ). Also, it is recognized that ultrasonic process induces transformations

quently diminishing the risk of bacterial resistance development ( Villegas-Guzman et al.,
2015; Serna-Galvis et al., 2016 ).
It should be mentioned that the transformation of pollutants by pyrolytic and radical
routes involves intermediary mechanistic steps, the understanding of such could be deep-
ened by the reader in the literature ( Moldoveanu, 2010; Pignatello et al., 2006 ).
7.6 INFLUENCE OF WATER MATRIX
IN THE POLLUTANTS DEGRADATION
7.6.1 Effect of pH
The pH value is one of the most important characteristics of water, which must be taken
into account in sonochemical treatment, especially for pollutants with acid-basic functions.
In such case, the pH of water has significant implications on the chemical structure of the
substrate and therefore, on the efficiency of the degradation by the ultrasonic process
(Guzman-Duque et al., 2011 ).
The neutral (noncharged) species of pollutants accumulate more easily at the interface
of cavitation bubbles in comparison with their ionic forms (anion or cation) ( Jiang et al.,
2002a,b ), as a consequence the sonochemical degradation of neutral structures is favored.
Due to the equilibrium between neutral and ionic forms, molecules with carboxylic acids,
amine and phenolic groups have strong modifications in the degradation kinetics with the
FIGURE 7.13 Degradation schema of orange g dye upon ultrasonic action. Adapted from Cai, M., Jin, M.,
Weavers, L.K., 2015. Ultrasonics Sonochem. 18, 1068 /C01076. With permission.199 7.6 INFLUENCE OF WATER MATRIX IN THE POLLUTANTS DEGRADATION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTpH variation of water. pH values below their pKa favor the degradation of compounds
with carboxylic or phenolic groups, while compounds with amine groups are faster
degraded at pH values above of their pKa ( Table 7.11 ). In contrast, for substances without
acid /C0base character (e.g., alachlor pesticide) or with a predominant form at the tested pH
range (e.g., crystal violet dye), the variation of pH has a poor effect on the degradation by
ultrasonic action ( Torres et al. 2009; Guzman-Duque et al. 2011 ).
The pH effect is clearly illustrated by the case of 4-nitrophenol and aniline. The degrada-
tion rate of 4-nitrophenol decreases with the increase in pH, whereas the removal rate of ani-
line exhibits a maximum under alkaline conditions ( Fig. 7.14 )(Jiang et al., 2002a,b ). 4-

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTNitrophenol has a pKa: 7.08 and hence, this compound is deprotonated at pH .pKa (anionic
form, Table 7.12 ), which is more hydrophilic than its neutral form. Thus, the anionic species
of 4-nitrophenol is less susceptible to degradation. Contrary, aniline has a pKa: 4.6, and the
increase in pH above pKa generates its neutral form, which is more hydrophobic than the
cationic one. Additionally, the hydroxyl radical reacts faster with aniline in neutral form (k:
1.431010/M per s) than with anilinium cation (k: 4.8 3109/M per s). This explains the
improvement of aniline degradation with the increasing pH.
On the other hand, in the case of levofloxacin, which has both acid and amine groups,
higher degradation occurs at pH between 6 and 7. At such a pH range, the zwitterionic
form is in equilibrium with the neutral, which favors its elimination ( Guo et al. 2010 ). For
azo dyes containing sulfonate groups, a strong acidification of solution (i.e., pH ,3.0) can
protonate this moiety, making such substances more hydrophobic, and enhancing their
sonodegradation ( Ince and Tezcanli-Gu ¨yer, 2004 ). Therefore, in general, the pH values that
promote a more hydrophobic form of organic pollutants favor their sonochemical
degradations.
7.6.2 Sonochemical Degradation in Presence of Inorganic Components
In the application of advanced oxidation processes, such as ultrasound, the effect of
inorganic components of water matrix, particularly the anion has to be considered,
because of their scavenger ability toward radicals. Other processes such as Fenton, photo-
Fenton, TiO 2-photocatalysis, and UV/H 2O2are negatively affected by inorganic anions
(Torres et al., 2007a,b ). However, the effect of anions on the sonochemical treatment is
different.
Chloride (Cl2), sulfate (SO 422), and bicarbonate (HCO 32) ions are among the anions
most frequently found in wastewater, industrial water, and natural water. Due to their
more hydrophilic nature, chloride, and sulfate anions do not interfere on the degradation
of some target molecules ( Guzman-Duque et al., 2011; Villaroel et al., 2014 ). In other cases,
they can accelerate the sonolysis of organic substances by a “salting-out” effect (the pres-
ence of anions pushes the organics toward the bubble interface leading to an enhancement
of the pollutants degradation). The sonochemical degradation of catechol and resorcinol
was improved by the presence of NaCl and Na 2SO4(Fig. 7.15 )(Uddin et al., 2016 ). The
effect of anions followed the order of the Hofmeister series (i.e., sulfate .chloride), as
SO422has a stronger interaction with water than Cl2. On the other hand, a similar sono-
degradation enhancement by salting-out effect was reported for the treatment of fluoxetine
in the presence of nitrate anion ( Serna-Galvis et al., 2015 ).
Bicarbonate anion has a dual behavior that is determined by the relative concentrations
of both the pollutant and anion. At low concentrations of the target organic compound
and high concentrations of bicarbonate, the removal of the organic pollutant is increased.
Instead, at high concentrations of the pollutant, bicarbonate anion has a competitive effect.
The sonochemical treatment of bisphenol-A under different concentrations of the pollutant
and bicarbonate illustrates the aforementioned situations ( Fig. 7.16 )(Pe´trier et al., 2010 ).
These effects are related with the formation of the carbonate radical and its interaction
with the pollutants.201 7.6 INFLUENCE OF WATER MATRIX IN THE POLLUTANTS DEGRADATION

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe carbonate radical (CO 32) is a strong oxidant (E/C1451.78 V) that results from the
reaction of hydroxyl radical with bicarbonate or carbonate anions ( Eqs. 7.18 /C07.20).
Carbonate radical is able to degrade organic compounds through electron transfer or
hydrogen abstraction.

At relative high concentrations of pollutant, bicarbonate competes with the hydroxyl
radicals and a detrimental effect is observed. When the concentration of the target sub-
stance is much lower than bicarbonate, the produced carbonate radicals can react with the
pollutant improving its degradation. In fact, carbonate radical can migrate to the bulk
solution, to a greater extent than hydroxyl radicals, and enhances the degradation of
hydrophilic pollutants ( Guzman-Duque et al., 2011 ).
The presence of bromide anion (Br2) in the water also increases the sonochemical deg-
radation of pollutants ( Moumeni and Hamdaoui, 2012; Chiha et al., 2011 ). The sonolytic
destruction is augmented with increasing bromide concentration. At high concentrations
of these anions, they reach the interface of bubble and react with hydroxyl radicals, gener-
ating other radical species such as Brand Br 22(Eqs. 7.21 and 7.22 ), which can act as
degrading agents of pollutants. Although, hydroxyl radical is scavenged by bromide, the
presence of radical species in the bulk increases, favoring the removal of pollutants. The
elimination of malachite green (at 5 mg/L) is around 2.7 folds faster in the presence of
5000 mg/L of bromide ion ( Moumeni and Hamdaoui, 2012 ).

cals ( Eqs. 7.23 /C07.25). These radicals are able to enhance the ultrasonic degradation of

Other inorganic substances that improve the pollutants degradation are: Fe (II), TiO 2,
S2O822,H S O 52, and O 3. Their presence leads to a combined action of ultrasound with
other advanced oxidation processes.
Real waters containing organi c pollutants and a high presence of inorganic substances have
been successfully treated by the sonochemical pr ocess. A comparative removal of the fluoxe-
tine pollutant in deionized water and natural mineral water has been developed ( Fig. 7.17 ).
The pollutant degradation in natural mineral water was slightly lower than in deionized
water. The small difference is associated with the high concentration of anions (particularly204 7. SONOLYSIS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTbicarbonate) ( Serna-Galvis et al., 2015 ). Interestingly, the sonochemical treatments of
bisphenol-A or 4-cumylphenol are acce lerated in mineral natural waters ( Torres et al., 2007a,b;
Chiha et al., 2011 ), which is attributed to the role of bi carbonate. Moreover, the addition of
bromide anion to mineral water and seawater sig nificantly enhanced the sonolytic removal of
malachite green, due to the action of bromine radicals ( Moumeni and Hamdaoui, 2012 ).
7.6.3 Sonochemical Degradation of Pollutants in Presence
of Other Organic Components
Organic substances in water can modify the sonodegradation rate of the target contami-
nants. The effect is dependent on the nature of both the pollutant and matrix components
(Table 7.13 )(Serna-Galvis et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2014a ). The degradation of the pharma-
ceuticals acetaminophen and dicloxacillin is not affected by the presence of glucose (a very
hydrophilic organic component) even at concentrations higher than the target compound
(Villegas-Guzman et al., 2015; Villaroel et al., 2014 ). Due to their nature, these pharmaceu-
ticals are closer to cavitation bubble and therefore, hydroxyl radical first reacts with the
pollutants, and degradation is not affected by the glucose presence.
Similarly, mannitol (a typical pharmaceutical excipient) has no effect during the sono-
chemical treatment of oxacillin. This antibiotic is a hydrophobic and nonvolatile

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcompound, whereas the excipient has a hydrophilic character. Thus, oxacillin is selectively
degraded in the interfacial zone. On contrary, when more hydrophobic substances, such
as 1-hexanol, are in water matrix, the elimination of lesser hydrophobic compounds (e.g.,
acetaminophen or fluoxetine) is strong because of the competence byOH.
Presence of CCl 4in water matrix can improve the sonochemical removal of pollutants
(Zheng et al., 2005; Eren and Ince, 2010; Merouani et al., 2010 ); such is the case of rhoda-
mine B (5 mg/L), which is 21-fold faster degraded, when 200 mg/L of carbon tetrachloride
is added ( Merouani et al., 2010 ). The effect is based on the generation of hypochlorous
acid (HOCl), chlorine (Cl 2), and chlorine-type radicals (Cl,CCl 3) coming from sonolysis
of CCl 4(Eqs. 7.26 /C07.28), which react with the target organic contaminants, in addition to
the hydroxyl radical action.

Finally, it is worthy to indicate that the treatment by ultrasound of complex real waters
(e.g., groundwater or wastewater effluent) containing other organic components shows
that the process removes target pollutants. However, the degradation kinetics, in general
terms, are slower than in pure water ( Xiao et al., 2014b; Cheng et al., 2008 ).
7.7 COMBINATION OF SONOCHEMISTRY WITH OTHER PROCESSES
Although sonochemistry successfully degrades a wide number of organic compounds,
in several cases, it has low levels of mineralization ( ,10%), as generated products mainly
have hydrophilic and nonvolatile nature, which limits their complete elimination. Besides,
because of the elevated electrical energy consumption, the operation of ultrasound
demands relative high economical costs. Therefore, short treatment times are a need.
However, in most cases, these difficulties can be overcome by combining ultrasound with
other advanced oxidation processes or biological systems.
Ultrasound can be combined with UV-C light (sono-photolysis), ferrous ions (sono-
Fenton), or ferrous ions and light (sono-photo-Fenton), titanium dioxide and light (sono-
photocatalysis), ozone (sono-ozonolysis), and electrochemistry (sono-electrochemistry).TABLE 7.13 Effect of Organic Matrix Components on Pollutants Degradation

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTSuch combinations involve the additional production of nonselective radicals, which accel-
erate the contaminants degradation and lead to synergistic effects in the mineralization
(Table 7.14 ). The combination of ultrasound with more than one process (e.g., ultrasound/
photo-Fenton/TiO 2-photocatalysis; ultrasound/UV-light/ozone) is also possible. These
cases are discussed in details by the authors ( Torres et al., 2008a,b,c; Me ´ndez-Arriaga
et al., 2009; Tezcanli-Gu ¨yer and Ince, 2004 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTRecently, the joint action of sonochemistry and persulfate or peroxymonosulfate has
also been considered. These systems promote the formation of sulfate radical (SO 42,
E/C1452.6 V) ( Hao et al., 2014; Soumia and Petrier, 2016 ), which is able to degrade refractory
substances through hydroxyl radical (e.g., perfluoroalkyl compounds and cyanuric acid,
(Moriwaki et al., 2005 ;Yin et al., 2016 ;Manoj et al., 2002 ;Liu, 2014 )). Thus, the presence of
sulfate radical, in addition to hydroxyl radical, significantly increases the pollutants degra-
dation. Some examples of the combinations, ultrasound/persulfate and ultrasound/perox-
ymonosulfate, are given ( Table 7.15 ).
In addition to the combinations with advanced oxidation processes, the ultrasound can
be coupled to biological systems (which are low cost treatments). Although sonochemical
process has low mineralizing ability, it is capable to transform many pollutants into biode-
gradable substances. Therefore, after application of ultrasound, microorganisms can elimi-
nate the sono-generated products. For example, the sonication of a solution of oxacillin
during 2 h leads to elimination of the antibiotic and its antimicrobial activity; the subse-
quent application of a biological process (using nonadapted microorganisms from a
municipal wastewater treatment plant) completed the mineralization ( Serna-Galvis et al.,
2016 ). Similarly, the ultrasonic degradation of fluoxetine generates biotreatable products,
which are mineralized by action of aerobic microorganisms ( Serna-Galvis et al. 2015 ).
Additional information about the combination of sonochemistry with other processes
can be found in the following references ( Sathishkumar et al., 2016; Mahamuni and
Adewuyi, 2010; Pang et al., 2011; Papoutsakis et al., 2015 ).
Finally, it can be concluded that sonochemical effects are strongly influenced by opera-
tional parameters (frequency, dissolved gas, and power input, especially), which must be
optimized to obtain the best performance of the process for degradation of pollutants. The
alone action of ultrasound preferentially favors the elimination of compounds with high
hydrophobic or volatile nature. This fact allowed the selective degradation of some pollu-
tants in complex matrices by ultrasound action. Additionally, kinetic models for the sono-
degradation based on the nature of substances can be proposed.
The application of ultrasound for treatment of water polluted with organic substances
lead to environmental benefits (e.g., transformation of hazardous materials into biocom-
patible or innocuous compounds). However, the process has slow degradation rates and
elevated economical costs of operation (caused by high electrical energy consumption).
Such limitations of sonochemical treatment are significantly overcome by combining it
with other processes (AOPs or biological systems).TABLE 7.15 Degradation Enhancement by Combining Ultrasound with Persulfate and Peroxymonosulfate

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe future outlooks in sonochemistry and its combination with other processes should
be focused on applications to real waters containing mixtures of organic and inorganic
substances, determining both kinetics and mechanisms of pollutants degradation, in addi-
tion to toxicity and biodegradability of byproducts. Contaminated waters, where the
pollutant has volatile or hydrophobic nature, are of special interest because of the selectiv-
ity of the technology for this type of organic compound. Also, from an engineering point
of view, the developments in reactors design, scale-up, and ultrasonic transduction effi-
ciency, to maximize the effects in the area of contaminants degradation by ultrasound are
still needed.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
Microwave radiations are the part of electromagnetic radiations with frequency ranging
from 300 MHz to 30 GHz. The major applications of the microwave are in communications
and heating ( Haque, 1999, Banik et al., 2003, Yuan et al., 2006 ). Historically, the develop-
ment of the microwave for the heating of food is more than 50 years old. Later on in the
1970s, the construction of the microwave generator, the magnetron, was improved and
simplified. Consequently, the prices of domestic microwave ovens fell considerably.
However, the design of the oven chamber or cavity, which is crucial for the heating char-
acteristics, was not significantly improved until the 1980s.
Microwave technology has been used in inorganic chemistry since the late 1970s, while
it has only been implemented in organic chemistry since the mid-1980s. The development
of the technology for organic chemistry has been rather slow as compared to combinatorial
chemistry and computational chemistry. This slow acceptance of the technology has been
principally attributed to its lack of controllability and reproducibility, safer aspects, and
generally, a low degree of understanding of the basics of microwave dielectric heating.
Since the mid-1990s, the number of publications in this field has increased significantly.
The reason for this increase may be attributed to the availability of commercial microwave
equipment intended for organic chemistry and the development of the solvent-free tech-
nique, which has improved the safety aspects, but it is mostly due to an increased interest
in shorter reaction times ( Lidstro ¨m et al., 2001 ). Studies have shown that microwave heat-
ing is able to favorably change kinetic and selectivity of reactions ( Raner et al., 1993 ).

Among chemical reactions based on microwaves, it can be cited for the synthesis of dif-
ferent organic and inorganic materials, polymerization, and nanoparticles selective sorp-
tion, reduction /C0oxidation reactions such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).
Microwave chemistry is based on the fact that all materials (compounds, solvents, or reac-
tants) are able to absorb microwave radiation and produce heat ( Lew et al., 2002 ). In the
majority of commercial, scientific, and medical applications microwave ovens with a
frequency of 2.45 GHz are used ( Kesari et al., 2010 ).
Interaction of different compounds with a microwave is based on two special
mechanisms:
dipole interactions and,
ionic conduction.
Both these reactions require effective coupling between target compounds and an elec-
tric field related to oscillating microwave. Dipole interactions happened for polar mole-
cules. When passing a microwave through polar molecules, both polar ends of these
molecules start to reorient and will constantly align themselves with a magnetic field, to
which they are influenced ( Lidstro ¨m et al., 2001 )(Fig. 8.1 ).
This molecular rotation led to increasing intermolecular interactions, resulting in
increasing temperature. Whenever a molecule is more polar, coupling with microwave
radiation will be relatively better. Ion conduction fundamental is similar to polar interac-
tions and has little difference with it. Ions are charged particles dispersed in solutions and
could couple with an electric field related to microwave, and increase their movement
dimension to increase the temperature. Therefore, it is expected that ion concentration has
a remarkable effect on microwave heating efficiency.
Polar molecules are molecules containing atoms, whose electronegativity (tendency to
attract electrons) is different from each other. This difference is the cause for electric cloud
asymmetric distribution around molecules, and therefore accumulation of negative or pos-
itive charges may be more on one side than the other. This phenomenon is an important
factor for the formation of polar molecules ( Lidstro ¨m et al., 2001 ).
FIGURE 8.1 Effect of alternating electric field from microwave on polar molecules and ions.216 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe ability of a solvent for extraction of negative or positive ions from each other, under
microwave radiation, is named dielectric constant ( εv)(Zlotorzynski, 1995 ). Materials with
higher dielectric constant have higher microwave absorption and heat production than
others ( Lidstro ¨m et al., 2001 ).
8.1.2 Losses Factor or Tan δ

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT8.1.3 Characteristic of Heating Microwave
Common heating sources in chemical reactions include oil bath, electric heating, gas
flame, or water heating by convection, conduction, or radiation ( Fig. 8.2 ). Only dielectric
compounds are able to absorb microwave radiation and produce heat. In spite of fast
material heating, by microwave radiation, the materials are quickly cooled on removing
microwave radiations.
One of the problems about common heating is that a heating process happens from out-
side to inside, and therefore, the hottest part of the system is formed in reactor walls. But
under microwave heating, first reactant and then reactor walls are heated, and reactants
are quickly cooled by conductive method after stopping radiation. Other characteristics of
the microwave and conventional heating have been shown in Table 8.2 .

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT8.2 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Wastewater treatment is an undeniable part of human society. The wastewaters are
produced by numerous sectors including industries, agriculture, municipalities, etc. The
accumulation of wastewater results in several environmental problems, health issues,
safety hazards, and prevents sustainable development in terms of the reuse of wastewater.
Many of these wastewaters include some refractory compounds such as lignocelluloses,
which are highly stable against enzymatic or bacterial attacks ( Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008 ).
Nowadays, there is a continuously increasing worldwide concern for the development
of alternative water reuse technologies, which are mainly focused on agricultural and
industrial wastewaters. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)-assisted with a microwave
are considered a highly competitive wastewater treatment technology for the removal of
organic pollutants that are not treatable by other conventional techniques due to their high
chemical stability and/or low biodegradability. Although chemical oxidation for complete
mineralization is usually expensive, its combination with a microwave or microwave/oxi-
dants is widely reported to reduce operating costs.
Using microwave-assisted with other processes (MAP) is a simple technology that has
been given special consideration because of high efficiency. It is known that photon energy
is lonely 0.0016 eV. The amount of this energy is not sufficient for breaking of chemical
bonds. This energy is even lower than Browning energy, and therefore, a microwave alone
will not lead to chemical oxidations ( Kappe, 2004; Stuerga et al., 1993; A ´Mingos, 1992 ).
Chemical oxidations by microwave are based on non-thermal effects between a micro-
wave and dielectric (microwave absorbing sheets) ( Jacob et al., 1995 ). The effect of micro-
wave irradiation in organic synthesis is based on thermal and nonthermal effects (super
heating or hot spots, and selective absorption of radiation by polar substances) ( de la Hoz
et al., 2005 ).
During the last few years, a microwave has been used alone as well as assisted with
other catalysts. A microwave usually increases the rate of reaction of other AOPs and
for this reason, a microwave is applied along with oxidations such as MW/UV/TiO 2,
MW/UV, and MW/UV/H 2O2(Remya and Lin, 2011a; Horikoshi et al., 2011; Asgari et al.,
2013).
The removal of 4-chlorophenol under H 2O2and microwave alone was negligible, but
the removal efficiency was increased significantly under microwave/H 2O2(Movahedyan
et al., 2009 ).
The reason of this phenomenon is due to the existence of superheating and the produc-
tion of hydroxyl radical in microwave/H 2O2. Different radicals are produced under a
microwave based on a catalyst and organic matter types ( Zhao et al., 2011; Movahedyan
et al., 2009 ).
H2O2has been typically used in advanced oxidation processes and in situ chemical oxi-
dation (ISCO) because it is a strong agent for oxidation and radical production. H 2O2is
also economic and its decomposition led to safe materials like H 2O and O 2.H2O2is able to
participate in processes such as O 3/H2O2, UV/H 2O2,o rF e21/H2O2. The required H 2O2
concentration in reactions can be very different and it may change from micro mole to
mole. The amount of its concentration is quite dependent on the type of advanced219 8.2 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENToxidation process, type of treatment, required efficiency, and chataracteristics of the pollu-
tants. Hydroxyl radical with standard oxidation potential (E o) of 2.7 V is produced by
H2O2dissociation ( Asgari et al., 2013; Asgari et al., 2014; Chavoshani et al., 2016 ).
Hydrogen peroxide is a multiuse oxidant applied in many treatment systems. It is one
of the inexpensive oxidizers usually used in AOPs as well as in situ chemical oxidation
(ISCO) because it is a strong oxidizing agent and a potent source ofOH radicals at eco-
nomical level of oxidation ( Wu and Englehardt, 2012 ). H 2O2can also be used to remove
cyanides, chromium (VI), oxidation of sulfur compounds, and for elimination of some
inorganic nitrogen compounds. Hydrogen peroxide can be applied directly or with a
catalyst. The use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant has a number of advantages and
these are:
It is cheaper, readily available, easy to store, relatively safe to handle and
environmentally friendly since it slowly decomposes into oxygen and water.
It is a very cost effective source of hydroxyl radicals as two hydroxyl radicals are
formed for each molecule of H 2O2photolyzed.
Peroxyl radicals are generated afterOH attack on most organic substrates; thus,
facilitating oxidation reactions ( Legrini et al., 1993; Sahoo et al., 2011 ).
A microwave led to decomposition of H 2O2in a microwave/H 2O2process producing
hydroxyl radical (OH). The following reactions are attributed to H 2O2decomposition
under a microwave ( Zhao et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2009 ).

According to previous studies, efficiency of microwave/H 2O2is affected by many fac-
tors such as intensity, pH, pollutants concentration, H 2O2concentration, radical scaven-
gers, and others.
8.2.1 Energy Intensity
Materials are able to absorb microwave energy by two mechanisms, i.e. polarization
and ion current. The amount of energy absorbed and selected optimal energy depend on
reactants and solvents under a microwave system ( Clark and Sutton, 1996 ). Therefore,
basically, selected optimal energy is different for each system. It is notable that increasing
intensity will not be equal to increasing efficiency of a process, but in most of the studies
with increasing energy intensity, removal efficiency has been increased ( Zhang et al., 2007,
Eskicioglu et al., 2008; Robinson et al., 2010 ). Efficiency removal of pentachlorophenol was
increased from 31.82 to 90.82% under 180 and 600 Watt energy (intensity), respectively
(Asgari et al., 2013 ).Movahedyan et al. (2009) also showed that the degradation rate of220 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTp-chlorophenol was increased along with the increase in the microwave power. It was
observed that percent degradation of p-chlorophenol at 180 min irradiation time was 93%
in 600 W and 85.4% in the same time when the microwave was adjusted to the power of
180 W. Yang et al. (2009) made similar observations during removal of pharmaceutical for-
mulations by microwave/Fenton process.
Depending on the type of reactants, use of higher intensity of microwave energy may
result in superheating and sometimes, it is referred to as boiling retardation, or boiling
delay. Larhed and Hallberg (2001) conducted reactions in acetonitrile (boiling
point581/C14C/C082/C14C) using different microwave power or intensity. It has been observed
that at the reaction temperature (145/C14C) under microwave power 500 W, the boiling point
of acetonitrile has been increased more than its standard value ( Fig. 8.3 ).
Temperature profiles were recorded using fluoroptic probes. The reaction between
H2O2and organic matter is an exothermic process and heat produced in the reactor
quickly increases the temperature of the system ( Veschetti et al., 2000 ). It should be noticed
in dissociation of H 2O2by microwave that H 2O2is unstable and will break down into H 2O
and O 2. Heating a H 2O2solution would cause this breakdown to occur more quickly, per-
haps with much foaming. This phenomenon is a disturbing factor under higher micro-
wave powers and it should be considered ( Chavoshani, 2012 ).
8.2.2 pH
pH is one of the most important factors in organic compounds degradation
(Movahedyan et al., 2009 ). Several studies on MW/H 2O2system showed that high

permission.221 8.2 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsubstrate oxidation efficiencies usually appeared at acidic and neutral pH ( Eskicioglu
et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009 ). They observed that the highest substrate removal rate was
pH 6, while the lowest one was at pH 11 and it was inferred to be due to self-
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide since this is very limited and its scavenging effect of
hydroxyl radicals in alkaline media ( Sanz et al., 2003 ). Microwave-assisted degradation of
carbofuran in the presence of granular active carbon (GAC), zero valent iron (ZVI), and
H2O2was studied by Remya and Lin (2011b); the influence of reaction temperature and
pH was observed in the microwave-assisted GAC system. The degradation efficiency was
increased with the increasing pH, whereas for the increase in pH from 2 to 4 resulted in
decrease in the carbofuran degradation efficiency in the microwave-assisted-ZVI and H 2O2
systems. The reason for this decrease in the degradation efficiency was not very clear.
Contrary to these results the degradation of rhodamine B and methylene blue in MW/
H2O2system was found to be very competitive at extreme alkaline pH ( Hong et al., 2012 ).
This is interesting to note. The tests of radical species and control experiments were
conducted. Degradation of rhodamine B at strong alkaline pH in MW/H 2O2system was
considered to mainly undergo oxygen oxidation, and the enhancement of MW thermal
effect. It provided a possible, effective way to degrade pollutants at highly alkaline circum-
stances, and it might promote the development of MW/H 2O2technology in alkaline
wastewater treatment. Asgari et al. (2013) observed that pentachlorophenol removal effi-
ciency under microwave/H 2O2at pH 3, 7 and 11 was 53.82, 56.82, and 63.82%, respec-
tively. ( Movahedyan et al., 2009 ) also opined that the degradation reactions were
enhanced in an alkaline medium.
Organic compounds like phenolic compounds, are in anionic state at alkaline pH and
absorb microwave more than at other pHs. Activated oxygen produced from hydrogen
peroxide plays a key role under alkaline pH removal of organic compounds, except radical
scavengers that may lead to the limitation of this condition ( Hong et al., 2012;
Movahedyan et al., 2009; Asgari et al., 2013 ). Multivariate analysis of sludge disintegration
by the microwave/H 2O2pretreatment process, make it clear that a high pH appears to be
effective in reducing percentage of sludge removal ( Wang et al., 2009 );whereas low pH
was found to be favorable for the release of heavy metals and resulted in a decrease in vol-
atile suspended solid/total suspended solid (VSS/TSS) for the treated sludge particles
(Ya-Wei et al., 2015 ).
8.2.3 Pollutants Concentration
It is clear that oxidation processes assisted with microwave have high efficiency in
removal of larger concentration of organic compounds. Phenols, aromatic hydrocarbons,
and PCBs with concentrations 1000, 5000, and 10,000 mg/L, can be removed from raw oil
in 98%, 96%, and 92%, respectively ( Roshani and vel Leitner, 2011 ).Asgari et al. (2013)
also observed that microwave/H 2O2process is able to remove 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750,
and 1000 mg/L concentrations of pentachlorophenol (PCP) with efficiency 93%, 82%, 92%,
91%, 90%, 89%, 88%, and 87%, respectively. Increasing PCP concentration had a negligible
role in decreasing process efficiency (approximately 7%). Consequently, selection of222 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT1000 mg/L as the optimal dose was not economic and PCP concentration of 100 mg/L
used for further experiments. These amounts are much higher than commonly adopted in
attractive AOPs ( Shiying et al., 2009 ) due to the high efficiency of processes integrated
with microwave and non-thermal effects in these processes. HPLC data indicated that
major organic pollutants are mineralized and there is a lack of toxic intermediates and
byproducts ( Han et al., 2004; Asgari et al., 2013 ).
8.2.4 H 2O2Concentration
The efficiency of this microwave/H 2O2system is influenced by an ionic and polariza-
tion amount of the system. It is expected that with increasing H 2O2, a polar molecule with
the potential of oxidation reduction 1.87, the efficiency of microwave/H 2O2will be
increased. H 2O2is a polar molecule and it has not only the ability to absorb microwave
radiation, but also the ability to produce hydroxyl radical (OH with 2.8 eV) and other
radicals. This characteristic led to more efficiency of H 2O2(Zhao et al., 2011 ). Results of
Asgari et al. (2013) have shown that PCP removal efficiency under microwave/H 2O2for
0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mol/L of hydrogen peroxide was 23.82%, 63.82%, 81.82%,
90.82%, and 90.82% at 60 min, respectively. PCP removal was almost stable at doses of
0.2 and 0.3 mol/L. Therefore, an H 2O2dose of 0.2 mol/L was selected and used as the
optimal dose.
Recently, the microwave/H 2O2system was used as a tool for pretreatment of activated
sludge. It has been emphasized that optimal H 2O2dosing is a function of multivariables.
Wang et al. (2009) found that this optimal dosing is a function of temperature, pH, COD,
and TSS of pollutants. It is favorable to model the relationship of H 2O2concentration with
temperature, COD, pH, TSS, and the removal amount of pollutants ( Ya-Wei et al., 2015 ).
High H 2O2concentration led to interference in chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal,
and therefore, it is suitable to select optimal H 2O2dosage based on ratios of H 2O2/total
chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) in the AOP of microwave and H 2O2(Chavoshani et al.,
2016; Wang et al., 2009 ).
It has been reported that H 2O2residual in AOPs led to interference in the (COD) test;
and it is able to hinder biological treatment of wastewater. In laboratory scale, a large
amount of H 2O2residual can be estimated to be about 70% /C080% of its initial concentra-
tion, and allocates high mole concentration to itself, leading to overestimation of the COD
measurements. The amount of hydrogen peroxide interference depends on the type of pol-
lutants. An average of COD after the reaction, COD before the reaction, removed COD,
and false COD was 56206, 40650, 26707.57, and 13943 mg/L respectively ( Chavoshani
et al., 2016 ). This removal of COD has been very low. Reports on mixed waste chemicals
existing in solid waste leachate, indicate that apart from residual H 2O2, other factors such
as chloride, bromide, iodide, ferrous and ferric ions, sulfide, and manganese led to inter-
ference and errors in the COD test. In fact, these factors resulted in false COD ( Rezaeei
et al., 2008 ). More efforts are required for optimization of H 2O2dosing in order to make it
cost effective technology through reducing both H 2O2costs and residual H 2O2in sludge
(Wang et al., 2009 ).223 8.2 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT8.2.5 Radical Scavengers
Formation of hydroxyl radical (OH) under microwave/H 2O2is an important factor for
removal of organic materials for deciding the role of OHradicals. Tert-butyl ether (TBA)
was used as a radical scavenger in oxidations processes. Asgari et al. (2013) showed that
tert-butyl ether led to the removal of PCP from 93.82% to 90.82%, which means that PCP
removal was decreased as much as 3%.
A number of attempts were made to confirm the hydroxyl radical production during
the microwave process. Contrary to this belief, rhodamine B removal under microwave/
H2O2has shown that the participation ofOH is negligible in this process, because when
methanol was added as a radical scavenger, removal efficiency showed no significant
change. It seems that, in addition toOH radicals, other intermediate radicals play the
main role in microwave/H 2O2process; O 2was generated as the main species from the
decomposition of H 2O2in alkaline MW/H 2O2system, which then oxidizes the substrate
(Fig. 8.4 ). Meanwhile, MW thermal effect could enhance the decomposition of H 2O2, gen-
erating more O 2to accelerate the degradation of the substrate ( Hong et al., 2012 ).
8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY
Huge amounts of sewage sludge are produced yearly with improving wastewater treat-
ment facilities. Over 6.25 million tons of dry sludge was produced in 2013 in China and it
is increasing with the annual growth rate of 13% ( Yang et al., 2015 ). Management of
sludge is a very sensitive and expensive responsibility. Today, sludge disposal has become
a problem of sludge management because up to 50% of the current operating costs of a
wastewater treatment plant are allocated to sludge treatment. Although different disposal
routes (incineration, landfill, and agricultural applications) are possible for sludge manage-
ment, due to environmental health hazards and economic costs, the selection of other

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTmethods needs further studies ( Appels et al., 2008 ). Reduce, reuse, and recycle (commonly
known as 3Rs) are the three basic options available for sludge treatment. Among the 3Rs’
treatment options, reducing the amount of sludge produced is regarded as the ideal
method for solving the problems associated with sludge treatment.
Sewage sludge can be considered as a renewable energy resource, The sewage sludge
has calorific values ranging from 11 to 17 MJ/kg, in Poland that is equal to burning about
443,000 tons of raw coal ( Cao and Pawłowski, 2013 ). About 60% of all sewage sludge was
applied to land as a soil amendment and fertilizer for growing crops in the United States
(Lu et al., 2012 ). This type of compost played a key role for sustainable nutrient manage-
ment for a variety of vegetables and plants ( Clarke and Smith, 2011 ). Anaerobic digestion
(AD) of sludge as an efficient and sustainable technology for sludge treatment has been
proposed. The benefits of AD are including mass reduction, odor removal, pathogen
reduction, less energy use, and more significantly, energy recovery in the form of methane
(Pilli et al., 2011 ). Degradable organic compounds were converted to methane (CH 4) and
carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the absence of elemental oxygen and the presence of anaerobic
bacteria process in AD of sludge.
The stabilization and disintegration of anaerobic sludge occur in four stages: hydrolysis,
acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis by three different groups of bacteria. The
first group involves hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria, which hydrolyze the complex sub-
strates (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, etc.) to dissolved monomers (sugars, fatty acids,
amino acids, etc.) and further to CO 2,H 2, organic acids, and alcohols ( Pilli et al., 2011 ).
Due to competition between sulfate-reduction bacteria and methane-forming bacteria,
depends on various factors like pH, temperature, HRT, C/N ratio, VS/COD reduction,
lack of process stability, low loading rates, slow recovery after failure, and specific require-
ments for waste composition, digestion of anaerobic sludge and biogas production is a rel-
atively slow process ( Ali Shah et al., 2014 ).
Much efforts have been devoted to develop sludge disintegration and solubilization tech-
niques that feed back to the biological processing step for further biodegradation ( Øegaard,
2004). This type of process is known as lysis /C0cryptic growth ( Zhou et al., 2013 ). In most
treatment technologies, breaking the cell walls of the sludge particles is a key problem, due
to the protection offered by the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Therefore, pretreat-
ment technologies can be used to disrupt the cell walls, which will also help to improve bio-
gas production, recover materials such as proteins, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), nitrogen, and
phosphorus, and improve sludge dewatering. There are many sludge pretreatment technol-
ogies available and these are physical, chemical, mechanical, or biological hydrolysis, or a
combination of these methods ( Wang et al., 2015 ). The microwave (MW) technology has
gained widespread popularity as an effective thermal method for sludge treatment ( Tyagi
and Lo, 2013 ). Another promising application of MW technology is in pyrolysis, which
involves heating dried sludge at temperatures above 300/C14C in the absence of water and oxy-
gen, to produce valuable gases and oils ( Manara and Zabaniotou, 2012 ).
The major driving force behind the rise in the use of MW technologies is the fact that
heating with MW energy is superior to conventional heating, mainly in terms of its ability
to heat rapidly and selectively; thereby accelerating reaction rates. MW heating minimizes
hazardous product formation and emissions, which renders this technique environmen-
tally friendly.225 8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTA combination of MW and chemical pretreatment techniques has been suggested as a
sludge pretreatment method due to increasing solubilization of the volatile suspended
solids (VSS) ( Tyagi and Lo, 2013 ). Nowadays, application of microwave technology and its
combined processes for sludge pretreatment has received increased attention. Some of
these technologies include microwave with pressure seal, microwave under ambient pres-
sure conditions, microwave-acid, microwave-alkali, and microwave-H 2O2(MW/H 2O2)
process. These technologies have been used to improve sludge disintegration and sludge
disinfection. Among them, MW/H 2O2has been indicated to be the most efficient.
Oxidation power of H 2O2can be enhanced using a microwave. When H 2O2and micro-
wave are combined, H 2O2absorbs MW radiation and breaks down intoOH radicals,
which reduce the pollutants in the sample.
8.3.1 Volatile Fatty Acids Production By MW/H 2O2
Volatile fatty acids (VFA) are short-chain fatty acids consisting of six or fewer carbon
atoms that can be distilled at atmospheric pressure. They are including acetic acid, propio-
nic acid, and butyric acid. These acids have a wide range of applications such as in the
production of bioplastics, bioenergy, and the biological removal of nutrients from waste-
water. At present, commercial production of VFA is mostly accomplished by chemical
routes. However, the use of nonrenewable petrochemicals as raw materials and the
increasing price of oil have renewed the interest in biological routes of VFA production. In
biological VFA production, pure sugars such as glucose and sucrose have been commonly
employed as the main carbon source, which raises the ethical concern on the use of food
to produce chemicals. This issue can be resolved by utilizing organic-rich wastes such as
sludge generated from wastewater treatment plants, food waste, organic fraction of munic-
ipal solid waste, and industrial wastewater for VFA production. Such transformation of
waste into VFA also provides an alternative route to reduce the ever increasing amount of
waste generated ( Lee et al., 2014 ).
In general, the production of VFA from waste is an anaerobic process involving hydro-
lysis and acidogenesis (the latter is also known as acidogenic fermentation) Bengtsson
et al. (2008) or dark fermentation ( Su et al., 2009 ). In hydrolysis, complex organic polymers
in waste are broken down into simpler organic monomers by the enzymes excreted from
the hydrolytic microorganisms ( Lee et al., 2014 ).
Subsequently, acidogens ferment these monomers mainly into VFA such as acetic, pro-
pionic, and butyric acids. Both processes involve a complex consortium of obligate and
facultative anaerobes, such as bacteriocides, clostridia, bifidobacteria, streptococci, and
enterobacteriaceae. However, it is common practice that the hydrolysis and acidogenesis
are conducted simultaneously in a single anaerobic reactor.
In the past decades, numerous efforts had been devoted to maximize the production of
VFA by exploring different types of wastes and regulating the operating conditions of the
anaerobic reactor. It is now realized that proper process control can manipulate the type of
VFA produced, which is critical to the performances of the downstream applications such
as the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (biodegradable plastics), electricity, biogas,
and the biological removal of phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewater( Lee et al., 2014 ).226 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTMW/H 2O2pretreatment is a suitable way for maximization of VFA from anaerobic
sludge. The VFAs are a product of hydrolysis and acidification, and a precursor for meth-
ane production ( Devi et al., 2014 ).
Liao et al. found that the combined microwave-hydrogen peroxide-sulfuric acid
enhanced advanced oxidation process (MW/H 2O2/H1-AOP), and is able to increase VFA
concentration. The highest VFA concentration was obtained for soluble substrates with
acid treatment only. The VFA concentrations of the resulting solution could be controlled
by amounts of acid used in the MW/H 2O2-AOP process( Liao et al., 2006 ).
In the study of Eskicioglu et al. (2008), VFA removal under different reactions has been
reported: acetic acid removal by H 2O2(0.9 g/L), MW-60/C14C (0.8 g/L), MW-60/C14C/
H2O2(1.9 g/L), MW-80/C14C(1 g/L), MW-80/C14C/H 2O2(1.3 g/L), MW-100/C14C(0.7 g/L), MW-
100/C14C/H 2O2(1 g/L), MW-120/C14C(0.7 g/L), and MW-120/C14C/H 2O2(1.1 g/L); propionic acid
removal by H 2O2(0.6 g/L), MW-60/C14C (0.6 g/L), MW-60/C14C/H 2O2(1.1 g/L), MW-80/C14C
(0.7 g/L), MW-80/C14C/H 2O2(0.9 g/L), MW-100/C14C(0.6 g/L), MW-100/C14C/H 2O2(0.8 g/L),
MW-120/C14C(0.7 g/L), and MW-120/C14C/H 2O2(0.8 g/L); and butyric acid removal by H 2O2
(0.0 g/L), MW-60/C14C (0.4 g/L), MW-60/C14C/H 2O2(0.0 g/L), MW-80/C14C(0.0 g/L), MW-80/C14C/
H2O2(0.2 g/L), MW-100/C14C(0.0 g/L), MW-100/C14C/H 2O2(0.4 g/L), MW-120/C14C(0.0 g/L). and
MW-120/C14C/H 2O2(0.2 g/L). These results show that the heights VFA removal was attrib-
uted to acetic acid under MW-60/C14C/H 2O2.
8.3.2 Change of Biological Nutrient in Anaerobic Sludge
Biological nutrient removal (BNR) from wastewater has been widely used in the world.
Several methods have been reported to remove nutrients (ortho-phosphorus, ammonium,
protein, carbohydrate and oil) from anaerobic sludge ( Tong and Chen, 2009 ).
It has been reported in several studies that MW/H 2O2process is able to remove nutri-
ents from anaerobic sludge. Hydrogen peroxide, as a strong oxidizer, converts some of the
sensitive organic compounds to CO 2and water in addition to many others oxidized to
other organics containing stable functional groups; therefore it will provide some level of
permanent stabilization. Table 8.3 indicates the effects of MW and MW/H 2O2treatments
on total organic matter composition in terms of TS, total COD, total proteins, total sugars,
total humic acids, as well as supernatant NH 3-N concentrations.
Based on this table, hydrogen peroxide oxidized a portion of sludge in H 2O2and
MW/H 2O2treated samples and caused reductions in the total organic solids and biopo-
lymers. The TWAS sample, treated with H 2O2(1 g H 2O2/g TS), lost 19 60%, 18 65%,
1163%, 34 63%, and 16 62% of TS, COD, proteins, sugars, and humic acid concentra-
tions, respectively, through oxidation compa red to controls. The concentration of organic
compounds present in the TWAS samples decreased further when H 2O2was combined
with MW irradiation especially at temperatures above 80/C14C. At MW temperature of
120/C14C, MW/H 2O2samples experienced additional 2%, 12%, 27%, 52%, and 45% reduc-
t i o n si nt h e i rT S ,C O D ,p r o t e i n s ,s u g a r s ,a n d humic acid concentrations, respectively,
compared to the H 2O2treated sample. The level of permanent stabilizations in similar
samples (MW/H 2O2at 120/C14C) were 20 60%, 28 62%, 35 60%, 68 60%, and 53 61% for
TS, COD, proteins, sugars and humic acids compared to the original raw TWAS (control)227 8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsample. It is possible that the elevated MW temperatures increased the decomposition of
H2O2intoOH radicals and enhanced the oxidation process when both MW and H 2O2
are applied. Among organic substances studied, the sugars and humic acids experienced
the highest level of reductions after H 2O2(16% /C034%) and MW/H 2O2(53%/C068%) treat-
ments at 120/C14C(Eskicioglu et al., 2008 ).
All pretreatment scenarios contained higher NH 3-N in their supernatants compared to
that of control. Both H 2O2treatment and MW irradiation resulted in significant (2 /C04 fold)
ammonia release into solution over the control ( Table 8.3 ). These results are in agreement
with previous studies that concluded both MW and MW/H 2O2treatments enhance the
release of ammonia depending on the MW temperature and H 2O2concentration ( Wong
et al., 2006; Yin et al., 2007 ). Among the pretreatment temperatures tested, the TWAS

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsample pretreated at 60/C14C contained the highest ammonia concentration which was
451 mg/L. The other TWAS samples pretreated at 80/C14C, 100/C14C, and 120/C14C had NH 3-N con-
centrations of 341, 304, and 185 mg/L, respectively.
These results are in agreement with previous studies that concluded both MW and
MW/H 2O2treatments enhance the release of ammonia depending on the MW temperature
and H 2O2concentration.
It was expected that by using a combination of MW and H 2O2, polymeric network disinte-
gration could be increased. As it can be observed from Figs. 8.5A /C0D,a l lM W ,H 2O2,and
MW/H 2O2treatments increased the amount of soluble COD, soluble proteins, soluble sugars,
and soluble humic acid fractions in the TWAS samples compared to those of control. The level
of COD solubilizations without the presence of H 2O2were 360%, 1260%, 1560%, 1660%,
and 1561% for control, MW-60, MW-80, MW-100, and MW-120 samples, respectively.
Furthermore, H 2O2, MW-60/H 2O2, MW-80/H 2O2, MW-100/H 2O2,and MW-120/ H 2O2
samples achieved 17 62%, 15 61%, 18 60%, 21 61%, and 24 61% COD solubilizations,
respectively, indicating that a synergistic disintegration effect was observed when both
treatments were combined, and resulted in smaller organic compounds ( Fig. 8.5A ). Both
proteins and humic acids can be found in polymeric network as extra- and intra-cellular
compounds. The increase of concentration of these compounds in the soluble phase of
WAS after both MW and MW/H 2O2treatments is evidence of disintegration and solubili-
zation floc structure as MW temperature increased. In general, the COD solubilization
trend observed in this table was consistent with the data obtained in other MW/H 2O2
studies on sludge. The results in Fig. 8.5A /C0Drevealed that H 2O2and MW/H 2O2treat-
ments did not only reduce the amount of total organic residues in TWAS, but also reduced
the particulate fractions by converting them into soluble ( ,0.45 mm) organics. Among the
organic substances studied, higher levels of solubilizations were achieved in humic acids
and sugars, which were 37 61% and 35 62% for the MW/H 2O2sample at 120/C14C
(Fig. 8.5C, D )(Eskicioglu et al., 2008 ).
Also, the influence of combined pretreatment on the concentration of suspended solids,
SCOD, protein, carbohydrate, Suspended solid (SS) percentage, and COD solubilization
has been perforemd. It was observed that at optimal specific energy input (18,600 kJ/kg
TS), the SCOD concentration, protein, and carbohydrate in the medium were found to
increase with all types of MW pretreatment. The SCOD, protein, and carbohydrate release
at this energy level were found to be 7.4, 12.3, and 13.8 g/L; 0.7, 1.5, and 1.7 g/L, and 0.05,
0.15, and 0.16 g/L, respectively.
The increase in the soluble organics was mainly due to synergistic effects brought about
by the combined action of MW, H 2O2, and acidic condition. Among different treatments,
combined pretreatment was proved to be effective compared to MW alone ( Eskicioglu
et al., 2008 ). COD solubilizations for MW, MW/H 2O2, and MW/H 2O2/acid at the MW
energy of 18,600 kJ/kg TS, were recorded to be 30.2%, 50.3%, and 56.1%, respectively. The
highest solubilization (56.1%) was noted with MW/H 2O2/acid combination. This could be
due to the fact that the hydroxyl radical formation was higher at a lower pH, which
increased the efficiency of H 2O2. The currently achieved COD solubilization (56%) at an
energy input of 18,600 kJ/kg TS was relatively greater than that achieved in other studies,
in which greater energy input was used to obtain similar solubilization.229 8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY

With permission.Similarly, the SS concentration in the medium was found to decrease in all types of
MW disintegration of sludge. The SS concentrations for MW, MW 1H2O2, and MW/
H2O2/acid were recorded to be 15, 13.3, and 12.7 g/L, respectively at the MW specific
energy of 18,600 kJ/kg TS. The corresponding SS reductions at this energy level were cal-
culated to be 20.9%, 29.5%, and 33.1%, respectively. The addition of H 2O2dosage resulted
in a significant increase in MW assisted SS reduction from 20.9% to 29.5%. This could be
because of rapid formation of the MW-mediated hydroxyl radicals from H 2O2. The acidifi-
cation of sludge (pH 5) further increased the SS reduction from 29.5% to 33.1%.
8.3.3 Biochemical Methane Potential Assays
The biochemical methane potential (BMP) test is increasingly being recognized as a
viable method to explore and determine the feasibility of a material to serve as a substrate
in AD. BMP assays provide an array of information on the substrate including how fast
and how much of the material can be degraded under optimal conditions as well as the
potential methane yield from the material. A primary output of BMP assays is cumulative
methane production curves, where the cumulative specific methane production is plotted
against time. The patterns these curves follow are far from trivial and have meaningful
implications on the degradation of the substrate. The kinetics of the different stages of the
AD process (hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis) and ultimately
the shape of the methane production curves is primarily controlled by the biodegradability
characteristics of the substrate, the production of inhibitory intermediate fermenters, and
the performance of the methanogenic bacterial population ( Ware and Power, 2017 ).
An anaerobic biodegradability assay has been performed with MW, MW/H 2O2, and
MW/H 2O2/acid-pretreated and the control sludge during 30 days. Among them, the
MW/H 2O2/acid pretreated sample has produced the highest methane yield of 323 mL/g
VS at the end of 30 days. The MW/H 2O2-pretreated sample had a maximum methane pro-
duction of 288 mL/g VS, while for MW-pretreated sample, the methane production was
175 mL/g VS. The methane production of the control sludge was low (33 mL/g VS). This
could be because of the occurrence of a lesser or inconsequential amount of freely accessi-
ble substrate.
The methane production for the control sludge had a lag period of eight days, and this
prolonged lag phase may be because of the deliberate hydrolysis of the substrate. Two
separate exponential methane production phases were observed for the MW, MW/H 2O2,
and MW/ H 2O2/acid-pretreated sludges. The first exponential phase persisted for 6 /C010,
5/C07, and 4 /C06 days of operation in the MW, MW/H 2O2, and MW/H 2O2/acid-pretreated
sludge, respectively. The initial exponential increase in the biogas production is because of
the presence of the readily available soluble organic compounds that are converted into
biogas under anaerobic digestion. Among various samples, the MW/H 2O2/acid-pre-
treated sludge exhibited an early start of the first exponential phase; thereby, indicating a
better hydrolysis of the substrate. The first exponential phase was followed by a transi-
tional lag period. The second exponential increase was associated with the degradation of
the nonsoluble particulate organic matter and it extended from 7 /C016, 8/C017, and 11 /C020
days for the MW/H 2O2/acid, MW/H 2O2, and MW-pretreated sludges, respectively.231 8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTTwo different models were used for MW, (the MW/H 2O2, MW/H 2O2/acid-pretreated
samples), to simulate the two observed exponential phases. The first one was the exponen-
tial model and was applied to model the first exponential increase in methane production
(ranging from 0 to 5 days of digestion). The experimental data were found to be in agree-
ment with the goodness of fit prominent for the combined MW-pretreated samples. The
higher values of R2, reveal the goodness of fit for all the experimental data with the pro-
posed models and thereby, indicating a positive correlation between the model and experi-
ment. A second model is the logistic model, and it was used to model the second
exponential increase in the biogas production (10 /C030 days). The model fit for the control
sludge was made with a modified Gompertz equation, as no phase separation was evident
in the control. The kinetic parameters for all the models were evaluated using nonlinear
regression. It was observed that the rate constant K for the MW/H 2O2/acid-pretreated
sample was higher (0.77 day21) than the control (0.2054 day21) and MW (0.426 day21). The
ultimate methane yield (P) for the control was found to be very low (150.3 mL/g VS)
because of the lack of easy accessibility of the substrate to the methanogens. The high
rate constant for MW/H 2O2/acid was attributed to more SCOD release. Similarly, the
maximum rate of methane production and methane production potential was found to
be higher. In contrast, the lag time for the MW/H 2O2/acid was less (2.3 days) than the
other treatment methods and the control (8.3 days) because of the readily available sub-
strate for degradation
Great amounts of residual H 2O2in pretreated sludge after MW/H 2O2pretreatment
resulted in inhibitory effect on sludge anaerobic digestion in the initial days of BMP tests.
Besides, more refractory compounds were generated after pretreatment with high H 2O2
dosage (0.6 and 1.0 g H 2O2/g TS). These negative effects gave rise to a long lag phase, low
methane production rate, and no enhancement of cumulative methane production, even
though high COD solubilization was achieved after MW/H 2O2pretreatment. The residual
H2O2had a serious inhibitory effect on metabolic activity of methanogens and inhibited
hydrolysis-acidification stage of anaerobic digestion mildly. Low dosage of H 2O2such as
0.2 g H 2O2/g TS in MW/H 2O2pretreatment process was appropriate for enhancing anaer-
obic digestion. The cumulative methane production was increased by 29.02% compared
with the control. Moreover, decomposition of the residual H 2O2by catalyst can relieve the
inhibitory effect on enhanced anaerobic digestion ( Liu et al., 2015a,b ).
The estimation of biological methane production at mesophilic temperature
(33/C14C62/C14C) is a suitable information source about both initial and accumulative methane
production. Comparison of results showed that reduction of organic matters and methane
productions under MW/H 2O2has been remarkable ( Eskicioglu et al., 2008 ).
The first order anaerobic biodegradation constants (K, d21) as well as the coefficient of
determination (R2) is used to determine the relationship between measured and predicted
accumulative biogas production ( Eskicioglu et al., 2008 ).
Among three different sludge samples, that is, anaerobic digested sludge, primary
sludge, and activated sludge, it was clear that the highest MW toxicity was observed in
activated sludge, anaerobic digested sludge, and primary sludge respectively; while, con-
ventional heating sludge samples did not indicate any toxicity. Based on previous studies,
this toxicity has been produced due to leaching sludge substances to soluble phase
(,0.45 μm) after MW irradiation ( Eskicioglu et al., 2006 ).232 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTResults have shown the trend of the accumulative biogas curve under different pro-
cesses of MW, MW/H 2O2,and control systems has an increasing trend because in all of
the pretreatment types, all biogas curves had three separate phases (from 1 /C012, 12 /C020,
and 20 /C030 days) indicating three different substances and biogas accumulations ( Fig. 8.6 )
(Eskicioglu et al., 2008 ).
8.3.4 Effect Of H 2O2on Anaerobic Sludge Pretreatment
H2O2as an oxidant has a favorable effect on anaerobic sludge pretreatment. It was clear
that among other oxidants, H 2O2had been a cost effective oxidant ( Ya-Wei et al., 2015 ).
TheOH (with 2.8 eV) produced from H 2O2could react rapidly and non-selectively with
many refractory pollutants. This reduces the treatment time and enhances the solubiliza-
tion plausibly ( Kato et al., 2014; Steriti et al., 2014 ). The effects of the H 2O2concentration
on COD solubilization, soluble protein, and carbohydrate have been investigated ( Eswari
et al., 2016 ) and it was clear that up to 0.3 mg/g SS of H 2O2dosage, the concentration of
protein, carbohydrate, and SCOD release have been increased and the corresponding
values were observed to be 1.52, 0.045, and 12.35 g/L, respectively.
A further increase in H 2O2concentration decreases the release of soluble organics. For
example, an increase in H 2O2dosage from 0.3 to 0.4 mg/g SS causes a decrease in COD
solubilization from 12.35 to 11.56 g/L. A similar kind of decrease was also observed for
the release of soluble organics. This was because of the fact that higher concentrations of
H2O2lead to the scavenging ofOH radicals and, as a result, the release of HO 2will occur
by the following equations:
H2O21/C15OH-HO/C15
21H2O (8.7)
HO/C15
21/C15OH-H2O1O2 (8.8)
It is important to note that HO 2is less reactive thanOH and thus an increasing con-
centration of hydrogen peroxide resulted in a diminished reaction rate ( Herney-Ramirez
et al., 2010 ). Therefore, 0.3 mg/g SS of H 2O2was found to be the optimum dosage for
sludge solubilization when it was combined with MW.
Although MW/H 2O2pretreatment of sludge for enhancing anaerobic digestion has
been investigated in several studies, there are still many questions that need to be
answered. These are:
What is the appropriate H 2O2dosage in pretreatment for enhancing sludge anaerobic
digestion?
What is the mechanism of the inhibitory effect?
Is there a method to control the inhibitory effect and further improve the performance
of sludge anaerobic digestion?
8.3.5 Inhibitory Effects on Microbial Methabolism
The residual H 2O2in pretreated sludge would possibly damage the microbial cells or
inhibit the microbial metabolism of anaerobic digestion. The initial methane production233 8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcould reveal the biodegradation rate and toxicity of tested samples relative to the control.
The cumulative final methane production gave valuable information on ultimate biode-
gradability. H 2O2, known as one of the toxic forms of oxygen, could damage protein,
lipids, and DNA components in organisms. H 2O2was capable of inhibiting the growth of
pathogenic bacteria ( Zhao et al., 1998 ). As a highly active biocide at a concentration of 30
to 1000 mg/L, H 2O2can inhibit the bioactivity of microbial cells and has a lethal effect on
many bacteria ( Jiang and Yuan, 2013 ). Due to the inhibitory effect with excessive H 2O2
addition in pretreatment, low methane yield rate was obtained at 0.6 and 1.0 g H 2O2/g TS,
respectively. The maximum methane yield rate was observed in the anaerobic digestion of
pretreated sludge with the H 2O2dosage of 0.2 g H 2O2/g TS, which was slightly higher
than the control. After the 30 day BMP tests, the cumulative methane production (P) was
significantly improved with MW/H 2O2pretreatment at low dosage of H 2O2(0.2 g H 2O2/g
TS), 29.02% higher than the control. Although the similar concentration of soluble organics
was released, no enhancement of cumulative methane production was obtained with high
H2O2dosage (0.6 and 1.0 g H 2O2/g TS) pretreatment. These results revealed that the
refractory soluble organics were generated at high H 2O2dosage pretreatment. Increasing
sludge solubilization does not always result in enhanced anaerobic digestion.
8.3.6 Regression Model Optimizing H 2O2
A MW/H 2O2process for sludge pretreatment exhibited high efficiencies of releasing
organics, nitrogen, and phosphorus, but large quantities of H 2O2residues were detected.
A uniform design method was thus employed to further optimize H 2O2dosage by investi-
gating effects of pH and H 2O2dosage on the amount of H 2O2residue and releases of
organics, nitrogen, and phosphorus. A regression model was established with pH and
H2O2dosage as the independent variables, and H 2O2residue and releases of organics,
nitrogen, and phosphorus as the dependent variables ( Xiao et al., 2012 ).
Therefore, the released TOC, TP, TN, and the residual H 2O2after sludge pretreatment
by the MW/H 2O2process were set as optimization indices. The optimization directions of
the released TOC, TP, and TN were set as positive and that of the residual H 2O2was set
as negative. Eq. (8.9) was established:
Z5Z11Z21Z3/C0Z4 (8.9)
where, Z 1,Z2,Z3, and Z 4are the indices of TOC, TP, TN, and H 2O2-res, respectively
(Xiao et al., 2012 ). Based on regression model ( Eq. 8.10 ), the optimal values of solution
were obtained as 3(pH value) 511, y (H 2O2: MLSS ratio) 50.2. This result showed the
optimized operational conditions of the MW/H 2O2advanced oxidation process for sludge
pretreatment as follows: the pH value of the sludge was first adjusted to 11.0, then the
sludge was heated to 80/C14C with microwave irradiation, and H 2O2was dosed at a H 2O2:
/MLSS ratio of 0.2, and finally the sludge was continuously heated to 100/C14C with micro-
wave irradiation.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTTo explain the regression model, an analysis of the H 2O2residual concentration (H 2O2-
res) was selected as an example. As shown in ( Eq. 8.10 ), H 2O22resas the dependent vari-
able (z) was fitted to the pH value and H 2O2: MLSS ratio as independent variables x and
y, respectively, and the values of P 12P9were28.4 E10.5, 3.7 E 10.5,25.77 E10.4, 3.29
E10.3, and 1.99 E 20.2, respectively.
Obviously, the z value (e.g. H 2O2-res, TOC, and IC) can be predicted for non-test point
combinations of the independent variables (x, y) within their defined ranges by Eq. (8.10) .
In order to investigate the accuracy of the re gression model, several combinations of
independent variables (x, y) within the ranges were selected for validation tests, and the
calculated values (z) were compared with the experimental values. The average of the
ratios of the calculated values to the experimental values was 0.9946, indicating the high
accuracy of the regression model. As shown in Fig. 8.7 ,t h eH 2O22resconcentration
decreased with the increased pH value and the decreased H 2O2: MLSS ratio. However,
the H 2O2: MLSS ratio had more significant impact on the H 2O22resconcentration. As
shown in Fig. 8.7 , the results clearly showed that all concentrations of TOC, NH 41-N,
PO432-P, TN, and TP increased with increases in both the pH value and H 2O2:M L S S
ratio. At the same H 2O2dosage, a high pH value improved the release efficiencies of
organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus. For the same pH value, concentrations of
TOC, NH 41-N, PO 432-P, TN, and TP were increased with increasing pH and H 2O2:
MLSS ratio.
Yu et al. (2010) found that, organic matter was increased with the increase of H 2O2dos-
age at the same temperature and then decreased as further increase of H 2O2dosage.
Therefore, it was clear that optimization of H 2O2dosage is necessary for MW/H 2O2pro-
cess. MW/H 2O2process was developed by using novel H 2O2dosing strategy.
The reasons of a more oxidative effect of H 2O2under MW/H 2O2and alkaline pH
include prevention of catalase activity (H 2O2:H2O2oxidoreductase) over 40/C14C and alkaline
conditions. Catalase presented in all aerobic living cells is able to breakdown H 2O2in
water and oxygen; thus, it plays the protective role for cells against reactive oxygen spe-
cies damages. Maximum catalase activity occurred at pH 7; the catalase active was sud-
denly decreased with increase in both pH and temperature, resulting in little
decomposition of H 2O2by catalase ( Fig. 8.8 ). H 2O2is unstable under alkaline pH and
therefore, produces hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide ions (O 22) that are more
effective on organic matter decomposition than H 2O2itself. Additionally, if the tempera-
ture is in the range of 60/C14C/C080/C14C, theOH production from H 2O2decomposition will also
be increased.
Although some studies have focused on improving the lysis efficiency of sludge pre-
treated by microwave and combined processes, few studies are centered on decreasing the
cost of microwave and combined processes for sludge pretreatment, such as saving dosage
of the chemical by optimizing these processes. A new H 2O2dosing strategy for sludge pre-
treatment by MW/H 2O2was developed considering pretreatment sensitive catalase.
Xiao et al. (2012) observe that the effects of oxidation and disintegration caused by
H2O2and/orOH have been increased at pH 11 by MW/H 2O2. In this condition, cell wall
and membrane reactions with radicals occurred in a variety of ways. Saponification
between the alkali and fatty acids of cell membranes can change the permeability of cell
membranes and damage the cell wall or structure of the membranes. In a summary, the236 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES

the release of particulate organic matter, but also promotes the decomposition of H 2O2
intoOH and O 2(Fig. 8.9 )(Erdincler and Vesilind, 2000 ).
Organic matters transform to inorganic matters, under MW/H 2O2process, due to the

organic compounds except small parts of them, which are mineralized into CO 2.
With decreasing H 2O2: MLSS ratio from 1 to 0.5, the percentage of H 2O2-residues
decreased from 63.5% to 41%, the SCOD decreased from 4158 to 3168 mg/L and SCOD
release rate decreased from 38.2% to 29%, whereas the concentration of NH 4-N, PO 432-P,
and soluble total phosphorus (STP) all increased (e.g. NH 41-N, increased from 8.76 to
27.25 mg/L, and STP increased from 26.74 to 43.49 mg/L). When the H 2O2: MLSS ratio
was optimized at 0.2 and pH was kept at 11, the release SCOD concentration and rate
from the sludge were 3223 mg/L and 29.5%, respectively.
TSS, H 2O2concentrations, and pH are known to be the critical factors controlling sludge
disintegration at mild temperatures (100/C14C) under MW/H 2O2; however, the effect of pH
(from acidic to basic) and the interactions among these factors have not yet been fully rec-
ognized. Moreover, the majority of workers have focused on the treatment of target
sludge, but neglecting the behavior of oxidant H 2O2during this process. In practical engi-
neering application of this technology, it is always designed to achieve multiobjectives for
the sludge disintegration unit.
It has been predicted that SCOD can be estimated with the Eq. (8.11) :

Where, TSS, pH, and H 2O2to sludge ratio are represented by X 1,X2, and X 3, respec-
tively ( Veschetti et al., 2000 ).
Multivariate analysis to investigate sludge disintegration is aimed:
to investigate the effects of pH, H 2O2dosage and interactions among these factors
during sludge disintegration and,
to construct analyzing of the model to predict sludge solubilization and H 2O2usage;
thus, providing a simple way to estimate optimal values for multiple sludge
pretreatment objectives.
8.3.7 Effect of pH on Anaerobic Sludge Pretreatment
The pH of the MW/H 2O2-pretreated sludge has been found to be in the range of 9.5 to
10. The increase in pH after pretreatment was due to the formation of ammonia (produced
by the degradation of protein) ( Luo et al., 2012 ). A similar observation was found by Rani
et al. (2013) . This highly alkaline nature of pretreated sludge makes it unattractive towards
subsequent anaerobic digestion. Healthy anaerobic digestion happens in the pH range of
6.8 to 7.5 ( Rani et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2008 ). In addition, the performance of H 2O2was
observed to be effective at pH 5 and a final pH of 7 was attained after pretreatment. In
order to make this alkaline sludge amenable for anaerobic digestion, it has to be neutral-
ized with acid. This leads to an idea of combining acidic pH with MW/H 2O2, with an
interest focused towards the final pH of sludge.
Hong et al. ( 2012, 2015 ) have reported thatOH radicals of H 2O2performed well under
acidic pH, and as a result, the efficiency of H 2O2has been improved for a further disinte-
gration process. Keeping this in mind, it was planned to maintain an acidic condition in239 8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTthe medium to enhance the disintegration efficiency of MW/H 2O2pretreatment. It is evi-
dent that the MW/H 2O2pretreatment efficiency was increased by decreasing the pH of
the sludge. The soluble organics and soluble COD release were found to be higher at pH 2
and 3. However, the final pH of the pretreated sludge at this condition was found to be
3.12 and 4.18. This makes the process less attractive as it demands neutralization of the
sludge for subsequent aerobic or anaerobic biodegradation. Rani et al. (2014) reported that
the efficient degradation of organic matter was possible at the optimum pH of 6.3 /C07.8,
whereas at lower and higher pH conditions, the methanogenic activity in anaerobic diges-
tion will be slow and the biogas production is decreased.
It was found that the combined microwave/H 2O2treatment of sewage sludge followed
by acid hydrolysis treatment (a two-stage process) resulted in significantly greater yields
of soluble phosphates and ammonia; in which up to 61% of the total phosphorus was
solubilized and 36% of the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) was solubilized as ammonia
(Liao et al., 2006 ).
The dairy industry is one of the largest sources of the food processing industries that
produces a huge amount of waste activated sludge with diverse characteristics. The main
advantage of MW pretreatment is the effective disintegration of sludge biomass, which
further enhances the biogas production efficiently. The main drawback of this pretreat-
ment is high energy consumption. MW/H 2O2pretreatment was combined with the acid to
maintain the sludge pH during disintegration in order to make it more amenable for sub-
sequent anaerobic digestion. Thus, the effect of MW pretreatment using low specific
energy to disintegrate the sludge particles has been investigated by applying microwave
radiation and oxidation of organic molecules by H 2O2at different pH.
Kim et al. (2013) observed that the soluble fraction obtained under mild pretreatment
conditions (pH 59 and ultrasonication for 5 min) achieved 91 % methane yield of soluble
fraction, while only 61% methane yield of soluble fraction was obtained at of pH 513 and
ultrasonication for 60 min.
Eswari et al. (2016) conducted a study on sludge anaerobic biodegradability by com-
bined MW/H 2O2pretreatment in acidic conditions. They found that the application of
MW/H 2O2in acidic condition was led to decreasing specific energy consumption.
8.3.8 Fate of Organic Matters
One of the major factors affecting anaerobic sludge pretreatment efficiency by MW/
H2O2is study of the fate of organic matters. The activated sludge can be classified into
four parts as residual solids, particles in suspension (after 30 min settling), soluble sub-
stances, and CO 2depending on the achievement of disintegration, solubilizaton, and min-
eralization under MW/H 2O2. Study of Wang et al. (2009) shows the changes of these four
parts using their distribution in TCOD ( Fig. 8.11 ).
It has been observed that nearly all TCOD contents in untreated sludge are distributed
on solids that are similar to the sludge pretreated by ozonation. Along with the increasing
H2O2/TCOD ratio in the activated sludge pretreated by MW/H 2O2, the contents of TCOD
on particles, soluble substances, and mineralization also increased, but TCOD distribution
on solids decreased. Contents of TCOD on particles, soluble organic matters, and240 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTmineralization were found to increase from 1.04, 10.16, and 0 in waste activated sludge
pretreated only by MW without H 2O2, respectively, to 8.69%, 35.59%, and 14.48% of four
H2O2/TCOD ratios in the sludge pretreated by MW/H 2O2. The contents of TCOD on
residual solids were correspondingly decreased from 88.78% to 41.23%. With increasing
H2O2/TCOD ratio between 0.1 and 1, the amount of soluble organic matters and particles
significantly increased, but the amount of mineralization was relatively small, less than
5%. However, the rate of mineralization increased faster than those of solubilization at
H2O2dosage (ratios of 2 H 2O2/TCOD and 4 H 2O2/TCOD ratio were 0.12 times to that at
0.1 of H 2O2/TCOD ratio was as high 5.65 times of that at 0.1 H 2O2/TCOD ratio)
(Fig. 8.10 )(Eskicioglu et al., 2008 ).
8.3.9 Morphological Changes of Sludge
Floc characteristics (morphology) is one of the tests monitored along the digestion test.
Digested sludge shows a greater flow in the steady state and less elasticity in the linear
viscoelastic region. This phenomenon is due to weak colloidal forces in the internal struc-
ture or a less rigid structure. Activated sludge and digested sludge are mainly composed
of water, organic matters, microbial cells, and extracellular polymeric substances, which
tend to aggregate, forming flocs. The characteristics of the adsorption ability, hydrophilic-
ity/hydrophobicity, and content of the main components, such as proteins and polysac-
charides of EPS critically affect the properties of microbial aggregates, e.g. mass transfer,
surface characteristics, and stability.
By MW/H 2O2pretreatment ,the color of sludge has been changed from original dark-
brown to pale and the bulk solution has been changed to green after a 5 min treatment,
gradually with the increased dosage of H 2O2(Fig. 8.11A ). Compared to the agglomeratedSludge

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTfloc in raw sludge shown in Fig. 8.11B , little morphological changes of sludge flocs
occurred in the sludge pretreated by MW in absence of H 2O2(Fig. 8.11C ), but the cells in
the sludge were completely destroyed by MW/H 2O2, with the breakage of the cell mem-
brane and no whole cell was observed ( Fig. 8.11D ). Although the cell in the sludge pre-
treated by MW/H 2O2was totally broken, the percentage of organic matter released into
the supernatant was not over 40%. It is regarded that MW heating process could break
down particles with or without H 2O2. However, it is also noted that sludge flocs in the
sludge pretreated only by MW without H 2O2were not completely disintegrated because
of short time heating below 100/C14C. Obviously, the MW/H 2O2is effective to disintegrate
sludge and release cytoplasm into bulk solution through breaking the cell membrane
(Wang et al., 2009 ).
8.3.10 Improvement Of EPS Extraction From Anaerobic Sludge
The efficacies of extracting extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from aerobic, acido-
genic, and methanogenic sludges using ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), cation
exchange resin and formaldehyde under various conditions have been compared. Results

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTshow that formaldehye plus NaOH was the most effective in extracting EPS for all
sludges. All EPS were mainly composed of carbohydrate, protein, and humic substance,
plus small quantities of uronic acid and DNA. Carbohydrate is predominant in the acid-
genic sludge. Nowadays, optimization of extraction procedures and/or development of a
more effective extraction method is necessary ( Fang and Liu, 2002 ).
Base on the study of Lio et al. (2007) MW/H 2O2pretreatment is a suitable method for
increasing the amount of ESP extraction by the formaldehyde-NaOH extraction method
from anaerobic sludge.
According to the analysis of EPS ( Fig. 8.12A ), large amounts of soluble EPS existed in
the digested sludge of reactors that received the pretreatment compared with that of the
control, whereas the concentrations of bound EPS were relatively the same for the different
reactors. In the soluble EPS, the amounts of proteins and polysaccharides were obviously
higher than those of the digested sludge of the control reactor ( Fig. 8.12B ). The concentra-
tions of proteins and polysaccharides in the bound EPS did not present obvious differ-
ences ( Fig. 8.12C ). Moreover, it was found that pretreatment partly changed the
proportion of proteins and polysaccharides in EPS ( Fig. 8.12D ). The ratio of proteins to

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTpolysaccharides in bound EPS decreased when the feeding sludge underwent MW/H 2O2
pretreatment. In addition, the ratio of proteins to polysaccharides in both soluble EPS and
bound EPS presented the lowest value in the digested sludge from the MW-two stage
reactor. These results imply that MW/H 2O2pretreatment strongly affected the concentra-
tion and components of EPS in digested sludge. Furthermore, it was observed that the
molecular weight of the soluble organic matter in digested sludge was influenced by pre-
treatment. The pretreatment process resulted in a greater amount of soluble organic matter
released at molecular weights lower than 20 kDa. In addition, the morphology of digested
sludge was partly changed due to pretreatment, which was included in the supporting
information. It seems that the microbial cells were less tightly embedded in sludge flocs
when the pretreated sludge fed into the digesters.
8.3.11 Thermodynamic Analysis of WAS Hydrolysis
The thermal disintegration of sludge offers more advantages over other methods of
sludge pretreatment. There are different thermal disintegrations, such as moist heat, dry
heat, and radiation heat, which are available to disintegrate sludge ( Wilson and Novak,
2009, Gianico et al., 2013 ). In thermal treatment, the possible solubilization cannot be
achieved at a lower treatment time, whereas a prolonged treatment time leads to the for-
mation of refractory organic compounds that limit the rate of degradation ( Rani et al.,
2013). In MW pretreatment, the treatment time is comparatively lower and the possible
solubilization is achieved at a lower treatment time. Considering this fact, the MW pre-
treatment is considered to be more efficient than thermal treatment, the basis of the reac-
tion activation energy. This can be done by using first-order kinetic modeling, which
contributes to the traditional simplification of substrate biodegradation in terms of the
SCOD release. The effect of MW irradiation on dairy sludge hydrolysis has been simplified
to single first-order kinetics, based on the following equations ( Eswari et al., 2016 ):
2dS=dT5kS (8.12)
Ln S52kt1b (8.13)
where S denotes the SCOD concentration, k is the rate concentration, and b is the constant
of integration.
By plotting ln S versus t, the slope and intercept could be obtained, which correspond
to the values of k and b, respectively. The regression for ln S versus t can be obtained at
different temperatures ( Eswari et al., 2016 ) by the thermodynamic analysis. The activation
energy was calculated from the following equation:
Ln5Ea=RT1ln A (8.14)
where A is the preexponential factor, E a(kJ/mol) is the reaction activation energy, T (/C14K)
is the absolute temperature, and R is the gas constant (8.31 K/mol). The value of the pre-
exponential factor has been found to be 0.4 98 and the reaction activation energy for
SCOD release in the pretreated MW and contr ol (thermally pretreated) has been evalu-
ated to be 0.135 and 0.598 kJ/mol, respectively. The currently achieved activation,
0.135 kJ/mol, is lower than that achieved in other studies, where researchers achieved244 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT20.19 kJ/mol ( Luo et al., 2012 ) in the enzymatic treatment of sludge, which therefore sug-
gests that MW irradiation increases the rate of chemical reaction largely by lowering the
activation energy. Thus, the MW technique has been found efficient for effective sludge
solubilization.
Contrary, thermal and chemical reactions from MW/H 2O2have some disadvantages.
For example, the fraction of pretreated sludge, which is soluble but not convertible to
methane, increases from 2.4% to 25.8% in sludge under severe pretreatment conditions.
Due to MW or conventional heating pretreatment (at 96/C14C), slightly lower rate constants
(k) of soluble organics degradation have been observed ( Eskicioglu et al., 2006 ). Bougrier
et al. (2007) also has reported that the soluble protein removal rate decreases from 75% for
the control to only 68% due to thermal pretreatment at 190/C14C. The formation of refractory
compounds such as melanoidines from Maillard reactions is the most possible explanation
to account for these results ( Pilli et al., 2015, Wilson and Novak, 2009 ).
8.3.12 Cost Analysis of Anaerobic Sludge Pretreatment
As low energy input is desirable, the calculation of specific energy (SE) becomes
inevitable for evaluating the cost of pretreatment. SE was completed, based on Eq. (8.15)
(Ebenezer et al., 2015a,b ):
Specific energy ðKj=Kg TS Þ5Power of microwave ðKWÞ3Irradiation ðSÞ
Sample volume ðLÞ3Total solids ðKg=LÞ(8.15)
Theoretical energy balances and cost assessment have been performed for pilot scale
reactors with the obtained experimental data to assess the potency of pretreatment meth-
ods. The estimation has been performed for 1 L of sludge based on the previous study.
The theoretical calculation for methane was carried out based on the COD consumed with
the following equation:
CH 4production ðm3Þ5COD consumed ðkgÞ3ð0:35 m3=kg COD Þ
3Biodegradability ð0:28Þ(8.16)
Methane production assesses the level of biodegradability of a substrate (COD) con-
sumed. Output energy (E o) is calculated based on methane production and estimated by
following the equation ( Passos and Ferrer, 2014 ):
Eo5ρCH 4ξVη (8.17)
where E ois the output energy (KJ/day), ρCH 4is the methane production rate (m3CH 4/m3
day), ξis the lower heating energy value of methane (KJ/m3methane), V is the useful vol-
ume (m3), and ηis the energy conversion efficiency (90%).
To calculate the energy applied, the energy spent for sludge pretreatment by MW is
arrived at by using COD solubilization as an index based on the following equation:
QMWðkWhÞ5ðPMW3TÞ
V3SS(8.18)245 8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTwhere Q MWis the energy spent for sludge pretreatment in kilowatt-hour, P MWis the
power of microwave (31 kWh), T is the time, and V is the volume of pilot scale plant (L).
Energy spent for pumping and stirring in anaerobic digestion.
Qpwas calculated as per the calculation detailed by ( Metcalf et al., 2003 ). The energy
required in upsurging the temperature is calculated by following equation:
QT5P3ð100 =PsÞ3ðTd2TsÞ3ð1=2Þ3Cp (8.19)
where p is the fresh dry sludge solids added per day (kg), Ps is the percentage dry solids in
the fresh sludge (%), T dand T sare the temperatures of digester and sludge, respectively
(/C14C), and Cp is the specific heat constant (4200 J//C14C). The heat required to make up for
losses at the top, walls, and bottom (Q L) is estimated by the following equation:
QL5CA3ΔT (8.20)
where C is the coefficient of heat flow (J/m2/h//C14C), A is the surface area (m2), and Δis
the difference between tank temperature and temperature of outside material.
The total input energy is subtracted from the output energy to confirm the energy bal-
ance ( ΔE) and assay the net energy production, based on the following equation ( Passos
and Ferrer, 2014 ):
E5Eo2ðEi;heat1Ei;electricity Þ (8.21)
Where ΔE is the energy balance, E ois the output energy, E i, heat is the input heat
energy, and E i, electricity is the input electricity.
One of the benefits associated with the anaerobic digestion of pretreated sludge is the
production of fuel gas in the form of methane. Based on biodegradability (0.28), 38.3 m3of
methane is obtained per liter of sludge. The COD solubilization of all pretreated sludge is
the same; hence, the methane production also remains the same (381 kWh). The energy
cost of methane is calculated as 0.187 hper kWh of energy, and it remains the same for all
types of pretreatment. Similar to methane, the cost savings can be obtained by reducing
the SS to be disposed. This could occur because anaerobic biodegradability remains the
same for the substrate with a similar amount of COD solubilization ( Saha et al., 2011 ).
The energy consumed for sludge pumping and mixing in the anaerobic digester is cal-
culated to be 96 kWh for all treatment processes. Energy required to raise the temperature
of the sludge to the digester temperature and energy required to make up losses through
top, walls, and bottom of the digester is calculated to be 25 and 0.674 kWh, respectively.
Gravity thickener is used for thickening of sludge. Energy consumed for this process is
assessed to be 13.6 kWh. The energy spent for biogas purification and compression is 1.4
and 1.1 kWh, respectively. Therefore, the total input energy is estimated to be 749.8, 545.7,
and 341.7 kWh for MW, MW/H 2O2, and MW/H 2O2/acid pretreatment. The energy con-
sumed for sludge pumping and mixing in the anaerobic digester is calculated to be 95.4
kWh for all treatment processes. The cost of H 2O2and H 2SO4used for the combined disin-
tegration is also considered. In an economic analysis, the capital investment for sludge
pretreatment is not considered. The results suggested that the MW/ H 2O2/acid is the
most economically feasible method with a net profit of 59.90 h/t of sludge. Pilot scale
experiments with these optimized conditions and more realistic energy consideration are
strongly recommended in the future.246 8. MICROWAVE/HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT8.3.13 Impact of MW Specific Energy on Anaerobic Sludge Pretreatment
The specific energy is considered as an essential factor for determining the economic
feasibility and energy consumption of MW pretreatment.
It has been observed that the changes of soluble organic release (SCOD, protein, and
carbohydrate) could be distinguished into two phases, i.e., a rapid release phase and a
slower degradation phase. Phase 1 starts from a specific energy input of 0 to 18,600 kJ/kg
TS while phase 2 continues from a specific energy input of 18,600 to 30,000 kJ/kg TS.
The specific energy increase from 0 to 18,600 kJ/kg TS led to a rapid release of soluble
organics (SCOD, protein, and carbohydrate in phase 1 ( Eswari et al., 2016 ).
As a result of cell wall disintegration, the extracellular and intracellular cytoplasmic
materials both start to be released into the soluble phase ( Rani et al., 2013 ). This could be
the reason for an increment in the soluble organics in phase 1. The amount of changes of
the concentrations of SCOD, protein, and carbohydrate are 7.4, 0.7, and 0.05 g/L, respec-
tively. Further increasing the specific energy input beyond 18,600 kJ/kg TS not only
decreases the solubilization percentage but also increases the treatment cost. In phase 2,
degradation of soluble organics is decreased due to the loss of organics by evaporation
(Ebenezer et al., 2015a,b ). It is confirmed that high specific energy does not lead to increas-
ing solubilization ( Park et al., 2010 ).
In contrast to the pattern of soluble organic release, the SS removal exhibits a stabilizing
pattern at phase 2. During phase 1, SS removal is gradual and from the initial value of
19 g/L, it is reduced to 15 g/L. Beyond the specific energy of 18,600 kJ/kg TS, the SS
reduction is relatively slower and nearly stable. This could be because of the condensation
of sludge. At elevated MW energy, the evaporation of water occurs, which results in the
condensation of sludge. The increase in energy input also increases the temperature of the
medium or sludge, leading to a loss of organics because of evaporation ( Eswari et al.,
2016). Many researchers have employed a cover to avoid evaporation loss ( Eskicioglu
et al., 2007, Rani et al., 2013 ).
On increasing the specific energy input beyond 18,600 kJ/Kg TS, the evaporation loss
has been observed to be 20% /C025%, which is relatively higher than that observed in the
optimal specific energy input while only a slight increment in SS reduction was observed.
The currently achieved SS reduction at the optimal specific energy of 18,600 kJ/kg TS is
found to be 21%. By almost doubling the specific energy input to 30,000 kJ/kg TS, only a
relatively slight increment in SS reduction (22.7%) is obtained. Therefore, it can be con-
cluded that an increment in specific energy beyond 18,600 kJ/kg TS is not economically
feasible. On the basis of these outcomes, it can be concluded that the specific energy input
of 18,600 kJ/kg TS is considered optimum, and this optimal specific energy is employed
for further studies ( Eswari et al., 2016 ).
8.3.14 Release of Heavy Metals
The reduction of heavy metals in sewage sludge can be achieved by source control of
discharge to sewer systems by removing metals from sludge. In source control, the major
difficulty is identification of sources. Moreover, even with complete elimination of toxic247 8.3 ENHANCEMENT OF SLUDGE ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADABILITY
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTmetals from all industrial discharges to sewers, the problem remains because of metal con-
tent of domestic wastewaters. Several chemical methods for solubilization of heavy metals
for sewage sludge have been suggested ( Tyagi et al., 1988 ).
It is observed that MW/H 2O2is able to release metals from anaerobic sludge ( Wang
et al., 2014 ).
Wang et al. (2014) studied the release behavior of heavy metals during treatment of
dredged sediment by MW/H 2O2(using a series of 150 mL round bottom flasks containing
560.0005 g sediment and 50 mL ultrapure water) ( Fig. 8.13 ).
Estimated recovery percent of heavy metals is given by Eq. (8.22) (Wang et al., 2014 ):
Recovery ð%Þ5F11F21F31F4
TCHM(8.22)
where F1, F2, F3, and F4 refer to the concentration of heavy metals in acid soluble/
exchangeable, reducible, oxidizable, and residual form, respectively. TCHM is the total
concentration of heavy metals of raw/extracted sediment.
Under the four treatment methods (control, MW, H 2O2,and MW/H 2O2), amounts of
recovery percent of four metals of Cu, Cd, Zn, and Pb have been calculated. A comparison
between these groups indicates that the presence of H 2O2could remarkably enhance the
release efficiency for the heavy metals.
H2O2concentration higher than 0.2 M does not affect recovery of heavy metals. This is
due to consumption ofOH radical by H 2O2and generation of HO 2radical, which is less
reactive. This reaction occurred follows: ( Wang et al., 2014 )

The mobility of heavy metals generally reduces in the following order:

Heavy metals in the form of F1 and F2 show high bioavailability and direct eco-toxicity.
By increasing the oxidation /C0reduction potential (ORP) and decreasing the final pH of
sediment slurry, MW/H 2O2enhances the release of heavy metals from sediment.
8.3.15 Effects of MW/H 2O2Pretreatment on Anaerobic Sludge Rheology
Rheology is the study of flow and deformation of materials under applied forces that
are usually measured using a rheometer. The measurement of rheological properties is
applicable to all materials (fluids, solids, and semi-solids such as sludge).
Liu et al. (2016a) have investigated the changes in the rheological characteristics of
sludge under MW/H 2O2pretreatment during enhanced anaerobic digestion with micro-
wave/H 2O2pretreatment. For AD, the rheological properties of sludge play key roles in
processes such as mixing, pumping, and recirculating ( Liu et al., 2016b ).
The rheograms of raw sludge and pretreated sludge are presented in Fig. 8.14A . The
shear stress increased nonlinearly with the increase of the shear rate, which suggested that
both the raw sludge and pretreated sludge presented non-Newtonian flow. At a low shear
rate, the apparent viscosity decreased with the increasing shear rate, demonstrating a
shear-thinning property. The rheological properties of the sludge within the nonlinear vis-
coelastic region were influenced by the MW/H 2O2pretreatment. In particular, the appar-
ent viscosity decreased obviously, indicating the improvement of sludge flowability.
Moreover, both raw sludge and pretreated sludge presented thixotropic behavior for the
formation of the hysteresis loop. Shear stresses of up-curves were higher than those of

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTdown-curves at the same shear rate. MW/H 2O2pretreatment resulted in the decrease of
the hysteresis area from 11,121.57 Pa/s to 3567.94 Pa/s. The hysteresis area is useful to
evaluate sludge thixotropy ( Yen et al., 2002 ) and decrease in the area indicated that the
thixotropy of sludge weakened. The thixotropic behavior of the sludge suggested that the
kinetic processes of both breakdown and build-up exist when the flow is applied. The hys-
teresis area became small due to pretreatment, indicating that the kinetic processes could
rapidly reach a steady state. In general, activated sludge shows high levels of thixotropy
due to its internal structures ( Liu et al., 2016a ). The colloidal forces among particles tend
to rebuild the structures ( Eshtiaghi et al., 2013 ). Therefore, the decrease of sludge thixot-
ropy with MW/H 2O2pretreatment is possibly the result of the weakness of colloidal
forces among particles. Furthermore, the Herschel-Bulkley model was used to fit the flow
curve, and a strong agreement (R2.0.999) was obtained ( Fig. 8.14B ).
According to the Herschel-Bulkley model, the yield stress ( τy) was taken into account in
the equation, which is regarded to be an indication of the specific value of stress exerted
on the sludge when it begins to flow. With MW/H 2O2pretreatment, the yield stress of
sludge obviously decreased ( Table 8.4 ). The consistency index (k) and flow behavior index
(n) in the Herschel-Bulkley model are two other important parameters. The value of k
decreased from 4.90 to 0.81, and the value of n increased from 0.48 to 0.58. The consistency
index (k) is a measure of average firmness. The decrease of k is consistent with the
decrease of apparent viscosity. The flow behavior index (n) is related to the type of fluids.
Pseudo-plastic fluids present values of n lower than one. The increase of n revealed that
the rheological properties of the pseudo-plastic fluid became weaker, suggesting that the
internal structures of the sludge were broken. This is consistent with the release of soluble
organic matter, such as proteins and polysaccharides, with treatment, which can be an
indication of the degree of sludge flocs rupture ( Liu et al., 2016 ).
One of the major advantages of MW/H 2O2is in increasing sludge flowability and
weakness of sludge solid-like properties, which were beneficial for sludge pumping or
mixing processes. The apparent viscosity of digested sludge in reactors combined with
pretreatment was lower than the control reactor ( Liu et al., 2016b ). Anaerobic digestion is
able to convert large sludge flocs into smaller ones, and cause the disintegration of macro-
molecular organic compounds, such as proteins and polysaccharides into micro-molecular
organics, such as VFAs, which can be further used by methanogens for biogas production.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIt is well known that the rheology of sludge, i.e., apparent viscosity, is associated with the
sludge solid concentration. The low apparent viscosity was perhaps due to the low solid
concentration of digested sludge or may be the result of changes of digested sludge
microstructures.
Microwave/H 2O2system with changes of digested sludge microstructures and
morphology has been found as an environmental friendly method for decreasing and sta-
bilization of environmental pollutions. High efficiency of this process is due to thermal
effects and hydroxyl radical production. Optimizing H 2O2:pollutant factors such as energy
intensity, pH, pollutant concentration (NH 41-N, PO 423-P, TP, TC, SCOD ...), H 2O2concen-
tration, H 2O2residual, radical scavengers’ effects, and others is an engineering technique
for increasing MW/H 2O2efficiency. This technique is not only for deceasing sludge vis-
cosity, energy, and oxidant consumption, but also for breaking the cell walls, increasing
biodegradability of wastewater and anaerobic sludge, methane and VFA production.

9.1 INTRODUCTION
The beginnings of scientific research on using chemical radiation methods for the treat-
ment of waters and wastewaters dates back to the 1950s. Pioneering applications also
began to appear in this period. During the first decade of post WWII rebuilding, there was
a renaissance in the activity of all industrial fields. As this activity grew, it became increas-
ingly clear that there was an important problem associated with the need to protect the
environment (i.e., water resources). The effort was part of the general push for the peace-
ful use of atomic energy following its use in wartime. It was also consistent with the
movement to improve the standard of living at the time.
Pioneering investigations were initiated at MIT in Boston, Massachusetts, using sewage
sterilization by electron beams (EBs) and gamma irradiation ( Dunn, 1953 ). Similar activity
was followed soon after, in several other research institutions in the United States ( Touhill
et al., 1969; Ballantine et al., 1969; Compton et al., 1970 ) and in Canada ( Grant et al., 1969 ).
Some years later similar studies were undertaken in the Soviet Union ( Brusentseva et al.,
1978) and Japan ( Nagai, 1976 ). Some activity in this field was inaugurated by certain
European research groups ( Gehringer and Krenmayr, 1973; Lesse and Suess, 1984;
Perkowski et al., 1984 ). Within two decades it resulted in a rapidly growing number of
original research reports in scientific and technical journals, with the highest activity in the
years 1990 /C02010. During the same period several pilot and large-scale installations were

pal purposes ( Woodbridge et al., 1972; Cleland et al., 1984 ). It has to be emphasized at the
very beginning of this article, that contrary to some special fields of nuclear technology,
none of the radiation techniques discussed herein that are employed for waters and waste-
waters purification induce energy levels, which could affect the natural one.
The basis of the application of ionizing radiation for the decomposition of pollutants
occurring in waters and wastewaters is mostly associated with the reactions of these pollu-
tants with the products of water radiolysis. Direct radiolysis of dissolved compounds (i.e.,
the pollutants) in diluted solutions does not take place. The applications of the radiation
methods described in this chapter can be considered practical successes in the decades of
developments in radiation chemistry. The results of these developments are documented
in thousands of original research works and a wide selection of books or chapters in books
(Cleland et al., 1984; Thomas, 1969; Draganic and Draganic, 1971; Buxton, 1982, 1987, 2008;
von Sonntag, 1987; Bensasson et al., 1993; Richter, 1998; Bobrowski, 2012, 2017; Spinks and
Woods, 1990 ) published in the last half-century.
The radiolysis of water is a relatively easy and convenient way to produce an enormous
variety of highly reactive radical species that otherwise cannot readily be generated by ther-
mal, chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical methods. Formation of the radical cation
(H2O1) and electrons (e2) represents the primary process (ionization) in the radiolysis of
water and can be summarized by the Reaction 9.1 (Buxton, 2008 ):
ð9:1Þ
There is no unequivocal evidence that electronic excitation of water molecules ( Reaction
9.2) plays any significant role in radiolysis of water.
ð9:2Þ
Both processes occur on the time scale of electronic transition, i.e., B10216s. The water rad-
ical cation (H 2O1) immediately loses a proton (in B10214s) to neighboring water molecules
(Reaction 9.3 ), and the electrons ejected in an ionization process ( Reaction 9.1 ) lose gradually
their energy and undergo hydration by B10212s, after thermalization ( Reaction 9.4 ).

At this time, for low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation (X/ γ-rays and fast electrons
from accelerators), the products of Reactions (9.3, 9.4, 9.5) are distributed inhomogen-
eously and located together in small and widely separated volumes called spurs . Before
diffusing apart into the bulk of water, a fraction of them interacts with one another form-
ing molecular and secondary radical products. These spur reactions together with their
respective rate constants are listed in Table 9.1 (Buxton, 1987, 2008 ).258 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe spur reactions and diffusion of reactants leading to their homogeneity are com-
pleted within 1027s. The radiolysis of water (for low LET irradiation B0.23 eV/nm) is
summarized by the Eq. 9.14 :
ð9:14Þ
where the numbers in parentheses represent radiation chemical yields ( G-values) in units
μmol/J ( Buxton, 2008; Spinks and Woods, 1990 ).
The remaining primary and secondary products, which diffuse outside the spurs,
become homogeneously distributed and may react with added solutes acting as radical
scavengers. The effective radiation chemical yields ( G-values) of the primary species avail-
able for the reaction with scavengers depend on their concentrations since at high concen-
tration they can interfere with the spur reactions.
The primary transients from water radiolysis ( Eq. 9.14 ) are involved in the following

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTbulk protons (Reaction 9.8, Table 9.1 ) causes an increase of the yield ofH atoms with
decreasing pH.
Hydroxyl radicals (OH) exist in the acid/base equilibrium ( Eq. 9.16 ) with pKa 511.8
(OH is a conjugate acid of the oxide radical ion (O2)), with kforward (in equilibrium repre-
sented by Eq. 9.16 )51.331010M-1s-1) and kreverse (in equilibrium represented by
Eq. 9.16 )57.93107s21(Weeks and Rabani, 1966 ). Since O2radical anion is very rapidly
protonated by water, its radical reactions occur in a significant extent only at a pH .12.
For a better illustration, the initial radiation chemical yields ( G) of the primary products of
water radiolysis as function of pH are presented in Fig. 9.1 (Getoff, 1996 ).
Redox properties of the primary radicals from water radiolysis can be summarized as fol-
lows: (1) theOH radical is a powerful one-electron oxidant with a reduction potential vary-
ing with the pH (from 11.90 V for the redox coupleOH/2OH to 12.72 V for the redox
coupleOH, H1/H2O), (2) the hydrated electron (e2
aq) is a powerful reductant in neutral and
alkaline solutions with a reduction potential 22.87 V while theHa t o mb e c o m e st h em a j o r
reductant in acidic solutions with a reduction potential 22.31 V. All potentials were mea-
sured versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) ( Buxton et al., 1988; Wardman, 1989 ).
Those statements also lead to a very important conclusion that the radiation treatment may
involve, depending on particulate solute (pollutant), both oxidative and reductive processes.
Therefore, in contrary to many other typical advanced oxidation processes, the radiation
techniques should be considered as advanced oxidation/reduction processes.
Since the primary radicals formed in the radiolysis of water possess both oxidative
(OH) and reductive properties (e2
aq;/C15H), it is of special importance to study the reactions
of individual radicals. These conditions can be achieved via an appropriate design of the
reaction system.
In order to eliminate the contribution of hydrated electrons (e2
aq), the solution is satu-
rated with nitrous oxide (N 2O). Hydrated electrons, e2
aq, are converted intoOH radicals

At pH #4, the diffusion-controlled reaction of e2
aqwith protons (Reaction 8) becomes
important, resulting in a pH-dependent lowered yield ofOH radicals and a correspond-
ingly increased yield ofH atoms.
A good approach to study reactions of e2
aq(without contribution ofOH radicals) is irra-
diation of Ar/N 2-saturated solutions containing high concentration ( .0.1 mol/dm3)o f
2-methyl-2-propanol ( tert-butanol). The highly reactiveOH radicals are scavenged by
tert-butanol ( Reaction 9.18 ) with k1856.03108M-1s-1(Buxton et al., 1988 ):
/C15OH1ðCH 3Þ3C-OH-H2O1/C15CH 2ðCH 3Þ2C-OH (9.18)
The forming 2-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl radical (CH 2(CH 3)2C-OH) is largely unreactive
and its optical absorption spectrum does not interfere with other radical spectra located at
λ.270 nm. The irradiated system contains only e2
aqandH-atoms with the respective
G-values 0.28 and 0.062 μmol/J.
A convenient way to study reactions ofH atoms (without contribution ofOH radicals
and e2
aq) is irradiation of highly acidic Ar/N 2-saturated solutions containing a high concen-
tration ( .0.1.M) of tert-butanol. TheOH radicals are removed in Reaction 16 and e2
aqare
converted toH atoms via reaction with H 3O1(Reaction 9.8, Table 9.1 ), and thus their
radiation chemical yield amounts to 0.34 μmol/J.

Tilquin, 2006 ), and k22253.33103s21(Gall and Dorfman, 1969 ).
Radical reactions involving primary transients from water radiolysis can be summa-
rized as follows: (1) the hydroxyl radical (OH) undergoes the following types of reactions:
electron transfer (ET), hydrogen atom abstraction, addition to C QC, CQN, and SQO
bonds, addition to aromatic rings, and addition to electron-rich functional groups. These
reactions reflect its electrophilic character and strong oxidizing properties ( De
Vleeschouver et al., 2007 ), (2) the hydrated electron (e2
aq) undergoes the following types of
reactions: reduction, dissociative electron attachment, addition to functional groups of
high electron affinity, addition to aromatic rings containing electron-withdrawing substitu-
ents, and addition to conjugated double bonds ( Bobrowski, 2012 ). The hydrated electron
acts as a nucleophile in its reactions with organic molecules, (3) the hydrogen atom (H)
undergoes the following types of reactions: ET, hydrogen atom abstraction, addition to
CQC bonds, addition to aromatic rings, addition to electron-rich functional groups, and
homolytic substitution ( Richter, 1998; Bobrowski, 2012 ). These reactions reflect its weak
nucleophilic ( De Vleeschouver et al., 2007 ), and strong reducing properties, however,
lower than e2
aq. Interestingly, radical reactions ofH atoms resemble those ofOH radicals.
Rate constants for thousands of reactions of these transients with molecules, ions, and
radicals derived from inorganic and organic compounds have been compiled ( Buxton et al.,
1988; Hart et al., 1964; Neta et al., 1988; Haag and Yao, 1992 ). From the point of view of
practical application of this technology for treatment of waters and wastewaters, the pres-
ence of numerous scavengers of radicals (which commonly occur in those media) is always
a very essential element need to be taken into account during the irradiation process optimi-
zation. As it is showed by example rate-constants in Table 9.2 , the radical reactions with
many of them occur with a similar rate compared to reactions of target environmental
pollutants.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT9.2 SOURCES OF RADIATION—TECHNOLOGICAL INSTALLATIONS
The type of the ionization radiation is the key factor that determines the mechanism of
the energy deposition in the irradiated matter. In general, beam of photons (X, γ), high
energy electrons (electron accelerator beam, β2), heavy, charged particles and neutrons are
considered in the radiation chemistry. Application of the first two types of the ionization
irradiation in the water treatment industry is justified by economic, safety, and technologi-
cal issues so the following description will be focused on them.
Interaction of photon radiation (X, γ), often called electromagnetic radiation with matter
is described by photoelectric, Compton scattering, and electron-positron pair formation
phenomena. In the photoelectric phenomenon an incident photon is absorbed by an elec-
tron bounded to atom (molecule). As a consequence, an electron is ejected leaving behind
an ionized atom (molecule). The ejected electron carries out the excess energy equal to
incident photon energy reduced by ionization potential. Photoelectric phenomenon pre-
vails for relatively low photon energies (i.e., below 100 keV in water) ( Spinks and Woods,
1990). Strongly bounded electrons (on the lowest atomic/molecular orbitals) are the most
vulnerable to this effect. On the other hand, Compton scattering involves free or relatively
weakly bounded electrons (valence electrons). As a result of the interaction, an incident
photon vanishes and its energy is distributed between a recoiled electron and a scattered
new photon that carries lower energy than the incoming one. Trajectory and energy distri-
bution between electrons and photons in the system follows the momentum and energy
conservation law. This effect prevails for moderate photon energies (i.e., from 100 keV to
10 MeV in water) ( Spinks and Woods, 1990 ). This is the most common effect in the indus-
trial radiation treatment (sterilization, degradation) of the condensed phase. Incident
photons with energy above 1.02 MeV (2m 0c2, twice of the electron invariant mass) can be
converted to an electron /C0positron pair. Subsequently the positron annihilates with one
of the electron on atomic (molecular) orbital leading to an ionized-electron deficient spe-
cies. The pair formation occurs only in a close proximity of the nucleus (or charged parti-
cle). This is a major effect for high energy photons.
There is no difference in the mechanism of X and γionization radiation interaction with
matter. Various symbols are used rather for distinguishing origin of both the radiation
types. X-rays are produced in vacuum tubes as a result of X-ray fluorescence (discrete spec-
trum) or Bremsstrahlung radiation (continuous spectrum) generated by a collision of high
energy electrons with a metal target. Industrial X-ray sources have relatively low photon
energies from 100 eV to hundreds of keV and low dose rates up to about 10 Gy/h ( Getoff,
2002). Thus, their potential water treatment application is very limited. On the other hand
γ-radiation is produced by radioactive, unstable nuclei of various isotopes. The cobalt
source containing60Co isotope (half-life 1925.20 60.25 day ( Unterweger, 2002 ), 1.17 and
1.33 MeV photons ( Getoff, 1996 )) is the most popular one. Very often mentioned in litera-
ture, the caesium source containing137Cs isotope is quite reactive, and hence difficult to
handle. Its salts are soluble in water, which complicates their safe handling. Moreover,
photons produced by137Cs have lower energies (0.66 MeV) ( Getoff, 1996 ) than those pro-
duced by60Co (vide supra). It is characteristic for this kind of radiation that material atten-
uation coefficient is used instead of maximum range. The photon flux ( I) passing the263 9.2 SOURCES OF RADIATION—TECHNOLOGICAL INSTALLATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTelement with thickness ( x) can be expressed as I5I0exp(2μx)(Spinks and Woods, 1990 ),
where I0is the initial photon flux and μthe total linear attenuation coefficient very often
replaced by mass attenuation coefficient ( μm5μ/ρ; the ration of the linear attenuation coef-
ficient and the mass density of material). Selected values of μmin water for 0.01, 1, and
10 MeV photons are equal to 5.329, 0.07072, and 0.02219 cm2/g (Hubbell and Seltzer, 2004 ),
respectively. Typically, industrial dose rates of γ-irradiation do not exceed several MGy/h
(Getoff, 2002 ).
Energy transfer mechanism for all charged particles is similar. It involves electromag-
netic interaction between a moving incident particle and a nuclei with associated atomic
orbital electrons of the irradiated system. For the sake of simplicity these interactions are
very often called elastic and inelastic collisions. In inelastic collision, the particle loses its
energy for excitation and/or ionization of the atoms (molecules) of the medium. Loss of
energy for the particle traveling along a track is described by the Bethe and Heitler equa-
tion ( Spinks and Woods, 1990 ). There are some differences in final effects of the irradiation
upon heavy charged particles and electrons. They are caused by a significant difference in
their masses. In general, (1) an incident electron very often changes direction and its
energy; (2) its resulting range is many times shorter than actually traveled path; (3) its rela-
tively low kinetic energy causes distinct relativistic effect resulting in Bremsstrahlung and
Cerenkov radiation.
It is worthy to mention that radiation chemistry upon β2, accelerated electron or
γ-irradiation is essentially the same. This is due to the fact that the major chemical changes
inγ-irradiated systems are caused by high energy electrons generated as a result of
photon /C0matter interactions. On the other hand, some effects may be observed due to the
difference in dose rates of radiation sources. Commercially available pulsed accelerators
may work with several MGy/s dose rates. They are much higher than those that can be
achieved by γorβ2radiation from isotopes. High concentration of intermediates is
expected for a system irradiated with a high dose rate. Thus, some reaction channels
unavailable at low concentration of intermediates may open.
The ability of electrons to penetrate an irradiated medium is an important factor for
industrial applications. The maximum range of electrons significantly decreases with their
kinetic energy ( Fig. 9.2A ) as a consequence of increased interaction with matter. At very
high, relativistic electron energies efficiency of interaction slightly increases again. In this
case, it results in Bremsstrahlung and Cerenkov radiation. Stopping power (1/ ρ3dE/dx)
described by kinetic energy loss ( dE) in the medium with mass density ( ρ) per unit path
length of particle ( dx) clearly depicts this effect ( Table 9.3 ).
There is no doubt that γ-photons are capable of deeper penetration in the medium,
however, the penetration range of accelerated electrons is sufficient for many applications.
Though, an increasing of electron energy improves their maximum range and thus the
rate of water systems processing, there is a particular limitation that does not allow to
increase their energy above the certain value. In general, industry uses up to 14 MeV EB
since electrons with higher energies may activate irradiated material or accelerator con-
struction elements. In most cases, electron accelerators are the best option in water treat-
ment application. They provide desired dose rates, electron energies, and a high standard
of safety (radiation can be shut down instantly).264 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES

gamma-rays, and accelerators as a source of high energy electrons. As it can be convinc-
ingly concluded from a vast number of original research papers, and also from numerous
review papers on the subject listed in Table 9.4 , the gamma-ray sources are used mostly

With the use of typical, commercial60Co gamma sources the irradiation is carried out in
a discrete mode (sample by sample), by placing the container with liquid samples inside the
source, after appropriate chemical sample processing (changing pH, deaeration, additions of
required reagents), if needed. In early works in the field, for this purpose also, flow systems
have been assembled which are schematically shown in Fig. 9.3A and B (Hashimoto and
Kawakami, 1979; Singh et al., 1985; Singh and Kremers, 2002 ). The cobalt sources were even
installed in the field, directly at the groundwater intake in order to decompose harmful
compounds, e.g., in case of elevated level of cyanide ( Pastuszek et al., 1993 ). In case of much
seldom used gamma radiation from a137Cs sources, commercial irradiators are used with a
fixed central rod source, also in discrete mode ( Song et al., 2008a,b ). There were also some
attempts to employ spent reactor fuel, which can be a source of gamma-rays with an aver-
age energy of 700 keV. A 100 kGy dose can be obtained in less than 13 h with use of a sam-
ple capsule ( Fig. 9.3C ), which was inserted into the spent fuel pool ( Mincher et al., 1991 ).
Very rarely for discussed environmental purposes, X-ray irradiation was applied with
the use of conventional X-ray sources, mostly due to a much smaller dose rate than pro-
vided by isotope gamma sources or accelerators. For instance, in attempt to decompose
the pesticide diazinon, a 50% decomposition was reported at the dose about 160 Gy, with
a dose-rate about 50 mGy/s ( Trebse and Aron, 2003 ).
For technological applications, including the treatment of waters and wastewaters, with
no doubts, beams of accelerated high energy electrons from different types of accelerators
are most widely used. Their most important advantage is a much larger dose rate and the
operation in on/off instant mode, however, with an essential drawback—limited penetra-
tion depth of irradiated solutions. In order to overcome most efficiently that drawback,
different constructions of the irradiation flow installations were designed for EB irradia-
tion of a stream of liquid. The cascade-type irradiator, where a thin layer of falling stream
was formed, was employed in a widely described Electron Beam Research Facility in
Wastewater Treatment Plant in Miami ( Mak et al., 1997; Cooper et al., 1993; Lin et al.,
1995; Kurucz et al., 1995a,b ). It is schematically shown together with the floor plan of
whole installation in Fig. 9.4 .
With application of a 1.5 MeV accelerator operating at 50 mA (75 kW), the waste stream
receives an average dose of about 6.5 kGy, and with employed flow-rate the wastewater
spends about 0.1 s in front of the beam. This gives a dose-rate at least 65 kGy/s ( Kurucz
et al., 1995b ). Examples of other efficient constructions are shown in Fig. 9.5 , and they
include the up-flow stream irradiator developed in Brazil ( Duarte et al., 2002 ), and the
nozzle type injector developed in South Korea for purification of textile dyeing ( Pikaev
et al., 2001 ). A very efficient design involves irradiation of wastewater in aerosol form,
with additional merge with gaseous ozone, which in optimized conditions may enhance
production ofOH radicals ( Pikaev et al., 1997a,b,c ). In aerosol phase, the range of electron
penetration increased by 20 /C050 times, compared with liquid phase ( Podzorova et al.,
1998). Therefore, even for highly polluted wastewater, the doses required for purification
are relatively low (4 /C05 kGy). Degradation of pollutants takes place not only by reactions
with products of water radiolysis, but also with the primary products of radiolysis of gas
phase (oxygen atoms) and ozone ( Han et al., 2016 ).267 9.2 SOURCES OF RADIATION—TECHNOLOGICAL INSTALLATIONS

Since 1990-ties there are designed and produced mobile EB systems in the United States
(Nickelsen et al., 1998 )(Fig. 9.6 ), and in South Korea ( Kim et al., 2012 ), which can be trans-
ported to a particular heavy-polluted locations for the in situ remediation. The first one
mentioned above contains an electron accelerator with 500 keV transformer, and at full
power the system is rated at 20 kW. The maximum flow rate can be 150 L/min, and the
doses up to 20 kGy can be obtained in a single pass. It was reported that this installation
was employed in the field treatment of contaminated groundwater, and also in industrial
and refining process of wastewaters over a 2-year period.
9.3 DISINFECTION OF WASTEWATERS
The possibility of efficient hygienization of waters, wastewaters, and sewage sludges is a
significant attribute of radiation technologies, which was practically a priority objective in
earliest environmental applications, connected, e.g., with construction of the first large-scale
installations in early 1970s ( Cleland et al., 1984; Trump et al., 1984 ). Also in this case, how-
ever, first works were conducted already in 1950s, and investigations on destruction of
microorganisms in water, sewage, and sewage sludge by gamma-irradiation for60Co source
in Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States. The 93% removal of bacteria was
obtained for doses from 0.5 to 10 kGy for half-diluted wastewater from the primary setting
tank of the local laboratories ( Lowe Jr. et al., 1956 ). There were also some attempts reported
on application of X-ray irradiation for the inactivation of bacteriophage ( Cotton and
Lockingen, 1963 ). Predominated routine methods used in wastewater treatment technology,
(first of all chlorination) exhibit numerous side effects like producing trace amounts of toxic
chlorinated products, odor of treated media, and also its efficiency was limited. Therefore,
among the earliest applications of radiation technology one can find several reports on their
efficiency in removal of bacterial pathogens, coliforms and salmonellae from waters and
wastewaters of various origins. Some selected applications are listed in Table 9.5 .
Practically, in all reported applications the use of gamma and EB treatment results in
the decrease of microorganisms count about 3 orders of magnitude at their initial level
103/C0107species/100 mL. In comparison study on the use of gamma and EB in large-scale
installation, it was shown for coliform bacteria, that for the same absorbed dose 5 kGy the
gamma irradiation reduces the microorganism population by 4 orders of magnitude, while
with EB—3 orders of magnitude, only ( Farooq et al., 1993 ). The application of those two
kinds of treatment for disinfection of municipal raw sewage and secondary effluent from a
pure oxygen extended aeration biological treatment system and chlorination, is shown
also in Fig. 9.7A and B . In case of the EB irradiation, doses below 1 kGy (100 krad) do not
affect the coliform population, and in both cases a pronounced dose-rate effect shows evi-
dently a larger yield of gamma irradiation. The comparison of both types of irradiation
was carried out also for inactivation of nine different bacteriophages and Escherichia coli271 9.3 DISINFECTION OF WASTEWATERS

(1998a,b)suspended in tap water ( Gehringer et al., 2003 ). It was shown, that mostlyOH radicals
are responsible for the virus inactivation under employed conditions. In the case of E. coli ,
the use of gamma-rays was found to be more efficient. However, the lack of a dose-rate
effect was observed for two bacteriophage species MS2 and B40-8. Different radiation
resistance was found for species PH1 X 174, and similarly to E. coli , inactivation by
gamma-rays was more efficient.
The effects of gamma-inactivation were also examined in terms of induced toxicity of
wastewater effluents, where postdisinfection samples were evaluated using Ceriodaphnia
dubia chronic toxicity test ( Thompson and Blatchley, 1999 ). For this purpose samples from
six treatment facilities were exposed to gamma-rays and also to chlorination, and then sur-
vival of C. dubia was monitored for 7 days. Generally, it was found that gamma-irradiation
either had no effect on toxicity, or in a half of examined samples actually improved a sur-
vival of monitored species ( Fig. 9.7C ). The gamma-irradiation of effluents from the

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTwastewater treatment facility using a60Co-source (with a dose-rate 1.4 Gy/s) was com-
pared also with UV disinfection in terms of E. coli inactivation ( Taghipour, 2004 ). A similar
efficiency for both processes was found, but in terms of the energy required and the
energy cost, the cost of ionizing radiation inactivation was evaluated as a considerably
higher than that for UV treatment. The estimated treatment costs for E. coli inactivation in
primary wastewater using UV, EB, and gamma-radiation treatment were evaluated as 0.4,
1.25, and 25 US cents per m3, respectively. It has to be admitted, however, that this estima-
tion concerns disinfection, only, without chemical purification.
9.4 RADIOLYTIC DECOMPOSITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS
The basis for the application of radiation techniques for purification of waters and was-
tewaters, or degradation of pollutants to chemical forms (which are more susceptible to
removal with other methods, e.g., biodegradation), is kinetics of their reactions with radi-
cals produced by water radiolysis, or those formed in other radiation processes conducted
for that purpose. The rate-constants for reactions withOH radicals, hydrated electrons,
and hydrogen atoms were known for thousands of organic and inorganic compounds and
ions from fundamental radiation chemistry studies, already at the end of 1980s ( Buxton
et al., 1988 )(Hart et al., 1964; Neta et al., 1988; Haag and Yao, 1992 ). Those vast collected
data, only to a certain degree, can be utilized as supporting or indicating information for
authentic technological applications. Decomposition in natural media requires knowledge
of numerous physico-chemical factors’ parameters on conducting those radiation processes
which have to be taken substantially into account. These parameters comprise: a dose-rate
of the employed source of ionizing radiation, pH of irradiated solution, content of oxygen
and different matrix components in natural media, and identification of interradical reac-
tions and transformations of numerous transient products.
Quite a number of attempts were already made towards simulation (kinetic modeling) of
such processes based on the known kinetic data. They usually require several tens of reac-
tion rate-constants for radical reactions, ionic equilibria, and redox reactions, which have to
be taken into consideration ( Cooper et al., 2001; Mak et al., 1997; Kawakami et al., 1978;
Taghipour and Evans, 1997; Kurucz et al., 2002; Bojanowska-Czajka et al., 2007 ). Since the
list of chemical compounds considered as anthropogenic pollutants increases with the pass-
ing of time, numerous research groups investigate the radiolytic decomposition of selected
environmental pollutants. In numerous cases it is also associated with determination of rate-
constants for radical reactions. The main objective is optimization of radiation conditions,
and evaluation of the role of radical scavengers commonly occurring in natural waters. As
especially valuable those studies should be considered, where effects of natural matrices of
waters and wastes are involved. These studies are parallel to studies on efficiency of treat-
ment of particular wastewaters or waters of a different origin, which is monitored with gen-
eral methods of quality control such as TOC (total organic carbon), COD (chemical oxygen
demand), BOD (biological oxygen demand), AOX (adsorbable organohalogenates), etc.
A quite long list of substances, for which the radiolytic decomposition was evaluated
as for environmental pollutants, with the use of different radiation sources, is presented
inTable 9.6 . Although, this list does not pretend to be a complete presentation of the274 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES

EB, Electron beam; PCB, Polychlorinated biphenyl; Std. solutions, Pure aqueous solutions.state-of-the-art in this field, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it provides probably
about 60% /C070% of the published papers in international journals. One can easily see that
those studies are predominated by the use of gamma-irradiation from60Co sources. The
EB treatment, and sporadically only gamma-rays from137Cs sources, or from a spent
nuclear reactor fuel, and also in single applications—X-rays are less employed. Those stud-
ies, in fact almost fundamental, are most commonly carried out either in pure aqueous
solutions or in mixed or organic solvents as in the case of polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs). Several groups of organic pollutants were distinguished, which are especially
intensively examined, and they include dyes, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenolic com-
pounds, and PCBs. Since 1990s, a more intense interest is focused also on pesticides, which
constitute a significant environmental problem. Last but not least, a large increase in inter-
est about pharmaceutical residues was observed in the last decade. This is due to a dra-
matic increase of use of pharmaceuticals, creating then new environmental problems.
The appropriate choice of the concentration level of the examined pollutant for its radio-
lytic decomposition, and determination of the yield of decomposition (not only in pure stan-
dard solutions, but also in real media) is particularly significant for the real utility usefulness
of those investigations. A quite substantial part of those studies were carried out at relatively
high concentration levels (sub-mM or mg/L), which are usually much higher, than practically
occurring in natural waters. However, this approach simplifies the analytical monitoring of
processes taking place during the irradiation. On the other hand, in wastewaters of a different
origin this can be quite similar level. Evaluation of the yield of decomposition, even in a very
simplified form—by providing the magnitude of absorbed dose need for decomposition—can
be a valuable information, and hence those values are shown in Table 9.6 .
The optimization of chemical conditions for the most efficient radiolytic decomposition
of a given pollutant should involve several important parameters. They should comprise:
(1) an initial concentration of decomposed compound, (2) a pH of irradiated solution as it
affects the radiation chemical yield of radicals produced in water radiolysis ( Fig. 9.1 ), (3)
the level of dissolved oxygen, and/or (4) the presence of radical scavengers. The results of
studies on gamma-decomposition of industrial pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) ( Guo et al.,
2012a,b ) are an excellent example showing the influence of those factors on the yield of its
decomposition. Fig. 9.8 shows the effect of initial concentration, pH and oxygen content in
function of the absorbed dose on the yield of BPA decomposition. In another example
selected from published reports, one can find the extent of the decrease of yield of gamma
decomposition of X-ray contrast media diatrizoate, observed in several different natural
matrices ( Tables 9.6 and 9.7 )(Han et al., 2002 ).
The vast literature on radiolysis of different compounds under various conditions con-
tains many other examples of such matrix effects. They concern usually a decrease of the
yield of decomposition of the target pollutant. In another example, the gamma-radiolysis of
TCE and PCE was examined in the presence of carbonate ions (CO 322)(Yoon et al., 2002 ).
The complete decomposition of TCE at 10 mg/L level requires the 300 Gy dose, in which
the rate-constants for TCE reactions withOH and hydrated electrons are 1.7 3109and
1.331010M21s21, respectively. In the presence of 1 mM carbonate, only 60% removal of
TCE was observed for 500 Gy absorbed dose. Interestingly, upon addition of 10 mM carbon-
ate decomposition of TCE was stopped. This observation was rationalized in terms of scav-
enging ofOH by CO 322(the rate constant for reaction CO 3221OH is 3.9 3108M21s21).288 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES

and Mn(II), contrary to the presence of Co(II) and Ni(II), and especially Fe(III) which
enhanced the yield of PCE decomposition ( Chung et al., 2002 ). Gamma-radiolysis of pesti-
cide atrazine is another example of enhancement of decomposition by the components of
matrices, in which the presence of humic substances and bicarbonate enhanced the yield of
decomposition ( Basfar et al., 2009 ). This effect was attributed to the scavenging ofOH radi-
cals, in case when the target compound reacts faster with hydrated electrons than withOH.
The fact that experimental conditions employed for complete decomposition of target
compounds are practically never sufficient for a complete mineralization (controlled, e.g., by
TOC measurements) is a fundamental rule in the majority of those processes. For instance,
decomposition of ibuprofen (cited above) with 90% yield by applying 1 kGy dose, in all of
examined natural matrices, no change of TOC values was observed ( Gala et al., 2013 ).
The kinetics of radiolytically induced processes are determined by the order and the
rate-constants for particular radical reactions, whereas the yield of the irradiation process
is commonly expressed by its G-value , the value of dose constant (d) , and the dose magnitude
required, e.g., for 50% or 90% decomposition of the solute ( Mincher and Curry, 2000 ). The
G-value represents a measure of radiation chemical yield, i.e., the number of molecules of
reactant consumed, or product formed, per 100 eV of energy absorbed (or in SI units—
number of micromoles per one Joule of absorbed energy), and can be calculated for a
given absorbed dose using the following equation ( Kurucz et al., 1991a,b ):
G5½ðC0/C0CDÞNA/C138=DK f
where C0is the initial concentration of the analyte in the irradiated solution [ M],CDis the
concentration of the analyte [ M] after absorbing dose ( D), expressed in Grays [Gy], N Ais
the Avogadro number (6.02 31023molecules/mol), and Kfis a conversion factor for
G-value units -from 100 eV/L to Gy ( 56.2431017). Although G-values are commonly
reported in applied radiolysis, they cannot be considered very useful for predicting the
dose required in practice to decompose a compound, since the dose usually depends on
its solute concentration, and initial G-values are often calculated for the smallest applied
dose at the beginning of the irradiation, i.e., from a linear kinetics approximation that is
not fully representative of the actual reaction. The dose constant ( d) determines the decom-
position rate as a function of the absorbed radiation dose, and is calculated as the slope of
the plot of ln( CD/C0) against the absorbed dose ( D) expressed in (Gy). It is usually consid-
ered as a more reliable measure than G-value, because it uses all the data from the irradia-
tion procedure. For instance, the dvalues can be used to determine the magnitude of the
absorbed dose required for 90% decomposition ( D0.90) of a compound, as follows:
D0.905(ln 10)/ d(Kurucz et al., 1991a,b ). Since the values of Gand/or dare not commonly
reported in the papers on radiolytic processes, for the sake of comparison, the values of
absorbed doses for decomposition of the target pollutant with a given yield (%) are listed
inTable 9.6 , together with experimental conditions indicated by authors as optimal.
Another approach in description relating removal and dose are first-order or second-
order models, where the changes of pollutant concentration with respect to change in dose
are proportional to initial concentration or proportional to the square of initial concentration
(Kurucz et al., 2002 ). Although the fitting of both models to experimental data are not very290 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTdifferent, data from both gamma and EB irradiation seem to suggest that removal might be
second order with respect to dose for contaminant concentrations under 100 μg/L.
It is also shown in Table 9.6 that for the majority of cited cases the absorbed doses
needed to 34% /C0100% decomposition are in the range from fraction to several kGy. The
results presented for processes carried out in organic solvents, for instance decomposition
of pesticide DDT, and especially PCBs, are exceptions. Studies demonstrating a compari-
son of radiation processes carried out with gamma and EB irradiation are especially valu-
able. As it was mentioned above, a key difference between them is a large disparity of
dose-rates, which in practice means a very different duration of the process, even of sev-
eral orders of magnitude. The evident effect of the dose rate only for gamma-irradiation
was shown already in very early work on radiolytic dechlorination of DDT in 2-propanol
(Sherman et al., 1971 ). The determined Gvalues (molecules per 100 eV) varied from 25 to 81
for DDT dechloriantion. A large dose-rate difference between gamma and EB irradiation
may affect efficiency decomposition of different compounds. However, for instance in
decomposition of pharmaceutical metoprolol, only slightly more efficient decomposition
was observed in EB process, where for 80% decomposition yield about 16 kGy dose was
needed (for relatively large concentration 1 g/L), while 50% larger—in case of gamma-
irradiation ( Slegers and Tilquin, 2006 )(Fig. 9.9B ).
A complete removal with both types of radiation required about a 50 kGy dose. A similar
observation was reported for calculated dose values for TCE decomposition at initial level of

same plot shows also that the complete decomposition with gamma irradiation with the dose-
rate 0.15 Gy/s takes almost 30 min, while with use of EB with the dose-rate 2.5 kGy/s /C00.1 s.
The calculated concentrations ofOH radicals and hydrated electrons produced by
gamma and EB irradiation were significantly different for both kinds of irradiations

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT(Fig. 9.10A , Plots b and c). A much smaller yield of the EB process in comparison to gamma-
irradiation was reported, for instance, for decomposition of perchloroethylene (PCE) in tap
water matrix at initial concentration 100 μg/L (in the absence of ozone) ( Gehringer and
Eschweiler, 2002 )(Fig. 9.10B ). This can be interpreted by the increase of probability of radical
recombinations and interradical reactions at large dose-rates. This effect can be significantly
damped in the presence of ozone, with simultaneous enhancement of the yield of PCE decom-
position as shown in Fig. 9.10B . On the other hand, one can find reports in which no effect of
the dose-rate was observed in a certain range, as it was shown for gamma-irradiation of dye
Acid Base 62 in dyeing wastewater ( Perkowski et al., 2003 ).
The yield of the radiolytic decomposition may be also improved by conducting it at ele-
vated pressures. This was demonstrated, for instance, for gamma-radiolysis of phenol and
benzophenone in aqueous solutions up to supercritical conditions ( Miyazaki et al., 2006 )
(Fig. 9.11 ). This effect was rationalized in terms of change of the G-value of water
decomposition.
A simultaneous monitoring of toxicity of irradiated solutions is another important
aspect contributing to the efficiency of radiolytic decomposition studies of pollutants
aimed at optimization of the process conditions. This approach provides some additional
information, essential from the environmental point of view, as well as health care of
humans in case of purification of waters and wastewaters for municipal use. Its impor-
tance is based on the fact, that in many laboratory and industrial AOPs, or even occurring
in the environmental processes, the 100% decomposition of a given pollutant, may be a
source of formation of new products of increased toxicity ( Boxall et al., 2004 ). For instance,
in case of radiolytic decomposition of steroid hormones’ residues, it was found that in
decomposition of 17 β-estradiol by gamma-irradiation, the primary products of decompo-
sition also have estrogen activity, and these products should be further decomposed by
addition irradiations ( Kimura et al., 2004 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIn recent years, an increasing number of research groups working on radiation processes
include toxicity monitoring to their investigations. The most commonly employed toxicity
test Microtox is based on the measurement of decay of fluorescence of bacteria Vibrio fisheri
as a result of an interaction with a given pollutant. Its application to the process of gamma-
radiolysis of pharmaceutical ibuprofen showed, that at practically complete decomposition
of a target compound, the toxicity of irradiated solution reaches the maximum value
(Fig. 9.12A )(Illes et al., 2013 ). Decline of toxicity is observed with the application of the

nol and certain chlorophenols ( Fig. 9.12B )(Shim et al., 2009 ). The same trends in toxicity
changes in a function of the absorbed dose were reported not only for Microtox but also for
two other toxicity tests in gamma-irradiation of diclofenac, the other common pharmaceuti-
cal (Fig. 9.12C ). Those other tests included Spirotox, based on a very large ciliated protozo-
maSympetrum ambiguum , and Thamnotox kit, based on using larvae of the freshwater
anostracan crustacean T. platyurus (Bojanowska-Czajka et al., 2015 ).
9.5 CHEMICAL ENHANCEMENT OF RADIOLYTIC PROCESSES
The concentration of the primary reactive products derived from water radiolysis,
which can potentially react with the solutes present in an irradiated solution, depends on
several experimental parameters. Primarily, it is a linear function of the absorbed dose of
irradiation and the G-value for particular formed species (equal to the slope of the straight
line) which is directly illustrated by plots in Fig. 9.13 . The predominance of particular pro-
duced reactive species, with a simultaneous enhancement of its concentration, e.g.,OH
radicals, can be achieved by irradiation in the presence of the appropriate scavenger (e.g.,
N2O), which, however is not applicable for technological installations. As it was already
shown, the presence or absence of oxygen in irradiated solutions plays an important
role /C0via occurrence of various other radical reactions and protonation equilibria.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe methods that are very widely employed for increasing the yield of formation of
OH radicals are conducting the irradiation in the presence of ozone, which was also car-
ried out in pilot installations shown in Figs. 9.5C and 9.6 . Ozone reacts with products of
water radiolysis as follows ( Sehested et al., 1983 ):

This way of enhancement of the yield of radiolytic decomposition was employed, e.g.,
for dyes ( Perkowski and Kos, 2003 ), halogenated hydrocarbons ( Gehringer and
Matschiner, 1998; Gehringer and Eschweiler, 2002; Jung et al., 2002a,b; Gehringer et al.,
1992), different types of pesticides ( Leitner et al., 1999; Gehringer and Eschweiler, 1996;
Drzewicz et al., 2004; Abdel Aal et al., 2001; Bojanowska-Czajka et al., 2012 ), pharmaceuti-
cals ( Torun et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2012a,b ), and phenolic compounds ( Sakumoto and
Miyata, 1984; Kubesch et al., 2005; He et al., 2002; Kubesh et al., 2003 ) as it is illustrated by
data in Table 9.6 . For instance, in the case of decomposition of perchloroethylene in tap
water matrix by EB at its initial concentration 100 μg/L, in irradiation leading to 95%
decomposition, the addition of 5 g/L ozone results in a decrease of the required dose from
600 to 100 Gy ( Duarte et al., 2002 )(Fig. 9.10B ). Moreover, the same figure shows that a
smaller effect of the dose rate was observed between EB and gamma irradiation carried
out with simultaneous ozonation. In the earlier work, a strong effect of the addition of
ozone was observed for decomposition of TCE and PCE in pure aqueous solutions, while
no effect of the addition of ozone was found for the EB decomposition of 1,1,1-trichlor-
oethane ( Gehringer and Matschiner, 1998 )(Fig. 9.14A ). The same effect of ozone addition
was shown by the same authors for decomposition of TCE in tap water matrix, as well as
a dose rate effect between gamma and EB irradiation ( Gehringer et al., 1992 )(Fig. 9.14B ).
Interestingly, gamma-irradiation of hexachlorobiphenyl in isooctane performed in the
presence of ozone resulted in a drop of efficiency, compared to that in the absence of
ozone ( Mincher et al., 1996 ). This was interpreted by scavenging of hydrated electrons by
ozone, asOH radical produced in such a reaction do not react with PCBs.
In the work mentioned above ( Gehringer and Matschiner, 1998 ), the effect of the addi-
tion of persulfate anions (S 2O22
8) on the gamma-induced decomposition of 1,4-dioxane and
benzene in tap water matrix was also examined. According to authors, hydrated electrons
(e2
aq) formed during irradiation react with S 2O22
8anions forming sulfate radical anions
(SO/C152

added persulfate ( &)(With permission, adapted from Gehringer, P., H. Matschiner, 1998. Wat. Sci. Tech. 37, 195 /C0201).It was shown that such processes do not affect decomposition of 1,4-dioxane
(Fig. 9.14C ), but affect decomposition of benzene ( Fig. 9.14D ).
Among the other reagents examined for enhancement of radiolytic decomposition of
organic pollutants, a large attention was focused on hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), which is a
common, inexpensive and easy to handle reagent. The addition of H 2O2is also a source of
an additional amount ofOH radicals formed according to the following reactions
(Christensen et al., 1994 ):
e2
aq1H2O2-/C15OH1OH2k51:53107M21s21(9.31)
H/C151H2O2-/C15OH1H2Ok52:431010M21s21(9.32)
Since H 2O2reacts, also withOH radicals:
/C15OH1H2O2-H2O1HO/C15
2k53:131010M21s21(9.33)
2H O/C15
2-H2O21O2 (9.34)
therefore in certain conditions, the addition of H 2O2can cause an opposite effect, namely
the scavenging ofOH radicals. The literature data presented in Table 9.6 show numerous
applications of H 2O2to enhance the yield of radiolytic process for decomposition of dyes
(Solpan and Guven, 2002; Wang et al., 2006 ), halogenated hydrocarbons ( Wu et al., 2002 ),
different types of pesticides ( Xu et al., 2011; Solpan and Torun, 2012; Drzewicz et al., 2005;
Bojanowska-Czajka et al., 2006 ), pharmaceuticals ( Zheng et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2012a,b;
Liu and Wang, 2013 ), phenolic compounds ( Basfar et al., 2017; Kubesh et al., 2003 ), and
also caffeine ( Torun et al., 2014 ) or ochratoxin ( Schmelling et al., 1998a,b,c ).
In order to illustrate more closely irradiation in the presence of H 2O2some selected
examples are presented. For instance, gamma-induced decomposition of chloroform pres-
ent at relatively high initial concentration in aqueous solutions (8 g/L) (with 60 kGy
absorbed dose) leads only to B60% decomposition. On the other hand, in the presence of
about 60 mM H 2O2, the 30 kGy absorbed dose is required for 100% decomposition. For
gamma-irradiation of aqueous solutions containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) at concentra-
tions ranging from 100 to 300 mg/L with different dose rates (17.2 /C055.7 G/min), addition
of 2 /C03m MH 2O2increased the yield of decomposition ( Zhang and Yu, 2004 ). Depending
on the dose rate and the initial PVA concentration this enhancement was in the range of
20% /C030%, However, further increase of concentration of H 2O2resulted in the lower yield
of decomposition.
This way of improvement of radiolytically-induced decomposition processes was also
employed in real wastewater samples containing pesticide MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophe-
noxyacetic acid) where the presence of the equimolar amount of H 2O2reduced by half the
dose required for a complete pesticide decomposition ( Bojanowska-Czajka et al., 2006 ).
This is accompanied by an increase of the yield of main decomposition products.
Unfortunately, an unfavorable increase of the Microtox toxicity was observed, which was
interpreted by formation of products, which are more resistant to radiolysis, and more
toxic than the examined pollutant, and main products of decomposition.
The enhancement of radiolytic decomposition by simultaneous production of other
reactive radicals can be also utilized for the EB treatment of hazardous substances. This298 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTwas shown, for instance, for especially strong chemically and thermally resistant industrial
pollutant perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) ( Wang et al., 2016 ). During its decomposition by
EB at the initial level of 0.5 mg/L a delivery of the absorbed dose 10 kGy led to the yield
of defluorination in the range of 35% /C054%. The addition of 20 mg/L nitrate anions (NO2
3),
or alkalization corresponding to the addition of 100 mg/L CaCO 3, allowed to increase that
yield up to 93% /C095%. In the case of NO2
3, it was attributed by authors to the formation of
oxidizing radicals, as nitrate can scavenge hydrated electrons with the formation of nitrate
radical NO22/C15
3, i.e., able to reduce organic compounds. In the case of high alkalinity, the
increase of the yield of defluorination was explained by the formation and reactivity of
carbonate radical anion CO/C152

9.6 PURIFICATION OF WASTEWATERS OF DIFFERENT ORIGIN
Since pioneering investigations on the possibility of application of ionizing radiation
techniques for environmental protection and water management, the main target of those
studies were, first of all, sludges and wastewaters of a different origin, and to less extent
ground waters and surface waters ( Dunn, 1953; Touhill et al., 1969; Brusentseva et al.,
1978; Perkowski et al., 1984; Woodbridge et al., 1972; Trump et al., 1984; Craft and
Eichholz, 1971; Cappadona et al., 1975 ). A good review of the earliest works is given by
Gerrard (1971) . Also, in the case of first pilot installations or large-scale treatment plants in
various countries, the first works have already been devoted to a treatment of wastewaters
or contaminated surface or ground waters (e.g., Cleland et al., 1984 ;Pikaev and Shubin,
1984;Gehringer et al., 1984 ).
The main driving force of these research studies was well documented in those years,
inability of numerous existing and routinely used technologies, or other technologies being
currently investigated, to remove certain groups of hazardous anthropogenic pollutants.
So, even in the recent decade one can easily find reports on not complete removal of dif-
ferent groups of pollutants in wastewater treatment plants (WTP) ( Petrovic et al., 2003 ),
occurring of numerous pharmaceuticals residues and their metabolites in tap waters in
many countries ( Mompelat et al., 2009 ), estrogen hormones in effluents from WTPs ( Miege
et al., 2009 ), or pesticide residues in effluents from WTPs ( Ko¨ck-Schulmeyer et al., 2013 ).
Then, not earlier than a decade or two later, after first experiences with the treatment of
real wastewaters, it was realized that there was a need for more detailed, parallel studies
on optimizing experimental conditions. This required an understanding of radical pro-
cesses in order to elaborate the mechanisms of radiolytic decomposition of particular pol-
lutants, especially those most hazardous. About 20 original papers are cited in Table 9.6 ,
in which, the matrix effects of various wastewaters on efficiency of radiolytic decomposi-
tion of particular pollutants was examined. The examples of the radiation treatment of real
wastewaters reported in the literature are listed in Table 9.8 .
Authors of this review do not know the completeness of above information, although
they hope, that these examples are sufficiently illustrative to present a variety of experi-
ences collected already by different research groups all over the world during the last four
decades. The carried out studies involved typical laboratory investigations on gamma and
EB irradiation, and also pilot systems and several large-scale installations for industrial299 9.6 PURIFICATION OF WASTEWATERS OF DIFFERENT ORIGIN

waters, effluents from different sewage treatment plants (STPs), water works treatment
plants, and also selection wastewaters from different branches of industry. In the majority
of cases, the efficiency of treatment was monitored by measurements of general water
quality parameters, such as biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand
(COD), total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or adsorbable organo-
halogenes (AOX), or microbiologically to determine the degree of disinfection under given
conditions and applied doses. In part of the studies, individual control of selected, critical
pollutants was also individually performed, usually by chromatographic methods. The
example of a wide scope of such approach can be illustrated, e.g., for contaminated
groundwater simulants, treated by an EB in a large-scale facility in Miami, FL, USA [73]
(Kurucz et al., 1995b )(Table 9.9 ).
In the μg/L concentration level of pollutants to be decomposed, a very efficient decom-
position was observed at a dose 8 kGy, and both—compounds oxidized byOH radicals
and reduced by hydrated electrons were decomposed. This shows, that from this point of
view, it is a unique process compared to other AOPs. In the earlier work of the same
research group and with the same EB installation, it was shown that inactivation of the
total bacteria flora by five orders of magnitude was achieved at the dose 6.5 kGy ( Kurucz
et al., 1991a,b ). The effectiveness of decomposition of the same pollutants in wastewater,
expressed by the dose needed, was usually several percent lower. It was also observed
that solutions containing up to 10% solids (sludges) can be irradiated with the similar
yield of decomposition. Experiments were carried out with the flow rate up to 610 L/min.
A detailed monitoring of the concentration of several classes of ionic and nonionic sur-
factants has shown that they can be very efficiently decomposed in a continuous flow
installation by EB irradiation ( Petrovic et al., 2007 ). For their initial concentrations ranging
from 1.8 to 20 μg/L in the effluent of biological sewage treatment plant, the concentration
of all monitored species dropped down to ,0.1μg/L at a dose of 3 kGy and flow rate
3m3/h (Table 9.10 ). It was concluded that upgrading of the existing treatment plant by
the EB-irradiation as a tertiary treatment, may result in a significant reduction of the dis-
charge of surfactants into the environment.
The EB-treatment of waters and wastewaters may also result in removal of ionized or
complexed metal ions (see some examples in Table 9.6 ). As it was shown in simulated and
also real wastewater samples ( Ribeiro et al., 2004 ), at examined concentration level (rang-
ing from 0.5 to 21 g/L in real wastewater), this requires much larger doses, than in the
case of trace level of organic contaminants ( Table 9.11 ). The yield of the removal of metal
ions can be enhanced in the presence of theOH radical scavengers, such as formate ions
(Pikaev et al., 1997a,b,c; Unob et al., 2003 ) or ethanol ( Chaychian et al., 1998 ), since the
main mechanism of removal involves reduction by hydrated electrons and H atoms, and
further precipitation. Further examples comprise, removal of mercury at 1 mM level by
using the 3 kGy dose ( Chaychian et al., 1998 ) in the presence of ethanol, or from 5 mg/L
solution with 3 kGy dose ( Pikaev et al., 1997a,b,c ) in the presence of formate and Cr(VI),
and also removal of triethyl- and trimethyl-lead at the initial level 0.2 mM with 4 kGy
dose, with the yield of about 95% and 80%, respectively ( Unob et al., 2003 ).
Removal of many organic contaminants from waters and wastewaters can be signifi-
cantly more effective than by biodegradation. This was shown, e.g., in the case of several304 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcommonly used pharmaceuticals, comparing the yield of removal after 8 h lasting biodeg-
radation with gamma-irradiation using the 2 kGy dose ( Fig. 9.15A and B ).
In another example the comparison of ten different methods for purification of dye-
house wastewater, including gamma-irradiation with 25 kGy dose without and with oxy-
genations, and gamma irradiation with 5 kGy with simultaneous ozonation, was carried
out ( Perkowski and Kos, 2003 ). The gamma-irradiation is the least efficient, as 50% dyes,
only, were removed ( Fig. 9.16 ). In comparison to the most efficient ozonation, or UV irra-
diation in the presence of H 2O2or ozone, only 5 kGy irradiation with ozonation, gives a
similar degree of wastewater purification.
The effect of the matrix of the treated medium, assuming that the main reactions occur
withOH radicals, can be taken into account quantitatively in the way proposed by

assuming that in the real wastewater [OC] is 50 mg/L. The results of simulation are shown
inFig. 9.15C , where a good agreement with experimental data was obtained for [OC] 5
50 mg/L. They also show a predicted decrease of the yield of decomposition for much
larger wastewater loading at [OC] 5300 mg/L. It shows about a fivefold increase of the
required dose for a complete removal of pollutant.
The effect of real matrices by comparing river waters and wastewaters from hospitals
on the yield of decomposition of selected drugs and industrial pollutant bisphenol A
(BPA) is illustrated in Fig. 9.17 . For the initial concentration of carbamazepine 10 μg/L

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIn vast literature on this subject one can find numerous other methods of improvement
of the yield of radiolytic decomposition of pollutants. A very essential factor is a design of
irradiator and the mode of introducing the medium to be treated into the EB due to the
limited penetration of aqueous solutions by the beam of electrons (vide supra). The impor-
tance of this factor is presented in Fig. 9.18A for the EB irradiation of the municipal
wastewater.
It shows how a big difference in the yield of purification (expressed by the COD values)
is observed between two irradiated disperse systems: a solution with air bubbling, and an
aerosol of a wastewater ( Podzorova, 1995 ). One can estimate that 80% reduction of COD

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTrequires about the 13 kGy dose in the system employing bubbling, while about the 1 kGy
dose only, in the case of aerosol, based on the mean values for two different irradiated
samples. A significant improvement of the yield of wastewater purification can be also
gained by carrying out irradiation with a suspension of TiO 2(Jung et al., 2002a,b ). In the
data obtained for gamma-irradiation of a secondary effluent from a sewage treatment
plant with 10 kGy, about 12% reduction of COD is observed without TiO 2, and about 60%
reduction after adding TiO 2(Fig. 9.19A ). A similar but less pronounced effect was observed
by the monitoring of BOD values and changes of color intensity ( Fig. 9.19B and C ).
The observed improvement of efficiency of decomposition was interpreted by a joint effect
of a higher production ofOH radicals in the presence of TiO 2, partial adsorption of pollu-
tants onto TiO 2surface, and possible certain catalytic effects., It was also observed that the
decrease of DOC value was 26% in a continuous irradiation of effluent from WTP in the
presence of TiO 2suspension using 80 kGy dose. On the other hand, using a discontinuous
mode, where 3 min break was made after first 20 kGy dose, a significant improvement of
the yield up to 74% was observed ( Becerril et al., 2016 ). This was interpreted by a partial
enhancement of the yield ofOH production. In another coupling of photocatalysis with UV
irradiation in the presence of TiO 2(and also with humic acid) conducted prior to EB irradia-
tion with 50 kGy dose, for removal of metal ions from wastewater, a complete removal of
0.57 to 0.85 mM Sr, Co and Cu was observed ( Zaki and El-Gendy, 2014 ). The EB irradiation

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTwithout additional treatment at 125 kGy dose resulted in the removal yield from 41% to
87%.
The improvement of the yield of radiolytic decomposition can also be obtained by
hyphenating this process also with some other treatment methods like coagulation reported
in several works. For treatment of wastewater for textile dyeing with the initial COD values
ranging from 445 to 1450 mg/L it was shown that in the coagulation process with FeSO 4,
the COD was reduced by 44%, while after preliminary gamma-irradiation with the 50 Gy
dose, the COD was reduced by 63% ( Perkowski and Kos, 1988 ). The effects of a similar
approach were equally satisfactory for the EB treatment of industrial wastewater from the
molasses distillery ( Pikaev, 2002; Ponomarev et al., 1999 ). The irradiation after filtration,
only, and deaeration gave about 40% reduction of COD with 10 kGy dose, while the same
treatment with preliminary coagulation gave almost 100% COD reduction ( Fig. 9.18B ).
Certain enhancement of the radiolytic reduction of COD in effluent from WTP can be also

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTobtained when the gamma-irradiated solution contains a cationic copolymer, as a result of a
flocculation process ( Bao et al., 2009 ). The preliminary gamma-irradiation of a domestic sew-
age with 5.5 kGy dose can enhance reduction of dissolved carbon by precipitation with Ca
(OH) 2to 26.2%, while without irradiation that reduction was 17.1% ( Campbell, 1971 ).
The use of adsorption on activated carbon by additional gamma-irradiation of the
adsorptive column is another example of an approach used for the enhancement of waste-
water purification ( Brusentseva et al., 1986 ). For the simulated industrial wastewater con-
taining mg/L level of three pesticides and also some petroleum products, it was shown
that the irradiation of 2 m adsorptive column with 1.25 kGy dose resulted in almost twice
the increase of the column lifetime, which was interpreted by partly occurring destruction
of contaminants being adsorbed on a carbon surface.
Some support of gamma-radiolytic treatment of the wastewater from the sewage stream
of an industrial complex can be provided by electrochemical oxidation by the use of
electro-Fenton process in the presence of H 2O2added to solution with an iron anode
(Barrera-Diaz et al., 2003 ). While gamma-irradiation with 17.5 kGy dose provided 71%
reduction of initial COD value 3400 mg/L, with preliminary electrooxidation the COD
value was reduced to 80%.
A degree of mineralization of organic pollutants in waters and wastewaters by the use
of not too large radiation doses (several kGy) may be significantly increased when irradia-
tion is followed by biodegradation. Even partial radiolytic degradation of compounds
resistant to biodegradation creates better conditions for more efficient biodegradation.
This was also proved for wastewaters of a different origin. For instance, for a dyeing com-
plex wastewater in continuous EB treatment with a flow rate 1000 m3/day, it was shown
that 40% reduction of TOC by biodegradation requires about 19 h, while after irradiation
with 2 kGy dose, it has shortened to 10 h ( Han et al., 2002 ). In domestic wastewater about
20% enhancement of biodegradation yield expressed by COD value was reported after the
EB irradiation with 1 kGy dose ( Rawat and Sarma, 2013 ). Simultaneously observed, the
increase of the BOD/COD ratio with the increase of the absorbed dose confirms the con-
version of the non-biodegradable contaminants into biodegradable compounds. A similar
effect can be reached in the case of a sequential EB-irradiation, biodegradation, zero-valent
iron treatment and biodegradation to purification of heavy-loaded and toxic metalworking
fluids ( Thill et al., 2016 ). The preliminary irradiation enhances further decrease of COD by
biodegradation by about 70% for a pristine fluid, and about 24% for an exhausted fluid.
The process of radiolytic treatment of wastewaters is in large-scale industrial processing
plants incorporated into the integrated, multistep systems for remediation of wastewaters
of a different origin. Most likely, the first system was designed with gamma-irradiation
step as a commercial treatment plant near Palmdale, Florida already in the early 1970s
(Mann, 1971 ). It consisted of aeration, biodegradation, irradiation, primary filtering, and
optional sorption on activated carbon. With the capacity 38 m3/day, this setup was used
for sewage processing, in which after application of 0.5 kGy dose, a decrease of BOD from
65 to 6 mg/L was obtained, and the yield of disinfection was four orders of magnitude for
bacteria population.
Such multistep purification systems for wastewater treatment are much more often
designed with the use of electron accelerators. The example of such installations is the sys-
tem based on three electron accelerators with a total beam power 300 kW for treatment of312 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTindustrial wastewater from paper mill with output 15000 m3/day ( Shin et al., 2002 ). The
whole setup consists of several conventional treatment devices for coagulation, biological
treatment, and filtration. The suitable dose of radiation was evaluated as 1 kGy for the
wastewater with above mentioned flow rate ( Fig. 9.20A ). As it is shown by the scheme in,
for a treatment of wastewater with the initial values of COD and BOD 1100 and 800 mg/L,
respectively, depending on combination of different processing steps, a different degree of
reduction of COD (and also BOD) can be obtained (scheme in Fig. 9.20B ). Under optimized

duction, with estimated cost of treatment 1.03 USD/m3. Some more details on employed
1 MeV accelerator with irradiators can be found in the paper on its application for treating
wastewater from the textile dyeing industry ( Kuk et al., 2011 ).
The efficiency of purification of textile sewages and municipal wastewater was also
examined in the multistep system, combining EB-irradiation with a 10 MeV accelerator
(with maximum power 100 kW), coagulation, biodegradation, and absorption using acti-
vated carbon and ion-exchangers ( Emami-Meibodi et al., 2016 ). For the textile dyeing
wastewater with initial COD value 982 mg/L, irradiation with 1.1 kGy dose combined
with coagulation provided 50% reduction of COD. Moreover, with a further biodegrada-
tion step this yield was increased up to 94.6%. The greatest effect of the EB-irradiation was
observed in discoloration measurements for that system.
9.7 ECONOMIC ASPECTS
The fundamental conditions of industrial application of a given process or technology
must always take into account a deep and competent analysis of its cost-efficiency.
Because of the availability of numerous alternative methods for wastewater treatment, the
application of ionizing radiation for this purpose requires a thorough consideration of all
factors contributing to the final cost of application of this technology—usually expressed
at the end by the cost of treatment per volume unit of treated fluids. It seems, however,
that all related criteria have to be sometime reevaluated, when particular technology is not
optimal in terms of the final cost, but this is the only technology that can remove/decom-
pose certain group of pollutants of unusually strong chemical resistance.
As it has been already mentioned, the concept and pioneering investigations on applica-
tion of radiolytic treatment of wastewaters were initiated in the early 1950s ( Gerrard, 1971
and references herein). Already then, in the report from the Illinois Institute of Technology
Research, the irradiation with the isotopic sources was one out of the several recom-
mended for further study based on the comparison of ten sewage-processing methods
(UV, chemical, thermal, and several types of ionizing radiation).
The economic analysis of radiation processes was also carried out since the 1950s,
including among others, even such an opinion, that building a pipeline 5 miles long to
dump sewage in the ocean, far from the shore, is cheaper than using an irradiation process
and a short pipeline ( Gerrard, 1971 ). In one of the first60Co installations designed for the
wastewater treatment by the Florida Institute of Technology, and built in Palmdale,
Florida in 1970, the cost of wastewater treatment was evaluated as 0.39 USD/m3, and the
effluent was pure enough to use for irrigation ( Woodbridge et al., 1970 ). Detailed analysis
of the cost-efficiency for60Co source employed for radiation treatment of industrial waste-
waters was carried out with assumption that a reasonable cost of treatment should be
between about 0.05 and 0.26 USD/m3(Mytelka, 1971 ). The reported considerations
involved the application of60Co gamma source providing unit cost per 1 Curie radioactiv-
ity and a possible capacity in flow installations with flow-through irradiator employing
60Co rods. The conclusions were based on experimental data on doses required for effi-
cient treatment of simulated wastewater containing surfactant 2-naphthalene sulfonic acid314 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsodium salt and a real one with Chlorantine Fast Red dye. For the cost-efficiency, the over-
all efficiency of oxidation reactions in those two cases must be increased by factors from
2 to 25 times, which required a better understanding of the chemistry involved. This
clearly justifies a vast following of literature on radiolytic decomposition of different clas-
ses of environmental pollutants.
The evaluated costs for conducting the radiolytic gamma treatment with other isotopic
source,137Cs, are substantially higher, which was given in the paper on decomposition of
X-ray contrast media diatrizoate in different water matrices ( Gala et al., 2013 ). Evaluation
was carried out for decomposition of 25 mg/L concentration, in which a complete decom-
position requires 1 kGy dose. Based on energy that provides the disintegration of137Cs,
the cost of radioisotope needed to get required activity, and assumed flow rate 1 m3/s, the
treatment price was calculated as 16 USD/m3. This is almost two orders of magnitude
higher cost than that evaluated for different installation involving electron accelerators
(see Table 9.12 ).
With no doubt, much more attention is focused on technological applications of electron
accelerators for this purpose. Several attempts of estimating the cost efficiency of such sys-
tems were reported in the literature. In all cases they obviously point out a high capital
cost requirement, which is estimated between 1700 and 5000 kUSD ( Table 9.12 ). This
includes first of all, the cost of the accelerator, but also auxiliary equipment, transport, con-
struction, and installation. The cost of the accelerator needed for particular application
depends on required dose (D [kGy]) and assumed flow-rate (throughput capacity) of the

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTwastewater through the installation (W [kg/h]). It raises with increase of capacity and
required dose, leading to the need of use of accelerator of higher beam power (P [kW]),
according to the equation ( Gehringer et al., 1995 ):W53600 PD21η, where ηis the beam
utilization factor. The ηvalue is evaluated dosimetrically, and its value is usually between
0.6 and 0.7. The essential feature of EB accelerators is also the efficiency of conversion of
electricity power to EB power, which for modern accelerators reaches 80%, while in the
case of UV lamps is usually 20% /C030%. An additional advantageous feature of those
devices, mentioned already, is extremely high dose-rate reaching MGy/min.
With a given employed electron accelerator operating with a particular power of beam,
the volume capacity of treatment will essentially depend on the magnitude of dose
required for efficient decomposition of wastewater with particular types of contaminants.
So, for instance in installation with 1.5 MeV accelerator working at power 75 kW, at
required dose 5 kGy, the flow rate should be 610 L/min (36.6 m3/h), while for a very small
dose 50 Gy sufficient for disinfection—8043 L/min (483 m3/L) ( Kurucz et al., 1995b ). It is
obvious, that this factor significantly affects the cost efficiency. For the optimized dose
8 kGy the total treatment cost was estimated approximately 0.4 /C00.5 US cents/L. Another
essential factor is the operation cost, including fixed costs of interest and depreciation, and
variable costs of electricity, labor, maintenance etc. ( Han et al., 2012 ).
Several examples of the evaluation of cost-efficiency for different reported installations,
expressed by the cost of treatment of cubic meter of wastewater are listed in Table 9.12 .I n
the case of installation for the treatment of textile dyeing wastewater, involving three win-
dow accelerators (1 MeV, 400 kW), with using 1 kGy dose irradiation, and followed by bio-
degradation, the cost of treatment was evaluated as 0.3 USD/m3at treatment capacity
10,000 m3/day ( Han et al., 2012 ). This is comparable to the cost 0.25 USD/m3for a ground-
water treatment in an earlier reported installation with accelerator 0.5 MeV and 40 kW
beam power at 146 m3/h (Gehringer et al., 1995 ). The application in the same work of
simultaneous ozonation of irradiated solution at treatment capacity 1200 m3/h, resulted in
cost reduction down to 0.075 USD/m3. The same EB/O 3system but with beam power
75 kW was applied at 50 m3/h capacity for treatment of wastewater from molasses proces-
sing, in which operation parameters included the BOD value of treated medium not
exceeded 20 mg/L and 70% reduction of COD, which required the use of absorbed dose
2.7 kGy ( Gehringer and Fiedler, 1998 ). In this case, the cost of treatment increased to
3.17 USD/m3, and was comparable to conventional ozone/biological treatment.
The cost of EB treatment of wastewater from paper mill was compared with other exist-
ing technologies. The EB cost 1.03 USD for EB treatment was lower than three other technol-
ogies, namely the use of activated carbon filter including secondary coagulation (1.22 USD),
reverse osmosis (1.67 USD), and evaporation (over 3.00 USD) ( Shin et al., 2002 ). As the
example of a more detailed specification of different costs involved in industrial application
of EB for treatment of industrial wastewater from textile dyeing industry, Table 9.13 pre-
sents the construction and operating cost for the system installed in 2005 in South Korea
(Kuk et al., 2011 ).
Another measure suggested for economic comparison of wastewater treatment methods
is evaluation of the electrical energy per order (EE/O) figure-of-merit, which is defined as
the electrical energy (kWh) required to reduce the concentration of the pollutant by an
order of magnitude in 1000 L volume of liquid ( Woodbridge et al., 1970 ). The EE/O value316 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTis specific for decomposition of the particular compound in strictly defined experimental
conditions, and for given initial concentration. Their values evaluated, e.g., for 10 different
organic small molecule contaminants and Methylene Blue dye, can be spanned for differ-
ent conditions, for about one order of magnitude for each ( Cooper et al., 2001 ). Among
examined compounds, the smallest values 0.05 /C00.5 kWh/1000 L/order were found for
Methylene Blue due, whereas the largest, which means the need of the use of largest doses
for radiolytic decomposition—for chloroform (0.5 /C03.2 kWh/1000 L/order). Based on their
values, one can evaluate the dose ( D) required for the decrease of initial contaminant con-
centration C0to required values CDin a given radiolytic process according to the following
expression ( Cooper et al., 2001 ):

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTtreatment is not additive. It is determined by the decomposition of the most resistant com-
ponent for which the largest dose is required.
Based on the bleaching of Methylene Blue and the decay of phenol, the EE/O values
were compared for EB, UV/H 2O2,and UV/TiO 2AOPs, and values ,3 were reported for
EB and UV/H 2O2, while .50 for UV/TiO 2(Bolton et al., 1998 ). This was attributed to the
efficiency of generation ofOH radicals, which was reported as 1.0 M/kWh, while 1.4 for
UV/H 2O2and 0.087 for UV/TiO 2. A similar comparison was reported for the decomposi-
tion of two antibiotics sulfamethazole (SMX), and chlortetracycline (CTCN) in model aque-
ous solutions ( Kim et al., 2012 ). The energy consumption EE/O parameter was compared
for EB process carried out with 1 MeV, 40 kW accelerator, ozonation, and UV irradiation
at 210 nm. The obtained values EE/O 0.46, 27.53 and 1.50 for SMX, and 0.19, 7.15, and 15.5
for CTCN, for EBV, ozone, and UV, respectively, show that among investigated AOPs, the
EB treatment was electrically more energy efficient than ozonation or UV irradiation. It
was concluded, that for technological choosing the type of AOP such factors like chemi-
cals, capital, construction, and maintenance should be considered all together.
9.8 CONCLUSIONS
A limited efficiency and poor management of water systems is nowadays a fundamen-
tal issue for human water security and ecosystem sustainability ( Grant et al., 2012 ).
Among processes responsible for pollutant removal in water and waste purification sys-
tems, the last decades brought significant development of novel processes based on effi-
cient reactions of free radicals, where of special importance are advanced oxidation
processes based on the use of hydroxyl radicalsOH. One of the most efficient ways of
their production is water radiolysis by the use of ionizing radiation, although surprisingly,
it is often even not mentioned in extensive and comprehensive reviews of the field.
The effectiveness of radiolytic decomposition carried out by ionizing radiation was
demonstrated already for numerous groups of organic compounds, to which many haz-
ardous, anthropogenic environmental pollutants belong. Since the middle of the previous
century, applications of this methodology are demonstrated by various research groups all
over the world, and in various pilot installations, for the treatment of wastes of a different
origin. Especially for such complex media, it is important that it is a nonselective process,
which can be used for contaminants of different structures and properties. Its unique
advantage to other AOP methods is the possibility of carrying out parallel the decomposi-
tion both on the oxidative and reductive ways. In addition, it does not require basically
the use of any additional reagents, although in some cases, a simultaneous presence of
some chemicals, supporting production of active radicals, may enhance the yield and
improve the cost-efficiency of the process. Another important advantage of the
EB-irradiation, compared to other AOPs is the speed of radiolytic processes (occurring in
less than 1 s), incomparable to other methods, that results from EB dose-rate, evaluated, e.
g., for 1 MeV, 40 kW accelerator as 40 kGy/s ( Kuk et al., 2011 ). This technology when used
for waste treatment does not exhibit any danger of inducing radioactivity in irradiated
media, and also can be considered as a “clean technology,” producing no organic sludge318 9. GAMMA-RAY, X-RAY AND ELECTRON BEAM BASED PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTor air emission. Therefore, it can be also employed efficiently as a pretreatment step prior
to the application of biodegradation.
Studies on application of this technology for treatment of waters and wastewaters were
especially intensively carried out by numerous research groups in the 1980s and 1990s. In
spite of the construction of many pilot installations, they still have not gotten a deserved
recognition for the industrial applications, although some groups demonstrated their
numerous advantages, including cost efficiency. It seems that the main barriers for such
applications are high capital requirements in comparison to other instrumentally simpler
AOP methods, rather limited knowledge about safety of those processes, and also often
irrational fear of nuclear technology. The last couple decades have brought enlarging
knowledge about the increase of danger by numerous classes of environmental pollutants
(industrial, residues of pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors etc.), of which many are
strongly resistant, and are not eliminated from waters and wastes completely by conven-
tional methods. This creates an authentic need to search for especially efficient, nonselec-
tive methods of their decomposition. This results in a new trend of construction of hybrid
installations, in which a particularly efficient additional step is the use of EB irradiation,
added to conventional physico-chemical and biological treatment. In such circumstances
the radiolytic processes can be accrued out at economically acceptable doses, as it was
shown, e.g., for treatment of textile dyeing wastewaters ( Han et al., 2012 ), or metalworking
fluids ( Thill et al., 2016 ). This may also encourage some new interesting applications in the
future for the improvement of environmental protection and more efficient regeneration of
water systems for human security. This is also associated with the progress in the accelera-
tor technology, which is expressed not only by their increasing production for different
industrial applications, but also by lowering their costs, increase of available dose rates,
and reduction of size, which widens the spectrum of their applications, including building
of installations for wastewater treatment of different scale.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
The increasing pollution over recent decades requires the evolution of clean technolo-
gies capable to destroy wastes with the aim to obtain non-hazardous products. Often,
conventional oxidation methods do not a chieve the removal of organic compounds
present in the water. For this reason, it is necessary to use another kind of chemical oxi-
dation process called advanced oxidation pr ocesses (AOPs). AOPs consist of an aqueous
oxidation process that involves highly ac tive radicals such as hydroxyl radical (OH); it
oxidizes organic matter to CO 2and generates nontoxic reaction products. AOPs
were developed over recent decades and they were divided into AOPs using strong
reactive species mainly as O 3/H 2O2,O3/UV, H 2O2/UV, Fenton reactive (H 2O21ferrous
salts), and photo-Fenton reactive (H 2O21ferrous salts 1UV), and oxidation using
molecular oxygen at high pressure and high temperature in case of high concentrated
wastewaters (hydrothermal pr ocesses: wet air oxidation and supercritical water oxida-
tion) ( Gasso ´and Baldasano, 1996 ).Fig. 10.1 shows different advanced oxidation
technologies.
Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is a promising technology to treat a wide variety
of industrial wastewaters. The main advantage of SCWO over other treatment methods
such as landfill is that it is a destruction method. Destruction methods based on oxidation
of organic matter include biological treatment, incineration, AOP, wet air oxidation, and
supercritical water oxidation. Choosing a method to be used depends on the organic con-
tent of wastewater. For organic contents up to 1%, biological and AOP treatments are suit-
able. On the other hand, incineration is suitable to highly concentrated wastewaters but in
the range of 1% /C020% organic matter, SCWO is a better option, due to the toxic gases
produced, and the high cost of incineration.

FIGURE 10.2 Phase diagram (P,T) for water.334 10. SUPERCRITICAL WATER OXIDATION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTproperties of the liquid and vapor are approaching, until, at the critical point both equate.
At that point, there is only one phase (supercritical phase) with intermediate properties
between those for liquids and gases ( Vadillo et al., 2012 ).
Properties of water at ambient pressure and temperature were widely studied and its
behavior is well known. However, these properties undergo major changes near the criti-
cal point and they are not well characterized. Due to these changes, the study of supercriti-
cal water as a reaction medium is very desirable. Main properties of SCW are described as
follows.
10.1.1 Density
Density is a function extremely dependent on pressure near critical point as the fluid is
highly compressible. Thus, compressibility tends to infinite in the critical point. For this
reason, properties that are dependent on density such as solubility parameter, dielectric
constant, and partial molar volume of solute change due to small changes in pressure and
temperature. Fig. 10.3 shows a density-temperature diagram for water at 250 bar of
pressure.
As can be seen in the figure, water density can be controlled from liquid to gas values
just only changing temperature of the system. In the critical point, density is known as
critical density and the value is 325 kg/m3. Above the critical point, water density value is
around 100 kg/m3(Weingartner and Franck, 2005 ).
10.1.2 Dielectric Constant
Dielectric constant value for water at 25/C14C and 1 atm is 80 because molecules are joined
by hydrogen bonds. However, its value decreases to 6 at the critical point ( Weingartner
and Franck, 2005 ) and 1 /C02 at 450/C14C. For this reason, behavior of water is similar to nonpo-
lar solvent under these conditions. Thus, the low value of dielectric constant produces salt
precipitation. For example, NaCl solubility is under 100 ppm and 10 ppm for CaCl 2(Tester
et al., 1993 ).
FIGURE 10.3 Density-temperature diagram for water at 250 bar of pressure.335 10.1 INTRODUCTION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTUnder these conditions, dipole forces predominate and hence, supercritical water is a
successful solvent for organic compounds and it is completely miscible with many gases
such as oxygen. For this reason, reaction medium is homogeneous and it consists of
organic compounds, supercritical water, and oxygen. Thus, no mass transfer limitations
and oxidation reactions take place at a high rate.
10.1.3 Ionic Product
Ionic product for water (K w) is up to three orders of magnitude higher in liquid region
near critical point than at ambient temperature. For this reason, there is a high concentra-
tion of H1and OH2ions that favors organic reactions catalyzed by acids and bases.
However, once the critical point is achieved, K wdrastically diminishes; so water is a
suitable medium for free radical reactions. Thus, supercritical water oxidation takes place
by a free radical mechanism ( Li et al., 1991 ).Fig. 10.4 shows a plot of dielectric constant
and water ionic product vs. temperature at 250 bar.
10.1.4 Viscosity
Supercritical water viscosity is one order of magnitude lower than liquid water. In this
way, diffusion coefficients and ion mobility are one order of magnitude greater. At
FIGURE 10.4 Dielectric constant ( ε) and ionic product of water (K w) as a function of temperature at 250 bar.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsupercritical conditions, water viscosity is low so solute molecules diffuse easily through
supercritical water and therefore, it is a reaction medium, where reactions take place at
high velocity ( Fig. 10.5 ).
10.1.5 Heat Capacity
Its value varies with temperature and pressure. At 250 bar of pressure, heat capacity
value tends to infinity around the critical temperature. It is due to the fact that water suf-
fers a strong thermal expansion that demands a high amount of energy around the critical
point ( Shaw et al., 1991 ).Fig. 10.6 shows the variation of the water heat capacity with the
temperature at 250 bar.
The increase of the specific heat (C p) around the critical point makes water heating diffi-
cult from 350/C14C to 380/C14C at 250 bar, so the heat needed is very high. This aspect is a tech-
nical obstacle that hinders the SCWO process scale up ( Vadillo et al., 2013 ).
10.1.6 Thermal Conductivity
At constant pressure, water thermal conductivity increases with temperature up to a
maximum value around 200/C14C. Under supercritical conditions, thermal conductivity
decreases due to the rupture of the hydrogen bonds. For this reason, heat transfer coeffi-
cients are higher around the critical point and diminish above 400/C14C(Fig. 10.7 ). Thus, heat
losses are higher around the critical point than in supercritical conditions, where losses
decrease as a result of the decrease of thermal conductivity.
SCWO is an oxidation process that takes place above the critical point of water, that is,
374/C14C and 22.1 MPa. Water polarity is a function of temperature and pressure. At super-
critical conditions, water is a nonpolar solvent and it is completely miscible with organics
and gases like oxygen ( Tester and Cline, 1999 ). Under these conditions, there is a homoge-
neous reaction medium, where there are no mass transfer limitations. Furthermore, as the
reaction takes place at high velocity due to high temperature used, the residence time nec-
essary to achieve high destruction levels ( .99%) are lower than 1 min ( Svanstro ¨m et al.,
FIGURE 10.5 Viscosity ( μ) as a function of temperature at 250 bar.337 10.1 INTRODUCTION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT2004a ). Furthermore, the reaction products are not toxic. Production of NO x,S O x,and
dioxins are negligible because the temperature is too low for these compounds to be pro-
duced ( Kritzer and Dinjus, 2001 ).
10.2 DEVELOPMENT OF SCWO
During recent decades, numerous researchers focused their studies on obtaining SCWO
kinetic parameters of model compounds at laboratory scale to design SCWO reactors.
Several authors reviewed studies of model compounds ( Bermejo and Cocero, 2006b;
Brunner, 2009; Vadillo et al., 2014 ).Table 10.1 shows an actualization of the compilation of
main model compounds studied by different workers (based on Vadillo et al., 2014 ).

(Continued )339 10.2 DEVELOPMENT OF SCWO
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIn relation to reaction pathways, first, Li et al. (1991) stated that SCWO reactions take
place by free radical mechanisms. This issue was claimed by Chang and Liu (2007) who
proposed a degradation mechanism for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene based on a free radical path-
way identifying the intermediate compounds involved in this reaction. Later, Leybros
et al. (2010) studied the free radical mechanism of ion exchange resins SCWO and recently,
Gong et al. (2016) studied the reaction mechanism of quinazoline and checked the effect of
process variables on the yield of intermediate products.
On the other hand, in case of real wastewaters, which are usually a mixture of com-
pounds, the kinetic study is necessary to design and achieve an optimal operation of the
SCWO process. Since the identification of all intermediate compounds involved and the
establishment of their complex reaction mechanisms require more effort and high invest-
ment, the development of generalized kinetic models is very useful. In this way, several
authors developed generalized kinetic models. First, Li et al. (1991) proposed a generalized
kinetic model considering acetic acid, the most representative intermediate compound.
Later, this reaction mechanism was modified to represent wastewaters containing nitrogen
and chlorinated compounds being ammonia ( Webley et al., 1991; Li et al., 1993 ) and
methyl chloride, the corresponding representative intermediate compounds, respectively.
Later, Portela et al. (2001b) proposed a new generalized kinetic model based on the car-
bon monoxide formation as a refractory intermediate compound for cases, in which the
formation of acetic acid was not relevant and therefore, the application of the model pro-
posed by Li et al. (1991) would not be applicable. This model was satisfactorily used in the
case of cutting oil used in metal working industry. On the other hand, Shende and
Mahajani (1994) developed a two step kinetic model and used it to fit the results of hydro-
thermal oxidation of glyoxalic acid with and without catalyst. Later this model was used
in other works, Shende and Levec (2000) used it to model the hydrothermal oxidation ofTABLE 10.1 (Continued)

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTmaleic and fumaric acids while Lei et al. (2000) modeled the hydrothermal oxidation of
textile industrial wastewaters. Sa´nchez-Oneto et al. (2007) used this model because
it was the most adequate to represent the hydrothermal oxidation of cutting oils with
excess of oxidant.
A further step in the development of SCWO was the study of the process on real waste-
waters. First, it was satisfactorily applied to a high amount of organic wastewaters at labo-
ratory and pilot plant scale achieving removal efficiencies up to 99.9% with residence
times in the order of seconds. A compilation of more representative industrial wastewaters
studied for last two decades is shown in Table 10.2 . As it is clear from the table, most of
the studies were conducted at laboratory scale, because pilot plant and industrial scale
studies are scarce.
Due to the harsh operational conditions of the SCWO process, there are far fewer facili-
ties in supercritical water oxidation than in wet air oxidation. However, numerous pilot
plant facilities have been built up to date ( Table 10.3 ).
On the other hand, Table 10.4 shows SCWO industrial facilities commercialized to date,
highlighting the first commercial SCWO plant built by Eco Waste Technologies for the
company Hunstman Chemical Corporation in Austin (Texas). It has been operating since
1994 and shut down in 1999.
10.3 DETECTED PROBLEMS
SCWO commercial development has been hindered by some technical drawbacks, high
investment, and high operational costs ( Table 10.4 ).
Corrosion and salt precipitation are the main technical problems of SCWO. Both are
caused by the combination of a high temperature and harsh chemical environment inher-
ent to this application ( Marrone and Hong, 2009 ).
Corrosion depends on several factors such as the dissociation of acids, salts and bases,
solubility of gases, solubility of corrosion products, and the stability of the protecting
oxide layer. However, it is difficult to find a material that can stand all the conditions so it
is necessary to choose the material as function of the operation conditions ( Brunner, 2009 ).
Since corrosion problem have limited the SCWO development, it is necessary to put effort
into solving it. For this reason, during the last decade, several researchers have focused their
work on the detailed study of this phenomenon ( Kritzer and Dinjus, 2001; Brunner, 2009;
Bermejo et al., 2006a, 2006b ). Corrosion can be managed by several ways ( Marrone and
Hong, 2009 ) including a cooling strategy to avoid the conditions of high temperature and
density, (which are the conditions of high corrosion rates) ( Kritzer and Dinjus, 2001 ),
and new reactor concepts as transpiring wall or film-cooled reactors ( Vadillo et al., 2013 ).
As a consequence of the low solubility of inorganic compounds in supercritical water,
precipitation of salts occurs in SCWO reactors and can lead to equipment plugging
(Vadillo et al., 2013 ). Solid salts form conglomerations that cover the walls of the equip-
ment, reduce the heat transfer in heat exchangers, and produce plugging in pipes and
reactor. Besides, there is a dead place between the salt layer and the wall of the reactor,
where heavy corrosion can occur ( Kritzer and Dinjus, 2001 ).341 10.3 DETECTED PROBLEMS

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTFig. 10.8 shows a summary reported by Vadillo et al. (2013) including the main pro-
blems that can occur in different steps of the conventional SCWO process.
The solution to these problems is necessary to advance in the scale up of the SCWO
process. Vadillo et al. (2013) summarized main solutions to these problems such as: use of
high corrosion resistance materials (Inconel 625 and Hastelloy 600), use of liners, use of
coating, design SCWO systems including transpiring wall/film-cooled wall reactors
(Marrone and Hong, 2009 ), assisted hydrothermal oxidation ( Tateishi et al., 2000 ), use of a
base to pre-neutralize the feed stream, cold (ambient temperature) feed injection, addition
of quench water, optimization of process operating conditions ( Kritzer and Dinjus, 2001 ),
to avoid corrosive feeds or the pretreatment of the feed to remove corrosive species ( Hong
et al., 1996 ) to avoid corrosion. In case of avoiding salt precipitation, Marrone et al. (2004)
studied salt precipitation and scale control in supercritical water oxidation focused on
commercial scale applications. The methods are specific reactor designs (such as reverse
flow, tank reactor with brine pool, transpiring wall reactor, adsorption/reaction on fluid-
ized solid phase, reversible flow in tubular reactor, and centrifuge reactor) and specific
techniques (such as high velocity flow, mechanical brushing, rotating scraper, reactorTABLE 10.3 (Continued)

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTflushing, additives, low turbulence, homogeneous precipitation, crossflow filtration, den-
sity separation, and extreme pressure operation).
In this way, to avoid corrosion and salt precipitation problems, industrial wastewaters
to be treated by means of SCWO in tubular reactors, need to satisfy certain requirements
as described by Vadillo et al. (2011) .
In addition to corrosion and salt precipitation phenomena Vadillo et al. (2013) summarized
several technical drawbacks that caused the delay of the SCWO process scale up and these are:
Treatment of insoluble waste such as oily wastes or organic solvents. The pumping of
oily wastes to be treated by SCWO is a challenge due to the non-homogeneous mixture
of oil and water. Vadillo et al. (2012) reported the disadvantages of pumping a
heterogeneous wastewater. Thus, if the feed is a mixture of oil and wa ´ter, there will be
moments, in which the pump will only introduce pure oil in the reactor producing a
dangerous increase in the reactor temperature. That is the reason why, in SCWO
reactors, it is advisable to use a secondary feed pump to introduce insoluble
wastewaters in the reactor. Also, due to the variation in concentration of wastewater
feedstock during the operation, peaks of temperature along the reactor can occur,
jeopardizing the safe operation of SCWO.
Another important limitation at industrial scale is the energy required in the start-up of
the process. For this reason, the only way to achieve economic feasibility at industrial
scale is to reduce the interruptions of the process that implies continuous process start-
up.Vadillo et al. (2013) reported that it was necessary to achieve 95% of availability. It
is necessary to design a heater system to provide enough energy to the high pressure
stream to achieve supercritical temperature. For instance, in case of plants of capacity
250 t/day the thermal energy required is around 5 MW. In order to optimize the
operation costs during the start-up, Benjumea et al. (2015) proposed a new strategy to
minimize the energy required in this step. It consisted of a slow and static heating up of
the whole plant (at near critical pressure, containing a mixture of water and
isopropanol) before starting the circulation of the wastewater and feeding the oxidant.
Then, the wastewater and the oxidant were fed at a low flow rate and the oxidation
reactions started immediately releasing the heat required for autothermal operation.
In order to retain safe conditions and carry out an optimal energy recovery, a SCWO
plant with tubular reactor treating highly concentrated wastewaters must have stringent
thermal control. This can be conducted by means of cooling water injections and
multioxidant injections in different points along the reactor. Several authors have
developed and studied new configurations of reactor to improve the thermal control of
the process ( Gidner and Stenmark, 2000; Vielcazals et al., 2006; Chkoundali et al., 2008;
Benjumea et al., 2014 ). Recently, Benjumea et al. (2017) improved a 25 kg/h SCWO pilot
plant to control the amount of heat released to avoid any safety hazards installing both
cooling water and oxidant split injectors. Thus, experimental tests were carried out to
compare the operation of the pilot plant before and after those two improvements.
These improvements increased the range of wastewater concentration that could be
treated in a SCWO process. Besides, it increased the energy recovery rate and improved
the safety control of the pilot plant, while the same COD removal efficiency level was
maintained.347 10.3 DETECTED PROBLEMS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTDepressurization of effluent process is a key aspect in SCWO plants because a correct
operation implies an adequate control of system pressure ( Vadillo et al., 2013 ).
Wastewaters that contain suspended solid particles can produce problems during the
effluent depressurization because they can erode the internal parts of the “back
pressure regulator” valves. Besides, depressurization step can produce problems at
industrial scale, because at high flow rate, the use of one valve is not recommended to
get the overall pressure drop (250 bar) in a single step. Therefore, several studies were
made on the use of capillary devices to achieve the pressure drop. Results obtained by
Marias et al. (2007) showed that a depressurization system for a flow rate of 20 kg/h
should consist of 1/16 vand 21.5 m long pipe. O/C18Regan et al. (2008) proposed a capillary
system, where pressure drop is achieved distributing the total flow in several capillary
devices with a high length. They claimed that the use of only one valve produced
extreme velocities and severe erosion problems.
Later, Benjumea et al. (2011) satisfactorily conducted the high pressure reduction (up to
240 bar) in a SCWO pilot plant using a system of variable length based on three series
of coiled pipes. The system proposed was tested under different flow rates of water and
air to check its suitability in the control of the pressure. Furthermore, the experimental
results were compared with those obtained by the modelling carried out using different
friction factor correlations from the literature, for both: single-phase and two-phase
systems. None of those correlations were used before for pressure drops higher than
50 bar. Therefore, in the case of industrial plants, the use of capillary devices and a
combination of valves is desirable.
Some wastewaters can suffer pyrolysis and hydrolysis due to the preheating step (in
the absence of oxygen) that is necessary to reach 400/C14C at the tubular reactor entrance.
As a consequence of these undesirable reactions, plugging in the preheating system can
occur in addition to the presence of gas compounds in the effluent such as CH 4and
CO. The solution patented by Portela et al. (2005) avoids this phenomenon due to the
absence of organic material in the preheating line of the system.
10.4 ENERGY RECOVERY IN SCWO PLANTS
Recent SCWO studies were focused on energy production. Queiroz et al. (2015) consid-
ered supercritical water oxidation as a potential clean energy generation process. SCWO
process has to be considered not only as a process, in which a residue is completely
removed, but as a possible source of energy production due to the possibility of exploiting
the exothermicity of the oxidation reactions. Thus, it is possible to decrease the operating
costs related to extreme operating conditions (T .374/C14C, P.22.1 Mpa), that hindered the
industrial scale up and commercialization of SCWO technology. For this reason, various
researchers have addressed the issue through theoretical studies and simulation. Cocero
et al. (2002) developed an energy study for a 2 m3/h SCWO plant using the software
Aspen Plus s. Later, Bermejo et al. (2004) studied SCWO of coal including energy recovery
as an alternative to carbon power plants. However, Marias et al. (2008) claimed that
energy recovery proposed by Bermejo et al. (2004) was not feasible because it was based
on particle separation at 650/C14C and 30 Mpa and separator and turbine can not been348 10. SUPERCRITICAL WATER OXIDATION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTnowadays built using current technology. As an alternative, they proposed energy recov-
ery in SCWO using an auxiliary fluid that receives the energy produced in SCWO process.
On the other hand, Svanstro ¨m et al. (2004a) , simulated energy recovery from 10% weight
sewage sludge SCWO using Aspen Plusssoftware.
Later, Jime´nez-Espadafor et al. (2011) proposed that it is possible to decrease SCWO
treatment costs by recovering energy at low temperature and high fluid pressure, such as
water heating and steam generation. For a supercritical flow of 1000 kg/h (water and air),
the recovered energy goes from 118 kW (1700 m3/h of hot water at 65/C14C) to 75 kW
(100 kg/h of steam flow at 1.1 bar and 170/C14C). Besides, considering a rate of 15.9 kg/h of
cutting fluid with a conversion of 95%, the waste heat energy recovered would be between
71% and 45.6% of the energy content of the organic compound, a level that can be consid-
ered as high thermal efficiency.
If wastewaters have a low reaction heat, the use of auxiliary fuels is desirable to
increase the temperature profile along the reactor and to achieve the autothermal opera-
tion ( Bermejo and Cocero, 2006b ). Thus, hydrothermal flames are generated in SCWO
reactors, including devices specially designed for it. Several authors studied hydrothermal
flames for more than twenty years. A hydrothermal flame is a combustion flame produced
in aqueous medium under conditions of temperature and pressure above the critical point
of water. They are characterized by high temperatures, typically above 1000/C14C, higher
reaction rates, and residence times around 10 /C0100 ms in which complete oxidation of the
reactants is achieved ( Vadillo et al., 2013 ).
The preheating of the fuel and the oxidant until a high temperature is required to pro-
duce the flame. If temperature is high enough for the waste concentration, the autoignition
of the mixture is produced ( Augustine and Tester, 2009 ). Deeper studies on hydrothermal
flames formation can be found in the literature ( Wellig et al., 2005, 2009 ).
From an engineering point of view, the design of SCWO reactors with flame generation
was studied by Bermejo et al. (2011) . Specifically, they studied the scale up process in a
transpiring wall reactor with hydrothermal flame as an internal heat source. That work
showed the remarkable effect of the fluid velocity over the injection temperature to get a
stable flame generation. At low velocity in the injector extinction, temperature is low as
well as it being possible to inject at 170/C14C and 0.04 m/s. They designed a transpiring wall
reactor (L 50.4 m Di 50.33 m) to treat 3000 kg/h of waste injected at 25/C14C using modeling.
Refractory compounds such as acetic acid and ammonia can be oxidized due to the high
temperature in SCWO reactors with hydrothermal flames.
Thus, Cabeza et al. (2011) used a tubular reactor with a residence time of 0.7 s to oxidize
those compounds using IPA (isopropyl alcohol) as cofuel. In the case of acetic acid, tem-
perature was increased to 750/C14C achieving 99% of removal. However, in the case of ammo-
nia, removal was under 94% even if temperature was higher than 710/C14C. Besides, it was
found that concentration under 2% weight did not produce ignition of ammonia solutions.
Recently, Queiroz et al. (2015) studied deoxidation under a hydrothermal flame of
biomass. They claimed that it can intensify the SCWO process in order to develop micro-
combustors to produce high pressure and temperature steam from wastes. However, this
execution needs the development of technical solutions for injecting biomass in a hydro-
thermal flame combustor, and equipment for energy recovery must be developed and
engineered.349 10.4 ENERGY RECOVERY IN SCWO PLANTS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT10.5 ECONOMIC ASPECTS
Due to the nature and characteristics of SCWO process, high investment costs are
required. On one hand, equipment must be able to work at high pressure and temperature
and, on the other hand, corrosion problems lead to use high corrosion resistance alloys to
build reactors and heat exchangers (preferably alloys with high nickel content). In addition
to high material costs, the maintenance and repair costs of equipment that works under
extreme conditions are very high too. Therefore, the initial investment required is high
and the only way to make the SCWO process economically feasible is reaching the auto-
thermal regime in the reactor. During the last years, several authors have studied the
process’ economics. Abeln et al. (2007) estimated that tubular reactor costs represent 10%
of the overall equipment costs in a SCWO plant able to treat 100 kg/h of wastewater.
Later, Marulanda and Bolan ˜os (2010) estimated that reactor costs represent 7% of the
overall equipment costs in a mobile SCWO plant able to treat 1 L/h of organic wastewater.
Besides, the choice of the oxidant is a key point from the point of view of operational cost,
Bermejo and Cocero (2006a) claimed that it is cheaper to use pure oxygen instead of air
because at industrial scale, the compression cost is very high. On the other hand, Savage
et al. (1999) suggested that catalytic SCWO process is a more competitive alternative
because using a catalyst, the temperature necessary to reach removal efficiencies higher
than 99% is reduced significantly decreasing the energy demand.
Gidner and Stenmark (2000) estimated operational costs of a sewage sludge SCWO
plant based on a flow rate 7 m3/h of sewage sludge being 137 h/t dried sludge.
Svanstro ¨m et al. (2004b) estimated total cost for a 1 t/day plant being 243 $/t dried
sludge. O’Regan et al. (2008) claimed that treatment cost of sewage sludge SCWO is in
the range 36.6 273.15h/t.Abeln et al. (2007) first estimated treatment cost of an ideal
wastewater made of a mixture of ethanol 10% weight and water using air as oxidant in a
plant of 100 kg/h with two different reactors: tubular and transpiring wall reactor, and
the treatment costs 406 h/t and 660 h/t, respectively. Later, they estimated the treatment
cost for a 1 t/h plant being 330 /C0430h/t for the transpiring wall reactor plant and
203/C0264h/t for the tubular reactor plant. Marulanda and Bolan ˜os (2010) also estimated
that treatment cost for a mobile SCWO unit ab le to treat 1 L/h of oils contaminated with
PCBs amounts to 75 $/L.
Based on the results obtained at pilot plant scale, Vadillo et al. (2011) elaborated an eco-
nomic analysis for an industrial SCWO plant capable of treating 1 m3/h of flammable
industrial wastewater with a concentration of 90 g O 2/L. Thus, the main components con-
sidered in the SCWO plant were: a tubular reactor made of stainless steel AISI 316, a
counter current heat exchanger, a high pressure pump, a cooler, and two back-pressure
regulators. The oxidant was pure oxygen supplied by a cryogenic oxygen storage plant
bearing in mind the use of 10% of excess. All in all, the estimated overall cost for the
SCWO treatment of wastewater in a 1 m3/h plant with tubular reactor technology was 109
h/t wastewater, bearing in mind depreciation time over 10 years and an operating period
of 330 days/year.
Economic results showed that although SCWO technology was initially shown as a
technology suitable for all kind of wastes, research conducted over the last three decades350 10. SUPERCRITICAL WATER OXIDATION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTshowed that this technology can only be applied at industrial scale using tubular reactor
and to treat wastewaters that satisfy the requirements described by Vadillo et al. (2011) .
10.6 CONCLUSIONS
S C W Oh a st ob ec o n s i d e r e da saf e a s i b l et e chnology that respects the environment
and achieves the removal of those toxic wastes that can not be destroyed by any conven-
tional technology. SCWO has been developed for decades from laboratory scale to com-
mercial scale. Although SCWO technology was initially shown as a technology
suitable for a wide range of organic wastewat ers, this technology has some technical lim-
itations and can only be applied at industrial s cale to treat wastewaters that satisfy a list
of requirements. In order to advance in the commercial development of SCWO, it is cru-
cial to select an appropriate wastewater and to choose the most suitable reactor concept
(as transpiring wall reactor, multioxidant re actor, reactor including hydrothermal flames,
etc.), the correct operational method (betw een the conventional feed system or a direct
feed injection), and the appropriate technic al solution (to handle solids, to avoid pyroly-
sis/hydrolysis, etc.). Besides, from an economical point of view, the design of SCWO
plants has to include an energy recovery system in order to achieve the economic feasi-
bility of the process.

11.1 INTRODUCTION
Conventional methods for water treatment are inefficient to remove toxic and bio-
recalcitrant organic micropollutants, when compared to electrochemical processes, which
implement clean and effective techniques for the direct or indirect generation of hydroxyl
radicals.
Organic micropollutants like persistent organic pollutants (POPs), herbicides, and pesti-
cides are compounds, which have been found at relatively high contents in the aquatic
environment, and have increased the toxicity levels in water where the conventional
treatments have not found a solution for this problem successfully. The electrochemical
methods have been a key to resolve such major drawbacks.
These procedures called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) use a very strong oxidiz-
ing agent such as hydroxyl radical (KOH) with E/C14(KOH/H 2O)52.8 V/NHE, generated
in situ in the reaction medium. These radicals react rapidly with organics mainly either by
dehydrogenation or hydroxylation.
Electrochemical advanced oxidation process was described earlier, which focused on
electrochemistry in general and environmental electrochemistry in particular. Electro-
Fenton was the first technology to be considered as an EAOP because of the production
and the active role of hydroxyl radical on the oxidation of organics.
This technology is based on the processes:
the electrochemical regeneration of iron(II) from iron(III) species on the cathodic
surface, and
the cathodic formation of hydrogen peroxide from the reduction of oxygen.
These processes lead to the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl
radicals.
A brief difference between AOPs and EAPs are given in Table 11.1 .

An electron donor (reductant) transfers one or more electrons to an electron acceptor
(oxidant), which has a higher affinity. A chemical transformation takes place during the
electron transfer in both the oxidant and the reductant, giving rise to chemical species
with an odd number of valence electrons. These species, known as radicals, are highly
unstable and reactive due to the presence of this unpaired electron.
One of the key focuses is to clarify the high efficiencies by EAOPs in the evacuation of
natural toxins by intervened oxidation form s in the general oxidation completed amid the
treatment. Intervened oxidation in EAOPs can be caught on as the oxidation of toxins con-
tained in wastewater by the substance respon se between these mixes and oxidants created
already on the anode surfaces. In this way, AO does not just lead to the immediate oxidation
of natural contaminants on the anode surface; h owever, it additionally advances the develop-
ment of tremendous measures of oxidants, whi ch can act on the surface of the cathodes as
well as amplify the oxidation procedure to th e arrangement majority of the treated waste
(Panizza and Cerisola, 2009 ). The sort and augmentation of the generation of oxidants rely
upon many information sources, the anode mat erial being the most important and the event
of reasonable crude matter for the creation of o xidants in the wastewat er. Their impact on the
proficiency of EAOPs is imperative in light of the fact that the oxidation of poisons is
s t r e t c h e do u tf r o mt h er e g i o no ft h ea n o d es u r f a c et ot h em a i np a r to ft h ee l e c t r o l y t e .
Notwithstanding, it ought to be taken into account that these oxidants generally influence the
instruments of the oxidation of contaminants and, periodically, they can prompt the arrange-
ment of undesirable intermediates or last stab le items. At times, the species that advance the
development of oxidants are not contained in the wastewater, be that as it may included as
reagents, which brings about understanding of exceptionally successful procedures. A stand-
out amongst the most fascinating cases is the treatment of squanders with Ag (II), whose
arrangement was shown to be extremely viable with conductive cathodes ( Panizza et al.,
2000)(Fig. 11.1 ).
However, the most referenced example of mediated electrochemical oxidation arises
from the effect of chlorides on the oxidation of organics. Chlorides are commonly con-
tained in most of the wastewater flow streams and they are known to be easily oxidized to
chlorine by many types of anode materials. This gaseous oxidant diffuses into the waste-
water and forms hypochlorite and chloride in the reaction medium by disproportionation.
Deprotonation of hypochlorous acid produces hypochlorite. Since hypochlorite is the pri-
mary final product, in literature, it is common to find the direct transformation of chlorideTABLE 11.1 Different T ypes of AOPs and EAPs

cies depends on the concentration and pH.

The subsequent blend (chlorine, hypochlorite, and hypochloric corrosive) is very
responsive with numerous organics, being effective for their mineralization ( Comninellis
and Nerini, 1995; Panizza and Cerisola, 2003 ). Notwithstanding, it is likewise known to
frame numerous organo-chlorinated species as intermediates and lasts that can be consid-
erably more unsafe than the crude poison. These species are regularly very difficult and
even the arrangement of low sub-atomic weight items, for example, (a chemical that
causes unconsciousness, if you breathe its vapors) turns into a very huge issue. This will
be expanding (almost completely/basically) and the costs of the remediation are huge
(Can˜izares et al., 2003 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTRegardless of the way that chlorine intervened oxidation is extremely outstanding, it is
by all account not the only instance of interceded oxidation forms and, obviously, it is not
the most critical one. Subsequently, when the goal is centered on the advancement of inter-
ceded oxidation, two vital angles ought to be considered:
direct electrochemical generation of oxidants on the anode surface from non-oxidant
species contained in the waste, and
transport of these species towards the mass (wastewater). The crude matter for the
generation of oxidants ought to be contained in the wastewater or dosed and, normally,
it can be a particle (i.e., chloride, sulfate, and so forth), a natural poison (acidic
corrosive), broke down gases (oxygen) or even water.
11.2.1 Photoelectrochemical Processes
There is an expanding enthusiasm for the utilization of photoelectrochemical procedures
for water and wastewater remediation. These photo-assisted medications depend on the illu-
mination of a debased arrangement or a photoactive anode with UV or a sun oriented light
source; UV-A ( λ5315/C0400 nm), UV-B ( λ5285/C0315 nm), and UV-C ( λ,285 nm) lights
provided by UV lights as vitality sources are usually utilized. The force and wavelength of
such radiations have noteworthy impact on the pulverization rate of natural contaminants.
Even when the cost is above normal, the use of UV-assisted procedures is very useful. This
is settled in sun power-assisted forms, in which daylight ( λ.300 nm) is utilized as a free,
economical and sustainable power source, although every now and again, the impact of this
radiation has been evaluated utilizing a sun powered test system gadget. In the future, the
qualities and fundamental uses of the most intriguing photoelectrochemical forms including
photoelectro-Fenton (PEF), sun powered photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF), photoelectrocatalysis
(PEC), and cross breed frameworks, are depicted.
11.2.2 Photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) and Solar Photoelectro-Fenton
(SPEF) Processes
PEF with simulated UV-A light and SPEF(its determined daylight assisted technique),
have been conceived and broadly created by the Brillas’ gathering ( Brillas et al., 2009; Sire ´s
and Brillas, 2012 ). These procedures include the treatment of the sullied arrangement
under EF conditions alongside the concurrent illumination with UV-A or sun based light
to quicken the mineralization rate of organics. Oxidizing hydroxyl radicals are delivered
from Fenton’s response, while the undesired amassing of unmanageable Fe(III) particles
that decelerate the treatment are maintained at a strategic distance from the reductive pho-
tolysis of [Fe (OH)]21. The transcendent Fe(III) species are in arrangement at pH 2.8 /C03.5,
as indicated by the photograph ( Fig. 11.2 ), in the manner of recovering Fe21(i.e., the impe-
tus in Fenton’s response) and delivering more radicals ( Brillas et al., 2009; Sire ´s and
Brillas, 2012 )(Fig. 11.3 ).
The radiation can also promote the photolysis of some oxidation intermediates or their
Fe(III) complexes that allows the regeneration of Fe21as similar to photodecarboxylation
reactions.362 11. ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe investigation of the SPEF procedure has been stretched out to a 10 L pre-pilot
plant ( Isarain-Chavez et al., 2011 ). This plant has an indistinguishable part with a
reactor of 90.3 cm2cathode zone coupled to a 1.57 L solar compound parabolic collec-
tor (CPCs) as the photoreactor. The examin ation was centered on the advancement of
the SPEF treatment of the paracetamol utiliz ing a Pt/adenine cell by reaction surface

High Performance Liquid Chromotagraphy (HPLC) investigation of electrolyzed
arrangements permitted recognizing hydroquinone and different benzoquinones as sweet-
smelling intermediates, which were expelled byOH, though maleic, fumaric, succinic,
lactic, oxalic, formic, and oxamic acids were distinguished as carboxylic acids. As of late,

0.5 mM Fe21of pH 3.0 utilizing a similar framework at 7.0. It was exhibited that aggregate
decolorization was practical at 120 min. About 94% mineralization with 197 kWh (kg
TOC)21vitality utilization was accomplished in 150 min.

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe SPEF corruption of 100 mg/L TOC of arrangements with the beta-blockers atenolol,
metoprolol tartrate, and propranolol hydrochloride in 0.10 M Na 2SO4with 0.5 mM Fe21at
pH 3.0 was tried utilizing single Pt/adenine and BDD/adenine cells and furthermore,
their blend with a Pt/CF cell to upgrade Fe21recovery from Fe31decrease ( Isarain-
Chavez et al., 2011 ). Some processes demonstrate the outline of the consolidated BDD/
Adenine-Pt/CF cell. For instance, some processes highlight for a 0.246 mM metoprolol tar-
trate arrangement, the prevalence of joined cells over single ones, BDD over Pt and SPEF
over EF in regards to the TOC decrease. This can be clarified by the more noteworthy crea-
tion ofOH from Fenton’s response in the consolidated cells, the higher oxidizing energy
of BDD (OH) and the photolytic activity of daylight in SPEF, effortlessly derived from the
pseudo-arrangement of cells.
In any case, the Pt/ADE-Pt/CF cell gave the most minimal vitality utilization of
80 kWh (kg TOC)21for 88% /C093% mineralization, being the most practical framework for
mechanical application ( Fig. 11.4 ).
11.2.3 Photoelectrocatalysis (PEC)
The PEC strategy depends on the collaboration amongst electrochemistry and photoca-
talysis to give significantly more noteworthy productivity for wastewater remediation.
Conventional photocatalysis has been broadly created utilizing the nanocrystalline anatase
type of TiO 2for light-initiated oxidation of natural toxins in waters ( Brillas, et al., 2009;
Daghrir et al., 2012; Georgieva et al., 2012; Martı ´nez-Huitle and Ferro, 2006 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThis semiconductor material has extremely alluring properties for example, minimal
effort, low poisonous quality, and a wide band crevice of 3.2 eV, which brings about a
decent strength and anticipates photocorrosion. Exposure of anatase TiO 2nanoparticles,
either in colloidal suspension or, on the other hand, kept as a thin film on Ti, by UV
photons of adequate vitality ( λ,380 nm) promotes an electron from the valence band to
the conduction band (e2

Organics can then be specifically oxidized by the hole or by heterogeneous hydroxyl
radical generated from the reaction between the photogenerated opportunity and
adsorbed water.

In addition, other weaker receptive oxygen species (ROS), (like superoxide radical parti-
cles O/C152

Then again, the PEC technique comprises the use of either a steady present or a consis-
tent inclination anodic potential (E anod) to a semiconductor-based thin film anode sub-
jected to UV exposure for the ceaseless extraction of photoinduced electrons by an outside
electrical circuit ( Daghrir et al., 2012; Georgieva et al., 2012 .).
The electrolytic cells utilized as a part of PEC are mixed tanks or stream reactors that
allow the section of UV light specifically to the arrangement or through a quartz window
to achieve the uncovered surface of the photoanode with the base loss of occurrence illu-
mination ( Fig. 11.5 ).
11.2.4 Hybrid Combinations of PEF and PEC
The decolorization of a few dyes has been upgraded by consolidating PEF and TiO 2
photocatalysis (TiO 2/UV) by Khataee et al. (2010, 2012) , who improved the exploratory
conditions utilizing reaction surface strategy. These creators used open, unified, and tube-
shaped mixed tank reactors of 1 or 3 L limit outfitted with a Pt anode, a cathode made of365 11.2 ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcarbon nanotubes immobilized onto a graphite surface (CNT/graphite) with air supply;
6 W UV-C light presented in a quartz tube and TiO 2nanoparticles immobilized on paper
or glass plates covering the internal surface of the phone. The decolorization rate of azo
color acid yellow 36 diminished in the following order:
PEF-TiO 2=UV.PEF.EF.TiO 2=UV.UV photolysis
The ideal factors for the previous joined process were 25 mg/L of dye, 0.15 mM Fe31,
127 min of treatment, and 115.6 mA, yielding a most extreme shading expulsion of 83%.
The operation costs identified with the utilization of the UV light were as high as 16.5
kWh/m3, though the electrical vitality utilization was just 0.88 kWh/m3. Then again, a
few likewise endeavors have been made to improve the oxidation capacity of PEC by
coupling its with EF, albeit more work is expected to affirm the utilization of such
joined forms.
Xie and Li (2006) utilized quartz reactor for the removal of azo dye orange G for 5 h by
various strategies. The cell was loaded with 30 mL of a 0.1 mM arrangement of the dye
containing 0.01 M Na 2SO4at pH 6.2. 8 W, and UV-A light was utilized as a light source.
Orange G was not specifically photolyzed under UV-A light, being marginally crushed
(ca. 3%) by AO with a TiO 2/Pt cell at E anod510.71 V/SCE and achieving 8% by TiO 2
photocatalysis; of course, if little amounts of oxidizing species (OH and additionally
holes) are shaped at the TiO 2surface. The PEC procedure utilizing the Pt/TiO 2cell
improved the dye removal to 25% because of the photogeneration of more oxidizing holes.
The oxidation capacity of this procedure expanded up to yield half dye devastation, when
the Pt cathode was supplanted by a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) anode at
FIGURE 11.5 Enhancement of photoelectrocatalysis efficiency using nanostructured electrodes.366 11. ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTEcat520.54 V/SCE, making the oxidation of dye conceivable with H 2O2created from O 2
diminishment. Strangely, orange G vanished totally, while applying PEF with a Fe/RVC
cell utilizing ca. 17 mg/L Fe21, pH 3.0, and E cat520.71 V/SCE. Moreover,
the decolorization rate somewhat expanded in the event on coupling EF under
similar conditions to PEC utilizing a TiO 2/RVC cell; thus the extra development of a lot of
homogeneousOH radicals from Fenton’s, and additionally the stress caused by Fenton
response.
Similarly, PEC combined with EF gave the most noteworthy mineralization of 74% in
5h(Peralta-Herna ´ndez et al., 2006 ). It portrayed a solid change of the decolorization profi-
ciency and TOC evacuation by PEC coupled to EF in contrast with EF alone utilizing a
concentric annular unified TiO 2/graphite material stream cell with a focal 75 mW/cm2
UV-A light in bunch operation mode.
11.2.5 Sonoelectrochemical Processes
Ultrasound (US) can deliver very receptive radicals from water and also the pyrolysis
of natural poisons contained in such lattices. Be that as it may, its oxidation capacity is
fairly low and, subsequently, it is generally consolidated with other oxidants like H 2O2,
O2, UV, and Fenton’s reagent for water remediation ( Garbellini et al., 2008; Gonza ´lez-
Garcı ´a et al., 2010; Oturan et al., 2008 )(Fig. 11.6 ).
The investigation of the blend of US and terminal procedures, and the use of sonoelec-
trochemical innovation to the burning of organic compounds and flow dynamic are cur-
rent active research fields ( Gonza ´lez-Garcı ´a et al., 2010 ). This segment depicts the qualities
of sonoelectrolysis and sonoelectro-Fenton, which are the most critical sonoelectrochemical
forms used to sterilize wastewater.
FIGURE 11.6 Schematic representation of (A) Electrochemical cell and (B) Sonoelectrochemical cell.367 11.2 ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT11.2.6 Sonoelectrolysis
The compound instrument is found at high recurrence and includes the homolytic frac-
ture of H 2O, and broke up O 2to yield distinctive ROS (OH, HO 2, andO). The physical
system is alleged sonication and comprises in the creation of cavitation microbubbles,
which develop and fall, starting extraordinary breaking powers with a great degree of
high temperatures (up to 6000K) and weights (of the request of 104 kPa). Under these con-
ditions, organics can be specifically pyrolyzed and the sonolysis of water can occur, where
() means the US, while created OH in this way quickens the organics oxidation.
H2O1/C15ÞÞÞ-/C15OH1/C15H (11.14)
Additionally, the solid cavitational crumple close to the anode surface improves the
mass transport of the electroactive species and the cleaning of the anodes’ surfaces by dis-
solving or setting the repressing layers ( Garbellini et al., 2008 ; Garbellini, 2012). Every one
of these marvels to a great extent enhances the decimation rate of organics, in the long run
supporting the mineralization procedure in sonoelectrolysis. A few test setups have been
imagined for sonoelectrochemical tests and these are ( Gonza ´lez-Garcı ´a et al., 2010 ):
inundation of the electrochemical cell inside a US shower,
coupling of the electrolytic cell with the ultrasonic tip through a glass divider or filled
fluid chambers,
utilization of a sonoelectrochemical cell, where the terminals and the ultrasound tip are
straightforwardly dunked into the working arrangement, which turns out to be the
most utilized course of action, and
concurrent utilization of the ultrasound tip as ultrasound producer and as cathode.
By far, most of research in sonoelectrolysis has been completed at lab scale with exclu-
sively planned frameworks in light of effective US horns dunked into customary glass
electrochemical vessels. This strategy is exceptionally costly and has proved a few down-
sides identified with reproducibility, scale-up, and plan perspectives, which have backed
off its further improvement.
11.2.7 Sonoelectro-Fenton (SEF)
SEF is a process applied under EF conditions to an acidic solution. This novel strategy
has been utilized for the debasement of herbicides 2,4-D and 4,6-dinitro-o-cresol utilizing a
unified Pt/CF tank reactor with a clay piezoelectric transducer put on its base to supply
energies of 20, 60, and 80 W at a low recurrence of 28 kHz.
The predominance of SEF over EF and substance Fenton was shown for the treatment
of the cationic dye red X-GRL ( Li et al., 2010 ) and azure B ( Martı ´nez and Uribe, 2012 ). An
air-soaked arrangement of 1 L of 37.5 mg/L of the previous dye with 0.05 M Na 2SO4and
5m MF e21of pH 3.0 in a unified tank reactor with a Ti/RuO 2anode and an initiate car-
bon fiber cathode, each of 100 mm 390 mm regions, was corrupted by EF at 8.9 mA/cm2.
Relative SEF trials were made utilizing a US arrangement of 20 kHz and energies of 80,
120, and 160 W with the horn plunged into the arrangement at 20 mm of its surface, put
between the terminals. The dye was dependably totally decolorized in 180 min, in spite of368 11. ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTthe fact that shading evacuation was upgraded by SEF, where it expanded as US vitality
rose. A comparable pattern was found for TOC rot, which ascended from 75% in EF to
83% in SEF at 160 W. For 0.5 mM sky blue B, it was found that the steady rate for its rot in
SEF by applying E cat520.7 V/SCE to a RVC cathode under US of 91 W and 24 kHz was
10-overlap that of direct sonolysis and two-fold increase than the one acquired by com-
pound Fenton under noiseless conditions. As need be, COD was decreased 68% in 60 min
by Fenton, while a much vast estimation of up to 85% was acquired by SEF.
11.3 ADVANTAGES
prevention and remediation of pollution problems as electron is a clean reagent,
high energy efficiency,
amenability to automation,
easy handling as the equipment is simple to handle, safe, and versatile, and
applied to effluents with COD in the range from 0.1 g/L to 100 g/L.
11.4 DISADVANTAGES
The cost is high, when related to electrical supply.
There is low conductance of many wastewaters that require the addition of electrolytes.
Another disadvantage is the decline of activity and shortening of the electrode lifetime
by fouling due to the deposition of organic material on their surface.
11.5 APPLICATIONS
Applications in wastewater treatment: Electrochemical processes have been a major
solution for environmental remediation for the past few decades. The most significant
one is by treating liquid coming from industries and electro-kinetic soil remediation
processes ( Barrera-Dı ´az et al., 2014 ).
Electrolysis and electro-coagulation are the pretreatment processes, which are one of
the most promising technologies in recent trends. Electro-coagulation process is capable
of removing turbidity, decolorization of dyes, and breakup of wastes consisting of
emulsions ( Canizares et al., 2009 ).
In the electrolysis process, coarse removal of pollution in the industrial waste cannot
be implemented as the amount of energy required for the removal of pollutants on the
concentration of pollution is large. Electrolysis treats effluents polluted with
anthropogenic organic species, within a concentration range of 1000 /C020,000 mg
chemical oxygen demand (COD) dm23for direct anodic oxidations.
Electrolysis with conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation exhibits properties,
which are exceptionally good, when compared to other advanced oxidation
processes like:
robustness to attain complete mineralization of almost any type of organic without
producing refractory final products,369 11.5 APPLICATIONS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTefficiency, when it is operated under no diffusion control, current efficiencies are
close to 100%, and
integration capability, it is easily coupled with other treatment technologies and fed
with green energy sources and photovoltaic panels.
Applications on surface of electrodes: EAOPs are commonly divided into two groups,
based on the mechanisms of the overall oxidation development: surface of the
electrons/ bulk of the electrochemical cell ( Barrera-Dı ´az et al., 2014 ).
Surface controlled processes, also known as anodic oxidation processes, which occur
near the surface of the electrode, has three categories that are distinguished based on
the oxidation mechanisms:
direct electron-transfer processes,
hydroxyl radical processes, and
heterogeneous photocatalytic processes.
Electrochemical oxidation process can be us ed for the treatment of landfill leachates
and evaluation of toxicity in allium cepa (Klauck et al., 2013 ). In this study, the
effectiveness of the advanced oxidation p rocess of electrochemical oxidation in
leachate treatment was evaluated, and tox icity assessment of the sample before and
after treatment was also observed. During the treatment process, the removal of dye
was appreciable whereas, the removal of chlorine odor was not up to the mark
because chlorine ions prese nt in abundance in the leachate can often act as oxidants
in indirect electrochemical oxidation of or ganic matter. It was finally concluded that
the treatment was effective in removing the physico-chemical pa rameters. However,
the eco-toxicological test indicated that t he effluent became as toxic as the initial
sample.
Further optimization of the parameters like pH, time, and current should be carried
out, along with application of integrated treatment systems, ozone, electro- and
photooxidation processes, characterization of the leachate after biological treatment, a
test with other biomarkers, and characterization of organic compounds and by-products
generation. All this optimization should be carried out.
11.6 CURRENT SCENARIO
Electrocatalytic activity and stability of electrode materials, optimized reactor geometry,
and reactor hydrodynamics is the field, are under intense investigation due to their
expanding field.
Pilot scale for EAOPs has reached an advanced stage, which has been used for commer-
cialization for disinfectants and purification of wastewater pollutants with organic
compounds.
One of the major successful large scale application of EAOPs is the automated disinfec-
tion of swimming pool water using boron doped diamond (BDD) anode products such as
Oxineosand Sysneos. They have been developed for both private and public pools.
Major advantages in implementing this method are:
absence of chlorine smell,
no accumulation of chemicals,370 11. ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION PROCESSES
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTno need of antialgae, and
residual action to resist jagged disinfections.
Companies including CONDIAS and Advanced Diamond Technologies Inc. do research
and development to supply equipments for AO with BDD anode. Major applications of
these cells are water disinfection and industrial wastewater treatment.
EAOPs in EctoSyss, provide a reliable and sustainable disinfection of the ballast water
in an economical and ecological way.
A BDD electro-oxidation pilot plant was installed in Marelo (Cantabria, Spain) for the
treatment of landfill leachates using AOPs followed by EAOPs.
11.7 FUTURE PROSPECTS
Points of view of improving interceded o xidation for future EAOP advancements
appear to be positive. Interceded oxidation forms turn into the key indicate to achievean improvement in the proficiency of EAOPs . It is not the generation of oxidants, but
rather their initiation in the response media is all the more intriguing points ofresearch.
Expenses of innovation are high and changes in proficiency are not generally in thesame class as to propose their coupling with EAOPs. This is an immediate outcome ofthe immense measures of scattered vitality with this innovation. Any curiosity in this
theme needs to originate from a more proficient utilization of vitality with a specific
end goal to advance the arrangement of numerous problem areas, where radicalresponses could be initiated.
Interestingly, light illumination as of now is by all accounts an extremely encouragingoption with great points of view to be utilized as a part of the not so distant future. Thesynergistic impact of the actuation of oxidants has been plainly showed and the vitalityilluminated is much lower than that connected.
The utilization of the eminent BDD anode essentially improved the oxidation power
and mineralization proficiency due to the creation of supplementary hydroxyl radicals
at the anode surface. Hence, this innovation turns out to be presently developedenough to pass to pilot-scale reactor plan and application to treatment of huge volumesof wastewaters. The initial step will be the origination and plan of a pilot-scale reactor.This origination can incorporate consolidated procedures to build the adequacy of thetreatment.
Group reactor and persistent (stream) reactor ought to be considered. The displaying ofthe procedure can be helpful to upgrade the working parameters and foresee the
conduct of contaminations and can help for prudent and handy application to the
genuine wastewater treatment.
The coupling with an organic procedure as pre- or post-treatment unit is anotherpromising way for a financially know-how treatment. Some current reviews havedemonstrated the attainability of such a coupling.
In truth, the EF procedure can change harmful as well as bio-refractory particles tobiodegradable species amid a short treatment time. The entire mineralization of371 11.7 FUTURE PROSPECTS
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTarrangements in this manner acquired at that point can be accomplished by natural
treatment.
To create fiscal capacity, the utilization of a green and cheap vitality source in light of
daylight driven electrical power frameworks, for example, an EF reactor specifically
controlled by photovoltaic boards can likewise be considered.
Consideration regarding propelled terminals and reactors, alongside process
demonstrating can prompt an exhaustive extension of procedures into all zones of
ecological conservation, including remediation of sullied waters, vaporous streams, and
soils. There exists an idealistic foundation in light of the fact that a critical advance has
been proven from the improvement of novel cathodes and layers, and the enhancement
of the reactor setup. For instance, the advancement of more proficient numerous stage
oxidation and three-dimensional terminal reactors.
A basic examination of the prompt difficulties of the photoelectrochemical forms for the
treatment of natural poisons in water needs to concentrate on the particularities of PEC
and SPEF, given their prevalence.
Expected advancements considering the uncovered outcomes on PEC proposals with
the elective mix of SPEC with SPEF, a half and half framework that has not been tried
yet, since it would be considerably more conservative than the PEC mixes.

Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation

12.1 INTRODUCTION
The aim of wastewater treatment is to red uce the load of pollutants from water and
to meet the discharge regulati ons. Wastewaters containing h igh concentrations of persis-
tent, toxic, and nonbiodegradable organic pollut ants (e.g., aromatics, pesticides, etc.) are
hard to treat with conventional physi cal-chemical or biological methods ( Munoz et al.,
2015). Many techniques such as adsorption, m embrane filtration, and floatation can
only collect or transfer the pollutants from on e phase to another. In contrast, advanced
oxidation processes (AOPs) can: (1) degrade an d mineralize various persistent organic
pollutants effectively without addition of hazardous substances ( Bali et al., 2003; Shu
et al., 2016 ), (2) oxidize the pollutants at a relatively low concentration of the reagents
(Buthiyappan et al., 2016; Meric et al., 2005 ), and (3) improve the biodegradability of the
treated wastewater ( Vogelpohl and Kim, 2004 ).
One of the most famous AOPs in wastewater treatment is the homogeneous Fenton pro-
cess. Briefly, Fe21is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to Fe31, forming a hydroxyl radical
(OH) and a hydroxide ion in the process. Fe31is then reduced back to Fe21by another
molecule of hydrogen peroxide, forming a hydroperoxyl radical (HO/C15
2) and a proton. A
very rapid decomposition of the producedOH occurs and the rate of oxidation is reduced
due to the slow regeneration of Fe21to Fe31. The homogeneous Fenton process is very
efficient and fast in degradation of organic pollutants; but it has some shortcomings as
follows ( Diya’uddeen et al., 2012 ):
The Fenton process is efficient in acidic pH (2 /C04) and inefficient at higher pH due to
precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxide in solution. This means large amounts of acid and
base are needed to adjust the pH for the optimum condition and for the final
neutralization, respectively. Therefore, the salinity of the final wastewater increases.

its recovery and reuse is difficult.
Complete mineralization of organic compounds needs a large excess of the iron salt and
hydrogen peroxide, which makes the process relatively cost-ineffective.
Ross and Chowdhury (1977) had one of the first papers on catalytic oxidation of waste-
waters using heterogeneous Fenton process using solid catalyst. However, the term “cata-
lytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO)” was coined for the first time for the heterogeneous
oxidation of phenol using (Al-Cu) pillared clays as catalyst ( Barrault et al., 1998 ). The bib-
liometric analysis of these keywords in Scopus database has been provided in Fig. 12.1
showing that the number of publications on heterogeneous fenton and CWPO processes is
increasing exponentially. Textile dyes and phenolic compounds are among the organic
pollutants that have been targeted in these studies as they are normally nonbiodegradable
and resistant towards oxidation ( Emami et al., 2010b; Stuber et al., 2005 ).
The CWPO/heterogeneous Fenton process using water-insoluble solid catalysts started
to emerge as a promising approach to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of the
homogeneous Fenton process ( Fig. 12.2 ). The main goal in the CWPO process for wastewa-
ter treatment is to develop an AOP with superior oxidation efficiency in a wide range of
pH without leaching iron/other metals and producing sludge ( Wang et al., 2016 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTare as efficient as Fe21salt in the homogeneous Fenton process, (2) are very stable with no
or minimum metal leaching, (3) have large surface area and abundant catalytic sites, and
(4) are active at a wide range of pH and low temperatures ( Galeano et al., 2014; Munoz
et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2016b ).
The CWPO process has already been used for treatment of nonbiodegradable pollutants
found in various industrial wastewater with promising results. Many different solid
catalysts have been synthesized to replace the soluble iron salt in the conventional homo-
geneous Fenton system ( Catrinescu et al., 2012; Garrido-Ramirez et al., 2010 ). Using an
iron-bearing solid catalyst can limit the continuous leaching of catalyst that occurs in a
homogeneous system. The recovery and reuse of the iron-containing solid catalyst is much
easier than soluble iron salt at the end of the reaction ( Centi and Perathoner, 2008; Caudo
et al., 2006 ).
As for the pH regulation, the heterogeneous solid catalyst can facilitate the AOP over a
broad range of pH ( Caudo et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2008 ). This advantage can be attrib-
uted to the immobilization of the Fe21/Fe31ions inside the structure and within the pores
of the solid catalyst that prevents the precipitation of iron hydroxide ( Catrinescu et al.,
2003; Chen and Zhu, 2006 ). Moreover, some of the catalysts have an adsorption capacity
that can contribute to the contaminant removal ( Shahbazi et al., 2014 ).
Compared to simple chemical or biological process, the CWPO process has a high oper-
ating cost. In order to reduce the operating cost of the treatment, the utilization of CWPO
as a pre-treatment step for achieving enhanced biodegradability of wastewater that con-
tains recalcitrant compounds is an appealing method, if further biological processes can
easily degrade the produced intermediates.
12.2 CATALYSTS FOR CWPO
The main reason for using catalysts in CWPO is to accelerate the rate of hydroxyl radi-
cal generation and increase the rate of pollutant degradation. Currently, research works
are focused on developing catalysts with high stability and activity. A large number of cat-
alysts with various structures (supported, nonsupported, multimetallic, etc.) have already
been synthesized and tested ( He et al., 2016; Herney-Ramirez et al., 2010; Nidheesh, 2015 ).

for oxidation of organic pollutants.377 12.2 CATALYSTS FOR CWPO
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcatalysts are shown in Fig. 12.3 . The Fe21/Fe31ions may leach into the solution under
acidic condition, which contributes to oxidation via homogeneous Fenton process. This is
of course an unfavorable side reaction in the heterogeneous CWPO process, which reduces
the activity of the catalyst.
Majority of the catalysts synthesized for the Fenton and CWPO processes are based on
iron salts. However, other transition metal cations such as Cu21,M n21, and Co21can also
be used for this purpose ( Gokulakrishnan et al., 2009 ). Various supporting materials have
also been used for preparation of these catalysts. ( Table 12.1 ).
12.2.1 Nonsupported Metal Based Catalysts
12.2.1.1 Zero Valent Iron (Fe0)
Fe0is commonly used as a reducing agent and exhibits a dual surface property in
which the core is covered with iron and the shell with iron oxides ( Fig. 12.3 ). The reaction
of Fe0with H 2O2in an acidic condition generates Fe21ions (i.e., leaching). The released
ferrous ions undergo further Fenton reaction and produce hydroxyl radicals in the system.
A layer of iron oxide (mainly γ-FeOOH and Fe 3O4) is generally formed at the surface of
Fe0with relatively lower catalytic activity. Although Fe0is considered to be an accessible,
efficient, and cheap catalyst for CWPO, the high rate of leaching Fe21ions into the solu-
tion and low surface activity are certainly two drawbacks for this type of catalyst
(He et al., 2016; Nidheesh, 2015 ).
12.2.1.2 Iron Minerals
Iron minerals (e.g., FeO, α-Fe2O3,β-Fe2O3,F e 3O4,α-FeOOH, β-FeOOH, etc.) can also be
used as catalyst without any support for the CWPO process. The crystalline structure and
composition of Fe0,F e21,F e31at the surface of the iron oxides determine their catalytic
activity ( Hou et al., 2014 ). Fe21at the surface of catalysts is crucial for hydroxyl radical
generation ( Fig. 12.2 ). Therefore, the smaller particles with larger surface area will enhance
the catalytic oxidation due to the presence of more available Fe21sites ( Xu and Wang,
2012). As an example, the crystalline structure of Fe 3O4has been provided in Fig. 12.4
(Friak et al., 2007 ). Fe 3O4is one of the iron oxides that has both Fe21and Fe31in octahedral

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTsites. The leaching and catalytic activity of Fe 3O4is lower than those of Fe0for the CWPO
(Costa et al., 2008 ;He et al., 2016 ;Hou et al., 2014 ).
12.2.1.3 Supported or Nonsupported Mixed Metal Oxides
The incorporation of a second metal can increase the stability and catalytic activity of
the catalyst ( Chen et al., 2011; Lien and Zhang, 2001; Su et al., 2011 ). As an example, the
CWPO of methylene blue (0.1 g/L) in the presence of two mixed metal oxides (i.e.,
Fe2.47Mn 0.53O4and Fe 2.25Co0.75O4) is extremely faster than its degradation in the presence
of Fe 3O4(Costa et al., 2003 ). The discoloration of the solution within 10 min was achieved
in the presence of two mixed metal oxides, while the discoloration in the presence of
Fe3O4was less than 10% after 50 min ( Costa et al., 2006 ). Mixed metal oxides of Cu, Co,
Ni, and Fe, and Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, and Ir have also been reported as effective catalysts for
wastewater purification ( Levec and Pintar, 1995 ).
The catalytic degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous streams by mixed Al/M-pil-
lared clays (M 5Fe, Cu, Mn) has been reviewed ( Galeano et al., 2014 ). The incorporation
of bimetallic iron and nickel nanoparticles on chitosan as a stabilizer was effectively used
for the removal of the mixed amoxicillin and cadmium from the aqueous solution ( Weng
et al., 2013 ). Similarly, polyethyleneimine-decorated graphene oxide supported Fe-Ni dem-
onstrated an excellent dehydrogenation ( Zhou et al., 2012 ).
12.2.2 Supported Metal Based Catalysts
12.2.2.1 Clay-Based Material as Support
12.2.2.1.1 PILLARED INTERLAYERED CLAYS
Pillared interlayered clays (PILC) are inexpensive, highly porous solid materials exhibit-
ing remarkable characteristics and structures (e.g., high stability). PILC are prepared by
intercalating metal polycations and heated at elevated temperatures to form clusters of the
conforming metal oxide by dehydration and dehydroxylation. By upholding the silicate
layers apart, the formed metal oxides act as pillars, generating interlayer pores ( Pan et al.,
2008). Therefore, hydrogen peroxide can easily access the interlayer catalytic sites as a
result of the pillaring process ( Galeano et al., 2014; Sanabria et al., 2008 ). Various pillared
interlayered clays that contain Fe, Cu, Zn, etc. have been extensively utilized as heteroge-
neous catalysts in the CWPO process ( Basoglu and Balci, 2016; Cardona and Ocampo,
2016; Li et al., 2016; Mnasri-Ghnimi and Frini-Srasra, 2016; Tomul et al., 2016; Tomul, 2016;
Ye et al., 2016a, 2016b; Zhou et al., 2014 ).
The pillaring process generally increases the stability of clay and the resulting catalyst
shows significantly reduced metal leaching to the treated water ( Caudo et al., 2008;
Ramirez et al., 2007 ). Fe-PILC and Cu-PILC are among the most effective clay-supported
catalysts and their metal leaching to the solution is almost zero ( Table 12.2 ). Thus, these
catalysts can be recovered and reused several times without noticeable loss of activity. Fe-
PILCs are effective over a wider range of pH with acceptable catalytic activity at near neu-
tral pH with a short substantial activity loss ( Galeano et al., 2014 ). This advantage is due
to the significant immobilization of Fe31species in the interlayer space of the pillared clay;380 12. CATALYTIC WET PEROXIDE OXIDATION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTthus, significantly reducing the effect of alteration in solution pH as a result of stabilizing
the iron inside the PILC and limiting leaching.
12.2.2.1.2 ALUMINA
Alumina (Al 2O3) possesses a strong alkalinity, broad range of surface area, and
notable ion exchange abilities ( Soon and Hameed, 2011 ). Alumina has been used as a sup-
port for both iron and iron oxides for the degradation of numerous organic compounds.
The degradation of 2,4-dinitrophenol with CWPO processes using alumina-supported
Fe31and nonsupported ferric sulfate at the same temperature and pH has been studied by
Ghosh et al. (2012) . The CWPO in the presence of the alumina-supported ferric ions seems
to be slightly improved ( Fig. 12.5 ). The supported catalyst was recovered and reused four
times with about 20% of loss in activity due to iron leaching. It was reported that the
amount of the alumina-supported ferric catalyst needed for the CWPO process is eight
times higher than that of the nonsupported Fe31(Ghosh et al., 2012 ). Alumina based cata-
lysts normally have a high level of metal leaching compared with pillared-based catalysts
(Caudo et al., 2007 ).
12.2.2.1.3 ZEOLITE
Zeolite belongs to the aluminosilicate family of microporous crystalline materials that
can accommodate a wide range of cations such as Na1,K1,C a21,M g21. SiO 4and AlO 4,
the two main constituents of zeolites, share an oxygen ion that forms a link between them
(Petranovskii et al., 2016 ). The integration of Al into a silica framework (AlO 4) makes the
framework negatively charged, which can be balanced by extra inorganic or organic
cations. Ion exchange and impregnation are two methods that are generally used for intro-
ducing metals into zeolites ( Misaelides, 2011 ). Being highly porous materials, zeolites have
been widely used as support material for several catalysts. These catalysts are considered
cost effective, vastly available, and recyclable. They can function at nearly neutral pH, and
remove pollutants by both adsorption and oxidation ( Franus et al., 2015 ;Hedstrom, 2001 ;
Zhao, 2016 ). The porous structure of zeolites and alterations on the surface imposeTABLE 12.2 The CWPO of p-Coumaric Acid Using Different Supported Catalysts

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcomplex sorption mechanisms. ZSM-5 as a typical microporous zeolite has a 10-ring inter-
connected channel system with a high Si/Al ratio ( Yaripour et al., 2015 ). The specific sur-
face area of ZSM-5 can be as high as 370 m2/g (Table 12.2 ), which may influence the mass
transfer efficiency. MCM-41, another member of mesoporous zeolites, possesses a hexago-
nally arranged uniformed pore structure ( Wu et al., 2001 ). High specific surface area
(more than 800 m2/g), large pore volume, and uniform pore size makes MCM-41 a good
candidate for catalyst support, or adsorbent in the CWPO process ( Kumar et al., 2001;
Timofeeva et al., 2007 ).
12.2.2.2 Carbon-Based Materials as Support
There are many scientific publications on carbon-based catalysts in liquid or in gas
phase reactions ( Figueiredo, 2013 ). Porous carbon materials can be used as supports for
immobilization of metal complexes at their surface and the resulting catalysts have many
interesting characteristics as follows: (1) They are stable at high temperatures and in a
wider range of pH, (2) they have normally high specific surface area and porosity, (3) their
surface can be modified chemically in order to enhance the diffusion of species across the
surface and control the dispersion of metals, (4) they can be separated from the solution
and burned to recover the costly metal phase, (5) they are relatively cheap, and (6) they
can be used as adsorbents ( Figueiredo, 2013; Herney-Ramirez and Madeira, 2010; Philippe
et al., 2009; Rodriguez-Reinoso, 1998; Serp and Figueiredo, 2009 ).

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTThe most widely used technique for the preparation of carbon-supported metal catalysts
is impregnation ( Figueiredo, 2013 ). Nonetheless, numerous additional methods have been
used to prepare carbonaceous supports, for instance, precipitation or co-precipitation,
liquid-phase reduction, chemical vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition ( Serp and
Figueiredo, 2009 ). Due to their remarkable characteristics and a wide range of preparation
methods, the utilization of the carbon-supported catalysts is an appealing solution to over-
come the shortcomings stated earlier on the utilization of homogeneous Fenton process.
12.2.2.2.1 ACTIVATED CARBON (AC)
AC is a porous material exhibiting amphoteric characteristics, and is usually used for
adsorption of organic and inorganic compounds. There are some remarkable advantages
of activated carbon such as, reduced operation cost, high surface area, significant stability,
and tunability of the surface and structure ( Britto et al., 2008; Martinez et al., 2014 ). AC
supported catalysts can be found in two different forms (i.e., powdered and granular).
The adsorption capacity of these supports is substantially affected by the nature of the
carbon sorbent and the preparation methods. The CWPO process using AC supported cat-
alysts is quite favorable compared with the conventional homogeneous Fenton process
(Buthiyappan et al., 2016 ).
AC supported catalysts can be simply prepared by incipient impregnation of various types
of AC in iron salt solution, followed by drying and heat treatment at 200/C14C. Complete phenol
conversion and 80% mineralization can be achieved in less than 2 h using the CWPO process
in the presence of these supported catalysts ( Rey et al., 2009 ). However, the iron leaching can
be very high (between 20% and 60%), which affects the reusability of the catalysts. However,
there are some papers showing that the iron leaching of the AC supported catalysts is rela-
tively low without providing any proof for their reusability ( Messele et al., 2015 ).
The high conversion and TOC removal (%) of organic pollutants in many of the CWPO
studies are directly related to the high adsorption capacity of AC ( Ribeiro et al., 2012; Ribeiro
et al., 2016a ). Therefore, the loss of activity after each cycle of recovery and reuse is observed.
12.2.2.2.2 MULTIWALLED CARBON NANOTUBES (MWCNTS)
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have remarkable characteristics such as enhanced mass-
transfer efficiency, increased ordering and mechanical resistance, excellent electronic char-
acteristics, and increased thermal stability in oxidizing conditions. For preparation of the
supported catalyst, CNTs are mainly synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of a
hydrocarbon gas on the surface of catalysts ( Kumar and Ando, 2010 ). A synthesized
hybrid (Fe 3O4/MWCNT) was used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the CWPO process. The
supported catalyst showed superior performance than that of the nonsupported magnetite
(Fe3O4) for the degradation of methyltestosterone. Fe 3O4/MWCNT showed an enhanced
removal rate of pollutant (86%) compared to that of Fe 3O4(62%) at 20/C14C and pH 5. This is
attributed to the adsorption of the pollutant at the surface of catalyst and near the active
catalytic sites. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was also reduced in the presence
of this catalyst, indicating an enhanced hydrogen peroxide consumption efficiency
(Hu et al., 2011 ). Ferrocene groups immobilized on aluminum-silicate and MWCNTs (Si/
Al@Fe/MWCNT) were utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst for the CWPO process. The
synthesized material showed a remarkable efficiency in the removal of methyl orange dye383 12.2 CATALYSTS FOR CWPO
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT(100% removal after 6 min) by both adsorption and CWPO processes. The catalyst was
successfully recovered and reused six times without any noticeable loss of activity in the
CWPO process ( Arshadi et al., 2016 ) while the material shows a huge loss of activity as an
adsorbent in the absence of hydrogen peroxide.
12.2.2.2.3 GRAPHENE-BASED MATERIALS
Graphene oxide (GO) has also been used as a support for Fe 3O4magnetic nanoparticles
by the co-precipitation synthesis method followed by reduction with hydrazine to produce
the catalyst Fe 3O4/rGO (reduced graphene oxide). Under the same conditions, the CWPO of
4-chlorophenol in the presence of Fe 3O4/rGO was much more efficient (98.6% removal) than
those in the presence of Fe 3O4(17.7% removal) or GO (24.5% removal). These magnetic nano-
composites can be separated by a magnetic field, washed, and reused after each process
(Liu et al., 2013 ). The reduced graphene oxide was impregnated by Fe 3O4/C0Mn 3O4nanoparti-
cles to produce the supported catalyst. The CWPO efficiency for sulfamethazine degradation
using Fe 3O4/C0Mn 3O4-rGO was remarkably higher than those of Fe 3O4/C0Mn 3O4and Mn 3O4
under the same optimal conditions: [Catalyst] 50.5 g/L, [H 2O2]56m Ma t3 5/C14C, pH 3 ( Wan
and Wang, 2017 ).
12.2.2.3 Organic-Based Materials as Support
In one of the few studies using polymers as the support of catalyst, Cu21species were
adsorbed on the surface of poly(4-vinylpyridine) and the resulting composite was used as
a catalyst for the degradation of 1 g/L of phenol in water. The conversion rate was rela-
tively low (60%) after 120 min at 50/C14C and pH 6. The catalyst preserved its integrity
during the reaction, and the leaching of Cu was above 7 mg/L for this process ( Castro
et al., 2013 ). The drawback of using a polymeric support is its in stability in the CWPO
process. Hydroxyl radicals attack the polymeric support and degrade its structure
gradually.
12.3 EFFICIENCY OF CWPO OF PHENOL
To compare the efficiency and performance of various heterogeneous catalysts in the
CWPO process, the degradation of phenol (as an organic pollutant) in water has been
summarized in Table 12.3 .
The high availability and reduced cost of magnetic natural minerals make them
appealing for the CPWO application. Exceptional H 2O2consumption efficiency was
reported for the CWPO process using naturally occurring iron minerals (i.e., magnetite,
hematite, and ilmenite) compared with that of homogeneous Fenton oxidation under
similar operating conditions ( Zazo et al., 2011 ). However, their reusability is limited due
to their high iron leaching and generation of iron sludge, which imposes a treatment
after their use; thus, increasing the cost of operation ( Munoz et al., 2017 ).
The catalytic performance of magnetic nanoparticles is not noticeably better than that of
natural magnetic minerals. A high concentration of nanoparticles and H 2O2is normally
needed for the CWPO process. Much better catalysts with reduced manufacturing cost,384 12. CATALYTIC WET PEROXIDE OXIDATION

(Munoz et al., 2015 ).
The supported materials having higher surface area, larger pore volume, and uniform
pore size normally enhance the performance of the CWPO process. The catalytic
performance of Fe 2O3/ZSM-5 ( Yan et al., 2015 ) and Fe 2O3/MCM-41 ( Yan et al., 2016 )
under the same conditions can be compared.
A high level of iron leaching from the supported/nonsupported catalysts contributes to
the oxidation of the pollutants via the Fenton process. This leads to the deactivation of the
catalyst due to complexation and reduces its recyclability ( Inchaurrondo et al., 2017;
Andas et al., 2014; Pinho et al., 2015 ). The minimum level of iron leaching has been
reported for the pillared clay supported catalyst as of 0% ( Catrinescu et al., 2003 )a n d
many of the catalysts based on MWCNT, alumina, and silica as supports have a very high
level of iron leaching indeed ( Andas et al., 2014; Di Luca et al., 2014; Pinho et al., 2015 ).
Metal leaching from catalysts normally increases at higher temperatures ( Zhou et al.,
2011). High-temperature calcination of the catalysts after impregnation with various
salts and addition of some additives (e.g., oxalic acid) improves the stability of the clay
based catalysts ( Di Luca et al., 2014 ).
A remarkable performance in the mineralization of phenol in water ( B75%) at a wide
range of pH and using moderate amounts of oxidant has been reported for Fe 2O3/SBA-
15 nanocomposites. 75% of the stoichiometric amount required for the complete
mineralization of the initial phenol concentration was used (3.8 g/L), which is fairly
low. Another advantage was that the reaction medium was not acidified at the end of
the process, which can reduce the operation costs since the neutralization process is not
needed anymore. However, this CWPO process has been performed at a high
temperature of 100/C14C, which is quite energy intensive ( Melero et al., 2007 ).
Some of the supporting materials for catalysts are very good adsorbents (e.g., AC,
MWCNTs). Thus, a very high level of pollutant removal can be achieved due to
adsorption and the CWPO ( Messele et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2015; Variava et al., 2012 ).
Both Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 particle catalysts were used for the CWPO of phenol in a
fixed bed reactor. 95% phenol removal and 80% H 2O2conversion were achieved in the
CWPO. The Cu-ZSM-5 membrane catalyst showed better catalytic activity because no
quinone compounds were detected in the treated wastewater. As for the stability, an
increased Cu leaching concentration was reported 0.20 g/L (15% leached Cu) ( Jiang
et al., 2015 ).
12.4 EFFECT OF THE MAIN PARAMETERS
12.4.1 Effect of Initial pH
The pH of solution is a very important parameter and it has a direct effect on both the
catalytic performance and the degree of iron leaching from the support. The latter deter-
mines the overall stability of the utilized catalyst, which is an important factor in the recycla-
bility of the catalyst. The CWPO process showed its best performance at pH 2 /C04, which is a
representative pH value for the conventional homogeneous Fenton process ( Molina et al.,388 12. CATALYTIC WET PEROXIDE OXIDATION
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT2006). However, the CWPO process using solid catalyst (e.g., magnetic copper ferrite nano-
particles) has a wider range of working pH and the catalyst is still active at pH 8 and even
10 (Tehrani-Bagha et al., 2016 ). The effect of initial pH on the performance of iron oxide sup-
ported catalyst for the m-cresol conversion, TOC removal, and iron leaching has been shown
inFig. 12.6 . The degradation and TOC removal (%) were more or less constant, when the ini-
tial pH was varied from 2 to 6. The m-cresol conversion (%) and TOC removal (%) noticeably
decreased at pH above 6 ( Liu et al., 2015 ). At pH 3, the highest concentration of active Fe21
species is achieved accompanied by the maximum scavenging effect of the hydroxyl radicals.
While at a pH value above 3, the insoluble FeOOH precipitates and decomposes significantly
(Pignatello, 1992 ), resulting in lower catalyst activity and lower metal leaching.
12.4.2 Effect of Temperature
The CWPO and mineralization of organic pollutants normally increases noticeably by
increasing the temperature from 25 to around 80/C14C(Fig. 12.7 ). This can be attributed to the
higher H 2O2conversion to hydroxyl radicals ( Di Luca et al., 2014; Martinez et al., 2014; Yan
et al., 2016 ). The CWPO of pollutant at a temperature as high as 100/C14Ch a sa l s ob e e n
reported in one case ( Melero et al., 2007 ). However, the CWPO process at elevated tempera-
tures (.40/C14C) will increase the total cost of the treatment and the thermal decomposition of
H2O2into oxygen and water (i.e., inactive species). The latter will reduce the concentration

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTof hydroxyl radicals in the solution and hence, more H 2O2is needed for the efficient oxida-
tion ( Herney-Ramirez et al., 2010 ).
12.4.3 Effect of H 2O2Dosage
In the CWPO process, the concentration of oxidant (H 2O2) is a vital factor that consider-
ably affects the removal of organic pollutants. The amount of generated hydroxyl radicals
is related directly to the concentration of H 2O2. The TOC removal efficiency of phenol in
water using a commercial catalyst (BASF Cu-0226S) has been presented in Table 12.4
(Inchaurrondo et al., 2012a ). The final TOC removal (%) increases by increasing the
amount of H 2O2in the solution. However, the most efficient CWPO process (i.e., high rate
of TOC removal at minimum concentration of H 2O2) can be determined by comparing the
efficiency of H 2O2consumption provided in this table. Excess hydrogen peroxide in the
solution will increase the chance for recombination of the radicals (i.e., scavenging effect)
and production of less active radicals such as HO/C15
2in the solution. H 2O2can also react
with the active hydroxyl radicals in the solution to generate inactive species (e.g., H 2O and
O2). Therefore, the efficiency factor (TOC consumption over H 2O2consumption) should be
calculated for different CWPO processes to determine the most efficient conditions
(Inchaurrondo et al., 2012b; Inchaurrondo et al., 2012a ).
12.4.4 Effect of the Catalyst Load
The number of accessible active sites on th e surface of catalysts is directly pro-
portional to the concentration of the cata lyst in the solution. Hence, an increased
FIGURE 12.7 CWPO of 2,4-dichlorophenol (0.25 g/L) using Ce 0.5Fe0.5O2(0.5 g/L) nanocatalyst and H 2O2

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcatalyst load normally enhances the catalyt ic performance and accelerates the reac-
tion rate ( Inchaurrondo et al., 2012a; Inchaurrondo et al., 2017; Kurian et al., 2017 ).
When a high concentration of catalyst (25 g/L) was used, the mineralization of the
pollutant increased between 10 and 40% under the same condition ( Table 12.4 ). For
reducing the cost of the CWPO process and reducing the iron leaching, the concen-
tration of the catalyst in the solution should be optimized as it was described ear-
lier. The minimum concentration of the catalyst that is needed for the degradation
of organic pollutants with stoichiometric amount of H 2O2in a reasonable time is
normally reported as the optimized concentration of the catalyst ( Liu et al., 2015;
Wang et al., 2015 ).
The results also show that by increasing the catalyst concentration beyond a certain
value, the performance of the CWPO process is also adversely affected ( Zhou et al., 2011 )
(Fig. 12.8 ). This can be explained by the higher rate of H 2O2decomposition and the subse-
quent formation of less active radicals or inactive species (water, O 2), which are less effec-
tive in oxidation of the pollutant.TABLE 12.4 The Effect of H 2O2Dosage on TOC Removal and H 2O2Consumption Efficiencies for Phenol

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT12.5 CWPO PERFORMANCE
To compare the efficiency and performance of the CWPO process with other AOPs, the
degradations of two persistent organic pollutants (i.e., phenol and C.I. reactive red 120) in
water have been summarized in Tables 12.5 and 12.6 , respectively. There are a number of
effective parameters on degradation of the organic pollutants by AOPs that have already
been explained and discussed earlier. The reported conditions in these tables may not nec-
essarily represent the optimum conditions of the degradation by the specified AOP due to
incomplete optimization used in those references.
The results of these tables can be summarized as follows:
AOPs are generally quite fast and efficient in the degradation of organic pollutants in
water. Complete phenol removal in 0.5 h and complete mineralization (i.e., 100% TOC
removal) in about 2 h has already been reported for UV 1H2O2process under a very
strong UV radiation ( Olmez-Hanci and Arslan-Alaton, 2013 ).
The efficiency of AOPs in the degradation of organic pollutants increases by addition of
catalyst dosage, H 2O2concentration, UV irradiation power, ozonation dosage, and
sonication power to a large extent. There is generally a strong synergy between the
aforementioned parameters. The combination of various oxidants (UV, O 3,H2O2, etc.)
and addition of catalysts normally enhance the efficiency of the AOPs.
Fenton and CWPO processes are both temperature dependent and the degradation rate
of organic pollutants normally increases by increasing the temperature ( Emami et al.,
2010a, 2010b; Tehrani-Bagha et al., 2016 ).
The CWPO process using various water insoluble catalysts is considered a fast and
efficient AOP. Depending on the efficiency of the synthesized catalysts, the process can
generate similar results as that of homogeneous Fenton process using ferrous sulfate as

(Continued )393 12.5 CWPO PERFORMANCE
ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTcatalyst. However, the CWPO process normally needs a slightly higher concentration of
H2O2and higher temperature to show their best performance ( Huang et al., 2015a;
Huang et al., 2015b; Rubalcaba et al., 2007 ). The catalytic activity of both of these AOPs
decreases noticeably at pH .5 due to lower rate of radical formation at the surface of
catalysts. Nevertheless, very efficient pollutant degradation can be still observed at pH
5/C08 for the CWPO process, which is not the case for the Fenton process ( Emami et al.,
2010a; Emami et al., 2010b; Tehrani-Bagha et al., 2016 ).
Unlike many of noncatalytic AOPs (O 31H2O2,U V1H2O2, etc.), the CWPO method
needs a noticeable amount of catalyst in the solution for wastewater treatment. The
recovery and reuse of the remaining catalyst is still a big challenge. A conventional
filtration and regeneration of the catalyst can be quite difficult and expensive in a large
scale treatment. For solving this issue, a catalytic fixed bed reactor ( Ferentz et al., 2015;
Nadejde et al., 2016; Ribeiro et al., 2016a, 2017; Yan et al., 2016 ) or magnetic catalyst
particles ( Tehrani-Bagha et al., 2016 ) can be used.
In comparison with many conventional wast ewater treatments (e.g., biological,
coagulation/flocculation, etc.), AOPs a re considered to be energy intensive and
expensive. AOPs based on UV irradiation, sonication, and ozonation need special
equipment and consume electricity ( Chatzisymeon et al., 2013; Esplugas et al., 2002 ).
In terms of degradation efficiency and e nergy requirements, the Fenton and CWPO
processes are superior to UV based AOPs. However, the price of catalyst and H 2O2
are relatively high, which affects the total cost of the treatment. Besides, the catalystsTABLE 12.5 (Continued)

ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENTIt should be noted that ozonation in alkaline conditions has been considered to be more
cost effective than the Fenton process by some other researchers ( Louhichi and Bensalah,
2014; Esplugas et al., 2002 ). The cost calculations on these references were only approxi-
mate and a more thorough economic analysis should be performed by considering the ini-
tial investment requirement, the price of chemicals in a large scale, maintenance, and labor
costs.
Compared with homogeneous Fenton process, the CWPO process using solid catalysts
shows numerous advantages (e.g., reusability of catalyst, enhanced catalytic activity in a
wider range of pH, low rate of metal leaching and sludge production, etc.). However,
some of the solid catalysts still have a high rate of metal leaching that will affect their
activity and reusability. An additional issue for the CWPO process is the deactivation of
the solid catalysts due to poisoning, fouling, thermal degradation, mechanical damage,
and leaching by the reaction mixture ( Bartholomew, 2001 ). Some of the used catalysts,
especially the supported ones, have high adsorption capabilities that contribute to the final
removal of pollutant from the solution. The adsorption of impurities at the surface of these
catalyst can block their pores and eventually deactivate them ( Pinho et al., 2015;
Bartholomew, 2001 ).
Complete mineralization of organic pollutants in aqueous solution is achievable by the
CWPO process. However, the preparation of a solid catalyst with high surface area and a
large number of active sites will add to the total cost of wastewater treatment. Therefore,
the utilization of this process depends on the development of solid catalysts with high effi-
ciency, stability, reusability, and low price in a large scale treatment plant.
