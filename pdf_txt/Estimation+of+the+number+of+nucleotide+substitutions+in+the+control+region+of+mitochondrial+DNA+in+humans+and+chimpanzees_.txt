Appendix Figure. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Thelazia callipaeda cox1 gene by maximum 
likelihood method based on the Tamura- Nei model ( 1) conducted on 2, 000 bootstrap repl ications. The 
tree with the highest log likelihood ( -2128.91) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated 
taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained 
automatically by applying Neighbor -Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated 
using the maximum composite likelihood (MCL) approach, then selecting the topology with superior log 
likelihood values . A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionar y rate differences among 
sites (5 categories [+G, parameter = 0.2595] ). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured

included were 1st+2nd+3 rd+Noncoding. The representative sequence from this study is in bold. 
Dracunculus medinensis sequence was used as outgroup. Evolutionary analyses were conducted using 
MEGA7 software.
