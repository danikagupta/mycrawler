Abstract  : The textile industries were producing a massive quantity of highly contaminated 
effluents. The emancipation of those effluents without a suitable treatment is an issue of 
severe concern due to their lethal impacts on receiving waters. The conventional tech nologies 
used for the wastewater treatment are inept or pricey in the treatment of textile effluents. The 
present research paper helps to identify new technologies to replace or to complement the 
accessible ones by the microbial decolorization of dye indus try effluent by three wood -rot 
fungi.  Three different wood rot fungi, Daldenia  concentrica, Lepiota sp. And Trametes  
serialis  were collected from the Western Ghats region of Tamil Nadu, India. The fungi were 
used to degrade the azo  dyes such as orange G, methyl orange and congo red from aqueous 
solutions was determined by estimating the per cent of dye removal and the effect of dye 
concentration. The dye industry effluents were decolorized by ligninolytic fungi in batch mode 
and con tinuous flow mode.  The results exhibit the colour removal by the basidiomycetes fungi 
were mainly due to adsorption of the dyes to the mycelial surface and due to metabolic 
breakdown. These results showed that Lepiota sp.  was found to be the most effective fungus in 
decolourization of azo dyes especially orange G;  Daldenia  concentrica  could be used for 
decolourization of methyl orange and Trametes  serialis  could be used for congo red for dye 
removal. Trametes  serialis for batch mode and  Lepiota sp. for continuous mo de could be 
recommended . 
Keywords  : Azo dyes, Decolourization, Daldenia  concentrica, Lepiota sp., Trametes  serialis . 
 
Introduction  
Wood rot fungi can degradelignin and can arrange environmental pollutants by many of their 
extracellular ligninolytic enzymes1.Dye is an integral part which is used to impart colour to materials. The waste 
generated during the process and operation of the dyes, contains the inorganic and organic contaminant leading 
to the hazard to ecosystem and biodiversity causing impact on the environment. The physico -chemical 
treatment does not remove the colour and dye compound concentration. The decolourization of the dye takes 
place either by adsorption on the microbial biomass and enzymatic degradation.Bioremediation takes place by 
anaerobi c and aerobic process2. 
Dyes are chemical which bind to material and impart colour to that material. The colour of a dye is due 
to the presence of chromophore group. They are widely used  to colour the substrate like textile fiber, paper, 
leather and hair,  for plastic material, wax a cosmetic base and food stuff 3.. Based on chemical structure of 
chromophore there are 20 - 30 different groups of dyes. Azo (Monoazo, diazo, triazo, polyazo) anthraquinone, 
phthalocyanine and triarylmethane dyes are the most im portant groups 4. The majority of industrial important 
azo dyes belong to the following classes like acid dyes, basic dyes, direct dyes, mordant dyes, reactive dyes and

solvent dyes. The acid dyes, direct and reactive azo dyes are ionic dyes 5.  
Azo dyes are the largest groups of synthetic aromatic dyes composed with one or more (N=N) groups 
and sulfonic ( -SO 3-) groups with lots of commericial interest. Azo dyes contain one, two or three azo linkages, 
linking phenyl, naphthyl rings that are usually s ubstituted with some functional groups including triazine amine, 
chloro, hydroxyl, methyl, nitro and sulphonate6. There are more than 10000 azo dyes which  include Astrazon 
Red GTLN; Maxilon Blue GRL and sandolan yellow are widely used by the textiles, leath er, cosmetics, food 
colouring and paper production industries7-8. About 80% of azo dyes are used in the dyeing process of textile 
industries and has been estimated approximately 10% of the dyes used in dying process do not bind to the fiber 
and are release d into the environment 9. 
The textile industry effluents are the great threat of the environment.Textile waste waters include 
various dyes which are hardly decolourized by conventional treatment system.Generally, these effluents are 
highly coloured with hi gh biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Dye 
decolourization through biological means has gained force of the cost effective and can be applied to wide 
range of dyes10. 
Materials and Methods  
Collection of fungi  
Thefungi Daldenia  concentrica , Lepiota sp.  and Trametes  serialis  were collected from decayed wood 
of Western Ghats area of Tamilnadu and Karnataka,  south India. The collection site was situated in the latitude 
of 11.58°S and longitude of 76.93°E at 420 ± 50M MSL. It r eceives rain fall of about 300 cm per year with high 
humidity and even temperature.The collected fungi were isolated and identified based on the key 
providedpreviously11-12. The collected fungi were identified and screened for further studies.  
Preparation  of Inoculum  
The wood rot fungi were isolated and maintained on 2% malt agar medium. Fungal growth was cut out, 
sterilized with 1% mercuric chloride solution and continuously washed by sterile distilled water then incubated 
on 2% malt agar plates (2 g of malt extract, 2 g of agar in 100 ml distilled water )13. The spore suspension 
obtained from the malt agar plates were used a s inoculums for further studies.  
Preparation of spore suspension  
The fungi were grown in malt agar medium. The pH was maintained as 6 .5 at 37°C then the plates were 
flooded with sterile distilled water and brushed with camel hair brush smoothly without disturbing the mycelial 
growth and filtered through a sterile filter. The concentration of the filtrate was adjusted to 105spores/ml and  
inoculum was used for further studies. Dye decolorization studies was carried out in C -limited medium (M 14) 
the spores were in the one -tenth volume of the medium were inoculated 14. 
Screening of wood rot fungi for ligninolytic activity  
The wood rot fungi  were screened for their ligninolytic activity based on their ability to oxidize dyes, 
Poly R 15 and remazol brilliant blu e. The fungi were also tested for their ability to degrade native lignin 16and 
confirmation was done by the liberation of ethylene fro m 2-keto-4- thiomethylbutyric acid (KTBA).  
Decolourization of azo dyes  
The ability of the fungi to decolourize the azo dyes, orange G (50 µM), methyl orange (50 µM) and 
congo red (50 µM) were studied in C -limited medium. The medium was inoculated with fung al spore 
suspension (105spores/ml) and incubated at 30°C for 6 days in an orbital shaker. After 6 days, the dyesorange G 
(50 µM), methyl orange (50 µM) and congo red (50 µM) were added. The samples were withdrawn at regular 
time intervals and filtered thro ugh a G3 sintered glass filter. The optical density of the clear filtrate was 
measured at 479, 497 and 620 nm respectively fororange G (50 µM), methyl orange (50 µM)and Congo red (50 
µM) in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, TCC 240).A control was also maintai ned. Selvam K  et al /International Journal of ChemTech Research , 2017,10(10): 515 -524. 517 
 
 
Decolourization of azo dyes by wood rot fungi  
The  enzymes were used  to degrade the  azo dyes such as orange G, methyl orange  and congo red from  
aqueous solution were determined by estimating the per cent of dye removal and the effect of dye 
concen tration.  
Decolourization of textile industry effluent  
 The ability of the wood rot fungi to remove colour from dyeing industry effluent was assayed in the 
modified C - limited medium, where instead of distilled water, the effluent amended medium (950 ml) w as taken 
in the rotating biological contractor and inoculated with 50 ml of spore suspension (10 5spore /ml ) and 
maintained at 39o C. The samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals and analysed for colour removal. 
The intensity of effluent colour wa s measured at 490 nm.

most effective than continuous mode.  
The maximum decolourization of azo dyes and mycelial growth of all the three test fungi were favoured  
at twelth day of incubation and Lepiota sp . efficiently removed orange G . In methyl orange, all the three wood 
rot fungi were favoured at 8thday of incubation . Daldenia c oncentrica  had efficiently removed  methyl orange. 
Trametes  serialis  (95.48 %)removed congo red efficiently . 
The dye industry effluents were treated for colour removal i n batch mode and continuous mode. In 
batch mode, the fungi take seven days for maximum removal of colour from the effluent.  Trametes  serialis  
removed  the maximum colour reduction upto 89.28 % on seventh day.  In continuous mode colo ur removal was 
showed maximum by  Lepiota sp. on seventh day of 55.95 % respectively.  
Lignin degrading wood rot fungi, Poria  sp. Ganoderma  sp. and Trametes  sp. were collected from the 
decayed white of Tectona  grandis  from the Western Ghats of Tamilnadu, India. The fungi were used for the 
decolourization of azo dyes such as congo red, rhodami ne 6G, malachite green17.Decolourization of dyes 
orange II and Black V by the fungi Pycnoporus  sanguineus  and Trametes  membranacea  was assessed at 6, 12 
and 18 days, through fractional design, with a total of 16 trials18. 
Aspergillu s orhraceus  could remove 100 % of reactive blue -25 within 7 days 19. Ganoderma austral and 
Pleurotus  ostreatus sp. 3 removed 93.4% and 66.25% of poly R -478 dye in 18 days respectively, where as  
Polyporus sp .2 removed the dye upto 86.53% in 18 days 20. Cunnighamella  elegans  was used for the  
decolourization of orange II dye and it removed 88% of azobased reactive group in 96hours 21. Fomes  lividus  
could remove 30.8% of Orange G, Congo red and Amino black 10B removed 74.0 and 98.9% respectively. In 
Batch mode maximum decolorization was achieved of 84.4% on 4th day whereas in continuous mode the 
decolorization was 37.5% on 5th day 22. The decolourization of congo red, fast blue RR salt, methyl violet in six 
days 23. Pleurotus  sp were decolourize orange G and remazol brilliant blue R after 12 -18 days  24. Armillaria sp .

100% of yellow GAD within 144hours26. Coriolus  versicolor  degraded 85% of Acid orange II 27. Thus the 
microbial decolorization  of these novel fungi showed potential control over industrial effluents and other 
compounds.  
Conclusion  
 The wood rot fungi symbolize an eco -friendly and fewer pricey and being unconventional for the 
treatment of such effluents. The results justify the a pplicability of the wood rot fungi in removal of azodyes 
from textile wastewaters and their safe disposal. The textile industry is a significant user of water and produces 
enormous volumes of impurewater the vital contaminants in noxious wastes are azo dyes . Microbial 
decolorizationprocesses for the waste water management oftextile wastewater have the benefit of being cost -
effective and eco -friendly and producinglesser sludge.  
From the present study it could be concluded, that the three wood rot fungi namel y Daldenia  
concentrica, Lepiota sp. And Trametes  serialis  possess ligninolytic activity. These wood rot fungi could be 
employed for treating the textil e industry waste water . Lepiota sp. could be used for treating dye like orange 
G;Daldenia  concentrica  could be u sed for methyl orange and Trametes  serialis  could be us ed for congo 
red.Trametes  serialis  for batch mode and Lepiota sp . for continuous mode could be recommended.
