Abstract  
Azo dyes are widely used colourants owing to their array of possible colours and general 
recalcitrance to microbial degradation owing to their toxicity. This study aimed to isolate azo 
dyes degrading bacteria from soil; treat methyl red and crystal violet dyes using the isolates, and 
assess the phytotoxicity of the treated and untreated dyes on sorghum. Ten bacteria were 
isolated from the soil, of which two were identified as efficient azo dyes degrading bacteria by 
efficiency in dye decolouration. The isol ates were identified as Escherichia coli  and Bacillus 
subtilis  based on their biochemical characteristics. The isolates were able to degrade methyl 
orange dye by 16 -75 % and crystal violet by 16 -78%, depending on the concentration of the dye. 
The isolates were more efficient at degrading the dyes at a low concentrati on of 0.00025 mg/ml, 
as indicated by a higher percentage of decolourization (53 -79%). The percentage phytotoxicity 
of the untreated methyl red ranged from 33 -59%, while the toxicity of the untreated crystal 
violet ranged from 62 -91%. The toxicity of the tr eated methyl red ranged from 9 -34%, while the 
toxicity of the treated crystal violet ranged from 12 -32%.  The results revealed that the isolates 
were capable of degrading methyl red and crystal violet dyes, and could be useful in the 
bioremediation of azo d yes polluted soil.

Introduction  
Dyes are the coloured substances which fix firmly with the substrate. There are different types 
of dyes classified according to their structures and functions. Azo dyes are the largest group of 
dyes used in the industry, representing more than half of the annual production [1,2] . Azo dyes 
are the largest class of synthetic dyes with t he greatest variety of colours [3] . Different varietie s 
of azo dyes are in use today in the consumer goods industries because of the diversity of dye 
components available for the synthesis of a large number of structu rally different azo dyes [4,5] . 
Azo dyes are used by a wide number of industries because thes e compounds retain their colour 
and structural integrity under exposure to sunlight, soil, bacteria and sweat; they also exhibit 
high resistance to microbial degradation [6].  
There is a continual demand to develop longer -lasting, more applicable dyes for items such as 
synthetic fabrics [7,8] . Azo dyes are continually updated to produce colours that reflect the 
trends dictated by changing social ideas and styles. From an environmental standpoint, the 
expansion in the demand and application of azo dyes is a threat to the safety of life which is 
never going away unless alternatives are found or better ways to manage them are devised.  
While most azo dyes themselves are non -toxic a significantly larger po rtion of their metabolites 
are [6,9,10] . The potential for  toxic effects of exposure to dyes and dye metabolites is not a new 
concern. Some dyes are carcinogenic and genotoxic because of the toxic pot ential of many 
aromatic amines [5,11] . Although several soil microorganisms can degrade dyes, they are often 
limit ed by the production of toxic by -products or the presence of toxic dye additives and also 
high salt concentrations [12]. Thus, these dyes are likely to persist in the environment and 
become toxic to biota.   
 
 The treatment of dye effluents is of interest due  to their toxic and aesthetic impacts on receiving 
soil and water bodies. Effective and economic treatment of a diversity of effluents containing 
azo has become a problem. Currently, much research has been focused on chemically and 
physically degrading azo  dyes in wastewaters, such as chemical oxidation, UV oxidation, 
electrochemical or wet oxidation, activated carbon adsorption, reverse osmosi s, or 
coagulation/flocculation [2,13,14] . Many of these technologies are cost -prohibitive, however, 
and therefore a re not viable options for treating large waste streams.  
While much research has been performed to develop effective treatment technologies, no single 
solution has been satisfactory for remediating the diversity  of wastes from dye industries [15] . 
This is b ecause no single treatment system is adequate for degrading the diverse dye structures. 
However, the chemical structures of dyes can be modified by microbial metabolism  [16,17] .  
Dye substrates can serve as a source of carbon, energy and nitrogen for toler ant bacteria and 
fungi, as defined by their structural composition [3,18] . This makes the biodegradation of azo 
dyes a viable option for chemical and physical treatment, as it can bring about complete 
mineralization of the dye. Several species of species  have been reported to effectively 
decolourize azo dyes in a wide range of salt solution s [19 -21]. Microorganisms decolourize dyes 
by desulphonation of their aromatic moiety coupled with reductive cleavage of the azo bond to 
prohibit aromatic amine formati on, thereby, d etoxifying the aromatic amines [20,22] . Also, the 
adsorption of the dye molecules to microbial cells has been implica ted in the decolourization of 
dyes [23] . Several factors could affect the degradation of dyes by microorganisms, including 
factors related to the microorganisms themselves.  
The widely used phytotoxicity tests in vascular plants are the seed germination test (a direct 
exposure method) and the root elongation test [24,25] . Seed germination represents an important 
initial phase in  the life cycle of plants . Any adverse effect on the seed germination process 
would be detrimental to the establishment and healthy growth of plants.  
This study aims to isolate azo dyes degrading bacteria from the soil and assess their ability to 
degrade methyl orange and basic violet dyes, as well as to assess the phytotoxicity of the dye on 
sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ) seeds . 
Materials and Methods  
Sample Collection  
The soil samples were collected from a laboratory -scale textile mill and printing press at th e 
University of Port Harcourt, Port Harcourt. These samples were collected at a depth of 10cm in 
10g amounts into a sterile Erlenmeyer flask.  
The dyes used are methyl orange (Acid orange 52) with 85% purity and the dye crystal violet 
(Basic violet 3) with  95% purity (BDH Chemicals Ltd, England). Stock solutions of each dye 
were prepared by dissolving 0.1g of dye into 100 ml of the mineral salt medium.  
Isolation of Dye Degrading Bacteria  
One gram of each dye was added into a 25ml mineral salt medium, follo wed by the addition of 
1g of soil sample. The flask was shaken properly and incubated in a shaker incubator 
(Barloworld Scientific Ltd, U.K) at 50rpm at 300C. The cultures were observed daily for 
decolourization of the dye. After 14 days of incubation, 1ml  of culture from each flask was 
serially diluted by Ten -fold serial dilution using physiological saline and spread plated onto 
mineral source agar medium in Petri dishes contained. Colonies which developed after  
 
 incubation at 300C were picked and repeatedly sub -cultured onto nutrient agar plates to obtain 
pure isolates.  
Identification of Isolates  
Isolates were identified following Gram reaction, motility, and spore formation, and based on 
their biochemical profiles following citr ate, oxidase, methyl red, Voges -Proskauer, indole, TSI 
(Triple Sugar Iron), starch hydrolysis, sugar fermentation test.  
Preparation of standard inoculum  
Isolates were picked from the stock culture and each was inoculated into 10ml sterile nutrient 
broth co ntained in test tubes. The cultures were incubated at 370C for 24 hours. These served as 
the standard inoculums for the various tests.  
Screening of Isolates for the Degradation of Methyl Orange and Crystal Violets  Dyes  
All bacterial isolates were screened for the ability to degrade methyl orange and crystal violet 
dyes in test tubes containing 20mls of stock solution. Isolates that were able to decolourize the 
dyes were considered as dye degrading bacteria.  
Degradation of Dye  
A loopful of each isolate fro m the standard inoculums was inoculated into 10ml of sterile 
nutrient broth in test tubes. Cultures were incubated at 370C for 24 hours. After incubation, 1ml 
from the culture was inoculated into 50ml of dye of different concentrations (0.00025mg/ml, 
0.000 5mg/ml, 0.001mg/ml and 0.002 mg/ml) contained in 250ml Erlenmeyer flask and 
incubated at 370C. 
Degradation was monitored daily for four days as follows: Two millilitres were withdrawn from 
each flask starting from day one and was centrifuged at 1000rpm for  30 minutes in an 800 
Electric Centrifuge (Xiangtian, China). The supernatant was decanted and analysed.  
The optical density was read using Spectrophotometer (EMCLAM, Germany) at 505nm for 
methyl orange and 588nm for crystal violet.

Phytotoxicity Assay  
Phytotoxicity was conducted a s per the me thod of Oyedeji and Immanuel [26]  with 
modifications. Ten viable sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ) seeds were pre -treated to prevent fungal 
growth by soaking them in sodium hypochlorite (3.5%w/v) solution for 8 minutes and 
subsequently rinsed ten times with sterile distilled water. Pre -treated seeds were placed on 
sterile Whatman No.1 filter papers in sterile Petri dishes. The Petri dishes wer e divided into 
three sets which consisted of set A (control experiment) which was irrigated with sterile distilled 
water; set B which was irrigated with untreated dye solution and set C which was irrigated with 
treated dye solution. The plates were irrigat ed daily with 5 ml of the dye solutions and were 
incubated at room temperature (25¬∫C).All experiments were carried out in triplicates. Seeds 
were considered to have germinated when root elongation was observed. The lengths of the 
radicles were recorded aft er 4 days. Toxic effect was measured in terms of percentage of 
phytotoxicity as:

Discussion  
Two azo dyes degrading bacteria were isolated from small -scale textile mill -contaminated 
soil. The isolates were identified as E. coli  and Bacillus subtilis . Both isolates decolourized 
the methyl blue and crystal violet dyes. Decolourization of substrates is often associated with 
the degradation of the dye as decolourizing efficiency was dependent on the growth of the 
isolate in the flask  [11,20] . The re was neither growth nor decolourization in the control 
flasks. This evidence that the decolourization was due to the metabolic activity of the 
organisms and not due to any abiotic factors, in agreement with Oranusi and Ogugbue [20]. 
The dyes served as ca rbon, energy and nitrogen sources for the isolates as alluded to by 
Oran usi and Mbah [18] . 
 
Several bacterial species have been reported to degrade azo dyes including species of Proteus, 
Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas ,Actinobacillus, Mycobacterium, Bacillus  and E. coli [11,19,20] . 
E. coli  and Bacillus subtilis  have been reported to degrade methyl blue, a cationic dye, in

 earlier studies, on account of their  high metabolic diversity [20,27] . The efficiency of azo dye 
biodegradation by the two isolates can be i nfluenced by factors such as the initial dye 
concentration, the presence of co -substrates, and the cultivation conditions such as pH, 
temperature, and oxygen availability. Therefore, cultural conditions must be optimized to 
increase the efficiency of dye d egradation. Aromatic amines generated by the reductive 
cleavage of azo dyes are potentially tox ic, mutagenic and carcinogenic [5,11] . The reduction 
in the toxicity of the dyes after treatment as the isolates utilized the dyes as a source of 
nitrogen might have detoxified the parent compounds or any intermediates formed as alluded 
to by Chivukula and Renganathan [28]  and Abadulla et al. [29] . 
In the present study, the general effect of the two dyes on germination followed the same 
patterns. The percentage of  phytotoxicity of both dyes increased with an increase in 
concentration. Although higher concentrations of the dye exert a phytotoxic effect ranging 
from 47 -93%, the lower concentration of the dye also exerted an adverse phytotoxic effect on 
the seed by 33 -64%. However, the treated dye exerted toxicity of 9 -22% at the lowest 
concentration of 0.00025 mg/ml and toxicity of 32 -56% at the highest concentration of 0.002 
mg/ml. This reemphasized that indiscriminate disposal of azo dye -containing waste into soil 
and water bodies poses a major threat to the environment.  
 
Conclusion  
The present study showed that microbiological treatment of dyes is an efficient way to 
detoxify methyl red and crystal dyes. The toxic effect of dyes reported in this study suggests 
the n eed for remediation of textile dyes in the industry effluents before discharging them into 
the environment.Whatever treatment is adopted should ensure complete conversion of dye 
components to avoid the build -up of toxic metabolites.
