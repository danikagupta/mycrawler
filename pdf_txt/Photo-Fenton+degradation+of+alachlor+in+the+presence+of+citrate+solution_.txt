Abstract 
A falling film dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reacto r combined with adsorption on activated carbon textile material  
was optimized to minimize the formation of hazardous oxidation by-products from the treatmen t of persistent pesticides 
(alachlor, diuron and isoproturon) in water. The formation of b y-products and the reaction mechanism was investigated by 
HPLC-TOF-MS. The maximum concen tration of each by-product was at least two orders of magnitude below the initial 
pesticide concentration, during the first 10 min of treatment. After 30 min of treatment, the individual by-product concentrat ions 
had decreased to values of at le ast three orders of magnitude below the initial pesticide con centration. The proposed oxidatio n 
pathways revealed five main oxi dation steps: dechlorination, dealkylation, hydroxylation, addition of a double-bonded oxygen 
and nitrification. The latter is  one of the main oxidation mech anisms of diuron and isoproturon for air plasma treatment. To o ur 
knowledge, this is the first time that the formation of nitrifi cated intermediates is reported for the plasma treatment of non -
phenolic compounds. 2

1. Introduction 
The increasing chemical pollution of both surface and ground wa ter resources has become a global 
public concern as many related long-term effects on aquatic lif e and on human health are poorly 
understood [1]. Even at concentrations in the order of microgra ms per liter and below, a wide spectrum 
of chemicals poses a potential risk due to their capacity to bio-accumulate and to persist in the 
environment, as well as their possible bioactivity [2]. In this context, agriculture is often considered to 
be a diffuse source of pesticides. Yet, pesticide transport towards surface water is complex and also 
occurs in urban areas [3], leadi ng to a significant pesticide l oad on both rural and municipal wastewater 
treatment plants. Ongoing improve ment of wastewater treatment has led to the development of methods 
termed advanced oxidation processes. They are defined as methods used to decompose target water 
pollutants by means of intermitte nt highly reactive species, su ch as ozone and hydroxyl radicals [4].  
 
In the transfer of advanced oxidation processes towards real-wo rld application, it is a major challenge 
to avoid hazardous oxidation by-products. The rise in transient  toxicity during wastewater treatment has 
been observed in advanced oxida tion processes for many types of  micropollutants, in particular for the 
pesticides alachlor, diuron and isoproturon [5]. Moreover, the addition of activated carbon in advanced 
oxidation processes influences the formation of by-products by its catalytic effect on oxidants, its surface 
chemistry involving adsorbed compounds and its changing surface  properties due to oxidation reactions 
[6, 7]. In order to gain more insight into the associated risks , identification of intermediate degradation 
products is required and the main  oxidation steps need to be re vealed.  
 In our previous research, we have developed, characterized and optimized a new type of water treatment 
reactor, which combines oxidative treatment by dielectric barri er discharge (DBD) with micropollutant 
adsorption on activated carbon textile and with additional plas ma gas bubbling [8, 9]. The presence of 
an adsorptive material, such as activated carbon, in a DBD reac tor was shown to have a synergetic effect 
on micropollutant removal [10]. Moreover, a DBD reactor also al lows for regeneration of the activated 
carbon [11] and thus prolongs the lifetime of the activated car bon. The present work focusses on the 
analysis of oxidation by-products from alachlor, diuron and iso proturon in the reactor by means of high-
performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrome try (HPLC-TOF-MS). The choice of 
these three pesticides is based on their toxicity [1, 12, 13], their worldwide occurrence as micropollutants 
in the environment [13-15], their persistence in the effluent o f conventional wastewater treatment plants 
[16, 17] and because of the ecological risk posed by their degr adation by-products [13, 14]. Oxidation 
experiments are performed with air plasma and the proposed oxid ation pathways are subsequently 3 
 compared with the cases of argon plasma and oxygen plasma, since these are commonly used working 
gases in studies on water treatment by plasma. More specifically, argon plasma is frequently chosen to gain more fundamental insight, due to its simple and well-chara cterized chemistry. The results are 
explained and discussed through insights from literature, toget her with the implications of this work on 
future research.  
2. Experimental methods and materials 
2.1. DBD water treatment reactor 
Each pesticide decomposition experiment is performed with the plasma reactor described in our previous 
studies [8, 9]. In short, a pesticide solution is continuously recirculated between a plasma chamber and 
an ozonation chamber. The plasma chamber consists of a coaxial DBD electrode system, where the 
grounded inner electrode is covered with one layer of Zorflex®, 100% activated carbon textile. The 
solution to be treated flows dow nwards along the carbon textile . Plasma is generated in dry air over the 
carbon textile by applying a pulsed AC high voltage on the oute r mesh electrode that covers the tubular 
quartz glass dielectric barrier. In order to obtain uniform pla sma treatment of the water film, the textile 
was carefully fixed to the inner electrode. In the ozonation ch amber, the plasma generated ozone is 
bubbled through the solution for additional pesticide oxidation. Samples of the solution are taken from 
the ozonation chamber for micropollutant analysis at treatment times of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 
min. The reactor reference settings are given in Table 1. Infor mation on the Zorflex® textile and on the 
method for power determination is provided in [8, 9]. The initi al solution of each micropollutant was 
made by dissolving 1.5 mg/L of the respective pesticide in deio nized water. The experiments were 
repeated for initial concentrations of 30 mg/L, for additional confirmation of each detected oxidation 
by-product. Furthermore, the experiments were repeated with argon and oxygen as working gas, for 
comparison with dry air.  Table 1.  Reactor reference settings for the experiments in this work.

2.2. Oxidation by-product analysis method.  
The oxidation by-products are determined by comparison of treat ed and untreated water samples by 
means of high-performance liqui d chromatography coupled to diod e array UV detection and time-of-
flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS). For liquid-liquid extra ction, a volume of 1.5 mL 
dichloromethane (CH 2Cl2) was added to 45 mL water and the mixture was shaken for 5 min . 
Subsequently, 0.45 mL of the CH 2Cl2 solution was extracted by means of a micropipette. Analysis was 
performed with an Agilent HPLC 1200 system consisting of a bina ry pump (Agilent Technologies, 
Waldbronn, Germany), a diode array detector (DAD) with a micro flow cell (volume: 1 mL, path length: 
10 mm) and a 6230 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) equ ipped with a Jetstream Electrospray 
Ionization source (ESI). Separa tions were conducted on a Luna C18 HPLC column (25 cm × 2.1 mm × 
5 µm) equipped with a 2 mm C18 pre-column (SecurityGuard cartri dge, Phenomenex). The mobile 
phase consisted of A: H 2O + 0.1% formic acid and B: Acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. A flow rate of 
200 µL/min was used. The initial conditions containing 2% B wer e held constant during 5 min, followed 
by a gradient up to 100% B in 50 min, a plateau of 100% during 10 min and back to initial in 2 min. 
Prior to each analysis series, the instrument was calibrated wi th the solution, following the procedure 
recommended by the manufacturer. In between analyses, the colum n was conditioned during 15 min. 
TOF-MS detection was performed in the positive jetstream electr ospray ionization mode, using the 
following parameters: capillary 4000 V, nebulizer 30 psi, dryin g gas 8 L/min, gas temperature 300 °C, 
sheath gas 8 L/min, sheath gas temperature 300°C, fragmentor 17 5 V, skimmer 66 V, OCT RF 750 V. 
Spectra were acquired from 50 to 1700 m/z at a scan rate of 1.0 2 s/spectrum. Lower masses were not 
measured, in order to limit noise in the measured data. All tes ts were carried out in duplicate with a 
regular blank solvent analysis, to ensure absence of cross cont amination. The chromatograms are 
manually scanned for ions present in the treated samples and absent in the untreated sample. 
Identification of the ions is c onducted with the molecular formula generator included in the Agilent 
Masshunter software. Since the molecular formula generator is not able to identify some of the detected 
ions, even for the high initial pesticide concentration of 30 m g/L, the likelihood of their identification is 
verified by the following additional data: 
 the presence or absence of a Cl atom in the ion, which is deduced from the characteristic isotope abundance pattern; 
 the experimental mass deviation Δppm; 5 
  the group-specific fragmentation pattern of the ions in electro spray ionization, which is 
determined by the abundance ratio and the difference in mass of  the ions in a mass spectrum, in 
comparison to similar solutes (i.e. molecules with a similar mo lecular structure) measured at 
different retention times in the chromatogram. This relative ab undance is calculated as the ratio 
of the corresponding peaks in the mass spectrum. 
A mass deviation around Δppm ≈ 15 or higher is usually not tole rated by the molecular formula 
generator, although it is common when the abundance is either t oo high or too low. Group-specific 
fragmentation is found by comparison of the mass spectra of dif ferent solute molecules with each other 
and with literature data. Such an approach based on group-specific fragmentation in LC-MS for the best 
confidence in contaminant identification has been previously pr oposed by Niessen in his review on 
pesticide dissociation patterns [18].  
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Alachlor oxidation by-products 
Table 2 lists all detected ions that are associated to alachlor  oxidation by-products. It can thereby be 
noted that both proton (H+) and sodium (Na+) adducts are detect ed. The former, is related to the protic 
solvents and mobile phase additives used in the HPLC method. The latter, which could be considered 
an impurity, is inherent to the used HPLC-TOF-MS method in the positive ionization mode and 
originates mainly from the used  glassware (such as the HPLC bot tles) and from pollutant traces in the 
used Milli-Q® water. With the exception of molecules 2A, 2B and 2D, whose pr otonated and/or sodiated 
ions are not fragmented, and 3E  and 3G, the fragmentation pattern observed for each proposed by-
product is identical to the one suggested in [19] for electrospray ionization of alachlor. As an implication, 
the N-substituted branches in the parent ion are identical to t he ones of alachlor, in agreement with the 
proposed molecular structures in Figure 1. Note that not all po ssible isomer structures are represented 
for each by-product in Figure 1. In particular, the exact posit ion of hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring 
or on the alkyl chains linked to the ring cannot be elucidated with the used techniques and remains 
therefore thus far unknown.  
Table 2.  Proposed identification of alachlor and its by-products, eluti ng at a specified retention time 
(RT), as deduced from the corresponding detected parent and daughter ions measured in HPLC-TOF-MS detected in the sample of highest abundance (SHA). For each ion, identification is based, among 
others, on the Δppm value as calculated from the measured mass m
exp and theoretical mass m cal, 
confirmation by the molecular for mula generator (CMFG) and its relative abundance (RA) to the 
associated Na adduct ion.  6

Figure 1.  Proposed oxidation pathway of a lachlor under DBD plasma treatment in air.  
 
As the mass spectra of by-products 3E and 3G indicate, the meth oxy function has been oxidized into 
formate, as displayed in Figure 1. This is in agreement with [2 0], where an identical oxidation 
mechanism is observed during ozonation of alachlor, as determin ed by means of collision-induced 
8 
 dissociation experiments. To our knowledge, Bouchonnet et al. w ere the first and only research group 
up to now to report this oxidation mechanism for alachlor.  
With the exception of molecule 2A, all proposed by-product stru ctural formulas are derived from 
alachlor by a combination of five types of oxidation steps: 
1. Dechlorination by substitution of chloride with a hydroxyl grou p; 
2. Hydroxylation by substitution of  hydrogen with a hydroxyl group ; 
3. Oxidation by substitution of two h ydrogen atoms with double bon ded oxygen; 
4. Dealkylation by substitution of an alkyl group with hydrogen; 
5. Nitrification by substitution of hydrogen with a NO group (nitr osation) or NO 2 group (nitration). 
The first four types are commonly encountered in ozonation and other advanced oxi dation processes of 
organic compounds. Direct oxidation by ozone is, however, a ver y selective process, in comparison to 
hydroxyl radical attack. Aromatic compounds with higher electro n delocalization are known to exhibit 
higher reactivity towards ozonation [21, 22]. This implies that  O3 attack is strongly electrophilic in 
nature and is preferably directed towards electron rich aromati c rings. Alterations of side-chains during 
ozonation, on the other hand, are mostly attributed to attack o f OH radicals, which are produced from 
ozone hydrolysis [23].  
 Nitrification is uncommon in m ost advanced oxidation processes, as it requires the presence of reactive 
nitrogen species. Lukes et al. recently identified nitrified ox idation products of phenol after oxidation 
with plasma in air atmosphere [24]. They proposed several reaction pathways for both nitrosation and nitration. According to their model, nitrated by-products can be formed through attack of NO
2ꞏ or NOꞏ 
radicals, nitrous and nitric acid in acidic conditions and decomposition of peroxynitrous acid in acid solution, while nitrosated by-products might result from NOꞏ ra dical attack, reaction with a nitrosonium 
NO
+ ion under acidic conditions or direct attack by a peroxynitrit e anion under alkaline conditions. To 
our knowledge, we are the first group to report experimental evidence on nitrification of non-phenolic micropollutants under plasma treatment in air. From our measure ments on alachlor, however, it is 
unclear whether by-product 3J results from nitrosation (3Ja) or  nitration (3Jb). 
 Figure A.1 and Table A.1 in the  appendix show the removal progr ess of alachlor and its oxidation by-
products. The estimated maximum concentration of each by-produc t is two to three orders of magnitude 
lower than the initial concentration of alachlor. After 30 min of treatment, only traces of 2A, 2C, 2E, 3B, 3D, 3H and 3J are detected, at estimated concentrations of at least three orders of magnitude below 
the original alachlor concentration. The five intermediates wit h highest abundance, 3H, 2E, 3D, 3B and 
2C, are all found in the oxidation pathway of Figure 1 as first  generation oxidation by-products. The 
most abundant intermediate, 3H, is supposed to be formed by con version of one of the ethyl side chains 
into an acetyl group. The exact same molecular structure was al so identified through both GC-MS and 9 
 HPLC-MS analysis as the main by-product in direct ozonation of alachlor as well as in the peroxone 
process [25]. Additionally, it has been reported as an oxidatio n product of alachlor in many other types 
of advanced oxidation processes (Table 3). This implies that 3H can be formed in our experiments 
through several oxidation mechanisms, such as direct attack by molecular ozone, and attack by a 
hydroxyl radical. Attack by an oxygen radical has also been pro posed in literature as a possible reaction 
mechanism [26]. In only a few studies, an isomer of 3H is identified where the added double-bonded oxygen is positioned at a different location [20, 25]. This sug gests that oxidation of the ethyl side chain 
into an acetyl group is favored over many other oxidation steps .

 Hydroxylation of alachlor into isomers such as 2C, 2E and 3D is  another commonly reported oxidation 
step for many oxidation techniques (Table 3). Often, multiple i somers are detected in one study. For 10 
 photocatalysis with TiO 2, the detected isomer is considered as one of the two main oxid ation by-products 
[32]. In most research on alachlor oxidation, the exact locatio n of the OH function is unknown and OH 
radical attack is proposed to occur to both the aromatic ring a nd the ethyl side chain. Next to that, also 
electrophilic attack of ozone on the benzene ring or on an ethy l group with formation of an OH function 
has been suggested [25]. 
 An isomer of 3B and 3E, where the methyl group of the methoxy function is removed, has been reported as an alachlor by-product in a ll associated studies referred to in Table 3. Additionally, an isomer of 3G, 
in which the methoxymethyl group was kept intact, has been dete cted as a consequence of ozonation 
and peroxonation of alachlor in [25]. Therefore, addition of th e two double-bonded oxygen atoms was 
suggested to be located on the ethyl side chains. All of these isomer structures, however, are in 
contradiction with the dissocia tion patterns of 3B, 3E and 3G m easured in our experiments. The 
structural formulas of these three by-products as proposed in Figure 1 are not found elsewhere in literature. Note in this regard that the methyl function in 3B and 3E possibly originates from an ethyl or 
–CH
2C(=O)H group, but that its formation from an acetyl group is im probable, considering the absence 
of the latter oxidation step in other experimental oxidation st udies, as well as in modeling studies, such 
as [35]. To our knowledge, also the chemical formulas of 2B, 3A , 3C, 3F, 3I and 3J in Table 2 have 
never been identified before as advanced oxidation by-products of alachlor. 
 For treatment with argon and oxygen plasma, all detected ions a ssociated to alachlor oxidation by-
products are given in Tables B.1 and B.2 in the appendix. The c orresponding proposed oxidation 
pathways are depicted in Figure 2. As the pathways suggest, hyd roxylation is favored under argon 
plasma, while it is less common under oxygen plasma. Furthermor e, oxygen plasma promotes the 
addition of double bonded oxygen and also reveals higher dechlo rination of alachlor. As expected, 
nitrification did not occur when using either an argon or oxyge n plasma. 11

3.2. Diuron oxidation by-products 
All detected ions that are associated to diuron oxidation by-pr oducts are listed in Table 4. Their removal 
progress and estimated concentration is presented in Table A.2 in the appendix. The maximum 
abundance of each by-product is thereby two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the initial diuron 
abundance and their estimated final concentration after 30 min is at least four orders of magnitude below 
the initial diuron concentration. The mass spectrum of the main  oxidation by-product 2B is in agreement 
with the one commonly reported in literature for N-demethyldiur on [36-40], which is the most 
frequently detected diuron by-product in advanced oxidation stu dies (Table 5). Interestingly, N-
demethylation is considered to be the main oxidation step of se veral substituted phenylurea herbicides, 
including isoproturon, linuron, fluometuron and metoxuron, whic h all possess a similar N-substituted 
branch as diuron [37].

The proposed structural formulas of 2C, 3A and 3B correspond to  first generation oxidation products 
formed by hydroxylation or nitration (Figure 3). The isomers 3C  and 4A are second generation oxidation 
by-products of diuron after one demethylation step and one nitr ation step (Figure 3). As their mass 
spectrum suggests, substitution of an NO 2 group occurred during oxidation to the aromatic ring, most 
likely on an alpha carbon relativ e to the N-substituted branch.

Figure 3.  Proposed oxidation pathway of diuron under the DBD plasma trea tment in an air atmosphere 
as used in this work.  
 
As depicted in Figure 3, the main oxidation steps in air plasma  treatment of diuron according to our 
experiments are 
 dechlorination, 
 hydroxylation,  
 demethylation and  
 nitrification.  
 Shankar et al. investigated by-product formation during photo-induced oxidation of diuron in aqueous 
solution by nitrites and nitrates [41]. Interestingly, they fou nd two isomers with formula C
9H9Cl2N3O3 
and two isomers with formula C 8H7Cl2N3O3 (Table 5). In all 4 cases, the fragmentation spectra in HPLC-
analysis indicated nitrification of the aromatic ring, a proces s which was enhanced in NO 2- conditions 
as opposed to NO 3- conditions. The authors explained these observations with elec trophilic attack of the 
ring by NO 2 radicals or the dimeric form N 2O4. NO 2 radical attack is also suggested in Lukes’ model for 
nitration of phenol in air plasma treatment. If the dominant nitrification mechanism in our experiments 
is indeed electrophilic in nature, NO or NO 2 substitution will ideally occur on  the aromatic cycle, at the 
ortho positions relative to the C -N bond, leading to the struct ural formulas of 2C, 3B, 3C and 4A as 
shown in Figure 3. This is in agreement with the simulation res ults of Carrier et al., who calculated the 
location of preference for electrophilic attack on the diuron s tructure [42].

Similarly, hydroxylation by an electrophilic OH radical attack is expected to take place on the ring with 
a higher probability compared to a reaction on the methyl group s. Yet, such trend is not clearly observed 15 
 experimentally. In advanced oxidation studies where monohydroxy lated diuron (3A) is measured, for 
instance, ring hydroxylation seems to be as likely as methyl hydroxylation, regardless of the type of 
AOP under consideration (Table 5). Either isomer has been repor ted as one of the three main diuron 
intermediates, e.g. in [38, 44, 49]. Carrier et al. performed T iO2-based photocatalysis on diuron and 
found four monohydroxylated diuron isomers [42]. Three isomers were attributed to OH substitution on 
the ring and one isomer to hydroxylation of a methyl function. Whereas OH attack of the aromatic cycle 
is a nucleophilic process, the methyl functions are assumed to be hydroxylated through hydrogen 
abstraction. Figure 4a shows the stepwise transformation of one  of the methyl groups into a 
hydroxymethyl or formyl function. First, attack of the methyl g roup by an OH radical leads to abstraction 
of one of the hydrogen atoms. Subsequent dioxygen attack result s in a peroxyl radical. Such radical is 
relatively stable and usually decays via bimolecular self-termi nation reactions to form a transient 
tetroxide which on its turn deco mposes into an alcohol or aldeh yde. To our knowledge, Mazzelier et al. 
were the first to postulate this mechanism for formyl formation  in diuron [50].  
 
 
 
Figure 4. (a) Oxidation steps of the diuron N-terminus into an alcohol or aldehyde, as proposed in [49]. (b) Stepwise mechanism behind diuron demethylation by DBD treat ment, as proposed in [43]. 
 Feng et al. conducted two studies on plasma treatment of diuron , with an AC powered DBD reactor [43] 
and with a pulsed bubble discharge reactor [54]. They reported several diuron intermediates in both 
studies with different alterations of the N-terminus. According ly, they proposed a stepwise mechanism 
for diuron demethylation, as presented in Figure 4b. In this li ne of thought, by-product 3A can be a 
precursor of 2B, on the condition that OH addition took place o n one of the methyl groups. Next to such 
demethylation precursors, Feng et al. also detected one dechlor inated intermediate in their DBD reactor, 
in agreement with the identification of 2A in our measurements.   
In our experiments, the abundance of each by-product decreases after 10 min of treatment and no new 
by-products are detected. As for other advanced oxidation proce sses, opening of the aromatic ring is 
16 
 expected, with further decomposition into smaller organics, suc h as oxalic acid, oxamic acid, acetic acid 
and formic acid [38, 55, 56].  
 
For argon and oxygen plasma, all detected ions associated to di uron oxidation by-products are given in 
Tables B.3 and B.4 in the appendix. Under oxygen plasma, only b y-product 2B is detected. The absence 
of 3A suggests that hydroxylation is quenched, as in the case o f alachlor. Under argon plasma, on the 
other hand, 2A, 2B and 3A are measured. As expected, nitrificat ion is once more not  observed for both 
gases.  
3.3. Isoproturon oxidation by-products 
Table 6 lists all detected ions associated to isoproturon oxida tion by-products, while Table A.3 in the 
appendix shows their removal progress. By-products with the highest abundance are, in descending 
order, molecules 2G, 3F, 3G and 3H. Their maximum abundance is two orders of magnitude lower 
relative to the initial one of isoproturon, while all other by-products are found with relative abundance of at least three orders of magnitude lower. After 30 min, the estimated final concentrations are at least four orders of magnitude lower than the initial isoproturon concentration. The proposed molecular structures of the detected by-products are given in the reactio n pathway of Figure 5. As deduced from 
the mass spectra, the isopropyl function of 2E and 3A is substituted by NO
2 and OH, respectively, while 
the isopropyl group is not oxidized for 2C, 2F and 3F. NO 2 substitution in 3H occurred to the aromatic 
ring.  Table 6.  Proposed identification of isoproturon and its by-products, el uting at a specified retention time

others, on the Δppm value as calculated from the measured mass m
exp and theoretical mass m cal,

Figure 5. Proposed oxidation pathway of isoproturon under the DBD plasma  treatment in an air 
atmosphere as used in this work. 
 Similarly to the previous cases, t he observed oxidation steps c an be classified into  
 hydroxylation,  
 addition of a double bonded O,  
 demethylation and  
 nitrification.  
Since no study is found on advanced oxidation of isoproturon in  the presence of nitrites or nitrates, the 
nitrificated intermediates have, to our knowledge, not been rep orted before. In our experiments, 
nitrificated by-products have the highest detected abundance in comparison to by-products formed by any other oxidation step. As this indicates, nitrification is either the most frequent oxidation step or it produces the most recalcitrant intermediates. In other studies on advanced oxidation of isoproturon, on 
the other hand, hydroxylation clearly is the most frequent degr adation mechanism. Singly hydroxylated 
isoproturon, such as 2B, 2C and 3A, for instance, is the most c ommonly encountered by-product (Table 
7). Three separate studies identif ied three isomers, of which t wo underwent OH subs titution on the ring 
and one at the isopropyl group [57-59]. Amorisco et al., Losito et al. and López-Muñoz et al. made more profound by-product studies for TiO
2-based photocatalysis and found substitution of H with OH to oc cur 
at basically every possible location: on the ring, in the isopr opyl and dimethyl amide groups and even 
at the secondary amide function [60-62].   
19 
 In contrast to diuron, transformation of a methyl into a formyl group is observed in our experiments for 
isoproturon by-product 2F, in the dimethyl amide function. This  by-product has only been reported 
before in two studies (Table 7). A lso here, formation of a hydr oxymethyl or formyl function is postulated 
to proceed with H abstraction as depicted in Figure 4a. Besides , multiple authors support the 
demethylation mechanism of Figure 4b for isoproturon [59, 60]. Single demethylation in the dimethyl 
amide function, resulting in 3F, has been observed in four othe r studies (Table 7). Remarkably, 
dealkylation in the isopropyl f unction is mostly accompanied by  replacement with OH, while this is 
rather an exception in the dimethyl amide function.

4. Conclusion 
We analyzed the oxidation by-products of alachlor, diuron and i soproturon in a falling water film DBD 
reactor with activated carbon textile, by means of HPLC-TOF-MS.  The oxidation pathways for the three 
plasma gases, i.e. air, argon an d oxygen, are presented. In the  case of air plasma, intermediates are 
predominantly formed through five types of oxidation steps: dec hlorination, hydroxylation, addition of 
double bonded oxygen, dealkylation and nitrification. For argon  and oxygen plasmas, nitrification does 
not occur, as expected. Although the exact site of oxidation is  unknown for the majority of by-products, 
the mass spectra often provide clear indications of which part in the molecular structure is affected. 
While the aromatic ring is theor etically expected to be the oxidation site of preference, oxidation of the 
side chains is detected as well, in good agreement with other s tudies on advanced oxidation. This is the 
first study, to our knowledge, where nitrification of non-pheno lic micropollutants through NO and NO 2 
radical attack by means of plasma treatment is detected. Remark ably, it is one of the major oxidation 20 
 steps for diuron and isoproturon, while only one minor nitrific ated by-product of alachlor is tentatively 
identified. As should be noted, nitrification is mainly observe d on hydroxylated by-products. Toxicity 
analysis of nitrificated intermediates is an important topic fo r future research to understand the feasibility 
of air plasma for water purification. A solution to prevent the  generation of toxic nitrificated by-products 
in industrial applications could be found in the use of an oxyg en based plasma instead of an air plasma.

 Appendix A – Supplementary data on the removal progress 
 
Figure A.1  Normalized abundance of each precursor pesticide as a function  of treatment time for air 
plasma. The abundance of each compound as measured with HPLC-TOF-MS is not calibrated and can 
only be used as indication of the corresponding concentration. For more detailed information on the 
removal rate of the pesticides in the reactor under various con ditions (e.g. as a function of initial 
concentration or as a function of the plasma gas), we refer to our previous publication [6]. 
 
Table A.1.  Removal progress and estimated c oncentration of all measured b y-products of alachlor in 
the case of air plasma. The estimated concentration C SHA in the sample of highest abundance (SHA) is 
determined from the abundance of the by-product in the SHA rela tive to the initial abundance of 
alachlor for an initial concentration of 1.5 mg/L. The estimated concentration is als o given at treatment 
times of 15 and 30 min (C 15min and C 30min), based on the abundance of each by-product at these 
treatment times relative to its  abundance in the SHA (relative abundance RA 15min and RA 30min, 
respectively). Since the HPLC-TOF-MS method is not calibrated, the estimated concentration values 
are only indicative, in order to u nderstand the order of magnit ude of the concentration.
