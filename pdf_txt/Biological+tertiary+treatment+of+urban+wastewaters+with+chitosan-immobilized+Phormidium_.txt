 XI Summary 
Algae-bacteria-based biotechnology has r eceived more and mo re attention in 
recent years, especially in the subtropical  and tropical regions, as an alternative 
method of conventional multistep wastewater  treatment processes. Moreover, the 
algal biomass generated during wastewater treatment is regarded as a sustainable 
bioresource which could be used for produc ing biofuel, agricultu ral fertilizers or 
animal feeds. Although this t echnology is attractive, a numbe r of obstacles need to be 
solved before large-scale applications. The main purposes of this work are to find 
more effective biomass harvesting st rategies and develop high-effective 
algal-bacterial systems to improve wast ewater treatment performance, biomass 
generation rate and biomass settleability. 
A wastewater-borne algal-bacterial cu lture, cultivated and trained through 
alternate mixing and non-mixing strategy, was used to treat pretreated municipal 
wastewater. After one month cultivation and training, the acclimatized algal-bacterial 
system showed high carbon and nutrient removal capacity and good settleability 
within 20 minutes of sedimentation. Alga l biomass uptake was the main removal 
mechanism of nitrogen and phosphorus. The biomass productivity, nitrogen and 
phosphorus accumulation in biomass during the wastewater treatment process were 
investigated. The characterization of th e microbial consortium composition in the 
enriched algal-bacterial system provide d new insights in th is research field. 
Aerobic activated sludge which already showed good settleability was used as 
bacterial inoculum to enhance the wastew ater treatment performance and biomass 
settleability of algal-bacterial culture. The influence of different algae and sludge 
inoculum ratios on the treatment efficiency and biomass settleabil ity was investigated. 
There was no significant effect of the inoculation ratios on the chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) removal. But algae/sludge in oculum ratio of 5 showed the best 
nitrogen and phosphorus removal effi ciencies (91.0 ± 7.0% and 93.5 ± 2.5%, 
respectively) within 10 days. Furthermore, 16S rDNA gene analysis showed that the 
bacterial communities were varying with diff erent algae and sludge inoculation ratios 
and some specific bacteria species were enriched during the operation. 
Four commonly used and high-potentia l microalgae species including one 
cyanobacteria ( Phormidium sp.) and three green microalgae species ( Chlamydomonas  
reinhardtii , Chlorella vulgaris  and Scenedesmus rubescens ) were cultivated and 
trained through alternate mixing and non-mi xing strategy for tertiary municipal 
wastewater treatment. Afte r one month of cultivation, th e four microalgae species XII were compared in terms of biomass settl eability, nutrien t removal rates and biomass 
productivity. The three green microalgae  showed good settleab ility within 1 h 
sedimentation and had higher bioma ss generation rates (above 6 g/m2/d). The nutrient 
removal efficiencies were 99% for the four  selected microalgae species but within 
different retention time, resulting in 3.66 ± 0.17, 6.39 ± 0.20, 4.39 ± 0.06 and 4.31 ± 
0.18 mg N/l/d (N removal rate) and 0.56 ± 0.07, 0.89 ± 0.05, 0.76 ± 0.09 and 0.60 ± 
0.05 mg P/l/d (P removal rate) for Phormidium  sp., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , 
Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus  rubescens , respectively. 
A mixed algal culture composed of three selected high-effective green microalgae 
(Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii , Chlorella vulgaris  and Scenedesmus rubescens ) was 
used for tertiary municipal wastewater tr eatment. The key biot ic factor (algal 
inoculum concentration) and abiotic fact ors such as illumination cycle, mixing 
velocity and nutrient strength were studi ed. Based on the nitrogen and phosphorus 
balance, it was found that assimilation into algal biomass was the main removal 
mechanism.1 Chapter 1 
Background and aims of the study 
1.1 Background and aims of the study 
The growing of world population and human activities pose a serious threat to the 
environment due to the release of a big amount of wastewater. To care for our 
environment and thus for our health, wastew ater needs to be treated before being 
returned to the environment. The algal- bacterial culture as a sustainable and 
cost-efficient biosystem for municipal, indus trial and animal wastewater treatment has 
experienced increased mome ntum over the past few years (Aslan and Kapdan, 2006; 
Borde et al., 2003; de-Basha n et al., 2002; Munoz and Gu ieysse, 2006; Munoz et al., 
2005; Olguin, 2003; Oswald, 1995; Zhang et al., 2011). It is especially favorable in 
regions with year-round high solar radiati on as the removal process is powered by 
solar energy (Oswald, 2003). Under illuminate d conditions, algae uptake nutrients and 
produce O 2 that may be used as an electron a cceptor by aerobic ba cteria to degrade 
organic matter. Algae also consume the CO 2 released from bacterial respiration to 
complete the photosynthetic cycle, whic h contributes to greenhouse gas abatement 
(Oswald, 1988; Oswald and Gotaas, 1957). In wa stewater-fertilized systems, the roles 
of algae include O 2 supply, nutrient uptake and adsorption of heavy metals (Munoz et 
al., 2006; Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995). Furthe rmore, the high pH and high dissolved 
oxygen concentration induced by algal photo synthesis would lead to indirect 
disinfection (Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995; Schu macher et al., 2003). Thus it is an 
attractive alternative or supplement to  the conventional multistep wastewater 
treatment process (Ahn, 2006; Oehmen et  al., 2007; Yeoman et al., 1988). 
In addition, algal-bacterial cultures for wast ewater treatment retain useful nitrogen 
compounds in the biomass instead of releas ing a majority of the nitrogen as N 2 or 
N2O gas with common nitrogen remova l methods such as bacterial 
nitrification/denitrificati on (Buys et al., 2000; Zeng et al., 2003). Furthermore, the 
microalgae accumulated during wastewater trea tment as an important bioresource can 
be used as animal feeds, soil amendments and agricultural fertilizers (Benemann et al., 
1977; Mulbry et al., 2008; Mulbry et al., 2006; Mulbry et al., 2005). In addition, they 
can also be used for biodiesel and bioga s production to face the global demand of 
renewable fuel resources in the near futu re (Rawat et al., 2011). Considering the 2 above, this algal-bacterial system would realize the integration of wastewater 
treatment with high added value algal biomass production (Christenson and Sims, 
2011). Not only the solar energy inducing algal photosynthesis is nearly free of charge, 
but also the nutrients in the wastewater ar e costless and ideally suited for algal mass 
cultures and the wastewater treatment reve nues could partly of fset algae production 
costs. 
However, harvesting the algal biomass from the discharge after wastewater 
treatment in a cost-efficient way remains a major hurdle to the implementation of this 
technology. Current harvesting methods incl ude physical based, chemical based and 
immobilized systems, but each of them has their own disadvantages (de-Bashan et al., 
2004; Lee et al., 1998; Pere z-Martinez et al., 2010; Sukenik and Shelef, 1984). 
Physical based methods such as filtration and centrifugation are cost-prohibitive for 
large scale use as the power requirements a nd investment are high (Shelef et al., 1984; 
Uduman et al., 2010). Chemical based technol ogy is often performed to promote the 
flocculation and coagulation by addition of  chemical compounds such as aluminum, 
aluminum chloride, ferric cations and calcium  chloride (Imase et al., 2008; Lee et al., 
1998; Oh et al., 2001). Such technology needs a dditional costs for ch emicals, leads to 
the increase of effluent salinity and cause s secondary contaminations (Nurdogan and 
Oswald, 1995). Immobilization system also of fers an option for harvesting biomass. 
There are two kinds of immobilization technol ogy. The first one is through increasing 
the particle size with natural or synthe tic polymers such as chitosan, alginate, 
carrageenan and cellulose fibres (de-Bash an and Bashan, 2010; Gonzalez and Bashan, 
2000), but these polymeric matrices are cost ly and weak during long-term operation 
(Chevalier and de la Noue, 1985a; Su et al ., 2009). The second one is attached system 
by promoting the formation of algal biofilm  on the carrier, but the photoinhibition and 
diffusional transport within the biofilm coul d result in low nutrient removal efficiency 
(He and Xue, 2010). Therefore, a more effec tive biomass harvesting strategy such as a 
settleable algal-bacterial system is requi red. Besides, Gutzeit et al. (2005) used 
Chlorella vulgaris  and activated sludge to cultivate algal-bacterial aggregates in SBR 
mood for wastewater treatment. These aggregates showed a good settleability. 
However, whether this good settleability is because of activated sl udge is uncertain in 
previous works. 
Usually, the algal species were selected  to be used for coupled wastewater 
treatment and algal bioproducts production according to the nutrients removal rate, 
biomass productivity and lipid content (Gonzalez et al.,  2008b; Subashchandrabose et 
al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). But there is a lack of syst ematical comparison of these 
commonly used algal species as most of th ese researches were performed separately 3 under different environmental conditions and bioreactor configurations. More 
importantly, the settleability of an algae-base d culture should also be considered as an 
important algal selection criterion associat ed with the success of the whole system. 
Besides, although the identification and bi ometry of the dominant algal species 
have been investigated in previous researches (Godos et al., 2009), the information on 
the bacterial community involved in these symbiotic cultures is still blank. Because 
bacteria as an important partner have maintained symbiotic relationship with algae, 
investigation of the microbial compositions  and their functionalities could provide 
some insights into these synergistic systems. 
Therefore, the main objectives of this PhD project were to improve the nutrient 
removal performance and reduce the algal biomass harvesting costs for municipal 
wastewater treatment with algal-bacteria l culture from the point of views of 
cultivation strategy, high-pot ential algae-based culture sele ction and the investigation 
of the influence of abiotic and biotic  factors. Specific objectives are: 
 Cultivation and training of the settleable  algae-based culture through alternate 
mixing and non-mixing strategy 
 Developing the novel and settle able algal-bacterial syst em with different algal 
and bacterial compositions to improve the treatment performance and biomass 
settleability 
 Selection of high-potential unicellular microalgae species in terms of nutrient 
removal, biomass productivity and settleability 
 Investigation of the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the treatment 
performance, biomass generation and settleability 
 Investigation of N and P removal mechanisms 
 Identification and characterization of th e microbial consortium composition in 
algal-bacterial culture 
In order to fulfill the above objectives, the following work-tasks were addressed. 
1. Municipal wastewater treatment and biomass accumulation with a 
wastewater-born and settleable algal-bacterial culture ( Paper I in Appendices ) 
   A settleable algal-bacterial culture, co mposed of wastewater-borne algae and 
wastewater bacteria, was cultivated thr ough alternate mixing and non-mixing strategy 
to treat municipal wastewater. The N and P removal mechanisms were explored for 
better understanding of the sy stem. Besides, the biomass generation and the processes 
of N and P accumulation into biomass were monitored. The evolution of the microbial 
community of this algal-bacterial culture was investigated as a new insight in this 4 area. 
2. Synergistic cooperation between wast ewater-born algae and activated sludge 
for wastewater treatment: Influence of algae and sludge inoculation ratios ( Paper 
II in Appendices ) 
   Aerobic activated sludge was used as  bacterial inoculum to enhance biomass 
settleability and the wastewater treatment capacity. The influences of the algae and 
activated sludge inoculati on ratios on the removal ef ficiency and corresponding 
biomass settleability were explored for further optimization. The nutrient removal 
mechanisms were studied for better unders tanding of the symbiotic system with 
different algae and sludge inoculation ratios. The microbial communities enriched in 
the reactors with different inoc ulation ratios were studied. 
3. Comparison of nutrient removal capacity and biomass settleability of four 
high-potential microalgal species ( Paper III in Appendices ) 
Four commonly used and high-potential microalgal species including one 
cyanobacteria and three green microalgae, were cultivated and trained through 
alternate mixing and non-mixing strategy for te rtiary wastewater treatment. The four 
selected microalgae were compared in terms of nutrient removal rate, biomass 
settleability and biomass generation rate . The N and P balance of four different 
algae-based cultures were evaluated. 
4. Coupled nutrient removal and biomass pr oduction with mixed algal culture: 
Impact of biotic and abiotic factors ( Paper IV in Appendices ) 
As the mixed algal culture showed better nutrient removal rates compared with the 
individual unicellular green algal species, a mixed algal culture composed of three 
green microalgae species selected based on the results of Paper III, was used for 
tertiary wastewater treatment to optimize the algae-based system. The biotic (algal 
inoculum concentration) and biotic factor s (illumination cycle, mixing velocity and 
nutrient strength) on nutrient removal, biomass productivity and biomass settleability 
were explored. The N and P removal mechanisms in certain favorable conditions were 
evaluated.

Microalgae 
2.1 The advantages and potentials of microalgae 
In this study, the definition of micr oalgae includes prokar yotic cyanobacteria 
(blue-green algae), eukaryotic microalgae (g reen algae, red algae, golden algae and 
brown algae). They belong to one of the ol dest life-forms of earth, which constitute 
the basis of the food chain and contribute approximately 40 to 50% of the oxygen to 
the atmosphere (Andersen, 2005; Brennan and Owende, 2009). Compared with 
terrestrial crops, microalgae show some advantages: (1) The average productivity of 
microalgal cultures is 15 g/m2/d being much higher than the current average world 
crop productivity (0.1 g/m2/d) (Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995); (2) As microalgae grow 
in aqueous media, no additional water (e.g. irrigation) is needed and the load on 
freshwater sources is reduced (Dismukes et  al., 2008); (3) Under favorable conditions, 
microalgae are capable of all year r ound production (Schenk et al., 2008); (4) 
Herbicides or pesticides are not required during algae cultivation (Rodolfi et al., 2009). 
Besides, a wide range of applications are explored due to their high protein content 
and the ability to synthesi ze an extraordinary variety of metabolites (Table 2.1). 
2.2 Microalgal metabolism 
Microalgae could either be  autotrophic or heterotroph ic and some species are 
mixotrophic.  
2.2.1 Autotrophic metabolism 
For autotrophic algae, photos ynthesis is their key survival  mode, as all microalgae 
are photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is the pr ocess of transferring light energy into 
chemical energy and converting CO 2 and water into carbohydrates and oxygen, which 
is quite similar in algae and higher plants  (Richmond, 2004). It includes two processes: 
light (light-dependent ) reactions and dark (light-inde pendent) reactions (Fig. 2.1). The 
photosynthetically active radia tion ranges from 400 nm to 750 nm, which represents 
about 40% of the direct so lar irradiance (Richmond, 2004). In  the light reactions, light 10 energy (natural or artificial) is captured by antenna pigments and excites the electrons 
in photosystem  I. The excited electrons are used  to reduce nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to nicotin amide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
dihydrogen (NADPH 2). The lost electron in photos ystem I is compensated from 
photosystem II, which causes the concomitant  synthesis of adenosine-triphosphate 
(ATP). The photosystem I gains the electrons  from photosystem II, the electrons lost 
by photosystem II are further re placed by splitting water (H 2O → 2H++ 2e- + 1/2O 2) 
(Falkowski and Raven, 1997). The NADPH 2 and ATP generated in light reactions are 
required and participate in the dark reactions to incorporate CO 2 into carbohydrate via 
a cyclic pathway called the Calvin cycle (Raven et al., 2005). The light reactions are 
the precondition of dark reactions, as dark reactions rely on the products of the light 
reactions.

Figure 2.1  General schematic diagra m of algal photosynthesis  
The carbohydrates produced by photosynthe sis are used as carbon skeletons to 
form other organic compounds in the algal ce lls. There are major in teractions between 
N-assimilation and photosynthetic metabolis m. N-metabolism (the synthesis of 
protein and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA )) is integrated with the generated 
carbohydrates, accounting for approximately 50% of algal carbon (Vanlerberghe et al., 
1990). The energy required for the assimilati on of N is also provided through further 
use of the carbohydrates which were accumulated by photosynthetic processes 
(Turpin, 1991). Table 2.2 summarizes the N-assimilation process with the main N 
sources (NH 4+, NO 3- and NO 2-) in algal cells (Table 1.2). NO 2- should be transferred 
into NH 4+ first and then further into the polypeptide synthesis. NO 3- needs more steps 
(NO 3- → NO 2- → NH 4+) to finish the protein synthesis.  After that, a group of proteins 
of the ammonium transporter family is requ ired to transport the ammonium across the 
membranes to finish the synthesis of ami no acids (Perez-Garcia et al., 2011; Turpin, 
1991). Paper III indicates that microalgae prefer to use ammonium first, followed by 
nitrate and nitrite. These results are consiste nt with previous studi es (Perez-Garcia et 
al., 2011).

2.2.2 Heterotrophic metabolism 
Not all microalgae can grow under he terotrophic conditions and only a few 
microalgae species are heterotrophi c (Lee, 2001). Heterotrophic algae are 
non-photosynthetic and therefore, require organic matter to replace light as the 
substrate and energy source for their growth  (Kaplan et al., 1986). During respiration, 
oxygen is supplied through aeration to mineralize organic substrate into CO 2 
(Griffiths et al., 1960). 
  For heterotrophic microalgae, glycol ysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), 
glyoxylate cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), nitrogen assimilation and 
fatty acid synthesis are the main important metabolisms (Perez-Garcia et al., 2011). 
Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that tr ansfers glucose into pyruvate and generates 
concomitant ATP. The generated pyruvate is then converted into acetate and 
transferred into the mitochondrion and further to the TCA cycle under aerobic 
conditions. Through the TCA cycle, acetate in form of acetyl-CoA is further oxidized 
into CO 2, and following along with this proc ess, energy (e.g., ATP) and precursors 
(e.g., NADH) are generated for further me tabolic activity (Lowenstein, 1969). The 
TCA cycle is the central important chem ical reaction for car bohydrate, lipid and 
protein metabolism. PPP is a glucose oxidation process generating reducing 
equivalents (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen, NADPH), 
ribose-5-phospate (R5P) for nucleotides  and nucleic acids  synthesis, and 
erythrose-4-phosphate (R4P) for amino acids  synthesis (Kruger and von Schaewen, 
2003). Although PPP and glycolysis are the only two ways for glucose breakdown in 
algal cells, they play different roles and ta ke place under different conditions (Neilson 
and Lewin, 1974). Glucose is mainly metabo lized via PPP under dark conditions as 
anabolism. And the Glycolysis mainly takes place in light conditions as the glycolytic 
process (Yang et al., 2000).  Glyoxylate cycle is the altern ative anaerobic process for 
TCA to utilize simple carbon compounds as  the carbon source when complex carbon 
sources such as glucose are absent (Kondrashov et al., 2006). 13 Although it is impossible to precisely predic t which specific substrate could be used 
or preferred by any given microalgae specie s, glucose is available to the great 
majority of heterotrophic algae which is most commonly used (Droop, 1974; Neilson 
and Lewin, 1974). More than 85% of the assi milated glucose is converted to oligo- 
and polysaccharides. About 1% remains are as  free glucose in algal cells and the other 
are used for catabolism to provide energy. 
 As for autotrophic microalgae, carbon a nd nitrogen metabolism are closely linked 
because the required carbon skeletons fo r N-assimilation are supplied through 
respiration (heterotrophic algae) and CO 2 fixation (autotrophic algae), whereas the 
required energy derives from TCA cycle and electron transport chain (Perez-Garcia et 
al., 2011). Ammonium, nitrat e and urea are the main nitrogen sources for algal 
N-assimilation, as well as yeast extract, pe ptone, amino acids and purines (Chen and 
Chen, 2006; Ganuza et al., 2008; Perez-Garcia et al., 2011). It is reported that the 
preferred nitrogen source of most microa lgal species follow a declining order: 
ammonium > nitrate > nitrite > urea (Perez-Garcia et al., 2011). 
Mixotrophic microalgae could grow th rough both autotrophy and heterotrophy and 
there is no definite switch between th em, except in total darkness (Richmond, 2004). 
2.3 Microalgal cultivation 
Carbon is the basic element for microalgal  growth which is supplied in terms of 
CO 2 for autotrophic algae and organic carbon for heterotrophic algae. Besides, several 
inorganic elements are universally required fo r algal growth, such as N, P, K, Mg, Ca, 
S (macronutrients) and Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn (m icronutrients). Some algae require Co, 
Mo, Na, Se, V or vitamins (Acreman, 1994). 
Basically two main photoautotrophic microalgal  cultivation systems are used so far: 
open raceway ponds and closed photobioreactor s (Chisti, 2007; Munoz and Guieysse, 
2006; Rawat et al., 2011). The open racew ay ponds are shallow open ponds built in 
raceway configuration with mixing and circulation paddle wheel (Brennan and 
Owende, 2009). The CO 2 requirement is usually from surface air or submerged 
aerators installed to enhance CO 2 absorption (Terry and Raymond, 1985). Although 
the theoretical biomass pr oductivity of open raceway ponds is around 50-60 g/m2/d 
(Christenson and Sims, 2011) , even a range of 10-20 g/m2/d is difficult to achieve in 
practice (Shen et al., 2009). Tubular or flat plate photobioreactors made of glass or 
plastic are the two types of closed systems and only the former type is used at large 
scale (Brennan and Owende, 2009; Tredici and Zittelli, 1998). They are arranged in a 
vertical, horizontal, helical or  inclined manner (Miron et al ., 1999; Molina et al., 2001; 14 Tredici, 1999). A mechanical pump or airlift system are used to allow CO 2 and O 2 to 
be exchanged as well as to  provide a mechanical mixi ng (Eriksen, 2008). The biomass 
productivities for closed reactors  generally range from 20-40 g/m2/d and are higher 
than those of open ponds (Shen et al., 2009). The comparisons of open raceway ponds 
and closed photobioreactors are summarized in Table 2.3. 
Table 2.3  Advantages and disadvantages of open ponds and closed photobioreactors 
Production system Advantages Disadvantages 
Relatively inexpensive to build and operate Low biomass productivity 
Low energy inputs Poor mixing and light 
Easy to clean Large area of land required 
 High pollution and contamination risks
 Limited to only a few species  Open raceway pond 
 Inefficient use of CO 2 
Better pH and temperature control E xpensive to construct and operate 
Less evaporation losses Some degree of wall growth 
Better protection against culture contamination Difficult to clean the walls of reactors 
More appropriate for sensitive strains  
and mono-cultivation  
Low cost harvesting cost due to high cell  
mass productivities  Closed reactor 
Low hydrodynamic stress  
Heterotrophic microalgae cultivation has b een developed by us ing organic carbon 
such as glucose instead of CO 2 as sole carbon and energy source in fermenters or 
stirred tank bioreactors (Brennan and Owende, 2009; Chen, 1996). Compared to 
photoautotrophic cultivati on, heterotrophic production systems eliminate the 
requirement for light, provi de a high degree of grow th control and lower the 
harvesting cost due to the higher microalg al cell concentration achieved (Chen and 
Chen, 2006). However, some problems, such as the limited number of available 
heterotrophic algae, inab ility to produce light-induced  products and potential 
contamination by bacteria, are still obst acles in this technology (Chen, 1996).

Municipal wastewater treatment and 
microalgae 
Municipal wastewater is a combination of wastewater originati ng from households, 
institutions, commercial establishments and indu strial facilities. It is high in organic 
matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and may also  contain toxic compounds and pathogenic 
microorganisms thus needing a treatment before being reused or returned to the 
environment. On the other hand, municipal wastewater could be used as a readily 
available and cost-effective substrate to fulf ill the requirements of microalgal growth 
(Nandini et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). Municipal wastewater treatment with 
algae-based technology woul d realize the integration of  wastewater treatment and 
algal biomass production. 
3.1 Municipal wastewater treatment 
Combinations of physical, chemical and bi ological methods are used to remove the 
contaminants from municipal wastewater. Several steps are usually needed to achieve 
the agreeable levels of effluent in th e wastewater treatment plant (Fig. 3.1). 
3.1.1 Primary treatment 
Primary treatment is the initial stage in th e treatment of municipa l wastewater. It is 
designed to remove floating and settleable so lid materials in raw wastewater mainly 
by physical processes. During the primary treatment process, the raw wastewater 
flows through a screen firstly to remove large floating objects. After that, it flows into 
a grit chamber where mineral pa rticles settle to the bottom.  With the screen and grit 
completed, wastewater then enters the last st ep to remove fine organic particles using 
further treatment such as sedimentation or gravity settling, sometimes supported by 
chemical precipitation (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003). The wastewater discharged after 
primary treatment still contains high amounts of organic carbon and nutrients which 
need further treatment.

3.1.2 Secondary treatment 
The aim of secondary treatment is to deplete dissolved and suspended organic 
matter. It is a process generally involving biological treatment which could be divided 
into attached growth based and suspended growth based systems (EPA, 2004). The 
mechanism of both attached and suspende d growth processes is that indigenous, 
water-borne microorganisms use oxygen and co nvert most of the organic matter in the 
wastewater into carbon dioxi de. The oxygen is provided by compressed air systems, 
mechanical agitation or inj ection of relative pure oxygen. 
  In attached growth processes, the mi croorganisms grow on the surface of certain 
carriers such as stone or plastic media. Th ere are three main attached growth process 
designs: trickling filters, biotower s and rotating biological contactors. 
  Suspended growth systems where the microorganisms are suspended in the 
wastewater under aerobic conditions, include aerobic ponds, varia tions of activated 
sludge, oxidation ditches and sequencing batch reactors. 70 to 85% of the biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD) entering with the primary effluent is removed in the aeration 
tank after several hou r of degradation by microor ganisms acclimated to the 
wastewater (EPA, 2004). The effluent after secondary treatment should flow to the 
second clarifier to remove the excess bacteria  by settling before discharging or further 
treatment. 21 3.1.3 Tertiary treatment 
Nitrogen and phosphorus, which could no t be removed by the conventional 
secondary biological treatm ent processes, are the ke y nutrients that cause 
eutrophication in aquatic water ecosystem s. The tertiary treatment (advanced 
wastewater treatment) is added in order to  further purify the secondary effluents. 
 Nitrogen 
  Autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic den itrification processes as conventional 
biotic methods are widely used for nitrogen  removal in wastewater treatment plants. 
In the nitrification process,  autotrophic nitrif ying bacteria convert ammonium to 
nitrites and further to nitr ates using molecular oxygen as the electron acceptors. 
Denitrification, where nitrates and nitrit es are converted to nitrogen gas, is 
accomplished by heterotrophic bacteria under anoxic conditions (Khin and 
Annachhatre, 2004). Usually, organic carbon of  the raw wastewater is used as an 
electron donor for denitrification. The related reactions are as follows: 
Nitrification: NH 4+ + 1.5O 2 → NO 2- + 2H+ +H 2O 
 NO 2- + 0.5O 2 → NO 3- 
Denitrification: 2NO 3- + 10H+ +10e- → N2 + 2OH- +4H 2O 
 2NO 2- + 6H+ +6e- → N2 + 2OH- +2H 2O 
Through the above two processes, nitrogen  in wastewater is released into 
atmosphere in form of nitrogen gas. Wh ile, during the denitrification process, the 
toxic gas (N 2O and NO) are important intermediates (NO 3- → NO 2- → NO → N2O 
→N2), which are also the products during conventional nitrogen removal processes 
(Clauwaert et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011). In addition, these two processes need to 
be separated in time or space as nitrification is carried out by autotrophic bacteria 
under aerobic condition and denitrification takes place in an environment free of 
oxygen with heterotrophic bacteria (EPA, 1975) . Besides, the consumption of a large 
amount of oxygen in nitrification process and the requirement of organic carbon to 
complete denitrification would increase the operation costs and energy inputs. 
Although some novel nitrogen removal systems, including anoxic ammonium 
oxidation process (ANAMMOX), single reactor system fo r high activity ammonium 
removal over nitrite  process (SHARON), combined SHARON and ANAMMOX 
process and completely autotrophic nitr ogen removal over nitr ite process (CANON) 
are developed to overcome the limitations of the nitrification/denitrification process 22 (Hendrickx et al., 2012; Magri et al., 2007; Third et al., 2001; van Dongen et al., 2001; 
Vilar et al., 2010). The strict operation conditi ons such as pH, temperature and initial 
ammonium concentration are difficult to be maintained, which hinders the wide 
application (Magri et al., 2007; Th ird et al., 2001; Vilar et al., 2010). 
 Phosphorus 
  The worldwide awareness of the need to control phosphorus emissions is growing 
with the increasing stringe nt discharge regulations in many countries. Not only 
removal but also reuse is important. Munici pal wastewater may contain from 4 to 16 
mg P/l and the effluent discharge limits  range from 0.01 to 2.0 mg P/l depending on 
the plant location and potential impact on receiving waters (Tchobanoglous et al., 
2003). Phosphorus removal can be achieved by  chemical precipita tion or biological 
phosphorus removal. Chemical precipitation is used to remove inorganic phosphorus 
by addition of specific chemicals such as  alum, lime or iron sa lts to promote the 
coagulation sedimentation process by gene ration of insoluble metal phosphate. This 
chemical method can reduce more than 95%  of the phosphorus concentration which 
has been used in many countries around the world (EPA, 2004). But the high volume 
of sludge (chemical precipitant) produced  during this process causes the secondary 
contamination as these chemi cal sludge is neither a good fe rtilizer nor a suitable raw 
material for further use (Smil, 2000).  
A group of microorganisms named polyphos phate accumulating organisms (PAOs) 
is largely responsible for P removal in the process of biological phosphorus removal 
(Oehmen et al., 2007). Under anaerobic condition, PAOs ar e selectively enriched in 
the bacterial community within the activated sludge and then assimilate fermentation 
products such as volatile fatty acids (VFA s) intracellularly as carbon polymers with 
the concomitant release of phosphate by cleavage of polyphosphate (Tchobanoglous 
et al., 2003). Under the following aerobic condi tions, PAOs are able to use the energy 
produced by oxidation of their stored poly- β-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) for their 
growth and the new biomass with hi gh polyphosphate st orage accounts for 
phosphorus removal (Oehmen et al., 2007). Ne t P removal from the wastewater is 
realized through removal of a portion of the activated sludg e storing a high amount of 
polyphosphates. The aerobic process could also be replaced by anoxic operations 
because some PAOs are able to use nitrat e or nitrite instead of oxygen through which 
both nitrogen and phosphorus are removed (H enze et al., 1997). Although this process 
is capable of phosphorus removal, the phosphor us removal efficiency  is variable and 
unstable in practice (Oehmen et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2010). 23 3.1.4 Disinfection 
Disinfection refers to the partial destruction of mi croorganisms or pathogens 
contained in untreated wastew ater that cause human diseas es (Tchobanoglous et al., 
2003). Chlorination, ozonization and ultraviolet radiation treatment are three most 
common used disinfection methods. Chlorine is an effective way for removing 
microbial pathogens by destro ying cellular material. But as chlorine is a highly toxic 
gas, any free chlorine remaining in wa ter would lead to dangerous outcomes. 
Although ozonization is a powerful way to dest roy viruses and bacteria, the ozone gas 
is unstable and costly. UV disinfection is a phys ical process that retards the survival of 
the microorganisms by destroying their ge netic material. The suspended solids or 
soluble organic matter in wastewater can reac t with or absorb the UV radiation thus 
reducing the disinfection performance. 
3.2 Municipal wastewater treatment with microalgae 
Municipal wastewater treatment with microalgae-based technology offers a 
cost-efficient and environmental friendly  alternative to c onventional treatment 
processes. In this system, microalgae assi milate nutrients in wastewater for their 
growth, generate oxygen through photosynthe sis thus offering a low-cost aerobic 
environment, absorb heavy metals and indi rectly remove pathoge ns and viruses by 
increasing pH, temperature and di ssolved oxygen concentration during 
photoautotrophic metabolism (Ansa et al., 20 11; Munoz and Guieysse, 2006). So far, 
algae-based technology is used for pretreated wastewater tr eatment, tertiary treatment 
and other advanced treatment (Jarvie et al ., 2002; Martinez et al., 2000; Olguin et al., 
2002; Wang and Lan, 2011). 
3.2.1 Pretreated municipal wastewater trea tment with algal-bacterial culture 
When using algal-bacterial culture for pret reated municipal wastewater treatment, 
organic matter is oxidized by heterotrophic bacteria into CO 2. Under the illuminated 
condition, microalgae fix the generated CO 2, assimilate the nutrients (NH 4+, NO 3- and 
PO 43-) in the wastewater and simultaneously produce O 2 through their photosynthesis, 
which is required by aerobic bacteria as electron acceptor (Fig. 3.2). In conventional 
wastewater treatment plants, the oxygen s upply accounts for more than 56% of the 
total energy cost (Oswald, 1995) . While, the energy consumption of microalgae based 
technology is greatly reduced as microalgae provide a low-cost aerobic condition for 24 aerobic bacteria. In addition, heterotrophic al gae could also contri bute to the organic 
carbon removal in the dark (Abeliovich and Weisman, 1978). 
 
Fig. 3.2  Symbiotic principle of algal-bacterial culture for municipal wastewater treatment 
In the 1950s, Owald et al. (1988) designe d large-scale open ponds called high-rate 
algal pond (HRAP) for algal growth and O 2 generation to fulfill the O 2 demand of the 
receiving domestic wastewater, which are by far the most cost-effective systems 
available for wastewater mana gement and for efficient capture of solar energy (Olguin, 
2003). They are usually 2-3 m wide and 10-30 cm deep shallow open ponds, and 
range from 1000 to 5000 m2. The highest BOD removal rate is up to 35g/m2/d under 
the optimal operation conditions (Munoz and Guieysse, 2006). And the hydraulic 
retention time (HRT) for continuous opera tion ranges between 4-10 days depending 
on climatic conditions (Rawat et al., 2011) . The advanced integr ated wastewater pond 
system (AIWPS) is an adapted traditional pond system developed by Oswald and his 
co-workers, which incorporates a series of low-cost ponds (Oswald, 2003). A typical 
AIWPS consists of advanced facultative pond followed by secondary facultative pond, 
algae settling pond and maturation pond (Green  et al., 1995; Tadesse et al., 2004). In 
Paper I, pretreated municipal wastewater  was treated in batch experiment. The 
removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) was around 75.2%, while the COD 
removal efficiency was about 98%. It has been re ported that the TOC removal rate is 
normally slower than that of COD (Zha ng et al., 2005), because some products of 
biodegradation have a higher oxidation st ate of carbon compared to the initial 
substrate. This is consistent with our re sults. The organic substa nce having the lowest 
COD/TOC ratio is oxalic aci d, with a carbon oxidati on state of +3.0 (COD/TOC = 
0.67). This means that, COD/TOC cannot be less than 0.67. In our results, COD/TOC 25 measured was as low as 0.2, which is not pos sible. We did not find a final explanation 
for this phenomenon. Aziz and Tebbutt (1980)  reported that, COD/ TOC ratio could be 
lower than 0.479 in the treate d wastewater effluent due to the less accurate COD 
analysis at low COD concentration. Acco rdingly, we suppose inaccuracies in the 
sampling and analysis were bei ng the cause of the deviations. 
3.2.2 Tertiary treatment with microalgae based technology 
Microalgae based technology has also been applied for tertiary treatment especially 
for further nitrogen and phosphorus rem oval, through two possible mechanisms: 
biotic removal through biomass assimilation and abiotic removal induced by the 
increase in pH through microalgal photosynthesis (Paper III;  Li et al., 2010b; McGriff 
and Mckinney, 1972). Microalgae require high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus 
for protein (45-60% of mi croalgae dry weight), nucleic acids and phospholipids 
synthesis (Laliberte et al., 1994). The nitr ogen assimilation could be increased after 
pretreatment of microalgae by starvation (R awat et al., 2011). In addition, as the 
content of organic carbon in tertiary influent is low, the CO 2 for microalgae 
photosynthesis is mainly in forms of inorgani c carbon from the air. It is reported that 
pH will increase in reactors with high i norganic/organic carbon during the microalgal 
photosynthesis (Hende et al., 2011). Besides, the algal pho tosynthetic growth would 
also cause the increase in pH. The elevated pH in the system w ould lead to ammonia 
volatilization and phosphorus pr ecipitation, which c ontributes to the overall nutrient 
removal efficiency  (Paper IV; Nurdogan and Oswa ld, 1995; Serodes et al., 1991). 
3.2.3 Other advanced treatments based on microalgae technology 
The microalgal photosynthesis has the poten tial in elimination of pathogens and 
viruses by increasing the pH, dissolved oxyge n concentration and temperature (caused 
by the conversion of light energy into h eat) in the culture (Ansa et al., 2011; 
Schumacher et al., 2003). Sun light inactivation of pathogens  and viruses is dependent 
on and increase with the pH and dissol ved oxygen (Van der Steen et al., 2000).  
Microalgae based culture has also been us ed to absorb and remove heavy metals 
due to the following reasons. (1) High pH  induced by microalgal photosynthetic 
growth promotes the production of heavy metal flocculation and sedimentation by 
chemical precipitation (Munoz , 2005). (2) As the surf ace of actively growing 
microalgae is negatively charged, polyvalent cations such as heavy metals can be 
strongly adsorbed thus removed from the wastewater (Munoz et al., 2006; Oswald, 
2003). 26 3.3 References

Microalgae harvesting strategies 
Both effective wastewater treatment and algal biomass production for further usage 
require separation of biomass from water.  How to harvest the microalgae remains a 
major practical limitation for microalgae based wastewater tr eatment technology due 
to the small size of th e microalgae (typically 3-30 μm diameter) and relatively low 
cell density in a typical open pond system (C hristenson and Sims, 2011; Grima et al., 
2003). There is no single best  harvesting microalgae met hod. The suitable technology 
should be chosen according to algal species , growth medium and end product (Shelef 
et al., 1984). Current harvesting methods in clude chemical based methods, physical 
based methods, biological based methods and immobilization systems. 
4.1 Physical based methods 
Nearly most of microalgae could be harv ested by centrifugation. It is a rapid and 
stable method for harvesting suspended al gae, based on density differences. More 
than 95% of cell harvest efficiency is obt ained at 13,000 × g (gravity) and the harvest 
efficiency is only around 60% at 6,000 × g (Grima et al., 2003). Although this method 
is effective in harvesting, it is highly en ergy intensive and not economical for large 
scale application (Pittman et al., 2011). 
Filtration is a common method to sepa rate solid from liquid. A conventional 
filtration process such as vacuum or pressu re filtration is not appropriate for small 
size microalgae, and only membrane micro-filtration or ultrafiltration are practical 
(Rawat et al., 2011). But the cost for pu mping and membrane replacement due to 
membrane fouling and clogging is also high (Uduman et al., 2010). 
Ultrasonic separation process uses ultrasound together with enhanced 
sedimentation to harvest microalgae biom ass. The maximum harvest efficiency is 
92% and the highest concentration factors ( up to 20) could be obt ained at low biomass 
concentration and low harvest flows (Bosma et al., 2003). 
Gravity sedimentation is a low cost met hod and usually the first biomass harvesting 
option for algal wastewater treatment syst ems due to the low value of the biomass 
generated in large treated volumes (Brennan and Owende, 2009). But the settling rates 
are unreliable and slow as oleaginous microa lgae cells are suspended in water and do 
not easily settle by natural gravity force (Z hang and Hu, 2012). Besides, the settling 32 rates are also dependent on th e overflow rates and the shap e of the gravity settling 
equipment (Christenson and Sims, 2011; Nurdogan and Oswald, 1996).  
4.2 Chemical based methods 
The surfaces of microalgae cells are gene rally negatively char ged which prevents 
their aggregation in cell suspensions (Zhang and Hu, 2012). Addition of chemical 
flocculants can reduce or neutralise this  charge and thus promote the chemical 
flocculation through increasing the partic le size. The algal biomass flocculation 
reactions are sensitive to the pH, properties of cellular surface, the flocculants 
concentrations, divalent catio ns and ionic strength (Oh et  al., 2001). Multivalent metal 
salts such as ferric chloride, aluminium sul phate and ferric sulpha te are widely used 
for charge neutraliz ation in the wastewater indu stry (Brennan and Owende, 2009). 
Nurdogan and Oswald (1995) enhanced alga l biomass autoflocculation by adding 
freshly slaked lime to the high-rate alga l pond. It was reported that addition of 
calcium chloride solution could increase the sheath (a polysaccharide gel) produced 
by microalgae thus promote the microalgal flocculation (Imase et al., 2008). Although 
the addition of chemical floccu lants is efficient and reliable, these cationic metals lead 
to an increase of heavy metal uptake into the sludge and also increase the effluent 
salinity causing a secondar y pollution (Christenson and Sims, 2011; Munoz, 2005). 
  An alternative flocculant are organic polymers such as chitosan, which do not cause 
a secondary contamination (Christenson and Sims, 2011). Chitosan is an edible and 
nontoxic flocculant, which costs 2  $/kg. In the previous study, more than 90% of 
biomass removal could be obtained usi ng 15 mg/l chitosan during acetonitrile 
treatment with algae base d technology (Munoz, 2005). Incr easing the algae culture 
pH by addition of hydroxide salts, such as  NaOH and KOH, could also enhance the 
biomass sedimentation through autoflocculation  (Lavoie and de la Noue, 1987; Lee et 
al., 1998; Pittman et al., 2011). The pH adju stment for flocculation has the advantage 
that it could minimize changes in the culture medium compared with 
chemically-induced flocculation, but for a la rge volume of culture, pH adjustment is 
also expensive. 
4.3 Biological based methods 
Compared with chemical based methods, biological methods are low cost, do not 
cause secondary pollutants but are not su fficiently reliable (Sukenik and Shelef, 33 1984).  
Biomass autoflocculation is the spontaneous  aggregation of particles associated 
with the increases of culture pH caused by CO 2 consumption by algal photosynthetic 
activity (Sukenik and Shelef, 1984). These alkaline conditions cause supersaturation 
of calcium and phosphate ions (Christens on and Sims, 2011). Excess of calcium 
phosphate precipitation could occur with al gae cell as a solid support thus promote 
algal flocculation  (Christenson and Sims, 2011; Lavoie and de la Noue, 1987). 
Autoflocculation is strongly dependen t on the proper concentration of Ca2+ and PO 43- 
in the medium and if their concentrations in the treated effluent are too low, the 
autoflocculation would not take place (La voie and de la Noue, 1987). The previous 
study showed microalgal autofloccu lation was obtained at 0.1 mM-0.2 mM 
(millimolarity, mmol/l) PO 43- and 1.5 mM-2.5 mM Ca2+ within pH of 8.5-9.0 
(Sukenik and Shelef, 1984). 
Bioflocculation is a microalgae sedimenta tion process induced by the extracellular 
polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by algae (Lee et al., 2009). The separation 
efficiency is related to the quantity of EPS and the aging of culture  (Lavoie and de la 
Noue, 1987). The maximum EPS productions ar e obtained at the end of the growth 
phase, possibly as a result of increased ce ll density (Christenson and Sims, 2011; 
Lavoie and de la Noue, 1987). The irradi ance and temperature have effects on 
microalgae EPS production (Wolfstein an d Stal, 2002). Although any microalgae 
species is able to produce the EPS, blue -green filamentous species are the most 
suitable organisms (Lavoie and de la Noue , 1987). In addition, activated sludge is one 
of the best sources of organisms to produ ce EPS and it also has a good settleability 
(Lee et al., 2009). Using activ ated sludge as bact erial inoculum in algal-bacterial 
culture for municipal wastewater treatment  could enhance the biomass sedimentation 
(Paper II). 
Some bacteria could excrete mucous mate rial as a microbial flocculant which 
enhances the algal flocculation activities. By  comparison of several bacteria isolated 
from different types of soil samples, it was shown that microbial flocculants from 
Paenibacillus  sp. AM49 were the best for harvesting Chlorella vulgaris  (Oh et al., 
2001). Furthermore, using microalgae species with self-aggregation properties is also 
a potential and low cost harvesting strategy . An algae-bacteria aggregate was formed 
with a good settlability which could se ttle down from initial 0.55 g VS/l to 18 mg 
VS/l after 10 min sedimentation (Gutzeit et al., 2005). In papers I, III and IV , a special 
cultivation strategy named alternate mixi ng and non-mixing cultivation was used to 
train and select microalgae species (bot h wastewater-borne algae and unicellular 
microalgae species) with good settling propert y. After 1 month of cultivation, the 34 systems showed good biomass sett leability, which indicated th at the proper  cultivation 
strategies are also very important for the breeding of settleable algae species.  
4.4 Immobilization systems 
Immobilization systems as effective harvesting methods have been widely 
described and tested for biological water treatment. Living cells are immobilized by 
natural or artificial means to prevent from  moving independently of their original 
location to all parts of an aqueous phase of a syst em (de-Bashan and Bashan, 2010; 
Tampion and Tampion, 1987). There are se veral types of immobilization methods: 
covalent coupling, affinity immobilizati on, adsorption, confinement in liquid-liquid 
emulsion, capture behind semi-permeable membranes and entrapment (or 
encapsulation) in polymers (de-Bashan and Bashan, 2010; Mallick, 2002).  
Among them, entrapment-based immobiliza tion technology is one of the most 
frequently used immobilization methods for algae-based wastewater treatment 
(Pittman et al., 2011). In this system, the substrates from the water and excreted 
products can diffuse to and from the cells  through pores in the polymers materials 
(Mallick, 2002). The chosen polymers shoul d be hydrophilic, nontoxi c and could keep 
the cells to live as long as possible and allo w the substrates to diffuse into the matrix 
with low cell leakage (de-Bashan and Ba shan, 2010; Pittman et al., 2011). Several 
synthetic (acrylamide, polyurethane, polyvinyl, resins, etc), natural polymers (agar, 
alginate, carrageenan, collagen cellulose, agaros e, etc), chitosan have been used as the 
immobilized matrix (Mallick, 2002; Olguin, 2012) . Carrageenan, agar and alginate are 
three preferred natural polysaccharide ma trices as they are renewable resource 
extracted from red algae or brown algae (Olguin, 2012). Little changes on the 
morphology of algal cell after immobiliza tion are observed with microscopes 
(Musgrave et al., 1983). The previous study al so showed that immobilized microalgae 
can grow well within gel beads and their growth curves were similar to those 
observed with free cells (Che valier and de la Noue, 1985b) . The freshwater microalga 
Chlorella vulgaris  and plant-growth-promoting bacterium Azospirillum brasilense  
were co-immobilized in small alginate b eads resulting in a significantly increased 
growth of the microalgae (Gonzalez a nd Bashan, 2000). Although the algal growth 
could be guaranteed after i mmobilization, the nutrient removal efficiencies decreased 
after several cycles. It wa s reported that the amm onium and phosphate removal 
efficiencies within 48 h were 100% and 83% , respectively, in semi-continuous culture 
during the first cycle, but decreased after several cycl es (de-Bashan et al., 2002). 
Besides, Ca2+ is used in the process to form gel entrapments in these natural 35 matrices. This kind of immobilization b eads may become unstable if phosphate is 
present or even sequester phosphate salts (Moreno-Garrido, 2008; Olguin, 2012). 
Compared with natural polymers, synthetic polymers are more stable during 
long-term operation and not easy to be de graded by microbes. However, natural 
polymers are less hazardous during the production process and higher in diffusivity 
(de-Bashan and Bashan, 2010). The immobiliz ed microalgae systems are used for 
nutrient removal and heavy metal removal (Table 4.1).

Attached algal culture systems as passive  immobilization methods are intended to 
promote the growth of microalgae or forma tion of biofilms on the surface of carriers 
such as polystyrene foam thus to simplify the cell harvest (Zhang and Hu, 2012). 
Guzzon et al. (2008) devel oped a phototrophic biofilm reactor with polycarbonate 
slides for phosphorus removal and up to 112 mg/m2/d maximal P removal rate was 
achieved. A system where microalgae attached onto fiber-bundle carrier was used to 
treat secondary wastewater wi th the HRT of 2 days (He and Xue, 2010). The algal turf 
scrubbing (ATS) system is designed to let filamentous algae grow on a turf scrubber 
(screen) to reduce the harvesting cost. Th e yearly mean of algal production was 35 36 g/m2/d and the yearly mean rem oval rates of N and P were 1. 1 ± 0.5 and 0.7 ± 0.2 
g/m2/d, respectively (Adey et al., 2011). A tw in-layer system was used to immobilize 
Chlorella vulgaris  and Scenedesmus rubescens  by self-adhesion on a wet, 
microporous and ultrathin subs trate layer to remove nitr ogen and phosphorus. This 
novel system could keep 100% immobilization efficiency and the removal efficiencies 
of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate were more  than 90% within 9 days (Shi et al., 
2007). 
4.5 Other methods 
Flotation is a harvest method to make micr oalgae cells to float on the surface of the 
medium with dispersed micro-air bubbles  and removed as scum (Brennan and 
Owende, 2009). A commonly used flotation method in wastewater treatment for algae 
removal is dissolved air flotation (DAF) (C hristenson and Sims, 2011). In this system, 
an air compressor is used to supply fine  bubbles to supersaturate flotation water 
(Wiley et al., 2009). The microalgae cells ar e adhered by bubbles resulting in floating 
to the surface (Wiley et al., 2009). Some flo cculants are added to improve the harvest 
efficiency (Christenson and Sims, 2011) . It is energy-intensive and causes 
downstream processing of algae (Greenwe ll et al., 2010; Henderson et al., 2008; 
Wiley et al., 2009). An alternative method is to use surfactants to replace a 
compressor and saturator to  create small bubbles for th e algal cells to adhere 
(Henderson et al., 2008; Wiley et al., 2009). And the removal efficiency is dependent 
on the efficiency of the surfactants adsorb ed at the bubble interface (Henderson et al., 
2008).  
Besides, the algae cell can be concentrated and harvested by the motion of 
dispersed microalgae in an electric field (Christenson and Sims, 2011). This harvest 
method is based on the electrophoresis phenom enon and the negative charge of algal 
cells. The energy need is at least 0.3 KWh/m3 (Poelman et al., 1997). The high power 
investment together with the expensive electrode is still the obstacle of this 
technology (Uduman et al., 2010).

Process factors in algal-bacterial systems 
Some abiotic (temperature, pH, disso lved oxygen, light, mixing, nitrogen and 
phosphorus concentration and ratios) and bi otic (microalgal sp ecies, relationship 
between microalgae and bacteria, inoculum co ncentration) factors affect the growth 
rates and chemical composition of microalgae leading to differences in the wastewater 
treatment performances. Therefore, a deep understanding of these important factors is 
necessary for overall optimization. 
5.1 Abiotic factors 
5.1.1 Temperature 
The optimum temperature for microalgae gr owth usually varies with the species 
and also depends on the acclimated environment (Cho et al., 2007). Below the 
optimum temperature, microalgal growth ra tes would increase with  an increase of 
temperature. Above the optimum temperat ure, microalgal growth rates would 
decrease with increasing temperature. Generally, temperatur es higher than 35 °C are 
lethal for some algal species while temperatures below 16 °C would slow down algal 
growth unless isolated from extreme envir onments. The previous study revealed that 
the green microalgae of Chlorella  species show good adap tation capacities for 
low-temperature conditions and it c ould even sustain photosynthetic oxygen 
production at the temperature nearly as lo w as freezing (Oswald and Gotaas, 1957). In 
the meantime, Chlorella  also showed better tolerance to high temperature (Hanagata 
et al., 1992). For the extreme microalgae such  as sea-ice microalgae or microalgae in 
polar regions, a special adaptive mechanism to protect against freezing is developed 
in order to survive at freezing temperatur e and seasonal changes of light intensity 
(Gomez et al., 2009; Rochet et al., 1985). 
  Besides, for the consortium formed by va rious microalgae and bacteria species, the 
influence of the temperature is the results of all microorganisms. It was reported that 
the removal efficiency doubled when increasing the temperature from 25 °C to 30 °C 
with a symbiotic culture constituted of Chlorella. sorokiniana  and Ralstonia. 
basilensis  (Munoz et al., 2004).  
 42 5.1.2 pH 
Freshwater microalgae species have a tolerance to both acidic and alkaline pH to 
adapt to widely fluctuating pH levels where they live and many marine microalgae 
species are unlikely to grow in extr eme pH environments (such as pH ≥10) due to the 
well regulated pH of sea water (Goldman et  al., 1982). Different microalgae species 
could grow at similar pH ranges but with  a different optimum pH (Hoham et al., 
2007). The optimum pH of Dunaliella  sp. and D. salina  DCCBC2 is 8.0, 7.0 of  
Chlorella sp. and 7.2 of Synechocystis  sp.(Kim et al., 2012; Martinez et al., 2011). 
  Besides, pH does not only affect the gr owth of microalgae but  also modify the 
CO 2/HCO 3-/CO 32-, NH 3/NH 4+ equilibria and phosphorus and heavy metal availability 
(Laliberte et al., 1994; Munoz and Guieysse, 2006). Furthermore, pH is important for 
processes of abotic nutrient removal as at a pH of 9 to 11 some of the inlet nitrogen 
and phosphorus are removed via ammonia st ripping and orthophos phate precipitation 
(Munoz, 2005; Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995; Zhang et al., 2012). Changes in pH 
levels influence the bacteria l activity in algae-bacter ia culture. In addition, as 
discussed in chapter 4.2, the increase in pH would promot e flocculation thus offering 
benefits for the biomass separation. 
  During wastewater treatment with algae- bacteria-based systems, several factors 
may influence the pH. Microalgal CO 2 uptake and nitrate uptake could cause an 
alkalinity concomitant (Gutzei t et al., 2005; Perez-Garcia et  al., 2011). Nitrification 
process and ammonium consumption w ould result in pH decrease due to H+ releasing 
(Gonzalez et al., 2008a; Li et  al., 2010a). And the finial pH is the result of a 
combination of the above factors in the systems.  
  The inorganic/organic carbon ratio of the treated wastewater is also related to pH 
changes in the culture. A high inorganic/or ganic carbon ratio would lead to high pH, 
and vice versa (Hende et al., 2011). Similar results were observed in paper III and IV 
as well. A high pH (above 9) was observed after the first few days for tertiary 
treatment and the tertiary influent is hi gh in inorganic/organi c carbon ratio. But in 
papers I and II, the maximum pH remained around 8 in the reactors fed with 
pretreated municipal wastewater w ith low inorganic/organic carbon ratio. 
5.1.3 Dissolved oxygen (DO) 
Dissolved oxygen concentra tion increases during algal photosynthesis, as the 
growth of 1 g of microalgal cells is  accompanied by the release of 1.587 g of 
dissolved molecular oxygen (Oswald and Gotaas, 1957). The generated oxygen would 43 be consumed immediately by heterotrophic b acteria or heterotrophic microalgae for 
organic carbon degradation. And the finial DO levels are the combined results of 
oxygen generation and consumption. For instance, in the experiments of Papers I and 
II, the DO concentration was as low as a pproximately 0 mg/l afte r starting the batch 
test indicating that the generated oxygen was completely used for organic carbon 
mineralization. DO increased immediately to around 5 mg/l as soon as the organic 
carbon source was eliminated. In Papers  III and IV , above 15 mg/l of DO was 
observed after beginning the te st and this high DO value remains stable till the end of 
the test for tertiary wastewater treatmen t. The possible reasons for this phenomenon 
might be that the low organic carbon concen tration in the tertiary  influent could not 
support the intensive growth of heterotrophic microorganisms thus resulted in the low 
oxygen consumption.  
It is also common to find O 2 supersaturation up to 40 0% in enclosed algal 
cultivation photobioreactors (Munoz and Guieysse, 2006) . Similarly, dissolved 
oxygen supersaturation on the top water la yers of algal ponds can reach between 
300% and 400% on warm sunny afternoons in the tropical regions (Tadesse et al., 
2004). High dissolved oxygen levels can i nhibit photosynthesis a nd this byproduct of 
microalgal photosynthesis must be remove d in order to prevent photo-oxidative 
damage thus decrease the treatment effici ency (Christenson and Sims, 2011; Munoz, 
2005). Gas-liquid contactor reactors such as ro tation biological contactors are used to 
realize both carbon dioxide transfer and oxygen releas e if properly designed 
(Christenson and Sims, 2011).  
5.1.4 Light 
Among the abiotic factors affecting the auto trophic growth of mi croalgae, light is 
described as one of the most important f actors because the photosynthesis is totally 
light powered. A typical light in tensity curve for algal growth  rate can be divided into 
three periods as shown in Figure 5.1 (Munoz, 2005; Sorokin and Krauss, 1958). I. 
Period of increase: The growth rates rise with the increase in light intensity. II. Light 
independent or plateau period: When the light intensity reaches a certain value 
(saturation light intensity), th e growth rates remain stable with the increase in light 
intensity. III. Period of decrea se: The additional light is no t utilized and the growth 
rates declines with the increase in light intensit y due to photoinhibition.  44 Light intensityGrowth rateⅠ ⅡⅢ
 
Fig.5.1 Typical light intensity curve for algal growth rate 
  The characteristics of th is curve (Fig. 5.1) are strongl y dependent on the microalgal 
species, the concentration of microalgae a nd other environmental factors such as 
temperature, nutrient supply and CO 2 concentration (Munoz and Guieysse, 2006; 
Sorokin and Krauss, 1958). Temperature is of primary importance among the 
environmental factors and the total different trends of light intensity curves for algal 
growth rates were shown for the same species under 25 °C and 39 °C (Sorokin and 
Krauss, 1958). Each microalgae has a uni que light saturation point but normally 
within 200-400 µE/m2/s (Cheirsilp and Torpee, 2012;  Munoz, 2005). The saturation 
light intensity would decrease at high micr oalgal concentration as high algal cell 
densities could lead to the mutual shading within the cells thus inhibit the growth 
(Guieysse et al., 2002).  
  Sunlight intensity is fluctuant with th e seasonal change and during daytime. The 
hydraulic retention time (HRT) needs to be  adjusted during the year in order to 
stabilize the system performa nces (Garcia et al., 2000; Ta desse et al., 2004). Besides, 
natural sunlight is peri odically absent and this diurnal cycle also  varies during the year. 
The photosynthesis and pollutant removal w ould stop once light is  not available and 
no leak of phosphorus occurs during darkness (Azad and Borchard, 1970; Munoz and 
Guieysse, 2006). As shown in Paper III, there was no difference of nutrient removal 
efficiencies with whole day illumination and 12 h light/12 h darkness (L/D) per day. 
The algal biomass generation rate with 24 h illumination (9.38±0.1 g/m2/d) was only 
1.87 g/m2/d higher than that of 12/12 (L/D) il lumination due to the natural selection 
and long-term adaptation. 
 45 5.1.5 Mixing 
  Mixing may affect the microalgal grow th in several important ways. First, it 
provides the microalgal cells intermittent cont act with the light, thereby increasing the 
available light utilization efficiency  (Oswald and Gotaas, 1957). Second, it may 
enhance the contact between the algal ce lls and nutrients and limits nutritional 
gradients in the cultivati on medium (Azad and Borchar d, 1970; Munoz, 2005). Third, 
it also helps the CO 2 transfer and O 2 release into atmosphere. Fourth, it keeps all the 
microalgal cells suspension and avoids the formation of anaerobi c zones and further 
anaerobic decomposition (Munoz and Gu ieysse, 2006). Too much mixing would 
cause cell damage from shear stress and increase the operation stress due to the 
intensive energy requirement. On the ot her hand, low mixing velocity may have 
adverse effects on algal growth. 
  Several types of mixing equipments are used in algae-based wastewater treatment 
technologies. Paddle wheels as low cost mixing devices are commonly used in open 
ponds (Oswald and Gotaas, 1957). But the en ergy required in a paddle wheel-driven 
system could be reduced by as much as 80%  with an airlift-driven raceway reactor 
(Ketheesan and Nirmalakhandan, 2011). Previous studies also  indicate that microalgal 
productivity would increase up to 75% wh en replacing pump by airlift systems 
(Gudin and Chaumont, 1991; Munoz and Guie ysse, 2006). Rotary-shaker or magnetic 
stirrers are always used in lab-scale batc h test (Guieysse et al., 2002). In Paper IV , it 
was shown that the mixing ve locity of 300 rpm (re volutions per minut e) could realize 
a better nutrient removal efficiency and hi gher algal growth rate s compared with 100 
rpm. 
5.1.6 The concentration and ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus 
Nitrogen is the most important nutrient for algal biomass production (Richmond, 
2004). The nitrogen content of the algal biomass is around 9.1% of the dry weight of 
microalgae and it varies between differen t algal species and also depends on the 
nutrients supply and availability (O swald and Gotaas, 1957; Richmond, 2004). 
Phosphorus dose not normally exceed 1.5% of th e dry weight of microalgae which is 
an essential element for microalgae for biosynthesis of nucleic acids, and supports 
energy transfer (Richmond, 2004). It rarely be comes a limiting factor for algal growth 
in municipal wastewater (Oswald and Gotaas, 1957). The N and P contents in 
municipal wastewater are ar ound 20-85 mg N/l and 4-16 mg P/l respectively, which is 
adequate to support the growth of most of  the microalgae (Christenson and Sims, 46 2011; Olguin, 2012).  
  N/P ratios ranging from 6.8-10 are considered optimal for microalgal growth 
(Olguin, 2012). Chevalier and de la Noue ( 1985a) pointed that th e optimal N/P ratio 
for maximum nutrient uptake was 30. Wang and Lan  (2011) indicated that for the 
green alga Neochloris oleoabundans , N removal was sensitive to N/P ratios and P 
removal was independent of N/P ratios when N:P was below 30. Besides, free 
ammonia would inhibit the photosynthesis of  most microalgal strains due to the 
uncoupling effect of ammonia on photosynthetic  processes in isolated chloroplasts 
(Crofts et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2011). Hi gh ammonium concentration combined with 
high pH (above 9) could promote the free ammonia stripping thus  inhibit the algal 
growth.  
5.2 Biotic factors 
5.2.1 Microalgae species selection 
Many different microalgae species have been se lected and tested for their potentials in 
wastewater treatment performance, microa lgal biomass production or lipid content 
under various experimental conditions (Table 5.1). However, these results are difficult 
to compare as they are obtained under diff erent operation conditions or with various 
bioreactors configurations. Among the different algae, Chlorella , Chlamydomonas 
and Nitzschia  seem to be the preferred specie s of microalgae due to their good 
tolerance of different environmental c onditions (Godos et al., 2009). Oswald (2003) 
showed that Chlorella , Scenedesmus  and Micractinium  were dominant algal species in 
algae wastewater treatment ponds, and species of Euglena , Chlamydomonas  and 
Oscillatoria  may occur in ponds with excessive loadings or long residence times, 
indicating that these 6 species may play important roles during wastewater treatment. 
Especially, Chlorella  is viewed as indigenous speci es usually found in wastewater 
treatment plants (Olguin, 2012).  
   de Godos et al. (2010) co mpared two green microalgae ( Scenedesmus obliquus  
and Chlorella sorokiniana ), one cyanobacterium ( Spirulina platensis ), one 
euglenophyta ( Euglena viridis ) and two microalgae consortia isolated from a swine 
manure stabilization pond according to the degradation efficiency of piggery 
wastewater (de Godos et al., 2010). Based on the comparison of the above-mentioned 
6 algae, it was indicated that C. sorokiniana  and E. viridis  had better removal 
performance for piggery wa stewater treatment and C. sorokiniana  showed the highest 
ammonia tolerance (de Godos  et al., 2010). A mixed al gal culture composed of 47 Chlorella vulgaris  and Scenedesums obliquus  could reach a nitrogen elimination 
capacity of 26 mg N/l/d (Gonzal ez-Fernandez et al., 2011). Z hou et al. (2011) selected 
17 top-performing algal strains for lip id accumulation from 60 algae-like 
microorganisms collected from different sa mpling sites in Minnesota. And these 17 
strains were identified as Chlorella  sp., Heynigia  sp., Hindakia  sp., Micractinium  sp. 
and Scenedesmus  sp. A mixed algal culture dominated by Chlorella , Micractinium  and 
Actinastrum  had a maximum lipid productivity of 24 mg/l/d with peak lipid contents 
ranging from 14-29% during primary clarif ier effluent treatment and over 99% 
removal of N and P were achieved in 3 HRT (Woertz et al., 2009). In Paper I, a mixed 
algal culture obtained from the wall of the s econdary clarifier of wastewater treatment 
plant was used. The maximum removal rate s of TKN and P were 3.8 mg N/l/d and 
0.35 mg P/l/d and average biomass productivity was 10.9 g/m2/d. As presented in 
Paper III, three green microalgae ( Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Chlorella vulgaris  and 
Scenedesmus  rubescens ) showed better N and P remova l rates and settleabilities over 
the cyanobacteria ( Phormidium sp.).  
  Normally, the ideal algal strains for wastewater treatment and biofuel production 
should: (1) have high lipid productivity and co ntent; (2) have high tolerance to a wide 
range in environmental changes such as te mperature, illumination, etc; (3) have a 
good settleability to harvest; (4) have a rapid growth capacity; (5) be  easy to cultivate; 
(6) have a high ammonia tolerance; (7) have high O 2 generation rates and high CO 2 
sinking capacity; (8) be able to dominate in  open system; (9) have a good tolerance to 
shear stresses (10) have good tolerance to toxic pollutants (Brennan and Owende, 
2009). However, no known algal strains could satisfy all these requirements and the 
selection of appropriate alg ae strains is heavily dependent on the aim of the project. 
  Future use of genome technology woul d develop genetically modified algae to 
enhance the algal function and thus to realize the overall optimization. The changes of 
the size of microalgal antenna by molecu lar tools could increase the microalgal 
photosynthetic rates and biom ass productivity (Munoz, 2005).

5.2.2 Microalgal-bacterial symbiotic system 
In nature, aerobic or anaerobic bacteria  are always found in algal habitats, 
indicating the symbiotic relationship between  microalgae and bacteria (Fukami et al., 
1997; Subashchandrabose et al., 2011). Duri ng wastewater treatment, the symbiotic 
relationship between microalga and bacteria is also the base to complete the treatment. 
Their mutual interactions include both positive roles such as O 2 and CO 2 supply, and 
also negative mutual influence (Table 5.2) . The special environment with high oxygen 
concentration and high pH cr eated during algal photosynthe sis growth could impede 
the bacterial growth (Schumacher and Sekoulov, 2003). Algae would also excrete 
some anti-bacterial substances which are es pecially toxic to gram-positive bacteria 
(Davies-Colley et al., 1999; Schumacher a nd Sekoulov, 2003). Certain bacteria such 
as Azospirillum  brasilense  strain Cd would excrete vitamins or algal 
growth-promoting substances which are used  as “helper” for microalgal growth 
(de-Bashan et al., 2004; Fukami et al ., 1997). However, two aerobic bacteria 
(Pseudomonas diminuta  and P . vesicularis ) can promote algal growth by reducing the 
photosynthetic oxygen tension within the micr oenvironment of the algal cells rather 
than releasing any growth promoting subs tance (Mouget et al.,  1995). It can be 
concluded from the above discussions that th e selection of suitable  algae and bacteria 
species to form a powerful algal-bacterial cu lture is of great im portance for achieving 
good wastewater treatment performance.

 Stimulative effects  
  Many special unicellular microalgae and pollutant-specific degr ading bacteria are 
used to treat municipal or toxic wastew ater. But in open or outdoor systems, the 
mixed culture or natural-selected culture is  always expected to suffer from changing 50 environmental conditions. It was reported that the dominant al gal species changed 
during wastewater treatment process (Godos et  al., 2009). In Paper I,  it is indicated 
that the main bacteria community of the wastewater-borne and settleable 
algal-bacterial culture were Flavobacteria , Gammaproteobacteria , Bacteroidia  and 
Betaproteobacteria . In Paper II, it is shown that the bacterial compositions were 
diverse in reactors inoculated with differ ent algae/sludge ratios, which showed that 
different dominant bacteria were enri ched and played important roles during 
wastewater treatment in algal- bacterial cultures with different inoculum ratios. To the 
best of our knowledge, these parts of wo rks are the first investigation in the 
identifications of the dominating bacteria in  wastewater-borne alga l-bacterial systems. 
5.2.3 Inoculum concentration 
The proper inoculum concentration optim izes the removal process and ensures 
good removal efficiencies. Within certain concentrations, the removal performance 
improved with the increase of the initial algal concentration. After reaching certain 
concentrations, further increase of the alga l inoculum concentration had no influence 
on the nutrient uptake rates. The possible explanation may be that about the same 
number of algae is actually working in these systems (C hevalier and de la Noue, 
1985a). And once a critical microalgal dens ity is reached, the processes are limited by 
the available light supply and the self -shading phenomenon, thus resulting in the 
collapse of the systems (Guieysse et al., 2002). Paper IV shown that different 
algae/bacteria inoculum ratios  led to different treatment efficiencies which indicated 
that proper inoculum strategy was vita l for the treatment performance.

Conclusions 
This thesis has mainly focused on the cultivation of settleable algal-bacterial 
culture, improvement of municipal wastew ater treatment efficiency and better 
understanding of these algal-bacterial systems including N, P mass balance and 
bacterial community compositions. The major contributions of this thesis work are 
summarized as below: 
 In Paper I, an algal-bacterial culture, cultivated from algae from the second 
clarifier of Suderburg wastewater trea tment plant (Germany) and wastewater 
bacteria with alternate mixing and non-mixing strategy, were used for 
municipal wastewater treatment and to  accumulate biomass simultaneously. 
The algal-bacterial culture showed good settle ablility, resulting in a reduction 
of total suspended solids (TSS) from initially 1.84 to 0.016 g/l within 20 min. 
The average removal efficiencies of  COD, TKN and phosphate were 98.2 ± 
1.3%, 88.3 ± 1.6% and 64.8 ± 1.0% within 8 days, respectively. The average 
TN and P removal rates were 2.4 mg N/l/d and 0.35 mg P/l/d. The average 
biomass productivity was 10.9 ± 1.1 g/m2·d. Accumulation into biomass was 
identified as the main nitrogen an d phosphorus removal mechanism, which 
accounted for around 44.9 ± 0.4% and 61.6 ± 0.5% of total inlet nitrogen and 
phosphorus, respectively. Microscopic anal ysis showed the ma in algae species 
in the bioreactor were filamentous blue -green algae. Furthermore, microbial 
community analysis revealed that the main bacteria present in the 
photobioreactor were consortia with  sequences similar to those of 
Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Betaproteobacteria .  
 In Paper II, aerobic activated sludge was used as bacterial inoculum in 
algal-bacterial culture to enhance the settleability. The effects of different 
algae/sludge inoculation ra tios were investig ated in terms of  carbon, nutrients 
removal and biomass settleability. Th e COD removal efficiency was above 
91.2% for the four tested al gae/sludge inoculation ratios  (10:1, 5:1, 1:1 and 1:5) 
within 8 days. To the contrary, nutri ent removal was enhanced with proper 
inoculation ratios. The highest nitroge n and phosphorus removal efficiencies 58 were observed with a 5:1 (algae/slu dge) culture (91.0 ± 7.0% and 93.5 ± 2.5%, 
respectively) within 10 days, which was 5% - 40% higher and 2 - 4 days faster 
than those of other cultures with 10: 1, 1:1 or 1:5 inoculation ratio. Biomass 
incorporation was identified as the ma in nitrogen removal mechanism for 5:1 
and 1:1 cultures, which accounted for 60.0 ± 0.3% and 41.6 ± 0.5% of inlet 
nitrogen. NH 4+ was mainly oxidized to NO 2- other than biomass uptake at 
ratios of 1:5 and 10:1, which accounted for 41.4 ± 1.6% and 26.8 ± 0.9% of 
inlet nitrogen. Biomass uptake was the main P removal mechanism. The 
settleability of algae biomass was enha nced after inocula ting with sludge. The 
culture with 1:5 algae/sl udge showed the best set tleability, resulting in 
reduction of total suspended solids from 1.64 ± 0.02 to 0.05 ± 0.02 g/l in 30 
min followed by cultures with 1:1 and 5: 1, which took 36 and 42 min to settle 
down. Furthermore, microbial community an alysis revealed that the bacterial 
communities were varying with different algae and activated sludge 
inoculation ratios.  
 In Paper III, four common used microa lgae species were compared concerning 
their settleability, nutrient removal cap acity and biomass productivity. After 
one month of training, except cyanobacteria Phormidium  sp., three green 
microalgae species, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Chlorella vulgaris  and 
Scenedesmus  rubescens  showed good settleability,  from initially 508.3 ± 2.5, 
510.8 ± 1.5 and 522.4 ± 2.5 FTU (Formazin Turbidity Unit) to 2.76 ± 2.5, 1.84 
± 1.5 and 4.79 ± 2.5 FTU after one hour of sedimentation. The N and P 
removal efficiency was all above 99% w ithin 7, 4, 6 and 6 days for N and 4, 2, 
3 and 4 days for P, resulting in N removal rates of 3.66 ± 0.17, 6.39 ± 0.20, 
4.39 ± 0.06 and 4.31 ± 0.18 mg N/l/d and P removal rates of 0.56 ± 0.07, 0.89 
± 0.05, 0.76 ± 0.09 and 0.60 ± 0.05 mg P/l/d for Phormidium  sp., 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus  rubescens , 
respectively. Phormidium  sp. had the lowest algal biomass productivity (2.71 
± 0.7 g/m2/d) and the other three green microalgae showed higher and similar 
algal biomass productivity (6 g/m2/d). More than 92.9%, 89.4%, 90.1% and 
88.8% of removed nitrogen was assim ilated into algal biomass and 96.7%, 
96.1%, 96.9% and 97.9% of removed PO 43- -P was mainly uptaken by algae 
and partly precipitated when  the pH was above 9 for Phormidium  sp., 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus  rubescens , 
respectively.  59  In Paper IV , a mixed algal culture, composed of three unicellular green 
microalgae ( Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus  
rubescens ) selected according to the results of Paper III, was  cultivated for 
nutrient removal and algal biomass accumulation simultaneously. The  mixed 
algal culture showed higher nutrient removal rates than  those of the individual 
microalgae  species. The influences of biotic (algal inoculum concentration) 
and abiotic factors (illumination cycle,  mixing velocity and nutrient strength) 
on the treatment efficiency, biomass generation and settleability  were 
investigated. Dark cond ition led to poor nutrient removal efficiency. No 
significant difference in  the N, P removal and biom ass settleability between 
continuous and alternate illumination was  observed, but a higher biomass 
generation capability for the continuous illumination was obtained  (9.38 ± 0.1 
g/m2/d). Different mixing velocity led to similar phosphorus removal 
efficiencies (above  98%) with different retention time (6, 10 and 11 days for 
300, 100 and 0 rpm, respectively). The  reactor with 300 rp m had the best N 
removal capability, and nitrification plays the important role in  nitrogen 
removal for the other two reactors with  0 and 100 rpm. For the low strength 
wastewater (around NH 4+ -N: 45.2 mg/l; PO 43- -P: 3.7 mg/l), the  N and P 
removal efficiencies were above 98% for all the tested algal inoculum 
concentrations but with  different retention time, resulting in the daily N 
removal rate of 5.4 ± 0.2, 9.1 ± 0.3 and 10.8 ± 0.3 mg/l/d  and P removal rate of 
0.57 ± 0.03, 0.56 ± 0.03 and 0.72 ± 0.05 mg/l/d  for reactors with the algal 
inoculum  concentration of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/l, respectively. Low nutrient 
removal efficiency and poor biomass settleability were obtained for high 
strength wastewater (around NH 4+ -N: 90.2 mg/l; PO 43- -P: 11.5 mg/l).  
Overall, the thesis has explored a specific  cultivation strategy (alternate mixing and 
non-mixing strategy) to train and enhance the settleability of microalgae-based 
systems. Besides, activated sludge can be us ed as bacterial inoc ulum to improve the 
settleability of biomass for this algal-bacterial system. It was found that the mixing 
velocity of 300 rpm could offer good remova l performance for ter tiary treatment and 
light-cycle (full-day light or 12 h light/12 h darkness) had slight influence on the 
removal efficiencies. Mixed algal culture can  enhance the treatment performance over 
individual algae species. This study e xplores a better understanding of an 
algal-bacterial system through analyzing the bacterial community compositions and 
offers new options to solve the harves ting problems. Although the good settleability 
and removal performance could be realized in the lab-scale test, further large-scale 60 and long-term investigation with these settl eable algae-based systems is still needed. 
Future research efforts should go towa rds investigating the biogas and biofuel 
generation potentials of the settleable alga l biomass accumulated during treatment to 
evaluate and optimize the whole process.

A wastewater-born and settleable algal-bacterial culture, cultivated in a stirred tank pho-
tobioreactor under lab conditions, was used to remove the carbon and nutrients in
municipal wastewater and accumulate biomass simultaneously. The algal-bacterial
culture showed good settleable property and could totally settle down over 20 min,
resulting in a reduction of total suspended solids from an initial 1.84 to 0.016 g/l. The
average removal efﬁciencies of chemical oxygen demand, total kjeldahl nitrogen and
phosphate were 98.2 /C61.3%, 88.3 /C61.6% and 64.8 /C61.0% within 8 days, respectively, while
the average biomass productivity was 10.9 /C61.1 g/m2$d. Accumulation into biomass,
identiﬁed as the main nitrogen and phosphorus removal mechanism, accounted for
44.9 /C60.4% and 61.6 /C60.5% of total inlet nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. Micro-
scopic analysis showed the main algae species in the bioreactor were ﬁlamentous blue-
green algae. Furthermore, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rDNA gene
sequencing revealed that the main bacteria present in the photobioreactor were consortia
with sequences similar to those of Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Beta-
proteobacteria . This study explores a better understanding of an algae-bacteria system and
offers new information on further usage of biomass accumulated during treatment.

1. Introduction
The concept of algal-bacterial culture as an engineered system
in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment has experi-
enced increased momentum over the past few years ( Bordel
et al., 2009; de-Bashan et al., 2002; Garcia et al., 2000; Gutzeit
et al., 2005; Medina and Neis, 2007; Munoz et al., 2005 ). It is
especially favorable in regions with year-round high solar
radiation and temperature as the removal is an entirely
natural process. When illuminated, algae produce oxygen that
can be used by aerobic bacteria to biodegrade pollutantswhilst, in return, they consume the carbon dioxide released
from bacterial respiration ( Oswald, 1988 ), which provides
a cheaper and safer alternative to mechanical aeration and
contributes to CO 2mitigation ( Guieysse et al., 2002; Munoz
and Guieysse, 2006 ).
Another advantage of this technology is that more nitrogen
and phosphorus could accumulate into the algal and bacterial
biomass during the removal process. When using a bacterial
system to treat acetonitrile (1 g/l), only 26% N eNHþ
4was
assimilated into biomass. Under the same conditions using
algal-bacterial culture, 53% N eNHþ
4was assimilated into algae

that, under optimal operating conditions (e.g., sufﬁcient light
intensity and a proper bioreactor conﬁguration), almost all the
available ammonia nitrogen appeared in the form of algal cell
material ( Oswald and Gotass, 1957 ). All the above gives algal-
bacterial biomass, accumulated during wastewater treat-
ment, the potential to be used as a fertilizer in agriculture
(Benemann et al., 1977; Mulbry et al., 2005 ).
The major limitation of the exploitation of this technology
is the requirement for cost-effective biomass harvesting
techniques. A technical separation unit consisting of ﬁltration
or centrifugation has to be applied ( Mohn, 1988 ), but this will
raise the operation cost. Adding chemicals such as Ca2þor
slaked lime will result in secondary pollutants ( Imase et al.,
2008; Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995 ). Using an immobilization
system is another possible solution ( Mallick, 2002; Moreno-
Garrido, 2008 ), but all media are costly and inefﬁcient over
a long operation time. Therefore, a more effective biomass
harvesting strategy such as a settleable algae-bacteria system
is required.
The identiﬁcation and biometry of the dominant algal
species in the algal-bacterial culture were well-studied in
previous works ( Godos et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 2000; Oswald,
2003 ), but little information was available about the bacterial
community involved in this symbiotic system. Investigation of
the microbial composition and their functionalities could
provide some insights into the biological catalytic and symbi-
otic mechanisms. Moreover, the puriﬁcation capacity could
potentially be improved by addressing microbial constraints.
In this study, for the ﬁrst time, a settleable algal-bacterial
culture was cultivated from domestic wastewater, and its
treatment efﬁciencies, biomass generation, N and P accumu-
lation processes and microbial diversity were investigated.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Settleable algal-bacterial culture enrichment
The algae inoculum was obtained from the second clariﬁer wall
of the Suderburg municipal wastewater treatment plant
(County of Uelzen, Lower Saxony, Germany). The collected algae
solution (exposure to bacteria was unavoidable) was ﬁrstly
settled down for 1 h, and then 30 g (wet weight) of settled solid
was used as algae inoculum for algal-bacterial culture enrich-
ment. The wastewater collected from the second clariﬁer at the
same site was used as medium, and 600 ml pretreated waste-
water collected from the same plant (after preliminary
screening, grit removal and primary sedimentation process)was used as bacterial inoculum and nutrient supply. The
settleable algal-bacterial culture was cultivated under labora-
tory conditions at around 19/C14C. The stirred tank photo-
bioreactor (for culture enrichment) was made of transparent
PVC 40 cm in depth and 29 cm in diameter. The total volume of
the medium in the reactor was 14 l (approx. 25 cm in depth).
Constant mixing was maintained using a magnetic stirring bar
(100 rpm) to avoid algae sedimentation. Two compact ﬂuores-
cent lamps (Sylvania, F20W/860/E27) were used to irradiate the
tank with about 360 mEs/C01m/C02(measured at the top of the liquid
surface) for a period of 12 h per day. In order to cultivate the
settleable algal-bacterial culture, the mixing procedure was
stopped every 23 h for 1 h and the ﬂoating biomass was dis-
carded with a screen (0.5 mm). 600 ml pretreated wastewater
was exchanged after sedimentation every 3 days to maintain
a nutrient supply. After one month of cultivation, dark green
and pea green microalgae were visible and distributed evenly in
the reactor.
2.2. Experimental operation
The same laboratory-scale reactor system as in the cultivation
process was used for the batch mode. The pretreated waste-
water was used as feed for the reactor in the following
experiments, unless otherwise stated. The characterization of
the pretreated wastewater used in the different batches is
shown in Table 1 . Before starting the batch experiment, the
algal-bacterial biomass was allowed to settle by stopping the
stirrer for half an hour. At the end of each 8-days cycle, 12.5 l of
suspension was removed and replaced by fresh wastewater as
above. The irradiation device was the same as that for the
cultivation process. The photoperiod was a 12 h light-12 h
dark cycle. 150 ml samples for further analysis (see below)
were collected near the midway of the reactor with a pipe
every day, 4 h after starting the irradiation period.
2.3. Analytical procedures
The temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured
near the midway of the reactor by using a microprocessor oxi-
meter (Oxi 320/SET. WTW, Germany) coupled with an O 2sensor
(CellOx 325, WTW, Germany). pH was determined using a Cri-
son pH electrode (pH 197-S). Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD),
Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) and Total Suspended Solid (TSS)
were analyzed according to DIN 38409-H 41(44), DIN EN 25663-
H11 and DIN ISO 11465 ( DEV., 2002 ). NHþ

dissolved phosphorus ðPO3/C0

D I NE N1 4 8 4 - H 3( DEV., 2002 ). Before analysis of the above
parameters in liquid, samples were membrane ﬁltered
(0.45mm). To measure nitrogen or phosphorus in biomass, the
samples were ﬁrst divided into two identical parts. One part was
homogenized, while another part was ﬁltered to remove the
solids. Nitrogen or phosphorus in biomass was calculated as the
total nitrogen or phosphorus difference between the homoge-
nized samples and the ﬁltered samples. All the experiments
were performed in duplicate. An optical microscope (OLYMPUS
CHT, Japan) was used for morphological characterisation of
microalgae.
2.4. Community analysis
Bacteria of the algae-bacteria system were collected at the end
of each batch test by centrifugation at 10,000 rev min/C01for
10 min at 4/C14C. Each sample was washed twice with phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0). Genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp /C228
DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 51504) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rDNA
analysis were done as described previously ( Su et al., 2009;
Schauer et al., 2000 ). Dominant bands were sequenced (Mac-
rogen, the Netherlands). Sequences were subjected to Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and Ribosomal Database
Project (RDP) analysis ( Zhang et al., 2009 ). Phylogeny was
determined with the RDP classiﬁer and Sequmatch. The
sequences used here have been deposited in the GenBank
under the accession numbers HQ327478 eHQ327485.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Settleability of the algal-bacterial culture
The settleability of the cultivated algal-bacterial culture was
investigated and is shown in Fig. 1 .I ts h o w e dg o o ds e t t l e a b i l i t y ,as nearly all the algal-bacterial biomass settled to the bottom of
glass cylinder within 20 min, resulting in a reduction of TSS
from an initial 1.84 to 0.016 g/l. The corresponding sludge
settling ratio (SV %) was 12%, which also implied its good set-
tleability ( Sekine et al., 1984 ). Compared with an uncultivated
algal-bacterial culture, the good settleability of the system
might be due to the special cultivation strategy used in this
study. The alternate mixing and non-mixing operation in the
cultivation period promoted the selection of settleable algae
and bacteria, which provided an effective way to harvest algal-
bacterial biomass. The harvest technology of this settleable
system has three advantages over other algal-bacterial har-
vesting technologies ( Mohn, 1988; Imase et al., 2008; Nurdogan
and Oswald, 1995 ). First, the operating cost was greatly
reduced, as no extra energy (or equipment) was required.
Second, secondary pollutants were eliminated during opera-
tion and biomass harvest, as no extra chemicals were added.
Third, the settleability could be guaranteed during long-term
operation. The sedimentation was the characteristic of the
cultivated algal-bacterial culture and not dependent on any
immobilization medium which was inefﬁcient over long time
operation ( Mallick, 2002; Moreno-Garrido, 2008 ). A microscopic
photograph of the developed algal-bacterial ﬂocs is shown in
Fig. 2 .F r o m Fig. 2 A, it can be seen that the main species in the
bioreactor were ﬁlamentous blue-green algae. Fig. 2 B shows the
wastewater bacteria attached to the algae ﬁlaments, which
forms the cooperative system. Obviously, binding mechanisms
supporting the bio-ﬂocculation process led to the formation of
settleable biomass. There may be some factors responsible for
the settling process, such as the algae cell surface properties,
extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the content of
cations, which will inﬂuence the formation and the stability of
the settleable algal-bacterial biomass ( Gutzeit et al., 2005 ).
3.2. Carbon and nutrients removal in municipal
wastewater with algal-bacterial culture
3.2.1. Temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH
Changes in temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen during
operation were monitored to determine their effects on the
treatment process. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the culture temperature
Fig. 1 eSettleability of algal-bacterial biomass. (A) Initial completely mixed sample. (B) After 5 min of sedimentation. (C)
After 20 min of sedimentation.water research 45 (2011) 3351 e3358 3353was around 12/C14C (the same as outdoor temperature) at the
beginning of each batch test. It might be due to the fact that the
wastewater was added into the bioreactor immediately after
collection from the municipal wastewater plant. After that, the
temperature increased to room temperature and remained
stable until the end of each batch test.
Similarly, at the beginning of each batch test, the dissolved
oxygen concentration (DO) was the same as that of the pre-
treated wastewater. When starting the batch run, the DO
values dropped signiﬁcantly to around zero, which indicatedthat after initial consumption of the DO in the wastewater, the
O2released from the algal photosynthesis was almost
consumed by processes such as heterotrophic carbon oxida-
tion and nitriﬁcation. After three days, the oxygen concen-
tration increased gradually to around 2 mg/l and continued to
increase until it was around 5.5 mg/l (70% saturation) at the
end of each batch run ( Fig. 3 A).
No signiﬁcant variation in culture pH during the four
batches was detected in the system. Only a slight pH decrease
occurred due to the intensive nitriﬁcation over the ﬁrst ﬁve
days. After that, pH increased gradually to 8.4 (see Fig. 3 B).
There are several factors which may inﬂuence the culture pH,
such as micro-algal growth (pH increase as a result of CO 2
uptake), NHþ
4nitriﬁcation (pH decrease due to the release of
Hþ) and the excretion of acidic or basic metabolites from
organic matter biodegradation ( Gonzalez et al., 2008b ).
3.2.2. Elimination of organic carbon
As shown in Fig. 4 , the COD decreased with time and was
lower than 3 mg/l at the end of each batch test. The COD and
TOC removal efﬁciencies were around 98% and 75.2% for the
four batches, respectively ( Fig. 4 ). Both algae and bacteria were
able to use organic carbon through mixotrophic or hetero-
trophic metabolism ( Abeliovich and Weisman, 1978 ). It was
obvious that carbon sources were eliminated signiﬁcantly

with that of previous studies ( Gutzeit et al., 2005 ). The COD
and TOC removal were slow after the fourth day. There were
two possible reasons for this. First, the carbon source left in
the system was small after the fourth day. Second, the
remaining carbon may be some colloidal, slowly biodegrad-
able material. Usually, carbon was the limiting factor when
algae were cultured in sewage. However, algae may also
obtain CO 2from the air in an open system, when the amount
of carbon (inorganic and organic) in wastewater is inadequate
for algal photosynthesis ( Gonzalez et al., 2008a; Oswald, 1988 ).
3.2.3. Elimination of nitrogen
The inﬂuent nitrogen was mainly in the form of N eNHþ
4
(70e90%), followed by total organic nitrogen (10 e30%). Fig. 5 A
shows the TKN, N eNHþ
4removal and N eO/C0
3generation process.
NeNHþ
4removal efﬁciencies for all the four batches were nearly100%, while the TKN removal efﬁciency were slightly different,
ranging from 76.6% to 97.8% ( Fig. 5 A). The TKN removal efﬁ-
ciency in the last two batches was slightly lower compared with
that in the ﬁrst two batches. Obviously, there was still some
organic nitrogen (ON, the difference of TKN and N eNHþ
4)i nt h e
efﬂuent. The ON might be made of a small amount of insepa-
rable organic matter produced during algae growth and
wastewater treatment processes Oswald and Gotass, 1957 .
Additionally, N eNO 3/C0was always detected in the efﬂuent due
to incipient nitriﬁcation (around 5.2 mg/l). Nitrite was never
detected at the end of each batch run.
The nitrogen balance was also investigated for a better
understanding of nitrogen removal mechanisms. Based on total
nitrogen removal and biomass concentration (discussed later),
nitrogen assimilation into biomass accounted for approx.
52.9/C60.3%, 43.1 /C60.4%, 43.0 /C60.5% and 40.7 /C60.4% of the total
inlet nitrogen in the four batches, respectively ( Table 2 ). The
contribution of ammonia volatilization to total nitrogen
removal in this system could be negligible due to the low NHþ
4
concentrations and relatively low pH ( <8.5). Conversion into
nitrate only accounted for 20.0 /C60.2%, 18.3 /C60.3%, 19.0 /C60.1%
and 17.4 /C60.1% of total inlet nitrogen in the four batches,
respectively ( Table 2 ). The remaining missing nitrogen might be
due to denitriﬁcation processes, which could occur at DO below
2m g / l( Godos et al., 2009 ).
3.2.4. Elimination of phosphate
The time course of P ePO3/C0
4is shown in Fig. 5 B. The removal of
phosphate was a much slower process compared to that
observed for nitrogen, but the same general pattern was
apparent ( Fig. 5 B). The removal efﬁciencies of phosphate
ranging from 54.5% to 72.6% were observed. The relatively
slower and lower P ePO3/C0
4removal efﬁciencies, compared with
NeNHþ
4, were probably due to the fact that nitrogen was the
limiting nutrient, not phosphate, in this system. Previous
studies have shown that the optimal ratio for maximum
nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by algal-bacterial culture is
N:P¼30:1 ( Chevalier and de la Noue, 1985 ). However, the ratio
of nitrogen to phosphorus was lower than 3 in this study.
Similarly, the balance of phosphorus was also investigated.
Phosphorus accumulation into the biomass was still the main
mechanism in this system, which accounted for 62.6 /C60.5%,
66.6 /C60.4%, 50.1 /C60.6% and 67.1 /C60.5% of the total inlet
phosphorus for the four batches, respectively ( Table 2 ).
Phosphorus can be eliminated through both biotic phospho-
rous assimilation into the biomass and abiotic phosphorous
precipitation ( Godos et al., 2009 ).Nurdogan and Oswald (1995)
reported on abiotic P removal which took place mainly in the04812162024283236

system, the pH below 9 was not sufﬁcient to promote this
removal mechanism.
3.3. Biomass generation and nutrients accumulation
processes
3.3.1. Biomass generation during the operation
As shown in Fig. 6 A, the TSS increased during operation, from
0.6 g/l at the beginning to 1.84 g/l at the end. The mean
biomass generation rate was 10.9 /C61.1 g/m2d. These values
were lower than those reported by previous studies, in which
maximum biomass productivities of 27.7 g/m2d were
observed with 10 times diluted swine manure (2417 /C6481 mg
COD/l; 214 /C653 mg NHþ
4/l) during June and August in high rate
algae ponds (HRAPs) in Valladolid, Spain (average irradiations
7062 /C681 Wh/m2d) (de Godos et al., 2009 ). The lower avail-
ability of carbon and nitrogen in municipal wastewater
compared with diluted swine manure, together with the lower
irradiation, may be possible reasons for this.
Although there was continuous algal and bacterial growth
in the system during the treatment process, the removal
efﬁciencies of both carbon and nutrients and their general
patterns were quite similar for the four batches. One possible
reason for this might be that the further increased algae
concentration has less effect on the uptake rate, since the
nutrient uptake by algae was also determined by other factors(e.g., illumination conditions and the irradiated water surface
area of the reactor) ( Chevalier and de la Noue, 1985 ).
3.3.2. Nutrient accumulation processes
The accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in biomass
during the treatment process is shown in Fig. 6 B. The nitrogen
concentration in biomass increased from 27.8 to 32.6 mg/g, at
a rate of nearly 0.15 mg/g d. Meanwhile, the phosphorus
concentration in the biomass increased from 0.72 to 4.74 mg/g,
at a rate of 0.12 mg/g d. The most rapid accumulation period of
nitrogen and phosphorus occurred in the ﬁrst batch. After
that, the accumulation rates were much lower and the
amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in biomass was stable. It
has been reported that the biomass generated from a swine
manure removal process, ranging from 22.9 to 76.6 mg N/g
biomass and from 4.3 to 25.2 mg P/g biomass, had fertilizer
value to promote plant growth ( Mulbry et al., 2005; Mulbry
et al., 2006 ). The concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus
in biomass in this study were comparable to those of the
swine manure treatment system. However, it is worth noting
that the nutrient concentration in municipal wastewater is
much lower than that of swine manure, so it leaves room to
improve the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in the
settleable algal-bacterial culture.

The DGGE proﬁles of the bacteria community sampled from
the reactor at the end of each batch run as shown in Fig. 4 are
summarized in Fig. 7 . It was clear that the bacterial pop-
ulations changed with time and became stable after operation
through three batches ( Fig. 7 ). At the same time, bacteria
related to nutrient removal might have been enriched and
stable, as indicated by the high removal efﬁciency observed
along the successive tests, as shown in Fig. 4 andFig. 5 . Some
bacteria in the acclimatized bacteria consortium were not
present in the inoculum, suggesting that some new commu-
nities were enriched after operation. The above results also
indicate that the bacteria community in algal-bacterial culture
required time to acclimate to this commensalism system.
In order to provide greater insight into microbial ecology
and diversity, eight predominant species extracted from DGGE
bands were sequenced. Based on the 16S rDNA gene library
results ( Table 3 ), the acclimatized bacteria consortium was
predominated by Bacteroidia (50% of clones), followed by Fla-
vobacteria (25% of clones), Betaproteobacteria (12.5% of clones)
and Gammaproteobacteria (12.5% of clones). It has been
observed that Flavobacteria and Bacteroidetes phylotypes were
present in high numbers in ammonia-oxidizing processes
(Ducey et al., 2010; Nakano et al., 2008; Zang et al., 2008 ).
Bafana et al. (2007) also observed that a Gammaproteobacteria
(54%) phylotype was dominant in the acclimatized sludge of
wastewater treatment plants. It was noticed that the band 1, 3
and 5 were stronger than other bands during operation ( Fig. 7 ),
thus their respective microorganisms might play a very
important role in wastewater nutrient removal.
4. Conclusion
A settleable algal-bacterial culture, cultivated from waste-
water, was successfully used to treat municipal wastewater in
a stirred tank photobioreactor. The algal-bacterial culture
showed good settleability, while the total suspended solid
could be reduced to 0.016 g/l within 20 min sedimentation.
The average removal efﬁciencies of COD, TKN and phosphatewere 98.2 /C61.3%, 88.3 /C61.6% and 64.8 /C61.0% within 8 days,
respectively, while the average biomass productivity was
10.9/C61.1 g/m2$d. Biomass uptake was the main mechanism
for nutrient removal. The main algae species in the bioreactor
were ﬁlamentous blue-green algae, while the main bacteria
present in the photobioreactor were a consortium with
sequences similar to Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bac-
teroidia and Betaproteobacteria . This study provides new
insights into rapidly settleable algal-bacterial culture enrich-
ment strategies and supplements the information on micro-
bial ecology and diversity in algal-bacterial culture.

An algal–bacterial culture, composed of wastewater-born algae and activated sludge, was cultivated to
treat domestic wastewater and accumulate biomass simultaneously. The inﬂuence of algae and sludge
inoculation ratios on the treatment efﬁciency and the settleability of the accumulated biomass were
investigated. There was no signiﬁcant effect of the inoculation ratios on the chemical oxygen demand
removal. Comparatively, the nutrients removal and related mechanism were varied with different
inoculation ratios. The highest nitrogen and phosphorus removal efﬁciencies were observed with 5:1
(algae/sludge) culture (91.0 ± 7.0% and 93.5 ± 2.5%, respectively) within 10 days, which was 5–40% higher
and 2–4 days faster than those with other inoculation ratios. The biomass settleability was improved
with the assistance of sludge, and the 1:5 (algae/sludge) culture showed the best settleability. Further-
more, 16S rDNA gene analysis showed that the bacterial communities were varying with different algae
and sludge inoculation ratios and some speciﬁc bacteria were enriched during operation.

1. Introduction
Algal–bacterial culture biotechnology has received more atten-
tion in recent years, especially in the tropical and subtropical re-
gions, as an alternative biosystem for municipal and industrial
wastewater treatment ( Garcia et al., 2000; Godos et al., 2009;
Oswald, 2003 ). Under illuminated conditions, algae produce O 2
by photosynthesis, which is required by the bacteria to mineralize
organic matter, realizing simultaneously cost-efﬁcient aeration
(Guieysse et al., 2002 ). The CO 2released by the bacteria is then
consumed by algal photosynthesis, thereby mitigating greenhouse
gas emission ( Munoz and Guieysse, 2006; Munoz et al., 2003;
Oswald, 1988 ). In addition, nutrients such as ammonium and phos-
phate known as the main cause of water body eutrophication are
concomitantly eliminated by algal uptake ( Chevalier et al., 2000;
de Godos et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011a,b ). Moreover, the algal
photosynthesis favors the elimination of many pathogens and
viruses by increasing the temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen
concentration of the treated efﬂuent ( Munoz et al., 2003; Oswald,
1988 ). The most important thing is that the biomass harvested at
the end of treatment process is a new sustainable source of liquid
transport fuel or valuable products (e.g., biodiesel, drugs, fertilizer)
(Rittmann, 2008 ).The treatment process occurring in the algal–bacterial system
may therefore be said to result from a symbiosis of algae and bac-
teria. The initial algae and bacteria inoculum ratios may inﬂuence
the cooperation relationship and then result in different treatment
efﬁciencies. Guieysse et al. (2002) described that the initial Chlo-
rella sorokiniana and Ralstonia basilensis inoculation ratios have
great inﬂuences on the salicylate degradation efﬁciency in a closed
system. However, there are no relevant reports about the inﬂuence
of the initial composition and algae/bacteria inoculum ratios on the
municipal wastewater treatment, especially in an open system.
Besides, one of the hurdles of this technology is the harvest or
separation of the algal–bacterial biomass from the treated wastewa-
ter discharge ( Mallick, 2002; Nudogan and Oswald, 1995 ). The con-
ventional harvesting technologies, such as ﬁltration, centrifugation,
adding chemicals or using immobilization medium have their own
disadvantages such as the high operation costs, secondary contam-
ination and low efﬁciency for long-term operation ( Imase et al.,
2008; Mallick, 2002; Mohn, 1988 ). Considering this, microalgae bio-
ﬂocculation followed by gravity sedimentation is an easy and low-
cost harvesting technique during wastewater treatment ( Nudogan
and Oswald, 1995; Oh et al., 2001 ). But this approach is not always
efﬁcient, especially in the case of the small size and rapidly growing
unialgal cell ( Munoz, 2005; Munoz and Guieysse, 2006 ). Therefore,
selection of algal–bacterial culture with a natural tendency to settle
down is recommended ( Olguin, 2003; Su et al., 2011 ). Activated
sludge has better gravity settleability compared with microalgae,
and higher organic matter removal capacity than the normal bacte-
ria contained in domestic wastewater ( Gutzeit et al., 2005 ), which

could be used as bacterial inoculum in algal–bacterial culture to en-
hance the biomass settleability and treatment efﬁciency. However,
no report of this approach is available. Furthermore, how different
algae/activated sludge inoculation ratios inﬂuence the biomass sett-
leability and which ratio is better for the settleability are still
unknown.
In this study, for the ﬁrst time, the inﬂuence of initial inoculum
ratios of wastewater-born algae and aerobic activated sludge on
the municipal wastewater treatment and the biomass settleability
were investigated. Besides, the microbial community compositions
in the cultures with different inoculum ratios were investigated.
2. Methods
2.1. Inoculum ratio tests
Wastewater treatment tests were performed in stirred tank pho-
tobioreactors which were made of transparent PVC (40 cm in depth
and 29 cm in diameter) at room temperature (around 23 /C176C). The
total volume of the liquid in the reactor was 14 l (approx. 25 cm
in depth). The algae inoculum was obtained from the second clari-
ﬁer wall of the Suderburg municipal wastewater treatment plant
(County of Uelzen, Lower Saxony, Germany). The collected algae
inoculum (mainly ﬁlamentous blue–green algae observed under a
microscopy) was ﬁrstly settled down for 1 h and then the settled
solids were used as algae inoculum. The aerobic activated sludge
obtained from the same plant (ﬁrst settled down for 1 h and dis-
carded the supernatant) was used as bacteria inoculum. The total
suspended solid (TSS) of initial algae inoculum was 8 g/l. The TSS
of initial activated sludge inoculum was 8 g/l. The six reactors were
ﬁlled with 1200, 1090.9, 1000, 600, 200 and 0 ml algae inoculum
and 0, 109.1, 200, 600, 1000, 1200 ml activated sludge inoculum
to obtain the following algae/sludge ratios of only algae, 10:1, 5:1,
1:1, 1:5 (w/w) and only activated sludge, respectively. The total
inoculum volume was 1.2 l. 12.8 l pretreated wastewater (after pre-
liminary screening, grit removal and primary sedimentation pro-
cess) from the same plant was added into the bioreactors to
investigate the carbon and nutrient removal efﬁciencies. The char-
acterization of the pretreated wastewater was COD: 380.0 ± 15.3
(mg O 2/l), total nitrogen (TN): 50.1 ± 3.0 (mg N/l), NHþ
4-N:
39.4 ± 5.5 (mg/l), PO3/C0
4-P: 8.8 ± 0.9 (mg/l), NO/C0
3-N: 0.02 ± 0.02
(mg/l). NO/C0
2-N: 0 (mg/l). Constant mixing was maintained using a
magnetic stirring bar (100 rpm) to avoid algae sedimentation.
Two compact ﬂuorescent lamps (Sylvania, F20W/860/E27) were
used to irradiate the tank with about 7000 lux (measured at the
top of liquid surface) for a 12 h light–12 h dark cycle (TES-1335 Dig-
ital light Meter). The above batch tests were performed in duplicate.
2.2. Analytical procedures
The dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were measured near the
midway of the reactor using a microprocessor oximeter (Oxi
320/SET, WTW, Germany) coupled with an O 2sensor (CellOx
325, WTW, Germany) and a Crison pH electrode (pH 197-S). Eighty
milliliters of samples for further analysis (see below) were
collected near the midway of the bioreactors with a pipe every
day, 4 h after starting the illumination period. Soluble chemical
oxygen demand (COD), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) and TSS were
analyzed according to DIN 38409-H 41(44), DIN EN 25663-H11
and DIN ISO 11465 ( DEV, 2002 ). NHþ
4, total phosphorus and PO3/C0
4
were determined according to DIN 38406-E5-1 and DIN EN ISO
6878-D11 ( DEV, 2002 ) using an UV/Vis Spectrometer (Perkin
Elmer, Lambda 40, USA). NO/C0
3and NO/C0
2were determined using
an Ion Chromatograph (Dionex DX-100, USA) according to DIN
EN ISO 10304-1 ( DEV, 2002 ). Before analysis of the above parame-ters, the liquid samples were membrane ﬁltered (0.45 lm). To
measure nitrogen or phosphorus in biomass, the samples were ﬁrst
divided into two equal parts. One part was homogenized (IKA T25
digital, ULTRA-TURRAX), while another part was ﬁltered to remove
the solids. Nitrogen or phosphorus in biomass was calculated as
the total nitrogen or phosphorus difference between the homoge-
nized samples and the ﬁltered samples.
2.3. The biomass settleability
At the end of the test, 1 l mixed sample was transfer to 1 l
measurement cylinder to investigate the settleability of the
algal–bacterial biomass with different algae/sludge inoculum
ratios ( Su et al., 2011 ). The TSS samples were taken every 6 min
from 10 cm below the liquid surface of the cylinder with a pipe.
This procedure lasted for 1 h.
2.4. Community analysis
The algal–bacterial culture with different initial algae/bacteria
inoculum ratios were collected at the end of each batch by centri-
fugation at 10,000 rev min/C01for 10 min at 4 /C176C. Each sample was
washed twice with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Genomic DNA was
isolated using the QIAamp™ DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 51504)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) were accomplished as described previously ( Su et al.,
2009; Zhang et al., 2009 ). The similarities between lanes from
DGGE and band intensity were analyzed with Quantity One Soft-
ware (Bio-RadLaboratories) ( Zhang et al., 2011a,b ). Dominant
bands were sequenced (Macrogen, the Netherlands). Sequences
were subjected to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and
Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) analysis ( Zhang et al., 2009 ).
Phylogeny was determined with the RDP classiﬁer and SEQMATCH.
Parsimony phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-
joining method using the MegAlign program (DNASTAR, Madison,
WI, USA) ( Fig. S1, Supplementary data ). The sequences used here
have been deposited in the GenBank under the accession numbers
JN157636–JN157643.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The variation of dissolved oxygen and pH
Change in DO and pH of the reactors inoculated with different
algae/activated sludge ratios are shown in Fig. 1 . At the beginning
of the test, the DO was the same as that of the pretreated wastewa-
ter (around 2 mg/l). After that, it decreased to around 0.1 mg/l in all
the reactors. This means that after consumption of the remaining
O2in the wastewater, the O 2released from the algal photosynthe-
sis was immediately and almost completely consumed by the aer-
obic bacteria. The low DO lasted till the end of the test in the
reactor with only sludge. However, for the reactor with only algae,
the low DO was only observed during the ﬁrst day and increased
gradually to 8.5 mg/l because the main oxygen consumer (aerobic
sludge) was not added. For the other four reactors with both algae
and sludge, the low DO below 0.33 mg/l lasted for different dura-
tions (11 days for algae:activated sludge = 10:1, 7 days for 5:1,
8 days for 1:1 and 12 days for 1:5) and increased gradually to
around 5 mg/l till the end of the test ( Fig. 1 a). The possible reason
for the longer duration time of low DO in the reactor with 10:1
ratio may be due to the aerobic process such as nitriﬁcation. For
the reactor with algae/sludge inoculation ratio of 1:5, the fact that
the O 2generated by the low concentration of algae could not
fulﬁll the respiration demand of the high concentration of bacteria68 Y. Su et al. / Bioresource Technology 105 (2012) 67–73might be responsible for the relatively longer duration of low oxy-
gen concentration.
pH in the reactor with only sludge was stable during the ﬁrst
10 days and dropped softly to around 7 due to the nitriﬁcation.
pH in the reactor with only algae showed different trend compar-
ing with others. It increased to around 9.2 after the ﬁrst 7 days and
became stable till the end of the test. Dissolved CO 2is correlated
with solution pH. The initial increase of pH may due to the inten-
sive CO 2utilization from the medium by algal autotrophic growth.
After that, as there were no enough CO 2supply from bacterial res-
piration, the balance between CO 2capture from air and algal up-
take lead to the pH stability. pH in the other four reactors with
different algae/sludge inoculum ratios showed the similar trend
and level. It increased slightly during the ﬁrst 4 days from 7.5 to
around 8.3 ( Fig. 1 b), which might be caused by CO 2uptake for algal
photosynthesis ( Munoz and Guieysse, 2006 ). After that, pH
dropped back to 7.5 again, which could be due to the nitriﬁcation
process ( Gutzeit et al., 2005 ).
3.2. The inﬂuence of algae/activated sludge inoculum ratios on carbon
source removal
The abilities of the reactors inoculated with different
algae/sludge ratios (10:1, 5:1, 1:1 and 1:5) to mineralize the organic
carbon were investigated. The pattern of COD removal was similar in
these four reactors, indicating that there was no strong relationship
between COD removal and initial algae/activated sludge inoculum
ratios ( Fig. 2 ). A maximal COD removal was attained within 8 days,
during which the COD content decreased from 364.9 ± 5.4,369.7 ± 7.1, 395.8 ± 4.2 and 385.4 ± 5.9 mg O 2/l to 32.2 ± 5.4, 15.4
± 7.1, 14.9 ± 4.2 and 23.1 ± 5.9 mg O 2/l with algae/activated sludge
ratios of 10:1, 5:1, 1:1 and 1:5, respectively. The corresponding
COD removal efﬁciencies were 91.2 ± 1.7%, 95.8 ± 2.0%, 96.2 ± 1.1%
and 94.0 ± 1.6%, respectively. In addition, the COD removal in the
reactors with only algae and only sludge was also investigated. It
was obviously that the COD removal efﬁciencies with only algae
(66.0 ± 6.0%) and only activated sludge (73.6 ± 5.1%) were much
lower than those of the cultures with both of them, indicating the
importance of cooperation between algae and sludge. For the reactor
with only algae culture, the low removal efﬁciency could be due to
the lack of sludge to enhance the organic carbon degradation. For
the reactor with only sludge culture, there was no enough oxygen
supply from algae for their aerobic respiration, and thereby resulting
in low COD removal. Some algae-based bio-systems were used to
treat highly concentrated municipal wastewater and the corre-
sponding COD was removed from initial 2500 mg/l to around
250 mg/l ( Zhou et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011 ). The performance of the
algae–sludge system proposed in this study for high concentration
wastewater treatment could be our further research goal.
3.3. The inﬂuence of algae/activated sludge inoculation ratios on
nitrogen removal
The nitrogen removal was also investigated in the above reac-
tors. The removal of TKN and ammonia were much slower than
that observed for carbon source, which took 2–6 days more. The
reactor with algae/activated sludge ratios of 5:1 exhibited
the highest and fastest TKN removal (95.8% within 10 days). Above
93.7% of TKN was degraded after 14, 12 and 14 days in the reactors
with algae/sludge inoculum ratios of 10:1, 1:1 and 1:5, respec-
tively. The TKN removal efﬁciency in the reactor with only algae
was also reached to 89% after 14 days. While, for the reactor with
only sludge, the TKN removal efﬁciency was only 31.4 ± 3.0% due
to the long duration of low DO concentration which could not sup-
port the oxygen demand of the nitriﬁcation ( Fig. 3 a). These results
matched with the NHþ
4-N removal efﬁciency shown in Fig. 3 b. The
better performance of the reactor with algae/sludge ratio of 5:1
was probably due to its proper inoculation ratio which promoted
the cooperation between the algae and sludge.
On the other hand, NO/C0
3-N was always detected in the efﬂuent of
all the reactors, up to 7.0 ± 0.2, 5.2 ± 0.3, 2.3 ± 0.3, 1.9 ± 0.3, 1.6 ± 0.2
and 6.6 ± 0.3 mg/l for the reactors with only algae, 10:1, 5:1, 1:1, 1:5
(algae/sludge) and only sludge, respectively ( Fig. 3 c). NO/C0
2was never
detected in the reactors with algae/sludge ratio of 5:1 and only
sludge. 17.0 ± 0.4, 14.3 ± 0.2, 1.8 ± 0.3 and 20.6 ± 0.3 mg/l of NO/C0

inoculation ratios.Y. Su et al. / Bioresource Technology 105 (2012) 67–73 69were detected in the ﬁnal efﬂuent of the other four reactors (only
algae, 10:1, 1:1 and 1:5, respectively) ( Fig. 3 d).
In order to investigate the nitrogen removal mechanism with
different algae/activated sludge ratios, the mass balance of nitro-
gen were calculated ( Table 1 ). The total nitrogen removal efﬁciency
was 41.7 ± 6.4%, 58.6 ± 5.8%, 91.0 ± 7.0%, 86.0 ± 8.5%, 50.2 ± 7.0%
and 18.6 ± 6.0% for only algae, 10:1, 5:1, 1:1, 1:5 (algae/activated
sludge) and only sludge cultures. With algae/sludge inoculum ra-
tios of 5:1 and 1:1, assimilation into algal–bacterial biomass repre-
sented the main nitrogen removal mechanism, accounting for
60.0 ± 0.3% and 41.6 ± 0.5% of the total inlet nitrogen, while
nitriﬁcation only represented 4.6 ± 0.7% and 7.8 ± 1.3% in the
above-referred system, respectively. In contrast, in the other sys-
tems with only algae, 10:1, 1:5, (algae/sludge) and only sludge,
about 47.4 ± 2.2%, 36.4 ± 1.6%, 44.6 ± 2.1% and 12.9 ± 2.9% of inlet
nitrogen were oxidized into NO/C0
3and NO/C0
2by nitriﬁcation and
not further removed. Accumulation of nitrogen into algal–bacterial
biomass only accounted for 20.0 ± 0.4%, 24.9 ± 0.7%, 14.9 ± 0.9%
and 11.7 ± 0.3% of the inlet nitrogen in these four reactors, respec-
tively. The above results indicated that different algae and bacteria
compositions lead to different algal and bacterial activity which
resulted in different nutrient removal mechanism.
3.4. The inﬂuence of algae/activated sludge inoculation ratios on
phosphorus removal
The PO3/C0
4-P removal in these reactors was also investigated. As
shown in Fig. 3 e, the fastest and highest phosphorus removal was
found in the reactor inoculated with algae/activated sludge ratio of
5:1 (93.5 ± 2.5% reduction within 10 days), followed by the reactor
with algae/activated sludge ratio of 1:1 (82.9 ± 2.0% in 12 days).
While, only 72.7 ± 1.8% and 64.0 ± 2.0% PO3/C0
4was removed within
14 days in the reactors inoculated with algae/activated sludge ratio
of 1:5 and 10:1, respectively ( Fig. 3 e). In the control test with only
algae, the P removal efﬁciency was 54.4 ± 2.0% within 14 days.
There were two possible reasons for this low P removal efﬁciency.
Firstly, light inhibition among algae cells led to low algae auto-trophic growth. Secondly, without the main CO 2supply partner
(sludge), the photosynthesis of algae was limited as the only CO 2
source was from the air. Similarly, only 10.6 ± 1.8% phosphate re-
moval was observed in the reactor with sole activated sludge,
which may be due to the lack of algal involvement and poor phos-
phorus removal capability of activated sludge.
The mass balance of phosphorus indicated that accumulation
into the biomass was the main removal mechanism of phosphorus,
which accounted for 50.5 ± 2.3%, 60.8 ± 1.2%, 91.4 ± 2.4%, 80.9 ±
1.0%, 71.8 ± 1.4% and 5.2 ± 1.2% of the total inlet phosphorus for
the only algae, 10:1, 5:1, 1:1, 1:5 (algae/sludge) and only sludge cul-
tures ( Table 1 ). It has been reported that both biomass uptake and
phosphate precipitation can account for the decrease in phosphate
levels ( Godos et al., 2009 ). The abiotic P removal process (normally
occurred at pH 9–11) could have a minor inﬂuence in this study
due to the relative low pH ( Nudogan and Oswald, 1995 ).
The above results indicated that different inoculation ratios
have great inﬂuences on nitrogen and phosphorus removal. It is
obvious that the inoculation ratio of 5:1 (algae/activated sludge)
gave the best results concerning nutrient removal efﬁciency and
retention time. Either too high or too low algae/sludge ratio in
the inoculum was not good for nutrients removal.
The algae concentration determines light utilization efﬁciency
and also controls the oxygenation supply and removal efﬁciencies
achieved in the algal–bacterial system ( Janssen et al., 2003; Munoz
and Guieysse, 2006; Munoz et al., 2004 ). However, it is not as ex-
pected that the higher the algae concentration in the symbiotic
system, the higher nutrient removal efﬁciency. There were several
explanations for this behavior. The nutrient removal was always
limited by the O 2generation rate in the initial phase of the exper-
iments, which was initially proportional to the algal density within
certain range, but rapidly became limited by the availability of
light once the algae concentration reached a certain value
(Guieysse et al., 2002 ). After the algae concentration reached a cer-
tain level, it had no effect on the nutrient uptake rate, since about
the same numbers of algae were actually working in this system
(Burrell et al., 1985 ). In addition, it should be noticed that the high0510152025303540455055

crease of O 2consumption due to the algal dark respiration
(Guieysse et al., 2002; Lau et al., 1995 ).
3.5. The inﬂuence of initial algae/activated sludge inoculation ratios on
the biomass settleability
At the end of the test, the settleability of the algal–bacterial bio-
mass with different initial algae/activated sludge inoculum ratios
was investigated. Obviously, the culture with only activated sludge
showed the best settleability (from 1.60 ± 0.02 to 0.05 ± 0.02 g/l
within only 24 min) ( Fig. 4 ). The biomass from the reactor with
inoculum ratio of 1:5 (algae:sludge) also showed a good settleabil-
ity, which could settle down from 1.64 ± 0.02 to 0.05 ± 0.02 g/l
(TSS) within 30 min, followed by 1:1, 5:1 and 10:1 (algae/sludge)
cultures (from 1.85 ± 0.02 g/l to 0.05 ± 0.02 g/l within 36 min, from
1.91 ± 0.03 g/l to 0.06 ± 0.03 g/l within 42 min and from
1.72 ± 0.02 g/l to 0.21 ± 0.02 g/l within 60 min, respectively). The
culture with only algae showed the lowest settleability (from ini-
tial 1.68 ± 0.03 to 0.41 ± 0.03 g/l).
The above results proved the hypothesis that activated sludge
could enhance the settleability of algae biomass. Besides, the bind-
ing mechanisms inﬂuenced by algae cell surface properties, extra-
cellular polymeric substances and the cations amount supported
the bio-ﬂocculation process leading to the formation of settleable
biomass ( Gutzeit et al., 2005 ) and the high pH could decrease the
biomass settleability and lead to reactor washout ( Hende et al.,
2010 ).
3.6. The microbial community
The DGGE proﬁles of bacteria community sampled from the
four reactors at the end of the test are summarized in Fig. 5 . Thesimilarities between lane A (algae/sludge ratio of 1:1) and lane B
(5:1) were more than 80%, indicating these two reactors had sim-
ilar dominant bacterial community. While, the similarities be-
tween lane A (B), lane C (1:5) and lane D (10:1) were lower than
30%, only band 1, 2 and 10 universally occurred in lane A, B and
C. The intensities of band 8 and 9 in lane A and lane B were strong,
while the intensities of band 4 and 5 were strong in lane C. Bacteria
represented by these bands might take part in wastewater treat-
ment. The above results indicate that initial algae/sludge inocula-
tion ratios can affect the bacterial community compositions of
the algal–bacterial culture, which might contribute to the different
removal efﬁciencies as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . In addition, some of
the bacteria in the cultivated cultures were not the dominant spe-
cies or undetected in the original inoculum, which indicated that
speciﬁc bacteria were enrich during operation.
In order to provide more insight into microbial consortium, eight
predominant species extracted from DGGE bands were sequenced
and matched based on the 16S rDNA gen library results ( Table 2 ).
Band 1 and 10 are classiﬁed as Alphaproteobacteria . The gene se-
quence from band 1 showed 97% similarity to uncultured bacteriumTable 1

from a submerged membrane bioreactor treating synthetic inor-
ganic wastewater. The gene sequence from band 10 showed 95%
similarity to uncultured bacterium THPA.0912.142, which was a
particle-attached bacterial sample from lake. Band 5 and 8 are clas-
siﬁed as Flavobacteria . The gene sequence from band 5 showed 96%
similarity to uncultured bacterium F1Q32TO05FZEFF, which was
isolated from suspended biomass for Guri wastewater treatment
(Soondong et al., 2010 ). The gene sequence from band 8 showed
98% similarity to Kaistella koreensis Chj707, which was isolated from
industrial wastewater as phenolic compounds degrading bacteria.
Band 2 is classiﬁed as Gammaproteobacteria isolated from an aerobic
activated sludge system. Band 4 is classiﬁed as Betaproteobacteria
isolated from biomass of Guri wastewater treatment plant
(Soondong et al., 2010 ). Band 9 is classiﬁed as Sphingobacteria iso-
lated from Kobresia Meadow soil as ammonia degrading bacteria.
The above results further indicated that the bacterial communities
were diverse in reactors inoculated with different algae/sludge
ratios, which could be an explanation of different treatment perfor-
mance in these reactors. Further identiﬁcation of the cultivated algal
species and study the efﬁciency of each identiﬁed dominant micro-
organism may be helpful for active species selection and better
understanding and optimization of the treatment system.
4. Conclusion
The wastewater treatment and biomass settleability were en-
hanced through the synergistic cooperation between wastewater-
born algae and activated sludge. More than 91.2% of COD was re-
moved regardless of algae and sludge inoculation ratios. The reac-
tor with 5:1 (algae/sludge) culture reached the highest total
nitrogen and phosphorus removal efﬁciency (91.0 ± 7.0% and
93.5 ± 2.5%, respectively) within the shortest time (10 days). Bio-
mass uptake was identiﬁed as the main nitrogen and phosphorus
removal mechanism. Besides, the biomass settleability was im-
proved with proper inoculation ratio. Furthermore, different al-
gae/bacteria inoculation ratios lead to different bacterial
community compositions, which might contribute to the different
treatment performance.

Four common used microalgae species were compared in terms of settleability, nutrient removal capacity
and biomass productivity. After 1 month training, except cyanobacteria Phormidium sp., three green mic-
roalgae species, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ,Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus rubescens , showed good
settleability. The N and P removal efﬁciency was all above 99% within 7, 4, 6 and 6 days for N and 4, 2,
3 and 4 days for P, resulting in the N removal rates of 3.66 ± 0.17, 6.39 ± 0.20, 4.39 ± 0.06 and
4.31 ± 0.18 mg N/l/d and P removal rates of 0.56 ± 0.07, 0.89 ± 0.05, 0.76 ± 0.09 and 0.60 ± 0.05 mg P/l/d
forPhormidium sp.,C. reinhardtii ,C. vulgaris and S. rubescens , respectively. Phormidium sp. had the lowest
algal biomass productivity (2.71 ± 0.7 g/m2/d) and the other three green microalgae showed higher algal
biomass productivity (around 6 g/m2/d). Assimilation into biomass was the main removal mechanism for
N and P.

1. Introduction
Algal-based biotechnology has been investigated for municipal
wastewater treatment over the past few years ( Oswald, 1988; Su
et al., 2011b; Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995 ). Some researchers also
tested the feasibility of algal–bacterial symbiotic system for the
agricultural and industrial wastewater treatment ( Munoz, 2005;
Munoz and Guieysse, 2006 ). As algae could increase the dissolved
oxygen concentration in the culture, assimilate nutrient and CO 2
through photosynthetic metabolism thus integration reducing en-
ergy requirement for mechanical aeration, wastewater puriﬁcation
and green gas mitigation. The by-product of this treatment process
is a high yield of protein-rich algal biomass which could be further
used for agricultural fertilizer, biofuels and biogass production(Logan and Ronald, 2011; Rawat et al., 2011 ). All of these make al-
gal-based biotechnology attractive compared with the conven-
tional treatment technologies.
However, two bottlenecks are still the major limitations of the
exploitation of this technology. The ﬁrst one is the selection of
highly-effective microalgae species. Some algae species are care-
fully chosen in terms of nutrient removal rate and biofuel genera-
tion potential. Among them, cyanobacteria Phormidium sp. with a
high tolerance to extreme temperatures was an efﬁcient strain
for tertiary wastewater treatment ( Olguin, 2003 ). The previous
study also showed that Chlamydomonas and Chlorella were two
dominant algae strains and played important roles during long-
term piggery wastewater treatment ( de Godos et al., 2009; Kong
et al., 2010 ). And Scenedesmus was a high-potential algae species
for industrial wastewater treatment and high in lipid concentra-
tion which could be further used for biodiesel production ( Termini
et al., 2011; Martinez et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2008 ). But most of
these algae were tested separately with different bioreactor conﬁg-
urations and environmental conditions, and few reports focused on

the comparison of the nutrient removal capability and biomass
generation rate of these high-potential microalgae species.
The second challenge is how to harvest the algal biomass in a
low-cost way ( Mohn, 1988; Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995 ). A phys-
ical separation unit consisting of ﬁltration or centrifugation has
been applied ( Mohn, 1988 ), but they are not economical and
unsuitable for large-scale microalgae collection. The chemical ﬂoc-
culation followed by either sedimentation or ﬂotation by addition
chemicals such as alum, lime or calcium chloride would lead to the
increase of efﬂuent salinity and causes the secondary pollutants
(Oh et al., 2001; Imase et al., 2008; Lee et al., 1998 ). Using immo-
bilization system by alginate, carrageenan or chitosan could solve
the biomass harvest problem ( Gonzalez and Bashan, 2000; Cheva-
lier and de la Noue, 1985 ), but these matrices are costly and inef-
ﬁcient during long-term operation ( Su et al., 2009 ). Therefore,
naturally fast settleable algae species are required. At present,
the common standard for selection of algae species candidates
for wastewater treatment generally focuses on the nutrient re-
moval capacity, growth rate and lipid content in cells ( de Godos
et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011 ). However, good algal biomass sett-
leability is also a crucial factor associated with the success of al-
gal-based system for both wastewater treatment and further
utilization, which need to be investigated in detailed. So far, the
information about the settling capacity of these high-potential
microalgae is still missing.
In this study, for the ﬁrst time, four common used and high-po-
tential microalgae species were compared in terms of settling
capacity, biomass productivity and nutrient removal. This study
is helpful for better understanding and controlling the wastewater
treatment and value-added biomass accumulation with algal-
based technology, thus resulting in overall optimization.
2. Methods
2.1. Settleable microalgae strains cultivation
One cyanobacteria strain ( Phormidium sp.), two green microal-
gae strains ( Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Scenedesmus rubescens )
were obtained from the Institute for Cereal Processing Ltd. (IGV,
Germany) and grown on BG11, TAP and 1/2 Tamiya media respec-
tively at room temperature. Another green microalga ( Chlorella vul-
garis ) was obtained from Scandinavian Culture Collection of Algae
& Protozoa (Denmark) and grown on a modiﬁed MWC media at
room temperature ( Zhang et al., 2011 ). The initial volatile sus-
pended solids (VSS) of the four microalgae cultures were around
0.8 g/l, respectively. Five litres glass beakers were used as photo-
bioreactor with a consistent mixing (300 rpm, VWR
984VW0CSTEUS, USA). A ﬂuorescent lamp (Philips TL-D36w/840,
Poland) was used to irradiate from the side of the reactors in a
light:dark cycle of 12:12 h, to mimic natural solar day–night cycle,
with 7000 lux (measured at the side of bioreactor with TES-1335
Digital light meter). In order to cultivate the settleable algal cul-
ture, the mixing procedure was stopped every 23 h for 1 h and
the ﬂoating algae biomass was discarded with a screen (0.5 mm).
Two litres wastewater, collected from the efﬂuent of the second
clariﬁer in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Holthusen
(Germany), was exchanged after sedimentation every 3 days to
maintain a nutrient supply. The characterization of the wastewater
used here was COD: 30.2 ± 2.5 (mg O 2/l), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen
(TKN): 26.4 ± 0.7 (mg N/l), NHþ

3—N:0:75/C60:06ðmg =lÞand NO/C0
2—N:
0:10/C60:06ðmg =lÞ. After 1 month of cultivation, the turbidity of
the culture during 1 h sedimentation was measured (Turbidity
photometer, Dr. Lange, Type-Nr. LPG239, Germany) according to
DIN EN27027 ( DEV, 2002 ).2.2. Experimental operation
After 1 month cultivation, four microalgae suspension were
centrifuged (10,000 /C2g), washed three times with deionized water
to remove the residual nutrient. The initial algae concentration of
the four microalgae was 0.4 g/l (VSS). The same laboratory-scale
reactor system as the cultivation process was used, and all the fol-
lowing tests were carried out in batch mode. Another reactor ﬁlled
with 5 L wastewater without algae addition was set up for control
experiments. All the experiments were carried out in duplicate.
2.3. Analytical methods
The temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were measured
near the midway of the reactor by using a digital multi parameter
meter (Multi 3430 WTW, Germany) coupled with an O 2sensor
(CellOx 325, WTW, Germany) and a pH electrode (pH SenTix 940,
Germany). Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) and VSS were analyzed
according to DIN EN 25663-H11 and DIN ISO 11465 ( DEV, 2002 ).
NHþ
4, total phosphorus and dissolved phosphorus (PO3/C0
4) were
determined according to DIN 38406-E5-1 and DIN EN ISO 6878-
D11 ( DEV, 2002 ) using an UV/Vis Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer,
Lambda 40, USA). NO/C0
3and NO/C0
2were determined using an Ion
Chromatograph (Dionex DX-100, USA) according to DIN EN ISO
10304-1 ( DEV, 2002 ). Before analysis of the above parameters in li-
quid, the samples were membrane ﬁltered (0.45 lm). To measure
nitrogen or phosphorus in biomass, the samples were ﬁrst divided
into two identical parts. One part was homogenized, while another
part was ﬁltered to remove the solids. Nitrogen or phosphorus in
biomass was calculated as the total nitrogen or phosphorus differ-
ence between the homogenized samples and the ﬁltered samples.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The settleability of the four microalgae strains
After 1 month cultivation and training, the microalgal biomass
settleability within 1 h was investigated. As shown in Fig. 1 , three
green microalgae species C. vulgaris ,C. reinhardtii and S. rubescens
showed good settleability, as most of the algal biomass could settle
to the bottom of the bioreactor in the ﬁrst 15 min. The correspond-
ing turbidity decreased from initial 510.8 ± 1.5, 508.3 ± 2.5 and
522.4 ± 2.5 FTU to 6.22 ± 1.5, 8.27 ± 2.5 and 6.34 ± 2.5 FTU during
the ﬁrst 15 min and then decreased slightly to 1.84 ± 1.5,
2.76 ± 2.5 and 4.79 ± 2.5 FTU after 1 h sedimentation for C. vulgaris ,

(Phormidium sp.) showed a poor settleability which dropped from
initial 453.8 ± 5.0 FTU to around 31.9 ± 5.0 FTU after ﬁrst 15 min
sedimentation and no further reduction. This result was consistent
with the previous study which reported that the settleability of the
algal-based system became poor with the growth of ﬁlamentous
cyanobacteria. The other three green unicellular microalgae
showed good settleabilities which had good prospects for the
utilization.
Only around 5% of reduction in FTU was observed before culti-
vation and training (data not shown). Comparatively, the settlea-
bilities of the four algal species were greatly improved after the
cultivation and training, which indicated that the special cultiva-
tion strategy (alternate mixing and non-mixing operation) used
contributes to the improvement of the settleability of the four algal
species. Besides, the different cell surface properties and extracel-
lular polymeric substances (EPS) of C. vulgaris ,C. reinhardtii and S.
rubescens might contribute to the better settleability than that of
Phormidium sp. It has been reported that the change of cell surface
properties and the quantity of EPS are related with the algal sett-
leability capacity ( Lavoie and de la Noue, 1987; Gutzeit et al.,
2005 ).
3.2. The variation of dissolved oxygen and pH
Changes in DO and pH of the reactors inoculated with four dif-
ferent unicellular microalgae are recorded in Fig. 2 . The DO for the
reactors inoculated with C. vulgaris ,C. reinhardtii and S. rubescens
increased to the peak value (around 16 mg/l) as soon as starting
the batch test. Comparing with the above green algae species,
the DO value for Phormidium sp. increased slower to the peak va-
lue. The possible reasons for this phenomenon may be the oxygen
consumption by intensive nitriﬁcation process of the reactor inoc-ulated with Phormidium sp. (Fig. 3 C and D) and the relatively low
oxygen production capacity of Phormidium sp. The DO level was
an indication of algal photosynthesis activity but excessive DO con-
centration (>35 mg/l) could severely inhibit microalgal growth
(Kumar et al., 2010 ). For the control test, the DO decreased from
the initial 6 mg/l to around 1.5 mg/l within the ﬁrst 3 days due to
nitriﬁcation and then recovered to 8 mg/l which are close to the
saturation. The constant mixing and possible growth of photo-
trophic bacteria might contribute to the recovery of DO after Day 4.
The pH trend of the four unicellular microalgae was quite sim-
ilar, which jumped to around 9 during the ﬁrst 2 days and in-
creased gradually till 10 at the end of the test ( Fig. 2 B). The
increase in pH may be due to the algal photosynthesis activity
(Oswald, 1988 ). While, it is worth noting that the increase of pH
for the cyanobacteria Phormidium sp. in the ﬁrst 5 days was lower
than that of the other three green algae, the intensive nitriﬁcation
in the reactor with Phormidium sp. was the possible reason for this
phenomenon ( Fig. 3 C and D). The culture pH was much lower and
stable (below 9) when treating pretreated municipal wastewater
(Su et al., 2011a ) as there were more organic carbon in the pre-
treated municipal wastewater ( Hende et al., 2011 ). Comparing
with reactors with algae, a rather low pH level was recorded in
the control test due to the intensive nitriﬁcation process (as shown
inFig. 3 ). The possible growth of phototrophic bacteria which led
to the CO 2consumption might be the possible reason for the slight
raise of pH after Day 4.
Many unicellular freshwater microalgae are capable of growing
at both acidic and alkaline as an adaptative response to widely
ﬂuctuating environments conditions, even though their pH optima
are closer to 8 ( Goldman et al., 1982 ). It was reported that certain
algae species such as C. vulgaris were extremely sensitive to alka-
line pH so that the biomass levels at the upper pH were lower than
attained at lower pH. But Scenedesmus obliquus was relatively unaf-
fected by a varying pH. While, acidic condition (<6) would have an
inhibitory effect on the growth of Scenedesmus sp. LX1 ( Li et al.,
2010 ). The detail information on the effects of pH on the growth
and nutrient removal rate of different algae species should be fur-
ther investigated as it is relatively easy to control the pH in biolog-
ical system.
3.3. The nutrient removal and biomass productivity
The nutrient removal processes of four unicellular microalgae
are shown in Fig. 3 . Nearly all of the NHþ
4—N was removed within
4, 4, 6 and 6 days and the PO3/C0
4—P removal efﬁciency was above
98% within 4, 2, 3 and 4 days for Phormidium sp.,C. reinhardtii ,C.
vulgaris and S. rubescens , respectively. The NO/C0
3—N for the three
green microalgae showed the similar trend which kept the initial
value (around 0.8 mg/l) during the ﬁrst 3, 5 and 5 days for C. rein-
hardtii ,C. vulgaris and S. rubescens , respectively, but decreased
immediately to below 0.05 mg/l as soon as the deletion of ammo-
nium. For C. reinhardtii , the NO/C0
2—N concentration was always be-
low 0.25 mg/l during the ﬁrst 3 days and decreased to 0.07 mg/l at
the end of the batch (4 days). For the other two green microalgae,
the NO/C0
2—N increased from initial 0.06 mg/l to a peak value of
around 0.61 and 1.42 mg/l within 5 days and decreased to below
0.1 mg/l at the end of the test (6 days) for C. vulgaris and S. rubes-
cens, respectively. This phenomenon showed that microalgae pre-
fer to utilize ammonium ﬁrst when ammonium, nitrate and
nitrite were all available, which was in accordance with the previ-
ous studies ( Li et al., 2010; Perez-Garcia et al., 2011 ). However, Li
et al. (2010) reported that the algal biomass concentration was sig-
niﬁcantly lower when feeding with ammonium than that with ni-
trate. The cyanobacteria Phormidium sp. showed different trend for
the removal of NO/C0
3—N and NO/C0
2—N compared with those of the
three green microalgae species ( Fig. 3 C and D), as nitriﬁcation pro-02468101214161820

3—N
(1.21 mg/l) and NO/C0
2—N (4.72 mg/l) was appeared at the fourth
day. But both of them were assimilated by Phormidium sp. within
the following 3 days.
Much lower phosphorus removal (7.44%) was observed in the
control reactor without microalgae addition within 7 days, which
indicated the high phosphorus removal potential of the four se-
lected microalgae species. Comparing with the phosphate, ammo-
nium was much easier to remove in the control reactor, as 85.7% of
NHþ
4—N was removed but most of the removed NHþ
4—N (around
93.7%) was transferred into NO/C0
3—N through nitriﬁcation process.
Only 6.3% of the lost nitrogen in the control test might be removed
through denitriﬁcation process rather than ammonia volatilization
as the rather low pH value (<8) was recorded in the control test.
There are two possible reasons for the weak denitriﬁcation in the
control test. The low organic carbon source and the relatively high
DO level for denitriﬁcation could not support intensive denitriﬁca-
tion process. The nitriﬁcation process through nitriﬁers always
competed with the ammonium uptake by microalgae as NO/C0
3—N
and NO/C0
2—N were two important byproducts during wastewater
treatment by algal-based technology ( de Godos et al., 2009; Su
et al., 2011b; Zhang et al., 2011 ). From the above results, the cya-
nobacteria showed relatively lower capability compared with the
other three green microalgae species in competition with nitriﬁer
for ammonium utilization, as the high NO/C0
3—N and NO/C0
2—N con-
centrations were recorded during the operation in the reactor inoc-
ulated with cyanobacteria.
The algal biomass productivity, N and P removal rates of the
four different unicellular microalgae species were investigated
(Table 1 ).S. rubescens had the highest biomass productivity
(6.56 ± 0.8 g/m2/d), followed by C. vulgaris (6.28 ± 0.8 g/m2/d) andC. reinhardtii (6.06 ± 1.2 g/m2/d). The cyanobacteria Phormidium
sp. had the lowest biomass productivity capacity which was only
2.71 ± 0.7 g/m2/d.C. reinhardtii showed the best N and P removal
capacity which were 6.39 ± 0.20 mg N/l/d and 0.89 ± 0.05 mg P/l/
d. The N and P removal rates for C. vulgaris were 4.39 ± 0.06 mg
N/l/d and 0.76 ± 0.09 mg P/l/d, followed by 4.31 ± 0.18 mg N/l/d
and 0.60 ± 0.05 mg P/l/d for S. rubescens . The cyanobacteria Phormi-
dium sp. still showed the lowest N and P removal rate which was
only 3.66 ± 0.17 mg N/l/d and 0.56 ± 0.07 mg P/l/d.
From the above results, it was clear that the three green micro-
algae C. reinhardtii ,C. vulgaris and S. rubescens were suitable for
integration of wastewater treatment and algae cultivation in terms
of biomass settleability, nutrient removal rate and biomass pro-
ductivity. The N and P removal rates of all the four unicellular mic-
roalgae species were much higher than those of previously
reported wastewater-born algae obtained from the wall of the
secondary clariﬁer of the wastewater treatment plant (around
3.7 mg N/l/d and 0.4 mg P/l/d), but the latter had a higher algal
biomass generation rates (10.9 ± 1.1 g/m2/d) (Su et al., 2011a ).
3.4. Nitrogen and phosphorus balance
Both nitrogen and phosphorus balance were investigated
(Table 2 ). Based on the nitrogen balance, more than 92.9%, 89.4%,
90.1% and 88.8% of the removed nitrogen (25.0 ± 0.1, 24.3 ± 0.2,
24.8 ± 0.1 and 24.2 ± 0.1 mg N/l) was assimilated into algae bio-
mass for Phormidium sp.,C. reinhardtii ,C. vulgaris and S. rubescens ,
respectively. And 6.8%, 10.2%, 10.0% and 10.5% of removed nitrogen
(1.82 ± 0.87, 2.76 ± 1.0, 2.74 ± 0.47 and 2.85 ± 0.78 mg N/l) was in
the form of N 2or N 2O through nitriﬁcation–denitriﬁcation process
or lost through ammonia volatilization for above four algae species,051015202530

NO/C0
3—N and NO/C0
2—N at the end of test in the above four reactors.
As shown in Fig. 3 ,N O/C0
3—N and NO/C0
2—N were the byproducts dur-
ing the wastewater treatment through nitriﬁers but removed after-
ward through algal uptake and denitriﬁcation. The gas of N 2or N 2O
was not measured in this open system, but based on the nitrogen
balance, around 10% of the inlet nitrogen was lost through ammo-
nia volatilization and transfer into N 2or N 2O through denitriﬁca-
tion ( Liao et al., 1995; Clauwaert et al., 2007 ). But the low
organic carbon and rather high DO concentration could not support
the denitriﬁcation process in this system. Besides, the high pH va-
lue after the ﬁrst 2 days ( Fig. 2 ) was also the evidence which indi-
cated that the left removed nitrogen was more likely lost through
ammonia volatilization ( Liao et al., 1995 ). N 2O and N 2are common
products in denitriﬁcation process. N 2O is a strong greenhouse gas
and even has been observed as main product over N 2in conven-
tional denitriﬁcation process ( Zeng et al., 2003 ). The direct uptake
of most of the nitrogen in the culture by microalgae resulted in the
reduction of N 2O emission in this study, thereby the conventional
nitrogen reduction process (NO 3-?NO2-?N2O?N2) becoming less
dominant. The above results indicated that algal biomass uptake
was the main nitrogen removal mechanism in these systems. This
result is consistent with the previous studies in which algal uptake
was the main N removal mechanism for municipal or artiﬁcial
wastewater treatment ( Su et al., 2011a; Zhang et al., 2011 ). While,
for piggery wastewater treatment, nitriﬁcation-denitriﬁcation was
identiﬁed as the main N removal mechanism as more inlet nitro-
gen was transfer into NO/C0
3or released into atmosphere ( de Godos
et al., 2009 ). The different nutrient composition of wastewater
and different algal culture composition may be the possible rea-
sons for the different N removal mechanisms within the systems.
The mechanism of phosphorus removal has signiﬁcant relation-
ship with the culture pH change as abiotic phosphorus precipitation
would take place when pH is above 9 ( Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995 ).
From Fig. 2 B, the culture pH was all below 9 in the ﬁrst day for all
the four algal species and this low pH trend (below 9) even lasted
till the second day for S. rubescens . After that, culture pH of 9.05,9.52, 9.24 were observed in the second day for Phormidium sp.,C.
reinhardtii and C. vulgaris , and 9.52 were recorded on the third
day for S. rubescens , which could promote the abiotic phosphorus
precipitation. However, it is worth mentioning that nearly 93%,
65.5%, 85.2% and 69.5% of the inlet phosphorus was already re-
moved through algal uptake before the pH increased to 9 for Pho-
rmidium sp.,C. reinhardtii ,C. vulgaris and S. rubescens , respectively.
At the end of the test, more than 96.7%, 96.1%, 96.9% and 97.9% of
the removed PO3/C0
4—P (1.74 ± 0.03, 1.72 ± 0.05, 1.56 ± 0.04 and
1.82 ± 0.03 mg P/l) were tested in the biomass and sediment which
showed that they were removed through algal biomass assimilation
and precipitation ( Table 2 ) for Phormidium sp., C. reinhardtii ,C.
vulgaris and S. rubescens , respectively. Although it is difﬁcult to
quantify the proportion of the abiotic precipitation as the sediment
is mixed with the algal biomass, the above results already indicated
that the algal uptake is still the main mechanism of phosphorus
removal in this study. Similar results were found in the previous
studies that assimilation was the main P removal mechanism for
algal–bacterial culture ( Su et al., 2011a; Zhang et al., 2011 ).
4. Conclusion
Three unicellular green microalgal species, C. reinhardtii ,C.
vulgaris and S. rubescens were, one cyanobacteria, Phormidium sp.,
were trained for tertiary wastewater treatment and compared in
terms of settleability capacity, nutrient removal capacity and bio-
mass productivity. Compared with the cyanobacteria, the three
green microalgae showed the better settleability, nutrient removal
rate and biomass productivity. Based on the N and P balance,
assimilation into algal biomass was the main removal mechanism
for both N and P.

The inﬂuence of biotic (algal inoculum concentration) and abiotic factors (illumination cycle, mixing
velocity and nutrient strength) on the treatment efﬁciency, biomass generation and settleability were
investigated with selected mixed algal culture. Dark condition led to poor nutrient removal efﬁciency.
No signiﬁcant difference in the N, P removal and biomass settleability between continuous and alternat-
ing illumination was observed, but a higher biomass generation capability for the continuous illumina-
tion was obtained. Different mixing velocity led to similar phosphorus removal efﬁciencies (above
98%) with different retention times. The reactor with 300 rpm mixing velocity had the best N removal
capability. For the low strength wastewater, the N rates were 5.4 ± 0.2, 9.1 ± 0.3 and 10.8 ± 0.3 mg/l/d
and P removal rates were 0.57 ± 0.03, 0.56 ± 0.03 and 0.72 ± 0.05 mg/l/d for reactors with the algal inoc-
ulum concentration of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/l, respectively. Low nutrient removal efﬁciency and poor biomass
settleability were obtained for high strength wastewater.

1. Introduction
Municipal wastewater containing both organic carbon and
nutrient could cause eutrophication and deterioration of aquatic
ecosystems. These substances need to be removed or captured
from wastewater before reuse or return to the environment. A sta-
ble and high carbon removal could be easily achieved with many
conventional biotechnologies, while nutrient removal is a complex
and costly process which involves several steps and technologies
(Ahn, 2006; Oehmen et al., 2007; Yeoman et al., 1988 ). Therefore,
optimizing cost effective and efﬁcient technologies for one-step
tertiary treatment of wastewater is now given high priority.
Microalgae are an important bioresource that could be further
used for biofuels production ( Rawat et al., 2011 ). They are regardedas a potential bioenergy source to face the global threats of fuel
shortage. However, cost-effective algae cultivation and harvesting
are two obstacles to the exploitation of this technology ( Mohn,
1988; Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995 ). Municipal wastewater is rich
in nitrogen, phosphorus and trace metal elements and thus could
offer a readily available and cost-effective growth medium for
microalgae. The microalgae could assimilate nutrient ðNHþ

puriﬁcation and algal biomass production ( Su et al., 2011 ).
Certain unicellular microalgae such as Chlorella ,Scenedesmus ,
Phormidium and Chlamydomonas have been reported as high-po-
tential candidates for domestic wastewater treatment and biofuel
production ( Gutzeit et al., 2005; Lin and Lin, 2011; Olguin, 2003;
Rawat et al., 2010 ). However, it is difﬁcult to maintain pure culture
during the operation because of constant airborne contamination
in the open system and impacts from the wastewater ( Perez-Garcia
et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there are
few studies on the mixture of unicellular microalgae for municipal
wastewater treatment and whether mixed algal culture could

enhance the treatment performance over an algal monoculture is
uncertain. Besides algae species, algal inoculum concentration is
another important biotic factor resulting in different nutrient re-
moval rates, biomass growth rate and settleability ( Guieysse
et al., 2002 ), which should be investigated in detail for the mixed
culture.
On the other hand, certain abiotic factors such as the light-dark
cycle, mixing velocity and initial nutrient concentration have been
described as the main physical parameters affecting algal activity
that could result in differences in wastewater treatment efﬁciency
(Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 2011 ). Although some researchers have
explored the effect of light intensity ( Cheirsilp and Torpee, 2012 ),
few studies focus on the illumination cycle. As sunlight in the nat-
ural environment is periodically absent, an additional artiﬁcial
light might be supplied during darkness in order to get better
nutrient removal efﬁciency within shorter retention time if the
whole-day illumination is favorable for nutrient removal and algal
growth. Moreover, mixing to keep the algae suspended and period-
ically illuminated is indispensable for both algae cultivation and
wastewater treatment in algae-based systems ( Azad and Borchard,
1970; Olguin, 2003 ). However, which mixing velocity could
optimize both energy conservation and high nutrient removal
efﬁciencies is still largely unknown. In addition, the nutrient
concentration of wastewater after the secondary treatment is
always below the range of medial strength domestic wastewater
(Christenson and Sims, 2011 ). Whether this nutrient concentra-
tion is sufﬁcient and suitable for algal growth and whether the dif-
ferent nutrient concentration might have an effect on nutrient
removal efﬁciency, biomass growth and settleability are largely
uncertain.
The object of the present study was to investigate the effects of
biotic (algal inoculum concentration) and abiotic factors (illumina-
tion cycle, mixing velocity and nutrient strength) on nutrient re-
moval, biomass accumulation and biomass settleability during
tertiary wastewater treatment with a mixed algal culture consist-
ing of three high-potential algal candidates.
2. Methods
2.1. Settleable microalgae cultivation
Three unicellular microalgae ( Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ,Scene-
desmus rubescens and Chlorella vulgaris ) which have high-potential
for wastewater treatment and are high in lipid content have been
selected. C. reinhardtii and S. rubescens were purchased from the
Institut für Getreideverarbeitung GmbH (Germany) and grown on
TAP and 1/2 Tamiya media at room temperature, respectively. C.
vulgaris was obtained from Scandinavian Culture Collection of
Algae and Protozoa (Denmark) and grown on a modiﬁed MWC
media at room temperature ( Zhang et al., 2011 ). The initial volatile
suspended solids (VSS) of the three algae cultures were around
0.8 g/l, respectively. The three algae species were cultivated
individually before carrying out all the tests. 5 L glass beakers were
used as photo-bioreactors with a consistent mixing (300 rpm, VWR
984VW0CSTEUS, USA). A ﬂuorescent lamp (Philips TL-D36w/840,
Poland) was used to irradiate from the side of the reactors in a
light: dark cycle of 12:12 h, to mimic natural solar day-night cycle,
with 7000 lux (measured at the side of bioreactor with TES-1335
Digital light meter). In order to cultivate the settleable algal cul-
ture, the mixing procedure was stopped every 23 h for 1 h and
the ﬂoating algae biomass was discarded with a screen (0.5 mm).
Two liters of wastewater, collected from the efﬂuent of the second
clariﬁer in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Holthusen
(Germany), was exchanged after sedimentation every 3 days to
maintain a nutrient supply. The characterization of the wastewaterused here was COD: 32.9 ± 3.0 (mg O 2/l), total kjeldahl nitrogen
(TKN): 48.4 ± 4.0 (mg N/l), NHþ
4—N: 45.2 ± 3.8 (mg/l), PO3/C0
4—P:
3.7 ± 0.6 (mg/l), NO/C0
3/C0—N: 5.8 ± 1.6 (mg/l), NO/C0
2—N: 1.8 ± 0.8
(mg/l), T: 22.3 ± 0.2 /C176C. After 1 month of cultivation, all the three
algae species showed good settleability (within 1 h).
2.2. Experimental operation
After individual cultivation, three algae suspensions ( C. rein-
hardtii ,S. rubescens ,C. vulgaris ) were centrifuged (10,000 /C2g),
washed 3 times with deionized water to remove the residual nutri-
ent. The mixed algal culture was obtained by mixing the three spe-
cies of microalgae in ratios of 1:1:1 (dry weight). In the test to
compare the nutrient removal rates with C. reinhardtii ,S. rubescens ,
C. vulgaris and mixed algal culture, the algal inoculum concentra-
tions were all 0.2 g/l (VSS). The same laboratory-scale reactor sys-
tem used for the cultivation process was used for the experiments.
The wastewater from the same location was used as feed for the
reactors in the following experiments unless otherwise stated.
The same lamp was used to irradiate the bioreactors with
7000 lux for a period of 12 h (7:00 to 19:00) per day unless other-
wise stated. In the test to investigate the inﬂuence of the illumina-
tion cycle, the same lamps ran for a period of 0 h (with reactor
covered with a black box to avoid natural light), 12 h (7:00 to
19:00) or 24 h per day. Constant mixing (300 rpm) was supplied
unless otherwise stated. In the test to investigate the inﬂuence of
mixing velocity, the same mixing devices were set at 0, 100 or
300 rpm. The mixed algae inoculum concentration was 0.2 g/l
(VSS), unless otherwise stated. In the test to investigate the inﬂu-
ence of the algal inoculum concentration, the mixed algae inocu-
lum concentrations were 0.2, 0.5 or 0.8 g/l (VSS). In order to test
the inﬂuence of nutrient strength, the above-mentioned wastewa-
ter and the same wastewater supplemented with 50 mg/l NHþ
4/C0N
and 8 mg/l PO3/C0
4—P were compared. To test algal biomass settlea-
bility under different light-dark cycles, mixing velocities, nutrient
strengths and algal inoculum concentrations, the turbidity of the
culture after 1 h of sedimentation was measured (Turbidity pho-
tometer, Dr. Lange, Type-Nr. LPG239, Germany) according to DIN
EN27027 ( DEV, 2002 ).
2.3. Analytical methods
The temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were measured
at around 12 o’clock near the middle of each reactor by using a dig-
ital multi parameter meter (Multi 3430 WTW, Germany) coupled
with an O 2sensor (CellOx 325, WTW, Germany) and a pH electrode
(pH SenTix 940, Germany). Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) and VSS
were analyzed according to DIN EN 25663-H11 and DIN ISO 11465
(DEV, 2002 ). NHþ
4, total phosphorus and dissolved phosphorus
ðPO3/C0
4Þwere determined according to DIN 38406-E5-1 and DIN
EN ISO 6878-D11 ( DEV, 2002 ) using an UV/Vis Spectrometer
(Perkin Elmer, Lambda 40, USA). NO 3/C0and NO 2/C0were determined
using an Ion Chromatograph (Dionex DX-100, USA) according to
DIN EN ISO 10304-1 ( DEV, 2002 ). Before analysis of the above
parameters in liquid, the samples were membrane ﬁltered
(0.45lm). To measure nitrogen or phosphorus in biomass, the
samples were ﬁrst divided into two identical parts. One part was
homogenized, while another part was ﬁltered to remove the solids.
Nitrogen or phosphorus in biomass was calculated as the total
nitrogen or phosphorus difference between the homogenized sam-
ples and the ﬁltered samples. All the experiments were performed
in duplicate. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was employed to
examine any signiﬁcant difference (at 0.05 level) among the
treatments.470 Y. Su et al. / Bioresource Technology 118 (2012) 469–4763. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparison of individual microalgae species and mixed algal
culture on nutrient removal
The nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates with C. reinhardtii ,
S. rubescens ,C. vulgaris and mixed algal culture are shown in Table
1.Table 1 indicates that the nutrient removal rates by using mixed
algal culture are higher than those of the three individual microal-
gae species, which show that the mixed algal culture could
enhance the nutrient removal capacity even the improvement is
not very signiﬁcant according to ANOVA analysis. Some research-
ers presumed that mixed cultures of certain favorable microalgae
candidates may improve the tolerance for environmental impacts,
exploit their own advantage and optimize the system performance
(Olguin, 2003 ). On the other hand, compared with pure cultivation,
mixed cultivation is cheap and easy to operate and maintain mak-
ing the wastewater treatment and algae cultivation more cost-
effective and efﬁcient. Therefore, the mixed algal culture was used
in the following tests.
3.2. Changes in pH and dissolved oxygen under different illumination
cycles
The effect of illumination cycles on the system performance
was investigated. The pH and DO of cultures under different illumi-
nation conditions are shown in Fig. 1 . In both reactors with contin-
uous and alternating illumination, the DO increased signiﬁcantly to
the peak value as soon as starting the batch test and became stable
till the end of the test. In the reactor without illumination, DO con-
centration remained stable during the ﬁrst two days and dropped
to around 0.5 mg/l afterward. This low DO level lasted for the fol-
lowing 5 days and then recovered to around 6 mg/l which was the
same as that of the beginning ( Fig. 1 a). The possible reason for thislow DO concentration in the reactor without illumination may be
the low algal autotrophic activity under dark condition and the
intensive nitriﬁcation process between day 2 and day 8 as shown
inFig. 2 c and d.
A shift in pH in the above processes was also observed. Reactor
with alternating illumination (12 h light per day) shifted up from
around 7.9 to 9.6 ( Fig. 1 b). The increase in pH was found to be
greater in the reactor under continuous illumination compared to
that in the reactor operated with alternating illumination. The
pH increase in the above two reactors (with illumination) could
be due to photosynthetic inorganic carbon uptake. This was also
consistent with the previous study that inorganic carbon uptake
led to a high pH of 9.5 ( Hende et al., 2011 ). Moreover, the contin-
uous illumination caused high photosynthesis activity thus leading
to a higher pH (above 10.6). In the reactor with no illumination, the
pH remained stable within the range of 8–9.

(12 or 24 h per day), a high removal of nitrogen and phosphate was
obtained after a similar detention time ( Fig. 2 ). Ammonium re-
moval efﬁciency was more than 98% for a detention time of 6
and 7 days in the reactors with continuous (24 h per day) and
alternating (12 h per day) illumination, respectively. The removal
of phosphate was almost 99% within 6 days for both the reactors.
The above results suggest that N and P removal was not signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced by continuous illumination. The possible reason
for this might be due to the outcome of long-term adaptation
and natural selection. Under the continuous and alternating illumi-
nation, the removal of nitrate and nitrite was a much slower

which needed 4 to 5 days more.
In the dark condition only 17.2% of phosphate was removed by
the end of the experiment (after 14 days). The ammonium removal
efﬁciency was around 90% after 8 days and became stable till the
end of the test. From the results of nitrogen removal, it was obvi-
ous that the removed ammonium was completely transferred to
nitrate through nitriﬁcation process under dark condition
(Fig. 2 a, c and d). Some microalgal species (such as Chlorella and
Scenedesmus ) have the ability to switch between phototrophic
and heterotrophic metabolism, depending on environmental con-
ditions ( Perez-Garcia et al., 2011 ). But the shortage of organic car-
bon source in the efﬂuent of the secondary clariﬁer used here
might inhibit the heterotrophic metabolism.
The mean biomass generation rates for the reactors with 0, 12
and 24 h illumination per day were 0.93 ± 0.1, 7.51 ± 0.2
and 9.38 ± 0.1 g/m2/d, respectively ( Table 2 ). The algal biomasssettleability after 1 h sedimentation was also investigated. The cor-
responding turbidities were 9.2 ± 2.0, 4.8 ± 2.0 and 5.2 ± 1.8 FTU for
the reactors with 0, 12 and 24 h illumination per day, respectively
(Table 2 ).
The above results show that one of the key issues for algal auto-
trophic activity which may affect the nutrient removal is the illu-
mination. No signiﬁcant difference in the nutrient removal
between alternating and continuous illumination was observed,
which was consistent with the previous study ( Zhang et al., 2011 ).
3.4. Changes in pH and dissolved oxygen under different mixing
velocities
The changes of DO and pH with different mixing velocities (0,
100 and 300 rpm) were determined ( Fig. 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3 , dif-
ferent mixing velocities had an effect on DO trends and peak value.
For the reactor with 300 rpm, the DO increased from 5.8 to05101520253035404550

reactor with 100 rpm, the same rise trend was observed (from 5.1
to 17.6 mg/l) for the ﬁrst day. But this high DO level was only ob-
served for one day and then it dropped to around 15 mg/l and be-
came stable during the following 10 days. Finally, it decreased to
12 mg/l in the 11th day and kept this value till the end of the test.
The possible reason for the difference in DO between 100 and
300 rpm mixing velocity after the ﬁrst day may be that low mixing
velocity could not supply enough periodic illumination to the algal
cell thus resulted in low algal autotrophic activity and low DO. Be-
sides, nitriﬁers (autotrophic) might show high activity under
100 rpm mixing velocity thus resulted in low DO. For the reactor
without mixing, the DO increased from 5.63 to 12 mg/l within
3 days and remained stable till the end of the test.
A similar pH trend which increased from 7.7 ± 0.3 to 9.6 ± 0.1
was appeared in the reactors with 0, 100 and 300 rpm mixing
velocities ( Fig. 3 b). There are several factors inﬂuencing the culture
pH, and the ﬁnal pH in the above reactors is a result of a combina-
tion of factors. Algal photosynthesis could cause culture pH to risethrough removing carbon dioxide from the water ( Oswald, 1988 ).
Nitriﬁcation process and ammonium consumption, the pH is acid
due to H+releasing ( Gonzalez et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010a ). In addi-
tion, nitrate consumption by denitriﬁcation could cause an in-
crease in pH ( Perez-Garcia et al., 2011 ). Overall, different mixing
velocities had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on pH.
3.5. Nutrient removal, algal biomass production and settleability under
different mixing velocities
Nitrogen and phosphorus removal under different mixing
velocities was also investigated. Nearly no ammonium was de-
tected after 7, 9 and 14 days for the reactors with mixing velocity
of 300, 100 and 0 rpm, respectively ( Fig. 4 a). The ammonium re-
moval was probably due to algal uptake and ammonia stripping
at high pH value ( Munoz and Guieysse, 2006 ). The mean initial
concentrations of NO/C0
3—N andNO/C0
2—N were 7.1 ± 0.2 and
1.2 ± 0.1 mg/l respectively for the three reactors. For the reactor
with 300 rpm, the NO/C0

2—N (2.7 ± 0.2 mg/l) was detected in the 7 days.
But they were both removed afterwards through algal uptake or
partly denitriﬁcation, resulting in total nitrogen removal efﬁciency
above 99% at the end of the batch run ( Fig. 4 c and d). Obviously,
microalgae prefer to use ammonium as nitrogen source when
ammonium, nitrate and nitrite are all available in the medium.
Similar results were reported in the literature showing that the or-
der of using a nitrogen source by most microalgal species is, in
declining order: ammonium > nitrate > nitrite > urea ( Perez-Garcia
et al., 2011 ). Around 10 ± 0.1 mg/l of NO/C0
3—N and 5.5 ± 0.2 mg/l of
NO/C0
2—N were detected at the end of the test in the reactor with
100 rpm. Similarly, the ﬁnal values of NO/C0
3—N and NO/C0
2—N were
10.8 ± 0.2 and 7.7 ± 0.1 mg/l respectively when no mixing was pro-
vided which shows that around 8.4% and 15.2% of inlet ammonium
was converted to nitrate or nitrite through nitriﬁcation processes.
Similarly, PO3/C0
4/C0P decreased gradually from 3.1 ± 0.1 to
0.1 ± 0.1 mg/l with different retention times (5 days for 300 rpm,
10 days for 100 rpm and 11 days for 0 rpm). The removal efﬁciency
of phosphate was above 98% in each case. The removal of phos-
phate was a faster process compared to that observed for ammo-
nium, but the same general pattern was apparent ( Fig. 2 a and b,
Fig. 4 a and b). The opposite result has been reported in previous
studies that phosphate removal process was a few days slower
than that of ammonium removal ( Su et al., 2012; Zhang et al.,
2011 ). This contradiction may be due to the fact that the N/P ratio
of the wastewater used in the present study was around 15:1 and
much higher than that of the previous studies (around 5:1). Unlike
illumination, mixing velocity had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on phos-
phate removal ( p> 0.05, ANOVA analysis), but did affect retention
time needed to reach the same percentage. The biomass generation
rate was 1.53 ± 0.2, 2.49 ± 0.1 and 7.51 ± 0.2 g/m2/d for the reactors
with 0, 100 and 300 rpm of mixing velocity, respectively ( Table 2 ).
The turbidities after 1 h sedimentation were 6.8 ± 1.7, 6.0 ± 1.7 and
4.8 ± 2.0 FTU for the reactors with 0, 100 and 300 rpm of mixing
velocity, respectively ( Table 2 ).
3.6. Changes in pH and dissolved oxygen with different algal inoculum
concentrations for low and high nutrient strength wastewater
treatment
The changes of culture pH and dissolved oxygen under different
algal inoculum concentrations for low and high nutrient strength
wastewater treatment are shown in Fig. 5 . During the ﬁrst 4 days,
the pH increased from around 7.8–8.8 in each of the six reactors.
After that, the trends of pH between low and high nutrient strength
were quite different. For the three reactors with high nutrient
strength, a drop in pH (below 9) was observed in the reactors with
different algal inoculum concentrations. The reactors with low
nutrient strength showed a similar pH level which increased
gradually to around 9.6. As mentioned in Section 3.4, the culturepH was the result of several factors. It was clear that the different
nutrient strength had signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the culture pH. For
the low nutrient concentration, the culture pH was independent
of the algal inoculum concentration. However, for the high nutrient
concentration, different pH levels were observed for different algal
inoculum concentrations.
At the beginning of the test, the DO level was the same as that of
the pretreated wastewater. When starting the batch run, for the al-
gal inoculum concentration of 0.2 g/l in low nutrient strength, the
DO increased signiﬁcantly to around 18 mg/l and became stable till
the end of the experiment. For the other two reactors with 0.5 and
0.8 g/l in low nutrient strength wastewater, after the rise in DO at
the beginning of the run, a gradual increase was recorded till the
end of the experiment. For the reactors with 0.2 g/l algal inoculum
concentration in high nutrient strength wastewater, the DO in-
creased slightly till the 6th day, dropped in the following 3 days
and became steady until the end of the experiment. For the reac-
tors with 0.5 and 0.8 g/l in high nutrient strength wastewater,
the DO increased during the ﬁrst 3 days, then decreased till the
5th to 6th day and became stable. The drop of DO in the reactors
with high nutrient concentration may be due to the intensive
nitriﬁcation.
3.7. Nutrient removal, algal biomass production and settleability with
different algal inoculum concentrations for low and high nutrient
strength wastewater treatment
The nutrient removal performance was further tested with dif-
ferent algal inoculum concentrations under both low and high
strength wastewater. The results are presented in Table 3 . For
the wastewater of low nutrient strength (around 53 mg N/l and
4 mg P/l), an above 98% nitrogen removal efﬁciency was achieved
within 9, 5 and 4 days for the reactors with algal inoculum concen-
trations of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/l, respectively, leading to a daily nitro-
gen removal rate of 5.4 ± 0.2, 9.1 ± 0.3 and 10.8 ± 0.3 mg/l/d,
respectively. It was clear that the better nitrogen removal efﬁcien-
cies were obtained with all the tested algal inoculum concentra-
tions for low nutrient wastewater treatment but the higher algal
inoculum concentration led to higher nitrogen removal rates. Sim-
ilarly, nearly 100% of phosphate removal efﬁciencies were obtained
within 7, 7 and 6 days for the reactors with algal inoculum concen-
trations of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/l, respectively. The corresponding
phosphorus removal rates were 0.57 ± 0.03, 0.56 ± 0.03 and
0.72 ± 0.05 mg/l/d, respectively. The above results indicated that
the removal of phosphorus was independent of the algal inoculum
concentration when treating the wastewater in the low strength
wastewater. Similar P removal efﬁciencies and rates were achieved
for the three tested algal inoculum concentrations (0.2, 0.5 and
0.8 g/l). However, the mean biomass generation rates were differ-
ent (7.51 ± 0.2, 2.54 ± 0.2 and 1.46 ± 0.2 g/m2/d) for the algal

lowest algal inoculum concentration (0.2 g/l) led to a higher
biomass generation rate which had greater potential for algal cul-
tivation. The wastewater used here is within the normal nutrient
concentration range of wastewater from the secondary treatment
worldwide. The results show that the mixed algal culture could
potentially be employed for combined wastewater tertiary treat-
ment and biofuel production.
In order to investigate the effect of nutrient concentration on
the removal performance, biomass accumulation and settleability,
the same three algal inoculum concentrations were also tested
with wastewater of high nutrient strength (around 97 mg N/l and
11.5 mg P/l). The nitrogen removal efﬁciency reached up to
52.8 ± 3.8%, 53.6 ± 3.8% and 41.2 ± 4.0% during the ﬁrst 8 days
and then became stable until the end of the test (14 days) for the
reactors with algal inoculum concentrations of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/
l, respectively. Similarly, only 43.6 ± 2.8%, 14.3 ± 4.0% and
12.2 ± 3.3% of phosphorus were removed for the reactors with algal
inoculum concentration of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/l, respectively. The ob-
served removal efﬁciencies were much lower than those for the
wastewater in low nutrient wastewater. The NHþ
4/C0N removal
rates were 4.8 ± 0.2, 4.8 ± 0.1 and 4.4 ± 0.2 mg/l/d and the phos-
phorus removal rates were 0.36 ± 0.03, 0.12 ± 0.04 and
0.10 ± 0.03 mg/l/d for the reactors with the algal inoculum concen-
tration of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/l, respectively. It was noticed that the
high nutrient strength wastewater led to poor nutrient removal
performance. Previous studies showed that microalgae Chlorella
sp. could well purify highly concentrated municipal wastewater
(around COD: 2300 mg/l; TN: 120 mg/l and TP 212 mg/l) within
15 days ( Li et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011 ). The possible reason for
this may be due to the different nutrient composition of the waste-
water (high COD concentration in the previous study) and algal
domestication. In addition, the biomass generation rates were
7.27 ± 0.1, 2.40 ± 0.2 and 1.44 ± 0.2 g/m2/d for the reactors with al-
gal inoculum concentration of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/l, which was sim-
ilar with that of low nutrient concentration.
Obviously, for both low and high strength wastewater, the reac-
tor with the same algal inoculum concentration showed the similar
biomass generation capacities ( Table 2 ), indicating that there wasno strong relationship between nutrient strength in wastewater
and algal growth rate. In addition, lower algal inoculum concentra-
tion led to higher biomass accumulation rate. There were two pos-
sible reasons for this phenomenon. First, the available nutrient per
algal cell was high at low algal inoculum concentration which
would promote the algal growth. Second, higher algal inoculum
concentration may lead to mutual shading within the algal popula-
tion and lower the algal growth ( Guieysse et al., 2002 ). The similar
results were also found in previous studies ( Yuan et al., 2011 ),
which showed that initial algal inoculation concentration was the
key factor for the further biomass accumulation.
At the end of the test, the settleabilities of the algal biomass
with different algal inoculum concentrations for treating low and
high strength of secondary wastewater were investigated ( Table
2). Obviously, the culture with all the algal inoculum concentra-
tions for low strength wastewater treatment showed the similar
and good settleability after 1 h sedimentation (0.2 g/l: 4.8 ± 2.0
FTU; 0.5 g/l: 2.8 ± 1.7 FTU and 0.8 g/l: 1.8 ± 1.6 FTU). The algal bio-
mass from the reactor with 0.2 g/l algal inoculum concentration for
high strength wastewater treatment also showed a good settleabil-
ity, which was around 4.3 FTU after 1 h sedimentation. The culture
with 0.5 and 0.8 g/l initial algal concentrations for high strength
wastewater treatment had the poor settleability (9.0 ± 1.8 and
10.8 ± 1.6 FTU, respectively). The above results indicate that the
biomass settleability would decrease with the increase of the algal
inoculum concentration under high strength wastewater, and
there was no strong relationship between the initial biomass con-
centration and biomass settleability when treating low strength
wastewater. The relatively higher availability of nitrogen and phos-
phorus in high nutrient strength wastewater, together with the
higher algal inoculum concentration could lead to different algal
cell composition and lipid content ( Li et al., 2010b ), which might
result in the lower settleability.
3.8. Nitrogen and phosphorus balance under different conditions
Certain conditions with high nutrient removal efﬁciencies
which were worthy to be used were further investigated for the
nitrogen and phosphorus balance. From Table 4 , biomass uptakeTable 3

aAmmonia stripping and denitriﬁcation.Y. Su et al. / Bioresource Technology 118 (2012) 469–476 475was the main N removal mechanism which accounted for more
than 61.8% of inlet N for reactors 1 and 90% of the inlet N for the
other reactors. Ammonia stripping usually occurring at high pH
is also depended on temperature of air and wastewater ( Liao
et al., 1995 ). And it was slight in this system as most of the ammo-
nium was already removed before that pH was above 9.5. Besides,
denitriﬁcation process did not play an important role as the high
DO and low organic carbon concentration would not promote the
intensive denitriﬁcation. For the reactor 1, 28.1 ± 1.2% of inlet
nitrogen was converted to NO 3/C0and NO 2/C0through nitriﬁcation.
Based on the P mass balance, uptake through algae and phosphorus
precipitant were the main P removal mechanisms in all the tested
reactors which accounted for more than 96%, and P precipitant
would only take place at high pH (9–11). Before the increase of
pH (above 9), more than 61% of inlet P was already removed
through algal uptake in the reactor of 2 and 3. For reactor of 1, 4
and 5, around 36%, 53.2% and 50.0% of inlet P was removed before
that pH was above 9.
4. Conclusion
A mixed algal culture, constituted of three high-potential uni-
cellular microalgae, was investigated in terms of nutrient removal,
biomass production and settleability. This study showed that the
mixed culture of certain favorable microalgae candidates may en-
hance the nutrient removal from wastewater. Illumination cycle
and mixing velocity can inﬂuence the nutrient removal and bio-
mass generation. 98% and 99% of total nitrogen and phosphate re-
moval and a good settleability were obtained for the algal
inoculum concentration of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 g/l for low strength
wastewater.
