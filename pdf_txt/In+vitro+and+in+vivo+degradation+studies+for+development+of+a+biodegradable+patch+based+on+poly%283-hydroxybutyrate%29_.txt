Abstract: Biopolymers have been the most frequently studied class of materials due to their biodegrad-
ability, renewability, and sustainability. The main aim of the presented study was to evaluate degrad-
ability of the polymer material blend which was immersed in different solutions. The present study
included the production of three different mixtures of polylactic acid and polyhydroxybutyrate, each
with a different content of triacetin, which was used as a plasticiser. Applying 3D printing technology,
two types of cylindrical specimen were produced, i.e., a solid and a porous specimen, and subjected to
in vitro natural degradation. The biodegradation process ran for 195 days in three different solutions
(saline, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Hank‚Äôs solution) in stable conditions of 37C and a
pH of 7.4, while the specimens were kept in an orbital motion to simulate the Ô¨Çow of Ô¨Çuids. The
goal was to identify the effects of a solution type, specimen shape and material composition on
the biodegradation of the materials. The monitored parameters included changes in the solution
quantity absorbed by the specimens; morphological changes in the specimen structure; and mechani-
cal properties. They were measured by compressive testing using the Inspekt5 Table Blue testing
device. The experiment revealed that specimen porosity affected the absorption of the solutions. The
non-triacetin materials exhibited a higher mechanical resistance to compression than the materials
containing a plasticiser. The Ô¨Ånal result of the experiment indicated that the plasticiser-free specimens
exhibited higher values of solution absorption, no formation of block cracks or bubbles, and the
pH values of the solutions in which these materials were immersed remained neutral for the entire
experiment duration; furthermore, these materials did not reduce pH values down to the alkaline
range, as was the case with the solutions with the plasticiser-containing materials. Generally, in
applications where high mechanical resistance, earlier degradation, and more stable conditions are
required, the use of non-plasticiser materials is recommended.

1. Introduction
Degradation is generally deÔ¨Åned as a loss of relevant properties of a material which
develops gradually as a result of an exposure to external conditions [ 1]. As a matter of fact,
degradation of biomaterials represents one of the biggest problems in the Ô¨Åeld of regenera-
tive medicine. In bioengineering, the degradation may be both desired and undesired. In
both cases, knowledge of the degradation kinetics is essential for the safe use of biocompo-
nents [ 1]. Processes leading to the degradation of materials may generally be categorised as
Polymers 2021 ,13, 1542. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13101542 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymersPolymers 2021 ,13, 1542 2 of 17
volumetric and surface processes. The factors affecting the volumetric degradation include
an operating temperature, mechanical load and electromagnetic radiation [2].
Biomaterials, such as metals, alloys, polymers, ceramics, and composites, degrade
when exposed to a strongly aggressive in vivo environment. Undesired degradation leads
to the wear, corrosion, deformation, creep, fatigue, fracture and oxidation of biomaterials.
Degradation may also be affected by sterilisation, to which these materials may be exposed.
If a biomaterial is degraded, certain changes occur in its structure and subsequently in its
properties [ 3]. In the regenerative medicine, there is a trend to replace natural biological
materials with biomaterials where the biodegradation is desired in order to achieve a
scheduled degradation of materials along with the concurrent formation of new tissues.
Polymers belong to the most frequently used classes of biomaterial because their
properties may be modiÔ¨Åed as required by various additives, depending on a particular
biological application [ 4]. Degradation of polymers may be induced by thermal activation,
oxidation, photolysis, radiolysis, or hydrolysis (Figure 1). If the degradation is affected by
the biological environment, it may also be referred to as biodegradation [ 5]. A plasticiser
content may affect the degradation of a material. In a study performed by Pelegriny
et al., they used the same type of a plasticiser as that used in the present study; it may
be stated that triacetin inhibits the PLA degradation up to 45 days after the exposure,
and afterwards it no longer inÔ¨Çuences the degradation process [ 6]. Similar results were
obtained by Darabian et al.; in their study, they examined two different plasticisers. As to
the absorption, the results clearly showed that a similar phenomenon has been observed
in the samples containing polylactic acid (PLA) and TAC, in particular that the water
absorbency increases with an increasing TAC [7].
Figure 1. Schematic presentation of polymer degradation.
Relevant experiments may be carried out using two types of in vitro biodegradation
accelerated or natural [ 8]. An advantage of the accelerated degradation is that results are
achieved quickly, whereas the natural degradation is often used as a control. Polymeric
biomaterials may be degraded either by hydrolytic degradation in a reaction with hydro-
gen peroxide (H 2O2), or by oxidative degradation, in which free radicals generated by a
polymer directly initiate the oxidation of such a polymer [ 9]. This material has been sub-
jected to the investigation because it is extensively used and due to its suitable mechanical
properties and a possibility of being modiÔ¨Åed [ 10]. The purpose of the present study was
to examine the biodegradability of polymer blends of polylactic acid and polyhydroxybu-
tyrate (PLA/PHB), while using triacetin (TAC) as a plasticiser, in the conditions simulating
a human organism. Natural biodegradation of the three types of materials with differ-
ent TAC concentrations was selected for this experiment. The specimens produced from
these materials by 3D printing were subjected to natural biodegradation in vitro , while the
monitored parameters included the absorption, weight loss, morphological changes, and
mechanical properties.Polymers 2021 ,13, 1542 3 of 17
2. Materials and Methods
Laboratory biodegradation was facilitated using a biodegradable polymer blend of
PLA/PHB, at the ratio of 85/15, containing TAC as a plasticiser in the amounts of 0%, 5%
and 10% of the total volume.
2.1. Preparation of Materials, Specimen Designing and 3D Printing
The modelling and subsequent 3D printing were carried out using the following
software products: Magics (Materialise, Gent, Belgium) for designing, modelling and
structuring the specimens; Bioplotter RP (Envisiontec, Dearborn, MI, USA) and Visual
Machines (Envisionec, Dearborn, MI, USA) for slicing the specimens and placing them
on the platform. Prior to the 3D printing, each type of the blend material in form of a
granulate with a weight of approximately 10 g was inserted into the Radwag MA50/1
moisture analyser (RADWAG, Radom, Poland) where they were dried for 60 min at a
temperature of 80C. Drying was aimed at removing excess water molecules from the
material and ensuring the durability of the material for the entire printing process. Drying
was carried out due to hydrophilic properties of the PHB component [ 11]. Both the porous
and solid specimens were designed in a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 6 mm and a
height of 2 mm . The thickness of the layer represented 80% of the nozzle diameter (600 m),
i.e., 480 m.
In both types of specimen, the individual layers were turned 90relative to the lower
layer. The distance between the centres of the individual Ô¨Åbres which formed the inner
inÔ¨Åll was 1.2 mm in porous specimens and 0.6 mm in solid specimens.
The 3D Bioplotter EnvisionTEC (EnvisionTEC, Dearborn, MI, USA) uses the EBB
(extrusion-based bioprinting) principle, i.e., a material is pneumatically pushed out of
the print head. Table 1 contains the determined parameters for 3D printing of specimens
for each material type. The total number of printed specimens was 168, and they were
immersed in individual solutions in groups of 7 specimens, whereas 7 porous and 7 solid
specimens were used as the reference specimens.

2.2. Immersion of Specimens in Solutions
The experiment was carried out as natural biodegradation with three types of biodegra-
dation media: saline solution (SS); phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); and Hank‚Äôs solution
(HS). The 3D-printed specimens were immersed in these solutions in a volume of 40 mL
and a pH value of 7.4, and then placed on the platform of the Orbital Shaker PSU-10i
(BioSan, R ¬Øƒ±ga, Latvia), which simulated the Ô¨Çow of Ô¨Çuids during the entire experiment.
The device was placed in a heated Binder incubator (Otto Bock Healthcare, Duderstadt,
Germany) with a constant temperature of 37C.
2.3. Experimental Biodegradation
The materials were exposed to biodegradation for 195 days in constant conditions a
temperature of 37C; a solution pH of 7.4, and a stirring speed of 160 rpm. The specimen
weight loss and the solution pH parameters were monitored and measured at regular
15-day intervals, whereas the pH was always adjusted back to 7.4. The pH values were
measured using the Mettler Toledo pH meter (Mettler-Toledo, Bratislava, Slovak Republic).Polymers 2021 ,13, 1542 4 of 17
2.4. Weight Analysis and Calculation of Absorption
During the experiment, the specimens were regularly taken out of the solutions at
15-day intervals. The Ô¨Çuid on their surface was removed using the Ô¨Åltration paper and
the specimens were weighed. The absorption percentage of the specimens was calculated
using the following formula (Guo, Yang, Zhou, Chen, and Li, 2017):
Sw=
wwet wdry
wdry100[%] (1)
The absorption of the solutions by the specimens and by the granulates is characterised
as the swelling percentage S w, wherein W wetis the weight of a specimen on a particular
day during the biodegradation; W dryis the weight of a specimen prior to biodegradation,
i.e., the weight of a specimen immediately after 3D printing, before it is Ô¨Årst immersed in
a solution.
2.5. Monitoring of Morphological Changes
During the experiment, morphological changes were monitored using the KEYENCE
VHX-5000 microscope (Keyence, Mechelen, Belgium). The specimens were examined for
the Ô¨Åbre width and spacing, and the structure on the Ô¨Åbre surface. Changes in the Ô¨Åbre
width were examined at 100 magniÔ¨Åcation on selected specimens of each material type,
porous and solid, at the maximum absorption of the solution. In order to monitor all physi-
cal changes of the specimens, they were initially scanned at 30 and 50 magniÔ¨Åcations.
At 100 magniÔ¨Åcation, the Ô¨Åbre width and spacing were examined. The same magniÔ¨Åca-
tion was applied when creating 3D models of the central sections of all specimens, which
were then used to evaluate and graphically depict the changes in individual structures.
Eventually, the surface of one Ô¨Åbre was scanned at 300 magniÔ¨Åcation.
2.6. Mechanical Testing
The mechanical compressive properties were determined using the uniaxial universal
machine Inspekt5 Table Blue by Hegewald and Peschke (Nossen, Germany). The maximum
load of the equipment was 5 kN. Each test specimen was Ô¨Åxed between the jaws and
exposed to the pressure exerted by a crosshead travelling at a speed of 0.4 mm/s, while the
force was applied until the specimen was completely deformed. The specimens selected for
such testing were those immersed in solutions and not subjected to a microscopic analysis.
All the specimens were tested in identical testing conditions. The output graphs
contain the indications of the points where a specimen exhibited the Ô¨Årst deformation.
Later on, when the compression force continued, the deformed specimens only exhibited
the effects of the compression. For the purpose of calculating the strain at which the
deformation of a specimen occurred, it was necessary to know not only the force magnitude,
but also the specimen‚Äôs compression surface area. The surface area of a solid specimen
was 2.826 10 5m2. The surface area of a porous specimen was measured using the
ZEISS Metrotom 1500 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The volume of a solid specimen
was 54.606 mm3, and the volume of a porous specimen was 42.437 mm3. A difference in
their volumes was 12.169 mm3. It means that the porous specimen represented 77.71% of
the solid specimen‚Äôs volume. The surface area of the porous specimen was calculated as
80% of the solid specimen‚Äôs surface area. The surface area of the porous specimen was
2.26110 5m2.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Evaluation of the Measured pH of Solutions
The measured pH values of the solutions indicated that the materials with different
contents of a plasticiser (TAC) exhibited signiÔ¨Åcant differences in pH (Table 2). Greater
Ô¨Çuctuations of pH to the neutral or slightly alkaline ranges were observed in PLA/PHB
5TAC and PLA/PHB 10TAC immersed in SS and HS. The PLA/PHB 0TAC materialPolymers 2021 ,13, 1542 5 of 17
immersed in HS initially induced basicity of the solution, but as the degradation advanced,
the pH value stabilised. The pH value of the saline solution containing the immersed
PLA/PHB 0TAC was almost always reduced (to almost the same value of approximately
6.8). The most stable pH values during the entire degradation process were observed
in PBS, including the cases when the plasticiser concentrations in the basic materials
were different.

3.2. Comparison of Solution Absorptions
An increase in the weight of each specimen immersed in a solution was directly pro-
portional to an increase in the absorption. The graphs in Figure 2 show a gradual increase
in the absorption of the solutions. The absorption by porous specimens immersed in SS was
signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the absorption by solid specimens immersed in the same solution.
The average value of absorption by solid specimens was 3.8076%, while the average value
of absorption by porous specimens was 5.1966%. A difference in the absorption values was
also reÔ¨Çected in the ratio of a plasticiser content to the basic PLA/PHB material. In these
specimens, the absorption of the solution increased with an increasing concentration of a
plasticiser. Out of all specimens, the highest absorption value was observed in the porous
specimen made of PLA/PHB 5TAC, i.e., 10.495%. The lowest absorption of SS (0.027%)
was observed in the porous specimen made of PLA/PHB 0TAC.
The absorption by porous specimens immersed in PBS was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than
the absorption by solid specimens immersed in the same solution. The average value
of absorption of all solid specimens was 2.3423%, while the average value of absorption
of all porous specimens was 5.8873%. When compared to the remaining specimens, the
porous specimens with the highest contents of a plasticiser (PLA/PHB 10TAC) absorbed
the highest amount of solution. The solid specimens made of the same material exhibited
the lowest absorption value of all solid specimens immersed in PBS. The plasticiser-free
specimens also exhibited a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the absorption values of the solid
and porous specimens. The highest absorption value out of all specimens was observed
in the porous specimen made of PLA/PHB 10TAC, in particular 12.676%. The lowest
absorption by a specimen immersed in PBS was  1.089%, and it was observed in the
porous specimen made of PLA/PHB 5TAC. This value was negative due to the fact that
the weight of the specimen, as measured after it was taken out of the solution, dried and
weighed on an analytical balance, was lower than its weight measured immediately after it
was printed out.Polymers 2021 ,13, 1542 6 of 17
Figure 2. Curves of changes in the absorption of individual solutions by the specimens.
When compared to the other specimens immersed in HS, the specimens without a
plasticiser, both compact and porous, absorbed the highest amounts of the solution. The
specimens immersed in HS exhibited the lowest average absorption value. In particular,
solid specimens made of PLA/PHB 5TAC and solid specimens made of PLA/PHB 10TAC
exhibited the lowest values of absorption out of all specimens. The absorption value
was negative because the weight of the specimen, as measured after it was taken out
of the solution, dried and weighed on an analytical balance, was lower than its weight
measured immediately after it was printed out. The highest absorption out of all specimens
was observed in the porous specimen made of PLA/PHB 0TAC, representing 9.02%.
The lowest absorption of HS (  3.559%) was observed in the porous specimen made of
PLA/PHB 10TAC.
The impact of the absorption on the specimens was also visible on their surface. After
they were taken out of the solutions, the majority of them exhibited surface cracks. In
all materials, the colour of the specimens was changed. Also, during the degradation,
an additional layer of the material formed in the lower part of the specimens, probably
due to the heat and the effects of a solution and a plasticiser. In some of the specimens,
this resulted in a loss of porosity (Figure 3). Generally, the specimens exhibited a higher
brittleness at even a simple manipulation operation.Polymers 2021 ,13, 1542 7 of 17

absorption of solutions by the specimens on the morphological changes observed during the degradation.Polymers 2021 ,13, 1542 8 of 17
3.3. Evaluation of the Measured Parameters by a Statistical Analysis
For the purpose of evaluating the types of material and solution which were used in
the experiment, three speciÔ¨Åc evaluations were carried out: the effects of a specimen shape;
the effects of a solution; and the effects of a plasticiser. The Ô¨Årst step of the evaluation was
testing the conditions necessary for the use of parametric or non-parametric tests.
The evaluation of specimen shapes was carried out using the non-parametric Mann‚Äì
Whitney test, which conÔ¨Årmed that the changes in the weights of the specimens were
caused by their shapes, and that this also affected the absorption as such (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Graphical representation of the specimen shapes in terms of their statistical signiÔ¨Åcance.
The evaluation of the effects of a solution type was carried out using the Kruskal‚Äì
Wallis test and a post-hoc analysis as an alternative to a one-factor analysis of variance.
If a p-value is lower than a selected signiÔ¨Åcance level, the null hypothesis is rejected;
this means that a difference between two medians in at least one pair, as calculated for
a particular specimen, is too big to be attributable merely to a random selection. The
testing revealed that the solutions affected the changes in the weights of the specimens.
No statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences were observed between the solid specimens made
of PLA/PHB 5TAC which were immersed in SS and those immersed in HS; or betweenPolymers 2021 ,13, 1542 9 of 17
the solid specimens made of PLA/PHB 10TAC which were immersed in SS and those
immersed in PBS; or between the porous specimens made of PLA/PHB 0TAC which were
immersed in PBS and those immersed in HS; or between the porous specimens made
of PLA/PHB 5TAC which were immersed in SS and those immersed in HS. Statistically
important differences were observed among all solid specimens made of PLA/PHB 0TAC,
and among all porous specimens made of PLA/PHB 10TAC.
As for the evaluation of the effects of a plasticiser, it focused on the effects of the
plasticiser contained in a material on identical solutions and identical specimen shapes;
the total number of the performed tests was 6. The evaluation of the effects of a plasticiser
was carried out using the Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test, which conÔ¨Årmed again that the plasticiser
(0%, 5%, and 10%) affected the changes in individual weights. No statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
differences were observed for the porous specimens made of PLA/PHB 0TAC or PLA/PHB
10TAC which were immersed in SS; or for the porous specimens made of PLA/PHB
0TAC or PLA/PHB 5TAC which were immersed in PBS. However, statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
differences were observed for this particular solution in all solid specimens immersed in
PBS. As for the solid specimens made of PLA/PHB 0TAC or PLA/PHB 5TAC which were
immersed in HS and the porous specimens made of PLA/PHB 5TAC or PLA/PHB 10TAC
which were immersed in HS, there were no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences.
3.4. Morphological Changes in the Specimens
In terms of morphological changes, the focus of the monitoring was on the changes in
the surface of the individual specimens and on the changes in the width of the extruded
Ô¨Åbres. The most signiÔ¨Åcant change in the Ô¨Åbre width was observed in the solid specimens
made of PLA/PHB 0TAC, which exhibited a Ô¨Åbre width after degradation as low as
approximately 1 mm. An increased Ô¨Åbre width was observed in the porous specimens
made of PLA/PHB 0TAC; this material did not contain a plasticiser and was immersed in
all three solutions. The only negative value, i.e., a decrease in the Ô¨Åbre width, was observed
in the porous specimen made of PLA/PHB 5TAC, which degraded in SS (Table 3 ). This
decrease in the Ô¨Åbre width might have been caused by the fact that the specimen lost
its porosity after degradation because a Ô¨Ålm of a material was formed in its lower layer.
This Ô¨Ålm was probably formed from a certain portion of the material released from the
individual Ô¨Åbres of the specimen, and that is why the width of the Ô¨Åbres decreased. A
macroscopic image of the specimen shows a visible Ô¨Ålm formed in the lower part of the
specimen (Figure 5A). A 3D image of the central part was subsequently used to create the
cross-sections of individual parts (Figure 5B). The graph represents the development of the
surface. If the specimen was porous and with no Ô¨Ålm, the lower value in the graph would
be 0m. However, this graph of the surface development conÔ¨Årms the presence of the Ô¨Ålm
at the height of approximately 400 m (Figure 5C).
The distance between the individual Ô¨Åbres in solid specimens should be 0 m, and
in porous specimens it should be 600 m. This means that every value that was lower
than 600 m in porous specimens indicates an increase in the Ô¨Åbre width and a consequent
decrease in a distance between two Ô¨Åbres. This indicates that the solution was absorbed by
the Ô¨Åbres (Table 3). All negative values contained in Table 3 indicate the reduced distances
between the Ô¨Åbres. A positive value of the difference means that the distance between the
Ô¨Åbres increased. The difference represents the value after biodegradation in the solutions
relative to the specimens prior to biodegradation.
Degradation of specimens was also conÔ¨Årmed in one more aspect. As there were
three types of material and three types of solution, it was assumed that each material may
behave differently in a different solution, even after a specimen is taken out of the solution.
In our case, the solid specimens made of PLA/PHB 0TAC which were immersed in the
saline solution and the solid specimens made of PLA/PHB 10TAC which were immersed
in PBS exhibited the formation of block cracks and bubbles (Figure 5D). These changes
were not visible while the specimens were still immersed in the solutions. After they werePolymers 2021 ,13, 1542 10 of 17
taken out and dried, their surface exhibited some block cracks and bubble-like lighter areas
visible to the naked eye.
3.5. Mechanical Testing
Based on the values at which the specimens exhibited deformation, a general conclu-
sion may be made that the plasticiser-free specimens were more resistant to compression,
regardless of the solution they were immersed in.
3.5.1. Saline Solution
The highest strain value was observed for the solid specimens without a plasticiser.
Even though the strain value of the porous specimen made of PLA/PHB 0TAC was
signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than the strain of the solid specimens made of the same material, this
value was always higher than that of the porous specimens containing a plasticiser. As for
the specimens containing a plasticiser, the solid specimens exhibited deformation earlier
than the porous ones. This might have been caused by the presence of block cracks in the
specimens after drying. With regard to the specimens immersed in the saline solution, it is
possible to state that as a concentration of the plasticiser increased, the value of strain at
which the deformation occurred decreased (Figure 6).
3.5.2. Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS)
The highest value of the strain was observed for the porous specimens that did not
contain a plasticiser. Although the strain value of the solid specimen made of PLA/PHB
0TAC was lower than the strain of the porous specimens made of the same material, this
value was always higher than the value measured in the solid specimens containing a
plasticiser. As for the specimens containing the plasticiser, the solid specimens exhibited
deformation earlier than the porous ones. With the use of this type of solution, it was
observed that the specimens made of PLA/PHB 5TAC exhibited deformation earlier
than those made of PLA/PHB 10TAC. Contrary to the Ô¨Ånding made with SS, it was not
conÔ¨Årmed that with an increasing concentration of a plasticiser the value of strain at which
the deformation occurs decreased, because the lowest value of strain at which the specimen
cracked was observed in the specimens made of PLA/PHB 5TAC (Figure 6).

3.5.3. Hank‚Äôs Solution
As for the specimens that did not contain a plasticiser, the porous specimens were
more resistant. The highest value of strain at which a porous specimen broke was observed
for the specimen made of PLA/PHB 0TA, i.e., without a plasticiser; all the remaining
porous specimens containing a plasticiser exhibited deformation at earlier times. As for the
specimens containing a plasticiser, the porous specimens were deformed earlier than the
solid ones. With the use of this particular solution, the PLA/PHB 5TAC material exhibited
deformation earlier than the specimens made of PLA/PHB 10TA. Therefore, unlike with
SS, with HS it was not conÔ¨Årmed that with an increasing concentration of a plasticiser the
strain at which the specimen was deformed decreased, because the lowest strain value at
which the deformation occurred was observed for the specimens made of PLA/PHB 5TAC
(Figure 6).Polymers 2021 ,13, 1542 13 of 17
4. Discussion
In the present case study, it is rather problematic to discuss the results obtained with
other authors, because there are only a few scientists who have examined biodegradation
of the identical mixtures of materials by applying the same method. The PLA material is
comprehensively studied as it is widely used as a green polymer in many areas [ 12]. Several
studies have dealt with biodegradation of the individual components separately while
concentrating mainly on the strength properties of these polymers. In 1995, relevant testing
was performed by Lianlai Zhang et al., who examined the mixability of different polymer
blends, including the PLA/PHB mixture, and their properties, which were impaired
by hydrolytic degradation. The study conÔ¨Årmed that this material might be used in
future medical applications thanks to its biodegradation properties [ 13]. This conclusion
correlates with the obtained results which conÔ¨Årmed that this material decomposes in
a water environment. Freier et al. also examined biodegradation in vitro in a buffer
solution and in a solution containing pancreatin extracted from rats [ 14]. In standard
conditions ( 37C;pH 7.4), the molecular mass of pure PHB decreased by one half, and
in the PLA by one third. The authors also observed slower degradation following the
addition of hydrophobic plasticisers triethyl citrate (TEC) and butyryl trihexyl citrate
(BTHC). The experiment revealed that the greatest weight loss was observed particularly
for the mixture with the highest TAC content; therefore, we can state that some plasticisers
may signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the speed of biodegradation. Also, the accelerating effect of
pancreatin on PHB degradation was conÔ¨Årmed as the degradation speed exhibited a
three-fold increase. Based on the study results, it is possible to state that despite the
initial resistance of the PHB material to low pH for a sufÔ¨Åciently long period of time, it is
eventually capable of complete decomposition in an organism.
Several studies have dealt with the preparation of scaffolds from the composite
materials containing PHB and ceramics while examining their biodegradation in simulated
body Ô¨Çuids. Wang et al. created the hydroxyapatite (HA) material, which was mixed
with poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate)
(PHBHHx) and a plasticiser, and the scaffolds made this material were monitored for
50 days while being immersed in simulated body Ô¨Çuid (SBF) solution. They measured
the weight loss and morphological changes in the materials; after 50 days of degradation
in vitro , PHB exhibited almost no changes and PHBHHx lost 7% of its weight [ 15]. A
similar study was also performed by Ni and Wang; they monitored a PHB/HA mixture
and evaluated its biodegradation by applying scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) [16]. The scaffolds produced were immersed in SBF
solution and monitored at 37C for 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months and 4 months. The SEM
revealed that mineral crystals grew on all HA/PHB composite specimens after 1 day of
being immersed in SBF; after 7 days, the mineral layer grew more intensively and the
surface of the mineral layer was signiÔ¨Åcantly smoother. The morphology of the mineral
layer, which was formed after the immersion in SBF for 2, 4 and 8 weeks, was similar to
the morphology of the mineral layer formed after the immersion in SBF for 7 days. A
dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) revealed that the storage module (E‚Äô) of the HA/PHB
composite was initially increasing over time while it was immersed in SBF, as a result of
the formation of apatite on the surface of the composite, but it decreased after a prolonged
immersion in SBF; this indicated the degradation of the composite.
Three-dimensional printing was applied by Barbeck et al. in order to produce scaffolds
made of pure PLA, PLA/G5 bioglass with a plasticiser, and polyethylene glycol (PEG).
The specimens were immersed in SBF at 37C for 8 weeks, and their weight loss and
mechanical properties were monitored [ 17]. A response of the connective tissues to the
presence of a scaffold was also monitored. Its mechanical properties impaired over time
during the degradation. The same Ô¨Ånding was also conÔ¨Årmed in our study. Mechanical
compressive properties were better in the scaffolds made of PLA/G5 than in those made of
pure PLA.Polymers 2021 ,13, 1542 14 of 17
Biodegradation of a combination of PLA and silica glass was also investigated by El-
Kady et al. They monitored the biological activity of scaffolds immersed in SBF at a constant
temperature and a constant pH while the specimens were incubated for 30 days [18] . They
monitored the weight loss, absorption of water, and changes in pH. A HA layer formed on
the surface of the scaffolds; it was scanned using the scanning electron microscope SEM
and subjected to an energy-dispersive X-ray analysis.
Vergnol et al. monitored the biodegradation of a combination of poly(L, DL)lactide
(P (L, DL) LA) and particles of bioglass 45S5. Similar to our study, they measured the
absorption of PBS on the basis of the weight loss; the microscopic properties were measured
by tomography; and mechanical properties were tested by compressive testing [ 19]. The
authors observed that after 6 months of degradation, the specimens lost 35% of their
original weight, and the tomography revealed the presence of cracks in these materials.
The conclusion was that the mechanical properties of such specimens were worse than
those of the reference specimens.
Scaffolds containing PLA and PHB have a promising potential for the applications
with animal cells; that is why these biomaterials are currently subjected to the extensive
research in their biodegradability potential. A paper by Li et al. described the testing of
various PHB copolymers by applying the method of accelerated degradation in SBF at 37C.
It was observed that poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) maleate copolymer
lost 21.4% of its original weight after being immersed in solution for 21 weeks [ 20]. In the
study by Boskhomdzhiev et al., they monitored the rate of in vitro biodegradation of PHB
in the presence of lipase as well as in vivo degradation after being implanted in an animal
tissue. They conÔ¨Årmed that the biodegradation of PHB includes a polymeric hydrolysis as
well as enzymatic degradation [21].
Guo et al. investigated a possibility of characterising the biologically degradable
porous scaffolds made of PLA which were intended to be used in tissue bioengineering;
the investigation was carried out by applying the selective enzymatic degradation. The
porous morphology and the properties of such scaffolds were examined in order to identify
whether the microstructure of the biomimetic extracellular matrix is suitable for the cell
proliferation and differentiation. PLA scaffolds degraded into harmless products in the
SBF solution at a low rate of degradation. The weight loss after 8 months of the in vitro
degradation represented 80%. It was also observed that PLA scaffolds supported the
cellular interconnection and growth. These Ô¨Åndings conÔ¨Årmed that the selective enzymatic
degradation may be applied in the production of scaffolds [22].
Biomaterials made of PLA and PHB are often subjected to experiments aimed at
discovering potential applications in food packaging and their subsequent biodegradation
in the composting conditions. Biodegradation and physical evaluation of the packaging
materials made of PHB were also discussed in the paper by Bucci et al. The properties of
such packaging materials were assessed by physical tests and compared to polypropylene
(PP). The results showed that these packaging materials acted as an effective barrier against
light and humidity. Biological degradation began after 60 days in compost, where the
packaging materials almost completely decomposed [23].
Savenkova et al. investigated the effects of plasticisers on the physical and biodegra-
dation properties of PHB-based Ô¨Ålms. They applied accelerated degradation testing (ADT)
at a temperature of 25C in the microbially active soil layers while the specimens were
left in the soil for 30 days. Several bacteria species were able to degrade this material,
and the resultant Ô¨Ånding was that as the concentration of plasticisers increased, the rate
of biodegradation proportionally decreased. Even though the biodegradation which was
performed in the study by Savenkova et al. was carried out in compost, it is possible that
the presence of plasticisers had a negative effect on the bacteria contained therein [24].
A similar idea was experimentally investigated by Wisuda Pattanasuttichonlakul et al.
In their paper, they described the examination of biodegradation using ultraviolet C (UV-C)
light and the subsequent placement of specimens in the soil containing microbiologicalPolymers 2021 ,13, 1542 15 of 17
organisms collected from the waste water sledge. They observed that PLA exhibited good
degradation properties as it completely decomposed in the soil [25].
A PLA/PHB mixture was investigated by DvoÀá r √°Àá ckov√°et al. for biodegradability in
a water environment using the sledge from a waste water treatment plant, in particular
the mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic sledge. The study conÔ¨Årmed that PLA did
not decompose in the mesophilic conditions, whereas in a thermophilic environment
it degraded in more than 80%. After 60 days of abiotic hydrolysis of the PLA/PHB
mixture, degradation represented 23.8%. This has proved that hydrolytic enzymes affect
a biodegradation degree [ 26]. All the aforementioned authors achieved similar results,
which indicate that PLA/PHB-based materials may be used in the development of various
medical devices or food packaging materials due to their biodegradation properties. In
further experimental research, the authors of this paper will perform chemical analyses of
this material after degradation and degradation products in solution.
5. Conclusions
In our experiment, we found out that the examined material gradually degraded in the
in vitro conditions; this biomaterial is, therefore, suitable for further investigation. The most
suitable specimen was a solid specimen with a 5% content of a plasticiser, and it exhibited
the average absorption value of 1.443 0.001% after 195 days of being immersed in HS. As
for the porous specimens, the lowest value of absorption ( 2.0590.001%) was observed in
the experiment with the PLA/PHB 5TAC material immersed in PBS solution. On the basis
of the performed tests it is possible to conclude that the difference between the absorption
values was affected by the differences in the compositions of the biodegradation media. A
statistical analysis revealed that a specimen shape, type of a degradation medium, and a
plasticiser content affected the changes in the specimen weight and consequently also the
changes in absorption. The evaluation of morphological changes in the specimens revealed
the formation of block cracks in the specimens containing a TAC plasticiser. Mechanical
compression testing of the specimens resulted in the Ô¨Ånding that deformation of the
plasticiser-free specimens began at the latest time. This means that they are mechanically
more resistant to compression than the specimens containing a plasticiser.
The Ô¨Ånal result of the experiment was the Ô¨Ånding that even though the specimens
without a plasticiser exhibited higher values of absorption of a respective solution, they
were not present with any block cracks or bubbles. Also, the pH values of the solutions in
which they were immersed were neutral for the entire duration of the experiment.
