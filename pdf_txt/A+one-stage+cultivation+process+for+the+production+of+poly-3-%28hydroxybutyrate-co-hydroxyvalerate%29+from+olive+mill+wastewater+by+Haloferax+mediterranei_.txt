Abstract: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is an emerging biodegradable plastic family that can re-
place a broad spectrum of conventional thermoplastics and is promising in the sustainable process
development and valorization of organic waste. This study established a novel production system of
PHA from food waste through halophilic microbial fermentation with spent medium recycling. The
essential processing parameters for batch cultivation of Haloferax mediterranei were optimized for food
waste substrate (a 40 g/L loading and 2.5 vvm of aeration), which achieved a yield of 0.3 g PHA/g
COD consumed. A batch bioreactor system was developed, which produced 7.0 0.7 g/L cell dry
mass and 4.5 0.2 g/L PHA with a 20% dissolved oxygen (DO) level. A DO above 50% saturation
resulted in faster cell growth and similar cell mass production but 25% less PHA production. The
spent saline medium, treated with H 2O2and rotary evaporation, was successfully reused for four
consecutive batches and provided consistent PHA concentrations and product qualities.

1. Introduction
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is a family of high-value polyesters with properties
similar to thermoplastics and is one major material used for manufacturing biodegradable
plastics [ 1]. PHA is commercially available for various applications, including packaging,
medical materials, nutritional supplements, and biofuels [ 2]. The high production cost is
a major barrier to market expansion [ 3]. There is a study that found that feedstock cost
contributes over 40% of the total annual production cost [ 4]. Food waste is a potential
low-cost feedstock because of rich nutrients which provide essential carbon, nitrogen,
and phosphorous sources for microbial cultivation and PHA production [ 5]. The com-
plex organics of municipal food waste often require pretreatment approaches to generate
precursors for PHA synthesis [ 3]. Acidogenic fermentation has been widely applied to
commercial anaerobic digesters to process food waste. After fermentation, most studies
endorsed mixed microbial consortium (MMC) to produce PHA [ 6–9]. Studies on utilizing
pure culture PHA production from fermented food waste have been scarce. An extreme
halophilic archaeon, Haloferax mediterranei , can metabolize various types of waste feed-
stocks [ 5,10,11] and requires a high saline environment (19% total salts) which minimizes
the risk of contamination and facilitates an extraction process through osmotic shock [ 12], it
is, therefore, a promising candidate. The PHA produced by H. mediterranei is characterized
as poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), which is a high-value PHA and
has various applications.
The critical parameters involved in PHA production, including feedstock type, sub-
strate loading, and aeration rate, have not been fully understood for this halophilic mi-
croorganism. The nutrients derived from food waste can vary even in the same anaerobic
digester. High substrate loadings with high concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) may
also inhibit cell growth [ 13]. Another study reported that the substrate loadings of seaweed
Bioengineering 2022 ,9, 630. https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering9110630 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/bioengineeringBioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 2 of 16
hydrolysate signiﬁcantly impacted cell mass and PHA production by H. mediterranei [14].
The saturated dissolved oxygen (DO) in a medium with 19% total salts is 2.50 mg/L at
37C, which is only 37% of the saturated DO (6.73 mg/L) in freshwater [ 15]. Therefore, the
aeration rate can be critical to H. mediterranei . There are no universal guidelines for DO level
in culturing this halophile in the literature. Some studies used shaking ﬂasks in the ambient
atmosphere [ 16,17]. Some used various-sized bioreactors with forced aeration: a 100% DO
saturation during the entire culturing period [ 18]; a 50% DO saturation was maintained
during balanced cell growth, and the DO dropped to 30% for PHA formation process [ 19];
others maintained a 20% saturated DO [ 17,20,21]. Therefore, this study intended to deter-
mine the optimum levels of these key processing parameters in halophilic PHBV production
from fermented food waste and understand the variance between production scales.
Previous studies on H. mediterranei mostly did not consider the treatment of spent salts
after production. Salts are the principle water pollutants in freshwater bodies [ 22], and
wastewater with chloride ions exceeding 1500 mg/L cannot be discharged [ 23]. Therefore,
treating spent brine in large-scale productions would be economically critical. One study
proposed a method of using a hot decanoic acid solution to precipitate salts from the
spent stillage medium [ 24]. However, it requires a long processing time which adds to the
operating cost. Another study reported that direct reuse of the spent supernatant resulted in
a 68% lower ﬁnal PHA production than the original batch [ 20]. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop an efﬁcient technique to recycle the spent salts with high productivity and
low processing cost.
Another hotspot that has not been well studied is the impact of the leftover nutrients
that accumulate after multiple recycled batches on cell growth and production yield. These
compounds include residual sugars, short-chain carboxylates, micronutrients that are not
fully consumed by H. mediterranei , and cell metabolites generated during cell growth, such
as acetic acid and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). Those leftover nutrients can con-
tribute substantially to organics after multiple batch runs, which may inﬂuence cell growth
and PHBV production. Chemical oxidation by H 2O2,which is widely used in industrial
wastewater treatment [ 25,26], can be effective in removing excessive chemical oxygen
demand (COD) from the spent saline medium. H 2O2is also known as the oxygen supplier
to microorganisms in biological treatment facilities due to its natural decomposition into
oxygen and water [26].
Therefore, this study proposed to develop a novel and sustainable bioconversion
system of halophilic PHA production integrating the utilization of municipal food waste,
with three main objectives: (1) to determine the optimum processing parameters that
provide the highest PHA production from food waste; (2) to design and develop a robust
integrated bioreactor system; and (3) to develop an efﬁcient and applicable technique to
process and recycle the spent salts while maintaining consistent production and product
qualities.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Feedstock Collection and Pretreatment
The feedstock was collected from the Renewable Energy Anaerobic Digester (READ)
(Davis, CA, USA), which processes municipal food waste from local grocery stores and
dining commons. READ employs a two-stage high-solid anaerobic fermentation/digestion
technology consisting of a fermentation process to decompose food waste into short-chain
carboxylic acids, including lactic acid (La), acetic acid (Ac), propionic acid (Pr), butyric acid
(Bu) and other volatile fatty acids (VFA), soluble nitrogen, phosphorous, and micronutrients;
and a digestion process where those nutrients from the previous stage are further converted
into biogas [ 27]. The feedstock used in this study was the fermented food waste collected
from the ﬁrst stage. Prior to collection, the feedstock samples were treated by an onsite
screw press to pass through a 1-mm screen; as a result, a thin slurry was recovered after the
removal of most of the large particles.Bioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 3 of 16
Two feedstock samples with a volume of 45 L each were collected at two different
times of the year. The samples were transported immediately after collection and stored
in a 10C freezer until further use. The feedstock samples were processed through a
bench-scale crossﬂow microﬁltration unit (Sterlitech, Auburn, WA, USA) with a 0.22 m
ﬂat-sheet membrane (Synder, Vacaville, CA, USA) to further remove suspended solids. The
temperature was maintained at around 4C by a refrigeration unit and ice bath during
the ﬁltration process to minimize the loss of volatile solids. An outﬂow stream free of
suspended particles, also known as the fermented food waste permeates (FWP), was used
as the sole substrate for the following PHA production experiments, without any other
carbon or nitrogen sources for cell cultivation. The processes of feedstock collection and
pretreatment are shown in Figure 1.

was recovered after the removal of most of the large particles. 
Two feedstock samples with a volume of 45  L each were collected at two different 
times of the year. The samples were transpor ted immediately after collection and stored 
in a −10 °C freezer until further use. The feedstock samples were processed through a 
bench-scale crossflow microfiltration unit (Sterlitech, Auburn, WA, USA) with a 0.22 μm 
flat-sheet membrane (Synder, Vacaville, CA, USA) to further remove suspended solids. 
The temperature was maintained at around 4 °C by a refrigeration unit and ice bath dur-ing the filtration process to minimize the loss of volatile solids. An outflow stream free of 
suspended particles, also known as the ferm ented food waste permeates (FWP), was used 
as the sole substrate for the following PHA production experiments, without any other 
carbon or nitrogen sources for cell cultivation. The processes of feedstock collection and 
pretreatment are shown in Figure 1.

2.2. Microorganism and Culture Conditions 
The wild-type halophilic archaeon, H. mediterranei  (ATCC 33500, Manassas, VA, 
USA), was used as the microbial PHA producer. The strain was firstly grown in the stand-
ard seed medium (containing NaCl, 156 g/L; MgCl 26H 2O, 13 g/L; MgSO 4, 9.8 g/L; 
CaCl 26H 2O, 1 g/L; KCl, 4 g/L; NaBr, 0.5 g/L, yeast extract, 5 g/L, glucos e, 10 g/L, and Na-
HCO 3, 2.1 g/L) at 37 °C until the late exponential phase. The cell culture was centrifuged 
at 2940× g for 5 min and resuspended in the minimum salt medium (MSM) (containing 
NaCl, 156 g/L; MgCl 26H 2O, 13 g/L; MgSO 4, 9.8 g/L; CaCl 26H 2O, 1 g/L; KCl, 4 g/L; NaBr, 
0.5 g/L and FeCl 3, 5 mg/L with 10 mL/L trace meta l solution SL-6, containing ZnSO 47H 2O, 
100 mg/L; MnCl 24H 2O, 30 mg/L; H 3BO 3, 300 mg/L; CoCl 26H 2O, 200 mg/L; CuCl 22H 2O, 
10 mg/L; NiCl 26H 20, 20 mg/L; Na 2MoO 4H2O, 30 mg/L) [11,28]. The cell suspension was 
used as the inoculum for all experiments. Al l the chemicals were purchased from Thermo 
Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). 
The two FWP feedstock samples, named FWP 1 and FWP 2, were used as the sole 
substrate to cultivate H. mediterranei . Two sets of two-factor factorial experiments were 
conducted: (1) three levels of aeration rate (in air volume per working volume per minute, 
vvm): 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and two levels of FWP 1 loading (in g/L COD): 40, 80; (2) two types of 
substrate: FWP 1, FWP 2 and four levels of substrate loading (in g/L COD): 20, 40, 60, 80. 
The experiments were conducted using 250-mL  glass bioreactors with 80% working vol-
ume. The bioreactors were housed in an incubator with a temperature of 37 ± 0.5 °C. 
Forced aeration was applied to all reactors using air pumps, and the aeration rate was 
adjusted using air flowmeters. The air was pre-humidified by water to leverage volume

2.2. Microorganism and Culture Conditions
The wild-type halophilic archaeon, H. mediterranei (ATCC 33500, Manassas, VA, USA),
was used as the microbial PHA producer. The strain was ﬁrstly grown in the standard seed
medium (containing NaCl, 156 g/L; MgCl 26H2O, 13 g/L; MgSO 4, 9.8 g/L; CaCl 26H2O,
1 g/L; KCl, 4 g/L; NaBr, 0.5 g/L, yeast extract, 5 g/L, glucose, 10 g/L, and NaHCO 3,
2.1 g/L) at 37C until the late exponential phase. The cell culture was centrifuged at
2940gfor 5 min and resuspended in the minimum salt medium (MSM) (containing NaCl,
156 g/L; MgCl 26H2O, 13 g/L; MgSO 4, 9.8 g/L; CaCl 26H2O, 1 g/L; KCl, 4 g/L; NaBr,
0.5 g/L and FeCl 3,5 mg/L with 10 mL/L trace metal solution SL-6, containing ZnSO 47H2O,
100 mg/L; MnCl 24H2O, 30 mg/L; H 3BO3, 300 mg/L; CoCl 26H2O, 200 mg/L; CuCl 22H2O,
10 mg/L; NiCl 26H20, 20 mg/L; Na 2MoO 4H2O, 30 mg/L) [ 11,28]. The cell suspension was
used as the inoculum for all experiments. All the chemicals were purchased from Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc (Waltham, MA, USA).
The two FWP feedstock samples, named FWP 1 and FWP 2, were used as the sole
substrate to cultivate H. mediterranei . Two sets of two-factor factorial experiments were
conducted: (1) three levels of aeration rate (in air volume per working volume per minute,
vvm): 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and two levels of FWP 1 loading (in g/L COD): 40, 80; (2) two types
of substrate: FWP 1, FWP 2 and four levels of substrate loading (in g/L COD): 20, 40, 60,
80. The experiments were conducted using 250-mL glass bioreactors with 80% working
volume. The bioreactors were housed in an incubator with a temperature of 37 0.5C.
Forced aeration was applied to all reactors using air pumps, and the aeration rate was
adjusted using air ﬂowmeters. The air was pre-humidiﬁed by water to leverage volume loss
by forced aeration [ 5]. MSM was added to create a salinity at 188 2 parts per thousand
(ppt). The same inoculation was applied for all reactors to give an initial optical density
(OD) of 1.0 0.2 at 520 nm wavelength. The buffer solution (50 mM NaHCO 3) was addedBioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 4 of 16
at the beginning of the experiments. The pH was maintained at 7 0.2 throughout the
cell cultivation through adjustment by either 3 M NaOH solution or 3 M HCl solution.
The dissolved oxygen (DO) levels of cell broth were monitored daily by a DO meter (YSI
ProDSS, Rye Brook, New York, NY, USA). The cells were cultured for 120 to 216 h until cell
growth reached the stationary phase.
2.3. Batch Production System with Two Aeration Strategies
A bench-top bioreactor system was developed for PHA production from FWP (shown
in Figure 2). The system consists of a 6-L feeder tank with overhead mixer; a peristaltic ﬂow
pump with ﬂowrate controller (Grainger, Bakersﬁeld, CA, USA); a 6-L aerated reactor with
a controlled air sparging at the bottom (by compressed air outlet, a humidiﬁer to moisten
the air, and an inline air ﬂowmeter) and temperature control (using a water jacket and
insolation); a circulating water bath (equipped with internal pumping and heating-cooling
components) (Drainwell, Shanghai, China); a peristaltic pump with controlled ﬂowrate for
inoculation (Grainger, Bakersﬁeld, CA, USA); a 6-L harvest tank; an external centrifuge
(Heraeus Multifuge X1R, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) for solid/liquid
separation; a PHA extraction/puriﬁcation block including consistent temperature control
and rotation; and built-in data logging units of temperature, pH, and DO. All bioreactors
were made of plastic materials to prevent high salinity corrosion.

loss by forced aeration [5]. MSM was added to create a salinity at 188 ± 2 parts per thou-
sand (ppt). The same inoculation was applied for all reactors to give an initial optical den-
sity (OD) of 1.0 ± 0.2 at 520 nm wavelength. The buffer solution (50 mM NaHCO 3) was 
added at the beginning of the experiments. The pH was maintained at 7 ± 0.2 throughout 
the cell cultivation through adjustment by either 3M NaOH solution or 3M HCl solution.

2.3. Batch Production System with Two Aeration Strategies 
A bench-top bioreactor system was de veloped for PHA production from FWP 
(shown in Figure 2). The system consists of a 6-L feeder tank with overhead mixer; a per-istaltic flow pump with flowrate controller (Grainger, Bakersfield, CA, USA); a 6-L aerated 
reactor with a controlled air sparging at the bottom (by compressed air outlet, a humidifier 
to moisten the air, and an inline air flowmeter) and temperature control (using a water 
jacket and insolation); a circulating water bath (equipped with internal pumping and heat-
ing-cooling components) (Drainwell, Shanghai, China); a peristaltic pump with controlled flowrate for inoculation (Grainger, Bakersfiel d, CA, USA); a 6-L harvest tank; an external 
centrifuge (Heraeus Multifuge X1R, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 
solid/liquid separation; a PHA extraction/purification block including consistent temper-
ature control and rotation; and built-in data logging units of temperature, pH, and DO.

Batch production experiments were conducted endorsing the optimum cell culture
conditions, including substrate type, substrate loading, and aeration rate, which were
determined from previous experiments. The working volume was 5 L. Other culturingBioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 5 of 16
conditions were the same as those described in previous sessions. Four production batches
were operated with different aeration strategies where (1) the aeration rate was controlled at
2.5 vvm in the ﬁrst two batches and (2) the DO level of cell broth was controlled above 50%
of the saturation level in the last two batches with variable aeration rates of 2.5 to 8 vvm.
The cell growth, PHA production, substrate consumption, DO level, pH, and temperature
were monitored daily during the batch period. The cells were cultured for 132 h until cell
growth reached the stationary phase. Duplicates were prepared for each of the variable
conditions.
2.4. Spent Saline Medium Treatment and Recycling
The FWP 1 was used as the substrate to provide a soluble COD of 20 g/L. The 250-mL
bioreactors with a working volume of 200 mL were used for cell cultivation experiments.
The cell culturing conditions were the same as described previously in Session 2.2. A total of
four consecutive batch runs were conducted, with the spent salts being recycled and reused
for cell cultivation. At the end of each batch run, the cells were separated from the spent
medium through centrifugation at 2940 gfor 30 min. The spent saline medium (SSM)
from the second batch was treated with H 2O2by adding an aqueous solution containing
30% H 2O2at 5% of the total volume and reacting for 8 h. After treatment, the SSM was
processed by a rotary evaporator (Büchi R-3, Switzerland). The evaporation was conducted
with an applied vacuum and a temperature of 57C for 30 min. The evaporation treatment
was stopped when salt crystals started appearing in the brine. The remaining brine solution
was then used for cell cultivation in the following batch runs with two mass levels: 80%
and 90% of the total spent salt mass being recycled. The same conditions of nutrients and
cell cultivation were provided to all batch runs.
2.5. Analytical Methods
2.5.1. Feedstock Characterization
Before and after the microﬁltration process, 10 mL of homogeneous samples were
collected from the inﬂow, permeate, and retentate streams and characterized for the compo-
sition of the major nutrients. The concentrations of short-chain carboxylic acids, including
La and VFAs, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agi-
lent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following an analytical method described by [ 29]. COD, total
nitrogen, and reactive phosphorous contents were measured by standard chemical kits
(HACH, Loveland, CO, USA). The trace elements and micronutrients, including K, Ca, Mg,
Na, B, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, and Ni, were measured by UC Davis Analytical Lab using a nitric
acid/hydrogen peroxide microwave digestion method.
2.5.2. Cell Biomass Measurement
Cell growth was monitored by collecting 2 mL of strain broth, and its OD was mea-
sured by a spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) at a wave-
length of 520 nm [ 18]. The cell dry mass (CDM) was determined as the volatile suspended
solids (VSS) of the cell broth: 10 mL of cell broth was sampled and subjected to centrifuga-
tion at 2940 gfor 20 min. The cell pellet was washed with MSM and measured following a
standard method [ 30]. As for the measurement of nutrients, the supernatant from the CDM
measurement was ﬁltered through a 0.22 m membrane. The ﬁltrate was measured for the
COD, total N, reactive P , and the contents of La and VFAs using the methods described in
the previous session.
2.5.3. Product Extraction and Quantiﬁcation
PHA was extracted and quantiﬁed following a method by [ 31] with modiﬁcations:
40 mL cell broth was collected at designated time points and treated by immediate cen-
trifugation at 2940 gfor 30 min. The cell pellet was washed twice with 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution and then deionized water. The washed pellet was ﬁrst
dissolved in 2 mL dichloromethane and 2 mL acidic methanol (3% v/vH2SO4), with 1 g/LBioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 6 of 16
benzoic acid as the internal standard. The liquid mixture was then heated in a digital
reactor block (HACH DRB200, Loveland, CO, USA) at 105C for 4 h and cooled to room
temperature. The solution was added with 1 mL of deionized water, mixed, and settled
until a phase separation was observed. The organic phase was then transferred to a clean
vial for quantiﬁcation. Poly (3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-3-hydroxyvaleric acid) with 12%
HV (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) was used as the standard PHA chemical. The
samples were analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
method described in a previous research article by [5].
2.6. Statistical Analysis
All the experiments were conducted in triplicates, and the results are presented as
meanstandard deviation (SD). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc
Tukey test was performed to provide the signiﬁcance of the difference between mean values
for comparison. The signiﬁcance level ( ) was 0.05 throughout the study. The software
Origin Pro (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) was used for all data analysis in this study.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of Microﬁltration Streams
The fermented food waste feedstock collected from READ was pre-treated by a mi-
croﬁltration process to obtain a particle-free FWP . The FWP accounted for 73 3% ( v/v)
of the initial feedstock inﬂow and was used as the substrate for cell cultivation and PHA
production by H. mediterranei . The rest of the inﬂow came out as the retentate containing
the suspended solids, which the microbes cannot utilize. Instead, it could be used as seed
culture for anaerobic fermentation of food waste or recycled back to READ facilities for
further anaerobic digestion to generate biogas as a source of bioenergy.
Table 1 compares the nutrient composition of inﬂuent, permeate (FWP), and retentate
of the two fermented food waste feedstocks. The three streams of the same feedstock had
close contents of short-chain carboxylic acids. However, the concentrations of La, Ac, Pr,
and Bu in both permeate and retentate were slightly lower than those in the inﬂow stream.
This may be due to the loss of volatile organic compounds (VOC) during microﬁltration.
The loss can be reduced by increasing the ﬁltration ﬂux and shortening the processing
time. Among the three ﬁltration streams, inﬂow and retentate had higher COD, total N,
and reactive P concentrations than permeate because permeate contains only the soluble
nutrients of the inﬂow. The suspended solids of inﬂow were mainly food waste scraps with
a small portion of microbial biomass, which can be further fermented into soluble nutrients
and utilized for PHA production. Permeate 2 (FWP 2) had more La and Ac than permeate 1
(FWP 1), and FWP 1 had more Pr than FWP 2. The carboxylic acids accounted for 67% of the
total COD in FWP 1 and 92% of the total COD in FWP 2. The major species of short-chain
carboxylic acids were La, Ac, Pr, and Bu for both permeates, with different compositions (%
of total carboxylic acids): 41%, 17%, 33%, 7% in FWP 1; and 51%, 23%, 18%, and 6% in FWP
2. FWP 1 had higher total N and reactive P contents than FWP 2. Table 2 lists the results of
micronutrients and trace elements in the permeate samples, suggesting that FWP 1 and
FWP 2 had close contents of those compounds. Compared with the standard medium for
cell culture (MSM and SL-6), both permeate samples were able to provide enough nutrients
and trace elements of K, Ca, B, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, and Ni that are essential for cell growth.
With FWP 1 and FWP 2 as the sole substrate for cell culture, only additional Na and Mg
salts were needed to provide enough salinity.Bioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 7 of 16

3.2. Effect of Aeration Rate
Figure 3a demonstrates the cell mass and PHBV production with different levels of
aeration rate. The aeration rate signiﬁcantly affected PHBV production ( p-values was 0.003).
The interaction between the two parameters was not statistically signiﬁcant (the p-value was
0.4). With a COD loading of 40 g/L, the lowest aeration level of 0.5 vvm gave a much lower
CDM production (4.00 1.25 g/L VSS) than the higher aeration levels (6.45 0.34 g/L VSS
from 1.5 vvm, and 6.69 0.02 g/L VSS from 2.5 vvm). And the two higher aeration levels
resulted in close CDM production, as mentioned previously. Low substrate loading yielded
higher CDM for all aeration levels than high substrate loading. For instance, with an
aeration rate of 0.5 vvm, the CDM produced from 80 g/L COD loading was 3.33 0.28 g/L
VSS, which is much lower than the CDM of 4.00 1.25 g/L VSS produced from 40 g/L
COD. This may be due to the substrate inhibition that occurred with high concentrations
of VFAs in the medium [ 32]. The growth of H. mediterranei was found to decelerate with
increasing loadings of Ac, Pr, Bu, and Va [ 11]. The trend of PHBV formation corresponded
to cell growth because PHBV synthesis was a growth-associated reaction [ 5]. The highest
CDM and PHBV production was 6.70 0.02 g/L VSS and 4.30.1 g/L, respectively,
which were achieved with the highest aeration rate (2.5 vvm) and the lower substrate
loading (40 g/L COD).Bioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 8 of 16

g/L, respectively, which were achieved with the highest aeration rate (2.5 vvm) and the 
lower substrate loading (40 g/L COD).

PHBV; ( c) the HV content of PHBV polymers; ( d) the consumption of short-chain carboxylates with 
the low substrate loading (40 g/L COD); and ( e) with the high substrate loading (80 g/L COD). Note: 
Same letters indicated that the mean va lues were not significantly different ( p > 0.05). 
As illustrated in Figure 3b, the PHBV content of cell mass remained stable at 62% to 
64% among all different aeration rates, except for a statistically lower PHBV content from 
80g/L COD loading and 0.5 vvm of aeration. The HV contents of the polymer (shown in 
Figure 3c) were not statistically different am ong different aeration rates for 40 g/L COD 
loading. Figure 3d,e demonstrates the consum ption of short-chain carboxylates with dif-
ferent growth conditions. Among all carboxylate species, La, Pr, and Bu were the major ones consumed by H. mediterranei . With low substrate loading, there was more consump-
tion of carboxylates with increasing aeration from 0.5 to 1.5 vvm, and it remained con-
sistent between 1.5 and 2.5 vvm. For example, cells consumed 2.08 ± 0.36, 6.54 ± 0.39, and 
6.76 ± 0.05 g/L Pr with increasing aeration of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 vvm. The consumption of 
acetate was negative in some cases, as shown in Figure 3e, meaning the cells produced 
and accumulated more acetate than consumed . This phenomenon was also observed in 
sugar substrates which caused a pH drop below 6 during cell culturing [14]. These results 
suggest that an aeration rate of 0.5 to 1.5 vvm, which is normally used in the biotech in-dustry [33], was not sufficient for culturing H. mediterranei . A low saturated DO level in

Same letters indicated that the mean values were not signiﬁcantly different ( p> 0.05).
As illustrated in Figure 3b, the PHBV content of cell mass remained stable at 62% to
64% among all different aeration rates, except for a statistically lower PHBV content from
80 g/L COD loading and 0.5 vvm of aeration. The HV contents of the polymer (shown
in Figure 3c) were not statistically different among different aeration rates for 40 g/L
COD loading. Figure 3d,e demonstrates the consumption of short-chain carboxylates
with different growth conditions. Among all carboxylate species, La, Pr, and Bu were
the major ones consumed by H. mediterranei . With low substrate loading, there was more
consumption of carboxylates with increasing aeration from 0.5 to 1.5 vvm, and it remained
consistent between 1.5 and 2.5 vvm. For example, cells consumed 2.08 0.36, 6.54 0.39,
and 6.76 0.05 g/L Pr with increasing aeration of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 vvm. The consumption of
acetate was negative in some cases, as shown in Figure 3e, meaning the cells produced and
accumulated more acetate than consumed. This phenomenon was also observed in sugarBioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 9 of 16
substrates which caused a pH drop below 6 during cell culturing [ 14]. These results suggest
that an aeration rate of 0.5 to 1.5 vvm, which is normally used in the biotech industry [ 33],
was not sufﬁcient for culturing H. mediterranei . A low saturated DO level in high-saline
water also causes a low oxygen transfer rate [ 34]. Therefore, an aeration rate of 2.5 vvm is
recommended for a bioreactor study on this halophile.
3.3. Effects of Substrate Loading and Type
The effects of feedstock type and substrate loading were studied with a ﬁxed aeration
rate of 2.5 vvm. Figure 4a illustrates the concentrations of CDM and PHBV produced with
different substrate loadings and feedstock types. FWP 1 and FWP 2 had quite different
nutrient compositions of short-chain carboxylates, as described in Session 3.1. The substrate
type and loading had signiﬁcant effects on both CDM and PHBV productions ( p-values for
CDM were 1.76 10 6and 3.93 10 5, for PHBV , were 3.14 10 9and 1.76 10 6). The
interaction between the two factors was also signiﬁcant ( p-value for CDM was 0.0012 and
for PHBV was 5.66 10 6). Among all substrate loadings, the CDM produced from FWP 1
was up to 2 times more than FWP 2. For example, with a 40 g/L COD loading, the CDM
was 6.76 0.08 g/L VSS from FWP 1, and it was 2.67 0.86 g/L VSS from FWP 2. The
PHBV yielded from FWP 1 was also much higher than FWP 2: with 40 g/L COD loading,
the PHBV was 4.01 0.05 g/L from FWP 1, and it was 0.67 0.21 g/L from FWP 2. This
may be because total carboxylates accounted for a higher portion of COD in FWP 2 than in
FWP 1, which led to higher loadings of some carboxylic species from FWP 2 than in FWP 1
with a ﬁxed COD loading. Some VFA species with high concentrations can be inhibitory to
the cell growth of H. mediterranei [11]. Another reason can be the higher contents of other
nutrients, including N, P , and the rest of COD besides carboxylates, which may boost cell
growth and PHBV synthesis.
A general trend was observed that the CDM and PHBV production ﬁrst increased
and later decreased with higher substrate loadings, possibly due to substrate inhibition.
The highest production also differed depending on feedstock types. For FWP 1, the
highest CDM and PHBV production was 6.80 0.08 and 4.00 0.05 g/L, respectively,
which were obtained from a substrate loading of 40 g/L COD. The yield from 40 g/L
COD was 0.30.0 g PHBV/g COD. For FWP 2, the highest CDM and PHBV production
were 4.40.4and 2.3 0.1 g/L, respectively, which were from a substrate loading of
60 g/L COD.
Figure 4b,c demonstrates the PHBV content of cells and HV content of PHBV produced
from different feedstocks with four substrate loadings. When FWP 1 was used, the loading
levels did not inﬂuence the HV content and PHBV content with 40 to 80 g/L COD loadings.
However, the substrate loading levels resulted in signiﬁcantly different PHBV contents
(p-value was 5.36 10 6) and HV contents ( p-value was 3.45 10 4) when FWP 2 was
used. FWP 1 resulted in higher cell contents of PHBV and HV content among all substrate
loadings than FWP 2. For instance, with 40 g/L COD loading, the cell content of PHBV and
HV content was 59.2 0.1% and 16.5 0.0% obtained from FWP 1, which were higher than
25.20.2 and 13.0 1.0% from FWP 2. A high cell content of PHBV suggests a high mass
portion of CDM accounted for PHBV , indicating a better efﬁciency of PHBV synthesis. For
FWP 1, the cell contents of PHBV were stable within 55% to 60% with all substrate loadings;
however, for FWP 2, the cell contents of PHBV were within a wider range (5% to 50%). A
high HV content of PHBV polymer suggests a high mass ratio of HV monomer versus HB
monomer, which would beneﬁt the ﬂexibility and elasticity of bioplastic material. The HV
contents derived from FWP 1 were at 16% to 18% of PHBV , and the HV contents derived
from FWP 2 were below 16% of PHBV with all substrate loadings.Bioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 10 of 16

high-saline water also causes a low oxygen tran sfer rate [34]. Therefore, an aeration rate 
of 2.5 vvm is recommended for a bior eactor study on this halophile.  
3.3. Effects of Substrate Loading and Type 
The effects of feedstock type and substrate loading were studied with a fixed aeration 
rate of 2.5 vvm. Figure 4a illustrates the co ncentrations of CDM and PHBV produced with 
different substrate loadings and feedstock types. FWP 1 and FWP 2 had quite different 
nutrient compositions of short-chain carboxylates, as described in Session 3.1. The sub-
strate type and loading had significant effects on both CDM and PHBV productions ( p-
values for CDM were 1.76 × 10−6 and 3.93 × 10−5, for PHBV, were 3.14 × 10−9 and 1.76 × 10−6). 
The interaction between the two factors was also significant ( p-value for CDM was 0.0012 
and for PHBV was 5.66 × 10−6). Among all substrate loadings, the CDM produced from 
FWP 1 was up to 2 times more than FWP 2. For example, with a 40 g/L COD loading, the 
CDM was 6.76 ± 0.08 g/L VSS from FWP 1, and it was 2.67 ± 0.86 g/L VSS from FWP 2. The 
PHBV yielded from FWP 1 was also much higher than FWP 2: with 40 g/L COD loading, 
the PHBV was 4.01 ± 0.05 g/L from FWP 1, and it was 0.67 ± 0.21 g/L from FWP 2. This 
may be because total carboxylates accounted for a higher portion of COD in FWP 2 than 
in FWP 1, which led to higher loadings of some carboxylic species from FWP 2 than in 
FWP 1 with a fixed COD loading. Some VFA species with high concentrations can be in-
hibitory to the cell growth of H. mediterranei  [11]. Another reason can be the higher con-
tents of other nutrients, including N, P, an d the rest of COD besides carboxylates, which 
may boost cell growth and PHBV synthesis.

Figure 4. Effects of feedstock type and substrate loading on ( a) CDM and PHBV production; ( b) cell
content of PHBV; ( c) the HV content of PHBV; ( d) the consumption of short-chain carboxylates with
FWP 1 as feedstock; and ( e) FWP 2 as feedstock. Note: Same letters indicated that the mean values
were not signiﬁcantly different ( p> 0.05).
The consumption of carboxylates is demonstrated in Figure 4d,e. Compared to FWP
2, there was more Pr consumed in FWP 1. For instance, with 40 g/L COD loading, cells
consumed 6.87 0.05 g/L Pr from FWP 1, and only 1.90 0.42 g/L Pr was consumed from
FWP 2 with the same substrate loading. Since Pr is the direct precursor to synthesize HV
units of the PHBV , it can explain why the HV content from FWP 1 was higher than FWP 2.
The HV content from FWP 1 was 16.5 0.0%, while it was 13.0 1.0% from FWP 2 with
the same 40 g/L COD loading. These results suggest FWP 1 was a better candidate than
FWP 2 because of higher CDM and PHBV production, cell content of PHBV , and higher
HV content of PHBV polymers. A substrate loading of 40 g/L COD was selected among all
other loadings for its higher production yields of CDM and PHBV .
3.4. Batch Production in Integrated Bioreactor System
As shown in Figure 5a, the DO of cell broth with a stable aeration rate of 2.5 vvm
dropped abruptly from over 80% sat. to less than 20% sat. at the exponential growth phase
when the cells were rapidly propagating (36 to 84 h). The DO increased back to over 60%Bioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 11 of 16
sat. when the cells were approaching the stationary phase (108 h). With a different aeration
strategy where the aeration rate was adjusted according to the DO level (Figure 5b), the
DO of cell broth was maintained at over 50% sat. during the entire cultivation period.

The curves of cell growth and PHBV synthesis are shown in Figure 5c,d, which cor-
respond to the two different aeration strategies. With a controlled aeration rate of 2.5 vvm, the concentration of CDM reached 7.0 ± 0.7 g/L VSS within 120 h and remained stable 
afterward. The PHBV concentration increased to 4.8 ± 0.6 g/L within the same culturing 
time. The two curves are approximately parallel  to each other throughout the entire pro-
duction, which aligns well with a previous finding that the PHBV synthesis from food 
waste-derived nutrients is a growth-associated reaction by H. mediterranei  [5]. With a con-
trolled DO level above 50% sat., the cells grew much faster and reached the stationary 
growth phase within 72 h, which shortened the cultivation period by 2 days. The final 
CDM (7.2 ± 0.9 g/L VSS) was close to the one with a controlled aeration rate, indicating 
that the second aeration strategy increased the productivity of CDM. However, the final 
PHBV was 2.8 ± 0.6 g/L, much lower than the one with a controlled aeration rate at 2.5

The curves of cell growth and PHBV synthesis are shown in Figure 5c,d, which
correspond to the two different aeration strategies. With a controlled aeration rate of
2.5 vvm, the concentration of CDM reached 7.0 0.7 g/L VSS within 120 h and remained
stable afterward. The PHBV concentration increased to 4.8 0.6 g/L within the same
culturing time. The two curves are approximately parallel to each other throughout the
entire production, which aligns well with a previous ﬁnding that the PHBV synthesis from
food waste-derived nutrients is a growth-associated reaction by H. mediterranei [5]. With a
controlled DO level above 50% sat., the cells grew much faster and reached the stationary
growth phase within 72 h, which shortened the cultivation period by 2 days. The ﬁnal CDM
(7.20.9 g/L VSS) was close to the one with a controlled aeration rate, indicating that
the second aeration strategy increased the productivity of CDM. However, the ﬁnal PHBV
was 2.8 0.6 g/L, much lower than the one with a controlled aeration rate at 2.5 vvm
(4.80.6 g/L PHBV). This suggests a high DO level decreased the PHBV content of cells,
which reduced PHBV production.
The time proﬁles of the HV and HB contents of PHBV produced with different aer-
ation strategies are shown in Figure 5e,f. With a controlled aeration rate of 2.5 vvm, the
HV content increased from 10.0 0.1% wt. to 23.4 2.9% wt. during the exponential
growth phase, then decreased to around 15.5 0.2% wt. at the stationary phase. With a
controlled DO level above 50% sat., the HV content showed a similar trend: it increased to
29.80.4% wt . during the exponential growth phase and dropped to around 21.0 4.4%
wt. in the stationary phase. The ﬁnal HV content obtained from the batches with a DO
above 50% sat. was higher than the ones with lower DO levels during the log phase. There-
fore, although higher DO levels reduced PHBV production, as discussed previously, it led
to higher HV content of PHBV , which may beneﬁt the thermal and mechanical properties
of the bioplastic product.
The consumption of short-chain carboxylates during cell growth is demonstrated in
Figure 5g,h. The ﬁnal consumptions of carboxylates were (average% of initial): 85% La, 98%
Ac, 84% Pr, 76% Bu, and 100% Va in the batches with a controlled aeration rate of 2.5 vvm;
and 99% La, 94% Ac, 77% Pr, 61% Bu, and 100% Va in the batches with DO levels above
50% saturation. In general, the consumption rates of the major carboxylates were much
faster in the batches with DO levels above 50% sat. than in the batches with a controlled
aeration rate at 2.5 vvm. Most of the carboxylates were consumed within 108 h for the
batches with a controlled aeration rate of 2.5 vvm and within 60 h for the batches with a
DO above 50% sat. Since the carboxylates account for most carbon sources in FWP , they
were quickly utilized for faster cell growth, and PHBV synthesis with higher DO levels.
3.5. Effect of Spent Saline Medium Recycling
Two series of SSM recycling experiments were conducted with 80% and 90% mass of
SSM being recycled after H 2O2treatment in four consecutive batches, respectively. The cell
growth curves shown in Figure 6a,b suggest that the cells grew faster and achieved higher
ﬁnal densities in the batches with 80% SSM recycling than the initial batch; similar growth
was found in the batches with 90% SSM recycling except for the second batch. The results of
the CDM and PHBV productions demonstrated in Figure 6c,d aligned well with the growth
curves. With 80% SSM being recycled, the CDM produced in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th recycled
batches were 5.6 0.2, 5.2 0.4, and 5.5 0.2 g/L, which were signiﬁcantly higher than in
the original batch (3.9 0.1 g/L). Regarding PHBV production, only the second recycling
batch (3.6 0.3 g/L PHBV) was signiﬁcantly higher than the original batch (2.6 0.2 g/L
PHBV). The remaining recycling batches, which were 3.30.7 g/L PHBV from the 3rd
batch and 3.2 0.2 g/L PHBV from the 4th batch, had similar productions to the original
one (the differences were not signiﬁcant). With the 90% SSM being recycled, the CDM
(3.00.1 g/L) and PHBV (1.5 0.2 g/L) productions in the second batch were signiﬁcantly
lower than the original batch (4.1 0.1 g/L CDM and 2.6 0.1 g/L PHBV). The PHBV
productions from the third (2.2 0.3 g/L) and fourth batches (2.1 0.0 g/L) were not
signiﬁcantly different from the ﬁrst batch. The reason for the lower CDM and PHBVBioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 13 of 16
productions in the second batch could be the inhibitory compounds in the H 2O2-treated
SSM, such as leftover COD or H 2O2,that limited the cell growth. However, the cells were
able to acclimate to this condition quickly and regained normal growth and PHBV synthesis
in the following recycling batches. The contents of HV of PHBV , illustrated in Figure 6e,f,
increased slightly from 16.1 0.3% to 20.0 0.3% in the batches where 80% SSM was being
recycled and from 17.1 0.8% to 21.2 0.7% in the batches with 90% SSM being recycled.
With 80% of SSM recycling, the HV contents of the PHBV products were higher in the third
and fourth batches; and with 90% of SSM recycling, the HV contents were higher in all
recycling batches. Therefore, in addition to the relatively stable productions of CDM and
PHBV , it can also increase the HV content of the PHBV products. The higher HV content of
PHBV can introduce more ﬂexibility and elasticity to the thermoplastic material, which can
help broaden the product applications.

Both the 80% and 90% SSM recycling experiments suggest a promising potential of 
employing the H 2O2 pretreatment strategy on the SSM to maintain normal cell growth and 
PHBV synthesis from food waste with the use of spent salts. The recycling of SSM can 
provide economic and environmental benefits due to the major savings of purchasing new salts and the costly treatment and disposal of high-saline wastewat er. Another advantage 
is the possibility of achieving better product quality through a significant increase in HV 
content. Based on the findings of this study, a further research interest can be the optimi-
zation of chemical treatment and recycling conditions in a pilot to commercial production 
scale and demonstrating the feasibility and economic efficacy for practical applications. 
4. Discussion 
Fermented food waste can provide sufficient  sources of carbon, nitrogen, and phos-
phorous, with abundant essential nutrients and trace elements to sustain the microbial 
growth of H. mediterranei  for PHBV synthesis. Only additional sodium and magnesium 
salts were needed to provide enough salinity. Therefore, it would result in a reduced pro-duction cost because food waste is an inexpe nsive feedstock with additional tipping fees 
for treatment, and the usage of salts is much le ss [4,35,36]. This study provides a yield of 
0 . 3  g  P H B V / g  C O D ,  w h i c h  i s  c o m p a r a b l e  t o  t h e  y i e l d s  r e p o r t e d  b y  o t h e r  s t u d i e s

HV content. Based on the ﬁndings of this study, a further research interest can be the
optimization of chemical treatment and recycling conditions in a pilot to commercial
production scale and demonstrating the feasibility and economic efﬁcacy for practical
applications.
4. Discussion
Fermented food waste can provide sufﬁcient sources of carbon, nitrogen, and phospho-
rous, with abundant essential nutrients and trace elements to sustain the microbial growth
ofH. mediterranei for PHBV synthesis. Only additional sodium and magnesium salts were
needed to provide enough salinity. Therefore, it would result in a reduced production cost
because food waste is an inexpensive feedstock with additional tipping fees for treatment,
and the usage of salts is much less [ 4,35,36]. This study provides a yield of 0.3 g PHBV/g
COD, which is comparable to the yields reported by other studies [5,14,17,37,38].
To address the hot topic of saline wastewater disposal, a novel salt recovery and
recycling process has been developed to minimize salt discharge in the system. The
recycling of 90% spent salts has been successfully achieved for four consecutive batches
after the treatment by H 2O2. The ﬁnal PHBV production after four recycling batches was
2.10.0 g/L, which was close to the original batch (2.6 0.0 g/L). The contents of HV
and HB from the last batch were 21.2 0.7% and 78.8 0.7%, which were also similar
to those obtained from the original batch (17.1 0.8% and 82.9 0.8%). These results
indicate that recycling spent salts after pretreatment can provide robust PHBV production
from fermented food waste and consistent product qualities. This offers new sustainable
insights into the current research area focusing on halophilic PHA producers and will
further beneﬁt the systematic applicability and proﬁtability.
Besides, the study found that the dynamic dissolved oxygen levels throughout micro-
bial cultivation were critical in terms of inﬂuencing microbial growth and PHBV synthesis
rates, product yield and quality, and metabolic patterns. This DO effect can be further in-
vestigated as a lever to customize the product composition for speciﬁc needs in biomaterial
thermal and mechanical properties.
As one promising inexpensive feedstock, food waste has variable source compositions
and qualities, even for those collected from the same food waste processing facility. These
variables introduce uncertainty and instability to the PHA production processes, which
could potentially risk good manufacturing practices in commercial-scale production. There-
fore, it is necessary to identify the inﬂuence of food waste complexity on PHA production
and optimize the feedstock through viable and economic approaches. Another issue is the
uncertainty of the short-chain carboxylates proﬁle derived from the anaerobic fermentation
process. As the precursors to PHBV synthesis, the proﬁle of carboxylates can signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence product yield and quality. Therefore, further research is needed to ﬁnd ways to
manipulate the anaerobic fermentation process that give the optimum carboxylate proﬁle
to PHA production.
5. Conclusions
This study developed a sustainable bioprocessing system integrating biodegradable
plastic production and the valorization of municipal food waste. Food waste permeates
with optimum levels (40 g/L COD loading and 2.5 vvm of aeration) yielded 0.3 g PHBV/g
COD. A higher DO increases the growth rate but lowers the PHA production. With
H2O2treatment and evaporation, 90% of the spent salts were successfully reused for four
consecutive batches and yielded consistent PHA concentrations and product qualities.Bioengineering 2022 ,9, 630 15 of 16
The production system has the potential for practical applications in bridging current
food and bioplastic industries and provides economic incentives to improve organic waste
management.
