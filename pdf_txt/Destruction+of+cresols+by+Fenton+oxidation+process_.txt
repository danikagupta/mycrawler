Introduction
The presence of many organic contaminants in wastewater,
surface water and ground water may result from contaminatedsoil, agricultural runoff, industrial wastewater and hazardous
compounds storage leakage. The presence of these organic
compounds in water poses serious threat to public health since
most of them are toxic, endocrine disrupting, mutagenic or
potentially carcinogenic to humans, animals and aquatic life in
general. Many organic pollutants are considered as toxic and
detrimental even when present at very less concentrations. For thisreason, their removal from the contaminated water is of high
priority. Consequently, the need for efﬁcient treatment of theseJournal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572

processes developed to decolorize and/or degrade organic pollutants. Fundamentals and main
applications of typical methods such as Fenton, electro-Fenton, photo-Fenton, sono-Fenton, sono-photo-Fenton, sono-electro-Fenton and photo-electro-Fenton are discussed. This review also highlightsthe application of nano-zero valent iron in treating refractory compounds.

treatment methods such as biological processes are not effective
due to the recalcitrant nature of the contaminants present [1,2] .
Therefore, oxidation processes are preferred to degrade such
organics present.
Direct oxidation processes are widely used to degrade bio-
refractory substances. High degradation efﬁciencies are possible
with direct oxidation techniques. However, pollution load, process
limitations and operating conditions are the key factors to be
considered during the selection of most appropriate oxidation
process for a particular compound degradation. Apart from high
degradation efﬁciency, direct oxidation processes demand speci-
ﬁed operating conditions to degrade the target compounds and
this will increase the operation cost of the process [3–7] .
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are alternative wastewa-
ter treatment processes, which are able to degrade biorefractory
organic compounds. AOPs typically operate with less energy
requirement than direct oxidation.
AOPs are near ambient temperature and pressure water
treatment processes which involve the generation of hydroxyl
radicals in sufﬁcient quantity to affect water puriﬁcation [8]. The
hydroxyl radicals are extraordinarily reactive species, which attack
the most part of organic molecules with rate constants usually in
the order of 106–109L mol/C01s/C01[9]. The versatility of AOPs is also
enhanced by the fact that they offer different possible ways for
hydroxyl radical production thus allowing a better compliance
with the speciﬁc treatment requirements. The reduction potential
of various oxidants is presented in Table 1 . Hydroxyl radical is the
second strongest oxidant preceded by the ﬂuorine, and it reacts
106–1012times faster than ozone depending on the substrate to be
degraded [11].
AOPs are classiﬁed according to the reactive phase (homoge-
neous and heterogeneous) or hydroxyl radical generation methods
(chemical, electro-chemical, sono-chemical and photochemical).The classiﬁcation of conventional AOPs based on the source used
for the generation of hydroxyl radicals is presented in Table 2 . The
processes involving combined conventional and non-conventional
AOPs like photo-electro-Fenton and sono-electro-Fenton are
presented. The non-conventional AOPs not presented in the table
include ionizing radiation, microwaves and pulsed plasma
techniques [12]. In addition, solar-irradiated processes were
studied in order to decrease the costs associated with the use of
light from non-natural sources [13]. However, the solar energy
based processes have restricted applications in countries receiving
less solar radiation.
A goal of the wastewater puriﬁcation by means of AOP methods
is the reduction of the chemical contaminants and their toxicity to
such an extent that cleaned wastewater may be reintroduced into
receiving streams or, at least, into a conventional sewage
treatment.Fenton process
Fenton (F) and related reactions encompass reactions of
peroxides (usually hydrogen peroxide (H
2O2)) with iron ions to
form active oxygen species that oxidize organic or inorganic
compounds. The Fenton reaction was discovered by H.J.H. Fenton
in 1894 and he reported that H 2O2could be activated by ferrous
(Fe2+) salts to oxidize tartaric acid [14]. In the last few decades, the
importance of/C15OH reactions has been recognized and over 1700
rate constants for/C15OH reactions with organic and inorganic
compounds in aqueous solution have been tabulated [15]. In the
recent past, Fenton reaction was efﬁciently utilized in wastewater
treatment process for the removal of many hazardous organics
from wastewater [16,17] .
The traditionally accepted Fenton mechanism is represented by
Eqs. (1)–(9) and its reaction rates were well reported in the
literature [18]. Eq. (1)is recognized as Fenton reaction and implies
the oxidation of ferrous to ferric ions to decompose H 2O2into
hydroxyl radicals. It is usually considered as the core of the Fenton
chemistry. Furthermore, other reactions must be considered to
understand the whole process:
Fe2þþH2O2!Fe3þþOH/C0þ/C15OH;k2:1
¼40/C080 L mol/C01s/C01(1)
The generated ferric ions can be reduced by reaction with
excess hydrogen peroxide to form again ferrous ion and more
radicals as shown in Eq. (2). This reaction is called Fenton-like
reaction and slower than Fenton reaction, and allows Fe2+
regeneration in an effective cyclic mechanism. In Fenton likereaction, apart from ferrous ion regeneration, hydroperoxyl
radicals (
/C15O2H) are produced. The hydroperoxyl radicals may also
attack organic contaminants, but they are less sensitive than
hydroxyl radicals. It should be noted that, the iron added in small
amount acts as a catalyst while H 2O2is continuously consumed to
produce hydroxyl radicals.

chemistry since hydrogen peroxide is consumed and ferrous iron is
regenerated from ferric ion through these reactions. Eqs. (6)–(9)
also reported to occur during the Fenton process and they are
radical–radical reactions or hydrogen peroxide–radical reaction:

In the absence or presence of any organic molecule to be
oxidized, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to molecular
oxygen and water occurs according to Eq. (10). This reaction leads
to exploitation of bulk oxidant and thus an unnecessary increase
on treatment cost [19]:
2H2O2!O2þ2H2O (10)
Eqs. (1)–(9) demonstrate that the Fenton process follows a
complex mechanism. The production of desired hydroxyl radical
occurs through the chain initiation reaction (Eq. (1)). However
hydroxyl radicals can be scavenged by ferrous ions (Eq. (3)),
hydrogen peroxide (Eq. (7)), hydroperoxyl radicals (Eq. (9), and/or
even may be auto scavenged (Eq. (6)). The foregoing analysis
indicates that hydrogen peroxide may act both as radical generator
(Eq. (1)) and as scavenger (Eq. (7)). Hydroxyl radicals may attack
organic radicals produced by organics present in the wastewater.
Those radicals form dimmers or react with ferrous and ferric ions,
as shown in Eqs. (11)–(13) [16,19] :
2R/C15!RR (11)
R/C15þFe2þ!R/C0þFe3þ(12)
RþFe3þ!RþþFe2þ(13)
Fenton process can be carried out at room temperature and
atmospheric pressure. In addition, required reagents are readily
available, easy to store and handle, safe and they do not cause
environmental damages [19]. However, two main drawbacks were
identiﬁed. The ﬁrst is related to the wastage of oxidants due to the
radical scavenging effect of hydrogen peroxide (Eq. (7)) and its self-
decomposition (Eq. (10)). The second refers to the continuous loss
of iron ions and the formation of solid sludge. Several economic
and environmental drawbacks have been reported to occur with
Fenton sludge [20]. Thus, technologies allowing an efﬁcient use of
H2O2have to be studied. Furthermore, an attempt has to be made
for the recovery of iron ions and their subsequent recycle and
reuse. Table 3 depicts some of the illustrative work done in recent
years with discussion about the type of the equipment used along
with the experimental conditions and important ﬁndings observed
in the work. Based on the exhaustive analysis of the existing
literature on the application of Fenton oxidation to wastewater
treatment, following optimum conditions is outlined.Operating pH
Fenton process is strongly dependent on the solution pH mainly
due to iron and hydrogen peroxide speciation factors. The
optimum pH for the Fenton reaction was found to be around 3,
regardless of the target substrate [32–35] .
The activity of Fenton reagent is reduced at higher pH due to the
presence of relatively inactive iron oxohydroxides and formation
of ferric hydroxide precipitate [36]. In this situation, less hydroxyl
radicals are generated due to the presence of less free iron ions. The
oxidation potential of hydroxyl radicals decreases with increasing
pH. The oxidation potential for the redox couple/C15OH/H 2O has been
reported to be 2.59 V vs. NHE at pH 0 and 1.64 V vs. NHE at pH 14
[37]. In addition, auto-decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is
accelerated (Eq. (10)) at high pH [38]. At pH below 3, decrease in
degradation efﬁciency was observed [39]. At very low pH values,
iron complex species [Fe(H 2O)6]2+exist, which reacts more slowly
with hydrogen peroxide than other species [40]. This phenomenon
was also inﬂuenced by the concentration of ferrous ion present. In
addition, the peroxide gets solvated in the presence of high
concentration of H+ions to form stable oxonium ion [H 3O2]+.
Oxonium ions make hydrogen peroxide more stable and reduce its
reactivity with ferrous ions [39,41] . Therefore, the efﬁciency of the
Fenton process to degrade organic compounds is reduced both at
high and low pH. Thus an adequate control of pH would increase
process efﬁciency. It should be noted that the type of buffer
solution used also has effect on the degradation process [42]. The
acetic acid/acetate buffer gives maximum oxidation efﬁciency
whereas least is observed with phosphate and sulfate buffers [42].
This can be attributed to the formation of stable Fe3+complexes
that are formed under those conditions [43]. However, reaction
buffering will increase the operating costs and hence, ﬁnal decision
of utilization of buffers varies with situation.
Ferrous ion concentration
Usually the rate of degradation increases with an increase in the
concentration of ferrous ion [27]. However, the extent of increase is
sometimes observed to be marginal above a certain concentration
of ferrous ion as reported by Lin et al. [28], Kang and Hwang [31]
and Rivas et al. [32]. Also, an enormous increase in the ferrous ions
will lead to an increase in the unutilized quantity of iron salts,
which will contribute to an increase in the total dissolved solids
content of the efﬂuent stream and this is not permitted. Thus,
laboratory scale studies are required to establish the optimum
loading of ferrous ions to mineralize the organics.
Hydrogen peroxide concentration
Concentration of hydrogen peroxide plays a crucial role in
deciding the overall efﬁciency of the degradation process.
Usually it has been observed that the % degradation of the
pollutant increases with an increase in the dosage of hydrogen
peroxide [27,28,31,33] . However, care should be taken while
selecting the operating oxidant dosage. The unused portion of
hydrogen peroxide during the Fen ton process contributes to COD
[27] and hence excess amount is not recommended. Also, the
presence of hydrogen peroxi de is harmful to many of the
organisms [44] and will affect the overall degradation efﬁciency
signiﬁcantly, where Fenton oxidation is used as a pretreatment
to biological oxidation. Another negative effect of hydrogen
peroxide is the scavenging of gen erated hydroxyl radicals, which
occurs at large quantities of hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the dosage
of hydrogen peroxide should be adjusted in such a way that the
entire amount is utilized and this can be decided based on the
laboratory scale studies.A. Babuponnusami, K. Muthukumar / Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572 559Table 3

pollutant removal and optimum Fe2+dosage was
found to be 5 mM. H 2O2was completely utilized and
found to be a limiting reactant. Increase in pH from 3 to7 decreased the rate appreciably. Increase in
temperature from 0 to 40 8C showed a variation in
extent of degradation[32]A. Babuponnusami, K. Muthukumar / Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572
560Initial concentration of pollutant
Usually lower initial concentration of the pollutants are favored
[41,42] , but the negative effects of treating large quantity of
efﬂuent needs to be analyzed before the dilution ratio is ﬁxed. For
real industrial wastewater, dilution is essential before any
degradation is effected by Fenton oxidation.
Operating temperature
Limited studies are available depicting the effect of temperature
on the degradation rate. Moreover, ambient conditions can safely
be used with good efﬁciency. In fact, Lin and Lo [27] reported an
optimum temperature of 30 8C, whereas Rivas et al. [32] reported
that the degradation efﬁciency is unaffected even when the
temperature is increased from 10 to 40 8C. If the reaction
temperature is expected to rise beyond 40 8C due to exothermic
nature, cooling is recommended. The efﬁcient utilization of
hydrogen peroxide decreases due to accelerated decomposition
of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen [45].
Chemical coagulation
Chemical coagulation step is recommended after Fenton
oxidation to keep the concentration of the soluble iron with the
speciﬁed limits [27]. Lin et al. [28] have demonstrated the efﬁcacy
of chemical coagulation in controlling the concentration of total
dissolved solids below the speciﬁed limits.
Sono-Fenton process
The oxidation of organics by ultrasound has received consider-
able attention because of its rapid degradation of chemicalcontaminants [46]. Ultrasound is a sound wave with a frequency
greater than the upper limit of human hearing (approximately
20 kHz). In practice, three frequency ranges of ultrasound are
reported for three different uses [47]: (1) the relatively low
frequency range, which is applied for conventional power
ultrasound (20–100 kHz), (2) the medium frequency range, which
is used for sonochemical effects (300–1000 kHz), (3) and the high
frequency range, which is typically used for diagnostic imaging (2–
10 MHz).
The application of ultrasound wave creates expansion and
compression cycles. The expansion cycle causes reduction of
pressure in the liquid, and, if the amplitude of ultrasound pressure
is sufﬁciently large, it can result in acoustic cavitation, a process of
formation, growth, and implosion of bubbles ﬁlled with vapor and/
or gas. The growth and implosion of bubbles are affected by
physical properties of gas and liquid, initial size of gaseous nuclei
present in liquid, and ultrasound frequency and intensity. Before
implosion, the cavities oscillate in size, following the expansion
and compression cycles of the ultrasound wave. When these
cavitations bubbles explosively collapse, the pressure and temper-
ature in the bubbles can reach up to several hundred atmosphere
and several thousand Kelvin, respectively [48–50] . Under these
conditions, organic compounds are decomposed directly by
pyrolytic cleavage. On the other hand, the hydroxyl radicals
formed by pyrolysis also help to degrade the organics. Thus, in
sonochemistry, there are three potential reaction sites: (1) inside
of cavitation bubbles, (2) interfacial region between the cavitation
bubble and liquid phase, and (3) bulk liquid [50].
The hydroxyl radicals are generated by water pyrolysis as
shown in Eq. (14). After that, the radicals can enter into a variety of
chemical reactions in a gas bubble and/or in the bulk solution.
Some typical reactions involved are shown in Eqs. (15)–(18)[51,52] :
H
2OþÞÞÞ!/C15OHþ/C15H (14)
/C15OH!/C15Hþ/C15H2O (15)
2/C15OH!H2Oþ/C15O (16)
2/C15OH!H2O2 (17)
2/C15H!H2 (18)
Hydrophobic chemicals with high vapor pressure have been
proved to undergo mainly thermal decomposition inside the
cavitation bubbles [53,54] . Whereas, hydrophilic compounds with
low vapor pressures tends to remain in the bulk solution.
Therefore, the major reaction site for these compounds is bulk
liquid region, where they can be easily destroyed by an oxidative
degradation. But, sufﬁcient quantities of hydroxyl radicals are
ejected into the liquid phase during the collapse of cavities.
To increase the hydroxyl radical concentration in the bulk
solution, Fenton and sonolysis can be combined together. These
methods utilize the advantages of ultrasound and Fenton’s reagent,
allowing improved degradation of organic pollutants [50]. The
studies reported in the literature related to sono-Fenton (SF)
process on organic compounds degradation are summarized in
Table 4 .
Electro-Fenton process
There is a greater interest in the development of effective
electrochemical treatments for the destruction of toxic and
biorefractory organics [64]. Anodic oxidation and indirect elec-
tro-oxidation are the most usual techniques utilized to achieve the
mineralization of such pollutants. In anodic oxidation, pollutants
are mineralized by direct electron transfer reactions or action of
radical species (hydroxyl radicals) formed on the electrode surface
as shown in Eq. (19):
H2O!/C15OH adsþHþþe/C0(19)
This radical, as discussed previously, is a powerful oxidizing
agent, with an ability to react with organics giving dehydrogenated
or hydroxylated derivatives. Anodic oxidation [65–68] is usually
performed in the anodic compartment of the divided cell, where
the contaminated solution is treated using an anode of Pt, undoped
and doped PbO 2and SnO 2. Under these conditions, however, most
aromatic solutions are poorly mineralized, because of the
generation of hardly oxidizable carboxylic acids.
In electro-Fenton (EF) process, pollutants are destroyed by the
action of Fenton’s reagent in the bulk together with anodicoxidation at the anode surface. Electro-Fenton process is classiﬁed
into four categories depending on Fenton’s reagent addition or
formation. In type 1, hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion are
electro-generated using a sacriﬁcial anode and an oxygen sparging
cathode respectively [69]. In type 2, hydrogen peroxide is
externally added while ferrous ion is produced from sacriﬁcial
anode as shown in Eq. (20) [70] :
Fe!Fe
2þþ2e/C0(20)
In type 3, ferrous ion is externally added and hydrogen peroxide
is generated using an oxygen sparging cathodes [71,72] . In type 4,
hydroxyl radical is produced using Fenton reagent in an
electrolytic cell and ferrous ion is regenerated through the
reduction of ferric ions on the cathode [73,74] . However,
electro-Fenton processes have some problems with respect to
H2O2production. The production of H 2O2is slow because oxygen
has low solubility in water and the current efﬁciency underA. Babuponnusami, K. Muthukumar / Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572 561Table 4

improved the COD removal up to 83.4% at a dosageof 0.038 mol/L Fe

563reduced pH (pH <3) is low [69]. This is due to the formation of
Fe(OH) 3that is slightly reduced to Fe2+. Stoichiometric quantity of
Fe2+can be used at near neutral pH, thus overcoming the need for
acidic conditions, which is a fundamental disadvantage of Fenton
reaction. In principle, the most promising electro-Fenton method is
type 4, in which ferric ion is reduced to ferrous ion at the cathode;
however, Fe2+regeneration is slow even at an optimal current
density [69]. The efﬁciency of electro-Fenton process depends on
electrode nature, pH, catalyst concentration, electrolytes, dissolved
oxygen level, current density and temperature. The studies related
to electro-Fenton process reported in the literature are summa-
rized in Table 5 .
Photo-Fenton processes
A combination of hydrogen peroxide and UV radiation with Fe2+
or Fe3+oxalate ion (photo-Fenton (PF) process) produces more
hydroxyl radicals compared to conventional Fenton method or
photolysis and in turn increases the rate of degradation of organic
pollutants [82–84] . Fenton reaction accumulates Fe3+ions in the
system and the reaction does not proceed once all Fe2+ions are
consumed. The photochemical regeneration of ferrous ions (Fe2+)
by photo-reduction (Eq. (21)) of ferric ions (Fe3+) occurs in photo-
Fenton reaction [85]. The newly generated ferrous ions react with
H2O2and generate hydroxyl radical and ferric ion, and the cycle
continues:
FeðOHÞ2þþhn!Fe2þþ/C15OH (21)
The studies reported in the literature showed that the
combination of Fenton reaction with conventional radiation zone
of the visible and near ultraviolet gives a better degradation of
organic pollutants. Pollutants such as 4-chlorophenol [86],
nitrobenzene and anisole [87], herbicides [83] and ethyleneglycol
[88] were degraded effectively by photo-Fenton process.
Direct photolysis of H 2O2(Eq. (22)) produces hydroxyl radicals
which can be used for the degradation of organic compounds.
However, in the presence of iron complexes, which strongly absorb
radiation, this reaction will contribute only to a lesser extent for
the photo-degradation of organic contaminants [89,90] :
H2O2þhn!2/C15OH (22)
The photo-Fenton process offers better performance at pH 3.0,
when the hydroxy–Fe3+complexes are more soluble and Fe(OH)2+
are more photoactive [91].
The photo-Fenton process was reported as more efﬁcient than
Fenton treatment [84]. In some cases, use of sunlight instead of UV
irradiation reduced the costs. However, this offers a lower
degradation rate of pollutants. Acidic conditions (about pH 3)
were also reported to be favorable and this may be mainly due to
the conversion of carbonate and bicarbonate species into carbonic
acid, which has a low reactivity with hydroxylradicals [92].
De Oliveira et al. [90] compared the performance of Fenton and
photo-Fenton processes for the treatment of painting industry
efﬂuent (COD = 80.75 mg/L) and reported higher COD and TOC
removal with solar-assisted photo-Fenton process compared to
Fenton treatment or when an artiﬁcial radiation source was used.
The performance comparison study made with three iron sources
such as FeSO 4, Fe(NO 3)3and potassium ferrioxalate (K 3[Fe(C 2O4)3],
obtained by mixing Fe(NO 3)3with K 2C2O4solutions). The
formation of Fe3+complex when Fe(NO 3)3was used resulted in
poor performance, whereas the addition of K 3[Fe(C 2O4)3] increased
the carbon loading of the wastewater. In the presence of 15 mM of
Fe2+and 300 mM of H 2O2, 99.5% COD reduction was reported when
the wastewater was irradiated with solar radiation for 6 h.Amat et al. [93] compared the degradation of two commercial
anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and dodecyl-
benzenesulfonate, using Fenton reagents (Fe2+or Fe3+with H 2O2in
the presence or absence of solar radiation), photo-catalysis (TiO 2
with solar irradiation) and photo-degradation using solar sensi-tizer (pyrylium salt). They demonstrated that the addition of the
solar sensitizer did not efﬁciently degrade the surfactants and their
further studies concluded that the photo-Fenton processes using
solar radiation (0.1 mM of Fe
2+or Fe3+, and 1 mM H 2O2) had a
higher rate of surfactant degradation than that of solar-TiO 2
treatment. The illustrative works related to photo-Fenton processreported in the literature are presented in Table 6 .
Sono-photo-Fenton process
The combined treatment using ultrasound and ultraviolet along
with Fenton reagent is known as sono-photo-Fenton (SPF) process,
which enhanced the production of hydroxyl radicals in an aqueous
system signiﬁcantly. Sonolysis of water produces hydroxyl radicals
and hydrogen atoms. However, signiﬁcant loss of
/C15H and/C15OH
species occurs due to the recombination. On the other hand, the
application of UV light, converted the hydrogen peroxide produced
by recombination of hydroxyl radicals, and in turn increased the
amount/C15OH[100] . The intermediate complex formed due to the
reaction of Fe3+with H 2O2during the Fenton reaction could be
reduced to Fe2+by sonolysis [57] and photolysis [69].
The direct photolysis ( l<400 nm) of H 2O2also generates
hydroxyl radicals (Eq. (22)) and the process is cyclic one with
respect to Fe2+ions. The amount of ferrous salt required under SPF
condition is very small compared to Fenton condition, where
ferrous ions need to be added at regular intervals to continue the
reaction. Otherwise, reaction will stop after the completeconversion of ferrous ions into ferric ions. SPF process reduces
the amount of ferrous ions present in the treated water, and this is
very important in an industrial point of view [101] .
Segura et al. [102] investigated the application of SPF process
for the degradation of phenol using Fe
2O3/SBA-15 as a heteroge-
neous catalyst. The initial pH was maintained at 3. TOC
degradation of 45% was observed with sono-photo-Fenton process
whereas 30% and 40% TOC degradation was observed with sono-
Fenton and photo-Fenton processes, respectively.
Mendez-Arriaga et al. [103] investigated the degradation of
recalcitrant pharmaceutical micro-pollutant ibuprofen (IBP) by
means of sono-photo-Fenton, sono-photo-catalysis and TiO 2/Fe2+/
sonolysis processes. The presence of ultrasound irradiation in
photo-Fenton process improved the iron catalytic activity and
ibuprofen degradation and mineralization to 95% and 60%,
respectively. On the other hand, total removal of ibuprofen and
elimination of more than 50% of dissolved organic carbon were
observed by photocatalysis with TiO 2in the presence of ultrasound
irradiation. The results showed that, the hybrid system is a
promising method for complete elimination/mineralization of the
recalcitrant micro-contaminant ibuprofen.
Vaishnave et al. [101] conducted a study on degradation of
azure-B by sono-photo-Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. The
degradation rate was found to be strongly dependent on initial pH,
initial concentration of azure-B, Fe2+concentration, H 2O2concen-
tration and UV light intensity. The effects of these parameters were
studied and the optimum operational conditions of these processes
were found. The optimum conditions obtained for
1.33/C210/C04mol/L of azure-B was: pH 2.1; H 2O20.5 mL; Fe3+
5.0/C210/C04mol/L; ultrasonic frequency 40 kHz; and light intensity
75.5 mW/cm2. The results showed that the dye was completely
oxidized and degraded into CO 2and H 2O.
Zhong et al. [104] studied the degradation of C.I. Acid Orange 7
(AO7) by the integrated heterogeneous sono-photo-Fenton processA. Babuponnusami, K. Muthukumar / Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572 564using mesostructured silica (Fe 2O3/SBA-15) as heterogeneous
catalyst. The effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration, initial
pH, Fe 2O3/SBA-15 loading, ultrasonic power and initial solution
concentration on the decolorization was investigated. The results
showed that the degradation efﬁciency increased with an increase
in hydrogen peroxide concentration, ultrasonic power, Fe 2O3/SBA-
15 loading, but decreased with an increase in initial pH and initial
dye concentration. The particle size distribution of spent catalyst
evidenced a remarkable size reduction during reaction, leading to
more reaction surface and higher mass transfer rate. The reaction
intermediates were identiﬁed using GC–MS and degradation
pathway was proposed.Sono-electro-Fenton process
Many researchers have reported the coupling strategy between
sonochemistry and different AOPs such as the Fenton process
giving rise to the concept of advanced sonochemical hybrid
techniques that possess signiﬁcantly greater efﬁcacy for water
remediation [105–107] . Hydroxyl radicals produced by water
decomposition (Eq. (14)) are used for the degradation of organics
[107] .

2+
concentration from 0.4 to 1.2 mM/L increased therate of degradation. Photo-Fenton process is moreeconomical with a 32% energy reduction ascompared to UV/H
2O2system[94]
2 Mono-di-and-tri-nitrotoluene Glass tubes of 18 mL capacity (18 in total) was
used as reactor and was irradiated with UV light
having an incident intensity of 21 W/cm2and at
308CThe order of degradation was UV Fenton
(pH = 3) >dark Fenton >UV-Fenton
(pH = 6.1) >UV/H 2O2>H2O2. The degradation of
nitro toluene follows pseudo ﬁrst order and rateconstants have been given for differenttechniques. Humic acid showed a little inhibitingeffect on degradation process[95]
3 Pesticide industry efﬂuents
containing mixture of componentsCylindrical (30 mL) borosilicate reactor irradiated
with 16 ﬂuorescent black lamps of 14 W each was
used. Temperature of reaction was maintained at
258CComplete removal of pesticide was observed
within 30 min of reaction time except for
methoxychlor for which, the removal was
approximately 80%. Optimum pH was obtained as2.8. Thermal pretreatment increased the rates ofreaction by photo-Fenton mechanism[96]
4 Dichloroacetic acid and
2,4-dichlorophenolCylindrical upﬂow reactor with annular
irradiation by 15 W black light lamp with acapacity of 280 mL was used. 700 mL of efﬂuent
can be treated with recirculated mode operationOptimum pH for degradation was observed in the
range of 2.5–2.8 and hydrogen peroxideconsumption is high at this operating pH range.
Removal efﬁciency reaches steady state at
concentration of H
2O2of 6 mM and 1.5 mM of
ferroxalate ions. Complete degradation wasobserved at 30 W/m
2and linear variation with
light intensity was observed[97]
5 Reactive Black 5 and
Reactive Black Blue 21 dyesAnnular borosilicate glass reactor equipped with
20 W black light ﬂuorescent lamps was used.Operating temperature of 20 8C was maintained
throughout the reaction. 1000 mL of efﬂuent was
used and pH was maintained at 4. TiO
2(1 g/L) was
used as photo-catalyst to compare with photo-Fenton processPartial chemical oxygen demand removal was
observed by adsorption with the photo-catalystwhere as <10% chemical oxygen demand removal
was observed with Fenton chemistry alone. First
order kinetics was observed for all the systemsstudied and rate constant for the decolorizationprocess was in the order of Fe
2+/UV/H 2O2>Fe3+/
UV/H 2O2>UV/TiO 2. Use of advanced oxidation
processes resulted in lowering the toxicitytoward bacterial treatment[98]
6 Catechol Cylindrical pyrex vessel of 300 mL volume was
ﬁlled with 100 mL catechol solution and was
degraded using photo-catalysis and photo-Fenton experiments. All experiments werecarried out at room temperature. A 125 W blacklight ﬂuorescent lamp (350 nm) was used as thelight source. pH of the solution was maintained at3 for all the experimentsThe optimum H
2O2/FeSO 4ratio at pH 3, 30 rpm
and 30 min reaction time was determined as 600/
500 (W/W). Under these conditions, 83% and 98%of chemical oxygen demand removal wasobtained for Fenton and photo-Fenton processes,respectively. Although a good removal wasachieved by photo-catalysis process, a signiﬁcanthigher irradiation time was required compared toFenton and photo-Fenton processes, which may
result in an increased energy cost[29]
7 Phenol A cylindrical pyrex glass reactor containing 1 L of
aqueous solution of pollutant and catalyst wasused. A 150 W medium pressure mercury lampwas used as the irradiation source. The reactiontemperature was maintained at 25 8C throughout
the reaction and pH was maintained at 5.5Iron containing SBA-15 catalyst consisting of
crystalline hematite particle was reported as apromising catalyst for the treatment of phenolicsolution. The stability of the catalyst toward ironleaching is strongly dependent on oxidant tocatalyst ratio. Catalyst loading of 0.5 g/L and
hydrogen peroxide concentration of 2450 mg/L
showed a total abatement of phenol andremarkable organic mineralization[99]A. Babuponnusami, K. Muthukumar / Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572
565cathode (15 mm /C210 mm /C25 mm). The reactor was coupled to a
piezoelectric transducer of 124 kHz and 100 V for treating 100 mL
of 0.1 mM dye solution with different Fe2+concentration at pH 2
and 25 8C. An apparent rate constant of 2.4 /C210/C02min/C01was
reported for the decolorization with 0.5 mM Fe2+(optimum
catalyst content) at Ecat=/C00.7 V/Ag, which is twice the value
obtained for electro-Fenton process. Under these conditions, the
COD was reduced by 61% after 100 min of sono-electro-Fenton
(SEF) treatment.
Yasman et al. [109] studied the degradation of common
herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and its deriva-
tive 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) using SEF process. A cylindrical
glass reactor containing ultrasonic generator (75 W and 20 kHz)
was immersed from the top of the reactor. Both cathode and anode
were made up of nickel foil (0.125 mm thin) in the form of
cylindrical segment of 11 mm radius and 20 mm height. Temper-
ature of the solution was maintained at 25 8C by circulating water
in a double jacket cooling array. Complete degradation of 2,4-D
(1.2 mM) was found using 3 mM Fe2+and H 2O2at a reaction time of
60 s. Thus, the time required for the degradation was considerably
shorter for SEF scheme when compared to F and SF scheme. This
result indicates that the SEF process is an effective method for the
detoxiﬁcation of wastewater.
Oturan et al. [110] investigated the effect of EF and SEF process
for the degradation of herbicides namely 2,4-dichlorophenoxya-
cetic acid (2,4-D) (1 mM)), 4,6-dinitro-o-cresol (0.5 mM) and
azobenzene (0.1 mM). The process was carried out using 0.1 mM
Fe3+in O 2saturated solution with 0.05 M Na 2SO4at pH 3 and at
200 mA of current intensity. For SEF process, either a low
frequency of 28 kHz or high frequency of 460 kHz was applied
with in an output power range from 20 to 80 kW. Complete
degradation of 2,4-D was achieved in 80 min using 20 W output.
The results showed that the nature of the organic structure of
compounds plays an important role in SEF. The improvementyielded by SEF at 20 W was ascribed to (i) the enhancement of the
transfer of reactants Fe
3+and O 2toward the cathode for the electro
generation of Fe2+and H 2O2; (ii) the additional generation of
hydroxyl radicals by sonolysis of water and (iii) the pyrolysis of
organics due to the cavitaion promoted by ultrasound irradiation.
Li et al. [111] evaluated the effect of low frequency ultrasonic
irradiation on the sono-electro-Fenton oxidation of cationic red X-
GRL. Ultrasonic irradiation signiﬁcantly increased the hydrogen
peroxide production rate and reduced the time needed to reach the
maximum hydrogen peroxide concentration. In addition, ultra-
sonic irradiation has a considerable effect on the degradation of
cationic red X-GRL. The results showed that the degradation rate
followed pseudo-ﬁrst order kinetics and also decolorization rate
increased with ultrasonic power. Furthermore, total organic
carbon removal efﬁciency and mineralization current efﬁciency
were greatly promoted in sono-electro-Fenton process compared
to electro-Fenton process. These results proved that sono-electro-
Fenton process is a promising technology in terms of colored
wastewater treatment.
Martinez and Uribe [112] investigated the degradation of Azure
B dye by Fenton, sonolysis and sono-electro-Fenton process
employing ultrasound at 23 kHz and the electrolytic generation
of hydrogen peroxide at the reticulated vitreous carbon electrode.
The dye degradation followed apparent ﬁrst-order kinetics in all
the degradation processes. The rate constant was affected by pH
and initial concentration of ferrous ion, with the highest
degradation obtained at pH between 2.6 and 3. The rate constant
for Azure B degradation by sono-electro-Fenton is 10 times higher
than that of sonolysis and 2 times larger than that of Fenton
process. The COD removal of 68% and 85% was obtained by Fenton
and sono-electro-Fenton process, respectively and 90% removal of
Azure B was observed with both the processes.Photo-electro-Fenton process
The catalytic effect of Fe2+in the electro-Fenton process can be
enhanced by irradiating the contents with UV light. Thus, the
combination of electrochemical and photochemical process with
Fenton process is called photo-electro-Fenton (PEF) process
generates greater quantity of free radicals due to the combination
effect [113,114] . The direct photolysis of acid solution containing
peroxide generates hydroxyl radicals through the hemolytic
breakdown of the peroxide molecule according to Eq. (22). This
reaction increased the oxidative capability of the process due to the
additional production of hydroxyl radicals. Thus, the degradation
of target organic substrate can be enhanced when the solution is
irradiated with UV light in addition to the application of electro-
Fenton process. Photochemical regeneration of Fe2+by the photo-
reduction of Fe3+ions and photo-activation of complexes renders
the photo-electro-Fenton systems more efﬁcient [115,116] .A t
acidic pH, oxalic acids behave as the photo-active complexes in the
presence of ferric ions which undergo photo-decarboxylation
reaction [19] as shown in Eq. (23):
RðCO2Þ/C0FeðIIIÞþhn!RðCO2/C15ÞþFeðIIÞþR/C15þCO2 (23)
The studies pertaining to the application of PEF process are very
limited and most of the studies are related to the treatment of
herbicide [113,115–117] , 4-chloro-2-methylphenol [118] and
dyes [78]. Flox et al. [119] recently used solar photo-energy as
photon source and reduced the operating costs of the process
substantially. The various studies carried out using photo-electro-
Fenton process are summarized in Table 7 . Some of the illustrative
works in recent years have been discussed in detail so as to
establish the optimum operating parameters and other critical
considerations for attaining maximum efﬁciency of this hybrid
oxidation technique.
Nano-zero valent iron mediated degradation
In homogeneous Fenton and combined processes, the main
disadvantage is the requirement of 50–80 ppm ferrous ion and this
value is much above standards. In addition, the application of
homogeneous AOPs to treat large quantity of water may produce
large amount of sludge in the ﬁnal neutralization step [123] .I n
order to avoid these disadvantages, nano-zero valent iron (NZVI)
could be used as an alternative way to induce Fenton oxidation.
Zero valent state metals (such as Fe0,Z n0,S n0and Al0) are
surprisingly effective agents for the remediation of contaminated
ground water [124,125] . In particular, it has been the subject of
numerous studies over the last 10 years and this is an interestingly
popular choice for treatment of hazardous and toxic wastes, and
for remediation of contaminated sites.
Fenton like reactions using nano-zero valent iron
In heterogeneous Fenton reaction, oxidation of NZVI provides
an alternative means of inducing Fenton oxidation [126,127] as
shown in Eq. (24):
O2þFe0þ2Hþ!Fe2þþH2O2 (24)
Use of NZVI to induce Fenton oxidation has two advantages
beyond addition of Fe2+/H2O2[128] :
/C15NZVI is able to attach or coat on large particle, therefore NZVI
absorbed media could treat contaminated water passing through
a sand ﬁlter or other type of ﬁltration system.
/C15NZVI injected through wells could be immobilized in/on soil
grains in contaminated aquifers.A. Babuponnusami, K. Muthukumar / Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572 566Table 7

solution were irradiated with a Philips 6 W
ﬂuorescent bulb ( l= 360 nm)PEF process showed a fast and complete removal of
herbicides in the pH range of 2–4, operating at low
current and 1 mM Fe2+. Whereas only 60–65% of
mineralization was achieved by electro-Fentonprocess. The herbicide degradation follows pseudoﬁrst order kinetics. All oxalate complexes producedat the end of the treatment are rapidly photo-decarboxylated by UV light in the photo-electro-Fenton treatment[116]

benzoic acidUndivided cylindrical stirred electrochemical cell
was used for all electrolysis process. Platinum sheetand carbon-PTFE fed with an O
2ﬂow rate of 20 mL/
min was used as anode and cathode respectively. A6 W Philips ﬂuorescent light (

the top was used as the irradiation source. Fe2+
concentration of 1 mM was used and thetemperature was maintained at 25 8C. The initial pH
of solution was maintained at 3Electro-Fenton process showed 60–70%
mineralization, whereas photo-electro-Fentonprocess showed a fast and complete degradation ofherbicide solution at low current by the action of UVirradiation. The degradation of herbicide followspseudo-ﬁrst order kinetics. The fast photo-
decarboxylation of stable complexes explained the
highest oxidation ability of photo-electro-Fentonprocess[115]
4 Indigo carmine dye Experiments were conducted in an open, one
compartment and thermo static cylindrical glass cell.The anode was either Pt foil or BDD thin ﬁlm and thecathode was carbon-PTFE. The reactor was fed withpure O
2for the continuous production of H 2O2.A6W
ﬂuorescent bulb ( l= 360 nm) was used as the
irradiation source. The Fe2+and Cu2+concentrations
used were in the range of 0.25 and 1.0 mM. Allexperiments were carried out at 35 8C. The
mineralization of indigo carmine solutions wasmonitored by the removal of their total organiccarbon and the intermediates were identiﬁed byHPLCComplete mineralization was achieved using photo-
electro-Fenton method with BDD anode and 1.0 mMFe
2+and 0.25 mM Cu2+as the catalyst. The
corresponding optimum pH value obtained was 3.Mineralization was enhanced with increasing
current density. The Fe
3+–oxalate complexes are
destructed under the action of ultraviolet light. Thedegradation followed pseudo-zero order kinetics[78]
5 Cloﬁbric acid Open, undivided thermostatic cylindrical cell stirred
with magnetic bar was used for the electrolysis. A3c m
2Pt sheet and 3 cm2carbon-PTFE was used as
the anode and the cathode respectively. The O 2ﬂow
rate of 12 mL/min was used to generate H 2O2
electrolytically. A low pressure Philips ﬂuorescentbulb (
l= 360 nm) was used as the irradiation source.
Fe2+concentration of 1 mM and a current of 0.1 A was
usedTOC removal of 86% was obtained in EF process
whereas 96% TOC decay and completedechlorination were observed in PEF process. Decayof cloﬁbric acid followed pseudo ﬁrst order kineticsfor EF and PEF processes. The Fe
3+–oxalate
complexes formed were efﬁcientlyphotodecarboxylated in PEF under the action of UVlight[76]
6 Benzene sulfonic acid A 3.5 L cylindrical reactor ﬁtted with titanium net
coated RuO
2/IrO 2(DSA) was used as anode and
stainless steel as cathode was used. Sixteen 3 W UVlamps (
l>320 nm) were used as the irradiation
source. All experiments were carried out at roomtemperature. Fe
2+concentration of 8 mM and H 2O2
concentration of 166 mM at pH 2 with a currentdensity of 71 A/m
2was used for mineralizationThe double cathode reactor increases the working
area and enhances the current efﬁciency by 75% andthis would cause greater production of ferrous ion.The maximum TOC removal efﬁciency of 72% wasachieved at the optimum electrode distance of 3 cm.Synergistic effect of photoelectron-Fenton method
showed a COD removal efﬁciency of 14% higher than
that of electro-Fenton process[69]
7 Real wastewater
(COD: 24,000 mg/L)A 4 L capacity reactor with a UV light source
(
l= 365 nm) ﬁxed inside the cylindrical pyrex tube
was used. The reaction solutions were mixed using acirculation pump with 200 mg/L ferric sulfate anddifferent H
2O2dosage supplied continuously at room
temperature. The anode was Ti rod coated with IrO 2/
RuO 2(DSA) and cathode was a cylindrical Ti-DSA
grid. The pH of the solution was adjusted andmaintained at 2The TOC removal of 98% and 99% was achieved by
semi batch electro-Fenton and semi batch photo-electro-Fenton method, respectively. The optimumFe
2+and H 2O2concentrations were found to be
200 mg/L and 6 mL/min, respectively. The otheroptimum conditions were pH 2, current intensity
20 A and 420 min of reaction time. The electro-
generated Fe
2+ions were efﬁciently used to produce
hydroxyl radicals and prevented H 2O2from overﬂow[121]
8 Sulfomethaxazole Undivided two electrode quartz cell stirred by using
a magnetic stirrer was used. The anode was a RuO 2/Ti
mesh and a cathode was ACF felt. O 2was fed into the
solution at a rate of 100 mL/min prior to electrolysisfor 30 min. The UV lamp (254/365 nm) was placed
parallel to the side of the cell at a distance of 5 cm
from the solution. Solution pH was maintained at 3.Fe
2+of 1 mM and current of 0.36 A were maintained
throughout the experimentsThe applied current of 0.3 A showed a faster and
more complete degradation. TOC removal of 80% wasobserved after 6 h electrolysis. In electrolysis processonly 63% mineralization was achieved due tocarboxylic acids production as intermediates. But
those complexes were rapidly removed by PEF
because of quicker photo-degradation by the UVlight[122]A. Babuponnusami, K. Muthukumar / Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572
567Tang and Chen [129] investigated the effect of iron powder and
H2O2on degradation of azo dyes and phenolic compounds. At pH
below 2.5, dye removal was found to be mainly by adsorption
whereas, at higher pH, the adsorption was less important. The
addition of H 2O2doubled the dye removal and was greater than 90%.
Takemura et al. [130] investigated the inﬂuence of steel wool,
steel foil, and reticulated iron in the presence of hydrogen peroxide
on the oxidation of perchloroethylene (PCE). The solids mentioned
above reduced the PCE concentration from 100 mg/L to <0.1 mg/L
in 24 h. The reaction with reticulated iron could be conducted at
pH 5–9 with no apparent iron-oxide by product.
Joo et al. [131] have observed the oxidation of organic
compounds in aqueous solution when mixed with nano scale
zero valent iron particles in the presence of air and no added H 2O2.
Evidently, H 2O2and Fe2+are generated by dioxygen corrosion of
the metal and released into solution, or react on the surface. This
represents a novel use of zero-valent iron, normally a reducing
agent, for the oxidation reaction that has potential application for
soil treatment.
Joo et al. [126] studied about the ability of NZVI to induce
oxidative degradation of contaminants. This study demonstrated
that NZVI was capable of degrading the herbicide molinate in the
presence of oxygen. In this study, it was shown that NZVI-induced
Fenton oxidation could degrade over 60% of molinate at pH 8.1 and
65% at pH 4. Subsequent to this investigation, Feitz et al. [132]
reported that NZVI under the optimal column conﬁguration
showed more than 90% removal of 100 ppb molinate in 3 h. While
NZVI appears to induce oxidation effectively at low pH, the
accumulation of ferric oxyhydroxides on the surface of Fe0in
neutral to slightly alkaline environments is expected to reduce the
reactive surface area for the formation of hydroxyl radical and
hence, reduce the efﬁciency of NZVI remediation.
Bergendahl and Thies [128] have investigated the feasibility of
oxidative removal of methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) using ZVI.
The results showed that over 99% of MTBE in water was degraded
within 10 min and the major oxidation product was acetone. The
addition of H 2O2greatly enhanced the degradation efﬁciency. The
rate of degradation of MTBE increases with an increase in
H2O2:MTBE ratio.
Simultaneous use of NZVI and complexes such as ethylene-
diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) showed complete destruction of
refractory compounds [133] . The use of ultrasound with this ZVI–
EDTA system could improve the degradation of organic com-
pounds due to the synergistic effect [134–137] . Zhou et al. [134]
studied the simultaneous degradation of 4CP and EDTA in a
heterogeneous ultrasound/Fenton like system at ambient condi-
tions. The results showed weak relationship between 4-chlor-
ophenol and EDTA.
Besides wastewater treatment, the contaminated soil remedi-
ation comprises one of the important domains of environmental
engineering. Supported and catalyzed iron nanoparticles have
been utilized for the remediation of contaminated soil and ground
water [138,139] . Xu and Zhou [140] conducted batch and column
experiments to investigate the feasibility of NZVI particles for in
situ reductive immobilization of Cr(VI) in water and in a sandy
loam soil. Batch kinetic tests showed that 0.08 g/L of NZVI could
able to rapidly reduce 34 mg/L of Cr(VI) in water at an initial
pseudo ﬁrst order rate constant of 0.08 h/C01. Column experiments
indicated that the stabilized NZVI particles are highly deliverable
in the soil column and reduce the TCLP leachability of Cr in the soil
by 90%.
The iron minerals in combination with H 2O2were used to study
the natural attenuation of organic compounds in the environment,
or to serve as an alternative to Fenton type treatment [141] .
Although oxidation is generally much slower than the correspond-
ing solution reaction at the same mole per liter reagentconcentrations, the heterogeneous reactions are sometimes more
efﬁcient; that is, they consume less peroxide per mole of
contaminant degraded. Oxidation at the surface is often speculated
but there is little compelling evidence and further study is clearly
warranted.
Fenton like reactions using immobilized nano-zero valent iron
NZVI was successfully used for the generation of hydroxyl
radicals in AOP system [142–144] . Due to their larger speciﬁc
surface area and reactive sites, NZVI has gained prominence in
environmental remediation [143] . Although NZVI particles were
successfully used in wastewater treatment, there are still some
drawbacks associated with the process and needs to be addressed.
For example, NZVI could coalesce into aggregates, which reduced
the reactivity [145] and ﬁltration is required to remove NZVI
particles at the end of the treatment. To overcome these problems,
NZVI particles were immobilized in or on suitable solid supports,
and also to expand the effective pH range of the Fenton reaction.
Some success in this regard was achieved with PVA microsphere
[146,147] . The others include calcium alginate beads [148] , iron
exchanged with Naﬁon membranes [149] , iron modiﬁed clays
[150,151] . The modiﬁed supporting materials such as silica fabric
[152] ,A l 2O3[153] , zeolites [154] , resins [155] , and cotton [156]
which are used for immobilization of iron ions could be used for
immobilizing NZVI. The main advantage of the heterogeneous
catalyst is its separation from the waste stream. The fundamental
disadvantage is that the dissolved target molecules must diffuse to
the surface to reach active sites before they are degraded.
PVA-alginate beads were used for immobilization of NZVI. The
PVA-alginate beads showed improved durability and strength
[157] . PVA consists of many hydroxyl groups, which generally form
complexes with metal ions [158] . Thus, the usage of these beads
avoids or alleviates the problems associated with the release of
iron into wastewater [146] .
Naﬁon is a perﬂuorinated oxyalkyl polymer with sulfonate
groups capable of binding cations. Ferric exchanged Naﬁon
membrane is claimed to be an effective photo-Fenton catalyst
[149,159] . Fe-Naﬁon membranes appear to be effective up to an
operational pH of 5. Although it was possible to achieve
mineralization of 2,4-dichlorophenol at higher initial pH (up to
11), the pH(unbuffered) always drifted quickly to a value below 5
[160] . The detailed mechanism covering the role of surface
reaction and of adsorption/desorption of iron ions and reactants
in Fe-Naﬁon systems is unclear. Fernandez et al. [161] showed that
Naﬁon bound Fe(III) could be photo-reduced to Fe(II), which
subsequently undergoes the Fenton reaction. Some disadvantages
of Naﬁon membrane for practical application is their higher cost
and these membranes are not totally inert. Fluorinated radicals
were found in solutions exposed to Naﬁon, which are produced by
photo-Fenton reaction [162] .
The use of novel structured inorganic silica fabrics loaded with
Fe ions (Fe-EGF) by exchange–impregnation as a heterogeneous
photo-catalyst was an alternative approach proposed to degrade
organic compounds [152] . It was proved that the degradation of
oxalates on the Fe-silica fabric was due to Fe ions leaching into
solution that were re-adsorbed onto the silica fabric when
compounds were mineralized.
Ferric species were also immobilized on different types of ion
exchange resins and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the
degradation of cationic and anionic dye pollutants under visible
light ( l>450 nm) irradiation in the presence of H 2O2. The cationic
dyes are effectively photo-degraded on a cationic resin exchanged
Fe(III) catalyst and the anionic dye is photo-degraded on an anionic
resin supported catalyst [155] .A. Babuponnusami, K. Muthukumar / Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 2 (2014) 557–572 568Ramirez et al. [163] studied the removal of orange II dye
solution using heterogeneous photo-electro-Fenton process
using different iron supporting materials. Spectroscopic
analysis and TOC results indicate that the process can be
carried out with any of the iron supporting material used in
this study. Amberlite and Purolite resins can be incorporated
with 59 and 65 mg Fe/g of substrate, but a Naﬁon membrane
can ﬁx 45 mg/g of supporting material. Iron desorption
analysis indicates that more than 90% of iron was retained
by naﬁon membrane.
The performance of a Fe3+-exchanged zeolite Y [154,164]
and Fe-Zm5 zeolite [165] as a heterogeneous photo-Fenton
catalyst was tested for the degradation of organic compounds.
Although some leaching of Fe3+was observed, it amounted to
only few percent of the total iron present in the zeolites (0.3–
2 mg/L in solution) which did not play a major role in the
reaction.
A common characteristic of designed heterogeneous catalyst
for photo-electro-Fenton reaction is that the optimal pH is
generally 3. These materials are, however, efﬁcient at higher pH
values and leaching is minimized under these conditions. The
contribution of heterogeneous photo-electro-Fenton process
depends on the kind of catalyst, experimental conditions and
target contaminants. In fact, the dissolved iron concentration in the
solution is time dependent and the change in optical properties of
photo-reactor. An interesting phenomenon was observed for most
of the proposed catalyst, that, the leached iron ions are found to re-
adsorb on catalyst surface allowing to maintain good catalyst
stability.
An ideal supporting material for iron species is expected to
have the following attributes : (a) to favor strong surface
chemical–physical binding with the iron particles without
affecting their reactivity; (b) to have high speciﬁc surface area;
(c) to have good adsorption capacity for the organic com-pounds to be degraded; (d) to b e in a physical conﬁguration
which favors the ultimate liquid-solid phase separation; (e) to
allow a reactor design that facilitates the mass transfer
processes; and (f) to be chemic ally inert. From the immobili-
zation point of view, a good adh erence catalyst/support, and no
degradation of the catalyst activity by the attachment process
are important. The ﬁrst condition is essential, since the
support/catalyst junction should resist to the stress derived
from particle to particle and pesticide-ﬂuid mechanical
interactions in the reactor environment, in order to avoid
detachment of catalyst particles from the support [166] .
Thus, the overall efﬁciency of the degradation can be
signiﬁcantly enhanced when hybrid processes are used. Especially,
use of immobilized NZVI as Fenton catalyst in hybrid treatment
processes showed better performance in treating refractory
compounds.
Conclusions and recommendations
Advanced oxidation processes are found to be an environmental
friendly process for the degradation of refractory compounds.
Different AOPs have been reported to select the most appropriate
technique for the speciﬁc treatment. Major attention should be
devoted in the future on the identiﬁcation of reaction inter-
mediates, development of rate expressions based on established
reaction mechanisms, identiﬁcation of scale-up parameters and
criteria for cost effectiveness.
Hybrid methods are not economically viable techniques to
degrade large quantum of efﬂuent disposed by the industries.
Hence it is advisable to use these methods as pretreatment to
reduce the toxicity to a certain level beyond which biologicaltreatment can be employed. These combined methods expected toreduce the reactor size and decrease the operating cost. However,
the oxidants added during the pretreatment should be completely
eliminated before subjecting to the biological treatment as they
may act as inhibitors to the microorganism. On the other hand, the
different AOPs were found to follow similar mechanism and hence,
the may be combined in various manners to obtain maximum
efﬁciency.
