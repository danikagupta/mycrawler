Known to be Human Carcinogens: 
There is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans which indicates a 
causal relationship between exposure to the agent, substance or mixture and human cancer. 
Reasonably Anticipated to be Human Carcinogens: 
There is limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans which indicates that causal interpretation is credible but that alternative explanations such as chance, bias or confounding factors could not adequately be excluded; or 
There is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals 
which indicates there is an increased incidence of malignant and/or a combination of malignant and benign tumors: (1) in multiple species, or at multiple tissue sites, or (2) by multiple routes of exposure, or (3) to an unusual degree with regard to incidence, site or type of tumor or age at onset; or 
There is less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans or laboratory animals, 
however; the agent, substance or mixture belongs to a well defined, structurally-related class of substances whose members are listed in a previous Report on Carcinogens as either a known to be human carcinogen, or reasonably anticipated to be human 
carcinogen  or there is convincing relevant information that the agent acts through 
mechanisms indicating it would likely cause cancer in humans. 
Conclusions regarding carcinogenicity in humans or experimental animals are based on scientific judgment, with consideration given to all relevant information.  Relevant information includes, but is not limited to dose response, route of exposure, chemical structure, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, sensitive sub populations, genetic effects, or other data relating to mechanism of action or factors that may be unique to a given substance.  For example, there may be substances for which there is evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory animals but there are compelling data indicating that the agent acts through mechanisms which do not operate in humans and would therefore not reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans.

Summary Statement 
Dyes Metabolized to 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine 
(3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine Dye Class) 
Carcinogenicity 
3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes that are metabolized to 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine are 
reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens  based on the fact that 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine 
is carcinogenic in male and female rats (IARC 1974; NTP 1990, 1998) and that metabolism of 
3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes to release free 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine is a generalized phenomenon, occurring in all species studied (Lynn et al. 1980; Bowman et al. 1982). Additional 
evidence of the carcinogenicity of this dye class is the fact that a representative 3,3'­dimethoxybenzidine-based dye, C.I. Direct Blue 15, is carcinogenic in male and female rats (NTP 1992). Further, the pattern of tumors observed with 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (NTP 1990) and C.I. Direct Blue 15 (NTP 1992) is similar to that observed with the structurally similar 
chemical 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine (NTP 1991a) and the 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine-based dye, C.I. 
Acid Red 114 (NTP 1991b). Most notably, each of these four chemicals induces increased 
incidences of tumors in skin, Zymbal gland, liver, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, preputial 
gland of male rats, and clitoral gland of female rats. 
No adequate human studies of the relationship between exposure to 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine­
based dyes and human cancer have been reported. 
Other Information Relating to Carcinogenesis or Possible Mechanisms of Carcinogenesis 
3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine is structurally similar to benzidine, a known human carcinogen (IARC 
1972, 1982, and 1987; NTP 1998) and 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine, which is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen (NTP 1998). Like benzidine and 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine, 3,3'­dimethoxybenzidine is used as a base chemical from which many dyes are synthesized. These dyes are synthesized by linking of various chromophores to the base chemicals via azo linkages. Regardless of the chromophore(s) involved, the azo linkages of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes are chemically equivalent and are readily cleaved by chemical or enzymatic reduction to form free 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine and the chromophore(s). Reductive cleavage of 3,3'­dimethoxybenzidine and similar dyes is catalyzed by a number of bacteria, including Escherichia 
coli, found in the human gastrointestinal tract (Cerniglia et al.  1982; Morgan et al. 1994). 
Reductive cleavage of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes to 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine also has been shown in studies with rats and dogs (Lynn et al.  1980; Bowman et al.  1983). By 
determining the quantities of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine and its metabolites excreted following administration of free 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine versus 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes, Lynn et al.  (1980) also provided quantitative evidence that each of the two dyes studied was 
nearly completely metabolized to free 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine. Metabolism of the dyes to free 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine in animals is thought to be mediated primarily by bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (Cerniglia et al.  1982; Morgan et al.  1994). 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine-based 
dyes are mutagenic in bacteria when tested with metabolic activation and an azo reductive 
iii  RoC Background Document for Dyes Metabolized to 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine 
preincubation protocol (NTP 1991a). It is assumed that the reductive system results in the 
formation of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, a known bacterial mutagen (Haworth et al.  1983). 
No information exists to suggest that the mechanism of carcinogenesis of these substances operating in laboratory animals would not also operate in humans.

 RoC Background Document for Dyes Metabolized to 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine 
1 Introduction 
Dyes metabolized to 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine dyes as a class) were 
nominated for listing in the Report on Carcinogens (RoC) by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) RoC Review Group (RG1) based on the current RoC listing of the parent compound 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (DMOB) as reasonably anticipated to 
be a human carcinogen  and the fact that the azo linkages of DMOB-based dyes are chemically 
equivalent and are readily cleaved by chemical or enzymatic reduction to form free DMOB and the chromophore(s). 
1.1 Chemical identification 
Dyes are a large and diverse group of organic compounds, many of them water-soluble, that have 
various applications for coloring numerous products. Dye molecules are colored because they are able to absorb and reflect light. Most dyes in use today are synthetic organic compounds. 
Dyes may be classified according to their chemical structures or their method of application. 
DMOB-based dyes contain DMOB attached to other substituents by diazo linkages. The dyes 
evaluated in this report are examples from the class of DMOB-based dyes that have been studied 
for their potentially carcinogenic properties. 
DMOB (C
14H16N2O2, mol wt 244.29, CASRN 119-90-4) is a methoxylated congener of 
benzidine and also is known by the following names:

1.2 Physical-chemical properties 
The chemical and physical properties of DMOB are summarized in Table 1-2. DMOB is a 
colorless, crystalline (sand-like) material that may turn violet upon standing. It is used as an intermediate in making dyes and is sensitive to heat, air, and, prolonged exposure to light (Radian 1991). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hazardous waste number for DMOB is U091, and its RTECS number is NIOSH/000875000. Table 1-3 summarizes the physical and chemical properties of some DMOB-based dyes (structures are shown in Table 1­1).

1.3 Identification of metabolites 
The metabolism of DMOB-based dyes to DMOB, in rats and dogs, results in appreciable levels 
of the free amine, monoacetyl metabolites, diacetyl metabolites, and alkaline hydrolyzable conjugates (AHCs) of metabolites (see Section 6). AHCs account for the major metabolite fraction, followed by appreciable amounts of diacetyl-DMOB and DMOB, with lesser amounts of monoacetyl-DMOB (Bowman et al. 1983).

2.1 Use 
The major use of DMOB is as an intermediate in the production of DMOB-based dyes used to 
color leather, paper, plastic, rubber, and textiles. It also is used as a chemical intermediate in the production of DMOB diisocyanate, used in isocyanate-based adhesive systems and as a component of polyurethane elastomers. DMOB also has been used in assays for metals, 
thiocyanates, and nitriles (NTP 1990; Radian 1991; Spectrum 1999). 
2.2 Production 
The United States International Trade Commission (U.S. ITC 1994) reported that DMOB was 
produced by two companies. DMOB-based dyes were produced by three companies. Current production volumes for individual producers are not reported because they are confidential for both importers and producers of DMOB. Table 2-1 summarizes past total production and import values for those DMOB-based dyes for which information is available. 
Table 2-1. Production and import values for DMOB-based dyes

Direct Blue dyes (including C.I. Direct Blue 
15 and 28) (production)     ~1280 (581 kg) 1993 U.S. ITC (1994) 
Direct Black dyes (including C.I. Direct Black 114) (production)   ~16750 (7,597 kg) 1993 U.S. ITC (1994) 
2.3 Analysis 
Following human exposure to DMOB-based dyes, urinary DMOB can be detected by hydrolysis 
of urinary metabolites and isolation of the free diamines through the use of a C 18 solid sorbent. 
DMOB is identified and quantified by monitoring of ultraviolet (UV) absorbance (at 280 or 245 
nm) and the electrochemical response. The limit of detection (LOD) for UV analysis is 0.9 µg/L, 
and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) is 3.1 µg/L. For electrochemical detection, the LOD is 0.16 
µg/L, while the LOQ is 0.70 µg/L. Recoveries range from 87% to 102% at 2- µg/L, 10-µg/L, and 
20-µg/L levels (Neumeister 1991). 
2.4 Environmental occurrence 
DMOB and DMOB-based dyes may be released into the environment as a result of their 
production and use. Approximately 99% of waste DMOB is deposited in water, 0.5% in terrestrial soil, and 0.5% in aquatic sediments (U.S. EPA 1988). From 1989 to 1996, four companies reported environmental releases of DMOB; no environmental releases of DMOB were reported for 1996. Seven companies reported releasing DMOB dihydrochloride into the environment, but only one had a release above the threshold reportable amount. A chemical

lb of DMOB dihydrochloride into the air. None of the DMOB-based dyes had entries in the Toxic Release Inventory database, because their releases were not subject to reporting under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (TRI 1996). 
2.5 Environmental fate 
Because no information is available about the long-term environmental fate of DMOB per se, 
environmental fate estimates are based on analogies with benzidine (HSDB 1991). 
2.5.1 Air 
Based upon the vapor pressure of DMOB (8.8 x 10-9 mm Hg at 25 ° C), it should remain almost 
entirely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. DMOB has an estimated half-life of 
two hours in the vapor phase of the atmosphere due, because it reacts with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. No information on photolysis is available; however, because DMOB can absorb light at wavelengths greater than 290 nm, this process may play a role in its degradation (HSDB 1991). 
C.I. Direct Blue 15 is an example of a DMOB-based dye that is expected to exist in the 
particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere, because its ionic state is essentially non-volatile. Particulate-phase C.I. Direct Blue 15 may be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition (HSDB 1996). No other atmospheric fate information was found for any of the other dyes metabolized to DMOB. 
2.5.2 Water 
DMOB is moderately persistent in water, with a half-life between 20 and 200 days (U.S. EPA 1988). DMOB released into water binds to humic material in the sediment. Biodegradation of DMOB is an important removal process in water, whereas hydrolysis is not. No information on evaporation was found. DMOB has a slight tendency to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms, with an estimated bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 13.9 (a BCF greater than 1,000 typically results in significant bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms) (HSDB 1991). 
For C.I. Direct Blue 15, the major aquatic fate is adsorption to sediment, which increases with 
decreasing pH. C.I. Direct Blue 15 is expected to be resistant to aerobic biodegradation. Complete anaerobic biodegradation of C.I. Direct Blue 15 by activated sludge inoculum was reported to take seven days. Volatilization of C.I. Direct Blue 15 from water surfaces is not expected to be an important process, as ionic compounds normally do not readily volatilize (HSDB 1996). No aquatic fate information was found for any of the other dyes metabolized to DMOB. 
2.5.3 Soil 
When DMOB is released into the soil, the amount of adsorption increases with decreasing pH. DMOB also will react with natural substances in the soil, such as clay minerals and Fe(III) as aromatic amines form covalent bonds with humic materials. DMOB was not shown to biodegrade in the MITI test, and only high levels of yeast extracts enhanced biodegradation (HSDB 1991).

C.I. Direct Blue 15 is retained by the ion-exchange process, particularly on clay surfaces, and by 
adsorption by mineral surfaces such as geothite, which slow or prevent leaching. Because of its ionic nature, C.I. Direct Blue 15 is expected to be resistant to aerobic biodegradation. Complete anaerobic biodegradation of C.I. Direct Blue 15 by activated sludge inoculum was reported to take seven days. Volatilization of C.I. Direct Blue 15 from the soil is not expected to be an important process (HSDB 1996). No terrestrial fate information was found for any of the other dyes metabolized to DMOB. 
2.6 Environmental exposure 
Most environmental exposures to DMOB and DMOB-based dyes are through contact with 
contaminated air, water, and soil (HSDB 1991). General population exposure also may occur via contact with paper, fabrics, and leather products containing these dyes and also as a result of consumer use of these dyes. 
2.7 Occupational exposure 
The primary modes of potential occupational exposure to DMOB and DMOB-based dyes are by 
inhalation or dermal contact. Most occupational exposures to DMOB occur in dye manufacturing and processing plants during the production of DMOB, during the use and processing of DMOB to make DMOB-based dyes, or during the application of DMOB-based dyes. In 1986 and 1987, the U.S. EPA, the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, and the Toxicological Association of the Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry conducted a joint survey to estimate airborne concentrations of dye dust in dye weighing rooms of plants where powdered dyes were used to dye and print textiles. While DMOB-based dyes were not specifically included in the survey, the results are considered to be representative of DMOB dye dust levels during weighing. The mean airborne concentration of total dye in the 24 plants randomly monitored was estimated to be 0.085 mg/m
3 (U.S. EPA 1990). Current production processes using DMOB and DMOB-dyes, 
however, generally are closed systems that minimize worker exposure (HSDB 1991). Occupational exposure also may occur in clinical laboratories through use of DMOB as a detecting reagent. 
The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) National Occupational 
Hazard Survey (NOHS) estimated that 204 workers potentially were exposed to DMOB from 1972 to 1974. The National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) found that 2,482 workers were exposed to DMOB from 1981 to 1983.  Table 2-2 summarizes the exposure data for DMOB and  DMOB-based dyes. NIOSH has not recommended any occupational exposure limits for DMOB or DMOB-based dyes.

2.8 Biological indices of exposure 
Exposure to DMOB and DMOB-based dyes can be detected in humans via analysis of urinary 
metabolites of DMOB (see Section 6.1). DMOB-based dyes are reductively cleaved to DMOB, which is further metabolized and excreted in urine and feces as the parent compound and a number of conjugates. Urine sampling and analysis is done to complement environmental monitoring in assessment of occupational exposure to these compounds. 
2.9 Regulations 
U.S. EPA regulates DMOB under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as a 
hazardous constituent of waste and under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). U.S. EPA also mandates that industrial releases of DMOB and DMOB dihydrochloride be reported by facilities under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). U.S. EPA regulates DMOB and DMOB dihydrochloride under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which requires submission of health and safety information. U.S. EPA also regulates C.I. Direct Blue 15 under TSCA. No regulations (U.S. EPA or FDA) were found for other DMOB-based dyes. The applicable U.S. EPA regulations are summarized in Table 2-3. 
OSHA regulates DMOB under the Hazard Communication Standard as a chemical hazard in 
laboratories. OSHA regulations are summarized in Table 2-4. No FDA regulations were found for DMOB.

3 Human Cancer Studies
 
3.1 Background 
DMOB-based dyes have not been evaluated in human cancer studies as single agents, and most 
of the epidemiological studies reviewed assessed DMOB in chemical mixtures with benzidine derivatives or other arylamines. Benzidine per se has been evaluated in a number of 
epidemiological studies. 
3.2 IARC reviews 
In IARC (1972), no human carcinogenicity data on DMOB were available. In a subsequent 
IARC evaluation (IARC 1987), DMOB was placed in Group 2B ( possibly carcinogenic to 
humans ). The human cancer data, however, was inadequate. IARC also evaluated C.I. Direct 
Blue 15, a dye that is metabolized to DMOB, in 1993. C.I. Direct Blue 15 was placed in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans ); there were no human carcinogenicity data for the dye 
(IARC 1993). 
Seven arylamines have been classified by IARC. Benzidine-based dyes and 4,4'-methylenebis(2­
chloroaniline) (MBOCA) were classified as probably carcinogenic , Group 2A, based on a high 
level of evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Two industrial chemicals (2­
naphthylamine and benzidine), one drug (Chlornaphazine), and two manufacturing processes (manufacture of auramine and magenta) were included in Group 1 on the basis of sufficient 
evidence of carcinogenicity in humans . IARC (1982) concluded that there was sufficient 
evidence that benzidine is carcinogenic to man. According to IARC (1987), case reports and follow-up studies of workers in many countries had demonstrated that occupational exposure to benzidine is causally associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer; thus benzidine was placed in Group 1 ( carcinogenic to humans ). 
3.3 Current studies (Table 3-1) 
In 1996, Ouellet-Hellstrom and Rench (1996) investigated cancer incidence in a cohort of 704 workers employed at a Connecticut chemical plant between 1965 and 1989. The plant produced a variety of chemicals, including arylamines such as dichlorobenzidine, DMOB, and 3,3'­dimethylbenzidine (DMB). The approximate production volume ratios between 1965 and 1989 were 9:4:1 for dichlorobenzidine, DMOB, and DMB, respectively. Benzidine production stopped before 1965, and only workers never exposed to benzidine at the plant were included in the study. The exposure classification system was developed by a panel of former and current employees based on work processes, potential exposures and job histories, and annual cumulative exposure scores ranging from 0 to 64.4 were calculated for each worker. Cancer cases were identified by three methods: the cohort roster was matched up with cancer cases in the Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR) through 1990; cancer cases were identified by reviewing death certificates of deceased workers if cancer was a cause or a contributing cause of death; and finally, a mail survey in 1993 was used to determine cancer cases in all members of the cohort who had mailing addresses (potential cases were confirmed by physicians). A total of 27 cancer cases were identified, 23 among male workers and 4 among female workers. Three of the 23 male cancer cases were non-melanoma skin cancers and were not considered in this study. For men, increased risks were found for cancer of the bladder, with a Standardized Incidence Ratio 
11  
 
 
 
   RoC Background Document for Dyes Metabolized to 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine 
(SIR) of 8.3 (95% CI 3.3 - 17.1) and cancer of the testis, with a SIR of 11.4, (95% CI 1.4 - 41.1). 
For women, breast cancer risk was increased (SIR 1.9, 95% CI 0.4 - 5.6). All bladder cancer cases were potentially exposed to arylamines. Testicular and breast cancer cases were in the non-exposed group. The observed association between bladder cancer and exposure to arylamines increased with increasing exposure (SIRs – 0, 5.5, and 16.4 for no, low, or moderate exposure). All bladder cancer cases were known to be current or former cigarette smokers. Thus, smoking may have contributed to the bladder cancer risk, but probably can’t entirely account for the eight­fold increase in risk (Ouellet-Hellstrom et al. 1996). 
3.4 Discussion 
Arylamines, including benzidine and 2-naphthylamine, have been demonstrated to be human carcinogens. Vineis and Pirastu (1997) reviewed cancer risk in humans resulting from occupational exposure to aromatic amines and tobacco smoking with reference to ecologic, cohort, and case-control studies. Occupational exposures to aromatic amines explain up to 25 percent of bladder cancers. Environmental tobacco smoke as well as occupation may contribute to exposure to aromatic amines.  Metabolic polymorphisms, such as the N-acetyltransferase genotype, play a modulating role in the risk of bladder cancer associated with exposure to aromatic amines. The consistent observation of a difference between men and women in bladder cancer risk may indicate gender differences in exposure or in biological determinants of cancer. The study by Ouellet-Hellstrom and Rench (1996) provides additional evidence that arylamine exposure is related to bladder cancer and suggests that DMOB exposure may constitute an important component of the exposure.  However, since only exposure to total arylamines was evaluated, the study does not directly implicate DMOB in cancer risk.

4 Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals
 
4.1 Carcinogenesis studies of DMOB 
4.1.1 Oral studies in rats 
Several studies of oral administration of DMOB to rats have been reported. In one study, 
30 mg of DMOB was administered via gavage in sunflower seed oil to 42 rats, three times a week for three weeks. The dose was reduced to 15 mg after three weeks because of poor survival. The dose of 15 mg was continued for 13 months. Of the18 rats surviving after 14 months, 2 had neoplasms of the Zymbal gland, 1 had a fibroadenoma of the mammary gland, and 1 had an ovarian neoplasm. None of the 50 rats in the control group developed tumors at these sites (Pliss 1963, 1965, cited in IARC 1974 and NTP 1990, 1992). 
In another study, male and female Fischer 344 rats (groups of 3 or 14 males and 3 or 15 
females) were administered 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, or 30 mg of DMOB per rat, five days a week for 52 weeks, followed by a six-month period of observation. A proprietary mixture composed of sodium chloride, sodium carboxymethylcellulose polysorbate 80, and benzyl alcohol in water was used as a vehicle in this study. No controls were reported in this study as cited. Incidences of total neoplasms were increased over those of the 360 pooled vehicle and untreated control rats (no statistical analysis was presented). Tumors were detected at various sites, including the urinary bladder (2 papillomas), mammary gland (3 carcinomas and 2 fibroadenomas), skin (5 carcinomas), intestinal tract (3 carcinomas), and Zymbal gland (8 carcinomas). Tumors appeared as early as day 293, but most were detected upon necropsy, 18 months after the initial DMOB administration (Hadidian et al. 1968, cited in IARC 1974 and NTP 1990, 1992). 
The carcinogenic potential of DMOB dihydrochloride was evaluated in a drinking-water study in rats of both sexes (NTP 1990). The study was scheduled for a 104-week duration, but was terminated early because of reduced survival of dosed animals attributable to DMOB-associated neoplasms. In this 21-month cancer bioassay, seven­week-old male and female Fischer 344/N rats received drinking water containing DMOB at concentrations of 0, 80, 170, or 330 ppm (corresponding to 0, 6, 12, or 21 mg/kg per day for males and 0, 7, 14, or 23 mg/kg per day for females). The sample sizes for both sexes were 60, 45, 75, and 60 for the control, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. Interim sacrifices of moribund animals or animals bearing large visible tumors were performed throughout the study. The study was terminated at 21 months, when all surviving animals were sacrificed. The tissues and organs of all sacrificed animals were histopathologically examined. 
Survival decreased markedly with increasing dosage. Among males, the number of rats 
surviving at study termination were 44 in the control group and 8 in the low-dose group. None of the male rats in the medium- and-high-dose groups survived the study duration. Among females, 45, 15, and 6 rats survived in the control, low-dose, and medium-dose groups, respectively, and none of the rats in the high-dose group survived.

Tumor incidences and their statistical significance in male and female rats are shown in 
Tables 4-1 and 4-2. Histopathological examination of the tissues revealed tumors at various sites, including benign and malignant tumors of the skin, Zymbal gland, preputial gland, clitoral gland, mammary gland, uterus, oral cavity, intestine, liver, and mesothelium. An observed increase in the incidence of astrocytomas of the brain may also have been treatment related.

The incidences of preputial gland and clitoral gland adenomas or carcinomas were significantly increased in the animals administered DMOB hydrochloride. The incidences of preputial and clitoral gland tumors were increased sevenfold and tenfold, respectively, over those in untreated historical controls. Also notable was the earlier appearance of carcinomas in the DMOB-dosed rats (32 weeks in males, 39 weeks in females) than in the controls (87 weeks in males). 
DMOB administration also caused significant dose-related increases in the incidences of 
Zymbal gland adenomas or carcinomas and skin neoplasms. Basal cell or sebaceous gland neoplasms were found in 72% of the DMOB-dosed males, compared with only 3% of the controls. The incidence of these neoplasms was lower in females, but their morphologic type was the same as detected in males; therefore, they were considered to be related to DMOB dihydrochloride exposure. Increased incidences of large and small intestine adenocarcinomas or adenomatous polyps (9% and 5% in high-dose males and females, respectively) also were observed. Large and small intestine adenocarcinomas or adenomatous polyps are rare in rats; none were observed in the 1,601 historical control animals in the National Toxicology Program (NTP) database. The increased incidence of intestinal tumors was considered to be related to DMOB dihydrochloride exposure (NTP 1990).

The NTP concluded that this study provided “clear evidence of carcinogenic activity” of 
DMOB hydrochloride in male and female Fischer 344/N rats under the conditions of this bioassay (NTP 1990). 
4.1.2 Oral studies in hamsters 
Groups of 30 male and 30 female Syrian golden hamsters were administered DMOB in the diet at concentrations of 0.1% or 1.0% (1,000 or 10,000 ppm) for 144 weeks. The number of controls was not specified in IARC (1974). The only malignant neoplasm observed was a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder in one animal after 144 weeks of exposure to DMOB at 1,000 ppm. This neoplasm is rare in hamsters and therefore was attributed to DMOB exposure. Forestomach papillomas were detected in 37% of the high-dose group, compared with 2% of the controls (Saffiotti et al. 1967, 
Sellakumar et al. 1969, both cited in IARC 1974). 
4.1.3 Drinking water studies in mice 
The carcinogenic potential of DMOB dihydrochloride  has been evaluated in a drinking-water study in mice of both sexes (Schieferstein et al. 1990). In this 112-week cancer 
bioassay, four-week-old BALB/cStCrlC3Hf/Nctr mice (166 male and 165 female) received drinking water containing DMOB dihydrochloride at 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, 315, or 630 ppm. The animals were scheduled to be sacrificed 13, 26, 39, 52, 78, or 112 weeks after initiation of the bioassay. The high dose level (630 ppm) given over a one-week period is approximately equal to an acute oral bolus dose that would be lethal to half of the animals, assuming that a 30-g mouse drinks 28 g of water per week. Water consumption was depressed in all the dose groups, especially the high-dose group. Although body weight gain was suppressed at the highest dose level during the first year, administration of DMOB dihydrochloride did not affect mortality of either males or females. No increased incidences of neoplasms were observed in any of the tissues examined, which included spleen, Harderian gland, liver, and lung (Schieferstein et al. 
1990). 
4.2 Carcinogenesis study of C.I. Direct Blue 15 
The carcinogenicity of C.I. Direct Blue 15, a DMOB-based dye, was evaluated in a 22­
month study in 40- to 47- day-old Fischer 344/N rats of both sexes (NTP 1992, IARC 1993). The concentrations of C.I. Direct Blue 15 in distilled drinking water were 0, 630, 
1250, or 2500 ppm (corresponding to 0, 45, 90, or 215 mg/kg per day for male rats and 0, 
50, 100, or 200 mg/kg per day for female rats). The numbers of male and female rats in the control, low-, medium-, and high-dose groups were 70, 45, 75, and 70, respectively. Ten animals from the control group and the high dose group were sacrificed at the nine-month interim evaluation. Ten additional animals from each group were sacrificed at the 15-month interim evaluation. 
The numbers of males surviving the duration of the study were 37 (75%), 8 (24%), 11 
(17%), and 2 (4%), respectively, from the 0-, 630-, 1250-, and 2500-ppm dose groups. The numbers of surviving females were 40 (80%), 13 (37%), 22 (35%), and 4 (8%) from the 0-, 630-, 1250-, and 2500-ppm dose groups. Administration of C.I. Direct Blue 15 significantly reduced the survival of both male and female rats. Reduced survival of

 RoC Background Document for Dyes Metabolized to 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine 
dosed animals was attributed to sacrifices of moribund animals necessitated by the 
appearance of treatment-related neoplasms. 
Post-necropsy, histopathological examination of the tissues of the male and female rats 
revealed benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal gland, preputial gland, clitoral gland, uterus, liver, oral cavity, and small and large intestine. Increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and neoplasms of the brain may also have been treatment-related. Increases in the incidences of Zymbal gland, oral cavity, and intestinal tumors were in the C.I. Direct Blue 15-treated rats were statistically significant and markedly dose-related. 
The incidences of squamous cell papillomas or carcinomas of the skin also were 
significantly increased. A similar increased incidence of basal cell adenomas or carcinomas of the skin was seen in high-dose males (56%, vs. 4% in controls), but not in females. Tumor incidences and their statistical significance are summarized in Table 4-3.

Based on the observations in this study, the NTP concluded that there was clear evidence 
of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Direct Blue 15 in male and female Fischer 344/N rats (NTP 1992). The IARC review of C.I. Direct Blue 15 concluded that it was possibly 
carcinogenic to humans  (Group 2B) (IARC 1993). 
4.3 Transplantability of preputial tumors induced by DMOB, a DMOB-based dye (C.I. Direct Blue 15), or a DMB-based bye (C.I. Acid Red 114) 
Ulland et al.  (1989) demonstrated the transplantability of preputial gland and epithelial 
skin neoplasms (epidermal basal cell tumors and epidermal squamous cell carcinomas) induced in Fischer 344/N rats during the lifetime drinking-water studies of DMOB, the DMOB-based dye, C.I. Direct Blue 15, or the DMB-based dye, C.I. Acid Red 114. The neoplasms selected for transformation studies were retrospectively diagnosed as malignant. Individual neoplasms were not associated with exposure to specific chemicals. Portions of the neoplasms were implanted into the left mammary fat pad of male Fischer 344/N rats. The rate of growth, presence of local invasion and distant metastases, and morphological features were observed following four serial transplants. All transplants were detected early, grew rapidly, and were histomorphologically similar to the original neoplasms. Metastases were observed with both preputial and skin tumor lines during the serial passages. These results confirmed the malignancy of the preputial gland and skin neoplasms. 
Transplantability also was demonstrated with preputial gland neoplasms induced in 
Fischer 344/N rats in drinking-water studies of DMOB (NTP 1990) and C.I. Direct Blue 
20  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  RoC Background Document for Dyes Metabolized to 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine 
15 (NTP 1992). The transplants were successful, and the transplanted neoplasms 
appeared to be malignant in nature, growing very rapidly (reaching 3.0 cm in 7 to 9 weeks) with a short latency period. The carcinomas were retrospectively diagnosed, but comparable information was not obtained for preputial gland adenomas. In four serial passages, the transplants did not become less differentiated or anaplastic; however, the transplants maintained their malignant nature despite their well-differentiated morphology. These results confirmed the malignancy of the preputial gland tumors induced by orally administered DMOB and C.I. Direct Blue 15. 
4.4 Oncogene activation induced by DMOB or C.I. Direct Blue 15 
A study designed to detect activation of ras oncogenes in rat tumors induced by DMOB 
or a DMOB-based dye explored the possibility that their carcinogenic mechanism in rats 
is the induction of activating point mutations in members of the ras gene family 
(Reynolds et al. 1990). Neoplasms obtained from control rats and rats exposed to DMOB 
or C.I. Direct Blue 15 were assayed for the presence of activated protooncogenes using the NIH 3T3 DNA mouse fibroblast transfection assay (Reynolds et al. 1990, NTP 1992). 
The assay detected activated oncogenes in 21/27 skin, clitoral gland, or preputial gland neoplasms that had been induced by C.I. Direct Blue 15. Activated ras oncogenes were 
detected at a higher frequency (11/13) in tissues of epidermal origin (skin) or histogenetically related tissues (clitoral and preputial gland, 10/14). In comparison, few activated of ras oncogenes were detected in spontaneous epithelial neoplasms (1/21) 
(Reynolds et al. 1990). The design and findings of this study are summarized in Tables 4­
4 and 4-5.

4.5 Tumorigenic activity of DMOB, DMB, and dyes based on DMOB and DMB 
The pattern of the increased tumor incidences observed with C.I. Direct Blue 15 was 
similar to that seen with DMOB and 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine (DMB), a structural analog 
of DMOB. Similar exposure to C.I. Acid Red 114, a dye based on DMB, also resulted in 
a similar pattern of tumors. A comparison of the tumorigenic response in rats for DMOB and DMOB-based dyes with DMB and DMB-based dyes is presented in Table 4-6. 
In addition, DMOB, DMB and dyes based on each of these compounds (C.I. Direct Blue 
15 and C.I. Acid Red 114, respectively) induced transplantable preputial gland and epithelial gland tumors in F344/N rats (Ulland et al. 1989). Activated ras oncogenes were 
also detected in DMOB- and C.I. Direct Blue 15-induced tumors at higher frequencies than those that arose spontaneously (Reynolds et al. 1990).

4.6 Summary 
Oral administration of DMOB is carcinogenic in rats and hamsters. The pattern of DMOB-induced tumors is similar to that seen with C.I. Direct Blue 15, a dye metabolized to DMOB. The one study of DMOB in mice failed to detect an increased incidence of tumors. The pattern of tumors induced by chronic administration of DMOB, a DMOB-based dye, DMB, and a DMB-based dye is strikingly similar. Such a similar pattern of tumors is taken as evidence of a common mechanism of action for these compounds, which is likely if the dyes are metabolized to the respective amines. DMOB, DMB, and a dye based on each of these compounds (C.I. Direct Blue 15 and C.I. Acid Red 114, respectively) induce transplantable preputial gland and epithelial gland tumors in Fischer 344/N rats. In addition, activated ras oncogenes are detected in tumors induced by 
DMOB or C.I. Direct Blue 15 at higher frequencies than in spontaneously occurring tumors.

5 Genotoxicity 
5.1 Prokaryotic systems 
5.1.1 Induction of mutation in Salmonella typhimurium 
DMOB has been extensively studied for the induction of gene mutations in Salmonella 
typhimurium. In tests sponsored by the NTP (1992), DMOB dissolved in 
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was tested at multiple concentrations (0 to 10,000 µg/plate) 
in three different laboratories, in various S. typhimurium  strains with and without 
metabolic activation by S9 liver homogenate from Aroclor-induced rats and hamsters. 
Overall, DMOB was mutagenic with exogenous metabolic activation in strains TA98 and TA100 (Haworth et al. 1983; NTP 1992). One laboratory reported a significant response 
in strain TA98 without metabolic activation, and another laboratory observed a weakly positive response in strain TA1535 in the presence of hamster S9 liver homogenate. 
Another study tested the mutagenic response of various S. typhimurium  strains (with and 
without S9 liver homogenate from Aroclor-induced rats or hamsters) to DMOB and the 
corresponding N-monoacetyl and N,N
′-diacetyl derivatives. In general, TA98 was the 
most sensitive strain, followed by TA1538; all three compounds were mutagenic in these 
strains. DMOB was more mutagenic in the presence of S9 liver homogenate from rats than with S9 from hamsters. The N-monoacetylated derivative was more mutagenic than 
DMOB or the N,N
′-diacetyl derivative (Reid  et al . 1984, cited in Morgan et al. 1994). 
The mutagenic activity of DMOB and DMOB dihydrochloride was tested in S. 
typhimurium  strains TA100 and TA98 with and without rat S9 metabolic activation, at 
concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 µg/mol. Both the free base and dihydrochloride salt 
forms of DMOB were mutagenic with metabolic activation, and no appreciable difference in mutagenic activity between the two forms was observed (Messerly et al. 
1987). 
In another gene mutation assay, DMOB at concentrations of 5, 50, or 100 µg/plate was 
mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA1538 with S9 metabolic activation 
(Sariaslani and Stahl 1990). Other studies have confirmed that DMOB is mutagenic in 
strain TA98 with metabolic activation and reported a weak mutagenic response in strain TA100 with activation (You et al. 1993). 
A number of dyes metabolized to DMOB (C.I. Direct Blue 1, C.I. Direct Blue 8, C.I. Direct Blue 10, C.I. Direct Blue 15, and C.I. Direct Violet 32) are not mutagenic in the absence of conditions that result in the reduction by azo bonds. However, all DMOB-based dyes tested in an azo-reductive system (rat cecal flora mix or flavin mononucleotide [FMN]) were found mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strains TA98 or 
TA1538 (Morgan et al. 1994). The results of this study are summarized in Table 5-1.

C.I. Direct Blue 15, a dye that is metabolized to DMOB, yields DMOB upon metabolic 
reduction of the azo bonds and is thus considered potentially genotoxic (Ashby and Tennant 1988; Mortelmans et al. 1986, both cited in NTP 1992). In the NTP study (NTP 
1992), C.I. Direct Blue 15 was not mutagenic in various S. typhimurium  strains (with or 
without rat or hamster liver S9 metabolic activation) at various concentrations (100 to 
10,000 µg/plate). However, when tested after reductive (rat cecal bacteria or FMN) 
metabolism, it was mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strain TA1538 with S9 activation at 
concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, or 1.00 µM (NTP 1992). Other studies have confirmed that 
C.I. Direct Blue 15 is mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strains TA98, TA100, and TA1538 
when reductive metabolism precedes incubation (Gregory et al. 1981; Brown and 
Dietrich 1983; Prival et al. 1984; Reid et al. 1984, all cited in NTP 1992). 
C.I. Direct Blue 15 was found to be mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strain TA98 and the 
arabinose-resistant tester strain SV50 in the presence of hamster or rat liver S9 metabolic 
activation. The concentrations tested ranged from 0.10 to 3.00 mg/plate. SV50 was less sensitive than TA98 in detecting mutagenic response (Krishna et al. 1986). In this study, 
DMOB was non-mutagenic in the arabinose-resistant tester strain SV50 and mutagenic in 
S. typhimurium  strain TA98. 
5.1.2 Mutagenicity in Escherichia coli 
DMOB failed to induce DNA damage in Escherichia coli  in the absence of S9 metabolic 
activation (Fluck et al.  1976, cited in NTP 1990). 
5.2 Eukaryotic systems 
5.2.1 Mutagenicity in Drosophila melanogaster 
DMOB did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in adult male Drosophila 
melanogaster  administered DMOB in feed at 100 ppm or by injection at 200 ppm (Yoon 
et al. 1985, cited in NTP 1990).

5.3 Mammalian systems 
5.3.1 In vitro assays 
5.3.1.1 Mouse lymphoma cell mutagenesis assay 
In two NTP-sponsored studies (Caspary et al. 1988), DMOB dihydrochloride was 
mutagentic in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell mutagenesis assay both with and 
without metabolic activation by S9 liver homogenate from Fischer 344 rats. 
In the first study (Myhr and Caspary 1988), the assays were conducted with no 
exogenous activation and with activation by S9 liver homogenate from non-induced Fischer 344/N rats. DMOB was mutagenic under non-activation conditions over a narrow 
concentration range (60 to 90 µg/mL) just below the toxic concentration ( ≥ 90 µg/mL). 
Addition of S9 caused a reduction in toxicity. A two-fold increase in mutation frequency 
was observed at 75 µg/mL. At 250 µg/mL (which exceeded the apparent solubility limit), 
the mutation frequency increase ranged from 1.6- to 2.2-fold. Insoluble doses of 300 
µg/mL induced a three-fold increase in mutation frequency. The primary effect of 
addition of S9 was to reduce the toxicity of DMOB dihydrochloride without changing the 
magnitude of the mutagenic activity at toxic doses (Myhr and Caspary 1988). 
In the second study (Mitchell et al.  1988), the mouse lymphoma assay was conducted 
with and without S9 liver homogenate from Aroclor-induced Fischer 344 rats. DMOB 
dihydrochloride was mutagenic in the absence of S9, inducing a three- to four-fold 
mutation frequency increase at concentrations of 64 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL. In the 
presence of S9, the toxicity was reduced, and concentration ranges were approximately 
five times as high. A twofold increase in mutation frequency was observed at 
concentrations of 328 µg/mL and 437 µg/mL. 
5.3.1.2 Chromosomal aberrations (CA) 
DMOB dihydrochloride induces CA in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with and 
without metabolic activation (Galloway et al. 1987, cited in NTP 1990). When first 
reported, the results of the CA tests were considered negative, but later statistical reanalysis of the data indicated that the results were weakly positive without S9 metabolic activation and positive with S9 activation (Galloway et al. 1985, 1987, cited in 
NTP 1990). Concentrations ranged from 0.005 to 5000 µg/mL. 
The DMOB-based dye C.I. Direct Blue 15 failed to induce CA in CHO cells. 
Concentration ranges for this assay were 1500 to 2250 µg/mL without metabolic 
activation and 2000 to 2500 µg/mL with metabolic activation. Reductive metabolism was 
not used in the chromosomal aberrations assay (NTP 1992). 
5.3.1.3 Sister chromatid exchanges 
DMOB dihydrochloride induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in CHO cells both 
with and without S9 metabolic activation. Concentrations ranged from 0.005 to 5000 
µg/mL. In one of the two laboratories conducting these cytogenetic tests, the weakly 
positive SCE result without S9 activation occurred under delayed harvest (3 to 5 hours), 
because DMOB dihydrochloride induced a delay in the cell division cycle. The positive 
27  
 
 
 
 RoC Background Document for Dyes Metabolized to 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine 
results obtained by the other laboratory occurred at lower concentrations of DMOB 
dihydrochloride that did not affect cell cycle time (Galloway et al. 1985, cited in NTP 
1990). 
C.I. Direct Blue 15 did not induce SCEs in CHO cells. Concentrations ranged from 250 
to 750 µg/mL without metabolic activation and 83.3 to 2500 µg/mL with metabolic 
activation. A 20% increase in SCEs per chromosome of culture would have been 
classified as a positive result. Reductive metabolism was not used in this assay (NTP 1992). 
5.3.2 In vivo  assays 
5.3.2.1 Chromosomal aberrations 
A single 100-mg/kg dose of DMOB was injected into four mice. DMSO (2 mL/kg) was used as a negative control, and 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene (DMBA) (100 mg/kg) 
was a positive control. DMOB caused a statistically significant increase in CA in the bone marrow of mice relative to DMSO controls (aberrant cells = 5.25 +  0.96%, mitotic 
indices = 2.05 +  0.15%). DMOB was not, however, nearly as genotoxic as the positive 
control, DMBA (You et al. 1993). 
5.4 Summary 
DMOB is mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  with exogenous metabolic activation. 
C.I. Direct Blue 15, a DMOB-based dye, also is mutagenic in S. typhimurium  with 
metabolic activation and in the presence of azo-reductive systems that form DMOB. DMOB induces mutations in the mouse lymphoma cell assay and causes CA and SCE in CHO cells, in the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation. DMOB also induces chromosomal aberrations in vivo  in the bone marrow of mice.

6 Other Relevant Data 
6.1	 Mammalian absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of DMOB 
and DMOB-based dyes 
In a study of DMOB-based dye absorption, metabolism, and excretion, five female mongrel dogs received single oral doses of 100 mg/kg of C.I. Direct Blue 15 or C.I. Direct Blue 1. Free DMOB, as an impurity in each dye sample, was determined. The urinary excretion of free DMOB also was monitored using gas chromatography. C.I. Direct Blue 15 and C.I. Direct Blue 1 were metabolized to DMOB as indicated by the presence of more amine in the urine than could be accounted for by the presence of free DMOB as an impurity in the dye sample. This is an indication that C.I. Direct Blue 15 and C.I. Direct Blue 1 undergo azo reduction to yield the parent amine, DMOB. There was substantial variation in the percentage of the dose of the dyes excreted as free DMOB. The results of this study are summarized in Table 6-1 (Lynn et al. 1980).

In a similar study, C.I. Direct Blue 15 and C.I. Direct Blue 1 were administered by 
gavage (100 mg/kg) to male Sprague-Dawley rats to study the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of the dyes in rats (Lynn et al.  1980). The free DMOB impurity in the C.I. 
Direct Blue 15 and C.I. Direct Blue 1 samples were measured as 1 and <1 µg, 
respectively. DMOB was excreted in the urine of the rats at concentrations of 13.0 ± 12.9 
and 42.5 ± 27.7 µg, respectively, 72 hours after administration of C.I. Direct Blue 15 and 
C.I. Direct Blue 1. These urinary concentration levels of free DMOB correspond to 0.17 
± 0.18 and 0.55 ± 0.37 percent, respectively, of the potential theoretical maximum 
produced by complete reduction of the azo bonds of the administered C.I. Direct Blue 15 
and C.I. Direct Blue 1 doses. In comparison, the free DMOB was eliminated in the urine of rats in higher concentrations than in the urine of dogs from the same doses of C.I. Direct Blue 15 and C.I. Direct Blue 1. More detailed results from these urinary excretion studies of benzidine-, DMB-, and DMOB-based dyes in rats and dogs are presented in Appendix C (Tables C-1 and C-2).

DMOB-based dyes, including C.I. Direct Blue 15, have been reported to be metabolized to DMOB in 
humans as indicated by the detection of DMOB in the urine of three of 22 workers who dried and ground 
two DMOB-based dyes (NIOSH 1981; Rodgers et al.  1983, cited in NTP 1992). Azo dyes containing 
DMOB can also be reduced by rat liver azoreductases to DMOB (Martin and Kennelly 1981, cited in NTP 
1992). 
Bowman et al. (1982) demonstrated the metabolism of C.I. Direct Blue 15, a DMOB-
based dye, in male Fischer 344 rats. In this study, the biphenyl portion of the molecule 
was uniformly labeled.. Approximately 18.8% of the [14C] administered was recovered in 
the urine of the rats given C.I. Direct Blue 15 (12 mg dye/kg body weight or molar equivalent DMOB by oral gavage). Intact dye in the feces accounted for 12% of the orally administered dose, with 84% of the fecal [
14C] resulting from unidentified 
metabolic products. In comparison, when rats were administered 14C-labeled DMOB, 
35% and 74.4% of the [14C] was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. The 
excretion of [14C] in the feces and urine peaked at 8 to 16 hours after dosage, although 
detectable amounts of [14C] were still being excreted 144 to 192 hours after the single 
oral dose of 12 mg/kg of the 14C-labeled dye . Analysis of urinary metabolites after oral 
administration of C.I. Direct Blue 15 revealed that radioactivity was excreted in a free amine fraction and in an alkaline hydrolyzable conjugate (AHC) fraction. The free amine fraction was comprised of DMOB (0.22% of the dose), its monoacetylated metabolite (0.27%), and its diacetylated metabolite (0.22%). The AHC fraction contained DMOB (0.48% of the dose). DMOB is more extensively metabolized and excreted than the dye. Diacetylated DMOB was the major metabolite observed following administration of DMOB-based dyes. Following administration of DMOB, most of the dose found in urine was in the AHC fraction (1.56%). Other compounds found in urine were DMOB (1.18%), monoacetylated-DMOB (0.35%), and diacetylated-DMOB (0.93%). 
After oral administration of 
14C-labeled C.I. Direct Blue 15 to rats, [14C] concentration 
was initially high in the gastrointestinal tract, with subsequent time-related, widespread 
distribution of radioactivity to soft tissues. 
In further experimentation, Bowman et al.  (1983) demonstrated the metabolism of 
several DMOB-based dyes (C.I. Direct Blue 8, C.I. Direct Blue 10, C.I. Direct Violet 32, 
or C.I. Direct Black 114). In this study, urinary excretion of DMOB and its metabolites was observed in the urine of male Fischer 344 rats up to 96 hours after the oral administration of a single dose of 2 mg of C.I. Direct Blue 8, C.I. Direct Blue 10, C.I. Direct Violet 32, or C.I. Direct Black 114. Sensitive chromatographic analysis (EC/GC) of metabolites in the urine revealed mainly mono- and di-acetylated-DMOB, the parent amine (DMOB), and alkaline hydrolyzable conjugates in concentrations ranging from 15 
µg (for alkaline hydrolyzable conjugates derived from C.I. Direct Violet 32) to 0.07 µg 
(for mono-acetylated DMOB derived from C.I. Direct Blue 8) at the peak excretion 
period of 12 to 24 hours post-treatment. At the peak excretion period of 12 to 24 hours 
post-treatment, a total DMOB µg-equivalent of 4.9, 12, 11, and 27 were excreted for C.I. 
Direct Blue 8, C.I. Direct Black 114, C.I. Direct Blue 10, C.I. Direct Violet 32 doses, 
respectively. Excretion was essentially complete within 96 hours. 
Rodgers et al.  (1983, cited in NTP 1990) investigated the metabolism of 
14C-labeled 
DMOB administered intravenously to male Fischer 344 rats. Thirty minutes after dosing,

less than 2% of unchanged 14C-labeled DMOB was recovered. Within 72 hours, 70% of 
the total 14C-labeled dye administered was excreted in the bile. In intact rats, 50% of the 
dose was found in the intestinal tract after 2 hours. After either oral or intravenous 
administration, 50% of the dose was excreted in feces and 30 to 40% in urine within three days. Of the [
14C] remaining in the animal, 45% was present in the liver in the form of 
covalently bound metabolites; more than 90% of the urinary radiolabel was in the form of metabolites. Unmetabolized DMOB accounted for 3 to 9% of the dose, and less than 5% was associated with acetyl-DMOB. The proposed metabolic pathway is shown in Figure 6-1. 
6.2 Bacterial metabolism of DMOB-based dyes 
The
 reductive metabolism of DMOB-based dyes (illustrated in Figure 6-2) results in the 
formation of DMOB. Azo reduction can result from the enzymes present in the liver or 
azo reductase associated with intestinal bacterial flora. Reductive cleavage of dyes metabolized to DMOB may occur, primarily, through the activity of intestinal bacteria (Martin and Kennelly 1981; Cerniglia et al. 1982; Brown and Dietrich 1983; Bos et al. 
1984, 1986, all cited in NTP 1990). The free DMOB is then absorbed, resulting in systemic exposure, further metabolism (probably in the liver), and subsequent excretion.

Cer
niglia et al. (1982) assessed the abilities of pure cultures of a variety of anaerobic 
bacteria to reduce the azo linkages in C.I. Direct Blue 15, a DMOB-based dye. This study 
also investigated the ability of bacterial suspensions from the intestinal contents of rats to carry out the reductive cleavage. Both pure cultures of anaerobes and cultures isolated from rat intestinal contents carried out the reductive cleavage. The known organisms (see Table 6-2) varied in the rates at which they reduced C.I. Direct Blue15.

The bacterial isolate from rat intestine was highly efficient in reducing C.I. Direct Blue 
15 to DMOB. C.I. Direct Blue 15 (188 nmol) was added to an incubation medium containing 10
10 bacterial cells. The mixture was assayed for DMOB and C.I. Direct Blue 
15 up to 48 hours. Production of DMOB began promptly and was essentially complete (as evidenced by the absence of C.I. Direct Blue 15) within 4 hours. 
6.3 Protein adduction 
The covalent binding of orally administered DMOB to hemoglobin was studied in female 
Wistar rats. The results indicated two cleavage products, with amounts of DMOB in excess of or comparable to amounts of the monoacetyl derivative. The hemoglobin

 RoC Background Document for Dyes Metabolized to 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine 
binding index for DMOB was estimated as 2.7 (24.3 for benzidine) (Birner et al.  1990). 
This indicates a potential for binding of these residues to biological macromolecules. 
6.4 Summary 
The results of a number of studies of the metabolism and elimination of DMOB-based 
dyes provide evidence that these dyes are subject to in vivo metabolism giving rise to the 
parent amine. The metabolism of DMOB proceeds through N-acetylation and excretion in 
both urine and feces. Because the intact dye molecules are not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, the initial metabolic step, azo reduction, most likely takes place in the gastrointestinal tract. Azo reduction of orally administered chemicals can be mediated by the microflora of the intestinal tract, which contains a variety of anaerobic species. An assessment of the anaerobic metabolism of DMOB-derived dyes supports this hypothesis. Results indicate that the metabolic conversion of bisazobiphenyl dyes, based on benzidine, DMB and DMOB, to carcinogenic aromatic amines is a general phenomenon and therefore, with few exceptions, should be anticipated for each member of this class of chemicals.

Carcinogenicity 
There is sufficient evidence for lthe carcinogenicity of 3,3'­
dimethoxybenzidine in experimen~l animals (!ARC V.4, 1974; 
!ARC S.4, 1982). When administered by gavage, 3,3'­
dimethoxybenzidine induced tumlors at various sites including 
Zym hal gland tumors, intestinal ~arcinom as, skin carcinomas, 
and urinary bladder papillomas in rats of both sexes. When 
administered in the diet, 3,3' -dim thoxybenzidine increased the 
incidence of forestomach papillomas. When administered in the 
drinking water, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride 
increased the incidence of Zymbal gland adenomas and 
carcinomas, liver neoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas, 
large intestine adenomatous polfPs or adenocarcinomas, and 
squamous cell papillomas or carci[jomas of the oral cavity in rats 
of both sexes; preputial gland carci1omas, basal cell adenomas and 
carcinomas of the skin, adenocar inomas of the small intestine, 
and mesotheliomas in male rats; a d clitoral gland adenomas and 
carcinomas, basal cell adenoma~ or carcinomas of the skin, 
mammary gland adenocarcinomas, and uterus/cervix adenomas or 
carcinomas in female rats (NTP 37:2, 1990). 
An !ARC Working Group reported that there is inadequate 
evidence for the carcinogenicity of 3,3' -dimethoxybenzidine in 
humans. No epidemiological data ;on the occurrence of cancer in 
workers exposed to 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine alone appear in the 
literature. Most of the workers exposed to this substance were also 
exposed to related amines," such a$ benzidine, which are strongly 
asso~iated with urinary bladder career in humans (see Benzidine, 
Secnon liLA) (IARC, V.4, 1974
1 IARC S.4, 1982; IARC S.7, , 
1987). 
Properties 
3.3'-Dimethoxybenzidine occurs as colorless crystals which turn 
violet upon standing. It is virtually insoluble in water and 
probably soluble in most organi4 solvents (e.g., ethanol, ether, 
acetone, benzene, and chlorofor~). 3,3'-D imethoxybenzidine is 
available commercially as the free ase (technical and 99% grades) 
and as its dihydrochloride salt. hen heated to decom position, 
3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine emits ~oxic fumes of nitrogen oxides 
(NO,). 
Use 
3,3 '-D imethoxybenzidine is Ufed principally as a chemical 
intermediate for the production of azo dyes. The Society of Dyers 
and Colourists reported its u$e as an intermediate in the 
production of 89 dyes in 1971. Among the dyes listed were 
Direct Blue 218, Pigment Orang~ 16, Direct Blue 1, Direct Blue 
15, Direct Blue 8, Direct Blue 76, and Direct Blue 98. About 
30% of rhe 3,3'-dimethoxybe~zidine consumed is used as a 
chemical intermediate to produc~ o-dianisidine diisocyanate for 
use in adhesive systems and as ~'a component of polyurethane 
elastomers and resins. 3,3'-Dime hoxybenzidine is used as a dye 
for leather, paper, plastics, rubbe , and textiles, and a reagent to 
detect metals, thiocyanates, and nmites (IARC V.4, 1974). Production 
The Chem Sources USA directory did not identify any producers 
of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine in 1986, but listed 13 suppliers 
(Chem Sources, 1986). No other current production data were 
available. U.S. imports of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine were reported 
by the USITC to be 106,000 lb and imports of 3,3'­
dimethoxybenzidine and its dihydrochloride were reported to be 
655,000 lb in 1983 (USITCa, 1984). The 1979 TSCA Inventory 
identified two companies producing an unspecified amount of 
3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine and six companies importing 55.500 lb 
in 1977. The CBI Aggregate was less than I million lb (TSCA 
1979). U.S. imports of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine through the 
principal custom districts wer~ reported to be 273,000 lb in 1971. 
Data on domestic production of 3.3'-dimethoxybenzidine were 
last reported in 1967, when five companies produced 368,000 lb; 
3.3'-dimethoxybenzidine has been produced commercially for at 
least 50 years (IARC V.4, 1974). 
Exposure 
The primary routes of potential human exposure to 3,3'­
dimethoxybenzidine are inhalation and dermal contact. Exposure 
to 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine can occur during its use as a chemical 
intermediate in the production of azo dyes, o-dianisidine 
diisocyanate formulations, textile processing, and packaging 
processes. Workers potentially exposed to the chemical include 
dye makers and o-dianisidine diisocyanate production workers. 
However, present dye production processes for 3,3'­
dimethoxybenzidine and its dye derivatives are generally closed 
systems with minimal risk to workers. TheN ational Occupational 
Hazard Survey, conducted by NIOSH from 1972 to 1974, 
estimated that 200 workers were possibly exposed to 3,3'­
dimethoxybenzidine in the workplace (NIOSH, 1976). Potential 
human exposure may occur as a result of the presence of trace 
contaminants in end products that are formulated with 3,3'­
dimethoxybenzidine (e.g., azo dyes, pigments, adhesives, resins, 
and polyurethane elastomers). CPSC is concerned that these dyes 
and pigments contain residual levels or trace impurities of 3,3'­
dimcthoxybenzidine in the ppm range and that traces may be 
present in the final consumer products. Presently, no data are 
available on the actual quantities in the final consumer products. 
A dermal penetration study in rabbits indicated that a 3,3'­
dimethoxybenzidine-based dye was not dermally absorbed in 
significant amounts. 
Regulations 
In late 1980, CPSC started collecting data to propose a ban on 
the use of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes in mass­
merchandised consumer dye products; however, the use of 
benzidine congener dyes in consumer household dyeing products 
and in com mercia( textile applications has been decreased 
voluntarily. Artists and crafts people have been alerted to potential 
hazards from inhaling powders of dyes based on 3,3'­
dim ethoxybenzidine. EPA regulates 3 ,3' -dim ethoxybenzidine 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and Superfund 
Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). An adjustment of 
the statutory reportable quantity (RQ) from 1 lb to 100 lb has 
been established for this chemical under CERCLA. RCRA 
regulates 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine as a hazardous constituent of 
waste. EPA has included 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine on a list of 
F-1 priority Iazard substances under S_ARA. OSHA regulates 3,3'­
dimethoxybenz.idine and its dihydrochloride salt under the 
Hazard Communication Standard and as chemical hazards in 
laboratories.
