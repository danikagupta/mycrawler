Abstract: Effects of bioaugmentation of the composite microbial culture CES-1 on a full scale textile
dye wastewater treatment process were investigated in terms of water quality, sludge reduction,
dynamics of microbial community structures and their functional genes responsible for degradation
of azo dye, and other chemicals. The removal efﬁciencies for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD),
Total Nitrogen (T-N), Total Phosphorus (T-P), Suspended Solids (SS), and color intensity (96.4%, 78.4,
83.1, 84.4, and 92.0, respectively) 300–531 days after the augmentation were generally improved
after bioaugmentation. The denitriﬁcation linked to T-N removal appeared to contribute to the
concomitant COD removal that triggered a reduction of sludge (up to 22%) in the same period of
augmentation. Azo dye and aromatic compound degradation and other downstream pathways
were highly metabolically interrelated. Augmentation of CES-1 increased microbial diversity in the
later stages of augmentation when a strong microbial community selection of Acinetobacter parvus ,
Acinetobacter johnsonii ,Marinobacter manganoxydans ,Verminephrobacter sp., and Arcobacter sp. occurred.
Herein, there might be a possibility that the CES-1 augmentation could facilitate the indigenous
microbial community successions so that the selected communities made the augmentation successful.
The metagenomic analysis turned out to be a reasonable and powerful tool to provide with new
insights and useful biomarkers for the complex environmental conditions, such as the full scale dye
wastewater treatment system undergoing bioaugmentation.

1. Introduction
Azo dyes are one of the oldest synthetic chemicals and are still widely used in textile
printing and the food industries. The annual production worldwide is approximately
700,000 tons, about 10%–15% of which are released into the environment during manufac-
turing and usage [ 1]. The textile industry is considered one of the largest water consumers
in the world. It is rapidly expanding, and dyes are also continuously being upgraded and
replaced by superior compounds that have enhanced fastness, stability, brightness, and
resistance to natural degradation. Color is the ﬁrst contaminant to be recognized in the
wastewater and has to be removed before discharging into water bodies or on land [ 2]. The
presence of very small amounts of dyes in water (less than 1 ppm for some dyes) is highly
visible and affects the aesthetic merit, water transparency, and gas solubility in lakes, rivers,
and other water bodies [ 3]. It is noteworthy that some dyes are highly toxic and mutagenic,

and decrease light penetration and photosynthetic activity, causing oxygen deﬁciency and
limiting downstream beneﬁcial uses such as recreation, drinking water, and irrigation [4].
It has been shown that azo and nitro-compounds are reduced in sediments [ 5] and in
the intestinal environment [ 6], resulting in the regeneration of the parent toxic amines [ 3].
Azo dyes and some of their N-substituted aromatic biodegradation products are toxic
and/or carcinogenic and, hence, the dyes need to be treated as important environmental
pollutants [ 7]. Bacterial azo dye biodegradation typically occurs in two steps. The ﬁrst
step involves a reductive cleavage of the dyes’ azo linkages, resulting in the generation
of generally colorless but potentially toxic aromatic amines. The second one involves the
degradation of the aromatic amines. Azo dye reduction usually happens under anaer-
obic conditions, while bacterial biodegradation of aromatic amines is mostly an aerobic
process [ 8]. Bacteria can even degrade intermediate products of decolorization such as
aromatic amines with the help of enzymes like hydroxylase and oxygenase [ 9], thus aiding
in reducing lethal effects of azo dyes by the formation of non-toxic metabolites. These
indicate the importance of a proper combination of anaerobic and aerobic bacterial com-
munities in the azo dye treatment system. Moreover, it would be necessary to develop
microbial consortia that harbor genes for the efﬁcient degradation of mixtures of azo dyes
and aromatic amines. The consortia will be quite useful for the bioaugmentation of the
azo dye wastewater treatment system. The decolorization and COD removal of the azo
dye wastewater in an anaerobic reactor packed with a pair of Fe-graphite plate electrodes
were signiﬁcantly higher than in a single anaerobic reactor and a single electrode reactor
because of microbial richness and diversity stimulated by the electrochemical reaction on
the electrodes [ 10]. Bioaugmentation of the microbial consortium SFC 500-1 showed a
great potential for the treatment of tannery efﬂuents under laboratory and ﬁeld microcosm
systems [ 11]. A mutualistic-symbiotic relationship between bioaugmented bacteria and
soil indigenous microbes facilitated an enhanced detoxiﬁcation of mixed dyes, leading to a
sustainable approach for restoration of contaminated lands [ 12]. The bioaugmentation of
hydrolysis acidiﬁcation (HA) by a halophilic bacterial consortium facilitated an increase of
bacterial diversity and dominant invasion of Marinobacterium which played a key role in azo
dye decolorization [ 13]. An imperfect color removal with standard activated sludge system
is related to changes in concentration and composition of dyes, and their toxicity, as well
as sludge adaptation to such unstable conditions. Therefore, there is still a growing need
in ﬁnding an effective and low-cost method for the removal of dyes from wastewater [ 4].
Industrial-scale studies for bioaugmentation have been applied to the target pollutants,
including ammonia and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [14].
Metagenomic analysis by using high-throughput sequencing methods may help to
overcome the limitations of conventional methods of studying microbial community dy-
namics in the dye wastewater treatment process. The high-throughput sequencing analysis
approach will provide a great opportunity and new insights to reveal the composition
of microbial communities, diversity of functional genes, and enzymes responsible for
the treatment of various wastewaters including tannery and textile wastewaters. There
should be more studies for a better understanding of the degradation pathways where
bioaugmentation is implemented. It will be also necessary to undertake bioaugmentation
efﬁcacy studies at full scale with test and control streams and evaluation of the economic
viability of the technique [ 14]. Researchers have concentrated on designing numerous
technologies [ 15] for the treatment of textile wastewater and also studied the changes in
microbial community and diversity in the treatment systems. [ 16]. However, there have
been no studies on high-throughput detection of microbial community proﬁles of environ-
mental samples such as dye wastewater which have been severely affected by long-term
exposure to improper discharge. Guo et al. (2013) and Krishnamoorthy et al. (2021) [ 17,18]
used a metagenomic approach to unravel the community diversity and functional pro-
ﬁles within activated sludge from a full-scale SNPR WWTP and found that various key
enzymes involved in metabolisms degrading various chemicals could be annotated in
different treatments. However, it was hard to distinguish the effects of each divergentMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 3 of 19
variable on microbial community in a full-scale dye wastewater treatment plant since
a lot of uncontrollable or even undetectable inﬂuential factors were involved in such a
pollutant-removing process [ 19]. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate adverse effects on the
enzyme functions, variation on the microbial community structures and activities of the
activated sludge under controllable processing conditions.
In this study, a full-scale dye wastewater treatment process was monitored and evalu-
ated in terms of physicochemical parameters, sludge reduction, functional genes encoding
enzymes responsible for degradation of various chemicals, as well as azo dyes and micro-
bial community structures before and after bioaugmentation of the composite microbial
culture CES-1 over more than 500 days. The intrinsic relationships among metabolic func-
tional genes, the microbial community structures, and samples of different treatment stages
and times were comprehensibly analyzed based on the metagenomic analysis technology.
The obtained data appeared to successfully reveal a mechanistic basis of beneﬁcial effects
of CES-1 bioaugmentation on optimal treatment of the recalcitrant dye wastewater leading
to sludge reduction (at least 22%) as well as meeting all requirements for the wastewater
treatment standards at a full-scale system with good economic merit.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Description of Textile Dye Wastewater Treatment System and Its Operations
The treatment system was a two-stage activated sludge process modiﬁed with the
addition of a sludge digestion tank which was located at a dye wastewater treatment plant
in Daegu City, South Korea. As shown in Figure 1, the process was essentially composed
of multiple steps including the inﬂuent tank (I), the buffering tank (B), primary aeration
tank (PA), primary sedimentation tank (PS), secondary aeration tank (SA), secondary
sedimentation tank (SS), tertiary sedimentation tank (TS), and sludge digestion tank (SD).
The wastewater treatment plant routinely treated 15,000 (m3per day) of wastewater at
25–35C. One thousand (m3/day) of sludge was generated from primary, secondary,
and tertiary sedimentation tanks and transported to the sludge thickening tank. Four
hundred (m3/day) of the sludge was then transported into SD (900 m3) after ﬁltration
through a sieve screen (1 mm) and digested through bioaugmentation of the active culture
of CES-1 (15 tons per day), and the remaining sludge (600 m3/day) was subjected to
dehydration, generating dehydrated sludge (50–60 tons/D; 60% moisture). The digestion
was performed at 35–42C and under 0.5–3.5 mg/L of DO for 54 h, and then the digested
sludge was recycled into B. The composite culture CES-1 was initially enriched from the
natural soils and was originally deposited by Bayo, Inc. (Jinju, Republic of Korea) as a
proprietary culture (KCTC 12579BP) at the Biological Resource Center, Korea Research
Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (Daejeon, Republic of Korea). The medium
for CES-1 (powder form) includes the following ingredients: rice bran (35%, w/w), rice
husk (35), oak sawdust (27), and minerals including illite, perlite, and vermicu-lite (3).
The powder form culture was prepared by growing CES-1 inoculum (1%, w/w) in the
medium (moisture, 55%) at 40C for 5–7 days. The liquid culture of CES-1 was prepared
by inoculating 7 kg of CES-1 (powder form) into 1.0 m3 of water and growing it at 40C for
3 days under an aeration (50 L/min). The culture reached 108–109 (cells/mL) and was then
diluted 30 times before being augmented into the sludge digestion tank (SD) at 0.1% ( v/v)
of the total inﬂuent treated daily (15,000 m30.1% = 15,000 L). Major genera of the liquid
culture based on the pyrosequencing analysis were Clostridium (58.0%), Lactococcus (13.5),
Gluconacetobacter (11.0), Acidomonas (4.9), Klebsiella (2.9), Enterobacter (1.9), Lactobacillus (1.2),
Chitinophaga (1.1), Dyella (1.0), Acidocella (0.5), Citrobacter (0.5), Lacibacter (0.4), Burkholderia
(0.4), and others (2.7). The hydraulic retention time for the whole wastewater treatment
system was 46.2 h. Traditionally the sludge generated from the primary, secondary, and
tertiary sedimentation tanks was transported to the sludge thickening tank and then the
thickened sludge was dehydrated to reach 60% of moisture content (50–60 tons produced
per day).Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 4 of 19

2.2. Monitoring the Water Quality of Dye Wastewater Treatment System 
The samples were taken from the treatment plant and labeled with the sample name, 
month, date, and the year of the sample take n. The water quality of the dye wastewater 
treatment processes was monitored in terms of COD, T-N, T-P, NH 4+, NO 2−, NO 3−, and 
suspended solid (SS). These parameters were  measured following the Standard Methods 
for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [ 20] and using the wastew ater analysis kits 
and HS-3300 water analyzer (Humas Inc., Da ejeon, South Korea), and spectrophotometer 
(Model Optizen Pop, Mecasys Inc., Daejeon, South Korea) as previously described (Kim 
et al., 2014). pH was measured using a Neomet pH meter (Istek, Inc., Seoul, South Korea) 
and dissolved oxygen (DO) using a DO meter (Model Pro2030; YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, 
OH, USA). The color intensity was measured using platinum-cobalt (Pt-Co) analysis [20]. 
2.3. DNA Isolation from Samples and Sequencing of Metagenomes 
DNA was isolated from CES-1 and 19 samples from the different treatment steps (I, 
B, PA, SA, and SD) during the five different periods (3 March 2017–29 June 2017; 10 March 
2018–13 July 2018; and 26 October 2018). Th e names of the samples were described as 
treatment step_month and date_year. They were taken 67 days before augmentation 
(B_0303_17, PA_0303_17 and SA_0303_17), 50 da ys after augmentation (I_0629_17, 
B_0629_17, PA_0629_17, SA_0629_17, SD_0629 _17), 300 days after augmentation 
(I_0310_18, B_0310_18, PA_0310_18, SA_0310_18, SD_0310_18), 425 days after augmenta-tion (I_0713_17), and 531 days after augmentation (I_1026_18, B_1026_18, PA_1026_18, 
SA_1026_18, SD_1026_18). 0.25 g of biomass was collected by filtering each sample. To 
avoid the fragmentation of strands due to in stability in the pH, the samples were washed 
with 0.1 M of EDTA. DNA extraction procedures have been shown previously [21], and 
detailed processes for library preparation, sequ encing, and bioinformatics analysis of the 
metagenomes have been previously describe d [22]. Briefly, DNA extraction was per-
formed on 1–2 milliliters of each sample, which was accomplished using the PowerSoil 
DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc.). The samples were processed using TruSeq 
DNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Dieg o, CA, USA) and Paired-end sequencing (2 
× 150 bp) was performed on an Illumina MiSeq system (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, South Ko-rea) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

2.2. Monitoring the Water Quality of Dye Wastewater Treatment System
The samples were taken from the treatment plant and labeled with the sample name,
month, date, and the year of the sample taken. The water quality of the dye wastewater
treatment processes was monitored in terms of COD, T-N, T-P , NH 4+, NO 2 , NO 3 , and
suspended solid (SS). These parameters were measured following the Standard Methods
for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [20] and using the wastewater analysis kits
and HS-3300 water analyzer (Humas Inc., Daejeon, South Korea), and spectrophotometer
(Model Optizen Pop, Mecasys Inc., Daejeon, South Korea) as previously described (Kim
et al., 2014). pH was measured using a Neomet pH meter (Istek, Inc., Seoul, South Korea)
and dissolved oxygen (DO) using a DO meter (Model Pro2030; YSI Inc., Yellow Springs,
OH, USA). The color intensity was measured using platinum-cobalt (Pt-Co) analysis [20].
2.3. DNA Isolation from Samples and Sequencing of Metagenomes
DNA was isolated from CES-1 and 19 samples from the different treatment steps
(I, B, PA, SA, and SD) during the ﬁve different periods (3 March 2017–29 June 2017;
10 March 2018–13 July 2018; and 26 October 2018). The names of the samples were
described as treatment step_month and date_year. They were taken 67 days before
augmentation (B_0303_17, PA_0303_17 and SA_0303_17), 50 days after augmentation
(I_0629_17, B_0629_17, PA_0629_17, SA_0629_17, SD_0629_17), 300 days after augmenta-
tion (I_0310_18, B_0310_18, PA_0310_18, SA_0310_18, SD_0310_18), 425 days after augmen-
tation (I_0713_17), and 531 days after augmentation (I_1026_18, B_1026_18, PA_1026_18,
SA_1026_18, SD_1026_18). 0.25 g of biomass was collected by ﬁltering each sample. To
avoid the fragmentation of strands due to instability in the pH, the samples were washed
with 0.1 M of EDTA. DNA extraction procedures have been shown previously [ 21], and
detailed processes for library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis of the
metagenomes have been previously described [ 22]. Brieﬂy, DNA extraction was performed
on 1–2 milliliters of each sample, which was accomplished using the PowerSoil DNA
Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The samples were processed
using TruSeq DNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and Paired-end
sequencing (2 150 bp) was performed on an Illumina MiSeq system (Macrogen Inc.,
Seoul, South Korea) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
2.4. Contig Assembly and Binning of Metagenomes
The raw reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.36) with a default option
to ﬁlter low quality reads. The total reads and the GC% were shown in Table S1. Quality
trimmed reads were used for taxonomic classiﬁcation using Kraken2 with a standardMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 5 of 19
database, and the selected genes and the encoded enzymes were listed in Table S2. This
database consisted of the bacterial, archaeal, and viral genome sequences from RefSeq,
along with the human genome and UniVec. Kraken2 results may mislead the results
because the bacterial genome sequence of species (genus) level is nearly identical. Therefore,
we re-estimated the relative abundance of each taxonomic level, using Bracken for more
accurate taxonomy composition analysis.
2.5. Visualization of Metabolic Pathways and Microbial Communities
The statistical analysis of physical and chemical parameters for the wastewater was
accomplished through one-way ANOVA using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 25) with the
signiﬁcance p< 0.05. The visualization of bubble plots and analysis Spearman’s rank
correlation analysis was conducted with R software using ggplot2 and pheatmap [ 23] and
corrplot package [ 24]. The Procrustes correlation was analyzed from the VEGAN package
and plot in ggplot in R and the p-value was obtained by recalculating and normalizing
the abundance value. The simulated correlations between the pathways were conﬁrmed
ifp< 0.05 [ 25]. The network analysis was done using Gephi with the whole abundance
as a node based on a p-value (<0.05) and the modularity value as a cluster and edges.
The co-occurrence correlation between the pathway gene and the microbial community
presence was statistically checked and calculated [26].
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Wastewater Treatment Monitoring during Bioaugmentation
The efﬁciency of the dye wastewater treatment 67 days before the bioaugmentation
of CES-1 was shown in Table 1, which was used as a control for the treatments after the
bioaugmentation. The removal efﬁciencies (%) for COD, T-N, T-P , SS, and color intensity
were 94.9, 48.0, 91.6, 63.9, and 66.3, respectively. By the way, the removal efﬁciencies (%) for
COD, T-N, T-P , SS, and color intensity 50 days after the bioaugmentation were 97.8, 62.6,
95.8, 63.4, and 77.9, showing the increase of COD, T-N, T-P , and color intensity removal
efﬁciencies (%) by 2.9, 14.5, 4.2, and 11.6, respectively. This indicates that the bioaugmen-
tation of CES-1 may be effective in facilitating dye wastewater treatment. Moreover, the
removal efﬁciencies (%) for COD, T-N, T-P , SS, and color intensity 300 days (531 days)
after the bioaugmentation were 95.5 (97.3), 80.9 (75.9), 96.2 (70), 44.1 (81.3), and 90 (94),
respectively. Overall, the removal efﬁciencies for COD, T-N, T-P , SS, and color intensity
after the augmentation were higher than the control (before augmentation).
The COD removal may be one of the main parameters used to prove sludge reduction
and to understand its mechanism. Taking in the 531 days of augmentation, the removal
rate of COD was 97.3% while the removal rate of COD before augmentation was 94.9%. A
good sludge reduction (22%) was also observed at the time (Table 2). There was an increase
in the removal rate (2.5 to 20%) throughout the bioaugmentation of CES-1 compared with
the previous studies [ 26–28]. This process appeared to increase the total nitrogen removal
efﬁciencies (62.6–80.9%) of the system compared with the control (48.0%). Removal of
T-N appeared to be more active in the 0310_18 (80.9%) than before the bioaugmentation,
and this kind of trend was maintained until 531 days after the bioaugmentation removal
efﬁciencies of T-N (75.9–80.9%). The overall removal efﬁciencies of COD, T-N, NH 4+,
and T-P increased after the augmentation compared with before augmentation (Table
1). T-N removal is an important indication of the denitriﬁcation whose process requires
electron donors derived from organic materials of which concentration can be estimated by
COD. The removal rates of COD were also higher in the bioaugmented efﬂuent samples.
Therefore, the denitriﬁcation linked to T-N removal seemed to contribute to the concomitant
COD removal that triggered the reduction of sludge which was the source of organic
materials in the treatment system as shown previously [20,29].Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 6 of 19

Compliance with efﬂuent nitrogen standards affects a wide variety of dyes. Nitriﬁca-
tion is well known for its process instability due to the requirement for the close linking
of the bacterial species responsible for different parts of the removal process [ 30]. Bioaug-
mentation has been shown to offer the potential to stabilize nitriﬁcation and to deal with
transient treatment problems.
As with nitrogen, bioaugmentation has been demonstrated to have some success in
the treatment [ 31] and an improved long-term stability of treatment systems for treating
aromatic compounds under such bioaugmentation conditions was observed.
3.2. Comparative Analysis of Potential Different Metabolic Pathways Involved in Chemical
Degradation Processes in the Treatment System
Besides understanding of the wastewater treatment processes in terms of dynamics of
the chemical parameters, it will be highly worthwhile to try to understand the treatment
process at a molecular biological level based on metagenome analysis of genes (enzymes)
and microbial communities responsible for degradation of chemicals and its resulting
sludge reduction. Four groups of the metabolic pathways were compared with each other,
and the data showed that they appeared to be highly correlated with each other, indicating
they are metabolically interrelated [ 28]. Most of the samples taken after bioaugmentation
(I_0713_18, I_1026_18, B_1026_18, PA_1026_18, SA_1026_18, SD_1026_18) were highly
clustered, while the sample before the bioaugmentation (B_0303_17). The augmentation of
CES-1 appeared to allow some microbial communities to be selected strongly over others
so that these metabolic pathways could be highly functional in the positive correlations.
Procrustes analysis demonstrated a signiﬁcant association between the ordinations of
two metabolic pathways. In the association of azo dye and aromatic compound degrada-
tion, amino acid metabolism and nitrogen and phosphorus cycle with TCA cycle, B_1026_18,
and SA_1026_18 got shifted towards the TCA cycle. Most of the samples from 300 days
of bioaugmentation and CES-1 were correlated with azo dye and aromatic compound
degradation, amino acid metabolism, and nitrogen and phosphorus cycle. The rest of the
clustered samples were stretched towards the azo dye and aromatic compound degrada-
tion and amino acid metabolism. The results indicated that the samples 300 and 531 days
after the bioaugmentation showed high interrelationships and continuities among path-
ways and stretch towards the TCA cycle (Figure 2a–f). Comparison of the Procrustes plot
with chemical analysis revealed that the positive correlations of amino acid metabolism
with nitrogen cycle and TCA cycle support the higher COD removal rate in 50 days, and
531 days of augmented samples. It was assumed that the degradation of amino acid and
nitrogen cycle might facilitate the enhancement of COD removal [ 21,32]. The presence
of the TCA cycle in B_1026_18, SA_1026_18, and B_0629_17 indicates the carbon source
utilization by microbial communities, which completes the cycle of sludge reduction [29].Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 8 of 19

correlations.

3.3. Dynamic Changes of Functional Genes for Major Metabolic Pathways in Textile Dye
Wastewater Treatment Process Undergoing Bioaugmentation of CES-1 over Time
To understand mechanisms of the degradation of azo dye and other accompanying
chemicals, and sludge reduction at a molecular biological level, the metagenomic analysis
was done by sequencing the whole microbial community DNA extracted from the twenty
different treatment stages. Major functional genes were selected according to their relevant
pathways, and their dynamic changes were analyzed using their abundances in all the
samples over time.
The gene abundance proﬁles of major metabolic pathways in the treated samples
were shown in Figure 3. Starting with aromatic compound degradation, the presence of
genes involved in catechol cleavage was higher in most of the samples including CES-
1. The catechol cleavage pathway was comparatively higher than the other pathways
involved in aromatic compound degradation. According to Aghapour et al. [ 28], the
catechol cleavage leads to the formation of succinyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and pyruvate. This
requires the presence of genes involved in their pathways for amino acid metabolism.
Abundances of the dominant amino acid degradation genes were higher in CES-1 and the
samples that went through an early augmentation such as B_0629_17, SA_0629_17, and
SD_0629_17. Abundances of the TCA cycle and fatty acid degradation genes were also
higher in most of the samples. This may indicate the necessity of these pathways to provide
the carbon sources for the growth of the microbial communities. In nitrogen metabolism,
the nitrate reduction and the denitriﬁcation follow the same trends in 50 days and 531 days
of bioaugmented samples. Supporting the higher presence of denitriﬁcation genes after the
bioaugmentation, the nitrate reduction leads to a high rate of denitriﬁcation [ 22]. Analyzing
the data for chemical parameters, the samples (531 days after augmentation) with a higher
frequency of genes for degradation of amino acid, denitriﬁcation, and TCA cycle could
have contributed to the sludge reduction (Table 2).Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 9 of 19

 different treatment stages. Major functional genes were selected according to their rele-
vant pathways, and their dynamic changes were analyzed using their abundances in all 
the samples over time. 
The gene abundance profiles of major metabo lic pathways in the treated samples were 
shown in Figure 3. Starting with aromatic compound degradation, the presence of genes

echol cleavage pathway was comparatively hi gher than the other pathways involved in

Abun-dances of the TCA cycle and fatty acid degradati on genes were also higher in most of the 
samples. This may indicate the necessity of these pathways to prov ide the carbon sources 
for the growth of the microbial communities. In  nitrogen metabolism, the nitrate reduction 
and the denitrification follow the same trends  in 50 days and 531 days of bioaugmented 
samples. Supporting the higher presence of denitrification genes after the bioaugmentation, 
the nitrate reduction leads to a high rate of denitrification [22]. Analyzing the data for chemical parameters, the samples (531 days after augmentation) with a higher frequency of genes for degradation of amino acid, denitrification, and TCA cycle could have contrib-
uted to the sludge reduction (Table 2).

Unexpectedly, azo dye reductase gene ( acpD ) showed a lower frequency in most of
the samples although its removal efﬁciencies increased as the augmentation progressed
(from 78 to 94%) (Figure 4a; Table 1). Aromatic compound degradative genes ligA and
ligB (encoding protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase alpha chain and beta chain, respectively)
were dominantly carried in the augmented culture CES-1 and all the 2017 samples except
B_0303_17 and I_06_29_17, which were taken before bioaugmentation and in the early stage
of bioaugmentation. These genes almost disappeared in all the samples taken 300 days after
the augmentation (10 March 2018). However, ligB gene reappeared in all samples 531 days
after the augmentation (26 October 2018) except the inﬂuent, indicating the stabilized
maintenance of this gene in the steady-state of the treatment system. The cleavage of azo
bonds (-N=N-) and the replacement of hydroxyl group of ortho -carboxyl group with F-
(ﬂuorobenzene) lead to the breaking of benzene ring and the compound degraded into toxic-
less metabolites such as, 2-methyl-propionic acid [ 33,34]. The ligA and ligB genes might
support the asymmetric cleavage of the C–N bond, removing N in the aromatic ring, and
yielding several intermediate products, such as 9-octadecenamide, (Z)- and phenylethyl
alcohol, and p-xylene, and the breakage of benzene ring opening and the transformation of
long-chain compounds into low-molecular-weight and less-toxic stable products, such as
butanoic acid, 3-methyl-, and 4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid. A recent study has demonstrated
the successful decomposition of azo dyes into aromatic amines due to sufﬁcient electron
donor source [ 32]. Most of the functional genes involved in TCA cycle ( fbaA ,tpiA,pgk,
gpmA ,ENO ,pyk,gltA,sucD ,sdhA ,sdhB , and mdh) and fatty acid degradation pathways
were observed in most of the samples before and after the augmentation ( Figure 4b ).
Moreover, the fatty acid degradative genes encoding acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-
CoA hydratase were essentially more dominant over the whole experimental period. This
indicates that most of the genes for TCA cycle and fatty acid degradation appeared to be
widely distributed in the treatment system regardless of bioaugmentation of CES-1. AzoMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 10 of 19
dye degradation requires electrons generated from the fatty acid degrading genes and TCA
cycle [ 35]. In terms of amino acid metabolism, the dominant genes were ligK,serA ,asd,
and trpB, which were found in most of the samples over the observation period ( Figure 4c ).
The amino acid metabolic genes could be non-speciﬁcally functioning regardless of the
bioaugmentation. As to nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism, the genes responsible for
denitriﬁcation including narG ,narZ , and nxrA were relatively dominant in most samples
except inﬂuent samples and some from buffering (B_0303_17 and B_0310_18) ( Figure 4d ).
In previous studies, metagenome for a full-scale bioreactor in Aalborg, Denmark (DK),
that performed nitrogen removal in addition to phosphate removal was reported [ 36].
These observations are corresponding with the lower concentration of nitrate and nitrate in
0310_18 and 1026_18. However, the nitrite reductase gene ( nrfA ) involved in the treatment
showed 2–4 times lower abundance than the nitrate reductase and denitriﬁcation genes
(nirS,nosZ ,narG ,narZ , and nxrA ) in the later bioaugmentation, indicating that the treatment
system was operated under the conditions favoring denitriﬁcation. Total nitrogen (T-N)
and COD simultaneously decreased as the augmentation continued over the period, whose
phenomena were typically observed in denitriﬁcation process. This indicates the COD
was the main electron donor source for the removal of total nitrogen [ 37]. Therefore, these
denitriﬁcation genes appeared to be functioning in the system under an inﬂuence of the
CES-1 augmentation. The denitriﬁcation also seemed to contribute to the sludge reduction
of the system by 22% about 17 months after the augmentation.

3.4. Dynamic Changes of Microbial Commun ity Structures in Textile Dye Wastewater 
Treatment Process under Bioaugmentation of CES-1 at Different Treatment Stages over Time 
The families such as Aeromonadaceae were dominant 67 days before and 50 days 
after bioaugmentation while Bulkholderia ceae, Commamonadaceae , Dermatophilaceae, 
and Bulkholderiales_noname were dominant 300 and 531 days after the augmentation 
shown in Figure S1. Since Aeromonadaceae  were highly dominant in samples before bio-
augmentation as well as in CES-1, the family also became dominant in samples 50 days 
after bioaugmentation. Burkholderiaceae was dominant in 300 and 531 days after the aug-
mentation. In addition, Sphingobium , Sulfitobacter , Mesorhizobium , Acetobacter , Thiomonas , 
Alicycliphilus , and Burkholderia  were generally dominant before and in the early stage of 
augmentation (Figure S2), but they all became much less dominant in the later stages of 
augmentation. Several genera including Burkholderia and Sphingobium utilized the azo and 
aromatic compounds like benzene, pyrene, and flourene as a sole carbon and energy 
source [33]. Acetobacter  and Glucanocetobacter were dominant in BM-S-1 that seemed to 
play an important role in amino acid degradation pathways [30]. Our data were in agree-ment with the findings of previous studies in the dominance of Proteobacteria in dye 
wastewater samples [34,38]. Proteobacteria  are generally known to have an important role 
in the degradation of organic pollutants such  as nitrogenous, phosphorus and aromatic 
compounds. Denitrification ca n be mediated by bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, but 
most of the denitrifiers belong to the phylum [39].

bioaugmentation as well as in CES-1, the family also became dominant in samples 50 days
after bioaugmentation. Burkholderiaceae was dominant in 300 and 531 days after the

Alicycliphilus , and Burkholderia were generally dominant before and in the early stage of
augmentation (Figure S2), but they all became much less dominant in the later stages
of augmentation. Several genera including Burkholderia and Sphingobium utilized the
azo and aromatic compounds like benzene, pyrene, and ﬂourene as a sole carbon and
energy source [ 33].Acetobacter and Glucanocetobacter were dominant in BM-S-1 that seemed
to play an important role in amino acid degradation pathways [ 30]. Our data were in
agreement with the ﬁndings of previous studies in the dominance of Proteobacteria in dye
wastewater samples [ 34,38]. Proteobacteria are generally known to have an important role
in the degradation of organic pollutants such as nitrogenous, phosphorus and aromatic
compounds. Denitriﬁcation can be mediated by bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, but
most of the denitriﬁers belong to the phylum [39].
At the species level, Thiomonas_unclassiﬁed ,Alicycliphilus_unclassiﬁed , and Burkholde-
ria_unclassiﬁed were mostly dominant 67 days before augmentation and 50 days after
augmentation, but they were signiﬁcantly diminished in the later stages of augmentation
(Figure 5). Although these species seemed to be transient, they may play certain roles in
degradation of pollutants in a “low key” mode. It has been reported that Marinobacter sp.
have an ability to degrade the O-H and N-H stretching corresponding to aromatic hydroxyl
and amino groups in azo dye color index Direct Blue-1 [ 40]. The microbial community
data indicate that augmentation of CES-1 carrying Gluconacetobacter_unclassiﬁed and Ace-
tobacter_unclassiﬁed as dominant species allowed a good selection of a greater number
of species, leading to a higher diversity index (Shannon indices: 2.11–3.25) in the later
stages of augmentation compared with before augmentation and at the early stage of
augmentation (Shannon indices: 1.24–2.61). A large number of unclassiﬁed sequences
were found in dye wastewater [ 41], suggesting that a wide variety of novel species may
inhabit in the dye wastewater treatment system [ 42]. It is suggested that many degrading
microbes appeared to be enriched in B, PA, SA, and SD in the later stages of augmentation
because of long term bioaugmentation of CES-1 into SD. A. johnsonii and A. parvus carried
genes for azoreductase and proved to be efﬁcient in degrading textile efﬂuents [ 43,44].
Furthermore, Pseudomonas species carries genes for at least three different azoenzymes
azoR1 ,azoR2 , and azoR3 [45].Sphingomonas has genes for several azoreductases and has
performed both successful dye degradation and mineralization of metabolites [46]. There
were many less microbial communities present before bioaugmentation due to the presence
of high concentrated azo compounds in the wastewater [ 18]. This might have resulted in
the decrease of microbial populations and subsequently reducing enzyme activities [ 47]. In
this study, however, there was a drastic increase in the abundance of microbial communities
(by 75%) in B, SA, and SD after 300 days of bioaugmentation.Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 12 of 19

mension, the family and species level had signiﬁcance. There is no universal rule for the
estimation of the number of PCs [ 48]. It was assumed that there was a common corre-
lation between the CES-1 and the 50 days of bioaugmented samples indicating a strong
inﬂuence of CES-1 in 0629_17 samples. The positive correlation of 1026_18 and 0310_18
showed its signiﬁcance among the treatments. Additionally, Figure 6c showed a higher

studies mentioned the extraction of azoreductase, NADH-DCIP reductase, laccase, and
lignin peroxidase in Acinetobacter sp. [49]. The higher abundance of Acinetobacter sp. in the
B_0310_18 and SA_1026_18 shows its contribution to degrade azo dye through several
enzymatic mechanisms for the nonspeciﬁc reductive cleavage of azo linkage [ 36]. An

activity associated with their contribution to dye degradation.Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 13 of 19

in the later stages of bioaugmentation may prove that the microbial communities from the
family can utilize the aromatic compound as a sole carbon and energy source [33,34].
3.6. Time-Course Network Analysis among Microbial Communities, Metabolic Pathways Involved
in the Degradation of Azo Dye and Other Compounds
Based on previous studies [ 21,29,34], it was hypothesized that the bioaugmentation
of potential microorganisms in dye wastewater reduced the sludge and increased the
frequency of genes degradative for toxic organic and inorganic compounds. In general,

strong presence in all the samples of before bioaugmentation (Figure 8a). The formation of
clusters from the sample before bioaugmentation indicates that the speciﬁc genes ( FBA ,

3.6. Time-Course Network Analysis among Mi crobial Communities, Metabolic Pathways 
Involved in the Degradation of  Azo Dye and Other Compounds 
Based on previous studies [21,29,34], it was hypothesized that the bioaugmentation 
of potential microorganisms in dye wastewater reduced the sludge and increased the fre-
quency of genes degradative for toxic organic and inorganic compounds. In general, pri-
mary aeration and secondary aeration of all the time frames were formed in a common cluster with fadE, gltA, ENO , ligA, ligB, and most of genes for the nitrogen and phosphorus 
cycle metabolic pathways. Gluconacetobacter_unclassified  and PGAM , gpmA  gene had a 
strong presence in all the samples of before bioaugmentation (Figure 8a). The formation 
of clusters from the sample before bioaugmentation indicates that the specific genes ( FBA , 
PGK , pyk, nifH , and  glpQ ) and species ( Gluconacetobacter_unclassified ) used to play a major 
role throughout the treatment process. This weak connection among the treatment stages 
proves the fluctuations of mi crobial presence and the gene occurrence in the treatment 
time period.

azo and aromatic compound degradation and amino acid metabolic pathway in a speciﬁc
microbial community in the buffering treatment [13].
In the samples 300 days after the augmentation, CES-1 got closely connected (strong
edge between the samples) with SA_0310_18. This proved the impact of CES-1 on other
samples, including SA. Both CES-1 and SA were a dominant host for azo dye and aromatic
compound degradation genes including ligA,ligB,catA ,PHO ,acpD , etc. I_0310_18 and
B_0310_18 were grouped and had a major connection with PA_0310_18 and SA_0310_18,
where it clustered with SD_0310_18 with the total of 102 nodes and 431 edges with the
modularity value of 0.32. Most of the communities came under these two groups. Compar-
ing with the samples 50 days after bioaugmentation, there was little change in the clusters.

fadE,ENO , and Glucanobacter_unclassiﬁed were clustered with PA_1026_18 and commonly
present in all the bioaugmented samples after 531 days (Figure 8d). After 531 days of
bioaugmentation, the SD_1026_18 was separated from PA_1026_18 and SA_1026_18 and
formed a tight connection with nitrogen, phosphorus, and TCA cycle genes in association
with Massilia_timonae, Gluconacetobacter_unclassiﬁed , and Kosakonia_radicincitans . The overall
separation and higher connection with CES-1 proved the dominance of CES-1 in the
samples. The microbial community pattern may also depend on the fact that most bacteria
with azoreductase ( acpD ) and catechol cleavage ( catA and catB) use electron shuttles to
degrade the azo bond and oxygen inhibits this process by being a more potent electron
acceptor [ 50]. Moreover, since the concentration of COD and T-N decreased substantially
with the higher abundance and correlation of Wolinella_succinogenes ,Klebsiella_pneumoniae ,
and Acinetobacter_johnsonii in the 300 and 531 days of bioaugmented samples, the microbial
communities could have utilized COD (derived from organic materials) and T-N as carbon
and nitrogen sources [ 51]. As previously mentioned, Acinetobacter may play a major
role in dye degradation [ 41]. The network analysis can prove the potential occurrenceMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1503 16 of 19
of degrading metabolic genes in the speciﬁc species present in CES-1 and the CES-1
bioaugmented samples. The azo dye degradative gene ( acpD ) from CES-1 was present in all
the treatment timelines. The gene was highly dominant in the buffering sample (B_1026_18)
carrying Glucanacetobacter_unclassiﬁed after 531 days of bioaugmentation. Compared with
the three samples before bioaugmentation, buffering samples (B_0629_17, B_0310_18, and
B_1026_18) established a major cluster and were highly related to most of the pathway
genes and the microbial communities. Buffering carries the biomass of carbon and nitrogen
sources, and other inorganic nutrients recycled from the sludge digestion tank ( Figure 1) .
This implies that the degradative pathway genes from the microbial communities highly
occurred in B after bioaugmentation. CES-1 was continuously augmented into SD so that
the microbial communities and the genes from the culture could play a role in digestion of
the sludge of SD. The digested sludge was then recycled into B together with the CES-1
communities and their genes which were subsequently ﬂowed into PA and SA, indicating a
strong inﬂuence of CES-1 on the whole treatment system. The sludge reduction caused by
bioaugmentation was observed over the experimental period (Table 2). The metagenomic
network analysis helps us to understand molecular-based functions of degradative pathway
genes in speciﬁc microbes in the treatment process. Recently, network analysis has been
widely used to explore potential microbes and their degradative pathway genes different
environments [ 25]. The higher consistent results mentioned above indicated that the
network analysis might be a reasonable and powerful tool to provide new insights and
useful biomarker in the complex environmental examples.
4. Conclusions
In this study, effects of bioaugmentation of the composite microbial culture CES-1 on
a full scale dye wastewater treatment process were investigated in terms of water quality,
sludge reduction, dynamics of microbial community structures, and their functional genes
responsible for degradation of various chemicals. The removal efﬁciencies for COD, T-N,
T-P , SS, and color intensity after the augmentation were higher than before augmentation.
The denitriﬁcation linked to T-N removal seemed to contribute to the concomitant COD
removal that triggered reduction of sludge. Azo dye and aromatic compound degradation
and other downstream pathways were highly metabolically interrelated. Augmentation of
CES-1 allowed an increase of higher diversity index in the later stages of augmentation.
Acinetobacter sp.,Glucanacetobacter sp.,Arcobacter sp., and Marinobacter manganoxydans might
have utilized COD and T-N as carbon and nitrogen sources, leading to denitriﬁcation. The
network analysis turned out to be a reasonable and powerful tool to provide new insights
and useful biomarkers for the complex environmental conditions, such as dye wastewater
treatment system undergoing a bioaugmentation. Moreover, functional analyses of the
microbial communities using metatranscriptomics and real time PCR techniques will be
necessary to better understand the mechanisms of this bioaugmentation technology. This
novel technology may also contribute to full-scale treatments of sewage wastewater, pulp
wastewater, livestock wastewater, food wastewater, and industrial malodors.
