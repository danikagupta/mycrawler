U.S. Energy Information Administration |  State Energy Data 2020:  Consumption225Data presented in the State Energy Data System (SEDS) are expressed 
predominately in units that historically have been used in the United States, 
such as British thermal units, barrels, cubic feet, and short tons.
The metric conversion factors presented in Table E1  can be used to calculate 
the metric-unit equivalents of values expressed in U.S. customary units. For 
example, 500 short tons are the equivalent of 453.6 metric tons (500 short 
tons x 0.9071847 metric tons/short ton = 453.6 metric tons).
In the metric system of weights and measures, the names of multiples and 
subdivisions of any unit may be derived by combining the name of the unit with 
prefixes, such as deka, hecto, and kilo, meaning, respectively, 10, 100, 1,000, 
and deci, centi, and milli, meaning, respectively, one-tenth, one-hundredth, 
and one-thousandth. Common metric prefixes can be found in Table E2 .
The conversion factors presented in Table E3  can be used to calculate 
equivalents in various physical units commonly used in energy analyses. For 
example, 10 barrels are the equivalent of 420 U.S. gallons (10 barrels x 42 
gallons/barrel = 420 gallons). Appendix E. Metric and Other Physical Conversion FactorsA
