Editor: Jay GanThere is a continuously increasing worldwide concern for the development of wastewater and contaminated soil
treatment technologies. Fenton processes and biological treatments have long been used as common technolo-
gies for treating wastewater and polluted soil but they still need to be modi ﬁed because of some defects (high
costs of Fenton process and long remediation time of biotreatments). This work ﬁrst brie ﬂy introduced the
Fenton technology and biotreatment, and then discussed the main considerations in the construction of a com-
bined system. This review shows a critical overview of recent researches combining Fenton processes (as pre-
treatment or post-treatment) with bioremediation for treatment of wastewater or polluted soil. We concludedthat the combined treatment can be regarded as a novel and competitive technology. Furthermore, the outlook

1. Introduction
Water and soil pollution resulting from illegal discharge and incom-
plete treatment of waste has caused high concerns ( Fu et al., 2014;
Franco and Sarria, 2015 ). Various contaminants persisting in environ-
ment include pesticides, dyes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon,
polychlorinated biphenyl, heavy metals etc. ( Ngah et al., 2011; Brito et
al., 2015; Marina et al., 2015 ). All of these pollutants releasing into the
environment pose a huge threat to ecosystem and human health
(Freedman, 2008; Murthy and Ramesh, 2009; Trevors, 2010; Xu et al.,
2012 ), making it critical to develop treatment technologies for removal
of these pollutants from environment ( Malarvannan et al., 2009;
Bechmann et al., 2010 ).
As one of the ef ﬁcient technologies, advanced oxidation processes
(AOPs), have been frequently used for remediation of polluted soil
and water in recent years ( Huang et al., 2015 ). AOPs include various
technologies ( Vilhunen and Sillanpää, 2010; Fernández-Castro et al.,
2015; Cheng et al., 2016a ) such as Fe2+/H2O2(Kallel et al., 2009 ),
ozonation(O 3)(Esplugas et al., 2007 ), H 2O2/UV ( Moro et al., 2013 ), het-
ero-/homo-geneous Fenton-like process ( Wang et al., 2016 ),
photocatalysis ( Elghniji et al., 2012 ), and other treatment technologies
may contain electrify, ultrasonic, radiation ( Luna et al., 2012; Zhang et
al., 2013a; Huang et al., 2014 ). Fenton processes (Fe2+/H 2O2)a r e
able to oxidize pollutants by producing hydroxyl radical ( •OH)
(Maezono et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016 ).•OH is the major reactive in-
termediate responsible for organics' oxidation and is regarded as thedominant oxidant, which has been mentioned by some key publications
(Georgiadis, 2008; Rd et al., 2012 ). On account of short reaction time,
high ef ﬁciency of pollutants degradation and the wide diversity of target
contaminants, Fenton processes have become the representative AOPs.
Fe
2+is used as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxi-
dant in Fenton oxidation. On the other hand, biotreatment is regarded
as an environmental friendly method for pollutants treatment, but the
reaction conditions need to be carefully regulated ( Ganigué et al.,
2012; Wan et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2015 ). In addition, biotreatment tech-
nologies might be not effective at high pollution level due to the limited
resistance of microorganisms to toxicity ( Kundu et al., 2012 ).
Combination of Fenton processes and biotreatment is developed to
overcome the defects of Fenton technology (e.g., consumption of re-
agents and drastic reaction process, etc.) or the limitations of
biotreatment (e.g., strict reaction condition and time-consuming, etc.).The combination system has been used in wastewater and contaminat-
ed soil treatment ( Sirtori et al., 2009; Venny and Ng, 2012; Jho et al.,
2014; Bing et al., 2015 ). The Fenton process in the combination system
can improve the biodegradability of wastewater, which is bene ﬁcial to
biotreatment, while biotreatment in the same combination system can
stabilize the waste and reduce the use of Fenton chemicals. Fenton pro-
cess or biotreatment is not only a pre-treatment or post-treatment,
since the treatment would usually not ﬁnish unless the concentration
of pollutants drop to 0. So far the review about the combination of
Fenton process and biotreatment has not been reported.
This review describes the recent studies in adopting combined or se-
quential Fenton/biotreatment for wastewater and polluted soil treat-
ment, and highlights the bene ﬁts of the combined treatment. The
review ﬁrstly introduces basic information about single Fenton process
and biological treatment, followed by the considerations in the com-
bined treatment method. Meanwhile, the combined method is classi ﬁed
into (1). Fenton processes and then biological treatment, and (2). bio-
logical treatment and then Fenton processes. The outlook and future
study in this promising ﬁeld are also discussed. The structure of this re-
view is illustrated in Fig. 1 .
2. Fenton processes and biological treatment
Fenton processes (Fenton, Fenton-like and modi ﬁed Fenton) and
biotreatment have been frequently studied for pollutants removal.
Below are the basic illustrations of practical application or experimentalresearches about single Fenton processes and biotreatment.
2.1. Fenton processes
Fenton technology is a promising and alternative method for reme-
diation of soil or wastewater treatment. Laboratory, plant-scale experi-
ments and practical application of Fenton technology were conducted
by many researchers. Fenton process uses hydrogen peroxide as oxidant
and ferrous ions as catalyst. The catalytic decomposition of H
2O2in the
presence of Fe2+involves a complex chain reaction. The critical reac-
tions are listed below ( Gu et al., 2012 ):

H2O2is decomposed in the presence of Fe2+catalyst, and causes the
generation of •OH (Eq. (1)). Afterwards, the active oxidant •OH remove
recalcitrant compounds. It is essential that the chemical reaction should
be operated at pH of 2.8 –3.0, where the Fe3+/Fe2+couple can perform
catalytic behavior ( Aaron, 2014 ). The change in pH could diminish the
catalytic activity. Only a small amount of Fe2+is required to initiate
Fenton reaction because Fe2+could be regenerated (Eq. (2)).Fig. 2
shows the concise features of Fenton and Fenton-like process.Fenton reaction can be performed at room temperature and ordi-
nary pressure, and possesses high performance and non-toxicity
(H2O2is transformed into H 2O and O 2). Therefore, Fenton technology
has been extensively applied to the treatment of different wastewater
(Bautista et al., 2008 ) such as pesticides wastewater, pharmaceutical
wastewater, laboratory wastewater and fermentation wastewater.
However, there are also some limitations in Fenton process, including
the relatively high costs of reagents, and the large volume of iron sludge.The various hetero-/homo-geneous catalysts including Fe
3+,C u2+/Cu+,
pyrite, and nano zero-valent iron were used to replace the Fe2+for en-
hancing ef ﬁciency. In addition, modi ﬁed Fenton processes were devel-
oped by combining classic Fenton oxidation with the physical
methods such as UV, ultrasonic, electric or microwave. Recently, modi-
ﬁed Fenton technologies ( Bautista et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2009 ) have
been widely used for its high adaptation and degradation ability,
which are reviewed by some authors ( Bautista et al., 2008; Wang et

summarized in Fig. 3 .
2.2. Biological treatment
Biological treatment is a technology which can remove environmen-
tal pollutants by organisms or extracellular enzymes. A simple classi ﬁ-
cation of biotreatment is presented in Fig. 4 . Microbe occupied an
important position in biological treatment. The essence of biological
treatment is organic metabolism that the organisms used substrates as
energy and carbon resource, and the substrate matter can be served as
the electron donor in redox reaction of organisms' development. The or-
ganism, such as bacteria, ﬁlamentous fungi, yeast, algae or plant, is used
to remove pollutants in biotreatment technologies ( Huang et al., 2008,
2010a ). Biological treatments include composting, bioreactors, bio ﬁltersand biostimulation etc., which possess the advantage of low cost, high
removal rate, no secondary pollution and so on ( Boopathy, 2000 ). A
study of anaerobic bacterial degradation of crude methanol showed
that microorganisms in sediment degraded methanol completely
(Yuan et al., 2016 ).Bustamante et al. (2013) found that composting ef-
fectively stabilized digestate, and compost can be used as soil condition-
er. The ef ﬁciency of biological treatment is affected by environmental
conditions, species and quantity of microorganism, and characteristics
of pollutants ( Haritash and Kaushik, 2009; Huang et al., 2010b ).Aziz
and Aziz (2011) concluded that the increase in aeration rate resulted
in an increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration during
biotreatment of land ﬁll leachate. Joss et al. (2009) found that the pres-
ence of toxic substances inhibited the ammoni ﬁcation by microorgan-
isms. In addition, Lu et al. (2010) found that petroleum-contaminated
soil after composting needs a further treatment. Therefore, a

Fenton ( Padoley et al., 2011 ), photo-Fenton ( Sirtori et al., 2009 ), elec-
tron-Fenton ( Fatiha et al., 2013 ), etc. has attracted great concern.
3. Considerations in combined method of Fenton and biological
treatment
The composition of wastewater is complicated, so preliminary anal-
yses of wastewater are always performed for choosing suitable treat-
ment methods. The parameters total organic carbon (TOC), chemical
oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and toxici-
ty are analyzed. Wastewater with highly toxic should be disposed by
Fenton process ﬁrst. If the COD value of wastewater with good biode-
gradability cannot meet discharge standards, wastewater could be dis-
posed by further biological method after by Fenton process. Partially
toxic wastewater with low biodegradability and relatively high TOC
value should be pretreated by Fenton process. Fig. 5 summarizes the dif-
ferent steps necessary to apply Fenton/biotreatment in different waste-
water. From this ﬁgure, it is observed that the toxicity analyses and
biodegradability analyses were signi ﬁcant to apply combined method
of Fenton process and biological treatment. Toxicity analysis is usually
done by acute toxicity testing using microorganisms such as D. magna ,
Selenastrum capricornutum ,Vibrio ﬁscheri ,(Fernández-Alba et al.,
2002; Emery et al., 2005 ),Pseudomonas (ﬂuorescens orputida )(Lange
et al., 2006 ), and Escherichia coli (Chatzitakis et al., 2008 ), etc. In addi-
tion, the respirometric assays have been used as an ef ﬁcient method
for the measurement of acute toxicity, since the oxygen demand in as-
says represents the activity and viability of aerobic microorganisms. Bio-
degradability can be monitored by some ways which include the simpleanalysis of BOD 5and COD and the calculation of BOD 5/COD. The ratio
shows the proportion of organic matters that are biodegradable under
aerobic conditions. Additionally, Zahn-Wellens test is one of biodegrad-
ability assays. In this assay, analyzed samples are considered as biode-
gradable when the biodegradation percentage is over 70% ( Lapertot et
al., 2008 ). Although the steps of applying Fenton and biotreatment in
soil remediation are not clear, the signi ﬁcant steps like toxicity and bio-
degradability analyses used in wastewater treatment could be used as
reference.
When applying combined Fenton process and biological treatment,
there are several issues should be paid attention to:
(i). The proper dosage of chemical oxidant. For instance, too many
oxidizers would induce excessive mineralization of ef ﬂuent,
leading to insuf ﬁcient carbon source for microbes in the subse-
quent biotreatment.
(ii). The in ﬂuence of Fenton reaction on indigenous microbes. For ex-
ample, the optimal value of pH for Fenton reaction is 2.8 –3.0,
which might not be unfavourable to the growth of some indige-
nous microbes.
(iii). The inhibition of matters from previous treatment to the next
process. Organic matter might be produced in biotreatment pro-
cess, which would reduce the production of hydroxyl radicals by
reacting with catalysts in the following Fenton process.
(iv). The competition for hydroxyl radicals. Some matters in the envi-
ronment, such as soil organic matters (SOM) in soil, can compete
for hydroxyl radicals with target pollutants. Many researchers
found that the competition led to a decline of remediation ef ﬁ-
ciency ( Zapata et al., 2008 ).

suspended solids, TOC, pH, temperature and nutrients elements.
The growth of microbe is affected by nutrients elements ( Sirtori
et al., 2009 ).
In practically, for the remediation of contaminated soil, there is an-
other consideration that hydroxyl radicals may react with soil humus
due to the nonselective nature of hydroxyl radicals. In this case, the lim-
itations must be taken into account when infer the reaction mecha-
nisms, pathway and kinetics.
In general, analyses of the above different parameters could provide
useful information for applying Fenton/biotreatment. And the com-
bined method has been successfully applied in wastewater treatment
and contaminated soil remediation.
4. Wastewater treatment by Fenton processes followed by biological
treatment
Researchers focused on the application of Fenton processes followed
by biological treatment in wastewater treatment. Using Fenton process
as a pre-treatment method can improve the ef ﬁciency of biotreatment,
which is because the intermediates in the process are more biodegrad-
able than original ones. The combined method of Fenton process and bi-
ological treatment could meet more stringent regulations, and its
applications in the treatment of pharmaceuticals or personal care prod-
ucts (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) wastewater
are highlighted in this review.
4.1. Wastewater containing pharmaceuticals or personal care products
Nowadays, the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceuticals
and personal care products (PPCPs) has attracted attention ( Matamoros
et al., 2015 ). PPCPs, such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) ( Gonzalez et al.,
2007 ), tetracycline ( Wu et al., 2010 ) and alkanolamines ( Klare et al.,
2000 ), are used commonly as pharmaceuticals or personal care prod-
ucts and resistant to biodegradation. Fenton process followed by
biotreatment has been introduced for the removal of PPCPs from waste-
water ( Gonzalez et al., 2009; Harimurti et al., 2010 ).Padoley et al. (2011) used Fenton process to improve the biodegrad-
ability of pyridine and 3-cuanopyridine wastewater, because the waste-
water was characterized by high COD concentration and low
biodegradability. Then biotreatment with the isolated Pseudomonas
(pseudoalcaligenes -KPN) were carried out for further treatment. It was
observed that the removal rate of pyridine and 3-cuanopyridine
reached to 84% and 99%, respectively. Photo-Fenton reaction was opti-mized by researchers to improve the biodegradability of SMX wastewa-
ter for the subsequent biological treatment ( Gonzalez et al., 2009 ). They
found that SMX was degraded completely in a relatively short time in
the sequencing batch bio ﬁlm reactor, and aeration bene ﬁted the miner-
alization of organic carbon. Other researchers used the combined treat-
ment to treat amoxicillin and ampicillin wastewater ( Elmolla and
Malay, 2011; Elmolla and Chaudhuri, 2012 ). In addition, the combined
treatment of Fenton and activated sludge process was developed to
treat monoethanolamine (MEA) wastewater ( Harimurti et al., 2010 ).
The combined system may similar to the process shown on Fig. 6 . Re-
sults showed that the removal rates of MEA and COD in wastewater
treated by the combined method were higher than those by activated
sludge process without Fenton pretreatment. Biodegradability of MEA
wastewater was improved by Fenton pretreatment, which indicated
that the combined method is promising in the treatment of MEA waste-
water. Fatiha et al. (2013) adopted the electro-Fenton process followed
by activated sludge process to remove tetracycline from wastewater,
and 69% and 86% of TOC was removed after 2 and 4 h electrolysis, re-
spectively. Moreover, the BOD
5/COD ratio in tetracycline wastewater
was increased by using electro-Fenton method, and as a result the min-
eralization rates of tetracycline increased from 46% in the treatment
with electro-Fenton to72% in the treatment with combined method.
4.2. Wastewater containing endocrine disrupting compounds
Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are contaminants with es-
trogenic or androgenic activity at quite low concentrations, including
pesticides or herbicides (Lindan, Diuron and Linuron, etc.) ( Maria et
al., 2008 ), industrial compounds (PCBs, bisphenol A, phthalate esters,
etc.) ( Lau et al., 2005; Kaneco et al., 2006 ), and benzene ester ( Wu et
al., 2013 ), etc. Physical, chemical and biological technology was used
for treating EDCs ( Jeon et al., 2013; Komesli et al., 2015 ), and novel
Fig. 6. The whole combined treatment process including sludge treating procedure (some are modi ﬁed from Zhang et al., 2013c ).1604 D. Huang et al. / Science of the Total Environment 574 (2017) 1599 –1610combined method of Fenton and biotreatment was proved to be one of
the most effective methods ( Chen et al., 2009; Vilar et al., 2012 ).
Pesticides are resistant and many of them were regarded as EDCs
(Konstantinou and Albanis, 2003 ).Oller et al. (2007a) obtained 92% of
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal rate and 85% of pesticides re-
moval rate by photo-Fenton treatment followed by aerobic biological
reactor. Similar conclusions were con ﬁrmed in the studies reported by
Maria et al. (2008) andVilar et al. (2012) . Recent researches of remov-
ing the pesticides belonging to EDCs from wastewater by Fenton/
biotreatments are summarized in Table 1 .
Combined method of photo-Fenton and ﬁxed bed reactor was used
to break down di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in synthetic or prac-
tical wastewater ( Chen et al., 2009 ), producing a relatively low-toxic
and biodegradable solution. After photo-Fenton oxidation, the BOD 5/
COD ratio of prepared ef ﬂuents increased from 0.19 to 0.45, indicating
the enhancement of biodegradability. The removal rate of DEHP was
over 80% after 3 days of treatment with the combined method in prac-
tical wastewater, but the presence of other organic pollutants in practi-
cal wastewater decreased the removal rate.
Bamboo industry in china produces wastewater which contains or-
ganic acids, polyphenols, amino acids, ﬂavonoids, dibutylphthalate,
etc.Wu et al. (2013) found that after Fenton and sequencing batch reac-
tor (SBR) process, phthalate and derivants of benzene ester were re-
duced completely. The increase of amide and alkane may be attributed
to the existence of by-products from different stage of combined
treatment.
4.3. Wastewater containing other pollutants
The combined system has also been used in other wastewater
treatment.
Dyeing and textile wastewater was regarded as low-biodegradable
as it contains complex hard-degradable organic matters ( Zonoozi et
al., 2008; El-Desoky et al., 2010 ).Lucas et al. (2007) found that Fenton
process followed by yeast ( C. oleophila ) treatment can remove 95% of
Reactive black 5 while Fenton process alone required 5 times reagents
to achieve an identical level. The combination treatment obviously re-
lieved ﬁnancial pressure. Rodrigues et al. (2009) used a Fenton/
biotreament in a SBR to remove organic matter and color with the pur-
pose of purifying the synthetic ef ﬂuent. Global removal rates of DOC,
color and BOD 5are 90.2% 97.3%, 96.1%, respectively. They were higher
than those obtained by biologically treated ef ﬂuent 28.9%, 36.0%,
63.9%, respectively. Wei et al. (2015) observed that Fenton process en-
hanced BOD 5/COD ratio from 0.35 to 0.69 in dry-spun acrylic ﬁber
(DAF) wastewater, and toxicity was found a notable reduction via the
experiments of Vibrio ﬁsheri bacteria light loss. After biotreatment, the
average removal rates of COD, NH 4+-N and total nitrogen (TN) reached
to 82.5%, 98.4%, and 74.6%, respectively. The combined treatment
made ﬁnal ef ﬂuents meet the discharge standard.
The Fenton/biotreatments can be a useful treatment for land ﬁll
leachates, particularly the aged land ﬁll leachates. Zhang et al. (2013b)
adopted Fenton oxidation and submerged membrane bioreactor
(SMBR) as appropriate options for old land ﬁll leachate treatment.
After Fenton oxidation, the removal rate of COD was 69.0%. The nextSMBR process made the COD removal rate increase to 93.1%. The
trend of TOC is the same as COD. Silva et al. (2013) found that solar
photo-Fenton was also a bene ﬁcial pre-oxidation, which improved the
biodegradability (higher than 70%) in wastewater according to Zahn-
Wellens test.
In other studies, Wang et al. (2008) found that linear alkylbenzene
sulfonate (LAS) in surfactant wastewater were decreased from490 mg L
−1to 23 mg L−1after Fenton oxidation and then the
immobilized aerobic biomass reactor made LAS removal rate reached
to 99%. And the biodegradability has been improved obviously even at
a small concentration of H 2O2.Khou ﬁet al. (2009) used the treatments
that combined electro-Fenton, anaerobic digestion and ultra ﬁltration to
treat olive oil wastewater at pilot scale. The results showed good remov-
al rate of organic matter, and even obtained surplus energy after
methanization in this experiment. In leather wastewater treatment,
the Fenton process followed by biotreatment ( T. ferrooxidans ) system
made the removal rates of COD, BOD and chromium reached to 93%,
98%, and 100%, respectively ( Mandal et al., 2010 ). Other applications
of Fenton processes followed by biotreatment to treat different waste-
water are listed in Table 2 .
5. Wastewater treatment by biological treatment followed by
Fenton processes
Many researches con ﬁrmed that biological treatment followed by
Fenton processes is effective in the removal of pollutants from wastewa-
ter (Weiwei et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2014 ). For
example, combined anaerobic digestion reactors and photo-Fenton pro-
cess was found to yield good ef ﬁciencies (92 –97%) for removal of azo
dyes, which are well known for its resistance to biological treatment
(García-Montaño et al., 2008 ).Azizi et al. (2015) found that the ef ﬁcient
system combining SBR and Fenton almost completed decolorization of
Acid Red 18, whereas the decolorization rate was 88% in SBR. COD re-
moval rate was nearly 97%, which showed an obvious increase com-
pared to the sole treatment with SBR. Punzi et al. (2015) observed
that the photo-Fenton process performed after biotreatment increased
the removal rate of COD from 60% to 92%. In addition, the decolorization
rate of a textile azo dye was nearly 100% in the combined treatment.
Nousheen et al. (2014) took sequential biological and photo-Fenton
process for the treatment of mixed domestic and industrial wastewater.
The results showed that the biotreatment decreased pollution load in
raw in ﬂuent, and then the photo-Fenton process removed more than
90% of COD and 80% of color from waste samples. The two-step combi-
nation also made a progress for the paper mill wastewater treatment
(Fernandes et al., 2014 ). In one study, Cryptococcus podzolicus removed
68% of COD after incubation, and the next Fenton oxidation increased
the removal rate of COD and TOC to 85% and 90% respectively
(Fernandes et al., 2014 ).Zhang et al. (2014) used electro-Fenton (EF)
as a post process after biotreatment (sequencing batch bio ﬁlm reactor)
for land ﬁll leachates treatment, and obtained remarkable augment in
removal of COD and BOD 5. Some researchers obtained the similar re-
sults by three steps including biotreatment, coagulation, and EF
(Moreira et al., 2015 ). A novel research applied Fenton oxidation be-
tween two biotreatment for land ﬁll leachate treatment. In this research,

activated sludge process was further applied to remove the residual or-
ganics for meeting discharge standard. Other studies involving the ap-
plications of biological treatment followed by Fenton process are
presented in Table 3 .
6. Contaminated soil treatment by Fenton/biotreatment
Soils as well as the water are confronted with various pollutants.
Soils are mainly contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAHs), heavy metals, pesticides and fertilizers from industrial activities
and agricultural practices etc. ( Sayara et al., 2010; Garciadelgado et al.,
2015; Cheng et al., 2016b ). Soil contamination causes toxic effects on
biota, resulting in unacceptable environmental risks ( Jaco et al., 2009 ).
Remediating contaminated soil is a matter of concern because of the
potential danger that pollutants posed to local ecosystem. Common
ways including soil washing, incineration, land- ﬁlling, chemical oxida-
tion or phytoremediation were used in soil remediation ( Yeung and
Gu, 2011; Beesley et al., 2011; Mao et al., 2015 ). Fenton oxidation or
biotreatment was also considered as a good remediation method. How-
ever, there are chemical effects on soil environment resulted from
Fenton reaction, and biotreatment was usually unable to remove high-
toxic pollutants ef ﬁciently ( Neyens and Baeyens, 2003; Dibyendu et
al., 2005; Mariusz et al., 2009; Chiew et al., 2011 ). As time went by, re-
searchers developed combined method of Fenton and biotreatment in
contaminated soil remediation, showing better treatment ef ﬁciency
than sole method. Some novel studies on the application of combination
of Fenton processes and biotreatments are presented in Table 4 .
Combined method was usually used to remove petroleum hydrocar-
bon from contaminated soils. In India, researchers found that 57% of al-
iphatic fraction (C 14-C28) was removed in Fenton process and removal
rate of C 14-C28reached to75% after the next treatment by Fusarium
solani (exogenous microbes), whereas sole biotreatment only gained aremoval rate of 61% ( Buragohain et al., 2013 ).Jho et al. (2014) used
Fenton process and bioaugmentation for successful remediation of
total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) contaminated soil. Bioaugmenta-
tion means enhancing microbial activity by adding microorganisms to
soil. Another biotreatment method called as biostimulation is to en-
hance indigenous microbial community in soil by adjusting nutrients
or providing electron acceptors or electron donors ( Kanissery and
Sims, 2011; Andreolli et al., 2015 ).Goi et al. (2006) found that Fenton-
like process and biostimulation performed well in remediating oil con-
taminated soil, and the removal rate of oil was 74%. It was also observed
in other study that removal rate of TPH was 88.9% in weathered oil-con-
taminated soil by combined Fenton process and biostimulation treat-
ment ( Gong et al., 2012 ). In this study, the amount and activity of
indigenous microbes was increased in Fenton process, so the total re-
moval rate of TPH after combined method treatment was obviously
higher than that in biotreatment without pretreatment of Fenton.
Use of combined Fenton and biotreatment in creosote polluted soil,
removal rate of total PAH was 75%, with 30% increase to the
biotreatment (aerobic SBR) alone ( Valderrama et al., 2009 ). Meanwhile,
more drastic Fenton oxidation did not favor better biological treatment.
The Fenton/biological treatment was also used for polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon degradation. In the study, Raﬁn et al. (2009) found that
the degradation ef ﬁciency of Benzo[ a]pyrene increased by half and
two times, respectively, by comparing to alone Fenton oxidation and
alone biotreatment (by Fusarium solani ). In addition, Composting was
a treatment for solid waste but sometimes the compost needs further
treatment. Lu et al. (2010) carried out a laboratory study using
Fenton-like process and biotreatment for remediating petroleum-con-
taminated soil after composting. At the end of Fenton-like process, re-
moval rate of total dichloromethane-extractable organics (TEO) was
32.7%. The next biotreatment destroyed 17.9% of TEO. And toxicity anal-
yses showed that the toxicity was decreased obviously.
The use of chelator and interesting operation in Fenton/
biotreatment experiment achieved satisfactory results ( Xu et al.,Table 2

mittently to prevent the sharp increase of the temperature. The C 10-C40
compounds became more biodegradable after Fenton oxidation. Thetank oil removal rate was 93%, and increased by 31% compared with
biotreatment alone. Researchers also adopted bio-acidi ﬁcation with
Fenton oxidation to remove heavy metals in sewage sludge ( Ren et al.,
2014 ). Bio-acidi ﬁcation used Thiobacilli bacteria that can oxidize sulfur
into sulfuric acid, and then the acid could create a good pH condition
for next Fenton oxidation. It was clear in the combined treatment that
the solubilization ef ﬁciency of Cu
2+,P b2+and Cd2+increased obvious-
ly.Xu et al. (2015) used the direct electro-Fenton process before
biotreament. They found the removal rate of pyrene increased from50% (individual electro-Fenton and biotreatment) to 91.0% (combined
treatment). The combined treatment has been con ﬁrmed as a useful
method for the remediation of contaminated soil.
7. Conclusions and future research needs
This review paper ﬁrstly introduces brief information about Fenton
processes and biological treatment, and then the considerations such
as toxicity and biodegradability tests in constructing a combined system
are discussed. Furthermore, this review mainly talks about extensive
applications of Fenton/ biotreatment in wastewater treatment and con-
taminated soil remediation. In these applications, authors were dedicat-
ed to adjust chemical and biological operating conditions for cost
reduction, time saving and ef ﬁciencies improvement. So far, lots of ef-
forts have been made for the combination system, and the research
ﬁndings have brought about good progress, promoting the applications
of these attractive combination treatments.
Based on the review above, the future research is recommended.
Firstly, the applications of Fenton/biotreatment for the remediation of
contaminated soil are explored currently, and the pollutants mainly
are petroleum organic matters. Additional researches are needed into
different pollutants to improve the understanding of the potential of
Fenton/biotreatment for soil remediation. Secondly, there are insuf ﬁ-
cient instances of the new combination treatment in practical water
and soil remediation, as well as pilot-plant and large scale operations.
Thirdly, the interaction between two treatments needs to be furtherstudied because of its unde ﬁnition, and so is the degradation mecha-
nism of the combined treatment. In addition, since some substances
may compete for chemical oxidant against the pollutants in Fenton pro-
cess, it is necessary to research the solutions. Lastly, the whole expendi-
ture should be taken into account for economic plan, to assuring the
original technology will be cost-competitive.
