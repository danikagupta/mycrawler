Through the screening of a genomic library relevant genes were identified. The second component focussed on the brief characterization of biotechnologically relevant antimicrobials and phytase. The third component dealt with method development through the improvement of a broad host range selective vector and the regeneration of Streptomyces spp. in liquid broth.                     1  Identification and characterization of a gene responsible for amido black decolorization isolated from A. orientalis2  Chapter I abstract    Investigation  into the biodegradative  capability of several actinomycetes  led to the discovery of many strains possessing an ability to decolorize  a variety of azo and triphenylmethane  dyes. Of particular interest is an Amycolatopsis spp. isolate which displayed the ability to decolorize the azo dye amido black. Through the screening of a DNA library a 4.5 kbp fragment coding for the potential decolorization gene was identified. The sequencing of this gene fragment led to the prediction of seven open reading frames encoding a polyprenyl synthetase, cupin-2 conserved barrel domain, transcriptional  regulator,  membrane  protein,  DNA-damage  inducible  gene and two hypothetical proteins. A protein consisting of 312 amino acids with 77 % similarity to a conserved hypothetical protein in A. mediterranei was tentatively identified as the enzyme  of  interest.  This  is the  first  report  of  an  amido  black  biodegrading  gene identified in this species and was hypothesized to be a novel decolorizing gene. 3  1. Introduction    1.1 The history of dyes    The first use of dye in ancient Egypt can be traced to a red dyed fragment found at the Meidum site from the third or fourth dynasty (Nicholson and Shaw, 2000). The Egyptians  commonly  dyed  cloths,  using  either  plant  dyes  or  ochreous  earth.  For instance,  a blue  color  could  be  obtained  from  indigotin  found  in  the  plant  Isatis tinctorum and red from madder in Rubia tinctorum [Fig. 1.1]. They were also quite advanced in their understanding of how to attach dyes to fabrics. In particular the use of madder (which is essentially an anthraquinone dye) requires a metallic salt to allow it to bind to the fiber and it is believed the Egyptians used the salt alum to accomplish this.  
  Fig. 1.1: Tomb of Seti I at Thebes. An illustration of the various colored garments worn by the ancient Egyptians (Edublogs.org, 2010).   The majority of dyes used today are synthetic and their origins can be traced back to organic chemists. W.H. Perkin in 1856 discovered the dye mauveine while trying to synthesize the antimalarial drug, quinine. Through oxidation and boiling with ethanol he derived a purple solution, which he found bound to silk more effectively than other natural dyes. After starting up a dye-works factory his discovery allowed him to retire 4  a wealthy man by age thirty-six, as such he is remembered as the ‘father of the dye industry’ (Tyagi and Yadav, 2001).   The synthesis of dyes is a complex process. They are normally manufactured from the primary products obtained through the distillation of coal-tar. This yields aromatic molecules   which   depending   on   the   dye   will   undergo   reductive,   oxidative, condensation, nitration or sulfonation reactions (Tyagi and Yadav, 2001). About half of the dyes used today are obtained by diazotization, a reaction yielding azo dyes. Bismarck brown was the first commercial azo dye.   1.2 Dye treatment    Azo  dyes  are  routinely  utilized  for  coloration  in  various  industrial  sectors  which include  the paper,  clothing,  food,  cosmetic  and pharmaceutical  industries,  making them responsible for the generation of large quantities of dye effluent waste (Rani et al., 2009).  In fact, seven hundred  thousand  tonnes  of dyes are produced  annually (Stolz,  2001).  Colored  wastewater  discharged  into rivers  can contain  between  10- 200mg/l  of dye and a mixture  of organic  and inorganic  chemicals,  additives,  salt, acids  and alkali  compounds  (Doble  and  Kumar,  2005).  Around  90%  of  dyes  are estimated   to  enter  treatment   plants   and  be  discharged   into  rivers   chemically unchanged  (Molina-Guijarro  et al.,  2009).  The release  of colored  dyes into rivers affects photosynthesis decreasing oxygen levels and pH in these water bodies, making them   harmful   to   the   aquatic   ecosystem   (Molina-Guijarro   et   al.,   2009).   The recalcitrance of these dyes is attributed to the azo groups (-N=N-) which do not occur naturally in nature (Bafana et al., 2008).   Many bacteria, fungi and yeast capable of decolorizing azo dyes have been isolated and their azoreductases and oxidases characterized (Suzuki et al., 2001; Blümel et al., 2002; Kokol et al., 2007). Many bacteria are capable of a non-specific reduction of the azo bond under anaerobic conditions, however this can lead to the unfavorable production  of  carcinogenic   by-products  (Grekova-Vasileva   et  al.,  n.d.).  Within humans several species of anaerobic bacteria known to reside in the intestinal tract have been associated with azoreductase activity (Rafii et al., 1990). 5  Concern   over  human   health  and  the  environment   has  necessitated   legislation monitoring the use of azo dyes in many countries.  Considerable  research has been conducted on both the chemical and physical removal of synthetic dyes and currently these  are the strategies  of choice  when treating industrial  effluent  (Forgacs  et al., 2004; Robinson  et al., 2001).  Physical  and chemical  means of removing  dyes are expensive; these include adsorption, precipitation, filtration, photolysis and ion pair extraction  (Nigam  et  al.,  1996;  Sani  and  Banerjee,   1999).  There  are  various advantages  and disadvantages  associated with the different treatment methods.  For instance, membrane technology is fast yet expensive to implement when dealing with high volumes. Adsorption by charcoal is slow, has a high cost and only works well when applied to small volumes (Azmi et al., 1998). Coagulation is cheap yet works at a moderate speed.   Table 1.1: Methods for the treatment of dye wastewater    Physical  Chemical  Biological  Adsorption Sedimentation Floatation Flocculation Coagulation Foam fractionation Polymer flocculation Reverse osmosis/ ultrafiltration Ionization radiation Incineration (Azmi et al., 1998)  Neutralization Reduction Oxidation Electrolysis Ion exchange Wet air oxidation  Ozonation  Stabilization pond Aerated lagoon Trickling filter Activated sludge Anaerobic digestion Bioaugmentation 
  Oxidation using hydrogen peroxide is the most commonly used chemical means of decolorization  due  to  its  simplicity  (Robinson  et  al.,  2001).  The  photochemical technique relies on the generation of hydroxy radicals, degrading dyes to harmless end  products.  The  obvious  disadvantage  is  the  addition  of  large  quantities  of 6  chemicals into the effluent. The adsorption ability of dyes onto organic or inorganic substrates has also been tested. These include wood charcoal, activated carbon, coal and alumina. Cheaper substrates such as clay, corn cobs and rice hulls have also been tested  (Robinson  et al.,  2001).  While  some  of these  studies  have  generated  good results, they are limited in terms of expense and most have tested the removal of a single dye. Still the adsorption of the dyes onto these supports does not resolve the full problem, since the fate of these attached compounds still needs to be addressed. Microbial  decomposition  on  the  other  hand  offers  more  promising  results.  The process is less expensive and complete mineralization  would lead to non-toxic end products  (Forgacs  et al., 2004).   It is likely however  that a combination  of either chemical or physical means together with a microbial strategy will be the answer.   1.3 Dye classification    Dyes fall into many classes based on their chemical structural diversity. Over 100 000 exist of which over 2000 are azo dyes, making this the largest class of compounds used (Vijaykumar et al., 2007; Stolz, 2001). Some of these classes do not have an equivalent that occurs in the natural environment, these include xanthenes, phenothiazines and sulfur type dyes (Tyagi and Yadav, 2001). 7  Table 1.2: Types of dyes based on structure    Type of dye Triphenylmethane Anthraquinone Vat Indigoid Azo Polymethine Aryl carbonium Nitro Xanthene Sulfur Nitroso Diphenylmethane Phthalein Heterocyclic Phthalocyamine Miscellaneous (Tyagi and Yadav, 2001)   i)  Anthraquinone dyes    9,10 Anthraquinone forms the backbone of these dyes and it is the incorporation of amino-,  hydroxy-,  alkyl-,  aryl-  or  alkoxy-  groups  which  leads  to  differences.  An example includes remazol brilliant blue R [Fig. 1.2]. 
 Fig. 1.2: Remazol brilliant blue R structure (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999) 8  ii)  Polymethine dyes    These dyes can be positively or negatively charged, or neutral depending on the atom bound [Fig.1.3]. Examples include CI basic red 12, CI basic blue 41 and oxonol.                   Fig. 1.3: CI basic red 12 structure   iii)  Phthalocyamine dyes    This is one of the more recently discovered dyes which consist of metal complexes  [Fig.1.4] (Tyagi and Yadav, 2001).  
    Fig. 1.4: Reactive blue 15 structure (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999)    iv)  Azo dyes    The  azo  dyes  are  the  most  extensively  studied  in  addition  to  being  the  most commercially important. The basic structure includes an azo bond (-N=N-) which is not found naturally in nature, making them difficult to degrade.  Examples  include amido black (a diazo dye which contains two azo bonds) and tropaeolin [Fig. 1.5]. Sulfonated azo dyes characterized  by the presence of a SO3H group are commonly 
9  found in industrial effluents.   
  Fig. 1.5: Tropaeolin structure, a mono azo dye (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999)    v)  Triphenylmethane dyes    As the name suggests, these contain three phenyl radicals with hydroxyl or NH2 introduced  into the ring (Tyagi and Yadav,  2001).  Examples  include  crystal  violet, brilliant green, malachite green and fast green [Fig. 1.6].   
   Fig. 1.6: Illustration of fast green    The structural design and electron withdrawing capacity of dyes makes them highly resistant to light, oxidizing agents and microbial oxidases (Rani et al., 2009; Grekova- Vasileva   et  al.,  n.d.).  The  number  of  azo  bonds,  functional   group  type  and arrangement  on the compound greatly influence its degradative  capacity. Thus, the differences  in  decolorization  by  microbes  can  be  attributed  to  the  complex  dye structures as well as culture conditions and genetic variations (Rani et al., 2009).   1.4 Aerobic and anaerobic mechanism of dye degradation    There are numbers of hypotheses concerning mechanisms of azo dye decolorization by bacteria, employing either intracellular cytosolic enzymes, extracellular enzymes or non-specific extracellular  reduction  (Doble and Kumar,  2005). Under anaerobic 10  conditions two mechanisms of azo dye decolorization have been proposed. The generation of ATP during catabolism produces electrons which can be transferred to the azo dye inducing breakage of the azo bond [Fig. 1.7] (Doble and Kumar, 2005). The other mechanism is due to the reducing action of end products such as inorganic compounds  produced  through  catabolic  reactions  that cleave  the dye. Thus,  under non-oxygenated conditions many bacteria are capable of decolorization. This process however is documented as a non-specific breaking of the azo bond often resulting in the  generation  of  toxic  and  carcinogenic  products  (McMullan  et  al.,  2001).  To alleviate this problem an anaerobic-aerobic  treatment system has been proposed in which  the  dead-end  toxic  by-products  generated  under  anoxic  conditions  can  be broken down aerobically. Rajaguru et al. (2000) reported on the complete reduction of multiple sulfonated azo dyes by strains using an anaerobic-aerobic system.   Under aerobic conditions electrons move through the electron transport chain to the final electron acceptor, the azo dye which is reduced and thus decolorized and the flavin nucleotide reoxidized (Robinson et al., 2001).  
   Fig. 1.7: A proposed redox reaction for the degradation of azo dyes under anaerobic conditions by whole bacterial cells (Doble and Kumar, 2005) 11  If dye reduction occurs intracellularly the molecule must diffuse across the cellular membrane. The presence of sulfonate groups has been linked to a reduced transport of the molecule across the membrane (Doble and Kumar, 2005). Although the relevant transport systems have not been identified yet, it has been suggested that they could be similar to systems which transport other sulfonated substrates such as, p- toluenesulfonate, taurine or alkanesulfonates (Blümel et al., 2002).   Mediators  are often used to enhance  dye break down.  In fungi veratryl  alcohol is typically used. Azo dye reduction by Sphingomonas spp. BN6 was increased in the presence   of  the  redox  mediator   antraquinonesulfonate   (Kudlich   et  al.,  1997). Similarly,  Liu et al. (2009) documented  decolorization  by E. coli spp. which only occurred in the presence of lawsone.   Kudlich et al. (1997) found two azoreductases within Sphingomonas spp. BN6 [Fig.  1.8].  It  was  shown  that  while  one  remained  membrane  bound  the  other  was cytoplasmic. Characterization tests verified that these reductases were in fact variable, reacting differently to inhibitors. Similarly, more than one reductase has been isolated from B. cereus, B. subtilis and Bacillus SF (Nachiyar and Rajakumar, 2005).  
  Fig. 1.8: Proposed mechanism for redox mediator (RM) dependent reduction of azo dyes by strain BN6 (McMullan et al. 2001)   Goszczynski  and coworkers  (1994)  looked  into the concept  of developing  readily biodegradable dyes. They introduced a lignin type subunit into two sulfonated dyes, making  them  more  accessible  to  enzymatic  oxidative  attack  and  consequently 12  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  facilitating the complete breakdown of the compound. The fungal and actinomycete peroxidases tested were able to completely decolorize the dyes in just over two hours. To  quote,  “Such  research  could  also  exemplify  how  a  new  generation  of  less recalcitrant chemicals might be produced in the future” (Goszczynski et al., 1994).  Pasti-Grigsby et al. (1996) synthesized several dyes in order to analyze the effect of different  configurations  of  chemical  groups  in  relation  to  the  azo  bond  and  the influence thereof on the biodegradability. To summarize their results, they found that a hydroxy  group in the para position  as opposed  to the ortho  position  was more favorable  for  degradation.  Furthermore,  methyl  groups  in  the  ortho  position  in relation to the hydroxy group were broken down more easily. Overall, replacement of the sulfonic groups by carboxylic groups led to the reduction of dyes which prior to this manipulation could not be broken down. In general, manipulations which made the dye structures similar to natural compounds (in this case lignin) greatly enhanced susceptibility by microbial attack [Fig. 1.9].                               
     Fig. 1.9: Complex lignin structure  13   1.5 Bacterial oxidases implicated in dye degradation    Reductases are commonly identified in relation to dye biodegradation. However, there are a few cases in which oxidases have been isolated; Streptomycetes  produce peroxidases and laccases which are ligninolytic enzymes. Many publications, particularly with regard to fungi concentrate on oxidases linked to dye decolorization (see section 1.6). Goszczynski  and coworkers  (1994) identified  a S. chromofuscus peroxidase  capable  of  degrading  sulfonated  dyes  and  where  able  to elucidate  the pathway [Fig. 1.10].  
    Fig.  1.10:  Proposed  mechanism  for  symmetrical  and  asymmetrical  cleaving  of sulfonated azo dye by P. chrysosporium and S. chromofuscus peroxidases (ligninases) (Goszczynski et al., 1994). In azo dye 1: R1=R2=CH3  and B=O, in azo dye 2: R1=H, R2=OCH3 and B=NH 14  Molina-Guijarro and colleagues (2009) isolated a novel halotolerant laccase from S. ipomoea that in the presence of a redox mediator was capable of detoxifying 90% of the azo dye orange II. Telke et al. (2009) reported on the combined involvement of a phenol  oxidase  and  NADH-DCIP  reductase  from  Bacillus  spp.  ADR  on  reactive orange.   1.6 Decolorization and degradation of azo dyes by fungi    The first study to report on the biodegradation  of dyes by the white rot fungus, P. chrysosporium was conducted almost 27 years ago. Since then this species has been recorded as decolorizing amaranth, tropaeolin O, remazol black B, remazol orange, reactive  blue,  remazol  brilliant  blue,  reactive  orange  16  and  naphthol  blue  black (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999; Svobodova et al., 2006). T. versicolor has also joined the ranks as an effective candidate for dye degradation, decolorizing sulfonated and mono azo dyes as well as reactive dyes (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999).   Fungi, in particular white rot fungi which produce ligninolytic  enzymes have been widely studied for their ability to degrade an extensive array of compounds. They are renowned for their possession of manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase and laccase which are involved in the breakdown of lignin. In fact, this enzyme system has been found  to  have  a  low  structural  specificity  and  to  act  on  diversely  structured compounds   such   as   synthetic   dyes,   aromatic   hydrocarbons   and   chlorinated compounds (Rani et al., 2009; Pickard et al., 1999. Lignin peroxidase oxidizes non- phenolic   compounds   and  manganese   peroxidase   oxidizes  phenolic   compounds. Laccase,  by reducing oxygen also oxidizes phenolic compounds  (McMullan  et al., 2001). In general, acidic conditions (pH 4.0-5.0) favor the activity of these enzymes, which is a limitation since textile dyes carry a high pH (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999; Kokol et al., 2007). However, the extracellular nature of these enzymes means that the problem of substrate diffusion into the cell is not encountered in fungi (Kaushik and Malik, 2009). High concentrations of nitrogen sources (25-60mM) tend to impede decolorization   while  in  general   glucose   seems   to  be  the  best  carbon   source supplement (Kaushik and Malik, 2009).  There are numerous studies depicting the multifarious ligninolytic enzyme system in 15  connection to dye degradation: the white rot fungus, Phlebia radiata decolorized 12 synthetic dyes, namely amaranth,  chromotrope  2B and 2R, tropaeolin 000, metanil yellow,  amido  black,  congo  red,  chlorazole  black  E,  trypan  blue,  chicago  blue, procion red HE-7B and procion red M8B, six of which were decolorized completely (Rani et al., 2009). Laccase and manganese peroxidase of Ischnoderma resinosum led to 80-90% decolorization of four reactive dyes in just twenty four hours (Kokol et al., 2007). Promising studies include the use of purified enzymes to mineralize dyes. The laccase isolated from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus degraded 70% of chicago sky blue in 1 hour. Similarly, manganese peroxidase from Trametes versicolor resulted in 100%  decolorization in 1 hour (Kaushik and Malik, 2009).    1.7 Detoxification    It is no longer enough to merely show degradation of azo dyes; in recent years studies have emphasized the need to verify detoxification  of the dye as well. Bafana et al. (2008) were one of the first to carry out tests verifying the toxicity and mutagenicity reduction of direct red in the presence of B. velezensis strain AB.   1.8 Genes /enzymes responsible for azo dye mineralization/ decolorization    Much of azoreductase research has been approached directly from the protein route whereby purification of the enzyme has led straight to its biochemical characterization (Goszczynski,   1994;   Grekova-Vasileva    et   al.,   n.d.;   Moosvi   et   al.,   2007)). Unfortunately,  this has led to a lack of sequence information of potentially unique enzymes. Suzuki and fellow researchers (2001) opted for the rare approach of DNA screening and designed a probe, screening a Bacillus spp. OY1-2 library for the gene responsible for the reduction of methyl red, acid red 88 and reactive black 5. They identified a 20 kDa NADPH-reductase,  which they proposed  to be a member of a novel family of enzymes due to the highest similarity of just 52.8% to a sequence in the database. A few years later, these researchers also isolated the homolog of this gene from B. subtilis ATCC6633,  B. subtilis ISW1214  and G. stearothermophilus (Sugiura  et  al.,  2006).  Using  the  same  strategy,  Blümel  and  colleagues  (2002) identified a 30kDa enzyme from Xenophilus azovorans KF46F involved in carboxy- orange II reduction. Peculiarly, the gene sequence did not have a significant match to 16  
  other sequences  in the public  database  and shared  no significant  similarity  to the reductase identified in Bacillus spp. OY1-2, even though both strains are β- proteobacteria.  Notably,  sequence  information  revealed  that  both  enzymes  were simple polypeptides  containing  no enzyme  cofactors  or metal  ions (Blümel  et al., 2002). The sequences of these genes are under the following accession numbers: B.  subtilis  ATCC6633  (AB071366),  B.  subtilis  ISW1214  (AB071368),  G. stearothermophilus  (AB071367),  X.  azovorans  KF46F  (AF466104),  Bacillus  spp. OY1-2 (AB002631), E. faecalis (AY422207) and R. sphaeroides (AY150311) [Fig. 1.11].   
   Fig.  1.11:  Structure  of E. coli azoreductase  (left)  and E. faecalis  FMN-dependent azoreductase (right) from PubMed database   1.9 Classification of bacterial azoreductases    Azoreductases  are first classified broadly based on their oxygen requirement, being either active in the presence or absence of oxygen (Bafana and Chakrabarti, 2008). Due to the existence of a low level of similarity based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of these enzymes, classification  is based primarily on the secondary and tertiary structure. These enzymes are further classified along the basis of function, being either flavin dependent or independent. Flavin dependent reductases are further characterized  based  on their  requirement  for NADH,  NADPH  or both  coenzymes (Punj and John, 2009). Bürger and Stolz (2010) have just recently proposed a three group classification system based on preferential cofactor usage. The first group encompasses  FMN  dependent  enzymes  that  preferentially  use  NADH,  the  second 17  
  group consists of NADPH utilizing enzymes and the third group are flavin-free reductases.   Based on the nucleotide  and primary amino acid level, azoreductases  show a low level of similarity which caused researchers to conclude that these reductases arose independently  in  different  bacterial  strains.  Abraham  and  John  (2007)  however dispute this, showing that similarities do exist on the tertiary structural level. Correspondingly,  they were able to develop  a classification  system  based on this. Their simple yet profound study compared the azoreductases of four Bacillus species, R. sphaeroides and E. faecalis.  
   Fig. 1.12: (Left) superimposed images of amino acid sequences generating a tertiary structure (3D) of Bacillus subtilis (yellow) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (blue) and (right) superimposed images of amino acid sequences generating a tertiary structure (3D) of B. subtilis (red) and Enterococcus faecalis (blue) (Abraham and John, 2007)   By superimposing the 3D structures of the azoreductases they were able to conclude that the four Bacillus spp. and R. sphaeroides could be classified as one family while E. faecalis could be placed under a separate family [Fig. 1.12]. Although quite diverse in structures  it was also found  that E. faecalis  and Bacillus  spp. were capable  of degrading methyl red to different extents.   Most   reductases   identified   thus  far,  are  monomers,   the  exceptions   being  the homodimers of E. coli and E. faecalis and unusual tetramer of S. aureus (Bafana and Chakrabarti,  2008). The optimal pH for many bacterial azoreductases  seems to lie within a range of 6 to 8 with a temperature range between 25oC to 45oC. To name a 18  few, previous reports include the 21.5 kDa reductase of B. cereus with an optimal activity at 40oC and a pH of 7.0 (Pricelius et al., 2007), a P. aeruginosa reductase active at pH 7.0 and 35oC (Nachiyar and Rajakumar, 2005) and A. hydrophila with optimal activity at pH 5.0-10.0 and 25-37°C (Chen et al., 2003).

A  commendable  paper  by  Bafana  and  Chakrabarti (2008) however suggested otherwise. They detailed the phylogeny of azoreductases from selected eukaryotes  and prokaryotes.  Using the sequence  information  derived from  nine  bacteria,  four  mammals  and  one  yeast  strain  they  constructed  trees depicting the relation of reductases  in different species.  They were able to infer a pattern  of  lateral  gene  transfer  between  diverse  organisms.  Hence,  they  put  forth several noteworthy hypotheses, represented in Fig. 1.13. Grouping of reductase genes of a firmicute with an α-proteobacterium  was indicative of a lateral transferal from one  to  the  other.  Similarly,  a  transferal  from  the  γ-proteobacterium,  E.  coli  to  a firmicute was evident and could be explained by inhabitation of the same niche as both are intestinal microflora. Thus, azoreductases are proposed to be monophyletic. The close grouping of yeast with prokaryotic strains as opposed to with eukaryotes showed that yeast obtained the gene from bacteria. This allowed them to propose that azoreductases  initially evolved in prokaryotes  and were laterally  transferred  to the ancestors of yeast. Significantly,  they found that β-proteobacteria  azoreductases,  P. kullae and X. azovorans were related. While the original researchers who had isolated the genes from these species were able to find no connection due to high sequence dissimilarity, the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Bafana and Chakrabarti (2008) found these reductases fell within the same cluster. However, the researchers claimed that this was not easy to detect possibly due to several mutational insertions in the P. kullae gene and a supposed rapid divergence of the genes. 22

(2007) identified three isolates from a contaminated site as Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus spp. and P. polymyxa. Together these isolates were able to decolorize  nine dyes, however individually  showed no capacity for decolorization. Similar results were reported by Nigam and coworkers (1996) whereby independent decolorization by strains was not detected yet as a consortium a considerably wide range of dyes were reduced. A consortium consisting of four isolates, P. putida, B. cereus, P. fluorescence and S. acidaminiphila decolorized C.I. acid red 88 in 24 hours while individual isolates took longer than 60 hours (Khehra et al., 2005). 23  1.12 Treatment of azo dyes    Fungi  have  progressively  overtaken  bacteria  in bioreactor-based  studies.  The non- specific activity of the ligninolytic system of white rot fungi allow them to act on a much wider range of substrates. The breakdown of reactive orange 16 in the presence of the white rot fungus, Irpex lacteus was compared in a trickle bed and rotating disk reactor (Tavčar et al., 2006). Although the highest mineralization (90% in three days) was detected using the trickle bed method, the small scale reactor was completely clogged after a month due to excessive mycelial growth. Other bioreactor  systems have  also  been  developed  and  met  with  more  success,  namely  the  packed-bed bioreactor, fluidized bioreactor and membrane bioreactor (Kaushik and Malik, 2009).   Robinson et al. (2001) reviewed literature concerning the chemical, physical and biological methods of dye removal and proposed a combination  of methods which they believe would be most applicable on a large scale [Fig. 1.14].    
   Fig. 1.14: Textile effluent decolorization and dye adsorbed agricultural residue biodegradation (Robinson et al. 2001). 24  Accordingly,  they  proposed  that  the  dye  should  be  adsorbed  onto  a  cheap  waste product (an agricultural residue) which can be treated using solid state fermentation in the presence of white rot fungi. The removal of the dye will be accompanied by the colonization of the substrate. As such, the fermented fungal biomass and residue can be used as a soil fertilizer. 25  1.13 Project significance    The  removal  of  dyes  in  wastewater  treatment  plants  still  involves  physical  or chemical processes. Yet numerous studies currently exist on degradation based on the use  of  microbes  -  this  is  in  fact  a  well-studied  field.  The  question  is  what  has prevented progress of the use of biological methods to deal with this environmentally noxious  waste?  The drawback  originates  from the types  and numbers  of dyes;  in essence their diverse structures.  Isolating a bacterial strain capable of mineralizing dyes within more than one class is rare; yet more than fifteen classes exist, two of which  i.e.  triphenylmethane  and  azo  dye  classes  occur  predominantly  in  textile effluent (Yang et al., 2009). As such, since wastewater normally contains an array of dye classes (and thus structures) the effective treatment of this wastewater would need to include microbes with the ability to degrade numerous structurally diverse dyes. Thus, the isolation of relevant bacteria and the identification of relevant genes is just the starting point. I looked into the concept of the heterologous expression of functionally   relevant   genes   in  an  attempt   to  increase   the  range   of  substrate degradation not present in the original host.   1.14 Objectives    i.  Screening  of  environmental  isolates  and  known  strains  for  the  ability  to decolorize azo and triphenylmethane dyes ii.

Materials and methods    2.1 Growth and maintenance of strains    2.1.1 Actinomycetes    Mycelial  actinomycete  strains were grown under aerobic conditions  in Erlenmeyer flasks containing LB media and glass beads to disperse the cells. These were grown at 30oC for 1-2 days on a 30 rpm shaker. Mycobacterial strains were grown at 37oC in  LB media containing 0.05% Tween 80. Rhodococcus spp. and Gordonia spp. were cultured in LB at 30oC for 2-3 days.   Strains were maintained on non-selective LA plates and appropriate strains streaked onto minimal media plates to induce sporulation.   2.1.2 Non-actinomycete strains   Escherichia coli strain MM294-4 was grown on a rotating wheel at 37oC overnight in the  presence  of 30  µ g/ml  nalidixic  acid.  The  λ lysogen  strain  (λ MM294-4)  was grown overnight at 30oC to prevent phage induction. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cultured in YPD media at 30oC. Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. were grown in LB at 37oC with vigorous shaking to maintain adequate aeration. Micrococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Agrobacterium spp. were cultured in LB at 30oC for 1-3 days till a dense culture was obtained.   2.1.3 Storage of strains and DNA    For long term storage of Streptomycete strains, spores or mycelia were stored in 33%  glycerol at -70oC. Similarly, non-actinomycete  cells were stored in 33% glycerol at  -70oC.  Plasmid  DNA  was  stored  at  -20oC  in  sterile  distilled  water  containing ribonuclease and chromosomal DNA in 4mM Tris-HCl at -20oC. 28  2.2 Chemicals    List of the dyes used in this study: eriochrome black T, orange II, congo red, crystal violet, amido black, fast green,  biebrich  scarlet, ponceau  S, janus green, bismarck brown  Y, brilliant  green,  tartrazine,  amaranth,  basic  fuchsin,  malachite  green  and indigo.   2.3 Strains and vectors    Table 2.1: Bacterial strains    Species Strain Characteristics Source Region and country Escherichia coli MM294-4 endA1, hsd R17, gyr A, highly transformable Dabbs E.R - Escherichia coli λ lysogen λ lysogen of MM294-4 Dabbs E.R - Escherichia coli GM2929-1 Dam- dcm- Dabbs E.R - Streptomyces lividans 66 tetR, chlR, weak methylation dependent restriction John Innes Institute - Streptomyces lividans TK23 Highly transformable streptomycete host, amido black decolorizer, non- crystal violet decolorizer, phytase producer John Innes Institute -

Bacteria  were spotted  onto  the plates using a replicator  and incubated  at 30oC.  The plates  were monitored  continuously  over  a  period  of  7 days  and  viewed  above  a  white  light 32  illuminator.  The detection of clear zones surrounding the colonies was recorded as decolorization.   Decolorization experiments in liquid culture were carried out in test tubes containing  5 ml of minimal  media broth in addition  to the appropriate  dye/s (10 µg/ml)  and carbon  source  (0.25%).  The  inoculum  was  prepared  by  growing  the  strains  in complex media till a high cell density was obtained. This was washed three times in sterile distilled water to remove the rich media and an equal volume added to each of the test tubes. Decolorization  was monitored spectrophotometrically  by reading the decrease in absorbance of the supernatant  at the absorbance  maxima for each dye. This was done as follows:  after the incubation at the appropriate temperature, 1 ml of the culture was microfuged to remove the bacterial pellet and the supernatant added to an absorbance cuvette. Uninoculated controls were included to determine the initial absorbance (A0) for the optical density reading. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and an average used for the calculation.   The percentage of decolorization was calculated as by Rani et al. (2009):    %  decolorization = A0  - A   x 100  A0  where,  A0 =  initial absorbance and A = absorbance following bacterial inoculation at time t. Bacteria were not preconditioned prior to inoculation for decolorization experiments.   2.6 DNA manipulations    2.6.1 Salt and ethanol precipitation    DNA was precipitated by adding 1/10 volume of 1M NaCl and 2 volumes of chilled ethanol to the sample. This was inverted and microfuged (13 000 rpm; 25 min.) at 4oC. The supernatant  was discarded  and the microfuge  tubes blotted onto a paper  towel. The pellet was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator for ± 20 min. The DNA was 33  then resuspended in 4mM Tris-HCl or sterile water to which 1 µ l ribonuclease (10 mg/ml) was added.   2.6.2 DNA digestions    Restriction enzymes used were purchased from MBI Fermentas or Boehringer Mannheim. 0.5 units of the relevant restriction enzyme and 1.5 µ l of complementary buffer was added to 10 µ l of DNA and incubated overnight.   Double digestions were performed in a single buffer in which both enzymes exhibited maximal activity.   Partial digestions involved the determination  of the enzyme dilution whose activity yielded optimal fragment sizes when analyzed on an agarose gel. A four-fold serial dilution of the restriction enzyme was carried out, added to the DNA and buffer and incubated overnight.   2.6.3 Phenol-chloroform DNA purification    The volume of the DNA sample was adjusted with TE buffer to 500 µ l. One hundred and seventy µl of phenol was added, inverted and microfuged for 5 min. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube. Two hundred and thirty µl of chloroform  was added,  inverted and microfuged  for 1 min. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a sterile Eppendorf and precipitated with salt and ethanol.   2.6.4 DNA ligations    For ligations a 3:1 ratio of restricted genomic DNA to vector DNA was added to 2 µ l  10X ligation buffer and 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase.  The total reaction volume  was adjusted to 25 µ l with sterile water and incubated overnight at 22oC. 34  2.6.5 Agarose gel electrophoresis    DNA  was  analyzed  on  agarose  gels  run  in  0.5  TBE  (See  Appendix  for  gel preparation).  Plasmid  DNA  and chromosomal  DNA  were  run  on  0.8%  and  0.4% agarose respectively.   2.6.6 Photography and visualization of agarose gels    Gels were  viewed  under UV light using a Biorad  gel doc system  and gel images recorded.   2.6.7 Fragment size determination and DNA quantification    DNA fragment sizes were determined by comparing their position in relation to that of the DNA molecular weight markers (MBI Fermentas 1kb DNA Plus marker) when run on agarose gels.   DNA was quantified by loading equal volumes of the molecular weight marker and sample onto an agarose gel. The band intensity was compared to that of a selected marker of known concentration using LabWorks 4.5 Image Acquisition and Analysis Software. Alternately, DNA concentration was determined using the Nanodrop 1000 UV spectrophotometer by comparison against an appropriate blank solution.    2.6.8 Extraction of DNA from agarose gel slice    This was done using the freeze-squeeze  method.  The gel slice was placed into an Eppendorf tube and placed at -70oC for 30 min. A metal spatula was heat sterilized and allowed to cool. After 30 min. the Eppendorf tube containing the agarose piece was allowed to thaw at room temperature. Once fully thawed the metal spatula was used to crush the gel slice and the supernatant transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube. This was subjected to a single phenol-chloroform treatment (section 2.6.3) and precipitated with salt and ethanol (section 2.6.1). The resulting DNA was resuspended in 10-20 µl of sterile water. This was then used for relevant ligations. 35  2.7 Analysis of 16S rRNA    2.7.1 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 16S rRNA gene    The first 500 bp of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using MicroSeq® 500 primers. The following reagents were added into 0.2 cm thick walled PCR tubes: 5 µ l x10 Taq buffer, 1.5 µ l 50mM MgCl2, 1 µ l 10mM dNTP, 1 µ l DMSO, 10 µ l sterilized water, 2 µ l forward primer, 2 µ l reverse primer, 2 µ l DNA template (100ng/µ l) and 0.5 µ l Taq polymerase (5U/µ l) giving a total reaction volume of 25 µ l. The conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95oC for 30 seconds, annealing at 60oC for 30 seconds and extension  at 72oC for 45 seconds  set at 30 cycles,  using  a BioRad  MJ Mini TM Gradient  Thermal  Cycler  PCR  machine.  The PCR  product  was purified  using  the Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit and cloned into vector pGEM-T Easy. This was transformed into E. coli XL-Blue and the recombinant vector selected by means of  blue-white screening. Furthermore, the vector was extracted using the GFX™ Micro Plasmid Prep kit and sent to Inqaba for sequencing. A Spectromedix LCC sequencer was  used  in  conjunction  with  an  ABI  BigDye  Terminator  v3.1  sequencing  kit. Microbial  identification  was made  by aligning  sequences  to those  in the PubMed public database.   2.8 Extraction of microbial DNA    2.8.1 Genomic DNA isolation from Gram positive bacteria   Cells were grown in 100-150 ml of 0.5% LBSG and incubated at 30oC for 2-3 days on a 30rpm shaker. The cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Beckman J2-21 centrifuge (7000 rpm; 10 min.) and resuspended  in 10 ml of TE buffer. Lysozyme (1mg ml-1) was added and the tube incubated  at  37oC  for  30-35  min.  0.5  ml  of  10%  SDS  was  added  together  with proteinase  K (0.5 mg ml-1). This was incubated at 55oC for 2 h with occasional inversion. Following the 2 h incubation of DNA in the presence of proteinase K, 0.5 ml of 5M potassium acetate (pH 6.0) was added to the tube, shaken vigorously for 10 seconds and placed on ice for 10 min. This was centrifuged (15 000 rpm; 10 min.) and the  viscous  supernatant  transferred  to a  50  Ti  tube.  This was  spun  in  an  angled ultracentrifuge rotor for 45-60 min. at 40 000 rpm. The clear solution was transferred into a sterile tube and 4.4 g cesium chloride added. This was mixed gently by rotating the tube several times till the cesium chloride was completely dissolved. 400 µ l of ethidium  36  bromide  (1%)  was  added  and  swirled  to  mix.  The  refractive  index  was adjusted to 1.391-1.392 (section 2.8.3.1) and the solution transferred into a quick seal tube using a Pasteur pipette. The tube was sealed and spun in a VTi 65.2 horizontal rotor at 45 000 rpm for 16 h.   2.8.2 Genomic DNA isolation from Gram negative bacteria   E. coli MM294-4 was grown in 5 ml LB at 37oC overnight. The following day, 600 µ l of cells were transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and harvested by microfuging (1 min; 13 000 rpm). The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 600 µ l of TE buffer to which lysozyme was added. The suspension was incubated at 37oC for 30 min. After the incubation, 120 µ l of TE-SDS (10% SDS) was added, inverted and left at room temperature for 10 min. Following the addition of 120 µ l 5M potassium acetate (pH 6.0) the tube was mixed vigorously and left on ice for 5 min. The sample was microfuged  (13 000 rpm; 5 min.) at 4oC and the supernatant  transferred  to a sterile  Eppendorf  tube.  Chromosomal   DNA  was  purified  by  a  single  phenol- chloroform extraction and precipitated with 1M NaCl and ethanol. The genomic DNA was dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 100 µ l sterile water.   2.8.3  Large  scale  isolation  of vector  DNA  from  E.  coli  utilizing  cesium  chloride gradient centrifugation (maxi-prep)   E.  coli  MM294-4  cells  carrying  the  vector  were  grown  at 37oC  in 100 ml  of  LB  supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. Alternately, λ MM294-4 was grown at 30oC.  The  culture  was  transferred  to  a  JA10  centrifuge  tube  and  harvested  by pelleting (6000 rpm; 10 min.). The supernatant was then discarded and the cells resuspended in 5ml of solution 1. Thereafter, the mixture was transferred to a JA20 centrifuge  tube  and 10ml  of solution  2 added.  This  was covered  in Parafilm  and mixed gently by inversion – causing lysis of the cells. This was left to stand at room temperature for 15 min. In addition, 7.5 ml of solution 3 was added, the tube covered in Parafilm and shaken vigorously for 15-20 sec. This was placed on ice for 10 min. and  centrifuged  (15  000  rpm;  10  min.)  in  a  pre-chilled  rotor.  Subsequently,  the 37  supernatant was decanted into a new tube and warmed in a 37oC water bath for 5 min.  12  ml  of  isopropanol  was  added,  the  tube  covered  in  Parafilm,  mixed  gently  by inversion and left to stand at room temperature for 5 min. The DNA was precipitated through  centrifugation  (15 000  rpm;  10  min.)  at  room  temperature.  The  resulting pellet was washed with 2ml of ethanol and re-centrifuged (15 000 rpm; 1 min.).  The pellet was dried in a SpeedVac for 20 min. and resuspended in 4.1 ml of TE buffer. The tube was then placed in a 30oC rotating water bath for 2 h to allow the DNA to  dissolve. Afterwards 4.2 g of cesium chloride was added and dissolved by gentle agitation.  This  was  supplemented  with  400 µ l  of  1%  ethidium  bromide  and  the refractive index adjusted to 1.387-1.389 using a refractometer. Using a Pasteur pipette the solution was loaded into a Quickseal tube. This was balanced, sealed and run at 45 000 rpm for 16 h in a L7-55 Beckman ultracentrifuge.    2.8.3.1 Adjustment of refractive index    50 µ l of the DNA supernatant was spread across the glass plate. Adjustments were made   till   two   phases   were   clearly   distinguishable   when   viewed   under   the refractometer.  This was adjusted  further  till the two phases  were  separated  at the intersection of the diagonals. The index number was read off the scale. If the index number was below the expected range, cesium chloride was added (0.1 g of cesium chloride leads to an increase of 1 unit). If the index was too high, TE buffer was added (100 µ l of TE buffer leads to a decrease of 1 unit).   2.8.3.2 Extraction of plasmid band    The Quickseal tube was secured in place by a metal clamp and pierced at the top with a  needle  to  release  the  air  pressure.  A  hypodermic  needle  (1.25  X  38  mm)  was inserted just below the second band (plasmid band) and the DNA gently suctioned into the syringe. This was aliquoted into an Eppendorf tube and subjected to a butanol extraction in order to remove the ethidium bromide. 38  2.8.3.3  Removal  of  ethidium  bromide  following  cesium  chloride  gradient centrifugation   Ethidium bromide was removed by adding 150 µ l of butanol and inverting the tube repeatedly.   The  red  upper   aqueous   phase   (containing   ethidium   bromide)   was discarded  by aliquoting.  Butanol  extraction  was repeated  3-4 times  until  ethidium bromide could no longer be observed in the upper phase. The DNA was precipitated by adding 100 µ l of DNA to 200 µ l of sterile water and 700 µ l of absolute ethanol. This was microfuged for 25 min. at 4oC, the supernatant discarded and resultant pellet  dried in a SpeedVac. This was resuspended in sterile water.    2.8.4 Small scale isolation of vector DNA (miniprep) from Gram negative bacteria    Bacterial cells carrying the vector were cultivated in 1ml of LB supplemented with the appropriate  antibiotic.  The cells were harvested by microfuging  for 30 sec and resuspended  in 80 µ l of solution  1. Thereafter,  160µ l of solution 2 was added and mixed gently by inversion. This was left to stand at room temperature for 15 min. Afterwards 120 µ l of solution 3 was added and mixed vigorously by shaking. This was left to stand on ice for 5 min, microfuged in the cold for 5 min. and the supernatant decanted into a sterile Eppendorf tube. The supernatant was warmed at 42oC for 2-10  min. after which 220 µ l of isopropanol was added and gently mixed by inversion. This was  left  to  stand  on  the  bench  for  5  min.  Plasmid  DNA  was  precipitated  by microfuging  for 5 min. The supernatant  was discarded and the pellet washed with 150 µ l of  ethanol.  This  was  microfuged  for  1  min,  the  supernatant  discarded  and carefully blotted onto a paper towel. The pellet was dried in a SpeedVac for 20 min., after which it was resuspended in 100 µ l of sterile water.   2.8.5 Small scale isolation of vector DNA (miniprep) from Gram positive bacteria   Bacterial cultures were inoculated in 1 ml of LBSG containing the appropriate concentration of glycine and grown for 2-3 days. 300 µ l of the cells was transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and harvested by microfuging (13 000 rpm; 1 min.) at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended in 300 µ l of TE buffer to which lysozyme was added. The suspension  was incubated at 37oC for 1 h with regular inversion 39  every  10 min.  Thereafter,  50 µ l of TE-SDS  (10 %)  was added,  mixed  gently  by inversion and left to stand for 10 min. 50 µ l of 5M potassium acetate (pH6.0) was added,  the  tube  mixed  vigourously  and  left  on  ice  for  5  min.  The  sample  was microfuged for 5 min. at 4oC and the supernatant transferred to a sterile Eppendorf  tube. The DNA was subjected to a single phenol-chloroform extraction (section 2.6.3) and precipitated  with 1M NaCl  (section  2.6.1). The DNA was then dried  using a SpeedVac and resuspended in 50 µ l of water.   2.8.6 Plasmid isolation from Streptomyces spp.    The  plasmid  pIJ702  was  harvested  from  S.  lividans  66,  using  the  protocol  of Hopwood et al. (1985). The S. lividans culture was grown in 500 ml of 0.5% LBSG supplemented   with   50   µ g/ml   of   thiostrepton   for   2   days   and   harvested   by centrifugation (10 000 rpm; 5 min.). Once the supernatant was discarded, the bacteria were resuspended in 5 ml lysozyme solution. This was incubated for 30 min. at 37oC.  After mixing gently with a glass pipette, 2.5 ml of 0.3M alkaline SDS was added. This was immediately mixed by suctioning with a pipette and incubated further for 20 min.  at  70oC.  When  cooled  to  room  temperature,  the  suspension  was  mixed  by shaking and 800 µ l of acid phenol/chloroform added. Following agitation on a vortex to  mix  the  phases,  the  solution  was  centrifuged  (10 000  rpm;  10  min.),  and  the supernatant transferred to a new tube. 700 µ l of 3M unbuffered sodium acetate and 7 ml  isopropanol  was  then  added.  This  was  mixed  by  inversion,  kept  at  room temperature for 5 min. and centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, the tube re-centrifuged for 20 sec. and all the liquid removed. The pellet was dissolved in 500 µ l TE buffer and tapped to mix. 50 µ l 3M unbuffered sodium acetate and 250 µ l neutral  phenol/chloroform  was added,  vortexed  and spun for 5 min.  The aqueous phase was transferred  to an Eppendorf  tube, 500 µ l isopropanol  added, mixed and centrifuged for 2 min. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet dissolved in 1 ml TE buffer. This was transferred  to a centrifuge  tube and a further 4 ml TE buffer added together with 250 µ l 100mM spermine-HCl. After being mixed, the tube was kept at room temperature for 5 min., centrifuged for 10 min., decanted, re-centrifuged for 20 sec. and all the liquid removed. 0.3M sodium acetate + 10mM MgCl2 and 7 ml ethanol were added to the pellet, tapped and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Again the solution was centrifuged for 10 min., the supernatant removed and re- 40  centrifuged for 20 sec. and all the liquid decanted in preparation for cesium-chloride gradient centrifugation as in section 2.8.3.   2.9 Transformations    2.9.1 E. coli calcium-chloride mediated transformation    200  µ l  of  a  MM294-4  or  λ  MM294-4  preculture  were  added  to  20  ml  of  LB  containing 0.5% glucose. This was grown with vigorous aeration for 1 h 45 min. at 37oC or alternately 30oC for the λ lysogen. Cells were cooled in an ice water slurry for  5  min.  before  pelleting  (10 000  rpm;  5  min.)  in  a  pre-chilled  JA20  Beckman centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and cells resuspended in half the original volume (10 ml) of transformation buffer. This was left on ice for 15 min. and pelleted (10 000 rpm; 5 min.). The supernatant was again discarded and gently resuspended in one-fifteenth the original volume (1.33 ml) of transformation buffer. This was left on ice for a minimum of 2 h DNA ligations were placed on ice prior to being added to 100 µ l of competent E. coli cells. This was incubated on ice for 10 min. to facilitate diffusion.  The  cells  were  then  heat  shocked  at 44oC  for  90 seconds.  0.5 ml pre- warmed  LB  was  added  to  each  tube  and  incubated  for  1  h  at  37oC  or  room temperature for λ lysogen. Cells were then spread onto antibiotic containing plates and incubated overnight at 37oC (MM 294-4) or 30oC (λ MM294-4).   2.9.2  Rhodococcus  spp.  polyethylene-glycol  (PEG)  mediated  protoplast transformation   Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1 was grown in LBSG liquid media (2% glycine) for 2 days at 30oC. 1 ml of the culture was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and the cells harvested by microfuging for (10 000 rpm; 30 sec.) This was washed in 1 ml B buffer, microfuged for a further 30 seconds, the supernatant decanted and resuspended in 1 ml B buffer containing lysozyme. The mixture was incubated in a 37oC water bath for  1.5 h with inversion  every 10 min. Fifteen min. prior to the end of the 1.5 h incubation period, 0.5 g of PEG granules were sterilized under UV for 10 min. and P buffer prepared. The PEG was then dissolved in P buffer by vigorous vortexing. After incubation the protoplast suspension was microfuged for 10 seconds, washed in 1 ml 41  B buffer and resuspended in 500 µ l P buffer. 100 µ l of the protoplast suspension was aliquoted into Eppendorf  tubes and the appropriate  volume of DNA added to each tube. This was left to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. An equal volume of P- PEG buffer was added and the tube contents mixed by bubbling air through to mix the two  phases.  The  contents  of  the  tubes  were  spotted  onto  regeneration  plates  and spread  using  a  glass  pipette.  The  plates  were  incubated  at  30oC  for  13  h  and underlaid  with chloramphenicol  (30µ g/ml). This was then incubated  at 30oC for 5 days.   2.9.2.1 Antibiotic underlaying    A metal spatula was heat sterilized over a Bunsen burner flame and allowed to cool. This was used to raise the agar off the base of the plate and 220 µ l of a 4mg/ml chloramphenicol stock solution added beneath. The antibiotic was evenly spread by rotating the plate while holding the spatula at the centre of the plate base.   2.9.3 Streptomyces spp. PEG mediated transformation    Refer to section 2.2 page 281 for modified Rhodococcus spp. transformation protocol.    2.9.4 Heterologous expression of genes in Rhodococcus spp.    The gene fragments were ligated into the unique BglII site of the Rhodococcus spp. replicon vector pDA71. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli MM294-4 using the CaCl2  mediated transformation procedure (section 2.9.1). Random colonies were  screened  for the presence  of inserts.  Subsequently,  the gene  orientation  was determined  by means  of  restriction  analysis.  The  appropriate  recombinant  vectors were transformed into R. erythropolis SQ1 via PEG-mediated transformation (section 2.9.2). To confirm the presence of the recombinant vector in the Rhodococcus spp. clones (and rule out the possibility of these being antibiotic resistant mutants), random colonies  were  chosen  and  the  vector  DNA  reisolated  using  the  Gram  positive miniprep protocol (section 2.8.5). This was again transformed into E. coli spp., miniprepped, the DNA digested and analyzed on a gel. 42  2.9.5 Heterologous expression of genes in Mycobacterium spp.    The gene fragments were ligated into the unique BamHI site of the Mycobacterium spp. replicon vectors, pNV18 and pNV19. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli MM294-4 using the CaCl2  mediated transformation procedure (section 2.9.1). Random colonies were screened for the presence of inserts. Subsequently, the gene orientation   was  determined   by  means   of  restriction   analysis.   The  appropriate recombinant vectors were transformed into M. smegmatic mc2 155 via electroporation  (section 2.1 page 253). To confirm the presence  of the recombinant  vector in the Mycobacterium spp. clones, random colonies were chosen and the vector DNA reisolated using the Gram positive miniprep protocol (section 2.8.5). This was again transformed into E. coli spp., miniprepped, the DNA digested and analyzed on a gel.   2.10 Genomic libraries    2.10.1 Construction and screening of genomic libraries    Genomic DNA was extracted as described in section 2.8.1. This was digested with several restriction enzymes namely: HindIII, PstI, BglII, BamHI, Bsp1431 (Sau3A), PsuI (XhoII), KpnI, XbaI and Mph1103I (NsiI). Those enzymes which cut the DNA optimally  (when viewed on an agarose  gel) were selected  for library construction. Bacterial DNA was digested with BglII and the genomic fragments ligated into the vector pLR591 (section 2.6.4) and transformed into E. coli MM294-4. Transformants were  selected  on  ampicillin  plates  (100µ g/ml)  and  at  this  stage  a  rudimentary statistical analysis done to determine the number of clones required to constitute a complete genomic library (section 2.10.4). The clones were then pooled as in section 2.10.2.  Recombinant  vector  DNA was isolated  using the cesium chloride  gradient centrifugation procedure (section 2.8.3) and transformed into S. lividans TK23 using PEG mediated transformation (section 2.9.3). S. lividans transformants were patched onto selective  dye agar plates containing  0.1% glucose  and 30 µ g/ml thiostrepton (section 2.10.3). These plates were incubated at 30oC and routinely analyzed for clear  zone formation around colonies. 43  2.10.2 Pooling of clones    Once  the  recombinant  vectors  were  transformed,  transformants  were  collected  by adding 2 ml LB to each plate and running a sterile glass pipette across the plate to loosen the colonies. Once the colonies were resuspended in the LB, this was suctioned and aliquoted into a sterile Schott bottle. The E. coli library was stored at -20oC.   2.10.3 Patching of colonies    A paper grid block numbered from 1- 100 was placed beneath the screening plate. Using a sterile toothpick, the centre of the colony was stabbed and streaked across a single grid block.  This was incubated and the plate monitored daily for any signs of a clear zone surrounding a colony.   2.10.4 Calculation of number of clones needed to comprise a gene bank    Ten random colonies were picked from the representative genomic library and grown overnight in the presence of ampicillin. These were miniprepped and digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme to release the insert. In addition, this was run on an agarose gel and the insert size estimated in relation to the standard molecular weight marker.  The  number  of clones  carrying  inserts  was also noted.  Calculations  were based on the following standard formula: N =ln (1-p) / ln (1- a/b), with the probability of finding a clone taken as 95% and the genome size as 8.7 Mbp. The size used was based on the sequencing of the entire genome of S. coelicolor A3(2) which yielded a chromosome length of 8.7 million base pairs.   N: number of clones required to represent a complete genomic library p: probability a: average insert size (total insert sizes / no. of clones tested)  b: genome size 44  2.11 Strain characterization    2.11.1 Gram staining    Strains  were  grown  in LB and harvested  for use  in gram  staining  once  they had reached exponential phase. A drop of the culture was placed onto a slide and air dried. The bacteria were fixed to the slide by passing it once through a flame. This was flooded with crystal violet and left to stand for 1 min. This was followed by gentle rinsing under tap water. Iodine was added and again left to stand for 1 min. This was again rinsed with tap water. A few drops of decolorizer was added and immediately rinsed. The slide was flooded with the counter-stain safranin and left for a minute. This was rinsed and the slide examined under a microscope.   2.11.2 Light microscopy    Slides of gram stained cells were examined using 400X magnification and the images recorded with a digital camera.   2.12 Monitoring of azoreductase activity using liquid assays    2.12.1 The effect of pH on dye decolorization    This was examined in the pH range 6-8 in a 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer (Table  5.4.1 page 315). The dye (10 µg/ml) was added to 5 ml of the appropriate phosphate buffer with no additional carbon source and incubated for a week. The decolorization percentage was determined as described in section 2.5.   2.12.2 The effect of temperature on dye decolorization   This was examined in the range 20-50oC in minimal media broth supplemented with dye (10 µg/ml) and 0.25% glucose. These were incubated for a week and the optical density  readings  taken  as  in  section  2.5  used  to  determine  the  decolorization percentage.  45  2.12.3 The effect of carbon and nitrogen sources on dye decolorization    A range of carbon or nitrogen sources (0.25%) were added to 5 ml of minimal media with dye (10 µg/ml) and incubated for 2 h and 48 h for crystal violet and amido black decolorization  experiments  respectively.  The nitrogen sources tested include; yeast extract, peptone and a combination of both and carbon sources include: glucose, glycerol and starch.   2.12.4 Acclimatization    The strain was incubated  in minimal media containing 10 µ g/ml of the dye. Once decolorization occurred the culture was pelleted and transferred into 20 µ g/ml of dye with fresh media. This process was repeated using 10 µ g/ml increments till the strain could no longer decolorize the dye efficiently.   2.12.5 Bioabsorption study    The cells were grown  in LB till a dense culture  was obtained.  The mycelia  were washed  in sterile  water and autoclaved  at 120oC  for 20  min.  in order to kill  the bacteria. The mycelial mass was used as organic material source to test for bioabsorption of the dyes to the bacterial cellular wall.   2.12.6 Detoxification    The decolorized supernatant was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and microfuged in order to pellet the cells. The supernatant  was then collected and passed through a sterile 0.25 µ m filter. Five ml of this was transferred to a test tube and 5-10 µ l of a stationary phase E. coli culture added. Similarly, the controls included the use of non- supplemented  minimal  media  and  minimal  media  to  which  glucose  (0.25%)  was added. Again an appropriate volume of E. coli cells was added to each test tube and all were incubated for 2 h. on a rotating wheel at 37oC. Following the incubation, a  serial  dilution  was  carried  out  and  plated  onto  LA  media.  This  was  incubated 46  overnight and the colony forming units per ml determined the following day using the equation:   CFU/ml = number of colonies x dilution factor / volume spread (ml)    2.13 Assessment of degradative products    2.13.1 Thin layer chromatography (TLC)    The decolorized supernatant  was separated from the cells by microfuging  (10 000 rpm; 30 sec). This was spotted onto the TLC plate (Kieselgel 60 F254) approximately 1.5 cm from the base of the plate. Once dry the plate was placed into a glass chamber  containing  a solution  of 90  isopropanol:  1 glacial  acetic  acid:  9 water.  This  was allowed to run till the mobile phase was 1 cm from the plate end. This was dried and the Rf values recorded. Rf  was calculated as the distance of the band (mm) divided by the distance traveled by the solvent front (mm).    2.14 Bioinformatics    2.14.1 Nucleotide and protein sequence matches  Protein  and  DNA  sequences  were  matched  using  the  blastx  and  nucleotide  blast facilitates of NCBI PubMed. Default parameters were used in both cases. The partial 16S rRNA PCR products were aligned against those in the database and the highest percentage similarity recorded.   2.14.2 Phylogenetic tree construction  Trees were constructed  with Blast Tree  View using the neighbour-joining  method with a maximum sequence difference of 0.85 and Grishin distance.  2.14.3 Enzyme analysis  2.14.3.1 Tertiary structures The  NCBI  PubMed  structure  database  was  used for the  structural  analysis  of the proteins. 47  3. Results    3.1 Isolation and taxonomic characterization of relevant microorganisms    3.1.1 Collection of soil samples    Sixteen  soil  samples  collected  from  regions  in America,  Europe  and Africa  were originally screened for the presence of rubber degrading strains (see section 3.1 page 162).  Soil  samples  were  collected  from  various  environments;  a  tyre  scrap  yard, compost, arid dry soil and soil alongside a riverbank to name but a few. From these twenty-six isolates were purified using an enrichment technique (see section 2.2.1 page 157).   
     Fig. 3.1: Illustration of regions where soil samples were collected    3.1.2 Microscopic studies    Genus  identification  relied  on  morphological  characteristics  observed  using  Gram staining in conjunction with light microscopy [Fig. 3.2]. All strains were mycelial with the exception of strains YeoE (Gram positive rods) and HZ (Gram negative rods).  48

       3.3 Screening of decolorizing bacteria on dye supplemented agar plates    All twenty-six strains isolated from the soil were tested alongside fifteen other known strains  from the bacterial  culture  collection.  Four  carbon  supplementations  (0.5%) were chosen to work with; glucose,  succinate,  tween 20 and tween  80.   Colonies

 around which zones of clearing were apparent were recorded as dye decolorizers. See Table  6.2  page  295  for  table  specifying  the  dyes  decolorized  by  each  strain. Tartrazine, amaranth and fast green could not be decolorized  by any of the strains tested,  even  in  the  presence  of  additional  carbon  sources.  The  dyes  orange  II, eriochrome T, amido black, biebrich scarlet and bismarck brown could only be decolorized by certain strains once carbon sources were present [Fig. 3.5].

For visual clarity these results are represented in three different figures. Notably, no change in the dye only + carbon source control was noted.     Overall, including succinate in the dye media offered little improvement over the non- supplemented   media.   Predictably,   the   inclusion   of   glucose   greatly   improved 60  decolorization. Unexpectedly, the addition of tween 20 augmented the range of dyes decolorized. This was especially noticeable in relation to amido black, orange II and biebrich scarlet; in which a three to four fold increase was apparent [Fig. 3.6 and Fig. 3.7].

   Fig. 3.7: Decolorization observed on (A) tween 20 and (B) tween 80 supplemented amido black replicated plates   A  single  zone  of  clearing  was  observed  around  bacteria  capable  of  decolorizing specific dyes. An exception was strain HZ which produced two zones; a condensed inner zone and clear outer zone similar to the other bacteria [Fig. 3.8]. Although the isolate did not degrade the dye, evident by adsorption to the bacterial cell wall, I looked for a possible explanation for two zones.       Clear outer zone   Bacterial colony    Condensed inner zone    Fig. 3.8: Inner and outer zone around bacterial colony HZ    Of the forty three isolates tested, strain SY6 was chosen for further characterization studies based on its ability to decolorize crystal violet, amido black, brilliant green, janus green as well as orange II and biebrich scarlet in the presence of surfactants. 62  
  3.4 Decolorization study in liquid culture by strain SY6    The addition of tween 20 in liquid media in stark contrast to its effect on agar media reduced  decolorization.  The reason  for this is unclear.  Thus,  for all liquid culture studies glucose (0.25%) was added. A decision was made to focus on the azo dye, amido  black.  Prolonged  incubation  (just  under  two  days)  of  strain  SY6  in  liquid minimal media containing amido black led to a distinct color change from blue to violet  [Fig.  3.9  (A)  and  (B)].  Comparatively,  brilliant  green  was  decolorized  to colorless derivatives in under an hour [Fig. 3.9 (C) and (D)].  
  Fig. 3.9: Decolorization of dyes (10 µg/ml) (A) amido black, (B) amido black decolorized by strain SY6, (C) brilliant green and (D) brilliant green decolorized by strain SY6   3.5 Creation of a genomic library    In order to isolate the gene/s responsible,  a genomic library was created. Genomic DNA  was  isolated  using  cesium-chloride  gradient  centrifugation.  Aliquots  of  this DNA  were  incubated  with  the  following  enzymes:  HindIII,  PstI,  BglII,  BamHI, Bsp1431 (Sau3A), PsuI (XhoII), KpnI, XbaI and Mph1103I (NsiI) and run on 0.4% agarose gels to determine which restriction enzyme yielded an optimal fragment size range. The digestion of A. orientalis SY6 DNA with BglII yielded an average DNA fragment size of 3830 bp [Fig 3.10]. Calculations estimated that less than 7000 clones were needed to ensure a high probability of containing the gene of interest.     63  
  Fig 3.10: Inserts released from clones of A. orientalis SY6 library. Calculations were based on the following standard formula: No. of clones =ln (1-p) / ln (1- a/b), with the probability of finding a clone taken as 95% and the genome size as 8.7 Mbp. The size used was based on the sequencing of the entire genome of S. coelicolor A3(2) which had a length of 8.7 million base pairs, about twice the size of many other bacterial genomes (Redenbach et al., 1996).   Once the actinomycete  DNA was digested  with the appropriate  restriction  enzyme and ligated to vector pLR591 (Streptomyces spp. replicon vector), the DNA was transformed into an intermediate E. coli host using calcium chloride mediated transformation  to concentrate  and  purify  the  DNA.  See  section  2.1  page  281  for construction of vector pLR591.   Recombinant vector DNA was re-isolated from the E. coli pooled library consisting of approximately 40 000 clones by means of a large scale maxi-prep and transformed into  S.  lividans  TK23  using  PEG  mediated  transformation,  for  the  purpose  of screening.  Unfortunately,  a  Streptomyces  spp.  host  strain  lacking  the  ability  to decolorize amido black was not available to us. However, it was evident that strain TK23 was only capable of azo dye decolorization when at a high cell density. Since patching  of the clones  entails  the transfer  of a small  bacterial  inoculum  onto  the screening media, expression of the native gene was not detected. 5000	  bp	  1500	  bp	  500	  bp	   
  
  3.6 Screening for the azo dye decolorizing gene on amido black plates    Approximately  5000  clones  carrying  A.  orientalis  SY6  DNA  were  patched  onto selective dye media. A single clone displaying a zone of clearing was detected [Fig. 3.11].

A restriction profile was mapped using the enzymes seen in the diagram for the purpose of subcloning and subsequent testing of the minimal DNA required for phenotypic expression [Fig. 3.13]. The recombinant vector was named pAM1 and the clone SlivAM1. Cloning of the XhoII fragments revealed that the larger 2800 bp region harbored the decolorization gene. A parallel cloning experiment revealed that 1600 bp of the aforementioned region was not required for amido black break down. Reasonably, the gene of interest was mapped to a 1200 bp region.

  3.8 Sequencing of pAM1 insert    Sequencing of the 4500 bp gene fragment revealed seven open reading frames [Fig.  3.14]. From the subcloning  results three of the predicted  proteins  (within the first  1700 bp) were eliminated. Thus, four potential protein candidates remained namely ORF’s D, E, F and G. Subsequently, further subcloning revealed ORF’s E, F, and G were  non-essential.  Thus,  ORF  D encoding  a conserved  hypothetical  protein  was believed to be the gene responsible for decolorization.

ORF D showed a 60 % sequence identity match to the DsbD gene of S. roseum. A phylogenetic tree was constructed  to infer  the  relationship  between  ORF D  in  A.  orientalis  and homologues within other species. ORF D is closely related to DsbD homologues of A. mediterranei and C. acidiphila (a mycelia actinomycete) forming a cluster, but only distantly related to those in other species.

  3.10 Characterization of optimal pH, temperature and carbon source utilization of enzyme   Whole cell assays were conducted to determine the optimal parameters of activity for this enzyme. A temperature of 37oC led to the highest decolorization dropping rapidly with either a 10oC increment  or decrease [Fig. 3.16]. The lack of activity at 50oC potentially suggests weak thermostability. Notably, since the host strain possessed a native ability to decolorize the dye this activity could not be separated from the activity of the cloned pAM1 gene.  In all graphs error bars represent standard deviation from experiments carried out via. inter-experimental duplication.   3.10.1 Liquid assay determining optimal temperature profile     30   25   20   15   10   5   0 10  20  30  40  50  60  Temperature (C)     Fig. 3.16: Decolorization at different temperatures 70  Decolorization (%)

Correspondingly, various  carbon  sources  were  tested  to establish  which would  be most efficient. Glucose was the best supplement resulting in 45 % decolorization and increased cell biomass [Fig. 3.18]. 71

Results indicated that its activity was highly restricted to amido black [Table 3.6].

However, the choice to use Streptomyces spp. as the host for screening purposes was due to the ease of detection of the phenotype since the mycelia extend beyond the immediate periphery of the colony.    3.12 Expression of pAM1 in R. erythropolis SQ1  R. erythropolis SQ1 does not have the ability to degrade amido black hence the expression of the gene fragment in this background host proved pAM1 habored a biodegradative ability. Hence, vector pAM1 was transformed into Rhodococcus spp. (clone SQ1AM1) and the decolorization of various dyes monitored. It was found once again that its expression did not have an affect on other dyes [Table 3.7].

A two-fold decrease in colony forming units was detected when compared to the glucose supplemented control, indicating inhibition thus suggesting partial detoxification of the dye [Fig. 3.20].   Additionally, the morphology of E. coli when incubated   in the  presence   of  the  decolorized   dye  was  viewed  under  a  light microscope. No dramatic change in structure was noted.   8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0 M inimal m e dia De color ize d SQ1AM 1 supernatant me dia  Fig. 3.20: Effect of decolorized supernatant on the growth of  E. coli  M inim al m e dia + glucose75  3.14 Influence of bioabsorption on decolorization    This experiment was conducted in line with Robinson and coworkers (2001) suggestion that the adsorption of dyes onto an organic substrate and microbial treatment thereafter would be a good bioremediation strategy.  Thus, live A. orientalis SY6 cells were incubated with live S. coelicolor A3(2) or dead S. coelicolor A3(2) cells. The SY6 and A3(2)   strains consortium led to the additional breakdown of Amaranth and Orange II. The incubation of strain SY6 with dead A3(2) cells  led to the  removal  of  Scarlet  from  the media.  No dye however  was removed  due  to bioabosorption onto the dead mycelial mass. The adsorption was anticipated to occur due to the interaction of the charge on the cell wall and dye.

Discussion    Interest in the family of nocardioform actinomycetes lies in the extraordinary primary and secondary metabolism  possessed by this group, with members involved in the ability  to  synthesize   antibiotics  or  antimicrobial   peptides,  break  down  rubber, mineralize dyes and produce phytases (Goszczynski,  1994; Jendrossek et al., 1997a; Walsh, 2003). This family remains an untapped fountain of valuable genes, enzymes and pathways (Gurung et al., 2009). Studies have continuously demonstrated that this group possess exceptional attributes; focus was placed on one of the lesser acknowledged features of actinomycetes; in particular azo dye decolorization.   Soil samples were collected from geographically and environmentally diverse regions covering five of the seven continents. This was done with the expectation of isolating novel strains and subsequently novel genes and compounds (Gurung et al., 2009). The original enrichment for these strains was through the use of latex rubber which led to the isolation of twenty-nine strains, and the biased selectivity of twenty-two Streptomyces spp. The identification of nine of these in contrast to what was expected gave high percentages of similarity to known species. Studies conducted on Streptomyces spp. for their ability to break down dyes are surprisingly limited (McMullan et al., 2001). This encouraged the screening of these strains on sixteen dyes.   The results of the plate decolorization assays showed that many strains were restricted in their capacity to decolorize either the triphenylmethane or azo dyes. The inability of any of the tested strains to decolorize  the triphenylmethane  dye, fast green and sulfonated dye, tartrazine was not unexpected. To the best of my knowledge, literature on the bacterial break down of fast green is non-existent and with regard to tartrazine very limited. Just one article detailed  the  reduction  of  tartrazine  by  Proteus  vulgaris  by  means  of  a  FMN- flavoprotein  (Roxon et al., 1967). Their work showed that this dye could only be utilized by older cells due to more lenient cell permeability of the cells at this phase.   The break down of amaranth however is reasonably common in the literature. Azoreductases  from a Kerstersia  spp., Sphingomonas  spp., Pseudomonas  spp. and Staphylococcus  spp. strains have been characterized  in the degradation  of this dye 77  (Vijaykumar et al., 2007; Kudlich et al., 1997; Nachiyar and Rajakumar, 2005; Chen et  al.,  2005).  Notably,  with  the  exception  of  Staphylococcus  aureus,  the  other bacterial strains were Gram negative. Nevertheless, this information is not enough to deduce  that  amaranth  biodegradation  occurs  more  frequently  in  Gram  negative bacteria. In this study since just two Gram negative strains were carried (out of forty-three strains tested) it is difficult to make a comparison between the two groups. The failure to detect this ability could simply be attributed to the selection of strains; the majority of which are Streptomyces species. To the best of our knowledge no azoreductase has ever  been  isolated  from  this  genus,  however  a  potential  azoreductase  has  been identified in S. coelicolor by means of the genome sequencing project. This reasoning could be applied in parallel to the small number of bacteria capable of mineralizing other azo dyes in this study. Other dyes difficult to degrade included the azo dyes eriochrome  T,  orange  II,  amido  black,  biebrich  scarlet,  ponceau  S  and  bismarck brown, all of which could not be decolorized unless an additional carbon source was added. In particular, orange II and ponceau S, like amaranth are fairly common in the literature.  Alternately,  this  might  be  explained  by  the  choice  of  media  used  by researchers for the screening of dye decolorization. Notably, minimal media used in much of the literature contains  yeast extract,  peptone  or trace elements  (Grekova- Vasileva et al., n.d.; Hu., 1994). The minimal media used within this study contains the most basic components;  namely phosphates,  a nitrogen  source (in the form of ammonium chloride) and the dye serving as the main carbon source.   Glucose reportedly acts as a source of electrons when consumed by microorganisms and was found to favorably increase decolorization and growth of most strains tested. An exception to this was the supplementation of janus green which led to a decrease in the number of strains decolorizing the dye. No evidence in the literature of glucose repressing azo dye decolorization could be found, thus the reason for this occurrence is unclear. Harazono and Nakamura  (2005) described an increase in decolorization potential  upon  the  addition  of  surfactants  to  a  liquid  dye  mixture  containing  the fungus P. sordida. It was checked whether the same pattern would be manifested with these strains, using tween 80 and 20. Tween 80 is an anionic surfactant derived from an unsaturated fatty acid, while tween 20, a non-ionic surfactant contains saturated fatty  acid  (Harazono  and  Nakamura,  2005).  The  addition  of  tween  20  onto  dye containing  plates  in this study  clearly  improved  the  number  of strains  capable  of 78  decolorization  while  the action  of  tween  80  was  less  pronounced.  The prominent zones surrounding colonies on tween 20 supplemented plates allowed us to tentatively propose an increase in enzyme yield.   Reese and Maguire (1968) reported a similar occurrence when conducting a comprehensive study into the ability of surfactants to stimulate  enzyme  production  in fungi.  These  researchers  made  several  interesting observations, which include a general increase in enzyme production in strains which initially produced small quantities of enzyme, yet insignificant increases for strains which were good enzyme producers. The mode of action was believed to be an interaction with the cell membrane, resulting in a release of the enzymes. A closer monitoring of different enzymes within the same host showed that tween 80 could result in the selective inhibition of some enzymes and enhancement of others, proving that  a  complex  interaction   is  involved.  I hypothesized   that  the  detection  of decolorizing strains only observed in the presence of tween 20 yet not with tween 80 could be accredited  to superior protein stabilization  by the latter providing  greater protection  to the enzyme/s  once released  into the media (Chou et al., 2005). This consequence brings a new dimension in this work suggesting that azoreductases are widespread amongst Streptomyces species, yet go unnoticed due to their low concentrations. Noticeably,  Streptomyces   spp.   were   able   to  readily   decolorize   congo   red,   a structurally  complex  dye  which  contains  two  azo  bonds  and  polyaromatic  and sulfonated groups. Yet, the structurally simpler dye, orange II which has a single azo bond and sulfonated group was not cleaved at all. It is obvious from the literature that azoreductase   action   is   variable   among   strains.   For   instance   Kerstersia   spp. decolorized dyes carrying sulfonated groups on either side of the azo bond to a higher extent than dyes which carried a single sulfonated  group.  This is in contrast  with decolorization reported by Sphingomonas species. Evidently, greater structural complexity of a dye does not signify greater difficulty in its breakdown. Instead it has been found to be dependent on several factors namely, the type, position and number of functional groups. Additionally, the presence of phenolic, amino, acetoamido and 2-methyoxyphenol   groups  on  the  ring  were  found  to  lead  to  an  increase  in biodegradation (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999).   An interesting  phenomenon  was  noticed  on the dye  supplemented  plates  carrying Methylibium fulvum HZ. Two concentric zones surrounded the colony opposed to a single  zone  as  seen  with  all  the  other  bacteria.  This  can  be  explained  by  the 79  electrostatic interaction of the enzyme with the dye. Crystal violet is a basic dye; thus the release of a basic polymer into the media creates a clear zone, however the release of an acidic polymer causes the dye to condense (Nishikawa and Ogawa, 2002). In principle, this suggests that two enzymes are being released into the media by this strain,  which  from  the zones  can be interpreted  as a low  molecular  weight  basic enzyme (due to its diffusion furthest from the colony) and higher molecular weight acidic enzyme, creating the inner condensed zone.   The  range  of  dyes  decolorized  by  strain  SY6  and  the  detection  of  strong  zones suggesting potent enzyme activity made it apparent that this isolate demanded further attention. Basic characterization tests revealed that this strain was an aerobic, Gram positive, filamentous  bacterium which formed a ‘crusty’ colony on complex media and gave rise to fragmented mycelia in liquid broth. However, its atypical antibiotic profile  set  it  apart  from  the  other  Streptomyces  spp.  strains.  Its  resistance  to streptomycin,  thiostrepton  and  rifampicin  are  not  common  features  of this  genus. Sequencing  of  the  16S  rRNA  led  to  98%  identification  to  both  Amycolatopsis japonica and Amycolatopsis orientalis. These strains are easily distinguishable based on the aerial spore and diffusible pigment color (Tan et al., 2006). A. japonica has white aerial spores, releasing a dark olive brown pigment with a deep yellow-brown reverse color, while A. orientalis has light blue aerial spores, releases a light olive brown pigment with an orange-yellow reverse color (Tan et al., 2006). Based on this rudimentary assessment strain SY6 was identified as A. orientalis.   The majority of strains tested were capable of decolorizing dyes within a single class. A. orientalis  SY6 was unique in the fact that it crossed this boundary,  capable  of degrading diazo, azo and triphenylmethane dyes. To our knowledge no Amycolatopsis species has ever been implicated in azo dye decolorization and thus encouraged our pursuit of the gene/s involved in this particular strain.   One  clone  exhibiting  a  zone  of  clearing  was  acquired  from  a  genomic  library. Analysis  of the insert  revealed  a match  to a conserved  hypothetical  protein  in A. mediterranei,  which  was  unhelpful  in  determining  the  function  of  the  associated enzyme. The hypothetical protein however, matched a cytochrome c biogenesis transmembrane  region  (DsbD)  in  S.  roseum.  The  Dsb  (disulfide  bond  formation) family of enzymes serves the same function as the protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) 80  found in eukaryotes (Missiakas et al., 1995). These enzymes play an important role in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds that is crucial to the stability of many proteins (Missiakas et al., 1995). The pathway within Gram negative bacteria has been deciphered; DsbA is responsible for the introduction of disulfide bonds into synthesized  proteins,  an action which causes it to become  reduced  (Katzen  et al., 2002). It is reoxidized by means of DsbB which itself is oxidized by quinones within the cytoplasmic membrane (Chung et al., 2000). Within this highly oxidized environment  certain  enzymes  must  be  maintained  in  a  reduced  form  in  order  to function.  Thioredoxin  reductase  and  cytoplasmic  thioredoxin  serve  as an  electron source with electrons transferred to DsbD which is responsible for the reduction of the disulfide isomerases DsbC and DsbG (Chung et al., 2000). Missiakas and colleagues conducted  a  detailed  analysis  on  DsbD  activity  in  E.  coli  and  found  that  non- functional   mutants   were   defective   in  sulfide   bond  formation   and  caused   the isomerases to accumulate in an oxidized form. Hence, they were able to deduce that this enzyme acts as a reductase and is important in maintaining a balance of oxidized and reduced substrates.  This is not the first study to link a reductase  involved  in another role to azo dye degradation.  Mugerfeld et al. (2009) linked a putative azoreductase  to heavy metal resistance in Shewanella species. Crystallography  studies verified the presence of a NAD(P)H binding pocket in E. coli AzoR, P. aeruginosa paAzoR1 and E. faecalis AzoA (Punj and John, 2009). This is found to be a frequent feature amongst azoreductases  identified  thus far. No NAD(P)H,  FAD or FMN binding  sites were found to occur in DsbD, however since the electrons are received from an external source for the purpose of reduction, the presene of these sites is not necessary.   From the phylogenetic tree it was evident that DsbD was not closely related to other sequences within the database. Of the environmental isolates tested eleven Streptomycetes  were able to degrade the sulfonated diazo dye. Yet on the tree, the closest enzyme matches from Streptomyces species were clustered separately from the A. orientalis enzyme. It is possible that this group possesses another gene for amido black biodegradation. This was further evidenced since no gene with a highly similar sequence was found in the fully sequenced genome of S. coelicolor, also an amido black decolorizer.   81  Optimal temperature of the enzyme was 37oC which corresponds to many studies in the literature, however the pH showed a slight deviation with optimal activity at 6.5 rather than 7.0, which is commonly reported. Gracibacillus spp., B. cereus and P.aeruginosa enzyme activity were all optimal at pH 7.0 (Uddin et al., 2007; Pricelius et al., 2007; Nachiyar and Rajakumar, 2005). Glucose, followed closely by maltose proved to be the most efficient carbon sources tested. Logically, sucrose was the least efficient  since  S.  lividans  is  incapable  of  utilizing  this  due  to lack  of  sucrase  or invertase activity (Santamaria et al., 2002). The addition of excess nitrogen, in the form of yeast extract combined with peptone negatively influenced dye removal. Liu et al. (2009) showed that a combination  of yeast extract and glucose  led to 70 % decolorization  in less than 2 hours and took longer  when  these  components  were added individually.   The range of decolorization by pAM1 in the Streptomycete host was limited to amido black. This was further verified when transformed into R. erythropolis SQ1. The dyes tested  which  fall  into the  same  class  as amido  black  are  congo  red  and  biebrich scarlet. It can only be hypothesized why these dyes were not reduced. It is probable that the presence of the two benzene rings in biebrich scarlet and two naphthalene rings in congo red prevented their decolorization. Nigam and coworkers (1996) found that azo dyes with a hydroxy or amino group, such as amido black are degraded more easily than those carrying a methyl, methoxy, sulfo or nitro groups.   Useful dye degrading isolates should be capable of completely breaking down the dye to non-toxic components. Decolorization is only an indication of the conversion of the chromophore,  thus the monitoring of toxicity reduction is important. By testing the rate of growth of E. coli in decolorized supernatant it was established that only partial detoxification  occurred. Unfortunately,  no literature exists on the biodegradation of amido black, thus no enzymes have been identified nor the biodegradative pathway uncovered. For these reasons it was not possible to determine what toxic end-product is being produced.   He et al. (2004) compared the results between immobilized and free cells and a found  99 % color removal in 6 hours for immobilized cells whereas 90 % decolorization was  achieved  after  24  hours  with  free  cells.  Cells  are  normally  immobilized  on polyvinyl alcohol beads. For employment of bacteria for use in bioreactors it is often 82  beneficial to immobilize them on a solid substrate. Cell immobilization was mimicked by spotting SlivAM1 bacteria onto agar pellets and incubating them in amido black. In comparison to freely suspended cells the immobilized cells took longer to degrade the azo dye (data not shown).  It is possible  that since only part of the cells were exposed to the dye (since the substrate mycelia were buried in the agar pellet) that this hampered the release of the enzyme.   Robinson et al. (2001) suggested that the best strategy would be to first adsorb the dyes  onto  a  substrate  in  order  to  concentrate  them  and  afterwards  treat  them microbially. The decision was made to check whether this would prove to be a useful strategy by adsorbing the dyes onto dead S. coelicolor cells and subsequently treating them with strain A. orientalis SY6. The live S. coelicolor and A. orientalis consortium led to the added degradation of amaranth and orange II, which neither had the ability to break down individually. The addition of dead S. coelicolor cells did not assist in the removal of the dye from the media by means of bioabsorption. The presence of the dead biomass did allow for the added degradation of biebrich scarlet, however it is unclear how this was possible  since no adherence  of the dye to the cell wall was witnessed.                           83  4.1 Concluding remarks    A broad characterization of six dye subclasses decolorized by forty-three isolates was conducted.  It was found that additional carbon supplementations  were essential for the break down of the majority of azo dyes. Furthermore, the addition of surfactants to increase enzyme production has interesting implications that should be further analyzed. A gene with a reductive mechanism of activity was linked to amido black decolorization  in  A.  orientalis.  A  basic  characterization  revealed  that  the  enzyme worked  optimally  within  a restrictive  temperature  and pH range  of 37oC  and 6.5  respectively, not a suitable candidate for the treatment of effluent which is usually an alkaline  pH.  Enzymatic  activity  of  the  dye  degrading  enzyme  tended  to  be  very specific. Moreover, this enzyme has not been linked to azo dye biodegradation prior to this. This study was expanded upon in the next chapter by also screening for the genes allowing this isolate to break down the triphenylmethane dye, crystal violet.  84  Identification and characterization of genetic elements from Amycolatopsis species contributing to triphenylmethane decolorization 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  85  	  Chapter II abstract    Focus was placed on an Amycolatopsis species isolate found to breakdown two structurally distinct classes of dye, one of which is crystal violet. This species has never  before  been  implicated  with  this  ability,  further  encouraging  focus  on  this strain. This study aimed to partially characterize the enzymes capable of dye biodegradation and identify the gene/s involved. A library was constructed in order to isolate  genetic  elements  contributing  to crystal  violet  decolorization.  Three  genes were isolated and characterized; a 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate  synthase, N5, N10- methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin  reductase and glucose/sorbosone  dehydrogenase. The synergistic  action of these genes led to crystal violet mineralization. The screening of gene expression was conducted in a closely related host species, namely S. lividans. Additionally, the activity of these genes was tested in two other strains, namely Mycobacterium spp. and Rhodococcus spp. It was found that the range of dye classes decolorized was extended in both species, showing that these genes adopted novel functional potentials in these hosts. 86  1.  Introduction    1.1 Uses of triphenylmethane dyes    Crystal violet falls in the class of triphenylmethane dyes which are commonly used in the clothing industry to dye wool, silk and cotton (Kim et al., 2005). It is well known as a biological stain, yet also possesses medicinal properties. It has been used in the treatment of pinworms and as a topical agent as well as being added to feed to prevent fungal growth (Azmi et al., 1998). In addition, it is classified as a clastogen and has been linked to tumor development in fish (Chen et al., 2007).   1. 2. Mechanism of triphenylmethane biodegradation    Bacterial triphenylmethane dye biodegradation has not generated as much interest as that of azo dyes. This is reflected strongly in the limited literature. While knowledge of the genes and enzymes involved is restricted, the mechanistic  pathway of break down is well understood. 
   Fig. 1.1: Degradative pathway of crystal violet by Nocardia corallina (Yatome et al.,  1993). 87  Yatome and colleagues (1993) were the first to elucidate the degradation of crystal violet  by Nocardia  spp.  Gas  chromatography  mass  spectrometry  allowed  them  to identify the main product as Michler’s ketone which accumulated in the media and was not able to be metabolized further.   Utilizing high performance liquid chromatography Chen and coworkers (2007) were able to elucidate the biodegradation pathway of crystal violet by Pseudomonas putida. The identification of nine degradative products allowed them to conclude that the dye is broken down by means of demethylation, yielding mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-demethylated end products. Notably, this pathway differs to that in N. corallina as illustrated in Fig. 1.2. 88  
     Fig. 1.2: Proposed crystal violet demethylation pathway in P. putida. 1 - N,N,N′,N′,N′′,N′′-hexamethyl  pararosaniline,  2  - N,N-dimethyl-N′,N′-dimethyl-N′′- methyl  pararosaniline,  3  -  N,N-dimethyl-N′-methyl-N′′-methyl  pararosaniline,  4  - N,N-dimethyl-N′N′-dimethyl  pararosanilin,  5  -  N-methyl-N′-methyl-N′′-methyl pararosaniline,  6  -  N,N-dimethyl-N′-methylpararosaniline,  7  -  N-methyl-N′- methylpararosaniline, 8 - N,N-dimethylpararosaniline,  9 - N-methylpararosaniline, 10 – pararosaniline (Chen et al., 2007) 89   In Shewanella spp. Chen and colleagues (2008) proposed a different degradative mechanism.  They  established  that  crystal  violet  was  transformed  into  Michler’s ketone and N,N-dimethylaminophenol. Unlike in the previous bacteria discussed, they identified  several  intermediates,  namely;  [N,N-dimethylaminophenyl]     [N- methylaminophenyl]   benzophenone,   N,N-dimethylaminophenol,  and  N,N- dimethylaminobenzaldehyde    [Fig.   1.3].   Again   the   main   product   formed   was Michler’s  ketone  which  through  reduction  and demethylation  split  into  derivative compounds.   Jang and colleages (2005) have discovered the only reductase definitively linked to triphenylmethane biodegradation; these researchers conducted in depth studies of the enzyme  structure.  Using   site-directed    mutagenesis  the  residues  within  the dinucleotide  binding  site  were  mutagenized,  proving  the  region  is  essential  for substrate interaction (Jang et al., 2007). They went on to predict the mechanism of action of the reductase on malachite green through crystallization experiments linked to structure-function analysis studies. These researchers were able to work out which amino acids and atoms are involved at each stage of the decolorization process [Fig. 1.4 (left)]. In an oversimplified explanation, the dye interacts with the reductase via. hydrophobic  interactions  of  leucine  and  histidine  amino  acids,  among  others.  Its docking into the ‘hydrophobic pocket’ is such that the carboxyl dye group is in close contact  with  the  carboxyl  group  of  the  NADPH  cofactor  forcing  a  break  in  the hydride bond, thus converting the dye into colorless leucomalachite  green [Fig. 1.4 (right)]. 90

Decolorization and degradation of triphenylmethane dyes by fungi    While laboratory based studies have shown that white rot fungi are capable of triphenylmethane dye degradation, their applicability in the treatment of wastewaters is limited due to their low resilience to harsh environmental conditions (Chen et al., 2008). The fungus Cyathus bulleri was capable of crystal violet decolorization; interesting  features  of  this  fungus  included  its  biodegradation  of  the  dye  in  the absence of a mediator and the lack of influence of nitrogen or pH on activity (Vasdev et al., 1995). They found the laccase was able to work in a pH range of 2-10 and unlike other fungi did not work only under nitrogen limited conditions. 91   1.4 Genes and enzymes responsible for triphenylmethane decolorization    While  a few triphenylmethane  decolorizing  bacteria  have  been isolated  very little characterization work has been conducted on the enzymes involved. In the first study attempting   to   identify   decolorizing   genes,   Kim   and   workers   (2005)   utilizing transposon  mutagenesis  isolated  twenty-six  crystal  violet  decolorizing  defective mutants of Citrobacter species. The respective genes were identified and classified as potential decolorizing genes. Five of these were putative oxidoreductases,  six were involved in the transport system and two were transcriptional regulators believed to control  the  expression  of  the  pathway.  A  further  eight  clones  were  linked  to hypothetical proteins. However, no definite gene was identified.   Jang   and   colleagues   (2005)   were   the   first   to   report   on   the   cloning   of   a triphenylmethane  reductase  gene  (TMR)  associated  with  Citrobacter  spp.  KCTC 18061P (accession no. AY756172). Unlike many azoreductases, this enzyme showed maximal activity at an alkaline pH of 9.0 and relatively high temperature of 60oC. The sequence did not show similarity to proteins of known functions. Thus, they proposed that this enzyme is a novel class of the short-chain dehydrogenase reductase family.   Similarly, only one study documenting a gene responsible for triphenylmethane  dye mineralization in a Gram positive species was recently conducted. The fbiC gene from M. smegmatis, which encodes a 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (FO) synthase involved in the biosynthesis of electron carrier coenzyme F420 was linked to this activity (Guerra-Lopez et al., 2007). 92  Table 1.1: Bacteria implicated in triphenylmethane dye decolorization    Strain Type of reductase/ oxidase O2 sensitive (S)/ O2 in-  sensitive  (I) Dye/s degraded Enzyme class- ification Reference

  3. Results    3.1 Maximum concentration of dye decolorizable by SY6    Crystal violet was added to minimal media and monitored for color removal. Strain SY6 demonstrated  an impressively  potent decolorizing  ability. Clearing of the dye was visible just five minutes after incubation. Visual observation of the decolorization over a period of time showed that the isolate struggled  to mineralize  the dye at a concentration of 30 µ g/ml [Fig. 3.1].

(In each picture the tube on the left is the dye only control and the tube on the right is inoculated with strain SY6). 10 µg/ ml crystal violet at (A) 96  20 min., (D) 40 min. and (G) 60 min. 20 µg/ ml crystal violet at (B) 20 min., (E) 40 min. and (H) 60 min. 30 µg/ ml crystal violet at (C) 20 min. (F) 40 min. and (I) 60 min.   Acclimatization  of  SY6  showed  that  the  strain  could  improve  its  decolorization capacity up to 30 µg/ml of the dye, however even prolonged incubation showed no ability to decolorize beyond this concentration.   These results were monitored on thin layer chromatography in 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min. intervals [Fig. 3.2]. At 5 min. a dramatic decrease in crystal violet intensity was already  observed;  its  monitoring  on  thin  layer  chromatography  against  untreated crystal  violet  confirmed  the  extreme  rate  of  degradation.  Four  main  bands  were observed from 5-20 min. The lowest band was no longer visible at 30 min. and both lower bands were not detected at 60 min.

The possibility of extracellular enzymatic reduction was eliminated by adding dye and cofactor  to the cell free extracellular  supernatant  and analyzing  the decolorization percentage, an insignificant decrease was indicative of cellular related mineralization.   3.2 Decolorization of crystal violet by strain SY6 in the presence of nitrogen and carbon sources   Three carbon sources, namely glucose, starch and glycerol were tested, in addition to the nitrogen sources yeast extract and peptone. Yeast extract caused a slight reduction in decolorization (~ 3 %), while the other supplements were all equally effective with efficiencies greater than 69 % [Fig. 3.3]. 98  Decolorization (%)

Non-supplemented control showed 30 % decolorization (not shown).    3.3 Combined dyes decolorized by A. orientalis SY6    It was found that the range of decolorization by strain SY6 extended to several triphenylmethane dyes other than crystal violet such as brilliant green, basic fuchsin and  malachite   green.  Since  the  isolate   was  capable   of  degrading   these  dyes individually, it was tested whether a combination of these dyes would also be easily decolorized  [Fig. 3.4]. The isolate displayed  a remarkable  ability to decolorize  the combined triphenylmethane dyes just as effectively as the decolorization of a single triphenylmethane  dye. The addition of sulfonated azo dyes, amido black and janus green did not effect decolorization. 99

The decolorized supernatant of both strains was run on TLC and the Rf values calculated for the observed bands [Fig. 3.6]. Similar banding patterns and correspondingly  Rf values were obtained for all three strains [Table 3.1].

  3.5 Detoxification of crystal violet by A. orientalis SY6    Strain SY6 decolorized the dye into a colorless derivative, however the toxicity of the by-products  generated  needed to be determined.  This was done by monitoring  the growth of an indicator strain, E. coli in the presence of the decolorized media. An inhibition  of the strain was taken  as a sign of toxicity.  The colony forming  units (CFU) per ml of the decolorized supernatant closely matched that of the media supplemented with a carbon source and was two times higher than non-supplemented media. This reflects no inhibition of the strain and thus complete detoxification.   7  6  5  4  3     2  1  0 M in. m e dia  Min. m e dia + Glucos e   M e dia  De colorize d SY6 s upe r natant    Fig. 3.7: CFU/ ml of indicator strain in minimal media, minimal media supplemented with  glucose  (0.25%)  and decolorized  crystal  violet  (10 µ g/ml)  supernatant  of  A. orientalis SY6   3.6 Creation of genomic library of strain SY6    See section 3.5 page 62 for details of library construction.    A positive selection library was created, meaning the transformable host S. lividans TK23 did not have the ability to grow on crystal violet at a low cell inoculum. Hence, any clones that were found to survive on the dye plates were screened. Following the 102

  patching of approximately  5000 clones, ten colonies displaying a resistance  to the triphenylmethane dye were isolated [Fig. 3.8].

A  slight zone of clearing can be detected around the periphery of the colonies    3.7 Screening and isolation of clones capable of crystal violet decolorization    A plasmid DNA extraction was conducted on all ten clones, of which three carried inserts.  These  clones  were  named  SlivCV2,  SlivCV4  and  SlivCV6  and  the  DNA carried  referred  to  as  pCV2,  pCV4  and  pCV6  respectively.  Restriction  analysis revealed that there was no commonality among the inserts. S. lividans clones CV2, CV4 and CV6 carried ~ 600 bp, > 2000 bp and > 2000 bp gene fragments respectively [Fig. 3.9]. 1  2  3  4   5       5000 bp   1500 bp      500  bp     Fig. 3.9: Agarose gel showing the release of inserts of pCV DNA, lanes 1: DNA  ladder, 3: pCV2 BglII, 4: pCV4 BglII and 5: pCV6 BglII 103  
  
  3.8 Characterization  of optimal pH, temperature  and carbon source utilization of clones SlivCV2, SlivCV4 and SlivCV6   3.8.1 Liquid assay determining optimal temperature of SlivCV2, SlivCV4 and SlivCV6    The  optimal  temperature  profiles  of  the  individual  clones  were  analyzed.  Clone SlivCV2  highest  decolorization  rate  was  66  %  at  20oC.  This  clone  exhibited  an atypical  contour  line,  unlike  the  bell  shaped  curve  commonly  observed.  Clones SlivCV4   and   SlivCV6   showed   optimal   activity   at   37oC   with   decolorization percentages of 67 % and 60 % respectively [Fig. 3.10].

  3.8.2 Liquid assay determining optimal pH of SlivCV2, SlivCV4 and Sliv CV6    The activity of the clones at a pH range of 6-8 was monitored [Fig. 3.11]. Clones  SlivCV2 and SlivCV4 showed optimal activity at pH 7.5 and moderate activity at pH  8.0. SlivCV4 showed highest activity at pH 7.0 which decreased rapidly with either a  0.5 increase or decrease in the pH.

The presence of fructose reduced decolorization in all cases by between 6 and 14 %. Overall,  succinate  seemed  to be the most favorable  substrate  followed  by inositol [Fig. 3.12].

Noticeably, the dye was removed from the media, however it remained attached to the cell wall of the bacteria.

  Unexpectedly, it was the combination  of all three clones that led to the mineralization of the triphenylmethane dye [Fig. 3.14].

From the results below it was evident that all three clones were required. The elimination of any of the clones resulted in partial decolorization.

  The  optimal  parameters  for  the  combined  clones  were  determined.  An  optimal temperature of 35oC and pH of 6.8 was discerned.

The resulting sequence data was compared against the NCBI PubMed database, revealing the following results:   Table 3.2: Closest protein matches to isolated sequences    Clone Description Species Maximum identity (%) E value 2 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase (DAHP synthase) Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32 95 1e-100 4 Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and N5,N10-methylene- tetrahydromethanopterin reductase-related protein Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32 85 ; 82 2e-86 ; 2e-56 6 LGFP repeat-containing protein Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32 61 7e-54 109  Insert CV2 showed high sequence identity to a DAHP synthase. Insert CV4 carried two genes namely a methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and reductase related protein. Interestingly, the reductase related protein sequence was matched to just one protein in the entire database. Five LGFP repeats in insert CV6 occured at the C terminus end of the protein, at the N-terminal end was a glucose/sorbosone  dehydrogenase and a polycystic kidney disease I (PKD) domain.   3.11 Determination of enzyme functionality    3.11.1 Tertiary structure of encoded enzymes    From the above results it was difficult to infer functions from the proposed enzymes. Thus  these enzymes  were  analyzed  on a tertiary  level.  The protein  sequence  was converted to a three dimensional structure and compared to 3D structure homologs available in the database [Table 3.3].   Table 3.3: Related tertiary structures matching identified proteins    Clone Protein Related tertiary structure and organism Related function 2 DAHP synthase DAHP synthase; Mycobacterium tuberculosis Transferase 4 Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase Methylmalonyl- CoA mutase; Propionibacterium freudenreichii Isomerase 4 N5,N10-methylene- tetrahydromethanopterin reductase-related protein 1,6 Monooxygenase; Pseudomonas putida Oxidoreductase 6 LGFP repeat-containing protein No structure available No structure available 6 Polycystic kidney disease I (PKD) domain Collagenase; Clostridium Histolyticum Hydrolase 6 Glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase Pqq-dependent sugar dehydrogenase; Pyrobaculum aerophilum Oxidoreductase 110  
  
  The only relevant matches which provided information as to possible functions were the PKD I domain, reductase related protein and dehydrogenase which were linked to a hydrolytic and oxidoreductive activities respectively.   3.11.2 Alignment of tertiary structures    A 3D alignment  of the query sequence  with the most closely related  structure  is shown below [Fig. 3.17]. In general just a moderate level of structural similarity was found.  This  was  not  unexpected  since  the  homologous  structures  available  in the database are from phylogenetically distantly related bacteria. However, it did serve to show that structurally these proteins are similar and thus can be associated with the proposed functions.

Other than crystal violet the clones were able to decolorize three sulfonated azo dyes, namely amaranth, ponceau S and biebrich scarlet [Table 3.4]. Although congo red and eriochrome T were removed from the media they remained tightly bound to the cell wall of the strains.   Table 3.4: Dyes decolorized by combined SlivCV clones    Dyes S. lividans TK23 SlivCV2  + SlivCV4  + SlivCV6 Brilliant green + + Tartrazine - - Basic fuchsin - - Crystal violet - + Amido black + + Orange II - - Janus green + + Malachite green + + Ponceau - + Biebrich scarlet - + Indigo - - Bismarck brown - - Congo red - - * Eriochrome T - - * Amaranth - + Fast green - - * - dye attached to cell wall 112  3.13 Range of dyes decolorized by combined CV DNA transformed into R. erythropolis SQ1   In the former experiment, discovery of the clones to additionally decolorize azo dyes led to the inquiry of what the result of the expression of these genes in other host species would be.  Consequently, the   pCV2,  pCV4   and   pCV6   recombinant   vectors   were   transformed   into   a Rhodococcus   spp.   host   and   referred   to  as  SQ1CV2,   SQ1CV4   and   SQ1CV6 respectively.  The  host  strain  into  which  the  DNA  was  transformed  possessed  the ability to decolorize four of the five triphenylmethane dyes, as did the clones, hence it was not possible to evaluate whether any contribution  was made by the expressed genes. Instead dyes which the original host could not decolorize were concentrated on.   Table 3.5: Dyes decolorized by combined SQ1CV clones   Dyes R. erythropolis SQ1 SQ1CV2   +   SQ1CV4   + SQ1CV6 Brilliant green + + Tartrazine - - Basic fuchsin + + Crystal violet + + Amido black - + Orange II - + Janus green + + Malachite green + + Ponceau - - Biebrich scarlet - + Indigo - - Bismarck brown - - Congo red - - * Eriochrome T - - * Amaranth - - Fast green - - Crystal violet + brilliant green +  malachite green + basic fuchsin +  orange II + biebrich scarlet - + * - dye attached to cell wall 113  
  
  The  SQ1CV  clones  decolorized  the  sulfonated  dyes  amido  black,  orange  II  and biebrich   scarlet  [Table  3.5].   Notably,  this  was  not  similar   to  the  pattern  of decolorization when in the S. lividans host.   Below  is a visual  representation  of some  of the  dyes  decolorized  by the SQ1CV combined clones. Impressively, the combination of six dyes led to complete biodegradation by the clones [Fig. 3.18].

The pCV2, pCV4 and pCV6 recombinant vectors were transformed into a Mycobacterium   spp.  host  and  referred   to  as  155CV2,   155CV4   and  155CV6 respectively. The combined 155CV clones were able to decolorize amido black, bismarck brown and janus green [Table 3.6]. Again this was slightly different to the expression of the genes in the latter and former strains.

Discussion    In the United States, three classes of dyes are classified  as harmful,  these include triphenylmethane,  azo and anthraquinone  dyes (Guerra-Lopez  et al., 2007). Having focused on the decolorization of azo dyes, focus was shifted to the triphenylmethane class of dyes.   Sixteen  Streptomycete  strains  were  screened  for  the  ability  to  biodegrade  crystal violet, however no strains capable of this were isolated. From the literature it was assumed  that since  just two Gram  positive  bacterial  species  were  linked  with the ability to degrade this dye that this was a rare trait. However, when screening known isolates from the laboratory Genetics culture collection it was surprising to find that this  ability  is  in  fact  common  among  Rhodococcus   spp.;  R.  rhodochrous,   R. erythropolis and R. opacus all displayed a potent crystal violet mineralizing capacity. Gordonia   spp.  and  Mycobacterium   spp.  were  equally  strong  triphenylmethane degraders. From the environmental isolates tested just A. orientalis SY6 displayed this activity and again was chosen for supplementary genetic screening.   Strain SY6 was capable of rapid intracellular or membrane based biodegradation of crystal violet. A reduction in the decolorization of increasing crystal violet concentrations by this isolate could be attributed to increasing toxicity of the dye or a saturation of active sites on the enzyme. It has been reported that these dyes inhibit cell  growth  by  interfering  with  nucleic  acid  synthesis  thus  decreasing  protein synthesis  (Azmi  et  al.,  1998).  Additionally,  the  presence  of  sulfonic  groups  can inhibit bacteria by acting as detergents (Chen et al., 2003).   In general, it was noticed that bacteria capable of degrading crystal violet were also able  to  mineralize  other  triphenylmethane  dyes  such  as  malachite  green,  brilliant green  and  basic  fuchsin.  Yet,  our  earlier  study  indicated  that  bacteria  able  to breakdown  an  azo  dye  from  a  particular  class  were  not  necessarily  capable  of degrading any other dyes within the same class. This allows for the speculation that either  the  enzymes  responsible  for  triphenylmethane  class  degradation  are  more lenient in their substrate interactions or the dye structural differences are minor and 116  hence easier to accommodate.  These results can be paralleled to those of the TMR (triphenylmethane  reductase)  enzyme  isolated  from  Citrobacter  species;  malachite green was found to fit most favorably into the catalytic region of TMR, however the additional dimethylamino group in crystal violet produced a less favorable interaction while the positively charged amino groups in basic fuschin were problematic (Kim et al., 2008). Additionally, research done on P. pseudomallei found that decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes was not linked to the molecular weight or permeability of the compound through the membrane (Azmi et al., 1998).   The advantage of using a consortium  for dealing with dye mixtures has been well established. Some studies have shown that bacteria which did not show an ability to breakdown certain dyes individually when combined with other strains were capable of dye decomposition (Moosvi et al., 2007; Nigam et al., 1996). These bacteria could cleave the molecule at different positions facilitating complete degradation or further catabolize the breakdown of dye products (Forgacs et al., 2004). In general microbial consortiums  have  demonstrated  an  enhanced  ability  in  anaerobic  as  opposed  to aerobic treatment systems (Nigam et al., 1996). Nevertheless, various strain combinations were tested in order to establish an ‘optimal’ aerobic consortium for a mixture of triphenylmethane  dyes. A. orientalis SY6 was combined  with either G. rubripertincta, R. erythropolis SQ1 or M. smegmatis and incubated in crystal violet media.  Overall,  all  consortium  combinations  rapidly  mineralized  the triphenylmethane dye and no strain inhibition was detected from colony counts (data not shown).   Strain SY6 was able to decolorize amido black, janus green and several triphenylmethane  dyes effectively. It was assessed whether this ability was retained when these dyes were combined. Results show that the combination of four triphenylmenthane  dyes  were  efficiently  decolorized  to colorless  derivatives.  This suggests that the same enzyme/s might be involved in the reduction of all these dyes. The addition of the azo dyes, amido black and janus green did not affect the activity of the strain. Notably, the decolorization percentages represented on the graph [Fig. 3.4] give the   false   impression   that   the   addition   of   the   azo   dyes   reduced   the   overall decolorization.  However, amido black and janus green are not reduced to colorless derivatives. Amido black is decolorized to a violet colored compound and janus green 117  is reduced to diethylsafranine which remains pink in suspension (Lazarow and Cooperstein,  1953).  Since the decolorization  percentage  corresponds  to that of the individually reduced azo dyes this shows that the multiple dyes were effectively decolorized. Similarly, Sani and Banerjee (1999) demonstrated  the potent ability of Kurthia spp. to completely decolorize five triphenylmethane  dyes (2µM) in just 30 minutes.   Nigam and coworkers (1996) reported on how the additional supplementation of yeast extract to the media in comparison to glucose led to a higher rate of decolorization, while  Chen  and fellow  researchers  (2003)  showed  that  peptone  and  yeast  extract effectively increased decolorization while glucose completely inhibited the reaction. It was also reported that the addition of starch led to 93% decolorization (Moosvi et al., 2007). Likewise, an anlaysis was conducted on the effect of additional organic nitrogen and carbon supplementations  on the reduction  of the dye by A. orientalis SY6.  Of  particular  interest  were  glucose  and  glycerol  as  these  are  low  cost supplements. With the exception of yeast extract which decreased decolorization slightly,  the  other  supplements  all proved  to increase  decolorization  equally  well, being  separated   by  less  than  1.3  %.  Although,  it  is  believed   that  the  high decolorization detected with a combination of peptone and yeast extract is due to the former compensating for the decreased activity caused by yeast extract. With fungal studies concerning dye degradation, additional nitrogen sources can either have a positive or adverse effect on decolorization. Investigators reported on the inhibition of indigo and congo red biodegradation by Aspergillus spp. at high nitrogen conditions (Khelifi et al., 2009). They proposed that nitrogen suppressed the enzymatic system and  found  that  a  nitrogen  limiting  environment  stimulates  enzyme  production. Although  its  clear  that  additional  nitrogen  reduces  decolorization,  we  found  no evidence to suggest that nitrogen limitation exerted a positive effect on activity.   The  analysis  of treated  crystal  violet  by strains  SY6,  SQ1  and 155 on thin layer chromatography showed that similar band patterns occurred. Thus, it is probable that the same degradative pathway is present in all three strains. Unfortunately, since the exact  pathway  has  not  been  uncovered  in  any  of  these  strains  it  is  difficult  to determine  what  end  products  are  being  produced.  It  was  noticed  that  following 118  prolonged  incubation,  the two upper bands remained  in the supernatant.  From the literature  we can deduce  the  possibility  of one  of these  products  being  Michler’s ketone which researchers found can remain stably in the media for 100 hours and in some instances  can not be catabolized  further (Chen et al., 2008 ; Yatome  et al., 1993). The other product is likely to be leucocrystal  violet which was reported in Citrobacter  spp. as being the first product into which the dye was rapidly reduced (Jang et al. 2005). The lower bands which are only present in the early stages are likely to be derivatives of both or one of these compounds formed through reductive splitting or demethylation; its disappearance reflecting its metabolism by the isolate (Chen et al., 2008).   The screening of the positive selection library led to the identification of three clones harboring a resistance to crystal violet. SlivCV2	  carried	  a	  DAHP synthase, SlivCV4	  a	  methylmalonyl-CoA mutase	  and N5, N10 methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin  reductase  and	  SlivCV6 a LGFP repeat containing  protein  with an associated dehydrogenase	  and	  PKDI	  domain.	  These clones were tested in order to determine their optimal pH, temperature and carbon source utilization profiles. Clone SlivCV2 had  an  unusually  low  temperature  optima  at  20oC,  while  SlivCV4  and  SlivCV6 worked best at 37oC. With regard to SlivCV2 a strong influence of temperature on decolorization was noticed; at 20oC minor amounts of dye remained attached to the cell, yet with a steady temperature increase visibly more dye adsorbed onto the cell wall.  This can be explained  by the notion  that temperature  can influence  enzyme conformations which in turn effects catalytic activity (Staub and Denes, 1969). More specifically, in many Bacillus species the feedback inhibition of this enzyme by prephenate  is  related  to  temperature  (Jenson,  1970).  I  believe  that  at  a  low temperature DAHP synthase adopts a substrate conformation allowing it to interact with the substrates and initialize the pathway, while at a higher temperature it takes on an inhibitor binding conformation, preventing its expression (Staub and Denes, 1969; Jenson, 1970). Consequently, with this particular clone an inverse correlation between temperature and decolorization percentage was demonstrated. SlivCV2 showed good activity in the neutral to alkaline pH range but activity dropped rapidly in the acidic range. Murphy and Katz (1980) mentioned that DAHP synthase activity was inhibited at a pH below 7.0. SlivCV4 carrying the reductase related protein and methylmalonyl- CoA mutase was restrictive in its range of activity, not tolerating a shift from pH 7.0. Ma et al. (1990)  reported  similar  findings  when  analyzing  the reductase  from  M. thermoautotrophicum. SlivCV6 carrying the sorbosone dehydrogenase was also restrictive, with a pH change from 119  7.5 reflecting a decrease in activity. In contrast to these  findings  the  characterization  of  this  dehydogenase  in  G.  oxydans  worked optimally  at  an  alkaline  pH  (Saito  et al.,  1997).  In  general  fructose  and  maltose supplements were linked to significant decreases in color removal. It is known that S. lividans  possesses  a  fructose  phosphotransferase  system  and  a  maltose  regulator (Kieser et al., 2000). It is probable that the strain preferentially utilizes these carbon sources impeding its utilization of the dye. Though it possesses the specialized gene glk and gyl operon which mediate glucose and glycerol catabolism respectively yet a reduction in decolorization efficacy was not noted in response to these supplements (Kieser et al., 2000). Results suggest that the mineralized triphenylmethane dye was fully detoxified  by strain  SY6.  Chen  and coauthors  (2008)  tested  the decolorized supernatant of Shewanella spp. and found that it was not completely detoxified. However,  these  researchers  used  cell  cultures  which  are  more  sensitive  than  the testing of bacterial resistance (Scribner et al., 1980).  Microbial decolorization can be attributed to either adsorption to the cell or biodegradation   (Isik   and   Sponza,   2003).   Investigation   into   the   decolorization capacities of these individual strains in liquid media was disappointing. Noticeably, the dye adsorbed onto the cell wall, indicative of incomplete biodegradation. Kalme and  coauthors   (2007)   measured   the  activities   of  several   enzymes   during   the degradation of direct blue-6 by Pseudomonas desmolyticum. They found a significant increase in the oxidative enzymes, laccase and tyrosinase till complete decolorization at 96 hours, while reductase activities were only increased later after 48 hours. This inferred the synchronized working of collective genes involved in the decolorization process. This is in contrast to many publications which have identified a single gene involved in dye breakdown. The attainment of unfavorably low decolorization rates using  individual  clones  made  us evaluate  the possibility  of several  gene  products working together to break down the dye. Correspondingly, to establish whether this might be the possibility for strain SY6, the clones were combined and the extent of decolorization monitored. With the combined strains it was noticed that the dye was completely  removed  from  the  media  and  the  cells  retained  their  original  color, indicative of mineralization.   A temperature profile of the combined strains reflected the strong influence of clone  SlivCV2  at  lower  temperatures  giving  the  graph  an  unusual  high  and  consistent 120  decolorization  from 20 – 37oC and a steady decrease  afterwards.  The pH contour reflected an overall optimal activity near neutral. The decision was made to combine the  clones  in  different  combinations  to  establish  the  minimal  number  of  clones required for mineralization. It was found that all three clones were required, however it was noticed that the contribution of each clone to the process of decolorization  was unequal.  A definite  hierarchy  was observed  with regard  to the crystal violet mineralizing  clones; the absence of SlivCV2 was the most profound, this was followed by SlivCV4 and SlivCV6.   The sequencing of the inserts from the recombinant vectors led to the identification of a DAHP synthase, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, N5, N10 methylene-tetrahydro- methanopterin  reductase  and a LGFP repeat containing  protein  with an associated dehydrogenase. Principally, all the literature thus far points towards genes with either a reductive, oxidative or oxidoreductive mechanism as being involved in dye decomposition.  The gene isolated from Citrobacter spp. was a reductase and from M. smegamatis was responsible for the synthesis of an electron carrier (Kim et al., 2008; Guerra-Lopez  et al., 2007). Hence, it was expected that these results would confer either an oxidoreductase,  reductase, oxygenase or dehydrogenase.  Correspondingly, the related reductase  and dehydrogenase  encoding  genes made sense, however  the involvement of the synthase was not immediately understandable.   With  no  immediate  relevant  functionality   observed  with  regard  to  the  DAHP synthase,  the decision  was made to shift focus to the pathway of the enzyme  and search  for  an  indirect  mechanism  of  action  resulting  from  the  by-products  or associated enzymes. DAHP synthases are divided into class Iα and Iβ, which are said to be ‘E. coli-like’ homologues. The former class requires divalent metals for activity and the latter do not require additional elements (Subramanian et al., 1998). The class II  synthases  are  described  as  higher  ‘plant-like’  homologues.  Several  plant-like DAHP synthases have been identified in actinomycetes.  These have been linked to rifamycin   production   in   A.   mediterranei,   chloramphenicol   biosynthesis   in   S. venezuelae and ansatrienin and naphthomycin generation in S. collinus (Subramanian et al., 1998). 121  The main involvement of DAHP synthase however is in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan through the shikimate pathway. This pathway is  controlled  by  several  enzymes  with  DAHP  synthase  catalyzing  the  first  step through  the  condensation  of D-erythrose  4-phosphate  and  phosphoenolpyruvate  to form DAHP. Through seven metabolic steps this is converted to chorismate which acts as the precursor for phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan as well as many other diverse  compounds,  which  include  cofactors,  coenzymes,  phenazines  and siderophores (Dosselaere and Vanderleyden, 2001). Chorismate mutase converts chorismate to prephanate which leads to the production of phenylalanine and tyrosine, shifting the pathway away from tryptophan production (Qamra et al., 2006).  Looking at the variation in substrates that arise from a single pathway has caused researchers to speculate as to the evolution of this remarkable metabolic pathway. A comparative analysis of the chorismate utilizing enzymes revealed a complicated occurrence of the divergent   evolution   of  some  enzymes   and  convergent   evolution   of  others  all progressing towards a similar function (Dosselaere and Vanderleyden, 2001).   The DAHP synthase isolated in this study was most closely related to a class II DAHP synthase  encoded  by  aroF  in  A.  mediterranei.  Hence,  we  looked  closely  at  the reactions taking place along the pathway to the production of tyrosine and identified potential  enzymes  and  biochemical   reactions  which  could  possibly  interact  or influence the dye substrate [Fig. 4.1]. Notably, the gene identified in M. smegmatis showed an indirect  link due to an oxidative  mechanism  mediated  by the synthase (Guerra-Lopez et al., 2007). DAHP synthase substrate specificity is rigid, thus it is not  likely  that  the  synthase  is  reacting  directly  with  the  dye.  The  following  are possible explanations for how these enzymes might contribute to dye decolorization. The   3-Hydroquinate   synthase   catalyzes   an   intramolecular   oxidation-reduction reaction  on DAHP  (Herrmann,  1995).  In E. coli  the  3-hydroquinate  synthase  and dehydratase are expressed constitutively (Kramer et al., 2003). Chorismate synthase is catalyzed by a reduced flavin nucleotide cofactor supplied by an associated reductase (Herrmann, 1995). Chorismate mutase possesses a prephenate dehydrogenase or dehydrolase activity (Qamra et al., 2006). Dehydrogenase  activity was identified in anaerobic bacteria and linked to the decolorization of azo dyes (Rafii and Cerniglia, 1995).  A dehydrolase  can  possess  an esterase  activity  (Akashi  et  al.,  2005).  The relevance  to this is that Bafana and Chakrabarti  (2008) by computational  methods 122  were  able  to   identify   acyl   carrier   protein   phosphodiesterases  as  potential azoreductases.  Furthermore,  the conversion of chorismate to prephenate is a highly exergonic reaction (Kast et al., 2000). We offer several possibilities of reactions in the shikimate  pathway which might contribute  to decolorization,  however cannot state with certainty whether one or a combination of these are responsible.   
    
 Fig. 4.1: The shikimate  pathway.  Enzymes  in red represent  reactions  which could potentially lead to dye decolorization (Herrmann, 1995). 123  On  an  unrelated  note,  the  shikimate  pathway  is  maintained  in  plants,  fungi  and bacteria  but  absent  in  mammals.  This  makes  the  enzymes  involved,  particularly DAHP synthase which initiates the first step of this pathway a useful antimicrobial target (Rizzi et al., 2005). An earlier study based on this concept has already shown promising  results  in  M.  tuberculosis  in  which  disruption  of  one  of  the  synthase encoded genes proved to be lethal (Rizzi et al., 2005). Another interesting feature of this pathway is that shikimate is used as a key ingredient in Tamiflu® (Kramer et al., 2003).  This  drug  of  course  received  worldwide  recognition  in  the  prevention  of possible  transmission  of the H5N1 influenza  strain. Kramer and coworkers  (2003) describe various researchers work involving metabolic engineering in E. coli strains to produce shikimate. This is in response to the shortage of this drug due to global demand.   Even though a reductase was present on the pCV4 insert, the vitamin B12  dependent methylmalonyl CoA mutase could not immediately be eliminated as a suspect in the role of dye decomposition.  Within this laboratory a potential vitamin B dependent gene was isolated from R. equi ATCC 14887  capable  of decolorizing  both amido black  and  orange  II  (Heiss  and  Dabbs,  1992).  Recently,  another  vitamin  B12 dependent  gene  isolated  from  a  Gram  negative  Duganella  spp.  was  found  to  be capable of decolorizing brilliant green (Beukes and Dabbs, 2010). With two potential vitamin  B  dependent  genes  from  unrelated  strains  displaying  decolorization  of different dyes, this was aspect into which we were obligated to look into further.   Methylmalonyl CoA mutase has been identified in many animals and bacteria such as E. coli, M. tuberculosis,  S. cinnamonensis,  C. elegans, mice and man (Gruber and Kratky, 2001). The B12- dependent methylmalonyl-CoA  mutase (mcm) catalyzes the conversion  of  succinyl-CoA  into  methylmalonyl-CoA  (Gruber  and  Kratky,  2001). This   process   is   freely   reversible,   in   favor   of   succinyl-CoA   production.   In Streptomyces cinnamonensis methylmalonyl-CoA is an essential component of polyketide antibiotics with the substrate incorporated into the polyketide backbone as a methyl branch (Birch et al, 1993). The illustration  below depicts the reaction in which  vitamin  B12  acts as a ‘radical  reservoir’  in the reaction,  which proceeds  as follows  [Fig.  4.2]:  (i)  the  homolytic  cleavage  of  the  carbon-Co  bond  of  the  5’ deoxyadenosine  cobalamin  (vitamin  B12)  cofactor,  generates  a  cob(II)alamin  and 124  deoxyadenosyl radical, (ii) the radical abstracts hydrogen from the succinyl-CoA substrate which leads to a substrate derived radical (iii) an intermolecular transfer of hydrogen is followed by an intramolecular transfer of the organic group  and, (iv) the substrate  re-extracts  hydrogen  from the deoxyadenosine,  hence  the transfer  of the radical regenerates the vitamin B12  cofactor (Banerjee and Vlasie, 2002; Dominique and Banerjee, 2006).

Once again the comprehensively studied enzyme structure and pathway were looked at to determine relevant reactions that could influence dye break down. The crystal structure of mcm revealed the presence of a TIM barrel domain, which differs from conventional  barrel  domains  that  are  hydrophobic  and  large  (Gruber  and  Kratky, 2001). The mcm barrel domain is hydrophilic and small; offering just enough space for  the  coenzyme  end  of  the  substrate  to  bind  along  the  axis.  From  this  it  was 125  conceded that the substrate specificity of mcm is rigid, therefore we propose no direct interaction of the mutase with crystal violet. Mechanistically,  this enzyme works by means  of  a  radical  mechanism  (as  described  above)  and  so  we  delved  into  the literature  to  establish  the  possibility  of  this  radical  being  ‘hijacked’  by  the  dye substrate. Studies show that the interaction between the mutase and substrate induces a conformational change causing the enzyme to surround the substrate coenzyme tail, effectively sealing it off and initiating an internal electron transfer. With this reaction taking place  within  the enzyme  cavity it is clear that radicals  are prevented  from taking part in other non-specific reactions (Gruber and Kratky, 2001). Since the gene was expressed on a high copy number vector (20-100 per cell) we looked into the probability of the mutase resulting in the generation of a low level of radicals (Hill et al., 1989). Structural experiments have shown that in the absence of the substrate, the TIM barrel domain splits apart and is essentially inactive; upon substrate instigation the barrel encloses the substrate and initiates radical exchange, making this hypothesis improbable (Gruber and Kratky, 2001). Zhang and coworkers (1999) cloned the mcm gene from the rifamycin producing strain, Amycolatopsis mediterranei and expressed it in the monensin antibiotic producing strain, Streptomyces cinnamonensis. This led to a 32 % increase in antibiotic production in the Streptomycete strain. This brings a new complicated  facet  into determining  what  could  contribute  to dye  degradation since this could mean having to take into account the extended pathway of methylmalonyl-CoA,  which  includes  its  incorporation  into  polyketide  antibiotics. Since  antibiotic  biosynthesis  is  controlled  by  multiple  enzyme  complexes  with complex interactions it would be difficult to pin point the exact reactions that could influence dye decolorization. Nonetheless, the literature surrounding this mutase only sought to establish how finely controlled and precise the mechanism of action of this enzyme is. Consequently, we were not able to show that this enzyme influences the decolorization of crystal violet and hypothesize that it is not involved in the reaction.   The N5, N10-methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin reductase (mer) was originally isolated from Methanobacterium  thermoautotrophicum  and Methanopyrus  kandleri. This gene plays a role in the pathway conversion of carbon dioxide to methane and is a  F420   dependent  reductase.  From  this  we  can  propose  that  the  mer  reductase  is probably linked to crystal violet decolorization without assistance from the methylmalonyl-CoA  mutase.  This  is  further  exemplified  by  the  fact  that  a  F420 126  dependent  enzyme  was linked  to malachite  green  mineralization  in M. smegmatis  (Guerra-Lopez et al., 2007).    LGFP repeat containing proteins contain the conserved motif, L-G-x-P-x(7)-D-G (Adindla  et al., 2004). These repeats occur in cell surface proteins and have been identified in the genomes of C. glutamicum, C. efficiens, M. tuberculosis, M.leprae, M. paratuberculosis and D. radiodurans (Adindla et al., 2004). Surface proteins can serve  numerous  functions  linked  to transportation,  cell to cell communication  and protection (Adindla et al., 2004). These repeats are not well characterized, however one study suggests that they act as ‘anchors’ which attach the protein to the cell wall (Adindla et al., 2004).   The presence of a glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase was an encouraging result since it is functionally  appropriate.  L-sorbosone  dehydrogenase  converts D-sorbital  to 2- keto-L-gulonate  which is a precursor for L-ascorbic  acid (vitamin C) (Saito et al., 1997). Conventionally, vitamin C is synthesized by means of Reichsteins method in which glucose is converted to 2-keto-L-gulonic  acid in a five step chemical process with a yield of around 50 % (Saito et al., 1997). This is a long process which results in a low yield of the precursor. Saito and coworkers (1997) introduced the sorbose and sorbosone dehydrogenase encoding genes into G. oxydans. This resulted in high level production of 2-keto-L-gulonate (130mg /ml) directly from D-sorbitol by means of oxidation [Fig. 4.3]. From this we propose that the dye is able to act as an electron acceptor during these successive oxidative reactions, facilitating its reduction. 127

The  thin lines  show  the metabolic  pathway  in G. oxydans;  the thick line shows the catalytic reaction of the membrane-bound  SNDH (shown in red), which was the target enzyme studied to improve the 2-keto-L-gulonate  production yield in G. oxydans (Shinjoh et al., 1995).   Analysis of the remaining sequence showed that a polycystic kidney disease I (PKD) domain was also present. Polycystic  kidney disease in man is characterized  by the development  of cysts on the organ leading to a progressive  loss of renal function (Bycroft et al., 1999). Mutations in the PKD1 gene (which consists of sixteen copies of the PKD domain) and pKD2 genes have been linked to this disorder. Despite the name, this domain has also been identified in bacterial genomes in association with collagenases,  chitinase and proteases.  Through a set of elegant experiments  it was 128  shown  that the PKD domain  was able  to bind collagen  and through  an unknown mechanism  caused  it to swell,  exposing  the fibers  consequently  allowing  it to be cleaved by a protease (Wang et al., 2010). Orikoshi and coauthors (2005) set out to uncover the function of the PKD domain in relation to chitin degradation. Through site  directed  mutagenesis  of  key  residues  they  were  able  to  show  that  the  PKD associated domain within the chitinase A gene directly participates in the hydrolysis of chitin. This was a key article showing that the domain plays a direct role in the biodegradation  process and does not merely act as a binding domain for substrates. Correspondingly, we propose that the LGFP region allows for attachment to the cell wall, the PKD domain which occurs on the surface, binds to the substrate and via hydrolytic   interaction   with   the   dye   is   responsible   for   partial   decolorization. Furthermore, the sorbosone dehydrogenase which can occur as a membrane bound or cytosolic protein also interacts with the dye via an oxidoreductive mechanism. While the influence of the dehydrogenase with the dye is highly probable the involvement of PKD is less so. However, this hypothesis is not completely implausible as lysozyme, which carries a hydrolytic function has been found to decolorize sulfonated azo dyes (Heiss and Dabbs, 1992). Taken altogether, these results reflect that there exists an oxidoreductive and hydrolytic mechanism of action in the presence of the combined crystal violet clones allowing for complete mineralization of the dye.   Following the realization that the combination of clones led to the decomposition of crystal violet, we decided to analyze the response of these clones in azo, sulfonated azo and other triphenylmethane  dyes. It was interesting that the expression of these genes  led  to  variable  results,  depending  on  the  host  strain  into  which  it  was introduced. I searched through the literature for homologues of the identified genes in Rhodococcus  and Mycobacterium  species in order to identify the functions  that these genes would assume in these hosts. I was unable to find any investigations into the expression of DAHP synthase in Rhodococcus species, although this has been identified  in the genomes  of this species through the genome  sequencing  projects. Chorismate mutase is expressed constitutively with minor detection of feedback inhibition in Mycobacterium spp. (Schneider et al., 2008). Since chorismate mutase posseses a dehydrogenase activity its overexpression due to the induction by DAHP synthase could influence the biodegradation of amido black, janus green and bismarck brown. A homolog of N5, N10-methylenetetra-hydromethanopterin reductase occurs 129  in M. tuberculosis, identified through the genome sequencing project, and through the KEGG pathway is hypothesized to play a role in 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4- chlorophenyl)ethane   (DDT)   degradation   and  limonene   and   pinene   degradation (Kanehisa et al., 2004).  DDT is a highly toxic pesticide which was found to adversely affect humans and wildlife leading to its subsequent ban in the 1970’s (Purnoma et al.,   2008).   The   gene   is   proposed   to   oxidize   4-chlorobenzaldehyde  to   4- chlorobenzoate,  the last step in the biodegradative  pathway (Kanehisa et al., 2004). Limonene is a hydrocarbon found in the rind of citrus fruit and pinene is present in the resin of conifers. The reductase catalyses the oxidation of myrtenal to myrtenic acid in the beginning stages of the biodegradative  pathway (Kanehisa et al., 2004). Within the abovementioned pathways oxidative reactions are the main commonality, thus it was hypothesized  that this is responsible  for the decolorization  of amido black, bismarck brown and janus green. In a Rhodococcus spp., enzymes closely related to N5, N10-methylenetetra-hydromethanopterin reductase were responsible for the biodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (commonly found in pesticides, dyes and explosives)  (Heiss  et  al.,  2002).  These  enzymes  took  on  the  role  of hydride transferases. Thus, it is possible that its function in the transferal of hydride ions allows this gene to contribute towards the decolorization of amido black, orange II and biebrich scarlet. Furthermore, within the human intestinal tract dehydrogenase activity was associated with azoreductases identified in Clostridium and Eubacterium species  (Rafii  and  Cerniglia,  1995).  This  can  be  extended  to  the  activity  of  the sorbosone  dehydrogenase.  Overall,  the difference  in metabolic  activities  and gene regulation  means  that  there  are  many  reasons  why  the  expression  of  these  genes induce different responses in different bacterial hosts.   Progressing  from  the  above  point  the  notion  of  heterologous  expression  is  an interesting one. Depending on the genes being dealt with it seems customary to screen for expression in related strains. This is a trend which is deeply ingrained in Streptomycete genetics. The model strain for Streptomyces spp. gene expression is S. lividans and S. coelicolor A3(2) (Kieser et al., 2000). Other strains such as S. griseus, S. ambofaciens and S. rimosus are also used although their use is not as wide as that of the previously mentioned strains and their derivatives. Genetic modifications made in the 1980’s improved these strains making them highly transformable and the additional development of associated vectors made them indispensable very early on. 130  Ever  since  the  isolation  of  S.  lividans  66  and  its  derivatives  as  an  effective transformation host for Streptomcyes spp., screening has been restrictively conducted in these strains. This study underscores that the expression of genes in other species can lead to a broader range of activity.  Moreover,  there is an added advantage  of expressing the genes in for instance, Rhodococcus species. These resilient strains have been implicated in the biodegradation of many pollutants such as oil and pesticides and are commonly  found in polluted  wastewaters  and toxic environments,  making them a more practical  choice for use when considering  large scale bioremediation (Aoshima et al., 2006; Shao and Behki, 1996).  4.1 Concluding remarks   Four species were identified with potent triphenylmethane degradative capacities. To our knowledge this is the first report of an Amycolatopsis  spp. being implicated in crystal violet reduction and only the second report of the characterization of triphenylmethane decolorizing genes from a Gram positive bacterium. This isolate not only  decolorized  but  detoxified  the  dye  as  well.  This  strains  ability  to  rapidly breakdown a combination of triphenylmethane dyes within a short interval makes it a suitable candidate for further bioremediation work. Furthermore, these results indicate that it would be beneficial to start a trend in which genes are not only expressed in common species which are closely related but also tested in other species.             131  5.
