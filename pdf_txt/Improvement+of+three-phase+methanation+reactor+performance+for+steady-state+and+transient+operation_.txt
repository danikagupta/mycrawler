Abstract  7 
The utilization of renewable electricity for power -to-gas (PtG) applications induces fluctuations in 8 
the H 2 availability from water electrolysis. For subsequent methanation of CO or CO 2 the 9 
unsteady -state operation of the respective reactor allows to minimize H 2 storage capacities. 10 
However, the impact of temporal fluctuations in feed gas composition on the methanation reaction 11 
and the respective transient kinetics has not yet been fully understood. We investigated the 12 
methanation of v arious CO/CO 2 (CO x) feed gas mixtures under periodically changing gas 13 
compositions with emphasis on the effect of the frequency on the reactor response. We show that 14 
the frequency response of CH 4 exhibits a characteristic hysteresis, which depends on the s witching 15 
direction between CO x-lean and CO x-rich feeds and their composition. From the shape of the 16 
hysteresis we are able to conclude on the preferred CO x species being hydrogenated to CH 4 under 17 
respective conditions, which also provides mechanistic insig hts. By applying high cycling 18  2 frequencies, the highly reactive species present under CO methanation conditions can even 1 
selectively be activated, which explains the higher reactivity compared to steady -state conditions 2 
reported, frequently.  3

1 INTRODUCTION  1 
With the Power -to-X technology the possibility arises to convert surplus fluctuating renewable 2 
electricity into chemical energy. Especially the storage of electrical energy in synthetic natural gas 3 
(SNG) via the Power -to-Gas process (PtG) is a promising o ption for temporal decoupling of energy 4 
availability and demand.1–3 Therefore,  H2 is produced from electrical energy via water electrolysis, 5 
which is subsequently used for methanation of carbon oxides available from various sources. For 6 
instance, by utilizing industrial exhaust gases as carbon sources the potential to convert highly  7 
concentrated CO 2 into CH 4 directly at the emitting spot reduces the effort for CO 2 separation prior 8 
to hydrogenation. However, these exhaust gases may also contain CO, i.e. blast furnace or 9 
converter gas in steel making.4 Both carbon oxides can be hydrogenated into CH 4 using solid 10 
catalysts (e.g. Ni/Al 2O3) via the stoichiometric reactions (1) and (2).5 11 
CO2+4H 2 ⇌CH4+2 H2O  (1) 
CO+3H2⇌CH4+H2O (2) 
From an economic viewpoint the implementation of decentralized small -scale methanation 12 
plants in proximity of carbon point sources associated with available renewable energy sources is 13 
advantageous.2 Such units, however, require minimal upstream buffer capacities to be cost - 14 
effective. This consequently leads to a propagation of fluctuations in reactant availability and 15 
comp osition into the reactor, which is the case for both H 2 and the CO/CO 2 source. Hence, the 16  4 methanation reactor needs to be operated under unsteady -state conditions for such cases with 1 
respect to fluctuations in the feed gas composition and volumetric flowra te, which induce a 2 
complex non -linear interaction of kinetic processes in the methanation reactor occurring at 3 
different length scales.1,6 Moreover, the input fluctuations can appear stochastically over a wide 4 
frequency range,1 which may result in a complex reactor behavior depending on the input 5 
frequencies.7 Dynamic changes in the inlet composition, however, may also affect the thermal 6 
behavior of the methanation reactor, since the hydrogenation of CO and CO 2 is highly exothermic. 7 
In order to avoid unstable operation regimes induced by moving hot spots8–10 or wrong way 8 
behavior,11 different temperature control strategies were developed for unsteady -state m ethanation 9 
reactors .12–16 For instance, Theurich et al . used the product recycle in a loop reactor setup as an 10 
additional control parameter , which is capable to dampen the temperature increase after step 11 
changes of the flow rate .13–15 Bremer and Sundmacher showed theoretically that by adaptive 12 
controlling the coolant temperature a CO 2 methanation reactor can be operated in an unstable 13 
operation point yielding high CO 2 conversions at moderate  catalyst temperatures.12 On the catalyst 14 
scale, the focus is on the stability of the active compound,17,18 as well as the optimal shape of the 15 
pellets to buffer fluctuations.19 16 
In order to unfold the unsteady -state reactor behavior, the evaluation of the frequency -dependent 17 
reactor response, also referred to as frequency response, is in the focus of the present contribution  18 
assuming is othermal conditions . The frequency response can, in principle, be classified based on 19 
the ratio between the cycle period duration 𝜏 and the characteristic relaxation time 𝜏C into the 20 
following three regimes:6,20,21 21 
• quasi -steady -state (qss) regime ( 𝜏≫𝜏C): The reactor response is able to reach steady -state in 22 
each half -period of the forced periodic input, since the kinetic processes are fast enough 23  5 compared to the cycle period. Thus, the amplitude of the forced input signal is not damped by 1 
the system.  2 
• relaxed steady -state (rss) regime ( 𝜏≪𝜏C): The large characterist ic time of relaxation 3 
compared to that of the forced input leads to damping and thus to an averaging of the system 4 
response over the duration of a period.  5 
• full-transient state (fts) regime ( 𝜏≅𝜏C): The transition between the qss and the rss regime is 6 
characterized by a strong sensitivity of the system response on the cycle period of the forced 7 
input signal.  8 
Based on the applied input frequency performance enhancement21–25 or even resonance effects26 9 
can occur. The nonlinear frequency response (NFR) analysis, for example, allows an a piori  10 
screening of possible rate enhancement with periodic reactor operation based on the prediction of 11 
the average composition and flow rates of the reactor o utlet stream.27,28 Therefore, a validated 12 
kinetic and reactor model applicable to dynamic operation conditions is required. The theoretica l 13 
analysis of the resulting non -linear reactor model allows to determine the possible rate 14 
enhancement depending on the applied frequency and the phase shift between two input 15 
parameters (if two parameters are modulated). However, for experimental validati on of the 16 
theoretical predictions a sophisticated experimental setup and respective procedures are required, 17 
as we pointed out, recently .6 The aforementioned NFR method was applied to the methanation 18 
reaction and predicts rate enhancement for CO and CO 2 methanation.29,30 For CO methanation 19 
various authors have confirmed experimentally that a higher CH 4 yield is possible under periodic 20 
operation compared to optimized steady -state conditions.31–33 For CO 2-methanation, in contrast, a 21 
yield enhancement was not yet confir med experimentally.34,35  22  6 In all these experimental and theoretical studies, however, the underlying phenomena 1 
responsible for the observed performance enhancement have not yet been fully understood. In 2 
particular, the effect of the forcing frequency on the kinetic processes taking place on the catalyst 3 
surface, e.g. ad -/desorption and surface reaction remains unclear. Consequently, the objective of 4 
this study is the experimental inve stigation of the frequency response of the CO/CO 2 methanation 5 
in order to correlate mechanistic effects on the catalyst surface to possible performance 6 
enhancement. Therefore, we vary the frequency of the inlet gas composition by switching between 7 
a CO x-rich and a CO x-lean feed gas and evaluate the corresponding reactor response using the 8 
Periodic Transient Kinetics (PTK) method introduced in our recent work.6 In particular, the whole 9 
range of CO/CO 2 ratios are covered experimentally in order to deduce the effect of competin g ad- 10 
/desorption and reaction steps involved in simultaneous CO/CO 2 methanation on the dynamic 11 
response. The observed effect of the forcing frequency is discussed with respect to mechanistic 12 
aspects characteristic for both CO and CO 2 hydrogenation, whose b ehavior is considered to be 13 
distinct from each other as presumed from our previous steady -state experiments5. 14 
2 MATERIAL AND  METHODS  15 
2.1. Catalyst  16 
The 5  wt-% Ni/A 2O3 catalyst is synthesized via the incipient wetness impregnation method of 17 
800 µm Al 2O3 particles (Puralox® Al 2O3-Spheres 0.8/160, Sasol Germany) by aqueous Ni(NO 3)2 18 
solution. After crushing and sieving a particle size fr action of 150 – 200 µm is selected for the 19 
experimental studies. The specific surface area of 167  m2gcat−1 and the average pore diameter of 20 
8 nm is determined by N 2 physisorption measurements (3Flex, micromeritics). Based on 21 
chemisorption measuremen ts (3Flex, micromeritics) the H 2 adsorption capacity is calculated to be 22 
48 µmol  gcat−1. Assuming dissociative H 2 adsorption as well as spherical Ni nanoparticles, a metal 23  7 surface area of 3.7  m2 gcat–1, a crystallite size of 7.5  nm and a metal d ispersion of 14.2  % is 1 
determined. Moreover, the measurements show that due to crushing the morphologic properties 2 
do not change. More information about the catalyst synthesis and characterization can be found 3 
elsewhere.5 4 
2.2. Experimental setup 5 
Since the experimental setup is described in detail previously,6 only a brief overview is given 6 
here. The experiments are conducted in a stainless -steel fi xed-bed reactor with an inner diameter 7 
of 4.5  mm and a total length of 30  cm. The catalyst sample of 50  mg is diluted with 100  mg of 8 
inert material of the same size (Al 2O3, Sasol Puralox). The resulting packed -bed (ca. 2  cm length) 9 
is placed in the center of the isothermal zone (ca. 10  cm length). For temperature measurement the 10 
reactor tube is equipped with a concentric 1/16 -inch capillary containing a moveable 11 
thermocouple. Isothermal conditions are ensured by dilution of the gas flow with He and of the 12 
active catalyst particles by inert Al 2O3. Measure ments  in the catalyst bed under reactive conditions  13 
confirm a constant temperature within a ±1.5 K range for all experiments . The catalyst packing is 14 
framed by 1.2  g glass particles (150 – 200 µm) on top (ca.  5 cm length) and 0.6  g below (ca. 2.5  cm 15 
length) to ensure homogenous flow pattern within the catalyst section. The whole packing is fixed 16 
in place by quartz wool. The gases are continuously supplied by two separate lines, which can 17 
automatically be switc hed by means of a pneumatic 4/2 way -valve (Fitok). The gases are provided 18 
from top with separate mass flow controllers (EL -FLOW Prestige, Bronkhorst) for each 19 
component and supply line. Hence, the feed gas compositions can individually be configured with 20 
H2 (5.0 purity, MTI), CO/Ar (10  vol.-% Ar 5.0  purity in CO 3.8  purity , Air Liquide), CO 2 (4.8 21 
purity, MTI), Ar (5.0  purity, MTI) and He (5.0  purity, MTI)  in all possible compositions.  22  8 Directly downflow the reactor the effluent is diluted with a mixture of H 2 (5.0, MTI) and Ne 1 
(5.0, MTI) and subsequently subjected to the analytics consisting of a gas chromatograph (GC, 2 
GC-2010, Shimadzu) and a mass spectrometer (MS, Cirrus 3 -XD, MKS). The section between 3 
reactor and analytics is kept short and is  heated  to prevent condensation of H 2O. The MS analyzes 4 
the calibrated  (regular calibration by auxiliary GC measurements)  mass -to charge ratios 2 (H 2), 15 5 
(CH 4), 18 (H 2O), 28 (CO and CO 2), 40 (Ar), and 44 (CO 2) quantitatively, while higher 6 
hydrocarbons (26: C 2H6 and C 3H8, 43: C 3H8) are monitored qualitatively, as well. The calibration 7 
for H 2O is performed in situ  under pure CO methanation conditions at 556  K and in steady -state. 8 
It is assumed that H 2O and CH 4 are produced in stoichiometric amounts, due to the absence of  the 9 
water -gas-shift reaction and a CH 4 selectivity exceeding 94  %.5,36,37 Furthermore, adsorption of 10 
H2O at the tubing walls is neglected.  11 
2.3. Experimental procedure  12 
The influence of the cycle period duration on t he methanation reaction is studied under the 13 
reaction conditions given in Table 1, where a differential reactor operation is ensured by keeping 14 
the total carbon oxide conversion below 20  %.38 The absence of intra - and inter -particle heat and 15 
mass transport limitations is confirmed applying the Mears, Anderson and Carberry criterion 16 
according to our previous study.5 Furthermore, equilibrium effects can be excluded in this 17 
temperature range,37 rendering the reaction being irreversible under the conditions studied.  18 
The forced concentration cycli ng is performed applying 50 step changes in the feed gas 19 
composition periodically by switching between the feed gas line 1 and 2 and vice versa. The half - 20 
period for each line to be contacted with the catalyst is equal, which corresponds to a cycle split 21 
𝑠=0.5 for all experiments. The experimental procedure distinguishes between experimental runs 22  9 and single experiments. Experimental runs are conducted at different temperatures and CO x ratios, 1 
each consisting of several single experiments at different cycle period durations 𝜏.  2 
The compositions used in both gas feed lines are summarized in Table 2. Note that line 1 consists 3 
of a CO x/H2 mixture, while line 2 is CO x free. The applied CO/CO 2 feed ratio is described with 4 
the parameter 𝑧, according to eq. (3) with the constant reference partial pressure of 𝑝ref=0.2 bar. 5 
The 𝑧 values of 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 are studied experimentally, since these values are characteristic 6 
for diff erent regimes of the methanation reaction kinetics as reported in our previous work.5  7

In order to ensure a comparable catalyst state, the catalyst is treated with a H 2/He flow equivalent 8 
to the composition of feed line 2 for 15  min between each single expe riment. Between the 9 
experimental runs the catalyst is regenerated for 4  h under flowing H 2 (125  mLSTP min−1), where 10 
the catalyst remained at least for 1  h at 603  K.  11

2.4. Data evaluation  2 
The data evaluation is performed as described in detail in our recent publication introducing the 3 
periodic transient kinetics method.6 In particular, the external standard Ne  is used for determining 4 
the outlet molar flow rate. Therefore, the volume variation  factor 𝛼 is calculated from the measured 5 
(𝑥Ne) and the initial ( 𝑥Ne,0) molar fraction of Ne at the reactor outlet according to eq. (4), which 6 
describes the volume variation  during  the methanation reaction. The  outlet molar flow rate of each 7 
component 𝑖 under reaction conditions, 𝑛̇𝑖,out, can now be obtained via eq. (5) based on measured 8 
outlet molar fractions 𝑥𝑖,out. 𝑅 is the universal gas constant, while 𝑝STP, 𝑇STP and 𝑉̇STP ,in are the 9 
pressure, the temperature and the inlet volumetric flow rate under standard conditions.  10

single experiment are used, in order to calculate the average outlet molar flow rate of each 2 
component 𝑛̇̅𝑖,out (𝑡) according to eq. (6). Typically, the outlet molar flow rate 𝑛̇𝑖,𝑗,out for 3 
component 𝑖 in limit cycle 𝑗 is averaged over last 25 limit cycles. The obtained result thus 4 
corresponds to the a verage limit cycle, which is subject to scientific discussion and denoted as 𝑛̇𝑖 5 
in the following for simplification . 6

Ar is used as inte rnal standard in order to measure the residence time distribution (RTD) in each 7 
individual experiment. The application of eq. (7) than allows to discriminate the effect of the RTD 8 
𝑛̇𝑖,RTD in the measured trans ient reactor response 𝑛̇𝑖 from the interaction of gaseous components 9 
with the solid surface expressed by transient molar flow rate 𝑛̇𝑖,trans. 10

𝑛̇𝑖,ss,2−𝑛̇𝑖,ss,1 (9) 
In order to determine the response for each component expe cted from RTD the step -response 11 
𝐹Ar is required, according to eq. (8). Since Ar is assumed to not interact with the solid surface, due 12 
to negligible ad -/desorption, 𝑛̇Ar,trans equals zero and hence Ar repre sents the RTD of the system. 13 
Thus eq. (9) allows to determine the step -response of the system from the measured response of 14 
the internal standard. The steady -state values for both half -periods 𝑛̇𝑖,ss,2 and 𝑛̇𝑖,ss,1 required in 15 
eqs. (8) and (9) are determined from averaging the last 10  s for each half period at a period duration 16 
of 240 s.  17  12 The rate enhancement factor 𝐸 is determined by eq. (11), which requires the average CH 4 outlet 1 
molar flow rate  (𝑛̇CH4,LC) during the average limit cycle (eq. (10)) and the steady -state value 2

for each individual component 𝑖. First, the amplitude is calculated from the outlet molar flow rates  5 
via eq. (12). The magnitude is then obtained wit h eq. (13), which relates the amplitude to that of 6

3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  8 
3.1. Effect of cycle period duration on the reactant response  9 
Figure 1 shows the individual outlet molar flow rat es of the reactants CO and CO 2, as well as 10 
those of the products CH 4 and H 2O in the limit cycle for different cycle period durations in a range 11 
between 6 and 240  s. The CO x mixture is chosen to fulfill 𝑧=0.1, since a simultaneous conversion 12 
of CO and CO 2 can be expected for that value based on steady -state experiments.5 For 𝜏=240  𝑠 13 
(blue lines) all components are reaching steady -state, which means that the system is in the qss 14 
regime concerning all components and which also provides the reference for calculating the 15 
magnitude in eq. (13). Reducing 𝜏 leads to a decreasing measured  amplitude , though the input 16 
amplitude is constant. Furthermore, this affect is differently pronounced for the components 17  13 studied. For instance, the amplitude of CO and CO 2 shrinks only slightly upon reducing  the cycle 1 
period duration to 30  s indicating that both components remain in the qss regime. In contrast, the 2 
amplitudes of H 2O and CH 4 are clearly damped for 𝜏=30 s, already. Further reduction of the 3 
cycle period durations leads to a shift for CO and CO 2 into the fts regime, while H2O appears to 4 
even reach the rss regime for 𝜏=6 s indicated by the almost constant signal during the whole limit 5 
cycle.  6

of the normalized time within the limit cycle 𝜃=𝑡/𝜏 (reaction conditions: z  = 0.1, 556  K, 2 bar).  9 
The effect of the cycle period duration on the reactant response is depicted in Figure 2 by plotting 10 
the magnitude 𝑀𝑖 for each component. The response for the internal standard Ar represents the 11 
real RTD including the dynamic transport processes at the macro and meso scale.6 It can be 12 
observed that the magnitude is constant for cycle period durati ons above 30  s and decreases with 13 
a constant slope of 6  dB/decade below durations of 30  s. This clearly indicates that the Ar response 14 
is in the qss regime for long cycle periods and shifts into the fts regime below 30  s. The observed 15 
 14 trends for CO and CO 2 are rather similar Ar, particularly regarding the slope of ca. 6  dB/decade 1 
for cycle period durations below 30  s. The similar slope in magnitude for CO, CO 2 and Ar suggests 2 
that the respective response is governed by the systems RTD, which is expected for  reactants as 3 
predicted by Meyer et al. for simplified cases.7 4 
 5 
Figure 2: Magnitude 𝑀𝑖 of the outlet molar flow rate for each component as function of the cycle 6 
period duration 𝜏 (reaction conditions: z  = 0.1, 2  bar, 556  K). 7 
In contrast, the trends for CH 4 and H 2O differ si gnificantly. The H 2O magnitude decreases by 8 
11 dB/decade over the whole range of cycle period durations, while the CH 4 magnitude seems to 9 
exhibit different slopes, the average of 7  dB/decade being between those of H 2O and Ar. The 10 
decreasing slopes for CH 4 and H 2O compared to Ar are expected from our theoretical 11 
considerations,7 since both components are formed by reaction. Interestingly, the slopes of CH 4 12 
and H 2O differ from each other, though both are formed simultaneously. This contradiction can be 13 
explained by an instantaneous desorption of CH 4 from the  solid surface upon formation, while 14 
H2O remains adsorbed for a certain time. In principle, this consideration agrees with our 15 
 15 experimental results obtained for a fixed cycle period duration of 240  s, where a delay of the H 2O 1 
response is reported compared to CH 4.39 Furthermore, a high sorption capacity of the active and 2 
support material is known for H 2O40, which is responsible for the delayed desorption.   3 
From the effect of the cycle period duration on the magnitude of all components considered here 4 
it can be concluded tha t the reactor system is capable for damping of the inlet fluctuations, in 5 
particular for fast changes. The reactor volume, characterized by its RTD, acts as respective buffer 6 
for that purpose. For the products, the solid surface provides additional buffer storage leading to 7 
even more pronounced damping of the inlet fluctuations. An additional damping effect of the solid 8 
surface for CO x species, however, was not observed in the present work. Therefore, an individual 9 
characteristic time 𝜏𝑖,C obviously exists for each component.  10 
3.2. Frequency response of CH 4 11 
The impact of the cycle period duration on the CH 4 response in the limit cycle is depicted in 12 
Figure 3. The steady -state values for each experimental run are determ ined from the experiments 13 
with a cycle period duration of 240  s (see reference case for eq. (13)) and are displayed as black 14 
and grey diamonds. The course of the CH 4 response within a limit cycle for each specific v alue for 15 
𝜏 is characterized by a hysteresis between the CO x-lean (solid lines) and the CO x-rich phase 16 
(dashed lines). Since the CH 4 response increases after switching to the CO x-rich phase and exhibits 17 
a delay of the measured compared to the expected valu es, the trajectory in the state space plot 18 
(Figure 3b)) develops in counter -clockwise direction as indicated by the black arrows. In order to 19 
support the following discussion region of interests in the graphs are in dicated with red and orange 20 
diamonds.  21  16   
Figure 3: CH 4 outlet molar flow rate for different cycle period durations 𝜏 as function of the 1 
normalized time within the limit cycle (a) and depicted in the corresponding state space plot (b) 2 
(reaction conditions: z  = 0.5, 556  K, 2 bar). 3 
It can be seen that the hysteresis is most pronounced for a cycle period duration of 240  s, since 4 
the steady -state values are reached for both the CO x-lean and CO x-rich phase. This means that no 5 
CH 4 is produced during the CO x-lean phase for over 50  s. For shorter cycle period durations the 6 
steady -states are not reached, neither for the measured n or for the expected response, and thus the 7 
hysteresis is compressed. As discussed above already, the magnitude decreases for all components 8 
with shorter cycle periods, which directly relates to narrowing of the hysteresis. The comparison 9 
of the 240 with th e 6 s cycle period reveals that the hysteresis is absent for low 𝑛̇CH4,RTD (grey 10 
arrow) at short cycle periods, since CH 4 is also formed in the CO x-lean phase.  11 
From Figure 3b it is apparent that the hystere sis branch  in the CO x-rich half -period exhibits only 12 
a local maximum (red diamond) for a cycle period duration of 240  s. This maximum corresponds 13 
to an overshoot in CH 4 formation rate, which is most likely caused by high H 2 coverage prior 14 
 17 switching to the CO x-rich phase as reported previously.39 Reduction of the cycle period duration 1 
leads to shorter CO x-lean phases and therefore only partial conversion and subsequent desorption 2 
of the reaction intermediates adsorbed at the catalyst surface. Consequently, a c ertain amount of 3 
those intermediates is still adsorbed after switching to the CO x-rich phase occupying sorption sites 4 
and thereby reducing the number of active sites available for H 2 to adsorb. Additionally, CO can 5 
only desorb partially from the surface du ring shorter cycle periods, due to kinetic limitations of 6 
the desorption. These effects lower the initial H 2 coverage prior to the CO x-rich phase and hence, 7 
the CH 4 formation rate is reduced leading to a diminishing overshoot in that half -period. At the 8 
same time the upper branch, corresponding to the CO x-lean half -period, remains rather unaffected 9 
(orange diamond). Therefore, the CH 4 methanation rate exceeds the value of the steady -state 10 
almost during the whole CO x-lean half -period  for short durations, whi le it approaches zero for long 11 
durations. This means that CH 4 formation is favored during the CO x-lean phase.  12 
This behavior can be explained by formation of two carbon containing intermediates on the 13 
catalyst surface, which differ in their reactivity. In particular, upon switching to CO x-free mixtures 14 
a highly reactive species is completely converted with a certain rate independent on the cycle 15 
period duration, as indicated by the rather unaffected upper branch and the global maximum of the 16 
hysteresis. Consequently, the generation and conversion of the highly reactive species has to be 17 
faster than the shortest cycle periods, as enough CH 4 is provided to maintain the global maximum 18 
in the response. The existence of a highly reactive species is supported by t he observations of 19 
different authors.41–43 Fujita et al.41 investigated the tran sient CH 4 response by DRIFTS 20 
measurements for CO and CO 2 hydrogenation. They conclude that  the maximum resp. overshoot 21 
is caused by the hydrogenation of a  highly reactive, carbonaceous species adsorbed at the solid 22 
surface, which is suggested to contain on ly carbon (C α). As the CO containing feed is switched 23  18 off, the linearly adsorbed CO molecules desorb releasing sites available for H 2 adsorption during 1 
the CO x-lean half period. This causes a rapid hydrogenation of C α into CH 4 and therefore the 2 
observed ov ershoot.  3 
The hydrogenation of the less reactive species, in contrast, is strongly affected by the cycle 4 
period duration. For 𝜏=240 s this species can be completely converted to CH 4 and, hence, the 5 
respective outlet molar flow rate approaches zero at the e nd of each half -period. For shorter cycle 6 
periods , however, the CO x-rich phase starts accompanied by adsorption of CO before full 7 
conversion of the less reactive surface species into is CH 4 reached. Thus, CH 4 is detected in the 8 
outlet stream during the who le limit cycle. The existence of such species is in accordance with the 9 
observations of d ifferent authors.41–43 10 
3.3. Effect of temperature and CO/CO 2 ratio 11 
The response of CH 4 is depicted in Figure 4 for different cycle period durations, temperatures 12 
and CO x feed compositions. Note, that the data of subfigures f and g correspond to those of Figure 13 
1 and Figure 3, respectively.  14 
From Figure 4 it is apparent that the hysteresis branch during CO x-rich feed composition (lower 15 
branch) exhibits a local maximum only for 𝑧=1 and 0.5 and a cycle period duration of 240  s 16 
(first two columns in Figure 4) before approaching the steady -state. The maximum diminishes for 17 
shorter cycle periods and lower 𝑧 values. Furthermore, a global maximum in C H4 formation rate 18 
occurs under CO x-lean feed gas composition. For decreasing 𝑧 values the maximum value 19 
decreases, as well, and diminishes completely for small 𝑧=0 (pure CO 2 methanation) . Therefore, 20 
the observed hysteresis for methanation of pure CO ( 𝑧=1) and CO 2 (𝑧=0) deviate significantly 21 
with respect to the occurring maximum and two different reaction mechanisms are likely to occur 22 
depending on the CO/CO 2 ratio. For CO methanation we have shown recently  that the dynamic 23  19 CH 4 response is governed by th e presence of a highly reactive carbide species (C α) assuming  the 1 
carbide pathway mechanism .44 In particular, t he C α species are formed at the active surface during 2 
the build -up phase under CO methanation conditions (high 𝑧 values) . After switching to the back - 3 
transient phase, the C α compounds are hydrogenated very fast to CH 4, which causes the oversho ot 4 
in the CH 4 response due to the surplus availability of H 2. Since, C α species are only formed under 5 
CO methanation conditions (high 𝑧 values) , but not significantly for small 𝑧 values,41,43 the 6 
overshoot is not observed under CO 2 methanation conditions . Specificall y, in case of CO 2 7 
methanation Fujita et al.41 report hydrogenation of less reactive species after switching to pure H 2, 8 
which is not accelerated sufficiently to c ause an overshoot. Therefore, the CH 4 formation rate 9 
decreases monotonously with the CO 2 fraction in the gas phase. For 0<𝑧<1 the amount of C α 10 
scales with 𝑧, which affects the extent of the observed overshoot.39 Consequently, based on the 11 
form of the hyste resis the participation of CO and CO 2 during CO x methanation can be 12 
differentiated.   13 
This hypothesis is supported by the observed temperature dependency and the expected impact 14 
of temperature on the sorption equilibrium and the surface reaction rates. At h igher temperatures 15 
the amount of adsorbed carbonaceous species is reduced and, thus, more active sites are available 16 
for H 2.43,45 Since the reaction r ate increases as well, as becomes apparent from the scale of the 17 
ordinate axis, both factors lead to an enhanced hydrogenation rate of adsorbed carbonaceous 18 
species  at the catalyst surface during the CO x-lean phase. Therefore, smaller coverage degrees 19 
regarding those species remain at the end of the CO x-lean half -period, which correspond to lower 20 
CH 4 formation rates. Hence, the hysteresis expands with increasing temperatures towards smaller 21 
CH 4 outlet molar flow rates.  22  20  1 
Figure 4: CH 4 outlet molar flow rates for different cycle period durations 𝜏, temperatures 𝑇 and 2 
CO x feed compositions 𝑧 (reaction pressure: 2  bar). 3 
In conclusion, the carbide pathway mechanism is evident due to the presence of C α species for 4 
CO methanation, while the H 2 assisted pathway mechanism  is likely for CO 2 methanation , since 5 
 21 Cα species are not observed. These mechanistic findings are in agreement with literature on 1 
CO/CO 2 hydrogenation on Ni catalyst.2,46,47 2 
3.4. Performance enhancement  3 
From the frequency response results one may hypothesize that it is possible to increase th e 4 
average CH 4 formation rate by decreasing the cycle period duration, especially at low temperatures 5 
and CO containing feed gas mixtures. Therefore, Figure 5 displays the reactor performance in 6 
terms of the rate enh ancement factor 𝐸. Obviously, for 𝜏=240  s the lowest reactor performance 7 
is achieved, while it increases for shorter durations. The extent of improvement, though, depends 8 
on the CO/CO 2 ratio fed, increasing from pure CO 2 to pure CO methanation.  9 
 10 
Figure 5: Rate enhancement factor  𝐸 as function of the cycle period duration 𝜏 and CO/CO 2 feed 11 
gas ratio 𝑧 at a temperature of 556  K. 12 
In comparison, Table 3 summarizes the rate enhancement factor 𝐸 for the hyd rogenation of CO 13 
or CO 2 from various literature reports. For the CO methanation the CH 4 yield is reported to 14 
 22 increase by reducing the cycle period duration, regardless of the catalytic system.31–33 Hence, it is 1 
likely that the observed rate enhancement is caused by the selective activation of the highly 2 
reactive Cα intermediate species during the CO x lean phase . For example, Yadav and Ri nker31 3 
observed a rate enhancement only for cycle periods shorter than 16  s with a comparable catalyst, 4 
which suggests that they also primarily activate the highly reactive Cα species, while the less 5 
reactive speci es remain in a dynamic equilibrium on the catalyst surface. For CO 2 methanation, in 6 
contrast, the reaction rate can also be increased by shorter cycle periods, but hardly exceeds the 7 
corresponding steady -state values,34,35 what we observe as well ( Figure 5).  8

The rate enhancement  potential is discussed for peri odic changes in the inlet gas composition, 11 
which is most studied in literature  (see Table 3), as well. However, f rom the results reported in 12  23 Figure 4 a strong impact of tempe rature on the periodic response becomes evident. Hence, periodic 1 
changes in temperature most probably  allow further enhancement in performance.  2 
4 CONCLUSION  3 
The influence of the cycle period duration of the inlet gas composition on the unsteady -state 4 
CO x methanation reaction was investigated under realistic conditions. The dynamic experiments 5 
were conducted by periodically exchanging a gas mixture containing H 2 and a certain CO/CO 2 6 
ratio with a CO x-free gas feed keeping the H 2 concentration constant. Differen t CO/CO 2 ratios  7 
were studied between pure CO and pure CO 2 in order to investigate the competing effects of both 8 
carbon oxides and deduce experimental insights for flexible operation. The frequency response of 9 
the components was evaluated  in the quasi -stead y-state (qss), full -transient state (fts) and relaxed 10 
steady -state (rss) regime , putting emphasis on CH 4. The following conclusions can be deduced 11 
from the obtained results:  12 
• Based on the applied cycle period durations each component exhibits a characterist ic 13 
dynamic behavior. For longer cycle periods the components remain in the  qss regime 14 
approaching the respective steady -state values in each half -period. Reducing the cycle 15 
period duration leads to a shift towards the fts are even the rss regime, which bec omes 16 
most pronounced for H 2O and the shortest investigated cycle period.  17 
• An analysis of the magnitude reveals that the frequency response of the reactants differ 18 
from that of the products. While the reactants follow the internal standard and thus the 19 
RTD, the products exhibit a decline of the magnitude with decreasing cycle period 20 
durations with a larger slope. This low -pass behavior agrees with predictions for more 21 
simple cases. Furthermore, storage of the formed products in the system by adsorption 22 
at the  catalyst surface is also observed in the frequency response by an even more 23  24 pronounced damping of the input fluctuations, expressed by a steeper drop of the 1 
magnitude.  2 
• The form of the hysteresis in the state -space plot is significantly correlated with th e 3 
presence of CO, the temperature and the cycle period duration. The interpretation of the 4 
state space plots supports the presence of reactive Cα species at the catalyst surface. These 5 
species cause CH 4 formation rates exceeding values expected from steady -state 6 
experiments and appear to require CO in the gas phase.  7 
• The highly reactive Cα species can selectively be hydrogenated into CH 4 by a redu ction 8 
of the cycle period duration, since the less reactive surface species become rather inert. 9 
This is likely to be the reason for the enhancement of the average CH 4 formation rate 10 
under concentration forcing conditions with respect to the steady -state, which is reported 11 
for methanation of CO, but not for CO 2.31,32 The results  obtained in this work for 12 
simultaneous methanation of CO and CO 2 underline the importance of CO for the 13 
enhancement in average methanation rate and therefore the hypothesis of reactive Cα 14 
species, as well.  15 
Our results are based on measuring the transient reactor response in form of the outlet gas 16 
composition. The application of evaluation procedures based on material balances allows us to 17 
deduce molar flow rates for the relevant component s present in the gas phase. Therefore, the 18 
conclusions drawn regarding kinetic processes taking place or species present at the surface are 19 
not directly verified by measurements. For this purpose,  complementary  in situ  and operando  20 
experiments are required  for the unsteady -state CO x methanation, in order to verify the discussed 21 
hypotheses  in future work . In particular, X -ray absorption spectroscopy combined with modulation 22 
excitation spectroscopy (XAS -MES), recently reported by Serrer et al. ,48 appears to be promising 23  25 to link the periodic response of the gas phase measured via the periodic transient kinetics ( PTK ) 1 
method with the dynamics of kinetic processes at the solid surfaces . Those combined experiments 2 
provide the basis for the ful l kinetic understanding of the dynamic catalyst behavior including the 3 
storage capacity of the reactants at the active and support material and, hence, for development 4 
and validation of a micro kinetic model applicable to the unsteady -state methanation rea ction.  5
