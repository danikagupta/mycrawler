 Abstract:  30 
 The present study focuses on the process  devel opment for degradation of reactive azo dyes 31 
(Reactive Orange 16, Reactive Red 120 and Direct Red 80 ) by Ozonolysis . The process was 32 
optimised  using One Variable At a Time  (OVAT ) approach followed by Response  Surface 33 
Methodology (RSM).  The operational param eters influencing the process of degradation, i.e. 34 
initial dye concentration (mg/L), pH and ozone exposure time were modelled using  Central 35 
Composite Design (CCD) . Under the optimal condition (Initial dye concentration = 2000 mg/L, 36 
pH = 11 .0, Ozone exposure time = 10 mins), the highest desirable response (i.e. Concentration of 37 
the degraded dye ) for the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 are 1289.35  mg/L, 1224.98  38 
mg/L and 1039.87  mg/L , respectively.  The high correlation coefficient s, 0.9814 (RO 16), 0.9 815 39 
(RR 120) and 0.9 685 (DR 80) indicates the closeness of the results predicted  by RSM with the 40 
experimental results. The rate of degradation for all the three dyes at the optimal condition 41 
followed pseud o-first order kinetics . The predicted model was also evaluated by partial derivative - 42 
based equation modelling and experimental approach. The reliability and applicability of the 43 
developed process were  confirmed by degrading the synthetic mixed dye effluent.   44

 1. Introduction  53 
Industries play a major role in gearing up the economy of a nation and hence they are 54 
recognized as the “ engine of economic growth ”. Textile industries belong to the subsector of the 55 
manufacturing industry that has a major contribut ion to the economy of many countries such as 56 
China, Ban gladesh, India, Vietnam, Turkey  and Nigeria  [1]. India accounts 63 % of the market 57 
share of textiles and garments. The Textile and Apparel (TA) industry in India, contributes to 14% 58 
of total industrial production, 4% of gross domestic product and 15% of total export earnings 59 
(2016 -17) (Textile Ministry, Make in India, TechSci Research) . Despite being the major 60 
contributor to the global economy, textile industries im pose a strong negative environmental 61 
impact associated with water pollution  [2]. The textile  processing  units consume  large quantity of 62 
water for various operations such as washing, dyeing, rinsing  and finish ing [3]. Everyday around 63 
3.7 million litres of wastewater  is produced worldwide by the textile industries [4]. An estimation 64 
shows that 7 × 105 metric tonnes of synthetic dyes are produced annually , in which the global 65 
consumption by the textile industrial sector is m ore than 10,000 tonnes/year  [5]. Azo dyes 66 
represent 60% of the commercially available synthetic dyes and they are extensively used in the 67 
textile industries [6]. Azo dyes are of different classes, based on their charge, they are classified 68 
as cationic (all basic dyes), anionic (direct, acid, and reactive dyes), and non -ionic (disp ersed dyes) 69 
[5]. Owing to the d emand for fabric with bright colours , usage of reactive dyes containing azo 70 
based chromophores with reactive groups such as chlorotriazine, vinyl sulfo ne, 71 
trichloropyrimidine, and dichlorofluoropyrimidine  has increased [7, 8]. The fixation rate of these 72 
reactive dyes  to the cotton fabric  is about 60-90%; the unfixed residual dye s along with large 73 
amount of water used in the dyeing process are disposed as textile effluents [9]. The untreated or 74 
partially treated textile effluent  released into the environment and natural water bodies  is of great 75 
concern, since it affect s the photosynthetic activity of the aquatic biota and also  result s in a bio- 76 
magnification . In addition, these dyes with bright colour, complex chemical structure  and 77 4 
 recalcitrant property  may induce carcinogeni c, mutagenic or teratogenic effects in the liv ing 78 
system  [10-12]. The conventional treatment methodologies such as adsorpt ion on activated carbon, 79 
flocculation, coagulation,  ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis are inappropriate for the industrial 80 
application , since they generate large quantity of sludge  ,which requires post-treatment  and makes 81 
the process expensive [13, 14]. In the recent years, Advanced Oxidat ion P rocess , which employs 82 
hydroxyl radicals for the oxidation of a wide range of recalcitrant pollutants , has attracted the 83 
attention of environmental engineers for development of a zero discharge technology  [15]. AOPs 84 
based on the ozonation  method  has been reported as a promisi ng remediation technology for the 85 
removal of dyes, which involves oxidative cleavage of the organic dye molecule by direct and 86 
radical oxidation pathway  [16]. For direct oxidation [17]: 87 
O3+dye →dye oxid(oxidation  product  of dye)      (1) 88 
For i ndirect /radical oxidation [17]: 89 
O3+H2O→HO°+ O2         (2) 90 
HO°+dye →dye oxid          (3) 91 
The advantages  of ozonation are decomposition of residual ozone to oxygen  [18, 19], no 92 
sludge generation , color and organic reduction in a single step, requirement of less space and on - 93 
site installation [4, 20]. Moreover, the main source of ozonation is air , which is ubiquitous  hence 94 
development of such a process for a real-time application in textile effluent treatment is of great 95 
significanc e. Large -scale implication of  the potent oxidative technology such as ozonation remains 96 
an issue due to the lack of control in the complex multivariate operating system , which encompass 97 
the following factors: ozone mass transfer ratio, mechanism of reaction and ratio of hydroxyl 98 
radical produced  [21]. To address the problem, there is a need to adopt an efficient and systematic 99 
approach in the process control and development.  Conventional or statistical methods can be 100 
employed for process optimization. OVA T (One Variable A t a Time)  approach is a conventional 101 5 
 method of process optimizati on, in which the influence  of the individual variable on the  process is 102 
examined by variation of one parameter, while the others are maintained constant.  The 103 
conventional methods are time consuming and do  not provide a dequate information for effective 104 
optimization  of the process. Response Surface Methodology (RSM), a powerful statistical 105 
experimental design tool , overcomes the limitations of the conventional methods and considers the 106 
interactive effect between the variables. RSM involves optimization of  a complex , unknown noisy 107 
function into a simple function, for a small region under designed experimental conditions [7, 22, 108 
23].  109 
The prese nt work aims to develop an Ozonolytic process for the degradation of industrially 110 
used textile dyes  namely  Reactive Orange 16  (RO 16  - Mono azo), Reactive Red 120 ( RR 120 Di- 111 
azo) and Direct Red 80 ( DR 80  - Poly azo) . The dyes were selected based on the industrial usage 112 
of reactive and direct azo dyes [8]. The linear effect of the process parameters like pH, initial dye 113 
concentration (mg/L) and ozone exposure time on the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 114 
were studied by OVAT (O ne V ariable At a Time) approach. Three Factor level Box -Wilson face 115 
centered  Central Composite Design (CCF) based Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used 116 
to study the interactive effect between the process  parameters on the response (concentration of 117 
dye degraded -mg/L) and  the process was statistically optimized . The r eaction kinetics for the 118 
degradation of all the three dyes w as established. The effectiveness  of the developed process was 119 
also evaluated for the simulated synthetic mixed dye effluent containing RO 16, RR 120 and DR 120 
80 dyes. The process was mathematically modeled using p artial derivative equation and was 121 
experimentally compared and verified with the CCD experiments . 122

2.1. Materials  Used:  126 6 
 Reactive Orange 16 ( RO-16), Reactive Red 120 ( RR-120) and Direct Red 80 ( DR-80) were 127 
used as the model dyes in this  study. The se dyes were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich, India. The 128 
physicochemical properties of these dyes are available  in Table 1. The dye solutions of different 129 
concentrations (100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 mg/L) were prepared using deionized water. Ozone 130 
(500mg/h) was generated  using an ozone generator (principle of corona discharge) purchased from 131 
Ozone Engineers Pvt.L td., India. The pH of the ozonised and non –ozonised samples were 132 
measured by pH meter (Elico, LI 617). Other chemicals such as s odium hydroxide and sulphuric 133 
acid were obtained from Spectrum reagents and chemicals Pvt. Ltd, India .  134

2.2. Ozonolysis of aqueous dye solution:  136 
Ozonolysis of aqueous dye solutions (RO -16, RR -120 and DR -80), concentration 137 
500mg/L , were  carried out at pH 11.0 by purging  ozone into a closed container  of 11.3 cm height 138 
and 2.8 cm diameter. The absorption spectra were monitored using UV -Visible Spectro meter 139 
(Eppendorf  - Kinetic, Germany) for the ozonised and non –ozonised samples. The percentage of 140 
degradation and changes in the concentration of dye during Ozonolysis was calculated using t he 141 
equation 4, 142 
% of dye degradation =(Cb−𝐶𝑓
𝐶𝑏) × 100        (4) 143 7 
 where Cb and Cf  are the maximum absorbance of the dye solution before and after 144 
irradiation respectively.        145 
 146 
2.2.2. Influence of process parameters on the degradation of azo dyes – OVAT:  147 
The linear effect s of the process variables ( Initial dye concentration, pH and ozone 148 
exposure time ) on the response (concentration of dye degraded) by Ozonolysis  was studied through  149 
One Variable at a Time Approach  (OVAT) . The effect of ozone exposure time (10 to 30 mins) on 150 
the degradation of the ( RO-16, RR -120 and DR -80) azo dyes was studied b y treating aqueous dye 151 
solution  of concentration 500 mg/L prepared at pH 11.0. The influence of pH on the degradation  152 
was studied in  the dye solution s of various pH ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 of 500 mg/L initial dye  153 
concentr ation were exposed to ozone for 2 0 mins. The effect of initial dye concentration on the 154 
degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 azo dyes was studied by exposing dye solutions of 155 
varying concentration (200 -1000 mg/L) to 500 mg/h ozone for a constant time period of 20 mins , 156 
at a pH11.0.  157 
 158 
2.2.3. Process optimization by RSM  159 
          Conventional optimization me thod such as One Variable A t a Time Approach provides 160 
information only about the linear effect of the operational parameters and hence Response Surface 161 
Methodology, has been adopted to study  the linear, interactive and quadratic influence of the 162 
process parameters on the response  [7, 24]. Box -Wilson Central Composite Design (CCD) method 163 
is extensively used in process optimization since it helps in acquiring sufficient information to test 164 
lack of fit with minimal design points [9]. In the present study, three factor -five level Box -Wilson 165 
Face Centred Central Composite Design (CCF) algorithm was used in  Design -Expert 7.0.0., Stat - 166 
Ease, USA. The entire experimental design with 20 runs is divided into three components such as 167 
factorial points, axial points and centre points.  168 8 
 [(𝐍=20)=𝟐𝐤=𝟑 (8 factorial  points )+𝟐𝐤 (6 axial  points )+𝐱𝟎 (6 Centre  points )]       (5) 169 
where , N, k and x 0 are the number of required experiments, the number of parameters and the 170 
number of central points respectively [25]. The factorial points represent  the design points coded 171 
at low and high levels of each factor. The star or axial points located at the centre of each face of 172 
the factorial space allows estimation of the cu rvature of the model. These points are dispensed in 173 
such a way that the standard error of the response variable remains the same at any point of the 174 
response surface. The centre points in the design space provides degrees of freedom for estimating 175 
experime ntal error and also helps in the determination of precision of the response variable near 176 
the centre [7]. The dependent and independent vari ables in the current study are pH, initial dye 177 
concentration (mg/L), ozone exposure time (mins) and concentration of dye degraded (mg/L) , 178 
respectively. The levels of the independent variables (Table 2) were determined by the screening 179 
experiments (OVAT) at  37°C. The relation between the response variable and the independent 180 
variables was established by the quadratic or linear model. An empirical equation depicting the 181 
quadratic model along with the linear model is as follows:  182 
𝒀= 𝜷𝟎+ ∑ 𝜷𝒋𝒙𝒋  + ∑ 𝜷𝒋𝒋𝒙𝒋𝟐+ ∑∑ 𝜷𝒊𝒋𝒌
<𝒋=𝟐 𝒊  𝒙𝒊𝒙𝒋𝒌
𝒋=𝟏  𝒌
𝒋=𝟏                  (6) 183 
where, Y is the predicted response, xi and xj are variables, β 0 is constant coefficient, β j, βjj 184 
and β ij are interaction coefficients of linear, quadratic and the second -order terms, respe ctively.  185 
The significance of the model was determined by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Quality of the 186 
model and statistical significance of the model terms were evaluated using Fischer’s  or F-Test and 187 
correlation coefficient R2  [26]. 188

2.2.4 Partial differential derivative based model : 190 
 The degradation of azo dyes (mono -, di-, poly -) by ozonation is represented in 191 
mathematical expr essions shown in  the equations 9 , 10, 11. The partial differential expression with 192 
respect to A, B & C was derived and the response was calculated by solving those equations at 193 
specific constraints. The experimental response , i.e. concentration of dye degraded (mg/L) , is 194 
compared with model predicted response and equation based response.  195 
2.2.5. Kinetics of ozonolytic degradation  196 
The r eaction kinetics was determined for the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 at the 197 
optimal condition from the CCD  method (initial dye concentration= 2000 mg/L, pH= 11 and 198 
Ozone exposure time = 10 mins). The rate of degradation was calculated b y fitting the 199 
experimental data approximated to pseudo -first order rate equation (with re spect to dye) in 200 
equation ( 7 & 8). 201

where  kd′=k[O3] represents pseudo -first order rate constant [27, 28]. The rate of 204 
degradation thus obtained at the optimal condition of RSM was  critically analysed.  205 
2.2.6.  Degradation of simulated  industrial  dye effluent  206 
 A mixture of synthetic dye effluent (RO 16 (666.3 mg/L) + DR 80 (666.3 mg/L) + DR 80 207 
(666.3 mg/L)) was pre pared and ozonated at the optimal condition obtained from CCD  of RO 16, 208 
RR 120 and DR 80 ( initial dye concentration = 2000 mg/L, pH = 11 and ozone  exposure time = 209 
10 mins) . The process of degradation was monitored within the time interval by measuring the 210 
absorbance of the synthetic mixed dye effluent at 0th min, 5th min and 10th min of ozone exposure.  211 
3. Results and Discussion  212 
3.1. Characterization of the mono, di and poly azo dyes: RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80  213 
The stability of the mono (RO 16), di (RR 120) and poly (DR 80) azo dye solutions at 214 
varied pH  (3.0 to 11.0)  and temperature range  (20°C to 60°C)  was studied. From th e spectral 215 
graphs , it was observed that the absorption spectra of the dye solutions at different pH ’s and 216 
temperature s were similar . This  shows that the dye molecules are stable at various pH and 217 
temperature conditions. The absorption spectra of the untreated and the treated dye solutions of 218 
RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 were given in the f igure 1a, 1c and 1e, respectively . The maximum 219 
absorbance  for R O 16, RR 120 and DR 80 was observed at 494 nm,  536 nm and 528 nm 220 
respectively . The decrease in the intensity  of the peak in the visible region was observed with 221 
respect to increase in the ozone exposure time, whereas new peaks were observed  in the ul traviolet 222 
region. This might be attributed to the breakage of azo bonds ( -N=N -) and formation of 223 
intermediates containing aromatic  ring. 224 11

3.2 Optimisation of process  parameters for  the degradation of azo dyes by ozonolysis  226 
3.2.1.  Effect of exposure time  227 
Table 3  illustrates the influence of ozone exposure time on the degradation of RO 16, RR 228 
120 and DR 80. From the results , at pH 11.0  and 10 minutes exposure  time, 98.4% (492 .11 mg/L) , 229 
94.93 % (474.64  mg/L) and 85.58 % (495.4 mg/L) degradation was observed in RO 16,  RR 120 230 
and DR 80 respectively. Interestingly, after 20 minutes of ozone exposure, more than 99% of 231 
RO16, RR120 and DR80 dyes were degraded. It could  be inferred that, at lower exposure time, 232 
the difference of 15% was observed in the degradation of dyes as  the complexity increases. The 233 
prolonged exposure of ozone completely degrades all the classes of dyes. The minimum  time 234 
required to degrade maximum concentration of the mono azo dye  (RO 16 ) is relatively less than 235 00.511.522.5

 that for the degradation of di azo (RR 12 0) and poly azo (DR 80) dyes. The possible reason for the 236 
difference in degradation could be  the complexity in the structure of the dye molecules.  237

3.2.2.  Effect of initial pH  238 
The effect of pH on the ozonolysis of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 was studied and the results 239 
are shown in Table 4. pH of the solu tion influences the degradation  by altering the chemical nature  240 
of ozone. At acidic pH, ozone tends to remai n in the molecular state and oxidizes the dye molecules 241 
through selective reactions such as electrophilic, nucleophilic or dipolar addition reaction (direct 242 
oxidation pathway). Indirect r adical oxidation pathway predominates at alkaline pH because at 243 
alkal ine pH, ozone is unstable and rapidly decomposes into hydroxyl radical , which is the chief 244 
oxidant in indirect oxidation.  From the results (Table 4) it is evident that, the degradation of azo 245 
dyes is more efficient at alkaline pH. The oxidation potential o f hydroxyl radical (E 0 = 2.8) is 246 
greater than that of ozone (E 0 = 2.1), this might be the reason for the faster and efficient 247 
mineralization of the azo dyes at alkaline pH than acidic pH [6, 8, 29]. 248

            The influence of initial dye concentration on the degradation  of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 259 
was studied and the results are shown in the Table 5. The concentration of dye degraded increases 260 
with resp ect to increase in t he initial concentration of dye irrespective of all types of azo dyes. In 261

concentration of dye degraded increased with the increasing initial dye concentration over the 264 
experimental range f  or all the azo dyes .  265

second order polynomial equations . The polynomial equations , which explain the degradation of 269 
RO 16 ( Mono), RR 120 (Di) and DR 80 (Poly) azo dyes were transformed to log 10 scale  based on  270 
the Box -Cox plot (Figures 2e, 3e and 4e)  and given in the equations 9, 10 and 11  respectively . 271 
These equations are used to relate  the dependent variable (concentration of the degraded dye) and 272 
the independent variables involved in the process.    273

The factors that a positive  influence o n the degradation of RO 16 , RR 120 and DR 80 are A, B and 275 
C. In addition , the interactive effect of AB and BC had positive influence on the degradation of 276 
the RO 16 and RR 120 azo dyes . The factors which negatively influence s the degradation  of RO 277 
16, RR 120 and DR 80 are A2, B2 and AC. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to determine 278 
the importance and adequacy of the developed models [30]. Tables 6, 7 and 8  summarises the 279 
results of ANOVA for the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 by Ozonolysis . The Fischer 280 
variance ratio (F -value) is the ratio of mean square value due to model variation to mean square 281 
value due to error variance [30]. It explains  the variation in data about its mean [26, 31]. The 282 
significance of each coefficient in the models can be interpreted from the P -value. It facilitates the 283 
understanding of mutual interactions between the test variables. The variables whose coefficien ts 284 
have larger F -value and lower P -value are considered to be more significant in comparison with 285 
the other variables [23]. The significant model terms with P va lue < 0.05 are listed in Table 6, 7 286 
and 8 . From the results , it can be inferred that pH (A) is the most significant linear parameter which  287 
had greater influence than initial dye concentration (B) and ozone ex posure time (C) in the 288 
degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 dyes . Similarly, AC was found to be the highly 289 
significant interactive term in the degradation of all the three classes of azo dye s used in the study . 290 
R2 values obtained in the present study for the degradation of RO  16, RR 120 and DR 80 are 291 
0.9814, 0.9815 and 0.9685 , respectively. These results implies that, the response values 292 
(concentration of dye degraded mg/L) can be computed with 9 8.14%, 98.15% and 9 6.85% of 293 
variations by the independent variables and their interactions in the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 294 17 
 and DR 80 dyes , respectively. The difference between the adjusted R2 and predicted R2 in the 295 
models should be less than 0.20 to confirm the reliabil ity of the model [26, 32]. In the present 296 
study, adjusted R2 and predicted R2 are in good agr eement (Table 4, 5 and 6 ) which proves that, 297 
the models developed are reliable. The signal to noise ratio (Adequate precision) should have a 298 
value greater than 4 [33].  31.611, 31.327 and 29.68  are the adequate precision of RO 16, RR 120 299 
and DR 80 respectively, this indicates the fitn ess of the model. The accuracy of the models are 300 
apparent from the relatively less coeffic ient of variation (C.V %), 1.83 (RO 16), 1.88 (RR 120) 301 
and (DR 80) 2.57  [25, 34]. This shows the applicability of all the develope d models.  302

 Figure 2a, 3a and 4a represents the graphical plot between the predicted and experimental values 306 
for the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 respectively. From t he figures , it is inferred that  307 
the predicted and the experimental values are in good agreem ent signifying the fitness of the 308 
models. Figure 2b, 3b and 4b shows the plots of normal probability of the response (concentration 309 
of dye degraded) versus the internally studentized residuals for the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 310 
and DR 80 respectively. The figures show  that the residual points are in close proximity to the 311 
straight trend line as there is no disperse effect. The residuals are plotted against the predicted 312 
response values (Figure 2c, 3c and 4c) and the run number (Figure 2d, 3d and 4d). It can be 313 
observed  that the residuals are dispersed randomly within the constant range of ± 3.00 across the 314 
graphs. This shows that the variance of the original observations are constant for all the responses 315 
and the error in the experimental system is negligible [35]. 316

 3.3.2.  Interactive effect of process parameters on the degradation of azo dyes  320 
           The interactive effect between  two parameters was studied using contour (2D) plots and 321 
response surface plots (3D). In these plots two parameters are varied within the experimental range 322 
and the third parameter is kept constant [36]. From the results (Table 6, 7 and 8 ), it is clear  that the 323 
interactive effect (AB) of pH with initial dye concentration and (BC) of initial dye concentration 324 
with the ozone exposure time do not have significant influence on the degradation of DR 80 (poly 325 
azo dye)  and hence the model  was reduced. O n the other -hand all the interactions (AB, AC and 326 
BC) were found to be significant in the models developed for th e degradation of RO 16 and RR 327 
120.  328 
Interactive effect of AB:  The contour and response surface plots which show  the interactive effect 329 
(AB) of pH (A) and initial dye concentration (B) on the degradation of RO 16 and  RR 120 are 330 
represented by the figures 5a, 5b and 6a, 6 b respectively. The interactive effect  of AB on the 331 
degradation RO 16 and  RR 120 substantiates that  the concentration of dye degraded increases as  332 
the pH increases from 3.0 to 11 .0 for the studied range of initial d ye concentration (500 mg/L to 333 
2000 mg/L). The rate of decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals is greater at alkaline pH, 334 
this might be the reason for the accelerated degradation of the organic pollutants at high pH [6]. 335 
Interactive effect of BC:  The influence of BC ( initial dye concentration and Ozone exposure time) 336 
on the degradation of RO 16 (Fig ures 5c and 5 d), and RR 120  (Figures 6 c and 6d) reveals that the 337 
time required for degra ding the dye increases  with the incre asing initial dye concentration  [6]. 338 
Exposure time is directly proportional to the concentration of ozone and hydroxyl radicals , i.e. 339 
shorter exposure time is sufficient  for degrading lower concentration of dye while  longer time of 340 
ozone exposure is desirable for degrading higher dye concentration. At minimal exposure time of 341 
10 mins ( initial dye concentration = 500 mg/L, pH = 11.0), about 96.8% (484.17  mg/L ) of RO 16 342 
and 94.4% (472.06  mg/L) of RR 120  was degraded. Furthermore, the ozone exposure time required 343 
is relatively high for degrading dyes of higher concentration ( initial dye concentration = 2000 344 24 
 mg/L, pH = 11.0) i.e. 30 mins for degrading 93.5% (1870.68  mg/L ) of RO 16 and 89.7%  (1794.73 345 
mg/L ) of RR 120 .  346 
Interactive effect of AC: The interactive effect (AC) of pH (A) and ozone exposure time (C) on 347 
the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR  80 are shown in the figures 5e, 5 f; 6e, 6f and 7a, 7b  348 
respectively. These plots reveal that as the pH of the dye solutions approaches higher ra nge of pH 349 
from 3 .0 to 11.0, the concentration of degraded dye increases irrespective of the ozone exposure 350 
time at a constant initial dye concentration of 1250  mg/L. In addition,  it was also observed that as 351 
the initial pH of the  RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 dye solutions (initial dye concentration= 1250  352 
mg/L) increased from 3.0 to 11.0, the concentration of degraded dye increased by 4-5 folds at 10th 353 
minute of ozone exposure and 2 fold increase was observed at 30th minute of ozone exposure.  The 354 
influence of pH was highly signi ficant at lower exposure time than at higher time of exposure.  As 355 
such, this suggests that the processing time for dye degradation can be decreased when the 356 
treatment is performed at pH 11.  357

 3.3.4 Process optimisation and confirmation  408 
           The parameters influencing the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 azo dyes by 409 
Ozonolysis  were optimised for maximum degrad ation of dye within minimal time of ozone 410 
exposure. The optimal condition obtained for th e degradation of all the three classes of azo dyes 411 
are as follows: Initial dye concentration = 2000 mg/L, pH = 11 and ozone exposure time = 10 412 
mins. Under the condition mentioned above, the response (i.e. concentration of degraded dye) 413 
predicted by the mod els for the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 are 1285.28  mg/L, 414 
1227.43  mg/L and 1035.14  mg/L respectively. In addition, the response predicted by the models 415 
were experimentally verified under the optimal condition and the concentration of dye degraded 416 
obtained for the degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 are as follows: 1289.35  mg/L, 1224. 98 417 
mg/L and 1039.87  mg/L. The difference between the experimental and predicted response of RO 418 
16, RR 120 and DR 80 are 4 mg/L, 3 mg/L and 4 mg/L respectively. This confirms the accuracy 419 
and applica bility of the developed models.  420

 3.4. Kinetics of Ozonolytic degradation   423 
Based on the  optimal condition from  RSM -CCD , rate of degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and 424 
DR 80 was determined. The results are shown in Table 10. It was observed that, all the 425 
experimental runs followed a pseudo -first order kinetic model , which is in accordance with the 426 
earlier reported studi es [19, 37-40]. Despite the complexity in the structure, the rate of degradation 427 
of the poly (DR 80) and di azo (RR 120) dyes were  found to be greater than the rate of degradation 428 
of the mono (RO 16) azo dye.  It is speculated that intermediate products formed during the 429 
ozonation of DR 80  and RR 120  might have catalysed the formation of hydroxyl radicals  thus 430 
increasing the ozonation  reaction [16]. 431

3.5. Ozonolytic degradation in  simulated industrial  dye effluent  433 
The efficiency of the developed process is evaluated in simulated industrial  dyes, which 434 
mimics the  industrial  effluent discharged  from textile industries . The simulated effluent contains 435 
a mixture of dyes and was o zonated at the optimal condition obtained from RSM to determine the 436 
applicability and efficiency of the models . The spectral graph for the d egradation of synthetic 437 
mixed dye effluen t is shown in Figure 8 . At 0th minute, a prominent and intense peak was observed 438 
in the visible region at 500 nm, this peak attributes to azo linkage. After 5th min and 10th min of 439 31 
 ozone exposure, intensity of the p eak in the visible region decreased.  This indicates the breakage 440 
of chromophoric ( -N=N -) azo group by the hydroxyl radicals, which is the first step in the 441 
degradation of organic dye molecules. With the increase in ozone exposure time, new peaks 442 
appeared i n the ultraviolet region around 200 -300 nm along with the simultaneous decrease of 443 
peaks in the visible region. This might be due to the formation of multi -substituted benzene rings 444 
resulting from the degradation of naphthalene rings present in the parent dye molecule. This result 445 
proves  the effectiveness of the process developed by RSM in degrading the textile dye effluent.  446

mg/L) and DR 80 (666.3 mg/L) ) exposed to ozone for 10 mins at pH = 11.  
4. Conclusion  447 
 The degradation of mono, di and poly azo dyes such as RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 was 448 
studied by A dvanced Oxidation Process - Ozonation. Response Surface Methodology using Box - 449 
Wilson Face Centred Central Composite Design (CCF) was found to be effective in studying the 450 
interactive effect of the process parameters (pH, initial dye concentration and ozone  exposure time) 451 
and in optimizing the process of degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 by Ozonolysis . The 452 
highest desirable response (i.e. concentration of dye degraded) predicted by the models for the 453 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6

 degradation of RO 16, RR 120 and DR 80 are 1289.35 mg /L, 1224.98 mg/L and 1039.87 mg/L 454 
respectively. In addition the model predicted by CCD  was validated by partial derivative based 455 
equation modelling. The response obtained from partial derivative based modelling were 456 
experimentally verified and found to be  in agreement  with the predicted response. The d egradation 457 
of dyes followed a pseudo -first order kinetic trend. The applicability of the process was evaluated  458 
using  synthetic mixed dye effluent . Thus the study was successful in developing a potent zero 459 
discharge technology such as ozonation for textile dye degradation at laboratory scale. Upon 460 
establishing the scale -up criteria and studying the effect of other salts present in the real -time 461 
efflue nt, Ozone oxidation technology can be applied in the textile industries for effluent treatment.  462
