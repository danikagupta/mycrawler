Miniaturized standard Ames test
for the evaluation of textile dyes
The Salmonella reverse mutation assay (Ames test, OECD 471) ts a stan-
dard assay for the examination of mutagenic effects in chemicals, e.g. in the
European REACh strategy. In the project'Novel Sustainable Bioprocesses for
European Color Industry' (Sophied, NMP2-CT-2004-505899) a fast muta-
genicity test was needed for the screening of huge amounts of newly de-
veloped textile dye samples where only small sample volumes were avail-
able. The standard Ames test [1] was therefore compared with a miniatur-
ized test version (mini Ames test). lt could be shown, that the mini Ames
test is a suitable test method for fast mutagenicity screening of colored sam-
oles. lt needs less material and less time effort than the standard version
and is therefore very cost effective.

The traditional color industry was a major
branch of industry in Europe until the end of
the 20th century. Nowadays in Europe, a de-
cline of business in favor of the developing
world is taking place due to increasing envi-
ronmental pollution control measures as well
as high labor costs in Europe.
For the evaluatton of the detoxification of
wastewaters during the purification process,
and of the toxicity of dye molecules and tex-
tile auxiliaries, several endpoints such as tox-
icity, ecotoxicity, and biodegradation/elimi-
nation have to be examined. One important
factor in the evaluation process of textile
dyes is the knowledge of mutagenic effects.
Mutagenic dyes are a risk for the health of
workers and consumers and for the environ-
ment. Especially workers can be exposed to
high concentrations when preparing the
recipes for the dyeing process. Mutagenicity
of chemicals present on textiles can be seen
as a major clue towards carcinogenic activi-
ties of these chemicals. Different researchers
have identified mutagenic effects of textile
dyes 12-51. In a research project, 281 textile
dye products were examined for available
published and unpublished data [6-8] 53
dye products not investigated so far for mu-
tagenicity were selected for testing in the
Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium Iol
lowing OECD 41 1.fhe results confirmed pre-
vious findings that there are dye products on
the market which are not sufficiently tested
and show mutagenic effects in in vitro tests.
ln addition, the new European Strategy ol
Chemistry, REACh [9], for Registration, Evalu-ation, and Authorization of Chemicals en-
hanced the constraints for the coloration in-
dustry. Moreover, during dyeing processes,
approx. 1O-40 o/o of the dyes are not bound
on the substrate to which they are applied,
and find their way into wastewaters.
The standard test version is performed with
common Petri dishes. Previously, Flamand et
al. 112l described the mini Ames test proce-
dure as a screening test in the development
of pharmaceuticals. This mini version uses
6-well micro-plates as shown in the picture,
and a reduced test voiume.
A reduction to one plate per strain and con-
centration is achieved instead of 6 Petri dish-
es in the standard plate incorporation assay.
In the European Pro.lect developing 'Novel
Sustainable Bioprocesses for European Color
Industry' (Sophied, NMP2-CT-2004-505899)a fast mutagenicity test for the screening of
huge amounts of colored samples with only
small sample volumes was required. The
standard Ames test [1] was compared with
the mini Ames test version to investigate if
this test system is also suitable to examine
colored samples.
Results
Comparing investigations standard Ames
test and mini Ames test
The mini Ames and the standard Ames test
were performed in parallelwith the two tester
strains TA9B and TA 100 according to OECD
471 with three mutagenic control substances
2-aminoanthracene, nitrofluorene and sodi-
um azide to determine if the mini Ames test
is as sensitive as the standard version. The re-
sults achieved were quiet similar in both tests.
ln a few cases the mini Ames test shows
lower sensitivity than the standard Ames
(Table 1). Negative results should therefore
be conf irmed in the standard test version.
Mutagenicity testing o{ dyestuffs
12 textile dyes were tested in the mini Ames
test with TA98 and TA100 with and without
59 activation in a concentration of 1,000 pgl
plate (Table 2). Five dyes, Disperse Blue 1, Di-
rect Blue 1, Direct Black 38, Acid Blue 62 and
Acid Red 299, showed an effect which indi-
cate that the dyes have to be classified as
mutagenic in the Ames test. With some dyes

e.g. cytotoxic effects were observed. To con-
firm the results and to ensure that cytotoxic-
ity does not mask mutagenic effects, all dyes
were tested in a concentration range be-
tween 2,000 and 125 pgiplate.
By testing dose-response relationship in de-
tail, comparable results were achieved as in
the first test with 1,000 pg/plate. Acid Blue
62 showed a mutagenic effect in concentra-
tions of 500 and 250 pglplate, Reactive Yel-
low B1 was evaluated as not mutagenic.
Mutagenicity testing of
waste water samples
Colored model waste water samples from
different biotechnical purif ication procedures
were tested before and after the purification
process in the mini and standard Ames test
version. lt could be shown that the mini
Ames test is also suitable to evaluate colored
waste water samples.
Discussion
The Salmonella reverse mutation assay (Ames
test, OECD 411) is a standard assay to detect
mutagenic effects. During the development
process of new chemicals a first screening on
mutagenicity is essential to exclude sub-
stances from further research which do not
meet the requirement of being non-muta-
genic. In addition, there is often only a very
little amount of the new chemical available or
the substances are very expensive at this ear-
ly stage. In recent years several attempts have
been described to miniaturize the Ames test
for a first high throughput screening on mu-
tagenicity (e.9. Miniscreen test: [10], Ames ll
Mutagenicity Assay distributed by Xenomet-
rics (www.xenometrics.ch, 2006), Ames Fluc-
tuation Assay: ['l 1-13]) Flamand et al. l12l
describe a miniaturized Ames plate incorpo-
ration assay for a first screening for point mu-
tagenesis assessment in the development of
new chemicals. This protocol requires five
times less reagents and is performed in six-
well microwell plates. lt is described as suit-
able for all tester strains, as well as those with
low spontaneous mutation rates (e g
TA1 535, TA1 537). Snyder (2004) [14] states
that the concordance between standard
Ames and mini Ames test is extremely high.
The mini Ames test is routineously applied for
pre-screening in drug development (DTC
2006) [1 s]
The mini Ames test system was checked
whether it is suitable to evaluate mutagenic-
ity of newly developed textile dyes.
In a comparative study with positive control
substances in the standard Ames test and the
mini Ames test using the S. typhimurium
strains TASB and TA1 00 it could be shown that
the results were in line. The mini Ames ver-
sion is a suitable tool to detect mutagenicityTable 2
Dyes tested in the Ames test: Data for the stock solutions of 2,000 mg/lin textile dyes and it
can be concluded to
be applicable also for
the testing of other
chemicals and waste
water samples. Sub-
stances which are
mutagenic can be
excluded at the be-
ginning of the devel-
opment process.
Only if a substance
does not show mu-
tagenicity in the mini
Ames it should addi-
tionally be tested in
the standard Ames
test.

parison to the stan-

five-times lower sample amount which is
necessary, the need of less consumable ma-
terial and time and therefore the higher
throughput which results in lower costs. In
the standard Ames test for one substance
tested in one strain 42 Petri dishes are re-
quired. In contrast for the mini Ames version
only seven 6-well micro-plates are needed. In
addition it is estimated that the test can be
performed with a time reduction of 30o/o, re-
spectively also a big expense factor.
The mini Ames test proved to be a suitable
tool to evaluate newly developed dyes and
the efficiency of biotechnological waste
water treatment processes in the textile in-
