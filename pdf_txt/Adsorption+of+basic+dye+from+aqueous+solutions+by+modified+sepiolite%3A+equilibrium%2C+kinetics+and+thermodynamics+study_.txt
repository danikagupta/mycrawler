1. Introduction  
 
    The presence of dyes in wastewater unfortunately causes 
adverse effects in the marine environment [1, 2]. However, 
most of the wastewater treatment technologies are not 
designed for cont aminants of emerging treatment [3, 4]. The 
misuse and less adsorption of dyes lead to high water 
solubility and persistent behavior that present the worldwide 
environmental pollution, which, in turn, causes serious health 
problems  [5]. 
 
    Dyes are widely used in industries such as textiles, leather,  
 
  
 
 
 
printing,   food,   plastics,   etc.   The   removal   of  dyes  from  
industrial wastewaters is a major problem  [6]. Conventional 
methods for the removal of dyes from wastewater include 
adsorption onto solid substrates, chemical coagulation, 
oxidation, filtration and biological treatment  [7, 8].  
 
    Adsorption is one of the effective separation techniques to 
remove organic and inorganic pollutants. Therefore, 
researches have been continued in pursue of cheaper, easily 
obtainable materials for the adsorption of dyes [9, 10].

Background:  Nowadays, the development of new material s is emergent that can be used in 
the adsorption process to remove dyes from the aquatic environment. Therefore, in this 
study,  the performance of raw Kaolin as a low cost adsorbent was evaluated in removing 
Direct Blue 71 (DB71) dye from aqueous solutions.  
Methods: For investigating the adsorption, various parameters were optimized and data 
were adjusted to four isotherm models: Freundlich, Dubinin ‚ÄìRadushkevich, Langmuir an d 
Temkin, in order to determine the one presenting the best adjustment to the experimental 
data. Moreover, the  kinetics study for adsorption was evaluated using diffusion, pseudo -
first-order kinetic and pseudo -second -order kinetic models.  
Results:  The resu lts revealed that at the DB71 concentration of 10 mg/L, adsorbent dose of 
2.5 g/L, and contact time of 75 min, the DB71 removal reached 98.5%. Adsorption data 
fitted best into the Langmuir and D -R adsorption isotherms. The maximum monolayer 
adsorption capa city was 36.41 mg/g. The pseudo second order kinetics best described the 
kinetics of the adsorption system.  
Conclusion:  It was revealed that Kaolin could be applied for DB71 dye removal from 
solution samples with the adsorption capacity of 36.41 mg/g and thus could be used as a 
low-cost and effective adsorbent.

154                                                                                                                                     Journal of Human, Environment  and Health Promotion. 2018; 4(4): 153-8                                                                                                                                      Removal of dyes by adsorption has been extensi vely studied 
in the last years. Activated carbon has been successfully used 
in removing colored organic species while  it is the most 
widely used as adsorbent due to its high capacity of adsorption 
for organic materials  [11]. Howe ver, due to its high cost, an 
effective and cheap adsorbent material is still an urgent need  
[12]. Lately, many local inexpensive materials have been 
studied as new adsorbents to remove pollutants and dyes from 
wastewater [13, 14]. The use of low cost adsorbents, such as 
natural ores, agricultural byproducts and industrial wastes, is 
preferable. Thus, the important task is to develop and improve 
adsorbent materials derived from solid wastes [15]. These 
materials are not expensive a nd can be used for contaminants 
treatment like dyes; moreover, these adsorbents can be the 
solution for treatment of effluents colored by dyes or pigments 
after increasing its performance [16, 17]. 
 
    Clays are strong adsorbents and have been used for de cades 
[18]. Qualities such as chemical and mechanical stability, 
layered structure, ready availability and low cost make them 
an excellent adsorbent for the prevailing en vironmental 
pollution challenge [19, 20]. Their adsorption 
potential/efficiency largel y depends on the surface area as 
well as on exchange capacity [21]. 
 
    Kaolin is a soft white mineral that has a large array of uses. 
In its natural state, Kaolin is a white and soft powder, 
principally consisting of mineral kaolinite, which, under the 
electron microscope, is observed as roughly hexagonal, platy 
crystals ranging in size from about 0.1 micrometer to 10 
micrometers [22]. 
  
    The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of 
Kaolin as a low -cost adsorbent to remove the Direct Blue 71 
(DB71) dye from aqueous solutions. The effect of contact 
time, adsorbent dosage, particle size, and initial DB71 
concentration at fixed temperature and pH was studied to find 
the optimum condition of DB71 dye removal . 
 
2. Materials and Methods  
 
    The nat ural Kaolin clay samples were obtained from Sigma 
Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). Dirts and other unwanted 
materials were removed. The natural Kaolin clay was crushed, 
grinded, oven dried and sieved using the Tyler screen standard 
sieve of various sizes (4 -80 mesh).  
2.1. Preparation of Adsorbate  
 
    The Direct Blue 71 dye (CAS Number 4399 -55-7, 
C40H28N7NaO 13S4, molecular weight of 965.94 g/mol) used in 
this study was obtained from Sigma Aldrich  (Darmstadt, 
Germany) ; the chemical structure of this dye is shown in 
Figure 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     All the chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade. To 
prepare a dye solution, 1 g of  dye  powder  was  dissolved  in 
 1 L of distilled water to obtain the concentration of a stock 
solution with 1000 mg/L. Stock solution diluted to obtain the 
required concentrations range (10 -100) mg/L in the 
experiments [8].  
 
2.2. Adsorption Procedure  
 
  For each experimental run, 0.25 g of raw Kaolin (RK)  
powder with particle size was 75 Œºm added to 100 mL conical 
flask; then, 25 mL of the dye aqueous solution (10 mg/L) was 
added and the flask was tightly closed. These flasks were 
shaken at 200 rpm (Cent ric 400R model) at room temperature 
for a predetermined contact time. After that, they were 
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The pH of the solutions 
in all the adsorption processes was adjusted by adding 0.1 
mol/L NaOH or 0.1 mol/L HCL (7). The dye conc entration in  
the aqueous phase was determined by a UV 
spectrophotometer at (Œªmax= 576 nm). The removal percentage 
(%R) of dye was calculated by the following equation (15):  
 
% R= [ùê∂0‚àíùê∂ùëí
ùê∂ùëí]√ó100                                                       (1) 
 
    C0 (mg/L) and Ce (mg/L) are the concentrations of DB71 
in the initial solution and at equilibrium.  The adsorption 
capacity (q e) of dye  by the R K adsorbent (mg/g) was 
calculated using the following equation (15):  
 
qe = [ùê∂0‚àíùê∂ùëí
ùëö]ùëâ                                                                          (2)  
 
    Where, q e (mg/g) is the amount of dye (mg) adsorbed onto 
a unit mass of the Kaolin (g) at equilibrium;  C0 (mg/L) and C e 
(mg/L) are the concentrations of DB71 in the initial solution 
and at equilibrium; m (g) is the amount of adsorbent used V 
(L) is the volu me of dye solution.   
 
3. Results and Discussion  
 
3.1. Characterization of Raw Kaolin (RK)  
 
    The specific surface area and porosity are the foremost 
characteristics of adsorbents. In the present study, the specific 
surface area and pore volume were estimated at 39.4 m2/g and 
0.036 ml/g, respectively . The SEM image of RK (Figure  2) 
showed an unevenly distributed cloudl ike nature with hollows 
and pores.  
 
3.2. Effect of Contact Time  
 
    The effect of contact time on removal of dye was studied 
and is shown in Figure  3. This figure indicates that the dye 
concentration in aqueous solutions rapidly decreases at the 
beginning and remains almost constant after 75 min; this is 
attributed to the large surface area of the adsorbent existing at 
the beginning of adsorption [23]. Moreover, the fast 
adsorption at the initial stage was due to the existence of large 
amount of adsorption sites. Thus, the progressive decrease of 
adsorption sites resulted in a slower adsorption reaction [24].

3.2. Effect of Contact Time  
 
    The effect of contact time on removal of dye was studied 
and is shown in Figure  3. This figure indicates that the dye 
concentration in aqueous solutions rapidly decreases at the 
beginning and remains almost constant after 75 min; this is 
attributed to the large surface area of the adsorbent existing at 
the beginning of adsorption [23]. Moreover, the fast 
adsorption at the initial stage was due to the existence of large 
amount of adsorption sites. Thus, the progressive decrease of 
adsorption sites resulted in a slower adsorption reaction [24]. 
 
3.3. Effect of Adsorbent Dosage  
 
    The effect of adsorbent dosage on the removal of the DB71 
dye w as studied and is shown in Figure 4. As shown in the 
figure, an increase was observed in the removal percentage of 
the DB71 dye with the increase of adsorbent dose until it 
asymptotically reached 9 8.5%. This may be due to an increase 
in the availability of surface active sites with the increase of 
the dose [25]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.4. Effect of Particle Size  
 
    Adsorption of the DB71 dye was studied on five particle 
sizes of adsorbent . The results are shown in Figure 5. It was 
observed from Figure  5 that the dye percentage removal 
decreased with increasing the particle size of the adsorbent. 
The decrease in particle size led to an increase of available 
active sites on the surface of the adsorbent and, consequently, 
an increase in the adsorption pro cess on the RK surface due 
to the high surface area [26,  27]. Furthermore, the diffusional 
resistance to mass transfer increa sed by increasing particle 
size the beginning of adsorption [23]. Moreover, the fast 
adsorption at the initial stage was due to th e existence of large 
amount of adsorption sites.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.5. Adsorption Isotherm Models  
 
    For the design of adsorption systems, adsorption isotherm 
models are very important. This tool provides useful 
information regarding maximum adsorption capacity and the 
expected interactions between adsorbates and adsorbents . 
Here,   four   isotherm   models, i.e.,   Langmuir,   Freundlich, 
Dubinin ‚ÄìRadushkevich (D ‚ÄìR), and Temkin, were applied to 
evaluate equilibrium experimental data. The Langmuir

154                                                                                                                                     Journal of Human, Environment  and Health Promotion. 2018; 4(4): 153-8                                                                                                                                    isotherm elaborates on the formation of monolayer adsorption 
of molecules due t o all the binding sites showing an equal 
affinity for sorbate molecules. Equation 3 represents the linear 
form for the Langmuir isotherm [28]: 
 
Ce
qe = 1
qmKL  + Ce

    where C e is the concentration of DB71 at equilibrium 
(mg/L), q e is the adsorption capacity (mg/g), qm represents 
the maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g) , and K L is the 
Langmuir isotherm constant [24]:  
 
RL = 1
1+KLC0                                                                              (4) 
 
    C0 (mg/L)   is  the  concentrations   of   dye   in   the   initial 
solution.  
 
    The separation factor (R L) is a dimensionless equilibrium 
parameter which may be used to  calculate favorability of the 
adsorption process from the expression . 
 
RL = 0 is irreversible isotherm  
RL = 1 is linear isotherm  
RL > 1 is unfavorable isotherm  
 
0 < R L< 1 is favorable isotherm The heterogeneous surfaces 
adsorption is mainly determined using the Freundlich 
isotherm which tells about the adsorption sites of different 
attraction. Using the linear form in Eq. (5), this isotherm could 
be assessed as [20]: 
 
Log q e  =  1
n log C e + log KF                                                                                     (5) 
 
    where C e is the concentration at equilibrium (mg/L), K F 
denotes multilayer adsorption capacity, and (1/n) is the 
intensity of adsorption . 
 
    Dubinin ‚ÄìRadushkevich (D -R) (Eqs. 6 and 7) is known to 
be more generalized than the Langmuir isotherm; it easily 
distinguishes the physicochemical adsorption process because 
it is not dependent on ideal assumptions, e.g., absence of steric 
hindrances betwee n adsorbates and incoming particles, 
surface homogeneity on microscopic level, and equipotential 
of adsorption sites [29]: 
 
Ln q e = Ln q m - K
                                                               (6) 
 
Œµ = RT Ln (1+1
 Ce)                                                                  (7) 
 
    The difference between saturated liquid phase and 
frequently adsorbate phase is known as adsorption potential, 
as proposed by Polanyi. The total specific micropore volume 
of the ads orbent is represented by q m (saturation limit) . 
Equation 8 is applied to calculate the mean free energy E 
(kJ/mol).  
 E =  1
‚àö2ùêµ                                                                           (8) 
 
    If the activation energy E  < 8 KJ/mol, the adsorption 
process is physisorption and if E is in between 8 -16 KJ/mol, 
the process is chemisorptions in nature.  
 
    The relationship between adsorbent ‚Äìadsorbate interactions 
on surfaces and heat of adsorption is well described by the 
Temkin equation.  It suggests that heat of adsorption of all 
molecules decreased linearly with completion of adsorption 
sites in the adsorbent. Equation 9 is the Temkin isotherm 
which is given below [24]:  
 
qe = B Ln A+ B Ln Ce                B = ( RT)/b                        (9) 
 
    Table 1 shows the values of adsorption constants of all the 
models which give an idea concerning the favorability and 
unfavorability of the process. The plot of C e/C0 versus C e (this 
Figure is not shown), yielded a straight line, indic ating that 
the experimental data tabulated in Table 1 appeared to follow 
the Langmuir isotherm. Moreover, the calculated values of R L 
were less than 1 at all the concentrations, which also 
represented the favorable adsorption of DB71 onto R K. 
 
    The Freu ndlich isotherm equation was applied to validate 
the adsorption of DB71; as a result, a linear plot was obtained. 
The calculated values of adsorption intensity (1/n) were 
greater than 0 and less than 1, indicating the favorability of 
the adsorption. The re gression coefficient R2 = 0.884 gave 
validation of experimental data. The adsorption intensity of 
the Freundlich constant (n) was found to be 2.65; the n value 
did not lie in the 1 -10 range, indicating the favorable 
adsorption . 
 
    A plot of Ln Cads versus Œµ2 (this Figure is not shown), 
yielded a straight line; from the slope and intercept, Œ≤ and qm 
values were calculated, respectively (Table 1). The magnitude 
of free energy (E) plays an important role in evaluating the 
kind of adsorption. Hence, in t his case, the value of E was 3.25 
kJ/mol pertaining to the applicability of experimental data for 
the D ‚ÄìR isotherm and it described that the process was 
physio -adsorption in nature . 
 
    Furthermore, Table 1 also shows the comparison of R2 of 
all the isoth erms. The favorability order on the basis of 
regression   coefficients    is      as      follows:          Langmuir    
(R2 = 0.995)  > D-R  (R2 = 0.912)  > Freundlich (R2 = 0.884) >     
Temkin (R2 = 0.824).  
 
    Therefore, each isotherm has appropriate merits in 
describing the potential of F K for the adsorption of DB71. The 
values of the correlation coefficient indicated that the 
adsorption process was compatible, feasible and experimental 
data followed the D ‚ÄìR and Langmuir isotherm models. Table 
2 shows a comparison between the adsorption cap acities of 
the F K adsorbent used in this work with other adsorbents

3.6. Adsorption Kinetic Models  
 
    The kinetic study for the adsorption of DB71 on to the FK 
was carried out at a fixed initial concentration to investigate 
the controlling mechanism as a  function of different 
concentration, i.e., 10 -100 mg/L. This parameter is important 
for evaluating the adsorption phenomenon followed by 
sorbate molecules to attach on the adsorbent surface. In order 
to evaluate the adsorption kinetics, the effect of agit ation time 
was observed from 10 to 150 min. In kinetic study, the rate of 
adsorption of DB71 onto FK was determined by using 
different kinetic models such as pseudo -first-order kinetic,  
pseudo -second -order kinetic and diffusion models. The 
pseudo -first-order and  second -order kinetic equations are 
given as Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively [30]: 
 
Log (qe ‚Äì qt) = log qe ‚Äì K1

    qe and qt are the amount of dye adsorbate on the adsorbent 
(mg/g) at equilibrium and the time t, respectively, and K 1 
(1/min) and K 2 (g/mol/min) are the adsorption rate constants. 
Qe, K 1, and K 2 were obtained from the slope and intercept of 
the linear plots of (q e - qt) versu s t and t/qt versus t (this Figure  
is not shown).  
 
 
 
4. Conclusion  
 
    In our study, RK as an adsorbent had a high potential for 
removing of the DB71 dye from the aqueous solution. The 
kinetics of the DB71 adsorption was examined by using the 
pseudo -first order and pseudo -second order and diffusion 
kinetic models under different conditions. The results of 
adsorption kinetic of the DB71 dye in the aqueous solution 
followed the pseudo -second order model. Moreover, the data 
were evaluated by using the Langmuir, Freundli ch, D -R, and 
Temkin models.  The  values   of  the    correlation    coefficient  
indicated   that   the   adsorption  process  was  compatible  and 
  
Kinetic parameters along with correlation coefficients of 
kinetic models are given in Table 3. It is noted that R2 values 
of the pseudo -first-order kinetic model at different 
concentrations may not well explain the kinetics of adsorption 
whereas the pseudo -second -order explain the kinetics of 
adsorption whereas the pseudo -second -order model R2 values 
better exp lain the adsorption manner relative to the former 
one. The later one describes the rate -limiting step as physical 
adsorption based on physical interaction of adsorbate -
adsorbent molecules. Moreover, the pseudo -second -order 
kinetic model describes adsorptio n as purely physical in 
nature as supported by physical interaction between DB71 
and FK. Both the kinetic models do not recognize the 
diffusion mechanism; hence, kinetic results were evaluated 
with diffusion models [26]: 
 
qt = K d t 0.5+ C                                                                    (12) 
 
    Here, q t is the adsorbed concentration at the time t, while 
Kd is known as the intra -particle diffusion rate constant. From 
the linear plot of qt versus t1/2 (this Figure  is not shown), it was 
observed that lines did not pass the origin, suggesting that for 
adsorption of DB71 onto FK, the intra -particle diffusion was 
not only the rate -limiting step and some degree of boundary 
layers also controlled the process.  
 
 
 
 
feasibl e and also the experimental data followed the D -R and 
Langmuir isotherm models.
