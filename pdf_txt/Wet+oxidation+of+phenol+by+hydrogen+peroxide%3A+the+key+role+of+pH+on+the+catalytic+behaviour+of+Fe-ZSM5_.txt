In this work, catalytic activity and stability of Cu/Y5 and Cu/ZSM5 zeolites in phenol oxidation with hydrogenperoxide were examined. The catalyst samples were prepared by the ion exchange method of the protonic formof commercial zeolites. The catalysts were characterized by the  powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), AAS, whilethe adsorption techniques were used to measure the specific surface area.The thermal programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was used for measuring the total number of acid sitesformed on the surface of zeolites.Catalytic performance of the prepared samples was monitored in terms of phenol, hydrogen peroxide and totalorganic carbon (TOC) conversion, by-product distribution and a degree of copper leached into the aqueoussolution.It was found that the activity of Cu/Y5 catalyst was generally higher than that of Cu/ZSM5 and that unlike Cu/ZSM5, Cu/Y5 catalyzed phenol oxidation more completely.

INTRODUCTION
Disposal of wastewater streams containing highly toxic
organic pollutants generated by many industrial processeshas become a growing concern in recent years. Amongnumerous classes of pollutants, phenols present a particularissue due to their being widely discharged into the environ-ment and due to their toxicity to many living organisms.The effective removal of such pollutants, from the safetyaspect is a challenging task given the increasingly stringentenvironmental laws and regulations. Biotreatment, adsorp-tion and incineration have been traditionally applied forthe purpose of their legal compliance
1. However, toxic
pollutants are lethal to the microorganisms employed inbioprocesses. On the other hand,  incineration or adsorp-tion merely transfer pollutants from a liquid to air or to asolid leaving,  combustion by-products or a contaminatedadsorbent for further disposal. Therefore, there is a clearneed in testing and setting up the emerging alternative tech-nologies that can deal with highly concentrated and/or toxicnon-biodegradable organic water pollutants. Wet air oxida-tion (WAO) is an attractive method for the treatment ofwaste streams that are too diluted to be incinerated and tootoxic to be treated biologically. The use of catalysts makesthe process more attractive by achieving high conversion ata considerably lower temperature (353–473 K) and pres-sure (1–10 MPa).  An alternative process that allows oxi-dation at the ambient or close-to-the-ambient conditions,thus limiting the investment costs, involves hydrogen per-oxide as an oxidant in the so-called catalytic wet peroxideoxidation (CWPO). Hydrogen peroxide does not form anyharmful by-products, and is a non-toxic and ecologicalreactant. Although, it is a relatively costly reactant, theperoxide oxidation compares very favorably to the proc-esses that use gaseous oxygen. The lack of gas-liquid bound-ary removes mass transfer limitation and the hydrogenperoxide acts as a free radical initiator, providing hydroxylradicals that promote phenol degradation.Although the homogeneous catalyst applied in CWPO
processes demonstrates a high efficiency, their recoveryfrom the treated effluent is rather difficult and requires anadditional process to remove the homogeneous catalyst inthe reactor. This drawback can be overcome by using easilyrecoverable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts. Transi-tion metals, mainly iron and copper, are used as activephases. Many materials containing mainly iron and copperas the precursors supported/intercalated on/in oxides
2,3,
mesoporous molecular sieves4–7, zeolites8–16, pillared
clays17–21, carbon22,23, and resins24–27 are proposed as cata-
lysts for the removal of organic compounds. These catalystsexhibit the advantages of a heterogeneously catalyzed proc-ess. Unlike a homogeneous catalyst they have relativelyhigher oxidation efficiency and lower sensitivity to pH underequal reaction conditions. However, during oxidation mostof them suffer from deactivation caused by the leaching ofa metal cation in contact with a hot acidic medium used inheterogeneous catalytic oxidation
13,14,16,23,27–29. Therefore,
the preparation of efficient and durable catalysts is still achallenge to the  development of an advantageous catalystfor the oxidation for phenolic wastes.
T aking into account that the phenol is one of the most
prevalent forms of toxic and poorly biodegradable chemi-cal pollutants from industrial activities it is chosen as themodel pollutant. The aim of the work is to use the copper-containing ZSM5 and Y5 zeolites in the CWPO of phenolin a batch reactor.  The results will be analyzed in termsof phenol and TOC conversion as well as the hydrogenperoxide consumption. The efficient use of the oxidant willbe assessed. Identification of the intermediate species willbe carried out. Special attention will be paid towards evalu-ation of the catalyst stability in terms of copper leachinginto the reaction mixture.Pol.

EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst synthesis
The catalysts were prepared from the protonic forms of
commercial ZSM5 (Leuna Werke), and Y5 (Süd Chemie)zeolites with different SiO
2/Al2O3 ratio. They were in the
powder form. Ion exchange with copper acetate solutionwas carried out at 298 K over 24 hours and then thesamples were dried 10 hours at the room temperature
14.
Catalyst characterization
Characterization of the samples was performed by a dif-
ferent conventional technique. Crystalline structures of allthe prepared catalysts were checked by the X-ray diffrac-tion analysis. The XRD patterns were obtained with PhilipsPW 1830 diffractometer using Ni-filtered CuK α radiation
operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. The data were collectedfrom 2θ ranging from 5° to 40° with resolution of 0.02°.
The surface morphology of the catalysts  was examined
using a FEG Quanta 200F FEI/Phillips  scanning electronmicroscope (SEM).
T extural characterization of the catalyst samples was
performed by means of nitrogen adsorption/desorption iso-therms at 77 K using Micromeritics ASAP 2000. Thecatalysts were degassed under vacuum for 5 h at 623 Kprior to N2 adsorption measurements. The total sorbedvolumes, including adsorption in the micropores andmesopores and on the external surface, were calculatedfrom the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at relative pressurep/p
0 of 0.96 before the onset of interparticle condensation.
Chemical composition of the catalysts was determined by
atomic absorption spectrometry using Perkin Elmer AAS3110 and ICP-MS analyzer.
Acidity measurement by temperature-programmed
desorption of NH
3 was carried out using Micromeritics
Pulse Chemisorb 2720 instrument. For NH3-TPD studies,the catalyst was activated in helium flow for 2 h at 673 K.Then the sample was cooled to 373 K before the adsorptionof ammonia. Subsequently, 5% NH
3 with He was passed
through the sample for 30 min to chemisorb ammonia. Theexcess physisorbed ammonia was flushed with helium at393 K. Then the sample was heated at a rate of 10 K min
-1
up to 873 K. The volume of gas desorbed was measured bya detector.
Catalytic evaluation
The catalytic tests were carried out in a stainless steel
Parr reactor in a batch operation mode at the atmosphericpressure, the temperature values of 333, 343 and 353 K andthe stirrer rotational speed of 200 rpm. Phenol degradationexperiments involved an aqueous phenol solution (0.2 dm
3,
0.01 mol dm-3). The solid catalyst (0.10 g dm-3) was sus-
pended in the solution under continuous stirring. When thereaction mixture was heated to a desired temperature hy-
drogen peroxide (0.10 mol dm-3) was added to initiate the
reaction. The pH was not adjusted during the reactionperiod, but pH was measured and recorded.During thereaction aliquots were withdrawn at the predetermined timeintervals and filtered by means of 0.2 μm nylon membrane
to analyze the reaction mixture. Decreases in phenol con-centration, and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide wereanalytically monitored. Phenol and its conversion productswere analyzed with HPLC chromatograph equipped with aWaters Spherisorb ODS2C column.  The major detectedproducts were: catechol, hydroquinone, maleic acid, oxalicacid and acetic acid. Hydrogen peroxide concentration wasfollowed by a colorimetric method using a UV-1650PCShimadzu spectrophotometer. T otal organic carbon (TOC)was determined with a TOC-V CSN Shimadzu analyzer.Copper content in the filtered solution after reaction wasdetermined by atomic absorption Perkin Elmer 2380.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of the prepared catalysts
The physicochemical properties of the catalysts used in
this study are listed in T able 1.
As it can be seen the BET surface area, the pore volume
and acidity of ZSM5 were lower than those of Y5.  Thetests showed that the BET surface area of zeolites de-creased with the copper loading. It had been expected thatmore pore cavities in the zeolite would be blocked byaddition of metal ions, causing reduced accessibility ofnitrogen as observed from the lower BET surface area.T able 1 shows the total number of acid sites formed on thesurface of zeolites as determined from ammonia TPD.Acidity of the zeolite was related to its alumina contentwhereas increase in the overall acidity was expected withincreased aluminium content in the zeolite
30. It can be seen
that the concentration of acid sites of zeolites matrix de-creased with copper loading because the H+ ions whichled to the acidity of the catalyst were replaced by metalions.
In order to check the crystallinity of the samples before
and after ion exchange with copper and the possible forma-tion of copper oxides, the XRD patterns were recorded. Asshown in Fig. 1 no significant difference was found betweenthe diffractograms of the parent zeolites and the catalystsafter ion exchange. Cu/ZSM5 and Cu/Y5 presented crystal-linity between 95 and 100% in relation to the parent zeolitecrystallinity, which indicated that catalyst lattice was prac-tically unperturbed by exchange with copper.
The SEM micrographs of the Cu/ZSM5 and Cu/Y cata-
lysts are shown in Fig. 2.
As shown, the morphology and the size of the crystallites
depended on the SiO
2/Al2O3 ratios. The zeolite with lower
Table 1.  Physicochemical properties of Cu-containing zeolites used in phenol oxidation30 Pol. J. Chem. Tech., Vol. 13, No. 3, 2011
SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (Fig.2B) was constituted by agglomerates
of small crystallites. However, with an increase of that ratio(Fig.2a), the crystals tended to be isolated or to geminatewith morphology of hexagonally prisms as also observed byothers authors
31.
Catalytic activity
A preliminary set of experiments were performed in order
to compare the behavior of the Cu bearing zeolites andpure zeolites, and to discriminate the effect of adsorptionand reaction. These experiments were carried out at 333 K,and other process parameters were as specified in Experi-mental Section ( Catalytic Evaluation ). Phenol conversion
obtained after 180 min of the reaction are shown in T able 2.
As can be seen the experiments carried out with the pure
zeolites gave fairly similar results in the presence and ab-sence of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. This suggests thatthe oxidation of phenol was almost negligible and thatphenol removal took place essentially by adsorption. In theabsence of hydrogen peroxide phenol oxidation on Cu-bearing catalyst was comparable to that observed with thepure support. Thus, again, practically only adsorption musthave occurred. The addition of H
2O2 greatly enhanced
phenol conversion allowing the conclusion that phenol wasbeing transformed through oxidation and that the Cu-bear-ing catalysts were active for that reaction.
Figs. 3 and 4 show the results obtained for phenol and
hydrogen peroxide conversion as a function of the reactiontime and temperature over the catalysts investigated. Ac-cording to the expectation phenol oxidation and H
2O2
decomposition increased markedly with an increase in thereaction temperature from 333 to 353 K.Figure 1. XRD patterns of ZSM5, Y5 and Cu-bearing zeolites

catalysts having a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio equal to: A) 31
and B) 5.2It is well known that the oxidation rate and TOC removal
are strongly dependent on the concentration of hydroxylradicals. The radical concentration usually increases withthe increasing reaction temperature in the CWPO proc-Table 2.  Phenol conversion over Y5 and ZSM5 zeolites, and
Cu bearing zeolites with and without oxidantPol. J. Chem. Tech., Vol. 13, No. 3, 2011 31
esses. However, the higher reaction temperature may en-
hance thermal degradation rate of hydrogen peroxide. There-fore, the oxidation rate of organic compounds should bedependent on the competition between free radical forma-tion and thermal degradation of H
2O2. This means that
phenol conversion might be related to the competitionbetween the thermal decomposition of hydrogen peroxideand the free radical formation as also reported by Dubey atal. 
32. The results of the present study indicate that the rate
of OH. formation was higher than the rate of the thermal
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide  because the decreasein the phenol conversion was not monitored when reactionwas carried out at higher temperature.
Also, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, a Cu/Y5 catalyst oxidized
phenol and decomposed H
2O2 faster than Cu/ZSM5, al-
though both of them possessed practically equal concentra-tion of catalytic active centers. That could be attributed tothe diffusion transport resistance of molecules in the poreof a Cu/ZSM5 catalyst, because a pore diameter of H-MFIzeolite was very close to the size of phenol and hydrogenperoxide molecule. Besides, as was mentioned in work ofÈapek et al.
33, 60–80% of copper ions are located at the β-
type of sites, represented by a six-membered ring posi-tioned at the intersection of a straight and a sinusoidalchannel with lower level of accessibility to reactants than
other α-type Cu ions.
The molecular size of phenol and hydrogen peroxide
calculated by periodic molecular mechanics optimizationare listed in T able 3

Table 3.  Molecular size of phenol and hydrogen peroxide*
Comparison of the data from in T ables 1 and 3 shows that
phenol and hydrogen peroxide would diffuse more easily inan H-Y5 zeolite pore than in an H-ZSN5 pore.
Another suggestion is that the different activity of the
catalysts was caused by the different acidity of zeolites. Itis well known that redox properties of transition metalcations, e.g. copper species promote generation of activehydroxyl radicals in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Inaddition, it is assumed that the intrinsic acidity of a zeolitecan influence the conversion of hydrogen peroxide, i.e. thehighest formation rate of hydroxyl radicals
35. Therefore,
the better activity of a Cu/Y5 catalyst for phenol oxidationmight have been the outcome of a higher concentration of32 Pol. J. Chem. Tech., Vol. 13, No. 3, 2011
hydroxyl radicals generated over both sites, i.e. Cu2+ and
H+ sites.  Although it is not fully correct to compare the
activity of Cu ions exchanged in different zeolite structures,it is evident that the copper-bearing zeolite with large poresand higher acid strength acted as an effective catalyst forphenol oxidation.
The catalytic results have also shown that under mild
reaction conditions phenol was rapidly removed from theCu/Y5 catalyst with just 75% of stoichiometric oxidantconcentration required for the complete mineralization ofphenol, according to the reaction
C
6H5OH + 14 H2O2 → 17 H2O + 6 CO2 (1)
Which is contrary to other studies reported in literature,
where the oxidant was used in excess15,36.
T able 4 shows  the final values of phenol, TOC and
hydrogen peroxide conversion and efficiency in the use ofan oxidant defined as TOC removal to H
2O2 conversion
ratio after 180 min of phenol degradation for the runsshown in Figs. 3 and 4.
As it can be seen TOC reduction was enhanced by in-
crease of the reaction temperature. But in all the cases itwas significantly lower than phenol conversion which indi-cated that oxidation of phenol proceeded through forma-tion of different intermediates.  The final result was farfrom complete mineralization, namely oxidation to CO
2
and H2O24. The maximum TOC reduction reached 62%
after 3 h in the case of Cu/Y5 when the reaction wasperformed at highest temperature and was close to 34% forCu/ZSM5, which meant that significant amounts of refrac-tory oxygenated intermediates still remained in the liquidphase as the reaction proceeded.
The value of that parameter indicates that hydrogen
peroxide was not effectively utilized to generate reactivehydroxyl radicals that can further attack the organic com-pounds.
It is well known that Fenton-like reactions are based on
the HO. production by catalytic decomposition of hydro-
gen peroxide. They are responsible for fast non-selectivedegradation and mineralisation of the organic matter
37.
The pathway of the reactions occurring in the presence ofhydrogen peroxide can be described as follows:
Cu
2++H2O2↔Cu(OOH)++H+(2)
Cu(OOH)+→Cu++HO2.(3)
Cu++H2O2→Cu2++HO–+HO.(4)
Cu2++HO2.→Cu+ +H++O2 (5)
RH+OH.→H2O+R. → further oxidation (6)
However, hydrogen peroxide can also be decomposed to
other less active radical species as the results of parallelreactions, which inhibit the oxidant power of hydrogenperoxide (reaction (7)).H
2O2+OH.→H2O+HO2 (7)
Generally, HO2.  radicals do not play an important role
in the mineralisation process as they have low reactivitycompared to HO  radicals
15.
It is clear from T able 4 that over the prolonged reaction
times there was a significant decrease in the efficiency of anoxidant for the total oxidation of the organic compound,especially when the catalyst`s activity was higher. That facthad to be attributed to increased concentration of the low-weight carboxylic acids into a liquid phase as the reactionproceeded. These by-products were much less reactive withhydroxyl radicals, which reduced the efficiency of hydrogenperoxide. Low pH values found after 180 min of the reac-tion confirmed the presence of low-molecular-weight car-boxylic acids as intermediates of phenol oxidation as wellas generation of H
+ due to the production of hydroxyl
radicals in the typical Fenton-like reaction scheme (reac-tions (2)–(6)).
The obtained higher catalytic performance of copper-
ion-exchanged Y-type zeolite is supported by its better useof an oxidant. This fact shows that the nature of copperparticles and textural properties of the Y zeolite matrix,seem to be responsible for a more efficient use of theoxidant and the resulting higher degradation rate of TOC.
It is well known that the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation
of phenol is a very complex process, including a set of theparallel and series reactions, and involving many types ofintermediates and final products
20,38,39. They comprise
aromatic compounds, mainly benzoquinone, hydroquinoneand catechol, carboxylic acids (acetic, maleic, oxalic andfumaric acids) and other oxygenated compounds such asaldehydes and ketones.
Fig. 5 show the time-evaluation curves of intermediates
identified when phenol oxidation was carried out over Cu/Y5 and Cu/ZSM5 catalysts. The figure shows that phenolyielded intermediate ring compounds as hydroquinone,catechol, p-benzoquinone and acids such as maleic, acetic,formic and oxalic. Fumaric acid was also identified only intraces. However, some important differences can be pointedout among these two catalysts. First, as already mentioned,the activity of Cu/Y5 catalyst was generally higher than thatof Cu/ZSM5. The concentrations of hydroquinone andcatechol, the most toxic species in the oxidation route ofphenol, become negligible after 3 h, only when the Cu/Y5was used. Secondly, Cu/Y5 catalyzed phenol oxidation morecompletely than Cu/ZSM5. The main carboxylic acids inthe case of Cu/ZSM5 were maleic and acetic acid, and inthe case of Cu/Y5 these were acetic and oxalic acid. Amongthe organic acids, oxalic acid deserved particular attentionbecause it had been reported as the main responsible formetal leaching from Me-based catalysts and  showed refrac-
Table 4.  Effect of temperature on conversion after 180 min of a reactionPol. J. Chem. Tech., Vol. 13, No. 3, 2011 33
tory to oxidation by the CWPO process22,29,40–42. However,
when the reaction was performed on Cu/ZSM5 catalyst(Fig. 4a) the concentration of oxalic acid was very low butthat could not prevent leaching. It can be concluded thatother intermediates of phenol oxidation were also responsi-ble for copper leaching from the zeolite matrix
43. Leaching
could be attributed to catechol because it is well knownthat catechol is also a complexing agent as is oxalic acid
43.
Comparison of the final concentrations of these twocomplexing agents after 180 min of the reaction (Fig. 4)with the percentage of leached-off copper (Fig. 5 A) showsthat oxalic acid is a stronger complexing agent than cat-echol.
Fig. 6 shows the effect of temperature on copper leaching
when the reaction was carried out in the presence or ab-sence of phenol.
After 3 h of the reaction the amount of leached Cu
ranged from 3.9% (Cu/ZSM5) to 7.1% (Cu/Y5) whereasits loss was negligible when the aromatic compound hadnot been added to the aqueous solution. As expected, cop-per leaching increased with the increasing reaction tem-perature and catalyst`s activity. pH was another factor in-fluencing the leach out Cu cations from zeolite structureinto the solution
35,9. The leaching of copper ions was en-
hanced at low pH values36. Since pH of Cu/Y5 suspension
is lower than that of Cu/ZSM5 suspension (T able 3) theamount of leached copper during its use is expected to behigher in the Cu/Y5 sample.
In order to check if small amounts of leached copper
were responsible for catalytic activity, after the first run thecatalyst was filtered, then phenol and H
2O2 were added toFigure 5. Time-evaluation curves of intermediates from

It can be seen that the evaluated phenol conversion in the
filtered solution was lower than in the heterogeneous sys-tem. In the absence of Cu/ZSM5 and Cu/Y5 catalysts (fil-tered solution) phenol conversion after 3 h was 12% and15%, in contrast to the conversion of 95% and 100% in thepresence of Cu/ZSM5 and Cu/Y5 catalysts. These datademonstrated that in the absence of solid catalysts (afterfiltration) catalytic activity was negligible. That meant that34 Pol. J. Chem. Tech., Vol. 13, No. 3, 2011
the fraction of copper leached from the catalysts was not
capable of destroying the organic pollutant.
 Fig. 7 also shows another experiment with soluble cop-
per species (CuSO4) as a copper homogeneous catalyst,
performed to compare its activity with the activity of theheterogeneous catalyst. The initial concentration of copperspecies in the aqueous solution was 3.53 ppm (equivalentto 0.1 g dm
-3 of catalyst with 3.53% (w/w) copper load).
Other reaction conditions were as those in the heterogene-ous test. It can be seen that with equal copper load of thehomogeneous CuSO
4 phenol conversion was inferior to the
activity of the Cu/Y5 sample and superior to the activity ofthe Cu/ZSM5 catalyst. That fact confirmed the efficiency ofthe heterogeneous catalytic system.
Further research was focused on the stability and activity
of the recovered Cu/ZSM5 and Cu/Y5 catalysts. After thefirst run, the catalyst was separated by filtration, washedwith distilled water and dried over night at 378 K. It shouldbe noted that filtration of the solid aimed at determiningthe amount of leached copper, was made in the hot solutionin order to avoid possible problems of copper re-adsorp-tion
40. The catalysts were used in three consecutive experi-
ments under identical conditions. As shown in T able 5, thecatalyst`s activity expressed as XPh and XTOC obtainedfor the reused catalysts was similar to that obtained for thefresh catalyst although complete restoration was notachieved. On the other hand, a remarkable decrease incopper ions leached out to the aqueous solution was re-corded. That indicated that the most unstable copper spe-cies (extra-framework species) leached and were lost dur-ing the first run, whereas leaching was almost negligibleduring further catalyst`s use. That meant that major part ofcopper existed in the framework position of the zeolite ina relatively stable form and was active in phenol oxidationby hydrogen peroxide during consecutive use of the cata-lyst.CONCLUSIONS
The present study reports the results obtained with phe-
nol CWPO using Cu-bearing Y5 and ZSM5 zeolites as thecatalysts.
It has been found that the activity and stability of a
copper-containing catalyst depend on the environment ofcopper species and textural properties of support.
A promising catalyst in the reaction of phenol oxidation
in a diluted aqueous solution with hydrogen peroxide is Cu/Y5 because mild reaction conditions ( T=353 K, atmos-
pheric pressure, initial H
2O2 concentration below stoichio-
metric, and the reaction time of 3 hour) allow completeelimination of phenol and other aromatic compounds withacceptable TOC conversion and without significant leach-ing of copper ions from the zeolite matrix, which maintainsits activity during successive runs.

It can be also concluded that hydrothermal stability of
copper active species within the zeolite matrix is rathergood and significantly higher than that obtained for othercopper-containing catalysts operating under similar reac-tion conditions
27,45.
The results also indicate that the Cu/Y5 catalyst is a
promising catalyst for phenol CWPO because mild reac-tion conditions (T=353 K, atmospheric pressure, initialH
