Abstract  
The effects of superficial gas in the riser (V gr)  and liquid phase properties on the gas hold -up(ɛg) , mixing time 
(Tm) and circulation time (T C) were studied in 8 liter internal air lift loop reactor (down comer -to-riser cross -
sectional area ratio = 0.249). Air was used as a gas phase. Water and four aqueous solutions of 10% 
concentration methanol, ethanol, (were used to simulate the behavior of non -coalescing organic liquids) 50% 
glycerol and 2% Carboxy Methyl Cellulose (CMC) were used to simulate the behavior of co alescing viscous 
liquids. Polyethylene -non-porous -solid particles with a concentration of (50) Kg/m3 were used as solid phase. 
Superficial gas velocity varied from 0.01 m/s to 0.1 m/s and air dispersed into the center of the draught tube by 
using a porous gas distributor. The results showed that (ε g) increased with increasing gas velocity and 
coalescence inhibition of liquid, while T m and T c decrease with increasing gas velocity. It was found that 
increasing liquid viscosity and coalescence reduces (ε g) but  increases (T m) and (T c). The gas holdup was 
correlated with dimensionless groups and independent parameter with correlation coefficient is 0.967, the 
following correlation is obtained.

I. Introduction  
Airlift reactors (ALRs) are suitable for many 
different processes. They are mainly used as 
bioreactors in fermentation processes and in the 
biotransformation of many substances [1, 2]. In 
wastewater treatment ALRs are increasingly being 
developed [3-7]. Airlift loop reactors find extensive 
applications in many areas of chemical engineering, 
especially for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous 
single and multiphase systems due to their simple 
construction and operation, directed circulation flow, 
good mixing and favorable ratio of interfacial area of 
energy dissipation rate per unit volume, low 
investment, operational costs and relatively lower 
power requirements [8]. The mixing time and 
circulation time are important hydrodynamic 
characteristics of airlift re actors [9].The liquid 
circulation velocity effects on the residence time of 
gas, mass transfer and mixing time Tm. Studies 
showed that liquid circulation velocity was affected by 
the gas flow rate and geometric parameters of the 
column.[10-12] Liquid circu lation occurs due to the 
difference in hydrostatic pressure or density between 
the riser and down comer. When gas flow rate 
increases, the liquid velocity also increases, thereby 
entraining most of the bubbles from the riser in to the 
down comer. This will  reduce the difference in hydrostatic pressure (compromising the liquid 
velocity). In general, a higher liquid velocity reduces 
the residence time of the bubbles in the riser and down 
comer, as it encourages the recirculation of gas 
through the down comer and back to the riser. 
(Weiland et al.[13], Chisti et al.  [14], Choi et al.  [15], 
Petrovic and Posarac[16], Bentifraouine et al. [17], and 
Yazdian et al. [18]) investigated the effects of operating 
parameters on the hydrodynamic behavior of 
concentric dr aft-tube type airlift reactors. They 
observed a decrease in the mixing time with the 
decrease of the cross sectional area ratio ( Ad/Ar).  
They also observed the mixing time increases with 
increasing the top and bottom clearances [13, 18].  The 
top and bott om clearances do exert an important effect 
on gas holdup, mixing time, circulation time, and mass 
transfer.  The analysis and description of the behavior 
of an ALR involve the study of characteristics such as 
mixing and circulation time. It is necessary to  get 
information about the interaction between these 
parameters and the operation variable as well as the 
design variables, in order to make a correct design of 
the airlift reactor [19].  Many researchers (Camarasa et 
al., [20]; Kelkar et al., [21]; Posara c et al., [22]) reported 
that the addition of small quantities of aliphatic 
alcohols increased the gas holdup, in comparison to 
pure water, in bubble columns (BCs), continuous BCs, RESEARCH ARTICLE                                                                               OPEN ACCESS  A A Rahman –Al Ezzi  et al Int. Journal of Engineering Research and Applications        www.ijera.com

changes in the gas ho ldup, the induced liquid velocity 
in ALRs is also affected by alcohol addition. Although 
a large number of investigations contributed to the 
knowledge of the effect of various parameters on 
hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics in 
ALRs, available  information frequently showed wide 
variations and conflicting claims. Molina et al. [23] 
characterized mixing in a split cylinder airlift 
bioreactor ( Ad/Ar ratio of 1, sucrose solution with 
viscosity variations of 1.54±19.5×10-3Pa.s, and Vgr of 
0 ± 0.039 m/s). It was reported that viscosity had no 
influence on circulation time, which contradicted the 
theory (increase in viscosity reduces flow as a result of 
resistance). According to them, the driving force of 
circulation has increased with in creasing viscosity for 
any gas flow rate. This was due to the fact that as 
viscosity increased more bubbles were coalesced with 
a magnitude of smaller bubbles, where most of these 
large bubbles were disengaged at the top and smaller 
ones went through the d own comer. This achieved a 
higher driving force for liquid circulation. Viscosity 
had little effect on mixing time, which suggests that 
mixing time was affected by differences in velocities 
between the gas and liquid phases. Merchuk et al. [24] 
carried out  an extensive study in a concentric tube 
reactor with seven different spargers (four cylindrical 
and three porous plates) of varying pore sizes using 
sea water and NaCl. They reported that the sparger 
pore size had an impact on the gas holdup and liquid 
recirculation. The smaller the pore sizes the higher the 
gas holdup which implied a decrease in the liquid 
circulation velocity. At a higher gas velocity, mixing 
time was independent of sparger geometry although 
the geometry of the sparger and pore size had an 
impact at a low gas velocity. Finally, the holdup was 
affected by coalescing and not by the geometry of the 
sparger used. Miron et al. [25] tested mixing in a bubble 
column and airlift (split cylinder and draft tube) with a 
dispersion height of 2 m and working volume of 0.06 
m3 using water and seawater. They reported that, at 
any gas flow rate the values of mixing parameters in 
the two fluid media were identical. In all reactors 
mixing time decreased with increased superficial gas 
velocity. However, the bubble column gave the 
shortest mixing time due to the bulk flow as opposed 
to the airlift where circulation was in a cyclic motion 
impeding the bulk flow. The contradiction is regularly 
attributed to the difference in the reactor geometries, 
experimental conditions and experimental techniques. 
However the present knowledge suggests that this 
contradiction is brought about by some complicated 
phenomena taking place in ALR, such as the bubble 
size distribution, internal liquid circulation, etc. [26-30]. 
The purpose of this study is to clarify experimentally 
the effects of the gas velocity and liquid phase 
properties (coalescing) on gas hold up ( ɛg), mixing time ( Tm) and circulation time ( Tc) in a solid suspends 
concentric tube airlift loop reactor when down c omer -
to-riser cross -sectional area ratio = 0.249 and the air is 
dispersion into the center of the riser by using a porous 
gas distributor.    
 
II. Experimental Section  
A  schematic  diagram  of  the  experimental  
setup  used  in  this  work  is  shown in  Fig ures 1, 1a 
and 1b . A concentric a plexiglass tube airlift reactor  
of an inside  diameter  of 0.9 m and  about a total  
height of 1.3m with draught tube  dimensions inside  
diameter of 0.045m and a total height 0.9 m was used.  
The top and bottom clearances  were maintained 
constant at 5 cm. The volume of the reactor was 8 liter 
and Ad /Ar = 0.249, where the Ad is the downcomer 
superficial area (m2) and Ar is the riser  superficial 
area (m2).  The water level in the reactor was 0.95 m.  
The  draught tube was fitted with three support legs in 
the upper and the lower end of the column so as to 
locate it in a central position at any distance above the 
base.  The  column  consists  of  two  main  sections, 
namely:  the  gas  inlet  section  and  the  liquid 
recycl ing  testing  section.  The  gas  inlet  section 
consists of a gas distributor. At  the  bottom  of  this  
section,  two  lines  are connected  together  before  
entering  the  distributor section  each  line  has  a  
valve  to  be  opened  or closed as re quired. One of 
these lines is the air inlet flow.  Air  compressor  
supplied  the  line  with  the desired amount of air 
needed; in the  experiment, the amount of air was 
measured using a gas meter. The  other  line is  the  
nitrogen  gas  inlet  flow. The  nitrogen was supplied 
from a cylinder.  A  gate  valve  was  used  in  the  
nitrogen  flow, which  must be  shut  off  when the air  
was  sparged to the  column,  and  must  be  opened  
during the desorption process. The liquid  testing  
section  contains   two openings, one for liquid out -
flow and the other for liquid in flow. The  circulation  
of  liquid  in  the  column  was achieved  using  a  
dosing  pump  placed  in  the recycling  line.  The 
column was filled with water to the desired level  
above the distributor (0.95) m. Then the solid particles 
(polyethylene 3.4mm particle diameter and the density 
853.5 Kg/m3) were added to the liquid in the column. 
The concentration of solid particles was (50) kg solid 
/m3slury. The  water  is  fed  to  the  top  of   the  
column  and discharged from the bottom of the 
column using a dosing pump.  Compressed  air  at  
(100-150)psig  was  supplied  using  a  reciprocating 
compressor.The  desired  air  flow  rate  was  set -up  
using gate valve and the amount was measured  with a 
gas meter. The liquid  phase  (batch) consists of the 
following systems (only water, water -ethanol, water -
methanol,water -glycerol and water -CMC)  the 
chemicals used in the present study were procured

Measurements  
The average gas hold up ε g was calculated 
from the equation (1) usingthe data of the clear - liquid 
height (H L) and the height of the aerated liquid (H F) 
which was determined by visual observation:  
o i FL F

 In Eq (1) is a correction term for the volume 
of the draft tube [32] the solid -hold-up was calculated 
from the equation(2).Using the date of static liquid

particles (HF/):

                                                  (2) 
The experimental gas  hold up was found by 
measuring the difference between initial liquid height 
and final liquid height.  Since it was rather difficult to 
read directly the level of the aerated liquid the values 
of gas hold up thus obtained probably involves an 
error of abou t 5%, established via repeated 
measurements.  
 
2.2 Mixing Time Measurement  
Visual monitoring of acid - base reaction 
between HCL and NaOH was chosen among the 
various methods presented in the literature for 
measuring mixing time.  
 
HCl + NaOH             NaCl +  H20 
Methyl red was used as the indicator of the 
above neutralization reaction. Twenty milliliters of 2N 
NaOH with about 30 ml of methyl red indicator were 
added to the liquid which turned deep yellow. When 
the liquid was not deep colored, the further meth yl red 
indicator was added. After setting the operating 
conditions and at time = 0, an amount slightly in 
excess of the stoichiometric quantity of 2N HCl 
solution (about 21 milliliters), placed in a small 
beaker, was added to the surface of the liquid near  the 
wall [33, 34]. The mixing time was taken at the time 
necessary to obtain a complete color change to red. 
This technique is reliable [33, 34]. An average of three 
measurements under the same conditions were taken. 
The technique has been used by a numbe r of workers 
[see for example the most valuable papers of Brennan 
and Lehrer [33] , Hiby [35] and  Mavros, P., [34]. 
 
2.3 Circulation Time Measurement  
The method proposed by ( Lu et al., [36]; Guy 
et al., [37]was used to determine the circulation time. 
The circulation time is the time between two 
successive crossing of tracer particle, in the same 
direction, through a chosen plane. The reference plane was chosen to be the medium - height plane and the 
particle was a colored tracer (black) of foam of about 
5 mm diameter, which becomes totally impregnated 
when immersed in the liquid and thus reaches the 
liquid density. The black tracer particle was clearly 
visible in liquids, an average of five measurements 
under the same conditions were taken.  
 
III. Gas hold up result  
Figures (2), (3) and (4) show the influence of 
gas velocity for different liquid phase systems (water, 
water -ethanol, water -methanol,  water -glycerol and 
water -CMC) on gas hold -up when the  down comer -
to-riser cross -sectional area ratio = 0.249. In general 
the gas hold -up increases with increasing gas through 
put (gas velocity), but interact mutually, depending on 
liquid phase properties. Many Literatures revealed that 
increasing superficial gas velocity i ncreased the gas 
holdup [38, 39, 28, 30].  The variation of a gas holdup in 
the riser (ε g) with superficial gas velocity for air -
alcohol -solid systems are shown in Figure 3. The 
experiments were carried out with constant solids 
(polyethylene 3.4mm particle  diameter and the density 
853.5 Kg/m3) loading of 50Kg/m3and the desired 
liquid height above the distributor (0.75) m.  In the 
presence of alcohols, the bubbles become more rigid 
and hence have low rise velocities resulting in a 
bubbly flow regime up to surprisingly high gas 
velocities (0.1 m/sec). This was mainly due to the 
suppression of bubble coalescence i.e. number of 
small bubbles produced in the riser had an insufficient 
bubble rise velocity to escape from the liquid,for 
aqueous solutions of aliphatic alcohols, a considerable 
increase in the gas hold -up in alcohol chain length was 
observed. The gas hold up decreased i n the following 
order ethanol > methanol.  The decrease in surface 
tension in the presence of alcohols was not sufficient 
to explain this phenomenon. Bubble dynamics and 
bubble swarm structure in the presence of surfactant 
solutions can explain this behavi or qualitatively. A 
similar trend was observed by Koide et al., [40], Nicol 
and Davidson [41] and Al -Masry and Dukkan[42].The 
solid particles retard the bubble rise velocity and 
prevent increases in bubble size.  Figure(4). Shows the 
effect of gas velocity  on gas hold -up using different 
liquid phase (Glycerol and CMC) with solid suspend 
respectively .The viscous solutions of glycerol and 
CMC show only slightly higher gas holdups than 
water. In spite of similar a flow property of the CMC 
and glycerol solutio ns, gas hold -up in the CMC 
solution is somewhat larger, due to accompanying 
coalescence inhibiting. In general, low viscosity liquid 
exhibit bubble disintegration behavior. Whereas, a 
trend towards bubble coalescing behavior has been 
observed with increasi ng the viscosity of the liquid 
media, as shown by many investigators. [43, 44]

3.1 Gas Holdup Correlation  
Dimensional analysis was used to correlate 
gas hold -up with gas velocity and liquid properties. It 
was assumed  that ( ɛg) is a function of the following 
factors: -

It is possible to predict that there must be a 
functional relationship between these variables and 
that the relationship is independent of the units of 
measure. The simplest form for a function is one in 
which the variables are multi plied or divided by one 
another in such a way that dimensionless groups arise. 
From experimental results, it can be seen that ( ɛg) 
increases with increasing (
gV ) and decreases with 
increasing (µ L and
L ), so the resulting correlation 
applied to predict the gas hold -up for air -water system. 
The equation will have the form

IV. Mixing time and circulation time 
results  
It appears that liquid circulation and mixing 
time depends on many interacting (or interrelated) 
parameters, e.g., bubble size, bubble rise velocity and 
gas hold -up in addition to the physical properties of 
1iquid a nd solid as well as solid concentration. The 
mixing process in loop reactors consists of combined 
effects occurring in the draft tube, annular space and 
in the top and bottom deflection zones. Mixing in the 
up and down flow zones is produced by axial 
dispe rsion which mainly results from the difference 
between the velocities of gas and liquid phases. The 
axial mixing fraction of the overall mixing loop

which coalesce in the annular space rise against the 
liquid flow and therefore considerably speed up the 
mixing process. The intensive mixing in the deflection 
zones is caused by differences between velocities in 
the up and down flow zones. In the top zone, mixing is 
intensified by the formation of a rin g vortex above the 
draft tube. Figures (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10) shows 
the effect of gas velocity for different liquid phase 
systems (water, water -ethanol, water -methanol, water -
glycerol and water -CMC) on T m and T Cwhen the down 
comer -to-riser cross -sectional area ratio = 0.249. The 
figures reveal the following:

increases viscosity (water -glycerol system which 
has a viscosity 6 times that of pure water, table 
A2), therefore the T m and T C are larger than that in 
water. This is in agreement with literature (e.g. 
Franz et al [45]).  
(ii) In general the overall effect of presence of 
alcohols [water -methanol, water -ethanol,  figure 
(6)] is that increases the mixing time. These 
systems represents a strongly coalescence 
inhibiting systems this leads to a higher gas hold -
up in the annular space which decreases the 
hydrostatic driving force for liquid circulation, 
therefore the e ffect of gas velocity on liquid 
circulation time is approximately similar to that 
for water figure (9). This is in agreement with the 
literature (e.g. Pandit and Joshi [46]). 
(iii) At high values of gas velocity about 0.1 m/sec the 
Tm and T C for different system s become equal 
because of the liquid velocities approach a 
constant value.

V. Conclusions  
For the present study the following 
conclusions were made: - 
1. The  gas  hold -up  increase  with  increasing  gas  
velocity for Vg ≤ 0.1 m/sec and decrease with 
increasing liquid surface tension in 8 liters  air lift 
loop reactor in the presence of  alcohol and 
suspended solid particles (polyethylene)and the 
down comer -to-riser cross -sectional area ratio = 
0.249.  
2.  The mixing time  and circulation time decreases 
with increasing gas velocity for Vg ≤ 0.l m/sec in 
the air lift loop reacto r when the down comer -to-
riser cross -sectional area ratio = 0.249, and the 
reactor volume equal to 8 liters.  
3. The circulation velocity decreases with increasing 
viscosity and coalescence inhibition of the liquid 
phase.  
4.  Higher viscosities enhance internal friction 
losses, while stronger coalescence inhibition 
results in a higher gas hold -up in the annular 
space which decreases the hydrostatic driving 
force for liquid circulation.
