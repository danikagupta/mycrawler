Abstract  
In the present research, Microwave Assisted Synthesis  (MAS) method was applied to synthesize titania  (TiO 2) at 150  oC in a 
range of  2-6 hours heati ng time. Each prepared TiO 2 were characterized by scanning electron microscopy  (SEM), X -ray 
diffraction  (XRD) and nitrogen gas  (N2) sorption analysis  (Brunaeur -Emmett -Teller  (BET) and Barrett -Joyner -Halenda  (BJH) 
calculation) techniques. The TiO 2 prepared by MAS 150 oC (4 hours) has emerged with the highest photocatalytic activ ity. 
Within 4 hours, the TiO 2 managed to catalyze the degradation of Reactive Golden Y ellow R dye up to 98.51 %. This is  because 
of the TiO 2 possessed  high cryst allinity of anatase phase, small cry stallite size and high pore volume compared to other prepared 
TiO 2.

Introduction  
Recently, heterogeneous photocatalysis has attracted many researchers , whereby this technique was discovered and 
proved to eliminate pollutants, especially organic compounds, in water and air by using solar or artificial light 
radiation [1 -4]. Titania  (TiO 2), one of the hetero geneous photocatalyst has shown  its tremendous ab ility to 
decompose organic compound such as pesticides [5 -7] and dyes [8 -13]. Focus has been given to TiO 2 as it is  non-
toxic, available at low cost, high chemical resistant, low energy consumption and low operation temperature.  The 
basic principle of phot oreaction of organic pollutants with light i llumination catalyzed by TiO 2 can be described as 
follow s: upon illumination of TiO 2 with the light in which contained energy higher than the TiO 2 band gap (3.2 eV 
for anatase), the electrons in valence bands be come excited and jump to the conduction bands, creating electr on-

 hole pairs within the TiO 2. The holes will absorb water to create hydroxyl radicals ( OH). The hydroxyl radicals are 
very reactive and quickly oxidize the organic pollutants into carbon dioxi de, water and some mineral acids [14].  
 
In this study, the TiO 2 powder was prepared and the photocataly tic activity was investigated upon  degradation of 
Reactive Golden Yellow R dye aqueous s olution. Reactive Golden Y ellow R dye is classified as monoazo dy e. The 
greater demand for brilliant hues has increased the demand for reactive dyes worldwide. This dye appears in the 
washwater in its hydrolyzed or unfixed formed at levels that depend upon the degree of fixation on the fabric and 
the type of dyeing proc ess applied, and end up in the dyehouse effluent. However, there is lack of information and 
research regarding to this dye. Normally, the azo reactive dye is resistant to conve ntional biological treatment [15] . 
Therefore, it was considered worthwhile to ma ke systematic  progress to remove Reactive Golden Yellow R from 
the textile wastewater prior discharge.  
 
The TiO 2 was prepared by Microwave Assisted Synthesis (MAS) technique sin ce not much knowledge was expand  
regarding to this technique. Generally, this t echnique is quite fast, simple, and very energy efficient    [16-18]. 
 
Materials and Methods  
Synthesis of Effective TiO 2 Photocatalyst  
The TiO 2 photocatalyst were  synthesized v ia MAS  method. 1 .0 g of commercial TiO 2 powder (SIGMA) was  
suspended in 50  ml of 10 M sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) aqueous solution in a T eflon vessel. This suspension was 
ultrasonicated for 30 min at 40  oC. Then, the mixture was  reacted in a microwave reactor  (Milestone Microwave 
Laboratory Systems) at constant temperature  (150 oC) with va rious heating time ranged from 2 hours to 6 hours. 
After that, each sample wa s washed with 0.1 M acid hydrochloric ( HCl) solution for an hour, followed by distilled 
water until pH value became near ly 7. Then, the washed TiO 2 was filtered and dried at 60  oC overnight. Each dried 
TiO 2 was calcined in furnace at 450  oC for an hour in order to remove impurities as we ll as to crystallize the TiO 2. 
 
Characterization  of the Synthesized TiO 2    
Morphology and elemental composition of commercial and synthesized TiO 2 powder were  examined using 
scanning electron microscope  (SEM, JEOL JSM -6360 LA). An X -ray diffractometer  (XRD, Rigaku  Miniflex II) 
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) wa s applied to characterize the crystalline pha se of the samples. The 
samples we re sp read on a glass slide specimen hold er and the scattered intensity wa s measured between 20o and 80o 
at a scanning rate of 2θ  = 5 o/min. Specific surface area for each prepared TiO 2 photocatalyst wa s measured based 
on Brunauer -Emmett -Teller  (BET) multilayer nitrogen gas sorption method  (Quantachromeautosorb  1C – 
Volumetric Technique) at 77.3 K.  The pore size and pore volume we re estimated using Barrett -Joyner -Halenda 
(BJH) model. The samples we re degassed at 100  oC before sorption experiment.  
 
Photodegradati on of Reactive Golden Yellow R D ye 
In this study, each prepared TiO 2 was tested to catalyze the  degradation of Reactive Golden Yellow R dye within 4 
hours . The photodegradation wa s carried out inside a homemade photoreactor. Mixture of 100 ml of 10 mg/L dy e 
solution and 0.1  g of synthesized TiO 2 powder wa s stirred for 10 min in the dark condition so that an adsorption -
desorption equilibrium could be established between dye and catalyst surface [ 16; 19]. Then, the mixture solution 
was irradiated with UV light (302 nm, 15 watt). During the illu mination, 5 ml sample solution wa s withdrawn from 
the suspension at fixed intervals  (30 min) and filtered to separate the catalyst particles. Each collected sample 
solution wa s analyzed via UV -Vis spectrophotometer  (UV-1601PC, Shimadzu). The  same photocatalytic procedure 
was applied on commercial TiO 2 powder  (SIGMA) for comparison.  
 
Results and Discussion  
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)  
The SEM technique wa s carried out in order to investigate the surface mo rpholog y of the prepared TiO 2 
photocatalysts. Figure 1 showed  the aggrega ted of nearly -spherical shape with reasonably uniform size, distributed 
homogeneously throughout the surface of commercial TiO 2 (SIGMA). The precursor powder, thus, consists of 
typical particulate morphology.

Figure 2 depicted  the micrographs of surface morphology  of TiO 2 prepared by MAS 150  oC with variou s heating

structures. Small packed agglomerates  with various shapes and sizes we re distributed non -homogeneously on the 
large bulky surf ace. When the MAS heatin g time wa s prolong to 4 h ours, many elongated structure we re formed on 
the large bulky surface. However, the small packed agglomerates were still existed. As the heating time was kept  
prolong to 6 hours, the elongated structure continue to grow and distrib uted thoroughly on the bulky surface.

X-ray Diffraction XRD  
XRD wa s applied to determine crystalline phase composition and to estimate crystall ite size of the prepared TiO 2 
photocatalyst. Figure 3 depicted the XRD diffractograms of MAS 150  oC with various MAS heating time. From the 
result, all peaks have been assigned to anatase crystalline phase  (PDF Card No.: 00 -021-1272) when MAS heating 
time wa s less th an 5 hours. However, the TiO 2 with 4 hours treatment showed smoother peaks. This showed  that the 
TiO 2 possess ed high crystallinity. Upon prolong  the MAS heating time to 6 hours, the XRD  pattern of the prepared 
TiO 2 comp rises two type of peaks which we re assigned to sodium titanium oxide  (N2Ti6O13) and anatase  crystalline 
phase. The existence  of N 2Ti6O13 in the lattice structure deteriorated the c rystalline structure of the MAS 6 hours 
prepared TiO 2. Meanwhile, the crystalline sizes we re obtained using Scherrer's equation  in Equation 1 [19 ]:

decreased as the MAS heating time wa s prolong from 2 hours to 6 hours. Table 1 summarized the crystalline phase  
and crystallite size of all prepare d TiO 2.

Textural characteristics of the samples derived from N 2 sorption analysis we re presented in Table 2. The BET total 
surface area  (ABET) and BJH p ore diameter (d) of MAS 4 hours was almost identical with the MAS 2 hours prepared 
TiO 2. However, the A BET of the TiO 2 increased to 139.07 m2/g after treated with MAS 6 hours . Regardless of A BET 
increment, the pore size of MAS  6 hours TiO 2 was almost identi cal with the MAS 2 hours and MAS 4 hours t reated 
TiO 2, which wa s 24.77 nm. The commercial TiO 2 (SIG MA) has a specific surface area of 39.36 m2/g. However this 
data wa s inv alid since its BET constant (C) wa s in negative value. Incorrect incorporation of po ints during BET plot 
due to weak e nergy ads orption of this TiO 2, has contribut e to the negative value of C [20 ]. Meanwhile, the pore 
volume of the prep ared TiO 2 has increased from 0.6670 cm3/g to 0.8254 cm3/g when the treatment time was prolong 
from 2 hours to 4 hours. However, the pore volume was slightly reduced to 0.7935 cm3/g after underwent MAS 6 
hours treatment.  
 
Figure 4 showed the representative N 2 adsorption –desorption i sotherms of the MAS 150  oC prepared TiO 2 with 
vario us heating time. All the TiO 2 show ed the similar type IV isot herms, which represented the  mesoporous  (pores 
2-50 nm in diameter) materials according to the IUPAC classification  [20]. Additionally, the loop observed wa s 
ascribed to type H3 loop, indicating the presence of mesopores with non -uniform or disordered  slit-shaped  pores  
[20]. At the same time, the hysteresis loop approaches P/Po = 1, indicating the presence of macropores  (pores >  50 
nm in diameter) in the photocatalyst  [20]. Overall, the adsorption capacities of all MAS 150  oC prepared TiO 2 were 
much higher than th at of TiO 2 commercial (SIGMA). The results we re summarized in Table 3.

Photodegradation of Reactive Golden Yellow R dye  
The MAS 4 hours prepared TiO 2 contributed to  the highe st catalytic degradation which wa s up to 98.51 % after 240 
minutes irradiat ion. The degradation declined signific antly to 53.83 % for MAS 6 hours treated TiO 2. Meanwhile, 
the MAS 2 hours prepared TiO 2 was insufficient to increase the photocatalytic activity when the percentage of dye 
degradation collapsed to 39.34  % after 240 minutes of UV light irradiation. Commercial TiO 2 (SIGMA) showed 
competitive performance with 91.75  % of dye degradation. The res ults of catalytic performanc es of TiO 2 prepared 
by MAS 150  oC with various heating time we re depicted in Figure 5.

irradiation in the presenc e of MAS 150 oC prepared TiO 2 with various heating time. Performance of 
commercial TiO 2 (SIGMA) was tested for comparison.  
 
 
 
From th e results, t he highest photo catalytic activity of MAS 4 hours prepared TiO 2 was due to small anatase 
crystallite size (13.62 nm), higher crystalline degree  of anatase phase , and hig her pore volume (0.8254 cm3/g) [19] . 
The MAS 6 hours prepared TiO 2 possessed the smallest anatase crystallite size (8 .94 nm) and larger surface area 
(139.07 m2/g), however, its photocatalytic activity was not effectively performed. Indeed, the existence of impurity 
(sodium titanium oxide) (from XRD  result) in the prepared TiO 2 has deteriorated its crystalline structure which led 
to the decreasing of its photocatalytic activity [16]. The performance of MAS 2 hours prepared TiO 2 was even less 
effective because of its larger anatase crystallite size (from XRD result), and lower  pore volume (from BJH result). 
As comparison, the photocatalytic ac tivity of the commercial TiO 2 (SIGMA) wa s lower due to its larger anatase 
crystallite size.

Conclusion  
The Microwave As sisted Synthesis (MAS) technique had produced a potential TiO 2 photocatalyst. The TiO 2 
prepared by MAS 150  oC with 4 hours treatment showed promising performance with almost complete degradation 
of Reactive Golden Yellow R dye  within 4 hours . The h igh performance of the TiO 2 was due to small crystallite 
size, high cryst allinity of anatase phase, and hig h pore volume. The performance wa s higher than the commercial 
TiO 2 (SIGMA).
