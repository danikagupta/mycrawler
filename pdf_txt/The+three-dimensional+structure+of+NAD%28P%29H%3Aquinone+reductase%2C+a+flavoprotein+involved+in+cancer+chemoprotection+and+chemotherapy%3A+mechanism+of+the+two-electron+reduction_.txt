Isoplumbagin (5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) , a naturally occurring quinone from  Lawsonia 
inermis and Plumbago europaea , that has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activity. 
Inflammation has long been implicated in cancer progression. In this study, we examined the anti-cancer 
effect of chemically-synthesized isoplumbagin. Our results revealed that isoplumbagin treatment suppressed cell viability and invasion of highly invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) OC3-IV2 cells, 
glioblastoma U87 cells, non-small cell lung carcinoma H1299 cells, prostate cancer PC3 cells, and cervical cancer Hela cells  by using MTT and Boyden chamber assays. In vivo  studies demonstrate the inhibitory 
effect of 2 mg/kg isoplumbagin on the growth of orthotopic xenograft tumors derived from OSCC cells. Mechanistically, isoplumbagin exerts its cytotoxic effect through acting as a substrate of NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) to generate hydroquinone, which reverses mitochondrial fission phenotype, reduces mitochondrial complex IV activity and thus compromises mitochondrial function. Collectively, this 
work reveals an anti-cancer activity of  isoplumbagin mainly through modulating mitochondrial dynamics and 
function.

 Medicinal plants and their metabolites are great sources for pharmaceutical applications. The 
metabolites in plants provide rich variety of bioactive compounds with anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory or anti-microbial activities. Some of these drugs such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, vincristine, and vinblastine are approved and used extensively  in treating several types of cancer, including breast, 
testicular and bladder cancers [1]. Natural quinones are secondary metabolites of plant  and are categorized as 
benzoquinone, naphthoquinone, phenanthrenequinone, and anthraquinone according to their aromatic carbon skeleton [2]. Quinones are highly electrophilic molecules that accept one- or two-electron from flavoenzymes and iron-sulfur proteins to form semiquinone or hydroquinone. They exert cytotoxic effects through alkylating proteins or DNA, and affect redox cycle with their semiquinone radicals to generate reactive oxygen species. Their cytotoxicity promotes inflammatory reactions, oxidizes DNA, and induces cell death. Quinone-based drugs such as doxorubicin and mitomycin C have been used clinically for cancer chemotherapy, but their adverse side effects and toxicity have been an issue [3]. Consequently, there is a continued search for development of quinone-based agents displaying anti-tumor activity that are less toxic and reduced side effects.  
Isoplumbagin (5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) can be isolated from the bark of Lawsonia 
inermis  [4] and Plumbago europaea  [5] and has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity against 
Carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema [6] and anti-microbial activity against invasive vaginitis strains [5]. Chronic inflammation facilitates the initiation and progression of cancer [7]. Although isoplumbagin is known to exert pharmaceutical effects, no report thus far demonstrates its anti-cancer effect. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate its potential anti-cancer effect and the underlying mechanism.was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

DMSO or isoplumbagin were separately added in the suspension of cells in the upper chamber. After incubation for 24 h, the cells migrated to the bottom side of PET membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Photos of stained cells on the underside of PET membrane were taken using Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Number of cells was counted using Image J. Relative invasion ability was calculated as cell number per area.  2.4 In vivo xenogr aft mice model 
All procedures were performed according to approved National Tsing Hua University Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number: 10602, approval date: 2017/02/17) and National Chiao Tung University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number NCTU-IACUC-108032, approval date: 2019/07/22) protocols. Briefly, in oral orthotopic xenograft CB17/lcr- Prkdc
scid/CrlNarl mice 
model, 1 × 106 OC3-IV2 cells were harvested and re-suspended in 100 μl PBS. The cells were injected 
through the ora l buccal mucosa into six-week-old male CB17/lcr- Prkdcscid/CrlNarl mice (National 
Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan). When the tumor size in oral buccal reached approximately 25 mm3 at 14 
days after inoculation of the OC3-IV2 cells, mice were randomly assigned into two groups: vehicle (DMSO) control group (n = 13) and 2 mg/kg isoplumbagin group (n = 10). Treatments were given via intraperitoneal injection once every 3 days in the morning for 2 weeks. During this period, mice weights and tumor volumes (length × width
2 / 2) were recorded every 3 days. At the end of the study (on day 18), the mice were 
sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation.

To perform molecular docking of NQO1 and isoplumbagin, the crystallographic structure of NQO1 
(PDB code 2F1O) and isoplumbagin (PubChem CID: 375105) was applied. The complex model of NQO1 
and isoplumbagin was performed using PyRx [11]. The structural model representations and docked orientations were generated by PyMOL (DeLano Scientific) and Ligplot [12]. 
 
2.6 NQO1 activity assays  
NQO1 activity assays kit (#ab184867) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). According 
to the manufacturer’s instructions, cells were lysed with 1X extraction buffer containing 1 mM 
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g at 4°C for 20 min. The 
supernatant was collected and then the protein concentration of each sample was determined by bicinchoninic 
acid assays  (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Diluted sample and reaction buffer were added into 96-wells plate 
containing menadione or isoplumbagin with cofactor NADH and water-soluble tetrazolium salt [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] reagent. The absorbance of 
reduced water-soluble tetrazolium salt  was measured at 450 nm wavelengths by a spectrophotometer. 
 2.7 Immunobloting 
Cell lysates of OC3, OC3-IV2, H1299, and 293T cells were lysed by RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 
1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA) containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ng/ml leupeptin and 10 ng/ml aprotinin.

antibody. The immunoblots were detected using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). 
 2.8 Reactive oxygen species assays  
Cells were treated with DMSO or isoplumbagin for 2 h and then and harvested with trypsin. Equal 
numbers of cells ( 5 x 10
5 cells/ml) were incubated with 5 μM of dihydroethidium (DHE; Invitrogen ), a 
cytoplasmic superoxide indicator, for 30 min at room temperature away from light. The intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured by BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Histograms of 20,000 events were analyzed and DHE fluorescence was measured by filter FL-2 (585 nm). The mean fluorescence intensity was calculated by
 BD Accuri C6 Software. 
 
2.9 TUNEL assays 
Cells were treated with DMSO or isoplumbagin for 12 h. After fixed with 1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde 
for 15 min, cells were washed with PBS for two times and added with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 30 min on ice. 
After that, cells were stained by the usage of TUNEL staining kit (Abcam, #ab66108, Cambridge, MA, USA ) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with DNA labeling solution for 60 min at 37°C, followed by addition of PI/RNase A solution for 30 min. TUNEL-labeled cells were evaluated by BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer and the data were analyzed using BD Accuri C6 Software.

After blocking, cells were incubated 
overnight with indicated primary antibodies against TOM20 (a mitochondria marker), and then incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nucleus was stained with DAPI, actin was stained with phalloidin and cells were mounted using Prolong Gold reagent. Images were taken by LSM800 confocal microscopes (Zeiss). 
 
2.11 High-resolution respirometry  
Oxygen consumption rate in intact cells suspension was measured by Oxygraph-2k system (Oroboros 
Instruments). DMSO or isoplumbagin treated cells were detached from the plate by trypsinization and 
suspended at 5 × 10
5 cells/ml in DMEM/KSFM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  into the 
O2k chambers. Oxygen consumption rate of DMSO or isoplumbagin treated cells samples were measured by adding 0.5 
μM oligomycin, 0.5 μM FCCP, 1 μM rotenone and 1 μM antimycin A. For the cell 
permeabilization and measurement of respiration in permeabilized cells, 5 /i2× /i2105 cells suspended in 2 /i2mL 
MiR05 buffer (110 /i2mM D-sucrose, 0.5 /i2mM EGTA, 3.0 /i2mM MgCl 2, 60 mM lactobionic acid, 10 /i2mM 
KH 2PO 4, 20 /i2mM taurine, 20 /i2mM HEPES, 1 /i2g/L bovine serum albumin, pH 7.1) were added in O2k 
chambers. After cells had stabilized at routine respiration, plasma membrane permeabilization was performed by adding 5 
μM digitonin and then O2 consumption rate was measured in response to sequential additions of 
10 mM glutamate and 2 mM malate or 10 mM succinate, followed by 5 /i2mM ADP, 0.5 mM oligomycin, 0.5 
μM FCCP, 1 μM rotenone, 1 μM antimycin A, 0.1 /i2mM TMPD, 0.4 /i2mM ascorbate and 5 mM NaN 3.

Results and discussion 
3.1 Isoplumbagin suppresses proliferation and invasion of cancer cells   
In this study, isoplumbagin was chemically synthesized with 95% purity from AKos GmbH Company 
(Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The effect of isoplumbagin (Fig. 1A) on cell survival among various cancer cell lines 
was evaluated by MTT assays. OC3-IV2, in vivo -selected for highly metastasized OSCC cells [10], U87 
(glioblastoma), H1299 (non-small cell lung carcinoma) and PC3 (prostate cancer) cells  were treated with 0, 1, 
5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μM of isoplumbagin for 48 h. Isoplumbagin treatment inhibited cell survival of 
OC3-IV2, U87, H1299, and PC3 cells with IC50 5.4 μM for OC3-IV2, 2.4 μM for U87, 1.5 μM for H1299, 
and 6 μM for PC3 cells (Fig. 1B-E). We next examined whether isoplumbagin affects cancer cell invasion by 
Boyden chamber assays. As shown in Fig. 1F-J, 5 to 10 μM of isoplumbagin was sufficient to suppress the 
invasion of OC3-IV2, H1299, PC3 and human cervical cancer Hela cells but not U87 cells. These results 
reveal differential sensitivity of these cancer cells to isoplumbagin in terms of survival and invasion. U87 and H1299 cell survival are more sensitive to isoplumbagin, whereas invasion of OC3-IV2 and Hela cells is largely inhibited by isoplumbagin.  3.2 Isoplumbagin inhibits tumor growth in an OSCC xenograft model 
To test the anti-cancer effect of isoplumbagin in vivo , we established orthotopic xenograft model by 
injecting OC3-IV2 cells to oral buccal of CB17/lcr- Prkdc
scid/CrlNarl  mice. When the tumor volume in oral 
buccal reached up to 25 mm3, isoplumbagin was intraperitoneally injected once every three days for 2 weeks.  
The body weight of isoplumbagin- and vehicle-treated  mice was similar (Fig. 2A), indicative of no obvious 
systemic toxicity at this treatment regimen. On the other hand, the average tumor weights for mice treated was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

isoplumbagin were approximately 50% smaller compared to control mice. During the course of 18-day treatment regimen, the average tumor volume in 10 mice treated with 2 mg/kg of isoplumbagin groups was decreased compared to the vehicle-treated  11 mice (Fig. 2D). Due to the difficulty of measuring tumor 
volume in the small oral cavity of mice, the variation of tumor volume is relatively large rendering no statistical difference. Nonetheless, these in vivo  data indicate that 2 mg/kg isoplumbagin inhibits the growth 
of OSCC-derived tumors without systemic toxicity.  3.3 Isoplumbagin is a substrate of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1) 
To identify the candidate targets for isoplumbagin, we used prediction softwares, Swiss Target 
Prediction, Pharmmapper, Polypharmacology Browser and Similarity ensemble approach, followed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DA VID) to investigate of the interaction network (Fig. 3A). The top five functions of isoplumbagin-targeted proteins were related to oxidation-reduction process, signal transduction, response to drug, negative regulation of apoptosis process and protein phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Based on the cluster and the highest enrichment score, NQO1 protein was ultimately chosen for further investigation. Physically, NQO1 enzyme functions as a homodimer [13, 14] that uses the NADH or NADPH as a cofactor to catalyze the reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. To understand how isoplumbagin interacts with NQO1 homodimer, the molecular docking and ligand binding simulation approach was used to examine their probable interaction. Four combination of NQO1 homodimer are shown based on eight chains of crystal structure of NQO1 (PDB code 2F1O). Isoplumbagin bound to the enzymatic active site of NQO1 homodimers through hydrogen bonds with residues Tyr126, Tyr 128, or was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Met154, His161, Phe178, and Phe236 of NQO1 (Fig. 3C). Based on their predicted binding affinity and the distance of hydrogen bonds, we propose the most stable complex is isoplumbagin and B/D chains of NQO1 (Fig. 3D). Compare to the previously reported interaction between NQO1 and its inhibitor dicoumarol, residues Trp105, Tyr126, Tyr128, Gly149, His161 and Phe178 of NQO1 were involved [15]. We next 
investigated whether isoplumbagin is a substrate or an inhibitor of NQO1 using an in vitro  NQO1 activity 
assays. This assay uses menadione as a substrate of NQO1, together with cofactor NADH, and reduces menadione for further reduction of water-soluble tetrazolium salt to yellow color formazan. As shown in Fig. 
3D, formazan was increased in the presence of menadione, compared to no substrate, similar to the effect of isoplumbagin. This result suggests that isoplumbagin is a NQO1 substrate.  
 
3.4 NQO1 levels
 varies in different types of cancer  
NQO1  facilitates detoxification of quinones to stable hydroquinones through two-electron reduction 
process ( Supplementary Fig. 2A ). The two-electron reduction catalysed by NQO1 protects cells from 
oxidative stress thereby avoiding the production of semiquinone radicals. This mechanism has been used in a 
number of cancer cell types, such as lung, pancreatic and breast cancer, for survival [16, 17]. Interesting, w e 
found that NQO1 was increased in OC3 cells and H1299 compared to normal 293T cells, but NQO1 expression was significantly reduced in highly invasive OC3-IV2 cells compared with its parental OC3 cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, analysis of public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets for NQO1 expression in 
patient samples of various cancer types showed different expression profiles in primary tumors compared with their respective normal tissues or metastatic stage; NQO1 expression was decreased in colorectal cancer was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

tongue squamous cell carcinoma, papillary thyroid cancer and metastatic stage of cervical cancer and melanoma (Fig. 4B-C). These results suggest that high or low NQO1 might not be a bonafide prognostic marker. Nonetheless, lower NQO1 expression correlates with advanced prostate cancer, metastatic tissues 
and mesenchymal attributes [18]. Thus, targeting NQO1 should carefully consider the stage/progress of the 
diseases.  
Dicoumarol, an available NQO1 inhibitor, which competes with NAD(P)H for binding to NQO1, had no 
obvious effect on suppression of OSCC growth compared to isoplumbagin (Supplementary Fig. 3A and Fig. 1B). This phenomenon implies that inhibition of NQO1 by dicoumarol is not a useful approach for treatment of highly invasive OSCC, which also suggests that isoplumbagin may serve as a bioactivator/substrate for NQO1 rather than as an inhibitor.  
 
3.5 Isoplumbagin does not increase oxidative stress nor DNA fragmentation in the highly invasive oral cancer 
cells 
What is the molecular mechanism of isoplumbagin-induced NQO1 action on suppression of cancer cell 
growth and invasion? β-lapachone, which is currently under multiple Phase I/II clinical trials, is known to be 
bioactivated by NQO1 in NQO1
high tumors leading to generation of reactive oxygen species [19-21]. 
Elevated oxidative stress is correlated with tumor initiation, metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Hence, we examined whether a decrease in cell viability of OC3-IV2 cells treated with isoplumbagin was due to the NQO1-induced intracellular oxidative stress accumulation. As shown in Fig. 5A, OC3-IV2 cells showed no accumulation of reactive oxygen species with isoplumbagin treatment. Another mechanism by which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

crosslinking leading to DNA damage. We, therefore, assessed the effect of isoplumbagin on DNA damage in OSCC cells by TUNEL assays. Our results also showed no induction of DNA fragmentation by isoplumbagin in OC3-IV2 cells (Fig. 5B). Considering the lower level of NQO1 in OC3-IV2 cells compared to OC3 cells, these data are not surprising. We think isoplumbagin may exert anti-cancer effect in the highly invasive OSCC via a novel mechanism.  3.6 Isoplumbagin regulates mitochondrial morphogenesis and respiration in highly invasive OC3-IV2 cells 
We previously reported that OC3-IV2 cells expressed high level of ROS1 oncogene compared to OC3 
cells [10]. The high level of ROS1 oncoprotein did not increase oxidative stress. Our recent findings revealed that ROS1 localized to the mitochondria and increased mitochondrial fission [22]. We thus investigated whether the effect of isoplumbagin on invasive OSCC is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. First, the effect of isoplumbagin on mitochondrial morphogenesis of OC3-IV2 cells was examined by immunofluorescence staining. In the isoplumbagin-treated OC3-IV2 cells, the mitochondria became elongated (presumably through increasing fusion), compared to the mostly fragmented phenotype in mock-treated cells (Fig. 6). Since mitochondrial fragmentation is often associated with cancer metastasis [23] and stemness [24, 25], isoplumbagin may target regulators of mitochondrial morphogenesis to exert anti-invasiveness and anti-stemness properties. 
We next examined the intact cell oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of DMSO-treated or 
isoplumbagin-treated OC3-IV2 cells by high-resolution respirometry using an Oxygraph-2k to determine whether isoplumbagin influenced mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS).

In addition, inhibiting ATP synthase activity by oligomycin 
was associated with a decrease of ATP generation by 24% in isoplumbagin-treated OC3-IV2 cells. Subsequently, addition of the uncoupler FCCP revealing the maximal capacity of the electron transport system (ETS) inhibited 38% after isoplumbagin treatment, whereas spare respiratory capacity, defined as the difference between basal respiration and FCCP-induced maximal respiration, was reduced 44% by isoplumbagin. Finally, rotenone and antimycin A fully blocked respiration through inhibiting Complexes I and III. These data indicate that isoplumbagin suppresses basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and ATP production. 
To directly examine how isoplumbagin reduced mitochondrial OXPHOS, the individual OXPHOS 
complexes activity following a substrate uncoupler inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol [26] that was performed to permeabilized OC3-IV2 cells with digitonin and measured by high-resolution respirometry. The glutamate/malate-stimulated complex I linked respiration (Fig. 7B, upper panel) and succinate-supported complex II linked respiration (Fig. 7B, bottom panel) were not altered by isoplumbagin treatment, but TMPD/ascorbate-stimulated respiration of complex IV was decreased in isoplumbagin-treated OC3-IV2 cells compared to DMSO-treated cells. Taken together, these data suggest that isoplumbagin reduces mitochondrial OXPHOS through inhibiting complex IV activity. These data are consistent with our findings that the highly invasive OSCC correlated with enhanced mitochondrial fission, biogenesis and cell metabolic plasticity [22].  
 
4. Conclusion  
These findings suggest that isoplumbagin is a potential anti-cancer chemical against human oral 
squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, prostate and cervical cancers. We was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.
