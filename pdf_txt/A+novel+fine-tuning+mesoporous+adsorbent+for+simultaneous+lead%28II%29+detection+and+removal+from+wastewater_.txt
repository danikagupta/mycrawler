The functionalized mesoporous silica based fine -tuning mesoporous  adsorbent  was developed 46 
for ultra -trace lead (Pb(II)) detection and removal from wastewater. The mesoporous adsorbent  47 
was fabricated  by direct  immobiliz ation of 1E,1`E,1``E,1```E(tetrakis(3 -carboxysalicylidene)) 48 
naphthalene –1,2,5,5–tetramine (TSNT)  onto mesoporous silica monoliths. The design of the 49 
ligand into ordered pore -based mesoporous adsorbent transformed the Pb(II) detection and 50 
removal systems into smart and stable assemblies. The ability of the mesoporous adsorbent to 51 
detect and remove Pb(II) from aqueous solutions has been studied and discussed with different 52 
optimized conditions of concentrations, the amount of mesoporous  adsorbent, concentration of 53 
coexisting electrolyte and pH. T he design of such a tunable mesoporous  adsorbent  offered a 54 
simple procedure in such toxic Pb(II) ions removal without using high -tech, sophisticated 55 
instruments. The mesoporous  adsorbent was able to  detect the ultra -trace Pb(II) ions with high 56 
sensitivity and selectivity based on charge transfer ((intense π –π transition) transduction. 57 
Therefore, the mesoporous  adsorbent proved to have an efficient ability for continuous 58 
monitoring of toxic Pb(II) ions even on- site and in situ chemical analyses.  The removal data 59 
revealed that mesopo rous adsorbent  has high sorption capacity (184.32 mg/g) based on 60 
sorption isotherms measurements. The major advantage of the tunable design mesoporous 61 
adsorbent was that the mesoporous adsorbent retained highly efficient sensitive  selectivity 62 
without a sig nificant kinetic hindrance, despite the slight decrease of sorption after several 63 
regeneration/reuse cycles. Uptake of Pb(II) onto mesoporous adsorbent to equilibrium  64 
occurred  quickly and  the mesoporous adsorbent could be regenerated for reuse with dilute d 65 
HCl. Therefore, the mesoporous adsorbent  has been shown to have the potential to be used as 66 
an effective adsorbent  for ultra –trace Pb(II)  ions detection and removal from wastewater.  67

 1. Introduction  70 
Tons of heavy metals are generated annually by industrial activity that has 71 
contaminated water bodies all over the world. Therefore, heavy metal pollution has received 72 
much attention in the media and scientific literature due to the severe toxic effects on human 73 
health and the environment  [1]. However, lead (Pb(II)) is generated from the paints, pigments 74 
and printing industries, petroleum refining industry, use of storage batteries and electrodes in 75 
electrochemis try and chemical industries [ 2–4]. Lead is the second top priority hazardous 76 
substance according to ATSDR [ 5]. Lead is non- biodegradable  and has a tendency to 77 
accumulate in blood, soft tissues and as lead triophosphate in bones. Long -term consumption 78 
of water containing Pb(II) , even in low concentration, can cause many chronic or acute 79 
diseases such as  brain damage, kidney damage, and gastrointestinal distress to humans, as 80 
well as damage to the central nervous center, renal system, convulsions possibly re sulting in 81 
death and mental retardation in children [ 6–8]. Therefore, the maximal permissible limit is set 82 
to 0.015 mg/L (15 ppb) [ 9]. This concentration value is considered as the threshold for the 83 
safeguard of public health and maintenance of an ecologic al equilibrium. Thus, monitoring of 84 
lead from the environment with high sensitivity  and the removal of excess lead ions from 85 
wastewater is important  and essential to safeguard ing the public health and maintaining  water 86 
quality.  87 
Recent attention to the imp act of low level Pb(II) on public health has encouraged a 88 
major research effort to develop effective means to detect and remove toxic Pb(II) from 89 
drinking water and wastewater.  There are several techniques widely -used for Pb(II) detection 90 
such as atomic ab sorption spectrometry (AAS), colorimetric assay, atomic emission 91 
spectrometry (AES), electrochemistry methods, biosensors, nuclear magnet resonance, and 92 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS) [ 10–13 ]. However, most traditional 93 
analytical techniques do not allow direct analysis of Pb(II) especially in complex media and 94 
4 
 their sophisticated instrumentation and/or complicated sample preparation hamper their 95 
application for in- field studies. For this reason, interest in innovative methods to monit or 96 
contaminated water has been increasing  based on simple, robust, easy -to-use and efficient 97 
sensitivity . Therefore, a variety of chemosensors [ 12] have been developed to detect Pb(II) in 98 
wastewater. However, colorimetric methods [ 13] are attractive and ab le to be directly read 99 
with naked- eye observation. The colorimetric methods are quite sensitive, however, these are 100 
not specific for Pb(II) and form color complexes with other metal ions [ 14–16] . Therefore, an 101 
effective method for technological diversity i s the optical mesoporous adsorbent  model  based 102 
on generating the analytical signal as a response to binding with Pb(II) ions.  103 
Several technological methods such as chemical precipitation, coagulation, 104 
complexions, ion exchange, solvent extraction, reverse  osmosis, distillation and adsorption  105 
have been used to remove Pb(II) from wastewater [ 17–23] .  Many of them suffer from 106 
incomplete Pb(II) removal, high reagent and energy requirements and generation of toxic 107 
waste sludge products that require proper disposal and further treatment. In the last few 108 
decades, the adsorption process has received much attention and represents an effective 109 
process for the removal of pollutant contaminants [ 24,25].  Moreover, adsorption of solid 110 
adsorbents is more effective at low concentrations of harmful pollutants removal. However, the 111 
high price of adsorbents increases the cost of treatment methods. Therefore, several research 112 
efforts have been performed in order to develop new sensitive, selective and cost -effective 113 
adsorbents.  114 
Recently, nanaomaterials based nanotechnology is gaining considerable public interest 115 
for ultra -trace toxic metal ions removal due to the high surface -area-to-volume ratio that makes  116 
them  a suitable  and cost -effective treatment method [ 26–28] . So, the pre sent work is aimed at 117 
developing ligand supported mesoporous adsorbent for simultaneous low -level Pb(II) detection 118 
and removal from water. The conventional ligands are slow metal -ion capturing and lack 119 
selectivity toward a particular metal ion. So  the specific and fast complexation of the metal 120 
5 
 ions with ligand immobilized mesoporous adsorbent was investigated for selective removal of 121 
heavy -metal ions from wastewater.  122 
In this study, we developed mesoporous adsorbent by successful immobilization of 123 
synthesi zed 1E,1`E,1``E,1```E (tetrakis(3 -carboxysalicylidene))naphthalene -1,2,5,5- tetramine 124 
(TSNT) ligand ( Scheme 1 ) onto large cage mesostructures silica for the  detection and removal 125 
of Pb(II) ion s. The ligand onto mesoporous silica was associated based on non- covalent 126 
interactions, Van der Waals forces and reversible covalent bonds. Several parameters such as 127 
pH, limit of detection, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and sorption capacity were 128 
systematically  investigated and discussed. This paper is concerned with  operational parameters 129 
for optimum detection and removal of Pb(II) from water by fine tunable mesoporous adsorbent. 130 
A complete laboratory investigation of this process would generally consist of three parts such 131 
as (i) preparation of mesoporous adsorbent, (ii) demonstration the detection operation and 132 
feasibility low detection limit and (iii) optimum removal operation to obtain data to be used in 133 
designing the full -scale plant.  134

2. Materials and methods  136 
2.1. Materials  137 
All materials and chemicals were of analytical grade and used as purchased without 138 
further purification. Tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS) and the triblock copolymers of 139 
poly(ethylene oxide –b–propylene oxide –b–ethylene oxide ) as Pluronic F108, designated as 140 
F108 (EO 141PO 44EO 141) were obtained f rom Sigma –Aldrich Company Ltd. USA. The standard 141 
Pb(II) and other metal ions solutions  were prepared from their corresponding AAS grade (1000 142 
μg/mL) solutions and purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan. For pH 143 
adjustments  in detection operation, buffer solutions of 3–morpholinopropane sulfonic acid 144 
(MOPS) and 2 –(cyclohexylamino)ethane sulfonic acid (CHES) were procured from Dojindo 145 
6 
 Chemicals, Japan, and  KCl, HCl, NaOH from Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan. Ultra -pure 146 
water prepared with a Milli–Q  Elix Advant 3 was used throughout this work. 147 
 148 
2.2. Synthesis and characterization of the TSNT ligand 149 
The preparation of major steps for the 1E,1`E,1``E,1```E (tetrakis(3 - 150 
carboxysalicylidene)) naphthalene- 1,2,5,5- tetramine (TSNT)  are shown in Scheme 1 . The 151 
TSNT was prepared by the reaction of naphthalene- 1,2,5,6- tetraamine (0.25 moles) and 3- 152 
formyl -2-hydroxybenzoic acid (one mole) in ethanol and small amount of acetic acid was 153 
added. The resultant mixture was then heated under reflux for 4 hours and left to cool at room 154 
temperature. The solid formed upon cooling was collected by suction filtration. The separated 155 
product was recrystallized from the system dichloromethane/methanol 1/1 and the purpose 156 
product was dried at 50oC for 24 h. The purity of the TSNT w as analyzed by CHNS elemental 157 
analyses as follows: C, 64.59%; H, 3.56%; N, 7.15% as consistent with the C 42H28N4O12 158 
molecular formula, which requires C, 64.62%; H, 3.59%; N, 7.17%. The product was 159 
characterized by 1H NMR spectroscop y. The 1H NMR (400 MHz i n CDCl 3) data of BSBAE 160 
are as follows: δ  5.35 (4H, Ph- OH), 7.29 (4H, p, Ph- OH), 8.0 (4H, o, Ph- OH), 8.01 (4H, 161 
naphthalene), 8.2 (4H, m, Ph- OH), 8.87 (4H, CH -imine), 11 (4H, carboxylic acid). 13C NMR 162 
(400 MHz, CDCl 3): δ 113.4 (4C, Ph, Ph- COOH), 118.4 (4C, Ph, Ph- CH=N), 121.3 (4CH, Ph, 163 
p-Ph-OH), 133.4 (2C, naphthalene), 134.0 (4CH, Ph, o- Ph-OH), 144.1(4C, naphthalene), 160.0 164 
(CH, imine), 162.6 (4C, Ph, Ph- OH), 171.8 (4C, carboxylic acid), where the Ph is the phenyl.  165 
 166 
2.3. Preparation mesoporous silica and mesoporous adsorbent  167 
The preparation  of me soporous silica monoliths procedure  was involved by adding of 168 
TMOS and triblock copolymers ( F108 (EO 141PO 44EO 141, MW: 14,600) ) to obtain a 169 
homogenized sol–gel mixture  based on the F108 /TMOS mass ratio. The liquid crystal phase 170 
was achieved after quick addi tion of acidified aqueous solution and to promote hydrolysis  of 171 
7 
 the TMOS around the liquid crystal phase assembly of the  triblock copolymer surfactants. 172 
However, the mesoporous silica monoliths  were synthesized following the reported methods 173 
[15,27]. In ty pical conditions, the composition mass ratio of F108:TMOS:HCl/H 2O was 174 
1.4:2: 1 respectively. The homogeneous sol -gel synthesis was achieved by mixing F108/TMOS 175 
in a 200 mL beaker and then shaking at 60°C until homogeneous. The exothermic hydrolysis 176 
and condensation of TMOS occurred rapidly by addition of acidified aqueous solution of HCl 177 
(at pH = 1.3) to this homogeneous solution. The  methanol produced from the TMOS 178 
hydrolysis was removed by a vacuum pump connected to a rotary  evaporator at 45°C. Then  the 179 
materials were dried at 45°C fo r 24 h to complete the drying process. The organic moieties 180 
were removed by calcination at 500 °C for 6 h under the normal atmosphere. After calcinations , 181 
the material  was ground properly and ready to use as substrates for fabri cation adsorbent . 182 
The mesoporous adsorbent  was prepared by direct immobilization of TSNT (60 mg) in 183 
dimethylformamide (DMF) solution into 1.0 g mesoporous silica . The immobilization  184 
procedure was performed under vacuum  at 50°C until TSNT  saturation was ach ieved. The 185 
DMF was removed by a vacuum connected to a rotary evaporator  at 80°C and the resulting 186 
mesoporous adsorbent  was washed  in warm water to check the stability and elution of TSNT 187 
from inorganic silica materials . Finally, the  mesoporous adsorbent wa s dried  at 45°C for 8 h 188 
and ground to fine powder for Pb(II) ions detection and removal  experiments under optimum 189 
conditions . The TSNT  immobilization amount (0.04 mmol/g) was calculated from  the 190 
following equation:  191 
                                     Q  = (Ci – C f) V/m                                                                            (1)  192 
where, Q is the adsorbed amount  (mmol/g) , V is the solution volume (L), m  is the mass of 193 
mesoporous silica  (g), C i and C f are the initial concentration and supern atant concentration of 194 
the TSNT , respectively.  195 
 196 
2.4. Pb(II) ions detection, removal and reuses studies  197 
8 
 In order to  detect  Pb(II), the mesoporous adsorbent  was immersed in  a mixture of 198 
specific Pb(II) ions concentrations  (2.0 mg/L)  and adjusted  at appropria te pH of 2.01, 3.50 ( 0.2 199 
M of KCl  with 2.0 M HCl ), 5.20 (0.2 M CH 3COOHCH 3COONa  with 1.0 M HCl), 7.01 (0.2 M 200 
MOPS  with NaOH) , 9.50 (0.2 M CHES  with  NaOH ) at constant volume ( 10 mL) with 201 
shaking in a temperature -controlled water bath with a mechanical shake r at 25°C for 20 min  at 202 
a constant agitation speed of 110 rpm to achieve good color separation. A blank solution was 203 
also prepared, following the same procedure for  comparison with color formation . After color 204 
optimization, the solid materials were filtere d using Whatman filter  paper (25 mm; S hibata 205 
filter holder) and used for  color assessment and absorbance measurements  by solid -state UV – 206 
Vis–NIR spectrophotometer for the qualitative and quantitative Pb(II) ion estimation. The 207 
mesoporous adsorbent was ground to fine powder to achieve homogeneity in the absorbance 208 
spectra.  The det ection limit ( LD) of Pb(II)  ions using the mesoporous adsorbent was 209 
determined  from the linear part of the calibration plot according to the following equation [ 28]:  210 
LD  = KS b/m                                                                                  (2)  211 
where, K value is 3, S b is the standard deviation for the blank and m  the slope of the  calibration 212 
graph  in the linear range, respectively.   213 
In removal operation, the mesoporous adsorbent  was also  immersed in  Pb(II) ions 214 
concentrations  and adjusted  at specific  pH values by adding of HCl or NaOH in 20 mL 215 
solutions and the amount of mesoporous adsorbent was 10 mg. After stirring for 1 h at room 216 
temperature, the solid materials  were separated by filtration system and Pb(II) concentrations 217 
in before and after sorption operations were analyzed by ICP –AES. During the removal 218 
operation, t he amount of adsorbed Pb(II)  was calculated according to  the following  equations:  219 
Mass balance q e = (C 0  – C f) V/M  (mg/g)                                                           (3)  220 
                                    (C 0 – C f)  221 
and metal ion removal efficiency  Re =                         x 100 (%)                                          ( 4) 222 
                                                                     C 0 223 
 224 
9 
 where, V is the volume of the aqueous solution (L), and M is the weight of the mesoporous 225 
adsorbent (g), C 0 and Cf are the initial and final concentrations of Pb(II) ions in solutions, 226 
respectively.  227 
To determine the kinetics performances, 1 0 mg  of mesoporous adsorbent  was added to 228 
20 mL solution containing 5.0 mg/L concentrations of Pb(II) ions . The  mixture  was then 229 
stirred, and s amples were filtered  at different time intervals and the fil trate solution was 230 
analyzed  by ICP–AES. In the case of maximum removal capacity, 10 mg of mesoporous 231 
adsorbent was also added in different concentration of Pb(II) ions and stirred (650 rpm) for 3 h 232 
and filtrate solutions were analyzed by ICP –AES.   233 
In orde r to evaluate the reusability of the mesoporous adsorbent, elution experiments 234 
were conducted with pertinent concentration monoprotic acid. First, 20 mL of 5.0 mM Pb(II) 235 
ion solution was adsorbed by the 40 mg mesoporous adsorbent and then elution experimen ts 236 
were carried out using 0.20 M HCl acid. The adsorbed Pb(II) ions and adsorbent were washed 237 
with deionized water several times and transferred into 50 mL beaker. To this 5.0 mL of the 238 
eluting agent was added and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. The concentration of Pb(II)  239 
ions released from the adsorbent into aqueous phase was analyzed by ICP –AES. Then the 240 
mesoporous adsorbent was reused in several cycles and clarifies long -term use as cost - 241 
effective adsorbent.  All experiments in this study were duplicated to assure the consistency and 242 
reproducibility of the results.  243 
 244 
2.5. Analyses  245 
The NMR spectra w as obtained on a Varian NMR System 400MHz Wide -Bore 246 
Spectrometer . The N 2 adsorption- desorption isotherms were measured using the 3Flex  247 
analyzer ( Micromeritics, USA ) at 77 K.. Before the N 2 isothermal analysis, silica substrates 248 
were pre- treated at 100 °C for 3 h under vacuum until the pressure was equilibrated to 10–3 Torr. 249 
The pore size distribution was measured from  the adsorption isotherms curve by using 250 
10 
 nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT). The s pecific surface area ( SBET) was measured 251 
by using multi- point adsorption data from the linear segment of the N 2 adsorption isotherms 252 
using Brunauer –Emmett –Teller (BET) theory. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was 253 
obtained by using a JEOL (JEM -2100F ) and operated  at 200 kV. The TEM samples were 254 
prepared by dispersing the powder particles in ethanol solution using an ultrasonic bath and 255 
then dropped on copper grids. The absorbance spectrum of the adsorbent  material was 256 
measured by UV –Vis –NIR spectrophotometer ( Shimadzu, 3700)  and metal  ions concentrations 257 
were determined by ICP –AES  (SII NanoTechnology Inc.) . The ICP–AES  instrument was 258 
calibrated using four standard solutions containing 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0  and 2.0 mg/L (for each 259 
element) and the correlation coefficient of the calibration curve was higher than 0.9999. In 260 
addition, sample solutions having  complicated matrices were not used and no significant  261 
interference of matrices was observed.  262 
 263 
3. Results and d iscussion  264 
3.1. Mesoporous  silica  and mesoporous adsorbent  265 
The large type -H2 hysteresis loops and well -defined steepness of the N 2 isotherms 266 
indicate large with uniform cage structures mesoporous silica ( Fig. 1) that  was fabricated by 267 
using F108 as a soft t emplate. The shift toward higher P /Po for the desorption isotherms 268 
indicates other enlarged pore entrances were connected without loss of cage periodicity in 269 
mesostructures. Therefore, the mesoporous silica  has the appreciable textural parameters of 270 
specif ic surface area ( SBET), mesopore volume ( Vp), and tunable pore diameters. The decrease 271 
in pore size, surface area, and pore volume correspond to the inclusion of TSNT ligand 272 
molecules into mesoporous carriers ( Fig. 1(b)). In addition, the TSNT ligand has become rigid 273 
in inner pore surfaces and the retention of the physical characteristics of the mesoporous 274 
adsorbent could enhance the diffusion kinetics for Pb(II) -TSNT binding events, as evidenced 275 
11 
 by the fast response time with the low -level Pb(II) detection  and removal. Moreover, the 276 
tunable silica surfaces have significant advantages for direct immobilization of TSNT in which 277 
high loading capacity of TSNT  was achieved with open specific activity of the TSNT 278 
functional groups.  279 
The SEM images of as -synthesize d samples prepared by an instant direct -templating 280 
method are shown in Fig. 2(A,B). A large cage with particle size of more than 200 µm has 281 
been fabricated due to the synthesis applying the emulsion as structure directing agent and t he 282 
SEM pictures of the samples are typical for the silicate mesoporous materials and show large 283 
particle morphologies [ 14,16]. This synthesis method was believed to generate the bulk form 284 
of mesoporous silica cage monoliths. A higher magnification SEM image clarified the 285 
presenc e of macropores of various sizes ranging from 1 to 10 µm. The micrographs clearly 286 
revealed that the resulting particles were almost perfectly spherical in shape and size. The 287 
TEM images show  (Fig. 2(C,D)  highly ordered mesoporous structure, in which the pores were 288 
well arranged as mesocage structures , which indicated the direct  interaction between TSNT 289 
ligand and silica into the rigid condensed pore surfaces with retention of  the ordered structures, 290 
leading to high flux and efficient Pb(II) ion transport  during the capturing system . The highly  291 
ordered porous structure of mesocage silica  with average pore size is about 7.5 nm. In the 292 
preparation of the mesoporous adsorbent, the hydrogen bonding  or hetero atoms bonding  293 
occurred between the abundant  hydroxyl gr oups of pore surface silicates and the heteroatoms  294 
of the synthesized TSNT ligand molecule .  295 
 296 
3.2. Pb(II) detection parameters  297 
3.2.1. Effect of solution  pH 298 
In naked -eye Pb(II) detection , the effect of solution pH is depended on achieving  the 299 
optimum  color formation and sensitive  detection . The optimum color formation and signaling  300 
response are possible based on the stable complexation and binding ability of Pb(II) –TSNT . 301

 Therefore, a wide pH range from 2.0 to 9.5 using different buffer solutions in each pH r egion 302 
was investigated for Pb (II) ions detection and the absorbance spectra were carefully evaluated . 303 
The amount of mesoporous adsorbent dose was sufficient to achieve good color separation 304 
between the ‘‘blank’’ and Pb (II) ion –ligand ‘‘sample,’’ at ultra -trace Pb(II) ion  concentration. 305 
The n otable changes in color and absorbance intensity of the mesoporous adsorbent for Pb(II) 306 
was observed at pH 7.0 as shown in Fig. 3. The specific color intensity of [Pb(II)–TSNT ]n+ 307 
binding events on the mesoporous adsorben t at a specific pH region indicated the 308 
thermodynamic stability of the geometrical coordination.   309 
 310 
3.2.2. Simple recognition and detection limit  311 
The sensitive Pb(II) -spectral response of the mesoporous adsorbent ensured excellent 312 
optical Pb(II) isolations even at ultra- trace concentrations with significant color transitions as 313 
illustrated in Fig. 4(A) . The tunable mesoporous adsorbent showed phenomenal behavior in 314 
terms of sensitivity by forming stable chelate complexes with Pb(II) ions as [Pb(II) –TSNT ]n+. 315 
The quantification process for Pb(II) detection by the mesoporous adsorbent over μ g/L to 316 
mg/L level concentrations was monitored via UV/Vis spectroscopy. Increasing in Pb(II) 317 
concentration from 0 to 2.0 m g/L, increases in  the absorbance  spectra correspond to color 318 
formation between mesoporous adsorbent and Pb(II) ions at pH 7.0. The ab sorbance spectra of 319 
the mesoporous adsorbent exhibited a shift from ( λmax) 375 nm to 350 nm, resulting from the 320 
binding of Pb(II) ions with the TSNT ligand ( Fig. 4(A) ). It is also noted that the shift from 510 321 
nm to 455 nm was not consistent and the consis tent shift was found from 375 nm to 350 nm 322 
with increasing the Pb(II) ions concentration based on the signal intensity measurement as 323 
judged from Fig. 4(A) . Therefore , the signaling responses indicated the formation of charge - 324 
transfer [Pb(II) −TSNT]n+ compl exes and stable complexation at pH 7.0. The  naked -eye 325 
observation of  rapid  and sensitive detection of Pb(II) at ultra -trace concentrations by using 326 
such a mesoporous adsorbent  indicated the high performance and reliability of this detection 327 
13 
 system.  The mesoporous adsorbent led to simple separation and visual detection over a wide 328 
range of concentrations, as well as the sensitive quantification of analyte ions at trace levels. 329 
The results also evidence that the color change provided a simple procedure for se nsitive Pb(II) 330 
detection without using of sophisticated instruments [ 15,27] . 331 
Fig. 4(B)  shows the calibration plot of the TSNT -modified mesoporous adsorbent 332 
during Pb(II) detection. The quantification measurements were performed using a wide range 333 
of concen trations (up to 2.0 mg/L) from Pb(II) ions under optimum detection conditions. The 334 
linear correlation at low concentration ranges indicated that the Pb(II) ions can be detected 335 
with high sensitivity over a wide range of concentrations ( 0.024 to 0.483 µM) . Moreover, a 336 
nonlinear correlation at the inflection point was evident to the highest Pb(II) ion concentration 337 
(over 0.483 µM), indicating that mesoporous adsorbent is efficient at low -level concentrations 338 
of Pb(II) ions. The standard deviation of the Pb (II) ion analysis was 1.5% as evidenced by the 339 
fitting plot of the calibration ( Fig. 4(B) , inset). The capability of the detection assays is highly 340 
sensitive to detect ultra -trace Pb(II) ions. T he limit of detection ( LD) of Pb (II) ions using the  341 
mesoporous adsorbent  was 0.11 μ g/L. This finding indicates that the tunable mesoporous 342 
adsorbent can effectively separate the Pb(II) ions at trace concentrations.  343 
 344 
3.2.3. Ion selectivity of the mesoporous adsorbent  345 
The specific ions selectivity is a key consideration i n Pb(II) detection by ligand 346 
immobilized tunable mesoporous adsorbent. Therefore, the proposed mesoporous adsorbent 347 
was evaluated under optimum conditions using other environmental relevant metal ions  such 348 
as Co(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Na(I), Fe(II), Al(III), Hg(II) and Fe(III). For 349 
comparison, the concentrations of Pb(II) (2.0 mg/L) and other metal ions are kept identical (30 350 
mg/L), and the changes in the absorbance with the addition of each metal ion were evaluated. 351 
Fig. 5 show s the color pr ofiles and absorbance spectra of the blank  sample and  after the 352 
addition of cations and anions. Experimental results indicated that added metal ions with 353 
14 
 concentrations up to 2.0 mg/L could not induce the significant changes in the absorbance 354 
spectra of me soporous adsorbent except Pb(II) ions. This is due to the  orientation and 355 
arrangement of the TSNT assemblies  mounted onto mesoporous silica with open- pore arrays 356 
and high surface areas which allowed  stable thermodynamic binding of [ Pb(II)-TSNT]n+. 357 
However,  with the addition of high doses of these actively interfered metal ions to Pb(II) ions 358 
detection  system, a high disturbance (±10%) in the quantitative Pb(II) ions detection  data was 359 
summarized in Table 1. Despite the minimal increase in the reflectance sp ectra of the 360 
adsorbent, with the addition of Co(II) and Cu(II) as disturbance species there were slight 361 
changes in both the color map and signal intensity when its concentrations in solution 362 
exceeded 20 mg/L. However, after addition of masking agent (0.10 M sodium thiosulfate), 363 
Co(II) and Cu(II) interferences were eliminated in Pb(II) ions detection system [ 11]. The 364 
results clarified that mesoporous adsorbent is highly selective to Pb(II) ions even in the 365 
presence of numerous environmentally relevant metal ions. 366 
 367 
3.3. Pb (II) ions removal parameters  368 
3.3.1. Effect of pH  369 
The pH of the aqueous solution is the most critical parameter for metal sorption as it 370 
influences both the mesoporous surface chemistry as well as the solution chemistry of soluble 371 
metal ions. Therefore, the effect of pH on Pb(II) sorption onto the mesoporous adsorbent, the 372 
batch sorption equilibrium  was studied  at different pHs in the range of 2.0–9.5. The Pb(II) 373 
removal onto the mesoporous adsorbent was pH dependent as shown in Fig. 6(A) . The results 374 
clarified that Pb(II) removal by the mesoporous adsorbent was very low in the acidic pH 375 
region, but increased rapidly with increasing pH and then reached the maximum at pH 7.0. The 376 
lower Pb(II) removal at low solution pH values may be attributed to the competitive sorption 377 
effect of the H+ ions. One of the reasons for metal ions sorption is that the inert organic matter 378 
mesoporous surface contains a large number of active sites [ 14,15]. The Pb(II) removal 379 
15 
 depends on the nature of the active sites of  mesoporous adsorbent and of the Pb(II) ions in 380 
solution. The refore the maximum removal efficiency depends on the type of inert organic 381 
matter as well as on the type of metal ions for a given inert organic matter at the specific pH 382 
region. The other experi mental parameters for Pb(II) removal parameters were carried out at 383 
pH 7.0 region in this study.   384 
 385 
3.3.2. Effect of contact time  386 
The time -dependent behavior of Pb(II) removal was measured by varying the 387 
equilibrium time between the adsorbate and mesoporous  adsorbent in the range of 10–80 min. 388 
The Pb(II) concentration was kept as 5.0 mg/L while the amount of mesoporous adsorbent  389 
was 10 mg. The removal efficiency is shown in Fig. 6(B)  as a function of contact time. The 390 
data confirmed that the Pb(II) removal  versus time curve was single, smooth and continuous 391 
leading to saturation, suggesting the possible monolayer coverage of Pb(II) ions on the surface 392 
of the  mesoporous adsorbent. The mesoporous adsorbent shows a sorption increase with 393 
increasing time and ex hibited a rapid removal during the short contact time, followed by a 394 
slow increase until equilibrium was reached. This two steps removal was previously reported 395 
by several adsorbents [ 3,8,18]. The rapid step is quantitatively predominant and probably due 396 
to the abundant availability of active sites on the mesoporous adsorbent surface. The second 397 
step is slow and quantitatively insignificant with gradual occupancy of the pore surface active 398 
functional sites. The fast removal could be attributed to the external and internal surface 399 
adsorption. The data also indicated that the equilibrium between the Pb(II) and mesoporous 400 
adsorbent was attained within 40 min. Then a shaking time of 3 h was assumed to be suitable 401 
for subsequent removal experiments in this work f or measuring the maximum sorption 402 
capacity by the mesoporous adsorbent.  403 
 404 
3.3.4. Effect of competing ions in Pb(II) removal  405 
16 
 There are several  cations co- exist ing such as K(I), Ag(I), Na(I), Ni(II), Ca(II), Zn(II), 406 
Ba(II), Co(II), Mg(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Mn( II), Fe(II), Cr(III), Al(III), Hg(II) and Fe(III) in 407 
water with Pb(II) ions. Therefore  the selectivity approach for Pb(II) ions was evaluated by 408 
investigating the metal removal efficiency for the system to ten  other  common metal ions 409 
including K(I), Na(I), Ag(I), Ca(II), Zn(II) Ni(II), Hg(II), Ba(II), Mg(II), and Cr(III) ions. The 410 
initial solution was prepared with 10 mg/L in each of above mentioned ten metal ions in one 411 
beaker (50 mL) and Pb(II) ions in 1.0 mg/L in a 20 mL solution at pH 7.0. Then 10 mg of  412 
mesoporous adsorbent  was added and stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the filtrate solution was 413 
checked by ICP –AES. The Pb(II)  ion was adsorbed via changing the color . A significant 414 
selectivity for Pb(II) ions was observed at a 10- fold excess of other met al ions as shown in Fig. 415 
7. The data also suggested that the proposed mesoporous adsorbent could be applied for the 416 
sensitive analysis and removal of low -level Pb(II) in environmental matrices.  417 
 418 
3.3.3. Sorption isotherms  419 
The sorption isotherm is described by the sorption equilibrium in the degree of 420 
interaction between the amounts of adsorbate on the adsorbents. However, the Langmuir 421 
sorption isotherm describes  the relationship between the amount adsorbed by a unit adsorbent 422 
weight and the amount of solute remaining in the solution at equilibrium assuming that the 423 
presences of a finite number of binding sites are homogeneously distributed over the adsorbent 424 
surface and presenting the same affinity for sorption of monolayer coverage. Then the 425 
Langmuir equatio n has been successfully applied  to this sorption operation as follows : 426 
 427 
Ce/qe   =  1/(KLqm)  +  (1/qm)Ce    (linear form)                              ( 5) 428 
 429 
where,  qm is the maximum sorption capacity, K L is the Langmuir sorption equilibrium constant;  430 
Ce and qe are the concentration of the adsorbate in the equilibrated solution and the amount of 431 
17 
 adsorbed on mesoporous adsorbent , respectively. The q m and KL are the Langmuir constants 432 
which are related to the sorption capacity and energy of sorption, respective ly, and can be 433 
calculated from the intercept and slope of the linear plot, with C e/qe versus Ce as shown in Fig. 434 
8(A) (inset). However, t he linear fits to experimental data were obtained by the Langmuir 435 
isotherms equation. The linear plot of C e/qe versus Ce shows that the sorption obeys the 436 
Langmuir model by mesoporous adsorbent. The maximum sorption capacity is corresponding 437 
to complete single layer  and showed a mass capacity of 184.32 mg/g. The high sorption 438 
capacity obtained by mesoporous adsorbent because mesoporous adsorbent has spherical 439 
nanosized cavities leading to high flux and Pb(II) ion uptake . The essential characteristics in 440 
the Langmuir isotherm model are embodied in a separation factor which is dimensionless 441 
equilibrium parameter R L described as follows:  442 
                                              R L = 1/ (1 + K LC0)                                                                (6)  443 
where, C0 (mg/L) is the highest initial ions concentration. Accordingly, observing R L value to 444 
be positive and l ying between 0 and 1. The R L value is less than 1, confirm the favorability of 445 
the sorption isotherm. The main criterion of the nature of an isotherm involved is as follows: R 446 
> 1, unfavorable; R=1, linear; 0 < R < 1, favorable and R = 0, irreversible isot herm. The RL 447 
value for Pb(II) of mesoporous adsorbent was 0.061 indicating the sorption process was 448 
favorable. The obtained sorption capacities of the adsorbents are comparable to other 449 
adsorbents from the literature and are given in Table 2 . The compariso n data shows that the 450 
mesoporous adsorbent outperforms significantly many other sorbents and was verified  as 451 
promising for the Pb(II) removal from contaminated water streams.  452 
 453 
3.3.5. Elution and reuses studies   454 
The elution and regeneration of the mesoporous adsorbent are likely to be a key factor 455 
in improving process economics and cost effective materials. To evaluate an exact eluent for 456 
regeneration and reusability of mesoporous adsorbent, we performed the elution experiments 457 
18 
 using different eluents. Howev er, Pb(II) elution from the Pb(II) -mesoporous adsorbent beads 458 
was also performed in a batch experimental approach. The reusability was checked by 459 
following the sorption–elution–regeneration processes for eight cycles and sorption efficiency 460 
in each cycle w as measured. Various factors are involved in determining Pb(II) elution rates to 461 
the extent of hydration of Pb(II) ions and microstructure cage cavities of the mesoporous 462 
adsorbent. However, using HCl as an eluent, the coordination spheres of complexed Pb( II) ions 463 
is disrupted and subsequently Pb(II) ions are released from the mesoporous adsorbent surface 464 
into the elution medium. In this study, 20 mg of mesoporous adsorbent was mixed in 30 mL of 465 
200 mg/L Pb(II) for sorption operation and 5 mL of 0.30 M HCl was used as an eluent. The 466 
elution time was found to be 10 min. The possible complexation bonding mechanism and 467 
elution of Pb(II) is shown in Scheme 2 . Fig. 8(B) shows the relationship between the time for 468 
reuses and the sorption capacity of the mesoporous  adsorbent  for Pb(II) ions. It can be seen 469 
that the sorption capacity of the mesoporous adsorbent  decreased slightly after eight cycles . 470 
The mesoporous adsorbent  exhibited high meso–structural stability, active function al sites,  and 471 
high surface area with large pore volume  which imply the potential for several reuses of the 472 
adsorbent . This means that the newly fine-tuned  mesoporous adsorbent has a great potential for 473 
industrial Pb(II) removal applications. 474 
 475 
4. Conclusions  476 
To detect and remove low level toxi c metal at the nanoscale level  will lead to new 477 
frontiers in nanotechnology and materials science, and tunable and sensitive materials are 478 
essential. Therefore  the mesostructured designed mesoporous adsorbent in this study exhibited 479 
interesting selective b ehavior that permits accurate, specific detection and removal of Pb(II) 480 
ions with high efficiency.  The design of tunable mesoporous adsorbent was prepared based on 481 
1E,1`E,1``E,1```E (tetrakis(3 -carboxysalicylidene))naphthalene -1,2,5,5 -tetramine (TSNT)  482 
19 
 ligand onto mesoporous silica monoliths by the direct immobilization method. A batch 483 
detection and removal study has been reported on the sorption of water soluble Pb(II) on 484 
mesoporous adsorbent. The newly prepared mesoporous adsorbent enabled the detection  and 485 
removal responses according to Pb(II) –TSNT binding events by stable complexation 486 
mechanism based on charge transfer ((intense π –π transition)  transduction. The presence of 487 
coexisting ions did not affect Pb(II) ions detection  and sorption systems and me soporous 488 
adsorbent efficiently removed the Pb(II) ion from multi ion mixture solutions. The Langmuir 489 
isotherm was satisfactorily employed to explain Pb(II) sorption at pH 7.0. The detection limit 490 
and maximum sorption capacity of the mesoporous adsorbent for Pb(II) at optimum conditions 491 
were 0.11 µg/L and 184.32 mg/g, respectively. The reducibility and reversibility of the 492 
chemical mesoporous adsorbent remain s a unique and interesting challenge, as the 493 
mesostructured adsorbent can extend the control of Pb(II ) ions detection and removal even 494 
after several regeneration cycles of the elution process. The  reversibility , reusability  with 495 
adsorption capacity and stability  of the  mesoporous adsorbent  implied the high cost- 496 
effectiveness for Pb(II) removal from water . The present work show ed the potential  of 497 
mesoporous adsorbent  to remove heavy metal ions as well  as to separate one from  another for 498 
possible removal in wastewater purification.   499
