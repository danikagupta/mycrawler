Chemical contamination of water from a wide range of toxic compounds, in particular aromatic molecules, is a serio -
us environmental problem owing to their potential human toxicity. In this study, activated clinoptilolite from Manisa-
Gördes region (AMGC) was investigated for removal of phenol and chlorophenols (i.e.  o-chlorophenol, m-chlorophenol and 
p-chlorophenol). AMGC was characterized by FT-IR, TG/DTA, BET Surface Area, SEM, XRD, and XRF methods. Adsorption 
rates of phenol and chlorophenols were very high, and equilibrium was achieved in about 45 min. The maximum adsorptions 
of phenol and chlorophenols onto the AMGC were 7.977 mg/g for phenol, 9.846 mg/g for o-chlorophenol, 9.981 mg/g for 
m-chlorophenol, and 8.241 mg/g for p-chlorophenol. The effect of various parameters like adsorbent dose, pH and initial 
concentration were studied for their optimization. The adsorption values of phenol and chlorophenols decreased with incre -
asing pH. Desorption of phenol and chlorophenols was achieved using ethanol solution (30%, v/v). The rate of adsorption of 
phenol and chlorophenols were found to be maximum at pH 6.25. Equilibrium adsorption data for phenol and chlorophenols 
were analyzed by using Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms. It was found that Freundlich adsorption isotherm is 
the most suitable model.

INTRODUCTION
In the beginning of the 21st century, the mankind 
had to face an important threat of water 
shortage. According to World Health Organization 
(WHO), the shortage of water due to political, 
economical and climatological reasons affects 
more than 40% of the world population [1]. 
Phenolic compounds are very toxic, and 
most of them are known as potential carcinogens. 
Large-scale coal gasification and carbonization 
plants generate huge quantities of waste water 
with high phenolic content [2-6]. They cause 
adverse effects on digestive, nervous and 
respiratory systems, lead to cancer and disrupt 
the thyroid functions according to the report of 
International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS) 
[7,8]. It became necessary to find an effective 
method to remove these compounds from waste 
or polluted waters.  Monochlorophenols (MCPs) 
appeared to be effective cancer promoters 
and they are listed as priority pollutants by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
[9]. US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
regulations call for lowering the phenol content 
in the waste waters to less than 1 µg/L from the 
several thousand µg/L often present [10,11].
The conventional pollutant removal 
technologies include biological, thermal and 
physico-chemical treatments. Biological 
treatments usually require a long residence 
time for microorganisms to degrade the 
pollutant, because they are affected by toxicity 
of chlorophenols (CPs) [12]. Various methods 
have been proposed for the removal of phenolic 
compounds. These methods are based on 
chemical–biological oxidation and solvent 
extraction. The main limitation of these methods 
is their low efficiency in the removal of trace levels 
of phenols. Adsorption technology is currently 
being used extensively for the removal of phenols 
in a low concentration such as ppm level [13]. 
Non-specific sorbents, such as activated carbon, 
metal oxides, silica and ion-exchange resins have 
been employed for this purpose [14]. However, 
recently, specific sorbents have been found to be 
very promising [13]. Specific sorbents consist of a 
ligand (e.g. ion-exchange material) that interacts 
with the organic and inorganic pollutants specifically, and a carrier matrix that may be an 
inorganic material (e.g. aluminium oxide, silica or 
glass) or polymer microbeads (e.g. polystyrene, 
starch, chitosan, cellulose, poly(maleic anhydride) 
or polymethylmethacrylate) [10,15,16].
In recent years usage of low cost adsorbents 
in the removal of aromatic compounds  [17-22] 
especially phenols [5,6], chlorophenols [5,10,17, 
23] and other substituted phenols [16] have been 
widely investigated [5,6,10,13, 6-19,21,23-25]. 
Zeolites have appeared as attractive options 
for removal of organic compounds from the 
wastewater, because of their superior advantages 
[26]. Zeolites consist of more than 40 natural 
species. The most abundant and frequently 
studied zeolite is clinoptilolite. Clinoptilolite has 
been shown to have high selectivity for certain 
pollutants. The characteristics and applications 
of zeolites have been reviewed by Breck [27]. 
Natural zeolites have valuable properties such as 
ion exchange ability and high surface area. There 
are large deposits of natural zeolites in Greece, 
UK, Italy, Mexico, Iran, and Jordan [6]. Turkey has 
approximately 50 billion tons of zeolite deposits  
mainly present as clinoptilolite ores. There are 
large reserves of clinoptilolite  in Bigadiç, Balıkesir, 
and Manisa-Gördes regions [28]. According to 
the General Directorate of Mineral Research and 
Exploration of Turkey, the reserves of clinoptilolite 
in the Manisa-Gördes region are estimated to be 
2 billion tones [29]. High ion-exchange capacity 
and relatively high specific surface areas, and 
more importantly their relatively cheap prices, 
make zeolites attractive adsorbents. Their price 
is about US$ 0.03–0.12/kg, depending on the 
quality of the mineral [30-31]. 
Kuleyin has studied the adsorption 
characteristics of phenol and 4-chlorophenol 
(4-CP) by surfactant-modified zeolite [17]. Su 
et al. [32] studied the adsorption behaviors of 
phenol in aqueous solution on zeolite-templated 
porous carbons with different pore structures 
and surface properties. The adsorption of o-, m- 
and p-nitrophenols on clinoptilolite type natural 
zeolite has been studied as a function of the 
solution concentration and temperature [33]
This study deals with the removal of phenols 237
 S. Uçar et al. / Hacettepe J. Biol. & Chem., 2015, 43 (3), 235-249
and chlorophenols from the aqueous media in a 
batch system by the use of activated clinoptilolite. 
Another aim of this paper is to investigate 
thermal, structural and spectral properties of 
natural clinoptilolite and its H-form samples. 
Therefore, the equilibrium time of the adsorption 
of phenol and chlorophenols, the effect of the 
initial concentration upon the adsorption rate, 
the effect of the pH and the possibility of its 
regeneration have been examined.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials 
Natural zeolitic tuffs from Manisa-Gördes region 
(NMGC), western Anatolia, Turkey used in this 
study. 
Reagents
Phenol, chlorophenols, 4-aminoantipirin (4-AAP), 
potassium ferricyanide K3[Fe(CN)6], hydrochloric 
acid (HCI) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were 
purchased from Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany) 
and were used without further purification. The 
water used in the preparation of the solutions was 
distilled and deionized by an ELGA Option S7BP 
water purification system. 
ANALYTICAL METHODS
Activation of Clinoptilolite
AMGC was crushed and sieved to obtain < 63 µm 
fractions. First, clinoptilolite rich samples boiled 
in deionized water (100 mL deionized water for 
5 g of clinoptilolite) at 60°C for 2 h in order to 
remove the soluble salts. In the second stage, 
the washed zeolite was activated by 100 mL of 
0.2 M HCl solution and rewashed with de-ionized 
water. Third, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ionic forms of 
clinoptilolites were prepared by the batch method, using 1 M solutions at 80°C for 4 h. Finally, the 
treated samples were rinsed with de-ionized 
water and dried at room temperature. Before the 
experimental procedure, all samples were dried in 
an oven at 110°C for 16 h and stored in desiccators. 
After activation, the sorbents were placed 
in acid solutions, thoroughly washed by distilled 
water up to pH about 5.5–6.0 and dried in air. 
The samples of natural zeolite do not possess 
microporous structure but they are observed to 
form hydrogen forms of clinoptilolite [34].
Chemical composition of natural zeolite is 
given in Table 1. AMGC sample has high calcium 
and potassium and low magnesium and sodium 
contents. Ming and Dixon have reported that 
the main cations were Na+, K+ and Ca2+ [35]. In 
addition, iron is present. Iron has been associated 
with impurities present in zeolitic tuffs such as 
iron oxides. The sorbent has a high SiO2 content 
with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 6.75.
The experimental values of cation exchange 
capacity (CEC) were measured according to ASTM 
837C Standard. The total CEC of zeolite was found 
to be 27.174 meq/ 100 g.
N2 adsorption and surface area (BET)
The total surface areas for the NMGC and AMGC 
(H-clinoptilolite) samples were 28.22 m2/g and 
80.51 m2/g, respectively. The total surface area 
of AMGC was higher than NMGC [36]. The natural 
adsorbent has a small specific surface area which 
increases significantly after the activation [34].
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
XRD measurements were taken by Rigaku 
D-max 2200 model diffractometer. XRD analysis 
was performed on the natural and activated Table 1.  EDXRF results of AMGC.

clinoptilolite sample to confirm the crystal 
structure and identity. 
Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermal analysis of clinoptilolite was conducted 
with a Shimadzu TGA/DSC 60H at a heating rate 
of 20 K/min under nitrogen (99.99% purity) with 
aluminum pans at temperatures from ambient 
25°C to 900°C. The powdered sample, about 40 
mg in weight was packeted into the aluminum pan, 
and the gas flow rate was kept at 5 L h-1.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX 
(Energy-dispersive X-ray ) 
The surface morphology and internal structure of 
the AMGC was observed by a scanning electron 
microscope (LEO 1430VP). The AMGC was dried 
at room temperature and coated with a thin 
layer of carbon (about 100 Å) in vacuum and 
photographed in the electron microscope at 
X5000 magniﬁcation. 
FT-IR photoacoustic spectroscopy
Spectral data were collected by a Perkin Elmer 
460 Spectrum BXI spectrometer and a helium-
purged MTEC 300 photoacoustic cell. All the 
spectra were recorded over the 4000–400 cm-1 
region at a spectral resolution of 8 cm-1 and 
with the 1024 scans co-added. The spectra were 
normalized proportioning the sample spectrum 
with a carbon black spectrum [34].
Zeta Potential
The zeta potential of the AMGC particles was 
measured without any pretreatment by a MALVERN 
Nano-Z equipped with a microprocessor unit. The 
unit automatically calculates the electrophoretic 
mobility of the particles and converts it to the 
zeta potential using the Smoluchowski equation 
[37]. The zeta potential measurements were 
carried out as a function of pH. A sample of 0.05 
g AMGC and 50 mL distilled water containing 
the desired electrolyte was added to a beaker 
and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 10 min at 
20±1C. The samples were allowed to stand for 5 
min to let larger particles settle. 
Adsorption Studies
Monochlorophenols are solid at room 
temperature, except for 2-MCP, which is a liquid. Phenol and chlorophenols concentrations in the 
samples were determined using a colorimetric 
assay where the phenolic compounds within 
a sample react with 4-AAP in the presence of 
potassium ferricyanide reagent under alkaline 
conditions [5,24]. The phenolic compound assay 
contained sample solution (1.0 mL), 4-AAP (1.0 
mL, 2.0 mM), and potassium ferricyanide reagent 
(1.0 mL, 6 mM). The latter two reagents were 
prepared in phosphate buffer solution (pH 10, 100 
mM). The absorbance of the assay mixture was 
measured using a DR-5000 spectrophotometer. 
A blank containing distilled water, 4-AAP, and 
potassium ferricyanide reagent was used in each 
set of the assay. The experiments were carried 
out over the pH range 2.0–12.0 and temperature 
range 25–45°C to determine the effect of pH 
and temperature on the removal of phenol and 
chlorophenols. Each set of experiments was 
carried out in triplicate and the arithmetic mean 
values were calculated.
The AMGC was weighed and placed in flasks 
containing phenol or chlorophenols solutions at 
desired concentration. In order to evaluate kinetic 
data, separate flasks were prepared for each 
period from 15 min to 24 h. For each adsorption 
isotherm experiment, a known amount of the 
adsorbent was added to 20 mL of the solution 
ranging from 50 to 1000 mg/L in phenol and 
chlorophenol concentrations. The mixture was 
shaken in a temperature-controlled shaking 
water bath at a constant speed of 400 rpm for 
24 h. The solution and sorbent were separated 
by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and analyzed for 
phenol and chlorophenols concentrations. The 
concentration of phenol and chlorophenols was 
determined spectrophotometrically at a wave 
length of 510 nm.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
XRD Results
Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of 
AMGC. According to the most intense diffraction 
peaks, It contains clinoptilolite and heulandite 
as well as quartz, feldspar and smectite group 
clay mineral. The sharpness of the peaks and the 
negligible variation of their positions after the 
activation suggest a high crystallinity degree 
and structural stability of the materials. Thus, 239
 S. Uçar et al. / Hacettepe J. Biol. & Chem., 2015, 43 (3), 235-249
the applied treatments do not seem to provoke 
collapse or significant destruction of the zeolitic 
structure, at least detectable by this technique 
[38,39]. 
TG-DTA Experimental Results
The thermo analytical techniques TG/DTA can 
help us to understand the interactions between 
adsorbed water ion as well as the thermal behavior 
of zeolite. The thermogravimetric analysis shows 
the presence of various types of intact water and 
surface hydroxy species. Figure 2 shows TG-DTA 
curves of AMGC. 
The DTA curves of the AMGC forms display a 
single endotherm at temperature ranging from 35 
to 146°C as a result of a single-step dehydration process.  This shows the presence of water, and 
larger amounts of water desorbed from zeolite. 
Clinoptilolite belongs to the zeolite group that 
does not show major structural changes during 
dehydration process which exhibits continuous 
mass-loss curves as a function of temperature. 
Clinoptilolite structure remains stable up to 
temperatures between 700 and 800°C [29]. As 
can be seen in the Figure 2, the main structural 
changes occur at temperatures below or around 
250°C while the mass loss is constant at 
temperatures higher than 700°C [34].
In the temperature between 20-230°C 
desorption of zeolitic water is assumed to occur 
according to the Equation 1

The mass losses recorded by thermogravimetric 
analysis (TG) are shown in Figure 2. In the 
temperature range from 100 to 250°C, the rapid 
mass loss is documented by the steep slope of the 
TG curve as it is attributed to the loss of the water 
located in the zeolite cavities and bound to the 
nonframework cations. In the temperature range 
from 250 to 600oC, the mass loss is less and it is 
indicated by the slight slope of the TG curve. In 
the temperature range from 600 to 950oC, the 
rate of loss is even slower. In this temperature 
range, the remaining water is gradually removed.
SEM-EDX Microscopy Studies
The mineralogical and geochemical analysis 
showed that the clinoptilolite is the only zeolite 
mineral in tuff samples where the volcanic 
ash shards were altered to the aggregates of 
clinoptilolite crystallizes. SEM micrograph of 
AMGC is shown in Figure 3. The zeolitized tuffs 
have a texture with very high microporosity. The 
orthorhombic geometry of clinoptilolite has not 
changed much; probably there are changes in 
sharp edges and corners. In microphotos of samples (Figure 3), it is shown 
that conditions are favorable for development of 
clinoptilolite crystals. The fact that clinoptilolite 
minerals are intensely found in samples and 
there is no other high-temperature mineral in 
the environment may indicate that clinoptilolites 
were developed in low temperature. The average 
silica concentrations of AMGC are 70.37%. The 
wide distribution of zeolites in both regions is 
indicative of glass-enrichment of the volcanic 
products. In SEM microphotos of Figure 3A, AMGC 
is shown to complete their crystal development 
under favorable conditions.
FT-IR Experimental Results
FT-IR spectra is shown in Figure 4. It shows the 
presence of the same typical bands  after and 
before adsorption of AMGC [25].
There are two groups of frequencies of 
vibrations in all clinoptilolite: internal vibrations 
of T–O (considered insensitive to structure) 
and vibration of external linkages between 
tetrahedral bridges, due to topology and the 
mode of structural arrangement. The FT-IR band 
connected with the internal Si–O(Si) and Si–O(Al) 
Figure 3.  SEM micrograph and EDX analysis of AMGC. A: Before adsorption  of phenol; B: After adsorption of phenol.241
 S. Uçar et al. / Hacettepe J. Biol. & Chem., 2015, 43 (3), 235-249
vibrations in tetrahedral or alumina- and silica-
oxygen bridges lies in the range of 791.49-1055 
cm-1. The bands due to the presence of zeolite 
water lie in the range of 1600–3700 cm-1. There 
are several types of zeolitic water. The OH- group 
is less acidic if the number of aluminum atoms 
increases because Al is less electronegative. The 
OH stretching vibrations in the range of 3340-
3400 cm-1 are inherent for less acidic groups 
than that at 3630 cm-1. There are bands due to 
pseudo-lattice vibrations of structural units (500– 
700 cm-1). Embedding of non-tetrahedral cations 
into the aluminosilicate framework can change 
the FT-IR spectra in the range of pseudolattice 
vibrations at 700–500 cm-1. These changes are 
more often characterized by shifts in the bands of 
the framework vibrations [9,34].
 
The Zeta Potential Measurements
The variation of the zeta potential of AMGC is shown 
in Figure 5. The zeta potential measurements 
revealed that the AMGC surface acquires a 
negative charge in water at pH 3-11. This negative 
charge results from substitutions within the 
AMGC lattice of Al3+ for Si4+, the broken bonds at 
the Si– O–Si (siloxane group) of AMGC particularly 
generated at the particle surface during grinding 
(Figure 5) and the lattice imperfections.AMGC can be considered as a permanently 
charged mineral because of the isomorphic 
substitution. The decrease of the suspension pH 
results in a decrease of the negative potential 
due to the H+ adsorption on the negative charge 
centers. At around pH 3, the zeta potential is 
about -18 mV; this shows that the AMGC surface 
maintains its negative character even in very 
acidic conditions though most silicate or clay 
minerals have the isoelectric point (iep) of pH 2–4. 
This is attributed to the number of substitution, 
of Al3+ for Si4+, to be more than those of clay 
minerals and also to the higher positive charge 
deficiency of AMGC. As a result, the negatively 
charged surface of AMGC even at very acidic pH 
values may be an advantage for the electrostatic 
interactions of organic or inorganic cationic 
contaminants with AMGC [37].
Phenol and Chlorophenols Adsorption
AMGC was separated from the adsorption 
medium at the end of each experiment, and the 
concentration of the phenol and chlorophenols in 
the aqueous phase was measured by UV.  
In order to reduce measurement errors the 
UV absorption intensity of each equilibrium 
solution sample was measured three times and 
the average value was used to calculate the 
Figure 4.  AMGC’in Infrared spectrum. a) After adsorption of p-chlorophenol, b) Before adsorption.242
 S. Uçar et al. / Hacettepe J. Biol. & Chem., 2015, 43 (3), 235-249
equilibrium concentration based on a standard 
calibration curve, which correlation coefficient 
(R2) was 0.99. The amount of phenol and 
chlorophenols adsorbed onto the adsorbate qe 
(mg/g) were calculated according to: (Eq. 2)
qe=[(C0-CA )V]/m                                                       (2)
where qe is the amount of phenol and chlorophenols 
adsorbed onto the unit amount of AMGC (mg/g); 
Co and CA are the concentrations of the phenol 
and chlorophenols in the initial solution and in 
the aqueous phase after adsorption, respectively 
(mg/L); V is the volume of the aqueous phase (L); 
and m is the weight of the AMGC (g) [10,15].
The AMGC loaded 7.977 mg/g for phenol, 
9.846 mg/g for o-chlorophenol, 9.981 mg/g 
for m-chlorophenol and 8.241 mg/g for 
p-chlorophenol were placed in this adsorption 
medium and stirred at 400 rpm for 45 min at 
room temperature. The difference in adsorption 
behavior of the chlorophenol species compared 
to each other can be explained by the different 
affinity of the phenolic species for the reactive 
functional groups in AMGC. A difference in 
geometrical structure is most probably also the 
case for the AMGC, resulting in a relatively high 
adsorption of m-chlorophenol [10]. The final 
phenol and chlorophenols concentrations in the 
aqueous phase were determined by using UV. The 
desorption ratio was calculated from the amount 
of phenol and chlorophenols initially loaded on the AMGC and the final concentration of phenol 
and chlorophenols in the desorption medium [25].
Recent literature on the methods of removal 
of phenol and their compounds from wastewater 
focuses on adsorption process[40]. As with 
other materials, clay materials can be modified 
to improve their adsorption capacity. Kaleta [41] 
utilized modified Clarion clay and clinoptilolite 
as adsorbents for the removal of phenolic 
compounds from water. Adsorption capacities 
are substantially improved by modifying the 
clay materials. The amount of adsorption was 
found to be dependent on the relative energies 
of adsorbent–adsorbate, adsorbate solvent and 
adsorbate–adsorbate interaction. The removal 
of phenol from aqueous solutions by adsorption 
using three different adsorbents, clinoptilolite, 
montmorillonite, and hydrotalcite (HT) was 
studied by Yapar and Yilmaz [42]. Clinoptilolite 
was modified using cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB) and hydrotalcite was calcined 
by heating to 550°C. Calcined hydrotalcite (HTC) 
was found to be the best among the studied 
adsorbents. Naturally occurring bentonite is able 
to adsorb phenol from aqueous solutions [43].
Adsorption Time
The equilibrium adsorption time of phenol 
and chlorophenols (i.e. o-chlorophenol, 
m-chlorophenol, p-chlorophenol) on the AMGC 
was investigated (Figure 6). Note that these 
batch experiments were performed by using 
Figure 5.  The variation of the zeta potential  of AMGC versus pH.243
 S. Uçar et al. / Hacettepe J. Biol. & Chem., 2015, 43 (3), 235-249
single solutions of the concerned phenol and 
chlorophenols. The initial concentrations of the 
phenol and chlorophenols within the aqueous 
phase were kept constant at 200 mg/L. These 
kinetic studies point out that the phenol 
adsorption is carried out at a rapid rate in the 
first 15 min. Then the adsorption is slower down, 
possibly due to the less active adsorption sites 
being available and/or the difficulty of the edge 
molecules in diffusing the small adsorbents’ pores 
[16]. Saturation levels are gradually reached within 
30 min for all phenol and chlorophenols. Notice 
that m-chlorophenol was adsorbed much faster 
than other chlorophenols due to the much higher 
affinity of the AMGC. The adsorption rate order 
was as follows: m-chlorophenol, o-chlorophenol, 
p-chlorophenol and phenol. Adsorption of 
phenolic species was quite fast especially when 
the initial solution concentration was high. 
Note that there are several parameters that 
determine the adsorption rate such as stirring 
(or flow) rate of the aqueous phase, structural 
properties of the sorbent (e.g. porosity, surface 
area), amount of sorbent, adsorbate properties 
(e.g. molecular weight), initial concentration of 
phenolic species and of course existence of other 
species that may compete with the phenolic 
species of interest for the active adsorption 
sites. Therefore, it is very difficult to compare 
the adsorption rates reported. However, the 
adsorption rates obtained with the  AMGC 
produced by us seem to be very satisfactory [25].Effect of Initial Concentration of Phenol and 
Chlorophenols
The phenol and chlorophenols adsorption 
capacities of the  AMGC are given as a function 
of the initial concentration of phenol and 
chlorophenols within the aqueous phase in Figure 
7. It was observed that the amount of adsorption 
was significantly increased with the initial 
concentration from 50 to 10000 mg/L. 
The maximum adsorption capacities of the 
AMGC in the studied range are 7.977 mg/g for 
phenol, 9.846 mg/g for o-chlorophenol, 9.981 
mg/g for m-chlorophenol, and 8.241 mg/g for 
p-chlorophenol  at 6.25 pH, which correspond 
to an initial concentration of 200 mg/L. The 
results suggest that the affinity of phenol 
and chlorophenols toward adsorption follows 
the order  m-chlorophenol > o-chlorophenol > 
p-chlorophenol  > phenol. 
The difference in adsorption behavior of 
phenol and chlorophenol species compared 
to each other can be explained by the different 
affinity of the phenolic species for the reactive 
functional groups in the AMGC. A difference in 
geometrical structure is the most probably also 
the case for AMGC, resulting in a relatively high 
adsorption of m-chlorophenol [10].
The phenol and chlorophenols removal by 
the AMGC are given as a function of the initial 
concentration of phenol and chlorophenols 
Figure 6.  Adsorption rates of phenol on the AMGC at 25°C. (Initial concentration: 200 mg/L; pH= 6.25).244

within the aqueous phase in Figure 8. Phenol 
and chlorophenols maximum removal efficiency 
by AMGC were 89.01 for phenol, 99.21 for 
m-chlorophenol, and 96.41 for p-chlorophenol.
Effect of pH
The effect of pH on adsorption of phenol and 
chlorophenols is shown in Figure 9. The effect of 
pH less than 5 was not investigated because zeolite 
is not stable at pH below 5.0 [19]. It was observed 
that the adsorption capacities decreased with 
increasing pH. The maximum adsorption of phenol 
and chlorophenols were at approximately pH 6.25 
for all species. However, the adsorption capacity 
was considerably decreased when the pH of the 
initial solution was above 8.0. The interaction 
forces between chlorophenols and  clinoptilolite 
are rather weak in the neutral solutions. The 
decrease in adsorption capacity may also be due 
to the competing hydroxide ions [10]. 
Effect of Thermodynamic Parameters
Thermodynamic parameters free energy of 
sorption (G) can be evaluated with the following 
equations [17]:
Kd=qe⁄Ce       
where Kd is the sorption distribution coefficient.
The Kd values are used in following equation to 
determine the Gibbs free energy of sorption 
process at different temperatures.∆G0=-RTlnKd 
where ∆G is the free energy of sorption (kJ/
mol), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and R is 
the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol.K). 
Thermodynamic parameters for phenol and 
chlorophenols adsorption on AMGC were given in 
Table 2.
The negative values of free energy change ( ∆G) 
indicate the spontaneous nature of the adsorption 
process. The negative values of G confirm the 
feasibility of the process and the spontaneous 
nature of sorption with a high preference of 
phenol and chlorophenols on AMGC  [44,45] 
However, the negative ∆G value decreased with 
an increase in temperature, indicating that the 
spontaneous nature of adsorption is inversely 
proportional to the temperature.
In conclusion, the usage of AMGC as 
an adsorbent could be an alternative for 
commercially available carbon due to its low cost 
and good efficiency.
Reusability of the Adsorbent
In order to determine the adsorptive capacity of 
the adsorbent after each cycle an experiment 
was performed with the used adsorbent to 
determine its reusability. Desorption of phenol 
and chlorophenols was achieved by using ethanol 
solution (30% v/v). Significant decline in the

removal efficiency was observed for subsequent 
adsorption. As the number of adsorption cycles 
increases the adsorptive capacity of the adsorbent 
decreases because with successive adsorption 
the active sites of the adsorbent decreases which 
results in the decrease in its removal efficiency 
[19]. 
Adsorption Isotherms
Freundlich Adsorption Isotherms
This isotherm developed by Freundlich (1906) 
describes the equilibrium on heterogeneous 
surfaces and does not assume monolayer 
capacity. It is given by (Eq. 5).
qe=KFCe1⁄n      (5)
where qe is the equilibrium amount of solute 
adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent (mg/g), Ce 
is the equilibrium concentration of solute in bulk 
solution (mg/L), KF is a constant indicative of the 
relative adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 
(mg/g) (mg/L)n, and the constant 1/n indicates 
the intensity of the adsorption (Table 3) [6].
It was found that Freundlich adsorption 
isotherm is the most suitable model and 
adsorption mechanism is physical.  
Mechanism of Adsorption
The results showed that kinetic data were followed 
more closely the pseudo-second order model 
than the pseudo-first order. Kinetic studies have 
been performed to understand the mechanism 
of adsorption. The adsorption occurred via a film 
diffusion mechanism at lower concentrations and 
via particle diffusion at higher concentrations.
The pseudo-second order reaction model 
based on sorption equilibrium capacity may be 
expressed as
  dq⁄dt=k2 (qe-qt )2         (6)
After integrating Eq. (6) for the following 
boundary condition and rearranging it to obtain 
the linearized form which is shown as follows: t=0, 
qt =0, t = t, qt = qt
t⁄(qt=1⁄(k2 qe2 )+ 1⁄(qe t))     (7)h=k2 qe2   (8)     
where qe is the amount of the solute sorbed at 
equilibrium (mg/g), k2 is the equilibrium rate 
constant of pseudo-second order (g/mg min), h is 
the initial sorption rate (mg/g min).
These constants can be determined by 
plotting t/qt against t [17,46].
The values of kinetic constants for phenol and 
chlorophenols sorption onto AMGC are presented 
in Table 4. Good correlation coefficients were 
obtained for the pseudo-second order kinetic 
model, which shows that the uptake process 
follows the pseudo-second order rate expression 
with the correlation coefficients higher than 0.99 
[17].
MCPs are represented by a Cl atom and an 
OH group, bound to the aromatic ring. Functional 
group position of the molecule affects vibrational 
frequencies. It was obtained that the closer the Cl 
atom to OH group of the ring, the higher the wave 
number of OH group for MCPs [9]. Hydrogen 
bonding refers to a stronger than usual dipole 
attraction between molecules in which hydrogen 
is bonded to a highly electronegative atom. 
Chlorophenols and polar solvent molecule (e.g., 
water, alcohol) could act as proton donors as well 
as proton acceptors and two types of hydrogen 
bonds are possible. When chlorophenol is the 
proton donor, electronic charge is transferred 
from the solvent to the phenolic oxygen and in 
consequence intermolecular hydrogen bonds may 
be formed. The influence of hydrogen bonding on 
rate of reaction, especially radicals reaction, is 
discussed in various papers. Due to type of polar 
group, in chlorophenol two types of intermolecular 
hydrogen bonds, between two chlorophenol 
molecules, i.e., HO· · ·HO, and OH· · ·Cl can be 
formed. The interactions between hydrogen and 
chlorine atoms are weaker than those between 
hydrogen and oxygen atoms, therefore strong 
shifts of these bands can be observed in the case 
of HO· · ·HO type of hydrogen bonds [47]. There 
isn’t electron attractive group such as chlorine 
in phenol, so it is observed less adsorption than 
other chlorine derivatives on clinoptilolite.247

CONCLUSIONS
 
Wastewaters containing phenolic compounds 
present a serious problem. Phenol-containing 
wastewater may not be conducted into open 
water without treatment because of the toxicity 
of phenol. 
The present studies lead to the following 
conclusions: AMGC materials are proving to 
be an effective new class of adsorbents for the 
adsorption of phenolic compounds. It has good 
physical as well chemical stability; hence it can be 
used for various environmental applications. 
The structural stability of the zeolite was not 
significantly affected by the acid treatment. A 
considerable increase in the micropore volume 
was also observed in AMGC after the acid 
treatment.
The removal of phenol and chlorophenols at 
neutral pH is high as compared to alkaline pH 
and this may be attributed to the fact that at 
higher pH it form phenolate ion, which decrease 
its adsorption. The adsorption of phenol and 
chlorophenols decreased with increasing pH after 
neutral pH. 
The sorption of chlorophenols was high 
as compared to phenol, which may be due to 
more hydrophobic nature of chlorophenols. The 
maximum adsorption capacities of these  AMGC 
from their single solutions were 9.981 mg/g for m-chlorophenol, 9.846 mg/g for o-chlorophenol, 
8.241 mg/g for p-chlorophenol and 7.977 mg/g 
for phenol. The affinity order was as follows: 
m-chlorophenol > o-chlorophenol > p-chlorophenol  
> phenol. The difference in adsorption order of 
chlorophenols compared to each other can be 
explained by the different affinity of the phenolic 
species in  AMGC. 
For AMGC the elimination of greater amounts 
of physically bonded water is observed up to 
120oC. Thermogravimetric curves showed no 
noticeable breaks in the mass-loss curve. The 
mass losses above 500oC may be caused by 
dehydroxylation. In general, the dehydroxylation 
of the clinoptilolite is slow and occurs in this case 
in the range 600–800oC.
In conclusion the use of low-cost adsorbents 
may have a great contribute to the sustainability 
of the surrounding environment. Undoubtedly 
low-cost adsorbents offer a lot of promising 
benefits for commercial purpose in the future.
