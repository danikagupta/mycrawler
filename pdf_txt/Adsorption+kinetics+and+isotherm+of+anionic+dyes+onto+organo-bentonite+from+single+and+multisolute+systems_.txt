Abstract  
The present work focused on the preparation of hybrid -bentonite adsorbents by treating sodium 
bentonite  (Na-B) with different amounts of hexadecylt rimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA+ 
Br-), corresponding to 50, 100 and 200% the value of the cation exchange capacity (CEC) . The 
samples prepared, namely 50HDTMA -B, 100HDTMA and 200HDTMA -B, were characterized 
by dif ferent techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X -ray 
diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA ).  The removal e fficiency of two 
anionic dyes, namely . Congo Red (CR) and Indigo Carmine (IC), from aqueous solutions, was 
studied as a function of the amount of  HDTMA , contact time, hybrid adsorbent and initial dye 
concentration. In addition, a  kinetic study was conducted to fit the experimental data in order 
to compare the adsorption rate constants and the equilibrium  sorption capacities of anionic dyes 
on the prepared materials. The results obtained indicated that the adsorption kinetics of clay 
samples could be best described by the pseudo -second -order model, and the adsorption capacity 
of the hybrid -Bentonite  is affected by the amount of modifier used.  Based on Weber -Morris 
intra-particle diffusion equation, it was found that the  
CR and IC dyes diffused faster as the cationic surfactant loading increased from 0 to 100% of 
the CEC value . The Langmuir isotherm exhibited the best fit, with an adsorption c apacity equal 
to 292 and 289 mg g-1, for CR and IC dyes, respectively.

  Introduction  
Textile dyeing is a process that has been practiced since  the early days of mankind . At the 
beginning, only natural dyes were used, but afterwards, they were progressively replaced by 
synthetic dyes [1] The presence of dyestuffs in effluents discharged  from factories  does pose 
serious threats to the environment when they are released in the biosphere without prior 
treatment. Dyestuffs are dangerous pollutants that have serious effects on the aquatic flora and 
fauna, but also on the human and a nimal populations that consume untreated water as well .[2] 
Many synthetic coloring dyes can be seriously harmful to public health and may engender 
allergies in humans; they can also affect the aquatic life and even the food chain .[3]. Congo red 
(CR) and indigo carmine (IC) have extensively been applied in textile dyeing processes due to 
their technical simplicity , low purchase and production costs, ease of application, durability and 
also because they are available in various colors .[4, 5] These two dyes (CR and IC) are 
classified as azo dyes and vat dyes, respectively; they both carry negative charges on their 
molecules. Furth ermore, i t has widely been reported that the discharge of CR and IC into the 
environment may lead to skin and eye irritation, injuries to the cornea and conjunctiva, 
dermatitis and cancer for humans .[6, 7] For this reason, an effective treatment is urgently 
required for the purpose of eliminating these harmful substances from the environment. Indeed, 
several  techniques, such as coagulation and flocculation, reverse osmosis, oxidation or 
chemical reduction, adsorption, photocatalytic degradation, etc., have been  employed in the 
removal of dyes from aqueous systems .[8, 9] 
The adsorption technique proved to be effective and relatively cheap for the elimination of 
dyes[10] because this process is highly effective in purify ing contaminated water. The use of 
clays as adsorbents is actually of great interest in the treatment of industrial wastewater because 
they present high surface area, with a negative charge, high cation exchange capacity and wide 
availability in nature.  Nowadays, it is widely admitted that natural clays are poor adsorbents of anionic dyes. For this 
reason, it was decided to modify these natural clays by means of surfactants, by introducing an 
organic phase on the clay interlayer surface that acts as a par titioning medium for the anionic 
contaminants. Recent works have suggested that chemically modified clays represent a novel  
and promising class  of adsorbent  materials . Such modification may consist of replacing the 
compensating ions by alkyl ammonium ions.  The clay surface is thus converted from an initially 
hydrophilic state to a hydrophobic state, which makes it possible to give rise to strong 
interactions with organic molecules either in the vapor state or dissolved in water.  The 
adsorption of anionic dy es on organo -clays has been extensively investigated .[11, 12] The 
adsorption capacity and adsorption process depend on the molecular structure, amount of 
modifier or ammonium cations, chemical properties of organic compounds, and surface area of 
clay mineral .[13-15]. Few stu dies are available on the removal of CR and IC dyes by hybrid - 
clays. In this context, Dazhong Shen et al. [16] were able to remove 95% IC from water using 
polyd iallydimethylammonium modified Bentonite  (PDADMA –Bentonite ) at a dosage of 0.75 
g L−1.  As for Chenglong Xia et al. [17], they reported that the adsorption capacities of hectorites 
modified with cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)  and octadecylamine, for CR dye, 
were greatly improved compared to natural hectorite. In addition, Li Wang et al. [18] indicated 
that the synergistic effects of several factors, such as the changes in the crystalline structure, 
specific surface area and average pore size, may help to increase the adsorption capacity of 
cethyltrimethylammonium -modified montmorillonite (CTAB -MMT) when appropriate 
amounts of CTAB are used (2.0 CEC) in the case of CR dye elimination.  The present study 
aimed at preparing hybrid -clays through the modification of Bentonite  clay using cationic 
surfactants. Its main purpose consisted in highlighting the remarkable potential of 
hexadecyltrimethylammonium -exchanged Bentonite  for the removal of anionic dyes from 
aqueous solutions. Indeed, two dyes, i.e. an azo dye CR and a vat dye IC, were chosen  as target pollutants for the purpose of investigating and understanding the adsorption behavior in terms 
of adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherms. The effects of various parameters, like the 
amount of surfactant , contact time, adsorbent dosage and  initial dyes concentration, were 
investigated for the removal of dyes from aqueous solutions.  
 
Materials and methods  
 
Preparation an d characteristics of Bentonite  
The natural Bentonite  (B) used in this study was acquired from the mining site of Maghnia , a 
small town in the extreme northwestern region of Algeria. Afterwards, it was purified and then 
converted to its sodic  form, namely sodium Bentonite  (Na-B), according to the method 
published in a previous study .[19] The chemical compositions of B and Na -B are shown in 
Table 1 . 
Insert  Table 1.  
Furthermore, the specific surfac e area was determined from the N 2 gas adsorption isotherm at 
77 K using a Volumetric Analyzer (Nova -1000). Moreover, t he cation exchange capacity (CEC) 
of clay samples was calculated by means of the  methylene blue adsorption method [20] and 
was found to be 37 meq/100 g for dry natural Bentonite  and 93 meq/100 g for dry  sodic 
Bentonite . The results obtained indicated that the BET specific surface area increased from 
45.04  m2 g-1 in natural Bentonite  (B) to 66.21 m2 g-1 in sodium Bentonite  (Na-B). 
  Reagents  
The surfactant hexadecyltrimenthylammonium bromide, denoted as HDTMA+ Br- (C19 H42 Br 
N), and the anionic dyes used in this study, with purity > 99%, were purchased from Biochem. 
The chemical structures and properties of these dyes are clearly depicted in Table 2 . 
Insert  Table 2.  
Preparation and characterization of hybrid -Bentonite s 
HDTMA -intercalated Bentonite  samples were prepared by intercalation of the ammonium 
cation into the Na –B suspension (5% clay in water (w/w)), based on a previously described 
procedure  [21] which consists of using amounts of HDTMA corresponding to 50, 100 and 
200% of the cation exchange capacity of Na -B; these amounts were next dissolved in 500 mL 
of distilled water and the resulting mi xtures were then added to 25g Na -B. The admixture was 
first agitated for 24 h at room temperature and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. 
Afterwards, the suspension obtained was filtered, washed several times with distilled water 
(until a negative bro mide test  was obtained  with 0.1 M of AgNO 3) and then dried at 70°C, for 
a period of 24 h. The materials obtained were designated as 50HDTMA -B, 100HDTMA -B and 
200HDTMA -B. The hybrid -Bentonite  samples were compared with sodium Bentonite  by 
means of X -ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and 
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). The infrared spectra of clay samples were recorded within 
the wavenumber range extending from 500 to 4000 cm-1 using a Perkin Elmer F T-IR 
Spectrophotometer. Moreover, the X -ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Philips 
X-Pert diffractometer using Ni -filtered Cu Ka radiation.  
  Adsorption experiments  
The adsorption study was conducted  on synthetic wastewater containing Congo red or indigo 
carmine dyes. An aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving dyes in deionizer water to the 
desired concentration.  With regard to the kinetic study, each experiment was carried out in a 
100 mL Erlenme yer flask containing 25 mL  of anionic dye solution (50 mg L-1) and 25 mg of 
adsorbent at natural pH 6.6; the mixture was then subjected to stirring at the speed of 250 rpm. 
Afterwards, the samples were withdrawn from time to time, up to 180 min, and aliquo ts were 
taken from theses samples and centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The concentration of dye in the 
supernatant was quantified by the Analytik Jena (SPECORD210) UV -vis spectrophotometer at 
λmax and was subtracted  from the initial concentration in order to determine the amounts of dye 
adsorbed in each case. The amount adsorbed per mass unit of adsorbent at time t (qt), the amount 
adsorbed per mass unit of adsorbent at equilibrium ( qe) and the adsorption yield ( Y) were 
calculated using the following expressions:  
 𝑞𝑡=(𝐶0−𝐶𝑡) 𝑉
𝑚   (1) 
 𝑞𝑒=(𝐶0−𝐶𝑒) 𝑉
𝑚    (2) 
𝑌(%)=(1−𝐶𝑡
𝐶0)100  (3) 
Note that C0 and Ce are the initial and equ ilibrium dye concentrations (mg L-1), respectively; Ct 
is the concentration of dye within the aqueous solutions at time t (mg L-1), qt is the amount of 
dye adsorbed per mass unit of adsorbent at time t (mg g-1), V is the volume of the aqueous 
solution (L) and m is the amount of adsorbent (g).  Furthermore, the adsorption isotherms were 
obtained at (20±2) °C by mixing 25 mg of 100HDTMA -B with 25 mL of dye solution (m/v = 
1g L-1) at various in itial concentrations (20 –500 mg L-1) under continuous and vigorous stirring 
(250 rpm). The contact time was set to 60 min ( equilibrium time), time beyond which no 
significant variation in dye concentration was observed. The amount of dye adsorbed was 
determined after that time.  The effect of the solid/solution ratio (m/v) on the amount of adsorbed dye was investigated both on Na-B and 100HDTMA -B, for a constant initial concentration of 
dye (C 0 = 50 mg L-1, pH = 6.6), while the (m/v) ratio was varied within the range extending 
from  0.1 to 2 g L-1. 
 
Results and discussion  
Characterization of adsorbents  
The FTIR spectra of the adsorbent samples are illustrated in Figure 1.  The characteristic 
absorption bands of the clay phase are those corresponding to Si -O, Si -O-M, M -O-H where M 
stands for Al, Fe and Mg. These chemical elements are found between the anio ns and cations 
located in the octahedral and tetrahedral sheets with a large number of OH groups .[19] 
It should also be mentioned that the appearance of bands attributed to the surfactants in the 
modified clays is in the range of 2849 -2914 cm-1 corresponding to the anti -symmetrical and 
symmetrical stretching vibration modes of the CH bonds in a CH 2 or CH 3 environment .[22] In 
addition, the deformation vibration of C -H bond was observed at 1475 cm-1. It is important to 
note that the intensity of C -H bands in modified clays increased as the amount  of surfactant 
increased . The intense absorption band at around 1472 cm-1 can be associated to the C –H 
symmetric bending of ammonium groups (N+-CH 3) from the HDTMA. These bands are 
commonly found in hybrid -clays containing alkylamine surfactants .[21]. Furthermore, the 
characteristic  stretching vibration  bond of isolated hydroxyl groups of Si -OH is observed at 
3623 cm-1 , however, the appearance of the band between 3540 and 3200 cm-1 is attributed to 
the valence vibrations of adjacent and ge miny polymeric hydroxyl groups . As can be observed 
from the spec tra of unmodified and modified Bentonite  that the region between 3650 and 3200 
cm-1 which characterize a different group of OH is still unchanged which means probably that 
the most amount of surfactant is intercalated into basal space of Bentonite . This evidence is 
supported by the XRD results .  In addition, the deformation O -H ba nd of the adsorbed water molecules is attributed to 1630  
cm-1. It is wise observed that this band decreases when the surfactant increase this phenomenon 
is in accordance w ith the hydrophobic character. B ecause it is widely known that the 
hydrophobic character increase when the amount of surfactant increase and hence the 
deformation band of OH physis orbed decreases . This statement is in agreement with that given 
by Zaghouane et al .[23] 
Insert Figure 1.  
In order to determine the influence of the surfactant loading on the weight loss, some Bentonite  
samples were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative 
thermogravimetry (DTG). For this, approximately 20 mg of a sample were heated  from 20 to 
1000 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, under nitrogen atmosphere. The TGA and DTG  data of 
sodium Bentonite  (Na-B) and hybrid - Bentonite s are plotted in Figure 2 . From the TGA curve 
of Na -B, two major weight loss stages were observed. The first  one was at 99.26 °C (6.2 %), 
due to the dehydration of the materials; it is attributed to the interlayer adsorption of water . [24] 
However, the  other weight loss stage was at 645.50 °C (2.2 %) and is attributed to the 
dehydroxylation of montmorillonite .[25] With regard to the surfactant -modified Bentonite s, the 
evolution of weight loss can be divided into three steps. The first one is below 200 °C; the 
weight loss is assigned to the dehydration of physically adsorbed water. It is interesting to note 
from the plots that H DTMA -B shows a lower weight loss than Na -B, which indicates that less 
free water exists in hybrid -Bentonite s; this means  that the surface energy of clay was reduced 
by the adsorbed HDTMA, and the hydrophilic silicate surface was converted into a hydrophobi c 
silicate surface .[26] The second step is with in the temperature range 200 -500 °C; it corresponds 
to the decomposition of the intercalated surfactant. In this interval, the thermal gravimetric 
analysis (TGA) curves show an increase in the weight loss as the amount of alkyl ammonium 
loading grows, i.e. 5 .0% (50HDTMA -B), 16.5% (100HDTMA -B) and 30.1% (200HDTMA -B). In contrast, the DTG curves indicate that the temperature peaks resulting from thermal 
decomposition decreased from 296.74 °C for 50HDTMA -B to 276.84 ° C for 200HDTMA -B, 
as can be seen in Figure 2.  Similar observations have been reported in previous studies  using 
various surfactant -modified clays . [26, 27] The third step concerns the temperature range from 
550 °C to 750°C where the weight loss is essentially attributed to the dehydroxylation of OH 
units.  
Insert Figure 2.  
The XRD patterns of sodic Bentonite  and HDTMA -modified Bentonite  are clearly illustrate d 
in Figure 3 . The interlayer distance (d 001) was calculated from the measured diffraction angle 
(2θ) value using Bragg’s equation (inset in Figure 3). The interlayer expansion of hybrid -
Bent onite can be clearly observed as the amount of hexadecyltrimethylammonium surfactant 
increases. When the surfactant loading is around 50% of CEC, the d 001 spacing is approximately 
equal to 1.79 nm. This augmentation was assigned to the lateral bilayer of the HDTMA+ cation 
arrangement model .[28] The interlayer spacing in the 100HDTMA -B sample reaches the 
maximum value of 2.99 nm, with a shoulder at 1.98 nm, when the surfactant loading is 100% 
of CEC. This finding confirms the coexistence of pseudotrimolecular and paraffin -type 
arrangements. [29] However, the d 001 diffraction peak of the 200HDTMA -B sample 
disappeared, which su ggests that Bentonite  is fully exfoliated.  
Insert Figure 3 . 
 
  Adsorption kinetics  
The use of sodic Bentonite  and synthesized hybrid -Bentonite  in the adsorption of anionic dyes 
CR and IC taken as model  pollutants  was investigated. Figure 4  indicates that  the adsorption 
yield  of dyes on Bentonite  samples increased as contact time augmented to reach the highest 
sorption percent after 60 min. It is worth mentioning that the adsorption process of CR and IC 
dyes on HDTMA -modified Bentonite  was relatively fast a t the beginning. However, the  curves 
corresponding to the IC/Na -B, CR/Na -B and IC/ 50-HDTMA -B systems indicate that the 
adsorption operation started slowing down until equilibrium. Moreover, the adsorption of IC 
on 200HDTMA -B increased with increasing conta ct time to reach a maximum adsorption 
percentage after 10 min, followed by a decrease until reaching equilibrium after 120 min (Fig. 
4b). 
Insert Figure 4.  
Figure 5  displays the effect of the amounts of HDTMA on the adsorption efficiency of CR and 
IC onto Bentonite  samples, at equilibrium. This same figure indicates that the percentage of 
anionic dye sorption gradually increased as the ammonium surfactant loading went up from 0% 
CEC to 100% CEC.  However, the adsorption yield decreased when the surfactant lo ading 
reached 200% CEC. For example, the maximum yields of CR adsorption on various Bentonite  
adsorbents, namely Na -B, 50HDTMA -B, 100HDTMA -B and 200HDTMA -B, were 14.5, 86.2, 
98.7 and 80.5%, respectively. This is mainly due to the fact that  increasing the a mount of 
HDTMA cau ses them to densely pack between the layers. Therefore, it may be said that the CR 
and IC dyes cannot penetrate into the interlayer space with high packing density, which leads 
to lower removal efficiency .[30] Comparison of CR with IC dyes suggests that the removal 
efficiency for CR is significantly larger than that for IC under the same modifier loadings.  
Insert Figure 5 . In order to understand the dynamics of adsorption, the experimental data of the kinetic s tudy 
were examined using the pseudo -first-order and the pseudo -second -order adsorption models. 
The pseudo -first-order kinetic model, also described by the Lagergren kinetic equation, is 
widely employed to understand the kinetic behavior of the system .[31] It is generally expressed 
by the following equation  [32]: 
log(𝑞𝑒−𝑞𝑡)=𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑞𝑒−(𝑘1
2.303)𝑡   (4) 
The pseudo -second -order kinetic model is given by the equation [33]: 
𝑡
𝑞𝑡=1
𝑘2𝑞𝑒2+1
𝑞𝑒𝑡     (5) 
Where qe and qt (mg g-1) are the amounts of dye sorbed at equilibrium and at time t, respectively; 
k1 and k2 are the equilibrium rate constants of the pseudo -first-order model (min-1) and the 
pseudo -second -order model (g mg-1 min-1), respectively.  
Insert Figure 6.  
Insert Table 3.  
The fitting curves  of the kinetic  model to the experimental  data are shown in Figure  6, and the 
results are summarized in Table 3  (the pseudo -first-order fitting plots are not presented here).  
It can clearly be seen that the correlation coefficients (R2) are close to unity , and the 
experimental values of the adsorption capacity ( qe,exp) agree well with the calculated values 
(qe,cal) in the pseudo -second -order model. This implies that the adsorption kinetics of anionic 
dyes onto Na -B and surfactant -modified Bentonite  obeys the pseudo -second -order model. 
Similar results have been reported b y T.S. Anirudhan  et al. [34] in the adsorption of basic dyes 
such as methylene blue, crystal violet and Rhodamine B, on Hexadecyltrimethylammonium 
chloride -modified Bentonite  clay. I t is also worth recalling that Daimei Chen et al. [35] 
conducted a study on the removal of methyl orange using anion -cationic surfactant -modified 
Bentonite , and Adarsh et al [36] examined the adsorption of  Remazol Brilliant Blue R on 
organo -attapulgite and hybrid -Bentonite . Moreover, several investigators  [18, 37] indicated that the pseudo -second -order model is based on the assumption that chemisorption may  be the rate -
limiting step, involving covalent or ionic bonds between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. The 
amount of CR dye removed at equilibrium increased in th e following order:  Na-B < 
200HDTMA -B < 50HDTMA -B < 100HDTMA -B. It was observed that the amounts of dye 
adsorbed are not proportional to the rates of surfactant intercalation into Bentonite . This can 
certainly be explained  by the fact that the interaction between the adsorbent and dyes is strongly 
influenced by the interaction between silica and alumina sheets in montmorillonite in spite of 
the hydrophobic sites created by the intercalated HDTMA. In the case of 100HDTMA -B, when 
the amount of intercalated surfactant was 100% CEC, the interaction between the Bentonite  
surface and ammonium cations was significantly high, which allowed adsorbing a large amount 
of dyes.  On the other hand, when a large quantity of HDTMA was added,  the alkyl chains 
played a predominant role on clay surface and the interactions between the hydrocarbon chains 
of the surfactant were relatively strong, which led to a weak interaction between the adsorbate 
and the adsorbent surface. However, with further  addition of surfactant, the contribution of 
hydrocarbon chains to the surface was not significant, given the porous structure of 
montmorillonite . [21] This was inferred from the adsorption capacity of 200HDTMA -B which 
was lower than that of 100HDTMA -B. This result is similar to that found by other authors on 
the behavior of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide -modified Bentonite  with respect to 
uranium  [38] and also on the adsorption of aniline on hybrid -Bentonite  modified with bis-
pyridinium dibromides . [39] These same authors indicated that the decrease in adsorption 
capacity with the increase in cationic surfactant loading is due to the steric hindrance caused by 
the surfactant packing density.  
Furthermore, the  amounts of CR and IC dyes removed by different  types of adsorbents at 
equilibrium (qe), according to the pseudo -second -order model, are summarized in Table 4.  Note 
that at  50 mg L-1 of ini tial dye concentration, 49.3 mg g-1 of CR and 45.5 mg g-1 of IC were removed by the adsorbent 100HDTMA -B, when the  ratio ( m/v) is equal to unity  and pH = 6.6. 
In comparison with other materials, the amounts of anionic dyes adsorbed onto the adsorbents 
considered in this study at equilibrium are lower than those sorbed on nanocomposites, but are 
higher than those remov ed by cethyltrimethylammonium bromide -modified kaolin , surfactant 
modified pumice, metal hydroxides sludge and CaCO 3-loaded cellulose aerogel. This can 
certainly be attributed to the fact that the adsorbents used in this  paper have a larger adsorption 
capacity than many reported  adsorbents.  
Insert Table 4.  
In this case, the CR and IC molecules were probably transported by the adsorbent particles 
following the intra -particle diffusion process because  of the porosity of organo -clays. For the 
purpose of explaining the adsorption mechanism of both CR and IC dyes, it was decided to use 
the Weber and Morris equation given below [40]: 
𝑞𝑡= 𝑘𝑖𝑑𝑡0.5+ 𝐼   (6) 
This equation originates from Fick’s second law. Note that k id is the intra -particle diffusion rate 
constant (mg g-1 min-0.5) and I is the intercept. The values recorded for I help to make an 
approximation of the boundary layer  thickness. It is worth noting that the larger the value of I, 
the greater the boundary layer effect. In addition, the deviation of the straight line from the 
origin may be attributed to the weight transfer difference between the initial and final adsorpti on 
stages .[41] The intra -particle diffusion model suggests that the plot of q t versus t0.5 should be 
linear. In theory, these types of plots may present a multilinearity, indicating that two  or more 
stages are taking place [42]. Figure 7  displays the amount of anionic dyes adsorbed per unit 
mass of a dsorbent, q t versus  t0.5 for the adsorption of CR and IC dyes. Since the graph does not 
pass through the origin, then it may be concluded  there is some degree of boundary layer 
control. Therefore, the intra -particle diffusion is not the only rate controlling step, but other 
processes can also control the rate of adsorption of anionic dyes .[43] Indeed, the curves show that two steps occu r during the adsorption process. The first stage is a gradual adsorption, where 
the diffusion of dye molecules on the surface of the adsorbents can be rate -controlling. Final 
equilibrium is reached during the second stage. A linear equation was fitted to  the experimental 
data obtained in the first 20 minutes . The values obtained for k id, I, and R2 are given  in Table 
3, which  indicates that the adsorption rate constant k id onto HDTMA -modified Bentonite  was 
far larger than that onto Na -B. Therefore, the diffusion of CR or IC dyes had to be faster with 
the increase in cationic surfactant loading from 0 to 100% CEC, which suggests that the 
adsorption of anionic dyes is faster with increased adsorbent organo -philicity  [44] However, 
dye diffusion was slower in the case of 200HDTMA -B. In addition, the diffusion rate for CR 
dye at the surface of the material or across the inter -lamellar space was faster than for the IC 
dye. 
Insert Figure 7.  
 
Effect of adsorbent dosage (solid/solution ratio)  
The effect of the solid/solution ratio  on the adsorption efficiency of CR and IC dyes both on 
Na-B and 100HDTMA -B is shown in Figure 8 . It can be observed that the percentage removal 
of CR dye increased  from 0.8 to 21.9 % and from 53.4 to 99.1% when  the dosages of Na -B and  
100HDTMA -B were increased from 0.1 to 2 g L-1, respectively, as can be seen in Figure 8a . 
These results clearly demonstrate the improved CR adsorption efficiency of alkyl ammonium 
surfactant -modified Bentonite . Therefore, it may be  stated that 1gL-1 of surfactant -modified 
Bentonite  was the optimum adsorbent dosage which represents the beginning of the saturation 
process, because higher amounts of adsorbent did not increase appreciably the CR adsorption. 
Figure 8b  suggests that the percentage removal of IC dye increased  from 14 to 94% when the 
HDTMA -B dosage augmented from 0.1 g L-1 to 0.75 g L-1, respectively. Beyond this dosage 
value, the adsorption efficiency dropped to 91 % and remained unchangeable. As for Na -B, low yields were obtained; the maximum was observed for a solid/solution ratio of 0.1 g L-1 (11.7 
%). Afterwards, this yield went down to 5.9 % when the ad sorbent dosage increased to 2 g L-1. 
The increase in the anionic dye removal indicates that the num ber of sorption sites on the 
adsorbent surface increased; this also suggests that more active binding sites become widely 
available as the adsorbent dosage grows .[45] These findings are similar to those previously 
reported by other authors [[46]] who indicated that at a higher adsorbent dosage, a portion of the 
solid surface remains uncovered due to the aggregation of the adsorbent particles.  
Insert Figure 8.  
 
Effect of initial concentration  
Figure 9  indicates that any increase in the initial concentration of the organic pollutant, within 
the range from 20 to 500 mg L-1, induces an increase in the adsorption  capacity from 19.7 to 
273.1 mg g-1 for CR dye and  from 14.2 to 240 mg g-1 for IC dye , respectively. The rise in the 
adsorption capacity as the initial concentration goes up can be explained by the growing driving 
force of the anionic dye to the active sites on the adsorbent. These findings are qualitatively in 
good agreement with those reported by Manjot et al. [47] and Gondzalez -Pradas et al. [48]. On 
the other hand, some histograms suggest that increasing the initial IC concentration ( Fig.9 b ) 
leads to higher adsorption efficiency to ultimately reach a maximum of 96% at  100 mg L-1; 
beyond this value, the removal efficiency gradually decreases. In addition, Figure 9a  clearl y 
shows that  the yield is highest (99%) for initial CR concentration s ranging between 20 and 100 
mg L-1. Beyond this concentration, the removal efficiency gradually decreases to reach a 
percentage yield of 54.5% at an initial concentration of 500 mg  L-1.

Adsorption isotherm study  The adsorption isotherms were used to understand the adsorption interaction and the design 
efficient adsorption systems. Most of the adsorption data show a good fit to the Langmuir and 
Freundlich models. The obtained experimental data are commonly well  fitted to the Langmuir 
(Equation  7) [49] and Freundlich (Equation 8) [50] models:  
1
𝑞𝑒=1
𝑞𝑚+1
𝑏𝑞𝑚1
𝐶𝑒    (7) 
𝑙𝑛𝑞𝑒=𝑙𝑛𝐾𝐹+1
𝑛 𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑒   (8) 
where the constants KF, n are for the Freundlich model and b for the Langmuir model; qm (mg 
g-1) is the maximum adsorption capacity for monolayer surface coverage.  
Insert Figure 10.  
The experimental data for the CR and IC adsorption isotherms are presented in Figure 10 . 
According to Giles classification ,[51] the HDTMA -hybrid  Bentonite  exhibits an L -type 
isotherm, corresponding to the formation of a dye monolayer on the surface of the adsorbent. 
The fitted curves of Freundlich  and Langmuir  models are depicted in Figure 11 . The parameters 
predicted by the two different models are summarized in Table 5 . In general, these parameters 
exhibited a good fit to the linear adjustment, but the correlation coefficient was better adjusted 
using the Langmuir model.  
Insert Figure 11.  
Insert Table 5.  
The favorability and feasibility of the adsorption process can be determined by the 
dimensionless equilibrium parameter or adsorption intensity of Hall (R L) in the analysis of data 
using the Langmuir isotherm. This parameter is given by the following equat ion [52]: 
𝑅𝐿=1
1+𝑏𝐶0    (9) 
The quantity RL indicates whether the isotherm is irreversible ( RL = 0), favorable (0 < RL < 1), 
linear ( RL = 1) or unfavorable ( RL > 1). Close examination of the graph obtained by plotting R L vs. C 0, at 20°C ( inset in Fig. 10 ), shows that the RL values are within the range from 0 and 1, 
and approached the value zero as C 0 increased, suggesting the favorable adsorption of CR and 
IC dyes onto HDTMA -modified Bentonite .  
The maximum adsorption capacities (q m) for the sorption of CR and IC onto HDTMA -modified 
Bentonite  were found equal to  292.4 and 289 mg g−1, respectively. Note that these values are  
significantly higher than those of other adsorbents . For example, this value was equal to  71.82 
and 55.5 mg g-1 for IC dye for chitosan [53] and mesoporous LDH nanoparticles [54], 
respectively. In the case of CR, Ghorai et al. [55] and Sagar et al. [56] reported the values of  
209.20 mg g-1 for Xanthan gum -graft -poly (acrylamide)/SiO 2 nanocomposite and 233.24 mg g-
1 for g -GG/SiO 2 nanocomposite, respectively.  
 
  Conclusion  
 
In this work, the hybrid -Bentonite  were prepared with the cationic surfactant 
hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide for the removal of diazo and indigo dyes from aqueous 
solutions. The intercalation of the organic molecule in the interlayer space of sodic Bentonite  
was confirmed either by FTIR, DTA –TG or XRD. The adsorption mechanism w as found to be 
strongly dependent on the amount of modifier, contact time, adsorbent dosage and initial 
anionic dye concentration. The adsorption capacities of the hybrid - Bentonite  for anionic dyes 
were much higher than that of sodic Bentonite . The remova l efficiency of CR was larger than 
that of IC on HDTMA -modified Bentonite  for the same modifier loadings. The experimental 
results show that Bentonite  functionalized with the surfactant HDTMA with a quantity 
corresponding to 100% of CEC has a high affinity  for anionic dyes. The pseudo -second -order 
model provided the best correlation of the experimental data. The results from the Weber and 
Morris model revealed that the intraparticle diffusion is not the only process controlling the CR 
and IC adsorption on N a-B and HDTMA -modified Bentonite . The equilibrium analysis showed 
that the Langmuir isotherm fitted better the adsorption data, and the maximum adsorption 
capacities were 292.4 mg g-1 for CR and 289.0 mg g-1 for IC, at 20 °C and  pH = 6.6. These 
findings indicate that the organic modification of Bentonite  with a cationic surfactant, like 
HDTMA, is an economical method for the enhancement of the adsorption properties.
