ABSTRACT  
Wastewater remediation by microalgae is an eco-frie ndly process with no secondary pollution as long as  the 
biomass produced is reused and allows efficient nut rient recycling. This study was undertaken to evalu ate 
the remediation of wastewater by the green alga Chlorella vulgaris  and the potential of these alga (biomass) 
to produce sustainable biofuel. The results shows t hat the cultivation of green alga Chlorella vulgaris  on 
wastewater has a positive effect on removal the maj or inorganic elements form the wastewater. Biodiese l 
can be produced from Chlorella vulgaris . The Chlorella vulgaris  can be used for remediation of wastewater 
and the producing biomass can be used as source of renewable energy.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 Algae are important bioremediation agents and are 
already being used by many wastewater facilities. T he 
potential for algae in wastewater remediation is ho wever 
much wider in scope than its current role. The rele ase of 
wastewater poses serious environmental challenges t o the 
receiving water bodies (De-Bashan and Bashan, 2010) . 
The major effect of releasing wastewater rich in or ganic 
compounds and inorganic chemicals such as phosphate s 
and nitrates is mainly eutrophication (Pizarro et al ., 2006; 
Munoz and Guieysse, 2008; Mulbry et al ., 2008;     
Godos et al ., 2009). This is a global problem that can be 
solved by the use of microalgae whereby the wastewa ter 
is used as feed for microalgal growth. The advantag e is 
that while the microalgae will be removing excess 
nutrients in the wastewater, there will be concomit ant 
accumulation of biomass for downstream processing 
(Chinnasamy et al ., 2010). The use of a wide range of microalgae such as Chlorella , Scenedesmus , Phormidium , 
Botryococcus , Chlamydomonas  and Spirulina  for treating 
wastewater has been reported and efficacy of this m ethod is 
promising (Olguin, 2003; Chinnasamy et al ., 2010; Kong et 
al ., 2010; Pittman et al ., 2010; Stephens et al ., 2010). 
 With global shortages of fossil fuels, especially oil and 
natural gas, a major focus has developed worldwide on 
renewable biofuel production. Algae, particularly g reen 
unicellular microalgae have been proposed for a lon g time 
as a potential renewable fuel source (Oswald and Go lueke, 
1960). Microalgae have been estimated to have highe r 
biomass productivity than plant crops in terms of l and area 
required for cultivation, are predicted to have low er cost per 
yield and have the potential to reduce green house emissions 
through the replacement of fossil fuels (Brune et al ., 2009; 
Chisti, 2008; Dismukes et al ., 2008). 
 The use of microalgae is desirable since they are able to 
serve a dual role of bioremediation of wastewater a s well as 
generating biomass for biofuel production with conc omitant Adel A. Fathi et al . / American Journal of Applied Sciences, 10 (2): 1 89-194, 2013

Mulbry et al ., 2008; Rawat et al ., 2011). In addition, 
wastewater remediation by microalgae is an eco-frie ndly 
process with no secondary pollution as long as the biomass 
produced is reused and allows efficient nutrient re cycling 
(Godos et al ., 2009). This study was undertaken with the 
aim to evaluate the remediation of waste water by t he green 
alga Chlorella vulgaris  and the potential of these alga 
(biomass) to produced sustainable biofuel.  
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
2.1. Wastewater Collection 
 The wastewaters used in the study, were collected ( in 
April 2010) from four different sources of wastewat er on 
Al-Hassa area, Saudi Arabia. 
2.2. Physico-Chemical Characteristics of 
Wastewaters  
 pH, conductivity, total dissolved salts and Dissolv ed 
oxygen of the wastewater were measured in location.  pH 
was measured using a pH meter (370 pH meter Jenway,  
UK), conductivity and total dissolved salts using a  
calibrated Conductivity Meter (470 Conductivity met er, 
Jenway, UK). Dissolved oxygen was measured accordin g 
to the Winkler method (Strickland and Parsons, 1972 ). 
Total alkalinity, phosphate-P, nitrate-N, chloride,  COD 
and major cations were measured according to Adams 
(1991). Sodium and potassium concentrations were 
determined photometrically by flame emission accord ing 
to Golterman and Clymo (1971). The results were 
calculated as mean values of triplicate measurement s 
made on each water sample from each of the four 
sampling stations.  
2.3. Organism and Culture Condition 
 Chlorella vulgaris  Beyerinck was isolated from Al-
Asfar Lake, Al-Hassa, Saudi Arabia. Isolation and 
purification were made by dilution and plating tech nique 
method. The alga was grown in 250 mL flasks contain ing 
100 mL Kuhl (1962) medium and incubated in an 
illuminated incubator (Precision, USA) at 22°C and 
irradiance at 150 µmol m −2 sec −1, provided by cool white 
fluorescent lamps set on 14:10 h photoperiod. All 
cultures were shaken twice daily to prevent cells f rom 
clumping. Sterile technique was used at all times.  
2.4. Determination of Algal Growth 
 Growth was measured in terms of cell number using 
a Haematocytometer, which was used for calculation of 
growth rate.  2.5. Treatment of Wastewater Samples  
 Wastewater was injected with Chlorella  sp. 
suspension (each flask contain two liters of wastew ater) 
with aeration and illumination for 7 days until odo rless and 
the culture became clear and green colour appeared.  The 
physic-chemical characteristics of wastewater befor e and 
after treatment with alga were determined as follow s in 
previously in case of the determination of physic-c hemical 
characteristics of wastewater. Nutrient removal rat es were 
calculated by dividing the difference between the f irst day 
and final day concentrations by the first day conce ntration, 
then multiplied by 100 and expressed as percentage.  
2.6. Biochemical Analysis 
 The anthrone method (Roe, 1955) was applied for 
total carbohydrate estimation using fresh material and 
glucose as a standard. Total lipids content was 
determined according to Moore and Stein (1948). Tot al 
protein was measured according to Lowry et al . (1951). 
2.7. Oil Extraction 
 Algae were ground with motor and pestle as much as 
possible. The ground algae were dried for 20 min at  80°C 
in a incubator for releasing water. Hexane and ethe r 
solution (20 and 20 mL) were mixed with the dried 
ground algae to extract oil. Then the mixture was k ept for 
24 h for settling. The extracted oil was evaporated  in 
vaccu to release hexane and ether solutions using r otary 
evaporator. Mixing of catalyst and methanol: 0.25 g  
NaOH was mixed with 24 mL methanol and stirred 
properly for 20 min. 
2.8. Biodiesel Production 
 The mixture of catalyst and methanol was poured int o 
the algal oil in a conical flask. The following rea ction and 
steps were followed National Biodiesel Board. 
2.9. Transesterification  
 The reaction process is called transesterification.  The 
conical flask containing solution was shaken for 3 h by 
electric shaker at 300 rpm. After shaking the solut ion was 
kept for 16 h to settle the biodiesel and sediment layers 
clearly ( Fig. 1 ).

 Science Publications  AJAS 2.10. Separation of Biodiesel 
 The biodiesel was separated from sedimentation by 
flask separator carefully. Quantity sedimeant (glyc erine) 
was measured. Biodiesel was washed by 5% water unti l it 
was become clean. Biodiesel was dried by using drye r 
and finally kept under the running fan for 12 h. Bi odiesel 
production was measured by using measuring cylinder , 
pH was measured and stored for analysis. 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 The chemical compositions of the four wastewaters 
are listed in Table 1 . The data show that the pH values of 
wastewater samples I and II were in the acidic side  
whereas in samples III and IV in alkaline side. Sam ples 
III and IV were found to be characterized by highes t total 
dissolved salts in comparison to other samples. It is 
worthy to mention that the nitrate and phosphate 
concentrations on sample IV were found to be high t han 
other samples. The data also reported that the of d ivalent 
(calcium and magnesium) and monovalent cations 
(sodium and potassium) were relatively high at all 
samples, irrespective of some minor fluctuations. C OD 
was taken in the present study as a measure of the 
oxygenated state and additionally the amount of 
organic\matter in water as well. The data of this s tudy 
show that COD tended to be higher in samples III an d IV 
(26.10 and 22.8 mg L −1, respectively). 
 Algae represent the best biological treatment for 
wastewater because they increase oxygen content of 
waters via  photosynthesis. In this study, waste water was 
injected with an active green alga Chlorella vulgaris 
culture. After the incubation period the pH value w as 
changed to the alkaline side. This general tendency  to the 
alkaline side may be due to the increased photosynt hetic 
activity of planktonic algae, or to the chemicals n ature of 
water (Fathi et al ., 2001).  
 Chlorella vulgaris  growth in terms of cell number in 
the four wastewaters sample was plotted in Fig. 2 . No lag 
phases were observed in all of the four curves, ind icating 
that this wild-isolated algae Chlorella  sp. could adapt 
well in all of the wastewater samples. Similar grow th 
patterns, with exponential phases in the first 3 da ys 
followed by stationary phases in the next 6 days we re 
present for all wastewaters, except the sample no. IV, in 
which the exponential phase lasted 1 day more befor e 
entering into a stationary phase. Moreover, it can be 
found that the algal growth was significantly enhan ced in 
the sample no. IV. It could be due to its much high er 
levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and COD than the oth er three wastewaters ( Table 1 ). Therefore, the results show 
that the sample no. IV is the best media for algal growth.  
 The data of Table 2  preformed that the cultivation of 
algae removed almost the measured parameters specia lly 
the major inorganic nutrient (phosphate and nitrate ). On 
the other hand, oxygen content, alkalinity and COD were 
found to increased in compare to other tested param eters. 
Dissolved oxygen is an important parameter for 
identification of different water masses. The relat ively 
high concentrations of dissolved oxygen recorded af ter 
algal treatment could be mainly attributed to 
photosynthetic activity of algae (Fathi et al ., 2001). 
However, the highest concentrations of alkalinity m ay be 
due to the bacterial decomposition of organic subst rates 
coming with the re-use drainage water receiving by this 
site (Abdel-Satar and Elewa, 2001). When the organi c 
substrate is not available, autotrophic growth uses  CO 2 as 
the carbon source, excreting small molecular organi c 
substances such as glycolic acid to the environment  as a 
product of photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle      
(Wang et al ., 2010) which is the reason why COD in 
effluent increased after algal cultivation. General ly the data 
shows that the green alga Chlorella vulgaris  can be for 
removed the major inorganic elements form the waste water. 
 In recent years, biofuel production from algae has  
attracted the most attention among other possible 
products. The recent soaring and crashing of oil pr ices 
and diminishing world oil reserves, coupled with 
enhanced greenhouse gases and the predicted threat of 
climate change, have generated renewed interest in using 
algae as alternative and renewable feedstock for en ergy 
production (Ramachandra et al ., 2009). Algae are of 
great interest in the production of biofuels due to  the fact 
that a number of species of freshwater and marine a lgae 
contain large amounts of high quality polyunsaturat ed 
fatty acids which can be produced for aquaculture 
operations. Algae can grow heterotrophically on che ap 
organic substrates, without light and under well-
controlled cultivation conditions. The characterist ics of 
algal oil are similar to those of fish and vegetabl e oils and 
can thus be considered as potential substitutes for  the 
product of fossil oil (Ramachandra et al ., 2009). 
 The data of Table 3  performed the chemical 
composition of tested alga. The data show that Chlorella 
vulgaris  contain highest amount of protein and lipids in 
compared to the other tested biochemical parameters . 
Microalgae which include algal strains, diatoms and  
cyanobacteria have been found to contain high level s of 
lipids-over 30%. Due to the high lipid content, the se 
microalgal strains are of great interest in the sea rch for 
sustainable sources for the production of biodiesel  
(Hossain and Salleh, 2008).  Adel A. Fathi et al . / American Journal of Applied Sciences, 10 (2): 1 89-194, 2013

 Regarding to the biodiesel production from the 
tested alga the data of this investigation performe d that 
the extracted oil seemed to be higher in compare to  the 
other investigation (Ramachandra et al ., 2009; Hossain 
and Salleh, 2008), Table 4 . It seems biodiesel can be 
produced from macro algae though it contains lower 
lipid content than micro algae (Sharif et al ., 2008).

grown in waste water 
 
On other hand, sediment were also higher in Chlorella 
vulgaris  than its recorded on other algal species 
(Ramachandra et al ., 2009; Sharif and Salleh, 2008; 
Hossain and Salleh, 2008). Sharif et al . (2008) reported 
that algal oil and biodiesel (ester) production was  higher 
in Oedogonium  than Spirogyra  sp. However, biomass 
(after oil extraction) was higher in Spirogyra  than 
Oedogonium  sp. 
 Biodiesel can be produced from macro algae because  
of lipid contents. Sijtsma and Swaaf (2004) stated that 
Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) was a polyunsaturated 
fatty acid composed of 22 carbon atoms and six doub le 
bonds that belonged to the socalled w-3 group. Vinc ecate 
(2006) suggested that seaweeds contain about 5.5% o il. 
Heterotrophic growth of certain marine eukaryotes, such 
as the microalgae, is enhanced in this medium. The 
samples harvested from these examples produce lipid  
fractions containing Omega-3 fatty acids. After 
extraction and esterification to form the methyl es ters, 
gas chromatographic analyses show that the w-3 fatt y 
acids may constitute as much as 10-50% of the total  fatty 
acid fraction. Spolaore et al . (2006) evaluated that Adel A. Fathi et al . / American Journal of Applied Sciences, 10 (2): 1 89-194, 2013

 Science Publications  AJAS microalgae can provide several different types of 
renewable biofuels. Many researchers reported that 
biodiesel was derived from microalgal oil (Thomas, 
2006; Sharif et al ., 2008). Our results indicate that 
biodiesel can be produced from Chlorella vulgaris . In 
this way algae can be used as renewable energy. 
4. CONCLUSION 
 Microalgal cultures offer an interesting alternati ve 
for waste water treatment because they provide a te rtiary 
biotreatment coupled with the production of potenti ally 
valuable biomass, which can be used for several 
purposes. Microalgae have the potential to generate  
significant quantities of biomass and oil suitable for 
conversion to biodiesel.  This study was undertaken  to 
evaluate the remediation of wastewater by the green  alga 
Chlorella vulgaris  and the potential of these alga (biomass) 
to produce sustainable biofuel. The data indicted t hat 
cultivation of green alga Chlorella vulgaris on was tewater 
has a positive effect on removal the major inorgani c 
elements form the wastewater. Biodiesel can be prod uced 
from Chlorella vulgaris. The Chlorella vulgaris  can be 
used for remediation of wastewater and the producin g 
biomass can be used as source of renewable energy.
