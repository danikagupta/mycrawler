Abstract:  Effluent from textile industries were treated with e nzyme from white rot fungi isolated from outskirts of M umbai and identified as Polyporus rubidus 
in our laboratory. Decolorisation of 4 Reactive dyes c ommonly found in the effluents such as Reactive bue , Reactive orange, Ramazol black and Congo red 
was examined by treatment with enzyme from Polyporus ru bidus. Treatment of effluent was done in a laborator y scale bioreactor constructed with laccase 
immobilized Na-alginate beads. Greater than 80% of d yes were degraded within 5  days under stationary in cubation conditions. The enzyme had a maxmimum 
activity of 17.1U after 3 days and was found to be s ecreted extracellularly by Polyporus rubidus. In this study the Polyporus rubidus has been reported for 
the first time to have laccase activity offering a promising possibility to develop an easy and cost ef fective method for degradation of dangerous dyes.

Introduction 
Wastewater from textile industries pose a threat to  the 
environment as large amount of chemically different  dyes are used 
for various industrial applications such as textile  dyeing and a 
significant proportion of these dyes enter the envi ronment via 
wastewater. The presence of even very low concentra tions of dyes 
in effluent is highly visible and degradation produ cts of these textile 
dyes are often carcinogenic (Kim et al. , 2003). Further, the adsorption 
of light by these textile dyes creates problems for  photosynthetic 
aquatic plants and algae (Singh and Singh, 2006). E arlier studies 
have shown that many reactive dyes are not degraded  in ordinary 
aerobic sewage treatment processes and that they ca n be discharged 
unaffected from the treatment plant (Carliel et al., 1996; Panswad 
and Luangdilok, 2000). These reactive dyes are high ly water-soluble 
polyaromatic molecules, which means they do not ads orb to solids 
and are prevalent in high concentration in the effl uents (Ganesh et 
al., 1994). 
Currently, textile effluents are treated by physico -chemical 
methods that are often quite expensive. In addition  these methods do 
not generally degrade the pollutant, thereby causin g an accumulation 
of the dye as sludge creating a disposal problem. C urrently available 
technologies have been reviewed by Robinson  (Robinson et al. ,
2001), and therefore special attention is given to biological processes 
because they are cost effective and environmentally  friendly . Removing 
dyes in aerobic conditions is mainly achieved by ad sorbing the dyes 
on bacteria, rather than oxidation. Some anaerobic textile wastewater 
treatment methods have been developed at a laborato ry scale and 
have shown to remove color efficiently (Kapdan et al., 2000) but the 
anaerobic treatment of some azo dyes may result in the formation of 
toxic aromatic amines. Further more, there may be a  risk of reverse 
colorization when anaerobic degradation products ar e exposed to 
oxygen (Brown and De Vito, 1993; Knapp and Newby, 1 995). While studying degradation of organic molecules, te xtile dyes 
may be regarded as a poorly chosen example, due to their resistance 
to external factors. Many dyes are also resistant t o UV light and 
therefore constitute a challenging group of chemica ls while designing 
degradation processes. A key feature in the degrada tion processes, 
at least in the aerobic ones, involves generation o f activated oxygen 
forms that can carryout the initial attack on the s table structure of the 
dye (Hu, 2001; Wong  and Yuen, 1996). 
A great number of white rot fungi have been shown t o 
excrete extra cellular enzymes like lignin peroxida se, mn- 
peroxidase and laccase (Hatakka, 1994). These enzym es 
catalyse the formation of activated oxygen so that the process of 
attack on the stable structure of dyes can be initi ated. The lack of 
selectivity of these enzymes towards the aromatic c ompounds 
attacked is the basis for using white rot fungi for  treating textile 
dyes. 
Many white rot fungi e.g.  Phanerachaete chrysosporium, 
Ganoderma sp WR.1,  Trametes trogii, Irpex lacteus, Dichomitus 
squalens, Pycnoporus strains etc.  have been intensively studied 
in connection with their ligninolytic enzyme produc tion and their 
decolorisation ability (Borchert and Libra, 2001; R evankar and 
Lele, 2007; Mechichi et al., 2006; Maxima and Costa-Ferreira, 
2004; Susla et al., 2007; Singh et al.,  2007; Demir et al., 2007). 
White rot fungi like Phanerachaete chrysosporium   has also been 
reported to treate Vinasses a highly hazardous envi ronmental 
pollutant (Potentini and Rodriguez-Malaver, 2006). 
In this study, the potential of white rot fungi, Polyporus rubidus 
to produce laccase enzyme and its capacity to decol orize higher 
concentration of several dyes such as Reactive blue , Reactive 
orange, Ramazol black and Congo red  along with effluents from 
textile units has been investigated. Journal of Environmental Biology   /circleshadowdwnNovember, 2008 /circleshadowdwnPoonam Dayaram and Debjani Dasgupta 
Materials and Methods 
Micro-organism: The fungus used in this study was   isolated from 
the suburbs of Mumbai, India. It was taxonomically identified as 
Polyporus rubidus (Bakshi, 1971). 
Chemicals: Synthetic dyes were obtained from Raymonds Textile 
company and other chemicals used in fungal cultures , enzyme assays 
including 2, 6, dimethoxyphenol were purchased from  Sigma. 
Storage of organism: The fungus was stored on Potato Dextrose 
agar plate. New plates were inoculated once a month  to ensure 
viability of the isolates. 
Production of enzymes: The medium for cultivation of Polyporus 
rubidus  contained 4.5% (wt/vol) wheat bran, 1.5% yeast ext ract, 
1% glucose, 0.25% NH 4Cl, 0.05% thiamine dichloride, 0.2% 
KH 2PO 4, MgSO 4.7H 2O, 0.01% CaCl 2 and 0.05%KCl. Tap water 
was used for preparation of the medium, and the pH was adjusted to 
5.5 by using NaOH or HCl. Incubation was carried ou t at 28 + 2oC
on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) in cotton – plugged 25 0 ml Erlenmeyer 
flask containing 100 ml of media. Flasks were inocu lated with 1cm 
square agar pieces from an actively growing fungus on potato 
dextrose agar (PDA). Cultures were harvested after 7 days, filtered 
and clarified by centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 20  min to remove the 
mycelia, and the enzyme activity assayed for furthe r purification. 
Enzyme assay: Laccase activity was determined using 2, 6, 
dimethoxyphenol (DMP) as a substrate as described b efore. The reaction mixture contained1 mM DMP in 50 mM sodium malonate 
(pH 4.5). The formation of 2, 2’ 6, 6’ dimethoxyphe noquinone 
(orange /brown color) at 30 oC was followed spectrophotometrically 
at 468 nm wavelength, and laccase activity was calc ulated from the 
molar extinction co-efficient (E) of 49.6 mM cm -1  (de Jong et al., 
1992). 
Microbial treatment of textile dyes and dyeing effl uents: 
Polyporus rubidus was cultivated as described earlier and the 
mycelium was collected by filtration under aseptic conditions and 
washed thrice with 500 ml of sterilized D/W. A samp le of 1 g (wet 
weight) of mycelium was incubated for 8 days with d ifferent dyes 
such as Reactive blue, Ramazol black, Reactive oran ge and Congo 
red with concentration ranging from 100 mgl -1  to 1000 mgl -1 . Sterile 
controls without inoculum were also maintained unde r the same 
conditions. Growth of the fungus was inhibited with  antibiotics to 
determine whether the decolorisation was due to met abolic activity of 
the organism or due to other phenomena. After 8 day s, all incubation 
mixtures were filtered using 0.45 µm pore size filt er paper. The 
decolorization efficiency was determined spectropho tometrically at 
the absorption maximum of each dye. Adsorption of d yes to the 
mycelium was determined by solubilization of the dy es with water. 
Adsorbed dye was washed off the mycelium twice with  20 ml of 
water. 
Enzymatic treatment of textile dyes in lab bioreact or: Eight 
cylindrical reactors with conical bottoms were used  for continuous 
experiments with laccase from Polyporus rubidus  (Fig. 1). Four of 
the reactors were used to study decolorization  of Reactive blue, 
Ramazol black, Reactive orange and Congo red, while  the other 
four were used for studying decolorisation of  dyes  in real textile 
wastewater from 4 textile units in the state of Mah arashtra, India. The 
reactors had a liquid volume of 1 liter. They were autoclaved and 
then filled with laccase immobilized sodium alginat e beads (Park et 
al., 2006). Bioreactors were kept at Room temperature  (28+ 2oC) 
and dye solutions at different concentration were a dded to these 
bioreactors. Aliquots were collected after 24 hr an d percentage color 
remaining was determined spectrophotometrically for  the subsequent 
period of 5 days. The pH of the textile wastewater was set between 
4-7, the optimal pH range for the fungal enzymes. U ntreated effluents 
were also subjected to chemical analysis before pou ring in bioreactor. 
The experiments were continued for 5 days. All reac tor experiments 
were performed at room temperature (28 + 2oC). 
Results and Discussion 
The ability of white rot fungi to decolorize variou s synthetic 
textile dyes has been extensively studied (Panswad and 
Luangdilok,2000; Libra  et al., 2003; Binz and Canevascini,1996; 
Ramsay et al., 2005). During the past decade, white rot fungi 
basidiomycetes were studied in relation to their ab ility to degrade 
recalcitrant organo-pollutants (Field et al., 1993; Vyas et al., 1994; 
Demir, 2004). These studies were done in parallel w ith those on a 
complex enzymic system that allows these fungi to d egrade lignin 
(Barr and Aust, 1994; Costa et al., 1994). In particular, the relatively 
non-specific nature of the lignolytic phenoloxidase s makes these

fungi useful for various potential applications (Er iksson et al., 1990; 
Duarte and Costa –Ferreira, 1994)  Phanerachaete chrysosporium ,
a much-studied white rot fungus, is known to be a g ood degrader of 
azo dyes (Paszczynski et al., 1991). Among the other fungi studied 
are Trametes versicolor, Pleurotus sp ,  Bjerkandera sp , Ischnoderma 
resinosum, Irpex lactus and  Pycnoporus cinnabarinus which have 
also been successfully shown to decolorise commerci al dyes such 
as Reactive black 5, Reactive blue 19, Reactive yel low etc  (Roy- 
Arcand and Archibald,1991; Shin et al ., 1997; Swamy and Ramsay,1999; Eichlerova et al., 2005; Maxima and Costa-Ferreira, 
2004). Although in many of these studies model mono azo compounds 
were used, a wealth of information is presently ava ilable that inidicates 
the versatility of fungi. However, such an approach  involving whole 
fungal cultures suffers from two major technical dr awbacks. Firstly, 
the process is slow, typically requiring several da ys and secondly, 
the sludge volume increases due to the generation o f biomass. 
Enzymes represent an attractive option for dye bio-
transformation for numerous reasons (Karan and Nice ll, 1997). This 
strategy has been used in the treatment of colorant s in wastewater 
from pulp and paper mills (Hakulinen, 1988; Bajpai and Bajpai,1994), 
which paved the way for applications for textile mi ll effluents, 
encouraging the search for new promising white rot fungi. 
Among numerous white rot fungi screened earlier for
degradation of dyes, the potential of  Polyporus rubidus to decolorize 
textile dyes has not been studied so far. The aim o f this study therefore 
was to investigate the novel ability of this rarely  studied white rot fungi 
Polyporus rubidus to decolorize industrially important synthetic dyes . 
Polyporus rubidus  was capable of decolorizing four commercially 
used dyes and untreated textile effluents collected  from four textile Table - 1: Determination of the various parameters of the untreate d effluent

Incubation period in days 833 Journal of Environmental Biology   /circleshadowdwnNovember, 2008 /circleshadowdwnunits near Mumbai, in the state of Maharashtra, Ind ia. Synthetic dyes 
such as Reactive blue, Reactive orange, Ramazol bla ck and Congo 
red were found to be decolorized by an extra cellul ar enzyme and 
also mycelium of Polyporus rubidus .
During our investigation it was observed that lacca se 
appeared to constitute the major phenoloxidase acti vity in the culture 
fluid, when Polyporus rubidus was grown in specially designed 
wheat bran broth in our laboratory. Growth and enzy me production 
in shake flasks were superior to those found in sta nding cultures, 
and shaking conditions were therefore chosen for ro utine cultivation. 
Laccase activity in the culture fluid was detectabl e after 48 hr and 
reached a maximum of 17.1U/ml when assayed with 2,6
Dimethoxyphenol. Partially purified   extracellular  laccase enzyme 
was immobilized in bio-reactor as explained earlier . 
Standard synthetic dyes such as Reactive blue with varying 
concentration from 1000 mgl -1  to 100 mgl -1  were introduced in the 
bio-reactor and the percentage color remaining moni tored for five 
days as shown in (Fig. 2). It was observed that as the period of 
incubation increased the percentage color remaining  decreased 
from an initial 100% color   on the day of inoculat ion to 63% color on 
day one, 46% color on day three, 39% color on day f ive for 1000 
mgl -1  concentration of dye.  It was also found that for 400 mgl -1 
concentration of dye 20% color remained after five days of incubation. 
However, the rate of decolorisation was significant ly enhanced when 
the initial concentration of the dye taken was redu ced. In the case of 
100 mgl -1 concentration of Reactive blue 90% decolorisation o f the 
dye was achieved after five days of incubation. Thi s indicated the 
high efficiency of enzyme in the bioreactor. Myceli um was found to 
be less efficient in decolorizing the dye as compar ed to immobilized 
enzyme (Fig. 6). Vanhullel et al. (2007) have observed that Reactive 
blue 19 causes an increase in laccase activity in P ycnoporus strain 7 
culture and that laccase catalyses the oxidation of  Reactive blue 19 
dye. A full decolorisation of the dye was not achie ved with the enzyme 
alone, but required other factors present in the wh ole cell. 
The percentage color remaining after five days was also 
monitored for Reactive orange at different concentr ations as shown in Fig. 3. For 1000 mgl -1  of Reactive orange, 40% color remained 
after five days incubation, as was also seen in the  case of Reactive 
blue. However, 92% decolorisation was obtained for 100 mgl -1  of 
this dye. Baldman and Snajdr (2006), have shown tha t strain X3 
isolated from soil could decolorize Reactive orange  16, only after 28 
days of incubation, whereas only 15-21% decolorisat ion was 
obtained with C. dryophila, S.rugosoannulate  and T. versicolor. 
Similarly two other dyes namely Ramazol black and C ongo 
red were introduced at different concentrations in the bioreactor and 
percentage color remaining was monitored for five d ays as shown in 
Fig. (4, 5). Ramazol black at 1000 mgl -1  showed 26% color remaining 
on day 5 of incubation, whereas for 100 mgl -1  complete decolorisation 
of both the dyes was observed within 3 days of incu bation. The 
commercial dyes were also subjected to decolorisati on by mycelia 
as mentioned in the methods. Mycelia were found to be far less 
efficient than immobilized enzyme in bioreactor in the decolorisation 
process (Fig. 6). Murugesan et al. (2007), found that crude laccase 
25U/ml decolorized Ramazol black-5 (50 mgl -1 ) by 62%. However, 
our studies have shown that Ramazol black at 100 mg l -1   was 
completely decolorized within 3 days and our proces s also did not 
require any mediator. A recent work by Boer et al. (2004), have 
shown complete decolorisation of Congo red after 18  days of 
incubation by using solid state culture. 
Further studies were performed under similar experi mental 
conditions with 4 untreated effluent samples having  various 
parameters as shown in Table (1). The effluents sam ples were 
neutralized before introducing in the bioreactor an d percentage 
decolorisation was monitored continuously over a pe riod of 8 days 
as shown in Fig. 7. It was observed that effluent s ample 1 and 3 
showed 100% decolorisation within four days where a s 25% color 
remained on treatment with mycelia. Sample 2 and 4 showed 20% 
and 30% color remaining after five days of incubati on. 72% and 60% 
decolorisation was observed on treatment with mycel ia. The 
immobilized enzyme in bioreactor is far more effici ent then mycelia in 
the decolorisation process. The enzyme was able to decolorize 
Congo red and Ramazol black most efficiently follow ed by Reactive 
blue and Reactive orange dyes. 020 40 60 80 100 120

Pleurotus ostreatus,  and  Ischnoderma resinosum,  have already 
shown the use of  redox mediator such as violuric a cid and 
hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) to decolorise recalcitra nt dyes such as 
C.I Acid red 97, Acid green 26, Reactive black 5, R eactive red 22 
and Reactive yellow 15 (Couto and Sanroman, 2007; E ichlerova et 
al., 2005). 
From our study it was observed that ready availabil ity of 
laccase from Polyporus rubidus  and its robust characteristics helps 
to overcome the barriers for wastewater treatment. Our results 
suggested that laccase from Polyporus rubidus  could decolorise 
synthetic dyes in a broad range of concentration wi thout the need for 
redox mediators, provided that these dyes are water -soluble. It was 
also observed that immobilized enzymes tend to have  higher activity 
and are more resilient to environmental perturbatio ns such as pH or 
exposure to toxic chemical concentrations than susp ension cultures. 
The enzyme from Polyporus rubidus  was also found to be effective 
in removing color from untreated effluents. Enzymes  from white rot 
fungi, Phlebia tremellos a took 14 days (Kirby et al., 2000), Trametes 
versicolor  took 6 days, B. adusta  took 9 days for decolorisation of 
textile effluents (Robinson et al., 2001). This study showed white rot 
fungi, Polyporus rubidus  is far more efficient for decolorizing a range 
of industrially important textile dyes and real was tewater from such 
industries. 
Further studies are in progress for the characteriz ation and 
purification of   laccase enzyme from this isolate.  Future work with this 
isolate would concentrate upon finding the breadth of pollutants that 
can be further exploited to develop a cost effectiv e bioremediation 
process.
