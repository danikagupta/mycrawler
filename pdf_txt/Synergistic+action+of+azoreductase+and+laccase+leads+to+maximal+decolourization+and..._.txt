In this work, an environment-friendly enzymatic strategy was developed for the
valorisation of dye-containing wastewaters. We set up biocatalytic processes for the
conversion of azo dyes representative of the main classes used in the textile industry
into valuable aromatic compounds: aromatic amines, phenoxazinones, phenazines,
and naphthoquinones. First, puriÔ¨Åed preparations of PpAzoR azoreductase efÔ¨Åciently
reduced mordant, acid, reactive, and direct azo dyes into aromatic amines, and
CotA-laccase oxidised these compounds into phenazines, phenoxazinones, and
naphthoquinones. Second, whole cells containing the overproduced enzymes were
utilised in the two-step enzymatic conversion of the model mordant black 9 dye
into sodium 2-amino-3-oxo-3 H-phenoxazine-8-sulphonate, allowing to overcome the
drawbacks associated with the use of expensive puriÔ¨Åed enzymes, co-factors, or
exquisite reaction conditions. Third, cells immobilised in sodium alginate allowed
recycling the biocatalysts and achieving very good to excellent Ô¨Ånal phenoxazine product
yields (up to 80%) in water and with less impurities in the Ô¨Ånal reaction mixtures. Finally,
one-pot systems using recycled immobilised cells co-producing both enzymes resulted
in the highest phenoxazinone yields (90%) through the sequential use of static and
stirring conditions, controlling the oxygenation of reaction mixtures and the successive
activity of azoreductase (anaerobic) and laccase (aerobic).

INTRODUCTION
More than 100,000 diÔ¨Äerent recalcitrant synthetic dyes are currently used in the textile, food,
paper, printing, leather, and cosmetics industries (Carmen and Daniela, 2012). It is estimated that
around 105tonnes of dyes and dyestuÔ¨Ä are released into the environment in the 200 billion litres
of wastewaters, which result annually from the aforementioned industrial activities (Kant, 2012).
Wastewaters containing dyes, from which 70% are azo dyes with one or more azo bonds (R 1‚ÄìN-
N‚ÄìR 2), in addition to aesthetic problems, represent a liability since many azo dyes as well as their
breakdown products are toxic and potentially mutagenic to living organisms (Rawat et al., 2016;
Hassaan and Nemr, 2017).
The vast majority of dye-containing wastewater treatments rely on the use of physico-
chemical methods, including precipitation, coagulation, and Ô¨Åltration (Pereira and Alves, 2012;
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 672436fbioe-09-672436 June 9, 2021 Time: 17:42 # 2
Fernandes et al. Enzymatic Conversion of Azo Dyes
Vikrant et al., 2018). In spite of their recognised eÔ¨Éciency in
decolourisation processes, they rely on the use of hazardous
additives, produce large amounts of sludge, and are frequently
not skilful for full wastewater detoxiÔ¨Åcation. Biological treatment
technologies are eco-friendly and cost-eÔ¨Äective alternatives (Rai
et al., 2005; Saratale et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2013). In particular,
enzymatic processes are particularly attractive considering that
biological decolourisation is assigned to the action of a limited
number of enzymes: azoreductases, laccases, and peroxidases
(Rodriguez-Couto, 2009; Mendes et al., 2015; Singh et al.,
2015). Enzymatic processes are sustainable, eco-friendly, and
particularly attractive considering their speciÔ¨Åcity for dye
degradation while keeping intact valuable dyeing additives or
Ô¨Åbres that can potentially be re-used, resulting in signiÔ¨Åcant
reductions in water consumption. At present, treatment of dye-
containing wastewaters is mostly focused in their remediation;
however, the implementation of appropriate approaches has
potential to couple the degradation of dyes to their conversion
into valuable chemicals. This is in line with the principles of
circular economy emphasising the urgency to design out waste
and pollution, keep products, and materials in use and regenerate
natural systems (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017; Lange et al., 2021).
In a previous work, we showed that the coupled action of
PpAzoR azoreductase from Pseudomonas putida MET94 and
CotA-laccase from Bacillus subtilis resulted in the decolourisation
as well as in the detoxiÔ¨Åcation of a large array of structurally
diverse azo dyes and model wastewaters (Mendes et al., 2011a).
Herein, we report the coupled action of these enzymes in
the valorisation of azo dyes commonly present in wastewaters.
Azoreductases are highly eÔ¨Äective in decolourising azo dyes
yielding aromatic amines, building blocks in diÔ¨Äerent industries,
including agrochemical, Ô¨Åne chemical, and pharmaceutical.
CotA-laccase oxidises a wide range of aromatic amines
with diÔ¨Äerent substitution patterns ( ortho -phenylenediamines,
substituted para -phenylenediamines, and ortho -amino-phenols,
among others) that are precursors of dimeric and trimeric dyes
as well as of substituted heterocyclic frameworks (phenazine,
phenoxazinone, and carbazole derivatives), multifunctional and
versatile building blocks widely distributed in a vast array of
biologically active compounds (Martins et al., 2020). The Ô¨Åve dyes
used in this study, namely, mordant black 9 (MB9), mordant
black 3 (MB3), acid red 266 (AR266), reactive yellow 145
(RY145), and direct red 80 (DR80), were chosen as they represent
the most common classes of azo dyes used in the textile industry,
for example, in cotton and wool-dyeing processes (Carmen
and Daniela, 2012), and also because we had previous results
showing that the sequential treatment with PpAzoR and CotA-
laccase results in maximal decolourisation and detoxiÔ¨Åcation
levels (Mendes et al., 2011a).
In this work, we have identiÔ¨Åed, using NMR spectroscopy,
the aromatic amines resulting from azo dye degradation
by the PpAzoR azoreductase, and the heterocyclic products
(phenazines, phenoxazinones, and naphthoquinones) that
resulted from the oxidation of these aromatic amines with CotA-
laccase. We have optimised using the MB9 azo dye, two-step and
one-pot bioprocesses using free and immobilised Escherichia coli
cells that have overproduced the enzymes of interest, resultingin reactions performed in water and at mild conditions of
temperature, which led to 90% phenoxazine conversion yields.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
All chemicals and solvents were obtained from commercial
suppliers and were used without further puriÔ¨Åcation. The dyes
used in this study were as follows: MB9 ( lmax = 550 nm;
purity of 48%), MB3 ( lmax = 550 nm; purity of 40%), AR266
(lmax= 470 nm; purity of 30%), RY145 ( lmax= 420 nm; purity
of 50%), and DR80 ( lmax = 530 nm; purity of 50%). MB9 was
purchased from DyStar Textilfarben (Frankfurt, Germany) and
MB3 from Honeywell Fluka (Bucharest, Romania); and AR266,
RY145, and DR80 were purchased from Town End (Leeds,
United Kingdom).
Bacterial Strains and Plasmids
Escherichia coli strain DH5 a(Novagen, Madison, WI,
United States) was used for routine propagation and
ampliÔ¨Åcation of plasmid constructs; and E. coli Tuner (DE3,
Novagen), E. coli KRX (Promega, Madison, WI, United States),
and E. coli BL21 star (DE3, Novagen) were tested as host
of plasmids for gene expression. Three plasmids were used:
pLOM10, coding for CotA-laccase from B. subtilis (Martins et al.,
2002); pVB-8, coding for the evolved variant 2A1-Y179H of
P. putida MET94 PpAzoR (Brissos et al., 2014); and pAIF-2, a
pET-Duet-1 construct, coding for both wild-type PpAzoR and
CotA-laccase genes (Mendes et al., 2011a).
Preparation of PuriÔ¨Åed Enzymes and
Whole-Cell Systems
Escherichia coli recombinant cells overproducing the enzymes
of interest were cultivated in Luria‚ÄìBertani (LB) media
supplemented with 100 mg ml 1of ampicillin following
previously described procedures (Durao et al., 2008; Mendes
et al., 2011b). The cells were harvested by centrifugation
(8,000g, 10 min, 4C) and washed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl.
(i) For reactions using puriÔ¨Åed enzymes, cells were
disrupted using a French press, cell debris were
removed by centrifugation (18,000 g, 2 h, 4C),
and enzymes were puriÔ¨Åed from supernatants using
well-established chromatographic methods (Bento et al.,
2005; Mendes et al., 2011b). CotA-laccase activity was
determined at 37C using 0.1 mM of ABTS as substrate
(+420= 36,000 M 1cm 1) in 0.1 M of sodium acetate
buÔ¨Äer, pH 4.3. The activity of PpAzoR azoreductase was
measured in 0.1 M of sodium phosphate buÔ¨Äer, pH 7,
using 0.1 mM of anthraquinone-2-sulphonate (AQS)
and 0.25 mM of b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH; +340= 6,200 M 1cm 1) at 42C.
One unit (U) of enzymatic activity was deÔ¨Åned as the
amount of enzyme required to convert 1 mmol of substrate
per min. Aliquots of puriÔ¨Åed enzymes were stored at ‚Äì20C
prior to use. The protein concentration was determined

Fernandes et al. Enzymatic Conversion of Azo Dyes
using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin
as the standard.
(ii) For reactions with free and immobilised whole cells,
E. coli cells were suspended in distilled water, the optical
density was measured at 600 nm (OD 600), aliquots of cell
suspensions containing around 300-mg dry cell weight
(DCW) were centrifuged, and pellets stored at ‚Äì20C
prior to use. A calibration curve of OD 600versus DCW
(mg ml 1) after drying cell suspensions (at diÔ¨Äerent
OD 600) at 100C until no variation in weight was
previously performed. Immobilisation was performed after
suspending cell pellets (300- or 600-mg DCW) in 2 ml
of a 2% sodium alginate solution, followed by dropwise
addition to a 0.15 M of CaCl 2solution under continuous
stirring. The spheres were left to solidify for 90 min,
then were washed with distilled water, and stored at
4C until use.
Two-Step Enzymatic Bioprocess Using
Enzymes
The Ô¨Årst step of bioconversion of dyes using puriÔ¨Åed PpAzoR
azoreductase was performed in serum bottles (20 ml) containing
2 mM of b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen
(NADH) and 0.8‚Äì1.0 mM of azo dyes (MB9, MB3, AR266,
RY145, and DR80) in 0.1 M of sodium phosphate buÔ¨Äer, pH
7, made anaerobic by nitrogen bubbling followed by sealing
with rubber stoppers. The 10-ml mixtures were incubated at
30C, and reactions were started by adding 5 U ml 1of an
anoxic preparation of puriÔ¨Åed enzyme. Decolourisation was
monitored at the maximum wavelength of each dye. When
decolourisation was85%, reaction mixtures were transferred to
a 50-ml Erlenmeyer Ô¨Çask, 1 U ml 1of CotA-laccase was added,
and these were shaken at 180 rpm at 37C for 24 h.
Two-Step Enzymatic Bioprocess Using
Free and Immobilised Whole Cells
The Ô¨Årst PpAzoR catalysed step was performed in 5 ml of water
or 20 mM of sodium phosphate buÔ¨Äer (pH 7) at 30C in the
presence of free or immobilised cells (60 or 120 mg DCW ml 1).
Reactions were started by the addition of MB9 to a Ô¨Ånal
concentration of 0.96 mM. Decolourisation was monitored at
550 nm ( lmax for MB9). After decolourisation levels reached
values higher than 85% ( 24 h of reaction), mixtures were shaken
at 180 rpm, at 37C, for an additional period of 24 h. Recycled
biocatalysts were tested for the Ô¨Årst enzymatic step, as follows:
after 24 h of reaction, 5 ml of 0.96 mM of MB9 was added to the
reaction mixture. This procedure was repeated four times in 24-
h periods up to a maximum of 96 h. After this time, the second
step with CotA-laccase was performed as described above. The
products of reactions after the Ô¨Årst and second enzymatic steps
were quantiÔ¨Åed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using a calibration curve performed with an isolated Ô¨Ånal
compound (please see below). Each experience was performed at
least Ô¨Åve times, and standard deviations were lower than 15%.Product Characterisation
UV‚Äìvisible spectra of substrates and reaction mixtures were
obtained on a Nicolet Evolution 300 spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher ScientiÔ¨Åc, Waltham, MA, United States). Decolourisation
was assessed by measuring the absorbance of reaction mixtures
at the wavelength of maximal absorbance for each dye tested
[decolourisation (%) = (Abs initial-Abs Ô¨Ånal)/Abs Ô¨Ånal 100].
For the identiÔ¨Åcation of products, reaction mixtures were
lyophilised, suspended in appropriate deuterated solvent, and
analysed by NMR.1H- and13C-NMR spectra were obtained
at room temperature with an Advance Bruker 400 MHz
spectrometer (Billerica, MA, United States) in CD 3OD- d4or
D2O solvents (see Supplementary Table 1 ). The chemical shifts
are reported in part per million (ppm) using the solvent signal
as internal reference. The Ô¨Ånal product of MB9 conversion, after
the sequential action of PpAzoR and CotA-laccase, was separated
and collected by HPLC, and its molecular extinction coeÔ¨Écient
was determined in the concentration range of 0.05‚Äì0.8 mM at
430 nm using a Synergy 2, BioTek (Winooski, VT, United States)
microplate reader. For the quantiÔ¨Åcation of products of reactions
using MB9, samples of reaction were centrifuged and analysed
by HPLC on a Waters Alliance 2695 equipped with a Waters
photodiode array detector. The separations were performed in
a Purospher STAR RP-18e column (250 mm 4 mm), 5- mm
particle size (Merck, KGaA, Gernsheim, Germany). The injection
volume was 60 ml, and the Ô¨Çow rate was 0.8 ml min 1at
a column oven temperature of 40C. Eluent A was 0.1 M of
ammonium acetate pH 6.7, and eluent B was a mixture of
methanol:acetonitrile (70:30, v/v). The following gradient was
used for products separation: 0‚Äì2 min, isocratic elution of 100%
eluent A; 2‚Äì16 min, linear gradient from 100 to 60% of eluent
A; 16‚Äì24 min, linear gradient from 60 to 45% of eluent A; 24‚Äì
28 min, linear gradient from 45 to 20% of eluent A; 28‚Äì32 min,
isocratic elution of 20% eluent A; 32‚Äì30 min, linear gradient from
20 to 100% of eluent A; and 33‚Äì43 min, equilibrium to the initial
conditions of the following injection.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Two-Step Bioconversion of Dyes Using
PuriÔ¨Åed Enzymes
The reactions of PpAzoR azoreductase, with the Ô¨Åve azo
dyes, were performed under anaerobic conditions and yielded
decolourisation levels above 85% after 24 h of reaction as assessed
by UV‚ÄìVis at the lmaxof each dye ( Table 1 ). The Ô¨Ånal reaction
mixtures were analysed by1H-NMR spectroscopy (in CD 3OD-
d4;Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures 1‚Äì4 ), which indicated
the complete disappearance of the initial dyes and the presence
of aromatic amines as well as NADC, the oxidation product of
NADH and other compounds derived from the NADH/NADC
degradation. In the reduction of the MB9 by the PpAzoR one
aromatic amine, SAHBS was detected in the1H-NMR spectrum
(Figure 1C,b ), similarly to the other dyes where only one of the
two expected amines was identiÔ¨Åed ( Supplementary Table 2 ),
except in the case of DR80 dye, where two of the three expected

amines were identiÔ¨Åed ( Table 1 ). SAHNS, 2 ( Supplementary
Figure 1C ), SDAHNS, 3 ( Supplementary Figure 2C ), and
SANTS, 4 ( Supplementary Figure 3C ) are products of the
reaction with MB3, AR266, and RY145, respectively; and SABS,
5, and SDBS, 6 ( Supplementary Figure 4C ) are from the reaction
with DR80. The absence of some expected amines in the reaction
mixtures is attributed to their autoxidation, upon exposure
to oxygen, leading to the production of unstable forms and
further involvement in oligomeric or polymeric reactions, as
previously reported (Kudlich et al., 1999; Pinheiro et al., 2004;
Carvalho et al., 2008).
The second step of the biotransformation was initiated
upon addition of CotA-laccase and set-up of aerobic conditions
(Martins et al., 2002). The oxidation of SAHBS (1), the PpAzoR
product from the MB9 dye, resulted in the formation of the
coloured sodium 2-amino-3-oxo-3 H-phenoxazine-8-sulphonate(7) (Forte et al., 2010). The oxidation of compound 2,
the PpAzoR product from MB3, led to the formation of
ortho -naphthoquinone (8) (Sousa, 2015). Considering the
enzymatic pathway proposed for the oxidation of ortho -
aminophenol derivatives mediated by CotA-laccase, the ortho -
quinone core can be obtained through a hydrolysis process of the
ortho -quinoneimine intermediate formed during CotA-laccase
oxidation (Sousa et al., 2014). The CotA-laccase oxidation of
the SDAHNS (3), obtained from AR266, originates a complex
mixture of products, resulting from putative reoxidation,
polymerisation, or hydrolysis processes, which impaired their full
characterisation. For RY145, the analysis of the mixture after
the second enzymatic oxidative step showed that amine (4) is
not a substrate of CotA-laccase probably due to the presence
of the three electron-withdrawing sulphonate groups, thereby
decreasing the electron density in the naphthalenic structure

and making the amine group less favourable to oxidation (Sousa
et al., 2013). The mixture obtained by CotA-laccase oxidation
of amines SABS (5) and SDBS (6) reveals the presence of a
coloured phenazine (9), obtained from the self-coupling reaction
of SDBS (Sousa et al., 2014), while SABS (5) due to the
presence of the electron-deÔ¨Åcient sulphonate group in the para
position is not a CotA-laccase substrate (Sousa et al., 2013).
Overall, our results show that the sequential use of PpAzoR and
CotA results in the conversion of all azo dyes into structurally
diÔ¨Äerent building blocks, aromatic amines, naphthoquinones,
phenoxazinones, and phenazines. These are biological active
motifs of antibiotics (McDonald et al., 1999), antitumor agents
(Corona et al., 2009; Vairavelu et al., 2014), and pesticides
(Piro et al., 2013). They are also useful precursors for the
manufacturing of pharmaceuticals (Cholo et al., 2012), Ô¨Åne
chemicals (Forte et al., 2010; Morel and Christie, 2011), andbiosensors (Piro et al., 2013). Furthermore, synthetic chemical
approaches for the synthesis of these heteroaromatic compounds
use stoichiometric amounts of chemicals, strong acids, and high
temperatures and result in low production yields (Shruti et al.,
2018). In order to set up not only environment-friendly but
also cost-eÔ¨Äective processes, we performed dye conversion assays
using free and immobilised whole-cell systems that overproduced
the enzymes of interest.
Set-Up of Free and Immobilised
Whole-Cell Systems
Whole-cell bioprocesses are very advantageous since they reduce
operational costs associated with enzyme puriÔ¨Åcation and the
supply of expensive co-factors such as NAD(P)H, which is
recycled by the metabolism of resting cells (Carvalho, 2016;

Resonances due to SAHBS (Ô¨Ålled squares) and compound 7 (Ô¨Ålled circles) are labelled.
Lin and Tao, 2017). Moreover, processes with whole cells (i.e.,
resting cells) are very advantageous since cells eÔ¨Éciently take
out oxygen from the media and allow the anaerobic PpAzoR
to decolourise azo dyes while avoiding the need of using
Ô¨Çasks sealed with rubber stoppers and made anaerobic by
argon bubbling. Therefore, time-course decolourisation assays
of the model dye MB9 were performed using diÔ¨Äerent E. coli
strains overproducing PpAzoR variant 2A1-Y179H, which shows
fourfold higher activity than the wild-type enzyme (Brissos et al.,
2014). Whole-cell reactions resulted in decolourisation levels
close to 95% with 70‚Äì91% product yields (0.66‚Äì0.87 mM of
SAHBS; Figures 2A,B ) after 24 h of reaction. In general, itwas observed that the levels of decolourisation were higher
than product yields most likely related to adsorption of dyes
to cell surfaces (Prigione et al., 2008). The1H-NMR analysis
of the reaction mixtures showed only resonances attributed to
SAHBS ( Figures 2C,a ), in contrast to the reactions using puriÔ¨Åed
enzymes where NADPH was added to the reaction mixtures (see
Figures 1C,b ), but also the presence of other signals, which are
due to intracellular metabolites derived from cells. Next, we have
performed reactions in alginate-immobilised cells, considering
that immobilisation eases the recycling of biocatalysts, which
is critical for the implementation of cost-eÔ¨Äective processes
(Devi et al., 2017). Decolourisation with immobilised cells was

slower (90% decolourisation only after 72 h; Figure 2B ),
most likely due to the presence of the alginate matrix that
restricts diÔ¨Äusion of substrate through the beads. However,
reactions with immobilised cells displayed a cleaner1H-NMR
spectrum indicating that cell encapsulation prevented leakage
of undesirable intracellular metabolites ( Figures 2C,b ).E. coli
KRX cells were selected for further studies considering their
superior performance ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 5 ).
The amount of cells in alginate beads was increased from 60 to
120 mg DCW ml 1, and buÔ¨Äer was replaced by water to increase
the cost-eÔ¨Äectiveness and sustainability of the bioprocess, and
after 24 h, a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in decolourisation of MB9 (89%)
was achieved ( Supplementary Figure 6 ). In these conditions, the
conversion yields of MB9 to SAHBS reached 74% ( Table 2 ). The
addition of CotA-laccase resulted in the full conversion (99%) of
the amine to the phenoxazinone (7) ( Figures 2C,c and Table 2 ).
Next, we tested a recycling system by using a 24-h stepwise
addition of a 0.96 mM MB9 dye to immobilised cells containing
the PpAzoR azoreductase under static conditions, which resulted
in a slight increase in the Ô¨Ånal product yields ( Table 2 ).
Finally, one-pot reactions were set up using immobilised E. coli
cells that have co-produced both the PpAzoR and the CotA
enzymes, reducing twofold the time and cost associated with
cell production ( Table 2 ). One-pot bioprocesses show obvious
advantages such as low costs, higher yields, and environmental
beneÔ¨Åts (Sydnes, 2014). The sequential activity of the two
enzymes was controlled by the aeration conditions: Ô¨Årst, static
conditions during 24 h to promote PpAzoR activity, followed
by stirring at 180 rpm for 24 h reaction, where CotA that
couples the oxidation of substrates to the reduction of oxygen to
water is active. This approach resulted in lower phenoxazinone
yields (50%) as compared when using E. coli cells harbouring
separately the target enzymes ( Table 2 ). However, when the
Ô¨Årst step was performed in a recycled manner, i.e., through 24-
h stepwise addition of dye solution, the overall performance
improved signiÔ¨Åcantly, aÔ¨Äording 91% product yields. The activity
recovery was measured in both the two-step and the one-pot
reactions, and we found that after the Ô¨Årst, second, and third
cycles, the activity measured is around 100, 75, and 60% of the
initial activity, respectively; it takes four cycles to observe a drop
in the biocatalyst activity to values around 40% of the initial
activity. The high yields of products achieved give conÔ¨Ådencefor their ease puriÔ¨Åcation using preparative HPLC techniques.
This enzymatic system resulted in 80‚Äì100% decolourisation of
model acid, reactive, and direct dye baths (Mendes et al., 2011a).
The toxicity after the sequential treatment was also signiÔ¨Åcantly
reduced, giving good indications that valuable compounds can
be extracted from these model dye baths. Further studies to
substantiate the biocatalytic eÔ¨Éciency of the system proposed
using model and real wastewaters need to be performed in order
to fully exploit the enzymatic bioprocesses described that respect
principles of circularity, sustainability, and planetary boundaries.
CONCLUSION
Azo dyes are xenobiotic molecules whose structures were
designed to resist decolourisation and degradation, which in
turn challenge its sustainable and eÔ¨Écient eradication from
the environment. We had proven that the sequential use of
PpAzoR azoreductase and CotA-laccase enzymes resulted in
the decolourisation, degradation, and conversion into valuable
compounds of a set of azo dyes, mordant, acid, reactive
and direct, and low-cost feedstock, commonly found in dye-
containing wastewaters of textile-related industries. For the
set-up of the biocatalytic bioprocess, we took advantage of
the previously known complementary catalytic properties of
azoreductases and laccases; i.e., azoreductases reduce azo dyes to
aromatic amines and laccases promote their oxidative coupling
into valuable aromatic compounds, precursors of biologically
active molecules. Free and immobilised whole cells of E. coli
containing these enzymes allowed developing an economically
feasible bioprocess resulting in less contaminated reaction
mixtures with Ô¨Ånal product yields that go up to 90%. The
optimised biocatalytic systems oÔ¨Äer a sustainable and promising
approach for cleaning up dye-containing wastewaters while
producing valuable chemicals with a range of applications in
chemical industries.
