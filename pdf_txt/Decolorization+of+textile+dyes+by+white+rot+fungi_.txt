DATE: The decoloration of dyes by the white rot fungus, Trametes versicolor 
Six species of white rot fungi (Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, Lentinus edodes, 
Phanerochaete 
chtysosporium. 
Pleuroius 
ostreatus, 
Trametes 
hirsuta, 
Trame tes 
versicolor) were screened for their ability to decolorize 6 dyes on solid culture medium. 
Of 
these, Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 and T. versicolor ATCC 20869 decolorized the 
greatest number of dyes to the greatest 
extent and were chosen for aqueous decoloration 
studies. P. chrysosporium was included for cornparison purposes. 
The 
aqueous 
decoloration of 7 smicturally diverse dyes was examined in static 
and agitated cultures. Decoloration required culture agitation (200 rpm), which resulted in 
the formation of mycelial pellets. 
Batch 
cultures 
of T. versicolor completely decolorized al1 the dyes tested at 
concentrations from 20 to 60 ppm, either individually, in mixtures or sequentially. The 
culture 
medium was completely decolorized, with no visible sorption of the dye to the 
mycelia. The choice of buffer was critical, with 2,2'-dimethylsuccinic acid providing 
good pH 
control during decoloration. Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 and P. chrysosporium had 
lirnited ability for 
sequential 
decoloration and were not 
Mer 
studied. 
During 
successive decolorations by batch cultures, decoloration rates decreased 
and ceased by day 15, coinciding with the depletion of glucose. Replenishing glucose 
levels 
to 5 g/L restored and sustained rapid decoloration for another 15 days. 
Decoloration required nitrogen limitation as rapid decoloration was sustained 
when the NH,' concentration was maintained at O or 1.2 mM, but was inhibited at 12 mM. Furthemore, when the concentration of NH,' in actively decolorizing cultures was 
increased from 1.2 mM to 12 mM, decoloration ceased. 
High 
levels 
of 
laccase 
and 
manganese 
peroxidase were detected in the 
extracellular medium. Lignin peroxidase was not detected at any time. The cell-free 
medium was incapable of decoloration. When the separated biomass was resuspended in 
fresh 
medium, high rates of decoloration were resumed. These results indicate that 
decoloration may require a biomass-associated enzyme or factor which may be expressed 
during 
nitrogen 
limitation.

Introduction 
The current worldwide production of more than 100,000 commercial textile dyes 
exceeds 600,000 tonnes 
annually. 
In 1990, synthetic dye production in the United States 
alone was approximately 129,000 tonnes (Elliott, 1996). It is estimated that 10 to 15 % 
of these dyes are lost in effluent fiom industrial dyeing processes at concentrations of 10 
to 15 ppm. Textile dye wastewaters are usually treated in conventional, aerobic, activated 
sludge systems. Due to their complex, aromatic 
structures and synthetic origins, most 
dyes are recalcitrant to microbial degradation. This results in an intensely colored 
discharge 
From 
water 
treatment 
facilites (Davis et al., 1994 ). Since most dyes impart 
strong 
color 
at concentrations even below 1 ppm, post-treatment persistence of color is an 
aesthetic problem in receiving waters. 
Curent 
decoloration technologies 
involve 
expensive chemical and physical 
methods 
such as carbon adsorption, flocculation and chemical oxidation. Attempts to 
develop biological decoloration systems have been 
largely 
unsuccessful 
due to poor 
bacterial degradation of dyes. 
Over the past decade, ille white rot hgi have been extensively studied for their 
ability 
to 
degrade the complex plant polymer, lignin, and a broad spectrum of xenobiotic 
pollutants. 
Degradation is 
ascribed 
to 
non-specific 
oxidation by extracellular, lignin- 
degrading enzymes such as lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and the 
laccases. Several factors make the white rot fungi particularly suitable for bioremediation 
applications. The non-specificity of the 
ligninolytic 
enzymes 
allows 
for the degradation 
of a range of pollutants, without extensive acclimation. Since the enzymes are 
extracellular, 
large 
moIecules 
such as dyes can be degraded without transport across the 
ce11 wall, which ofien bits bacterial degradation. (Reddy, 1995). 
The global objective of this work was to develop a biodecoloration process to 
treat dye-contaminated effluents 
using a species of white rot fungus. Of the seven species 
screened for decoloration 
potential, Bjerkondera sp. BOS55 and Trametes versicolor 
decolorized the greatest nurnber of dyes. The decoloration of different dyes and dye 
mixtures, as well as successive dye additions, by these hvo species, as well as 
P.chrysosporium, was studied in aqueous batch cultures. Based on its ability to 
decolorize 
several 
repeated dye and dye mixture additions, T. versicolor was chosen as 
the most suitable for a biodecoloration process. Dye decoloration by T. versicolor was 
characterized in terms of culture conditions, nutritional requirements and the ligninolytic 
enzymes involved in the decoloration process. Some 
preliminary 
studies were performed 
to investigate decoloration in a 
bench-scale 
bioreactor. Chapter 2 
Literature review 
2.1 The Canadian perspective 
In 1982, about 6,400,000 kg of dyes were imported into Canada (Statistics 
Canada. 1982). There are close to 1 O00 textiles mills in Canada, mostly located in 
Quebec 
and Ontario. 
Much 
of Canada's textile industry is 
concentrated 
in the Eastern 
Townships of 
Quebec 
southeast of Montreai (Maguire, 1992; Maguire and Tkacz, 1991). 
The first occurrence of dyes in the Canadian environment was demonstrated in the 
Yarnaska River in Quebec between 1985-1987. Disperse Red 60, Disperse Blue 26, 
Disperse Blue 79 and 12 other unidentified dyes were identified in waters downstream 
fiorn 
several 
textile mills (Maguire and Tkacz, 199 1). 
New textile facilities are being established in northeastem and northwestem New 
Brunswick (Laughton et ai., 1997). Wastewaters fiom facilities in northwestem New 
Brunswick wili be discharged to the Madawaska River. A key concem is the chernical 
quality and toxicity of this effluent. 
2.2 Textile wastewaters 
Substantial volumes of water and chemicais are consumed during the wet 
processing of textiles. Wastewater 
fkom 
these 
processes are the main route of 
environmental contamination (Banat et al., 1997). The compostion of these wastewaters 
is 
extremely 
variable due to the large number of dyes and chemicals used in dyeing processes and results in great variability in the success of different treatment processes 
(Dubrow et al., 1996). 
Textile wastewater 
generally has relatively low concentrations of nitrogen and 
phosphorus and high concentrations of inorganic salts. The rnajority of the biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD) is due to soluble, colorless organics such as emulsifiers, bleaches, 
soaps, 
oils, 
and dispersing, 
desizing, 
scouring, 
levelling 
and reducing agents, 
which 
are 
easily 
removed by conventional activated sludge treatment (Banat et al., 1997). More 
than 
8,000 products associated 
with 
the dyeing process are listed in the 
Colour 
Index 
(Society of Dyers and Colourists. 1976). Although color is a visible pollutant, its 
contribution to the BOD is relatively low (Banat et al., 1997; Clark and Anliker, 1980; 
Dubrow et al., 1996). 
2.3 Dye Classes 
Dyes are organic molecules that impart color by absorbing visible light from 400 
to 700 nm (Zollinger, 1987). The chromophore is the portion of the molecule that irnparts 
color. The polyaromatic, polysubstituted dye molecules include phenyi and napthyl 
moieties and functional groups such as -OH, CH,, SO,Na and NH?. Synthetic groups 
such as azo linkages and S0,Na do not occur naturally. 
There is tremendous structural and chernical diversity among dyes from the 
various classes. Dyes can be classified by the structure of their chromophore, the method 
of application or their water solubility. They are classified as azo, anthraquinone, 
phthalocyanine 
and di or 
triphenylmethane 
by their 
chromophoric 
groups 
or as acid, 
basic, direct, reactive, or disperse by the method of application (Jenkins, 1978). For example, the dye Remazol Black B (Hoechst Celanese Corp.,) is a diazo dye 
due to the presence of 
two N=N chromophoric groups. It is also listed as (C.I.) Reactive 
Black 5 due to the presence of two vinyl sulfone (-Sot-CH=CHJ reactive moities which 
bind the dye to the fabric. Most dyes are catalogued in the Colour Index (C.I.) by the 
method of application as well as by chernicd structure. 
Azo 
dyes are the most diverse of al1 the groups and comprise over 50% of global 
dye production (Weber, 1988). 
These 
dyes are 
also 
the most toxic, with some being 
potential carcinogens (Chung et al., 198 1 ; Chung and Stevens, 1993; Clarke and Anliker, 
1980; 
Holme 
1984; 
Zollinger, 
1987). 
2.3.1 The reactive dyes 
The reactive dyes are becoming increasingly important in the global market, with 
their use increasing from 6 to 12% of overdl dye consurnption between 1980 and 1985 
(Schrarnm et al., 1988; Shore. 1990). Up to 50% of reactive dyes are hydrolyzed and lost 
to 
effluent during the dyeing process (Heinfiing et al., 1997). These dyes are mostly azo 
or phthalocyanine dyes with reactive groups that bind covalently with nucleophilic 
groups on the textile; this group is usuaily -Sot-CH2-CH,-CH,-OS0,- (Weber, 1988; 
Zollinger, 1987). Reactive dyes are of 
particular 
concem 
since 20 to 25% in wastewaters 
is in the fiom of toxic vinyl sulfone (Camp and Sturrock, 1 990; Weber, 1988) 
2.4 Biodecoloration vs. biodegradation 
Mineralization is the complete decomposition of the molecule into HzO, CO, and 
inorganics. Biodecoloration of a dye requires only the degradation of the chromophore 
and may not indicate mineralization of the molecule. This should be distinguished fiom 
sorption of the dye to the microbial biomass, as this may result in the removal of the dye from an effluent, but not rnolecuiar degradation. The main process of dye removal in 
many dye biodegradation studies is sorption to microbial biomass (Lieberman et al., 
1988; Pagga and Brown, 1986; Shaul et al., 1991 ; Shukia and Pandey, 1991). 
2.5 Conventional treatment of textile effluents 
Textile mil1 effluents are conventionally treated in aerobic, activated sludge 
systems in municipal facilities (Dubrow et al., 1996). Although the BOD is adequately 
reduced by the degradation of 
other 
organics in the waste, dyes are generally resistant to 
biodegradation in 
these 
systems (Banat et al., 1997; Brown et al., 198 1 ; Clarke and 
Anliker, 
1980; 
Shaul et al., 199 1). The bacterial degradation of a dye requires acclimation 
of the microbial population for prolonged 
periods. 
Constant fluctuations in the types and 
concentrations of dyes in textile effluents generally make acclimation difficult. It has 
aiso been suggested that dyes may be inhibitory to the activated sludge microbial 
population (Ogawa et al., 
1988). 
During 
activated sludge treatment, a small percentage of dye is biodegraded. Up 
to 20% of the dye may pass through untreated (Dubrow et al., 1996). Between 40 % and 
80% is adsorbed to the biomass (Clarke and Anliker, 1980), with a considerable amount 
either 
sorbed or trapped in 
flocs 
in the sludge (Dohanyas et al., 1978; Dubrow et al., 1996; 
Ganesh et al., 1994; Shaul et al.,1987; Shaul et al., 199 1). The degree of adsorption varies 
with the different dye classes (Dubrow et al., 1996), and is increased by the presence of 
hydroxyl, nitro and azo groups (Clarke and Anliker, 1980). 
The ineffectiveness of conventional activated sludge for dye decoloration has 
been confirmed in lab and pilot-scale decoloration studies. Pagga and Brown (1 986) 
demonstrated that of 87 
stnicturally 
diverse 
dyes, 
only 
13 % were degraded to any significant extent. In a study with 18 azo and direct dyes, only 3 dyes were found to be 
decolorized (Shaul et al., 1988) and in a separate study, only 2 out of 7 acid azo dyes 
were 
decolorized 
(Shaul et al.. 1986). 
2.6 Color removal by physico-chernical methods 
The lack of color removal in conventionai water treatment facilities has 
necessitated the examination of alternative decoloration methods for 
dye-contaminated 
effluents. 
Although 
significant 
color 
removai 
can 
be achieved with chemical coagulants, 
powdered activated carbon and redox agents, the required dosages are generally too large 
to be 
econornically 
feasible 
(Banat et al., 1987). Other factors preventing the application 
of physicochemical treatment methods include excessive 
chemical 
usage, sludge 
disposal 
problems, costly plant 
requirements, 
inapplicability to a wide variety of dyes, insufficient 
color 
reduction and sensitivity to 
fluctuating 
wastewater compositions (Banat et ai., 1997; 
Dubrow et al., 2 996). 
2.6.1 Physical beatment methods 
2.6.1. I Adsorption 
Carbon adsorption is an effective method for lowering the concentration of 
dissolved organics in effluent. 
Adsorbance 
of a compound is enhanced by increasing 
molecular 
size and number of aromatic rings and by decreasing solubility, polarity and 
carbon 
chah 
branching. 
Several 
pilot and commercial systems using activated 
carbon 
columns 
have been 
developed to decolonze dye effluents (Reife and Freedman, 1996). However, in general. 
carbon 
adsorption of dyes is not 
very 
efficient or 
economical. This is mainly due to poor 
adsorption of dyes, polar molecules, to 
carbon, 
a 
nonpolar 
compound. Carbon adsorption is most effective as a finishing step following chernical 
reduction, 
which 
generates by-products with better carbon adsorbability than the parent 
dyes (Reife and 
Freedman, 
1996). This process (chernical reduction and adsorption of 
dyes) was developed and patented by the Asahi Chernical Company. 
2.6.1.2 Electrochemical technology 
This system most cornrnonly consists of an electrochemical ce11 containing a 
number 
of steel electrodes separated by gaps. Wastewater flows 
through 
these 
gaps and 
contacts the steel electrodes. As current flows from one electrode to the next, the 
cathodes give off 
ferrous 
ions and the anodes, hydrogen gas and hydroxyl ions. The dye 
molecules are physically removed by association with the resulting matrix of ferrous 
hydroxide, ferric hydroxide and femc oxyhydroxide, which then precipitates. Precipitate 
removal requires electrochemical treatment to be coupled with a process such as filtration 
or clarification. When alurninum electrodes are used, the dyes are removed by the 
resulting alurninum matrix. 
This process has been shown to reduce the BOD, total suspended solids (TSS), 
heavy 
metals and 
color 
in dye effluent (Wilcock et al., 1996; Wilcock et al., 1992). Pilot 
studies with this system have demonstrated decoloration eficiencies of over 90% for 
direct, disperse, sulfur, acid, reactive and basic dyes (Wilcock et al., 1996). 
The first patent on the application for electrochemical technology to treat textile 
wastewaters was issued to Andco Environmental Processes in 1 989. 
2.6.1.3 Membrane jiItration for dyestuff recovery 
Ultrafiiltration is the most studied membrane filtration process for the treatment of 
colored wastewaters (Elliott, 1 996). This pressure-driven process separates macrornolecules such as dyes fiom the solvent, by "filtering" the solution through the 
membrane. The concentrate consists of intact, reusable dye moleciiles and the water 
permeate for reuse or discharge. Studies indicate 
that the dyes rnay be concentrated to 0.5 
to 1 % of the initial volume in the concentrate to obtain almost colorless water in the 
permeate 
(Elliott, 
1996). 
Membrane-based processes are used to 
minimize 
wastewater volume and recycle 
process waters within the mil1 rather than as an end-of-pipe treatment. Currently, the 
economics of membrane technology to treat textile wastewaten, especially hi& capital 
costs, are uifavourable. 
2.6.2 Chemical methods 
2.6.2.1 Chemical reduction 
Water-soluble dyes containing azo or other reducible groups can be chemically 
reduced by agents such as sodium hydrosulfite, thiourea dioxide and sodium borohydride 
to generate aromatic amines (Cook, 1996). These compounds are readily metabolized in 
activated sludge, chemically oxidized. adsorbed on carbon or precipitated by polycationic 
agents. A major azo dye manufacturer has successfully implemented a sodium 
borohydride reduction process to remove effluent color and stabilize resulting solids at 
one of its plants (Cook, 1996). 
2.6.2.2 Ozonation 
Ozone, one of the strongest oxidants, decolorizes dyes by attacking the most 
reactive site in the molecule. This generates colorless byproducts, which can be removed 
physically by flocculation or coagulation or fkrther degraded biologically (Lin and Lin, 
1993; 
Matsui, 
1996). However, the reactivity of ozone varies with dyes fiom different classes, with no decoloration of certain dyes (Matsui, 1996). Although there are currently 
no commercial 
methods 
in application, some pilot studies show promise 
(Matsui, 
1996). 
2.6.3 The PAC* systern 
This process, patented by Zirnpro Environmental, is a combined powdered 
activated 
carbon-activated 
sludge system to 
remove 
organic 
matenais 
in wastewater 
(Hutton 
et al., 1996). 
In the 
treatrnent 
of textile 
effluent? 
powdered activated 
carbon 
is added to the 
activated sludge process at concentrations fiom 10-5000 ppm of activated carbod 
sludge. The primary mechanism of dye removal is adsorption to the activated carbon. 
However, the adsorbed dye may also be further biodegraded in the sludge. Excess solids 
are 
eliminated with the removal of a small Stream from sludge recycle. Waste solids, 
consisting of powdered activated 
carbon, 
activated sludge, adsorbed organics and inerts. 
are directed to solids processing. 
ne 
major advantage of PACTB is reduced investment cost. Efficient color 
removal by this system has been demonstrated in pilot and full-scale facilities (Hutton et 
al. 1996). 
2.7 Dye biodegradation 
2.7.1 Aerobic bacterid degradation 
The aerobic degradation of dyes by bacteria is poorly understood (Ganesh et al., 
1994), with most studies confined to azo dyes. Little or no degradation has been shown. 
with color removal attributed mainly to sorptiori (Dohanyas et al., 1978; Pagga and 
Brown, 1986). Most instances of aerobic dye decoloration appear to involve facultative anaerobes capable of both aerobic and anaerobic degradation. The mechanism of 
decoloration for 
azo 
dyes is 
thought 
to be reductive fission of the azo bonds.

Only a few bacteria have been shown to degrade the azo bond aerobically (Chung 
and Stevens, 1987). The enzyme azo reductase, by which most azo dyes are degraded, is 
inhibited by oxygen. However, the aerobic reduction of simple azo compounds has been 
demonstrated with species such as Baciflus subtilis (Horitsu et al., 1977), Aeromonas 
hydrophila (Idaka et al., 1 978), Pseudornonas S-42 (Liu and Yang, 1 989) and 
Flavobacterium (Kulla et al., 1983). 
In the study by Harmer and Bishop (1992), no single isolate ffom biofilms in an 
activated sludge process was capable of growth on Acid Orange 7. However, when supplemented with carbon and peptone, over 30 isolates capable of AO-7 decoloration 
were obtained, including species of deromonas, FZavobacterium, Agrobacterium, 
A Zcaligenes and Pseudornonacis. 
2.7.2 Aerobic chernostat isolaies 
Several examples of aerobic dye degradation involve bacteria isolated fiom the 
highly selective environment of a chemostat. Kulla et al. (1 983) used a chemostat to 
enrich 
for 
microorganisms 
capable of 
using 
cornplex 
azo 
dyes as sole sources of carbon 
and 
nitrogen. 
Orange I and Orange II were selected as substrates. After 655 generations, 
strain KF46, capable of growth on Orange II, was isolated. During subsequent cultivation 
with Orange I as the carbon source, a further 21 6 generations passed before K24, capable 
of degrading Orange 1, was obtained. KF46 was found to have an Orange II-specific azo 
reductase and K24, an Orange 1-specific azo reductase. 
The degradative potential of chemostat cultures is usually restricted to the specific 
dye to which the 
organism 
is acclimated (Kulla et al., 1983; Michaels and Lewis, 1986). 
Since industrial effluents contain mixtures of structurally diverse dyes, chemostat isolated 
cultures are not practical in 
treatment 
processes. 
2.7.3 Anaerobic bacterid degradaiion 
There are several reports of azo dye decoloration by anaerobic bacteria (Chung 
and Stevens, 1993). The anaerobic decoloration of azo dyes is usually attributed to am 
reductases, which reduce the am bond to generate colorless aromatic amines. These 
compounds, which are often toxic, mutagenic, andor carcinogenic (Chung et al., 1978; 
Chung and Stevens, 1993; Kulla et al., 1983; Meyer, 198 1 ; Zimrnerman et al., l982), are not Mer degraded anaerobically. The generation of these compounds has prevented 
implementation of anaerobic treatment systems for dye effluents. 
In 
early 
studies, Dieckhues (1960) screened 21 bacteria against 14 azo dyes and 
found each species to anaerobically reduce al1 of the dyes, with species of Streptococczis. 
Proteus and Bacillus being particularly active. 
2.7.4 Dye decoloration by anaerobic consorria 
A recent study reported the anaerobic decoloration of several commercially 
important textile dyes by a microbial consortium, PD W (Nigarn et al., 1996). 
Approximately 76% of a synthetic textile plant effluent was decolorized in 3 days, in the 
presence of a carbon source in addition to the dyes. Growth was facultatively anaerobic, 
but decoloration required 
strictly 
anaerobic conditions. 
Three 
mixed 
cultures were found to 
decolonze 
from 77 to 85% of a highly 
coloured 
industrial 
effluent, 
containing 
a 
diazo-iinked 
chromophore, in a 2 to 3 day 
period (Knapp and Newby, 1995). Members of the consortia were identified as 
facultativeiy anaerobic Bacillus species and anaerobic CZostridium species. 
Oxspring et al. ( 1996) reported the decoloration of the reactive dye, Remazol 
Black B, by an irnrnobilized microbial consortium, consisting prirnarily of Alcaligenes 
faecalis and Cornmamonas midovarans, in an upflow anaerobic filter. Over 95% of 
Remazol Black B, at initial concentrations of 0.5 g/L, was decolorized within 48 hou, 
producing metabolites 
that 
were 
probabl 
y 
aromatic 
amines. 
2.7.5 Anaero bidaero bic treatment processes 
A microbial consortium capable of mineralizing the sulfonated azo dye Mordant 
Yeilow 
was 
reported (Haug et al., 199 1). Table 2.2 Examples of dye degradation by anaerobic bacteria

An alteration from anaerobic to aerobic conditions was required to achieve 
mineralization. This was attributed to the activity of different organisms during each 
phase resulting in complete degradation. Anaerobically-generated aromatic amines may be Mer degraded aerobically 
(Brown and Laboureur, 1983; Banat et al., 1991), suggesting that sequential anaerobic- 
aerobic treatrnent processes may result in extensive dye degradation or mineralization. A 
biphasic anaerobiclaerobic treatment process resulted in an increase in decoloration from 
28% to 88% cornpared to an aerobic process alone (Dubrow et al., 1996). However, a 
major concem is that with exposure to oxygen, aromatic amines may rapidly foxm toxic 
brown po lymerization products. 
2.8 Dye removal by actinomycetes 
Severai actinomycete strains have been reported to remove azo, reactive, 
anthroquinone 
and 
phthalocyanine 
dyes fkom water. The mechanism of removal is 
adsorption of the dyes to the cellular biomass 
without 
any 
degradation (Zhou and 
Zimmerman, 1 993). 
2.9 Dye decoloration by fun@ 
2.9.1 Adsorption 
In most studies with fungi, dye removal has been attributed to mycelial 
adsorption. 
Examples 
of 
fungal dye decoloration by adsorption are surnmarized in Table 
2.3. 
2.10 The white rot fungi 
The white rot fungi are filamentous fungi belonging to the basidiomycete group. 
Pollutant 
degradation by the white rot 
fhgi 
is distinguished 
from 
bacteriai degradation in 
that the compounds do not serve as growth substrates. A separate carbon source is 
required for growth and metabolic activity. The expression and activity of the ligninolytic 
enzymes are 
believed 
to 
occur during secondary metabolism and nutrient limitation, following the pnmary growth phase. In this state, the cultures are ofien referred to as 
"Iigninol ytic cultures".

2.10.1 Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
Phanerochaete 
chrysosporiurn is the most extensively studied white rot Fungus. 
Its lignin-degrading system has been implicated in the degradation of several xenobiotic 
compounds including benzene, toluene, 
ethylbenzenes and xylenes (BTEX), 
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene, benzo [a] pyrene), chlorophenols (PCP, dioxins), 
chlorinated 
and 
halogenated 
polycyclic 
aromatics (DDT), chloroalkanes, bleach plant 
effluents, nitrotoluenes, pol ychlonnated bipheny ls, atrazine, and insecticides such as 
chlorpyrifos, fonofos, and terbufos (Bumpus et al., 1985; Bumpus and Aust, 1987; Field 
et al., 1993; Lamar, 1992; Reddy, 1995; Yadav and Reddy, 1993). However, the culture conditions required for the expression and activity of its ligninolytic enzymes (low 
nitrogen, high temperature (37"C), and static cultures) (Krk et al., 1978) have limited the 
practical application of 
this 
organism in bioremediation processes. 
2.1 0.1. 1 Dye decoloration by P. chrysosporium 
Most studies of dye decoloration by white rot fhgi have been conducted with P. 
chrysosporiurn. Decoloration occurs under secondary metabolism during nitrogen 
limitation and 
involves the LiPs and the MnPs. The range of dyes decolorized includes 
azo, triphenylmethane, heterocyclic and polymeric dyes. Table 2.4 summarizes dye 
decoloration studies 
performed with P. chrysosporium. 
Al1 these studies have examined the decoloration of a single addition of a particular dye. 
Consequently, they may be of limited use in assessing the potentiai of P.chrysosporizrm 
to treat the range and mixtures of dyes in textile effluents. 
2.10.2 Trametes versico lor 
Ligninolytic cultures of Trametes versicolor have been shown to degrade 
phenanthrene, 
anthracene, 
benzo[a]pyrene, 
anthroquinone, 
pentachlorophenol, 3,4- 
dichloroaniline, polychlorinated biphenyls (Aroclor 1254) and dieldrin (Alleman et ai. 
1995; Eaton, 
1985; 
Field et ai., 1992; Morgan et al., 1991 ; Vyas, B.R.M., 1994). The 
ligninolytic enzymes of T.versico1or include lacczse in addition to LiP and MnP. 
This organism has been studied extensively in the decoloration of bleach plant 
effluents (BPE) fiom pulp mills and the biobleaching of pulp (Addleman et al., 1995; 
Addleman and 
Archibald, 
1993; Archibald,

Pulping, bleaching and chernical recovery processes generate large volumes of colored 
effluent (Mehna et al., 
1995), with effluent from the initial alkali extraction stage 
contributing to 80% of the color. Most of the color is imparted by stable, high molecular 
weight chromophores 
fiom 
modified 
lignin 
residues (Addleman and Archibald, 1993). Bacterial aerobic and anaerobic processes reduce the BOD, but cannot decolorize these 
effluents (Archibaid et al., 1990) 
T. versicolor, in the fom of mycelium, mycelial pellets or mycelial fragments 
imrnobilized in alginate beads can rapidly decolorize BPE (Archibald et al., 1990; 
Livernoche et al., 1983; Mehna et al., 1995). Decoloration requires a separate carbon 
source (Archibald et al., 1990; Livemoche et ai., 1983; Mehna et al., 1995; Royer et al., 
1985) and several organic substrates have been shown to be suitable (Archibald et al., 
1990). Although the mechanism of BPE decoloration is not fully understood MnP and 
laccases appear to be central to the process. 
2.10.3 Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 
This fùngus, isolated only in 1992, produces a novel Mn-independent peroxidase 
(MiP) in addition to LiP and MnP. Uniike P. chrysosporium, the expression of the 
ligninolytic enzymes by this organism is reportedly enhanced in nitrogen sufficient 
medium. In a study of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation, which included 
P.chrysosporium and 7'. versicolor, degradation by Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 was the most 
extensive (Field et al., 1992). There are few other studies on the degradative potential of 
this organism. 
2.11 The lipin-degrading system 
The most important lignin-degrading enzymes are the lignin-peroxidases (LiPs), 
manganese-peroxidases 
(MnPs) 
and 
laccases (Lamar, 1992; Reddy, 1995). The 
peroxidases 
require H,O, for their activity. 
While 
these 
enzymes are the key components of the lignin-degrading system 
(LDS), other enzymes such as CBQase, cellulase, tyrosinase, glyoxal oxidase, pyranose oxidase are also produced in varying quantities by different species (Roy and Archibald, 
1993; 
Ruttiman-Johnson 
et al., 1994; Westermark and Eriksson, 1974; Zhao and Jhanse, 
1996). It is accepted that the ligninolytic systems are not 
fully 
characterized 
and that 
there 
may be other unidentified enzymes that contribute to ligninolytic activity. 
2.1 1.1 Lignin peroxidase 
LiPs are extracellular glycosylated heme proteins. In HzOz-dependent oxidations, 
aryl 
cation 
radicals 
are generated which are 
then 
mer 
degraded 
non-enzymatically 
(Reddy, 1995). LiPs are of 
particular 
interest in pollutant degradation due to their very 
high oxidation-reduction 
potential 
that permits the oxidation of xenobiotics not attacked 
by other enzymes (Lamar, 1993). Severai isoenzymes of LiP are produced, each distinct 
in terms of pH sensitivity and substrate specificity (Ollika et ai., 1993; Tien and Kirk, 
1988) 
Veratryl alcohol(3.3-dimethoxybenzyl dcohol) is a fungal metabolite which is 
necessary for 
LiP 
activity. 
Its exact 
role 
is 
unclear, 
but 
it 
is believed to play a role in 
preventing 
HzOl 
inactivation of the enzyme (Harvey et al., 1 986; Pazsczynski and 
Crawford, 199 1 ; Wariishi and Gold, 1990). 
A schematic of the LiP reaction mechanism is depicted in Figure 2.1. HzOz 
oxidizes LiP to the LiP(1) state. LiP (1) oxidizes the substrate and is simultaneously 
reduced to 
LiP(I1). It is believed that LiP(1I) then oxidizes veratryl alcohol to 
veratraldehyde and is reduced back to its native state in the process (Barr and Aust, 1994; 
Kersten et al., 1985). 2.1 1.2 Manganese peroxidme 
MnPs are extracellular glycosylated heme proteins that catalyze the H,O,- 
dependent oxidation of Mn(I1) to Mn(TII), which then fiuther mediates the oxidation of 
phenolic 
substrates. The structure of MnP is quite sirnilar to that of LiP except that it has 
five rather than four disuifide bonds (Reddy, 1995). Several isoenzymes of MnP have 
been identified (Leisola et ai., 1987; Paszczynski et al., 1986; Ruttimann-Johnson et al.,

Figure 2.1 Catalytic cycle of substrate oxidation by LiP 
The cataiytic cycle of substrate oxidation by MnP is depicted in Figure 2.2. MnP 
is oxidized fiom its native state to MnPO by H,O,. MnPO oxidizes Mn2' to Mi3', and is 
simuItaneousIy reduced to MnP(II). Simple organic acids chelate and form organic 
complexes that oxidize the substrate, regenerating Mn2' and the organic acid in the 
process. By oxidizing another hAn2+ ion to the Mn3+ state, MnPO is reduced back to 
native-state W. 2.12.3 hccases 
Laccases (benzenedioVoxygen oxidoreductase, phenol oxidase) are copper- 
containhg oxidases that oxidize polyphenols, methoxy-substituted phenols, diamines and 
other aromatic substrates (Thurston, 1994). u1 the presence of certain mediators such as 
2,2'-azlIio-bis(3-ethyIbe11~-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) the substrate range cm be 
expanded to include non-aromatic substrates (Bourbonnais and Paice, 1990). The 
mechanism of laccase oxidatim has not ken deteRnined; however, the one-electron 
oxidation of the substrate is coupled to a fourclectron oxidation of water, suggesting a 
relatively complex reaction mechanism (Thurston, 1 994).

Possible bioreactor configurations for the culture of white rot fhgi may be 
divided 
into 
agitated and non-agitated growth processes. Examples of bioreactor 
processes with white rot hingi are discussed in the following section. 
2.2 2.1 Agitated gro wth processes 
The ability of white rot fhgi to degrade lignin and other compounds has been 
shown 
to decrease 
drastically in mechanically aerated cultures (Alleman et al., 1 99 1 : 
Faison and Kirk, 1985; Jager et al., 1985; Kirk et al., 1978). The main concem with 
agitated cultures is decreased or lost production andhr activity of the ligninolytic 
enzymes, especiaily 
LiP. 
due to 
shear 
From 
mechanicd 
agitation. Although detergents 
such as Tween and polyethylene glycol prevent some inactivation, relatively low 
agitation speeds are 
still 
required (Asther et al., 1 987; Jager et al., 1985). 
2-12. I. 1 Agitated processes - suspended growth 
When agitated, freely suspended fimgal biomass grows as mycelial pellets. Pellet 
size is 
determined 
by the speed of agitation and the amount of biomass in the inoculurn 
(Jimenez-Tobon et al., 1997). Typical reactor conftigurations for suspended growth 
processes are conventional stirred tank reactors with mechanical mixing and air-lift 
fermentors, 
Bornamie 
et al. (1993) cornpared growth and ligninolytic enzyme production by 
P.chrysosporium in a stirred tank reactor, airlift fermentor and a bubble column reactor. 
Aeration in the pneumatically agitated reactors 
(airlifi and bubble colurnn) was achieved 
by sparging and in the stirred tank reactor, with marine impellers operated between 150 to 
300 rpm. More biomass and significantly higher levels of ligninolytic enzymes (eg. 6 to 9-fold more LiP) were produced in the pneurnatic reacton and were attributed to 
improved oxygen transfer. 
LiP production by P.chrysosporium was dernonstrated in a 42 L submerged 
shed 
tank reactor, but scale-up to a 300 L stirred tank reactor was unsuccessful 
(Jansheka. 
and Fiechter, 1988). While investigating growth and LiP production by 
P.chrysosporium in a stirred tank reactor, Venkatadri and lrvine ( 1990) fomd that the 
mycelia clumped and adhered to the walls and impellers, resulting in reiatively low yields 
of 
LiP. 
2-12.1.2 Agitated processes - Imrnobilized growth 
Fungal mycelium adheres to hydrophobie supports and is readily immobilized on 
porous particles 
such as agar, agarose, alginate or silicon beads, polyurethane foam or 
nylon web cubes, and macroporous glass (Kirkpatrick and Palmer, 1987; Linko et al., 
1986; Rogalski et al., 1992). These processes are often descnbed as "immobilized 
biocatalyst fermentations". The "biocatalysts" (support + fungus) can be agitated to 
improve mass and oxygen transfer without the problems encountered with freely 
suspended hgal pellets. Advantages include improved oxygen and mass transfer and 
the recycling and repeated use of the "biocatalystso'. However, such methods, in general, 
are expensive at an industrial scale. 
LiP production by agitated cultures of P. chrysosporiurn immobilized on agar, 
agarose and k-carrageenan gel beads, nylon web and polyurethane cubes was several fold 
higher than by fieely suspended mycelial pellets (Linko et al., 1986). The nylon and 
polyurethane-based 
biocatalysts were active for at least 38 days after the addition of 
veratryl alcohol, which triggered LiP expression. In a subsequent study, P-chrysosporiurn immobilized on 0.5 cm nylon web cubes or polyurethane foarn cubes in 
an 8 L bioreactor produced high maximum yields of LiP continuously for up to a week 
(Linko, 1988). Agitation was either with air andlor oxygen 80w only or with mechanical 
stimng at 220 rpm. 
T versicolor, immobilized in calcium alginate beads, achieved 80% decoloration 
of kraft wastewater compared to 60% by suspended pellets (Livemoche et al., 1983). 
2.12.2 Non-agitated imrnobilired growrh processes 
Several 
studies 
have examined fixed bed reactors, 
rotating 
biological contactors, 
rotating tube reactors and other configurations for the culture of white rot hgi. In fixed 
growth processes, the 
fungus 
forms a biofilm on the given surface. 
Hollow 
fiber 
reactors 
typically 
consist of hollow 
fibers 
mounted 
inside a 
c ylindrical cartridge. The rnicroporous structure and hydrophilic surfaces of the hollow 
fibers 
permitted the exchange of nutrients and metabolic products between the 
immobilized biofilm on the outside and the medium flowing within (Venkatadn and 
Irvine, 1993). The silicone membrane reactor used by Venkatadri and Irvine (1993) 
consisted of 15 feet of silicone tubing 
wrapped 
around 
five 
stainless 
steel rods in a stirred 
tank reactor and submerged in 1.5 L of growth medium. Presswizing air through one end 
of the tubing, with the other end sealed, 
transferred 
oxygen across the 
walls 
to the 
cells 
immobilized on the 
outside 
wall of the tubing and the buk liquid phase. 
The inherent advantages of 
such 
processes include the preference of the 
fimgi 
to 
grow attached to surfaces, lack of mechanicd shear and increased mass and oxygen 
transfer. Some 
examples 
of 
fixed 
growth bioreactor processes are listed in Table 2.6. Table 2.6 Examples of fured growth bioreactor processes with white rot fungi

The 
physical and chernical methods currently used to decolorize textile industry 
effluent face a nurnber of limitations, including high cost and inability to decolonze the 
broad range of dyes. 
Attempts 
to develop biodecoloration processes have 
largely 
focused 
on bactenal cultures and have, in 
general, been unsuccessful. 
The white rot fimgi have been shown to be capable of degrading several 
recalcitrant 
organo-pollutants. 
Most of 
these 
studies have been limited to 
P.chrysosporium. Some of the factors that have prevented the application of this 
organisrn 
in bioremediation processes are the high temperature (37°C) and static culture 
conditions required for the activity of its lignin-degrading enzymes. 
Most studies of dye decoloration have also been limited to P.chrysosporium. 
Comprehensive studies examining dye decoloration by different species of white rot 
fhgi 
are required to assess the potential of these organisms for a biodecoloration 
process. Chapter 3 
The evaluation of white rot fungi in the decoloration of textile 
dyes 
Abstract 
Of the five species of white rot fimgi evaluated for their ability to decolorize Arnaranth, 
Remazol Black B, Remazol Orange, Remazol Bnlliant Blue, Reactive Blue and 
Tropaeolin O in agar plates, Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, Phanerochaeîe chrysospwium, and 
Trametes versicolor displayed the greatest extent of decoloration in a nine day period. In 
static, aqueous culture, the three cultures forrned fimgal mats which did not decolonze 
any dye beyond some mycelial sorption. When agitated at 200 rpm, the biomass grew as 
mycelial pellets. Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 pellets decolonzed only Arnaranth, Remazol 
Black B, and Remazol Orange. Ph. chrysosporium and T. versicolor pellets were capable 
of decolorizing most dyes, with decoloration by î. versicolor being several times more 
rapid. 
Batch 
cultures of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 and Ph. chrysosporium had a limited 
ability to decolorize repeated dye additions. However, 
batch 
cultures of T. versicolor 
rapidly decolorized repeated additions of the different dyes and dye mixtures, without any 
visual sorption of any dye to the pellets. The choice of buffer had a profound effect on pH 
stability upon dye addition, and consequently, decoloration. The use of 2,2'- dimethyl 
succinic acid allowed for excellent pH control and resulted in elevated decoloration 
abililty. 
The major part of this chapter is a paper submitted for publication in 
Enzyme and Microbial TechnoZogy 3.1 Introduction 
A suitable organism for a biodecoloration process should decolorize a wide range 
of dyes and dye 
mixnires, as well as sustain decoloration for prolonged periods through 
repeated exposure 
to 
dyes. Previous 
studies 
on dye decoloration by white rot 
fungi 
have 
been limited to 
examining a single decoloration of one particular dye. Therefore, existing 
studies are inadequate to assess these organisms' suitability for a biodecoloration 
treatment 
process. 
Culture conditions have profound effects on physiology and the expression and 
activity of the ligninolytic enzymes by the white rot fhgi . A pH between 4.5 and 5.0 is 
optimal for degradative activity, with rnarked suppression above 5.5 and below 3.5 
(Happala and Linko, 1 993; Kirk et al., 1978; Mehna et al., 1995). Static culture 
conditions have been reported to be 
necessary 
for expression of the 
ligninolytic 
enzymes 
in T. versicolor and Ph. chrysosporizcm (Archibald 1992; Dodson et al., 1987; Johansson 
and Nyman, 1987; Roy and 
Archibald, 
1993), and have led to successful degradation of 
xenobiotic compounds by 
both 
species. However, agitated cultures of 
both Ph. 
chrysosporium (Michel et al., 1 99 1 ; Sayadi and El Iouz, 1 995) and T. versicolor 
(Archibald, 1990; Mehna et al., 1995) have been demonstrated to decolorize pulp and 
kraft mi11 effluent. 
The present work evaluates 
five 
white rot 
fùngi 
for 
their 
ability to decolorize six 
diverse dyes. The 
egects 
of buffer and agitation on decoloration by aqueous cultures of 
Bjerkandera sp. BOSSS, Ph. chrysosporium and T. versicolor are determined. Finally, the 
ability of 
batch 
cultures of these three species to decolorize individual dyes and dye mixtures upon repeated exposure is assessed in order to detemine their suitability for a 
decoloration process. 
3.2 Materials and Methods 
3.2.1 Culfures and cultzire maintenance 
P hanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-F- 1767, Trametes versicolor ATCC 20869, 
Trametes hirsuta, BjerWera sp. BOS55, and PZeurotus ostrentus were al1 maintained 
on 2 % malt agar plates at 4OC. Trametes versicolor was provided by Dr. Fredenck 
Archibald , Pulp and Paper Research Institute of Canada, and al1 other cultures, by Dr. 
David Boyle, Maritime 
Microbiologicals. 
3.2.2 Dyes and monitoring of decoloration 
The dyes used in this study, listed in Table 3.1, include cornrnercially significant 
dyes 
from 
different dye classes. Decoloration in solid medium was assessed by the visual 
disappearance of colour from the plates. Decoloration in liquid medium could be seen 
visually and was measured spectrophotometrically at the maximum visible wavelength of 
absorbance for each of the dyes (Table 3.1 ). 
3.2.3 Solid p lafe deco lorat ion studies 
Solid medium in Petri plates were prepared in Kirk's medium (Kirk et al., 1978) 
with 1.5 %(w/v) aga, and an aliquot of an individual dye to a final concentration of 100 
ppm. Plates, each containing one of the dyes, and a control plate with no dye added, were 
inoculated with one of the cultures listed above. They were incubated at 30°C, except for 
those 
inoculated with P. chrysosporiurn, which were incubated at 37OC. The plates were 
incubated for 10 days. Uninoculated plates 
served as controls for abiotic decoloration. 
The experiment was performed in duplicate for each culture. Table 3.1 Structures and maxirnum visible wavelengths of dyes

Five buKers were studied for their ability to maintain a constant pH during growth 
and decoloration in liquid culture: 20 m. sodium acetate, 20 mM citrate-phosphate, 20 
mM sodium tartrate, 20 mM dimethyl succinate (DMS) and 2,2'-dimethyl succinate 
(2,2'-DMS). Batch cultures of T.versicolor were grown in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks 
containing 200 ml of Kirk's medium, buffered to pH 5.0 with one of the buffers. 
Inoculated 
flasks 
were incubated at 3O"C and 200 rpm. On day 4, after sufficient biomass 
growth, an aliquot of one dye was added to a flask at the final concentrations shown: 50 
ppm Amaranth, 60 pprn Remazol Black B, 60 pprn Remazol Orange, 40 pprn Remazol 
Brilliant

Bjerkandera sp.BOS55 
Batch decoloration studies with Ph. chrysosporium. T. versicolor, and 
Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 were perfomed in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml 
of Kirk's medium buffered with 2,2'-DMS. T. versicolor and Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 
were incubated at 30°C, and P. chrysosporium at 37°C. One set of flasks was incubated 
under 
static conditions, and the other, at 200 rpm on a rotary shaker bath. On day 4, an 
aliquot of one of the dyes was added to the final concentration shown: 50 pprn Arnaranth, 
60 pprn Remazol Black, 20 pprn Tropaeolin 0,60 pprn Remazol Orange, 40 pprn 
Remazol 
Brilliant 
Blue R and 20 pprn Reactive Blue. Uninoculated flasks served as 
controls for abiotic decoloration. 3.2.6 Aqueous culture sequential decoloration studies 
Sequential decoloration studies were 
performed with Bjerknndera sp. BOSS, Ph. 
chrysosporiurn, and T. versicolor. 500 ml Erlenrneyer flasks containing 200 ml of Kirk's 
medium, buffered with 2,2'-DMS, were inoculated with one of the cultures, and 
incubated at 200 rpm and 30°C. On day 4, the first aiiquot of dye was added to al1 Basks. 
After the thorough decoloration of each dye, a subsequent aiiquot was added to the flask. 
When any dye was not completely decolorized, dye addition was stopped. The dyes were 
added in the 
following 
order 
to the final concentrations 
shown: 
50 ppm Amaranth, 60 
pprn Remazol Black, 60 pprn Remazol Orange, 20 pprn Tropaeolin 0,20 pprn Reactive 
Blue, and a mixture containing 30 pprn Remazol Orange, 30 pprn Remazol Black B, and 
20 pprn Reactive Blue. This order of addition was based upon the relative ease of 
decoloration for each dye as observed during decoloration of individual aiiquots. 
Al1 
experirnents in 
this 
study 
were performed in duplicate in 
order 
to

arnong triplicate values for readings was always between 1 to 5%. 
3.3 Results and Discussion 
3.3.1 Agar plate screening 
Initial evaluation of dye decoloration was done using solid medium. By day 4, 
the extent of mycelial growth on the agar plates was comparable for al1 cultures whether 
or not any dye was present. Decoloration began with She formation of clear zones around 
the colonies. Complete decoloration 
was 
assessed as the total disappearance of color fkom the medium, without any visible sorption to the biomass. Pl. ostreatlls did not 
decolonze any of the dyes tested. In a 10 day period, Bjerknndera sp. BOS55 and T. 
versicolor decolorized the maximum nurnber of dyes to the greatest extent (Table 3.2). 
Amaranth and Remazol Black B were completely decolorized, while there were faint 
traces of colour on the Remazol Orange and Tropaeolin O plates. The phthalocyanine 
dye, Reactive Blue, was almost completely decolorized by T. versicolor, while regions of 
strong colour remained in plates with Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 Although Ph. 
chysosporium and T. hirsuto decolorized Arnaranth and Remazol Black by day 10. 
Reactive Blue and Tropaeolin O were only faintly decolorized on the agar surface around 
the colonies. Neither culture decolorized Remazol Orange.

3.3.2.1 Effect of bl%fer and pH on decoloration by T. versicolor 
Five buf'fers, al1 previously used in culture medium for white rot fhgi (Kirk et al., 
1978; Haapala and Linko, 1993) were studied for their ability to provide adequate pH control during growth and dye decoloration. Due to the nurnber of buffen to be tested, 
this 
study was performed initially with only T. versicolor. A suitable buffer was to be 
chosen 
based 
on 
its 
ability 
to 
maintain 
a pH of 5.0, while permitting the decoloration of 
each dye, both as the first dye or as a second dye. The decoloration of the second dye 
was 
used to determine whether there might be changes in pH during repeated 
decolorations. 
In 
preliminary 
aqueous 
studies. Amaranth was consistently decolorized the rnost 
rapidly of al1 the dyes, and hence, its decoloration used in the initial evaluation. In the 
absence of dye, changes in pH due to growth alone were minimal with ali buffers (Table 
3.3). After 4 days of growth, 50 ppm of Amaranth was added to each flask. In al1 cases, 
there was little change in pH, 15 minutes following dye addition. However, in medium 
buffered with citrate-phosphate and sodium tartrate, the pH increased to 6.8 and 7.7, 
respectively, within 34 hours. This may have caused the observed fragmenting of 
mycelial 
pellets, with lytic products possibly contributing to the pH increase. There was 
no decoloration under these conditions. In addition, citrate and tartrate were consurned 
by T.versicolor for growth in Kirk's medium with either buffer as the sole carbon source 
(i.e. 
no glucose was added to the medium). These two buffers were considered to be 
unsuitable 
and 
no 
Further 
studies were 
performed 
with either. 
Since Arnaranth was thoroughly decolorized in medium buffered with DMS, 
sodium acetate or 2,T-DMS (Table 3.3), decoloration of the other dyes was examined 
with these buffers. No growth \vas observed in medium with any of these buffers as the 
sole carbon source. With DMS, a pH of 5.0 was maintained pnor to and 15 minutes der 
dye addition. However, the pH decreased to between 3.2 and 3.9 within 24 hours of adding Amaranth or any other dye (Table 3.4). In spite of this decrease, there was 
complete decoloration of Arnaranth and Remazol Black as well as 64 and 87% 
decoloration of Reactive Blue and Remazol Blue, respectively (Table 3.4). However, 
there was no decoloration of Remazol Orange or Tropaeolin O. Within 24 hours of the 
addition of either of these dyes, there was hgmentation of the mycelid pellets, which 
was 
not observed with the addition of any of the other dyes. Both sodium acetate and 
2,2'-DMS maintained a pH around 5.0 prior to, 15 minutes and 24 hours after dye 
addition, and dl dyes were decolorized.

When sodium acetate, DMS and 2,2'-DMS were evaluated for pH control during 
the decoloration of a second dye, each dye was added after Arnaranth was completely 
decolorized With sodium acetate, the pH drastically increased within 24 hours (Table 
3.4) and there was no decoloration. With DMS, no fûrther decrease in pH was observed 
regardless 
of which dye was added. Arnaranth and Remazol Black were çompletely 
decolorized. Although 
neither 
Remazol Orange nor Tropaeolin O was decolorized as a fim dye. both were decolorized when added as the second dye to Amaranth. Cultures 
buffered with 2,2'-DMS remained at pH 5.0 and completely decolorized al1 of the dyes 
added as second aliquots. 
When a pH change with dye addition resulted in no decoloration, there was 
always fragmentation of the mycelial pellets. Readjusting the pH to 5.0 at this point did 
not restore decoloration. This demonstrates the importance of pH control to decoloration. 
Since 2,2'-DMS provided good pH control and permitted decoloration of al1 the 
dyes, as a first or second dye, it was chosen for use in subsequent experiments. Later 
studies showed that this buffer maintained a pH of 5.0 during several dye and dye mixture 
decolorations by 
batch 
cultures of T. versicolor. 
The buffen used in this study were al1 organic acids with at Ieast one pK value 
close to 5.0, and, theoretically, should have each provided adequate pH control. In 
particular. 
both 
acetate and 
tartrate 
have been reported to buffer 
ligninolytic 
cuitures 
of 
Ph. chrysosporiurn more effectively than 2,2'-DMS (Haapala and Linko, 1993; Kirk et 
al., 1978). The ineffectiveness of citrate-phosphate and tartrate as buffers may have been, 
in part, due to their being consumed as a carbon source. Although acetate and DMS were 
not consumed by T. versicolor, their buffering capacity diminished upon dye addition 
The addition of 
organic 
molecules 
(Le. 
dyes) cm reduce the effectiveness of a buffer at 
any 
given pH. Since al1 buffers maintained a stable pH in non-decolorizing cultures, it 
appears that dye addition resulted in the loss of buffering capacity by ail buffers except Table 3.4 Comparison of 20 mM sodium acetate, 20 mM DMS, and 20 mM 2,2'-DMS for decoloration. Initial

chrysosporiurn and T. versicolor 
With 2,2'-DMS as the buffer, decoloration by the two most promising cultures 
from 
the 
agar 
plate 
screening, T. versicolor and Bjerkandera sp.BOS55, was studied. 
Ph. chrysosporiurn was included for cornparison purposes since its ability to decolorize 
dyes has been reported previously. 
3.3.3.1 Static vs. agitated culture conditions 
When one set of inoculated shake flasks waç incubated statically, the cultures 
formed 
filamentous 
"mats" at the surface of the 
growth 
medium by day 4. However, 
when a second set of flasks was incubated with rotary agitation at 200 rpm afler 
inoculation, 
uniform 
mycelial pellets, 2 to 3 mm in diarneter were formed. Dyes were 
added to 
both 
sets of 
flasks 
on day 4 (Table 3.5). With al1 statically grown cultures, 
decrease in dye absorbante was accompanied by visible sorption of the dyes to the fimgal 
mat. This has been previously reported in a study of dye decoloration by static cultures 
of different white rot fungi, including T. versicolor, (Heinfling et al., 1 997) and in several 
studies with Ph. chrysosporiurn (Bumpus and Brock, 1988; Cripps et al., 1990; Spadaro 
et al., 1992). In contrast, no myceliai sorption of dye was detected in agitated cultures. 
Agitated cultures of 
al1 
three 
species displayed greater decoloration ability than staticaily 
grown cultures (Table 3.5). For example, while static cultures of Bjerkondera sp. BOS55 
and T. versicolor decolonzed only 5 to 8 % of Amaranth in 20 days, agitated cultures 
completely decolorized the 
sarne 
amount 
within 24 hours. Furthemore, when a 10-day, statically grown culture of T. versicolor was agitated, the mycelial mat was transformed 
into pellets, and there was an increase in decoloration. Within 48 hours, there was 
complete decoloration of 
500 ppm Amaranth and 600 ppm Remazol Black B, of which 
only 5% and 13% , respectively, had been decolorized under stationary conditions over a 
six day period. However, 
while fûngal mats of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 and Ph. 
chrysosporium were also transformed into pellets when agitated, there was no 
accompanying 
decoloration of any dye. 
The superior performance of the agitated cultures may be due to the physiological 
state of the 
fungi as pellets and increased mass and oxygen transfer between the cells and 
the medium due to mixing. Biodegradation by white rot fungi has been attributed to the 
extracellular 
activity of oxidative enzymes (Field et al., 1993; Hamrnel, K.E., 1995; 
Morgan et ai.. 199 1 ; Reddy, A., 1995). These enzymes, in T. versicolor and Ph. 
chrysosporium, have been found to hction optimally at 100% O2 (Archibald et al., 
1990; Kirk et al.. 1978). The fonnation of a "mat" at the surface in static cultures 
restncts OZ transfer to the cells beneath the surface and in the medium. Oxygen limitation 
is likely to inhibit the oxidative enzymes and prevent decoloration. While static cultures 
of Ph. chrysosporium have been reported to decolorize dyes, without sorption, this has 
been with a large surface area to volume ratio (e.g. 10 ml of medium in 125 ml flask) and 
intermittent flushing with pure O2 (Bmpus and Brock, 1988; Cnpps et al., 1990; Glenn 
and Gold, 1983; Ollika et al., 1993; Paszczynski et al., 199 1; Spadaro et al., 1992). Although this approach alleviates O? limitation, it is impractical for the treatment of large 
volumes of effluent. 
The activity of some of 
these 
enzymes, 
such as lignin peroxidase and manganese 
peroxidase, 
requires 
a 
cell-associated Hz@ generating system (Orth et al., 1993; Reddy, 
1995; Zhao and hanse, 1996). Although these enzymes and associated components, such 
as HzO,. are present extracellularly, biobleaching studies with T. versicolor have show 
that 
they 
must be constantiy replenished fiom active biomass (Archibald, 1992a). 
Increased mass transfer becomes 
significant 
if decoloration requires 
such 
biomass- 
associated factors or if certain degradative enzymes are 
bound 
to the 
mycelium. 
Several 
studies with Ph. chrysosporium indicate that lignin has to bind to the fimgal wall 
for effective biodegradation (Krk and Farrell, 1987). If dye decoloration is similar, 
increased mass transfer may also 
allow 
for increased binding of the dye to pellets than to 
mats, and con~equently~ better decoloration. The larger surface area of pellets compared 
to that of a mat may also contribute to increased mass transfer. 
3.3.3.2 Decoloration of individuai dyes 
Although Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 displayed extensive decoloration on agar plates, 
decoloration in liquid culture was poorest with this species. Only Arnaranth was 
completely decolorized. Of the other dyes, 65% of Remazol Bdlimt Blue and 54% of 
Remazol Orange were decolorized. Amaranth, Tropaeolin O, Remazol Black B, and 
Remazol 
Orange were thoroughly 
decolonzed 
by Ph. chrysosporium and T. versicolor.

Ph. chrysosporium decolnrized 73% of Reactive Blue and 83% of Remazol Brilliant Blue 
aliquots in 19 and 1 1 days respectively, with no Mer reduction in color even by day 30. 
Although the extent of decoloration of al1 dyes was comparable for T.versicolor and Ph. 
chrysosporium. overall rates of decoloration were much higher with T. versicolor. For 
example, the longest penod for decoloration by T.versicoior was 7 days for the decoloration of Reactive Blue. which required 19 days for decoloration by Ph. 
chrysosporium. The shortest penod for decoloration by Ph. chrysosporium was 13 days 
for Amaranth, whic h was deco lorized in 24 hours by T. versicolor. T. versicolor displayed 
the greatest decoloration ability, both in 
tems 
of 
extent 
and 
rapidity 
of decoloration. 
In 
general, 
Arnaranth, 
Remazol Black B and Remazol Brilliant Blue were most rapidly 
decolorized 
by 
al1 three cultures. Decoloration of Tropaeolin 0, Remazol Orange and 
Reactive Blue by ail species took longer, and by Bjerkanderu sp. BOS55 and Ph. 
chrysosporium, was incomplete. Decoloration of a dye requires the destruction of the 
chromophore. The slow rate of Reactive Blue decoloration may be attnbuted to the 
complexity of the phthaiocyanine chromophore. However, the relative rates of 
decoloration for the four 
azo 
dyes 
cannot 
be 
easily 
explained. In this 
study, 
the smallest 
of the 
azo 
dyes, Tropaeolin O, took longer to decolorize than the larger Amaranth and 
Remazol Black molecules. The rate of decoloration for Tropaeolin O decoloration was 
comparable to that of Remazol Orange, a rnuch larger and more complex molecule (Table 
3.1). In general, the overall complexity of structure alone is not an indicator of the 
difficulty 
of decoloration of a 
particular 
dye (Shaul et al., 199 1 ; Shukla and Pandey, 
199 1 ). An early step in azo dye decoloration is the breaking of the azo bond, the ease of 
which 
has 
been found to 
depend 
on the identity, 
nurnber and position of functional groups 
in the aromatic 
region 
and the resulting interactions with the azo bond (Mechsner and 
Wuhrrnann, 1982). Further degradation of the azo dyes involves aromatic cleavage, 
which 
has 
also been found to be dependent on the identity of the ring 
substituents, Table 3.6 Sequent ial decoloration by batch cultures of Bjerkaridera sp. BOSS, Ph. chrysosporiuni and T. versicalor 
in a 20 day prriod. Each culture was challengrd with successive dye additions, until decoloration ceased.

3.3.3.3 Sequential decoloration of repeated additions of dye 
When challenged with subsequent additions of dye following complete 
decoloration of the 
first dye, Bjerknndera sp. BOS55 and Ph. chrysosporium displayed 
limited capacity for sequential decoloration (Table 3.6). Both cultures thoroughly 
decolorized Remazol Black following the decoloration of Amaranth, but failed to 
decolorize a subsequent addition of Remazol Orange, which had been decolorized 100 % 
and 54 % by Ph. chtysosporium and Bjerkandera sp. BOSS, respectively. as a first dye. 
However, T. versicolor sustained high rates of decoloration of sequential additions of the 
different dyes, including a dye mixture (Table 3.6). The eventual cessation of 
decoloration by 7'. versicolor is likely due to nutrient depletion in the cultures. This is 
being further investigated. 
Physiological differences among the three cultures (Field et al., 1993; Orth et al., 
1993; Reddy, A., 1995) and the decoloration enzymes may account for differences in 
decoloration 
ability. 
The complex enzymatic systems responsible for 
organo-pollutant 
degradation and the conditions under which they are expressed Vary among the white rot 
fûngi 
(Blanchette et al., 1989; Field et al., 1993; Orth et ai., 1993; Perez and lefies, 
1990). While the enzymatic systems of the white rot hgi have not been fùlly 
characterized, 
(Field et al., 1993; Orth et al., 1993) al1 three organisms are known to produce lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase. Bjerknndeeu sp. BOS55 aiso 
produces 
a manganese-independent peroxidase, and T.versicolor, the laccases. Since the 
laccases have been shown to be involved in the biobleaching of pulp effluent by 
T. versicolor (Roy-Arcand and Archibald, 1991), they may dso play an important role in 
dye decoloration, with possible contributions by unknown enzymes. The presence and 
roles of the different enzymes in decolonzing cultures of T.versicolor is currently being 
investigated in 
our 
laboratory. 
3.4 Conclusions 
Of al1 the organisms studied, T. versicolor displayed the greatest extent and 
rapidity of decoloration in aqueous cuiture. Decoloration required culture agitation and 
adequate pH control, with the choice of buffer being critical. To our knowledge, this is 
the first study to demonstrate the sequentiai decoloration of commercially important dyes 
and mixtures by T. versicolor. The results of this snidy show that T. versicolor has 
potential for use in a treatment process for dye-contarninated emuents. Future work will 
focus on characterizing this decoloration process. Chapter 4 
Effects of Carbon and Nitrogen Concentrations on Sequential 
Dye Decolo ra tion by Trametes versicolor 
Abstract: Batch cultures of Trametes versicolor myceiial pellets, grown at initiai 
glucose and ammonium concentrations of 10 g/L, (56 mM) and 0.442 g/L (! -2mM) 
respectively, decolorized successive additions of the sarne dye (Amaranth) and of 
different dyes and dye mixtures. Decoloration cornmenced at day 3 and al1 dyes were 
decolorized at 
high 
rates 
during 
the next 12 days. Glucose was consurned at a steady rate 
and 
was 
depleted by day 1 5. Dyes added after this time were decolonzed at decreased 
rates and decoloration ceased at day 18. Replenishing glucose concentrations to 5 glL 
restored high rates of decoloration. Fed-batch cultures maintained high rates of 
decoloration for 33 days, during which period glucose was replenished to prevent 
depletion. Decoloration ceased only 
der 
glucose was allowed to be depleted. Although 
decoloration required more than 0.13 g/L (0.73 mM) glucose, the glucose concentration 
did not 
affect 
the rate of decoloration. 
Decolorking 
cultures utilized glucose at a higher 
rate than those to which no dye was added. Ammonium was depleted at day 4 in both 
decolorizing cultures and 
those 
to which no dye was added. Decoloration required 
nitrogen limitation. Rapid decoloration 
was maintained at 0.442 g/L NH& but was 
inhibited in cultures kept at 4.42 g/L NH,'. When NH,& was increased fiom 0.442 g/L to 
4.42 giL in actively decolorizing cultures, decoloration ceased. This requirement 
The majority of this chapter is a paper submitted to Enzyme mid Microbial Technology for nitrogen-limitation has also been reported during decoloration by ligninolytic cultures 
of P. chrysosporium and suggests that decoloration by T.versicolor may be a similar 
process. 
However, 
the culture conditions used in this 
study 
repress 
ligninolysis 
and 
dye 
decoloration by P. chrysosporium. This indicates that the mechanism of dye decoloration 
by T.versico1or may be physiologically distinct from conventional lignin and pollutant 
degradation by P. chrysosporium. 
4.1 Introduction 
The ligninolytic enzymes of the white rot fhgi are thought to be expressed during 
secondary metabolism following growth when carbon andor nitrogen becomes lirniting 
(Boominathan and Reddy, 1 992; Bumpus, 1 985; Buswell, 1987; Kirk and Farrell, 1 987; 
Reddy, 1995). Neither lignin nor any pollutant degraded by these enzymes has been 
shown 
to be utilized as a growth substrate, and a separate carbon source is required for 
metabolic 
activity 
(Reddy, 1 995). 
To date, most of the research on lignin and organopollutant degradation has 
focused on Phanerochaete chrysosporiurn. The expression of lignin peroxidase (LiP) and 
manganese peroxidase (MnP) by this organisrn cm be viggered by carbon or nitrogen 
limitation (N-limitation) (Buswell, 
1987; 
Kirk 
and Farrell, 
1987; 
Reddy, 1995). Dye 
decoloration by P. chrysosporium has been shown to occur only after nitrogen depletion 
and to be poor in nitrogen-rich (N-rich) cultures, with substantial adsorption of the dyes 
to the 
mycelium 
(Bumpus and Brock, 
1988; 
Glenn and Gold, 1983; Spadaro et al., 1992). 
Since 
purified P.chrysosporium LiP and MnP can decolorize several dyes (Ollika et al., 
1993; Paszcynski et al., 1991) and inhibitors of Lignin degradation prevent decoloration 
(Glenn 
and 
Gold, 1983), the iigninolytic enzymes must play a role in this process. The expression of LiP by T. versicolor. like that by P.chrysosporium, requires N- 
limitation, stationary cultures, high O, partial pressure, and the addition of detergents and 
veratryl 
dcohol 
(Archibald, l992a; Dodson et d., 1987; Johansson et al., 1987; Jonsson 
et al., 1987). However, studies of BPE decoloration indicate that T. versicolor also 
produces 
degradative enzymes 
such as MnP and laccase in N-rich, agitated cultures 
without 
any 
detergent or 
veratryl 
alcohoi 
added (Archibald, 
1992a; 
Archibald, 
1992b; 
Roy and Archibald, 1993). Therefore, it has been proposed that lignin and poilutant 
degradation by T. versicolor are metabolic processes distinct fkom the conventionally- 
accepted, secondary metabolic 
lignin 
degrading system (Archibald, 1990; Roy, 1995). 
To date, there are no studies characterizhg dye decoloration by T. versicolor. In 
Chapter 3, it was shown that batch cultures of K versicolor decolorized a nurnber of dyes 
individually and upon repeated additions. This chapter investigates the effects of carbon 
(glucose) and nitrogen (ammonium) concentrations on the sequential decoloration of 
textile dyes by T. versicolor and addresses whether decoloration requires conditions of 
secondary metabolism. 
4.2 Materials and methods 
-1.2. I Cultzires and growth conditions 
Trametes 
versicolor ATCC 20869 was maintained on 2 % malt agar plates at 4°C. 
AI1 experiments were performed in autoclaved Kirk's medium (Kirk et al., 1978) at a pH 
of 5.0, with an initial glucose concentration of 10 g/L (56 mM glucose). The following 
trace elernents were added as a 10 x concentrate to a final concentration of (mgk): 3, 
MgS0,.7H20, 1, NaCI, MnS04.H20,0.5, CoSO,, 0.01 5, FeSO,. 7H,O, was ever added, served as biotic controls. There was no decoloration in the abiotic 
controls. 
The decoloration of repeated additions of (1) a single dye (50 pprn Ammth), 
and (2) of different dyes was examined. The dyes were added in the following order to 
the final concentrations shown: (A) 50 pprn Amaranth, (B) 60 pprn Remazol Black, (C) 
60 ppm Remazol Orange, (D) 20 pprn Tropaeolin O, (E) 60 pprn Reactive Blue, and (F) a 
mixture of 30 ppm Remazol Orange, 30 pprn Remazol Black and 20 pprn Reactive Blue. 
4.2 5 Fed- bat ch sequentiai decoloration stzrdies 
One-Litre-Erlenrneyer flasks, containing 400 ml of medium, were inoculated with 
30 ml portions of inoculum and incubated at 30°C and 200 rpm. Glucose concentrations 
were monitored daily, and replenished to 10 g/L on days 8, 15, and 24 with aliquots of a 
concentrated 1 M glucose stock solution. The dyes were added in the same order and 
concentrations as for the batch experiments. After the complete decoloration of these 
dyes, four mixtures of dyes were also added: (G) 30 pprn Remazol Black, 20 pprn 
Remazol Orange, 25 pprn Amaranth and 8 pprn Tropaeolin O, (H) 60 pprn Remazol 
Black and 20 pprn Reactive Blue, (1) 20 pprn Reactive Blue and 20 pprn Remazol Orange 
and (J) 60 pprn Rernazol Black, 20 pprn Remazol Orange and 8 pprn Tropaeolin O. After 
day 26, glucose was no longer replenished. 
4.2.6 Comparing decoloration by N-rich and N-lirnited cultures 
One-litre-Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 400 ml of either N-limited (0.442 g/L) or 
N-nch (4.42 g/L ammonium mate) medium, were inoculated with 30 ml portions of 
inoculurn and incubated at 30°C and 200 rpm. Glucose and NH,'concentrations were 
monitored daily, and maintained approximately at initial concentrations by replenishing with aliquots of 1 M glucose and 0.5 M ammonium tartrate solutions. On day 4, the first 
aliquot 
of Arnaranth was added to al1 flasks. A second aliquot of 50 ppm was added to N- 
rich cultures on day 5, afler which dye addition was stopped. Aliquots of 50 ppm 
Amaranth were added daily to the N-limited cultures fiom day 4 to day 9. On day 10, a 
mixture of 10 ppm of each dye was added to the flasks. On day 10, the concentration of 
NH4+ was increased from 0.442 g/L to 4.42 g/L in one set of N-limited flasks. The 
concentration of NH,' in the other set of N-limited flasks maintained at 0.442 g/L. 40 
ppm Remazol Red was added to al1 flasks. Four more additions of 40 ppm Remazol Red 
were made to the cultures maintained at 0.442 g/L NH,+. 
42.7 Sumpling and analytics 
4 ml samples were taken daily fiom each flask and replaced with 4 ml of mineral 
salts 
(Kirk's 
medium 
without 
glucose or nitrogen), resulting in a 1% change in the overall 
medium composition. Samples were centrifuged to remove suspended biomass and the 
concentrations of dye, glucose and NH,' in the supernatant were determined. 
Glucose was quantified using the 3,s- dinitrosalicylic acid test (Miller, 1958), and 
NH,* , by the phenol hypochlorite reaction (Weatherbwn, 1967).

4.3.1. I Decoloration of repeated additions of Amaranth in barch culture 
Batch cultures of I: versicolor decolorized 14 successive additions of 50 ppm 
Arnaranth (Fig. 4.1). Following the first addition of Amaranth on day 4, there was a lag 
of approximately 24 hours 
during 
which 
only about 35 % of the dye was decolorized. The 
remainder of the dye was rapidly decolorized during the next 24 hours. Five subsequent 
aliquots of Amaranth were each decolorized within 6 hours of being added. However. 
complete decoloration of the 
sixth 
aliquot, added on day 15, required 24 hours and less 
than 50% of the seventh aliquot, added on day 17, was decolonzed in 3 days. This 
decrease in decoloration rate coincided with glucose depletion at day 15. 
When glucose was replenished to 5 g/L on day 20, the remaining dye was rapidly 
decolorized and decoloration rates retumed to previous levels (Fig 4.1). Three Mer 
additions of Amaranth were rapidly decolorized, each within 6 hours. However, only 
60% of the final Amaranth aliquot, added on day 25, was decolorized in 4 days. Since 
sufficient 
glucose (2.98 g/L) was available, the decrease in decoloration rate at this time 
may have been due to the exhaustion of an essential nutrient or the accumulation of an 
inhibitory 
metabolite. 
4.3.1.2 Comparing sequential decoloration by batch and glucose-fed-butch cultures 
7'. versicolor decolorized sequential additions of different dyes and a dye mixture 
in 
batch 
culture (Fig. 4.2). The first dye, Amaranth, was decolorized in 48 hotus, with a 
lag period of about 24 hours as previously observed. Each of the 5 subsequent additions, Remazol Black Remazol Orange, Tropaeolin O, Reactive Blue, and a mixture of 
Remazol Black and Remazol Orange (B-F) was completely decolorized within 24 to 72 
hours. However, only approximately 25% of the mixture of Remazol Black, Remazol 
Orange and 
Amaranth (G) added on day 17 was decolorized by day 20. As before, 
decreased decoloration corresponded to glucose depletion by day 16 (Fig.4.2) and was 
restored by replenishing glucose to 5 g/L on day 20. The next dye mixture, Remazol 
Black and Reactive Blue (H), added on day 23, was decolorized within 48 hours. 
However, less than 30% of mixture (1) was decolorized in 6 days, again coinciding with 
glucose depletion by day 24. 
High rates of decoloration were rnaintained for a considerably longer period by 
fed batch cultures in which glucose was replenished. Figure 4.3 shows the decoloration 
of sequential additions of the different dyes and dye mixtures by a fed batch culture, to 
which aliquots of glucose were added on days 8, 15, and 24 to prevent glucose depletion. 
The rates of decoloration for the individual dyes (additions A to F) were similar to those 
in 
batch 
culture (Figure 4.2, Figure 4.3). However, the mixture of Remazol Black and 
Remazol Orange (F), added on day 18, was completely decolorized within 48 hours, 
without any decrease in decoloration rate as observed in batch culture. Three additional 
dye mixtures of (G) Remazol Black, Remazol Orange, Amaranth and Tropaeolin O, (H) 
Rernazol Black and Reactive Blue, and (1) Remazol Orange and Reactive Blw were also 
rapidly decolorized (Fig 4.3). Glucose was not replenished after day 24 and was depleted 
by day 33. Coinciding with glucose depletion, less than 25% of the mixture of Remazol 
Orange and Tropaeolin O (0, added on day 33, was decolorized by day 40. Figure 4.2. Sequential dccoloration of different dyes and dye mixtures by batch cultures of T.versicolor

4.3.2.1 Cornparison of decoloration in N-limited vs. N- rich cultures 
The depletion of NH,' in batch and fed-batch cultures by day 6 (Figures 4.1,4.2, 
4.3) did not inhibit decoloration. To determine the effect of nitrogen concentration, 
sequential decoloration was examined in N- limited (0.442 g/L) and N- rich (4.42 g/L) 
batch cultures, with glucose levels maintained at approxirnately 10 g/L. Aliquots of 
Amaranth were added to both sets of cultures on day 4. The first aliquot was completely 
decolonzed by both N-limited and N-rich cultures within 48 hours, with the characteristic 
24 
hour 
lag 
period. 
However, in N-rich cultures, even at 8 days following the addition of 
the second Amaranth aliquot, there was only 27% color removal from the medium, with 
mycelial sorption contributing substantially to color removal. In contrast, 6 Amaranth 
diquots and a mixture of 1 O ppm each of Arnaranth, Remazol Black, Remazol Orange, 
Reactive Blue, and Tropaeolin O were rapidly decolonzed in N- limited cultures. 
Increasing NH,' levels in N-limited cultures from 0.442 g/L to 4.42 gL on day 10 
quickly inhibited decoloration of the next aliquot of Remazol Red. There was strong 
mycelial sorption of the dye, with no decoloration even after 10 days. Cultures 
maintained 
at 1.2 mM NH,* rapidly decolorized 4 subsequent additions of 40 ppm 
Remazol Red. 
43.3 Cornparison of glucose and nitrogen consumption in decolorizing vs. non- 
decolor izing czrltures 
Glucose and NH,* consumption in decolorizing batch cultures were compared to îhat in 
batch cultures to which no dye was ever added. Although the rate of NH,' consumption 
was the sarne, glucose was consumed at a higher rate by decolorizing cultures (Fig. 4.4). Glucose was depleted by day 15 in cultures decolorizing repeated additions of Amaranth. 
When no dye was presenk glucose, consurned for growth and metabolic activity alone, 
was not depleted until day 20. This indicates additional consurnption of the primary 
growth 
substrate 
during 
decoloration. 
4.4 Discussion 
It is conventionally accepted that carbon (C) andor nitrogen (N) limitation 
triggers 
ligninolytic 
activity in white rot fhgi and is required for poliutant degradation. 
The present 
study 
examines the effects of 
carbon 
and 
nitrogen 
concentrations on 
sequentiai dye and 
mixture 
decoloration by T. versicolor. 
Decoloration was not stimulated by C-limitation. Several factors indicate that dye 
decoloration required an adequate amount of glucose. The cessation of decoloration after 
successive dye decolorations corresponded to glucose depletion. Decoloration was 
restored by replenishing glucose. Glucose-fed-batch cultures maintained high rates of 
decoloration for more than twice as long as batch cultures. Furthemore. decolorizing 
cultures consumed glucose at higher rates than those to which no dye was added. 
A cntical glucose concentration between 0.1 and 0.3 g/L was required for 
decoloration (Fig. 4.1, Fig. 4.2). At concentrations below this value, decoloration rates 
rapidly declined, with essentially no decoloration at O g/L glucose (Fig. 4.1, Fig. 4.2). Figure 4.4. Cornparison of glucose and ammonium consumption by T.versicolor during growth with no - -

Decoloration was found to follow pseudo first-order kinetics with respect to Amaranth 
concentration (Table 4.1 ). Plots of ln(C ,-& ,-* ,,,), C,,, = concentration of 
Arnaranth (ppm), as a function of time (hours), were straight lines, with correlation 
coefficients 
of 0.99. The rate of decoloration did not increase with glucose levels above 
the 
critical 
concentration, reflected by similar rate constants (Table 4.1). Below the 
cntical glucose concentration, the first order rate constant declined with decreasing 
glucose concentrations. 
During BPE decoloration, which occurs during primary metabolism, the extent of 
decoloration was found to increase with carbon concentration (Mehna et al., 1995; 
Archibald et al., 1990). It is unlikely that increased glucose consumption during dye 
decoloration reflects 
similar 
heightened metabolic activity. The requirement for N- 
limitation is characteristic of secondary metabolism, when metabolic activity is low. 
Based 
on the results, the requirement for glucose may be associated with a rate-limiting 
step. Possible roles for glucose in decoloration rnay include (i) the generation of H,O, required for extracellular peroxidase activity and/or (ii) the generation of ~n" 
complexing agents necessary for MnP activity. 
The activity of the extracellular peroxidases, such as LiP and MnP, requires H,O, 
as a CO-substrate (Orth et al., 1993; Reddy, 1995; Zhao and hanse, 1996). In many 
species of white rot fungi, enzymes such as glucose- 1 -0xidase and glucose-2-oxidase, are 
responsible for H,O, generation and are expressed as a part of the lignin degrading 
system. 
Glucosed-oxidase 
(pyranose 
oxidase) 
is a constitutive enzyme in T versicolor 
(Daniel et al., 1994). The preferred substrate for this enzyme is D-glucose, the primary 
carbon source in this study. It is possible that glucose is the substrate for HzOz 
generation during decoloration. 
MnP plays a key role in T.versicolor BPE decoloration that may also extend to 
dye decoloration. 
Purified MnP fiom P.chrysosporium has been show to decolorize 
several 
dyes (Pasti-Grigsby et al., 1992). The Mn3+ ions generated by Md? bind to simple 
organic 
compounds to 
form 
complexes, which, in the presence of H,O,, perform non- 
specific oxidations. Roy and Archibaid (1 993) reported certain intemediates of 
T. versicolor glucose metabolism, such as oxalate, glyoxylate and Fumarate. to be highly 
effective Mn (III) ion-complexing agents. If MnP is involved in dye decoloration, glucose 
may be required as a precursor to such intermediates. Since small amounts of these 
intermediates 
are 
sufficient 
for MnP activity, this may explain the low minimum glucose 
concentration to 
maintain 
rapid 
decoloration. 
The requirement for N-limitation suggests that decoloration occurs during 
secondary metabolism. Since there was adequate glucose in N-rich, decoloration- 
inhibited 
cultures, the lack of decoloration was not due to glucose depletion. The expression of critical decoloration enzyrne(s) or factors appears to be inhibited in N-rich 
cuf tures. 
N-limitation is a key requirement for Iigninolytic enzyme production and 
degradative activity, including dye decoloration, by P.chrysosporiurn (Burnpus et al., 
1985; Hammel, 1995; Kirk and Farrell, 1987). As observed with T. versicolor in this 
study, 
substantial 
biomass 
adsorption of dye has been reported with decoloration- 
inhibited, 
N-nch 
cultures of P. chrysosporium. However, other than the requirement for 
N-limitation, 
similarities 
between dye decoloration by P.chrysosporium and T. versicolor 
were limited. Under the culture conditions employed in this study, N-limited batch 
cultures of P. chrysosporium did not decolorize the range of dyes decolorized by 
T. versicolor and had limited ability to decolorize successive dye additions (Chapter 3). 
Dye decoloration by P. chrysosporium reportedly requires static culture conditions, high 
O2 partial pressure, and the addition of veratryl alcohol and detergents, al1 of which favor 
the expression and activity of the ligninolytic enzymes in this organism (Archibald, 
l99îa; Dodson et al., 1987). 
Despite certain similiarities, dye decoloration and BPE decoloration by 
T. versicolor appear to be govemed by distinct processes Like dye decoloration, BPE 
decoloration by T. versicolor also requires adequate supplies of carbon, with no 
decoloration in the absence of a primary carbon source (Archibald, 1990; Livemoche et 
al., 
1983; 
Mehna et al., 1995; Royer et al., 1 985). Mixing and aeration conditions used in 
this study were 
similar 
to 
those 
used in BPE decoloration (Addleman et al., 1995; 
Addleman and Archibald, 1993; Archibald, 1 990; Mehna et al., 1995; Roy and Archibdd, 
1993). However, an important difference is the requirernent of N-limitation for dye decoloration, which implies differences in the enzymatic mechanisms governing the two 
processes. 
4.5 Conclusions 
Sequential dye decoloration by T. versicolor required adequate supplies of 
glucose. However, 
above 
a low 
critical 
concentration. the rate of decoloration was 
unaffected by increases in glucose levels. The requirement for glucose appears to be 
associated with a rate-limiting step in the decoloration mechanism, rather dian heightened 
metabolic activity. The inhibition of decoloration in N-rich cultures suggests that 
decoloration 
occurs during secondary metabolism, distinguishing dye decoloration by 
from the well-studied process of T. versicolor BPE decoloration. Identification of the 
enzymes involved in decoloration is necessary to understand the requirement for N- 
limitation. Chapter 5 
Effects of Mn2' and nitrogen concentrations on enzyme 
production and sequential dye decoloration by Trametes 
versicolor 
Abstract: During the decoloration of the azo dye, Amaranth, by batch cultures of 
T. versicolor, no extracellular lignin peroxidase (LiP) was detected under any of the 
expenmental conditions. At an initial Ah2+ concentration of 3pM, N-limited (1 -2 mM 
NHJ cultures produced maximum extracellular concentrations of 60 U/L MnP and 1400 
UL laccase and decolorized 8 successive additions of Amaranth. Augmenting the initial 
~n"concentration 
to 200 pM increased the maximum Mn. concentration to 720 Un 
and decreased the maximum laccase concentration to 850 U/L, but did not affect the rate 
or number of successive Arnaranth decolorations. At an initial concentration of 200 pM 
~n", approximately twice as much laccase and MnP was produced by decolorking 
cultures as by those to which no dye was added. There was always a lag period of 6 to 8 
hours pnor to decoloration of the first aliquot of Amaranth, regardless of MnP and 
laccase 
concentrations. 
Although 
nitrogen-rich (1 2 mM NH,' ) cultures at an initial 
concentration of 200 pM ~n" produced higher maximum laccase and MnP levels of 
1 8 10 U/L and 1 150 U/L respectively, decoloration was reduced, with substantial myceliai 
sorption of the dye. 
The major part of this chapter is a paper in preparation for Applied Microbiology and 
Biotechnology While the results did not preclude a role for MnP or laccase in decoloration, extracellular 
MnP and laccase alone were insufficient for decoloration. The cell-fiee supernatant was 
incapable of decoloration. However, when the separated biomass was resuspended in 
fresh 
medium, high rates of decoloration resumed quickly. A biomass-associated 
enzyme(s) 
or factor appears to be required. The 
requirement 
of 
nitrogen 
limitation for 
decoloration may be related to the expression of this 
enzyme(s). 
5.1 Introduction 
Studies on dye decoloration by white rot hgi have largely been focused on 
Phaneruchaete chrysosporium. Decoloration is attributed to its ligninolytic enzymes, 
which 
include 
LiP 
and MnP, but not the laccases. In the presence of H202 and veratryl 
alcohol, 
purified P. chrysosporium LiP ha been shown to degrade several azo, triphenyl 
methane, heterocyclic and polymeric dyes (Bumpus and Brock, 1988; Cripps et al., 1990; 
Ollika et al., 1993; Glenn and Gold, 1 983; Patsi-Grigsby et al., 1 992). Purified 
P. chrysosporium MnP has been demonstrated to degrade certain dyes, in particular, those 
poorly oxidized by LiP (Pasti-Gngsby et al., 1992). MnPs are the key enzymes in bleach 
plant effluent (BPE) decoloration by P.chrysosporiurn (Michel et ai., 199 1). N-limitation 
is required for the expression and activity of both LiP and MnP during decoloration by 
P.chrysosporium (Bumpus and Brock, 1988; Glenn and Gold, 1983; Spadaro et al., 1992). 
There are no similar studies on dye decoloration by T.versico1or. However, MnP 
and laccase play key roles in T.versicolor bleach plant effluent decoloration (Addleman et 
al., 1995; Paice et al., 1993) that may extend to dye decoloration. In contrat to 
P.chrysosporium, T. versicolor can express MnP and laccase in N-rich medium 
(Addleman and Archibald, 1993; Archibald, 1992a). The objectives of this work are to (i) investigate the production of LiP, Mn. and laccase by T. versicokw during sequential 
dye decoloration, 
(ii) 
investigate the effect of elevated MnP concentrations on 
decoloration, 
(iii) 
determine whether the 
requirement 
for N-limitation 
during 
decoloration 
(Chapter 4) is related to expression of the ligninolytic enzymes and (iv) assess whether 
decoloration is due to the 
activity 
of the 
extracellular 
enzymes. 
5.2 Materiab and Methods 
5.2.1 Culture maintenance and medium 
T. versicolor ATCC 20869 was maintained on 2% malt agar plates at 4°C. Al1 
studies 
were 
performed in autoclaved Kirk's medium (Kirk et al., 1978), at a pH of 5.0, 
with an initial glucose concentration of 10 g/L (56 mM). Ammonium tartrate was used as 
the nitrogen source. ~n'+ and NH,* concentrations were modified for the various 
experiments as described below. 
52.2 Prepara tion of inoculum 
T. versicolor fiom a malt agar plate was used to inoculate 200 ml of Kirk's 
medium in 500 ml Erlenrneyer flasks, which were incubated at 30°C and 200 rpm. Four- 
day-old pellets were used as an inoculum. 
5.2.3 Samphg 
Four ml sarnples were taken every 24 hours fiom each flask and replaced with 4 
ml of mineral salts (Kirk's medium without glucose or nitrogen), resulting in a 2% 
change in the 
overall 
medium composition. 
Sarnples 
were 
centnfuged 
to 
remove 
suspended biomass and concentrations of dye, glucose, NH,' , LiP, MnP and laccase in 
the supernatant were determined. 5.2.1 Eflect of ~n2+ concentration on enzyme production and sequential Amaranth 
decoloration &y N-limited and N-rich batch cultures 
N-rich (12 mM ammonium tartrate) and N-limited (1 -2 mM ammonium tartrate) 
Kirk's 
medium with 3 pM and 200 pM Mn2' were prepared with addition of the 
appropriate arnounts of MnSO,.H,O. Two hundred ml of medium, in 500 ml Erlenmeyer 
flasks, was inoculated with 30 ml portions of inoculum and incubated at 30°C and 200 
rpm. The first aliquot of 50 pprn Amaranth was added to al1 Basks on day 0. After each 
complete decoloration, a subsequent 50 ppm Arnaranth diquot was added to the flask. 
A set of N-limited and N-rich cultures with 200 FM ~n'+, to which no Amaranth 
was added, was maintained to compare enzyme production in the absence and presence of 
dye. 
Al1 
experiments in 
this 
study 
were 
performed 
in duplicate and the results are 
average values 
fiom 
triplicate readings. 
5.2.5 Decoloration of the firsr Amaranth aliquot added at dlferent rimes to barch culture 
Two hundred ml of N-limited medium with 3 pM Mn2+, in 500 ml Erlenmeyer 
flasks, 
was 
inoculated with 30 ml portions of the inoculum culture. The first aiiquot of 50 
ppm Amaranth was added to the cultures on either day 4, day 9, day 12 or day 14. 
Following the complete decoloration of the first aliquot, two more 50 pprn aliquots were 
added to each flask. 
5.2.6 Decoloration by the whole broth, cell-free supernatanr and resuspended biornass 
Two hundred ml of N-limited medium with 3 FM Mn2+, in 500 ml Erlenmeyer 
flasks, was inoculated with 30 ml portions of the inoculum culture. On day 0, 50 ppm 
Arnaranth was added to al1 flasks. Following complete decoloration of the first aliquot, a subsequent aliquot was added on day 7. On day 9, the contents of one set of flasks were 
centrifuged 
to 
separate 
the biomass fiom the medium. The biomass was resuspended in 
200 ml of Fresh N-limited Kirk's medium with 3 FM M& The supematant was filtered 
through a 2 1 Fm filter. Fifty ppm Arnaranth was added to the 9 day old cultures, the 
resuspended biomass and the 
cell-fee 
supematant and al1 flasks were incubated at 30°C 
and 200 rpm. 
5.2.7 Analyrics 
Glucose was quantified using the 33- dinitrosalicylic acid test (Miller, 1 TB), and 
NH,' , by the phenol hypochlonte reaction (Weatherburn, 1967). 
Laccase concentrations were measured by monitoring the oxidation of 2,2'- 
azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) at 420 nrn. One unit of activity 
equalled 1 pM ABTS oxidized per minute at 25°C and pH 5.0. LiP activity was 
measured by monitoring the oxidation of 2mM veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde at 3 10 
nm with O. I mh4 HzO, in 100 mM tartrate buffer (pH 3 .O) (Molar extinction coefficient. 
9,300 M-' cm-'). One unit of activity equalled 1 pM veratryl alcohol oxidized per minute 
at 25°C. MnP activity was measured by monitoring change in optical density due to the 
formation of malonate-~n" complex at 270 nm with 50 rnM Na malonate (pH 4.3, 0.2 
mM MnSO, and 0.1 rnM H202. 
Al1 experiments in this study were performed in duplicate in order to confirm 
trends 
under 
given sets of conditions. Since slightly different amounts of biomass were 
present in each 
flask, 
results From duplicate flasks were not averaged. The results 
presented are fkom one flask are average values fiom triplicate readings. The error 
among 
triplicate values for readings was always between 1 to 5%. 5.3 Results 
5.3.1 Induction of decoloration 
A characteristic lag phase of approximately 6 to 8 hours was observed during the 
decoloration of the 
first 
addition of Amaranth, regardless of the day on which it was 
added (Table 5.1). The first aliquot was decolorized at rates from 1.2 to 1.5 ppm/h, with 
complete decoloration requiring approximately 48 hours. Subsequent aliquots were 
decolorized at rates between 8.3 to 9.0 ppm/h, with complete decoloration in 
approximately 6 hours. 
5.3.2 Efleci of ~n~+ on N-limitai cultures 
In cultures with initial concentrations of 56 rnM (10 g/L) glucose, 1.2 mM (0.442 
giL) NH,' and 3 pM ~n", glucose was consumed at a steady rate and exhausted by day 
16 (Figure 5.1). NH,' was depleted by day 6 (Figure 5.1). Decoloration of the first 
aliquot of 50 ppm 
Amaranth, 
added on day 0, cornmenced on day 2 and was completed 
by day 4. No LiP was detected at any time. The production of laccase and MnP was 
detected by day 2, and achieved maximum levels of 1400 U/L Iaccase on day 12 and 60 
UIL MnP on day 16 (Table 5.2). 
At an initial concentration of 200 pM ~n", glucose and NH,+ were consumed at a 
slightly higher rate than at 3 FM ~n'+ and were exhausted by days 15 and 4, respectively 
(Figure 5.2). Decoloration of the first aliquot of 50 ppm Arnaranth, added on day 0, 
commenced on day 2 and was completed by day 4. No LiP was detected at any time. 
Laccase 
and MnP production was detected by day 2. More MnP was produced at 200 
PM, with a maximum of 720 U/L on day 1 1 (Table 5.2). However, the maximum level 
of laccase was comparatively lower at 850 U/L on day 8 (Table 5.2). Despite significant differences in enzyme production, both sets of cultures rapidly 
decolorized 8 successive additions of 
Amamth, 
with no difference in the 
extent 
or rate of 
decoloration (Table 5.2). Decoloration rates 
decreased 
and 
eventdly 
ceased upon 
glucose depletion, 
despite 
sufficient 
levels of 
laccase 
and MnP in the extracellular 
medium (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). 
5.3.3 Enzyme production in the absence of dye 
In the absence of dye, enzyme production by N-lirnited batch cultures at initial 
concentrations of 10 g/L glucose, 1.2 mM NH4-, and 200 pM ~n" was approximately 
half 
of 
that 
by 
decolorizing 
cultures, with maximum levels of 470 U/L MnP and 420 U/L 
laccase on day 12. 
In cultures with initial concentrations of 10 g/L glucose, 12 rnM NH,' and 200 
pM Mn", glucose was consurned at a steady rate and exhausted by day 16 (Figure 5.3). 
The NH,' concentration at this time was 5.59 mM (Figure 5.3). Enzyme production was 
detected at day 2, and reached maximum levels of 1 150 U5 MnP and 18 10 UL laccase 
on day 11. 
5.3.4 Effect of on decoloration by N-rich batch cultures 
N-nch cultures displayed Iimited ability for sequential decoloration (Table 5.2). 
The first two aliquots of Amaranth were completely decolorized, at approximately the 
same 
rate as by N-limited cultures. There was substantial sorption of the third aliquot to 
the biomass in cultures 
initially 
at 3 pM ~n", with no Mer decoloration of the 
biomass or the medium. Cultures 
initially 
at 200 pM ~n'+decolorized the third aliquot in 
approximately 48 hours. There was substantid sorption of the fourth diquot to the 
biomass, with no further decoloration of the medium or the biomass. At both Mn2+ concentrations, upon dye sorption, glucose consurnption and pellet formation ceased, 
suggesting an inhibition of Mer growth. Undecolorized Arnaranth in the medium 
prevented quantification of glucose, ammonium or the enzymes, as it interfered with ail 
colorimetnc 
assays. 
5-33 Decoloration by cell-fiee supernatant and biomass 
Two sets of N-limited cultures, at an initial concentration of 3 pM ~n", 
decolorized 50 ppm Amaranth added on day 4 and day 7. On day 9, one set was 
centrifuged to separate the biomass fiom the supernatant. This cell-fiee supernatant was 
incapable of decolorizing 50 pprn Amaranth. The separated biomass, resuspended in fresh 
medium, decolorized a third aiiquot within 24 hours, and 4 subsequent additions of 
Amaranth, each within 6 hours. The whole broth fiom the other set of cultures 
decolorized 5 Mer aliquots of Amaranth, each within 6 hours. 
5.4 Discussion 
In previouc work (chapters 3 and 4), T. versicolor decolonzed successive additions 
of different textile dyes and dye mixtures, indicating its suitability for a decoloration 
process to treat textile effluent. Identification of the decoloration enzymes is useful for 
the optimization of process parameters and medium composition to maximize their 
production and 
therefore, 
decoloration. Table 5.1 Decoloration of the first aliquot of Amaranth on day 4,9,12 or 14 by N-limited batch

tirnc (h) Under al1 experimental conditions in this study, extracellular MnP and laccase, 
but not 
LiP, 
were detected 
Since 
decolorizing, 
N-lirnited 
cultures produced 
approximately 
twice as much MnP and laccase as those to which no dye was added, these 
enzymes 
appear 
to be 
involved 
in decoloration. MnP and laccase are central to 
I: versicolor BPE decoloration and an MnP-deficient mutant of the organism used in our 
study (52J) was shown to display greatly reduced ability to decolorize the polymeric dyes 
poly-B4 1 1 and poly-R478 compared to the parent strain (Addleman et al., 1995). 
Furthemore, purified P. chrysosporium MnP can oxidize a number of dyes (Pasti-Grigsby 
et al., 1992). 
A strong correlation has been reported between MnP concentrations and the 
extent 
of BPE decoloration by T. versicoior (Addleman and Archibdd, 1 993). 
Augmenting the medium ~n" concentration in N-lirnited cultures from 3 pM to 200 FM 
increased MnP production and decreased laccase production. However, in contrast to 
BPE decoloration, the rate and number of Arnaranth decolorations were unaffected. 
N-limitation has been show to be a requirement for sustained dye decoloration 
by T. versico[or (chapter 4). The expression of the degradative enzymes by most species 
of white rot 
hgi 
requires N-limitation and is repressed in N-rich cultures (Reddy, 1995; 
Field et al., 1992). However, N-rich cultures produced higher levels of MnP and laccase 
than N-limited cultures. This clearly indicates that no decoloration at high N 
concentrations was not due to the absence of either of these enzymes. 
While the results do not preclude the involvement of extracellular MnP or laccase, 
several 
factors indicate that 
these 
enzymes 
alone 
were 
insufficient 
for decoloration. 
Decoloration by N-limited cultures ceased with glucose depletion, despite high extracellular concentrations of MnP and Iaccase. N-rich cultures and the cell-fiee 
supematant 
fiom 
N-limited 
cultures were incapable of decoloration 
aithough both 
contained high MnP and laccase concentrations. Furthemore, the fïrst addition of 
Amaranth was always decolorized at a lower rate, with a lag period of 6 to 8 hours, 
regardless of Md? and laccase concentrations at the ûme of dye addition. Subsequent 
aliquots 
were decolorized more rapidly. This 
implies that dye addition induces essential 
decoloration 
enzyme(s) 
or 
factor(s) 
other than MnP and laccase. 
That 
decoloration requires a biomass-associated component was suggested by (i) 
the lack of decoloration by the 
cell-fiee 
supematant 
despite high concentrations of laccase 
and MnP and (ii) high rates of decoloration by resuspended biomass. 
Substantial 
arnounts 
of dye were sorbed to the biomass in decoloration 
inhibited 
(N-rich) 
cultures and were not Wer decolorized. Lignin degradation has been show to 
require the binding of 
Iignin 
to the 
fimgal 
wall. A preliminary step in the decoioration 
mechanism may 
involve 
binding of the dye molecule to the myceliurn, perhaps for initial 
degradation by a biomass-associated enzyme(s). If the expression andfor activity of this 
enzyme is repressed at 
high 
nitrogen levels, 
there 
may be binding of the dye to the 
myceliurn, but with no or reduced decoloration. 
A possible biomass-associated product is H20L, a CO-substrate for oxidation by 
ligninolytic 
peroxidases. Glucose-2-oxidase 
(pyranose 
oxidase), a constitutive peroxidase 
in T.versicolor, is located in the penplasmic space between the ce11 membrane - ce11 wall, 
which is believed to be the site of H,O, production (Daniel et ai., 1994; Machida and 
Nankanishi, 1984). This enzyme's preferred substrate, D-glucose, was used as the carbon 
source in this 
study. 
Decoloration has been 
shown 
to require glucose (Chapter 4) and ceased with glucose depletion, even at substantial concentrations of MnP and laccase. If 
glucose-2-oxidase is the major source of H,O, for extracellular oxidation this may 
partially explain the requirement of both glucose and the biomass for decoloration. 
Since 
the rate of 
decoloration did not increase with increasing extracellular MnP 
and laccase levels, the rate lirniting step may either be H,O, generation or degradation by 
a biomass-açsociated e-e(s). The requirement for N-limitation suggests the 
involvement of LiP. That no extracellullar LiP was detected was not surprising as the 
culture conditions 
used 
in this study reportedly repress 
LiP 
production by T. versicolor. 
This culture is reported to also require stationary culture conditions, elevated headspace 
O2 partial pressure, low ~n" concentrations, veratryl alcohol to prevent inactivation by 
H,O, and surfactants such as Tween 20 to prevent enzyme aggregation for LiP production 
(Archibald, 
1992a; 
Archibald, 
l992b; 
Dodson et al., 1987; Johanson and Nyman, 1987). 
However, N-limited, agitated cultures of 7: versicolor degraded more than 50 % of the 
lignin 
degraded by N-limited, static cultures in an 8 day period (Waldner et al., 1988). 
Since LiP is central to lignin degradation, this implies some LiP production by agitated 
cultures. 
Irnrnunochemical 
methods have revealed 
that 
a fraction of the 
LiP 
produced by 
P. chqmsporiurn remains associated with the fungal wall (Garcia et al., 1987) and 
washed pellets have been shown to retain partial lignin-degrading ability (Kurek and 
Odier, 1990). The involvement of biomass-bound LiP in decoloration may explain the 
requirement for N-limitation, and in part, the biomass. 
5.5 Conclusions 
The rate and number of Arnaranth decolorations by N-limited cultures of 
T. versicolor was unaffected by changes in extracellular MnP and laccase concentrations. Several factors indicated that these two enzymes alone were insuficient for dye 
decoloration. A biomass-associated factor or enzyme, the expression of which may 
require N-limitation, appears to play a key role. Characterization of the biomass-bound 
enzymes or factors involved may elucidate the requirernent for N-limitation and the role 
of the biornass in decoloration. Chapter 6 
Conclusions 
To date, studies on dye decoloration by white rot fhgi have been largely confined 
to P.chrysosporiurn. In these studies, the successful decoloration of a single addition of a 
particular dye has been taken to indicate P.chrysosporium 's potential to treat dye- 
contaminated 
effluents. This work has shown that P. chrysosporium does not sustain 
decoloration upon repeated exposure to dyes, and is of 
limited use to treat the range of 
dyes 
found 
in textile effluents. 
The potential of T. versicolor to treat dye-contarninated effluents was established. 
Batch 
cultures of 7'. versicolor completely decolorized a range of cornrnercially important 
textile dyes, added 
individually 
and in various mixtures. The decoloration of successive 
dye additions was 
sustained 
for up to 30 days. To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
demonsirate the sequential decoloration of dyes and dyes 
mixtures by 7'. versicolor. 
Culture conditions for successful decoloration were established. The requirement 
for culture agitation, which resulted in the 
formation 
of 
mycelial 
pellets, was attributed to 
improved oxygen and mass transfer. This contrasts the conventional idea that static 
culture conditions are required for degradative 
activity 
by white rot 
fungi. A pH of 
approximately 5.0 was essential; the choice of buffer was critical. Of the five buffers 
tested, only 2,2'-dimethyl succinic acid controlled the pH through repeated decolorations. 
The effect of 
carbon 
and 
nitrogen 
concentrations on sequential decoloration were 
determined. Decoloration required adequate supplies of glucose. Lost decoloration 
ability in glucose-depleted cultures was restored by replenishing glucose. Above a critical 
concentration, the rate of Arnaranth decoloration did not increase with glucose 
concentration, and was fust-order with respect to Arnaranth concentration. Below this 
critical 
glucose concentration, the first order rate constant declined with decreasing 
amounts 
of glucose. The requirernent for glucose may be associated with HzOz production 
by glucose-2-oxidase or the generation of organic acids required by MnP. 
Decoloration required N-limitation. The lack of decoloration in N-rich cultures of 
white rot 
hgi is usually atüibuted to repressed expression of the ligninolytic enzymes. 
However, T.versicolor produced at least two ligninolytic enzymes, MnP and laccase, in 
both 
N-lirnited and N-rich cuihires. Therefore, it is clear that these enzymes alone are 
insufficient for 
decoloration. 
The rate and number of Amaranth decolorations by N-limited cultures was 
unaected by changes in extracellular MnP and laccase concentrations. Several factors 
indicate the requirement of a biomass-associated enzyme or factor for decoloration. It is 
possible that the biomass may be the site of HzOz generation by glucose-Zoxidase, 
accounting for the requirement of 
both the biomass and of glucose. Strong mycelial 
sorption of dye in 
N-rich (decoloration-inhibited) cultures suggests that a preliminary, 
rate limiting step may be 
mycelial 
binding of the dye, perhaps associated with initiai 
degradation. Characterization of the 
biomass-bound 
enzyme(s) 
or factors would elucidate 
the role of the biomass in decoloration. 
Dye decoloration by T. versicolor was physiologically distinct from a 
P.chrysosporium-type degradation system and the well-studied process of BPE 
decoloration by I: versicoior. Chapter 7 
Recomrnendations for future work 
7.1 The decoloration mechanism 
Further work is required to understand the role of extracellular laccase and MnP 
in decoloration. Detemining the effects of elevated MnP concentrations on the 
decoloration rates of different dyes and dye mixtures may chi@ its contribution to 
decoloration. If high MnP concentrations increase decoloration rates, culture conditions 
should be optimized to 
maximize MnP production. The decoloration ability of 
concentrated and purified MnP and laccase fiom the extracellular medium should be 
investigated. 
Determining 
the decoloration ability of MnP and laccase-deficient mutants 
for decoloration 
would 
Mer 
establish the roles for 
these 
enzymes in decoloration. 
The requirement of the biomass for decoloration must be examined. 
Reconstitution experiments 
exarnining 
whether exogenous H20L can drive decoloration 
by the cell-fiee medium, may determine whether the biomass generates Hz02 during 
decoloration. In initial experiments, reconstituting the cell-fiee medium with HzO, did 
not result in decoloration. However, 
since 
peroxidative 
activity 
is 
extremely sensitive to 
H,O,, the experiment should be repeated at very low concentrations of HzOz. 
The role of LiP in decoloration should be investigated. The veratryl alcohol- 
based 
assay 
for 
LiP has been shown to have low sensitivity and susceptibility to artifacts 
that absorb in the ultraviolet 
region 
(Archibald, 
1992a). 
Al1 
assays 
for 
LiP 
in 
this 
work 
were performed on the extracellular supernatant which contained metabolites and 
decoloration byproducts that absorbed in the ultraviolet region. Analysis for extracellular LiP should be performed on concentrated and purified preparations of the extracellular 
supernatant. The presence of biomass-associated 
LiP 
should also be 
investigated. 
It 
is 
critical 
to 
determine the toxicity of the decoloration byproducts. In initial 
toxicity assays with Zebra Fish, 100% mortality was observed in decolonzed medium 
with al1 dyes. However, since 100% mortality was also observed with Kirk's medium 
alone, 
it was not clear whether toxicity was due to a component in the medium or the 
decoloration products. 
Characterization of the 
decoloration 
byproducts is important to determine whether 
toxic 
cornpounds 
(i.e 
aromatic 
amines) are being generated. Attempts to identiQ 
decoloration products with an isocratic high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
system were unsuccessful. 
7.2 Scaling up the decoloration process 
Initial studies were performed with a bench-scale (2L) stirred tank reactor. The 
main problem encountered was the tendency of the biomass to adhere to surfaces such as 
the probes, baffles and the impeller. Decoloration was unafTected, as long as there was a 
sufficient 
amount 
of 
fiee 
pellets in the medium. 
Three 
successive dye additions were 
decolorized before 
al1 
the biomass was removed from suspension and completely adhered 
to surfaces. 
A possible configuration is a stirred tank reactor with the biomass imrnobilized on 
alginate, agarose or silicon beads, nylon cubes or polyurethane foam. This may permit 
culture agitation and pellet configuration while alleviating the tendency of the pellets to 
adhere to surfaces. It has been show that decoloration required adequate amounts of the prirnary 
carbon source, glucose. A large-scaie decoloration process would necessitate the 
examination of less-expensive alternatives. Several inexpensive substrates were show to 
be 
suitable 
for BPE decoloration by ïhersicolor (Archibaid et al., 1990). The suitability 
of some of 
these 
substrates for dye decoloration should be investigated. 
Similarly, the 
use of 2,2'-DMS as the buffer would be expensive in a large scale decoloration process. 
In a system with pH control, the use of a less expensive buffer may be possible. References
