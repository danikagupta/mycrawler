Research on environmental concentrations and processes of technology -critical 
elements (TCE) is gaining relevance in the recent years due to their increasing 
use in a variety of emerging technological applications (e.g. Cobelo -García et 
al. 2015). However, knowledge on their temporal evolution in anthropogenically  
impacted areas during the past century has not been well documented . To this 
aim, TCE (e.g. Ta, Te, Nb, Ga, Ge, In, Tl, Rare Earth Elements , platinum group 
elements) have been analyzed in a dated sediment core collected from a 
contaminated bay of Lake Geneva , Switzerland  in which a high degree of 
enrichment for ‘common’ (e.g. Pb, Cu, Hg, Ni) metals has already been reported 
(Gascón Díez et al. 2017). We observed a significant degree of contamination 
for several TCE (e.g. In, Te; Figure 1) following a trend similar to other co mmon 
metals , and linked to the implementation of the Lausanne city wastewater 
treatment plant discharging its treated and untreated effluent in the bay. For 
other TCE like Tl or Ge, low o r null contamination was found.
