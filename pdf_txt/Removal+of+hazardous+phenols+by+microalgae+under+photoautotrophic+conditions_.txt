Various algae were screened for their ability to decrease the concentration of 2,4-dinitrophenol
(DNP), as a model compound of hazardous phenols, under photoautotrophic conditions. Chlorella
fusca  var. vacuolata  and Anabaena variabilis  grew well and showed high DNP removal ability over
the concentration range of 5 to 40 /g109M. Their abilities to remove various phenols were investi-
gated. More than 90% of 40 /g109M o- and m-nitrophenol and DNP was removed during the cultiva-
tion period of 5 d. o-, p-Chlorophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol could be removed, but not to a sig-
nificant extent. C. fusca  also removed 85% of bisphenol A, suspected to be an endocrine disrupter.
It was found that microalgae would be applicable to the removal of hazardous phenols without
the addition of any organic carbon sources.
[Key words: green algae, cyanobacteria, nitrophenol, chlorophenol, bisphenol A, photoautotrophic conditions]
Microalgae have actually been used in tertiary treatment
processes for removing nitrogen and phosphorus from waste-
water (1) and have the potential to be used to remove vari-
ous pollutants, such as heavy metals (2) and NOx (3, 4).Phenol and its derivatives are commonly found in industrial
wastewater from the production of pharmaceuticals, agri-
cultural chemicals, dyes, and plastics (5–8). Phenol is known
to be toxic to fish at concentrations of 5 mg /g215l–1 to 25 mg /g215l–1
(9). It was also reported that nitrophenols and chlorophenols
are toxic to aquatic organisms over the same concentrationrange (10–12). The emission standard for phenols in indus-
trial effluent after wastewater treatment is set at 5 mg /g215l
–1 by
the Ministry of the Environment in Japan. In this study,
therefore, phenols at a concentration of 40 /g109M, approxi-
mately corresponding to the emission standard for phenols,were used. Some of the phenolic compounds are suspected
to be endocrine disrupters and have adverse effects on hu-
mans and other organisms in the natural ecosystem at con-centrations lower than the emission standard for phenols
(13–15). Therefore, the low concentrations of these phenols
need to be removed from industrial effluents for aquatic en-vironmental protection. If bacteria are used for the removal
of phenols from effluent, it is necessary to add an external
organic carbon source to maintain biomass and the ability toremove these compounds. On the contrary, as microalgae
use CO
2 as a carbon source, they can grow photoautotrophi-
cally without the addition of an organic carbon source. Wetherefore focused on the utilization of microalgae for re-
moving low concentrations of hazardous phenols from in-
dustrial effluents. The objective of this study was to obtainmicroalgae with the ability to remove various phenols at theconcentration of the emission standard under photoauto-
trophic conditions.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  IAM C-238, Chlorella ellip-
soidea  IAM C-87, Chlorella fusca  var. vacuolata  IAM C-28
(C. fusca ), and Chlorella sorokiniana  IAM C-212 were cul-
tivated in modified Bristol medium (16), the pH of which
was adjusted to 6.0. Carteria inversa  NIES 422, Chlamy-
domonas fasciata  NIES 437, and Chlamydomonas moe-
wusii  IAM C-259 were cultivated in C-medium (17), the pH
of which was adjusted to 7.5. Cyanobacteria, Anabaena cy-
lindrica  NIES19 and Anabaena variabilis  NIES23 were
cultivated
 in MDM  (16), in which  1.60 mg /g215l–1 Fe2(SO4)3/g215
nH2O and 4.32 mg /g215l–1 EDTA  were used instead  of FeSO4/g215
7H2O. The pH was adjusted to 7.5. Microcystis aeruginosa
f. aeruginosa  NIES 44 was cultivated in M-18 medium
(18), the pH of which was adjusted to 8.0. The strains were
pre-cultivated in the respective media at 27.5 /g176C under illumi-
nation with white fluorescent light (14 W /g215m–2), and aerated
with air containing 1% CO2. After 7 d, cells were harvested
by centrifugation (845 /g180g, 5 min, 15 /g176C). The cell pellet was
re-suspended in fresh medium and the optical density ofcells at 680 nm (OD
680) was adjusted to 1.0. For the re-
moval of nitrophenols including o-, m- and p-nitrophenol,
2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, and bis-phenol A [2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane], the cell sus-
pension (50 ml) was transferred into a 100-ml glass test
tube. Algal cells were cultivated under the same conditionsas those for pre-cultivation. For chlorophenols, including o-
and p-chlorophenol, and 2,4-dichlorophenol, a small closed-
type photobioreactor was used, because these compoundsare easily volatilized from the medium by aeration. The
photobioreactor consisted of a 100-ml Erlenmeyer flask
sealed with a silicon ru bber cap that was covered with alu-
minum foil. Algal cells were cultivated at 25 /g176C on an orbital

shaker for 120 h under illumination (14 W /g215m–2). The initial
concentration of phenols was adjusted to 40 /g109M. The cell
growth was evaluated by the OD680, which was measured
using a spectrophotometer (U-2000; Hitachi, Tokyo). The
concentrations of phenols were measured using a high per-formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (D-7000
series;
 Hitachi)  with a diode  array detector  (L-4500;
Hitachi) at 280 nm using a reversed-phase column(Mightysil RP-18 GP250-4.6; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo).
Acetonitrile/50 mM potassium dihydroxy phosphate buffer
(pH 2.5) (50/50, v/v) was used as the mobile phase at a flowrate of 0.7 ml /g215min
–1. The detection limit of phenols was
about 0.5 /g109M.
We attempted to select freshwater microalgae exhibiting
the ability to remove 40 /g109M DNP, which was employed as a
model compound, because DNP exhibits toxicity to micro-
algae by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and photo-synthesis and is often contained in the wastewater from dye
production. At first, the concentration change in DNP in
uninoculated media was tested, and the concentration wasfound not to decrease. Table 1 shows the removal of DNP
during the cultivation period of 72 h. C. fusca  and A. vari-
abilis  removed 57% and 86% of the DNP, respectively,
which are the highest removal levels among the seven greenalgal strains and three cyanobacterial strains investigated
here. Therefore, these strains were used for further studies.
These selected strains grew well in the DNP concentra-
tion range of 5 to 40 /g109M (Figs. 1a and 2a). A. variabilis  had
the ability to remove slightly higher levels of DNP than did
C. fusca . The lower the initial DNP concentration, the
higher the level of removal obtained (Figs. 1b and 2b).These results suggest that both strains grow well photo-
autotrophically and can remove DNP efficiently even in the
low concentration range without the addition of any organiccarbon sources.
The removal of nitrophenols, bisphenol A, and chloro-
phenols, which are contained in some industrial waste-
waters and landfill leachates, was investigated. Light illu-
mination during cultivation is one important factor for treat-
ment of organic pollutants by microalgae, because they trans-
form and degrade the pollutants using energy generated byphotosynthesis (19, 20). Therefore, the effect of light on the
removal of phenols was also determined. Table 2 shows theremoval of these phenols by C. fusca  and A. variabilis  at
120 h under light or dark conditions. The concentration of
nitrophenols and bisphenol A did not decrease in the ab-sence of algal cells. o-Nitrophenol and DNP were removed
efficiently
 by the two strains  both in the light and dark.
m-Nitrophenol was also efficiently removed by A. variabilis
(light, 100%; dark, 84%), whereas C. fusca  removed 60%

ficiently removed only by C. fusca  and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
by A. variabilis . Some physical and chemical characteristics
of these nitrophenols are similar. For example, the octa-
nol/water partition coefficients (log P) of these nitrophe-
nols, which is commonly used as an index of the permeabil-ity of chemicals through cell membranes, are very close in
value as follows; trinitrophenol (2.03), m-nitrophenol (2.00),
p-nitrophenol (1.91), o-nitrophenol (1.79), and DNP (1.67)
(21). However, the removal patterns of nitrophenols by these
strains were not correlated with the log P of the nitro-
phenols. Furthermore, the removal pattern was variable foreach strain and differed in the light and dark. Therefore, re-
moval of nitrophenols was thought not to be the result of
simple uptake into cells by permeation, but to be related tosome specific intracellular reaction, such as an enzymatic
degradation process.
Bisphenol A is a phenolic endocrine disrupter that has
been frequently detected in industrial wastewaters (8) and
the aquatic environment (15). C. fusca  showed the high
ability to remove bisphenol A (85%) at 120 h, whereas A.
variabilis  removed it to a small extent (Table 2).
The removal of chlorophenols was investigated using the
small closed-type photobioreactor to suppress volatilizationof chlorophenols from the medium. Figure 3 shows the
removal of chlorophenols in the presence and absence of
cells. Although volatilization of chlorophenols was not sup-
pressed completely, a significant decrease in o- and p-chloro-
phenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol were observed for both C.
fusca  and A. variabilis . The removal of chlorophenols was
not observed in the dark (data not shown).
C. fusca  and A. variabilis  were found to have high DNP
removal ability under photoautotrophic conditions. Theseselected strains could remove nitrophenols, bisphenol A and
chlorophenols. There have been a few studies on the re-
moval of phenols by microalgae. Klekner and Kosaric re-ported that DNP was removed by Senedesmus obliquus , but
the level of removal of o-chlorophenol and 2,4-dichloro-
phenol was unclear because of their volatilization from the
medium (22). We showed the ability of microalgae to re-
move chlorophenols by improving the photobioreactor usedto suppress volatilization.  Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report to show the removal ofbisphenol A by microalgae. From these results, a microalgal
culture system using these strains would be useful to treat
various hazardous phenols without the addition of any or-ganic carbon sources.
This study was partly supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific
Research (no. 13650856) from the Ministry of Education, Culture,
Sports, Science and Technology in Japan.
