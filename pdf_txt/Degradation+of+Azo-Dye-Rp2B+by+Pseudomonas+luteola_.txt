APseudomonas luteola strain possessing azoreductase activity was utilized to
decolorize a reactive azo dye (C. I. Reactive Red 22) with fed-batch processes consistingof an aerobic cell growth stage and an anaerobic fed-batch decolorization stage. Thefed-batch decolorization was conducted with different agitation and aeration rates,initial culture volumes, dye loading strategies, and yeast extract to dye ( Y/D) ratios,
and the effect of those operation parameters on azo dye decolorization was evaluated.Dissolved oxygen strongly inhibited the azo reduction activity; thus aeration shouldbe avoided during decolorization but slight agitation (around 50 rpm) was needed.With the periodical feeding strategy, the specific decolorization rate ( v
dye) and overall
decolorization efficiency ( Łdye) tended to increase with increasing feeding concentrations
of dye, whereas substrate inhibition seems to arise when the feeding concentrationexceeded 600 mg dye/L. In the continuous feeding mode, higher initial culture volumeresulted in better Ł
dyedue to higher biomass loading, but lower vdyedue to lower dye
concentration in the bioreactor. With a volumetric flow rate ( F) of 25 mL/h, both vdye
and Łdyeincreased almost linearly with the increase in the loading rate of dye ( Fdye)
over the range of 50 -200 mg/h, while further increase in Fdye(400 mg/h) gave rise to
a decline in vdyeand Łdye.A st h e Fwas doubled (50 mL/h), the vdyeand Łdyeincreased
with Fdyeonly for Fdye<80 mg/h. The best vdye(113.7 mg dye g cell-1h-1) and Łdye
(86.3 mg dye L-1h-1) were achieved at Fdye)200 mg/h and F)25 mL/h. The yield
coefficient representing the relation between dye decolorized and yeast extractconsumed was estimated as 0.8 g/g. With F
dye)75 mg/h, the Y/Dratio should be
higher than 0.5 to ensure sufficient supply of yeast extract for stable fed-batchoperations. However, performance of the fed-batch decolorization process was notappreciably improved by raising the Y/Dratio from 0.5 to 1.875 but was more sensitive
to the changes in the dye loading rate.
Introduction
Color removal from industrial effluents has been a
major concern in wastewater treatment, especially for thewastewater that originates from dyestuff and textileplants which continuously discharge a great quantity ofremaining dyes into the environment ( 1-3). The most
commonly used synthetic dyes in Taiwan have been theazo dyes, which usually could not be removed effectivelywith conventional aerobic biological treatment unitsbecause they are recalcitrant to the majority of microbialgenus under aerobic conditions ( 1, 2). As a consequence,
traditional biological processes were often combined withphysical and chemical treatments to achieve a bettercolor removal efficiency ( 3). However, implementation of
physical/chemical methods may be costly and oftengenerates a significant amount of sludge or easily causessecondary pollution due to excessive chemical usage.Other emerging techniques, such as ozonation, Fenton’sreagent ( 3), electrochemical destruction ( 4, 5), and photo-
catalysis ( 6) may have the potential for decolorization,
but they usually involve complicated procedures or areeconomically unfeasible. Apparently, there is still ademand for alternative dye decolorization approaches,such as microbial decolorization processes ( 1), for a more
natural and complete cleanup of the pollutants in a moreeconomical way.
Decolorization of azo dyes by bacterial strains was
typically initiated by azoreductase-catalyzed anaerobicreduction or cleavage of azo bonds ( 7). The resulting
metabolites could further be degraded under aerobic oranaerobic conditions ( 8, 9) by a mixed bacterial com-
munity ( 1, 10, 11 ). Therefore, an aerobic -anaerobic
sequential environment was proposed for bacterial deg-radation or mineralization of azo dyes ( 12). With their
ligninolytic degradation activity, wood-rotting fungi (e.g.,Phanerochaete chrysosporium ) have been found to ef-
fectively degrade a variety of azo dyes under aerobicconditions, primarily with the aid of fungal lignin per-oxidase ( 13). A novel Penicillium isolate (ATCC 74414)
was also found to aerobically decolorize polymeric dyes
(14). Hence, the dye-degrading fungi have frequently
been used in bioreactors for the decolorization anddegradation of azo dyes ( 12, 15 -17), despite the fact that
decolorization by fungi is normally very time-consuming(12). Unlike the fungal decolorization system, bacteria-
based color-removal processes have seldom been studied.Moreover, the existing bioreactor studies for bacterialdecolorization have been performed exclusively withmixed bacterial consortia, such as activated sludge

Published on Web 10/12/2000systems ( 12). The results obtained from the mixed-culture
studies may be more comparable to practical situations,but they could only provide an averaged macroscopic viewof what occurs in the culture and are poorly reproducible,making it very difficult to interpret the data. Therefore,the present work used a pure-culture system to ensurereproducibility of data, easier interpretation of the ex-perimental observations, and more importantly, clearquantitative details of how the kinetics of azo-dye decol-orization responds to changes of operation parametersin bioreactors.
The bacterial strain used in this study was a Pseudomo-
nas luteola strain which was shown to remove the color
of an azo dye from solutions via azoreductase-drivenbiotransformation ( 18, 19 ). A reactive azo dye (C. I.
Reactive Red 22) that is currently used in a dyeingfactory located in central Taiwan was chosen as the dyesubstrate for this study. The feasibility of utilizing thestrain in practical decolorization processes was assessedwith bioreactor studies. Since the oxygen requirementsfor cell growth and decolorization are completely opposite,chemostat operations that require simultaneous cellgrowth and decolorization seem less feasible. Instead, weapplied a fed-batch process which enables batch growthof the cells under aerobic conditions, followed by asubsequent switch to anaerobic conditions for decolori-zation with appropriate feeding strategies of substrates.The dependence of decolorization efficiency on agitation/aeration rates, initial culture volumes, mercury loadingstrategies, and yeast extract supply strategies wasinvestigated for the fed-batch bioprocesses. Experimentalresults obtained from this study were used to evaluatethe feasibility of the microbial process for azo dyedecolorization and to provide valuable information forfurther improvement of the bioprocess.
Experimental Methods
Microorgansim and Cultivation. Pseudomonas lu-
teola was isolated from an activated-sludge system
utilized to treat dyed wastewater from a dyeing factorylocated in central Taiwan ( 18). The strain was found to
express azoreductase activity and was able to decolorizea variety of azo dyes via a pathway initiated by enzymaticfission of azo bonds ( 18). The products resulting from the
bacterial decolorization of azo dye were typically aromaticamines ( 18-20). The P. luteola strain was cultivated
aerobically at 28 °C with a YG medium, typicallycontaining 1.25 g/L of glucose (Difco) and 3 g/L of yeastextract (Difco). Normally, 200 mg/L of azo dye wasincorporated with the YG medium to induce the azo-reduction activity of the P. luteola strain ( 18).
Analytical Methods. The reactive azo dye used in this
study was C. I. Reactive Red 22 (see Figure 1 for itschemical composition), which was obtained from Sumi-tomo, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The concentration of ReactiveRed 22 in samples was determined by measuring theoptical density (OD) of the supernatant of the sample at510 nm with a UV -vis spectrophotometer (JASCO modelV-530). The dissolved oxygen levels in the culture were
measured with an oxygen meter (WTW, model Oxi538).
Decolorization at Different Agitation and Aera-
tion Rates. Pseudomonas luteola cells were cultivated
aerobically with a 5-L fermentor (Eyela Jar FermentorMDF) equipped with devices that measure and controltemperature, dissolved oxygen level (DO), pH, and agita-tion speed. The growth medium was YG medium amendedwith 200 mg/L Reactive Red 22. The cultivation temper-ature and agitation speed were controlled at 28 °C and450 rpm, respectively. The air flow rate was set at 1 vvm(1 vol of air/vol of medium/min). To evaluate the effectsof the agitation and aeration rates on the decolorizationof Reactive Red 22, aerobic growth was terminated atearly-stationary phase (approximately 1.0 -1.5 g cell/L)
and decolorization of the azo dye was performed with arange of agitation (0 -200 rpm) and aeration (0-0.05
L/min) rates. The concentrations of cells, Reactive Red22, and dissolved oxygen were monitored as a functionof time. Each decolorization culture was supplementedwith an appropriate amount of yeast extract to maintainthe metabolic activity of P. luteola for the generation of
the reduced electron carrier (NADH), which acts as acofactor of azoreductase. Typically ,1go f yeast extract
was supplied for the addition of 0.8 g of Reactive Red22.
Fed-Batch Decolorization under Sequential Aero-
bic-Anaerobic Environments. Aerobic Cell Growth
and Pretreatment of the Seed Culture. The seed
culture was prepared by cultivation of P. luteola in a 5-L
jar fermenter at 28 °C with YG medium containing 200mg/L Reactive Red 22. In general, the working volumeof the seed culture was 2 L. The agitation and air aerationrates for the aerobic growth were 450 rpm and 1 vvm,respectively. As the seed culture reached the desirablecell density (approximately 1.0 g cell/L), the aeration andagitation rates were switched to those suitable fordecolorization (aeration rate )0, agitation rate )50
rpm). Prior to being used for fed-batch operations, anappropriate amount of dye (typically 200 mg/L) wasadded into the seed culture to carry out decolorization ofReactive Red 22 in batch mode until the color in thereactor was completely removed. The main purpose ofthe pretreatment procedures was to stimulate the activityof azoreductase, which is reportedly inducible by the azodyes ( 19). In addition, the nutrients in YG medium that
were not completely consumed during aerobic cell growthcould be utilized further during the adaptation proce-dures so that the subsequent fed-batch experimentswould be started with a clear background without pos-sible interference by the remaining nutrients from thegrowth medium.
Fed-Batch Operations with a Periodical Dye Load-
ing. Previous studies ( 20) show that dissolved oxygen in
the culture inhibits the decolorization of Reactive Red22 in shake flasks. The fed-batch culture was thusoperated without the supply of air, while a gentleagitation (50 rpm) was sustained to improve the masstransfer efficiency. Due to the above conditions, thetypical DO level in the culture was around 0.1 mg/L. Afixed amount of filter-sterilized Reactive Red 22 (rangingfrom 200 to 600 mg/L) was added into the reactorcontaining the aforementioned 2-L seed culture at des-ignated time intervals, until the total dye loading was1.2 g. During the course of the operation, the yeastextract was supplied with a yeast extract to dye weightratio ( Y/D) of 1.25. The concentrations of cells and the
azo dye in the reactor were measured as a function oftime.

Loading. The procedures were similar to those used for
the periodical-loading experiments, except that the dyeand yeast extract were continuously added into thereactor (initial culture volume )2.0 L) at a constant rate
of 25 or 50 mL/h, until a terminal volume o f4Lw a s
reached. In the experiments with a fixed Y/Dratio of 1.25,
the azo-dye loading rates ranging from 25 to 400 mg/hwere examined. In the experiments with different Y/D
ratios, the loading rate of dye was kept constant at 75mg/h, while the loading rate of yeast extract was adjustedto achieve a Y/Dratio of 0, 0.5, 1.25, and 1.875. In the
experiments with various initial culture volumes, the fed-batch operation was started with an initial culturevolume of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 L with a constant dye feedingrate of 75 mg/h and a Y/Dratio of 1.25. For all experi-
ments, concentrations of cells and the residual dye weremonitored as a function of time.
Results and Discussion
Effects of Agitation and Aeration Rates on De-
colorization of Reactive Red 22. It is known that
azoreductase-driven bacterial decolorization of azo dyesis normally inhibited by the presence of oxygen primarilydue to the competition in the oxidation of reducedelectron carriers (e.g., NADH) with either oxygen or azogroups as the electron receptor ( 1). Consequently, in the
bioreactor design, the aeration and agitation that provideoxygen for cell growth and stimulate the contact of thecells with medium substrates should be properly regu-lated to attain an optimal efficiency of decolorization. For
this reason, the influence of agitation and aeration rateson the performance of the bioreactor was examined inbatch mode. As no aeration was employed, the dissolvedoxygen level in the culture was negligible for an agitationrate ranging from 0 to 100 rpm. Under these conditions,decolorization of the dye did occur, as indicated by thedecrease in residual dye (regions A -C in Figure 2). The
DO level rose slightly during the operation period of 40 -50 h (agitation rate )100 rpm), leading to a slower
decolorization rate (region C in Figure 2). Furtherincreasing of agitation rate to 200 rpm (region D inFigure 2) resulted in a visible increase in dissolvedoxygen level from 0.2 to 1.5 mg/L; decolorization ofReactive Red 22 stopped correspondingly. As the aerationwas provided at a rate of 0.05 L/min, the DO levelincreased abruptly from 1.5 to approximately 4.0 mg/L,and no decolorization of the azo dye was observed. Theresults in Figure 2 indicate that the bacterial decolori-zation was very sensitive to DO; thus for an efficient colorremoval, the agitation rate should be below 100 rpm, andaeration should be avoided.
Fed-Batch Operations with a Periodical Feeding
of Reactive Red 22. In this study, the performance of
decolorization of Reactive Red 22 with P. luteola was
assessed with two parameters: specific decolorizationrate ( v
dye) and overall decolorization efficiency ( Łdye). The
vdyevalue is determined by dividing the fastest slope of
the time profiles of residual dye by the total dry cellweight in the reactor; thus v
dyerepresents the ultimately
achievable decolorization capability of P. luteola in the
bioreactor on the cell-mass basis. On the other hand, Łdye
is an indication of the capacity of the bioreactor for
decolorization of the azo dye, as it is defined as totalamount of the dye decolorized per total volume treatedper total operation time.
Decolorization results with pulse feeding of 210, 300,
and 600 mg/L of Reactive Red 22 at designated timeintervals are compared in Table 1. The identical amountof total dye loading (around 1.2 g) fed with 300 mg/Levery 4 h exhibited a better specific decolorization rate
(107.8 mg dye g cell
-1h-1) and overall decolorization
efficiency (75 mg dye L-1h-1) than those obtained from
the other two pulse feeding strategies. Pulse feeding with210 and 600 mg/L resulted in similar v
dyevalues (49.4
and 45.8 mg dye g cell-1h-1, respectively) and Łdyevalues
(40 and 37.5 mg dye L-1h-1, respectively). Table 1
indicates the impact of the dye concentration on thedecolorization performance of the bioreactor. Higher dyeconcentration in the culture seems to be the cause forthe higher v
dyethat resulted from a pulse feeding of 300
mg/L, in contrast to that obtained from a feeding of 210mg/L. However, increasing the concentration of pulsefeeding to 600 mg/L did not result in better v
dye, suggest-
ing that a substrate-inhibition effect may arise from anexcess loading of the dye. This is consistent with ourprevious observation with shake-flask decolorizationexperiments in which the rate of decolorization wasoptimal at an initial Reactive Red 22 concentration ofapproximately 400 mg/L, above which the rate declinedconsiderably (data not shown).
Due to low DO levels (no aeration, low agitation rates)
and limited carbon and nitrogen sources (only yeastextract was provided), there was essentially no cellgrowth during the course of fed-batch operation; thustotal cell mass in the bioreactor was virtually unchangedthroughout the experiments (data not shown). It is alsonoted from Figure 2 (regions A -C) that the residual dye
profile resulting from periodical feeding decreased at asimilar rate; thus the v
dyeremained nearly constant
during the majority of the operation period. As the cellconcentration and specific decolorization rate remainednearly constant, higher v
dyegave rise to better Łdyevalues,
which is exactly what we observe from Table 1.

to respiration substrates under anaerobic conditions,since decolorization of C. I. Reactive Red 141 as a solecarbon source gave a decolorization rate lower than therate measured in the presence of a supplemental labilecarbon source (such as glucose). They attributed thisfinding to the fact that catabolism of the respirationsubstrates is responsible for the production of reducingpower required for azo reduction. Our recent work ( 19)
showed that addition of yeast extract significantly en-hanced the anaerobic decolorization of Reactive Red 22,whereas glucose, an efficient carbon source for the aerobicgrowth of P. luteola , strongly inhibited the microbial
decolorization. The inhibitory effect of glucose most likelyresulted from the catabolism repression provoked byintracellular glucose content ( 21). However, the glucose
repression effect found in P. luteola is not universal, since
Haug et al. ( 10) reported that addition of glucose into a
bacterial consortium enhanced the decolorization of agroup of sulfonated azo dyes. Due to its inhibitory effects,glucose was not supplemented to the decolorizationculture. Alternatively, yeast extract was used as the solesupplemental respiration substrate to maintain the de-colorization activity.
In an attempt to obtain quantitative correlation be-
tween consumption of yeast extract versus decolorizationof Reactive Red 22, the dye was loaded at a constant rateof 75 mg/h into a 2-L culture (cell concentration was 0.9g/L) containing approximately 900 mg/L of yeast extractinitially. No external feeding of yeast extract was pro-vided. The resulting residual dye profiles are shown inFigure 3. For the first 15 h, the residual dye concentra-tion increased at a rate much slower than that of thecumulative dye loading, which signals that decolorizationof the dye occurred. The residual dye rose sharply after15 h of operation, and the rate of its increase becamesimilar to the rate of dye loading (Figure 3a), resultingin the termination of decolorization as the cumulativeamount of dye decolorization leveled off after 15 h (Figure
3b). The retardation of decolorization of Reactive Red 22above 15 h may be ascribed to the depletion of the keycomponents in yeast extract that are essential to thedecolorization activity of the P. luteola strain after
continuous feeding of the dye at 75 mg/h for 15 h.Accordingly, we may obtain a yield coefficient relatingyeast extract and dye by calculating the ratio of theamount of azo dye decolorized within the first 15 h andthe amount of yeast extract present. The yield coefficientwas estimated to be approximately 0.8 g dye/g yeastextract. The information obtained here provides a clearquantitative assessment of how the consumption of a
respiration substrate is related to color removal of theazo dye.
Effect of Initial Culture Volume .Since essentially
no cell growth occurs under decolorization conditions dueto the low DO level, an increase in initial culture volume(V
o) indicates elevation of biomass loading for the decol-
orization process. Three initial culture volumes (1.5, 2.0,and 2.5 L) were examined for their performance ondecolorization of Reactive Red 22 with a dye loading rateof 75 mg/L. The results are presented in Table 2, whichshows that the specific decolorization rate ( v
dye) decreased
with an increase in Vo, while an opposite trend was
observed for the overall decolorization efficiency ( Łdye).
It can be expected that Łdyevalue increased with increas-
ingVosince more biocatalyst ( P. luteola cells) is presentTable 1. Fed-Batch Decolorization of Reactive Red 22 by Pseudomonas luteola with Periodical Feeding Strategiesa

volumes also dilute the added dye to give a lowerconcentration, which is unfavorable for decolorizationaccording to reaction kinetics, and thus results in lowerv
dyevalues.
Effect of Dye Loading Rate (F dye) and Volumetric
Flow Rate (F) .Table 3 summarizes the operation
conditions and the color removal performance of fed-batchbioreactors with dye loading rates ( F
dye) in the range of
25-400 mg/h and with volumetric flow rates ( F)o f2 5
and 50 mL/h. The dependence of the specific decoloriza-tion rate ( v
dye) and overall decolorization efficiency ( Łdye)
onFdyeand Fis illustrated in Figure 4. Inspection of
Table 3 and Figure 4 shows that for F)25 mL/h, the
vdyeand Łdyevalues increased almost proportionally to the
increase in dye loading rates, except for Fdyehigher than
200 mg/h. Increasing Fdyeto 400 mg/h caused a consider-
able drop in both vdyeand Łdyevalues, which may be
attributed to the substrate inhibition, as the final re-sidual dye concentration rose to nearly 5900 mg/L (Table3). In contrast, if the volumetric flow rate was doubled,the v
dyeand Łdyevalues increased linearly with dye
loading rates only for Fdyelower than 80 mg/h, above
which the increase in vdyeand Łdyevalues was limiting.
Moreover, with the same dye loading rate, the twovolumetric rates resulted in similar v
dyeand Łdyevalues
at low dye loading rates, whereas much better vdyeand
Łdyevalues resulted from a lower F(25 mL/h) when Fdye
was larger than 80 mg/h (Figure 4).
Assessment of the effect of dye loading rate and
volumetric flow rate on the performance of decolorization,as illustrated in Figure 4, shows that the key factor wasthe residual dye concentrations. For the same F
dye,
feeding with a higher volumetric flow rate led to a fasterdilution of the dye concentration in the culture, resultingin a lower residual dye concentration, and, consequently,a lower decolorization rate. Likewise, when an identicalvolumetric flow rate was used, higher F
dyeincreased the
dye concentration in the culture and thus led to theenhancement on the decolorization rate and efficiency.Nevertheless, increasing F
dyedid not ensure higher vdye
and Łdye, since Table 3 shows that elevation of Fdyeto 400
mg/h led to overloading of the dye, resulting in decreasesinv
dyeand Łdyedue to substrate inhibition. Besides, the
final dye concentration ( Cdye,f) in the culture (i.e., the dye
concentration at the end of feeding) tended to increasewith increasing dye loading rates (Table 3). For instance,C
dye,fincreased more than 100-fold if Fdyewas raised from
50 to 400 mg/h. Since the remaining dye concentration(C
dye,f) needed to be decolorized further with batch-mode
operation to meet the government’s requirements for thedischarge of the treated water, a longer follow-up treat-ment would be required for fed-batch processes operatedat higher dye loading rates.Effect of Yeast Extract to Dye (Y/D) Ratios .Recent
studies ( 18-20) have shown that P. luteola was able to
decolorize azo dyes, such as Red G, RP
2B, and Reactive
Red 22, under media containing exclusively yeast extract,and in the absence of any carbon and nitrogen sources.The metabolism of yeast extract is considered essentialto the regeneration of NADH ( 2). It has also been found
from shake-flask experiments that increasing yeastextract concentrations led to higher specific decolorizationrates ( 20). Thus, the optimal strategy for the supply of
yeast extract should be important in the bioreactordesign. As mentioned earlier, a yield coefficient thatcorrelates decolorization of Reactive Red 22 to theconsumption of yeast extract was estimated as 0.8 g/g,equivalent to a Y/Dratio of 1.25. Therefore, we regulated
theY/Dratios in the feeding stream to reveal how yeast
extract content affected the decolorization rates in fed-batch operations.
The residual dye profiles resulting from fed-batch
bioreactors operated at different Y/Dratios are shown
in Figure 5, and the kinetic characteristics of each fed-batch decolorization run is compared in Table 4. WithY/D)0, decolorization occurred for the first 18 h, after
which the residual dye concentration rose sharply, and10 hours later, the residual dye and cumulative dyeloading profiles increased at the same rate, indicatingthat the decolorization had stopped (Figure 5a), primarilydue to the lack of yeast extract available to enable theazoreductase activity. Although yeast extract was ex-Table 3. Fed-Batch Decolorization of Reactive Red 22 by Pseudomonas luteola with Continuous Feeding Strategies:

had decolorization activity for a short period of time,which was most likely contributable by the residualnutrients in the seed culture as well as the remainingintracellular metabolic energy and cofactors. However,since the decolorization failed within 20 h because of theshortage of yeast extract supply, the v
dyeand Łdyevalues
were much lower than those obtained from higher Y/D
ratios (Table 4). As the Y/Dratio was increased to 0.5,
the sharp rise in residual dye similar to that observedforY/D)0 still existed, but it took place after 50 h of
feeding (Figure 5a), suggesting that the supply of yeastextract at Y/D)0.5 could only maintain a stable
decolorization operation for 50 h. No sharp increase inresidual dye was observed for nearly 80 h as Y/Dwas
increased to 1.25 and 1.875, indicating that adequatesupply of yeast extract was critical to the stability of the
fed-batch decolorization operations. However, as the Y/D
ratio exceeded 0.5, further increase in Y/Ddid not
enhance the rate ( v
dye) and overall efficiency ( Łdye)o f
decolorization significantly (Table 4). This seems to implythat the concentration of yeast extract was not the rate-limiting factor during the fed-batch operations adaptedin this study. Instead, the dye loading rate was the keyfactor that controlled the decolorization rate and theoverall efficiency of the bioprocess, as evidenced by thedata indicated in Table 3 and Figure 4.Conclusions
Fed-batch bioprocesses using Pseudomonas luteola
were shown to effectively decolorize Reactive Red 22. Dueto the inhibitory effect of oxygen on the bacterial decol-orization, the bioreactor should be operated with gentleagitation and without aeration, but these conditionsappeared to limit the cell growth during the course ofdecolorization. The performance of the fed-batch biore-actor was closely affected by the initial biomass loading,the feeding strategy, the yeast extract-to-dye ratio ( Y/
D), but most importantly, the dye loading rate. The best
specific decolorization rate and overall decolorizationefficiency obtained in this study were 113.7 mg dye gcell
-1h-1and 86.3 mg dye L-1h-1, respectively, and both
occurred when the dye was fed continuously into aninitial culture volume o f 2 L with a constant dye loading
rate of 200 mg/h and a Y/Dratio of 1.25. To avoid an
insufficient yeast extract supply that would depress thedecolorization efficiency, the Y/Dratio should be main-
tained higher than 0.5. The decolorization efficiency canbe enhanced significantly by increasing the dye loadingrates but was insensitive to the elevation of Y/Dratios.
However, dye loading rate should not be increasedwithout limits since substrate inhibition may occur withoverloading of the dye. Besides, higher loading rateswould result in higher residual dye concentration at theend of feeding, and consequently, a longer follow-up batchdecolorization treatment for complete color removal of thetreated water.
