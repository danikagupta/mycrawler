Abstract : In t his study, degradation of methylene blue (MB) from water was investigated by 
photocatalysis process in presence of TiO 2 under solar radiation. Some of process parameters such as 
catalyst loading, initial concentra tion and pH were examined for influencing on efficiency 
degradation process. The results showed that pH of solution is acidic to enhance the photocatalytic 
efficiency was found. However, loading of TiO 2 was found to be 2 g/l as optimal, which the 
availability of surface to adsorb more molecules of MB was achieved  with this loading. Therefore, 
lower concentration also lead  to achieve highest degradation efficiency of MB.

INTRODUCTION  
 
 About the 1 -20 % of dyes production in the world has  been discharged to environment from different 
industries as example textile finishi ng and dyestuff manufacturing (Mahvi, 2009; El -Sharkawy, 2007) . Some of 
risks from dye in water have been  considered for huma n such as nausea, eyes  effects and  vomiting (El-
Sharkawy, 2007; Lang, 2009) .  
 Methlyene blue (MB) is one of pollutant color for environment undesirable which effect s on aesthetic of 
environment (Saquib, 2008; Jain, 2088) . As international environmental standards are becoming more stringent 
(ISO 14001, October 1996), technological systems for the removal of organic pollutants, such as dyes have been recently developed.  
 Many chemical and physical methods are used for treat,  such as chlorination, ozonation (Slokar , 1998) and 
adsorption, biological  (Houas, 1999) . Recently,  new method  of oxidation  “advanced  oxidation processes” 
(AOP) has been used as emerging destructive method which going to complete mineralization of pollutan t 
(Herrmann,1999; Schiavello, 1988; Herrmann, 1993; Bahnemann, 1994; Legrini, 1993) . Photocatalytic 
degradation of methylene blue (MB) from waste water has been studied using Titanium dioxide (TiO
2) thin 
films ( Gao, 2000) , and T iO2 powder in aqueous solution ( Sopajaree, 1999) . TiO 2 has been  reported as a good 
semiconductor  for removal many organic  compounds, may due to high oxidation efficiency, complete 
decomposition process,  cheap and nontoxic material ( Qamar, 2009; Ba-Abbad, 2012 a; Ba-Abbad, 2012 b;  
Takriff, 2011) .  
 In this work, TiO 2 was used as photocatalyst under direct solar radiation . Effects of some factors such as 
loading of TiO 2 and concentration of MB on photocatalytic efficiency were investigated in this study.   
 
Experimental : 
Materials :  
 Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) photocatalyst and methylene blue (MB) were supplied from sigma Aldrich . 
Deionized water was used for preparing all standard solutions .    
 Photocatalytic Reactor and Experimental Procedures : 
 All experiments were carried out using 100 ml in cylinder glass reactor. Different amount (1 to 3 g/l) of 
TiO2 was added to certain concentration of MB to determine the optimal loading of photocatalytic  process. 
Methlyene blue  (MB) solution with TiO
2 was stirred for 60 min under the dark condition for adsorption –
desorption equilibrium and then exposed to solar light.  
 A 3 ml from solution was withdrawn every 15min irradiate  time and separate the TiO2 particles by 
centrifuge. The concentration of clear sol ution was determined by Perkin Elmer (Lambda 35) UV/VIS 
spectrophotometer (UV –VIS) equipped under range of absorbance between 200to 800 nm. The wavelength of 
absorption and standard calibration for Methlyene blue  (MB) was 665 nm with R2 correlation fit of 0.996.  
The photocatalytic  degradation was calculated based on Eq. (1).

  Where Co (mg/L) is the concentration of MB  at t=0 min, C t (mg/l ) is the concentration at various intervals of 
the radiation period.   
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Photodegradability : 
 Fig.1 shows the effects of presence of the TiO 2 and solar radiation on photocatalytic degradation of MB. 
The absorbance spectra of MB at wavelength of 660 nm with interval time was decreased when the TiO 2 and 
solar radiation presence together.   
 
 
Fig. 1: Effects of TiO 2 and solar on MB degradation efficiency, (b) absorbance of  MB with concentration of 25 
mg/l, 2 g/l loading of TiO 2 and 120 min .   
  In the presence of TiO
2 with MB under the dark condition, about 5 % was adsorbed which  even after 120 
min. The result was negligible when solar was used alone which appeared lower value of degradation. However, 
in the presence of TiO 2 and solar light, the MB was totally degraded  (90 %) within  more than 120 minutes. 
These results confirmed that presence of the solar light was more affected factor especially sunny d ay as 
reported previous work ( Ba-Abbad, 2012 c; Ba -Abbad, 2012 d) .   
 
Effect of pH S olution : 
 pH solution shows as one of important factor effecting on efficiency of photocatalytic process whi ch has 
been reported earlier (Hoffmann, 1995; Lewis,  1993)  .To evaluate the optimum value of pH solution, the 
experiments was carried out with pH value  from 4 to 8.   Fig.2 shows the results of MB degradation, which higher at acidic solution (pH at 4.0) after 2 hr using 25 
mg/l as initial concentration. To explain effects of pH so lution, the zero point charge ( pH zc) of TiO
2 is between 
5.8-6.8 (Madhu,  2006) , which the adsorption of MB molecules onto the surface of TiO2 catalyst as important 
step to start photooxidation reaction.   According to zero point charge (pH zc) of TiO
2, the sur face is positively below pH zc and negativily charge 
of MB molecules. For this reason, the strong adsorption of MB onto TiO 2 surface at pH solution of 4.0 and 
highest degrada tion was found.

 Effect Loading TiO 2 Catalyst:  
 Fig. 3  shows effect of different loading of TiO 2 on the MB degradation process. Range between 1 to 3 g/l , 
25 mg/l and  pH at 4.0 were used to investigate the optimum loading of the catalyst.  The photodegradation 
efficiency increasing with loading was increased from 1 to 2 g/l which completely disappea red MB  under 90 
min irradiation time.  
 At same time, decreases of efficiency was observed when the using higher loading of 3 g/l. The main 
reasons were the increase the turbidity of the suspension TiO 2 catalyst and low light penetration and decreased 
surfa ce area by agglomeration of catalyst reported earlier studies  (Behnajady, 2006; Lathasree, 2004) .

Effect of MB Concentrations : 
 Different initial concentrations of MB with rang from 12.5 to 50 mg/l were used to evaluate the catalyst 
activity as shown in Fig.3. The photodegradation efficiency decreases was observed with concentration more 
than 25 m/l after 90 min irradiation time. T his fact explain as, the adsorption capacity is higher at lower 
concentration because more active site is available for MB molecules to be adsorbed on the TiO2 catalyst 
surface.  
 At higher concentration which the more and more molecules of MB adsorbed onT iO2 surface would hinder 
the hydroxyl radicals generation via adsorption of OH‾ ions ( H+ + OH− → •OH) causes the decrease rate of 
photodegradation reaction ( Augugliaro, 1988;  Ba-Abbad, 2013a; Ba -Abbad, 2013b. Therefore, much longer 
time is required (> 120 minutes) to reach the complete degradation of higher concentrations of MB compared to 
less than 25 mg/L  (Ba-Abbad, 2013c) .

Conclusion:  
 The photocatalytic degradation of MB was examined using TiO 2 catalyst under direct solar light. Some 
parameters such as pH of solution, loading of catalyst and concentration were studied for influencing on 
efficiency of photocatalysis process. A 2 g/ l, pH of solution and 25 mg/l concentration were found as optimal 
conditions of experiment.  
 The heterogeneous photocatalysis was proved to be as attractive method to remove of pollutants from 
industrial wastewaters which convert to nontoxic compounds.
