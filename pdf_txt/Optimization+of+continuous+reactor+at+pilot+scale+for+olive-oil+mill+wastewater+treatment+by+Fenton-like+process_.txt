Abstract:  A secondary treatment for olive mill wa stewater coming from factories working 
with the two-phase olive oil production process (OMW-2) has been set-up on an industrial 
scale in an olive oil mill in the premises of Jaén (Spain). The secondary treatment 
comprises Fenton-like oxidation followed by flocculation-sedimentation and filtration 
through olive stones. In this wo rk, performance modelization a nd preliminary cost analysis 
of a final reverse osmosis (RO) process was examined on pilot scale for ulterior 
purification of OMW-2 with the goal of clos ing the loop of the industrial production 
process. Reduction of concentration polariza tion on the RO membrane equal to 26.3% was 
provided upon increment of the turbulence over the membrane  to values of Reynolds 
number equal to 2.6 × 104. Medium operating pressure ( 25 bar) should be chosen to 
achieve significant steady state permeate flux (21.1 L h−1 m−2) and minimize membrane 
fouling, ensuring less than 14.7% flux drop a nd up to 90% feed recovery. Under these 
conditions, irreversible  fouling below 0.08 L h−2 m−2 bar−1 helped increase the longevity of 
the membrane and reduce the costs of the treatment. For 10 m3 day−1 OMW-2 on average, 
47.4 m2 required membrane area and 0.87 € m−3 total costs for the RO process  
were estimated.

 1. Introduction 
Two principal wastewater streams are nowadays by- produced in olive mills working with the  
two-phase system during the production process of olive oil: olives washing wastewater (OWW), 
which is produced during the olive-fruit washing pr ocedure in the washing machines, and olive oil 
washing wastewater (OOW), which is derived in th e olive oil extraction pro cess during the washing of 
the olive oil in the vertical centrifuges (Figure 1) . The treatment of the li quid effluents generated 
during olive oil production in olive mills, together ca lled olive mill wastewater (OMW-2), is currently 
still a hard task, due to multiple factors [1,2]. 
Figure 1.  Olives washing wastewater (OWW) ( a) and olive oil washing wastewater 
(OOW) ( b) storage and evaporation lagoons. 
 
(a) ( b) 
At the present, an average-sized  olive oil factory working in continuous mode leads to a daily 
amount of up to 10–15 m3 of OOW, in sum to 1 m3 day−1 of OWW. In order to get an idea of the 
dimensions of this, in Spain alone, this gene rates a total volume of more than 9 million m3 of OMW-2 
per year. Furthermore, the pollutants load of these effluents is extremely va riable, not only owing to 
the extraction process, but also to edaphoclimatic a nd cultivation parameters, the type of the olives, 
their quality and maturity, and other factors [1,3].  These factors, in a ddition to small size and 
widespread geographical dispersion of olive oil factories, establish important difficulties for the 
management of these hazard effluents. 
These wastewaters are highly phytot oxic and hazardous for water bodies , soil and aquifers due to 
the presence of aromatic compounds and a wide range  of other organic pollutants, such as phenols, 
tannins and long-chain fatty acids, which are not suitable to be biologically managed. Due to the 
resistance of OMW-2 to microbial degradation [3], biological treatme nt of OMW-2 is not applied on 
an industrial scale as it is not e fficient. Within this context, adva nced operation processes (AOPs) are 
required for the depuration of thes e bio-refractory wastewaters [4–16]. 
Moreover, these effluents also exhibit high saline toxicity, and t hus very significant 
electroconductivity (EC) va lues owing to the presence of a high concentration of inorganic compounds 
among which chloride, sulfate and phosphoric salts of potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium, 
copper and traces of other elements are common charact eristics [1]. This fact also makes it necessary 
to resort to advanced separati on technologies in order to attemp t complete depuration of OMW-2, 
since it is not viable to abate the high concentration of dissolved monovalent and diva lent ions by 
Membranes 2013 , 3 287 
 
 conventional physicochemical treatments. In this re gard, as regulations become more stringent, 
membranes technology offers many advantages comp ared with other separation processes [17,18]. 
A secondary treatment for olive m ill wastewater coming from factor ies working with the two-phase 
olive oil production process (OMW-2) has been recently  set-up and transferred to  an industrial scale in 
an olive oil mill in the premises of Baeza (Jaén, Spain) by the Chemical and Biochemical Processes 
Technology  Research Group of the University of Granad a (Granada, Spain) (Fi gure 2). The secondary 
treatment comprises Fenton-like oxidation, floccu lation and filtration through olive stones. Fenton’s 
process appears to be th e most economically advantageous AOP since it may be conducted at ambient 
temperature and pressure conditions, and also due  its equipment simplicity  and operational ease. 
Furthermore, the use of olive stone s boosts the cost-effectiv eness of the secondary treatment process as 
it is an abundant and renewable agricu ltural residue available at zero cost. 
Figure 2.  The secondary treatment plant set-up in an  olive oil mill located in Jaén (Spain). 
 
In this research work, ulterior purification of OMW-2 was intended with th e goal of closing the 
loop of the industrial production process, pursuing the quality standards for reuse of the purified 
effluent in the proper olive washing machines. With  this intention, modelization of the performance 
and preliminary cost analysis of a final reverse osmosis (RO) process was studied on a pilot scale. 
2. Experimental Section 
2.1. Analytical Methods 
Analytical grade reagents and 99% purity chemi cals were used for the analytical procedures, 
applied at least in triplicate. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (Tss), total 
phenols (TPh), total iron, electroc onductivity (EC) and pH measuremen ts were carried out in the raw 
OMW-2 stream and in the treated effluent at th e end of each depuration step following standard 
methods [19]. 
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined by the photometric determination of the 
concentration of chromium (III) after 2 h of oxidati on with potassium dichromate/sulfuric acid/silver 
sulfate at 148 ± 0.5 °C (German standard methods DIN 38 409-H41-1  and DIN ISO 15 705-H45) [19]. 
At the time of the determinati on of COD, manganese oxide was used to remove residual hydrogen 
peroxide which remained unreacted in  samples taken from the reactor. 
To determine the total suspended solids concentration (Tss), wastewater samples were filtered 
through 1.6 μm standard GF/F glass fiber filters. The residue  retained on the filter was dried in an oven 
Membranes 2013 , 3 288 
 
 at 105 ± 0.5 °C until constant weig ht was observed. The increase in wei ght of the filter represents the 
Tss. Ashes correspond to the minera l salts remaining after the waste sample was calcined further at 
600 ± 0.5 °C for 3 h [19]. 
Total phenols and phenol derivatives were analyzed  by reaction with a derivative thiazol, giving a 
purple azo dye which was determined photometrical ly at 475 nm (Standard German methods ISO 
8466-1 and DIN 38402 A51) [19]. 
EC and pH measurements were performed with  a Crison GLP31 conductivity-meter and a Crison 
GLP21 pH-meter, with autocorrec tion of temperature. A Helios Ga mma UV-visible sp ectrophotometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) served for COD, TPh a nd total iron measurements. Effluent samples were 
diluted when necessary with MilliQ® water for their analysis, whereas samples of RO permeate were 
analyzed directly without dilution. 
Ionic concentrations were analy zed in the raw OMW-2, in the effluent exiting the secondary 
treatment (OMWST-2) as well as in the permeate stream of the fi nal RO membrane stage with a 
Dionex DX-120 ion chromatograph as de scribed in previous works [20,21]. 
Total iron concentration was measured by reducing a ll iron ions to iron ions (II) in a thioglycolate 
medium with a derivative of triazine, forming a reddish-purple complex photometrically determined at 
565 nm (Standard German methods ISO 8466-1 and German DIN 38402 A51) [19]. 
2.2. The OMW-2 Stream 
Samples of both OWW and OOW were collected dur ing winter months fr om various olive oil 
factories working with the modern  two-phase olive oil extraction pr ocess in the Andalusian province 
of Jaén (Spain). The physicochemical charact erization of the raw OWW and OOW samples are 
reported in Table 1.

Total solids, % 0.27 0.6

Firstly, OWW and OOW samples were rapidly anal yzed in the laboratory. Afterwards, both 
effluents were mixed in 1:1 ( v/v) proportion in order to stabilize the mean value of the organic 
concentration and avoid sensible fluctuations in the COD parameter of the stream entering the 
treatment system (OMW-2) (Table 2). OMW-2 st ream was conducted to th e secondary treatment 
already set-up on an in dustrial scale by the Chemical and Biochemical Processes Technology  Research 
Group of the University of Granada (Granada, Spain). The secondary treatment consists basically in an 
AOP based on Fenton’s reagent. In  the industrial plant, the us e of the cheaper ferric (FeCl 3) catalyst Membranes 2013 , 3 289 
 
 (Fenton-like oxidation) instead of ferrous ones highly improves the cost-effectiveness of the  
process [5,6]. Following the oxida tion reactor, floccula tion-sedimentation and filtration in series 
ensure recovery of the catalyst [22,23]: the iron-rich sludge sedimented in the decanter is recirculated 
to the OWW tank (Figure 3) to reduce the catalyst  consumption [22], whereas olive stones permit 
eliminating the residual iron which is known to be especially harmful for polymeric membranes [24]. 
In this regard, olive stones represent an abundant a nd renewable agricultural re sidue available at zero 
cost. A scheme of the industrial-scale seconda ry treatment is given in Figure 3, and the 
physicochemical composition of the raw OMW-2 str eam and the effluent exiting the secondary 
treatment (OMWST-2) is reported in Table 2.

 2.3. Membranes Pilot Plant 
The research study on the final RO membrane ope ration was conducted in a pilot plant provided 
with a 100 L feed tank (FT), where the pretreated feedstock was loaded through a feed line, and a 
pumping system consisting of a centrifugal booster pump (P 1) and a volumetric piston pump (P 2) that 
served to drive the OMWST-2 stream to the sp iral-wound (SW) membrane module fitted in housing 
M1 (Figure 4).

Tangential-flow RO experiments were performed in  semicontinuous operation mode (diafiltration): 
the permeate stream was collected whereas the concentrate stream wa s recycled back the feed tank 
while entering new fresh OMWST-2 feedstock to the membrane system. 
The selected RO membrane was a commerci al spiral-wounded thin-film composite (TFC) 
membrane provided by GE Water and Process Technol ogies (Minnetonka, MN, USA), consisting of a 
polyamide active layer on a polysulfone ultraf iltration support, with an active area of 2.5 m2. Nominal

 The desired operating pressure over the membrane a nd the feed flow rate to the module could be 
adjusted by acting on the regulation valves V 1 and V 2, which are shown in Figure 4, with an accuracy 
of 0.5 bar and 10 L h−1 respectively. The V 1 valve was used for by-pass whereas the V 2 valve served 
for regulating the flow rate of th e concentrate stream, which was re circulated to th e feedwater tank. 
Operating pressure and feed flow  rate were respectively measur ed by analogue manometers and a 
turbine flow meter, whereas permeate flux was ca lculated during operation time by we ighing the mass 
of collected permeate on a precisi on electronic mass balance (AX-120 Cobos, 0.1 mg accuracy). In all 
experiments, operating temperature was controlled at a fixed value equal to am bient temperature (22 °C) 
by means of a plate heat exchanger (E) (see Figure 4), regulated automatically (T set point  ± 0.1 °C) via a 
proportional–integral–derivative (P ID) electronic temperature cont roller (Yokogawa model UT100) 
and a magnetic valve in the temperature-controlling loop. 
3. Results and Discussion 
The objective of this work was to close the loop of  the industrial production process of an olive mill 
working with the two-phase extraction procedure in Baeza (Jaén, Spain). With this intention, 
optimization of a final RO operation to achieve the quality standards for reus e of the purified OMW-2 
effluent in the proper olive washing machines was examined. Performance of the RO membrane 
module was modelized, including permeate flux and me mbrane rejection as function of the main 
operating variables, i.e., operating pressure and tangential velo city. Finally, membrane fouling and 
life-time service as well as simplified economical  analysis of the RO process was studied. 
Firstly, the effect of the net driv ing pressure of the system on the permeate flux of the selected RO 
membrane was studied by fitting the experiment al data to the solution-diffusion model: 
ܬ௣=ܭ∙( Δ ܲ−Δ )ߨ ( 1)
where Jp is the permea te flux (L h−1 m−2), K represents the permeabilit y of the membrane (L h−1 m−2 bar−1) 
and ΔP − Δߨ( bar) is the net pressure ( PTM), that is the difference be tween the applie d pressure ( ΔP) 
and the osmotic pressure ( Δߨ )of the influent entering the RO membrane module. 
The data regarding the dependence of the membrane permeability on the net driving pressure  
and tangential velocity are re ported in Table 4 in the form of pure water permeability ( Kw) and 
permeability with the OMWST-2 effluent ( K), obtained for ambient opera ting temperature (22 °C). The 
osmotic pressure of OMWST-2, equal to 1.5 bar at 22 °C, was calculated by means of Van’t Hoff 
equation ߨf = Σci,f·RT, where ci,f is the feed molar concentration of ion i (mol L−1), R is the ideal gas 
constant (8.314 J K−1 mol−1) and T is the absolute temperature (K).

 Results withdrawn s how a value of the pure water permeability coefficient ( Kw) of 1.41 L h−1 m−2 bar−1, 
whereas K measured with the secondary-treated ef fluent (OMWST-2) was equal to 0.86 L h−1 m−2 bar−1 
upon turbulent regime over the membrane (tangential velocity equal to vt = 2.55 m s−1, corresponding 
to Reynolds number NRe = 1.3 × 104). The striking difference in the permeability coefficients between 
pure water and OMWST-2 (36.2%–  39.0% for NRe = 1.3 × 104 − 2.6 × 104) shall be attributed to 
concentration polarization and fouling resist ance taking place on the boundary region of the RO 
membrane (Table 4) [25,26]. A guided focus on Ta ble 4 permits us to note that reduction of the 
concentration polarization ( RCP) on the RO membrane equal to 26.3%  was provided upon an increment 
of the turbulence on the membrane to values of NRe = 2.6 × 104. 
Secondly, membrane fouling was examin ed by calculating the fouling index ( b) at every operating 
condition during diafiltration run time. With this purpose, the experimental permeate flux data were 
fitted with the threshold flux equation pr oposed by Field and Pearce (2011) [27]: 
ܬ௧	=ܬ୲୦+( ܬ଴−ܬ୲୦)∙݁ି௕௧−ܽ∙ݐ  (2)
where the variable b is the reversible fouling index (h−l) and a the long-term irreversible fouling 
parameter (L h−1 m−2 bar−1), J0 is the initial permeate flux (L h−1 m−2) that can be easily calculated 
through Equation (1), Jt is the permeate flux at a given time (L h−1 m−2) and Jth represents the threshold 
flux (L h−1 m−2), being b, a and Jth fitting parameters obtained simultaneously by a non-linear 
parameter estimation method [28–31]. The b index takes into account th e fouling developed on the 
membrane during operation time that can be periodical ly washed to recover the initial permeability ( K) 
of the membrane [32,33], meanwhile the a parameter accounts for the irreversible fouling unavoidably 
attained on the membrane that makes the initial pe rmeability to steadily decrease during the membrane 
service lifetime in a minor or major degree, t hus establishing the module substitution periodicity. 
Results are given in Table 5, showing that medium  operating pressure should be chosen (25 bar) 
upon turbulent regime over the membrane (5.09 m s−1, that is NRe = 2.6 × 104) to achieve significant 
steady state permeate flux (21.1 L h−1 m−2) and minimize membrane fouling ( b index equal to 0.32), 
ensuring less than 14.7% permeate flux drop and up to 90% feed recovery.

Finally, selectivity of the selected RO membrane  was modelized by means of the Spiegler-Kedem 
model: 
ܴ௜= ஢೔∙௉౐౉
௉౐౉ାஒ೔ (3)
which allows prediction of the rejection efficiency of the solute i (Ri) as function of the net pressure 
(PTM = ΔP − Δπ) as well as two parameters: the first is the reflection coefficient σi that indicates the Membranes 2013 , 3 293 
 
 maximum rejection capability of the RO membrane (0 < σi < 1) and the second is βi which is a fitting 
constant [32,33]. Both parameters, estimated si multaneously by non-linear parameter estimation 
method, are reported in Table 6 togeth er with the rejection efficiency values achieved for EC and  
COD [28,29]. Accurate prediction of  the experimental EC and COD rejection was attained by the 
Spiegler-Kedem model, a nd regression coefficients R2 equal to 0.99 and 0.98 were obtained 
respectively. Minimum rejectio n coefficients for COD and EC  equal to 99.1% and 98.1% were 
measured in the permeate stream. This ensured that  the parametric values were maintained below 
standard limits established to reus e the regenerated effluent in the ol ives washing machines of the olive 
oil production process.

A simplified economical balance of the treatment  process was performed based on a daily amount 
of 10 m3 OMW-2 on average. In our former studies [6,22], the secondary treatment process was 
presented as an economically advantageous AOP, pr oviding high mineralizati on of the recalcitrant 
organic matter present in the raw effluent [34]. Estimated operating costs of approximately 2.4 € m−3 
for conductive-diamond elect rochemical oxidation, 8.5 € m−3 for ozonation and 0.7 € m−3 for  
Fenton-like process highlight the latter as the most  cost-effective one. Furthermore, filtration through 
olive stones is costless [23]. 
Under the best operating conditions studied for the final RO operation, si gnificant steady-state 
permeate flux production was attained (21.1 L h−1 m−2) and the constant fouling parameter a was 
estimated to be −0.08 L h−2 m−2 bar−1. The a parameter takes into account the irreversible fouling 
irretrievably attained on the RO membrane that st eadily reduces its virgin permeability and therefore 
has direct implications in the module substitution peri odicity. A membrane lifetime over 5 years can be 
ensured for a mean daily operating time equal to 10 h and taking into consideration that the olive oil 
campaign, when the OMW-2 is generated, lasts 90 days a year on average. The minimum required 
membrane area is equal to 47.4 m2 for the daily volume of OMW-2 treated. This implies the need of 
two RO membrane modules of 32 m2 surface each. The modules would wo rk in parallel configuration: 
one in service, whereas the other would be in clean ing protocol when the diafiltration cycle finishes. 
This means an overdesign of 26% of the required membrane surface. Energy costs were fixed at  
0.10 € kWh−1, whereas membrane module and housing were equal to 22 € m−2 and 380 €. Pumps, 
piping and instrumentation of the RO membrane pl ant represent approximately 50% of the membrane 
housing costs, whereas facility space needs and services represent 15% of total costs [35,36]. 
Finally, the total expenses of the whole integrated  OMW-2 treatment process, taking into account 
the final purification of the efflue nt by the selected TFC RO membra ne and the secondary treatment, 
are given in Table 7, and the physicochemical characte ristics of the final perm eate stream are reported 
in Table 8. The proposed integrated treatment permits  us to close the loop of the olive oil production 
process (Figure 5), rending it environmentally respectfu l (Figure 6) and boosting its cost-effectiveness. Membranes 2013 , 3 294

 4. Conclusions 
Performance modelization and preliminary cost anal ysis of a final reverse osmosis (RO) treatment 
was examined on a pilot scale for ulterior purificatio n of the effluents genera ted by olive oil factories 
working with the two-phase olive oil extraction procedure. The goal was closing the loop of the 
industrial production process of  an olive oil mill in the premises of Jaén (Spain), where a secondary 
treatment comprising Fenton-like oxidation, floccu lation and filtration through olive stones has been 
successfully set-up. 
Reduction of concentration polarization on the RO membrane equal to  26.3% was provided upon 
increment of the turbulence over the membrane to values of Reynolds number equal to 2.6 × 104. 
Medium operating pressure (25 bar) helped achieve significant steady state permeate flux (21.1 L h−1 m−2) 
and minimize membrane fouling, ensuring less th an 14.7% flux drop and up to 90% feed recovery. 
Under these conditions, less than 0.08 L h−2 m−2 bar−1 irreversible fouling was measured, increasing 
the longevity of the membranes and reducing the capit al and operating costs of the treatment. Finally, 
47.4 m2 required membrane area and 0.87 € m−3 total costs were estimated for the RO process on a 
daily basis of 10 m3 OMW-2. The proposed integrated process pe rmits us to close th e loop of olive oil 
production, rending it environmentally respect ful and boosting its cost-effectiveness.
