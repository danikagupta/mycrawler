Abstract  
Dyes may be defined as substances that, when applied to a substrate provides colour. Dyes are classified 
according to their application and chemical structure, and are composed of a group of atoms known as 
chromophores. The most comm on auxochromes are amine, carboxyl, sulfonate and hydroxyl. 
Interestingly, the widespread use of synthetic colorants and the modern dye industry dates only to 1856 
with the synthesis of mauveine by W.H. Perkin. The existence of sulphur, naphthol, dyes from  vats, 
nitrates, acetic acid, soaps, enzymes, compounds containing chromium, and copper, arsenic, lead, 
cadmium, mercury, nickel, and cobalt are examples of heavy metals. The textile effluent is extremely 
harmful due to a number of auxiliary chemicals used  jointly. These organic substances combine with 
various disinfectants, particularly chlorine and form undesired by products (DBPs), which are frequently 
carcinogenic. If this effluent is allowed to flow through the fields, it plugs the soil pores and reduc es soil 
production. An overview of impact of dyes on human health and the environment is provided in this 
paper .

Introduction  
Dyes may be defined as substances that, when applied to  a substrate provides colour by a 
process that alters, at least temporarily, any crystal structure of the coloured substances 
(Bafana, A. et al., 2011)  [3]. Such substances with considerable colouring capacity are widely 
employed in the textile, pharmaceut ical, food, cosmetics, plastics, photographic and paper 
industries (Zollinger, H 1987; Carneiro P. A., et al . 2007 ) [33, 34]. The dyes can adhere to 
compatible surfaces by solution, by forming covalent bond or complexes with salts or metals, 
by physical ad sorption or by mechanical retention (Kirk -Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical 
Technology 2004; Bafana, A., et al . 2011) [21, 3]. Dyes are classified according to their 
application and chemical structure, and are composed of a group of atoms known as 
chromopho res, responsible for the dye colour . These chromophore -containing centers are 
based on diverse functional groups, such as AZO , anthraquinone, methine, nitro, arilmethane, 
carbonyl and others. In addition, electrons withdrawing or donating substituents so a s to 
generate or intensify the color of the chromophores are denominated as auxochromes. The 
most common auxochromes are amine, carboxyl, sulfonate and hydroxyl ( Christie R. 2001 , 
Dos Santos A. B., et al . 2007) [11, 35]. The manufacture and use of dyes and  pigments is a 
multibillion -dollar industry (Bumpus, J. A. 2004) [4]. The use of these substances is an integral 
part of almost all manufacturing processes. Interestingly, the widespread use of synthetic 
colorants and the modern dye industry dates only to 1856 with the synthesis of mauveine by 
W.H. Perkin (Kirk -Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 1992) [20]. 
Approximately 40,000 different synthetic dyes and pigments are used industrially, and about 4 , 
50,000  tons of dyestuffs are produced worldwide. AZO dyes are the largest and more versatile 
class of dyes, accounting for up to 50% of the annual production (Zollinger, H. 1987) [33]. They 
are extensively used in many fields of up -to-date technology, in e.g., various branches of the 
textile industry, th e leather tanning industry, paper production, food, colour photography, 
pharmaceuticals and medicine, cosmetic, hair colourings, wood staining, agricultural, 
biological and chemical research, light -harvesting arrays, and photo electrochemical cells 
(Kuhad et al. 2004; Couto 2009) [22, 10].

 Moreover, synthetic dyes have been employed for the 
efficacious control of sewage and wastewater  treatment, for 
the determination of specific surface area of activated sludge 
for ground water tracing, etc.  
The largest co nsumer of these dyes is the textile industry, 
accounting for 2/3rds of its market. Different classes of dyes 
are used according to the fibres to which they can be applied. 
Reactive dyes are most commonly used as they can be applied 
to both in natural (wool , cotton, silk) and synthetic (modified 
actylics) fibres (O'Neill et al. 1999) [27]. Reactive dyes differ 
from other class of dyes in that their molecules contain one or 
more reactive groups capable of forming a covalent bond with 
a compatible fibre group.  They have become very popular due 
to their high wet -fastness, brilliance and range of hues (Hao et 
al. 2000) [13]. Their use has increased as synthetic fibres 
became more abundant. Acid and basic dyes are used for 
dyeing all natural fibres (wool, cotton, silk) and some 
synthetics (polyesters, acetylic  and rayon). Direct dyes are 
classified this way because they are applied directly to 
cellulose fibres. Furthermore, they are used for colouring 
rayon, paper, and leather and to small extent nylon. The 
applica tion of mordant dyes is limited to the colouring of 
wool, leather, furs and anodised aluminium. Solvent dyes are 
used for colouring inks, plastics, and wax, fat and mineral oil 
products. One of the significant industries that produce a lot 
of industrial ef fluents is the textile sector. Any fabric's main 
draw is its colour. Because of this, the production and use of 
synthetic dyes for fabric dyeing has grown significantly. 
Many different colourfast, vibrant hues are now available 
thanks to synthetic dyes. Ho wever, Env ironmentalists are 
quite concerned about their toxicity. Using synthetic colours 
has a negative impact on all life forms.  
 
Impact of Chemical Dyes on Human Health  
Most of the dyestuffs at present used in textile dyeing and 
finishing are risky to human health at the levels of exposure 
that workers generally face in the factories. However, with 
long term or accidental over exposure, there can be likely 
health hazards and all dyes and chemicals must consequently 
be treated with care. The most common hazard of reactive 
dyes is respiratory problems due to the inhalation of dye 
particles. Sometimes they can affect a person’s immune 
system and in extreme cases this can mean that when the 
person next inhales the dye their body can react dramatically. 
This is called respiratory sensitization and symptoms include 
itching, watery eyes, sneezing and symptoms of asthma such 
as coughing and wheezing (Hassaan, M. A. 2016) [14]. Despite 
its undeniable importance, this industrial sector is one of the 
biggest global polluters and it consumes high amount of fuel 
and chemicals (Hao O. J. 2000) [13]. The special emphasis is 
placed on the enormous use of drinking water in various 
operations of its production chain, such as washing, 
bleaching, dyeing among others ( Hossain,  M.S., et al. 2018 ) 
[36]. 
The acute toxicity to textile dyes is caused by oral ingestion 
and inhalation, especially by the exposure to dust (Clark, M. 
(ed.). 2011) [8], triggering irritation to the skin and eyes 
(Christle, R. M. 2007) [6]. The workers, who  produce or 
handle reactive dyes, may have contact dermatitis, allergic 
conjunctivitis, rhinitis, occupational asthma or other allergic 
reaction (Hunger, K. 2003) [17]. The latter  are the result of the 
formation of a conjugate between human serum albumin a nd 
the reactive dye, which acts as an antigen (Christle, R. M. 
2007) [6] producing immunoglobulin E antibodies, which 
combine with histamine (Hunger, K. 2003) [17]. Some AZO dye components such as benzidine have been 
linked to cancers of human bladder. Als o, there is a higher 
incidence of bladder cancer in dye workers  exposed to AZO 
dyes (5). Therefore, AZO dyes pose lethal effects, 
genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity to humans as 
well as animals (Puvaneswari, N., et al., 2006; Correia, V. M., 
et al. 1994; Chung, K. T. 2016) [28, 9, 7] 
 
Impact of Chemical Dyes on Environment  
Textile industries produce large amounts of liquid wastes. 
These textile effluents contain organic and inorganic 
compounds (Elliott, A. et al . 1954) [12]. During the dyeing 
processes, not all dyes that are applied to the fabrics are fixed 
on them and there is always a portion of these dyes that 
remains unfixed to the fabrics and gets washed out. These 
unfixed dyes are found to be in high concentrations in textile 
effluents (Ha ssaan, M. A. & El Nemr, A. 2017) [15]. The 
amount of water consumed and released also varies depending 
on the type of fabrics produced (Ananthashankar, R. 2012) [1]. 
The usage of cotton has been increasing constantly throughout 
the past century (UNCTAD 200 3) [32]. Cotton fibres are 
mainly dyed using AZO dyes which are one of the largest 
groups of synthetic colorants used in the industry (Mohan, V., 
et al . 2002) [25]. AZO dyes are difficult to degrade by the 
current conventional treatment processes. They are  
characterized by the presence of the nitrogen -nitrogen bond ( -
N=N -) in the centre and hence they are highly electron 
deficient (Robert, L., et al. 2008) [29]. 
These AZO dyes are found to be complex in nature and have 
been found to show carcinogenic eviden ces on reductive 
cleavage. These dyes are capable of altering the physical and 
chemical properties of soil, deteriorating water bodies and 
causing harm to the flora and fauna in the environment 
(UNCTAD 2003) [32]. It was observed that the toxic nature of 
dyes causes death to the soil micro -organisms  which in turn 
affect the agricultural productivity (Savin, I. and Butnaru, R. 
2008) [31]. AZO dyes are stable in light and resistant to 
microbial degradation or fading away due to washing. 
Therefore, AZO dyes ar e not readily removed from waste 
water by conventional waste water treatment methods. It has 
been estimated that about 10% of the dyestuff in the dyeing 
process of textiles do not bind to fibers and are, therefore, 
released to the environment (Puvaneswari,  N., et al ., 2006; 
Hildenbrand, S. F., et al., 1999) [28, 16]. 
In textile dyeing, various salts are used providing significant 
difficulties for biodegradable microbial communities. The 
reason is that high saline concentrations can cause 
plasmolysis (Meng, X., et al . 2012) [24], that is, lead the 
cytoplasm to lose water and contract, such that the plasma 
membrane gradually separates from the cell wall (King, T., et 
al. 2001) [19]. The discharge of this effluent into the aquatic 
reservoir affects its biochemi cal oxygen demand (BOD), 
chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids 
(TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), and pH. The release of 
the effluents without any remedial treatment will generate a 
gigantic peril to the aquatic ecosystem (Islam, T., et al. 2023) 
[18]. 
 
Future Perspectives  
In order to effectively address the growing production and use 
of synthetic dyes while also considering how they affect the 
environment, coloured effluents must first undergo effective 
and practical treatment procedures b efore being released into 
the environment as waste. Synthetic dyes are biodegraded by 
using various bacteria in rivers and separated enzymes are a 
promising strategy both individually and in combination with  
~ 107 ~ International Journal of Home Science  https://www.homesciencejournal.com  
 conventional treatments.  
Conclusion  
Despite the prohibited agreements (Christle, R. M. 2007) [6], 
of the 400 dyes that have been investigated for their toxicity, 
more than 100 of them with potential for the formation of 
carcinogenic amines are still available on the market 
(Asthana, V., & Shukla, A. C. 2014) [2]. In several regions of 
the globe, such as in India, export demands associated with 
cheap labour determine the existence of small scale textile 
factories that clandestinely release toxic dyes into water 
bodies (Lacasse, K., & Baumann, W. 2012) [23]. 
 It was reported that the synthetic textile dyes exhibited a 
great group of organic compounds that could have many 
impacts on the environment, as well as, some of them can 
cause hazards to humans. The growing complication  and 
struggles in treating texti le wastes has led to a continuous 
examination for new approaches that are applicable and 
economically feasible. However, till now, there is no very 
highly effective technique capable of complete removal of 
both the colour and the toxic properties of the dy es released 
into the environment .
