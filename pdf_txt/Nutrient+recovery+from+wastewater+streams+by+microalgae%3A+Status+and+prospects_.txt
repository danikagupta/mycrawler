ABSTRACT
Microalgae have been identified as one of the most promising sources for future wastewater
treatment and generate many valuable products. Photosynthetic microalgae utilize energy from thesun and assimilate nutrients like carbon (C), N and P from wastewater. Microalgae can grow
rapidly in wastewater and produce biomass that can be used to produce biofuels, fine chemical
products, and bio-fertilizers. This study was conducted to investigate the nutrient recovery fromwastewater through microalgae biological uptake. The green microalgae of C. reinhardtii  11/32C
used in this study and cultivated in Bold’s Basal Media (BBM). The algae culture was placed in a
2 liter of photobioreactor for approximately in 14 days. The green C. reinhardtii  11/32C were
cultivated in the following conditions: photoperiod 16 hr light, 8 hr dark (16:8); light intensity
250±5 Em-2s-1; and temperature 20±3
oC which run in triplicates. The liquid samples were
collected every two days over a period of 14 days for T otal Suspended Solids (TSS), VolatileSuspended Solids (VSS), Nitrate (NO
3-), Phosphate (PO43-), Chlorophyll-a, T otal Phosphorus (TP)
and Total Nitrogen (TKN). The results revealed that green microalgae can uptake nutrient at the
rate of 2.13 mg N/l/d and 0.5 mg P/l/d. These results could recover up to 5.9 % and 1.3% of N andP in their cell, respectively.

INTRODUCTION
In a climate change era, sustainability is an essential
principle in natural resources management whichinvolved controlling the environmental impact and
the socio-economics (Brennan and Owende, 2010).
In general, environment quality is declined due tohuman activities. A considerable amount of water
used for agricultural, municipal, and industrial
purposes will generate wastewater that containspollutants, including nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
(P) (Cai et al., 2013). In addition to the wastewater
generation, the global human sewage contributesapproximately 87% and 88% in forms of N and P ,
respectively (Morée et al.,  2013). These portions mustbe managed and treated correctly, which otherwise
will cause eutrophication in the water bodies.
Therefore, it is worth to explore the possibility toharvest any quantity of N and P from wastewater
through nutrient recovery in microalgae cell to
achieve long-term sustainability and to improvesurface water quality (Yulistyorini, 2016).
Concerning global nutrient requirement, as well
as renewable energy and water reuse formwastewater, microalgae are the robust
microorganisms to recover nutrient and carbon from
various wastewater type to produce biomassfeedstock for biofertiliser or even for biofuel
(Brennan and Owende, 2010; Cai et al.,  2013;
Batstone et al.,  2015; Mo and Zhang, 2013). NutrientMICROALGAE GROWTH AND NUTRIENT RECOVERY OF CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII 1109
recovery from wastewater through microalgae
assimilation is a promising approach to integrate thealgae for the bioremediation of wastewater and the
production of biofuels and added value bio-
products (Yulistyorini, 2016; Unc et al.,  2017).
This study aims to investigate the ability of the
green freshwater microalgae to recover nutrient in
their cell to produce algal biomass feedstock. Theresearch was conducted under the laboratory-
controlled condition, which focused on nutrient
recovery in the green microalgae cultivated inphotobioreactors.
MATERIALS AND METHOD
The green microalgae of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
11/32C  used as photosynthetic microorganism in
this study. This alga was selected because of its
ability to store the excess of P in their cell (Komine et
al., 2000; Ruiz et al.,  2001). C.reinhardtii 11/32C was
cultivated under controlled laboratory conditions
using standard Bold’s Basal Media (BBM) in a 2-litrephotobioreactor (PBRs). The standard BBM
contained a 7.5 mL of 45 g l
-1 NaHCO3 with the
nutrient medium of 42 mg N l-1 and 53 mg P l-1.  The
green C.reinhardtii 13/32C was cultivated in the
following conditions: photoperiod 16 hr light, 8 hr
dark (16:8); light intensity 250±5 Em-2s-1; and
temperature 20±3 oC which run in triplicates.
The liquid samples were collected every two days
for 14 days for Total Suspended Solids (TSS), VolatileSuspended Solids (VSS), Nitrate (NO
3-), Phosphate
(PO43-), Chlorophyll-a, Total Phosphorus (TP) and
Total Nitrogen (TKN) using the methods outlined in(APHA, 2012).RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A well-defined growth pattern of C. reinhardtii 11/
32C cultivated in artificial wastewater (standard
BBM) is shown in Fig. 1a. There was a lag phase of
about two days required by the algae for the newenvironmental adaptation.  The algal biomass
concentration increased exponentially from day two
until day 12 that followed a linear regression ofnatural logarithm organic biomass (ln VSS) was
plotted against cultivation time (d) (see Fig. 1b;
regression coefficient, R
2 = 0.99). In the exponential
growth phase, the rate of specific algal growth ( )
was 0.14 d-1with biomass productivity was 44 mg
VSS L-1 d-1.  As a consequence, these growths were
followed by an increment in N and P uptake in algal
cells and decreased of their concentrations in the
media (Fig. 2).
The graphs reveal that 83% of the NO3- contained
in the media (mean initial concentration of 42 mg N
L-1) was taken up and incorporated in the algal
biomass after 14 days (Fig. 2a).  Simultaneously,
PO43- concentration slightly decreased from 53 to 41
mg P L-1 from which only 22% of PO43- was taken up
by C.reinhardtii 11/32C (Fig. 2b). Under tested
conditions, C.reinhardtii 11/32C was able to uptake
NO3- at 2.13 mg N L-1 d-1 and PO43- at 0.5 mg P L-1 d-1,
which indicates that the microalgae were able to
accumulate 5.8% N and 1.6% P (dry weight).  The
content of N and P in the algal cells was validated byEnergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
analysis. Figure 3 below shows that N and P
contents in algal cells cultivated after 14 days were5.9% and 1.3% respectively , confirming
experimental results.

C. reinhardtii  11/32C used in this study due to its
molecular development and genetic tools that useful
in various studies. They have flagella structure and
function, chloroplast, photosynthetic mechanismand can grow under stress conditions (Harris, 2001;
Harris, 2008). This study revealed its ability to
recover N and P from synthetic growth media.Under the favourable environment, 83% of N-NO
3-
and 22% of P-PO43- were removed from the media,
C.reinhardtii  11/32C stored 5.9% and 1.3% for N and
P respectively. This evidence conceded that
phycoremediation offers advantages in removing
pollutant from wastewater and convert them as Nand P content in microalgae cells (Shahid et al.,  2020).
The biomass may contain highly valuable
substance,including polyunsaturated fatty acids,pigments, carbohydrates, amino acids, and high
sugar content (Shahid et al.,  2020; Levasseur et al.,
2020). C.reinhardtii  11/32C cultivated in
photobioreactors also shown better in removing
nutrients than C. reinhardtii  grew in an Erlenmeyer
flask using synthetic wastewater, which wasreported to remove 42-55% N and 12-13% P (Kong et
al., 2010).
The use of NO
3- as a sole nitrogen source in
preliminary tests shown that C.reinhardtii  11/32Ccan assimilate nitrate as inorganic nitrogen and not
only ammonium. This reaction presented that
C.reinhardtii  11/32C can use as consortium
microorganism with nitrifying bacteria. Vargas,Donoso-Bravo (2016),reported that nitrifying
bacteria oxidized NH
4+ to NO3- in raw wastewater
up to 60%, while microalgae assimilated 40% ofnitrate in a steady-state condition.Moreover, the
mechanisms for nitrate metabolisms include the
transportation of NO
3- into the cell where nitrate
reductase (NR) catalyzed reduction to NO2- which
eventually is transported into the chloroplast. Then
nitrite reductase (NiR) helped to catalyze furtherreduction to  NH
4+ to form carbon skeleton (Cai et al.,
2013). It means that C.reinhardtii  11/32C have
enough energy to perform the reduction process intheir cells.
Furthermore, these findings also proved that
C.reinhardtii  11/32C could uptake nutrients from its
surrounding environment and to stored reserves at
over 1% of P dry weight in their cells.  This reserve
of P is stored inside the cells as polyphosphategranules (Eixler et al., 2006); in this study,  luxurious
P uptake was confirmed to take place under non-
stress environmental conditions (i.e., no limitinggrowth conditions).MICROALGAE GROWTH AND NUTRIENT RECOVERY OF CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII 1111
CONCLUSION
In the present study, synthetic media was used as a
source of nutrients for microalgae cultivation to
mimic wastewater as a source of nutrient for
microalgae growth. C.reinhardtii  11/32C can
effectively assimilate the nutrient for their growth
and store the organic nitrogen and phosphorus in
their cell. The nutrient uptake rate reached at 2.13mg N L
-1 d-1 and at 0.5 mg P L-1 d-1 for N and P
respectively in which generated N and P content of
5.9% and 1.3 %. C.reinhardtii  11/32C revealed to be
able to accomplish luxurious P uptake under the
non-stress condition and proved their possibility to
use the microalgae system to retrofit in the existingwastewater treatment.
