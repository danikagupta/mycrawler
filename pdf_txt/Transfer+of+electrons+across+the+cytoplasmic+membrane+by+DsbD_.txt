Similar results were obtained using the complemen- the periplasm. The process involves the passage of re-

The complex with thioredoxin was more abundant domain contains a pair of cysteines essential for these
reactions. The finding that cytoplasmic TrxA forms a when cysteine 285 was mutated (Figure 6, lanes 11 and

position 163 indicates a direct interaction between these the formation of this mixed disulfide is due to an attack
on oxidized thioredoxin by cysteine 163. This would be two proteins (Figure 8). The reducing equivalents gener-

Our results are consistent with a mechanism in which thioredoxin reductase mutant ( trxB2). Consistent with
our proposal, we observed a substantial increase in the the reducing equivalents are passed from cytoplasmic

Nevertheless, in the wild-type situation, of the thiore- termediate between TrxA and the bportion of DsbD may
be the result of the reduction of a disulfide bond between doxin±DsbD pair, it is thioredoxin which is the reductant.
Therefore, a variant of thioredoxin mutated in the less cysteines at positions 163 and 285. Although we have
not been able to demonstrate this directly, the fact that reactive cysteine (cysteine 36) should still be able to
form the mixed disulfide with bg. In agreement with this these cysteines become inaccessible to AMS in a trxA

While this proposal seemed reasonable at the time, per- cysteines 163 and 285. How do these residues become

duction indicates that two thioredoxin-folds (those of electron acceptor on the opposite side of the cyto-
plasmic membrane? We can imagine at least two ways DsbD and DsbC in this case) cannot interact with each
other. In fact, there are no examples in the literature of in which this might take place. First, Cys-163 and Cys-
285 could be positioned in a channel-like structure that such interactions.
In our model, the thioredoxin-like domain appears to can be accessed from both sides of the lipid bilayer.
Second, the reduction of the Cys-163-Cys-285 disulfide have the unusual role of shuttling reducing potential

such that the free sulfhydryl moves to a position closer there are examples in which active thioredoxins and
their cognate reductases are combined in one hybrid to the periplasmic face of the membrane. There, it may
become available to promote further transfer of reducing polypeptide, as is the case of the thioredoxin system

These and other examples indicate that inany of these thiol-redox reactions between two differentproteins, the reaction can proceed in either direction.Our results suggest that this is also the case for DsbD.In the absence of a cytoplasmic source of reducingpotential, DsbD can initiate a nucleophilic attack on thenormally reducing TrxA. Whether or not this reactionever occurs in wild-type cells remains to be studied.
Our data suggest that DsbD uses a single mechanism
to reduce all of its substrates in the periplasm. Thisinterpretation is supported by the fact that proteins withdiverse functions, such as DsbC and CcmG, form mixed
disulfides with DsbD via the cysteine at position 109.We presume that DsbD also uses this residue to interact
