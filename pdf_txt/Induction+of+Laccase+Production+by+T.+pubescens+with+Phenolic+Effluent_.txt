Various culture parameters were optimised for laccase synthesis by Trametes pubescens MB89, including pH, carbon source,
nitrogen source, lignocellulosic supplements, and reported inducers. Glucose, in conjunction with a complex nitrogen source at
pH 5.0, resulted in the highest laccase yield. Adding ethanol, copper, or 2,5-xylidine prior to inoculation further improved laccase
concentrations. The addition of 2,5-xylidine was further investig ated with multiple additions applied at varying times. This novel
application substantially improved laccase production when applied regularly from inoculation and during the growth phase,
and also countered glucose repression of laccase synthesis. Single and multiple factor changes were studied in three distillery
wastewaters and a wine lees. A synergistic increase in laccase synthesis was observed with the addition of glucose, copper, and2,5-xylidine. Single addition of 2,5-xylidine proved most beneﬁcial with distillery wastewaters, while copper addition was most
beneﬁcial when using the wine lees as a culture medium.
1. Introduction
Laccase and various microorganisms that produce the en-
zyme have been studied intensively due to their potential ap-plications in industrial and remediative processes. However,one of the factors inhibiting the application of laccase is thecost associated with using large quantities of the enzyme.A possible strategy is to improve laccase yields using wastesubstrates as a culture media for solid or submerged fer-mentations. Numerous studies have investigated the mostfavourable conditions for laccase production by variousfungi with solid and submerged fermentations [ 1]. The pro-
duction of laccase is dependent on a number of factors,which include the strain of microorganism (or genetic ma-nipulation thereof), the composition of the culture medium(compounds that provide a nitrogen and carbon source orthat act as inducers), the cultivation method (solid substrateor submerged), and the culture conditions (oxygen availabil-
ity, pH, temperature). Laccase is generally produced in ap-
preciable concentrations during the idiophase, where growthremains static due to a decrease in available substrate, butmay be signiﬁcantly enhanced by adding inducer com-
pounds. In order to provide laccase in the quantities requiredand at a low cost, it is vital that yields are increased or thatproduction costs are reduced [ 2].
A variety of agroindustrial waste residues may be utilized
to produce laccase and thereby lower the substrate costs in-volved in production. Barley bran [ 3] ,ac o m m o nw a s t ef r o m
the brewing industry, chestnut shell waste from glac ´e chest-
nut production [ 4], banana skins [ 5], mandarin peels [ 6],
kiwi fruit wastes [ 7], grape seeds [ 8], and distillery wastew-
aters [ 9] have all been assessed as substrates for laccase syn-
thesis using white rot fungi. Distillery wastewaters are par-ticularly attractive for monocultures as they can be consid-ered as a sterilised growth medium, notably lowering costsassociated with heat sterilisation. Although these waste sub-strates have been investigated as potential substrates forlaccase production, this needs to be taken further and laccaseyields using waste residues need to be increased. Minoradjustments to the culture conditions, supplementation, orinducer addition could signiﬁcantly improve laccase produc-
tion when utilizing waste substrates.2 Enzyme Research
Inducers are compounds that signiﬁcantly increase lac-
case production while occurring at concentrations that areextremely low relative to available carbon sources. Many in-ducers are phenolic or aromatic compounds related to ligninor are lignin derivatives. Non-phenolic compounds such asethanol [ 11]a n dm e t a li o n ss u c ha sc o p p e r[ 12,13]h a v e
also increased laccase synthesis. The presence of the inducer
(or possibly its metabolite) and the availability of coppercan trigger signiﬁcant increases in laccase productivity inresponse to environmental conditions. The extent to whichlaccase synthesis is enhanced depends upon the inducer’sconcentration and its time of addition [ 1]. If it occurs at
too low a concentration then no e ﬀect is observed, while a
toxic e ﬀect (growth inhibition) is often observed when the
concentration is too high. Although the time at which asinducer is added does a ﬀect laccase synthesis, the majority of
studies add the compound prior to inoculation. Fungal gen-era di ﬀer markedly regarding laccase stimulus by inducers.
The inductive e ﬀect also depends on very small di ﬀerences in
molecular structure, as large di ﬀerences in enzyme synthesis
have been noted for very similar compounds [ 10].
The objective of this study was to enhance laccase syn-
thesis by Trametes pubescens MB89 with pH adjustment,
carbon and nitrogen supplementation, and the addition ofa variety of reported inducers at two time periods. The moststimulatory compound was then assessed further using dif-ferent numbers of additions, at di ﬀerent times to determine
which would have the greatest positive impact on enzymeyields. The changes or additions that resulted in increasedlaccase synthesis were assessed in wine-related wastewaters to
establish whether the improvements would have a universal
eﬀect or if they were particular to a speciﬁc culture medium.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. The E ﬀect of pH, Di ﬀerent Carbon, Nitrogen, and Lignin/
Cellulose Substrates on Laccase Synthesis. The optimal pH
was assessed using a full-strength distillery wastewater (COD29.5 g/L, total phenolic compounds 280 mg/L, and pH 3.75)adjusted to 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 using hydrochloricacid or Na
2CO 3powder (both Saarchem, uniLAB, Merck).
Aliquots of 65 mL of the wastewater were placed in 250 mLErlenmeyer ﬂasks, covered with aluminium foil (to preventcontamination), and autoclaved for ﬁfteen minutes. Dupli-cate ﬂasks were inoculated with T. pub es c e ns MB89 (0 .87
±
0.28 g/L) from stock cultures grown in a liquid culture con-
taining 2% malt extract, 1% glucose, and 0.2% yeast extract( a l lM e r c k ,B i o l a b )a tp H5 . 5 .
Diﬀerent carbon sources in the form of fructose, glucose,
mannitol, maltose, sucrose, cellobiose, and lactose (all Saar-chem, univAR, Merck) were added to a low-strength brandydistillery wastewater (COD 10.5 g/L, total phenolic com-pounds 35 mg/L, and pH 3.9) to assess their individual e ﬀects
on laccase synthesis. The amount added was equivalent to themolar equivalent of carbon atoms in 10 g/L of glucose. Di ﬀer-
ent nitrogen sources in the form of NH
4NO 3,N H 4Cl, KNO 3
(Saarchem, univAR, Merck), and H 2NCNH 2(analaR, BDH)
were added at a molar equivalent of nitrogen atoms in 2 g/Lof KNO 3, while malt extract, yeast extract, and peptone were
added at 2 g/L. Cellulose and lignin-containing supplementsin the form of cellulose powder, blue gum powder, rooibostea leaves ( Aspalathus linearis ), and sugarcane bagasse were
added at 1 g/L, and phosphorus (H
3PO 4, 50 mM) was as-
sessed. In all cases, the wastewater pH was adjusted to 5.0
using sodium carbonate powder. Aliquots of 65 mL of the so-
lutions were placed in 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks, coveredwith aluminium foil (to prevent contamination), and auto-claved for ﬁfteen minutes. Triplicate ﬂasks were inoculatedwith T.pubescens MB89 (1.27
±0.31 g/L) from the stock
cultures described above. The ﬂasks were placed in a shakingincubator (Labcon) at 150 rpm at 28
◦C for 15 days. Control
samples were inoculated in the media containing no stim-ulatory compounds. Samples were taken from the ﬂasks atleast every second day, centrifuged in 1.5 mL Eppendorf con-tainers at 9660 g for two minutes (Heraeus Biofuge, Ger-many) and the supernatant was diluted appropriately andtested for laccase activity using the ABTS assay as describedin [9].
2.2. The E ﬀect of Reported Inducers
2.2.1. Addition Prior to Inoculation. All inducers were as-
sessed in 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 65 mL ofa synthetic medium containing: 2% glucose (Saarchem,uniLAB, Merck), 0.3% peptone, 0.3% malt extract (both Bio-lab, Merck), KH
2PO 4(1 g/L), Na 2HPO 4·2H 2O (100 mg/L),
MgSO 4·7H 2O (500 mg/L), CaCl 2(10 mg/L), FeSO 4·7H 2O
(10 mg/L), MnSO 4·4H 2O (1 mg/L), ZnSO 4·7H 2O (1 mg/L),
and CuSO 4·5H 2O (2 mg/L) (all Saarchem, uniLAB, Merck).
Reported inducers in the form of 3,4-dimethoxybenzylalcohol, 2,5-xylidine (2,5-dimethylalinine), syringic acid,hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), violuric acid (all Fluka, SigmaAldrich Ltd, Cape T own), guaiacol, p-coumaric acid, 2,6-
dichloroindophenol (DI), quercetin dehydrate, o-cresol, gal-
lic acid (all Sigma), n-hydroxyphthalimide , 4-methylcatechol
(both Aldrich), phenol, phenol red, and copper sulphate (allSaarchem, uniLAB, Merck) were all tested at 1 mM, whilecycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich), an antibiotic, was tested at0.1 mM. T annic acid (Sigma), cellulose powder (Aldrich, 20micron diameter), Aspalathus linearis tea leaves, and absolute
ethanol (Merck) were tested at 0.1% (w/v). All reported
inducers, other than ethanol, were autoclaved in the syntheticmedium (pH adjusted to 5.0 individually after the addition ofthe inducer). Absolute ethanol was autoclaved separately andadded immediately prior to adding the inoculum.
2.2.2. Addition Four Days after Inoculation. Autoclaved ﬂasks
containing only the synthetic medium described in Section
2.2.1 were inoculated and placed on a shaking incubator
(Labcon) at 150 rpm at 28
◦C .A f t e rf o u rd a y so fg r o w t h ,
the reported inducers were added individually under asepticconditions. All reported inducers and controls were assessedin triplicate over a 20-day period. Samples of <0.5 mL were
taken every 48 hours, except for 2,5-xylidine—which wassampled daily for the ﬁrst six days after addition and every48 hours thereafter.Enzyme Research 3
2.2.3. Multiple Additions of 2,5-Xylidine. One reported in-
ducer, 2,5-xylidine, was additionally tested in the syntheticmedium by varying the both time and number of additions.It was added aseptically such that the concentration increasedby 1 mM with each addition. One, two, or three doses wereadministered at 48-hour intervals. Dosing commenced at
different times after inoculation (see Ta bl e 3 ,Section 3.2.2
for the exact times and numbers of addition ) to determine theeﬀects of dosing during di ﬀerent stages of the growth cycle.
2.3. Laccase Synthesis in Modiﬁed Wine-Related Wastewaters.
Four wastewaters were obtained from a winery and two dis-tilleries near Worcester in the Western Cape Province ofSouth Africa and stored at 4
◦C. After assessment for growth
inhibition, two distillery wastewaters were tested at fullstrength, while two of the wastewaters (a wine lees and a dis-tilled wine lees after tartaric acid extraction) were tested
at 30% concentration. Wastewater controls consisted of the
raw, unadjusted wastewater. Additions of 2% glucose, 1 mMcopper sulfate, or three 1 mM additions of 2,5-xylidine wereassessed in the four wastewaters. In addition, a synergisticreaction was studied by combining pH adjustment, glucose,copper, and 2,5-xylidine addition. Triplicate ﬂasks of all wast-ewaters were inoculated with biomass of Trametes pubescens
MB89 (0.76
±0.25 g/L) from the stock cultures described
above. The ﬂasks containing the wastewater samples wereplaced on a benchtop shaker (Labcon SP015 + UPF75, Mar-aisburg) at 150 rpm at 28
◦C for 14 days. Laccase activities
were tested every 48 hours for all ﬂasks except for 2,5-xyli-dine, which was tested every 24 hours for the ﬁrst eight daysand every 48 hours thereafter.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. The E ﬀect of Di ﬀerent Carbon, Nitrogen, and
Lignin/Cellulose Substrates on Laccase Synthesis
3.1.1. pH. Laccase synthesis varied signiﬁcantly over the pH
range tested in the brandy distillery wastewater. A peak inproduction was evident at pH 5.0—as laccase synthesis de-creased by more than 40% at a pH only 0.5 units more acidicand basic ( Figure 1 ). Variations in growth and metabolic
requirements could be attributed to the change in laccaseproduction. A visibly longer lag phase in growth occurredat more acidic pH values, and less mycelia growth was evi-dent. The optimal range for the laccase isoforms secreted bythis fungal strain has been reported between pH 3.0 and 4.5[12], potentially indicating that laccase may be produced and
function optimally under conditions that are not favourableto growth. The presence of inducers may increase laccasesynthesis by providing contact with compounds that maynaturally elicit a stress response and further increase pro-duction. In the current experiment, all of the highest laccaseactivities occurred from day 12 onwards, which is typical ofmany submerged cultures where the highest activities werereported to occur in the secondary growth phase.

tained when fructose, glucose, sucrose, and cellobiose were

used as carbon sources ( Ta bl e 1 ). These sugars all improved
laccase yield 1.7-fold relative to the control. Lactose andmaltose also yielded relatively high laccase production andimproved synthesis 1.5-fold. Mannitol was the only supple-ment that resulted in a relative decrease in laccase synthesis,as these cultures produced approximately half the laccaseproduced in the control. Mannitol di ﬀered from the other
carbon sources in that it was a sugar alcohol (or polyol) andwas not a cyclic compound. Revankar and Lele [ 14]i n v e s t i -
gated the e ﬀect of di ﬀerent carbon sources (glucose, fructose,
sucrose, lactose, starch, and glycerol) on laccase productionbyT. versicolor MTCC138. They observed a 3-fold increase
of laccase production when glucose was used instead of fruc-tose, and starch further improved laccase production by 12%.Although not attempted in this study, Revankar and Lele[14] obtained interesting results when combining starch and
glucose (1 : 1) as carbon sources and further improved lac-case synthesis by 57%. They attributed lower laccase syn-thesis with glucose alone due to glucose repression of en-zyme synthesis but when used in combination with a morecomplex carbon source, the glucose was rapidly utilized forgrowth, while the starch was consumed during stationaryphase and aided laccase production.
3.1.3. Nitrogen Source. The nitrogen source that improved
laccase synthesis to the greatest extent was peptone (1.8-fold increase). Lower yields were obtained with an inorganicnitrogen source. The e ﬀects of inorganic nitrogen upon lac-
case synthesis in this study were corroborated by Revankar
and Lele [ 14], who obtained highest laccase activities by
Trametes versicolor MTCC 138 using a complex nitrogen
source (yeast extract) and also obtained low laccase activitieswhen using inorganic nitrogen sources. In the present study,improved growth resulting from the carbon present in pep-tone may have improved total laccase synthesis.
Although an inorganic nitrogen source such as aspara-
gine aids downstream processes such as enzyme extractionand puriﬁcation [ 15], researchers have observed negligible
growth and laccase secretion when they replaced the complexnitrogen source with asparagine as the sole nitrogen sourceforTrametes pubescens [13]. Literature exists supporting both4 Enzyme Research

high [ 13]a n dl o w[ 16] nitrogen concentrations for enhanc-
ing laccase synthesis, but a high nitrogen concentration isgenerally favoured [ 1]. This has also been demonstrated at a
molecular level, where increasing the nitrogen concentrationin cultures of Trametes versicolor increased in laccase gene
transcription levels [ 17].
3.1.4. Lignin/Cellulose. Trametes pubescens MB89 did not
increase laccase synthesis in response to the four lignin/cellu-lose additions. The main constituent of green rooibos ( Aspal-
athus linearis , used to make a herbal tea) is dihydrochalcone
aspalathin, but it is also known to contain hydroxylated ben-zoic and cinnamic acids, the ﬂavonoids: luteolin, chrysoeriol,quercetin, and isoquercetin [ 18,19]. Sugarcane bagasse is
known to contain an array of phenolic compounds, whichincludes both ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid [ 20]—both
known to be potent laccase inducers in some white-rot fungi[21]. Although plant extracts and lignocellulosic wastes do
contain tannins and phenolic compounds known to enhancelaccase synthesis [ 21,22], the concentrations in the liquid
media may have been too low to elicit a response.
3.2. The E ﬀect of Reported Inducers
3.2.1. Addition Prior to or Four Days after Inoculation. As y n -
thetic media was used to assess a number of reported induc-ers ( Ta bl e 2 ) that were either added before inoculation or
four days thereafter. The greatest increase in laccase synthesisfor both times of addition resulted from 2, 5-xylidine. Gen-erally, the greatest increases in laccase synthesis were ob-served when the stimulatory compounds were added to themedium prior to inoculation. Ethanol and copper were most
beneﬁcial when added prior to inoculation, while 4-meth-ylcatechol and n-hydroxyphthalimide resulted in greatest in-
creases when added four days after inoculation. Gallic acid,tannic acid, and quercetin led to a modest improvement inlaccase activities when added prior to inoculation. The othercompounds elicited no signiﬁcant improvement, or a neg-ative response regarding laccase production. Addition of thereported inducer prior to inoculation could be more e ﬀective
than addition after the biomass is actively growing, as it e ﬀec-
tively exposed a lower biomass concentration to the stim-
ulatory compounds for a longer time period. This was evi-dent for 4-methylcatechol where cell growth was visibly re-duced and grew in a few large clumps instead of a slurry ofﬁne pellets that was evident in nearly all other shake-ﬂaskcultures. The exposure to cycloheximide was fatal, as nochange in the medium pH or laccase activity was observed.
There have been many studies regarding the e ﬀects of in-
ducers using a plethora of fungal genera, species, and evenstrains. Di ﬀerences in laccase stimulation were already ob-
served in very early studies more than half a century ago.F˚ahraeus et al. [ 23] studied the response of a number of fungi
to various laccase inducers. These inducers improved laccaseactivities from various T. versicolor strains, but only guaiacol
induced enzyme synthesis in Stereum hirsutum . Ethanol has
improved laccase synthesis signiﬁcantly when used as a car-bon source [ 24] for a monokaryotic strain Pycnoporus cinna-
barinus ss3. Later work by this group indicated that ethanol
improved gene expression and inhibited protease activity,thereby playing an important regulatory role in laccaseproduction by the fungus [ 25]. Further work performed inEnzyme Research 5

the current study found the combination of copper, 2,5-
xylidine, and glucose enhanced laccase synthesis signiﬁcantly(Section 3.3 ).
3.2.2. Multiple Additions of 2,5-Xylidine. Following on from
the success of 2,5-xylidine at greatly improving laccase titres,the e ﬀects of time of addition and multiple dosing were
assessed to determine whether laccase stimulation could beimproved further. The time of the initial dose and the num-ber of additional doses were varied—as per Ta bl e 3 .T h e
highest relative increases in laccase synthesis were observedfor cultures where the inducer was applied very early in thebatch culture. A single dose of 1mM 2,5-xylidine at the timeof inoculation improved laccase synthesis 7.7-fold. Three
doses of 2,5-xylidine applied from the time of inoculation at
48-hour intervals improved laccase synthesis 10.3-fold. It wasevident that multiple applications of 2,5-xylidine increasedlaccase synthesis to a greater extent than single applications.These increases were most beneﬁcial when added early in thegrowth phase.
Numerous studies have shown 2,5-xylidine to be a potent
inducer amongst a variety of fungal genera [ 3,16,26]. An
8.2-fold increase was observed in laccase synthesis by T. ve r-
sicolor [27], while a 9-fold increase was observed when added
to a culture of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus [28]. However, to
the authors knowledge, the current study is the ﬁrst thatillustrates the e ﬀectiveness of pulsed dosing of an inducer,which resulted in a signiﬁcant improvement in laccase ac-
tivity (33%) compared to the single dose strategy.
Another signiﬁcant ﬁnding was that the presence of 2,5-
xylidine countered glucose repression of laccase synthesis. Inthe control samples, the highest laccase concentrations were
observed in the stationary phase at the end of the fermenta-
tion period; which has been published in prior work [ 9,29].
However, with multiple doses of 2,5-xylidine, laccase expres-sion peaked early in the fermentation period. Some fungi,such as Lentinus edodes , produce high concentrations of
laccase during primary growth (known as constitutive pro-duction). This is advantageous as it shortens the fermenta-tion period [ 22,26]. This is highly advantageous as it may
greatly lower the costs of laccase production in submergedcultures as costs associated with energy and aeration can besigniﬁcantly lowered. Additionally, potential contaminationthat could ruin a lengthier fermentation is less of a concernwhen the product is produced in a shorter time.
3.3. Laccase Synthesis in Modiﬁed Wine-Related Wastewaters.
Raw wastewaters were adjusted to pH 5, supplemented witheither copper, glucose, ethanol, dosed three times with 1 mM2,5-xylidine or supplemented with a combination of glucose,copper and dosed three times with 2,5-xylidine. The initialpH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total phenoliccompounds were measured and displayed in Ta bl e 4 .T h e
high phenolic content of the wine lees would suggest that6 Enzyme Research

represents the average highest laccase activity of the triplicatesamples for each individual modiﬁcation tested in each of thefour wastewaters separately. Of the various modiﬁcations,only the addition of copper, 2,5-xylidine, or the combinationof glucose, copper, and 2,5-xylidine elicited major improve-ments of the laccase yield.
The simultaneous addition of glucose, copper, and 2,5-
xylidine resulted in the greatest increase in laccase synthesisin all four wastewaters. This would be expected as the wast-ewaters now contained carbon, copper (an essential metalcomponent of the enzyme), and a reported inducer. Syner-gistic e ﬀects using 2,5-xylidine and other compounds have
been observed before. F ˚ahraeus et al. [ 23] tested various cop-
per concentrations with and without 2,5-xylidine and ob-served very little di ﬀerence when copper was tested from 0
to 2500 µg/L by itself. However, when copper was tested with
2,5-xylidine, there were large increases in laccase synthesis—illustrating the synergistic e ﬀect when the two inducers were
added simultaneously.
The addition of 2,5-xylidine led to the most signiﬁcant
increases in laccase activity in the two distillery wastewaterst h a tw e r et e s t e da tf u l ls t r e n g t h( Figure 2 ). There was no in-
crease in the two wastewaters that were diluted to a 30% con-centration. Interestingly, the ﬂasks containing 30% wine leesthat were supplemented with 2,5-xylidine were the only onesin which the fungus grew in a single mass instead of loose
pellets and mycelial fragments, indicating a possible physi-ological response to the phenolic compound. However, lac-case synthesis was not improved. The wine lees had the great-
est concentration of phenolic compounds (590 mg/L after
dilution), which could have acted as stimulatory compounds,and thereby lessened the e ﬀect of 2,5-xylidine.
In the current study, laccase repression normally occur-
ring in the presence of excess glucose was countered by theaddition of 2,5-xylidine. The phenolic compound altered lac-case synthesis such that the highest concentration was re-corded earlier in the batch culture, as opposed to idiophasicproduction. When glucose was added as the only modiﬁca-tion, the maximum laccase concentration occurred muchlater (approximately 11.3 days) than it did with the combi-nation of glucose, copper, and 2,5-xylidine (approximately6.1 days).
Copper supplementation only increased laccase synthesis
in the diluted wine lees, where the combination of the metalwith organic acids, sugars, ethanol, and the various phenoliccompounds could have elicited greater enzyme synthesis.Copper addition by itself was of little beneﬁt to any of thedistillery wastewaters. Copper is vital to laccase synthesis asthe enzyme requires four copper atoms to be catalyticallyactive, but lack of an adequate carbon or nitrogen source orinducer may have hampered laccase synthesis. Other studieshave conﬁrmed little di ﬀerence regarding laccase synthesis by
T. versicolor when copper by itself was tested in a range from
0 to 2500 µg/L [ 23].
Glucose addition did not improve laccase yields. Some
studies have found an abundance of glucose inhibits laccasesynthesis. Moreira et al. [ 30] found high glucose concentra-
tions lowered laccase production during secondary metab-olism. They hypothesized that low laccase production wasdue to the low pH resulting from extended primary metab-olism. In the current study, the biomass from the glucose-supplemented wastewaters had of a thick, clear band ofEnzyme Research 7

mucilaginous growth (consistent with an external polysac-
charide layer). When copper and 2,5-xylidine were includedwith glucose, this mucilaginous growth was notably dimin-ished and the solution was less viscous. This suggested thatthe change in physiology during growth resulting from glu-cose would signiﬁcantly a ﬀect laccase production; and the
addition of 2,5 xylidine was beneﬁcial with regard to bothyield and downstream processing.
There was great variability in fungal growth and enzyme
synthesis in wine-related wastewaters. The wine lees and thedistilled wine lees had both inhibited the growth of T. pub es-
cens at full strength. These had to be substantially diluted to
allow for growth, which would render their use impractical
at large-scale. Although there is literature pertaining to the
utilisation of wastewaters as a medium or as a supplement toproduce laccase [ 4,21], there is little that demonstrates sup-
plementation of wastes or wastewaters in order to enhancethe production of laccase by white-rot fungi. A recent pub-lication has illustrated that the addition of 2 mM of coppercould enhance the laccase yield 3-fold using wheat branunder solid substrate fermentation [ 31]. The present study
has shown that signiﬁcant improvements can be achievedin wastewaters with slight modiﬁcations. The two distillerywastewaters that were tested at full strength had substantialincreases in laccase activity when 2,5-xylidine was added byitself, while the 30% wine lees had a signiﬁcant increase withthe addition of 1 mM copper. The most pragmatic strategywould be to adopt a repeated dosage of 2,5-xylidine withthe inclusion of a copper supplement. This would have lowerassociated costs, and the potential for contamination wouldbe signiﬁcantly less than if glucose were also added. Nominalcopper concentrations would be added to ensure that themicroelement was present as laccase synthesis is negligibleif the microelement is not present. It appeared that nosingle factor could be altered to enhance enzyme synthesisover a broad spectrum of wine-related wastewaters. How-ever, it was evident that supplementation with 2,5-xylidine
could signiﬁcantly increase laccase synthesis in full-strength
distillery wastewaters.4. Conclusions
Conditions tested in this study indicated that a number offactors could signiﬁcantly increase laccase synthesis using T.
pubescens in wastewaters. A pH of 5.0, a number of carbon
sources (fructose, glucose, sucrose and cellobiose) and pep-tone all improved laccase concentrations. Under the condi-tions tested, 2,5-xylidine, ethanol, and copper e ﬀectively in-
creased laccase when added prior to inoculation, while 4-
methylcatechol and n-hydroxyphthalimide promoted laccase
synthesis when added later in the growth phase. The additionof 2,5-xylidine was further investigated, and greater laccasesynthesis was achieved using multiple doses applied at theearly growth stage. Another signiﬁcant ﬁnding was that thepresence of 2,5-xylidine countered glucose repression of lac-case synthesis. This is highly advantageous as it may greatlylower the costs of laccase production in submerged cul-tures as costs associated with energy and aeration can besigniﬁcantly lowered. Additionally, potential contaminationthat could ruin a lengthier fermentation is less of a concernwhen the product is produced in a shorter time. The highestlaccase concentrations were produced in all four wastewaterswhen the combination of copper, 2,5-xylidine, and glucosewas added. The two distillery wastewaters that were testedat full strength had a substantial increase in laccase activitywhen supplemented with 2,5-xylidine, while the laccaseconcentration in the 30% wine lees was enhanced by theaddition of 1 mM copper. Although no single factor could bealtered in order to enhance enzyme synthesis over a broadspectrum of wine-related wastewaters, multiple doses of2,5-xylidine could signiﬁcantly increase laccase synthesis indistillery wastewaters.
