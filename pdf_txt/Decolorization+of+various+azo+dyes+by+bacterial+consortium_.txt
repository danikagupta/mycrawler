Abstract : Bioremediation exploiting a variety of microorganisms for the degradation of recalcitrant organics 
appears as an eco -friendly solution to the problem of environmental pollution. Microbes have been talented by 
nature with the ability of degrading a wide variety of environmental pollutants competently with minimum 
amount of sludge production. In this work, we have investigated the decolorization and degradation of a mixture 
of triphenylmethane dyes, Malachite gre en, Crystal Violet and Basic Fuchsin by a bacterial consortium 
separately and in a mixed solution. Decolorization studies were carried out with single dye solution as well as 
mix dye solution with respect to pH, temperature and initial dye concentration. D ecolorized products were 
analyzed with UV -visible spectroscopy and Thin Layer Chromatography, which indicates the process of 
decolorization in this case, is biodegradation . The decolorized products were also checked for level of COD, 
wherefrom it was found  that the decolorized products were completely safe for the environment up to a 
concentration of 100 mg/ L.

I. Introduction  
Water is one of the vital necessities for the continued existence of life on this Earth. The water 
requirement doubles worldwide every 21 years due to the fast increase in the world’s population and the 
industrial activities and additionally, the irregular ity in rainfall in these days [1]. It has been anticipated by 
United Nation that by 2025, 2.7 billion people will be affected by water shortage [2]. Within the next fifty years, 
the world urban population is expected to increase from 3.4 to 6.4 billion [3] and this will give stress to greater 
demands on clean water. It is not only the rising population adding to worldwide water stress, but also, 
industrialization will lead to greater demands for water, resulting in more permanent water scarcity.  
Many indus tries already consume an abundance of water and pollute water sources that could have 
been directed to drinking and sanitary purposes. The textile industry exhausts a heavy  amount of water, utilizing 
80-200 m3 of water per ton of product and producing 1,65 0 m3 of wastewater per day [4 and 5].  Wastewater 
from the textile industry is one of the most polluting of all industrial effluents [6]. Much of the water that is used 
in textile industries is not reusable and difficult to treat because it is contaminated with dyes or color pigments 
which have complex aromatic structures [ 6 and 7].  Along with the dyes, textile wastewater also contains solids, 
oil, many complex organics and high quantities of chemical residue from process such as bleaching and dyeing. 
Intens e color of the textile wastewater is the most serious problem of the textile industrial effluents. The 
discharge from these industries is highly colored as enormous amount of dyes remains unsettled during coloring 
processes which are subsequently washed ou t into the effluent [8]. 
Thus the treatment of this effluent is crucial. The discharge of the contaminated effluent without proper 
treatment can get mixed with surface and ground water and eventually affect the quality of the drinking water 
[9]. Furthermor e, dye effluent if discharged untreated affects the photosynthesis of aquatic plants by preventing 
the light to penetrate through water. The oxygen levels are affected and in extreme cases may lead to suffocation 
of aquatic flora and fauna [10]. 
Dyes are r ecalcitrant molecules difficult to degrade biologically. From the treatment point of view, the 
degradation of dyes has received considerable attention. Conventional wastewater treatment  processes  are 
suitable for stabilization of nonxenobiotic compounds whereas these processes do not work well with the 
xenobiotic compounds  [11] . Environmental policy  in m any of the countries now have made it compulsory  to 
decolorize the dye wastewater prior to release. 
Thus as an alternative  to conventional wastewater trea tment , biological processes are gaining more 
attention to remove these xenobiotic substances from the environment due to eco-friendly, efficient and low cost 
involvement.  
In this study, the decolo rization of three  triphenylmethane (TPM ) dyes namely Malachite Green  (MG), 
Crystal Violet (CV) and Basic Fuchsin (BF) were studied using bacterial consortium. Triphenylmethane dyes Microbial decolorization of Triphenylmethane dyes

cotton. Some of the triphenylmethane dyes are used as medicine  in aquaculture industry and  as biological stains. 
Paper , leathe r, food and cosmetic industries are also major consumers of triphenylmethane dye s. Although used 
extensively, most of the members of triphenylmethane are animal carcinogen  [11]. Hence there are both 
environmental as well as human health hazards associated with the bioaccumulation of these dyes in 
environment.  
In this study, t he three triphenylmethane dyes, i.e. , MG , CV and BF were treated with a bacterial 
consortium , isolated from dye contaminated wastewater from Jaggubazar,  Kolkata.  The three dyes were used 
separately as well as in a single solution to study the decolorization pattern . The decolorization w as studied with 
respect to pH,  temperature and ini tial dye concentration. UV -visible spectroscopy and Thin La yer 
Chromatography  studies of decolorized products were also carries out  in order to determine  mechanism of 
decolorization.  Finally,  the decolorized products were also checked for Chemical Oxygen Demand  in order to 
determine the level of toxicity ,as it is known that dyes increase COD and lower down the dissolved oxygen of 
water bodies which is toxic for aquatic life.   
 
II. Materials  And Methods  
2.1. Dyes used : Triphenylmethane dyes namely Malachite Green Oxalate (MG), Crystal Violet Chloride (CV) 
and Basic Fuchcsin (BF) Chloride were procured from Merck, India. These dyes were mixed together in equal 
proportions to make a stock concentration of 500 mg/L  and this was used as a stock of dye mix in our 
experiments . 
 
2.2. Isolation, acclimatization and selection of the microorganism:  Dye contaminated wastewater was 
collected from a small scale textile industry situated at Jaggu bazar, Kolkata, West Bengal and the sample was 
used for isolating potent strains which can remove the triphenylmethane dyes . 1ml of waste water was serially 
diluted upto10-7. From each of the dilution , 0.1 ml of aliquot was taken and spread with the help of sterile ‘L’ 
shaped spreader on Nutrient agar plates in duplicate. The plates were incubated at 35°C for 48 hr. After 
incubation , 20 bacterial colonies were chosen randomly depending on various colony mor phologies. After 
growing those in agar plates all the microbial isolates were examined for their capability of tolerating the dyes. 
They were transferred to mineral salt agar medium containing 10 mg/L of three different triphenylmethane dyes 
separately,  in order to determine their tolerance at such concentration. These were then grown in presence of 
mineral salt broth medium containing triphenylmethane dyes to determine the efficiency of decolorization . The 
organisms were then acclimatized to higher concent rations of dyes by growing them in presence of gradually 
increasing concentrations and incubated at 35°C for 24 to 72 hr in   mineral salt broth  medium containing dyes 
at 130 rpm. From there 6 different strains were selected for further studies  depending o n their high level of 
tolerance to TPM dyes  and were used as a bacterial consortium .   
Biomass was harvested by centrifugation of the bacterial cells at 8000 rpm for 10 min. After washing with 
normal saline the required amount of biomass was used for decol orization studies.  
2.3. Preparation of medium for growth and decolorization study  : Mineral salt medium composition for 
growth and decolorization  studies consist of (g/L): KCl - 0.5, NaNO 3 - 2, MgSO 4, 7H 20 - 0.5, FeSO 4, 7H 2O - 
0.01 and MG,CV,BF of varying  amounts (0.05 -0.5 g/L). All the constituents were weighed accordingly and 
dissolved in water. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7 ± 0.2 with either 1(N) hydrochloric acid or 1(N) 
sodium hydroxide. Then 50 ml of the medium was taken in each of 250 ml Er lenmeyer flask, plugged with 
cotton and wrapped with brown paper. The entire contents were sterilized in an autoclave at 15 lb/inch2 pressure 
for 15 min.  
2.4. Batch decolorization process : The experiments were conducted in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containi ng 
100 ml of mineral  salt medium  containing TPM dyes  separately as well as in mix solution , which was inoculated 
with 0.5 ml log phase culture of each bacterial cells in consortium  containing approximately 0.8 -0.9 ×109 
cells/ml. To evaluate the effects of various factors on the efficiency of dye decolorization , the batch dye 
decolorization  experiments were carried out at different initial dye concentrations (50 – 500 mg /L), pH (3 – 9) 
and temperatures ( 25-50 oC).  The pH of the  media were adjusted with the help of 1N HCl or 1N NaOH. The 
batch decolorization process was performed under shaking condition (130 rpm). After decolorization  of the dye 
from the media , the dye decolorization  was determined by % decolorization of the dye.  
2.5. Measurement of % decolorization  : After growing the bacterial strain s together in dye containing mineral 
salt medium for 48 hr, the broth was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min. Clear supernatant was used for 
determination of dye decolorization  in terms of % decolorization. MG, CV and BF in a single solution  and 
separately  were scanned from 300 -700 nm, where from maximum absorption (λ max) of MG,CV,BF and dye mix 
were obtained at 617, 590,540 and 585 nm respectively . The % decolorization was cal culated using the 
following expression:  
% decolorization = [(initial absorbance -observed absorbance) /initial absorbance] ×100   Microbial decolorization of Triphenylmethane dyes

visible spectroscopy  and Thin Layer Chromatography . The dye decolorization process could be brought about 
either by biosorption of the dye by the bacterial cells or by degradation of the dye molecules into smaller and 
simpler compounds. This could be confirmed by UV -visible spect roscopy. If the decolorization was because of 
biosorption, the original absorption peak would decrease proportionally but if the decolorization was due to the 
biodegradation then the main peak corresponding to the dye would be either completely lost or a n ew peak 
would appear after decolorization [13]. The above mentioned statement can be ascertained once again by 
analyses of the decolorized products by TLC. If new compounds were generated by the process of 
biodegradation their presence could be obtained by  chromatographic separation. Therefore, the decolorized 
products were analyzed by UV -Visible spectroscopy  and Thin Layer Chromatography .   
2.7. UV-visible spectroscopy:  In order to determine the whether the TPM dyes were decolorized by biosorption 
or biodegradation, the UV -visible spectrum of the dye mix and its decolorized products were scanned from 300 -
800 nm. After complete decolorization   , the decolorized medium was  centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes 
and supernatant obtained was used to extract metabolites with equal volume of ethyl acetate. The extracts were 
dried over anhydrous Na 2SO 4 and evaporated to dryness in rotary evaporator. The crystals obtained were 
dissolved in small volume of methanol and used for analysis. Degradation of TPM dyes were  further examined 
and confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC ). 
2.8. Thin Layer Chromatography:   Metabolite formation was examined by thin layer chromatography (TLC) 
using commercially available TLC plates coated with silica  gel on aluminum foil. The solvent system used was 
n-propanol: ethyl acetate: acetic acid: distilled water (6:1:1:2 v/v). The eth yl acetate extract was dissolved in 
methanol and t he visualization of separated products was done  in UV chamber.  
2.9. COD analyses of TPM dyes  and its decolorized products:   The COD of MG and its decolorized products 
were determined according to the standard titration method [ 14]. 
 
III.   Results  and Discussion  
3.1. Effect of initial dye concentration on dye decolorization:  In order to study the effect of initial 
concentration on dye decolorization , the experiments were carried out at different dye concentrations ranging 
from 10-500 mg/L for 48 hr under shaking condition. Figure  1 demonstrates the effects of initial dye 
concentration on decolorization. The best decolorization  was obtained in case of Malachite Green, followed by  
Basic Fuchsin, Crystal Violet and dye mix.   It was found that high degree of decolorization  w as obtained  at 
lower concentrations  , as the initial dye concentration increases the decolorization efficiency dropped down . 
Khehra et al. (2005) [15] suggested that the decrease in decolorization efficiency might be due to the toxic effect 
of dyes, on organisms whi ch is an important consideration for its field application. Initial concentration provides 
an important driving force to overcome all mass transfer resistance of the dye between the aqueous and solid 
phases [16] .

applications because processes are usually performed under alkaline conditions [6]. The experiment was 
performed in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml  mineral salt medium containing dyes separately and 
in a mix solution where concentration of the dye was 50 mg/L. It was observed that the dye decolorization 
varied with change in p H of the medium (Figure  2). The decolorization rate peaked around pH 8 in case of 
Malachite Green , Basic Fuchsin and dye mix. In case of Crystal Violet dye decolorization was highest at pH 6. 
It is to be noted that increased decolorization efficiency at p H 8,especially for mix dye solution, is an indication 
that the organisms can be considered as an efficient one for treating dye contaminated waste water, as most 
industrial dyes are basic in nature.  Therefore, these bacterial consortium can be considered a s an efficient one 
for the decolorization of industrial effluent.

3.3. Effect of temperature on dye decolorization : Determination of temperature requirement of 
microorganism used for biotechnological purpose is important since temperature requirement above ambient 
range may require an energy input and hence require input of cost.  The microbial consortium  can carry on 
decolorization over a broad temperature range ( 25-50ºC). The optimum temperature for the decolorization  of the 
dye was found to be in the range of 3 5-37ºC ( 88-95 % dye decolorization , Figure  3),  which  is almost the 
normal range of temperatu re in tropical country like India (except for winter). Hence this can be considered as 
an efficient, cost -effective decolorizer of dye contaminated waste water in these regions. An increase or 
reduction in temperature above the range may lead to inactivati on of the microbial enzymes by denaturation, 
which, in turn, may slow down the decolorization process.

decolorization of the TPM dyes both singly and in mixture. Results of  UV-visible scanning analyses (300 -700 
nm) of the decolorized products of dye mix revealed that the characteristic absorp tion peak of dye mix of 585  
nm was completely lost and two new absorption peaks appeared at 373 and 419  nm (Figure  4) . It was already 
established [16] that if the decolorization of dye is because of biosorption, the original absorption peak 
decreases proportionally but if the decolorization is due to the biodegradation then the main peak corresponding 
to the dye will be completely lost or a new peak wil l appear after decolorization. Therefore, the process of 
decolorization in this study indicates biodegradation of the dye s.

3.5. Results of Thin Layer Chromatography:  Thin Layer Chromatographic separation of extracted 
metabolites confirmed the degradation of TPM dyes . The RF value of TPM mix was noted as 0.0.42 where as 
extracted metabolites had shown an RF value of 0.31 . The RF value is defined as the ratio of the dist ance 
travelled by the solute and the distance travelled by the solvent along the chromatographic plate, where both 
distances were measured from a commom origin.  The changes in the movement of dye mix and their decoorized 
product s (Figure  5)  , as well as t he change in the RF value in this case definitely indicates the biotransformation 
of TPM dyes into new products,  which further confirms the process of biodegradation in this case.

3.7. COD analyses of TPM dyes and its decolorized products:  The COD values of dye  mix with different 
concentrations  TPM dyes and its  decolorized products are given in Figure  6. It was found that the treatment of 
the dye s with the microorganism decreased the COD  level of the dye s. However, in this case,  upto the 
concentration 100 mg/L was considered; the COD value of decolorized products ,here,  has already reached 280 
mg/L, which is even higher than the upper limit of COD  for disposal of effluent into surface water sources set 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8

load, which means lowering down the level of toxicity .

IV.  Conclusion  
Organisms which have a natural habitat in dye contaminated wastewater or dye contaminated lands 
have natural inherent property of withstanding harmful effects of dyes when grown in presence of them. In this 
case, we selected a small scale dying industry, c ollected dye contaminated wastewater from there and isolated 
some bacterial colonies from th at wastewater only which were capable of withstanding high concentrations of 
TPM dyes. The organisms are yet to be identified, however, their potency as efficient d ecolorizer of TPM dyes 
have already been established through this study. The bacterial consortium were capable of decolorizing the dye 
beyond 500mg/L.  The optimum pH for dye decolorization in mxed solution were found to be around pH 8.The 
optimum temperatu re was also found to be suitable for using them in tropical country like ours.  The mode of 
decolorization was also found to be biodegradation through UV -visible analysis and TLC study.  The decrease in 
the level of COD also proved the less toxic nature of t he degradation products.  Therefore, this bacterial 
consortium  can be considered as potential candidate in  treatment of real life dye house wastewater after more 
detailed studies.
