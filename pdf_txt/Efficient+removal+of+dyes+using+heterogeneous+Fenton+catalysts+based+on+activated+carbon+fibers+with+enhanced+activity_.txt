Abstract: 
This study reports on the synthesis, immobilization

and stabilization of iron (Fe) particles 
in 
activated carbon (AC) from date stem material for 
the 
heterogeneous Fenton

ardous pollutants from water. AC

Fe was synthesized through a simple and sustainable chemical 
reaction using and resu
lting in an 
environmentally friendly
 
material (AC

(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X

e
s (EDX) were used to char-
acterize the synthesized samples. XRD, FTIR and XPS results showed the successful incorporation 
of iron particles onto AC. SEM images indicated smooth surfaces with 
clearly visible 
Fe particle

. 
Compared to pure AC, AC

Fe showed hi
gher degradation 
rates 
of toluidine blue O (TBO) dye. The 
effects of
 
the
 
initial pH and TBO and H

concentrations on TBO degradation were investigated. 
The AC
-
Fe catalyst proved highly efficient in 
the 
Fenton
-
like degradation of TBO (50 ppm), with
 
the
 
re
moval of up to 99% in 3 min. This catalyst was used efficiently 
for 
up to four repeated cycles. 
The improved catalytic activity of AC
-
Fe was related to Fe particles for the generation of HO•. 
These results prove that date stems
—

—
are a suitable precursor for 
preparing 
an 
appropriate AC and catalyst and
 
for
 
eliminating dyes from 
an 
aqueous solution by a

the develop-
ment of 
functional green catal
ysts based on AC

Introduction
 
Due to the rapid growth of industrialization around the world, environmental issues 
such as 
water pollution are overwhelming problem
s
 
that 
have attracted global attention. 
The pollution 
of water by dyes is a serious problem in developed countries. While the 
manufacturing industries keep on developing, many synthetic dyes are extensively ap-
plied i
n printing, paper making
, and
 
the pharmaceutical and food industries, and they 
are very toxic and resistant to natural biodegradation [1]. In many cases, dyes such as 
nitrophenol, methylene blue, azoic colors
,
 
or toluidine blue (TBO) are found in 
wastewate
rs and can be discharged into natural surroundings because no effective treat-
ment method is available. Among these toxic dyes, TBO is a phenothiazine class of dye 
extensively used in different fields for various purposes such as medicine, the textile in-
dus
try
,
 
or biotechnology (Scheme S1) [2]. It can be used as a mediator of various chemical 
or biochemical reactions, as a fabric
-
coloring agent, and as a labeling agent to identify

organisms. The structure of TBO is given in Scheme 
S
1. Dye removal from wastew
ater is 
always a true challenge because synthetic dyes are stable compounds 
that are 
difficult to 
destroy by commonly used treatments. Despite low concentrations (less than 1 mg/L), or-
ganic dyes are highly visible, reflecting their structural complexity an
d nature. In outer 
environments, dyes are very stable. They can be preserved in water for a long time and 
are a threat to nature [3]. 
In contrast to th
ese drawbacks
,
 
traditional techniques including 
coagulation/flocculation [4], biological treatment [5]
,
 
a
nd chemical oxidation [6] are very 
difficult to apply to remove dyes during wastewater treatment.
 
Among these processes, Fenton and Fenton
-
like oxidations are considered very green 
and promising method
s
 
and have retained the attention of many researchers f
or 
wastewater treatment. Fenton
-
like oxidations consist 
of 
the use of reagents 
such as 
Fe
2+
 
or 
Fe
3+
 
and H
2
O
2
, which require very little energy as compared to other technologies [7]. Sev-
eral consecutive reactions are involved.
 
 
Fenton’s reaction is an 
oxidative reaction where hydroxyl radicals are produced by 
the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ferrous iron (
Equa-
tion
 
(
1
)
). The reaction is based on electron transfer from H
2
O
2
 
to ferrous ions [8]. The re-
generation of ferrou
s ion
s
 
in the presence of H
2
O
2
 
and hydroperoxyl radical (HO
.
) can be 
considered an advantage for Fenton
’
s reaction in terms of further degradation by ferrous 
ions. Unfortunately, Fenton
’
s reaction requires an additional step, namely the separation 
and trea
tment of the iron sludge recovered at the end of the treatment process, which 
increases the overall operational cost. In order to overcome these drawbacks, an adequate 
solution 
consists of
 
immobilizing the catalyst on inert support surfaces to avoid the ca
ta-
lyst
-
recovering step.
 
Many attempts have been made to immobilize nanoparticles on a porous solid to 
facilitate the access of H
2
O
2
 
to the active center of the catalyst and improve its dispersion 
and separability.
 
Novel approaches have investigated iron
-
co
ntaining solids 
such as 
biochar [9], cellu-
lose nanofibers [10], mesoporous silica matrix SBA [11], clays [12], zeolites [13], and mont-
morillonite [14] to prepare heterogeneous catalysts. Carbon
-
based catalysts
—
activated 
carbon [15], carbon nanotubes [16,17
] and graphene [18]
—
have recently been considered 
as interesting catalyst supports for water treatment because of their high adsorption ca-
pability, good chemical stability, and excellent heat resistance [19,20].
 
In this context, the aim of this work was th
e removal of toluidine blue (TBO) and 
the 
valorization of its residue using a green method (a Fenton
-
like reaction) with a sustainable 
catalyst immobilized on date
-
stem
-
derived AC and iron particles. Catalytic oxidation us-
ing a heterogeneous catalyst 
such 
as 
mesoporous AC was investigated. Techniques such 
as SEM, EDX, FTIR
,
 
and DRX were used to characterize the structural properties of the 
catalyst. To our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature 
that used 
iron immobi-
lized on activated carbon in 
a heterogeneous Fenton’s reaction for TBO degradation and 
date stems
—
a waste product from agriculture
—
to prepare AC. We also investigated the 
catalyst
’s
 
stability to optimize the Fenton process by evaluating the effect of each operat-
ing parameter such as catalyst dosage, initial pH, the hydrogen peroxide concentration
,
 
and the dye concentration. Additionally, the degree of mineralization of TBO was as-
sess
ed by measuring
 
the
 
total organic carbon (TOC). Finally, to demonstrate the original-
ity of the present work, our results were compared with other recently published works.

n be explained by the low amount of Fe 
in 
AC, indicating that the 
AC structure was not altered by Fe incorporation. In addition, iron impregnated 
into

was in the amorphous phase [21] (Fig

developed pores with different

during the carbonization step [22]. Fe in-
corporation was confirmed by the presence of white clusters on the AC surface. The tex-

actions of iron within the AC p

Fe was 3.3 nm, in the 
range of mesoporous carbon (1 to 4 nm) [23].

FTIR spectra can provide valuable information about the functional groups of the 
materials. The FTIR spectra of AC and AC
-
Fe are represented in 
Figure 
4.
 
Overall, the 
FTIR spectra showed similar peaks, indicating that the structure was conserved before 
and after surface modification. The band observed at 600 cm
−1
 
was attributed to the Fe
–
O 
stretching vibration, which confirmed the incorporation of iron and
/or iron oxides onto 
AC 
[24
–
26
]. The bands at 1633 cm
−1
 
were 
associated with 
the C=O functional group. More-
over, a peak at 1384 cm
−1
 
was recorded after iron incorporation due to the presence of the 
NO
3
-
 
stretching vibration. This last result can be explain
ed by the unremoved NO
3
−
 
re-
tained in the AC during the impregnation step. To confirm these results, XPS 
analyses 
were employed to evaluate the surface chemistry of the samples. The broad peaks ob-
served at 531.68, 284.66, 198.89
,
 
and 711.54 eV were associat
ed 
with 
the O 1s, C 1s, C 2p, 
and Fe 2p layers, respectively. Regarding the XPS analysis of AC, a C 1s peak centered at 
around 284.66 eV was attributed to the presence of C=C.

A slight shift toward lower eV was recorded for the O 1s peak, which appeared at
 
533.06 eV and 532.03 eV for AC and AC
-
Fe, respectively. This shift probably resulted from 
strong interactions between the Fe and O atoms. Another confirmation of Fe incorporation 
was obtained from the binding energies of Fe 2p 3/2
,
 
Fe 2p1/2
 
at 
711.54
,
 
and
 
725 eV. The 
binding energy of Fe 2 p3/2 at 711.54 eV was related to FeOOH [27] 
(Fig

5).

xidation
 
In order to evaluate the adsorption and catalytic activity of the prepared sample on 
dye removal efficiency, a series of experiments 
were 
performed by changing the initial 
AC
-
Fe concentration from 0.2 to 1.8 g/L at a constant H
2
O
2
 
concentration of 4 mmol/L
 
at 
20 °C and pH 3.5. 
The r
esults are summarized in 
Fig
ures
 
6
 
and 
7.
 
The 
oxidation 
of TBO 
by H
2
O
2 
was very low (1%). This can be explained by the negligible oxidation of H
2
O
2
 
compared to HO
.
 
[28]. In addition, the efficiency of
 
the
 
TBO removal by AC
-
Fe was
 
15% 
in the absence of H
2
O
2
 
after 3 min of reaction. However, the presence of the AC
-
Fe catalyst 
+ H
2
O
2
 
showed a very high efficiency of TBO removal (99%) in less than 3 min, due to the 
generation of HO
.
 
radicals resulting from the interaction of H
2
O
2
 
and AC
-
Fe. This trend 
was confirmed when the AC
-
Fe concentration was 1.2 g/L (
Fig
ure 
7),
 
suggesting increased 
numbers of HO
.
 
radicals due to a higher decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide [29]. 
When the catalyst concentration was increased up to 1.8 g/L
, the efficiency of TBO removal 
slightly decreased to 98%. This decreased efficiency can be explained by the coagulation 
of catalysts and the scavenging effect on HO
.
 
due to the excessive iron species present in 
the 
solution, as supported by the reaction i

The effect of different H

O
2
 
doses on TBO removal was investigated by varying the 
initial H
2
O
2 
concentration from 2 mmol/L to 8 mmol/L. As showed in 
Figure 
8
, TBO elim-
ination efficiency increased from 96
%
 
to 99% in 3 min when the H
2
O
2
 
dosage was in-
creased from 1 to 2 mmol/L. These results are attributable to the increases in 
HO
.
 
radicals 
generated by the increased H
2
O
2
 
concentration. However, 
the 
TBO removal decreased 
when the H
2
O
2
 
concentration was increased from 2 
to 
6 mmol/L, from 9
9.33% for 2 mmol/L 
to 90.30% for 6 mmol/L. This can be explained by the production of less reactive species 
such as
 
HO
2
. 
due to the scavenging effect and the auto
-
decomposition of H
2
O
2 
into O

and 
H
2
O (Eq

(

) and (

optimal H

type and degree of
 
the
 
concentration of contaminants and ferrous ions [3

].

Effect of the 
I

C
oncentration
 
The study of 
the effect of the initial TBO concentration on the efficiency of heteroge-
neous Fenton
-
like oxidation is of great interest for eliminating dyes present at different 
concentrations in industrial waste. To study this effect, the initial TBO concentration was 
made to vary from 50 to 400 mg/L, while keeping the previously optimized parameters 
constant ([H
2
O
2
] = 2 mmol/L) and ([AC
-
Fe] = 1.2 g/L). The results are presented in 
Figure 
9.
 
As the initial TBO concentration increased from 50 to 400 mg/L, the efficiency 
of 
the 
TBO degradation decreased from 99.3% to 46.3% within the same time span of 3 
min
. More 
particularly, the efficiency of
 
the
 
TBO removal was stable up to the initial concentration 
of 150 mg/L, but decreased when the concentration ranged between 200 an
d 400 mg/L. 
This can be explained by a lower number of 
HO
. 
radicals generated in the solution due to
 
the
 
competition between the large number of TBO molecules and H
2
O
2
 
molecules in 
the 
solution for adsorption on the catalyst surface [3

decreased efficiency 
in 
TBO removal.

2.3.3. 
Effect of 
I
nitial pH
 
pH is one of the 
important operational parameters that significantly affect
s
 
the re-
moval of pollutants [3
6
]. We expected the new heterogeneous Fenton catalysts to have an 
improved catalytic activity and a larger pH range compared to other catalysts. The pH of 
the solution 
regulates the rate of production of hydroxyl radicals and the amount of iron 
catalyst available at the solution/solid interface [3
7
]. The effect of
 
the
 
initial pH on TBO 
degradation was investigated within a 2.0 to 9.7 pH range 
(
Figure 
10).
 
At pH 3.5, maxi-
mum decolorization (99.3%) was obtained for AC
-
Fe in 3 min, 
linked to
 
the higher effi-
ciency of used hydrogen peroxide, hence more HO
. 
radicals available to attack the dye 
molecules in 
the 
acidic solution. This optimal pH value was similar to 
that 
used for 
treat-
ing paranitrophenol with limonite [3
8
] or when removing other pollutants by wet perox-
idation using carbon [
39
] or iron
-
impregnated carbon [4
0
] as catalysts. As expected, when 
the initial pH value increased from 3.5 to 9, the efficiency of 
the 
TBO removal relatively 
decreased because hydrogen peroxide was less stable and broke down into molecular ox-
ygen instead of being used to generate radicals
 
[4
1
]. In addition, ferrous ions can precipi-
tate under alkaline conditions to form iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)
3
) or hydrous ferric oxide 
(Fe
2
O
3
·nH
2
O) [4
2
]. These iron precipitates have a low efficiency in activating H
2
O
2
 
to pro-
duce
 
HO
•
 
radicals [4
3
]. However, p
H values below 2.0 were not suitable for TBO degrada-
tion in our AC
-
Fe/H
2
O
2 
system. In fact, H
+
 
is easily captured by H
2
O
2
 
to produce H
3
O
2
+
 
at 
a lower pH, so that the reaction between H
2
O
2
 
and Fe (II) is limited. The final pH values 
in
 
the
 
solution after th
e Fenton
-
like reaction rapidly decreased from 2.0 (initial value) to 
1.90 (final value) and from 9.7 (initial value) to 4.60 (final value). This was probably related 
to the influence of 
the 
acidic intermediates produced during the reaction. Similar results
 
for the removal of methylene blue and orange II by Fenton’s reaction have been reported 
[6] [4
4
]. (
Figure 
10
). Another possible cause of the pH change in 
the 
solution can be that 
SO
4
2
−
, NO
3
−
 
and Cl
−
 
were formed during TBO mineralization and generated acidity [4
5
]. 
The efficiency of TBO removal by AC
-
Fe was considered to be high even though the pH 
in 
the 
solution increased. Thus, the AC
-
Fe catalyst effectively removed dyes over a wide 
pH range, which 
would be a significant advantage in wastewater treatment.

We evaluated the mineralization degree of TBO to determine if the generated inter-
mediate compounds were degraded after the Fenton
-
like reaction. 
The total 
organic car-
bon (TOC) of the dye solution was measured after the optimized Fenton
-
like re
action. The 
following conditions were used to determine the mineralization degree: 
an 
initial dye con-
centration
 
of
 
50 mg/L, pH 3.5, 
4 mmol/L 
of 
H
2
O
2
, 
a 
temperature 
of 
20
 
°C, and 
1.2 g/L 
of 
AC
-
Fe. The mineralization degree reached around 64% in 3 min for 
Fe
-
AC. This result is 
a potential signal indicating higher TBO mineralization. Consequently, the heterogeneous 
Fenton reaction reduced both the color and the organic matter in the solution.
 
2.5. 
Stability and 
R
euse of the 
C
atalyst
 
Catalyst reuse is a cruci
al factor and an important point to be considered for the prac-
tical application of each catalyst material. The catalyst based on AC
-
Fe was evaluated on 
TBO degradation under normal conditions during the consecutive runs. As show
n
 
in 
Fig-
ure 
11
, the proposed
 
catalyst retained 80% of
 
the
 
TBO degradation efficiency after four 
cycles. These results confirm the good stability and reutilization of the prepared AC
-
Fe 
catalysts. A slight decrease 
in 
catalyst efficiency was observed after the fourth cycle, at-
tributab
le to the difficulty in completely removing the reaction residues and intermediates 
bound to the active site of the catalyst after the reaction. In addition, TOC measurements 
demonstrated a gradual decrease (from 64% to 52% TOC) when the number of cycles i
n-
creased (
Figure 
11
). Consequently, the AC
-
Fe catalyst can be considered as a recyclable 
and stable material for water treatment 
via
 
the Fenton
-
like reaction.

The l
eaching of solid particles during wastewater treatment is dangerous for the en-
vironment because catalysts often release metallic ion particles [4
6
]. For this reason, it was 
important to 
evaluate the iron leachability of the prepared AC
-
Fe catalyst. A leaching test 
showed that the concentration of iron ions present in the solution phase was less than 2 
mg/L. 
 
Another confirmation was obtained by ICP measurements of iron leaching from the 
r
eused solution (Table S1). The iron lixiviation test showed a small quantity of Fe leaching 
that decreased after each reaction and was lower than the environmental standard (2 
mg/L). 
 
This low amount of leached iron particles in the solution phase 
indicate
s
 
that leach-
ing was negligible and suggest
s
 
a high stability of the AC
-
Fe catalyst, mainly due to the 
suitable surface modification employed during the iron incorporation process.

Activated carbon was produced from date stems as waste biomass. It was prepared 
according to a previously reported method [4
7
]. The sample was left in 
contact
 
with the 
aqueous ZnCl
2
 
solution (activating agent/raw material 2:1, 
w

) at 70 °C for 4 h for chem-
ical activation, under magnetic stirring, and then dried at 105 °C for 24 h. Then, the waste 
biomass was pyrolyzed at 600 °C
 
in a muffle furnace for 1 h. After cooling, the sample was 
washed many times with hydrochloric acid solution (0.1 mol/L) and distilled water to 
eliminate activating agent residues and other inorganic species formed during the pro-
cess. Finally, the resulti
ng activated carbon
,
 
called AC
,
 
was dried at 105 °C overnight and 
kept in a closed container [4

]. 
 
For the functionalization step, AC powders were impregnated in metallic salt solu-
tion, following the incipient
 
wetness impregnation method [

Conclusion
s
 
This work focused on the transformation of date stem waste into a porous catalyst 
support 
via
 
a simple and green method, to be used for water treatment using a heteroge-
neous Fen
ton
-
like reaction. SEM, XPS, FTIR
,
 
and EDX analyses revealed that Fe was suc-
cessfully immobilized 
in 
AC. The prepared AC
-
Fe nanocomposite exhibited strong cata-
lytic performances for TBO degradation by a Fenton
-
like reaction using AC
-
Fe combined 
with H
2
O
2
 
a
nd resulted in up to
 
a
 
99% efficiency. The effects of various reaction parame-
ters
—

, AC

,
 
and TBO concentrations
 
and
 
initial pH
—
on 
the 
TBO degradation were 
investigated. The optimal conditions were 4 mmol/L of H
2
O
2
 
and 1.2 g/L of AC
-
Fe for 50 
mg/L of 
TBO at an initial pH of 3.5. Under these conditions, the efficiency of TBO removal 
and TOC conversion were 99% and 64%, respectively, within 3 min of reaction time for 
the first run. The catalyst exhibited
 
a
 
good recycling capacity and has potential 
for 
appli-
cation 
in 
TBO degradation. These interesting features of AC
-
Fe open promising prospects 
for obtaining a wide variety of new, 
environmentally friendly
 
catalysts for potential ap-
plications in wastewater treatment 
via
