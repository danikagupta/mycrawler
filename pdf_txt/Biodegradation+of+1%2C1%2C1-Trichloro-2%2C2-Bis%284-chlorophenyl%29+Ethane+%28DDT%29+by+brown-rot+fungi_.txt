The  development  of  an  integrated  strategy  for  the  remediation  of  soil  co-contaminated  by  heavy  metals
and persistent  organic  pollutants  is  a  major  research  priority  for  the  decontamination  of  soil  slated  for
use in agricultural production. The objective of this study was to develop a bioremediation strategy for
ﬁelds co-contaminated  with  cadmium  (Cd),  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  (DDT),  and  its  metabolites
1, 1-dichloro-2,  2-bis  (4-chlorophenyl)  ethylene  (DDE)  and  1,  1-dichloro-2,  2-bis  (4-chlorophenyl)  ethane
(DDD) (DDT,  DDE,  and  DDD  are  collectively  called  DDs)  using  an  identiﬁed  Cd-hyperaccumulator  plant
Sedum alfredii (SA) and DDT-degrading microbes (DDT-1). Initially, inoculation with DDT-1 was shown
to increase  SA  root  biomass  in  a  pot  experiment.  When  SA  was  applied  together  with  DDT-1,  the  levels  of
Cd and  DDs  in  the  co-contaminated  soil  decreased  by  32.1–40.3%  and  33.9–37.6%,  respectively,  in  a  pot
experiment over  18  months  compared  to  3.25%  and  3.76%  decreases  in  soil  Cd  and  DDs,  respectively,  in
unplanted, untreated controls. A subsequent ﬁeld study (18-month duration) in which the levels of Cd
and DDs  decreased  by  31.1%  and  53.6%,  respectively,  conﬁrmed  the  beneﬁcial  results  of  this  approach.
This study demonstrates that the integrated bioremediation strategy is effective for the remediation of
Cd-DDs co-contaminated  soils.

1.  Introduction
Heavy metals  and  persistent  organic  pollutants  (POPs)  are  often
coexisted  and recognized as two major chemical families that cause
soil  pollution  in  China  [1,2] .  Cadmium  (Cd)  and  1,1,1-trichloro-
2,2-bis  (4-chlorophenyl)  ethane  (DDT)  are  of  particular  concern
due  to  their  persistence;  potentially  carcinogenic,  mutagenic,  and
teratogenic  properties;  and  their  ubiquitous  occurrence  in  the

2,2-bis  (4-chlorophenyl)  ethylene  (DDE)  and  1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis
(4-chlorophenyl)  ethane  (DDD)  are  common  and  important  co-
contaminants  in Chinese agricultural soils [1,4] . Therefore, it is
critical  to  develop  efﬁcient  and  cost-effective  approaches  to  simul-
taneously  remove  multiple  contaminants  from  co-contaminated
soils.
The  remediation  of  soils  co-contaminated  with  metals  and
organics  is  a  complex  problem  because  the  required  chemical  pro-
cesses  and  remediation  technologies  are  different  for  each  group
of  pollutants [6]. Phytoremediation, which utilizes hyperaccumu-
lating  plants  to  extract  heavy  metals  from  contaminated  soils,  is  a

cost-effective  and  environmentally  friendly  approach  compared  to
physical  and  chemical  remediation  techniques  [7,8] .  The  feasibility
of  phytoremediation  for  soil  contaminated  by  multiple  organic  and
inorganic  contaminants  has  recently  been  investigated  [1,9–11] .
Hyperaccumulating  plants  are  valuable  for  the  phytoextraction  of
metals  in  contaminated  soils  [12] .  Sedum  alfredii  (SA)  has  recently
been  identiﬁed  as  a  Zn  and  Cd  co-hyperaccumulator  plant  species
that  is  native  to  China  [13] .  Because  of  its  favorable  characteristics,
including  fast  growth,  high  biomass,  and  asexual  reproduction  [14] ,
this  plant  species  is  ideal  for  the  phytoremediation  of  sites  polluted
by  multiple  heavy  metals  [15,16] .  The  hyperaccumulating  charac-
teristics  of  SA  have  been  studied  extensively  using  pot  experiments
and  hydroponics  [9,17–19] .  A  small  number  of  ﬁeld  evaluations
of  the  effectiveness  of  hyperaccumulators  in  remediation  of  Cd-
or  DDT-contaminated  soils  have  been  performed  [10,20–22] .  The
roots  of  SA  can  excrete  high  levels  of  dissolved  organic  matter
that  complex  and  detoxify  heavy  metals  in  the  rhizosphere;  this
excretion  of  dissolved  organic  matter  could  be  beneﬁcial  to  DDT-
degrading  microorganisms  in  the  soil  [23] .  However,  few  studies
have  reported  the  use  of  metal  hyperaccumulators  to  improve  the
removal  of  organic  and  inorganic  pollutants  from  co-contaminated
soils  [9,24] .
The  rapid  degradation  of  DDT,  DDD,  and  DDE  by  certain  bac-
teria  and  fungi  has  been  shown  to  occur  via  mineralization  or
co-metabolism  under  aerobic  and  anaerobic  conditions  [25] .  Thus,
microbial  detoxiﬁcation  is  considered  a  cost-effective,  safe  and
promising  method  for  the  removal  of  DDT  residues  from  the  envi-
ronment  [26,27] .  Microorganisms  capable  of  degrading  DDT  or  its
metabolites  DDD  and  DDE  include  Fusarium  solani  [26] ,  Alcaligenes
eutrophus  A5  [28] ,  Boletus  edulis  [29] ,  Serratia  marcescens  DT-1P
[30] ,  Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens [31] , Cladosporium sp. AJR3 18501
[32] ,  Ralstonia  eutropha  A5  [33] ,  Pseudomonas  acidovorans  M3GY
[34] ,  Terrabacter  sp.  DDE-1  [35] ,  Shewanella  decolorationis  S12  [36] ,
Sphingobacterium  sp.  D6  [37] ,  Phanerochaete  chrysosporium  [38] ,
and  twelve  species  of  brown-rot  fungi  [39] .  However,  minimal
information  is  available  on  the  removal  or  detoxiﬁcation  of  DDT,
DDD  and  DDE  from  ﬁeld  soils.
In  our  previous  studies  (unpublished  data),  a  new  bacterial
strain,  Pseudomonas sp. DDT-1, was shown to be capable of uti-
lizing  DDT as its sole carbon and energy source. However, there
is  currently  a  dearth  of  information  on  using  the  combination
of  rhizodegradation  and  phytoextraction.  To  our  knowledge,  the
plant-microbial  remediation  of  Cd-DDT  co-contaminated  soils  has
not  been  previously  reported.  Therefore,  the  objective  of  this  study
was  to  develop  novel  strategies  for  the  bioremediation  of  Cd-DDT
co-contaminated  soils using SA in conjunction with DDT-degrading
microbes.
2. Materials  and  methods
2.1. Plant  material  and  soil  characterization
Seedlings  of  the  hyperaccumulator  SA  were  originally  obtained
from  a  former  Pb/Zn  mining  area  in  Zhejiang  Province,  China,  and
grown  in  non-contaminated  soil  for  several  generations  to  min-
imize  the internal metal contents. Uniform and healthy shoots
were  selected  and  cultivated  in  a  basal  nutrient  solution  [40] .  The
soil  used  in  the  pot  experiment  (∼400  kg)  was  collected  from  the
upper  layer (0–20 cm  depth)  of  an  agricultural  ﬁeld  in  Chiqi  City,
Zhejiang  Province, China. This sampling site was co-contaminated
with heavy metals and DDs derived from industrial activities,
and the historical use of DDT in cotton production, respectively.
The  soil  was  air-dried  at  25◦C,  ground  to  pass  through  a  2  mm
sieve, and stored in a plastic bag at −80◦C  prior  to  use.  Selected
physical  and  chemical  characteristics  of  the  soil  are  shown  inTable  1

2.2.
 Inoculum  preparation
The DDT-degrading  bacterial  strain  DDT-1  was  isolated  from  a
DDT-contaminated  soil  (4.3  ±  1.2  /H9262g  g−1)  sample  collected  from  an
area  situated  near  a  pesticide  manufacturing  factory  in  Zhejiang
province,  China, as described by Fang et al. [37] . The taxonomy of
Pseudomonas  sp.  DDT-1  was  conﬁrmed  using  16S  rDNA  sequence
analysis  (GenBank  accession  number:  JN157618).  The  isolate  was
grown  in  lysogeny  broth  (LB)  medium,  maintained  in  40%  glyc-
erol,  and  stored  at  0◦C.  The  isolate  DDT-1  was  cultured  in  500  ml
Erlenmeyer  ﬂasks  containing  250  ml  of  LB  medium  at  30◦C  and
150  rpm  on  a  rotary  shaker.  During  the  exponential  phase  (24  h),
cell  pellets were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g,  10  min),
immediately  washed three times with 30 ml of phosphate buffer
(pH 7.0), and resuspended in additional phosphate buffer. Bacterial
concentrations  were determined using the most-probable-number
procedure  of  Gronewold  and  Wolpert  [43] .146 Z.-q.  Zhu  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Hazardous  Materials  235–  236 (2012) 144–  151
2.3.  Pot  experiment
Approximately 1.0  kg  of  air-dried  soil  was  placed  in  individual
pots  (15  cm  height  ×  15  cm  diameter).  The  soil  in  all  pots  received
80,  50,  and  100  mg  kg−1of  N,  P,  and  K,  respectively  (as  NH 4NO 3,
KH 2PO 4,  and  KCl).  The  main  treatments  included  two  Cd  levels:  (i)
without  Cd  spiking  (Cd  present  at  the  existing  contaminant  levels
in  the  soil),  and  (ii)  spiked  with  2.5  mg  kg−1Cd  (as  CdNO 3·4H 2O).
The  measured  total  Cd  concentrations  in  the  soils  in  treatments  (i)
and  (ii)  were  0.895  (Cd low)  and  3.225  mg  kg−1(Cd high )  soil,  respec-
tively.  The  DDs  concentration  was  0.715  mg  kg−1soil.  The  treated
soils  were  subsequently  incubated  for  30  days  at  25◦C  under  nat-
ural  light  with  ﬁve  cycles  of  saturation  with  distilled  water  every  6
days  followed  by  air-drying.  The  sub-treatments  included  the  fol-
lowing:  (i)  an  unplanted,  untreated  control  (CTRL);  (ii)  soil  planted
with  SA  (SA);  (iii)  soil  inoculated  with  the  DDT-degrading  strain
DDT-1  (M);  and  (iv)  soil  planted  with  SA  and  inoculated  with  strain
DDT-1  (SA  +  M).  For  treatments  (iii)  and  (iv),  the  inoculation  level
of  strain  DDT-1  was  approximately  1.2  ×  107colony-forming  units
(cfu)  g−1in the soil prior to SA planting. Eight uniform seedlings
of  SA  grown  for  three  weeks  in  a  basic  nutrient  solution  [40]  were
planted  per  pot  with  three  replicate  pots  per  treatment.  The  soil
moisture  content  was  maintained  at  60%  of  the  ﬁeld  holding  capac-
ity  (24.5%,  w/w)  by  adding  deionized  water  every  three  days  for
180  days.  Plants  were  grown  in  a  glasshouse  with  natural  light  and
a  day/night  temperature  cycle  of  26/20◦C  and  humidity  cycle  of
70/80%.
After six  months,  all  plants  were  uprooted,  and  soil  particles
were  manually  removed.  Roots  and  shoots  were  divided,  and  plant
materials  were  rinsed  under  tap  water  for  5  min,  washed  with
MilliQ-water  for 2 min, freeze-dried for 72 h in a Lyophlock 12
Freeze  Dry  System  (Labconco,  Kansas,  USA),  weighed,  and  crushed
to  a  ﬁne  powder  of  less  than  0.25  mm  particle  size  in  a  ball  grinder
(Retsch,  MM301,  Haan,  Germany).
Soil  samples  were  collected  from  each  pot  after  harvesting,
freeze-dried  for  48  h,  and  ground  in  an  agate  mortar  to  pass  through
a  100-mesh  nylon  sieve  for  subsequent  analysis.  All  plant  and  soil
samples  were  stored  thereafter  in  sealed  plastic  bags  at  −80◦C  until
analysis.
2.4.  Field  experiment
A  ﬁeld  experiment  was  conducted  at  the  Cd-DDs  co-
contaminated  agricultural  site  in  Chiqi  City,  China,  where  the  soil
samples  for  the  pot  experiments  were  collected.  The  treatments
(with  four replicates) included the following: (i) an unplanted,
untreated  control  (CTRL);  (ii)  planted  with  SA  (SA);  (iii)  inoculated
with  DDT-1  (M);  and  (iv)  planted  with  SA  and  inoculated  with  DDT-
1  (SA  +  M).  Each  plot  was  2.5  ×  4  m  surrounded  by  a  0.4  m  buffer
zone.  The  composite  soil  samples  for  each  plot  (0–20  cm  depth)
were  well-mixed  prior  to  Cd  and  DDs  analysis.  The  concentrations
of  Cd  and  DDs  in  the  soil  were  0.70  and  0.55  mg  kg−1soil,  respec-
tively.
One  week  before  transplanting  SA,  each  plot  received  1  kg  of
compound  fertilizer  (equivalent  to  150,  150,  and  150  kg  of  N,  P,
and  K  per  hectare,  respectively).  Soil  moisture  content  was  main-
tained  at approximately 80% (w/w) of the ﬁeld holding capacity
and  checked  gravimetrically  every  week  by  drying  sub-samples  at
105◦C  in  a  forced-air  oven  to  a  constant  weight.  Six  days  later,  a
suspension  of strain DDT-1 (6 l) with 0.5% glucose was sprayed
using a knapsack sprayer at a dose of 150 l ha−1in  the  (iii)  and
(iv)  treatment plots only, and the inoculation level of strain DDT-1
was approximately 1.0 × 106cfu  g−1in  the  upper  10  cm  of  soil.  The
remaining  plots  received  only  water.  One  day  later  (February  28th,
2008), uniform seedlings of SA were transplanted at 15 ×20 cm
spacing.  Plant  tops  were  harvested  and  weighed  at  7  months,  13months,
 and  18  months.  Soil  (0–20  cm  depth)  was  also  sampled
from  all  of  the  plots.  The  concentrations  of  Cd  and  DDs  in  plant  and
soil  samples  were  analyzed  as  described  below.
2.5. Soil  and  plant  analysis  and  quality  control
2.5.1.  Cd  analysis  and  quality  control
Sub-samples of  plant  materials  (100  mg)  were  digested  using
4  ml  of  concentrated  HNO 3and  1  ml  HClO 4at 170◦C  in  closed  Teﬂon
vessels  until  the  solution  was  clear.
A  sequential  extraction  procedure  [44]  was  used  to  determine
the  exchangeable,  carbonate-bound,  oxide-bound,  organic-bound,
and  residual  Cd  fractions  to  assess  the  fractionation  of  Cd  in  the
soil. The total soil Cd was equal to the sum of these ﬁve fractions.
Cd  concentrations  in  these  extracts  were  determined  using  ICP-MS
(Agilent  7500a,  Agilent,  USA).
Certiﬁed  reference  materials  for  soils  (GBW07409,  Center  of
Standard  Materials of China) and plants (GBW10014, Center of
Standard  Materials of China) were included in the analyses. The
recoveries  (100  ±  9%)  for  Cd  were  within  the  certiﬁed  limits  for  the
reference  materials.
2.5.2. Soil  DDs  extraction  procedure
The DDs extraction and puriﬁcation procedures were performed
according  to  USEPA  method  3550  C  (Ultrasonic  extraction)  and
3620 C (Florisil cleanup) with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, 10 g of
soil was placed in each glass vial, covered with a Teﬂon cap, sat-
urated with 50 ml of hexane/acetone (1:1 v/v) overnight, shaken
in the dark for 1 h at room temperature and 180 rpm on a rotary
shaker, and extracted for 30 min using an ultrasonic instrument
(Ishine, China). After each extraction, separation was accomplished
by centrifugation at 3000 × g  for  5  min.  The  supernatants  were  fur-
ther  prepared using a glass chromatographic column loaded from
bottom to  top  as  follows:1  cm  (height)  of  anhydrous  Na 2SO 4;  13  cm
of  Florisil suspended in n-hexane; and 1 cm of anhydrous Na 2SO 4.
The  DDs sample was eluted with 30 ml of acetone/hexane (22:125
v/v) three times and then carefully concentrated to near dryness in
a  rotary vacuum evaporator (Büchi Rotavapor, Germany) at 38◦C.
Next,  2  ml  of  chromatography-grade  hexane  was  added  to  a  rotary
steam  bottle  and  mixed  and  ﬁltered  through  a  0.22  /H9262m  organic
phase  membrane; the samples were then sealed in vials for analy-
sis.
2.5.3. Plant  DDs  extraction  procedure
DDs were extracted from the plant samples (approximately 0.5 g
of  roots  and  2  g  of  shoots)  according  to  the  same  procedure  as  for
soil  with  the  exception  of  using  50  ml  hexane/acetone  (4:1  v/v).
The  DDs  puriﬁcation  procedure  for  the  plant  samples  included
sequential  sulfonation  (USEPA  3660B)  and  Florisil  column  chro-
matography  (USEPA  3620  C)  to  remove  photosynthetic  pigments,
lipids  and other co-extractants.
2.5.4. DDs  analysis  and  quality  control
DDs  concentrations in soil or plant extracts were determined
using  GC-/H9262ECD (Agilent  7890A,  USA)  with  a  capillary  column  (J&W
123-7732,  30  m  ×  0.25  mm  ×  0.25  /H9262m,  Agilent,  USA)  and  an  auto
injector  system  according  to  USEPA  method  8081B  [42] .  The  GC
operating  conditions were as follows: injector, 250◦C;  detector,
300◦C;  initial  oven  temperature,  160◦C,  ramped  10◦C  min−1to
240◦C  and  held  for  5  min;  carrier  gas:  ultrahigh-purity  nitrogen,
ﬂow  4.85 ml min−1.  DDs  were  identiﬁed  by  comparing  the  reten-
tion  times to those of the standards and were quantiﬁed using peak
area  integration.  Standard  samples  of  p,p/prime-DDT,  o,p/prime-DDT,  p,p/prime-DDD
and  p,p/prime-DDE  (purity  >99.5%)  were  purchased  from  Dr.  Ehrenstor-
fer  (Augsburg,  Germany).  External  standards  of  DDT,  DDD  and  DDEZ.-q.  Zhu  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Hazardous  Materials  235–  236 (2012) 144–  151 147
were  prepared  in  hexane  and  analyzed  to  obtain  a  standard  lin-
ear  regression.  The  recovery  of  spiked  DDs  was  96.2%  (±4.5)  in  soil
samples  and  94.9%  (±4.2)  in  plant  samples.
2.5.5. Data  analysis
The translocation  factor  (TF)  is  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  the  pol-
lutant  concentration  in  the  shoots  to  the  concentration  in  the
roots.  The  bioaccumulation  factor  (BAF)  is  the  ratio  of  the  pollu-
tant  concentration  in  the  plant  to  the  concentration  in  soil.  The
phytoextraction  ratio  (PR)  is  the  total  amount  of  pollutant  in  the
plant  versus  that  in  the  soil.  Total  pollutant  accumulation  per  plant
organ  was  calculated  by  multiplying  the  tissue  concentration  of
pollutant  with  the  root  or  shoot  dry  weight.  The  removal  efﬁciency
(RE)  is  the  percent  change  in  concentration  of  the  pollutant  in  the
soil  after and before treatment [45,46] .
The signiﬁcance of the treatments was evaluated using the SPSS
v.13.0  software  package  (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA).  A  one-way
analysis of  variance  (ANOVA)  followed  by  a  Tukey’s  multiple  com-
parison  test (at P <0.05) was employed.
3.  Results  and  discussion
3.1. Pot  experiment
3.1.1.  Growth  of  S.  alfredii
Soil inoculation  using  DDT-1  increased  the  SA  root  biomass  but
had no signiﬁcant effect on the shoot biomass at both Cd lev-
els  (Fig.  1).  The  stimulation  of  SA  root  growth  by  strain  DDT-1
could  be  due  to  inoculation-induced  variations  in  the  rhizobacterial
community  structure  within  the  soil  [47] .  The  shoot  biomass  was
signiﬁcantly (P <0.05) greater (32.9%) in the Cd high soil  than  in  the
Cd low soil  regardless  of  DDT-1  inoculation.  This  enhanced  growth  in
high-Cd  soil  is  similar  to  previously  reported  results  showing  that
SA  thrived  in  Cd-contaminated  soils  [13,48] .  The  results  from  this
study indicate that SA can adapt easily to Cd in soils, and it is prac-
tical  and  feasible  to  remediate  Cd-contaminated  soil  by  planting
SA.
3.1.2.  Cd and DDs concentrations in S. alfredii
Cadmium concentrations  in  roots,  stems,  and  leaves  were
greater  in  the  Cd high treatment  than  in  the  Cd low treatment  (Fig.  2).
The  inoculation  of  the  soil  with  DDT-1  had  no  signiﬁcant  effect
on  the  Cd  concentrations  in  the  roots,  stems,  and  leaves  of  SA  at
both  soil Cd levels as compared to those without DDT-1 inocula-
tion.  (Fig. 2). DDT-1 inoculation corresponded to a decrease in the
DDs  concentrations  in  SA  with  the  exceptions  of  p,p/prime-DDT,  p,p/prime-DDE
and  p,p/prime-DDD  in  the  roots  and  p,p/prime-DDD  in  the  stems  (Fig.  3  and
supplementary  material Fig. S1).
The  DDs  amounts  in  roots  and  shoots  (stems  and  leaves)  of
SA  grown  in  potted  soil  without  DDT-1  inoculation  were  4.6  and
43.1  /H9262g, respectively.  The  DDs  values  for  roots  and  shoots  of  plants
grown in soil with DDT-1 inoculation were 6.5 and 24.7 /H9262g, respec-
tively.  The  incorporation  of  strain  DDT-1  into  the  soil  increased
the total amount of DDs in the roots while decreased the DDs
levels  in  the  shoots.  This  result  is  in  agreement  with  other  study
in which Glomus etunicatum respectively increased and decreased
the  levels  of  DDs  accumulation  in  alfalfa  roots  and  shoots  [49] .
This  is  mainly  due  to  DDT-1  inoculation  enhancing  the  removal
of  DDs  from  soil,  and  increasing  SA  root  biomass  that  could,  in  turn,
enhance  the  sequestration,  adsorption,  and  relative  bioaccessibil-
ity of DDs in roots, thus reducing the translocation of DDs from root
to  shoot  [49] .  However,  elucidation  of  any  direct  effect  needs  to  be
addressed  by  further  work.3.1.3.
 Translocation  factors  (TF),  bioaccumulation  factors  (BAF)
and  phytoextraction  ratio  (PR)  for  Cd  and  DDs
DDT-1 inoculation had no signiﬁcant effect on the TF, BAF, or
PR  of  Cd  in  SA  (Table  2).  The  mean  values  of  TF,  BAF  and  PR  of  Cd
were  2.08,  54.6  and  0.39,  respectively,  in  the  low-Cd  soil,  and  1.65,
28.2  and  0.25  in  the  Cd-spiked  soil.  Previous  studies  have  reported
similar results  showing  that  the  TF  of  SA  for  Cd  varied  from  3.36
to  4.43  and  the  BAF  of  SA  for  Cd  ranged  from  7.35  to  38  [50,51] .
These  observations  are  consistent  with  the  characteristics  of  Cd
hyperaccumulators  [7].
Soil  inoculation  with  DDT-1  decreased  the  values  of  TF,  BAF,  PR
of  SA  for  DDs  (Table  2).  The  TF,  BAF,  PR  values  of  SA  decreased  by
0.15-  to  1.2-fold  with  the  treatment.  Lower  TF,  BAF,  PR  values  for
DDs  were  observed  in  the  treatments  of  inoculation  with  DDT-1
because  DDT-1  inoculation  increased  the  overall  amount  of  DDs
removed  from  the  soil  and  decreased  the  extent  of  DDs  accumula-
tion in the shoots. For SA plants with or without DDT-1 inoculation,
the  TF  values  were  >15  for  o,p/prime-DDT  and  >1.0  for  p,p/prime-DDD  but  were
<1.0  for  p,p/prime-DDT  and  p,p/prime-DDE.  The  TF  value  was  <0.1  for  p,p/prime-DDE,
which  is  much  lower  than  the  corresponding  values  (0.4–1.2)  for
Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo [46,52] . This result implies that p,p/prime-DDE
absorbed  by  SA  plants  was  retained  in  the  roots  with  only  a  small
portion  translocated  to  the  shoots.  The  BAF  values  were  <5.0  for
p,p/prime-DDT,  p,p/prime-DDD,  and  p,p/prime-DDE,  which  are  lower  than  those  pre-
viously  observed  in  pumpkin  (>8)  and  zucchini  (>20)  for  p,p/prime-DDE
[53] .  However,  higher  BAF  values  (>29)  were  observed  for  o,p/prime-DDT,
which  suggests  that  SA  plants  may  be  particularly  well  adapted
to  accumulate  o,p/prime-DDT.  The  shoot  PR  values  for  o,p/prime-DDT  were
0.21–0.51  and  varied  from  0.004  to  0.04  for  p,p/prime-DDE,  p,p/prime-DDD,
and  p,p/prime-DDT  (Table  2).  These  results  are  indicative  of  relatively  low
levels  of DDs phytoextraction by SA, with the exception of o,p/prime-DDT.
3.1.4.  The  removal  of  Cd  and  DDs  from  the  soil
3.1.4.1. Cd removal from the soil. Planting SA alone corresponded to
Cd removal  percentages  of  32  and  39%  for  the  low-Cd  and  spiked  Cd
levels,  respectively  (Fig.  4).  The  presence  of  DDT-1  microbes  alone
had  no  effect  on  Cd  removal.  Planting  SA  (with  or  without  DDT-1
microbes)  decreased  the  concentrations  of  all  forms  of  Cd  in  the
soil  relative to those in soil without plants (Table 3). The exchange-
able,  carbonate-bound, oxide-bound, organic-bound, and residual
Cd  fractions  were  reduced  by  25.5–39.1%,  35.2–40.4%,  10.3–33.4%,
24.4–36.4%,  and  21.1–28.4%,  respectively  in  the  low  and  high  Cd
soils.  This  result  suggests  that  SA  plants  can  efﬁciently  take  up
Cd  from  the  resistant  (i.e.,  oxide-bound,  organic-bound,  and  resid-
ual)  fractions,  as  well  as  the  bioavailable  (i.e.,  exchangeable  and
carbonate-bound)  fractions. This uptake capability equaled that of
the  pot-grown  hyperaccumulator  T.  caerulescens  [54] .  Our  results
conﬁrm  the  previous  ﬁnding  that  hyperaccumulating  plants  may
be  able  to  mobilize  insoluble  Cd  in  the  soil  [55,56] .
3.1.4.2. The  removal  of  DDs  from  the  soil.  SA  with  DDT-1  inocula-
tion  decreased the concentrations of p,p/prime-DDE,  o,p/prime-DDT, p,p/prime-DDD,
p,p/prime-DDT  and  DDs  in  the  soil  by  27.5,  39.4,  51.9,  34.0  and  33.3%,
respectively,  relative to uninoculated soil (Table 4 and Fig. 4). Fur-
thermore, in  the  SA  +  M  treatment,  it  was  estimated  that  there  was
256  /H9262g  of  DDs  dissipation  in  the  soil,  including  a  larger  amount  of
DDs  (198 /H9262g) degradation  in  the  soil,  and  a  much  smaller  amount
of  DDs  (31.2  /H9262g)  accumulation  in  the  SA  plant,  with  only  6.5  /H9262g
and  24.7  /H9262g  DDs  in  the  roots  and  shoots,  respectively.  In  our  study,
Pseudomonas  sp. DDT-1 capable of utilizing DDs as its sole source of
carbon and energy was isolated and puriﬁed (data not presented).
The results show that the incorporation of strain DDT-1 into the
soil enhances the degradation of DDs, thereby indicating that strain
DDT-1  has  the  potential  to  signiﬁcantly  reduce  DDs  concentrations
in a cost-effective manner and is a promising candidate for the
bioremediation  of  soils  contaminated  by  DDs.  A  similar  study  by148 Z.-q.  Zhu  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Hazardous  Materials  235–  236 (2012) 144–  151

Mitra  et  al.  [26]  reported  that  genetically  improved  recombinants
of  the  soil  fungus  Fusarium  solani  exhibit  superior  DDT  degradation
characteristics.
3.2. Field  experiment
Inoculation using the DDT-1 strain had no signiﬁcant effect on
the shoot  biomass  yields  (Table  5).  In  all  control  soils,  Cd  and  DDs
concentrations  did  not  signiﬁcantly  change  (∼3.4% for Cd and ∼2.1%
for  DDs) over the course of the experiment. Soil inoculation of SA
with DDT-1  decreased  the  concentrations  of  Cd  and  DDs  from  0.695
to  0.479 mg kg−1(31.1%)  and  from  0.549  to  0.255  mg  kg−1(53.6%),
respectively,  over  the  18-month  period  (Fig.  5  and  supplementary
material  Fig.  S2).  The  inoculation  of  the  soil  with  the  DDT-1  strain
had  no signiﬁcant effect on Cd removal from soil by SA. The mean
Cd  contents in the roots and shoots of SA were 5.5 and 110 g ha−1
per  cropping  season,  respectively  (data  not  presented).  Phytoex-
traction  of  Cd  in  this  study  was  lower  than  that  by  T.  caerulescens
(540  g Cd ha−1,  over  three  years)  in  a  ﬁeld  trial  by  Hammer  and
Keller  [57] .  Phytoextraction  of  Cd  from  soil  is  dependent  on  soil
types,  sources  of  contamination,  and  other  environmental  factors
[21] .
Inoculation with DDT-1 decreased the concentrations of all DDT
isomers  in  SA  shoots,  with  the  exception  of  p,p/prime-DDE,  relative  to  con-
trols  without  DDT-1  (Table  5).  The  net  uptake  of  DDs  by  SA  shoots
and  roots were 5.45 and 0.79 g ha−1,  respectively  (data  not  shown).
4. Conclusions
This study  demonstrated  that  the  planting  of  SA  is  an  effective
technique  for  phytoextraction  of  Cd  from  co-contaminated  soils.
The  inoculation of strain DDT-1 to potted soils could increase the
root  biomass  of  SA  and  enhance  the  rhizodegradation  of  DDs  in  the
soil.  The  results  of  this  study  indicate  that  the  application  of  SA
together  with strain DDT-1 appears to be a promising approach for
the  bioremediation of soils co-contaminated by Cd and DDs. How-
ever,  further  studies  on  the  survival,  colonization,  and  population
levels  of  strain  DDT-1  in  soil  are  required  to  develop  more  effective
bioremediation  strategies.
