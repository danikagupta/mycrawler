Empirical Bayes Analysis of a Microarray Experiment

Microarrays are a novel technology that facilitates the simultaneous measurement of thousands of gene expression levels. A typi- 
cal microarray experiment can produce millions of data points, raising serious problems of data reduction, and simultaneous infer- 
ence. We consider one such experiment in which oligonucleotide arrays were employed to assess the genetic effects of ionizing 
radiation on seven thousand human genes. A simple nonparametric empirical Bayes model is introduced, which is used to guide 
the ef/bullet5 cient reduction of the data to a single summary statistic per gene, and also to make simultaneous inferences concern- 
ing which genes were affected by the radiation. Although our focus is on one speci/bullet5 c experiment, the proposed methods can be 
applied quite generally. The empirical Bayes inferences are closely related to the frequentist false discovery rate (FDR) criterion. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Through the use of DNA microarrays, a novel technology, 
it is now possible to obtain quantitative measurements for the 
expression of thousands of genes present in a biological sam- 
ple. DNA microarrays have been used to monitor changes in 
gene expression during important biological processes (e.g., 
cellular replication and the response to changes in the environ- 
ment), and to study variation in gene expression across col- 
lections of related samples (e.g., tumor samples from patients 
with cancer). A major statistical task is to understand the struc- 
ture of the data from such studies, which often consist of mea- 
surements on thousands of genes in dozens of conditions. 
This article concerns the use of microarrays in a compara- 
tive experiment, where it is desired to compare gene expres- 
sion under Treatment versus Control conditions. We wish to 
identify which of several thousand candidate genes have had 
their expression levels changed, either positively or negatively, 
by the Treatment. Answering this question requires an ef/bullet5 cient 
data reduction strategy, because microarrays deliver megabytes 
of information, and also statistical inference techniques that 
deal with the dif/bullet5 culties of simultaneous inference on thou- 
sands of genes. We discuss both problems here, working in 
the context of an experiment on radiation sensitivity discussed 
later.
The statistics literature for microarrays, still in its infancy 
and with much of it unpublished, has tended to focus on 
frequentist data-analytic devices such as cluster analysis, 
bootstrapping, and linear models (see Li and Wong 2000; 
Kerr and Churchill 2000; Black and Doerge 2000; Van del 
Laan and Bryan 2000; Eisen, Spellman, Brown, and Botslein 
1998). Parametric Bayesian modeling was featured in Newton, 
Kendziorski, Richmond, Blatter, and Tsui (2000) and to a 
less extent in Lee, Kuo, Whitmore, and Sklar (2000). Multi- 
ple comparison techniques, designed to control error rates in 
thousands of simultaneous hypotheses tests, were explored in 
Dudoit, Yang, Callow , and Speed (2000). Tusher, Tibshirani,

thank the Editor and Associate Editor for suggestions that improved the 
manuscript. and Chu (2001) approached the simultaneity problem through 
the method of false discovery rates (FDRs), as discussed later. 
Our inferences here will be based on a simple nonpara- 
metric empirical Bayes model. The model produces useful a
posteriori probabilities of effect for the individual genes, with 
a minimum of prior assumptions. It also connects well with 
Benjamini and Hochberg’ s (1995) frequentist theory of FDRs, 
as discussed in Section 5. Besides being useful in its own 
right, the empirical Bayes model helps to select from among 
competing data reduction schemes, a crucial point in dealing 
with the massive datasets microarrays produce. 
Here is some background on microarrays in general and the 
speci/bullet5 c experiment analyzed in this article. Virtually all liv- 
ing cells contain chromosomes, large pieces of DNA contain- 
ing hundreds or thousands of genes, each of which speci/bullet5 es 
the composition and structure of a protein (or sometimes sev- 
eral related proteins). Protein polymers of amino acids are 
the workhorse molecules of the cell, responsible, for exam- 
ple, for cellular structure, producing energy and important 
biomolecules like DNA and proteins, and for reproducing 
the cell chromosomes. Every cell in an organism has nearly 
the same set of chromosomes, and thus contains the same 
repertoire of proteins. However, cells have remarkably distinct 
properties, such as the differences between human eye cells, 
hair cells and liver cells, distinctions that are the result of dif- 
ferences in the abundance, distribution, and state of the cell 
proteins. One of the seminal discoveries of molecular biology 
was that these changes in protein abundance are determined 
in part by changes in the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA), 
small and relatively unstable nucleic acid polymers that shut- 
tle information from chromosomes to the cellular machines 
that synthesize new proteins. Thus, there is a logical connec- 
tion between the state of a cell and the details of its protein 
and mRNA composition. 
Whereas it remains dif/bullet5 cult to measure the abundances of a 
cell’ s proteins, the recently developed DNA microarray makes 
it possible to quickly and ef/bullet5 ciently measure the relative rep- 
resentation of each mRNA species in the total cellular mRNA 
population, or in more familiar terms to measure gene expres- 
sion levels. 
There are two major kinds of microarrays. I n an oligonu- 
cleotide array, the kind featured in this article, there are 20 
probe pairs (pm, mm) for each gene. The perfect match (pm)

probe is designed to match a small subsequence of the gene 
about 25 bases long. The mismatch (mm) probe is a control, 
being identical to pm except with the middle base /bullet6 ipped to 
its complement. An experimental sample is hybridized on the 
microarray, and the RNA expression of the gene is estimated 
by the difference in signal pm– mm averaged over the 20 probe 
pairs. There is some concern that subtracting mismatch num- 
bers may actually degrade the inferences, a question we con- 
sider in this article. 
In a spotted cDNA microarray, the other major variety, one 
base sequence matching all or part of a gene is printed on a 
glass slide. The experimental sample is labeled with red dye 
and hybridized on the slide. As a control, a reference sample 
is labeled with green dye and hybridized on the same slide. 
Using a /bullet6 uorescent microscope, the log (red– green) intensi- 
ties of RNA hybridization at each site are measured. The red–
green microarray is featured in much of the recent literature, 
see Newton et al. (2001), Dudoit et al. (2000), and Lee et al. 
(2001). Our discussion, like that in Li and Wong (2000) cen- 
ters in the Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray, but similar 
analysis problems arise for both types of array. However, our 
Empirical Bayes procedure, summarized in Algorithm 1, can 
be applied quite generally. An example extending the empiri- 
cal Bayes analysis to a cDNA microarray experiment appears 
in Remark D of Section 6, showing how our methods can be 
applied to other experimental situations. 
From either type of microarray, we obtain several thou- 
sand expression values, one or many for each gene. Microar- 
rays in current use measure anywhere from 1,000 to 25,000 
genes; larger ones will soon be available. I n a typical study, a 
number of experimental samples are each hybridized to a dif- 
ferent microarray to learn about gene expression differences 
across different conditions. For example Alizadeh et al. (2000) 
studied gene expression patterns from tissue samples from a 
number of lymphoma patients and related gene expression to 
patient survival. Clustering methods (Eisen et al. 1998) were 
the main tool used in that article, and in a number of other 
similar studies. Here we will be interested in the more famil- 
iar statistical task of comparing Treatment and Control arrays, 
though carried out in a novel setting. 
Our particular dataset comes from a set of eight oligonu- 
cleotide microarrays in an experiment designed by Professor 
Gilbert Chu of the Stanford Biochemistry Department to study 
transcriptional responses to ionizing radiation. Some cancer 
patents have severe life-threatening reactions to radiation treat- 
ment. It is important to understand the genetic basis of this 
sensitivity, so that such patients can be identi/bullet5 ed before the 
treatment is given. The eight microarrays were labeled 
4U1A1U1B1I1A1I1B1U2A1U2B1I2A1I2B51 (1.1)
the labels indicating the following experimental design: RNA 
was harvested from two wild-type human lymphoblastoid cell 
lines, designated “ 1” and “ 2,” growing in an unirradiated 
state “ U,” or in an irradiated state “ I.” RNA samples were 
labeled and divided into two identical aliquots for independent 
hybridizations, “ A” and “ B.” Each microarray provided expres- 
sion estimates for 6,810 genes. Further experimental details 
appear in Remark A of Section 6. Here is the article’ s plan: the data structure of the radiation 
experiment is described in Section 2. This sets up the main 
thrust of the article, the ef/bullet5 cient reduction of microarray data 
(320 numbers per gene in this case) to a single summary statis- 
tic“Zi” for each gene, followed by an appropriate simultane- 
ous inference for the activity of each gene based on all the Z
scores. Section 3 presents the simple nonparametric empirical 
Bayes model used to make our simultaneous inferences. The 
model is presented in algorithmic form, suggesting how it can 
be applied to other microarray comparative experiments, both 
oligoneucliotide and cDNA types. (Another such experiment 
is brie/bullet6 y discussed in Section 6.) 
Section 4 concerns the ef/bullet5 cient reduction of the data to 
a single score Ziper gene. The reduction makes use of the 
empirical Bayes model, essentially selecting mappings that 
maximize the amount of Bayesian information preserved in 
Zi. Frequentist justi/bullet5 cation of the empirical Bayes approach 
appears in Section 5, where it is related to Benjamini and 
Hochberg’ s (1995) theory of FDR. Section 6 closes with a 
summary and some detailed remarks, including a comparison 
of our analysis with a “ gold standard” assay of some of the 
genes.
2.THE DATA
Microarray experiments produce enormous amounts of data, 
more than two million feature numbers in the relatively small 
experiment we are discussing here. The statistical task is to 
ef/bullet5 ciently reduce these numbers to simple summaries of the 
genes’ activities. One goal in this article is to provide a method 
for comparing the statistical ef/bullet5 ciency of different data reduc- 
tion strategies. 
Here is a description of the data in the radiation experiment, 
and the notation we will use to describe it. Expression levels 
were recorded for 6,810 different genes, 
genes: iD1121:::1nD618100 (2.1)
(There were actually 7,129 genes, 319 of which had some 
missing data. For convenience, this article considers only 
the 6,810 genes having complete data. The various analyses 
were also carried out on all 7,129 genes, with nearly identi- 
cal results.) Each gene on each plate was represented by 20 
oligonucleotide “ probes, ”
probes: jD1121:::1JD200 (2.2)
Finally there were eight plates, (the individual microarrays) 
representing the eight experimental conditions of the exper- 
iment described in section 1, (U1A, U1B, I1A, I1B, U2A, 
U2B, I2A, I2B), 
plates: kD1121:::1KD80 (2.3)
Two features were recorded for each probe of each gene on 
each plate, a “ perfect match number” pm ijkand a “ mismatch 
number” mmijk, the latter referring to a deliberately distorted 
version of the oligonucleotide included as a control. Table 1 
shows the 20 pairs of numbers for gene iD21715onplate
kD1.
We will investigate three separate stages of data reduction: 
“ probe reduction” , the mapping that takes the 20 probe pair Efron et al.: Bayes Analysis of Microarray 1153

of a statistical inference concerning iactivity of gene. The 
nonparametric empirical Bayes analysis of Section 3 will pro- 
vide inferences of the form Prob 8Eventi—Zi9, where Event iis
an event of interest such as “ gene i’ s activity was affected by 
radiation.” Section 5 connects these probabilities with the fre- 
quentist FDR criteria of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). 
There are of course an unlimited selection of possible data 
reductions from the original data, 320 numbers per gene in the 
radiation experiment, to the expression scores Zi. For reasons 
explained in Section 4, the empirical Bayes analysis will lead 
us to prefer the following choices: For the probe reduction let 
MikDmean 8log4pmijk5ƒ05¢log4mmijk51jD1121:::12090
(2.6)
For the gene reduction, /bullet5 rst compute the four differences 
4Di11Di21Di31Di45between the irradiated and unirradiated 
values within the same wild-type sample and aliquot, for 
example
Di1DMi3ƒMi11 (2.7)
the difference between the I1A and U1A values Mik.Then
take
ZiDSDi=4a0CSi51 (2.8)
whereSDiis the average of the four differences, Siistheir
sample standard deviation, and a0is the 90th percentile of the 
6,810 Svalues. Speci/bullet5 cations (2.6)– (2.8) will be used as a 
comparison point in all of our numerical examples. They will 
be compared with other choices in Section 4, including the 
current one included in the Affymetrix software. 
3. EMPIRICAL BAYES INFERENCES 
Besides analyzing the radiation data, our goal here is to pro- 
vide data analytic techniques useful in a variety of microarray 
situations. With generality in mind we will avoid highly spec- 
i/bullet5 ed models, relying instead on a simple inference model that is likely to apply to most comparative experiments: that a gene 
is either affected on unaffected by the treatment of interest, 
radiation in our case, giving two possible distributions for the 
expression score “Z,” (2.5). Lee et al. (2000) used a normal 
theory version of this idea, as, less directly, did Li and Wong 
(2000). Newton et al. (2000) focused on Gamma models. Here 
we will avoid parametric assumptions. The resulting nonpara- 
metric empirical Bayes analysis, which provides a posteriori 
probabilities of effect for the various genes, is further justi/bullet5 ed 
in Sections 4– 6. 
Let
p1Dprobability that a gene is affected 1
p0D1ƒp1Dprobability unaffected 1 (3.1)
and
f14z5Dthe density of Zfor affected genes 
f04z5Dthe density of Zfor unaffected genes 0(3.2)
Then
f4z5Dp0f04z5Cp1f14z5 (3.3)
is the mixture density of the two populations. In our situation, 
we can estimate f4z5directly from the 6,810 expression scores 
Ziobtained from the data reduction (2.4) and (2.5). 
In the absence of strong parametric assumptions such as 
normality, model (3.3) is useless without an estimate of the 
“ null density” f04z5. Fortunately, it is easy to obtain such esti- 
mates. What follows is the method we used to estimate f04z5
in the radiation experiment. Section 6 discusses variants of 
this method that are applicable more generally. 
The 61810/bullet28matrix Mof expression values (2.4), one 
value for each gene on each plate, gives a 6 1810/bullet24matrix D
of differences between the irradiated and unirradiated expres- 
sion values, as in (2.7). Let Mkindicate the kthcolumn ofM,
a 6,810 vector. With the plates ordered as before, (U1A, U1B, 
I1A, I1B, U2A, U2B, I2A, I2B), the “ difference matrix” Dis

obtained via

Now let the “ null difference matrix” dbethe61810/bullet24
matrix obtained by differencing within the aliquot splits, 
dD4M2ƒM11M4ƒM31M6ƒM51M8ƒM751 (3.6)
so for example the /bullet5 rst column of drecords differences 
between the B and A splits of the unirradiated wild-type 1 
experiments. We de/bullet5 ne “ null scores” zD4z11z21:::1z6181050
by
[original data] !M!d!z1 (3.7)
with the understanding that except for the substitution of dfor
D, the arrows in (3.7) indicate the same mappings as in (3.5). 
We will use the empirical distribution of the null scores 8zi9
to estimate the null density f04z5in (3.3). One could just as 
well takeM1ƒM2asM2ƒM1in (3.6), etc., and in fact our 
numerical algorithm employs random sign permutations of the 
columns ofdto improve the estimation of f0. The basic idea 
here, that we can recover the “ null hypothesis” from differ- 
ences that negate treatment effects, shows up in one form or 
another in many of the microarray references, being essentially 
unavoidable in a comparative experiment. Further discussion 
appears in Section 6, which describes strategies that might be 
used for estimating f0in situations less intricate than the radi- 
ation experiment. 
An application of Bayes’ rule to the mixture model (3.3) 
gives the a posteriori probabilities p14Z5andp04Z5thatagene
with score Zwas affected or unaffected by the treatment: 
Bayes’ Rule: p14Z5D1ƒp0f04Z5=f 4Z5
and
p04Z5Dp0f04Z5=f 4Z50 (3.8)
The ratio f04Z5=f 4Z5 can be estimated directly from the 
8Zi9and 8zi9empirical distributions. The probabilities p0
andp1D1ƒp0are unidenti/bullet5 able without strong parametric 
assumptions, but this will turn out to be less problematic than 
it might seem. The constraint that p14Z5be nonnegative for

technical details that appear in Section 6): 
Algorithm 1: Empirical Bayes analysis for microarrays 
(a) Compute the scores 8Zi9according to (3.5), using probe 
reduction (2.6) and gene reduction (2.8). 
(b) Compute the null scores 8zi9in the same way, beginning 
with (3.7). Generate 20 versions of the 8zi9,based on
20 independent row-wise sign permutations of d(see
Remark D).
(c) Use logistic regression to estimate the ratio f04z5=f 4z5
based on the relative densities of the 8Zi9tothe8zi9
(see Remark C). 
(d) Use relationship (3.9) to obtain an estimated upper 
bound forp0:here p0D0811 (See Remark F.) 
(e) For each gene compute Prob 8Event —Z9from (3.8), with 
f0=festimated from the logistic regression, and p0
equaling its estimated maximum value (or more conser- 
vatively with p0D1.)
We have focussed on our particular experimental setup, but 
Algorithm 1 is quite general. It can be applied to any two- 
class situation, for example two sets of unpaired samples. All 
that changes is the generation of null scores ziinstep (b).
For instance, for unpaired samples the values of ziwould be
generated by random permutations of the column labels “ 1”
and “ 2.” Remark E of Section 6 gives another example. 
Our Bayesian analysis is actually “ empirical Bayes” in the 
sense that the crucial ratio f04Z5=f 4Z5in (3.8) is estimated Efron et al.: Bayes Analysis of Microarray 1155
from the data rather than from apriori assumptions. Newton 
et al. (2000) carried out a similar analysis, but using speci/bullet5 c 
Bayesian modeling assumptions beyond (3.1)– (3.3). 
In Figure 1, the a posteriori probability of being affected 
is seen to increase as ZorƒZgrows large. The positive end 
oftheZ-axis corresponds to genes turned onby the radiation, 
with their expression values increased, while negative values 
ofZindicate decreased expression under radiation. Out of the 
6,810 genes 127 genes had p14Z5exceeding .90, more on the 
negative than positive end of the Zscales.
Eighteen of the 6,810 genes were independently assessed 
by a Northern Blot analysis, a pre microarray assay that serves 
here as a gold standard for gene expression. Seven of these, 
indicated by “C” in Figure 1, were deemed “ affected posi- 
tively by radiation, ” /bullet5 ve indicated by “ƒ” were “ affected neg- 
atively,” and six indicated by “ o” were “ not affected. ” There is 
good agreement between the Northern Blot assessments and 
the probabilities assigned in Figure 1. The full results, given 
in Section 6, show a high correlation between the gold stan- 
dard and our results. 
In comparing different data reductions, it is convenient to 
always have the same marginal distribution for Z.Tothis
end, the raw scores 8Zi9from (2.8) were monotonically trans- 
formed to have a nearly perfect N40115distribution, say by 
transformation m4Z5 , and then the null scores were trans- 
formed according to the same m4z5 . Notice that the crucial 
ratio f04z5=f 4z5remains the same under such transformations, 
sothatp14Z5andpo4Z5in (3.8) are transformation invariant. 
We will always make the empirical distribution of the 8Zi9
almost perfectly N40115, using a normal scores transforma- 
tion, implying for example that 42 D61810 ¢41ƒê420555of
the 6,810 genes have Zi>205,with êthe standard normal 
cumulative distribution function. 
Figure 2 shows the estimates of f01f11andfcontributing to 
Figure 1;f4Z5is a standard N40115density, by construction, 
while f04z5is a less dispersed density. This is what we hoped 
for of course: the values of Zshould be more dispersed than 
the values of zbecause they re/bullet6 ect the disturbing effects of the 
radiation treatment. The large values of Prob 8Event —Z9inthe
tails of Figure 1 come from (3.8), and the small ratio of f04z5
tof4Z5. A good choice of data reductions makes f04z5=f 4z5
small for—z—large, and we will use this criterion to guide our 
choices of the probe and gene reductions in Section 4. 
Looking again at (3.8),

The dotted curve in Figure 1 is 1 ƒf04Z5=f 4Z5.This isnot
much less than the solid curve for large values of —Z—,giving
106 genes with p14Z5¶090.
4. EFFICIENT DATA REDUCTIONS FOR 
MICROARRAY EXPERIMENTS 
The empirical Bayes analysis of Section 3 depends on a 
drastic data reduction: from the full vector viof data for gene 
i, a 320-vector in the radiation experiment, to a single number 
Zi(and its null counterpart zi.) I nformation is bound to be 
lost in the mapping from vitoZi, but the less we lose the 
more powerful will be the analysis, and better our chance of 
detecting genuinely affected genes. 
To state things more exactly, we can imagine applying 
model (3.1)– (3.2) to the 320-dimensional densities of v,
fv
14v5Ddensity ofvfor affected genes, (4.1)
fv
04v5Ddensity ofvfor unaffected genes 1
and

as in (3.1). De/bullet5 ning the likelihood ratio statistic Rv4v5D

f4Zi5=f04Zi5.
In our situation it is not practical to estimate the high- 
dimensional densities fv4v5andfv
04v5, at least not without 
extensive modeling. However, we can easily estimate the cor- 
responding densities f4Z5andf04Z5for a one-dimensional 
statistic Z. The goal is to choose a mapping ZDs4v5that
does not lose much information. I nformation loss manifests 
itself by reductions in the likelihood ratio R4Zi5, compared to 
Rv4vi5, which reduces the number of genes having convinc- 
ingly large values at p14Zi5.
4.1 Estimation of a0
With this background in mind we searched for mappings 
ZDs4v5that produced large values of R4Z5 , i.e., good sep- 
aration between f4Z5 andf04Z5 as in Figure 2. Figure 3 
shows the part of the search relating to the choice of a0in
the denominator of (2.8). The curve marked “ 90” is equiv- 
alent to the dashed curve in Figure 1, the difference here 
being that the vertical axis is plotted on the logit scale, 
logp14Z5=4 1ƒp14Z55, to emphasize differences in the tails. 
Keeping probe reduction (2.6) /bullet5 xed, Figure 3 compares /bullet5 ve 
different choices of a0in the gene reduction (2.8): a0equal to

ward from 106 for a0D90to0fora0D0. Larger values of 
N90 indicate less information loss in going from the full data 
vector vito the summary statistic Zi. (Efron, Tibshirani, Goss, 
and Chu (2001) also use Kulback– Liebler distance to measure 
information loss.) 
Figure 4. Comparison of Various Probe Reductions (gene reduction ’ xed as in (2.8), a0D90th percentile). The solid curve in both panels 
is the choice (2.6) used previously; constant “c” is multiple of mm level subtracted from pm level, for example. “cD1 no logs” uses MikD
mean {pmijk-mmijk}. “ Affy” based on the probe reduction software provided with the Affymetrix Genechip. 4.2 Choosing the Probe Reduction 
The GeneChip software distributed by Affymetrix uses a 
simple average difference, (with some outlier rejection) to 
estimate what we called the probe reduction in (2.4), the 
expression for gene ionplate k2MikDmeanj8pmijkƒmmijk9.
However, this choice is controversial, and some researchers 
have suggested that ignoring the mismatch entirely might pro- 
duce better expression estimates. We investigate the issue here. 
Keeping the gene reduction /bullet5 xed as in (2.6), a0D090,
Figure 4 compares probe reductions of the form 
MikDmeanj8s4pmijk5ƒc¢s4mmijk591 (4.4)
with seither the log function or the identity function. For 
example curve 2 in the left panel uses MikDmeanj8pmijkƒ
mmijk9whereas the dotted curve in the right panel uses 
MikDmeanj8log4pmijk59. Our preferred choice (2.6)– (2.8) is 
curve 1,“cD05 & logs.” The “ Affy” curve in the left panel 
was based on the algorithm provided by Affymetrix, which is 
similar to the “cD1 no logs” choice, but with a provision for 
removing apparent outliers among the 20 pm ijkƒmmijkdif-
ferences before averaging. 
Figure 4 indicates a substantial advantage to taking logs, 
and a mild advantage to using cD05 rather than cD1orcD0.
The comparison between cD05andcD1 is close on the log 
scale, but other comparisons, reported in Efron et al. (2000), 
reinforce the superiority of cD05. We also tried using various 
L-estimators in (4.7), including trimmed means. When applied 
on the log scale, this form of robusti/bullet5 cation made almost no 
difference to our results. 
Some comments are in order, which apply to the whole 
section:
¡There is no claim that the mapping ZDs4v5described by 
(2.6), (2.8) is “ correct,” only that it is relatively ef/bullet5 cient 
in preserving the information in v. The estimated curve Efron et al.: Bayes Analysis of Microarray 1157
p14Z5still is meaningful as the a posteriori probability 
of effect given the insuf/bullet5 cient statistic Z, and also has 
the FDR interpretation of Section 5. (Efron et al. (2000) 
showed that in fact a better “s4v5” can be obtained in the 
radiation experiment by removing plates U1A and I1A 
from the dataset (1.1); a processing error appears to have 
degraded the results from I1A.) Our tactic of choosing 
theZmapping to maximize p14Z5is nearly equivalent to 
minimizing FDR, which was the approach taken in Tusher 
et al. (2000). 
¡There is also no claim that mappings (2.6) and (2.8) 
enjoy general superiority. The equivalent of Figures 3 and 
4 might point to a different choice of s4v5inanother
dataset. Section 6 discusses how our methodology can be 
applied to other comparative microarray experiments. 
¡Over/bullet5 tting is not a threat in a genuine Bayesian frame- 
work, where results like those from Figures 3 and 4 can be 
thought of as just computer-based attempts to numerically 
solve a probabilistic maximization problem. However, in 
our empirical Bayes framework, too much data-based 
maximization could in fact lead to over/bullet5 tting. Two forms 
of bootstrapping were employed as a check on our results: 
“ gene resampling,” in which the rows of the 6 1810/bullet28
matrix Mwere resampled to give Mü; and “ row resam- 
pling” in which row iofMüwas obtained as the average 
of 20 resampled rows from the 20 /bullet28matrix xihaving
entries
xijkDlog4pmijk5ƒ05¢log4mmijk50 (4.5)
The bootstrap results indicated that the differences seen 
in Figures 3 and 4 were much greater than the standard 
errors of the curves, so that over/bullet5 tting was not a threat. 
For example, row resampling showed that the difference 
between thea0D090anda0D050curves atZDƒ3,
which looks suspiciously small in Figure 3, had point esti- 
mate and standard error 068
 013.

to Benjamini and Hochberg’ s FDR criterion. For a collection

gene with score Zis unaffected. It will be shown that (6.1) 
has a natural FDR interpretation. We begin with a numerical 
example.
In the calculations for Figure 1, ND74 of the 6810 
genes hadZscores in the interval Z2610912017, whereas the 
twenty permuted null score datasets 8zi9had 676 falling into 
610912017, an average of 33 08D676=20 per set. Taking p0to
be its estimated maximum .811, this suggests that among the 
ND74binned Zvalues, the expected number of “ unaffect- 
eds” is2704D0811 ¢3308. If we now declare all genes with Z
in610912017to be affected, our expected proportion of false 
discoveries is

In general, if we bin the genes into small intervals on the 
Zscale, then a bin declared “ affected” will have a FDR of 
about fdr4Z5, (5.1), the equality becoming exact as the num- 
ber of genes goes to in/bullet5 nity. This last statement can be rigor- 
ously veri/bullet5 ed under modest ergodic conditions that preclude 
extremely high correlations among the values fo Zorthez.
Figure 5 reports on a simulation experiment used to check 
the accuracy of fdr 4Z5as an estimate of FDR. A 6810 /bullet281158 Journal of the American Statistical Association, December 2001 
matrix Mwas constructed in a way that mimicked the radia- 
tion experiment,

effects” ˆiwere chosen from an N4ƒ105115distribution, 681 
from N4105115, and the remaining 5448 set at zero. In other 
words 80% of the genes were unaffected and 20% were 
affected, 10% in each direction. 
Thematrix Mwas processed into a Zvector according to 
(3.5), and also into twenty zvectors according to (3.7), using 
(2.8) for the mappings from D!Zandd!z. Following the 
same algorithm that lead to Figure 1, these gave an estimated 
fdr4Z5curve, (5.1), that in fact looked much like the one for 
the actual experiment. 
Figure 5 reports on two different choices of a0in(2.8),
a0D090 in the left panel and a0!ˆon the right. There are 
100 points in each panel, corresponding to a binning of the 
fdr axis in units of .01 from 0 to 1, with the jth point plotted 
atfdrjDj=100and
FDRjDproportion of jthbinwith ˆiD01 (5.5)
the empirical FDR for that bin. The FDR jvalues are averages 
over 50 simulations, each of the individual simulations being 
noisy versions of the same picture. If formula (5.1) is actually 
the local fdr, then the points should lie near the main diagonal 
FDR Dfdr as they do. The slight conservative bias FDR jµ
fdrj, came from the fact that the upper bound for p0used in
(5.1) (calculated as in Remark F of Section 6) substantially 
overestimated the true value p0D080.
In the arti/bullet5 cial situation (5.4), taking a0!ˆin (2.8) gives 
a more ef/bullet5 cient choice of Zithan a0D090, doubling N90.
Nevertheless, the inef/bullet5 cient choice a0D090 is still accurately 
calibrated: FDR jPDfdrj.
FDRs are usually de/bullet5 ned for an entire rejection region, for 
example for
²D8Z2R4Z5¶r096R4Z5 Df4Z5=f04Z57 (5.6)
rather than locally as in (5.1). We can think of this as replacing 
our original choice of summary statistic ZDs(v)with
1 Z2²1
eZD if
0 Z62²(5.7)
Assuming that genes having eZD1 are declared affected, 
the empirical Bayes formula (5.1) now becomes 
ffdr415Dp0Qf0415=Qf4151 (5.8)
with straightforward estimate 
Op0proportion 8zi2²9
proportion 8Zi2²90 (5.9)
The heuristic argument proceeding (5.2) is more obvious here: 
(5.9) estimates the proportion of genes in the “ affected” region 
², which is actually unaffected, and in this sense estimates Benjamini and Hochberg’ s FDR. (Current work by the authors 
strengthens this connection: choosing ²in (5.6) as large 
as possible subject to keeping (5.9) below some /bullet5 xed limit 
exactly matches the Benjamini– Hochberg choice of rejection 
region.)
The global de/bullet5 nition of FDR has the advantage of being 
easier to estimate. We can use the totally nonparametric esti- 
mator (5.9) rather than having to estimate the local ratio 
f04Z5=f 4Z5in (5.1). On the other hand (5.8) is a composite 
measure that assigns the same FDR to all the genes in ²even
though some of them have Prob 8Event —Z9much greater than 
others. Comparing (5.1) with (5.8) it is easy to see that ffdr415
is the conditional expectation of fdr 4Z5given Z2²,
ffdr415DEf8fdr4Z5—²9 (5.10)
sothatfdr4Z5is more precise than ffdr415. More on the con- 
nection between FDR and fdr appears in Storey (2001). 
6. SUMMARY AND REMARKS 
The Empirical Bayes procedure described in this article pro- 
vides an effective framework for studying the relative changes 
in gene expression for a large number of genes. It uses a 
simple nonparametric mixture prior to model the population 
of affected and unaffected genes, thereby avoiding parametric 
assumptions about gene expression. We establish a close con- 
nection between the estimated posterior probabilities and a 
local version of the FDR, thereby allowing for the analyst to 
handle multiple testing issues that arise when dealing with a 
large number of simultaneous tests. As we have detailed in 
Algorithm 1 and Remark D, the proposed procedure can be 
applied quiet generally to other kinds of comparative microar- 
ray experiments. 
We conclude with a number of remarks, giving important 
practical details for the proposed methods. 
(A) The Experiment. Lymphoblastoid cell lines GM14660 
and GM08925, (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, 
New Jersey) were seeded at 2 05/bullet2105 cells/ ml. The treat- 
ment consisted of 5 Gy of ionizing radiation. After 24 hours, 
RNA was isolated, labeled, and divided into two aliquots that 
were independently hybridized to the HuGeneFL Genechip 
microarray, Affymetrix Corporation. 
(B) Northern Blot Analysis. Northern Blot Analysis pro- 
duced a quantitative score “Gi” for each of the 18 genes 
indicated in Figure 1, Gstanding for gold standard. Fol- 
lowing previous biomedical convention, Gscores exceeding 
1.30 were taken to indicate a positive effect of radiation on 
gene activity, the “C” symbols in Figure 1; likewise “ƒ”for
Gi<070and“o”for070µGiµ1030. Figure 6 compares the 
Ziscores from Figure 1 with log Gifor the 18 test genes. We 
see a strong monotone relationship, correlation .87. 
The agreement in Figure 6 is impressive, especially con- 
sidering the magnitude of the sampling errors in the individ- 
ual expression values. Our gold standard, the Northern Blot 
score, is not pure gold, itself being subject to experimental 
error. There is only one /bullet6 agrant disagreement in Figure 6, the 
“ƒ”gene atZiDƒ031. The vector of differences (3.4) was 
DiD4ƒ1059105511881ƒ0835for this gene, so that both wild 
types yielded aliquots of opposing signs. I n contrast the “o”Efron et al.: Bayes Analysis of Microarray 1159

point atZiD2051, lying just below the “C” cutoff value GD
1030, was consistently positive, DiD440541208111064120655,
strengthening our belief that this gene was positively affected 
by the radiation. 
(C) Debrightening and Desumming. Some microarray plates 
are “ brighter” than others in that they produce systematically 
larger expression levels. Following probe reduction (2.4) we 
debrightened the data by separately standardizing the columns 
ofM. That is, each column of Mwas linearly transformed to 
have mean 0 and empirical standard deviation 1. 
“ Desumming” corrects for another type of data inhomo- 
geneity. Corresponding to D(3.4), let
SD4M3CM11M4CM21M7CM51M8CM650 (6.1)
A gene with larger Svalues tended to have larger values of 
D, which undercut the exchangeability across genes implicit 
in our empirical Bayes analyses. (Newton et al. 2001 adjusted 
their data for a similar problem.) After debrightening, the indi- 
vidual columns of Dwere desummed as follows: a linear 
regression —Dik—Da0Ca1—Sik—Cerror was /bullet5 t individually to 
each column, and then each Dikwas transformed to 
Dik=4Oa0COa1—Sik—50 (6.2)
Similar transformations were made on the columns of d,
(3.6). It was the transformed Danddmatrices that were 
used to compute the scores Zandzvia (2.8). Desumming 
made almost no difference to the results in Figure 1, but the 
exchangeability issue is an important general point of concern 
for the empirical Bayes analysis, see Remark F. 
(D) Logistic Regression Estimate of f04z5=f 4z5.The ratio
f04z5=f 4z5in (3.8) was estimated by logistic regression. Given 
BD20 replications of z,alln¢41CB5D61810 ¢21scores Ziandziwere plotted on a line, with values of Ziconsidered
as “ successes” and values of z1as “ failures” . The probability 
/bullet64z5of a success at point zis given in terms of the densities 
(3.2),
/bullet64z5Df4z5=4f 4z5CBf04z551 (6.3)
so that (3.8) becomes 
p14Z5D1ƒp01ƒ/bullet64Z5
B/bullet64Z50 (6.4)
With nD61810 genes, the normal scores transformation 
resulted in max 8Zi9Dƒmin8Zi9D3080, whereas the null 
scores 8zi9were con/bullet5 ned to a smaller range, as in Figure 2. 
Our algorithm divided the range 6ƒ4147into 139 equal inter- 
vals, counted the number of values of Ziandziin each inter- 
val, and estimated /bullet64z5by logistic regression, for use in (6.4). 
The regression function was a natural spline with 5 degrees 
of freedom, called by the Splus command ns4x1 dfD55,x
being the 139 center points of the intervals. The choice of 
BD20zreplications was based on an analysis like that 
in Figure 3, which showed considerable improvement for B
increasing from 1 to 10, but little gain past 20. Other methods 
of estimating f04z5=f 4z5are possible, and in fact the details 
of the logistic regression method made little difference to our 
results. The “ global” estimate (5.9) avoids regression entirely, 
at the expense of providing less-speci/bullet5 c results. 
(E) Estimating the Null Distribution. The null density f04z5
is supposed to describe the distribution of expression scores 
for genes unaffected by the treatment of interest. Basing f0on
din (3.6) seems natural for the radiation experiment, but other 
choices are possible and may be necessary for other exper- 
imental designs. Table 2 shows a small portion (5 of 2,638 
genes) of the data from a microarray study comparing two 
different types of liver cancer, 36 Type I patients versus 36 
Type II, with Type II having worse prognosis. Spotted cDNA 
arrays were used, the “ red– green” variety, the tabled values 
being 103¢log (red/green) intensity ratio. The full table cor- 
responds to matrix Min (3.5), now 2 1638/bullet272. Probe reduc- 
tion (2.8) is very simple here, (red, green) !log(red/ green), 
though more ef/bullet5 cient reductions may be possible as shown 
in Dudoit et al. (2000). The analog of Figure 3 indicated a 
preference for a0D0, i.e. for taking Zto be the two-sample 
t-statistic between the Types. 
We obtained the null scores ziand the null density f04z5
by randomly splitting the Type I patients into two groups of 
18 each, say “ A” and “ B,” and likewise “ C” and “ D” for the 
Type II patients, and de/bullet5 ning the values of zast-statistics 
between groups A [Cversus B[D. In other words, we used 
balanced permutations that put equal numbers of those of Type 
I and Type II into each of the two permuted groups; using 
unbalanced permutations would add an unwanted component 
of variance to the null scores. The empirical Bayes analysis 
produced results similar to those in Figure 2, with Type II 
playing the role of the Treatment group. 
As a simple, but informative, model for the radiation exper- 
iment, suppose that Mikin (3.5) can be expressed as

where each ei`is the difference of two values of …ikandeiis
the average of the four values of ei`. The values of zihave the
same expression except that ˆiD0 in (6.6). We can see that 
f04z5is a legitimate null hypothesis comparator for f4Z5.
Suppose we had de/bullet5 ned null scores by differencing across 
wild types instead of across aliquots: dD4M5ƒM11M6ƒ
M21M7ƒM31M8ƒM45replacing (3.6). Then ziwould pick
up an additional term due to the gene/ wild-type interaction 
/bullet3iin (6.5), adding a component of variance to f04z5,and
decreasing the likelihood ratio f4z5=f04z5. Models like (6.5) 
are helpful in guiding the choice of the Zandzmappings,
even if we do not need them for the data-based estimation of 
fandf0.
The additive model (6.5) gives every column of dthesame
distribution, but we might not trust the Treatment differences 
to really have the same distribution as the Control, I2B– I2A 
compared to U2B– U2A for example. Empirically this turned 
out not to be a problem for the radiation experiment, but if it 
had we might have used only the /bullet5 rst and third columns of d
in(3.6).
(F) Better Upper Bound Estimates for “p0.”The upper
bound (3.9), p0µmin8f4Z5=f04Z59, can be poorly estimated 
by the choice min 8Of4Z5=Of04Z59 used in Figure 1. More sta- 
ble upper bounds can be constructed by integrating over an 
interval “¡”near ZD0,
p0µR
¡6f4Z5=f04Z57f04Z5R
¡f04Z5DR
¡f4Z5R
¡f04Z50 (6.7)
Simulation showed that the choice ¡D6ƒ051057performed
better than min 8f4Z5=f04Z59, particularly when the true p0
was near 1. The upper bound (6.7) is directly estimated by 
proportion 8values ofZiin¡9=proportion 8values ofziin¡9,avoiding the logistic regression estimate for f4Z5=f04Z5.This
gave p0µ0825 in the context of Figure 1, not much different 
than the previous estimate p0µ0811. [Received 8 November ,
