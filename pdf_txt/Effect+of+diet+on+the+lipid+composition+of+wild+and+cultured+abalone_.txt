Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) from marine sources have been reported to have beneficial effects on human
health. Previous studies showed that there was a variation of n-3 PUFA concentration and total lipid content between wild andcultured fish (1,3), and wild adult and juvenile cultured abalone (2). However, there are no data available on the variation offatty acid concentration between wild and cultured adult abalone in Australia. We have analysed the fatty acid content of wildand cultured blacklip abalone ( Haliotis rubra ), collected from Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia in September. The cultured
samples were fed a commercial artificial diet. The total lipid was extracted with methanol-chloroform containing butylatedhydroxytoluene. The fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by saponification of about 20 mg lipid plus 2 mg of methyltricosanoate using KOH followed by transesterification in BF
3in methanol. The fatty acid methyl esters were separated by
capillary GLC.
The concentration of total n-3 PUFA, 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3 varied significantly between wild and cultured samples (P < 0.01)
with the higher levels being recorded in wild samples. A significantly higher concentration of n-6 PUFA was also recorded inwild samples than in cultured samples (P < 0.01). 22:5n-3 was a main n-3 PUFA in wild samples but in cultured samples20:5n-3 was higher. Interestingly, a higher total lipid content was found in wild than in cultured samples despite the fact tha t
the natural diet of wild abalone contains less lipid than the artificial diet of cultured samples (2). This study indicates tha t
consumption of wild blacklip abalone will provide a good source of long chain n-3 PUFAs and help to achieve the correctdietary recommendations.
