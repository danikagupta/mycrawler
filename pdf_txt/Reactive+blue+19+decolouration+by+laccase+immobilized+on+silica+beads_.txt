Textile dyes are molecules designed to impart a permanent colour to textile fabrics. They

ofriversandlakes. Currenttechnologiesfordyeremovalcannotremoveallclassesofdyes
and two or more technologies are usually combined to achieve statisfactory decolouriza-
tion efﬁciencies. Lignin-degrading enzymes like laccases are potential technologies for
dyedecolourizationanddecolourizationwithimmobilizedlaccasehasbeenintensivelyin-
vestigated. The majority of those studies however have focused on dye disappearance and
several reported that signiﬁcant dye adsorption had occured during the dye removal, mak-
ing the role of the enzyme unclear. Moreover, textile wastewaters contain auxiliary chem-
icals that can impact enzymatic dye decolourization and very few studies have evaluated
the impact of those substances on laccase. This research evaluated the feasibility of treat-
ing dye-contaminated textile wastewaters with an immobilized laccase system. The ﬁrst
sub-objective was to examined the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 (an anthraquinone
dye) by Trametes versicolor laccase immobilized on controlled porosity carrier (CPC) sil-

sodium sulfate, and sodium chloride on laccase decolourization of Reactive blue 19. De-
colourization of Reactive blue 19 by immobilized laccase was mainly enzymatic although
dye some adsorption occurred. Decolourization led to less toxic by-products from azo and
iindigoid dyes whereas increased toxicity was observed for anthraquinone dyes. The fea-
sibility of immobilizing laccase on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) through its sugar
residues with a simple procedure was demonstrated and the mass of enzyme immobilized
compared well with other commercial acrylic supports. The decolorization of Reactive
blue 19 by laccase was inhibited by the non-ionic surfactant, Merpol by substrate deple-
tion. A model describing this inhibition was developed and was validated by a saturated
equilibriumbindingexperiment. Whilesodiumsulfate(ionicstrength)hadnoeffectonei-
ther ABTS oxidation or dye decolourization, sodium chloride inhibited laccase during dye
decolourization and the type and nature of the inhibition depended on the substrate. With

Introduction
Textiles dyes are poly-aromatic molecules that give a permanently color to materials like
textilefabrics(Vandevivere etal.,1998;ofpublicworksandgovernmentservicesCanada,
2001). Approximately 50,000 tons of dyes per year is loss to the environment world-
wide (Lewis, 1999) and Canada releases 500 tons per year mainly in the St-Lawrence
River (Maguire, 1992). Dyes can create an environmental problem since they resist bio-
degradation,andseveralofthemand/ortheirdegradationproductsaretoxic(Moawad etal.,
2003).Environmental regulatory agencies in several countries are adopting stringent regu-
lationsforthedischargeofcolouredefﬂuentsfromtextileanddyestuffmanufacturers. The
citiesofKingstonandToronto(Ontario,Canada)modiﬁedtheirmunicipalby-lawsin2000
to prohibit the discharge of coloured efﬂuents to the municipal sewage (City of Kingston,
2000; City of Toronto,2000).
Textile wastewaters must be treated since residual dyes are toxic. Studies have shown
that several dyes, in particular azo dyes, are mutagenic as parent molecules or when they
are metabolized (Moawad et al., 2003; Bakshi and Sharma, 2003). As a result, the use
of certain azo dyes in Germany in consumers goods was banned in 1996 (Reid, 1996;
1CHAPTER1. INTRODUCTION 2
ETAD, 1996). Auxiliary chemicals such as solvents, detergents, dispersants and wetting
agents that are used to aid in the dyeing process add to the treatment complexity of textile
wastewaters(Wang etal.,2002). Substanceslikesoapsanddispersantsoftendisruptnitro-
genremovalbynitrifyingbacteriainactivatedsludgeprocesses(Bohm,1994;Vandevivere
et al., 1998). Although manufacturers have made considerable efforts to improve dye ﬁx-
ation, the reduction achieved in residual dye concentration in waste efﬂuents has not been
sufﬁcient (Pierce, 1994). The widespread and increasing use of reactive dyes constitutes
a major part of the problem because these water-soluble dyes pass through the activated
sludge process untreated and are discharged into rivers (Pierce, 1994; Vandevivere et al.,
1998). The discharge of textile dyes into rivers or lakes is the most visible sign of wa-
ter pollution since several are visible at a low concentration of 0.005 ppm (mg/l) (O’Neill
etal.,1999).
Nosingleconventionaltechnologycanremovealltypesofdyesbecausetheirmolecular
structure and chemical properties vary widely and may be complex. Current technologies
such as coagulation, ozonation and activated carbon can efﬁciently remove only restricted
classes of dyes (Dubrow et al., 1996; Hassan and Hawkyard, 2002; Matsui, 1996). Dyes

creates large volumes of sludge, and complicates subsequent disposal operations (Dubrow
et al., 1996; Robinson et al., 2001). A combination of physical, chemical and biological
processes is most efﬁcient for dye decolourization but can be expensive (Hai et al., 2007;
Robinson etal., 2001). Therefore, a more efﬁcientand cost-effectivetreatment is needed.
White rot fungi degrade lignin, a resistant bio-polymer, with their extracellular lignin-
degradingenzymes(LDEs),ligninperoxidase(liP),Manganesedependentperoxidase(MnP)
andlaccase(phenoloxidase),whennutrientlimitationtriggersasecondarymetabolicphaseCHAPTER1. INTRODUCTION 3
(Cameron et al., 2000; Leonowicz et al., 2001; Pointing, 2001). They degrade also a wide
range of persistant organic pollutants including textile dyes (Spadaro and Renganathan,
1994; Wong and Yu, 1999; Heinﬂing et al., 1998; Reyes et al., 1999; Nyanhongo et al.,
2002; Champagne and Ramsay, 2005). Fungal reactors have been developed for dye de-
colourization(Schliephake etal.,1993;YangandYu,1996a,b). Thechallengeindesigning
such reactors for wastewater treatment is maintaining an adequate enzyme concentration
for high dye decolourization efﬁciencies; lignin-degrading enzymes are not continuously
secreted during the secondary phase and are digested by extracellular proteases as part of
the nitrogen turnover of fungi (Dosoretz et al., 1990; Staszczak et al., 2000). In addition,
fungi in reactors entangle with the impeller, increase the medium viscosity, and conse-
quentlyimpedeoxygentransferbecauseoftheirexcessivegrowthandadhesiontosurfaces
(Zhanget al., 1999; Moreira et al., 2003). Using immobilized enzymes to maintain an

and to analyze the impacts of auxiliary chemicals (textile wastewater components) like
surfactantsand salts on enzymatic dye decolourization.
In chapter two, an overview of the the current technologies for dye removal will be
introduced. Dye decolourization by white rot fungi and their enzymes will be reviewed.
This chapter will be concluded by a review of enzyme kinetics fundamentals so that the
reader has the tools necessary to understand the logic behind the models developed in
chapter6 and 7 and howtheywere derived.
The goal of chapter three was to characterize the decolourization of Reactive blue 19,

ter four,the application of immobilized laccase in decolourization was broadened to other
textile dyes and their toxicity before and after enzyme treatment was evaluated. The ﬁfth

2.1 Classiﬁcation of dyes
Dye classiﬁcation is published in the Colour Index (C.I.) (Christie, 2001; Waring and Hal-
las, 1990). The C.I. name of a dye indicates how it is applied to material, its hue (colour),
and its number speciﬁes the chronological order of its commercial introduction (Christie,
2001). TheCIclassiﬁcationisshowninTable2.1(O’Neill etal.,1999). Themostcommon
chemicalclasses include the azo (-N=N-) and carbonyl(C=O) (including anthraquinones).
2.1.1 Azo dyes
Azo dyes like Acid red 27 (Figure 2.1) are the most important class of dyes and constitute
approximately 50 % of commercial dyes and 60 to 70 % of dyes used in traditional tex-
tile applications. They are characterized by their azo bond(s) (-N=N-) which is generally
attached to 2 aromatic radicals. The aromatic ring and the azo bond form the chromogen
(Christie, 2001; Waring and Hallas, 1990). Azo dyes as colourants can provide a complete

range of hues. However, they are more important commercially in the yellow, orange and
red colours (Christie,2001).
2.1.2 Anthraquinone dyes
The anthraquinone dyes form the most important subclass of the carbonyl dyes. The basic
structure of anthraquinone dye includes three membered rings where two carbonyl groups
are located on the middle ring (quinone moiety) (Figure 2.1.2), and the two outer rings
aromatic. Anthraquinones can provide the entire range of hues but are more used for their
violet,blue and green shades (Christie, 2001).
2.1.3 Ingo ¨ıd dyes
The ﬁrst indigo ¨ıd dyes were produced from the plant Indigofera tinctoria by Chinese, In-
dians and Indonesians through a fermentation process. These dyes form the oldest class
of naturally derived dyes. They are recognized for the wide variety of bright blue shades.CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 8
Figure2.2: Reactiveblue 19 (Remazol Brilliant Blue R)
Figure2.3: Acid blue 74 (Indigo carmine)
Nowadays, they are synthesized and used to dye denim jeans and jackets. Acid blue 74 or
indigo carmine(Figure 2.1.3) is a common dye of this class (Christie, 2001).
2.2 Currenttechnologies fordyedecolourization
There is currently no single technology that can decolorize all types of dyes (Talarposhti
et al., 2001). Dye decolourization can occur chemically, physically or biologically. Dyes
can be physically removed by adsorption onto activated carbon for example where no
molecular degradation occurs. In dye degradation, the chromophore (the portion of theCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 9
molecule responsible for color) has been modiﬁed through chemical reactions. Biological
decolourizationcanoccurthroughsorptiontocellularmembraneorbybiochemicaldegra-
dationfrom biocatalysts. In this thesis, dye decolourization means dye degradation.
2.2.1 Activatedcarbon
Activated carbon is used to remove mainly acidic dyes but not reactive dyes (Reife and
Freeman, 1996; Robinson et al., 2001). High removal efﬁciencies are not reproducible if
the sorbent is reused and/or the wastewater characteristics change (Robinson et al., 2001).
Althoughagrowingnumberofreportsonthedevelopmentoflowcostactivatedcarbonare
being published (Kim et al., 2008; Hameed et al., 2008; Nunes et al., 2009), it is mostly
used for efﬂuents with low dye concentrations or is used as a polishing step (Reife and
Freeman,1996).
2.2.2 Flocculation and electro-coagulation
In ﬂocculation, colloids and/or particulates agglomerate as their electrostatic charges are
neutralized by ﬂocculants (e.g., lime, alum, ferric salts or poly-electrolytes). In electro-
coagulation, an electrical current generates ﬂocculants from the anode (Dubrow et al.,
1996; Robinson et al., 2001). These processes have been used to remove dyes and pig-
ment aggregates from textile wastewaters (Essadki et al., 2008; Zidane et al., 2008). The
density of an aggregate can be controlled to enhance its settling or ﬂotation (Kang, 2007).
The optimal concentration of ﬂocculant depends on the static charge of the dye molecule
(Robinson et al., 2001) and must be determined for each dye for efﬁcient removal. How-
ever, these technologies tend to produce large volumes of sludge (suspended solids) andCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 10
thereforerequire adequate space and capacity for disposal (Dubrow et al., 1996; Robinson
etal.,2001).
2.2.3 Fenton’sreagent
Fenton’s reagent combines hydrogen peroxide, H 2O2, and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in solution
and can decolorize a variety of dyes (Sun et al., 2009; Ay et al., 2009; Alshamsi et al.,
2007). The reaction occurs through the followingmechanism,
1.Fe2++H2O2hº
G GGGGG A OH±+OH¡+Fe3+
2.Fe3++H2O2G GG A OOH±+H++Fe2+
and hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals generated can oxidize the dye. Fenton’s reagent
is adequate for toxic wastewaters that inhibit growth of the microbial consortium in the
sludge. However, the large volume of suspended solids that is generally produced through
ﬂocculation requires space and capacity (Robinson et al., 2001; Vandevivere et al., 1998;
Slokarand Majcen Le Marechal, 1998).
2.2.4 Ozonation
Severalstudiesreportedthesuccessfuldecolourizationofdyesolutionbyozonation(Khadhraoui
et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2008). Ozone is a strong oxidizing agent compared to chlorine and
hydrogen peroxide and can degrade a wide range of dyes. Ozonation is mostly used in the
laterstageofthetreatmentprocesssinceitislessefﬁcientintreatinghigh-strengthrawtex-
tilewastewaters(Lu etal.,2009)whichneedadditionaltreatmenttoachieveanacceptable
level of decolourization. The half-life of the ozonide radical (O¢¡
3)ranges from seconds toCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 11
hours depending on the quality of the water and is generally decreased by organics com-
pounds present in the wastewater (von Gunten, 2007). Conditions such as pH must be
tightly controlled because hydroxide anions catalyze the decomposition of ozone (Hoign ´e,
1998). This technology is however applied to efﬂuents with high dye concentrations only
because the capital costs to setup an ozonation facility are substantially higher than other
technologies(Robinson et al., 2001; Vandevivere et al., 1998).
2.2.5 Activatedsludge dyedecolourization
Treatment of textile efﬂuents by activated sludge has been achieved almost exclusively
under anaerobic conditions especially for azo dyes (Knapp and Newby, 1995; Bromley-
Challenor et al., 2000). The toxicity of auxiliary chemicals and dyes to the activated slude
also renders textile wastewater treatment difﬁcult (Talarposhti et al., 2001). Conventional
activated sludge can remove basic and direct dyes mainly through adsorption to the cellu-
lar membrane and shown to be effective (Chu and Chen, 2002; Shaul et al., 1991). It is
inefﬁcient for efﬂuents containing large quantities of reactive and acid dyes diluted with
domestic sewage (Vandevivere et al., 1998; Willmott et al., 1998). A small minority of
bacterial species can aerobically decolorize a restricted number of dyes. A few species of
actinomyceteswereshowntoefﬁcientlydecolorizeandmineralizetextiledyes(Ball etal.,
1989; Zhou and Zimmermann, 1993). Extra-cellular peroxidases produced by the bacte-
ria were shown to mediate decolourization (Paszczynski et al., 1992) and the degradation
pathwaywasdetermined (Goszczynski et al., 1994).CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 12
2.2.6 Anaerobicdyedecolourization
Several bacterial species can decolorize azo dyes under anaerobic conditions. Complete
mineralization of azo dyes, Disperse blue 79 and Acid orange 10, by Bacillus fusiformis
from a dye-contaminated soil (Kolekar et al., 2008) and by a bacterial consortium (Bar-
rag´anetal.,2007)wasrecentlydemonstrated. Decolourizationbeginsbyastrictanaerobic
reductive cleavage of the azo linkage and produces colorless aromatic amines that are po-
tential carcinogens (Mason et al., 1978; Liu et al., 2007). Other researchers have added
anaerobicoxidationsteptodegradeandmineralizetheamines(Libra etal.,2003;O’Neill
et al., 2000; Supaka et al., 2004). The dye molecule is reduced by either azoreductase
(Libraet al., 2003), or by unspeciﬁc cytoplasmic enzymes, which act as azoreductases
(Russet al., 2000). Although signiﬁcant progress has been made, more species that can
completelymineralize textilesdyes need to be isolated.
2.3 Dyedecolourization by white rotfungi
Whiterotfungihavebeenstudiedfornearlythreedecadesandnewspeciesarebeingshown
to decolourize various textile dyes with their lignin-degrading enzymes (LDEs) (Cripps
etal.,1990;ChampagneandRamsay,2005;Bhatti etal.,2008). Ligninperoxidases(LiP),
Mn-dependent peroxidases (MnP) and laccases are secreted when fungi are limited in car-
bon, nitrogen, and sulfur and/or phosphorous sources (secondary metabolism) (Kirk and
Farrell, 1987; Cameron et al., 2000; Leonowicz et al., 2001). Tien and Kirk (1983) re-
ported the ﬁrst dye decolourization by Phanerochaete chrysosporium . Wesenberg et al.
(2003) surveyed 29 white rot fungi capable of dye decolourization. Since then, several in-
vestigatorshaveevaluatedthedecolourizationofcommercialdyesbynewspecies(AsgherCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 13
et al., 2008a; dos Santos et al., 2004; Levin et al., 2004; Mendonc ¸a et al., 2008; Robinson
andNigam,2008). Dyedecolourizationcapabilitiesvarywiththefungalorenzymespecies
(Chagas and Durrant, 2001; Nyanhongo et al., 2002). Cripps et al.(1990) issued the ﬁrst
report demonstrating the major role of lignin peroxidase in P. chrysosporium cultures de-
colourizingOrangeII,TrapeolinOandAzureB.Manganeseperoxidase(MnP)andlaccase

20869)(SwamyandRamsay,1999b)andthecontributionofeachenzymetodyedecolour-
ization depended on the dye (Champagne and Ramsay, 2005). MnP was eight times more
efﬁcient than laccase in decolourizing the azo dye Acid red 27 but did not decolorize Re-
active blue 19, an anthraquinone dye. On the other hand, laccase efﬁciently decolourized
the anthraquinone dye. More recently, the central roles of laccase and manganese peroxi-
daseindecolorizingculturesof Pleurotusostreatus (Faracoetal.,2009)and Shizophyllum
commune IBL-6 (Bhatti et al., 2008) respectively,were demonstrated.
2.3.1 Main lignin-degrading enzymes
Ligninperoxidase(E.C. 1.11.1.14)
Ligninperoxidase(liP)wasdetectedfortheﬁrsttimeinculturesof Phanerochaetechrysospo-
rium(Tien and Kirk, 1983). It is a monomeric N- and O-glycosylated protein expressed
in several iso-forms. LiP contains one iron in a protoporphyrin IX (heme) as a prosthetic
groupanditsmolecularweightvariesfrom38and47kDa. Theenzymeisbasichavingan
iso-electricpointbetween3and5dependingontheiso-form(reviewedbyLeonowicz etal.
(2001)). It requires hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to catalyze a reaction that occurs through a
cycle illustrated in Figure 2.4. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the iron center of the heme to
generateanoxoferryliron(Fe(IV)=O)andanoxidizingequivalentasaradical(compoundCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 14

toreturn to the resting state (PX).
Through this catalytic cycle, liP catalizes C-C and C-O cleavages in side chains of
lignin-likecompoundsleadingingeneraltothedepolymerizationofdimersandoligomers
(de Jong et al., 1994; Spadaro and Renganathan, 1994; Tien et al., 1986). These reac-
tions can involve the oxidation of small molecular weight substrates like veratryl alcohol
(VA) (3,4-dimethoxy phenol) to veratraldehyde where an aryl cation radical intermediate
is generated. The latter is highly reactive and can subsequently oxidize lignin subunits.
Furthermore,veratrylalcoholcanalsoreversethedeactivationoftheenzymecausedbyan
excesshydrogenperoxide (Wariishiand Gold, 1989; Chung and Aust, 1995).
ThevastmajorityofdecolourizationstudieswithliPwereconductedwithazodyesand
this may suggests that liP decolorizes these dyes more efﬁciently than the other classes
of dyes (Cripps et al., 1990; Young and Yu, 1997; Podgornik et al., 1999; Verma and
Madamwar,2002). However,otherinvestigatorshavereportedthedecolourizationoftriph-
enylmethanedyes(Ollikka etal.,1993;Cripps etal.,1990)andmethyleneblue(Ferreira-
Leit˜aoet al., 2007). Spadaro and Renganathan (1994) analyzed the decolourization of the
azo dye, Disperse Yellow 3, by P. chrysosporium liP and proposed a degradation pathway.CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 15
Figure 2.5: Catalytic cycleof Mn(II)-peroxidase (Hofrichter, 2002)
Redox mediators can be used for dyes not directly degraded by the enzyme. For instance,
veratryl alcohol is required to decolorize Reactive Blue 19 (anthraquinone) (Christiana
et al., 2005).
Manganeseperoxidase(E.C. 1.11.1.13)
Manganese peroxidase (MnP) is a glycoprotein containing an iron protoporphyrin group
IX as a prosthetic group. Its molecular weight varies from 40 to 46 kDa. Its iso-electric
point varies from 2.9 to 7.0 depending on the source species of the enzyme and iso-form
(reviewedbyLeonowicz etal.(2001)). For T.versicolor ,theoptimumpHofMnPcanvary

Mn3+can oxidize the aromatic rings of the lignin subunits or other substrates once it
ischelatedtoorganicacidsproducedbyfungi(e.g.,oxalate,malonate). Veryfewphenolic
substrates can reduce MnP compound II to the native ferric state because of the steric hin-
dranceattheactivesite(BoominathanandReddy,1992). LikeliP,MnPisalsodeactivated
byexcesshydrogenperoxide (Wariishi etal., 1988).
The dye decolourization capability of MnP varies from one species to another and de-
pendsontheiso-enzymeandreactionconditions(Li etal.,2009). Ingeneral,MnPrequires
organic acids to decolorize dyes (Young and Yu, 1997). However, Heinﬂing et al.(1998)
showed that P. chrysosporium MnP decolourized little to none of the azo dyes Reactive
blue 38, Reactive violet 5, Reactive black 5, Reactive orange 96, Reactive red 198, and
Reactive blue 15 whereas MnP from Bjerkandera adusta decolorizes all these dyes in the
presence and in absence of Mn2+. Shrivastava et al.(2005) showed that Pleurotus ostrea-
tusMnP decolourized brominated and methylated sulfophthalein dyes less efﬁciently than
theirnon-substituted analogs because of steric hindrance.
Laccase(E.C. 1.10.3.2)
Laccase is a multi-copper glycoprotein and its molecular weight varies from 54 to 383
kDa depending on the fungal species (Baldrian, 2006). The enzyme contains four cop-
pers (Cu2+) with one near the active (type 1 (T1) copper) and a buried cluster of three
coppers with one type 2 (T2) and two type 3 (T3) coppers (Figure 2.6). The T1 copper
extracts electrons from the reducing substrate and transfers it to the tri-nuclear T2/T3 cop-
per cluster where molecular oxygen is reduced to water at T2 copper and T3 coppers act
as electron reservoirs (Claus, 2003, 2004; Bertrand et al., 2002; Bukh et al., 2006). TheCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 17
Figure2.6: Catalytic cycleof laccase (reviewedin Solomon et al.(1996) )
enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds and anilines (Xu, 1996). Laccase

(Solomon etal., 1996).
The oxidation of the substrate limits the overall catalytic turnover as the reduction of
oxygen is relatively fast (Solomon et al., 1996; Bukh et al., 2006). Laccases efﬁciently
decolorizeanthraquinonedyesanddyescontainingphenolicmoietiesandarelessefﬁcient
at decolorizing azo dyes than peroxidases. Electron meditors like hydroxybenzotriazole
(HOBT), various phenolic compounds (Reyes et al., 1999; Michniewicz et al., 2008; Hu
et al., 2009; Murugesan et al., 2009) or few anthraquinones dyes (Wong and Yu, 1999)
can broaden the range of dyes decolourized by the enzyme. The dye decolourization ca-
pability of a laccase depends on its species and strain, and on the structure of the dye.
Nyanhongo et al.(2002) demonstrated that laccases from four white rot fungal species
(T.hirsuta,T.modesta ,T. versicolor andSclerotium rolfsii ) decolourized anthraquinone,CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 18

et al.(2003) reported that T. versicolor laccase (strain CCT-4521) decolourized Reactive
blue 19 only in presence of HOBT, laccase from T.versicolor (ATCC 20869) decolourized
the anthraquinone dye without a redox mediator (Champagne and Ramsay, 2005; Reyes
et al., 1999). Thus, generalized trends for predicting the capability of an enzyme to decol-
orizea targetdye are not alwaysvalid.
2.3.2 Factorsinﬂuencing dyedecolourization by white rotfungi
Nutrientsrequirements
Whiterotfungirequirenutrient-limitingconditionstosecretethelignin-degradingenzymes
and to decolourize textile dyes. Few species like Pycnoporus cinnabarinus are exceptions
since they can decolourize coloured efﬂuents during its growth phase with their constitu-
itively produced laccase (Schliephake et al., 1993). Although nutrient limitation is nec-
essary, minimal amount of carbon and nitrogen sources are needed. Swamy and Ramsay
(1999c) determined that at least 0.5-g/l glucose was necessary for dye decolourization by
Trametes versicolor ; however, excess ammonium cultures inhibited the decolourization
(SwamyandRamsay,1999b). Culturesgrowingwithhighamountsofcarbonandnitrogen
instead (prior to the secondary metabolism) resulted in higher enzyme production and in-
creaseddecolourization rates (Chao and Lee, 1994).
Glucose is the mostly used carbon source for dye decolourization by white rot fungi.
Since it is not abundant in wastewater streams and can be expensive for large-scale treat-
ment, more economical carbon sources are being sought. Kapdan et al.(2000) conducted
dyedecolourizationwith Coriolusversicolor usingmolasses,starchandfructoseandshowedCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 19
thatcolorremovalwasnotasefﬁcientaswithglucoseandthedecolourizationextentvaried.

2.4 Dyedecolourization in white rotfungal bioreactors
Few investigations have evaluated dye decolourization in fungal bioreactors for the design
of continuous decolourization processes. Successful uses of such bioreactors are summa-
rized in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. P. chrysosporium is the most studied species for decolouriza-
tion in bioreactors. In general, decolourization extents reported were reproducible and no
external intervention was needed over a period of 9 to 12 days, after which, decolouriza-
tion efﬁciency would decrease with the enzyme activity. Rodriguez Couto et al.(2000)
suggested that unstable enzyme production in an aged culture was due to the secretion of
extracellularproteases.CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 21Table2.2: Dye decolourization in fungalbioreactors

Sustained enzyme production is an essential requirement for a stable decolourization
process. It depends on the oxygen transfer and nutrient feeding rate (Couto et al., 2004;
Shahvaliet al., 2000; Swamy and Ramsay, 1999a; Li and Jia, 2008). However, good oxy-
gentransferrate ishampered bythe tendencyof thefungalmyceliumto excessivegrowth,
adhesion to surfaces, which ncreases oxygen demand and the medium viscosity (Moreira
et al., 2003). To maximize the operation time of fungal bioreactor, Zhang et al.(1999)
were able to operate a dye decolourizing ﬂuidized bed reactor for two months by cleaning
screens and removing excess mycelia in the reactor each week in order to maintain oper-
ation. Eventually, the reactor was plugged and the decolourization efﬁciency decreased.
Decolourizationresumed once the excessmycelia wasremoved.
The use of rotating biological contactors (RBCs) for white rot fungi is relatively re-
cent, as few investigations have reported its use for the decolourization of dyes (Kapdan
et al., 2000; Ramsay and Goode, 2004; Guimaraes et al., 2005; Nilsson et al., 2006).
Kapdanet al.(2000) showed that the rotational speed, the bioﬁlm thickness and the car-
bon source concentration impacted on the decolourization efﬁciency with C. versicolor
(MUCL).Thickerbioﬁlmswhennutrientconcentrationwashighincreasedthemasstrans-
ferresistance to nutrient transfer and to enzyme secretion.
Dye decolourization in fungal bioreactors needs additional investigations to determine ef-
ﬁcient strategies to sustain a continuous enzyme production and control the growth of the
myceliumas theyare essential for a stable dye decolourization process.CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 24
2.5 Dye decolourization by immobilized lignin-degrading
enzymes
Maintaining a stable enzyme concentration for dye decolourization with white rot fungi is
challenging. Intermittent feeding and appropriate maintenance must be provided and this
may not always be possible in a wastewater treatment process. For example, addition of
highglucoseconcentrationstoprovidedhighenzymeproductionisnotcosteffective(Kap-
danet al., 2000) and more economical and suitable carbon sources are required. While
fungal bioreactors are being developed, the potential of immobilized enzyme reactors is
being seriously examined (Tables 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7). Immobilized peroxidase from
S. spontaneum decolorized six azo, anthraquinone and triphenyl methane dyes (Shafﬁqu
et al., 2002) and T. modesta laccase immobilized on alumina decolourized 41 commercial
azo, triphenyl methane, indigoid and heterocyclic dyes. Of these dyes, 36 were degraded
from 65 % to 100 % and ﬁve dyes were adsorbed and not degraded (Kandelbauer et al.,
2004).
Dye adsorption to the enzyme support is frequent particularly when the material is
polar or charged and may enhance the rate of color removal (Kandelbauer et al., 2004;
Peralta-Zamora et al., 2003; Zille et al., 2003; Reku ´cet al., 2009a). Peralta-Zamora et al.
(2003) showed that IRA-400 ionic exchange resin had the highest adsorption capacity for
the anthraquinone dye, Reactive blue 19, when compared with imidazol-modiﬁed silica
and montmorillonite. T. versicolor laccase on amberlite IRA-400, an anionic-exchange
resin, decolourized Reactive blue 19 with the highest rates compared to when the enzyme

with and without hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), a redox mediator, but the free enzyme
required the mediator to decolorize the anthraquinone dye. The authors concluded that
decolourization with immobilized laccase occurred mainly through dye adsorption since
theratesofdecolourizationwithandwithouttheredoxmediatorwereidentical. Zille etal.
(2003)demonstratedthat90%oftheReactiveblack5decolourizationby T.hirsuta laccase
immobilized on alumina was due to adsorption. Moreover, adsorption was still occurring
even after loss of laccase activity. On the other hand, dye adsorption did not occur dur-
ing decolourization with a plant peroxidase immobilized on polyethylene, a hydrophobic
material(Shafﬁqu et al.,2002).
There are fewer investigations on dye decolourization with immobilized peroxidases
most likely because hydrogen peroxide is required. Hydrogen peroxide must be carefully
addedtothedecolourizationprocessorgeneratedinsitutoavoidenzymedeactivationand
achieveastabledecolourizationprocess(Kim etal.,2005;Conesa etal.,2002;Torres etal.,
2003).Saccharum spontaneum peroxidase immobilized on polyethylene decolourized 15
batches of Procion green HE-4BD. Careful addition of hydrogen peroxide to the reactor
favoured an enzyme half-life of 60 h (Shafﬁqu et al., 2002). When Bjerkandera sp MnP
decolourizedtheazodye,OrangeII,inamembranereactor,49%ofitsinitialactivitywas
lostintwohoursanditwasmoresensitivetoincreasedloadingratesofhydrogenperoxide
(L´opezet al., 2004). However, decolourization was operated under optimized H 2O2and
MnPfeeding rates for eight days with a stable decolourization efﬁciencyof 96 %.
So far, the disappearance of dyes in deﬁned solutions has been the main focus in the
vast majority of dye decolourization studies and more investigations must be conducted in
the context of a textile wastewater since some components may affect dye decolourization
and/ortheenzyme. Theapplicationofdyestofabricsrequiresauxiliarychemicals(dyeingCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 26
aids) such as solvents, detergents, and wetting agents which are present in textile efﬂuents
(Smith, 1986). Non-ionic surfactant like alcohol ethoxylates, alkylphenol ethoxylates, and
ionicethoxylatesurfactantssuchasalkylsulfates,andalkylethersulfatesconstituteamajor

T.hirsuta laccasewasmildlyinhibitedbytextilesurfactantssuchasUnivadinePA(anionic),
Tinegal MR (cationic) but not by Albegal FFA (non-ionic) and the immobilization of the
enzyme on alumina did not eliminate the inhibition. Although, surfactants generally tend
to denature proteins (Madaeni and Rostami, 2008; Otzen et al., 2009), reversed micelles
can stabilize enzymes in the organic phase for enzyme catalysis (Yang and Robb, 2005;

with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to introduce amines and cross-link the en-
zymetothesurfacewithglutaraldehyde(Duran etal.,2002). However,thesematerialstend

2008) and very high laccase activities were reported. Acrylic carriers have good mechani-
caland chemical stability and can be made highly hydrophilic(Mosbach et al.,1976).
The stability of a decolourization process depends on the properties of the enzyme
support. Beads made of brittle materials, like as alumina or silica, erode when mechan-
ically agitated and this results in enzyme loss (Kandelbauer et al., 2004). Wang et al.
(2008a) showed that dye decolourization by laccase encapsulated in alginate-gelatin-PEG

The investigation conﬁrms that a support material must be chosen to maximize enzyme
activity and its mechanical properties and will dictate the conﬁguration of the reactor (e.g.
packedbed reactor vs continuous stirred tank reactor).CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 29Table2.4: Dye decolourization with immobilized lignin-degradingenzymes

2.6 Objectivesof researchproject
According to the literature, laccase has been the preferred lignin-degrading enzyme for
dye decolourization and immobilized laccase reactors have been studied more than im-
mobilized peroxidases (Duran et al., 2002) most likely because the enzyme requires only
oxygenasaco-substrate. Therelativelyhighoptimumtemperaturesoftheenzymeranging
from50to70±C(WangandNg,2006;Rebrikov etal.,2006;Linke etal.,2005;Han etal.,
2005)makesitidealforindustrialapplicationsanditshouldbemoreeasilyintegratedinto
industrial processes. Furthermore, new laccases have been isolated every year since 2004.
Forthese reasons, this research is focusing on laccase for dye decolourization.
The impact of common textile waste efﬂuent components on enzyme activity has not
thoroughlybeeninvestigated. Moststudieshavefocusedonthedisappearanceofdyesand
have not attempted to determine the cause(s) of activity loss. Studying dye degradation
kinetics by immobilized laccase can give more insight on how it is affected by the com-
position of dye efﬂuents and help predict the kinetic behaviour of the enzyme in industrial
dye decolourization. Protein immobilization is an economical and effective means of sta-
bilizing and reusing an enzyme but, as mentioned, the nature of the material can inﬂuence
the enzyme activity retention. Therefore, the ultimate goals of this research project are to
characterize the dye decolourization by laccase immobilized on silica beads and to deter-
mine the effects of auxiliary chemicals on the degradation kinetics of Reactive blue 19, an
anthraquinonedye. Toattaintheseobjectives,theresearchwasdividedintotwomainparts:CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 34

laccase immobilized on controlled porosity carrier silica (CPC)
beads and immobilization of laccase on PMMA.
In the third chapter, dye decolourization by immobilized laccase on controlled porosity
carrier (CPC) silica beads was characterized. The effect of immobilization on the pH ac-
tivity proﬁle of the enzyme toward ABTS and Reactive blue 19 and the contribution of
dye adsorption in decolourization were analyzed. In chapter 3, the decolourization of two
anthraquinone, two azo and one indigoid dyes by free and immobilized laccase was com-
pared and the toxicity of decolourized solutions was analyzed. Chapter four focused on
the immobilization of laccase on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). PMMA was chosen
since it is an abundant and relatively economical material and less brittle than CPC-silica
beads. Furthermore, this polymer is the least hydrophobic of the elastomers and could be
sufﬁcientlyhydrophilicfor good immo iblized laccase activity.

may impact enzyme activity. Therefore, chapter ﬁve focuses on the effects of a non-ionic
surfactant, Merpol, on dye decolourization and these were quantiﬁed by steady-state ki-
netics. Merpol is a non-ionic ethoxylated based surfactant used as a wetting agent and
detergent to clean fabrics during dyeing processes. Finally in chapter six, the effects of
sodium chloride and sodium sulfate on dye decolourization were analyzed and a new dyeCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 35

2.7 Enzyme kinetics fundamentals
Thisreviewon enzyme kinetics isbased on enzyme kinetic textbooksby Segel(1993)and
Leskovac (2003) and is presented so explain the development kinetic models developed
in chapter six and seven and how they were derived. All concentrations and equilibrium
constants are assumed to be in units of molarity unless stated otherwise. An enzyme (E)
acceleratestherateofachemicalreactionbyloweringitsactivationenergy. First,itspecif-
ically binds the substrate (S) and second, it converts substrate to the product (P) (equation
6.1).

respectively.
2.7.1 Derivationof rate equations
Enzyme rate equations can be derived using either the rapid equilibrium or steady-state
assumption.CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 36
Rapidequilibrium assumption
Considertheprevioussinglesubstratereaction(equation6.1)inwhichanenzymecatalyzes
the conversion of a substrate to a product. The binding of S is reversible and the conver-
sion of S to P, the catalytic step, is irreversible or the conversion of the product back to the
substrate is negligible (e.g. at the onset of a reaction). According to the rapid equilibrium
assumption, the rate of association of the substrate to the enzyme, and the rate of dissoci-
ation of the complex is much greater than the rate of generation of the product P enough
that a rapid equilibrium can be established between enzyme-substrate complex, the free
enzyme and the substrate. The procedure to derive a rate equation according to the rapid
equilibriumassumption is as follows:
1. Write a mass balance for the enzyme species. The total enzyme concentration (in
molarity) [E] tis equal to the sum of concentrations of the free enzyme, [E], and of
the enzyme-substrate complex,[ES].
[E]t= [E] + [ES] (2.2)
2. Write the rate equation as a function of the enzyme-substrate complex
v=k2[ES] (2.3)
The unit of the reaction rate, v, is molar concentration per time (e.g., ¹M/min) and
k2isa ﬁrst order rate constant reciprocal time as a unit.CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 37
3. Dividethe rate equation 2.3 by the mass balance (equation 2.2)
v
[E]t=k2[ES]
[E] + [ES](2.4)
4. Express the concentration of each enzyme species in terms of E and S. When the
binding step (binding and dissociation) is at equilibrium, the binding rate between
the free enzyme and free substrate is equal to the dissociation rate of the enzyme-
substratecomplex.
k1[E][S] =k¡1[ES] (2.5)
5. The dissociation constant is deﬁned as the ratio of the dissociation step over the
binding step. The dissociation is also the inverse of the true equilibrium constant for
thebinding step.

k1=[E][S]
[ES]=1

6. Substitute the equilibrium expression(equation 2.6) in equation 2.4

7. Eliminate [E] and multiply the numerator and denominator in the right hand-side of
equation2.7
v=k2[E]t[S]
KS+ [S]=Vmax[S]
KS+ [S](2.8)CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 38
where Vmax=k2[E]t. The dissociation constant KSin units of molar concentration
indicates the afﬁnity of the enzyme for the substrate or the strength of binding. It is also
the substrate concentration at half the maximum initial rate. This mathematical deﬁnition
differsfrom the Michaelis constant which will explainedin the nextsection.
Steady-stateor Briggs-Haldane assumption
In the steady-state assumption, the enzyme-substrate concentration is assumed to be much
less than the substrate concentration and therefore, the rate of change of the complex con-
centration is so small relative to that of the reactant concentration that it can be approx-
imated to be zero (d[ES]
dt= 0). The molar concentrations of ES, E and S do not need
to be in equilibrium and no assumption is made about the relative magnitude of the rate
of product generation and the rate of complex dissociation. When deriving a steady-state
rate equation, the enzyme complex species balances are expressed by a set of differential
equationsdescribing the reactions that haveto be solved.
1. Write the set of differential species balance describing the reactions and the enzyme
conservationequation

2. [ES] is re-expressed in term of [E] and [S] from its corresponding differential bal-
ance,d[ES]

dt= 0,

obtainequation 2.4

that leadsto the formation of the product.
In many cases, either assumption will give the same rate equation for a given kinetic
scheme but the mathematical deﬁnitions or meaning of the equation constants will differ
(e.g. KSvsKM). Otherwise, when the value k2approaches that of k¡1, steady-state
rate equations must be used because the concentration of [ES] is no longer dependent on
[E] and [S] only. The rapid equilibrium assumption is used in chapter six and seven to
derive the kinetic models and to analyze the initial rate data since it is the simplest and
most direct method to derive enzyme rate equations for simple and more complex multi-
ligands reaction schemes and should be considered ﬁrst. If the rapid equilibrium equationCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 41
ﬁts the initial rate data, then the simplest kinetic mechanism is tentatively found and has
to be validated with independent experiments (Segel, 1993). Otherwise, the steady-state
assumption must be used. The algebraic manipulations may become more complicated
as the number of enzyme intermediates increases and schematic (graphical) methods for
deriving rate equations like that of King and Altman (1956) must be used to minimize the
risksof mistakes.

During a steady-kinetics experiment with a bisubstrate reaction, one substrate concen-
tration is varied while the other is kept constant. For laccase, the oxygen is concentration
is assumed to be constant (at 8.04 mg/l or 259 ¹M) for the duration of the enzyme assay
if the substrate conversion does not exceed 10 % and if the substrate concentration largely
exceeds that of the enzyme. It is then possible to rearrange equation 2.20 to the general

to displace inhibitor molecules from the active site. Vmaxork2(turnover number) is not

Uncompetitiveinhibition
In uncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor only binds to the enzyme-substrate complex and
not the free enzyme ( KI;1¡! 1). The inhibitor binding site appears only when the
substrate is bound to the enzyme. The true KMandk2are decreased to the same extent so
that thecatalytic efﬁciencyis not altered.

The Lineweaver-Burk yields a set of parallel lines (identical slopes) with different in-
tercepts,which increase with the inhibitor concentration (Figure 2.9C).
Mixedinhibition
In this type of inhibition, the inhibitor binds to both the free enzyme and the enzyme-
substrate complex with different afﬁnity so that the alteration in the true k2;appandKM;app
variesaccording to the afﬁnityof the inhibitor to enzyme species:CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 50

2.7.5 Non-linear enzyme inhibition
The theory of the non-linear inhibition is presented in this section and includes the deriva-
tion of the rate equations 7.2 and 7.3 in chapter 7. There are two types of non-linear in-
hibition. Hyperbolic (partial) mixed-type inhibition occurs when the enzyme can generate
a product despite being bound to an inhibitor and parabolic inhibition occurs if more than
oneinhibitormoleculecanbindtotheenzyme. Theenzyme-inhibitor,EI,inFigure2.10is
Figure2.10: General partial mixedinhibition (hyperbolic)
allowed to bind to the substrate and to generate a product. The bound inhibitor can affectCHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 51
the enzymes afﬁnity for the substrate by factor ®. The parameter ¯is a fraction and is the
effectiveness for the complex ESI to generate the product and can take values between 0
and1. The rate equation describing the kinetic scheme is

Hyperbolic inhibition can be detected by plotting the slopes or the intercepts from the
Lineweaver-Burk plots as function of the inhibitor concentration and the curve will be
hyperbolic(Figure 2.11A).
Parabolic inhibition occurs when more than one inhibitor binding site exist and is usually
complete, i.e. no product can be generated by the enzyme when all inhibitor sites are
occupied. Parabolic inhibition is indicated if the replot of the Lineweaver-Burk slopes
showsaparaboliccurve(Figure2.11B).ConsidertheparabolicinhibitionkineticinFigure
2.12. Inthisscheme,theinhibitor(I)canbindtwoindependentsiteswiththesameafﬁnity,
i.e., the inhibition constant, KI, is identical for both inhibitor binding sites. The ®factor
indicates that binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate S. The enzyme-
substrate with one inhibitor molecule can generate the product by a fraction ¯ofk2but it
cannot when two inhibitor molecules are bound. The rate equation for this kinetic scheme

To recapitulate, this section on enzyme kinetics has been presented to explain the de-
velopment of the kinetic models developed in chapter six and seven, the process by which
theywere derived,and howto interpret them.CHAPTER2. LITERATUREREVIEW 53

3.2 Introduction
Environmental regulations of the discharge of coloured efﬂuents have become more strin-
gent because approximately 50,000 tons of toxic textile dyes are released into the envi-
ronment every year worldwide (Lewis, 1999). In Canada, the discharge of coloured ef-
ﬂuents to municipal sewage is prohibited in the cities of Kingston and Toronto (City of
Kingston, 2000; City of Toronto, 2000). A combination of physical, chemical and biolog-
ical processes can efﬁciently treat coloured efﬂuents (Robinson et al., 2001) but a single
technologymay be more cost-effective.
White rot fungi degrade a wide range of persistent organic pollutants like phenols (Ko
and Chen, 2008; D’Annibale et al., 2000; Hublik and Schinner, 2000; Zhang et al., 2008),
pesticides (Jolivalt et al., 2000) and textile dyes with their lignin-degrading enzymes such
as lignin peroxidase, manganese (II)-dependent peroxidase and laccase (phenol oxidase).
Laccases degrade dyes with phenolic and quinone moieties efﬁciently and may need a
redox mediator like hydroxybenzotriazole for dyes that do not include these molecular
features (Reyes et al., 1999; Nyanhongo et al., 2002; Peralta-Zamora et al., 2003; Couto,
2007).

it would greatly reduce enzyme loss and allow re-use. Laccase immobilized on various
supports has been evaluated for the treatment of pollutants such as phenols (Shuttleworth
andBollag,1986;DuranandEsposito,2000;Duran etal.,2002)butfewhaveinvestigated
dye decolourization. Immobilization of laccase on imidazol-modiﬁed silica gel (Peralta-
Zamoraet al., 2003) and silanized alumina particles (Zille et al., 2003) have shown that
while both enzymatic degradation and sorption contributed to dye removal, the contribu-
tion of enzymaticdecolourization wasquite minor.
Althoughmanystudieshavepreviouslydealtwithimmobilizedlaccaseonsilica(Duran
etal.,2002),ithasnotbeenusedfordyedecolourizationtoourknowledge. Inaddition,the
immobilization can change an enzymes kinetic behaviour and response to environmental
conditions and these must also be quantiﬁed for design purposes. This study therefore
evaluates the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 (Figure 3.1), an anthraquinone dye, by
Trametesversicolor laccase immobilized on controlled porosity carrier (CPC)-silica beads
and the impactof protein immobilization on dye decolourization.CHAPTER3. RB19 DECOLOURIZATIONBY IMMOBILIZED LACCASE 71
3.3 Materials and Methods
3.3.1 Chemicals
Pre-silanized (with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)) CPC silica beads, Trametes
versicolor laccase, Reactive blue 19 and 2,2’-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid)(diammoniumsalt)werepurchasedfromSigma-Aldrich(Oakville,ON,Canada)and
glutaraldehydefrom Acros (Belgium).
3.3.2 Surface areaof beads
ThesurfaceareawasdeterminedbymeasuringtheamountofN 2gasadsorbedonthebeads
at different partial pressures (de Kanel and Morse, 1979) with a Micrometric Tristar 300
(MicrometricInstrument Corp).
3.3.3 Immobilization of laccase on CPC-Silica
Four grams of pre-silanized CPC-silica beads (355 to 600 ¹m in diameter, an average
surface area of 42.1 m2/g and a pore size of 37.5 nm) were immersed in degassed 2.5
% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M KH 2PO4at pH 5.0 for 2 h and thereafter placed in a laccase
solution ( 3 U/ml in 0.1 M KH 2PO4pH 5.0) for 36 h at 4±C. The beads were subsequently
washedthree times with distilled waterand twice with phosphate buffer.
3.3.4 Freeand immobilized enzyme assay
Laccase activity was measured by monitoring with a spectrophotometer the generation of
2,2’-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radicals (ABTS²¡) at 420 nm from
the oxidation of ABTS (Wolfenden and Willson, 1982) at 23 §1±C using a SpectramaxCHAPTER3. RB19 DECOLOURIZATIONBY IMMOBILIZED LACCASE 72
250platereaderwiththeSOFTmaxPROsoftwarepackage(MolecularDevices,CA,USA).
The assay mixture contained 0.2 mM ABTS, 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and
theenzymesample(Bourbonnais etal.,1995). Oneunitoflaccaseactivity(U)wasdeﬁned
as the amount of enzyme that formed 1 ¹mol ABTS²¡per min. Protein concentration was

(3.1)
For the immobilized laccase system, the CPC silica-laccase packed bed reactor (I.D. = 10
mm, l = 23 mm) was connected to a reservoir containing 100 ml of 50 mM sodium ac-
etate/50mM KH 2PO4(pH5) viaa peristalticpump. The solutionwas100% re-circulated
between the packed bed and the reservoir at a ﬂow rate of 75 ml/min. To determine the
immobilized laccase activity, the linear variation of the concentration of ABTS²¡in the
reservoirwith time wasmeasured for a 6 or 10 minuteinterval.
3.3.5 Decolourization of Reactiveblue19 by freelaccase
Reactive blue 19 (0.036 mM or 22.5 mg/l) was decolorized with 5-7 U laccase in 125-ml
Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 50 ml 0.1 M KH 2PO4at pH 5.0. Controls were identical but
did not contained laccase. All experiments were done at 23 §1±C and pH 5. The dye
concentration was chosen since it is in the range of the typical dye concentration found in
textilewastewaters(O’Neill etal.,1999)CHAPTER3. RB19 DECOLOURIZATIONBY IMMOBILIZED LACCASE 73
3.3.6 Dyeconcentration
Reactive blue 19 concentration was measured using a Unicam UV1 spectrophotometer
(SpectronicUnicam,Cambridge,UK)at592nm,themaximumwavelengthofabsorbance.
The concentration of 0.036 mM (50 ppm) was chosen since it is typical of residual dye
concentrationfound in a textilewastewater(O’Neill etal.,1999).
3.3.7 Decolourization of Reactiveblue 19 by immobilized laccase
A solution of Reactive blue 19 (0.036 mM) was continuously re-circulated at 4.15 ml/min
(equivalent to a hydraulic retention time of 2.44 min) from a reservoir containing 400 ml
of dye solution to a packed bed reactor (I.D. = 1.6 cm, h = 5.0 cm) with 4 g of CPC-
silica-laccase beads. Figure 3.2 shows a schematic of the experimental setup. The bed and
voidvolumeswereabout10and1.6mlrespectively. Afterdecolourization,thebeadswere
stored in 0.1 M KH 2PO4buffer at pH 5 and 23 §1±C for 4 months. The rate of decolour-
ization was calculated by dividing the concentration difference between the reactor inlet
and outlet by the hydraulic retention time. The average rate was calculated by averaging
the decolourization rates in the reactor over the time interval during which the rates were
approximatelyconstants. Therateconstantwascalculatedbydividingtherateofdecolour-
ization in the reactor by average concentration in the reactor C inlet(see Appendix D.2 for
a sample calculation). After storage, Reactive blue 19 decolourization was measured. All
experimentswere done at 23 §1±C and pH 5.

To determine if ethanolamine treatment after laccase immobilization would reduce
dye adsorption, CPC-silica-laccase beads were treated with 1 M ethanolamine and 0.2 M
borane-dimethyl amine. Laccase on treated and untreated beads was inactivated by auto-
claving for 20 min at 121±C and thereafter exposed to 50 ml of 0, 39.9, 79.8, 119.7 and
159.6 ¹M Reactive blue 19 in 50 mM KH 2PO4at pH 5 and 23.0±C for 24 h in 125 ml
erlenmeyer ﬂasks. Inactivation was conﬁrmed since no laccase activity was detected after
autoclaving. Equilibrium wasachievedin approximately 8 h.CHAPTER3. RB19 DECOLOURIZATIONBY IMMOBILIZED LACCASE 76
3.4 Results
3.4.1 Enzyme immobilization on CPC-silica
Glutaraldehyde was used to crosslink laccase to pre-silanized CPC silica beads. The ac-
tivity of immobilized laccase calculated from the declined activity in the supernatant from
three independent experiments was 31.5 §4.3 U/(g beads) with a protein loading of 185
§58¹g/(gbeads). However,themeasuredimmobilizedenzymeactivityonthebeadswas
1.11§0.12 U/g.
3.4.2 Dyedecolourization by freeor immobilized laccase
Good decolourization rates of Reactive blue 19 were achieved in a re-circulating packed
bedreactorwithlaccaseimmobilizedbeads(Figure3.3). Astherecirculationrateincreased
from 4.15 to 32.8 ml/min, the decolourization rate increased from 11.98 to 47.07 ¹M/U-h.
These rates are better than those obtained with the free enzyme which decolorized 90 %
of Reactive blue 19 at an initial rate of 8.25 ¹M/U-h. The free enzyme activity remained
constantduring the three hours of decolourization.
3.4.3 Stability of decolourizing activity
After4monthsofstorageat23 §1±CandpH5in0.1MKH 2PO4buffer,immobilizedlac-
case decolourized Reactive blue 19 to a similar extent and rate as freshly prepared beads.
After storage, 80 to 71 % decolourization was achieved in three successive decolouriza-
tions over 120 hours (Figure 3.4) with average pseudo-ﬁrst order reaction rate constant of
1.28§0.03, 1.31 §0.04 and 1.51 §0.03 h¡1in the ﬁrst, second and third decolouriza-
tions respectively. The pseudo-ﬁrst order rate constants were calculated by dividing theCHAPTER3. RB19 DECOLOURIZATIONBY IMMOBILIZED LACCASE 77

3.4.5 Contributionof adsorptionto dyedecolourization

3.5 Discussion
The retained activity of immobilized laccase based on the declining activity in the super-
natant (during the enzyme immobilization) did not reﬂect the measured activity. The latter
was3.5%(1.11U/g)ofthecalculatedactivity(31.5U/g). TheABTSconcentrationusedto

and/or to diffusion limitations. Mass transfer resistance in enzyme reactors is common in
packedbeds of porous enzyme supports (Barros et al.,1998; Kallenberg et al., 2005).
In the few decolourization studies in which laccase was immobilized on a solid sup-
port,themajorityofdyeremovalwasduetoadsorption. Abadulla etal.(2000),Zille etal.
(2003) and Kandelbauer et al.(2004) used the same immobilization method, cross-linking
laccase onto silanized alumina with glutaraldehyde. The ﬁrst two studies both worked
with Reactive black 5 but only Zille et al.(2003) reported that the majority of dye decol-
oration(79%)wasduetoadsorptionandaveryminoramount(4%)toenzymaticactivity
while Abadulla et al.(2000) did not comment on sorption taking place. In another study,
Kandelbauer et al.(2004) noted that adsorption played a role in decolourization but did
not determine the extent of its contribution. Peralta-Zamora et al.(2003) showed that the
majority of color removal of Reactive blue 19 (also named Remazol Brilliant Blue R in
their paper) was due to adsorption with laccase immobilized on imidazol-modiﬁed silica
gel. In our study, which also used Reactive blue 19, the majority of dye (about 97 %)
wasenzymaticallydegradedeventhoughaninitial,rapidadsorptionoccurred. Initially,the
rate of adsorption must have been faster than the rate of degradation to obtain the intense
blue colour. However, as the aqueous dye concentration decreased, the amount of adsorp-
tion must have decreased relative to the rate of dye degradation such that the intense blue
colourgradually disappeared leavinga pale pink colour on the activelaccase bed.
AkeyreasonwhyourresultsdifferedfromthoseofPeralta-Zamora etal.(2003)maybein
the immobilization method. They cross-linked laccase to silica gel using propylimidazol.

copper in laccase leading to enzyme inactivation. In our study, laccase was immobilized
onCPC-silicausingAPTES-glutaraldehydewhichlinkedtheaminegroupsontheenzyme
and the bead surface. This method has been shown in the literature to retain a high level
of laccase activity (Duran et al., 2002). Furthermore, from our results, laccase activity did
not appear to be adversely affected as decolourization rates per unit of enzyme activity for
the immobilized enzyme was as good as or better than the free enzyme. In addition, the
trend of the pH proﬁle of dye decolourization did not change after immobilization. The
lowdecolourizationratesatpH6and7weredifﬁculttomeasureprobablybecauseofmass
transferresistance.
Immobilizing laccase however drastically altered the pH proﬁle of ABTS oxidation. The
two-unit shift of the optimum pH towards more alkaline values indicates that the local im-
mobilized enzyme micro-environment has a net negative charge (Goldstein, 1976). In a
negatively charged microenvironment, the local proton concentration is greater than the
bulk concentration. The excess pH could have inhibited the enzyme. The pKa of ABTS is
2.2anditisexpectedtobeintheformofthedianionpredominantly(Scott etal.,1993). As
it approached the microenvironment however, it may have been neutralized by the excess
protons so that its oxidation to a cation was disfavored by the excess of positive charges.
As the pH is increased, the concentration of the buffer weak base that transports the pro-
tons away from the microenvironments increased. The generation of the cation would be
more favorable because of the reduced proton concentration. The large shift differs with
the results of Leonowicz et al.(1988) who showed a much smaller shift of 0.5 units with
T.versicolor laccase immobilized on porous glass beads. The difference may be related to
the average pore size of the beads used in this study was half of that used by the authors
(37.5˚A as opposed to 75 ˚A). This can greatly restrict the diffusion of the protons therebyCHAPTER3. RB19 DECOLOURIZATIONBY IMMOBILIZED LACCASE 84
creatinga largerpH gradient between micro-environmentand the bulkmedium.

more stable than the free enzyme, laccase immobilized on alumina had a lower stability
than the free enzyme in dyeing efﬂuents (Zille et al., 2003). The composition of dye ef-
ﬂuents and different dye structures will inﬂuence enzyme stability (Reyes et al., 1999; Ko

be investigated before this process can be considered for industrial applications. However,
being able to store the immobilized laccase in a simple buffer under ambient conditions
wouldallowtheir re-use and could haveeconomic and practical advantages.

4.1 Abstract
The toxicity and decolourization of textile dyes by laccase immobilized on CPC-silica
beads were evaluated. Anthraquinone (Reactive blue 19 and Dispersed blue 3) and in-
digoid (Acid blue 74) dyes were degraded more rapidly than the azo dyes (Acid red 27
andReactiveblack5). Furthermore,theimmobilizationproceduredidnotalterthelaccase
decolourizationefﬁciency. Visibledyeadsorptioncorrelatedwiththelossofactivityofthe
free enzyme in the presence of individual dyes. Azo and indigoid dyes were more toxic
than anthraquinone dyes as determined by the Microtox assay. However, the toxicity of
theazoandindigoiddyesdecreasedafterenzymatictreatmentwhilethatofanthraquinone
dyes increased. This indicates that the decolourization products of anthraquinone dyes are
89CHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 90
potentiallymore toxic than the parent compounds.
4.2 Introduction
Residual dyes in textile wastewaters, when discharged in aquatic ecosystems, may reduce
the amount of sunlight to photosynthetic organisms which results in a decrease oxygen
levels. Domestic activated sludge processes poorly remove dyes because they and/or their
auxiliary chemicals are generally toxic to microorganisms (Rosa et al., 2001; Moawad
et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2002). Physical color removal methods (such as activated carbon
and coagulation) require subsequent disposal steps since dyes are not degraded, but just
transferred to a different phase (Reife and Freeman, 1996; Robinson et al., 2001). Current
individualtechnologiesarenoteffectivewithalldyeclassesandacombinationofmethods
may be required, thus increasing treatment costs (Talarposhti et al., 2001). Therefore, a
morecost effectiveand efﬁcienttreatment is needed.
Extracellular lignin-degrading enzymes of white rot fungi like peroxidases and laccases
candecolourizedyesinliquidcultures(Kirby etal.,2000;ChampagneandRamsay,2005;
Husain, 2006; Wesenberg et al., 2003). Immobilization of these enzymes is potentially
more cost-effective as it would allow their re-use and may improve enzyme stability. Al-
though puriﬁed fungal laccases have decolourized azo (Salony et al., 2006), acid (Salony
et al., 2006; Younes et al., 2007) and anthraquinone (Lu et al., 2007; Younes et al., 2007)
dyes, most studies have evaluated immobilized laccase to remove pollutants such as pesti-
cides and phenols from synthetic wastewaters (Yinghui et al., 2002; Jolivalt et al., 2000).
Dye decolourization using laccase immobilized on imidazol-modiﬁed silica gel (Peralta-
Zamoraet al., 2003) or silanized alumina particles (Zille et al., 2003) occurred mainlyCHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 91
by adsorption, and to a lesser extent, by enzymatic decolourization. In Chapter 3, it was
demonstrated that laccase immobilized on controlled porosity carrier (CPC) beads using
APTES-glutaraldehyde decolourized Reactive blue 19, an anthraquinone dye, mainly by
enzymatic degradation. However, the decolourization of other textile dyes by the same
immobilized laccase preparation and the effect of immobilization on the decolourizing ca-
pability of laccase were not evaluated. The latter is important since immobilization should
not impair decolourization efﬁciency. Furthermore, there are few reports on the toxicity
of dyes decolourized by fungal cultures (Ramsay and Nguyen, 2002; Shin and Lee, 2000),
andevenfewerondyesdecolourizedbyfreeorimmobilizedlaccase(Abadulla etal.,2000;
UlsondeSouza etal.,2007). Fungalculturesproducemixturesofdifferentchemicalcom-
position than puriﬁed enzymes, and hence possibly different toxicities. This study com-
pared the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 with another anthraquinone dye (Disperse
blue 3), an indigoid dye (Acid blue 74) and two azo dyes (Acid red 27 and Reactive black
5) byTrametes versicolor laccase immobilized on CPC-silica beads and the impact of de-
colourizationon toxicity.

chasedfrom Acros (Belgium).CHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 92
4.3.2 Immobilization of laccase on CPC-silica
Fourgramsofpre-silanizedCPCsilicabeads(355to600mindiameter,anaveragesurface
areaof42.1m2/gandaporesizeof37.5nm)wereimmersedindegassed2.5%glutaralde-
hydein0.1MKH 2PO4atpH5.0for2handthereafterplacedinalaccasesolution( ˜3U/ml
in 0.1 M KH 2PO4pH 5.0) for 36 h at 4±C. The beads were then washed three times with
distilledwaterand twice with phosphate buffer.
4.3.3 Freeand immobilized enzyme assay
Laccase activity was measured by monitoring with a spectrophotometer the generation of
2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radicals (ABTS²¡) at 420 nm from
the oxidation of ABTS (Wolfenden and Willson, 1982) at 23 §1±C using a Spectramax
250platereaderwiththeSOFTmaxPROsoftwarepackage(MolecularDevices,CA,USA).
Assays were conducted in 96-well plates (300 ¹l per well). The assay mixture contained
0.2 mM ABTS, 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) (Bourbonnais et al., 1995) and
the enzyme sample for a total assay volume of 180 ¹l. The corresponding path length of
absorbance was 0.5 cm . One unit of laccase activity (U) was deﬁned as the amount of
enzyme that formed 1 ¹mol ABTS²¡per min. Protein concentration was measured as the
absorbance at 280 nm and corrected for scattering effects with absorbance readings at 320
nm(equation 4.1.

(4.1)
For the immobilized laccase system, the CPC silica-laccase packed bed reactor (I.D. = 10
mm, l = 23 mm) was connected to a reservoir containing 100 ml of 50 mM sodium ac-
etate/50mM KH 2PO4(pH5) viaa peristalticpump. The solutionwas100% re-circulated
between the packed bed and the reservoir at a ﬂow rate of 75 ml/min. To determine theCHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 93
immobilized laccase activity, the linear variation of the concentration of ABTS²¡in the
reservoirwith time wasmeasured for a 6 or 10 minute interval.
4.3.4 Decolourization by freelaccase
All dyes were decolourized with 100 -150 U/l (i.e. 5-7.5 U) laccase in 125-ml Erlenmeyer
ﬂasks containing 50 ml phosphate buffer (0.1 M KH 2PO4at pH 5.0) at 23 §1±C and
pH 5. The concentration of Dispersed blue 3 (0.072 M) was twice the concentration of
other dyes (0.036 M) as the absorbance of its solution at the lower concentration was too
low to monitor its degradation. The concentration of 0.036 mM for each dye (except for
Disperse blue 3) was chosen since it is typical of residual dye concentration found in a
textile wastewater (O’Neill et al., 1999). Controls contained the dye solutions without
laccase. Theinitialratesofdegradationsweredeterminedbycalculatingthetangentofthe
slopeof the decolourization progress curve.
4.3.5 Decolourization by immobilized laccase
Four grams of CPC-silica beads with 31.5 §4.3 U of laccase/g (i.e. 0.75 §0.10 U/m) or
4.39§1.38¹gofprotein/m2immobilizedwereusedinare-circulatingpackedorﬂuidized

ml/min(hydraulicresidence time(HRT)=2.44 min)from areservoircontaining400 mlof
the dye solution to a packed bed (I.D. = 1.6 cm, h = 5.0 cm). For the azo dyes, a similar
conﬁguration was used except that the beads were ﬂuidized in a 14-ml bed (I.D. = 1.6 cm,
h = 7.0 cm) at a ﬂow rate of 45 and 39 ml/min (HRT = 0.31 min) respectively with 100 ml
of dye solution in the reservoir. The rate of decolourization was calculated by dividing the
concentration difference from the reactor inlet and outlet by the hydraulic retention time.CHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 94
Theaverageratewascalculatedbyaveragingthedecolourizationratesinthereactoratover
the time interval in which the rates were approximately constants. Experiments were done
at23§1±C and pH 5.
4.3.6 Dyeconcentration
DyeconcentrationwasmeasuredusingaUnicamUV1spectrophotometer(SpectronicUni-
cam,Cambridge, UK) at the maximum wavelengthof each dye (Table4.1).
4.3.7 Microtoxanalysis
The Microtox acute toxicity assay was conducted with a Microtox 500 Analyzer on dye
solutionsaccordingtotheprotocolsprovidedbyAzurEnvironmental(Newark,Delaware).
The pH of the samples was adjusted where necessary to 6.0 by adding 70 ¹l 1 M NaOH.
From eight serial dilutions, the percent dilution which decreased the luminescence of a
modiﬁed strain of Vibrio ﬁscheri after 15 min incubation by 20 % (EC20%) was deter-
mined using the Microtox data analysis program (Microtox Omni Software (1999) Azur
Environmental, Newark, Delaware, USA). Color correction was not necessary. Solutions
of zinc sulfate (ZnSO 4¢7 H2O) and 1 g glucose/l prepared in distilled water were used as
the positive and negative controls respectively. Each EC20% reported was the average of
triplicateanalyses.
4.4 Results
Immobilized laccase, like the free enzyme, decolourized the indigoid (Acid blue 74) and
anthraquinone (Reactive blue 19, Dispersed blue 3) dyes more rapidly than the azo dyes
(). The indigoid and anthraquinone dyes did not affect the activity of free laccase in upCHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 95

to 3 hours of decolourization, maintaining 100 % of its activity. The free enzyme activity
however decreased by 33% and 97 % with azo dyes Acid red 27 and Reactive black 5 re-
spectively after 84 h (Table 4.2). Since a 60 % loss of activity also occurred with no dye
after84 h, Reactiveblack 5 clearly inhibited laccase activity.
When the dyes were ﬁrst exposed to the immobilized enzyme, an initial, rapid adsorp-
tion to the enzyme bed was observed with all dyes except Acid blue 74. By the end of the
decolourization, the adsorbed colour disappeared or persisted to varying degrees depend-
ing on how efﬁciently laccase degraded the dye. At the end of the experiment, the order in

the dye solutions were categorized as follows: >100 % = non-toxic; 100-75 % = slightly
toxic; 75-50 % = moderately toxic; 50 25 % = toxic; <25 % = very toxic. The negative

toxic while the buffer alone was moderately toxic. The azo and indigoid dyes were more
toxic than the anthraquinone dyes. Similar results were obtained whether the dyes were
decolourizedbythefree orimmobilized enzymeexceptforAcid red27 wherethetoxicity

4.5 Discussion
The present study evaluated the decolourization of a range of dyes by the same immobi-
lized laccase preparation used to decolourize Reactive blue 19 in Chapter 3. Like Reactive
blue19,theimmobilizedenzymedecolourizedDisperseblue3(anthraquinone),Acidblue
74 (indigoid), Acid red 27 (azo) and Reactive black 5 (azo) with a similar speciﬁcity and
rate as the free enzyme (Table 4.2). Protein immobilization can modify or deactivate the
enzyme if immobilization conditions are not appropriate. For example, excess glutaralde-
hyde, a common bifunctional cross-linker, can signiﬁcantly cross-link enzymes to each
other resulting in a loss of functionality. In this study, the speciﬁcity of soluble and immo-
bilizedlaccasetowardthedyeswasnearlyidentical(Table4.2)andtherewasnosystematic
variationintherateofdecolourizationperunitofenzymeafterimmobilization. Thenearly
identical speciﬁcity before and after immobilization demonstrates that the enzyme’s struc-
ture was unaffected during immobilization and/or any change in the enzyme structure did
not affect its ability to degrade the dyes after immobilization. Furthermore, the substrate’s
access to the immobilized enzyme was not restricted by the mass transfer resistance and
therecirculationrateinthepackedbedreactorwassufﬁcientlyhightoensuregoodmixing.
Theboundarylayermayhavebeensufﬁcientlythinthatforcedconvectionwouldhavebeen
the dominant transport mechanism of the dye to the immobilized laccase rather than free
diffusion. In light of these results, the immobilization protocol used in this investigation
did not impair enzyme decolourization and may allow advantages in terms of enhanced
stabilityand economy of reusing the immobilized laccase in industrial applications.
AlthoughitwaspreviouslyshownthatdecolourizationofReactiveblue19wasmainlyen-
zymaticwhenlaccasewasimmobilizedonCPC-silica,itwasobservedinthepresentstudy
thatdyespoorlydecolorizedbythefreelaccaseadsorbedontotheimmobilizedpreparationCHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 101
(Table 4.3). Dyes, which adsorbed the least or not at all, were decolourized the fastest.
Sinceanthraquinone(Reactiveblue19,Dispersedblue3)andindigoid(Acidblue74)dyes
were degraded more efﬁciently than the azo dyes (Acid red 27 and Reactive black 5), they
were better substrates for laccase as it is generally reported in the literature (Nyanhongo
et al., 2002). Zille et al.(2004) has shown that an increased redox potential of the dyes
decreased the rate or extent of decolouration with a T. villosa laccase. The most poorly
decolorized dyes in this study were the azo dyes Acid red 27 and Reactive black 5 and co-
incidently, these had the highest redox potentials. The authors found that the addition of a
mediator, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), enhanced the rate and extent of decolourization
ofalldyes,includingAcidred27andReactiveblack5,andattributedthistothehigherre-
dox potential of laccase/HBT (+1.084 V vs NHE ie normal hydrogen electrode) compared
tolaccasealone(+0.780VvsNHE)(Bourbonnais etal.,1995). Theadditionofmediators
suchashydroxybenzotriazole(HBT)orABTShasbeenshowntoimprovedecolourization
(Reyeset al.,1999; Zille et al.,2004).
Thepresentstudyalsoexaminedthetoxicityofthedyesandtheirenzymaticallydecolour-
ized products. Dyes and auxiliary chemicals used in the dyeing process render textile
wastewaters toxic for activated sludge processes (Odeigah et al., 1995; Rosa et al., 2001;
Wanget al., 2002). Ramsay and Nguyen (2002) have shown that metabolites of T. versi-
colornotassociatedwithdecolourizationcancontributetotoxicity. Thesemetabolitescan
potentially mask the toxic effects of the parent dye and its daughter products (Ramsay and
Nguyen,2002;Shin etal.,2002;Rosa etal.,2001). Hence,puriﬁedenzymesandinorganic
bufferwereusedtoeliminatesuchcontributions,andtoxicitychangeswouldbedueonlyto
decolourized products. Several test organisms such as algae, bacteria, ﬁsh and plants have
been used to assess efﬂuent toxicity (Rosa et al., 2001). When a variety of assays wereCHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 102
compared, V. ﬁscheri (a luminescent bacterium) was the most sensitive, and was consid-
eredthemosteffectiveandpracticalfortheMicrotoxassay(Rosa etal.,2001;Wang etal.,
2002). Microtox results were shownto correlate to toxicity results in higher organisms.
In our study, the azo and indigoid dyes were more toxic than the anthraquinone dyes (Ta-
ble 4.3). However, Novotn ´yet al.(2006) reported that their anthraquinone dyes (Reactive
blue19andDispersedblue3)weremoretoxicthantheirazodyes(Reactiveorange16and
Congo red) when tested with V. ﬁsheri also. Although this appears to be a contradiction,
the number of dyes in either study was low and the only dye common to both studies was
Dispersedblue3. Inourstudy,thetoxicityanalysesweredonewiththedyesintheenzyme
buffer (which had a mild toxic effect) in order to compare them with the decolourized
products. Novotn ´yet al.(2006) did no decolourization studies and had not speciﬁed the
exact composition of their dye solutions. Although Abadulla et al.(2000) evaluated dye
detoxiﬁcationafterdecolourizationby T.hirsuta immobilizedlaccase,theyusedadifferent
toxicityassay with Pseudomonas putida anddid not report the toxicity of the parent dyes.
Abadulla et al.(2000) showed that their azo (Reactive black 5 and Direct blue 71) and
indigoid (Acid blue 74) dyes as well as their anthraquinone (Reactive blue 19 and Acid
blue 225) dyes were detoxiﬁed. Our enzymatic decolourization results are different. Like-
wisetoAbadulla etal.(2000),thedecolourizedproductsoftheazoandindigoiddyeswere
less toxic but those of the anthraquinone dyes were more toxic than the parent dyes. How-
ever, the indigoid dye (Acid blue 74) and one azo dye (Reactive black 5) were common to
both studies with similar detoxiﬁcation results even though different toxicity assays were
performed. However, there were no anthraquinone dyes common to both studies and it is
likelythat V.ﬁsherimaybemoresensitivetoanthraquinonedyesand/ortheirdecolourizedCHAPTER4. DYEDECOLOURIZATIONAND TOXICITY 103
productsthan P.putida. Thisindicatesthatamuchwiderrangeofdyesshouldbeevaluated
withinthesamestudyasthereisnostandardassaycommonlyfollowedintheliteraturefor
dyetoxicity or detoxiﬁcation data to be strictly compared.
In the anaerobic bacterial decolourization of azo dyes, the generation of aromatic amines
results in an increase in toxicity (Delee et al., 1998). However, when followed by an aero-
bic bacterial step, the amines are degraded and the end toxicity is reduced (Gottlieb et al.,
2003). On the other hand, it was shown in this study that T.versicolor laccase can detoxify
azo and indigoid dyes in one step process similarly to Abadulla et al.(2000). The decol-
orizationofagreaternumberofanthraquinonedyesmustbeconductedtoknowifthetox-
icity increase is speciﬁc to the dye class or linked to the sensitivity of the micro-organism
usedin the toxicity assay.

PMMA beads were hydrazinolyzed and the enzyme immobilized on PMMA-hydrazide

reported in the literature on commercial acrylic carriers, the speciﬁc activity was 50 %
lower. However, since the speciﬁc activity of immobilized laccase on PMMA was similar
tothatofCPC-silica-laccaseusedfordyedecolorization,thesimpleimmobilizationproce-

5.2 Introduction
The use of enzymes in wastewater treatment has recently been the subject of intensive
research (Rigo et al., 2008; Leal et al., 2006). Laccases are blue copper oxidases that
have attracted great interest for removing residual dyes in textile wastewaters. These en-
zymes have been shown to efﬁciently decolourize dye solutions and are most efﬁcient to-
ward anthraquinone dyes (Salony et al., 2006; Nyanhongo et al., 2002; Wong and Yu,
1999). Protein immobilization is an economical and effective means of stabilizing and
reusing an enzyme and immobilized laccase reactors have been studied for dye decolour-
izaton. The most common inorganic supports to immobilize laccase are alumina (Zille
et al., 2003), silica (Peralta-Zamora et al., 2003) and porous glass (Rogalski et al., 1999;
Leonowicz et al., 1988). The procedure to immobilize laccase on these supports is to uti-
lize3-aminoporpyltriethoxysilane(APTES)tointroduceaminesatthesurfaceofthebeads
and then cross-link the enzyme to the support using glutaraldehyde (Duran et al., 2002).
However, these materials are brittle and glutaraldehyde reacts with any primary amine on
the enzyme and may lead to its deactivation. More recently, laccase has been immobilized
on commercial acrylic co-polymers beads for dye decolorization (Arica et al., 2009; Ku-
namneni et al., 2008). Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is an acrylic, abundant, and
relatively inexpensive material that is mechanically more resistant and less brittle than sil-
ica or alumina. It is used to fabricate microﬂuidic devices and chromatography packing
material(Brown et al., 2006; Dominick etal., 2003; Fixe et al.,2004).
The polymer at its surface contains ester groups that can be converted to amines which
react with an aldehyde to generate an imine (R 2-C=N-R) (Schiff base), which is unstable
to hydrolysis. Usually, a mild reducing agent like sodium cyanoborohydride or borane
dimethyl amine is used to stabilize the imine bond (Hermanson, 1996). Another option isCHAPTER5. IMMOBILIZATIONOF LACCASEON PMMA 109
toconverttheestergroupsofPMMAtohydrazideswhichreactwithaldehydestoformsta-
ble hydrazones (R 2-CH=N-NH 2) that are resistant to hydrolysis. Furthermore, hydrazides
are more reactive than amines towards aldehydes at neutral pH since they are completely
deprotonated at pH 5 while amines are deprotonated above pH 9 (Jost et al., 1974). Since
laccaseisaglycoprotein,itcanbeimmobilizedthroughitspolysaccharideresiduesthatcan
be converted to aldehydes with a mild oxidant like periodate. These glycosyl residues are
not involved in catalysis and are located away from the active site. Immobilizing laccase
through its glycosydic residues on PMMA has not been reported and could reduce the risk
of deactivation. Moreover, the proposed immobilization procedure is an efﬁcient method
to orient the enzyme active site toward the bulk liquid (Turkov ´a, 1999; Zaborsky, 1976).
This study reports the feasibility of immobilizing Trametes versicolor laccase by using a
mildoxidant to link the glycolosyl residue to hydrazidegroups on modiﬁed PMMA.
5.3 Materials and methods
5.3.1 Chemicals
Altuglas poly(methyl metacrylate) (PMMA) cylindrical pellets (3 mm long with a diame-
ter of 3 mm) were kindly donated by Arkema Canada (Toronto, ON). Trametes versicolor
laccase, Reactive blue 19, sodium periodate, hydrazine hydrate and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada (Oakville, Ontario). Sodium ac-
etate,sodiumsulfate,sodiumphosphateandtheiodo-beads(PierceBiotechnologies)were
purchased from Fisher Scientiﬁc Canada (Ottawa, Ontario). Sodium 125-iodine was pur-
chased from Perkin-Elmer (Waltham, MA, USA) and glutaric acid dialdehyde(glutaralde-
hyde)waspurchased from Acros (Belgium).CHAPTER5. IMMOBILIZATIONOF LACCASEON PMMA 110

Ceramicsand Nanomaterials, Queen’sUniversity(Ontario, Canada).
5.3.3 Hydrazinolysis of PMMA
HydrazinolysisofestersonPMMAwithhydrazineisbasedontheprocedureof(Holmberg
and Hyd´en, 1985). PMMA pellets were rinsed with 50 % propanol in deionized water and
dried under an air stream. The beads were immersed either in a solution of 25 - 30 %
hydrazinemethanol-deionized water(1:1 v/v) at 50±Cfor 24 h.
5.3.4 Enzyme preparation
Fourhundredmilligrams oflyophilysed T.versicolor laccasewasdissolvedin60mlof20
mM NaH 2PO4at pH 7, centrifuged at 10,000 g for 2 hours, and then ﬁltered with a What-
man paper and Millipore ﬁlters (0.45 ¹M). The ﬁltrate containing laccase was dialyzed
against20mMNaH 2PO4pH7for20hoursatadilutionfactorofapproximately5,000and
thereafter passed through a Q-sepharose anion exchange column pre-equilibriated with 20
mM NaH 2PO4at pH 7. Laccase was eluted in one step using 150 mM NaCl and dialyzed
against50 mM NaOAc/50mM NaH 2PO4pH5.CHAPTER5. IMMOBILIZATIONOF LACCASEON PMMA 111

stoppedbyadding75 ¹lofethyleneglycolthendialyzedwithanAmicon20ultraﬁltration
unit using a polyethersulfone membrane with a molecular cutoff of 3500 MW. For the
immobilization, PMMA-hydrazide beads were incubated in a oxidized laccase solution
(2070 ¹g/ml)bufferedwith 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, at 22.0 §1±Cfor 24 h.

water and immersed in a laccase solution with a protein concentration between 20 to 70
¹g/ml.
5.3.7 Freeand immobilized enzyme assay
Laccase activity was measured by monitoring with a spectrophotometer the generation of
2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radicals (ABTS²¡) at 420 nm from
theoxidationofABTS(WolfendenandWillson,1982)at23 §1±CusingaSpectramax250

assay mixture contained 0.2 mM ABTS, 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and the
enzymesample(Bourbonnais etal.,1995). Oneunitoflaccaseactivity(U)wasdeﬁnedas
the amount of enzyme that formed 1 mol ABTS²¡per min. For the immobilized laccaseCHAPTER5. IMMOBILIZATIONOF LACCASEON PMMA 112
system, the PMMA-laccase packed bed reactor (I.D. = 16 mm, l = 55 mm) was connected
to a reservoir containing 100 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate/50 mM KH 2PO4(pH 5) via a
peristaltic pump. The solution was 100 % re-circulated between the packed bed and the
reservoir at a ﬂow rate of 75 ml/min. To determine the immobilized laccase activity, the
variation of the concentration of ABTS²¡in the reservoir with time was measured for a 6
or10 minute intervalduring which the variationwaslinear.

Theiodinatedlaccasesolutionwasseparatedfromtheunreactediodineusingapre-packed
Sephadex G-25 column (gel ﬁltration) and one-ml fractions were collected. The fractions
were quantiﬁed using a 1275 Minigamma gamma counter (LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland).
Laccase was quantiﬁed by monitoring the counts per minutes of 125I-laccase on 0.65 g
of beads in 15-ml plastic test tubes. The counts were corrected with the count efﬁciency
(˜96 %) and converted to the mass of laccase using the speciﬁc radio-activity. The mass
of laccase immobilized was also determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm when laccase
was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. The readings were corrected for Raleigh scattering
at320 nm according to the followingformula:

The coefﬁcient of absorption for laccase was ²280=1.074 ml/mg and was determined
by the ProtoParam program (protein parameter predictor) from the ExPASy website http:CHAPTER5. IMMOBILIZATIONOF LACCASEON PMMA 113

5.3.9 Dependence of immobilized laccase mass on the initial enzyme
concentration
A 1:10 ratio of radio-labeled to non-labeled laccase was modiﬁed by periodate oxidation
then immobilized on PMMA-hydrazide beads according to the method described previ-
ously. A calibration curve with ﬁve initial laccase concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200 and
400¹g/ml) was used to determine the amount of immobilized laccase by relating laccase
concentrationwith cpm.

of laccase that can be immobilized, assuming an effective molecular radius of 4 nm, is

5.4.2 Effect of initial enzyme concentration, temperature and pH on
thespeciﬁc activityof immobilized laccase
The speciﬁc activity was calculated by dividing the measured activity of immobilized lac-
case by its estimated mass. The initial speciﬁc activity of the free enzyme varied between
50 and 80 U/mg (data not shown). The highest immobilized laccase activity on PMMA
was achieved at 23±C and increasing the pH of immobilization from 5 to 7 did not sta-
tistically affect the speciﬁc activity. The speciﬁc activity of immobilized laccase was 110
times higher when the enzyme was immobilized through its polysaccharide chains than
when glutaraldehydecross-linkedthe enzyme to PMMA(Table5.1).CHAPTER5. IMMOBILIZATIONOF LACCASEON PMMA 115

5.5 Discussion
Thegoalofthisstudywastoassessthefeasibilityofimmobilizing Trametesversicolor lac-
case on PMMA, a relatively inexpensive material, instead of using more expensive com-
mercial protein supports. This was successfully accomplished with both immobilization
protocols, i.e., the commonly used glutaraldehyde cross-linking and the milder periodate
oxidation. However, using the milder periodate oxidation resulted in higher speciﬁc activ-
ities suggesting that immobilizing laccase through its sugar residues which are away from
the active site is a better strategy for preserving enzyme activity. This may have reduced
the risk of deactivating the active site while glutaraldehyde can react with any primaryCHAPTER5. IMMOBILIZATIONOF LACCASEON PMMA 116
amine group and lead to enzyme deactivation. The higher quantity of immobilized lac-
case when cross-linked with glutaraldehyde suggests that multiple layers of laccase were
formed. However, due to diffusion limitations, enzymes in the lower layers could be less
active.
ThemassofproteinimmobilizedonPMMAachievedinthisstudycompareswellwith

(Aricaet al., 2009). While the nature of the acrylic monomers of Dilbeads and Sepabeads
wasnotreported,acrylicpolymersusedforenzymeimmobilizationgenerallypossesssub-
stantial hydrophilicity to favor good enzyme activity retention (Epton et al., 1976; Novick
and Dordick, 2000). PMMA may not be as hydrophilic has the Dilbead and Sepabead
polymers and this difference may explain the lower laccase speciﬁc activity in this inves-
tigation. Moreover, (Arica et al., 2009) used spacer arms to retain good enzyme activity.
Toincreasethetotalimmobilizedlaccaseactivity,porousbeadscanbeusedtoincreasethe

carrier to minimize interactions. Nonetheless, the results suggest that PMMA is a suitable
support for laccase and can be used for dye decolourization since its speciﬁc activity was
comparableto that achievedwith CPC-silica beads.
There are no reports on the effect of the immobilization temperature on the activity
of immobilized laccase. Although Bahar and Celebi (1999) demonstrated that increasing
the immobilization temperature of a glucoamylase from 20 to 40±C did not affect its im-
mobilized activity, in this study, the highest speciﬁc activity of immobilized laccase was
obtainedroomtemperature. Theresultsinthisstudyindicatethatimmobilizingtheenzyme
at5 or 23±C does not affectgreatly the activityof the enzyme.

Reactiveblue 19
6.1 Abstract
Laccase is a multi-copper oxidase that can decolorize textile dyes and there is increasing
interestinitsusetotreattextilewastewaterswhichalsocontainauxiliarychemicalssuchas
surfactants and salts. This investigation examines the effect of Merpol, a non-ionic surfac-
tant,onthedecolorizationofReactiveblue19,ananthraquinonedye,andontheoxidation
of 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) by Trametes versicolor
laccase. The results show that the surfactant had little effect on the enzyme or on ABTS
oxidation which followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, Reactive blue 19 decol-
orization was inhibited with increasing Merpol concentration. Spectroscopic analysis of
122CHAPTER6. DECOLOURIZATIONINHIBITION BY SUBSTRATEDEPLETION 123
the dye with Merpol and analysis of the kinetic data show that decolorization rates de-
pended on an interaction between the dye and the surfactant. The proposed inhibition by
a substrate depletion model in which the dye concentration decreases as a dye molecule
binds to a surfactant molecule and/or is sequestered into micelles ﬁts the data suitably and
the model was validated by estimating the inhibition constant from independent saturation
equilibrium binding assays. This study is the ﬁrst to investigate the kinetic effect of a sur-
factant on the enzymatic dye decolorization and to show the depleting effect of Merpol on
Reactiveblue 19.
6.2 Introduction
Enzymes may be used to effectively remove low concentration pollutants in wastewaters
(Karam and Nicell, 1997). The lignin-degrading enzyme laccase has attracted signiﬁcant
interest for treating textile waste efﬂuents and its ability to decolorize dyes (reviewed in
Husain (2006)). It is copper oxidase that efﬁciently degrades anthraquinone dyes and dyes
with phenolic moieties (Young and Yu, 1997; Nyanhongo et al., 2002; Champagne and
Ramsay, 2005). Unlike lignin or manganese peroxidase, laccase requires only molecular
oxygenasaco-substrateandmaybemoresuitablebiocatalystsforindustrialandbioreme-
diationapplications. Laccasecandegradephenoliccompoundsinwinedistillerywastewa-
ter(StrongandBurgess,2008),estrogensinmunicipalwastewater(Auriol etal.,2007)and
textile dyes in textile wastewaters (Reyes et al., 1999). In the latter investigation, immo-
bilizedCoriolopsis gallica laccase decolorized 10 batches of an industrial waste efﬂuent
containingDirectBlue200,DirectRed80andDirectBlack22. Theremovalefﬁciencyde-
creasedwithincreasingdecolorizationbatchesandtheauthorscouldnotidentifythecause
of the enzyme deactivation. Although a few studies have used laccase to decolorize indus-
trial textile waste efﬂuents, there is no kinetic investigation of the effects of the efﬂuentCHAPTER6. DECOLOURIZATIONINHIBITION BY SUBSTRATEDEPLETION 124

Harazono and Nakamura (2005) showed that MnP from Phanerochaete sordida required
Tween 80, a non-ionic surfactant, to decolorize a mixture of reactive dyes (Reactive black
5,Reactivered120,Reactivegreen5andReactiveorange14)butwasinhibitedbyanother
surfactant, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The authors thought that inhibition occurred because
PVA interrupted the lipid peroxidation which generates reactive radicals. Abadulla et al.
(2000) reported that Univadine PA (anionic surfactant), Tinegal MR (cationic surfactant)
and Albegal FFA (wetting agent) inhibited 2,6-dimethoxyphenol oxidation by Trametes
hirsutalaccase by 17.9 %, 5.2 % and 2.3 % respectively but the effects on dye decoloriza-
tion were not examined. Moreover, there are no studies which have examined the effect of
surfactantson decolorization kinetics by laccase.
Merpol is a non-ionic, polyethylene oxide surfactant used as a wetting and emulsify-
ing agent to achieve better fabric permeation that allows an even dyeing of textile fabrics.
There is no report on the effects of a non-ionic surfactant like Merpol on dye decoloriza-
tion or decolorization kinetics. Since such a surfactant could be in the dye efﬂuent, it is
useful to know whether it affects the enzymatic decolorization. This investigation there-

Four hundred milligrams of lyophilized Trametes versicolor laccase was dissolved in 60
ml of 20 mM NaH 2PO4at pH 7, centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 2 hours, and then ﬁltered
withaWhatmanpaperandMilliporeﬁlters(0.45 ¹M).Theﬁltratewasdialyzedagainst20
mM NaH 2PO4pH 7 for 20 hours at a dilution factor of approximately 5,000 then passed
through a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM NaH 2PO4at
pH7. Laccasewaselutedinonestepusing150mMNaCl. Theeluatewasdialyzedagainst

6.3.4 Dyeconcentration and spectroscopicanalysis
The concentration of Reactive blue 19 was measured with a Unicam UV1 spectropho-
tometer (Spectronic Unicam, Cambridge, UK) or Spectramax 250 plate reader at the dyes

Initialdyedecolorizationratesweremeasuredinthepresenceof0,0.773,1.55,2.58or3.09

path length of absorbance in the well for this volume was 0.5 cm. The assay mixture had
a ﬁnal concentration of 0.274 nM laccase with ABTS and 120 nM with Reactive blue 19.
For steady-state kinetic analysis, initial rates were similarly determined for 0 to 400 ¹M
Reactive blue 19 and for 0 to 1000 ¹M ABTS. The reaction was initiated by adding the
enzyme aliquot to the assay mixture. Time course curves of 61 absorbance points wereCHAPTER6. DECOLOURIZATIONINHIBITION BY SUBSTRATEDEPLETION 129

SOFTmax Pro (Molecular Devices) by calculating the tangent slope to the ﬁrst ﬁve to ten

experiments were done in triplicate and the results shown are averages with the error bars
representingthe standard error.

ABTS oxidation by laccase followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics at all Merpol concen-

Spectroscopic analysis of Reactive blue 19 without Merpol or laccase showed a maximum

Merpol addition (Figure 6.4A and B) and Merpol alone did not absorb in the visible range
(Figure6.4C).

Thedye-Merpolcomplexwasmonitoredspectrophotometricallyat630nm. Theabsorbance
at 630 nm shown in Figure 6.5 corresponding to the complex was calculated by subtract-
ingtheabsorbanceofthedyeatthatwavelengthfromtheabsorbanceofthedye-surfactant

concentration and tended to plateau at high concentrations. The derivation of the model
ﬁttedthrough the points is presented in the nextsection.

6.4.6 KineticmodelingoftheeffectofMerpolonthedecolorizationof
Reactiveblue 19 by laccase
Without Merpol, the Reactive blue 19 decolorization also followed Michaelis-Menten ki-
netics (Figure 6.6 ) but as the Merpol concentration increased, the initial rates decreased
and decolorization kinetics became increasingly sigmodal. The dependence of initial rates
on initial dye concentrations in the presence of Merpol did not follow Michaelis-Menten
kinetics. Hence,amodiﬁedrateequationishypothesizedwheretheinhibitor(M,i.e. Mer-
pol) binds to the free substrate (S, i.e. Reactive blue 19) but not the enzyme (E, laccase)
(Figure 6.7).
Furthermore, the enzyme can convert the free dye only to decolorized products (P) as
the dye bound by Merpol is unavailable for decolorization. Since the total dye concentra-
tion added to the reaction mixture, [S]T, is the sum of the free dye [S], the enzyme-dye
complex [ES]andthe dye-Merpol complex [SM]concentrations, [S]can be expressedasCHAPTER6. DECOLOURIZATIONINHIBITION BY SUBSTRATEDEPLETION 136

6.5 Discussion
TheresultsinthisstudyshowthatMerpolhadlittleeffectonlaccasebutaffectedthedecol-
orizationofReactiveblue19. SinceMerpolslightlyincreasedtheABTSoxidationrate(Ta-
ble 6.1), the surfactant may have a stabilizing and/or inducing effect on laccase for ABTS.
Bastoet al.(2007) also showed improved laccase stability in the presence of polyvinyl
alcohol in the ultrasonic decolorization of Indigo carmine. However, when Reactive blue
19 was the substrate, Merpol clearly inhibited its decolorization. Although Abadulla et al.
(2000) did not examine the effect of surfactants on enzymatic dye decolorization, they
found that Univadine PA (anionic surfactant), Tinegal MR (cationic surfactant) and Albe-
gal FFA (wetting agent) inhibited the oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol by laccase. The
inhibition was less severe than that obtained with Reactive blue 19 in the present study.
Their highest inhibition of 17.9 % was obtained with 2 g/l Univadine PA while with 2 g/l
Merpol,Reactiveblue 19 decolorization wasinhibited by approximately 50 %.
MerpolmayhavehadaslightenhancingeffectontheABTSoxidationbutitdidchange
the kinetics of the reaction. Since Merpol had little effect on the enzymatic oxidation of
ABTSbutsigniﬁcantlyinhibitedtheenzymaticdecolorizationofReactiveblue19,thesur-
factant must have interacted with the dye. This interaction was detected in the absorbance
spectralscanbytheappearanceofasecondpeakofat630nm(Figure6.5B)thatcorrespond
to the absorption of the dye-Merpol complex. This wavelength shift was not observed for
ABTS. It is also clear that Merpol is not responsible for the second peak since it did not
absorbin the visible range.
A model of inhibition by substrate depletion where the dye molecules bind to Merpol
moleculestoreducetheamountoffreedyeavailabletoreactwithlaccasedescribesthede-
colorization kinetics. This model is in good agreement with the experimental data as seenCHAPTER6. DECOLOURIZATIONINHIBITION BY SUBSTRATEDEPLETION 141
in Figure 6.6A and the residual plot also shows no bias (Figure 6.6B). In addition, the ki-
neticmechanismissupportedbysaturationequilibriumbindingdatathatclearlyshowsthat
MerpolbindsReactiveblue19. ThedifferencebetweentheKdestimatedfromtheequilib-
rium binding experiment and the from the kinetic model are not statistically signiﬁcant ( ®
=0.05).
The dye may have interacted with the surfactant molecules or with the micelles as all
Merpol concentrations were above the critical micelle concentration of 0.5 g/l. It is not
clear why the surfactant interacted with the dye but not with ABTS. Although Reactive
blue 19 most likely bears a net negative charge at pH 5, the hydrophobic interactions with
Merpol may be dominant. This may partially explain our results as Tokuda et al.(1999)
hasshownthatbothelectrostaticandhydrophobicinteractionsaffecteddecolorizationrates
byperoxide bleaching agents in the presence of surfactantmolecules.
The proposed inhibition model may also explain the results of Hu et al.(2007) where
Tween 80 signiﬁcantly inhibited the oxidation of benzo[ k]ﬂuoranthene (BaP) by laccase
immobilized on kaolinite. Tween 80 was used to increase the solubility of BaP in order
to increase its availability to the enzyme. However, as the apparent solubility increased,
BaPmoleculeswereprobablyentrappedinsidethemicelleswhichthenpresentedabarrier
betweenBaP and the immobilized laccase and resulted in an apparent inhibition.
This is the ﬁrst study to show that enzymatic decolorization can be affected by the
interactionbetweenadyeandasurfactant. Thisissigniﬁcantsincesurfactantsarecommon
in dye efﬂuents and can affect not only biological decolorization (whether enzymatic or
withafungalculture)butalsophysicalorchemicaldecolorizationprocesses(Tokuda etal.,
1999). Theefﬁciencyoftheprocesswillmostlikelydiminishwiththedegreeofinteraction
between the dye and the surfactant and the quantity of the surfactant. This impact would
be even greater at low dye concentrations which are typical of most dye efﬂuents. Thus
it is important to better understand the nature of these interactions, not only to predictCHAPTER6. DECOLOURIZATIONINHIBITION BY SUBSTRATEDEPLETION 142
decolorizationbutalso to determine howthese interactions can be minimized.
Conclusions
We have examined the effect of a non-ionic surfactant, Merpol, on the enzymatic oxida-
tion of ABTS and decolorization of Reactive blue 19 using laccase. The surfactant has no
signiﬁcant effects on the enzyme itself as it has no effect on ABTS oxidation. Although
Merpol had little effect on ABTS oxidation, Reactive blue 19 decolorization was inhib-
ited with increasing surfactant concentration. Spectral scans of the dye with and without

Reactiveblue 19
7.1 Abstract
Laccases are phenol-oxidases produced by white rot fungi and their potential application
for the decolourization of textile wastewaters has been the object of intensive research.
Textile wastewaters contain salts like sodium chloride and sodium sulphate, and their pH
mayvarybetween3and12. Asthesefactorsmayaffectenzymeactivity,theeffectsofpH,

tionofReactiveblue19,amodelanthraquinonedye,andtheoxidationof2,2-Azino-bis(3-
ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), the reference substrate, were evaluated by
steady-state kinetic analysis. The results showed that increasing the pH decreased the rate
of ABTS oxidation whereas the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 was optimal at pH

4. While sodium sulphate did not affect laccase activity, sodium chloride inhibited both
ABTS oxidation and dye decolourization. However, the type of inhibition was substrate
dependent. With ABTS, the inhibition was hyperbolic non-competitive and was parabolic
mixed with Reactive blue 19. Furthermore, the results suggested that two chlorides may
bindtolaccaseinthepresenceofthedye. Thisinvestigationistheﬁrsttoproposeamodel
oflaccase inhibition in which the type of inhibition by chloride depends on the substrate.
7.2 Introduction
Laccases are copper oxidases produced by white rot fungi that can degrade a wide range
of organic pollutants including textile dyes, and have attracted great interest for their po-
tential application in bioremediation and textile wastewater treatment (Torres et al., 2003;
Baldrian,2006). Theseenzymesdecolourizeanthraquinonedyesefﬁcientlyandtheirspeci-
ﬁcitycanbebroadenedtootherclassesofdyesbyusingsmallmolecularweightmediators
such as hydroxybenzotriazole (Reyes et al., 1999; Peralta-Zamora et al., 2003; Trovaslet
et al., 2007; Murugesan et al., 2007). Fungal laccases contain four coppers organized into
twocopperclusters. Thetype1copperislocatedneartheactivesiteandreceivestheelec-
trons extracted from the substrate(s). The electrons are then transferred to the two type 3
coppers, which relay the electrons to type 2 copper where oxygen is reduced to water. The
type2andtype3coppersarearrangedinatriangleandformthetri-nuclearclusterlocated

Textilewastewaterscontainsulphateandchloridesaltsthatvaryfrom930to3460mg/l
and 400 to 16,000 mg/l respectively (Orhon et al., 2001; Vishnu et al., 2008). Their pH
may vary from 3 to 12 depending on the dyeing process used (Rutherford et al., 2003;

Ettinger (1988) demonstrated that ﬂuoride partially inhibits Rhus vernucifora laccase by
binding to type 2 copper. On the other hand, Vaz-Dominguez et al.(2008) showed that
Trametes hirsuta laccase activity was completely suppressed by ﬂuoride and partially by
chloride. Hydroxideanionsalsobindtotype2copperandpreventthebindingofoxygenat

of these effects would be useful for the design of an enzymatic treatment. Therefore, this
investigation will analyse the effects of pH, sodium chloride, and sodium sulphate on the
kinetic behaviour of Trametes versicolor laccase during the oxidation of ABTS and the
decolourizationof Reactiveblue 19 a model anthraquinone dye.

7.3.2 Enzyme preparation
Four hundred milligrams of lyophilised T.versicolor laccase was dissolved in 60 ml of 20
mM NaH 2PO4at pH 7, centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 2 hours and thereafter ﬁltered with
a Whatman paper and Millipore ﬁlters (0.45 ¹M). The ﬁltrate was dialyzed against 20
mM NaH 2PO4pH 7 for 20 hours at a dilution factor of approximately 5,000 then passed
through a Q-sepharose anion exchange column pre-equilibriated with 20 mM NaH 2PO4at
pH7. Laccasewaselutedinonestepusing150mMNaCl. Theeluatewasdialyzedagainst
50mM NaOAc/50mM NaH 2PO4pH 5.
7.3.3 Laccase assay
The activity of laccase was determined by monitoring spectrophotometrically the genera-
tion of 2,2-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radicals (ABTS²) at 420 nm
fromtheoxidationofABTS(WolfendenandWilson,1982)at23 §1±CusingaSpectramax
250 plate reader (with the SOFTmax PRO software package (Molecular Devices, Sunny-
valeCA,USA)).Theassaymixturecontained500 ¹MABTS,and100mMsodiumacetate
buffer (pH 5.0) for total reaction mixture of 180 ¹l. The path length of absorbance in the
well for this volume was 0.5 cm. The rate of reaction was expressed in ¹M/min or in units
oflaccase.
7.3.4 Proteinassay
The protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm and corrected for
Raleighscattering with readings at 320 nm according to the followingformula
Acorr

280¶4
(7.1)CHAPTER7. EFFECTS OF PH AND SALTSON DYEDECOLOURIZATION 149
The coefﬁcient of absorption for laccase ( ²280=1.074 ml/mg) was determined by the
ProtoParamprogram (protein parameter predictor) from the ExPASywebsite
(http:==ca:expasy:org=tools=protparam:html ).
7.3.5 Dyeconcentration and decolorization assay
TheReactiveblue 19 concentrationwasdeterminedspectrophotometrically bymonitoring
the absorbance at 592 nm. The decolorization activity was calculated by dividing the rate
of absorbance change by the coefﬁcient of absorption of 10,044 M¡1cm¡1(determined
from a calibration curve from 0 to 45.7 ¹M). The rate of decolorization was expressed in
¹M/min.
7.3.6 Initialrate analysis (steady-state kinetics)
TheeffectsofpH,sodiumchlorideandsodiumsulphateonthefreelaccasewerequantiﬁed
by initial rate analysis with ABTS, as the reference substrate, and Reactive blue 19. The
assay mixture was buffered with 50 mM NaOAc/50 mM KH 2PO4and included 0.274 nM
laccase with ABTS or 120 nM laccase with Reactive blue 19. All assays were conducted
in96-wellplates(300 ¹lperwell). Eachwellcontained108 ¹lofbuffer,36 ¹lofsubstrate
(in the same buffer), and 36 ¹l of laccase solution for total reaction mixture of 180 ¹l.
The path length of absorbance in the well for this volume was 0.5 cm. The initial ABTS
concentrations (unless stated otherwise) were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 ¹M and the initial dye concentrations were 10, 20, 30, 40,
50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 ¹M. Time course curves of 61 absorbance
points were generated over 30 minutes and the initial rate was determined by the software
package of the plate reader, SOFTmax Pro (Molecular Devices) by calculating the tangent
slope to the ﬁrst ﬁve points (see Appendix D.2 for a sample calculation). The initial ratesCHAPTER7. EFFECTS OF PH AND SALTSON DYEDECOLOURIZATION 150
were measured in triplicate at 22 §1±C and the results shown are averages with the error
barsrepresenting the standard error.
7.3.7 Effect of pH and salts
Laccase steady-state kinetics with ABTS and Reactive blue 19 were performed at pH 3, 4,
5, 6 and 7 in a 50 mM NaOAc/50 mM KH 2PO4buffer and the pH was adjusted with a 6
M H 2SO4. For the impact of salts on laccase kinetics, analyses with both substrates were
conducted in the presence of 50, 100, 150 or 200 mM sodium chloride and 7, 28, 49 or 70
mM sodium sulphate. The initial ABTS concentrations in the sodium chloride experiment
were 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 600 ¹M. All assays
werebufferedwith 50 mM NaOAc/50mM KH 2PO4atpH 5.
7.3.8 Data analysis
The Michaelis-Menten model was used to ﬁt the experimental pH and sodium sulfate data
whereas modiﬁed rate equations were derived to analyze the effects of sodium chloride.
Kinetic parameters and inhibition constants were determined by nonlinear least square re-
gression(ThesumsofsquareswasminimizedwiththeGauss-Newtonalgorithmwithequal

puting,CRAN) and Systat (Systat Software,Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).CHAPTER7. EFFECTS OF PH AND SALTSON DYEDECOLOURIZATION 151

7.5 Discussion
A small number of investigations have reported on the effects of pH on dye decolorization
by laccase. Nyanhongo et al.(2002) showed that the optimum pH of the Reactive blue 19
decolourizationby Trametesmodesta laccasewas4.5whereasMurugesan etal.(2007)re-
ported an optimal pH of 4 for the decolourization of the same dye by Ganoderma lucidum

atpH 4.
TheredoxpotentialoflaccaseisindependentofpHandthatofasubstratewilldecrease
with increasing pH if a proton is generated from the reaction (Xu, 1997). The rate of
a laccase-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the difference between type 1 copper and
the substrate redox potentials (Xu, 1997). Therefore, any variation in the rate is due to a
change in the substrate potential. Koudelka et al.(1985) showed that enzyme inhibition at
alkaline pH was caused by hydroxide anions that bind to type 2 copper where oxygen is
reduced to water. Madzak et al.(2006) conﬁrmed that the only charged residue, aspartate
206 (negative carboxyl), in the active site of laccase weakly contributed to the pH proﬁle.
The redox potential of ABTS is independent of pH since its oxidation does not involve
the release of a proton (Xu, 1997). Hence, the gradual inhibition of the enzyme with
increasing pH was mainly due to an increasing hydroxide concentration, which caused
a strictly declining activity as a function of pH. On the other hand, the decolourization

have generated the ascending part of the curve and as the pH was further increased, the
hydroxideinhibition became dominant and caused the curveto decline.
Few studies have examined the effect of reaction conditions on the kinetics of laccase
dye decolourization. Trovaslet et al.(2007) showed that sodium chloride and sodium sul-
fate inhibited the decolourization of Acid blue 62 by Pycnoporus sanguineus laccase but
no kinetic analysis was conducted. In this present study, sodium sulphate affected neither
ABTSoxidationnorthedecolourizationofReactiveblue19(Figure7.2AB).Therateofa

gen is neutral, any observed effects on the rate would be due to alterations to the enzyme.
Therefore,sodium sulphate or the ionic strength does not affect T.versicolor laccase.CHAPTER7. EFFECTS OF PH AND SALTSON DYEDECOLOURIZATION 164
Sincetheionicstrengthdidnotaffectlaccase,itwasclearlyinhibitedbychloride. Naki
andVorfolomeev(1981)demonstrated that chloride isa competitiveinhibitor with various
electron donors as substrates whereas in this study, the inhibition of ABTS oxidation by T.

ingKS;appindicates that chloride decreased the enzyme afﬁnity for ABTS and the inhibi-
tion can be considered partial competitive also (Figure A). The apparent turnover k cat;app
decreases because chloride decrease the concentration of fully free active enzyme. Since
the enzyme-subtrate-inhibitor complex is not as efﬁcient as the enzyme-subtrate complex
to generate the product, the maximum rate of reaction decreases. Vaz-Dominguez et al.
(2008) showed that chloride is not likely to penetrate the channel leading to type 2 cop-
per because of its size and is not likely to inhibit the reduction of oxygen. Therefore, the
decreased k cat;appmay also reﬂect the ability of chloride to suppress the electron transfer
from the substrate to type 1 copper, or from type 1 copper to type 3 copper. On the other
hand, the inhibition was parabolic mixed when Reactive blue 19 was the substrate (Figure
7.4B-D). Parabolic inhibition occurs when two inhibitor binding sites exist on an enzyme.
Akineticmechanisminwhichchloridecanbindtotwositeswithequalafﬁnity(i.e.,equal
KI)wasderived. Itwasalsoassumedthattheproductcanbegeneratedwhenonechloride
is bound to laccase, as it is the case in ABTS oxidation, while no product is generated
when 2 chlorides are bound to the enzyme (Figure 7.6). It is not clear why parabolic inhi-
bition occurs in dye decolourization but not in ABTS oxidation. As previouslymentioned,
chloride inhibits laccase by binding to the active site. The ®value of 0.743 signiﬁes that

lower afﬁnity for chloride. The halide, less tightly bound, would then be less efﬁcient atCHAPTER7. EFFECTS OF PH AND SALTSON DYEDECOLOURIZATION 165

ThiscouldinturnexplainthelargervalueofReactiveblue19decoluorization(0.274)than
that of ABTS (0.0778). As mentioned, the parameter ¯is the effectiveness of enzyme to
generate a product when bound by one chloride. The binding of two chlorides however,
would completely inhibit the enzyme, i.e., completely interrupt the electron transfer from
the substrate to the tri-nuclear cluster. To summarize, a halide like ﬂuoride completely in-
hibitsTrameteshirsuta laccase(Vaz-Dominguez etal.,2008)byblockingelectrontransfer
at the active site near T1 copper and at the T2 copper through a channel. Since it is not
likely that chloride can penetrate the channel leading to type 2 copper because of its larger
size, it is proposed that the binding of two chlorides to laccase favoured by Reactive blue
19 completely inhibits the enzyme. This is the ﬁrst report to the best of our knowledge
whichproposes a mechanism for the complete inhibition of laccase by chloride.
7.6 Conclusions
ThisinvestigationhasanalyzedtheimpactofpH,sodiumchlorideandsodiumsulphateon
dye decolorization. Alkaline pHs inhibited both the oxidation of ABTS and the Reactive
blue 19 decolorization. The Reactive blue 19 decolorization is optimal at 4 and the pH
proﬁle suggests that a proton is released from dye decolorization. Ionic strength did not
affect ABTS oxidation or dye decolorization. The effects of sodium chloride on laccase
kineticsofoxidationofABTSandonthedecolorizationofReactiveblue19werequantiﬁed
andthetypeoflaccaseinhibitionbychloridedependedonthesubstrate. Forbothreactions,
the exposure of laccase to the halide showed non-linear inhibitions. A hyperbolic partial
non-competitive inhibition was observed when ABTS was the substrate while a parabolic
mixed-type inhibition was occurred with Reactive blue 19. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate that proposes a mechanism by which chloride canCHAPTER7. EFFECTS OF PH AND SALTSON DYEDECOLOURIZATION 166
completely inhibit laccase. The proposed models can be used to estimated the size of an
eventualenzyme reactor for design of an enzyme treatment.Bibliography

Conclusions
1. ThedecolourizationofReactiveblue19bylaccaseimmobilizedonCPC-silicabeads
was mainly enzymatic although dye adsorption occurred. Dye adsorption was re-
duced by treating CPC- silica-laccase beads with ethanolamine which blocks the
unreactedaldehydegroups after laccase immobilization
2. Immobilizing laccase on silica beads change its pH activity proﬁle for oxidizing
ABTS oxidation but did not affect that for decolourizing Reactive blue 19. Fur-
thermore,thedyespeciﬁcityoftheenzymewasnotaffectedbyimmobilizationsince
it was similar for immobilized and free laccase. Azo dyes were the least efﬁciently
decolourizedmost likelybecause of their high redox potentials.
3. The toxicity of the parent dyes and their degradation product(s) varied with the dye.
Afteralaccasetreatment,Indigoidandazodyeweredetoxiﬁedwhereasthedecolour-
izationof the anthraquinone dyes led to an increased toxicity.
4. Merpol inhibited the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 by T.versicolor laccase by
substrate depletion. A Michaelis-Menten like model in which Merpol binds the dye
169CHAPTER8. CONCLUSIONS 170
was derived. The proposed kinetic mechanism of inhibition is supported by statis-
tically similar Merpol-dye dissociation constants estimated by steady-state kinetics
and by saturation equilibrium binding.
5. Increasing pH inhibited the laccase ABTS oxidation while the optimum pH of Re-
active blue 19 decolourization was 4. While sodium sulfate did not affect laccase,
sodium chloride inhibited laccase ABTS oxidation and dye decolourization. When
ABTSwasthesubstrate,theinhibitionwashyperbolicnon-competitiveandfromthe
rate model, it was suggested that one chloride anion was bound to the enzyme. With
Reactiveblue19,theparabolicmixedinhibitionsuggestedthattwochloridesbindto

afﬁnity of the enzyme for chloride enough to favour the binding of a second anion
wasderived.
6.T.versicolor laccasewasimmobilizedthroughitspolysaccharideresiduesonPMMA
and the enzyme load compared well with commercial protein supports. Immobiliz-
ing laccase through its sugar residues favoured higher speciﬁc immobilized enzyme
activity than using glutaraldehyde cross-linking. The speciﬁc activity of laccase on
PMMA was higher than that achieved on the CPC-silica beads and suggests that
PMMA is suitable support for dye decolourization.Chapter 9
Contributions
9.1 Decolourization of Reactive blue 19 by laccase immo-
bilized on CPC-silica beads
In the analysis of the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 by immobilized laccase, dye re-
movalwasmainlyenzymatic. Itwaspossibletoreducedyeadsorptionbytreatingthebeads
withethanolaminetoblockthealdehydegroupsnotoccupiedbylaccase. Withotherdyes,
it was also discovered that signiﬁcant dye adsorption occurred when the enzyme was inef-
ﬁcient at decolorizing the dyes. These ﬁndings contributed to understanding some of the
possible reasons why dye adsorption occurred during decolourization by an immobilized
enzyme.

convenient method that can be used without an elaborate experimental setup or the use of
moreexpensivecommercial protein supports.
9.3 Effect of Merpol on the decolourization of Reactive
blue19 by laccase
Since Merpol is a surfactant used as a wetting agent and detergent in the dyeing process,
it was relevant to analyze its impact on dye decolourization by laccase. Merpol, a non-
ionic surfactant, inhibited the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 by substrate depletion;
by spectroscopic analysis, it was demonstrated that the dye interacted with the surfactant
andthebindingquantiﬁed. Aratemodelwasdevelopedtodescribethekineticmechanism.
ThemaincontributionofthisinvestigationisthatitistheﬁrsttoreportonMerpolinhibition
of laccase decolourization of Reactive blue 19 and to elucidate the kinetic mechanism of
inhibition. Moreover, the kinetic model was supported by a qualitative (spectroscopy) and
quantitative(equilibriumbinding)analysesoftheinteractionbetweenReactiveblue19and
Merpol. The model developed can be used to estimate the size of a laccase reactor for the
treatmentof texitlewastewaters.
9.4 Effect of Sodium chloride and ionic strength on the
decolourizationof Reactiveblue 19 by laccase
It was shown that laccase was not affected by ionic strength and that chloride inhibited its
decolourization of Reactive blue 19. As previously shown, when ABTS was the substrate,
the inhibition was hyperbolic non-competitive whereas when Reactive blue 19 was the
substrate, the inhibition was parabolic mixed. The main contribution of this section isCHAPTER9. CONTRIBUTIONS 173
that this is the ﬁrst investigation to demonstrate that the mechanism of chloride inhibition
depended on the substrate and an appropriate kinetic model was proposed. The kinetics
models developed can be used to estimate the size of a laccase reactor for the treatment of
textilewastewaters.Chapter 10

zymesupport on enzymatic dyedecolourization
SincethespeciﬁcactivitiesofimmobilizedlaccaseonsilicaandPMMAbeadsdifferedand

laccase immobilization should be investigated to determine if the activity retention can be
improved without the use of commercial supports. The activity of laccase immobilized on
support with increasing hydrophilicity should be analyzed. (e.g. poly(ethylene-co-butyl
methaacrylate), PMMA, polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate ).
174CHAPTER10. RECOMMENDATIONS 175
10.2 Immobilization of laccase on porousPMMA beads
Laccase was successfully immobilized on PMMA beads and the retained laccase activity
was higher than on silica beads. To increase the mass of enzyme immobilized, laccase
should be immobilized on porous PMMA beads and the preparation tested for dye de-
colourization.
10.3 Characterize laccase kinetic in real textile wastewa-
ters
The effects of individual auxiliary chemicals on dye decolourization were analyzed in a
synthetic buffer to understand their impact on the decolourization mechanism. However,
the combined effect(s) of these components in a textile wastewater may be different. It is
recommended that the kinetic behaviour of the enzyme in an actual wastewater be charac-
terized to understand how all the components together impact enzymatic decolourization.
Comparinglaccasekineticsinbufferandinwastewatermayhelptoidentifyotherinhibitors
andknowledgeofitsbehaviourovertimewillallowustodevelopbetterstrategiestomain-
tain long term enzyme stability. Furthermore, the assessment of the enzyme’s stability in
wastewater must be conducted before the steady-state kinetic studies in a wastewater sam-
ples. Once a kinetic rate and enzyme deactivation model are obtained, an enzyme reactor
canbe sized and tested for the decolourization of an industrial textilewastewater.CHAPTER10. RECOMMENDATIONS 176

salts on the binding of Reactive blue 19 to Merpol may allow us to develop strategies to

textiledyes will bind to Merpol in a similar manner.AppendixA

The p-value for tcalculated= 0.544 is 0.294 for a 1 sided-test. The value of ttabulated
with a p-value of 0.294, a signiﬁcance level ®=0.05, and a degree of freedom of 99 is
1.055. Since tcalculated < ttabulated, the null hypothesis is rejected. The Kdvalues are not

B.2 Derivationoftherateequationfortheparabolicmixed
inhibition
Parabolic inhibition occurs when more than one inhibitor binding site exist and is usu-
ally complete, i.e. no product can be generate by the enzyme when all inhibitor sites are
occupiedby the inhibitor. Consider thefollowingparabolic inhibition kinetic scheme
where the inhibitor (I) can bind two independent sites with the same afﬁnity, i.e., the
inhibition constant, Ki, is identical for both inhibitor binding sites. The ®factor indicates
that binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate S. The enzyme-substrate
with one inhibitor molecule can generate the product by a fraction ¯ofk2but it cannot
when two inhibitor molecules are bound. The rate equation for this kinetic scheme is
derivedas followAPPENDIXB. DERIVATIONOF ENZYME RATEEQUATIONS 182

Calculation of reactionrates
C.1 Initial rates
In chapter six and seven, the initial rate was determined by calculating the slope of the
tangent at the onset of the reaction or progress curve so that the points considered did not
exceed10 % conversionas shownin Figure C.1).
C.2 Calculationofaveragereactionratesandofratecon-
stants fromthe immobilized laccase reactor
For dye decolourizations conducted with the CPC-silica-laccase packed bed, the reactor
inlet and outlet concentration were monitored and recorded (Figure C.2 and C.3). The rate
of decolourizationin the packedbed wascalculated as follow:
The rate of decolourization in the reactor wascalculated as follow
²Cinlet=17.59 mg/l
²Coutlet= 7.36 mg/l
