 Bioremediation of synthetic dyes pollution by white rot fungi ( Pleurotus  spp.) 
ABSTRACT 
In the present investigation the efficiency of four species of white rot fungus - Pleurotus  
(P. flabellatus, P. ostreatus, P. sajor-caju  and P. citrinopileatus ) and their improved 
dikaryons (heterokaryons) were studied for decolorization of five azo dyes (Acid black, 
Congo red, Methyl orange, Methyl red and Phenol Red)  and production of lignin peroxidase 
(LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase enzymes. These species of Pleurotus were 
selected out of nine species. Among the five dyes, Methyl orange decolourization was faster 
and earlier i.e. 96.98% on the 20th day on incubation by P. citrinopileatus,  whereas remaining 
four dyes took 25 days for decolourization. 97.42% Congo red, 90.67% Methyl red and 
84.52% Acid black were decolourized by P. flabellatus , and 93.33% Phenol red was 
decolourized by P. citrinopileatus  on 25th day of incubation. Improved dikaryons 
decolourized the dyes more effectively. 
 
INTRODUCTION  
A vast amount of dyes are produce annually with a variety of color and chemical structure 
around the world. These synthetic organic compounds with multiple aromatic rings are either 
fused or connected covalently and modified with various hydrophilic functional groups such 
as amine, carboxylic acid, carbonyl and hydroxyl group to produce desired color and increase 
affinity to the material being dyed. These dyes are generally employed as coloring agent in 
food, pharmaceutical, woolen, paper, metal, cosmetic and textile industries (1). The textile 
industries are major consumer of these dyes and account for two-thirds of the total dyestuff 
market. The increasing use of synthetic dyes is alarming and their discharge as textile waste 
may cause substantial ecological damage. Many synthetic dyes are nontoxic, some of their 
degradation by products such as anilines are often more toxic and sometimes carcinogenic 
than the parent compounds. In addition to the toxicity, residual organic dye can also exert 
various hazards on the aquatic ecosystem by depleting dissolved oxygen, blocking sunlight 
penetration, inhibiting photosynthesis and growth of aquatic organism (2,3). 
Removal of color from dye containing wastewater is a current issue of discussion and 
regulation in many countries, because water is a viable asset that should be protected (4). The 
conventional physical and chemical methods possess inherent limitations such as high cost, 
formation of hazardous byproducts and intensive energy requirement (5,6). In spite of the 
existing physical/chemical technologies, biological process provide an alternative, because 
they are cost effective, eco-friendly and can be applied to wide range of dye containing 
effluents (7,8,9). Currently, a lot of studies have focused on white rot fungi (WRF) than seem 3 
 to be more prospective organism (10,11). Due to extracellular nonspecific enzyme system 
WRF are so far exclusive in their strong oxidative capability. Pleurotus  is a WRF belonging 
to the family Pleurotaceae  produce two major families of enzymes generally termed 
ligninolytic enzymes i.e. extracellular peroxidase (Manganese Peroxidase, MnP; Manganese 
Independent Peroxidase MIP; Lignin Peroxidase, LiP and Versatile Peroxidase, VP) and 
Phenol oxidase (Laccase). However, not much attention has been raised for its decolorization 
ability. The current work is to source out the capability, efficacy and efficiency of the 
Pleurotus  species and its improved dikaryons (heterokaryons) in production of LiP, MnP and 
Laccase enzymes and in decolorizing the synthetic textile dye such as PSP on different pH, 
age and concentration of inoculum, surfactants viz. sodium dodecyl sulphate and Tween-80. 
This research is also indirectly contributing knowledge to wastewater treatment in textile 
industries. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Cultures and their maintenance 
The pure cultures of P. flabellatus, P. ostreatus, P. sajor-caju and P. citrinopileatus  used in 
present experiments were procured from Directorate of Mushroom Research, Solan and 
Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. Throughout the study, the stock cultures 
were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants at 250C and sub-cultured at regular 
interval of three weeks.   
Production of enzymes 
The experiment on production of ligninolytic enzymes was carried out in potato dextrose 
broth medium (20% peeled potato and 2% dextrose). Double distilled water was used for 
preparation of the medium and pH was adjusted at 6.0 by using N/10 NaOH or N/10 HCl. 
Incubation was carried out at 250C in BOD incubator in cotton plugged 250 ml Erlenmeyer 
flask containing 100 ml of media. Each flask inoculated with 1 mm in diameter of agar pieces 
of Pleurotus  species and improved dikaryons from actively growing area on potato dextrose 
agar plate.  
Extraction of extracellular enzymes 
Samples of substrate were collected at regular interval of 5 days and extracted in 
phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for ligninolytic enzymes. Filtrate of extraction was used for 
enzyme assay.  
Enzymatic study 
Lignin Peroxidase (1.11.1.14) 
Lignin peroxidase activity was determined using veratryl alcohol as substrate. The 
reaction mixture contained 1 ml of crude enzyme extract, 0.5 ml of 2 mM veratryl alcohol, 4 
 1.5 ml of 0.1 mM Sodium tartrate buffer (pH 2.5) and 0.2 ml of 0.4 mM H 2O2. The oxidation 
of substrate was followed by spectrophotometrically at λ max 310nm. One activity unit was 
defined as 1µmol of veratryl alcohol oxidized per minute.  
Manganese Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.13) 
Manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity was determined using guaiacol as substrate. The 
reaction mixture contained 0.2 ml of 0.5 M Na-tartrate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.1 ml of 1 mM 
MnSO 4, 0.1ml of 1mM H 2O2, 0.25 ml of 1 mM guaiacol and 0.3 ml of crude enzymes. The 
oxidation of substrate at 300C was followed spectrophotometrically at λ max 465nm (12). 
Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) 
Laccase activity was determined via the oxidation of o-methoxyphenol catechol 
monomethylether (guaiacol) as substrate. The reaction mixture contained 1 ml of 1mM 
guaiacol in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 1ml of crude enzyme solution was 
incubated at 300C for 10 min. The oxidation was followed by the increase in absorbance at 
λmax 495nm. (13).  
Fructification and basidiospore isolation 
Cultivation 
The method of spawn, substrate preparation and spawning were described in our earlier 
published paper (14, 15) and illustrated in Figure 1.A-C.  
Spore Print 
The dropping spores were selected from healthy and young fruit bodies to prepare spore 
prints. The cap of the mushroom fruit body was cut down and kept on sterilized paper, on the 
sterilized petriplate, with gills down (Figure 1.D). The petriplate was then sealed properly 
with cello tape and the entire setup was placed in an undisturbed area for overnight. When the 
cap was removed, the spore prints were collected in the petriplate on paper. Then the resulted 
spore prints of Pleurotus species were stored at 40C for their use in single spore isolation. 
Germination and isolation of homokaryons 
Paper bearing spores was cut into 2x2 cm size and suspended in 0.5% NaCl in 100 ml 
sterilized double distilled water and agitated at 150 rpm in orbitary shaker for 2 hour to make 
uniform suspension (Figure 1.E). The spore suspension further serially diluted up to 10-4 
dilution from which 150 ml of the spore suspension was transferred and spread to each 
petriplate containing 18-20 ml of solid agar medium under aseptic condition. The inoculated 
petriplate were incubated at 250C in BOD incubator for one week. After germination of 
single spore (Figure 1.F) marked with the help of permanent marker on backside of petriplate, 
it was lifted with the help of a fine tip of inoculation needle and transferred to another 
petriplate containing 18-20 ml potato dextrose agar medium under aseptic condition. The 5 
 single spore colonies were confirmed by lacking of clamp connection through microscopy. 
Then these colonies were sub-cultured on PDA slants and incubated at 250C in BOD 
incubator for further use. 
Hyphal anastomosis 
At least 12 monokaryons from four selected Pleurotus  species were randomly selected and 
144 combinations of the above cultures were stabilised for compatibility test. The mating 
compatibility between homokaryotic cultures were performed in duel culture technique by 
placing actively growing mycelia (1mm in diameter) of single spore cultures of above two 
strains  approximately 1cm apart in the center of a 90 mm petridish of potato dextrose agar . 
Three replicates were used for each combination and arranged in a completely randomized 
design. A total of these 16 groups will be obtained from four selected species. After that these 
16 groups will be mated with each other to develop heterokaryons. In each step crosses will 
be confirmed through clamp connection under 100X magnification with suitable stain. After 
the confirmation a sample of mycelia was transferred to fresh agar medium for further 
examination of dye tolerance level in liquid broth. 
 
Decolorization studies in liquid media 
The mycodecolorization experiments were done in potato dextrose broth medium 
supplemented with PSP 300 mg/l. Each inoculated with screened species and improved strain 
of Pleurotus  in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml media and incubated in stagnant 
condition in BOD incubator at 250C. Dye disappearance was detected spectrophotometrically 
(Elico 164-SL) at λ max 497 nm for PSP after 20th days of incubation. Results were reported as 
the mean value of percent dye decolorization (% DD) for three replicates (16).  
Optimization of parameter for PSP decolorization 
Effect of pH  
All Pleurotus  species and heterokaryons (dikaryons) were incubated with dye containing 
liquid broth medium to evaluate maximum dye decolorization at different pH value ranging 
from 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0. The pH was determined with electronic pH meter model- 361. Before 
sterilization of media, their pH was adjusted to the required level using N/10 NaOH or N/10 
HCl.  
Effect of age and concentration of inoculums 
Mycelial bits of 1 mm in diameter were inoculated in 100 ml of potato dextrose broth 
medium in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated in BOD incubator at 250C for 10 and 15 
days. After the maximum growth of mycelia, homogenize suspension was made at 150 rpm 
in orbitary shaker with the help of sterilized small glass pieces. The mycelial suspension was 6 
 then inoculated in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask, containing 30 mi dye containing broth medium 
at the concentration of 3 mi and 5 mi and incubated in BOD incubator for observing the dye 
decolorization (17). 
Effect of surfactants 
Two types of surfactants - anionic surfactant i.e. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and 
nonionic surfactant i.e. Tween-80 were used with the dye. The concentration varied from 0.5 
mM, and 1.0 mM of SDS, 0.1% and 0.2% of Tween-80 in 100 ml Erlenmayer flasks 
containing 30 ml dye in broth medium. Mycelial bits of 1 mm in diameter of Pleurotus  
species and improved dikaryons was inoculated and incubated in BOD incubator at 250C for 
observing the dye decolorization (18). 
Effect of Aromatic Amino Acid: 
The effects of aromatic amino acids on dye decolourisation were tested. The stock solution of 
Tyrosine, Tryptophan and Phenylalanine were sterilized by membrane filter and stored in 
dark brown amber bottles. These amino acids were added to pre-sterilized 100ml erlenmayer 
flask, containing 30ml dye potato dextrose broth medium at various concentration viz. 0.2 
µM and 0.4 µM. The inoculums of Pleurotus  strains was inoculated and incubated at 27± 20 
C for observing dye decolourization. 
Effect of Trace Element 
 To study the effect of trace elements like CuSO 4.5H2O, MnSO 4.H2O and ZnSO 4.7H2O at the 
concentration of 25ppm and 50ppm were selected for dye decolourization. These trace 
elements were added at above concentration in 100ml erlenmayer flask containing 30ml dye 
Potato Dextrose broth medium and selected Pleurotus strains were inoculated and incubated 
in BOD incubator at 27± 20 C for observing dye decolourization. 
Results 
Screening and Selection of Pleurotus species : 
All the nine species of Pleurotus showed slow mycelial growth in the initial stage i.e., on 3rd 
day and fast growth after 3rd day. They took 12 days to fill the petridish and showed different 
rate of decolourization except P. citrinopileatus , which took 9 days to fill the petri dish and 
caused maximum decolourization. P. flabellatus , P. ostreatus  and P. sajor-caju , took 12 days 
to cover the whole petridish. Whereas, P. florida , P. sapidus, P.roseus  and P. eryngii showed 
relatively slow decolourization rate and took 15 days. The vegetative growth of P. fossulatus  
was inhibited and mycelia took 18 days to complete decolourization. 
Enzymatic study 
The activity of lignin peroxidase, Manganese activity and Laccase were determined under in 
vitro condition on Acid black, Congo red, Methyl orange, Methyl red and Phenol red. As 7 
 mentioned in the materials and methods earlier, test samples for enzyme assay were taken 
from liquid culture containing 0.02% dye inoculated with selected Pleurotus species. 
Enzymatic analysis was carried out at 5 day interval. During this study four most promising 
species of Pleurotus were identified as better decolourizer of Poly R-478 dye among the nine 
species on solid medium. The selected four species ( P. flabellatus ,  P. ostreatus , P. sajor-
caju, and P. citrinopileatus ) were carried out for the five azo dye (Acid black, Congo red, 
Methyl orange, Methyl red and Phenol red) decolourization and activities of ligninolytic (LiP, 
MnP and laccase) enzymes. The higher activity of LiP was observed by P. citrinopileatus in 
liquid media supplemented with Acid black followed by P. flabellatus on Congo red, Phenol 
red and Methyl orange, while the lowest activity was recorded on Methyl red by P. 
citrinopileatus. P. citrinopileatus showed maximum MnP activity in liquid media containing 
Methyl orange and Acid black followed by P. flabellatus on Phenol red and Congo red, 
whereas the miniumum MnP activity was recorded on Congo red by P. flabellatus. 
 In Methyl orange supplemented liquid media, P. ostreatus showed maximum laccase 
activity followed by P. citrinopileatus on Acid black, Phenol red and Methyl red and the 
minimum laccase activity in Congo red containing media. Among the five dyes, Methyl 
orange decolourization was faster and earlier i.e. 96.98% on the 20th day on incubation by P. 
citrinopileatus, whereas remaining four dyes took 25 days for decolourization. 93.33% 
Phenol red decolourized by P. citrinopileatus on 25th day of incubation. 
Ligninolytic enzymes 
The lignin peroxidase activity of all the five species including basidiospore derived 
dikaryons is given in Fig 2. After 5 days of incubation Poc 9X6 showed 28.55 U LiP activity 
whereas, P. ostreatus , P. citrinopileatus, P. flabellatus and Pfo 6X9 showed 18.97U, 19.54U, 
20.23U and 22.10U, respectively. After 15 days, improved dikaryons Poc 9x6 showed 
maximum LiP activity i.e., 72.80U followed by P. flabellatus, P. citrinopileatus, Pfo 6X9 and 
P. ostreatus. 
Fig. 3 shows manganese peroxidase activity of Pleurotus  species and their basidiospore 
derived dikaryons. After 5 days of incubation Poc9X6 showed 315.70U MnP activity 
whereas, P. ostreatus, P. flabellatus, P. citrinopileatus and Pfo 6X9 showed 198.54U, 
270.33U, 289.37U and 290.80U, respectively. During time course of culturing, basidiospore 
derived dikaryons Poc 9X6 showed maximum LiP activity i.e., 615.15U on 10th day of 
incubation, followed by P. flabellatus, P. ostreatus, P. citrinopileatus and Pfo 6X9. 
Laccase activity of all the Pleurotus  species and basidiospore derived dikaryons is 
presented in Fig 4.  Among all five species including dikaryons, after 5 days Pfo 6X9 
achieved 425.92U laccase activity, whereas P. ostreatus, P. citrinopileatus, P. flabellatus and 8 
 Poc 9X6 showed 297.33U, 347.78U, 358U and 420.15U, respectively. After 10th day, the 
improved dikaryons Poc 9X6 showed maximum laccase activity i.e., 715.25U followed by 
Pfo 6X9, P. citrinopileatus, P. flabellatus  and P. ostreatus. 
Optimization of parameter for dye decolorization 
Effect of pH 
Different pH was studied for enzymes activity and decolorization of PSP by Pleurotus  
species and improved dikaryons at pH 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0 is shown in fig. 5. Among the all three 
pH, best result in term of decolorization was achieved at pH 5.5 by Poc 9X6 followed by 
others. 
Effect of Age and concentration of inoculum 
Fig 6 illustrates  the effect of mycelial age and concentration of all Pleurotus  species and 
improved dikaryons for PSP decolorization. The maximum decolorization was gained by 5 
ml 10 days old culture of Poc 9X6 followed by others. 
Surfactant 
The effect of surfactants i.e., SDS and Tween-80 on Pleurotus species and improved 
dikaryons for PSP decolorization is depicted in Fig 7. 0.1% Tween-80 and 0.5 mM SDS 
supported to Poc 9X6 for maximum decolorization in comparison to others. 
Strain Improvement: 
The strain improvement program was started with the isolation of 12 monokaryones 
from each species of Pleurotus  by the spore print generation. 48 monokaryons 
(homokaryons) were tested for mating response, further the monokaryons with similar mating 
behavior were sorted out and were rearranged and classified into four distinct groups (A1B1, 
A1B2, A2B1 and A2B2). A total of 16 groups were obtained from four selected species and 
these groups mated with each other to develop dikaryons (heterokaryons). Then these 
developed dikaryons were screened on agar plate containing 0.02% Poly R-478. Four most 
promising dikaryons (heterokaryons) i.e. Pfo 6X9. Poc9X6 and Pscc 8X3 were selected on 
the basis of higher growth rate (radial growth) and decolorization on potato dextrose agar 
media containing screening dye. 
 After the selection of most promising dikaryons (heterokaryons), these were 
inoculated in liquid medium supplemented with Poly R-478 at the concentration of 0.02%, 
0.025% and 0.03% for the evaluation of tolerance level. At the higher concentration Poc 9X6 
and Pfo 6X9 showed better decolorization, whereas less or no decolorization was found by 
Pscc 8X3 and Posc 4X6. 
Effect of Amino acids on enzymes activities and Acid black decolourization: 9 
 The increased LiP activity if improved dikaryon (heterokaryon) was observed in the 
Acid black containing media supplemented with the 2.0 µM Tryotophan, whereas 2.0 µM 
tyrosine assisted the maximum MnP and laccase activity by improved heterokaryons in the 
Methyl orange and Acid black containing media, respectively. The maximum Phenol red 
decolorization was also found by improved dikaryon in the presence of 2.0 um Tyrosine. 
Effect of Trace elements on enzymes activities with Acid black decolourization: 
The effect of trace elements like Copper (Cu), Manganese(Mn) and Zinc (Zn) at 
25ppm and 50ppm on the improved dikaryons of Pleurotus  species for Lignin peroxidase, 
Manganese peroxide, Laccase and decolorization of Acid black were analyzed at regular 
interval of 5 days over the incubation period of 25 days. It was found that the lower 
concentration of Zn supported the maximum LiP activity, while the MnP activity was higher 
in the presence of Mn at lower concemtration. The laccase activity and decolourization of the 
dye was achieved by improved heterokaryons in the presence of Cu at lower concentration.  
The main finding of the present study is that the improved dikaryons (heterokaryons) 
showed better ligninolytic enzymes activities and decolourization of the above mentioned 
dyes in comparison to parent ( Pleurotus ) species. It was also found that all studied 
parameters i.e. pH, age and concentration of inoculum, surfactants, aromatic amino acids and 
trace elements, markedly affect the enzymes activity and dye decolourization.  
Discussion 
In the present study four most promising species of Pleurotus  i.e. P. flabellatus , P. ostreatus , 
P. sajor-caju  and P. citrinopileeatus  were selected out of nine, which showed complete 
decolourization of Poly R-478 on the 12th day of incubation. Out of four dikaryons 
investigated for dye decolourization, two heterokaryons Poc 9X6 and Pfo 6X9 performed 
better than the other two dikaryons i.e. Pfsc 8X7 and Pfc 4X6. Heterokaryons Pfo 6X9 and 
Poc 9X6 decolourized the dye completely in 9 days, whereas Pfsc 8X7and pfc 4X6 
decolourized it in 12 days. The probable reason for the fast decolourization of Poly R-478 by 
improved dikaryons than parental ( Pleurotus ) species may be due to increased biomass 
production led to higher extracellular enzymatic activity. The decolorization of dyes mainly 
depends upon the enzymes production by microbes. Faster dye degradation by the white rot 
fungus P.chrysosporium has been observed by other workers as well. Several known white 
rot fungal species i.e . I. lacteus ,  P. ostreatus , T. versicolor , P. chysosporium  and 
Bjerkandera species are capable of efficient decolorization of a broad spectrum of chemically 
different dyes.  
             The lignin modifying enzymes (LMEs) i.e. lignin peroxidases (Lip E.C. 1.11.1.14); 
magnese peroxidases (MnP.E.C.1.11.1.13) and laccases (Lac, E.C.1.10.3.2), are produced by 10 
 some WRF while, other produces only one or two of them (18, 19). There are two major 
families of ligninolytic enzymes which are involved in lignolysis: peroxidases and laccases 
(20-22). These enzymes are capable of forming radicals inside the lignin polymer, which 
results in destabilization of bonds and finally in the breakdown of the macromolecule of 
lignin (23). Pleurotus species have been reported the produce all the three modifying 
enzymes, which play a vital role in biodegradation and bioremediation (14, 15, 24). 
Ligninolytic enzymes are produced in the initial stage while, cellulolytic and xylanolytic 
enzymes are produced in the later stage of growth of Pleurotus species (24, 25). The 
improved dikaryons (heterokaryons) exhibited maximum LiP activity than all the Pleurotus 
species. Eichlerova et al. also reported similar observations that the isolates showed higher 
production of lignolytic enzyme in comparison to parental strain in synthetic dyes containing 
medium (26). The observation of tolerance level of Poly R-478 by improved dikaryons 
(heterokaryons) (Table 4.28), indicate that the Pfo 6X9 and Poc 9X6 decolourized the dye at 
the concentration of 0.02%, 0.025% and 0.03%. The poor decolourization was observed by 
Pocc 8X3, whereas Posc 4X6 at 0.03% failed to decolourized Poly R-478. Dye concentration 
had a negative effect on decolourization rate in general.  Due to toxicity of the dyes to the 
microbial cells, the production of microbial biomass remains lower at higher dye 
concentrations. LiP catalyzes several oxidations in the side chains of lignin and related 
compounds by one-electron abstraction to form reactive radicals (27, 28). Also the cleavage 
of aromatic ring structures has been reported (29). LiP are not essential for the attack on 
lignin: several highly active WRF and litter-decaying fungi (e.g. Ceriopsis subvermispora, 
Dichotomitus squalens, Panus tigrinus, Rigidosporus lignosus ) do not excrete this enzyme 
(30-33). The higher MnP activity was observed by improved dikaryons whereas, the parental 
(Pleurotus ) species showed less MnP activity in PSP containing media. The basidospore 
derived monokaryotic isolates is an efficient method of reaching higher variation in the 
production of MnP (34,35). The principle role Mn2+ to Mn3+, which then binds to 
appropriate ligands, diffuses from the enzyme and in turn oxidizes phenolic substrate (36-38). 
Lignin as well as recalcitrant xenobiotics such as nitroaminotoluenes (23,39) and synthetic 
textile dyes (17). The improved dikaryons (heterokaryons) showed higher laccase activity in 
PSP containing medium than the parental species. Laccase and other lignolytic enzyme 
showed higher production on dikaryons of Pleurotus species obtained after crossing of 
compatible basidiospore-derived monokaryons selected from the parental basidiospore 
population on the basis of exceptionality in enzyme production (34,40). Decolourization of 
synazol red (azo red) by P. ostreatus is 96% in 24 days at pH 5.5 whereas, the enzyme 
exhibited highest activity at pH 6.0 (15). Srivastava et al., reported pH 5.5 as best for 11 
 decolourization of  Direct red by improved strains of Pleurotus species (41). Dominguez et 
al. (6) reported that, pH 4.5 supported higher peroxidase activity by P. chrysosporium  on 
media containing Poly R-478. 8 ml 4 days old mycelia suspension of white rot fungi was 
effective for decolorization of Acid yellow 99, Acid blue 300, and Acid red 114 (17). 
Maximum decolorization of Direct red was achieved by 5 ml of 10 days old culture of 
Pleurotus  and its improved strains. According to Mittar et al, the maximum decolorization of 
paper and pulp mill effluents could be seen by using 20% of 7 days old culture of P. 
chrysosporium  (42). Urek, et al reported, 0.05% of Tween-80 supported highest MnP activity 
(37). Tween 80 contains an oleat (an unsaturated fatty acid) which can peroxidised by MnP 
and the oxidant so generate could participate in organo- pollutant degradation by fungal 
culture (43). According to Srivastava et al., 0.1% Tween-80 supported maximum 
decolorization of Direct red (19).  
In the present investigation, the effect of trace element on the improved dikaryons 
(heterokaryons) for dye decolorization was studied. 25 ppm of Cu supported maximum 
decolorization of acid Black 0.03% than Mn and Zn. Because copper is a prosthetic group of 
laccase enzyme and the causative agent of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which enhances the 
degradation of the dye. The minimum decolorization of Congo red by improved dikaryon was 
observed in the presence of 25 ppm of Zn. The significant increase in and decolorization 
efficacy at 10 dikaryon copper is the well-known fact that copper is an inducer of laccase. 
The expression of laccase in the white rot fungus is generally regulated at the level of gene 
transcription by copper.  Lignolytic enzymes and ROS have reacted synergistically and 
improved  the dye decolorization.  
Summary 
The summary of the present investigation on selection and improvement of the Pleurotus  
species for azo dye decolorization along with the enzyme activities are given below. 
During this study four most promising species of Pleurotus  were identified as better 
decolourizer of Poly R-478 dye among the nine species on solid medium. The selected four 
species (P. flabellatus, P. ostreatus, P. sajor-caju and P. citrinopileatus ) were carried out for 
the five azo dye (Acid black, Congo red, Methyl orange, Methyl red and Phenol red) 
decolorization and activities of lignolytic (LiP, MnP and laccase) enzymes. 
The higher activity of LiP was observed by P. citrinopileatus in liquid media supplemented 
with Acid black followed by P. flabellatus  on Congo red, phenol red and methyl orange 
while the lowest activity was recorded on methyl Red by P. citrinopileatus.  12 
 P. citrinopileatus  showed maximum MnP activity in liquid media containing methyl orange 
and Acid black followed by P. flabellatus  on Phenol red and Congo red, whereas the 
maximum MnP activity was recorded on Congo red by P .flabellatus . 
In methyl orange supplemented liquid media, P. ostreatus  showed maximum laccase activity 
followed by P. citrinopileatus  on Acid black, Phenol red and Methyl red and the minimum 
laccase activity in Congo red containing media. 
Among the five dyes, methyl orange decolorization was faster and earlier i.e. 96.98% on the 
20th day on incubation by P. citrinopileatus,  whereas remaining 4 dyes took 25 days for 
decolorization. 97.42% Congo red, 90.6 7% methyl red and 84.52% Acid black were 
decolourized by P. flabellatus  letters and  93.33% phenol red was decolourized by P. 
citrinopileatus  25th day of incubation. 
The strain improvement program was started with the isolation of 12 monokaryons from each 
species of Pleurotus  by the spore print generation. 48 monokaryons (homokaryons) were 
tested for mating response, further the monokaryons with similar mating behavior were  
stored out and were rearrange and classified into four distinct group (A1B1, A1B2, A2B1 and 
A2B2). A total of 16 group were obtained from four selected species and these group mated 
with each other to develop  dikaryon (heterokaryons). Then these developed dikaryon were 
screened on agar plates containing 0.02% poly R-478. Four most promising dikaryons 
(heterokaryons) i.e. Pfo 6X9, Posc4X6, Poc9X6 and Pscc 8X3 were selected on the basis of 
higher growth rate (radial growth) and decolorization on potato dextrose agar containing my 
media containing screening dye. 
After the selection of most promising dikaryons (heterokaryons), these were inoculated in 
liquid medium supplemented with poly R-478 at the concentration of 0.02%, 0.025% and 
0.03% for the evaluation of tolerance level. At the higher concentration Poc 9X6 and Pfo 6X9 
showed better decolourization, whereas less or no decolorization was found by Pscc 8X3 and 
Posc 4X6.  
Different pH was studied for enzymes activity and decolorization of the earlier mentioned 
dyes.  pH 5.5 facilitated dikaryons (heterokaryons) for the maximum activity of a LiP, MnP 
and laccase enzymes as well as dye decolorization in comparison to other pH. 
The effect of age and concentration of inoculum were also studied. It was found that 5 ml of 
10 days old culture support maximum activity of LiP and Laccase by Pfo 6X9 on Congo red 
and Poc 9X6 on methyl red. On contrary or this result 3ml of 10 days old culture of Poc 9X6 
showed maximum MnP activity. In dye decolorization study 5 ml of 10 days old culture is 
effective for decolorization of all the dyes except Acid black which decolourized by 5 ml of 
15 days old culture of improved dikaryon i.e. Poc 9X6. 13 
 Effect of surfactant example SDS (anionic) and tween-80 (cationic) on the enzyme activity 
and decolorization of the dye were investigated 0.1% tween-80 supported to dikaryon for 
maximum LiP and laccase activity on dye containing liquid medium while MnP showed 
maximum activity in the presence of 0.5 mM SDS by improved dikaryon. The maximum 
decolorization of dye (methyl red) by improved dikaryon was also found with 0.1% tween-
80. 
The increased LiP activity of improved dikaryon (heterokaryon) was observed in the Acid 
black containing media supplement with 2.0µM Tryptophan, whereas 2.0µM tyrosine 
assisted the maximum MnP and laccase activity by improve heterokaryon in the methyl 
orange in acid Black containing media respectively. The maximum phenol red decolorization 
was also found by improved dikaryon in the presence of 2.0µM tyrosine. 
The effect of trace elements on the improved dikaryon (heterokaryons) for enzymes activities 
and dye decolorization were estimated during the present investigation. It was found that the 
lower concentration of Zn supported the maximum LIiP activity, while the MnP activity was 
higher in the presence of Mn at lower concentration. The laccase activity and decolourization 
of the dye was achieved by improved heterokaryon in the presence of Cu at lower 
concentration. 
The main finding of the present study is that the improved dikaryon (heterokaryon) showed 
better lignolytic enzyme activities and decolorization of the above mentioned I in comparison 
to parent ( Pleurotus)  species. It was also found that all studied parameters i.e. pH, age  and 
concentration of inoculum, surfactants, aromatic amino acid and trace elements markedly 
affect the enzyme activity and dye decolorization.
