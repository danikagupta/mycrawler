ABSTRACT:  28 
White rot fungi (WRF) produce lignolytic enzymes comprised by laccases and peroxidases 29 
responsible for mineralization of recalcitrant lignin.  Because of the so -called lignin modifying 30 
enzymes(LME's), these fungi have potential applications in biodegradati on and bioremediation 31 
processes. Increased demand for lignolytic enzymes to exploit their various applications has 32 
sparked interest in identifying and characterizing new novel strains of WRF. Despite this 33 
undisputed biotechnological significance, molecular  identification of WRF, remains a daunting 34 
task for researchers as genomic DNA isolation is a tedious process, unsuccessful many a times 35 
because of their rigid and resistant cell walls. A rapid, effective and efficient method to identify 36 
the innumerable fu ngal strains within   no time is the need of the hour. The fungal mycelia of 37 
various unknown as well as know isolates of WRF, after alternative washing with TE buffer and 38 
sterile water were suspended in TE buffer. Fungi in solution were then exposed to mic rowave. 39 
The crude extract contained genomic DNA which was extracted and amplified using ITS primers 40 
for further identification.  Based on sequencing results the identity of known cultures was 41 
confirmed, while  the unknown cultures were identified  as Clitopi lus scyphoides (AGUM004 , 42

IMPORTANCE: 51 
White rot fungi which decay wood, possess selective lignin degrading enzymes responsible for 52 
degrading a wide variety of environmental pollutants, xenobiotic compounds in addition to 53 
mineralizing chemicals that are insoluble and recalcitrant. Lignolytic enzymes hold potential 54 
towards replacing conventional chemical processes and their  increased demand in the market   55 
has ignited interest in identifying and characterizing new strains of WRF.  A rapid, efficient 56 
method capable of  quickly identify ing fungal isolates is a constraint. The microwave method is a 57 
novel quick method for isolating superior quality DNA. Its adoption circumvents the initial 58 
purification steps and /or interference of PCR inhibitors, which are encompassed in the use of 59 
conventional methods. The microwave method thus permits the thorough amplification of the 60 
ITS region thereby aiding in the easy identification of unknown species. Use  of the microwave 61 
method will permit researchers to obtain DNA from fungi very quickly for further application in 62 
molecular studies.  63 
Key words :  microwave method, genomic DNA,  isolation, identification, white rot fungi 64

INTRODUCTION: 66 
White rot fungi (WRF) are a group of fungi belonging to the Basidiomycetces which degrade the 67 
lignin components from lignocellulosic substances causing bleaching of the wood  [1]. WRF 68 
produce the set of enzymes viz. Laccase (Lac), Manganese peroxidase (MnP), lignin peroxidase 69 certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 (LiP) and Versatile peroxidase (VP) which are responsible for the selective degradation of 70 
recalcitrant lignin [ 2 ,3]. Because of this lignin  modifying enzymes, WRF can degrade wide 71 
varieties of environmental pollutants, xenobiotic compounds and also mineralize chemicals that 72 
are insoluble and recalcitrant [4 ]. Hence, they have potential applications in biodegradation and 73 
bioremediation processes. The ability of WRF to degrade lignocellulosic, a central aspect in 74 
industrial uses of cellulosic biomass, such as bioethanol production, manufacture of cellulose 75 
based chemicals and materials including paper and recently in crop residues as animal feed to 76 
improve its nutritive value as they promise environmental friendly technologies [5,6 ]. The ir 77 
biotechnological significance has caused a drastic increase in the demand of these enzymes in the 78 
recent few decades.  79 
Limiting amounts of lignolytic enzymes however, are produced by WRF, and identification of 80 
the produced enzymes impede s the ir commercial use in innumerable potential applications. The 81 
species level identification of WRF (microorganisms), provides deeper  insights on fungal life 82 
cycle, evaluation and molecular aspects of the protein production which in turn helps researchers 83 
to enhance the production of enzymes, identification of new species and meet the increased 84 
demand [7] . On the other hand, we lack standardized protocols for conducting routine molecular 85 
biology research of these microorganisms. Due to high polysaccharide contents, the cell walls of 86 
WRF are rigid and are resistant to DNA extraction by traditional methods [8 ]. In addition, 87 
methods involved in DNA isolation are laborious, tricky, time consuming and very expensive for 88 
isolating DNA of excellent quality [9]. All these methods commonly employ the use of 89 
detergents such as SDS for cell wall lysis, which often inhibits further purification manipulations 90 
[10].  Most of the se methods involve innumerable steps that take lot of time and in addition 91 
possess the threat of contributing PCR inhibitors.  92 certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 In the present study, we report a simple and rapid method based on the application of microwave 93 
for DNA isolation from some of the wild isolates of WRF which was  then used for PCR 94 
amplification and species identification of the unknown strains of  WRF. This method has also 95 
been compared with other easy and rapid methods being used for different fungal species by 96 
researchers around the world.  Qualitative and quantitative analysis of DNA extracted from 97 
different methods was  evaluated based on yield  of DNA, purity in terms of A260/A280 ratio, 98 
PCR and gel electrophoresis. Unknown WRF isolated were identified by sequencing the PCR 99 
product of genomic DNA obtained from microwave method.  100 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  101 
Isolation and storage of WRF strains 102 
Fruiting bodies or basidiocarps of WRF were collected in clean dry self- sealing polythene bags 103 
from forest areas. Amongst the seven wild fungal isolates,  KONA001was collected from  13.8048 104 
º N, 75.2530 º E; AGUM 004, AGUM007, AGUM011 and AGUM021 were collected from 105 
13.5187 º N, 75.0905 º E; BANG001 was collected from12.9470 º N, 77.6077 º E while 106 
TAMI004 was collected from location 08.9342 º N, 77.2778 º E from Karnataka, India . In all 107 
cases the substrate was represented by wood found in various stages of decay. Pure cultures from 108 
collected samples were obtained by tissue culture technique [11 ]. All pure cultures were 109 
maintained on PDA slants and stored at 4° C until further use. The cultures were marked with 110 
information such as number and procurement location. Coriolus versicolor (MTCC138), 111 
Ganoderma lucidium  (MTCC1039) and Pleurotus sajorcaju  (MTCC141) obtained from 112 
Microbial Typing Culture Collection, Chandigarh, India were used as the reference cultures. 113

  116 
Four different methods were evaluated for the Extraction of DNA from the selected unknown 117 
wild isolates of WRF:   118 
Method 1: Rapid mini preparation of DNA   119 
The rapid mini preparation of DNA [12] method was comprised of a small amount of reviv ed 120 
culture being suspended in 500µL of lysis buffer containing 400mM Tris-HCl (pH8), 60mM 121 
EDTA(pH8), 1% Sodium dodecyl sulphate(SDS), 150mM NaCl and the lumps disrupted using 122 
sterile loop. Samples were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The samples were 123 
mixed with potassium acetate (pH 4.8) and centrifuged at10000Xg for 2  min and the supernatant 124 
in fresh Eppendorf spun again. Then the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 125 
isopropyl alcohol by brief inversion. The sample was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 10,000Xg and 126 
the supernatant was discarded. The pellet had DNA and was washed in 300µL 70% alcohol. 127 
After the pellet was centrifuged for 1 minute at, the supernatant was discarded, and DNA was air 128 
dried. The isolated DNA was  then dissolved in 50µl 1X TE buffer .1µL DNA suspension was 129 
used for PCR. 130 
Method 2: Thermolysis Method   131 
In the thermolysis method [13] a small quantity of mycelia was picked by help of a sterile needle 132 
from the fully-grown culture and transferred into 100µL sterile water in a 2 mL micro centrifuge 133 
tubes. The mixture was thoroughly vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000g for 1 minute.to the 134 
pellet, after discarding supernatant 100µl lysis was added. The mixture was incubated at 85 C in 135 
a water bath for 25 minutes. The crude extract contained genomic DNA.1µl supernatant was 136 
used for PCR. 137 certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not this version posted April 24, 2018. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/307066doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 
 Method 3: Microwave thermal shock method 138 
 As per the microwave thermal shock method [14] a small quantity of each of the revi ved 139 
cultures w as suspended in 1mL of washing solution containing 50mmol L-1 Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 140 
25mmol L-1 EDTA, 0.1% Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). 141 
Samples were centrifuged at 6000Xg for 1min.  and the pellets were resuspended in 35µL of lysis 142 
buffer containing 50mmol L-1 Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25mmol L-1 EDTA, 3% SDS, 1.2% PVP. The 143 
mixture was  then placed in a microwave oven (Electrolux EK30CBB6-MGZ;  RF output- 900W ) 144 
and heated at 700W for 45s. 400µl of pre-warmed extraction solution containing 10mmol L-1 145 
Tris –HCl, pH 8, 1mmol L-1 EDTA, 0.3 mol L-1 Sodium acetate, 1.2% PVP were added to the 146 
microwaved sample. The DNA was extracted using phenol chloroform solution followed by 147 
isopropyl alcohol precipitation and 70% ethanol wash. Precipitated DNA was then resuspended 148 
in 100µL TE buffer  (pH 8.0). One µL buffer was used for PCR.  149 
Method 4: Microwave method 150 
All the selected wild isolates were removed from storage and revived on PDA slants at 27±2°C 151 
for 7-10 days. A small amount of mycelium from the grown culture was picked with the help of 152 
a sterile needle and transferred into 1000µL of 1XTE in 2mL micro centrifuge tubes. The 153 
mixture was thoroughly vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000Xg for 1min. The supernatant was 154 
discarded, and the pellet was washed with 1000µL of 1XTE again followed by with 1000µl of 155 
sterile water. After the wash, pellet obtained was resuspended in 200µl of 1XTE. The mixture 156 
was then placed in a microwave oven (Electrolux EK30CBB6-MGZ;  RF output- 900W) and 157 
heated at 900W for 1min.  twice. The crude extract contained genomic DNA. 1µl supernatant was 158 
used for PCR.  159 certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not this version posted April 24, 2018. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/307066doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 
 The q uality and quantity of all isolated DNA w as checked using a Nano drop (Thermo 160 
Scientific) in terms of A260/A280 ratio and ηg  /µL respectively [15]. 161 
Amplification of ITS regions of DNA 162 
Each PCR mixture containe d, 10µL Master Mix (Thermo  scientific) , 0.5 µL of forward and 163 
reverse primers each , and 8 µL of nuclease free water and 1 µL of DNA template to be amplified. 164 
The primer base pairs used for the amplification of ITS regions were: forward  primer ITS1F 165 
(CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA ) and reverse primer ITS4  (TCCTCCGCTTA  TTG  ATA  166 
TGC)  [16]. Primers were procured from Eurofins , India . The PCR consisted of an initial  167 
denaturing step of 5min at 95  ºC followed by 35 cycles of 94  ºC for 50s,  54 ºC for 50s and 72  ºC 168 
for 50s and finished  by final extension step for 10  minutes at 72  ºC [17]. Amplified  PCR 169 
products were resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium 170 
bromide.  171 
The PCR products of the seven unknown cultures KONA001, AGUM004, AGUM007, 172 
AGUM011, AGUM021, BANG001, TAMI004 and MTCC culture MTCC138 were given for 173 
sequencing. Sequences obtained from Eurofins India were aligned against EMBL DNA database. 174 
All sequences were then checked against Gene bank with the help of BLAST.  Culture names 175 
were assigned based on more  than 99% sequence similarity [18]. 176 
 177 
Statistical Analysis 178 
ANOVA was performed to compare the different DNA isolation methods within each WRF 179 
isolate for DNA yield as well as purity. Mean and standard deviations were determined for 180 
replicates. For all the statistical analysis, software, SAS 9.3 was used. 181 certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

RESULTS 183 
The four different methods were used to extract DNA from 10 different WRF (KONA001, 184 
AGUM004, AGUM007, AGUM011, AGUM021, BANG001, TAMI004, MTCC138, 185 
MTCC1039, and MTCC149). The yields of DNA  and quality of DNA, in terms of A260/A280 186 
ratio, obtained from different methods are significantly different at confidence interval 99 % 187 
(Table1). Concentration of DNA in case of method 4 is less than that of  three methods 1, 2 and 3. 188 
However quality is superior in case of DNA  isolated from Method 4 as compared to the other 189 
three methods (Table 1). Concentrations of DNA and purity of DNA obtained by all the methods 190 
are in acceptable range for further molecular studies.  191 
The PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) reveals that using method 1and 2, only 192 
one sample each was got amplified and method 3, only two samples were amplified (Fig.  1 A, B 193 
and C respectively). Only DNA isolated for all the 10 samples from method 4 was subjected to 194 
amplifi cation (Fig1 D). PCR products obtained with the help of method 4 for the seven unknown 195 
cultures and one MTCC culture Coriolus versicolor (MTCC138) were sequenced and were 196 
identified. The unknown cultures submitted to GenBank were identified as Clitopilus scyphoides 197 
(AGUM004 , Bank It  2098576 MH172163 ); Ganoderma  rasinaceum  (AGUM007 , BankIt2098576 198 
MH172163 ); Schizophyllum sp  (KONA001  Bank  It 2098576 MH 172164 ; AGUM011  BankIt  199 
2098576 MH172165 and AGUM021  BankIt2098576  MH172166 respectively ), Coprinellus 200 
disseminatus  (BANG001 , BankIt2098576 MH172167 ) and Lentinus squarrosulus (TAMI004 , 201

 Though all the four methods used for isolating genomic DNA are capable of yielding DNA of 205 
acceptable quality and quantity, only DNA obtained by help of the microwave method could get 206 
amplified in PCR. The major reason behind the DNA not being amplified was  the presence of 207 
PCR inhibitors [19 ]. PCR may be inhibited by the presence of certain chemicals / biomolecules 208 
released from fungal species which may vary from species to species, growth status and media 209 
used for cultivation [20 ].  210 
 The microwave method offers several advantages.  As this method  takes less than 10 minutes to 211 
isolate DNA bulk identification of WRF strains can be achieved very quickly saving precious 212 
time by avoiding innumerable cumbersome steps as is in case of the other methods. Indeed, this 213 
is the first report to isolate WRF genomic DNA by microwave method. In other protocols, a 214 
microwave method was reported for bacterial genomic DNA [21 , 22]. The DNA isolated does 215 
not require chemicals like phenol or chloroform. This method also prevents the release of cell 216 
wall chemicals of WRF and other chemicals released from the species which are known to be 217 
potent PCR inhibitors. The yield of DNA and its purity is also in acceptable range and proven to 218 
amplify ITS region and intern’s  species level identification. 219 
The microwave method described here for WRF is a novel method that takes less than 10 220 
minutes to isolate DNA without any initial purification steps and /or interference of PCR 221 
inhibitors,  permitting the amplification of the ITS region and thereby enabling the easy 222 
identification of unknown species. 223 
 224 
Future works need to be carried out in the direction of other molecular biology research with the 225 
isolated DNA such as whether screening of genes of interest, cloning and expression in a 226 
different host for increased yield of proteins/enzymes which are of commercial and clinical 227 certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 importance, phylogenetic tree construction etc., are possible. There is a possibility of using 228 
Microwave method in environmental and biotechnological studies, because rapid DNA isolation 229 
gives a simple solution to sequence several strains directly or by micro arrays [22 ]. 230 
CONCLUSION 231 
 The microwave method is a novel method taking less than ten  minutes to isolate superior quality 232 
DNA. Its adoption circumvents the initial purification steps and /or interference of PCR 233 
inhibitors,  which are encompassed in the use of conventional methods. The microwave method 234 
thus permits the thorough amplification of the ITS region thereby aiding in the easy 235 
identification of unknown species. Further work in the direction of supplemental molecular 236 
biology research with the isolated DNA such as screening for genes of interest, cloning and 237 
expression in a different host for increased yield of proteins/enzymes of commercial and clinical 238 
importance, phylogenetic tree construction etc., are   however warranted . 239
