Abstract
Originally described in patients with chronic epilepsy, nonconvulsive seizures (NCSs) are being recognized with increasing frequency,
both in ambulatory patients with cognitive change, and even more so in the critically ill. In fact, the majority of seizures that occurin the critically ill are nonconvulsive and can only be diagnosed with EEG monitoring. The semiology of NCSs and the associated
EEG ﬁndings are quite variable. There are a number of periodic, rhythmic or stimulation-related EEG patterns in the critically ill of
unclear signiﬁcance and even less clear treatment implications. The ﬁeld struggles to develop useful diagnostic criteria for NCSs, to stan-dardize nomenclature for the numerous equivocal patterns, and to devise studies that will help determine which patterns should be trea-
ted and how aggressively. This review surveys the evidence for and against NCSs causing neuronal injury, and attempts to develop a
rational approach to the diagnosis and management of these seizures, particularly in the encephalopathic population./C2112007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Early descriptions of convulsive seizures are found in
Babylonian tablets from 2000 BC that emphasize the
supernatural nature of these events. Centuries later, Hippo-
crates wrote on the ‘‘sacred disease’’ and argued that epi-leptic convulsions were manifestations of a diseased brainand recommended physical treatments. Detailed accountsof less overt epilepsies began in the 18th and 19th centurywith the French description of ‘‘petit mal’’ seizures andHughlings Jackson’s ‘‘uncinate ﬁts’’ ( Kaplan, 2002 ). The
advent of EEG in the 20th century allowed physicians to
discover unequivocal seizures in previously unsuspected
circumstances, yet the ﬁeld still struggles to deﬁne theextent of EEG patterns that should be considered ictaland to determine when these events should be treated. Thisreview examines nonconvulsive seizures in the critically illpopulation, particularly emphasizing controversies as to
which EEG patterns should be considered ictal, andexploring the evidence whether such seizures are intrinsi-cally harmful. Whenever possible the American Academy
of Neurology classiﬁcation of evidence scheme is used
(Appendix , for example, see Armon and Evans, 2005 ).
2. Nonconvulsive seizures in encephalopathic patients
The clinical spectrum in nonconvulsive seizures (NCSs)
is protean ( Table 1 ). In the community, NCSs present most
frequently in patients who are confused but remain ambu-latory, while in the hospital NCSs are most frequently diag-nosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). We focus on theobtunded or comatose patients for this article, and in thesecases the clinical diagnosis is often challenging as manifes-
tations are often absent or may consist of only subtle myo-
clonic limb, facial or ocular movements. In fact,approximately 90% of critically ill patients with seizuresrecorded have purely nonconvulsive seizures that areunrecognized at the bedside and can only be diagnosed

Ictal activity may be generalized ( Fig. 1 ) or focal ( Fig. 2 )
in these patients.
Technological advances over recent years have allowed
an ever-increasing number of critically ill patients to bemonitored using continuous digital EEG (CEEG), and ithas become clear that ictal activity is common in this envi-
ronment. The rate of NCSs has varied in published series to
date depending on the patient population studied. The ser-ies from our center involved 570 patients monitored todetect subclinical seizures or for unexplained depressed
level of consciousness, and found 18% were having NCSsand 10% were in nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).Similar studies of consecutive neurologic ICU patientshave found 27–34% with electrographic seizures ( Jordan,
1993; Pandian et al., 2004 ). Notable critically ill subpopu-
lations are patients with diagnoses of intracerebral hemor-
rhage (29% had NCSs) ( Vespa et al., 2003 ), CNS infection
(26%) ( Claassen et al., 2004 ), brain tumor (23%) ( Claassen
et al., 2004 ), severe head trauma (22%) ( Vespa et al., 1999 ),
subarachnoid hemorrhage (18%) ( Claassen et al., 2004;
Dennis et al., 2002 ), and a prior history of epilepsy (31%)
(Claassen et al., 2004 ). Comatose patients who had convul-
sive status epilepticus prior to CEEG monitoring
frequently later demonstrated electrographic seizures
(13–48%) ( DeLorenzo et al., 1998; Treiman et al., 1998 ),
and focal or generalized periodic epileptiform dischargeson EEG also appear to be signiﬁcant predictors for NCSs(Class III and IV evidence). Finally, Towne et al. (2000)
studied 236 consecutive patients with unexplained comaexcluding those that had prior seizures or subtle move-ments that could be ictal, and found that 8% were having
NCSs.

Largely extracted (and expanded) from Kaplan (1996) .J. Jirsch, L.J. Hirsch / Clinical Neurophysiology 118 (2007) 1660–1670 1661Clearly, NCSs are common in neurocritical care patients
and it has become evident that the majority of these eventswould be missed without prolonged EEG studies. The seriesbyPandian et al. (2004) illustrates this point well where all
patients in their series had 30 min routine EEGs at the begin-
ning of their monitoring. The authors found that more than
half of all seizure cases would have been missed without pro-longed recording (routine EEG found seizures in 11% ofpatients vs. 27% with cEEG; median duration of CEEGwas 2.9 days). Similarly, our institution found seizure activ-ity present at the beginning of the EEG record in 16 of 110(15%) patients who would eventually develop ictal activityduring monitoring, and in about half of patients by 1 h.
The duration of monitoring required to exclude the
presence of seizures in critically ill patients remains some-what unclear. Claassen et al. (2004) found that of 110
patients with seizures during CEEG, 95% of noncomatosepatients had their ﬁrst seizure identiﬁed within 24 h ofrecording, but the ﬁrst seizure had been recorded in only80% of the comatose patients. Furthermore, 13% of thecomatose patients with seizures did not have their ﬁrst sei-
zure until more than 48 h of recording. The presence of cer-
tain interictal patterns may help predict a delayed time toﬁrst seizure, and a ﬁnding of periodic lateralized epilepticdischarges (PLEDs) should prompt the clinician to con-
tinue EEG monitoring beyond 24 h as 21% of thesepatients had their ﬁrst seizure after the ﬁrst full day ofcEEG compared with 8% in those without PLEDs (ClassIII evidence). There are almost certainly other important
EEG monitoring variables to help improve the sensitivity
of NCS detection in the ICU, and to date little is knownabout the optimal number of channels or electrodesrequired in these patients.
The speciﬁcity and accuracy of CEEG monitoring for
seizure detection is also incompletely understood. Largecenters that review abundant EEG monitoring records incritically ill patients recognize that a clear division of
EEG patterns as either ictal or interictal is elusive or non-
existent, and interpretation varies considerably among dif-ferent electroencephalographers. Indeed the strength ofevidence suggesting various periodic EEG patterns are pre-dictive of NCSs is weakened in many studies by a lack ofindependent deﬁnitions of the two. EEG patterns that havehistorically been considered non-ictal are on occasionreportedly ictal. A case in point is triphasic waves, which
commonly occur in metabolic encephalopathies but also
in cortical degenerative diseases, CNS infections, and sepsis(Sundaram and Blume, 1987; Young et al., 1990 ). They are

convulsions, but several hours later was poorly responsive. A right parieto-temporal hemorrhage was present on imaging with associated right hemis phere

periodic discharges at 1–2 Hz (but occasionally faster thanthis), often with fronto-occipital lag. Triphasic waves, how-ever, can be diﬃcult to distinguish from NCSE becausewith both patterns patients typically have altered con-sciousness, and discharges may ﬂuctuate at greater than
1H z( Sheridan and Sato, 1986 ). Phase two amplitude pre-
dominance and antero-posterior lag on referential montageare features of triphasic waves that are absent in NCSEaccording to some authors ( Boulanger et al., 2006 ) but
not most others ( Drake and Erwin, 1984; Hormes et al.,
1988; Kaplan, 2004; Chong and Hirsch, 2005 ). Moreover,
even the response to benzodiazepines, which has tradition-ally helped guide epileptologists in identifying ictal pat-
terns, can eliminate or markedly attenuate classic
triphasic waves ( Fig. 3 ;Fountain and Waldman, 2001 ).
Many other periodic EEG patterns in the critically ill are
equally ambiguous. Generalized periodic epileptic dis-charges (GPEDs) have been divided according to inter-dis-charge interval into periodic short interval diﬀusedischarges (PSIDDs with intervals of 0.5–4 s), and periodiclong interval diﬀuse discharges (PLIDDs, 4–30 s). PLIDDs
are very rare and classically occur with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis. Less rare are PSIDDs, which occur mostoften with anoxia–ischemia, Creutzfeld–Jacob disease orafter convulsive status epilepticus ( Fig. 4 ).Yemisci et al.
(2003) found GPEDs with a variety of etiologies to be asso-
ciated with convulsive seizures (Class IV evidence). Husain
et al. (1999) and others ( Brenner and Schaul, 1990; Nei
et al., 1999 ) argued that many instances could be consid-
ered ictal with evolving discharge patterns and/or clinical
improvement in response to antiepileptic drugs. Werecently presented preliminary data from our center com-
paring 98 consecutive patients with generalized periodicdischarges (GPDs) to matched controls also undergoingCEEG monitoring. Patients with GPDs were more likelyto have seizures of any kind (52% vs. 41%), NCSs (29%vs. 13%), and poor outcome (83% vs. 63%) ( Abou Khaled
et al., 2006 ; Class III evidence).
Another EEG pattern in the critically ill is periodic later-
ized epileptic discharges (PLEDs). PLEDs most commonlyoccur following acute focal destructive lesions (e.g. infarct,infection or tumor) or with a combined structural lesionand metabolic insult ( Fig. 5 ). The pattern has traditionally
been considered an interictal epileptiform disturbance,however the discharges have occasionally been described
time-locked to focal motor movements and in these cases
are therefore ictal. Moreover, PLEDs have also been asso-ciated with negative symptoms sometimes seen with NCSs(e.g. aphasia, cognitive changes, even hemiparesis) andthese may improve immediately following AED treatment(Kuroiwa and Celesia, 1980; Snodgrass et al., 1989; Ono
et al., 1997; Brussiere et al., 2005 ).Reiher et al. (1991) rec-
ognized a continuum of periodic discharges from so-called
‘‘PLEDs-proper’’ through ‘‘PLEDs-plus’’ and ﬁnally ictal
activity. PLEDs-plus were distinguished morphologicallyby having low-voltage rhythmic discharges associated intime and spatial distribution with the epileptiform dis-charges ( Fig. 6 ), and these complexes were even more
highly associated with seizures than PLEDs-proper. Thissubcategorization would appear to be useful but remainsto be conﬁrmed. In prolonged recordings, we rarely see a
recording with PLEDs-proper without also seeing
PLEDs-plus or deﬁnite electrographic seizures.

permission.]J. Jirsch, L.J. Hirsch / Clinical Neurophysiology 118 (2007) 1660–1670 1663A recent meeting of The American Clinical Neurophys-
iology Society proposed standardized terminology todescribe rhythmic and periodic EEG patterns in the criti-cally ill patient ( Hirsch et al., 2005 ). Generic terminology
was emphasized that avoids using clinical terminology suchas ‘‘ictal’’, ‘‘epileptiform’’ or ‘‘triphasic waves’’, becausethere is no consensus regarding whether many of these pat-terns are related to seizures, when they are associated with
ongoing neuronal injury, or even the neurophysiological
mechanisms underlying their generation. Moreover, crite-ria for NCSs are evolving and may also help generate uni-formity in the community. The criteria of Young et al.
(1996) , more recently modiﬁed by Chong and Hirsch
(2005) , are shown in Table 2 . The 3 Hz cutoﬀ used as a cri-
terion for the frequency of repetitive epileptic discharges inNCSs is somewhat arbitrary. It is important to note that
when these criteria are not fulﬁlled, NCSE has not been
excluded, it simply cannot be ruled in deﬁnitively. In otherwords, the criteria in the Table are speciﬁc but not sensi-tive. In many real-world situations the ultimate interpreta-tion of ictal vs. non-ictal remains unclear even with expertEEG’ers and proper trials of benzodiazepines.Our suggested method for performing a benzodiazepine
trial is listed in Table 3 . At our center this is performed by
the neurologist or epileptologist with proper nursing sup-port and monitoring of vitals (i.e. ECG, blood pressure,pulse oximetry). Midazolam is our drug of choice in diag-nostic cases because of its rapidly acting pharmacodynamicproperties, as well as its short half-life. Sequential 1 mgdoses are slowly infused intravenously while monitoring
the EEG as well as the patient’s clinical state, EKG, blood
pressure, respirations, and oxygen saturation, until a max-imum dose of approximately 0.2 mg/kg. After each dose, anew EEG and neurological examination assessment is initi-ated, and the trial is stopped if there has been deﬁniteimprovement in either of these two variables, or if thereis evidence of respiratory depression or hypotension. Thismultiple small-step approach is stressed in order to avoid
over-sedation and consequently the window to make the
diagnosis. NCSE cannot be deﬁnitively diagnosed simplybased on the resolution of an EEG pattern without clinicalimprovement in the typical scenario if one large bolus ofbenzodiazepine is given. The test is only considered diag-nostic of NCSE if there has been an improvement in the

cognitive symptoms. [From Chong and Hirsch, 2005 , with permission.]1664 J. Jirsch, L.J. Hirsch / Clinical Neurophysiology 118 (2007) 1660–1670clinical state or if there has been a return of normal EEG
rhythms (e.g. posterior-dominant ‘‘alpha’’ rhythm).
Although we know of no studies to explore the issue, it
seems evident that video and audio recording alongside
EEG is a simple measure to help improve the diagnostic
speciﬁcity during the evaluation of rhythmic electrographicpatterns. Particularly chewing, chest percussion, patting ininfants, and vibrating bed artifact can challenge evenexperts as these may mimic seizures. Video and audio havethe additional utility in helping to characterize non-ictalparoxysmal spells that are common in ICU patients as wellas identifying reactive EEG patterns such as the recently
recognized stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic or ictal dis-
charges (SIRPIDs) ( Hirsch et al., 2004 ).
3. Nonconvulsive seizures: evidence for neuronal injury
Much of the evidence for the deleterious eﬀects of NCSs
is derived from animal models or from human studies inepileptic patients. The concepts of excitoxicity and selectiveCNS vulnerability that have emerged from this literatureare likely applicable to the emerging ﬁeld involving the crit-ically ill population. The still limited range of studiesinvolving the critically ill is explored later.
The detrimental eﬀects of prolonged seizures have long
been emphasized in the neurological community, as SEhas an associated mortality rate of 26% in adults ( DeLor-
enzo et al., 1996 ). This statistic may however be somewhat
misleading and etiology is probably ultimately more impor-tant in the prognosis ( Scholtes et al., 1996; Drislane, 2006 ).
Mortality in patients with SE following brain anoxia is
much higher than that of patients with SE due to lowAED levels (71% vs. 4%). Instead, the more pressing riskis probably lasting intellectual morbidity as evidenced bythe acute and chronic radiologic changes, as well as patho-logical changes particularly in the hippocampus followingSE (Yaﬀe et al., 1995; VanPaesschen et al., 1997; VanLand-
ingham et al., 1998; Cole, 2004 ).
Classic studies by Meldrum and Brierley (1973) on
baboons showed that the intense, prolonged electrochemi-cal excitatory stimulation of SE results in pathologicalchanges, particularly in the hippocampus. Other animalstudies have shown that repeated NCSs and induced NCSEresult in epilepsy and behavioral eﬀects ( Milgram et al.,
1988; Liu et al., 1994; Lothman and Bertram, 1993; Math-ern et al., 1993 ). Early life seizures may be particularly
harmful to the vulnerable immature nervous system as evi-
denced by associated deﬁciencies in a variety of behavioraland cognitive domains with anxiety, exploratory, andmemory impairments in demonstrated in rats ( Lee et al.,
2001; Stafstrom, 2002 ) and humans ( Austin and Dunn,
2002; Neyens et al., 1999; Dodrill and Wilensky, 1990 ).

2005, with permission.]J. Jirsch, L.J. Hirsch / Clinical Neurophysiology 118 (2007) 1660–1670 1665Pediatric SE is clearly not monolithic. Absence SE is asso-
ciated with recurrence ( Guberman et al., 1986 ), but does
not appear to cause lasting eﬀects ( Ellis and Lee, 1978;
Granner and Lee, 1994; Cockerell et al., 1994 ). Moreover,
neurocognitive eﬀects may be less important in adulthumans as demonstrated in one prospective study thateliminated cases of progressive illness and acute symptom-atic SE, and showed no cognitive deterioration in 15 adults
with SE after two years of follow-up ( Adachi et al., 2005 ).
Consensus opinion is that status epilepticus can induce
neuronal injury through a variety of mechanisms. Neuro-nal death occurs by a combination of necrosis and apopto-sis mechanisms with excessive glutamate release(excitotoxicity) resulting in the activation of intracellular

associated with low-amplitude rhythmic faster activity, consistent with PLEDs-plus. This reportedly indicates higher epileptic potential than s o-called
PLEDs-proper (see text). This example was clearly ictal as the patient had continuous motor activity involving the right arm and neck. [From Chong and

Criteria for non-convulsive seizure (from Chong and Hirsch, 2005 , who modiﬁed the criteria of Young et al., 1996 ; reproduced with permission)
Any pattern lasting at least 10 s satisfying any one of the following three primary criteria
Primary criteria•Repetitive generalized or focal spikes, sharp-waves, spike-and-wave complexes at P3/s
•Repetitive generalized or focal spikes, sharp-waves, spike-and-wave or sharp-and-slow wave complexes at <3/s and the secondary criterion
•Sequential rhythmic, periodic, or quasi-periodic waves at P1/s and unequivocal evolution in frequency (gradually increasing or decreasing by at least
1/s, e.g. 2–3/s), morphology, or location (gradual spread into or out of a region involving at least two electrodes). Evolution in amplitude alone is n ot
suﬃcient. Change in sharpness without other change in morphology is not enough to satisfy evolution in morphology
Secondary criterion
•Signiﬁcant improvement in clinical state or appearance of previously absent normal EEG patterns (such as posterior-dominant ‘‘alpha’’ rhythm)
temporally coupled to acute administration of a rapidly acting AED. Resolution of the ‘‘epileptiform’’ discharges leaving diﬀuse slowing without
clinical improvement and without appearance of previously absent normal EEG patterns would not satisfy the secondary criterion

free radicals and programmed cell death ( Fujikawa,
2005). Systemic metabolic derangements associated with
convulsive seizures are also neurotoxic ( Meldrum and Bri-
erley, 1973 ), as are the eﬀects of raised intracranial pressure
and increased metabolic demand (Scott et al., 2002).
Neuronal susceptibility to injury is probably not uni-
form and factors aﬀecting vulnerability may include loca-tion (hippocampus and dentate gyrus), cell type (granulecells), age (mature group), previous seizure history, as wellas other ill-deﬁned genetic factors ( DeGiorgio et al., 1992;
Briellmann et al., 2002; Schauwecker, 2002; Zhang et al.,2002; Sutula and Pitka ¨nen, 2003 ). The neuropsychological
deﬁcits described above likely result from seizure-induced
alterations in neuronal circuitries from receptor changes,
ﬁber sprouting, and alterations in both excitatory andinhibitory connections ( Lynch et al., 1996, 2000 ).
There is less robust evidence that the NCSE or NCSs
most frequently encountered in the intensive care unit(ICU) are destructive. Instances of permanent dysfunctionfollowing prolonged NCSE without any alternate acutebrain insult are in the realm of case reports, and in each
instance seizures were very prolonged, lasting more than
36 h ( Engel et al., 1978; Krumholz et al., 1995 ). Moreover,
models such as that of Meldrum and Brierley (1973) that are
commonly cited to show the damaging eﬀects of SE on thebrain may not be appropriate in the encephalopathic groupbecause seizures in these animal models typically involverapid epileptiform discharges that are much diﬀerent fromthe slower, less intense discharges usually seen in the ICU
(Drislane, 1999 ). In fact, the EEG pattern associated with
NCSs in the critically ill often resembles the generalizedspike and wave seen in absence seizures, an epileptic disor-der that most accept does not cause permanent injury.
There are, however, several convincing epidemiological
and laboratory ﬁndings suggesting that NCSs in theencephalopathic group may be harmful. The Virginiagroup found that continued ictal discharge after clinical
SE was associated with a highly signiﬁcant increase in mor-
bidity and mortality ( Jaitly et al., 1997 ; Class III evidence).
Young et al. (1996) , in their series of 49 patients withNCSs, found that death occurred in 13 of 23 (57%) patients
in NCSE. Age, ICU length of stay and etiology were alsosigniﬁcantly associated with mortality, but after multiplelogistic regression analysis, only seizure duration and delayto diagnosis remained signiﬁcant (Class III evidence).Lastly, in the rodent model of NCSs produced by acute
middle cerebral artery occlusion, NCS events were found
to be positively correlated with both infarct size and mor-tality. When NCSs were prevented with AEDs in this ani-mal model, there was a resultant signiﬁcant reduction inmortality ( Williams et al., 2004 ).
There is also evidence that the acute symptomatic brain
may be particularly prone to the damaging eﬀects of sei-zures. The injured brain undergoes dynamic changes in
neurochemistry that likely cause it to be vulnerable to
increases in metabolic demand associated with seizure dis-charges ( Bergsneider et al., 1997; Bullock et al., 1995 ).Ves-
pa et al. (1998) performed microdialysis in traumatic brain
injury patients and found elevations of glutamate to toxiclevels in association with seizures including NCSE. More-over cerebral perfusion pressures positively correlated withincreases in glutamate during seizure periods and, in the
setting of altered cerebrovascular autoregulation and dam-
aged blood–brain barrier, may lead to hyperemia and fur-ther cell injury. Vespa et al. (2003) later showed that
seizures detected by continuous monitoring after intracere-bral hemorrhage were associated with signiﬁcantlyincreased midline shift and a trend towards worse outcome.A limitation of this last study in the argument for treatingnonconvulsive events, however, was that only 18 patients
had seizures and a few of these were clinical (convulsive)
events, yet both convulsive and nonconvulsive seizureswere analyzed together. Moreover, multivariate analysisshowed that neurological status and age were much greaterpredictors of outcome than the presence or absence of sei-zures. Certainly increased cerebral blood ﬂow and intracra-nial pressure have been associated with seizures, andsymptomatic posturing or herniation has been associated
with seizures in patients with CNS infections ( Solomon
et al., 2002; Idro et al., 2005 ). However, we are
unaware of any well-documented instance of herniationTable 3

sal relationship between seizures (including NCSs), cere-bral edema and progressive midline shift is certainlypossible and perhaps likely, this has not yet been proven.
One ﬁnal line of evidence suggesting that NCSs may be
deleterious involves a biomarker. Neuron speciﬁc enolase
(NSE) is a key enzyme for energy metabolism and is a mar-
ker of acute brain injury as well as damage to the blood–brain barrier ( Correale et al., 1998 ).DeGiorgio et al.
(1999) prospectively measured levels of NSE in consecutive
patients with SE and found signiﬁcant elevations in CPSEand subclinical generalized SE patients, even when therewere no other causes for acute brain injury beyond sei-zures. Moreover, this study found that absolute levels of
NSE correlated with the duration of SE, suggesting that
early treatment of NCSs is desirable.
4. Treatment of nonconvulsive seizures and status epilepticus
While it would appear that NCSs are damaging to the
brain, it is far less obvious that single NCSs or NCSE needsto be treated as aggressively as convulsive varieties for rea-sons outlined above. Claassen et al. (2002) performed a sys-
tematic review comparing various continuous IV infusion
AEDs and pentobarbital in patients treated for refractoryconvulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and founda poor outcome overall (50% mortality) regardless of theagent utilized or the titration goal (i.e. seizure suppressionor background suppression). Pentobarbital treatmentappeared to be more eﬀective in preventing breakthroughseizures than other medications, even in cases of NCSE
which are known to be more refractory to treatment than
GCSE ( Mayer et al., 2002 ), however it is frequently compli-
cated by hypotension, and ultimate outcome was the same.While propofol has a shorter half-life than pentobarbitaland would seem to be safer than long acting barbiturates,it has become clear that propofol infusion syndrome is animportant complication. This serious complication is char-acterized by refractory metabolic acidosis, cardiac failure,
rhabdomyolysis and renal failure, and occurs most often
with prolonged infusion at >5 mg/kg/h for >48 h, and pos-sibly traumatic or other acute brain injury ( Vasile et al.,
2003; Cremer et al., 2001 ).
Several centers, including ours, have taken to using IV
benzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam) in cases of NCSE. Thesemedications can be rapidly titrated due to their short halflives (similar to propofol), and may be used synergistically
with propofol to lower infused dosages and even result in a
lower mortality rate of 22% ( Rosetti et al., 2004 ). However,
in the rodent model of NCSs after acute MCA occlusion,benzodiazepines and barbiturates were found to be of nobeneﬁt for seizures, and barbiturates lead to continuousspiking in some animals ( Williams et al., 2004 ). Moreover,
in humans, one retrospective study compared critically illolder patients with NCSE treated aggressively in an ICU
setting with IV benzodiazepines to those with advance
directives treated less aggressively out of the ICU ( Littet al., 1998 ). The use of IV benzodiazepines was associated
with increased mortality despite no diﬀerence in severity ofillness. Aggressive ICU care in these patients prolongedhospitalization but did not lead to improved outcomes.
While the malignancy of NCSs remains debated, it is
clear that severe outcomes in critically ill patients with
NCSs are more aﬀected by other factors. Underlying etiol-
ogy and the length of ICU stay with its attendant mostlyinfectious complications are probably most important(Yaﬀe and Lowenstein, 1993 ). At our center, concerted
eﬀort is made to diagnose and treat NCSs as quickly aspossible but with minimal sedation so as to avoid prolong-ing coma and intubation. Non-coma inducing agents suchas IV fosphenytoin, valproate, and perhaps intermittent
benzodiazepines are used in addition to the oral AEDs
(via nasogastric tube) such as levetiracetam ( Rosetti and
Bromﬁeld, 2005 ) (now available intravenously as well)
and topiramate ( Towne et al., 2003 ).
5. Future directions
Clearly our understanding of how best to manage
patients with subclinical rhythmic or periodic EEG patternsis in its infancy. An important initial step to this end hasbegun with the proposal of standardized terminology forthese patterns last year ( Hirsch et al., 2005 ). Undoubtedly
further reﬁnement of this nomenclature will occur in the
future, and perhaps even some agreement on the deﬁnitionof a NCS. Deciding which EEG patterns are harmful, andhow aggressively cessation of this activity should be pur-sued, will only be established through large multicenter clin-ical trials. In the nearer future, some direction may resultfrom studying serial biomarkers (such as NSE) in thesepatients, imaging modalities (e.g. diﬀusion-weighted MRI,
MR spectroscopy, positron emission tomography) or
simultaneous cerebral microdialysis to gain insight intoalterations in metabolic stress and to determine frank neu-ronal injury associated with EEG changes.
Appendix A
Classiﬁcation of evidence (American Academy of Neu-
rology scheme, see Armon and Evans, 2005 ):
Class I: Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical
trial with masked outcome assessment in a representativepopulation. The following are required:
(a) Primary outcome(s) is(are) clearly deﬁned.
(b) Exclusion/inclusion criteria are clearly deﬁned.
(c) Adequate accounting for dropouts and crossovers
with numbers suﬃciently low to have minimal poten-tial for bias.
(d) Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and
substantially equivalent among treatment groups or
there is appropriate statistical adjustment for
diﬀerences.1668 J. Jirsch, L.J. Hirsch / Clinical Neurophysiology 118 (2007) 1660–1670Class II: Prospective matched group cohort study in a
representative population with masked outcome assess-ment that meets A through D above OR a randomized,controlled trial in a representative population that lacks
one criterion A through D.
Class III: All other controlled trials including well-
deﬁned natural history controls or patients serving asown controls in a representative population in which out-come assessment is independently assessed or indepen-dently derived by objective outcome measurement(objective outcome measurement is an outcome measurethat is unlikely to be aﬀected by an observer’s (patient,
treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias [e.g.
blood tests, administrative outcome data]).
Class IV: Evidence from uncontrolled studies, case ser-
ies, case reports, or expert opinion.
