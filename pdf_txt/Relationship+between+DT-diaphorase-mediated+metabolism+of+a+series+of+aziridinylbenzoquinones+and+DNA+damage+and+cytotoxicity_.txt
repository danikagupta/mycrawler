1. ABSTRACT
Aziridinyl quinones can be activated by cellular
reductases eg. DT-diaphorase and cytochrome P450
reductase to form highly reactive DNA alkylating agents.
The mechanisms by which this activation and alkylation
take place are many and varied. Using clinically relevant
and experimental agents this review will describe many of
these mechanisms. The agents discussed are Mitomycin C,
EO9 and analogues, diaziridinylbenzoquinones and the
pyrrolo[1,2 -alpha]benzimidazolequinones.
2. INTRODUCTION
The most characteristic feature of quinones is
their ease of reduction. Most naturally occurring quinones
have this common ability and indeed, the quinones
involved in photosynthesis and aerobic/anaerobic
glycolysis rely on this redox ability in order to transfer
electrons within the biochemical pathways. However, redox
cycling is also utilised by toxic quinones in fungi, plants,
bacteria and insects as part of elaborate defence and killing
strategies.
Redox cycling is a process wherein a quinone is
reduced by cellular reductases to form semiquinone
radicals or hydroquinones. These species can also react
with oxygen to form superoxide radicals and/or hydrogen
peroxide, which result in the production of several other
active oxygen species (1). The semiquinones of the anti-
cancer agents Doxorubicin, Mitomycin C and EO9 react
rapidly with oxygen to form superoxide radicals and there
is substantial evidence to show that these radical processes
can at least contribute to their cytotoxicities and, in the case
of Adriamycin and EO9, contribute to their dose limiting
toxicities.Simple quinones can also be toxic by virtue of
their ability to undergo Michael addition reactions with
cellular thiols (eg. the –SH groups of cysteine) and amines
(eg. the -NH 2 groups of lysine). It has been proposed that
some of the quinones that are formed from the oxidation of
certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be able to
undergo Michael additions with the bases of DNA.
However, this has yet to be proven.
The activity of simple alkylating agents can also
be enhanced by the inclusion of a quinone moiety. For
example, in a series of experiments comparing quinone
mustards with aniline mustards it was shown that a quinone
mustard can be more than 600 times more active against
L5178Y lymphoblasts than an aniline mustard (2). The
enhanced cytocidal activity could be correlated with the
formation of strand breaks and DNA-DNA cross links. It
was suggested that the inclusion of the quinone moiety
assists the compounds binding to DNA, presumably
through hydrogen bonding (3).
This review concentrates on the more complex
quinones whose biological activity is, or has been synthetically
enhanced by the addition of specific alkylating functions
capable of reacting with DNA. The main quinones discussed
are Mitomycin C, indoloquinones, aziridinylquinones and the
pyrrolo[1,2 -alpha]benzimidazolequinones (Figure 1).
3. DNA ALKYLATION
Despite the major advances that have occurred in
cancer research over the last ten years, the major
mechanism by which most of the clinically relevant anti-
cancer agents kill cells involves interfering with replication.DNA Alkylation  of aziridinylquinones

One of the simplest methods of bringing this about is via
alkylation of DNA. Essentially, alkylation is brought about
as the alkylating agent acts as an electrophilic trap for the
nucleophilic sites in DNA. Alkylation invariably occurs on
guanines or adenosines as these are the most easily
oxidised bases and are the best nucleophiles. For most
simple alkylating agents, the N-7 position of guanine in the
major groove is the preferred site of alkylation. This is the
most negative site anywhere within the bases of DNA.
However, with more complex agents, the sites of alkylation
can be controlled by non-covalent DNA interactions.
Simple mono-alkylation of DNA results in many
types of damage including mismatching of DNA base pairs,
the production of apurinic sites and the formation of single
strand breaks. Bisalkylation of the DNA helix can lead to
inter-strand, intra-strand, inter-helix or DNA-protein cross
links. It is generally recognised that the inter-strand cross-
links are the most toxic as they can prevent strand
separation during DNA replication and are difficult to
repair due to the involvement of both DNA strands.
Some of these concepts can be illustrated with the
clinically relevant quinone anti-tumour agents.
3.1. Mitomycin C.
Mitomycin C and other mitomycins are isolated
from various strains of Streptomyces  and in particular,
Streptomyces caespitosus . Mitomycin C is the best known
of all the aziridinylquinones and, at the present time, is the
most clinically relevant. Essentially, this drug has three
potentially active constituents. These are the quinone, an
unusual aziridine, and a C-10 carbamate group. Several
studies have shown that all three constituents are utilised in
the cytotoxic action of Mitomycin C, although the
mechanisms of activation are complex and are still being
debated.
Mitomycin C is very stable a physiological pH
but becomes unstable on reduction by chemical reducing
agents or reductive enzymes. Although it is widely
accepted that Mitomycin C has to undergo reduction in
order to interact with DNA, there has been some
controversy as to which enzymes are responsible for thisprocess. Until recently, it was believed that the cytotoxicity
of Mitomycin C was solely due to the formation of reactive
semiquinones produced by the one-electron reducing
enzymes. Several different groups also produced evidence
to show that Mitomycin C is not a substrate for the
obligatory two-electron reducing enzyme, DT-diaphorase.
It was therefore proposed that the hydroquinone plays no
part in the activation of the quinone (4-6). Similarly, earlier
studies had shown that a reactive species can be produced
by “selective one-electron reduction” by chemical agents or
different one-electron reducing enzymes. Again, the
implication from these studies was that the hydroquinone
played no part in the cytotoxic mechanisms (7,8).
However, the precise roles of the one- or two-
electron reducing enzymes in the activation of Mitomycin
C became more confused when it was shown that the
hydroquinone, formed from the dismutation of the
semiquinones, yields similar products to those produced
from the different one-electron reducing systems (9).
Furthermore, it has now been proven that Mitomycin C is a
substrate for DT-diaphorase (10) and indeed, the
cytotoxicity of Mitomycin C in different cell lines can be
correlated with the intracellular levels of this enzyme (11).
Several types of Mitomycin-base adducts have
been isolated and the main site of attack is at guanines with
about 90% of the adducts at the N-2 position. A guanine
N2-/guanine N-2 cross linked adduct has been isolated
from mouse mammary tumours following Mitomycin C
treatment (12, 13).
Figure 2 shows a reaction scheme that
summarises an accepted mechanism for the activation of
Mitomycin C (adapted from 14). In this scheme, the
hydroquinone (B) can be formed either by
disproportionation of the semiquinones or by direct
reduction by DT-diaphorase. This hydroquinone forms
reactive intermediates (C) and (D). The quinone methide
(D) reacts with DNA to produce mainly adducts at the N-2
position of guanine in the minor groove. In the absence of
DNA, the main products produced are the cis- and trans -
forms of 2,7 diamino-1-hydroxymitosene (E) and 2,7-
diaminomitosene (F). More recent studies have shown that
at pH 5.8, where the rate of reduction by DT-diaphorase is
much faster than at pH 7.4, the yield of cross links
increases 6-20 fold. Furthermore, major groove 2,7-
diaminomitosene adducts are produced (15). These adducts
have also been detected after Mitomycin C treatment in
vivo (16). The monofunctional and bifunctional activation
pathways are controlled by the state of protonation of the
leuco-aziridinomitosene (B).
3.2. EO9
EO9 [3-hydroxy-5-aziridinyl-1-methyl-2-(1H-
indole-4,7-indione)-prop-2-en- 1-ol] (Figure 1b R 1 =
aziridinyl X 1 = X2 = OH) was originally synthesised as part
of a large study which involved the synthesis of Mitomycin
C analogues based around indoloquinones (17). EO9 was
selected for clinical study because of its activity against
hypoxic cells and its apparent lack of bone marrow toxicity
in animal studies (18). This quinone was also shown to be aDNA Alkylation  of aziridinylquinones
174Figure 2.  Some of the proposed mechanisms for activation and DNA cross-linking of Mitomycin C.
good substrate for DT-diaphorase and the reduced products
damaged DNA (19).
The indoloquinones were initially designed to
alkylate DNA after reduction via the formation of a
reactive methide species (Figure 3). These methide species
are formed by an inter-molecular rearrangement of the
hydroquinone form resulting in the elimination of the two
leaving groups, X (C). Mechanistic studies have shown that
the C-10 substituted hydroxymethyl group forms alkylation
products more readily than the substituted propenol group
(17). EO4 (Figure 1b, R 1 = aziridinyl X 1 = X 2 =
OC(O)CH 3) has been shown to readily cross-link DNA
after reduction (20) and it is likely that this cross link is
formed by the aziridine and C-10 methyl groups. In the
same study, reduced EO9 did not form such cross links.
This could be consistent with the fact that EO9 has no
obvious leaving groups to facilitate methide formation and
hence would be expected to only form mono-adducts via
the aziridine group. However, another study has
demonstrated that reduced EO9 forms cross links in
plasmid DNA and in intact cells (21).
The DNA cross linking studies on EO9 in intact DT-
diaphorase rich cells were carried out using the alkaline
elution technique. However, this same study showed that
these cross links were almost completely hidden by the
presence of extensive DNA strand breaks (21). This isconsistent with another study which showed that the
hydroquinone of EO9 is unstable in the presence of oxygen
and readily autoxidises producing hydrogen peroxide (22).
This simple redox cycling can therefore explain the DNA
strand breaks and may explain why EO9 shows an
excellent correlation between its cytotoxicity and the
intracellular levels of DT-diaphorase in different cell lines
(11). EO9 has undergone Phase I/II clinical trials but has
shown no response. The major toxicity was reversible
proteinuria (23).
3.3. Diaziridinylbenzoquinones.
The diaziridinylbenzoquinones are structurally the
simplest of all the aziridinylquinones but have given rise to
some of the more interesting studies on quinone-DNA
interactions. There have been four major studies carried out on
aziridinylbenzoquinones, each involving extensive synthesis
followed by biological evaluation and all producing a
candidate for clinical evaluation. 2,5-Diaziridinyl-1,4-
benzoquinone (Figure 1C; R 1 = R 2 = H) and many of the
simpler analogues were originally synthesised by Petersen and
co-workers in the early fifties (24). The most extensively
studied analogue was Trenimon (Figure 1C; R 1 = H R 2 =
aziridinyl) which underwent clinical trials in Poland, Italy and
Germany for the treatment of leukaemias, breast cancers,
Hodgkins disease and carcinomas of the cervix. However,
Trenimon was removed from the clinic due to its tendency to
cause  myelosuppresion (25).N NOCH3ONH2O

formation of EO analogues via a reactive quinone methide
intermediate (C).
In the early seventies, Nakao and co-workers
synthesised a series of benzoquinones in order to mimic the
alkylating ability of the carbamate side chain of Mitomycin
C. It was found that the diaziridinyl analogues of these
quinones were very active against mice bearing L1210
tumours. More than forty diaziridinylbenzoquinones were
then synthesised by this group (26). These quinones
included both carbamate and alkyl- substituted analogues.
This resulted in the identification of Carboquone (Figure
1C; R 1 = Me R 2 = CH(OCH 3)CH2OCONH 2) as a potential
clinical candidate. This quinone is still used today in
combination therapy in Japan for the treatment of prostate
cancer (27) and in Finland for the treatment of ovarian
cancer (28). Once again, the major side effect is
myelosuppresion (29).
In the late 1970s, Driscoll and co-workers
designed a series of diaziridinylquinones as potential
central nervous system anti-tumour agents. These were
designed to be able to cross the blood brain barrier due to
their high lipid solubility and low ionisation. The most
active compound identified was AZQ (Figure 1C; R 1 = R 2
= NHCO 2Et) which was effective against both inter-
peritoneally and inter-cerebrally implanted tumours (30). A
more water soluble analogue, BZQ (Figure 1C, R 1 = R 2 =
NHC 2H4OH), was also identified from these studies (31).
Both AZQ and BZQ entered clinical trials although BZQ is
not reduced by the one-electron reducing enzymes and is
not a substrate for DT-diaphorase (32). AZQ has undergone
phase II trials against recurrent primary brain tumour (33)
and advanced large bowel cancer (34). BZQ did not
proceed past phase I trials.
The interest in diaziridinylquinones was further
increased after it was recognised that DT-diaphorase is over
expressed in several different types of tumours (35) and
some diaziridinylquinones are excellent substrates for this
enzyme (32, 36). These studies identified MeDZQ (Figure
1C; R 1 = R 2 = CH 3) as an excellent substrate for the
enzyme and the hydroquinone is very efficient at cross
linking DNA. More recently, a water soluble analogue,
RH1 (Figure 1C; R 1= -CH 3, R2 = -CH 2OH), has beendeveloped (37) which compared to MeDZQ, is a better
substrate for DT-diaphorase, a more efficient DNA cross-
linking agent and shows high cytotoxicity differentials in
DT-diaphorase-rich and –deficient cell lines. On the basis
of these and other results, RH1 has been accepted for Phase
I/II clinical trials.
The selectivity of a quinone for specifically targeting DT-
diaphorase rich cells depends on a number of factors and in
particular, on the relative rates of reduction of the quinone
by the one-electron reducing enzymes. However,
fortunately, the rates of reduction by the one-electron
reducing enzymes tend to be strongly dependent on the
one-electron reduction potentials of the quinone (eg. 38).
Hence, if a quinone is thermodynamically more easy to
reduce (ie. the value of E[Q/Q.-] is more positive), it will be
easily reduced by the enzyme. This means that the rates at
physiologically relevant concentrations are not dependent
on the enzyme-substrate binding. Recent studies in our
laboratory have so far shown that this is not true for the
reductions by DT-diaphorase. It would appear that binding
of the quinone to the enzyme is necessary for the two-
electron transfer and the K m values for many quinones are
very low. Thus for example, when a series of alkyl
substituted diaziridinylquinones were tested as substrates
for the purified enzyme, no simple correlations with rates
could be observed, despite the fact that their two electron
reduction potentials (Q/Q2-) were similar (36). Similarly,
AZQ has a relatively positive two-electron reduction
potential but is a very poor substrate for DT-diaphorase
compared to MeDZQ, which has a much more negative
two-electron potential.
All aziridinyl compounds, can be activated to
alkylate DNA by protonation of the aziridine groups
followed by nucleophilic attack. Indeed, it was
demonstrated several years ago, that simple
aziridinylbenzoquinones in aqueous solution can cross-link
DNA in the absence of reduction and this process is pH
dependant (39). This “acid assisted” activation process is
probably the main mechanism for DNA alkyation by the
aziridinyl compounds which are easily protonated such as
Triethylenemelamine, thioTEPA and BZQ.
The quinones which can undergo bioreduction
have the added advantage in that in many cases, although
the pK for the aziridines in the quinone are around 3-4, the
pK increases to around 5-6 when the quinone is reduced.
Thus for example, the pK of Mitomycin C is 3.1 whereas
the pK of the hydroquinone is around 5 (9). This means that
DNA alkylation will only significantly occur after the
quinone has been reduced and hence allows selectivity.
The known mechanisms whereby the
diaziridinylquinones can damage DNA are shown in Figure
4. The efficiency of DNA cross linking by the
diaziridinylquinones depends on the reactivity of the
second aziridine group after the first aziridine has alkylated
at one site on the DNA. This should be a very favourable
process simply because as the first aziridine will form an
aliphatic amine on alkylation. The resulting electron
donation from this amine into the hydroquinone/DNA Alkylation  of aziridinylquinones

semiquinone can react with oxygen; E + O 2 → A + O 2.-
semiquinone aromatic ring system should then lower the
pK of the remaining aziridine. In this manner, this aziridine
will have a lower pK than the first aziridine and hence
should more readily react with the bases. The efficiency of
cross linking also depends on the relative positions of these
aziridines.
Although the diaziridinylquinones are relatively
simple compounds, their interactions with the bases of
DNA can be quite complex and are strongly dependent on
the structure of the quinone. For example, alkylation by
many diaziridinylquinones is primarily at the guanine N-7
positions with a preference for guanines within runs of
continuous guanines (40). This sequence selectivity is
similar to that seen with several other types of bifunctional
alkylating agents such as the nitrogen mustards (41). In
contrast, DZQ following reduction, alkylates at N-7
primarily at 5’-GC sequences, and in particular at 5’-TGC
sites (42,43). Without reduction, this sequence selectivity is
not observed. The reduced DZQ was shown to
preferentially cross link DNA at these 5’-TGC-3’
sequences with the cross link spanning two base pairs. In
contrast, reduced MeDZQ cross linked preferentially at 5’-
GNC-3’ sequences with the cross link between guanine N-7
positions spanning three base pairs (43).
In the case of DZQ, the hydroquinone can
initially intercalate between the bases of a 5'-GC-3'sequence to form hydrogen bonds with the O-2 and the C4-
NH2 groups of the cytosine. This positioning also allows
the protonated aziridine to associate with the N-7 of
guanine (44). The 5'-TGC-3' selectivity can be explained by
the crystallographic results from Dickerson and colleagues
(45,46). Essentially, a 5'-GC-3' sequence as opposed to a 5'-
CG-3' is preferred as the GC step has a high twist profile.
This means that the sequence has a high twist, a low rise, a
positive cup and a negative roll. The positive cup ensures
that there is more room in the centre space between the
base pairs and the negative roll means that these bases are
tilted open towards the major groove. Thus the GC step is a
more open site of attack (Figure 5A). A CG step has a low
twist profile with a negative cup and a positive roll and is
thus more compact. The extension of the sequence to 5'-
TGC-3', and hence 5'-GCA-3' on the complimentary strand,
can be explained by the occurrence of three centre
hydrogen bonds between adjacent base pairs in the major
groove. These were found to frequently occur at CA steps
(45). The occurrence of one of these bonds in a 5'-TGC-3'
sequence causes the middle cytosine on the complementary
strand to be pulled further up making the space between the
GC step even larger (see Figure 5A). Following these initial
interactions, the aziridines can alkylation at the two
guanine N-7 positions and therefore cross link the DNA.
From comparisons with other diaziridinylquinones, it was
shown that the 5'-TGC-3' selectivity only occurs when
there is a simple –H in position-6 of the quinones. This wasO

A) The open nature of the GC step and the three centre hydrogen bond allows the hydroquinone form of DZQ to enter and form
hydrogen bonds between the OH groups, and the O-2 and the C4-NH 2 groups of cytosine. The protonated aziridine associates
with the N-7 of guanine on the same strand. B) The initial interactions between MeDZQ hydroquinone and DNA. The dotted

explained by the fact that a simple –H group is small and
can allow the hydroquinone to enter and intercalate
between the GC bases (44).
It has also been shown that when one of the
aziridinyl groups in diaziridinylquinones is replaced by a
methyl or another small alkyl group, cross linking DNA
still takes place at the 5'-TGC-3' sequences (47). Hence for
example, reduced 2-aziridinyl-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone
cross links DNA at these sequences. Furthermore, the
cross-linking ability is decreased when the methyl group is
replaced with an ethyl or propyl group. It has been
proposed that the cross linking occurs as a consequence of
the formation of a quinone methide species. Essentially, the
hydroquinones initially intercalate at the 5'-TGC-3'
sequence, in a similar way to the hydroquinone of DZQ.
The aziridine then alkylates at one guanine N-7. As there is
no other aziridine to alkylate the opposite guanine, the
hydroquinone can then slowly autoxidise back to a
quinone. This quinone then tautomerizes to form the
reactive quinone methide species which alkylates this
guanine. The loss of activity when the methyl group is
changed to an ethyl or propyl is attributed to steric
hindrance in the initial intercalation (47).
The mechanism for the 5'-GNC-3' sequence
selective cross-linking of MeDZQ is relatively simple (36).
As MeDZQ does not have a hydrogen at position-6 of the
quinone, it is unable to initially intercalate into DNA. The
hydroquinone of MeDZQ therefore interacts face on with
DNA to form hydrogen bonds between the two
hydroquinone OH groups and the two guanine O-6s and the
protonated aziridines associate with the two guanine N-7
positions. These hydrogen bonds hold the drug in place
while the aziridines react to form a cross-link between the
two guanines (Figure 5B). Once again, if both of the methyl
groups are replaced by ethyl or propyl, the cross linking
efficiency decrease as these larger alkyl groups sterically
hinder the initial hydrogen bonding interactions.
The sequence selectivity of all thesediaziridinylquinones position the aziridines in such a way
that they can hydrogen bond to guanines on opposite
strands of the helix. This merely increases the efficiency of
cross linking and this can be related to their enhanced
cytotoxicities in different cell lines. This sequence
selectivity is very short and is certainly not long enough to
target unique sequences in the human genome. However,
recent advances have shown that the sequence selective of
alkylating diaziridinylquinones can be extended by
conjugation of the quinone to an oligonucleotide (48). In
this study a 21 base pair triplex was formed using a
MeDZQ analogue. This large analogue was able to
selectively cross link a designed target DNA at a 24 base
pair sequence.
3.4. Pyrollo[1,2 -alpha]benzimidazolequinones
The pyrollo[1,2 -alpha]benzimidazolequinones
(PBIs) are the most recently designed group of
aziridinylquinones. These types of quinones interact with
the major groove of DNA, like the diaziridinylquinones,
but they target the alkylation to the phosphate backbone
rather than the bases. The reduced forms of the PBIs
hydrogen bond to the DNA bases and hold the drug in the
major groove. These bonds fix the aziridine group in the
correct location to allow alkylation of the phosphate
backbone and result in the formation of a phosphotriester
(49). These phosphotriesters are hydrolytically labile and
produce DNA strand breaks (Figure 6).
The base pair specificity of PBIs can be altered
through small structural changes at the 3 position of the
molecule (Figure 1D). These structural changes can vastly
alter the hydrogen bond donating/accepting ability of the
PBIs and thus affect the interactions with the bases in
DNA. For example, when position 3 is occupied by a
carbamate (Figure 1D; Z = OC(O)NH 2) an amine (Z =
NH2) or a ureido (Z = NHC(O)NH 2) group, the alkylation
occurs at A-T bases. Alternatively, a carbonyl group at
position 3 (Z = O) results in an alkylation at G-C bases
whereas alkylation at both A-T and G-C sites can beDNA Alkylation  of aziridinylquinones

observed for acetyl group (Z= OC(O)CH 3). Interestingly,
the analogues wherein the aziridine is replaced by an
acetamido group have been found to be potent
topoisomerase inhibitors. The PBIs are therefore extremely
interesting compounds and several clinical candidates have
been put forward (50).
4. PERSPECTIVE
There are a number of varied mechanisms by
which aziridinyl quinones can interact with and alkylate
DNA. Increased understanding of these mechanisms allows
the development of new agents and also allows the
redevelopment and improvement of previously utilised
agents. This review has outlined many of these mechanisms
and illustrates the advances made in this area of drug
development.
