ABSTRACT
Bacterial consortia BMP1 ( containing six isolates), BMP2 (three isolates) and BBP (three isolate s) were isolated from
textileaffectedsoil, sludge and effluent ofHudiara drain in vicinity of Nishat Mills Limited 5Km Off -22Km Ferozepur
Road Lahore, Pakistan. The seconsortia were capable of degrading re d, green, black and yellow dyes and were resistant
to heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Cr,Ni,Mn&Pb). They were equally beneficial for the reduction of other pollution parameters
likecolour, pH, EC, nitrogen, phosphorus, chloride, COD, BOD, TDS and TSS from textile effluents. The
physicochemical characteriza tion of textile effluents was carried out before and after treatment by consortia to sort out
most efficient consortium .The results indicated that the consortium BMP1 showed maximum reduction of EC(52.98%) ,
pH(11.85%), nitrogen (79.02%) , phosphorus (68.78%), chloride (46.42%) , BOD(59.49%), COD(61.35%) , TDS
(44.93%) and TSS (52.58%). Itwas also helful in reduction of heavy metals such as Cu(92.3%), Cd(89.46%), Cr
(83.52%), Ni(80.7%), Mn(88.3%)andPb(93.5%). Effect of untreated and treated textile effluents was investigated on
maize(Zea mays L. CV C1415) and it was observed that effluent treated by consortium BMP1 was not toxic to maize
cropin comparison to untreated effluent .Thecurrentstudyrevealed that utilization of bacterial consortium for textile
effluent treatment could be an effective method.
Key words: Textileeffluent, bioremediation, maize, bacterial consortia.
INTRODUCTION
Textile industries consume large quantities of
waterand generate huge amounts of effluents which
contain considerable amount of suspended solids,
additives, detergents, surfactants, carcinogenic amines,
aldehydes,heavy metals and dyes. Fluctuating pH, high
temperature, COD and complex coloration are main
physiochemical characters of textile effluents; they pose
serious environmental threats to receiving water bodies
(Jadhavet al.,2010; Phugare et al.,2011).Colour is the
first contaminant to be recognized in textile effluent as
themajor contributor of biological oxygen demand
(Murugalatha et al.,2010).Among commonly used dyes
azo dyes are difficultto decolorize because of their
complex structure and synthetic origin. The azo
anthraquinone, sulfur, in digoid, triphenylmethyl and
phthalocyanine derivatives are the most frequently used
dyes on industrial scal e.Biodegradation of azo dyes is
possible if the azo bond is ﬁrstreduced. Permanent
decolorization of the azo compounds occurred on
cleavage of azo bond but the intermediates can be re
oxidized to colored by products. Majority of these dyes
are toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and stable to light and
temperature. Thes e resistant properties inhibit the attack
of microorganisms. Removal of such dyes is a matter of
serious concern (Barkaet al.,2011;Onget al.,2012).The process of biodegradation is relatively
inexpensive, running costs are low and the end products
ofcomplete mineralization are non toxic. Most reduction
occurs during active bacterial growth. There is a growing
concern regarding adverse effects on aquatic biota and
humans due to the contamination of water by textile
effluents(Saratale et al.,2009; Ca rneiroet al.,2010).
Important component of dyes is heavy metals, which are
frequently found in textile effluent infree ionic or
complex compound state. When these heavy metals
reached the water bodies they settle down inthe sediment
and accumulate in b odies of aquatic organisms on
inhalation thus causing serious health impacts leading to
the death of those organisms (Phugare et al.,2011).Land
irrigated with textile effluent scausesserious impacts on
plant growth as soil can act as a sink for heavy me tals and
other resistant chemicals results in the reduction of
productivity . Metalsleaching cause contamination of
ground water. These contaminants entered in the food
chainand become health risk for plants, animals and
human (Ross ,1994). Howeve r treated textile effluent can
be a good source of irrigation water. Investigation of
pollutants and their impacts on plant growth could be of
prime importance as plants are commercial products of
agrarian society (Jadhavet al.,2010).
The removal of pollutants is the major task of
bioremediation. Mostly a simple one step process is not
possible; usually a sequence of biological transformations
is needed to eliminate particular substance. TheseThe Journal of Animal & Plant Sciences, 23( 4): 2013, Page: 1193 -1199

1194sequenced steps are pos sible by developing a microbial
community called consortium comprising populations
with particular bio -transformation activities. It may
happenwith other processes of bioremediation that in the
chain of reactions the intermediate canbe more harmful
thanpollutant. If the rate of transformation is slower, the
harmful intermediate will be accumulated and the process
fails to meet expected results (Drobnõk ,1999).
After wheat and rice, maize is the third most
important cereal in Pakistan. It is used for bot h human
and animal consumption. Due to photo -thermo-
insensitive character, it is grown round the year; this
quality makes it ‘queen of cereal’. In Pakistan, area of
1.016 million hectares is under cultivation of maize.
Approximately 66% of the maize cultiv ation is carried
out in irrigated area and the rem aining in rain -fed area
(Tariq and Iqbal, 2010; Verma et al.,2012).
In the current study isolation and screening of
the indigenous bacteria was carried out from textile
effluent contaminated sites and bacterial consortia were
developed to reduce the pollution parameters from textile
effluents. Effect of untreated and treated textile effluent s
was investigated on Zea mays L. (Maize).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection :Wastewater (Textile effluents) ,
sludge and affectedsoil samples were collected in screw
capped sterilized bottles from Hudiara drain near Nishat
Mills Limited 5Km Off -22Km Ferozepur Road Lahore,
Pakistan. One sample of soil, four sludge and four
samples of waste water were collected f rom 0, 5,500 and
1000 meter away from the main outlet following standard
procedures (APHA ,2005).
Isolation, screening and identification of the
indigenous bacteria :The isolation of indigenous
bacteria was carried out through serial dilution method
fromaffectedsoil, sludge and textile effluent on nutrient
agar medium ( Jadhavet al.,2010; Kauret al.,2010).
Isolated bacterial strains were screened out by incubating
them on nutrient agar medium containing red (Carmine)
green (Ligh t Green) black (Erichrome Black T) and
yellow (Metanil Yellow) dyes 200ppm of each. They
were also incubated on nutrient agar containing 50 ppm
of Cu, Cd, Cr,Ni,MnandPb each. The stock cultures of
screened bacterial isolates were maintained routinely o n
the nutrient agar medium and stored at 4oC.The
screened bacterial strains were identified on
morphological, biochemical and physiological properties
using the protocol given in Bergey’s Manual of
Determinative Bacteriology (Holt et al.,1994).
Decolorization:Decolorization a bility of bacterial
isolates was analyzed by using spectrophotometer
(SpectroScan 80D UV –VIS)at optimum wavelength. The
decolorization activity was expressed in terms ofpercentage decolorization using formula of Cheriaa et al.
(2012):
t0–tf
Decolorization % = ---------------------- x 100
t0
Where;
(t0) = initial absorbance
(tf) = absorbance at incubation time
Development of bacterial consortia :The isolates for the
consortium development were selected based on criteria;
ability todegrade the dyes efficiently above60% within 3
daysand also with ability to degrade red, green, black
and yellow dyes , and also can grow on media containing
at least 50ppm of Cu ,Cd,Cr,Ni,MnandPb.Following
three consortia were developed usi ng combinations of six
(Consortium BMP1) and three isolates(Consortium
BMP2, Consortium BBP) . A loopful of selected isolates
was individually inoculated for 24 h to form a consortium
(Tonyet al.,2009).1.Consortium BMP1: Bacillus
subtilus, Bacillus ce reus, Bacillus mycoides ,Bacillus sp ,
Pseudomonas sp.andMicrococcus sp. 2.Consortium
BMP2:Bacillus sp Micrococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp3.
Consortium BBP:Bacillus cereus, Bacillus mycoides,
Pseudomonas sp.
Physicochemical characterization of textile ef fluents:
Characterization of the effluent forvarious parameters
such as temperature, colour, pH, EC, nitrogen (N),
phosphorus (P), chloride (Cl),chemical oxygen demand
(COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total
dissolved soilids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS) and
heavy metal s(Cu,Cd,Cr,Ni,Mn&Pb)was carried out
before and after treatment by bacterial consortia to
measure reduction in these parameters (Aliet al.,2009).
Maximum resistant limits to heavy metals :The
maximum resistant limits t o heavy metals of bacterial
isolateswasdetermined by using solution of 50ppm,
100ppm, 150ppm, 200ppm 400ppm, 500ppm, 1000ppm,
1200ppm, 1400ppm, 1600ppm and 1800ppm solutions of
deferentmetal salts (copper sulphate, cadmium chloride,
potassium dichromate ,nickel,manganese chloride and
lead nitrate ).Themaximum resistant limits for the
bacterial isolates were checked by increasing the
concentration of respective metal stepwise (Guoet al.,
2010).
Effect of treated and untreated textile effluent on
maize:In order to assess the effect of treated and
untreated textile effluent on maize (common agricultural
crop of Pakistan), the tests were performed on Zea mays
L. CV C1415. Thetextile effluent treated by consortium
BMP 1 was used .The study was carried ou t at room
temperature (20 seeds were placed in each germination
plate) by watering 5 ml of untreated and treated textile
effluents. Control set was carried out using irrigation
water at the same time. The trial was laid out inMahmood et al., J. Anim. Plant Sci. 23( 4):2013
1195Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three
replications .Germination (%) as well as the length of
plumule and radical was recorded after 7 days (Saratale et
al.,2009).
Statistical a nalysis:Data were analy zed by one -way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) using software package
Co-stat version 3.03 (Steelet al.,1997).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Physicoche mical characterization of textile effluents :
Theeffluents collected from Nishat Mills Limited were
brownish black in color,pungentsmell,high temperature
(35.6OC)andalkalinepH(8.66).Electricconductivity of
effluents was5.78ms/cm,indicating the high amount of
dissolve salts. TS S(3920 mg/l) and TDS (4960 mg/l)
werequite high .Nitrogen, phosphorus, chloride and
surface tension of the textile effluents were 16mg/l,
5.4mg/l, 273mg/l and 71.16mN/m ,respectively. A high
load ofCOD(1219mg/l)and BOD (370mg/l)wasalso
observed.The analysis for heavy metals showed high
amount as compared to National Environmental Quality
Standards (NEQS 2000) .The average amount (ppm)of
metallikeCu,Cd,Cr,Ni,MnandPbwas8.54,0.59,
2.34, 1.12, 3.87 and 0.62 ,respectively (Table 1).
The high levels of COD in the textile effluents
indicated the toxicity level of pollution (Dawkar et al.,
2010) which is very harmful for the whole ecology of
aquatic ecosystem of the receiving bodies. The reduction
in COD and BOD after treatment with consortium BMP1
was consequent of the removal of organic load from
effluent and ultimately the toxicity (Ong et al.,2012).
The exceeded permissible limits of polluti on parameters
reduced the natural process of bioremediation. The
concentration of the solids in textile effluent was another
matter of concern and the carcinogenic effect of the dyes
adds to it. The results of the present study indicated that
the consortiu m BMP1 can be used for the treatment of
such waters. Reduction in the concentration of TDS and
TSS were near fifty percent due to degradation of these
solids by the bacteria present in the consortium. The
results were in correlation with those as observed in other
studies(Aliet al.,2009; Kumar et al.,2010).
Decolorization and maximum resistant limits of
bacterial isolates against heavy metals :It was observed
that bacterial isolates showed remarkable behavior for the
degradation of dyes present in texti le effluents. The
maximum decolorization for red, green, black and yellow
dyes byBacillus mycoides was 74%, 76%, 73% and 76%
respectively while for Bacillus cereus was 76%, 75%,
74% and 74 % respectively. Bacillus subtilus decolorized
(%)red, green, black and yellow dyes up to77, 78, 79
and 79. TheMicrococcus sp. was responsible of
decolorizing the red, green, black and yellow dyes to
75%, 71%, 73% and 77% respectively .ThePseudomonassp.showed decolorizing of red, green, black and yellow
dyes up to 79 %, 76%, 77% and 78% respectively (Table
2).A great deal of resistance was shown by the bacterial
isolates,whenincubated on nutrient agar havingdifferent
concentration s ofheavymetals.Bacillus mycoides
showed maximum resistant limit 150ppm, 100ppm,
200ppm, 100ppm, 50ppm and 500ppm for Cu,Cd,Cr,Ni,
Mn and Pb respectively. Similarly Bacillus cereus
showed200ppm for Crand PbwhileBacillus sp. and
Micrococcus sp. were maximum resistant at 1000ppm Pb.
WhileBacillus subtilus showed maximum resistant limit
at1000ppm for Cr .ThePseudomonas sp.had maximum
resistant limit (1600ppm) forCr which was higher than
other heavy metals (Table 2). This remarkable difference
in maximum resistant limit is due to variation in their
enzymatic activities (Ali et al.,2009).
Effect of selected consortia on reductio n of pollutants :
The results indicate d that consortium BMP1 show
remarkable behavior towards the reduction of pollution
parameters than other two consortia. The consortium
BMP1reduced EC, pH ,nitrogen, p hosphorus, chloride ,
BOD, COD, TDS and TSS up to 52.98%, 11.85%,
79.02%, 68.78% ,46.42%, 59.49%, 61.35%, 44.93% and
52.58% respectively. While consortium BMP2 exhibited
39.41%, 8.03%, 73.19%, 64.321%, 41.01%, 48.53%,
51.15%,35.79% and 43.22%   reduction for EC, pH ,
nitrogen, phosphorus, chloride, BOD, COD, TDS and
TSS respectively. Similarly consortium BBP also
exhibited 46.23%,9.58%,75.37%,67.11%,44.12%,
54.71%, 56.28%,40.31% and48.88%   reduction for EC,
pH,nitrogen, phosphorus, chloride, BOD, CO D, TDS
and TSS respectively (Figure 1) .The bacterial consortia
BMP1, BMP2 andBBPwere developed from isolates of
textile effluents, sludge and affectedsoil ofNishat Mills
Ltd.Lahore, Pakistan. The bacterial consortia BMP1,
BMP2andBBP found to have s ignificant potential on
decolorization of the textile effluent. The venture of
present study was to evaluate the use of a biological
treatment by developing bacterial consortia for
decolorization and reduction of pollution parameters from
textile effluent. The reason for effective decolorization of
the effluent by consortia might be associated with the
combined metabolic activities and interactions of these
bacterial isolates. The results of the current study were
comparable to the research conducted by Jos hiet al.
(2010) and Kaur et al.(2010).
Heavy metal reduction ability of various consortia in
textile effluents :The consortium BMP1 reduced Cu ,Cd,
Cr,Ni,MnandPbup to92.3%, 89.46%, 83.52%, 80.7%,
88.3% and 93.5% respectively. Consortium BBP was als o
able to reduce 77.5%, 64.6%, 71.2%, 68.9%, 81.7% and
81.1% of Cu ,Cd,Cr,Ni,MnandPb respectively. While
consortium BMP2 showed low % reduction than both
consortia discussed above. It reduced (%)Cu,Cd,Cr,Ni,Mahmood et al., J. Anim. Plant Sci. 23( 4):2013
1196MnandPbup to66.4,54.8,60.2,51.3,67.2and62.4,
respectively (Fig. 2).
Among the three consortia only consortium
BPM 1 was able to reduce the Cu ,Cd,Cr,Ni,MnandPb
up to permissible limits (Table 3).Theconsortium BPM
1can be exploited for the bioremediation of Cu,Cd,Cr,
Ni,MnandPbcontaining wastes, since it seems to have a
potential to reduce up topermissible limits .The usage of
higher amount of metal containing dyes for dying process
contribute high metal concentration in textile effluent,
which causes a lot of problems associated with human
and ecosystem health. A variety of mechanisms exist for
the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution by
bacteria, fungi, algae, macrophytes and higher plants. The
bacterial response to the presence of metals includes
processes s uch as biosorption, active cell transport and
enzymatic binding (Rehman et al.,2008, Zahoor and
Rehman, 2009, Shakoori et al.,2010).Efficiency of
consortia might be associated with different specificity of
the metals towards biding sites present on the bacterial
cells. Hence all the bacterial consortia not only exhibited
the ability to survive in contaminated textile effluent
(Guoet al.,2010) but also demonstrated remediation of
toxic heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Cr,Ni,Mn&Pb). The
consortium BMP1 represe nted a marked increase in
bioremediation of Cu, Cd, Cr,Ni,Mn&Pb.It might be
due to the proteins induced during stress period (Nies,
2003).  Therefore bacterial consortium BMP1 can be
used for the bioremediation of Cu, Cd, Cr,Ni,Mn&Pb
containing ef fluent, since it seems to have a potential to
reduce these toxic heavy metals.
Effect of treated and untreated textile effluent on
Maize:The water bodies used for irrigation purposes
contain untreated effluent from dyeing industry. This
practice is of gre at environmental concern as it associated
with biotic and ecosystem health. Soil fertility is directly
and indirectly dependent o nirrigation water.
Biodegradation of effluent leads to generation of various
products. Therefore it is virtually important to study the
toxicity impact of these degradation products on plants.
Treated and untreated textile effluents were applied onZea mays L.to study their effect on seed germination and
seedling health .The plumule and radical length for
controlwere 20±0.64 an d 6±0.96 cm, respectively,
whereas germination was 100% (Figure 3) .The
germination was inhibited to 39%,while plumule and
radical length was up to 6cm and 2cm respectively
(Figure 4) .When textile effluent treated by consortium
BMP1was applied ,thegermination was 94% while
plumule and radical length was 13cm and 5cm
respectively, it was very near to control. The results of
the present study illustrated the signi ﬁcant difference in
lengths of plumule and radical of the Zea mays L. CV
C1415grown in the irrigation water (control) and textile
effluent. Plant germination and growth are the techniques
used to evaluate the effect of treated and untreated textile
effluent. Germination has been regarded as a less
sensitive method than plumule and radical length

the present study suggested that textile effluents were
toxic and treated with consortium BMP1 were non -toxic
to a common crop of Punjab, Pakistan such as maize ( Zea
maysL. CV C1 415). The ultimate aim of bioremediation
and biodegradation was to reduce the concentration of
environmental pollutant as well as its toxicity. The
present study and literature indicated that the textile
effluent exert strong effects germination, plumule a nd
radical length of maize (Saratale et al.,2009; Phugare et
al.,2011).

Conclusions :NishatTextileMills Limited effluents are
clearly impa rting a high load of dyes and heavy metals
intoHudiara drain. The bacterial conso rtiawereusedfor
the bioremediation of heavy metals ( Cu, Cd,Cr,Ni,Mn&
Pb),dyesremoval and other effluent parameters (colour,
pH, EC, N,P,Cl, COD, BOD, TDS, TSS ).Significant
reductions in all these parameters were found with B MP1
consortium. Thestudy also revealed that effluentstreated
by consortium BMP1 wasnot toxic to maize (Zea mays
L. CV C1415 ).Hence, present work demonstrates that
consortium BMP1 ( Bacillus s ubtilus, Bacillus cereus,
