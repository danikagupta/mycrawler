MEAL AS A PROTEIN SUPPLEMENT TO 
COTTONSEED MEAL-CORN DIETS FOR PIGS 
by 
Robert R. Kifer and Edgar P. Young 
ABSTRACT 
Pig diets composed primarily of cottonseed meal and corn are deficient in the amino 
acid lysine. This study reports on whether supplement ation by menhaden meal can supply 
the lysine needed. A significant improvement in rate of weight gain and in utilization of 
feed resulted when menhaden meal was fed as a feed supplement. No fishy flavor was de­
tected in loins of pigs fed diets containing as much as 0.73 percent fish oil supplied by 
the menhaden meal.

menhaden meal were considered adequate to

Comm rcially produc d 'dego ypolized' cot­
ton eed meal ( olvent extracted) wa elected 
from a group of about 25 ample. The elec­
tion of this m al \\'a made on the ba i of 
analy e for high crude-protein content (41.5 
percent), low free go ypol content (0.03 per­
cent) (Method of American Oil hemi ts' So­
ciety, 1960), low total go sypol content (0.94 percent) (King,Frampton, and Altschul, 1958), 
and high content of lysine with free epsilon 
amino group (3.5 grams per 16 grams of meal 
nitrogen) (Conkerton and Frampton, 1959). 
Corn (U.S. #2 yellow) was obtained from com­
mercial sources. 
b. Pig-feeding trial. -Forty crossbred 
Yorkshire X Hampshire pigs of known breed­
ing, 16.4 kilograms average weight, were pur­
chased at a local feeder-pig sale. In addition, 
16 pigs of similar breeding, weight, and age 
were obtained from the University of Maryland 
herd to give a combined total of 56 pigs. The 
pigs were divided into two groups and fed a 
24-percent crude-protein pig-starting diet for 
2 days and then an 18-percent-protein diet until 
selected for allotment to the experiment. From 
the total of 56 pigs, 36 were selected on the 
basis of thriftness--that is, general appearance 
and weight per day of age--and allotted to 
the experiment. 
Four pigs, 2 males and 2 females, each 
weighing from 18.2 to 27.3 kilograms, were 
randomly allotted to each of nine treatments 
(Table 1) and fed the various experimental 
diets (Table 2) until they each attained about 
90.9 kilogram s live weight. We considered four 
pigs per treatment adequate for proper statis­
tical evaluation. As is shown in Table 2, the 
diets fed were formulated to contain the desired 
levels of crude protein and Were fortified 
(Table 2, footnotes 1-4) as needed to supply 
all the nutrients known to be required by grow-ing pigs. Levels of total protein were lowered 
2 percent when the pigs each attained a live 
weight of about 56.8 kilograms. 
The dietary variables studied were level 
of protein (16, 15, and 14 percent) from all 
sources--namely, menhaden meal, cotton eed 
meal, and corn. All the pigs in each lot were 
fed individually. Feed was offered to the pigs 
three times daily for a 4-week period and then 
two times daily for the remainder of the ex­
periment. The pigs were held in individual 
crate-type pens while being fed. At each feed­
ing, the pigs were permitted to consume feed 
according to appetite for a maximum time of 
1 hour. Between feedings, the 4 pigs per test 
pen were turned out of the crates and per­
mitted to move freely about the remainder of 
the pen to an automatic waterer. 
2. Results 
Table 3 gives the results of the pig-feeding 
trial. 
a. With 16% total protein in the diet.­
The pigs fed the cottonseed meal-corn diet 
containing 16-percent total dietary protein 
vvith 4 percent of the protein supplied by men­
haden meal (CC12-MM4; CC10-MlVI4) gained 
weight at a significantly greater rate an'1 uti­
lized the feed more efficiently than did the pigs 
fed the diet without menhaden meal (CC16-

Note: Diet CCI6-MMO; CCI4-MMO means (I) that during Period I, 
the diet contained 16 percent of protein and that all of this protein was 
supplied by cottonseed meal and corn and none was supplied by men­
haden meal and (2) that during Period 2, the diet contained 14 percent 
of protein and that all of this protein was supplied by cottonseed meal 
and corn and none was supplied by menhaden meal The other diet 
symbols have corresponding meaning. 
16-percent diet containing only 2 percent of 
the protein from menhaden meal (CC14-MM2; 
CC12-MM2) exhibited a similar rate of gain 
and utilization of feed. 
b. With 15% total protein in the diet.­
The inclusion of either 2 or 4 percent protein 
from menhaden meal in a 15-percent protein 
diet (CC13-MM2; CCll-MM2 or CCll-MM4; 
CC9-MM4) supported significantly greater 
rates of gain than did the 15-percent protein 
diet without menhaden meal (CC15-MMO; 
CC13-MMO). Similarly, more efficient util­
ization of feed was obtained from both diets 
(CC13-MM2; CCll-MM2 and CCll-MM4; 
CC9-MM4) compared with diet CC15-MMO; 
CC13-MMO. c. With 14% total protein in the diet.­
Similarly , the inclusion of the two menhaden 
meal protein levels (CC12-MM2; CC10-MM2 
and CC10-MM4; CC8-MM4) in a 14-percent 
protein diet resulted in significantly improved 
rates of gain and utilization of feed as com­
pared with a 14-percent protein diet lacking 
the menhaden meal (CC14-MMO; CC12-MMO). 
3. Discussion 
Supplementing the cottonseed meal-corn 
diets with menhaden meal did, in general, im­
prove rates of gain and utilization of feed. 
This improvement probably is in response to 
the high lysine content in the menhaden meal. 
However, at the 16-percent dietary level, the 
inclusion of 2 percent protein from menhaden 
meal did not elicit an improvement in rate 
of gain or utilization of feed. One possible 
explanation for the lack of response from the 
2-percent protein supplemental level would in­
volve the marginal supplementar y level of one 
of the amino acids not normally deficient in 
menhaden meal. For instance, Becker, Las­
siter, Terrill, and Norton (1954) indicated that 
menhaden meal tends to be too deficient in tryp­
tophan to supplement corn adequately. There­
fore, increasing the dietary content of men­
haden meal would overcome the deficiency 
quantitatively. The consumption of feed can 
probably be excluded as a factor affecting rates 
of gain, because the results of the mUltiple re­
gression-covariance analysis indicate that the 
feed was consumed in adequate amounts (Table 
4) .

137 The possibility of gossypol-toxicity inter­
ference also cannot be overlooked, although in­
ternal toxicity symptoms were not detected 
when the viscera were inspected routinely at 
the packing plant. In this tudy the highest 
gossypol content of the diets fed was 0.0075 
percent, which is below the 0.01 percent free 
gossypol dietary level reported to cause tox­
icity symptoms (Hale and Lyman, 1957). 
However, the calculated total amoun of gos­
sypol--namely, 20 grams--consumed by the pigs 
in our study was only slightly lower than the 
24.9-gram total gossypol consumption reported 
by Hale and Lyman (1957) to cause death. 
Perhaps the lowe1' gain in weight and poorer 
'1tilization of feed obtained \\'ith the pigs fed 
the corn-cottonseed control diets is clue to a 
pathological gossypol toxicity that is not ap­
parent. Baliga and Lyman (1957) hm'e pos­
tulated that go sypol \\'ill react \\'ith an amino 
group of the protein to form an insoluble in­
digestible complex. The quantity and quality 
of the protein in th diet weI' also hO\\'n to 
reduce gossypol-toxicity interference. So, the 
menhaden meal, in addition to Cl'eating the 
pc)stulated better amino acid balance, could have 
functioned as postulate d to block the deleterious 
effects of gos ypol (Hale and Lyman, 1962). 
T\\'o pigs became sick during the study, one 
each in a group that was fed a cottonseed meal­
com diet containing either 15 or 14 percent protein. The e pigs became feverish and 
stopped ating for 2 to days. They then 
gradually returned to the average feed intake 
of their re pective roup.

ables may have elicited differences in carcass 
composition, but, if so, the differences were 
masked by the variability of the data.

139 II. EFFECT OF MENHADEN-MEAL SUPPLEMENTATION ON THE FLAVOR 
OF THE COOKED FLESH 
A. PROCEDURE 
After each of the pigs was slaughtered , 
the right loin was collected and frozen. Twelve 
portions, 1.3 centimeter s thick, were then cut 
from the frozen loin, proceeding posteriorly 
from the 10th rib. These portions were used 
in a triangular organoleptic test to determine 
primarily if any "fish" taste was imparted 
to the meat of the pigs fed the diets containing 
the menhade n meal. Four replications of the 
test were made using the three experimental 
treatment variables of 0, 2, or 4 percent pro­
tein from menhaden meal in each replication. 
When 8 of the 12 panel members could pair 
the like samples, the difference due to the ex­
perimental variable was considered to be sig­
nificant (P<.05). 
One-half cup of water was added to each 
sample in an uncovered pan, and the samples 
were baked for 50 minutes in a gas oven at 
3250 F. No seasoning was added to the 
samples. 
Upon removal of the samples from the oven, 
the lean meat and the fat were cut from the 
bone and minced together in a Hobart' meat 
slicer to a finely divided mixture. The indi­
vidual samples were heated in a double boiler 
to 700 C., divided into about 12 equal parts, 
and served immediately. One test was held

(chi square test). 
B. RESULTS 
The menhaden meal used in this trial con­
tained 11.71 percent oil by analysis (Dambergs, 
1956), which, when the meal was incorporated 
into the diet at a level of 6.24 parts per hun­
dred, this amount of oil resulted in a dietary 
level of 0.73 percent fish oil. 
A statistical analysis of the results of three 
organoleptic tests replicated four times indi­
cated that the various treatments did not pro­
duce significantly different flavors. Significant 
difference s were noted for each of two repli­
cates of each dietary comparison (Table 6). 
This may be attributable to the fact that sev­
eral panel members in these comparisons de­
tected an "off-flavor," which they described as 
being mu ty or slightly rancid. These off­
flavors were detected with all three dietary 
variables of 0, 2, and 4 percent protein from 
menhaden meals; increased detection paral­
leled the increase in level of menhaden meal. 
Apparently, however, the off-flavors did not 
lower the acceptability of the meat. 
Inasmuch as the meat of the control ani­
mals had off-flavors, the fish oil contained in 
the menhaden meal apparently did not cause 
the off -flavored meat. One possible explana­
tion for the off-flavors is that the meat samples

1 ces of oxidative reactions in some samples 
packed with exposure to air. Dassow and 
Miyauchi (1965) have reported on such re­
actions. 
The adverse effects of the presence of oxy­
gen on the composit ion of the surviving micro­
flora in radiopasteur ized seafoods have also 
been of concern to researchers (Licciarde llo, 
Ronsivalli, and Slavin, 1966; Sinskey, Pablo, 
Silverma n, and Ronsivalli, 1967; and Silver­
man and Sin key, 1968). 
Because of the ubiquity of spores of Clos­
tridillln botulinum and because of the suita­
bility of most seafoods as a substrate for these 
organisms, whatever advantages are to be 
gained by excluding air from the package may 
be negated by the increa~e d risk of botulism 
(should the product be mishandle d and its temperat ure allowed to rise during storage). 
But the risk of botulism may not be restricted 
to anaerobically packed seafoods. Localized 
anaerobic sites can conceivably develop in con­
tainers even though air is not removed from 
the headspace before the container is sealed, 
especially when the package is not permeable 
to gases. Although the oxidation -reduction po­
tential, not the oxygen tension, governs the 
growth of strict anaerobes, oxygen is never­
theless a factor in the establishment of the 
level of the oxidation-reduction potential. 
Because of our growing interest in the role 
of oxygen in stored, radiopasteurized seafoods, 
the purpose of the study reported here was to 
determine the changes in the percentag e of 
oxygen in the headspace of hermetically sealed 
cans containing radiopasteurized fillets stored 
at about 0.50 C. 
I. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Described here are the methods used in 
the prepal'ation of the samples contained in 
the hermetica lly sealed cans and the methods 
llsed in the measurement of the concentratio n 
of oxygen in the headspaces of these cans. 
A. PREPARATION OF SAMPLES 
This section reports on the source of the 
fillets used as samples and the method of 
handling these fillets and the cans in which 
they were packed. 
'1. Source of Fillets Used as Samples 
Because haddock (MelanogI'a1n1nUS aegle­
Iii, II.~) have been investigated extensive ly in 
thi" laboratory, they were used as the source 
of the fillets studied in this work. 
2. Method of Handling Fillet 
Sampl s and Cans 
This subsection describes the method of 
packing the fillets in cans, the modifications of 
the cans to permit the headspaces to be sampled, 
and the method of irradiating and storing the 
cans. 
144 a. Method of packing the samples in cans. 
-Commerc ially cut fillets of haddock were 
packed in modified No. 2% C-enameled cans in 
such a manner that the heads pace of each can 
was about 75 milliliter s. 
b. Modification of cans to permit sampling 
of headspace. -Before we sealed a can, we 
modified its lid by punching out a small hole 
in the center and by sealing an injection-port 
septum over the hole. The purpose of this hole 
was to permit us to 'ample the headspace gas 
of the can, by means of a syringe, without de­
stroying the hermetic seal. 
c. Irradiation and storage of the cans.­
The cans were irradiated at a level of 250 kil­
orads and stored for up to 30 days at about 
0.50 C. Connors and Steinberg (1964) have 
described the details of irradiation and storage. 
B. MEASUREMENT OF THE 
CONCENTRATION OF OXYGEN 
IN THE HEADSPACE 
To check on our measurements of the change 
in the percentage of oxygen in fhe headspace of each can during storage, we used two in­
dependent methods for determining the per­
centage: namely, the polarographic method 
and the gas chromato graphic method. 
The polarographic method, with an accu­
racy of -+-1 percent, was the simpler of the 
two to use. Furthermore, its use required no 
calculations. On the other hand, the gas 
chromatographic method, with an accuracy 
better than -+-1 percent (see Figure 3, Peaks 
A and B), made possible nondestructive mul­
tiple analyses, which could not be made with 
the equipment that we used in the polaro­
graphic method. In addition, the gas chromat­
ograph was better suited for analyzing for 
carbon dioxide simultaneously, if we had de­
cided to do so. 1. Polarographic Method 
The equipment used was a Beckman Model 
777 Oxygen Analyzer ' featuring a patented 
polarographic oxygen sensor, which measures 
the partial pressure of oxygen directly. The 
sensor was connected to a Beckman headspace 
sampler, which in turn was attached to the 
can as is indicated in Figure 1. Details of the 
equipment and of the method of use are avail­
able from the manufacturer. 
2. Gas Chromatographic Method

equipment used, (b) the method of sampling

scribing the detector responses, (d) the con­
ditions and procedure used, and (e) the method 
of calculating the data. 
a. Equipment used. -An Aerograp h A-
90P gas chromatograph with a thermal-con­
ductivity detector and two stainless-steel col­
umns, 0.25 inch (6.35 millimeters) in diameter, 
placed in series, was used. The first column, 
which was packed with silica gel, isolated car­
bon dioxide from oxygen, nitrogen, and other 
gases. The second column, which was packed 
with molecular sieve, absorbed carbon dioxide 
and separated the oxygen hom nitrogen and 
other components. 
b. Method of sampling headspace gases. 
-The headgases were sampled with a 1-mil­
liliter gastight syringe through the sampling port of a Zahm tester (Figure 2), which is 
similar to the Beckman headspace sampler and 
which was used to facilitate the transfer of the 
sample. 
c. Method of transcribing detector respon­
ses.-The detector respon es were transcribed 
on a Leeds Northrop strip-chart recorder. 
d. Conditions and procedure used. -De­
tails of the gas chromatograph conditions and 
the procedure were the same as those described 
by Karel, Is enberg, Ronsivalli, and Jurin 
(1963). 
e. Method of calculating data. -The val­

percent argon in air. 
The presence of argon had to be taken in to 
account, because, under the conditions of the 
test, its retention time was the same as that 
of oxygen. 
In our calculations, we used the peak height 
in the chromatogra m as a quantitative mea­
sure of the volume of oxygen represented by 
the peak, even though the standard procedure 
is to use the peak area as a measure of the 
volume. Our justification for using the peak 
height is the correlation that we established 
earlier for the volume of oxygen, the peak area, 
and the peak height. This relation was true 
provided the operating condition (for ex­
ample, temperature of the column and rate of 
flow of the carrier gas) were not changed so 
as to alter the width of the peak.

149 TEST-TANK STUDIES OF SHRIMP-POT 
EFFICIENCY 
by 
Doyne W. Kessler 
ABSTRACT 
How spot shrimp and dock shrimp escape from shrimp pots and how they react to 
each of five designs of shrimp-pot entrances were studied. Observations of pot efficien­
cy--that is, of the number of shrimp entering and escaping each type of pot in a given 
time--indicate that a long conical tunnel was the most effective of the entrance s tested.

151 INTRODUCTION 
Fishermen in Southeastern Alaska have 
used shrimp pots for many years; however, 
little information is available on the factors 
that affect the efficiency of shrimp pots. Each 
fisherman has his own idea of the most effective 
design. As a result, opinions conflict on which 
design is best. 
Butler (1963) and Dahlstrom (1963) I were 
among the first to study factors that affect 
the efficiency of shrimp pots. Butler demon­
strated that traps made with a solid covering, 
such as metal, may be more effective than web­
covered traps. Dahlstrom reported that size 
and shape may also influence their effectiveness. 
During Cruise 65-3 of the research vessel 
John R. Manning, the staff of the Bureau of 
Commercial Fisheries Exploratory Fishing 
and Gear Research Base in Juneau, Alaska, 
made additional studies of shrimp pots. This 
preliminary work indicated that the design of 
the entrance to the shrimp pot may also be 
an important factor affecting the efficiency of 
the pots. 
In the past, the efficiency of shrimp pots 
was evaluated by catch analyses rather than 
by observations. Use of catch analyses is 
unquestiona bly indispensable for the final eval­
uation of fishing equipment. An observational approach, however, does answer some of the 
questions of design that arise during develop­
mental stages of gear research. 
These studies of shrimp pots seem particu­
larly adaptable to an observation technique. 
Observations on how known numbers of shrimp 
react to various types of pots can be made 
under controlled conditions in a large test tank. 
Pots can be modified and tested without the 
need to make and fish the large numbers of 
pots that would be required for testing in the 
field. The final design can then be field tested. 
Thus, much of the time that would be lost in 
field testing intermedi ate modifications can be 
eliminated. 
The studies on shrimp-pot efficiency pre­
sented in this paper represent the first use of 
the observat ional technique by the staff of the 
Base at Juneau, Alaska. During February, 
March, and April 1966, shrimp pots were stu­
died under controlled conditions in a large test 
tank at Little Port Walter, Alaska. Primary 
goals were (1) to determine how shrimp escape 
from the pots and (II) to measure the relative 
efficiency of the pots in terms of the number 
of shrimp entering and escaping pots that had 
different types of entrance s. 
I. DETERMINING ESCAPE BEHAVIOR OF SHRIMP 
A. PROCEDURE 
Described in this section are (1) the shrimp, 
(2) the test tank, (3) the lighting, (4) the 
shrimp pot, and (5) the observational tech­
nique. 
1. Shrimp 
The shrimp were caught by small shrimp 
pots set on the bottom in Little Port Walter 
1 Dahlstrom. Walt. 1963. Cruise report 63-A-1 prawn-Shrimp . Cal­
ifornia Department of Fish and Game, Fisheries laboratory, Terminal 
Island, California, 3 pages, 2 figures. Unpublished manuscript. 
152 Bay in 10 fathoms or less. The shrimp were 
too small to be of commercial importance, av­
eraging 80 whole shrimp per pound. Com­
mercial sized shrimp averaging 14 or less whole 
shrimp per pound were not available during 
these experiments. 
2. Test Tank 
The experiments were made in a 4-by 4-
by 8-foot plywood test tank lined with fiber­
glass and having a 2-foot square window on one 
side. This tank was filled to a depth of 34 inches with water that was pumped from the 
bottom of the bay through plastic pipes. A 
standpipe at one end of the tank controlled 
the level of the water. 
3. Lighting 
Lighting in the test tank was held to a 
minimum during all tests. A black "Vis­
queen'" tent over the test tank produced nearly 
total darkness between observations. Illumina­
tion during observations was by two 40-watt 
incandescent lights, one above each end of the 
test tank. 
4. Shrimp Pot 
A circular, collapsible shrimp pot baited 
with herring, which had been thawed, was used. 
The Base previously had used this type of pot, 
covered with 11,4-inch stretch mesh, in explor­
atory fishing in Alaska. 
5. Observational Technique 
Ten spot shrimp, Pandalus platyceros, av­
eraging 0.7 inch in carapace length were put 
in the test tank about 1 hour before the baited 
collapsible pot was added. Shrimp were ob­
served continuously for the first hour and then 
intermittently at 1f2-hour or 1-hour intervals 
throughout the 8-hour test. Lights were on 
continually for the first half of the test but 
were turned off between observations during 
the second half. B. RESULTS 
The observations indicated that the l1,4-inch 
stretch mesh of the collapsible pot was too large 
to retain the spot shrimp tested. Shrimp en­
tered and left the pot at will through the web 
instead of through the tunnel entrances. 
Shrimp backed tail first through the web, using 
their walking legs to force themselves slowly 
through and stretching the mesh to allow the 
carapace to pass through the web. The escape 
behavior resembled the settling phase of the 
burrowing movement s of pink shrimp, Penaeus 
duorarum, as described by Fuss (1964). The 
entire process took several minutes. 
The activity of the shrimp was inversely 
related to the amount of illumination. During 
a 4-hour period of constant illumination , the 
shrimp remained motionle ss on the web of the 
pot, under the pot, or in the shadow of the 
standpipe. After 1 hour of darkness, the 
shrimp were actively swimmin g or crawling 
about the test tank. The general decrease in 
the activity of the shrimp during periods of 
illumination agrees with the observat ions by 
Fuss and Ogren (1966), who reported a de­
crease in activity of pink shrimp with in­
creasing levels of light. 
The shrimp had little interest in the bait. 
Once inside the pot, they tended to remain 
motionless on the pot webbing. No shrimp 
was seen on or near the bait during this phase 
of the experiment. 
II. DETERMINING EFFICIENCY OF SHRIMP·POTS WITH 
VARIOUS ENTRANCES 
The relative efficiency of five designs of 
pot entrances was tested in two experiments 
concerning (A) ease of shrimp entry and (B) 
ease of shrimp exit. 
• Trade names referred to in this publication do not imply endorse· 
ment of commercial products. A. POT EFFICIENCY, MEASURED 
BY EASE OF SHRIMP ENTRY 
The experiment on ease of entry was de­
signed to determine the number of shrimp 
that would enter pots through each of five 
different types of openings in 4 hours. 
153 Figure l.--Shrimp pots with five types of entrances used In efficiency tests: A. ~hort tunnel; B. Long tunnel; 
C. Top loader; D. Ramp; E. Plastic pipe. 
Experimental Procedure 
Each of the five shrimp pot entrances was 
tested four times. The order of these tests 
was randomized so that each entrance type was 
tested on two different mornings and two dif­
ferent afternoons. The five types of shrimp­
pot entrances are shovm in Figure 1. 
Tunnels of four different designs were in­
corporated in the ends of 12-by 12-by 24-
inch wooden lath pots with 1-by 2-inch wooden 
frames. The e tunnels were made of %-inch 
nylon bobbinet. The fifth entrance was made 
from a I-pound tin can set in the top of a 10%­
by 18-by 24-inch wooden lath pot. Figure 2 
hows the d tails of construction for the var­
ious tunnels. 
154 The shrimp were taken in small shrimp pots 
set on bottom in Little Port Walter Bay in 10 
fathoms or less. These shrimp were from 0.5 
to 1.1 inches in carapace length and averaged 
0.7 inch, or about 80 shrimp per pound. Spot 
shrimp were used whenever possible; how­
ever, when catches of spot shrimp were insuf­
ficient to supply the need, dock shrimp, Pan­
dalus danae, were used. 
To minimize difference s in the physical 
condition of the animal that might affect the 
results, we used uniform procedures in hand­
ling all shrimp. Until needed for a test, shrimp 
were held for several days without food in live 
cages on the bottom of the bay. Although con­
siderable effort was made to keep uniform the 
length of time that the shrimp were held be-fore a test, this uniformity could not always 
be achieved, owing to the variability of daily 
catches. The 20 shrimp used in each test were

155 necessary to minimize prolonged exposure of 
the shrimp to the fresh surface water from 
Sashin Creek, which usually killed them. 
For each test, 20 shrimp were placed in the 
test tank and allowed to become accustomed 
to their new environment for one-half hour. 
When a pot baited with thawed herring was 
put into the tank, the observations began. How 
the shrimp reacted to the entrance of the 
shrimp pot was observed during the first half­
hour of the test. The circulati on of water then 
was stopped for the rest of the test. The lights 
were turned off except for the short time 
needed to count the number of shrimp inside 
and outside the pot after 1;2, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. 
r he test ended after the fifth count. 
Results of the experiment were analyzed 
statistically by analysis of variance and Dun­
can's new mUltiple-range test (Steel and Torrie, 
1960). Because the variances were not ho­
mogeneo us, it was necessary to perform a log 
transformation on the raw data before per­
forming these tests.

backward on the web, toward the plastic ring 
forming the inner tunnel opening. Most of 
the shrimp remained for awhile part way 
through the ring before continuin g, either head 
or tail first, into the center of the pot. An 
average of 5.25 shrimp per pot, or 26.2 per­
cent of the shrimp, were inside the pot at the 
end of 4 hours. 
b. Plastic-pipe pot. -Fifteen shrimp en­
tered the funnel shaped web lead-in modified 
with a 2-inch piece of plastic pipe; none 
escaped during the four tests. The shrimp 
entered this type of pot in the same manner 
as they did in the long-tunn el pots. An average 
of 3.75 shrimp per pot, or 18.8 percent of the 
shrimp, were captured by the pot of this type. 
c. Short-tunnel pot. -Thirteen shrimp en­
tered and two escaped through the short fiat, 
web entrance with a shallow lead-in. Although 
none were actually seen entering the pot, one 
shrimp was seen on the plastic ring forming 
the inner entrance opening. One tried to enter 
the pot by repe~tedly charging head first a­
gainst the lower web of the entrance. An 
average of 2.75 shrimp per pot, or 13.8 per­
cent of the shrimp, were captured by the pot 
of this type. d. Top-loader pot.-Seven shrimp entered 
and two escaped through the tin-can opening 
of the top-loader entrance . N one of these 
shrimp were observed entering or leaving the 
pot. Although shrimp were seen crawling and 
swimming around the sides of the pot, none 
were observed on or near the top of the pot, 
where the entrance was located. An average 
of 1.25 shrimp per pot, or 6.2 percent of the 
shrimp, were captured by the pot of this type . 
e. Ramp pot. -Fewer shrimp entered 
through the fiat, sloping ramp than entered the 
other entrances. Of the six shrimp that en­
tered, five left, leaving only one shrimp cap­
tured during four tests. Shrimp entered this 
type of tunnel by crawling slowly up the ramp 
head first. Once at the top, they either dropped 
into the center of the pot or continued crawling 
slowly down the underside of the ramp. An 
average of 0.25 shrimp per pot, or 1.2 percent 
of the shrimp, were captured by the pot of this 
type. 
B. POT EFFICIENCY, MEASURED 
BY EASE OF SHRIMP EXIT 
The experiment on ease of exit was to de­
termine the number of shrimp that would 
escape pots through the entrance openings used 
in the ease-of-entry experiment. 
1. Experimental Procedure 
For each of the tests in this experiment, 
20 shrimp were placed inside the pot at the 
start of the test, and bait (thawed herring) 
was placed outside the pot. All other proce­
dures were the same as those used in the ease 
of entry experiment. 
2. Results 
Shrimp were seen trying to escape the pots 
by means other than through the entrance tun­
nels. They tried to escape through the small 
cracks between the wooden slats and through 
small openings between the web and the side of 
the pot. Sometimes they attempted to escape 
by wedging the carapace through head first, 
157 but they u ually in erted the tail through the 
crack fir t. The walking leg were then used 
to force the carapace through the narrow op­
ening. sually, thi procedure was slow. The 
movement of the tail and walking legs re-
embled a burrowing type of behavior. Oc­
casionally, the hrimp became violent, flipping 
their tail rapidly a!1d straining their walking 
legs in an effort to force themselves through. 
'In one test, several shrimp were seen escaping 
in this manner; therefore, the test was re­
peated after the pot had been repaired . 
Escape of hrimp through the tunnel en­
trance openings of pots in good repair are 
summarized in Table 2 and Figures 5 and 6. 
a. Long-tunnel pot. -Fewer shrimp es­
caped from the long funnel-shaped web tunnel 
than from the other entrances. Only two 
:-hrimp left this type of pot, but one of them 
went back in, which left only one shrimp out­
~ide lhe pot after four tests. This entrance 
limited escape to an average of 0.25 shrimp 
Pt'l ]lot. 01' 1.2 percent of the shrimp that were 
n:-;ide the pot at the start of the tests.

instance. The entrance limited the escape of 
shrimp to an average of 2.0 shrimp per pot, 
or 10.0 percent of the shrimp that were inside 
the pot at the start of the tests.

CONCLUSIONS 
Analyses of difference in th £1\' rag num­
ber of shrimp entering or caping from ach 
type of pots were stati ticatty ignificant at 
the 95 percent level of confid nce. 
The long-tunnel d) ot was the most m ient 
pot. Significantly fewer hrimp e cap d from 
this pot than from all oth r pols test d. Is, 
significantly more 11l'imp w nt int thi lyp

type. Significantly more hrimp cap d f1' m

significantly fewer shrimp enter d lhis pot than

DISCUSSION 
The ability of shrimp to escape through 
cracks and loose web indicates the importance 
of constructing the pot carefully and of main­
taininO' it properly . As we have ju t seen, 
hrimp will e cape from pots by forcing them­
elves, tailfir t, through mall crack and 
through hole in the web.

any hrimp wimmin

shrimp walk upside down along the under ide 
of a ramp revealed that shrimp could crawl 
out of this entrance. Because shrimp tended 
to approach the pots from the side, circling 
around them rather than swimming over them, 
only a few shrimp would find their way into 
an entrance that is located on the top of a 
pot with vertical sides. Becau e shrimp usu­
ally approached the pots by crawling along th 
bottom of the tank, they may be div rt d from 
their path by a vertical wall of web--especially 
if they are being led directly toward th bait, which wa on the bottom of the pot. The 
g ntle loping web of the long tunn I entrance 
may tend to "lead" them toward the bait. 
uantitative data obtained fr m the e ex­
p riments indicate diff r nce in hrimp-pot 
entrance fficiencie. The c nclusi n , how­

Hymenopenaeus robustus, ON THREE POTENTIAL 
COMMERCIAL GROUNDS OFF 
THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES 
by 
Richard 8. Roe 
ABSTRACT 
The royal-red shrimp is an underused species. This paper reports on their distri­
bution on grounds east of St. Augustine, Florida; south-southwe st of the Dry Tortugas, 
Florida; and southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. On these grounds, the shrimp live 
only on soft bottom types and in water temperatures of 80 to 120 C.; the densities of 
shrimp vary seasonally on all three grounds; the depth distribution of shrimp also varies 
seasonally--the shrimp move offshore in summer and inshore in winter.

162 INTRODUCTION 
Although the royal-red shrimp is a typical 
penaeid with well-developed eyes, large pleo­
pods, and exceptionally long antennae (Figure 
1), it differs from commercial penaeids of the 
genus Penaeus because it prefers deep, cold 
water. The species occurs on the upper Con­
tinental Slope from as far north as Cape Hat­
teras, North Carolina, to as far south as the 
coast of the Guianas, but it is abundant in only 
a few areas. Little is known of its biology, 
particularly its reproduction and early life 
history. 
Since the discovery in 1950 of concentra­
tions of royal-red shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico, 
the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries Explor­
atory Fishing and Gear Research Base at Pas­
cagoula, Mississippi, has made periodic trawl­
ing surveys along the Continental Slope from 
North Carolina to Brazil to evaluate the com­
mercial potential of this resource (Springer 
and Bullis, 1952, 1954; Bullis, 1956; Bullis and 
, .... -~-----
.. ~ ... Rathjen, 1959; Bullis and Thompson, 1959; 
Bullis and Cummins, 1963; Cummin s and Riv­
ers, 1962). Results of these surveys indicate 
that three grounds off the coast of the United 
States support commercial quantities of royal­
red shrimp. These grounds are located east 
of St. Augustine, Florida, in the western At­
lantic; south-southwest of the Dry Tortugas 
in the Florida Straits; and southeast of the 
Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico 
(Figure 2). 
The purpose of this paper, which sum­
marizes the data obtained on the exploratory 
fishing surveys, is to relate certain of the phys­
ical characteristics of the individual grounds 
to their populations of shrimp. 
The paper is divided into two main parts. 
The first reports specific observations on the 
three potential commerci al grounds; the sec­
ond, general observations.

163 I. SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS ON THE THREE POTENTIAL 
COMMERCIAL GROUNDS 
One of the grounds is in the Atlantic Ocean 
off St. Augustine, Florida; the others are in 
the Gulf of Mexico. 
A. GROUNDS IN THE 
ATLANTI C OCEAN OFF 
ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA 
In this section, I first describe the physical 
appearance of the grounds and then report on 
catch observations .. 
1. Physical Description of Grounds 
The St. Augustine ground lie between lat­
itudes 27°31' and 31 °00' North in 185 to 550 
meters along the Continental Slope (Figure 2). 
The average width of the grounds is 8.3 nauti­
cal miles; the angle of the slope is relatively 
steep (Figure 3).

Figure 3.-Slope profiles of the study grounds. 
164 Shrimp trawling is limited to one range of 
depth for various reasons. The bottom be­
tween 185 and 255 meters cannot be trawled 
because of formations of limestone and dense 
stands of deep-ea alyconarians (sea fan). 
From 255 to about 475 meters, the bottom con­
sists of sand or silty-and sediments (Emery, 
1965) commonly called "green mud" by fish­
ermen. The bottom at this range in depth 
has few obstruction s and provides excellent 
trawling. Beyond 475 meters, the bottom sup­
ports large patches of deep-sea coral (Lophelia 
p1'olijera) and therefore is not trawlable with 
standard shrimp gear (Bullis and Rathjen, 
1959) . 
Figur 4 shows the average annual temper­
ature profile for the ground. The 12° C. iso­
therm lies at about 220 meter; the 11 ° C. 
isotherm, at 238 meters; and the 10° C. iso­
therm, at 256 meters. The 9° and 8° C. iso­
therms are broad. The 9° C. isotherm covers 
depths of 275 to 400 meters, and the 8 ° C. 
i otherm covers depths of 400 to 475 meters. 
.2. Catch Observations 
Inshore penaeid shrimps (Penaeus aztecus, 
P. setijentS, and P. duoraTum) vary diurnally 
in availability (Idyll, 1950; Iversen and Idyll, 
1959; Fuss and Ogren, 1966; Joyce and Eldred, 
1966). This variability dictates the hours of 
fishing for those species. Because diurnal cycles 
of availability have not been investigated in 
royal-red shrimp, day and night catch data 
were compared for evidence of differences in 
the availability of the shrimp. 
In addition to these observations on the 
differences, if any, between the day and night 
catches, data were gathered on the distribution 
of the shrimp. 
a. Comparison of day and night catches. 
(1) Methods.-The catch data used in 
the study were collected from 1950 to 1965 and 
were obtained with standard Gulf of Mexico 
flat shrimp trawls having headropes 12.2 to 30.5 15.~,,--- ----- ----- --- ------ --,

200 300 350 400 450 500 550 Figure 4.-Bottom temperature profile of 
the royal-red shrimp grounds 
off St. Augustine, the Dry Tor­
tugas, and the Mississippi River 
Delta. DEPTH (melers) 
meters long, having 5.1-centimeter stretched­
mesh webbing, and having 1.5-to 3.0-meter 
wooden doors. These trawls were fished 1 
to 4 hours. The shrimp caught were sorted 
and weighed aboard ship. The weights taken 
were of whole shrimp. 
Because of the variety of trawl sizes and 
fishing times used in the study, we--the staff 
at the Exploratory Fishing and Gear Research 
Base at Pascagoula--standardized catch data 
by converting pounds of shrimp caught per 
hour to estimates of relative shrimp density 
expressed in kilograms of shrimp per hectare. 
The calculations used in the study may con­
tain errors that are now impossible to eliminate . 
The sources of these possible errors are the 
selectivity and limitations of the gear and the 
distribution of individual animals over the bot­
tom. The shrimp trawl used in this explora­
tory fishing is selective, owing to a stretched­
mesh size of 5.1 centimeters, which allows small 
individuals to escape through the trawl body 
and throat. It has further limitations in that 
(a) burrowed shrimp may be passed over and 
(b) shrimp near the periphery of the trawl 
path can avoid capture by moving laterally. 
Hence a portion of the shrimp population is 
unavailable to the gear. In addition, the meth­
od of standardizing the catch data is based on 
the assumption that individual shrimp are 
randomly distributed; however, the distribu­
tion may actually be nonrandom. 
Owing to these limitations, the densities re­
ported in this paper are intended to be used as estimates of relative densities of shrimp 
rather than as actual densities . 
The method, programmed for the UNIVAC 
1004 III, uses towing speed, duration of drag, 
and gear size to compute hectares by the fol­
lowing formula: 
Hectares 100 K x M x 0.6L 
107640 
where, K = speed in knots; M = minutes 
fished; L = head rope length in feet; and 
107640 = a constant. 
The final step is to convert catch into kil­
ograms per hectare to provide an estimate of 
relative density relating to the available portion 
of the population. 
The height of the opening of the net was 
not used for two reasons: (1) we assumed 
that royal-red shrimp has the same swimming 
and jumping abilities as inshore penaeids and 
hence would not be able to escape the effective 
vertical net opening of 1.2 to 1.8 meters at­
tained in normal trawling and (2) the intro­
duction of a third dimension, namely height, 
would create numerous problems in calculating 
shrimp density, which is primarily a two-di­
mensional distribution. 
For the comparison of day and night 
catches, data were selected from common time 
periods and depth intervals in one or more 
seasons for each of the grounds. The time 
period for day was selected as being 6 a.m. to 
165 6 p.m. and that for night as being 6 p.m. to 
6 a.m. 
(2) Results.-The St. Augustine catch 
data had no distinguishable differences between 
day and night, because the variations about 
the means were large. 
The same observations were made on the 
catches from the other two grounds. The data 
for the St. Augustine grounds, the Dry Tor­
tugas grounds, and the Mississippi Delta 
grounds all failed to show any decided dif­
ference between day and night catches. 
b. Shrimp distribution.-This study of shrimp 
distribution is concerned with the relation of 
shrimp density to depth distribution and the 
relation of shrimp density to bottom temper­
ature. 
(1) Relation of shrimp density to depth 
distributio n.-The principal aims in calculating 
shrimp densities on each of the three grounds 
were to determine the depth distribution of 
royal-red shrimp and to learn whether or not 
seasonal variation occurs in this distribution. 
(a) A ve-rage depth dist-ribution. 
[1] Method.-The depth disb"i­
bution was determined by computing shrimp 
densities for each of the grounds from the 
total trawling data grouped by 18.3-meter in­
tervals. This distribution is presented in terms 
of average density. The method uses three assumptions based 
on gear studies at the Exploratory Fishing and 
Gear Research Base at Pascagoula (Wathne 
and Holt, 1964) and on prior explorations on 
the Continental Slope (Schroeder, 1955). 
These assumptions are: (1) that a flat trawl, 
regardless of size, if it be towed at about 2.5 
knots, has an effective fishing width of 60 
percent of the head rope length (for example, 
that a 12.2-meter trawl actually covers 7.3 
meters on the bottom); (2) that the net tends 
bottom continuou sly over unobstructed bottom; 
and (3) that the net descends and ascends at 
constant rates relative to speed of vessel, size 
of gear, depth of water, and length of warp. 
This method perhaps oversimplifies the anal­
ysis, because some variation is no doubt pre­
sent; but the method is as exacting as is now 
feasible. 
Bullis (1956) and Bullis and Rathjen 
(1959) have given detailed accounts of the ves­
sels, gear, and operations used in the collection 
of the data. 
[2] Results.-The most produc­
tive area of the St. Augustine grounds lies be­
tween latitude 28 °30' and 30°20' North. Al­
though shrimp are distributed between 220 and 
550 meters, concentr ations occur from 275 to 
420 meters (Figure 5). Highest densities are 
found at 290 and 380 meters; lesser densities, 
from 330 to 348 meters. Shrimp are not a­
bundant in water shallower than 256 meters 
or deeper than 550.

(b) Seasonal depth distribution. 
[1] Method.--Seasonal changes 
in the average density distribution were deter­
mined by grouping the data into 3-month per­
iods (seasons) before calculating densities. 
The grouped data were then treated in 18.3-
meter intervals in the same manner as were 
those used to obtain the average density dis­
tribution. This seasonal grouping is presented 
in the paper as seasonal density distribution. 
The months representing the individual seasons 
were chosen on the basis of climatic similarity 
--winter (December , January, February) ; 
spring (March, April, May); summer (June, 
July, August); and fall (September, October, 
November) . 
[2] Results.-Figure 6 shows 
the monthly trends in the distribution of the 
shrimp. Densities are low during December 
through April. Beginning in late spring, the 
density of the St. Augustine grounds increases 
until a plateau is reached between July and 
September. During the fall, the concentration 
disperses until an annual minimum density is 
reached in December. 
High densities occur at depths that vary 
seasonally some 90 meters (Figure 7). In 
the spring, densities of shrimp are highest at 
275 to 340 meters. From spring to summer, 
shrimp move into deeper water, concentratin g 
between 320 to 430 meters, and are at their Figure 6.-Seasonal variation in royal-red 
shrimp density plotted with a 
moving average of 3. 
greatest density during that time of year. In 
the fall, densities decrease, and shrimp move 
into shallo·wer water where the peak density 
is at 320 meters. The winter population is 
distributed bimodally between 256 and 420 
meters with peaks at 275 and 415 meters. 
Though the general movement of shrimp in 
the fall is toward shallow water, a concentra­
tion that seems inconsistent with the excepted 
seasonal pattern develops during the winter 
from 355 to 450 meters. The concentra tions 
reached in deeper water and the wide distri­
bution of shrimp over the entire grounds in­
dicate that recruitment may take place from 
other g ounds. A logical source would be the 
Dry Tortugas, since the general direction of 
bottom currents away from there could carry 
larval shrimp eastwardly through the Florida 
Straits and up the east coast of Florida. 
(2) Relation of shrimp density to bot­
tom temperature.--Bottom temperatures were 
obtained with standard reversing thermome­
ters graduated in degrees Celsius. 
Maximum shrimp densities occur in water 
temperatures of about 9.50 C. (Figure 8). 
Shrimp are distributed over a temperature 
range of 7.50 to 10.00 C.; below 8.00 C. shrimp 
are scattered. No shrimp were taken in 255 
meters or less when temperatures were above 
10.00 C. Because the bottom is hard inside 
of the 255-meter contour, it is difficult to say

Figure 7.-Seasonal depth distribution of royal-red shrimp density on the study grounds. 
which factor, sub trate or temperature, is more 
limiting on the St. Augustine grounds. 
The high densities of shrimp occurring in 
from 275 to 380 meters indicate that the royal­
red shrimp on the St. Augustine grounds prefer 
.~ water temperature of 9.5° C. Further, the 
similar depth range (256 to 475 meters) of 
the 8.0° to 10.0° C. interval and the depth dis­
tribution of the shrimp indicate that bottom 
temperature sets a limitation on their distri­
bution. 
B. GROUNDS IN THE 
GULF OF MEXICO 
Two grounds in the Gulf of Mexico support 
commercia l quantities of royal-red shrimp. 
These grounds are off Dry Tortugas and Mis­
sissippi River Delta. 
1. Dry Tortugas Grounds 
Described in this section are the grounds 
and the distribution of shrimp. 
168 o. Physical description of grounds. -The 
grounds described here lie south-southwest of 
the Dry Tortugas along the Florida Straits be­
tween longitudes 82°20' and 84 °00' West (Fig­
ure 2). The distance between the 185-and 550-
meter depth interval averages 5.9 nautical 
miles and has the steepest angle of slope among 
the three grounds studied (Figure 3). 
Between 185 and 275 meters, the bottom 
is calcareous, broken with coral formations, and 
generally unsuitable for trawling. From 275 
to beyond 550 meters, the calcareous bottom 
changes to gray-green coralline mud, which 
provides excellent trawling (Agassiz, 1888; 
Bullis, 1956). The eastern and western bor­
ders of the grounds are untrawlable because of 
large patches of the coral Sty laster. 
Figure 4 shows the annual thermal gradient 
of the Dry Tortugas grounds. The 12° C. iso­
therm lies at the depth of about 185 meters, 
the 11 ° C. isotherm at a depth of 275 meters, 
and the 10° C. isotherm at a depth of 330 me­
ters. This separation of whole-degree isotherms 
by 55 to 95 meters continues throughout the grounds. The 9° C. c nt ur i a

cur at d pth r bottom temperatures approach 9.5° C. (Figure 
8). Densities are lower in water of 8.5° to 9.0° 
C. and 10.0° to 10.5° C., beyond which shrimp 
are not abundant. Warmer waters lie in the 
shallow portion of the grounds where, as on 
the St. Augustine grounds, the bottom is hard 
and is not inhabited by shrimp. Therefore, 
an upper-thermal limit cannot be determined 
accurately. As is evident from Figure 7, the 
lower-therma l limit is about 8.0° C. 
The 9.5° C. isotherm is between 365 and 385 
meters on the Tortugas grounds. The depth 
range of shrimp, 275 to over 550 meters, cor­
responds to a range in temperature of 7.5° to 
11.0° C. 
2. Mississippi Delta Grounds 
This section describes the grounds and dis­
tribution of shrimp. 
o. Physical description of grounds. -The 
l\h~;:,issippi Delta grounds ar in the north 
'entral Gulf of Mexico southeast of the Mis­
;issippi River Delta between longitudes 87°15' 
and 89°50' West. The average width of the 
grounds between the 185-and 550-meter depth 
interval is 10.4 nautical miles (Figure 3). The 
<lngle of slope is quite gradual. 
The bottom topography over the entire 
grounds is relatively smooth except for the 
eastern and western boundaries, which con­
tain patches of the coral Lophelia, (Moore and 
Bullis, 1960). The sediments of these grounds 
are of terrigeno us origin consisting of a fine 
silt-clay mixture that is extremely cohesive 
and that often contains small quantities of shell 
fragments. Both the nature of the bottom sed­
iments and the occurrence of occasional topo­
graphical disturbances (Bullis, 1956) indicate 
the influence of the Mississippi River on the 
grounds. Trawling conditions are generally 
excellent over the grounds except on the east 
and west fringes in water deeper than 550 
meters, where the bottom is precipitous and 
hard. 
Figure 4 shows an annual temperature pro­
file that is deeper and more gradual than that 
of the other grounds. For example, the 12° C. 
isotherm, lying in 275 meters, is 55 meters 
170 deeper than that of the St. Augustine grounds 
and 90 meters deeper than that of the Dry 
Tortugas grounds. At 400 meters, the bottom 
temperature is 10° C. on the Delta grounds 
as compared with 8.5° C. on the St. Augustine 
grounds and 9° C. on the Dry Tortugas grounds. 
Conversely, the 9° C. isotherm is at 455 meters; 
the 8° C. isotherm, at 550 meters. 
b. Shrimp distribution. -Presented in this 
section are the relation of shrimp density to 
depth distribution and relation of shrimp den­
sity to bottom temperature. 
(1) Relation of shrimp density to depth 
distributio n.-I discus first average depth dis­
tribution and then seasonal depth distribution. 
(a) Averag d pth distribution.­
Shrimp on the Mi si sippi Delta grounds are 
distributed primarily between longitudes 87° 
3 ' and 89°30' We t in water 275 to over 550 
m tel's deep; howev r, density is highest at 
330 to 475 meters with peaks at 365, 410, and 
460 meters (Figure 5). Shrimp are less con­
centrated on these grounds than on the St. 
Augu tine or Dry Tortugas grounds despite 
the larger geographi cal area of the Delta 
grounds and the broad depth distribution of 
the species. The ubstrate limitations in this 
area do not appear to be as extensive as are 
those on the St. Augustine or Dry Tortugas 
ground. 
(b) Seasonal depth distribution. -
The levels of density are less easonally differ­
entiated on these grounds than are those on 
the other grounds, and the transition between 
minimum and maximum levels is generally sev­
eral months in duration (Figure 6). The low­
est density occurs during January through 
March after a rapid decline from the plateau 
of maximum concentration maintained from 
September to November. 
The main seasonal effect on the royal-red 
shrimp is a change in the depth distribution of 
maximum density (Figure 7). In winter and 
spring the high densities occur at 370 and 390 
meters, whereas in summer and fall the high 
densities occur at 460 and 440 meters. This 
seasonal movement indicates that the temper­
atures of water at those depths undergo normal cycles of heating and cooling. Unfortunately, 
data on seasonal bottom temperature are not 
available to test this hypothesis . 
(2) Relation of shrimp density to bot­
tom temperatures. -The relation between 
shrimp density and water temperature in the 
Mississippi Delta area is similar to that on 
the other grounds (Figure 8). Shrimp are 
most concentrated at 9.00 to 10.50 C., but they 
do not show a preference for a temperature of 
9.50 C. as do those on the other grounds. The 
absence of a 9.50 C. peak, however, may reflect 
the oscillating movement of shrimp between 
365 and 455 meters and the broad depth distri-bution of the 9.00 to 10.50 C. temperature 
range. Shrimp become increasingly scattered 
on either end of the 9.00 to 10.50 C. range, and 
the 80 C. isotherm appears to set a lower-ther­
mal limit. The 12.00 C. isotherm, which lies in 
275 meters where the bottom is soft and ap­
parently well-suited for royal-red shrimp, is 
apparently approaching the upper-thermal 
limit for the species. 
The 275-to 550-meter depth range of shrimp 
on these grounds coincides with an 8.00 to 12.50 
C. temperature range, which is comparable to 
the depth-temperature relation found on the 
other grounds studied. 
II. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE THREE POTENTIAL 
COMMERCIAL GROUNDS 
In this section, the role of the environment, 
the substrate as a limiting factor, and the ef­
fect of bottom temperature are considered. 
A. ROLE OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
Shrimp occurred in higher densities on some 
grounds than on others. Although this var­
iability is difficult to explain completely , the 
distribution of shrimp on the grounds can be 
related in part to the amount of environmental 
disturbance s on the study grounds. 
The Mississippi Delta grounds have the low­
est densities of royal-red shrimp among the 
grounds studied. A reason for these low den­
sities can be inferred from the observations of 
van Andel and Curray (1960), who found that 
active sedimentation and deposition around the 
Mississippi Delta produce severe topographical 
changes on the outer shelf and upper slope. The 
constant deposition of fluvial material also 
causes a gradual expansion of the Continental 
Shelf; which, with sedimentation and deposi­
tion, produce mud slides, erosion, and other 
substrate disturbances that interfere with the 
permanent establishment of faunal populations. 
These environmental disturbances appar­
ently do not exist elsewhere in the Gulf of Mex­
ico; hence, the Dry Tortugas grounds offer a more stable substrate than does the Mississippi 
Delta grounds. This difference is reflected in 
the higher densities and limited vertical move­
ment of the royal-red shrimp in the Dry Tor­
tugas grounds. Undoubtedl y, these grounds 
are affected by the Florida Current, which 
bathes the area with a gentle eastwardly flow, 
but its effects do not appear to be detrimental. 
Although little is known of the slope en­
vironment of the east coast of Florida, it can be 
presumed to be influenced primarily by the 
Gulf Stream. Current velocities of the Gulf 
Stream have not been measured on the St. 
Augustine grounds, but studies off Cape Hat­
teras, North Carolina, showed that a current 
of 1.0 knot occurred at a depth of 400 meters 
(Stommel, 1965). If this speed approximates 
current velocities off Florida, and nothing in­
dicates that it does not, then the Gulf Stream 
certainly does not harmfully affect the slope 
community. The high concentrations of shrimp 
on the St. Augustine grounds indicate a rel­
atively stable environment in contrast to that 
of the Delta grounds. 
B. SUBSTRATE AS A LIMITING 
FACTOR 
The composition of the bottom has been 
shown to limit the geographical and bathy-
171 metric distribution of royal-red shrimp. This 
relation is best illustrated by the 1,500 explora­
tory fishing stations made on the Continental 
Slope of the southern United States from Cape 
Hatteras to Brownsville, Texas, the great ma­
jority of which produced royal-red shrimp only 
on sand, silty-sand, and other soft sediments. 
On rare occasions, small numbers of shrimp 
were taken over limestone or coralline bottom 
contiguous to soft-bottom areas. The transi­
tion from soft to hard substrate on the upper 
reaches of the St. Augustine and Dry Tortugas 
grounds seems to present a barrier to exten­
sive shrimp distributio n and can be considered 
as being a possible example of the limiting 
characteristics of certain types of bottom. 
Royal red shrimp occur on sand, silty-sand, 
terrigenous, and calcareous sediments and show 
no apparent preference for a particular sed­
iment. The species is widely distributed on the 
Continental Slope wherever soft bottoms occur; 
however, large concentrations have not been 
found outside the study areas. 
C. EFFECTS OF BOTTOM 
TEMPERA TURE 
Large aggregations of royal-red shrimp 
occur on the grounds only within the narrow 
temperature range at 9° to 10° C., and densities are highest at about 9.5° C. Below go and 
above 12° C., royal-red shrimp are highly scat­
tered. 
The depth distribution of royal-red shrimp 
is related to the location of the 9° to 10° C. 
range. Because of the location of the optimum 
temperature range, shrimp on the St. Augus­
tine grounds are concentrated at shallower 
depths than are those on the Mississippi Delta 
grounds. 
Since complete data are not available, the 
effects of bottom temperature on seasonal 
shrimp distributions are speculative. Some 
influence can be shown by a phenomenon ob­
served in winter on the Dry Tortugas when 
shrimp were evenly distributed from 365 to 550 
meters. At that time, the 9° C. isotherm was 
found to lie in 365 to 495 meters. The broad 
configuration of this isotherm would seem to 
permit a wide dispersion of shrimp in contrast 
to the dispersion in other seasons when the 
optimum temperature range occurs at a rela­
tively narrow depth zone. 
Changes in the temperature structure, such 
as was noted above, undoubtedly contribute to 
the annual and seasonal variations in faunal 
distribution; however, other environmental 
and biological factors, which are now poorly 
understood, may directly influence the distribu­
tion of royal-red shrimp. 
CONCLUSIONS 
1. The distribution of royal-red shrimp 
is restricted to soft-bottom types and to water 
temperatures of 8° to 12° C. The highest con­
centration of the shrimp is in water tempera­
tures of 9° to 10° C. The variations in the 
depths at which the 9° to 10° C. range occurs 
among the grounds result in shrimp being 
found in shallow water on the St. Augustine 
grounds, intermediate water on the Dry Tor­
tugas grounds, and deep water on the Missis­
sippi Delta grounds. 
2. The densities of shrimp vary seasonally 
on all three grounds. Late summer and fall 
172 are periods of high density on the St. Augustine 
and Mississippi Delta grounds; whereas, late 
spring and summer are periods of high density 
on the Dry Tortugas grounds. 
3. The depth distribution of shrimp also 
varies seasonally, for the shrimp move offshore 
in summer and inshore in winter. Shrimp oc­
cur at depths of 255 to 550 meters on the St. 
Augustine grounds, at depths of 275 to over 
550 meters on the Dry Tortugas, and at depths 
of 275 to over 550 meters on the Mississippi 
Delta area. Within each of these ranges, the 
seasonal variation in concentration is consi­
derable. ulli

MS. #1913 EFFECT OF VARYING THE 
EXTRACTION PROCEDURE ON THE 
PROTEIN EXTRACTABILITY OF 
FROZEN-STORED FISH MUSCLE 
by 
Elinor M. Ravesi and Margaret L. Anderson 
ABSTRACT 
The amount of extractab le protein in frozen-stored fish mu cle is often used a a cri­
terion of its textural quality. An assessment of the texture of fi h mu cle by an orga­
noleptic test panel, however, often shows poor correlation with the amount of protein that 
is extracted from the muscle. 
Be ause we hypothesize d that the amount of protein that can be extracted from frozen 
fish muscle depends, in large part, upon the technique of extraction used, we studied th 
effects of varying the solubility-test procedure , using one lot of frozen-stored cod mu cleo 
Depending on the length of time that the sample was blended and the concentr ation of 
the neutral-s alt extractant used, the amount of extractable protein varied between (1) 
values considered to represent minimum extractability in frozen cod mu cle that ha 
undergone extensive textural deterioration and (2) values considered to be typical of re­
cently frozen cod. 
These contradictory results indicate a need for standardizing the extraction procedur . 
We believe that such standardization will minimize the lack of correlation now found in 
the literature between the content of soluble protein and the extent that the texture of 
frozen fish muscle has deteriorated as evaluated organoleptically.

1 Trode names referred to in this publication do not Imply endorse­
ment of any commerci al product but are cited to promote full under­
standing of the type of equipment used, Recent studies by us, however, on cod muscle 
aged in ice showed that, during the extraction 
procedure, complexes of protein with free fatty 
acid are dissociated and that exposure to the 
salt solution breaks down the resistance of the 
muscle to fragmentation (Anderson and Ra­
vesi, 1968). This finding suggests that the 
concentration of salt and the length of time 
that the muscle is blended are important fac­
tors in the solubility test and that they may 
markedly influence the amount of protein ex-tracted, especially from frozen-stored fish. 
The purpose of the present study was to 
test this possibility by using some of the var­
iations of the solubility test found in the lit­
erature in order to assess the extractable pro­
tein content of a single lot of frozen-stored 
cod muscle. Because length of blending time, 
concentration of salt, and physical state of the 
tissue are the variables most likely to differ 
in the various extraction procedures, we have 
considered these variables in our present stUdy. 
I. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In the general extraction procedure, sam­
ples of myotomes were blended with the ex­
tractants to produce homogenat es that were 
subsequently analyzed for their content of 
soluble protein. 
A. MATERIALS 
Our choice of materials for this study was 
based on results of extraction studies made at 
both our laboratory and other laboratories. 
The history of the myotome samples is not in 
itself critical inasmuch as all the samples used 
had identical histories. The extractants used 
in the study are those most commonly used in 
extraction studies of this nature. 
1. Myotome Samples 
About 15 gutted cod (Gadus morhua) 
weighing about 15 to 25 pounds (6.8 to 11.3 
kilograms) each and obtained commercially 
were stored on ice until they were filleted within 
24 hours after they were caught. Myotomes 
were obtained from them by the method de­
scribed by Ironside and Love (1958). The 
myotomes from all the fish were mixed to­
gether thoroughly, and 10-gram portions were 
weighed into aluminum weighing dishes. These 
portions were vacuum packaged in polyethylene 
bags in sets of three to provide triplicate 
samples for analysis. The myotome samples 
were immediately froz~n at -290 C. for 1 day, 
were stored for 1 month at -180 C. (on one 
occasion, the temperature rose to -120 C. for 
about 3 days), and then were kept for an 
additional 7 months at -290 C. 2. Extractants 
Three different extractant solutions were 
used. Their compositions were: (1) 5-per­
cent NaCI (0.86M), 0.02M NaHCOJ (Dyer, 
French, and Snow, 1950); (2) 3.5-percent 
NaCI (0.6M), 0.003M NaHCO J (Dyer, Brock­
erhoff, Hoyle, and Fraser, 1964); and (3) 3.35-
percent KCI (0.45M), 0.0157M Na2HP04, 
0.0031M KH2P04 (Connell, 1958). The pH of 
these solutions fell within the range 7.0 to 7.5. 
B. METHODS OF ANALYSIS 
As was just indicated, all samples were an­
alyzed in triplicate. Protein was extracted 
from myotomes in the frozen state and in the 
thawed state. 
When myotomes were extracted in the fro­
zen state, the samples were allowed to soften in 
the salt solution for 2% minutes before blend­
ing was started. 
When myotomes were extracted in the 
thawed state, frozen samples were kept at an 
ambient temperature of about 260 C. until they 
thawed, whereupon they were blended imme­
diately. 
For each analysis, a 10-gram portion of 
myotomes was blended with 390 milliliters of 
extractant solution. The samples were blended 
in a pint-size (.47-liter size) Waring Blendor 
jar that had been fitted with a plexiglass baffle 
that, in turn, was submerged about 1 inch 
(2.54 centimeters) below the surface of the 
extractant to prevent the extractant from foam-
177 ing. The extraction was carried out in a r -
frigerated laboratory at 10 C. with all equip­
ment and solutions equilibrated to this temper­
ature. The blending time shown in Table 1 
was made up of 10-second intervals of blending 
separated by 5-second intervals of stirring. A portion of the muscle-extractant homogenate 
was centrifuged at 1,100 times gravity for 20 
minutes in a r frig rat d centrifuge at 10 C.

tions w r assay d by the automated t chnique 
d cribed by Failing, Buckley, and Zak (1960).

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Table 1 shows the re ults of this extl'action 
study. 
The soluble-pl'otein contents of the extrac­
tion mixtures made from the three diffel' nt alt 
solutions shov\' the hol'izontal and vertical 
trends that OUl' expel'ience had led us to expect 
--that is, in both the fl'ozen and thawed amples, 
the amount of extracted pl'otein increased 
markedly with increasing blending time and 
increasing concentration of salt. 
Considering the lengthy period that these 
samples were in frozen storage, we can assume 
that much denaturation of protein occurred . 
Depending upon the treatment u ed, however, 
anywhere from 23.4 to 70.6 percent of protein 
was extractable. A sample of cod in which the 
concentrat ion of extractab le protein was only 
23.4 percent would be expected to be quite dry, 
tough, and unacceptable to a test panel; con­
versely, a sample in which the concentration 
of extractable protein was 70.6 percent would 
be expected to have recently been frozen and 
to be highly acceptable. 
178 Becau e on sample cannot simultaneou Iy 
ha \'e both et of propel'tie , the te t obviou ly 
lack precision. D pending upon the condition 
of the solubility te t u ed, the amount of ex­
tl'aclabl l)l'otein in thi sample would hov. 
varying degree of COlT lation with an organ­
oleptic evaluation of it textural quality. This 
variability would explain the different degrees 
of correlation found by individual investigators 
using even slightly different techniques of ex­
traction. 
The frozen sample , although allowed to sit 
in the salt solution fOl' 21;2 minutes before being 
blended, were still partially frozen at the time 
that blending was commenced, so that the a­
mount of exposure of the tissue to the action 
of the blades was actually decreased, but only 
briefly. On the other hand, investigators using 
this technique state that it has the advantao'e 
<=> 
of lessening the build up of heat during the 
blending process. (Such a build up, of course, 
would lower the amount of protein extracted.) From our results, drawing any conclusions 
concerning the overall effect of the physical 
state of the sample on the amount of protein 
that is extractable is difficult, because the dif­
ferences between the compara ble frozen and 
thawed samples often were small, and the dif­
ferences varied inconsistently. 
These inconsistencies were probably due, 
in large part, to the different operational effi­
ciencies of the individual Waring Blendor jars 
used and to variations in the samples. Two 
samples cannot be treated identically when dif­
ferent blendor jars are used. In fact, the same 
jar may not perform with equal efficiency dur­
ing two different blending operations. Con­
stant maintenance of the jars by adjustment and replacement of bearings, washers, and 
blades can minimize this variation. 
Table 2 shows the variation in results ob­
tained when triplicate samples of muscle were 
treated identically except that different Waring 
Blendor jars were used.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
Depending upon the concentration of salt 
of the extractant used and the length of time 
that the myotome s were blended, the amount 
of protein extracted from a single sample of 
frozen-stored fish muscle varied markedly. 
Accordingly, investigators using different tech­
niques of extraction will find varying degrees 
of correlation between the concentration of 
extractable protein in a sample and its texture 
as assessed by a panel of organoleptic testers. 
The lack of validity of the solubility test 
thus is due, in large part, to the fact that the 
conditions of the test have not been rigidly 
defined. Thus, because a wide variety of re­
sults can be obtained with different techniques of extraction, researchers in this field should 
try to devise a standardized procedure that will 
show good correlation between the concentra­
tion of extractable protein and texture as de­
termined by an organoleptic panel. 
More than one set of conditions, however, 
may e needed. That is, different species of 
fish may require different sets of conditions. 
Furthermore, fish stored, say, at 00 C. may 
respond differently from fish 3tored at -300 C. 
We believe that standard ization of the sol­
ubility test would not only increase its value 
as an objective test of quality but that it would 
also make comparisons of the work of different 
investigators easier.

Because of the rapid growth of science, the scien­
tific literature doubles in size about every 10 years. 
Accordingly, a scientist, to keep up with his field, 
must be highly selective in what he read. and must 
read rapidly. We are trying to design FisheTY In­
dgstrial Resea1'ch to help the reader meet these two 
needs. 
To help a reader be selective, we present him 
"'ith a three-sentence abstract at th beginning of 
each report. The first sentence states the problem 
that needed solution, the second sentence tells what 
\I'as done about the problem, and the third sentence 
re\"eals the payoff of the research. With that in­
formation, the reader can quickly decide whether 
reading the report will be worth his time. 
To help him read rapidly, we use several tech­
niques. The most important of these is to reveal 
the structure, or plan, of the research to him in the 
opening part of the report, because to get a quick 
comprehensive grasp of the report, he must know 
\I'hat the plan of the research was. 
\Ve therefore recommend that, in writing a re­
port for Fishery hldustn'al ReSNl'1'ch, you reveal 
the plan of your research early in the report and, 
furtphrmo re, that you thereafter keep the plan prom­
inentlv before the reader, so that he cannot become 
confu~e d about it. To accomplish these ends, you 
will need to use the same plan, or outline, for your 
report that you used for your research. A suming, 
for example, that your overall research involved two 
closely related experiments --Experiments I and II 
--\I'e recommend that you use the following outline: 
-TITLE OF THE OVERALL RESEARCH 
Introduction (states the need for. and precise purpose of, 
the overall research and reveals its main 
divisions) 
I. Title of Experime nt I 
A. Materials and methods used in Experiment 
B. Results from Experiment I and discussion of the 
data 
II. Title of Experiment II 
A. Materials and methods used in Experimen t II 
B. Results from Experiment II and discussion of the 
data 
Discussion of, and conclusions from, the a~erall research 
I ntraductian (states the need for. and precISe purpose of, 
the overall research and reveals its main 
divisions) Thus, w do not r commend th following outline, 
though it is commonly us d: 
TITLE OF THE OVERALL RESEARCH 
I. Procedure 
A. Materials 
B. Methods 
II. Results and discussion 
A. Resulls of Experimen t I (plus any information 
needed on materials and melhads to make the 
results clear) 
B. Results of Experimen t II (plus any information 
needed on materials and methods to make the 
results clear) 
ote that if you were to use the second outline, 
you would not reveal th plan of the research to 
the reader until h reads your re ults and discussion. 
E,'en then, you may not reveal the plan unless you 
present the re ults of each experim nt separately, as 
indicated in the econd outline. If you present them 
as a unit, as often is done, you may not reveal the 
plan of the research at any point in your report, 
In that event, the reader will have to figure back­
ward from your tables and graphs and perhaps re­
read your report several times in order to infer the 
plan. Such inferences take time that he cannot 
afford to spend. So, to give the reader a quick 
gra p of your report, u e the same plan for your 
report that you used for your re earch, as indicated 
in the outline recommended.

A. APPROACH 
Write your paper for a reader who has had advanced 
scientific training . Organize and write it in such a way 
that he can read it rapidly, yet understand it the first time 
through . 
B. COMPONENTS OF THE PAPER 
1. Title 
Select a title that reveals the overall purpose of your 
research. When appropriate, include scientific names of 
species. 
2. Abstract 
Make the abstract semidescriptive: tell what the report 
is about, and end with a statement of your overall conclusion . 
(This conclusion will answer the question stated, or implied, 
by your overall purpose.) Keep the abstract short, but do 
not use the title of the paper as the assumed antecedent 
of otherwise irrefera ble pronouns. 
3. Contents 
Include a table of contents . 
4. Introductio n 
In the introduction, (1) orient the reader to your over­
all purpose, (Z) state the purpose explicitl y, (3) orient 
the reader to the subpurposes, and (4) end with a listing 
of the subpurposes. 
Include in each orienting discussion all the important 
words that will occur in the subsequent statement of purpose. 
Avoid unnecessary reviews and economic data. 
When stating the overall purpose, include a word such 
as "purpose " so that the reader can quickly identify the 
statement for what it is. 
5. Main Divisions 
Do not use such generali zed divisions as "Experimental. " 
Instead, be specific by making the main divisions of the 
paper correspond to the main divisions of your research ­
Experiment I, Experiment II, and so on. Give each ex­
periment a specific title so that the reader will gain imme­
diate insight into the scope of the experiment. 
For main divisions , do not use "Materials," "Procedures," 
and "Results" (except when, as is rare, your paper reports 
only a single unit of research , such as Experiment I); in­
stead, use these headings for minor divisions . When you 
use them, consider the following suggestions: 
a. Materials and methods.-Descr ibe in detail the ma­
terials and the methods used in your first experiment. If 
the materials and methods used in succeeding experiments 
are similar to those in the first, merely describe the dif­
ferences when you report the succeeding experiments. 
If a method includes several closely consecutive steps, 
number them and write out the steps; use the active voice 
-for example, "In the separation of acids from the aqueous 
phase, the analyst: 
l. Neutralized a I-milliliter portion of the aqueous 
layer to a pH of 10 with 0.1 N NaOH. 
Z. Transferred the neutralized solution to Flask A. 
3. Placed Flask A in a bath .. ' " 
b. Results.-Report all numerical data in tables and 
graphs--avo id cluttering the text with numbers. In the 
discussion of results, do not repeat the data that' are con-
. ed in the tables and graphs. Instead, analyze the data 
by pointing out significances and implications. Use sum­
mary tables; do not overwhelm the reader with unnecessary 
tables of raw data. 6. Conclusions 
Draw conclusions from your results. 
the overall conclusion and the subconclu 
with your overall purpose and lubpurpo 
conclusions in logical sequence . 
7. Summary 
End the report with a summ ry. Mak the ummary 
quantitative, not merely descriptive . If the i-eport II hort, 
end it with "Summary and Conclusions." If it is lon, 
separate the two. 
8. Acknowledgment 
Avoid titles of individual9--such as mister, doctor, or 
professor. Simply acknowledge the assistanc received . 
9. literature Cited 
Make your citatiorts complete and accurate so th 1" del" 
can find the original with ease. Follow the format u d 
in Fishery Industrial Res arch. 
C. MECHANICS 
1. Abbreviations 
Avoid abbreviations unless you have comp lIing re son 
to use them-for example, if you lack space in your t bles. 
If you use abbreviations, use the ones standard in your 
discipline . End the abbreviation with a period. See the 
latest issue of Fishery Industrial Resea1·ch . 
2. English Usage, Punctuation, and Capitalization 
Meticulous ly follow established practice in gr mmar, 
punctuation , and capitalization. For precise, forceful It te­
ments, use per~onal pronouns where appropriate and thereby 
avoid illogical constructions or ambiguities. 
3. Heading s 
Use the system of headings shown 10 the latest edition 
of Fishery Illdustrial Research. 
4. Numbers 
Use Arabic numbers unless you have a compelling re 54 n 
to use Roman numbers or to write the numbers out. See 
the latest issue of Fishery Industrial Res arch. 
5. Tables and Graphs 
a. Tables.-Number each table and give it a title. (Th 
title, placed at the tOP of the table, is a brief stat ment 
of such applicable referents as the nature, classlfic tlon, 
or chronology of the information presented, and the polit­
ical diviSIOn , geographical area, or physical plant to which 
the data refer. These points are someomes referr d to 
as the "what," "how classified," "when," and "wher " of 
the table.) Do not place a period at the end of the title. 
When headings apply to information in more than I col. 
umn, word them so that they reveal the meantn of the 
data in all columns covered. Place all units of measurement 
over figure columns, and underline. Separate all columns 
with vertical lines, but use hOrizontal Imes and footnOl I 
sparingly . Place each table on a sep race p ge. the 
latest issue of Fishery Industrial ReB rch.

wording the title, follow the su estions for oclu of bl
