Treatment wetlands are ecological systems that are engineered to improve polluted water quality 21 
through macrophyte, soil, and microbial remediation  and are used commonly for urban and 22 
agricultural runoff treatment. However, constructed  wetlands used for marine aquaculture 23 
effluent treatments are understudied when compared to their freshwater counterpart. We 24 
compared the nutrient retention and the microbial c ommunities of two types of constructed 25 
wetland mesocosms, a vertical-flow treatment wetlan d (VFTW) and floating treatment wetland 26 
(FTW) in subtropical south Florida. To enhance nutr ient retention efficiency, we implemented 27 
biodegradable plastic (polycaprolactone), as an ext ernal carbon source and monitored the 28 
performance of VFTW and FTW for the treatment of ma rine aquaculture effluent. 29 
Polycaprolactone surface were covered by various cy anobacterial genera including Oscillatoria , 30 
Leptolyngbya , Brasilonema , and Trichormus  and some plastic-degrading bacteria such as 31 
Pseudomonas . The presence of a biodegradable plastic in FTW im proved the overall 32 
performance of nitrogen removal (nitrite plus nitra te) by 14% through denitrification. The pattern 33 
of nutrient removal between two treatment wetland m esocosms were significantly different (p ˂ 34 
0.01), with over 87-91% retention of total nitrogen  in VFTW and no retention in FTW, the latter 35 
due to poor retention of nitrite plus nitrate and p roduction of organic nitrogen from the system 36 
not present in inflow waters. Total phosphorus was retained in both mesocosm types, with higher 37 
retention (74-81%) in the VFTW than in the FTW (17- 40%). The nutrient retention in VFTW 38 
was higher overall compared with FTW mesocosms rega rdless of biodegradable plastic presence. 39

 59 1. INTRODUCTION 60 
Wetland construction or wetland restoration has bee n effective in water quality 61 
enhancement through nutrient reductions from agricu ltural and urban runoff (Fink and Mitsch, 62 
2004; Nahlik and Mitsch, 2006; Mitsch et al., 2012,  2015; Griffiths and Mitsch, 2017). 63 
Treatment wetlands are ecological systems that are engineered to treat polluted water through 64 
macrophyte, soil, and microbial remediation and hav e some varieties (Vymazal, 2007). Vertical- 65 
flow treatment wetlands (VFTWs) are fed inflows int ermittently or continuously with a relatively 66 
short hydraulic residence time (Stottmeister et al. , 2003; De Lange et al., 2013) and effective for 67 
solids removal from the water column and nutrient c ycling by means of phytoremediation and 68 
microbial processes (e.g. denitrification and nitri fication) (Fuchs et al., 2011; De Lange et al., 69 
2013).  70 
A floating treatment wetland (FTW) is a relatively new phytoremediation technique to 71 
reduce the impact of excess nutrient loading within  the waterbody itself. FTWs consist of aquatic 72 
or terrestrial plants grown hydroponically on a flo ating mat directly in the open water of the 73 
system allowing for direct treatment of eutrophic w aters (Hubbard et al., 2004; Vymazal, 2007; 74 
Headley and Tanner, 2011; Zhao et al., 2012; Olguín  et al., 2017; Pavlineri et al., 2017). The 75 
plant roots are exposed directly to the water colum n instead of buried in a sand or gravel 76 
substrate allowing for nutrients to be absorbed hyd roponically, reducing the nutrient load 77 
internally (Zhou and Wang, 2010; Headley and Tanner , 2011; White and Cousins, 2013). The 78 
development of an extensive root system along with microbial biofilm formation provide for the 79 
main nutrient removal pathway in this type of wetla nd system (Headley and Tanner, 2011). 80 
FTWs have been shown to be effective at treatment o f high nutrient wastewaters (e.g. 81 
stormwater, sewage, agriculture) (Headley and Tanne r, 2011; Yeh et al., 2015; Chen et al., 82 2016). Plant roots have a greater surface area expo sure in the water column, which allow for 83 
greater bacterial colonization and unique rhizosphe re microbial functions (Zhao et al., 2012; 84 
White and Cousins, 2013; Urakawa et al., 2017). The se two wetland designs (VFTW and FTW) 85 
have been proven to be effective for agriculture an d storm water treatments (Faulwetter et al., 86 
2011; Zhang et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2017; Urakawa et al., 2017). 87 
Since treatment wetlands have been specifically des igned for wastewater treatment 88 
removing high nutrients and suspended solids (Turci os and Papenbrock, 2014; Mitsch and 89 
Gosselink, 2015), it is possible to apply treatment  wetlands to remediate aquaculture wastewater 90 
as a cost-effective approach (Brown et al., 1999; L in et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2017). One of the 91 
most common treatment wetlands for aquaculture effl uent is characterized as subsurface flow 92 
construction, which has a sand or gravel substrate,  where water flows either vertically (vertical- 93 
flow) or horizontally (horizontal-flow), and treate d water is either reused in a closed system or 94 
discharged in an open system (Konnerup et al., 2011 ; Mitsch and Gosselink, 2015). 95 
Enhancement of aquaculture wastewater treatment cap acity could be possible through the 96 
addition of various external carbon sources such as  methanol, glucose, starch, and cellulose (Wu 97 
et al., 2014). Several studies aimed to explore dif ferent denitrification activity with external 98 
carbon in constructed wetlands, use of periphyton a s a producer of organic carbon (Sirivedhin 99 
and Gray, 2006), and addition of different sugars ( e.g. glucose and fructose) to wetland influents 100 
(Lin et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2009).  101 
Using biodegradable plastic as an external carbon s ource in treatment wetlands is a new 102 
approach and two benchtop scale wetland microcosms were previously designed with the use of 103 
a cornstarch/polycaprolactone blend (Shen et al., 2 015) and poly-3-hydroxybutryate-co-3- 104 
hydroxyvalerate/polyacetic acid (PHBV/PLA) (Yang et  al., 2018). However, no application has 105 been made in a medium scale outdoor treatment wetla nd and understanding the microbial 106 
community composition in a treatment wetland with b iodegradable plastic is the next question to 107 
improve the performance of nutrient removal. 108 
In this study, we evaluated nutrient retention effi ciency between vertical-flow and 109 
floating treatment wetland mesocosms with and witho ut biodegradable plastic 110 
(polycaprolactone) for treatment of marine aquacult ure effluent to enhance nutrient cycling (e.g. 111 
denitrification). Likewise, determining how microbi al community composition could change 112 
with the addition of a biodegradable plastic and ho w microbial community composition differs 113 
between vertical-flow and floating treatment wetlan d mesocosms was concurrently studied for a 114 
better understanding of microbial community composi tion of these two treatment wetland 115 
systems. 116

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 118 
2.1 Vertical-flow treatment wetland construction 119 
In May 2016, the experimental units were constructe d at the Everglades Wetland 120 
Research Park of Florida Gulf Coast University (26° 06.452´N, 81°46.334´W) in two rows of 121 
four wetland mesocosms (1.33 m x 0.47 m x 0.61 m  polyethylene tubs) with one row modeling 122 
vertical-flow treatment wetlands (VFTW) and one row  modeling floating treatment wetlands 123 
(FTW) in a batch system ( Fig. 1 ). Vertical-flow constructed mesocosms were filled with a 10 cm 124 
layer of gravel followed by an approximate 30 cm of  sand fill according to methods outlined in 125 
Ahn et al. (2001) and Ahn and Mitsch (2002) ( Fig. 1 ). Cordgrass ( Spartina patens ) was collected 126 
from a nearby 23-ha restored brackish marsh (5 ppt)  at the Naples Botanical Garden 127 (26°06.181´N, 81°46.534´W) (Zhang et al., 2017a) an d planted in August 2016. Salinity was 128 
gradually increased from 0 to 5 ppt to acclimate pl ants for 10 months prior to starting the 129 
experiment. Two mesocosms were incorporated with a 1 cm layer of polycaprolactone beads (3.5 130 
mm in diameter, IC3D, TechTack Moldable plastic) bu ried at a depth of 9 cm (1.82 kg) within 131 
the upper substrate layer prior to effluent feeding  to mesocosms to allow for settling of the 132 
plastics, which are buoyant in water, as upper subs trate layer was no longer densely packed after 133 
burial. Two other mesocosms were used as a control without biodegradable plastic incorporation. 134 
A nutrient removal experiment was conducted during June 2017.  135 
2.2  Floating treatment wetland construction 136 
Four floating mat treatment mesocosms were filled w ith lake water pumped up from an 137 
adjacent lake. Each mat had 18 plantings (9 cm diam eter) spaced 25 cm apart from the center of 138 
each hole ( Fig. 1 ). Seven-cm cordgrass ( S. patens ) plants were placed in aerator pots seated 139 
within the floating mats. Artificial saltwater (Ins tant Ocean) was used to adjust salinity to be 5 140 
ppt. A recirculating bioreactor system was equipped  in all four floating treatment wetlands: two 141 
mesocosms had bioreactors with polycaprolactone (PC L) plastic beads as a reactor medium with 142 
two mesocosms having empty bioreactors used as cont rol. The recirculating bioreactor setup 143 
consisted of 250 mL biodegradable beads (472 g) in AQUAMAXX bioreactors (1 L volume) 144 
connected with a filter pump (Cobalt MJ-1200) and a  flow nozzle controlled to a flowrate at 1 L 145 
min -1.  146 
2.3 Upstream tank setup 147 
A 560-liter upstream tank (dimensions 1.00 x 0.8 x 0.7 m 3) housed 10 Pinfish ( Lagodon 148 
rhomboides ) used to generate the brackish aquaculture wastewa ter ( Fig. 2 ). A filtration system 149 consisted of a canister filter with ultraviolet ste rilizer lamp (55.9 cm h x 35.6 cm d, Red Sea 150 
brand) and a 3.8 L bioreactor (NextReef, MR1 XL) wi th polypropylene plastic fill (2.54 cm Bio 151 
Barrels, Pentair) and filtration pump (Maxi-jet Pro  Powerhead, Pentair). The brackish 152 
aquaculture wastewater was fed manually once a week  for one month prior to starting the 153 
experiment and then every six days after start for two months to both systems. Average inflow 154 
parameters such as temperature, salinity, DO, and n utrient concentration are shown in Table 1 .  155 
2.4  Water sampling and chemical analysis  156 
Water samples were collected in 250 mL autoclaved p olypropylene sampling bottles 157 
(ThermoScientific Nalgene) from the outflow pipe of  mesocosms ( Fig. 1 ) and stored at -20°C 158 
until analysis. The hydraulic loading rate of the v ertical-flow systems were set to be 3.03 L day -1 159 
(48.4 cm day -1), manually fed to the system from the upstream tan k, which allowed for a 160 
complete flow-through of three days to the outflow pipe. The hydraulic loading rate (HLR) was 161 
determined according to Mitsch and Gosselink (2015)  using the following equation, q = 100Q / 162 
A, where q = (HLR), (cm day -1), Q = inflow rate, m 3 day -1, and A = wetland surface area, (m 2). 163 
Water quality parameters such as water temperature,  pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) 164 
were measured in the FTW mesocosms using a YSI Pro Plus meter. Turbidity was determined 165 
using a Trilogy fluorometer with a turbidity module  (Turner Design). Ammonia concentration 166 
was colorimetrically conducted using a Spectronic G enesys 20 spectrophotometer (Thermo 167 
Scientific) using a standard sodium salicylate meth od. Nutrients in water samples were 168 
colorimetrically determined using a SmartChem Autoa nalyzer to measure nitrate-nitrite nitrogen 169 
and Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) according to EPA guidelines 353.1 and 351.2 respectively 170 
(USEPA, 1993b, a). Total nitrogen was determined fr om the combined TKN and nitrate-nitrite 171 concentrations. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration  was determined according to the EPA 172 
guideline 365.1 (USEPA, 1993c). 173 
2.5  Plant tissue samples 174 
Aboveground plant tissue samples (9 cm 2) were randomly collected from all mesocosms 175 
at the start and end of the experiment. Changes in plant stem height were measured for an 176 
estimate of daily growth rate over each system peri od.  177 
2.6 Microscopy  178 
Water samples were collected from the outflow pipes  of each mesocosm and fixed with 179 
formalin (2% final concentration [vol/vol]). Cells were stained with 4’, 6-diamidino-2- 180 
phenylindole (DAPI), then part of the fixed water s amples (0.8 mL) were filtered onto black 181 
0.22-µm polycarbonate isopore membrane filters (GTB P, MilliporeSigma) with a standard hand 182 
vacuum pump operation. An anti-bleaching agent was used as the mounting medium (AF1; 183 
Citifluor). Cells were observed under 600x magnific ation using an Olympus BX51 184 
epifluorescence microscope system.  For each filter , more than 10 random fields were viewed to 185 
determine cell numbers. 186 
2.7  Sample collection for microbial analysis 187 
Biodegradable plastics were collected in clean 50 m L plastic centrifuge tubes from those 188 
embedded in the VFTW mesocosms and bioreactors on t he FTW mesocosms. Root samples were 189 
collected using sterilized scissors and stored in 5 0 mL centrifuge tubes, consisting of a mixture 190 
of 0 - 15 cm depth segments from two distinct locat ions within each mesocosm. Soil samples 191 
were collected from two distinct locations in each vertical-flow mesocosm at a depth of 5 cm. 192 
The collected soil samples were vortexed for homoge nization after initial collection. Water 193 samples (250 mL) collected from all FTW mesocosms w ere filtered using 0.2 µm cellulose 194 
nitrate membrane filters (47 mm diameter, Fischer S cientific Nalgene Analytical Test Filter) for 195 
further DNA extraction. All samples were stored at -20°C for DNA extraction.  196 
2.8 High throughput sequencing  197 
DNA samples were extracted from biofilm on PCL bead s, root, soil, and water filter 198 
using the MagAttract PowerSoil DNA KF kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s 199 
instructions. Extracted DNA was eluted into 100 µL EB solution. Archaeal and bacterial 16S 200 
rRNA genes were amplified using the primer set, 515 yF (5’GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) 201 
and 926pfR (5’CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) (Parada et al.,  2016) tagged with the Illumina 202 
i5 forward (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG) and i7 reverse 203 
(GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG) sequencing pri mer. Each PCR 204 
reaction contained 25 µL reactions with Qiagen HotS tar Taq master mix, equal amount of 205 
forward and reverse primers (5 µM each), and 1 µL o f DNA template (1 to 20 ng). Thermal 206 
cycling consisted of an initial denaturation at 95° C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 207 
30 sec, annealing at 54°C for 40 sec, and extension  at 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension of 208 
10 min at 72°C. PCR product from the first stage wa s then transferred to a second PCR based on 209 
qualitatively determined concentrations with primer s for the second PCR based on the Illumina 210 
Nextera PCR primers forward (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGA TCTACAC-[i5 index]- 211 
TCGTCGGCAGCGTC) and reverse (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAG AT-[i7 index]- 212 
GTCTCGTGGGCTCGG). The second stage amplification wa s run with the same as the first 213 
except for 10 cycles instead of 35 cycles. Amplicon s were visualized with eGels (Life 214 
Technologies), products were pooled equimolar with each size selected quantified using the 215 Quibit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies). Amplico ns were then loaded on an Illumina MiSeq 216 
(Illumina) 2 x 300 flow cell at 10 pM (RTL Genomics ). 217 
For analysis, FASTQ formatted files were merged usi ng the PEAR Illumina paired-end 218 
read merger (Zhang et al., 2013a). Prefix dereplica tion was completed using the algorithm of 219 
USEARCH (Edgar et al., 2011). Clustering at a 3% di vergence level was conducted using the 220 
USEARCH (Edgar et al., 2011). Operational taxonomic  unit (OTU) selection was performed 221 
using UPARSE-OTU algorithm (Edgar, 2013). Chimera c hecking was completed using 222 
UCHIME (Edgar, 2010) and detected chimera sequences  were removed. Representative OTUs 223 
were used to determine taxonomic information throug h a basic local alignment search tool 224 
(BLAST) at National Center for Biotechnology Inform ation (NCBI), and MG-RAST (Meyer et 225 
al., 2008). The high-throughput sequence datasets w ere deposited in GenBank under BioProject 226 
number PRJNA496041. 227 
2.9  Data analysis 228 
The significant differences were determined when p < 0.05. Tukey-Kramer method was 229 
employed in conjunction with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using JMP data analysis 230 
software (SAS Institute) according to Lehman (2005)  for testing statistical differences among 231 
multiple mesocosm settings. Student’s t-test was al so implemented to determine if two sets of 232 
data were significantly different from each other. All statistics (one-way ANOVA, Tukey- 233 
Kramer, and Student’s t-test) were completed using two-tailed and unpaired data analyses. Data 234 
were presented by mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise noted. General statistics of high- 235 
throughput sequence data were performed using MG-RA ST (Meyer et al., 2008). Diversity index 236 
calculations (Shannon index, Menhinick’s richness a nd Pielou’s evenness indices) were 237 
implemented using Microsoft Excel.  238  239 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  240 
3.1 Physical parameters  241 
 Average rainfall over the experimental period was 7.6 ± 0.9  mm day -1 measured using 242 
the real-time hydrologic, water quality monitoring,  and meteorological field station at the 243 
Everglades Wetland Research Park (Zhang et al., 201 7a), which was less than the calculated 244 
HLR 48.4 cm day -1, with an average rain gauge depth of 1.2 ± 1.3 cm.  Physical parameters were 245 
measured for FTW mesocosms with an average water te mperature of 29.9°C, salinity of 5.1 ppt, 246 
pH of 7.95, and DO of 3.2 mg L -1. Turbidity (NTU, nephelometric turbidity unit) was  high in the 247 
VFTW mesocosms (23.5 ± 3.0 NTU and 47.0 ± 7.3 NTU w ith and without biodegradable plastic, 248 
respectively) and low in the FTW mesocosms (1.71 ± 0.1 NTU and 2.26 ± 0.2 NTU) due to the 249 
impact of soil. 250 
3.2 Effect of biodegradable plastics for nutrient r emoval  251 
Total nitrogen retention was significantly differen t (p ˂ 0.001, n = 8, one-way ANOVA) 252 
and higher in the vertical-flow system ( Table 2). TN retention performance in our vertical-flow 253 
system (86.9-90%) was consistent with other saline aquaculture effluent treatment wetland 254 
systems with a mean removal efficiency of 98% TN (B rown et al., 1999), and 98.2% TDIN 255 
(Webb et al., 2012) ( Table 3). On the contrary, TN retention was not observed i n FTW 256 
mesocosms over the experimental period as outflow c oncentrations exceeded the inflow 257 
concentration of effluent ( Table 2) , leading to a negative retention rate, consistent with a 258 
previous aquaculture wastewater treatment study sho wing outflow concentration of TKN 259 
exceeded feed water TKN (Lin et al., 2010). However , the presence of PCL significantly 260 increased the TN retention, even though a negative retention occurred in this system, a greater 261 
negative TN retention was observed without the use of PCL beads in our control condition (p ˂ 262 
0.0001, Tukey-Kramer pairwise). This finding was no t identified in the VFTW system ( Table 2). 263 
A comparison study in China found that floating tre atment systems had a lower TN removal 264 
efficiency compared with vertical-flow systems (Zha ng et al., 2015). Newly constructed or 265 
newly restored wetlands are found to have a low C:N  ratio, therefore the addition of an external 266 
carbon can enhance denitrification in these wetland  systems (Bachand and Horne, 1999), as 267 
evidenced in the FTW system in our study. Overall, these lines of evidence indicate the strict 268 
carbon limitation in the FTW than the other treatme nt wetland systems (Zhang et al., 2015). 269 
Inflow TN was composed of over 98% inorganic nitrog en, mainly in the form of nitrate 270 
and nitrite ( Table 1 ). In the VFTW system nitrate plus nitrite ratio de creased to be 17.6% in the 271 
control and 16.2% with embedded PCL, along with a d ecrease of the TN:TP ratio from 8.9 to 4.7 272 
and 4.5 respectively, indicating microbial nitrogen  removal processes (i.e. denitrification or 273 
DNRA [dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium])  ( Fig. 3a ). Our ammonia measurements 274 
showed the depletion of ammonia from 9.2% in inflow  to 7.1% in the control and 5.7% with 275 
embedded PCL, with an increase in organic nitrogen to 75.3% and 78.2%, respectively. Based on 276 
these findings we concluded that denitrification, n ot DNRA, was the major process in the 277 
removal of nitrate plus nitrite pool in the VFTW. I n the FTW system nitrate plus nitrite ratio 278 
decreased from 94.2% to be 40.5% in the FTW control  and 10.7% in FTW with PCL condition, 279 
with an increased removal efficiency with presence of PCL ( Fig. 3a ). Additionally, we found a 280 
decrease of ammonia in outflow water from 5.8% to 3 .2% in control and 4.3% with PCL 281 
conditions. Organic nitrogen increased to 56.3% in control and 85.0% in FTW mesocosms with 282 
embedded PCL, a greater proportion of organic nitro gen with presence of PCL. Aquaculture 283 effluent contains low organic nitrogen and phosphor us in the water column with 7-32% of 284 
nitrogen found in suspended solids (Turcios and Pap enbrock, 2014). As previously discussed, 285 
TN retention was not observed in FTW mesocosms due to the production of organic nitrogen 286 
from the system not present in inflow waters leadin g to the negative retention of TN as 287 
production of nitrogen occurred. However, there was  a decrease in inorganic nitrogen 288 
concentrations with greater decreases observed with  the presence of PCL, suggesting the use of 289 
PCL as a carbon source for denitrification ( Fig. 3a ). In contrast with the VFTW system, the 290 
TN:TP ratio in outflow water increased from 13.2 to  27 in control and 17 with PCL medium 291 
supporting our finding of greater nitrogen concentr ation found without presence of PCL in the 292 
FTW system ( Fig. 3b ). The accumulation of organic nitrogen within the FTW system was 293 
attributed to the release of organic nitrogen from plant pot soil within the floating mats which 294 
was supported by the anomaly of water column microb ial community dominated by soil bacteria, 295 
which will be discussed further in later sections. The production of organic nitrogen in wetlands 296 
can also partially be attributed to nitrogen-fixing  bacteria which fix N 2 from the atmosphere 297 
leading to production of organic nitrogen reducing the overall nitrogen removal efficiency 298 
(Mitsch and Gosselink, 2015; Zhang et al., 2017b). 299 
 TP retention was significantly higher in the VFTW system than for the FTW system (p ˂ 300 
0.0032, t-test), however, no significance was found with the  presence of PCL in both mesocosm 301 
systems ( Table 2). The TP retention in the VFTW mesocosms had a mea n retention of 74 - 302 
81.1%, which was lower than similar studies, 99% (B rown et al., 1999) and 88% (Lymbery et 303 
al., 2006) ( Table 3). Zhang et al. (2015) found TP removal efficiency ranged from 26-70% and 304 
was more variable than nitrogen in constructed wetl and systems. The mean TP retention in the 305 FTW system was 17.4-39.5%, consistent with findings  by Lin et al. (2010) with 2-18% removal 306 
and Pavlineri et al. (2017) of 18.2% removal effici ency, with an increase over time ( Table 3).  307 
3.3 Growth of Spartina in vertical-flow and floatin g treatment systems  308 
Change in plant height ranged from 1.7 to 17.3 mm d ay -1 with the highest growth rate 309 
occurring in the FTW mesocosms with PCL medium ( Fig. 4 ). Even though there seemed to be an 310 
increased growth rate associated with use of PCL me dium in the FTW system, the range of 311 
measurements overlapped when looking at mean growth  rate. Due to a low number of replicates 312 
in this study ( n = 2), no statistical comparison was made. 313 
3.4 Bacterial abundance  314 
 Total bacterial abundance of wetland water columns  generally range from 10 5 to 10 6 cells 315 
mL -1 (Urakawa and Bernhard, 2017), which was similar wi th our findings. No significant 316 
differences were found in the outflow bacterial abu ndance with the following distribution; 317 
VFTW control (3.7 x 10 6 ± 1.8 x 10 6 cells mL -1), VFTW with embedded PCL (3.5 x 10 6 ± 1.7 x 318 
10 6 cells mL -1), FTW control (1.0 x 10 6 ± 6.3 x 10 5 cells mL -1), and FTW with PCL medium (3.2 319 
x 10 6 ± 2.2 x 10 6 cells mL -1).  320 
3.5 High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene  321 
3.5.1 Taxonomic overview of dominant phyla  322 
A total of 86,547 sequences were analyzed and resul ted in 2346 operational taxonomic 323 
units (OTUs) ( Table 4). Shannon index indicated significant differences between sample means 324 
(p = 0.02, one-way ANOVA) with the lowest diversity  in water samples and the highest diversity 325 
in root samples. There were significant differences  found between VFTW root and FTW water 326 
samples (p = 0.03, Tukey-pairwise). The highest div ersity found in soil samples was consistent 327 with previous reports (Urakawa and Bernhard, 2017).  The taxonomic analysis identified 29 phyla 328 
from all samples: 12-21 collected from PCL plastic biofilm, 15-24 in root samples, 17-20 in soil 329 
samples, and 8-11 in water samples. No statistical difference was found in PCL biofilm samples 330 
(p = 0.06, t-test) and soil samples (p = 0.5, t-test). Root samples were significantly different ( p = 331 
0.03, n = 2, one-way ANOVA) between VFTW control and FTW w ith PCL (p = 0.03, Tukey- 332 
pairwise). Water samples in floating treatment syst em conditions having PCL bioreactor medium 333 
were significantly lower than the control samples ( p = 0.0002, t-test).  334 
The three predominant phylum present in all samples  were Proteobacteria (2-44%),  335 
Cyanobacteria  (0.04-51%) and Bacteroidetes  (0.02-30%) ( Fig. 5 ). These results were consistent 336 
with previous studies of wetland microbial communit ies (Bai et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016; 337 
Urakawa and Bernhard, 2017). Members of Proteobacteria  are important in wetlands because of 338 
their strong involvement in biogeochemical cycling (Liu et al., 2016) and they dominated in a 339 
majority of samples except for water column samples  from FTW. The two most abundant phyla 340 
in the water column samples were Firmicutes  (59-90%) and Actinobacteria (6-17%) ( Fig. 5 ). 341 
Unexpectedly, the most dominant member of Firmicutes was  identified as  Bacillus  (57-88%), 342 
this trend agreed between four samples assuring goo d reproducibility of the method used. We 343 
attributed this finding to the presence of soil wit hin plant pots ( Fig. 2 ). Bacillus is recognized as 344 
a representative degrader of biodegradable plastics . For example, Bacillus  pumilus , isolated from 345 
a freshwater pond and river were shown to degrade p oly (e-caprolactone) hydrolytically (Tezuka 346 
et al., 2004). However, presence of Bacillus was found regardless of PCL medium indicating that 347 
Bacillus was not directly enriched by the biodegradable plas tics ( Table 5). 348 
Soil microbial communities in VFTW were dominated b y Proteobacteria (40-85%), 349 
Cyanobacteria (5-40%),  Bacteroidetes (2-10%), and  Planctomycetes (2-7%) ( Fig. 5 ). The soil 350 was covered with approximately 5-10 cm of water lay er ( Fig. 2 ). Cyanobacteria is a typical 351 
phylum found in freshwater sediment and water colum n communities (Paerl, 2014; Urakawa and 352 
Bernhard, 2017; Paerl, 2018). Thus, the observed mi crobial community might resemble a typical 353 
freshwater sediment community rather than a typical  soil community (Zhang et al., 2013b). A 354 
steep oxic-anoxic gradient contributes to maintain high microbial diversity and functionally 355 
diverse organisms (Urakawa et al., 2017). Our resul ts supported this finding by having the 356 
highest diversity found in soil samples of our wetl and.  357 
3.5.2 Comparison of rhizosphere communities in soil  and water 358 
In wetland plants, the rhizosphere acts as an inter face between the surface of roots and 359 
the surrounding soil, which transports oxygen and o ther minerals to the roots which results in 360 
unique microbial communities distinct from surround ing soil and water column in a case of 361 
floating macrophytes (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2015; U rakawa et al., 2017).   362 
The nitrogen cycle plays an important role in wetla nd plant metabolisms through the 363 
transformation of nitrogen species (i.e. ammonia an d nitrate).  Mesorhizobium  and Rhizobium  are 364 
essential diazotrophs and plant growth-promoting rh izosphere bacteria found in wetland systems 365 
(Zhang et al., 2013b; Urakawa et al., 2017). Mesorhizobium  was identified in root, soil, water, 366 
and PCL biofilm samples while Rhizobium  was identified only in vertical-flow root samples 367 
(Table 5). Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were more abundant in t he VFTW than FTW mesocosms. 368 
The only nitrifying bacterium identified was Nitrospira , in root, soil, and VFTW PCL biofilm 369 
samples. 370 
Methanogenesis is an important process in wetlands through which methane is naturally 371 
produced by methanogens and methane oxidation occur s from methanotrophic bacteria to 372 convert methane to carbon dioxide (Mitsch and Gosse link, 2015). Archaea are important 373 
methanogens in wetland sediments contributing to me thane production (Madigan et al., 2012; 374 
Urakawa and Bernhard, 2017), three genera of methan ogenic archaea found were 375 
Methanobacterium , Methanoregula , and Methanosarcina . Six methanotrophic genera were also 376 
found, Methylocystis , Methylobacter , Methylococcus , Methylosoma, Methylocella and  377 
Hyphomicrobium . These methanogens and methanotrophs were more abu ndant  in the VFTW 378 
than in the FTW mesocosms ( Table 5). Hyphomicrobium  belonging to Alphaproteobacteria  and 379 
Methylibium  belonging to Betaproteobacteria  were the two most abundant facultative 380 
methylotrophic genera and widely distributed in our  constructed wetland systems, which 381 
supported a previous wetland study (Zhang et al., 2 013b). Methylocella  was the most widespread 382 
methanotroph found in this study. Coexistence of me thanogens and methane oxidizers suggests 383 
the existence of the methane cycle and the skewed r elative abundance of these microorganisms 384 
indicated more imperative role of this process in t he vertical-flow system than in the floating 385 
wetland system. 386 
Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were the predominan t sulfur cycling microorganisms 387 
found in root samples and PCL biofilm. Although SRB  were found in both systems, the vertical- 388 
flow system contained a greater diversity of organi sms (i.e.  Desulfobulbus , Desulfatitalea , 389 
Desulfobacterium , Desulfonema , Desulfocapsa , Desulfopila , Desulfomicrobium , and 390 
Desulfovibrio ) than were found in the floating treatment system (i.e.  Desulfovibrio and 391 
Desulfobulbus ) ( Table 5). The floating treatment system contained very min or amount of SRB in 392 
contrast to Urakawa et al (2017) which found a very  rich SRB community in floating treatment 393 
rhizosphere. SRB communities in rhizosphere and soi l in a Phragmites australis planted wetland 394 (Zhang et al., 2013b) and wetland soils (Faulwetter  et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012) were very 395 
diverse and consistent with our findings.  396 
3.5.3 Denitrification in vertical-flow and floating  treatment systems 397 
Denitrification is the main nitrogen removal proces s in treatment wetland systems as 398 
discussed previously and paired with nitrification,  a process in which nitrate is produced from 399 
ammonium, can fully remove nitrogen microbially fro m wastewater systems (Faulwetter et al., 400 
2009). Predominant denitrifiers found in our study were Bacillus in water column samples, 401 
Nitratireductor , a marine denitrifier (Labbè et al., 2004) represe nted in all samples in minor 402 
amount, and Pseudomonas (0.2%) in soil samples with embedded biodegradable plastics ( Table 403 
5). Pseudomonas  has been found to degrade plastic particles in an urban river environment 404 
(McCormick et al., 2014), soil environments (Emadia n et al., 2017), and the deep-sea (Sekiguchi 405 
et al., 2011). The presence of Pseudomonas only in soil samples with PCL may indicate the 406 
possibility of PCL use as a substratum or degradabi lity, as indicated by similar findings of 407 
Pseudomonas on plastic pot biofilm from a floating treatment we tland (Urakawa et al., 2017). 408 
These findings support our observation of increased  denitrification activity in the VFTW and 409 
FTW construction with the presence of PCL.  410 
3.5.4 PCL degradation in a vertical-flow and floati ng treatment constructed wetland  411 
The most abundant genera found in PCL biofilm sampl es collected from VFTW sediment 412 
were identified as Oscillatoria  (7%) and Leptolyngbya  (6%) and from FTW bioreactors were 413 
Brasilonema  (8%) and Trichormus  (9%) belonging to the phylum Cyanobacteria (Table 5). 414 
Additionally, Leptolyngbya  was identified in VFTW sediment with embedded PCL.  The 415 
localization of Cyanobacteria in VFTW plastics was attributed to a partial exposu re of plastics to 416 the surface ( Fig. 2 ). We identified many Cyanobacteria within our study in presence of PCL 417 
plastic, consistent with previous marine plastic de bris research (Bryant et al., 2016; Debroas et 418 
al., 2017; Quero and Luna, 2017). Cyanobacteria  were identified as the key species in the 419 
microbial network which is formed on the surface of  plastics (Debroas et al., 2017). However, 420 
none of these studies confirmed if Cyanobacteria  are actively involved in the biodegradation of 421 
the plastics (Debroas et al., 2017; Quero and Luna,  2017). Bryant et al. (2016) and Debroas et al. 422 
(2017) identified Leptolyngbya on the surface of plastics collected from the surfa ce water of the 423 
North Atlantic. It should be noted that Cyanobacteria  are able to synthesize 424 
polyhydroxybutryate, an intracellular storage compo und and bioplastic, under photoautotrophic 425 
or chemoheterotrophic conditions (Balaji et al., 20 13; Singh et al., 2017). Additionally, several 426 
genera can synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) an d contain PHA biosynthesis genes (e.g. 427 
Oscillatoria limosa , Anabaena cylindrica , Synechoccocus  spp.), these findings can lead to the 428 
speculation they are also able to degrade these bio plastic storage compounds for intracellular use. 429 
3.6 Economic impact of plastic-embedded constructed  wetlands 430 
As previously discussed, constructed wetlands are b eneficial in terms of nutrient 431 
retention. Our approach will potentially enhance th e performance of nutrient retention processes 432 
and increase the value of constructed wetlands. We used 1 kg m -2 of PCL within the VFTW 433 
system. If we assume to construct a 1 ha vertical-f low wetland embedded with PCL 434 
biodegradable plastics, it would cost approximately  $56,500 only considering the price of 435 
plastics. Boley et al. (2000) estimated the consump tion of plastic substrate per kg N-NO 3- and 436 
cost of denitrification per kg N-NO 3- in a study of an aquaculture bioreactor system wit h an 437 
approximate 0.64 kg of N-NO 3- removal by PCL per kg. A study by Batson et al. (2 012) 438 
estimated the nitrogen removal from a constructed r iparian wetland as 0.0164 kg m -2 yr -1.  439 Therefore, if we assume all embedded PCL is used fo r denitrification, the constructed wetland 440 
has atleast a 39 times performance increase than re gular constructed wetlands to remove 441 
nitrogen, suggesting a great potential for use in c ityscape and other high-priced areas. In the 442 
future, we anticipate that the use of biodegradable  plastics will increase due to the current plastic 443 
pollution problems.  A part of used biodegradable p lastics can be embedded in soil and used as a 444 
carbon source by wetland microbes. In this scenario , the cost of used biodegradable plastics can 445 
be negligible. Our study showed the potential use o f this system however, much longer-term 446 
monitoring and more expanded field experiments are required in the future applications.  447 
 448 
4. CONCLUSIONS 449 
 Wetlands play a vital role in water purification an d nutrient cycling which can be utilized 450 
to treat agricultural runoff and aquaculture discha rges in a sustainable fashion (Headley and 451 
Tanner, 2011; Mitsch and Gosselink, 2015). Comparis on of wetland construction performance in 452 
this study between a vertical-flow treatment wetlan d and a floating treatment wetland showed 453 
there was an increased nutrient retention for both TN and TP with a vertical-flow system. The 454 
use of a biodegradable plastic, PCL, was utilized a s a novel approach in this study as an external 455 
carbon source to enhance microbial activity. PCL wa s shown to increase the TN nutrient 456 
retention in the FTW system, however, this system e xhibited a negative retention during our 457 
study period due to the release of organic nitrogen  from soil in plant pots, which was inferred 458 
from the dominance of Firmicutes  (59-90%) (e.g. Bacillus ) in the water column of FTW. 459 
Presence of PCL in the FTW system allowed for a gre ater production of organic nitrogen and a 460 
greater removal of inorganic nitrogen, suggesting P CL enhanced nitrogen cycling within this 461 
system. Microbial community composition was shown t o be altered with the presence of PCL, 462 community selection for cyanobacterial genera and o ther bioplastic-degrading microorganisms 463 
was found from high-throughput sequencing analysis.  Further long-term studies are needed at 464 
this point to have a greater understanding of micro bial plastic degradation and associated nutrient 465 
cycling in constructed wetland systems. A general c ost analysis of utilizing a biodegradable 466 
plastic for enhanced microbial activity and nutrien t removal was conducted, it was seen that the 467 
upfront cost is high, however, compared to the pote ntial N-NO 3- removal efficiency in the system 468 
this cost is negligible over time. We believe that the potential for use of a biodegradable plastic 469 
to enhance nutrient removal within a constructed we tland can be a promising approach in 470 
wetland engineering for increased nutrient cycling efficiency.   471
