Objective: This novel study explored the potential of two endolichenic fungi, Pseudopestalotiopsis theae
(PT, accession number MG881833) and Astrocystis bambusae (AB, accession number MH370741) in decol-
orizing Malachite Green (MG).Methods: Their efﬁcacy in dye decolorization was compared to non-endolichenic fungus Trichoderma
asperellum (TA, accession number KP792512). Decolorization test was performed using MG (100 ppm)
for 14 days (absorbance at 617 nm) to determine decolorization efﬁciency (DE, %). The pellet was col-lected for FTIR analysis (4000 to 700 cm
/C01, 50-scan speed) while the supernatant was analysed with
UV-spectral analysis (300–800 nm) to detect for biodegradation.
Results: P. theae demonstrated the highest decolorization efﬁciency (DE%) at 89.22%, followed by T.
asperellum (76.19%) and A. bambusae (67.69%). Common functional groups (i.e., AOH,ACOOH, ANH,
ACH, C@O,@CAH) were detected in all isolates and their roles in biosorption were evident by the shifts
in peaks and peak intensity. Biodegradation of MG was concluded based on UV-spectra peaks at 617 nm,
which were signiﬁcantly reduced (or absent).Conclusion: This study is the ﬁrst to reveal that endolichenic fungi P. theae and A. bambusae are capable of
decolorizing the toxic dye malachite green.

1. Introduction
Endolichenic fungi (ELF) are found in lichens and are ubiquitous
in the environment. They have been recovered from lichen species
across a vast geographical region; from the Arctic and Antarctic
regions to the tropics ( Arnold et al., 2009; Kannangara et al.,
2009; U’ren et al., 2010 ;Suryanarayanan et al., 2017 ). Existing
reports suggested ELF predominantly comprise of species ofAscomycota (Pezizomycotina) ( U’ren et al., 2010; Kellogg and
Raja, 2017 ), Basidiomycota and Zygomycota ( Tripathi and Joshi,
2015 ). Examples of common ELF include Aspergillus versicolor (Li
et al., 2015 ),Penicillium sp. and Chrysosporium sp. ( Kannangara
et al., 2009 ).
The ELF are similar to the endophytic fungi based on species
identiﬁed, transmission mode, phylogenetic relationship and evo-
lutionary history ( Arnold et al., 2009; Hawas et al., 2012; Waqas
et al., 2014 ). The two ELF in this study, Pseudopestalotiopsis theae
(PT) and Astrocystis bambusae (AB) ,are known endophytes
(Peláez et al., 2008; Maharachchikumbura et al., 2014; Dai et al.,
2017 ) but their nature as ELF is novel. In addition, ELF has not been
explored for bioremediation, although they are valued for their
metabolites (e.g. xanthones, alkaloids, quinones, anthraquinones,
pyrones, furanones, steroids and benzopyranoids) ( Wang et al.,
2012; Dou et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2014; Santiago and Ting, 2019 ).
This study therefore, aims to establish the potential of ELF in
removing toxic dyes, particularly triphenylmethane (TPM) dyes.
TPM dyes are cationic, N-methylated diaminotriphenylmethane
dyes, used extensively for various industries (printing, textile, food,
paper), and include the malachite green dye (MG) ( Chen et al.
2019 ). MG is toxic and carcinogenic and although biological

removal of MG has been attempted using non-endolichenic fungi
(Chen and Ting, 2015a; 2015b ), exploration using ELF remains nov-
el. The potential use of ELF for bioremediation is associated with
their lichen hosts. Kulkarni et al. (2014) used the lichen Permelia
perlata to decolorize (80.4% decolorization efﬁciency, DE) Solvent
Red 24. In another study, the lichen Dermatocarpon vellereceum
decolorized Navy Blue HE22 (87.4% DE) ( Kulkarni et al., 2018 ).
Dye degradation by these lichens was attributed to the enzymes
laccase, manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase. However,
as lichens are extremely slow-growing, ELF are sought as alterna-
tives to decolorize dyes, especially with reports that ELF are cap-
able of secreting similar enzymes as their lichen hosts
(Kannangara et al., 2009; Beckett et al., 2013 ).
This study embarks on discovering the dye degradation poten-
tial of two ELF species ( Pseudopestalotiopsis theae and Astrocystis
bambusae ), and their potential for removal of MG dye. ELF are
explored as their lichen host have shown good potential for dye
remediation. Furthermore, ELF are similar to endophytes, and
may have similar dye degrading potential as endophytes. There-
fore, in this study, the efﬁcacy of the ELF is compared against a
non-endolichenic fungus, Trichoderma asperellum, which is an
endophyte. This will be one of the ﬁrst attempts in realizing the
dye degradation activities of ELF.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Culture establishment and generation of fungal biomass
The ELF Pseudopestalotiopsis theae (PT, accession number
MG881833) and Astrocystis bambusae (AB, accession number
MH370741) were obtained as pure stock cultures. These isolateswere isolated from the lichen Usnea pectinata (Sagada Mountain
Province, Philippines) and U. bismolliuscula (Bukit Larut, Perak,
Malaysia), respectively. The non-endolichenic fungus Trichoderma
asperellum (TA, accession number KP792512) was also obtained
as stock culture, previously been isolated from Phragmites sp., a
phytoremediator plant ( Sim et al., 2016 ). The isolates were cul-
tured on potato dextrose agar (PDA, Friendemann Schmidt) and
incubated at room temperature (RT, 25 ± 2 /C176C). To generate bio-
mass, ten mycelial plugs (5 mm diameter) of each isolate were
inoculated into 250 mL potato dextrose broth (PDB, Friendemann
Schmidt) and incubated (100 rpm, RT) (Innova 44 stackable incu-
bator shaker, New Brunswick Scientiﬁc) for 5 days or until sufﬁ-
cient biomass is attained ( Chew and Ting, 2016 ). The mycelium
was then harvested via ﬁltration through sterile cheesecloth,
rinsed with sufﬁcient amount of distilled water, and weighed to
0.5 g fresh weight ( Macharchand and Ting, 2017 ). The fresh bio-
mass was used for subsequent experiments.
2.2. Dye decolorization activities
Malachite Green (MG) (CAS-No.2437–29-8, Friendemann Sch-
midt) dye was added into 25 mL autoclaved MilliQ water
(18.2 M
X, Sartorius, Malaysia) to produce the dye solution
(100 ppm concentration). The fresh fungal biomass (0.5 g) (from
section 2.1) was then inoculated into the dye solution and incu-
bated for 14 days (25 ± 2 /C176C, 120 rpm). Non-inoculated (untreated)
MG solution was assigned as negative control and incubated sim-
ilarly. For every 24 h-interval (until day 14), 2 mL of dye solution
was pipetted and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 10 min), and the absor-
bance of the supernatant read at 617 nm (Tecan Spark M10 plate
reader). The pellet was collected for FTIR analysis. The procedure
was repeated for all isolates and the decolorization efﬁciency
(DE, %) (Equation 1) was determined as follows:
Decolorization efficiency ðDE;%Þ¼ Ai/C0Ao ðÞ =Ai ½/C138 /C2 100%where A irepresented initial absorbance and A ofor observed absor-
bance upon treatment with the isolates ( Macharchand and Ting,
2017 ).
2.3. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectral analysis for detection of
biodegradation potential
Fresh fungal biomass (0.5 g) was introduced into 25 mL of MG
solution, and incubated for 14 days (100 rpm, RT). Non-treated
dye solution was assigned as negative control and incubated sim-
ilarly. Two mL of aliquot was withdrawn every 24-h interval for
the next 14 days. The suspension was centrifuged (10,000 rpm,
10 min) and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured
(300 to 800 nm) with a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UviLine
9400, Secomam). The UV–vis spectra peaks (day 1–14) for treated
and non-treated (control) MG solutions were then plotted and
compared ( Macharchand and Ting, 2017 ).
2.4. FTIR-analysis of fungal biomass in Malachite Green solution
The biomass of AB, PT and TA were collected at day 1 and 8 from
treated solutions ( Section 2.2 ). The pellet obtained was oven-dried
(50/C176C) overnight, and ground into powder form using pestle and
mortar. Single-reﬂection attenuated total reﬂection spectra (within
4000–400 cm/C01) was obtained using the FTIR spectrometer con-
ducted under ambient temperature. Data were collected within
the mid-infrared region from 4000 to 700 cm/C01(50-scan speed)
to exclude interference ( Chew and Ting, 2016 ).
2.5. Statistical analysis
Each experiment was conducted in triplicates, and the data
analysed with One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using Statis-
tical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 22.0 (IBM).
Means were compared using Tukey’s Test (Honestly Signiﬁcant
Difference, HSD (0.05)).
3. Results
3.1. Decolorization of Malachite Green dye
All three isolates decolorized MG, resulting in hues of bluish
green. The isolate P. theae (PT) was most effective with signiﬁcantly
highest DE (71.42%), compared to T. asperellum (TA) (64.16% DE)

same letter and font type are not signiﬁcantly different according to Tukey’s Test(HSD

2and A. bambusae (AB) (55.39% DE) ( Fig. 1 ). A difference of 7.26% in
DE was observed for PT and TA. Decolorization of MG by PT was
also more effective compared to AB, resulting in a difference of
16.03% in DE.
The dye decolorization rate was, however, more rapidly
observed when TA was used for dye treatment. The DE wasincreasing signiﬁcantly for the ﬁrst 4 days, with maximum DE
attained by day 4 (66.77%). On the contrary, dye decolorization
by both ELF (PT, AB) were less rapid than TA. Decolorization activ-
ities peaked at day 5 for both isolates (79.27% and 55.14%, for PT
and AB, respectively) ( Fig. 2 ). By day 14, PT demonstrated the high-
est DE with 89.22% DE, compared to TA (76.19% DE) and AB (67.69%
DE) ( Fig. 2 ).
3.2. UV–vis spectra
By day 1, the spectra peak for MG (at 617 nm) treated with TA
(absorbance = 2.008) had the lowest absorbance compared to AB
(absorbance = 2.099) and PT (absorbance = 2.381). Spectrum for
negative control (untreated MG) remained the highest
(absorbance = 2.568) ( Fig. 3 ). By day 14, the untreated MG solution
retained the absorbance peak at 617 nm (absorbance = 2.499), but
treatment with PT (absorbance = 0.271), TA (absorbance = 0.581)
and AB (absorbance = 0.753) showed diminished peaks ( Fig. 3 ).
The UV–vis spectra suggested possible degradation of MG as the
dye chromophore was no longer detected. PT was concluded to
have the most potential for biodegradation of MG dye ( Fig. 3 ).
3.3. FTIR spectra
The FTIR spectra for TA, PT and AB revealed the presence of
additional functional groups (1000–2000 cm/C01) detected post-
treatment in MG ( Figs. 4–6 ). The major functional groups detected
were hydroxyl ( AOH), carboxyl ( ACOOH), amine ( ANH) and alkane

(HSD 0.05). Comparisons are made across time (days) within the same isolate. Error

For each of thepeaks, the following primary functional groups are detected; (a) hydroxyl, (b)amine and (c) alkanes.Adeline Su Yien Ting, Chloe Kai Wai Cheng and Krystle Angelique Aguda Santiago Journal of King Saud University – Science 33 (2021) 101579
3(ACH). Other functional groups observed include the stretching of
C@O in esters (peaks at 1745.26 cm/C01) and@CAH bending in aro-
matic rings (peaks at 815.49 cm/C01)(Supplementary File-Table S1-
S6). The FTIR spectra also revealed that AB in natural form (pre-
treatment with MG), have lesser functional groups ( ~4 major
groups) ( Fig. 4 ) compared to TA ( ~6 major groups) ( Fig. 5 ) and PT
(~6 major groups) ( Fig. 6 ). The number of major functional groups
for AB remained the lowest of the three isolates, even post-
treatment, with only ~5 major groups detected compared to ~8
major groups for both TA and PT ( Figs. 4–6 ).
For AB, the bands representing the stretching of C @O in esters
and@CAH bending in aromatic rings were absent ( Fig. 4 ). Binding
of MG to AB is ascribed to AOH and ANH (shifts from
3280.31 cm/C01to 3281.49 cm/C01), asymmetric CH 2Aand CH 3A
stretching vibrations (shifts from 2924.28 cm/C01to 2923.06 cm/C01)
and CH 3deformations (shifts from 1373.16 cm/C01to
1362.90 cm/C01)(Fig. 4 ). Bands at 1633.82 cm/C01(C@N and C @O
stretching within the aromatic ring) shifted to 1634.77 cm/C01.A
new peak observed at 1518.79 cm/C01(CAH bending in aromatic
ring), suggested the possible binding of the MG dye to AB ( Fig. 4 ).
The FTIR spectra for both PT and TA were similar. For PT, bind-
ing of MG was detected by shifts in peaks from 3278.01 cm/C01to
3275.21 cm/C01(hydroxyl ( AOH) and amine ( ANH)), from
2922.95 cm/C01to 2923.28 cm/C01, 2853.24 cm/C01to 2858.02 cm/C01
(symmetric and asymmetric CH 2Aand CH 3Astretching vibration),
from 1374.26 cm/C01to 1372.96 cm/C01(CH 3deformations) and emer-
gence of peaks at 1518.20 cm/C01(CAH bending in aromatic ring)
and 813.66 cm/C01(@CAH bending in aromatic ring) ( Fig. 6 ). ForTA, exposure to MG resulted in shifts for the hydroxyl ( AOH) and
amine ( ANH) groups (from 3269.18 cm/C01to 3272.13 cm/C01) and
for symmetric and asymmetric CH 2Aand CH 3Astretching vibra-
tions and CH 3deformations from 2923.23 cm/C01, 2853.54 cm/C01
and 1375.91 cm/C01to 2923.02 cm/C01, 2854.01 cm/C01and
1374.49 cm/C01, respectively ( Fig. 5 ). New peaks were detected at
814.81 cm/C01(CAH bending in aromatic ring) after 14 days of treat-
ment in MG.
To summarize, the FTIR spectra revealed that PT and AB shared
similar major functional groups as the non-endolichenic TA. The
number of functional groups may have a predisposition on the
dye decolourization activities, as AB, which has the lowest number
of functional groups, demonstrated lower dye decolourization efﬁ-
ciency and vice versa . Another critical observation is that new
peaks were detected in all isolates post-treatment of MG, i.e.
@CAH bending in aromatic ring (814.81 cm/C01or 813.66 cm/C01)
for TA and PT, and C @C stretching vibration in the benzene ring
(1518.20 cm/C01or 1518.19 cm/C01) for PT and AB. Isolate PT, with
the highest decolourization activities, was discovered to have both
these new peaks.
4. Discussion
This study has discovered that ELF have the potential to
decolorize MG dye. P. theae (PT) is phylogenetically related to
Pestalotiopsis, which has been reported to decolourize raw textile
efﬂuents of reactive dyes ( ~79.30 ± 1.70 % DE) ( Verma et al.
Fig. 5. FTIR spectra analysis of T. asperellum (TA) (A) at day 1 and (B) day 14 after
inoculation for the treatment of Malachite Green (MG solutions). For each of thepeaks, the following primary functional groups are detected; (a) hydroxyl, (b)
amine, (c) alkanes and (d) other groups.

For each of thepeaks, the following primary functional groups are detected; (a) hydroxyl, (b)amine, (c) alkanes and (d) other groups.Adeline Su Yien Ting, Chloe Kai Wai Cheng and Krystle Angelique Aguda Santiago Journal of King Saud University – Science 33 (2021) 101579
42010 ). Interestingly, decolorization of MG by A. bambusae (AB) is
reported for the ﬁrst time. Although these ELF were isolated from
pristine environments, they showed potential for dye removal,
supporting their similarity to their lichen hosts and endophytes
in removing dyes.
The dye decolorization efﬁciencies are presumably associated to
the type and number of functional groups present. With lower
number and types of functional groups found, poorer decoloriza-
tion activities were observed. Hydroxyl ( AOH), amine ( ANH),
alkane groups of symmetric and asymmetric CH2 Aand CH3 A
stretching vibration, CH3 deformations, C @N, C@O groups and
C@C ring in lignin, or C @O in esters; are all responsible to bind
cationic dyes (i.e. MG) via biosorption. Binding with dye molecules
changes/shifts peaks of hydrogen bonds of functional groups
(Zhang et al., 2011; Al Prol et al., 2017 ), while emergence of new
peaks may arise from organic acids produced by fungi ( Oberle-
Kilic et al., 2013 ). The UV–vis spectra resonated with the FTIR
results, suggesting ELF decolorized MG effectively. On the contrary,
isolate A. bambusae (AB) which has lesser functional groups com-
pared to T. asperellum (TA) and P. theae (PT) (absence of C @N and
C@O stretching of carboxyl groups and C @C ring in lignin), demon-
strated inferior decolorization activities.
From these observations, ELF is concluded to decolorize MG via
biosorption and biodegradation as their main mechanisms.
Biosorption occurs immediately as dye molecules bind to the func-
tional groups present on the surface of fungal mycelium, reﬂected
by the rapid decolorization rate, which plateaus once the binding
sites are saturated and equilibrium is achieved ( Khalaf, 2008;
Rybczyn ´ska-Tkaczyk and Korniłłowicz-Kowalska, 2016;
Macharchand and Ting, 2017 ). Biodegradation involves enzymatic
breakdown of the dyes evident by diminishing spectra peaks
(Kaushik and Malik, 2009 ). Although enzymatic analyses were
not performed, the differences in spectra peaks from the UV–vis
analysis concurs that biodegradation through enzymatic processes
likely occurred ( Chen and Ting, 2015a, 2015b; Macharchand and
Ting, 2017 ). Furthermore, Pestalotiopsis and Trichoderma have been
proﬁled to produce enzymes related to biodegradation such as lac-
case, lignin-peroxidase or NADH-DCIP reductase ( Verma et al.,
2010; Shedbalkar and Jadhav, 2011; Macharchand and Ting,
2017 ). This study can beneﬁt from further optimization studies
to determine the optimum operational parameters for successful
decolorization of MG. The toxicity of treated MG and the by-
products produced can also be further examined. Although these
are not investigated at this stage, previous studies using fungi have
shown that optimum parameters are isolate dependent and treated
dyes are often less toxic than original dye solutions observed from
phytotoxicity tests ( Chen and Ting, 2015a, 2015b; Chen et al.,
2019 ).
5. Conclusion
This study revealed the dye decolorization potential of ELF ( P.
theae and A. bambusae ).P. theae has better decolorization efﬁciency
compared to the non-endolichenic T. asperellum , while A. bambusae
was the least effective. The decolorization activities were attribu-
ted to both biosorption and biodegradation activities. Findings
here highlighted the signiﬁcant attributes of ELF, and their poten-
tial in decolorizing dyes. Further exploration into new bioremedia-
tive potential of ELF can be conducted in future.
