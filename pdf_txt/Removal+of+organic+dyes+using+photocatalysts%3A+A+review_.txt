ABSTRACT  
Dye removal from wastewater is a key environmental concern because of the adverse impacts that these compounds can have on aquatic ecosystems and human 
health. The management and disposal of concentrated wastewater, particularly dye -containing wastewater, poses significant environmental issues from generation 
to disposal. Conventional water treatment proc edures including filtration, flotation, and adsorption are non -destructive physical separation processes. Photocatalysis 
has proven to be a promising and efficient approach for dye degradation in wastewater treatment operations. The process inclu des formin g and interacting with 
extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals under specific activation conditions. These radicals effectively destroy and mineralize recalcitrant organic contaminants. This 
review begins with a brief introduction of dye pollution, dye classi fication, and dye treatment strategies then moves on to the process of photocatalytic degradation, 
the investigation of various photocatalysts for dye degradation, and the factors that influence dye photodegradation.

Introduction  
Dyes are essential to the dyeing and textile industries. Over 100,000 commercially available synthetic dyes are commonly util ised in these industries.1, 2 
Dyes are mostly generated from coal tar and petroleum intermediates, with an annual production of over 7×105 tons.3 Textile waste effluents discharge 
around 15% (1,000 tons) of non -biodegradable textile dyes  into natural streams and bodies of water annually.4 Each kilogramme of cloth treated in dyeing 
and finishing operations consumes around 120 -280 L of water.2

 According to Konstantinou and Albanis, industrial and textile dyes are among the most hazardous chemical substances.5 The textile finishing and dyeing 
industries contribute significantly to water pollution (17 -20%), according to World Bank estimat es.6 Kant's study found that 72 of the primary hazardous 
compounds in wastewater were primarily generated by textile dyeing, with approximately 30 of these substances being untreatab le.7 In 1974, the 
Ecological and Toxicological Association of the Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry (ETAD) was established to protect consumers and the environment 
by collaborating with the government to address concerns about the toxicologic al impact of their products.8 In an ETAD survey, 90% of 4000 tested dyes 
were found to  LD 50 values exceed 2 ×103 mg/kg. The highest rates were seen in diazo, direct, and basic dyes.9  
Azo dyes are the most common type of colourant, accounting for about 50% of all dyes used in industry. Azo dyes have a double  bond of 40 nitrogen 
atoms ( -N=N -), with at least one connected to an aroma tic group (such as naphthalene or benzene rings). Table 1. shows the types, characteristics, 
applications and dye fixation % of dyes.10, 11

Reusing and recycling wastewater effluents can supplement limited fresh water supplies and offset future water needs.12 Over the years, several practical 
tactics have been used to produce effective wastewater treatment systems.13 Biological treatments can produce secondary pollution, including health -International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews,  Vol 5, no 2, pp 29 55-2968 February 2024                                      2957  
 
 threatening ba cteria and difficult -to-remove organic compounds, despite their short -term effectiveness in eliminating contaminants from wastewater.14 
Developing environmentally friendly and sustainable water treatment methods is crucial.15 
Dye treatment strategies  
The increasing production of dyes due to industrialization has necessitated appropriate treatment, regardless of their physic al side e ffects and toxicity.16 
To address challenging efflue nts, many solutions have been tested to decrease their environmental impact.17  
1. Biological treatment  
The treatment method removes contaminants through logical action, focusing on biodegradable organic compounds.17 Biological treatment is used in 
sectors like food processing, dairy, brewing, paper, plastics, and petrochemicals to deal with biodegradable materials.18 Some dyes can be treated, but 
many are resistant to biological breakdown or cannot be transformed under aerobic conditions.19 Anaerobic treatment has been shown to effectively 
degrade many synthetic colours.20 Despite successful efforts to decolorize dyes under aerobic conditions, most azo dyes are still c onsidered non -
biodegradable in normal aerobic systems.21 The biological techni que is typically more cost -effective as it involves fungal decolorization, microbial 
degradation, adsorption by living or dead microbial biomass, and bioremediation systems.22 To cleanse industrial wastewater, microorganisms like 
bacteria, yeast, algae, and fungi are used. This microbe c an breakdown and collect a variety of contaminants.23 However, its applicatio n is sometimes 
limited due to technical constraints.24 The downsides of biological methods include the need for a huge surface area, sensitivity to diurnal variations, 
chemical toxicity, and limited design and operational flexibility.25 Compared to conventional biodegr adation procedures, this method does not effectively 
eliminate colour.26 While certain organic compounds can be efficiently destroyed using this approach, others are unmanageable due to their complicated 
chemical structure and synthetic origin. This approach is not suitable for azo dyes due to their xenobiotic nature and inabil ity to breakdown entirely.27 
2. Physical treatment  
Physical unit operation is a treatment method that primarily uses physical forces. Physical methods include adsorption as wel l as membrane -filtration 
technologies including nanofiltratio n, reverse osmosis, and electrodialysis.28 Screening, mixing, flocculation, sedimentat ion, flotation, and filtration are 
commonly used industrial methods. Physical methods are utilised to enhance or treat wastewater without causing significant ch emical or biological 
changes.29 Adsorption, also known as equilibrium separation, is a good approach for water purification. Physical wastewater treatment ex ploits natural 
forces like gravity, electricity, and  van der Waal to remove contaminants.30 Physical therapy procedures often do not alter the chemical stru cture of target 
substances. Vaporisation and filtration can alter the physical state of substances and induce agglomeration.31 Filtration technology is essential for drinking 
water and wastewater treatment, including microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis.32 This has been evaluated for colour 
removal. Each membrane technique is best suited for specific water treatment purposes.33 
3. Chemical treatment  
Chemical unit methods are similar to physical treatment in that they do not involve any microorganisms in the treatment of wastewater.11 Chemical 
treatment involves converting or removing pollutants.34 Chemical treatments include precipitation and adsorption and disinfection. Chemical treatment 
is commonly employed to clean industrial wastewa ter due to the presence of contaminants that microorganisms cannot effectively eliminate.35 
Additionally, the procedure requires adding substances like aluminium, calcium, or ferric ions to the  dye effluent to promote flocculation.36  
Other agents have also been utilised in the procedure. Combining two factors can enhance the process.37 Although economically feasible, the method 
might be costly because to the high cost of chemicals. The technique has a downside of producing significant amounts of conce ntrated sludge that is pH -
dependent.38 
4. Ph otcatalytic treatment  
Photocatalysis is a method that uses light irradiation and a semiconductor photocatalyst to do both oxidation and reduction.39 This method varies from 
previous treatment procedures.  Fig 1. Shows advantages of photocatalyst in wastewater treatment.40 Various semiconductor materials, such as TiO 2, ZnO, 
Fe2O3, SnO 2, ZrO 2, CdS, and ZnS, have been utilised as catalysts to degrade organic conta minants and dyes.41 Photocatalysis is a dependable and effective 
way to degrade dyes in water, as evidenced by numerous research.42 Table 2. summarises photocatalytic dye degradation methods used in previous 
literature.  International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews,  Vol 5, no 2, pp 29 55-2968 February 2024                                      2958

Heterogeneous photocatalysis utilising semiconductor materials typically involves a light harvesting antenna and many active species to degrade 
pollutants. The photon triggered surface undergoes a series of chain oxidative -reductive processes, as proposed as follows:43 
Photocatalyst + h v → h+ + e-                                                                                            (1)

h+ + OH− → OH∙                                                                                                       (3)  
h+ + Dye → (Dye)+                                                                                                   (4)  
e− + O 2  → ∙O2−                                                                                                                                                           (5) 
∙O2− + H+  → HO 2∙                                                                                                  (6)

H2O2 + O 2  → OH∙ + OH− + O2                                                                               (8)  
H2O2 + hv → 2OH∙                                                                                                  (9)  
Pollutant + (OH ∙, h+, OOH∙ or O2) → degradation product                                   (10) 
When a semiconductor is exposed to ultra -band -gap light (h v > E g), a valence band (VB) electron (e-) is stimulated to the conduction band (CB), resulting 
in a photogenerated hole (h+) at the VB. The generated e-/h+ couples can move to the  semiconductor surface and participate in redox processes.44 
Photocatalytic reactions typically involve three active speci es: hydroxyl radical (·OH), h+, and superoxide radical (·O 2-). ·OH is the major oxidant in 
pollutant breakdown in aqueous solution. There are typically two routes for generating ·OH radicals.45 (i) Photogenerated h+ can easily oxidise H 2O and 
OH- in water to form ·OH radicals. (ii) Photogenerated e can reduce O 2 in aqueous solution to form ·O 2- radicals, which can then react with h+ to form 
·OOH radicals.46 Photogenerated h+ is an effective oxidant for degrading organic contaminants, with varying capacities depending on catalyst t ype and 
oxidation circumstanc es.47 Photo -induced e- can easily recombine with h+ when there are no electron or hole scavengers present.48 Scavengers play an 
important role in reducing rate of  recombination of charge carriers and improving efficiency of photocatalytic. Fig 2. depicts  schematic illustration of 
generation of reactive oxygen species on surface of photocatalytic semiconductor.49

The initial dye concentration in a photocatalysis is another important component to consider.76 Research suggests that when dye concentration increases, 
percentage degradation decreases while maintaining a constant catalyst  concentration.77 As the concentration of the dye increases, more organic molecules 
are adsorbed on the catalys t surface, resulting in less photons reaching the catalyst surface and less •OH formation, thus inhibiting the degradation.78 
2. Effect of pH  
The pH of dyes has a considerable impact on photodegradation effectiveness. Changi ng the pH of a solution influences the surface charge of catalyst 
particles and the probability of catalytic reactions.79 The adsorption of dye on the s urface changes, altering the reaction rate. The reactions listed below 
can be used to protonate or deprotonate the catalyst's surface under acidic or alkaline circumstances:  
Photocatalyst + H+ →  Photocatalyst H+ 
Photocatalyst + OH- →  Photocatalyst + H 2O 
Surface of photocatalyst maintain a positive charge in acidic and negative charge in alkaline environments.52 If a catalyst has a stronger oxidising activity 
at lower pH, however too much H+ can slow down the reaction. Acid Yellow17, an anionic dye, degrades most quickly at pH 3, while Orange II and 
Amido Black 10B deteriorate the most at pH 9.44, 57  
3. Effect of catalyst dose  
The amount of photocata lyst used also influences dye degradation.  
Increased catalyst concentration leads to dye degradation, indicating heterogeneous photocatalysis.80 Increasing the amount of catalyst on the 
photocatalyst surface leads to more active sites and more •OH radicals, which can contribute to dye discolouration.81 When the catalyst level exceeds a 
particular threshold, the solut ion becomes turbid, preventing UV rays from reaching the process. As a result, percentage degradation decreases.82 
4. Adsorption of dyes  
The adsorption of dyes on photocatalyst surfaces has a major impact  on dye degradation performance. Dye molecules adsorb on catalyst surfaces through 
electrostatic interactions and binding affinities. Adsorption of dyes on catalyst surfaces is crucial for photodegradation of  dyes. Dye adsorption, whether 
strong or weak, l eads to decreased photocatalytic efficacy in catalysts. Strong adsorption poisons catalysts, whereas weak adsorption attaches  dyes to 
catalyst surfaces for photodegradation reactions.83 High dye adsorption on catalyst surfaces prevents photons from reaching the surface. Strong adsorption 
leads to decreased photoca talytic activity. The Sabatier principle suggests that for optimal photocatalytic activity, dye molecules should not attach s trongly 
or weakly to catalyst surfaces. The moderate is helpful due to the synergy between photocatalysis and adsorption for enhanc ed photodegradation 
performance.84 
5. Intensity of light  
Light en ergy plays an important role in the photocatalytic degradation of dyes.  
Irradiation causes photocatalysts to produce positive holes and electrons in their valence and conduction bands.85 Positive holes and electrons can o nly 
arise when radiation energy exceeds or equals the photocatalyst's band gap.86  
6. Effect of temperature  
Experiments have been conducted to investigate how temperature aff ects the rate of organic compound breakdown. Several studies have examined the 
impact of photocatalytic activity on temperature.87 As temperature rises, charge carriers recombine and adsorbed reactants desorb, leading to decreased 
photocatalytic activity.88 According to the Arrhenius equation, the apparent first order rate constant (K app) increases linearly with e xp(−1/T).  
Intermediate species  
Photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants should result in the release of water, carbon dioxide, and tiny inorganic compounds. Photocatalytic 
degradation of organic dyes can result in the creation of several tiny int ermediates due to their complicated structures.89 Typically, the generation of 
intermediaries in photocatalytic treatment is not monitored.  
The intermediates generated may be more toxic than the original dyes. Catechol can be produced as a byproduct during photocat alytic phe nol degradation. 
Catechol is more harmful to animals than phenol. To further understand the nature and fate of intermediates produced during p hotocatalytic treatment, 
further research is necessary.5 International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews,  Vol 5, no 2, pp 29 55-2968 February 2024                                      2964  
 
 Electron –hole recombination  
Photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants is affected by electron and positive hole production a nd recombination, as previously discussed. 
Photoluminescence analysis is often used to evaluate electron and positive hole recombination rates.90 The photocatalyst emits light inversely proportional 
to the rate of electron and positive hole recombination. The photocatalyst emits radiations by transferring electrons from th e conduction band to the 
valence band. If the photocatal yst contains components such as quantum dots or graphene oxide, the intensity of emitted radiation may not accurately 
reflect electron and positive hole recombination rates. Similarly, radical scavenging and open -circuit potentiometry are employed to asses s electron and 
positive hole recombination rates. None of these methods produce unambiguous and accurate information. To accurately anticipa te the rate of electron 
and positive hole recombination, new methodologies must be developed.91 
Conclusions  
It is concluded that as the textile business rises, so does the demand for diverse dyes. Only a small percentage of the produced wastewater is appropriately 
managed. The leftover trash is frequently collected or thrown directly into the sewer system, where it eventually finds up in  rivers, lakes, or streams. 
Concentrat ed wastewater management and disposal, particularly dye -containing wastewater, create significant environmental challenges from generation 
to disposal. Conventional water treatment technologies such as filtration, flotation, and adsorption are physical sep aration processes that do not cause 
damage. Photocatalysis has proven to be a promising and effective method of dye degradation in wastewater treatment facilitie s. Under certain activation 
conditions, the process involves the generation and interaction of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. These radicals effectively degrade and mineralize 
organic pollutants that are resistant to other treatments.
