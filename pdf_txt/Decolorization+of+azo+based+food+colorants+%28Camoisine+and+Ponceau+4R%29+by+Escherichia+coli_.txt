Abstract
The aim of the present study was to standardize and to assess the predictive value of the cytogenetic analysis
by Micronucleus (MN) test in fish erythrocytes as a biomarker for marine environmental contamination. Micronucleus
frequency baseline in erythrocytes was evaluated in and genotoxic potential of a common chemical was determinedin fish experimentally exposed in aquarium under controlled conditions. Fish ( Therapon jaruba ) were exposed for 96
hrs to a single heavy metal (mercuric chloride). Chromosomal damage was determined as micronuclei frequency infish erythrocytes. Significant increase in MN frequency was observed in erythrocytes of fish exposed to mercuricchloride. Concentration of 0.25 ppm induced the highest MN frequency (2.95 micronucleated cells/1000 cells comparedto 1 MNcell/1000 cells in control animals). The study revealed that micronucleus test, as an index of cumulativeexposure, appears to be a sensitive model to evaluate genotoxic compounds in fish under controlled conditions.

1. Introduction
In India, about 200 tons of mercury and its
compounds are introduced into the environment
annually as effluents from industries (Saffi, 1981).Mercuric chloride has been used in agriculture as afungicide, in medicine as a topical antiseptic anddisinfectant, and in chemistry as an intermediate in
the production of other mercury compounds. The
contamination of aquatic ecosystems by heavymetals and pesticides has gained increasing attentionin recent decades. Chronic exposure to andaccumulation of these chemicals in aquatic biotacan result in tissue burdens that produce adverseeffects not only in the directly exposed organisms,but also in human beings.
Fish provides a suitable model for monitoring
aquatic genotoxicity and wastewater qualitybecause of its ability to metabolize xenobiotics andaccumulated pollutants. A micronucleus assay hasbeen used successfully in several species (De Flora,et al ., 1993, Al-Sabti and Metcalfe, 1995). The
micronucleus (MN) test has been developedtogether with DNA-unwinding assays asperspective methods for mass monitoring ofclastogenicity and genotoxicity in fish and mussels(Dailianis et al.,  2003).
The MN tests have been successfully used as
a measure of genotoxic stress in fish, under bothlaboratory and field conditions. In 2006 Soumendra
et al., made an attempt to detect genetic biomarkers
in two fish species, Labeo bata andOreochromis
mossambica, by MN and binucleate (BN)
erythrocytes in the gill and kidney erythrocytes
exposed to thermal power plant discharge atTitagarh Thermal Power Plant, Kolkata, India.
The present study was conducted to determine
the acute genotoxicity of the heavy metal compoundHgCl
2 in static systems. Mercuric chloride is toxic,
solvable in water hence it can penetrate the aquaticanimals. Mutagenic studies with native fish speciesrepresent an important effort in determining thepotential effects of toxic agents. This study wascarried out to evaluate the use of the micronucleustest (MN) for the estimation of aquatic pollutionusing marine edible fish under lab conditions.

Abstract
	 In	this	study,	an	attempt	was	made	to	isolate	methyl	red,	an	azo	dye,	decolorizing	 bacteria	from	textile	effluent.	Among	
three isolates with methyl red decolorizing ability, the potential bacterial isolates, Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain  
AUCASVE3 	was	selected	for	identification 	and	characterization. 	The	organism 	was	found	to	belong	to	the	genus	  
Staphylococcus  and species saprophyticus . The isolate Staphylococcus saprophyticus  strain AUCASVE3 could  
decolorize 600, 700, 800, and 1000 mg/L of methyl red within 24 h and 48 h, respectively, in presence of 1.0 g/L of glucose. This  
bacterium showed 94 and 97% methyl red (600 mg/L) decolorization within 24 and 48 h, respectively. In case of  
temperature, the ranging between 30-40ºC was fond to be suitable for the decolorization by S. saprophyticus  strain  
AUCASVE3 and a further increase in the temperature drastically affected decolorization activity of bacterial culture.  
Thus, due to high potential for methyl red decolorization the isolate Staphylococcus saprophyticus  strain AUCASVE3  
can	be	used	in	the	biological	treatment	plant	of	industrial	effluent	containing	azo	dyes.

1. Introduction
	 Dyes 	are	the	colored	substances 	which	fixes	firmly	
with the substrate. Synthetic dyes are used extensively 
for textile dying, paper printing, and color photography. 
Approximately 10,000 different dyes and pigments are 
used industrially and over 7 X 105 tons of these dyes 
are produced annually worldwide. Dyes are broadly  
classified	 in	to	several	types.	Based	on	the	chemical  
structure of chromophoric group, synthetic dyes 
are classified as azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes,  
triarylmethane dyes, etc. These dyes have an adverse 
effect	on	the	environment.	 Disposal	 of	effluent	in	soil	
and river prevents the penetration of sunlight in them. 
These Dyes are toxic, carcinogenic and genotoxic 
because of their high COD values. In textile industries  
azo dyes play a major role in colouring process. Azo 
dyes	are	considered	 as	electron	deficient	 xenobiotic  
components because they possess azo (N=N) and|  
sulphonic (-SO3-) electron withdrawing groups,  
generating electron deficiency and making the  
component less susceptible to oxidative catabolism by 
bacteria. They are not typically degraded under aerobic 
conditions. Azo dyes are mainly used in dyeing textile 
fibers,	particularly	 cotton	but	also	silk,	wool,	viscose	
and	synthetic	 fibers.	At	present	there	are	around	3,000	
azo dyes in use worldwide and they account for 65% 
of the commercial dyes. Azo dyes are the largest group of dyes used in industry (Ramalho et al., 2002)  
representing more than half of the annual production 
(Stolz, 2001). It has been estimated that about 10% of 
the dye stuff used during this dyeing processes does 
not	bind	to	the	fibers	and	is	therefore	 released	into	the	
sewage treatment systems or environment (Zollinger, 
1987).
 Microbial decolorization and degradation is 
an alternative approaches to physical and chemical  
degradation processes of color removal, which is 
environment friendly and cost effective (Wesenberg 
et al., 2003). Most studies on azo dye biodegradation 
have focused on bacteria and fungi, which are able to 
biodegrade and bioadsorb the dyes in textile industry  
effluents	(Pearce	 et al., 2003; Eichlerova et al., 2006). 
The organisms used in most of the studies were  
Staphylococcus  sp, Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp, 
Clostridium  sp, and Pseudomonas  sp. in bacteria  
(McMullan et al., 2001). Mechanism for decolorization  
of azo dyes by microrganims has been proposed by 
Keck et al . (1997). Anaerobic and micro-aerophilic  
microorganisms	 reduce	azo	bonds	non-specifically	 in	
anaerobic conditions leading to dye decolorization. 
 In the present study, the potentiality of the aerobic  
decolorization of methyl red (MR) by Staphylococcus  
saprophyticus  strain AUCASVE3 growing on a  
synthetic medium was studied. This bacterial strain, 
isolated from dye contaminated sludge, decolorizes 33methyl red. The effects of different temperatures on 
the decolorization of methyl red by Staphylococcus 
saprophyticus  strain AUCASVE3 were studied and 
compared. Objectives of present work are as follows: 
 1. Isolation, screening and identification of  
highly Potential azo dye (methyl red) decolorizing 
bacteria.
	 2.	 Determination	 of	color	removal	efficiency	 of	
methyl red by isolated bacteria.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Isolation of methyl red decolorizing bacteria
 Dye-contaminated sludge was collected from a 
wastewater outlet of an industrial area of Dhaka Export 
Processing Zone (Saver).
 Approximately, 1 g of sludge was suspended in  
10 ml of sterile 0.85% sodium chloride solution (w/v) 
and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was serially diluted 
with sterile 0.85% sodium chloride solution. Aliquots of 
0.1 ml of 10–1, 10–2 and 10–3 dilutions were spreaded onto 
minimum medium (MM) plates containing: K2HPO4, 
1.36 g/L; MgSO4, 0.1 g/L; (NH4)2SO4, 0.6 g/L; CaCl2, 
0.02 g/L; NaCl, 0.5 g/L; MnSO4, 1.1 mg/L; ZnSO4, 0.2 
mg/L; CuSO4, 0.2 mg/L; FeSO4 0.14 mg/L; MR, 100 
mg/L; agar, 15 g/L and pH was adjusted to 7 with HCl 
and NaOH (Moutaouakkil et. al ., 2003) All plates were 
incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Colonies surrounded by 
decolorized zones were picked and streaked onto MM 
plates containing 100 mg/L of MR. The plates were 
again	incubated	 under	the	same	conditions	 to	confirm	
their abilities to decolorize MR.
2.2. Preparation of methyl red solution 
 Methyl red was dissolved in 50 per cent ethanol. 
Stock of 1000 mg/L methyl red solution was prepared by 
dissolving 10.0 g of methyl red in 1000 ml 50 per cent 
ethanol. The methyl red solutions for the experiments  
were prepared by diluting the stock solution to obtain 
desired concentrations.
2.3. Test of decolorizing potentialities by using  
Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain AUCASVE3 
organism 
 For this test viz. methyl red at different  
concentrations  were used. This dye compound at  
different concentration viz. 600, 700, 800, and 1000 
µg/ml was mixed with mineral salt media. These  
modified broths were inoculated with the  
Staphylococcus saprophyticus  strain AUCASVE3  
isolated from the waste samples and incubated at 37ºC for 7 days. The decolorization was observed  
periodically. 
2.4. Spectrophotometric analysis of the dye tested 
 Percentages of dye decolorization by the culture 
were measured by UV-visible spectrophotometer 
(Jenway 6310). Decolorization of the methyl red was 
determined at the respective maximum absorption 
wavelength (430 nm) in the culture supernatants  
using spectrophotometer. Samples were aseptically  
taken into the centrifuge tube at different times  
intervals during incubation. Cells were removed by  
centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. Percentage of  
dye decolorization was calculated by the following  
formula.
2.5. Identification of the bacterial isolate
 Bacterial staining, cultural, morphological 
and biochemical procedures were studied for the  
identification 	of	bacterial	isolate.	Isolated	bacteria	were	
identified	 according	 to	methods	described	 in	Bergey’s	
Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (Buchanan, 
1984).
2.6. Sequence based identification of isolates
 The isolates can be identified based on  
alignment of partial sequence of 16S rRNA gene with  
the existing sequences available in the database. In  
the present experiment the bacterial isolates were 
used	to	amplify	their	16S	rRNA	gene.	PCR	amplified  
DNA of the isolate was gel purified using phenol 
freeze method and sent for automated sequencing  
(Applied Biosystem 3130). The sequence generated from  
automated 	sequencing 	of	PCR	amplified 	DNA	was	
analyzed through NCBI BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.  
nlm.nih.gov/) 	program	to	find	out	possible	similar	  
organism through alignment of homologous  
sequences.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Isolation and screening of methyl red decolorizing 
bacteria
 Methyl red decolorizing bacteria were isolated 
from	textile	effluent.	On	the	basis	of	their	decolorizing	
capacity, a total of three bacteria were isolated and  
purified by repeated sub-culturing. These three  
bacteria had potentials to grow on liquid culture media  In the present study, the potentiality of the aerobic decolorization of methyl red by 
Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain AUCASVE3 growing on a synthetic medium was studied. This 
bacterial strain, isolated from dye contaminated sludge, decolorizes methyl red. The effects of different 
temperatures on the decolorization of methyl red by Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain AUCASVE3 
were studied and compared. Objectives of present work are as follows:

synthetic medium at 37°C. The temperature ranging between 30- 40ºC was fond to be suitable for the 
decolorization by S. saprophyticus strain AUCASVE3 and a further increase in the temper ature 
drastically affected decolorization activity of bacterial culture.
Moreover, decolorization and degradation can also detoxify the effluent. Recent works have 
revealed the existence of a wide variety of microorganisms capable of decolorizing a wide range of dyes. 
So, the high methyl red decolorization rate and decolorization efficiency of Staphylococcus saprophyticus
strain AUCASVE3 enable this bacterium to be used in the biological treatment of industrial effluent containing azo dyes.020406080100

 Effect of temperature on dye decolorization was 
studied and the results were shown in the Fig. 3 A 
and B. Better decolorization was observed between 
30-40ºC temperatures by the isolate Staphylococcus  
saprophyticus strain AUCASVE3.
