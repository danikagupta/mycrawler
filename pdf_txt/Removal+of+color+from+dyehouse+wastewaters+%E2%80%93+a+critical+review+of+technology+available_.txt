Removing Acid Dyes From Textile
Wastewater Using Biomass
For Decolorization
Introduction
Mounting pressure on the textile in-
dustry to treat dyehouse effluents has
led to a host of new and old technol-
ogies competing to provide cost-effec-
tive solutions. Among the oldest of
methods for treatment of wastewater is
the use of adsorbents derived from bio-
logical matter, or biomass. Because of
its low cost and widespread availability,
biomass has often been investigated,
with some promising results, but ap-
parently failing the ultimate test of com-
mercial viability. In this article we crit-
ically examine recent developments in
the use of biomass for decolorization of
dyehouse wastewater-specifically, for
removal of acidic dyes. General reviews
of textile wastewater treatment options
are available,1,2 as are yearly guides to
the literature.3,4 A brief literature review
of biomass dye absorbents is provided
by Yang et al.5
Acidic dyes are water-soluble mole-
cules containing one or more anionic
groups (most often sulfonic acid).
Representative classes of anionic dyes
include the acid, direct, mordant, and
reactive dyes. This paper ignores cat-
ionic and disperse dyes, although these
too have been the subject of studies
concerning dye adsorption by bio-
mass.6-11 Anionic dyes, particularly the
reactive dyes, seemingly pose a more
difficult and expensive treatment prob-
lem than cationic and disperse dyes,
The term biomass, if taken to its
logical extreme, could be interpreted to
include a wide range of materials. How-
ever, for our purposes, biomass refers

to dead plant and animal matter such
as agricultural, forest, fermentation and
shellfish byproducts or wastes. This
definition of biomass therefore excludes
discussion of charcoals, activated car-
bons, clays, soils, diatomaceous earth,
activated sludges, compost, living plant
communities (i.e., biological treatment
systems), polymers synthesized from
petrochemicals, and inorganic salt
coagulants.
Decolorization effect
Biomass decolorizes textile waste-
water by adsorption and ion exchange
mechanisms. A description of the per-
formance characteristics of an ideal
acidic-dye adsorbent would be for it to
have high capacity and rapid binding
kinetics, to be easily and inexpensively
regenerated, and to have binding pro-
perties which are insensitive to dyebath
electrolytes, other additives, and pH. It
is a given that the biomass should be
abundantly available and very inexpen-
sive. Apart from these latter two qual-
ities, however, biomass sources lack
many of these performance attributes
unless subjected to some kind of chem-
ical modification. As it will be docu-
mented herein, some simple chemical
alterations can dramatically improve the
dye-binding characteristics of biomass
substrates.
Because there is no “standard” dye
or protocol used by all to test biomass
samples, it is difficult to make direct
comparisons. The binding capacity of a
biomass substrate will depend on the
size and charge of the dye. Conditions
which can influence dye binding, and
thus the apparent dye binding capacity,
such as solution pH and salt content,
are often not disclosed in reports. For
the purposes of this review, it is assum-
ed that capacities were determinedunder optimal conditions and sufficient
time was allowed to achieve equilibrium.
Also, binding capacity is not reported in
a uniform manner in the literature.
Herein, binding capacities for a particu-
lar dye are discussed in terms of moles
of dye bound per Kg of dry biomass
(mol/Kg). The charge of the dye is iden-
tified when known. With substrates for
which ion exchange clearly is the bind-
ing mechanism, capacity is presented
in terms of milliequivalents per Kg of dry
biomass (eq/Kg).
Dye Adsorption Studies
Chitin and chitosan
Chitin, a polymer of N-acetyl
glucosamine obtained from shellfish
waste, has been examined for its dye
binding ability. McKay et al.12 reported
that chitin has a binding capacity for
Acid Blue 25 (Telon Blue ANL, a
monovalent anion) of about 0.45 mol/Kg.
Smith et al.13 found that chitin bound
0.13 mol/Kg of Acid Red 1, a divalent
anion. The dye-binding kinetics of chitin
are very slow, unfortunately, requiring
five days to reach equilibrium with Acid
Blue 25.14 The effects of temperature
on binding capacity varied among the
various dyes tested, but for Acid Blue
25 increased temperature decreases
binding capacity. The influence of elec-
trolyte concentration and solution pH on
dye binding is apparently unknown.
Treatment of chitin with strong base
produces the deacylated form of chitin
called chitosan. Chitosan, which is solu-
ble in moderately acidic solutions, is
available from several commercial
sources in various degrees of deacyla-
tion, purity, and form. A particulate form
of chitosan was reported to have a
capacity of 0.45 mol/Kg for Acid Red
1.13 However, when tested with the dye
flowing through a packed bed of chito-
I7san, the Acid Red 1 capacity was only
0.014 mol/Kg. Similarly, the Acid Blue
25 adsorption capacity of chitosan was
0.032 mol/Kg in packed bed tests. The
low dye binding values observed under
the non-equilibrium conditions of packed
beds reflect the poor dye-binding
kinetics of particulate chitosan.
Chitosan can be spun into fibers,15
which apparently have much improved
absorption kinetics. Chemically cross
linking the chitosan fibers allows the
fibers to be used at low pH, which im-
proves their dye-binding capacity, with-
out solubilizing the chitosan.l6,17
Moderately crosslinked chitosan fiber
was found to have an Acid Orange II (a
monovalent anion) binding capacity of
about 4.5 mol/Kg at pH 3-4. Capacity
decreases with increasing pH and tem-
perature, but is little affected by low-to-
moderate salt concentrations, The
crosslinked fibers can be regenerated
by treatment with NaOH.
Chitosan also can be cast into mem-
branes and then crosslinked to produce
filters with good physical and chemical
stability and high water permeability.l8
Chitosan membranes thus would be ex-
pected to have very rapid dye adsorp-
tion kinetics, in addition to good capac-
ity, although there are no reports in the
literature to this effect.
Microbial biomass
Many industrially useful fungi contain
chitin and chitosan in their cell walls.19
Hence, the fungal biomass byproducts
of industrial fermentation processes can
serve as an alternative to crustacea as
a source of chitin-based dye ad-
sorbents. The cell wall of Myrothecium
verrucaria was shown to bind azo dyes,
including Acid Orange II and Acid Red
114 (a divalent anion).*0 Dye binding to
the fungal material was moderately
slow, requiring 4-6 h to reach equilib-
rium.
Although not explicitly stated in the
work, based on the information given,
the capacities are about 0.05 mol/Kg for
Acid Orange II and 0.11 mol/Kg for Acid
Red 114. The biomass dye-binding ca-
pacity can be partially regenerated by
extraction with methanol. The observa-
tion that the divalent dye (Acid Red 114)
bound to a greater extent than the
monovalent dye (Acid Orange II) to the
M. verrucaria cell wall was not ex-
plained, nor is it consistent with the bind-
ing behavior of chitin and chitosan de-
scribed above. Note that decolorization
of textile wastewater by fungal meta-
bolic activity is the subject of many
studies,21-23 but discussion of biode-gradative processes falls outside the
purview of this work.
Bacterial biomass has been shown to
adsorb textile dyes. Hu24 examined the
adsorption of eleven reactive dyes to
Aeromonas biomass. Dye binds to the
bacteria cell wall fraction, which, unlike
other materials discussed so far, is not
composed of chitin or chitosan. The
capacity of the Aeromonas biomass for
Reactive Yellow 2 (a trivalent anion) was
reported to be 0.08 mol/Kg at pH 4.5.24
Dye absorption kinetics were moder-
ately fast, with equilibrium reached
within 2 h. No method to regenerate the
biomass was indicated.
Unmodified lignocellulose biomass
Forest and agricultural production
byproducts have been long considered
as potential dye adsorbents. Unfortu-
nately, without prior chemical modifica-tion these materials uniformly have very
low adsorption capacities for acidic
dyes. McKay et al.6 examined wood
bark, rice husk, and cotton waste for
their ability to bind Congo Red (a
divalent anion) and observed negligible
amounts of adsorption. Similarly, Abo-
elela and El-Dib25 reported wood shav-
ings to have a capacity for Congo Red
of 0.001 mol/Kg. The binding of Acid
Blue 25 to sugarcane bagasse is slow
(greater than 3 h for equilibrium to be
reached) and the capacity only 0.05
mol/Kg.7.26 Maize (corn) cob also bound
Acid Blue 25 slowly, requiring more than
3 h to reach equilibrium, and to an ex-
tent of 0.1 molKg.27 Peat moss and
rice hulls adsorb Lanasyn Black BRI
ABK (a monovalent anion) moderately
fast (equilibrium time less than 2 h) and
to an extent of about 0.13 and 0.14
mol/Kg, respectively.28 Note, however,
Amerlcan Dyestuff Reporter August 1994 10that the rice hulls had been treated with
an unidentified cationic detergent,
which may have influenced dye adsorp-
tion.
In the author’s hands, rice hulls that
have not been pretreated with cationic
detergent failed to demonstrate any sig-
nificant amount of acid dye adsorption.
Clearly, the commercial potential of raw
lignocellulosic materials for the treat-
mentof textile wastewater is extremely
low.
Chemically-modified cellulose
and lignocellulose
In much the same way that chemical
modification of chitin improves its dye
adsorption characteristics, derivatiza-
tionof cellulose or lignocellulosic
biomass can dramatically improve their
dye binding properties. Hwang and
Chen29.31 describe the grafting of poly-
amide-epichlorohydrin (PAE) polymer
ontocellulose. This material, compos-
ed of l0-30% cellulose, has a high ad-
sorption capacity for acidic dyes. The
adsorption capacity for Direct Blue 86
(a divalent anion) of the PAE-cellulose
(25% cellulose) material is 1 .O mol/Kg.
Unfortunately, the rate of dye adsorp-
tion is very slow, requiring three days
at 30°C to reach equilibrium. The ap-
parent absorption capacity of PAE-cel-
lulose is pH dependent (similar to
chitosan). It is not known to what extent
dyebath electrolytes influence dye bind-
ing, nor whether PAE-cellulose can be
regenerated.
Youssef32 describes the chemical
modification of cellulose (cotton) with
the N-methyl derivatives of tris- and bis-
(2-carbamoylethyl)ethylamine to en-
hance acid dye adsorption. Acid Blue 13
(a divalent anion) bound maximally to
the 30% “bis” derivative to the extent
of about 0.013 mol/Kg. Equilibrium with
the dye was reached within 30 min, indi-
cating excellent absorption kinetics.
Dye adsorption decreased with increas-
ing pH, as would be expected for a
weak, tertiary amine ion exchanger. Dye
was readily removed from the cellulose
derivative with NaOH.
Quaternary ammonium groups can
be introduced into cellulose and ligno-
cellulosic materials using (not surpris-
ingly) the same chemistries as em-
ployed for cotton fabrics.33 The quater-
nary ammonium group introduces a per-
manent positive charge into the sub-
strate, making the materials very effec-
tive acidic dye adsorbents. Gangneux et
al.34.36 demonstrated that quaternized
cellulose (Solka Floc BW 100) having
anexchange capacity of 0.6-0.7 eq/Kg,bound acid, direct, and reactive dyes.
Equilibrium adsorption of dye was
achieved in less than 2 h. Similarly, a
commercially available quaternized
cellulose (WRL 200A, Water Research
Laboratory A/S, Denmark) was shown to
bind unidentified azo dyes, and to be
readily regenerated by desorbing bound
dye with a solution containing NaCl andlignocellulose substrates seem to offer
the best potential for the treatment of
acidic dye-containing effluents.
However, some form of crosslinked
chitosan also appears promising
because of its superior capaci-
ty.

While quaternized cellulose has most
of the desired performance character-
istics (high capacity, rapid kinetics, etc),
it fails to retain the most important
attribute-low cost. Presumably, this is
due to the cost of preparing pure cellu-
lose, not because of the cost of quater-
nization. Low cost adsorbents can beDyers. Colour. 1993, 109, 97-100.

Conclusions
Of the many kinds of biomass dye ad-
sorbents described, few have the nec-
essary performance characteristics to
be seriously considered for com-
mercialization. Table I provides a sum-
mary of the biomass types discussed,
their capacities for various dyes, and an
indication of their major drawback for
utilization as absorbents for dyes in tex-
tile wastewater. Only the crosslinked
chitosan fibers and the quaternized
cellulose and lignocellulose materials
have adequate dye binding capacity and
rapid equilibrium kinetics, and are easily
regenerated. And of these, only quater-
nized (ligno)cellulose is insensitive to
dyebath pH. Therefore, based on price
