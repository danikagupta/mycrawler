ABSTRACT  
Laccases belong  to the large family of multicopper oxidases (MCOs) that couple t he one -electron 
oxidation of  substrates  with the four -electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water . Because 
of their high relati ve nonspecific oxidation capacity particularly on phenols and aromatic amines 
and the lack of requirement for expensive  organic cofactors, they have found application in a 
large number of biotechnological and industrial fields. The vast majority of studies and 
applications were  performed using fungal laccases but b acterial laccases show interesting 
properties for diverse biotechnological applications  such as optimal temperature above 50 C, 
optimal pH at the neutral to alkaline range, thermal and chemical stability and increased salt 
tolerance. Additionally, b acterial systems benefit from a wide range of molecular biology t ools 
that facilitates the ir engineering and achievement of high yields of protein production and the  
set-up of cost effective bioprocesses.  In this review we will provide  up to date  information on 
the distribution and putative physiological role of bacterial laccases , will highlight their 
distinctive structural and biochemical properties , discuss t he key role of copper in the biophysical 
and biochemical properties,  unveil  thermostability determinants  and finally , will review 
biotechnological  applications with a focus on the putative catalytic mechanisms  of phenolics and 
aromatic amines.  
DISTRIBUTION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE OF LACCASE S IN THE 
PROKARYOTIC WORLD  
Laccases act on a surprisingly wide range of substrates, including diphenols, polyphenols, 
differently substituted phenols, diamines, aromatic amines, benzenethiols, and even some 
inorganic compounds such as  metal ions  such as Mn(II), Cu(I)  and Fe(II). Laccases are  claimed 
to be one of the oldest enzymes ever isolated that for almost have been mostly characterized 
from plan and fungal sources  (Mayer and Staples 2002 ), however in the last two decades  a wide 
number of laccases of prokaryotic origin have been identified and characterised ; for recent 
reviews see (Martins et a l. 2015 ; Chandra and Chowdhary 2015 ; Tonin et al. 2016 ; Chauhan et 
al. 2017 ; Guan et al. 2018 ). In Fig. 1 a phylogenetic analysis is shown with laccases which genes 
were  cloned and enzymes were characterized  (sequences retrieved from NCBI ( Table 1 )). In the 
next sub-sections  we will discuss the physiological relevance of proteins within the different 
groups.  
Proteins involved in copper resistance. The distribution of laccases  involved in copper 
resistance in the phylogenetic tree suggests that this is a physiological role widely conserved in 2 
 bacteria. Copper is a redox active metal with two different oxidation states, Cu(I) and Cu(II), 
that is a micronutrie nt required by livin g organisms that in excessive amounts exerts cellular 
toxicity . The microorganisms have developed different mechanisms of copper resistance that 
includes the action of MCOs playing a role in oxidising Cu(I)  to the less toxic Cu(II) in the 
periplasm (Pérez et al. 2018 ). A.1. CueO . Escherichia coli  CueO, one of the best characterized 
MCO, involved in copper resistance (Grass and Rensing 2001 ) is included in a phylogenetic 
branch including different enzymes from proteobacteria. CueO, i n addition of oxidizing Cu(I)  in 
the periplasmic space, also oxidizes catecholate siderophores, avoiding that Cu(II)  is reduced 
back to Cu(I)  (Grass et al. 2004 ). cueO  is regulated at the  transcriptional level by CueR that  also 
regulates the copper ATPase efflux CopA, which works in coordination with CueO in copper 
detoxification  (Outten et al. 2000 ; Rademacher and Masepohl 2012 ). A.2. PcoA. In addition to  
CueO which is chromosomally encoded (Outten et al. 2001 ), some E. coli  strains possess another 
plasmid encoded MCO involved in copper resistance mechanism s (Brown et al. 1995 ). This 
MCO was named PcoA and similarly to CueO shows cuprous oxidase activity in the periplasm 
(Huffman et al. 2002 ). The operon contains 7 genes and its expression from two different 
promoters is controlled by a two -components regulatory system encoded within the same operon 
(Rouch and Brown 1997 ). Proteins with similarity to PcoA have been detected in other 
gammaproteob acteria, as in Pseudomonas syringae  (Cha and Cooksey 1991 ) or 
Stenotrophomonas  maltophilia  (Galai et al. 2011 ), and named CopA, the same name used for 
the copper efflux ATPase associated to CueO. The presence of these genes in microorganisms 
able to degrade lignin and their enzymatic activity on lignin m odel compounds has been 
considered as an indication of a possible role in lignin degradation (Granja -Travez and Bugg 
2018 ). A.3. MCOs in Myxococcus xanthus . Myxococcus xanthus , a deltaproteobacterium with 
a complex life cycle encodes three different MCO (CuoA, CuoB and CuoC) involved in copper 
resistance (Muñoz -Dorado et al. 2016 ). CuoB and CuoC cluster with an enzyme fr om the 
alphaproteobacterium Pedomicrobium  and the CuoA  one is in a different branch ( Fig. 2). CuoB 
is involved in an  immediate response reaching a maximum after 2 hours of  copp er adition 
(Sanchez -Sutil et al. 2007 ); the expression of cuoB  is regulated by the extracyto plasmic sigma 
factor (ECF) CorE which activity is activated by Cu(II)  and inactive d in the presence of Cu(I)  
(Marcos -Torres et al. 20 16).  CuoA and CuoC, participate in the copper response maintenance 
and are s lowly induced reaching a maximum at 24 h. This response is regulated by the two -
component regulatory system CosSR, which periplasmic domain is responsible for Cu sensing 
(Sánchez -Sutil et al. 2016 ). A.4. MCOs in Firmicutes. The involvement of MCOs in copper 
resistance has been also described in some Firmicutes  as it is the case of Staphyloccus aureus 
that synthesizes a MCO whose gene expression is induced by copper and which deletion  resulted 
in an increased copper sensitivity (Sitthisak et al. 2005 ). The genes coding for the S. aureus  MCO 
have been detected in mobile genetic elements present in many clinical isolates and proposed to 
play a role in virulence (Zapotoczna et al. 2018 ). Pediococcus and Lactobacillus  synthesize 
MCOs that are very close in the phylogenetic tree to the S. aureus  enzyme. These enzymes have 
been studied  after recombinant production showing enzymatic activity and the capacity to 
degrade biogenic amines (Callejon et al. 2016 , 2017 ) 3 
   
Figure 1. Phylogenetic relationship of bacterial multicopper oxidases with reported laccase activity . The phylogenetic analysis 
was performed using the program MEGA X with sequences aligned by the program MUSCLE built into MEGA   (Kumar et al. 
2018). The tree using the Neighbor -Joining (NJ) method is drawn  to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the 
evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the p -distance method 
and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences p er site. The final display of the tree was obtained by using iTOL 
(Letunic and Bork 2019 ). A tree was also constructed by the Maximum Likehood (ML) method. Numbers at branches indicate 
bootstrap values higher than 80% for the NJ method and the boostrap vaule obtained with the ML method in those branches. The 
enzymes in the same group are marked with the same color and are annotated as explained in the text. Phylogenetic relationshi p 
of bacterial multicopper oxidases with reported laccase  activity.

 A5. Other MCOs involved in copper resistance. The expression of gene coding for CutO  from  
Rhodobacter capsulatus was shown to be  induced at high copper concentrations through a 
regulatory mechanism operating at the post -transcriptional level (Rademacher et al. 2012 ). 
Similarly the gene coding for the MCO of Campylobacter jejuni  is induced with high copper 
concentrations and the mutation of the gene determines an increase in copper sensitivity (Hall et 
al. 2008 )  
B. Proteins involved in spore pigmentation. This group comprises the most well studied 
bacterial laccase, CotA , from  Bacillus  subtilis  (Hullo et al. 2001 ; Martins et al. 2002 ). Most of 
the laccases identified in Bacillus  are part of the outer coat that protects spores from a diverse 
range of stre sses, playing roles in the biosynthesis of a brown melanin -like spore pigment and 
protection from UV -light and hydrogen peroxide  and cluster in the same group  as shown in the 
tree (Table 1 and references in there) . Very related to those proteins is a laccase synthesized by 
the archaeum Haloferax volcanii  that had been most likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer 
from bacteria of the phyla Firmicutes  (Uthandi et al. 2010 ). Some proteins of actinobacteria are 
found closely associated to the Bacillus  CotA ( Figure 2), for example,  phenoxazinone synthase 
Phs from Streptomyces antibioticus  that catalyses the oxidation of aminophenol r equired for the 
synthesis of  secondary metabolites, such as the antibiotic actinomycin . As an alternative 
physiological role, it was proposed that Phs could participate in spore pigment synthesis similarly 
to CotA -laccases  (Jones 2000 ).  
C. Small laccases in Streptomyces . Some laccases from from actinobacteria of the Order 
Actinomycetales  are in a clearly differentiated branch (Fig ure 1). This group contains the secreted 
enzymes denominated “Small laccases” (SLACS) characterized by having only two structural 
domains and the Streptomyces  coelicolor  enzymes id the m ost extensively characterized  laccase 
(Machczynski et al. 2004 ). These  are secreted enzymes  that have been implicated in 
morphogenesis, sporulation, pigmentation, ligninocellulose degradation, bacteria -bacteria 
interactions or antibiotic production  (Table 1 and references in there) . 
D. Laccases in plant associated proteobacteria. The Marinomonas mediterranea  laccase PpoA 
was one of the first bacterial laccases described (Solano et al. 1997 ). This protein is a membrane 
associated protein showing an N -terminal His rich region which could be related to its capacity 
to oxidize not only the substrates characteristic of laccases, but also the monophenol L -tyrosine 
(Solano et al. 2001 ; Sanchez -Amat et al. 2001 ). The physiological role of PpoA is unknown; 
mutant strains lacking this protein are not affected in pigment synth esis and no evidences for 
involvement in Cu resistance were found (Fernandez et al. 1999 ). The laccase Ralstonia 
solanacearum  laccase was propose d to participate  in defence against phenolic compounds 
(Hernandez -Romero et al. 2005 ). This could relate to the association of the producing bacteria 
with plants: M. mediterranea  was isolated from the microbiota of the marine plant Posidonia 
oceanica (Espinosa et al. 2010 ), R. solanecarum  is a plant pathogen and Rhizobium  is a symbiont 
of plants (Pawlik et al. 2016 ). 
E. Laccases in thermophilic bacteria (and archaea ). Several  MCOs from thermophilic and 
hyperthermophilic bacteria that cluster in the same group (Miyazaki 2005 ; Fernandes et al. 2007 ; 
Kalyani et al. 2016 ; Navas et al. 2019 ). Notably, the MCO from Thermus thermophilus  shows 
extreme stability at high temp eratures with a half -life at 80 C of around 14 h (Miyazaki 2005 ). 
This group also comprises the only hyperthermophilic archaeal -type MCO , designated McoP 5 
 from Pyrobaculum  aerophilum  (Fernandes  et al. 2010 ). A MCO was also characterized from  
Aquifex aeolicus  that grows optimally at 89 C and occupies the deepest branch of the bacterial 
phylogenetic tree  (Fernandes et al. 2007 ).  The gene coding for McoA is part of a putative copper -
resistance determinant and the enzyme was shown to exhibit higher efficiency for Cu (I) and 
Fe(II)  metal ions than for aromatic substrates.  
F and G.  Other groups.  There are other clusters revealed by the phylogenetic analyses for which 
no physiological role has been yet proposed. For example, t he MCO from Thermus thermophilus  
HJA shows a small molecular mass  (Kim et al. 2015 ) and is not included in the same group that 
other enzymes from the same species which are in group E . Genes encoding proteins similar to 
those in group F can be detected in other bacteria, including some E. coli strains (Kim et al. 
2015 ) but their physiological role remains unknown.  
STRUCTURE, MECHANISMS  AND BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES  
These enzymes have three distinct copper sites, Cu types 1, 2 and 3; the oxidation of the reducing 
substrate occurs at the type 1 (T1) Cu site while the reduction of O 2 occurs at the T2/T3 trinuclear 
cluster (Jones and Solomon 2015 ). The coordination of the copper centres is largely conserved 
among laccases. The oxidation of the reducing subst rates occur at the T1 -Cu site while the 
reduction of O 2 occurs at the T2/T3 trinuclear cluster (Figure 2 ) (Solomon et al. 1996 ; Jones and 
Solomo n 2015 ; Kosman 2010 , 2017 ). The T1 Cu is coordinated by two histidine  nitrogen atoms 
and a cysteine sulphur and it is characterised by an intense S(π) →Cu(d x2-y2) charge transfer 
absorption band at around 600 nm, ε 600nm > 3000 M-1 cm-1 responsible for the intense blue colour 
of the enzymes.  The T2 copper site, strategically positioned close to the T3 binuclear copper 
centre, is usually coordinated by two histidine residues and a water (or hydroxyl) molecule, while 
each T3 copper is coordinated by three histidines and a bridging ligand such as  a hydroxyl 
moiety, displaying an absorption in the near -UV, with λ max = 330 nm.  The mononuclear T1 Cu 
site interacts with the trinuclear cluster T2/T3 through  the highly conserved HCH motif, where 
the cysteine binding to the T1 Cu shuttles electrons to ea ch of the adjacent histidines binding to 
one of the T3 copper ions. T he routes of electron transfer, the oxidation states of the Cu centres 
and the mechanism of oxygen reduction in laccases were recently reviewed; please s ee (Jones 
and Solomon 2015 ). 
The first three dimensional structures of prokaryotic laccases were reported for E. coli  CueO 
(Roberts et al. 2002 ) and Bacilus subtilis  CotA -laccase (Enguita et al. 2003 ), followed by 
Streptomyces coelicolor  SLAC (Skalova et al. 2009 ), Pyrobaculum aerophilum  McoP (Sakuraba 
et al. 2011 ) Campylobacter jejuni  McoC (Silva et al. 2012 ), Streptomyces sviceus  Ssl1 (Gunne 
et al. 2014 ) and more recently Ochrobactrum  sp. CueO (Granja -Travez et al. 2018 ). Structural 
information is also available for the Tht Thermus thermophila  HB27 laccase in the Protein 
Database Bank (Serrano -Posada et al. 2011 ). The overall bacterial laccase structural fold 
comprises the typical three cupredoxin -type domains, c haracterised by a Greek key -barrel 
topology (Hakulinen and Rouvinen 2015 ) (Fig 2 ). Laccases from  Streptomyces , as well  as 
Amycolatopsis  sp. 75iv2, designed SLACs ( small laccases)) lack the second of the three domains 
and their crystal structures reveal a trimeric quaternary arrangement of the two -domain protein 
chains (Skalova et al. 2009 ; Komori et al. 2009 ; Gunne et al. 2014 ; Majumdar et al. 2014 ). 
Evolutionary theories proposed two -domain proteins as the intermediate  step in the evolution 6 
 between one domain proteins with a cupredoxin fold, and three domain laccases (Nakamura and 
Go 2005 ; Komori et al. 2009 ).

(residues 1 -173, domain 1: blue to green; residues 182 -340, domain 2: green to yellow; residues 369 -501, domain 3: yellow  to 
red). The four copper atoms are shown as yellow spheres. Pictures drawn in PyMol software using the deposited structure

In bacterial laccases the T1 Cu is weakly coordinated by an axial ligand, a methionine, in 
tetrahedral geometry. Fungal lac cases have non -coordinating phenylalanine or leucine at this 
position , favouring a t rigonal planar geometry for the  site, that may contribute  to the higher redox 
potential  ( 800 mV)  observed in these enzymes as compared to of bacterial ones ( 500 mV)  
(Xu et al. 1999 ; Durao et al. 2006 ; Hong et al. 2011 ). However,  variations in redox potential of 
the T1 center observed among laccases cannot be assigned to this  single structural feature but to 
a sum of factors including the nature of the second sphere residues influencing solvent 
accessibility, hydrogen bonding, and dielectric anisotropy around the site  (Durao et al. 2008b ; 
Matera et al. 2008 ; Marshall et al. 2009 ).  
In general, laccases  show a broad binding pocket buried between domain 1 and 3 and close to 
the T1 -Cu centre primarily stabilised through hydrophobic interactions (Hakulinen and 
Rouvinen 2015 ). In B. subtilis  CotA -laccase the T1 Cu centr e is sited at the bottom of the 
substrate binding region, relatively exposed to the solvent and interacting with the substrate 
molecules through the imidazole ring of one of its His ligands (Enguita et al. 2004 ) similarly to 
what was observed in fungal structures complexed with phenolics or related substrate s (Bertrand 
et al. 2002 ; Hakulinen et al. 2002 ; Matera et al. 2008 ). However, in the remainder of 3 -domain 
bacterial laccases whose structures have been reported the T1 site is occluded by several 
secondary structure elements, with varied l ength, composition and structure  (Figure 3 ). The 
small  substrate binding pocket  of these enzymes seems  to be in accordance to the ir higher 
specificity to small metal ions Cu (I) and Fe(II)  (Singh et al. 2004 ; Fernandes et al. 2010 ; Silva 
et al. 2012 ), indicating that these MCOs should behave predominantly as metallo -oxidases in 
their native microorganisms  with a role in copper resistance (please see above) . However, even 
7 
 at reduced efficiency these enzymes are also able to oxidise phen olic or non -phen olic substrates 
and it is plausible that the y possess additional binding pockets  to accommodate bulkier  substrate s 
(Zaitsev et al. 1999 ; Liu et al. 2011 ; Bello et al. 2014 ).

Cu center in E. coli  CueO (magenta, PDB 1KV7), C. jejuni  McoC (red, PDB 3ZX1), P. aerophilum  McOP (green, PDB 3AW5) 
and T. thermophilus  Tth (cyan, 2XU9). (B)  B. subtilis  CotA -laccase (PDB 1w6L) shows a widely exposed T1 -Cu centre. Cu 
ions are represented as dark orange spheres.  
One important structural distinctive feature of bacterial laccases as compared  to those of fungal 
origin is the l ack of negatively charged residues in the substrate binding pocket with 
consequences in the optimal pH for substrates with phenolic or aromatic amine functional 
groups. Fungal laccases contain a conserved acidic residue ( either an Asp or Glu) close to the T1 
Cu centre that in their carboxylate form, i.e. in acidic conditions, are able to hydrogen bond with 
OH or NH 2 groups of substrates aiding in their deprotonation by stabilising the radicals formed 
during the catalytic r eaction (Bertrand et al. 2002 ; Kallio et al. 2009 ; Madzak et al. 2006 ). In the 
case of bacterial laccases such as B. subtilis  CotA -laccase, in the absence of negatively charge 
residues close to the T1 Cu centre, the oxidation relies ma inly in the substrates structures, in 
particular, in their protonation/deprotonation equilibria, which is dependent of the pKa values  
(d'Acunzo and Galli 2003 ). Considering that oxidative enzymatic reactions are more prone to 
occur after deprotonation of OH or NH 2 groups, fungal laccases show an optimal pH at the a cidic 
range and bacterial laccases at the neutral to alkaline range, above the pKa value of the respective 
phenolic and aromatic amines substrates  (Pereira et al. 2009a ; Pereira et al. 2009b ; Rosado et al. 
2012 ). 
COPPER ROLE AND STABILITY DETERMINANTS OF BACTERIAL MCOs  
Copper incorporation in MCOs is still a poorly understood process and remains an important 
issue of discussion in the current literature  (Kosman 2017 ) . Understandin g this mechanism is 
important both at  the biochemical, spectroscopic and structural viewpoints but also from  a 
biotechnological perspective since copper depletion is a limiting factor to achieve full catalytic 
activity and stability with consequences in the implementation of cost -effective industrial 
applications . Bacterial laccases are typically  heterologously overproduced in the cytoplasm of 
E. coli   that contains limiting concentrati ons of copper (10  µM) in aerobic conditions due to the 
operation of copper homeostasis mechanisms  (Changela et al. 2003 ). In order t o surpass this 
limitation E. coli  cells needs to be cultivated under microaerobic growth conditions (in copper -
8 
 supplemented media ) where sig nificantly higher amounts of copper accumulates allowing t he 
production of fully copper loaded recombinant laccases (Durao et al. 2008a ).  
The key role of copper to the stability and folding of CotA laccase . The CotA laccase from 
Bacillus subtilis  has been used as one  model to dissect stability  features and determinants  of 
multi -copper oxidases . The lon g-term stability of CotA revealed  that the enzyme denatures 
irreversibly according to a simple pathway of unfolding and deactivation (first -order process) 
with a half -life of inactivation of 50 -172 min (at 80°C) depending on the pH and copper content  
(Durao et al. 2008a ; Fernandes et al. 2011 ; Brander et al. 2014 ). This value is larger than the 
half-life of B. clausii  CotA (20 min ) but smaller than the 350 , 540  and 868 min measured for the 
thermophilic laccases from T. terrenum , C. thermarum  and T. thermophiles , respectively 
(Miyazaki 2005 ; Brander et al. 2014 , 2015 ; Ghatge et al. 2018 ). The thermodynamic stability of 
B. subtilis  CotA was further  characterised showing that a t 25°C the native state is very stable 
with a free energy change of 10 kcal/mol and a mid -point of 4.6  M guanidinium hydrochloride 
upon unfolding of the tertiary structure (Durao et al. 2006 ). These studies showed  that copper 
depletion from the T1 site is the key event in the inactivation of CotA laccase preced ing the  
unfolding of the secondary and tertiary structure s similarly to the reported  in plant Rhus 
vernicifera  laccase (Agostinelli et al. 1995 ) and Coriolus hirsutus  and Coriolus zonatus fungal 
laccases  (Koroleva et al. 2001 ), and an unfolding pathway was  proposed as shown in Box 1  
(Durao et al. 2006 ; Fernandes et al. 2012 ). Copper depletion affects the kcat values of the enzymes 
and the T1 Cu site redox potential  EºT1 of the holoprotein  is 525 nm as compared to 455 mV of 
the partially depleted enzyme (2.5 moles of copper per mole of protein) (Durao et al. 2006 ; Durao 
et al. 2008a ). 
 
 
 
 
Box 1 - Chemically -induced unfolding pathways of CotA laccase where N, I and U are the native, intermediate and unfolded 
states, respectively, and Agg is an aggregated state.  
The role of copper in CotA laccase  was addressed in more detail  to reveal a subtle balance 
between copper loading and enzyme folding ; please see a recent review on MCOs metallation 
(Kosman 2017 ). Copper incorporation was sho wn to be critical in the fine tuning of  CotA -laccas  
folding in the cytoplasm of E. coli  (Durao et al. 2008a ). Firstly,  the production of fully copper 
loaded CotA preparation s in E. coli  cells was shown to be  achieved after a switch from aerobic 
to microaerobic growth conditions  that favour the presence of Cu(I) ion in E. coli  cytoplasm . 
Secondly , in vitro  copper incorporation into apo -CotA  preparations  result in a fully copper 
loaded enzyme only if Cu(I) and not Cu(II) is used. It was shown that t he small structural 
rearrangement that occurs in vivo  when copper is incorporated seems to occur in the vicinity of 
the T2 copper site and persists after copper depletion in vitro . The results clearly indicated that 
Cu(I)  is the most efficient Cu redox state and its incorporation during enzyme folding in vivo  is 
key to achieve a fully copper loaded and fully functional and stable enzyme.  
A sequential copper incorporation  was proposed , with the T1 site being the first to be  
reconstituted  in vitro , followed by the T2 and T3 centers (Durao et al. 2008a ) similarly to what CotA -laccase  
 
Holo -CotA laccase           N ↔  Nno copper  →  U    
Apo-CotA laccase            N  ↔  I  ↔  U    
Holo -CotA laccase           N ↔  Nno copper ↔  I  ↔  U  →  →  Agg  9 
 was described in E. coli  CueO  (Galli et al. 2004 ). It is the T1 site that provides a template for the 
assembly of the native protein indicating that the ancestral cupredoxin is the starting point for 
assembly of a fully metallated protein (Kosman 2017 ). The mutant G304K of CueO laccase may 
well be a good example of structural tuning imparted by copper binding taking place in this case 
in vitro  (Wang et al. 2018 ). Addition of copper induced conformational changes in a methionine -
rich helix and in a regulatory loop resulting in enhanced activity. Mol ecular dynamics 
simulations of the holo - and apo -forms of the multicopper oxidase from Thermus thermophilus  
HB27 also revealed a different conformation for the linker connecting the β -strands 21 and 24 
of the cupredoxin fold with possible implications in t he process of electron transfer (Bello et al. 
2012 ). Timely copper incorporation into the multicopper oxidase ceruloplasmin  is also crucial 
to prevent misfolding and assure successful biosynthesis in vivo  (Sedlak and Wittung -Stafshede 
2007 ). 
Deeper insight into the unfolding pathway and cop per incorporation in CotA was gathered 
through acid -induced unfolding and double -jump stopped -flow experiments (Fernandes et al. 
2012 ). In these double -jump experiments, CotA was first unfold ed by a decrease in pH and after 
fixed time interval s when the enzyme unfolds in a del ay loop (20 -1000 ms) refolding was  
promoted by mixing the unfolded enzyme preparation with a b uffer at higher pH . If CotA 
unfold ed according to a two -state process where only the native and the unfolded states 
accumulate , a simple refolding phase would be observed. On the contrary, if an intermediate 
accumulate d between the native and the unfolded state two refolding phases would be observed 
especially for longer delay times where the accumulation of the unfolded state becomes more 
significant. Apo -CotA display two refolding phases at delay times over 200  ms indi cating that a 
three -state process describes the unfolding of the enzyme. Even in the absence of copper there 
is an intermediate in between the native and the unfolded only revealed through kinetic 
measurements as shown in Box 1 . The apo -form of human cerul oplasmin also unfolds with at 
least one intermediate (Palm -Espling et al. 2012 ). Double -jump experiments for holo -CotA also 
revealed the presence of an intermediate in between the nat ive and the unfolded state , indicating 
that the presence of copper in the unfolded holo -protein prevents its refolding back to the native 
state due to protein aggregation as summarised in Box 1 . In summary, copper has to be 
incorporated at later stages of in vitro  folding (Fernandes et al. 2012 ) but this incorporation is 
important to adjust the struct ure to obtain a fully functional and stable enzyme (Durao et al. 
2008a ). 
The removal of the single intradomain disulfide bridge of the CotA laccase showed  no significant 
effects at the structural or functional levels (Fernandes et al. 2011 ). Conformational dynamics 
are known to be affected by copper binding such as in the case of the multicopper oxidase Fet3p 
and the copper c haperones Atox1 and CopZ (Sedlak and Wittung -Stafshede 2007 ; Palm -Espling 
et al. 2012 ) and the Thermus thermophilus  HB27 laccase (Bello et al. 2012 ).  Interestingly not 
only the unfolding kinetics of CotA measured by stopped -flow, which report on the free energy 
change between the native and the transition state ar e faster for the mutant protein, indicating  
that the native state is less stable in the absence of the disulfide bridge , but additi onally, the 
kinetics of copper release is increased in the mutant . Overall the results indicate that the CotA 
disulfide -bond has a role in tuning  copper binding a the key parameter in the folding and stability 
of CotA .  10 
 The hype rthermophilic nature of the A. aeolicus  McoA and P. aerophilum  McoP.  The 
thermal stability of the  hyperthermostable  metallo -oxidases from A. aeolicus  (McoA) 
(Fernandes et al. 2009 ) and P. aerophilum  (McoP ) (Fernandes et al. 2010 ) was studied by DSC 
reveal ing the  complex process characterised by three independent thermal transitions showing 
Tm values of 105, 110 and 114°C for McoA  and 97, 102 and 112°C for McoP . Three independent 
thermal transitions were also observed for ascorbate oxidase (Savini et al. 1990 ), ceruloplasmin 
(Bonaccorsi di Patti et al. 1990 ) and CotA laccase (Durao et al. 2008a ) and seem to correlate  
well with the structural organisation of three cupredoxin -like domains for the respective 
enzymes . The high thermal stability of both McoA and McoP is in agreement with  a significant 
long-term stability ; McoP display a half -life time of 5.5  h at 80°C (Fernandes et al. 2010 ) while 
McoA shows a more complex deactivation pathway due to protein aggregation but the first -order 
deactivation step is characterised by a half -life time of 5.7  h at 80°C (Fernandes et al. 2007 ). 
Despite the hyperthermophilic nature of both enzymes, the chemical -induced unfolding reveals 
a relatively low thermodynamic stability  especially for McoA with a mid -point of 2.7 M 
guanidinium hydrochloride and a free energy change in buffer at 25 °C of 2.8 kcal/mol  
(Fernandes et al. 2009 ). Copper depletion from McoA precedes largely the unfolding of the 
tertiary structure and is the key event for inactivation in the presence of chemical denaturants as 
mentioned previously f or CotA. The low equilibrium thermodynamic stability measured for 
McoA refers thus to the apo form (Fernandes et al. 2009 ; Pozdnyakova et al. 2001 ). A fast 
unfolding rate constant for the apo form compared to the holo form was measured; this was 
assigned to the stabilising effect of copper on the native state and quantified as 1.5 kcal/mol, 
which is very similar to the value of 1.4 kcal/mol measured for CotA using a different approach 
(Durao et al. 2006 ). Copper loading increases the stability of McoA  and the dependence of 
stability on temperature becomes less flat ( Fig 4A ). Interestingly , a flat dependence of the free 
energy change on temperature is one of the mechanisms that leads to enhanced thermal stability 
in proteins from thermophiles  (Fitter and Heberle 2000 ; Robic et al. 2003 ). The c omparison 
between the stability curves of McoA and CotA clearly shows that the flat dependence of stability 
on temperature observed for McoA allows the protein to remain folded over a wider range of 
tempe ratures as compared with CotA ( Fig 4B). For McoA, the flat dependence of stability on 
temperature imposed by a low heat capacity change upon unfolding ( 0.5 compared to 2.6 kcal 
mol-1 K-1 for CotA ) results from the aggregation of the enzyme as proved by gel filtration 
chromatograph y and light scattering measurements. From a mechanistically point of view, the 
aggregation process confers residual structure to the final state resulting in a low heat capacity 
change and a flat dependence of stability on temperature. One hypothesis is th at McoA suffers 
kinetic partitioning between aggregation and first -order deactivation which is an uncommon 
feature seldom observed for other enzymes (Baptista et al. 2003 ) that can explain the low heat 
capacity change. This hypothesis is in accordance with the low cooperativeness of the transition 
from the folded to further states under equilibrium conditions as evaluated by the thermodynamic 
parameter m (-1.0  0.1 kcal.mol-1 M-1); both the heat capacity change  and m correlate to the 
amount of surface area exposed upon unfolding. This atypical behaviour of McoA explains the 
low thermodynamic stability observed upon chemical -induced destabilisation but 
simultaneously contributes to an increased  stability over a wider r ange of temperatures and thus 
to the hyperthermophilic nature of McoA.  11

APPLICATION OF BACTERIAL LACCASES IN OXIDATIVE BIOPROCESSES  
Oxidation of lignin -related phenolic and non -phenolic compounds using b acterial laccases. 
Laccases are promising ligninolytic enzymes and therefore i t is expected that the number of 
laccase -based industrial oxidation processes will increase significantly in  the next years in 
particular in the lignocellulose biorefinery field.  Enzymatic depolymerisation of lignin into 
phenolic platform chemicals is envisaged as one of the potential environmentally friendly 
breakthrough applications for the successful valorisation of lignin bio -wastes  (Sun et al. 2018 ). 
The fragmentation of lignin into lower molecular weight fractions with increased reactivity, 
bioequivalents, for ex ample, to oil -based compounds used as resins, adhesives, composites, and 
foams is crucial for its valorisation . Bacterial laccases have been successfully tested in the 
oxidation of eucalyptus kraft pulp (Arias et al. 2003 ; Eugenio et al. 2011 ), wheat straw pulps 
(Zheng et al. 2012 ), kraft lignin (Huang et al. 2013 ), diverse hardwood and softwood 
lignocellulose samples (Sondhi et al. 2015 ; Singh et al. 2017 ), woody materials (Goacher et al. 
2018 ; Navas et al. 2019 ), lignin samples and a broad range of low molecular weight lignin model 
compounds (Moya et al. 2011 ; Huang et al. 2013 ; Reiss et al. 2013 ; Majumdar et al. 2014 ; 
Hamalainen et al. 2018 ) confirming their potential in lignin degradation and valorisation.  
The enzymatic oxidation of phenols is based in one electron abstraction which generates 
resonance -stabilised phenoxy  radicals. These may undergo a second enzyme -catalysed oxidation 
into quinonic structures, or react further in non -enzymatic reactions (hydration, 
disproportionation or homo and heteromolecular coupling reactions giving to oligo - or polymeric 
products) (Mogharabi and Faramarzi 2014 ; Kudanga et al. 2017 ; Romero -Guido et al. 2018 ). 
Most of reports  using bacterial laccases for the oxidation of lignin -related phenolic acids, 
including sinapic, ferulic, caffeic and coumaric acids leads to the formation of dimeric structures  
(Koschorreck et al. 2 008; Ricklefs et al. 2014 ; Xie et al. 2015 ). The phenolics oxidation was 
shown to be affected  by substituents in the ortho  positions, with a preference in the oxidation of 
syringyl -type over the guaiacyl - or hydroxyphenyl -subunits and the carbon chain length at the 
para  position of the phenyl group. Phenolic and non -phenolic dimeric β -O-4 compound s, for 
12 
 example  guaiacyl glycerol --guacyl ether (GGE) and adlerol,  models to study the C−C bond 
cleavage , that  represent more than 50% of lignin structure, were used as substrates by s everal 
bacterial laccases ; SLCAS  from S. coelicolor  A3(2), S. lividans  TK24, S. viridosporus  T7A and 
Amycolatopsis  sp. 75iv2  (Majumdar et al. 2014 ), CopA from P. putida  KT2440 and P. 
fluorescens  Pf-5 (Granja -Travez and Bugg 2018 ), CueO from Ochrobactrum  sp. (Granja -Travez 
et al. 2018 ), CtLac from C. thermarum  (Ghatge et al. 2018 ) and the Thermus sp. 2.9 laccase 
(Navas et al. 2019 ). Overall, the tested  bacterial laccases catalyses the oxid ative coupling of GGE 
units, but  not the cleavage of the C−C bond  with the exception of B. amyloliquefaciens CotA 
that degraded GGE in a set of products identified as guaiacol , 4-vinylguaiacol, vanillin and other 
related compounds  (Yang et al. 2 018). The presence of these compounds indicate that the main 
degradation pathway of GGE follows the oxidation of C  and the cleavage of -O-4 and C -C 
bonds , highlighting the potential of the B. amyloliquefaciens CotA  laccase for lignin degradation.  
A mechanism of lignin -related phenolics oxidation and their role in mediating non -phenolics by 
bacterial laccases was thoroughly described (Fig. 5) (Rosado et al. 2012 ). The oxidation rates 
for three syringyl -type phenolic models (syringaldehyde (SA), acetosyringone (AS) ) and methyl 
syringate (MS) were measured showing that the enzymatic rates ( SA > AS >˃ MS) are in line 
with the electron withd rawing capability o f the para -substituting groups ( aldehyde (SA) > ketone 
(AS) > ester (MS) ), and concordant with the pKa values (and oxi dation potential) of compounds  
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. The catalytic cycle of laccase -mediator systems 
showing the formation of intermediate radicals  upon oxidation of 
the phenolic substrates and the routes  leading to the formation of 
different oxidation products (adapted from Rosado et al 2012). 
The phenoxy  radicals are not only involved in the oxidation of the 
non-phenolics but additionally are involved in the formation of 
2,6-dimethoxy -p-benzoquinone (DMBQ), other phenolic 
compounds and in coupling reactions, which can include radical 
recombination, cross -coupling and self -coupling proceeding with 
or without release of substituent groups.  
 
 
 
(SA < AS < MS ). The positive effect of electron -withdrawn substituents in the rates of enzymatic 
oxidation suggest that these improve the  stabilisation of the phenolate anions. The results 
indicate  that TvL oxidises the three substrates in the phenolic form (maximal rat es at pH 4) while 
CotA oxidises them optimally in the phenolate form  (maximal rates at 8 -9), i.e. after 
deprotonation of the phenolic group. The action of these phenolics were tested as “natural” 
laccase mediators (present in lignocellulose, cheap and envi ronment -friendly avoiding the latent 
toxicity and high cost of synthetic mediators (Camarero et al. 2005 ; Canas and Camarero 2010 ; 
Fillat et al. 2010 )) for the oxidation of the non -phenolics, veratraldehyde, 4 -methoxybenzyl 
alcohol and 3,4,5 -trimethoxybenzyl alcohol. Interestingly, t he mediator activity of the syringyl -
type phenolic  reflected  a balance between reactivity and stability of the radicals formed  as the 
13 
 measured conversion yields of non -phenolics was higher for MS > AS > SA, showing that the 
stability of radicals is improv ed by the presence of electron donor groups at the para -position . 
Moreover, maximal conversion yields  (up to 80%) were achieved at large excess of mediators 
(10:1) implying  an interplay  of competitive routes (Fig. 5). Phenoxy  radicals  intermediates are 
involved  in (i) the oxidation of the non -phenolic monomers, forming hydroxybenzyl  radicals 
that are converted to the correspondent aldehydes, (ii) the conversion to 2,6 -dimethoxy -p-
benzoquinone and, finally (iii) coupling reactions including radical recombination, cross -
coupling and self -coupling, with or without release of sub stituent groups . This catalytic cycle 
point s out the need to control the reaction conditions in order to guide the depolymerisation /re-
polymerisation  balance of lignin samples (Rosa do et al. 2012 ). 
Although laccases can play a major role  in lignin depolymerization , the achievement of a correct 
balance between the depolymerisation and re -polymerisation processes is though as the great 
challenge (Roth and Spiess 2015 ; Hamalainen et al. 2018 ). This balance depends on several 
reaction conditions including the substrate structures, the difference between the redox potentials 
of enzyme and substrate, pH of reaction, temperatu re and solvent. Recent advances highlighted 
the potential of bacterial laccases as a promising tool to tackle the lignin depolymerisation/re -
polymerisation bottleneck. MetZyme® LIGNOTM, a laccase of  bacterial origin, was successfully 
used for lignin depolymerisation  at 50 C at pH 10.5 where lignin is soluble in water (Hamalainen 
et al. 2018 ). After the enzymatic treatment, extensive lignin depolymerisation wa s observed 
accompanied by chemical activation via demethylation and benzylic oxidation as well as 
increased solubil ity in neutral and acidic pH.  Importantly, organic solvent -free soluble lignin 
fractions with defined molecular weights were obtained  using membrane separation technologies 
with increased dispersibility and solubility in water. The reaction mechanism proposed for the 
laccase -mediated oxidation of lignin at alkaline pH  is a benzylic oxidation at the C  position of 
the lignin unit s (Fig. 6).  This modification  is expected to lead to  change s in the electronic nature 
of the substituent  leading to a drop in the pKa of the phenolic group from 9 -11 to 7 -8.  For the 
phenolic units , this change is responsible for  increased l ignin solubility at neutral to acidic pH.

phenolic lignin units oxidation using a 
MetZyme® LIGNOTM at alkaline conditions 
(pH 10.5) (adapted  from (Hamalainen et al. 
2018 )).   
 
For the non -phenolic units, the electron withdrawing nature of the para -substituent group 
promote depolymerisation or demethylation reactions in the lignin polymer. Therefore the 
authors demonstrate that depolymerisation of lignin prevailed over polymerisa tion pathways at 
strong alkaline and aeration conditions (Hamalainen et al. 2018 ). This enzymatic -based solution 
14 
 open up new opportunities for lignin valorisation crucial to make economically feasible present 
and future lignocellulose biorefineries.  
Oxidation of aromatic amines using b acterial laccases. Substituted aromatic amines including 
The bacterial CotA  laccase oxidises at the neutral to alkaline range of pH values  a wide range of 
aromatic amines with different substitution patterns ( ortho -phenyldiamines, substituted para -
diphenylamines, ortho -amino -phenols, among other ) that are precursors of dimeric an d trimeric 
dyes (Sousa et al.  2013 ; Sousa et al. 2016 ; Sousa et al. 2019 ) as well as of substituted heterocyclic 
frameworks (phenazine, phenoxazinone, carbazole derivatives) (Sousa et al. 2014 ; Sousa et al. 
2015 ; Sousa et al. 2018 ). Phenazine and phenoxazine cores are multifunctional and versatile 
building blocks widely distributed in a vast array of biologically active compounds, such as a nti-
tumour agents, (Nakaike et al. 1992 ; Bolognese et al. 2002 ; Corona et al. 2009 ) antibiotics and 
antibacterial agen ts, (McDonald et al. 1999 ; Zeis et al. 1987 ; Borrero et al. 2014 ) agrochemicals, 
(Starke et al. 2004 ) biosensors (Pauliukaite et al. 2010 ) and dyes and polymers. (Dailey et al. 
2001 ; Yamamoto et al. 1996 ; Yamamoto et al. 2003 ) Due to the importance and broad field of 
applications of the aforementioned molecules, the development of new enzymatic, greener 
methodologies, is crucial as alternative (bio)synthetic routes fo r the formation of these aromatic 
frameworks.  
Homocoupling reactions of para -substituted aromatic amines using CotA -laccase result in 
trimers with diaminated quinone -diimine structure s (Fig 7) (Sousa et al. 2013 ) at very good to 
excellent overall conversion yields. Additionally, the involvement of some of these amines as 
primary bases in cross -coupling reactio ns with different couplers  mediated by CotA -laccase 
(Sousa et al. 2016 ) resulted in the production of indo d yes, widely used in the permanent hair 
and leather coloration. (Corbett 1999 ; Morel and Christie 2011 ) The substrate´s reactivity is 
dependent on the nature and position of the substituents in the aniline ring (Sousa et al. 2013 ; 
Sousa et al. 2 016) and in general, laccase´s activity is enhanced by the presence of electron -
donating groups.  Additionally, t he efficiency of the CotA -laccase enzymatic system is strictly 
dependent on the difference of the redox p otential between the enzyme (0.55 V) (Durao et al. 
2008a ) and the substrates . The pH of reaction  is a paramount parameter since it affects both the 
catalytic activity of laccase and the redox potentials of the substrates i.e. their susceptibility for 
oxidation  is a critica l operational parameter  (Sousa et al. 2015 ). In the pathway proposed for the 
oxidation of substituted aromati c amines ( Fig 7),  the initial step is the  abstraction of an electron 
from aromatic amines, followed by deprotonation of the primary inter mediate (oxidation base) 
and formation of two short -lived intermediates (an aminium cation radical ( A·+), a neutral radical 
species ( A·), the aminyl radical) or  the formation of the benzoquinonediimine intermediate ( A) 
and the corresponding conjugated acid ( AH+). Therefore, starting from the intermediate species, 
by sequential self -conjugation ( path a ) or cross -coupling with different couplers ( paths b and 
c), the reaction proceeds through N -C coupling in the ring activated positions. Path a) forms a 
homomolecular dimeric structure which is subsequently transformed in the final 1,4 -substituted -
2,5-benzoquinonediimine trimer, while paths b) and c) yield dinuclear l euco dyes ( B) and result 
in the final indoaniline or aminoindamine dyes ( C) or the trinuclear indo dyes ( D). According to 
the proposed pathway the stability of the radicals, enhanced by the presence of electron donor 
substituents, seems to be of major impo rtance for th e laccase catalytic efficiency (Sousa et al. 
2013 ; Sousa et al. 2016 ). 15 
  
Figure 7. Proposed pathways for CotA -laccase mediated homocoupling reactions involved in the formation of 1,4 -substituted -
2,5-benzoquinonediimine trimers and heterocoupling reactions involving the primary intermed iates 1,4 –PDA or 2,5 -DAT and 
meta - or meta,para -substituted couplers (adapted from (Sousa et al. 2013 ; Sousa et al. 2016 )).   
The formation of different heterocyclic scaffolds, e.g. symmetric and asymmetric phenazines, 
phenoxazinones and carbazoles by oxidation of structurally different aromatic substrates assisted 
by CotA -laccase was also reported (Sousa et al. 2014 ; Sousa et al. 2015 ; Sousa et al. 2018 ) (see 
Fig. 8). The efficiency of the reactions leading to the formation of heterocoupl ed dinuclear or 
trinuclear dyes  was found strongly dependent on the presence of electron donor groups on the 
meta -substituted couplers. A mechanistic pathway for the synthesis of substit uted symmetric and 
asymmetric heterocycles with phenazine and phenoxazine frameworks was proposed ( Fig. 8) 
where an ortho -diamine or ortho -aminophenol is enzymatically oxidized  through two successive 
one-electron oxidations, generating ortho -quinone -diimine or ortho -quinone -imine 
intermediates ( A). Under the reaction conditions, these species suffer rapid nucleophilic addition 
by other substrate molecules in its most electrophili c carbon atom, followed by a proton shift, 
yielding the first coupling intermediate ( B). The second 2e- oxidation is enzymatic and an 
intramolecular Michael addition of an amino group (or phenol) to the C5 atom, with the 
displacement of a R group, leads to  an aminophenazine or fully reduced aminophenoxazine, 
which are spontaneously oxidised in air to produce the final heterocycle products. (Sousa et al. 
2014 ; Bruyneel et al. 2012 ) For the meta,para -disubstituted aromatic amines, the first step is the 
16 
 in-situ generation of an para -benzo quinonediimine intermediate ( A’) in a similar way as 
described above. This intermediate further reacts with the nucleophilic amino group of another 
molecule at the ortho -position, adjacent to the R 1 group leading to the formation of dimeric 
structures. This second step, followed by a proton loss, yields the first coupling intermediate ( B). 
This non -isolable product underwent a subsequent oxidation, probably mediated by laccase, 
followed by an intramo lecular Michael addition to form the symmetric substituted phenazines.  
 
Figure 8. Proposed pathways involved in the formation of symmetric and asymmetric phenazines and phenoxazines from 
substituted aromatic amines by CotA -laccase (adapted from (Sousa et al. 2014 , 2018 )).  
The (bio)synthesis  of azo dyes  biotransformation was  also reported  as minoritary products of 
laccase´s  aromatic amines oxidation  (Sousa et al. 2013 ; Sousa et al. 2014 , 2018 ) and as a product 
of degradation of the antraquinonic Acid Blue 62 dye (Pereira et al. 2009a ; Enaud et al. 2010 ). 
Recently, the enzymatic oxidation of aromatic amines was directed to the formation of azo dyes, 
by the choice of appropriate substrates a nd the use of ABTS as mediator  and several ortho  and 
para -substi tuted azo dyes  were formed  and the correspondent mechanistic pathway proposed 
(Sousa et al, 2019) . The variety of different aromatic scaffolds obtained by this enzymatic 
17 
 approach clearly show that laccase s are promising tool s for aromatic amines oxidation, boosting 
new eco-friendly alternatives to the production of value -added aromatic compounds.
