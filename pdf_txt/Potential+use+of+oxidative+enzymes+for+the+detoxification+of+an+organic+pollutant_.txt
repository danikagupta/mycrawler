Organic micropollutants  (OMPs ) are pervasive anthropogenic contaminants of  fresh and 16 
marine waters  with known potential to adversely affec t aquatic life (e.g.  endocrine disruption). 17 
Their ubiquitous environmental occurrence  is primarily attribute d to wastew ater treatment 18 
plant discharges  following their incomplete removal  by common biological treatment 19 
processes. This study assesse s a new strategy for promot ing the degradation of six model OMPs 20 
(i.e. sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, tylosin, atrazine, naprox en and ibuprofen) by 21 
stimulating  microbial oxidoreductase  production  to counter the effects of oxidative stress 22 
caused by oxygen perturbation . Microbial c ultures  from dairy farm wastewater were exposed 23 
to a cyclical  ON-OFF perturbations  of oxygen supply , ranging from 0.16 to 2 cycles per hour 24 
(i.e. 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.16 cycles/hour) , in laboratory bioreactors. The activity  and relative 25 
abundances  of microbial oxidoreductases (such as peroxidases, cytochrome s P450 ) were 26 
upregulated by oxygen perturbation. In comparison to c ontrols  subjected to constant oxygen 27 
levels, OMP concentrations in perturbed cultures decreased by 70±9% (mean ± SD) . A 28 
distance -based linear model confirmed  strong positive correlations between the relative 29 
abundance of the bacterial families , Rhodocyclaceae, Syntrophaceae  and 30 
Syntrophobacteraceae , and oxygen perturbations . Our results confirm that intentional 31 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Significance  46 
 47 
Oxygen concentration is a critical  control variable  for biological processes in conventional 48 
wastewater treatment systems . We provide a  simple  approach that could be used in existing 49 
wastewater treatment infrastructure  to enhance removals of  otherwise persistent OMPs by 50 
exploiting oxidative stress responses of  microbes. O ur study illustrates the ability  of fluctuating 51 
oxygen conditions  to affect  microbia l activity and polulation by upregulating oxidoreductases  52 
linked to  the removal of organic micropollutants . The incorporation of  inexpensive and easy to 53 
implement dissolved  oxygen supply strateg ies for more efficient OMPs  biotransformation  54 
provides a realistic approach to improving the treatment performance of  biological processes .  55

Introduction  57 
The discharge of trace levels of pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, pesticides and personal 58 
care product s into aquatic environment s is an issue of global  environmental concern  (1–3). 59 
Because of their  resistance  to conventional wastewater treatment  and environmental 60 
persistence  as complex mixtures , these organic micropollutants  (OMPs) present  risks of 61 
adverse ecological impact to  biota  via direct  toxicity  and endocrine disruption  (4–6). For 62 
example,  occurrence of the herbicide, atrazine , even at concentrations below  6 µg/L in 63 
receiving  waters , caused behavioural changes in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio , such as a 64 
preference for dark habitats and alterations in swimming due to failure of its nervous system 65 
(7). OMP exposure  effects may be additive ; for example  studies  by (8) and (9)  have reported 66

 that exposure of female Danio rerio  to pharmaceutical  mixtures of acetaminophen, 67 
carbamazepine, gemfibrozil and venlafaxine  significan tly reduce s fecundity , and 68 
disproportionate to effects expected for individual exposures . Such concerns about  the 69 
environmental occurrence  of OMPs  have triggered attempt s to enhance  their biodegradation 70 
during wastewater treatment (10). Although c onventional activated sludge methodologies  are 71 
not specifically optimi sed to eliminate OMPs  (11), exploi ting the diverse enzymatic potential 72 
of microbial consortia h as been identified as a critical  pathway  for OMP removal (12–14).  73 
 74 
In the period since the  first oxidative conditions arose on Earth  due to  early photosynthesis, 75 
microbes have  evolved to survive exposure to a variety of harmful oxidative  stresses  (15). For 76 
instance, oxidative stress generated by the  high concentration  of intracellular reactive oxygen 77 
species (ROS) including superoxide ( O2-), hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals  78 
(OH.), and ipso facto , induce s oxidative enzyme gene expression  (16) and consequent  synthesis 79 
of antioxidative enzymes such as peroxidases and oxidoreductases  to protect against such 80 
oxidative stress  (17, 18) . From a wastewater treatment perspective, intentional manipulations 81 
of environmental oxygen concentration s could stimulate the production of these enzymes , 82 
some of which are also capable of degrading toxic  substances including polycyclic aromatic 83 
hydrocarbons and organophosphorus contaminants (19–23). Ther efore, oxygen perturbations  84 
might pre-dispose  cells, through  transcriptional response s of their oxidoreductases to protec t 85 
against iterative oxidative stress , to enhanc e OMP degradation . This proposed mechanism 86 
implies that  simple  oxygen control strategies  within wastewater treatment bioreactors may 87 
provide  a cost-effective solution for enhanced biological OMP r emoval . 88 
In this study we investigate d the impact of dynamic variation in oxygen concentration on OMP 89 
biotransformation  by representative wastewater microbial consortia . We hypothesise that 90 
varying dissolved oxygen concentration can enhance the degradation of OMPs by inducing 91 
oxidative stress and forcing microbes  to produce oxidoreductases. Specifically, we assess ed 92 
the effect of varying frequency  of oxygen perturbation s on microbial consortia by monitoring 93 
the synthesis of oxidative biocatalysts (oxidoreductases)  along with the  removal of  OMP s.  94

 Results  96 
Influence of oxygen perturbations on microbial enzymatic activity  97 
Five frequencies (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.16 cycles per hour) were tested at two aeration regimes 98 
(high -DO, up to 10 mg - DO /L and low -DO, up to 4 mg - DO /L) that generated cyclic patterns 99 
of dissolved oxygen concentrations in bioreactors (Figure 1, Table 1).  The oxidoreductase 100 
(lignin peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, laccase and cytochrome P450) and hydrolase (beta - 101 
glucosaminidase, beta -glucosidase) activities in bioreactors were detected 102 
spectrophotometrically by the oxidation of their respective chromogen ic substrates (Methylene 103 
Blue  [MB] , Azure B  [AB] , 3,4-Dihydroxy -L-phenylalanine  [L-DOPA] , 2,2’ -Azino -bis-(3- 104 
ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonic acid) [ABTS],  Sudan Orange G  [SO] , 4-nitrophenyl - 105 
dodecanoate  [pNP -12], Indole and 4 -Aminoantipyrine  [4-AAP] , 4-nitrop henyl N -acetyl -β-D- 106 
glucosaminide  [pNP -A] and  4-nitrophenyl - β-D-glucopyranoside  [pNP-G] (Table S1).  107 
Cultures perturbed in high -DO regimes at 0.25 cycles/hr showed significantly higher 108 
(ANOVA, p < 0.05) beta -glucosidase (pNP -G), lignin peroxidase (AB, MB) a nd horseradish 109 
peroxidase (ABTS) activity compared to cultures treated at 1 (lignin peroxidase (AB, MB), 110 
beta-glucosidase  (pNP -G) and cytochrome P450 (Indole)) or 2 (lignin peroxidase (AB, MB) 111 
only) cycles/hr. The cultures exposed to 0.25 and 0.5 cycles/h r and maintained within a low - 112 
DO range showed high (ANOVA, p < 0.05) cytochrome P450 (Indole, 4 -AAP), lignin 113 
peroxidase (AB, MB), and horseradish peroxidase (L -DOPA, ABTS) activity whereas 0.16 114 
cycles/hr subjected cultures exhibited more beta -glucosaminida se (pNP -A), beta -glucosidase 115 
(pNP -G), lignin peroxidase (MB, AB) and horseradish peroxidase (L -DOPA, ABTS) activity 116 
(Figure 2a).  117 
 118 
By contrast, under  constant non -perturbed oxygen concentrations, the high -DO aerobic 119 
cultures exhibit ed greater (ANOVA, p < 0 .05) cytochrome P450 (pNP -12), beta - 120 
glucosaminidase (pNP -A), beta -glucosidase (pNP -G),  lignin peroxidase (AB) and horseradish 121 
peroxidase (L -DOPA) activity, while the low -DO aerobic samples showed greater laccase 122 
(SO), beta -glucosaminidase (pNP -A), lignin peroxidase (MB) and horseradish peroxidase 123 
(ABTS, L -DOPA) activity. Proteomic analysis supported the  above  enzyme activity profile s 124 
with significant (95% confidence interval) observations showing that maximum relative 125 
abundance of expressed oxidoreductases (cytochromes, peroxidases and oxidases) had 126 
occurred in perturbed low -DO cultures (0.5 and 0.25 cycles/hr) (Figure 2b).   127

 Micropollutant removal by mixed cultures  129 
The removal of OMPs (at 0.1 mg/L initial nominal concentrations) was significantly (ANOVA, 130 
p < 0.05 ) increased  by the perturbed DO conditions  (remov ing OMPs  below the limit of 131 
quantification (LOQ)) . The perturbed treatments showed 70±9% (mean ± SD) removal of 132 
sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, tylosin, atrazine, naproxen and ibuprofen, with an average 133 
residual concentration of 0.04 mg/L for individual OMPs  remaining  at the end of the 134 
experiments. Cultures exposed to 0.5 cycles/hr in the low -DO regime exhibited near log - 135 
removal (~ 0.01-0.02 mg/L residual concentration s) of sulfamethoxazole, naproxen and 136 
ibuprofen, whereas carbamazepine, tylosin and atrazine concentrations in the cultures 137 
subjected to 0.16 and 0.25 cycles/hr in low -DO range w ere attenuated  to residuals of  0.012 - 138 
0.04 mg/L (Figure 3). Cultures under constant low -DO conditions showed 35±8% removal of 139 
all compounds compared to constant high -DO treated cultures with 25±6% removal. On 140 
average, 0.06 mg/L residual concentrations of OMPs were detect ed in constant low -DO 141 
cultures while constant high -DO cultures exhibited 0.08 mg/L residual concentration (Figure 142 
3). There were no significant differences ( post-hoc Tukey test, p > 0.05) for sulfamethoxazole, 143 
carbamazepine and tylosin between DO perturbed  and non -perturbed constant high and low - 144 
DO aerobic cultures. However, a significant removal (post -hoc Tukey test, p < 0.05) of 145 
atrazine, naproxen and ibuprofen can be seen under low -DO aerobic perturbed cultures 146 
compared to high -DO aerobic and non -perturb ed constant cultures. Autoclaved biomass, used 147 
as a negative control, showed a loss of 15±6% for all OMPs (data not shown) which is attributed 148 
to abiotic factors such as hydrophobic partitioning and sorption  to the sludge  solids . Figure S1 149 
and Table s S2 and S3 in the s upplementary information show  OMP removal, OMP residual 150 
concentrations and quality control measures, respectively.  151 
 152 
Influence of oxidative stress on microbial speciation  153 
A total of 527 operational taxonomic units ( 97% OTUs)  were identified  in the cultures , of 154 
which 513 represented Bacteri a and 13 were Archaea.  The percentage  occurrence of bacteria 155 
belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria , which are linked to  the biotransformation  of 156 
recalcitrant c ontaminants  in wastewaters  (24), predominates and correlated  with respect to 157 
ecological variables like process operations (changing oxygen conditions), influent wastewater 158 
characteristics or geographical location (25). Comamonadaceae  (40%) was the dominant 159 
family in cultures perturbed with 0.25 cycles/hr in high -DO regime while a higher abundance 160 
of Methylophilaceae  (25%) was found in 1 and 2 cycles/hr treated cultures at high -DO range  161 
(Figure S2 in the supplementary inf ormation ). Cultures exposed to 0.16 cycles/hr in low -DO 162 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 regime showed a higher abundance of Rhodocyclaceae  (15%).  Flavobacteriaceae  (10-12%) 163 
and Pseudomonadaceae  (14%) were dominant in cultures perturbed with 0.25 and 0.5 cycles/hr 164 
at low -DO regime. The no n-perturbed constant high and low -DO regime subjected cultures 165 
resulted in higher abundances (30-45%) for Comamonadacea e. dbRDA constrained ordination 166 
based on Bray -Curtis similarity was conducted to determine the extent to which bacterial 167 
community variation at family level can be explained by DO conditions (Figure 4). A linear 168 
relationship was confirmed between dependent va riables (bacterial families, enzyme activity 169 
and residual OMP concentration) and changes in predictor variable (perturbed and non - 170 
perturbed DO conditions ). The most important parameters contributing variation in bacterial 171 
community composition, assessed at  the level of family was  the presence of the bacterial 172 
families Rhodocyclaceae, Syntrophaceae , Syntrophobacteraceae  Sphingobacteriaceae , 173 
Xanthomonadaceae, Campylobacteriacea and Aeromonadaceae , as well as laccas e, lignin, 174 
horseradish peroxidase  and cytochrome P450 activity, and OMPs (namely  sulfamethoxazole, 175 
carbamazepine, naproxen and ibuprofen ; Figure 4). PERMANOVA indicating  the similarities 176 
and differences between the different DO treatments in terms of bacterial composition, enzyme 177 
activity  and OMP removal efficiencies showed significant difference ( F = 3.26; df = 10, 11; p 178 
= 0.001) between perturbed and non -perturbed cultures. Variation in bacterial community  179 
composition  positively correlated with microbial enzyme activity ( relate analysis, R = 0.46, p  180 
< 0.05 ) and OMP residuals  (relate analysis, R = 0.54, p < 0.05 ).  181

Discussion  183 
Microbial Community Composition  184 
Biological  processes  in waste treatment are manipulat ed by changing  operati on conditions  (26) 185 
to promot e specific eco -physiological  characteristics of the microbial community  to achieve 186 
the desired outcomes  (25). Previously, the occurrence and abundance  of Proteobacteria phyla 187 
has been linked to  fluctuating concentrations of DO (27) and the effective biotransform ation 188 
of pharmaceuticals (28). In the present study, perturbations of DO conditions have translated 189 
to relative differences in the microbial community compositio n. The core set of bacteria l 190 
families  included were  Commamonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Rhodocyclaceae, 191 
Sphingobacteriaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Burkholderiaceae and Pseudomonadaceae , 192 
identified previously as major co ntributors to  activated sludge treatment with in wastewater 193 
treatment plants (WWTP)  worldwide (29, 30) . Genomic analysis has revealed that many 194 
common wastewater microorganisms have considerable potential to produce specialised 195 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 enzymes and metabolites with OMP degradation potential (31–34). The core bacterial families 196 
observed in our study from the phylum Proteobacteria have been reported as organic 197 
micropollutant degraders in WWTPs treating pharmaceutical, petroleum refinery, domes tic 198 
and agricultural wastewater (24). Commamonadaceae represented  ~40% of the bacteria in both 199 
perturbed (0.25 cycles/hr, high -DO) and non -perturbed constant high -DO aeration regime s, 200 
followed by Rhodocyclaceae and Syntropahceae (15%) in 0.16 cycles/hr, low -DO perturbed 201 
conditions . The se families  can degrade  aromatic compounds and  denitrif y industrial 202 
wastewaters (35). Syntropahceae dominated  the anaerobic condition s within the  0.16 cycles/hr  203 
perturbed DO regime , consistent with other observations  (36). However, Flavobacteriaceae,  204 
Pseudomonadaceae  and Sphingomonadaceae  (10-14%) families evident in 0.25  and 0.5 205 
cycles/hr perturbed cultures at low -DO regime were identified as the core bacteria in activated 206 
sludge systems with floc -formation capabilities (37) and capable of co-metaboli c 207 
biotransformation of ibuprofen (38), carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole (39, 40) . We found 208 
a significant correlation between microbial communities , enzyme activity , and OMP residual 209 
concentrations under  different DO treated cultures. The bioremediation  potential of laccases 210 
produced by Pseudomonadaceae  and Xanthomonadaceae  was successfully demonstrated  (41). 211 
The cytochrome P450 system expressed in Rhodococcus  spp. is known to degrade a range of 212 
wastewater -derived steroid  hormone s and toxic herbicides (42).  213 
 214 
Enzyme activity  215 
Microbial enzymes are promising biocatalysts for OMP degradation (43); however, controlling 216 
the synthesis of poorly  characterized enzymes to specifically enhance OMP  treatment in 217 
complex wastewater communities has not been achieved.  Oxygen is an obvious candidate for 218 
directed biocatalyst synthesis because it has a pronounced impact on the physiology and 219 
metabolism of microorganisms , including the induction of oxidoreductases demonstrat ed to 220 
degrade OMPs in pure enzyme assays. In this study, we found that cycling  between aerobic 221 
and anaerobic phases stimulate d the constant prod uction of oxidoreductases (peroxidases, 222 
cytochromes and laccases)  and native activated sludge enzymes such as hydrolases (beta - 223 
glucosidase and beta -glucosaminidase) . The bacterial response to changing environmental 224 
oxygen was previously demonstrated by the  activation of global regulatory systems – Arc BA, 225 
Fnr, OxyR and Sox RS (Figure 5) (44). The expression of peroxidases  and cytochrome P450 226 
in our study was approximately  1-2 orders of magnitude higher in the cultures perturbed with 227 
0.25 and 0.5 cycles/hr at low -DO regime compared to 0.25 and 1 or 2 cycles/hr at high -DO 228 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 regime  treated cultures .  Thus,  exposing microbes to fluctuating aerobic -anaerobic phases 229 
induces the cellular enzymatic machinery to ac tivate genetic adaptive strategies (e .g. SoxRS  230 
and OxyR  mediated oxidative stress response systems) . Gene activation leads to  the synthesis 231 
of scavenging oxidoreductases , which  provid e a feedback control  to lower  the intracellular 232 
ROS concentrations ( 16, 45) (Figure 5) . Increasing oxygen concentration s seem to result in the 233 
accumulation of significant amounts of intracellular ROS which overwhelm the cell with 234 
additional  peroxidase expression. Increased level s of t hese enzymes are unable to completely 235 
counterbalance the toxic action of free oxygen radicals  (46). However,  with decreasing oxygen 236 
concentration s, anti-oxidative genes may remain induced and produce more active and efficient 237 
oxidoreductases (peroxidases and cytochromes)  (47). The synthesis of beta -glucosidase is 238 
consistent  with their involvement  in organic matter degradation (48). Switch ing between 239 
aerobic and anaero bic conditions also yields  bacterial metabolic reprogramming by regulating 240 
the activation of  one component Fnr oxygen sensor  and the two -component Arc system at  the 241 
transcriptional level (44). The Fnr and Arc A systems exhibit maximal activity  under 242 
microaerobic and anaerobic conditions  (oxygen concentration ≤ 2.5% of total gaseous volume) 243 
leading to the mediation of metabolic responses , amplifi ed production of redox  signals , and  244 
more endogenous ROS generation  (44, 49 –51) (Figure 5). The regulation and expression of the 245 
oxidative genes by these regulatory systems allows a sensitive but robust transcriptional 246 
response over a wide range of oxygen concentrations.  Proteomic analysis supported the 247 
correlation between maximum synthesis of cytochromes and peroxidases in the perturbed low - 248 
DO regime cultures. The synthesised oxido -reductases can simultaneously consume ROS as a 249 
cellular defence mechanism whi le oxidizing  OMP s (52, 53) . More studies would be needed to 250 
determine how ROS at cellular concentrations activates the expression of anti -oxidative genes 251 
and synthesis of oxidoreductases linked to the  catalysis of OMPs.  252 
Organic micropollutant removal  253 
The efficiency of OMP biotransformation  is linked to  environmental conditions that enhance 254 
the expression of oxidoreductases by microbes (54). Such outcomes are consistent with results 255 
of this study where enhanced  oxidoreductase production and OMP removal was observed in 256 
DO perturbed cultures compared to non -perturbed controls and autoclaved biomass.  Similarly, 257 
sequential induction of  aerobic  and anaerobic conditions during  biological wastewater 258 
treatment can enhance OMP biotransformatio n (55). Sludge cultures exposed to perturbations 259 
(0.16, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 cycles/hr) in both low and high -DO regime sh owed more OMPs 260

 These data indicate  that synthesis of highly active and efficient oxidoreductases (cytochrome 262 
P450, lignin and horseradish peroxidase) and hydrolases (beta -glucosidase) as a result of  263 
induced oxidative stress  is a mechanism to exploit for OMP attenuation  (56). Changi ng the 264 
oxygen conditions can influence the redox potential of the cell, hence, result ing in endogenous 265 
ROS production. As previously described, the oxygen free radicals can act as co -substrates for 266 
the synthesis of oxidoreductases (peroxidases, laccases an d cytochromes) while fortuitously 267 
oxidising nearby  organic substrates  (53, 56) . For example, the synthesis ed lignin peroxidases 268 
are high redox peroxidases which use  activated molecular oxygen (such as superoxides and 269 
hydrogen peroxides) for the hydroxylation and cleavage  of aromatic rings  (57–59). We suggest 270 
that non-specific oxidoreductases such as peroxidases, cytochrome P450 and laccases in the 271 
DO perturbed cultures  are metabolis ing OMPs in the presence of energy molecules (NADH or 272 
NAD+) produced during cell ular metabolism operated by different oxygen regulatory systems  273 
(53).  274 
The capability  of synthesised oxidoreductases for OMP  biotransformation across  different 275 
functional groups including carboxylic compounds (NPX and IBP), hydroxyl compounds (TT) 276 
and other functional groups (SMX, CBZ and ATZ) is demonstrated by their transformation  in 277 
the DO perturbed cultures  (53, 60, 61) . The active haem and copper centres of peroxidases and 278 
laccases and their reactivity with the evaluated OMPs ( having relatively small size s being 279 
comprised of  1-2 benzene rings) explains  their significant bio transform ation. The lower OMP 280 
removal efficiency of non -perturbed cultures is consistent with  the generation of excess 281 
endogenous ROS, which  partially inactivates  peroxidases and allows for  spontaneous 282 
conver sion back into the resting enzyme  (59). To improve the biodegradability of otherwise 283 
recalcitrant pharmaceuticals , personal care products  and other micropollutants , the key step is 284 
to induce microorganism s to produce degrada tive enzyme s. The efficient biodegradation of 285 
acetaminophen, acetyl sulfamethoxazole, atenolol and naproxen  by oxidoreductases  has been 286 
reported  (39, 62) , and  48-99% enzymatic transformation  of carbamazepine , a highly 287 
recalcitrant molecule,  by cytochrome P450 was demonstrated  (63). The easy implementation, 288 
cost-effectiveness a nd potential to degrade a wide range of OMPs and other pollutants of 289 
concern suggests that this mechanism should be further investigated and explo ited for its 290 
treatment potential.  291

efficiencies  for problematic organic contaminants  (14). With a potential to  catalyse OMP  298 
biotransformation s, the use of induced oxidoreductases in wastewater treatment has just started 299 
to be investigated at the laboratory scale (64). In future , the biodegradation of OMPs may be 300 
achieved by improving the performance of existing wastewater treatment systems under 301 
conditions th at provide  directed environmental stresses that result in over-production of 302 
beneficial OMP -degrading biocatalysts.  303

Reactor operational parameters and sampling  307 
Fed-batch experiments were performed with mixed liquor sludge from an oxidation pond near 308 
the stables and milking areas o f a dairy farm  in Alfriston, New Zealand . Sludge was diluted to 309 
3 g/L volatile suspended solids (VSS) with  distilled water to a total volume of 1L. The 310 
bioreact ors were continuously fed with ten times concentrated 100 ml synthetic wastewater 311 
(400 mg/L of COD as acetate and 60 mg -N/L ammonium as a nitrogen source) , also  containing 312 
0.1 mg/L each of six model OMP s (detailed in the supplementary information)  provided at a 313 
constant feed rate of 0.034 mL/min. for 48 hours. Oxidative stress was imposed on cultures by 314 
iteratively exposing them to ON -OFF cycles of an oxygen enriched air supply during the 315 
cultivation per iod. Additionally, consta nt (non -perturbed) high and low -DO conditions and 316 
autoclaved (dead) biomass were tested as controls. Each condition was tested in duplicate  with 317 
sampling at the end of the cycle . 318 
Enzymes activity assays  319 
The activity of oxidoreductases in culture biomass samples was determined 320 
spectrophotometrically by measuring the degradation (oxidation and hydrolysis) of  various 321 
chromogenic substrates used as surrogate xenobiotic s (Table S 1 in the supplementary 322 
information) . In brief, 20 ml aliquots of microbial culture samples were centrifuged at 18,078 323 
x g for 15 min. at -4˚C in 50 ml falcon tubes. The pellets from each tube were resuspended in 324 
either 10 ml acetate buffer or 10 ml phosphate buffer  (detailed  in supporting inf ormation) . Each 325 
well of a 96 well microplate was filled with 100  µl aliquots of the respective buffers, 100  µl 326 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 chromogenic dye and 100  µl resuspended biomass. Dyes and samples resuspended in double 327 
the amount of buffer served as controls . The prepared plat es were mixed and incubated at 30˚C  328 
for 1 hour.  To start reaction s of the sample enzymes with assay dyes, 10 µl of 0.3% H2O2 at 329 
30% was added to the M ethylene Blue, Azure B, L -DOPA and ABTS dye wells and 10 µl of 330 
1M NaOH added to the para-nitrophenol dye wells  (to stop the reaction)  and vortex mixed. 331 
Changes in absorbance caused by chromogenic reactions were read on a Victor X3 Multimode 332 
Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, USA)  at different wavelengths  (refer to supporting information) . 333 
Protein extraction and identification  334 
Protein extraction was performed by cell lysis followed by precipitation of proteins and 335 
separation of low and high stringency protein fractions by 1D SDS PAGE. Briefly, 30 ml of 336 
sludge sample was pelleted and washed with 50 ml of 0.9% sodiu m chloride and spun down at 337 
20,200 xg for 20 min at -4°C. The  pellet was then washed  again in 40 ml Tris -HCl (pH -7) and 338 
centrifuged at 20,2 00 xg for 20 min at -4°C to get the final pellet , which was resuspended in 339 
sample buffer , pulse -vortexed and, then placed on ice for 2 h with regular m ixing at 15 min 340 
intervals. S amples were sonicated for 15 s (six  rounds on ice) and centrifuged at 20,2 00 xg for 341 
3 min at 4°C. The supernatant was mixed with trichloroacetic acid  (100% w/v)  and centrifuged 342 
at 23 ,400 xg for 30 min at -4°C after which t he pellet was washed with 5 ml cold acetone twice. 343 
The final pellet was heat dried and re -suspended in 400 µl  low stringency buffer  (see 344 
supplementary information) to generate a low stringency f raction  (LSF) in the s upernatant , 345 
followed by centrifugation,  then extracting this  pellet in 400 µl high stringency buffer to 346 
generate a high stringency f raction  (HSF). Proteins in both  fractions were quantified 347 
spectrophotometrically  by fluorescence . Crude separation of LSF and HSF proteins was 348 
achieved using 1D SDS PAGE. Individual bands were excised with  a sharp razor blade and 349 
placed into  low-binding, siliconized microcentrifuge tube s for destaining reduction, alkylation 350 
and trypsinolysis. Finally,  5 µL o f the generated tryptic peptides of the microbial proteins were 351 
injected on to a SCIEX 6600 triple TOF mass spectrometer. Protein identification was carried 352 
out by comparing the obtained peptide sequences against those of the UniProt database. 353

Extraction and analysis of o rganic micropollutants (OMPs)  356 
OMPs at 0.1 mg each per L were prepared from a 1 g each per L stock solution in methanol 357 
and fed continuously at a feed rate of 0.034 mL/min to the bioreactor cultures for 48  h. Residual 358

 cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) following the method described by  (65). Briefly , 200 360 
mL of aqueous sludge culture was co llected at the end of the cultivation cycle and centrifuged 361 
to remove suspended particles (20,4 000 xg for 20 min at -4°C). The supernatant w as passed 362 
through the cartridges (pre -conditioned with 5 mL each of tert-methyl butyl ether, methanol 363 
(Merck; laboratory grade purity) and deionised water) and washed with water. The OMPs were 364 
extracted in  methanol (10 mL) under a vacuum system.  365 
OMP analysis was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectro metry (LC - 366 
MS) using a Shimadzu 2020 Series LC -MS (Shimadzu, Japan) with an Agilent ZORBAX 367 
Eclipse Plus C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, particle size 1.8 µm, Agilent Technologies, 368 
Germany) following  EPA Method 1694  (66). A binary gradient system of mobile phase A, 369 
0.1% formic acid in deioni sed water, and mobile phase B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile w ere 370 
used to separate analyte s in positive ESI mode , while 5  mM ammonium acetate, pH -5.5 (mobile 371 
phase A) and methanol (mob ile phase B) w ere used for analysis in negative ESI mode. The 372 
solvent gradient program me for positive ESI mode was as follows: 10% B to 60% B in 24 min 373 
and then maintain ed at 100% B for 30 min . For negative ESI mode, the gradient started with 374 
40% B, and was increased linearly to 100% B over 13.5 min, and then maintained at 40% B 375 
for 17 min . The flow rate was 0.2  ml/min. in both modes and the injection volume was set to 2  376 
µl and 10  µl for +/- polarity modes , respectively . Limit of detection and limit of qu antification 377 
were determined using signal/noise ratios of 3 and 10 respectively . 378 
Microbial DNA isolation and bacterial species identification  379 
A PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, USA) was used for the isolation of bacterial 380 
total genomic DNA extracted from sludge samples (1 mL) following the manufacturer’s 381 
protocol. Bacterial community composition was characterised by amplifying and sequencing 382 
bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gen e fragments with the universal 16S PCR forward 383 
primer (5'- 384 
TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG -3') 385 
and 16S PCR reverse primer  (5'- 386 
GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG GACTACHVGGGTATCTAA 387 
TCC -3') following a standard protocol  (67); nucleotide bases in bold are Illumina overhang 388 
adapter sequences for high throughput sequencing. Amplified PCR products were purified 389 
using an AMPure XP beads kit (Beckman Coulter Inc.) and concentrations recorded using a 390 
Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 391 
and then sequenced using an  Illumina MiSeq machine. The resulting paired -end read DNA 392 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 sequence data were merged and quality filtered using the USEARCH sequence analysis tool 393 
(68). Data were dereplicated so that only one copy of each sequence was reported . Sequence 394 
data were then checked for chimeric sequences and clustered into groups of operational 395 
taxonomic units based on a seq uence identity threshold equal to or greater than 97% (thereafter 396 
referred to as 97% OTUs) using the clustering pipeline UPARSE (68) in QIIME v.1.6.0 , as 397 
described in  Bates et al.  (69). Prokaryote phylotypes were classified to their corresponding 398 
taxonomy by implementing the RDP classifier routine  (70) in QIIME v. 1.6.0 (71) to 399 
interrogate the Greengenes  13˙8 database (72). All sequences of chloroplast and mitochondrial 400 
DNA were removed. Finally, DNA sequence data were rarefied to a depth of 5,600 randomly 401 
selected reads per sample and two samples per treatment  to achieve a standard number of 402 
sequencing reads across all samples.  403 
 404 
Statistical analyse s 405 
Enzyme activities were plotted using the heat map function within the R package ‘gplots’. 406 
Similarities in bacterial community composition, enzyme activity and OMP remaining in 407 
cultures were investigated using multivariate statistical analyses. Bray -Curtis d istance matrices 408 
of relative bacterial abundance, enzyme synthesis and OMP residual concentrations were 409 
calculated and significant differences across  all sample groups assessed using permutational 410 
multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA).  The RELATE f unction within the 411 
PRIMER package was used to calculate the Spearman rank correlation between data matrices 412 
constructed from the bacterial community, enzyme activity and OMP residual concentrations.  413 
All multivariate statistical analyses were performed in P RIMER 6 (Plymouth Marine 414 
Laboratory). Significant differences in OMP removal and r esidual  concentrations were 415 
calculated by GraphPad Prism 7  using one -way ANOVA and post -hoc Tukey tests . 416

Figure 5.  Regulation of enzyme production by the competition of ROS production and cellular respiration for O 2. Under aerobiosis, NADH 
generated by carbon oxidation is oxidised to NAD+ and the electrons are passed on to oxygen by quinone pool (Q -pool). The 
autophosphorylation of membrane integrated Arc B is inhibited by oxidised quinone. Microaerobiosis/ Anaerobiosis causes a dec rease in the 
level of oxidised quinones due to more produc tion of NADH, allowing the transphosphorylation of Arc A -P. Arc A -P then coordinates the 
cellular response to microaerobiosis. Fnr is a direct sensor of oxygen availability. It is in a monomeric activated state wit h the incorporation 
of (4Fe -4S)2+ cluster.  Under aerobic conditions, the active Fnr (4Fe -4S)2+ cluster gets converted to inactive (2Fe -2S)2+, thus, inhibiting the 
gene regulation while microaerobic/ anaerobic conditions block the Fnr at active (4Fe -4S)2+ form. Both Fnr and Arc AB regulates the cel l 
metabolic pathways to generate redox signals which transfers electrons to the oxygen and generates the reactive oxygen specie s inside the cell. 
Another oxidative stress regulator (Sox RS and Oxy R) regulates the endogenous free radical concentrations by synthesis of antioxidative 
enzymes which simultaneously oxidise the organic micropollutants.
