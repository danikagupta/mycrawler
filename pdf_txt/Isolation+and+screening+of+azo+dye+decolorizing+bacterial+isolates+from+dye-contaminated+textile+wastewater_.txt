Abstract: Textile industries are well -characterized for consuming large quantities of water, energy, and discharging high 
volumes of waste into public sewage treatment plants . The present study was carried out with the aim to isol ate and use bacteria 
for decolourization of textile effluents. Bacteria were isolated from wastewater sample collected in July, 2023 from one of t he 
textile industries in Kano, Nigeria. Twenty (20) different colonies of bacteria grown on nutrient agar were  tested for their 
ability to grow on wastewater agar prepared using textile wastewater as the only carbon source. However, only four (4) isolat es 
with identification codes; 3, 14, 18 and 20 were found to have the ability to grow on the wastewater agar and thus; were used 
for the treatment in the research. Consortium of all the isolates was also included in the treatment in order to determine th eir 
synergistic performance and the highest percentage color  removal was 85.83% achieved using consortium.  Physicoc hemical 
parameters such as pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and ammonical -nitrogen concentration 
of the textile wastewater sample were determined both before and after the treatments. The results revealed a significant 
decolo urization in the treatment samples incubated anaerobically without shaking. Therefore, the  bacteria strains isolated 
have potential applications for bioremediation of textile effluent and could be used in bioreactors to treat waste water stre ams.

INTRODUCTION  
Wastewater or effluents from the textile and other dye -stuff 
industries contain significant amounts of synthetic dyes 
that require treatment to pr event groundwater 
contamination [1]. The textile industry is a diverse sector 
in terms of production of raw materials, operating 
processes, product development, and equipment. Textile 
industries are well -characterized for consuming large 
quantities of wate r, energy, and discharging high volumes 
of waste in to public sewage treatment plants [2]. Reactive 
dyes, including many structurally different dyes, are 
extensively used in the textile industry because of their 
wide variety of color shades, high wet fastn ess profiles, 
ease of application, brilliant colors, and minimal energy 
consumption. The three most common groups are azo, 
anthraquinone and phthalocyanine dyes [3], most of which 
are toxic and carcinogenic [4]. The delivery of colour in the 
form of dyes o nto textile fibres is not an efficient process, 
as a result, most of the wastewater produced by the textile 
industry is coloured [2]. Discharge of these dyes into the 
environment causes serious damage, since they may 
significantly affect the photosynthetic  activity of 
hydrophytes by reducing light penetration and also they 
may be toxic to some aquatic organisms due to their 
breakdown products [5].  
Major characteristics of environmental concern that are 
associated with textile wastewater include residual dye s 
especially azo dyes , toxic organic compounds, pH, colour, 
large amount of suspended solids, high temperature and 
biochemical/chemical oxygen demand (BOD 5/COD)  [6]. 
Many dyes contain organic compounds with functional groups, such as carboxylic ( –COOH), amine ( –NH2), and 
azo ( –N=N –) groups, so treatment methods must be 
tailored to the chemistry of the dyes. The need for a cost -
effective process to remove the colour from wastewater 
produced by the textile industry has be en recognised. 
Alternative approaches to colour removal, utilising 
microbial biocatalysts to reduce the dyes that are present in 
the effluent offer potential advantages over physio -
chemical processes. Such systems are now the focus of 
recent research. The use of microbes and Membrane 
filtration processes such as nanofiltration reverse osmosis 
are promising technologies for an eco -friendly approach to 
treating textile effluent for reuse  since it consumes less 
water and energy. Researchers have revealed that organic 
materials in wastewater can be remove biologically by the 
action of microor ganisms especially bacteria [6]. 
Many azo dyes and their degradation intermediates are 
mutagenic and carcinogenic [7, 8] and contribute 
immensely to the mutagenic activity o f ground and surface 
waters that are polluted by textile effluents [9, 10]. For the 
degradation of dyes in coloured wastewater, the use of 
whole cells rather than isolated enzymes is advantageous, 
because costs associated with enzyme purification are 
negat ed and the cell can also offer protection from the 
harsh process environment to the enzymes [11].  Also, 
degradation is often carried out by a number of enzymes 
working sequentially [2].  
Textile wastewater being generated by textile industries 
contains high ly toxic compounds that pose serious 
environmental problem [12]. For the degradation of dyes      Vol. 7 Issue 11, November - 2023, Pages: 104 -113

 in coloured wastewater, the use of whole cells rather than 
isolated enzymes is advantageous, because costs associated 
with enzyme purification are negated and the cell can also 
offer protection from the harsh process environment to the 
enzymes. Also, degradation is often carried out by a 
number of enzymes working sequentially [2]. There are so 
many physicochemical tecniques for color removal from 
wastewater effluent s containing dyes [13, 14].  
Approaches in Biotechnology for bioremediation of 
polluted wastewaters are also receiving attention, but are 
not yet utilized by the industries because more concern has 
been given to aromatic amines production generated under 
anaerobic conditions [15]. Nevertheless, a lot of 
investigations have shown that anaerobic – aerobic 
treatment processes are very effective for complete colour 
removal of wastewater effluent and that should ultimately 
prove to be environment -friendly and cos t-effective 
alternative to chemical decomposition processes [16]. 
Moreover, decolourization and degradation can also 
detoxify the efﬂuents. Recent fundamental work has 
revealed the existence of a wide variety of microorganisms 
capable of decolourizing a wi de range of dyes [16].  
Wastewater effluent is mainly used as an inoculum to 
initiate biodegradation, and it shows that various microbes 
can decolorize azo dyes [7, 17, 18]. Accumulation of 
dyestuff and dye wastewater creates not only 
environmental pollutio n, but also medical and aesthetic 
problems. Most of the conventional methods used in the 
treatment are either ineffective or very expensive. For this 
reason, there is an urgent need for alternative approaches 
that are technically feasible and cost -effectiv e. Microbial 
and enzymatic decolorization and degradation of dyes have 
significant potential to address this problem due to their 
eco-friendly and inexpensive nature [16].  Further 
development of biotreatment processes will be enhanced 
by identification of the most effective microbes and ways 
to minimize the time required to process polluted 
wastewater effluents for decolourization during treatment. 
In research aimed at biotechnology for treatment of textile 
waste -water, the current study was conducted to is olate 
dye-decolorizing bacteria from textile wastewater and to 
utilize them in the treatment of real textile effluent.  
 
 
2.0 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
2.1 Materials  
Some of the materials used include: micropipette, pipette 
tip, test tubes, centrifuge tubes, cuvette, glass spreader, 
membrane filter, wire loop, Bunsen burner, ethanol 
sprayer, beaker, conical flask, Scott bottles, HACH tube, 
BOD glass bottles (300 -Ml),  petri dishes, universal bottles, 
measuring cylinder, nutrient agar, nutrient broth, 
wastewater sample, distilled water . Reagents for COD, 
BOD, and ammonical -nitrogen were also provided for use.  2.2 Isolation of Bacteria from the Textile 
Wastewater  
The samp le of wastewater was collected in July, 2023 from 
one of the textile industries in Kano, Nigeria and 
transported to the Environmental Laboratory and kept until 
it assumed room temperature. Serial dilutions of sample 
were prepared by transferring 1ml of the  sample into 9ml 
of sterile distilled water in a test tube to make 10-1 dilution, 
it was then serially diluted until 10-7. Nutrient agar plates 
were prepared and separately inoculated with 100µL 
aliquot from 10-4, 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7 respectively using 
spread plate technique. The procedure was duplicated to 
allow for incubation at two different temperatures. One set 
of the inoculated plates (1 from each of the four chosen 
dilutions) were incubated for 24 hours at 30°C and the 
other se t at 37°C. After 24 hours of incubation, the colonies 
grown were observed and their respective morphological 
appearance was recorded. Twenty separate colonies (five 
from each of the four positive N.A plates) were then 
assigned numbers and sub -cultured on b oth nutrient agar 
and wastewater agar (50% wastewater + 50% Dh 2O + agar) 
using streaking method. Both plates were then incubated at 
30°C and 37C for 2 days.  
2.2.1 Selection of decolouring bacteria  
After 2 days of incubation, the colonies that were able to 
grow on both nutrient agar and wastewater agar (positive 
results) were selected and sub -cultured into nutrient broth 
for multiplication of the bacteria to be used for the 
treatment. The selected colonies were also inoculated onto 
agar slant to keep the iso lates for subsequent 
used/identification. Both nutrient broth and slant agar were 
incubated for 24 hours at 30°C.  
 
2.3 Wastewater Treatment for Decolourization  
2.3.1  Preparation of broth culture for the Treatment  
The four bacteria isolates selected based on their ability to 
grow on both Nutrients agar and Wastewater agar  were 
separately inoculated into four different test tubes each 
containing about 30ml of sterile nutrient broth. The tubes 
were then incubated in the oven at 370C for 24hour in order 
to get  actively growing cells for the treatment.  
2.3.2  Treatment procedure  
The treatment of the textile wastewater was carried out 
under two different conditions (Aerobically with shaking 
and anaerobically without shaking). Six test tubes were 
used for each treatment condition. Initially, the wastewater 
was sterilised by autoclaving at 1210C for 15minutes and 
allowed to cool to room temperature after which about 
35ml was transferred to each of the test tubes labelled 
according to the isolate number (3, 14, 18  and 20) with the      Vol. 7 Issue 11, November - 2023, Pages: 104 -113

 fifth and sixth test tubes  labelled as consortium and 
negative control respectively for set A. Each of the first 
four test tubes (3, 14, 18 and 20) was then inoculated with 
1000µL of the respective broth culture of the isolates (3, 
14, 1 8 and 20), the fifth test tube (consortium) was 
inoculated 250 µL from all the four different broth culture, 
while the sixth test tube (negative control) was left 
uninoculated.  Another set (B) was prepared using the same 
procedure. Finally, set A tubes we re incubated aerobically 
at 370C with shaking at 150 rpm for 24hours to check for 
decolourization. Set B  were incubated at 300C without 
shaking for 24hours. After incubation, the tubes were 
observed for decolourization and samples were taken for 
colour det ermination and other physicochemical analysis.  
2.4 Characterization of the Textile Wastewater 
effluent  
Physicochemical parameters of the wastewater sample 
such as pH, colour, Total Suspended Solid (TSS), COD and 
Ammonical -nitrogen were determined both befo re and 
after the treatments.  
2.4.1  pH Measurement  
The pH was measured using digital pH meter (Delta 320) 
according to standard method. Initially, the pH meter was 
calibrated using standard pH solutions. Supernatant of the 
sample was used for the measuremen t after centrifugation 
at 4000rpm for 10 minutes. Electrode of the pH meter was 
rinsed with distilled water after every usage. Measurement 
was repeated after treatment procedure.  
2.4.2  Determination of Colour Intensity  
Colour intensity determination was do ne according 
HATCH reactor digestion method. The sample was 
initially centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10 minutes. 1:10 
dilution of the supernatant was prepared using phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.6). 100µl of the diluted supernatant was 
transferred into 1.5ml cuvette after which the optical 
density (OD) was measured using Spectrophotometer 
(HACH DR5000) at 620nm wave length. The final value 
of colour intensity was determined by multiplying ADMI 
value measured by the spectrophotometer and the dilution 
factor.  
2.4.3  Dete rmination of Total Suspended Solid  
To obtain an estimated total suspended solid (TSS), a well -
mixed sample was filtered through an inorganic filter. 
Nylon filter paper was initially dried in oven at 1050C for 
1 hour and allowed to cool in desiccator. The initial weight 
of the filter paper was measured and recorded as W1. The 
filter paper was then mounted unto the filtration apparatus 
after which 10ml of the textile wastewater was filtered 
using vacuum pump. After filtration, the filter paper was transferre d into the muffle furnace and dried at 1050C for 
24hours followed by cooling in desiccator for 20 -30 
minutes and then measurement of the final weight W2.

Where:  
    W2 = weight of filter + dried residue in mg, and  
    W1 = weight of filter in mg.  
 
2.4.4  Determination of Chemical Oxygen Demand 
(COD)  
The supernatant of the sample was used for COD 
measurement after centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10 minutes. 
1ml of each sample was transferred into COD tube; 1.75ml 
of silver sulphate solution was then added followed by 
0.75ml of dichromate reagent. The COD tu bes were heated 
at 150˚C for 2 hours using COD reactor (HACH DRB 200). 
After 2 hours, the tubes were allowed to cool down and 
then the COD level of each tube was measured using 
Spectrophotometer (HACH DR5000).  
 
2.4.5  Determination of Ammonical -Nitrogen  
Determination of ammonical -nitrogen concentration was 
achieved using HACH program 2400. 1:50 dilution was 
initially prepared by mixing 0.5 Ml of wastewater sample 
with 24.5Ml deionized water in a 50 Ml centrifuge tube. 
After that, 1ml of Nessler reagent, 3 d rops of mineral 
stabilizer and 3 drops dispersing agent (alcohol) were added 
and the miture shaken vigorously for 1 minute. The mixture 
was allowed to settle for 10 minutes to allow reaction to 
take place. After 5 minutes, the sample was poured into a 
samp le cell, and then transferred into the cell holder with a 
lid. Blank was prepared by adding all three reagents to 25Ml 
deionized water into another sample cell. Concentration of 
ammonical -nitrogen was measured by using Hach DR 4000 
Spectrophotometer. A yel low colour would appear if 
ammonical -nitrogen was present in the sample.  
3.0 RESULTS  
3.1 Bacterial isolation  
For bacteria isolation, after 24 hours incubation, only plates 
inoculated with 10-4 and 10-5 dilutions showed positive 
growth (Table 1). The morph ological features of the 
colonies on nutrient agar differ only slightly from white to 
milky coloured and they are mostly circular with smooth 
edges.

3.2 Selection of bacteria for the treatment  
Out of the twenty colonies (numbered 1 -20) tested on 
the wastewater agar, only four (i.e. 3, 14, 18 and 20)   
were able to grow after 24hour of incubation. These 
isolates were considered as potential isolates for the  
treatment. Table 2 shows the results of selection.

conditions (incubated  at 30 °C without shaking), 
revealed positive result for treatment process. The 
color of the sterile wastewater sample apparently 
disappeared in all the test tube including consortium  
  
except for the negative control as shown in figure 1. 
For set A which was provided by aerobic condition

The Initial pH of the sample before the treatment was 
9.51. After the treatment, a significant reduction in pH 
was observed in all the test samples. The highest % 
reduction in pH was observed in a treatment tube 
inoculated with isolate code number 3 as shown in 
table 5 (set -B). For ammonical nitrogen concentration, 
the initial value has revealed 7mg/L of the effluent 
sample. After treatment, the highest reduction value was obtained with c onsortium  which is 111mg/L as 
shown in table 5 (set -B). The TSS and  COD  of the 
sample before the treatments were found to be 
0.63mg/L  and 6140mg/L . After the treatments, their 
measurements were also reduced significantly as 
compared with the initial values (table 5).  The highest  
reduction  value  for TSS was obtained  with isolate  
code  20 (set-B) which  is 0.10mg/L,  and the highest  % 
reduction  in COD  obtained  was obtained  was 80.62%.

4.0 DISCUSSION  
Isolation of decolourizing bacteria and their utilization 
in the treatment of textile wastewater was the focus of 
this project, the results obtained have revealed the 
presence of four bacteria isolates designated (3, 14,18 
and 20) that are capable of decolourizing textile waste 
effluent. Although, these isolates were not the only 
bacteria presence in the textile wastewater sample, the 
result of selection indicated that they have high 
potentiality to decolourize textile  wastewater due to 
their ability to grow on the wastewater agar. This result 
is in agreement with previous researches in which few 
isolates from a large number showed higher 
performance in decolourization of textile waste. For 
instance, Mahmood et al., [19] isolated up to 200 bacteria out of which only five were found to have the 
decolourizing ability.  
Relative performance of the isolated bacteria for the 
decolorization of textile wastewater clearly implies 
that these bacteria can be effectively used for th e 
removal of dye from contaminated industrial 
wastewater. Consortium of the bacteria showed a 
better performance in the treatment and significant 
decrease in colour up to 85.35%. This could probably 
be due to synergistic action of the different isolates 
involved. Colour in wastewater is due to the presence 
of azo dyes, most literature on the decolourization of 
azo dyes reveals that it occur under facultative 
anaerobic condition [20]. Azoreductase is reported to 
be the key enzyme expressed in azo -dye-degradi ng 
bacteria and catalyses the reductive cleavage of the azo 
     Vol. 7 Issue 11, November - 2023, Pages: 104 -113  
  2 
2 
 bond [21]. Azoreductase activity had been identified 
in several species of bacteria recently, such as 
Staphylococcus aureus , Shewanella putrefaciens, 
Shewanella strain J18 143 and Pseudomonas spp. [21, 
22, 23].  
Reduction of azo dye is non -specific, it can be 
enzymatic with the vital enzyme identified as 
azoreductase or by low molecular weight redox 
mediators.  Only few aerobic bacteria are able to 
utilize azo dyes as growth substrate [18]. Under 
facultative anaerobic condition, the dyes are reduced 
producing colourless solution containing aromatic 
amines. In the presence of oxygen, decolourization 
may not be achieved due to the competition between 
azo dye and oxygen for reduced electron carriers, 
oxygen may dominate the utilisation of NADH there 
by hindering the electron transfer to the azo dyes [20].  
In this project Set B which was subjected to facultative 
anaerobic conditions (incubated  at 30 °C without 
shaking), achieved higher positive results for 
treatment process. Comparing with the negative 
control (original wastewater), colour of wastewater 
disappeared in all other test tubes as Shown in figure 
1. While set A in which the treatment was done under 
aerobic condition (kept at 37°C with shaking) did not 
show significant colour change. Thus, major 
decolourization activity could be attributed to 
facultative anaerobic bacteria.  
Changes observed in the physicochemical parameters 
such as pH, TSS, COD  and ammonical nitrogen could 
be attributed to the metabolic activity of the bacteria 
used in the treatment. In this study, the bacteria slowly 
reduce colour during the aerobic phase of growth, 
however, higher colour removal was achieved during 
the faculta tive anaerobic phase of treatment during 
which % of colour removal was achieved; the increase 
in colour removal may be due to the absence of oxygen 
which may have slow down the decolourisation 
process.  
 
5.0 CONCLUSION  
It can be concluded that the sample of textile waste -
water used in this research harbours indigenous 
bacteria that could be isolated and used as agents for 
bioremediation of textile waste -water. Also the four 
bacteria isolates used in the treatment process  have the 
ability of decolorizing textile effluent. Furthermore, 
certain analytical methods such as spectroscopic 
measurement of colour intensity were used to measure 
the decolourization in the treatment process. Finally, 
our experimental results suggest t hat these bacteria 
strains isolated, have potential applications for 
bioremediation of textile effluent or dye -polluted waters and could be used in bioreactors to treat waste 
water streams.  
FUTURE WORK  
Identification of the bacterial isolates using molecu lar 
approach, and recovery of biodegradation products of 
textile effluent generated by the isolated bacterial 
species including verification of the enzymes 
responsible for rapid decolorization of the dyes could 
be carried out as the future work.
