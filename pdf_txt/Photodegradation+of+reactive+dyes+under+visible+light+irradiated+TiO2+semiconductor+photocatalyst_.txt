Problem Formulation  
Reactive dyes are the largest class  of dyes used in the textile industry . They  were  selected 
for the present  study because the t reatme nt of wastewaters containing the se dyes by 
conventional methods is often inadequate due to  their resistance to biological and chemical  
degradation . The use of reactive dyes  for textile dyeing has increased steadily over the last 
few years because of theirs  cost effectiveness and excellent  wash a nd light fastness 
properties. However, these dyes exhibit  a very low degree of fixation  on the fiber s, typically 
between 50 and 90%, which  results in the release of substantial amounts of the  compound s 
in the dyeing water.  The dyeing water  cannot be reused , so dye recovery is not an option 
with reactive dyes. The high aromaticity and low reactivity of these dyes make them  highly 
resistant to both microbial and  chemical degradation . Physical treatments are not efficient 
because they transfer  the toxic dyes f rom one medium to the other , without converting them  
to harmless non -toxic substances.  
The development of novel treatment methods, called  Advanced Oxidation Processes 
(AOP s), characterized by production of the hydroxyl radical ( ·OH) as a primary oxidant , 
could represent a solution . The application of these AOPs, alone or simultaneously, could 
enhance ·OH radical production leading to higher oxidation rates.  
In this work, the photocatalytic oxidative decolorization of various r eactive dyes , Reactive 
Blue 4 , Reactive Red 120 and Reactive Violet 5,  under exposure to visible  light and in the 
presence of new semiconductor catalyst s, was investigated.  
The results suggest that Reactive Blue 4 is highly unstable under exposure to visible light, 
thus the presence of photocatalysts is not necessary for the degradation of this dye.  
The Reactive Red 120 cannot be treated by direct irradiation and it cannot be decolorized 
even in the presence of photocatalysts.  
The other results obtained indicate that  the photocataly tic treatment under visible light can 
be an effective method for the removal of R eactive Violet 5 from textile  effluents.  2 
 To enhance the Reactive Violet 5 decolorization yields, the operational parameters  such as 
pH, catalyst loading and hydrogen peroxide concentration, were optimized .  
 
 
 
Work Accomplished  
The work done in this study has been presented in three  chapters as discussed in the 
following text .  
In Chapter 1  the different types of dyes, particularly the reactive dyes, were described. The 
traditional methods (physical, biological and chemical) for removal of dyes from 
wastewaters  were also described. Then, n ew methods for removal of dyes from wastewaters  
(Advanc ed Oxidation Processes ) were reported.  Among them, particular attention were 
given to the heterogeneous photocatalysis. The different types of catalyst and light sources 
that can be used, were also described.  
In Chapter 2  the recent advances in synt hetic dyes photocatalytic d ecolorization  were 
reported. The parameters affecting the photocatalytic processes (dye type, dye 
concentration, catalyst loading, pH, concentration of hydrogen peroxide, aeration, light 
source) were described. A comparison betwe en the traditional light sources and the new 
light sources, such as the LEDs, was also reported.  
In Chapter 3  experimental pro cedures, description of reactor , instruments used and 
analytical techniques are discussed in detail. The decoloriza tion of Reacti ve Blue 4, 
Reactive Red 120 and Reactive Violet 5, respectively, was studied. The influence of the type 
of catalyst, of pH, of catalyst concentration and hydrogen peroxide concentration, on the 
photocatalytic process was investigated. The optimal decoloriz ation conditions were found.  
The results were compared with those obtained from other authors.  
Finally, the conclusions and recommendations for future works, were reported.

Introduction  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
1.1 Introduction  
Textile industries use over 10,000 different dyes and pigments, and over 200,000 tons of 
these dyes are lost to effluents every year during the dyeing and finishing operations, due to 
the inefficiency of the dyeing process [1 , 2]. Unfortunately, many of these dyes persist in the 
environment because they have high stability to light, temperature, water, detergents, 
chemicals and soaps [3 ]. Moreover, many anti -microbial agents (resistant to biological 
degradation) are often, used in the manufacture of textiles, especially for natural fi bers [3 ; 
4]. The synthetic origin and complex aromatic structure of the dyes make them more 
recalcitrant to biodegradation [5 , 6]. However, environmental legislation obliges industries 
to eliminate color from their dye -containing effluents, before disposal  into water bodies [2 ; 
4].  
Dyes not only seriously affect the aesthetic quality and transparency of water bodies like 
lakes, rivers and others, leading to damage to the aquatic environment [7 , 8], but also some 
of them can show toxic effects, especially c arcinogenic and mutagenic events [9 , 10]. 
The removal of the dyes is very difficult because they are designed to be resistant to 
biodegradation, thus  they remain in the environment for a long period of time. For example, 
the half -life of the hydrolyzed dy e Reactive Blue 19 is about 46 years at pH 7 and 25°C [11 , 
12]. Moreover, Carneiro et al. (2010), have monitored the dyes C.I. Disperse Blue 373 
(DB373), C.I. Disperse Orange 37 (DO37) and C.I. Disperse Violet 93 (DV93) in 
environmental samples. They have found that DB373, DO37 and DV93 were present in both 
untreated river water and drinking water. This suggests that the traditional effluent 
treatments (pre -chlorination, flocculation, coagulation and flotation) generally used by 
drinking water treatment pla nts, was not completely effective in removing these dyes. The 
mutagenic activity detected in these effluents confirms these results [13].

 1.2 Dyes and Pigments  
Organic color ants can be distinguished in two classes, dyes and pigments [14]. They differ 
because dye s are soluble in water and/or  organic solvent s, while pigments are insoluble in 
both types of liquid media. Dyes are used to color  substrates to which they have affinity. 
Pigments can be used to color  polymeric substrates. The mechanism is diffe rent from that of 
dyes, because color ation involves the materials surface only.  
 
 
1.3 Dyes classification  
All the aromatic compounds absorb electromagnetic energy, but only those that absorb light 
with wavele ngths in the visible range (~400 -700 nm) are col ored. A dye molecule is made 
up of chromophores , delocalized electron systems with conjugated double bonds, and 
auxochromes , electron -withdrawing or electron -donating substituents that can cause or 
intensify the color of the chromophore by modifying the en ergy of the electron system. 
Tipycal chromophores are  ethylene group  (-C=C -), carbon -nitrogen group ( -C=N -), 
carbonyl group ( -C=O ), azo group ( -N=N -), nitro group ( -NO 2) and aromatic rings. 
Auxochromes are amino ( –NH 2), carboxyl ( -COOH ), sulphonate ( -SO 3H) and hydroxyl ( -
OH) groups. There are about thirty different groups of dyes. They can be differentiated by 
the chemical structure or chromophore.  
The chemical classification of dyes is based on the type of chromophore that is in the 
molecule  (i.e. CI Cons titution Number such as nitro, azo, carotenoid, diphenylmethane,  
xanthene, acridine, quinoline, indamine, sulphur, amino - and hydroxy ketone,  
anthraquinone, indigoid, phthalocyanine, inorganic pigment, etc.) . The technical 
classification is based on the ap plication technique of the dye  (i.e. CI Generic Name such as 
acid, basic, direct, disperse, mordant, reactive,  sulphur dye, pigment, vat, azo insoluble) .  
Considering only the general structure, the textile dyes are also classified in anionic,  
nonionic and  cationic dyes. The major anionic dyes are the direct, acid and reactive dyes .  
The major nonionic dyes are disperse dyes that does not ionised in the aqueous  environment. 
The major cationic dyes are the azo basic, anthraquinone disperse and  reactive dyes.   
Almost two -third of all organic dyes are azo dyes (R 1-N=N -R2). They are  used in a number 
of different industrial processes such as textile dyeing and printing, color  photography,  
finishing processing of leather,  pharmaceutical and cosmethics.  
Most notable azo -dyes are: acid dyes, basic dyes (cationic dyes), direct dyes  (substantive 
dyes), disperse dyes (non -ionic dyes), reactive dyes,  vat dyes and sulfur dyes.  5 
 1.3.1 Reactive Dyes  
The reactive dyes form one of largest dye classes.  Reactive dyes contain reactive groups that 
are able of forming covalent bonds between carbon atoms of dye molecule and OH -, NH -, 
or SH - groups in fibres (cotton, wool, silk, nylon).  
A reactive dye  is characterized by its functional group. The reactive group can be a 
heterocyclic aromatic ring substituted with a chloride or fluoride atom. Another important 
reactive group is the vinyl sulphone (─SO 3─CH═CH 2) one.  
During dyeing i n alkaline conditions (i.e. pH 9 -12), at high temperatures (30 -70 ºC), and salt 
concentration  from 40 -100 g/L, reactive dye s form a reactive vinyl sulfone  group, which  
creates a bond with the textile fibres (Figure 1.1). Anyway,  the competition between the dye 
fixation reaction on the fibres and the undesired hydrolysis of the reactive group, resul ts in a 
high loss of color (10–50%) in the re sulting waters of the process.  
To increase the fixation degree of the dye on the fibres, different types of salts (up 60 to 200 
g/L) can be added during the dyeing process.  
 
 
Figure 1.1 - Principle of cotton dyeing with a triazyl reactive dye  [250] . 
 
 
1.3.2 Acid dyes  
Acid dyes are anionic compounds used in dyeing nitrogen -containing fabrics like wool, 
polyamide, silk and modified acryl  [14, 243] . They bind to the cationic NH 4+ ions of those 
fibres.  Acid dyes are typically applied  to a textile at low pH, infact  the term “acid”  refers to 
the pH of the dyebaths.  Acid dyes are caractherised by a high fixation degree: 80 –95%.  
 
 
 
6 
 1.3.3 Metal complex dyes  
Among acid and reactive dyes, many metal complex dyes can be found. These are strong 
complexes of one metal atom (usually chromium, copper, cobalt or nickel) and one or two 
dye molecules, respectively.  
 
 
1.3.4 Direct dyes  
Direct dyes are mostly azo dyes with more than one azo bond or phthalocyanine, stilbene or 
oxazine compounds  [14, 243] . Direct dyes were originally developed for theirs high affinity 
for cellulose fibres, and are water -insoluble. They can be used to dye polyester, but also 
nylon, cellulo se triacetate, and acrylic fibers. T hey bind to the fibres through v an der Waal s 
forces. The dyes are, usually, finely ground in the presence of a dispersing agent to obtain a 
paste, or spray -dried to obtain a powder. Sometimes, a dyeing temperature of 130 °C, is 
required, and a pressurized dyebath is used. The dyeing rate can be influenced by the kind of 
dispersing agent used during the grinding.  
 
 
1.3.5 Basic dyes  
Most basic dyes are anthraquinone or azo compounds.  Basic dyes are water -soluble cationic 
dyes [14, 244] . They can be used to dye acrylic fibers (they bind  to the acid groups of the 
fiber s), wool and silk. Acetic acid can be add  to the dye bath to help the dyeing process. 
Basic dyes are also used in the paper industry.  
 
 
1.3.6 Mordant dyes  
Most mordant dyes are azo, oxazine or triarylmethane compounds . Mordant dyes  require a 
mordant , a chemical that combines with the dye and the fiber . The choice of mor dant is very 
important because different mordants can change the final color significantly.  
The most important mordant dyes are the synthetic mordant dyes, or chrome dyes, used for 
wool. It is important to note that many mordants, particularly those in the heavy metal 
category, can be hazardous to health and extreme care must be taken in using them  [244-
248].  
 
 7 
 1.3.7 Disperse dyes  
Disperse dyes are usually small azo or nitro compounds, anthraquinones or metal complex 
azo compounds.  Disperse dyes are generally insoluble dyes. They can be used with  synthetic 
fiber s (cellulose acetate, polyester, polyamide, acryl, etc.)  [243] . The dye diffusion requires 
swelling of the fibre s, thus  high tem peratures ( > 120 °C) or chemical softners have to be 
used. Dyeing process takes place in dyebaths with fine disperse solutions of these dyes.  
 
 
1.3.8  Pigment dyes  
Pigment dyes are usually azo or anthraquinones compounds or metal complex 
phthalocyanines.  
Pigment dyes (or organic pigments) are insoluble, non -ionic compounds or insoluble salts. 
Pigment dyes are used in aqueous solution so a dispersing agent is required. Pigments can 
be combined  with thickeners in print pastes for printing diverse fabrics  [1, 14].  
 
 
1.3.9  Vat dyes  
Vat dyes are essentially insoluble in wat er and incapable of dyeing fiber s directly  [244] . 
However, reduction in alkaline liquor produces the water -soluble alkali metal salt of the dye, 
which, in this leuco form, has an affinity for the textile fibre. Therefore,  the soluble leuco 
vat dyes can impregnate the fabric. Subsequent oxidation reforms  the original insoluble dye. 
The color of denim is due to indigo, the original vat dye. Vat dyes are anthraquinones or 
indigoids. They are usually used for dyeing cellulose fib ers.  
 
 
1.3.1 0 Sulphur dyes  
Sulph ur dyes  are complex polymeric aromatics with heterocyclic S -containing rings. They 
are used to dye cellulose fibres  [243] .  
The fabric is usually heated in a solution of an organic compound (sulfide or polysulfide  or 
nitrophenol deriv ative) that reacts with the sulph ur dye and forms a dark color that bind to 
the fib ers.  
 
 
 8 
 1.3.1 1 Solvent dyes  
Lysochromes or “solvent dyes” are nonpolar  or weakly polar  and they cannot be ionizated. 
Solvent dyes  are not soluble in water but they are soluble in organic solvents , thus they are 
used to color hydrocarbon fuels, waxes , lubricants , plastics , and other hydrocarbon -based 
non-polar materials  [1, 14] .  
Solvent dyes are usually diazo compounds, but con also be triarylmethane, anthraquinone 
and phthalocyanine solvent dyes.  
Structures of some organic dyes from dif ferent classes are given in Figure  1.2. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.2 – Molecular structure of various organic dyes . 
 
9 
 In Table 1.1 the fixation efficiency of some azo -dyes are reported.  
 
Table 1.1 - Fixation degree of different dye classes on textile support . 
 
Dye class  Fibre type  Fixation degree (%)  Loss in effluent (%)  
Acid  Polyamide  80-95 5-20 
Basic  Acrilic  95-100 0-5 
Direct  Cellulose  70-95 5-30 
Disperse  Polyester  90-100 0-10 
Metal complex  Wool  90-98 2-10 
Reactive  Cellulose  50-90 10-50 
Sulphur  Cellulose  60-90 10-40 
Dye-stuff Cellulose  80-95 5-20 
 
Table 1.1 shows that reactive dyes exhibit  a very low degree of fixation  on the fiber, 
typically between 50 and 90% , which  results in the release of substantial amounts of the  
these dye s in the dyeing water s [86, 249] . 
 
 
1.4 Traditional methods for removal of dyes from wastewater  
Due to their synthetic nature and mainly aromatic  structure , most of  dyes are non -
biodegradable, having carcinogenic action or causing allergies, dermatitis, skin  irritation or 
different tissular changes. Moreover, various azo dyes, mainly aromatic  compounds, show 
both acute and chronic toxicity. High potential health risk is caused by  adsorption of azo 
dyes and their breakdown products (toxic amines)  [9, 10, 14] . For these reasons, n owdays , 
government legislation regarding the removal of dyes from industrial effuents, is becoming 
more and more stringent,  especially in developed countries.  
This means that eff luents must  be treated before discharging into watercourses or water 
bodies in general.  The treatment  methods can be divided into three categories: chemical, 
physical and biological.  
 
 
1.5 Physical methods  
One of the most effective and economically advantageous is  the adsorption. This process 
produces a high quality product [15]. Decoloriz ation occurs both by adsorption and ion 
exchange [16] and it is influenced by many ph ysio-chemical factors, such as dye/adsorbent 
interaction, sorbent surface area,  particle size, temperature, pH, and c ontact time [17] .  
There are several types of adsorbent materials.  10 
 1.5.1. Activated carbon  
Activated carbon is very e ffective for adsorbing different types of dyes: cationic, mordant, 
and acid dyes but it is less effec tive for treating dispersed, direct, vat, pigment and reactive 
dyes [19,  51]. The effectiveness of the process is strongly influenced by the type of carbon 
used and the characteristics of the wastewater. Activated carbon is not suitable for all types 
of liquid effluents, and it is also very expensive.  
The activated carbon activity decreases during the time, so it need s to be reactivated. 
Reactivation, however, results in 10 –15% loss of the sorbent.  
 
 
1.5.2. Peat  
Peat is able to adsorb transition metals and polar organic compounds from dye -containing 
wastewaters. Peat is cheaper than activated carbon, and does not need to be reactivated [20]. 
Due to its cellular structure, it has a large surface area, and good capa city for adsorption.  
 
 
1.5.3. Wood chips  
Wood chips  are able to absorb acid dyes, but adsorption requires long contact time [20].  
Moreover, wood chips are not as good as other available sorbents [21-23].  
 
 
1.5.4. Silica gel  
Silica gel is a granular, vit reous, porous form of silicon dioxide made synthetically from 
sodium silicate. Silica gel contains a nano -porous silica micro -structure, suspended inside a 
liquid. It is very e ffective for removing basic dyes, but it is not used commercially  [249] . 
 
 
1.5.5 . Other materials  
Some substrates such as natural clay, corn cobs, rice hulls can be e fficiently used for dye 
removal, especially because of their low cost and high availability. They are cheaper than 
activated carbon and they have  often allowed achieving high removal yields  [21-25]. These 
materials don’t  require any regeneration . 
 
 11 
 1.5.6 . Membrane filtration  
This method is used to clarify, concentrate and separate dye continuously from effluent s [26, 
27]. It has better features than some other methods: resistance to temperature, an adverse 
chemical environment, and microbial attack. After separation , a concentrated residue is 
obtained; this is d ifficult to dispose. Some other  problems can be re presented by the 
clogging or the replacement of the membrane. Membrane filt ration  can be successfully 
employed  for water re -cycling within a textile dye plant if the effluent contains low 
concentration of dyes, but it is not effective to reduce the dissolv ed solid content, which 
makes water re -use a difficult task.  
 
 
1.5.7 . Ion exchange  
Wastewater passes trough the coloumn that contains the ion exchange resin until the 
available exchange sites are saturated. Ion exchange  is mainly effective for removing 
anionic and cation dyes from dye -containing effuent s. This me thod is not able for treating 
other dyes, such as disperse dyes [16, 26] . Ion exchange is very interesting because there is 
no loss of adsorbent during regeneration, but it remains an expensive meth od. Organic 
solvents are expensive, and the ion exchange method is not very effective for disperse dyes.  
 
 
1.5.8 . Irradiation  
Organic pollutants, such as dyes contained in wastewaters, can be easly broken down by 
radiations, but a sufficient quantity of di ssolved oxygen is required . Dissolved oxygen is 
consumed very rapidly;  therefore, a constant supply is necessary . For this reason the  process 
is very expensive. This method allowed obtaining high removal yields , at a laboratory scale, 
in treating some dyes  and phenolic molecules [28].  
 
 
1.5.9. Electro -kinetic coagulation  
Electro -kinetic coagulation is an economically feasible method of  dye removal. This method 
requi res the addition of ferrous sulphate and ferric chloride. It is very effective for the 
removal of direct dyes from wastewaters. It is not sui table for treating of acid dyes  because 
of the high cost of the ferrous sulphate and ferric chloride. This process is not commonly  
used, because  the sludge formed as part of the coagulation is very difficult to remove [26].   12 
 1.6. Biological treatments  
1.6.1. Decoloriz ation by white -rot fungi  
White -rot fungi are organisms able to degrade lignin, the structural polymer coming from 
woody plants [29]. White -rot fungi are also  able to degrade dyes using enzymes, such as 
lignin peroxidases (LiP) or manganese dependent peroxidases (MnP). Other enzymes can be 
used to degrade dyes: glucose -1-oxidase and glucose -2-oxidase, along with lacca se, and a 
phenoloxidase enzyme [30 -32]. Azo dyes, can be successfully degraded by P. 
chrysosporium  [33], but other fungi such as, Hirschioporus larincinus, Inonotus hispidus, 
Phlebia tremellosa  and Coriolus versicolor  can also be used [32, 35 -37].  
 
 
1.6.2. Other microbial cultures  
The ability of ba cteria to metabolise azo dyes were  widely investigated. Mixed bacterial 
cultures from different habitats were  able to de coloriz e the diazolinked chromophore of dye 
molecules in 15 days [38]. Some researchers [21 -23] verified that a mixture of dyes could  be 
decolorize d by anaerobic bacteria in 24 -30 h,  using free growing cells or in the form of 
biofilms on various support materials. They also verified  the use of bacteria for azo dye 
biodegradation  [40]. Anyway, t hese microbial systems requi res a fermentat ion process and 
cannot be used for treating large volumes of textile effluents.  Azo dyes cannot be 
immediat ely metabolised under aerobic co nditions, but it was found that Pseudomonas  
strains are able to aerobically degrade some azo dyes  [41]. However, the intermediates 
coming from these degradative steps caused the disruption of metabolic pathways, thus the 
dyes were not actually mineralised. Under anaerobic conditions, many bacteria reduce azo 
dyes through the activity of unspecific, soluble, reductases, c alled azo reductases. These 
enzymes can cause the production of color less aromatic amines which are  toxic, mutagenic, 
and carcinogenic to animals.  
Further research using mesophilic and thermophilic microbes also showed their ability  to 
degrade and decolorize dyes [21 -23, 35 -37]. 
 
 
1.6.3. Adsorption by living/dead microbial biomass  
Biosorption is the uptake or accumulation of chemicals by microbial mass [17, 42 -44]. Dead 
bacteria, yeast s and fungi , can be used for treating dye -containing effluents. Different results 
can be obtained by varying the type of dye and biomass. Some dyes have a particular 13 
 affinity for binding with microbial species. For example it was observed that biomass 
derived from the  thermotolerant ethanol -producing yeast strain s, K. marxianus IMB3 , 
showed a relati vely high biosorption capacity  for dye removal [45].  The biomass can be 
used especially if the dye -containing effluent is very toxic. Biomass adsorption can be 
successfully used when decolorization  by microbial colture cannot be used [46]. It was  
demonstrated that bacterial cells are able to adsorb reactive dyes  [42, 43]. A ctinomyces were 
employed to adsorb anthroquinone, phalocyanine and azo dyes from wastewaters  [47]. 
Bioso rption is very quick: it requi res few minutes in algae and few hours in bacteria [42, 
43].  
 
 
1.6.4. Anaerobic textile -dye bioremediation systems  
Azo dyes represent almost 60 -70% of all textile dyestuffs . These dyes are soluble in 
solution, and cannot be removed by conventional biological treatments. Reactive dyes, 
especially, are the most problematic compounds in textile effluents [48-50]. Anaerobic 
bioremediation is useful to decolo rize azo and other wat er-soluble dyes. The process 
involves an oxidation -reduction reaction with hydrogen. (In aerobic systems free molecular 
oxygen is involved).  The anaerobic degradation of a textile effluent only involves 
decolo rization of the solution, but  the dye molecule is not mineralized.  
 
 
1.7 Chemical methods  
1.7.1 Oxidative process  
Oxidative process  is the most common chemical method of d ecolorization . The main 
oxidising agent is usually hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2). It needs to be preliminar ily activated  
by ultra-violet  light or other sources . Many methods of chemical d ecolorization  can be 
classified  according to the activation mode of H 2O2 [51].  The chemical oxidation of a dye 
involves the opening of the aromatic ring of the dye molecule  [52].  
 
 
1.7.2 H 2O2 + Fe(II) salts  
Fenton ’s reagent can be successfully used f or treating textile wastewaters, which are 
resistant to biologica l treatment or are toxic to biomass [51]. One of the main  drawback of 
this method is the sludge generation due t o flocculation of the reagent and the dye 14 
 molecules. The sludge contains the concentrate d impurities, so it requires to be disposed  of. 
It can be generally incinerated to produce power, even though  this step is not 
environmentally friendly.  
 
 
1.7.3  Ozonation  
Ozone is a powerfu l oxidising agent. It has an hi gher oxidation potential (2.07 V) than 
chlorine (1.36  V), and H 2O2 (1.78  V). Ozonation can be used to degrade te xtile dyes, 
chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenols, pestic ides and aromatic hydrocarbons [53, 27] . The 
ozone dosage that can be utilised depends on the tot al colo r and total organic carbon (TOC)  
of the dye -containing effluents . Dyes have to be removed with no residue or sludge 
formation [54] and no toxic metabolites [55].  After oz onation an effuent with no colo r and 
low TOC (suitable for discharge into water bodies) is obtained [27]. This method gives good 
results especially when double -bonded dye molecules [51] are treated. Ozone can be used in 
its gaseus state so it does not increase the volume of wastewater and sludge .  
A drawback of ozonation is its short half -life (about 20 minutes). This time decreases if dyes 
and salts are present  in the treated solution , and it also depends on pH and temperature 
conditions. For example in alkaline conditions, ozone decomposition goes faster, so it is 
very important to regulate the effluent pH [51].  Results can be improved using irradiation 
[57] or with a membrane filtrat ion technique [56].  A weakness of the process  is its high cost, 
actually continuous ozonation is re quired due to its short half -life [27].  
 
 
1.7.4  Photochemical  
This method  is able to degrade the dye molecules using the combined action of UV 
radiation s and hydrogen peroxide  [58, 59] . Dye molecules can be completely mineralized 
and form CO 2 and H 2O. Several literature studies  carried out the degradation  of commercial 
dyes by UV/H 2O2 in aqueous solutions . Enhanced efficiency of UV/H 2O2 oxidation at 
alkaline pH region was attributed  to hydroxyl radical formation [60, 61] . It was also 
reported that the decolorization of C. I. Acid Black 1 decreased with increasing solution pH 
due to decomposition of H 2O2 into water and oxygen rather than hydroxyl radical formation 
[62-64]. A suitable H 2O2 dosage showed enhanced performance of the process to degrade 
crystal violet [65]. This process produces a high concentration of hydroxyl radicals that 
quickly degrade dye molecules. The process can be inf luenced by the intensity of the UV 15 
 radiation, pH, type of dye and dye -bath composition [32] . A drawback is the generation of 
by-products such as halides, metals, inorganic acids, organic aldehydes  and org anic acids 
[58]. This method does not generate sludg e and it is effective for the odours removal.  
 
 
1.7.5  Sodium hypochloride  
Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)  is a clear, slightly yellowish solution with a characteristic 
odour.  It is used on a large scale for surface purification, bleaching, odo ur removal and  
water disinfection.  
When sodium hypochlorite dissolves in water, two products  are formed.  They play an 
important role for oxidation and disinfection. These substances are hypochlorous acid 
(HOCl) and hypochlorite ion (OCl-). Hypochlorous acid is divided i nto hydrochloric acid 
(HCl) and oxygen  (O). The oxygen atom is a very strong oxidator.  The pH of the water 
determines how much hypochlorous acid is formed.  
Sodium hypochlorite is used on a large scale . For example in agriculture , chemical 
industries, paint - and lime industries, food industries, glass industries, paper industries, 
pharmaceutical industries, synthetics industries and waste disposal industries. In the textile 
industry  sodium hypochlorite is used to bleach textile s. It can also be added to industrial 
wastewater to reduce odo urs. Hypochlorite neutralizes sulphur hydrogen gas (SH) and 
ammonia (NH 3) and detoxifies  cyanide baths in metal industries. Hypochlorite can be used  
to prevent algae and shellfish growth in cooling towers. In water treatment, hypochlorite is 
used to disinfect water. It also is effective agains t bacteria, viruses and fungi.  
The use of chlorides for dye removal  is becoming less frequent due to the negative  effects it 
has when released into waterways [51] and the release of aromatic amines  which are 
carcinogenic, or otherwise toxic molecules  [35-37]. 
 
 
1.8 New  methods for removal of dyes from wastewater : Advanced Oxidation Processes   
Traditional methods for treating textile wastewaters are not very effective: b iological 
methods require the use of micro -organisms whose activity is strongly inhibited by the 
levels of effluent toxicity . Physical methods only transfer dye s from one phase to another, 
but the problem still remains unsolved. The d rawbacks  of the chemical process es are the 
formation of sludge, its disposal and the space needed.   16 
 Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) represent  a new promising technology for the 
treatment of wastewaters containing recalcitrant  organic compounds. All AOP s are designe d 
to produce hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl  radicals , in fact,  are very  effective  to destroy 
organic compounds. AOPs are able to completely mineralise pollutant s by converting them 
into water and carbon dioxide .  
There are different types of AOPs, based on chemical, photochemical, sonochemical, and 
electrochemical reactions .   
 
 
1.8.1 The hydroxyl radical  
The hydroxyl radical is a powerfu l oxidant (HO∙ + H+ + e -  → H 2O). Its oxidation standard 
potential is E° (∙OH/H 2O) = 2.8 V/SHE  [251] . This radical is able to quickly degrade 
organic and organometallic pollutants until  their complete mineralization into CO 2, H2O and 
inorganic ions. The  hydroxil  radica l react s rapidly with org anics (R) mainly by the 
abstraction of a hydrogen atom (aliphatics) or the addition on an unsaturated bond 
(aromatics) to initiate a radical oxidation chain:  
 
RH  +   ·OH  →   H 2O + ·R                                                                                                 (1.1)  
 
·R  +   O 2   →    ROO ·                                                                                                         (1.2)  
 
ROO ·   +    RH    →   ROOH    +    ·R                                                                                 (1.3) 
 
ArH   +   ·OH    →    ArH(OH) ·                                                                                           (1.4) 
 
ArH(OH) ·   +   ·O2   →    [ArH(OH)OO] ·                                                                            (1.5)  
 
[ArH(OH)OO] ·   →   ArH(OH)  +   HO 2·                                                                            (1.6) 
 
 
1.8.2  Electrochemical destruction  
The electrochemical oxidation is an efficient process for recovery and re -use of textile 
wastewater  [66]. The efficiency of the process was comprovated by many studies:  for a 
dyeing wastewater , a complete removal of the color was found within only 6 min utes of 17 
 electrolysi s [67 ]. In conventional electro -oxidation processes, contaminants can be removed 
by direct oxidation , in which the pollutant is oxidized by electron transfer directly to the 
anode material, or indirect oxidation , in which the electron transfer is med iated by an 
oxidant species [68, 69] such as the hydroxyl radical ( ·OH) from water discharge.  
Contaminants may also be oxidized by other oxidants, such as active chlorine (Cl 2, HClO, 
and ClO-), S 2O82−, and  P2O84−, when chloride, sul phate, an d phosphate containing sol utions 
are used, respectively [69 ]. The process is also influenced by the anode materia l and 
electrolysis conditions [71 -74]. 
The electrochemical processes are able to remove the pollutants without add ing chemicals. 
The main drawback of electrochemical processes is the use of electric energy that increase s 
the costs.  
The main advantages of this treatment are considered the requirement of simple equipment 
and operation, low temperature in comparison with o ther non -electrochemical treatments, no 
requirement of any additional chemicals, easy control but crucial for pH. Moreover, the 
electrochemical reactors (with electrolytic cells) are compact, and environmental friendly 
because all the emissions are minimiz ed  and undesired by -products are not generated.  
 
 
1.8.3  Photocatalysis  
In chemistry, photocatalysis is the acceleration of a photoreaction in the presence of a 
catalyst.  Photocatalysis is a potential new method to eliminate recalcitrant organic 
compounds  from wastewaters . It is based on physically and chemically induced processes. 
Photocatalysis can be homogeneous [60, 61, 64, 65] or heterogeneous  [180] .  
 
 
1.8.4  Homogeneous photocatalysis  
In homogeneous photocatalysis, the reactants and the photocatalyst s exist in the same phase.  
The most commonly  used homogeneous photocatalyst  include hydrogen peroxide  as it is 
reported in the paragraph (1.7.4).  
 
 
1.8.5 Heterogeneous photocatalysis  
Heterogeneous photo catalysis has the catalyst in a different phase from the reactants.  
Physically, heterogene ous photocatalysis involves a 4 - step process:  18 
 • transport of the pollutant from bulk of the solution onto the surface of the photocatalyst;  
• adsorption;  
• photoreaction;  
• desorption of final products from the surface to the bulk again.  
The photoreaction mechanism  can be summarized as follows : 
 
 Photoexcitation: when a photocatalyst absorbs a photon of light having energy 
greater than its band -gap energy , an electron is promoted from the valence band of 
the irradiated particle to its conduction band, producing a positively charged hole in 
the valence band and an electron in the conduction band (Eq. ( 1.7)).  
These charges migrate to the particle surface and react with adsorbed species  (Eqs. 
(1.14) and (1.15)) . Both oxidation and reduction processes commonly take place on 
the surface of the photoexcited semiconductor photocatalyst.  
 Ionization of water:  water molecules can react with photogenerated holes to produce 
hydroxyl radicals (Figure 1.3). Hydroxyl radical s attack the adsorbed organic 
molecules or those that are very close to the  catalyst surface non -selectively causing 
them to mineralize (Eq. (1.13)).  
 Oxygen ionosorption: w hile the photogenerated hole  reacts with surface bound water 
or OH- to produce the  hydroxyl radical, the conduction band electron reduce s 
absorbed oxygen to form superoxide radical anion  (O2-·) (Eq. (1.10)) . This 
superoxide ion can not only take part in the further  oxidation process but also 
prevents the electron -hole recombination (Eq. (1.8)).  
 Protonation of superoxide: t he generated superoxide can be protonated forming 
hydroperoxyl radical (HO 2·) (Eq. (1.11)) and then  H2O2 which further dissociates to 
highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ( ·OH) (Eq.(1.12)) .

1.9 Photocatalysts for heterogeneous photocatalysis  
The oxidation reaction will occur if the valence band (VB) of the catalyst has a higher 
oxidation potential than the species that have to be treated. The redox potential of the 
valence band and the conductance band for several semiconductor s ranges between +4.0 and 
-1.5 Volts versus Normal Hydrogen E lectrode (NHE). Therefore, by choosing the suitable 
catalyst, it is possible to treat different species trough  the photocatalytic processes . Metal 
oxides are semiconductor materials suitable for phot ocatalysis .  
The wavelength of the light, required to activate a catalyst has to be equal or lower than that 
calculated by the Planck’s equation (Eq. 1.16):  
 
λ=hc / E bg                                                                                                                          (1.16 ) 
 
where Ebg is the semiconductor band -gap energy, h is the Planck’s constant and c is the 
speed of light.  
20 
 The photocatalyst s can be used under dispersed form (powder, aqueous suspension) or in 
thin film form (fixed catalytic layer)  [226] .  
The dispersed catalyst s present  several advantages: they are  easy to use, they possess  an 
important specific surface, and they can be aerated to prevent  the recombining of e lectron -
hole pairs and increase  the catalyst efficiency. However, a drawback of the dispersed form is 
the progressive formation of dark catalytic sludge, that diminishes the efficiency of light 
irradiation and reduces the photoreactor performances. In contrast, for the catalysts in form  
of film, there is no need to separate the catalytic particles at the end of the pro cess, but, o n 
the other hand, the catalytic layer has  to be very stable and active.  
The amount and type of catalyst to be used depend on the irradiation source, the nature  and 
concentration of pollutant s to be treated, and the photoreactor. The pH value of the medium 
have to be optimized according to the type of pollutant  and to the type of catalyst . 
 
 
1.9.1 Titanium dioxide  
Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is a  white powder semicon ductor having a wide band gap of 3.0 –
3.2 eV. TiO 2 is one of the most suitable semicondu ctors for photocatalysis and it can be  
applied into various photocatalytic reactions [ 75-85]. This is due to its high reactivity, 
aivalability, affordability, non -toxicity and photochemical stability. It can be excited by UV 
light with a wavelength below  ca. 430  nm.  
In general, titanium  exists in three different polymorphic forms (Figure 1.4) including 
anatase (tetragonal), rutile (tetragonal) and brookite (orthorhombic). Rutile is the most stable 
phase, but, anatase, is the most commonly polymorphic form used in photocatalysis.   
 
 
Figure 1.4 - Polymorphic forms of the TiO 2[226].  
Anatase phase is o ften found having particle size of 10 nm or less with a band  gap of 3.2 eV 
corresponding to a UV wavelength of 385 nm.  Rutile phase  generally exists having particle 
         Anatase                                       Rutile                                     Brookite  21 
 size in the order of 50 nm . Moreover, rutile has a smaller band gap of 3.0 eV with  excitation 
wavelengths extending to visible 410 nm range .  
TiO 2 nanoparticles  are w idely available commercially or can be easily  prepared using sol -
gel method. Heating the anatase phase  results in a gradual phase transfo rmation of anatase to 
rutile, thus, on the base of the method of preparation , mix phase  anatase -rutile can be easily 
prepared or purchased  [226] .  
If the source of irradiation is the UV light, the TiO 2 can be used without any modification, 
but, to use visible light, TiO 2 needs to be modified by non -metal and/or metal doping, dye 
sensitization, and coupling semiconductors . 
 
 
1.9.2 Non-metal doping:  N-doped TiO 2 
A drawback of TiO 2 for photocatalysis is that its band -gap is rather large, 3.0 -3.2 eV, and 
thus only a small fraction of the solar spectrum ( ʎ < 380 nm, corresponding to the UV 
region) can be absorbed. To reduce  the energy for photoexcitation, the researches focused 
their attention on doping TiO 2 with both transition metal (such as Fe, Cr, Co, Mo, and V) 
and non -metal impurities  (such as B, C, N, S, and F) [88 -100]. Doping with transition 
metals showed  positive a nd negativ e effects. Several authors reported that although metal 
ions doping decreases the photothreshold energy of TiO 2, the metal ions may also serve as 
recombination centers for electrons and holes, thus reducing the overall activity of the 
photocataly st. 
Recently, the interest in TiO 2 doping with non -metal ions, especially with nitrogen , grew 
considerably . N-doping can be obtained by various methods such as sputtering [ 101], 
treating of TiO 2 powders in ammonia atmosphere  [102], or hydrolysis with urea in the 
presence of organic or inorganic titanium -based compounds [ 103, 104 ].  
Besides the preparation procedure s, many other aspects must be elucidated about  the 
properties and behaviour  of N -doped TiO 2. First of all  the chemical nature, the location in 
the solid, and the involvement in photoactivity of the nitrogen species. Nitrogen can be 
found in different forms in chemical species, such as  NO x [105-110], substitutional N [111 -
114], or NH x [115] .  It is important to know if the species are interstitial or substitutional, 
because their behaviour  is very different and might affect the material properties. It is also 
important to know if the species tend to segregate at the surface of the material or are 
incorporated in sub -surface or bulk sites, because this can influence the surface reactivity 
and photocatalytic properties.  22 
 Another aspect is  the electronic structure of the doped material and the change of the optical 
gap [116,  117].  According to some  authors, the band gap of the solid is reduced due to a 
rigid valence band shift after doping [118,  119],  other  authors claim that the absorption of 
visible light by N -doped TiO 2 is due to the excitation of electrons caused by localized 
impurity states in the band -gap [120, 121].  Also, the N -doping induced modifications of the 
electronic structure may be different for the anatase and rutile polymorphs of TiO 2.  
Another object of investigation  is the interaction between N -impurities and oxygen 
vacancies. Some authors identified  the role played by  impurities (dopants, oxygen 
vacancies, hydroxyl groups) in the photo -activity of N -doped TiO 2 samples. In their opinion,  
the photocatalytic properties  of TiO 2, both in UV and vis -regions, can be largely improved 
by tailoring the number and type of defect s present in the photocatalyst.  
The last and probably most important question for photocatalysis is the effect of N -doping 
on the photocatalytic activi ty of TiO 2. A large part of the existing literature on N -doped 
TiO 2 materials agrees that the addition of nitrogen results in an improvement in visible light 
photocatalytic activity, but this explanation  is still controversial  [116]. For example, in a 
recent study on N -doped TiO 2 films obtained by the addition of ammonia during chemical 
vapour  deposition growth of TiO 2 [122], no evidence of photocatalytic activity in the visible 
was found.  
 
 
1.9.3 Photosensitization  
To extend the photo catalytic activity to the visible region, photocatalysts can be 
photosensitized by several colored organic and inorganic compounds. The most common 
method used for TiO 2 photosensitization involves surface modification s.  
This route is based on  the formation of ionic or covalent bonds between the surface of a 
semiconductor and chromophores (se nsitization mechanism ). Several organic dyes, such as 
erythrosine  B, porphyrines [ 149; 150 ], phtalocyanines [ 151; 152 ]) and metal complexes 
(with Fe(II) [4 2], Pt(IV) [ 153]), can be adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface. These species are able 
to absorb visible light and therefore promote an electron in the conduction band of the 
semiconductor. This mechanism is called photoinduced electron transfer  and can be 
summari sed as follow (Eq. (1.17); (1.18)):   
 
TiO 2-----S+hν  →TiO 2-----S*                                                                                           (1.17)  
TiO 2-----S*→TiO 2(e-
CB)-----S+                                                                                         (1.18)  23 
  
If the recombination step is eliminated , the oxidative degradation of the dye  can start . Many  
colored compounds may act as photosensitizers. Recent studies suggest that photosensitized 
degradation on photocatalyst  surfaces can be used  for treating colored pollutants such as 
textile dyes.  
 
 
1.9.4  Metal doping: Fe-TiO 2  
Metal doping  is another way to improve  the TiO 2 photoefficiency . It consists in  the 
introduction of impurities able to attract  one type of the photogenerated charges, e− or h+, 
reducing their recombinatio n probability. Doping of the nanoparticles surface with iron, can 
be used to achieve this goal.   
Fe3+ ions can act as shallow trapping sites for both  photoinduced CB (conduction -band) 
electrons and VB (valence  band)  holes. As a result, the photoinduced charges can be better  
separated and conserved for a longer time. Consequently, the redox  reactions of adsorbed 
species take place more eff iciently.  Iron is also considered an optimal doping agent because 
its radius (0.64 Å) is similar to that of Ti4+ (0.68 Å). Therefore, Fe ions can easily  be 
incorporated with the crystal lattice of TiO 2. The band -gap of iron is 2.6 eV, therefore, it 
reduce s the width of the energy gap of TiO 2 and increase s the effici ency of absorbing visible 
light. The material properties of the Fe -doped TiO 2 are strongly  dependent on the  crystal 
structure, the size of the nanoparticle s, and morphology,  which are correlated with the TiO 2 
method of synthesis . There are several methods of synthesising Fe doped TiO 2: sol–gel,  
hydrothermal, wet chemical synthesis , thermal hydrolysis and plasma oxidative pyrolysis. 
There are also some combined methods, such as combining  the sol –gel method with 
hydrothermal treatment .  
Another reason to synthesise Fe -doped TiO 2 is that TiO 2 is not effective for degradation of 
polymers. In fa ct, TiO 2 is polar, while organic  polymers are non -polar materials. For this 
reason  it is difficult to disperse  TiO 2 nanoparticles in the polymers . The n anoparticles  of 
TiO 2 can be well dispersed in organic medium  by surface modification with surfactant s, 
[123-125] coupling agents,  [126, 127 ] or polymers,  [128, 129] , but , these  modification s, 
could also reduce  the catalytic activity  of nano -catalyst. Although many methods have been 
proposed  to prepare active TiO 2, such as doping with metal ions  [130-134] or non -metal 
elements,  [135-137] the surface property of nanoparticles is  still polar.  It is essential,  for 
nano -TiO 2, to display non -polar surface property as  well as good catalytic activity. It was 24 
 found  that nano -TiO 2 display s better photocatalytic activity  for degradation of methyl 
orange after its surface was  modified by comp lex of Fe(acac) 3 [138].  
These modification s not only increase the catalytic activity (the ferric complex  acts as a 
photo -sensitizer), but also the surface oleophylicity (the  ferric complex al so acts as a 
surfactant). Hence, the modified  TiO 2 (Fe-TiO 2) should be a suitable photocatalyst for 
degradation  of both polar and non -polar substances.   
 
 
1.10 Natural light sources and artificial light sources for photocatalysis  
Lamps are artificial sources of visible, UV, or both UV/ visible  light. Lamps, can generally 
be divided in:  
 
 Incandescence lamps;  
 Electric discharge lamps;  
 Fluorescent lamps;  
 LED lamps.  
 
Radiations emitted by a natural source of light, such as the solar one, have a  varying  
intensity according to the country, the season and the weather conditions, but have the 
disadvantage of being unidirectional.  
 
 
1.10.1  Incandescence lamps  
Incandescent  lamps are made up of a base and a glass bulb containing  a filament .  An 
electric curren t flows through the filament making  it incandescent , therefore it can emit 
radiant energy including the visible wavelengths. The filament usually contains  tungsten, a 
metal having  a very high melting point (3770 K), that can  reach ve ry high temperatures 
(2700 -3000 K), ensuring high energy emissions with wavelengths in the visible  field. The 
glass bulb  also contains an inert gas, generally Ar or Kr , to limit the sublimation of the 
tungsten. The color temperature varies from 2700 K to 3000 K.  The emission s are mostly in 
the IR and almost absent  in the UV.  
Halogen lamps represented a development of the incandescence lamps. They contain a 
gaseous mixture of halogen gas (general ly iodine, bromine or chlorine) to avoid the 
evaporation of tungsten.  25 
 1.10.2  Gas dis charge lamps  
In discharge lamps, the production of light is caused by the emission of light radiations by a 
previously excited gas: when an electron returns to its stable orbit, a quantum of light energy 
is emitted.  When an electron is excitated, it is promoted from its stable orbit to a more 
external one. The electron can be excitated by external energy sources, such as high -energy 
photons or other electrons accelerated by an electric field. Because of the propertie s of 
electronic orbits, the electronic orbits are defined: to a fixed energy correspond  a well 
defined wavelength and a specific color .  Gas discharge lamps  are made up of a chamber, 
made of  glass or quartz , which  contains  a gaseous substance at a suitable  pressure. 
Generally, metallic vapours  such as sodium, (with emission into  the visible spectrum ), 
mercury  (with emission into the UV spectrum ), xenon and other rare gases, (with emission 
in the UV spectrum) are used. On the base of the discharge tube press ure, these types of 
lamps can be divided into high and low pressure lamps. Low pressure mercury usually has 
an emission spectrum consisting of a pair of lines in the ultraviolet ( at 254 and 185 nm.).  
High pressure mercury has an emission spectrum consistin g of a pair of lines in the visible 
field (blue, green). If pressure is increased, the emission spectrum will become continuos, 
but the wavelengths corresponding to the red color are absent. Low pressure lamps are only 
used for scientific applications requ iring UV radiations. There are also discharge lamps 
containing xenon as gaseous substance. Xenon allows obtaining an emission spectrum that 
reproduces the visible fraction of solar radiation. X enon also has a strong UV emission, with 
several bands  in the spectral range between 200 and 300 nm.   
 
 
1.10.3  Fluorescent lamps  
Fluorescent lamps use some substances (such as phosphors) able to absorb small wavelength 
electromagnetic radiations and to re -issue the relative energy in the form of longer 
wavelength radiations. These lamps exploit the emission of ultraviolet radiation from some 
gases and vapours  (mainly mercury) used in discharge tubes. Here the fluorescence 
phenomenon is exploited, properties that have some substances (phosphors) to absorb small 
wavelength electromagnetic radiations and to re -issue the relative energy in the form of 
longer wavelength radiation. The inner surface of the glass chamber  is treated with oxy -
sulphides , aluminates, tungstates, pho sphates and Ca, Mg, Zn silicate and  heavy metals such 
as copper or antimony . Tubular fluorescent lamps usually contain argon, and a small amount 
of mercury, to facilitate the discharge  start. This type of lamp is not suitable as UV sources.  26 
 1.10. 4 LED lamps  
A LED consists of a “p and n” type semiconductor junction.  It is a p –n junction diode that 
emits light when activated.  The p -n junctions in LEDs usually are made up of a mixture of 
Group III and Group V elements  such as  gallium arsenide, gallium arsenide phosphide, and 
gallium  phosphide.   In this p‐n junction, the p‐type region is dominated by positive  charges 
and the n‐type region is dominated by negative  charges. When a  suitable  voltage is applied 
across the  LED’s electrical contacts, current flows and electrons move  across the junction 
from the n‐type semiconductor regi on into  the p‐type semiconductor region. Electrons then 
combine with positive charges. This effect is called electroluminescence, and the color of 
the light  is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor.  
When a combination occurs, a quantum of electromagnetic energy is released in the form of 
light. The frequency and, therefore, the apparent color of the  emitted photons is 
characteristic of the semiconductor material.  So, different color LEDs can be obtained by  
changing the semiconductor composi tion of the chip used.  
Recently, LEDs were  found to  be an alternative for traditional light sources , and they were 
used in various application including UV curing, disinfection,  sensors and photocatalytic 
application s [139 -148]. LEDs generate  cold light because  of their low operating 
temperature. In  fact, 5 mm LEDs  are usually only 10 –25 °C warmer than the ambient 
temperature  during operation , whereas incandescent bulbs can be several  hundred degrees 
warmer under similar conditions.   
The energ y of the photons that leave the diode depends on the material used to make the 
LEDs.  At e ach wavelength of light corresponds  a certain  amount of energy.  Shorter 
wavelengths (especially those close to UV) contain more energy. LEDs can produce light of 
diffe rent wavelengths including infrared, UV,  and visible light.   
 
 
1.11 Kinetics  
It is very important to determine the reaction rate and the influence of different parameters 
on it. These parameters are: illumination intensity, catalyst type, oxygen concentration, pH, 
presence of inorganic ions and the concentration of organic reactant s. Several experiments 
show ed that the rate of photocatalytic oxidation of various organic pollutants  over 
illuminated nanocatalysts fit s the Langmuir –Hinshelwood (L –H) kinetics model equation  
[154].  The reaction rate is given by Equation 1.19: 
  27 
  = -  /   =  1k2 /(1+k2 )                                                                                            (1.19) 
 
where r is the oxidation rate of the dye (mg/L min), C is the bulk reactant concentration 
(mg/L), t the illumination time, k1 the reaction rate constant (mg/L min), and k2  is the 
equilibrium adsorption constant  (L/mg). For low solute  concentration, the equation can be 
simplified to a pseudo  first-order equation (Eqs. (1.20)  and (1.21)) :  
 = -  /   =  1k2  =                                                                                                        (1.20)  
Or  
    =     C                                                                                                                                          (1.21) 
After a few steps the equation becomes:  
ΔC/ C = (1 - e-t/τ)                                                                                                                             (1.22) 
where  τ is the inverse of the apparent reaction rate constant: τ = 1/k app . τ represents the 
expected value of time that a dye molecule remains in the solution before being removed.  
kapp , the reaction rate constant , is not a traditional rate -constant . It is a function of external 
system parameters such as light intensity, pH, cata lyst loading, geometry of photoreactor 
and initial concentration  of the pollutant .

2.1 Introduction  
Wastewaters, coming from textile industries, contain considerable amounts of dyes that can 
cause serious  damages to the ecosystem [181, 182]. Due their high molecular stability, these 
dyes can hardly be removed from the effluents by conventional treatment techniques [183]. 
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the new methods able to degrade these organic 
pollutants [182, 184, 185].  
 
 
2.2 Recent Advances in Synthetic Dyes Photocatalytic Decolorization  
Recent ly, studies about  photocatalytic treatment of dyes by using traditional light sources  
were carried out . Zielinska et al. (2003) [155] investigated the photocatalytic activity of two 
photocatalysts, TiO 2 Tytanpol -A11 and TiO 2 Degussa P -25, from the degradation of 
Reactive Red 198 (RR198), Acid Blac k 1 (AB1) and Acid Blue 7 (AB7), under UV -visible 
light. Dye treatment was carried out in a quartz photoreact or equipped with an external 
mercury lamp. All experiments were carried out  using a constant amount of photocatalyst 
(0.4 g/L), dye concentration (30 mg/L) and at constant pH (pH = 2). It was found that TiO 2 
Degussa P-25 exhibit ed a better photocatalytic activity than the other catalysts [160].  
In 2005 Gonçalves et al. [156] compared the relative efficacy of two photocatalysts: 
Degussa P -25 and Riedelde -Häen TiO 2 using the Reactive Orange 4 (3 8 mg/L) as model 
pollutant. UV -irradiation experiments were carried out using an immersion reactor fitted 
with a medium pressure 400 W Hg vapour lamp. The experiments were also carried out 
under sunlight exposure. The influence of various parameters such as pH (5.6 - 10 - 13) and 
catalyst co ncentration (0.36 – 1 g/L) was evaluated. It was observed  that, when sunlight was 
used as light source, Degussa P -25 catalyst was more efficient than the Riedel -de-Häen 
catalyst.  29 
 In 2005 Thi Dung et al. [161] used several commercial titania powders (Deguss a P-25 and 
Ishihara Sangyo ST -01) and TiO 2 supported on diatomite to study the degradation of 
React ive Red 3BA (RED -3BA) under UV -visible light and under different pH values (4 – 7 
– 9). The experiments were carried out in a photocatalytic reactor;  a 150  W halogen lamp 
was positioned inside a cylindrical Pyrex vessel surrounded by a circulating water jacket to 
cool the lamp. The halogen lamp had  a spectral emission ranging from 360 nm to 830 nm. It 
was observed that the rate constant for Degussa P -25 was hi gher than that achieved by using 
Ishihara Sangyo ST -01 (k obs = 3.3 × 10−2 min−1 for Degussa P -25 and 4 × 10−4 min−1 for 
Ishihara Sangyo ST -01). It was also found that the photo catalytic activity of supported TiO 2 
was twice smaller than TiO 2 Degussa P -25 (k P-25 = 3.3×10−2 min−1; kP25/diatomite  = 1.6×10−2 
min−1). Therefore,  Degussa P -25 was the best catalyst for dyes degradation, but 
TiO 2/diatomite could be separated more easily from the treated solution. Moreover, pH = 4 
was identified as the optimal pH value able to favour both adsorption and the consequent 
degradation rate.  
In 2007 Chatterjee et al. [157] studied the decolor ization of different dyes such as Reactive 
Red 11, Reactive Red 2, Reactive Orange 84, Reactive Orange 16 and Reactive Black 5. 
The experiments  were carried out in a flat -surfaced glass reactor illuminated with a 150 W 
xenon lamp. A filter solution containing sodium nitrite, copper sulphate  and ammonium 
hydroxide , was used as a UV -filter to eliminate light < 420 nm. TiO 2 nanoparticles  were 
used as catalysts. The influence of the initial dye concentration (10 – 100 mg/L) on the 
process was evaluated. The results demonstrated the capability of visible light/TiO 2 
photocatalytic system to decolo rize the triazine and vinylsulfone reactive d yes. Furthermore,  
the efficacy of the photodegradation depen ds on the susceptibility of the dyes as well as the 
intermediates formed.  
In the same year, Rupa et al. [158] used Reactive Yellow -17 (RY -17) as model pollutant to 
test the phot ocatalytic efficie ncy of Ag -TiO 2 nanoparticles (synthesized by sol –gel 
technique) under UV and visible light. A 200 W halogen lamp and  a 125W mercury lamp 
were used as visible and UV sources, respectively.  200  mL of the dye solution with 1.5 g/L 
of the photocatalyst were  taken in a photoreactor made up of pyrex glass. The influence of 
different parameters, (such as dye concentration, amount of hydrogen peroxide and pH) on 
the photocatalytic process, was evaluated. The photocatalytic efficiency of nano -TiO 2  
(synthesized b y sol –gel technique), nano -commercial TiO 2 (Degussa  P-25) and Ag -TiO 2 
was evaluated. An increase of the rate dyes degradation was found by using Ag -TiO 2 . 30 
 In 2008 Chung et Chen [159] studied the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Violet 5 
dye using TiO 2 as catalyst. The experiments were carried out in a quartz be aker. 0.08 g/L of 
TiO 2 were added to 300 ml of the dye solution (that had a concentration of 10 mg/L). 
Reactor was equipped with four Xenon 254 nm lamps. The effect of different variables 
(such as initial dye concentration (10 – 50 mg/L), pH (2 – 12), photo catalyst amount (0 – 
100 mg/L), UV light intensity) on the photo catalysis efficiency, was evalu ated. Due to the 
short degradation times (20 minutes for 90%  decolorization), it was conclu ded th at TiO 2 
photocatalysis could be used as an easy and efficient method to remove azo dyes from 
wastewater s. 
In 2011 Souza et al. [160] used Blue 5 G dye as a model pollutant to test some cerium -
titania -alumina -based nanocatalysts, modified with Ag and Fe, fo r photocatalytic 
application. They observed that decoloriza tion with the mixed oxide photocatalyst CeO 2-
TiO 2-Al2O3 gave a result similar to that of TiO 2 (96 % and 100 % respectively). They found 
that the addi tion of Ag and Fe to the mixed oxide increased t he decolorization and reaction 
rates of Reactive blue 5G dyes. The experiments were  carried out in cylindrical Pyre x cell 
having a volume of 500 mL. T he solution containing 70 ppm of Blue 5G dye was treated 
using 2 g/L of catalyst . An oxygen stream was bubbled into the suspension. A 125 W 
medium pressure mercury lamp was used for irradiation. To avoid the heating of the 
solution, the vessel was equipped with  a cooling  jacket.  
 
In the same year, Kavitha and Palanisamy [162] studied the  sonophotocatalytic degradation 
of Reactive Red (RR) 120 dye under visible light using dye sensitized TiO 2 activated by 
ultrasound. An immersion well photochemical reactor made of Pyrex glass, equipped with a 
water -circulating jacket and an opening for sup ply of oxygen , was used. Irradiations were 
carried out using a 50 W halogen lamp. A comparative study of photocatalysis and 
sonophotocatalysis using TiO 2, Hombikat UV -100 and ZnO was carried. ZnO was identified 
as the best catalyst. The order of activity  of the tested photocatalysts was ZnO > TiO 2 P-25 
> UV -100. 
Saggioro et al. (2011) [163] studied the photocatalytic degradation of two commercial azo 
dyes: Reactive Black 5 and Reactive Red 239. TiO 2 Degussa P -25 was used as catalyst . 
Photodegradation was ca rried out in a 100 m L aqueous solution irradiated  with a 125 W 
mercury vapo ur lamp. The effects of the catalyst concentration  (0.001 – 1 g/L), UV -light 
irradiation time (0 – 120 min), pH of the solution (2 – 10), initial concentration of the dyes 
(30 – 150 mg/L) and addition of different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0 – 6 · 10-2 31 
 mol/L) were investigated. Results showed that  the optimal amount of catalyst was 0.1 g/L. 
It was observed that the increase in the initial dye concentration lead  to a decrease in 
photodegradation. It was also demonstrated that RR5 and RR293 photodegradation was 
favored in acidic solution. The photodegradation of the mixture of the two dyes was also 
analysed. The results confirmed that TiO 2 had the same photocataly tic activity both in 
reaction with mono -component solutions and in reaction with bi -component solutions.  
In 2013, Cabansag et al. [164] studied the degradation of Reactive Violet 5 dye under UV 
light with bulk zinc oxide (ZnO) slurry as photocatalyst. A 10 W UV lamp , having UV 
emission peak at 365 nm , was used . A 1 L reaction vessel , immersed in a water bath with an 
inlet and outlet water pump system to maintain the desired temperature , was used. The 
effects of varying amount s of zinc oxide (0.65 – 5 g/L) , dye concentration (15 – 60 mg/L), 
exposure time (0 – 3 h), pH (3 – 10), temperature (30 – 70 °C) and lamp intensity (20 – 10 
W) on degradation efficiency, were evaluated . For low dye concentration (15 mg/L) results 
showed that UV enhanced the dye degradati on of about 90% immediately after 30 minutes 
of irradiation.  Moreover, the rate of dye degradation increased as the amount of zinc oxide 
increased until optimum loading was achieved.  
Many authors evaluated the difference between visible/UV illumination and  solar light 
illumination on the photocatalytic process efficiency. In 2002 Saquib et Muneer [165] 
investigated the photocatalytic degradation of Remazol Brilliant Blue B under sunlight and 
compared the results to those obtained by using an artificial light source. An immersion well 
photochemical reactor made of Pyrex glass was used. 250 m L of the desired solution was 
filled into the reactor and the required amount of photo catalyst was added. A  125 W 
medium pressure mercury lamp  was used as light source . IR radiation and short wavelength 
UV radiation were eliminated by a water jacket. When sunlight was used as light source, the 
experiments were performed  from  9.00 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. (during the winter season  in India ). 
The experiments were  carried out in roundbottom flasks (250 m L) made of Pyrex glass. 
Three different commercially available p hotocatalysts were tested: Degussa P -25, Hombikat 
UV-100 and PC -500. The effect of the pH (3 - 11), the init ial dye concentration (80 – 330 
mg/L) and the catalyst concentration (0.5 – 5 g/L), on the process efficiency, was evaluated. 
It was found that Degu ssa P -25 worked better under UV light, and Hombikat UV -100 
worked better under sunlight than other photocatalysts.  
In 2005 Liu et al. [166] studied the photocatalytic degradation of three azo dyes, Acid 
Orange 7 (AO7), Procion Red MX -5B (MX -5B) and Reacti ve Black 5 (RB5) using 
nitrogen -doped TiO 2 nanocrystals prepared by a sol –gel method. Solar light and UV 32 
 radiations were used as energy sources. The UV light source was a 150 W high -pressure 
mercury lamp. Experiments were carried out in Petri dishes with 1 0 cm diame ter. Each Petri 
dish contained  15 ml of dye and TiO 2 suspension. The e xperiments were carried out  to 
compa re the photocatalytic activity of N -doped TiO 2 to Degussa P -25 under exposure to UV 
radiations and solar light. Results showed  that the N-doped TiO 2 exhibited substantial 
photocatalytic activity under sunlight irradiation  (70% of color removal  was found after  1 
hour and complete decolo rization was achieved within 3 h ours), whereas Degussa P -25 and 
pure TiO 2 nanoparticles did not give good r esults as the N -doped TiO 2. 
In 2013 C hatzysmeon et al. [167] examin ed the photocatalytic treatment of two synthetic 
textile dyehouse effluents. The first one (SE1) was a Remazol Black B aqueous solution 
(159 mg/L of dye)  and the second one (SE2) was an aqu eous mixture of sixteen dyes and 
auxiliary chemicals, usually  employed in the textile industry. TiO 2 (Degussa P -25) was used 
as catalyst. Different light sources were employed to evaluate the influence of the type of 
radiation on the photocatalytic process. Radiation was provided by:  
 
 a 9 W UVA lamp;  
 a 400 W high pressure mercury lamp;  
 a 150 W solar simulator system.  
 
It was found  that UVA radiation was better than the solar one. This was due to the fact that 
TiO 2 could  be activated at wavelengths below about 385 nm (in the UV region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum). Solar radiation consists of only about 5% of UVA radiation, 
while  the rest illuminates in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It was also 
found that increasing the catalyst concentration in the range 0.5 - 4 g/L, generally enhanced 
the decolorization and mineralization of SE1 and SE2 because more active sites on the 
photocatalyst surface were available for reactions.  
In 2014 Khanna and Shetti [168] synthesized Ag core –TiO 2 shell (Ag@TiO 2) structured 
nanoparticles with Ag to TiO 2 molar ratio of 1:1.7. The photocatalytic activity  of Ag@TiO 2 
photocatalyst  was compared to those of other catalysts such as TiO 2 and Ag -doped TiO 2 
based on the degradation of Reactive Blue 220  dye. A 50 mg/L solution at  pH 3  was treated 
under exposure to  UV and solar light irradiations. A 250 mL capacity borosilicate glass 
beaker  was used as reactor. It was equipped with two 18 W UV lamps (wavelength, ʎ = 365 
nm), which were placed vertically, specified to radiate 80% UV A and 20% UV B light. Solar 
experiments were carried out  in an open terrace. A photocatalyst concentration of 1 g /L was 33 
 used. It was found that Ag@TiO 2 exhibited better photocatalytic activity than Degussa P -25 
TiO 2, synthesized TiO 2, and Ag -doped TiO 2 photocatalysts.  
In 2015 Samsudin et al. [169] studied the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Blue 4 
(RB4), using  pure anatase nano titanium (IV) oxide (TiO 2). The experiments were  carried 
out in a 750 mL borosilicate -glass cylindrical photochemical reactor. The RB4 solution (100 
mL) containing the appropriate quantity of TiO 2 was irradiated by a mercury lamp (25, 70 , 
125 and 400 W), a visible lamp (400 W) and natural sunlight. The effect of the pH (3 - 13), 
the init ial dye concentration (20 – 100 mg/L), the catalyst concentration (0.25 – 1.25 g/L), 
the hydrogen peroxide concentration (0 – 1 g/L) and the light intensi ty on the process 
efficiency, was evaluated. Results showed  that the dye could be  completely degraded and 
the addition of hydrogen peroxide enhanced the photodegradation efficiency.  
In 2017 Thamaraiselvi and Sivakumar [170] synthesized three types of catal ysts: SrTiO 3 
nanocube, three dimensional, mesoporous, BiOBr catalysts, and SrTiO 3/BiOBr 
heterojunction catalysts, respectively, by sol -gel, precipitation, and impregnation methods. 
SrTiO 3/BiOBr heterojunction catalysts were synthesized by using different w eight 
percentage s (5, 10, 30, 50 70 %) of SrTiO 3. The catalysts w ere used for the degradation of 
Reactive Blue 198, Reactive Black 5 and Reactive Yellow 145 in the presence of visible and 
solar light. The photocatalytic degradation of the three dyes was car ried out in an immersion 
type visible reactor equipped with a 500 W tungsten lamp (420 nm), and a water  circulation 
system to avoid the thermal decolourization. The experiments under solar light were 
performed in a n open terrace. Among the catalysts, the o ne containing a SrTiO 3 weight 
percentage of 10 %, gave the best results. It was also observed that solar light was  better than 
visible light due to the presence of 4% of UV light in the solar radiation.  
Other authors used only the solar light: Neppolian et al. (2002) [171] investigated the 
mineralization of an aqueous solution containing Reactive Blue 4 by using TiO 2 as 
photocatalyst. A cylindrical photo chemical reactor, with an internal volume of 200 mL, 
made up of borosilicate glass was used. S olar light w as used as the energy source for 
cataly st excitation. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature. The effect of the 
initial concentration of dye on the reaction rate was analysed by varying the initial dye 
concentration from 64 to 320 mg/L with cons tant catalyst loading (2 g/L). A series of 
experiments were carried out to find the influence of other  parameters, such as catalyst 
loading (1 –4 g/L), pH (3 –13), concentration of hydrogen peroxide (4.4 · 10-3–2.6 · 10-2), 
potassium persulphate (0.25 –2 g/L), sodium carbonate (0.25 –2 g/L), and sodium chloride 
(0.25 –2 g/L) on the process efficiency. It was found that the dye molecules were completely 34 
 degraded to CO 2, SO 42− , NO 3 , NH 4+ and H 2O under solar irradiation. Results showed  that 
the addition of hydrogen peroxide and potassium persulphate influenced the 
photodegradation efficiency: a  faster photodegradation of dye intermediates was observed in 
the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The auxiliary chemicals such as sodium carbonate  and 
sodium chloride also influenced the photodegradation efficiency.  
In 2006 Muruganandham et al. [211] studied the photocatalytic oxidative degradation of 
Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) using TiO 2 P25 as photocatalyst in slurry form and sunlight as 
irradiation source. The experiments were carried out from  11 a.m. to 2  p.m. in the months of 
May–June. An open borosilicate glass tube of 50 mL capacity, 40 cm height and 20 mm 
diameter , was used as the r eaction vessel. Irradiation was carried out in the open air . The 
solution was  continuously aerated by a pump to provide oxygen and ensure  the complete 
mixing of the reaction solution. The degradation was carried out at different experimental 
conditions to optimize the parameter s such as amount of catalyst (1 –3 g/L), ini tial 
concentration of dye (71.5 –214–357–500-634) and pH (3 –5–7– 9). Different types of 
photocatalysts (ZnO, SnO 2, CdS, Fe 2O3, ZnS, TiO 2 P25) were tested. This study revealed 
that RB 5 could be  completely degraded by in the presence of TiO 2 Degussa  P-25 and under 
exposure to  solar light irradiation . Results showed that t he optim al concentrat ion of the 
catalyst was 2 g/L. I t was found that the complete degradation of the 357 mg/L dye solution 
under solar irradiation required 3.5 h. Finally, t he photochemical degradation in the presence 
of hydrogen peroxide resulted in the partial removal of the dye.  
In 2012 Giwa et al. [172] studied the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Yellow 81 
(RY81) and R eactive Violet 1 (RV1) in the presence of  TiO 2 Degussa P -25 and sunlight 
irradiation.  A 100 mL solution  of each dye was prepared and transferred into a 500 mL 
Pyrex beaker for solar irradiation. Before the solar irradiation, the catalyst was added to the 
solution. The effects of various parameter s such as catalyst loading (0.5 –2 g/L), pH (3 –11), 
and initi al concentration of the dye (10 –100 mg/L) on the photocatalytic efficiency  were 
evaluat ed. The effects of various photocatalysts such as TiO 2 Degussa P -25, TiO 2 (anatase), 
and ZnO on decolorization were also investigated. It was found that TiO 2-P25 and ZnO are 
more efficient than TiO 2 (anatase). In the presence of Degussa P - 25 decolorization yields of 
92% and 85%, for Reactive Yellow 81 and  Reactive Viole t 1, respectively,  were obtained 
in 20 minutes.  
In 2013 Subash et al. [212] prepared different wt % of Zr -codoped Ag−ZnO catalysts by a 
simple precipitation−thermal decomposition method .  The catalyst were  used for the  
degradation of Reactive Red 120 (RR 1 20) under natural sunlight. The photocatalytic 35 
 activity of 4 wt % Zr -codoped Ag−ZnO was compared to that of other single -metal -doped, 
undoped, and commercial catalysts. The influence of operational parameters such as  the 
amount of photocatalyst (2 –6 g/L), dye concentration, and initi al pH (3 –5–7–9–11) on the 
photocatalytic process was evaluate d. The experiments were carried out on sunny days 
between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. An open borosilicate glass tube of 50 mL capacity, 40 cm 
height, and 20 mm diameter , was used as  reaction vessel . 50 mL of RR 120 (294 mg/L)  
were used . Reaction mixture was  continuous ly aerat ed by a pump to provide oxygen and to 
ensure complete mixing of the solution. Results showed  that Zr−Ag−ZnO was more 
efficient in RR 120 degradation than  the other catalysts. The photocatalytic efficiency of 
Zr−Ag−ZnO was also tested with other dyes such as Reactive Orange 4 (RO 4) and 
Reactive Yellow 84 (RY 84) , and good results were obtained.  
In the same year, Badawy et al. [173] prepared pure and silve r doped ZnO thin films over a 
glass substrate using a sol –gel spincoating method. Prepared films were calcined at different 
temperatures. Photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared films was e valuated by the 
decolorization of three azo reactive dyes,  Reacti ve Red 195, Reactive yel low 145 and 
Reactive orange 122, under solar light irradiation.  Various operational parameter s such as 
pH of the solution (3 –11) and initial concentration of the dye (10–25 ppm) were 
investigated. 75 mL  of 10 ppm dye solution was pl aced in a glass Petri dish. A catalyst of 
rectangular geometry 1.2 · 2.6 cm was immersed in the dye solution. It was found that Ag -
doped -ZnO (6 % wt. Ag) showed the highest photocatalytic activity . The optimal pH value 
was the natural pH of the studied dye s. 
Chen et al. [140] published in 2005 the first artic le regarding the use of UV‐LEDs. T hey 
used the UV‐LEDs as alternative source s of light for the oxidation of perchloroethylene 
(PCE). Then, many articles about the use of UV and visible LEDs in the photocatalytic 
processes to treat aqueous organic dyes such as methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB), 
malachite green (MG), reactive re d 22 (RR‐22), methyl orange (MO), congo red (CR), and 
Reactive B lack 5 (RB‐5), were published. Here, the studies  about  the photocatalytic 
degradation of different dyes under UV and visible LEDs  irradiation were summarize d.  
Wang et al. (2006) [173] success fully used UV‐LEDs for the photocatalytic mineralization 
of Reactive Red 22. TiO 2 was used as  photocatalyst. A rectangular planar fixed‐film reactor 
in recirculation mode was used. V arious operative conditions such as  initial dye 
concentration (10 - 100 mg/ L), and different TiO 2 coating arrangements  were  investigated. It 
was found that Reactive Red 22 could be treated, with good results, trough photocatalytic 
process.  36 
 Many researchers used methylene blue as model pollutant in water to test the photocatalytic 
activity of commercial and synthesized catalyst s under UV -LED s irradiation [175 -177, 141 -
148].  
In 2009, Tayade et al. [175,145,146] realized a simple photocatalytic set up using five 
UV‐LEDs for the deco lorization and mineralization of Methylene Blue and Rhodamine B. 
The photocatalyst (Degussa  P-25) nanoparticles were suspended in the dye solution and 
irradiated with UV‐LEDs. It was also investigated T he effects of operational parameters 
such as the amoun t of the photocatalyst, the dye concentration, the pH, and the amount of 
hydrogen peroxide on the decolo rization and mineralization of m ethylene b lue was 
evaluated . It was  used A methylene blue  concentration of 3.12 · 10–5 mol/L  and a rhodamine 
B concentra tion of 2.08  · 10−5 mol/L were used for the experiments. Results showed that for 
the methylene blue the optimal conditions were the following:  
 1.2 g/L of catalyst;  
 3.12×10–5mol/L of dye;  
for the r hodamine B the optimal condition  were : 
 1.6 g/L;  
  6.26×10–5 mol/L;  
 pH = 3.05.  
Sacco et al. [104] used white and blue LEDs as visible light irradiation sources for the 
photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and methyl orange in aqueous solution. N -
doped TiO 2 nanoparticles (having a bandgap varying between 2.6 eV and 3.3 eV) were 
synthesized by the direct hydrolysis of titanium alkoxide with ammonia, and used as 
photocatalysts. The  photoreactor was equipped with a strip composed of 30 white light 
LEDs (wavelen gth of emission: 400 – 800 nm) with a nominal power of 6 W. A strip of 30 
blue light LEDs (wavelength of emission: 400 –550 nm) having a nominal power of 6 W  was 
also used . The LED s strips  were covered on the outside of the reactor to ensure uniform 
light exposure of the reaction mixture. The N -doped TiO 2 showed high photocatalytic 
activity, therefore it  was also used to treat methyl orange . Results confirm ed the high 
photocatalytic  efficiency of the N -doped TiO 2 [145, 146].  
Dai et al. [143, 148, 178] also u sed methylene blue to test a plasmonic Ag/AgBr 
heterostructure as photocatalytic material . A LED device (wavelength: 450 nm)  was used as 
light source . A vessel containing 100 mL of methylene blue  (10 mg/L ) and 0.05 g of the 
photocatalyst  was used as photor eactor. Experiments were carried out at room temperature. 
The distance between the LED light source and the reactor was 1 cm; the reaction mixture 37 
 was stirred continuously during the photocatalysis. It was  observed a 95% methylene blue 
dye decomposition over 240 min [143].  
Repo et al. [142] synthesized CdS microspheres by a hydrothermal method . The catalyst 
was used  for the photocatalytic treatment  of some dyes under  LED s light irradiation . 
Methylene blue, phenol red, and methyl red were exposed to different LED s lights 
(wavelengths: 405 and 450 nm). The nominal power of the near‐UV LED s was 24 W and it 
was 17.5 W for the blue LED. A dye concentration of 3 –5 mg/L was used. Results showed 
the complete decolor ization of each dyes occurred within 3 h ours. 
Repo et al. also tested the photocatalytic activity of  other CdS nanoparticles having different 
sizes. The photocatalytic dec olorization  of methylene blue dye in the presence of blue LEDs 
(3 W) and solar light was investigated. It was  found that smaller nanostructures enhanced 
photocatalytic efficiency. The photocatalytic activity of CdS was compared to that of  
commercial TiO 2 (under exposure to blue LED s light).  It was  found that CdS w as more 
efficient  than TiO 2.  
Eskandari et al. (2013) [177] used cadmium sulphide nanostructures synthesized via 
chemical precipitation method by using MEA as capping agent. The photocatalytic activities 
of the samples were investigated for degradation of methylene blue (MB) under blue LED s 
(3 W) and solar light irradiation. For comparison purposes , TiO 2 Degussa P -25 was used as 
the reference photocatalyst. The reaction experiments were carried out in 100 m L 
round bottom  flask. T he reaction mixture was prepared by adding 1 g/ L of the  CdS 
nanopowder to 50 mL  of a MB aqueous solution (15 mg/L). It was found that under blue 
LED s irradiation, the CdS exhibited higher photocatalytic efficiency than the commercial 
Degussa P -25 TiO 2.  
Kuo et al. (2010) [179] used nitrogen -modified TiO 2 photo catalyst (N -doped TiO 2) obtained 
by a simple hydrolysis method for the photodecolorization of methyl blue (MB) and direct 
blue 86 (DB -86) under various visible light sources : fluorescent lamp and blue LED s lamp . 
TiO 2 was used  as the reference photocatalyst . Each test, was carried out  the in the presence 
of 1 g/L of photocatalyst added to 200 mL  of a dye aqueous  solution (10 mg/L). Results 
showed that the f luorescent lamp /N-doped TiO 2 system  was more efficient than the  blue 
LED s lamp/ TiO 2 one. The effect of the pH on the process efficiency was also evaluated. 
High decolo rization yields  were achieved at pH 5 and 7.   
Jo et al. (2014) [ 242] used blue and ultraviolet LEDs for the degradation of malachite green 
(MG) dye . A slurry type spiral -shape d photocatalytic reactor and Degussa  P-25  TiO 2 
photocatalyst were employed . The influence of operational parameters such  as catalyst 38 
 concentration (0.2 –0.7 g/L), i nitial concentration of dye (10 –40 mg/L), and pH (3 –9) of the 
medium was evaluated  to optimiz e MG dye degradation.  
Results showed that the photocatalytic degradation of malachite green dye under separate 
irradiation by blue and by ultraviolet LED was nearly the same ( ∼76%). It was also 
observed that the adsorption of malachite green dye o n TiO 2 surface enhanced 
photocatalytic degradation under blue LED irradiation.  
 
The photocatalytic processes in the presence of the  traditional UV sources (such as mercury 
lamps) were largely investigat ed, and TiO 2 was often used as ca talyst. Most recentl y, studies 
on the use of other sources of light, less expensive than the UV one, were  carried out. 
Anyway, t hese light sources necessitate to be used with opportunely modified 
photocatalysts, therefore , researches focused on the development of new photocat alysts. The 
efficiency of these catalyst was tested using industrial dyes as model pollutants. Many 
studies showed  that visible light LEDs can successfully be used for the photocatalytic 
decomposition of various dyes such as methilene blue, malachite green , Direct Blue 86, by 
employing photocatalysts with a bandgap in the range of 2.0 –3.1 eV. Anyway there are few 
papers regarding the photocatalysis of reactive dyes under exposure to  visible LEDs.  
 
 
2.3 Parameters  affecting photocatalytic process  
The analysis regarding the  state of art of the photocatalytic processes also evidenced that 
this type of treatment s could  be influenced by a lot of parameters such as type of dye, dye 
concentration, catalyst loading, light sources, pH, amount of  hydrogen perox ide and 
aeration.  
 
 
2.3.1 Influence of Dye Type on the Photocatalytic Process  
The chemical structure of the organic dyes has a considerable effect on the reactivity of dyes 
on photodegradation system [186]. This effect was investigated by different researchers. For 
example, Khataee and Kasiri (2010) [187] found that the  COD removal rate of Reactive 
Yellow 17 was higher than Reactive Red 2 and Reactive Blue 4 dyes. This results was  
attributed  to the particular structures of the three molecules of dyes. R eactive Yellow 17 and 
Reactive Red 2 are provided with an azo group ( –N=N –) which makes these dyes easy to 39 
 degrade, while in RB4 there is the anthraquinonic group that makes this dye mor e resistant 
to photodegradation.  
TiO 2 photocatalisys can be successfully used to treat Reactive Orange 16, Reactive Black 5 
and Reactive Blue 4. The reaction rate follows the subsequent order: RO16 > RB4 > RB5. 
The reason can depend on the different chemical structure of dyes that implies differ ent 
adsorption characteristics and propensity to photodegradation [188 - 191]. In fact , Reactive 
Black 5 has a more complex structure than Reactive Orange 16 and Reactive Blue 4 that 
makes it mo re difficult to treat. Moreover, Reactive Black 5 tends to abs orbe light photons 
causing a decrease of photons useful for the generation of hydroxyl radicals: dye molecules 
adsorb light and photons cannot reach the photocatalyst surface; thus, the photodegradation 
efficiency decreases. Moreover, it can be observe d that different dyes can follow different 
degradation pathway s; it is due to their different chemical structures and fu nctional groups. 
For example, an  ·OH radical who attacks an aromatic ring (of a dye molecule) can generate 
a hydrogen  atom [192 - 196]. In t he case of hydroxy azo dyes (A cid Orange 7 and A cid 
Orange 8) a competition between an oxygen atom in the azo form or in the hydrazone form 
and ∙OH radical  occurs. Oxygen tends to abstract a hydrogen atom from the dye molecules, 
whereas ∙OH radical tends to add it -self on a phenyl or naphtyl nucleous [197].  
A dye can have different functional groups such as nitrite group, alkyl side chain, chloro 
group, carboxylic group, sulfonic substituent, and also hydroxyl group [187], thus  the 
catalyst necessitate  to be chosen on the base  of the characteristic group of the dye [198 -201]. 
There are some groups, such as the alkyl side chain, that could reduce the water solubility of 
the molecules causing a slowing down of the photodegradation process.  This explains 
becau se the rate of decomposition decreases with increasing  length of the side cha in and, 
consequently, with increasing hydrophobicity of the dye molecule.  
This is the case of the Reactive Bl ue 19 [198 -202], in  fact ∙OH radical, that should degrade 
the dye chro mophore, could react with the hydrogen atoms of the side chains; therefore the 
absorbance doesn’ t decrease.   
A considerable decrease of the photocatalytic decolorization rate was observed when two or 
three chloro substituents were present on the phenyl ri ng of a pyrazolone dye [203, 204]. 
The comparison of Acid Yellow 17 and Acid Y ellow 23 decolorization rates suggests that 
the difficulty of the dye to be degraded directly depends on the number of electron 
withdrawing chloro groups in the molecule.  
Another efficient withdrawing group is the –SO 3− one. The difficulty to degrade Orange G 
and Aizarin S depends on the presence of this group in the two dyes molecules [205], 40 
 whereas the high d ecolorizati on yields  achieved by Methyl  Red photocatalysis is due to the 
presence of the carboxylic group.  Dyes contain ing more sulfonic substituents are less 
reactive in a photocatalytic process, while hydroxyl group intensifies the electron resonance 
in the molecule and the degradation rate of the dye [206].  
Finally, p hotocatalytic decolori zation of monoazo dyes is easier than anthraquinone 
degradation.  
 
 
2.3.2 Dye concentration  
The initial dye concentration can influence  the photodegradation process based upon two 
main aspects.  
In Table 2.1 the effect of the initial concentration of dye on the degradation (%) of Reactive 
Blue 4 , is shown [171].  
 
 
Table 2.1 – Influence of the concentration of the dye on the Reactive Blue 4 degradation. 
Catalys t loading (2 g/L), energy source: solar light [171].  
  
Concentration of the dye (mg/L)  Degradation (%)  
64 98 
127 98 
191 82 
255 71 
319 32 
 
Table 2.1 shows that the percentage degradation decreases as the initial concentration of the 
dye increases. One of the reasons is that i n high dye concentrations, more active sites of the 
catalyst may be  covered with dye ions. Therefore, the water molecules cannot react with the 
hole generated on the catalyst surface and this  may lead to the decrease in  the production of 
·OH radicals on the  catalyst  surface.  Furthermore, the path length of the photons  entering the 
solution decreases as the initial concentration of  dye increases. This is due to the “shadow 
effect” : the dye molecules hinder the penetration of light radiation through the solution, and 
therefore, the production of HO · radicals, which are the most reactive species, decreases 
[170, 156, 169, 177].  41 
 Several studies reported the heterogeneous photocatalysis of reactive dyes; generally, the 
concent ration of the treated dye was varied from 20  mg/L to 100 mg/L. In these studies the 
optimal dye concentration to avoid the shadow effect was found to be  about 50 mg/L [154, 
155, 157, 161, 170,  171, 172, 204].  
 
 
2.3.3  Catalyst loading  
The amount of catalyst to be used is o ne of the main factors to evaluate , it’s also important  
to keep the treatment expenses low for industrial use. To avoid using an excessive amount 
of catalyst, its optimal concentration has to be determined.  
The amount of catalysts required depend s on the configuration of the reactor, light intensity, 
type of the targeted dye and  type, as well as particle morphology , of the catalyst.  Because of 
these many contributing factors , there  are inconsistencies in the optimum catalyst 
concentration  used by  different researchers .  
Kaur and Singha (2007) [235]  reported that in all of the optimized conditions  of efficiency, 
the catalyst dose for maximum photocatalytic  degradation o f Reactive Red 198 was 0.3 g/L.  
However, in another  study, the optimized condition for TiO 2 consumption was  stated to be 
0.5 g/L [239]. Also, Muruganandham  et al.  (2004) [229]  reported that an increase of catalyst 
weight from 1.0 to  4.0 g/L increases the dye decolourization sharply from 69.27%  to 
95.23% at 60 minu tes and dye degradation from 74.54% to  97.29% at 150 min utes.  
Other  authors [207, 208] studied the variation of the reaction rate by varying the catalyst 
concentration: in all cases, the total active surface area increase d with increasing catalyst 
dosage,  but, for catalyst concentrations higher than the optimal value, both steric 
encumbrance problems and problems related to the penetration o f light through the solution, 
took over. As a result, the photoactivated volume of suspension decrease d.  
It can be said that for dye concentrations higher than 100 mg/L the catalyst concentration to 
be used varies from 1 to 4 g/L. F or dye concentrations lower than 100 mg/L the catalyst 
concentration is comprised between 0.25 and 1 -1.5 g/L.  
 
 
2.3.4  pH 
The wastewater from textile industries usually has a wide range of pH values. It is important 
to study the influence of pH on  the degradation of dye. The pH  can in fluence dye  adsorption 
onto the catalyst  surface  [230]  because the  semiconductor  surface  charge depends on the pH 42 
 of the given solution.  Zhu et al.  [234] demonstrated that pH effect could be explained on  the 
basis of point of zero charge (PZC)  of the used catalyst . The point of zero charge  for TiO 2 
particles is pH pzc 6.8.  At  pH values lower t han pHpzc (pH < 6.8) or at acidic conditions , the 
surface of the catalyst  is positively charged and at pH values greater than 6.8 the surface of 
TiO 2 is negatively charged according to the eq uations:  
 
TiOH (surface)       + H+       →        TiOH 2(surface)+                                                                   (2.1)  
 
TiOH (surface)      + OH-      →        TiO 2(surface)-   +    H 2O                                                     (2.2)  
 
The equations (2.1) and (2.2) show that, w hen pH is lower than the PZC value , the 
adsorbent  surface is positively charged and the surface becomes anions attracting/cations 
repelling.  Above PZC the surface is  negatively charged and it is cation s attracting/anion s 
repelling.  Zhu et al.  (2000) [234] found  that highest yield  of decolorization  of methyl orange  
was at pH 2 . They attributed this result to the electrostatic  attraction between the positively 
charged catalyst surface  and methyl orange anions, which increase d the  degree  of adsorption  
and led to  97% photodecolorization. However, the dye treatment results cannot be explained 
only on the base of dye adsorption strength  on the catalyst surface,  because there are many 
other parameters operating at the same time.  For example, Muruganandham et al.  (2004) 
[229] found that  increasing pH from 1 to 9 increased decolourization rates for  Reactive 
Orange 4 (an anionic dye) from 25.27% to 90.49% a fter only 40 min utes. Moreover , the 
faster rate of color  removal  was observed at alkaline pH. In contrast,  the degradat ion studies 
of some azo dyes showed con flicting  results [215].  For example, for the A cid Yellow 17 
(an anionic dye) the highest degradation value was obtained  at pH 3, whereas, for the 
Orange II (anionic  dye) and Amido B lack 10  B (anionic dye) the maximum  degradation 
yields were found at pH 9 [236].  
For a 200 mL solution containing 318 mg/L of Reactive Blue 4, treated using 2.5 g/L of 
TiO 2 and exposed to sunlight, the optimal pH was found to be  comprised between 5 and 10 
[155]. For the same dye,  Zhou et al. (2008) [214] found that the optimal pH was 11, but 
they used a different dye concentration (20 ppm), a different catalyst (ZnO and N -doped Zn) 
and a different catalyst loading (0.1 g/L). In other studies, it was found that the optimal pH 
was that corre sponding to the is oelectric point of the catalyst [154, 155, 158, 161 , 166, 170, 
171, 172, 173, 207].  In other studies, the experiments were carried out at acidic conditions 
[82, 157, 161, 162, 168, 171, 179].  (For example, f or a solution containing 30 mg/ L of 43 
 Reactive Re d 198 treated by using Tytanpol -A11 and Degussa P -25 under UV -visible light , 
the optimal pH was about 2;  therefore  the TiO 2 surface was positively charged and more 
reactive to the anionic dye  [238]).  
Therefore, t o evaluate  the influence of pH on a photocatalytic p rocess it is necessary to test 
different pH values , but it is also important to consider which characteristics of the dye and 
of the catalyst should be employed.  
 
 
2.3.5  Concentration of hydrogen peroxide  
The photo assisted degradation of organic substrates can be significantly improved in the 
presence of hydrogen peroxide. Since reactive hydroxyl radicals are easily generated by the 
breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction mi xture 
will play  a key role in the photocatalytic process [209]. It was widely reported that the 
addition of small amount of hy drogen peroxide greatly enhanced  the oxidation of organic 
pollutants mediated by TiO 2 catalyst [209].  
Hydrogen peroxide can react  directly with the electrons present in the conduction band of 
the catalyst, to form the radi cal ·OH (Eq. (2.1)), but also with the superoxide radical anion, 
producing hydroxyl radicals indirectly ( Eq. (2.2)) [210] ). It can also dimerize (Eq. (2.3)) 
and f orm others hydroxyl radicals.  
 
H2O2 + e-→ •OH + OH-                                                                                                      (2.1)  
 
H2O2+ O2-•→ •OH + OH- + O 2                                                                                          (2.2)  
 
H2O2   →  2 •OH                                                                                                                  (2.3)  
 
When the concentration  of hydrogen peroxide is too high, reactions involving HO• radicals  
could occur . These reactions could compete with those of degradation of the dye (Eq uations 
(2.4), (2.5) and (2.6)) and could reduce the colour degradation yields.  
 
H2O2  +  •OH →  HO 2•  +  H2O                                                                                          (2.5)  
 
HO 2• +  •OH →  H2O  +  O2                                                                                                (2.6)         
 44 
 2.3.6  Aeration  
Aeration can influence a photocatalytic process. In  fact, different studies regarding the effect 
of UV -vis illumination and simultaneous UV -vis illumination and aeration on the 
decolori zation of a dye solution, were reported in literature. Figure 2.2 shows  the influence 
of the aeration on the photolysis of Reactive Red 198 , Acid Black 1 and Acid Blue 7.  
 
 
Figure 2.1  - Photocatalytic decomposition of RR198, AB1 and AB7 under  
UV/Vis illumination and under illumination and simultaneous aeration at  
pH = 2 [82].  
 
Figure 2.2 shows  that simultaneous irradiation and aeration caused an increase of the degree 
of the dye decomposition indicating a possible role of an active oxygen species. After 40 
min of UV/Vis illumination and aeration, dyes decomposition degrees were 24.2% for 
RR198, 13.7% for AB1 and 7.2% for AB7 , respectively .  
In a photocatalytic system c ontinuous aeration of the dye solution can be ensured by a 
pump . Aeration is also useful to ensure the complete mixing of the reaction solution. [154, 
155, 165, 170, 204, 207].  
 
 
2.3.7  Type of light source: LEDs vs. conventional UV irradiation sources  
The light source that must be used it is very important. Conventional irradiation sources, 
such as mercury UV lamps, sunlight, or new irradiation sources such as LED lamps  can be 
45 
 employed . Conventional mercury UV lamps are delicate, contain mercury, have a short  
working life -span of about 100 –1000 h ours and tend to lose gas. Moreover, lamp -blasts are 
possible in med ium and high pressure lamps. An other disad vantage is that the operating 
temperature of medium/high pressure UV lamps is between 600 and 900 °C and they need 
to be cooled during the reaction. This increases the energy consumption.  
LEDs (both UV and visible) are robust, safe, compact, cool, non‐tox ic, inexpensive, 
environmentally friendly and have a long life‐span of around 100000 h. Moreover, LEDs 
can emit light at different wavelengths. This depends on the composition and condition of 
the semiconducting materials [139].  
 
 
2.3.7 .1 Advantages of LEDs  
LEDs don’t  require cooling, they are small, and can be used in different types of 
photocatalytic reactor set‐ups. Furthermore, LED s irradiation is unidirectional, so the loss of 
light is lower than that of traditional UV light lamps (reactors employin g traditional UV 
irradiation sources can waste up to 80% of the light that they produce). Conversely, LEDs 
emit light at specific wavelengths, and the light emitted is completely used. Based on the 
available literature, it is clear that increasing the numb er and the power of the available 
LEDs  will ensure a better photocatalytic degradation of dyes in shorter reaction time.

Photocatalytic degradation of Reactive dyes 
under visible light  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1 Introduction  
The aim of this work is the study of the photo catalytic decolorization of a reactive dye under 
exposure to visible light. Reactive Blue 4, Reactive Red 120 and Reactive Violet 5, which 
are dyes with high structural complexity, were used as model pollutants. The photocatalytic 
process was carried out in a cylindrical  photoreactor . The solution, containing the catalyst as 
an aqueous suspension , was irradiated under  visible  blue LEDs .  
Before using Reactive Violet 5, the photodecolorization of Reactive Blue 4 and Reactive 
Red 120  was examin ed.  
At first, Reactive Blue 4 and Reactive Red 120 dyes were used as model pollutants. 
However results obtained with Reactive Blue 4 showed the same c olour removal yields in 
the pre sence and in the absence of photocatalysts.  Reactive Red 120 showed a hi gh 
resista nce not only to the photolysis, but also to the photocatalytic treatments.  
Therefore, Reactive Violet 5 dye was selected to carry out the experiments. Results showed 
that it couldn’t be treated only by photolysis, but also trough a ph otocatalytic process. To 
find the most suitable catalytic system, different catalysts, were tested. Then , the e ffect of 
various operational pa rameters like catalyst loading, pH and addition of hydrogen peroxide,  
was studied to find  the optimized conditions  for maximum de coloriza tion.  
The existence of an optimal catalyst concentration, an optimum pH , and H 2O2 dosage,  was 
observed. Under the optimal  conditions,  complete decolorization of the Reactive Violet 5 
dye was achieved in less than 2 hours.

Table 3.2 shows that the typical band gap of undoped TiO 2 is 3.2  eV. This value decreases 
to 2.5 eV for the N -doped TiO 2 due to the presence of nitrogen in the crystal structure phase. 
The band gap energies of Fe -TiO 2 (10 mg Fe), Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe) and Fe -TiO 2 (100 mg 
Fe) are 3.12, 2.9 and 2.63 eV, respectively. As the  iron content increases, the band gap 
decreases, and the catalyst becomes  able t o absorb  the visible light.  
XRD analysis (not reported) [104, 154 ] revealed that for  the undoped TiO 2, the N-TiO 2 and 
the Fe-TiO 2 samples , the only  crystalline phase is the anatase and it did not change after the 
doping process.   
The crystallite s average size is reported in Table 3.3.

Degussa P -25.  
The XRD analysis are confirmed by Raman  spectra ( not reported ), since the band positions  
(at 141, 194, 394, 515 and 636 cm-1) are in complete  accordance with those reported in 
previous studies for  anatase powder [252, 253 ].

3.3.1  UV/VIS Spectroscopy  
The UV/Vis spectrophotometer is used to measure the absorbance of light of a chemical at a 
given wavelength. The value of the absorbance is proportional to the chemical concentration 
(Beer Lambert law), so concentrations may be measured through absorbance measurements 
and a calibration curve.  
The spectrophotometer is composed of a light source, which can be an  incandescent bulb 
(visible wavelength) or a deuterium lamp (UV regions), a holder for the sample ( which is 
contained inside a 3.5 mL cuvette), a diffracting grating to separate lig ht in its different 
wavelengths  and a detector. The sample is contained in a transparent cuvette, generally of a 
1 cm width and 3.5 mL capacity. Cuvettes can be made of plast ic, glass or quartz, which are 
the highest quality ones. The plastic and glass cuvettes are common if used in visible 
wavelengths, but are not suitable for the UV analysis, as they absorb in that region.

  = εlC                                                                                                                                (3.1)  
 
where ε is the molar extinction coefficient, l is cell path length (the d imension of the 
container, which  was 1 cm) and C  is the solute concentration.  
During the experiments, the absorbance of the treated solution was monitored. The  
absorbance value s were measured at the wavelength s of 595 nm, 510 nm and 559 nm, for 
the Reactive Blue 4, the Reactive Red 120 and the Reactive Violet 5, respectively.  
The absorbance values obtained were  used to calculate the corresponding concentrations 
through  calibrat ion curve s obtained  from solutions having  known concentrations.   
In Figures 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7, the concentrations of the calibration solutions and the 
corresponding absorbances are reported for each dye.

Figures 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 show  that the relationships between absorbance and concentration 
are linear in a wide range of values : [0 – 300] ppm for the  Reactive Blue 4; [0 – 100] for the

3.4 Experimental procedure  
The experiments were carried out  using a borosilicate glass cylindrical photoreactor (ID = 3 
cm, H = 18 cm) equipped with an ai r distributor device (Qair = 15  l/h (NTP) ) and a 
magnetic stirrer to maintain the photocatalyst suspended in the aqueous  solution. The 
photoreactor was irr adiated with a strip composed of  90 blue LEDs  with wavelength 
emission in the range 465 -470 nm (LEDTECH SHOP, Germany) . The l ight source was  
positioned around the external surface of the photoreactor.  Abs = 0,0179 · Concentration

 In a typical  photocatalytic test, a fixed catalyst concentration, was suspended in 50 mL 
solution. The system was left in the dark for 1 hour to reach the dye adsorption equilibrium 
on the catalyst surface, and then the reactor was irradiated with visible light. Liqui d samples 
were taken during the experiments and filtered to remove catalyst powders from the aqueous 
solution. The reaction was monitored in time, collecting the UV/vis spectra every 60 
minutes. 2.5 mL of the reagent solution was transferred inside a quart z 3 mL cuvette.  
The natural  pH: 
 
 of Reactive Blue 4 solution was 6.5;  
 of Reactive Red 120 solution was 6.8;  
 of Reactive Violet 5 solution was 7.22.  
 
At first pH was not modified. Then, to evaluate the effect of pH on decolorization rate, 
buffer solutions were used to keep the pH constant during the experiments.

 3.5 Kinetic modelling : Initial Rates Method  
The initial rates method  (IRM)  can be used  to estimate the initial rate of a reaction. Initial 
rates, like all reaction rates, are def ined as a change in concentration per unit time.  If only 
two data points are available, the initial rate can be calculated using the formula  below:  
 
             = (C2−C1)/( 2− 1)                                                                                            (3.5) 
 
C2 and C1 represent the concentrations (of a dye solution) corresponding to the times t1 and 
t2, respectively.  
When more data points are available, the initial rate can be determined more accurately from 
a graph of concentration vs. time:   
 
                                                                                                            (3.6)  
 
Since rate is defined as change in concentration per unit time, the initial rate can be defined 
as the absolute value of the slope of the earliest, reasonably -linear section of a concentr ation 
vs. time plot.

 3.6 Results and discussion  
3.6.1 Photolysis of Reactive Blue 4  
50 mL of a 100 ppm Reactive B lue 4 dye solution w ere irradiated with the blue LEDs strip  
in the absence of catalyst  for 3 hours . In Figure 3.9, the dye removal efficiency as a function 
of the irradiation time is showed.  
 
Figure 3.9 – Effect of blue LEDs on the Reactive Blue 4 decolorization, expressed as 
absorbance change at 595 nm (C RB4 = 100 ppm).  
 
During the first hour of irradiation, no colour removal was observed. Since the second hour 
of exposure to light LEDs, the A/A 0 ratio decreased linearly as a function of time. It was 
observed that after 180 minute s of photolysis  the degradation of dye was almost 17 % . 
Therefore, it was possible to decolorize a solution co ntaining the Reactive Blue 4 dye by 
means of a photolytic process, but to increase the colour degradation yields, a photocatalytic 
process is required . 
 
 
3.6.2 Photocatalyst selection  
To find the catalyst suitable to increase the Reactive Blue 4 colour removal, the 
decolorization  of a Reactive Blue 4  100 ppm solution was examined using different 
photocatalysts including TiO 2, N-doped TiO 2, Fe-TiO 2 (10 mg Fe), Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe) and 
Fe-TiO 2 (100 mg Fe). 1 g/L of catalyst was used in each test. After adding the catalyst, t he

 solution was left in the dark for 60 minutes to promote the adsorption of the molecules of 
dye on the surface of the catalyst n anoparticles.  
The decolorization efficiency, expressed as a function of the different catalysts and the 
irradiation time, is shown in Figure 3.10 and in Table 3.3, the colour removal values are 
reported.

evaluated at 60 and 180 minutes of irradiation (C RB4 = 100 ppm; C catalyst : 1 g/L).

 Figure 3.10 evidences that the colour removal i ncreased  as a function of time, in the absence 
and in the presence of c atalysts. This could mean  that the light source contributed  to the 
Reactive Blue 4 decolorization. Figure 3.10 also shows that the colour removal increase d 
when doped catalysts were used.  In fact,  the purpose of the doping is enhancing the 
photoefficiency of the catalyst .  
Figure 3.10  and Table 3.3 show  that the complete colour removal was never achieved. It 
was also observed that, for TiO 2/LEDs  system, the colour removal yields were about 4% 
and 25% after 60 and 180 minutes of irradiation, respectively. These results are very 
different from those found by Samsudin et al. (2015) [169]. They treated a Reactive Blue 4 
100 ppm dye solution using 1 g/L of  pure anatase nano -TiO 2 as catalyst and a 125 W UV 
light source. They found that the complete dye decolourization was achieved in 60 minutes. 
Using the TiO 2/LEDs system the colour removal was only 4% after one hour. These 
different results could be due to the different light sources used in the two cases.  
Table 3. 4 and Figure 3.10 also evidences that t he highest colour removal percentage was 
about 35 % and it was achieved in  180 minutes.  This result was achieved in the presence of  
Fe-TiO 2 (10 mg Fe)/LEDs and N -doped TiO 2/LEDs systems, respectively. At 60 minutes 
the colour removal percentage was slightly higher for the Fe -TiO 2 (10 mg Fe)/LEDs system 
than the N -doped TiO 2/LEDs on e (11.41% and 8.35 % respectively). For these reasons, Fe -
TiO 2 (10 mg Fe) could be the most suitable catalyst to treat the Reactive  Blue 4 dye, 
therefore it was selected to carry out this study.  
 
 
3.6.3 Effect of pH on Reactive Blue 4 decolor ization  
The effect of pH, on the Reactive Blue 4 photocatalysis with Fe -TiO 2 (10 mg Fe), was 
evaluated.  
At first, the pH was adjusted to the desired value  by addition of small amounts of NaOH and 
H2SO 4. However, as pH did not remain unchanged during the experiments, buffer solutions 
at pH 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 were used.  
In Figure 3.11 the colour removal efficiency (evaluated after 3 hours of ex posure to the blue 
LEDs) is shown as a function of pH.  
 59 
  
Figure 3.11 – Effect of pH on the Reactive Blue 4 colour removal evaluated at 180 minutes 
of irradiation (C RB4 = 100 ppm; Fe -TiO 2 (10 mg Fe) = 1 g/L; light source = BL).   
 
Figure 3.11 shows that as the pH was increased from 4 to 10, the colour removal also 
increased, whereas when the pH was increased from 10 to 12, the colour removal efficiency 
decreased. At pH 10 the colour removal percentage was the highest.  
In Table 3.5  the colour removal percentages, achieved in 180 minutes of irradiation, are 
reported as a function of pH.   
 
Table 3.5  – Reactive Blue 4 decolorization percentages, evaluated at 180 minutes of 
irradiation, as a function of pH (C RB4 = 100 ppm; Fe -TiO 2(10 mg  Fe) = 1 g/L; light source = 
BL).

 Table 3.5  shows that in each case the colour removal percentage was lower than 35.1 %, and 
only at pH 10 it was higher (about 42 %).  
Zhou et al. (2008) [214] observed a trend  similar  to the one shown in Figure 3.11 using the 
Reactive Blue 4 dye (Figure 3.12). They  used Nd - doped ZnO as catalyst and an UV lamp as 
light source and examin ed the effect of pH in the range 3 -13.  
 
Figure 3.12 - Reactive Blue 4 degradation rate under different solution pHs (C RB4 = 20 
ppm, V s = 100 mL; C catalyst  = 0.1 g/L) [214].  
 
Figure 3.12 shows that the rate of degradation  increase s rapidly as the solution pH increases 
up to 5 and increase s gradually above the solution pH of  7, and reache s a maximum value 
approximately at  pH 11. The photocatalytic degradation of Reactive  Blue 4 i s strongly 
favoured in alkaline pH.  According to Zhou et al. (2008) [214] t he zero point charge of ZnO 
is about 9 and, above this  value, the surface is negatively charged due to  adsorbed OH ⁻ ions. 
The presence of large quantities  of adsorbed OH ⁻ ions on the particle surface favo urs the 
formation of ·OH radicals, which are the primary oxidizing species responsible for 
degradation.  The decrease in the rate of  degradation , above pH  11,  is due to a decrease in 
the adsorption  Reactive Blue 4  molecules . In fact , the catalyst  surface may adsorb OH ⁻ ions 
and thus it becomes  negatively charged. Since Reactive Blue 4 is not  protonated a t high pH 
values, there is an electrostatic repulsion  between the catalyst nanoparticles and the dye 
molecules;  consequentl y, the degradation rate  decreases. The decrease in the photocatalytic

pH 61 
 degradation in the acidic medium is due to  a high adsorption of Reactive Blue 4 molecules 
that fully cover the catalyst surface, reducing absorption of light, which is very important for  
the photocatalytic  process.  
A similar trend was also found by Sakhtivel et al. (2003) [215] who investigated the effect 
of the pH on the Acid Brown 14 photocatalysis. They used ZnO as catalyst and solar light as 
energy source. They examin ed the effect of pH in the range 3 -11, using a  dye concentration 
of 311 g/L and a catalyst amount of 2.5 g/L. Their results are shown in Figure 3.13.  
 
Figure 3.13 - Influence of pH on the rate of degradation of Acid Brown 14 (C AB14 = 
311 g/L; C catalyst  = 2.5 g/L [215]).  
 
They observed that the rate of degradation of the Acid Brown 14 increase d with increase in 
pH, and found the  maximum rate of degradation at pH 10.  They explained that a t low pH 
range, electrostatic interactions between  the positive catalyst surface and dy e anions lead to 
strong adsorption of the dye on the metal oxide support. They also observed that the 
photocatalytic degradation efficiency of ZnO was higher at alkaline pH  range even though 
the adsorption of the dye molecules is low at alkaline pH. In the ir opinion,  alkaline pH range 
enhances  the formation of  more ·OH due to the presence of a large amount  of OH⁻ ions in 
the alkaline medium , which  significantly increases  the photocatalytic degrad ation of dye .  
Figure 3.11 shows that the Reactive Blue 4 decolorization increases rapidly as the solution 
pH increases up to 6 and more gradually above the solution pH of  6. The maximum value is 
achieved at pH 10. Therefore, t he photocatalytic degradation of Reactive  Blue 4 is strongly 
favored in  alkaline pH , as it was already reported by Zhou et al. (2008) [214] . The high

pH 62 
 colour removal  at pH 10 can be explained on the base of the zero point charge of the Fe -
TiO 2 catalyst . The zero point charge of Fe -TiO 2 species is comprised between 7.4 and 8.1 
(Di Paola et al. (2001)) [21 6] and, above this value, the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles 
is negatively charged due to adsorbed OH- ions. The presence of large quantities of adsorbed 
OH- ions on the particle s surface favo urs the formation of ·OH radicals, (OH- ions react with 
free electron -hole pairs and produce hydroxyl radicals) which are responsible for dye 
decolorization .  
On the other hand, a decrease in the colour removal at pH 12 is observed as is shown  in 
Figure 3.11. This is due to a decrease in the adsorption of the Reactive Blue 4  molecules on 
the catalyst  surface. At pH 12, the catalyst surface can absorb  a lot of OH- ions and thus it 
becomes negatively charged. Because the  Reactive Blue 4 is not protonated at pH 12, there 
is a strong electrostatic repulsion between the surface charges on the adsorbent and the 
adsorbate, that hinders the adsorption of the dye molecules ; so the colour removal 
percentage  decreases a t pH 1 2.  
Moreover, according to Rys & Zollinger (1992) [217] and Neppolian et al. (1998)  [171], in 
the chemical structure of the Reactive B lue 4 dye, substituents of an electron -donating group  
such as –NH 2 (in the α-positions of the carbonyl group ) are able to form  intramolecular 
hydrogen bonds  at high pH values : this makes  the dye structure chemically stable at high pH  
ranges . The chromophores of the dye remain intact after  light irradiation and hence, the 
degradation of the dye  is reduced  (Tusi and Chu, 2001)  [218].  
At pH 8, the solution pH is near the zero point charge of the catalyst. The catalyst surface is 
not electrically charged and the molecules of dye cannot be adsorbed on it. Dye molecules 
are probably oxidised only by hydroxyl radicals, and the direct oxidation by positive holes 
(hVB+) and direct reduction by conduction band electrons  (eCB-), proposed by Gotzman (2009) 
[219] as mechanisms for dyes degradation, don’t occur.  
At pH 6, the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles is positively charged because  the solution 
pH is below the zero point charge of the catalyst. As the catalyst surface is almost fully 
covered by Reactive Blue 4 molecules, the absorption of visible radiation on the catalyst 
surface decreases, and the colour removal efficiency also dec reases.  
 
In Figure 3.14 the spectra of the treated solution at pH 4 as a function of the running time 
are reported.  63 
  
Figure 3.14 – Absorption spectra of Reactive Blue 4 expressed as a function of the time  
(CRB4 = 100 ppm; Fe -TiO 2(10 mg Fe) = 1 g/L; pH = 4; light source = BL).   
 
Figure 3.14 shows that, when the solution was left in the dark (to improve the adsorption of 
the molecules of dye on the surface of the nanoparticles), the absorbance decreases (curve 
“0 min”) because a st rong adsorption occurs. Then, after LEDs irradiation, a part of the 
molecules of dye desorbs from the surface of the catalyst and returns in solution (curve “60 
min”). The photocatalytic reaction didn’t occur, in fact the curves “ 60 min”, “120 min” and 
“180 min” are overlying. This suggests that in acidic solution (pH 4) the photocatalyst is 
probably deactivated by the too low pH.  
This result is in agreement with the one obtained by Rupa et al. 2007 [158] that studied the 
effect of the pH on the photocata lysis of Reactive Yellow 17 using Ag -deposited TiO 2 
nanoparticles. They observed that at low pH there was a decrease in the photo degradation of 
Reactive Yellow 17 and concluded that it could  be due  to the dissolution of TiO 2 at highly 
acidic conditions.  
Similar  results were also reported in the photocatalysed degradation of  azo dyes [ 220–222].  
At pH 10 the highest colour removal was obtained, therefore this pH value was selected to 
carry out the following experiments.

 3.6.4 Comparison of photocatalytic efficiency of  Fe-TiO 2 (10 mg Fe) and TiO 2   
The photocatalytic activity of Fe-TiO2 (10 mg Fe)  powder was investigated and compared  
with that of  TiO 2. Laboratory experiments were carried out using 50 mL of a 100 ppm 
Reactive Blue 4 solution a t pH 10. Blue LEDs were used as light sources. The reaction time 
was 10 hours, included the first hour of adsorption in the dark. At the end of the 10 hours the 
reaction was expired. The trend of the absorbance peak at 595 nm, expressed as a function 
of the irradiation time, is shown in Figure 3.15.  
 
 
Figure 3.15 – Effect of BL and BL/catalyst on the Reactive Blue 4 decolorization, as a 
function of the irradiation time (C RB4 = 100 ppm; C catalyst  = 1 g/L; light source = BL).  
 
Figure 3.15  show s that , after 9 hours, the decrease in absorbance, in the presence of  TiO 2 or 
Fe-TiO 2, and in the absence of catalysts, was the same.  
Moreover, the trends  of the curves describing the TiO 2/LEDs and Fe -TiO 2 (10 mg Fe)/LEDs 
systems were identical, whereas the trend of the curve describing the system in the absence 
of catalyst was linear.   
In Table 3. 6 the colour removal percentages evaluated at 9 hours of irradiation for each 
system are reported.

The results shown in Table 3. 6 suggest that Reactive Blue 4 dye is highly unstable under 
exposure to blue LED s irradiation  and the presence of photocatalyst s is not necessary for the 
degradation of this dye. 
To confirm th ese results,  the behaviour  of a 300 ppm R eactive Blue 4 solution , at pH 10,  
was explored under  exposure to blue LEDs both in the absence of  catalyst  and in the 
presence of 3 g/L of Fe -TiO 2 (10 mg Fe) . The reaction time was 6 hours, including the first 
hour of adsorption in the dark . The results are shown in Figure 3.16.  
 
Figure 3.16 – Effect of BL and BL/catalyst on the Reactive Blue 4 decolorization, as a function of 
the irradiation time (C RB4 = 300 ppm; Fe -TiO 2(10 mg Fe) = 3 g/L; pH = 10; light source = BL).  
 
Figure 3.16 shows that the trends of the curves describing the absorbance decrease, are 
similar, and that the solution could be  almost totally decoloured in 5 hours  of irradiation.

Table 3. 7 shows that the colour removal percentages are almost the same for both systems. 
This could mean that the Reactive Blue 4 dye was not stable under irradiation with blue 
light LEDs. However, as Jo et al. (2014) [242] reported, some dyes are degraded by 
expo sure to light in the absence of any catalyst . Moreover, there could also be a strong 
relationship  between the light LEDs and the dye, that are both blue. The dye could absorb  
all the light emitted by the LEDs , therefore the light photons cannot excite  the catalyst  
nanoparticles, and cannot start  the separation of the electron -hole pairs and all the other 
reactions.   
Since this study concerns the treatment of reactive dyes by photocatalysis , another dye  was 
chosen to carry out the experiments, alt hough , for this dye, further investigation s would be 
necessary.   
 
 
3.7 Reactive Red 120 
3.7.1 Photodecolorizaton of Reactive Red 120: preliminary experiments  
The other  reactive dye  used to carry out the experiments, was the Reactive Red 120. 50 mL 
of a 100 ppm Reactive Red 120 solution at pH 10 w ere used in each test.  
Dye solution was t reated by irradiation with blue LEDs , in the following conditions:  
 
 in the absence of catalyst;  
 in the presence 1 g/L of Fe -TiO 2 (10 mg Fe) ;  
 and in the presence of TiO 2 nanoparticles (1 g/L).  67 
 The reaction was stopped after 2 hours of exposure to blue LEDs irradiation for the 
photocatalytic systems, and it was stopped at 5 hours for the system without catalysts.  
The results are shown in Figure 3.17.

(CRR120 = 100 ppm; pH = 10; Fe -TiO 2(10 mg Fe) = 1 g/L; TiO 2 = 1 g/L; light source = BL).  
 
Results show that:  
 
 in the absence of catalyst the LEDs light is not able to decolorize the dye, the 
absorbance remains the same even after 5 hours of irradiation;  
 the dye cannot be decolorized even in the presence of catalysts and, as result, after 2 
hours of irradiation, the absorbance remains unchanged.  
 
In the same conditions,  the Reactive Blue 4 dye decolorization was 20% in the presence of 
catalyst, and 10% without catalyst, as shown in Figure 3.18.   
The decolorization of Reactive Red 120 was studied also by Kavitha and Palanisamy (2011) 
[162]. They treated 100 ppm of Reacti ve Red 120 solution at pH 4.1 using 2.5 g/L of TiO 2 
and a 50 W halogen lamp as source of visible light. They found no degradation in the 
presence of visible light only, but in the presence of both catalyst and visible light, a high 
dye degradation was obse rved. Their results are different from those reported in Figure 3.17.

 One possible expla nation could be the  different type of light source (LEDs strip vs. halogen 
lamp), the different power of the light sources (24 W vs. 50 W), the pH of the treated 
soluti on (10 vs. 4) and the catalyst concentration (1 g/L vs. 2.5 g/L).   
However, because the results in Figure 3.17 show  that the Reactive Red 120 dye can not be 
treated merely by direct irradiation and cannot be decolorized even in the presence of 
photocat alysts, a different dye was cho sen to carry out this study.

3.8 Reactive Violet 5  
3.8.1 Photodecolorization of Reactive Violet 5: preliminary tests  
To evaluate  the photode gradability of Reactive Violet 5, preliminary experiments were 
conducted. 50 mL of a 100 ppm Reactive Violet 5 solution, at pH 10, were treated trough 
photolysis and photocatalysis.  
For the photocatalytic decolorization tests, 3 g/L of Fe -TiO 2 (10 mg Fe) were used. The 
experiments were stopped after 2 hours of irradiation.  0 10 20 30 Colour removal (%)  irradiation time:  2 hours  69 
 The results are shown in Figure 3.19.  
 
Figure 3.19 – Effect of BL and BL/catalyst on Reactive Violet 5 decolorization (C RV5 = 100 
ppm; pH = 10; C catalyst  =   3 g/L).  
 
The experimental data presented in Fig ure 3.19  indicate  that blue LEDs  alone had not 
appreciable  effects on the removal of R eactive Violet 5 . In contrast, significant  dye 
decoloriza tion was observed when blue LEDs and catalyst  were  used simultaneously .  
Moreover it can be seen that:  
 
 in the absence of catalyst, the absorbance peak (at 559  nm) decreases very slowly  as 
a function of irradiation time, and only about 5% of dye decolorization was obtained 
after 2 hours of exposure to LEDs light;  
 in the presence of catalyst and LEDs light, the  absorbance peak decreases line arly as 
a function of irradiation time. About 24 % of de colorization was achieved after 2 
hours of irradiation.  
 
For the Reactive Violet 5 solution  the difference between the color removal yields in the 
presence and in the absence of the catalyst, is about 20 %.

 In the same conditions, for the Reactive B lue 4 dye, t he difference between the color 
removal yields in the presence and in the absence of the catalyst, was only 8%.  
These findings suggest that Reactive Violet 5 cannot be treated merely by direct irradiation, 
as it occurred for Reactive Blue 4, and that it requires a suitable catalyst. The UV/vis 
spectra, reported in Figure 3.20, clearly show the decrease in concentration of the Reactive 
Violet 5 solution.  
 
 
Figure 3.20 – Absorption spectra of Reactive Violet 5 (C RV5 = 100 ppm; pH = 10;  
Fe-TiO 2(10 mg Fe) = 3 g/L; light source = BL).  
 
The spectra in Figure 3.20  show that there was no formation of by -products during the 
photocatalytic treatment. The decolorization of the Reactive Violet 5  may be due to the 
initial electrophilic cleavage of its chromophoric azo ( -N=N -) bond.  The a zo bonds are more 
reactive in azo dyes and can be oxidized by the positive holes or the hydroxyl radicals; they 
can also  be reduced by the electrons in the conduction band of the catalyst (Ganesh el at., 
1994)  [223] .

In each test the temperature was maintained at ambient conditions and the pH was left 
unmodified. The UV/v is spectra were  monitored for ten hours  (including the hour of 
adsorption in the dark) , to observe the trend s of absorbance s as a function of time .  
The trend of the ch aracteristic Reactive Violet 5 peak (at 559 nm), expressed as a function 
of irradiation time, is shown in Figure 3.21 .

(CRV5 =  100 ppm; Ccatalyst = 1 g/L; light source = BL).  
 
Figure 3.21 shows that:  
 
 under blue LED s irradiation and in the absence of catalysts, the Reactive Violet 5 
solution  cannot  be decolorized, even after 9 hours;  
 in the presence of TiO 2 and under blue LEDs irradiation, the Reactive Violet 5 
solution can be dec olorized, but the reaction is s low;  
 in the presence of Fe -TiO 2 and blue LEDs irradiation, the decolorization occurs at a 
faster rate.

The results reported in Table 3. 8 confirm  that the de colorization  of Reactive Violet 5 is due 
to the photocatalytic reactions that can successfully  decolorize and degrade this dye.  
However, after 9 hours of irradiation the color removal was (7% and 14% with TiO 2 and Fe -
TiO 2 (10 mg Fe), respectively), even changing catalyst. Therefore another “catalyst 
concentration/dye concentration” ratio was chosen to carry out this study.  
 
 
3.8.3 Catalyst to dye concentration ratio of 100  
Experiments were carried out using a Reactive Violet 5 dye concentration of 30 ppm and a 
catalyst concentration of 3 g/L. 50 mL of dye solution were used  in each test.  
 
 
3.8.3.1 Photocatalyst selection  
To find out the catalyst for highest photocatalytic  decolorization , different types of  catalyst 
including TiO 2, N-doped TiO 2, Fe-TiO 2(10 mg Fe), Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe), Fe -TiO 2 (100 mg 
Fe), an Degussa P -25 were employed.   
The concentration of R eactive Violet 5  (30 ppm ) and the catalyst concentration (3 g/L) were   
maintained constant  in all experiments. The pH was unmodified. The reaction time was 
fixed at 10 hours, including the adsorption time in the dark.   
In Figure 3.22 the results of the experiments are shown.  73 
  
Figure 3.22 - Reactive Violet 5) photolysis and photocatalytic degradation in the presence 
of different catalysts (C RV5 = 30 ppm; C catalyst  = 3 g/L; light source = BL).  
 
Figure 3.22 shows that in the presence of 3 g/L of catalyst the 30 ppm Reactive Violet 5 dye 
solution can be decolorized and that the absorbance decreases as a function of irradiation 
time  almost linearly .  
In Table 3. 9 the colour removal yields evaluated after 9 hours of blue LEDs  irradiation , in 
the absence and in the presence of catalysts, are reported.

 Table 3. 9 shows that :  
 
 the photolysis alone is not able to decolorize the dye : the colour removal is  only 2% 
after 9 hours;   
 the photocatalytic decolorization efficiency is similar for the N -doped TiO 2 and P -25 
Deguss a/ blue LEDs systems (22% and 25 %, respectively) ;  
 the Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe)/ blue LEDs system is the most  efficient in decolorizing 
Reactive Violet 5  (dye removal 48 %); 
 the Fe -TiO 2 (100 mg Fe)/ blue LEDs also has high efficiency in Reactive Violet 5 
decolorization (43%) ;  
 for each system  the colour removal i s never higher than 50 %.  
 
These results can be motivated as follows. Alt hough the band gap energy of the Fe -TiO 2 
(100 mg Fe) i s smaller than that of the Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe) (2.63 and 2.90 eV, respectively), 
the first one seems to have a lower photocatalytic activity. This could be due to the high 
content of Fe(III) ions  which can act as recombination centers for the photo -generated hole -
electron pairs  [224, 225].  
Fe-TiO 2 (10 mg Fe) and TiO 2 have similar band gap energies (3.12 and 3.17 eV, 
respectively), this could explain the similar colour removal percentages obtained, though 
TiO 2 exhibits  a slightly higher photocatalyti c activity.  
Commercial Degussa P -25 and N -doped TiO 2, although they have different band gap 
energies (3.17 and 2.5 eV, respectively), gave almost identical results. Probably, the 
nitrogen content of the N -doped TiO 2 was too  high (N/Ti molar ratio was 18.6 ), thus the 
nitrogen ions enhance d the recombination of photogenerated  electrons and holes and did not  
allow reactions to proceed with any  noticeable effect under visible light  [226]. Moreover, 
the colour removal yields obtained with N-doped TiO 2 were lower than that of undoped 
TiO 2;  also in this case, the reason could depend on t he doping sites which could also work 
as recombination centers  for the  photogenerated  electron –hole pairs  as it was reported by 
Irie et al.  (2003) [227].  
Generally , the addit ion of nitrogen  results in an improvement in visible light photocatalytic  
activity  as it was reported in literatu re [104, 154], but contrasting findings were also 
reported [116, 122]. For example, in a recent study, N-doped TiO 2 films were obtained by 
the addition of ammonia during chemical  vapour  deposition growth of TiO 2, and, d espite the 
presence of N impurities at substitutional sites , none visible light -induced photocatalytic 75 
 activity  was observed. According to the authors, the presence of  N impurities  at 
substitutional sites  couldn’t  be cited as a means of inducing visible  light activity in TiO 2 
films  [122] . Selvaraj et al. (2013) [228]  studied  the photocatalytic degradation of some  
reactive triazine dyes  including Reactive R ed 120  and Reactive B lue 160 on N -doped TiO 2 
anatase and Degussa P -25 in the presence of natural  sunlight. They reported that Degussa P-
25 showed higher  photocatalytic activity compared to the N -doped TiO 2 for the degradation 
of Reactive Red 120 and Reactive Blue 160, but the high  photocatalytic activity found for 
the Degussa P -25 was not explained.  
Figure 3.23 and Table 3. 9 show that for the Reactive Violet 5 decolorization, Fe -TiO 2 (50 
mg Fe) is the most suitable catalyst. It could be due to its ions content, that allows  
maintain ing the hole -electron pairs  effectively separated , enhancing the colour removal 
yields. These results are different from those obtained for the Reactive Blue 4 
decolorization, suggesting that the nature of the dye, the solutions concentration, the 
concentration of doping agents and the catalyst loading could widely influence the 
photocatalytic processes.  
The UV/v is spectra obtained for the Reactive Violet 5  photode coloriza tion in the presence 
of Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe) are shown in Figure 3.23.

 As it can be observed from the spectra obtained b efore the irradiation, Reactive Violet 5 
exhibits two main bands, one in the UV region ( ʎmax 221 nm), and the  other in the visible 
region  (ʎmax 559 nm). The 559 nm band is  due to the azo bonds  (–N=N –), which are 
responsible for the violet  color , whereas the 221 nm band  observed in the UV region can be 
attributed to the aromatic rings present in  the azo dye structure.  It can be observed that, 
during the treatment, the intensities  of both bands decreased suggesting that decolorization  
was accompanied by at least partial degradation  of the aromatic ring structures.  
 
 
3.8.3.2 Effect of pH  
pH is one of the signifi cant parameters for the photocatalytic  dye degradation . In order to 
find out the optimal pH for the de coloriza tion of R eactive Violet 5 dye, the pH of the 
reaction mixture was varied from 4 to 12 by keeping the dye concentration ( 30 ppm) and the 
catalyst  amount ( 3 g/L) constant in all experiments . To keep the pH constant during each 
experiment, buffer solutions were used. After the adsorption in the dark, which required 1 
hour, the solution was exposed to blue LEDs irradiation for 9 hours.  
Results are reported in Figure 3.2 4.  
 
 
Figure 3.2 4 – Effect of pH on the Reactive Violet 5 photocatalysis  (C RV5 = 30 ppm;

 It can be observed that at pH 4, 6 and 8 the decrease in the absorbance peak is not 
appreciable , whereas at pH 12 and 10, a significant decrease in the absorbance peak is 
achieved. I t can also be observed  that at pH 10 the solution is totally decolourized after only 
2 hours of irradiation.  
The absorb ance decreases almost linearly as a function of time, both at pH 10 and at pH 12. 
For the solution at pH 12, the absorbance decrease is about 80% after 9 hours of irradiation, 
whereas the solution at pH 10 can be totally decolorized after only 2 hours of e xposure to 
blue LEDs.  
In Figure 3.25 the trend of the colour removal as a function of pH is shown.  
 
Figure 3.2 5 -  Effect of pH on the Reactive Violet 5 decolorization evaluated after 9 hours of 
irradiation (C RV5 = 30 ppm; Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) = 3 g/L; lig ht source = BL).  
 
Figure 3.25 shows that the Reactive Violet 5 decolorization trend, as a function of pH, is 
similar to those obtained for the Reactive Blue 4 dye.  
As reported in Figure 3.25, the colour removal percentage  slightly increases as the solution 
pH increases from 4 to 8 and reaches a maximum at pH 10. When pH increases from 10 to 
12, the colour removal decreases.  
The high colour removal at pH 10 can be due to the generation of hydroxyl radi cals, which 
are largely responsi ble for oxid ation processes,  in alkaline solutions. (These radicals play an 
essential role in the breaking  of the N=N conjugated  system in azo dyes ). According m any 
authors high pH can e nhance the dyes decolorization ; Murugarandham et al. (2004) [229] 
found  that incre asing pH from 1 to 9 increased decolourization rates for Reactive Orange 4

 (an anionic dye) from 25.27% to 90.49% after only 40 minutes. They also observed (2006) 
[84] that Reactive Black 5 decolorization rates increased with pH. Also in this case, the  
results were attributed to a more efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals due to the increase 
of the hydroxide ions concentration.   
Figure 3.25  shows a decrease in the colour removal at pH 12. This could be due to a 
decrease in the adsorption of the Reactiv e Violet 5  molecules on the catalyst surface. 
Probably , at pH 12 the OH- ions adsorption on the catalyst is too high , and its surface 
becomes negatively charged. The negative charges on the catalyst are expected repel the 
Reactive Violet 5 dye molecules, so a decrease in photodegradation efficiency can be 
observed.  
At pH 8 the Reactive Violet 5 removal was only 9%. This  result suggests that, decreasing 
the pH of only two units with respect to its optimal value (pH 10) can cause a noticeable 
decrease of the OH- ions in solution. This results in a strong decrease of the ·OH radicals 
and in a decrease of the solution decolo rization.  
At pH 6, the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles is positively charged because the solution 
pH is lower than  the zero point charge of the catalyst. The positively charged catalyst 
surface favours  the attraction of Reactive Violet 5  molecules wh ich cover s all the active 
sites of the catalyst. As a result, the absorption of the photons  on the catalyst surface 
decreases and so does the colour removal efficiency . 
In Figure 3.26 the UV/vis spectra of the solution at pH 4 are shown.

 Figure 3.26 shows that, at pH 4, there is a little adsorption in dark  (curve “0 h”) . When the 
LEDs are on, the absorbance values seem to  increase, this may be due to dye desorption 
phenomena from the catalyst surface p robabl y induced by heating the solution. It is clear 
that t here are no degradation phenomena,  because  the spectra remain qualitatively the same. 
This suggests that the catalyst could be  deactivated  in acidic conditions.  The loss of 
photocatalytic activity could be also due to the fact that, in acidic conditions, the particles 
that tend to agglomerate, thi s may reduce the surface a rea of the catalyst for the maximum 
dye adsorption as well as the photon absorption  [230].  
As the Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe) showed its highest photocatalytic activity at pH 10, this value of 
pH was selected to carry out this study.  
 
 
3.8.3.3 Effect of catalyst concentration  
The catalyst concentration is another important parameter, which has  strong influence on the 
degradation kinetics of dye solution. To avoid the use of a catalyst  excess, it is necessary to 
identify the optimum loading for  an efficient removal of dye. So it is  necessary to optimize 
the amount of catalyst with respect to  the highest photocatalytic activity.   
In order to determine the optimal catalyst  concentration, a series of experiments were 
carried out using di fferent concentrations of  the Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) catalyst varying from 0 
to 6 g/L, at optimized pH of 10 with 30  ppm dye  solution . The results of the experiments are 
shown in Figure 3.27.  
 
Figure 3.2 7 – Effect of the catalyst concentrations on the Reactive Violet 5 decolorization

 Figure 3.27 shows that the absorbance of the treated solution decreases as a function of time, 
both in the absence and in the presence of Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe). I n the absence of catalyst, 
the solution can be decolorized, but the photolysis requires a longer time, and cannot be 
completed even after 9 hours (the decrease in absorbance is about 80%) .  
In the presence of 0.5 g/L of catalyst, the reactions proceed rapidly, and the complete 
decolorization can be achieved in 4 hours , whereas, in the presence of 1.5 g/L of catalyst , 
the complete decolorization requires 2.5 hours . For catalyst concentration of 3  g/L, 4.5 g/L 
and 6 g/L , the decolorization of the solution was completed in 2 hours; this because the 
absorbance of the solution was measured at t = 2 h. However , the trend of the curves at 3, 
4.5 and 6 g/L of catalysts, suggests that the decolorization w as completed in less than 2  
hours. Therefore  the values of the rate constants of reaction, k, (shown in Figure  3.28) are 
not reliable because they overlook that the decolorization was completed in less than 2 
hours.  
 
Figure 3.28  – Rate constants evaluated for each catalyst concentration (C RV5 = 30 ppm; pH 
= 10; Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) = (0 – 6 g/L); light source = BL).  
 
For the se reason s, the initial rate of each reaction, as a function of the catalyst  
concentration, was evaluated. The  Initial Rate M ethod was used  for this purpose . As unit of 
time, the first hour of irradiation w as chosen. The trend of the init ial rate of reaction (m), is 
shown in Figure 3.29.

concentration (C RV5 = 30 ppm; Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) = (0 – 6) g/L;  pH = 10; light source =  
BL). 
 
Figure 3.29 shows that the photocatalytic de coloriza tion rate increase s with increasing the 
amounts of Fe-TiO 2 (50 mg Fe). When the amount of Fe-TiO 2 (50 mg Fe)  is increased from 
0 up to 3 g/L , the initial reaction rate, greatly increases. Over 3 g/L, the increase of the 
initial  reaction rate isn’t significative, so 3 g/L was selected as the optimal catalyst 
concentration.  
The results showed in Figure 3.27 and 3.29 suggest that as the catalyst concentration 
increases, the surface area for the photocatalytic reaction  also increas es so the incident light  
absorbed by Fe -TiO 2 (50 mg Fe) progressively increases because a larger amount of photons 
are adsorbed [159] . Moreover, more active sites may be covered with dye ions, but, when all 
the dye molecules are adsorbed on the catalyst surface, adding more catalyst  doesn’t 
enhance the decolorization . When the catalyst is overdosed, the opacity of the suspension 
increases and the light reflectance  also increases.  Additionally, agglomeration and 
sedimentation of nanocatalyst particles  could occur. It makes  a significant fraction of 
catalyst inaccessible to absorbing both the dye  molecules  and the radiation s. Generally,

effects . Similar observations were reported in earlier works f or degradation of dyes such as

3.8.3.4 Effect of H 2O2 
The photoassisted de colorization  of organic dyes can be significantly  improved in the 
presence of hydrogen  peroxide. In order to evaluate  this effect, hydrogen peroxide  was 
added in 50 mL of a Reactive Violet 5 solution (30 ppm)  buffered at pH 10, in  a 
concentration  range of 10-100 mM. The results of the experiments are sho wn in Figure 3.30.  
 
Figure 3.30 – Effect of H 2O2 concentration on the Reactive Violet 5 decolorization,  
expressed as a function of irradiation time (C RV5 = 30 ppm; Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) = 3 g/L;  
H2O2 = (0 – 100) mM; pH 10; light source = BL).  
 
Figure 3.30 shows that the hydrogen peroxide increases the reaction rate. Furthermore, the 
complete decolorization is achieved in about  2 hours of irradiation, both in the absence and 
in the presence of hydrogen per oxide. However,  the trend of the curves s uggests that the

 decolorization was completed in less than 2 hours ; therefore, the calculated values of  the 
rate constants of reaction , (in Figure 3. 31), k, are not reliable as they overlook the fact that 
the decolorization was  completed in less than 2 hours.

ppm; Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) = 3 g/L;  H 2O2 = (0 – 100) mM; pH 10; light source = BL).  
 
For these reasons, the Initial Rate Method was used to calculate the initial rate of each 
reaction, as a function of the hydrogen peroxide concentration. As unit of time, the first half 
hour of exposure to blue LEDs was chosen. In Table 3. 10 the initial rate values have been 
reported.

 In Figure 3.32 the trend of the initial  rate of reaction, as a function of the hydrogen peroxide 
concentration, is shown.  
 
 
Figure 3.3 2 – Trend of the initial rate of reaction as a function of the hydrogen peroxide 
concentration (C RV5 = 30 ppm; pH 10; Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) = 3 g/L; light source = BL).  
 
Figure 3.32 shows that as the hydrogen peroxide concentration increases, the initial rate of 
reaction also increases up to 60 mM H 2O2 concentration.  
When the hydrogen peroxide exceeds 60 m M, the initial rate of reaction decreases.  
Therefore 60 mM can be selected as the optimal hydrogen peroxide concentration.  
At low concentrations , hydrogen peroxide enhances the decoloriza tion rate of Reactive 
Violet 5, because:  
 
 hydrogen peroxide is a better electron acceptor than molecular oxygen, it can act as  a  
trap of the conduction band electrons (Eq. ( 3.7)) preventing the hole -electron pairs 
recombination [231] and thus increasing the chances of formation of hydroxyl 
radical s on the surface of the catalyst  [232, 233].  
 it can also produce hydroxyl radical s via photodecomposition (Eq. (3.9 )); 
 it can react with the superoxide radical producing other hydroxyl radicals (Eq. (3.8));

However, for  H2O2 concentration s greater than the critical one, it may react with hydroxyl 
radicals (Eqs. (3.10) and (3.11)), and also act as scavenger of the photoproduced holes.  
 
H2O2 + ·OH   →   HO 2·  +    H 2O                                                                                      (3.10)

Moreover, at high concentration, hydrogen peroxide could modify the catalyst surface [234]. 
A combination of these positive and negative effects  could be responsible for the observed 
maximum in  Figure 3.32. However, the existence of an optimum H 2O2 concentration was 
reported in several other studies on azo dyes [84; 156; 161; 165; 171].  
 
 
3.9 Discussion  
It may be interesting to compare the presen t results with those obtained in other studies on 
Reactive Violet 5 degradation.   
Chung et Chen (2008) [159] investigated the photocat alytic degradation of R eactive Violet 5 
using titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles . The experiments were carried out in a  quartz 
beaker with a magnetic stirrer, which was placed in  the center of the UV photo -reactor . The 
reactor was  equipped with four Xenon 254 nm lamps . Under optimized conditions, t he 
photodegra dation efficiency was 90% after 20 min utes of irradiatio n and r eached nearly 
100% after 80 minutes.  
Cabansag et al. (2013) [164] studied the photocatalysis of Reactive Violet 5 using ZnO 
particles. Irradiation was carried out inside a closed rectangular box  with two UV lamp s 
having emission peak at 365 nm. Under opti mized conditions, a colour removal of 74% was 
obtained after 30 minutes of irradiation, whereas, after 90 minutes, the solution was totally 
decolorized.  
In 2012, Kunal et al. [240] studied the d ecolorization and degradation of Reactive Violet 5 
using an acclimatized indigenous bacterial mixed cultures -SB4 isolated from  anthropogenic 86 
 dye contaminated soil . They obtained the complete dye removal within 18 hours, under the 
best working conditions.  
Ayed et al. (2017) [241] evaluated the decolourization and th e degradation efficiency of 
Reactive Violet 5 using a novel bacterial  consortium. It was found that u nder optimal 
conditions, the bacterial consortium was  able to decolourize the dye completely (  > 99%) 
within 8 h.  
Therefore, the treatment of R eactive Violet 5, in the presence of catalyst and under exposure 
to visible light,  can lead to removal  efficiencies that are comparable or higher than those  
reported for UV- photocataly sis or microbial degradation  of Reactive Violet 5 . Moreover , 
compared to the mi crobial degradation processes, the examined method seems to be simpler  
to implement and more flexible in operation.  
Finally,  a comparison with the results obtained by applying  the vis -photocatalytic  process to 
other dyes [ 142; 177; 179; 180 ] provides  further support to the view that the treatment  
efficiency , in terms of decolorization,  depends strongly on the nature of the dye.

 Conclusions and future developments  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusions   
The photocatalytic decolorization of three reactive dyes, Reactive Blue 4, Reactive Red 120 
and Reactive Violet 5,  under exposure to visible LEDs , was investigated in this study. The 
photocatalytic process was carried out in a cylindrical  photoreactor . The solution, containing 
the catalyst as an aqueous sus pension , was irradiated by  visible  blue LEDs .  
Reactive Blue 4 was found to be not stable under irradiation of blue LEDs. In fact it could 
be decolorized by exposure to light even in the absence of catalyst.  A Reactive Blue 4 100 
ppm solution, buffered at pH 10, was treated under exposure to visible light emitted by 
LEDs  for 9 hours, in the absence of catalyst and in the presence of 1 g/L of Fe -TiO 2(10 mg 
Fe) and TiO 2, respectively. It was found that the trend s of the curves describing the 
TiO 2/LEDs and Fe -TiO 2(10 mg Fe)/LEDs systems were identical, whereas the curve 
describing the system in the absence of catalyst followed another path, although all the three 
systems achieved the same colour removal percentage s. These results suggest that the 
Reactive Blue 4 dye decolorization seems to be mainly influenced by the light source and 
the contribution of the catalysts to the photocatalysis is almost negligible. This means that 
there could be  a strong relationship be tween the light of the LEDs and the dye, which are 
both blue. It could be hypothesized that the Reactive Blue 4 absorbs a large part of the light 
emitted by the LEDs, therefore there are not enough light photons available to excite the 
catalyst nanoparticl es.  
Preliminary experiments were carried out to evaluate the behaviour of the Reactive Red 120 
dye. The experimental conditions were the same adopted for the Reactive Blue 4 dye. It was 
found  that in the absence of catalyst the LEDs are not able to decolo rize the dye, in fact 
there was no colour removal even after 5 hours of irradiation. It was also found that the dye 
could not be decolorized ev en in the presence of catalysts. These results suggest that 
Reactive Red 120 is a very stable dye and probably it need to be treated by other processes.  
Preliminary experiments carried out on the Reactive Violet 5 dye indicated that it was 
resistant to di rect photolysis and it could be successfully treated by photocatalysis. The 88 
 subsequent experiments were carried out using a dye concentration of 30 ppm and a catalyst 
concentration of 3 g/L. Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) was found to be an  efficient  catalyst for  the 
decolorization  of Reactive Violet 5  in the presence of visible light . Fe-TiO 2(50 mg Fe)  
showed superior photocatalytic activity compared to other catalysts such as undoped TiO 2, 
P-25 Degussa, N -doped TiO 2, Fe-TiO 2(10 mg Fe) and Fe -TiO 2(100 mg Fe). The influ ence 
of the pH was, then, evaluated. It was found that Reactive Violet 5 photocatalysis in the 
presence of Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) was strongly favoured in alkaline conditions. pH 10 was 
selected as the optimal; at pH 10 the solution could be totally decolorized  after only 2 hours 
of irradiation. At optimized pH of 10 a series of experiments were carried out using different 
concentrations of the Fe -TiO 2(50 mg Fe) catalyst varying from 0 to 6 g/L. 3 g/L was 
selected as the optimal catalyst concentration. Finally, the influence of the hydrogen 
peroxide on the photocatalytic decolorization of Reactive Violet 5 was evaluated. A 
hydrogen peroxide concentration of 60 mM was selected as the optimal. Under the best 
conditions the complete decolorization was achieved in le ss than 2 hours of exposure to blue 
LEDs.  
After a comparison of the present results with those obtained  in other studies on Reactive 
Violet 5 decolorization , it was found that Reactive Violet 5 photocatalysis under visible 
LEDs allows to achieve better results than the microbial treatments and results comparable 
to those achieved under traditional UV photocatalysis.  
It was observed that blue LEDs offer a pra ctical alternative dye treatment at lower cost: they 
are small, they can be used in different types of photocatalytic reactor set -ups and they have 
a low operative temperature, whereas UV irradiation sources can waste up to 80% of the 
light that they produ ce.  
It can be concluded that visible LEDs could be used for development of an economic and 
energy efficient photocatalytic reactor.  
 
 
Future development s 
In this work the photocatalytic decolorization of Reactive Blue 4, Reactive Red 120 and 
Reactive Viol et 5 was studied, but only the Reactive Violet 5 photocatalysis was optimized.  
A detailed study of the Reactive Blue 4 and Reactive Red 120 behavio ur under blue LEDs 
irradiation, in the presence and in the absence of catalysts, could be a research topic.  89 
 It may be interesting studying the mineralization of Reactive Violet 5 and finding the 
optimal conditions for the highest T.O.C. removal. Future works may explore the removal of 
these dyes from real waste streams using the same procedures.  
In the present study, the experimentation was planned varying the level of a single 
parameter (catalyst concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration) each time. It may 
become important to understand, not only the effects of the individual factors, but also the 
possible  interactions and dependencies between the various factors.  It could be evaluated the 
effect of several factors simultaneously,  each with different levels ; in this case the 
experimentation could be planned using a Definitive Screening Design, and then a Ce ntral 
Composite Design could be used.  
Moreover i n order to assess the feasibility of the process on a  larger scale, further research is 
required focusing on  the mechanisms of dye degradation and mineralization  together with a 
detailed cost –benefit analysi s.
