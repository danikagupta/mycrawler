abstract
Oil palm fronds (OPF) with a moisture content of 1.1% were used to prepare oil palm frond adsor -
bent (OPFAD) using chemical activation method, which consisted of impregnation treatment of 
OPF (10–15 mm) with potassium hydroxide at a ratio of 1:1, followed by carbonization at 400°C 
by N2 under a steady flow rate of 1 mL  min–1 for 3 h. Batch adsorption studies were conducted to 
investigate the adsorptive properties of oil palm frond adsorbent towards the removal of methylene 
blue dye. In this research, OPFAD was classified as mesopores with reference from the International 
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry with 2.7273 m2 g–1 of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, 
0.003112 cm3 g–1 of total pore volume, and 4.56361 nm of average pore diameter. The maximum 
removal percentage of methylene blue through the employment of OPFAD was 82.8% obtained at an adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g/100 mL and an initial dye concentration of 40 ppm. The experimental 
data from the adsorption process were fitted well into the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and 
Langmuir isotherm with a Gibbs free energy of adsorption (ΔG °) of –24.36 kJ mol
–1. Based on the 
present research study, it can be proposed that OPFAD can act as an effective alternative adsorbent.

1. Introduction
Dyes-bearing sewage discharged by textile, paint, paper, 
plastic, and leather industries have become a significant 
concern. It was reported that more than 700,000 metric tons of commercial dyes were produced annually with over 5%–10% discharged into industrial wastewaters [1,2]. Methylene blue (MB) is a cationic dye having significant applications in dyeing industries. However, MB imparts adverse effects to humans such as increased heart rate, vom-iting, shock, cyanosis, jaundice, and necrosis [3]. Thus, it is essential to remove MB dye from the process effluent.
Several efforts in wastewater treatment processes 
include adsorption, biosorption, coagulation/flocculation, advanced oxidation, ozonation, membrane filtration, ultra-filtration, photochemical degradation, and liquid–liquid 359 A.L.H. Chuein et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 216 (2021) 358–371
extraction [2,4]. Among all adsorption had notably sur -
passed the others because of its high efficiency and eco-
nomic feasibility [2,4,5]. In recent years, activated carbon 
derived from various biowastes and wood biomass, such 
as mangosteen peel waste [6], banana trunk waste [7], and Acacia mangium wood [8] have been studied for the 
adsorption of dyes. Activated carbon is a common and efficient adsorbent used to remove dyes from wastewaters 
because of its large surface area, high adsorption capacity, 
and diverse functional groups [9]. However, commercial activated carbon (CAC) remains limited due to the high 
cost resulting from the use of non-renewable and expen-
sive starting materials, such as coal [4]. Therefore, there 
are great interests in finding inexpensive, renewable, and 
effective agricultural waste-based alternatives to replace the existing CAC. Low-cost agricultural waste materials 
that have been successfully used to manufacture activated 
carbon in the recent past include waste tea [1], apricot 
stones [4], coconut shell [10], and oil palm biomass [3,11].
In Malaysia, the palm oil industry is one of the critical 
agro-industries which generate a massive amount of oil 
palm wastes in the form of leaves, trunks, fronds, empty 
fruit bunches, fibers, and shells [12]. It was reported that 
in 2010, nearly 80 million tons of oil palm waste was gen-erated by the industry and is estimated to increase up to 100 million tons by the year 2020 [3]. Despite no economic 
value, these wastes have created a severe disposal problem. 
Therefore, made use of the oil palm wastes as an alterna-
tive low-cost adsorbent would be beneficial from both environmental and economic points of view.
In this study, oil palm fronds (OPF) were chosen as 
a low-cost precursor for the production of an efficient 
adsorbent for the adsorption of MB owing to its effec-
tive adsorption performance in pesticides and herbicides [13,14]. In a previous study, oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) have been used for methyl orange (MO) dye 
adsorption [15]. To the best of our knowledge, no com-
prehensive study has been reported on the adsorption of 
MB by oil palm frond adsorbent (OPFAD). Therefore, the objectives of this study are to prepare a low-cost adsorbent from oil palm fronds (OPFAD) through chemical activation 
and to characterize through Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), 
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), scanning electron micros -
copy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and CHN analyses. The ability of OPFAD as a poten-
tial adsorbent to remove MB dye was studied via a batch 
adsorption system. The effect of adsorbent dosage, pH in 
the dye, as well as initial concentration and contact time 
of MB adsorption were studied. Adsorption isotherms and kinetics were investigated to evaluate experimental data.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
OPF were collected from oil palm plantation at Tikam 
Batu, Sungai Petani, Kedah in September 2018. All the 
chemicals used were analytical reagent grade (QRëC), 
including hydrochloric acid 37%, sulfuric acid 97%, and methylene blue powder. CAC was procured from QRec (ASIA) Sdn Bhd. Distilled water provided in the lab was 
used in all experiments. The OPF leaves were removed, and 
the strands were chopped into small pieces. Upon sun dry-
ing for 2 d, the chips were then ground to a 1–3 mm particle 
size using a Wiley mill, and the fiber was further dried in an oven at 50°C for 24 h. Milled dried OPF was kept in an 
airtight container for further use. Proximate analysis was 
carried out to determine the composition (% w/w) of milled, 
dried OPF. It was found to contain 0.97% ± 0.21% moisture 
content, 3.00% ± 0.20% ash content, 8.5% ± 1.47% extractives content, 37.65% ± 1.46% cellulose content, 31.64% ± 0.71% 
hemicellulose content and 18.37% ± 1.47% Klason lignin.
2.2. Preparation of OPFAD
The acquired OPF was used as a precursor. The thorns 
and leaflets of OPF were removed using a knife and a 
scissor. Then, the OPF was cut into small dice-like shape using a blade and knife. The chipped OPF was repeatedly washed to remove any solid impurities and sundried. Then, it was stored in an oven at 105°C overnight. The prepara-tion of the adsorbent from OPF was prepared following the method as reported by Njoku et al. [16] with slight modi-fications, where Njoku et al. [16] soaked coconut fronds in orthophosphoric acid (H
3PO4) instead of 10% KOH used 
in the present study. The chipped dried OPF then under -
went chemical impregnation. About 20 g of chipped dried OPF was mixed with 200 mL freshly prepared 10% KOH in 1:1 ratio by weight. The mixture was stirred using a mag-netic stirrer for 24 h to ensure full absorption of reagent into raw materials. The temperature of the stirring pro-cess was kept at 70°C to evaporate the excess water. Then, the mixture was filtered and washed with excess distilled water until the filtrate pH reached a range of 6.0–7.0. The impregnated OPF was dried in the oven at 105°C overnight.
The impregnated OPF then underwent carbonization 
(first process) using a tubular electric furnace. The OPF was placed in a steel crucible and inserted into a stainless tubular electric furnace, where it underwent carboniza-tion at 400°C under a steady gas flow (purified nitrogen) of 1 mL  min
–1 for 3 h, in contrast to the activation process 
carried out by Njoku et al. [16] using a stainless steel ver -
tical electric tubular furnace at 500°C under purified nitro-gen with a flow rate of 150 mL  min
–1 for 2 h. The second 
process of activation was continued using N2 gas under the 
same conditions and held for 2 h. OPFAD was cooled to room temperature before removing out from the furnace. OPFAD was then washed repeatedly with warm distilled water to eliminate any remaining KOH. OPFAD was, again, washed until the filtrate pH reached the range of 6.0–7.0. The washed OPFAD was dried in the oven at 105°C over -
night. Finally, dried OPFAD was crushed into fine pow-der form using mortar and pestle. The powdered OPFAD was kept in an airtight container for further analyses.
2.3. FTIR analysis
The functional groups of CAC and OPFAD were iden-
tified by FTIR analysis (Perkin Elmer System 2000 spec-
trometer, USA). Both samples were prepared using the KBr method by mixing the samples with potassium bromide A.L.H. Chuein et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 216 (2021) 358–371 360
with 1:100 weight ratio of sample to KBr. The spectra were 
recorded for 20 scans per sample in the transmittance mode at 4,000–400 cm
–1 with a resolution of 4.0 cm–1.
2.4. TGA analysis
TGA analysis of CAC and OPFAD were analyzed using 
thermogravimetric analyzer Perkin-Elmer STA 6000. The samples were heated from 30°C to 900°C at 10°C min
–1 
and held for 5 min at the highest temperature, which was 900°C before cooling it down to 30°C to proceed to the second heating.
2.5. N
2-BET analysis
Prior to nitrogen adsorption, the samples were degassed 
at 280°C for 8 h in a vacuum atmosphere. BET surface 
area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter for adsorption of CAC, OPF, and OPFAD were analysed using 
BET equation and Quantachrome Nova Win2© 1994–2002.
2.6. SEM/EDX analyses
The morphology of OPF and OPFAD were analyzed 
by SEM analysis. SEM micrographs were obtained at a 
magnification of 3,000× and an electron beam voltage of 10 kV . A small amount of OPF powder and OPFAD pow-der were dispersed to a carbon stud and the samples were placed in the QUANTA FEI 650 for SEM analysis. Meanwhile, the elemental analysis was analyzed using EDX spectroscopy (QUANTA FEI 650).
2.7. CHN analysis
The elemental composition of carbon, hydrogen, and 
nitrogen of CAC, OPF, and OPFAD were analyzed using a 
CHN analyzer. The sample was weighed in a tin capsule, 
and the sample amount for organic material is about 2–3 mg.
2.8. Effect of adsorbent dosage
Six different dosages of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 g 
of OPFAD were used to identify the optimum dosage for 
removal of 100 ppm MB dye. Each of the six different flasks was filled with 25 mL of 100 ppm MB dye and different dosages accordingly. Each flask was covered using alu-minum foil to protect from light penetration through the flask. The mixtures were shaken at 100 rpm for 24 h using a shaker. After 24 h, the samples were filtered, respectively, 
to separate OPFAD from MB dye solution. The concentra-tions of filtered MB solutions were analyzed using a direct reading spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Model UV-2600).
The removal percentage (%) of 100 ppm MB solution was 
calculated using Eq. (1):

Wee=−()0 (2)
where C0 is the initial concentration of MB solution, Ce is 
the concentration of MB at equilibrium, V is the volume 
of solution in L and W is the weight of the adsorbent or optimum dosage of adsorbent in g.
2.9. Spectrophotometric determination of MB dye
The residual concentrations of methylene blue dye were 
measured by using UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 
UV-2600, Japan) at a wavelength of 668 nm. The standard 
linear calibration plot was obtained in the concentra-
tion range of 1.0–50.0 ppm, where the correlation coeffi-cient (R
2) of the standard calibration plot for MB dye was 
found to be 0.9965. The limit of detection (LOD) calculated according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines was found to be 0.63 ppm.
2.10. Point of zero charge analysis
Point of zero charge (pH
pzc) analysis was determined 
by preparing 100 mL of distilled water with an adjusted 
pH of range 2–12 using 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH. The initial pH of each adjusted solutions was recorded. Approximately 0.1 g of OPFAD was added into each adjusted pH solution and shaken at 100 rpm for 48 h. After 48 h, the mixture was filtered to separate activated carbon from adjusted pH solution. The final pH for each adjusted pH solution was recorded, and a graph of pH
final 
against pHinitial was plotted. The intersection of line pHfinal = 
pHinitial was determined as the pHpzc.
2.11. Effect of pH
The aqueous solution of MB with a pH range from 4 
to 12 was prepared by adding a few drops of 0.1 M HCl 
or 0.1 M NaOH. The optimum dosage of 0.1 g of OPFAD 
was mixed with 100 mL of adjusted pH MB solutions and 
shaken at 100 rpm for 24 h. After 24 h, the mixture was 
filtered to separate activated carbons from MB solution. 
The concentration of the filtrate MB solution was ana-
lyzed using a direct reading spectrophotometer (UV-2600). 
The removal percentage of 100 ppm MB solution was 
calculated using Eq. (1).
2.12. Effect of contact time and kinetics studies
The adsorption equilibrium time can be studied by 
performing the effect of time taken by adsorbent to remove 
MB dye solution. The adsorption rate of adsorbent on removing MB dye solution is one of the criteria for defining the adsorbent efficiency. Approximately 0.1 g of OPFAD was mixed with 100 mL of 100 ppm MB dye solution. In order to study the effect of contact time, the mixtures were shaken at 100 rpm at a different time interval of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h; while to investigate on the kinetics of adsorption, the mix-tures were shaken at 100 rpm at several times range from 1 to 60 min. The concentration of MB solutions was analyzed 361 A.L.H. Chuein et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 216 (2021) 358–371
using a direct reading spectrophotometer (UV-2600) at 
668 nm.
2.13. Effect of initial MB dye concentration
The initial MB dye solutions concentrations of 5, 20, 
40, 60, 80, and 100 ppm were prepared, respectively. This 
is to study the rate of MB dye adsorption onto the opti-mum dosage of OPFAD. The optimum dosage of 0.1 g 
of OPFAD was added to 100 mL adjusted concentration 
MB solution and shaken at 100 rpm for 24 h. The MB dye 
solutions concentrations were monitored using direct 
reading spectrophotometry (UV-2600).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. FTIR analysis
FTIR spectra are used to identify the presence of the 
functional groups in the adsorbent, which in this study were 
CAC and OPFAD. Identification of the functional groups in CAC and OPFAD enhances the adsorption process where they are essential for the binding of the adsorbent. FTIR spectra of CAC and OPFAD samples are shown in Fig. 1.
The peaks in the region of 3,396–3,329 cm
–1 correspond 
to the hydroxyl (–OH) groups of alcohols, phenols, car -
boxylic acids, and water adsorbed onto CAC and OPFAD [4,13]. The peaks at approximately 1,562–1,590 cm
–1 for both 
CAC and OPFAD attributes to the C=C skeletal stretch-ing vibration in an aromatic ring or cyclic alkene where generally found in carbonaceous material like activated carbon [4,13]. The absorption peak at 1,054 cm
–1 can be 
assigned to C–O stretching vibrations in alcohols, phenols, acids, ethers, or esters [4,13,17]. The band at 1,376 cm
–1 
is characteristic of aromatic ring vibrations either with the bending vibrations of –OH bonds or with the sym-metric vibration of –CH bond in methyl group [13,18]. The IR peak at 2,922 cm
–1 is assigned to asymmetric C–H  
stretching [4,13].
According to the FTIR spectroscopy analysis for raw 
OPF reported in previous studies [19–21], the peaks in the region of 3,394–3,390 cm
–1 correspond to the stretching of 
OH groups, while the peaks at 2,900–2,800 cm–1 are related 
to the C–H stretching. The peaks at 1,701–1,737 cm–1 in raw 
OPF refer to the C=O stretching of hemicellulose and lignin. It can also be noticed that the peaks at 1,509–1,609 cm
–1 
indicate the C=C aromatic skeletal vibration of lignin which only appeared in raw OPF. The sharp peaks located between 893–899 cm
–1 are attributed to the β-glycosidic 
linkage of cellulose and adsorbed water in the samples.
3.2. TGA analysis
The thermal stability of CAC and OPFAD were stud-
ied by the thermogravimetric method. Derivative ther -
mal gravimetric (DTG) and thermal gravimetric (TG) 
curves of CAC and OPFAD are presented in Fig. 2. DTG is used to measure the rate of weight loss, while TG is used to measure the weight loss of substances concerning the temperature of thermal degradation [22].
The decomposition of CAC takes place in two stages. 
The first stage, which occurs at a temperature ranging from 29.99°C to 147.48°C involves the loss of moisture present in the sample with an approximate weight loss of 11.401% [23,24]. The maximum rate of weight loss occurred at the second stage ranging from 147.48°C to 903.11°C with the percentage loss of 41.69%. This step is related to the slow thermal decomposition of organic carbon structure of hemicellulose, cellulose, or lignin [23,24].
The decomposition of OPFAD takes place in three 
stages. The initial degradation ranging from 28.94°C to 139.64°C is attributed to the weight loss of moisture in the sample at 6.850% [22]. The second degradation around 
 CAC OPFAD

139.64°C–668.04°C is the maximum rate of weight loss 
of 47.034%. The broad DTG curve indicates the release of volatile compounds resulting from the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose [22,23]. Above 668.04°C, the OPFAD samples exhibited a weight loss up to 904.13°C, which is related with the steady decomposition of lig-nin remained in solid residue or char with a percentage loss of 27.357% [25,26].
Based on the previous studies [18,19,27], raw OPF 
showed an initial weight loss at a temperature range between 50°C and 150°C due to the evaporation of water in cellulose fibers. In contrast, the temperature range between 150°C and 250°C was due to the depolymeriza-tion of non-celluloses, including hemicellulose and lignin. According to Al-Lagtah et al. [18], before the major peak, there was a small broad peak at 280°C indicates the presence of low molecular weight compounds, hemicellulose, and lig -
nin. Owolabi et al. [27] stated that the raw OPF degraded by 70% when the samples are further heating beyond 400°C. The raw OPF samples maintained a high residual mass due to the presence of lignin and ashes within the samples. When the samples were burnt, the ashes started to regener -
ate and cause only a small reduction of the samples’ weight.
3.3. N
2-BET analysis
Surface area and porosity are the significant charac-
teristics for the adsorbent. The BET surface area, total pore 
volume, and average pore diameter of CAC, OPF, and 
OPFAD are listed in Table 1 while Fig. 3 shows the plot 
of N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm for OPFAD.
According to BET analysis, there was an improvement 
in the BET surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter from 2.0917 m
2 g–1, 0.002148 cm3 g–1, and 
4.10735 nm (for OPF) to 2.7273 m2 g–1, 0.003112 cm3 g–1, and 
4.56361 nm (for OPFAD), respectively, after chemical activa-tion. The pore structure of activated carbon can be affected by the activation temperature as it is one of the critical parameters. When the activation temperature increases, the reaction rate between the activating agent and carbons also increases [28]. Based on the average pore diameter, OPF (4.11 nm), and OPFAD (4.56 nm) can be classified as mesoporous. In comparison, CAC (1.75 nm) can be classi-fied as microporous based on the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The IUPAC classi-fied the pores as macropores (>50 nm diameter), mesopores (2–50 nm diameter), and micropores (<2 nm diameter) [29].
3.4. SEM/EDX analyses
SEM analysis was carried out to study the morphol-
ogy of OPF and OPFAD while EDX analysis was done to 
examine the main element present in OPF and OPFAD.

and their EDX spectra. As observed, the SEM images of 
OPFAD showed the existence of a larger pore size as com-pared to OPF, which is concurrence with the result obtained from BET analysis.
From Fig. 5, it shows that the samples are mainly com-
posed of carbon and oxygen. Table 2 indicates the pres-ence of C (53.72%), O (46.28%), and C (78.25%), O (16.80%) in samples of OPF and OPFAD, respectively. Notable differences were observed between the carbon content of OPF and OPFAD.
3.5. CHN analysis
The elemental compositions of CAC, OPF, and OPFAD 
are presented in Table 3. As observed, OPFAD, compared to 
OPF and CAC, showed significant differences in the propor -
tions of the different elements. Thus, the conversion of OPF into OPFAD led to an increased carbon (41.07%–57.82%) 
and nitrogen (1.00%–1.20%) content, as well as reduced 
hydrogen (5.63%–3.74%) content. The result obtained 
corresponded well with the data attained through BET, 
SEM, and EDX analyses.
3.6. Effect of adsorbent dosage
The effect of adsorption dosage was investigated 
by ranging the OPFAD dosage from 0.01 to 5.0 g. Fig. 6 
shows that the percentage removal increases with a higher amount of OPFAD dosage, which was due to the incre-ment of accessibility for the adsorption surface area and active sites in OPFAD [5]. The percentage removal increased from 71.71% to 81.90% as the adsorbent dosage risen from 0.01 to 0.1 g. It was also seen that the percentage of removal 
started to drop from 0.5 g (72.1%) to 5 g (41.42%). However, adsorbed dye quantity (mg of MB) per gram of adsorbent (q
e) decreased (from 72.27 to 9.13 mg g–1) with the increase 
in adsorbent dosage. The explanation for this is that as the OPFAD dosage increases more than 0.1 g, there would 
be excess of unutilized adsorption sites due to the fixed 
concentration of MB used in the adsorption study. More 
specifically, increasing the loading of OPFAD beyond 0.1 g would enhance unused available adsorption sites within OPFAD, consequently decreasing the adsorption capac-
ity value. Thus, relatively higher amount of OPFAD in the 
solution results in reduced distances among the OPFAD 
particles, which makes majority of binding sites unoc-cupied [5]. Shakoor and Nasar [30] pointed out that the reduction in adsorption capacity with increased adsor -
bent dosage could be related to the inter-particles inter -
action (namely aggregation or overcrowding), resulting

in reduced available total surface area. From the results, 
the optimum dosage of OPFAD was determined at 0.1 g.
3.7. pHpzc and the effect of pH
The pHpzc indicate that the pH of the adsorbent where 
the adsorbent net surface charge is corresponding to zero. Pirbazari et al. [31] reported that cationic dye adsorption 
is favored at pH > pHpzc, due to functional groups like 
OH– and COO– are present. In contrast, the anionic dye 
adsorption is favored at pH < pHpzc as the adsorbent sur -
face is positively charged. The graph of pHfinal vs. pHinitial 
was plotted, as shown in Fig. 7. The intersection of the curves with the straight line is known as the endpoint of the pH
pzc with a value of 6.44 for OPFAD. Thereby, this 
indicated that the OPFAD surface was positively charged at pH < 6.44 and negatively charged at pH > 6.44 [16].
Fig. 8 shows the effect of pH on MB removal by 
OPFAD and its q
e value. It was observed that pH gives a 
notable influence on the adsorption process. MB is a cat-ionic dye and exists in the form of positive charge ions in an aqueous solution. The surface charge on the adsor -
bent primarily influences the degree of adsorption of the charged particle onto the adsorbent surface; in other words, it is influenced by the pH of the solution [31]. As shown in Fig. 8, the removal percentage was minimum at pH 4 (64.4%) and maximum at pH 12 (84.31%). Due to the presence of excess H
+ ions competing with the cation 
groups on the dye for adsorption sites, it will lower the percentage removal of MB at acidic pH (pH < pH
pzc) [4,31]. 
On the other hand, at higher solution pH (pH > pHpzc), 
the OPFAD possibly be negatively charged and enhance the positively charged dye cations through electro-static forces of attraction [16,31]. From the results above, the optimum pH of OPFAD was determined at pH 12.

3.8. Effect of contact time
The contact time is inevitably a fundamental parame-
ter in all transfer phenomena such as adsorption. The effect 
of the contact time of OPFAD on the removal of MB is shown in Fig. 9. From the obtained result, it is noticeable that the removal of MB increased with prolonged contact time. This phenomenon was observed due to the vacancies of active sites on the adsorbent surface and high solution concentration [2]. It was noted that after 24 h contact time, the percentage of removing MB was the highest (81.9%). Therefore, the contact time 24 h was selected for further study.
3.9. Effect of initial MB dye concentration
One of the critical factors for effective adsorption is 
to consider the rate of adsorption of the initial concentra-
tion of the adsorbate. The effect of initial concentration on the adsorption and dye removal efficiency is presented in Fig. 10. The result indicates that the percentage removal and actual amount of MB dye adsorbed per unit mass of OPFAD increased with an increase in the initial MB dye concentration. This is because as the initial dye concen-tration increases, the driving force of the concentration gradient will also increase [32]. The percentage removal for MB dye risen from 69.9% to 82.8% as the MB concen-tration increased from 5 to 40 ppm. As observed, there is a decrease in percentage removal from 60 ppm (82.2%) to 
100 ppm (81.9%). This result may be attributed to the lack of available active sites required for the high initial concen-tration of the dyes [4]. The adsorption sites absorbed the available solute more quickly at low concentration [4,33].
3.10. Adsorption isotherms
The equilibrium of adsorption for the solid–liquid sys-
tem is one of the prime physico-chemical aspects in describ-
ing adsorption behavior [33]. In this study, three models 
of Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm are evaluated.The Langmuir isotherm is based on the presumption 
of monolayer adsorption onto a surface containing adsorp-
tion sites, whereby once the system achieved saturation, 
there will be no further adsorption occurred [34]. This model is the most widely used two-parameter equation, generally expressed in the form by the following Eq. (3) [33]:
C

em Lme=+11 (3)
where Ce is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate 
(mg L–1), Qe is the amount of the adsorbate per unit mass of 
adsorbent (mg g–1), KL is the Langmuir adsorption constant 
(L mg–1), and Qm is the theoretical maximum adsorption 
capacity (mg g–1).0246 81 01 2024681012pHfinal

The vital characteristic of the Langmuir equation is it 
can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless separation 
factor RL, which is defined as Eq. (4) [33].
RKCL
L=+1
10 (4)
where KL is the Langmuir adsorption constant (L  mg–1), and 
C0 is the initial dye concentration (mg L–1). The RL value 
indicates the type of the isotherm to be either favorable (0 < R
L < 1), unfavorable (RL > 1), linear (RL = 1), or irreversible 
(RL = 0).
The Freundlich isotherm, on the other hand, takes het-
erogeneous systems into account and is not restricted to the formation of the monolayer [35]. Eq. (5) gives the well-known logarithmic form of the Freundlich  
isotherm [5].ln ln QKnCeF e=+ln1 (5)
where KF (L mg–1) and n are Freundlich constants. KF is 
defined as an adsorption or distribution coefficient rep-resenting the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed on an adsorbent for a unit equilibrium concentration. At the same time, n indicates how favorable the adsorption process.
The slope of 1/n  ranging between 0 and 1 is a measure 
of adsorption intensity or surface heterogeneity, becoming more heterogeneous as its value gets closer to zero. A value for 1/n  below 1 indicates a normal Langmuir 
isotherm, while 1/n  > 1 is indicative of cooperative  
adsorption [36].
Temkin isotherm is a model that describes the effects 
of indirect adsorbate–adsorbate interactions and suggests that the heat of bio-sorption of molecules on the layer would decrease linearly instead of logarithmic with cov-erage [5]. The derivation in Temkin isotherm has been used in the form, as shown in Eq. (6) [37]:
qB AB Cee=+ln ln  (6)
where B = –RT /b, b is the Temkin constant related to the heat 
of adsorption (J mol–1), A is the Temkin isotherm constant 
(L g–1), R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1), and T is the 
absolute temperature (K).
Fig. 11 represents Qe vs. Ce graph. Langmuir, Freundlich, 
and Temkin isotherms for adsorption of MB on OPFAD are shown in Figs. 12–14, respectively.
Isotherm parameters and the determination coefficients 
were calculated and summarized in Table 4. As shown in the table, the Langmuir isotherm with the correlation coefficient of 0.9997 represents a better fit of experimental data than the Freundlich model (R
2 = 0.9975) and Temkin 
model (R2 = 0.9661). It indicates that monolayer adsorp-
tion of MB dye takes place on the homogeneous surface of OPFAD. This finding was similar to other studies, for example, Langmuir isotherm was found to fit well with the experimental data in the adsorption of methylene blue by coconut bunch waste [37], apricot stones activated carbon [4], and karanj fruit hulls activated carbon [9].
Based on previous studies, the adsorption of methy-
lene blue onto apricot stones and bamboo-based activated carbon correspondingly follow the Langmuir isotherm model as it gives the best fit for the equilibrium data [4,38]. Moreover, Kannan and Sundaram [39] reported on the kinetics and mechanism of removal of methylene blue by adsorption onto various carbons, where the adsorption behavior of methylene blue onto the activated carbon pre-pared from bamboo dust, coconut shell, groundnut shell, rice husk, and straw are also best described by a monolayer Langmuir type isotherm.
The amount of computed maximum monolayer capac-
ity for the removal of MB from aqueous media by Langmuir model was found to be 95.24 mg g
–1. Moreover, the values 
of the dimensionless constant RL (0.168) indicate that the 
adsorption is favorable and somewhat irreversible.
The adsorption of Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) can be calcu-
lated using Eq. (7) [5]:52 04 06 08 01 00687072747678808284 Percentage remo val

where R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J K–1 mol–1), 
T is the temperature in Kelvin and KLo is the thermodynamic 
equilibrium constant of Langmuir isotherm for the adsorp-
tion process. KLo can be obtained through a calculation using 
data from Langmuir isotherm and expressed as Eq. (8) [5]:

where Co = 1, MMB = 319.85 g mol–1 is the MB molar mass, 
and the factor of 1,000 allows converting g to mg.
The negative value of ΔG° (–24.36 kJ mol–1) indicated 
the spontaneity of the adsorption process and energy generation during the process [9,16]. Thus, MB molecules are 
physically adsorbed onto the surface of OPFAD.
3.11. Adsorption kinetics
The study of adsorption kinetics is vital as the rate 
of adsorption, and the mechanism of adsorption can be 
obtained from kinetic studies. In order to evaluate adsorption kinetics, three common models were applied to the experi-mental data obtained from the adsorption process. These are pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order kinetic models, and Weber’s intraparticle diffusion model as shown in Eqs. (9), (11), and (12), respectively [40–42].

where k1 (min–1) and k2 (g mg–1 min–1) are the adsorption 
rate constants of pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-or -
der adsorptions, respectively; Qe and Qt are the amounts 
of dyes adsorbed at equilibrium and time t (mg g–1); h 
is the initial rate of adsorption (mg g–1 min–1), and Kp is 
the intraparticle diffusion rate constant (mg g–1 min–1/2).
The adsorption kinetics plots are shown in Fig. 15, 
and all the kinetic parameters determined are listed in Table 5. Since calculated determination coefficients are closer to unity for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model than the pseudo-first-order kinetic model (0.9995 vs. 0.7856) and 2468 10 12 14 16 18 200.2100.2110.2120.2130.2140.2150.2160.2170.2180.2190.2200.2210.222Ce/Qe (g L-1)

calculated adsorption capacity from pseudo-second-order 
model is closer to the experimental qe value (61.13 mg g–1). 
Thus, the system principally follows the second-order rate 
model. Based on previous studies, the adsorption of meth-
ylene blue onto the apricot stone and bamboo-based acti-vated carbon similarly follows the pseudo-second-order model with R
2 values of 0.999 and >0.99, respectively 
[4,38]. Additionally, the adsorption behavior of methy-lene blue onto the activated carbons fabricated from bam-boo dust, coconut shell, groundnut shell, rice husk, and straw suitably fitted the first order with intra-particle diffusion as one of the rate-determining steps [39].
A better fit with the pseudo-second-order kinetic 
model suggests that the adsorption rate is dependent more on the availability of the adsorption sites rather than the concentration of the MB dye [16]. Moreover, it also suggests that physisorption is the possible rate-de-termining step that controls the adsorption process; as such, the adsorption rate of MB and number of active sites available on the OPFAD surface show a proportional  
relationship [4,9].
Fig. 16 shows the linear plot of t
1/2 vs. Qt. If the regres-
sion of t1/2 vs. Qt is linear and passes through the origin, then 
intraparticle diffusion is the sole rate-limiting step [43]. In previous studies, such plots may present a multilinearity, which suggests that two or more steps occur [39,44,45]. In the present study, the plot also did not pass through the origin, indicating that although intraparticle diffusion was involved in the adsorption process, it was not the sole rate-controlling step. This also confirms that adsorption of MB on the adsorbent was a multi-step process involving external surface adsorption or instantaneous adsorption stage and intraparticle diffusion into the interior [45,46]. Fig. 16 suggests that the adsorption process proceeds by surface adsorption and the second phase indicates that intraparticle diffusion is the rate-limiting step. According to Cheung et al. [47], this could be explained that there were two processes that concurred the rate of dye adsorption, but only one was the rate-limiting in any time range. Since the dual nature of intraparticle diffusion plot, it confirms the presence of both surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion [39,44].
3.12. Adsorption mechanism
The results of different factors on MB dye adsorption, 
adsorption kinetics, and isotherm are summarized. The 
above analysis shows that the adsorption of methylene blue 
onto OPFAD was a complicated process, involving multiple Table 4

steps and various interactions. According to the results 
of the pH effect, electrostatic interaction existed between OPFAD and MB dye. The molecular bonding could occur between MB dye and OPFAD through surface complex-ion [48]. MB formed MB
+ ions and attracted to the OPFAD. 
However, electrostatic interaction is not the sole mecha-nism. Meanwhile, Langmuir isotherm suggests that adsorp-tion occurred on monolayer basis onto a surface containing adsorption sites [34].
Moreover, the pseudo-second-order model could fit the 
kinetics data of MB adsorption onto OPFAD, suggesting that chemisorption interactions play a dominant role during the adsorption process. Besides, Weber’s model indicated 
the presence of both surface adsorption and intraparti-
cle diffusion. Hydrogen bond or π–π stacking interaction 
between MB and OPFAD may also exist during the adsorp-tion process. This result was consistent with the analy-sis of the OPFAD by FTIR, which showed the presence of 
those functional groups. The two benzene rings contained 
in MB dye quickly form π–π stacking interaction with 
the aromatic rings in the OPFAD [48].
The interaction between OPFAD and MB is referred to 
various mechanisms, including electrostatic interaction, 
monolayer adsorption, chemisorption interactions, surface 
diffusion, intraparticle diffusion, hydrogen bonding, and 
π–π binding. The recommended mechanism diagram is depicted in Fig. 17.
4. Conclusion
This study explored the potential of OPF as a low-cost 
precursor of OPFAD. OPFAD presents a mesopores pore 
diameter with a BET average pore diameter of 4.56 nm. The operating parameters for the maximum adsorption were adsorbent dosage (0.1 g/100 mL), dye concentration (40 ppm), and time contact (24 h). Removal of MB dye is pH-dependent and maximum removal was attained at pH 12. The Langmuir isotherm model best fitted the adsorp-tion equilibrium data with a ΔG ° = –24.36 kJ mol
–1. The 
negative ΔG ° values indicated that the adsorbent of dye 
onto OPFAD was feasible and spontaneous. Meanwhile, the excellent correlation coefficient from adsorption exper -
iment suggested that the adsorption kinetics could be best described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model which

confirmed that the adsorption rate dependent on the avail-
ability of adsorption sites rather than MB dye concen-tration. On the whole, these results showed that OPFAD is an effective adsorbent and can act as an alternative to CAC for MB dye adsorption.
