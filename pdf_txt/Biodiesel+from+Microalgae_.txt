Abstrac t: Increasing demand  due to increasing population  in transport fuel will eventually lead to complete depletion of fossil fuel 
and can have severe consequences on human life which has led to discovery of many alternative energy sources. Biofuels are a 
wide range of fuels which are made from biomass. The t erm covers sources like solid biomass, liquid fuels and various biogases. 
Due to factors such as the need for increased energy security and oil price hikes, biofuels are now gaining increased public and 
scientific attention. Algae Biodiesel is a commonly u sed alternative to liquid fossil fuels that uses algae as source of energy -rich 
oils. Also, algae fuels are an alternative to common known biofuel sources, such as sugarcane and corn. From various studies it is 
found that species of algae can produce 60% o r more of their dry weight in the form of oil. Energy scarcity prompted the need for 
diverse and integrated waste to energy  solutions to meet the needs of farmers, the surrounding community, and the envi ronment. In 
this sense  research on making biofuels is  being carried out.  
 
1. Introduction  
 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the transport sector are contributing a major portion to the environmental pollution and 
global warming (Balat et al., 2010). The cost of crude oil will continue to rise due to diminish ing supply, so production of fuels 
from comparatively alternate sources will be needed in the future decades (Du et al., 2008). In this scenario, biodiesel is considered 
as the best alternative fuel (Patil et al., 2011). Bio -fuel obtained from renewable so urces can also enhance agricultural farming and 
fuel production industries (Xue et al., 2006). Oil of agricultural crops like soybean, sunflower, safflower, cotton seeds, coconut, 
peanut are investigated to be the potential alternative fuels for the diesel  engines (Demirbas et al., 2008). Studies showed that 
tobacco seeds can also be used for biodiesel production (Veljkovic et al., 2006).Biodiesel obtained from oilseeds or the animals has 
comparatively higher raw material cost .It cannot meet the present ne eds, and can be used to fulfill only small fraction of existing 
demand. Therefore microbial oils, produced by various microorganisms like fungi, yeast and algae can be considered as the pot ential 
feedstock for biodiesel production. They own high lipid cont ent and are cost effective (Meng et al., 2009). Biodiesel obtained from 
other vegetable oil has the disadvantage of poor performance in cold weather as their polyunsaturated fatty acids tends to de crease 
the stability, but algal oil has overcome this proble m due to the lower melting point of their polyunsaturated fatty acids. The biodiesel 
produced from these organisms not only have environmental benefits over the fossil fuel, but also economically competitive wi th 
the conventional petro diesel. The accumula ted oil in mostly all microalgae is mainly triglyceride (>80%), with the fatty acid profile 
rich in C16 and C18 (Meng et al.,  2009).

1. Sample collection: -Algae sample was collected near Upvan Lake, thane, (Mumbai) around 30 gm. algae were ground with motor 
and converted in powder form as much as possible. The ground algae used we re dried for 20 min at 80c in an oven for releasing 
water.20 ml each of hexane and the ether solution were taken in a beaker. It was mixed with the ground algae (dried) to obtai n oil 
and the mixture was kept for 24h for settling  
2. Biomass collection: -The biomass was collected after filtration and weighted .than the solution was heated to release hexane and 
ether solution.

 3. Mixing of catalyst and methanol :-0.25g NaOH was mixed with 24ml methanol and stirred properly for 20min.For biodiesel 
production the mixture of catalyst and methanol was poured into the algal oil in a conical flask.  
4. Trans esterification: --The reaction process is called trans esterification. The conical flask containing solution was shaken for 
an hour.  
5.  Settling: - After shaking th e solution was kept for duration of 16 h to settle the biofuel .

4.  Experimental analysis : 
 
 
1. Characterization of fuel  
The properties of fuel such as viscosity, specific gravity, moisture content, saponification value, pour point, cloud point e tc were 
measured and presented in table given below.  
 
2. Preparation of FFA  from fuel  
FFA was prepared from fuel by saponification f ollowed by acidification.  With different stoichiometric amount of NaOH, using the 
method described above saponification was done using the method described above.  After applying saponification and acidification 
free fatty acid was produced.

4. Preparation of biofuel from FFA  
1. Effect of the Methanol to FFA Molar Ratio  
            The methanol to FFA molar ratio is one of the most important parameters that affect the FFA conversion to biodiesel. The 
effect  of methanol to FFA molar ratio on conversion of FFA was determined at fixed temperature and catalyst  concentration.  
 
2. Effect of Temperature  
             Temperature has a relatively significant effect on conversion of FFA to methyl ester. By increasing temperature %FFA 
conversion was increased. At a certain temperature the conversion was relatively higher. The effect temperature on  
conversion of FFA was determined and the results are represented in Figure. From the Figure, it can be seen that the 
conversion was 98% at 60°C temperature. Further on increasing temperature, the percentage of FFA conversion does not 
increase. The optimum  temperature was 60°C.

5. Properties of biofuel  
 Physical Properties: Properties  are one of the commonly used methods to determine the standard of biodiesel. Biodiesel can 
check using properties like density, viscosity, flash point, acid value and water content.  
 
1. Density  
Figure show how to find density by specific gravity bottle. Th e density of biodiesel was found to be 0.88 (g/c.c) that density is 
a function of temperature and decreased linearly for canola methyl esters.

 Acid number is a measure and defined as the quantity of base, expressed as milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram 
of sample, required to titrate a sample to a specified end point. The acid number is a simple and direct measure of the free 
fatty acids i n B100. The free fatty acids can lead to severe issues like corrosion and may be a symptom of water in the fuel. 
The acid value after production will be low usually for the base catalyzed reactions since the base catalyst will result in 
stripping of the av ailable free fatty acids. However, it may increase with time as the fuel has the tendency to degrade due 
to contact with air or water.  
 
 
5. Results and discussion:  
 
The different  properties of the  produced algae fuel, standard  biofuel and standard diesel were  compared as shown in table.

 The FFA content  and calorific value  of produced algae fuel is comparable  with the standard biofuel and diesel which are 
available in the market.  
 However, the viscosity of algae fuel is much higher making it difficult to use and store.  
 
6. Conclusion : 
 
Algae are considered as a very efficient means of producing biodiesel.  The oil production from algae farms is scalable and feasible.  
Further research is necessary in this area to unlock full potential of algae.  Biofuels  can be used for lighting, power, heating and 
transport. Wood and grasses are considered as good   biofuels  as they grow relatively faster. Biodiesel  is produced from oil crops, 
biogas is the result of breakdown of organic matter and bioethanol is produced from crops with very high sugar content.
