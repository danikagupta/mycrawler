Abstract Photolysis of pyribenzoxim was assessed in various
aqueous solutions under sunlight. In direct photolysis, half-lives of
pyribenzoxim were 26.9 and 9.2 days for deaerated and non-deaerated distilled water , respectively. Five pho toproducts, bispyribac,
benzophenone oxime, 2-hydroxy-6-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy)benzoic acid, benzophenone, and 2-hydroxy-6-(4-hydroxy-6-methoxy-pyrimidin-2-yloxy)benzoic acid, were identified afterirradiation under a xenon lamp for 4 h. In indirect photolysis, half-lives of pyribenzoxim were 6.0, 3.6, 4.8, 2.2, 11.4, and 9.8 daysfor humic water, paddy water, rose bengal, Fenton’s reagent,furfuryl alcohol, and mixture of furfuryl alcohol and rose bengal.The photolysis rate of pyribenzoxim in Fenton’s reagent aqueoussolution was faster than other sensitizers. Furfuryl alcohol, asinglet oxygen quencher, inhibited the photodegradation ofpyribenzoxim to some extent.

Introduction
The use of pesticide is an indispensable part of modern agriculture.
Pesticides applied in agricultural fields are subjected to variousdecomposition pathways. Photolysis is one of the most importantpathways of pesticide degradation in water and air, as well as onplant and soil surfaces (Burkhard and Guth, 1979). Photolysis canbe classified as direct and indirect photolysis (Davidson, 1979).Chemicals having strong absorption in the near ultraviolet (UV) orvisible (VIS) light range can be decomposed directly by sunlight.Those having negligible light absorption can be broken down bysensitizing mechanisms. For example, chemically active oxygenspecies produced by various photosensitizers are known to beinvolved in indirect photolysis (Zhang et al., 2008; Buchalska etal., 2010). Humic substances, riboflavin, and rose bengal are wellknown examples of direct acting or active oxygen producingsensitizers (Cho et al., 1993; Schwarzenbach et al., 1993; Christoperand Irene, 1996; Gang et al., 1996; Christoper et al., 1999). TheFenton’s reagent is a powerful oxidation reagent that attractedinterest in waste water treatment, and this reagent involved thehydroxyl radical produced by mixing hydrogen peroxide withferrous salts (Laurence et al., 1999). Furthermore, furfuryl alcoholis well known as a trapping agent of singlet oxygen (Frank andJurg, 1987; John et al., 1996; Franklin et al., 1998). Variousphotolysis were carried out with photosensitizers in aqueous phase(Nowakowska et al., 2001) or soil (William et al., 1980; Parthaand Prem, 1997) to evaluate the sensitization characteristics.
Pyribenzoxim [benzophenone O-[2,6-bis(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-
2-yloxy)benzoyl]oxime] is a new postemergence herbicidedeveloped by LG chemical Ltd, Korea, in 1997 and was found tobe very effective against barnyardgrass with low application rate(Koo et al., 1997). This herbicide was registered in Asian regionsincluding China, Vietnam, Thailand, as well as Columbia, Nicaragua,Panama in South America. This chemical is relatively immobileand rapidly degraded in soil (Tomlin, 2006). Pyribenzoxim wasreported to act rapidly, showing a maximal level of inhibition inwhole plants within 24 h after treatment at the target site (Koo etal., 2000). In vitro  metabolism of pyribenzoxim with rat liver
microsome revealed the formation of hydroxylated products, andpyribenzoxim was metabolized into five metabolites viahydrolysis, oxidation, and conjugation with glucuronic acid (Kimet al., 2000; Liu et al., 2005). No significant maternal or embryonictoxicity has been found (Shin et al., 1998), and the bioavailabilityin rats was negligible, as shown by the elimination of radioactivity

with feces (88.6%) and urine (8.5%) after 168 h of treatment (Liu
et al., 2001). In vivo  metabolism of pyribenzoxim with rice
showed total residue at harvest was less than 0.1% of initial
residue, and two major metabolites were identified (Chang et al.,2011).
Little information is available in the open literature on the
photodegradation of pyribenzoxim. The present study wasconducted to determine the kinetics of sunlight photodegradationin distilled water and the effects of photosensitizers includinghumic water, rose bengal, Fenton’s reagent, and paddy water orfurfuryl alcohol as a quencher on the photodegradation rate ofpyribenzoxim.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Pyribenzoxim, benzophenone oxime, and bispyribac
sodium were kindly provided by LG Chemical (Korea). Over98% pure pyribenzoxim was used without further purification.Benzophenone (99%), humic acid sodium salt (98%), rose bengal(91%), ferrous sulfate (99%), and furfuryl alcohol (99%), werepurchased from Aldrich Chemical Co (USA). All high performanceliquid chromatography (HPLC) grade solvents and hydrogenperoxide (>28%, H
2O2) were purchased from Duksan Co.
(Korea). Distilled water was filtered through a sybron/BarnstedtNanopure II water system set at 17.8 M Ω-cm to give deionized-
distilled water. Paddy water samples were collected from anexperimental farm, Seoul National University, and filtered througha 0.2- µm membrane filter.
Theoretical maximum photolysis rate constant and minimumhalf-life. Molar extinction coefficient of the test chemical in an
aqueous solution (4.6 ×10
−6 M) was calculated from the UV/VIS
spectra of the compound measured with an HP UV/VISspectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, USA). The absorbance wasmeasured between wavelength 297.5 and 800 nm. Maximumphotolysis rate constant, ( K
pE)max, and minimum half-life, ( t1/2)min
were estimated with equations 1 and 2, respectively (US EPA,1998a).

Daily solar irradiance (L λ) between 297.5 and 1100 nm was
measured with a Li-1800 spectrometer (Li-Cor, Inc., USA).Identification of photodegradation products.  Pyribenzoxim
(1 mg) dissolved in acetonitrile + water (3+7 by volume; 10 mL)was irradiated under a xenon lamp (1000 W, LH153, SpectralEnergy Inc., USA) for 4 h. After irradiation, the sample waspartitioned three times with dichloromethane (50 mL). Thecombined organic fractions were dried over anhydrous sodiumsulfate and concentrated using rotary vacuum evaporator. The
residue was redissolved in acetonitrile (5 mL), and an aliquot
(20µL) was analyzed by HPLC. HPLC was performed using an
HP 1100 series HPLC system with an HP Zorbax phenyl column(4.6 mm ×250 mm, 5 µm). One-step linear gradient [A = water +
0.1% acetic acid, B = acetonitrile + 0.1% acetic acid: 60% A, 40%B at 0 min; 60% A, 40% B at 3 min; 30% A, 70% B at 7 min] wasemployed over 30 min at 0.7 mL min
−1. UV detection was carried
out at 247 nm. For metabolite identification, aliquots wereanalyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)(Quattro LC, Micromass, UK) at electrospray ionization (ESI
+)
mode. The source temperature, desolvation temperature, conevoltage, and capillary voltage were kept at 120, 200
oC, 28 V , and
3.29 kV , respectively. Electron multiplier voltage was 640 V . Thenebulizer gas and desolvation gas was ultrapure nitrogen set at 80and 397 L/h, respectively. MS/MS was carried out using nitrogenas collision gas. The collision energy was kept at 65.7 eV . Thecone voltage and capillary voltage were adjusted to 25 V and3.57 kV , respectively.Photolysis. Sunlight photolysis studies were conducted in Suwon
(approximately 36
ο latitude), Korea, between August 1 and 29,
2000. The aqueous solution of pyribenzoxim (4.6 ×10−6 M) was
prepared in water + acetonitrile (99+1 by volume) to dissolve thetest chemical. The solution (10 mL) was placed in a quartz tube(11 mm i.d., 100 mm length) and irradiated by sunlight. Aliquots(2 mL each) were taken in triplicates after 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14days of irradiation. The concentration of pyribenzoxim wasanalyzed in the same manner as mentioned above. Controlsolutions wrapped with aluminum foil were treated and analyzedin the same manner. To study the effects of aeration on photolysis,each test solution (4.6 ×10
−6 M) from the above experiments was
deaerated with nitrogen gas for 10 min.
To investigate the effects of sensitizers and quencher, an
aqueous solution of pyribenzoxim (4.6 ×10−6 M) was prepared
with rose bengal (17 mM) or synthetic humic acids according tothe US EPA method (1998b). Pyribenzoxim was also dissolved infiltered natural paddy water (0.2 µm, Waters, USA), Fenton’s
reagent, furfuryl alcohol (0.5 mM), and 0.5 mM furfuryl alcohol +17 mM rose bengal (1+1 by volume) used to determine theirphotolysis. The Fenton’s reagent was prepared by mixing ferroussulfate (100 µM) with hydrogen peroxide solution (20 mM).
Aliquots (10 mL each) of those six solutions were places in aquartz cell under sunlight as indirect photolysis. The sampling andanalysis were carried out with the same method as used in directphotolysis. Dark control solutions in direct and indirect photolysiswrapped with aluminum foil were prepared and analyzed in thesame manner.
Because the rate constants from indirect photolysis were the
sum of direct and sensitizer-dependent photolysis, sensitizedreaction rate was calculated from the following equation (USEPA, 1998b).

Results and Discussion
Photolysis constants and half-life of pyribenzoxim in distilled
water. Average daily solar irradiance and total irradiance during
the experimental period were 13.6 ×106 and 340.9 ×106 Jm−2 day,
respectively. The molar extinction coefficients of pyribenzoximwas measured for calculation of ( K
pE)max and ( t1/2)min. Pyribenzoxim
showed maximum absorbance (λ max) at 194 and 245 nm with
negligible absorbance over 330 nm. Because only the light ofwavelengths over 290 nm usually arrives onto the earth surface,(K
pE)max and ( t1/2)min were calculated with wavelengths 297.5–330
nm. The estimated ( KpE)max and ( t1/2)min were 14.4 day−1 and 0.048
days, respectively. The experimental KpE (0.075 day−1) and t1/2 (9.2
days) of pyribenzoxim in aerated distilled water showed about200-fold difference with the corresponding estimated values(Table 1).Photodegradation products. Irradiation of pyribenzoxim solution
under a xenon lamp yielded five photoproducts (Fig. 1). Theseproducts were tentatively identified by studying their massspectra. Tentative assignment of the by-products was made on thebasis of molecular ion peaks and fragment ions as obtained fromLC/MS and LC/MS/MS experiments, supported by previous
knowledge of in vitro  and in vivo metabolism studies of
pyribenzoxim (Kim et al., 2000; Koo et al., 2000).
Photoproduct M1 was identified as 2-Hydroxy-6-(4-hydroxy-
6-methoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy)benzoic acid (DesMe-HDB)
according to its mass spectrum, with a protonated molecule peakat m/z 279 [MH]
+ and characteristic ion fragment peaks at m/z 261
[MH+-H2O] in addition to two other ion peaks at m/z 137 and 125.
Photoproducts M2 was identified as 2-Hydroxy-6-(4,6-
dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy)benzoic acid (HDB) on the basis ofits mass spectrum containing a protonated molecule peak at m/z293 [MH]
+ and fragment ion peak at 275 [MH+-H2O] in addition
to two other ion peaks at m/z 156 and 139. Photoproducts M1 and
M2 have been found to result from the metabolism of bispyribacin rats (Fukai et al., 1995).
The mass spectrum of photoproduct M3 showed a protonated
molecule peak at 431 [MH]
+ and fragment ion peaks at 413
[MH+-H2O]. It was tentatively identified as 2,6-bis(4,6-
dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy)benzoic acid (bispyribac). Aprotonated molecule peak at m/z 198 [MH]
+ in the mass spectrum
of photoproduct M4 and three other ion peaks at m/z 180, 120, and
77 helped to identify the compound as benzophenone oxime.Photoproduct M5 was tentatively identified as benzophenone, aclassic photosensitizer (Morin and Cadet, 1994), according to itsmass spectrum, which showed a protonated molecule peak atm/z 183 [MH]
+ and a weak acetonitrile adduct ion peak at m/z 224
[M+CH 3CN+H]+. Photoproducts M3, M4, and M5 showed
identical mass spectra with their authentic compounds. Theseproducts are reported in the study of the metabolism ofpyribenzoxim in rats and rice (Liu et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2011).After the identification of the various photoproducts, a tentativepathway for the photolytic degradation of pyribenzoxim in waterwas proposed (Fig. 2). This pathway includes the cleavage ofoxime ester bond yielding bispyribac (M3) and benzophenoneoxime (M4). Photoproduct M2 (HDB) may be formed from M3by hydrolysis, and O-demethylation of photoproduct M2 yielded
M1 (DesMe-HDB). Finally, photo-hydrolysis of M4 gave M5(benzophenone). Only three photoproducts, bispyribac, HDB, andbenzophenone, were detected in paddy water and rose bengalaqueous solution.Direct photolysis. Sunlight photolysis of pyribenzoxim was
performed to study the reaction kinetics. Direct photolysis wascarried out as follows: deaeration by nitrogen gas and nondeaeration.Direct photolysis rate constants of pyribenzoxim at deaerated andnon-deaerated samples were 0.026 and 0.075 day
−1, respectively
(Table 1), indicating that oxygen promoted the photolysis rate byabout three times more (Table 1 and Fig. 3). All these values wereadjusted by dark reaction.Indirect photolysis. Photolysis of pesticides in aqueous solutions
and on soil and plant surfaces can be altered by various chemicalsincluding humic substances, amino acids, and metals (Kanner andFennema, 1987; Schwack et al., 1994; Aguer and Richard, 1996;Choudhury and Dureja, 1997; Faure and Boule, 1997; Mazellier etTable 1 Theoretical and experimental direct rate constants and half-lives

al., 1997; Misra et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1998). Some chemicals
can generate active oxygen species such as singlet oxygen,superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide thatundergo oxidative photodegradation of pesticides.
In the present study, sensitized photodegradation of pyribenzoximwas measured in aqueous solutions containing humic acid, rosebengal, and Fenton’s reagent as well as in filtered natural paddywater. The photolysis rates of pyribenzoxim were slightlyincreased in humic acid, rose bengal, paddy water, and Fenton’sreagent as compared with those in distilled water.
The photodegradation processes followed pseudo-first order
kinetics except degradation in solutions containing rose bengaland Fenton’s reagent, possibly due to decrease of produced singletoxygen from these reagents (Table 2 and Fig. 4A). The half-life ofpyribenzoxim in Fenton’s reagent aqueous solution had about 4-fold difference with the corresponding value in distilled water(Tables 1 and 2). A significant degradation of pyribenzoxim wasobserved under Fenton’s reagent solution, because the ferrous ion(Fe
2+) acted as a catalyst producing hydroxy radical (OH) from
hydroxy peroxide (H 2O2) (Fig. 4A).
Furfuryl alcohol is well known to be quencher as a trapping
agent of singlet oxygen (Frank and Jurg, 1987; John et al., 1996;Franklin et al., 1998). Effects of furfuryl alcohol and rose bengal/furfuryl alcohol mixture on photolysis of pyribenzoxim werestudied. Furfuryl alcohol inhibited the photodegradation ofpyribenzoxim to some extent (Table 2 and Fig. 4B). The half-lifeof pyribenzoxim increased slightly in the furfuryl alcohol aqueoussolution (Table 2).

The ratios of sensitized ( Ks) and direct ( Kd) photolysis constants
indicate the effectiveness of sensitizers on photolysis. Sensitized
photolysis of pyribenzoxim in humic water, rose bengal, Fenton’sreagent, and paddy water aqueous solution was approximately0.5–3.1 times faster than by direct photolysis (Table 3). Theresults suggest that photolysis of pyribenzoxim may vary in theenvironment due to the variability of natural sensitizers, quenchers,and oxygen in natural waters. Chemical sensitization can be themain driving force of photodegradation of pyribenzoxim in theenvironment.
In conclusion, the photodegradation of pesticides in water is an
area of interesting research and is known to play an importantrole. We observed that Oxygen in aqueous solution was found toaccelerate the photolysis rate of pyribenzoxim in direct photolysisexperiment. Effective degradation of pyribenzoxim was feasibleby photolysis in the presence of some sensitizers. The photolysisrate of pyribenzoxim in Fenton’s reagent aqueous solution wasfaster than those of other sensitizers due to the sunlight irradiationenhanced the efficiency of the Fenton’s reagent (Gustavo andDamia, 1998). Furfuryl alcohol inhibited the photodegradation ofpyribenzoxim due to the quenching effect of singlet oxygen.
Pyribenzoxim, in aqueous solution, was photo-degraded via
cleavage of oxime ester bond to give bispyribac and benzophenoneoxime, which, in turn, were photolyzed into HDB and DesMe-HDB, and benzophenone, respectively. LC/MS was successfullyemployed for the identification of photoproducts, and MS/MStechnique was proved to be an excellent and powerfulsupplementary tool for confirming the identity of photoproducts.
