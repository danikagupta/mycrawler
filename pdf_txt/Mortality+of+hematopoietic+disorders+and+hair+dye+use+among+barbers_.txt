Introduction
Barbers and hairdressers are often exposed to
hairdressing products that contain many chemicalsubstances. Many epidemiological studies have beenconducted so far based on the possibility that thesechemical products may have somewhat harmful effectson health (Kono et al., 1983; Shibata et al., 1989;Schumacher et al 1989; Kato et al., 1990; Skov et al.,1990; 1994; Silverman et al 199l; Pukkala et al., 1992;Boffetta et al., 1994; Miligi et al., 1999; Teschke et al1997;  Sugiura et al 2000; Czene et al 2003; Ji et al 2005).Positive associations with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma(Boffetta et al 1994) and urinary bladder (Schumacher etal 1989) cancer, but not other sites, have been reported.
In Japan, there have been few such studies on the health
of barbers and/or hairdressers (Kono et al 1983; Shibataet al 1989; Kato et al 1990; Sugiura et al 2000). We haveconducted earlier studies on hematopoietic diseases in thecohort of the current study, but found that the mortalitywas lower than in the general Japanese population (Shibataet al 1989; Sugiura et al 2000). In the current study wepresented the mortality experience of a cohort of barbersin Aichi Prefecture over  27 years and examined for any

Barbers have frequent occasion to come in contact with hair and beauty products that contain many chemical
substances, which could have harmful effects on health.  Subjects were barbers belonging to the Barbers’ Unionof Aichi Prefecture who responded to a questionnaire in 1976. Deaths from all sites of cancers in the subjectswere observed over 27 years.  Mortalities of several cancers in the subjects were compared with individuals inthe Japanese population, calculating standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) using the general Japanese populationas a standard.  Subjects included 8,360 people (4,674 men). There were a total of 551 deaths (469 men) duringthe follow-up period, and 277 deaths (211 men) from all cancers. The male and female SMRs (95%CI) were 0.62(0.58-0.66) and 0.25 (0.16-0.34) for all deaths, 0.46 (0.39-0.53) and 0.41 (0.35-0.53) for all cancers combined, 0.49(0.35-0.63) and 0.40 (0.12-0.68) for stomach, 0.40 (0.24-0.56) and 0.30 (0.10-0.70) for lung, 0.56 (0.39-0.73) and0.26 (0.02-0.76) for liver, 0.38 (0.16-0.60) and 0.30 (0.07-0.67) for colon, and 0.48 (0.08-0.88) and 0.22 (0.04-0.79)for blood cancers, respectively, with significantly fewer deaths than in the general population.  The femaleSMRs were 0.90 (0.74-1.06) for breast and 0.55 (0.06-1.04) for ovarian cancer, lacking significance.  Thus, noexcess mortality of any cancer sites was observed compared with the general population in both Japan overalland in Aichi Prefecture.
Key Words:   Barbers - cancer - mortality rate - cohort study
excess in mortality from specific cancer sites, including
stomach, lung, liver, colon, blood, urinary bladder, breastand ovary,  compared with the general population in Japan.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
Subjects were members of the Barbers’ Union of Aichi
Prefecture who responded to a self-administeredquestionnaire sent and sent back by mail in October 1976.The questionnaire included items on living habits, medicalhistory, and use of hair dye. Those who could not beaccurately identified by name, address, or otherinformation were not included in the study. The subjectswere followed for all causes of deaths from October 1976to December 2002 as a cohort. During the follow-upperiod, information on deaths from cancers was obtainedusing deaths’ certificates from Barbers’ Union of AichiPrefecture received. The subjects who seceded from theBarbers’ Union of Aichi Prefecture or moved out of AichiPrefecture during the follow-up period were treated ascensored cases (473 men, 363 women). We believe theinformation on vital status for all barbers of the Barber’sUnion to be reliable, because there were no material  casesRESEARCH COMMUNICATION

This study was approved by the ethics committee of
Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, andpermission to use cancer registration records was receivedfrom the Aichi Cancer Registry at the Aichi Cancer Center.
Types of Cancer Analyzed
The mortality rates were calculated with all sites of,
stomach, lung, liver, colon, blood, urinary bladder, breast,and ovarian cancers, based on the ICD-10 classifications.As the standard population, the whole Japanese populationwas used, and the data were from the Ministry of Health,Labor, and Welfare.
The number of expected deaths (E) in the cohort was
calculated stratified by gender and age (5-year age-classes)using the standard population and its mortality rates ofcancers.  The numbers of people in the cohort of eachgender and age-classes were calculated separately andmultiplied by the mortality of the standard population eachyear, and totaled for the 27-year period. Then, Standardmortality ratios (SMRs), the ratio of observed (O) toexpected (E) number of deaths, were calculated for allcancers combined, site-specific cancers. Statisticalsignificance of the SMRs was examined using chi-squaretests.

men, all SMRs were lower than unity for the major sites
of cancer, such as stomach, lung, liver, colon and blood.No excess in bladder cancer mortality was noted in thiscohort. Among women, all SMRs were again lower thanunity for the stomach, lung, liver and colon. The SMR forbreast cancer was near unity. No excess in ovary cancermortality was noted in this cohort. SMR for bladder cancercould not be calculated because no deaths were observed.
Table 4 shows observed number of cancer deaths,
expected number of cancer deaths, and SMRs, stratifiedby 3 follow-up periods. In all three 9-year periods with 9years follow-up, the number of deaths was significantlylower than in the general cohort for both men and women.
Discussion
In the present study, mortality from all cancers, and
from specific sites such as stomach, lung, liver, colon andblood cancer deaths in this cohort were significantly lowerthan in the general population for both men and women.Moreover, mortality from urinary bladder cancer in men,and from breast and ovarian cancers in women showedno remarkable elevation. These results do not support theIARC report that hairdressing is a profession that may berelated to increased cancer risk (IARC, 1993).
We speculate that low cancer mortality in Aichi
Prefecture, where this cohort study was conducted, couldmay be the main reason for the lower cancer mortalityobserved in this cohort. Kikuchi et al calculated that SMRsfor 1994 to 2002 in Aichi prefecture were lower than 1.0for male all cancers combined (0.94), male stomach (0.97),and male (0.88) and female (0.90) liver cancers, and higherthan 1.0 for female stomach cancer (1.07). SMRs for maleand female lung and breast cancer were around 1.0 andless than ones for Aichi Prefecture (unpublished data).There also seems to be a remarkable difference in cancermortality between the barbers and the general populationin Aichi Prefecture. Smoking increases risks of both lung(Wakai et al., 2006) and stomach cancers (Kikuchi et al.,2002). In spite of high rates of smokers in the subjects ofthe current study, mortality of stomach and lung cancerswere low compared with general population.
The reason why the mortality of the barbers was low
compared with general population in Aichi Prefecture andin Japan is unknown. One possible explanation is thatsome cases were not registered on vital status for allbarbers, but this seems unlikely because no cases of deathsfrom cancer in this barbers’ cohort were recorded only inAichi Cancer Registry. The healthy worker effect, whichis inherent in occupational cohort studies, may also beresponsible for a  relatively lower mortality, but the effectseems limited. The subjects of this study were barbersbelonging to the Barber’s Union in Aichi Prefecture whoresponded the questionnaire at baseline. They wereactually working as barbers and consequently relativelyhealthy compared with the general population. Anotherreason may be that most subjects were self-employedpersons working indoors and they were free fromoccupational stress. Stress weakens immune responseincluding activity of natural T-cells (Arranz et al., 2007),which increases risk of cancer (Imai et al., 2000).Although many epidemiological studies on hair dye
and various types of cancer have been conducted to date,no causal relationship has been established (Hennekenset al., 1979; Thun et al 1994; Grodstein et al 1994; LaVecchia et al 1995; Altekruse et al 1999; Gago-Dominguezet al 2001; Negri et al 2001; Zhang et al., 2004). Ourresults are not consistent with a study by Kono et al (1983),who investigated causes of death from cancer and otherdiseases in a cohort of female beauticians in comparisonwith all citizens of Fukuoka Prefecture from 1953 to 1977.They reported that only death from stomach cancer wassignificantly higher, and that there were no special trendsfor other cancers.
Epidemiologic studies have suggested a positive
association between hematopoietic diseases andoccupational exposure of hairdressers (Boffetta et al.,1994; Skov et al., 1994; Miligi et al.,1999), but the resultsare controversial. Shibata et al (1989) surveyedhematopoietic diseases in the 11 years from 1976 to 1987in the subjects of the current study, and reported that upto 1987 mortality from leukemia and malignant lymphomawere lower than in the general population. Our previousstudy followed-up the same subjects until October 1995and compared the mortality rates of hematopoieticdiseases including blood cancer with the generalpopulation.  We found that all deaths and all cancer deathswere significantly less frequent than in the general cohort,and leukemia and malignant lymphoma were somewhatless frequent.
An increased risk of breast cancer in hairdressers has
also been reported in Aichi (Kato et al., 1990). In aJapanese cohort study, Lin (Lin et al., 2005) reported anelevated risk of breast cancer in women who drank alcoholregularly compared with those who did not. In the currentstudy, breast cancer showed a relatively higher SMR thanother cancers, although it was still not higher than in thewhole Japanese population or in Aichi prefecture. Asshown in Table 2, the high rate of alcohol drinkers amongfemale subjects might also explain the relatively highmortality compared with other sites of cancers.
Previous studies have suggested that risk of cancer
mortality may differ according to the length of follow-upperiod. In Finland, Pukkala et al (1992) studied thedevelopment of cancer in male and female hairdressersfrom 1970 to 1987, by dividing the follow-up period into3 periods. They found that the risk of cancer was elevatedin the first period only, but not in the subsequent periods,and stated that the change in risk may have been associatedwith changes in working conditions in hair salons.Furthermore, Boffetta et al (1994) investigated theincidence rate of ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin’slymphoma in female hairdressers in Denmark, Sweden,Norway, and Finland. They reported that the increase inrisk differed by country, and indicated that the risk ofwork-related cancer in female hairdressers differedaccording to time and geographical factors. In the currentstudy, we examined the changes in mortality rate from allcancer deaths over three 9-year periods, but found noappreciable differences in SMRs in each period.
Our study has limitations. Approximately 10% of the
study subjects were lost to follow-up during the follow-Shuji Sugiura et al
