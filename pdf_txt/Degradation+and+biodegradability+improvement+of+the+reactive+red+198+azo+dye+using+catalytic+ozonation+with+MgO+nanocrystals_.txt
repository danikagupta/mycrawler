Aim:  The aim of this study was to investigate the degradation of an azo dye, 
reactive red 198 (RR198), by ozone, H2O2/O3, and persulfate from aqueous 
solutions.
Materials and Methods:  The application of several advanced oxidation 
processes including single ozonation, O3/H2O2, and persulfate for 
degradation of RR198 at concentration of 200 mg/L was investigated. 
The effect of various parameters including pH, H2O2, persulfate doses, 
and temperature was studied on the degradation of RR198 from aqueous 
solutions. In addition, the effects of these processes on biodegradability of 
RR198 were evaluated.
Results:  The results showed that the degradation rate was increased 
by increasing H2O2 concentration. The optimum H2O2 concentration was 
obtained in the range of 0.03 mol/L at dye concentration of 200 mg/L. 
Alkaline pH, higher temperature, and persulfate dose (12 mM) were favored 
in dye and COD removal. Moreover, compared with ozone and peroxone, 
the persulfate oxidation could achieve a higher color and COD removal 
at the same reaction time. Persulfate has greater potential to improve the 
biodegradability of RR198 solution than ozone and ozone/H2O2 process. 
Biochemical oxygen demand/COD ratio of the dye solution treated by 
persulfate, ozone/H2O2, and ozone at reaction time 40 min was 0.73, 0.63, 
and 0.59, respectively.
Conclusion:  These findings show that oxidation by persulfate is a promising 
alternative for the treatment of RR198 containing solution as a recalcitrant 
pollutant.

Wastewaters containing dyes are one of the most important 
problems that are produced by many industries including 
textile, dying, pulp, and paper.[1] Dyes have a great concern to 
the environment due to the toxicity on the aquatic organisms 
and soil and also disruption in conventional wastewater 
treatment system performance.[1‑3] Textile wastewaters, 
depending on the forms of dyes, are strongly colored and 
contain high amounts of organic matter.[4] Among the 
organic dyes, azo dyes due to their complex structures are 
resistant to biodegradation and are often toxic, carcinogenic, 
and mutagenic.[2,5,6] Thus, it is important to treat azo 
dyes containing wastewaters with appropriate methods 
before discharging into the environment.[3,7] Various 
treatment methods such as coagulation/flocculation,[8] 
biological treatment,[9] electrochemical oxidation,[10] and 
adsorption[8,11,12] have been proved to be technically feasible to 
remove dye from industrial wastewaters. Treatment of textile 
wastewaters by conventional methods such as biological,[13] 
physical, and chemical processes or a combination of each is 
inefficient for color removal.[14] The mentioned methods let to 
the production of sludge[7] and only changes pollutants phase 
from wastewater to biomass or sludge[9] which subsequently 
create other environmental problems. Advanced oxidation 
processes (AOPs) are another effective treatment method for 
treating persistent compounds from aqueous media.[15] High 
efficacy, low cost, and simplicity are the main characteristics 
of AOPs, which has caused to be accepted as a new technique 
for treating the dye‑containing wastewater.[16] Furthermore, 
the AOPs can completely mineralize the dye compounds.[17] 
This methodology is based on the generation of highly reactive 
radicals such as •OH that produces in situ. These molecules 
are nonselective oxidants and afterward that cause a sequence 
of reactions to destroy the organic compounds into inorganic, 
final products and/or in most of the cases to less harmful 
substances.[9,18,19] Ultrasonic irradiation, ultraviolet (UV)/
H2O2, Fenton oxidation, O3/H2O2, and ozonation can be also 
mentioned as the hydroxyl radical‑based AOPs (HR‑AOPs).[20] 
Ozone is a strong oxidant  (E0 = 2.07 V) that has been used 
as a principal component in most of the AOPs.[9,21] In 
recent years, persulfate (S2O82−) has been considered as 
the newest oxidant in AOPs in degradation of persistent 
organic compounds.[20,22] Activation of persulfate anions 
with heat, UV light, or metal ions such as Fe2 + can generate 
SO4•− which is a powerful oxidizing agent (E0 = 2.6 V).[23,24] 
Some of the AOPs such as Fenton’s reagent and UV/H2O2 
are H2O2 based that has nonselective reactivity for the 
most recalcitrant organic compound and high oxidation 
potential (E0 = 1.78 V).[22] Activation of H2O2 can be occurred 
using iron or UV to produce HRs (•OH).[25] Furthermore, 
sonication of hydrogen peroxide can form HRs in aqueous 
solutions.[26] Various researchers showed the feasibility of 
the ultrasonic‑assisted hydrogen peroxide oxidation process 
for decolonization of malachite green[27] and rhodamine B 
from aqueous solutions.[26] Several studies on the application 
of AOP in degradation of RR 198 have been reported. For example, Moussavi and Mahmoudi evaluate degradation and 
biodegradability improvement of the reactive red 198  (RR198) 
azo dye using catalytic ozonation with MgO nanocrystals[16] 
or Tabrizi et al. studied the ozonation of textile RR198 dye in 
a CSTR.[28] Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there 
was no literature on the application of O3/H2O2 and persulfate 
for the degradation of RR 198 dye‑containing wastewaters. 
Therefore, the application of several AOPs including single 
ozonation, O3/H2O2, and persulfate for degradation of 
RR198 was investigated in the present work. The effect of 
various parameters including pH, H2O2, persulfate doses, and 
temperature was studied on the degradation of RR198 from 
aqueous solutions. In addition, the effects of these processes 
on biodegradability of RR198 were evaluated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
RR198 was obtained from Alvan Sabet Co. (Iran). The 
chemical structure and characteristics of the dye are 
presented in Figure  1 and Table  1, respectively. NaOH 
and H2SO4 (analytical grade), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 
30%), potassium iodide  (KI, 99.0%), manganese 
dioxide (MnO2), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3, 99.0%), 
sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8, 99.0%), HgSO4, and AgSO4 
were purchased from Merck Co  (Germany). The stock dye 
solution (1000 mg/L) was prepared by dissolving 1 g of RR198 
in 1 L of distilled water. The desired dye concentration was 
provided with dilution of stock solution by distilled water.
Analytical methods
The concentration of RR 198 was determined by UV/visible 
spectrophotometer (DR 5000 Hach) at the maximum 
absorbance wavelength, 518 nm. The measurement of 
chemical oxygen demand (COD) was carried out with

Because the hydrogen peroxide interferes with the accuracy 
of COD test, the excess of hydrogen peroxide was removed by 
adding MnO2 into the solution.[30] The pH measurement was 
determined using electrode method (SensION 378, Hach).
Experiments
Ozonation experiment
Ozonation process was conducted with 200 mL of dye 
solution (200 mg/L) into a plexiglass cylindrical container 
with total volume of 500 mL. The solution pH was first 
regulated by 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M H2SO4 to the desired 
values (6–10). The ozonation was then performed by 
ozone dose of 0.25 g/h (Ozone generator, OWA 1000 
Japan) for 40 min at 25°C. The samples were finally taken 
during the process in time intervals of 10 min and were 
analyzed.
O3/H2O2 experiment
The O3/H2O2 process, such as the above experiments, 
was carried out by 200 mL of dye solution (200 mg/L) 
at 25°C. First, after the adjustment of the solution pH 
to the above‑mentioned values, various dosages of H2O2 
(0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 mM) were then added to the 
solution. Afterward, the ozonation was performed with dose 
of 0.25 g/h for 40 min and the sampling was finally taken 
during the process in time intervals of 10 min.
Persulfate experiment
The decolorization experiments by persulfate radicals were 
done through addition of sodium persulfate to 200 mL of 
the dye solution (200 mg/L) into a cylindrical batch reactor 
with a magnetic stirrer. Various doses of persulfate (0, 4, 6, 
8, 12, 14 mmol) were poured into the reactor after solution 
pH adjustment (3–10). To activate the persulfate radicals 
of the solutions, the solutions were raised to the desired 
temperatures (25°C, 60°C, and 70°C) by an experimental 
hot plate stirrer. The samples were finally taken and analyzed 
such as the above.
RESULTS
Effect of solution pH in ozonation process
Solution pH is an important factor in the degradation of 
dyes from wastewaters. The effect of initial solution pH on 
the degradation and COD removal of RR198 was studied 
at pH values ranging from 6 to 10, under constant reaction 
time and ozone dosage in single ozonation process. The 
effect of solution pH on dye and COD removal in single 
ozonation is shown in Figure 2. As shown in Figure  2, the 
percentage of color removal in the ozonation process was 
decreased from 93% to 86%, with increasing solution pH 
from 6 to 7 and then it was gradually increased to 99% at 
solution pH of 10.Effect of H2O2 concentration
Figure  3 shows the performance of O3/H2O2 process on 
the color and COD removal at different doses of hydrogen 
peroxide under pH 8 and contact time 40 min at 25°C. As 
shown, the color and COD removal were slightly enhanced 
with increasing H2O2 dosage. Maximum color  (100%) and 
COD  (55%) removal were achieved in 0.03 mmol H2O2 
dosage. Hence, in this study, the optimum concentration of 
H2O2 was found to be 0.03 mmol in O3/H2O2 experiments. 
This removal efficiency can be explained as the production 
of more oxidizing radicals in the presence of a higher dosage 
of H2O2.[31] As shown in Figure  3, further doses of H2O2 led 
to a decrease in COD removal efficiency.
Effect of initial dye concentration
The effect of dye concentration (200–1000 mg/L) was 
investigated on the color and COD removal in H2O2/O3 
process at 25°C. Other parameters including pH 8, contact 
time 40 min, and H2O2 concentration 0.03 mmol were 
constant during the process. As presented in Figure  4, the 
color and COD removal efficiency are inversely proportional 
to the dye concentration used in the experiment. The removal 
efficiency of COD and color showed a similar reduction 
trend. By increasing RR198 concentration from 200 mg/L to 
1000 mg/L, COD and color removal efficiency were decreased 
from 69% to 43% and from 100% to 88%, respectively. Figure  4 
also shows that the value of COD removal is lower than color 
removal. Thus, longer time and higher ozonation dose would 
be required for significant COD removal.
Effect of initial pH on persulfate oxidation
The effect of solution pH on the color and COD removal 
using persulfate oxidation at 25°C is shown in Figure  5. As 
shown, the color removal was increased with increasing the 
initial solution pH. The color removal percentage at pH 3 
was 90% and reaching a maximum removal of 100% when pH 
was increased to 10. Further, the maximum COD removal 
was observed at pH 9. Therefore, pH 9 was considered as the 
optimum condition for persulfate oxidation.

Figure  6 illustrates the effect of temperature (25°C, 60°C, 
and 70°C) on the color and COD removal of RR198 by 
persulfate process. The experiments in this phase were carried 
out in reaction time 40 min, RR198 concentration 200 mg/L, 
the optimum persulfate dosage 12 mM, and pH of 9. As shown 
in Figure  6, the color removal by persulfate was significantly 
increased as the temperature was increased. Approximately 98% 
of the color removal was achieved by persulfate oxidation in 
40 min at 70°C. The effect of temperature on the COD removal 
through persulfate oxidation such as color removal showed a 
similar trend but in slower rate. Lower COD removal than that of 
color removal may be due to short reaction time. The maximum 
COD removal of 64% was achieved in 40 min at 70°C.
Effect of persulfate dosage
The influence of persulfate dose on the color and COD 
removal at the temperature of 70 °C is shown in Figure  7. 
As seen, by increasing the persulfate dosage from 4 mmol to 
12 mmol, the color and COD removal were increased from 
55%–97% to 30%–67%, respectively, within 40 min of reaction time. However, further increasing in persulfate dosage from 
12 mmol to 14 mmol resulted in negligible improvement in 
the color and COD removal.
Biodegradability analysis for different advanced 
oxidation processes
Wastewaters that have a biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD5)/COD ratio between 0.4 and 0.8 can be significantly 
considered as biodegradable.[32] To enhance the wastewater 
biodegradability, first, different AOPs (ozone, ozone/H2O2, and 
persulfate) under the optimum condition were conducted on 
the dye solution. Then, BOD5/COD ratio was determined for 
each dye solution. Figure  8 shows the effect of these processes 
on the biodegradability of RR198 containing solutions. As 
seen, the BOD5/COD ratio for the raw dye solution (before 
using AOPs) was 0.18. The lower BOD5/COD ratio of dye 
solution shows that the solution is not readily biodegradable. 
As shown in Figure  8, the BOD5/COD ratio  (biodegradability 
rate) for the treated solutions was increased with the reaction 
time. As illustrated in the figure, persulfate has greater 
potential to improve the biodegradability of RR198 solution

BOD5/COD ratio of the 
dye solution treated by persulfate, ozone/H2O2, and ozone at 
reaction time 40 min was 0.73, 0.63, and 0.59, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The color degradation at acidic pH is related to the direct 
oxidation of ozone with the dye molecules, which is 
predominant reaction in acidic condition.[16] Higher COD 
removal at basic (alkaline) solution pH can be associated with 
the formation of HRs (•OH). In alkaline conditions, production 
of the reactive radicals is increased due to accelerating the 
rate of ozone decomposition.[33] The characteristics of the 
solution (e.g., pH, promoters, and scavengers in the reacting 
medium) determine the ozonation reaction pathway.[16,34] The 
degradation of aromatic compounds may be occurred by the 
direct oxidation and indirect radical chain type reaction.[34,35] 
T urhan and T urgut showed that decolorization of direct dye 
in textile wastewater were noticeable, due to the formation 
of HRs, at basic solution pH of 12.[35] At pH values above 
10, the decomposition of ozone leads to generation of high 
concentration of HRs in solution. The maximum COD 
removal efficiency at pH 8 can be related to the formation 
of radical species other than hydroxyls.[36] Decrease in color 
removal in the ozonation process with increasing solution 
pH from 6 to 7 can be attributed to the radical scavengers 
including CO3 and SO4 that may exist in this condition. 
These compounds can lead to reduce •OH concentration 
which results in decrease in COD removal at pH 10.[37,38]
Decrease in COD removal efficiency with increasing of 
H2O2 dosage from 0.03 mm may be due to the consumption 
of HR via scavenging effects of H2O2 and recombination 
of •OH radicals. When the available H2O2 exceeds a 
critical concentration, •OH could be depleted through the 
scavenging of •OH by excessive H2O2.[31]
Results of the previous studies confirm our result.[23] 
Generation of other radicals (e.g., hydroperoxyl) that less reactive than hydroxyl may be the other reason for this 
observation.[18] As reported by others,[39] the presence of H2O2 
into the effluent because of overuse of hydrogen peroxide 
causes an increase in COD of the effluent. It is essential to 
optimize the applied H2O2 concentration to maximize the 
treatment performance of the AOPs since the presence of 
excess H2O2 can reduce the treatment efficiency of AOPs.[34] 
Furthermore, it has been known that in comparison with 
ozonation process, COD removal is slightly decreased in 
peroxone process (O3/H2O2). This can be related to reaction 
of H2O2 with ozone to produce •OH that results in reduction 
the effective concentration of ozone. The same results 
were also reported by others.[40] The abatement of color 
and COD removal efficiency with increasing the initial dye 
concentration can be resulted from the fact that higher dye 
concentration can increase the number of dye molecules and 
possibly inorganic anions which may compete for the reaction 
with •OH radicals. Moussavi and Mahmoudi and Siddique 
et al. reported that RR198 and reactive blue 19  (RB19) 
removal efficiency were decreased by increasing the dye 
concentration during various AOPs.[16,41]
Increase in COD removal at alkaline pH in persulfate 
experiment can be attributed to the fact that at the alkaline 
pH, activation of S2O82− is occurred and more SO4− is 
produced; therefore, the oxidation capacity was increased. 
Deng et al. reported that in alkaline pH, activation of 
persulfate can occur.[20] Superoxide radicals, with small 
amount of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals, are the main 
radicals generated in the alkaline activated persulfate 
system. The base‑catalyzed hydrolysis of persulfate to a 
hydroperoxide anion and sulfate is the main approach of 
base activated persulfate. Furthermore, the HRs can be 
produced through the reaction of sulfate radicals with 
hydroxyl ions.[42] In addition, increasing COD removal at 
the alkaline pH can be related to the generation of HRs via 
the above‑mentioned approach. Zhao et al. reported that 
elevated pH enhances the removal of PAHs in soil. They 
also showed that superoxide radicals were the main radicals

contrast, Xiang et al. (2010) showed that the degradation 
rate of orange G dye by persulfate/Fe2 process was decreased 
with increases in solution pH. They also illustrated that the 
performance of persulfate/Fe2 was more efficient at the acidic 
pH than of neutral and alkaline pHs.[43] Increase of COD 
and color removal with increasing temperature confirm that 
the sulfate free radicals  (SO4•−) have been generated by 
activation of persulfate through heat energy.[22]
The higher removal efficiency of color and COD at higher 
persulfate dosage may be due to the more production of 
SO4•− in the reaction because persulfate acts as the main 
source of SO4•− radicals. Similar results have been reported 
in previous studies.[20,25,43] Although the generation of SO4•− 
radicals is increased by increasing persulfate dosage in the 
process, at the same time, the reaction of SO4•− radicals 
with each other or with various scavengers instead of target 
pollutants reactions is enhanced.[23] Therefore, insignificant 
increase in COD removal percentage can be occurred at 
higher persulfate dosage. Possible chemical scavenging 
reactions that compete with the SO4•−/RR198 interaction 
can be presented by the following reactions.[23]
SO4•− + SO4•− → S2O82− (1)
SO4•− + S8O22− → SO42− + S2O8• − (2)
The comparison of the present study with the other methods 
in the removal of color and COD is summarized in Table  2. As 
seen, persulfate oxidation is considered as an efficient process, 
especially in the removal of COD due to its higher efficiency.
Further, destruction of azo bands and aromatic rings of RR198 
by the oxidants compounds have been led to enhancement 
of the dye biodegradability. The same results were reported 
by others.[16,45]
CONCLUSION
In this study, degradation of RR198 using several AOPs 
including O3, O3/H2O2, and persulfate was studied. The effects of various parameters such as ozone, hydrogen 
peroxide, and persulfate doses, initial dye concentration, and 
solution pH at reaction time of 40 min were studied on the 
degradation of RR198. The degradation of dye was influenced 
by the initial solution pH, initial dye concentration, H2O2 
concentration, and persulfate dosage. Increasing initial 
solution pH, H2O2 concentration, and persulfate dosage 
led to enhance the dye degradation while increasing initial 
dye concentration led to a decrease the dye degradation. 
It was observed that, in comparison with other processes, 
persulfate as the newest oxidant agent caused higher COD 
removal (67%) of RR198 at reaction time of 40 min. The 
greatest biodegradability of the dye‑containing wastewater 
was also achieved by oxidation with persulfate.
