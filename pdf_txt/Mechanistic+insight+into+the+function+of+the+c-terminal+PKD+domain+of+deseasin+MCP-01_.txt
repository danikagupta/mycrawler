ABSTRACT Enzymatic degradation of collagen is of great industrial and environmental
signiﬁcance; however, little is known about thermophile-derived collagenolytic proteases.
Here, we report a novel collagenolytic protease (TSS) from thermophilic Brevibacillus sp.
WF146. The TSS precursor comprises a signal peptide, an N-terminal propeptide, a subti-
lisin-like catalytic domain, a b-jelly roll ( bJR) domain, and a prepeptidase C-terminal
(PPC) domain. The maturation of TSS involves a stepwise autoprocessing of the N-termi-
nal propeptide and the PPC domain, and the bJR rather than the PPC domain is neces-
sary for correct folding of the enzyme. Puri ﬁed mature TSS displayed optimal activity at
70°C and pH 9.0, a half-life of 1.5 h at 75°C, and an increased thermostability as the
NaCl concentration increased up to 4 M. TSS possesses an increased number of surface
acidic residues and ion pairs, as well as four Ca21-binding sites, which contribute to its
high thermostability and halotolerance. At high temperatures, TSS exhibited high activitytoward insoluble type I collagen and azocoll but showed a low gelatinolytic activity,
with a strong preference for Arg and Gly at the P1 and P1 ’positions, respectively. Both
the
bJR and PPC domains could bind but not swell collagen, and thus facilitate TSS-
mediated collagenolysis via improving the accessibility of the enzyme to the substrate.
Additionally, TSS has the ability to ef ﬁciently degrade ﬁsh scale collagen at high
temperatures.
IMPORTANCE Proteolytic degradation of collagen at high temperatures has the
advantages of increasing degradation ef ﬁciency and minimizing the risk of microbial
contamination. Reports on thermostable collagenolytic proteases are limited, andtheir maturation and catalytic mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Our results dem-
onstrate that the thermophile-derived TSS matures in an autocatalytic manner and
represents one of the most thermostable collagenolytic proteases reported so far. At
elevated temperatures, TSS prefers hydrolyzing insoluble heat-denatured collagen
rather than gelatin, providing new insight into the mechanism of collagen degrada-
tion by thermostable collagenolytic proteases. Moreover, TSS has the potential to be
used in recycling collagen-rich wastes such as ﬁsh scales.

Collagen is the most abundant protein in animals and widely distributed in various
tissues such as skin, tendons, cartilage, bones, ﬁsh scales, and nematode cuticle (1,
2). Fibrillar collagens (e.g., types I, II, III, and XI) account for approximately 90% of mam-
mal collagens and are assembled from collagen monomers, each comprising three
intertwined polypeptide chains (e.g., two a1 and one a2 chains for type I collagen)
of mainly repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets to form a right-hand triple helix (1). The triple helix
is stabilized via interstrand hydrogen bonds, the stereoelectronic effects of hydroxylatedEditor Haruyuki Atomi, Kyoto University

prolines, intermolecular cross-links, and extensive hydration networks (3). Due to its tightly
packed structure and insoluble nature, ﬁbrillar collagen is highly resistant to proteolysis
and can be ef ﬁciently hydrolyzed only by limited types of proteases such as mammalian
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and microbial collagenolytic proteases including true
collagenases capable of degrading native collagens and other proteases with collageno-
lytic activities (4 –6). Collagenolytic proteases of pathogens are important virulence factors
via degrading extracellular matrix collagens of hosts, and those of environmental microbes
play important roles in the global nitrogen cycling by hydrolyzing collagen-containing bio-
mass (5). Microbial collagenolytic proteases have been widely used in food and meat
industries, leather processing, medicine and cosmetic ﬁelds, cell preparation in the labora-
tory, etc., and enzymatic degradation is regarded as an eco-friendly approach for recycling
collagen-rich wastes (6).
The extensively studied collagenases from Clostridium histolyticum (7–10) and Vibrio
species (11 –13) are metalloproteases of the M9 family. Additionally, several bacterial serine
proteases belonging to the S8 (subtilisin) (14 –17), S1 (chymotrypsin) (18), and S53 (sedoli-
sin) (19) families, as well as some members of the U32 family without known catalytic type(20, 21), have been reported to be collagenolytic proteases. Most collagenolytic proteases
contain a catalytic domain and at least one C-terminal domain, such as the collagen bind-
ing domain (CBD), the polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain, the prepeptidase C-termi-
nal (PPC) domain, the P-proprotein convertase domain (P_domain), and the
b-jelly roll
(bJR) domain (5). The CBDs of Clostridium collagenases (8) participate in collagen binding
to facilitate collagen degradation by the catalytic domain. The PKD domain of collageno-
lytic protease MCP-01 from Pseudoalteromonas s p .S M 9 9 1 3n o to n l ya c t sa saC B Db u ta l s o
swells insoluble collagen to improve the collagenolysis by the enzyme (15).
The degradation of collagen by thermostable collagenolytic proteases at high tempera-
tures has the advantage of increasing the degradation ef ﬁciency because heat-denatured
collagen is more susceptible to proteolysis and can minimize the risk of microbial contami-
nation (22). To date, only a few thermophile-derived collagenolytic proteases have been
characterized. The thermostable collagenolytic protease MO-1 from thermophilic Geobacillus
collagenovorans MO-1 belongs to the subtilisin family and is active in a temperature range
of 25 –80°C, with an optimum at 60°C (23). The collagenolytic serine-carboxyl proteinase
(kumamolisin-As) of thermoacidophilic Alicyclobacillus sendaiensis strain NTAP-1 is a member
of the sedolisin family, and exhibits its optimum at 60°C and pH 3.9 (19). Despite lacking aCBD, kumamolisin-As possesses a substrate-binding groove with a preference for relaxed
collagen molecule under high temperature and low pH condition (24). A collagenolytic ser-
ine protease from thermophilic Thermoactinomyces sp. 21E shows a high activity toward
collagen at 60°C, but its gene remains unknown (25). Because heat treatment causes the
conversion of collagen to gelatin, enzymatic degradation of collagen at high temperatures is
considered to be related to the gelatinolytic activity of the enzyme (6). Indeed, the collage-
nolytic proteases from G. collagenovorans MO-1 and Thermoactinomyces sp. 21E exhibit
higher gelatinolytic than collagenolytic activity (23, 25). However, MO-1 has a C-terminal
CBD, implying that the binding of MO-1 to insoluble collagen substrates may contribute to
collagen degradation by the enzyme (14). The mechanism of collagen degradation by ther-
mophile-derived collagenolytic proteases remains to be elucidated.
Brevibacillus sp. WF146 is a thermophilic bacterium with an optimum growth tem-
perature of approximately 58°C (26) and has the ability to utilize ﬁsh scale collagen
(FSC) as carbon and nitrogen sources for growth (unpublished data). From strain
WF146, an extracellular subtilisin-like protease (WF146 protease) (26 –28) and an HtrA-
like protease (HtrAw) (29) have been characterized. We have obtained a draft genome
sequence of strain WF146 and identi ﬁed another gene encoding an extracellular serine
protease (named TSS) comprising a signal peptide, an N-terminal propeptide, a subtili-
sin-like catalytic domain, a
bJR domain, and a PPC domain. In this study, recombinant
TSS was produced in Escherichia coli , and its maturation was found to proceed in an
autocatalytic manner. The mature TSS was characterized to be a novel thermostable
and halotolerant protease with high collagenolytic but low gelatinolytic activity. TheZhang et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology

substrate preference of TSS, the ability of TSS in degrading ﬁsh scale collagen (FSC), as
well as the roles of its bJR and PPC domains in enzyme folding and stability, collagen
binding, and collagenolytic activity were investigated.
RESULTS
Bioinformatic analysis of TSS. The open reading frame of TSS encodes a precursor
(pre-TSS) of 750 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment analysis shows that pre-TSS
comprises a signal peptide (Met2205to Ala2180), an N-terminal propeptide (Lys2179to
Arg21), a subtilisin-like catalytic domain (Asn1to Thr318), abJR domain (Gly319to
Gly436), a linker (Glu437to Arg460), and a PPC domain (Asp461to Arg545) (Fig. 1A). TSS
shares low sequence identity ( ,20%) with reported subtilisin-like collagenolytic pro-
teases including MO-1 (14), MCP-01 (15), AcpII (16), and myroicolsin (17) and has differ-
ent domain organization (Fig. 1B).
Among characterized proteases, TSS exhibits the highest sequence identity (49%
for catalytic domain and 44% for bJR domain) with the oxidatively stable alkaline ser-
ine protease KP-43 (30), although the latter lacks a PPC domain (Fig. 1A). KP-43 con-tains three Ca
21-binding sites (Ca1, Ca2, and Ca3), and most of the ligand residues at
the three sites are conserved in TSS (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the PPC domain of TSS alsocontains a putative Ca
21-binding site (Ca4), of which the ligand residues are identical
to those of the Ca3 site of KP-43 (Fig. 1A). Despite their sequence similarity, TSS differs
from KP-43 in that TSS has a high content (16.4%) of acidic amino acid residues (Asp

and Glu), and thus a low isoelectric point (pI) value of 4.38, while KP-43 has a pI value
of 8.78. A homology modeling of TSS with mature KP-43 (comprising the catalytic and
bJR domains) as the template revealed that most of the acidic residues of TSS are dis-
tributed on the enzyme surface (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Meanwhile, 24predicted ion pairs (5 salt bridges and 19 long-range ion pairs) were found in the cata-lytic and
bJR domains of TSS, while 17 ion pairs (7 salt bridges and 10 long-range ion
pairs) were found in mature KP-43 (Table S1). Most predicted ion pairs are located onthe enzyme surface (21 for TSS and 14 for KP-43), and the other three (for eachenzyme) reside at the interface between the catalytic and
bJR domains (Table S1).
The maturation of TSS involves a stepwise autoprocessing of the N-terminal
propeptide and the PPC domain. In order to investigate the maturation process of
TSS, the recombinant proform of this enzyme (pro-TSS) and its active-site variants (pro-S257A and pro-S257C), the C-terminal truncation variants ( DP and DP’), the N-terminal
propeptide deletion variant ( DN), and the N-terminal propeptide (rN) were constructed
(Fig. 2A) and produced in E. coli . A major band with an apparent molecular weight
(AMW) of 78 kDa was detected in the total cellular protein (TCP) fraction of E. coli
expressing pro-TSS, while pro-S257A was produced as a protein with an AMW of100 kDa (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Meanwhile, both the 100- and 78-kDa products couldbe detected by immunoblot with antibody against His-tag (Fig. 2B, lower panel), whichwas fused at the C-terminus of pro-TSS or pro-S257A (Fig. 2A). When produced in E.
coli,DN or its active-site variant ( DN/S257A) was hardly detected by SDS-PAGE analysis
but could be detected by anti-His-tag antibodies, showing an AMW of 78 kDa (Fig. 2B).These results suggest that the 78-kDa product of pro-TSS is derived from the proformby autoprocessing the N-terminal propeptide. It was noticed that the production ofthe 78-kDa DNo rDN/S257A was accompanied by the appearance of many products
with smaller AMWs (Fig. 2B), implying that in the absence of the N-terminal propep-tide,DNo rDN/S257A is unable to fold properly and susceptible to degradation by
host proteases.
It is well known that replacing the catalytic Ser residue with Cys greatly reduces en-
zymatic activity of subtilisins but does not eliminate their autoprocessing activities,such that the maturation process is blocked subsequent to the ﬁrst cleavage of the

and s4) fractions of the cell lysates, as well as the heat-treated (60°C, 15 min) soluble fractions (s1 ’,s 2’,s 3’, and s4 ’), were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
immunoblot analyses. The bands corresponding to the proform (P), the intermediate (I), the mature form (M), and the N-terminal propeptide (N) are
indicated. (C) Schematic view of the maturation process of TSS. Arrowheads indicate the autoprocessing sites.Zhang et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology

N-terminal propeptide and the cleaved propeptide is not further degraded by the
mature domain (27, 30). Therefore, we constructed the pro-S257C mutant to furtherverify that the autoprocessing event occurred in pro-TSS. In the case of pro-S257C, inaddition to the 100- and 78-kDa products, a 22-kDa product was detected in the TCPfraction by SDS-PAGE but not by anti-His-tag antibodies (Fig. 2B), con ﬁrming that the
100-kDa proform is converted to the 78-kDa product by autoprocessing of the 22-kDa
N-terminal propeptide. The size of the cleaved N-terminal propeptide (22 kDa) of pro-S257C was slightly smaller than that of rN (23 kDa) (Fig. 2B), most likely due to the pres-ence of an additional His-tag in rN.
The 78-kDa product of pro-TSS was present in the soluble cellular fraction after cell
disruption in a buffer without CaCl
2, and a subsequent heat treatment at 60°C led to
the conversion of the 78-kDa product into a 58-kDa product incapable of beingdetected by anti-His-tag antibodies (Fig. 2B, lanes s1 and s1 ’). When cell disruption was
performed in a buffer with 10 mM CaCl
2, both the 78- and 58-kDa products were
detected in the soluble cellular fraction, and the 78-kDa protein was also converted tothe 58-kDa product after the heat treatment (Fig. 2B, lanes s2 and s2 ’). These results
imply that the C-terminal part of the 78-kDa product undergoes a further autoprocess-
ing event, which could be accelerated by CaCl
2. The C-terminal truncation variants DP
andDP’(Fig. 2A) were employed to probe the C-terminal cleavage site. After heat
treatment of the soluble cellular fraction, a 58-kDa protein represented the major prod-uct in the sample of either DPo rDP’by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2B, lanes s3 ’and s4 ’),
suggesting that the PPC domain is not essential for cleavage of the N-terminal propep-tide. Notably, the 58-kDa product of DP’but not that of DP could be detected by anti-
His-tag antibodies (Fig. 2B, lanes s3 ’and s4 ’), indicating that the C-terminal processing
occurs within the linker between the
bJR and PPC domains (Fig. 2A), although the
exact cleavage site(s) remains to be determined.
It is evident that the generation of the 58-kDa product, particularly in the heat-
treated samples, was accompanied by the degradation of host proteins (Fig. 2B, laness1’,s 2’,s 3’, and s4 ’), suggesting that the 58-kDa product is the active mature form of
the enzyme. It seemed that the active mature form also mediated the cleavage of the
fused His-tag in the 78-kDa product of pro-TSS and the N-terminal propeptide-cleaved
product of DP(;61 kDa), which could not be detected by anti-His-tag antibodies
(Fig. 2B, lanes s2 and s3). In addition, the immunoblot analysis also revealed somebands with AMWs larger than 100 kDa and smaller than 78 or 58 kDa (Fig. 2B), prob-ably representing the aggregation forms and the degradation products of the enzyme.
The above results demonstrate that the N-terminal propeptide of pro-TSS is auto-
processed to yield the intermediate (iTSS), of which the PPC domain is then autopro-
cessed to generate the mature form (mTSS) comprising the catalytic and
bJR domains
(Fig. 2C). It is worth mentioning that the AMWs of pro-TSS (100 kDa), iTSS (78 kDa), andmTSS (58 kDa) are higher than their predicted molecular weights (79, 59, and 47 kDa,respectively), which is a common feature of proteins with a high content of acidic resi-dues (31).
TSS is a Ca
2+-dependent thermophilic alkaline protease with high halotolerance.
Puriﬁed mTSS was denatured by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) treatment and then subjected
to SDS-PAGE analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, in addition to the 58-kDa mTSS, two minorbands with AMWs of ;34 and ;25 kDa were also present in the puri ﬁed sample (lane
1), and the two bands became more evident in the 5-fold concentrated sample (lane 2).
When the concentrated sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE without TCA pre-treatment,
mTSS displayed an AMW of 22 kDa and exhibited proteolytic activity in a gelatin overlayassay; meanwhile, the 34- and 25-kDa bands disappeared (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 5). The58- and 22-kDa bands represent the denatured and folded forms of mTSS, respectively,and the compact folded form migrates faster than the denatured form during electro-phoresis in the gel. For the 34- and 25-kDa bands, they are most likely the self-cleavedproducts of mTSS and may form a nicked enzyme in a folded state similar to intact mTSSunder non-denaturing conditions.A Thermostable Collagenolytic Protease TSS Applied and Environmental Microbiology

The optimal temperature for the activity of mTSS against azocasein or azocoll was deter-
mined to be 70°C (Fig. 3B). Using azocasein as a substrate, mTSS displayed pH optimum of9 . 0( F i g .3 C ) .I nt h ep r e s e n c eo f1 0m MC a C l
2at pH 9.0, mTSS retained more than 80% or
70% of the original activity after 8 h of incubation at 60°C or 70°C (Fig. 3D), and showed a
half-life of 1.5 h at 75°C (Fig. 3E). At pH 11.0 and pH 7.5, the enzyme was also highly stable at6 0 ° Ci nt h ep r e s e n c eo fC a C l
2, with half-lives of 2 h and more than 12 h, respectively (Fig.
3D). In contrast, in the absence of CaCl2the half-life of mTSS decreased to 6 min at 70°C and
pH 9.0 (Fig. 3D). When the residue Glu187of the Ca1 site in the catalytic domain was replaced
by Ala, the resulting variant E187A was completely inactivated after incubation at 70°C for3 h, while mTSS retained 82.5% of the original activity under the same condition (Fig. 4D).These results suggest that TSS is a Ca
21-dependent thermostable alkaline protease.
Similar to haloarchaeal proteins, TSS contains a high content of acidic amino acid
residues and has a low pI value, leading us to investigate the effects of high salinity onits stability and activity. After 4 h of incubation with 1 –4 M NaCl at 75°C, mTSS retained
approximately 60 –80% of the original activity, which is much higher than that in the
absence of NaCl ( ;20%) (Fig. 3E), indicating that NaCl could enhance its thermostabil-
ity remarkably. The salinity dependence of mTSS activity was determined in the pres-
ence of 0 –3 M NaCl. Interestingly, the salt-dependence of azocaseinolytic activity of
mTSS displayed an inverted bell-shape curve, i.e., the activity showed an initialdecrease followed by an increase, with a minimum at 1 M NaCl (Fig. 3F). When N-succi-nyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe- p-nitroanilide (suc-AAPF- pNA) was used as the substrate, the activ-
ity of mTSS continuously increased with rising salinity up to 3 M (Fig. 3F). These resultssuggest that TSS is highly halotolerant and its activity depends on both salinity andsubstrate type.

ThebJR domain contributes to the folding, stability, and activity of TSS. The
PPC domain deletion variants ( DP and DP’) could be produced as soluble forms and
processed to active forms (Fig. 2), indicating that the PPC domain is not necessary forthe folding, maturation, and activity of TSS. In contrast, the variant D
bP, which lacks
both the bJR and PPC domains (Fig. 2A), was present in the insoluble cellular fraction
ofE. coli (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). When solubilized in 8 M urea and puri ﬁed, only a
minor amount of soluble DbP could be recovered after renaturation (Fig. 4A, lanes 3
and 4). The soluble DbP displayed a larger AMW (65 kDa) than that of mTSS (58 kDa)
comprising the catalytic and bJR domains (Fig. 4A and Fig. 3A), implying that the
N-terminal propeptide has not been processed from DbP. Moreover, the DbP samples
with and without pre-treatment by TCA displayed the same AMW and did not exhibit
proteolytic activity by gelatin overlay assay (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 –7), unlike the bJR domain-
containing mTSS, which displayed different AMWs before and after TCA treatment
(Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the bJR domain is required for correct folding of
an active TSS.
To probe the roles of the bJR domain in stability and activity of TSS, we site-speci ﬁ-
cally mutated six residues at the Ca2 (Asp385and Asp393) and Ca3 (Asn368, Asn370,
Asp396, and Glu402) sites. (Fig. 4B). The thermostabilities and activities of puri ﬁed var-
iants (Fig. 4C) were examined. After heat treatment at 70°C for 3 h, the residual activ-
ities of the variants D385A, D393A, D396A, and E402A were signi ﬁcantly lower than
that of mTSS; meanwhile, the four variants showed a decrease in azocaseinolytic activ-
ity (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that the Ca2 and Ca3 sites in the bJR domain con-
tribute to the thermostability and activity of TSS.

(lane 1) and insoluble (lane 2) fractions of the cell lysate of E. coli producing DbP were separated by centrifugation. The recombinant DbP in the insoluble
fraction was solubilized in 8 M urea and puri ﬁed (lane 3), followed by renaturation to recover soluble DbP (lanes 4 to 7). The samples before (lanes 5 and

The Ca3 site of TSS is conserved in the bJR domains (as in KP-43, myroicolsin, and
Tk-SP subtilisin) and the PPC domain (as in pyrolysin) of some homologous proteases;however, two conserved Asp residues in this Ca
21-binding site of these homologous
proteases are replaced by Asn residues (Asn368and Asn370) in TSS (Fig. 4B). When the
residue Asn368or Asn370of TSS was replaced by Asp, the resulting variant N368D or
N370D showed a decrease in thermostability (Fig. 4D), implying that the introduction
of a negatively charged carboxyl group into the Ca3 site destabilizes TSS.
TSS possesses high collagenolytic but low gelatinolytic activity at high
temperatures. Using azocoll, type I collagen, azocasein, and casein as the substrates,
the activity of mTSS was compared with that of C. histolyticum collagenase (ChC). At
37°C, mTSS exhibited lower activity against azocoll (Fig. 5A) and type I collagen than
ChC (Fig. 5B). When the temperature was increased from 37°C to 60°C, the activity ofmTSS increased sharply by approximately 20- and 118-fold for azocoll (Fig. 5A) and
type I collagen (Fig. 5B), respectively. In contrast, the activity of ChC against the two
substrates decreased as temperature was increased from 37°C to 60°C (Fig. 5A and B),most likely due to the destabilization of the mesophilic ChC at elevated temperatures.
The activity ratios of mTSS and ChC for different substrates, namely, the azocoll/azo-
casein and collagen/casein ratios, were determined to compare the substrate preferen-ces of the two enzymes at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, the azo-
coll/azocasein and collagen/casein ratios of mTSS at 60°C (5.40 and 2.48) were much
higher than those at 37°C (0.84 and 0.05), indicating that thermal denaturation of col-lagenous substrates greatly facilitates their degradation by TSS. In the case of ChC, it
showed lower azocoll/azocasein and collagen/casein ratios at 60°C (0.42 and 1.40) than
at 37°C (1.18 and 2.34) (Fig. 5A and B), con ﬁrming that this enzyme acts as a native col-
lagen-preferring collagenase. Moreover, the azocoll/azocasein and collagen/casein
ratios of mTSS at 60°C were higher than those of ChC (5.40 versus 0.42 and 2.48 versus
1.40) (Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that in contrast to ChC, TSS prefers to hydrolyze dena-tured collagenous substrates at elevated temperatures. Consistent with this, TSS
showed an increased activity toward heat-treated compared to untreated type I colla-
gen (Fig. 5D).
To investigate whether the observed high collagenolytic activity of TSS at elevated
temperatures is mainly due to its gelatinolytic activity, the activities of mTSS toward type
I collagen and gelatin were determined at 60°C and compared with those of ChC. Forcomparison purpose, here the collagenolytic reaction, as in the gelatinolytic reaction,
was terminated by TCA treatment, and the acid-soluble peptides were quanti ﬁed for ac-
tivity determination. Intriguingly, mTSS exhibited approximately 10-fold lower gelatino-lytic than collagenolytic activity, while ChC showed similar levels of gelatinolytic and

determined at 37°C or 60°C in buffer B (for mTSS) or buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5; for ChC) and were used for calculation of the azocoll/
azocasein, collagen/casein, and gelatin/collagen ratios. The activities of the enzymes against type I collagen were determined by either water-so luble
peptides quanti ﬁcation (B) or acid-soluble peptides quanti ﬁcation (C, indicated by “#”), as described in Materials and Methods. (D) Degradation of heat-

collagenolytic activities (Fig. 5C). As a result, the gelatin/collagen ratio of mTSS was only
9.8% that of ChC (0.10 versus 1.02) (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrate that the highcollagenolytic activity of TSS results from its preference for heat-denatured collagen
rather than a high gelatinolytic activity. Additionally, the collagenolytic activity of mTSS
measured at 60°C by acid-soluble peptides quanti ﬁcation (950 U/mg, Fig. 5C) was
approximately 25% of that by water-soluble peptides quanti ﬁcation (3782 U/mg,
Fig. 5B). In contrast, under the same conditions, the collagenolytic activity of ChC meas-
ured by acid-soluble peptides quanti ﬁcation (391 U/mg, Fig. 5C) was approximately 56%
of that by water-soluble peptides quanti ﬁcation (694 U/mg, Fig. 5B). These data show
that the hydrolyzed collagen peptides by TSS are more easily precipitated with TCA than
those by ChC, re ﬂecting a different catalytic behavior toward collagen between the two
enzymes.
The digestion patterns of type I collagen and
b-casein by mTSS were compared
with those by ChC. When type I collagen was incubated alone at 60°C for 1 h, only a
small number of a1,a2, and b(dimer) chains of collagen could be detected in the
soluble fraction; in contrast, a large amount of collagen degradation products cleaved
by mTSS or ChC were released into the soluble fraction (Fig. 6A). Evidently, the diges-
tion pattern of type I collagen by mTSS was different from that by ChC (Fig. 6A).
Meanwhile, the digestion pattern of b-casein by mTSS and ChC were also different
(Fig. 6B). These results con ﬁrm that mTSS and ChC differ in their substrate cleavage
speci ﬁcity.
We next investigated the cleavage sites of insoluble and thermally solubilized type I
collagen by mTSS at 60°C. By LC-MS/MS analysis of the digestion products, 130 and 83
peptides released from the insoluble and solubilized type I collagens, respectively,
were identi ﬁed (Tables S2 to S5), suggesting that the insoluble substrate is digested
more ef ﬁciently than the solubilized substrate by mTSS. Accordingly, a total of 133 and
100 cleavage sites were determined in the insoluble and solubilized collagens, respec-
tively (Fig. 7). For the two forms of substrates, 76 cleavage sites are shared by them,while 57 and 24 sites are present only in insoluble and solubilized substrates, respec-
tively (Fig. 7), re ﬂecting a similar but not identical digestion pattern of the two sub-
strates by mTSS. In insoluble collagen, the P1 position is mainly occupied by Arg
(;50%), Ala ( ;15%), and Lys ( ;9%), and the P1 ’position is almost strictly occupied by
Gly (;78%); in solubilized collagen, Arg and Gly are also the most common residues at
the P1 (54%) and P1 ’(77%) positions, respectively (Table 1). Moreover, type I collagen
contains a total of 85 Arg-Gly peptide bonds, of which ;71% and ;56% in its insoluble
and solubilized forms, respectively, are cleaved by mTSS (Fig. 7). These results suggest

gen and azocoll were investigated at 0°C to prevent substrate breakdown as much as
possible (14). As shown in Fig. 8A, most mTSS molecules bound to type I collagen orazocoll were precipitated with the substrates, while approximately 17% (for type I col-lagen) or 40% (for azocoll) of mTSS molecules remained in the supernatant. As a con-trol, bovine serum albumin (BSA) did not exhibit signi ﬁcant collagen-binding capacity
under the same condition (Fig. 8A). Puri ﬁed recombinant
bJR (rbJR) and PPC (rPPC)
domains (Fig. 2A) are able to bind to type I collagen at both 0°C and 60°C, although
partial solubilization of the substrate occurred at 60°C (Fig. 8A). Green ﬂuorescent pro-
tein (GFP)-fused bJR (GFP- bJR) and PPC (GFP-PPC) were also constructed (Fig. S2). In
contrast to the GFP-treated type I collagen, the GFP- bJR- or GFP-PPC-treated type I col-
lagen showed yellow-green color (Fig. 8B), con ﬁrming the collagen-binding ability of
thebJR and PPC domains. We next investigated whether r bJR and rPPC have colla-
gen-swelling ability. It was found that the volume of type I collagen was not changedsigni ﬁcantly after treatment with r
bJR or rPPC at either 37°C or 60°C (Fig. 8C), implying
the two domains could not swell the substrate. Moreover, the activity of mTSS againstr
bJR- or rPPC-treated type I collagen was not improved as compared with that against
untreated type I collagen (Fig. 8D).
Degradation of FSC by TSS. FSC was prepared from scales of grass carp as dried
powder (Fig. S3). Like the case of type I collagen from bovine Achilles tendon (Fig. 6A),FSC could be partially solubilized at 60°C, as evidenced by the gradual reduction of
FSC volume (Fig. 9A), the increase of the number of soluble peptides (Fig. 9B), and the
emergence of
a1,a2, and bchains in the soluble fraction with the extension of the
incubation time (Fig. 9C). In the presence of mTSS, the volume of insoluble FSCdecreased more profoundly than that in the absence of mTSS, and the FSC degrada-tion was accelerated with the increase of mTSS concentration (Fig. 9A and B). Within 4
h, approximately 67, 74, 80, and 83% of FSC could be degraded into soluble peptides
by 10, 20, 40, and 80
mg/mL of mTSS, respectively (Fig. 8B). Moreover, the a1,a2, and
bchains of FSC were readily degraded into smaller peptides, most of which have
migrated out of the gel (Fig. 9C). These results suggest that TSS is an ef ﬁcient degrader
of FSC at high temperatures.

(16) reveals that their N-terminal propeptides and C-terminal domains or regions have
been cleaved off; however, the maturation mechanisms of these enzymes remain to beelucidated. Here we demonstrate that the N-terminal propeptide and the C-terminalPPC domain of TSS are autocatalytically processed in a stepwise manner, yielding themature form mTSS comprising the subtilisin-like catalytic domain and the
bJR domain.
Additionally, because the PPC domain is not essential for the autoprocessing of the N-
terminal propeptide, as observed in DP and DP’, we do not exclude the possibility that
the PPC domains in some pro-TSS molecules could be processed prior to the N-termi-nal propeptide by an active enzyme that matures earlier. The N-terminal propeptidesof subtilisin-like proteases usually act as an intramolecular chaperone to assist in thefolding of its cognate mature domain (33), although no requirement of the N-terminalpropeptide for correct folding of the enzyme has been reported for some proteasessuch as Tk-SP (34). For TSS, its N-terminal propeptide deletion variant is susceptible to
proteolysis, suggesting that the lack of the N-terminal propeptide affects the folding
of the enzyme. Notably, TSS differs from known subtilisin-like collagenolytic proteasesin the roles of the C-terminal domains in enzyme folding and maturation. For instance,the deletion of the C-terminal PD and PKD domains of MCP-01 does not prevent thefolding of the enzyme into an active form (35). Similar to MCP-01, an AcpII variant thatlacks the two PPC domains at the C-terminus is able to fold into an active form (16). Inthe case of TSS, the
bJR domain but not the PPC domain is necessary for the folding
and maturation of the enzyme. It appears that the C-terminal domains of subtilisin-likecollagenolytic proteases play different roles in enzyme folding and maturation.
Thermostability. With regard to thermostability, TSS is comparable to the collage-
nolytic protease from Thermoactinomyces sp. 21E, which is one of the most thermo-
stable collagenolytic proteases reported so far (25); both of them retain approximately80% of the original activity after incubation at 75°C for 30 min. Although TSS is mostclosely related to KP-43 in terms of the amino acid sequence and domain organization
of the mature form, it is more thermostable than the latter (36). Most of the ligand resi-
dues of the Ca1, Ca2, and Ca3 sites of KP-43 are conserved in TSS, and all of the threeCa
21-binding sites contribute to the thermostability of TSS. One signi ﬁcant difference
between the Ca3 sites of KP-43 and TSS is that Asp367and Asp369in KP-43 are replaced
by Asn368and Asn370in TSS (Fig. 4B). In KP-43, the side chain oxygen atoms (Od1)o f
Asp367and Asp369are ligands for Ca21(37). The substitution of Asn368or Asn370of TSS
with Asp destabilizes the enzyme. Given that the TSS Ca3 site binds Ca21in the same
way as the KP-43 Ca3 site, the side chain oxygen atoms (Od1) of Asn368and Asn370in
TSS could act as Ca21-binding ligands. Although the replacement of Asn368or Asn370of
TSS with Asp does not eliminate the Ca21-binding ligands, the introduction of the

10–80mg/mL of mTSS. At different time intervals, images of FSC were photographically recorded (A), the number of soluble peptides released from FSC
was quanti ﬁed to calculate the percentage of FSC degradation (B), and the soluble fractions of the samples in the absence ( 2) or presence ( 1)o f1 0 mg/
mL of mTSS were subjected to tricine-SDS-PAGE without TCA pre-treatment (C). The values are expressed as means 6SDs from three independent
experiments (B). Note: mTSS showed an AMW of 35 kDa by tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis (C, indicated by an arrowhead), which is higher than that (22 kDa) bySDS-PAGE analysis using Tris-glycine buffer system (Fig. 3A).Zhang et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology

negatively charged carboxyl group of Asp may increase unfavorable electrostatic
repulsion at this site, leading to the destabilization of the enzyme. Interestingly, thethermostability of pyrolysin could be improved by Asn substitutions at Asp
818and
Asp820of the Ca2 site in the PPC domain (corresponding to Asn368and Asn370of the
Ca3 site of TSS), most likely due to the elimination of unfavorable electrostatic repul-sion at this Ca
21-binding site (38). In this context, the elimination of unfavorable elec-
trostatic repulsion by using uncharged Asn instead of Asp as the Ca21-binding residues
appears to be one of the strategies for thermostabilization of TSS.
Solvent-accessible ion pairs have been identi ﬁed as important contributors to pro-
tein thermostability (39, 40), and the proteins from thermophiles have more ion pairs,particularly long-range ion pairs, than those from mesophiles (41). Similarly, more sur-face long-range ion pairs are predicted for TSS than for KP-43, probably representingan important stabilizing factor of TSS at high temperatures. In support of this, we
observed that TSS showed a decrease in thermostability as pH value increases from 9.0
to 11.0. Because basic amino acid residues tend to be deprotonated at high pH values,it is reasonable that the ion-pair interactions for stabilizing TSS would be attenuated,leading to a decrease in thermostability.
Halotolerance. TSS exhibits increased thermostability with the increase of NaCl con-
centration up to 4 M. Such a high halotolerance has not been reported for other thermo-
phile-derived collagenolytic proteases (19, 23, 25). Recently, we found that high-concentra-tion NaCl improves the thermostability of the subtilisin-like protease Als (42). Although TSSand Als share low amino acid sequence identity (17%), both enzymes have an excess ofsolvent-accessible acidic residues. It is well known that solvent-accessible acidic residuescontribute to the formation of a strong hydration shell for maintaining structural stabilityof haloarchaeal enzymes under high salinity conditions (43). Both TSS and Als seem toemploy the same strategy as halophilic enzymes from haloarchaea to resist high salt con-centrations. Nevertheless, TSS and Als are halotolerant rather than halophilic enzymes,
since they are also highly stable in the absence of NaCl. Halophilic enzymes tend to lose
their structural integrities under low salinity conditions due to strong electrostatic repul-sion force exerted by acidic residues (43). Compared with its homologues from haloarch-aea, both TSS and Als (42) possess an increased number of surface ion pairs, which maycompensate for the destabilizing effect of electrostatic repulsion by negatively chargedresidues at low salt concentrations.
With the increase of salt concentration, the azocaseinolytic activity of TSS showed a
trend of initial decrease followed by an increase, which could be interpreted as a com-
bination of multiple processes. First, the increase of salinity would weaken electrostaticinteractions in TSS, and thus may confer certain structural ﬂexibility favorable for the
catalytic hydrolysis of peptide bonds by the enzyme. This is supported by the fact thatthe activity of the enzyme against suc-AAPF- pNA continuously increased with rising sa-
linity. Secondly, the salinity variation may in ﬂuence the interactions between the sub-
strate and the enzyme. Our data suggest that the
bJR domain of TSS has the ability to
bind collagen and also contributes to the azocaseinolytic activity of the enzyme. The
bJR domain is situated far away from the active-site cleft of the catalytic domain (Fig.
S1) and could provide additional binding sites only for a large protein substrate such
as azocasein but not for a small substrate such as suc-AAPF- pNA. The increase of salin-
ity would in ﬂuence electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in TSS and induce struc-
tural adjustment, which may affect the interaction of the enzyme (particularly the bJR
domain) with azocasein for catalysis. Thirdly, the difference in salt-dependent catalyticbehaviors of TSS toward azocasein and suc-AAPF- pNA may be related to salt-induced
substrate conformation change, which is more evident in proteins than in peptides(44). The conformation change in azocasein would have in ﬂuences on its binding to
and catalysis by TSS, depending on salt concentration.
Collagenolytic activity. The hydrolysis of collagen substrates by TSS is highly tem-
perature-dependent, exhibiting high collagenolytic activity at high temperatures (e.g.,60–70°C) but a very low activity against type I collagen or azocoll at 37°C. This re ﬂects
not only the thermophilic nature of TSS but also its preference for heat-denaturedA Thermostable Collagenolytic Protease TSS Applied and Environmental Microbiology

rather than native collagen. It is considered that heat treatment leads to the conver-
sion of collagen to gelatin, thus enzymatic degradation of collagen at high tempera-
tures is mainly due to the gelatinolytic activity of the enzyme (6). However, TSS exhibits
high collagenolytic but low gelatinolytic activity, with a very low gelatin/collagen ratio
compared to ChC, suggesting that the high collagenolytic activity of TSS does not
mainly result from its gelatinolytic activity. Additionally, TSS differs from ChC in their
type I collagen- and b-casein-hydrolyzing patterns, implying that substrate cleavage
speci ﬁcity contributes to their differences in gelatinolytic activity. The collagenase PrtC
from Porphyromonas gingivalis could hydrolyze heat-treated collagen but not gelatin
at temperatures below 37°C; however, the collagenolytic mechanism of this enzyme
remains unclear (20). The preference of TSS for insoluble heat-denatured collagen is
obviously related to its collagen-binding ability, which would increase the local
enzyme concentration around the substrate to facilitate collagen degradation. In con-
trast, soluble collagens are uniformly distributed in the solution and are unlikely to
locally concentrate TSS as aggregated and insoluble collagens, so they are less ef ﬁ-
ciently degraded by the enzyme. This is supported by the evidence that more TSS-
cleaved peptides are released from insoluble collagen than from thermally solubilized
collagen. Meanwhile, the digestion patterns of the insoluble and solubilized collagens
by TSS are similar but not the same, implying that the structural difference between
the two forms of collagen has an effect on their degradation by the enzyme.
Bacterial collagenolytic proteases usually have a preference for certain peptide
bonds of collagen, depending on the substrate state and the enzyme type. For native
collagen, Clostridium and Vibrio collagenases (5), MCP-01 (45), and myroicolsin (17)
have a strong preference for Gly at the P1 ’position and a relatively broad preference
for the amino acids at the P1 position. For denatured collagen, myroicolsin strictly pre-
fers Lys and Arg at the P1 position and strongly prefers Gly at the P1 ’position at 50°C
(17); kumamolisin-As shows a very strong preference for Arg at the P1 position and a
non-strict preference for aromatic or bulky aliphatic amino acids (Phe, Ile, Tyr, and Trp)
at the P1 ’position at 60°C (24). It is evident that, for all reported bacterial collagenolytic
proteases except kumamolisin-As, the mostly preferred amino acid at the P1 ’position
is Gly, which is the most abundant amino acid in collagen. Meanwhile, in denatured
collagen the peptide bonds with P1 basic residues are exposed and sensitive to colla-
genolytic proteases such as myroicolsin (17) and kumamolisin-As (24). In the case of
TSS, it not only preferably acts on Xaa-Gly and Arg-Xaa (particularly Arg-Gly) peptide
bonds of heat-denatured collagen, but also ef ﬁciently hydrolyzes the peptide bonds
with P1 position occupied by Ala, which is also one of the most abundant amino acids
in collagen, thereby endowing the enzyme with high collagenolytic activity at high
temperatures.
The PKD domain of MCP-01 (15) and the PPC domains of several proteases from
psychrotolerant/mesophilic bacteria (46) not only bind but also swell insoluble colla-
gen, thereby facilitating substrate hydrolysis by the enzyme. In contrast, the binding of
thebJR and PPC domains of thermophile-derived TSS to collagen does not result in
collagen swelling, and TSS does not show improved activity on bJR- or PPC-treated
collagen. We postulate that, as TSS prefers to hydrolyze collagen at high temperatures
under which condition the substrate will be thermally denatured, a collagen-swelling
domain seems to be unnecessary. The PPC domain of TSS is present in the proform
and the maturation intermediate but not the mature form; therefore, it does not
directly participate in the collagen binding of the mature form. Nevertheless, we can-
not exclude the possibility that the PPC domain could mediate the binding of the pro-
form and the intermediate to collagen, and thus increase the local enzyme concentra-
tion to facilitate enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate.
Hydrolyzed collagen peptides have been widely applied in food, feed, pharmaceuti-
cal, and cosmetic industries, and the use of FSC-derived peptides are of renewed inter-
ests due to the safety and religious concerns of their mammalian counterparts (2, 47).

degrade FSC into small peptides at high temperatures and thus has the potential to be
used for the preparation of functional peptides from ﬁsh scales.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. Restriction enzymes and Fast PFU DNA polymerase were purchased from ThermoFisher
Scienti ﬁc (Waltham, MA, USA). T4 DNA ligase was from TransGen Biotech (Beijing, China). Azocasein,
casein, gelatin (from porcine skin), suc-AAPF- pNA, type I collagen (from bovine achilles tendon), azocoll
(from bovine skin), and C. histolyticum collagenase were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. Brevibacillus sp. WF146 (CCTCC AB209297) was grown at
55°C in Luria –Bertani (LB) medium and used for extraction of genomic DNA as described previously (29).
E. coli DH5aand E. coli BL21(DE3) were used for cloning and expression, respectively, and were grown at
37°C in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 mg/mL) as needed.
Plasmid construction and mutagenesis. The plasmid pET26b (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) was
used as the vector for expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3). The primer sequences
and the primer pairs used for PCR are listed in Tables S6 and S7, respectively. The gene encoding theproform of TSS (pro-TSS) was ampli ﬁed by PCR from the genomic DNA of strain WF146 and inserted into
theNde I-Xho I site of pET-26b to construct the plasmid pET26b -pro-TSS . The DNA sequences encoding
the C-terminal truncation variants ( DP,DP’, andD
bP), the N-terminal propeptide deletion variant ( DN),
and the N-terminal propeptide (rN), bJR (rbJR), and PPC (rPPC) domains of TSS were ampli ﬁed from
pET26b -pro-TSS by PCR and inserted into the vector pET-26b to construct the expression plasmids for
the target proteins. Using pET26b -pro-TSS or pET26b DN(Table S7) as the template, the expression plas-
mids for the active-site (pro-S257A, pro-S257C, and DN/S257A) and the Ca21-binding-site variants
(E187A, N368D, N370D, D385A, D393A, D396A, and E402A) of pro-TSS were constructed by theQuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) method (48) using the mutagenesis primer pairs listed inTable S7. The GFP gene was ampli ﬁed from the plasmid pAD123 (49) and inserted into pET26b to con-
struct the expression plasmid for GFP. The DNA fragments encoding GFP and the
bJR domain or PPC
domain were subcloned into pET26b using Ready-To-Use Seamless Cloning Kit (Sangon Biotech,Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer ’s protocol, yielding the expression plasmids for the
fusion proteins GFP-
bJR and GFP-PPC. The sequences of all recombinant plasmids were con ﬁrmed using
DNA sequencing.
Expression, activation, puri ﬁcation, and renaturation. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing recombi-
nant plasmids were cultured at 37°C until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached ;0.7.
Production of recombinant proteins were induced by the addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl- b-d-thiogalacto-
pyranoside (IPTG) and continued cultivation at 30°C for 4 h. Cells were harvested, suspended in buffer A(50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM CaCl
2, pH 7.5), and disrupted by sonication on ice. The soluble and insoluble cel-
lular fractions were separated by centrifuging the cell lysate at 13,000 /C2gfor 10 min at 4°C. The soluble
cellular fraction containing pro-TSS or its Ca21-binding-site variant was incubated at 60°C for 15 min to
activate the enzyme, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 /C2gfor 10 min at 4°C. The resulting superna-
tant was then subjected to fractional salting-out with (NH4)2SO4(50–80%), followed by ion-exchange
chromatography on a buffer A-equilibrated DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences,Uppsala, Sweden) column to purify the mature enzyme. The recombinant protein with a fused His-tag(r
bJR, rPPC, GFP, GFP- bJR, or GFP-PPC) in the soluble cellular fraction was puri ﬁed by af ﬁnity chroma-
tography on a Ni21-charged Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) column equili-
brated with buffer A. Puri ﬁed protein samples eluted from the ion exchange and the af ﬁnity chromatog-
raphy columns were dialyzed against buffer B (50 mM Gly-NaOH, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 9.0) overnight at 4°C.
The protein solution was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-15 3K centrifugal ﬁlter (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) as needed. The protein concentrations of the puri ﬁed protein samples were determined using
the Bradford method (50) with BSA as a standard.
The insoluble cellular fraction of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells producing DbP was dissolved in buffer A con-
taining 8 M urea and incubated at 30°C for 1h. After centrifugation at 13,000 /C2gfor 10 min, the super-
natant was subjected to af ﬁnity chromatography as mentioned above, except that 8 M urea was
included in the binding, washing, and elution buffers. The elution fraction containing DbP was dialyzed
against buffer A at 4°C overnight to allow for protein renaturation.
SDS-PAGE, immunoblot analysis, and activity staining. SDS-PAGE was performed using 12% poly-
acrylamide gel using Tris-glycine buffer system. In some cases, Tris-tricine buffer was used for tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis. To prevent self-degradation of the protease during sample preparation and electro-phoresis, protein samples were precipitated with 20% (wt/vol) TCA, washed with acetone before beingsubjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody (1:10,000, Novagen) and the goatanti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:5000, Abbkine, China) were used for immunoblot analysis, asdescribed previously (51). For protease activity staining, the samples without TCA treatment were mixedwith the loading buffer and then subjected to a gelatin overlay assay as described by Blumentals et al.(52), except that the proteolytic reaction was carried out at 60°C for 3 h in buffer B.
Enzymatic activity assays. Unless otherwise indicated, the azocaseinolytic, caseinolytic, or gelatino-
lytic activity of the enzyme was assayed at 60°C for 30 min in 600
mL of reaction mixture containing
300mL of properly diluted enzyme sample and 0.25% (wt/vol) azocasein, 1.0% (wt/vol) casein, or 0.5%
gelatin in buffer B. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 600 mL 40% TCA. After standing at
room temperature ( ;25°C) for 15 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 /C2gfor 10 min to recover
the supernatant. For enzymatic hydrolysate of azocasein, the absorbance of the supernatant was meas-ured at 335 nm ( A
335) in a 1-cm light-path cell. One unit of azocaseinolytic activity was de ﬁned as theA Thermostable Collagenolytic Protease TSS Applied and Environmental Microbiology

amount of enzyme required to increase the A335value by 0.01 unit/min under the conditions described
above. The acid-soluble peptides of the hydrolysate of casein or gelatin were quanti ﬁed by Lowry ’s
method (53). One unit of caseinolytic or gelatinolytic activity was de ﬁned as the amount of enzyme that
produced acid-soluble peptides equivalent to 1 nmol tyrosine per minute.
The proteolytic activity of TSS against suc-AAPF- pNA (0.2 mM) was measured at 60°C in buffer B. The
activity was recorded by monitoring the initial velocity of suc-AAPF- pNA hydrolysis at 410 nm in a ther-
mostated spectrophotometer (SP752; Shanghai Spectrum Instruments Co. Ltd, China). This velocity was
calculated based on an extinction coef ﬁcient for p-nitroaniline ( pNA) of 8,480 M21cm21at 410 nm (54).
One unit of enzyme activity was de ﬁned as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 mmol of pNA/min
under the assay conditions.
The proteolytic activity of TSS against azocoll or type I collagen was measured as follows. The sub-
strates were washed three times using buffer B with shaking at 37°C. Unless otherwise indicated, the ac-tivity assay was carried out at 60°C for 30 min with shaking in 600
mL of reaction mixture containing
3 mg of the substrate and properly diluted enzyme sample in buffer B. To quantify water-soluble pep-
tides released from the substrates, the reaction was terminated by cooling on ice, followed by centrifu-gation of the mixture at 13,000 /C2gfor 10 min at 4°C to recover the supernatant. In some cases, the reac-
tion was terminated by the addition of 600
mL of 40% TCA, and the mixture was maintained at room
temperature for 15 min, followed by centrifugation to recover the supernatant for quanti ﬁcation of acid-
soluble peptides released from the substrates. For the supernatant of the enzymatic hydrolysate of azo-
coll, the absorbance was measured in a 1-cm light-path cell at 540 nm ( A540). One unit of enzyme activity
against azocoll was de ﬁned as the amount of enzyme required to increase the A540value by 0.01 unit/
min under the assay conditions. The soluble peptides released from type I collagen by the enzyme were
quanti ﬁed by Lowry ’s method (53). One unit of collagenolytic activity was de ﬁned as the amount of
enzyme that produced soluble peptides equivalent to 1 nmol tyrosine per minute (16).
The proteolytic activity of ChC against azocasein, casein, gelatin, azocoll, or type I collagen was
measured as described above, except that buffer B was replaced by buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM
CaCl2, pH 7.5).
Determination of the cleavage sites of insoluble and thermally solubilized type I collagen by
TSS. To prepare solubilized collagen, insoluble type I collagen was incubated in buffer B at 60°C for 2 h.
After centrifugation at 13,000 /C2gfor 10 min, the supernatant was recovered and then concentrated
with an Amicon Ultra-15 3K centrifugal ﬁlter. The insoluble and thermally solubilized type I collagens
(1 mg/mL) were hydrolyzed with mTSS (1 mg/mL) in buffer B at 60°C for 1 h with shaking, and the reac-
tion was terminated by cooling on ice, followed by centrifugation of the mixture at 13,000 /C2gfor
10 min at 4°C to recover the supernatant. The cleaved peptides in the supernatant were determined by
nano LC-MS/MS using an Easy-nanoLC system coupled online with the Q Exactive-HF mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scienti ﬁc, San Jose, CA). The peptide sequences were identi ﬁed using Proteome Discoverer 2.5
software (Thermo Scienti ﬁc) with no-enzyme chosen as the enzyme. Dynamic modi ﬁcations included
were oxidation at methionine, phosphorylation at serine and threonine, and hydroxylation at proline
and lysine.
Collagen-binding and collagen-swelling assays. Insoluble type I collagen and azocoll were used
as the substrates for the binding assay according to the method of Itoi et al. (14) with modi ﬁcations.
Brieﬂy, 3 mg type I collagen or azocoll was washed with buffer B three times and then suspended in
100mL buffer B containing 10 mg/mL target protein, followed by incubation at 0°C or 60°C for 1 h.
Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 /C2gfor 5 min at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant
was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein bands were quanti ﬁed by measuring band intensity using
ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). For the collagen-binding assay of GFP- bJR or GFP-PPC, the
protein (15 mM) was mixed with type I collagen (3 mg) in 600 mL buffer B, and the mixture was incu-
bated at 60°C for 1 h with shaking. After centrifugation at 10,000 /C2gfor 5 min at 4°C, the insoluble frac-
tion was recovered, washed with buffer B three times, and then photographically recorded. Collagen-
swelling assay was performed according to the method of Huang et al. (46) with modi ﬁcations. Brie ﬂy,
3 mg of washed type I collagen was suspended in 1 mL buffer B containing 20 mg/mL target protein
and then incubated at 37°C or 60°C for 6 h with shaking, followed by photographic recording.
Preparation and degradation of FSC. Scales of grass carp ( Ctenopharyngodon idellus ) collected
from a local market were washed with tap water, air dried, and cut into pieces ( ;3/C25m m2). Non-col-
lagenous proteins and pigment of ﬁsh scales were removed by alkaline treatment according to the
method of Matmaroh et al. (55) with some modi ﬁcations. Brie ﬂy, the scale pieces were suspended in 0.1
MN a2CO3at the ratio of 1:10 (wt/vol) with continuous stirring for 18 h, with Na2CO3solution changed at
6 h intervals. The scale pieces were then washed with chilled distilled water until the wash water
reached neutral pH. Subsequently, the decalci ﬁcation of the scale pieces was carried out according to
the method of Wang et al. (56) with some modi ﬁcations. Brie ﬂy, the scale pieces were suspended in 0.5
M citric acid at the ratio of 1:10 (wt/vol) with continuous stirring for 1 h, followed by washing with
chilled distilled water until a neutral pH was reached. The decalci ﬁed scale pieces were then dried at
50°C for 24 h, crushed in a mixing blender, and sieved to produce a 40-mesh FSC powder.
The FSC powder (60 mg) was washed three times using buffer B with shaking at 37°C, suspended in
3 mL buffer B containing different concentrations of mTSS as indicated, and then incubated at 60°C withshaking. At different time intervals, the reaction was terminated by cooling on ice, and the supernatant
of the reaction mixture was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 /C2gfor 10 min at 4°C. The absorbance
of the supernatant was measured in a 1-cm light path cell at 280 nm ( A
280). The A280value of the reaction

buffer C, was also determined and used for calculating the amount of degradation products of FSC in
the supernatant of the reaction mixture.
Homology modeling and ion pair prediction. The structure model of TSS was generated using
SWISS-MODEL ( http://swissmodel.expasy.org )( 5 7 ), with KP-43 (PDB code 1WMF )( 3 7 ) as the template. For
ion pair prediction, the distance between two oppositely charged atoms were measured using DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer version 4.1 ( https://spdbv.vital-it.ch
). The distance limits were chosen to be 4.0 Å and
8.0 Å to ﬁnd salt bridges (58 ) and long-range ion pairs (41), respectively.
Data availability. The draft genome sequence of Brevibacillus sp. WF146 has been deposited in
