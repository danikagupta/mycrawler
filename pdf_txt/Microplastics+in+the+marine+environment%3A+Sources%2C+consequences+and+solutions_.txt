As the global production of plastics continues to acce lerate, the ubiquitous presence of microplastics ( μPs) has
emerged as a signi ﬁcant marine problem. To comprehend fully the potential impacts and ecological harm
caused by μPs it is vital that there is an understanding of their potential sources and sinks; the processes
affecting their distribution; and their uptake and ex change in ecosystems. We car ried out a comprehensive
literature review to test the hypothesis that particle density is a key factor in describing the sinking behaviourand vertical distribution of
μPs and to consider the uptake and trophic transfer of μPs. It was found that, whilst
polymer density is a key factor in determining the vertical distribution of μPs in the water column, interactions
with marine organisms better explain the occurrence of buoyant μPs at great depths. Furthermore, these in-
teractions increase μP availability and uptake, leading to trophic transfer and bioaccumulation within the
food chain.
1. Introduction
Plastics are synthetic polymers derived from fossil fuels or, occasion-
ally, biomass. Almost 360 million tonnes of plastics were produced in 2018
[1] and by 2050 production is expected to intensify to 2000 million tonnes
[2]. Whilst plastic recycling has doubled since 2006 [ 1], 10% of plastics
produced enter the oceans and constitute 80 –85% of marine litter [ 3,4].
Estimates suggest that 92% of the 5.25 trillion plastic particles on the
ocean surface are microplastics ( μPs); small, ubiquitous plastic particles
which are less than 5 mm in size [ 3,5]. They pollute the water column,
sediments and biota of coastal waters, the open ocean, and freshwaterenvironments and also wastewater treatment plants worldwide [ 6–8]. The
adverse impacts of
μPs have led to their classi ﬁcation alongside marine
issues including over ﬁshing and bycatch [ 9,10]. The determination of the
ecological harm caused by μPs and their associated chemicals is a key
objective of the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive
(MSFD 2008/56/EC) [ 7]. This requires exploration of potential μP sources
and sinks and the processes affecting their distribution and ecosystem
uptake.2. Sources of microplastics
As an anthropogenic material, marine plastic pollution originates
from either terrestrial sources, which account for 80% of marine debris
[9,11], or marine activities, such as accidental loss or illegal disposal
during ﬁshing or offshore drilling [ 9]. For example, ships discard 6.5
million tons of plastics each year [ 12].Table 1 demonstrates the diversity
inμP properties encountered during sampling, indicating a multitude of
sources [ 6]. Point ﬂuxes of μPs have speci ﬁc and de ﬁned points of
discharge [ 13] including riverine input or stormwater and sewage out-
ﬂows [ 3,14,15]. Alternatively, diffuse pathways occur over an extended
area from an array of sources, such as accidental spillage or degradation
of larger plastic debris [ 3,14,15].
Primary μPs are intentionally manufactured for applications
including resin pellets and exfoliators in personal care products [ 3,11,
14]. Items containing plastics including synthetic clothing and car tyres
also generate primary μPs during use [ 16,17]. The weathering of larger
plastic debris on land and at sea reduces their structural integrity and
leads to the formation of ﬁbrous or fragmented μPs, known as secondary
μPs [14,18,19]. Single-use plastic bags are a signi ﬁcant source of sec-
ondary μPs due to their low resistance to degradation when exposed to
seawater and sunlight [ 20]. Other sources include packaging wastes,

2.1. Degradation of plastics
In the marine environment plastics degrade through physical,
chemical and biological processes [ 11,19,28]. Plastic degradation re-
quires oxygen and sunlight [ 19,29,30] and so photodegradation is the
most ef ﬁcient process [ 11]. Beaches are the most likely locations of
plastic degradation within the marine environment as conditions are
conducive to high rates of photodegradation [ 19]. Floating plastics
degrade at reduced rates in comparison to terrestrial plastics due to
biological interactions that cause a surface ﬁlm to form and shield the
plastic surface from sunlight; and lower temperatures [ 3,19,30,31].
Lower temperatures and absence of UV-radiation in the deep ocean
further reduces the degradation rate [ 11].
3. Distribution processes
3.1. Horizontal distribution processes
Hydrodynamic processes, such as coastal currents, drift and river
outﬂow act to disperse μPs from their sources. Larger, basin scale and
regional currents advect μPs to remote regions, while in-shore currents
carry them to beaches [ 3,14] from where they may return to the open
ocean [ 6]. Additionally, rotational ocean currents transport surface
plastics to convergence zones of oceanic gyres, leading to concentrated
areas of accumulation [ 11,14,32]. It has been estimated from the results
of worldwide sampling that between 7000 to 35000 tons of plastics lie on
the open-ocean surface [ 32]. However, 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastics
entered the oceans in 2010 alone [ 33], suggesting removal from thesurface to yet unexplained sinks [ 8].
3.2. Vertical distribution processes
Numerous hypotheses state that polymer density determines μP dis-
tribution in the water column [ 3,21]. Polymers denser than sea water,
included in Table 2 , will sink whilst less dense polymers, accounting for
approximately 46% of plastics [ 12], are positively buoyant. The majority
ofμPs identi ﬁed at 2200 m depth in the Rockall Trough were denser than
seawater, accentuating this in ﬂuence [ 10]. However, the occurrence of
similar polymers in the water column and sediments [ 22] and of low
density polymers at depths of 10,000 m [ 26] contradicts this hypothesis.
Alternate hypotheses include biofouling, aggregation and zooplankton
uptake [ 10].
3.2.1. Biofouling
Biofouling is the successive accumulation of organisms on submerged
surfaces [ 35], illustrated in Fig. 1 .I ti si n ﬂuenced by the polymer type,
surface area, surface energy and roughness of the μP particle [ 36] and its
rate depends on the productivity of the surrounding seawater and the
position of the μP in the water column [ 37,38]. Biofouling occurs rapidly,
within days or weeks on surface plastics and at slower rates under sub-
merged conditions [ 35,37].
Initially, the μP particle undergoes surface fouling by dissolved
organic molecules, bacterial cells, algae, larvae and spores [ 19,37]. This
creates a bio ﬁlm which acts as a ‘conditioning ﬁlm’[36,37], enabling the
attachment of colonizing invertebrates and microalgae including barna-
cles, tubeworms, hydroids and mussels [ 38]. Biofouling causes the
overall density of μP particles to increase [ 36] and when it exceeds the
density of seawater, the particle will sink [ 19].Table 1 (continued )

3Since seawater density increases with depth, sinking particles are
suspended at depths where their density equals that of the ambient
seawater [ 35]. Differences in μP particle and seawater density lead to an
oscillatory motion characterised by the collision, growth, mortality and
respiration rates of the attached microorganisms [ 35]. The particle will
reach maximum depths at approximately midday when the sum of thegrowth and collision rates exceeds the sum of the mortality and respi-
ration rates [ 35]. Conversely, the particle will move upwards in the water
column when mortality and respiration dominate, which generally oc-
curs during the night. Experimental results suggest that the sinking ve-
locity of initially buoyant particles increases as the incubation period
increases, emphasising the in ﬂuence of biofouling on
μP sinking,
regardless of polymer density [ 36].
3.2.2. Aggregation
Oxygen-rich aggregates consisting of faecal pellets, phytoplankton,
microbes and particulate organic matter (POM) are abundant at up to
5300 aggregates per litre within the ocean [ 39,40]. They form a keycomponent in the transport of inorganic and organic matter from the
surface to deep oceans [ 18,39,40] and in ﬂuence μP sinking behaviour,
bioavailability, mobility and ultimate fate [ 28]. An outline of the μP
aggregation process is depicted in F Fig. 2 .
Aggregation occurs when two or more particles, including μPs, cells,
detritus and mineral particles, collide and attach to one another, forming
an agglomerate [ 28,40]. Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEPs)
formed by coagulation of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPSs),
enhance aggregation when they collide with organic matter and μPs,
provided they are suf ﬁciently sticky [ 41]. Typically, microorganisms
including phytoplankton, algae, microbes and bacteria [ 40–43] produce
EPSs. These organisms adhere to μPs during biofouling, suggesting the
processes are interlinked. Aggregation due to the hydrophobicity of μP
particles in the absence of EPS [ 43] is possible but uncommon in the
natural environment as the abundance of natural colloids is far greater
than μPs [28].
Marine aggregates readily incorporate μPs, with 73% of aggregates
sampled in situ containing μPs [40]. A critical result from sinking tests
was that aggregates ef ﬁciently transport initially buoyant μP particles,
such as polypropylene and polyethylene, to the sea ﬂoor at enhanced
sinking rates and in a shorter time than they would as free particles [ 39].
Therefore, positive buoyancy is overcome more immediately by aggre-
gation than by biofouling [ 39]. The total aggregate density is much
higher than the density of an individual μP particle, causing the sinking
velocity to increase by several hundred meters per day [ 39,41].
4. Ecosystem uptake and exchange processes
μPs are similar in size to plankton and sediments that form the base of
the food chain [ 24,44,45]. Alarmingly, in the Mediterranean Sea the
numbers of μPs and plankton are similar in order, implying lower-trophic
level (LTL) planktivores, which are often indiscriminate feeders and
capture any particles within an appropriate size range, encounter μPs at
similar frequencies to their natural food source [ 20]. Polymer density
also in ﬂuences μP availability [ 11]. Low-density μPs are available to
organisms in the upper water column, including ﬁlter feeders, suspension
feeders [ 11,44] and surface-feeding birds [ 46,47]. In contrast, benthic
suspension and deposit feeders and detritivores consume high-density
μPs that sink in the water column [ 11,44].
Biofouling increases the nutritional value of μP particles, encouraging
grazing and ingestion [ 44,48,49]. The foulants trigger a response from
zooplankton that utilise chemoreceptors to detect their algae prey [ 50],
leading to a higher rate of ingestion of fouled μPs than pristine μPs [48].
As the primary source of carbon and nutrients to deep-sea ecosystems
[41], aggregates are also key vectors for the uptake of μPs [42]. For
example, the uptake of 7 –30μm polystyrene beads by Blue Mussels
increased from 340 particles per mussel as freely suspended beads to 1.6
/C2105particles per mussel following incorporation into marine snow
[39].
μPs are not digested or absorbed following ingestion since there are
no enzymatic pathways available for the breakdown of synthetic poly-
mers [ 19]. Instead, they are egested [ 44] or pass through cell membranes
and accumulate within tissues, such as the hepatopancreas and ovaries in
mussels [ 51]. The consumption of contaminated prey facilitates the
transfer of μPs to higher trophic levels [ 44]. Trophic transfer has been
demonstrated in laboratory experiments between organisms including
Blue Mussels and Shore Crabs [ 51,52]; Whiting Fish and Norway Lobsters
[12] and for LTL mesozooplankton including copepods and macro-
zooplankton such as mysid shrimps [ 53].
4.1. Zooplankton uptake
Zooplankton are a key component of nutrient cycling within marine
ecosystems, transferring carbon from primary-producing phytoplankton
to higher trophic levels through ingestion and defecation [ 54,55]. Some
zooplanktons produce faecal pellets: densely packed waste organicTable 2

4matter enveloped within a membrane [ 56]. Whilst they are an important
element of the vertical ﬂux in the ocean their signi ﬁcance depends on the
presence of certain phytoplankton and zooplankton [ 56].
Zooplanktons encapsulate μPs into faecal pellets within their guts and
subsequently egest them, potentially within hours of initial exposure [ 50,
56]. Faecal pellets sink beyond the surface layer at high rates that vary
between species; faecal pellets produced by Copepods and Giant Larva-
ceans sink at rates of 86 m/day [ 56] and 300 m/day, respectively [ 57],
whilst Salp faecal pellets have exceptionally high sinking rates of up to
2700 m/day [ 55]. The process of μP ingestion and transfer in
zooplankton faecal pellets is depicted in Fig. 3 .
The incorporation of high-density μPs enhances faecal pellet sinking
rates [ 50]. In contrast, low-density polymers reduce faecal pellet density
and sinking rates, leading to longer residence times in surface waters
where they degrade rapidly and undergo recycling due to biotic in-
teractions such as coprochaly or coprorhexy [ 56,58]. Marine suspension
feeders, detritivores and coprophagous organisms consume faecal pellets,
facilitating further repackaging of μPs into faecal pellets and trophictransfer [ 55,56,58]. Whilst faecal pellets are a viable mechanism for the
removal of small μP particles from the surface and play a key role in the
cycling of nutrients, they are con ﬁned to the upper few hundred metres of
the water column [ 18,39], and consequently will not persist to the deep
sea.
5. Conclusions
There is a clear lack of consensus regarding the in ﬂuence of polymer
density on the vertical distribution of μP particles in the water column. In
this review we found that, whilst polymer density plays a key role in the
initial distribution of μPs on entering the marine environment, in ﬂu-
encing whether the pristine μP particles will ﬂoat or sink, the interactions
ofμPs with marine organisms better explains their occurrence at great
depths. Following on from the identi ﬁcation of microplastics as free
particles, whether clean or biofouled, or within marine aggregates it
would be interesting to quantify the proportion of μPs residing in each of
these states and the potential cycling between them. This cycling is

5particularly important in modelling μP exchange at lower trophic levels
since these processes enhance the nutritional value and availability of μPs
to organisms at locations away from the water surface and increase their
uptake.
To determine the ecological impacts of μPs it is essential that their
various sources and sinks are identi ﬁed and the processes driving their
distribution and ecosystem uptake are clearly understood. Due to their
small size, μPs are almost impossible to remove from natural water
streams [ 6]. Therefore, mitigation measures which limit the input of μPs
into the marine environment in the long term, such as reducing plastic
consumption, particularly of single-use plastics; encouraging recycling;
implementing bans on microbeads in cosmetic products and improving
wastewater treatment infrastructure, will be most effective in limiting the
deleterious impacts of μPs in the marine environment.
