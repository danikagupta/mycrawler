Abstract  
The current study included studying the possibility of fungi in removing two 
types of dyes used in textile factories (red and yellow). Three concentrations of 
dyes (500, 100 and 300) ppm were treated with fungi and measured. Removal ef-
ficiency was measured after 72 hours, and the fungus was more efficient in re-
moving the red dye. The removal efficiency was (99.77, 96.02 and 92.19) % for 
the red dye and (94.11, 93.65, and 88.9) % for the yellow dye. Results indicated 
that the degradation rate of the low concentrations was higher than that of high 
concentrations of both dyes. The results recorded decreased pH values for both 
dyes and all concentrations. It decreased from (7.33, 7.27 and 7.27) to (4.83, 4.83 
and 4.87) after 72 hours of red dye treatment and from (7.23, 7.23 and 7.27) to 
(4.83, 4.83 and 4.8) for the yellow dye.  The electrical conductivity also decreased 
for dyes and all concentrations, from (1509, 1466 and 1501.33) microsiemens/cm 
to (968, 975 and 972.33) microsiemens/cm for the red dye. At the same time, it 
decreased from (1472.67, 1481 and 1487) microsiemens/cm to (988.33, 997 and 
999.33) Microsiemens/cm for yellow dye.  Total dissolved solids values also de-
creased for both dyes, and all concentrations decreased from (1011, 982 and 
1005)mg/l to ( 648, 653 and 651) mg/l from the red dye. At the same time, the 
yellow dye decreased from (986, 992 and 996) mg/l to (662, 667 and 669) mg/l.

INTRODUCTION  
Humans have used textile dyes, and the first evidence of using them belongs to 
Pre-Neanderthals about 1080,000 years ago 1. 
Approximately (10 â€“ 15) % of the total pigments used are lost during the textile 
industry, and many dyes and other substances found in the effluents of factories 
cause environmental pollution 28. Pigment removal from industrial wastewater is 
an important step. Industrial wastewater must be treated before discharge 2. 
Direct disposal of textile wastewater to natural waters resulted in many 
environmental problems. This industry needs high quantities of water,  so many 
countries need to treat this water to consume and reduce water requirements 3. Bionatura  http://dx.doi.org/10.21931/RB/CSS/2023.08.04. 15 2 
 
 Disposing of effluents from textile industries has become very interesting, as this 
liquid waste alters the physical properties of water and increases the Chemical 
and biological oxygen demand because they are organic compounds, some of 
which are complex. Some of them contain nitrogen in their composition. 
Additionally, the products of anaerobic decomposition of some pigments are 
carcinogenic or DNA mutagenic 4. 
These dyes are toxic to aquatic biota because of their salts and heavy metals. 
Their toxicity to mammals is low, but their extensive use can produce wastewater 
with salt levels much higher than normal 5,  6. 
In the last years, many Chemical and physical color removal methods have been 
used, but few were accepted 7. Both physical and chemical treatment methods are 
not widely used due to their cost and disposal problems. Hence, there is a need 
for new green techniques to solve the problem, including the adsorption of dyes 
on algae, bacteria, fungi and plants ((or) low -cost non -traditional adsorbents 8,  9. 
Research interest in the biological treatment of fungi has increased in the past 
decades because of the high biomass compared to bacteria to remove color by 
degrading synthetic dyes 10. So, the cell wall of fungi is made of glycoprotein, 
glucan, and chitin, multiple binding sites for the interaction of the bio -sorbents 
with the dye. The fungi was recorded as a suitable microorganism for wastewater 
treatment and removal of dyes 11. The fungal cell has an additional advantage 
over other unicellular microorganisms by dissolving insoluble substances by 
enzyme production outside the cell because of the increased cell ratio to the 
surface  12. Aspergillus niger is a dark -colored fungus; it is a saprophytic fungus 
used to degrade dyes and heavy metals 13. Aspergillus niger is rapidly growing on 
a set variety of substances that produce colonies consisting of yellow or white 
basal hyphae covered with a dense layer of conical heads of dark brown to black 
color, and their fungal hyphae are divided and obvious 14. 
The pH has a significant effect on the ability to remove pigment; the pH value of 
a solution of the dye affects the chemical structure of both the dye molecule and 
the biomass of fungi 15. 16 also recorded that the optimum pH value of Coriolus 
versicolor  growth was at 45. The highest dye removal efficiency (99%) was also 
obtained at pH 4.5 while decreased to (50%) at pH= 6 or 7 17. 
 
METHODS  
Preparation of dye concentrations:  
Three dye concentrations were prepared (50, 150, 300) ppm with their replicates 
and control groups.  
 
Inoculation build -up: 
Aspergillus niger  was taken from the Biology Department at the University of 
Babylon; the fungus was cultured on a PDA medium and incubated at 25 C for 7 
days. Aspergillus niger spores were harvested from the petri dish  after adding 2 
ml of distilled water to the petri dish, then filtered, and the filtrate was taken to 
use as an inoculum 29. 
 
Absorbance Measurement:  
Absorbance was measured by using a spectrophotometer at 487 nm. 
Measurements were taken each 24 hrs.

 Where  D%= removal ratio , i = first absorbance , I = last absorbance . 
Measurement of pH, Ec and TDS:  
Measurements of pH, Ec and TDS were taken by portable electronic multi -
measurement meter (HANNA).  
RESULTS  
The results showed that the rates of red dye removal when measured after (24, 
48, and 72) hours were (62.85, 83 52 and 99.77) % for the concentration 50 ppm, 
while for the concentration 100 ppm were (50.96, 77.87 and 96.02) %, and the 
concentration 300 ppm were (38.87, 60.55 and 92.19)%, as shown in Figure (1 -
1). The yellow dye removal results revealed that for the concentration (62.09, 
80.94 and 94.11) %, while the concentrations of 100 ppm were (48.31, 76.88 and 
93.65)%, and for the concentration of 300 ppm were (38.68, 58.01 and 88.9) % 
when measured after (24, 8, and 72) hours as shown in Figure (1 -2)

The efficiency of the fungus in removing the dyes was higher at the low 
concentrations for both, while the fungus was less efficient in removing high 
concentrations of dyes. Dye adsorption with a range of concentrations determines 
the organism's ability to remove; the higher concentrations of the dye need more 
time for decomposition and remove the color, so it has been recorded that the rate 
of decolorization decreased with increased concentrations of the dye; this is 
related to the inhibition effects of the high concentrations of dye on potency and 
activeness of the fungus 18.  
The results also revealed a decrease in the values of Ph, the electrical 
conductivity and TDS of the solutions of  both dyes and for all concentrations 
after 72 hours of treatment, as shown in Figures (1 -3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7 and 1 -8).

DISCUSSION  
These results agree with the results of 19 and 20, which recorded a significant 
decrease  in BOD, COD, TSS, and TDS values after textile wastewater treatment  
by using  Aspergillus niger. The lower values were due to the decomposition of 
the chemicals in the samples. PH decrease results from the decomposition of dyes 
into simple low molecular weight compounds, such as the formation of Organic 
acids 21. 
22 indicated a decrease in pH after fungal biological treatment in both static 
without shaking samples and with shake -led pH decrease due to the accumulation Bionatura  http://dx.doi.org/10.21931/RB/CSS/2023.08.04. 15 7 
 
 of organic acids, vanillic acid, and formic acid that is formed as a result of fungal 
biomass activity.  
Different pH values have an important role in the decolorization because it 
detects the surface charge of the bio -sorbent and the ionization of the dye 
solution, and it has achieved decolorization by more than 97 % using Aspergillus 
niger at pH = 5  23. Furthermore, 24 recorded that the acid values of pH are 
predominant in general and maintain the good growth of microorganisms to 
remove color optimally. It is possible to control the biomass surface charge and 
dyes ionic forms pH value of the solution 25. The decreased value of total 
dissolved solids of the treated solution may result from ion consumption by 
fungal cells for growth 26,  27. 
 
CONCLUSIONS  
Results indicated that the degradation rate of the low concentrations was higher 
than that of high concentrations of both dyes. The results recorded decreased pH 
values for both dyes and all concentrations.
