Abstract
Aspergillusniger is capable of removing dyes from an aqueous solution. In the study, the roles played by three major functional
groups: carboxyl, amino and phosphate, and the lipid fraction in the biomass of A.nigerin biosorption of four dyes, Basic Blue 9,
Acid Blue 29, Congo Red and Disperse Red 1, were investigated. These functional groups in A.nigerwere chemically modiﬁed
individually to determine their contribution to the biosorption of dyes. It was found that biosorption of dyes was inﬂuenced by thefunctional groups in the fungal biomass and the chemical structure of the dyes. /C2112002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Dye wastewaters discharged from textile and dyestuﬀ
industries have to be treated due to their impacts on
water bodies and particularly growing public concern
over their toxicity and carcinogenicity (Banat et al.,1996). It has been rather diﬃcult to treat dye wastewa-ters by conventional biological and physical–chemicalprocesses because of the complex molecular structure ofthe dyes. Therefore, innovative treatment technologiesare being investigated.
Decolorization of dye wastewater by fungal biomass
(live and dead)is thesubject of many studies reviewed in
a recent paper (Fu and Viraraghavan, 2001a). Onlylimited information is available on interactions betweendead fungal biomass and a variety of dyes with complexmolecular structures.
Thecontributionofvariousfunctionalgroupssuchas
carboxyl, amino, phosphate and sulfonate in biosorp-tion of heavy metals has been examined in various
studies on biosorption sites of heavy metals in fungal
biomass (Akthar et al., 1996; Tobin et al., 1990; Fourestand Volesky, 1996; Kapoor and Viraraghavan, 1997).The roles played by these functional groups in bio-sorption of dyes have not been studied to the best of ourknowledge.Theobjectiveofthisstudywastoinvestigatethe role of carboxyl, amino and phosphate functionalgroups, and lipids present in the fungal biomass, A.ni-
ger, in biosorption of four diﬀerent dyes, Basic Blue 9,

2.1.Dyesolutionpreparation
The dyes used inthis study arelisted in Table 1. Their
chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1. The dyes weresupplied by Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA. Dyesolutions were prepared by dissolving accuratelyweighed dyes in distilled water at a concentration of 50mg/l.The initial pHofeach dye solution was adjusted toits eﬀective pH obtained from the results of batchstudies (Table 2). Details are available in an earlier pa-
per (Fu and Viraraghavan, 2000).

2.3.Chemicalmodiﬁcationofthebiomass
The modiﬁcation to carboxyl functional groups was
made by shaking at room temperature (22 /C61/C176C) 2 g
(dry weight) of the raw biomass in 130 ml of anhydrous
methanol (CH 3OH) and 1.2 ml of concentrated hydro-
chloric acid (HCl) for 6 h at 125 rpm. This treatmentresultedinesteriﬁcationofthecarboxylicacids(Gardea-Torresdey et al., 1990; Drake et al., 1996). The generalreaction scheme is
RCOOH þCH
3OH!Hþ
RCOOCH 3þH2O ð1Þ
This biomass residue obtained was referred to as M1.The modiﬁcation to amino functional groups was
made by shaking at room temperature 1g (dry weight)of the raw biomass in 20 ml of formaldehyde (HCHO)and 40 ml of formic acid (HCOOH) for 6 h at 125 rpm.This treatment resulted in methylation of amine (Lou-don, 1984). The general reaction scheme is
RCH
2NH2!HCHO ;HCOOHRCH2NðCH3Þ2þCO2þH2O
ð2Þ
This biomass residue obtained was referred to as M2.
The modiﬁcation to phosphate functional groups was
madebyheating1g(dryweight)oftherawbiomassunderreﬂux with 40 ml of triethyl phosphite ( ðC
2H5OÞ3P) and
30mlofnitromethane(CH 3NO2)for6h.Thistreatment
was reported to result in esteriﬁcation of the phosphategroupoforthophosphoricacid(Markowskaetal.,1975).This biomass residue obtained was referred to as M3.
The extraction of the lipid fraction was carried out
under two conditions:
1. by heating 1 g (dry weight) of the raw biomass under
reﬂux with 75 ml acetone for 6 h;
2. by heating 1g (dry weight) of the raw biomass under
reﬂux with 75 ml benzene for 6 h (Tobin et al., 1990).
The biomass residues obtained after acetone treatmentwas referred to as M4 and the residue after benzenetreatment was referred to as M5.
2.4.Dyebiosorptionexperiments
Dye biosorption experiments were conducted by
shaking 0.2 g of the raw biomass or chemically modiﬁedbiomass in 75 ml of the dye solution (dye concentration50 mg/l) at the eﬀective initial pH and for a period equaltothe equilibrium timeforthedyeadsorption(see Table2). The mixture was shaken in 125 ml conical ﬂasks
closed with PARAFILM ‘‘M’’ to prevent evaporative
losses on a LAB-LINE
/C226rotary shaker operating at 125
rpm. Before measurement of the dye concentration, themixture of dye solution and fungal biomass was vacuumﬁltered through a 0 :45lm AcetatePlus (supported,
plain) membrane ﬁlter (47 mm diameter), supplied byMSI, Westboro, MA 01581, USA. The ﬁltrate was an-alyzed for dye concentration and the dye adsorbed by
the biomass was calculated by material balance.
Dye concentration was measured at a pH of 7.6 by aspectrophotometer (Baush and Lomb-Spectromic 21).

3. Results and discussion
3.1.BasicBlue9
The results of biosorption of Basic Blue 9 on the raw
andthechemicallymodiﬁedbiomassesareshowninFig.2. None of the chemical treatments increased the bio-
sorption capacity for Basic Blue 9 and reductions
ranging from 15% to 98% were observed.
M2 caused the highest reduction (98%) in biosorp-
tion. M1resulted in a 78% reduction in biosorption.These results indicated that the amino and carboxylgroups played important roles in the biosorption ofBasic Blue 9. M3 reduced biosorption 19%, while M4and M5 decreased biosorption by 15% and 26%, re-
spectively.
The ﬁnal pH values decreased in all cases from an
initial pH of 6.0 to ﬁnal pH values in the range 4.0–5.4,while the ﬁnal pH increased for the raw biomass to 6.6.M2 caused the highest pH reduction (ﬁnal pH ¼4.0).
This could be due to the release of the residual formicacid in the modiﬁed biomass.
Basic Blue 9 is a salt and dissociates in an aqueous
solution to the cation which is the colored part of the
salt, and the anion, Cl
/C0. The dye molecule can be rep-
resented by DyeþCl/C0. The cation, Dyeþ, is associated
with the atoms, nitrogen or sulfur, which are the twoalternate locations in the dye structure. The alternatelocation is shown with asterisk ( /C3) in Fig. 1(Aspland,
1997). Therefore, the biosorption of Basic Blue 9 onfungal biomass is due to the interaction between the
Dye
þand the fungal biomass.
Inthisstudy,theresultsofBasicBlue9biosorptionon
fungal biomass of A.nigerare similar to those observed
by Kapoor and Viraraghavan (1997) on heavy metalbiosorption on the same strain of fungal biomass. ThiscouldsuggestthatthemechanismsinvolvedinBasicBlue9 biosorption were similar to heavy metal biosorption.
In the case of M2, formaldehyde can reversibly re-
place labile H atoms on –COOH and –SH groups of
proteins (Davis et al., 1973). Therefore, the reduction ofbiosorption of Basic Blue 9 on amino modiﬁed biomass(M2) could be attributed to amino and/or carboxyl
groups.
The carboxylate anion in the fungal biomass could be
a proper binding site for attracting Dye
þ. The result of
the study conﬁrmed this and was consistent with the
results of El-Hilw (1999).
In this study, the drastic reduction of Basic Blue 9
biosorption capacity after amino groups modiﬁcationalso indicated that the cation Dye
þcould prefer binding
to the amine groups which could be similar to Cu2þTable 2

tween the cation, Dyeþ, and R –NHþ
3was not electro-
static attraction but other mechanisms may be involvedin Basic Blue 9 biosorption.
Because phosphate groups also exhibit a negative
charge, it is expected that they should be the majorbinding sites for Dye
þ. But the reduction of biosorption
capacity for Basic Blue 9 (19%) was not signiﬁcant afteresteriﬁcation of phosphate groups which indicated that
the phosphate groups were not the major binding sites
for Dye
þof Basic Blue 9 and the mechanisms may not
be electrostatic attraction only. This is not consistentwith the results of Kamel (1993).
Therefore, carboxyl and amino groups could be the
main binding sites on fungal biomass surface for BasicBlue 9 biosorption, while the phosphate groups and li-pidfractionwerelesslikelytobethemajorbindingsites.
The electrostatic attraction may not be the primary
mechanism.
3.2.AcidBlue29
The results of biosorption of Acid Blue 29 on the raw
and the chemically modiﬁed biomasses are shown inFig. 3. All of the chemically modiﬁed biomasses slightlyincreased bisorption of Acid Blue 29 and the enhance-ments ranging from 0.2% to 0.9% were observed.
The ﬁnal pH values all slightly increased from an
initial pH of 4.0 to ﬁnal pH values in the range 4.2–4.5
except with the acetone treatment. The ﬁnal pH de-
creased to 3.7 for the acetone treatment.
Acid Blue 29 has its vital substituents, sodium sulf-
onate groups ( –SO
3Na), attached to the naphthalene
ring which gives it the property of water solubility. In anaqueous solution, it ionizes into two sodium cations andtwo colored sulfonate anions. Acid Blue 29 can bewritten Dye ðacidÞ
2/C0/C12Naþ(Aspland, 1997). Therefore,
the functional groups which are charged positively on
the fungal biomass surface can attract Dye(acid)2/C0and
remove it from an aqueous solution.
Fu and Viraraghavan (2001b) reported that the ef-
fective pretreatment of the biomass in the case of AcidBlue 29 adsorption was H
2SO4plus autoclaving and
suggested that H 2SO4pretreatment changed the nega-
tively charged surface of the biomass to a positively
charged one. It was observed that the biosorption pro-
cess of Acid Blue 29 was rapid. These indicated that themechanism of Acid Blue 29 biosorption could be elec-trostatic attraction.
In this study, all the modiﬁcations of diﬀerent func-
tional groups slightly increased biosorption capacity,which could indicate that modiﬁcations had no eﬀectson Acid Blue 29 biosorption, or other functional groups
could be involved in biosorption. The carboxylic acids
dissociate into carboxylate anions to a small extent atthe eﬀective initial pH of 4.0. These may not be thebinding sites for the Dye ðacidÞ
2/C0. The phosphate groups
also could not be the binding sites for Dye ðacidÞ2/C0due
to their negative charge. On the other hand, in themolecule of Acid Blue 29, there is a primary amine
(–NH
2) attached to the naphthalene ring. The primary
aminewillbepositivelycharged(NHþ
3)inthesolutionat
the initial pH of 4.0, which would be expected to bindwith negatively charged functional groups, such ascarboxyl and phosphate groups. Therefore, the modiﬁ-cations of these groups could reduce the biosorptioncapacity of Acid Blue 29. However, the results did notshowthe reduction,but a slight increase which indicated
that carboxylic acid and phosphate groups were not the
binding sites for Acid Blue 29. This could be due to theposition of amine in the molecule of Acid Blue 29 whichmight cause the weak basicity of primary amine (Lou-don, 1984). The results of acetone and benzene treat-ment indicated that any biomass components extracteddid not contribute to the biosorption of Acid Blue 29 onfungal biomass.
The amino groups in the fungal biomass will be
protonated at the eﬀective initial pH of 4.0. Meanwhile,in the process of H
2SO4pretreatment, the amino groupsFig. 3. Amount of dye biosorbed by H 2SO4pretreated biomass

tacting with dye solution containing 45.96 mg/l of Acid Blue 29.142 Y.Fu,T.Viraraghavan/BioresourceTechnology82(2002)139–145in the fungal biomass are also protonated. Therefore,
the amino groups could be the major binding sites for
Acid Blue 29. In the fomadehyde–formic acid (HCHO–HCOOH) treatment for methylation of amino groups,the primary amine (R–NH2) is methylated to tertiaryamine (R –NðCH
3Þ2). The tertiary amine can be com-
pletely protonated in dilute mineral acids as follows(Loudon, 1984)
R–NðCH
3Þ2þHþ()R–NðCH3Þ2Hþð3Þ
Therefore, the tertiary amine groups would still be
available as binding sites for Acid Blue 29 and couldresult in the slight change in biosorption capacity. This
indicatedthataminogroupscouldbethebindingsitesin
biosorption of Acid Blue 29.
3.3.CongoRed
The results of biosorption of Congo Red on the raw
and the chemically modiﬁed biomasses are shown in
Fig. 4. None of the chemical treatments increased thebiosorption capacity and reductions ranging from 19%
to 56% were observed. The lipid extraction with benzene
(M5) signiﬁcantly inhibited biosorption of Congo Redand caused the highest reduction (56%) in biosorption.The carboxyl groups esteriﬁcation (M1) also markedlyinhibited the biosorption of Congo Red and the reduc-tion of biosorption was 50% next to the lipid extractionby benzene (M5). The phosphate groups esteriﬁcation(M3) resulted in similar reduction of biosorption (50%)
as the carboxyl groups modiﬁcation (M1). Lipid ex-
tractionwithacetone(M4)decreasedbiosorptionto45%lessthanthatwithbenzene(M5),whiletheaminogroupsmethylation (M2) reduced biosorption the least (19%).
The ﬁnal pH values all increased. The ﬁnal pH value
increased to the highest extent from an initial pH of 6.0to a ﬁnalpH of 7.1forthe carboxylgroups esteriﬁcation(M1), while other modiﬁcations all enhanced pH to a
range 6.6–6.7.
Congo Red is a direct dye and classiﬁed as an anionic
dye. The important substituents are the two sodiumsulfonate groups, –SO
3Na, each of which attaches to
one of the two naphthalene rings and makes Congo Redwater soluble. In an aqueous solution, Congo Red ion-izes into two sodium cations and two colored sulfonateanions. Congo Red can be written as Dye ðdirectÞ
2/C0/C1
2Naþ(Aspland, 1997).
In this study, the results were totally diﬀerent from
that of Acid Blue29even though they are both classiﬁedas anionic dyes and have two sodium sulfonate groups.The amino groups modiﬁcation resulted in the least re-duction (19%) in biosorption of Congo Red. The reasonwould be similar to that of Acid Blue 29. After methy-lation, the tertiary amine groups ( –NðCH
3Þ2) are still
positively charged at the initial pH of 6.0 for Congo
Red. 81% of the biosorption capacity was retained afteramino groups modiﬁcation; this indicated that theamino groups could be the major ones contributing toCongo Red biosorption. It was observed that CongoRedbiosorptioncapacitieswereallreducedby50%afterthe modiﬁcations of carboxyl and phosphate groups,which indicated that these two functional groups could
participate in the biosorption of Congo Red. Compared
with the molecular structure of Acid Blue 29, the mol-ecule of Congo Red has two primary amines ( –NH
2)
attached to the two naphthalene rings located at the twoends of the molecule, respectively. The two primaryamines can be protonated ( –NH
þ
3) at the initial pH of
6.0 and could have stronger basicity, which could resultin the attraction between the protonated amine ( –NH
þ
3)
and the negatively charged functional groups, such as
carboxylic acid and phosphate groups.
The treatment by acetone and benzene also decreased
the Congo Red biosorption by 45–56% which indicatedthat lipid fraction could also participate in the bio-sorption of Congo Red and the mechanism could bediﬀerent from electrostatic attraction. The lipid fraction

(control) and chemically modiﬁed biomasses of A.nigerafter con-
tacting with dye solution containing 48.69 mg/l of Congo Red.Y.Fu,T.Viraraghavan/BioresourceTechnology82(2002)139–145 143extracted by benzene seemed to aﬀect biosorption of
Congo Red more (56%) than that extracted by acetone
(45%).
Therefore, in the biosorption of Congo Red, the
amino group could be the major binding site, whilecarboxylic acid and phosphate groups as well as lipidfraction could also be important binding sites. Electro-static attraction was the primary mechanism, whileother mechanisms could also be involved in the bio-
sorption of Congo Red.
3.4.DisperseRed1
The results of biosorption of Disperse Red 1on the
raw andthe chemically modiﬁed biomasses areshown in
Fig. 5. The results were quite diﬀerent from those of the
other three dyes. Two kinds of chemical modiﬁcationssigniﬁcantly increased bisorption, while the other threedecreased biosorption. The esteriﬁcation of phosphategroups (M3) enhanced biosorption to the highest extent(109%), while the lipid extraction by benzene (M5) sig-niﬁcantly increased biosorption (52%). The methylationof amino groups (M2) most severely inhibited biosorp-
tion (91%), while lipid extraction with acetone (M4) and
esteriﬁcation of carboxyl groups (M1) reduced bio-sorption by 55% and 28%, respectively.
The ﬁnal pH increased in all cases. The ﬁnal pH
after biosorption on the raw biomass increased to thehighest extent from an initial pH of 4.0 to a ﬁnal pH of5.8; while the modiﬁcations increased the pH to 4.2–4.6.
Disperse Red 1is a nonionic dye. Due to nonionic
solubilizing groups, it has a very low solubility in waterat room temperature (Aspland, 1997). The left side ofthe molecule of Disperse Red 1contains a nitro ( –NO
2)
group in which nitrogen is positively charged (Loudon,1984) tending to attract electrons. The right side con-tains tertiary amine –NðC
2H5ÞðC2H4OHÞtending to
donate electrons (Aspland, 1997).
In the previous studies conducted by the authors, the
eﬀective pretreatment for biosorption of Disperse Red 1was NaOH plus autoclaving and the fungal biomasspretreated by NaOH was negatively charged. The ef-fective initial pH was 4.0.
In this study, the modiﬁcation of phosphate groups
increased(110%)biosorptionofDisperseRed1showingthat esteriﬁcation of phosphate groups might form new
binding sites for Disperse Red 1. So phosphate groups
could be the potential binding sites. The removal of thelipid fraction through extraction by benzene also in-creased (52%) biosorption of Disperse Red 1thatshowed that this lipid fraction inhibited the biosorptionof Disperse Red 1on unmodiﬁed fungal biomass (rawbiomass). The modiﬁcation of amino groups drasticallyreduced (91%) the biosorption capacity of Disperse
Red 1that indicated that these groups could be major
binding sites for Disperse Red 1. Before and aftermodiﬁcation, amino groups are all protonated amine inthe eﬀective initial pH of 4.0 (Loudon, 1984). In themolecule of Disperse Red 1, the tertiary amine was alsoin the protonated state in the initial pH of 4.0. There-fore, the amino groups in fungal biomass could not at-tach to the positions of –NO
2and –NðC2H5ÞðC2H4OHÞ
in the dye molecule of Disperse Red 1and should be
otherpositions,whichindicatedthatthemechanismsforthe biosorption of Disperse Red 1might not be thephysical adsorption only and may involve chemical ad-sorption. The modiﬁcation of carboxyl acid groups re-duced biosorption capacity of Disperse Red 1to arelative low extent (28%). This could be because the–NO
2and –NðC2H5ÞðC2H4OHÞin the molecules are all
positively charged. So the carboxylate anions in the
fungal biomass can attract these groups in the dyemolecules. So the carboxyl groups could be the bindingsites but not the main sites. Lipid fraction extracted byacetone also signiﬁcantly reduced (55%) biosorption ofDisperse Red 1which indicated that this lipid fractioncould be also the binding sites.

amino groups and lipid fraction extracted by acetone
could be the major binding sites; carboxylic acid groupscould be the binding sites, but not the major one. Thephosphate groups could be the potential binding siteswhichwereeﬀectiveafteresterﬁcation.Thelipidfractionextracted by benzene inhibited the biosorption signiﬁ-cantly. The mechanism of Disperse Red 1biosorptioncould include both physical and chemical adsorption.
4. Conclusions
The mechanisms of the biosorption of the dyes are
dependent upon the chemical structure of the dyes andthe functional groups in the dye molecules. The dif-ferent functional groups in the fungal biomass of A.
nigerplay diﬀerent roles in biosorption of diﬀerent
dyes.
In biosorption of Basic Blue 9 on fungal biomass, A.
niger, the mechanisms are similar to the heavy metal
biosorption. The carboxyl and amino groups are the
main binding sites, while the phosphate group and thelipid fraction are not the major binding sites.
InbiosorptionofAcidBlue29onthefungalbiomass,
electrostatic attraction could be the primary mechanism.The amino groups could be the major biosorption siteswhile the carboxylic acid, phosphate groups and the li-pid fraction may not form the binding sites.
In biosorption of Congo Red on the fungal bio-
mass, the mechanism is diﬀerent from that of AcidBlue 29. The amino, carboxylic acid, phosphate groupsand the lipid fraction could all be important bindingsites. In addition to the electrostatic attraction, othermechanisms may be involved in biosorption of CongoRed.
In biosorption of Disperse Red 1on fungal biomass,
the mechanism is diﬀerent from the other three ionic
dyes. The electrostatic attraction could be only part ofthe whole mechanism. Physical and chemical adsorptioncould occur at the same time. The amino groups and thelipid fraction extracted by acetone are the major bindingsites, while the carboxylic acid groups could be minorbinding sites. The phosphate groups could be potentialbinding sites.Acknowledgements
