Abstract
Introduction  Refractory status epil epticus (RSE) secondary to
traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be under-recognized and isassociated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Methods  This case report describes a 20 year old previously
healthy woman who suffered a severe TBI as a result of a motorvehicle collision and subsequently developed RSE.Pharmacological coma, physiological support and continuouselectroencephalography (cEEG) were undertaken.Results  Following 25 days of pharmacological coma,
electrographic and clinical seizures subsided and the patienthas made an excellent cognitive recovery.Conclusion  With early identification, aggressive physiological
support, appropriate monitoring, including cEEG, and anadequate length of treatment, young trauma patients with noprevious seizure history and limited structural damage to thebrain can have excellent neurological recovery from prolongedRSE.
Introduction
We describe a case of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) sec-
ondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI) requiring 25 days of phar-macological coma with subsequent excellent neurologicalrecovery. A review of the relevant literature on RSE, including
diagnostic and treatment issues as well as the difficult ethical
questions surrounding appropriat e length of treatment in this
condition, is undertaken.
Materials and methods
Case report
A previously healthy right-han ded 20 year old woman sus-
tained multiple injuries following a rollover motor vehicle colli-sion. Her initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, butdeteriorated to 3 on scene. Her vehicle was found overturned.She was belted into the driver's seat with the shoulder beltcompressing her neck. Her face was cyanotic. She was intu-
bated on scene and transferred to hospital.
In the emergency department, her temperature was 35.7°C,
blood pressure 112/66,  heart rate 108 and oxygen saturation
on 50% FiO
2 was 98%. Pupils were 3 mm equal and reactive.
Minimal withdrawal to pain in the lower extremities was noted.
Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric with equivocal plantarresponses.
Initial laboratory investigations were normal. Injuries identified
included a burst fracture of the 6
th and 7th cervical vertebral
bodies with canal narrowing of 50%, subluxation of the right3
rd cervical facet joint, and a righ t occipital condyle fracture. A
computed tomography (CT) scan  of the head demonstrated a
hypodensity in the left cerebellum. CT angiography revealed a
cEEG = continuous electroencephalography; CT = computed tomograp hy; GCS = Glasgow Coma Scale; MR I = magnetic resonance imaging;  RSE 
= refractory status epilepticus; SE = status  epilepticus; TBI = traumatic brain injury.Critical Care     Vol 9 No 6    Peets et al.
R726dissection at C3 and complete occlusion at C7 of the right
vertebral artery.
Six hours after admission, the patient had a witnessed gener-
alized tonic-clonic seizure that responded to 2 mg of IV
lorazepam. A 20 mg/kg IV load ing dose of phenytoin was then
given followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg IV q8h. Two
hours later, she was taken for decompression and fixation of
C6 to T1. Twelve hours post-operatively, generalized tonic-
clonic seizure activity was agai n noted, but resolved after 6 mg
of IV lorazepam. One hour later, further generalized seizure
activity did not respond to 8 mg  of IV lorazepam, so three 100
mg boluses of intrav enous propofol followe d by an infusion at
50 µg/kg/minute was undertaken with clinical resolution of the
seizures.
A repeat CT head confirmed an evolving left cerebellar infarct,
but was otherwise unchanged. Continuous electroencepha-
lography (cEEG) was initiated, which demonstrated ongoing
and repeated right frontal elec trographic seizures with sec-
ondary generalization. These were transiently suppressed with
further bolus doses of 100 mg of propofol, but would recur
despite increasing the infusion of propofol to 80 µg/kg/minute.
Therefore, a loading dose of  700 mg of pentobarbital was
given followed by an infusion at  1 to 5 mg/kg/hour to achieve
burst suppression on cEEG with an  interburst interval of 10 to
15 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed
the CT findings and also demonstrated a small area of contu-
sion subcortically in the right frontal lobe.
Further history obtained from family and friends revealed no
personal or family history of seizures, strokes or hypercoagua-
ble states, no recent illness, no medications and no illicit drug
use.
Every two to three days, the pentobarbital infusion was
weaned, but as the patient em erged from burst suppression,
electrographic seizures would recur on cEEG. In stepwisefashion, valproic acid, oral phenobarbital and levetiracetam
were added, with doses reaching 500 mg tid, 90 mg tid and
2,000 mg bid, respectively, by the tenth day of her admission
(Figure 1). All anticonvulsants were maintained at therapeutic
serum levels.
The patient experienced multiple complications felt in part to
be related to the barbiturate coma, including ventilator-associ-
ated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis and ileus with microp-
erforation and pelvic abscess formation requiring laparotomy.
Therefore, after 13 days of ongoing RSE, the pentobarbital
was changed to propofol 80 µg/kg/minute and midazolam 15
mg/hour continuous infusions. The infusion rates were titrated
to achieve burst suppression on cEEG and were interrupted
every two days to assess for ongo ing seizures. Trials of a con-
tinuous ketamine infusion up to 5 mg/kg/hour and inhalational
isoflurane with a minimum alveolar concentration of 1.0% did
not result in ameliorating t he RSE when burst suppression
was interrupted.
On day 25 of her admission, while on propofol, midazolam,
phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam, the interruption in
the burst suppression showed no ongoing electrographic sei-
zures. Over the next three days, the midazolam and propofol
were discontinued while maintaining cEEG to ensure no sei-
zure recurrence. On day 33 phenobarbital and valproic acid
were discontinued, leaving only  phenytoin 300 mg bid and lev-
etiracetam 1,000 mg bid.
She was discharged from the intensive care unit on day 50.
The patient has had one seizure since then, which was asso-
ciated with a sub-therapeutic phenytoin level. Neuropsycho-
logical testing three months after the initial accident
demonstrated mild difficulty with short-term memory, but was
otherwise normal. She continues to undergo rehabilitation for
her spinal cord injury and cerebellar stroke.Figure 1

R727Results and discussion
While excellent neurological recovery has been described for
prolonged RSE [1-4], to our knowledge this is the firstreported case describing such an outcome in a patient after
nearly four weeks of seizure acti vity with severe TBI as the
acute precipitant.
Status epilepticus (SE) has been variably defined as a contin-
uous, generalized seizure lasting greater than 5 or 30 minutes,or two or more seizures during which the patient does not
return to baseline level of consciousness, again within 5 or 30
minutes [5,6]. When SE does not respond to two first-line
agents or to a first and second  line agent it is termed RSE
[6,7]. The estimated age-adjusted incidence of SE in Europeand the USA is approximately 20/100,000 per year, with ahigher incidence in the elde rly and early childhood [8].
Depending on the underlying etiology, RSE develops in 9% to
40% of patients with SE [9-13].
Following severe TBI, the incidence of seizures has been esti-
mated to be 10% [14], with 1.9% to 8% of these patientsdeveloping SE [5,15-19]. The true incidence of seizures maybe closer to 20%, however, as studies using cEEG have dem-
onstrated that more than 50% of seizures in this population go
undetected due to a lack of witnessed motor activity [15]. Nostudies have reported the incidence of RSE in patients withacute TBI.
SE and RSE are medical emergencies. Mortality rates range
from 2% to 100% [9,15,16,19-22], with factors such as older
age of the patient, acute etiology for the seizure and durationof seizure associated with i ncreased mortality [16-18,20,23].
In the setting of acute TBI, SE portends a particularly poorprognosis, with at least one repo rt of a mortality rate of 100%
[15]. Both SE and RSE are associ ated with significant morbid-
ity as evidenced by increased hospital stays [20] and
increased likelihood of developing symptomatic epilepsy [6].
As seizure duration is one of t he only potentially modifiable fac-
tors for improving patient outc ome, rapid identification and
treatment is crucial. The Veterans Affairs cooperative trial [24]and the San Francisco Emergency Medical Services study
[25] both found IV lorazepam provided the best termination
rates for SE. Phenytoin remains the second-line agent ofchoice, especially if given early [13]; however, there is limitedevidence to guide the systematic addition of anticonvulsants inRSE. Claassen et al. [7] performed a systematic review of 28
studies involving 193 patients with RSE treated with continu-
ous infusions of midazolam, propofol or pentobarbital. While
they determined pentobarbital resulted in fewer breakthroughseizures and treatment failures than the other two agents, the
authors also state that due to significant limitations with the
original data, their results were not intended to provide firmtreatment recommendations, but to guide planning a prospec-
tive trial.Until this prospective randomized trial is undertaken, expert
opinion and case series suggest that continuous infusions ofintravenous propofol or midazolam can also be considered asagents of choice in RSE because of better side effect profiles
and easier titration [26,27]. For cases of prolonged RSE that
are refractory to propofol, mi dazolam and/or pentobarbital,
inhalational anesthetics, intravenous ketamine and newer anti-convulsant agents including topiramate may be considered[27]. In cases where a localized area is causing the seizure,surgery has been used as a last resort [28].
As already described, over 50% of seizures in patients with
TBI may go unrecognized without cEEG monitoring [15]. Evenafter convulsive SE was felt to have resolved following appro-priate medical therapy, DeLorenzo et al. [29] demonstrated
that 14% of patients continued  to have nonconvulsive status
epilepticus detectable only by cEEG. Given the increased
morbidity and mortality associated with prolonged seizure
activity, the difficulty diagnosing nonconvulsive status epilepti-cus clinically and the frequency with which these occult sei-zures have been found to occur , cEEG monitoring in patients
with severe TBI and persistent or unexplained coma should beconsidered a standard of care [30].
With the current technology in multidisciplinary intensive care
units, the ability to support patients for indefinite periods oftime exists. This then raises the ethical issue of defining theduration of therapy beyond which the treatment of RSE is con-sidered futile. Bramstedt and colleagues [31] have recently
recommended that in the absence of an Advance Directive/
Living Will, if pharmacological co ma is only sustaining life and
not reversing the clinical course of RSE, it is most appropriateto provide comfort measures only. In our patient, there wereseveral factors that predicted a very poor outcome: acute TBI,no previous history of seizures , coexistent stroke [32], poten-
tial hypoxic brain injury, low initial GCS and the significant
duration of the RSE. Given her young age and the relatively
normal cranial MRI, however, an aggressive treatment strategywith pharmacological coma was undertaken.
Determining when supportive care becomes futile is extraordi-
narily difficult. Despite advance s in technology, providing an
accurate assessment of long-term outcome at the time of a
severe TBI remains problematic. Several features, includinglower initial GCS, older patient age, bilaterally absent pupillarylight reflex, hypotension and cert ain findings on CT scan, have
been shown to predict poor outcome [33]. As was demon-strated in our case, however, given the vast number of varia-
bles that play a role in determining the final outcome from TBI,
except in the most obvious of cases, young patients need anddeserve a significant period of time in order to demonstrate
their potential for recovery.Critical Care     Vol 9 No 6    Peets et al.
R728Conclusion
Our case demonstrates that with  early identification, aggres-
sive physiological support, ap propriate monitoring, including
cEEG, and an adequate length of treatment, young trauma
patients with no previous seiz ure history and limited structural
damage to the brain can have excellent neurological recoveryfrom prolonged RSE.

 SE should be considered as a possible diagnosis in 
patients with TBI and an unexplained decreased level of consciousness.
 Given the imprecision of ea rly prognostication in TBI, 
young patients with limited structural damage to the brain need and deserve a sign ificant period of time in 
order to demonstrate their potential for recovery.
 Excellent neurological recovery from prolonged RSE is 
possible in this patient population.
