Introduction
Textile industries are known as one of the most 
important sources of synthetic dyes, which are classified 
into different groups: acid, reactive, direct, basic, vat, disperse, metal complex, mordant, and sulphur dyes [1-2]. Azo dyes are regarded as the greatest groups of synthetic dyes, which have one or more azo bounds (-N=N-), and due to their high solubility, low cost, stability, and color variety are widely used in many applications [1, 3]. Reactive red 2 (RR2) is a reactive azo dye because  
its strong covalent bond is hard to disintegrate in nature [4].The discharge of textile effluent into the environment, 
especially receiving waters because of especial characteristics of colored effluents such as complex composition, toxicity, poor degradability, and high solubility, can cause deterioration of environmental quality such as reducing the receiving waters’ self-purification capacity and decreasing the rate of photosynthesis. Therefore, in the last few years removing azo dyes has attracted great interest [5-7]. In this regard, numerous physicochemical methods – including precipitation, coagulation, flocculation, adsorption [2], reduction, electrochemical treatment [8], and photo degradation [9, 10] – have been used to remove dyes from aqueous solutions [7, 11].
Among different methods that have been applied 
for removing dyes, AOPs are known as the proper Pol. J. Environ. Stud. Vol. 26, No. 2 (2017), 765-772

Abstract
This study evaluated the influence of experimental factors on reactive red 2 oxidation by the Fenton 
process using response surface methodology (RSM). Experiments were conducted based on a central 
composite design (CCD) using operating variables such as H2O2, Fe+2, and reaction time. The responses 
were evaluated using a second-order polynomial multiple regression model. The analysis of variance (ANOV A) showed a high coefficient of determination (R
2) value of more than 0.98. It confirms a satisfactory 
adjustment of the second-order regression model with the achieved data. H2O2 had a significant effect on 
the removal of RR2 and COD. When the initial concentration of H2O2 was 90 mg/l, the efficiency of RR2 
removal was 94%. The experimental findings were in close agreement with the model prediction.

techniques to remove toxic aqueous pollutants. They 
are based on producing highly potent oxidants such as hydroxyl radical (OH
°), which has a strong potential 
to remove  pollutants [6]. In recent years, the Fenton process because of high oxidation power, easy operation and maintenance, rapid oxidation kinetics, and relatively low cost and effectiveness has been successfully used as a reagent for removing pollutants from different media [12-13]. Fenton’s reagent (FR) has been applied to treat inorganic and organic components such as phenol, LAS, atrazine, trihalomethanes, and textile sewage [1, 13-17]. According to the different studies that have applied the Fenton process, this reagent is affected by concentrations of oxidant (H
2O2), catalyst (Fe+2), and contaminant. 
Furthermore, other parameters such as contact time, pH, and temperature are important factors that affect the efficiency of process [12, 14]. Therefore, optimizing them has a significant effect on the selecting process by operators of sewage treatment sectors. 
The present work was undertaken to develop 
experimental tests employing the Fenton oxidation process in treating RR2 from synthetic solution. In this regard, it developed a model that provides optimum concentration of catalyst (FeSO
4), oxidant (H2O2), and oxidation time 
by using central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) as mathematical and statistical techniques that are useful for analyzing the effects of several independent variables in the response [18-19].
Materials and Method
Chemical and Feeding 
Lab-grade RR2  with formula (C19H10Cl2N6O7S2.2 Na; 
98%; Fig. 1), Ferrous Soulphat (FeSO4.7H2O; 99.5%), 
and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 35% W/W) were supplied 
by E. Merck, Germany. A 50% H2SO4 solution was used 
to prepare its one molar solution, which is used to adjust pH at 3. A 50% NaOH stock solution was used to prepare its one molar solution, which is used to stop the Fenton reaction at the wanted reaction times. Experimental Method
Batch reactors were employed in this work using six 
series of Pyrex glass with working volume 1 L, each flax was applied for specific concentration of Fenton reagent at different reaction times throughout a cycle with sequencing stages of react, settle, and decant. Settle, decant, and fill stages were always accomplished within 1 hour. The flaxes were filled to capacity of 1 L by stock RR2 solution with initial concentration of 10 mg/L. Then pH was adjusted at 3 with a lab pH meter (model E537). Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide was used as a variable at the arranged concentrations of 10, 50, and 90 mg/L. The concentrations of Fe
+2 as catalysts 10, 50, and 90 mg/L 
were tested in this study.
Sample Preparation 
and Analytical Methods
In the case of designed experiments, sampling was 
carried out after the aforementioned reaction time. Using 0.45 μm filter papers, the collected supernatants were filtered and analyzed every day for RR2 by a Jenway 6305spectrophotometer at λmax 645 nm. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined according to standard methods [20], and pH was adjusted with a Meter Lab E537 pH meter. All the tests were carried out in triplicate to fulfill reproducibility.
 
Experimental Design 
and Data Analysis 
Design-Expert software (version 8.0.0) was applied 
for the statistical design of the experiments and data analysis through the CCD technique and response surface methodology. RSM is a statistical technique that can be used to optimize and model of achieved experimental data through three steps: statistical design of experiments, assessing the coefficients in a mathematical model and predicting the responses, and examining the adequacy of the model [21]. A standard RSM design called central composite design is a suitable method to fit a quadratic surface. The application of this method allows us to estimate the synergetic or antagonist effect of factors with a minimum number of experiments, as well as to analyze the interaction between them [22]. The aforementioned ability of RSM using the CCD was quite enough to use this method to design the experimental works, to optimize the obtained data, and to study the interactive effects of main factors. The number of runs calculated is based on CCD according to the relation 2n + 2n + nc (where n is the number of factors and nc is the number of center points). The center points are developed to evaluate the experimental error and the reproducibility of the data [23]. The experimental data was analyzed and modeled through an empirical second-degree polynomial as Equation 1 [24].

…where i represents the linear coefficient, j stands for 
the quadratic coefficients, β is the regression coefficient, x represents independent variables, k is the number of studied and optimized factors in the experiment, and e is the random error. 
The modeling process was fulfilled by analysis of 
variance (ANOV A) for concentrations of H
2O2 and Fe+2 
and reaction time as independent factors with two main responses: dye removal and COD removal. According to Table 1, the CCD includes eight factorial points, six axial points, and center point with six additional experimental trials as the replicates of this point. The term of coded value was used to present independent variables at three levels: -1 (minimum), 0 (central), and +1 (maximum). The accuracy of the polynomial model was explicated by the coefficient of determination R
2. In addition, model terms 
were selected or rejected based on the P value with 95% confidence levels. Surface plot (three-dimensional) and respective contour plots (two-dimensional) were provided for removing RR2 and COD based on the effects of H
2O2 
and Fe+2 doses in the actual values (A V) at different 
reaction times.Results and Discussion
Development of Mathematical Model
The results of modeling using RSM and CCD based 
on achieved data are summarized in Table 2. RR2 and COD are dye removal and COD removal in terms of coded factors (CF), and actual factors (AF) for H
2O2 , Fe+2, 
and reaction time. The amount of the coefficients for A, B, and C in models confirms the more effective role of H
2O2 concentration and the inferior effect of Fe+2 dosage 
in removing the dye and COD. According to the results of statistical analysis that have been denoted in Table 2, “model F-value” for percentage removal of dye and COD were 923 and 64, respectively. The value of “Prob- F” was 0.0001 for achieved data. The Prob – F > 0.05 indicates that model terms are significant [21, 24]; therefore, the model is significant and there is only a 0.01% chance that a “model F-value” this large could occur due to noise. In this case A, C, A
2, and B2 are significant model terms. 
Values greater than 0.1 indicate that the model terms are not significant. Adequate precision measures the ratio of signal to noise, and a ratio greater than 4 is desirable [24-25]. According to Table 2, a ratio of 24.65 indicates an adequate signal. This model can be used to navigate the design space. The “Pred. R-Squared” of 0.98 is in reasonable agreement with the “Adj. R-Squared” of 0.99.

Effect of H2O2 Concentration
In order to investigate the effect of H2O2 concentration 
on RR2 degradation, experiments were conducted at 
different H2O2 concentrations from 10 to 90mg/L in lab 
conditions while keeping the dye concentration at 10 mg/L and pH at 3. In the Fenton process, H
2O2 concentration 
plays a critical role in contaminant removal efficiency. The results of color removal for 10 mg/L of RR2 for determining optimum H
2O2 concentration are illustrated 
in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, by increasing H2O2 
concentration from 10 mg/L to 90 mg/L, the removal efficiency of RR2 increased from 46% to 98%, when the catalyst and reaction time were 50 mg/L and 10 min, respectively. According to the results, COD removal was 95.8% at 80 mg/L of H
2O2 as shown in Fig. 1. This result 
indicates the minimum yielding 34% COD removals at 10 mg/L of H
2O2 according to aforementioned results in 
Table 1. By increasing the concentration of H2O2 up to 90 
mg/L we did not show significant improvement in COD removal, and by increasing it to 100 mg/L the efficiency decreased to 90%, which can be due to self-decomposition of H
2O2 according to Equation (2). 
Several researchers have studied the effect of initial 
concentration of H2O2 on the degradation of organic 
compounds using the Fenton process. They confirmed that choosing the suitable concentration of H
2O2 is important 
for two reasons:1) The excess H2O2 reacts with ferric ion (Fe3+) to form 
a weaker hydroperoxyl radical (HO2º ) as presented in 
Equations (3) and (4), which is not as active as ºOH radicals as confirmed by many researchers [7, 26-29].
2) Due to the high cost of H
2O2, consuming its excessive 
value is not cost-effective [7, 10].

Figs 2 and 3 shows the percentage of removing dye 
and COD as a function of the initial concentration of H2O2 
and Fe2+. The response contour (2a and 3a) and response 
surface plot (2b and 3b) in Figs 2 and 3 for different dosages of H
2O2 and Fe2+ are shown at constant concentration of 
dye (10 mg/L) and reaction time 10 min. From Figs 2 and 3 it is clear that the percentage removal of dye and COD removal increased with increasing H
2O2 until 80 mg/L. 
The effect of the Fenton process on the removal of two direct dyes, blue 2B (B54) and red 12B (R31), in aqueous solution has been studied by Malik and Saha (2003). The results denoted that the degradation rate depends on the initial concentrations of H
2O2 [28]. Lin et al. (1997) 
confirmed that when H2O2 starts to be unused in solution, Table 2. Developed quadratic models and ANOV A results using Design Expert 8.0.0 for studied responses.

the time can be considered as the end of the reaction time 
[27]. Jafari et al. (2014) mentioned the significant effect of hydrogen peroxide on the removal of azo dyes (RB-19 and RR-198) from aqueous solution. The result showed when the H
2O2/Fe2+ ratio increased, the process led to greater 
oxidation of dye and optimum H2O2 dosage was 11 mM. 
They mentioned that the decrease in removal efficiency at a high dosage of H
2O2 was due to the hydroxyl radical 
scavenging effect of H2O2 and the recombination of the 
hydroxyl radical [30].  Based on achieved results from previous research, applying stepwise for the H
2O2 addition 
could be more effective than using a large initial dosage [30-31].
The Effect of Fe2+ Concentration
The effect of Fe2+ concentration on dye and COD 
removal efficiency for 10 mg/L of RR2 is given in  
Figs 2 and 3. According to Fig. 2, maximum RR2 removal (% 98) for 10 mg/L of RR2 was obtained by using  
50 mg/L of  Fe2+, and H2O2 and reaction time were kept at 
80 mg/L and 10min, respectively. Although the 90 mg/L concentration (density) of Fe
2+ COD removal was not high 
as well as using 50 mg/L of Fe2+, which may be explained 
by redox reactions, since OH radicals might be scavenged by the reaction with the hydrogen peroxide present or with another Fe
2+ molecule according to Equations 5 and 6 [23, 
29, 32].

showed that the process efficiency increased progressively 
by increasing Fe2+ ion concentration due to a higher 
amount of ºOH radical generation. Maximum degradation efficiency about 82% was achieved at 0.90 mM of Fe
2+ for 
o- and p-cresol, while it is 0.72mM for m-cresol. A further increase in Fe
2+ ion concentration did not correspondingly 
increase its reactivity, probably due to direct reaction of ºOH radical with metal ions as mentioned in Equations 5 and 6 [33]. The results show that the H
2O2 /Fe2+ ratio is 
an important parameter in Fenton’s reactions because it directly influences the quantum yield of °OH generation [34]. Its importance was confirmed by previous studies, including Azami et al. (2013) during optimization of the azo dye removal, methyl red, from the wastewater-applied Fenton process. The results confirmed that when increasing Fe
2+, an increasing pattern is detected in the 
dye removal ratio, but increasing the Fe2+ more than a 
specific limit can lead to a fix or decrease the percentage of dye elimination and the optimum ranges of Fe
2+ was 
0.1-0.4 mM [35]. The results of studies by Jafari et al. (2014) and Tuty Emilia A. et al. (2014) showed that increasing the Fe
2+ ion above optimal dosage cannot be 
the cause of an increase in the removal efficiency because of the tendency of the HO^° to react with Fe
2+ and H2O2 in 
the oxidation-reduction reaction [4, 30].
The Effect of Reaction Time
The results show that at low doses of FR, degrading 
dye and COD was low, but by increasing the reaction time from 5 to 15 minutes the dye removal improved at all levels of H
2O2 and Fe2+ dosages (Fig. 4). According 
to the models that have been developed in this study, the coded factors (CFs) for the effluent concentration of dye as first response represents a coefficient for reaction time of 3.88, which is 6.75 times less than the coefficient for initial concentration of H
2O2 (26.22). This finding proves 
that reaction time contributed an effective function in time on the effluent concentration of dye less than H
2O2. 
The result of this study is in agreement with previous investigations on the effect of reaction time. Mousavi et al. (2011) confirmed that in low doses of FR, degrading LAS was very low but by increasing the reaction time from 20 to 80 minutes LAS removal improved to 80%. A further increase of reaction time did not show more effects on process efficiency [22]. Lin and Lo (1997) investigated the effect of reaction time on treatment of desizing sewage by the Fenton process. The result shows that after 120 minutes as the reaction time, degradation did not improve and after this reaction time H
2O2 remained in solution 
[27]. However, Mousavi et al. (2016) confirmed that the reaction time had a significant effect on the process. While the reaction time increased from 20 min to 80 min, the percentage removal of Rhodamine B increased from 35% to 55%, when other parameters were constant [10], but increasing reaction time more than a specific limit cannot lead to improved dye elimination [7, 22, 30].
Optimization Process
The experimental results were optimized by Design-
Expert software using the generated overlay plot by superimposing the contours of various response surfaces.

The optimum domain was identified by defining the 
desired limits of dye and COD removal and the shaded 
region of the overlay plot, which was considered as a promising value of the dependent variables as shown in Fig. 5. The optimum point of process operating for 
removing dye and COD was obtained at the H
2O2 of 
58 mg/L and Fe+2 of 44 mg/L. The process was operated in 
an optimized condition by accomplishing the experiments 
with optimum variables to confirm a reasonable prediction in the model. The average removing percentage of dye and COD from a repeated (thrice) test was >98%. The achieved 
results were in close agreement with the prediction of the 
model.
Conclusions
H2O2 concentration, Fe2+ concentrations, and reaction 
time play an important role on the Fenton oxidation of 
selected reactive dye RR2. The results indicate that the 
most favorable H2O2 was 80 mg/L for both dye and COD 
removal as responses. The results also show that there are 
no significant differences between different reaction times, 
when other factors were kept. Sufficient models based on the experimental results of CCD and RSM were employed 
to better understand the direct effect of such factors as 
H2O2 concentration, Fe2+ concentrations, and the reaction 
time on the process’ function and development. The 
optimum operational conditions were determined as H2O2 
of 58 mg/L and Fe2+ of 44 mg/L, with > % 98 dye removal.
