In this work, the biosorption mechanism of the cationic dye Methylene Blue (MB) on natural White Pine
sawdust (NS) ( Pinus durangensis ) was investigated. Likewise, the surface charge distribution of NS was
determined, and its point of zero charge was found to be 4.3. Besides, the capacity of the NS for adsorbingMB was increased 1.7, 2.0 and 4.6 times when the pH was raised from 3 to 4.25, 3 to 7 and 3 to 10,respectively. This behavior was attributed to the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged
surface of NS and the cationic species MB
þ. The adsorption capacity increased with increased temper-
ature because the adsorption was an endothermic process. The adsorption capacity was drasticallyreduced by increasing the ionic strength of the solution corroborating with the fact that the electrostatic
attractions played a crucial role in the adsorption of MB on NS. It was also shown that the MB was
chemisorbed because the adsorption was not reversible. The predominant adsorption mechanisms werethe electrostatic attraction and chemisorption and not ion exchange.

1. Introduction
The presence of pollutants in surface and underground water
resources as well as in wastewaters can seriously affect the eco-
systems and human health. Among these pollutants are dyes,
which can contaminate water resources due to wastewater dis-
charges from textile, leather, food processing, dyeing, cosmetics,
paper, and dye manufacturing industries [1]. The presence of dyes
in water poses a signi ﬁcant hazard to human health since many of
them are toxic, can cause allergies and irritation to the skin and the
intestinal walls, and are mutagenic and carcinogenic [2].
Several separation methods have been applied for the removal
of dyes from aqueous solutions. Recently, advanced oxidation
processes (AOPs) based upon UV radiation have been investigatedfor the degradation of dyes in water solutions [3e9]. However, the
main disadvantage of the AOPs was that the mineralization per-
centages were usually small, even though the degradation per-
centages of the dyes were nearly 100%. Thus, the formation of
unknown intermediates with lesser or greater toxicity than the
original dyes [10] can hinder the application of these AOPs.
The removal of dyes has been successfully carried out by
physicochemical processes such as separation by membranes,
coagulation eﬂocculation, adsorption and ultrasonic assisted
adsorption [11e16]. The advantages of adsorption over other
processes are easiness of operation, low-cost and a large number of
adsorbents [2]. Various types of adsorbents have been applied for
the removal of dyes including clays, zeolites, polymeric mem-
branes, xerogels, titanium oxide nanotubes, carbon nanotubes,
graphene, activated carbon and activated carbon modi ﬁed by
supporting ZnS:Cu nanoparticles [13,15e23]. It is well docu-
mented that the activated carbon presents the highest adsorption
capacity towards dyes in aqueous solution due to the chemical
nature of its surface and textural properties [2,24,25] . However, its*Corresponding author.

and development of low-cost novel adsorbents for the ef ﬁcient
removal of dyes from aqueous solution.
Very different biowastes have been applied as biosorbents for
the removal of dyes from aqueous solutions. Some of these bio-
wastes are bark, yellow passion fruit and mandarin peels, peanut
shells, rice husks, orange and banana peels, leaves from the poplar
tree, cotton, corncobs, alfalfa, bagasse, corn pericarp, agave bagasse
and wood sawdust [11,12,26 e33]. All these biowastes are widely
available and have no economic value.
Wood sawdust is a byproduct with several practical uses, but its
accumulation in soils is a serious pollution problem since sawdust
can cause diseases such as asthma, allergies, chronic bronchitis and
other respiratory problems [34]. Ferrero [11] and Hamdaoui [12]
showed that the wood sawdust is a promising low-cost material
for the treatment of polluted water containing cationic dyes since it
has a high adsorption capacity compared with other agroindustrial
wastes. However, it has been shown that the adsorption capacity of
sawdust is signi ﬁcantly dependent on the species of wood. Ferrero
[11] investigated the adsorption of Methylene Blue (MB), which is
considered a cationic dye model, on wood sawdust from walnut,cherry, oak and pine at a solution pH between 3 and 4, and found
that the adsorption capacities were 45, 38, 29 and 28 mg g
/C01,
respectively. Hamdaoui [12] studied the adsorption of MB on
sawdust from natural Cedar and reported that the uptake of MB
biosorbed was 142 mg g/C01at pH ¼7 and T ¼20/C14C. Additionally, the
experimental adsorption equilibrium data were successfully rep-
resented by the Langmuir isotherm.
In the technical literature, there is scienti ﬁc controversy over the
adsorption mechanism of cationic dyes on wood sawdust. Parab
et al. [35] concluded that the biosorption of MB on wood sawdust
was mainly controlled by chemisorption; however, Batzias and
Sidiras [36] reported that ion exchange was the primary bio-
sorption mechanism of dyes because of the chemical character of
the sawdust. A literature review showed that the mechanism
controlling the biosorption of MB on wood sawdust had not been
advanced.
The objective of this study is to elucidate the biosorption
mechanism of MB on White Pine sawdust ( Pinus durangensis ). The
elucidation of the biosorption mechanism was conducted by
determining the adsorption equilibrium at different pH, tempera-
ture and ionic strength, and studying the reversibility of bio-
sorption. The biosorption mechanism is of great interest since it
will enable understanding the dependence of the biosorption ca-
pacity on the operating conditions and improving the removal of
MB by adsorption on sawdust.
2. Materials and methods2.1. Natural sawdust
The natural sawdust (NS) used in this work was from White Pine
(P. durangensis ), which is a common pine species harvested in
Mexico [37]. The NS was washed with deionized water and
then dried in an electric oven at 80
/C14C for 24 h. The NS was milled,
sieved to an average particle of 0.63 mm and stored in a plasticcontainer.
2.2. Physicochemical properties of MB
The MB was used as a cationic dye model and was supplied by
SigmaeAldrich. Some of its physicochemical properties are Mo-
lecular weight ¼319.9 g mol
/C01,p K a¼3.8, solubility in water
of 43.6 /C2103mg L/C01at 25/C14C, and molecular projected area of
130Å2[13].2.3. Physicochemical characterization of sawdust
The functional groups on the surface of NS were identi ﬁed by
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The spectra were
obtained using the technique of Attenuated Total Re ﬂectance (ATR)
coupled to an FTIR spectrometer, Cary 660 (Agilent, USA).
The concentrations of the active sites of the NS were determined
by the acid-base titration method proposed by Boehm [38]. The
total acidic and basic sites were neutralized with 0.01 M NaOH and
HCl solutions, respectively. The total acidic sites included the car-
boxylic, phenolic and lactonic sites. Additionally, the carboxylic
sites were neutralized with 0.01 M NaHCO 3solution, and the
lactonic sites with 0.01 M Na 2CO3solution. Lastly, the phenolic sites
were estimated by subtracting the carboxylic and lactonic sites
from the total acidic sites. The titration procedure can be described
as follows. A portion of 0.1 g of the adsorbent and 45 mL of a
neutralizing solution were added to a plastic bottle. After 5 d, a
sample of the neutralizing solution (40 mL) was taken out and was
titrated with 0.01 M NaOH or HCl solution, as required. The titration
was carried out with an automatic titrator, model LD50 (Mettler-
Toledo, USA).
The surface charge distribution and the pH of the point of zero
charge (pH PZC) for the NS were evaluated by a titration procedure
described elsewhere [39]. Twenty neutralizing solutions of pH
between 2 and 12 were prepared by adding volumes between 0.4
and 16 mL of 0.1 M NaOH or HCl solutions to 100 mL volumetric
ﬂasks and diluting up to the mark with a 0.1 M NaCl solution. A
mass of 0.1 g of NS and 45 mL of neutralizing solution were added
into a 50 mL polypropylene container, and nitrogen gas was
bubbled for 2 min to prevent the formation of carbonates in the
solution. The containers were covered and, twice a day, the solution
into the container was mixed with an orbital Shaker at 300 rpm for
15 min. The above procedure was repeated without adding NS, and
these experiments were designated as blanks. After 5 d, the ﬁnal pH
of the solutions was measured using a potentiometer. The poten-
tiometric curves (volume of the neutralizing solution vs. pH ﬁnal)
corresponding to solutions with NS and without NS were plotted.
The intersection of both curves was the pH PZCof NS. The surface
charge distribution was estimated by the procedure and equations
described by elsewhere [40].
The textural properties of the NS were determined by adsorp-
tion of N 2at 77 K using a surface area and porosimeter analyzer,
Model ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics, USA).
2.4. Determination of the MB concentration in water solutions
The concentration of MB in an aqueous solution was determined
by a direct spectrophotometric method. The absorbance of a sample
was measured in a double-beam UV/Vis spectrophotometer,
UV2600 (Shimadzu, Japan), at a wavelength of 664.5 nm. Then, the
concentration of MB in a sample was estimated using a calibration
curve, concentration of the MB vs. absorbance. The calibration
curve presented a linear behavior when the concentration of the
MB ranged from 0.5 to 6 mg L/C01.
2.5. Procedure for obtaining experimental adsorption equilibrium
data
A MB stock solution having a concentration of 1000 mg L/C01was
prepared by adding 1 g of MB into a 1000 mL volumetric ﬂask and
dissolving with deionized water. Additionally, a solution with a
constant ionic strength of 0.01 M and particular pH was ﬁxed by
mixing certain volumes of 0.01 M NaOH and HCl solutions. Then, a
solution of a known initial concentration of MB and at a given pH
was prepared by adding an aliquot of the MB stock solution to aJ.J. Salazar-Rabago et al. / Sustainable Environment Research 27 (2017) 32 e40 3350 mL volumetric ﬂask and diluting to the mark with a constant
ionic strength solution. In some experiments, the ionic strength of
the MB solution was 0.05 and 0.1 M, and these solutions were ﬁxed
using 0.05 or 0.1 M NaOH and HCl solutions.
The mass of MB adsorbed on NS was determined by the
following procedure. A portion of 0.1 g of NS and 45 mL of a solution
with an initial concentration of MB ranging from 50 to 400 mg L/C01
and a particular pH were mixed in a batch adsorber (centrifuge vial
of 50 mL). The adsorber was partially immersed in a thermostatic
water bath, and the solution was mixed by placing the adsorber on
top of an orbital shaker three times daily and for 15 min. In pre-
liminary experiments, it was found that a period of four days was
enough to attain equilibrium, and during this period, the pH of the
adsorber solution was kept constant by adding few drops of 0.01 M
NaOH or HCl solutions, as necessary. The total volume of solutions
added to maintain pH constant was always less than 1 mL, and
therefore, it was considered that the volume of the adsorber solu-
tion remained constant. The mass of MB adsorbed on NS was
calculated by a mass balance of MB and the equation representing
this mass balance is the following:
qe¼VðC0/C0CeÞ
m(1)
where C 0and C eare the initial and equilibrium concentrations of
MB, respectively, mg L/C01;qeis the mass of MB adsorbed per unit
mass of NS, mg g/C01; V is the volume of the MB solution in the
adsorber, L; and m is the mass of NS, g.
2.6. Experimental desorption equilibrium data
The experimental desorption equilibrium data of MB were ob-
tained by ﬁrst performing a biosorption run, as described above,
and after reaching equilibrium, the desorption experiment started.
The latter was carried out by removing the NS saturated with MBfrom the adsorption solution and then placing the NS saturated
with MB in a 45 mL of a solution with a given pH and MB-free.
Under these conditions, the MB is desorbed from NS to the solu-
tion, and equilibrium was again attained. If the adsorption is
reversible, the desorption equilibrium data must be in the bio-
sorption isotherm at the solution pH of the desorption solution.
The mass of MB that remained adsorbed was calculated from a
mass balance of MB, which is shown below:
qd¼mq0/C0VCe
m(2)
where q 0is the mass of MB biosorbed on the NS at the beginning of
the desorption experiment, mg g/C01; and q dis the mass of MB that
remains biosorbed on the NS after desorption, mg g/C01.
2.7. Determination of the equivalents of Hþexchanged
The equivalents of Hþexchanged during the adsorption of MB
were determined by the procedure suggested by Leyva-Ramos et al.
[40]. A certain mass of NS and 45 mL of a MB-free solution at a given
pH were added to a batch adsorber, and they were left in contact for
few days. During this time, the solution pH was measured period-
ically using a pH-meter and was kept constant by adding few drops
of 0.01 M of HCl and NaOH solutions, as necessary. The MB-free
solution and the surface of NS were equilibrated when the pH did
not vary over time. Soon afterward, an aliquot of a MB standard
solution was added to the adsorber solution, and the initial con-
centration of MB in the adsorber solution was registered. It is
important to point out that the pH of the MB standard solutionmust be the same as that of the adsorber solution. The solution and
NS were left in contact for 4 d to reach equilibrium. The solution pH
was no longer adjusted but was periodically measured using a pH-
meter. After attaining equilibrium, the ﬁnal solution pH was
measured, and a sample was taken to determine the ﬁnal concen-
tration of MB at equilibrium.
The total milliequivalents of MB adsorbed by the different
mechanism, Q T, were estimated by the following equation:
QT¼qe
EW MB(3)
The milliequivalents of Hþexchanged between the solution and
the surface of NS were estimated as follows:

where EW MBis the equivalent weight of MB, mg meq/C01;p H inand

the aliquot of MB and after attaining equilibrium, respectively; Q T
represents the total milliequivalents of MB adsorbed, meq g/C01; and
V is the ﬁnal volume of the solution, L.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical characterization of natural sawdust
The concentrations of total acidic, phenolic, carboxylic and
lactonic sites of NS were 0.12, 0.08, 0.004 and 0.03 meq g/C01,
respectively, and the concentration of basic sites was 0.05 meq g/C01.
Thus, the surface of NS has an acidic character since it has a higher
concentration of acidic groups, mainly of the phenolic type.Phenolic groups are part of the molecular structure of lignin and
cellulose, which are the main components of NS.
The distribution of the surface charge of NS is presented in Fig. 1
and the pH
PZCof NS is 4.25. This value con ﬁrms that the nature of
the NS surface is acidic. The pH PZCis deﬁned as the pH value at
which the density of surface charge of the biosorbent is neutral. The
surface charge is positive when the pH of the solution is less than
pHPZCwhile it is negative for pH greater than the pH PZC. This shows
the close relationship existing between the surface functional
groups of NS and its surface charge.
Fig. 1. Surface charge distribution of NS and NS saturated with MB (C 0¼200 mg L/C01).J.J. Salazar-Rabago et al. / Sustainable Environment Research 27 (2017) 32 e40 34The pH PZCof sawdust from Maple wood was determined to be 6
[41]. This result shows that Maple sawdust surface is slightly acidic
in nature; however, the surface of NS from White Pine used in this
study is more acidic. In a previous work, the pH PZCof White Pine
sawdust was found to be 3.65, which is closed to the value reported
in this work [39].
Fig. 2 a shows the infrared spectrum of NS in the range of
800e4000 cm/C01and there are two main regions of absorption. The
bands observed in the range from 1500 to 1600 cm/C01can be
associated with the vibrations of aromatic rings present in the
structure of lignin. The pronounced band at 1000 cm/C01and the
attenuated band at 1262 cm/C01correspond to the C eO group, which
is characteristic of alcohols, esters and carboxylic acids, and all of
them are present in the molecular structures of the principal
components of NS. The carbonyl groups (C ]O) exhibited a band at
1720 cm/C01and were present in various types of hemicellulose; its
low intensity can be attributed to the low concentration of thissubstance in the NS. The band observed at 2916 cm/C01corresponded
to the C eH group, owing to cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
Lastly, the band at 3324 cm/C01was due to the O eH groups mostly
present in the cellulose [42,43] .
A zoom of the FTIR spectra of NS and NS saturated with MB
(NSþMB) is depicted in Fig. 2 b in the range from 800 to 1800 cm/C01.
In this ﬁgure, it can be observed that both spectra are similar, but
the spectrum of NS þMB exhibits two strong bands at 1596 cm/C01
(eC]Nestretching in the poly heterocycles) and 1330 cm/C01
(eCeNestretching in amine groups) and one weak band at
883 cm/C01(eCeH out-of-plane bend in aromatic rings), which are
characteristic of the MB [44]. This result corroborated the presence
of MB in the NS þMB.
3.2. Textural properties of the natural sawdust
The surface area, mean pore diameter and total pore volume of
NS were 0.4 m2g/C01, 5.1 nm and 5.0 /C210/C04cm3g/C01. In the technical
literature, similar results have been reported for sawdust from
meranti, oak, carob black, walnut, cherry and pine woods
[11,45e47]. According to the classi ﬁcation of pores suggested by the
IUPAC [48], the NS can be considered a mesoporous material since
the average pore diameter was within 2 and 50 nm.
3.3. Adsorption isotherms of MB on natural sawdust
The biosorption equilibrium data of MB on NS at various
experimental conditions were interpreted using the adsorption
isotherm models of Freundlich, Langmuir, and Redlich ePetersen,
which are represented by the following equations:
q¼kC1=n(5)
q¼qmKLC
1þKLC(6)
q¼aC
1þbCb(7)
where a is a constant of the Redlich ePeterson isotherm, L g/C01; b is a
constant of the Redlich ePeterson isotherm, Lbmg/C0b; C is the con-
centration of MB at equilibrium, mg L/C01; k is a constant of the
Freundlich isotherm, mg1/C01/nL1/ng/C01;KLis a constant of the Lang-
muir isotherm related to the heat of adsorption, L mg/C01; n is a
constant of the Freundlich isotherm; q mis the maximum mass of
MB adsorbed on the NS, mg g/C01; and bis a constant of the Red-
lichePeterson isotherm.
The parameters of the adsorption isotherms were estimated by a
least-squares method based upon the optimization algorithm of
Rosenbrock eNewton. The following objective function was
minimized:
R¼X/C16
qexp/C0qcal/C172

In addition, the absolute average percentage deviation for each
isotherm can be calculated from the following equation:

The values of the parameters and %D for the Langmuir,
Freundlich and Redlich ePetersen isotherms are reported in Table 1 .
Fig. 2. FTIR spectra of (a) NS and (b) NS and NS loaded with MB (NS þMB) (T ¼25/C14C,
pH¼10 and C 0¼500 mg L/C01).J.J. Salazar-Rabago et al. / Sustainable Environment Research 27 (2017) 32 e40 35Accordingly to the values of %D, the three models can effectively
interpret the experimental data since the values they were less
than 15.5% for all isotherm models. It was considered that the
Redlich ePeterson isotherm provided the best ﬁt to experimental
data because the %D was the lowest for 4 of the 6 cases of experi-
mental conditions (see Table 1 ). It is important to point out that the
Redlich ePetersen isotherm is a general isotherm model that can be
simpli ﬁed into the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Therefore,
the adsorption equilibrium of MB on NS was represented by the
Redlich ePetersen isotherm.
At the different experimental conditions, the adsorption ca-
pacities could not be compared using the maximum adsorption
capacity q mof the Langmuir isotherm because, in some cases, the
Langmuir isotherm did not ﬁt reasonably well the experimental
data. The adsorption capacities were compared by estimating the
uptake of MB adsorbed at an equilibrium concentration of
300 mg L/C01. This uptake was designated as Q 300and was calcu-
lated using the Redlich ePeterson isotherm. The concentration of
300 mg L/C01was chosen because this value represented the
maximum concentration where there were experimental uptake
data for all conditions.
3.4. Effect of pH on the adsorption capacity
The adsorption capacity of a biomaterial towards MB is highly
dependent on the solution pH since it affects the speciation of the
MB in solution and the surface charge distribution of the bioma-
terial. In other words, the pH can in ﬂuence the electrostatic in-
teractions of attractive or repulsive character between the species
of MB in the solution and the surface of the NS.
The MB can be present in aqueous solution as the cationic
species (MBþ) and undissociated molecules (MB/C14). The speciation
diagram of the MB is shown in Fig. 3 . As seen in this ﬁgure, the MB/C14
species predominates (86%) at pH ¼3, both MB/C14(50%) and MBþ
(50%) species coexist at pH ¼pKa¼3.8, and MBþis practically the
only species present at pH >6.
The effect of pH on the adsorption capacity of NS towards MB in
aqueous solution was investigated by obtaining the adsorption
isotherms at pH of 3, 4.25, 7 and 10. The pH of 4.25 was selected
since this pH corresponds to pH PZC.Fig. 4 illustrates the effect of pH
on the adsorption capacity, and it can be observed that the capacity
of NS for biosorbing MB increased considerably when the solution
pH was raised. The values of the adsorption capacity Q 300were 22,
31, 38 and 87 mg g/C01at pH 3, 4.25, 7 and 10, respectively. Hence, the
adsorption capacity was enhanced 1.4, 1.8 and 4.0 times while the
solution pH was increased from 3 to 4.25, 3 to 7 and 3 to 10,
correspondingly.
The low adsorption capacity of NS at pH ¼3 can be explained by
the fact that the MB is mainly found as a undissociated species,
MB/C14,(z86%) at this pH (see Fig. 3 ) and the NS surface is positively
charged at pH values <pHPZC¼4.25. Therefore, the adsorption of
MB was disfavored by the electrostatic repulsion between the MBþ
(z14%) and the surface of the NS. This result suggests the MB was
predominantly adsorbed as MB/C14on NS at pH ¼3.The gradual increase in the adsorption capacity for pH >pHPZC
was mainly due to that the cationic MBþwas the predominant
species of MB while the charge of NS surface became negative.
Additionally, the negative charge of the surface increased by raising
the solution pH. The electrostatic attraction between the MBþand
the negative surface of NS favored the adsorption capacity of NS.
To corroborate the in ﬂuence of the electrostatic attractions on
the adsorption capacity, the surface charge of the NS saturated withTable 1

of the NS saturated with MB was determined by performing
adsorption runs using the experimental conditions for evaluating
the surface charge distribution and an initial MB concentration of
200 mg g/C01and pH of 3, 4.25, 7 and 10. After attaining equilibrium,
the mass of MB adsorbed was determined and then, the surface
charge of NS saturated with MB was evaluated as describe in a
previous section. The surface charge of NS saturated with MB is
graphed in Fig. 1 , and it can be noticed that the negative charge of
the NS saturated with MB was lessened comparing with that of the
NS. This result reveals that the MBþadsorbed on the NS surface and
balanced the negative charge of NS. Hence, one of the adsorption
mechanisms of MB is the electrostatic attraction.
At pH ¼pHPZC, MB was adsorbed on NS even though the surface
charge was neutral, indicating that MB was adsorbed by other
mechanisms than electrostatic attraction. At pH <pHPZC, the positive
charge of the NS saturated with MB was increased while MB was
being adsorbed. The species of MB present at pH ¼3a r eM B/C14(86%)
and MBþ(14%) so that part of the MBþwas adsorbed increasing the
positive charge of the NS surface, but the adsorption of MBþwas due
to a mechanism different from the electrostatic attraction.
3.5. Effect of temperature in adsorption capacity
The biosorption isotherm is affected by the temperature because
it represents the thermodynamic equilibrium between MB bio-
sorbed on the surface of NS and MB in water solution. The effect of
temperature on the capacity of the NS for adsorbing MB was
analyzed by determining the biosorption isotherms of MB on NS
from aqueous solution at the temperatures of 15, 25 and 35/C14C and
pH¼10 (Fig. 5 ). The latter was selected because the maximum
adsorption capacity was observed at this pH. The values of the
adsorption capacity Q 300were 83, 87 and 108 mg g/C01at the tem-
peratures of 15, 25 and 35/C14C, correspondingly. This trend repre-
sented an increase in the adsorption capacity of 1.05 and 1.3 times,
when the temperature was elevated from 15 to 25/C14C and 25 to
35/C14C, respectively. However, for concentrations of MB at equilib-
rium less than 70 mg L/C01, the adsorption capacity of NS did not vary
with temperature, when the temperature was increased from 25 to
35/C14C. This unusual behavior can be attributed to the adsorption
mechanism of MB being dependent on the temperature and mass
of MB adsorbed.The heat of adsorption of MB onto NS was estimated by the van't
Hoff equation [49], which is shown below in its linearized form:
Ln K L¼/C0DHAd
R1
TþLn K L0 (10)
where DHadsis the heat of biosorption, J mol/C01; T is the temperature
of the solution, K; R is the ideal gas law constant, 8.31 J mol/C01K/C01;
and K L0is the pre-exponential factor, L mg/C01. The experimental
values of K ( Table 1 ) were ﬁtted to Eq. (10) and the DHadswas
estimated to be 46 kJ mol/C01, indicating that the biosorption of MB
on NS was an endothermic process. In the endothermic processes,
the adsorption equilibrium can be enhanced by increasing the
temperature. This explains why the adsorption capacity increased
with temperature. It is important to point out that the DHadswas
closed to 42 kJ mol/C01, corresponding to a chemical reaction or
interaction [50]. Thus, a part of MB was chemisorbed on NS.
3.6. Effect of ionic strength
The effect of the ionic strength of the solution on the adsorption
capacity of NS was studied to examine the importance of the
electrostatic interactions during the biosorption process. Schiewer
and Volesky [51] and Rivera-Utrilla and S /C19anchez-Polo [52] reported
that the presence of electrolytes can in ﬂuence the strength of
electrostatic interactions between the adsorbate and the bio-
sorbent surface due to a screening effect.
Fig. 6 shows the uptake of MB biosorbed on NS at an initial MB
concentration of 300 mg L/C01, pH of 3, 7 and 10, and ionic strengths
of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10 M. The results graphed in this ﬁgure revealed
that the mass of MB adsorbed was drastically reduced by increasing
the ionic strength of the solution, corroborating that the electro-
static attraction played a signi ﬁcant role in the adsorption of MB on
NS. Han et al. [53] found similar trend for the adsorption capacity of
chaff towards MB. The reduction of the mass of MB adsorbed
caused by increasing the ionic strength was much more signi ﬁcant
for pH ¼10 than pH ¼3. This trend was attributed to that the
electrostatic attractions were more important at the pH ¼10. At an
ionic strength of 0.01 M, the adsorption capacity increased drasti-
cally by raising the solution pH, whereas, at an ionic strength of
0.1 M, the adsorption capacity was almost independent on thesolution pH. The adsorption of Na
þcations on the surface of NS

the electrostatic attraction between the MBþand the surface of NS
was decreased causing a reduction in the adsorption capacity of NS.
This behavior is known as the screening effect.
3.7. Reversibility of the biosorption of MB
The purpose of studying the reversibility of the biosorption
process was to obtain additional information on the nature of the
interactions occurring in the adsorption of MB on the surface of NS.
If the biosorption was reversible, the biosorption mechanism would
be due to weak interactions (electrostatic or dispersive). On the
other hand, if the adsorption of MB was irreversible, then the
interaction between MB and the surface of NS would be strong, and
part of MB can be chemisorbed on NS.
The reversibility of the biosorption of MB on NS was investi-
gated by carrying out adsorption experiments at pH ¼10, and then
desorption experiments at pH 10 or 3. The adsorption isotherms
and the experimental adsorption and desorption equilibrium data
of MB on NS are plotted in Fig. 7 a for adsorption and desorption at
pH¼10, and in Fig. 7 b for the adsorption at pH ¼10 and
desorption at pH ¼3. The adsorption data were designated as Ads
and desorption data as Des.Fig. 7 a shows that desorption equi-
librium data at pH ¼10 are on the adsorption isotherm at the same
pH when the concentration of MB at equilibrium is less than
5m gL/C01, indicating that the biosorption was reversible. However,
the biosorption was irreversible for concentrations of MB at
equilibrium greater than 5 mg L/C01. This behavior showed that the
MB was mainly adsorbed by a reversible mechanism for MB con-
centrations at equilibrium less than 5 mg L/C01, whereas for MB
concentrations greater than 5 mg L/C01, the biosorption probably
occurred by two mechanisms. One of the mechanisms was
reversible, i.e., electrostatic attraction and the other was irre-
versible, i.e., chemisorption.
The desorption equilibrium data of MB at pH ¼3 shown in
Fig. 7 b indicated the data were not on the biosorption isotherm at
pH¼3, revealing that the biosorption was not reversible at this pH.
A signi ﬁcant amount of MB was desorbed when the desorption step
was carried out at pH ¼3. These results suggest that one of the
biosorption mechanisms of MB is chemisorption or a chemical
interaction. Furthermore, these results indicate that the sawdust
can be partially regenerated by desorbing the MB from the sawdust
saturated with MB using a water solution at pH ¼3.
3.8. Biosorption mechanism of MB
The results of the effect of the pH on the biosorption equilib-
rium of MB showed that the adsorption capacity of the NS towards
MB increased drastically by raising the pH. At pH values of 7 and
10, the dominant species was the cationic MBþand was attracted
electrostatically by the negatively charged surface of NS, and the
electrostatic attraction was stronger when the solution pH was
increased. However, the electrostatic attraction was not the only
adsorption mechanism of MB since the NS presented a reasonably
good adsorption capacity towards MB at pH ¼3, even though the
electrostatic interactions did not favor the adsorption. At pH ¼3,
the molecule of MB was as the neutral species MB/C14and the surface
of NS was positively charged. Under these experimental condi-
tions, the adsorption of MB can be attributed, in part, to pep
dispersive interactions between the p-electrons of the aromatic
rings of the MB and the p-electrons from the aromatic rings of
lignin [52]. Moreover, the reversibility experiments showed that
adsorption of MB was not reversible, indicating that the adsorption
mechanism of MB on NS was due to weak as well as strong in-
teractions between the surface of NS and MB.The contribution of ion exchange in the adsorption of MB was
evaluated by determining the equivalents of protons displaced
from the NS during the adsorption of MB. The milliequivalents of
Hþexchanged from the surface of NS to the solution during bio-
sorption, Q IEx, were assumed to be equal to the uptake of MBþ
adsorbed on the surface of NS by ion exchange. The uptake of MBadsorbed by other mechanisms (Q
OM) was the difference between
the total uptake of MB adsorbed (Q T) and the uptake of MB
adsorbed by ion exchange (Q IEx). Electrostatic attractions, disper-
sive interactions and chemisorption are included in other
mechanisms.
Table 2 shows the experimental data for the milliequivalents of
Hþexchanged from the surface of the NS during the adsorption of
MB, and it can be observed that the amount of MB adsorbed by ion
exchange can be considered negligible compared to the contribu-
tion of other mechanisms. Moreover, Q IExpresented negative
values at pH inz3.0 indicating that the protons were exchanged
from the solution to the surface of NS in the same direction as MBFig. 7. Adsorption edesorption isotherms of MB on NS. Adsorption at pH ¼10 and
desorption at pH ¼10 (a). Adsorption at pH ¼10 and desorption at pH ¼3 (b).
T¼25/C14C. The lines represent the Redlich ePeterson isotherm.J.J. Salazar-Rabago et al. / Sustainable Environment Research 27 (2017) 32 e40 38was being adsorbed. In other words, the cationic MBþcompeted
with Hþfor the active sites of NS. Furthermore, the contribution
percentage by other mechanisms (%OM) was estimated by the
following equation:
%OM ¼QOM
QT/C2100% (11)
The values of %OM are also given in Table 2 and are practically
100% for pH values of 7 and 10. This result corroborated that MB
was primarily adsorbed on NS by mechanisms such as electrostatic
attraction (particularly at basic pH values), dispersive interactions
and chemisorption.
4. Conclusions
It was found that the surface of the NS was acidic because of the
phenolic groups from the lignocellulosic materials. The acidic na-
ture of NS was also corroborated by its pH of the point zero charge
of 4.25 and the infrared spectrum of the NS demonstrated the
presence of the phenolic groups in the NS.
The experimental biosorption equilibrium data of the MB on NS
were interpreted using the isotherm models of Langmuir, Freund-
lich and Redlich ePeterson. In general, the Redlich ePeterson
isotherm provided the best ﬁt since this isotherm presented the
lowest absolute percentage average deviation.
The uptake of MB adsorbed on NS was highly dependent on the
solution pH. The capacity of NS for biosorbing MB was increased 1.7,
2.0 and 4.6 times when the pH was raised from 3 to 4.25, 3 to 7 and
3 to 10, respectively. This enhancement was due to the increase in
the electrostatic attractions between the cationic MBþin the so-
lution and the negatively charged surface of NS.
The effect of temperature revealed that adsorption of MB on NS
was an endothermic process, and its heat of adsorption was
46 kJ mol/C01. For this reason, the adsorption capacity of NS was
favored by increasing the temperature.
The main adsorption mechanism of MB on the NS from water
solutions was the electrostatic attraction, especially at basic pH.
This result was con ﬁrmed by noticing that the uptake of MB
adsorbed increased by raising the pH of the solution and by
reducing the ionic strength of the solution. Both effects can be
attributed to the electrostatic attraction between the cationic MBþ
and the negatively charged surface of NS. The reversibility studiesdemonstrated that the adsorption was not reversible. Hence,
chemisorption was another mechanism contributing to the bio-
sorption of MB, although to a lesser extent.Acknowledgements
