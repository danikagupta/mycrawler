combination system ABSTRACT
Owing to the water crisis, the development of innovative and clean advanced oxidation processes to decompose a 
variety of harmful organic compounds in wastewater becomes the main challenge for many research teams. Cold discharge plasma is one of the most widely studied and developed processes, owing to its low energy cost and 
easy to operate. The impact of different factors on the decontamination effectiveness of discharge plasma are 
detailed in this review. The generation and reaction mechanisms of reactive species in discharge plasma systems have also gained a significant interest and hence discussed. Several potentials and laboratory-scale reactor design 
recently reported are discussed and schematically presented. The recent combination of discharge plasma 
decontamination and other processes in both post and pre-treatment configuration are reported. Some appli
-
cations of water treatment based on discharge plasma at the pilot scale have been addressing.   
1.Introduction
The increasing demand for clean water, due to the fast-growing
world population, has pushed scientists to develop various conven -
tional processes for wastewater treatment such as physical, chemical, 
and biological water treatment. Among them, chemical techniques are 
widely used. However, all these techniques have several disadvantages, 
like inorganic solid and unreacted chemical residues [1–3]. To overcome 
these issues, researchers have focused on advanced oxidation processes 
(AOPs), like photo-Fenton [1] and non-thermal plasma (NTP) tech -
niques [2–4]. 
The application of plasmas in water treatment has gained immense 
attention due to its simplicity, effectivity for destroying toxic organic compounds in both raw water and wastewater, economy, and environ
-
mentally friendly side [5,6]. 
In the last years, plasma-liquid systems have attracted considerable 
attention of researchers on a variety of applications domains that include, i.e., environmental and wastewater remediation [7,8], nanomaterial processing [9,10], cancer cells treatment [11], steriliza
-
tion and disinfection [12], bacterial biofilm prevention and eradication 
[13]and analytical chemistry [14,15] … etc. In particular, plasma
treatment techniques have been tested: i) for the decomposition of many 
harmful compounds from water, including; herbicide [16], pesticides 
[17], phenols [7,18], organic dyes [19], As3, Cr6, Fe3, Cu2and Zn2
[20,21], biomolecules, Virus and bacterial Inactivation [22–25], phar -
maceuticals [26,4] and veterinary antibiotics [27]; ii) For the possible 
removing of chemical and biological wastes in all three states; gas, liquid 
and solid [28]; for the enhancement of biodegradability of coking 
wastewater [29]. 
In this review, various aspects dealing with wastewater treatment by 
electrical discharge plasma are discussed in detail. Among them, the 
reaction mechanism for different discharge plasma conceptions, 
numerous classifications according to various criteria, the effect of 
different parameters on the process efficiency, some advanced reactor 
designs, and the development of combined processes involving 
discharge plasma as a post or pretreatment step. On the other hand,

In recent years the use of discharge plasma for the elimination and/
or the complete mineralization of both hazardous organic compounds 
(Pharmaceuticals products and synthetic dyes) and pathogenic bacteria 
in wastewater have gained continuous growth and development [30, 
31]. Plasma is a source of high electric field, energetically charged 
particles, oxidizing species (radicals and molecules), reductive species (Hydrogen atom, Nitrogen atom and aqueous electron…etc) [7] (Fig.1), 
ultrasound, UV light, electrohydraulic cavitations, as well as even 
shockwaves [3,5,32]. 
Two distinguishing effects can be caused by discharge plasma in 
contaminated water purification: i) direct effects resulting from electron 
collisions and ii) other impacts generated by ionic, molecular (H
2O2, O2 
and O 3) and a host of chemically active species in-situ generated (≡OH, 
O≡, O2≡– and H≡) via pyrolysis and photolysis reactions [33]. As reported 
in Fig.2, theses oxidants/reactants have different life times and oxida -
tion potentials [7,34,35]. Nevertheless, aqueous pollutants can also be 
destroyed by reductive degradation pathways under the effect of some 
reductive species, such as aqueous electron (E•H2O/e aq -2.77 V) [36] 
and H≡radicals (E•H2O/H≡-2.30 V) [37]. 
It is worthy to note that electrical discharges in liquids launch 
various chemical and physical impacts responsible for the harmful mi -
croorganisms deactivation: i) the electromechanical compression phe -
nomenon is responsible for the inactivation of bacterial cells by 
initiating pores in the membrane cells; ii) a deformation of cells struc -
ture could be caused by shock waves in the range of 5 – 20 kBar; iii) 
organism mutation may be prompted by intense UV radiations when 
ranged between 200 and 400 nm [31]. 
Some aspects must be noted in view to understand what happened in 
an aqueous medium during discharge plasma. Firstly, when the plasma 
is initiated there is a considerable increase in temperature (heating rate 
≪109 K.s-1) and secondly a limited volume of water prevents the plasma 
to spread freely and then a high pressure (105-107 MPa) is generated as a 
result [28]. In an incompressible medium, the high pressure would 
transform into impact shockwave, leading to plasma generation as final 
step [5,38,39], as the result of high-voltage discharge followed by 
electromagnetic field that can sterilize water and wastewater [40,41]. 
The resultant shockwave can produce pyrolysis [42] and chemical re -
actions in the bulk liquid indirectly by electrohydraulic cavitations [43]. 
The mechanism of wastewater decontamination by high-voltage 
electrical discharge can be divided, according to the plasma-phase distribution or reactor operating principles, mainly into three cate -
gories, specifically, electrical discharges above the liquid surface, 
interface plasma-liquid discharge, and direct electrical liquid discharge 
[5]:  
a)Discharge in the gas phase above the liquid (Fig.3 .a),
b)Direct discharges in the liquid phase (Fig.3 .b),
c)Discharge in multiphase environments or Hybrid gas-liquid system
(bubbles/vapor in liquids) (Fig.3 .c).
2.1. Electrical discharges plasma above liquid surface (nonthermal 
plasma) 
Plasma driven in the gas phase and contact with water vapor (with 
the help of both plasma electrons and excited species energies), so-called 
indirect discharge, creates a large number of reactive oxygen species, as 
well as nitrate, nitrite and NO radicals as reported in Eq. 1 to 15 [5,44, 
45].

These discharges have resemblances with contact glow discharge 
electrolysis when the metal anode is flooded in the liquid, and the 
plasma is produced in a vapor layer [46]. In these discharges, a 
considerable portion of the discharge power is squandered into the liquid causing high liquid evaporation rates [47]. In such a system, less 
energy from the discharge plasma is used to generate active species. 
2.2. Discharge plasma in liquid-gas interface 
Interface plasma-liquid discharge, also called discharges in bubbles/ 
vapor on the liquid surface [7], is characterized by a large contact sur
-
face area. The latter conducts to high effectiveness for gaseous species to 
diffuse inside the liquid and less energy required to produce the plasma 
than direct discharge in the liquid. Also, at the gas-liquid interface, 
extremely Reactive Species such as H 2O, H≡, O3, OH, or HO≡
2 could be 
produced≡, and these species would support the destruction of the target 
pollutants [48–50]. On the one hand, the reaction formation of 
hydrogen peroxide by hydroxyl radical recombination is notified in Eq. 
16 to19 [51]. 
2HO≡→H 2O2 (16) 
It can take place in the gas, the liquid, or at the interface through the 
following reactions. 2HO

2HO≡aq→H 2O2aq (18)  
2HO≡
int→H 2O2int (19) On the other hand, in an atmospheric discharge plasma, a massive 
flow of electrons is colliding at the water-air interface, inducing a highly 
reactive interfacial dissolved electrons (aq.) in high concentration [52]. 
That including other ROS significant amount of ≡OH radicals are also 
produced near the interface. 
2.3. Direct electrical discharges in liquid (electrohydraulic discharge) 
The discharge plasma in an aqueous medium is generated by nano -
second pulsed power, DC voltages [50], and/or AC excitation using 
50–60 Hz up to GHz microwave excitation [53]. It is also required more 
energy than the electrical discharges above the water level. Moreover, 
the residence time of plasma is very-short in water because of 
exchanging high energy electrons with the surrounding water medium 
(in the case of non-thermal plasma, for example). Indeed, the direct 
electrical discharge applied in water generates elevated temperature 
plasma channels, creating electrohydraulic cavitations, supercritical 
water oxidation, as well as the establishment of short-lived radicals by 
ultraviolet photolysis [54]. 
Nevertheless, electrical discharges plasma in water include a simple 
system and produce chemically active species directly in water that 
could effectively offense the dissolved contaminants [55]. 
The essential reactions responsible for free radical production and 
termination, in the case of electrical discharges in water, and their 
corresponding rate constants (k) are listed below [44,55,56] in Eq., 20 to 
35.

3. Parameters affecting electrical discharge in water treatment
efficiency
3.1. Input power 
Input 
power applied in discharge Plasma plays an essential role in 
the degradation and/or mineralization efficiency of pollutants, where 
the increase in input power leads to an enhancement in the removal rate 
[45,57]. Chen et al. reported the degradation of phenol by pulsed 
high-voltage discharge plasma in an aqueous medium. These authors 
found that increasing supply voltage from 7 to 10 kV increases the 
removal efficiency from 55 to 86% [2]. A similar result was found by 
Kim et al. [27,58]. These results were mainly attributed to the increase 
in the amount of highly chemically active species produced by 
increasing the input voltage [59]. 
The increasing electron concentration can explain the relationship 
between input power and the degradation yield in the reaction medium, 
more ozone production [60], high intensity of ultraviolet radiation [61] 
and the generation of a large number of reactive oxygen species such as 
O≡and O≡H [62,63]. In other words, as the input power rises, electrons 
acquire a higher amount of energy in the electric field, and hence, as a result of the collision, further ionization of oxygen and water molecules 
is induced [64]. 
3.2. Pollutant`s initial concentration 
As reported in several works, the initial concentration of pollutants 
significantly affects the removal rate. On the one hand, it is apprized that 
the increase in pollutant concentration increases the reaction rate until 
the generation of active species becomes the limiting step in the process [57]. On the other hand, the increase in the pollutant concentration 
decreases the removal efficiency as well as the Chemical Oxygen De
-
mand (COD), as reported by Tao et al., for methyl orange degradation [19]. This finding could be explained by the fact that there is a 
competition between the available active species produced by discharge 
plasma and pollutant molecules and/or its generated intermediates 
species (at low initial pollutant concentration). [45,58,63]. 
3.3. Water conductivity 
It is essential to take into consideration the solution conductivity, to 
be treated in the discharge plasma process, regarding decontamination 
efficiency [65]. A high electrical conductivity of water, owing to high 
ions concentration, can cause a high current flow, and a large amount of 
chemically active species could be generated. For example, as reported 
by Clements et al., weak discharge plasma is observed in deionized 
water [66]. On the contrary, Jiang et al. found that increasing the me
-
dium conductivity leads to a decrease in the removal efficiency of methyl orange [67]. They have suggested that the high discharge cur
-
rent leads to more intense UV light and vigorous acoustic waves for -
mation, which favors heating of the solution [5]. Then less energy is 
exploited to produce H 2O2, O3, and to destruct the organic contaminant. 
It appears, therefore, that the concentration of produced reactive 
ions in the plasma is limited by an optimum electrical conductivity of the 
solution. If the water conductivity is beyond an optimum value, this could decrease the discharge plasma efficiency due to the fast compensation of the space charge electric field on the streamer head 
(shorter streamer channel length), and hence fewer active species are produced [38]. 
Also, Abdelaziz and his co-workers reported that the effect of solu
-
tion conductivity on the power consumption is only noticeable at rela -
tively high applied voltage, i.e., when the plasma channels spread in the bubbles inside the solution. Nevertheless, the solution conductivity had 
no role in the degradation efficiency and the pH of the treated solution at 
the same input power [68]. 
3.4. Effects of reactor design and discharge gap 
It has been found that the distance between electrodes, i.e., the 
discharge gap, plays an essential role in the degradation efficiency of 
harmful compounds because changing electrode distance leads to a 
change in the electric field intensity. Accordingly, different electrical 
discharge types have been tested; some of them are shown in Fig.4 [39]. 
As reported by Chen et al., the increase in electrodes distance increases the time needed to achieve a given removal efficiency of pollutants [69]. 
From another hand Sano et al. in their work on the degradation of 
organic compounds in water reported that cathode-anode gap has an 
optimal value at a given voltage input to achieve a maximum Rhoda
-
mine B degradation yield [70]. 
Stratton et al. notified that the discharge plasma area increases with 
increasing the grounded electrode diameter or surface at fixed elec -
trodes distance [71]. It can be concluded that the design of electrodes 
must assure a uniform plasma distribution and a possible sizeable 
electrical discharge area [7]. 
3.5. Feed gas composition 
In the discharge plasma treatment technology, the input gas quality 
and quantity showed a remarkable effect on the treatment process. Kim 
et al. investigated the effect of oxygen concentration on the degradation 
of antibiotics and found that oxygen showed better efficiency as 
compared to dry air [27]. 
Manoj Kumar Reddy et al. found that the increase in gas flow rate 
increases the removal efficiency of pollutants by increasing the number of reactive species produced and ozone generated. However, beyond a 
limit value of gas flow rate, no degradation efficiency enhancement is 
noticeable. These results are verified by the increasing of measured 
unreacted O
3 concentration at the system outlet [45]. 
3.6. Effects of reactive ions on pollutant removal efficiency 
Many works focused on the effect of different ions on the removal 
efficiency and the degradation of energy yield by discharge plasma. 
Interestingly, the addition of Na 2SO4 in the treatment system generates 
SO4≡– ions (E 0 2.6 V) (Eq. 36), which has a powerful oxidation effect 
comparable to hydroxyl radicals [45,72]. 
SO 2

Also, sulfate radical has an interesting capacity to attack dye mole -
cules at different positions leading to a fast fragmentation of chromo -
phores [73]. Nevertheless, the increase of SO 4≡– ions in the discharge 
plasma medium leads to an increase in the degradation efficiency until a 
certain amount. In contrast, beyond this amount, they become ineffi -
cient because of the recombination of reactive radicals and the balance generation at the high amount of the reactive species produced (Eq. 37 
and 38) [74].

8 (38) The presence of inorganic mineral pollutants, such as Fe2has 
showed a positive effect on the degradation efficiency in both photo -
catalysis [75] and electrical discharge plasma [76–78], since it can react 
with H 2O2 and then leading to the production of more powerful reactive 
species [79]. For instance, the H 2O2 reacts with Fe2ions and produces 
secondary oxygen species (HO 2≡) with high oxidizing power, as reported 
in Eq. 39–41. [80–82]: 
Fe2H2O2→Fe3OH≡HO≡(39)  
Fe2HO≡→Fe3OH≡(40)  
Fe3H2O2→Fe2HO≡
2H(41) 
In their work, Marotta et al. found that there is no signification effect 
of being noticed with a varying iron concentration in the aqueous so -
lution. They explained that by the deficient H 2O2 concentration (D1.5 
10-4 M), namely below the detection limit and too low for observing a
catalytic effect by iron ions [54]. 
The presence of NaCl, as chloride source, was found to harm the 
degradation efficiency [72] because chloride ion reacts with the hy -
droxyl radicals, as illustrated in Eq. 42 to 46 [83].

3.7. The pH of the reaction medium 
The pH is a parameter that plays a crucial role in the evaluation of the 
efficiency of discharge plasma-based technique. Several studies showed 
a proportional relationship between pH and the degradation efficiency 
of a variety of treated hazardous molecules [27,58,84]. This fact can be 
explained by the decomposition rate of ozone into more powerful 
oxidant “hydroxyl radicals” favored under basic pH due to the presence 
of OH- ions [59], as shown in Eq. 47 to 50 [85,86]:

In alkaline conditions, the ozone was as well described to be 
decomposed into superoxide ions according to the following reactions 
(Eq. 51–54) [87]:

Fig. 4. Reactor design on discharge plasma characteristics: a) discharge gap and b) electrodes surface.  Moreover, many works have reported a high degradation rate in
acidic conditions for different pollutants, such as dyes and phenols 
[88–91]. Under acidic condition the ozone is available as molecular 
ozone and with increasing pH from acidic to alkaline the oxidizing po -
tential of ozone decreased from 2.08 V to 1.4 V [92]. Also, there is a 
possible consumption of hydroxyls radicals by reacting with; i) car -
bonate ions [89] and ii) superoxide ions at increasing pH [93]. 
4. Discharge plasma types
Different criteria can be found in the classification of discharge
plasmas: i) according to the gas temperature, ii) electron and ion tem -
peratures and plasma density, iii) operating pressure (Equilibrium 
plasmas at high pressure ≽105 Pa and non-equilibrium plasmas at at -
mospheric pressure or lower) and current magnitude, iv) powering 
mode, v) thermodynamic equilibrium (Equilibrium or thermal and non- 
equilibrium or non-thermal plasmas) and ionization degree ( the 
density of charged particles/the total density of species including 
neutral and charged particles, partially ionized (10 4-10 6) to 
completely ionized (e.g., stars and visible interstellar matter) [94]. 
Plasma is a partially ionized gas, which can be generated by various 
electrical discharges and can be classified into two main groups, in other 
words, thermal and non-thermal, in terms of electronic density, pres -
sure, or temperature. Thermal plasma (usually arc discharges, torches, or radiofrequency) is accompanied by enough energy added to permit 
plasma elements to be in thermal equilibrium (T
e ≪Tgas). Whereas non- 
thermal plasma is attained using less power when an energetic electron temperature much higher than that of the bulk-gas molecules (Fig. 5). 
Different technologies, in the discharge plasma, based on high- 
voltage electrical discharges directly in the water (electrohydraulic 
discharge) or in the gas phase overhead the water (non-thermal plasma) 
has been reported in the literature, such as pulsed corona discharges [95, 
96], dielectric barrier discharges [19], gliding arc [97] and contact glow 
discharge electrolysis [55,98]. 
Such mechanisms remain less understood, hence the inferences from 
various studies available in the literature in certain aspects are contra
-
dictory owing to a wide variety of the investigated systems and the 
involved process variables. Owing to these reasons, the comparison of 
the discharge reactors’ performance considered in proportion to their 
configurations is not possible, which given their great diversity, would 
have been interesting. Although the experimental conditions are 
different in various studies, the results could be discussed based on the energy efficiency (yield) of pollutant removal, and many researchers 
have used energy efficiency to compare their results to other 
researchers. 
The Table 1 summarizes an inexhaustive list about types of plasma 
applied for pollutant removal as well as operating conditions. A variety 
of different reactors with liquid phase classified according to the 
discharge type (DBD, Corona and contact glow discharge) have been 
developed and tested for the removal of harmful organic compound 
from water. It is easy to note a great disparity of the removal efficiency 
and the treatment time for the same compound from a reactor config -
uration to another whether in the same discharge type or a different one. 
Also, a wide range of concentrations for treated pollutants have been 
reported from a few milligrams to hundreds or even thousands of 
milligrams. 
4.1. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) 
This micro-plasma category, which is also called silent discharges, 
was developed for the first time for ozone generation and then gener -
alized in different applications, such as surface treatment [30,113] and 
gas purification. In this kind of system, the electrical discharge generally 
occurs between electrodes, with the condition that a thin layer of 
dielectric material covers at least one of the electrodes (e.g., quartz, 
glass, ceramics, mica, and alumina) or one of these materials is placed in 
the discharge gap [29]. The aqueous solution can also act as the second 
electrode in the DBD system [30]. 
Several works underlined the importance of ozone generation during 
recalcitrant compound degradation because of its long lifetime, 
compared to the other oxidizing species [27]. 
This type is classified as cold plasma formed at low/atmospheric 
pressure systems; it has the advantage of the low operating cost that is 
ascribed to limited consumption of power and gas. Interestingly, in the 
past years, various DBD reactors geometries with different electrode 
configuration were proposed for the treatment of multiple wastewaters 
[19,114,115]. That emphasizes the fact that water treatment is attract -
ing more attention from the researchers. 
4.2. Contact glow discharges 
Contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE) is an unconventional 
process in the advanced oxidation process (AOPs), where electro -
chemical reactions take place midst of an electronic conductor (elec -
trodes) and the surrounding ionic conductor surface (electrolyte). This 
system induces charge transfer across the interface between the elec -
trodes and the electrolyte if the applied voltage is sufficiently high 
enough [116,117]. Various types of electrolytes have been described in 
the literature, aqueous electrolytes [118], solid electrolytes [119], and 
molten salts or ionic liquids [120,121]. 
In the contact glow discharge electrolysis, the cathode is immersed in 
water and isolated from the anode using the porous glass. A continuous 
DC voltage is exercised to a thin wire anode communicating with the 
water surface [55]. In this type of plasma, the temperature of almost 
species in the discharge zone (anions, cations, and neutral species) is 
increased. They are produced with much higher yields than in conven -
tional electrolysis in both gas phase and aqueous solution [122]; so, the plasma generated in the reactors can be called hot plasma [123]. In such 
a system, H
2O2 is the main species formed in the liquid phase, and H 2 is 
formed in the gas phase. 
4.3. Corona discharges 
Pulsed corona discharge is usually generated in a needle to plate 
electrode configuration (e.g., tips, pinpoints, or thin wires), where a 
needle is connected to the high-voltage terminal, and the plate is earthed 
[124,55]. The electrodes materials may be made from copper, 
ceramic-coated stainless-steel, titanium, etc. [125–127]. 
 Fig. 5. Different classification of discharges plasma.  The pulseless in the corona system can generate a high flux of elec -
trons from DC electrical discharge in gas or liquid media. Then a large 
amount of oxidizing chemical species are produced. The discharge in 
water with air or oxygen bubbling can produce H 2O2 and O 3 as the main 
chemically active molecules [3,38]. 
As reported in different works, the relative density of ≡OH, H and O 
≡≡generated depends on the nature of bubbled gas [66,128]. The DC 
corona has the advantage of continuous radical species generation and 
the disadvantage of high energy consumption as compared to the pulsed 
electrical corona because of the continuous operation [7]. Electrical

Some hazardous chemicals and electrical discharge type and reactors  5. Reactor configuration
In the use of discharge plasma to treat contaminants, there are
different influencing parameters; among them, the reactor geometry is a 
crucial factor. 
Malik et al. compared the relative energy generates about 
27 different types of plasma reactors [129]. The results of energy yield obtained from the degradation of organic compounds in water were 
found to follow the order: 1) pulsed DC Dcontinuous DC or AC power, 2) 
pulsed corona discharges Dpulsed dielectric barrier discharges DDC 
discharges, 3) burning plasma in oxygen (Bubbling with oxygen) Dair D
liquid, 4) treated solution as fine droplets in the plasma zone Dthin film 
Ddeep layer [129]. 
A variety of reactor configurations were recently reported in 
different works; among them, plate to plate DBD to treat liquid film 
falling by gravity showed the best result [130]. This prototype reactor can be coupled with TiO
2, which drastically enhances the mineralization 
yield of pollutants and reduces energy consumption. Moreover, in the DBD system, a cascade of two DBD plasma systems can be used in series, 
separated by an interface in the center (used as supporting gas intro
-
duction region), to imply changes in plasma chemistry characteristics and the radical’s formation [31]. 
Hijosa-Valsero et al. reported that the energy efficiency of the DBD 
coaxial thin-falling-water-film reactor (Fig.6) is higher than a DBD 
conventional batch reactor. However, the degradation of kinetic is 
slightly higher in the last reactor configuration [131]. Dojcinovic et al. 
reported a similar reactor configuration for the degradation of four reactive textile dyes (Reactive Black 5, Reactive Blue 52, Reactive Yel
-
low 125, and Reactive Green 15). The study revealed that the addition of H
2O2 and Fe2in the dye solution enhanced the decolonization effi -
ciency at the optimized conditions of applied energy density, pH, and residence time [132]. 
Tao et al. proposed a novel configuration of a DBD reactor. This 
continuous pilot DBD system is composed of two co-axial quartz tubes 
and a stainless-steel disk electrode and one stainless steel mesh electrode 
(Fig. 7). The wastewater is pumped up through the inner quartz tube to 
the top of the tube, then falling in the annular region between the two 
tubes. Thus, two distinct discharges are generated: i) between the 
stainless-steel disk electrodes and ii) between the steel disk electrode in 
the water and the stainless-steel mesh electrode. Therefore, these dis
-
charges lead to efficient degradation of high concentrated methyl or -
ange solution [19]. A similar reactor, “falling film dielectric barrier 
discharge,” was proposed by Rong and Sun, where the treated solution is 
directly pumped to the top of the reactor via an external canal [78]. 
Wang et al. reported in their work for the degradation of dimethyl 
phthalate a surface discharge plasma reactor in which the plasma was initiated in the gaseous environment. Then the generated actives species 
were transfused quickly into the wastewater [44] This kind of reactor 
was first developed by Ogata et al. for VOCs treatment [133], and later 
Li et al. has used this type of reactor for treatment and sterilization of 
water, wastewater [134,135]. 
Some reactor geometries, developed by researchers, can have many 
tasks at the same time. For example, the DBD plasma plume array 
developed for textile modification by Chen et al., could be used for both 
fabric-fiber surface treatment and aqueous textile effluent decontami -
nation by using discharge plasma produced by-products such as radicals, ozone, and ions [30]. 
Jiang et al. have compared the following four prototype plasma re
-
actors for the treatment of dye solution under similar operating condi -
tions: (i) batch reactor with a needle–plate electrodes (BR); (ii) only 
liquid circulating system (OLC) with gas directly flowing outside from 
discharge reactor; (iii) hybrid gas-liquid electrical discharge (GL) and ; 
(iv) gas discharge circulatory airtight reactor system (GDC). They found
that the pollutant degradation rate followed the following trend; GDC F
GL FOLC FBR. However, 
interestingly the energy efficiency of
pollutant removal decreased in the following order: GDC FOLC FGL F
BR [
67].
Liu et al. studied the removal of Carbamazepine with two electrical 
discharge modes, 
ex-situ and in situ, directly on the water surface. The 
results showed very high efficiency for the ex-situ mode [136]. This 
result can be explained by the formation of NOx in-situ mode that leads 
to a decrease in the pH and their competition with produced ozone. 
Besides, scaling up the discharge plasma reactor can enhance the 
efficiency of the process. Indeed, the improvement of the mass transfer 
of the reactive species and the interaction between the plasma and so -
lution reduces energy consumption [137]. 
In 2017, Ajo et al. studied the hydroxyl radical transfer through the 
Gas-Liquid Interface utilizing a pulsed corona discharge (PCD) reactor, with water sprayed into the plasma zone, through an atomizer array 
[138]. The vertical wire-plate designed reactor is equipped with an 
adjustable pulse generator to deliver identical pulses. Water was 
sprayed, using five axial-flow full cone atomizer nozzles, from the top 
into direct contact with the plasma, and the treated solution is with
-
drawn from the bottom in holding tank (Fig. 8). The results reported that the 
≡OH radicals are yielded at the interface on the gas side (i.e., from 
water vapor), and not in the liquid phase. Furthermore, the gas-liquid interface is a significant barricade for efficient oxidation of aqueous 
compounds by 
≡OH.

Fig. 7. Two-level dielectric barrier discharge reactor.  6. Plasma in combined processes
Discharges plasma are fast and efficient technique for the treatment
of the different family of pollutants. The NTP DBD discharge could 
mineralize, partially or entirely, the contaminants. Nevertheless, the 
degradation mechanism is not unique; indeed, it improves the biode -
gradability of the organic pollutants [139]. This technique can be used 
alone or coupled with another process such as: photocatalysis [56,57], 
biodegradation [29], catalytic effects of activated carbon fibers [108], 
adsorbents, catalysts, ultrasound, ozone and other oxidants [140]. 
The combined DBD-plate plasma and suspended-TiO2 photocatalysis 
could significantly increase the mineralization yield as compared to the 
DBD-plate plasma system alone, as reported by Ghezzar et al. [56]. 
Vanraes et al. combined the DBD plasma with the adsorption process on 
activated carbon textile with additional ozonation as post-treatment or 
pretreatment. It was found that the configuration with ozonation, as 
pretreatment, leads to enhanced pesticide removal and shows better 
efficiency than the second configuration (plasma treatment first) [141]. 
Li et al. reported the degradation of organic pollutants coupling 
discharge plasma and in-situ hybrid photocatalytic process. In this 
technique, authors have used discharge plasma to produce active species 
on the TiO 2 surface and also used external UV light to enhance the 
process efficiency [142]. 
It was reported that the treatment of contaminated aqueous solutions 
with a combined corona discharge-ozonation system increased the rate of degradation and also significantly improved the mineralization yield 
as compared to ozonation alone [143]. The combined DBD 
plasma-Activated carbon fibers (ACFs), compared to DBD plasma alone, 
showed an enhanced degradation efficiency and mineralization yield at low pH. This synergistic effect in the presence of ACFs can be explained 
by a high adsorption capacity, stable discharge, and small discharge gap 
[144]. 
The synergetic degradation performance of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) by 
dielectric barrier discharge plasma (DBDP) and persulfate (PS) was 
examined by Shang et al. the addition of persulfate during treatment had 
little effect on the degradation pathways of dye, but significantly 
improved the mineralization, the authors mainly attribute this effect to 
the enhanced production of sulfate radical and hydroxyl radicals pro
-
duced from the activated PS [74]. 
Shang et al. reported the degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) by DBD plasma / Fe2/ persulfate oxidation process. It was found that the ter -
tiary system of plasma/PS/Fe2with an optimal quantity of PS and Fe2
presented higher PNP degradation efficiency for the same time of treatment than discharge plasma alone and the binary systems of 
plasma/PS, plasma/Fe
2and PS/Fe2[145]. 
7. Advantages and drawbacks in discharge plasma for water
treatment
In recent years, extensive attention has been drawn to water treat -
ment using plasma techniques, as it has many advantages such as: 
i)Importantly, no external oxidants are required, and no need to
adjust the temperature and pH of the treated effluents. Therefore, it can 
be discharged directly, or it can be used in the irrigation field [146]. 
ii)High-efficiency process
iii) The reactors used to generate plasma in the gas phase can be used
for water treatment with small modifications, since similar kind of active species are produced in the gas and the liquid phase [147]. 
Indeed, discharge plasmas have several advantages, as mentioned 
above, it also has some drawback such as;  
1)Possible generation of highly toxics degradation by-products [148 ].
2)A decline in the efficiency of increasing concentrations of organic
pollutants and mineral salts [132 ].
3)In some plasma technologies, the price and the high gas consumption
present a severe limitation for a large-scale application [132 ].
8. Plasma treatment in pilot scale
Nowadays, there is still a need to develop systems with pilot or
industrial-scale reactors that have an excellent capacity for resolving a real problem of chemically and biologically contaminated water [149]. 
Such as the system proposed by Fr ohling et al. in the study of the Impact 
of a Pilot-Scale Plasma-Assisted Washing Process on the Culturable 
Microbial Community [150]. The development of the Pilot-Scale Pulsed 
Corona Discharge system by Ajo et al., for the removal of high concen
-
trated pharmaceutical residues gives a reduction of 87% of this last from raw sewage. However, 100% elimination was obtained for wastewater 
treated biologically with less energy consumption [151]. Some re
-
searchers team has proposed the scaling-up of a specific plasma process utilizing a microwave plasma torch, where this system can generate 
antimicrobial active water at a near industrial scale. The process was 
competitive with industrial habitual chemical proceedings [152]. On the 
other hand, this technology has shown high efficacy in the degradation 
of trace organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals at a pilot-scale 
[153], or for the degradation of wide concentration range (~10–10
5 
ng/L) of poly- and perfluoroalkyl species from liquid investigation-derived waste [154]. A supplementary ozone injection in 
pilot scale plasma system for some organic pollutants removal has 
proved to be more efficient [155]. However, the entire investment costs 
and reliability of this reactors at a large-scale are still relatively 
ambiguous. Also, given that molecular ozone oxidation may be the 
dominant mechanism for many pollutants, future studies could provide 
direct comparisons of electrical discharge plasma with traditional ozone 
generators to compare process performance. From another hand, in 
order to enhance its commercial viability for full-scale water and 
wastewater treatment, plasma technology could undergo a long-term 
reliability test on its desired performance durability and normal work
-
ing life as well as operational safety. 
9.Conclusions
In the last years, the demand for the application of electrical
discharge plasma technology for raw water and industrial wastewater 
cleaning has significantly increased. The medium of discharge consid -
erably affects both the reactive species production and the degradation

by the discharge plasma type, the physical state of the contaminated 
solution and its introduction system, the  internal conception, and the 
scale of the reactor. The discharge plasma process can be combined with 
different processes of treatment, and the yield depends on the type of the 
coupled process, the configuration of the two processes in post or pre-
treatment arrangement, and the number of passes. As for all treatment 
techniques, the discharge plasma has many advantages for water 
cleaning but also presents some drawbacks. 
Plasma technologies combined with other processes seem to be 
practical, inexpensive, effective and forward-looking methods for the 
removal of aqueous contaminants at  both laboratory and pilot scales. 
But, looking forward, several challenges remain to be addressed for 
more research and development in order to satisfy consumer demand. 
Future use of plasma discharge for water treatment will primarily 
depend on its efficacy and energy consumption relative to other 
advanced oxidation process and treatment methods in general, but 
certain requirements must also be taken into account. Sustainability, 
ease of use, capital and operating costs, gas supply will all decide when 
the device can be implemented on a wide scale. In addition, a thorough 
analysis of the produced oxidation by-products and long-lived oxidants 
in treated water is required to ensure that total toxicity is continuously 
and adequately decreased after treatment. 
The novelty of this study " Review on Plasma discharge for water 
treatment: mechanism, reactor geometries, active species and combined 
processes ” 
This manuscript presents a review on a serious environmental 
problem (contamination of the water). 
In our knowledge, paper on plasma reactors configurations and ac-
tives species for water remediation presents a new review for Journal of 
Water Process Engineering readers. 
These summarize of findings (over more than 150 ref) would 
certainly be of great interest to the readership of Journal of Water 
Process Engineering for advancing in their investigation about 
nonthermal plasma for environmental applications.
