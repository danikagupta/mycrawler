Currently, there is increasing interest in assessing the potential of bacterial laccases for industrial and
environmental applications especially in harsh conditions. The environmental impact of the textile indus-
try requires novel and effective technologies to mitigate the presence of dyes in wastewaters before dis-
charging into the environment. Dyes usually remain stable in the presence of a variety of chemicals, lightand are recalcitrant to microbial degradation. Among available technologies the biological treatments
offer environmentally friendly strategies for decolorizing and detoxifying these compounds. The recent
discovery of versatile laccases in streptomycetes opens up new opportunities for their commercial appli-cation. The aim of this study is to assess the potential of a novel bacterial laccase SilA produced byStreptomyces ipomoeae CECT 3341 active over wide temperature and pH ranges for use as an eco-
friendly, biological treatment for the degradation of textile dyes. Insights into the enhancement of the
oxidative action of this enzyme through the use of natural redox mediators are presented together withan assessment of the potential toxicity of the degradation products. Our results conﬁrm that the combi-
nation of the laccase and natural mediators such as acetosyringone and methyl syringate enhanced the
decolorization and detoxiﬁcation of a variety of textile dyes up to sixfold and 20-fold, respectively.Mediator concentration was found to have a signiﬁcant effect (p < 0.05) on dye decolorization at 60 /C176C;
thus, the decolorization of Acid Orange 63 increased from 6 to 70-fold when the mediator concentration
was increased from 0.1 to 0.5 mM. Further, the toxicity of tartrazine decreased 36-fold when the SilA-MeS system was used to decolorize the dye. The thermal properties of the SilA coupled with the stabilityof SilA at high pH suggest a potential commercial application for use in the decolorization of textile
wastewaters which generally are performed at high temperature (>55 /C176C) and salinity and neutral pH,
conditions which are unfavourable for conventional fungal laccases./C2112018 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University. This is an

1. Introduction
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are a part of a larger group of enzymes
called multi-copper enzymes which contain four copper atoms in
the catalytic centre, structured in three different cupredoxine-type domains. Laccases are widely distributed in nature and have
been described in fungi, plants, insects, bacteria and archaea
(Uthandi et al., 2010 ). The biological role of fungal and plant lac-
cases has been exhaustively studied and shown to be related to
the degradation and synthesis of lignin, respectively ( Riva, 2006 ).
It has been suggested that bacterial laccases are involved in mor-
phogenesis, biosynthesis of spore pigments, copper homeostasis
and lignin solubilisation ( Roberts et al., 2002, Arias et al., 2016 ).
Laccases cause a mono-electronic oxidation of a broad group of
phenolic compounds coupled to the 4e/C0reduction of O 2to H 2O. In
some cases, the capacity of laccases to oxidize a substrate is hin-
dered by the non-phenolic nature of the compounds or their high
redox potential. The redox potential of laccases spans widely, from

400 mV for plant and bacterial laccases to 790 mV estimated for
fungal laccases ( Gutiérrez et al., 2006; Mikolasch and Schauer,
2009 ). The low substrate speciﬁcity, the lack of cofactors and the
ready availability of oxygen as an electron acceptor, makes laccases
promising and versatile enzymes with application in a number of
biotechnological processes ( Riva, 2006 ). The list of potential appli-
cations include biobleaching and pulp deligniﬁcation, decolourisa-
tion and detoxiﬁcation of dyes ( Arias et al., 2003; Molina-Guijarro
et al., 2009; Moya et al., 2010 ), food processing ( Minussi et al.,
2002 ), bioremediation and biosensor and biofuel cell construction
(Amir et al., 2009; Brijwani et al., 2010 ).
In addition, there is the possibility of expanding laccases oxida-
tion range through the use of redox mediators; this extending the
biotechnological potential of the enzymes. The redox mediators act
as electron shuttles and provide an indirect oxidation step. Theoxidized radical form of the mediator is able to oxidize a wide
range of large molecules and non-phenolic substrates. ABTS (2,2
0-
azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) was the ﬁrst
artiﬁcial mediator used in the laccase-mediator systems (LMS)
(Bourbonnais and Paice, 1990 ). Other synthetic mediators such as
1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) and the oxime violuric acid (VLA)
have also demonstrated their ability to oxidize recalcitrant aro-
matic compounds ( Cañas and Camarero, 2010 ). However, because
of the toxicity and cost associated with the use of these synthetic
mediator compounds there is an urgent need to ﬁnd more suitable
natural compounds, capable of acting as mediators to laccases. Fur-
thermore, currently this is a key limitation to the commercial
application of laccases. Previous research has reported that pheno-
lic compounds related to lignin have shown their capability and
efﬁciency to act as natural laccase mediators ( Camarero et al.,
2005 ). However, additional work is required to further assess the
potential commercial use of mediators to laccases.
The textile and paper industries manufacture thousands of dif-
ferent dyes which must remain stable in the presence of a variety
of chemicals, light exposure and microbial degradation. Currently
there are over 10,000 synthetic dyes being used worldwide.
Because of this inherent recalcitrance, 90% of reactive textile dyes
remain in the sewage plants and ultimately discharged into rivers.
A number of speciﬁc combined oxic and anoxic treatment pro-
cesses have been developed capable of degrading recalcitrant dyes.
However, the generation of carcinogenic amines from azo dyes in
anoxic processes poses a serious health hazard. The application
of laccases to the textile and paper industries is therefore particu-
larly important. Fungal and bacterial laccases have also been
shown to effectively decolorize and degrade synthetic dyes
(Abadulla et al., 2000; Molina-Guijarro et al., 2009; Pereira et al.,
2009; Moya et al., 2010; Mendes et al., 2011; Saratale et al.,
2011; Forootanfar et al., 2012; Asgher et al., 2013 ) as well as ﬂex-
ographic inks ( Fillat et al., 2012 ). However, currently the commer-
cial application of fungal laccases for the removal of dyes from
wastewaters is limited mainly due to the relatively slow growth
of the fungi and the requirement for a controlled source of nitrogen
(Anastasi et al., 2011 ). Bacterial laccases have a greater commercial
potential compared with fungal systems mainly in extreme envi-
ronments ( Sharma et al., 2007 ).
In this work we screen the potential of bacterial laccases for the
decolorization and degradation of textile dyes. Molecular and
physicochemical characterization of the recombinant laccase (SilA)
from Streptomyces ipomoeae CECT 3341 is presented, together with
an assessment of its effectiveness in decolorizing and detoxifying
commercial dyes. The aim of this study is to assess the commercial
potential of this novel bacterial laccase as an eco-friendly, biologi-
cal treatment for the degradation of industrial textile dyes. Insights
into the mechanism of action of this enzyme are also presented
together with an assessment of the toxicity of the degradation
products.2. Materials and methods
2.1. Enzyme production and puriﬁcation
A recombinant laccase (SilA) of Streptomyces ipomoeae CECT
3341 was obtained as previously described ( Molina-Guijarro
et al., 2009 ). For the production of SilA, 2 litres of Luria-Bertani
(LB) liquid medium containing 50 mgm L/C01kanamycin was inocu-
lated with 40 mL of a pre-inoculum of E. coli BL21 (DE3) trans-
formed with a pET28 plasmid containing the codifying gene of
SilA. After growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 /C176C
for 10 min at 12,000 g, and the pellet washed twice with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS). To obtain the recombinant protein, cells were
suspended in chilled 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) and com-
pletely disrupted with a French press (Sim-Aminco) after three
passes at 1500 psi. The insoluble fraction was discarded after cen-
trifugation (10 min at 15,000 gat 4/C176C), and the soluble fraction con-
taining the protein was collected. To activate the enzyme, this
fraction was incubated for 3 h on ice with 1 mM CuSO 4, and then
dialyzed at 4 /C176C overnight against 5 litres of 10 mM phosphate buf-
fer (pH 7). The active SilA was stored at /C020/C176C until its puriﬁcation.
The recombinant laccase was puriﬁed chromatographically
using a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) due to the presence
of His-tag residue from the pET plasmid. The column was equili-
brated with 20 mM phosphate buffer, 0.5 M NaCl, and 10 mM imi-
dazole (pH 7.4). Prior to loading on the column, the samples were
mixed with an equal volume of the mobile phase (2-fold concen-
trated). The protein was eluted with the same buffer amended with
750 mM imidazole. Active fractions were dialyzed against PBS buf-
fer in a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) to remove imida-
zole ( Molina-Guijarro et al., 2009 )
Laccase activity was routinely determined at room temperature
by measuring the oxidation of 5 mM 2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo
thiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH
4.5) and 5 mM 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) in 100 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 8). The increase in the absorbance at 436 nm for ABTS
and 469 nm for 2,6-DMP were monitored using a Hitachi 2001
spectrophotometer, using a molar extinction coefﬁcient of
29,300 M/C01cm/C01for oxidized ABTS and 27,500 M/C01cm/C01for oxi-
dized 2,6-DMP ( Arias et al., 2003 ).
2.2. Enzyme stability assays
Thermodynamic stability was assessed by steady-state ﬂuores-
cence measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse spectroﬂuorometer
using wavelengths of 280 nm and 296 nm for excitation and 340
nm for emission. Samples containing protein (Abs296 = 0.1) in
phosphate buffer, pH 7 were placed onto a thermostatically con-
trolled thermal block and heated at a rate of 1 /C176C/min up to 100 /C176C.
For chemical stability studies, increased guanidinium hydrochloride
(GdnHCl) concentrations were used to induce protein unfolding,
monitored through a combination of ﬂuorescence intensity and
emission maximum as previously described ( Durão et al., 2006 ).
Kinetic stability studies were performed by incubating the
enzyme at 95 /C176C in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7. At ﬁxed time
intervals sample aliquots were taken for activity at 25 /C176C. All assays
were performed in triplicate. Enzyme activity was assayed using
the ABTS substrate solution and the protein content was deter-
mined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a
standard.
2.3. Redox titration
Redox titration was performed at 25 /C176C and pH 7, in anaerobic
conditions under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture914 A. Blánquez et al. / Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 26 (2019) 913–920contained 35 mM enzyme in phosphate buffer pH 7 and the follow-
ing mediators: 10 mM ﬁnal concentration of dimethyl- p-
phenylenediamine (+344 mV), sodium ferrocyanide (+433 mV),
monocarboxylic acid ferrocene (+530 mV), 1,10-dicarboxylic acid
ferrocene (+644 mV) and Fe (II/III) tris-(1,10-phenantroline)
(+1070 mV). Potassium hexachloroiridate (IV) was used as oxidant
and sodium dithionite as reductant. The redox potential was mon-
itored by visible spectroscopy (300–700 nm) using a Shimadzu UV-
1603 spectrophotometer with a combined silver/silver chloride
electrode and calibrated with a quinhydrone saturated solution
at pH 7.0. The redox potentials are quoted against the standard
hydrogen electrode.
2.4. Dye decolorization with laccase and laccase-mediator system
All dyes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with the highest
grade available. Table 1 lists the dyes used in this study, together
with their chemical structure, their molar extinction coefﬁcient
at pH 8 and the maximal absorption wavelength.
The natural compounds used as mediators were 3,5-dimethoxy-
4-hydroxyacetophenone (acetosyringone, AS), 3,5-dimethoxy-4-h
ydroxybenzaldehyde (syringaldehyde, SA) purchased from
Sigma–Aldrich and methyl 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoate
(methyl syringate, MeS) purchased from Novozymes.
To evaluate the ability of puriﬁed recombinant laccase SilA to
decolorize the selected dyes reaction mixtures containing 0.4 U
laccase mL/C01and 50 mM of each dye were incubated in 50 mM
phosphate buffer pH 8 for 24 h at 35 /C176C. Decolorization was moni-
tored by measuring the absorbance at the maximum absorption
visible wavelength of each dye in a Shimadzu UV-160A spec-
trophotometer. To increase the oxidative potential of the enzyme,
the phenolic compounds derived from lignin structure acetosy-ringone, syringaldehyde and methyl syringate were assayed as
mediators together with laccase in decolorization experiments.
For this purpose, different conditions were used. Two different
concentrations of each mediator (0.1 and 0.5 mM) were tested
together with 0.4 U laccase mL
/C01and 50 mM of Acid Orange 63
and tartrazine at two different temperatures (35 and 60 /C176C). Decol-
orization was determined by the decrease in the absorbance at 418
and 425 nm for Acid Orange 63 and tartrazine respectively, com-
pared with controls. Experiments were carried out in triplicate
and heat inactivated laccase was used in control reactions.
2.5. Assessment of toxicity of dyes, degradation intermediates and
products
Toxicity was carried out using a Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata
test, performed according to OECD Guideline No. 201 ( OECD,
1984b ), using the Algaltoxkit FTM (Microbiotests, BE). Algal
inocula were prepared by incubation of stock cells at 24 ± 1 /C176Ci n
uniform illumination conditions (10,000 lux for sideway illumina-
tion or minimum 3000–4000 lux for bottom illumination) until an
algal density of 1 /C2106cells mL/C01was reached. A dilution series of
each dye as well as of the samples obtained after 24 h enzyme
treatment from 50 to 3.125 mM were prepared and then each dilu-
tion was inoculated with the algal suspension to obtain 1 /C2104
cells mL/C01. Tests were performed with the same previous temper-
ature and illumination conditions for 72 h, in 25 mL ﬂasks, with
daily determination of algal growth using absorbance values
related to a standard curve supplied by Microbiotests BE.
The EC50 (72 h) values for the algal reference test were calcu-
lated according to the procedure outlined in OECD Guideline 201
(ISO 8692) for the estimation of growth rates. All toxicity assays
were carried out in triplicate and toxicity degree was calculated
as (1/EC 50)x100.2.6. Statistical analysis
Decolorization by the different enzymatic treatments over time
was statistically analysed using repeated measure ANOVA imple-
mented in Statistica v8.0 software. Mediators (AS, SA and MeS),
mediator concentration (0.1 and 0.5 mM) and temperature (35
and 60 /C176C) were included as ﬁxed factors.
3. Results
3.1. Decolorization studies and toxicity determination
All assays carried out with SilA in the absence of mediator
showed a low decolorization rate (15–30%) ( Table 2 ). Further, SilA
was ineffective in the decolorization of Acid Black 48, Acid Orange
63, Reactive Black 5 and Azure B dyes. However, the addition of the
redox mediators resulted in a signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) increase in
activity. The addition of acetosyringone (AS) resulted in an increase
(average 7-fold) in decolorization after 24 h of incubation of all the
dyes compared to SilA degradation treatments without the addi-
tion of AS as mediator. Similarly, the addition of syringaldehyde
(SA) and methyl syringate (MeS) as mediators resulted in a 4–6-
fold increase respectively in decolorization compared to those
observed with the enzyme. In all three treatments the dyes show-
ing the highest decolorization were Reactive Black 5 (RB5), Orange
II (OII) and Indigo carmine (IC).
In previous studies SilA was shown to exhibit moderate ther-
mostability retaining more than 50% activity at 60 /C176C after 24 h.
As many textile dye wastewaters usually have a high temperature
(>55 /C176C), the ability of the enzyme and mediator to degrade dyes
at higher temperatures was assessed. For this purpose, two of the
previous dyes, tartrazine (TART) and Acid Orange 63 (AO63) were
incubated under the same conditions but at 60 /C176C, the optimum
temperature of SilA. Incubation at this temperature resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase in dye decolorization [F(1,48) = 44.447,
p < 0.05, Fig. 1 A] regardless the mediator used. In the Fig. 1 Bi s
shown that MeS was the most efﬁcient mediator [F(2, 48) = 17.851,
p < 0.05] at both temperatures tested ( Fig. 1 B). In order to optimize
the degradation yields of the SilA-mediator system, higher concen-
tration of the mediators (0.5 mM) was tested with the two selected
dyes, AO63 and TART, at 35 and 60 /C176C. The mediator concentration
was found to have a signiﬁcant effect [F(1, 48) = 3137.2, p < 0.05] on
dye decolorization ( Fig. 1 C) resulting in a 3.5-fold increase in decol-
orization for both dyes at any temperature. The interaction of medi-
ator concentration-temperature resulted in a signiﬁcant effect
[F(1, 48) = 66.119, p < 0.05]. The loss of colour in a reaction indi-
cates breakdown of the parent compound. However, it is possiblethat the breakdown products, although colourless, may still remain
hazardous in terms of ecological impact. This point is often over-
looked in dye degradation studies. Therefore, ecotoxicity assays
were performed with Acid Orange 63 and tartrazine reaction mix-
tures before and after SilA-mediator treatments. This was assessed
using Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata as a bioindicator .The toxicity
degree of AO63 and TART at an initial concentration of 50 mM with
0.1 mM AS or MeS, prior to the enzyme treatment was between 5
and 18% ( Fig. 2 , black columns). The toxicity of the dyes was higher
in the presence of methyl syringate as mediator, presumably due to
the toxicity of the mediator. The toxicity degree following enzyme
treatment at 35 /C176C decreased 10-fold, when MeS was used as medi-
ator; however, the toxicity in the treatments with AS at the same
temperature decreased 3-fold ( Fig. 2 , white columns). At the higher
temperature, 60 /C176C, a 36-fold decrease in the toxicity degree of
TART was observed with MeS ( Fig. 2 , striped column). The toxicity
degree for TART with AS and for AO63 with AS and MeS at 60 /C176C
decreased around 1.5–10-fold ( Fig. 2 , striped columns).A. Blánquez et al. / Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 26 (2019) 913–920 9153.2. SilA stability assays
The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the laccase
represents important properties for any commercial process butparticularly for those involving exposure to dye-containing
wastewaters at elevated temperatures. The thermodynamic stabil-
ity of the laccase, studied by probing the tertiary structure (ﬂuores-
cence intensity) at increasing temperature or in the presence of theTable 1

the enzyme induced by either temperature or GdnHCl is appar-
ently described by two-state process where the folded and
unfolded states seem to be the only states that accumulate in sig-
niﬁcant amounts. The laccase represents a moderately ther-
mostable enzyme with a melting temperature (T m, where 50% of
the protein molecules were denaturated) of 60 ± 6 /C176C, aDHTm of
44 ± 4 kcal/mol and DSTm of 0.13 ± 0.01 kcal/mol K. During chem-
ical unfolding the tertiary structure of the laccase unfolded with a
mid-point (GdnHCl concentration where 50% of the protein mole-
cules were unfolded) of around 2.2 M. Further, the native state was
more stable than the unfolded state by 2.8 kcal/mol at 25 /C176C.
In order to quantify the irreversible loss of laccase activity dur-
ing incubation at a certain temperature, caused by aggregation or
precipitation processes, a kinetic or long-term stability assay was
carried out. As seen in Fig. 4 the SilA laccase was found to be ther-
mostable showing a half-life value at 95 /C176C of 1.3 h.
3.3. Redox titration
One of the putative problems in the degradation processes
using bacterial lacasses is the low redox potential of these enzymes
as compared to their fungal counterparts. In order to assess the
commercial potential application of the SilA laccase in the decol-
orization of textile dyes the midpoint reduction potential (E00) at
the T1 site of SilA was determined. The reduction of the T1 copper
ion was monitored spectroscopically from 300 to 700 nm. The mid-
point potential obtained by the application of the Nernst equation
was estimated at 337 mV ( Fig. 5 ).
4. Discussion
Each year, around 3 /C2105tonnes of textile dyes are discharged
into wastewaters worldwide ( Ogugbue and Sawidis, 2011 ). These
wastewaters have negative impacts on the environment, not only
by tanning waters but also by direct toxicity and mutagenic capac-ity (Singh et al., 2015 ). A wide range of different physico-chemical
processes has been used for the degradation and decolorization of
these dyes. However, these approaches are expensive and produce
high amounts of waste sludge, which also represents a serious
environmental hazard. In contrast sustainable, biological treat-
ments are promising alternative strategies due to their low cost
and eco-friendly nature ( Chen, 2006 ).
Laccase SilA produced by Streptomyces ipomoeae shows activity
even at high concentrations of sodium chloride and over a broad
pH range ( Molina-Guijarro et al., 2009 ). As the pH of most textile
wastewaters is neutral to alkaline pH, the stability of SilA at high
pH could be advantageous; fungal laccases are not generally active
in alkaline conditions.
When examining the potential of SilA to degrade and detoxify
several textile dyes belonging to different groups ( i.e.anthraqui-
none, diazo, azo, heterocyclic, triarylmethane and indigo), SilA
was not able to directly oxidize Acid Black 48, Acid Orange 63
and Azure B dyes. This ﬁnding could be attributed to the low redoxpotential of the enzyme or to the chemical structure of the dyes,
which is also considered an important point when assessing the
efﬁciency of decolorization. The structural heterogeneity of the
dyes affects the charge density distribution resulting in a lower
or higher redox potential ( Ciullini et al., 2008 ). In general, textile
dyes with simpler structures and low molecular weight presented
higher decolorization yields. The other key factor was the relation-ship between the redox potential of the laccase and the energy
required to withdraw an electron from a reduced substrate. Lac-
cases with high redox potentials are able to readily oxidize a wide
range of substrates; bacterial laccases possess low and medium
redox potentials (SilA 337 mV) restricting their oxidative ability
to a limited group of compounds, as demonstrated in this study.
Molina-Guijarro et al. (2009) previously reported the inability
of SilA to decolorize the azo-dye Orange II. Similar results were
obtained with puriﬁed laccase from Trametes versicolor
(Forootanfar et al., 2012 ) and a recombinant laccase from Strepto-
myces cyaneus (Moya et al., 2010 ) in the decolorization of synthetic
dyes; neither processes were shown to be effective, highlighting
the difﬁculty in ﬁnding effective biological treatments. The use of
phenolic lignin-related compounds, to act as an electron shuttle
between the enzyme and the dyes, opens up new possibilities for
the developing cost-effective biological treatment for textile dyes.
The presence of an oxidized phenolic redox mediator can extend
the range of substrates capable of being degraded by SilA, including
compounds with a high redox and/or non-phenolic compounds.
Previous studies have reported that acetosyringone is an effective
redox mediator in the decolorization of textile dyes ( Camarero
et al., 2005 ). In this study higher decolorization was observed in
the presence of, not only acetosyringone, but also methyl syrin-
gate. In fact, methyl syringate was the most efﬁcient natural medi-
ator in all conditions tested. These results are in line with a
previous study where methyl syringate was observed to be the
most efﬁcient mediator for oxidation of non-phenolic lignin unit’s
(Rosado et al., 2012 ). This was explained by the stability of the phe-
noxy radicals generated by the three phenolic compounds oxida-
tion (MeS > AS > SA), related to the presence of electron donor
groups at the para -position. The oxidation of MeS bearing the
weakest acceptor group at the para -position gives origin to the
most stable phenoxy radical. This fact could explain the efﬁciencyof methyl syringate and acetosyringone as redox mediators to
degrade and decolorize all the textile dyes studied in the present
work. It was also observed that high decolorization was achieved
with higher mediator concentrations, indicating that the reactive
species originated by the mediator’s oxidation are involved in com-
petitive routes, i.e. coupling reactions that lead to the formation of
dimeric and trimeric structures ( Rosado et al., 2012 ).
It is also important to consider that degradation of textile dyes
lead not only to decolorization but also to detoxiﬁcation. Many of
the dyes used in the textile industry can be toxic and/or mutagenic
(Dos Santos et al., 2007 ). More than 90% of the 4000 dyes studied
by ETAD (Ecological and Toxicological Association of the Dyestuffs
Manufacturing Industr y) showed high toxicity rates ( Robinson

pounds of increased toxicity ( Zaharia and Suteu, 2012 ). In this
work the SilA-acetosyringone system was able not only to degrade
the azo dyes under study but also to detoxify them at alkaline pH.
It is also remarkable that this laccase-natural mediator system is
able to decolorize and detoxify a wide range of dyes.
The high levels of decolorization observed from this SilA
laccase-mediator system at neutral to alkaline pH range and at
high temperatures (60 /C176C) is advantageous for dye-containing
wastewater treatments, since most fungal laccases are only active
in acid conditions and at mesophilic temperatures ( Nyanhongo
et al., 2002; Kokol et al., 2007 ). When proteins are exposed to

or enzymatic activity occurs. The thermal stability of an enzyme is
a key factor when assessing the commercial feasibility of an
emerging biotechnology developed to treat high temperature
wastes. Long-term stability or kinetic stability, generally expressed
as the enzyme’s half-life at a particular temperature, depends on
the energy barrier to irreversible inactivation. Previous studies car-
ried out with recombinant laccase SilA showed its capability to
retain more than 50% activity after 24 h at 50 and 60 /C176C(Molina-
Guijarro et al., 2009 ). SilA remains active at 95 /C176C with a half-life
of 1.3 h. Other thermostable bacterial laccases, such as the CotA
laccase have been reported to show a similar thermal stability,
with a half-life of 2.9 h at 80 /C176C(Durão et al., 2006 ). These values
contrast with others for some fungal laccases from Myceliophthora
thermophila and Scytalidium thermophilum which were unable to
withstand 1 h at 80 /C176C(Chefetz et al., 1998 ). Among fungal lac-
cases, Pycnoporus sanguineus produces a thermostable laccase with
a half-life of 2.8 h at 75 /C176C(Litthauer et al., 2007 ); however, this
laccase is only effective under acidic conditions, not under the con-
ditions common in dye wastewaters.
5. Conclusions
One of the main bottlenecks that must be overcome in order to
use laccases for biotechnological and environmental applications is
their loss of effectiveness under extreme conditions. The heterolo-
gous production of SilA using E. coli as host, its stability to high
temperatures, alkaline pH and high salt-resistance, together with
the possibility to enhance its oxidative action through the use of
natural mediators, makes this enzyme a good candidate for biore-
mediation applications. Removal of dyes from wastewaters usinglaccases and laccase-mediator systems represent a potentially
commercially viable, effective and environmentally friendly alter-
native to traditional physicochemical methods which require a
high energy and investment.
