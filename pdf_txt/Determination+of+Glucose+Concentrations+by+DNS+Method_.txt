 Laboratory Analytical Procedure  
 
1. Introduction   
1.1 The following method describes a procedur e for measurement of cellulase activity 
using International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) guidelines (1).  
The procedure has been designed to measure cellulase activity in terms of "filter-paper units" (FPU) per
 milliliter  of original  (undiluted)  enzyme  solution .  For 
quantitative results the enzyme preparations must be compared on the basis of significant and equal conversion.  The value of 2.0 mg of reducing sugar as glucose from 50 mg of filter paper (4% conversion) in 60 minutes has been designated as the intercept for calculating filter paper cellulase units (FPU) by IUPAC.   
1.2 It is extremely important to keep in mind that the FPU is defined only at this extent 
of conversion.  Reducing sugar yield is not  a linear function of the quantity of 
enzyme in the assay mixture; as discu ssed by Ghose (1987), twice the amount of 
enzyme would not
 be expected to yield twice the reducing sugar in equal time.  The 
assay procedure therefore involves finding a dilution of the original enzyme stock 
such that a 0.5 mL aliquot of the diluti on will catalyze 4% conversion in 60 minutes 
(or, in practical terms, finding two dilutions that bracket the 4%-conversion point so closely that the required dilution can be obtained, with reasonable accuracy, by 
interpolation) and then calculating the activity  (in FPU/mL) of the original stock from the dilution required.  Further comme nts on the required calculations, and 
their significance, are to be found in the Appendix. 
1.3 Assay mixtures may in some cases contain reducing sugars unrelated to hydrolysis 
of substrate glycosidic bonds by the enzyme.  Culture filtrates to be assayed for cellulase may contain nutrient sugars, a nd the reducing ends of the cellulose 
polymers of the substrate may sometimes be measurable as glucose equivalents before any enzyme attack.  For this reason, controls consisting of (a) enzyme without substrate and b) substrate without  enzyme are included with all enzyme 
assays and sample values are corrected for any blank values.   
 
2. Scope   
2.1 This procedure is only appropriate for the determination of FPU activity in a 
cellulase preparation as defined by the IUPAC procedure as outlined above.

4. Significance and Use    24.1 This procedure follows IUPAC guidelines and determines enzyme activity as filter 
paper units in a cellulase preparation. 
 
5. Apparatus  
5.1 Water bath capable of maintaining 50oC ± 0.1oC. 
5.2 Spectrophotometer suitable for measuring absorbance at 540 nm. 
 
6. Reagents and Materials  
6.1 DNS Reagent 
Mix: Distilled water    1416 mL        3,5 Dinitrosalicylic acid    10.6 g        Sodium hydroxide     19.8 g 
 
Dissolve above, then add: 
Rochelle salts (sodium potassium tartrate) 306 g 
Phenol (melt at 50
oC)    7.6 mL 
Sodium metabisulfite    8.3 g 
 
Titrate 3 mL sample with 0.1 N HCl to the phenolphthalein endpoint.  It should take 5-6 mL of HCl.  Add NaOH if required (2 g = 1 mL 0.1 N HCL). 
 
6.2 Citrate Buffer :  For Trichoderma reesei , cellulase assays are carried out in 0.05 M 
citrate buffer pH 4.8.  For other cellula se enzymes, the pH and the assay 
temperature may be different.  The assay conditions must be defined when reporting results. 
 
Citric acid monohydrate   210  g DI water     750  mL NaOH - add until pH equals 4.3  50 to 60 g 
Dilute to 1 L and check pH.  If necessary add NaOH until the pH is 4.5. When the 1 M stock citrate buffer stock is diluted with water to 50 mM the pH should be 4.8.  After diluting the citrate buffer check and adjust the pH if necessary to pH 4.8. 
 
7. ES&H Considerations and Hazards 
7.1 Follow all applicable NREL Laboratory Specific Hygiene Plan guidelines. 
7.2 Care must be taken when working w ith phenol, which is toxic and corrosive. 
 
8. Procedure for the Filter Paper Assay for Saccharifying Cellulase   
8.1 The detection of glycosidic bond cleavage by this method involves the parallel and 
identical treatment of three categories of experimental tubes (assay mixtures, blanks 
and controls, and glucose standards), prepared  as detailed below.  The substrate is a 
50 mg Whatman No. 1 filter paper strip (1.0 x 6.0 cm). 
8.2 Enzyme assay tubes: 
8.2.1 Place a rolled filter paper strip into each 13 x 100 test tube.  38.2.2 Add 1.0 mL 0.05 M Na-citrate, pH 4.8 to the tube; the buffer should 
saturate the filter paper strip. 
8.2.3 Equilibrate tubes with buffer and substrate to 50oC. 
8.2.4 Add 0.5 mL enzyme diluted appropriatel y in citrate buffer.  At least two 
dilutions must be made of each enzyme sample, with one dilution 
releasing slightly more than 2.0 mg of glucose (absolute amount) and one 
slightly less than 2.0 mg of glucose.  Target 2.1 and 1.9 mg glucose, respectively, for these two dilutions.  Depending on the enzyme these targets may be hard to achieve a nd additional dilutions must be run. 
8.2.5 Incubate at 50
oC for exactly 60 min. 
8.2.6 At the end of the incubation period, remove each assay tube from the 50oC 
bath and stop the enzyme reaction by immediately adding 3.0 mL DNS 
reagent and mixing. 
8.3 Blank and controls: 
8.3.1 Reagent blank:  1.5 mL citrate buffer. 8.3.2 Enzyme control: 1.0 mL citrate buffer + 0.5 mL enzyme dilution (prepare 
a separate control for each dilution tested). 
8.3.3 Substrate control: 1.5 mL citr ate buffer + filter-paper strip. 
8.4 Glucose standards: 
8.4.1 A working stock solution of anhydrous glucose (10 mg/mL) should be 
made up.  Aliquots of this working stock should be tightly sealed and stored frozen. The standard should be  vortexed after thawing to ensure 
adequate mixing. 
8.4.2 Dilutions are made from the working stock in the following manner: 
1.0 mL + 0.5 mL buffer = 1:1.5 = 6.7 mg/mL (3.35 mg/0.5 mL). 1.0 mL + 1.0 mL buffer = 1:2 = 5 mg/mL (2.5 mg/0.5 mL). 1.0 mL + 2.0 mL buffer = 1:3 = 3.3 mg/mL (1.65 mg/0.5 mL). 1.0 mL + 4.0 mL buffer = 1:5 = 2 mg/mL (1.0 mg/0.5 mL). 
8.4.3 Glucose standard tubes should be prepared by adding 0.5 mL of each of 
the above glucose dilutions to 1.0 mL of citrate buffer in a 13 x 100 mm test tube. 
8.4.4 Blanks, controls and glucose st andards should be incubated at 50
oC along 
with the enzyme assay tubes, and then  "stopped" at the end of 60 minutes 
by addition of 3.0 mL of DNS reagent. 
8.5 Color development (Miller, 1959): 
8.5.1 Boil all tubes for exactly 5.0 minutes in a vigorously boiling water bath 
containing sufficient water to cover th e portions of the tubes occupied by 
the reaction mixture plus reagent.  All samples, controls, blanks, and glucose standards should be boiled toge ther.  After boiling, transfer to a 
cold ice-water bath. 
8.5.2 Let the tubes sit until all the pulp has se ttled, or centrifuge briefly.  Dilute 
all tubes (assays, blanks , standards and controls ) in water (0.200 mL of 
color-developed reaction mixture plus 2.5 mL of water in a spectrophotometer cuvette works well, use the pipettor to mix by drawing the mixture into the pipettor tip repeatedly).  Determine color formation by measuring absorbance against the reagent blank at 540 nm.  With this dilution the glucose standards descri bed above should give absorbance in 
the range of 0.1 to 1.0 A.  
9. Calculations   
9.1 Construct a linear glucose standard curv e using the absolute amounts of glucose 
(mg/0.5 mL) plotted against A 540.  The data for the standard curve should closely fit 
a calculated straight line, with the correlation coefficient for this straight line fit 
being very near to one.  Verify the standard curve by running a calibration verification standard, an i ndependently prepared solution of containing a known 
amount of glucose which falls about midpoint on the standard curve. 
9.2 Using this standard curve determine the am ount of glucose released for each sample 
tube after subtraction of enzyme blank. 
9.3 Estimate the concentration of enzyme whic h would have released exactly 2.0 mg of 
glucose by means of a plot of glucose liberated against the logarithm of enzyme concentration (refer to the example in Appendix B, which uses semilogarithmic graph paper).  To find the required enzyme concentration take two data points that 
are very close to 2.0 mg and draw a straight line between them, use this line to interpolate between the two points to find  the enzyme dilution that would produce 
exactly 2.0 mg glucose equivalents of redu cing sugar.  Appendix B presents an 
example. 
 
Note: In this plot, and in the equation below for calculating FPU, the term "enzyme concentration"  refers to the proportion of the original enzyme 
solution present in each enzyme dilution (i.e., the number of mL of the original solution present in each mL of the dilution). 
 9.4 Calculate FPU: 
units/ml  glucose  mg  2.0  releasing [enzyme] 0.37= Activity  Paper  Filter  
 
Where [enzyme] represents the proportion of original enzyme solution present in the directly tested enzyme dilution (that dilution of which 0.5 mL is added to the 
assay mixture).  For the derivation of th e FPU see Ghose (1987) and Appendix A. 
 
9.5 Refer to Appendix B for an example for calculating IUPAC-FPU.  
 
 4 510. Precision and Bias 
10.1 Precision can be measured only by the clos eness of repeated measurements of the 
same quantity of enzyme.  This procedur e, if carefully followed, should give the 
same approximate numerical readings as obtained by other laboratories using the 
same procedure.  Precision in filter paper assays may be affected by the inherent 
physical properties of cellulase preparations. 
 
11. Quality Control  
11.1 Reported significant figures:   Typically results are reported as whole integers along 
with the standard deviation.  The assay conditions must be defined when reporting 
the results. 
11.2 Replicates:   Run each dilution in triplicate. 
11.3 Blank:   As described in the section “Blank and controls”. 
11.4 Relative percent difference criteria:  Not defined; dependent on the enzyme being 
tested. 
11.5 Method verification standard:   Not available since enzymes change over time. 
11.6 Calibration verification standard:  A calibration verification standard shall be 
independently prepared and analyzed as described in the section “Calculations”. 
11.7 Sample size:   Dependant upon enzyme concentration. 
11.8 Sample storage:  Dependant upon source of enzyme.  Manufacturer’s instructions should be followed. 
11.9 Standard storage:   Store frozen at -20
oC or prepare fresh batch; shake vigorously 
prior to use. 
11.10 Standard preparation:   As described in the section “Glucose standards”. 
11.11 Definition of a batch : Run all standards, blanks, and samples together in one batch.  
The size of the batch may be limited by instrument constraints and should not be larger than what is practical to handle together. 
11.12 Control charts:   Not applicable. 
11.13 Others:   Not applicable. 
 
12. Appendix A:  Numerical Values in Equation Used to Calculate Filter Paper Activity 
The practical bottom line is that if the assays are set up according to the instructions, and the 
calculations are carried out using the equation pr esented in the calculations section, the results 
obtained will correspond to the generally accepted activities in "filter paper units" that would be 
obtained by other laboratories around the world, were  these other laboratories to test the same 
enzyme solution.  For those workers interested in the derivation of this equation, and of the 
"filter paper unit", the following comments may be helpful in conjunction with Ghose (1987).  The numerator (0.37) in the equation is derived from the factor for converting the 2.0 mg of 
"glucose-equivalents" gene rated in the assay to mmoles of glucose (2.0 ÷ 0.18016), from the 
volume of the enzyme being tested that is used in the assay (0.5 mL), and from the incubation 
time (60 minutes) required for generation of the reducing equivalents.  Thus, mL - minute mol/  0.37  =  minutes)  60  x  dilution  enzyme  mL  (0.5mol) glucose/  mg  0.18016  /  glucose  mg  (2.0μμ 
Because the "enzyme concentration" in the denominator  of the equation is a dimensionless 
number (equal to the ratio of the enzyme concentration in the 0.5 mL of enzyme dilution added 
to the assay to the enzyme concentration in the original solution, for which FPU values are 
desired), the right side of equation therefore wind s up with units (mmol min-1mL-1) that look like 
"International Units per mL" (I.U./mL).  Ghose himself points out, however, that "because the 
FPU assay is non-linear, the use of the International Unit per se  is incorrect as this unit is based 
on initial velocities, i.e., linear reactions in which the product is produced at the same rate during each and every minute of the reaction."  The auth or goes on to recommend that FPU values for a 
given cellulase solution be given simply as "units/mL".    "Definition" of the "Filter Paper Unit":  As a result of the above choice of numerical values, the "Filter Paper Unit" is not actually explicitly defined.  What is
 defined is the quantity 0.1875 FPU, wh ich is that quantity of enzyme 
activity that, when assayed according to the inst ructions contained here in, will produce reducing 
sugar equivalent to 2.0 mg of glucose.  One ca n verify this from the equation presented in the 
calculations section by assuming that the enzyme solution being tested needs no dilution to yield reducing sugar equivalent to 2.0 mg of glucose (i.e., the "enzyme concentration" ratio in the 
denominator is equal to 1.0), in which case the ac tivity of the solution being tested is measured 
as 0.37 filter paper units per mL.  Inasmuch as 0.5 mL  of this solution was used in the assay, the 
absolute quantity of enzyme activity that is present in the assay (and to which the observed effect can be ascribed) is 0.1875 FPU.    To put it another way, we have a defined me thod for measuring the activity of a cellulase 
solution containing 0.1875 filter paper units per 0.5 mL assay aliquot (0.37 filter paper units per 
mL of enzyme solution) but we do not have me thod for measuring the filter paper activity of 
solutions with any other value.  Solutions containing more than 0.37 "units" per mL must therefore be diluted to this sta ndard value to be measured, and so lutions containing less than 0.37 
"units" per mL (reducing sugar produced in 60 minut es is less than that equivalent to 2.0 mg of 
glucose) cannot be assigned "filter paper unit”  activities at all.  These latter "sub-2.0-mg" 
solutions either must be concentrated before assay, or the activities s hould not be reported as 
"filter paper units" at all, but s hould be reported instead as "mmole s glucose equivalents released 
per minute averaged over 60 minutes."  Ghose (1987) explains the speci al circumstances involved in measurement of "filter paper 
activity", and workers are urged to pay close attenti on to the text of the paper (especially the text 
surrounding the equations on page 263 of the referenc e) rather than just "lifting" the equations 
themselves.
