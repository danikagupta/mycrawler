propofol versus barbiturates for controlling
refractory status epilepticus

Abstract
Background: Several studies have compared the efficacy and safety of propofol and barbiturates in the treatment
of refractory status epilepticus (RSE). This study aims to quantitatively assess the advantages and disadvantages of
propofol and barbiturates in controlling RSE.
Methods: We searched for studies with relevant data from the PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, Springer
Link, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. By calculating odds ratios and
standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals, we assessed the disease control rate (DCR), case
fatality rate (CFR), average control time (ACT), average tracheal intubation placement time (ATIPT), and incidence of
hypotension between propofol and barbiturates in treating RSE.
Results: Seven studies with 261 patients were included in this analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that the DCR of
propofol was higher than that of barbiturates ( p< 0.001) and that the CFR ( p= 0.382) between the two treatment
did not significantly differ in controlling RSE. Propofol shortened the ACT (p < 0.001) of RSE and reduced the ATIPT
(p < 0.001) of patients with RSE more extensively than did barbiturates and did not increase the incidence of
hypotension ( p= 0.737).
Conclusions: In comparison with barbiturates, propofol can control RSE and shorten ATIPT in a more efficient and
timely manner. Moreover, the drug does not increase the incidence of hypotension and CFR.

Background
Refractory status epilepticus (R SE) is an acute critical illness
characterized by recurrent or persistent epilepsy; it is a
complex and rapidly progressing disease with a high mor-
tality rate of 15% for RSE and 40% for super-RSE [ 1]. Clin-
ically, RSE is defined as status epilepticus that continues or
recurs 24 h or more after the onset of anesthetic therapy
despite the administration of two appropriately selected
and dosed antiepileptic drugs, including benzodiazepine
[2–4] .I t sm o s tp r o m i n e n tf e a t u r ei st h a ti ti si n s e n s i t i v et o
conventional antiepileptic d rugs. First-line drugs for RSE
treatment are currently bei ng developed. When the pre-
ferred method is ineffective, multiple treatment methods
are recommended for guiding follow-up treatment [ 5]. Anumber of intravenous anest hetic drugs are often used to
treat RSE, such as barbiturates ( e.g., pentobarbital, thiopen-
tal, etc.), midazolam, and propofol [ 5].
Due to its pharmacokinetic characteristics of rapid onset
and short half-life, propofol is now used in the treatment
of RSE [ 5]. However, propofol may also exert adverse reac-
tions, such as hypotension, severe metabolic acidosis, and
rhabdomyolysis; moreover, its safety has been questioned
by some clinicians [ 6]. Many medical centers in Europe
and the United States have used propofol to treat RSE and
found increased risks of developing propofol infusion syn-
drome; reducing the amount of propofol by adding mid-
azolam may help reduce the incidence of this syndrome
[7]. Therefore, benzodiazepines and barbiturates appear to
be the mainstream drugs for treating RSE [ 8]. At present,
evidence-based medicinal data for the treatment of RSE
with propofol are lacking. Some studies have compared

of RSE, but the results have not been comparable [ 5–7].
Herein, we collected observational investigations to com-
pare the efficacy of propofol and barbiturates for treating
RSE and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis
to quantitatively assess the advantages and disadvantages
of these two treatments.
Methods
Literature search
We searched the following scientific medical databases
for studies comparing the effi cacy of propofol and barbitu-
rates in the treatment of RSE: PubMed, Embase, Ovid,
Cochrance Library, Springer Link, Web of Science, and
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The
time frame for the document search was from the date of
database establishment to M arch 2018. The keywords used
for retrieval included: “epilepsy, ”“antiepileptic drugs, ”“pro-
pofol, ”“2,6-bisisopropylphenol, ”“diisopropyl phenol, ”
“diprivan, ”“disoprofol, ”“barbiturates, ”“phenobarbitol, ”
“thiopental, ”“secobarbital, ”“fosphenytoin, ”“refractory
status epilepticus, ”“status epilepticus, ”“generalized status
epilepticus, ”“disoprofol, ”and “RSE. ”The search strategy in-
volved the combination of the topic of propofol with that
of barbiturates and their combination with RSE. We
applied Boolean operators, wildcards, and field identifiers
to group search terms. Meta-analysis was then conducted
according to the Preferred Repo rting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement [ 9].
Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) The patients
under study must meet the diagnostic criteria for RSE of
the International League Against Epilepsy [ 3]; (2) the
study must be a controlled trial or at least a case-control
study; (3) patient inclusion must not be limited by age
and gender; (4) the study must clearly compare the
efficacy of propofol and barbiturates for controlling RSE;
and (5) the study should have at least one observation of
(a) disease control rate (DCR), which is the rate of
seizure control defined as a period of over 12 h in which
clinical epileptic seizure or EEG seizure is terminated
after medication, (b) case fatality rate (CFR), (c) average
control time (ACT) and hypotension incidence, or (d)
average tracheal intubation placement time (ATIPT) and
provide data on means and standard deviations.
Exclusion criteria
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) The study
included patients with head injuries; (2) the sample size of
the propofol and barbiturate groups was unclear; (3) research
costs were provided by drug manufacturers or studies were
initiated by drug producers; (4) the dose and time of admin-
istration of propofol and barbiturates were not indicated; (5)general treatment methods (rehydration, cooling, dehydra-
tion, reducing cranial pressure, maintenance of vital signs,
and other routine treatment) for the two groups were not ex-
plained clearly or unbalanced, and (6) no clear observable
data for efficacy evaluation were provided.
Extraction of variables
The extracted data included: ( 1) Researchers, publication
date, and country; (2) group of patients and the cor-
responding number of cases; (3) general demographics,
s u c ha sa g ea n dg e n d e r ;( 4 )A c u t eP h y s i o l o g ya n dC h r o n i c
Health Evaluation II (APACHE II); (5) the design of the
study (retrospective or prospective) and the usage method
and dose of propofol and barbiturates; and (6) the efficacy
index of therapy (i.e., DCR, CFR, ACT, hypotension
incidence, and ATIPT).
Methodological assessment
We mainly adopted the criteria of the Cochrane Hand-
book (Version 5.0.1) to assess the quality of the included
studies, which was special for the systematic review of
interventions [ 10]. These criteria present a judgement
and support for the judgement for each entry in a “risk
of bias ”table, where each entry addresses a specific fea-
ture of the study. The judgement for each entry involved
assessment of the risk of bias as “low risk, ”“high risk, ”
or“unclear risk, ”with the last category indicating either
a lack of information or uncertainty over the potential
for bias [ 10]. Two investigators independently reviewed
and determined the quality of each study. Discrepancies
were resolved by consensus with a third expert.
Statistical analysis
(1) We used the χ2test and the I2statistical test to deter-
mine whether the included literature had heterogeneity.
When the results of the χ2test indicated a pvalue greater
than 0.10 and the I2value was ≤50%, which indicates that
the possibility of heterogeneity among studies is small, we
chose the fixed effect model of meta-analysis; otherwise,
we attempted to identify the cause of heterogeneity and
used the random-effect model for meta-analysis. (2) For
measurement data, we used standard mean differences
(SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate
statistical effects; for count data, we use odds ratios (ORs)
and 95% CIs. (3) The total effect of the meta-analysis was
expressed using the Zvalue, which is considered statisti-
cally significant when p< 0.05. (4) We deleted studies one
by one and recalculated the statistical effect of this de-
letion to determine whether a single study produced an
impact on the overall statistical results. (5) We drew a fun-
nel plot and performed Begg and Egger tests to determine
the possibility of publication bias. (6) Meta-analysis was
performed using Revman 5.2 (Cochrane Collaboration)
and Stata 14.0 (Stata Corporation, TX, USA) software.Zhang et al. BMC Neurology           (2019) 19:55 Page 2 of 11General measurement statistics were completed using
SPSS (version 21.0, Chicago, USA) software.
Results
Seven studies were qualified for this meta-analysis
A total of 103 articles were considered closely correlated to
the concept of this study. Based on the inclusion criteria, 59
articles, including reviews, animal studies, summary of mee-
tings, and single-arm studies, were considered ineligible for
the present study. Of the remaining 44 studies, another 28
documents were excluded because of the following reasons:
lack of a clear control group (6 studies), lack of usable end
points (7 studies), duplication of another study (1 study),
unclear methodology (6 studies), unreliable statistical design
(5 studies), and small sample size (3 studies). Hence, 16 stu-
dies were considered to meet our inclusion criteria. However,
another 9 documents, including a rticles describing the simul-
taneous use of benzodiazepines (7 studies) and those lacking
the observation data required for meta-analysis (2 studies),
were eventually excluded from our corpus. Finally, 7 quali-
fied studies [ 11–17] were subjected to meta-analysis (Fig. 1).
The included studies presented good homogeneity and
comparability in terms of demographics
As shown in Table 1, the seven included studies [ 11–17]
were reported between 2005 and 2017 and involved a total
of 261 patients. A total of 134 patients were enrolled in
the propofol group, and 127 patients were enrolled in the
barbiturate group. In the propofol group, 51.8% of thepatients were male, while 48.2% were female. In the
barbiturate group, 58.9% of the patients were male, while
41.1% were female. In addition, three studies [ 11–13]
reported APACHE II data. Statistical analyses revealed that
the demographics between the propofol and barbiturate
groups did not significantly differ ( p>0 . 0 5 ) .
Methodological assessment indicated that the included
studies had moderate to high study quality
Table 2shows that the seven included studies [ 11–17]
were all retrospective in nature. Five studies [ 11–13,16,
17] were reported in China, one was performed in the
Netherlands [ 14], and another study originated from
Switzerland [ 15]. Except for one study [ 15], the rest of
the studies [ 11–14,16,17] provided detailed drug use,
time, dose, and delivery pathways (Table 2). Nearly all of
the included studies [ 11–17] provided key indicators for
evaluating efficacy but did not reveal whether blinding
and hidden allocation were performed. Summary ana-
lysis indicated that the included studies had moderate to
high study quality (Fig. 2a and b).
Heterogeneity analysis
When comparing DCRs between propofol and barbitu-
rates, the results of heterogeneity testing suggested a
χ2statistic of 4.85 (degrees of freedom = 6; p= 0.563) and
I2statistic (due to the heterogeneity in OR changes) of
0%. When comparing CFRs, the results suggested a
χ2statistic of 2.55 (degrees of freedom = 5; p= 0.768) and
Fig. 1 Flow chart of selection process for studies included in meta-analysis. At f irst, 103 investigations were define d to be closely correlated to the conc eption of
this study. After a careful screening, a total of 7 studies met the inclusion c riteria, which were searched from the database of Medline/PubMed, EMBAS E, Cochrance
Library, Web of Science and China Nationa l Knowledge Infrastructure DatabaseZhang et al. BMC Neurology           (2019) 19:55 Page 3 of 11I2statistic of 0%. These results indicate the absence of
heterogeneity between groups. Hence, we used the
fixed-effect model of meta-analysis with the data to
calculate for overall effects. When comparing ACT and
ATIPT, the results suggested χ2statistics of 62.53 and
81.93 (both p< 0.001) and I2statistics of 93.6 and 95.1%,
respectively. Although these values indicate heterogeneity
in the data, the included studies had very good homoge-
neity from the clinical design perspective, and their design
and implementation were well comparable. Hence, we
used the random-effects model of meta-analysis with the
data to complete our analysis.
The DCR of propofol was significantly higher than that of
barbiturates in controlling RSE
Table 3shows that seven studies [ 11–17]c o m p a r e dD C R
between propofol and barbiturate in treating RSE. The
ORs of the included studies ranged from 1.0 to 9.51%, the
pooled OR derived from the fixed-effect model of the
meta-analysis was 3.20, and the 95% CIs were in the range
of 1.71 –6( F i g . 3a). This finding indicates that the DCR ofpropofol is significantly higher than that of barbiturates in
controlling RSE ( z=3 . 6 3 , p<0 . 0 0 1 ) .
The CFR between propofol and barbiturates in the
treatment of RSE did not significantly differ
Table 3shows that six studies [ 11–16]c o m p a r e dt h eC F R
between propofol and barbiturates in the treatment of RSE.
The ORs of the included studies ranged from 0.23 to 1.5%,
the pooled OR derived from the fixed effect model of
meta-analysis was 0.73, and the 95% CIs were in the range
of 0.37 –1.46 (Fig. 3b). This finding in dicates that the CFR
between propofol and barbiturates in the treatment of RSE
does not significantly differ ( z= 0.82, p= 0.382).
Propofol significantly shortened the ACT of RSE
compared with barbiturates
Table 3shows that five studies [ 11–13,16,17]c o m p a r e d
the ACT of RSE between propofol and barbiturates in the
treatment of RSE. The random-effect combined SMD was
−3.62 and the 95% CIs were in the range of −5.63 to −1.62,
which shows that the ACT of propofol is significantly lessTable 1 Description of the included studies

These results indicate that propofol significantly shortens the
ACT of RSE compared with barbiturates.
Propofol obviously reduced the ATIPT of patients with
RSE compared with barbiturates
Table 3shows that five studies [ 11–13,15,17] compared
the ATIPT of patients with RSE between propofol and
barbiturates. The random-effect combined SMD was −
8.43 (95% CI: −12 to −4.86; z= 4.63, p< 0.001), which
means the ATIPT of the barbiturate group is signifi-
cantly longer than that of the propofol group (z = 4.63,
p< 0.001) (Fig. 4b).
Propofol did not increase the incidence of hypotension
compared with barbiturates
Table 3shows that three studies [ 12,15,16] compared the
incidence of hypotension between propofol and barbitu-
rates in the treatment of RSE. The ORs of the included
studies ranged from 0.75 to 1.75%, the pooled OR derived
from the fixed-effect model of the meta-analysis was 0.87,
and the 95% CIs were in the range of 0.38 –1.97 (Fig. 5a).
This finding indicates that the incidence of hypotensionbetween propofol and barbiturates does not significantly
differ in the treatment of RSE ( z=0 . 3 4 , p=0 . 7 3 7 ) .
Analysis of sensitivity
To determine whether individual studies included directly
affected the overall statistical effect, we conducted a series
of sensitivity analyses on these indicators. Table 4shows
that the largest estimate was 1.42, whereas the lowest esti-
mate was 1.2. The estimates for each study were basically
distributed on both sides of the average estimate (1.31).
The results suggest that exclusion of individual studies
does not substantially alter estimates or affect the final
statistical performance.
Analysis of publication bias
The results of Egger testing suggested a Tvalue of −0.46
(Pr > | t| = 0.668), while the results of Begg testing dem-
onstrated that Pr > | z| = 0.652 with a standard deviation
of 6.66 (Pr > | z| = 0.764). The distribution graph derived
from the Egger test showed that the included studies
were evenly distributed on both sides of the baseline
(Fig. 6a). In addition, the funnel plot derived from the
Begg test indicated that all seven studies were sym-
metrically distributed on both sides of the funnel plot

Discussion
In recent years, the reactivity of anti-epileptic drug treat-
ments has gradually attracted researchers ’attention in
the treatment of status epilepticus. Approximately 23 –
48% of all patients with status epilepticus may experi-
ence seizures after standard first- and second-line treat-
ment [ 2,18]. Patients in epileptic states with over 2 h of
continuous epileptic seizures beyond the control of first-
and second-line antiepileptic drugs may need to be ad-
ministered anesthetic drugs for treatment [ 19]. Propofol
presents the advantage of high lipophilicity; it has a large
volume of distribution, and it can be rapidly taken up
and eliminated in the central nervous system. These
characteristics confer the drug a certain advantage in the
treatment of RSE [ 7,20]. Some studies have specifically
investigated the clinical effect of propofol versus barbitu-
rates in treating RSE. In the present work, we performed
a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to assess
the clinical benefit of propofol in controlling RSE.
Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis ac-
cording to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria;
in total, these studies reported 134 patients in the propofol
group and 127 in the barbiturate group. Statistical analysisof the demographics between the propofol and barbiturate
group indicated that the included studies were of good
homogeneity and comparability. Except for blinding and
allocation concealment, which may be mainly due to me-
dical ethics restrictions and the severity of RSE, all seven
studies were effective in other areas and methodology. In
the heterogeneity analysis of count data (DCR, CFR, and
hypotension incidence), no statistical heterogeneity was
found between studies. However, two indicators of mea-
surement data (ACT and ATIPT) revealed statistical he-
terogeneity. Hence, the heterogeneity observed may have
originated from differences in drug dose and disease se-
verity. Overall, however, the data obtained showed very
good homogeneity from the clinical design perspective,
and the design and implementation of these studies were
well comparable. Our sensitivity analysis indicated that ex-
clusion of individual studies does not substantially alter
estimates or affect the final statistical performance. Egger
and Begg test results also proved that the studies included
in the present meta-analysis did not have publication bias.
Our study showed that the DCR (DCR is the rate of
seizure control, defined as a period of more than 12 h in
which clinical epileptic seizure or EEG seizure are termi-
nated after medication) of propofol is significantly higher
than that of barbiturates in controlling RSE; CFR did not
significantly differ between groups. Barbiturates increase

(GABA), hinder the effect of glutamate, inhibit the brain
stem reticular structure activation system, and reduce
the excitability of the cerebral cortex [ 21]. Thus, they
could be used to treat RSE when other drugs fail to con-
trol it [ 22]. Propofol is a non-barbiturate intravenous
anesthetic with high lipid solubility and a plasma protein
binding rate of 97 –98%. It has been proven to exert strong
antiepileptic effects. The mechanism of action of this drugmay include: (1) unique inhibition of the central nervous
system, (2) enhanced GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition,
and (3) reduced excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate
and aspartate) [ 23,24]. A meta-analysis in 2002 showed
that the efficacy, CFR, and residual function loss among
patients with RSE treated with propofol, pentobarbital,
and midazolam do not significantly differ [ 25]. We found
that propofol could significantly increase the DCR of RSE
and does not increase the CFR of patients compared with

rates in controlling RSE.
Failure to control RSE in a timely manner often leads
to disturbance of consciousness in patients with high
fever, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, shock, electro-
lyte imbalance, myoglobinuria, multiple organ failure,
autonomic nerves disorder, and other life-threatening
conditions [ 8,13,18,25]. Therefore, terminating RSE as
soon as possible is an important means to reduce the
CFR and disability rate. Our study suggests that propofol
significantly shortens the ACT of RSE compared with
barbiturates, which means the former is more effective
than the latter in controlling RSE. Propofol terminates

tenance of burst-suppression EEG patterns requires re-
petitive titration of doses [ 26]. In adult RSE therapy,
propofol exerts control efficacy toward RSE similar to
that of midazolam but is superior to barbital, can
shorten recovery times, and accelerate the recovery of
neuromotor and cognitive functions [ 27]. Endotracheal
intubation is an extremely important aspect of RSE the-
rapy. Our results indicated that propofol is superior to
barbiturates in both indicators of ACT and ATIPT be-
cause it shortens the ACT of RSE and quickly terminates
RSE, which would reduce the degree of damage to the pa-
tient ’s brain and body. In addition, the ATIPT of patients
with RSE in the propofol group was significantly shor-
tened compared with that of patients in the barbiturate
group, thereby indicating that patients in the former
group recovered quickly and propofol reduces complica-
tions. The duration of mechanical ventilation in patients
directly affects the occurrence of ventilator-associated
pneumonia (VAP), and shortening the duration of mech-
anical ventilation is an important measure to reduce the
incidence of VAP [ 28]. Prolonged ATIPT in the barbitur-
ate group is well explained by its long half-life. Barbitu-
rates act by enhancing the action of GABA-alpha receptor,
which may exert a neuroprotective role and is beneficial
to SRSE. The main disadvantage of barbiturates, however,
is their rapid redistribution, which leads to accumulation
and prolonged half-lives that can reach hours or days [ 29].
Furthermore, prolonged intubation is an established
cost-driving factor in RSE. Hence, the use of propofol
might lower the cost of RSE in the long run [ 30].
Although propofol features good pharmacokinetic char-
acteristics, cardiovascular tolerance, and significant anti-
epileptic effects, it can also cause hypotension and
propofol infusion syndrome [ 6,7]. Previous studies have
also revealed that the advantages of barbiturates in the
treatment of RSE include their high efficiency and low re-
lapse rate; some of its disadvantages, however, include a
high incidence of hypotension and long mechanical venti-
lation [ 26,31]. Our study showed that the incidence of
hypotension did not significantly differ between propofol
and barbiturates during treatment of RSE. Research has
proposed that long-term infusion of propofol may induce
propofol infusion syndrome, which is mainly manifested
by severe metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
failure, refractory heart failure, and hyperlipidemia [ 32]. In
our meta-analysis, none of the studies mentioned propofol
infusion syndrome, although this finding may be due to
reporting bias. Larger, randomized, controlled trials are
needed to observe this side effect. Other adverse effects of
propofol may include fever, transient dystonia, increased
muscle enzymes, and increased blood lipids [ 6,8,24]. In
our meta-analysis, except for hypotension, none of the
included studies reported other side effects, which impliesthat the short-term use of propofol does not cause serious
adverse events.
A recent study provided class III evidence that patients
with SE receiving five IV anesthetic drugs (IVADs) have a
higher proportion of infections and increased risk of death
compared with patients not receiving IVADs [ 8]. Relevant
guidelines indicate that, during treatment of convulsive
RSE, continuous IVADs (CIVADs) should be considered
to induce therapeutic coma (TC) when benzodiazepines
and non-sedative antiepileptic drugs fail as initial treat-
ment [ 33]. Induction of TC is applied to stop seizure acti-
vity and hypothetically prevent seizure-induced brain
damage and reduce cerebral metabolism. However, one
study from the United States and Europe on the use of TC
for RSE treatment indicated that IVADs do not affect
mortality but increase length of hospital stay [ 33]. At
present, the level of evidence of the effectiveness and
safety of narcotic drugs, such as propofol, barbiturates,
and midazolam, remains relatively low in the treatment of
RSE. Each anesthetic presents its own characteristics and
risks. The specific anesthetic used in this research to co-
ntrol RSE is currently not supported by high-quality me-
dical evidence.
Some deficiencies in the current study must be noted.
First, most of the included studies contained relatively
small sample sizes. Second, subtle differences in the use
of drugs were noted between studies, and these diffe-
rences may lead to methodological heterogeneity. Third,
most of the studies included in our analyses originated
from China, and the results obtained may include geo-
graphical bias. Fourth, except for hypotension, none of
the studies provided specific data on other adverse
effects of propofol and barbiturates. Finally, none of the
studies included in this meta-analysis provided time data
of the recurrence of epilepsy. Hence, future research
should focus on these limitations.
Conclusion
The DCR of propofol was higher than that of barbiturates,
and the CFR between the two treatments did not signifi-
cantly differ in controlling RSE. Compared with barbitu-
rates, propofol shortened the ACT of RSE and reduced
the ATIPT of patients with RSE more extensively, and the
drug did not increase the incidence of hypotension. Open,
multicenter, randomized controlled trials are necessary to
provide more robust and powerful clinical evidence of the
effects of profopol on RSE.
