This book is a first-level text on water chemistry that places special 
emphasis on the chemistry of natural and polluted waters and on the 
applied chemistry of water and wastewater treatment. It provides a 
comprehensive coverage of the dilute aqueous solution chemistry of acid­
base reactions. complex formation, precipitation and dissolution reac­
tions, and oxidation-reduction reactions. Although it is written primarily 
for students and those individuals who are currently working in environ­
mental or sanitary engineering, much of its contents should also prove 
to be of value to chemists, biologists, ecologists, and geochemists. We 
assume that the readers will have a good background in general chem­
istry; additional knowledge in the fields of analytical and physical 
chemistry is useful but not essential. The material in the text has been 
satisfactorily taught to advanced undergraduates and first-level graduate 
students in environmental engineering with one year of elementary 
chemistry as a background. 
This book provides an integrated coverage of chemical kinetic and 
equilibrium principles and applies them to water chemistry in its broadest 
sense, that is, to natural and polluted water and to water and wastewater 
treatment processes. Special attention is paid to the effects of temperature 
and ionic strength on reactions. In the first introductory chapter, the 
characteristics of the various types of water of concern are presented 
along with a discussion of the concentration units unique to water 
chemistry. Chapters 2 and 3 provide the background in chemical kinetics 
and thermodynamics necessary for the subsequent coverage of water 
chemistry. If the text is to be used for teaching students with background 
in physical chemistry, Chapters 2 and 3 may be read for review purposes 
only. Chapters 4 to 6, and 7 deal, respectively, with acid-base, complex­
ation, precipitation·dissolution, and oxidation-reduction chemistry. In 
each of these chapters we first present the necessary principles for 
understanding the systems to be encountered and then the necessary 
tools to solve problems; following this, we present one or more applications 
of the topic in the water or wastewater areas. The graphical solution of 
equilibrium problems is stressed throughout the book. The acid-base 
chemistry chapter concludes with a detailed discussion of the carbonate 
system. The complexation chapter deals at length with the organic and 
inorganic complexes of metal ions found in natural waters. Phosphate 
chemistry and heterogenous calcium carbonate equilibria and kinetics 
are presented as applications of the principles of precipitation·dissolution 
presented in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7, the topics of corrosion, iron 
chemistry, chlorine chemistry, biologically important redox reactions, 
and prinCiples of electrochemical measurements are presented to iIIus-viii Preface 
trate the importance and practical application of the principles of oxi­
dation:reduction reactions. 
Numerous example problems are presented throughout the discussion 
as aids to the understanding of the subject matter. Many problems are 
presented at the end of the chapters_ The answers to these problems are 
given in an appendix so that readers can test their knowledge_ References 
to more detailed treatments of selected topics are given at the end of 
each chapter.

J. F. Ferguson, and J. O. Leckie, 3rd ed" John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New 
York, 1980, initially published by the Association of Environmental 
Engineering Professors, contains many experiments that are based on 
the principles presented in this book. The laboratory manual is written 
for use in the same type of course for which this text is written. The 
nomenclature and format of these two texts are designed to make them 
companion volumes for an integrated lecture-laboratory course.

453 L INTRODUCTION 
1.1. PROPERTIES OF WATER 
Although the title of this book is Water Chemistry, the contents deal 
only slightly with the chemistry of H20. With a few exceptions it is only 
in this introductory chapter that we feel compelled to even talk about the 
properties of H20. In common with the usage adopted by the sanitary! 
environmental engineering profession and other branches of the scientific 
community. we use the word water to mean the dilute aqueous solution! 
suspension of inorganic and organic compounds that constitutes various 
types of aquatic systems. This book is about the interactions between 
these compounds. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English 
Language 1 concisely draws the distinction we want to make in its first 
three definitions of the word water. 
"Water (wa'taI, wot'ar) n. 1. A clear colorless, nearly odorless and tasteless 
liquid, H20, essential for most plant and animal life and the most widely used 
of all solvents. Melting point O°C (32°F), boiling point 100°C (212°F), specific 
gravity WC) 1.0000, weight per gallon (15°C) 8.337 pounds. 2. Any of various 
forms of water such as rain. 3. Any body of water such as a sea, lake, river, 
or stream," 
This book is largely directed toward a consideration of the type~ of 
waters exemplified by definitions 2 and 3. However. it would be remiss 
if we did not consider the important properties of water that make it such 
a dominant aspect of our environment. 
Most water molecules have a molecular weight pf 18. However. since 
hydrogen and oxygen each have 3 isotopes. there exist 18 possible 
molecular weights for water. In the water molecule both hydrogen atoms 
are located on the same side of the oxygen atom; their bonds with the 
oxygen atom are 105° apart. The hydrogen atoms carry a positive charge 
while the oxygen atom is negatively charged. Because of this distribution 
of charge. H20 is a strongly dipolar molecule. The water molecule dipoles 
1 The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, William Morris, ed. 
American Heritage and Houghton. 1969. p. 1447. 2 Introduction 
attract each other and form aggregates through bonds that are known as 
"hydrogen bonds"; 
It is thought that these aggregates in water at room temperature can 
reach sizes of up to about 100 H20 molecules.' 
The hydrogen bonding in water is responsible for many of the unusual 
properties possessed by this substance. Water is the dihydride of oxygen. 
I! we compare it with the dihydrides of the elements in the same family 
of the periodic table as oxygen, that is, hydrogen sulfide, H2S; hydrogen 
selenide, H2Se; and hydrogen telluride, H2Te, we find that many of its 
physical properties are anomalous. At atmospheric pressure and room 
temperature (25°C) the heavier molecules, H2S (molecular weight 34), H2Se 
(molecular weight 81), and H2Te (molecular weight 130), are all gases. 
Water is a liquid that becomes a gas only when the temperature is 
increased to 100°C and above. It is far denser than its related species at 
any given temperature; the maximum density is at 4°C. Its surface tension 
and dielectric constant are much higher than would be predicted from 
the properties of the other dihydrides. Its freezing point is lower than 
would be expected, and it freezes to form ice, an open-structured substance 
that is less dense than the liquid water from which it forms. All of these 
properties (and many more) are caused by the hydrogen bonding between 
H20 molecules. The last property-that in which H20 forms a less dense 
solid than the liquid from which it forms-has far-reaching ramifications. 
I! solid H20 were denser than liquid H20, ice would form at the bottom 
of natural bodies of water rather than at the top. Lakes would freeze from 
the bottom upward and, consequently, life in its present form in aquatic 
systems would not exist because n<;ttural bodies of water would freeze 
solid whenever the temperature fell below the freezing point of water. 
The polarity of water is an important factor in determining its solvent 
properties. The minerals that make up the earth's crust are largely 
inorganic solids in which positively charged and negatively charged ions 
exist in a lattice structure, attracted to each other by electrostatic bonds. 
Water, with its dipolar character, has the power to surround a positively 
charged ion with the negatively charged part of its molecule (or conversely 
surround the negatively charged crystal ion with the positively charged 
part of its molecule), thereby isolating the ion from its surrounding ions 
2 G. Nemethy and G. H. Scheraga, "Structure of Water and Hydrophobic Bonding 
in Proteins. 1. A Model for/the Thermodynamic Properties of Liquid Water," J. 
Phys. Chern., 36: 3382 (1962). Composition of Several Types of Water 3 
and neutralizing the forces of attraction that maintain the integrity of the 
crystal structure. The ion, surrounded (or hydrated) by water molecules, 
can then leave the crystal lattice and move out into solution-it becomes 
a dissolved ion. 
In the last analysis the solvent properties of water make necessary the 
several dictionary definitions of the word water. Water dissolves some 
(small or large) amount of virtually every solid or gas with which it comes 
in contact. In the global cycle of water on the earth (the hydrologic cycle), 
water contacts the gases in the atmosphere (including air pollutants and 
volcaniC emissions) and the minerals in the top few kilometers of the 
earth's crust. On a smaller scale water circulates in man-made systems 
(conduits and pipes made from synthetic minerals, such as concrete, and 
refined metals such as iron and copper). The solvent powers of water are 
exerted in these systems leading to such general phenomena as corrosion 
and scaling. 
1.2. COMPOSITION OF SEVERAL TYPES OF WATER 
The general compositiori. of the various types of water in the hydrosphere 
can best be discussed within the framework of the hydrologic cycle. Of 
the total amount of water on the earth the oceans account for the vast 
majority: 97.13 percent. The polar ice caps and glaciers contain 2.24 
percent; groundwater accounts for 0.61 percent; and the rivers, lakes, and 
streams contain only 0.02 percent of the total. 
The ocean is an approximately 1.1 M solution of anions plus cations; 
its average composition is given in Table 1-1. In this table the category

of "other solids" incorporates a wide variety of species that includes just 
about' every element present in the earth's crust. In this category average 
concentrations range from moderate (Sr (8 mglliter), SiO, (S.4 mg/liter), B 
(4.S mg/liter), and F (1.3 mglliter)) to small (N (0.5 mg/liter), Li (0.17 mg/ 
liter), P (0.07 mg/liter), and I (O.OS mg/liter)) to minute (Cd (0.0001 mg/liter), 
Cr (0.00005 mg/liter), and Hg (0.00003 mglliter)) to miniscule (Pa (2 x 10-' 
mg/liter)and Ra (l x 10-10 mg/liter)). The dissolved salt content of sea 
water (total dissolved solids of approximately 34,500 mg/liter) is sufficient 
to raise ils specific gravily at 20°C to a value of 1.0243 g/cc, which is 
significantly greater than pure water. 
From the oceans, water evaporates and then is transported over land 
masses, where il can be deposiled as one or another form of precipitation 
(rain, snow, hail, etc.). During its passage from the ocean to the land 
surface, water passes through" the earth's lower atmosphere. Because of 
this, the water has a chance to equilibrate with the gases in the 
atmosphere. The mean composition of the lower atmosphere is shown in 
Table 1-2. It should be realized that the mean composition of the earth's 
atmosphere is subject to considerable variation, especially in the levels 
of some of the minor constituents such as CO" CO, SO" NO" and so

forth, which are products of combustion processes and are associated 
with the air pollution that accompanies urban-industrial communities_ 
The major atmospheric constituents, N, and 0" are both sparingly 
soluble in water (17.5 and 39.3 mg/kg, respectively, at 250C)3 but some of 
the minor constituents, for example, CO, and SO" are very soluble (1450 
and 94,100 mg/kg, respectively, at 25°C). The composition of precipitation 
is quite variable and greatly influenced by atmospheric contaminants. 
Precipitation near the oceans contains more SO/-, CI-, Na+, and Mg2+ 
than precipitation that falls in the interior of a great land mass. Rain and 
snow that are generated from an atmosphere containing high concentra­
tions of combustion-generated SO, can be very acidic. Even so, the figures 
in Table 1-3 show that rainwater is indeed an extremely dilute solution

3 The solubility of gas is expressed as the weight of gas (mg) dissolved in I kg of

of dissolved salts, indicating the remarkable efficiency of the distillation 
process that results in the production of "fresh water" from seawater. 
Note that the pH of "unpolluted" precipitation (5.5 to 6.5) is significantly 
lower than that of the seawater from which it was generated. This is a 
reflection of the equilibration that has taken place with atmospheric CO,. 
Rainwater is poorly buffered so that it cannot maintain its neutral pH in 
the presence of even these small amounts of acid-producing gases. 
In precipitation, water falls onto the land surface and comes in contact 
with rocks, sediments, and soils and the animal and plant inhabitants of 
the land surface. Chemical reactions take place that further modify the 
composition of the water. The reactions can be viewed in general terms 
as a giant global acid-base titration in which the acids of the rainwater 
(CO" SO" and NO,) titrate the bases of the rocks. Since the composition 
of the land surface and the extent and nature of biological activity 
(including man's activity) vary from one place to another, we can expect 
.that waters of a variety of compositions will result from these reactions. 
The time and intimacy of contact between water and rocks also influences 
the composition of the solution. 
Surface waters that originate in basins where the major rocks are 
granite contain very small amounts of dissolved minerals, not more than 
approximately 30 mg/liter. These are an important group of waters; for 
example, the water supplies of New York City (from the Catskill Moun­
tains), San Francisco and Oakland (from the Sierra Nevada Mountains), 
Seattle (from the Cascade Mountains), and many rivers and lakes in New 
England are of this type. They are illustrated by Type A, in Table 1-4,

The second general type of surface water (Table 1-4, Type B) originates 
from basins other than the granite basins described above. This water, 
typified by that of the Great Lakes (except Lake Superior) is of intermediate 
hardness (calcium plus magnesium), alkalinity (HCO, -), and total mineral 
content. This type of water is widely used as public water supplies for 
cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Detroit, Mil­
waukee; and many smaller places along the lakes and rivers of the St. 
Lawrence River Basin. 
Groundwaters generally have higher dissolved mineral concentrations 
than surface waters. This is because of the intimate contact between the 
CO,-bearing water and rocks and soils in the ground and the length of 
time for dissolution. Additionally, CO, may be added to the water in the 
soil by the activities of soil microorganisms. Example C in Table 1-4 is 
a groundwater from 30 to 60-ft-deep wells used for the public water supply 
of Dayton, Ohio. Waters such as this are widely distributed throughout 
the heartland of the United States. They usually require softening to make 
them acceptable for general domestic use and most industrial uses. 
In an earth unpopulated by living things the natural waters formed by 
water -air -earth interactions would now flow back to the ocean carrying 
their various dissolved constituents and suspended clay and silt particles. 
For the moment let us assume that we have a sterile earth. On the land 
surface the acids of the ahnosphere have attacked the bases of the rocks 
to produce a water containing dissolved minerals. The dissolution of 
these minerals from the rocks causes them to degrade and eventually to 
form clay minerals. Cations such as K+, Na+, CaH, and MgH are leached 
out of the rocks along with silica (SiO,) leaving behind a clay mineral. for 
example, montmorillonite, illite, or kaolinite, that is less rich in silica 
than the parent rock. These particles of clay minerals can be washed 
down the rivers along with the dissolved salts into the ocean. It has been 
proposed by Mackenzie and Garrels' that in the oceans the reverse of the 
reaction that weathered the rocks takes place. Cations, bicarbonate ion, 
and dissolved silica and clay minerals react to generate new rocks, which 
are laid down at the bottom of the ocean. Although the detailed arguments 
in support of this view are beyond the scope of this book, it is believed 
that the constancy of the concentrations of SiO" K+, and HCO, -in the 
ocean is attributable to this reaction. It is thought that this reaction 
controls the pH of the ocean at about pH 8.0. The reaction also helps to 
regulate the CO, content of the earth's atmosphere. Siever has summarized 
this global chemical scheme in the form of a series of chemical engineering 
processes (Fig. I-I).

The interlocking nature of these reactions on a global scale has some 
important consequences for the composition of natural waters, For ex· 
ample, the concentrations of the major dissolved constituents (Ca2+, Mg'+, 
Na+, Cl-, SOI-, HC0 3-, SiO",q,) vary over a rather narrow range because 
of the buffering action of these reactions. (See Fig, 1·2.) For the same 
reason, the composition of the ocean is fairly constant with respect to 
these major dissolved components. 
Now let us inhabit the earth with plants and animals. Their activities 
are important in altering the composition of natural waters at all stages 
of the hydrologic cycle. We have already seen that man's industrial 
activities can increase the acidity of the atmosphere and the water that 
comes in contact with it through precipitation. This increased activity 
can dissolve more minerals than would be possible with precipitation 
from unpolluted air. It has resulted in depressed pH values and increased 
mineral contents in the poorly buffered lakes in the Scandinavian coun· 
tries (polluted air from the industrial areas of northern Europe drifts north 
to Scandinavia) and in New England and Eastern Canada (polluted air 
from industrial sections of the United States drifts into New England and 
Canada). 
Man's activities affect water quality in a variety of other ways including Composition of Several Types of Water 9 
the discharge of municipal, industrial. and agricultural wastes into the 
surface~ and groundwaters. Domestic wastes contribute increases in the 
mineral and organic matter content of natural waters. Typically, a single 
municipal use of a water will contribute about 300 mg/liter of total 
dissolved minerals to a water. The individual components that make up 
these dissolved minerals are not present in the same ratio that one would 
typically expect from the dissolution of rocks by water. Thus Table 1-5 
shows that increases in CI-and Na+, NH4+ and NO, -are disproportionately 
greater than increases in Ca'+, Mg2+, and SO,'-. The contribution of these 
dissolved salts by municipal use has an important influence'on the degree 
to which wastewater can be recycled for reuse. 
Significant contributions of dissolved salts also arise from irrigated 
agriculture. Again the quantities and concentrations of the specific types 
of dissolved minerals are in different ratios than would be expected for 
the dissolution of the minerals of rocks. An excellent example of the 
striking effect that water returned from agricultural irrigation can have 
on water quality is given in Table 1-6, which shows the water quality in 
the Upper Colorado River Basin as one progresses from the headwaters 
in western Colorado downstream through Utah to Arizona. The high 
salinity (TDS) of this river has led to both interstate and international 
disputes (between Mexico and the United States), since the upstream salt 
loads produced by irrigated agriculture and natural runoff make the 
water unusable for many purposes in the downstream regions.

Wastewaters from industry, and domestic and agricultural sources 
contain a wide variety of organic compounds (see Tables 1-7 and 1-8). 
Typical domestic wastewater contains about 100 to 300 mglliter of organic 
carbon, 10 to 30 mglliter of organic nitrogen, and 1 to 2 mglliter of 
phosphorus bound to organic compounds. By comparison natural surface 
water concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are 
approximately 1 to 5, <1, and <0.5 mglliter, respectively. The impact of 
these organic materials from wastewater on natural water quality takes 
a variety of forms. Biodegradable organic compounds can either be 
removed in a waste treatment plant or they can be degraded by the 
natural water flora and fauna. In the latter case, the dilution provided to 
the wastewater by the receiving water is important because the concen­
trations of biodegradable organic matter in undiluted wastewater require 
many times more oxygen for their aerobic degradation than is present in 
water saturated with dissolved oxygen in contact with the earth's atmos­
phere. If sufficient dilution is not provided, the degradation of this organic TABLE 1-6 Quality of Water in Upper Colorado River Basin

matter can consume all the oxygen present and convert the water from 
an oxic state to an anoxic condition. This change can have far -reaching 
consequences for the chemistry of many species (see Chapter 7). 
The presence of nonbiodegradable (persistent) organics in wastewaters 
affects water in ways that depend on the nature of the materials. For 
example, the products of microbial degradation (humic materials) can 
give the water a brown color and can modify metal ion behavior (see 
Chapter 5). Toxic materials (both inorganic and organic) can modify or 
eliminate biological processes occurring in natural waters. Organics of 
industrial origin may cause taste and odor, or they may have undesirable 
health effects if they are not removed during drinking water purification. 
Organics of all types may react with water treatment chemicals, and new 
organics that have undesirable effects may be produced. 
Natural waters themselves are never free of organisms. Even water 
treated by disinfection for public supply contains microorganisms. The 
importance of organisms in natural water relates to the types of chemical 
transformations that they catalyze. We can divide these activities into 
two types: those that yield usable energy for the organism (catabolism) 
and those in which the organism expends energy (anabolism). Because 
the individual anabolic and catabolic reactions executed by microorga­
nisms are too numerous to discuss individually, we will give a few 
examples to illustrate how they influence natural water quality. Composition of Several Types of Water 13

Photosynthesis is the reaction in which organisms utilize radiant energy 
(sunlight) to drive an oxidation-reduction reaction in which carbon dioxide 
is reduced to organic matter by water with the production of oxygen. This 
reaction is fundamentally important in natural systems because its 
occurrence dictates that the aquatic system cannot be treated as a closed 
system. Photosynthesis uses an external (i.e .• nonchemical) source of 
energy to drive a reaction that is energetically impossible in a closed 
system. The occurrence of photosynthesis in natural systems also means 
that we may not treat them as equilibrium systems; we must find the 
steady state that results from the superimposition of the photosynthetic 
(nonequilibrium reaction) upon the chemical equilibria. Photosynthesis 
is ultimately responsible for most of the organic matter present on the 
earth and in natural waters; like many other biological reactions it affects 
water quality. Because photosynthetic organisms consume inorganic 
carbon (C02, HC03-. and CO,'-) from solution. they reduce the alkalinity 
and increase the pH of waters in which they grow. Substances whose 
solubility is inversely related to pH (e.g .. Mg(OH)",) and CaCO",) may 
precipitate from a photosynthesizing natural water. Photosynthesis pro­
duces oxygen so that we would expect oxic conditions in a water 
containing actively photosynthesizing organisms. 
Other energy-producing reactions of organisms involve the reduction 
of oxygen to water. the reduction of nitrate to ammonia and nitrogen gas. 
the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. and the reduction of carbon dioxide to 
methane. All 0"1 these reactions can exert a profound effect on water 
quality especially when it is realized that the affected chemical species 
also engage in many other chemical reactions. For example, the sulfide 
ion forms precipitates with many heavy metals. The microbial reduction 
of sulfate to sulfide could be accompanied by a reduction in the dissolved 
heavy metal content in a natural water. 
The anabolic activities of aquatic organisms also affect water quality. 14 Introduction 
Photosynthetic aquatic organisms withdraw inorganic carbon from so­
lution to provide building blocks for the organic compounds they syn­
thesize. Nonphotosynthetic organisms build their cell material from 
organic compounds, thereby modifying natural water organics. Since the 
construction of cell material requires the use of elements such as nitrogen, 
phosphorus, and potassium beside carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the 
growth of organisms in natural waters will modify the concentrations of 
these so-called nutrient elements. The growth of algae in a productive 
natural water can nearly completely deplete the nitrogen and phosphorus 
concentrations of the water; in fact, the situation often exists where the 
amount and rate of growth of aquatic photosynthetic organisms is 
controlled by the concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen (NH, +, NO,-) 
and phosphorus (POl-). 
In summary, the chemical reactions of atmosphere and the solids in 
the rocks of the land surface form dilute mineral solutions that we call 
surface water and groundwater. These waters and the degraded minerals 
that result from their production flow into the ocean where a reverse 
reaction to the weathering that produced them occurs.' An ocean of the 
present composition results and new rocks are produced. Man's activities 
and the activities of organisms growing in and around natural waters 
modify both the inorganic a'. i organic composition of all of these 
solutions. 
1.3, METHODS OF EXPRESSING CONCENTRATION 
Several different methods of expressing concentration are commonly 
used in various branches of water chemistry and it is appropriate to 
present these here. This discussion will also provide definitions and 
methods of calculation that will be useful in the later chapters of this 
book. 
1.3.1. Mass Concentration 
There are two basic ways to express the mass concentration of dissolved 
species (solutes) in solution. The first is to state concentration in units of 
mass of solute in a unit volume of solution-the so-called w/v (weight/ 
volume) basis. The second is a w/w basis, that is, weight of solute in a 
given weight of solution.5 Both of these methods of ';xpressing concentra­
tion are widely used in water chemistry. For example, the units mg/liter 
and ppm (parts per million) are, respectively, the w/v and w/w units most 
often used to express the concentration of various materials in waters 
and wastewaters. They can be interconverted if the density of the solution 
is known. 
5 Note: For gaseous constituents in solution or for the various components of a 
mixture of gases, v/v, or the volume of a constituent at standard temperature 
and pressure in a unit volume of solution, is also in common usage. Methods of Expressing Concentration 15 
If the "density of the solution is unity, these two methods of concentration 
expression are identicaL that is, "

tration units are us en interchangeably by practitioners in the field. In 
recent years, however, there has been a tendency to use the mg/liter unit 
rather than ppm. Possibly, this is because the mg!liter method represents 
the way in which most constituents are analyzed, that is, a mass of a 
material in a known volume of solution is analyzed rather than a mass 
of solute in a known mass of solution. However, for the analysis and 
expression of concentration of the constituents of sludges and sediments, 
the mg/kg (ppm) unit is usually used because, in this type of analysis, 
samples are usually weighed out rather than measured out volumetrically. 
In both types of concentration expression the mass component of the 
concentration term can take a variety of forms. The simplest form is when 
specific components of a solution are expressed in terms of the specific 
components themselves, for example, if we were to analyze a solution of 
ammonium nitrate (NH4NO,) for ammonium ion (NH4+) and for nitrate ion 
(NO, -) and find that 100 ml of solution contained 36 mg NH, + and 124 mg 
NO,-, we could compute that the solution contains: 
36 mg NH, + 1000 ml 
100 ml x liter 360 mg NH, +/liter 
and 
124 riJ.g NO, -1000 ml =:.::.:"'-".=c... X 1240 mg NO, -!liter 100 ml liter 
Each component of the solution is expressed as the form in which it 
appears in solution. We can express the components as constituents other 16 Introduction 
than those in which they appear in solution. For example, if we were to

water chemistry, especially for nitrog';;;:pho~rus, and carbon. This 
method is used frequently by oceanographers to express the concentration 
of micronutrients in seawater. The units /Lg.atomsfliter are often found in 
oceanographic literature. For example 1.0 /Lg-atom per liter of phosphate­
phosphorus is 31 /Lg PO,-P/liter, where 31 is the atomic weight of 
phosphorus. It is important to indicate clearly whieh method of concen­
tration expression is being used or considerable errors can result. For 
example, the EPA Drinking Water Standards recommend an upper limit 
on nitrate for public water supplies of 10 mg/liter. In this instance the 
nitrate is expressed as N. If we had read this incorrectly and assumed 
that the standard was stated in terms of mg NO,-fliter, we would be led 
to believe that 
. 14mgNO,-N _ . 10 mg NO,/llter X NO = 2.25 mg NO, -Nlllter 62mg 3 
instead of the 10 mg NO, -Nlliter. 
It is also important to remember that the expression of various constit· 
uents in terms of a common constituent is merely a convenience and has 
nothing to do with the nature of the constituent In a specific water. Often 
people speak of the amount of phosphorus in water or wastewater. There 
is no phosphorus in water or wastewater. If there were, we would be in 
trouble because the water would be unusable for most purposes. But there 
are various types of phosphates, which we analytically express as 
phosphorus. 
1.3.2. Molar Concentration and Activity 
The previous discussion has centered around the topic of expressing 
the mass of constituents either _ as "themselves" or as some common 
constituent for the sake of convenience. More common to chemistry in 
general is the use of molarity, the moles of Holute per volume of solutiQn

text, are based on molar concentrations. This is because the equilibrium

active concentration-that concentration we use in many thermodynamic 
equations-is called the activity of the substance (see Chapter 3). 
1.3.3. Equivalents and Normal Concentration 
The expression of solute concentration as equivalents/liter, that is, 
normal concentration, is based on a definition that is related to the type 
of reaction in which the solution constituents are involved. The advantage 
in using normality is that when two substances react to produce other 
substances, the number of equivalents of each reacting species is equal 
to the number of equivalents of product. Knowing this, many problems 
are easier to solve. Expression of solute concentrations in terms of 
equivalentslliter or normal concentrations requires a knowledge of the 
nature of the reaction being considered. Cases may arise where a single 
substance has two different equivalent weights because of its involvement 
in two different types of reaction. 
A one normal solution of a substance is a solution that contains one 
equivalent weight of a substance per liter of solution. Three methods of 
definition of equivalent weight are commonly encountered in water and 
wastewater chemistry. The methods are those based on (I) the charge of

An acid or a base can have more than one equivalent weight. For 
example, in Example 1-2 the ion CO,'-had an equivalent weight of 30 for 
one reaction and 60 for another, and the normality of two CO,'-solutions, 
each with the same mass concentration of CO,'-, differed by a factor of 
2. In much of the water chemistry literature, CO,'-, and correspondingly 
CaCO" is treated as though it has only one equivalent weight, 50, a 
value that is of one-half the molecular weight. This can be a source of 
confusion, but it can be dealt with if one is aware of it. 
Another type of reaction that may cause some confusion is the combined 
reaction. For example. the reaction 
Ca" + HCO, -;;= CaCO",} + H+ 
is the sum of the acid-base reaction, 
HCO, --> H+ + CO,'­
and the precipitation reaction, 
Ca" + CO,h-> CaCO",} (I-I) 
(1-2) 
(1-3) 
Since Ca'+ participates only in the precipitation reaction, it has.2 
equivalents/mole for reactions I-I and 1-3. However, HCO,-has I equiv­
alent/mole for the acid-base reaction, Eq. 1-2, and 2 equivalents/mole for 
the precipitation step in Eq. 1-1. In Eq. I-I it is the CO,'-within each 
HCO, -that reacts to form the precipitate, and each CO,'-has a charge 
of 2. 
3. Equivalent Weight for Oxidation-Reduction Reactions. For oxidation­
reduction reactions, the equivalent weight is defined as~ of 
~--"""'~~---------------.---'- -'---, -~---~, -'-, .-----.-._--------substance per mole of electrons transferred." On" mole at electrons is 
~-----------.--.-~---- .. -----,-------"-one equivalent of electrons. Thus, in the half reaction for the reduction 
of oxygen to water, 
0, + 4H+ + 4e--> 2H,O 
the equivalent weight of oxygen is 
gram molecular weight Gram equivalent weight = / I 4eqmo e 32 g/mole 8 / = g eq 4 eq/mole Methods of Expressing Concentration 21 
Similarly, for an overall oxidation-reduction reaction, such as the one in 
_ which ferrous ion. Fe2+. is oxidized to ferric ion, Fe3+, by oxygen, 
4Fe'+ + 0, + 4H+ -7 4Fe'+ + 2H,O 
we need to determine the number of electrons transferred per mole of 
species. We do this by separating the overall reaction into half-reactions, 
0, + 4H+ + 4e--7 2H,O 
and 
One mole of Fe2+ or Fe'+ reacts or is produced per mole of electrons so 
that the equivalent weights of each of these species are the same as the 
molecular weights. Note that if Fe'+ and Fe'+ were to participate in a 
precipitation-dissolution reaction, the equivalent weights would be one 
half and one third of the molecular weights, respectively. 
1.3,4, MassNolume Concentrations as 0, 
It is common in water chemistry to express the results of oxidation­
reduction reactions [such as those that take place in the biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD) or chemical oxygen demand (COD) tests] in terms 
of oxygen much the same way that we earlier expressed ammonia and 
nitrate in terms of nitrogen. To do this we assume that in all cases e ch 
mole of o,:,¥gen can accept 4 moles of electrons as in Section 1.3.4. (There 
~----~--------- ~----- ....... -~~~-are other reactions for 0, in which the number of electrons transferred is 
other than 4, but they will not take place under the conditions of interest

The term equivalents-per million, epm. is the w/w version of meq/liter. 
It is a term that was once commonly used but rarely is found in current 
literature; it commonly appears in older literature, especially in geo­
chemistry. Since

1.3.6. Mass Concentration as CaCO, 
A very widespread system for expressing hardness (calcium and 
magnesium) and alkalinity (HCO,-, CO,'-and OH-) concentrations in 
water and wastewater engineering and water chemistry is the calcium 
carbonate system. This method of expressing concentration has the 
identical advantages (and disadvantages) to the "equivalents" method; 
it probably arose because early sanitary engineers were attracted by the 
prospect of normalizing concentrations to CaCO" a substance commonly 
used and referred to in water chemistry. In this method of expression, the 
concentration of a substance as "mg/liter as CaCO," is determined by the 
equation 
Number of equivalents of substance per liter 
x SO X lO'mg CaCO, (1.4) 
equivalent of CaCO, 
The equivalent weight of CaCO, in this system is defined on the basis 
of "charge" or "acid-base reactions" (i.e .. cases I and 2 in Section 1.3.3.). 
For example, for ~dness, 
(1·5) 
Each mole of CaCO, yields I mole, or 2 equivalents of Ca2+. Therefore, 
with respect to Ca'+ in precipitation or dissolution reactions, 
r *-Equivalent weight of CaCO, 100 glmole SO I = geq 2 eq/mole 
Because Mg2+ is also divalent and its properties as a hardness ion are 
based on charge just as are those of Ca'+, we treat Mg2+ the same as 
CaH, 
For the total alkalinity reaction we are concerned with the CO,'-portion 
of CaCO,. 
CaCO, + 2H+ -> H,CO, + Ca2+ (1-6) 
l Additional Reading 23 
and, since 2H+ react per mole of CaCO" for this reaction CaCO, once 
again has an equivalent weight of so. Other bases such as OH-and 
HCO, -are part of alkalinity and react as follows, 
OH-+ H+ -7 H20 
HCO, -+ H+ -7 H2CO; (1·7) 
(1·8) 
Each mole of these bases reacts with 1 mole of H+; therefore, each mole 
contains one equivalent of capacity for reacting with H+ and we convert 
the moleslliter (= eqlliter) of these species to "mglliter as CaCO," again 
as shown in Eq. 1·4. 
Calcium carbonate does not always have an equivalent weight of SO 
g/mole, however. In the following reaction, 
CaCO, + H+ -7 Ca2+ + HCO,-
I mole of CaCO, reacts with I mole of H+. Thus, for this reaction, CaCO, 
has an equivalent weight of lOa g/eq. This point is overlooked in much 
of the water chemistry literature. For this reason the reader should always 
examine the basis used to express concentrations as "mglliter as CaCO,."

KINETICS 
The topic of chemical kinetics deals with the rate and mechanism of 
chemical reactions. The subject is of considerable concern to the aquatic 
chemist because in many instances the rate at which a reaction proceeds 
toward equilibrium. rather than the equilibrium condition. determines 
the design and performance of treatment processes and the behavior of 
natural water systems. 
In water and wastewater treatment. for example. the chemical oxidation 
of organic compounds by chlorine and ozone. the precipitation of calcium 
phosphates. calcium carbonate. and magnesium hydroxide. and the 
chemical oxidation of iron(II) and manganese(I1). are reactions whose 
rates control the design and efficiency of treatment processes.' In natural 
waters, reaction rates control such diverse reactions as precipitation, 
dissolution. and oxidation-reduction and concentrations exist that are not 
those that would be predicted by equilibrium calculations. These none­
quilibrium situations are particularly common for reactions involving 
oxidation-reduction and precipitation-dissolution_ For example. by equi­
librium calculations alone we can predict that it woud be impossible for 
sulfide to exist in water that contained dissolved oxygen. However. data 
collected in South San Francisco Bay in 1962 showed that sulfide could 
be detected in waters that contained up to 3 mg/liter dissolved oxygen.' 
This occurrence is possible because the reaction rate between oxygen 
and sulfide in dilute aqueous sol1:ltion is not rapid. 
The oxidation of Fe(ll) to Fe (III) by molecular oxygen is a reaction that 
equilibrium calculations predict will go to completion in waters where 
dissolved oxygen is present. However. we find that solutions of Fe(II) salts 
at low pH values are stable indefinitely even when a stream of pure 
1 In this chapter we concern ourselves only with systems that are uniform in 
concentration throughout. In process design the degree and type of mixing are 
important in addition to the rate at which chemical species react in uniform 
systems.

Francisco Bay, 1961-62, South San Francisco Bay Area, Suisun Bay-Lower San 
Joaquin River Area, San Pablo Bay Area," SERL Report No. 63-3, 1963, University 
of California, Berkeley, 2nd annual report. Collisions of Reacting Species 25 
oxygen gas is bubbled through them.3 At pH < 4, less than 0.1 percent 
Fe(1I) will oxidize each day. In Fe(1I) solutions with pH values> 7 to 8 the 
rate of oxidation of Fe(1I) to Fe(I1I) is so rapid that it is limited by the rate 
at which oxygen can be supplied by dissolution from the gas phase. In 
this example we see that pH exerts a profound effect on whether 
equilibrium conditions or kinetic considerations better describe the sys­
tem. 
If natural water phosphate levels were controlled by equilibrium of the 
water with the thermodynamically stable calcium phosphate solid­
calcium hydroxyapatite, CasOH(P04j,-phosphate levels would be so low 
that we would not be concerned with phosphate as a nutrient for 
photosynthetic aquatic organisms. However, levels of phosphate exist in 
receiving waters that are far in excess of those predicted by equilibrium 
with hydroxyapatite because, not only is the rate of formation and 
dissolution of this thermodynamically predicted solid slow, but also 
calcium phosphate solids of higher solubility form and then transform 
very slowly into hydroxyapatite. 
The information derived from chemical kinetics should help us under­
stand why, when we mix ·hydrogen and oxygen gases together, there is 
no reaction; yet the presence of a little platinum or a spark in a mixture 
of these two gases will produce water with explosive violence. From our 
investigation of chemical kinetics we should understand why some 
oxidation-reduction reactiops proceed very slowly in the absence of 
microorganisms while in their presence they occur rapidly. For example, 
thermodynamic or equilibrium predictions would lead one to conclude 
that ammonia would be oxidized to nitrate in oxygenated water. Yet an 
aerated sterile solution of ammonium chloride is stable indefinitely. 
However. if we introduce microorganisms of the genre Nitrosornonas and 
Nitrobacter, a rapid conversion of ammonium ion to nitrite and then to 
nitrate will take place. 
In similar fashion for an unoxygenated water in equilibrium with the 
earth's atmosphere, which contains 78 percent nitrogen gas, we would 
predict that nitrate in water should be converted to nitrogen gas. This 
reaction, which is called denitrification. again only takes place in the 
presence of suitable microorganisms. In their absence sodium nitrate 
solutions are perfectly stable. In this chapter and in succeeding chapters 
we will examine the reasons for these observations in an effort to better 
understand the chemistry of aqueous systems. 
2.2. COLLISIONS OF REACTING SPECIES 
With a few exceptions, such as radioactive decay, collisions between 
reacting species are necessary for chemical reactions to occur. Although 
3 W. Stumm and J. J. Morgan. Aquatic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience, 1970, pp. 
534-S38. 26 Chemical Kinetics 
collisions bring the reacting species close enough together for reaction 
to occur, not all collisions successfully produce a chemical reaction. 
Collisions between two species (a bimolecular collision) are a far more 
common occurrence than the simultaneous collision of three (trimolecular) 
or more species. For example, in air at ordinary laboratory conditions, 
where less than 0.1 percent of the gas volume is occupied by gas 
molecules, one molecule hits another (bimolecular collision) approxi­
mately 10' times per second. Three molecules collide simultaneously 
(lrimolecular collision) at a rate of about 10' times per second.4 We can 
reason that on the basis of the much greater frequency of bimolecular 
collisions, it is more likely that these are usually responsible for chemical 
reactions. 
A similar line of reasoning can be followed for substances reacting in 
solution. The number of collisions between species other than the solvent 
in a solution is only slightly greater than in the gas phase.' Thus, for the 
same concentration and temperature, reactions in solution should occur 
at approximately the same rate as in the gas phase. However, reacting 
species, especially ionic species, frequently interact with the solvent, and 
this can significantly affect the rate at which collisions occur. 
Differences between liquid phase reactions and gas phase reactions 
occur largely because of the so-called "cage effect." In a gas phase when 
two reacting species collide and subsequently rebound they can become 
separated by a great distance in a very short period of time. However, in 
solution the solvent molecules that surround the colliding species serve 
to trap them subsequent to collision by immediately colliding with the 
rebounding species. Indeed, in many instances, the reactants are de­
flected so that another collision between the reactants can occur. Because 
of this, successive collisions of the same molecules tend to occur in a 
solvent. 
We can increase the number of collisions between reacting species by 
increasing the temperature. If the reacting medium is a compressible 
gas, we can also increase the number of collisions by increasing the 
pressure. 
2,3. ORIENTATION OF REACTANTS 
Reactions between species that require no special orientation during 
collision to result in a reaction tend to be more rapid than reactions 
between species that must be properly aligned for a collision to result in 
a reaction. This so-called "orientation effect" partially explains why many 
collisions between reacting species are not successful in producing a 
reaction. For example, the spherical Ag+ ion and the spherical CI-ion 
combine very rapidly to form the precipitate AgCl(s) when present in a 
4 J. A. Campbell, Why Do Chemical Reactions Occur? Prentice-Hall. Englewood

supersaturated solution. A very large percentage of the collisions between 
. these species is successful in producing reaction because each is spherical 
and no special orientation is required (Fig. 2-1).

Fig. 2-1. Orientation effect. 
The formation of solid sodium acetate' from supersaturated sodium 
acetate solutions is slow by comparison and the supersaturated solutions 
can exist for long periods of time without a precipitate forming. Many 
collisions between the spherical Na+ ion and the linear CH3COO-(acetate) 
ion occur that do not result in reaction because the only collision that can 
result in reaction is between Na+ and the oxygen end of CH3COO-(Fig. 
2_1).7 A collision between Ncr+ and any other part of the acetate ion cannot 
form a sodium acetate precipitate. 
2.4_ THE RATE LAW 
We can show experimentally that for the general irreversible reaction 
A + 2B + . . . ---> P + 2Q ... 
reactants products 
we can write the rate law. 
where d~~l = -k[Al'[Bl'[P1P[Qlq ... (2-1) 
d~~l = time rate of change in molar concentration of species A. 
k = reaction rate constant, and 
a. b. p. q •... = constants 
6 However, sodium acetate will not precipitate unless the concentrations of Na+ 
and CH3COO-each exceed approximately 15 moles per liter, concentrations far 
in excess of those encountered in dilute aqueous solution. 
, J. A. Campbell. Why Do Chemical Reactions Occur? Prentice-Hall. Englewood 
Cliffs. N.J .. 1965. 28 Chemical Kinetics 
In this book, [ ] is used to signify concentration in moleslliter. We may 
use concentration units other than moleslliter in the rate law but in doing 
so we should use the same concentration unit for each species and realize 
that both the numerical value and units of the reaction rate constant will 
differ from those found when molecular concentrations are used. 
Using our knowledge of the stoichiometry of the reaction, that is, the 
relative number of moles of species reacting and the relativ~ number of 
moles of products being formed as the reaction proceeds, we can state 
that 
d[A] _! d[B] 
dt -2 dt .. _ -d[P] _.=! d[Q] 
-dt -2 dt ... (2.2) 
because I mole of A reacts for every 2 moles of B that react, and so forth, 
and I mole of P is formed for every mole of A that reacts, and so forth. We 
can determine the reaction order from the rate law. The overall reaction 
order is 
a+b+p+q ... (2·3) 
while the order with respect to A is a, the order with respect to B is b, and 
so forth. If the reaction is irreversible, then p, q, .... the exponents of the 
product concentration, are usually zero. For example, if 
d[A] = -k[A][B]' 
dt 
then we would say that the reaction was first order with respect to A, 
second order with respect to B, and third order overall. It is important to 
note that reaction order is generally not determined by the stoichiometry 
of the overall reaction. Laboratory experimentation is necessary to de· 
termine the order. 
The following example illustrates several points that are important for 
a good understanding of the rate law. 
Example 2-1 
Ammonia, NH31 is a common constituent of many natural waters and waste­
waters. It reacts with the disinfectant hypochlorous acid, HOCl, in solution to 
form monochloroamine, NH2CI, as follows. 
I. NH, + HOCI --> NH,CI + H,O 
The rate constant, k, was found by experiment to be 5.1 x 106 (liters/mole

When x and yare each reduced by 50 percent. the reaction rate becomes 
(d[HOC1J)

The new reaction rate is 2S percent of the initial reaction rate. 
c. When the concentrations of HOCl and NH3 are both expressed as molelliter, 
the rate constant can be written, 
(l) k ~ d[HOC1Jldt (1 ) (I) 
[NH,][HOCl] [NH,J t 
Setting k' = rate constant when concentrations are expressed in mg!

Since 1 mole NH,lliter ~ 17,000 mg NH,lliter, 
(3) mg NH,lliter ~ [NH,J x 17,000 30 Chemical Kinetics

Integrated forms of the rate law are very useful for analyzing rate data 
to determine reaction rate constants and reaction order. Let Us first 
consider the irreversible reaction 
which has the rate law A --> products 
d[A] = -k[A]n 
dt 
To determine the behavior of [A] as a function of time, we must integrate 
the rate expression with respect to time. We will do thisfor several values 
of the reae!ion order. n. When n = 0, the reaction is zero order. and 
d[A] - = -k[A]O = -k dt 
Upon integrating. we obtain 
[A] = [A]o -kt (2.4) 
(2·5) 
where [A]o = the concentration of A at t = 0, that is, the initial concentration 
of A. The half-life, t1{" or time for 50 percent of the initial concentration 
to react can be obtained from Eq. 2-5 by setting [A] = 0.5 [A]o when t = 
t 1{2' Then 
·0.5[A]o t'12=-k--
When n = 1. the reae!ion is first order, both with respee! to A and 
overall. and we can write. 
d[A] = -k[A] 
dt 
Rearranging Eq. 2-6 and solving the integral.

[AI, [A] ° (2-6) The Rate Law 31 
we find 
In [AJ = In [AJa -kl (2-7) 
or 
[AJ= [AJa e-kt (2-8) 
Examination of Eq. 2-7 suggests that the rate constantk may be determined 
experimentally from a plot of In [AJ versus t. which has a slope of -k. 
Also. from Eq. 2-8, when [AJ = 0.5 [AJa, we find the half-life to be

and the half-life is

1'12 =.k[AJa 
For a second-order reaction involving one reactant, we would determine 
the rate constant k by plotting II[AJ versus I to yield a straight line with 
a slope of k in accordance with Eq. 2-11. 
Let us now proceed to the slightly more complex case of the irreversible 
reaction in which two reactants react to give products. We can write 
A + B -> products (2-12) .--;".~ 32 Chemical Kinetics 
which has the rate law 
d[A] = d[B] = -k[A]'[B]b 
dt dt (2.13) 
When a = I and b = I, the reaction is second order overall and first order 
with respect to both A and B, There are two general situations we must 
examine, These are when [A]o = [B]o, and when [A]oi' [B]o' For the first 
case, 
d[A] = -k[A][B] 
dt (2· 14) 
From the reaction stoichiometry in Eq. 2·12, we can see that for each 
molecule of A which reacts, one molecule of B will react. The concentra· 
tions of A and B will therefore decrease at the same rate, and since they 
were initially equal this means they will always be equal. We can 
therefore substitute [A] for [B] to give 
d[A] = -k[A]' 
dt (2.15) 
which, when integrated, will yield the same expression as Eq. 2·11. 
When a = b = I and [A]o = [B]o, it is useful to use the substitution 
[A] = [A]o-X 
[B] = [B]o -X (2·16) 
(2.17) 
where X is the concentration in moleslliter of each species that has 
reacted. Differentiating Eq. 2·16, we obtain 
From Eq. 2.14, 
or dX d[A] -=---dt dt 
d[A] = -k[A][B] 
dt . 
dX = -d[A] = k[A][B] 
dt dt (2.18) 
(2·19) 
and substituting for [A] and [B] from Eqs. 2·16 and 2·17 in Eq. 2.19, we 
obtain 
dX cit = k([A]o -X)([B]o -X) (2.20) 
Integrating, rearranging, and substituting for X from Eqs. 2·16 and 2·17, 
we obtain The Rate Law 33 
In l!ll = In [B], + ([B] -[A] ) kt (2-21) 
[A] [A], '.' 
A plot of experimental data in the form In ([B]/[A]) versus t will yield a 
straight line with a slope of ([B], -[A],)k, and since [B], and [A], are 
known, k can be determined as k = slope/([B], -[A],). It is important to 
note that Eq. 2-21 is only yalid for the reaction stoichiometry given in Eq. 
2-12. If the stoichiometry is different, the integrated form of the rate law 
will also be different. For example, for the reaction 
2A + B "'"' prod ucts 
For the initial condition of [A], = 2[B], and a rate law of 
d[B] = -k[A]'[B] 
dt 
the integrated form of the rate expression is 
I I 
[B]' = [B],' + Skt (2-22) 
(2-23) 
(2-24) 
To obtain k from experimental data for a reaction that follows this rate 
law, we must plot 1/[B]' versus t and obtain the slope which is equal to 
Sk. Then k = slope/So 
One other reaction order will be considered here, namely the pseudo 
fjrst-order reaction. The reaction 
which has the rate law A + B "'"' products 
d[A] = -k[A][B] 
dt (2-25) 
(2-26) 
can be treated as a first-order reaction if one of the reactants is present 
in such excess that its concentration is virtually unchanged during the 
course of the reaction. For example, if reactant B is present in large 
excess over reac"tant A, then 
d[A] = -k[A][B] = -k'[A] 
dt (2-27) 
where k' = k[B] and k' is a pseudo first-order reaction rate constant. This 
equation can be integrated to give 
[A] = [A],e-k't (2-2S) 
When reactions taking place in dilute aqueous solution have water as 
one of the reactants, it is often possible to assume that the water is 
present in large excess. For example, the hydrolysis of one molecule of 
the disaccharide sucrose to yield two molecules of monosaccharides (one 34 Chemical Kinetics 
molecule each of glucose and fructose) can be written as 
H20 + C12H22011 ~ C6H1206 + C6H1206 
sucrose glucose fructose 
Experiments show this reaction to be second order overall, but because 
the H20 concentration remains essentially constant in dilute aqueous 
solution it can be considered as a pseudo first·order reaction. 
A common experimental technique used in the study of reaction rates 
is to make each of the reactants in turn present in large excess. The 
dependence of the reaction rate on the concentration of the other reactants 
can then be studied. 
In each of the situations already discussed, we assumed that the 
reactions were irreversible, that is, once products formed. no -reverse 
reaction to form the reactants occurred. Very few reactions are strictly 
irreversible; however, we can make use of the equations applicable to 
irreversible reactions by controlling the reaction conditions used to collect 
rate data so that the assumption of irreversibility can legitimately be 
made. One way of doing this is to collect rate data only during a very 
short time period following the mixing of reactants. Even if the reaction 
is reversible there will be little back reaction during this time period 
because the products that participate in the back reaction are present 
only in small quantities. 
The following example illustrates a procedure for determining the 
reaction order and rate constant. The reader is referred to other texts (see 
Section 2·10, Additional Reading) for procedures on handling more com· 
plex problems and for a more detailed treatment of the topic of rate 
equations. 
Example 2-2 
Hydrogen peroxide. H202t is an oxidizing agent that often finds use in water 
purification processes. It readily decomposes to oxygen and water in the presence 
of a manganese dioxide catalyst (see Section 2-7). Given that the reaction is 
irreversible. we find that

Determine the rate constant and order of this reaction. 
Solution 
The data in Table 2-1 were obtained during an experiment to determine the rate 
constant and order of the reaction. First. let us test whether the reaction is first 
or second order. For a first-order reaction the plot of In [H202J! versus t should he 
straight line while for a second-order reaction the plot of 1/[H2021 versus t should 
be linear. Figure 2-2 shows that In [H,O,] versus t is linear and j/[H,O,] versus t 
is curvilinear. Thus the reaction can be treated as first order with respect to H202• The Rate Law 35

This trial-and-error approach to finding reaction order has definite 
limitations because (I) it is difficult to apply if the reaction order is not 
an integer, and (2) the scatter of data points owing to experimental error 
makes it difficult to judge whether the straight line fit for one assumed 
order is better than another. Most reaction orders are integers, however, 
and if the data are carefully collected and the experiment is properly 
designed, the procedure gives fairly reliable results. (The data used in 
this example were collected by one of us when he was an undergraduate. 
Thus, while the design of the experiment was most likely well done, the 
reader is left to judge for himself whether the data were carefully 
collected. ) 
2,5. REACTION MECHANISM 
We have noted previously that the order of a reaction cannot necessarily 
be determined from an examination of the stoichiometry of the reaction. 
Indeed we can define a particular type of reaction-the elementary 
reaction-which has the special property that its reaction order can be 
determined from its stoichiometry. Elementary reactions may be mon­
omolecular, where a single species reacts and its concentration alone 
determines the rate of the reaction. Generally stated, if the reaction A -> 
products is elementary and monomolecular, the rate law will be 
d[A] = -k[A] 
dt 
Radioactive decay is an example of such a reaction as is the decomposition 
of the gas cyclopropane to propylene, 
CH, -CH, ... CH, -CH = CH, '-/ CH, 
Elementary reactions that are bimolecular involve the interaction of 
two molecules which may be two molecules of the same species or 
molecules of different species. Thus 
A + A'"-~ products 
or 
A + B -> products 
The rate laws are, respectively, 
and d[A] = -k[A]' 
dt Reaction Mechanism 37 
d[A] = d[B] = -k[A][B]

Examples of such reactions are the decomposition of nitrogen dioxide to 
nitric oxide and oxygen in the gas phase.

and the formation of iodomethane from bromomethane. 
CH3Br + 1- CH31 + Be 
bromomethane iodide iodomethane bromide 
d[CH,Br] 
dt d~;] = -k[CH 3Br]W] 
More complex reactions than these are the rule rather than the exception. 
Overall reactions, when written stoichiometrically, may lead one to 
believe that they have simple mechanisms. However, experimentation 
may well reveal a complicated rate law that indicates a complex mech· 
anism. 
For example, contrast the following two reactions: The formation of 
hydrogen iodide from hydrogen gas and iodine gas is stoichiometrically 
represented as 
The reaction is elementary, bimolecular and first order with respect to 
both [I"g)] and [H"g)]' The rate law is 
I d[RI] -d[I,] -d[H,] 2& = ~ = dt = k[H"g)][I"g)] 
The formation of hydrogen bromide from hydrogen gas and bromine gas 
can be stoichiometrically stated as 
H2(g) + Br2(g) ~ 2HBr(g) 
The rate law is found by experiment to be 
! d[HBr] = k[H"g)][Br"g)l''' 
2 dt I + k' [HBr,g)]/[Br"g)] 
The reaction is evidently not elementary. Such complex reactions as 
these, however, are composed of a series or a sequence of elementary 
reactions. We can determine the reaction order with respect to each 
reactant (and product) and the influence of the concentration of all species 38 Chemical Kinetics 
on the rate of the overall reaction if we know the sequence and rates of 
the elementary reactions that make up the overall reaction. 
To illustrate these points further, let us examine the results from a 
biochemical experiment in which the rate of hydrolysis of sucrose by the 
enzyme saccharase is investigated. This enzyme, or biological catalyst 
(of which we shall speak in more detail later), catalyzes the reaction: 
saccharase 
C12H22011 + H20 ~ C,H120, + C,H120, 
sucrose glucose fructose 
The data of Kuhn' showed that the initial rate of hydrolysis of the substrate 
sucrose (-d[S]/dt) was a function of the substrate concentration [S] when 
the saccharase enzyme concentration [E] was constant (Fig. 2-3). At low 
substrate concentrations the rate of hydrolysis appeared to be proportional 
to sucrose concentration, that is, -d[S]/dt = k[S], while at higher sucrose 
concentrations the rate of hydrolysis approached a maximum rate that 
was apparently independent of sucrose concentration, that is, -d[S]/dt 
= constant. 
This rate behavior can be rationalized by assuming that the sucrose 
and enzyme react to form a complex which then may either revert to 
sucrose and enzyme or react to form the products, [P], glucose, and 
fructose. The reaction scheme proposed is 
kJ k3 
S + E;;=:ES;;=:P ... + E 
k2 k4 (2-29) 
We can reason that the rate of reaction should be related to the concen­
tration of ES complex because, for the reaction to take place, ES must be 
formed. Our first step will be to determine ES in terms of the total amount 
of E-containing species and substrate concentration. 
When the reaction depicted in Eq. 2-29 is at steady state, d[ES]/dt = 0, 
and 
Rate of ES formation = rate of ES removal 
Thus, because the reactions in Eq. 2-29 are elementary, 
k,[E][S] + k,[E][P] = k2[ES] + k3[ES] 
Dividing through by [E] and rearranging yields 
[E] = (k2 + k3) 
[ES] k,[S] + k,[P] 
Assuming k ,[P] « k 1[S] and defining the total amount of enzyme as [E], 
= [E] + [ES], we can derive the expression,

[EJ, [SJ 
[ESJ = [(k, + k,)lk,J + [SJ 
If we now assume that the rate of reaction, V, is proportional to [ESJ, 
then the maximum rate of reaction V m" will occur when all of the enzyme 
is present as [ESJ, when [ESJ [EJ,. Further, if we set Km = (k, + k,)lk" we obtain .. 
V = Vm" [SJ 
Km + [SJ (2-30) 
A plot of V versus [SJ using this expression, the Michaelis-Menten 
equation, gives a rectangular hyperbola---<l curve of the form depicted in 
Fig, 2-3. This lends support to the contention that our kinetic model is 
descriptive of the reaction mechanism, 
As we shall see later in this chapter, this rectangular hyperbolic 
expression provides a useful model for microbial growth kinetics, At this 
point we should examine the two constants that determine the shape of 
the V versus [SJ curve. The value of V m" is the maximum rate of reaction, 
that is, the rate attained at high values of [SJ, When V m" is reached, 
further increases in [SJ have no effect on reaction rate, 
When [SJ > > Km, analysis of Eq, 2-30 shows that V = V m,,' The reaction 
then is zero order with respect to [SJ, a property that agrees with one of 40 Chemical Kinetics 
our initial experimental observations. The value of Km is equal to the 
value of [8] when V = V m,,12. We call this value of the substrate 
concentration [8],/2 (see Fig. 2-3). This can be shown using Eq. 2-3. If V = 
V m,,/2 and [8] =[8]112' for example. 
V max = V max [8]"2 
2 Km + [8],/2 
or Km = [8],/2 
This constant. Km. is variously called the half-velocity constant. the 
Michaelis-Menten constant. and is indicative of the strength of the bond 
between enzyme and substrate. The lower the value of Km. the greater is 
the affinity hetwe"n enzyme and substrate. Values of Km for single 
substrate-enzyme reactions are generally between 10-2 and 10-5 M. The 
significance of this range of values is that it only requires 10-5 to 10-2 M 
of substrate to allow an enzyme to operate at half of its maximum rate. 
In the substrate concentration range where K m » [8]. Eq. 2-30 predicts 
that 
V = V m" [8] = K' [8] 
Km 
This is the expression for a reaction which is first order with respect to 
[8]. an expression that fits the experimentally observed behavior in Fig. 
2-3. Thus we see that the same reaction can be either zero or first order 
depending on the concentration of reactants. 
2.6. EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON REACTION RATE 
Experiments have shown that chemical reaction rates increase with 
increasing temperatures.10 In many instances, the effect of temperature 
on reaction rate is related to its effect on the reaction rate constant. 
Arrhenius formulated the empirical rate law. 
k = Ae(-EafRn 
Equation 2-31 can be linearized as follows. 
Ink =lnA _ E, Rr (2-31) 
(2-32) 
10 One exception is the effect of temperature on enzymatically catalyzed reactions. 
Rather than show a consistent increase with increasing temperature, these 
reactions have temperature optima. Above a certain temperature the structure 
of the enzyme becomes altered (denaturation) and its catalytic properties are 
reduced and eventually destroyed. Effect of Temperature on Reaction Rate 41 
so thai a plot of In k versus liT should give, a straight line with a slope 
of -E,IR and an intercept on the liT axis of In (A)/(E,IR), 
where 
A = the pre-exponential factor, or frequency factor, and is usually 
treated as a constant that is independent of temperature for a 
particular reaction, 
E, = the activation energy and is also treated as a constant for a 
particular reaction 
R = the ideal gas constant 
T = the temperature in 'K 
It is possible to relate the experimentally observed and empirically 
stated effect of temperature on reaction rate to a theoretical description 
of the effect of temperature on the energy level distribution of reacting 
species. To do this, we assume that the reaction 
A + B ..... products 
proceeds through a high-energy, unstable intermediate known as a 
transition complex or an activated complex 
A + B ..... activated complex 
activated complex -) products 
We can illustrate the relative average energy levels of reactants, products, 
and activated complex by a diagram such as that presented in Fig. 2-4. 
Figure 2-4 shows that the complete reaction proceeds, in this example, 
with a release of energy, ilH. However, the intermediate formation of the 
activated complex requires the input of an average amount of energy E" 
the activation energy of the forward reaction. This energy, as well as ilH, 
the heat of reaction, is released when the activated complex decomposes 
Reactants Activated 
complex 
Extent of reaction 
Fig. 2-4. Activation energy. Products 42 Chemical Kinetics 
into the products of the reaction. For the reverse of this reaction to 
proceed. an energy input of (fl.H + E,) is required to form the activated 
complex of which only E, is released when A and B are reformed. The 
quantity (fl.H + E ,) is the activation energy of the reverse reaction. 
Figure 2·4 is based on the average energy levels of reactants. products. 
and the activated complex. To understand how the idea of a high.energy 
activated complex is related to the effect of temperature on the reaction 
rate, we must examine the distribution of energy levels in a reactant at 
a given temperature (see Fig. 2.5). 
The effect of temperature on the distribution of energy levels for a given 
species can be described by the Maxwell·Boltzmann theory. which relates 
the variation of the number of molecules with an energy equcll to or 
greater than a given energy level to the absolute temperature. Thus 
N =NoD exp (;:) 
where 
E = a stipulated energy level (see Fig. 2·5) 
No = total number of molecules 
N = number of molecules with energy equal to or greater than E 
R = gas constant 
T = absolute temperature. OK 
D = constant (2·33) 
From this equation and from Fig. 2·5 we can see that. for a given 
temperature. the value of N will decrease as the value of E is increased. 
Simply stated. as the stipulated energy level is raised. a smaller and 
smaller fraction of the total molecules are included in N. 
Further examination of Eq. 2·33 reveals that for a given energy level. 
increasing the temperature should exponentially increase the population 
of molecules present at or above this energy level. 
We can now postulate that only molecules with an energy level equal 
to or greater than E are capable of forming the high energy·level transition 
complex. Making this postulate draws our attention to the similarity

empirically derived Arrhenius equation." 
The procedure for determining the values of E, and A for a reaction is 
illustrated in the following example.

among molecules in a solution. See 1. A. Campbell, Why Do Chemical Reactions

2.7. CATALYSIS 
Catalysts are substances that increase the rate of reaction. They act by 
modifying the reaction pathway or the nature of the activated complex so 
that the reaction may proceed through an activated complex with a lower 
activation energy (Fig. 2-7). 
For example, we can show that if the rate of a reaction (at 25'C) is 
increased by a factor of two upon the addition of a catalyst. the activation 
energy is reduced by 409 cal/mole. With no catalyst.

Thus E, is decreased by 0.409 kcal/mole. 
Although there is a change in E, attributable to the presence of a 
catalyst the heat of the reaction, t.H, is not altered. We can therefore 
deduce that a catalyst will only influence the rate of a reaction, not its 
extent. A catalyst may participate in the reaction by, for example, 
becoming part of the activated complex. Its concentration is not changed 
by the overall reaction, that is, 
A + B + ~atalyst = products + catalyst 
Catalysts may be generally classified as homogeneous when the· 
catalyst is uniformly distributed on a molecular level throughout the 
reacting medium, or heterogeneous when the catalyst is present as a 
distinctly separate phase. B9th types of chemical catalysts as well as the 
specific biological catalysts known as enzymes are important in aquatic 
chemistry. 
Hydrogen ion (H+) and hydroxyl ion (OH-) are common catalysts in 
aquatic systems. The effect of their catalysis is manifested by changes 
in reaction rate that occur with changes in pH. For example, one of the 
major constituents of household synthetic detergents is the salt of con· 
densed phosphoric acid such as pyrophosphoric acid, H,P,O" and tripo. 
Iyphosphoric acid, HsP,O". These compounds react with water in a 
reaction known as hydrolysis to form orthophosphoric acid thus:

phosphates do not perform this complexing function as well as the 
condensed phosphates, so it is important that the condensed phosphates 
are stable (i.e .. do not undergo hydrolysis as in Eqs. 2-34 and 2-35) during 
the cleansing process. The hydrolysis of condensed phosphates is cata­
lyzed by H+. As Fig. 2-8 shows, the time for 5 percent hydrolysis of a 
pyrophosphate solution at 10°C is about I year at pH 4, many years at pH 
7, and over a century at pH 10. In the typical washing machine environment 
of 65°C and pH 9, a 5 percent decomposition of pyrophosphate would take 
several days so that in the typical wash cycle of 10 to IS min, hydrolysis 
will be insignificant. 
The rate equation for the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate is -d[P,O,'-j/dt 
= k[P,O,'-j. The rate constant is highly dependent on [H+j and varies 
from 0.S34/hr at pH = 0 to 0.0318 at pH = 1.1 to 0.00272lhr at pH 3.3. Most 
domestic wastewaters have pH values in the range 6.5 to 8 and temper­
atures between 10 to 20'C. From Fig. 2-8 we would predict that pyro­
phosphates would be quite stable under these conditions. However, we 
observe that much of the condensed phosphate in domestic wastewater 
has reverted to orthophosphate by the time that the wastewater reaches 
the treatment plant. usually a time period of significantly less than I day. 
Moreover, no condensed phosphates ever survive biological waste treat­
ment processes-<lgain a maximum period of about I day. The reason for 
these observations is again catalysis but in this instance catalysis by 
enzymes. Most microorganisms possess an enzyme (a specific biological 
catalyst) that will mediate the hydrolysis of inorganic condensed phos­
phates. An example of such an enzyme is pyrophosphate phosphohydro­
lase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate to 2 
moles of orthophosphate. 
The effiCiency with which aeration devices transfer oxygen to water or 
to wastewater is measured by determining the rate at which the device 
increases the dissolved oxygen concentration of the liquid. Prior to the 
test, the liquid under investigation must be deoxygenated. The recom­
mended method" for accomplishing deoxygenation is to add sodium 
sulfite, Na,SO" which reacts with oxygen to form sodium sulfate, Na,SO" 
thus: . 
2S0,'-+ 0, :;=: 2S0,'-
thereby depleting the solution of dissolved oxygen. This reaction is 
extremely slow in the absence of a catalyst. It takes about 10 minutes to

A further example of catalysis by metal ions is the effect of cupric ion, 
Cu2+, on the oxidation of cyanide- by ozone.14 In wastes from industries 
such as metal plating and coal carbonization, cyanide can be oxidized 
to cyanate by ozone.

ozone concentration is 
It shows no dependence on Cu2+ concentration above a certain minimum 
concentration indicating that its effect is purely catalytic. The fractional 
order of the reaction indicates a complex mechanism. 
An example of heterogeneous catalysis related to the field of water 
chemistry is the use of cobaltic oxide (Co,O.) catalyst in the determination 
of organic carbon. The Beckman Model 900 carbon analyzer consists of a 
quartz tube heated to 950'C, containing asbestos that has been impreg. 
nated with cobalt nitrate. At 950'C the cobalt nitrate decomposes to 
cobaltic oxide. A sample of 20 ILl is injected into a stream of oxygen that 
passes over the heated catalyst that enhances the oxidation of organic 
carbon to CO,. The CO, concentration is determined by an infrared 
detector. 
2.8. EMPIRICAL RATE LAWS 
Our discussion up to this point has dealt with the use of kinetics to 
describe the rates of chemically well·defined reactions and to explore the 
mechanism of reactions. Kinetic formulations can be used in what one 
might call the opposite sense-that is, to provide an empirical mathe· 
matical framework in which data from complex reactions can be analyzed. 
The objective here is a simplification of complex situations, not the 
discovery of exact mechanism from kinetic analysis. Two examples of 
this use of kinetic formulations that are relevant to aquatic systems will 
be given here. The first concerns treatment of data from the ~ 
oxygen demand (BOD test tha~yariously to_c:l",~~~_e."~h

In the BOD test, a diluted sample of wastewater is incubated for a 
period (5 days at 20'C in the standard BOD, test) and the amount of 
dissolved oxygen consumed in this time period is measured. The BOD, 
is then calculated as 
BOD = dissolved oxygen (mglliter) 
, dilution factor

where dilution factor = volume sample!(volume of sample + volume

Tl1elfc5D;measurement determines only one point on the curve that Empirical Rate Laws 49

mgtte.r. It must be recognized that this is a totally empirical statement 
because the nature of the degradable organic matter in wastewater is not 
well·defined and certainly the individual microbial degradation rates of 
all organic compounds in water are not known. Nevertheless, the overall 
time course of the consumption of oxygen for degradation of carbonaceous 
organic matter in the BOD test has many of the characteristics of a first· 
order reaction. Since the rate of BOD exertion (or organic matter degra. 
dation) is of importance in waste treatment plant design and receiving 
water management, we can usefully employ the empirical first·order 
relationship to formulate the "BOD curve" (see Fig. 2·9).

Because L cannot be measured directly, the equation must be modified 
to replace L with a parameter that can be measured as a function of time. 
We can achieve this modification by setting . 
y =Lo-L (2-38) 
where ~~igJ~~~h!l.e~.t..9&~,

The value of y can be assessed by determining dissolved oxygen 
consumption at any time, through measurements of (Iissolved oxygen

Substituting Eq. 2·38 in Eq. 2.37, we obtain 
Lo - L = y = Lo -Loe-kt 
or (2-39) 
y = Lo(l -e-kt) (2-40) ~ 
which is the classical first-order empirical rate equation for BOD. 
Various procedures exist for analyzing y versus t data to obtain the 
constants k and Lo. One of these, the Thomas slope method, is presented 
here.'s This procedure involves developing a straight line equation that 
approximates the relationship of y and t. 
If we expand the (1 -e-kt) portion of Eq. 2-40, we obtain 
I -e-kt = kt [I -kt + (kt)' -(kt)' + ... J (2-41) 
2 6 24 
The quantity [kt(i + kt/6)-'] has a similar expansion, 
kt (I + kt)-' =kt (1-kt + (kt)' _ (kt)" + ... ) 
6 2 6 21.6 (2-42) 
Comparing these two expansions, we see that a minor difference appears 
only in the fourth term; on this basis we can say 
Lo (1 -e'-kt) '" Lo [ kt ( I + ~t) -'J (2-43) 
or 
(2-44)

With experimental data relating y and time, we can plot (1Iy)'/3 versus 
time. However, experimental values of y > O.9Lo should not be used in 
fitting the straight line because Eq. 2·42 is significantly different from Eq. 
2-41 in this range. Fitting the plot with a straight line and determining 
the intercept, a, and the slope, b, Eqs. 2·47 and 2·48 can be used to give 
k and L~ The following example illustrates the procedure. 
We must be careful to bear in mind as we proceed with these calculations 
that they are empirically based. It is neither wise nor proper to read any 
more significance into them than that; it is certainly improper to infer, as 
many have done, that we" can deduce anything about the reaction 
mechanism from these calculations. 
Example 2-4 
Standard Methods 16 states that the rate constant (base 10) for the oxygen uptake 
of a mixture of glucose (150 mg/liter) and glutamic acid (150 mg/liter) should be 
between 0.16 to D.IS/day when proper seeding with microorganisms is practiced. 
The data in Table 2-2 were obtained at 20°C on a candidate seed material by a 
University of California graduate student. Does the seed satisfy the above

and the growth of algae on nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate. The

The relationship, expressed in Eq. 2-50, bears a striking resemblance 
to the Michaelis-Menten expression developed previously for enzyme 
substrate interaction. Indeed, some workers believe that the analogy is 
not coincidental, stating,that microorganisms are 'bags full of enzymes' 
so that it is not surprising that their growth rate is related to the behavior 
of the catalysts that mediate the many reactions that contribute to growth. 
The growth-rate-substrate relationship is expressed empirically in 
applications such as biological wastewater treatment. In these processes 
we grow a mixed and variable population of microorganisms (e.g .. 
activated sludge) on a mixed and variable substrate (e.g .. domestic 
sewage). We have the same problem that arose in attempting to assess 
the kinetics of the BOD reaction. We do not have a definitive measure of 
growth-limiting substrate concentration, Neither do we have a well­
defined measurement of microorganism concentration. Without going into 
the rationale for their selection, the parameter used for microorganisms 
is usually the mass of suspended solids or the mass of volatile suspended 
solids in the activated sludge suspension, For growth-limiting substrate 
we usually use BOD or COD concentration, These parameters are readily 
measured, but they are collective parameters that indicate rather than 
specify exactly what we should be measuring. As a consequence the 
empirical nature of the microbial growth expression is comp6unded. In 
spite of this, however, the expression has useful appltcation in the design 
and prediction of performance of biological waste treatment plants. For 
example, the data in Fig, 2-11 show the relationship between the growth 
rate and substrate concentration, expressed as soluble COD, for an 
activated sludge unit operated on a protein/beef extract substrate, The 
growth rate is a first-order function of the degradable organic matter 
concentration, We can see that for the range of conditions studied, there

region where K, » [S] and M = k'[S]. Such an observation is indeed 
commonplace for activated sludge systems treating wastewaters at the 
practically employed rates of treatment. The curve in Fig. 2-11 would 
allow us to state that if we wished to produce an effluent with a soluble 
COD of less than 20 mglliter from the activated sludge treatment of this 
waste, we should design the treatment plant to accommodate an activated 
sludge growth rate of less than about 1.2/day, Problems 55

EQUILIBRIUM 
3.1. INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter we will describe methods that will allow us to anSwer 
the questions "Will this reaction go?" and, if so, "How far can it proceed?" 
These are extremely important questions to pose prior to setting about 
the investigation of any chemical or biochemical system. If a reaction is 
impossible, there is absolutely no sense whatsoever in attempting to 
determine its rate, its mechanisnl, or its use in a water or waste treatment 
process. If, for example, you were to be approached by a salesman trying 
to sell you a chemical that would prevent carbon dioxide and nitrogen 
from combining with chloride to form dangerous hydrogen cyanide and 
hypochlorous acid during treatment of a particular wastewater, you could. 
by using techniques similar to those developed in this chapter, tell him 
that the reaction was not possible with or without the chemical and send 
him on his way. And you couid do this conclusively without conducting 
a single experiment! 
The techniques we will develop are based on the branch of science 
known as thermodynamics. The theoretical aspects of thermodynamics 
are extremely precise and orderly; its mathematical basis is complex. 
We, however, are only interested in what thermodynamics can do for us 
as a tool in solving problems of chemical equilibrium. We are in a 
situation similar to the automobile driver using a road map. Not many 
drivers thoroughly understand the principles of geometry and plane 
trigonometry that were used to draw the map. However, most know how 
to read a map and in doing so could manage reasonably well to get from 
Urbana to Berkeley. 
3.2. THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
Let us examine the hypothetical. elementary, reversible reaction taking 
place at constant temperature, 
aA + bB ;;=! cC + dD (3.1) 
The reactants A and B combine to form the products C and D. In this 
reaction, a moles of A combine with b moles of B to form c moles of C and 
d moles of D. If we were to introduce A and B into a suitable reaction ra)

vessel and at time intervals analyze the contents of the reaction vessel, 
we would obtain a concentration versus time profile such as in Fig. 3·I(a). 
The concentrations of A and B decrease until they reach values that do 
not change with time, while the concentrations of C and D increase from 
zero to time-invariant values. If we were to add only the products of the 
reaction, C and D, to the reaction vessel under the same experimental 
conditions, we would obs~rve a concentration·time change such as that 
depicted in Fig. 3.I(b). After a while A, B, C, and D concentrations all 
reach constant, time·invariant levels. If the ratio of the concentration of 
products to reactants, [C]'[D]d/[A]'[B]b is the same as that attained in the 
previous experiment when A and B were initially present, we say that the 
reaction is at equilibrium cmd we call the concentrations of species 
present at thai time equilibrium concentrations. The ratio is the so·called 
equilibrium constant, K. 
[C]'[D]d 
[A]'[B]b = K (3.2) 
The unit of concentration as indicated by [ ] is molelliter, but other 
concentration units also .can be used.' From this discussion we learn that 
the equilibrium state can be approached from both directions. 
When we investigate the rate at which the equilibrium condition is 
approached, we can deduce that the equilibrium condition is a dynamic 
one, not a static situation. The interaction of reactants and products does 
not cease when equilibrium is reached. The forward and reverse reactions 
proceed at such a rate that the ratio of concentrations of products to 
reactants (as described by the equilibrium constant, Eq. 3.2), remains 
constant. Another way of stating this is that a chemical reaction is at 
equilibrium if its forward rate of reaction, v (, is equal to the rate of the 
reverse reaction, v,. For example, we have seen previously in Chapter 2 
1 Strictly speaking, the equilibrium constant is defined in terms of activity, or 
active concentrations, as discussed later in this chapter. Concentration, such 
as the molar concentration, often can be used as a good approximation of 
activity for species in dilute aqueous solutions. 60 Chemical Equilibrium 
that if the reaction in Eq. 3-1 is elementary, the forward rate of reaction, 
v r,. can be expressed by the rate law, 
vr = k,[A]'[B]b (3-3) 
and the reverse rate by v" 
v, = k2[C)'[D]d (3-4) 
Initially, if only A and B are present, the forward rate of reaction will 
proceed at a finite rate while there will be no reverse reaction because 
no C and D are present. However, as soon as the reaction of A and B 
produces C and D, they will combine, and by the reverse reaction produce 
A and B. The reaction will proceed until the opposing reaction rates are 
equal, and 
Vf=V r (3-5) 
Therefore, 
k,[A]'[B]b = k2[C)'[D]d (3-6) 
and 
[C]'[D]d k, 
[A]' [B]b = k2 = K (3-7) 
The equilibrium constant is thus the ratio of the rate constants of the 
forward and the reverse reactions--<I fact that underscores the dynamic 
nature of equilibrium! 
3.3. THE THERMODYNAMIC BASIS OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
A knowledge of the position of chemical equilibria is of the utmost 
importance to us in water chemistry. By knowing the position of chemical 
equilibria, we can determine whether it is possible for certain reactions 
between reactants at given concentrations to proceed. For example, we 
can provide answers to questions such as: Will calcium carbonate tend 
to precipitate or dissolve in this water? Can I possibly oxidize sulfide 
with nitrate? and so on. There are two general ways to answer questions 
like these. The first is to do an experiment and the second is to calculate 
the answer using previously determined equilibrium data. Although the 
first way may be more enjoyable to those who like puttering around in 
the laboratory, the second approach is far superior if time is of the 
essence. 
To explore the various techniques that can be used to answer the 
2 If the chemical reaction is not elementary, derivation of K from rate constants 
is still possible but is more complex. See. e.g., T. S. Lee, in Treatise on 
Analytical Chemistry, I. M. Kolthoff, and P. J. Elving, eds .. Part I, Vol. I, Wiley. 
Interscience, New York. 1959. The Thermodynamic Basis of Chemical Equilibrium 61 
question "Will this reactien ge?" we must delve a little into. the therme­
dynamic basis ef equilibrium. Our treatment. ef thermedynamics will be 
brief; we will present enly that which is useful and immediately applicable 
for our purpose. For a more comprehensive coverage of the topic, the 
student is referred to. ether texts (see Sectien 3-7). 
Mest ef the reactiens with which we are cencerned in water chemistry 
take place in a clesed system er can be analyzed as theugh they take 
place in a clesed system. Fer thermedynamic purpeses a clesed system 
is ene to. which matter cannet be added er remeved. Energy, hewever, 
may flew across its beundaries. Since, in additien to. werking with clesed 
systems, we usually are interested in systems at censtant temperature 
and pressure, we can make extensive use ef the thermedynamic expres­
sien fer free energy, 
G =H -TS (3-8) 
where 
G = Gibbs free energy, kcal 
T = abselute temperature, OK 
S = entropy, kcalloK . 
H = enthalpy, kcal 
The enthalpy is the tetal energy centent ef an element or cempeund. The 
free energy is that part ef the tetal energy that is available to. perferm 
"useful werk," that is, ether'than pressure-velume werk. The entropy is 
a sort ef internal manifestatien ef energy that can be visualized in several 
ways; fer example, entropy is eften defined as describing the degree ef 
erder er organization in ci system. Highly structured materials (e.g" well­
fermed crystals) have lew entropy while randemly arranged systems (e.g., 
a gas) have high entropy. The product TS is that part ef the tetal energy 
which is net available fer useful work. 
Fer clesed systems at censtant pressure and censtant temperature, the 
criterien fer equilibrium is that the tetal free energy ef the system (GT) is 
a minimum. Fer example, censider the reversible reactien previeusly 
examined in Eq. 3-1, 
aA + bB <2 cC + dD 
If we were to. add A and B to. a reactien vessel and calculate the tetal free 
energy ef the system as a functien ef extent ef reactien as the reactien 
proceeded, we weuld find semething like that depicted by the selid line 
at the left side ef the diagram in Fig. 3-2. The tetal free energy, G T, is the 
sum ef the free energies ef each ef the reactien cempenents. Fer example, 
if n A, n s, n e and no represent the number ef meles ef A, B, C and D 
that are present and G A, G s, G e, and G 0 represent the free energy/ 
mele ef each substance, then

the far right side. 
Conversely, if we were initially to add only C and D to the reaction vessel. 
calculation of the total free energy of the system as the reaction proceeded 
to form A and B would produce a curve of the form shown by the dashed 
line on the right-hand side of Fig. 3-2. In each case the reaction only 
proceeds spontaneously, or without any external help, as long as the 
value of GT decreases. Because of this there exists, at a certain extent of 
reaction, a point where GT is at a minimum. This point can be sponta­
neously reached from either the product or reactant side, and it is the 
equilibrium point of the system. Thus we may state that the equilibrium 
condition of a reaction is the point at which GT is a minimum. Also, we 
may deduce that reaction in the direction that decreases G T is spontaneous 
while reaction in the direction that increases GT is not spontaneous or 
will not occur in a closed system. 
It can be shown that as any reaction proceeds an incremental amount, 
the change in GT is proportional to tl.G where 
tl.G = (~ VIG) "od"" - ( ~ VIG) ",,',"" (3-9) 
where VI is the stoichiometric coefficient (e.g .. a, b, c, and d in Eq. 3-1) 
and G I is the free energy per mole. 
We can therefore state that if, 
1. tl.G is < 0 (Le .. tl.G is negative and thus GT decreases as the 
reaction proceeds); the reaction may proceed spontaneously as 
written. 
2. tl.G is > 0 (Le., tl.G is positive and thus G T would increase if the 
reaction were to proceed); the reaction cannot proceed sponta­
neously as written. Conversely, it may proceed spontaneously in 
the opposite direction to which it is written. The Thermodynamic Basis of Chemical Equilibrium 63 
3. AG = 0 (i.e., GT is at a minimum); the reaction is at equilibrium 
and will not proceed spontaneously in either direction. 
Values of t.G for a reaction provide us with a powerful tool to predict 
whether or not reactions are possible. To calculate t.G for the general 
reaction given by Eq. 3-1, we use the relationship 
where t.G = t.G' + RT I {C}, {D}d 
n {A}' {B}b 
t.G' = (~ v/G,o) ,,,du,t; - ( ~ v,G/1 """", (3-1O) 
(3-11) 
{ } = activity, or active concentration (discussed later in this section) 
G,' = free energy/mole of species i at 25'C and I atmosphere pressure 
Equation 3-10 is developed...!n more detail later. The first step in deter­
mining t.G is to determine G,', the free energy per mole of each reactant 
and product at the standard state condition of 25'C and I atm total 
pressure. The term G,' is called the standard free energy per mole of 
species i. 
At standard state every element is assigned, by convention, d free 
energy of zero per mole. Thus H2(g}, 02(9)' CgraPhlte{S)' and so forth, all are 
assigned free energy values of zero kcallmole. Also, to establish a 
baseline for ionic substances in solution, H+ at a concentration of I molel 
liter in an ideal solution and at standard state conditions has been 
assigned a free energy of zero. 
This convention is necessary because it is impossible to measure 
absolute values of free energy. However, we can measure changes in 
free energy. Thus, assigning a value of zero to elements at standard state 
allows us to measure the free energy change involved in forming 
compounds at standard state from their component elements at standard 
state. This free energy change is called the standard free energy of 
formation, t.G,'. Table 3·1 presents a summary of t.G,' values for some 
substances commonly encountered in water chemistry; for example, we 
can determine that the formation of calcite (CaCO",)} from carbon, 
calcium, and oxygen has the following free energy, 
C(graphite) + ~02(9) + CatS) --7 CaC0 3(S); 
calcite t.G,' = -269.78kcallmole 
The minus sign indicates that free energy is released or given off. We 
can also deduce that to break down I mole of calcite into I mole of Ca 
metal, I mole of graphite, and I t moles of oxygen would require the input 
of +269.78 kcal of free energy per mole. 64 TABLE 3-1 Thermodynamic Constants for Species of

Now.let us use this information to determine the free energy change 
associated with the reaction in which calcite dissolves in acid, H+, to 
form the calcium and bicarbonate ions. 
(3-12) 
Even though it does not occur physically, we can visualize this reaction 
as taking place by CaCO",) and H+ reacting to form their component 
elements; these elements then recombine to form Ca2+ and HC03-. Thus

~G' = -2.71 
This computation allows us to see two things. First, with respect to the 
dissolving of CaCO",) in acid, if we react 1 mole of H+ with 1 mole of 
calcite to produce 1 mole of Ca2+ and 1 mole of HC0 3 -at 2S'C, free energy 
is released because ~G' is negative. Second, and more generally, we 
can see it is possible to determine the overall standard free energy change 
for the reaction as written, ~G', from the free energies of formation of 
reactants and products by using Eq. 3-ll with ~Gt.1 being used in place 
of GI'. Thus 
(3·13) 
where VI is the stoichiometric coefficient of species i. Or for Eq. 3-12 
(3-14) 
Equation 3-13 has limited usefulness because it only refers to the 
situation when all reactants and products are at standard state. We are 
almost always interested in systems whose components are at other than 
standard state. We can relate the free energy of a single substance at a 
state other than standard to its free energy of formation at standard state 
by the expression 
G, = tlGt., + RT In {i} (3-lS) 
where 
G; = the free energy per mole of substance i in a state other than 
standard measured relative to our established datum 
{i} = the active concentration, or activity, of species i 66 Chemical Equilibrium 
The value of the activity of a substance is dependent on the choice of 
standard state conditions-the conditions that result in unit activity-just 
as the value of e.G," is dependent on the choice of standard state. 
Consistent with the choice of standard state conditions used to develop 
Table 3·1 and in most publications on aqueous chemistry, the following 
interpretation of activity is used throughout this book: 
I. For ions and molecules in solution, {i} is related to the molar 
concentration, [ij, by {i} = 'Y1[ij where 'Y, = activity coefficient. As 
the solution becomes dilute (most cases of interest to us), 'Y, 
approaches I and {i} approaches [i]. 
2. For the solvent in a solution, {i} = 'Y,X, whereX, is the mole fraction. 
As the solution becomes more dilute, 'YI approaches I. The activity 
generally is assumed to be I for the dilute solutions of concern to 
us. 
3. For pure solids or liquids in equilibrium with a solution, U} = I. 
4. For gases in equilibrium with a solution, {i} = 'Y,P I where P I is the 
partial pressure of the gas in atmospheres. As the total pressure 
decreases, 'YI approaches I. When reactions take place at atmos­
pheric pressure, the activity of a gas can be approximated closely 
by its partial pressure. 
S. For mixtures of liquids, {i} = X I where X I is the mole fraction. 
Returning to our example of the dissolution of CaCO"" in acid, Eq. 3-
12, and combining Eqs. 3-9 and 3-IS, we can write . 
e.G = e.G('HCO,-+ RT In {HCO,-} + e.G(,c," + RT In {Ca2+} 
-e.G1.H+ -RT In {H+} -e.G(,c,co"" -RT In {CaCO",,} 
Collecting terms, we obtain 
ilG = 6.G"HCOJ-+ 6.Gt.ca2-t--ilG£,H+ -ilGf,Caco3(5) 
+ RT In {HCO,-} + RT In {Ca2+} -RT In {W} -RT In {CaCO",,} 
Since, from Eq. 3-13, 
we can state - -llGo = AGf,HCOl-+ AGr.ca2-t--6.Gf.H+ -.6.Gf.caco3ts) 
e.G = e.Go + RT In {HCO,-}{Ca2+} 
{W}{CaCO",,} (3-16) 
This is a specific form of Eq. 3-10 applied to the acid dissolution of The Thermodynamic Basis of Chemical Equilibrium 67 
CaCO",) reaction. For dilute solutions, since the activity of pure solid is 
unity and assuming that the activity coefficients of the ionic component 
are equal to I, we obtain 
IlG = IlG' + RT In [HC0 3-][Ca2+] 
[H"] (3.17) 
In examining Eqs. 3·16 and 3·17, and the general form of the equation, 
Eq. 3·10, we can see that the logarithmic term has a form that is 
reminiscent of the equilibrium constant for the reaction as written in Eq. 
3·12. HoWever, because the magnitude of the logarithmic term is not 
equal to the equilibrium constant except at equilibrium, we call this term 
the reaction quotient, Q, where 
or in dilute solution Q = {HC0 3-HCa2+} 
{W} {CaCO",)} 
Q = [HC0 3-][Ca'+]

More generally, for the reaction 
or in dilute solution, aA + bB ~ cC + dD 
, {C}'{D}d 
Q = {A}a {B}b 
[CJ' [D]d 
Q = [A]a[B]b 
Combining Eqs. 3·10 and 3·19 (or Eqs. 3·16 and 3·18), we can state, (3·18) 
(3.19) 
IlG = IlG' + RT In Q (3·20) 
When the value of Q is identical to that of the equilibrium constant K, 
that is, the system is at equilibrium and IlG = 0, we can then write 
0= IlG' +RTlnK 
or 
IlG'= -RTInK 
Substituting Eq. 3·22 into Eq. 3.20, we obtain 
Q IlG = -RTlnK +RTlnQ =RTln K (3·21) 
(3·22) 
(3·23) 
Equation 3·23 allows us to develop another set of criteria to determine 
whether reactions are possible or not because the ratio of QIK will 
determine the sign of IlG for a reaction. 68 Chemical Equilibrium 
I. If QIK > I, then tl.G is positive and the reaction is impossible as 
written. 
2. If QIK = I, then tl.G = 0 and the system is at equilibrium. 
3. If QIK < I, then tl.G is negative and the reaction is spontaneous as 
written. 
The use of the tables of free energy values and the determination of 
whether a reaction is at equilibrium is illustrated in the following 
examples. 
Example 3-1

dissociates to H+ and OH-at 25°C.

Based on the selection of standaz:d state conditions given previously in this 
section and neglecting ionic strength effects, K can be written as follows 
for dilute solutions, 
K = [W][OH-] 
This equilibrium constant is usually given the special designation Kw' 
2. From Eq. 3·20, 
tl.G = tl.G' + RT In [W][OH-] 
tl.G = 19.09 + 2.3 x 1.98 x 10-3 x 298 xlog [(10-')(5 xlO-')] 
tl.G = +1.03 
Because AG > 0, the reaction is not spontaneous as written and can proceed 
spontaneously only in the opposite direction, that is, H+ and OH-are 
combining to form H20 molecules. The Thermodynamic Basis of Chemical Equilibrium 69

We now have sufficient information to provide answers to the question 
posed earlier in the chapter about sulfide stability in the presence of 
nitrate. 70 Chemical Equilibrium 
Example 3-3 
Is it possible at 25°C to oxidize sulfide in natural waters with nitrate? Typical 
concentrations that exist are 10-4 M of reacting species and pH 8 ([H+] = 10-8 M). 
Assume that ionic strength effects are negligible (these effects will be discussed 
later in this chapter). The reaction is

Because 6.G is negative, the reaction will proceed spontaneously as written at 
the reactant concentrations indicated. 
An important property of standard free energy changes, lJ.Go, is that 
they are additive. For example, if in Iwo reactions the product of one 
reaction serves as a reaclant in the other, the lJ.Go value for the combined 
reactions is the sum of the ll.Go values of the two reactions. In our previous 
example of the dissolution of CaCO, in acid, we wrote the equation 
CaCO",) + H+ '" CaH + HCO,-. In the slrict chemical sense this overall 
reaction is a composite of

with a: standard free energy change of tlG' = 11.38 -14.09 = -2.71 kca!. 
Whether the composite reaction is spontane'ous depends upon the value 
of tlG for that reaction. a function of tlG' and Q. If tlG for the composite 
reaction is negative (positive). it is not necessary that each of the 
individual reactions have a negative (positive) value of tlG. Note further 
that it is the value of tlG. not tlG', which controls the direction of a 
reaction. 
3.4. ENTHALPY AND THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE 
EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT 
The enthalpy change of a chemical reaction (tlH) is the amount of heat 
that is released or taken up during the course of the reaction. If tlH is 
negative. heat is evolved and the reaction is called exothermic; if tlH is 
positive, heat is taken up and the reaction is called endothermic. 
The term tlH' is of most interest to us. For a reversible reaction in a 
closed system it is relateq to tlG' by 
(3.24) 
Similarly to tlG'. tlH' for a reaction can be calculated from 
tlH' = ( t vHt) p"du", -( t v,H,') """'" (3·25) 
where 
Vi = the stoichiometric coefficient 
H,' = the enthalpy of species i in kcallmole at standard conditions of 
25'C and I atm pressure 
For the general reaction, aA + bE ;;=: cC + dD, tlH' is equal to the amount 
of heat taken up or released when a moles of A and b moles of E, each 
in their standard states. are completely converted to c moles of C and d 
moles of D. each in their standard states. 
Just as we could not determine the absolute value of G,', we also cannot 
measure H,'. As with G,' we circumvent this problem by assigning Ht a 
value of zero to all elements in their most stable form at 25'C and I atm 
pressure. In aqueous solution I molelliter of the hydrogen ion. H+. in 
ideal solution (y = J) also is assigned an 11' value of zero. We can 
determine values of enthalpy of specie~based on these assignments and 
call these the enthalpy of formation. tlH,'. Similarly to the computations 
for tlG,' values, we can compute the tlHf' values of various compounds 
from the assigned H' values of their component elements. A selection of 
these tlHt values is given in Table 3·1. 72 Chemical Equilibrium 
Standard enthalpy change values, ilHo, for reactions are most commonly 
used in water chemistry to determine the effect of temperature on the 
position of equilibrium, A useful expression in this regard is due to Van't 
Hoff, which states that 
dinK ilW --=--
dT RT' (3-26) 
If we assume that. over a limited temperature range, 6.Ho is not a function 
of temperature, integration of Eq_ 3-26 yields 
In K, = ilW (.!. _ .!.) 
K, R T, T, (3-27) 
or 
ilHo 
In K = -RT + constant (3-28) 
or 
( -t!.HO) K = C' exp liT" (3-29) 
where C' is a constant. Application of the Van't Hoff relationship is 
illustrated in the following example. 
Example 3-4 
A municipal water supply enters a residence at 15°C and is heated to SO°C in 
the home water heater. If the water is just saturated with respect to CaC03(S} at 
25°C. what will be the condition of the water (i.e., oversaturated or undersaturated) 
with respect to CaC0 3(S} (1) as it enters the residence and (2) as it leaves the water 
heater? 
Solution 
Let us tackle this problem using the equation 
as the basis for our solution. We are told that at 25°C the concentrations of Ca2+,

the value of the equilibrium constant using the tl.G,o value for this reaction of 
-2.71 kcal. which was calculated in Section 3·3, and then determine the value of 
the equilibrium constant at 15°C and at SO°C using llH,o values from Table 3·l. Enthalpy and the Temperature Dependence of the Equilibrium Constant 73

At 15°C the equilibrium constant is greater, and at 6Cf'C it is less. than that at 
25°C. Thus the term 
Q = [Ca2+][HC0 3-] 
[H+] 
is greater than K at SO°C and less than K at 15°C. The water had a value of Q that 
met equilibrium conditions at 25°C and the value of this quantity will not change 
as temperature decreases. Therefore, if we may assume that [H+1 remains 
constant, the water at 15°C contains less Ca2+ and HC03-than allowed by 
equilibrium, that is, it is undersaturated. By similar reasoning. at 60°C the water 
is oversaturated with respect to CaC0 3(S) and CaC03!s) will be deposited within 
the heater. Note that these conclusions have some bearing on the life of home 
water heaters. 74 Chemical Equilibrium 
We see from the example that the equilibrium constant for CaCO",) + 
H* ;;=: Ca'+ + HC03 -at 15°C is approximately 1.5 times larger than at 
25°C; at 60°C it is less than t as large as at 25°C. One could have sensed 
that K would decrease as the temperature increases from the value of 
t.Ho, which is negative. Since heat is produc~d as the reaction goes to the 
right, raising the temperature tends to drive the reaction to the left, thus 
decreasing the equilibrium constant. If we take heat away from the 
reaction by lowering the temperature, the equilibrium is shifted to the 
right and the equilibrium constant increases. This is an example of the 
general situation that for exothermic reactions, an increase in temperature 
will shift the equilibrium in the direction of less complete reaction; for 
endothermic reactions, an increase in temperature will shift the equilib· 
rium in the direction of more complete reaction. 
The t.HO values for a series of consecutive reactions can be added, just 
as were t.Go values, to yield an overall t.Ho value for the overall reaction.

. ~~------To calculate activity coefficients of ions in aqueous solution, we must 
employ the quantity ionic strength, fL, which was devised by Lewis and 
Randall' to describe the intensity of the electric field in a solution: 
~ .. 
fL = ~2: (CIZl) (3-32) 
where 
C I = concentration of ionic species. i 
Z I = charge of species i 
~~--------------....,.....-----------~ 
Application of this equation is shown in the following two examples. 
Example 3·6 
Compute the ionic strength of. a solution containing the following concentration 
of ions:

They both have virtually the same ionic strength. 
Rather than work through laborious calculations of ionic strength for 
more complex solutions than those given in the examples. it is usually 
precise enough for most purposes in water chemistry to use an approxi~ 
mation of ionic strength derived from a correlation with specific conduc­
ance or T~i§,,~~_siliQ§). The conductance of a solution is a 
measure of the ability of a solution to conduct a current. It is a property 
attributable to the ions in solution. Electrical current is transported through 
solutions via the movement of ions. and conductivity increases as ion 
concentration increases. Figure 3-3 is a presentation of data given by Lind' 
on the conductance versus ionic strength of various surface and groundwa­
ters. If the conductance of a water sample is known. this figure can be used 
to provide a crude estimate of ionic strength. 
Langelier presented the approximation.5

for several waters he examined. In this expression TDS is the total

Ionic strength appears in each of the various expressions used to 
calculate activity coefficients in aqueous solutions. The DeBye-Hiickel 
theory of interaction of ions in aqueous solution incorporates both the 
electrostatic interactions between ions and the thermal motion of the 
ions. The basic equation. called the DeBye-Hiickel limiting law. was

Equation 3·36 is also called the Giintelberg approximation of the 
DeBye-Huckel theory and is also commonly used to calculate y for ions 
of various charge at temperatures other than 15°C. It is also plotted in 
Fig. 3·4. There have been other extensions of the theory to make it apply 
at higher ionic strengths. There is, however, no satisfactory theory that 
provides a good estimate of the activity coefficient for ionic strengths of 
greater than about 0.5. 
Because anions cannot be added to a solution without an equivalent 
number of cations (and vice versa), it is impossible to determine experi. 
mentally the activity coefficient of a single ion. Therefore, Eqs. 3·34, 3.35, 
and 3·36 cannot be verified directly. However, it is possible to define, and 
measure experimentally, a mean activity coefficient, y±, as,

The theory for predicting the activity coefficients of nonelectrolytes in 
aqueous solution is not as well developed as for electrolytes. An empirical 
equation of the form 
log y = k,,.. (3·40) 
is generally used to relate activity to ionic strength. The salting-out 
coefficient k, must be experimentally determined. Because values of k, 
generally fall in the range from 0.01 to 0.15. nonionic or molecular solutes 
have activity coefficients of approximately I for ionic strengths of less 
than 0.1. 
For example, if k, = 0.132 for oxygen in NaGI solution' and,.. = 0.05, 
log Y = 0.132 x 0.05 = 0.0066 
then 
y == 1.02 
As the ionic strength increases, for example, in seawater ionic strength 
is approximately 0.7, Eq. 3-40 predicts that the activity coefficient of 
oxygen will be 
logy = 0.132 x 0.7 = 0.0924 
y = 1.24 
, M. Randall and C. F. Failey. Chern. Rev" 4: 285 (1927). Nonideal Behavior of Ions and Molecules in Solution 81 
The activity coefficient is greater than one. We can visualize that this 
is indeed possible if we think of the condition of the water in seawater. 
Because there is so much salt present, there will be a significant quantity 
of the H20 present as water of hydration associated with the ions present 
in the seawater. Oxygen dissolves less well in water which is bonded to 
ions so that a given total volume of water will dissolve a smaller 
concentration of oxygen at equilibrium if it contains much sail. If the 
oxygen dissolved in the seawater is in equilibrium with the atmosphere, 
-i the activity of oxygen in the water is controlled only by the partial 
-J\'" pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere. It is not a function of salt content 
of the water. Therefore, if the dissolved oxygen activity is constant while 
the dissolved oxygen concentration decreases as the salt concentration 
increases, we see from the equation, {i} = 'Y,[ij, that 'Y must be greater 
than 1. This phenomenon is illustrated by Example 3-9. The effect of 
decreasing the solubility of molecular species, such as dissolved oxygen, 
by increasing salt concentration is known as the "salting-out effecl." 
Example 3-9 
Given that the equilibrium constant, Henry's constant, KH, for the reaction 
O2(9) ~ 02(aQ) 
is 1.29 X 10-3 at 25°C and assum~ng a salting.out coefficient, ks' of 0.132, determine 
the molar dissolved oxygen activity and concentration at 25°C for (1) distilled 
water, (2) the Sacramento River water (specific conductivity = 450 p.mho), and for 
(3) Pacific Ocean water (ionic strength = 0.7). 
Solution 
Dissolved oxygen in distilled water: 
Since p. = 0, {02{aQ)} [02(aQJ. Knowing POz we can calculate [02(aQ)] from the 
equilibrium constant,

In dry air the volume fraction of oxygen is 0.21. At 25°C the vapor pressure of

The ionic strength estimate for Sacramento River water: 
From Fig. 3-3 for a specific conductance of 460 I'mho, I' = 0.007. 82 Chemical Equilibrium 
Let us assume that the partial pressure of oxygen is the same over the Pacific 
Ocean as it is over the Sacramento River (a reasonable assumption). Because of 
this the dissolved oxygen activity will be the same in both solutions. 
For Sacramento River water, 
p. = 0.007 and 
log y = 0.132 X 0.007 
y = 1.002 
For Pacific Ocean water, 
Now since p.=0.7 and 
logy =0.7 xO.132 
y = 1.24 
For Sacramento River water. k, = 0.132 
k, = 0.132

21aq) 1.24 
= 6.75 mg/liter 
For both waters the activity of oxygen is the same at 2.62 x 10-4 M or 8.4 mgllUer. 
It is significant to note that a dissolved oxygen test conducted on the two wat· 
ers using the wet chemical method (Winkler method) will produce a result of 
8.4 mglliter for the river water and 6.75 mglliter for the ocean water. The same 
analysis conducted using a membrane·covered, specific oxygen electrode will 
produce an identical reading in both solutions because it responds to activity 
rather than concentration. We might ask how a fish feels with respect to the 
dissolved oxygen content of these two waters. Does it care about dissolved oxygen 
activity or dissolved oxygen concentration? We leave the reader to ponder this 
question.

CHEMISTRY 
A thorough examination of acid-base chemistry is important in the 
study of aqueous chemistry. It is essential for understanding the carbonate 
system that has an important influence on the pH of natural waters and 
may govern the solubility of certain metal ions. Many precipitation­
dissolution. oxidation-reduction. and complexation reactions involve 
acid·base reactions. The concentrations of metal ions in water are 
governed to a great extent by acid-base phenomena. Thus the concentra­
tion of hydroxide ion may determine the concentration of many metal 
ions. Some metal ions behave as acids. for example. ferric ion has an 
acid strength comparable to phosphoric acid and much of its chemistry 
is governed by its acidic properties. In water treatment, the dosages of 
chemicals required to reduce hardness (calcium and magnesium) are 
partially governed by the acid-base properties of the solution being 
treated. 
In this chapter we will consider in detail acid-base reactions using 
relevant examples from water treatment processes and natural water 
chemistry to illustrate the various principles. Special attention will be 
given to techniques for calculating the composition of solutions of acids 
and bases. The chapters that follow and deal with precipitation, coordi­
nation chemistry, and oxidation-reduction chemistry will make use of 
many of the principles developed in this chapter. 
4.2. DEFINITION OF TERMS 
The most commonly used definitions of an acid and a base are those 
of Bransted and Lowry. These definitions state that an acid is a substance 
which can donate a hydrogen ion, H+, or a proton as it is commonly 
called, and that a base is a substance which can accept a proton. In the 
general reaction, . 
B-+ HA "" HB + A-
acidz base2 (4-1) 
a proton is transferred from HA to the anion B-. The substance HA is an 
acid because it can donate a proton; the substance B-is a base because Definition of Terms 87 
it can accept the proton. Note that the reaction is reversible so that a new 
acid, HB, and a new base, A-, are formed as the reaction proceeds to the 
right. In this reaction, HA, the proton donor, and A-, the base that forms 
when the proton is given up, are called an acid-conjugate base pair. 
Similarly, HB and B-are an acid.conjugate base pair. 
Water can be both an acid and a base. For example, in the following 
reaction, 
HCI + H20 ;;=': H,O+ + CI-
basel base2 (4-2) 
water is a base because it accepts a proton from HCI. In the reaction 
between the carbonate ion and water, 
CO,2-+ H20;;=': OR-+ HCO,-
basel acid 1 (4·3) 
the water molecule donates a proton to the carbonate ion and is therefore 
an acid. Substances that can function as both an acid and a base, such 
as HCO,-and H,O, are caJled ampholytes; they are amphoteric. 
In aqueous solution the proton is bonded quite strongly to a water 
molecule so that it is more correct to use the symbol H,O+, the hydrated 
proton or hydronium ion, rather than H+ to represent it in equations. 
Furthermore, there is good evidence that at least three additional water 
molecules are somewhat more loosely attached to the hydrated proton so 
that another representation of the proton in water would be H,O, + or 
H+·4H,O. The hydroxyl ion, OH-, also is hydrated, having three water 
molecules bonded to it, that is, H,O,-, or OH-·3H20. It is common to use 
H+ as a shorthand notation for H,O+ or H,O,+, and OH-to represent H,04-, 
although the formula H,O+ often is used to emphasize that acid-base 
reactions are proton exchange reactions. Because of its amphoteric 
properties water undergoes auto-ionization thus, 
H20 ;;=':H+ + OH-
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is 
{W}{OH-} 
K = {H20} (4-4) 
But because {H20} = I in dilute solution (see Section 3·3), by neglecting 
ionic strength effects we can write 
The auto-ionization reaction can be written also as 
H,O + H20;;=': H,O+ + OH­
with the resulting equilibrium constant, (4-5) 88 Acid-Base Chemistry 
K = {HaO+}{OW} 
{H,O}' 
or when {H,O} I and neglecting ionic strength effects, 
K = [HaO+][OW] = Kw 
We can derive the value of the equilibrium constant, Kw, for these 
reactions from free energy calculations. In doing this, we should recall 
that the free energy of the proton is zero. The free energy of the hydrated 
proton is the free energy of the proton, zero, plus the free energy of the 
water molecules bonded to it. Similarly, the free energy of the hydrated 
hydroxyl ion is the free energy of OH-plus the free energy of the water 
molecules hydrating it. In Example 3-1. a Ll.Go of + 19.09 kcal was 
calculated for Eq. 4-4, and making the same calculation for Eq. 4-5, using 
Ll.G,o values from Table 3-1 yields the identical value for Ll.Go. 
- - -
D. GO = ~ G~H30+ + .6. G"OH--~ Gf.H20 
Ll.Go = -56.69 + (-37.60) -2(-56.69) = +19.09kcal (4-6) 
Thus using the shorthand notation of H+ for HaO+ and omitting water 
molecules from both sides of Eqs. 4-5 does not affect the free energy 
change for the reaction. As shown in Example 3-1, K = I X 10-14 at 25°C 
when Ll.Go = + 19.09 kcal. 
In this text we will follow common practice and use H+ and OH-to 
represent the hydrated proton and hydroxyl ion, respectively. On occasion 
we will use HaO+ to emphasize that acid-base reactions are truly proton 
exchange reactions. 
The equilibrium constant, K" for an acid refers to the reaction in which 
an acid donates a proton to a water molecule (e.g., Eq. 4-2). The equilibrium 
constant, K., refers to the reaction in which a base accepts a proton from 
a water molecule (e.g., Eq. 4-3). Large values of K, indicate that the acid 
has a strong tendency to donate a proton to water, i.e., it is a strong acid. 
Large values of K. indicate that .a substance has a strong tendency to 
accept a proton from water, i.e., it is a strong base. Conversely, small 
values of K, and K. denote weak acids and bases, respectively. 
Table 4-1 is a listing of some K, and Kb values of relevance to water 
chemistry. The acids are listed in the order of decreasing strength while 
the bases are in the order of increasing strength. The dividing line 
between what the chemist refers to as a strong acid and a weak acid lies 
somewhere in the region of iodic acid (pK, = 0.8). Thus, of the acids 
listed, perchloric, hydrochloric, nitric, and HaO+ would be classified as 
strong acids while the remainder of the list are weak acids. Strong acids 
tend toward complete dissociation while weak acids are incompletely 
ionized. For acids with pK, values near the dividing line, dissociation is 
incomplete for high concentrations but tends toward completion for low Definition of Terms 89 
concentrations. This effect is known as the leveling effect of the solvent, 
water, and is dependent upon the relative affinities of the conjugate base 
and H20 for the proton. Similarly, the dividing line between strong and 
weak bases is in the neighborhood of dihydrogen silicate, (pKb = 1.4). 
Thus, of the bases listed, sulfide, hydroxide, amide, and oxide are strong 
bases whereas the remaining entries are weak bases. As illustrated in 
Table 4-1, the conjugate base of a strong acid is a weak base (small K.) 
and the conjugate base of a weak acid is a strong base (large Kb). 
An important relationship exists between the K, value of an acid and 
the K. value for its conjugate base. Using hydrocyanic acid, HCN, and 
the cyanide ion, CN-, as an example of an acid-conjugate base pair, we 
can write equations for the donation of a proton to water by HCN and for 
the acceptance of a proton from water by CN-.

where Kw is the equilibrium constant for ionization of water. Equation 4-
8 enables us to calculate Kb for the conjugate base of an acid if K, is 
known, or conversely, K, for an acid if Kb for the conjugate base is known. 
The Kw equation, which describes the dissociation of water, forms the 
basis for the definition of the pH scale. At 2S'C, Kw = 1.0 x 10-14 
{H+}{OH-}. Using the notation pX to signify -log X, we can write 
where pH + pOH = pKw = 14 
pH= -log{W} 
pOH = -log {OH-} 
pKw = -logKw 
When ionic strength effects are negligible, 
pH = -log [W] 
pOH = -log [OH-] gs

When {W} = {OW}, or [W] = [OW], pH = pOH and pH = pKw/2 = 7. In 
an aqueous solution where [H+] = [OH-], the solution is said to be neutral. 
At 25'C, neutrality is attained at pH = 7. Values of pH below 7 signify that 
[H+] > [OH-]: and the solution is said to be acidic. Conversely, pH values 
abov.e 7 indicate thsxt [OH-] > [H+] and the solution is said to be basic or 
alkaline. It is important to realize, however, that pH 7 only represents 
neutrality at 25'C because the pH scale has its origin in the Kw equation 
and Kw is a function of temperature. 
For example, fhe reaction H20 ;;= H+ + OH-has an enthalpy of reaction 
(from Table 3-1), 
1l.H' = 1l.1l1.H+ + tJ.Hf.OH--ll.Hf.H,o 
1l.H' = 0 + (-54.96) -(-68.32) 
1l.H' = + 13.36 kcal 
Using the Van't Hoff relationship, Eq. 3-27, we can calculate Kw at 50'C 
as follows, 
1l.H' (I I ) In Kw•50o = In Kw•25° -f! R 298 -323 
_ ( -'4) 13.36 (~ _1_) 
-In 1.0 X 10 + 1.987 X 10-3 298 -323 
KW•500 = 5.73 X 10-'4 
Thus, at 50'C, neutrality is at pH = -log (K W.500)'{2 = 6.62. Table 4-2 is a 
tabulation of K was a function of temperature and of the corresponding pH 
values of a neutral solution. 
As previously indicated, the equilibrium constant, K" of an acid gives 
an indication of its strength. It is, however, quite helpful to think of acid 
strength in terms of the standard free energy change of the reaction in 
which I mole of protons is transferred from the acid to water. For example, 
for nitric acid, using values given in Table 3-1. 
HN03 + H20:;=: H30+ + N03-
ll.G' = -26.43 -56.69 -(-26.41) -(-56.69) 
tJ.G' = -0.02 kcal 
Thus, under standard conditions, 0.02 kcal of free energy are released for 
each mole of proton-s transferred from nitric acid to water. Because this 
proton transfer enables the system to attain a lower free energy, the 
reaction tends to proceed readily in the direction written and accord­
ingly nitric acid is a very strong acid. From the relationship, ll.G' = 
-2.3RT log K Rate of Reaction 93

By comparison the free energy change for dissociation of the bisulfide 
ion, 
HS-+ H20 ;;= H,O+ + S'-
is + 19.1 kcal, a large positive number; accordingly, there is little tend· 
ency for this reaction to proceed as written and bisulfide is a weak acid 
(J(, = 1O-14.,}. 
4.3. RATE OF REACTION 
Acid·base reactions in aqueous solutions generally proceed extremely 
rapidly.' The reaction, 
k, 
W + OH-;;= H20 (4·9) 
k2 
with k, ~ 1.4 X 10" liter/mole, sec. and k, = 2.5 x IO-'/sec. at 25°C.' has 
the fastest reaction rate known in aqueous solution. Reaction rates of this 
magnitude are consistent with a diffusion·controlled reaction in which 
the ions diffuse to the point of contact and then react instantaneously. 
The H+ and OH-ions have exceptionally high mobilities. 
Since the reaction in Eq. (4·9) is elementary, we can write 
Forward rate = k, [If+}[OH-] 
Reverse rate = k2 [H20] (4·10) 
(4·11) 
1 For an exception see the discussion of the reaction H2CO; =<= H+ + HC03 -in 
Section 4·13. 
2 D. Benson, Mechanisms of Inorganic Reactions in Solution: An Introduction, 
McGraw·Hill, London, 1968. 94 Acid-Base Chemistry 
At equilibrium, forward rate = reverse rate; therefore, 
or [WJ[OH-] k, = k, [H,O] 
k,[H,O] 
k, [WJ[OW] (mole'lliter') (4-12) 
(4-13) 
Substituting for k, and k, and using 55_5 moles/liter as the concentration 
of water,3 we obtain the concentration product of water, 
(2.5 x 1O-5/sec)(55.5 molelliter) 
1.4 X 10+" liter/mole, sec. 0.99 X 10-'4 == 10-'4 
When ionic strength effects are negligible the concentration product 
equals Kw. 
The rate of reaction of H+ with bases other than OH-also is extremely 
rapid, although not quite as fast as its reaction rate with OH-, since other 
bases diffuse more slowly. 
The rate at which acids dissociate or give up a proton is a function of 
the affinity of the acid for the proton. Weak acids, with a high affinity for 
protons. dissociate relatively slowly. Similarly, weak bases have slower 
reaction rates than strong bases. Even though the reaction rates of weak 
acids and bases are slower, they can be considered essentially instan­
taneous as is shown by the following example for the weak acid H,s, 
pK, = 7.1. 
Example 4-1 
The dissociation of HaS is given by 
k, 
H,S "" H+ + HS­
k, 
where k, = 4.3 x UP sec-1•4 Assuming,that the reaction is irreversible, how long 
will it take for 50 percent of the HaS to dissociate? 
Solution 
The rate law 
d [H,S] = -k [H S] dt 1 2. 
3 It is necessary to use 55.5 moleslliter here because in the rate law, the 
concentration of water in moleslliter has been used whereas in the equilibrium 
constant. KWI we use the mole fraction for the concentration of water.

can be ,integrated between time = 0 and time = t to give 
I [H,S], k' n [H,S], ~ -,t 
where 
[H:;>.SJo = concentration at t = 0, and . 
[H:;>.SJI = concentration at t = t. 
Thus 
In, t ~ 1.6 X 10-4 sec -4.3 X 10+3 
From this value we would expect the dissociation of H:;>.S into HS-and H+ to be at 
equilibrium in a well~mixed solution only a fraction of a second after it is added. 
If H:;>.S were bubbled into a solution, the rate at which HS-would be produced 
would be controlled by the efficiency of the mixing device, even for the most 
efficient mixing system. 
4.4. EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS-A GENERAL APPROACH 
Because acid-base reactions in solution generally are so rapid, we can 
concern ourselves primarily with the determination of species concentra­
tions at equilibrium. Usually, we desire to know [H+j, [OH-j, and the 
concentration of the acid and its conjugate base that result when an acid 
or a base is added to water. As we shall see later in this text, acid·base 
equilibrium calculations are of central importance in the chemistry of 
natural waters and in water and wastewater treatment processes. The 
purpose of this section is to develop a general approach to the solution 
of acid-base equilibrium problems and to apply this approach to a variety 
of situations involving strong and weak acids and bases. 
Let us consider first the equations that describe a solution which results 
when an acid, HA, or a salt of its conjugate base, MA (where M is a 
cation) is added to water. 
4.4.1. Mass Balances 
In acid-base reactions the reacting species are conserved. When HA is 
added to water, the acid ionizes partially or completely, 
HA + H20:o= A-+ H30+ 
Let us assume that the system is homogeneous and closed (Le" no species 
containing A can enter from, or leave to, the atmosphere, and that 
precipitation or dissolution of such species cannot occur). A mass balance ~g)'~~~ ~ 
CT,A ~ [HAj + [A-j (4-14) 
.-<-~~-..----------
where CT•A is the number of moles of "species containing A" per liter and 
-~.-. 96 Acid-Base Chemistry 
is equal to the analytical concentration of HA or the number of moles of 
H!\ added per liter. [HA] and [A-] are the molar concentrations of the acid 
and conjugate base in solution at equilibrium. 
When C moles of the salt MA are added per liter, it dissociates 
MA"" M+ + A-
and the base, A-, reacts with water, 
A-+ H20"" HA + OH-
A mass balance on M gives,5

4,4.2. Equilibrium Relationships 
The second group of equations we need to consider describe equilibrium 
relationships. For the example of HA added to pure water the following 
equilibria are pertinent. In aqueous solution, neglecting ionic strength 
effects, we obtain for the dissociation of water, 
Kw = [W][OH-] = 10-14 at 25'C 
The dissociation of HA is described by 
[W][A-] 
Ka = [HA] (4-18) 
(4-19) 
The same equations are valid if the salt MA is added to solution. The 
basicity constant, 
K _ [HA][OW] 
b -[A ] (4-20) 
5 This mass balance assumes that M+ does not form complexes with A-or other 
solutes-on assumption that is legitimate for the alkali metals but may not be 
valid for alkali earth and transition metals (see Chapter 5). Equilibrium Calculations-A General Approach 97 
could .be used in place of Eq. 4-19. Since Kw = K,Kb, Eqs. 4-19 and 4-20 
cannot both be used because they are not independent. 
4.4.3. The Proton Condition 
The proton condition is a special type of mass balance equation on 
protons. It is an essential component of equilibrium problem solving if 
either H+ or OH-are involved in the equilibria. It is used in this section 
only to solve problems related to solutions made up in the laboratory. In 
later sections and chapters it is used to solve natural water problems. 
The proton mass balance is established with reference to a "zero level" 
or a "reference level" for protons (the proton reference level. PRL). The 
species having protons in excess of the PRL are equated with the species 
having less protons than the PRL. The PRL is established as the species 
with which the solution was prepared. 
Example 4-2 
Determine the proton condition when HA is added to water. 
Solution 
The species present are H30+, H20, OH-, HA, and A-. All species are involved 
in reactions with H+ or OH-. 
PRL = HA, H20, 
Species with protons> PRL·= H30+, 
Species with protons < PRL = OH-, A -. 
Proton Condition 
[H,O+] = [OH-] + [A-] 
Note that HA and H20, the species at the PRL do not appear in the proton 
condition. 
Example 4-3 
Determine the proton condition when the salt MA is added to water. 
Solution 
The species present are H30+, H20, OH-, M+, A-, and HA. The species that 
involve reactions with H+ or OH-are H30+, H20, OH-, A-, and HA. 
PRL = H20 and MA (or, equivalently, A-, since M+ completely dissociates from 
A-and does not affect the proton condition). 
Species with protons > PRL = HA, H,O+, 
Species with protons < PRL = OH-. 
Proton Condition 
[HA] + [H,O+] = [OW] 
Again the species at the PRL, A-, and H20, do not appear in the proton condition. 98 Acid·Base Chemistry 
Example 4·4 
State the proton condition for a solution of phosphoric acid, H3P04• in pure 
water. 
Solution 
The species present are H30+, H20, OH-, HaP04, H2P04-, HPO/-, and POl-. 
PRL ~ H,PO" H20, 
Species with protons> PRL = H30+ I 
Species with protons < PRL = OH-, H2P04 -, HPOl-, and P043-. 
Proton Condition 
[H,O+] ~ [OW] + [H2PO, -] + 2[HPOf-] + 3[PO,'-] 
Note that the concentration of [HPOl-} is counted twice because it has two less 
protons per molecule than the PRL. Similarly, [P043-] is counted three times, since 
P043-has three less protons per molecule than the PRL. 
Example 4·5 
State the proton condition for sodium bicarbonate, NaRCO s• added to water. 
Solution 
The species present are H+, H20, OH-, Na+, H2CO;, HCOa-, and CO/-.

Proton Condition 
A proton or hydroxyl mass balance also may be used to arrive at the 
proton condition.' This approach can be applied to the more complicated 
situation that arises when both MA and HA are added to the same 
solution, However, these more·complicated situations are more readily 
solved by obtaining the proton condition from a combination of the charge 
balance and the mass balance, as is shown in Section 4·4·4, 
4.4,4. The Charge Balance or Electroneutrality Equation 
The basis of the charge balance is that all solutions must be electrically 
neutral, Ions of one charge cannot be added to, formed in, or removed 
from a solution without the addition, formation, or removal, of an equal 
number of ions of the opposite charge, In a solution the total number of 
positive charges must equal the total number of negative charges, 
6 The details of this approach are given in J. N. Butler, Ionic Equilibrium, A 
Mathematical Approach, Addison.Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1964, Equilibrium Calculations-A General Approach 99 
Example 4-6 
Determine the charge balance when HA is added to water. 
Solution 
The species present are HA. A-, H20. OH-, and H+. 
Total positive charges = (H+J, 
Total negative charges = [OH-] + [A-]. 
Charge Balance 
Total positive charges = total negative charges 
or 
Example 4-7 
Determine the charge balance when MA is added to water. 
Solution 
The species present are M+, A-, HA, H+, OH-, and H20. 
Total positive charges = [M+] + [H+]. 
Total negative charges = [OW] + [A-]. 
Charge Balance 
[W] + [H+] = [OW] + [A-] 
Example 4-8 
Write a charge balance statement for Na2HP04 dissolved in water. 
Solution 
The species present are, Na+, H+, OH-, H20. HJP04, H2P04-, HPOl-, and P043-. 
Total positive charges = [Na+] + [H+]. 
Total negative charges = [OW] + [H,POn + 2[HPO.'-] + 3[POt-]. 
Charge Balance 
[Na+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [H,PO. -] + 2[HPO.'-] + 3[POt-] 
Note that the molar concentration of HPO/-is multiplied by two and the molar 
concentration of P043-is multiplied by three in the charge balance, since HPO/­
carries two negative charges per molecule while P043-carries three negative 
charges per molecule. 
Besides being essential to the solution of equilibrium problems. the 
charge balance equation has significant practical application in the 
analysis of waters. Since all waters must be electrically neutral. we can 
deduce that a complete water analysis must produce a result in which 100 Acid·Base Chemistry 
the total number of positive charges = the total number of negative 
charges. An acceptable water analysis will have this equation agreeing 
to within ±S percent for wastewater or seawater analyses and ± 2 percent 
for water analyses. Larger deviations than this indicate either errors in 
analysis or an overlooked species. 
Example 4-9 
An analysis of water from Well No.9 bf the Manhattan Bf?och, Californi.Q, Water 
Co. showed: pH = 7.8. silica = IJl mg 8iO,/liter. calcium = 65 mg CaH/liter (162.5 
mg as CaC03/liter). magnesium = 18.2 mg MgHliiter (75 mg as CaC03Iliter). 
sodium = 76 mg Na+lliter. bicarbonate = 286.7 mg HC03-lliter. sulfate = 28 mg 
S042-/liter, and chloride = 98 mg Cl-/liter.~.Is the water analysis satisfactory from 
the point of view of analytical accuracy? 
Solution 
Arrange anions and cations in separate columns as in Table 4·3. Compute 
millimoleslliter (mmoles/liter) of individual anions and cations by dividing the 
concentrations by the appropriate molecular weight. Then multiply by the 
charge/ion to obtain mmoles of charge units/liter, also called the milliequiv­
alentslliter (meq/liter) of charge units. Sum the meqlliter of positive and negative 
charges and compare sums for agreement. 
The analyses check with excellent accuracy. Note that SiOl does not enter into 
the computation. since it is not charged at pH = 7.8 (the pH of the water sample). 
and that Wand OR-are negligible. 
The charge balance and mass balance equations can be combined to 
give the proton condition. For complex solutions this is generally the best 
way to determine proton conditions. For example. when C moles of MA 
are added per liter of solution. assuming complete dissociation of MA. 
we obtain the following results.

Charge Balance 
(3) [W] + [H+] = [A-] + [OW] 
We can combine (I), (2), and (3) to eliminate M+, C, and CT,A to arrive at 
the proton condition, 
[HA] + [H+] = [OH-] 
Using the equilibrium equations in combination with mass and charge 
balances and the proton condition, it is now possible for us to proceed 
with the solution of acid·base problems and to arrive at the concentration 
of each species present in such systems. . 
Example 4-10 
State the equations necessary to arrive at the concentration of each species in 
I. 10-3 M solution of HA,

(4) [Wj = Wl + [OH-j 
If we make the assumption that activity coefficients of all species are unity, 
that is, ionic strength effects are negligible, then activities, { }, are equal to 
molar concentrations, [ J, and knowing Ka and Kw we can solve equations (1) to 
(4) simultaneously, or graphically, to yield the concentration of each species 
present. If we cannot assume that activities and molar concentrations are 
identical. then the activity coefficient must be calculated using the relationships 
given in Section 3-6. The equilibrium constants then can he converted from 
constants based on activities to constants based on concentrations, and the 
solution procedure is the same. 
b. The species present are Na+, A-, HA, OH-, and H+. We have five unknowns; 
therefore, five independent equations are required. 102 Acid·Base Chemistry

given in the sections that follow. 
4,5, STRONG ACID-STRONG BASE CALCULATIONS 
We can assume that when a strong acid is added to water, it is 
completely ionized. For example, when HCl 'J(, = 10') is added to pure 
water, a mass balance on Cl gives 
Since K, = 10' 
of unity, CT,CI = [HCl] + [Cl-] 
[WJ[Cl-l/[HCl] when activity coefficients have a value 
[Cl-] » [HCl] 
or [HCl] is approximately 0, and 
CT•CI = [Cl-] 
Although this assumption is valid for most strong acid or strong base 
calculations of interest. HCl is present in solution at all pH values. When 
the pH is very low « -2), the number of HCl molecules becomes a 
significant fraction of CT.CI and must be taken into account. However, it 
is extremely rare in water chemistry that we are concerned with pH 
values less than about I. The following three examples illustrate how the 
equations describing a strong acid or a strong base solution can be 
solved. Strong Acid-Strong Base Calculations 103 
Example 4-11 
10-' moles of HCI are added to I liter of distilled water at 25'C. Find [W]. [OH-]

9. Check the proton condition to find whether the concentrations that have 
been determined. that is. [W] = 10-'. [CI-] = 10-'. [OW] = 10-12• satisfy 
it to within 5 percent. 
[W] = [CI-] + [OW] 
10-' = 10-' + 10-12 104 Acid-Base Chemistry 
The proton condition is satisfied since the right.hand side and the left. 
hand side are virtually identical. 
10_ The pH of the solution is 
pH = 2 
II. To demonstrate that [HC1I is negligible compored to [CI-I and so justify 
our simplifying assumption in the mass balance: 
K = 10' = [W][Cn , [HC1I 
_ [10-'][10-'1 
10' -[HC1I 
[HC1I = 10-' 
[CI-I = 10-'» 10-' 
If the proton condition, or any equations for which assumptions were 
made, did not check within 5 percent, it would be necessary either to 
make a different simplifying assumption or to solve the equations without 
making an assumption. 
The criterion of agreement to within 5 percent is arbitrary. However, in 
view of the variation in reported equilibrium constants (reported values 
for a single reaction usually vary by more than 5 percent) and because 
of the purpose for which the calculations are generally made, accuracy 
better than 5 percent is rarely needed or justified .. 
Based on the result of Example 4-11, we will make the assumption, 
without verification, in subsequent calculations that strong acids and 
strong bases are dissociated completely. 
Example 4-12 
10-' moles of the strong acid HNO, are added to I liter of distilled water at 25°C. 
What is the pH of the solution? Assume that activity coefficients are unity.

Assumptions 
4. In proton condition: 
The solution is acid, so assume that

which is equivalent to assuming that [W] » [OW]. Thus

6. From (5) and 0)

7. Check the assumption in the proton condition:

10-7 ~ 10-7 + 10-7 
The assumption does not check since the right·hand side is 100 percent 
greater than the left-hand side. 
a. We now must try to make another assumption. The best approach is to 
assume the opposite situation from the assumption that did not work. 
Therefore, we will now assume that [OW] » [NO,-], having failed with 
our assumption that [NO,-] » [OW]. 
Using our new assumption in the proton condition, we find that 
9. From (I) and (8) 
K w ~ [WHOW] ~ [W]' ~ 10-14 
[W] ~ 10-7 and [OW] ~ 10-7 
10. Check this new assumption in the proton condition: 
[W] ~ [NOn + [OH-] 
10-7 ~ 10-7 + 10-7 
The new assumption does not check any better than the original one, so 
we must resign ourselves to solving the equations without making an 
assumption in the proton condition. The usual approach to this solution, 
and indeed to solutions where assumptions are not made, is to solve first 
for unknown concentrations in the proton condition (charge balance) in 
terms of [H+] and constants. We then can solve for [H+] and use its value 
to solve for other species concentrations. 
II. Substituting (I) and (2) in (3) to eliminate [OW] and [NO,-], we obtain 
10---14 
[W] ~ 10-7 + [W] 
or 106 Acid-Base Chemistry 
[W]' -Io-'[W] -10-" ~ 0 
which can be solved using the quadratic formula 
-b ±Vb' -4ac [W] ~ --7""--2a 
For this problem, a = L b = -10-7, and c = -10-14. Solving. we obtain 
[W] ~ 1.618 x 10-'; or pH ~ 6.79 
A similar set of assumptions and a similar calculation procedure can 
be used to calculate the species concentrations in the solution of a strong 
base as shown in the following example. 
Example 4-13 
Calculate pH and pOH in a 10-4 M NaOH solution at 25'C. Assume that activity 
coefficients are unity. 
Solution 
The unknowns are [W], [OW], and [Na+].

2. Mass balance on Na+ (assuming complete dissociation of NoOH),

3. [W] + [Na+] ~ [OH-] 
Assumptions 
4. In charge balance, the solution is basic, so assume 
[Na+]» [W] 
(This is equivalent to assuming [OW] » [WJ). Thus 
[Na+] ~ [OH-] 
5, From (2) and (4) 
[Na+] ~ [OH-] ~ 10-' 
pOH~4 
6. [W] ~ ~ ~ 10-" ~ 10-10 
[OW] 10-' 
pH ~ 10 
7. Check assumption in the charge balance 
10-10 + 10-' ~ 10-' Strong Acid-Strong Base Calculations 107 
The assumption checks, since the left·hand side of the equation is only a 
fraction of a percent larger than the right.hand side of the equation. 
In each of the preceding examples. ionic strength effects were neglected. 
Let us now recalculate the pH for Examples 4-11 and 4-13 taking ionic 
strength into account. In these examples. the mass balance and proton 
condition (charge balance) equations are unaffected because these are 
based on concentration rather than activity. However, we must make 
changes in all of the equilibrium expressions we use_ Since the K, 
equation is eliminated by a simplifying assumption. that is. strong acids 
and strong bases are completely dissociated. we are concerned only in 
these examples with the Kw equation_ This becomes 
10-14= {H+}{OH-} = YH+[H+]YOW[OH-] 
Using the Giintelberg approximation of the DeBye-Hiickel law (Eq. 3-36) 
to express activity coefficients as a function of ionic strength. 
0.5Z'JL"' -Iogy-=c:....c­. - I + JL 1/2 
We can calculate Y if JL is known. For Example 4-11. CT.CI

= 0.5(l'[H+] + (-I) '[CI-] + (-J)'[OH-]) (3-36)

(3-32) 
[OH-] (= 10-12) can be neglected because it is approximately 10 orders of 
magnitude less than [W] (= 10-') and [CI-] (= 10-'). 
JL = HI X 10-' + I x 10-') = 10-' M 
0.5(1) '(10-')'/2

YH+ = YOH-= 0.90 
The value. [H+] = 10-'. does not change because it was calculated using 
only the mass balance and proton conditions. which are based on 
concentrations rather than activities. 
pH = -log {W} = -log (YH+ [W]) = -log (0.9 X 10-') = 2.05 
and from Kw. 
[OH-] = 10-14 + = 10-14 
YH+YOH" [H] (0.9)(0.9)(10-') 1.2 X 10-12 M 
These values can be compared with pH = 2 and [OH-] = 1.0 x 10-12 when 
the effect of ionic strength was neglected. An eITor on the order of 10 
percent in [H+] and 20 percent in [OH-] resulted from neglecting ionic 108 Acid·Base Chemistry 
strength effects. We conclude that in solutions with an ionic strength of 
10-2 moleslliter and equilibria involving only monovalent ions, the effect 
of ionic strength can be significant. 
For Example 4.13, where [Na+] = 10-4 
fL = 0.5(I'[H+] + (-])'[OH-] + I' [Na+]) 
Using [H+] = 10-10, which was obtained by neglecting the effect of fL, we 
can see that [H+] is very small compared to [OH-] and [Na+], and can be 
neglected in the calculation of fL. Therefore, 
fL = 0.5(1 X 10-4 + I x 10-4) = 10-4 M 
(0.5)(1')(10- 4)11' 
-log I'H+ = -log I'ow = I + (10-4)'/2 = 4.9 X 10-3 
I'H+ = I'OH-= 0.99 
From Example 4·13 we found [OH-] = 10-4; this value does not change 
because only the mass balance and proton condition were used to 
calculate it. Therefore, 
{OH-} = I'OH-[OH-] = 0.99 x 10-4 
so that including the effect of ionic strength we obtain pOH = 4.004 
compared to pOH = 4.0 wherf ionic strength effects were neglected. Also, 
{H+} = 10-14 
= 10-14 
= l.01 X 10-10 
{OH-} 0.99 x 10-4 
and pH = 9.996 compared to pH = 10 when ionic strength effects were 
neglected. We therefore might conclude that at ionic strengths of 10-4 
molelliter, we can safely neglect the effects of ionic strength on equilibria 
involving only monovalent ions. 
4.6. WEAK ACID-WEAK BASE CALCULATIONS 
Weak acids and weak bases do'not ionize (or protolyze) completely in 
aqueous solution. The approach used to solve for the. concentrations of 
solution components for weak acid or base solutions is similar to that 
used for strong acids and strong bases. but we are not able to make the 
simplifying assumption in theK, or Kb equilibrium equations that complete 
dissociation takes place. Typical calculations for weak acid and weak 
base systems are illustrated in the following example. 
Example 4-14 
Calculate the concentration of all species in a solution prepared by adding 10-2 
mole of acetic acid, CR,COOR (HAc), to I liter of water at 25°C. Neglect ionic 
strength effects. Weak Acid-Weak Base Calculations 109 
Solution 
The unknowns are [W]. [OH-], [HAc], and [Ac-]. Thus four equations are 
required. 
Equilibria 
I. HAc "" W + Ac-; K. = 10-•. 7 = [W][Ac-l/[HAc] 
2. H,O "" W + OH-; Kw = 10-" = [WJ[OH-]

3. ~.Ao = [HAc] + [Ac-] = 10-' 
Charge Balance (or Prolan Condition) 
4. [W] = [Ac-] + [OH-] 
To solve equations (1) to (4). we can make the following assumptions: 
HAc is an acid so it dissociates to produce [H+] and (Ac-J. 
5. In the mass halance assume [Ac-] » [HAc]. Then 
. CT.Ao = [Ac-) = 10-' 
The solution is acid and therefore [OH-) is small. 
6. In the charge balance assume that [Ac-] » [OH-]. 
[W] = [Ac-] 
7. From (5) and (6), 
8. From (2) and (7), 
K 10-"

9. From (I) and (8), 
[W][Ac-] [10-'), 
[HAc] = K. = 10-•. 7 
[HAc] = 10+0•7 = 5 M 
10. Checking our assumptions. we find, in the proton condition. 
[W] = [Ac-] + [OH-] 
10-' = 10-' + 10-" 
This assumption is acceptable because the two sides of the equation are 
virtually equal. 
In the mass balance we find 
10-' = [Ac-] + [HAc] 
10-' = 10-' + 5 
This equation is hopelessly unbalcmced so that the assumption of [Ac-] » [HAc] 
is not acceptable. When we think about this assumption a little more, we can see 110 Acid-Base Chemistry 
that it was a poor one because we know that HAc is a weak acid so that only a 
small amount of Ac-will he present compared to the quantity of HAc. So let us 
now 'make the opposite assumption in the mass balance equation that 
[HAc] » [Ac-]. 
The mass balance becomes 
11. Cuo ~ 10-' ~ [HAc] 
12. Substituting (6) and (1) into (1) to eliminate [HAc] and [Ac] to solve fot 
[WI. we find that

IS. Checking our new assumptions. in the mass balance we obtain 
10-' ~ [HAc] + [Ac] 
10-' ~ 10-' + 4.47 X 10-4 
The error of this balance is [00-' + 4.47 X 10-4 -10-')110-'] x 100 ~ 4.5 
percent, which by our criterion of < 5 percent error is just acceptable. 
In the proton condition, we obtain 
[WI ~ [Ac-] + [OH-] 
4.47 x 10-4 ~ 4.47 X 10-4 + 2.24 x 10-" 
This assumption is acceptable because the right-hand side of the equation 
is virtually equal to the left·hand side. 
From this example we can see that even though one of our first 
assumptions was not valid, the <Ipproach of "making assumptions, 
obtaining a solution, and checking tlie assumptions" allowed us to correct 
the assumptions to obtain a solution with the desired degree of accuracy. 
If the second assumption in the mass balance had not yielded the desired 
accuracy, our approach would have been to obtain a solution without 
making any assumptions in the mass balance. This would have led to a 
quadratic equation in [H+], which could have been solved as in Example 
4-12.

(5), the mass balance on Na, (6), the mass balance On OCI, (7), the proton 
condition, and the two equilibrium relationships, 
K ~ 10-7.5 ~ {W}{OCn 
, {HOCI} 
_ 'YH+[W]Yoc,-[OCI-] 
-'YHOC' [HOCI] 
15. 'K, ~ 1O-7•5YHoc,!(YH'Yoc,-) ~ [H+][OCI-]![HOC1]. Then 
Kw~ 10-"= {W}{OH-} 
~ 'YH+[W]'YOH-[OH-] 
16. 'Kw~ IO-H/(yH'YoH") ~ [H+][OH-j. 
These equations are identical to the five equations used in part (a), except 
that cKa and cKw have replaced Ka and Kw. respectively. The approach to 
the solution of the equations is identical to that used in part (a). 
17. The ionic strength of the solution can be calculated to a good approximations 
using the ionic concentrations computed in part (a): 
fL = 0.52: C,Z? (3-32) 
I 
8 It is an approximation because ionic strength affects the degree of dissociation 
of HOCl. For a precise calculation, after the solution to part (b) is obtained, a 
new ionic strength should be calculated and a new solution should be obtained. 
In this problem the degree of dissociation is very close to that calculated in part 
(a), making the iterative calculation unnecessary. Weak Acid-Weak Base Calculations 113

19. It is assumed that the activity coefficient of HOCI is unity, since the ionic 
strength at which activity coefficients for neutral molecules deviate sig­
nificantly from unity is of the order of 0.1 M. 
20. Using the activity coefficients and equations (15) and (16) yields 
cKa = 10-7.46 
cKw = 10-13.96 
2L Solving equations (5), (6), (7), (15), and (16) as in part (a) yields the values 
shown in Table 4·4. It can be seen that there is very little change in [HOCI]. 
The chlorine solution in Example 4-15 has an ionic strength' of 10-3 
molesiliter, and again we see that the ionic strength correction had little 
effect and could have been neglected, Thus we can narrow down even 
further the range at which ionic strength effects become significant, since 
we notice significant effects at 10-2 moles/liter but not at 10-3 moles/liter. 
I! should be remembered that in each of these situations we have been 
dealing with equilibria involving only monovalent ions-for ions of higher 
charge the ionic strength value at which activity coefficient corrections

become significant falls to about 1O~3. The activity coefficient of a trivalent 
ion in a solution with an ionic strength of 1O~3 M is approximately the 
same for a monovalent ion in a solution with an ionic strength of 1O~1 M 
(see Fig. 3·4). 
Note that the free chlorine at pH 9.25 is almost entirely present in the 
form of OCI~. The distribution of the species HOCI and OCI~ and their 
variation with pH is a key factor in disinfection capability because the 
effectiveness of these two species as a bactericide is markedly different 
(HOCI being about 80 to 100 times more effective than OCI~ for some 
organisms). 
1.7. GRAPHICAL PROCEDURES FOR EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS­
pC-pH DIAGRAMS 
Graphical procedures are available that allow equilibrium calculations 
to be carried out much more readily than by the computations we have 
been discussing. However, it is important to master the computation 
method because the basis of the graphical procedure lies in the compu· 
tation method. Graphical procedures for acid-base systems consist of 
setting up equilibrium and mass balance equations Oll a double loga­
rithmic plot of -log concentration (pC) and pH. The diagram so produced 
is examined to determine the pH at which the proton condition (or charge 
balance) is satisfied. All of the species concentrations then can be read 
off from the graph at this pH value. To develop the graphical procedure. 
let us first consider the situation when a weak acid is added to water. 
The approach we use. and the diagram that results. are valid equally for 
addition 01 the conjugate base of the weak acid. or for a mixture of the 
acid and its conjugate base. For this example. HCN. 1O~3 moles. is added 
to I liter of distilled water at 25°C in a closed system with no atmosphere. 
We make the last stipulation because HCN"Q) is volatile and will tend to 
equilibrate with HCN,,) in the atmosphere above a solution. At this stage 
we wish to eliminate such equilibria from consideration. We will also 
neglect ionic strength effects. The equations that describe the system a;e

The first equation we plot on the diagram is the mass balance, which 
in logarithmic form is 
-log CT,eN = pCr,eN = 3 (4-25) 
Equation 4-25 is not a function of pH so it plots as a horizontal line at pC 
= 3 (see line 1, Fig, 4-1), 
The second equation plotted on the diagram is the K" expression, which 
in logarithmic form is

Fig. 4-1. The pC-pH diagram for cyanide-hydrocyanic acid; CT,CN = 10-3 M; 
pK, = 9.3 at 25'C. 116 Acid·Base Chemistry 
From this slope and intercept we can plot this line on Fig. 4-1 as line 
2. 
Now, by definition, 
so -log [W] = pH 
d (-log [WJ) 
dpH 
and when pH = 0, -log [H+] = O. From the slope and intercept we can 
plot this line on Fig. 4-1 as line 3. 
The H+ and OH-concentration lines are common to the graphical 
solution of all acid-base problems (and many other types of equilibrium 
problems) so that it would be handy to prepare pC-pH diagrams with 
these lines already plotted on them. The first step would then be to plot 
pCT on the diagram. 
The next lines to be plotted are for [CN-] and [HCN]. To plot these 
quantities in the pC-pH diagram, first we must derive expressions relating 
each of them to pH and constants. Tackling [CN-] first, we can combine 
Eqs. 4-21 and 4·23 to eliminate [HCN] and produce 
K, [W][CN-] (4-27) 
Rearranging, we obtain 
_ KaCT,CN 
[CN ] = ([W] + K,) (4-28) 
Now let us examine the region oUhe graph where K, » [H+] , or pH > 
pK,. Since pK, = 9.3 this region is at pH values above 9.3. 
Equation 4·28 becomes 
and 
(4-29) 
This is the equation o(a straight horizolltal line at pC = 3. It should be 
drawn on the diagram in the region of pH > 9.3 (line 4). Now let us 
examine the region of the graph where [H+] » K" or pK, > pH. Equation 
4-28 becomes 
which in logarithmic form is K,CT,CN = [CN-]

or 
The slope is 
When pH = pK, = 9_3 d(p[CN-]) 
dpH -I 
p[CN-] = pCT.eN = 3 (4-30) 
With this slope and coordinate we can plot the [CN-] line in the region 
pH < 9.3 (line 5). 
Since approximations were made to derive both sections of the p[CN-] 
line, we may not draw either section of the line through pH 9.3, the so­
called "system poin!." In the region around pH 9.3 we must draw a dashed 
line. We will return to the exact behavior of the lines in this region after 
development of the [HCN] line. 
We can solve Eqs. 4-21 and 4-23 to eliminate [CN-] with the result that 
and rearranging, K = [WHCT.eN -[HCN]) 
, [HCN] 
[HCN] = CT.eN[W] 
[W] +K, (4-31) 
In the pH region where [H+] » K" pK, > pH, this equation becomes 
[HCN] = CT.eN 
p[HCN] = pCr.eN = 3 (4-32) 
We can draw a horizontal straight line at pC = 3 for HCN in the pH region 
below pK, (line 6). 
In the region where [H+] « K" pH > pK" Eq. 4-31 becomes, 
When pH = pK, = 9.3 [HCN] = CT.eN[W] 
K, 
p[HCN] = pH + pCT.eN -pK, 
I -d(p[HCN]) + 1 s ope- dpH 
p[HCN] = pCT.eN = 3 (4-33) 
With this slope and coordinate we can plot the p[HCN] line in the region 
pH > 9.3 (line 7). Again we must forego drawing in the p[HCN] lines in 
the immediate vicinity of pK,. 118 Acid-Base Chemistry 
We now have lines for [HCN] and [CN-] plotted as a function of pH for 
the entire pH range, except in the immediate vicinity of pH = pK, because 
of the assumptions that were made_ To complete the graph in Fig_ 4-1, let 
us examine the position of these two graphs at the point pH = pK,_ From 
Eq. 4-27, when pH = pK" or when [H+] = K" we obtain 
or [CN-] = CT•eN 
2 
p[CN-] = pCT.eN + 0.3 
Similarly, when considering Eq. 4-31 at pH = pK, we find 
[HCN] = CT. eN 
2 
or in logarithmic form 
p[HCN] = pCT.eN + 0.3 (4-34) 
(4-35) 
From Eqs. 4-34 and 4-35 we can see that at the point (pC = (pCT.eN + 
0.3), pH = pK,) and [HCN] = [CN-]. Therefore we have a common point 
through which both the [HCN] and the [CW] lines must pass, which is 
located 0.3 log units vertically below P~.eN at pH = pK, = 9.3. This point 
can be entered on the diagram. The [HCN] and the [CN-] lines both pass 
through this point. They can be drawn through this point as a smooth 
curve that starts at about one pH unit either above or below pK = pK ,. 
If more accuracy is desired in this region, additional points can be 
calculated by substituting pH values in Eqs. 4-27 and 4-31. For example, 
at pH = pK, -1. 
p[HCN] = pC,.eN + 0.04 
and at pH = pK, + 1, 
p[CN-] = pCT,CN + 0.04 
The diagram in Fig. 4-1 now is complete. To use the diagram for 
determining equilibrium concentrations of various species, we must 
examine it (as illustrated in the following examples) to find the pH where 
the proton condition or charge balance is satisfied. It is only at points 
where proton conditions are satisfied that the diagram can be used to 
obtain equilibrium concentrations. 
Example 4-16 
What is the pH, pOH, [CN-j. and [HCNj in a 10-3 M HCN solution at 25°C which 
is closed to the atmosphere so that no HeN can volatilize? Neglect ionic strength 
effects. Graphical Procedures for Equilibrium Calculations-pC-pH Diagrams 119 
Solution 
The proton condition for HCN in H20 is 
We must use the same technique 9f approximation that was employed in the 
computation procedure to find the point in the diagram where the proton condition 
is satisfied. We are not. however, flying blind in this instance because we have 
the diagram to guide us in our selection of assumptions. Examining point A in 
Fig. 4·1, we can see that [CN-] » [OH-] and [H+] = [CN-]. This point satisfies 
our simplified proton condition, which when neglecting [OH-J becomes [H+] = 
[CN-]. Point A occurs at pH = 6.2 and we can read off all the other species 
concentrations at pH 6.2: [HCN] = J(J3, [H+] = 10-•. 2, [CN-] = 10-"', and [OW] = 
10-,·8. Our assumption that [CW] » [OW] is justified, since 10-'" » 10-,·8. 
The same diagram (Fig. 4·1) can be used to determine the pH of 10-3 M 
solutions of sodium cyanide, NaCN, and of mixtures of HCN and NaCN. 
Example 4·17 
Find the pH, pOH, [HCN], [CN-], and [Na+] in a 10-3 M NaCN solution. The 
temperature is 25°C; neglect ionic strength effects. 
Solution 
The proton condition for NaCN in H20 is 
[HCN] + [W] = [OH-] 
Examining Fig. 4·1 at point E, we see that [HCN] » [WI and the approximate 
proton condition [HCN] = [OH-], is satisfied. This point occurs at pH = 10.1. At 
ili~_~=IO~~~~=I~M~=I~~~1=IO~~ 
From a mass balance on sodium, [Na+] = Gr,Na = 10-3 M. 
Checki'ng our assumption in the proton condition, we find that 
10-10.1 + 10-3.9 = 10-3.9 
The assumption is acceptable, since the error is a small fraction of I percent. 
Example 4·18 
Find the pH, [HOCI], and [OCI-] in a solution to which 10-4 mole of sodium 
hypochlorite, NaOCI, and 5 x 1O-'.nlOle of hypochlorous acid, HOCI, pK. = 7.5, 
have been added per liter of solution. The temperature is 25°C; neglect ionic 
strength effects. 
Solution

previously. In the diagram, Fig. 4·2,

2. Because we added both an acid and a conjugate base we must account for 
the cation (Na+) accompanying the conjugate base in our diagram. 
A mass balance on Na+ yields 
CT•N, = [Na+] = 10-4 M 
peT,Na = 4 
We can draw the [Na+] line in the diagram as a horizontal line at peT = 4. 
To solve for the species present, we must examine the diagram for the 
point at which electroneutrality is met. For situations where an acid and 
its conjugate base are added. the charge balance is preferred over the 
proton condition for finding the point of neutrality because it is easier to 
write. 
The charge balance for our mixture is 
[Na+[ + [H+] = [OH-] + [OCI-] 
Examining Fig. 4-2, we can see that at point A, [Na+] » [H+] and [OCI-] » [OH-] 
so that the charge balance simplifies to [Na+] = [OCI-], a condition that is met 
at pH 7.7, At this pH. [Na+] = Hi'M, [OCI-] = Hi4 M, [H+] = 10--'" = 1.99 X Hi' 
M, [OH-] = 10--5.3 = 5.0 x 10--' M, and [HOCI] = 10--4.2 = 6.3 X 10:-' M. Graphical Procedures for Equilibrium Calculations-pC-pH Diagrams 121 
Checking the charge balance. we obtain. 
I X 10-' + 1.99 X 10-8 = I X 10-' + 5.0 X 10-7 
(I X 10-'+5.0 X 10-7) -(I x 10-'+1.99 xlO-81 
error = I X 10 .' + 1.99 X 10 8 X 100 
= O.S percent 
so that the assumptions are acceptable. 
We can prove that these are the only viable set of assumptions to make in the 
charge balance by using the pC -pH diagram to check the validity of other possible 
assumptions. For example. if we assume [H+] » [Na+] and [OCI-] » [OH-]. 
then the charge balance becomes [H+1 = [OCI-1. a condition that is met at point 
B in Fig. 4-2. However. at this pH of 5.8. [H+] = 10-5.8 and Na+ = 10-' so that [Na+] 
» [H+1 and our assumption is not valid. If we make the assumptions that [Na+] 
» [H+] and [OH-] » [OCI-]. then the charge ba.!nnce reduces to [Na+] = [OH-]. 
a condition that is satisfied at point C in Fig. 4-2. At this pH of 10. [OH-] = 10-' 
and'IOCI-] = 10-,·8 so that the assumption of [OH-] » [OCI-] is not acceptable. 
We have now made all possible combinations of assumptions in the charge 
balance and could by this process of elimination eventually find the correct set 
of assumptions. 
There are instances when assumptions in the proton condition are not 
possible. One of the more common situations encountered is when the 
analytical concentration of an acid is close to its K, value or the Kb value 
of its conjugate base. or the analytical concentration of a base is close 
to its Kb value or the K, value of its conjugate acid. It also becomes 
difficult to make simplifying assumptions in the proton condition for both 
acids and bases when their analytical concentration approaches 10-7 M. 
The approach to this type of problem is illustrated in the following 
example. 
Example 4-19 
Determin~ all species concentrations present in a 10-4•5 M NH4CI solution 
Solution 
Note that pCT•NH, = 4.5. which is close to pKb= pKw -pK, = 14 -9.3 = 4.7. We 
can expect trouble here. Construction of the pC-pH diagram follows previously 
described procedures (see Fig. 4-3). The proton condition is 
[W] = [NH~,,)] + [OW] 
Examination of Fig. 4-3 reveals that in the region where the proton condition 
is satisfied (an approximate pH of 6.7 to 7). it is not pOSsible to neglect [OW] or 
[NH3(aq)1 with respect to each other. We have several alternatives: (l) use a 
computational procedure. (2) guess the point in the diagram (e.g., just to the left· 
hand side of [W] = [NH~,q)]) where [W] = [NH",q)] + [OH-]. (3) read off values of 122 Acid·Base Chemistry

and then construct a pH versus P([NH.",] + [OW]) line so that the proton condition 
can be solved exactly in the diagram. With experience, alternative 2 is acceptable 
and speedy. Alternative 3 is illustrated in Table 4·5 and by the dashed line in Fig. 
4-3. Using this alternative, we find that pH = p([NH.",] + [OH-]) at pH = 6.8 and 
[NH.",] = 10-6•65, [NH,+] = 10-'·', [H+] = 10-6.', and [OH-] = 10-7.'. 
Example 4·26 later in this chapter deals with another situation in which 
approximations in the charge balance are not possible. 
4.8. DETERMINATION OF TEMPERATURE AND IONIC STRENGTH 
EFFECTS ON EQUILIBRIA USING pC-pH DIAGRAMS 
The pC ·pH diagrams can be used for systems having temperatures 
other than 25'C and ionic strengths other than zero. The modification of 
a 25'C·based pC-pH diagram for temperatures other than 25'C merely 
entails the use of equilibrium constants for the appropriate temperature 
in the equilibrium expressions used to construct the diagram. The Van't 
Hoff relationship (Eq. 3-27) can be used to convert 25'C equilibrium 
constants to the values at the desired temparature. 
Construction of pC-pH diagrams for ionic strengths other than zero 
requires the use of activities rather than concentrations in all equilibrium Effect of Temperature and Ionic Strength on Equilibria From pC -ph Diagrams 123

expressions. Mass balance and charge balance (or proton condition) 
equations are based on concentration and therefore are not corrected for 
activity. 
As an example of these two types of corrections, let us construct the 
pC -pH diagram for a 10-3 M hypochlorous acid solution at 15°C with an 
ionic strength of 0.1 M. In this example, equilibrium constants and pH 
values based on concentration measurements will be denoted as 'K and 
p'H while the constants and pH values based on activity will be referred 
to as K and pH. The constant K, for HOCI at 15'C is 10-7.,; Kw at 15'C is 
4.5 X 10-15 (see Table 4-2). The master variable in the pC-pH diagram is 
p'H, defined as 
p'H = -log [W] 
This is plotted as line I in Fig. 4-4. 
The line for [OH-] is derived as follows: 
Kw = {H+}{OH-} = 'YH+[W] 'YOH-[OW] 
'K w = [W][OW] = Kw 
'YH+ 'Yow 
-log [OH-] = p'Kw -p'H = -logKw + log 'YH+ + log 'YaH' -p'H (4-36) 
At p. = 0.1 we find from Fig. 3-4, that 'YHC = 0.83 and 'YOH-= 0.75; we then 
can compute that 'Kw = 7.2 X 10-15 and 
-log [OH-] = 14.14 -p'H (4-37) 
This equation plots as line 2 in Fig. 4-4. 
The mass balance equations are defined in terms of concentrations and 
do not need correction for p. or temperature. Thus CT•OCI = 10-3 = [HOCI] 
+ [OCI-] and 
pCr.CCI = 3

The system point is (pCH = p'K,. pC = -log CT•OC,)' instead of (pH = pK,. 
pC = -log CT•OC,) in the absence of corrections for ionic strength. 
The remaining equation necessary to describe the system is either the 
proton condition or the charge balance. Since these equations are based 
on concentration rather than act~vity, no correction for ionic strength is 
necessary. The pC-pH diagram in Fig. 4-4 can now be used to obtain 
concentrations as previously demonstrated. 
4.9. MULTIPROTIC ACID-CONJUGATE BASE EQUILIBRIUM 
CALCULATIONS 
A multiprotic acid can donate more than one proton. Consider. for 
example. sulfuric acid. H,S04' which can donate two protons. 
H,S04 :0= HS04 -+ H+; 
bisulfate 
ion 
HS04-:o= SO/-+ H+; 
. sulfate 
ion K,.1 == 10'. 
K = 10-' ,., 
H,S04 is classified as a strong acid while HS04 -is a weak acid. 
For the general case of a multiprotic acid added to water. we can 
construct a pC-pH diagram in a similar fashion to that used for a 
monoprotic acid. The procedure is somewhat more complex because we 
have additional species to consider as well as additional equilibrium 
statements. 
To illustrate the procedure. we will determine the pH and concentrations 
of all species present ([H,AJ, [HA-j. [A'-j. [WJ, [OH-]) when 10-' moles of 
the weak acid H,A (pK,.1 = 4 and pK,., = 8) are added to I liter of water 
at 25°C. We will neglect ionic strength effects. The equilibria are 
H,O :0= H+ + OH-; K w = [W][OH-j = 10-14 
[W][HA-j K -'--;::;;--;~ ,.1 -[H,Aj 
The mass balance on species containing A is 10-4

and is plotted in Fig. 4-5 as a horizontal straight line at pCT,A = 2. (4-42) 
(4-43) 
(4-44) 
(4-45) 
We will next develop lines for each of the A-containing species: [H,Aj. 
[HA-J, and [A'-j. First for H,A. by combining the mass balance. Eq. 4-45. 
and the two equilibrium relationships. Eqs. 4-43 and 4-44. we obtain [H,Aj 
as a function of [H+j. CT.A. and equilibrium constants. 126 Acid-Base Chemistry 
or 
[H,A] = CT,A (I + (K",![W]) ~ (K",K,,,t[Wl')) (4-46) 
We must now examine the behavior of Eq. 4-46 at various pH values so 
that we can plot an [H,A] line in the pC-pH diagram, In the region where 
[H+] »K,.1 »K"" or pH < pK',l < pK",. 
so that Eq, 4·46 becomes

In the region K", > [H+] > K',2' or pK", < pH < pK,,2' Eq, 4-46 becomes

[H2A] = CT,A K 
'" 
log [H,A] = log CT,A + log [H+] -log K", 
or 
p[H,A] = pCT,A + pH -pK", (4-48) 
Since d(p[H,A])ld pH = + 1, this is the equation of a straight line with a 
slope of + I that passes through the point (pH = pK"" p[H,A] = pCT,,), the 
first system point, This line is plolted as line 2 in Fig, 4-5 between pH 4 
(= pK",) and pH 8 (= pK,,,), In the vicinity of pH = pK", and pH = pK", 
dashed lines are plolted; we must make adjustments here, since our 
assumptions break down in these regions, 
In the region K", »K", » [H+] or pK", < pK", < pH, Eq, 4-46 becomes 
[HA]=C (I/K",K",)) , T,A [H+]' 
or in logarithmic form 
log [H,A] = log CT,A + 2 log [H+] -log K", -log K", 
or 
p[H,A] = pCT,A + 2pH -pK", -pK", (4-49) 
Since d(p[H,A])/d pH = +2, this is the equation of a straight line with a 
slope of +2 that passes through the point (pH = pK"" p[H,A] = pCT,A + 
pK", -pK",), This line is plolted in Fig, 4-5 as line 3 in the region pH > 
pK",. Dashed lines are again plolted in the region where pH approaches 
pK",. 
To complete the curve for p[H,A] versus pH, we must determine its 
behavior in the pH regions near pK", and pK", , From Eq, 4-43 we can 
show that when pH = pK"" [H+] = K", and [HA-] = [H,A] , Since, at pH 
values in the region of pK", , [A'-] is negligible, we can write 
or in logarithmic form, [H,A] = CT,A

p[H,A] = pCT,A + 0.3 (4-50) 
Thus at pH = pK"" p[H,A] plots at a point 0.3 units below the intersection 
of lines I and 2, 128 Acid-Base Chemistry 
When [H+] = K", = 10-8, we can determine the p[H,A] value by solving 
Eq, 4 -46 exact! y 
[H,A] = CT'A( 1 + (10 '/10 8)1+(10 12/10 1~) 
= CT'A( 2 /IO+~ = CT.A(5 x 10-') 
log [H,A] = log CT,A + log (5 x 10-') 
p[H,A] = 6,3 
Thus at pH 8 = pK"" p[H,A] plots at a point 0.3 units below the intersection 
of lines 2 and 3 in Fig. 4-5, 
The position of the [HA-] and [A'-] lines can be determined in a similar 
fashion by making approximations in the following equations developed 
by substituting the equilibrium expressions in the mass balance and 
solving for [HA-] and [A'-J, respectively, in terms of CT.A, [H+] and 
constants.

It would be a useful exercise for the student to construct lines for pH 
versus p[HA-] and p[A'-] using these equations and appropriate as­
sumptions. These lines plot as shown in Fig. 4-5. This pC-pH diagram 
differs in two major ways from that for a monoprotic acid: 
1. The diprotic acid diagram has two system points, (pK',l' pCT,A) and 
(pK ,,', pC T,A)' 
2, The lines for [H,A] and [A -] have regions where the slopes 
(d pCld pH) are +2 and -2, respectively. 
The use of the diagram is illustrated in the following example. 
Example 4-20 
Find the pH of the 25°C solution resulting from the addition of (J) 10-' moles of 
H,A to 1 liter of distilled water and (2) 10-' moles of Na,A to 1 liter of distilled 
water. Here pKa,1 = 4 and pKa.2 = 8. 
Solution 
1. To find the desired pH, we can use Fig. 4-5 in conjunction with the proton 
condition for H2A.

Examining the diagram, we see that at pH 3.05. the approximate proton condition 
[W] ~ [HA-] is satisfied_ At this pH, 2[A'-] and [OH-] are negligible compared to 
[HA-]_ Therefore, the proton condition is satisfied only at pH 3.05. At this pH, [H,A] 
~ 10-,·05, [HA-] ~ 10-3.05, [A'-] ~ 10-', and [OH-] ~ 10-10.95• Checking the 
assumptions in the proton condition,' . 
1O~3.o5 = 10-3.05 + 10-8 + 10-10.95 
The equation is valid to within a fraction of 1 percent. 
2. We can use Fig. 4-5 together with the proton condition for Na2A to find the 
pH. It is written as, 
(4-54) 
Examining the diagram, we see that at pH 10, [HA-] ~ [OH-] , and that 2[H,A] and 
[H+] are negligible in comparison to [HA-]. Therefore. the proton condition is 
satisfied only at pH 10. At this pH, [OH] ~ 10-'. [W] ~ 10-10, [H,A] ~ 10-10, 
[HA-] ~ 10-', and [A'-] ~ 10-'. Checking the proton condition, we see that there 
is much less than 5 percent eITor and therefore our assumptions are acceptable. 
Example 4-21 
The dibasic acid succinic acid is an important metabolic intermediate formed 
in plant and animal cells. The structure of succinic acid (pKa,l = 4.2 and pKa,2 = 
5.5 at 25'C) is 
GH, -GOOH 
dH, -GOOH 
which we will represent as H2Su. Find the concentrations of all species in a 10-2 
molar solution of succinic acid (H2Su). 
Solution 
Figure 4-6 is a pC-pH diagram for H,Su showing variations of [H+], [OH-] , 
[H,Su], [HSu-], and [Su'-] with pH. Note that because of the close proximity of the 
pKa values the lines for [H2Su] and [Su2-] have no straight line portions between 
pKa,l and pKa,2' The approach to obt?ining the position of these lines in the 
diagram is similar to that shown previously for the acid H2A, except that the same 
simplifying assumptions cannot be made in the general equation obtained by 
combining the mass balance and equilibrium equations for pKa,l < pH < pKa,2 
(e,g .. see Eq. 4-46 for the general acid H,A). The approach to obtaining a solution 
for concentrations of H2Su, HSu-. and Su2-in this region is to substitute values 
of H+ into the general equation for each of these species and to solve for the 
concentration at each pH. 
For H2Su the proton condition is 
[W] ~ [HSu-] + 2[Su'-] + [OH-] 
Examining the diagram, we can see that at pH 3.2, [H+] ~ [HSu-], and that 2[Su2+] 
and [OH-] are negligible compared to [HSu-]. Thus the protol). condition is 
satisfied only at pH 3.2. At this pH, [W] ~ 10-3." [OH-] ~ 10-10." [H,Su] ~ 10-', 130 Acid-Base Chemistry

[HSu-] = 10-3.2, and [Su2-] = 10-5.3• Checking our assumptions in the proton 
condition, we obtain 
10-3.2 = 10-3.2 + 2 X 10-5.3 + 10-10.8 
The assumptions are acceptable. 
The pC -pH diagram for a triprotic acid can be developed by extending 
the procedure used to plot the diagrams for monoprotic and diprot.ic acids 
to multiprotic acids. The advantage of the graphical procedure over 
computational method becomes gre'ater and greater as the number of 
equilibria increases. As an example, the pC-pH diagram for phosphoric 
acid, H,PO" is shown in Fig. 4-7 for Cuo, ~ 10-', (pK,.1 ~ 2.1, pK,., ~ 7.2 
and pK,., ~ 12.3 at 25'C). Applicable equations are, neglecting ionic

These equations can be examined for their behavior with respect to pH 
in various regions. For example. the slope of the [H,PO.] versus pH line 
is 0 when pH < pK,.1' +1 when pK,.1 < pH < pK,.,. +2 when pK,., < pH 
< pK",. and +3 when pH > pK",. The system points are (pK,.1' pCT,Po).

following example. 
Example 4-22 
Determine the concentration of each phosphate species, OH-and H+ in a 10-3

Solution 
Using Fig. 4·7, the mass balance on Na+, 
C T,Na = [Na+] = 2CT,P04 = 2 X 10-3 
and the proton condition, 
[H+] + [H,PO.-] + 2[H,PO.] = [OW] + [POlo] (4·64) 
(4-65) 
we see that at pH 9.1. [H,PO,-] = [OH-]. and that [H'] and 2[H,PO,] are much less 
than [H,PO, oJ. and [PO.'-] is much less than [OW]. At this pH. [H'] = 10-9.1 M. [OH-] 
= 10-,·9 M. [Na+] = 2 X 10-' M. [H,PO,] = 10-1'-' M. [H,PO, -] = 10-,·9 M. [HPOl-]

The assumption is just acceptable. 
The pC -pH diagrams have so far been used only for solutions containing 
one acid and its conjugate base(s). These'diagrams are equally applicable 
to mixtures of acids as is shown by the following example. 
Example 4-23 
Determine the pH of a solution prepared by adding 10-3 moles of ammonium 
acetate, NH4Ac, per liter of -distilled water. (Note that this solution is identical to 
that which would be obtained by adding 10-' moles of NH,OH (NH,,,J and 10-' 
moles HAc, acetic acid, per liter of water.)

fl 4.10. IONIZATION FRACTIONS AND DISTRIBUTION DIAGRAMS 
I.) On several occasions in the previous section we developed equations 
~ that express the amount of an acid or its conjugate base as a fraction of 
\ the total analytical concentration (e.q .. Eqs. 4-28 and 4-31 for the HCN-CN­
system; Eqs. 4-46. 4-51 and 4-52 for the diprotic acid H,A and Eqs. 4-60 to 
4-63. for the phosphoric acid system). We used these equations. with 
simplifying assumptions. to develop pC-pH diagrams and noted that there 
were pH regions (close to the pK values) where our assumptions broke 
down. The reader should also have noted. probably with some trepidation. 
that the equations were increasing in complexity as the number of protons 
in the acid increased. To simplify the situation. we can introduce the 
concept of an ionization fraction (or a value). Tables of a values as ex 
function of pH may be used to aid computations. Graphical presentation 
of a values as a function of pH-the so-called distribution diagrams---are 
helpful in graphical solutions of equilibrium problems. A table of a versus 
pH is given in Appendix 1. The major advantage of the ionization fraction. 
in addition to its simplicity of expression. is that it is independent of the 
analytical concentration. Therefore. multiplication of the analytical con­
centration by the appropriate ionization fraction at a particular pH value 
will directly produce the concentration of the species at that pH. 
The ionization fraction can be determined from the mass balance and 
equilibrium equations. For example. consider HOCI. which has a pK, of 
7.5 at 25°C. Neglect ionic strength effects. 
CT.oe, = [HOCl] + [OCI-] 
K = 10-7.5 = [W][OCI-] 
, [HOCl] 
Substituting Eq. 4-67 in 4-66 to eliminate [OCI-] yields 
K, 
CT.oe, = [HOCI] + [W] [HOCl] (4-66) 
(4-67) 
(4-68) 
Solving for [HOCl]lC T.oe,. that is. the fraction of CT,oe, which is [HOCl]. we 
obtain 
[HOCl] [W] 
Cr.oe, [H+] + K, = ao (4-69) 
and similarly for OCI-. 
[OCI-] K, = CT,oe, [H+] + K, (4-70) 
The subscript on a refers to the number of protons that the species has 
released. If ionic strength effects are important. 'K, = [H+][OCl-]/[HOCI] 
(= K,/(YH'Yoe,-)) should be used in place of K, in Eqs. 4-69 and 4-70. Ionization Fractions and Distribution Diagrams 135 
Using Eqs. 4-69 and 4-70. or alternatively the table of IX versus pH in 
Appendix I. we can determine lX, .and IX, at various pH values and plot 
them in a distribution diagram as IX versus pH (Fig. 4-9). Distribution 
diagrams for the multiprotic acids. H,S and H,PO,. are shown in Fig. 4-
10; such curves can be obtained using either the table or the general 
equations for IX in Appendix I.

4.11. MIXTURES OF ACIDS AND BASES-pH CALCULATION 
Until ;r;ow we have concerned ourselves with situations in which acids, 
and salts of conjugate bases, have been added singly to distilled water. 
We must now address situations in which we have to predict the nature 
and extent of composition changes that occur when acids, conjugate 
bases, and salts are added to each other. Many important analytical 
methods, natural processes, and treatment schemes involve reactions 
between acids and bases, for example, acid-base titrations such as those 
used for the determination of acidity and alkalinity; the addition of metal 
ion coagulants, or lime for softening or water stabilization in water 
treatment; the neutralization of acid wastes by in-plant base addition or 
by discharge and dilution in surface waters; the production of acid rain; 
the dissolution of minerals by ground waters bearing CO" and so on. 
4.11.1. Strong Acid-Strong Base Mixtures 
The calculation of solution pH after the addition of a strong acid to a 
solution containing a strong base, or vice versa, is very similar to the 
calculations used in Section 4-5 for determining pH in solutions of strong 
acid or strong base. The general approach is to write equations that 
describe the solution after the acid and base are mixed, make simplifying 
assumptions, find the solution to the equations, and then check the 
assumptions. The following example will serve as an illustration. 
Example 4-24 
A 0.1 M NaOH solution is added to 1 liter of 10-3 M HCl solution. What is the 
pH after addition of (I) 5 ml, (2) 10 ml and (3) 20 ml 0.1 M NaOH? The solution 
temperature is 25°C. Neglect ionic strength effects. 
Solution 
Because Hel is a strong acid and NaOH is a strong base. their dissociation in 
aqueous solution is assumed to be complete. The equations needed to solve the 
problem are

a. The volume added is 0.005 liter (5 mI). Substituting (I), (2), and (3) in (4), we

[H+]'-IO-H 10-3 -5 X 10-' 10-' 
[W] ~ 1.005 ~ 5 x 1.005 
This equation, which is a quadratic in [H+]. could be solved exactly. 
However, we can make a simplifying assumption. Since the amount of 
strong acid present (l liter X 10-3 mole/liter = 10-3 moles) exceeds the 
amount of base added (0.005 liter x 10-' molelliter ~ 5 x 10-' moles) we 
would expect the solution to be acid so that [H+] » [OH-]. Neglecting [OH-] 
(~ IO-H/[H+]) in (5), we obtain 
[H+]~5XIO-' 5xlO-'M 
1.005 pH ~3.3 
At this pH, [OH-] ~ 10-"" and the charge balance is satisfied to well within 
5 percent error. 
b. Substituting (2) and (3) into (4) and using a volume of NaOH added of 0.01 liter 
(10 ml), 
or (O.IXO.OI) + [W] ~ [OH-] + 10-3

and from equation (I) pH ~ 7.0. 
At this point we have added a quantity of base equal to the amount of acid 
present (the stoichiometric amount to satisfy the reaction, NaOH + Hel ~ 
Noel + H20); we therefore have a salt solution with a pH of 7. 
c. Substituting (2) and (3) in (4) and using a volume of NaOH added of 0.02 liter 
(20 ml). we find that 
/ (0.1)(0.02) [H+] ~ [OW] 10-3

Since the amount of strong base added exceeds the amount of acid present, 
we would expect the solution to be basic with [OH-] » [H+]. Thus

We can see then that it took 49.9 ml acid to lower the pH from the initial value of 
approximately 13 to pH 10, but a further increment of only 0.1 ml would lower the 
pH by 3 units to pH 7. If ionic strength effects had not been taken into account, 
the same answer would have been obtained for this problem. 
We can perform the calculation shown in Example 4-25 many times 
over and from the data construct a curve of pH versus acid added, Mixtures of Acids and Bases-pH Calculations 139 
expressed either as ml added or as the equivalent fraction, f, the number 
of equivalents of H+ added per mole of base present. This curve is known -- , ....... as ci titratJoir curve. In Fig. 4·" the titration curve for addition of H2S04 
to the spent regenerant solution, as in Example 4·25, is plotted. 
It is apparent that in the region of the equivalence point, or the point 
of stoichiometric addition, the pH of a strong base solution to which a 
strong acid is being added (or vice versa) is very sensitive to the amount 
of acid added. The solution, which is a mixture of a strong base and its 
salt, is poor at resisting changes in pH for incremental additions of acid. 
The solution is thus poorly buffered for pH. Although we will take up the 
subject of buffers in more detail in Section 4·12, it is worthwhile to note 
that a strong acid alone would be a poor choice of neutralizing agent for 
a waste which is primarily a strong base. Because of the wide fluctuation 
of pH for small additions of acid near the equivalence point, process 
control to any desired pH in this region would be very difficult. 
4.11.2. Weak Acid-Strong Ba.se and Strong Acid-Weak Base Mixtures 
The situation with these mixtures becomes slightly more complicated 
than for strong acid.strong base mixtures because we cannot always 
assume complete dissociation of the weak acid or weak base. However, 
the importance of these types of systems far outweighs that of the strong 
acid-strong base system. Most natural waters indeed behave like mixtures 
of weak acids and the salts of strong bases. A consideration of such 
systems will lead us to an understanding of pH buffers and eventually to 
one of the important pH buffering systems in natural water, that is, the 
carbonate system. At first we will examine some simple situations

illustrated by examples. We will use two approaches: the first using pC­
pH diagrams and the second a trial-and-error method. 
Example 4-26 
A solution contains 10-3 moles of acetic acid, HAc. What is the solution pH after 
0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01 liters of 0.1 M NaOH and 0.03 liter of 1M NaOH have been 
added per liter? From these data sketch a titration curve (equivalent fraction, Ii 
added versus pH, and ml added versus pH) and show the relationship between 
the titration curve and the pC-pH diagram. The temperature is 25°C; neglect ionic 
strength effeds. 
Solution 
Since the volume of base added per liter is very small, it is reasonable to 
assume that its addition causes no volume change.9 The general equations are 
as follows, 
1. CT." = [HAc] + [Ac-] = 10-3 M. 
2. CT.N, = number of moles added/sample volume = [Na+] = V(1)(O.I)/1 liter = 
O.IV M. 
3. K, = 10-4.< = [W][Ac-]i[HAc]. 
4. Kw = 10-" = [W][OH-]. 
5. [Na+] + [W] = [OH-] + [Ac-]. 
We use equations (I), (3), and (4) to plot a pC-pH diagram for the acetic acid­
acetate system (CT,Ac = 10-3 M) (Fig, 4-12). To determine the solution pH after each 
NaOH addition, we must first determine Na+ from equation (2) and then substitute 
this value in the charge balcmce, equation (5), The solution for the charge balance 
is obtained by inspection of the pC-pH diagram. For V = 0.0025 liter: From (2) 
[Na+] = O.IV = 2.5 x 10-+ M 
The charge balance becomes 
2.5 x 10-+ + [W] = [OH-] + [Ac-] 
Now assuming [H+] «2.5 x 10-+ and [OH-] « [Ac-], the charge balance becomes 
[Ac-] = 2.5 x 10-4 M. The charge balance solution in the pC-pH diagram can be 
found at pH 4.3, Checking our assumption, we find that [Na+1 = 10-3.6, which is 
not much greater than [H+] = 10-4.3. The approximate solution of the charge 
balance does not work because [Na+) and [H+] are the same order of magnitude. 
We must resort to finding values of ([Na+J + [H+]) from the diagram in the region 
around pH 4_3 and then plotting -log ([Na+] + [WD versus pH. We then can 
determine the pH where -log ([Na+] + [H+D = -log [Ac-], which is the solution 
'If the volume change had not been neglected, CT.Ao = [HAc] + [Ac-] = 
(10-')/(1 liter + V), and CT.N, = [Na+] = (0.1 V)/(1 liter + V). CUo and CT.N, 
values would both change when NaOH is added. The graphical procedure could 
still be used, but a different pC -pH diagram would have to be constructed after 
each addition. Mixtures of Acids and Bd~es-pH Calculations 141 
to the charge balance. From the diagram we see that this ·occurs at pH = 4.4, and 
at this pH our second assumption that [OH-] « [Ac-] 'is acceptable. For V ~ 0.005 
liter: From (2) 
[Na+] ~ (0.005)(0.1) ~ 5 x 10-' M 
The charge balance becomes 
5 x 10-' + [W] ~ [OH-j + [Ac-] 
If we assume that [H+] « 5 x 10-' and [OH-] « [Ac-], tlie charge balance 
becomes [Ac-] = 5 x 10-4, a solution that is met at pH = 4.7. Our assumptions are 
valid at this pH.

The addition of S x 10-' M NaOH has produced S x 10-' M NaAc so that the 
solution fs an equimolar mixture of undissociated HAc and Ac-, Note that this 
occurs at a pH value equal to the pK a of the acid. Finally t note that because Qur 
assumptions were acceptable, the influence of [H+1 and [OH-} on pH changes 
caused by the addition of base are negligible. In other words all of the NaOH 
added to such a mixture can be assumed to react with HAc; and all of any strong 
acid added to such a mixture can be assumed to react with Ac-, that is, 
HAc + OH---> Ac-+ H,O 
or 
Ac-+ H+ --7 HAc 
so that for strong base addition the [Ac-1 concentration is equal to the analytical 
concentration of strong base added. As we shall see later, all of these observations 
are of great importance to the subject of pH buffers. 
For V ~ 0.010. the number of equivalents of OH-added ~ the number of 
equivalents of HAc initially present. 
[Na+] ~ (0.01)(0.1) ~ 10-3 ~ CT." 
Substituting [HAc] + [Ac-] for [Na+] in the charge balance. we obtain 
[HAc] + [WI ~ [OW] 
which is the proton condition for a solution containing CT,Ac moleslliter of NaAc. 
Assuming [HAcl » [H+], we find that the charge balance is satisfied at pH 7.8 in 
the pC-pH diagram where [HAc] ~ [OH-].

The charge balance, equation (5), becomes

If we assume that [H+] « 3 x 10-' and [OH-] » [Ac-I. the charge balance 
becomes [OH-] ~ 3 x 10-'. From the pC .pH diagram the charge balance is 
satisfied at pH 12.S. 
We now have sufficient data to sketch the titration curve, summarizing: 
where For V ~ 0.002Sliter, f = (0.1)(0.002S)/1 X 10-3 ~0.2S; pH ~4.4

The titration curve was plotted in Fig. 4·12. together with the pC-pH diagram. By 
comparing these two plots, the following important observations can be made. 
I. When f ~ O.S, pH ~ pK ,. Any addition of base corresponding to f < 0.5 will 
produce a solution pH between that of the original HAc solution and the 
pKa. Mixtures of Acids and Bases-pH Calculations 143 
2. At f ::'0 0.5 the titration curve has an inflection point. At this pH (= pK a) the 
change of pH for a given addition of strong bo'se is small-the solution is 
very well buffered. 
3. When f ~ 1.0, the pH is that of a 10-3 M NaAc solution. This pH is the 
equivalence point. At this pH value the curve has an inflection point in the 
opposite direction to that at f = 0.5. Here the resistance of·the solution to 
pH change on the addition of strong base (or strong acid) is small-the 
solution is very poorly buffered. 
4. The pH increases very slowly as it approaches the pH of the solution being 
added. 
5. It is useful to compare the strong acid.strong base titration curve in Fig. 4-
11 with the curve for a weak acid.strong base in Fig. 4·12. Note that the 
strong acid.strong base system has no good pH region of buffering corre· 
sponding to that of the weak acid·strong base system. 
We will now examine a strong acid-weak base system using a trial­
and-error method of solution. 
Example 4-27

of 10-3 M HCI and (2) 0.8 liter of 1O~3 M HCI? Estimate the pH before attempting 
to calculate it exactly. Neglect ionic strength effects. The pKa of NH4+ at 25°C is

Before HCI addition, this will be the pH of a 1O~3 M NH3[aq) solution. This can either 
be read from a pC·pH diagram or calculated as in Example 4-14. Roughly

this example, the procedure used here applies equally well to higher­
order polynomials for which the quadratic formula is not applicable. 
In the next section we shall see that there is an even easier approximate 
solution to such problems, based on the assumption of complete reaction, 
that can be used with acceptable accuracy in most instances. 146 Acid-Base Chemistry 
4.12. pH BUFFERS AND BUFFER INTENSITY 
As we have previously stated, a buffer solution is a solution that in 
some way has the ability to maintain a stable composition when various 
components are added or removed. Although pH buffers (solutions that 
resist change in pH on the addition of strong acid. H+. or strong base. 
OH-) are the most commonly talked about buffers. they are by no means 
the only type. Other examples are metal ion buffers. and oxidation­
reduction potential buffers. It is now thought that the mineral composition 
of many natural waters is regulated by a buffer system involving silicates 
(clay minerals such as kaolinite). The pH of about 95 percent of the 
naturally occurring waters is within the range of 6 to 9; constituents such 
as SiO, and K+ are also regulated within very narrow limits. Constant 
and well-regulated pH is essential for the proper functioning of the many 
biological and chemical processes involved in water and wastewater 
treatment. For example. the efficiency of the activated sludge process 
decreases markedly when the pH falls below about 6. In most situations 
this does not present a problem because. as we shall see later. most 
waters and wastewaters are usually well buffered in the pH range of 6.0 
to 6.6 by the carbonate system. There are instances when this is not so. 
For example. in extended aeration activated sludge plants located in the 
low alkalinity. poorly buffered water areas of the northeastern United 
States. significant operation problems can be caused by low pH values. 
In treatment plants in this region the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate 
(nitrification) by the reaction 
NH: + 202;;=" N03-+ H20 + 2H+ 
produces 2 moles of strong acid (H+) for every mole of NH: oxidized. With 
wastewater containing 25 mg NH: -Nil iter. this amounts to the production 
of 
25 mg Niliter x 2 mM H+ 
14 mg N/mM mM N 3.57 mM/liter 
of strong acid. which will destroy 3.57 mM/liter of HC0 3-alkalinity (or 179 
mglliter of alkalinity as CaC0 3)." 
Similar problems are encountered in chemical processes where acids 
(e.g .• alum. ferric chloride) are used as coagulants and precipitants in 
water and wastewater treatment. If any of these processes consume most of 
the alkalinity in a water or wastewater. severe depressions of pH (to values 
of 4 to 5) can occur. 
Just as the bulfering of water results in resistance to pH depression 
upon the addition of strong acid. we can show that pH elevation is 
resisted upon the addition of strong base. In treatment processes such as 
11 See Section 4·13 for a discussion of alkalinity. pH Buffers and Buffer Intensity 147 
water softening and phosphate removal by calcium phosphate precipi­
tation, it is often necessary to raise the pH of ir solution to about I L Field 
scale operating data have shown that the amount of the base, hydrated 
lime (Ca(OH),), required to affect this pH elevation is a direct function of 
the alkalinity and buffer capacity of the solution_ 
In this section we will look at the procedure for determining the pH of 
a buffer solution and then consider methods to predict and determine the 
buffer intensity, or the degree of resistance of a buffered solution to pH 
change_ 
4_12,1. Buffer pH 
A solution buffered at a particular pH value will contain an acid that 
reacts with any strong base added to .the solution and a base that reacts 
with any strong acid added to the solution. The most common method of 
preparing a buffered solution is to add a mixture of a weak acid and its 
conjugate base; the pK, of the acid should be very close to the desired pH 
of the buffer solution for maximum buffer intensity. 
Let us examine the general case when CH• moles/liter of the weak acid 
HA and CN", moles/liter of its conjugate base A-are added to the distilled 
water. The equations describing the system, neglecting ionic strength, 
are

Kw = [W][OH-] 
[Na+] + [W] = [A-] + [OH-] 
Combining Eqs. 4-72 and 4-75 to eliminate [Na+], we obtain

(4-77) 
Equations 4-76 and 4-77 can be substituted into Eq. 4-73 to obtain a 
general expression for pH of the buffer, 148 Acid-Base Chemistry

For most buffer solutions, and almost invariably for prepared buffers,

can be used to determine when this condition is met.) Equation 4-78 then 
becomes

or (CN"') pH = pK, + log C

This equation is commonly used for the preparation of buffer solutions at 
a given pH. When ionic strength effects are important, 'K, should be used 
instead of K, in Eqs. 4-78 to 4-80. 
Example 4-28 
1. From an examination of the equilibrium constants in Table 4-1, determine 
which acid-conjugate base pair should --be used 'to buffer a solution at (i) 
pH 4.7 and (ii) pH 7. What ratio of acid to conjugate base should be used in 
ea<;h of these buffers? 
2. What is the pH of each of these buffers after addition of 10-' moles of NaOH 
per liter of solution if Cr = 10-3 M in each case? 
Solution 
1. (a) Examination of Table 4·1 shows that acetic acid, HAc, with a pK, of 4.7 
should be a good buffer at pH 4.7. Assuming that [H+] and [OH-] are 
small compared to C HAc and C NaAc' we can use Eq. 4-79 or 4·80 to determine 
the ratio of C HAc/C NaAc: 
[H+] 10-0 C"Ao -=--=--=1 Ka 10-4.7 CNaAC 
Note that establishing the buffer pH determines the ratio but not the 
concentration of acetic acid and sodium acetate to use. The concentra­
tions of add and conjugate base are determined by the required ability 
of the buffer to resist pH changes upon addition of strong acid or base, 
or the buffer intensity. 
(b) Examination of Table 4-1 shows that both H,S"" and H,P04-have pK, 
values near 7.0. H2S(aq) is volatile and would be difficult to keep in 
solution, besides which it is toxic and evil-smelling. Therefore, H2P04-pH Buffers and Buffer Intensity 149 
is the better choice. Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid and we are 
interested in the pK a.2 value describing the equilibrium, 
H,PO,-"" HPO;-+ H+ 
We can consider this equilibrium in isolation from the two other 
equilibria if the pKa values 'differ by more than about 2 pH units. This 
condition is met for phosphoric acid wherepK a.1 =2.1, pKa,2=7.2, and 
pK,., =12.3. For pK,.,=7.2, Eq. 4-79 becomes 
2. (a) The initial solution with CT•Ac = 10-3 was prepared using CHAC = CNaAc = 
5 X 10-'. Because [H+] and [OH-] are very small with respect to 
[HAc] and [Ac-] in this region, we can assume that the small o.mount 
of OH-added reacts completely with HAc. Thus [HAc] decreases, and 
[Ac-] increases by the amount of OH-added per liter. (Our check to 
determine whether this approach is valid is to determine if the as· 
sumptions used to develop Eq. 4-80, that is, [HAc] » ([OH] -[H+J) and 
[Ac-] » ([OH-] + [,I+J), are valid at the final pH of the solution.) On this 
basis [HAc] = 5 x 10-' -10-' = 4 x 10-', and [Ac-] = 5 x 10-' + 10-' = 
6 x 10-'. 
Applying Eq. (4-80), we obtain 
[Ac-] 
pH = pK, + log [HAc] 
6 x 10-' =4.7+log4x 10' 
= 4.7 + 0.2 =4.9 
Because [H+] and [OH-] are much smaller than [HAc] and [Ac-] at pH 
= 4.9, the assumption of complete reaction is valid. 
(b) Knowing that CT,P04 = 10-3 M and CN~HPo)CNa~po4 = 0.63, we find that 
CN'H,PO, = [H,PO,-] = 6.1 x lO-'M andCN"HPO, = [HPO;-] = 3.9 x lO-'M. 
After the addition of 10-' mole NaOHlliter, [HPO;-] = 3.9 x 10-' + 10-' 
=4.9x lO-'M, and [H,PO,-] =6.1 x 10-'-10-'=5.1 x 1O-'M. 
4.9 x 10-' 
pH=7.2 + log 5.1 x 10 ' 
=7.2-0.02=7.18 
Again [H,PO,-] and [HPO;-] are much greater than [H+] and [OH-] at 
this pH so our assumption of complete reaction is valid. The reader may 
wish to prove this using the approach given in Example 4·27. 
4.12.2, Buffer Intensity 
Buffer intensity, {3, or buffer capacity, as it is often called, is defined as 
the moleslliter of strong base, C s, (or OH-) which when added to a solution 
causes a unit change in pH. Thus ISO Acid·Base Chemistry 
dCB dCA 
13 = d pH = -d pH (4·81) 
where CA is the molesfliter of strong acid (or H+) added. The buffer 
intensity can be determined experimentally and by computation at 
individual pH values. Experimental measurement involves determining 
a titration curve that shows the course of pH change with moles of strong 
acid or base added. The slope of a titration curve is d pHldV where V = 
ml of X normal acid or base added. The slope of the titration curve can 
be converted into 1/13 by multiplying by the factor C', where 
C' = «sample volume, liters)/(normality of titrant))(lD' mlfliter) 
Thus 
C' (d pHldV) = d pHldC B = 1/13 
Therefore, the reciprocal of the slope of the titration curve is proportional 
to the buffer intensity. For example, the titration curve for 10-3 M HAc 
(Fig. 4.12) is reproduced in Fig. 4·14 together with a plot of 13 derived from 
slope measurements on this curve. 
We can generally conclude that the buffer intensity is a maximum at 
pH = pK" that is, when [Ac-] = [HAc] and that 13 is at a minimum when 
f = I. when [HAc]'oltJ" = C B, at the equivalence point of the titration of 
HAc with a strong base. Although we have learned all of these facts 
previously, a knowledge of the absolute value of 13 helps us to design 
buffers at a given pH with the desired capacity to resist pH change. It is 
in this aspect of buffer design that the computational method for deter· 
mining 13 is most usefuL 
To develop a general equation for 13, let us consider a solution containing

if the neutralization system is to continuously produce an effluent with a pH 
sufficiently close to 6, calculate the NaOH and NaHCO a required to achieve the 
neutralization. Neglect ionic str~ngth effects.13 
Solution 
Calculate the NaHCO, required using Eq. 4-99: 
f3 = 2.3([H+] + [OH-] + "o",CT.co, + ",,,,CT.CO,) 
From Appendix I at pH = 6. "0 = 0.666 = [H,CO;)/CT.Co,. '" 0.334

CT.co, = 1.42 X 10-' M 
Thus 1.42 x 10-' mole NaHCO, must be added per liter of waste to achieve the 
desired buffer intensity. 
Next we calculate the required NaOH. In the waste there are 10-1.6 moles 
H+/liter (1.58 x 10-' mole!1iter). Adjustment of the solution to pH 6 requires that 
(1.58 x 10-' -I x 10-') = 1.58 x 10-' mole H+!1iter be neutralized. The H+ con­
centration neutralized by NaHC0 3 via the reaction 
HCO,-+ H+ .... H,cO;

4.13. THE CARBONATE SYSTEM 
We will now turn our attention to a discussion of what is the most 
important acid-base system in water: the carbonate system. The chemical 
species lhat make up the carbonate system-gaseous CO" CO,(,,; aqueous 
or dissolved CO,. CO,( •• ,; carbonic acid. H,C0 3; bicarbonate, HCO,-; 
carbonate, CO,'-; and carbonate-containing solids-comprise one of the 
major acid-conjugate base systems in natural waters. Because of this the 
analytical techniques for measuring the capacity of a water to neutralize 
strong acid and strong base (alkalinity and acidity. respectively) are 
based largely on the specific properties of the carbonate system. The 
carbonate species also buffer natural watt'rs. In addition, individual 
species are of interest to us because they participate in important 
reactions other than strictly acid-base interactions. Carbon dioxide is a 
participant in the biological processes of respiration (CO, produced) and 
biosynthesis by autotrophs or photosynthetic organisms (CO, consumed). 
The dissolution of CO, from the atmosphere into water and the release 
of CO, from supersaturated waters involves a heterogeneous reaction 
between gas and liquid phases. Carbonate ion participates in hetero­
geneous equilibria with solids containing carbonate, notably calcium 
carbonate. The formation of CaCO, precipitates is one of the bases of the 
precipitation process for water softening. The dissolution of carbonate­
bearing minerals is a major source of inorganic carbon-containing species 
in natural waters. Carbonates and bicarbonates form complexes and ion 
pairs with metals such as Ca'+ and Mg'+. Because of their almost 
universal occurrence and involvement in reactions, the carbonate species 
almost always has a bearing on the type and quantity of chemicals 
required to treat water and wastewater. 
4.13.1. The Carbonate Species and Their Acid-Base Equilibria 
The various components of the carbonate system are interrelated by 
the following equilibria. (For the moment we will neglect the equilibria 
between carbonate species and metal ions and the involvement of The Carbonate System 157 
carbonate·containing solids (see Chapters 5 and 6)). The temperature 
dependence of the constants we will use most· frequently is presented in 
Table 4-7.

When we are presented with a problem involving the carbonate system, 
we must first make a decision concerning the nature of the system. This 
step is important because carbonate species can be involved in homo· 
geneous solution equilibria as well as heterogeneous gaslliquid and 
Iiquidfsolid equilibria. We must examine our system to see whether it 
can be treated as 
I. An open system with no solid present. 
2. An open system with solid present. 
3. A closed system with no solid present. 
4. A closed system with solid present. 
The use of simple sketches helps us to decide the nature of our system. 
For example, 
I. A water sample containing carbonate species is titrated with a 
strong acid. During titration the sample is warmed and vigorously 
bubbled with air to equilibrate the sample with the atmosphere.

From Eq. 4·104 we can conclude that the concentration of hydrated

acid, H,C0 3• 
K = 10-,·6 = [H,C03] 1.6 X 10-3 
m [CO"",] 
Thus [H,C0 3] is only 0.16 percent of [CO"aq,]' Because it is difficult to 
distinguish between CO"aq, and H,C0 3 by analytical procedures such as 
acid·base titration, a hypothetical species (H,CO;) is used to represent 
H,C0 3 plus CO",q,' We will follow this convention. Using Eqs. 4·103 and 
4.104, we can determine the ionization constant. K,., for H,CO; as follows: 
Since 
[H,C0 3] + [CO"ad = [H,CO;] (4·108) 
where H,CO; is a hypothetical species only, and neglecting ionic strimgth 
effects, the equilibrium constants for ionization of H,CO; and H,C0 3 can 
be wrjtten as 
[W][HC03-] 
[H,CO;] and [W][HC0 3-] = K; 
[H,C03] 
Substituting Eq. 4·108 in the Ka" equation, we obtain 
[W][HC03-] 
Ka" = ([H,C03] + [CO"aq,]) (4·109) 
Now multiplying the numerator and denominator of Eq, 4·109 by [H,C0 3] 
and knowing that [CO",q,]/[H,C0 3] = I/Km, we find that

The implications of this development are important because they point The Carbonate System 161 
out that H,C03 is a fairly strong acid, (K; = 10-3.5), but there is very little 
of it in solution. This point is emphasized because the composite first 
dissociation constant, K"l' for H,CO; is 10-•. 3, a value that would give the 
impression that carbonic acid is a very weak acid. As we shall see later 
when we examine the dissolution. of minerals'by CO" carbonic acid has 
some of the properties of a strong acid. Because of the preceding 
equilibrium calculations and because [CO",q,] » [H,C0 3], we can write 
(4-110) 
Although equilibrium calculations justify the use of the hypothetical 
species, H,CO;, there are some kinetic consideratio,!s that must be 
addressed. A simple experiment will illustrate the problem." 
Take 200 ml of chilled distilled water and add a piece of dry ice (solid 
CO,) to it to increase its dissolved CO, content. Add 3 to 4 drops of 
bromothymol blue indicator, which is yellow below pH 6, green at pH 7, 
and blue at pH 8 and above. The indicator will turn yellow in the chilled 
CO, solution. Now add I to 2 ml of 0.1 M NaOH (strong base) and swirl 
the flask to mix. The solution will be momentarily (seconds) blue, then 
return to its original yellow color through an intermediate shade of green. 
These color changes indicate that after the addition of strong base the pH 
of the solution was at pH above 8 for a significant time and then gradually 
returned to below pH 6. For .some reason then, the strong base that was 
added to the solution was not neutralized, or remained unreacted, for a 
measurable time period. If we recall our earlier discussions on kinetics, 
we realize that slow reaction rates are not characteristic of acid-base 
reactions. The explanation for this behavior lies in the slow (relative to 
other deprotonation reactions) rate of hydration of aqueous CO,. The 
reaction, CO",q, + H,O "" H,C0 3 has a rate constant of 0.0025 to 0.03 at 
20 to 25°C. By chilling the solution as we did in our experiment, the rate 
is slowed even further. From our equilibrium discussions we know that 
CO",q, is the major dissolved CO, species. However, it is the minor 
species H,C0 3 that participates in acid-base reactions with OH-
H,C03 + OH-..... HC03 -+ H,O 
This reaction, like most acid-base reactions, is extremely rapid. Therefore, 
on the addition of excess OH-, the available H,C03 is consumed at a 
faster rate than it can be produced. The result is that the pH increases 
momentarily until the slower CO, hydration reaction can supply more 
H,C0 3 to react with the OH-. 
The reason for the slow hydration rate lies in the change of molecular 
configuration that must occur in CO, hydration. The CO",q, molecule is

with associated waters of hydration. 
Throughout this text we will use the hypothetical species H,CO; to 
represent CO""' plus H,C0 3• We will treat it as a diprotic acid, but we 
should keep in mind its true nature. 
4.13.2. Calculation of Carbonate Species Concentrations in Open and 
Closed Systems 
In working problems concerned with carbonate equilibria in waters, 
we can take one of two general approaches. The first method is to treat 
the problem rigorously. This procedure often leads to complex equations. 
The second method is to make simplifying assumptions to provide an 
easy but approximate solution. We intend to present both ways of 
attacking the problem because it is only by having a fundamental 
knowledge of the system that one can develop the ability to make rational 
simplifications. 
First. let us examine homogeneous (no precipitates), open systems. In 
these systems the carbonate species in solution are in equilibrium with 
the CO, gas in the atmosphere above the solution. The normal atmosphere 
contains 10-3.5 atm of CO" and when this is in equilibrium with CO",., 
from Eqs. 4-103 and 4-110. we obtain 
(4-111) 
Let us now construct a pC -pH diagram for the carbonate system open 
to an atmosphere containing Pca, = 10-3.5 atm (Fig. 4-16). Our first step is 
to determine the concentration of each carbonate species as a function 
of pH. From Eq. 4-111, [H,CO;] =10-5, 
-log [H,CO;] = 5 
Therefore, [H,CO;] versus pH plots as a horizontal straight line at

from Fig. 4-16, determine Cr.co, as a function of pH using Eq. 4-116, and 
plot -logCr.co, versus pH. The resulting curve is shown in Fig. 4-16. Note 
that [H,CO;] predominates for pH < pK,.l' [HC0 3-] predominates for 
pK,., < pH < pK,.2' and [CO,'-] predominates for pH > pK",. Examination 
of Fig. 4-16 also reveals that Cr.co, increases rapidly as pH increases 
above pK"l' 
Now let us tackle the closed system, with a Cr,co, = 1O-5M. Since the 
constraint that the system be in equilibrium with a certain partial pressure 
of CO2{,) has been removed, we can treat H2CO; as a nonvolatile diprotic 
acid. Thus construction of the pC-pH diagram follows the same steps 
taken in Section 4-8 for the diagram of the hypothetical diprotic acid H2A 
(Fig. 4-5). The diagram is shown in Fig. 4-17. 
Let us first determine the composition of 10-5 M solutions of H2CO;, 
sodium bicarbonate, NaHC03, and sodium carbonate, Na2CO, in both 
systems. The proton conditions for the closed system are

These proton conditions are met at points A, B, and C, respectively, in 
Fig. 4·17. The concentrations of the various species in these solutions as 
taken from Fig. 4·17 are tabulated in Table 4-8. 
The calculations are slightly more complex for the open system. Because 
CO2 can enter the solution or be evolved, Cr.co
J is an unknown. To make 
comparisons with the closed· system solution, let us consider (I) distilled 
water, (2) distilled water + 10-5 mole NaHCO,iliter, and (3) distilled water 
+ 10-5 mole Na,CO,iliter, each in equilibrium with the atmosphere. When 
atmospheric CO, is in equilibrium with distilled water, Henry's law gives 
[H,CO;t. 
The proton condition is [H,CO;] = KHP co, 
10-1.5 X 10-3.5 = 10-5 M 
[W] = [HCO, -] + 2[CO,'-] + [OH-]

The addition of 10-5 mole NaHC03/liter of distilled water followed by 
equilibration with the atmosphere at 25°C results in the following charge 
balance 
(4-117) 
where [Na+] = I x 10-5• Figure 4-16, which is applicable to open systems. 
shows that this equation is satisfied at pH 6.3 (point B) where [Na+] = 
I X 10-5 = [HC03-], [H+] « 10-5, and [HC03-] » 2[CO,'-] + [OH-]. The 
concentrations of the various species at this pH are presented in Table 
4-8. 
When 10-5 M Na,C03 is added to distilled water, the same charge 
balance, Eq. 4-117 results but [Na+] is now 2 X 10-5 M. Using Fig. 4-16, we 
find the charge balance is satisfied at pH 6.6, where [Na+] = 2 X 10-5 = 
[HC0 3-], [Na+] » [H+] and [HC03-] » 2[CO,'-] + [OH-]. The species 
concentrations at this pH. taken from Fig. 4-16, are also given in Table 
4.8. 
Comparison of the closed and open systems in Table 4·8 reveals the 
following important distinctions 
l. In the open system [H,CO;] remains constant. 
2. The pH of a 10-5 M CO""' solution and of a distilled water solution 
that is equilibrated with the atmosphere is equal. It would be a 
useful exercise for the reader to experimentally determine the pH 
value of distilled water immediately after preparation and then 
again after standing the distilled water overnight in a beaker open 
to the atmosphere. For freshly distilled water the pH should be only 
slightly below neutrality while after contact with the atmosphere 
containing 10-3•5 atm (Peo), the pH will drift down to the neighbor­
hood of 5.7. 
3 .. The CT•eo, concentration is constant in the closed system but varies 
with pH in the open system. 
4. Even though the NaHC03 and Na,C0 3 solutions in the open system 
contain higher CT•eo, than the NaHC03 and Na,C03 solutions in the 
closed system, their pH values are significantly lower. We can 
conclude that equilibration of closed solutions of NaHC03 and 
Na,C0 3 with the atmosphere will cause a depression in pH. If we 
were to bubble a 10-5 M Na,C0 3 solution with air containing 
Peo, = 0.0003 atm (10-3.5 atm), then over a prolonged period its pH 
would drift down from 9 to about 6.6. 
Let us now turn our attention to the calculation of solution composition 
following the addition of strong acid or strong base to the closed carbonate 
system. The results and methods that we derive from this exercise will The Carbonate System 167 
prove useful in (I) calculating solution composition during water treatment 
operations where strong acids or bases are 'added to carbonate-bearing 
waters in processes such as coagulation and stabilization, (2) assessing 
pH and solution composition when acidic wastes are discharged to 
receiving waters, and (3) calculating the pH and solution composition at 
various stages of the alkalinity and acidity titrations. We will demonstrate 
methods of calculating the solution pH and composition following strong­
acid or strong-base addition when the analytical concentration of car­
bonates, Cr,coJ, is known. 
Example 4-31 
Calculate the solution pH, solution composition, and the equivalent fractions, 
I, of titrant for a solution containing 10-3 M Na2C03 to which are added 
l. 10-3 mole HN03 per liter of solution. 
2. 2 X 10-3 mole HN03 per liter of solution. Assume that a negligible volume ........ 
change occurs as a result of the addition of HN03 and that the system is 
closed. 
Solution 
1. The eqUivalent fraction is calculated as 
f = number of equivalents of HNOa addedJIiter 1 x 1O~3 
CT•C03 1 x 10 3 
To determine the solution composition, we need the mass balance, the 
charge balance, and the appropriate pC -pH diagram.

CT•CO,= [H,COjJ + [HCO,-J + [CO,'-J = 10-' 
[Na+J -[NO,-J = [HCO,-J + 2[CO,'-] + [OH-] -[W] 
After substituting from mass balances on [Na+] and [N03 -], we can write 
10-' = [HCO,-J + 2[CO,'-J + [OH-] -[WJ 
which is the charge balance for a 1O-~3 M NaHC03 solution. We can also substitute 
[H,CO;J + [HCO, -] + [CO,'-] for 10-' in the charge balance to obtain 
[H,CO;J + [WJ = [CO,'-J + [OW] 
which is the proton condition for a solution prepared by adding only NaHC03 to 
distilled water. From the pC.pH diagram for a closed system with CT,cos = 10--3 168 Acid-Base Chemistry

Substituting mass balances on Na+ and N03 -in the charge balance. we can write

or 
This is the proton condition of a 10-3 M H2CO; solution. It is satisfied at pH 4.7 in 
the pC-pH diagram (Fig. 4-18), where [fi+] = [HCO,-] and [HCO,-] »2[CO,'-] + 
[OH-]. The solution composition is [H+] = 10-'-', [OH-] = 10-"', [H,CO;] = 10-', 
[HCO, -] = 10-"', and [CO,'-] = 10-10.,. 
Similarly, it can be shown that if one equivalent fraction of strong base 
is added to a solution containingC r.co, moleslliter of H,CO;, the pH of a 
solution with the same Cr,co, but made up with only NaHC0 3 results, 
pHHCO,-; if two equivalent fractions of strong base are added, the pH of a . 
Cr.co,-molar solution of Na,C0 3, plico,'-, results. 
The application of pC-pH diagrams for closed system problems is most 
useful when the initial solution pH corresponds to a pure carbonate 
solution (i.e., pHco, for an H,CO; solution, pHHCO,-for an NaHCO, solution 
and pHco,'-for an Na,C0 3 solution) and the amount of strong acid or 
strong base added is equal to one or two equivalent fractions. Such cases 
are the exception; however, our coverage of these simple examples has 
hopefully instilled into the reader's mind the nature of the assumptions 
that can be made in various pH regions of the carbonate system. 
Generally, when strong acid or strong base is added to solutions con­
taining carbonates, the initial pH does not correspond to pHco" pHHCO,-, 
or pHco,'-and the amount of acid or base added does not correspond to 
f = I or 2. 
Example 4-32 
A solution contains 10-3 M Cr.col and has a pH of 7.0. No weak acids or weak 
bases are present other than the carbonate species. but other anions and cations 
aTe present. Neglecting ionic strength effects, calculate the pH after addition of:

We can see that the assumptions are valid. 
Approximate Solution 
The strong acid added (10-4 mole HClIliter) is assumed to react completely with 
only the strongest base. HCO,3-, which is present at significant concentration. 
(The bases OH-and COl-are stronger, but their concentrations are at least 2

pH = 6.73 
This approximate solution is in excellent agreement with the exact solution. 
The assumption of complete reaction can be made when the concentration of the 
predominant acid and its conjugate base pair is much greater than the H+ or OH­
concentrations. Whether this estimate will be valid can generally be judged very 
easily using the appropriate pC-pH diagram and the estimated pH; alternatively, 
the solution obtained in this way can be checked using the set of equations that 
describe the system. 
2. Addition of 3 x 10-4 moles NaOHlliter. 
This problem can be solved in the same fashion as given in (l). The 
approximate solution is slightly different, however, and it is as follows: 172 Acid·Base Chemistry 
Approximate Solution 
The strong base is added in an amount (3 X 10-4 M) greater than the initial 
IH2COj] (= 1.7 X 10-4 M). We assume that the strong base first reacts stoichio· 
metrically with all of the H,CO; (the [WI is negligible), then any remaining OH­
reacts with HCOa -. the weaker acid; thus the reactions. 
H,CO; + OH--> HCO,-+ H,O and HCO,-+ OH-->CO,'- + H,O 
are both important. Also we can deduce that our final solution will not contain 
a significant amount of H2CO;, since we assume that it has all reacted with the 
added OH-. Therefore. we should examine the Ka,2 equation for relationships 
between concentrations of the major species. that is. HC03 -and COl-.

The approximate solution approach is especially useful in certain 
practical problems, such as the one illustrated in the following example. 
Example 4-33 
A stream has a pH of 8.3 and a CT,C03 of 3 x 10-3 moles/liter. A wastewater 
containing 1 X 10-2 M H2S04 is to be discharged to the stream. What is the most 
waste that can be discharged per liter of stream water, and the corresponding 
dilution ratio, if the pH may not drop below 6.7? 
Solution 
At pH 8,3, pHHco3-' essentially all of the carbonates are in the form of HC03-. 
At pH 6.7, the ratio of [HCO,-] to [H,CO;] can be determined from the K",

H+. We can define alkalinity and acidity in two ways: operationally and 
a~alytically (or mathematically). Let us first examine the operational 
definition of alkalinity and then proceed to see how this is related to the 
mathematical definition when the components of the solution contributing 
to the alkalinity are only carbonate species and OH-. 
In the determination of total alkalinity a known volume of sample is 
titrated with a standard solution of a strong acid to a pH value in the 
approximate range of 4 to 5 and usually in the range 4.5 to 4.8. This 
endpoint is commonly indicated by the color change of the indicator 
methyl orange; therefore, the total alkalinity is often referred to as the 
methyl orange alkalinity. The H+ added is the stoichiometric amount 
required for the following reactions: 
H++OH-¢H20 
H+ + HCO, -¢ H2CO; 
2H+ + C01-¢ H2CO; 174 Acid·Base Chemistry 
The pH at the true endpoint of the total alkalinity titration should be that 
of a solution of H2CO; and H20. Since we will assume that the alkalinity 
titration is a closed system (no atmosphere), the solution at the endpoint 
of the titration should be an H2CO; solution wlth a CT.CO, that equals the 
CT.CO, of the solution being titrated. We refer to the pH of such a solution 
as pHco" and we call the solution a CT.co;molar solution of CO2, 
For the carbonate system we can theoretically identify two more 
significant pH values that occur during the course of an alkalinity titration. 
These are pHHco,· and pHco,'·. They represent, respectively, (I) the pH of 
solution to which has been added the stoichiometric amount of H+ required 
to complete the following two reactions: 
W + OR-:;=: H20 
(i.e., the solution will have the pH of a CT,co,molar HC03 -solution), arid 
(2) the pH of a solution to which has been added the stoichiometric amount 
of H+ required to complete only the following reaction: 
W + OR-:;=: H20 
In the lalter case, the carbonate species will be present all as CO,'-, or 
as the form that results when CT,co, moles of Na2C03 is added to H20 (i.e., 
the pH of aCT.co,-molar C032-solution). The value of pHHco,· is about pH 
8.3 while pHco ,. is generally between pH 10 and II and varies with , . 
CT,COl' 
It is possible to determine experimentally the amount of acid required 
per liter of solution to lower the pH of a solution to pHHco,·. This is the 
carbonate alkalinity. This endpoint can be determined with a pH meter 
or by the color change of the indicator phenolphthalein so that it is often 
referred to as the phenolphthalein alkalinity. The amount of acid required 
to reach pHco,'· (the caustic alkalinity)·cannot be determined readily in 
the laboratory because of the poorly defined eRdpoint, caused by the 
masking effect of the buffering of water (i.e., the reaction H+ + OH-... 
H20). Caustic alkalinity can be determined by calculation if the carbonate 
and total alkalinity are known. 
Example 4·34 
A sample of water from the overflow of the recarbonation basin that follows a 
precipitation/softening process has a pH of 9.0; 200 ml of the water require 1.1 ml 
of 0.02 N H,S04 to titrate it to the phenolphthalein endpoint and 22.9 ml of 0.02 
N H2S04 to titrate it further to the methyl orange endpoint. Assuming the sample 
contains no calcite particles, what are the total and carbonate alkalinities of the 
sample in meqlliter and the total alkalinity in mglliter as CaC03? 1 r 1 \ *-') . The Carbonate System 175

If we make the previous approximation of complete reaction and 
combine it with the assumption that the alkalinity of a water is due solely 
to carbonate species and OH-, we can, to a good approximation, make 
some deductions about the initial composition of a solution from the 
alkalinity titrations. Thus we assume that ~ti2!!s

is complete. We can also deduce that each mole of CO,'-present will ~ consume one H+ when the solution is titrated to pH 8.3 and another H+ as 
it is titrated from pH 8.3 to approximately pH 4.3. If the volume of acid to 
reach pH 8.3 (Vp) was equal to the volume of acid required to proceed from 
pH 8.3 to pH 4.3 (V mol, we would know that the original solution contained 
only CO,'-as the major alkalinity species. 
If, when we put phenolphthalein indicator into the solution, it imme· 
diately became colorless (or if the pH was below about 8.3) and we then 
required an acid volume of V mo to reach about pH 4.3, the original solution 
would have contained only HCO, -as the major species contributing to 
alkalinity. 
If the initial solution required V p ml of acid to reach pH 8.3 but no 
further acid addition was required to reach pH 4.3, the alkalinity was due 
to OH-alone. By similar reasoning we can show that if V p > V mo' then the 
major alkalinity species are OH-and CO,'-; if V mo > V" then the major 
alkalinity species are CO,'-and HCO, -. The third possible combination 
of major alkalinity·causing species, OH-and HCO,-, does not exist 
because there is no pH range over which these two species are concurrently 
the major alkalinity species (see Fig. 4.18). It should be emphasized that 176 Acid-Base Chemistry 
the concentrations obtained by this procedure are approximate and 
significant errors are introduced if the solution pH is greater than about 
9.5. These relationships are tabulated in Table 4-9.

We can make similar definitions and calculations concerning acidity 
measurements. For a water in which acidity is contributed solely by H+ 
and carbonate species, the endpoint of the total acidity titration is at a 
pH where a stoichiometric amount of OH-has been added to complete 
the following three reactions: 
OH-+ W "" H20 
OH-'+ HC03 -"" C032-+ H20 
20H-+ H2CO; "" C032-+ 2H20 
The species present at the endpoint pH are those which result when 
Na2C03 equal to theCT,co, of the sample, is added to pure water. This pH 
is pHco,'-and is generally between 10 and I L The carbon dioxide acidity 
endpoint is at pHHco,-, about 8.3. The mineral acidity endpoint is at 
pHco" about pH 4 to 5. In the analysis of waters the two endpoints used 
in acidity determinations are pH 8.3 (pHHco3-) and pH 4-5 (pHco). As in the 
caustic alkalinity determination the pHco,'-endpoint is ill defined. Since 
the endpoints at pH 8,3 and pH 4 to 5 correspond, respectively, to the 
color changes of the indicators phenolphthalein and methyl orange, 
carbon dioxide acidity is referred to as phenolphthalein acidity and 
mineral acidity is often called methyl orange acidity.'7 
Using the assumption of complete reactions; we can deduce that adding 
base to achieve a pH of 4 to. 5 will allow the completion of the reaction 
H+ + OH--> H20 
and the carbonate species will be in the form that exists when CO2 is 
added to pure water. Addition of strong base to pH 8.3 will complete the 
reactions 
and 
H2CO; + OH--> HC03 -+ H20

system are present, pH 3.7 is used instead of pH 4 to 5, See Standard Methods,

Example 4-35 
Two hundred and fifty ml of a freshly sampled well water (approximately pH 
6.7) requires the addition of 5-Jl ml 0.1 N· NaOH to raise its pH toJU" the same 
volume of the water requires the addition of 1"2.2 mi W;"o) of 0.1 M Hel to lower its 
pH to 4.3. What are (!) the total alkalinity arid total acidity, (2) the carbon dioxide 
acidity. and (3) the approximate concentrations of the major carbonate species? 
Solution 
1. Total alkalinity is based on the volume of titrant required to lower the pH 
of the sample to the methyl orange endpoint, which is approximated by pH 
4.3 in this problem. 
Total alkalinity = 12.2 ml x 100 meqlliter xl/250 ml sample volume 
= 4.88 meqlliter 
Total acidity is equivalent to the amount of strong base which must be 
added per liter to raise the pI;I to pHC032-. In doing so the following reactions 
will essentially be completed, 
H+ + OH--> H,Q 
H,CO; + OH--> HCO, -+ H,O 
and 
HCO,-+ OR--> CO,'-+ H,O 
Although we are not given the volume of titrant to pHc~2-, we can deduce 
this from the information given. The pH of the sample is approximately 
6.7; thus mineral acidity is absent and we can disregard the first reac· 
lion. It takes 5.8 ml of 0.1 N NaOHl250 ml sample to complete the second 
reaction and raise the pH to 8.3. To complete the third reaction, a further 
5.8 mU25D ml is required to conver! the HC03 -formed via the second reac· 
tion to CO/-. In addition, the HC03-present in the sample (which ti· 
trated as total alkalinity) will need to be converted to C032-during 
the total acidity titration. This will require an additional 12.2 ml of 
D.l N NaOHl25D ml sa~ple, an amount equivalent to the strong acid required 
in the total alkalinity titration. The total amount of base added then is 5.8 7 
+ 5.8 + 12.2 = 23,8 j:\lU250 ml sample. ~ -
~------------- . t 1 
Total acidity = 23:8 ml x 100 meqiliter x 250 ml sample volume 
= 9.52 meqlliter18• 
18 Note that total acidity can also be calculated with the aid of Fig. 4·19. That is, 
total acidity = CO2 acidity + I eq fraction = CO2 acidity + CT.COl, where 
CT.coJ = CO2 acidity + total alkalinity. Sin~e 5.8 ml of 0.1 N titrant was required 
to titrate to the CO2 acidity endpoint and 12.2 ml of 0.1 N titrant was required 
to titrate to the total alkalinity endpoint, total acidity = (5.8 + 5.8 + 12.2) x 
lOa eqiliter x (1/250 sample volume) = 9.52 meqiliter. IBO Acid-Base Chemistry

4.13.4. Alkalinity and Acidity Endpoints 
We have been careful in the preceding discussion of alkalinity and 
acidity titrations and calculations to refer to the pH of the various 
endpoints" as "approximate values." The actual values that correspond 
to pHco" pHHco,-, and pReo,'-are not truly fixed values, rather they vary 
with the CT•CO, in solution. If we treat the titrations as closed systems, the 
CT•CO, at the endpoint will be the same as theC T•co, in the initial solution. 
This appears to be a reasonable approach if the solution is not shaken 
vigorously and if the titration is conducted rapidly. The variation in 
equivalence point pH values is shown in Fig. 4-20. 
Reference to Fig. 4-20 and the statement in Standard Methods (14th ed.) 
that "the following pH values are suggested as the endpoints for the 
corresponding alkalinity concentrations as calciUm carbonate: pH 5.1 for 
total alkalinities of about 50 mg/liter (1.0 meq/liter), pH 4.8 for 150 mqlliter 
(3 meqlliter) and pH 4.5 for 500 mg/liter (10 meq/liter)" shows that this 
variation is significant indeed for pHeo,. Figure 4-20 shows that PReOl­
also is strongly dependent on CT•CO, whilepHHco,- is much less dependent. 
19 The reader should keep in mind the difference between endpoint pH and 
equivalence point pH. The equivalence point pH is the theoretical pH at which 
a titration is complete while the endpoint pH is an approximation of the 
equivalence point pH. The Carbonate System lSI

a closed system as a function of the initial total carbonate concentration. 
The equivalence point pH values can be calculated exactly using 
previously presented methods, especially the one employing the pC·pH 
diagram (e.g., see Section 4.12.2). Here we will examine approximate 
methods for their calculation. For pHeo" we will check the rationale 
behind the Standard Methods statement quoted previously. 
At the total alkalinity (and mineral acidity) equivalence point, we 
assume that there is present an H2CO; solution of concentration CT,coa 
which is equal to CLeo, of the sample prior to titration. Therefore, at the 
endpoint, 
[H,CO,] = CT•eo, 
Considering only the K ,.1 equation 
K _ [H+][HCO,-] 
,.1 -[H,CO;] 
and assuming [H+] = [HCO, -], which is the approximate proton condition 
for an H,CO, solution, 
[H+] = (K",CT.Co,l'12 
For a total alkalinity of 50 mgiliter as CaCO, (l meqiliter) and an original 
sample pH between 7.5 and 9, 
[HCO, -] = I x 10-' M 
Titration to pHeo, will produce a 10-' M H,CO; solution with an [H+] of 
[H+] = (l0-6., X 10-')112 = 10-4.65 
pH = 4.65 182 Acid-Base Chemistry 
Similarly, for a total alkalinity of 150 mg/liter as CaCO, (3 meq/liter), we 
obtain 
PHea, ~ 4.5 
and for total alkalinity of 500 mg/liter as CaCO, (10 meq/liter), 
pHea, = 4.2 
The Standard Methods endpoint values are higher than the closed 
system pHea, values, perhaps indicating that some allowance has been 
made for the escape of CO, during the titration that would result in a 
lower H,CO; concentration at the endpoint. 
The variation of pHea, with CT.ea, has led to alkalinity titration methods 
(employed in Europe) in which the majority of the acid is added, the 
solution is boiled to expel CO" and then, after cooling, the small amount 
of remaining acid is added. The pH of the endpoint is then at about pH 
5.1 and is independent of alkalinity, since it is governed solely by the 
small amount of CO, generated from the last small acid addition plus the 
CO, in the atmosphere. If a sample is warmed and bubbled with nitrogen 
gas (free of CO,) during titration, the equivalence point would be the pH, 
where [H,CO;] ~ a and [H+] = [OW] which at 25°C is pH 7. 
The pHHea,-equivalence point (for carbonate alkalinity and carbon 
dioxide acidity) is at about pH 8.3 and varies relatively less than PHea, 
with CT,ea,. 
Since at pHHea,' we have an HCO, -solution, the proton condition is 
[H+] + [H,CO;] = [OH-] + [CO,'-] 
or approximately, since at pH > 7, [H+] < [OH-] , 
[H,CO;] = [OW] + [CO,'-] 
Substituting for these terms fromK,." Kw, andK", respectively, we find 
Solving for [H+] and recognizing [HCO, -] ~ C T.ea,' we find that 
[H+] = (KwK",) 1/' + (K K )'12 
C a,1 a,2 
T,C03 
The first term becomes insignificant compared to the second term when 
CT,ea, > IO-'M. Thus for CT.ea, = 10-' M, 
[H+] ~ (10-6., X 10-10,')'12 ~ 10-8., 
pH= 8.3 
For the range of alkalinities in which most natural waters fall (10" to The Carbonate System 183 
10-' M ·or 50 to 500 mg/liter as CaCO,), pHHCO,· will be very close to 8.3. 
At extremely low alkalinities, as Fig. 4·20 shows, the pH will be less than 
8.3. 
The pHco,'-endpoint (for caustic alkalinity and total acidity) is between 
pH 9-11 and varies significantly with CT.co, as shown in Fig. 4·20. Since 
at pHco,'· we have a CO,'-solution, the proton condition is 
2[H,CO;] + [HCO,-] + [W] = [OH-] 
At pH » 7, [H,CO;] and [H+] are negligible so that [HCO,-] = [OH-]. 
Substituting from K,., and K wand recognizing [CO,'-]· = CT.co, when 
CT.co, > 10-', we find 
[W] = (KwK,.,),,, 
CT•C03 
For values of C T.CO, < 10-', pHco,'· can most easily be determined by using 
the pC.pH diagram. 
4,13.5. Analytical Definition of Alkalinity and Acidity 
Alkalinity and acidity are defined on the basis of the constituent bases 
and acids, respectively, which contribute to the alkalinity and acidity. 
The various alkalinity and acidity measurements are defined in term" of 
the proton conditions of the equivalence points to which the alkalinity 
and acidity determinations dre measured. Alkalinity requires the addition 
of strong acid (H+). Thus the presence of alkalinity with respect to a 
particular endpoint indicates an excess of species containing less protons 
than the reference (or endpoint) species over species containing more 
protons than the reference species. Acidity requires the addition of strong 
base (OH-), which is tantamount to removing protons. Thus the presence 
of acidity with respect to a particular endpoint indicates an excess of 
species containing more protons than the reference species over species 
containing less protons than the reference species. Table 4·10 summarizes 
the various equivalence points, their proton conditions, and the associated 
mathematical definitions of acidity and alkalinity for a water containing 
only the carbonate species, OH-and H+ as buffering components. Each 
of the mathematical definitions of alkalinity and acidity can be expressed 
in terms of a values; see Table 4-11. 
From these expressions we can see that for systems which are buffered 
by carbonate species, H+, and OH-alone, there is a definite relationship 
between total alkalinity, pH, and CT.co, and between total acidity, pH, 
and CT.co,. For such systems, if two of these quantities are measured, the 
third can be calculated. Since many natural waters can be treated as 
though they were solely buffered by carbonate species, H+, and OH-, the 
determination of initial pH and either total alkalinity or total acidity will 
allow the computation of CT.co, and all species. '" ... TABLE 4-10 Alkalinity and Acidity Equations and Equivalence Points

We can use the mathematical definition of alkalinity to provide an exact

complete reactions. We found that the total alkalinity = 2.4 x 10-3 eq/liter and the 
initial pH was 9.0. 186 Acid-Base Chemistry

The relationship between alkalinity, CT,co, and pH has been used by 
Deffeyes to construct a diagram relating alkalinity to C T,CO, at a series of 
constant pH values, This diagram, shown in Fig. 4-21, can be used for a 
wide variety of calculations involving the addition and removal of various

If two of the three characteristics, pH, CT.co" and total alkalinity, of a

addition or removal causes a 45° movement, since 1 equivalent of 
alkalinity and I mole of C I.CO, is added or removed per mole of HCO,-. 
Carbonate addition or removal causes a 600 (211) movement from the 
horizontal. since 2 equivalents of alkalinity and I mole of C T.CO, are added 
or removed per mole of CO,'-. Dilution decreasesCT.co, and alkalinity to 
the same extent and therefore results in a 450 downward movement in the 
diagram. Armed with these tools. we can use the Deffeyes diagram to 
solve rather complex problems. 
Example 4·39 
A water with an alkalinity of 82.5 mglliter as CaCO, and a pH of 8.0 is treated 
with C12{gl to oxidize NH3(aq) to nitrogen gas (breakpoint chlorination). If the initial 
ammonia concentration is 3.5 mg NH3-Nlliter, and the product of dmmonia 
oxidation is N2 gas, what is the pH, total alkalinity, andeT.col-following treatment? 
What combination of NaOH and NaHCO, must be used to adjust the pH of the 
treated water to 9.0 and the CT•C03 to 2.0 mM? 
Solution 
The original water sample contains (82.5 mglliter as CaCOj(50 mg/meq)) = 1.65 
meq/liter of total alkalinity. The water characteristics. 1.65 meqlliter alkalinity 
and pH 8.0 are located at point B on Fig. 4·21. 
The reaction of chlorine with NHa to produce N2{g) is 
2NH, + 3CI, ... N,Io' + 6W + 6CI-
Thus I mole of NH,-N produces 3 moles of H+ (strong acid) or 14 g NH,-N produce 
3 moles H+. Thus 3.5 mg NH,-Nlliter produces 3 x (3.5 X 10-' glliter)/(l4 g/mole) 
or 0.75 X 10-' mole of Wlliter. 
The effect of addition of 0.75 X 10-3 mole H+/liter of solution, CA. is to move 
vertically downward from point B, 0.75. meqlliter in the diagram to point C. 
The characteristics of the treated water are thus pH = 6.4, total alkalinity = 
0.9 meqlliter, and CT.Co, = 1.65 mM. 
The point pH 9.0 andCT,C~ = 2.0 mM lies above an upward 45° movement in the 
diagram from point C. To adjust the sample composition to the point, we first 
satisfy the CT,coJ requirement of the final water by adding NaHC03 to point D and 
then adding NaOH (Ca) to move vertically upward from point D to point E, the 
desired final water. The required additions are 
20 This is an important point that the reader can verify using the alkalinity 
equations, Table 4-8. It is also an important consideration in sampling because 
CO2 release or uptake after a sample is taken hut before total alkalinity is 
measured will not affect the total alkalinity value. The Carbonate System 189 
NaHCO,(CtoD) ~0.35mM 
NaOH(DtoE) ~0.75'mM 
Since NaOH + NaHCO, -> Na,CO" 0.35 roM Na,CO, and (0.75 -0.35) ~ 0.4 roM 
NaOH could be added instead to produce the same effect. 
Further examination of the expressions in Table 4·10 allows the follow· 
ing useful relationships to be established: 
Total alkalinity -carbonate alkalinity ~ CT,co, (4.118) 
Proof 
From Table 4·10, 
[HC03-] + 2[CO,'-] + [OH-] -[H+] + [H,CO;] + [H+] -[OW] -[CO,'-] 
~ [H,CO;] + [HCO, -] + [CO,'-] 
= CT,C03 
Similarly, 
Total alkalinity + carbon dioxide acidity = CT,C03 
and 
Carbon dioxide acidity -mineral acidity = CT,C03 (4·119) 
(4·120) 
In each of these equations both of the capacity parameters can be readily 
determined by titration with a strong acid or base. The relationship in Eq. 4-118 
is applicable for waters with pH > 8.3; Eq. 4-119 is useful for waters in the pH 
range 8.3 to 4,3 and Eq. 4·120 applies to waters with pH below 4.3. The diagram 
in Fig. 4-19 also shows these relationships. 
By employing these relationships, we can compute CT,C03' the initial pH, and 
individual alkalinity or acidity species based solely on the two appropriate 
titration values. 
Example 4-40 
A 25°C water sample requires 10 ml 0.02 N H,SO, to lower the pH of 100 ml to 
4.3. The same volume of water requires 4 ml 0.02 N NaOH to raise its pH to 8.3. 
Compute the total inorganic carbon content, CT ,c0J' the initial pH, and the 
concentrations of [H+], [OH-], [H,CO;], [HC03-], and [CO,'-] in the initial water 
sample assuming that alkalinity and acidity are solely due to the carbonate 
system, H+ and OH-. 
Solution 
Titrations are for total alkalinity and carbon dioxide acidity. 
Total alkalinity ~ 10 ml x 0.02 eqlliter x I~O ml sample volume 
= 2 x 10-3 eq/liter 
Carbon dioxide acidity = 4 ml x 0.02 eq/liter x I~O ml sample volume 
~ 8 x 10-' eqlliter 190 Acid·Base Chemistry 
From Eq. 4·119, 
Total alkalinity + carbon dioxide acidity = C T,COl 
C"co, ~ 2.8 X IO-'M 
From Table 4·11, 
Total alkalinity ~ C,.co,(a, + 2a,) + [~:] -[H +] 
10--14 
2 X 10-' ~ 2.8 X 10-'( a, +2 a,) + [H+] -[H+] 
Assume 2a2 « a1. since the pH is less than 8.3, ander.col » [OH--] -[H+]. 
2 X 10-' 
a, ~ 2.8 X 10' 0.71 
From Appendix 1. the pH ~ 6.7. At pH 6.7, from Appendix 1. "0 ~ 0.285. ", ~ 0.715. 
Thus 
[H,CO;] ~ a,f:: ,.co, ~ 0.8 X IO-'M 
[HCO,-] ~ a,CT.co,~2 X IO-'M 
Within the limits of accuracy of Appendix 1, a2 = O. However, we can use [HC03--1 
and [H+] as calculated together with K ,., to find [CO,'-] ~ 5 X 10-'. 
Alternatively, knowing the total alkalinity (= 2 x 10-3) and having calculated 
Cr.coJ (= 2.8 X lQ--3), we can use the Deffeyes diagram. Fig. 4-21. to obtain the pH 
of 6.75. 
If bases other than the carbonates and OH-are present that react with 
protons in the pH range of the alkalinity and acidity titrations, we cannot 
use these calculations and diagrams without modifications. In addition 
the analytical definition of acidity and alkalinity must be changed to 
incorporate these bases. The following reactions are important in this 
regard in waters and wastewaters. 
Silica (silicic acid): 
H,SiO, "'" H,SiO,-+ H+ 
Boric acid: 
H,BO, + H,O "'" B(OH),-+ H+ 
Dihydrogen phosphate:

4.7 The Carbonate System 191 
Many other organic acids important in water chemistry have pK, values 
similar to that of acetic acid, for example', propionic acid and butyric 
acid. Many natural waters contain silicates and organic bases that 
contribute to the total alkalinity. Wastewaters contain substantial quan­
tities of organic bases, ammonia, and phosphates. Anaerobic digester 
supernatant often contains high concentrations of bases similar to acetate, 
as well as carbonates, ammonia, and phosphates. For very complex 
systems for which a detailed chemical analysis is not available, no 
attempt is made to work with the mathematical definition of alkalinity. 
However. if the system is chemically defined we can show that these 
substances will contribute to alkalinity if, during the titration, some of 
the base is converted to the conjugate acid. We can modify the total 
alkalinity definition to include these species so that 
Total alkalinity, eqiliter = [OH-] + [HCO, -] + 2[CO,'-] + [H,SiO,-] 
+ [B(OH), -] + [HPO.'-] + [NH,] + f'[Ac-] -[W] (4-121) 
where f' is the fraction of [Ac-] titrated at the total alkalinity endpoint. 
H,SiO,-, B(OH),-, HPO.'-, and NH, will each be completely converted to 
their conjugate acids. In terms of a values this expression becomes 
Total alkalinity, eq/liter = [OH-] + a,.CO,C T,co, + 2a,.co,C T,co, 
+ a,.S'C T•S, + a,.SC T•S + a"PQ,C T•PO, (4-122) 
+ lX'1.NH3CT,NH3 + (a1,AC -CX1.Ac)C T,AC -[H+] 
where a:,AC' is the fraction of CT•M present as Ac-at the endpoint of the 
titration. 
Example 4-41 
The East Bay Municipal Utility District, California, obtains water from the 
Mokelumne River. In January 1968 the total alkalinity of the treated and distributed 
water was 20 mglliter as CaCOa• the pH. was 9.65, and the silica content was 8 
mg/liter as SiOl' What fraction of the total alkalinity is contributed by the silicate, 
by the carbonate system, and by the hydroxide? Here pKa,s/ = 9.5. 
Solution 
Totalalkalinity(eqiliterl = (20 mgiliter as C~~O, mg CaCO,lmeql X 10-' eq/meq 
= 4 X 10-' eqiliter 
From Eq. 4-122, 
Total alkalinity = !X,.copr,co l + 2a2.copr,col + [OR -1 + iX,.SlCr,Sf -[H+] 
CT." = 8 mgiliter as SiO,l60 X 10-' mg SiO,imole 
= 1.33 x 10-' M 
At pH 9.65, from Appendix L ",-SI = 0.58, 
K 10-" [OH-] = [H~] = 10-"" = 10-4." = 4.44 X 10-5 M 192 Acid-Base Chemistry 
Thus 
Silica in the form of H3Si04-= a,CT,Si = 0.58 x 1.33 x 10-4 
= 0.77 x 10-' eqlliter 
Alkalinity due to silicate = 0.77 X 10-4 eq/liter 
( 0.77 x 10-') = 4 X 10' X 100 = 19.2 percent 
Alkalinity due to hydroxide = 0.44 X 10-' eqiliter 
( 0.44 x 10-') = 4 x 10' x 100 = II.0percent 
Alkalinity due to carbonate and bicarbonate =100 -(19.2 +11.0) 
= 69.8 percent 
Therefore, in this water a significant fraction of the total alkalinity (almost 20 
percent) is due to the silicate system. 
Many interesting aspects of the carbonate system occur in connection 
with heterogeneous systems containing carbonate solids and soluble 
carbonate complexes. These topics are dealt with in the next two chapters.

5.1. INTRODUCTION 
Complex formation is important in the chemistry of natural waters and 
wastewaters from several standpoints. Complexes modify metal species 
in solution, generally reducing the free metal ion concentration so that 
effects and properties which depend on free metal ion concentration are 
altered. These effects include such things as the modification of solubility 
(see Section 6-5), the toxicity and possibly the biostimulatory properties 
of metals, the modification of surface properties of solids, and the 
adsorption of metals from ~olution. 
Complex formation is used extensively in water analysis. The deter­
mination of hardness, Ca'+ and Mg'+ concentration, employs the com­
plexation of these metals with the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetra­
acetic acid (EDT A); the titrimetric finish of the chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) test uses the complexing agent I.IO-phenanthroline to detect the 
presence of Fe2+ and so indicate the endpoint; chloride analysis by. the 
mercurimetric method depends on the formation of the complex 
HgCl~{ao) between Hg2+ and the chloride ion. 
The objective of this chapter is to present sufficient background infor­
mation to enable the student to underslCl{ld the principles of complex 
formation and stability. Methods for calculating the concentrations of 
complexes in fairly simple systems are presented; the approaches to 
calculating species distribution in more complicated systems are dis­
cussed together with the results of such computations. A discussion of 
complex formation in several dilute aqueous systems is presented to 
illustrate important points. The effect of complexation on solubility is the 
major topic in Chapter 6. 
5.2. NOMENCLATURE AND DEFINITION OF TERMS 
Coordination compounds or complexes consist of one or more central 
atoms or central ions, usually metals, with a number of ions or molecules, 
called ligands, surrounding them and attached to them. The complex can 
be nonionic. cationic. or anionic, depending upon the charges of the 
central ions and the ligands. Usually, the central ions and ligands can 
exist individually as well as combined in complexes. The total possible 
number of attachments to a central atom or central ion or the total possible 198 Coordination Chemistry 
number of coordinated species is referred to as the coordination number. 
Ligands are attached to the central species by coordinate covalent bonds 
in which both of the electrons participating in the bond are derived from 
the ligand. Thus we can regard the central species as an electron acceptor 
and the ligand as an electron donor. The central species is a Lewis acid 
and the ligands are Lewis bases.' Since metal ions have an affinity for 
accepting electrons, they all form coordination compounds, with a tend· 
ency that increases as the electron-accepting affinity of the metal ion 
increases. Molecules and ions with free electron pairs tend to form 
complexes whose strength is a function of their ability to donate or share 
that pair of electrons.' 
There are a few basic rules to follow in naming complexes,3 Ligands 
are named as molecules if they are neutral. If they have a positive charge, 
the suffix" -ium" is used; if the group is negative, the suffix" -0" is used, 
Exceptions to this are the terms "aquo" for H,O and "am mine" for NH3. 
The prefixes "di-, trio, tetra-," and so forth are used to indicate the number 
of ligands. The characteristic suffix for anionic complexes is "-ate"; there 
are no characteristic suffixes for cationic and neutral complexes. The 
oxidation state of the central metal ion is generally given in parentheses 
following the name of the complex, (I), (II), (-I), and so forth. These rules 
are illustrated by the following examples: 
Fe(CN),'-, hexacyanoferrate(lI) ion. 
AI(H,O),3+, hexaaquoaluminum(III) ion. 
Cu(NH3),2+, tetraamminecopper(1I) ion. 
MgC03', carbonatomagnesium(lI). 
CaSO,', sulfatocalcium(II). 
The superscript "0" on the magnesium and calcium complexes indicates 
the complex is uncharged. . 
The coordination number of a metal ion may vary from one ion to 
another. For example, Ni(II) has a coordination number of 4 in its complex 
with carbonyl (CO), Ni(CO)r; with 1,IO-phenanthroline in the complex 
Ni(phenanthroline),2+ the coordination number is 6. lron(III) has coordi­
nation numbers of 6 for water, Fe(H,O),3+, and cyanide, Fe(CN),3-, but 4 
for chloride, FeCl,-. 
1 Substances that can accept a pair of electrons are called Lewis acids and 
substances that can donate a pair of electrons are called Lewis bases.

Wiley, New York, 1967. 
3 See F. Basolo and R. G. Pearson for a more complete discussion of nomenclature. Nomenclature and Definition of Terms 199 
Ligahds that attach to a central metal ion at only one point, such as 
H,O, OH-, CI-, and CN-, are called monodentate ligands. Ligands that 
attach at two or more sites are multidentate ligands or chelating agents. 
The complex formed by a chelating agent and a central metal ion is 
known as a chelate. Chloride, for example, forms a monodentate complex 
with mercuric ion, while carbonate and sulfate can occasionally be 
bidentate-attaching to a central metal ion at two sites: 
o / , 
M C=O ,/ o o 0 /'.,f' M S ,/'\­o 0 
The chelating agent EDTA'-can attach at six sites, since each of the 
acetate groups and the two nitrogen atoms have free electron pairs 
necessary for coordinate bond formation. For example, the EDTA complex 
with Ca2+ that forms during the titrimetric determination of water hardness 
is 
Each mole of the chelating agent 1,IO-phenanthroline, which is used as 
an indicator for Fe'+ in the titrimetric finish of the COD test, can satisfy 
two coordination sites with the electron pairs on the two nitrogen atoms 
in each molecule. With Fe'+ a red-colored complex is formed with three 
molecules of 1,IO-phenanthroline satisfying the coordination number of 
6 for the Fe'+ ion:

Complexes containing one central ion are called mononuclear com­
plexes; when there is more than one central ion or molecule the complexes 200 Coordination Chemistry 
are 1?0lynucJear complexes. When aluminum ions are added to water 
buffered at about a neutral pH, there· is evidence that polynuclear 
hydroxoaluminum(III} complexes form from the condensation (dehydra­
tion) of mononuclear hydroxoaluminum(lII) complexes:

The bond strength of metal ion complexes varies considerably. Weakly 
associated complexes that have one or more layers of water between the 
ligand and the central ion are known as ion pairs, for example, CaC0 3', 
CaHC0 3+, CaSO,', CaOH+, MgC0 3', and MgSO,o. In these compounds, 
the degree of interaction is only slightly greater than the electrostatic 
interactions accounted for by the DeBye-Hiickel theory. 
5.3. REACTION RATE 
The rates of coordination reactions are characterized by the terms labile 
(very fast reactions) and inert (very slow reactions). It is important to 
understand that these terms do not, in any way, indicate the stability of 
a complex. They describe the kinetics of the interaction of ligands and a 
central ion; complex stability is described by the magnitude of the 
equilibrium constant of the reaction by which a complex dissociates into 
its component central ion and ligands. An inert complex is not necessarily 
stable. that is, it does not necessarily have little tendency to dissociate. 
For example, the tetracyanomercurate(II} complex, Hg(CN}f-, is labile but 
very stable; while the reverse is true for the tetracyanonickelate(II) 
complex, Ni(CN}f-, which is inert and unstable.' 
The substitution reaction in which a ligand replaces a coordinated 
water molecule to form a complex in aqueous solution,

4 R. G. Wilkins, The Study of Kinetics and Mechanism or Reactions of Transition 
Metal Complexes, Allyn and Bacon, Boston, 1974. L Complex Stability and Equilibrium Calculations 201 
is virtually complete within seconds to minutes at typical natural water 
concentrations (!O~' M) for the following coinbinations of central metal 
ion (M) and ligand (L):

Substances that are not complexes, for example, methylmercury, HgCH, +, 
will not undergo ligand replacement reactions. 
For the same reaction, if Fe'+ is the metal and CI~ is the ligand several 
hours are required, but if Fe'+ has an OH~ attached to it, that is, FeOH'+, 
only minutes are required. The reaction between Fe3+ and SO.'~ or SCN~, 
on the other hand, requires only minutes. 
Notable exceptions to the statement that coordination reactions occur 
rapidly are the reactions involving replacement of H,O from Cr(H,O),3+ by 
ligands such as SO.'~, which take days to years. Changes in the structure 
of polymeric metal hydroxide species may take weeks. 
5.4. COMPLEX STABILITY AND EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS 
Equilibrium constants for-complexes are usually stated for reactions 
written in the direction of complex formation, that is, 
Ligand + central metal ion"" complex 
For example, for the am mine copper complex, 
NH3(,q, + Cu'+ "" Cu(NH,)'+ 
and 
{ Cu(NH,)"} _ +4 _ _ . . 
{Cu'+ }{NH3(,q,} -10 -K -stabIlity constant 
When stated for a complex formation reaction, the equilibrium constant 
is called a formation or a stability constant. Conversely, if the equilibrium 
constant is stated for the dissociation of the complex it is called a 
dissociation or an instability constant. Large values of stability constants 
indicate stable complexes. 
It is difficult to formulate general rules, or scales of strength, for 
complex stability because so many exceptions to the rules exist. However, 
some general statements can be made that aid in predicting what will 
take place in aqueous solution. A·metal cations, including the alkali 
metals, Na+ and K+; alkaline earth metals, Mg'+ and Ca"; and other ions 
such as AI'+ and Si4+ preferentially coordinate with ligands containing 
oxygen as the electron donor, such as carbonate, hydroxide, borate, and 
so forth. Other metal ions, of the so·called B-metals, which include Ag+, 202 Coordination Chemistry 
Zn'+, Hg'+, Pb'+, and Sn'+, show a stronger tendency to form complexes 
with'ligands containing S, P, or N as donor atoms, such as ammonia, 
sulfide, and phosphite, rather than with oxygen-containing electron 
donors. Within these groups of metal ions, complex stability is propor­
tional to the charge of the metal ion. Alkali metals form the least stable 
complexes and indeed rarely complex with any ligand except H,O, while 
the transition metal ions, for example, CrN, Cr'+, Fe'+, Fe'+, and Ni'+ 
have a strong tendency to form complexes with a wide variety of ligands. 
Ligands also differ in their ability to form stable complexes. The ligands 
phosphate, hydroxide, carbonate, and so forth, are potent complex formers 
while the perchlorate, CIO,-, and nitrate, NO,-, ions show very little 
tendency to form complexes. It is for this reason that nitrate or perchlorate 
salts are used as swamping electrolytes in experiments where it is 
desirable to have a constant ionic strength.' ' 
We can also make some general statements about the stability of 
chelates. Coordination compounds containing five-and six-membered 
rings are the most stable. For example, EDTA'-and I.IO-phenanthroline 
complexes with five-membered rings are more stable than some carbonate 
and sulfate complexes that have four-membered rings. The stability of a 
chelate generally increases with an increase in the number of points of 
attachment between the chelating agent and the central metal ion. For 
example, the complexes formed between Cu'+ and the compounds ethy­
lenediamine.

5 For a more extensive discussion of the complexing ability of metal ions and 
ligands, see the following references: S. Arhland, S. J, Clatt, and W. R. Davies, 
Quart. Rev. (London) 12: 165 (1958); and W. Stumm and J. J. Morgan, Aquatic 
Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1970. Complex Stability and Equilibrium Calculations 203 , 
have stability constants, respectively, of -10", -1016, and _1020. The 
phenomenon of increasing complex stability 'with the increasing number 
of attachments is called the chelate effect. 
If we introduce a ligand that forms complexes with two metal ions into 
a solution containing equal concentrations of the two metal ions, the 
ligand will form complexes preferentially with the metal ion that produces 
the complex with the larger stability constant. The titration of hardness 
with EDTA illustrates this point. The chelating agent, EDTA'-, is gradually 
added (by titration) to a solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. The following 
complex-forming reactions can occur: 
Ca2+ + EDTA'-"" (EDTA-Ca)'­
Mg2+ + EDT A'-"" (EDTA-Mg)'-K = 10+10•7 
K = 10+8·7 
Because the stability constant of the (EDTA-Ca)2- complex is two orders 
of magnitude greater than the stability constant of the (EDTA-Mg)2-
complex, the reaction between EDTA'-and Ca2+ is virtually complete 
(i.e" all Ca2+ is complexed) prior to any reaction between EDTA'-and 
Mg2+. 
Another aspect of complex equilibria that can be understood using a 
knowledge of stability constant values is the converse of the previous 
situation, that is, the competition of a number of ligands for a single 
metal ion rather than the competition of a number of metal ions for a 
single ligand. The complex with the largest stability constant again forms 
preferentially. When a ligand that forms a v,,"ry stable complex with a 
metal ion is added to a solution of the metal ion complexed with another 
ligand in a less stable complex, the stronger complexing agent (ligand) 
will tend to decompose the existing complex and withdraw the metal ion 
into a complex with itself. The weaker complex must be sufficiently labile 
for this to occur. This fact is used in the titration of hardness with EDTA. 
The solution to be titrated (containing Ca2+ and Mg2+) is dosed with the 
complexing agent Eriochrome Black T (EBT), or comparable substance, 
which forms a complex with Mg2+ as follows: 
=a0H OH O-Mg--O 
S03H 0 N-N~ + Mg2+ ","S03Hg-J \N~O + 2W 
O,N 0 0 lSJlU1 O,N 
EBT (blue) 
[EBT-Mg][Wl' 
[EBT] [Mg2+] 
We can note two things from the above equations: EBT-Mg (red) 204 Coordination Chemistry 
I., The EBT-Mg complex (K = 10+7) is weaker than the EDTA-Mg complex 
(K = 10+8.,), 
2, The color of the EBT ,Mg complex is red and the color of uncomplexed 
EBT is blue, Thus when the EBT-Mg complex is destroyed by, for 
example, adding EDTA, the color of the solution will change from 
red to blue. It should be possible to detect the endpoint when all 
of the EBT -Mg complex has been destroyed. 
In the total hardness analysis, EDTA is added from a buret into the 
solution containing Ca2+ and the EBT-Mg complex, We have seen previ­
ously that EDTA forms a stronger complex with Ca2+ than with Mg2+ so 
that the EDTA will first react to form an EDTA-Ca(II) complex. Only when 
virtually all the Ca2+ has been complexed will the EDTA start to decompose 
the EBT -Mg(II) complex. The completion of the reaction with EBT -Mg is 
heralded by the color change from the red of the EBT-Mg complex to the 
blue of free EBT. It signifies the endpoint of the titration at which all of 
both the Ca2+ and Mg2+ (total hardness) have reacted with the EDTA 
titrant. 
For complexes that contain more than one ligand or central metal ion, 
there are two ways of writing stability constants. Stepwise formation 
constants are equilibrium constants for the reactions in which the central 
metal ion consecutively adds one ligand. An overall formation constant 
is the equilibrium constant for the reaction in which the central metal ion 
combines with all of the ligands necessary to form a specific complex. 
We can illustrate these two types of constants using the formation 
constants of the chloromercury(II) complexes as an example. For stepwise 
formation we have 
Hg'+ + CI-:o= HgCI+; logK,=7,15 
HgCI+ + CI-:o= HgCI,'; log K, = 6.9 
HgCl,' + Cl-:o= HgCJ,-; logK3 = 2.0 
HgCI3-+ CI-:o= HgCll-; logK4=0.7 
and for the overall formation reactions we can write 
Hg'++CI-:o=HgCI+; log{3,=7.15 
Hg'+ + 2CI-:o= HgCI,'; log {3, = 14.05 
Hg'+ + 3CI-:o= HgCI3-; log {33 = 16.05

whereK, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction in which the complex 
containing "i" ligands is formed from the complex containing "i -I" ligands 
and {3, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction in which the complex Complex Stability and Equilibrium Calculations 205 
containing i ligands is formed from the metal ion and i ligands. Although 
either type of constant (but not both) may be used to determine the 
concentrations of the various complexes in solution, it is somewhat safer 
to use the stepwise formation constants. The inexperienced User may not 
remember all of the complex species that can be formed when using the 
overall formation constants. Such an omission is not possible when the 
stepwise formation constants are used. 
When one or more of the intermediate species is unknown (or their 
stability constant value is not defined), we are forced to use the overall 
formation constan!. For example, for the series of complexes formed 
between the hydrated ferric ion, Fe(H,O).'+, and the hydroxide ion we 
have 
Fe(H,O).'+ + OH-"" Fe(H,O),OH'+ + H,O; K 1 
Fe(H,O).(OH)2+ + OH-"" Fe(H20).(OH), + + H20; K,

Fe(H20),(OH)30"Q' + OH-"" Fe(H,O),(OH), -+ H20; K, 
The concentration of the species Fe(H,O)3(OH),O"Q) which exists in solution 
is unknown so that while K, and K, are defined, K3 and K, are not.

Note that it is common to omit the H,O ligands when writing equations 
such as those give" here. For example. Fe(H,O),(OH)2+ is usually written 
as Fe(OH)'+. We generally follow this practice throughout the remainder 
of this text. 
The procedures for calculating species concentration in a solution 
containing metal ions and ligands are similar to that used for acid·base 
problems in Chapter 4; these procedures are illustrated in the following 
example. 
Example 5-1 
The COD analysis employs mercuric sulfate, HgS04, as a source of Hg2+ to 
complex CI-ion and so prevent its oxidation to CI2(aQ) by K2Cr207 during the 
analysis. Typically. 0.4 g HgSO, is added to 20 ml of sample along with 40 ml of 
other reagents. If a sample contains 1000 mg CI-/liter, what will be the concen· 
tration of each chloromercury(Il) complex and of the free Cl-ion in the solution? 
Recall that in the COD analysis the sulfuric acid concentration is 50 percent so 
that the pH is very low « 1) and hydroxomercury(II) complexes are not important. 
Neglect ionic strength effects and assume a temperature of 25°C. 
Solution 
The unknowns are [Hg2+J. [CI-J. [HgCI+J. [HgCI,~,,,J. [HgCI3-J. and [HgCl/-J. 
[H+] and [OH-] are not of importance because they do not enter into reactions 
with Hg2+ or CI-under the conditions of the COD test, Six equations are needed. 
These are the mass balances on Hg and Cl and the four equilibrium equations.

We will use a trial and error approach to solve this problem. We will make 
certain assumptions, find a solution, and then check the assumptions against the 
results. If the assumptions do not check out, we will make new assumptions and 
try again. Complex Stability and Equilibrium Calculations 207

We can see immediately that the assumption is not valid, since the concentration 
of each complex for exceeds the values of both CT,H9 and CT,CI' Even though the 
calculated concen~rations of the chloromercury complexes are for too high, we 
can glean some useful information from this otherwise disappointing result. We 
see that the concentration of theHgCI0 21aG) complex is larger than the concentrations 
of the other complex species and that CI-is much less than the concentrations 
of all the complexes. Using this information, let us assume that the HgCI02laG) 
complex is the sole important Cl.containing species. The CI mass balance now 
becomes 
or 
(HgCI20IaQI] = 10 -2.32 
Since Cr,Hg > ~CT.CJ' we must assume that some free [Hg2+] is present~there is 
just not enough Cl-to complex it all. We therefore assume that the important Hg. 
containing species are Hg2+ and HgCI02laQ). 
The Hg mass balance becomes 
Then 
From Eq. (4) CT,H9 = 10-1.65 = [Hg2+] + [HgC12\'G}]

Substituting this set of values into the mass balance equations for Cl,)-Ig and Cl,CI 
shows again that the calculated concentrations are still too high. Examination of 
the new values shows [HgCl +] to have a value close to that of [HgCI 2°1<lQ)}' 
Therefore, it should not be neglected. Taking this into account, the mass balances 
become

Combining Eqs, (4') and (6') to eliminate [HgH] and solve for [CI-], we find [CI-] 
~ 3 X 10-' M, Substituting this value in Eq, (5') and solving for [Hg'+] yields [Hg'+] 
~ 1.42 X 10-' M, 
Using these values for [CI-] and [HgH] in Eqs, (3), (4), (5), and (6), ;;e obtain 
[HgCI+] ~ 6 X 10-' 
[HgCI,'",,] ~ 1.59 x 10-' 
[HgCI,-] ~ 4,3 x 10-' 
[HgCI,'-] ~ 6 x 10-16 
Checking our assumptions in Eqs. 0) and (2), we see that the values obtained 
satisfy these equations to within 3 percent accuracy. 
This example shows that the majority of the chloride is tied up as HgCl+ 
and HgCl,'"", with minor amounts present as other chloromercury(Ii) 
complexes and a very small amount (3 x 10-8 M) as the free Cl-ion, 
The implication of this calculation for the COD analysis is that the 
oxidation of chloride can be almost completely excluded, since K,Cr,O, 
will not oxidize any of the chloromercury(II) complexes, If we were to 
conduct a COD analysis on the 1000 mg Cl-/liter solution in the absence 
of HgSO, the following redox reaction would proceed:' 
6e-+ l4H+ + Cr,O,'--> 2Cr'+ + 7H,O 
(2CI--> Cl,,,,, + 2e-) x 3 
Cr,O,'-+ l4H+ + 6Cl--> 2Cr'+ + 3CI,,,,, + 7H,O 
6 See Chapter 7 for an extensive discussion of oxidation-reduction reactions. Hydrolysis of Metal Ions-H,O and OH-as Ligands 209 
Since we express the COD result in terms of the equivalent amount of 
oxygen to complete the oxidation, and express the result as "mg O,/liter," 
it is productive to write the redox reaction in terms of oxygen: 
4CI---7 2CI",q, + 4e-
4e-+ 4H+ + 0,--7 2H,0 
4H+ + 4CI-+ 0, --7 2CI, + 2H,0 
Thus 32 mg of 0, will oxidize 4 x 35.5 (= 142) mg of CI-. If we assume that 
the entire 1000 mg Cl-/liter is oxidized, a COD of 32 x 1000/142 = 225 mg/ 
liter will result. 
In the presence of sufficient HgS04 the COD of 1000 mg Cl-/liter is very 
small, but not zero, because there is some oxidation of the Cl-present in 
equilibrium with chloromercury(II) complexes. This oxidation removes 
CI-from solution and forc';s further dissociation of the complexes. For 
example, 
HgCl,·"q,;:= Hg'+ + 2Cl-
Cripps and Jenkins' found that the extent of this oxidation was a function 
of the duration of the COD digestion. The longer that the oxidation was 
allowed to proceed, the greater the extent of chloromercury(Il) complex 
dissociation and the greater was the COD due to CI-oxidation. Formulated 
as an empirical "chloride correction factor," they found that the COD due 
to Cl-oxidation was 0.00041 X mg Cl-/liter X time of digestion in hours. 
5.5. HYDROLYSIS OF METAL IONS-H,O AND OH-AS LIGANDS 
In aqueous solution, free metal ions are complexed with water. The 
metal ions are said to be hydrated. The interaction of these hydrated 
metal ions with acids and bases is a ligand exchange reaction that is 
commonly called hydrolysis, or protolysis. These terms describe the 
general reaction in which a proton is transferred from an acid to water, 
or from water to a base. This type of reaction involving hydrated metal 
cations as the proton.donors or acids occurs readily and is of extreme 
importance in natural waters. For example, the stepwise hydrolysis of 
the aquoaluminum(III) ion can be represented by the following series of 
equations: 
Al(H,O),3+ + H,O;:= Al(H,O),OW+ + H,O+ 
Al(H,O),OW+ + H,O;:= Al(H,O).(OH), + + H,O+ 
Al(H,O)4(OH), + + H,O;:= Al(H,O),(OH)3(" + H,O+ 
Al(H,O),(OH)3(" + H,O;:= Al(H,0),(OH)4- + H30+ (5·9)

Saline Waters," J. Water Pollut. Control Fed .. 36: 1240-1246 (1964). 210 Coordination Chemistry 
From these equations it is easy to visualize that the hydrolysis of metal 
ions is a stepwise replacement of coordinated molecules of "water of 
hydration" by hydroxyl ions. In Eqs. 5-9 to 5-12 this replacement occurs 
by the transfer of protons from waters of hydration to free water molecules 
to form an hydronium ion. The hydrolysis reaction can also be written as 
the replacement of a water of hydration by a hydroxyl ion. as was done 
for the hydrolysis reactions of Fe'+ in Section 5-4. The two ways of writing 
the reaction are essentially the same because they can be interconverted 
by using the reaction for ionization of water, 
K, = 10' 
AI(H,O)s'+ + H,O "" AI(H,O),(OH)2+ + H,O+; K, = 10-' 
Note that the equilibrium constants are different but that each defines the 
relationship between [AI(H,O)s'+] and [AI(H,O),OH'+] as a function of pH. 
Equilibrium constants of the hydroxocomplexes of some metal ions of 
importance in water chemistry are presented in Table 5.1. This table 
shows that Fe(ll!) and many other multivalent ions behave similarly to 
the aquoaluminum(III) ion. 
The hydrolYSiS reactions depicted in Eqs. 5-9 to 5-12 are acid-base 
(proton transfer) reactions. Because of this. the pH of the solution will 
influence the distribution of the various species. In general. the percentage 
of the hydrolyzed species increases as the pH increases. just as the 
concentration of a conjugate base would increase if the pH of a solution 
containing its conjugate acid were raised. All trivalent and most divalent 
metal ions are complexed to some extent with OH-at the pH of natural 
waters. The alkaline earth metals hydrolyze Significantly only at high pH

(pH> 9 to 10). The pH of a solution to which metal ion is added can be 
calculated just as it was for acids in Chapter 4. The procedure is 
demonstrated by the following example. 
Example 5·2 
Calculate the pH of a 10-5 M Hg(CIO,), solution at 25'. Neglect ionic strength 
effects. 
Solution 
Because CI04-is a very poor complex former. perchloratomercury(1I) complexes 
can be neglected. The equilibrium of concern is 
(I) Hg2+ + 2H,O '" 2H+ Hg(OH),'; log K ~ -6.3 
The species HgOH+ can also form in solution by the following reaction 
log K ~ -3.7 
but the Hg(OH)2° complex generally predominates; to simplify this example, we 
neglected HgOH+. If this species had not been neglected, our approach would 
have been similar to that used to determine the pH of a diprotic acid solution.

There are five unknowns. [H+]. [OH-]. [Hg'+]. [Hg(OH),'] and [CIO,-]. and we 
have stated five equations. We will combine these equations to arrive at one 
equation in (H+], which we will solve by trial and error. 
First let us set 
[Hg(OH),']

Combining Eqs. (I) and (2) yields 
10-6,3

Then. combining Eqs. (2). (3). and (4) to eliminate [C10,-]. we obtain 
(7) [H+] ~ 2[Hg(OH),'] + [OH-] 
and substituting for [Hg(OH),'] from Eq. (6). and for [OH-] from Eq. (5).

Solving Eqs. (6) and (8) by trial and error yields a solution pH of 4.7. 
The pH found in Example 5·2 is quite low, showing that the mercuric 
ion has the property of a weak acid of approximately the same strength 
as acetic acid. The acid strength of some metal ions is quite considerable. 
For example, the pH of equimolar H,PO. and Fe3+ solutions are similar. 
The strong acid properties of hydrated metal ions become evident in 
processes such as coagulation/flocculation, where hydrated aluminum 
sulfate (alum) or ferric chloride is added to a natural water that is buffered 
with bicarbonate. The metal ion "titrates" (or reacts with) a stoichiometric 
amount of alkalinity, just as the addition of an equal amount of strong 
mineral acid would. 
Example 5·3 
A raw water with a pH of 8.0 and a total alkalinity of 80 mg/liter as CaCO, 
requires a dose of 25 mglliter aluminum sulfate (AI2(S04)3 . 14H20) for effective 
coagulation/flocculation. What is the dose of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in mg/ 
liter required to maintain the alkalinity of the water at 80 mg/liter as CaC03 
during coagulation/flocculation? Make the simplifying assumption that the only 
hydroxoaluminum(III) species to form is Al{OH)3{s); this assumption is valid at 
many surface water treatment plants. 
Solution 
We can treat this problem as a stoichiometric acid/base reaction. Since the 
alkalinity for the reaction will come entirely from the NaOH to be added. we use 
it as the base in the reaction. 
Al,(SO,), . 14H,0 + 6NaOH "" 2Al(OH)"" + 6Na+ + 3S0,'­
The molecular weight of alum is 594 and that of NaOH is 40. Thus

We assumed in Example 5·3 that when alum was added to water, there 
was a stoichiometric reaction with the hydroxide to form aluminum 
hydroxide. Although this assumption is good enough for estimating the 
amount of natural alkalinity that reacts, or the amount of hydroxide that 
must be added to restore that which reacted with the alum, it does not Hydrolysis of Metal Ions-H20 and OH-as Ligands 213 
accurcitely represent the detailed equilibrium picture. As we have seen 
. already, a variety of mononuclear hydroxoaluminum(III) complexes form. 
Aqueous solutions of aluminum ions at neutral pH values have also been 
reported to contain polynuclear hydroxoaluminum(III) complexes,' such 
as AI2(OH)24+, AI,(OH),,4+ and AI,.{OH)3:+' It is thought that such species 
are formed by the condensation of mononuclear hydrolysis products (see 
Section 5-2). 
Although the above species have been proposed as stable species, 
other polynuclear hydroxoaluminum(III) complexes are thought to exist 
as short~lived intermediates between the hydrated aluminum ion and 
aluminum hydroxide precipitate (AI(OH)",) in supersaturated solution. 9 
We shall indeed see (Chapter 6) that when we consider the presence of 
the stable polynuclear aluminum hydrolysis species in the representation 
of heterogeneous equilibria, the stability region of the aluminum hydrox­
ide solid is more confined than when their presence is disregarded. The 
polynuclear complexes generally have higher OH-and less H20 content 
per mole of aluminum than the mononuclear hydroxoaluminum com­
plexes. Some workers suggest that the higher OH-content of these 
species makes "hydrolyzed aluminum ion" a more effective coagulant in 
water treatment than the mononuclear hydrolysis species. to They argue 
that the polynuclear species act as short-chain polymers that adsorb to 
specific sites on particles, thereby destabilizing them so aggregation can 
take place. Although adsorption can take place even if the polymer and 
particle are of the same charge, destabilization appears more efficient if 
they have opposite charges. The classical "residual turbidity" versus 
"alum dose" plot, Fig. 5-1, illustrates how alum functions as a coagulant 
for a water of moderate alkalinity. At low alum doses there is no reduction 
in turbidity. At these low doses there is insufficient hydroxoaluminum(III) 
species to provide effective destabilization. The further addition of alum 
to the point at which complete destabilization occurs causes a reduction 
in turbidity to a minimum value. The further increase in alum dose will 
result in restabilization of the particles because of a near complete 
coverage of the particle with aluminum hydrolysis product. The further 
addition of alum to very high doses results in the formation of a precipitate 
of AI(OH)"" because the solubility product of Al(OH)"" is exceeded (see 
Chapter 6). This bulky precipitate enmeshes particles in it and settles 
rapidly to form the so-called "sweep floc" region of coagulation-floccu­
lation. At most water treatment plants, coagulation/flocculation takes 
place in the "sweep floc" range because it is very difficult to vary the

Trivalent iron, Fe(I1I), which like aluminum(III) is used in water and 
wastewater treatment as a coagulating agent, as well as other multivalent 
metal cations (e.g .. lead), form polynuclear hydroxocomplexes. These 
complexes tend to predominate at high metal concentrations and inter­
mediate to high pH values. For example, Fig. 5-2 is a distribution diagram

Similar distribution diagrams for concentrations of total iron{III) of

diagrams are based on equilibrium constants of mononuclear hydroxo 
complexes (see Table 5-0. The equilibrium constant for the dimeric 
Fe,{OH),'+ is 2Fe'+ + 2H,O "" Fe,{OH),4+ + 2H+; log K = -2.91. Like lead, 
the fraction of the total iron{III) present as hydroxo complexes, including 
the dimeric Fe,{OH),'+, increases as the pH increases. Also illustrated in 
Fig. 5-3 is the effect of total iron{I1I) concentration on the predominance 
of polymeric hydroxocomplexes of Fe{I1I). At pH 2, for example, virtually 
no Fe,{OH),4+ is present in the 10-' M CT.F,om solution whereas a significant 
amount exists in the 10-' M CT,F,(I!D solution. 
The previously discussed interaction of hydroxoaluminum{III) polymers 
with particle surfaces is but one example of the ways in which the types 
of species of metals, especially the complexes, influence the distribution 
of metals in the natural water environment. The bulk of the total metal 
content of natural waters and wastewaters is usually associated with 
particulates either as precipitates (solids) or adsorbed on particle surfaces, 
such as clays or organic detritus. In general, hydroxo, carbonato, and

sulfato complexes of metals tend to sorb more strongly at clay surfaces 
than do the free metal ions. For example, James and Healy" have shown 
that the adsorption of cobalt on silica surfaces is a function of the ionic 
state of the cobalt (see Table 5-2 and Fig. 5-4). At pH values below 6, 
where the cobalt is present entirely as Co", there is very little adsorption.

As the pH increases to between 6 to 8.5, the removal of cobalt from 
solution by adsorption on the silica particle's increases dramatically. In 
the pH range from 6 to 8.5 the free Co'+, ion decreases from 100 percent 
of the total cobalt to zero, and the predominant cobalt species become the 
adsorbable hydroxocobalt(IIl complexes, CoOH+ and Co(OHl,'. 
5.6. COMPLEXES WITH OTHER INORGANIC LIGANDS 
Natural waters contain significant concentrations of inorganic and 
organic iigands in addition to H,O and OH-. In this section we will look 
at some examples of the effects of inorganic ligands on the speciation 
and properties of metals in natural waters. The next section of this chapter 
will deal with organic ligands. 
Reference to Table 1-5 shows that the predominant metal cations in 
typical fresh and ocean waters are Na+, CaH, and MgH; the major ligands 
are HCO,-, CI-, and SO/-. At the typical natural water pH values of 
between 6.5 to 8.5, these metals are not strong complex formers in 
comparison with metals s!,ch as AI" and Fe'+. 
For complicated systems such as natural waters it is necessary to use 
a computer to determine the degree of complexation of the various cations 
with the ligands available. To illustrate this technique, we determine the 
degree of complexation of the various cations present in the ocean and 
in average river water.13

The results show that only in ocean water are any of the metals in this 
model complexed to any significant extent by the inorganic ligands 
examined. In addition only sulfate is a significant complexing agent and 
only calcium and magnesium complexes are important. This type of 
calculation gives us confidence in ignoring the complexes of CaH, MgH, 
Na+, and K+ with OH-, HC03-, CI-, SO/-, and COj-, when dealing with 
fresh waters of neutral pH values. Increasing the pH value or ligand 
concentration, especially sulfate, may require that complexes of these 
metals be taken into consideration. 
Several analytical methods will differentiate the "free" (hydrated) metal 
ions from dissolved complexed metal ions. These methods include specific 
ion electrodes, polarographic, and other amperometric and voltammetric 
methods and various types of spectroscopy (see Section 7-10). Specific ion 
electrodes only respond to the free metal ion for which they are "specific." 
To determine the relative amounts of complexed and uncomplexed metal 
ion in a solution, we can use a "wet chemical" method to measure the 
total concentration of "free + complexed" ions, and then an ion-specific 
electrode to determine the free metal ion concentration (activity). Care 
must be taken to eliminate interferences that may affect these measure­
ments. We deduce the concentration of the "complexed ions" by the 
difference between these two measurements. For example, in the EDTA 
titration method for hardness,14 free and complexed calcium and mag­
nesium ion's are measured. 
Methods such as anodic stripping voltammetry, polarography, and 
spectroscopy not only can differentiate between "free" and "complexed" 
metal ion species but in some instances can be used to identify the nature 
and determine the concentrations of individual complex species. 
Inorganic ligands that complex metal ions can alter the effects that 
metal ions exert in natural waters. For example, the literature on fish 
toxicity contains references to the effects of water hardness on the toxicity 
of heavy metals. The general observation made is that heavy metals are 
much less toxic to fish in hard water than they are in soft water. We can 
provide an explanation of this result in terms of complex formation 
between the heavy metal copper; and the alkalinity ions (HC0 3 -and 
COj-), since the alkalinity usually increases together with the water 
hardness. 
The distribution of copper species in a natural water buffered by the 
carbonate system is presented in Fig. 5-5. The diagram is based on the 
presence of the copper precipitate jenorite, CuO",. If the solution were 
not in equilibrium with this solid, the species distribution would not be 
quite the same; however, radical changes would not occur. Therefore, the 
diagram can be used to determine regions where certain species are 
important. From Fig. 5-5 it can be seen that only at below pH 6.5 is free

copper ion, Cu2+, the predominant copper-containing species. At higher 
pH values the carbonatocopper(II) complex, CuCO,', and the hydroxo­
copper(II) complexes, Cu(OH),- and Cu(OH).'-, are the major copper­
containing species. The diagram predicts that in the pH range 6.5 to 9.5 
(a range that covers the pH span of most natural waters) the major copper­
containing species is CuCO,'. Making the assumption that the complex 
formation reaction 
10gK = -6.8 
controls the concentration of Cu'+ in this pH range, the Cu'+ concentration 
at various alkalinities can be calculated for a variety of pH values (rable 
5-7). 
It is apparent that alkalinity has a profound effect on the free copper 
ion concentration. For example, at pH 7 increasing the alkalinity from 50 
to 250 mg/liter as CaCO, decreases the Cu2+ ion level from 25 to 9 percent 
of the total copper present. Returning to our original observation that / 222 Coordination Chemistry

copper is more toxic to fish in soft water than in hard water, we should 
note that high hardness is usually accompanied by high alkalinity. 
Therefore, in hard water a greater fraction of the total copper is complexed 
than in soft water. If we assume that the only copper species toxic to fish 
is the Cu'+ ion, then increasing the fraction of the carbonatocopper(II) 
complex by increasing the carbonate concentration will decrease the 
toxicity. 
Complex formation influences the concentration of ligands (and their 
effects) as well as metal ions. An important example of this relates to the 
toxicity of "cyanide" to fish. Most toxicity researchers agree that the toxic 
component of a "cyanide" solution is undissociated hydrocyanic acid, 
HCN. When a complex.forming metal ion is added to a cyanide solution, 
the equilibrium between HCN and CN-will be displaced in the direction 
of CN-because the metal ion will remove free CN-from solution, 
incorporating it into a cyano metal complex. It is not uncommon to 
encounter waste discharges contai;'ing both heavy metals and cyanide, 
since metal cyanide solutions are used in a variety of metal finishing 
processes. Most heavy metals form cyano complexes. For example, the 
following equilibria are applicable to the addition of nickel to a cyanide 
solution, 
HCN;;= W + CN-; K, = 6.17 X 10-10 
(34 = 10" 
There is no evidence for the existence of the mono·, di., and 
tricyanonickel(II) complexes; therefore, we need only consider the 
Ni(CN),'- complex. Figure 5·6 shows the profound effect that this complex 
has on the HCN concentration. 
At pH 7.5, for example, the solution containing nickel has an HCN level 
of about 3 x 10-6 M (-0.08 mglliter) while in the cyanide solution 
containing no nickel the HCN level is 4 X 10-5 (-1.1 mglliter); that is, all 
of the cyanide present is HCN. Knowing that the component toxic to fish -5 3 x 10 Complexes with Organic Ligands 223

is HCN, we can guess that the addition of Ni'+ to a cyanide solution 
would have a dramatic effect on its toxicity. Doudoroff et al.15 have 
provided a striking illustration of this effect using the toxicity to fish of 
solutions of nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, and silver cyanide complexes. 
When the median resistanc<;! (or immobilization) time of the fish is plotted 
against the total cyanide concentration of these solutions (log/log plot), 
no sensible relationship could be obtained. However, when the same plot 
was made against the concentration of molecular HCN in the complex 
cyanide solutions there was a linear relationship between HCN concen­
tration and median resistance time (see Fig. 5-7). 
5.7. COMPLEXES WITH ORGANIC LIGANDS 
Complex formation involving organic ligands is important in two 
general areas of water chemistry. First, in the analysis of various 
constituents of water, organic compounds are used as complexing agents. 
For example, EDTA is used to determine water hardness by forming

Second, a wide variety of organic compounds in natural waters and 
wastewater can act as complexing agents for metal ions. The nature and 
extent of metal ion complexation by natural water organics is not well­
defined, probably because of the poorly defined nature of these organic 
compounds and also because of the staggering complexity of these Complexes with Organic Ligands 225 
multimetal. multiligand systems. Several examples will be given here to 
illustrate the importance of complexation by various organic compounds 
in determining free metal ion concentration in natural waters and 
wastewaters and to illustrate the complexity of the systems. 
5.7.1. The Nature of Copper in Water and Wastewater 
Copper forms complexes with numerous ligands. both inorganic and 
organic that are present in water and wastewater. Table 5-8 gives some 
examples of the types of soluble complexes detected by Stiff" in natural 
and treated waters and sewage. Beside complexes with inorganic ligands 
(Le.. carbonate and cyanide). the river waters contained significant 
amounts of copper complexed by organic ligands, that is, in the categories 
of "amino acid complex" and "inert humic complex." Amino acid com­
plexes of copper are formed according to the following general equation:'

For the amino acids leucine, valine, alanine, serine, glutamic acid, 
aspartic acid. and tyrosine. the values of log 13, range from 7 to -9; values 
of log 13, are in the approximate range of 14 to 16. The amino acid cysteine. 
which contains the -SH group forms an extremely strong complex with 
cuprous ion (Cu+) with a log 13, value of 19.5. 
As we will see later. "humic acids" are an extremely complex group of 
compounds. Because of this no one compound can act as a true model for 
this group. However. phenolic and carboxylic acid groups are common 
functional groups in humic acids. The substance 3.4.dihydroxybenzoic 
acid serves to illustrate one type of complexing group that may bind 
metals such as copper to humic acids: 
¢:OH 
o + 
OH

3,4 dihydroxybenzoic acid + 2H+; log /3, = 12.8 
From the values of the stability constants of these organic complexes of 
copper, it is evident that they must play a significant role in the 
complexation of copper in natural waters. Indeed. il is significant to note 
that in none of the waters listed in Table 5·8, is Cu'+ -the uncomplexed 
cupric ion---a major copper-containing species. The picture becomes even 
more complex when the distribution of copper between solution and 
particulate phases is considered. Beside the copper·containing precipi. 
tates (e.g .. tenorile. CuO",) we must also realize that the types of organic 
and inorganic ligand groups which complex with copper in solution also 
can exist on the surfaces of particulate solids such as organic detrital 
material; there they serve to bind the copper to a solid particle and 
transfer it from the "soluble copper" category to the "particulate copper" 
category. Stiff17 analyzed some polluted river waters in England and 
found that between 43 to 88 percent (average 69 percent) of the total copper 
present was in the particulate phase. 
5.7.2. Complexation by NTA 
Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) is a triprotic acid with the struclure: 
/CH,COOH 
COOHCH,-N, 
CH,COOH 
nitrilotriacetic acid, NTA

Its sodium salt. N(CH,COONa),. can be used as a component of commercial 
laundry detergents. In these products the NTA is a so-called "builder." Its 
function is to complex the components of water hardness (Ca2+ + Mg2+) 
and prevent them from reacting with the detergent molecule itself. thereby 
reducing the effectiveness of the detergent. This type of deliberate 
complexation is often called "sequestration." and compounds such as 
NTA are known as "sequestering agents." Commercial laundry detergents 
containing NTA were developed because some regions of the United 
States and Canada prohibited the use of detergents containing the usual 
sequestering agents for Ca2+ and Mg2+ -the polyphosphates-because of 
their suspected contribution to causing accelerated eutrophication of 
surface waters. 
The introduction of NTA caused concern in some segments of the 
scientific community on several counts. It was thought that NTA introduced 
into detergents would find its way into domestic sewage. Being a strong 
complexing agent. it will keep toxic heavy metals in solution. thereby 
preventing their precipitation as hydroxides. carbonates. phosphates. 
sulfides. and so forth. and their subsequent removal by incorporation 
into wastewater-derived ·sludges. If the NTA itself and the NTA heavy 
metal complexes are not readily biodegradable. they will pass through 
the wastewater treatment processes, carrying into the receiving waters 
both their complexing ability and any heavy metals complexed by them. 
Once in the receiving water. free NTA will have the ability to transport 
heavy metals from sediments into solution by complexing them. In the 
course of time the NTA heavy metal complexes will be biodegraded. 
releasing the complexed heavy metal that will cause toxicity in the 
receiving water. 
Some aspects of these concerns. such as the question of biodegradability 
of NTA and its heavy metal complexes. are beyond the scope of this text. 
However. NTA appears to be biodegradable in secondary. biological. 
waste treatment processes. The concerns dealing with complexation will 
be examined here. 
Because NTA forms many metal complexes with a wide range of 
stabilities. it is important to examine a model or conduct experiments on 
systems where the concentrations of the metals and the amount of NTA 
available for complexing closely resemble that found in the natural water 
system of interest. In addition. the presence of other ligands. both 
inorganic and organic. should be considered. Because pH influences the 
speciation of NTA and the concentrations of other ligands such as CO,'-. 
OH-. and so forth. the pH of the system under study should be carefully 
controlled in experimental and model systems. 
Equilibrium models that consider many metals and many ligands are 
constructed using the same set of equations used for simple acid-base 
and complexation calculations. First. total concentrations of all compo­
nents are stated; then all possible species are identified; and mass 
balances. a charge balance. and equilibrium equations are written. It is. 228 Coordination Chemistry 
however, tedious and virtually impossible to solve these equations 
manually so that a computer solution is needed. The reader is referred 
to published articles for descriptions of computer programs suitable for 
the solution of multimetal, multiligand systems." Here we will examine 
the results of such a solution. Consider the system shown in Table 5-9 
which represents the composition of a lake water at pH 8. The model does 
not consider the presence of organic ligands other than NTA. However, 
it is estimated that the stability constants of NTA metal complexes are 
significantly greater than other organic-matter metal complexes. Because 
of this the result should approximate what might be found in a water 
containing a low organic-matter concentration. The acid base equilibria 
of NTA, carbonic acid, and phosphoric acid and the complex formation 
of all metals with OH-, HCO,-, CO?-, PO,'-, SO.'-, and CI-as well as 
with NT A'-were considered. The results of the calculations will be 
discussed here; for details of the equations used see Childs." The results 
of the computations are presented in Table 5-10, which shows that at pH 
8, NTA, just like any other complexing agent, complexes metals in order 
of the values of the stability constants of the NTA metal complex. At an 
NTA concentration of 10-7 M, there is only sufficient NTA to result in minor 
complexation of only the metals with the largest NTA metal complex 
stability constants. Thus 4 percent of the total Cu(lI) (log K = 13, where 
K is for the reaction Cu'+ + NTA'- -,> CuNTA-), 2 percent of the total Pb(II)

(log K = 11.8), and I percent of the total Ni(II) (log K = 11.3) as well as 
fractional percentages of Fe (III) (log K = 10.9) and Zn(II) (log K = 10.4) are 
complexed with NTA. 
As the NTA supply increases to 3 X 10-' M, significant complexing of 
the above metals takes place; for example Cu(Il), 82 percent; Pb(II). 80 
percent; Ni(II), 60 percent; Fe(III), 34 percent; and Zn(II), 20 percent. Again, 
since the NTA is not present in a quantity in excess of the combined 
concentration of all the heavy metals, there is incomplete complexing of 
each of them. Moreover, the completeness of complexation is in strict 
order of values of the stability constants of the heavy metal NTA 
complexes. At a total NT A level of 2 x 10-4 all of the heavy metals are 
completely complexed oy NTA. In addition, some of the major cations, 
Ca(ll) and Mg(II), which form weaker NTA complexes than the heavy 
metals, are bound to NTA at levels of 17 and 2 percent, respectively. 
It is interesting to note that although the log (11K,,,) value for NTA is 
10.3, (an equilibrium constant value that is comparable to the log K of the 
Zn-NTA complex (10.4», only 9 percent of the H+ is bound to NTA at total 
NTA levels of 2 x 10-4 M, while the Zn(Il) is completely complexed by 
NTA. The difference in degree of complexation lies in the relative 
concentrations of Zn(II) and H+. CT•znM is two orders of magnitude greater 
than [H+] at pH 8, that is, 1.5 x 10-' M versus 10-8 M. Comparison of the 
equilibria 230 Coordination Chemistry

That is, higher concentrations of metal ions as well as large complex 
formation constant values tend to favor the formation of NTA-metal 
complexes. 
If we examine the other side of the coin, we can see the way in which 
the concentration of NTA and the relative values of the stability constanls 
of metal ion-NTA complexes determine the distribution of added NTA 
between the various metal ion NTA complexes. Figure 5-8 shows that at 
very low levels of added NTA the NTA is primarily present as the CuNTA­
complex with minor amounts present as PbNTA-and CaNTA- complexes 
in descending order of importance. As the quantity of added NTA increases 
to levels such as those typically encountered (Le., -10-6 M) in waters 
receiving secondary sewage effluent from communities using NTA based 
detergents, the Fe(OH),NTA'-, Fe(OH)NTA-, and ZnNTA- complexes start 
to be more important but, although decreasing in percentage, the CuNTA 
complex is still by far the most significant repository of added NTA. At 
added NTA levels of 10-4 M, CaNTA accounts for close to 85 percent of the 
NT A in solution, HNT A'-for close to 8 percent, and MgNTA -for about 2 
percent. The heavy metal complexes of NTA account cumulatively for 
less than 5 percent of the added NTA. It should be kept in mind, however, 
that while these heavy metal NTA complexes only account for a minor 
fraction of the added NTA, the heavy metals are completely complexed 
by NTA. 
Table 5-10 and Fig. 5-8 emphasize the importance of conducting model 
studies and experiments on complex multi-metal, multi-ligand systems 
at concentrations of metals and ligands that closely resemble the envi­
ronment being studied. .. , Complexes with Organic Ligands 231

The influence of NTA as a complexing agent on the distribution of metal 
species can be assessed by comparing the concentrations of various 
metal species both in the presence and absence of NTA. 
Table 5-11 shows the calculated distribution of some selected metals 
in a water in the absence of NTA. but otherwise of the same composition 
as that used to compute the distribution of NTA complexes given in Table 
5-10. NTA at 3 X 10-6 M effectively draws the metals that are complexed 
by the inorganic ligands present from these complexes into NTA com­
plexes. The metals that are poorly complexed by inorganic ligands are 
not significantly affected by the addition of this amount of NTA.

whose structure is not well-defined. They are a mixture of poorly biode­
gradable decomposition products and by-products of natural organic 
matter produced by both plants and animals. Humic substances have 
poorly defined physical and chemical characteristics (e.g .• melting point. 
refractive index. and molecular weight) and have been characterized by 
Schnitzer and Khan" as "amorphous. brown or black. hydrophilic. acidic, 
polydisperse substances of molecular weights ranging from several 
hundreds to tens of thousands." Humic substances account for the bulk 
of the organic material in natural waters and soils. In dilute aqueous 
solution their "brown or black" color becomes the "yellow-brown" typical 
of natural water color and of the color of biologically treated sewage 
effluents. 
Humic substances have been arbitrarily divided into three diverse 
groups of compounds on the basis of their solubility in dilute acid and 
dilute base. Fulvic acids are soluble in both dilute acid (pH I) and dilute 
base. Humic acids are soluble in dilute base but are precipitated by dilute 
acid (pH I). Humin is insoluble in both dilute acid and dilute base. Some 
authorities divide humic substances into only two groups: the humic 
acids and the fulvic acids. stating that the humins have the same 
characteristics as humic acids but that their solubility in base is hindered 
because they are associated with clay minerals in natural waters.21 The 
gross chemical and physical properties of humic acids and fulvic acids 
are presented in Table 5-12. It is the fulvic acid fraction that appears to

be the" predominant group of humic substances in natural waters. Fulvic 
" acids appear to have lower molecular weights than humic acids; they 
contain a higher percentage of oxygen and the oxygen appears to be 
located in a greater percentage of carboxyl groups. 
Although the chemical structure of both the humic acid and fulvic acid 
fractions of the humic substances is not precisely known, the nature of 
the major functional groups present is fairly well defined. The following

Schnitzer" has proposed that the structure in Fig, 5-9 represents a 
significant portion of the fulvic acid group. The various aromatic ring 
structures are bonded together by hydrogen bonds between the functional 
groups on adjacent rings, 
This structure does not account for the nitrogen and sulfur content of 
humic substances. It has been suggested that these elements are derived 
from parts of other types of molecule, for example, proteins, which are 
associated with the humic substances. Indeed it has been proposed" that 
humic substances consist of an -aromatic core to which pep tides, carbo­
hydrates, metals, and phenolic acids are chemically or physically at­
tached. It can be seen that the structure in Fig. 5-9 is an "open" network, 
In fact, there have been suggestions that organic and inorganic materials 
associated with humic substances are trapped inside these "holes" in the 
humic substance structure.24

involved with determining the nature of the .association between humic 
substances and metals. It is difficult to define the nature of the product 
of a chemical reaction when the nature of the reactants is not known. We 
are faced with this situation here, since the exact chemical structure of 
humic substances is not well defined and this structure can change from 
one water to another. For example, Christman" has found that several 
waters each with the same color intensity (measured as 100 cobalt· 
platinum units)26 contained dissolved organic carbon concentrations of 
anywhere from 10 to 30 mg Clliter. 
Humic substances undoubtedly have the ability to combine with (or 
bind) considerable quantities of metal ions. For example, many metals 
can be enriched into peat (which is a type of soil organic matter of a 
humic nature) from soil waters so that the concentration of the metal in 
the peat is up to 10,000 times that of its concentration in the water. It has 
also been observed that in many natural waters, Fe(II1) is associated with 
the color causing organics. Schnitzer" has estimated that a solution 
containing 100 mg of fulvic acid/liter can maintain in solution 8.4 mg 
Fe(II1) and 4.0 mg AI(II1)/lite.r. The concentration of Fe(II1) is more than two 
orders of magnitude greater than that expected in solution in a water at 
-pH 7 in equilibrium with ferric hydroxide. 
For this reason there is no question about the ability of humic materials 
to combine with metals; it is the nature of the association that is open to 
question. Two modes of binding appear to be significant. These are (I) 
the formation of complexes or chelates between the functional groups of 
the humic substance and the metal, and (2) an association between the 
humic substances and a colloidal particle of metal hydroxide (possibly 
through sorption on the surface of the particle) whereby the colloidal 
particles are peptized, that is, stabilized, in suspension and prevented 
from coagulating or settling. The formation of one or another of these 
associations between humic material and metals may depend on the 
initial states of humic matter and metal and their absolute and relative 
concentrations. High concentrations of metal (exceeding the solubility 
limits of the metal hydroxide) and high metal to humic substance ratios 
would seem to favor the formation of peptized particles over soluble 
complexes. Indeed Schnitzer" proposes that the transport and deposition 
of metals such as Fe(II1) in soils is regulated by humic substance·iron 
compounds of various solubilities. Schnitzer suggests that humic sub·

stances dissolve Fe(lII) from iron·containing solids in the soil to form 
Fe(III).humic substance complexes. At the surface of the soil these 
complexes contain a mole ratio" of Fe(III):humic substance of I: I. As the 
soil water percolates down through the soil, the Fe(III).humic substance 
gradually becomes more and more enriched with Fe(lII) (mole ratios of up 
to 6: 1 have been found) and concomitantly more and more insoluble. At 
very high Fe(III)-humic substance mole ratios, the complexes precipitate 
out to form iron·rich layers in the soil horizon. The high concentrations 
of metals such as iron, copper, and uranium in highly organic soils and 
deposits (such as peat and coal) are thought to arise also from the 
association of metals with natural organics in these materials. 
The nature of the complexes formed between humic substances and 
metals are not known unequivocally. By blocking various functional 
groups on the humic substances and then exposing the modified humic 
material to metals in solution, it is possible to obtain an idea of which 
functional groups are important in the complexation of metals. Schnitzer 
and Khan'· report that at pH 3.5, 75 percent of the complexed Fe(III), 66 
percent of the Al(III), and 50 percent of the Cu(II) reacted simultaneously 
with strongly acidic carboxyl groups and with phenolic groups. A further 
8 percent of the Fe(III), 20 percent of the Al(IIl), and 32 percent of the Cu(II) 
reacted with the more weakly acidic carboxyl groups alone. From these 
results we can account for in excess of 80 percent of the complexed Fe(III), 
Al(III), and Cu(I1) by complexes such as 
+ Cu (lJ) <= 
or 
The experiments also indicated that the alcoholic OH groups were not 
involved in forming metal complexes.

of fulvic acid. For the fulvic acid studied by Schnitzer the average molecular 
weight was 670.

Although it is impossible to write an exact complexation reaction for 
metal ions and humic substances, it is possible to derive stability 
constants on an operational basis, that is, for individual preparations of 
humic acids and fulvic acids from specific sources. The formation constant 
values in Table 5-13 were obtained by Schnitzer and Hansen" for a 
particular fulvic acid. 
A comparison of the formation constants for metal-fulvic acid complexes 
shown in Table 5-13 with those values for the complexes of the same 
metals with NTA (Table 5-10) would seem to indicate that the metal-fulvic 
acid complexes are much weaker than the metal-NTA complexes. Indeed 
some of the values of the constants for metal-fulvic acid complexes 
approach the values for the very weak inorganic ion pairs (e.g., MgCO,O, 
log K = 2.9; CaSO,", log K = 3.4). Morgan" has pointed out that the values 
for the metal-fulvic acid complexes were measured at much lower pH 
values than the K values for other complexing agents such as NTA and 
EDTA. The stability constants for NTA complexes reported in Table 5-10 
are for th; totally deprotonated species,

measured at high pH. The same is true for the humic substance-metal ion 
complex equilibrium constants measured at low pH values. Morgan33 
estimates that at pH 2 to 3 the -COO- groups, which are important in 
forming fulvic acid-metal ion complexes, are virtually all in the -COOH 
or protonated form. Thus to obtain the value of the formation constant at 
intermediate pH for metal ion fulvic acid complexes, when the carboxyl 
groups are ionized, we should divide the equilibrium constant values 
presented in Table 5-13 by the dissociation constant of the -COOH group,

humic materials.

influence the biological productivity or the amount of organisms such as 
algae and higher plants and animals that a natural water can support. 
For example, let us suppose that the growth-limiting nutrient for algae 
in a lake is iron, Fe{III). Let us assume that there are no humic substances 
in the lake water and that the Fe{III) concentration is controlled by its 
equilibrium with ferric hydroxide, Fe{OH)"". We shall see from calcula­
tions made in Chapter 6 that at pH 8, the maximum possible Fe(I1I) 
concentration is 10-11 M, or 6 X 10-4 mglliter. We also will learn in Chapter 
6 that some precipitates like Fe{OH)"" are notoriously slow to reach 
equilibrium because they form slowly and dissolve slowly. Thus the 
water will contain only a minute amount of Fe{II1) and as the growth of 
algae consumes the Fe (III), the dissolution of Fe{OH)"" to replace the 
depleted Fe{III) may be quite slow. Therefore, we might expect very little 
and very slow growth of algae under these circumstances. 
Now consider the situation in the presence of humic substances that 
can complex Fe{I1I). The total amount of dissolved Fe{III) must be greater 
than in the absence of humic substances because, in addition to the Fe (III) 
in equilibrium with Fe(OH)"", we have in solution the Fe(IlI)-humic 
substance complexes. Let us also assume that the Fe{III)-humic substance 
complexes are labile-that is, they will dissociate rapidly to release 
Fe{III). In this situation we have not only seen an increase in the total 
dissolved iron but also an increase in the pool of readily available Fe{III). 
Observations made by Schnitzer" discussed previously have indicated 
34 M. Schnitzer, "Metal-Organic Matter Interactions in Soils and Waters," in 
Organic Compounds in the Environment, S. D. Faust and J. V. Hunter, eds., 
Dekker, 1971. 240 Coordination Chemistry 
that the increase in total dissolved iron in the presence of humic 
'substances can indeed be significant. In our example their presence 
would increase the amount and rate of algal growth; they might even 
increase the Fe(III) concentration to such a level that it would no longer 
be the nutrient in shortest supply that limits growth. 
In this hypothetical example the presence of the complexing ability of 
humic substances was seen to result in an increase in dissolved iron 
species. The presence of complexing agents in a water may not always 
have this effect. For example, if the complexing agent (I) forms a stable 
and or inert complex with the metal of interest, or (2) is present at a 
sufficiently high concentration, it may have the effect of reducing the 
level andlor availability of metal ions below that found in the absence of 
any complexing agent. In such a situation we would expect a decrease 
in the productivity of the water over that of a water in which there was 
no complexing agent. As an example of this type of effect, Siegel35 quotes 
unpublished work of Barber on the effect of several complexing agents 
on the productivity of water from the Gulf of Mexico. The complexing 
agents studied were DPTA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), EDTA, 
cysteine, and NTA. We can judge the relative "complexing ability" of 
these complexing agents by comparing the formation constant values of 
their complexes with Fe(III). These are DPTA; K = 1028,', EDTA, K = 10"; 
cysteine, K = 10" and NTA, K = 10'. At concentrations of 10-' M the four 
complexing agents stimulated the productivity of the water in the order 
expected, that is, the strongest complexing agent (DPTA) stimulated the 
productivity the most, and the weakest complexing agent (NTA) stimulated 
the productivity the least. When the concentration of the weakest com­
plexing agent was increased to 10-5 M, it stimulated productivity more 
than did cysteine. However, when the strongest complexing agent (DPTA) 
concentration was increased to 10-5 M, the productivity of the water was 
reduced below the level of the control containing no added complexing 
agents. Increasing the concentration of the next strongest complexing 
agent (EDTA) did not produce the same reduction in productivity. The 
productivity of the solutions was therefore in the following order: 
IO-'M EDTA 
10-5 M EDTA > 10-5 M NTA > 10-' M cysteine> 
10-' M DPTA 10-' M NTA > control> 10-5 M DPTA 
Apparently, DPTA is such a strong complexing agent that 10-5 M of it will 
reduce the metals level to a value below that required for as much growth 
as the control; increased levels of the weakest complexing agent, NT A, 
increase productivity while a tenfold difference in concentration of a

DISSOLUTION 
6.1. INTRODUCTION 
Precipitation and dissolution phenomena are extremely important in 
both natural waters and water treatment processes. Dissolution of min­
erals is a prime factor in determining the chemical composition of natural 
waters. Natural water chemical composition can be altered by precipi­
tption of minerals and the subsequent sedimentation of these solids from 
supersaturated solutions. Water and wastewater treatment processes 
such as lime-soda softening. iron removal. coagulation with hydrolyzing 
metal salts. and phosphate precipitation are based on precipitation 
phenomena. 
Both equilibrium considerations and the rates of reactions are important. 
Knowledge of equilibrium relationships permits the calculation of con­
centrations at equilibrium and thus the amount of precipitate or amount 
of the material that dissolves can be calculated. In many instances rate 
controls the extent of reaction because insufficient time is available for 
equilibrium to be achieved. 
We must be aware that equilibrium calculations and log-concentration 
diagrams of systems involving heterogeneous equilibria may only provide 
us with the boundary conditions of the system rather than the situation 
that truly exists. Thus equilibrium calculations involving solids in waters 
and wastewaters are generally less representative of the true situation 
than acid-base equilibrium calculations for the following reasons. 
I. Some heterogeneous equilibria are slowly established. 
2. The thermodynamically predicted stable solid phase for a given set 
of conditions may not indeed be the phase that is formed. 
3. Solubility depends both on the degree of crystallinity and the 
particle size of the solids (which may vary from case to case). 
4. Supersaturation may exist; that is, solution concentrations in excess 
of those predicted by equilibrium calculations may prevail. 
5. The ions produced by the dissolution of solids may undergo further 
reaction in solution. 
6. There is a wide variation in the reported values of heterogeneous 
equilibrium constants. 244 Precipitation and Dissolution 
Because of the last reason it is imperative that one be sure of the 
conditions under which equilibrium constants were measured prior to 
using a particular value. 
In this chapter we will deal with the kinetics and equilibrium calcu­
lations of heterogeneous systems. Graphical and computational methods 
for solving equilibrium problems will be presented. The precipitation of 
calcium carbonate will be discussed in some detail, and the chemistry 
of phosphorus will be used as a detailed example of several heterogeneous 
equilibria that are of relevance to natural waters and treatment processes. 
6,2, PRECIPITATION AND DISSOLUTION KINETICS 
Precipitation has generally been observed to occur in three steps: (1) 
nucleation, (2) crystal growth, and (3) agglomeration and the ripening of 
the solids.' It is possible for a solution that is only slightly supersaturated 
with respect to a solid phase to be stable indefinitely. When the degree 
of supersaturation is increased or when fine particles of a substance are 
mixed with this solution, precipitation occurs. 
For example, Trussell' reports a simple experiment in which three 
solutions containing Ca'+ and carbonate species were titrated with NaOH. 
The turbidity of the solution was monitored after various increments of 
NaOH addition to detect the formation of a CaCO",) precipitate. Figure 
6·1 shows that it was not until the value of the equilibrium constant for 
the precipitation of CaCO",) had been exceeded by 40 to 50 times that 
evidence of precipitate formation was shown. 
6.2,1. Nucleation 
A nucleus is a fine particle on which the spontaneous formation or 
precipitation of a solid phase can take place. Nuclei can be formed from 
clusters of a few molecules or ion pairs of component ions of the 
precipitate, or they may be fine particles unrelated chemically to the 
precipitate but with some similarity of crystal lattice structure. Precipi­
tation from homogeneous solution (Le., a solution with no solid phase 
present) requires that nuclei be formed from ions in solution. If the nuclei 
are formed from the component ions of the precipitate, the initial phase 
of precipitation is referred to as homogeneous nucleation; if the foreign 
particles are the nuclei, the nucleation is said to be heterogeneous. 
Because virtually all aqueous solutions contain fine particles of various 
types, most nucleation is heterogeneous.

The formation of nuclei from precipitate ions is an energy-consuming 
process because one creates an organized structure with defined surfaces 
from a random arrangement of solution constituents. Because of this 
energy requirement it is necessary for solutions to be supersaturated, or 
have concentrations greater than that predicted by equilibrium with the 
precipitate. before the precipitate will form from a homogeneous solution. 
This driving force. or necessary degree of supersaturation. tends to be 
larger for homogeneous nucleation than for heterogeneous nucleation 
because the precipitate ions can collect on the surface of the foreign 
particle. and because the free energy to form a crystallite on a similar 
surface is less. In essence the foreign surface serves the same function 
as the surface of the precipitate particles; the only requirement is that the 
foreign surface be somewhat similar to the precipitate in lattice structure 
and distance between adjacent ions.' 
6.2.2. Crystal Growth 
Crystals form by the deposition of the precipitate constituent ions onto 
nuclei. Since water and wastewater treatment processes involving pre­
cipitation often do not reach equilibrium. the rate of crystal growth is of 
critical importance. Crystal growth rate can be expressed as

C = actual concentration of limiting ion, mole/liter 
k = rate constant, litem time-1 mg-1, mole(1-n)

For example, Nancollas and Reddy' found that the precipitation of calcium

where k = 5.76 liter' mg-t mole-1 min-to Of course, a different rate 
equation is expected for solutions with other properties. 
When the diffusion rate of ions to the surface of the crystal controls the 
crystal growth rate, the exponent n has a value of unity; when other 
processes such as the reaction rate at the crystal surface are rate limiting, 
the exponent may have a value other than unity. The value of k depends 
on solution conditions and the nature of the solid being precipitated. 
6.2.3. Agglomeration and Ripening 
The initial solid formed by precipitation may not be the most stable 
solid (the thermodynamically stable phase) for the reaction conditions. If 
this is the situation, then over a period of time the crystal structure of the 
precipitate may change to that of the stable phase. This change may be 
accompanied by additional precipitation and, consequently, a reduced 
solution concentration because the more stable phase usually has a lower 
solubility than the initially formed phase. The changes in crystal structure 
that take place over time are often called aging. A phenomenon called 
ripening may also take place whereby the crystal size of the precipitate 
increases. Since very small particles have a higher surface energy than 
larger particles, the solution concentration in equilibrium with small 
particles is higher than that in -equilibrium with larger particles. Con­
sequently, in a mixture of particle sizes, the large particles will continue 
to grow because the solution is still supersaturated with respect to them. 
As the concentration in the solution is lowered through the growth of the 
larger particles, the smaller particles dissolve because the solution 
concentration is now below their saturation value. Conversion of small 
particles into larger particles is also enhanced by the agglomeration of 
particles to form larger particles. 
This discussion should indicate that selection of an equilibrium constant 
for a precipitating solution is extremely difficult. Equilibrium constants 
4 G. H. Nancollas and M. M. Reddy, Chapter in Aqueous Environmental Chemistry 
of Metals, A. J. Rubin, ed" Ann Arbor·Science, 1975. Equilibrium Calculations 247 
reported for individual solids may vary widely because beside the effects 
of the particle size and aging, one must account for factors such as 
. complex formation, adsorption of impurities at the crystal interface, and 
formation of solid mixtures. 
6.2.4. Dissolution 
According to Walton,5 dissolution is nearly always controlled by the 
rate of diffusion of the species away from the solids. Accordingly, the 
rate law, 
de =kS (e' -e) 
dt (6·3) 
is followed. On occasion the rate of dissolution of the substance may be 
affected by the formation of surface complexes. 
6.3. EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS 
At the outset of any qiscussion on heterogeneous equilibria it is 
important to realize that heterogeneous equilibrium calculations only 
apply when there is an excess of the solid of interest present. If solid is 
absent, the equilibrium calculations are not valid for predicting solution 
composition; they may only be used to test whether saturation with a 
particular solid exists. 
The situations commonly encountered are 
1. A solid phase or precipitate in a water containing no other constit· 
uents than those derived from the dissolution of the precipitate. The 
solutes produced by the dissolution of the precipitate do not react 
(form complexes, hydrolyze, etc.) in solution at moderate concen· 
trations and at an approximately neutral pH. Very few examples of 
this situation exist in water chemistry. Solids such as CaF",) and 
BaSO",) generally fit into this category under natural water condi· 
tions. 
2. Precipitates that dissolve to produce reactive solutes. The reaction 
may be hydrolysis (protolysis), or complex formation. Examples are 
CaC03(,) and AI(OH)3(') dissolving in water. 
3. Solids that dissolve in a solution containing a species that is the 
same as one of the species that results from dissolution of the 
precipitate. This situation results in the so·called common ion effect 
in which the presence of a common ion modifies the solubility of 
the solid. It may be further complicated by the production or 
presence of solutes that react further with solution constituents. 
5 A. G. Walton, The Formatlon and Properties of Precipitates, Wiley.lnterscience, 
New York, 1967. 248 Precipitation and Dissolution 
Examples are CaF2(s) dissolving in water containing ea2+ ion and 
CaCO"" dissolving in a solution containing CO,'-ion. 
4. More complex systems where a variety of processes such as gas 
transfer and redox reactions are superimposed on the dissolution 
reactions and reactions of the dissolved solute. These are the types 
of situation usually encountered in nature and in water and waste­
water treatment processes; a typical one is the dissolution of 
CaCO"" from the soil during the passage of sewage effluent in 
groundwater recharge. Gas exchange of CO, with the soil atmos­
phere, oxidation of NH, + to NO, -(nitrification), and reduction of 
NO,-to N,(" (denitrification) are superimposed on the d.issolution 
of CaCO"" and the reaction of CO,'-after CaCO"" dissolution in 
the soil water (Fig. 6-2). 
These four situations are influenced by solution ionic strength. In 
general, the solubility of salts increases with increasing ionic strength. 
The magnitude of this effect can be assessed at most ionic strengths of 
interest to us using the DeBye-Hiickel, or related, laws. 
6.3.!. The Solubility Product

Generally stated. the equilibrium constant. K,o. is

The activity of the solid pliase can be taken as unity (see Section 3-3). The 
concentration product. cKso' has the same form as the equilibrium constant 
except that the concentrations of the species in solution are used instead 
of their activities. Accordingly.

Assuming that the solution components have activity coeffici~nts of unity 
and that the solid has an activity of one. cK,. = K, •. If the activity 
coefficients are not equal to unity, cKso f KSQ and cKso is a function of ionic 
strength. Table 6-1 gives many K,. values of interest to us. 
It is important to differentiate between the terms solubility product and 
solubility. Solubility product is the colloquial term for the equilibrium 
constant. Solubility is the amount of a substance in moleslliter or mglliter 
that can dissolve in a solution under a given set of conditions. Solubility 
does not equal the solubility product. but the two quantities are interre­
lated. 250 Precipitation and Dissolution 
Example 6·1 
Calculate the solubility in mg/liter of CaF2 in pure water qt 25°C, neglecting 
ionic strength effects. 
Solution 
(I) K" = 5 x 10-" = 'K" = [CaH][F-l' 
Each mole of CaF2 that dissolves in pure water produces I mole of Ca2+ 
and 2 moles of F-. Therefore, if we set S = solubility in moles/liter, we can 
write 
(2) [CaH) = S 
and 
(3) [F-) = 2S 
From (I). (2). and (3) 
S(2S)' = 4S' = 5 x 10-" 
Therefore. S = 2.32 X 10-4 molesiliter. 
The molecular weight of CaF2 is 78; therefore, 
S = 78 g/mole x 2.32 x 10-' molesiliter x 10' mg/g = 18.1 mglliter. 
It can be difficult to judge the solubility of a substance from its solubility 
product. For example. silver chloride. AgCl. has a K" = 1 X 10-10• and 
silver chromate has a K,o = 2.5 X 10-12• Which silver salt will allow the 
greater solution concentration of silver ion. Ag+. at equilibrium? This is 
equivalent to asking the question. which salt has the greater solubility? 
For AgCl at 25'C. neglecting ionic strength. we have S = [Ag+] and S 
= [Cl-]. and 
(S)(S) = K" = 10-10 
Therefore. 
S = "10-5 molelliter 
For Ag,CrO,. under conditions where CrO.'-does not hydrolyze. [CrO.'-] 
= Sand [Ag+] = 2S, 
(S)(2S)' = K" = 2.5 X 10-12 
Therefore. 
S = 8.6 X 10-5 moleslliter 
Thus. although the solubility product of Ag,CrO, is more than 2 orders of 
magnitude smaller than the solubility product of AgCI. it happens that 
Ag,CrO, is about 8 times more soluble than AgCl and [Ag+] is about 17 
times greater in the Ag,CrO, solution. This fact is used in the argentimetric Equilibrium CalCulations 251 
method for determining chloride.6 In this method a solution containing an 
unknown amount of chloride is titrated with silver nitrate solution in the 
presence of a small amount of the yellow·colored potassium chromate 
{used as an indicator}. Silver chloride {white} precipitates first, since AgCl 
is less soluble than Ag,CrO,. When sufficient Ag+ has been added to 
lower the Cl-concentration to less than 10-5 moleslliter, the red Ag,CrO, 
starts to precipitate, indicating the endpoint of the titration. 
6.3,2, Effect of Temperature on Solubility 
Temperature affects both the equilibrium position of the precipitation 
reaction and the reaction rate. In general, solubility increases with 
increasing temperature with a few notable exceptions such as CaCO" 
Ca3{PO,}" CaSO" and FePO" which are of importance in water chemistry. 
The effect of temperature on equilibrium is presented in Section 3·4 and 
the following example illustrates the effect on a typical precipitation 
reaction. 
Example 6-2

6.3.3. The Common Ion Effect 
-When a solution contains an ion that is the same as one of the ions 
which result from the dissolution of the solid, the solubility of the solid 
will be less than that when the solid dissolves in pure water. The 
modification of solubility is called the common ion effect. When calcu­
lating the solubility of the solid in such a solution, we need to remember 
that the solubility is based on ions or species lhat come only from the 
dissolution of the solid. 
Example 6-3 
The solubility of stannous fluoride, SnF2{s), in water at 20°C is 0.012 g/100 ml. 
What is the solubility of SnF2{sl in a 0.08 M NaP solution neglecting ionic strength 
effects? 
Solution 
Let us first calculate the concentration product for the reaction, 
SnF2{s) ~ SnH + 2F~ 
K~ ~ 'K~ ~ [Sn'+][F-]' 
The molecular weight of SnF2 is 156.6 
Therefore, g 1000 ml I mole 
S ~ 0.012 100 ml x Iliter x IS6.6 -g-
= 7.7 x 10 -4 moleslliter 
'K~ ~ (7.7 x 10-')(7.7 x 10-' x 2)' 
~ 1.8 x 10-9 / 
Now let S' = moleslliter of SnF2, which will dissolve. If 8 x 10-2 mole of F-/liter 
is originally present, 
and [F-] ~ (8 x 10-' + 2S') 
[Sn'+] ~S' 
'K~ ~ (8 x 10-' + 2S')'(S') ~ 1.8 X 10-9 
For this example let us assume that 2S' is negligible compared to 8 x 10-2• Then 
'K~ ~ [S'][O.08]' ~ 1.8 x 10-9 
S' 1.8 X 10-9 
(0.08)' 2.8 x 1O-7moleslliter 
Checking OUI assumption that 8 x 10-2 > 2S', we see that 2S' = 5.6 X 10-7 « 
8 x 10-2. The assumption is valid. 
We see from this example that the solubility of SnF, is reduced from 7.7 \ r Equilibrium Galculations 253 
X 10-4 mole/liter to 2.8 X 10-7 molelliter by the presence of 0.08 M F-. A 
similar calculation shown in Example 6·4 for a solution containing 10-4 
mole NaFlliter ,:;hows essentially no decrease in solubility caused by the 
common ion. 
Example 6-4 
What is the solubility of SnF2 in a 10-4 molelliter NaP solution? Neglect ionic 
strength effects. 
Solution 
From Example 6·3, 
'K"" ~ 3.5 x 10-9 
Let [Sn2+] ~ S'. Then 
and 
'K "" ~ (S ')(10-4 + 28 'J' 
Assuming that 2 S' « 10-4, we obtain 
S' ~ 3.5 x 10-9 
(10 ~' 0.35 
Checking the assumption that 2S' « 10-4, we find 2S' = 7 X 10-1, which is not 
« 10-4, The assumption is not valid. We will therefore proceed as we did in the 
solution of acid-base equilibrium problems and make the opposite assumption, 
that is, assume that 2S I » 10-4, Then 
S' ~ 9.6 X 10-4 
Checking the assumption. we find 2S' = 19.2 X 10-4» 10-4 so that the assumption 
is acceptable and the solubility is 9.6 X 10-4 molelliter. 
6.3.4. Conditional Solubility Product 
As the name implies, a conditional solubility product is one whose 
value depends on solution conditions other than the presence of a common 
ion. Conditional solubility products are useful when determining the 
solubility of precipitates whose ions interact with solution constituents 
through reactions such as complexation or hydrolysis. This type of 
behavior is indeed the rule rather than the exception for the systems 
encountered in natural waters and treatment processes. Also, in many 
analytical measurements the total concentration of species is determined 
rather than the free ion concentration. 
The conditional solubility product has the form 
(6-6) 254 Precipitation and Dissolution 
where 
P, = conditional solubility product 
CLM = total concentration of the metal ion M in all of its 
complex forms and 
CT,A = total concentration of the anion A in all of its forms 
The value of P, may change as a function of solution properties such as 
pH and concentration of complex-forming species because the fractions 
of CT,M and CT,A present as the free cation and anion may vary as a 
function of these properties. 
The conditional solubility product and K,,, the solubility product. are 
related. For ariy set of conditions. if aM = fraction of CT•M present as the 
free metal ion. [M+] = aM (CT•M). and if aA = fraction of CT•A present as free 
anion. [A -] = aA (CT.')' Then 
or 
Therefore. 
Example 6-5 
Will CaC0 3{s) precipitate at pH 9.1 from a solution containing CT,Ca = 10-2 M, 
CT,COl = 10-3 M? The ionic strength is 10-2 and P s = 10-6.7 at pH 9.1. 
Solution 
(C T.C,)(C T.CO) = 10 -2 X 10 -3 = 10 -, 
Since Ps = 10-6.7 < 10-5, the solution is supersaturated and CaC03(S) will 
precipitate. 
6.3.5. Log Concentration Diagrams 
The presentation of precipitation equilibria on log concentration dia­
grams greatly aids the solution of problems and the understanding of 
these equilibria. For example. consider Ca(OH)"" and sparingly soluble 
Mg(OH)"". both of which are important in water treatment; Ca(OH)"" or 
hydrated (slaked) lime is commonly used to bring about the precipitation 
of Ca2+ as CaCO"" and Mg2+ as Mg(OH)"". The equilibrium relationships 
at 25'C are 
Ca(OH)"" ¢ Ca2+ + 20H-; 
Mg(OH)"" ¢ Mg2+ + 20H-; logK50 = -5.3 
10gK50= -10.74 Equilibrium Calculations 255 
Assuming that the activity effects are negligible, that is, activity coeffi­
cients are unity: 7 
or 
log [CaH] + 2 log [OH-] -5.3 
or 
-log [CaH] + 2pOH = 5.3 
Similarly, for Mg(OH)"", (6-7) 
-log [Mg2+] + 2pOH = 10.74 (6-8) 
Equations 6-7 and 6-8 can be plotted as a log concentration diagram (Fig. 
6-3). This diagram can be used handily to solve a variety of problems.

Example 6-6 
Find the solubility of (I) Ca(OH)",) and (2) Mg(OH)",) in distilled water. 
Solution 
(I) Ca(OH)",) 
In addition to the equilibrium relationship for Ca(OH)2(s)' Eq. 6·7, and Kw for 
water, which are presented in Fig. 6·3, the charge balance equation must be 
satisfied, that is, 
2[CaH] + [H+] ~ [OH-] 
Assuming that [H+] « 2[CaH], 
2[CaH] ~ [OH-] 
0.3 + log [CaH] ~ log [OW] 
or 
pOH ~ -log [CaH] -0.3 
Plotting the line (-log [CaH] -0.3), we find this equation is satisfied at point A 
in Fig. 6-3 (pOH ~ 1.7). The assumption that [H+] « 2[CaH] is valid at this point. 
When pOH ~ 1.7, from Fig. 6·3 we find -log [Ca2+] = 2. Since S ~ [Ca2+], 
S ~ 1O-2M 
(2) Mg(OH)",) 
Similarly, the charge balance for dissolution of Mg(OH}2(s) in distilled water is 
2[MgH] + [H+] ~ [OW] 
which is satisfied at point B in Fig. 6·3. At this point. pOH ~ 3.5. When pOH ~ 
3.5. -log [Mg2+] ~ 3.8. Thus 
s ~ [Mg2+] ~ 10-3.8 
or 
s ~ 1.6 x 10-' M 
Example 6-7 
Sodium hydroxide is added to a groundwater containing 10-4 M Mg2+ and 10-3 
M CaH• At what pH will Mg(OH)",) begin to precipitate? Will Ca(OH)",) precipitate 
at this pH? At what pH will [Mg2+] be reduced to 10-8 M? The temperature is 25°C. 
Solution 
From Fig. 6-3, we find that the 10-4 M Mg2+ solution is in equilibrium with 
Mg(OH)",) only at pH 10.65 (point C). Thus Mg(OH)",) will precipitate when the pH 
exceeds 10.65. At this pH, the solution is very much undersaturated with Ca(OH)2(s)' 
(From the diagram we see that more than 1 M Ca2+ is required for a saturated 
solution.) 
Again from the diagram in Fig. 6·3, when [Mg2+1 = 10-6 M and the solution is 
in equilibrium with Mg(OH)",), the pH is 11.65 (point D). Equilibrium Calculations 257 
Master variables other than pH and pOH can be used in log concentra­
tion diagrams. Diagrams using the negative logarithm of concentrations 
of other ions are often useful in the solution of solubility problems. As an 
example consider the carbonate salts of Ca2+ and Mg2+: 
CaCO,(,) ¢ Ca2+ + 'CO,'-; 
MgC03(,) ¢ Mg'+ + CO,'-; -log K" = 8.34 
-logK,o = 5 
These equilibria can be represented in linear form as follows: 
-log [Ca'+] -log [CO,'-] = 8.34 
or 
-log [Ca2+] + pCO, = 8.34 
and (6-9) 
-log [Mg'+] + pCO, = 5 (6-10) 
where pCO, = -log [CO,'-j. Since the carbonate species is common to 
each of the precipitates, it is useful as a master variable. Equations 6-9 
and 6-10 are plotted in a log concentration diagram (Fig. 6-4), which can 
be used to solve problems such as those in Examples 6-8 and 6-9.

concentration of CO,'-will (I) [Ca2+), and (2) [Mg'+) be reduced by one order of 
magnitude at equilibrium? 
Solution 
1. 10-3 M Ca2+ is in equilibrium with CaC03iS) when pC03 = 5.3 (point A. Fig. 
6-4). To reduce the Ca2+ concentration to 10-4• pC03 must be reduced to 4.3. 
that is. the C032-concentration must be increased to 10-4.3 M at equilibrium 
(point B, Fig. 6·4). 
2. Similarly for Mg'+, if [Mg'+) = 5 x 10-' at equilibrium, pCO, = 1.7 ([CO,'-) 
= 10-"') M, (point C, Fig. 6·4). When pCO, = 0,7, [Mg'+] = 5 x 10-'. 
Example 6-9 
The pH of the initial solution in Example 6-8 is 8.3 and the total alkalinity is 3 
x 10-' eqiliter. All of the alkalinity is converted to CO,'-by adding OH-. After 
this conversion. is there sufficient COl-present to begin to precipitate the Ca2+ 
and the Mg"? 
Solution 
After conversion of 3 x 10-3 eq/liter of alkalinity (all present as HC03 -) to C032-, 
pCO, = -log (3 x 10-') = 2.5. From Fig. 6·4, when [Ca") = 10-' and pCO, = 2.5, 
point D. the solution is supersaturated with CaCOJ and it will precipitate. When 
[Mg") = 5 x 10-' (-log [Mg'+) = 3.3) and pCO, = 2.5, point E, the solution is 
undersaturated with MgC03 and thus it will not precipitate. 
6.4. SOLUBILITY OF SALTS OF WEAK ACIDS AND BASES 
Precipitation and dissolution phenomena become more complicated if 
the cation of the salt is a weak acid, such as NH,+, or if the anion is a 
weak base, such as CN-or CO,'-. AgCN"" for example, dissolves as 
follows: 
AgCN ,,' ;;=: Ag+ + CN-; 10gK" = -13.8 (6-11) 
and the CN-ion reacts with water 
log Kb = -4.85. 
or alternatively, 
CN-+ W ;;=: HCN; I 
log K, = 9.15 (6-12) 
Example 6-10 illustrates the effect of protonation of CN-on the solubility 
of AgCN. Solubility of Salts of Weak Acids and Bases 259 
Example 6-10 
Find the solubility of AgCN{s) in distilled water'in a closed system (volatile HeN 
can not escape), neglecting ionic strength effects and Ag+ complexes. 
Solution 
The unknowns are S. [Ag+]. [HCN]. [CN-]. [W]. and [OW]. Six independent 
equations are thus required. 
The equilibrium constants for Eqs. S·ll and 6-12 can be used together with the 
mass balances, 
S ~ [Ag+] ~ CT . ., 
~ [HCN] + [CN-] ~ CUN 
the equilibrium constant. 
Kw ~ 10-" ~ [H+][OH-] 
and the electroneutrality equation, 
[WI + [Ag+] ~ [CN-] + [OW] (S-13) 
(S-14) 
(S-15) 
(S·IS) 
The most straightforward way to solve these equations is to substitute in the 
electroneutrality equation to'obtain an equation with one unknown, say [H+J, and 
then to solve it by trial and error. First. combine Eqs. 6-12 and 6-14 to yield 
and 
Also.

Therefore, ] Kw [OW ~ [H+]

For an assumed pH, we can determine U1 from Eq. 6-17, or from Appendix 1. Using 
these values, we then determine if Eq. 6·19 is satisfied. I~ not. a new value of pH 260 Precipitation and Dissolution 
is assumed and the process is repeated. The results of this process are given in 
Table 6·2. Plotting the value of Eq. 6·19 versus the assumed pH and extrapolating 
will enable good successive estimates of pH to be obtained.8 We first plot the 
value of Eq. 6·19 (see Fig. 6·5a) at pH 7 and pH 8. The value changes from positive 
to negative at approximately pH 7.7. Further narrowing it down, we plot the value 
of Eq. 6-19 at pH 7.7 and pH 7.8, and from the graph (Fig. 6·5b) determine that the 
left-hand side of Eq. 6-19 has a value of zero at approximately pH 7.78. Rounding 
off to the nearest tenth of a pH unit, that is. pH 7.8, we find that

Fig. 6·5. Solution to Eq. 6-19. \ 
It is interesting to examine the solubility of salts such as AgCN as a 
function of pH. For the purposes of this example let us assume that the 
solution pH is controlled by the addition of a strong acid or a strong base. 
Because we wish to obtain S as a function of pH, one less equation is 
needed than when the solubility of AgCN was determined in distilled 
water (Example 6-10). Usually, the electroneutrality equation is eliminated 
making it unnecessary to determine or know the amount of strong acid 
or strong base added. 
Example 6-11 
Determine the solubility of AgCN as a function of pH in a closed system.

The six unknowns are S, [Ag+], [CN-] , [HCN], [H+], and [OW]. The required 
number of equations is 5 (number of unknowns ..:....1).

Thus at pH < 9.1S the solubility is a function of pH, increasing as pH decreases.

Both of the preceding examples were solved for closed systems so that 
HCN could not leave the liqUid. If the system were open so that HCN 
could escape, the concentration at equilibrium would be a function of the 
HCN partial pressure; in an open system with no HCN,,} in the atmosphere 
above the liquid the equilibrium concentration in solution would be zero. 
6,5, EFFECT OF COMPLEXATION ON SOLUBILITY 
When any of the constituent ions of a solid participate in complex 
formation following dissolution, there will be an increase in the solubility 
of the solid. Consider the dissolution of cadmium hydroxide, Cd(OH)",}, 
in water, the pH of which is controlled at 9.0 using strong acid or base. 
Cadmium is of particular importance because of the adverse health 
effects that it can cause if it is consumed in sufficient quantities. The 
following reactions are important. 
(I) Cd(OH)",}:;=: Cd'+ + 20H-; log K '0 = -13.65 
(2) Cd(OH)",}:;=: CdOH+ + OH-; log K" = -9.49 
(3) Cd(OH),(,):;=: Cd(OH),O; log K" = -9.42 
(4) Cd(OH),(,} + OH-:;=: HCdO,-+ H,O; log K,,= -12.97 
(5) Cd(OH),(,} + 20H-:;=: CdO,'-+ 2H,O; log K" = -13.97 
Since the solution is equilibrated at pH 9, the solubility, CT•Cd, can Effect of Complexation on Solubility 263 
readily be calculated from the equilibrium equations. Since [OH-] = 10-', 
from (1) we find I 
K 10-13•65 
[Cd2+] _ '0_ -[OH-], -(10-')' 
= 10-3.65 
From (2), 
K 10-9.49 
[CdOW] = [O~'-] = 10-' 
= 10-,·49 
From (3), 
[Cd(OH),O] = K" = 10-9.42 
From (4), 
[HCdO, -] = K ,,[OH-] = 10-12•97 X 10-5 = 10-17.97 
From (5), 
[CdO,'-] = K ,,[OH-], = 10-13.97 X (10-5)' = 10-23•97 
From the mass balance on cadmium, 
CT.Cd = [Cd'+] + [CdOH+] + [Cd(OH),O] + [HCdO,-] + [CdO,'-] 
= 10-3.65 + 10-4·49 + 10-9.42 + 10-17.97 + 10-23•97 
CT.Cd=' 2.56 X 10-' M = S 
This value can be compared to a solubility of 10-3.65 or 2.24 X 10-', the 
concentration of Cd2+ in equilibrium with Cd(OH),(,). that would result if 
there were no complexes. Thus for cadmium hydroxide the formation of 
hydroxocadmium(II) complexes increases the solubility by approximately 
14 percent. As the pH is increased, the various complex forms become 
more dominant; at lower pH values they are not present in significant 
concentrations. 
Let us now assume that in addition to the hydroxide ion. there is 
sufficient Cl-in solution so that the free Cl-concentration is 10-3 M. To 
calculate CT.Cd and CT.CI the following reactions are important as well as 
those for the hydroxo complexes. 
Cd'+ + Cl-'" CdCl+; 
CdCl+ + Cl-'" CdC!,o; 
CdCl,o + Cl-'" CdCl,-; 
CdCI 3-+ Cl-'" CdCll-; log K, = 1.32 
log K, = 0.90 
log K3 = 0.09 
log K, = -0.45 
The concentrations of the chlorocadmium(II) complexes are 264 Precipitation and Dissolution 
[CdCl+] = [Cd2+][Cl-]K 1 
= 10-3.65 X 10-3 X 101.32 = 10-5.33 M 
[CdCl,O] = [CdCl+][Cl-]K, 
= 10-5.33 X 10-3 X 10"-' = 10-7.43 M 
[CdC13-] = [CdCl,O][Cl-]K 3 
= 10-7.43 X 10-3 X 10°·09 = 10-10.34 M 
[CdCll-] = [CdC13-][Cl-]K4 
= 10-10.34 X 10-3 X 10-0.45 = 10-13.79 
The total dissolved cadmium concentration is 
CT.Cd = [Cd'+] + [CdOW] + [Cd(OH),O] + [HCdO,-] + [CdO,'-] 
+ [CdCl+] + [CdCl,O] + [CdC13 -] + [Cd(Cl)l-] 
= 2.61 X 10-4 M 
Thus the presence of 10-3 M Cl-has increased the total dissolved 
cadmium concentration even further. Although the increase is approxi­
mately 2 percent in this example because of the CI-concentration 
selected, quite significant increases in solubility are observed in solutions 
such as seawater, where the CI-concentration is approximately 20 glliter 
or 0.56 M. In seawater of pH 8 the solubility of cadmium hydroxide 
(including all hydroxo and chlorocomplexes) is approximately 10+0.3' M 
compared with 10-1.65 M if no Cd(II) complexes were formed. This is an 
increase of 110 times in cadmium solubility. In seawater the major 
dissolved species is CdCI,o. The solubilization of metals such. as cadmium 
and mercury by the formation of soluble chloro complexes has significance 
in relation to marine waste disposal. The discharge of freshwater streams 
containing these metals in suspension to a saline environment could well 
result in increased dissolved metal levels because of the formation of 
dissolved chloride complexes. 
The hydroxo complexes, or hydrolysis products, of the trivalent metal 
ions and many other divalent metal ions have a dramatic effect on the 
solubility of these ions. Consider the following equilibria that relate to 
the behavior of Fe'+ in pure water: 
Fe3+ + H,O;= FeOH'+ + H+; 
Fe3+ + 2H,O;= Fe(OH),+ + 2H+; 
Fe(OH)3(";= Fe'+ + 30H-; 
Fe3+ + 4H,O;= Fe(OH)4 -+ 4H+; 
2Fe'+ + 2H,O;= Fe,(OH),4+ + 2H+; 10gK, = -2.16 
10gK = -6.74 
10gK,o = -38 
10gK = -23 
10gK = -2.85 
The effect of these hydroxo complexes on solubility is most conveniently 
illustrated by using a pC-pH diagram. To plot these equations on a pC­
pH diagram requires that they be expressed in terms of soluble Fe (Ill) Effect of Complexation on Solubility 265 
species, H+ and Fe(OH),{,). We can rearrange these equations so that each 
Fe(I1I) species is in equilibrium with Fe(OH);(,) and then assume that the 
activity of the solid Fe(OH),{,) is unity so that the equilibrium constant is 
then in terms of soluble Fe(III) and H+. For example, adding the equations, 
Fe'+ + H20;;=: Fe(OH)2+ + H+; 10gK, = -2.16 
Fe(OH),{,);;=: Fe'+ + 30H-; log K,o = -38 
W + OR-;;=: H20; log( L) = 14 
we obtain 
(l) Fe(OH),{,);;=: Fe(OH)2+ + 20H-; log K" = -26.16 
Similarly. we can derive equations for [Fe(OH)2+]' [Fe(OH),-], and 
[Fe,(OH), '+] 
(2) Fe(OH)3(,);;=: Fe(OH), + + OH-; log K" = -16.74 
(3) Fe(OH),{,) + OH-;;=: Fe(OH),-; log K" = -5 
(4) 2Fe(OH)3(,);;=: Fe,(OH),4+ + 40H-; log K = -50.8 
Equations (l) through (4) can be plotted on a pC-pH diagram. For example, 
for equation (1), which describes the behavior of the species Fe(OH)2+ 
with pH in a solution in equilibrium with Fe(OH)3(,), 
K" = [Fe(OH)2+][OH-l' 
Taking logarithms, we obtain 
log K" = -26.16 = log [Fe(OH)2+] + 2 log [OH-] 
or 
log [Fe(OH)2+] = 2pOH -26.16 
and since pH + pOH = 14 
log [Fe(OH)'+] = 1.84 -2pH 
This equation plots as line 1 in Fig. 6·7. 
Similarly, for equation (2), describing the behavior of Fe(OH),+ species, 
we have 
or log [Fe(OH), +] = log K" + pOH 
log [Fe(OH), +] = -16.74 + 14 -pH 
log [Fe(OH), +] = -2.74 -pH

Fig. 6·7. Equilibrium concentrations of hydroxo iron(III) complexes in a 
solution in contact with freshly precipitated Fe{OHh(s) at 25°C. 
which is line 3 in Fig. 6-7. For [Fe,(OH),4+] we find 
log [Fe,(OH),4+] = 5.2 -4pH 
which is line 4 in Fig. 6-7. The line for Fe3+ is obtained from the K" 
equation as 
log [Fe3+] = 4 -3pH 
and is drawn as line 5 in Fig. 6-7. This completes the pC-pH diagram for 
the species considered. 
From an inspection of this diagram we can sketch in the region where 
Fe(OH)",j will precipitate. Since all of the lines represent the concentra­
tions that may exist at various pH values when in equilibrium with solid 
Fe(OH)",j, we can reason that any concentration of a particular species Effect of Complexation on Solubility 267 
above the line in the diagram will be supersaturated with respect· to 
Fe(OH)"" for that species. Moreover we can reason that the Fe(OH)"" 
boundary will be somewhere above the line that is at the highest 
concentration of iron species at any point in the diagram. For example. 
let us examine the situation at' pH 4. As we move vertically up the 
diagram, we first encounter the line for [Fe(OH),-] at 10-15 M; next we 
encounter the line for [Fe,(OH),4+] at 10-10 .• M; next is the [Fe'+] line at 
10-' M, then the Fe(OH),+ line at 10-6•74 M and last the FeOH'+ line at 
10-6.16 M. The boundary of Fe(OH)"" at this pH is at the point represented 
by the sum of these concentrations, that is, CT.Fo(ll1) = [Fe'+] + [FeOH2+] 
+ [Fe(OH),+] + 2[Fe,(OH),4+] + [Fe(OH),-]. 
CT"'IlIIl =. 10-' + 10-6.16 + 10-6•74 + 2 X 10-10 •• + 10-15 
= 10-6.05 
By performing such an exercise at various pH values throughout the 
diagram, we can sketch in the Fe(OH)"" boundary. Intuition tells us that 
if one species predominates at a particular pH, then its concentration 
will coincide closely with the Fe(OH)"" boundary. We can see this 
happening in a couple of places in Fig. 6-7. Thus at pH values higher 
than 9, Fe(OH), -predominates and its concentration line is the Fe(OH)"" 
boundary in this region. Between pH 5-7 Fe(OH),+ is the predominant 
species and likewise it forms the solution boundary for Fe(OH)"". 
We can use pC-pH diagrams that include heterogeneous equilibria for 
the rapid evaluation of both the total concentration of all species present 
as well as to provide a graphic representation of the concentrations of 
individual species present at various pH values. From Fig. 6-7, for 
example, we can deduce that in the pH range from 4.5 to 8 (which covers 
virtually all natural waters), Fe(OH), + is the predominant soluble ferric 
iron species. The polymer (dimer) Fe,(OH),4+ does not predominate at any 
pH value, but it is a significant species at pH values below about 2.5. It 
is important to note that Fe'+, ferric ion, controls the solubility of Fe(OH)"" 
only below about pH 2.5. Conversely stated, at typically encountered 
natural water pH values in the presence of Fe(OH)"", Fe'+ is a minor 
component of the ferric iron species. 
A word of caution in the use of pC-pH diagrams that include hetero­
geneous equilibria is in order at this point. First, we must always realize 
that these diagrams are equilibrium diagrams. For them to be validly 
applied to the solution of natural water problems, we must assure 
ourselves that the solid of interest is present and that a heterogeneous 
equilibrium truly does exist. Second, for diagrams that involve solids 
containing an anion other than hydroxide, we must stipulate a certain 
solution concentration for that anion. For such precipitates (and we shall 
consider aluminum phosphate, AlPO"", as an example later) there is a 
unique pC -pH diagram for each concentration of the anion. 268 Precipitation and Dissolution

An acid industrial waste discharge containing a high ferrous iron concentration 
is discharged into an oxygenated receiving water that has a neutral pH and is 
well buffered. What problems (if any) can be expected in the stream from increased 
dissolved iron? (Assume that only hydroxo complexes are of importance.) 
Solution 
First, ferrous iron will be rather rapidly oxidized to ferric iron at neutral pH in 
oxygenated water; thus only Fe(lll) species are of interest. Second. since the water 
is well buffered and we are adding an acid waste, we should be interested in pH 
values below but near neutrality. Using Fig. 6-7 and knowing that Cr,Fe(lm is the 
sum of all the concentrations of species present at a given pH. we find that total 
soluble Fe(III) concentration is 10-9 to 10-10 M, or 0.06 to 0.006 p.g Fe/liter, a minute 
amount. (The major problem may well be caused by the Fe(OHh{s) that precipitates 
and either settles to the stream bottom or is carried in suspension.) 
Aluminum ion, AI'+, behaves very much like Fe'+ in solution except 
that it has a greater tendency to form polynuclear species. For the 
equilibria that exist in the presence of freshly precipitated aluminum 
hydroxide, AI(OH)3('), we have 
(I) AI'+ + H,O "" AI(OH)2+ + W; log K, ~ -5 
(2) 7AI'+ + 17H,O "" AI,(OH)174+ + l7H+; 
(3) l3AI'+ + 34H,O "" AI,,(OH),r + 34H+; 
(4) AI(OH)3(,) "" AI'+ + 30H-;

These equations can be rearranged so that the concentration of each 
complex is expressed as an equilibrium with solid AI(OH)3(,) as was done 
for Fe(OH)3(,). The pC-pH diagram plotted from these equations (Fig. 6.8a) 
shows that the large, highly charged polymeric species such as AI,,(OH),.5+ 
and AI,(OH)174+ control AI(OH)3(5) solubility below a pH value of approxi.

From Fig. 6·8a at pH 6.5 and 9 the values of the total aluminum species in

At both pH values the filter alum precipitates as Al(OH)3{," However, at 
pH 6.5 (which is close to the pH of minimum solubility of AI(OH)3{,') the 
solution concentration of aluminum species is about two orders of 
magnitude less than at pH 9.0. Further, at pH 9,62 percent of the aluminum 
added [(3.16 x 10-'/5.05 x 10-')(100)] does not precipitate. 
Aluminum hydroxide precipitated freshly, for example, when filter alum 
is added to water in the water treatment process of coagulation, is more 
soluble than the thermodynamically-stable Al(OH)"" phase, gibbsite. 
This material has the same composition but a different, more well-defined 
crystal structure. The solubility product for gibbsite is 
log K" = -36.3 
which is slightly smaller than the value of 10-" for the freshly precipitated 
solid. Combining equation (7) with equations (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) and 
plotting yields the pC-pH diagram shown in Fig. 6-Sb. A comparison of 
the pC-pH diagram for gibbsite with the diagram for freshly precipitated 
Al(OH)3{,' shows that gibbsite predominates over a much larger region 
than does freshly precipitated AI(OH)3{'" Also, in equilibrium with gibb­
site, AI'+ rather than the polymeric AI-species tends to predominate below 
pH values of about 5. This observation is consistent with the proposition 
that polymeric aluminum species are formed as intermediates between 
Al'+ and the precipitation of Al(OH)3{'" 
Other species can compete with OH-for coordination sites on Al(III). As 
evidence that such competition takes place, it can be shown' that the 
amount of OH-which must be' added to a solution to bring about the 
formation of Al(OH)"" is less when phosphates are present in solution 
than when they are not. Competitive effects probably cause a difference 
in coagulation phenomena based on a difference in the ligand concen­
trations in the water being treated. 
S.S. COMPETITIVE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL LIGANDS 
In the preceding discussions we examined only the equilibrium of 
solids with pure water or with solutions containing an ion common to o1.1e

Works Assoc .. 54: 971 (1962). Competitive Effects of Several Ligands 271 
of the constituent ions of the solid. This type of situation is rare in natural 
waters and wastewaters where there are a wide variety of ligands that 
can influence both the solubility of a solid and, indeed, govern the type 
of solid that forms. Two examples of this type of situation will be 
presented: the precipitation of ferrous hydroxide, Fe(OH)"", and ferrous 
carbonate, FeCO"", as may occur during the lime-soda softening of an 
iron-bearing groundwater; and the precipitation of aluminum hydroxide, 
AI(OH)"", and aluminum phosphate, AIP04{,', as may occur when alum 
is added to wastewater to remove phosphate. 
6.6.1. Precipitation of Fe(OH)"" and FeCO",,-pC-pH and 
Predominance Area Diagrams 
1. pC-pH Diagrams. We approach this problem by determining which 
soluble Fe(II) species exist in our system which might influence the 
solubility of the two solids. The following equilibria are pertinent to this 
case: 
Fe(OH)"" "'" Fe'+ + 20H-; log K" = -14.5 
Fe(OH)"" "'" FeOH+ + OH-; log K" = -9,4 
Fe(OH)"" + OH-"'" Fe(OH), -; log K" = -5.1 
log K" = -10.7 
FeCO"" + OH-"'" FeOH+ + CO,'-; 
FeCO"" + 30H-"'" Fe(OH), -+ CO,'-; log K = -5.6 
10gK = -1.3 (6-20) 
(6-21) 
(6-22) 
(6-23) 
(6-24) 
(6-25) 
Using Eqs. 6-20 through 6-25, it is possible to construct two types 
diagrams to show the region of pH and total Fe(II) concentration over 
which each solid phase can exist. The first diagram is the pC -pH diagram 
as previously constructed for AI(OH)",,; the second type is a predominance 
area diagram. The pC-pH diagram is constructed as follows: 
I. Sketch a diagram for a solution containing all soluble Fe(II) species 
in equilibrium with Fe(OH)"". (If carbonato complexes were of 
importance. they would be included.) 
2. Sketch a diagram showing all soluble Fe(II) species in equilibrium 
with FeCO,(s) for a constant total soluble carbonate concentration. 
Cr.cc, = [H,CO;] + [HCO,-] + [CO,'-]. Note that a different diagram 
results if we use a different concentration of Cr.cc,. In the example 
we will use CT•CC, = IO-'M and assume that we are dealing with a 
closed. constant CT•CC, system. 
3. Combine the above two diagrams to show 0) the variation of soluble 
Fe(II) concentration with pH and (ii) the regions where the FeCO"" 
and Fe(OH)"" precipitates predominate. 272 Precipitation and Dissolution 
Equations 6-20, 6-21, and 6-22 can be used to construct pC-pH diagrams 
'in the same manner as for the Fe(OH)3(,) and Al(OH)3(') diagrams con­
structed previously (Figs, 6-7 and 6-8). The equations plotted in Fig. 6-9 
and their corresponding line numbers are 
log [Fe'+] = 13.5 -2pH; line 1 
log [FeOW] = 4.6 -pH; line 2 
log [Fe(OH), -] = pH -19.1; line 3 
The boundary line of CU"))) = [Fe2+] + [F\"OH+] + [Fe(OH)3-] is shown 
in Fig. 6-9 and defines the cross-hatched area of predominance of 
Fe(OH)2(,)' 
The next step in construction of the diagram is to draw the area of 
predominance for FeC03,,). To do this, we must first determine the 
variation of [CO,'-] with pH for CT,co, = 10-3. From Chapter 4, Fig. 4-17, 
the variation of [C03'-] with pH is as plotted in Fig. 6-10, line 1. The 
FeCO",,) solubility product equation, Eq. 6-23 must be satisfied and, 
therefore, in a pC -pH diagram it will be a mirror image of the [C03'-] line 
such that 
log [Fe'+] + log [C03'-] = -10.7 
Knowing the variation of [CO,'-] with pH. we can plot the log [Fe'+] line 
in Fig. 6-10 (line 2). If we had a hypothetical system with no other ligands

save CO,'-, line 2 would represent the boundary of the predominance 
region for FeCO"". However, the ligand OH-is present in any system in 
equilibrium with solid FeCO"". Assuming for now that Fe(OH)"" is not 
present, the additional hydroxo complexes that need to be considered are 
Fe(OH)+ and Fe(OH),-. Thus, using Eqs. 6-24 and 6-25, we obtain the 
equations for [Fe(OH)+] and [Fe(OH), -] in the presence of FeCO"", 
log [Fe(OH)+] + log [CO,'-] = -19.6 + pH 
and 
log [Fe(OH), -] + log [CO,'-] = -43.3 + 3pH 
Obtaining [CO,'-] at each pH from Fig. 6-10, we can plot the [Fe(OH)+] 
and [Fe(OH),-] lines (lines 3 and 4, respectively, Fig. 6-10). The boundary 
of the FeCO"" predominance region (cross-hatched) is the line for Cr."{fl" 
Combining the predominance regions developed in Figs. 6-9 and 
6-10, we obtain Fig. 6-ll. From it we can determine the regions for a Fe(II) 
-OH--CO,'-system in which either FeCO"" or Fe(OH)"" predominates, 
and the condition under which both solid phases are stable. From this 
diagram it can be seen that the only solid below pH 10.5 is FeCO"" and 
that Fe(OH)"" is the only solid at pH above 10.5. Below pH 10.5, this 
figure shows that FeCO"" is less soluble than Fe(OH)"" (i.e., CT,F,'U) in 
equilibrium with FeCO"" is less than CT",an in equilibrium with Fe(OH)",,) 
and FeCO"" is therefore the solid phase that is stable. Solid Fe(OH), in 274 Precipitation and Dissolution

contact with solutions in this pH range will dissolve and be reprecipitated 
as FeCO",). Above pH 10.5, Fe(OH)",) becomes the least soluble phase so 
that here Fe(lI) is precipitated as Fe(OH)"". That pH 10.5 is the dividing 
line between the two predominance areas, and that both phases are 
stable at pH 10.5 can be shown by combining Eqs. 6-21 and 6-24, thus 
FeOH+ + OH-=<= Fe(OH)",,; I log--K = 9.4 
" 
FeC0 3", + OH-=<= Fe(OH)+ + CO,'-; log K = -5.6 
FeCO"" + 20H-=<= Fe(OH)"" + CO,'-; log K = 3.8

[OH-]' 
Taking logarithms and setting [CO,'-] = 10-3., M, the CO,'-concentration 
at pH 10.5 (see Fig. 6-10), we can show that this equation represents a 
vertical line at pH 10.5. Thus only at one point [pH = 10.5, pCT,f,on = 5.8] 
is the solution in equilibrium with both solid phases. 
2. Predominance Area Diagrams. To present the equilibria in Eqs. 6-20 
to 6-25 on a pC-pH diagram, it was necessary to fix the total carbonate 
concentration. In the second type of diagram-the predominance area 
diagram-we can show the effect of CT•CO, and pH on the predominant 
Fe(II) species. This diagram only shows the predominant species at any 
particular pH, however-not the concentration of each soluble species. 
To sketch such a diagram, it is necessary to fix the maximum total L Competitive Effects of Several Ligands 275 
concentration of Fe(ll). We will assume that the maximum [Fe(II)] is 10-5 
M; this concentration will only be reached 'if all precipitate dissolves. 
There are 5 different species, and it is necessary to develop equations for 
the boundaries between the regions where each of these species predom· 
inate. 
There will be 10 possible equations interrelating all these species as 
follows: 
Fe2+ and FeOH+ 
Fe2+ and Fe(OH)"" 
Fe'+ and Fe(OH),-
Fe2+ and FeCO"" 
FeOH+ and Fe(OH)"" 
FeOH+ and Fe(OH),-
FeOH+ and FeCO"" 
Fe(OH)"" and Fe(OH),-
Fe(OH)"" and FeCO"" 
FeCO"" and Fe(OH),-
We will state these equations and draw the lines they represent on a 
pCT.CO, -pH predominance area diagram; then by deduction we will select 
the areas of predominance for each species. Our approach will be to first 
examine the equilibria between Fe'+ and the various hydroxo complexes, 
since these are independent of CT.co, and will allow the establishment of 
pH regions of the predominance of the various hydroxo species. The task 
of deciding where to draw the lines that describe boundaries between 
hydroxo species and FeCO"" will then be made easier. Selection of the 
first relationship to plot is arbitrary; in this case we begin with Fe(OH)"" 
-Fe(OH),-.

-5.1 = log {Fe(OH)",,} + pOH 276 Precipitation and Dissolution 
When precipitate is present in very small amounts and when 
[Fe(OH), -] = 10-5 M (the maximum soluble concentration), 
pOH = -5.1 + 5.0 = -0.1 and pH = 14.1 
This line is plotted in Fig. 6·12 (line I). It is independent of CT.co, 
and therefore plots as a vertical line at pH 14.1. When the pH is 
below 14.1, Fe(OH),,5' precipitate predominates with respect to 
Fe(OH), -and the concentration of Fe(OH)3 -is less than 10-5 M. We 
can therefore disregard any equilibrium relationships with Fe(OH),­
below pH 14.1 because they represent relationships with minor or 
insignificant quantities relative to Fe(OH)"". Likewise above pH 
14.1 equations containing Fe(OH)"" are not significant. We must 
keep these facts in mind because it will allow us to greatly simplify 
construction of the diagram.

When the precipitate is present and [Fe(OH)+] = lO-s M, pOH = 4.4 
and the pH = 9.6. . 
This is drawn as a vertical line (line 2) at pH 9.6 in Fig. 6·12. At pH 
values below 9.6, FeOH+ predominates. The region of Fe(OH)"s' 
predominance can be deduced to be between pH 9.6 and 14.1. 
3. Fe2+ and FeOH+. 
Combining Eqs. 6·20 and 6-21 yields 
10gK = 5.1 
[FeOW] 
5.1 = log [Fe2+] + pOH 
When [Fe2+] = [Fe(OH)+], pOH = 5.1 and pH = 8.9. 
This is a vertical line at pH 8.9 (line 3, Fig. 6-12). At pH < 8.9, Fe2+ 
predominates. The region of predominance for FeOH+ is defined 
between pH 8.9 and 9.6. 
There is now no reason to determine equations relating the species 
Fe'+ -Fe(OH)"", Fe'+ -Fe(OH)3 -and FeOH+ -Fe(OH)3 -. The boundary 
between Fe2+ and Fe(OH)"s' would fall within the FeOH+ predominance 
region, for example, and because we are interested in only the predom­
inant species, this boundary is not of interest to us. Similar reasoning 
can be applied to the other two pairs of species. 
If no carbonates were present, the diagram would be complete and we 
would not have gained much more useful information from it than would 
be obtainable from the simpler-to-construct pC -pH diagram. However, 
since FeC03", also can form when carbonates are present the boundaries 
between FeCO"" and Fe2+ and the various hydroxo iron(II) species must 
be determined. Since the FeC03", equilibria involve carbonate, we must 
express the variation of [CO,'-] in terms of Cr.co, and pH. 
From Chapter 4, we recall that 
Cr.co, = [H,CO;] + [HC03 -] + [CO,'-] 
K,.1 = 10-6.3 
and 
so that when pH > 10.3,

Let us now determine the relationship between FeCO"" and each of the 
Fe'+ and hydroxo Fe(II) species, starting with Fe(OH), -at very high pH 
values and working our way down to lower pH values. 
4, FeCO"" and Fe(OH),-. 
From Eq. 6-25 we obtain 
FeCO"" + 30H-"" CO,'-+ Fe(OH),-; 
Therefore, log K = -1.3 
[Fe(OH), -] 
-1.3 = log {FeCO",,} + log [CO,'-] -3log [OH-] 
At pH > 14, where Fe(OH), -is predominant, [CO,'-] = CT,co" 
[Fe(OH),-] 
-1,3 = log {FeCO",,} + log CT,co, + 3pOH 
When [Fe(OH), -] = CT,F,aD = 10-5 M and when FeCO"" is present, 
log CT,co, = 3.7 -3pOH 
This boundary exists only at extremely high CT,co, concentrations 
and very high pH values. It is not within the limits of our diagram 
so we cannot plot it. The region it defines is beyond the limits of 
consideration for natural aquatic systems, 
5. FeCO"" and Fe(OH)"".

When both solids are present at eqUilibrium, 
2pOH = 3.8 -log [CO,'-]

Beyond this point Fe(OH)"" is not a malor species so that boundaries 
with it are not considered for this diagram. Examining Fig. 6-12. we 
see that we must seek a boundary between FeCO"" and FeOH+ for 
the pH range from 9.6 to 8.9. 
6. FeCO"" and FeOH+. 
From Eq. 6-24, 
[FeOH+] 
-5.6 ~ log {Fe CO",,} + log [CO,'-] -log [OH-] 
When FeCO"" is present, [FeOH+] ~ 10-5 M, and for pH in the 
region between 6.3 and 10.3 (from Eqs. 6-27),

This expression plots as line 6 in Fig. 6-12.

From Eq. 6-23,

When [Fe'+] ~ 10-5, FeCO"" is present and the solution is between

which plots as line 8 in Fig. 6-12 completing the diagram. 
The diagram in Fig. 6-12 shows the pCT.CO, and pH regions in which 
FeCO"" and Fe.(OH)"" will precipitate, and the regions in which Fe(ll) is 
soluble. The diagram is a function of CT.F,an' but the approach to 
developing diagrams for other CT.F'IIO values is identical to that used here. 
6.6.2. Aluminum Phosphate Precipitation 
Aluminum ion interacts with water to form hydroxo-complexes and 
solid Al(OH)"", and with orthophosphate to form the solid aluminum 
phosphate, AIPO"". The concentrations of PO.'-and OH-, of course, are 280 Precipitation and Dissolution 
a function of pH. We would like to examine the amount of total phosphate 
-that could be present in a solution in equilibrium with AIPO"" at various 
pH values. This knowledge is of importance in certain phosphate removal 
processes, where aluminum sulfate (AI,(SO')3) is added to wastewater to 
remove phosphate as AIPO"". 
We have already examined the precipitation of AI(OH)3(" from solutions 
that do not contain phosphate (see Fig. 6-8). Our approach to this problem 
now will be to develop a pC-pH diagram for AIPO"" precipitation 
assuming no AI(OH)31" precipitates, and then to combine this diagram 
with Fig. 6-8 to obtain a diagram that will give us much useful information 
about the nature of AIPO"" precipitation. We will greatly simplify the 
problem by assuming that (I) we need be concerned only wIth freshly 
precipitated AI(OH)3(," (2) there are no polymeric hydroxo-aluminum(III) 
complexes formed, and (3) the only aluminum phosphate solid formed is 
AIPO, (Le., that no hydroxoaluminum phosphate will form). We will 
examine the importance of these assumptions later. 
First, let us consider the interaction of aluminum ion with water, with 
the only important species in solution being AP+, AIOH2+, and AI(OH).-: 
AP+ + H,O;;=AIOW+ + W; 10gK, = -5.0 (6-29) 
AP+ + 4H,O;;=AI(OH),- + 4W; log K, = -21. 7 (6-30) 
Defining CT•AI = [AP+] + [AIOW+] + [AI(OH),-], we can express [AP+] in 
terms of CT,AI' [H+] and constants as follows: 
CT.AI = [AP+] + [~:] [AP+] + [::]' [AP+] 
= [AP+] ( I + [~:] + I::]') (6-31) 
3+ _ ( K, K, \ -, 
[AI ] -CT•AI I + [W] + [W]'J 
We will now proceed in an identical fashion for the second component 
ion of the AIPO"" precipitate, PO.'-: 
H,PO,;;= H+ + H,PO,-; 
H,PO, -;;= H+ + HPO.'-; log K,., = -2.1 
log K,., = -7.2 (6-32) 
(6-33) 
HPO.'-;;=H+ + PO.'-; logK,.3 = -12.3 (6-34) 
Defining Cuo, = [H,PO,] + [H,PO.-] + [HPOl-] + [pO.'-], we obtain

The solubility product equation

must also be used because the solution is either saturated or supersa­
turated. Assuming for this case tpat CUI =CT.PO" that is, that a stoichi­
ometric amount of aluminum salt is added to the phosphate solution, and 
substituting from Eqs. 6-31 and 6-35 into Eq. 6·36, we obtain

solubility in the neighborhood of pH 5.5. This information is useful to us 
because it indicates that it would be inappropriate to attempt AIPO 4",

pH values below 3 to 4 or above 6 to 7. We might deduce from Fig. 6·13 
that the best place to remove phosphate from wastewater by A1PO"" 
precipitation would be at pH 5.5. This pH is just above the pH (= SA) at 
which we can expect Al(OH)3('( to precipitate if the solid phase is a fresh 
precipitate, but it is somewhat above the pH at which Al(OH)3(,' will 
precipitate if the solid phase is aged Al(OH)3('( (see Fig. 6·8h). Figure 6·13 
shows the curve for CT. po, in equilibrium with Al'+ in the region where 
Al(OH)3(,' (fresh precipitate) controls aluminum solubility. This curve is 
calculated from Eq. 6·37. If Al(OH)3(,' precipitates in addition to A1PO"", 
for example, before equilibrium is achieved, additional aluminum salt 
will have to be added to achieve good phosphate removal. Also, removal 
by phosphate adsorption onto or incorporation into the Al(OH)3(,' precip­
itate is possible.\such removals are not accounted for in Fig. 6·13. 
Results of A1P04\" precipitation from wastewater agree in general with 
the above observations. 10 An optimum pH of about 6 was observed and 
it was necessary to use twice as much aluminum salt as required for 
phosphate precipitation because Al(OH)3(,' also precipitated. Also, the 
Al(OH)"" was of importance because it aided the removal of the fine, 
rather difficult to settie, A1PO,(". 
According to Fig. 6.13, we do not expect Al(OH)3(" to form at pH 5 when 
CT.A,um = 1O~3 to 1O~4 M. Recht and Ghassemi 'o observed Al(OH)3(" 
precipitate at pH above 5, however, indicating that our assumption of 
only pure, freshly precipitated A1P04(" to be the only solid phase present 
was incorrect. The Al(OH)"" may have been aged somewhat, and it did 
contain some phosphate; thus the solid phase was a hydroxoaluminum 
phosphate. Undoubtedly, there were also polymeric forms of hydroxoal­
uminum complexes present, but in spite of these differences, our calcu­
lations allowed us to make a reasonable assessment of what to expect 
when aluminum is used to pre.cipitate phosphate. When making similar 
calculations, all conclusions made should be verified experimentally 
because of the limiting assumptions that must be made. 
6.7. CALCIUM CARBONATE SOLUBILITY AND WATER STABILITY 
6.7.1. Calcium Carbonate Solubility in Open and Closed Systems 
Many of the concepts presented in Chapter 5 and in the previous 
sections of this chapter can be incorporated into calculations concerning 
calcium carbonate, CaCO"". Calcium ion forms weak soluble complexes 
with carbonates, such as CaC030 and CaHC03+, and with hydroxides, 
such as CaOH+ as well as forming the sparingly soluble solid, CaCO"".

of Interior, Federal Water Quality Adm., Cincinnati, 1970. Calcium Carbonate Solubility and Water Stability 283 
Pure calcium carbonate exists in two distinct crystalline forms. These are 
the trigonal solid calcite which in its pure forms has a solubility product 
K", of 10-8.34 and the orthorhombic solid, aragonite, which in pure state 
has K" = 10-8.", both at 25'C. When CaC0 3", precipitation takes place 
from solutions containing high magnesium concentrations, for example, 
seawater with a [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratio of = 0.9 or from the supernatants of 
some anaerobic sludge digesters, a more soluble solid-a so-called 
magnesium calcium carbonate-is formed. Chave et al. 11 found that the 
solubility product of calcium carbonate solid increased from 10-8 to 10-6.3 
as the magnesium carbonate content of the solid increased from 3 to 20 
percent. 
In this section we will consider various situations that involve equilibria 
with CaC0 3",. The following three cases can serve as models for the 
behavior of natural systems in which CaCO"" participates. 
CASE I 
CaC03{sl is dissolving in pure water that is closed to the atmosphere. as shown 
in the following figure. An example in nature of this model system is CaC0 3(S) 
dissolvi!l-S from a sediment into the bottom of a stratified lake. 
CASE 2 
CaC03 dissolving or precipitating in water open to the atmosphere, as shown 
in the following figure. In nature this might apply to CaC0 3(S) dissolving in the 
high PcOz atmosphere of the soil air. When the water rises to the surface (FeO:! = 
1O-3.5atm) in a spring, CaC03(S) may precipitate in the form of the mineral 
travertine.

each constituent appearing in the electroneutrality equation in terms of [H+] and 
constants and then substitute into this equation. The resulting expression can 
then be solved for [H+] by trial-and-error. Then using the determined value for 
[H+], the values of each component can be determined. In making these manip­

an atmosphere containing only 10-'" atmospheres of CO,. The pH of the

has increased from 1.27 X 10-4 M to 5 X 10-4 M (or from 12.7 mglliter as 
CaCO, to 50 mg/liter as CaCO,)-an almost fourfold increase. This 
solubility increase is reflected in increases in alkalinity and total hard­
ness. Comparing these two examples illustrates the solvent effect of CO, 
on carbonate minerals and provides an explanation for the way in which 
groundwaters pick up hardness and alkalinity. Consider the situation in 
a limestone strata that is ip contact with an atmosphere containing 10-' 
atm of CO,--{I reasonable amount of CO, for soil air. The water will have 
a pH of approximately 7.3, and a total hardness and alkalinity of 
approximately 125 to 150 mglliter as CaCO, at equilibrium.

This case is identical to the second case, except that strong acid or strong base 
is added to the system. We must determine the same concentrations. In this 
example we will add 10-3 mole of the strong acid H2S04 per liter of solution 
although a similar approach to the problem could be taken if a strong base were 
added.

Two types of problems that often arise in conjunction with water 
treatment processes such as softening and water co,:,ditioning are: Is this 288 Precipitation and Dissolution 
solution saturated with respect to CaCO",,? If not, is it undersaturated or 
oversaturated and what doses of which chemicals must be added to a 
water to produce a treated water of specified composition (alkalinity, pH, 
hardness, and degree of saturation with respect to CaCO",)? 
The latler question is only addressed in an introductory fashion in this 
text, and the reader is referred to books on water treatment for a more 
detailed discussion of water conditioning. The use of diagrams such as 
the Arbatsky" and Caldwell-Lawrence" diagrams is common. More 
modern approaches utilize the computer to solve the equilibria involved 
in these problems. In water conditioning the water is treated as a closed 
system with CaCO"" present, but the calculations may be somewhat in 
error because the system does not entirely behave as a closed system. 
The composition of the system is computed prior to chemical dosing, 
chemicals (e.g., acid, base, CO" and alkalinity) are added, and the 
composition of the system is computed following chemical addition­
again assuming a closed system. 
The determination of whether a solution is in equilibrium with CaCO"" 
can be accomplished by calculating the free energy of the solution as 
described in Chapter 3. 
Example 6-17 
Water of the following composition is obtained following a softeninglrecarbon. 
alion process: [CaH] = I X 10-', [HCO,-] = 2 x 10-', pH = 8.7, temperature =

The Langelier Index The problem of determining whether or not a water 
is in equilibrium with CaC0 3{,) can be approached by determining 
whether the so·called Langelier Index (L.I.) (or Saturation Index, S.I.) is 
positive or negative. The L.1. is defined as the difference between the 
actual (or measured) pH of a water and the hypothetical pH the water 
would have if it were in equilibrium with CaCO,{,)." 
L.1. ~ pH, -pH, (6·38)

the activity coefficients.

Am. Water Works Assoc .. 28: 1500 (1939). 
17 Some determine pH, by using the total alkalinity in place of the [HCO,-} 
concentration in the existing water. However, this leads to a reversal in sign 
for L.r. at pH > pKa.2• i.e .. precipitation occurs if the L.!. < 0. instead of 
precipitation occurring if pH > 0 as is true at pH < pKa•2• (See R. E. Lowenthal 
and C. V. R. Marais, Carbonate Chemistry of Aquatic Systems: Theory and 
Application, Ann Arbor Science Publishers, 1976.) Defining pHs as presented 
above avoids this problem. In the pH range normally encountered. the two 
approaches are essentially the same, since total alkalinity (eqlliter) ~ [HC03-}. 290 Precipitation and Dissolution 
If a water has a L.I. of zero, it is in equilibrium with CaCO",,; if the L.I. 
i,s a positive value, the water is oversaturated with respect to CaC0 3(S) 
and will tend to precipitate CaCO",); and if the L.I. is a negative value, 
the water is undersaturated with respect to CaCO",) and will tend to 
dissolve CaCO",). 
The expression for the value of pH, is derived from the equilibrium 
constant of the equation, 
K '0 {Ca2+ }{HCO, -) 
K,.2 {H+) K = Kso 
Ka,2 
'Ye,H[Ca2+] 'YHeo,-[HCO, -] 
{W) 
log {H+) = log K,.2 -log K,o + log [Ca2+] 
+ log [HCO, -] + log 'Ye,H + log 'YHeo,-
or 
pH, = pK'.2 -pK,o + p[Ca2+] + p[HCO,-] -log 'Ye,H -log 'YHeo,- (6-39) 
The total alkalinity in eq/liter can be used interchangeably with [HCO,-] 
for waters with pH < 9. When calcium complexes make up a significant 
portion of the total calcium concentration, the concentration of these 
complexes must be substracted from the total calcium to yield [Ca2+]. 
Also, if species such as aqueous silica contribute to the total alkalinity 
(see Section 4.13.5) the portion of the total alkalinity attributable to these 
species must be subtracted from the total alkalinity; the difference is then 
used to calculate the HCO, -concentration. 
Using the constants, the measured values of [Ca2+] and [HCO, -] and 
the values of the activity coefficients as given in Example 6-17, we can 
solve for pH, thus: 
pH, = 10.49 -8.15 + 3 + 2.7 + 0.12 + 0.03 = 8.19 
Therefore, 
L.I. = pH, -pH, = 8.7 -8.09 = +0.61 
The L.I. is positive, so the water is "encrustive" and will tend to 
precipitate CaCO"". 
The two procedures for assessing the state of a water with respect to 
CaCO",) are identical. This is shown as follows: Consider the reaction 
CaCO",) + H+ :0= Ca2+ + HCO,-
K = {Ca2+}{HCO,-)

where l ] and { } denote equilibrium concentration and activity and [ ], 
and { }, denote actual or measured concentrations or activity. 
Now 
Q _ 'Yc,H'YHco,-[Ca2+],[HC0 3 -],{H+} 
K -'Yc,H'YHco,-[CaH][HC0 3 j{H+}. 
From the definition of pH, given above, 
[CaH], = [CaH] 
and 
then 
Since 
We have 
From Eq. 3·23, [HC03 oj, = [HC03-] 
pH, = -log {W} 
pH, = -log {W}, 
Q log K = pH, -pH, = L.r. 
Q tJ.G = 2.3RT log K = 2.3RT (L.I.) 
Thus a positive tJ.G corresponds to a positive L.r. (6·40) 
The question of whether a water is oversaturated, undersaturated, or 
in equilibrium with calcium carbonate is important in the water industry, 
where processes called water conditioning are used to adjust the state of 
CaCO"" saturation. The importance of the CaCO"" saturation condition 
of a water relates to its behavior during transport, for example, in 
distribution systems and conduits and to some extent to its behavior 
during granular media filtration. Waters grossly oversaturated with 
CaC0 3 will tend to lay down precipitates of CaCO"" on the interior of the 
pipe, reducing its carrying capacity and in extreme cases blocking the 
pipe altogether (Fig. 6-14). Waters grossly undersaturated with respect to 
CaC0 3 tend to dissolve the protective CaC0 3(" coatings of transmission 
lines and are often classified as being "corrosive." Generally, an attempt 
is made in practice to maintain the L.r. slightly positive, although in 
some areas of the United States and Europe a slightly negative or zero 
value is used. If the water is supersaturated, it is desirable to know how 292 Precipitation and Dissolution 
Fig. 6-14. Water distribution conduit virtually blocked with precipitated GaC0 3. 
Courtesy of R. R. TrusselL J. M. Montgomery Engineers. Pasadena, Calif. 
much CaCO"" will precipitate or dissolve. The L.r. has limited application 
because it tells us only whether precipitation or dissolution, if any, will 
tend to take place. Indeed, a water with a L.r. of 0.3 and a high buffer 
intensity may precipitate more CaCO",) than one that has L.r. of 0.5 and 
a low buffer intensity. 
Precipitation Potential We can calculate the amount of CaCO"" that 
will precipitate or dissolve as the water equilibrates by applying the two 
following principles to calculate equilibrium concentrations: 
I. Total acidity does not change as CaCO"" precipitates or dissolves. 
2. Total alkalinity (eqiliter) -calcium (eqiliter) = constant, as precip. 
itation or dissolution takes place. 
The total acidity does not change because CO,'-does not enter into the 
equation for it, that is, 
Total acidity = 2[H,CO;] + [HC0 3 -] + [H+] -[OH-] Calcium Carbonate Solubility and Water Stability 293 
This is analogous to the lact that the addition or elimination 01 CO, does 
not alter the total alkalinity if it does not cause CaCO"" to precipitate or 
dissolve. The total alkalinity, defined as 
Total alkalinity = 2[CO,'-] + [HCO, -] + [OH-] -[W] 
changes as CaCO"" precipitates or dissolves but total alkalinity (eq/liter) 
-Ca'+ (eqlliter) does not change because the number 01 eq/liter 01 Ca2+ 
removed or added via CaCO"" precipitation or dissolution is equal to the 
eqlliter 01 total alkalinity removed or added. The calculation procedure 
is illustrated in the lollowing example. 
Example 6-18 
Calculate the amount of CaC0 3{S1' in eq/liter and mg/liter as eaC03, which will 
precipitate as the solution in Example 6-17 is equilibrated. Neglect ionic strength 
effects in this calculation. 
Solution 
The system is assumed to 'be closed so no CO2 can enter or leave. 
The unknown concentrations after equilibration are [H,CO;], [HCO, -], [CO,'-], 
[H+), [OH-]. [eaH], ander,co3' Thus seven equations are needed to determine the 
equilibrium concentrations. 
From Example 6-17, before precipitation, we know [Ca2+]ori9 = 1 X 10-3, pH = 
8.7, and [HCO,-] = 2 x 10-'. At 10°C, K,.l = 10-6.", K,., = 10-10.", K,o = 10-•. 15 (from 
Table 4-7) and Kw = 10-14.5 (interpolating from Table 4-2), Using Ka•1 and Ka,2, we 
calculate [H,CO;] = 1.1 x 10-' and [CO,'-] = 3.2 x 10-'. Using these values in the 
equation for total acidity given above, we find total acidity = 2.02 x 10-3 eqlliter. 
Also. total alkalinity (= 2.07 x 10-' eqlliter) -Cao. (= 2 x 10-3 eqlliter) = 0.07 x 
10-' eqlliter. 
After the solution equilibrates we can calculate the equilibrium concentrations 
knowing that total acidity and [total alkalinity -Ca" (eqlliter)] does not change. 
The equations we need are 
(1) Total acidity = 2[H,CO;] + [HCO, -] + [W] -[OW] = 2.02 x 10-' eqlliter 
(2) Total alkalinity -Cao. (eqlliter) = 2[CO,'-] + [HCO, -] + [OW] -[W] -
2[Ca2+] = 7 x 10-' 
[W][HCO,-] 
(3) K,.l = [H,CO;] 
[H+][CO,'-] 
(4) K ,., = [HCO,] 
(5) C,.co,= [H,CO;] + [HCO,-] + [CO,'-] 
(6) Kw = [W][OW] 
(7) K ~ = [Ca2+][CO,'-] 
To solve, substitute into equation (2) to obtain one equation with one unknown, 
[H+], and solve by trial and error, just as was done in Examples 6-14, 6-15, and 294 Precipitation and Dissolution 
6-16. Remembering ao = [H2CO;VC T,C03' al = [HC03~]/CT,COJ' and a2 = 
iCO,'-]lC T.CO,' The result from combining equations (3), (4) and (5) and using 
equation (7) to obtain [ea2+] =Kso/(a2CT.COJ) and substituting into equation (2) is

We can solve equations (8) and (9) by assuming [H+], obtaining a values from 
Appendix 1. calculatingC T.co3 from equation (9), and then determining if equation 
(8) is satisfied. If not, a new value of [H+] is assumed. We can simplify the 
procedure somewhat in this case by assuming [H+1 and K w/[H+] to be small 
relative to the other terms in equations (8) and (9). Using this approach, we find 
[H+] ~ 10-•. 08• From equation (7), [CaH] ~ 9.48 X 10-' M. 
Subtracting the [Ca'+] at equilibrium from the [CaH] originally present yields 
the Ca2+, and thus the CaC03(s)' which precipitates per liter of solution.

The theoretical precipitation potential of CaC03{,' found in Example 6-
18 was 5.2 mg/liter, which is within the range of 4 to 10 mglliter suggested 
for a well-conditioned water by Merrill and Sanks." A similar approach 
to that given in Example 6-18 can be used to determine the concentrations 
of conditioning chemicals to add if they are needed. Such calculations, 
as well as calculation of the precipitation potential, are facilitated by the 
use of diagrams such as the Caldwell-Lawrence diagrams; use of these 
diagrams is discussed by Merrill and Sanks. Water with the desired 
precipitation potential is thought to provide a thin protective coating of 
CaCO"" on the inside of distribution lines and so aid in preventing their 
deterioration by corrosion. The' most effective CaC03{,' layers appear to 
be those associated with iron hydroxide and iron carbonate precipitates. 19 
A slight supersaturation with CaC03{" and high alkalinity also provides 
the water with pH buffering capacity against CO, generated in the 
distribution systems, by slime growths for example, and prevents corro­
sion by preventing low pH values from occurring (see Section 7-6 for a 
discussion of the effect of pH on corrosion). Waters that have a low 
calcium concentration and a low alkalinity, and thus a low buffer

these conditions; Stumm found that when a high pH was necessary to 
create a positive L.l., scale formation was not uniform. 21

or 
9 X 10-6 X 10' mg/mole = 0.9 mg/liter as CaCO, 
This example provides a further illustration of the way in which com­
plexation increases the solubility of sparingly soluble solids. The curves 
in Fig. 6-15 show that the consideration of calcium complexes becomes 
significant in determining calcium solubility at pH values above 9. 
The solubility of calcium is affected by the SO.'-complex, and mag­
nesium solubility is affected by OH-, CO,'-, HC0 3-, and SO.'-complex 
formation: 
CaSO,' ¢ Ca'+ + SO.'-; log Kd = -2.31 
MgCO,' ¢ Mg'+ + CO,'-; log K d = -3.4 
MgOW ¢ Mg'+ + OH-; log K d = -2.6 
MgHCO,-¢ Mg'+ + HC03-; logKd= -1.2 
MgSO,'¢Mg2++S0.'-; logKd=-2.36 
The consideration of complex formation by both Ca2+ and Mg'+ is of 
significance in determining the lowest achievable residual hardness by 
the lime-soda water-softening process. Complexes of Ca2+ and Mg'+ are 
weak enough to be titrated by EDTA, that is, EDTA can break these 
complexes, in the commonly used, complexometric, titration analytical 
procedure and so will register as residual hardness. The presence of 
complexes may require that a higher value of L.I. be used to produce a 
noncorrosive water. assuming that the concentrations of complexes are 
not taken into account when the L.I. is calculated. For example, at pH 9, 
the presence of 200 mg SOl-fliter will increase the solubility of CaCO"" 
from I X 10-' M to 1.4 X 10-' M when Cr.co, = I X 10-3 M. When calculating 
the L.I .. the concentrations of calcium complexes should be subtracted 
from the total calcium concentration to yield the Ca'+ concentration. This 
value can then be used directly in the L.I. equation, Eq. 6·39. 
6.S. PHOSPHATE CHEMISTRY 
6.S.1. Reactions of Phosphates 
The chemistry of phosphates as relevant to aquatic systems is discussed 
as an example of the importance of heterogeneous equilibria in waters. 
Phosphorus, present as various forms of phosphate, is of central concern 
to a wide variety of biological and chemical processes in natural waters, 
wastewater, and water treatment. Phosphate is a nutrient required for 
the growth of all living protoplasm that. contains approximately 2 percent 
phosphorus on a dry weight basis. ·As such, phosphorus can be the Phosphate Chemistry 299 
element'in short supply that limits the growth~ of photosynthetic aquatic 
plants. Phosphate is used as a nutrient by organisms in biological waste 
treatment processes. Phosphates are used in industrial water-softening 
processes, where their ability to form sparingly soluble calcium salts is 
capitalized upon. Also, condensed phosphates are employed as agents 
for complexing CaN and Fe'+ in boiler waters, as "threshold treatment 
agents" (e.g .. the use of sodium tripolyphosphate which adsorbs on the 
surface of calcite crystallites and thus prevents CaCO",) precipitation) 
and as builders in synthetic detergent formulations (where tripolyphos­
phate stabilizes dirt particles, and complexes Ca2+ and Mg2+ to prevent 
them from combining with the detergent molecule). 
Several of the more common classes of phosphorus-containing com­
pounds are presented in Table 6-3. In the orthophosphate anion, the P 
atom is centrally bonded to the oxygen atoms, which are located at the 
corners of a tetrahedron. The condensed phosphates-the polyphosphates 
and metaphosphates-are formed by the condensation of two or more 
orthophosphate groups and have the characteristic P-O-P linkage. 
While polyphosphates are .linear molecules, the metaphosphates are 
cyclic. 
Typical concentrations of phosphates found in various waters are given 
in Table 6-4. In fresh raw domestic wastewater the phosphate is distributed 
approximately as follows: orthophosphate, 5 mglliter as phosphorus, 
tripolyphosphate, 3 mglliter as phosphorus, pyrophosphate, I mg/liter as 
phosphorus and organic phosphates < I mglliter as phosphorus. Second­
ary biological treatment, and indeed prolonged coniact with the micro­
organisms in raw sewage, ensures the hydrolysis, ("reversion") of con­
densed phosphates to orthophosphate. Tripolyphosphate, for example, 
hydrolyzes as follows: 
HP301O'-+ 2H,O ;;=: 3HPOj-+ 2H+ 
Hydrolysis is catalyzed by H+. Examination of Fig. 2-8 shows that at 10°C 
the time for 5 percent hydrolysis of a pyrophosphate solution at pH 4 is 
about I year; at pH 7 is many years and at pH 10 is over a century! Of 
course, catalysis of the hydrolysis reaction by enzymes is important in 
nonsterile natural waters. Wastewater effluent and natural waters contain 
significant amounts of organically bound phosphate. Indeed, some esti­
mates of the phosphate content of natural waters assign between 30 to 
60 percent of the total phosphate to the organically bound category. 
Phosphate solubility equilibrium constants and complexation equilib­
rium constants are given in Table 6-5. 
The behavior of calcium phosphate precipitates in dilute aqueous 
solutions serves to illustrate some of the difficulties that one may face 
when attempting to apply equilibrium calculations to predict solution 
concentrations of ions in contact with a solid. The calcium phosphate 
system by itself is very complex. From Table 6-5 it can be learned that 300 Precipitation and Dissolution

Therefore, we might deduce that if natural waters were in equilibrium 
with hydroxyapatite, or stated another way "if the orthophosphate con­
centration of natural waters was controlled by hydroxyapatite," we would 
not be much concerned with problems of algal growth associated with 
phosphorus. We would also encounter remarkable success if we were to 
precipitate phosphate from wastewater by adding calcium salts such as 
lime. Because we know that phosphate levels in wastewater. treated with 
calcium salts and in natural waters far exceed the calculated equilibrium 
value, we might deduce that hydroxyapatite does not control the ortho­
phosphate level. What then is happening? While the entire answer to 
this question is beyond the scope of this text. some facets of the system 
can be explored to illustrate the practical consequences of the previous 
discussion in this chapter on precipitate formation by nucleation, phase 
transformation, and crystal growth. A general picture of the nature of 
calcium phosphate precipitation is provided by Fig. 6-16. 
In a supersaturated solution there is at first a period of time before any 
decrease in dissolved phosphate takes place. This so-called induction 
period represents the time for nuclei to form. Ferguson et al.1O showed

that if a crystal seed of precipitated calcium phosphate were added to a 
solution supersaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite, there was a 
virtual elimination of the induction period as the precipitate acted as a 
nucleus for further precipitation as shown in Fig. 6·17. 
Following nucleation the formation of an amorphous precipitate occurs. 
The term amorphous refers to a solid that does not have a well-organized 
crystal structure and is almost always more soluble than the correspond­
ing crystalline solid. The amorphous nature of calcium phosphate pre­
cipitates may indeed be an important reason why phosphate solution 
concentrations are present in natural waters at higher levels than 
predicted by equilibrium with the crystalline solid. For the example of 
calcium phosphate precipitation given, we can see that precipitation not 
only results in an amorphous solid but also a precipitate whose solubility 
is greater than the thermodynamically stable phase. Such a solid is not 
stable and will transform, albeit slowly, to the stable solid phase. 
However, the first-formed solid may be stable enough to control solution 
phosphate concentrations in a pseudo-equilibrium or steady state situa­
tion. An example of such a system is provided by the work of Menar and 
Jenkins," who found that, in the presence of magnesium ion, the residual 
phosphate concentration in wastewater after treatment with calcium salts

could be described by an equilibrium between it and the solid phase (3-
tricalcium phosphate, (3-Caj,POJ" with a solubility product of 10-24• Let 
us compare two systems at pH 8 and [Ca2+] = 1.5 X 10-' M, one in 
equilibrium with hydroxyapatite and the second with (3-tricalcium phos­
phate. 
From previously, for phosphate in equilibrium with hydroxyapatite, 
POt-= 3.7 X 10-5 ILgiliter as phosphorus 
For (3-tricalcium phosphate, 
[Ca2+J'[POt-]' = 10-24 
( 10-24 ) 1/' 
[PO,'-] = (1.5 x 10-')' = 1.6 x 10-8 M 
or 
PO,'-= 0.5 ILgiliter as phosphorus 
This shows that the system in equillbrium with the less soluble solid 
can contain four orders of magnitude less orthophosphate than the water 
in equilibrium with (3-tricalcium phosphate. 
A further factor important in the control of phosphate levels by calcium 
phosphate precipitation is the rate of crystal growth. Ferguson et al.12 
showed that a rate law of the form 
dC = -kS(C -C)" 
dt 
was applicable for post induction periods, or where an induction period 
was absent, 
where 
n = order of reaction 
S = available crystal surface area 
C = concentration of phosphate, the limiting reactant 
C* = equilibrium concentration 
t = time from the end of the induction period 
k = a constant 
Since for hydroxyapatite, C· is very low, we can assume it to be zero. 
Also, we can assume that S is a constant if a constqnt amount (excess) 
of seed particles of hydroxyapatite are present. Thus

By carrying out calcium phosphate precipitation in solutions containing 
various levels of carbonate. CT,C03' which was shown to affect precipita­
tion, an empirical rate expression was determined as follows: 
where C and CT.co, are in units of millimoleslliter and t is in hours. The 
form of this rate equation has important practical implications for phos­
phate removal by calcium phosphate precipitation at slightly alkaline pH 
values. In addition to being an inverse function of the alkalinity (CT.co), 
the rate and extent of calcium phosphate precipitation are strongly 
dependent on reactor configuration, Reaclors that feature a recycle stream 
are far more efficient than equivalent reactors that do not because of the 
presence of much larger surface area of preformed precipitate contributed 
by the recycled stream, The concentration exponent of 2.7 tells us that the 
rate is extremely sensitive to concentration. Thus reactors that have 
regions of high concentration will have precipitation rates greater than 
equivalent reactors that. are mixed throughout. Plug-flow reactors are 
therefore more efficient than CSTR (completely stirred tank reactors). 
These features are illustrated by Fig. 6-18, which shows the predicled

6.8.2. Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate Precipitation 
The conditional solubility product of magnesium ammonium phosphate. 
struvite (MgNH,PO",,) illustrates a situation where more than one of the 
dissolving species is affected by solution pH. These species are the 
ammonium ion (NH,+) and the phosphate ion (PO,'-). Because an increase 
in pH will decrease the ammonium ion concentration and increase the 
phosphate ion concentration, it follows that there should be a pH value 
where the solubility of MgNH,P04[" is a minimum, that is, the pH where 
the product [Mg2+][NH,+j[pO,'-j is a minimum. Where is this point? 
We can attack this problem by writing equations for the pH.dependent 
reactions involving each of the species in the precipitate. Thus

the solubility product of MgNH,P04[,' as

where CT.M9, CT.NH" and CT.PQ,are the total analytical concentrations of 
magnesium, ammonia nitrogen, and orthophosphate, respectively. We 
can define the conditional solubility product as 
Then P, is a function of pH and its minimum value will occur when the 
product (aMgH) x (aNH,+) x (apo.'-)is a maximum. The values of these 
ionization fractions are presented in Appendix I; P, is plotted as a function 
of pH in Fig. 6-19, assuming in one case that I-' = 0 and in the other that 
I-' = 0.1. Activity coefficients were obtained from Fig. 3-4. We can see

Magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitation is a recognized prob­
lem in anaerobic sludge digesters, where it precipitates in digester 
supernatant recycle lines,. especially at elbows and on the suction side 
of pumps. This happens at these locations because they are regions of 
reduced pressure and CO, is released from solution. This causes a rise 
in pH of the digester supernatant with an accompanying increase in the 
product [Mg2+][NH, +][PO,'-] to values where K,g is exceeded. Figure 6-20 
is an illustration of a severe case of magnesium ammonium phosphate 
(struvite) deposition. This photograph was taken from a digestor recycle 
line at the City of Los Angeles Hyperion plant and shows that the cross 
section of a 14-in. pipe has been reduced to less than 4 in. by struvite 
precipitation. Similar accumulation of struvite blocked the screens 
through which digested sludge was passed prior to discharge to the 
ocean. Because the Hyperion plant discharges both digested sludge and 
sewage effluent to the ocean, the solution to this problem was to dilute 
the digested sludge with effluent in a volume ratio of about 3: I. Let us 
examine the basis for this solution to the problem. Figure 6-21 shows the 
flow sheet of the wastewater treatment plant. Table 6-6 presents the 
concentrations of ammonia, orthophosphate, and magnesium and the pH 
of the raw sludge, digested sludge, and diluted digested sludge. 
With the concentrations indicated in Table 6-6 we can compute the 
product CT,M9 x CT,NH, X CT,PQ, and if this significantly exceeds the 
conditional solubility product. P" then struvite should precipitate.

the diluted digested sludge is supersaturated with respect to struvite but 
not the same degree as the digested sludge. If P, is corrected for activity, Raw sewage

assuming /L = O.L P, = 10-6.1 so that the solution is actually undersatur· 
ated. 
Thus the dilution provided appears to be adequate to prevent struvite 
precipitation. The solution to the problem is soundly based. The solution 
to this problem at the Hyperion plant represents something of a luxury 
because there are not many plants that have the ability to dilute digester 
supernatant with secondary effluent and then discharge the mixture. One 
such example is the Oakland, California, treatment plant of the East Bay 
Municipal Utility District. At this plant a MgNH 4PO"" scaling problem 
developed. Dilution to below P, was not feasible; handling digester 
supernatant to keep CO, in solution (and therefore keep pH depressed) 
was not practicable. The solution to the scaling problem was to add a 
material that inhibited crystal formation (a polyacrylamide crystal inhib· 
itor (Cyanamer P-70, American Cyanamid Corporation) at doses of 10 to 
20 mglliter). Such solutions to scaling problems are not as "safe and sure" 
as reducing the value of an ion product to below the solubility product of 
a scale·forming precipitate; however, they must be used when that

6.8.3. Iron Phosphate Precipitation from Wastewater 
The addition of aluminum salts (see Section 6.6.2) or iron salts to 
wastewater for phosphate removal results in the precipitation of alu· 
minum hydroxyphosphate (Alx{OH),{PO.,),) and ferric hydroxyphosphate 
(Fex{OH),{P0 4),), respectively. These solids are incorporated into the 
sludge or underflow solids streams that in a typical municipal treatment 
plant are treated by anaerobic digestion (see Fig. 6·21). When Fe{I1I) salts, 
for example, FeCI, and Fe,{S04)" are used as phosphate precipitants with 
the objective of removing phosphate, a question arises concerning the 
fate of this precipitate in the highly reducing conditions of the anaerobic 
digestion process. Under such conditions Fe{I1I) will be reduced to Fe{II)­
what then is the fate of the phosphate that has been precipitated with the 
Fe{I1I)? Does it remain in the solid phase or is it released to solution to be 
recycled back through the treatment plant in the digester supernatant 
stream? 
The early literature on the effect of iron and aluminum salt addition on 
phosphate concentrations in digester supernatant seemed to indicate that 
phosphate release was not occurring during digestion; rather, after metal 
salt addition phosphate levels in digester supernatants decreased. 
Singer" proposed that the reason for this was that the sparingly soluble 
ferrous phosphate, vivianite, was formed under the conditions of anaer· 
obic sludge digestion.

measurement. The experimental system is illustrated in Fig. 6·22. 
A constant ionic strength medium (a. I M NaCI04) was prepared to 
eliminate the need for activity corrections. Ferrous perchlorate Fe{CI04), 
and NaH,P04 were added to water through which nitrogen gas was 
bubbled to remove all traces of dissolved oxygen and so to produce 
reducing conditions. The pH of individual bottles was then adjusted with 
Na,CO, to several values in the pH range 4 to 8. After sealing, the bottles 
were stored for I month during which time a blue·white precipitate

REACTIONS 
7.1. INTRODUCTION 
Oxidation-reduction or "redox" reactions playa central role in many of 
the reactions occurring in natural waters and in water and wastewater 
treatment processes. The behavior of compounds containing carbon, 
nitrogen, sulfur, iron, and manganese in natural waters and treatment 
processes is largely influenced by redox reactions. Redox reactions are 
encountered in many of the analyses conducted on water and wastewater; 
for example, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and the chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) tests and the analysis of dissolved oxygen are 
based on them. Many of the chemicals employed in water and wastewater 
treatment processes are used to alter the chemical nature of water and 
wastewater constituents by oxidation-reduction processes, such as chlo­
rine, chlorine dioxide, permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, ozone, 
and sulfur dioxide. Oxidation-reduction reactions catalyzed by enzymes 
(microorganisms) form the basis for waste treatment processes like 
activated sludge, biological filtration, and anaerobic digestion. Such 
microbially mediated redox reactions are also significant in transforma­
tions of nutrients, metals, and other chemical species in natural waters. 
In this chapter we will examine oxidation-reduction stoichiometry, 
equilibria, and the graphical representation of simple and complex 
equilibria, and the rate of oxidation-reduction reactions. The applications 
of redox reactions to natural waters will be presented in the context of a 
discussion of iron chemistry; the subject of corrosion will provide a vehicle 
for a discussion of the application of electrochemical processes; a pres­
entation of chlorine chemistry will include a discussion of the kinetics of 
redox reactions and the reactions of chlorine with organic matter; finally, 
the application of redox reactions to various measurement methods will 
be discussed using electrochemical instruments as examples. 
7,2. REDOX STOICHIOMETRY 
The first step in solving any equilibrium problem is to determine the 
identity of the reactants and products and then to present them in a Redox Stoichiometry 317 
balanced chemical equation. In previous chapters we have seen how to 
do this for acid·base, complex, and heterogimeous equilibria using the 
principles of stoichiometry. In this section we will learn how to write a 
balanced chemical equation for an oxidation-reduction reaction. At the 
beginning we will not inquire whether such a reaction is possible (this 
question will be answered later in our discussion of the thermodynamics 
of redox systems). 
A redox reaction consists of two parts or half·reactions. These are the 
oxidation reaction in which a substance loses or donates electrons and 
the reduction reaction in which a substance gains or accepts electrons. 
An oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction must always be coupled 
because "free" electrons cannot exist in solution and electrons must be 
conserved. The coupling between the two half-reactions is by the electrons 
that are either generated (by oxidation) or consumed (by reduction). We 
will use this fact in our technique for balancing redox reactions, which 
basically is a stepwise stoichiometric (mass) balancing of each constituent 
followed by a balancing of charge (electroneutrality). 
Working with each half-reaction, we use the following procedure for 
balancing. . 
I. Identify the principal reactants and products, that is, species other 
than H+, OH-, and H20, in the oxidation half-reaction and the 
reduction half-reaction and write each half-reaction in crude form. 
2. Then to obtain balanced half-reactions, balance the atoms other 
than hydrogen and oxygen by multiplying the reactants or products 
by appropriate integers. 
3. Balance the oxygen using H20. 
4. Balance the hydrogen with H+. 
5. Balance the charge with electrons. 
6. Multiply each half-reaction by an appropriate integer so that both 
contain the same number of electrons. 
7. Add the two balanced half-reactions. 
8. Steps I to 7 will sometimes produce an equation that has H+ as a 
reactant or a product. If it is known that the reaction takes place in 
alkaline solution, add the reaction for dissociation of water to the 
balanced equation to eliminate H+ and form H20. 
Example 7-1 
Balance the reaction in which ferrous iron (Fe2+) is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe3+) 
by permanganate (Mn04-)' which itself is reduced to manganese dioxide (Mn02(S)' 
The reaction takes place in alkaline solution. 318 Oxidation·Reduction Reactions

2. The atoms oHier than Hand 0 are already balanced. 
3. Balance the oxygen with water.

eliminating electrons

The equation is now balanced. In some instances it may be desirable to 
modify it to take into account other reactions and to make it more useful. 
as shown in steps (7) and (8). 
7. The reaction takes place in alkaline solution. Add the water dissociation 
equation to eliminate H+ as a reactant, 
4H+ + 3Fe2+ + Mn04- :;;::":3Fe3+ + Mn02(s) +2HP 
4H,O "" 4H+ + 40H-
2H,O + 3FeH + MnO,-",,3Fe'+ + MnO"" +40H-
8. Further, we know that in alkaline solution, Fe3+ and OH-will combine to 
form Fe(OH)3(s)' Adding this reaction, we obtain the final equation. 
2H,O + 3Fe" + MnO, -"" 3Fe3+ + MnO"" + 40H-
3 x (Fe'+ + 30H-""Fe(OH)",J 
2H,O + 3Fe'+ + MnO,-+ 50H-""3Fe(OH)",, + MnO"" 
This last step would not have been necessary if in step (1) we had taken 
Fe(OHhiS) as the product rather than Fe3+. 
From this example we can see how a redox reaction is composed of the 
reduction half-reaction and the oxidation half-reaction. We note that 
ferrous iron is oxidized (it loses electrons) and permanganate is reduced Redox Stoichiometry 319 
(it gains electrons). Since the ferrous iron is donating electrons for the 
reduction of permanganate to MnO,(", it is called a reducing agent. 
Conversely, the permanganate, which accepts the electrons from the 
oxidation of ferrous iron, is called an oxidizing agent. We encounter these 
terms widely in water chemistry. For example, if you thumb quickly 
through Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 
you will discover statements such as "The chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) determination is a measure ... of the organic matter ... suscep­
tible to oxidation by a strong chemical oxidant." "D.O. (dissolved oxygen) 
rapidly oxidizes an equivalent amount of the dispersed divalent man­
ganese solution .... " "Ozone, a potent germicide, also is used as an 
oxidizing agent for the destruction of organic compounds ... and for the 
oxidation of reduced iron or manganese salts to insoluble oxides .... " 
Before we proceed further we should address one more aspect of 
stoichiometry and the balancing of reactions; that is, the question of 
equivalent weight (and normality) for oxidizing and reducing agents. One 
equivalent weight of an oxidizing or reducing agent is the formula weight 
divided by the number of electrons taking part in the half-reaction. For 
this reason, a knowledge of the specific half-reaction in which an oxidant 
or a reductant participates is needed to determine its equivalent weight 
and to make up a solution of desired normality. This is especially 
important for some oxidants and reductants that participate in different 
half-reactions depending on solution conditions such as pH. It should 
also be pointed out that the equivalent weight of a substance from an 
acid-base, charge, or precipitation standpoint bears no relationship to its 
equivalent weight in a redox system. 
Example 7-2 
A COD analysis is to be performed using 0.250 N potassium dichromate. How 
many grams of K ... Cr ... 07 must be added to 2 liters of water to prepare this solution? 
The product of oxidation is chromic ion (Cr3+) and the reaction takes place in acid 
solution. 
Solution 
First. we state the relevant reactant and product: 
CraOi- ~ Cr3+ 
Next, using the previously described technique. we balance the half-reaction. 
remembering that we are dealing with an acid solution. 
00-+ 14H+ + Cr,O,'- 0= 2CrJ+ + 7H,O 
Since there are 6e-in the half-reaction, tlle equivalent weight of K2Cr207 is its 
formula weight divided by 6. The formula weight of K,Cr,O, is 294.189. Thus 
Equivalent weight = 2946189 = 49.0315 320 Oxidation~Reduction Reactions 
For 2 liters of a 0.250 N solution we require 
0.250 eqlliter x 2 liter x 49.0315 g/eq = 24.516 g 
This checks nicely with the instructions given in Standard Methods for preparing 
0.250 N K,Cr,O,-the addition of 12.259 g of K,Cr,07 to I liter of water is stipulated. 
Example 7-3 
The United Kingdom Department of the Environment' proposes a test method 
for "permanganate value" in which a diluted waste is oxidized for 4 hours at 27°C 
by a dilute acidic solution of potassium permanganate. The reagents for this test 
include 0.125 N potassium permanganate, KMn04' The instructions for preparing 
this reagent call for the addition of 4.0 9 KMn04 to I liter distilled wqter. What 
is the rationale behind the recipe for this solution? 
Solution 
We must find what fraction of the formula weight of KMn04 corresponds to the 
situation that 4 glliter KMnO, = 0.125 eqlliter (i.e .. 0.125 N). 
Formula weight of KMnO, '" 158 
One eighth of the formula weight of KMnO, = 19.75. 
Thus, if there were one electron involved in the half~reaction, we would need 
to add 19.75 g (or approximately 20 g KMnO,) to I liter to make a 0.125 N solution. 
However, the instructions only call for 4 glliter. If we let x be the number of 
electrons involved in the half-reaction, then 
and x = 5. 
Searching the literature we find the reaction where permanganate forms 
manganous ion, 
MnO,' + 8H+ + Sa' "" Mn1+ + 4H,O 
This fits the bill, since it has Se-and it takes place in acid solution. 
Using the result of this computation, we can see that if the reaction from 
Example 7-1, 
MnO,' + 4W + 39' "" MnO",) + 2H,O 
in which Mn04 -has an equivalent weight of!, instead of!, of the formula weight, 
had been used to compute the normality of the permanganate solution, we would 
obtain a solution with an entirely different composition. This raises the question 
of expressing concentrations of standard solutions (especially those used in 
oxidation-reduction reactions) in terms of normality. Imagine the mental anguish 
experienced by the chemist confronted with a bottle labeled I N KMn04' How 
does he know which reaction the normality is based upon? He does not, unless 
he made it up himself and can remember how much KMn04 he put in the bottle 
or unless he knows for what reaction the KMn04 is intended. It is therefore poor

Environment, 1972, p. 125. Redox Stoichiometry 321 
practice to label bottles with "normality," If you lise molar concentrations or 
weight concentrations, there will be no confusion. 
The equivalent weights of oxidizing agents play an important practical 
role in water chemistry in the computation of the relative oxidizing 
capacity of various chlorine compounds. The strength of chlorine·con· 
taining disinfectants is often expressed in terms of "percent available 
chlorine," and incredible though it may seem, some of these agents have 
more than 100 percent available chlorine. The derivation of "percent 
available chlorine" is based on the half-reaction 
2e-+ CI"g, ;;=! 2CI-
in which chlorine gas is reduced to chlorine ions with the consumption 
of two electrons. In this equation the equivalent weight of chlorine is 2 
X 35.5/2 = 35.5 g. Stated another way, we can say that each unit of 
oxidizing power (Le., each mole of electrons consumed) is associated with 
35.5 g of CI,. 
Now let us consider another chlorine-containing oxidizing agent, for 
example, sodium hypochlorite, NaOCI. The half-reaction for NaOCI is 
2e-+ 2H+ + NaOCI ;;=! CI-+ Na+ + H,O 
In this reaction, each mole 'of electrons is associated with the formula 
weight of NaOCII2 = 37.25 g of CI,. 
For CI"g, we needed 35.5 g oxidizing agent to accept I mole of electrons; 
for NaOCI we need 37.25 g to do the job. Therefore, on an "electrons 
consumed per unit weight" basis, NaOCI is worse at consuming electrons 
than CI"g)' It is precisely, (35.5/37.25) X 100 = 95 percent as good as CI"g). 
We say that NaOCI has "95 percent available chlorine" meaning, on a 
weight-to-weight basis, NaOCI has 95 percent of the oxidizing power of 
C12{g)' 
Example 7-4 
What is the percent available chlorine in (I) monochloramine, NH,CI, and (2) 
high test hypochlorite, HTH, which is 70 percent by weight calcium hypochlorite, 
Ca(OCI)" given that the Cl in the NH,Cl and HTH is converted to CI-, and that 
the N in NH2Cl is converted to NH4 +? 
Solution

Half-reaction 
2e-+ 2H+ + NH,CI "" Cl-+ NH: 
Equivalent weight = formula weight of NH,C]f2 = 51.5/2 = 25.75 
Percent available chlorine = 35.5/25.75 x 100 = 138 pergent. 322 Oxidation·Reduction Reactions 
2. 70 percent Ca(OC!),. 
Half·reaction 
4e-+ 4W + Ca(OC!), ~ 2CI-+ Ca" + 2H,O 
Equivalent weight ~ formula weight of Ca(OC!),!4 ~ 143/4 ~ 35.75 
Percent available chlorine for Ca(OC!), ~ 35.5/35.75 x 100 ~ 99.3 percent. 
For 70 percent Ca(OC!), ~ 99.3 percent x 701100 ~ 69.5 percent. 
The unit mglliter as Cl2 is commonly used in the water treatment field. We use 
the concept of equivalents to convert from molar or mass concentration of a given 
chlorine species, such as HOCI. OCI-, NH2Cl, NHCl 2, to mass concentration as 
C12• One mole each of HOCI. OCI-, and NH2Cl can accept 2 moles of electrons, 
just as Cl2 can. The balanced half·reaction for NHCl 2 shows that it can accept 4 
moles of electrons. The reaction products for the NH2CI and NHCl 2 reactions are 
NH, and CI-. Thus I mole of HOC!. OCI-. or NH,CI is equivalent to I mole (71 g) 
of CI, while NHCI, is equivalent to 2 moles (142 g) of CI,. Thus knowing the 
balanced half·reaction for a species allows us to convert to "mg/liter as C12• II 
7.3. REDOX EQUILIBRIA 
7.3.1. Direction of Reaction 
In the previous section we learned how to balance redox reactions. 
However, once we had balanced the half-reactions and written a complete 
redox reaction we still did not know whether the reaction could proceed 
as written. In this section we will explore methods for making such a 
determination and in doing so will use many of the concepts and 
techniques developed in Chapter 3. 
To illustrate the situation, we will examine the redox reaction between 
potassium dichromate, K,Cr,O" and ferrous iron, Fe'+. This reaction is 
utilized in the titrimetric finish of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) 
test. The test consists of boiling a sample with a known amount of K,Cr,O, 
for 2 hours during which time some of the K,Cr,O, oxidizes the organic 
matter to CO, and water. Followi.ng this digestion, the excess dichromate 
must be measured. This is done by titrating with a standardized solution 
of ferrous ammonium sulfate (a source of ferrous ions) upon which the 
following reactions take place: 
6e -+ l4H+ + Cr,O,'-'" 2Cr'+ + 7H,O 
6 x (Fe'+ -> Fe'+ + e-) 
(7 -I) 
The dichromate is reduced to chromic ion while the ferrous ion is oxidized 
to ferric ion. When all of the Cr,O,'-has been reduced, it is possible for 
Fe2+ to exist in solution. An indicator called orthophenanthroline is added, 
which forms a red complex with Fe'+ and thereby detects the presence of Redox Equilibria 323 
free Fe2+. (Incidentally, for purely aesthetic reasons this is one of the 
more delightful titrations to observe. The orange color of Cr,O,'-changes 
through an olive intermediate hue to the deep green color of the chromic 
ion and then suddenly, just like a stoplight changing, the green turns to 
the red of the orthophenanthroline.Fe2+ complex.) 
If we were proposing, for the first time, to use Fe2+ as a reducing agent 
to determine the amount of Cr,O,'-in a solution, how could we be sure 
that the reaction would proceed as written in Eq. 7-1? The first approach 
would be to determine the standard free energy change, tlGo of the 
reaction as written and determine if it was negative. Remember that the 
more negative the tlGo value, the larger the equilibrium constant, K.

tlGo = -77.8 
and since 
tlGo = -RTlnK 
K = 10"" 
K is certainly large and the reaction should be displaced far to the right 
at equilibrium. 
Neglecting ionic strength effects, we assume that the titration has 
proceeded a little way and that the reactant concentrations are [Fe'+] = 
10-', [Fe'+] = 10-4, [Cr'+] = 10-,·4, [Cr,O,'-] = 10-'" and [H+] = 10+1.,. 
(These are realistic concentrations for the situation that exists in an 
actual COD titration.) Calculating the reaction quotient, Q, as follows, 
Q = [Fe2+]6[Cr,O,'-][H+]" 
(10-')'( I 0-'.4)' 
(I 0-4)6( I 0-" ')( I 0"')" 10-14., 324 Oxidation·Reduction Reactions 
we can use Eq. 3·10 to calculate t.G at 25'C, 
t.G = t.G' + RT lnQ 
t.G = -77.8 + RT In 10-14.3 
= -97.2 
Thus the reaction is spontaneous to the right. 
7.3.2. Free Energy and Potential 01 Hall-Reactions 
Our calculation has involved the overall redox reaction and thus far we 
have done nothing different from our previous thermodynamic treatment 
of other types of equilibria. For the sake of convenience it would be 
profitable to be able to examine any two half-reactions and judge from 
them independently, in which direction a reaction could proceed spon­
taneously if they were combined. 
One way to do this is to determine the t.G' values for each half-reaction 
and then add them to determine the value of t.G' for the complete redox 
reaction. Let us examine one of the steps of the Winkler method for 
determining dissolved oxygen (DO) as an example of this technique. The 
last step of the Winkler method is the titration of iodine (I~,qJ to iodide 
(1-) using thiosulfate, 8,0,'-, which is itself oxidized to tetrathionate, 
8.0,'-. The reaction takes place in acid solution. The two half-reactions 
are

(7-3) 
In both of these equations we need to know the value of the free energy 
of formation of the electron t.Gl.,-. Thinking one step ahead to the addition 
o~Eqs. 7-2 and 7-3 to produce overall redox equation, we can see that 
t.Gl.,-will cancel out so that it does not really matter what value t.Gl.,­
has. By convention, however, t.Gl.,-is assigned a value of zero and this 
assignment permits us to examine half-reactions independent of the 
overall reaction.2 
2 With e-we have a situation quite similar to the proton, H+. Free electrons, 
similarly to free protons, do not exist in solution for a significant period of time. 
The proton is always attached to some molecule or ion in solution as is the 
electron. However, it is often useful to consider e-as a separate entity such as 
in a half·reaction just as we did for the proton in acid·base equilibria. From Table 3·1.

tlGo = 2( -12.35) -(+3.93) -2(0) = -28.63 
and for Eq. 7·3, 
tlGo = -246.3 + 2(0) -2(-127.2) = +8.1 
Therefore, for the overall reaction, 
tlGo = -28.63 + 8.1 -20.53 kcal 
Thus the reaction, 
I",q) + 28,0,'-"" 840,'-+ 21-
is spontaneous when all spec;ies are at unit activity, that is, when Q 
I. The electrons generated in the oxidation of 2S,0,'-to 840,'-drive the 
reduction of 12(aq) to 2I-. 
In a well·mixed solution such as exists during the titration of I",q) with 
8,0,'-, all of the participating species are in close contact with each 
other. The electron transfer takes place between species in intimate 
contact all throughout the solution. Imagine, however, if we were able to 
isolate the oxidation half·reaction and the reduction half·reaction into 
two separate containers. We then introduce a piece of platinum wire into 
both containers and connect the platinum wires externally from the 
solutions through a high.resistance voltmeter. We also ensure that there 
is connection between the two solutions so that ions formed in one 
container can eventually move to the other container and so maintain 
electroneutrality in the solutions. Without ion movement between the 
compartments, a transfer of e-through the platinum wire could be 
accompanied by a buildup of negative charges in one compartment and 
positive charge in the other. Because this would violate the electroneu· 
trality requirements, the reaction would not proceed. The system is 
illustrated in Fig. 7·1. 
As soon as we connect the platinum wires, the voltmeter will register 
a voltage reading showing (I) that a difference in potential exists between 
the two electrodes, and (2) that electrons are flowing in the external circuit 
between the two compartments, assuming that the reactions in question 
can take place on the platinum surface; We have formed a galvanic cell 326 Oxidation·Reduction Reactions

in which the chemical energy of the redox reaction is converted into 
electrical energy. We call the potential that develops the electromotive 
force (emf) of the cell; if all species are present at unit activity, the 
temperature is 25'C, and the pressure is I atm, we assign it a symbol of 
Eg,,,. The cell emf for these conditions is the electrochemical version of 
~G' for the reaction. Since it is not necesary for the reaction to take place 
in a cell, the symbol E' is often used in place of E;,,, and is identical to 
it. Like ~G', the redox potential can be split up into two parts, one for the 
oxidation half-reaction and one for the reduction half-reaction: 
E~ell = E~x + E~ed 
where E~, and E:,d are, respectively, the half-reaction potentials for the 
oxidation half-reaction and the reduction half-reaction. 
The E' values for various half-cells, like the ~Gf' values for various 
species, cannot be determined absolutely. Like ~G,' values they are 
measured with reference to a particular half-reaction that is assigned an 
E' value of zero at 25'C and I atm. This reaction is the reduction of 
hydrogen ion to hydrogen gas: 
E' = 0 (7-4) 
This convention is consistent with the assignment of ~Gf = 0 for H2(g) and 
H+, since we have previously stated that ~Gf.,-= O. E' is related to ~G', 
and E is related to ~G, by

Therefore, 
Note that the half-reaction of interest is written as a reduction reaction 
[I"", accepts electrons 1 and that the reaction at the hydrogen electrode 
is an oxidation reaction. Under these conditions the value ofEJ,r is called 
the standard electrode potential and has the same sign as the emf of the 
cell of which it is a component. If EO for the reaction in Eq. 7-6 is positive 
and all activities are unity, the reaction will proceed spontaneously as 
written because AGO, and thus AG, for the reaction is negative. If EO is 
negative, the reverse reaction will occur spontaneously. The convention 
for defining the standard electrode potential value as EO for the reduction 
half-reaction was adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied 
Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1953, and we will use it throughout this text.' Table

4 Not all texts use the IUPAC convention so that caution must be exercised in 
using values of EO taken from tables. Notably, the extensive presentation of 
half-reaction potentials in Oxidation Potentials, 2nd ed., by W. M. Latimer 
(Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J" 1952) employs a convention that is 
exactly opposite to that used here; i.e., the half·reaction is written as an 
oxidation rather than a reduction, and the EO value has a sign opposite to the 
standard reduction potential. In other textbooks, the EO value for the reduction 
half-reaction has a sign opposite to the standard electrode potential so that AG 
~ nFE. 330 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions 
For the I",q,/I-half-reaction the standard electrode potential, EO, is 
-+0.62 volts. This means that the reaction in Eq. 7 -6 will proceed spontan­
eously as written if all reactants and products are at unit activity, and 
that 12(aq) has a greater affinity for electrons than H+, that is, 12{aq) is a 
better oxidizing agent than H+. In the terminology of the corrosion chemist 
we would say that I",q, is more "noble" than H+. 
We can make a similar series of statements labout 1-. The positive EO 
value tells us that 1-has less tendency to donate electrons than H"", that 
is, it is a weaker reducing agent than H2{911 or it is less noble than H2(g)' 
The standard electrode potential for the S,O,'-/S,03'- half-reaction is 
EO = +0.18 volts. Because EO is positive, the overall reaction 
S40da~) + !H2(9);;::'!: 2S20:la~) + H~q) 
can proceed spontaneously as written when all reactants and products 
are at unit activity. 
7,3,3. Combination of Half-Reactions 
We can now combine the two -half-reactions (Eqs. 7-2 and 7-3) and 
determine the value of nfE~,,, for the cell in Fig. 7-1 from the two nfEo 
values for the half-reactions. This is exactly equivalent to adding ",Go 
values for the half-reactions. For example, using the values of ",Go 
previously determined, 
121aq) + 2e ----? 21-
2S,03'- -i> S,O,'-+ 2e-",G°(kcal) 
-28.63 
+ 8.1 
-20.53 
Since -2fE~,,, = -2f(0.44), E~,,, = 0.44 volts. -nfEO 
-2f(+0.62) 
-2F( -0.18) 
-2F(+0.44) 
Note that the value of EO is independent of reaction stoichiometry, that 
is, the number of electrons involved in the reaction. Thus if the reaction 
had been written H",q, + S,O,'c -i> 1-+ ts,o,'-, the value of EO would still 
be +0.44. However, the value of ",Go would change, since ",Go = -nfEO 
and n = 1 rather than n = 2. 
In this example and in the previous computations with the cell involving 
the standard hydrogen electrode, we added the EO values for the half­
reactions to obtain the E~,,, values. This is only possible because the nf 
component of the term -nfEo was identical for both half-reactions; that 
is, the same number of electrons were involved in each half-reaction. 
This will always be the case when two half-reactions are added to give 
an overall reaction because the equations must be added so that the 
electrons cancel. The addition of EO values for half-reactions is not always 
correct, however. For example, when we compose a new half-reaction by 
adding two half-reactions, the EO value of the new half-reaction may only Redox Equilibria 331 
be computed by the summation of t.G" (~ -nFE") values. In all instances 
-nFEo values are additive. .

7.3.4. The Nernst Equation 
Thus for we have confined 'our discussion to cells and half-reactions at 
standard state, that is, 25"C, I atm pressure. and unit activity for all 
species. To determine the effect of reactant and product concentrqtion, 
we need to draw further on our analogy between free energy change and 
electrode potential or cell emf. Using the free energy equation as 
developed in Chapter 3, 
t.G ~ t.G" +RTlnQ 
and dividing each term in the equation by -nF, we obtain 
t.G ~ t.G" + RT InQ 
-nF -nF -nF 
Substituting from Eq. 7-5 yields 
E~E"_RTlnQ 
nF 
which is the Nernst equation. In simplified form it is, 
E -E" 0.059 I Q ----og n (7-7) 
(7-8) 
at 25"C, since the term 2.3 RTIF has the value of 0.059. E is the cell 
potential and is a function of the reaction quotient, Q. From Eq. 7-5 we 
see that E has the opposite sign to t.G; thus if t.G is negative, E is positive 332 Oxidation.Reduction Reactions 
and the reaction will proceed spontaneously to the right. Conversely, if 
LlG is positive, E is negative and the reaction will proceed spontaneously 
to the left. If tlG = 0, E = 0, and from Eq. 7·8 we obtain 
Eo=RT1nK (7.9) 
nF 
because, at equilibrium, Q = K. 
The application of the Nernst equation to the reactions that take place 
in an electrochemical cell and in solution is illustrated in Examples 7·6 
and 7·7, respectively.

Thus the remaining Mn02(S) will continue to oxidize the 1-. 
We can make Eq. 7-8 applicable to a half-reaction by writing the half­
reaction in combination with the standard hydrogen electrode reaction. 
For example, for the reduction of cupric copper (Cu'+) to cuprous copper 
(Cu+), 
EO = 0.16 
Applying Eq. 7-8, we obtain 
RT {W}{Cu+} 
= 0.16 -pin {Cu'+}(P

and when activity effects are negligible,

Thus the Nernst equation for an overall reaction involving the standard 
hydrogen electrode is the same as the N';rnst equation for the half­
reaction and the potentiaL E, is a function of the activities of the reactants 
and products of the half-reaction other than e-_ In the following sections 
of this book, we will follow the practice of writing the Nernst equation for 
half-reactions without explicit reference to the standard hydrogen elec­
trode. 
Furthermore, we will follow the common practice of referring to the 
potential E as E H (the redox potential) when the half-reaction is written 
as a reduction reaction. The subscript H is used to emphasize that the 
potential only has meaning in reference to the standard hydrogen 
electrode reaction. Using this nomenclature, Eq. 7-10 is written as

presence of 10-3 moles S032-/liter and 10-4 moles SO/-/liter at a pH of 81 Neglect 
ionic strength effects. 
Solution 
From Table 7-1, EO = -0.04 for the reduction half-reaction. Applying the Nernst 
equation, Eq. 7-8, we obtain 
EH =Eo -0.0591ogQ n 
0.059 ( [80,'-] )

0.059 [ 10-3 ] 
= -0.04 --2-1og (10 8)'(10 4) 
= -0.50 vol! 
Note that determining the potential of a half·reaction is the same as determining 
the emf of a cell in which one electrode is the standard hydrogen electrode and 
at the other electrode the half-reaction in question proceeds. If the potential is to 
be called a redox potential. the laUer reaction must be written as a reduction 
reaction. 
We must be careful not to use E H values for half-reactions in the same 
way as the E values for overall reactions. The value of EH for a half­
reaction simply tells us the potential relative to the H+/H"g) half-reaction, 336 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions 
whereas the value of E for an overall reaction tells us whether or not that 
reaction is at equilibrium. Remembering this will eliminate much con· 
fusion in the use of E H values. 
7.3.5. Formal Potentials 
The E and EO values as used in the Nernst equation are defined in terms 
of the activities of individual species. In very dilute solutions in which 
there is no formation of complexes, concentration can be used in place 
of activity and there is no need to account for the portion of the total 
concentration of a species that might be complexed. In many solutions. 
however, ionic interactions, complex formation. and acid-base reactions 
must be taken into account. Formal potentials, E' and EO' are often used 
for this purpose and apply only to a given set of solution conditions. For 
example, for the half·reaction 
Fe3+ + e-:;;::. Fe2+ 
the Nernst equation, Eq. 7·8, is 
whereas the Nernst equation using formal potentials is 
E H' = EOI _ RT In C T,Fe(ID 
F CT,Fe(JID 
where CT.h(II) and CT."mD represent the analytical concentrations of Fe(I!) 
and Fe(II!), respectively, regardless of the degree of complexation, ionic 
interactions, and so forth. Whereas EO has a value of +0.77 volts, the 
value of EO' changes as the solution composition changes. For example, 
EO' = +0.68 volts in a Cu, = 0.1 M, H2S04 = I M solution. 
7.3.6. The Electron Balance and Equilibrium Calculations 
In making equilibrium calculations for redox reactions it is often 
necessary to make use of the electron balance. The equation is analogous 
to the proton balance and is based on the principle that electrons are 
conserved. For example, when CI, is added to a solution, the following 
half·reactions take place: 
Cl, + 2e-->2CI-
Cl, + 2H,O -> 2HOCI + 2H+ + 2e-
Given that these half·reactions are the only ones of importance and that 
no CI-or HOCI was present before the CI, was added, we obtain the 
electron balance by establishing an electron reference level (ERL) as the 
species that are either oxidized or reduced and with which the solution 
was prepared. In this example, the solution was prepared with H,O and Redox Equilibria 337 
CI" but only CI, is oxidized or reduced so it alone is the ERL. Each CI­
formed has one electron more than the CI at the ERL; each CI in HOCI 
has one electron less than the ERL. Thus the electron balance is 
[HOCI] = [CI-] 
In the oxidation of Fe'+ by Cr,O,'-, 
6Fe2+ -> 6Fe3+ + 6e-
Cr,O,'-+ 14H+ + 6e --> 2Cr3+ + 7H,O 
The ERL is Fe'+ and Cr,O,'-. One electron is produced for each Fe3+ 
formed and three electrons are used in the formation of each Cr3+. Since 
there are no other sources or sinks of electrons and given that no Fe3+ or 
Cr3+ was in the solution prior to adding Cr,O,'-and Fe'+' the electron 
balance yields

7,4, ELECTRON ACTIVITY AND p. 
The concept of electron activity is used in the description of oxidation· 
reduction equilibria and especially in the solution of problems that 
involve both redox and other equilibria such as acid·base, complexation, 
and so forth. In addition, this concept provides a useful basis for the 
graphical representation of complicated redox equilibria. The approach 
is extremely useful when working with redox equilibria in natural waters. Electron Activity and p€ 339 
However, when problems are concerned with topics such as analytical 
methods and corrosion that involve electrochemical cells, it is often more 
convenient to work with potentials and the Nernst equation because this 
can be related directly to voltage measurements. Whatever the system or 
situation it is beneficial to know how to "do it both ways." We will instruct 
the reader how to readily use both methods interchangeably. 
The negative logarithm of electron activity, pE = -log {e-}, is analogous 
to pH, the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity. Whereas pH 
is a measure of the availability of protons in solution (even though no 
free protons exist in solution), pE is a measure of the availability of 
electrons in solution (even though no free electrons exist in solution). The 
equations for the development of pH and pE can be compared, 
pH 
(I) HA""W+A-; K, 
(2) H+ + H20"" H30+; K 2 
(3) HA + H20"" H30+ + A-; K3 
By convention, K2 = I. Thus K3 = K,K2 = K, and K, = {H+}{A -}/{HA} or 
{A-} 
pH = pK, + log {HA} 
where pH = -log {H+}, and pK, = -log K
" where K, is for the acid 
dissociation half-reaction (with the proton on the right-hand side of the. 
equation). 
pE

(2) !H"" "" H+ + e -; K 2 
(3) M2+ + !H"" "" M+ + H+; K 3 
By convention, K2 = I. Thus K3 = K,K2 = K, and 
or 
{M+} 
pE = pEa -log {M2+} 
where pE = -log {e -} and pEa = log K " where K 1 is for the reduction half­
reaction (with the electron on the left-hand side of the equation). 
For acid-base equilibria the proton exchange reaction between H30+ 
and H20 at standard conditions is assigned a free energy change of zero 
and an equilibrium constant of unity. It provides the datum to which all 
other acid base reactions are referenced. For redox equilibria, the 340 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions 
reduction of H+ to tH2(g) at standard conditions is assigned a free energy 
change of zero and an equilibrium constant of unity. It provides the 
reference point for defining pE. 
Taking the reduction of ferric ion, Fe3+, to ferrous ion, Fe2+, as an 
example, we can write 
EO, ( nFEO) 
volts K =exp RT 
(I) Fe3+ + e-~ Fe2+ +0.77 
(2) ~H2(9J ---7 H+ + e- 0 
(3) Fe3+ + ~H2(9) ~ H+ + FeN +0.77 
Writing the equilibrium constant for (I), we have 
{Fe2+} 
K, = {Fe3+}{e } 
Taking logarithms, we obtain 
{Fe'+} _ 
log K, = log {Fe3+} -log {e } 
Setting pE = -log {e-} and PEo = log K" we find that 
{Fe2+} 
pE = PEo -log {Fe3+} 
pE = PEo = log K, K,= 1013 
K,= I 
K3= 1013 
(7·11) 
For comparison, knowing that {H+} = {H2(g,} = I, we can write for reaction

and 
EH=EO~(:;) InU~:::D 
Rearranging this equation and substituting n = I yields

Comparing this equation with Eq. 7-11 for 25°C, we find that

where 'Eo is the standard potential for the reduction half-reaction. Several 
useful pE relationships are summarized in Table 7-2. 
For any half-reaction, 
a similar development shows, 
pE = PEo -! log ({red})

where 
I p€°=-logK

(7 -17) 
where K is the equilibrium constant for the reduction half-reaction. Again 
FEH 
pE = (2.3RT) (= 16.9E H at 25°C) (7 -18) 
and 
, FEo 
PEo = (2.3RT) (= 16.9 EO at 25°C) (7-19) 
where EH and EO apply to the reduction half-reaction. Also, since tl.G 
-nFE, 
and -tl.G pE = 
2.3nRT 
-tl.GO 
PEo = 2.3nRT (7-20) 
(7 -21) 
From these interrelationships we can deduce that PEo is proportional to 
the free energy change accompanying the transfer of I mole of electrons 
from a reducing agent at unit activity to H+ at unit activity. Several pE 
relationships for use when more than one electron is exchanged are also 
summarized in Table 7-2. 
Note that pE only applies to a half-reaction; thus its value cannot be 
used to indicate position of that half-reaction with respect to equilibrium, 
contrary to the value of E for an overall reaction. However, if two half­
reactions in the same solution have equal values of pE, those half­
reactions are in equilibrium. 
The application of pE is illustrated in the following example.

7,5, GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF REDOX EQUILIBRIA 
Graphical presentation of redox equilibria, like the graphical treatment 
of acid-base, complexation, and precipitation equilibria is helpful in 
understanding complicated problems and in obtaining approximate so­
lutions to equilibrium questions. For redox systems in natural waters the 
equilibrium condition is truly a boundary condition. In many cases, 
natural systems are not at equilibrium from a redox standpoint. The 
diagrams usually present an idea of what is possible, not necessarily of 
the existing or imminent situation. The graphical presentations of redox 
equilibria are seldom simple because redox reactions usually involve " , 344 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions 
changes in solution composition other than electron transfer. Usually, pH 
changes must be considered and often complexation and solubility 
equilibria must be superimposed on redox equilibrium diagrams to obtain 
a realistic picture of the situation. 
In this section we will first present the development of a simple diagram 
(the so·called PE'PC or EH"PC diagram) for a reaction that involves only 
electron transfer in a homogeneous system. Next we will consider the 
predominance area diagrams for presenting combined redox and aci9.­
base equilibria. Finally, we will add a third dimension and consider 
systems with multiple phases using the pE.pH predominance area dia­
gram. 
7.5.1. The PE-PC Diagrams 
Let us first examine an aqueous solution at 25°C in which the half­
reaction between Fe3+ and Fe2+ governs the redox conditions. The solution 
is maintained at pH 2 so that Fe3+ and FeH are the major ferric and 
ferrous iron species, respectively, and the formation of hydrolysis products 
is negligible. There is a total analytical concentration of iron of CT•F, = 
10-' M. 
We proceed with the construction of this diagram using methods similar 
to those employed for preparing acid-base equilibrium diagrams. Al­
though we use pE in our development of the diagram (Fig. 7-3), we can 
show EHversus pC too, since pE has a fixed relationship toE, for example, 
at 25°C, pE = 16:9 EH (Eq. 7-19). 
Equilibrium Relationship (from Table 7-1) 
EO = +0.77 volt, PEo = 13.0 
From Eq. 7-16, neglecting ionic strength effects, 
[Fe'+] 
pE = pEa -log [Fe3+] 
Mass Balance [Fe'+] 
pE = 13 -log [Fe3+] (7-22) 
(7 -23) 
Like the pC-pH diagrams, the first equation we plot is the mass balance, 
which in logarithmic form is 
-logCT•F, = 4 (7 -24) 
Equation 7-24 is not a function of pE so it plots as a horizontal line at pC 
= 4 (line 1, Fig. 7-3). Graphical Representation of Redox Equilibria 345

Fig. 7-3. The pe.pC diagram for a Fe2+/Fe3+ system at 25°C, pH = 2. 
Now we will develop the -log concentration versus pE lines for Fe'+ 
and FeH. In logarithmic form Eq. 7-22 becomes 
(7-25) 
When pE» PE' (= 13), Eq. 7-25 indicates that log [Fe'+] »Iog [FeN]. For 
example, when pE = +15, Eq. 7-25 becomes 
15 -13 = log [Fe3+] -log [FeN] = 2 
Thus at pE = + 15, [Fe3+] = 100[Fe'+] and therefore [Fe2+] is negligible 
compared to [Fe3+]. From the mass balance equation, 
with Cu, = [FeN] + [Fe3+] 
[Fe'+] » [Fe'+] 
Cu, = [Fe'+] = 10-4 
-log [Fe'+] = 4 (7-26) I 
I. 
I 
1-346 Oxidation~Reduction Reactions 
Thus in the region of the PE-PC diagram where pE » PEo, the -log 
{Fe'+] line is a horizontal line at pC = 4 (line 2, Fig. 7-3). 
Substituting Eq. 7-26 in Eq. 7-25 yields 
pE = -log [Fe2+] + 9 (7-27) 
which again is valid for the region pE » pEo. Equation 7-27 has a slope 
of + I and passes through the point (-log [Fe2+] = 4, pE = 13). This line 
is plotted as line 3 in Fig. 7-3. I! is dashed in the region where pE is close 
to PEo because here the assumption that pE » PEo does not hold. . 
By a similar type of reasoning, a line for -log [Fe'+] versus pE and -log 
[Fe'+] versus pE can be developed in the region where pE « pEo. These 
are plotted in Fig. 7-3 as lines 4 and 5, respectively. 
Equation 7-25 shows that when pE = PEo = + 13, log [Fe'+] = log [Fe'+]' 
and when 
we find 
or 
-log [Fe'+] = -log [Fe'+] = 4.3 
After plotting these points, we can complete the diagram in the vicinity 
of pE = PEo as shown. The straight line portions of each line are connected 
with the curved lines in the region approximately one pE unit from PEo, 
just as was done for the pC-pH diagrams for acid base systems. However, 
this latter step depends on the slopes of the concentration lines. 
I! is interesting to plot on the Same diagram two equations that show 
the redox stability limits of water. Since the reactions of solutes we wish 
to examine take place in aqueous solution, we should know whether the 
redox reactions we are describing are possible while the solvent, water, 
is stable. At high pE, or under highly oxidizing conditions, H,O can be 
converted to oxygen. The half-r!,action, 
4e -+ 4H+ + 02(91 '" 2H,O; 
Knowing PEo = 16.9 EO at 25°C, Eq. 7-16, EO = + 1.23 volts 
° I I pE = pE -;; og Po,[H+]4 
yields 
pE = 20.8 + t log Po, -pH 
For pH = 2, 
pE = 18.8 + t log Po, (7 -28) 
(7 -29) Graphical Representation of Redox Equilibria 347 
This equation plots as line 6 in Fig. 7-3 with -log Po, on the -log 
concentration scale. If the pE is controlled Jjy the O,,,,iH,O half-reaction, 
this line shows that a solution in equilibrium with 0.21 atm of oxygen at 
pH 2 has a pE ~ + 18.6. (Note: Two half-reactions taking place in the same 
solution may not be in equilibrium with each other. II not, the pE calculated 
using one half-reaction will differ from the pE calculated from the other 
half-reaction.) 
Next the reduction of water to hydrogen gas must be considered as the 
lower bound of the stability field of water.

which plots as shown, line 7, Fig. 3. (7 -30) 
(7 -31) 
The PE-PC diagram conveys the idea that both FeH and Fe3+ have 
regions where they can be the predominant species in water at pH 2. 
However, if FeH is to predominate and be in equilibrium with the O,/H,O 
couple, the solution must essentially be stripped of dissolved oxygen. For 
example, at pE values of less than 13, Fe'+ will predominate whep. the 
oxygen partial pressure in equilibrium with the water couple is less than 
10-22 atm. 
Example 7-11 
1. What is the predominant iron species in oxygenated water at pH 2 and 
25°C? Assume a" normal earth atmosphere and that the iron species are in 
equilibrium with the OiH 20 couple. 
2. What are the predicted equilibrium concentrations of Fe2+ and Fe3+ under 
these conditions foI.: a solution containing 1O~4 M total iron? 
3. Does p€ change significantly when the pH is changed to 6? 
4. At pH 2 what partial pressure of oxygen would be in equilibrium with a 
solution containing lOS times as much Fe'2+ as Fe3+? 
Neglect solids and hydroxo.Fe complexes. 
Solution 
1. From Fig. 7·3, a solution in equilibrium with Po: = 0.21 atm has p€ = +18.6. 
At this pE, Fe3+ predominates. I-348 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions 
2. At pE ~ + 18.6, [Fe3+] ~ 10-' M and [FeH] ~ 10-'" M. 
3. As the pH is changed to 6, the pE value of the 02/H20 couple will change 
because [H+] is involved in this equilibrium. From Eq. 7-28 
pE = pe" + ±logPo2 -pH 
~ 20.8 -0.17 - 6 
~ + 14.6 
From Fig. 7-3, at pE ~ +14.6, [Fe'+] ~ 10-4 and [Fe"] = 10-'-'. 
Ferric iron is still the major species and the equilibrium concentrations 
have not changed significantly from the standpoint of the iron couple. 
However, as we shall see later in our discussion of iron chemistry, the 
kinetics of ferrous iron oxidation by oxygen plays a highly significant role 
in determining the form of iron found in oxygenated solutions of different 
pH values. Just to whet the reader's appetite, we ccrn state that although 
the equilibrium calculations show Fe3+ as the predomipant species at both 
pH 2 and pH 6, experiments show that, at pH 2, Fe2+ is essentially not 
oxidized in oxygenated solutions while at pH 6 its oxidation to Fe3+ is rapid. 
4. From Fig. 7-3, [Fe"] ~ 10' [Fe3+] when pE ~ +7.0. Since we assume that the 
oxygen couple is in equilibrium with the iron, this will also be the pE value 
for the 021H20 couple. Because the graph for P02 versus pE does not extend 
to pE = 7, we use Eq. 7-29 to calculate P02 
pE ~ +7 ~ +18.8 + ilog Po, 
P 02 = 10-41 atm 
Thus Fe2+ is only stable at minutely small partial pressures of oxygen and, 
based on equilibrium calculations, should be oxidized to Fe3+ when there 
is any measurable quantity of dissolved oxygen in water. 
7,5,2, The pE-pH Predominance Area Diagram 
The construction of a pE-pH or E IrpH diagram is the next step in 
complexity in the graphical representation of redox equilibria. In such 
diagrams we establish areas of predominance in a pE-pH coordinate 
system for various species involved in redox, acid-base, precipitation, 
and complexation equilibria. 
We will illustrate the construction of a pE-pH diagram for the aqueous 
chlorine system. For the construction of such diagrams we must first state 
the ground rules for drawing boundaries between any two species. There 
are two basic rules: 
I. Boundaries will only be drawn between the two major species under 
a given set of conditions. 
2. A boundary will be drawn between two species at the place where 
the concentration of the two species is equal. Thus, on one side of 
the boundary, one of the species predominates in concentration Graphical Representation of Redox Equilibria 349 
and. on the other side. the second species predominates. Combining 
these ground rules allows us to state 'that boundaries in apE-pH 
diagram are drawn at places of significant equality. 
The first thing to consider is the stability domain of water. For the half­
reaction, 
we have from Eq. 7-28 
pE = +20.8 + t log Po, -pH 
At Po, = 0.21 atm 
pE = 20.6 -pH (7-32) 
In the pE-pH diagram this plots as a straight line. line I in Fig. 7-4. At a 
given pH. if pE lies above line I. H20 is converted to O"g)' If pE lies below 
the line. H20 is stable. 
For the reduction of water. 
2H20 + 2e -;;= H"g) + 20H-
From Eq. 7-30. 
pE = -14 -~ log PH, + pOH 
and when PH, = I. 
pE = -14 + pOH (7 -33) 
This plots as a straight line in the pE-pH diagram (line 2. Fig. 7-4). At a 
given pH and a H"g) pressure of I atm. if pE is above this line H,O is 
stable. while if it is below this line. H20 is reduced to H"g). As PH, 
decreases. the H20!H2 line is raised thereby making smaller the area of 
H20 stability. 
Next we must list all the species invoIved,4n the reactions of interest. 
For the aqueous chlorine system these are 
CI",q). HOC!. OCI-. and CI-
Then we set up equations in terms of pH and pE relating each species to 
each of the other species. The necessary equilibria can either be obtained 
from Table 7-1. or from combining the equilibria in this table. In writing 
the redox equilibria. we must remember to follow the golden rule -of 
always writing the reactions as reductions. We have four basic equations 
to work with. I. , 350 Oxidation.Reduction Reactions

This equation appears as line 7 in Fig. 7-4. (7 -38) 
We can now use reasoning to finalize the drawing of the diagram. For 
example, we have not yet dealt with the OCI-/CI2(") relationship. This 
line will fall somewhere between the OCI-and Cl, regions in Fig. 7-4. 
However, we have already shown that to the right of line 3, and below 
line 4, CI2{aq} is not a predominant species. Thus we can save ourselves 
the time of establishing this line, since we are only interested in 
boundaries between predominant species. We can also ask why line 5 
terminates at the intersection of lines 6 and 7. Below line 7, CI-predom­
inates over OCI-; below line 6, C]-predominates over HOC!. Again we 
are only interested in boundaries between predominant species and we 
must therefore terminate line 5 as shown.' 
From the diagram we can draw the following conclusions for a 10-4 M 
Cr,cl solution. 
I. CI2(,q) as a predominant species only exists at low pH values (below 
pH 0). As Gr.cI increases, similar calculations show the pH value at 
which C12{aq) predominates increases. 
2. At higher pH values, CI2(,q) disproportionates into HOCI and CI-. 
3. Chloride ion is the stable chlorine-containing species in-the pe-pH 
range of natural waters. 
5 Systems much more complex than aqueous chlorine are time-consuming to 
draw. Other advanced texts in this area (e.g., W. Stumm and J. J. Morgan, 
Aquatic Chemistry, Wiley.lnterscience, 1970) illustrate procedures whereby 
such diagrams can be drawn. 354 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions 
4. CI2(,q), HOC!. and OC1-are stronger oxidants than O2 in accordance 
with the reaction, 
2HOCI "" 2Cl-+ 2H+ + 02(,q) 
which is the sum of the two half-reactions, 
2H20 "" 4H+ + 4e -+ 02{'Q) 
2HOCI + 2H+ + 4e-"" 2Cl-+ 2H20 
This reaction is basically the oxidation of water to oxygen by 
chlorine, which itself is reduced to chloride ion. The reaction 
proceeds only when catalyzed, for example, by ultraviolet light. It 
is the reaction that accounts for the "decay" of chlorine solutions 
that are exposed to sunlight. 
S. Only Cr.CI = 10-4 was used in these calculations, but the use of 
other values of CT.CI shows that the boundaries in Fig. 7-4 vary little 
with CT,CI' Thus the diagram in Fig. 7-4 is generally applicable at 
other total concentrations as well. 
7.5.3. Other Predominance Area Diagrams 
In the previous section we used pH and pE as the coordinates of the 
diagram. Frequently, the concentration of one species of a system can 
significantly affect the concentrations of other species that are present; 
in this case a diagram with the concentration of that species as one 
variable, together with pH as the other variable, can be most useful. To 
develop such a diagram, it is necessary to combine half-reactions to form 
overall reactions, thus eliminating pE, or E:H, as a variable. 
For example, let us consider such a predominance area diagram for 
aqueous bromine species at 25" in which the diagram axes are pH and 
the negative log of the bromide concentration. 
The overall reactions relating the species of interest are 
1. Br2('Q) + H20 ¢ HOBr + H+ + Be; 
2. HOBr "" OBe + H+; pK, = 8.4. 
K = 15.9. 
We will use a similar approach to that used for constructing pE-pH 
diagrams. Lines representing equality of concentration between signifi­
cant species are sought in the form of equations containing [Be] and pH 
-the two axes of the diagram. The species are

When [OBcJ = [HOBrJ. this equation simplifies to 
pH = 8.4 
which plots as line I in Fig. 7-5. 
To derive the relationship for HOBr and Br, -it is necessary to combine 
equations (I) and (3). In logarithmic form we have 
. [HOBrJ -9.4 = 2 log [BeJ -pH + log J 
When [HOBrJ = [Br,-J. 
log [BcJ = -4.7 + ~pH

This equation plots in the region where [HOBr] predominates over [OBr-] 
so that it does not represent a significant equality and is therefore not 
shown in Fig. 7-5.

[HOBr] log (6 x 10-') = log [H+] + log [Be] + log O;[BO------:­

When [HOBr] = [Br",q,] 
log [Be] = -8.22 + pH

[Br3 -]

I2(aq)] 
log [Be] = -1.2 (7 ·42) 
This plots as a horizontal line at -log [Be] = 1.2 (line 5 in Fig. 7-5). 
Using the same type of reasoning that was employed in the construction 
of the pE-pH diagram in Fig. 7-4, we can map out the significant boundaries 
in Fig. 7-5. 
The bromide concentration of most fresh natural waters is oSl mgJliter. 
Seawater contains about 70 mg Belliter (~1O-3 M). Therefore, from this 
diagram we can conclude that in most natural waters bromine will be 
present as the undissociated HOBr.

extremely important from the standpoint of disinfection efficiency. For 
example. the ability of "chlorine" to kill coliform organisms is 80 to 100 
times greater when the chlorine is present as HOCI than when it is 
present as OCI-. 
7.5.4. The pE·pH Diagrams Incorporating Solids 
The last step in complexity that we will explore in detail for the 
construction of diagrams to illustrate redox equilibria involves the ad· 
dition of heterogeneous equilibria to redox and acid·base equilibrium 
diagrams. We will illustrate this system with a pE.pH diagram for iron 
species in aqueous solution containing no anions other than hydroxide, 
We will expand on this diagram later in this chapter during the discussion 
of iron chemistry. 
First we must identify which solids and solution components are 
important. For an unknown system we would achieve this by searching' 
the literature for relevant reactions and equilibrium data. In this example 
the following components are of interest. 
SOLIDS 
Fe(OH)",) 
Fe(OH)",) SOLUTION COMPONENTS 
Fe3+ 
FeOH2+ 
Fe(OH)2+ 
Fe2+ 
FeOH+ 
The task of diagram construction is broken down into four stages. 
I. Boundaries are construoted between the solids of interest if more 
than one solid exists. 
2. Boundaries are constructed between solids and individual solution 
components. A concentration of dissolved component is selected 
and the stipulation is made that the solid/solution boundary is valid 
for the selected concentration of the indicated solution component. 
For our example we will use a Fe concentration of 10-7 M (5.6 p.g Fel 
liter) although in the later discussion of iron chemistry several 
solid·solution boundaries are entered on a single diagram to 
represent different solution concentrations of Fe species at the 
boundary. 
3. The complete solids·solution boundary (with various solution com· Graphical Representation of Redox Equilibria 359 
. ponents in different parts of the diagram) is constructed. When 
significant boundaries are in doubt; they can be established by 
testing various pE-pH coordinates in the equations in Table 7-3 to 
determine the species of significance. 
4. For the region of the diagram that describes solution (away from 
solids predominance areas), the equilibria between solution com­
ponents are plotted for all combinations of solution components. 
Significant boundaries are deduced as lines of equal concentration 
of solution components. 
We will not present many of the detailed considerations required for 
deciding significant boundaries between the various solids and species 
because this would needlessly complicate the presentation. For a full 
description of the procedure for developing a diagram such as this using 
other types of diagrams as aids, see Stumm and Morgan.' 
To develop the diagram, we first enter in Fig. 7·7 the stability limits of 
water that were established for Fig. 7-4. Next we refer to Table 7-3 that 
presents equations that interrelate all species and solids. We would find, 
from a detailed study of the diagram construction, that only a few of 
these equations describe significant boundaries: moreover, these equa­
tions apply only in specific regions of the diagram. 
Line I is the boundary between the two solids Fe(OH)2{,' and Fe(OH)"". 
Along this line Fe(OH)"" and Fe(OH)2{,' are in equilibrium with each other. 
At very low pE values, a third solid, Fe", (metallic iron) may be formed 
(e.g., below pE = -7.4 in the pH range 0-8). We will not consider this 
solid as part of the diagram. 
We now develop the diagram for the equilibria of the solids Fe(OH)"" 
and Fe(OH)"" with soluble species. These lines describe the boundaries 
of the two solids. The region to the right of and above these lines is the 
area of predominance of the solids. To the left of and below these lines, 
dissolved components predominate. The dividing line between solids and 
solution is based on a maximum soluble iron concentration of 10-7 M. Of 
the 10 equations in Table 7-3 relating solids to soluble Fe-species, only 
4 are employed in the diagram construction. The rest describe insignificant 
boundaries. 
We next proceed to the solution equilibria, (equations 12 through 21 in 
Table 7·3). Of these 10 equations,S describe significant boundaries and 
are plotted in Fig. 7-7. 
If we examine Fig. 7-7, we find that a Fe(OH),+ predominance region 
does not appear. However an area occupied by Fe(OH), + does exist but 
because of the selection of a solidslsolution equilibrium concentration, 
CT,F' , of 10-7 and because of our rounding off of equilibrium constants,

the area becomes so small it is difficult to draw in on the scale used. 
Equation 21 (Table 7 ·3) states: 
[FeOH'+] = [Fe(OH),+] at pH 4.7 
while equation 8 is 
pH = 1.2 -t log [FeOH'+] 
which, when [FeOH2+] = 10-7 M, reduces to pH = 4.7. Thus the solid 
phase boundary with FeOH'+ is superimposed on the equality line 
between [FeOH'+] and [Fe(OH),+]. A small region would exist for Fe(OH),+ 
had our choice of solution Cu, been smaller than 10-7 M. 
One striking feature of the diagram is the large area occupied by Fe'+. Corrosion 363 
From this observation we might suspect that, in the absence of oxygen, 
iron in solution has a very good chance of being present as ferrous ion. 
In the later section on iron chemistry we will follow up on this observation. 
This is as far as we will go in the details of diagram construction. 
However, we will continue to present diagrams (some of greater com­
plexity), knowing that the reader will understand them and appreciate 
the time that it takes to construct them. The diagram for the iron system 
in Fig. 7-7 only considers the soluble species Fe'+, Fe'+, and hydroxo iron 
. species. Such diagrams become more useful (as we shall see in the 
section on iron chemistry) when other iron-containing solids and species 
such as carbonates and sulfides are introduced. When this is done the 
diagram is more complex but the rules of the game are the same. An 
additional constraint is introduced in that the total concentration of anion 
(e.g .. total carbonate carbon or total sulfur) must be specified. There is 
an individual diagram for each specified anion level. A further useful 
presentation is to draw more than one boundary between solid phases 
and solution species. Each boundary represents a different selected total 
solution concentration of iron (e.g .. 10-', 10-', 10-5 M, etc). Such diagrams 
help us to judge the solution concentration of species at various p€ and 
pH values. 
7,6, CORROSION 
Corrosion is the deterioration of metallic structures, usually with the 
loss of metal to solution. It manifests itself in many ways including 
rusting, pitting, tuberculation, cracking (or embrittlement) etc. Corrosion 
is a costly and wasteful process; it has been estimated that some 25 
percent of the annual production of steel in the United States is for the 
replacement of material lost to corrosion'? 
All refined metals have a tendency to revert to a thermodynamically 
more stable form such as those in which they occur naturally on earth. 
Thus one of the corrosion products of iron is iron oxide (Fe,O",,) which is 
one form of iron ore. Almost all types of corrosion can be explained in 
terms of electrochemistry (oxidation-reduction reactions); for this reason 
we will consider corrosion as an example of the application of redox 
chemistry or electrochemistry to a practical situation. We will not present 
a detailed quantitative analysis of corrosion and the design of corrosion­
control systems. Other texts should be consulted for this type of infor-
mation_ . 
7,6.1. The Corrosion Cell 
For corrosion to occur, the presence of all the components of an 
electrochemical cell is required. These components are an anode, a

Electric Conference, University of California, Davis, February 1964. I' , '

cathode, and an internal circuit or conducting solution (electrolyte). 
between the anode and cathode. An anode and cathode are sites on a 
metal that have a difference in potential between them. If anyone of 
these components is absent, a corrosion cell does not exist and no 
corrosion will occur. 
That mystery often surrounds the process of corrosion is probably 
because of the hard·to·recognize forms that the electrochemical cell takes. 
Persons accustomed to the laboratory will visualize an electrochemical 
cell as a beaker containing electrolyte in which to pieces of metal are 
immersed and joined externally with a wire. It is difficult to make the 
translation between this situation and that of a water pipe running 
through alternate marshy and sandy patches of soil, yet both are electro­
chemical cells-<:md both will be subject to the reactions that go to make 
up corrosion. 
Figure 7-8 illustrates the general features of a galvanic cell indicating 
the direction of current and electron flow. The oxidation (removal of 
electrons) or dissolution of metal occurs at the anode, which consequently 
is negatively charged. Reduction (consumption of electrons) or deposition 
of metal occurs at the cathode, which consequently is positively charged. 
We have previously discussed a galvanic cell of this kind in Example 7-
6, where zinc metal was the anode and corroded to form zinc ions; copper 
was the cathode and copper ions in the copper chloride solution surround­
ing the cathode plated out as copper metal. We can visualize a similar 
situation existing when a copper water pipe is connected to a galvanized 
(zinc-coated steel) pipe (Fig. 7-9). The galvanized pipe is the anode and 
the copper pipe is the cathode. The electrolyte is the water flowing

through the pipe. The external circuit is the pipe materiaL and contact 
between the zinc and copper is required. 
Corrosion cells can be far more subtle. For example, electrical code 
states that a neutral wire must be bonded to a water pipe. If it is connected 
to a galvanized pipe in one residence and a copper pipe in a neighboring 
dwelling, we have the makings of a corrosion cell (Fig. 7·10). The 
galvanized pipe is the anode; the copper pipe is the cathode. The common 
neutral wire is the external circuit. The moist soil surrounding the pipes 
is the electrolyte. . 
Corrosion cells can be produced by the interaction of small, local, 
adjacent anodes and cathodes on the same piece of metal. These so· 
called "local·action cells" form because the surface of a piece of metal is 
not uniform. Small variations in composition, local environment. orien­
tation of the grain structure, and differences in the amount of stress and 
surface imperfections all may contribute to the creation of tiny areas of

metal with different potentials. Therefore, a piece of iron is covered with 
many tiny corrosion cells. The reader can prove this by immersing a piece 
of iron into a dilute solution of Hel. The gas that bubbles from the surface 
of the iron is hydrogen being produced at the small local cathodes (Fig.

The galvanic series (Table 7 -4) is a listing of metals presented in the 
order of their tendency to corrode (or go into solution). The metals are 
listed in groups, and the metals within these groups can generally be 
used together safely (Le" without either one corroding significantly). If 
metals from separate groups are connected in a situation where a 
corrosion cell forms, the metal that is highest on the list will corrode. In 
general, the farther apart the metals, the greater will be the potential for 
corrosion because the potential difference between them will be greater. 
Basically, this list is in the order of decreasing oxidation potentials, but 
not exactly so. This is because the behavior of some metals from a 
corrosion standpoint is not solely dictated by differences in the electrode 
potential. For example, chromium and stainless steel each appear at two 
widely separated places in the list. At the higher position where they 
occur they are listed as "active"; at the lower position they carry the 
designation "passive." These metals become "active" (more subject to 
corrosion) when they are present in an oxygen-starved environment (the 
higher listing); they are passive. (less subject to corrosion} when they are 
in an environment with oxygen present (the lower listing).

The rate of corrosion (loss of metal) is proportional to the amount of

Thus the greater the potential difference (Le" the greater the separation 
in the galvanic series) and the lower the resistance, the greater will be 
the amount of current carried in the corrosion cell. Faraday's law states 
that the amount of a material that can be produced electrochemically is 
proportional to the amount of charge in COUlombs. A coulomb is the 
amount of charge transferred when I ampere flows for 1 second. One 
equivalent of a material on a charge basis (Avagadro's number of positive 
or negative charges) is produced by 1 Faraday or 96,500 coulombs. That

metal in a corrosion cell with a current of 1 amp flowing for 1 year. 
'.S.3. Corrosion Reactions 
Reactions occurring during corrosion are conveniently divided into 
those taking place at the anode and those taking place at the cathode. 
The reactions may be (and usually are) more extensive and complex than 
the primary oxidation reduction half-reactions. Let us consider the cor­
rosion of a piece of iron pipe. The basic galvanic cell is illustrated in Fig. 
'·12. 
At anodic areas an oxidation reaction releases Fe2+ ions into solution, 
leaves electrons behind in the metal, and produces a negative charge on 
the metal.

The electrons travel in the external circuit from the anode to the cathode; 
at the cathode they may react with H+ ions in solution to form hydrogen 
gas, which bubbles out of solution,

This is the reaction we mentioned previously in our discussion of the 
corrosion of iron in dilute He!. It is referred to as "hydrogen evolution 
corrosion. " 
Alternatively, if there is oxygen in the solution surrounding the cathode, 
the cathode reaction may produce water thus: 
4e -+ 4H+ + O"aq) :0= 2H,O 
In both of these cathodic reactions, H+ is consumed so that the pH rises 
and significant amounts of OH-ions appear. These ions migrate through 
the electrolyte toward the anode, thus conducting current through the 
solution. At the anode, if no oxygen is present and pH becomes sufficiently 
high, ferrous hydroxide will precipitate, 
Fe2+ + 20H-:0= Fe(OH)",)

Corrosion of an iron pipe under certain conditions can also manifest 
itself in the formation of "pits" and "tubercules" (Fig. 7-13). The OH­
produced by the cathodic reaction not only may precipitate Fe(OH),,;) and 
Fe(OH),,;) but can also react with bicarbonate ion (alkalinity) in the water 
to produce carbonate ion. In the locally high pH region around the

The exterior of iron pipes in marshy (anaerobic) soils are often coated 
with a black film of material that results from a mode of iron corrosion. 
The ferrous ions produced at the anode react with sulfide present in the

oxygen). The black ferrous sulfide is produced by reactions,

7.6.4, Concentration Cells 
If adjacent portions of a surface are in contact with a solution having 
metal ions of different concentration, a potential will develop that can 
result in corrosion. The corrosion process in such a situation will always 
tend to equalize the concentrations of metal ion by dissolving metal from 
the metal surface. Therefore, we can deduce that the portion of metal in 
contact with the dilute solution will become the anode-it will corrode 
and cbntribute metal ions to solution. The part of the metal in the more 
concehtrated metal ion solution will become the cathode and either metal 
ions will plate out on it or some oxidizing agent such as 0, will be 
reduced at its surface. 
To illustrate such a concentration cell let us consider the galvanic cell 
made up of a piece of zinc metal with two sites A and B (Fig. 7·14). Site

A is in contact with a solution containing 10-4 M zinc ion, and site B is in 
contact with a 10-3 M zinc ion solution. From the Nernst equation we can 
show that site A is the anode and site B is the cathode. To prove this, we 
will write the reaction assuming site A to be the anode and site B to be 
the cathode, and then examine the resulting potential to determine if the 
reaction will be spontaneous as written. 
at Site A: ZnA -> Zn.'+ + 2e-;

Since t>G = -nFE, t>G is negative and the reaction is spontaneous as 
written. Site A, in contact with the lower metal ion concentration, is the 
anode and site B, in contact with the higher metal ion concentration, is 
the cathode. 
One of the more common causes of corrosion due to concentration 
galvanic cells is the presence of different concentrations of dissolved 
oxygen or hydrogen ion at different sites on a metal surface. When caused 
by dissolved oxygen, this is often referred to as "differential oxygenation 
corrosion." Some examples of these situations are illustrated in Fig. 7-15. 
Common areas for differential oxygenation corrosion are between two 
metal surfaces. for example, under rivets, washers, or in crevices. Also 
common is the area beneath various types of surface adhesion, which 
may be things such as a barnacle, a bacterial slime, or a piece of mill 
scale. As with the concentration cell formed by two metal ion solutions 
of differing concentrations, the reaction in a differential aeration cell will 
proceed in a manner that tends to equalize the oxygen concentrations. 
Since oxygen is not produced by either the anode or cathode reaction, the 
corrosion will proceed in such a way that the higher oxygen concentration 
is reduced. Oxygen participates in the cathodic reaction

will be the cathode and the metal in contact with the lower oxygen 
concentration will be the anode and will corrode. This is consistent with 
the observation that corrosion takes place underneath adhesions on metal 
surfaces. 
Because 0, reduction depends on H+ concentration. differences in pH 
have the same effect as 0, concentration differences. Waters that have 
a high buffer intensity. /3. also will have less tendency to develop regions 
of different pH. and thus will not be as corrosive. 
Let us consider the example of a piece of iron with a barnacle growing 
on it (Fig. 7-15). Underneath the barnacle the oxygen concentration is 
lower than outside the confines of the barnacle shell. The ferrous iron 
and pH levels in solution at both places are assumed to be identical. We 
will examine the tendency of the corrosion reaction to proceed at both 
locations (A under the barnacle and B outside the barnacle). 
If we assume that the cathode is at A and the anode is at B.

Since tlG = -nFE, the free energy change is negative and there is a

than vice versa. If E R has been negative. B would have been the anode,

potentials are positive. Because there is oxygen at both sites, it is

7.S.S. Corrosion Control 
We have previously mentioned that all of the components of a galvanic 
cell must be present for corrosion to occur. Corrosion control functions by 
eliminating or reducing the effectiveness of one or more of these com· 
ponents. Thus we can control corrosion by eliminating anodes and 
cathodes. by eliminating or reducing differences in potential between 
metallic sites, and by breaking internal or external circuits. Some of these 
objectives are achieved by subtle methods but the secret in corrosion Corrosion 375 
control.· as in assessing a corrosion problem, is to reduce the situation to 
basic principles. ' 
I. Selection of Materials. The most obvious corrosion-combating meas­
ure in this category is to select nonmetallic materials or materials 
low in the galvanic series so that they are more likely to become 
cathodic rather than anodic. The choice, however, cannot be based 
solely upon the position of a metal in the galvanic series. Under 
certain conditions some metals high in the galvanic series form 
corrosion products. for example. metal oxides, that cling tenaciously 
to the metallic surface and block further corrosive attack or signif­
icantly reduce the rate of corrosion. They effectively protect the 
base metal beneath an oxide layer and render it "passive." A good 
example of this type of behavior is aluminum whose oxide is always 
present at an aluminum surface. Aluminum saucepans are dull and 
greyish after use because of the accumulation of the protective 
oxide film. Corrosion is very slow beneath the film. Some ions such 
as CI-can penetrate the aluminum oxide film and promote corrosion 
of the underlying metal. The CI-ion can apparently aid in the 
release of aluminum ions, possibly through the formation of soluble 
chloroaluminum complexes, and also aid in the pas.age of the 
electrical current necessary to maintain corrosion. For this reason 
aluminum is a poor choice of metal to be in contact with saline 
water. The City of San Francisco does not use aluminum light poles 
to the west of Twin Peaks because of the chloride content of the 
atmosphere close to the Pacific Ocean. When aluminum is immersed 
in a dilute mineral acid. the oxide film is dissolved away and rapid 
corrosion of the aluminum, accompanied by hydrogen evolution, 
occurs. 
Other metals also can be "passivated." For example the presence 
of 12 percent chromium in steel renders the steel passive in an 
oxygenated environment because it promotes the formation of a 
thin but tightly-bound oxide layer. The presence of chromates in 
the electrolyte will encourage the formation of 'Y-Fe,03 on iron 
surfaces, isolating the surfaces from corrosion. 
2. Coatings. Paints, cements, bituminous materials. wrappings, and 
precipitates, such as calcium carbonate, can all act to combat 
corrosion by isolating either or both the anode or the cathode. 
Painting for corrosion protection usually involves a thorough 
cleaning of the metal surface to remove any corrosion products 
followed by application of a primer containing a corrosion inhibitor 
such as zinc chromate or calcium plumbate; next follows a heavily 
pigmented undercoat for the purpose of reducing the permeation of 
water to the metal surface (elimination of the internal circuit-the 
electrolyte), finally a third decorative coat that is resistant to the 
atmosphere. ,

I 
, 376 Oxidation~Reduction Reactions 
Coating metallic structures to isolate them from the corrosive 
environment is often practiced, especially along buried pipelines 
that have anodic and cathodic regions. The cathodic areas are 
wrapped. The rationale is that if a small hole develops in the 
coating on a cathode, corrosion will proceed at a very low rate from 
a large anode to a small cathode (Fig. 7-16). The electrons generated 
over the large anodic area must be discharged to an oxidizing agent 
such as oxygen over a very small area. However, if the same small 
hole were to develop in a protective coating on an anode there 
would be a tiny anode area and a huge cathode. The electrons 
generated at the small anode could be rapidly discharged. All the 
current is generated from a small area and a pit, or hole in a pipe 
develops rapidly (Fig. 7-16). 
The protection of metal surfaces with a thin layer of CaCO,,,) (or 
CaCO",) containing iron salts) is one of the objectives underlying 
the conditioning of municipal water supplies to have a slightly 
positive Langelier Index prior to distribution (see Sec 6-7). It should 
be kept in mind, however, that the pH immediately adjacent to a 
metal surface may be different from that in the bulk solution. Thus 
a water that has a tendency to precipitate, that is, a positive 
Langelier Index, may not actually precipitate on the metal surface 
because of localized conditions in the immediate vicinity of the 
surface. The coating of metal pipes with scales such as CaCO",) 
can lead to corrosion problems if the scale accumulation is excessive 
or uneven. Uneven deposition and poor adhesion of scale is a 
problem, for example, when alkalinity and calcium concentrations

are low and pH is high.' Thus scale may be washed off by the 
flowing water in the pipe and leave exposed metal areas where 
corrosion can proceed. 
3. Insulation. It is often necessary to connect two types of metal. for 
example. galvanized water service pipes to a hot water heater from 
which copper hot water lines emerge. The corrosion cell that would 
develop in this case (Fig. 7-9) can be eliminated by inserting a 
dielectric coupling between the galvanized pipe and the copper 
pipe which effectively breaks the external circuit and eliminates 
the corrosion cell. However I this is not common practice because 
brass fixtures are used in nearly all systems instead of galvanized 
material. 
4. Chemical Treatment. A wide variety of chemicals and water treat· 
ments are used for corrosion control. Corrosion inhibitors usually 
act by forming some type of impervious layer on the metallic surface 
of either the anode or cathode that impedes the reaction at the 
electrode and thereby slows or inhibits the corrosion reaction. For 
example, various alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates, silicates, 
borates, phosphates, chromates, and nitrites promote the formation 
of a stable surface oxide on metals. The presence of these chemicals 
in the electrolyte allows any faults in the metal surface or its oxide 
film to be repaired. If they are used in too small a quantity as anodic 
inhibitors, they may promote intense local allack because they can 
leave a small unprotected area on the anode where the current 
density will be very high. This is particularly true of chromates and 
polyphosphates. 
Zinc sulfate can be used as a cathodic inhibitor. The Zn'+ ions in 
solution will react with OH-produced by the cathodic reactions or 
with carbonates to form sparingly soluble zinc precipitates that coat 
the cathode. 
We have seen that the presence of dissolved oxygen is important 
in several corrosion reactions such as differential aeration corrosion 
and the cathodic reaction with H+ to produce H.O. The elimination 
of dissolved oxygen from the electrolyte will prevent these reactions 
from occurring. It is common industrial water treatment practice to 
deoxygenate waters for circulating heating and cooling systems 
and boilers. Typical methods are to use sulfur dioxide (SO.) or 
~odium bisulfite (NaHS0 3) with cobalt as a catalyst, hydrazine 
(N.H,), or to use a degasilier. Steam degasilication is among the 
more common physical methods. 
5. Cathodic Protection. Cathodic protection is the technique of con· 
8 W. Stumm, "Investigations on the Corrosive Behavior of Water" Am. Soc. Civil 
Engrs, J. Sanit. Engr. Div., 86: 27 (1965). ['I 
378 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions 
verting-all of the structural components of interest into cathodes. 
I! can be achieved in two ways: 
I. by using a so-called sacrificial anode electrically connected to 
the material to be protected. The anode material is anodic to the 
entire system (less noble than the material to be protected) and will 
therefore convert it into a cathode. 
2. By impressing upon the system a doc current of a magnitude 
that opposes the current generated by the galvanic corrosion cell. 
In this case a piece of metal (e.g., scrap iron or graphite) is used 
as the anode. 
These two methods are illustrated in Fig. 7-17. To minimize the 
rate of degradation of the sacrificial anode, the external surface of 
the metal being protected is usually coated with a substance such 
as bitumin, thereby increasing resistance to the current flow. 
Sacrificial anodes for galvanic cathodic protection are commonly 
made from magnesium, which from Table 7-4 one can see is the 
least noble (most anodic) of all the metals listed. Zinc is also 
utilized, but it has a lower oxidation potential. Good electrical 
connections (by soldering or brazing) must be made between the 
sacrificial electrode and the structure to be protected. 
Galvanizing is another form of cathodic protection. A galvanized 
pipe is a steel pipe coated with a thin layer of zinc. Since zinc is 
anodic to steel (Table 7 -4), the zinc will corrode preferentially to the 
iron and so protect it. Moreover, the corrosion products of zinc, the 
carbonates and hydroxides, adhere to the galvanized surface and 
render it passive. 
7.7. IRON CHEMISTRY 
The redox reactions of iron are involved in several important phenomena 
occurring in natural waters and water treatment systems. The oxidation 
of reduced iron minerals, such as pyrite (FeS",,), produces acidic waters 
and the problem of acid mine drainage. The oxidationlreduction of iron 
in soil and ground waters determines the iron content of these waters. 
Redox reactions are intimately involved in the removal of iron from 
waters. As we have already seen in Section 7-6, the oxidation of metallic 
iron is an important corrosion reaction. 
The purpose of this section is to expand the discussion on the chemistry 
of iron and to use it as an example of redox reactions in natural waters. 
The reaction kinetics of redox reactions will be discussed using ferrous 
iron oxidation as an example.

to the p€-pH diagram for iron species in pure water presented earlier (Fig.

disulfide (FeS",,). The stability region of ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH),) has 
been reduced in size by FeS"" and FeCO"". It is important to note that 
the diagram in Fig. 7-18 has been drawn for a specified level of total 
inorganic carbon (C T.CO, = 10-3 M) and of total inorganic sulfur (C T.S = 10-' 
M). Another feature of this particular po-pH diagram is the presentation

When a well is drilled into the ground, one may visualize it as passing 
vertically down through the pE·pH diagram in Fig. 7·18. Such a "well,"

aerated (unsaturated) soil. The iron here is near equilibrium with atmos·

The iron content of waters from this region is very low because at pH 
6, for example, only a fraction of a p.g Fe'+llitei is in solution at equilibrium 
(see Fig. 6.7). They produce waters with a low pH because they are often 
in the biologically active zone 01 the soil where considerable CO, 
production takes place. Table 7-6. shows a partial analysis for this type 
of well water (Fe(OH)3(,' Zon",). The iron concentration shown is more than 
predicted, but this may be due to iron contained in organic complexes. 
Well inlet 3 (Fig. 7-lS) would be for a deep well that draws water from 
soil that is in equilibrium with pyrite, FeS"". In this soil zone the iron is 
in the form of lerrous iron and the sulfur in the form 01 sulfide; iron 
disulfide has precipitated. The iron content of the well water will be 
controlled by the reaction 
K = 10-26 
This reaction will allow the solution 01 less than I p.giliter 01 iron assuming 
that S,'-is the only sulfide species.9 Waters 01 this type have low iron 
contents and low sulfate levels, and they often contain traces 01 hydrogen 
sulfide. The analysis lor this type 01 water shown in Table 7-6 shows only 
slightly more iron than predicted. Unfortunately, no hydrogen sulfide 
determination was made. 
Well intake 2 (Fig. 7-lS) is in an intermediate zone between the Fe(OH)"" 
and FeS"" regions. In this region the mineral that controls the solution 
concentration 01 iron is ferrous carbonate (FeCO",J, usually the mineral 
siderite. 
FeCO"" + H+ ~ Fe'+ + HCO,-; K = 10-4•4 
At pH 6 and [HCO, -] = 10-' M, the predicted iron concentration is 
approximately 20 mglliter. Thus waters in this region can have signifi­
cantly higher dissolved iron contents than waters in equilibrium with 
Fe(OH)"" and FeS"" at a comparable pH. In Table 7-6 is shown a partial 
analysis for this type 01 water. Note also the increase in sulfate concen­
tration in the well water lrom the FeCO"" zone. This arises because we 
can treat the formation of an FeCO",,-zone water as the oxidation of 
FeS"" to ferrous sulfate, thus: 
2 x (SH,O + FeS"" ~ Fe'+ + 2S0,'-+ 16H+ + 14e-) 
7 x (4e-+ 4W + 0, ~ 2H,O) 
2H,O + 2FeS"" + 70, ~ 2Fe'+ + 4S0,'-+ 4H+ 
This equilibrium picture can be used to teach several lessons in well 
placement relative to water quality. Wells in the Fe(OH)"" zone have a 
high CO, content and a low pH value; they are potentially corrosive. For 
wells drilled into the FeS"" zone one must make certain that the surface

casing extends down to the FeS",) zone so that oxygen-containing water 
cannot enter this zone. In addition, the surface of the casing should be 
cemented to prevent corrosion of the casing in the Fe(OH),{,) zone that it 
passes through. This will also prevent oxidizing water from the Fe(OH)",) 
zone from running down the well casing into the FeS",) zone, Screens for 
such wells are set only in the FeS",) zone, and pumping is at a rate that 
keeps water above the screens from being drawn down into the FeS",)

Wells should not be located in the zone where iron solubility is governed 
by FeCO",), since they will produce a water that is unacceptably high in 
iron. 
7.7.2. Acid Mine Drainage 
Reaction kinetics are an interesting aspect of iron chemistry in addition 
to the redox and precipitation reactions discussed in the previous section. 
The consideration of kinetics is very important in problems of water­
quality significance such as acid mine drainage and the removal of iron 
from water. At pH values of greater than 5.5 the rate law for the 
oxygenation of ferrous iron is 10 
-d[Fe(II)] 
dt k[Fe(II)][OH-]' Po, (7-43)

k = rate constant 
= 8 (± 2.5) X 1013liter'f(atm.min.mole') at 20°C" 
Po, = partial pressure of oxygen, atm Iron Chemistry 383 
From this equation we can see that the rate of ferrous iron oxidation is 
first order with respect to oxygen and Fe2+ and second order with respect 
to OH-. 
The rate equation can be transformed to 
-d([Fe(II)J) = k[OH 'P = -d In [Fe'+] 
[Fe(II)] dt ] 0, dt 
For a constant partial pressure of oxygen we have 
-d In [Fe2+] 
dt k' [OH-]' = rate (7·44) 
Taking logarithms of both sides and substituting Kwf[H+] for [OH-] we 
have 
log (rate) = log k" + 2pH (7 ·45) 
A plot of log (rate) versus pH should give a straight line with a slope 
of 2. Figure 7·19 shows that this is indeed true for experimental data at 
pH 5.5 or above. At pH values below this the rate law appears to approach 
the form 
_--=dc.:l.::n",[F:.:e:.:'--,-+] =k, dt 
OI, when p~ is not a constant, 
(7·46) 
where k, = 1 X 10-25 (lfatm-min) at 25°C. This is an extremely slow rate 
of iron oxidation. Indeed, below pH 5.5 the rate is negligible (half-life of 
many years), so on this basis we conclude that, at this pH, Fe2+ is stable 
in oxygenated solutions. This conclusion is at odds with the known 
phenomenon of acid mine drainage in which pyrite (FeS",,) in mine waters 
is oxidized very rapidly to Fe3+ at pH values of 2 to 3. Such acid mine 
drainage gives rise to waters of low pH, high iron, high hardness, high 
TDS and with a brown-yellow color (Table 7-7).

The net result of these reactions is that 4 moles of pyrite are oxidized to 
produce 4 moles of Fe(OH)3('" which causes the yellow-brown discoloration 
of the water; 12 moles of H+ (strong acid) are produced which then react 
with calcareous minerals in the soil to give rise to waters that have a 
high hardness and high total dissolved solids content. Another reaction 
of importance in acid mine drainage is the oxidation of FeS"" by ferric 
iron (Fe3+). Stoichiometrically, this reaction is 
FeS"" + 14Fe3+ + SH20;;o: 15Fe2+ + 2S0. -+ ISH+ (7-50) 
These classical stoichiometric statements do not give a true picture of 
what is happening in acid mine drainage. A more accurate picture" is 
given by the scheme shown in Fig. 7-20. Some pyrite is oxidized by oxygen 
to produce Fe2+ and this in turn is oxidized by oxygen to Fe'+. The ferric 
ion may either precipitate as Fe(OH)3(" or be available to oxidize more 
FeS"" to Fe2+ by the reaction in Eq. 7-50. From our previous discussion 
it would appear that the rate-limiting step in this cyclical oxidation of 
pyrite would be the slow oxidation of Fe2+ at low pH. However, it has 
been shown that various microorganisms such as Thiobacillus thiooxi­
dans, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, and Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans, are able 
to catalyze the oxygenation of ferrous iron. Thiobacillus ferrooxidans 
catalyzes or mediates the redox reactions of Fe2+

Fig. 7 ~20. Mechanism of pyrite oxidation. 
The importance of microbial catalysis can be demonstrated by com­
paring the rate of Fe2+ oxidation in waters from a mine where acid mine 
drainage occurs with the rate in the same water that has been sterilized. 
The rate in the un sterilized water was shown to be about 10' times greater 
than in the sterilized water." From Fig. 7-20 we can deduce that once the 
pyrite oxidation cycle has started [i.e .• once a small amount of FeS"" has 
been oxidized by O,J further oxygen is only needed for the microbially 
catalyzed oxidation of Fe'+ to Fe3+. Further FeS"" is oxidized by Fe3+ 
according to Eq. 7-50. An ample supply of Fe3+ for this reaction is 
guaranteed because Fe(OH)3{,' precipitates generated by the reaction in 
Eq. 7-49 will be present right at the site of iron oxidation. 
The observations made above have an important bearing on the 
methods for controlling acid mine drainage. Sealing mines to keep out 
oxygen will not necessarily be successful for two reasons. Oxygen is only 
needed initially for FeS"" oxidation and the microorganisms that catalyze 
Fe'+ oxidation are microaerophiles. that is. they need only low levels of 
oxygen to survive. 
7.8. CHLORINE CHEMISTRY 
Chlorine is used widely in water and waste treatment both as an 
oxidizing agent and a disinfectant. As an oxidizing agent it is used for 
taste and odor control and color removal in municipal water treatment 
(oxidation of organics); it is used for oxidation of Fe(I1) and Mn(lI) in 
groundwater supplies; in industrial waste treatment it is employed for 
cyanide oxidation; in domestic waste treatment its uses include odor 
control. sulfide oxidation. ammonia removal, and disinfection. As a 
disinfectant it is used in municipal drinking water treatment and for 
wastewater disinfection. Chlorine is employed for slime or biofouling

control in industrial water treatment applications such as cooling towers 
and condensers. Also in a role that may be regarded as selective 
disinfection, or selective killing, chlorine is utilized for the control of 
filamentous microorganisms (bulking) in the activated sludge treatment 
of wastewater. Chlorine is also widel y used as a disinfectant in swimming 
pools. Some undesirable compounds may be formed under certain con­
ditions when chlorine reacts with organic matter as we will see in Section 
7.8.4. 
7.8.!. Forms of Aqueous Chlorine 
The term aqueous chlorine as it is used in water and wastewater 
treatment refers not only to the elemental chlorine species CI,. but also 
to a variety of other species including hypochlorous acid. HOC!. hypo­
chlorite ion, OCI-, and several chloramine species such as monochlor­
amine, NH,CI, and dichloramine, NHCI,. Chlorine is used (or applied) in 
several forms. At the present time it is most often used as a gas. CI"g), 
generated from the vaporization of liquid chlorine stored under pressure. 
A typical use is disinfection of potable water and wastewater. Salts of 
HOCI such as sodium hypochlorite or bleach, NaOCl, and calcium 
hypochlorite or HTH (high-test hypochlorite), Ca(OCI)" are also used. All 
these types of "chlorine" find use in swimming pool disinfection. In 
addition, organic chlorine~c;::ontaining compounds such as chlorinated 
cyanuric acid, 
CI h =c! "c=o I I CI-N N-CI 
"C/ 
~ 
which is stable in the presence of sunlight, are used for swimming pool 
disinfection. The chlorinated cyanuric acid will hydrolyze in solution to 
yield free chlorine." 
At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, CI, is a pale-green 
gas. It can be compressed at room temperatures to a yellow-green liquid. 
Both the gaseous and liquid chlorine react with water to become hydrated. 
Liquid chlorine forms the compound CI,'8H,O, "chlorine ice,"below 9.4'C.

7.8.2. Chlorine Equilibria 
As we have seen previously in the development of pE-pH diagrams, 
CI",q, reaels with water, with one atom being oxidized to CI( + I), the other 
being reduced to Cl( -I). This is often referred to as disproportionation. 
CI",q) + H20;;= HOCI + H+ + CI-; Kh = 4 X 10-4 (7-52)

H20 + ~CI",q);;= HOCI + H+ + e-
CI",q) + H20;;= HOCI + H+ + CI-
The HCI formed is completely dissociated under usual dilute aqueous 
solution conditions. Hypochlorous acid, on the other hand, is a relatively 
weak acid: 
pK, = 7.5 (7-53) 
From Eqs. 7-52 and 7-53 it is evident that the relative amount of the various 
oxidized chlorine species is a function of pH. 
From the 25°C pK, value it can be deduced that at pH 7.5 the activities 
{HOCI} and {OCI-} are equal. At pH values below 7.5, HOCI predominates 
while above pH 7.5, OCI-is the predominant species. This is of more 
than academic interest because the disinfecting ability of HOCI is 
generally regarded to be far greater than that of OCI-; HOCI is about 80 
to 100 times more effective at killing E. coli than is OCI-. 
We can illustrate the distribution of the various chlorine species with 
pH using a distribution diagram in which the fraction of the total aqueous 
chlorine that is a particular species (CI",q), HOCI, or OCI-) is plotted 
versus pH for a fixed CI-concentration. Figure 7 -21 is such a diagram for 
pH

previous diagrams in Figs. 7-4 and 7-6 (pE-pH and predominance area) 
have hinted: under typical natural water conditions, HOCI and OCI-are 
the major chlorine species. CI"M' is unimportant above pH 2. For com­
parison, Fig. 7-22 shows distribution diagrams for the other two halogens 
used as disinfectants (bromine and iodine). For bromine all three species 
(Br",q" HOBr and aBc) could conceivably be important species under 
natural water conditions. With iodine only I"", and HOI are important. 
The diagram for chlorine shows that in the pH range of natural waters 
(pH 6 to 9), the relative amounts of HOCI and OCI-are very sensitive to 
pH. As we have previously mentioned, HOCI and OCI-differ greatly in 
their disinfecting ability so that pH control can be a critical factor in 
determining the degree of disinfection achieved by a certain level of 
chlorine. ,

Example 7-12 
A chlorine dose of 1 mglliter as C12 satisfactorily disinfects a water at pH 7.0. 
What dose of chlorine would be required to achieve the same disinfection 
efficiency if the pH of the water was 8.5? Assume that HOCl is 100 times more 
effective as a disinfectant than OCl~ and that the temperature is 25°C. 
Solution 
From Fig. 7-21 at pH 7. 
lXCI2=O 
lXHOCI = 0.76 
lXOCI-= 0.24 
Since CT.CI ~ 1 mglliter as Cl,. HOCI ~ 0.76 mglliter as CI,. and OCI- ~ 0.24 mgl 
liter. 
The relative disinfection effectiveness. HOCI ~ 100. OCI- ~ 1.0. 
Disinfection effectiveness = concentration x relative disinfection effectiveness 
~ 0.76 x 100 + 0.24 x 1.0 
= 76 units per mg/liter of chlorine 
From Fig. 7-21 at pH 8.5. 
Q'e12 = 0 
(¥HOCI = 0.09 
t:¥OCI-= 0.91 
The disinfection effectiveness is 
~ 0.09 X 100 + 0.91 X 1.0 
= 9.9 units per mg/liter of chlorine 
To achieve the same effectiveness of disinfection at pH B.S, we would therefore 
need 76/9.9 ~ 7.7 times the dose applied at pH 7. 
7.B.3. Chlorine Reactions with Inorganic Species 
The form in which chlorine is added to a water affects some of the 
chemical properties of the water. The addition of chlorine gas to a water 
will lower its alkalinity because of the production of the strong acid and 
HOCI by the reaction in Eq. 7-52: However. if chlorine is dosed as a salt 
of hypochlorous acid: 
NaOCI--> Na+ + OCl-
and 
OCl-+ H,O ~ HOCI + OW 
there will be an increase in alkalinity to the extent that OCl-reacts with 
H,O. The use of calcium hypochlorite (HTH) increases both the alkalinity 
and the total hardness (Ca'+) of a water 
Ca(OC!), --> CaH + 20CI-
20Cl-+ 2H,O ~ 2HOCI + 20W Chlorine Chemistry 391 
These consic;lerations are important because they show that the form in 
which chlorine is added can affect the water chemistry in different ways. 
The addition of significant amounts of Cl"g, to a low alkalinity water 
could depress pH to an unacceptably low value. Bleach addition would' 
not cause such a pH depression. The use of HTH as a disinfectant in 
swimming pools is not to be recommended because the increase in 
hardness and alkalinity that accompanies its addition can aggravate 
scale (CaCO, precipitation) problems. 
I! we were to add (or dose) a water with a known amount of one or 
another of the forms of chlorine, and then after a time interval (contact 
time) were to analyze the water for chlorine (the chlorine residual), we 
would find less chlorine present than we added. We say that the water 
has a "chlorine demand," where after a certain contact time, 
chlorine demand = chlorine dose -chlorine residual 
The chlorine demand is the result of a va~iety of reactions in which 
chlorine is consumed by various constituents of the water and by 
decomposition. The reactions of chlorine with water constituents can be 
conveniently grouped into (I) those promoted by sunlight, (2) those with 
inorganic compounds, (3) those with ammonia, and (4) those with organic 
compounds. We will consider each of these types of reaction in this 
section as an illustration of the importance of kinetics and reaction 
mechanisms of redox reactions. 
1. Sunlight. Aqueous chlorine solutions are not stable when exposed to 
sunlight. Radiation in the ultraviolet region provides energy for the 
reaction of chlorine with water, 
2HOCI + 2W + 4e-~ 2Cl-+ 2H,O 
2H,O ~ 4H+ + 0, + 4e-
2HOCI ~ 2W + 2Cl-+ 0, . 
This reaction accounts for a major part of the chlorine consumption in 
outdoor swimming pools. It is the reaSOn why bleach is sold in opaque 
plastic bottles and it should be the reason that you should never buy 
bleach in a clear bottle "on sale" from your neighborhood supermarket. 
that is, unless you are interested in purchasing a bottle of salt solution. 
2. Reactions with Inorganics. The reactions between chlorine and re­
duced inorganic compounds (e.g., Mn(Il), Fe(l!), NO,-, S(-II)) are usually 
rapid. Thus when chlorine is used to oxidize ferrous iron to ferric iron, for 
example, in groundwater treatment. the reactions, 
Cl"", + 2Fe2+ ~ 2Fe3+ + 2Cl-
or 
HOCI + H+ + 2Fe'+ ~ 2Fe3+ + Cl-+ H,O 
proceed almost instantaneously at pH values near aI),d above neutrality. 1'1 
I

,"I' 392 Oxidation~Reduction Reactions 
If we were to conduct an experiment in which a ferrous iron solution 
Was dosed with increasing amounts of chlorine, we would obtain a plot 
of dosed chlorine versus residual chlorine like that in Fig. 7·23. No 
residual chlorine appears until all the Fe2+ has been oxidized to Fe'+. 
When this has taken place, chlorine residuals appear and the further 
dosing of chlorine results in the appearance of chlorine equal to the 
additional dose. Reactions of chlorine with S( -11), Mn(II), and NO, -all 
follow this pattern except that the reaction with Mn(II) only occurs at pH 
> 8.5. When present at high pH values, chlorine oxidation of sulfide tends 
to form polysulfides. It is a common complaint of operators of activated 
sludge plants that encounter partial nitrification that "It is impossible for 
me to maintain a chlorine residual." Almost without fail this is because 
of the presence of nitrite, NO,-, in the effluent that chlorine will oxidize 
to nitrate, NO,-. 
H,O + NO,-"" NO,-+ 2H+ + 2e-
2e-+ W + HOCI "" Cl-+ H,O 
HOCI + NO, -"" NO, -+ Cl-+ W 
Each mole of NO,-(46 g as NO,-or 14 g as N) oxidized requires I mole 
HOCI (52.5 g as HOCI or 71 g as CI,). Thus each mg NO,--Niliter will 
consume approximately 5 mglliter of HOCI as CI,. 
3. Reactions with Ammonia. The reactions of chlorine with ammonia 
and organic nitrogen are quite different from those of chlorine with other 
inorganic and organic compounds. Let us illustrate the situation with the 
most studied of these reactions-that between chlorine and ammonia. 
Simply stated, chlorine reacts with ammonia to produce a series of 
chlorinated ammonia compounds called chloramines (Table 7·8) and 
eventually oxidizes the ammonia to nitrogen gas (N ,(gJ or a variety of 
nitrogen·containing chlorine·free products (Table 7.9).

The reaction mechanism is complex, not completely understood, and 
the products vary with conditions such as the pH, ratio of Cl, add_ed to 
ammonia present, and contact time. 
Formation of the chloramines can be depicted as a stepwise process: 
NH",q) + HOCI "" NH,Cl + H,O 
NH,Cl + HOCI "" NHCl, + H,O 
NHCl, + HOCI "" NCl, + H,O 
These reactions are written here in terms of HOC!. but CI, may be used 
instead. Since 
Cl, + H,O "" HOCI + H+ + CI-
a mole of HOCI (or OCI-) can be used interchangeably on a mole-for­
mole basis with CI, in ordeLto determine the required dosage to achieve 
the reaction. 
The oxidation of ammonia to the various end products listed in Table 
7 -9 requires different amounts of chlorine per unit amount of ammonia­
nitrogen oxidized. These "Cl, reduced to NH,-N oxidized" ratios are 
given in Table 7-9 for each possible end product on both a molar and a 
weight basis. These ratios are calculated from the pertinent redox reaction 
stoichiometry. For example, the two most common end products of

The chlorine reduced to ammonia oxidized ratio, [CI,]/[NH3], is t = 1.5 on

The chlorine reduced to ammonia·oxidized mole ratio is 4, while on a 
weight basis the ratio is 4 X ft = 20.3. 
Chloramine formation and oxidation of ammonia by chlorine combine 
to create a unique dose·residual curve for the addition of chlorine to 
ammonia.containing solutions (Fig. 7·24). As the chlorine dose increases, 
the chlorine residual at first rises to a maximum at a [CI,] dose to [NH3] 
molar ratio of about 1.0. As the chlorine dose is increased further, the 
chlorine residual falls to a value close to zero. The chlorine dose 
corresponding to this minimum is called the "breakpoint" dose, and it 
occurs at a molar ratio of 1.5: I to 2: I. depending upon solution conditions. 
The primary reaction that causes the residual chlorine concentration to 
decrease and thus to form the breakpoint is the breakpoint reaction, 
which can be represented as 
or as 2NH,CI + HOCI "" N2(g, + 3H+ + 3CI-+ H,O

These tIre not mechanistic representations but they do account for the 
observed stoichiometry of 3 moles chlorine' per 2 moles of NH" If the 
observed stoichiometry is greater than 3:2 (or 1.5), the increase in dose 
can generally be attributed to the formation of some NO,-and/or NCl" 
An examination of the nature of the chlorine residual present prior to 
the breakpoint will reveal that it is composed almost entirely of chlora­
mines. In the jargon of water chemistry these are referred to as "combined 
chlorine residual" as opposed to Cl" OCI-, and HOCI which are known 
as "free chlorine residuals." 
As the chlorine dose is increased in excess of that required to produce 
the breakpoint. the increase in residual chlorine will be approximately 
equal to the excess. Il we were to examine the nature of the chlorine 
residual after the breakpoint. we would find that it is largely free chlorine 
with some combined chlorine. 
A more detailed examination of the types of chlorine residual would 
produce the picture presented in Fig. 7 -25. Prior to the breakpoint, 
monochloramine and dichloramine are produced (I.e., under the "hump" 
of chlorine residual). Following the breakpoint, free chlorine (HOCI and 
OCI-) predominate but some dichloramine and trichloramine may be in 
evidence. A similar plot for nitrogen-containing species (Fig. 7-26) shows 
that there is no free ammonia present at CI, dose to initial NH, molar 
ratios of greater than 1.0 and that nitrogen is not eliminated until the 
ratio is equal to or greater than 1.0. The figures further indicate that the 
chloramines increase in concentration up to a ratio of 1.0 and thereafter 
decrease. A reaction mechanism must therefore describe the formation 
of chloramines and their subsequent disappearance, and the formation 
of the known common oxidation products, nitrogen gas (N 2(g,) and nitrate 
(NO, -). Prior to examination of such a mechanistic model for the breakpoint 
chlorination of ammonia, let us look at the rates of some of the important 
constituent reactions.

with a rate constant of 5.1 x 10' liter/mole-sec. The reaction is first order 
with respect to both HOCI and NH3 and second order overall. Since the 
reaction occurs between HOCI and NH",q), pH can be expected to exert 
a dramatic effect on the reaction rate. Lowering the pH from 9 to 8 will 
increase [HOC1], (pK, = 7.5), and decrease [NH",q)], (pK, = 9.3); raising pH 
from the range for optimum reaction rate will decrease [HOC1] and 
increase [NH3(,q,j. Because of this influence of pH on the speciation of 
reactants, the reaction rate can be written in terms of the dissociation

The a values at a particular pH can be determined from the mass balances

Figure 7-27 shows the variation of the rate of monochloramine formation 
as a function of pH. 
The back reaction in Eq .. 7-56--decomposition of monochloramine to 
NH, and HOCI-is considerably slower than the forward reaction. It is an 
elementary reaction with a rate constant of 3 x 10-5 sec-1.16 Th.e ratio of

about two orders of magnitude less than for NHCI, and NH,C!. The rate 
of NCI3 formation increases significantly as the pH decreases below pH 
3 because of the presence of CI2taQ), which is about 104 times more reactive 
toward NHCI, than is HOC!. NCI3 decomposes by hydrolysis to NHCI, at 
pH values greater than 7, with the decomposition rate increasing rapidly 
as pH increases in the range 7 to 9. Sanguinsin and Morris 17 found that

by OH-or reaction of the NCI3 with OH-. They also found that NCI3 would 
react with NH3 and thereby be removed from solution. 
Because of the effect of pH on the formation of chloramine, pH has a 
profound effect on the species of combined chlorine that make up the 
"hump" of the breakpoint curve. At pH 7 and above, essentially only 
NH,CI is present, while below 7, significant amounts of NHCI, are found, 
particularly at mole ratios between I: I and the breakpoint." NHCI, at 
mole ratios less than I: I is favored only below a pH of approximately 5. 
NCl3 will not appear in significant quantities under the "hump" unless 
the pH is of the order of 4 or lower. 
The mechanism of the breakpoint reaction is, as yet, unresolved. The 
most comprehensive model is that of Wei and Morris" who proposed a 
scheme consisting of reactions that formed chloramines; reactions that 
converted chloramines into a hypothetical intermediate, NOH; and reo 
actions by which NOH decomposed to form N, and N03 -(Table 7·10). 
Saunier and Selleck" examined this model and experimentally deter· 
mined the rate constants for each of the reactions in Table 7·10. They 
concluded that the model fits "breakpoint chlorination results. They 
suggested, but did not prove, that hydroxylamine (NH,OH) and possibly 
hydrazine (N,H,) could be intermediates in the breakpoint reaction­
perhaps the hypothetical NOH of Wei and Morris.

7.8.4. Chlorine Reactions with Organic Substances 
Chlorine at concentrations used for water and wastewater treatment 
readily reacts with organic compounds in the water. In some reactions, 
such as those with organic nitrogen compounds and phenols. Cl is 
substituted for a hydrogen atom. thus producing the chlorinated com· 
pound. Chlorine can also be incorporated into a molecule by addition 
reactions, or it may react with a compound to oxidize it without chlori· 
nating it. Although some of the chlorinated organics that form during the 
chlorination of natural and wastewaters are known. many still remain to 
be identified. 
1. Reactions with Organic Nitrogen. Chlorine reacts readily with many 
organic nitrogen compounds just as it does with ammonia. The organic 
amines. which have the group -NH,. -NH-, or -N= as part of their 
molecule. are very common. The elementary reaction with methylamine, 
CH3NH" is typical 
HOCI + CH3NH, --> CH3NHCl + H,O 
The rate constant for this reaction, k = 108·S6liter/mole·sec, is higher than 
that found for formation of NH,CI." Also, the formation of dichlorometh· 
ylamine, 
HOCI + CH3NHCl .... CH3NCl, + H,O 
is acid catalyzed just as is the formation of dichloramine from mono· 
chloramine. Analysis of other similar reactions showed that as the base 
strength of the amine (indicated by the basicity constant K b) increased, 
the rate of the reaction with HOCI increased. Amides, compounds in 
which the group -oCNH, or -oCNH- is incorporated, behave in a 
similar fashion to the amines but do not react as rapidly because they 
are not as basic.

The reaction of chlorine with organic nitrogen is important because it 
exerts a demand, that is, it requires that more chlorine be added to 
achieve a given level of disinfection. The chlorine attached to the nitrogen 
has not in all cases lost its capacity to oxidize, but it is generally not as 
potent an oxidant as HOCI or NH,CI. Some chlorinated organic nitrogen 
compounds react as residual chlorine, along with HOC\, OCI-, NH,CI, 
and so forth, in the various analytical procedures for residual chlorine. 
2. Reactions with Phenols. Chlorine readily substitutes on to phenol, 
@-OH, and compounds containing the phenolic group. Because these 
compounds can be present in water supplies resulting from industrial 
discharges or natural decay processes, and because several of the 
chlorinated phenols are very odorous, their formation has long been a 
concern of water treatment plant operators. A typical reaction between 
HOCI and phenol is shown in Fig. 7-28. The threshold odor numbers of 
each chlorinated species indicating the concentrations that will just 
produce a detectable odor are also shown. The amount of any species 
present at a given time depends upon pH, chlorine dose, phenol concen­
tration, and temperature.22 Predicted threshold odor versus time curves 
that show the effect of reactant concentration and pH are presented in 
Fig. 7-29. The curves give an indication of the parameters which can be 
changed to control a chlorophenol odor problem.

CHX3 where X can be Ct Br, or I. CHCI3, chloroform, is of particular 
interest because it is a suspected carcinogen. The health effects of the

at high pH than at low pH.

is of concern during water treatment. The major source of these groups 
appears to be in the so-called humic substances. which were discussed 
in Section 5-7. 
Many treated waters contain not only chloroform but other chlorinated 
and brominated trihalomethanes such as CHCl,Br. CHCIBr,. and CHBr,. 
These brominated species form because aqueous chlorine converts Br-.-' 
ion in the water to HOBr. The bromine compounds then react with the 
organic matter in the same way as HOCI. 24 If 1-is also present in the 
water. presumably HOCI will also oxidize it and the product will react 
similarly to HOCI. producing additional trihalomethanes species. Di­
chloroiodomethane is one of the species commonly observed. 
4. Addition and Oxidation Reactions. Chlorine can undergo an addition 
reaction if the organic compound has a double bond.

For many compounds with double bonds. this reaction is too slow to be 
of importance in water treatment." However. more must be learned of the 
characteristics of some of the substances that are found in water before 
we can be certain that this will always be the case. 
Chlorine can also oxidize· organic compounds as follows:

The oxidation reaction with a carbohydrate (e.g .. lactose) or with a fat 
or fatty acid such as oleic acid is generally quite slow. The organic 
compound is eventually converted to CO, and H,O. The reactions are 
generally far too slow to be considered significant in the context of the 
reaction times involved in various chlorination practices. The dose· 
residual curves presented in Fig. 7-30 represent the slow progress of the

7.9. BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT REDOX REACTIONS 
Many of the phenomena encountered in natural waters and many of 
the processes that make up wastewater treatment are due to redox 
reactions that are catalyzed (or mediated) by biological systems, for 
example, bacteria, algae, and other microorganisll!s. It is important to 
realize that microorganisms, like inanimate objects, must obey the laws 
of thermodynamics. One might wonder about this statement in view of 
the well·known observation that photosynthetic organisms have the 
ability to synthesize organic matter frpm CO, and Hp-a reaction that 
is not thermodynamically spontaneous. However, it must be realized that 
photosynthetic organisms must have an input of energy (sunlight) to drive 
the reaction. They are able to mediate a reaction that goes in the opposite 
direction to thermodynamic predictions only because they have devised 
a means of capturing energy from an external source and using it to 
reverse the internal energy gradient of the system. Because photosynthetic 
organisms are active in most natural waters and in some waste treatment 
systems we must be careful in some calculations, to treat them as steady. 
state open systems with an energy input from a source external to the 
system, rather than as closed systems. 
Microorganisms (or any other organisms) do not perform chemical 
reactions, they catalyze them and use them for purposes such as deriving Biologically Important Redox Reactions 405 
energy for metabolic processes or source materials for biosynthesis. 
Nevertheless the importance of the microbial catalysis of redox reactions 
cannot be stressed enough. We have already seen that the production of 
acid mine drainage is made possible by the microbial catalysis of an 
oxidation that in the absence of microorganisms would proceed very 
slowly if at all. In this section we will examine the reactions of the 
nitrogen cycle, the sequence of the use of various electron acceptors in 
biological systems, and the relationship between the amount of energy 
obtained from. redox reactions by microorganisms and the amount of cell 
material (yield) that they can produce. 
7,9; L The Nitrogen Cycle 
The way in whiCh nitrogen circulates on the earth's surface and in its 
atmosphere is usually depicted as the nitrogen-cycle (Fig. 7-31). Many of 
the reactions in the nitrogen cycle are microbially catalyzed redox 
reactions. These are the oxidation of NH, + to NO, -and then to N03-
(nitrification), the reduction of N03-to NO,-and then to NH,+ (nitrate 
reduction), the reduction of N03·-to N"" (denitrification), and the reduction 
of N"g, to NH, + (nitrogen fixation). The incorporation of NH, + into nitrogen­
containing organic matter (ami nation) or its release (deamination or 
ammonification) is the only nonreclox reaction involving a nitrogen 
transformation in the entire nitrogen cycle. 
The various redox reactions of inorganic nitrogen containing species 
are presented in Table 7·1. These reactions Can be used to construct a pC-

nitrogen concentration of 10-' M (CT,N = 10-' = 2[N"",] + [NH, +] +

is approximately in equilibrium with an atmosphere containing a partial 
pressure of 0.77 atm of N"g,-the typical N"g, content of the normal surface 
earth's atmosphere (Fig. 7·32), Marked on the pE axis is the pE value of 
water in equilibrium with an atmosphere containing 0,21 atm of 0, at pH 
8 (pE = + 12,5) and the PE value estimated for the interior of a photosynthetic 
cell (pE = -7,0 to -7,5, estimated from the pE of the reaction in which CO, 
is converted to glucose). 
Since all of the major nitrogen·containing species, NH, +, N",q, and NO,­
have regions of predominance within the pE range over which microbially 
catalyzed reactions can occur, it would be expected that their intercon­
version would be rapid, Moreover, one would predict from Fig, 7-32 that, 
in oxygenated water at pH 8, all dissolved nitrogen gas should be 
converted to NO, -. If this were indeed the case, then the earth's atmosphere 
would be virtually devoid of N"g, and NO, -would be a major aqueous 
species. We know that neither of these predictions are accurate, since 
the earth's atmosphere contains PN, = 0.77 atm and nitrate is a very minor 
component of natural water. The disparity between prediction and ob­
servation stems from the slowness and complexity of reactions involving 
N"g" Nitrogen gas consists of two atoms of nitrogen joined by a triple 
bond (N N). The other nitrogen-containing species in the nitrogen cycle 
all contain one nitrogen atom, Therefore, to form NO, -, NO, -, or NH,+ 
from N",q, or N"g" the very strong N=N bond must be broken. Because of Biologically Important Redox ReQ(~tions 407 
this the rate of these reactions is quite slow. However, the conversion of 
N, to NH, + does take place in organisms that fix N".,: 
pE" = +4.68 
Since this reaction, at pH 8, is only spontaneous below pE "" -6, it is 
necessary for the microorganisms to generate a highly reducing locaL 
environment (such as that produced by photosynthesis) to drive the 
nitrogen fixation reaction. Such environments exist in the interior of 
photosynthetic cells including the blue.green algae that fix nitrogen (e.g" 
Microcystis, Anabaena, Aphanizomenon) and in the symbiotic association 
in root nodules between bacteria of the genus Rhizobium and certain 
leguminous plants. 
Denitrification [the conversion of N03 -to N2{aq)] is a common reaction 
catalyzed by many bacteria and proceeds rapidly. However, it appears 
that microbial catalysts are unable to catalyze the reverse of the denitri· 
fication reaction (N",q, -> NO,-). 
From this discussion it is evident that reactions involving the conversion 
of N",q, to NH,+ or NO,-proceed slowly. However, it is a well.supported 
observation that the i:n:terconversion of the other nitrogen.containing 
species of the nitrogen cycle proceeds relatively easily and quite rapidly. 
Because of these observations it is profitable to redraw the pC'PE diagram 
for CT.N = 10-' and pH 8, omitting N",q, and N".,. This is tantamount to 
converting the system from an open system in contact with an atmosphere 
containing N2(y) to a closed system in which N2{y) and therefore N2(aq) is 
absent. Such a diagram is drawn in Fig. 7 ·33. It shows that NH, +, NO,­
and NO, -are all major species in the very narrow pE range from +4.5 to 
+6.2. Such a presentation is consistent with the observation that these 
species are easily and rapidly interconvertible (by nitrification and nitrate 
reduction). Also note that the pE region over which NO, -is the predominant 
species is extremely narrow. This is consistent with the observation that 
N02 ~ is a transitory species in natural waters and waste treatment 
processes-it only exists in significant quantities over a very narrow pE 
range and it is readily interconverted to NO,-and NH,+. 
7.9.2. Electron Acceptors in Microbial Systems 
It is common in waste treatment practice and in water pollution control 
to classify environments or processes as either "aerobic" or "anaerobic." 
These gross classifications are usually made on the basis of whether or 
not dissolved oxygen is present in the water or wastewater. Aerobic 
systems are those in which oxygen is present, and anaerobic environments 
are those in which oxygen is absent. It is observed that the chemical 
reactions that take place and the types of organisms that predominate 
are different in aerobic and anaerobic systems. A closer examination of 
natural waters and waste treatment processes r!Oveals that the dividing ,

line between aerobic and anaerobic environments is not sharply drawn. 
To say that a water or process was aerobic would be tantamount to 
stating that in the aerobic system the redox conditions are controlled by 
the reaction 
O"g, + 4H+ + 4e---> 2H,O; PEO = 20.8 
whereas in the anaerobic environment (oxygen absent) the redox condi­
tions are controlled by another reaction. When we examine which "other" 
reactions are likely candidates for controlling the redox environment of 
anaerobic processes, we find that there are many. Table 7-11 lists these 
reactions in the order of descending PEo values. 
Microorganisms use these reduction reactions to consume the electrons 
generated by the oxidation of their energy-yielding substrate. Although 
this substrate can be any of a variety of substances, let us take for an 
example the oxidation of formaldehyde (CH,O) to CO, and H,O by the 
reaction: 
CO"g, + 4H+ + 4e-~ CH,O + H,O; PEO = -1.20 
This reaction can be coupled with anyone of the electron accepting 
(reduction) reactions listed in Table 7-11. From the t1Go values of these 
coupled reactions it can be deduced that the amount of free energy that 
a microorganism can obtain from the coupled redox reactions listed in 
Table 7-11 is in direct proportion to its PEo value. I Biologically Important Redox Reactioris 409

This trend is supported by many observations in natural waters and '1 
waste treatment systems. It is generally supported by the observation 
that "anaerobic" communities cannot develop in oxic (or oxygen-contain­
ing) environments. Using' the same substrate, the anaerobic organisms 
cannot get as much energy per mole by its oxidation as can the aerobic 
organism. Therefore, they cannot grow as fast as the aerobes and they 
become overgrown. Some anaerobes, such as the methane fermenters, 
are poisoned by oxygen. In' this general sense, the redox conditions of a 
water determine the type of biological community that develops. The 
effect is not always as dramatic as indicated, since many organisms­
the so-called facultative aerobes-have the ability to use both oxygen 
and nitrate as electron acceptors. They only use nitrate when the 
concentration of dissolved oxygen is very low, for the simple reason that 
they do not get as much energy per mole out of doing so. Greenwood" 
has found that, for soil bacteria, the concentration of dissolved oxygen 
in contact with the bacteria must fall to about 4 X 10-6 M (corresponding 
to an atmosphere containing 0.3 percent 0,) before the use of nitrate as 
an electron accepter starts. Horstkotte et a!. 27 found that dentrification of 
nitrate ion in a secondary effluent would proceed in a biofilm when the 
solution concentration of dissolved oxygen was approximately I mg/liter 
(-3.5 x 10-5 M). 
When nitrate is utilized, the reaction to produce N"" (denitrification) is 
favored over the reduction of NO, -through NO, -to NH, + (nitrate reduction) 
for the same reason: it yields more usable energy to the organism that 
catalyzes it. For example, in a nitrifying activated sludge plant, there is 
26 D. J. Greenwood, "Nitrification and Nitrate Dissimilation in Soil. Part 2. Effect 
of Oxygen Concentration," Plant and Soil, 17: 365-378 (1962). 
27 G. A. Horstkotte. D. G. Niles, D. S. Parker, and D. H. Caldwell, "Full Scale 
Testing of a Water Reclamation System," J. Water Pollut. Control Fed., 46:

usually dissolved oxygen and nitrate present in the aeration basin. When 
the .activated sludge settles in the secondary sedimentation basin, a 
sludge blanket forms in which high concentrations of activated sludge 
continue to respire, using electron acceptors. If the sludge is maintained 
in this quiescent, unmixed and unaerated, blanket for an extended period 
of time, all of the dissolved oxygen will be consumed. Then some of the 
microorganisms in the activated sludge (those that have the enzyme, 
nitrate reductase) will turn to the nitrate for an electron acceptor. 
Denitrification (not nitrate reduction) will occur with the accompanying 
production of the sparingly soluble N2(g)' Small bubbles of N"g) are 
produced within the activated sludge blanket (possibly within the acti­
vated sludge floc itself), and they rise to the surface of the secondary 
sedimentation basin, carrying with them particles of activated sludge 
which are more often than not carried over into the secondary effluent. 
This is the vexing problem of "blanket rising" or "sludge rising." In this 
example the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate (nitrification) and denitrifi­
cation occur in the same process with the only difference being environ­
ments where dissolved oxygen is present or absent. 
There are other such examples. Many unsaturated soils are known to 
convert NH. + to N2(g) via N03 -(Le., nitrification then denitrification). They 
achieve this because there are local oxic and anoxic environments in the 
soil waters that, respectively, allow nitrification and denitrification to 
proceed. In stratified lakes, nitrification may occur in the oxygenated 
epilimnion (upper layer) and denitrification in the hypolimnion (bottom 
water) and in the sediment pore water where dissolved oxygen concen­
trations fall to zero. The nitrification and denitrification process is im­
portant in preserving the fishery in Indian Creek Reservoir in the Sierra 
Nevada mountains. This reservoir is fed by the tertiary effluent from the 
City of South Lake Tahoe sewage treatment plant. The effluent has at 
times contained 15 to 20 mg NH,+-Nlliter. Levels of ammonia of this 
magnitude are toxic to fish, yet in the reservoir there is a thriving fishery. 
This is achieved because the top waters of the lake nitrify the ammonia 
to nitrate and this is reduced to N2(g) by the anoxic bottom waters. The 
summer concentrations of nitrogen species of the reservoir28 are approx­
imately 4 mg N03--Nlliter and 4 mg NH.-Nlliter. 
When domestic wastewater is treated by chemical precipitation fol­
lowed by carbon adsorption, one of the problems encountered is that the 
carbon columns become highly odorous. The odor derives from the 
reduction of SO/-to HS-by microorganisms growing within the carbon 
column on biodegradable adsorbed organic matter. This is the sulfate­
reduction reaction. Attempts to alleviate the situation by injecting air 
into the columns have met with little success because the oxidation of 
sulfide by oxygen is not always a rapid process, especially if the sulfides

are present in a particulate form. One successful method of preventing 
the sulfide odor has been to feed sodium nitrate to the carbon column 
influent. In the presence of NO,-, sulfide generation ceases because the 
microorganisms would rath~r reduce NO,-to N",) than SO.'-to HS-, since 
they get far more energy out of it (Table 7-12). The data in Table 7 -12 are 
from work conducted by Directo et aJ." in which both oxygen and chlorine 
were unsuccessfully used to eliminate sulfides from carbon column 
effluents. The successful use' of nitrate for preventing sulfide 'production 
in the columns is clearly evident. 
In Table 7-Il' the electron ac_ceptpnce reaction with the lowest energy 
yield for microorganisms is the reduction of CO'{g) to methane, the so­
called methane fermentation reaction. The reaction occurs only under 
strictly anaerobic conditions and the organisms ,using the reaction grow 
ve,ry slowly compared with aerobic heterotrophic bacteria because they 
obtain so little energy per mole of substrate reduced. When the methane 
fermentation reaction occurs, we can predict from Table 7 -Il that SO.'­
will be absent having been completely reduced to sulfide. Using this 
observation and the knowledge that many toxic heavy metals form 
insoluble sulfides, Lawrence and McCart),,· derived an ingenious tech­
nique for detecting the presence of potentially harmful concentrations of 
toxic metals in the sludge. fed to anaerobic sl)ldge digestion units at

tration (PH",) in the digester gas. With a normal (nontoxic level of metals 
in the digesting sludge, the PH,s value will be constant and can be

the digester, more metal sulfide solids will form and the concentrations 
of S2-, HS-and H2S"q, will decrease. These will be accompanied by a fall 
in PH,S' since its concentration is determined by [H2S"q,j. By determining 
the acceptable range of P",s levels in the digester gas, therefore, an early 
warning system for toxic levels of heavy metals is available. 
7.9.3. Microbial Yields 
In the previous section we saw how microorganisms use or become 
established to use electron-acceptance reactions strictly in the order of 
the amount of energy per mole of electrons consumed that they can derive 
from them. The amount of energy available to a microorganism is, 
ho,,":ever, a function of both the electron-generating (oxidation) half­
reaction and the electron-acceptance (reduction) reaction. Organisms that 
oxidize organic matter (CH20) all the way to CO2 and H20 (respiration) 
obtain more energy per mole than do organisms that only take "CH20" 
as far as, for example, formic acid (an example of a fermentation reaction). 
The pE values for the following equations illustrate this: 
CO2 + 4H+ + 4e---> CH20 + H20; 
HCOO-+ 3W + 2e---> CH20 + H20; PEO = -1.20 
PEo = +2.82 
Organisms that use substrates with lower energy content for energy 
generation produce even less energy per mole of substrate oxidized. 
The result of the various combinations of redox couples used by different 
microorganisms for energy generation, is that the amount of energy 
available per mole of substrate for processes such as the biosynthesis of 
new cell material varies widely from organism to organism. Expressed 
in microbial terms, we say that the yield (g cell material per g substrate r 
I 
i Biologically Important Redox Reactions 413 
consumed) varies widely. McCarty" has related cell yield for various 
microorganisms to the amount of free energy produced by coupled 
SUDstrate oxidation and electron-accepting reduction reactions. Some of 
his data are plotted in Fig. 7·35. The plot shows that nitrifying organisms 
have cell yields on the order of 0.1 cell equivalents/equivalent of electrons 
transferred in the substrate oxidation/electron acceptance reaction. These 
microorganisms oxidize ammonia to nitrite and reduce carbon dioxide to 
their cell material. The free energy change for this reaction is -13.4 kcal!

foI'a heterotrophic aerobic microorganism oxidizing fructose to CO, and

this redox couple is -28.7 kcal per electron mole. 
Not only does the amount of cell material that a microorganism can 
produce per unit amount of substrate processed vary with the energy 
available from the redox reaction that the microorganism catalyzes, but 
also the maximum rate at which various microorganisms can grow is 
related to the available energy. Table 7-13 shows typical growth rates of 
microorganisms growing under various redox conditions. The maximum 
growth rates are quite clearly related to tlie amount of energy available 
to the microorganisms from substrate oxidation. . 
7,10. ELECTROCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS 
The properties of electrochemical cells allow us tQ use them in a variety 
of ways for determining the concentrations of individual ions on physical­
chemical properties. We will not deal with all types a'f electrochemical 
measurements here; rather we will select examples to illustrate the use 
of electrochemical techniques in water chemistry. Our examples will 
include the measurement of activity (concentration) by potentiometric 
methods using galvanic cells and specific ion electrodes, and the meas­
urement of activity (concentration) by electrolytic cells using techniques 
such as polarography and amperometric titration.

where "ox" and "red" indicate "oxidized" and "reduced" species, respec­

reduced species are factors in determining the potential of an electrode. 
We can turn this fact to use by measuring the potential of an electrode 
at several known activities of reacting species, and then using the 
potential/activity relationship to determine the activities in unknown 
solutions from potential measurements of these solutions. If we wish to 
achieve this objective for the measurement of a single species or a single 
ion activity, we have several hurdles to overcome. 
First, the measuring instrument, or indicator electrode, must only 
respond to the activity of one component of the reaction taking place at 
the electrode; this means that the other components of the reaction must r

be kept constant. Second, the response of the electrode must be specific 
to the activity of the ion or species being measured; that is, the electrode 
must be highly selective. Third, the so-called indicator electrode must be 
made part of an electrochemical cell with another electrode-the reference 
electrode-whose potential remains constant over the range of conditions 
in which the cell is used. 
The indicator electrode and the reference electrode are joined externally 
through a voltmeter (potentiometer) that is of the type which draws very 
little current because it has near-infinite internal resistance. Because 
there is little current the reaction at the indicator electrode does not shift 
perceptibly from equilibrium and there is no significant consumption of 
the species of interest at the electrode. The internal contact between the 
indicator and reference electrodes is through a salt bridge or liquid 
junction that allows the passage of ions but does not permit significant 
mixing of solutions. The potential of the cell is 
Ecell = Ereference electrode + Elndicator electrode-+ EJunction 
whereEJunction is the potential across the liquid junction. The Ereference electrode 
and E,"","on are designed to be virtually constant so that ideally

where 
constant = Ereference electrode + EjunCllon 
and 
o HT {red} 
Elndlcatorelectrode =E -nFln {ox} 
If we can keep one of the reaction component activities constant at the 
indicator electrode, we can use the cell to measure the activity of the 
other component. For example, consider the electrode reaction 
EO = 0.799 volt 
With a silver metal electrode, {Ag(,,} is virtually constant and is taken as 
unity. 
Substituting into Eq. 7·60, we find 
HT E ,," = constant + 0.799 + nF In {Ag+} 
If the activity is approximately equal to the concentration, then 
E"" = constant + 0.799 + 0.059 log [Ag+] 
and the potential of the cell is a logarithmic function of [Ag+]. For every 
tenfold change (decade) in [Ag+] concentration, the potential will change 
0.059 volt (V) or 59 millivolts (m V). This type of response, that is, the 
change in m V reading per concentration decade can be used to judge 
whether an indicator electrode is behaving in an ideal or a "Nernstian" 
fashion. 
2. Calomel Electrode. The normal hydrogen electrode [a platinum wire 
in 1.288 N HCI solution ({H+} = 1) with H2(g, at I atm pressure bubbling 
through it] was used to define the standard electrode potential scale (see 
Section 7.3.2). This electrode is not convenient to use on an everyday 
basis, so a series of secondary reference electrodes has been developed 
for this purpose. One of the most commonly used laboratory reference 
electrodes is the saturated calomel electrode. The electrode (Fig. 7·36) 
consists of a platinum wire set in a paste that is a mixture of mercury 
(Hg(f))' mercurous chloride (calomel, Hg,CI2(,'), and potassium chloride 
(KC!). The paste is in contact with a solution that is saturated with KCI 
and Hg ,CI"". The electrode can be represented as 
HgiHg,CI,.,,,, KCI",(4.2M) 
The salt bridge or liquid junction between the saturated KCliHg,CI, 
solution and the solution being measured can be made through a capillary 
tube filled with asbestos fibers (Fig. 7·36). The potential of the saturated 
calomel electrode is determined by the reaction

and is +0.244 volt at 25°C. Since both Hg,CI"" and Hg'fI have unit activity 
the potential of the electrode can be written 
E = E' -~ In {CI-}, 
and since {CI-} is constant (the KCI solution is saturated), the potential 
of the electrode should be constant at a given temperature, that is,

finds use in the field measurement of potential in applications such as 
corrosion control. The electrode is sturdily constructed with a wood outer 
case and a screw connection for a liquid junction made from a porous 
plug. To satisfy yourself that the electrode is in working order you merely 
shake it to hear if you can detect the rattle of the CuSO"" crystals in the 
internal CuS04 solution. If they are present, the CuSO, solution will be 
saturated. 
4. Glass Electrode. Three indicator electrodes are discussed to illustrate 
the various types of construction and modes of operation of these 
electrodes. The glass electrode (Fig. 7-37) consists of a bulb of thin glass 
(a glass membrane) that is sensitive to changes in H+ activity. The inside 
of the glass membrane contains a reference solution of fixed [H+] , usually 
a 0.1 M HCl solution into which is immersed an internal reference 
electrode (usually Ag/AgCl). The glass membrane separates the internal. 
constant {H+} solution from the test solution of variable {H+}; see Fig. 7-
37. The potential of the glass electrode appears to develop because of an 
ion exchange reaction that takes place at the glass surface. Hydrogen 
ions selectively exchange at the glass surface, allowing charges to be 
transported through the glass, thereby determining the potential differ­
ence between the constant internal {H+} and the variable external {H+}. 
Ion exchange only takes place satisfactorily when the glass electrode 
surface is hydrated. Therefore, glass electrodes must be "conditioned" by 
soaking in dilute acid prior to use. When the glass electrode is made part 
of a galvanic cell with a reference electrode, such as the saturated 
calomel electrode, the measured potential of the cell is as indicated in 
Fig. 7-38 between A and E. The potential of interest is between C and D. 
The potentials between A and B and between Band C are constant 
because the internal reference solution concentration is constant. The 
potential between D and E is approximately constant. Its variation over 
a wide range of {H+} is minimized by "standardizing" the electrode 
system at {H+} levels that are close to those which are anticipated in the 
test solutions to be measured. This process of standardization leads to 
the operational definition of pH. We recall that pH is defined !llathemat-
icallyas -
pH c= -log {W} 
where {H+} is the activity of the H+ ion. 
It is not possible to measure this or any other single ion activity 
absolutely because single ions cannot be isolated in solution nor can 
potential measurements be obtained from one electrode in isolation. This Electrochemical Measurements 419

leads to the need for an operational definition of activity and concentration 
as determined from electrochemical measurements.

electrode system in it. The dial of the pH meter (which is basically a high. 
resistance voltmeter with a scale that has been converted to read in pH 
units instead of millivolts) is set to read the indicated pH of the buffer. 
The process is repeated with another buffer solution with a different pH. 
The first buffer is reread and the meter readjusted. The technique is 
repeated until the meter reads the indicated pH of both buffers. By this 
technique we have "dialed in" the value of constantlO.OS9 for the pH range 
of interest so that the value of Eoe,,/0.OS9 will be directly proportional to 
the pH. 
5. Divalent Cation Electrode. The divalent cation electrode for hard· 
ness is a selective ion electrode that detects Ca2+ and Mg2+ and other 
divalent ions in much the same way that the glass electrode detects H+. 
Instead of developing a potential across a glass membrane, it develops 
a potential over an inert porous disc that is saturated with a water· 
immiscible, liquid ion exchanger which is selective for divalent ions,

espeCially Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Figure 7-39)_ Theinternal solution is a calcium 
chloride solution saturated with the ion exchanger. There is an internal 
Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The liquid ion exchanger is, for example, 
the sparingly soluble calcium salt of dodecyl phosphoric acid dissolved 
in a di-n-octyl phenyl phosphonate and immobilized in a cellulose 
membrane. The calcium dodecyl phosphoric acid transports Ca2+ ions 
across the membrane and is responsible for establishing the potential of 
the electrode. Because the dodecyl phosphoric acid-Ca2+ salt is sparingly 
soluble, some Ca2+ ion is in solution in equilibrium with it so that the 
electrode potential reaches a plateau value at [CaHJ = 10-'. This 
particular electrode responds to ions other than Ca2+ and Mgu, ions that. 
may be regarded as interferences. The degree of interference is expressed 
by the selectivity constant Kx, where Kx is defined by the equation

of pH depends on the [Ca'+] + [Mg2+] concentrations and varies from 
about 6.5 at 10-5 M divalent cation to about 5 at 10-1 M. The upper bound 
is about pH 10 and is set by the presence of the MgOH+ ion, which is not 
detected by the electrode. 
6. Oxidation-Reduction Potential. The measurement of the so-called 
"oxidation reduction potential" (ORP) of natural waters, wastewaters, and 
waste treatment systems has been advanced by some wor)<ers as a useful 
index of the state of the system (i.e .. aerobic or anaerobic) or the degree 
of treatment (i.e., extent of biological oxidation of organics in wastewater). 
The measurement of ORP has found use in nonbiological situations such 
as the control of chlorination and dechlorination of sewage effluents. The 
oxidation-reduction potential is measured in a galvanic cell consisting 
of a reference electrode (e.g., calomel) and an indicating electrode of a 
highly noble metal (e.g., platinum or gold). The calomel electrode is the 
cathode and the inert platinum or gold electrode is the anode. The anode 
is made of a highly noble metal so that the potential for its oxidation is 
less than that of any oxidizable solution components. The anode thus is 
a site of the oxidation of solution constituents but ideally is not affected 
itself. 
Oxidation-reduction potential measurements in natural waters and 
wastewaters are difficult to interpret. The only potentials that will register 
in the ORP cell are those from species that can react at the indicator 
electrode surface-we call these electroactive species. In natural waters 
only a few reactions proceed at the electrode surface, for example, 
and Mn(IV) ¢ Mn2+ + 2e-
All the important redox reactions involved in the nitrogen cycle, the sulfur 
cycle, and the carbon cycle are not completed at the indicator electrode 
in an ORP cell. At best, ioo, the voltage reading produced by an ORP cell 
is a reflection of many reactions-it is a "mixed potential" and its value 
is difficult if not impossible to interpret in any fundamental chemical 
terms. Moreover, when an ORP electrode combination is immersed in a 
water the voltage reading will vary with time, usually falling from the 
initial reading obtained. This behavior is due to the general process of 
polarization and of "poisoning" of the indicator electrode surface by the 
accumulation of oxidation products on the surface of the electrode. 
Despite all of these limitations ORP measurements have been used 
widely in biological systems where, if they are treated as indices or 
"black box measurements" rather than fundamental indicators of a 
specific chemical environment, they can be of qualitative use. 
7.10.2. Amperometric (polarographic) Measurements 
As the name implies, amperometric techniques involve the measure­
ment of current. The term polarography derives from the fact that the 
electrode at which the reaction of interest occurs is in a polarized Electrochemical Measurements 423 
condition. The polarization of an electrode occurs when the products of 
a reaction that occurs at it accumulate to such an extent that they limit 
the rate of reaction at the electrode. When an electrode is in such a 
polarized condition, we can visualize that the concentration of the product 
of the electrode reaction is very .high close to the electrode surface. 
Conversely, the concentration of the reactants at the electrode surface 
will be very low. In fact, for a completely polarized electrode we can 
safely assume that at the electrode surface the reactant concentration is 
zero. In such a condition the amount of current that the electrode will 
pass is directly related to the mass flux of reactant from the bulk of the 
electrolyte solution to the electrode surface across the concentration 
gradient established by polarization. In turn, the rate of mass flux or 
diffusion of reactant is (by Fick's law) a function of the bulk concentration 
of reactant.

Since the reactants at the electrode are the current·carrying vehicles in 
the internal circuit (Le., in the electrolyte solution), the current generated 
in a cell with a polarized electrode can be made a function of the bulk 
solution concentration of reactant. When the rate at which the reactant 
is supplied by diffusion is just balanced by the rate at which it is 
consumed by reaction at the electrode, we can write 
Rate of supply of reactant by diffusion = rate of reaction at electrode

For a particular electrode system, the same temperature and physical 
conditions such as the stirring rate and the same electrode reaction, the 
term nFADI8 is a constant and therefore 
i =KC (7·66) 
The measurement of the current in a cell with a polarized electrode can 
therefore be used to measure the concentration of the reactant-producing 
polarization. 
Polarographic measurements can be conducted with either galvanic or 
electrolytic cells. With galvanic cells the potential required to drive the 
reaction at the polarizing electrode is generated by making the polarized 
electrode part of a galvanic celL With an electrolytic cell the potential is 
supplied by an external voltage source such as a battery. The indicating 
or polarized electrode is usually an inert metal (such as platinum) or a 
mercury droplet; the other electrode is usually a reference electrode (e.g., 
a calomel electrode). 
Polarographic methods using the dropping mercury electrode found 
wide acclaim for measuring metal concentrations in waters, but the 
emergence of atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) has largely replaced 
polarography of this type for metals analysis. However, it should be 
realized that the two techniques are capable of measuring different 
things. Atomic absorption spectrometry measures the total metal content, 
that is, all species containing a specific metal, unless some effort is made 
to separate one species from another prior to AAS analysis. Polarography 
and other electrochemical methods are capable of measuring individual 
species, excluding complex forms, for example, if they are involved in 
unique electrode reactions. 
1. Dissolved Oxygen Electrode. One of the current wide applications of 
polarographic techniques in water chemistry is using solid inert elec­
trodes, sometimes enclosed in a membrane that selectively passes the 
reactant of interest. An example of this type of cell is provided by the 
"dissolved oxygen probe" or "dissolved oxygen electrode." This electrode 
may be either of the electrolytic or galvanic type discussed above. The 
Makereth "oxygen electrode"" for example, is a galvanic cell employing 
a lead anode and a silver cathode in an aqueous KHC0 3 electrolyte, all 
isolated from solution by an oxygen-permeable polyethylene membrane 
(Fig. 7·40). Lead ions (Pb2+) are produced at the anode. This oxidation 
drives the cathodic reaction in which oxygen is reduced to OH-. Some

and its rate is controlled by the rate of supply of oxygen to the silver 
cathode. Therefore, the current in the external circuit is controlled by the 
rate of the oxygen supply to the cathode. This supply depends on the 
diffusion rate of oxygen across the membrane. Since the oxygen concen­
tration inside the membrane is kept low (virtually zero), the diffusion rate 
is a function of the oxygen concentration outside the membrane in the 
bulk solution. The current is, therefore, proportional to the bulk solution 
oxygen concentration. When using these electrodes, it is important that 
the bulk oxygen concentration close to the membrane does not become 
depleted. Therefore, it is essential to stir the bulk solution to ensure that 
the layer close to the membrane surface is constantly renewed with water 
of a composition representative of the bulk solution. 
2. Amperometric Titration of Chlorine. The second wide application of 
amperometric methods in water chemistry is the use of amperometric 
titration devices. In these instruments the polarization current is read out 
on a dial. A reagent is added that reacts with the polarizing reactant so 
that its bulk concentration is decreased. The dial reading decreases. 
Reagent is added until there no longer is a decrease in current upon the 
addition of further reagent (Fig. 7 -41). This indicates that all of the reacting 
species has been consumed because the current flowing in the cell no 
longer is influenced by a reagent that reacts with it. Free chlorine (HOCI 
and OCI-) can be determined by amperometric titration with the reductant 
phenylarsine oxide (C,HsAsO). The reaction is 
HOCI + C,HsAsO + H,O ~ HCI + C,HsAsO(OH), 426 OXidation-Reduction Reactions

(a) KOH Increase Decrease 
(b) Ca(NO~, Decrease Increase 
(c) KCl No effect No effect 
(d) Na,CO, Increase Decrease 
(e) CO, Increase Increase 
Reason for (a): 
OH-+ HCO, --> CO,'-; increase in [CO,'-±b by this step ~ X, but the 
solution is now supersaturated. Then, 
CO/-+ Ca2+ ~ CaC03(S); moles CaC03is/liter that ppt = Y. 
([CaH]o -Y)([CO,'-]o + X -Y) ~ K" 
Knowing [CaH]oX [CO,'-]o ~ K", by expanding, simplifying and assum· 
ing both X and Yare much less than [CaH]o and [CO,'-]o, we find that 
X _ Y ~ [CO,'-]oY 
[CaH] ° 
and, thus, that X > Y. Then, 
[CaH] ~ [CaH]o -Y; :. [CaH] decreases 
[CO,'-] ~ [CO,'-]o + X -Y; :. [CO,'-], and thus total alkalinity, increases. 
Reason for (e), 
Addition of CO2 will have no effect on total alkalinity if CaC03{s) is not 
present. However, it will cause the solution to become undersaturated 
with CaC03{S) because the solution pH is lowered. Since CaC03{S) is 
present, some will dissolve, thus increasing [Ca2+1 and total alkalinity.
