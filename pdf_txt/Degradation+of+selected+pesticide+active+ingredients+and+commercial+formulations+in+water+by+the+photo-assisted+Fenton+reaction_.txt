1. Introduction 
Very few regions of the planet possess abunda nt fresh water and access to adequate fresh 
water resources can be expected to worsen as a result of population growth and industrial 
demands for water. Liquid effl uents containing toxic substanc es are generated by a variety 
of chemistry-related industrial processes, as well as by a number of common household or 
agricultural applications. The inadequate management of these residues can cause 
contamination of the soil and of subt erranean and surface water sources. 
In general, the recovery of industrial effluent s containing low levels of organic substances 
by conventional treatments is not economica lly viable. Thus, for example, removal of the 
pollutant by adsorption onto active charcoal , while often efficient, requires subsequent 
recovery or incineration of the charcoal and me rely transfers the polluta nt from one phase to 
another (Matthews, 1992). Substances that are biocides or that are non-biodegradable 
represent a particular threat to the enviro nment and prevent the use of conventional 
biological treatments. Social and legal demands for environmental safety increasingly 
require that effluents discharged into the environment have minimal impact on human 
health, natural resources and the biosphere. Th ese demands have fueled increasing research 
into the development of new, more effective and economically viable methods for pollution 
control and prevention. When applied to the de gradation of pollutants, these reactions are 
usually grouped together under the designatio ns of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) 
or Advanced Oxidatio n Technologies (AOT). 
2. The principal advanced oxidation processes (AOP) 
Advanced Oxidation Processes ty pically employ chemical oxidizing agents in the presence 
of an appropriate catalyst and/or ultraviole t light (Legrini, et al., 1993; Sonntag, 2008; 
Matilainen & Sillanpää, 2010) to oxidize or degrade the pollutant of interest. AOPs have 
been employed for the degradation of a variety of organic pollutants, such as aliphatic and 
aromatic hydrocarbons, halocarb ons, phenols, ethers, ketones, etc. Examples of the major

types of AOPs that have been proposed in th e literature include (oxidant [catalyst, when 
present]/light): H 2O2/UV (Gryglik et al., 2010; Ho & Bolton, 1998); O 3/UV (Esplugas et al., 
1994; Machulek et al., 2009a); O 3-H2O2/UV (Yue, 1993); [TiO 2]/UV (Gaya & Abdullah, 2008; 
Henderson, 2011; Jenks, 2005; Matthews, 1992); Fe(III)/[TiO 2]/UV-Vis (Domínguez et al., 
1998); direct photolysis of water with vacuum UV (Gonzalez et al., 2004); Fenton reaction or 
H2O2-Fe(II) (Dao & Laat, 2011; Haddou et al., 2010; Kwon et al., 1999; Pignatello et al., 2006; 
Pontes et al., 2010); and the photo-Fenton reaction or H 2O2 [Fe(II)/Fe(III)]/UV (Benitez et al., 
2011; Huston & Pignatello, 1999;  Kim & Vogelpohl, 1998; Kiwi et al., 1994; Machulek et al., 
2007; Martyanov et al., 1997; Nichela et al., 2010; Pignatello et al., 2006; Ruppert et al., 1993). 
In most AOP, the objective is to use systems that produce the hydroxyl radical, HO•, or 
another species of similar reactivity such as the sulfate radical anion (SO 4•-). The hydroxyl 
radical is one of the most reactive species known in aqueous solution, surpassed only by 
fluorine atoms, and reacts with the majority of organic substances with little or no selectivity 
and at rates often approaching the diffusion-con trolled limit (unit reaction efficiency per 
encounter). The principal modes of reaction of HO• with organic compounds include 
hydrogen abstraction from aliphatic carbon, ad dition to double bonds and aromatic rings, 
and electron transfer (Bauer & Fallmann, 1997). These reactions generate organic radicals as 
transient intermediates, which th en undergo further reactions, eventually resulting in final 
products (P oxid) corresponding to the net oxidative degr adation of the starting molecule (R). 
Overall, a typical AOP process can be can be generically represented as: 
 HO• + R → → → → → Poxid (1) 
Evidently, however, this repres entation belies the underlying complexity of the intermediate 
steps that occur on the pathway(s) from R to P oxid. 
From an environmental standpoi nt, one must be sure that the degradation of the initial 
pollutant does not produce intermediate products that are as toxic as or more toxic than the 
initial pollutant that one wishes to degrade. Th us, it is absolutely essential that the progress 
of the degradation and the final degradation prod ucts be adequately characterized. Since the 
degradation of organic pollutants by the hydr oxyl radical is typically stepwise, even a 
relatively simple molecule like 4-chlorophenol can give rise to a plethora of intermediates, 
with from six to two carbon atoms, in variou s states oxidation (Li et al., 1999a, 1999b; Jenks, 
2005) before converging to the final mineralization products, CO 2, water and HCl. 
Identification and quantification of all of the intermediates an d determination of the kinetics 
and mechanisms of the individual reactions repr esent formidable tasks. For actual industrial 
effluents or wastewaters, which are often comp lex mixtures of pollutants, the intricacy of 
the degradation reactions can be enormous and one or more of the components or 
intermediates may be resistant to degradation and accumulate in the system. Not 
surprisingly, basic research into degradation pa thways and mechanisms is  still in its infancy 
for most of the AOP. 
Photochemical and photocatalytic processes ha ve enormous potential for becoming viable 
alternatives to conventional chemical AOP for the treatment of polluted waters and 
effluents. Currently available photochemical technology permits the conversion of organic 
pollutants having a wide range of chemical structures into substances that are less toxic 
and/or more readily biodegradable. In favorable cases, they can cause total decomposition 
of the organic constituents of the pollutant, ge nerally referred to as “total mineralization” 
(complete oxidation to carbon dioxide and wate r, plus inorganic salts of all heteroatoms

other than oxygen). Light of wavelengths in the range of 250-400 nm, corresponding to the 
ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum, is most commonly used in photochemical 
degradation processes (Braslavsky et al., 2011). Since ultraviolet light is a natural component 
of solar radiation, the sun provides a low-cost, environmentally friendly, renewable source 
of ultraviolet photons in photochemical proc esses. Thus, the use of solar photochemical 
reactors is an extremely interesting, cost-effect ive option for treatment of effluents in many 
of the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the planet. In area s with marginal or inadequate 
solar radiation intensity, conventional photochemical reactors fitted with ultraviolet lamps 
or hybrid UV lamp/solar photoreactors can be employed. In addition to light, the common 
AOPs use low to moderate concentrations of environmentally compatible chemical reagents 
and are capable, in favorable cases, of complete mineralization of the organic constituents of 
aqueous effluents. Although the initial or primary photochemical steps of the reactions 
employed to treat effluents can be conceptually  rather simple, a large number of subsequent 
quite complex chemical steps are often invo lved in the overall degradation process. 
Of the AOPs that have been proposed thus far, the Fenton reaction and the light-accelerated 
Fenton reaction, commonly known as the photo- Fenton reaction, appear to be the most 
promising for practical industrial applications (Pignatello et al., 2006). In the remainder of 
this chapter, we shall focus our attention on fundamental mechanistic details of the Fenton 
and photo-Fenton reactions, information that is  essential for the adequate design and control 
of photo-Fenton processes for the de gradation of organic pollutants.  
3. The Fenton reaction 
Over a century ago, Fenton (Fenton, 1894) demonstrated that a mixture of H 2O2 and Fe(II) in 
acidic medium had very powerful oxidizing pr operties. Although the precise mechanism of 
this reaction, now known as the Fenton reacti on, is still the subject of some discussion 
(Bossmann et al., 1998; Pignatello et al., 1 999, 2006), it is generally assumed to be an 
important chemical source of hydroxyl radica ls. The classical mechanism is a simple redox 
reaction in which Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) and H 2O2 is reduced to hydroxide ion and the 
hydroxyl radical:  
 Fe2+aq + H 2O2 → Fe3+aq + HO• + OH-  (2) 
For the degradation of organic molecules, the optimum pH for the Fenton reaction is 
typically in the range of pH 3- 4 and the optimum mass ratio of ca talyst (as iron) to hydrogen 
peroxide is 1.5 (Bigda, 1995).  
In the conventional Fenton reaction, carried out in the absence of light, the ferric ion 
produced in reaction (2) can be reduced back to ferrous ion by a second molecule of 
hydrogen peroxide:  
 Fe3+aq + H 2O2 + H 2O → Fe2+aq + H 3O+ + HO 2•-  (3) 
However, this thermal reduction (reaction 3) is much slower than the in itial step (reaction 2). 
Thus, although chemically very  efficient for the removal of organic pollutants, the Fenton 
reaction slows down appreciably after the initial conversion of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and may 
require the addition of relatively large amounts of Fe(II) in order to degrade the pollutant of 
interest. Another important limitation of the Fenton reaction is the formation of recalcitrant 
intermediates that inhibit the complete mineralization. Particularly noteworthy is the 
www.intechopen.comOrganic Pollutants Ten Years After  
the Stockholm Convention – Envi ronmental and Analytical Update 
 274 
formation of oxalic acid, H 2C2O4, a poisonous and persistent oxidation product of many 
degradation reactions. Since Fent on reactions are typically run at an initial pH of about 3 
and oxalic acid is a relatively strong acid (with a first pK a of 1.4), the accumu lation of oxalic 
acid causes further acidification of the reac tion mixture (to ca. pH 2) as the reaction 
proceeds. In addition, Fe(III) is very efficientl y chelated by the oxalate anion. This prevents 
the reduction of Fe(III) back to Fe(II) and hence the complete mineralization of the organi c 
matter. A still unresolved question in the me chanism of the Fenton degradation of organic 
material is the relative importance of other potential oxidizing species besides the hydroxyl 
radical. The stoichiometry of Fenton degradation reactions is complex and, in addi tion to 
Fe2+/Fe3+ and hydrogen peroxide, can involve the pa rticipation of the hydroperoxyl radical, 
HOO•, iron(IV) or ferryl, FeO2+, dissolved molecular oxygen, organic hydroperoxides, and 
other intermediates formed during the degradat ion. Despite these potential limitations, the 
conventional Fenton reaction has been widely us ed for the treatment of effluents (Benitez et 
al., 1999; Pignatello et al., 2006).  
Any reaction or process that enhances the rate of conversion of Fe(III) back to Fe(II) wil l in 
principle accelerate the rate of the Fenton reac tion. In the electro-Fent on reaction, this is 
accomplished electrochemically. Chemically, the Fenton reaction can be efficiently catalyzed 
by certain types of organic molecules, espe cially benzoquinones or dihydroxybenzene 
(DHB) derivatives. The catalytic influence of DHBs on the Fenton re action was originally 
reported by Hamilton and cowo rkers (Hamilton et al., 1966a, 1966b). Because DHBs such as 
catechol or hydroquinone and their analog s are common initial intermediates in the 
degradation of aromatic molecules, their presence in the reaction medium can result in 
efficient DHB-catalyzed redox cycling of Fe3+ back o Fe2+ (Chen & Pignatello, 1997; Nogueira 
et al., 2005). Indeed, in several cases, it has been shown that the addi tion of catechol or 
catechol derivatives can enhance the rate and th e overall mineralization efficiency of Fenton 
reactions (Aguiar et al., 2007; Zanta et al., 20 10). In addition, DHB-cata lyzed redox cycling of 
iron may be important in fungal degradation of lignin and several possible mechanisms 
have been suggested (Aguiar et al., 2007). Th e third method of accelerating the Fenton 
reaction is via irradiation with ultraviolet light, generally known as the photo-assisted 
Fenton or photo-Fenton reaction, which will be  the primary focus of the remainder of this 
chapter. 
4. The Photo-Fenton reaction 
4.1 General features of the Photo-Fenton reaction 
About two decades ago, it was found that the irradiation of Fenton reaction systems with 
UV/Visible light strongly accelerated the rate of degradation of a variety of pollutants 
(Huston & Pignatello, 1999; Ruppert et al., 1993) . This behavior upon irradiation is due 
principally to the photochemical reduction of Fe(III) back to Fe(II), for which the net reaction 
can be written as: 
 Fe3+aq + H 2O hv⎯⎯→  Fe2+aq + HO• + H+  (4) 
More detailed studies of the pH dependence of  the photo-Fenton reaction have shown that 
the optimum pH range is ca. pH 3. The reason  for this pH dependence becomes clear when 
one examines the speciation of Fe(III) as a function of pH (Figure 1) and the absorption 
spectra of the relevant Fe(III) species (Figure 2).  A t  p H  <  2 ,  t h e  d o minant species is

hexaquoiron(III), Fe(H 2O)63+ [or simply Fe3+ for convenience], which absorbs weakly in the 
ultraviolet above 300 nm. At pH > 3, freshly prepared solutions of Fe(III) are supersaturated 
with respect to formation of colloidal iron hydroxide, Fe(OH) 3 and prone to precipitation of 
hydrated iron oxides upon standing for a prolonged period. At pH 3, however, the 
predominant Fe(III) species present in aqueous solution is Fe(H 2O)5(OH)2+ [or simply 
Fe(OH)2+], which absorbs throughout much of the ul traviolet spectral region (Martyanov et 
al., 1997).

Mole fractions of each species were calcul ated with the public domain program Hydra 
(Puigdomenech, 2010), employing the equilibriu m constants for complexation supplied with 
the program (excluding insoluble iron species).  
Studies of the photochemistry of Fe(OH)2+ have shown (Pozdnyakov et al., 2000) that 
Fe(OH)2+ undergoes a relatively efficient photorea ction to produce Fe(II) and the hydroxyl 
radical:  
 Fe(OH)2+ hv⎯⎯→  Fe2+ + HO•  (5) 
Thus, irradiation of the Fenton reaction not only regenerates Fe(II), the crucial catalytic 
species in the Fenton reaction (reaction 2), but also produces an additional hydroxyl radical, 
the species responsible for the degradation of organic material. As a consequence of these 
two effects, the photo-Fenton process is faster than the conventional thermal Fenton process. 
Moreover, since Fe(II) is regenerated by light with decomposition of water (equations 4-5) 
rather than H 2O2 (reaction 3), the photo-Fenton process consumes less H 2O2 and requires 
only catalytic amounts of Fe(II).  
The photo-Fenton reaction has several oper ational and environmental advantages. The 
classes of organic compounds that are suscept ible to photodegradation via the Fenton 
reaction are rather well known (Bigda, 1995). The photo-Fenton process produces no new

 276 
pollutants and requires only small quantities of  iron salt. At the end of the reaction, if 
necessary, the residual Fe(III) can be precipitat ed as iron hydroxide by increasing the pH. 
Any residual hydrogen peroxide that is not consumed in the process will spontaneously 
decompose into water and molecular oxygen and is thus a "clean” reagent in itself. Thes e 
features make homogeneous photo-Fenton based AOPs the leading candidate for cost-
efficient, environmental friendly  treatment of industrial effluents on a small to moderate 
scale (Pignatello et al., 2006). An early example of an industrial-scale application of the 
photo-Fenton process was the decontamination of 500 L batches of an industrial effluent 
containing 2,4-dimethylaniline in a photochemical reactor fitted with a 10 kW medium 
pressure mercury lamp (O liveros et al., 1997).

4.2 Inhibition of the Photo-Fenton reaction by chloride ion 
Our interest in the fundamental mechanistic aspe cts of the photo-Fenton reaction arose from 
the necessity to optimize the degradation of organic material in effluents or wastewaters 
containing high concentrations of chloride io n. With such effluents, such as petroleum 
wastewaters from offshore marine environments or residues from organochloride pesticide 
production, the photo-Fenton reaction is st rongly inhibited. Thus, although the photo-
Fenton reaction results in essentially complete  mineralization of phenol in the absence of 
chloride ion (Figure 3, curve e), in the presence  of the chloride ion the mineralization process 
(indicated by the reduction in the amount of  total organic carbon, TOC) stops after only 
partial decomposition of the organic material (Figure 3, curve c).

or presence (curve c, ●) of 0.5 M NaCl; or with pH 3.0 main tained throughout the reaction in 
the absence (curve f, ∆) or presence of 0.5 M NaCl (curve d, ○). For details, see (Machulek et 
al., 2007).  
In the presence of chloride ion, the extent of mineralization in the photo-Fenton reaction 
(Figure 3, curve c) is comparable to that obse rved in the analogous th ermal Fenton reaction 
carried out in the dark in the pr esence or absence of chloride ion (Figure 3, curves a and b). 
Although we (Moraes et al., 2004a, 2004b) and ot hers (De Laat & Le, 2006; Kiwi et al., 2000; 
Maciel et al., 2004; Pignatello, 1992) had ascribed  this inhibition to the preferential formation 
of the less-reactive Cl 2•- radical anion instead of the desired hydroxyl radical, optimization 
of photo-Fenton reactions required a fuller un derstanding of the mechanistic details of the 
inhibition. For this purpose, we (Machule k et al., 2006) used nanosecond laser flash 
photolysis to investigate the influence of added chloride ion on the photocatalytic step that 
converts Fe(III) back to Fe(II) (e quation 5), deliberately omitting H 2O2 from the reaction 
mixture to prevent the thermal Fenton reaction . Although direct spectroscopic detection of 
the hydroxyl radical has proved el usive (Marin et al., 2011), the Cl 2•- radical anion, which 
absorbs at 340 nm ( ε340nm  = 8000 M-1cm-1), can be readily detected upon excitation of aqueous 
solutions of iron(III) at acidic  pH in the presence of added sodium chloride at 355 nm with 
the third harmonic of a Nd-YAG laser. Different ial absorption spectra (Figure 4) and kinetic 
traces (insert, Figure 4) showed fast formation of the Cl 2•- radical anion, within the lifetime 
of the laser pulse (5 ns), and its subsequent decay via mixed first and second order kinetics. 
The net decrease in absorption at longer times,  relative to that prior to the laser pulse, 
reflects the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II), which does not absorb in this spectral regi on.

complexation supplied with the program (excluding insoluble iron species).

Laser flash photolysis data for the production and decay of Cl 2•- were then obtained over a 
wide range of pH and concentration of Fe(III ) and chloride ion and these data used to 
develop an explicit mechanistic model for the in itial photoinduced processes involved in the 
photo-Fenton reaction in the presence of chlo ride ion (Machulek et al., 2006). As indicated in 
Figure 5, in the presence of chloride ion, th e dominant species present at pH < 2.5 is no 
longer Fe3+, but rather FeCl2+ and FeCl 2+ (coordinated waters being omitted).  
Moreover, FeCl2+ not only absorbs further out in the ultraviolet than Fe(OH)2+ (Figure 2), 
but it also undergoes photolysis (equation 6)  with a quantum yield higher than that of 
Fe(OH)2+ (equation 5). 
 Fe(Cl)2+ hv⎯⎯→  Fe2+ + Cl•  (6) 
The photoproduced chlorine atoms rapidly react with chloride ions to form Cl 2•- (equation 
7), the species actually detected in the laser flash photolysis experiments:  
 Cl•  +  Cl-  →  Cl 2•-  (7) 
and whose second order decay component is due to the disproportionation reaction: 
 Cl 2•- + Cl 2•- →  2 Cl- +  Cl 2  (8) 
The model employed to fit the experime ntally observed decay curves for Cl 2•- took into 
account the initial photochemical formation of the hydroxyl radical from Fe(OH)2+ (equation 
5) and of chlorine atoms from FeCl2+ (equation 6) and the subsequent reactions of these via 
the set of elementary st eps outlined in Table 1 (Machulek et al., 2006).

where X = OH or Cl and ΦHO = 0.21 and ΦCl = 0.47 are, respectively, the quantum yields 
for production of Fe(I1) from Fe(OH)2+ or Fe(Cl)2+ at 355 nm. A Fe(X) is the absorbance of 
either Fe(OH)2+ or Fe(Cl)2+ and AT the total absorbance of the solution, both at the laser 
excitation wavelength of 355 nm (in an effective optical path length of 0.5 cm). The ratio 
AFe(X)/A T was calculated from the initial concentrations of the species Fe(Cl)2+, Fe(Cl) 2+, 
Fe3+, Fe(OH)2+, Fe(OH) 2+ and [Fe 2(H2O)4(OH) 2]4+, together with molar absorption 
coefficients at 355 nm taken from the literature absorption spectra (Byrne & Kester, 1978, 
1981).  For each experimental condition (pH, [Cl-], [Fe(III)]), the relative concentrations of 
the iron(III) species were calculated with the public domain speciat ion program Hydra 
(Puigdomenech, 2010), employing the set of standard equilibrium constants for 
complexation supplied with the program. The incident laser intensity (I laser) was estimated 
by fitting the transient absorbance of Cl 2•- at time zero at pH 1.0 in the presence of 0.5 M  
NaCl, where competitive photolysis of Fe(OH)2+ is negligible. The concentrations of HO• 
and Cl• at t = 0 calculated from equation 9 served as the initial conditions for numerica l 
solution of the set of reactions and rate constants listed in Table 1. This kine tic model 
provided a quantitative fit of the observed transient decay curves (like that shown in the 
inset of Figure 4) over the entire range of  pH and concentrations of chloride ion and 
Fe(III) investigated.  
Having established the basic mechanistic scheme for the photoinduced steps of the photo-
Fenton reaction, one can then use it to infer th e course of a typical photo-Fenton degradation 
in the presence of chloride ion. At the beginni ng of the photo-Fenton reaction, when the pH 
is still ca. 3.0, the concentration of Fe(OH)2+ exceeds that of FeCl2+ or FeCl 2+, even in the 
presence of relatively high concentrations of chloride ion (Figure 5). The pH-dependent 
scavenging of HO• by chloride ion (equations 10-11): 
 HO• + Cl- ⇄ HOCl•-  (10) 
 H+ + HOCl•- ⇄ H2OCl• →  H 2O + Cl•  (11) 
is also still a relatively inefficient process, so that the photochemical formatio n of HO• 
should predominate. However, as the photo-Fenton process proceeds, partial degradation of 
the organic material causes the pH of the medium to fall to  ca. pH 2.0, where photolysis of 
FeCl2+ dominates over photolysis of Fe(OH)2+ and where the chloride ion efficiently 
converts any HO• formed in the system into the intrinsically much less reactive Cl 2•- radical

2002; Kiwi et al., 2000; McElroy, 1990; Moraes , et al., 2004a; Nadtochenko & Kiwi, 1998;

al., 2007; Moraes et al., 2004a, 2004b; Pignatello, 1992) will occur at moderate chloride ion 
concentrations [>0.03 M NaCl for aliphatic hydrocarbons (Moraes et al., 2004a); >0.2 M NaCl 
for phenols] when the pH of the medium reaches pH 2.0 or below. On the other hand, this 
sequence of events clearly indicates that it sh ould be possible to circumvent the inhibition 
by chloride ion by simply maintaining the pH at or slightly above pH 3 throughout the 
degradation process (see Figure 5). This is nicely illustrated by curve d in Figure 3, which 
shows that pH control does indeed permit nearly complete mineralization of phenol in the 
presence of chloride ion (Machulek et al., 20 06, 2007). Although pH control also enhances 
the rate of the photo-Fenton reaction in th e absence of chloride ion by optimizing the 
concentration of Fe(OH)2+ (see Figure 1), the effect is much less dramatic (compare curves e 
and f in Figure 3). 
Although the mechanism outlined in Table 1 nicely rationalizes the kinetic s of formation 
and decay of Cl 2•- on a fast time scale, it does not pe rmit prediction of the accumulation of 
Fe(II) in the same system in the absence of H 2O2 under steady-state irradiation. For this 
purpose, one must include additional kinetic st eps that are too slow to be relevant on the 
time scale of the laser flash photolysis experiments. Experimentally (Machulek et al., 
2009b) it is found that the concentration of Fe2+ eventually reaches a plateau value at long 
times, more quickly in the presence of chloride ion than in its absen ce (Figure 6). 
Simulation of this behavior required the inclusion of additional kinetic  steps, in particular 
for the back reactions that result in reoxidation of Fe2+. These additional kinetic steps are 
listed in Table 2.

4.3 Inhibition of the Photo-Fenton reaction by sulfate ion 
Also indicated in Figure 6 is the inhibition of the formation of Fe2+ in the presence of a 
relatively low concentration of added sulfate ions, based on the rate constants for 
complexation of Fe(III) by sulfate in Table 3. Sulfate ion is often present in photo-Fenton 
reactions as a result of the addition of iron in the form of readily available sulfate salts (De 
Laat & Le, 2005). Sulfate ion complexes strongly with Fe(III) over a wide pH range (Figure 7) 
and the quantum yield of production of Fe2+ plus a sulfate anion radical from photolysis of 
Fe(SO 4)+ is only about 0.05 (Benkelberg & Warnec k, 1995). Iron phosphate is even more 
photoinert than the iron sulfate complex (B enkelberg & Warneck, 1995; Lee et al., 2003) and 
should be an even more powerful inhi bitor of the photo-Fenton reaction.  
4.4 Catalysis of the Photo-Fenton r eaction by complexation of Fe(III) 
The efficiency of the photo-Fenton process can be further enhanced by using organic 
carboxylic acids to complex Fe (III) (Pignatello et al., 2006). A particularly important example 
is provided by oxalic acid. Thus, unlike the thermal Fenton reaction, in which oxalic acid is  a 
recalcitrant intermediate, in the photo-Fenton reaction it can act as a catalyst. Thus, 
ferrioxalate complexes can absorb light as far out as 570 nm, i.e., well into the visible region 
of the spectrum. Moreover, upon irradiation, th ey decompose efficiently (quantum yields of 
the order of unity) to Fe(II) and CO 2. The net result is that, in the presence of oxalate, the 
photo-Fenton reaction is intrinsically more e fficient, can be induced by a wider range of 
wavelengths of light, and results in the mineralizat ion of the oxalate ion. Thus, for example, in 
a municipal water treatment system, Kim & Vogelp ohl (1998) found that, with UV irradiation, 
the photo-Fenton process was at least 30% more en ergy efficient in the presence of oxalate than 
in its absence. Clearly, the sensitivity of the ferrioxalate-catalyzed photo-Fenton process to 
both UV and visible light makes it particularly attractive for applications in which th e sun is 
employed as the radiation source (Silva et al., 2010; Trovó & Nogueira, 2011).

4.5 Concurrent Photo-Fenton and Fenton reactions 
A final point that should be emphasized is that, under typical photo-Fenton reaction 
conditions, both the thermal Fenton reacti on and the photo-Fent on reactions occur 
concurrently in the reaction mixture. Ligh t is almost always the limiting reagent in 
photochemical reactions and ph oto-Fenton reactions are ofte n conducted in reactors in 
which the solution is recirculat ed through the photoreactor from  an external reservoir. Thus, 
at any given moment, the photo-Fenton reaction will be operative only in the portion of the 
total reaction mixture that is contained in the photoreactor per se , while the thermal Fenton 
reaction can proceed throughout the entire reaction volume. Indeed, comparison of the 
degradation of phenol under various conditions (Figure 3) strongly suggests that t he initial 
phase of the reaction is dominated by the ther mal reaction, with the in flection at about 80 
min where the curves diverge indicating the point at which the photo-Fenton reaction 
becomes dominant. 
Particularly interesting is the apparent insensitivity of the thermal Fenton degradation of 
phenol to the presence of added chloride ion, as  indicated by the simila rity of curves a and b 
of Figure 3. At the initial pH of 3 of the reaction mixture, the hydroxyl radical is inefficiently 
scavenged by chloride and produces, as the initial products of phenol degradation, the 
DHBs catechol and hydroquinone. Thus, unlik e the photo-Fenton reaction, which depends 
on the intermediacy of the hydr oxyl radical, the thermal degrad ation of phenol shifts to the 
DHB-catalyzed reaction mentioned above for the Fenton reaction until all of the DHBs have 
themselves been degraded (Chen and Pignatello, 1997 ). At that point, most of the iron(III) is 
rendered redox inert by complexation with oxalic acid and/or other recalcitrant aliphatic 
acids and the Fenton reaction ceases (Zanta et al., 2010). 
5. Areas for future development 
Despite significant advances in the last decade, the widespread successful app lication of 
photochemical technology for the treatment and decontamination of industrial residues and 
wastewaters is still not a reality. Research chemists and process engineers must work 
together to solve several important practical problems that limit the technological 
applications of the photo-Fenton reaction on  a large scale (Braun et al., 1991). Since the 
overall effective quantum efficiency can be relatively low, long irradiation times must be 
employed in order to achieve total mineralizat ion of the organic components of effluents. 
Electrical power consumption can then easily represent 60% of the total operating expense 
of a lamp-based photochemical reactor. A dditional costs associated with non-solar 
photochemical reactors include cooling, maintenance and depreciation of the lamps an d UV 
radiation shielding and protection for workers. One of the obvious economic benefits of the 
use of solar photochemical reactors is the elimination of costs associated with in stallation 
and maintenance of lamps and with electrical  power consumption (Moraes et al., 2004b; 
Nascimento et al., 2007). In pa rallel with the development of  solar reactors or hybrid 
lamp/solar reactors, an important area is th e development of photocatalysts that operate 
effectively under visible or solar irradiation (Anpo, 2000). 
Particularly in larger scale reactors, operationa l problems such as the formation of deposits 
on the reactor walls that block the incident  radiation must be addressed. Optimization 
strategies (Braun et al., 1991, 1993; Cassano et al., 1995; Nascim ento et al., 1994; Oliveros et 
al., 1998) must be applied to the design of reacto rs that homogenize the incidence of light on 
www.intechopen.comFundamental Mechanistic Studies of  
the Photo-Fenton Reaction for the Degradation of Organic Pollutants 
 285 
the reactor walls and maximize the total amount  of light absorbed by the system. Reactor 
design must also take into account the stro ng interdependence betw een light absorption, 
mass transport and reaction kine tics in solutions with high optical densities and optimize 
the balance between the concurrent photochemi cal and thermal contributions to the Fenton 
reaction. Although the relatively long i rradiation times required for the complete 
mineralization of organic contaminants tend to compromise the economic viability of s tand-
alone photo-Fenton processes, they can be viable  as a pre-treatment to reduce the toxicity of 
the effluent to levels compatible with other remediation technologies such as conventional 
biological treatment. Hence, the design of ph oto-Fenton reactors should also take into 
account the necessity of facile integration with  other effluent decontamination technologies. 
A final point that has only recently been cons idered in a more systematic context is the 
intensification of Fenton processes by incr easing the temperature (Zazo et al., 2011), 
particularly attractive in the case of photo-Fe nton reactions where a substantial part of the 
absorbed light energy is dissipat ed as heat in the solution.  
6. Conclusions 
Of the currently known advanced oxidation pr ocesses, the Fenton reaction and the photo-
Fenton reaction appear to be the most promising for practical industrial applications on a 
moderate scale. The fundamental photomechani stic aspects of the photo-Fenton reaction 
have been clarified by studies of the photochemi stry of Fe(IIII) in the absence of hydrogen 
peroxide in order to avoid the complications due to the competing Fenton reaction. The 
Fe(III) species primarily responsible for the initial photochemical generation of Fe(II ) plus a 
hydroxyl radical is Fe(OH)2+. Inhibition of the photo-Fenton by ions such as chloride or 
sulfate can be understood by considering th e competitive pH-dependent complexation of 
Fe(III) by these ions, the competitive absorption and photochemistry of these comple xes 
and/or the subsequent chemical  reactions that can convert th e hydroxyl radical into less 
reactive species. Adequate mechanisms, together  with the relevant rate constants, are now 
available for the inhibition of the net photoconversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) by both chloride 
and sulfate, allowing quantitative or semi-quantitative simulation of the experimentally 
observed inhibitory effects. As predicted by th e mechanistic models, the inhibitory effect of 
chloride ion on real photo-Fenton degradatio ns can be readily circumvented by simply 
maintaining the medium pH at ca. pH 3 thro ughout the reaction. Areas where additional 
progress would be welcome include an understand ing of the role of temperature effects on 
the Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions and new strategies for further enhancing the 
efficiency of the photo-Fenton reaction. Improv ements in photoreactor  design are necessary 
in order to optimize the contribution of the photoinduced processes relative to the 
concurrent thermal Fenton reaction.

wide range of organic chemicals (industrial formula tions, plant protection products, pharmaceuticals a nd
personal care products, etc.) still poses the highe st priority environmental hazard. The broadening of
knowledge of organic pollutants (OPs) environmental  fate and effects, as well as the decontamination
techniques, is accompanied by an increase in signif icance of certain pollution sources (e.g. sewage sl udge and
dredged sediments application, textile industry), a ssociated with a potential generation of new danger s for
humans and natural ecosystems. The present book add resses these aspects, especially in the light of Or ganic
Pollutants risk assessment as well as the practical  application of novel analytical methods and techni ques for
removing OPs from the environment. Providing analyt ical and environmental update, this contribution ca n be
particularly valuable for engineers and environment al scientists.
