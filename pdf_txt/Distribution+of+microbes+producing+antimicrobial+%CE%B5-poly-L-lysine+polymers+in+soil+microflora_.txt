Streptomyces  fermentation and widely used in Asian coun tries for food preservation . Here we 14 
discovered a  gene from cheese bacterium Corynebacterium variabile  that showed high similarity 15 
to the ε-PL synthetase  from Streptomyces  in terms of enzymatic domain architecture  and gene 16 
context . By cloning it  into Streptomyces  coelicolor  with a Streptomyces  albulus  ε-PL synthetase 17 
promoter, we confirmed that its product is indeed ε-PL. A comprehensive sequence  analysis 18 
suggest s that  ε-PL synthetases are widely spre ad among  coryneform bacteria  isolated from cheese 19 
and human skin ; 14 out of 15 Brevibacterium  isolates and 10 out of 12  Corynebacterium  isolates 20 
contain  Pls gene . This discovery raises the possibility that ε -PL as a bioa ctive secondary metabolite 21 
might be produced and play a role in the cheese and skin ecosystems.  22 
IMPORTANCE  Every year, m icrobial contamination causes billion s of tons of food wasted and 23 
millions  of cases of foodborne illness.  ε-PL is an excellent food preservative  as it is  potent, wide 24 
spectrum  and is  heat stable and biodegradable. It has not been accepted by all countries ( e.g those 25 
in the EU ) partially because it was  not a natural c omposition  of food but rather originated from the 26 
soil bacteria Streptomyces , a famous producer of various antibiotic dr ugs and toxins. The 27 
unexpected finding of ε-PL synthetases in cheese  and skin bacteria suggest s that ε-PL may 28 
naturally exist in cheese and on our skin .  29

lysine  (Fig. 1A) . It exhibits  antimicrobial  activity against  a wide spectrum of  bacteria , yeast,  and 36 
fungi  and is heat stable  and active in different  food matrices (1). ε-PL has been a popular  food 37 
preservative  in Japan since the late 1980s , followe d by Korea and China , and has been given   38 
Generally Regarded As S afe (GRAS) status  in the USA . As a secondary metabolite, ε -PL was first 39 
discovered from the  soil bacterium Streptomyces albulus , which is still used in its  commercial 40 
production (2). Later, more producers of ε -PL were identified from the family of 41 
Streptomycetaceae , including the genera Streptomyces and Kitasatospora , and ergot fungi (3, 4). 42 
ε-PL is synthesized by a cell -membrane -bound  nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) -like 43 
enzyme  named  ε-PL synth etase (Pls) . The structure and mechanism of Streptomyces  Pls has been 44 
well studied (5). Regulation of ε -PL biosynthesis and the natural role of this compound are  less 45 
well understood . 46 
Cheese prepared by fermentation of milk is an ancient food  with a history o f at least eight thousand 47 
years (6). The microorganisms on  and in  cheese and their secondary metabolites play key rol es for 48 
the flavor, quali ty, preservation and safety  of the cheese . When analyzing the genomes of cheese - 49 
isolated  bacterium Corynebacterium variabile  (7, 8)  with antiSMASH (9), we noticed  a gene 50 
encodi ng a NRPS -like enzyme  with high similarity to  Streptomyces  Pls (table S1) . InterProScan  51 
(12) result s show  that t hey share  a unique domain architecture , which is not  seen in typical NRPSs  52 
as found in the biosynthetic pathways of many peptide antibiotics, such as penicillin and 53 
vancomycin  (10). The enzyme has a typical NRPS adenylation -(A)-domain for substrate activation  54 
and a  thiolation -(T)/peptidyl carrier protein -domain for  tethering  the activated amino acid  substrate . 55 
It, however,  does not have the condensation domain s (C-domain) nor thioesterase domain s (TE- 56 
doma in) of  typical NRPSs. Instead,  there are three tandem domains (C1, C2 and C3) related to 57 .

domains  (Fig. 1B ). Similar  architecture s can only be found in  Pls related β-poly-L- 59 
diaminopropionic acid (β-PDAP)  synthetase,  γ-poly-L-diaminobutanoic acid (γ -PLDAB) 60 
synth etase and γ -poly-D-diaminobutanoic acid (γ -PDDAB) synthetase (11-13). β-PDAP, γ - 61 
PLDAB and γ -PDDAB are cationic isopeptide s structur ally similar to ε -PL (Fig. 1A) . β-PDAP 62 
and γ -PLDAB are co -produced with ε -PL in different Streptomyces  strains  with higher  antifungal 63 
activities and lower  antibacterial activities  than ε -PL (11, 12, 14 ). γ-PDDAB is produced by 64 
Streptoalloteichus hindustanus  with strong antiviral activity  and only weak antibacterial activities 65 
(13, 15 ). The Corynebacterium  protein  is more similar to Pls (sequence identity of 51%) than to 66 
the other three  synth etases (32%, 33% , and 31% , respectively ). Similar to  the Streptomyces  Pls 67 
gene , the Corynebacterium  gene  forms  an operon with a peptidase gene , which  is different from  68 
the gene contexts  of the other three synthetases  (figure S1). The Streptomyces  peptidase (PldII)  69 
was shown  to be a  ε-PL degrading enzyme and postulated  to have  a self-protection  function  (16).  70 .

was used as negative control.  (D) Precise  MS of the product  match with ε-PL of 26 to 35 residues.   79 
We tested  ε-PL production from  C. variabile  using a  two-stage culture method which was efficient 80 
in finding Streptomyces  producers  (18). However, no ε-PL production was detected in the culture . 81 
We reasoned that the cheese bacteria m ay have different regulation  of ε-PL biosynthesis to the soil 82 
bacteria Streptomyces . Therefore , we cloned the C. variabile  gene  onto a plasmid with a pBAD 83

The recombinant plasmid was transferred into model organism Corynebacterium 84 
glutamicum . However, again ε-PL production  could not be observed .  85 
In Streptomyces , the p romoter sequence is  critical for ε-PL production . It has been demonstrated 86 
that expression of pls in the native host S. albulus  with an altered promoter  did not lead to ε -PL 87 
production, but the use of the original promoter resulted in ε -PL  production even in a heterologous 88 
Streptomyces  host (19). Inspired by this , we cloned the C. variabile  gene under  the control of the 89 
S. albulus  pls promoter and transferred the plasmid into  Streptomyces coelicolor  M145 which does  90 
not have an endogenous pls gene . Using this expression system, ε -PL production was confirmed 91 
by UHPLC and high -resolution  mass spectrometry  (Fig. 1C and D) . 92 
Next we investigated the distribution of  pls in a genome collection of 156  bacteria  isolated from 93 
cheese from  Europe  and United States  (20). As the microorganisms  from cheese are known to  94 
originate  from or be related to animal and human skin microbiota  (21) and ε -PL is  also used in 95 
cosmetic products  (1), we furthe r included  a genome collection of 124 microorganism s isolates 96 
from human skin  (22). We used experimentally confirmed Pls protein  sequences  as query to do 97 
BlastP again st the two collections  with a cutoff  of 40% sequence identity and 80% sequence 98 
coverage . Pls homolog s were  found to be  concentrated in coryneform actino bacteria, including 99 
Corynebacterium , Brevibacterium , Arthrobacter , Microbacterium , Glutamicibacter , 100 
Rhodococcus , Micrococcus  and Dermacoccus . No hit was found  in bacteria from other phyla  (Fig. 101

results and NRPSpredictor2  results are in Data set  S1. 108 
Phylogenetic analysis shows that all the coryne form bacteria proteins cluster  together  with the 109 
experimental ly confirmed Pls from C. variabile , Kitasatospora , Streptomyces  and fun gi while  the 110 
synthetase s of the other three isopeptides  are on more distant  branches  (Fig. 2B) . Most importantly , 111 
NRPSpredictor2  (24) results show that the ten-residue substrate  recognizing pocket (23) of the 112 
coryneform bacteri a proteins are identical or highly similar to that of  the confirmed Pls  proteins  113 
but substantially  different from that of the other  three  synthetases  (Fig. 2B) , which strongly 114 
suggest s their substrate is lysine . 115

In this study, we confirmed that cheese bacterium C. variabile  has a  ε-PL 117 
synthetase gene. We did not observe ε -PL production by C. variabile  in our  artificial culturing 118 
condition s. This is probably because the production of this second ary metabolite is  regulated by  a 119 
mechanism we are yet to understand , which is not uncommon for antimicrobial  secondary 120 
metabolites. Further more , Pls were widely found in cheese - and skin - isolated coryneform bacteria . 121 
Most of the Brevibacterium  and Corynebacterium  isolates , which  are among the most important 122 
microorganisms in cheese production, have Pls . It is possible  that ε-PL naturally exist s in cheese 123 
product s and may have a role in  cheese  ecology, which require s further study .  124 
Bacteria . Corynebacterium v ariabile  DSM 44702 was obtained  from DSMZ.  Streptomyces 125 
coelicolor  M145 and Corynebacterium glutamicum  MB 001 (DE3) were  used as the heterologous 126 
hosts. E.coli  DH5α was used for DNA cloning . 127 
Gene cloning .  An expression  vector pXJ0GC was developed from  shuttle plasmid  pAL374  (25) 128 
by adding a pBAD promoter and an apramycin selective marker. The C. variabile  Pls gene was  129 
PCR amplified from C. variabile  genomic DNA  and clone d into  pXJ0GC , resulting in plasmid 130 
pXJ146. pXJ146 was introduced into C. glutamicum  by electroporation . A 450 bp  DNA sequence 131 
containing the pls promoter from S. albulus  was chemically synthesized and cloned together with 132 
the C. variabile  pls into pRM4 .3 resulting in plasmid pXJ155CV. pXJ155CV was intro duced into  133 
S. coelicolor  by conjugation . Primer s DNA sequence s and cloning details  are summarized in Table 134

Culturing  conditions.  Streptomyces  and Corynebacterium  strains were maintained on ISP2 agar  136 
(BD Difco™ ). They  were assayed  for ε-PL production  by a two-stage culture method  (18). S. 137 
coelicolor  strains  were  inoculated  in M3G medium  (26) at pH6.8  for 24 h at 30°C , then the p H 138 .

Corynebacterium  strains  were  cultured similarly with  GMPY  medium  (Malt extract 10 g/L; 140 
Pepton e 10 g/L; Yeast extract 0.1 g/L  autoclaved added with 10 g/L glucose as carbon source ) and 141 
1% arabinose  was used for  induction of gene expression  in recombinant  strains.  142 
Extraction.  A Bond Elut LRC -CBA column (A gilent Part Number :12113037)  was conditioned 143 
by washing with 5 ml methanol and then 5 ml water.  Bacterial culture supernatant was adjusted to 144 
pH8 by NaOH and loaded on the column with a speed of 3 ml per min . The co lumn was washed 145 
with 5 ml water and then eluted with 5  ml methanol  twice . The elution was dried  in a rotary 146 
evaporator at 38oC, redissolved and collected with 1  ml methanol  and then concentrated to 50 μl 147 
using a vacuum centrifuge . 148 
UHPLC -MS analysis . UHP LC-MS analysis of the extract  was performed on  a Dionex Ultimate 149 
3000 ultra -high-performance  liquid ch romatography (UHPLC) system coupled to  a high  resolution  150 
Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher  Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)  and a UV/Vis 151 
diode array detector (DAD) . Separate ESI+ and ESI - experiments  were carried out with MS scan 152 
range  of 100-1,000 Da . Injections of 8  µL of each sample were separated using a Waters Cortecs 153 
T3 column, 150  x 2.1 mm i.d., 1.6 µm particle size  at a temperature of 35.0 °C  and 0.35 ml/min  154
