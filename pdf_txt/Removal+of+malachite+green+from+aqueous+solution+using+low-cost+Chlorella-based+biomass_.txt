I. INTRODUCTION : 
Industries such as textile, paper, leather, 
pharmaceutical, cosmetic, etc use many dyes 
to colour their products1-3.This resulted in the 
generation of huge amount of coloured waste 
water. When these are discharged into the 
nearby w ater bodies, the enviro nment is 
severely disturbed.  This n ot only  affects the  
aesthetic nature of wate r, but also the 
photosynthetic process is hindered due to the 
reduction in the light penetration4. Under 
aerobic conditions many dyes present in the 
effluents may undergo decomposition resulting 
in the formation of carcinogenic aromatic 
amines which can cause serious health 
problem s to human and animals5,6. Dyes can 
also cause skin irritation, allergy, dermatitis 
and even cancer in humans7. Most of the dye s 
employed for coloration are known  to be 
carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and 
genotoxic8. 
Malachite green is one of the most widely 
used dyes for colouring purpose9. It is  used as 
a biocide in the aquaculture industry10. It is 
also used as a food col oring agent, 
disinfectant and anthelminthic as well as a dye 
in leather, cotton, paper, silk and jute 
indistries11,12. However there are several 
reports mentioning its hazardous and 
carcinogenic effects13. Therefore the treatment 
of effluents containing Ma lachite green is vital due to its harmful nature before it is 
discharged.  
Various methods are available for dye and 
colour removal, such as coagulation, chemical 
oxidation, membrane separation, filtration, 
reverse osmosis, aerobic and anerobic 
microbial d egradation14-16. However all these 
methods have limitations and non e of them 
were successful in removing the dye and 
colour from wastewater completely. Adsorption 
is the simplest process for dye removal. 
Activated carbon has been widely employed 
for adsorp tion of dyes17-21. However the high 
cost involved in pr oduction and regeneration 
restrict  its use. Hence extensive research is 
undertaken to develop economic adsorbents. 
In the literature numerous reports are found 
about the non conventional adsorbent s for  
their ability to remove malachite green from 
wastewater, such as de oiled soya22,baggase 
fly ash23, modified rice straw24, chitin25,orange 
waste26,lemon peel27 and raw barley straw28. 
In the present study, acid activated carbon 
obtained from  centell asia tica leaf is employed 
to remove malachite green from an aqueous 
solution . 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL  
Preparation  of  adsorbent  
Centella asiatica leaves was collected locally 
and washed with tape water several times to Research Article  
 
ABSTRACT  
Activated carbon prepared from Centella asiatica leaves was employed as an adsorbent for the 
removal of cationic dye, Malachite green from an aqueous solution. Effect of pH, adsorbent dose, 
dye concentration, contact time and tempe rature on the removal of the dye was investigated. 
Equilibrium data were analyzed using Langmuir and Frendlich isotherm models. The result shows 
that Centella asiatica leaf could be employed as an effective low cost adsorbent for the removal of 
MG.

wate r. It was then dried in sun shade. The 
dried leaves were powdered and soaked in 
con.H 2SO 4 (1:1,w/w), for a day, then filtered 
and dried. The charred mass was kept in a 
muffle furnace at 4000C for 1 hour, it was 
taken out, ground well to fine powder and 
stored in vacuum desiccators. The

Preparation of  adsor bate 
The adsorbate used in this study is M alachite 
Green was obtained from Merk, India, with  
molec ular formula –C23H25ClN 2, Molecular 
weight 364.92 -  λmax-618nm.  
 A stock solution of 1000mg /l of MG was 
prepared with distilled water . Desired 
concentration of dye solution was obtained 
from the stock solution by dilution.  
 
Batch equilibrium method  
Different initial concentration s ranging from 
10mg/l to 50 mg/l was taken in a series of 
250ml conical flasks. A known weight of  the 
adsorbent was added to 50ml of the dye 
solutions. A fixed amount of adsorbent was 
placed in 250ml  flasks containing 50ml of dye 
solution at different pH. Then the flasks were 
kept in an orbitary shaker with a speed of 
120rpm at room temperature for one and half  
hours. After filteration , the  dye solution s were 
analysed by UV -Visible spectrophotometer. 
The percentage of MG dye removal was 
calculated by using the following equation

III. RESULT S AND DISCUSSION  
Effect of pH  
The pH of the solution has significant impa ct 
on the adsorption of the dye, since it 
determines the surface charge of the 
adsorbent, the degree of ionisation a nd 
speciation of the adsorbate . In order to study 
the effect of pH on the adsorption of the dye 
molecules the batch equilibrium studies were 
conducted in the pH range of 1 to 10. The pH 
of the solution was adjusted to 1 to 10 by 
adding 1NHCl  or 1NNaOH solu tion and the 
results are presented in the fig1. From the 
figure it can be seen  that the adsorption 
increases with an increase in pH and reaches 
a maximum at pH= 5 and thereafter no 
appreciable change was observed. At low pH 
the H+ ions are high so the surf ace bec omes 
positively charged. The H+ ions compete with 
MG cations for vacant adsorption sites causing 
a decrease in dye uptake. At high pH the 
adsorbent surface is negatively charged which 
favours the uptake of cationic dye  by 
increased elect rostatic fo rce of attraction. 
Hence  the pH of t he medium was maintained 
at pH 5  for further studies.  
 
 
Fig. 1: Effect of pH on the adsorption  
of MG on to the adsorbent  
 
Effect of adsorbent dose  
The effect of adsorbent dose was studied at 
room temperature by v arying the dose from 
25mg to 150mg keeping the other parameters 
constant  and the results are presented in the 
fig.2. As the ad sorbent dose increas es the MG 
dye remova l also increases  and reaches the 
maximum at 100 mg of adsorbent dosage , 
thereafter there was no  appreciable increase 
in the percentage of dye removal. Therefore 
the adsorbent dosage was maintained at 100 
mg for further studies. This can be attributed to 
the availability of large number of vacant sites 
for adsorption.

Fig. 2:  Effect of adsorbent  dose on the  
adsorption of MG on to the adsorbent  
 
Effect of dye concentration  
The effect of  initial  dye concentration was 
studied with  10mg/l to 50 mg/l solution with an 
adsorbent dosage of 100mg for a contact time 
of 90 min. From t he fig.3, it can be obse rved 
that the  percentage removal o f MG gets 
decreased gradually . As the initial 
concentration is increased the ratio of the 
number of vacant sites on the adsorbent to the 
dye molecules decreases.

adsorption o f MG on to the adsorbent  
 
Effect of contact time  
Effect of contact time on the adsorption of MG 
is shown in fig. 4. As the contact time was 
increased from 15 min to 90 min, the 
adsorption percentage also increased and 
reaches a maximum at 90min. There was no 
appreciable change in the adsorption 
percentage above 90min. Hence all the 
experiments were conducted for a period of 
90min.

adsorption of MG on to the adsorbent  
 
 
 Effect of Temperature  
Effect of temperature on  the adsorption of MG 
is shown in fig. 5. As the temperature was 
increased from 30C0   to 60C0 the adsorption 
percentage also increased. As the 
temperature is increased there may be an 
increase in the porosity and in the total pore 
volume of the adsorbent. This may also be a 
result of an increase in the mobility of the dye 
molecule with the rise of temperature.

IV. ADSORPTION ISOTHERMS  
Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm  
The adsorption i sotherm indicate the 
relationship  between the amount  of the dye 
adsorbed by adsor bent and the amount of dye  
remaining in the solution . In this study, two 
most commonly used isotherms,  namely 
Freundlich and Langmuir were tested.  
The Langmuir isotherm29 was based on the 
assumption that maximum adsorption 
corresponds to a saturation monolayer of 
adsorbate molecules on the surface of the 
adsorbent, the ener gy of adsorption was 
constant and there was no interaction among 
the adsorbate molecules on the surface  of the 
adsorbate.  
The linear form of Langmuir equation is given 
as  
 
bQ QCe
QeCe
0 01
 
 
Where, Qe, is the amount of adsorbate 
adsorbed per unit mass of carbon, (mg/g) , Q0, 
is constant relating to monolayer adsorption 
capacity (mg/g) , b, is a constant relates to the 
energy of the adsorption process (L/mg) , Ce, 
is the equilibrium concentration of the 
adsorbate in solution (mg/L) , 
A plot of Ce/Qe against Ce for the adsorption 
of MG was shown in fig. 6. From t he slope and 
intercept  the values  Q0 and b were calculated . 
The value  of linear regression co -efficient  (R2) 
was found to be 0.999  (table -2) indicating that 
it  follow s  Langmuir adsorption  isotherm.  IJRPC 2016, 6(4),  916-921                                    Pasupathy  et al.                       ISSN: 2231 2781

The essential characteristics  of the Langmuir 
adsorption isotherm is expressed by a 
dimensionless constant called separation 
factor . This value indicates whether the 
adsorption is favorable or unfavorable.  
RL is defined by the following equation  
RL = 1/ (1+bCo)  
Where,  RL _ dimensionless separation factor , 
Ci – intial concentration ,  b – Langmuir 
constant (Lmg -1),The parameter R Lindicates 
the type of the isotherm accordingly  
 
Values of 
RL Types of 
isotherms  
RL>1 Unfavourable  
RL = 1 Linear  
0<R L<1 Favourable  
RL = 0 Irrevisible  
The R L value obtained using the above 
equation for 10mg/l MG concentration is 
0.3471. This RL value lies between 0 and 1 
indicating the favourability of the adsorption.  
 
Freundlich  Adsorption Isotherm  
The linear form of the Freundlich equation30 is 
as follows  
Cenlog1 logK   Qe logF
 
Where Qe = amount of dye adsorbed (mg/g) ,K      
= adsorption intensity ,n    = adsorption 
capacity  
By ploting  logQe  Vs logCe, the values of n and 
K were  calculated from slope and intercept 
respectively   (fig-7). The values are given in 
table -3. The value of linear regression co -
efficient (R2) was found to be 0.963  indicating 
that it  does not follow Freundlich adsorption 
isotherm.

V. THERMODYNAMICPARAMETERS  
Thermodynamic studies related to the 
adsorption process is essential to conclude 
whether a process will occur spontaneously or 
not, The fundamental criteria for spont aneity is 
the standard Gibbs free energy change ∆Go,   
the ∆Go value is negative , the reaction occurs 
spontaneously.  The Thermo dynamic   
parameters standard free energy (∆Go), 
change in Standard enthalpy(∆Ho) and change 
in  Standard entropy(∆So) for the ad sorption of 
MG onto the adsorbent were calculated using 
the following equation s.

The values of ∆Ho(KJmol-1) and ∆So (Jmol-1K-1) 
can be obtained from the slope and intercept 
of a linear plot between log K o and 1/T as are 
presented in table -4.

920 The ne gative values of  ∆Go indicated  that the 
adsorption process is  feasible and 
spontaneous in nature. Positive values of  ∆Ho 
suggested that the adsorption process was 
endothermic in nature. The positive value of 
∆So indicates that some structural changes 
occur  on the adsorbent and the randomness at 
the solid/liquid interface increased during the 
adsorption process.  
 
IV. CONCLUSION  
The adsorption  was found to highly  depen dent 
on various parameters like contact time, pH, 
intial concentration, and temperature.  It was 
concluded that maximum adsorption of MG 
from aqueous solutions occurred at pH5.  The 
experimental  data were cor related well by the 
Langmuir  adsorption isotherm . The result of 
this study indicates that this adsorbent can be 
successfully utilized  for the removal  of MG 
from aqueous solution.
