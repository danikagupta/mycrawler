III ABSTRACT 
The abalone (Haliotis midae) culture industry in South Africa is becoming increasingly 
dependent on the use of formulated feeds, due to limitations in the supply of kelp. The 
bulk of the feeds that are currently available were developed based on the requirements of 
juvenile abalone cultured within the optimal temperature range for growth (18 -20°C). 
However, most abalone farming facilities are land-based pump ashore operations and are 
thus mostly exposed to temperatures outside of this range. In addition, these feeds have 
been found to be unsuitable for abalone cultured at elevated water temperatures (> 20°C). 
The aim of the study was to develop size and temperature specific diets for H midoe 
through optimisation of dietary protein, energy and lipid levels. 
Abalone were cultured under farm-like conditions in three partially recirculating 
temperature controlled systems at either 18, 22 or 24°C and fed formulated diets 
containing graded levels of protein (18,22 and 26 %) and energy (11.6, 13.5 and 16.2 
MJ.kg·I). Abalone were stocked into baskets at 5 % of available of surface area (n=36) 
and each diet (n=9) was fed to four baskets of abalone at each of the three temperature 
regimes for ten weeks. Abalone growth was temperature dependent, with growth 
declining from 4.33 g.month-I for abalone cultured at 18°C to 0.77 g.month-I at 24°C. 
Dietary protein could be reduced from 26 to 18 % provided dietary energy levels were 
maintained at 13.5 MJ.kg-l• A dietary energy level of 11.6 MJ.kg-1 was insufficient to 
meet the energetic requirements of H midae regardless of the protein content of the diet. 
The effects of water temperature and body size on the protein requirements of H midae 
were investigated by culturing abalone at temperatures within the optimal range for 
abalone farming (i.e. 14, 16 and 18°C). Three size classes of abalone (15,50 and 80 
mm) were fed formulated feed containing graded levels of dietary protein (20, 26, 32, 38 
and 44 %) under controlled laboratory conditions for 12 weeks, and, in a separate 
experiment, under commercial farm conditions for 24 weeks. It was not possible to 
convincingly define the optimal protein levels for abalone of different sizes in this 
experiment because growth rates fell below average commercial growth rates obtained on 
farms. Growth was temperature dependent in the laboratory trial, with the rate of weight 
gain of the 15 mm (ANOV A: p=0.002) and 50 mm abalone (ANOV A: p=0.02) 
increasing significantly with an increase in temperature from 14 to 18°C. In the farm 
trial, dietary protein content did not affect the growth rate of the 10-15 or 80 mm abalone 
(ANOVA: p>0.05), however, the 50 mm abalone displayed significantly higher weight 
gain on the 32 % (4.72±0.20 g.month-I) and 38 % (5.01±0.34 g.month-I) protein diets 
compared to those fed the 20 % protein diet (3.75±0.13 g.month-I) (ANOVA: p=O.OI). 
Although definition of optimal dietary protein levels were not possible, the effects of 
dietary protein content and water temperature on the growth of H midae were 
independent signifying that the protein requirements of abalone are temperature 
independent. In addition, there was no evidence to indicate that abalone of the different 
sizes tested here had different dietary protein requirements. 
The size specific dietary lipid and protein requirements of H midae were investigated by 
feeding two size classes of abalone (30 and 60 mm initial shell length) diets containing 
IV graded levels of dietary lipid (4, 7, 10, 13 and 16 %) and protein (34 -39 %) for 12 
weeks. The 30 and 60 mm abalone were stocked at 7 (n=200) and 9 % (n=36) of the 
available basket surface area respectivel y and each diet was fed to four baskets of abalone 
of each size class. The protein requirements of H. midae are influenced by the amount of 
available dietary energy and thus it is possible that the ability of abalone to utilise lipids 
as a source of energy differs in the presence of varying levels of dietary protein. High 
levels of dietary lipid negatively affected the growth, condition factor and soft tissue 
glycogen content of both size classes of abalone. This negative effect was greater in the 
30 mm size class compared to the 60 mm abalone. The corresponding increase in feed 
consumption and feed conversion ratio in response to increasing levels of dietary protein 
also provides evidence that abalone are unable to utilise dietary lipids as an energy source 
and high levels of dietary lipid probably inhibit the uptake of carbohydrates and protein. 
High dietary lipid levels did however appear to promote gonad maturation . It was 
possible to reduce dietary protein from 34 to 20 % without negatively affecting growth 
through the maintenance of dietary energy levels and thus it is recommended that future 
experiments on the energy content offormulated feeds should focus on the improved use 
of carbohydrates. 
Reductions in the protein portion of formulated feeds for H. midae are possible provided 
the diet contains sufficient levels of energy supplied from carbohydrates. As the ability of 
abalone to utilise dietary lipid is limited, lipids are unlikely to playa significant role as an 
energy source in abalone feeds. Further investigations should focus on the utilisation of 
various carbohydrate sources in abalone feeds. 
v CHAPTERl. 
INTRODUCTION 
Abalone is one of the highest valued seafoods in the world fetching an average market 
price of $ 40/kg (Limin, 2006). The high market value coupled with a decline in natural 
stocks worldwide set the stage for the development of abalone farming technology and 
farming operations are now established in a number of countries including China, Korea, 
South Africa, Taiwan, Australia, Chile, United States of America, Mexico, Iceland, Peru 
and New Zealand (FAO, 2005). The success of the industry has led to farmed abalone 
accounting for 8600 metric tonnes of the total world abalone production of 22 600 metric 
tonnes in 2002 (Gordon and Cook, 2004). 
The Japanese set the stage for the culture of abalone worldwide as their pioneering work 
on artificial spawning, animal husbandry, culture techniques and feeding strategies 
provided a foundation for other countries to initiate research on their respective species 
through the adoption and adaptation of these techniques (Hahn, 1989a; Britz, 1995). 
Genade et al. (1988) laid the foundation for abalone farming in South Africa by 
successfully spawning the local abalone Haliotis midae in captivity. The successful 
spawning of H. midae coupled with the high market value and decline in natural stocks 
led to several fishing companies initiating research projects into the development of 
abalone farming in the early 1990's (Hecht, 1994; Cook, 1998; Sales and Britz 2001a; 
Troell et aI., 2006). The farming of abalone is now the largest and fastest growing sector 
in the local mariculture industry, and South Africa is currently the third largest producer 
of cultured abalone in the world with an annual production of830 tf' (FAO, 2005; Jones 
and Britz, 2006). 
A number of factors have led to the success of the local abalone culture industry, such as 
the close working relationship established between fishing companies and research 
institutions into the development of culture techniques, the availability of suitable 
farming sites and favourable water quality conditions (Cook, 1998; Sales and Britz 
200 I a; Troe1l et aI., 2006). However, the development of a water stable nutritionally 
I complete formulated feed was one of the crucial breakthroughs in the development of 
abalone farming technology in South Africa, since formulated feeds offer a number of 
nutritional, economic and convenience benefits (Britz et a!., 1994; Sales and Britz 
2001a). The South African abalone was found to readily accept an artificial feed which 
produced superior growth rates compared to those reared on natural seaweed diets and 
growth rates obtained indicated that abalone farming was economically feasible (Britz et 
aI.,1994). 
Feed costs account for a large proportion of operational costs on South African abalone 
farms and it is for this reason that the bulk of published research on H. midae has focused 
on the nutritional requirements and digestive capabilities of the animal (Sales and Britz 
2001a). This was done in an effort to develop economically viable formulated diets that 
contain a suitable balance of feed ingredients that are nutritionally available to the animal 
in order to maximize growth rates (Sales and Britz 2001a). Abalone farmers in South 
Africa currently make use of either cultured or harvested algal diets, formulated feeds or 
a combination of the two (Cook, 1998; TroeIl et a!., 2006). Kelp (Ecklonia maxima) and 
Abfeed® a formulated feed manufactured by Marifeed (Pty) Ltd. (Hermanus, South 
Africa), constitute the two major feed sources used on South African abalone farms 
(Naidoo et a!., 2006; TroeIl et a!., 2006). However, the maximum sustainable harvest of 
kelp was reached in 2003 and thus the continued use of kelp as a feed source is limited 
(Loubser, 2005; Troell et a!., 2006). In addition to this, there are currently twenty two 
registered abalone permits with a further five in the developmental stages (Troell et a!., 
2006). Thus, further expansion of the abalone culture industry has always been viewed as 
being reliant on the use of cultured algal or formulated feeds (Britz et a!., 1994; Troell et 
a!., 2006). However, about half by weight of the abalone produced in 2006 were 
produced using Abfeed® and thus the use of formulated feeds is likely to increase (Britz 
and Jones, 2006). 
Haliotis midae has a natural distribution spanning the convergence of the Indian and 
Atlantic Oceans, from the cold waters of the Benguela upwelling system on the west 
coast to the warmer waters of the Agulhas current on the east coast (Britz et a!., 1997). 
2 Thus, natural populations are exposed to mean monthly sea temperatures ranging from 12 
-13 °C along the west coast to 21 -22°C on the east coast (Greenwood and Taunton­
Clark, 1994; Schumann et aI., 1995; Britz et aI., 1997). Temperature is the principal 
environmental factor influencing the metabolic rate of poikilothenns (Fry, 1971) and H. 
midae has been shown to confonn with this trend (Britz et aI., 1997). Britz et al. (1997) 
demonstrated that water temperatures in the range of 12 to 20°C were physiologically 
optimal for H. midae in tenns of growth, condition factor and feed conversion efficiency. 
Temperatures above 20°C resulted in a decline in growth and a sharp increase in 
mortality and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (Britz et aI., 1997). Therefore, most fonnulated 
feeds currently available in South Africa have been developed to promote the growth of 
abalone cultured within the physiological optimal temperature range 18 -20°C (Britz et 
aI., 1997) i.e. the bulk of research conducted to optimise Abfeed® was carried out within 
this narrow range. However, the majority of abalone fanning operations make use of 
land-based pump ashore single pass technology and thus are mostly exposed to 
temperatures outside of the optimal range (Cook, 1998; Troell et aI., 2006). Attempts at 
regulating on-farm water temperatures are not economically viable and thus it was 
hypothesised that it may be possible to improve the growth of abalone cultured at 
temperatures outside the optimal range by means of development of temperature specific 
dietary formulations. 
While a number of studies have demonstrated the effects of temperature on abalone 
growth (Britz et aI., 1997; Lopez et aI., 1998; Searle et aI., 2006; Garcia-Esquivel et aI., 
2007), none of these studies have considered the effect of temperature on the nutritional 
requirements of abalone. The energetic requirements of an animal are detennined 
primarily by temperature (Smith, 1989), and the protein requirements of certain fish 
species have been found to be altered at different water temperatures (Wilson, 2002). 
Dixon (1992) found that protein digestibility in H. midae was significantly higher at 18 
°C compared to either IS or 22°C. Since protein digestibility (Dixon, 1992) and feed 
consumption (Britz et aI., 1997) have been found to be influenced by water temperature it 
is likely that the protein and energy requirements of H. midae are affected by water 
temperature and thus improvements in growth for abalone grown outside of the optimal 
3 temperature range may be possible through the provision of sufficient levels of dietary 
protein and energy. 
Protein has received the most attention in abalone nutritional studies as it is the principal 
dietary ingredient responsible for growth and is the most expensive cost component in 
formulated feeds (Mai et ai., 1995a; Fleming et ai., 1996). Feed formulators continually 
strive to define the optimal dietary protein level of formulated feeds for different species 
i.e. the level at which maximal growth occurs with the minimum amount of dietary 
protein (Wilson, 2002). Early attempts at defining optimal dietary protein levels of 
abalone involved feeding abalone incremental levels of dietary protein often provided 
from a single dietary protein source with little consideration of dietary energy levels (Mai 
et ai., 1995a; Britz, 1996a). However, when attempting to define optimal dietary protein 
levels it is vital to consider the digestibility , amino acid profile of the test ingredients as 
well as the energy level of the test diet as a deficiency in one or more of these factors 
may lead to an overestimation of optimal dietary protein levels (Wilson, 2002). In 
addition, provision of dietary protein from a single source is likely to lead to an 
overestimation of dietary protein requirements (Mai et aI., 1995a; Coote et ai., 2000). 
Consideration of dietary energy levels is vital to ensure that sufficient energy is available 
for the energetic costs of physical activity and maintenance, thus allowing the protein 
portion of the diet to be made available exclusively for growth (Smith, 1989). The use of 
protein as an energy source should be avoided not only due to the costs associated with 
protein but also because it leads to the deamination of amino acids and the excretion of 
excess ammonia, which can create water quality complications (Smith, 1989). Therefore, 
beyond the requirements for essential amino acids for growth, the energetic requirements 
of abalone should as far as possible be satisfied through the use of non-protein sources of 
energy. 
Carbohydrates and lipids serve as the potential energy sources for use in abalone feeds. 
Carbohydrates have been found to be highly digestible by abalone and are therefore the 
preferred energy source in abalone feeds (Mai et ai., 1995b; Knauer et ai., 1996; Monje 
and Viana, 1998; Gomez-Montes et ai., 2003; Thongrod et ai., 2003; Durazo-Beltran et 
4 
) aI., 2004; Montano-Vargas et aI., 2005; Viana et aI., 2007). Abalone have been found to 
have a limited ability to digest and utilise high levels of dietary lipid which is believed to 
be linked to the low lipid content of natural algal diets and the low levels of lipases 
present in the abalone gut (Mercer et aI., 1993; Mai et aI., 1995b; Britz et aI., 1996; 
Fleming et aI., 1996; Knauer et aI., 1996; Britz and Hecht, 1997; Durazo-Beltran et aI., 
2003; Thongrod et aI., 2003; Montano-Vargas et aI., 2005; Garcia-Esquivel and Felbeck, 
2006). In addition to this high levels of lipid have been found to reduce the uptake of 
other nutrients in the diet (Van Barneveld et aI., 1998). However, previous research on 
lipid utilisation has not considered the relationship between dietary energy and protein 
and it is possible that the ability of abalone to utilise lipids as a source of energy differs in 
the presence of varying levels of dietary protein. 
Recent trends in abalone nutritional studies have focused on the identification of 
alternative dietary protein sources as well as reductions in the protein portion of 
formulated feeds. Identification of alternative dietary protein sources have been 
undertaken for Haliotis fulgens (Guzman and Viana, 1998), Haliotis midae (Shipton and 
Britz, 200Ia), Haliotis asinina (Bautista-Teruel et aI., 2003) and Haliotis discus hannai 
(Cho et aI., 2008). Shipton and Britz (200Ia) found that fishmeal could be replaced with 
up to 30 % of sunflower meal, soya or torula yeast without significantly affecting the 
growth of H. midae. Reductions in the protein portion of formulated feeds for abalone 
have been demonstrated for species including: H. asinina (Bautista-Teruel and 
Millamena, 1999), H. laevigata (Coote et aI., 2000), H. midae (Sales et aI., 2003; Jones 
and Britz, 2006). These reductions have been achieved through the provision of sufficient 
levels of dietary energy supplied from carbohydrates. It is likely that further reductions in 
the protein portion of formulated feeds may be possible through manipulation of dietary 
protein to energy ratios. 
Efforts to optimise the dietary protein content of formulated feeds are not focused 
exclusively on the potential economic benefits but also on improvements on factors such 
as culture environment water quality and animal health. The use of high protein diets has 
been associated with outbreaks of the sabellid worm Terebrasabella heterouncinata on 
5 abalone fanns (Simon et aI., 2004). In addition to this, abalone fed high protein diets and 
exposed to additional stressors such as handling or elevated water temperatures have been 
found to be susceptible to "bloat". This is a condition which is believed to be caused by 
the proliferation of gut bacteria which leads to the fennentation of the gut contents and 
the accumulation of gas in the digestive tract (Macey and Coyne, 2005; Godoy et aI., 
2006). Optimisation of dietary protein to energy ratios may lead to economic savings as 
well as reductions in water quality complications associated with fonnulated feeds. 
The relationship between the dietary protein and energy requirements of H midae have 
not been addressed since the findings of Britz and Hecht (1997). A dietary lipid content 
of 10 % was found to negatively affect growth, and juvenile abalone (10 mm shell length) 
were found to have a lower dietary protein requirement (34 %) compared to young adult 
abalone (40 mm shell length) (44 %) (Britz and Hecht, 1997). Differences in the 
nutritional requirements of abalone of different sizes were also detected by Shipton and 
Britz (200 I b). The protein requirements of fish generally decrease with an increase in age 
and size (Wilson, 2002). Based on the findings of Britz and Hecht (1997) abalone may 
not confonn to this trend. However , more recently Jones and Britz (2006) found that it 
was possible to reduce the protein content of fonnulated feeds for adult H midae (> 50 
mm shell length) from 34 to 26 % without negatively affecting growth. Clarification of 
the nutritional requirements of abalone of different sizes may lead to the developm ent of 
size specific dietary fonnulations thus optimising current dietary formulations. 
The South African abalone culture industry is now considered to have entered a mature 
phase with an estimated total investment in excess of ZAR 190 million (Loubser, 2005). 
However, the rise in abalone production worldwide from countries such as Australia and 
Chile threatens to reduce the average market price (Loubser, 2005). It is therefore vital 
for South African abalone fanners to reduce operational costs in order to remain 
competitive on the world's markets. The optimisation of dietary protein and energy levels 
in fonnulated feeds as well as the potential development of temperature and size specific 
feeds will not only result in economic benefits but will also help take pressure off natural 
kelp reserves and improve on-fann water quality conditions and animal health. 
6 Aims and objectives 
The overall aim of the study was to investigate the protein and energy requirements of 
abalone of different sizes cultured within a range of different water temperatures. 
The objectives were to: 
I. Investigate the protein and energy requirements of H. midae cultured at optimal 
(18 -20°C) and elevated (22 -24 0c) water temperatures. 
2. Investigate the size specific dietary protein requirements of H. midae cultured 
within the optimal temperature range (14 -18°C) under laboratory and farm 
conditions. 
3. Investigate the size specific dietary lipid requirements of H. midae and determine 
whether abalone are able to utilise dietary lipids as a source of energy.

THE PROTEIN AND ENERGY REQUIREMENTS OF FARMED SOUTH 
AFRICAN ABALONE HAL/OTIS MJDAE CULTURED AT OPTIMAL AND 
ELEVATED W ATER TEMPERATURES 
2.1 Introduction 
Abalone farms in South Africa are becoming increasingly dependent on the use of 
formulated feeds due to limitations in the supply of harvested seaweed (Britz et aI., 1994; 
Loubser, 2005; Troell et aI., 2006), and formulated feeds promote superior growth rates 
compared to natural diets (Viana et aI., 1993; Britz et aI., 1994; Britz, 1996b; Capinpin 
and Corre, 1996; Bautista-Teruel and Millamena, 1999). Farmers make use of either 
cultured or harvested algal diets, formulated feeds or a combination of the two (Cook, 
1998; Troell et aI., 2006). However, the use of formulated feeds is avoided at 
temperatures in excess of 20°C (Britz et aI., 1997), due to the perception that the abalone 
are susceptible to "bloat", a fatal condition caused by proliferation of bacteria in the gut 
resulting in the fermentation of the gut contents and accumulation of gas in the digestive 
tract (Macey and Coyne, 2005; Godoy et aI., 2006). Britz et al. (1997) demonstrated that 
temperatures in the range of 12 to 20°C were physiologically optimal for H. midae and 
growth, feed consumption and condition factor declined and feed conversion ratio (FCR) 
and mortality increased sharply at temperatures in excess of 20°C. Since the currently 
available commercial feeds were formulated to promote maximal growth of abalone 
cultured within the physiologically optimal temperature range, it was hypothesised that 
the dietary protein and energy requirements of abalone cultured within the stressful 
temperature range of (20-25 0c) might differ significantly. 
The overall aim of this study was thus to investigate the effect of dietary protein and 
energy on the growth and survival of abalone cultured at optimal and elevated water 
temperatures in order to try and develop a diet that can safely be fed to abalone cultured 
at elevated water temperature s. The growth, consumption and survival of adult H. midae 
(> 50 mm initial shell length) fed formulated diets containing graded levels of protein 
8 (18,22 and 26 %) and energy (11.6, 13.5 and 16.2 MJ.kg,l) and cultured at 18,22 and 24 
°C were compared. 
2.2 Materials and methods 
2.2.1 Experimental system 
The experiment was conducted at the Rhodes University Port Alfred Marine Research 
Laboratory (33°45'S; 26°00'E) in three identically designed partially recirculating culture 
systems, each comprised of four 1500 L canvas tanks (2.2 m x I m x 0.8 m; length, width 
and depth) and a 1000 L header tank (Figures 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3), Three of the tanks in each 
system were used to hold abalone while the fourth tank acted as a sedimentation tank and 
held the biological filter. The biological filter included submerged oyster shells and a 
shredded plastic trickle filter. Water was recirculated within each system so that the entire 
volume of each of the three tanks in each system was exchanged every two hours. A 
protein skimmer (Ultrazap ®, Johannesburg, South Africa) was included inline and 10 % 
of the entire system's volume was replaced daily with seawater (35 g.L'I) from the Kowie 
River estuary. 
Each holding tank contained J 2 oyster mesh baskets (36 cm x 48 cm x 60 cm), and each 
basket contained six vertical Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic plates (total surface 
area: 14040 cm2) and a horizontal "feeding plate" positioned eight cm below the surface 
of the water. 
The water temperature in each of the systems was set at either 18, 22 or 24°C. Water 
temperatures were raised by 1 °C every 24 h at the start of the trial until the experimental 
systems reached the required temperatures. The temperatures were maintained using 
thermostatically controlled submerged heaters (three kW) housed in each header tank and 
thermostatically controlled in-line water chilling units (Aqua medic® Titan 4000, 
Guangzhou , China). In addition to this Isotherm® insulation was placed around the tanks 
and header tanks and corrugated plastic sheeting was also placed around the sides of the 
tanks and lids were placed over the top of the tanks.

Marine Research Laboratory. 
Aeration was provided by airlines installed along the length of the bottom of each tanle 
The tanks were drained, cleaned and refilled with water of the required temperature from 
the same system once a week. The systems were exposed to a natural photoperiod 
regime, which was approximately 12:12 (L:D). 
2.2.2 Experimental diets 
Nine experimental diets were formulated to contain graded levels of crude protein (18, 22 
and 26 %) and energy, in order to produce a range of protein to energy ratios (1.10 -2.14 
g protein! MJ.kg"1 energy) (Table 2.1). This resulted in three dietary energy contents, 
high (16.2 MJ.kg·I), medium (13.5 MJ.kg-l) and low (11.6 MJ.kg-l) per dietary protein 
content. Low temperature steam dried, formaldehyde free, mackerel fishmeal (Oceana 
11 (Pty) Ltd, South Africa) and soya-oil cake were used as the primary protein sources and 
the diets had a constant dietary lipid content of 5.5 %. Fresh kelp (Ecklonia. maxima), a 
vitamin and mineral mix (Vitamin mineral premix, BASF Animal Nutrition (Pty) Ltd, 
South Africa) and starch carbohydrates were also included based on a proprietary 
commercial formulation (Marifeed Pty Ltd, South Africa). Diatomaceous earth replaced 
starch as a non-nutritive filler in order to obtain the desired protein: energy ratios. 
The digestible energy coefficients of fishmeal, soya-oil cake and carbohydrates were 
calculated using the digestibility coefficients determined by Sales and Britz (2001 b). 
While, the value for kelp (E. maxima) was not available so the value was estimated based 
on the digestible energy coefficients of other seaweeds that were established for the sea 
urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Schlosser et aI., 2005). 
The proximate composition of the experimental diets were measured using the standard 
methods of the AOAC (2003). Crude protein was determined using the semi-micro 
Kjeldahl method (N x 6.25), moisture by oven drying samples at 95°C for 72 h, ash as 
the residue remaining following the combustion of samples at 550°C for IS h, fat by the 
Soxhlet extraction method, phosphorus content by digesting samples with sulphuric acid, 
hydrogen peroxide and a selenium catalyst using a block digestor at 360°C and gross 
energy was determined by combustion of samples in a adiabatic calorimeter. 
2.2.3 Experimental animals, acclimation andfeeding 
Abalone with a mean starting shell length of 54.90±0.OS mm and weight of 2S.99±O.l6 g 
were obtained from Marine Growers Abalone Farm (Pty) Ltd situated on the east coast of 
South Africa where they had previously been fed a combination of cultured algal diets 
and an artificial feed (Table 2.2). They were stocked into the baskets at 5 % of available 
surface area (i.e. 36 abalone per basket) and acclimated to the experimental systems for 
five weeks before the start of the trial. They were fed a locally produced commercial feed 
Abfeed®-K26 (26% crude protein, 1 % lipid, Marifeed (Pty) Ltd) and kept at IS °C 
during the acclimation period.

The diets were assigned to baskets of abalone using a randomised block design to ensure 
that each diet was fed to four baskets of abalone at each temperature regime and that 
there was at least one replicate in each of the three tanks in each system. Thus each diet 
was replicated four times at each of the three temperature regimes. Each basket was 
assumed to be a unit of measure, since it was not feasible to build nine isolated systems, 
i.e. one for each of the three temperature regimes, at the commercial-like scale at which 
the experiment was run. The reliability of this assumption was strengthened by block­
design described here. 
Abalone were fed to apparent satiation daily at 16hOO six days a week. Food consumption 
and uneaten food was recorded for each basket of abalone during the course of the trial. 
Any uneaten food was removed within in 24 hours and frozen at -4°C. It was later oven 
dried at 100°C for 24 h and then weighed at the end of the trial. 
2.2.4 Solid leaching of diets 
Leaching rates were determine d for each diet at the three temperature regimes by placing 
109 of feed on a "feeding plate" in a basket containing no abalone with four replicate 
samples per diet at each temperature regime. The feed was removed after 24 hours and 
14 oven dried at 100 °C for a further 24 hours. The leaching rates were calculated as the dry 
weight loss during the 24 h period in the water. 
2.2.5 Data collection 
The abalone were purged for 24 h prior to being weighed and measured. They were then 
anaesthetised with a 10 % magnesium sulphate solution and excess water was removed 
from the shell of the abalone using paper towel. All the abalone in each basket were 
weighed (0.0 I g) using an electronic balance and measured (0.0 I mm) with digital 
vernier calipers at the start and end of the 10 week growth trial. 
Abalone shell length gain, weight gain and survival were calculated for all treatments. 
Abalone condition factor was calculated according to Britz (1996b) using the equation: 
Condition factor = weight (g)/length (mmf299 x 5575 (I) 
Feed conversion ratio (FCR) and daily feed consumption (% body weight per day) were 
corrected for solids leaching and calculated for all treatments according to Britz (1996b) 
using the equations: 
FCR = dry feed consumed (g)/wet weight gain (g) 
Cy, b. w' = Cg/ W, x 100 (2) 
(3) 
where Cg is the mean daily feed consumption corrected for leaching and W, is the mean 
abalone weight at time t (days). W, was calculated using the equation: 
W,=Wox «SGRIIOO)+ 1)'"1 
where Wo is the mean initial abalone weight and SGR is the specific growth rate. 
The SGR was calculated using the equation: 
SGR = ((In(Wr) -In(W;))/ t )100 (4) 
(5) 
where SGR is the specific growth rate (% body weight increase per day), In(W r) is the 
natural log of the mean final weight of abalone, In(W;) is the natural log of the mean 
initial weight of abalone, and t is the time in days. 
15 Baskets were checked for mortalities every second day and any dead abalone were 
removed and recorded. 
2.2.6 Water chemistry 
Temperature and pH readings were recorded twice a day using a digital temperature and 
pH probe (Hanna Instruments, HI 98128, Woonsocket, USA). Dissolved oxygen was 
monitored daily with an oxygen meter (Hanna Instruments HI 9143, Woonsocket, USA). 
Salinity was monitored using a refractometer (Extech Instruments , RF20, Waltham, 
USA). Ammonia and nitrite were measured twice a week using colourmetric titration kits 
(Red Sea Fish Pharm, Houston, USA). Free unionised ammonia (FAN) was calculated 
based on total ammonia nitrogen readings (TAN), temperature , pH and salinity values 
according to Bower and Bidwell (1978). Water chemistry data for the 10 week trial is 
summarised in Table 2.3.

The effect of dietary protein, energy and water temperature on abalone shell length gain, 
weight gain, final condition factor and feed consumption were compared using a 
multifactor analysis of variance (multifactor ANOVA) and a Tukey's mUltiple range 
analysis at p<0.05. If there were no interactions between the three factors, i.e. the effect 
of one factor did not influence the effect of another factor, then a one-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey's multiple range analysis (p<0.05) were used to 
compare the means within each factor. When data did not meet the assumptions of an 
ANOVA a non parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (p<0.05) was used. 
16 2.3 Results 
Water temperature alone had a significant effect on abalone shell length gain (ANOVA: 
F(2.10S)=39.60; p<O.OO) and weight gain (ANOVA: F(2.10S)=58.43; p<O.OO) (Table 2.4). 
Abalone cultured at 18°C grew fastest (2.23±0.10 mm.month -l, 4.33±0.25 g.month-l) 
followed by those cultured at 22 and 24°C. Similarly, the final condition factor of 
abalone was significantly effected by water temperature (ANOVA: F(2,IOS)=65.89; 
p<O.OO), and was highest in abalone cultured at 18°C (1.03±0.01) decreasing 
significantly with an increase in water temperature (Table 2.4).

There were no interactions between the effects of the three factors combined, i.e. the 
effect of water temperature , dietary protein and energy on abalone shell length gain 
(multi factor ANOVA: F(8,8l)=1.68; p=O.l2) (Figure 2.4), weight gain (multifactor 
ANOVA: F(8,81)= 1.04; p=0.41 (Figure 2.5) or final condition factor (multifactor ANOV A: 
F(8,81)=0.66; p=0.73). However, there were significant interactions between the effects of 
dietary protein and dietary energy on shell length gain (multi factor ANOVA: F(4,8l)=8.51; 
p=0.0IxlO-3), weight gain (multifactor ANOVA: F(4,81)=17.05; p=0.04xlO-J) and final 
condition factor (multifactor ANOVA: F(4,8l)=7.l7; p=0.05xlO·\ The protein content of 
the diet had no significant effect on abalone shell length gain or weight gain provided the 
energy content of the diet did not drop below 13.5 MJ.kg·1 (Figures 2.6 and 2.7). Abalone 
fed the low protein low energy diet (i.e. 18 % protein; 11.6 MJ.kg-1 energy) had 
significantly lower shell length gain (0.81±0.08 mm.month-l), weight gain (0.20±0.23 
g.month·l) and final condition factor (0.92±0.01) than those fed the higher protein (22 
17 and 26 %) low energy diets with combined means of 1.38±0.15 nun.month", 1.83±0.43 
g.month" and 0.98±0.02 (Figures 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8). 
Water temperature, dietary protein and dietary energy each had a significant effect on 
abalone mortality, with no interactions between the three factors (multi factor ANOV A: 
F(8,81);1.28; p=0.26) (Figure 2.9). The rate of mortality was similar at 18 and 22°C 
(8.1±2.25 and 1O.1±2.27 % respectively) but increased significantly at 24°C (17.4±2.63 
%) (Kruskal-Wallis: H(2"o8)=13.04; p;0.002). Abalone in treatments fed the 22 and 26 % 
protein diets had similar mortality rates (8.6±1.77 and 7.6±1.60 % respectively) while 
mortalities were significantly higher at 19.4±3.21 % in treatments fed the 18 % protein 
diets (Kruskal-Wallis: H(2,'08)=9.80; p=O.OI). Similarly, mortalities were significantly 
higher for abalone fed the low energy diets (11.6 MJ.kg") (27.1±2.59 %) compared to 
those fed the 13.5 and 16.2 MJ.kg" diets with means of 4.8±1.00 and 3.8±0.91 % 
respectively (Kruskal- Wallis: H(2"o8);56.41; p<O.OO). 
There were significant interactions between dietary protein and energy in terms of feed 
consumption (multifactor ANOVA: F(4,8,);30.12; p<O.OO) (Figure 2.10). Abalone fed the 
low protein low energy diet (i.e. 18 % protein, 11.6 MJ.kg" energy) had significantly 
lower feed consumption rates (0.26±0.03 % bd.wt.day") compared to those fed the other 
diets (combined mean of 0.49±0.03 % bd.wt.day"). Abalone fed the low energy (11.6 
MJ.kg") 22 and 26 % protein diets had significantly higher feed consumption rates 
(0.53±0.04 and 0.55±0.04 % bd.wt.day" respectively) compared to those fed the high 
energy (16.2 Mlkg") 22 and 26 % diets (combined mean of 0.45±0.04 % bd.wt.day"). 
Abalone fed the 26 % protein 13.5 Mlkg" diet had significantly higher feed consumption 
(0.53±0.03 % bd.wt.day") compared to those fed the 18 % protein 13.5 MJ.kg" diet 
(0.43±0.03 % bd.wt.day"). Feed consumption decreased significantly with an increase in 
water temperature from 0.56±0.02 % bd.wt.dai' at 18°C to 0.33±0.02 % bd.wt.day" at 
24°C (ANOVA: F(2,105)=47.74; p<O.OO) (Figure 2.10).

Water temperature and dietary energy each had a significant effect on FCR, although 
there were no interactions between the three factors (multifactor ANOYA: F(7,69)=1.l8; 
p=O.32). FCR increased significantly with an increase in water temperature from 18 to 24 
°C (Kruskal-Wallis: H(2,95)=28.83; p<O.OO) (Table 2.4). FCR values were similar for 
abalone fed the high (16.2 MJ.kg,l) and medium (13.5 MJ.kil) energy diets (1.98±O.13 
and 2.l6±O.2l respectively) but increased significantly when dietary energy was reduced 
to 11.6 MJ.kg,1 (3.63±0.3l) (Kruskal-Wallis: H(2,95)=25.50; p<O.OO). Interestingly, dietary 
protein content had no effect on FCR with a combined mean of 2.48±O.24 for the three 
dietary protein levels (Kruskal-Wallis: H(2,95)=1.l2; p=O.57).

The observed rise m mortality coupled with the decline in abalone growth, food 
conversion efficiency, condition factor and feed consumption with an increase in water 
temperature from 18 to 24°C confirmed the trends observed by Britz et al. (1997) who 
reared abalone on a fishmeal /starch diet. 
While some studies have attempted to define optimal protein:energy ratios for cultured 
abalone (Britz and Hecht, 1997; Bautista-Teruel and Millamena, 1999; Gomez-Montes et 
aI., 2003; Montano-Vargas et a\., 2005), the present results support the suggestion by 
Fleming et a\. (1996) that the energy contents of commercial abalone feed formulations 
are over-specified. Published dietary energy values for formulated feeds for abalone 
range from 12.94 to 21.62 MJ.kg·1 (Mai et aI., 1995a; Mai et aI., 1995b; Bautista-Teruel 
and Millamena , 1999; Coote et aI., 2000; Durazo-Beltran et a\., 2003; Gomez-Montes et 
a\., 2003; Sales et a\., 2003; Thongrod et a\., 2003; Montano-Vargas et a\., 2005). There 
were no differences in growth or mortality between abalone fed the high (16.2 Mlkg-1) 
or medium energy (13.5 MJ.kg-1) diets. However, the poor growth and survival of 
abalone fed the low energy (11.6 Mlkg-l) diets suggests that this dietary energy level is 
insufficient to meet the energetic requirements of H midae in the size range tested here, 
or the diets were unpalatable. The three low energy diets (11.6 MJ.kg-1) had relatively 
high ash contents (30 %) in comparison to the medium (20 %) and high (5 %) energy 
diets. High ash levels in algae are due to the presence of calcium carbonate which has 
been found to limit the presence of other nutrients and reduce their uptake (Hay et aI., 
1994; Viera et a\., 2005). It is possible that the low energy diets contained high levels of 
calcium carbonate and this may explain the poor growth and survival observed. 
It is possible to reduce the protein content of formulated feeds for H midae to as low as 
18 % provided the diet contains sufficient energy (13.5 MJ.kg-1 or more). This value is 
lower than the optimal protein levels reported by other authors, for example, Bautista­
Teruel and MilJamena (1999) reduced the protein content of diets for H asinina from 32 
to 27 % by increasing the energy content of the diet from 12.94 to 13.19 MJ.kg-1 with no 
significant effect on abalone growth. Sales et a\. (2003) fed juvenile H midae diets with 
23 protein contents ranging from 5.5 to 48 %, with gross energy values of 16.0 to 17.0 
Mlkg-', and found weight gain to peak at a dietary protein content of 22 %. Coote et al. 
(2000) found that young H. laevigata grew fastest when fed a semipurified diet with a 
protein and energy content of27.4 % and 18 Mlkg-' respectively, but these growth rates 
were not significantly different to diets containing less protein but similar energy levels, 
further supporting the notion that the dietary protein level offorrnulated feeds for abalone 
may be reduced provided there is a sufficient supply of dietary energy. 
The feed consumption rates fell within the range reported for H. midae of similar sizes 
(Britz and Hecht, 1997; Shipton and Britz, 200Ib). Abalone fed the 26 % protein 13.5 
Mlkg-' diet showed higher feed consumpt ion rates and FCR compared to those fed the 
18 % protein diet with the equivalent energy level. The explanation provided by Mai et 
al. (I 995b) and Coote et al. (2000) may explain the observed trend. As the protein content 
of the diet increases the energy content of the diet does not always lDcrease 
proportionately and thus protein in the diet is catabolised into energy in order to 
breakdown and excrete the excess protein (Mai et aI., 1995a; Coote et aI., 2000). This 
may explain the higher feed consumption rate of abalone fed the 26 % protein diet 
compared to those fed the 18 % protein diet at a similar energy level, which further 
emphasises the importance of balancing the amount of dietary protein and energy in 
abalone diets. 
The higher consumption rate of abalone fed the higher protein (22 and 26 %) low energy 
(11.6 MJ.kg-') diets suggests that the abalone were consuming more food in order to 
satisfy their energetic requirements. Bautista-Teruel and Millamena (1999) observed a 
similar trend with H. asinina where abalone fed a low energy natural diet (17.56 % 
protein; 9.21 MJ.kg-' energy) displayed the highest feed conversion ratio. Similarly, 
Gomez-Montes et al. (2003) attributed differences in caloric intake for H. folgens fed 
diets ranging from 26 to 44 % protein and 16.89 to 17.26 Mlkg-' energy to a requirement 
for dietary energy. 
24 Abalone cultured at 22 and 24 ·C in the current study achieved average growth rates of 
2.09 mm.month-I; 3.33 g.month-I and 1.34 mm.month-I; 1.21 g.month-I respectively, 
provided they received a sufficient balance of dietary protein (22 -26 %) and energy 
(13.5 -16.2 MJ.kg-I). While the growth rates at 24 ·C fall below the desired rate of 2-3 
mm.month-I required by farmers (Hahn, 1989b; Fleming et al., 1996), the use of these 
diets would allow farmers to safely feed their stock during periods of elevated water 
temperatures in order to prevent abalone weight loss and mortalities that normally occur 
during these periods_ 
2.5 Conclusion 
The efficiency of feed conversion, growth rate and condition factor of H. midae fed the 
experimental diets decreased , and mortality increased , with increasing water temperature 
from 18 to 24 ·C. A dietary energy content of at least 13.5 Mlkg"1 for H. midae in the 
size range tested (50-60 mm shell length) is required for optimal growth performance . A 
dietary energy level of 11.6 Mlkg-I was insufficient to meet the energetic requirements 
of H. midae regardles s of the protein coutent of the diet. The protein content of the diet 
may be reduced to 18 % without significantly reducing growth, provided dietary energy 
is maintained at 13.5 MJ.kg·1 or more. 
25 CHAPTER 3. 
THE INFLUENCE OF BODY SIZE AND WATER TEMPERATURE ON THE 
DIETARY PROTEIN REQUIREMENTS OF FARMED SOUTH AFRICAN 
ABALONE HAL/OTIS MIDAE 
3.1 Introduction 
The protein requirements and digestive capabilities of abalone have been the primary 
focus of abalone nutritional studies as protein is the principal dietary component 
responsible for growth, and is the highest cost component in fOffilUlated feeds (Mai et a!., 
1995a; Fleming et a!., 1996). Investigations into the protein requirements of abalone have 
been undertaken for Haliotis tuberculata and Haliotis discus hannai (Mai et a!., 1995a), 
Haliotis midae (Britz, 1996a; Sales et a!., 2003) and Haliotis laevigata (Coote et a!., 
2000), but none have considered the effects of water temperature on the protein 
requirements of abalone. 
Aquaculture nutritional studies continually strive to define optimal dietary protein levels, 
i.e. the minimum dietary protein level at which growth is maximised (Wilson, 2002). 
However, in defining optimal dietary protein levels consideration of the amino acids 
profile, digestibility and energy level of the test ingredients is vital as a deficiency in one 
or more of these factors may lead to an overestimation of dietary protein requirements 
(Wilson, 2002). In addition, provision of protein from a single dietary ingredient is likely 
to lead to an overestimation (Mai et aI., 1995a; Coote et a!., 2000). Provision of sufficient 
levels of dietary energy allows the energetic requirements for maintenance and physical 
activity to be satisfied thus allowing the protein portion of the diet to be utilised 
exclusively for growth (Smith, 1989). The nse of protein as an energy source should be 
avoided not only due to the expense associated with protein but because it leads to 
deamination of the amino acids and the excretion of excess ammonia which can reduce 
water quality (Smith, 1989) and lead to complications such as outbreaks of the sabellid 
worm Terebrasabella heterouncinata (Simon et a!., 2004) or "bloat". This usually fatal 
condition is believed to be cansed by proliferation of bacteria in the digestive tract 
26 resulting in the fermentation of the gut contents and formation of gas bubbles (Macey and 
Coyne, 2005; Godoy et aI., 2006). Thus, definition of optimal dietary protein levels will 
not only result in potential economic savings through the reduction of high cost protein 
rich ingredients such as fishmeal and soya but may also produce beneficial secondary 
effects such as improvements in culture environment water quality and animal health. 
It is generally accepted that the protein requirements of fish decrease with an increase in 
body size and age (Wilson, 2002) and there is evidence to suggest that the nutritional 
requirements of abalone differ with age (Britz and Hecht, 1997; Shipton and Britz, 
200Ib). The most recent evidence for this was presented by Jones and Britz (2006) who 
found that it was possible to reduce the dietary protein content offormulated feeds for H. 
midae (> 50 mm shell length) from 34 to 26 % protein. It is likely that further reductions 
in the protein portion of formulated feeds for abalone of different sizes may be possible. 
Studies on the effects of water temperature on the protein requirements of cultured 
abalone are limited and no clear trends are evident, for example, the protein requirements 
of certain fish species have been found to be influenced by water temperature , while the 
requirements of other species are unaffected (Wilson, 2002). Temperature is the primary 
environmental factor governing the metabolic rate of poikilotherms (Fry, 1971) and H. 
midae has been found to conform to this trend (Britz et aI., 1997). Britz et aI. (1997) 
found the optimal temperature for the growth, condition factor and feed conversion ratio 
of H. midae to lie in the range of 18 to 20°C with feed consumption rates increasing 
significantly with an increase in water temperature from 12 to 20 °C. In addition, Dixon 
(1992) determined that crude protein digestibility in H. midae was significantly 
influenced by water temperature, being higher at 18°C compared to 15 and 22 0c. Since 
protein digestibility (Dixon, 1992) and feed ingestion (Britz et aI., 1997) in H. midae are 
influenced either by water temperature or body size or both it is likely that the protein 
requirements of H. midae may be affected by these factors. 
The bulk of formulated feeds currently available for H. midae were developed based on 
the results of studies conducted within the optimal temperature range (18-20 °C) for 
27 growth (Sales and Britz 2001 a). However, the bulk of abalone farming operations in 
South Africa are situated on the south coast, make use of land based pump ashore single 
pass technology, and are exposed to mean sea water temperatures of 15°C (unpublished 
data, HIK Abalone Farm (Pty) Ltd; Cook, 1998; Troell et aI., 2006). Farmers therefore 
have very little control over on-farm water temperatures which predominantl y fall below 
the optimal temperature for growth. The developm ent of temperature and size specific 
diets may assist in improving the growth of abalone cultured at cooler water 
temperatur es. 
The overall aim of the study was to investigate the size and temperature specific protein 
requirements of H midae cultured under laboratory and on-farm conditions in an attempt 
to reduce feed production costs and complication s associated with high protein diets. 
The objectives of the study were to compare the growth, survival and nutritional indices 
of H midae of different sizes (15 mm, 50 mm and 80 mm) cultured at temperatures that 
are predominantly experienced on land-based abalone farming operations situated in 
temperate regions (i.e. 14, 16 and 18°C), and fed formulated feeds containing graded 
levels of dietary protein (20,26,32,38 and 44 %) under laboratory and farm conditions . 
3.2. Materials and methods 
3.2.1 Experimental diets 
Two suites of experimental diets were formulated to contain graded levels of crude 
dietary protein for three size classes of abalone. Three diets with protein contents of 
either 32, 38 or 44 % were formulated for the small abalone (15 mm shell length), while 
four diets with protein contents of either 20, 26, 32 and 38 % were formulated for the 
larger size classes (i.e. 50 and 80 mm shell length) (Table 3.1). Low temperature stearn 
dried, formaldehyde free, mackerel fishmeal (Oceana (Ply) Ltd, South Africa) was the 
primary protein source in the diets for the small abalone. The same fishmeal, as well as 
soya-oil cake were the primary protein sources in the diets formulated for the larger 
abalone. The diets for the larger abalone also included fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima). 
Each suite of diets was formulated to contain similar amounts of dietary energy and lipid. 
28 The two suites of diets contained the same inclusion level of a vitamin and mineral 
mixture (Vitamin mineral premix, BASF Animal Nutrition (Pty) Ltd, South Africa) and 
starch carbohydrates based on a proprietary commercial formulation (Marifeed (Pty) Ltd, 
South Africa), Diatomaceous earth replaced starch as a non-nutritive filler in order to 
balance the energy levels ofthe diets, 
The digestible energy coefficients of the dietary ingredients were calculated according to 
the methods described in Chapter 2,

methods of the AOAC (2003) using the methods described in Chapter 2, 
3,2,2 Experiment }: Laboratory growth trial 
3.2,2,} Experimental system, animals, acclimation andfeeding 
The experiment was conducted at the Rhodes University Port Alfred Marine Research 
Laboratory (33°45'S; 26°00'E) in the same partially recirculating experimental systems 
described in Chapter 2, The water temperature in each of the experimental systems was 
set at either 14, 16 or 18°C, Tanks were cleaned once a week by siphoning settled 
29 sediment from the tank bottom and 10 % of the entire system's volume was replaced 
daily with seawater (35 g.L-1) pumped from the Kowie River estuary. 
The three size classes of abalone (i.e. 15, 50 and 80 mm) were obtained from two 
commercial abalone farms (Table 3.2) situated on the south coast of South Africa where 
they had previously been fed artificial feeds. The abalone were stocked into the baskets at 
size dependent stocking densities (Table 3.2) and allowed to acclimate to the 
experimental systems for five weeks before the start of the trial. They were fed size 
specific locally produced commercial abalone feeds and kept at 18°C during acclimation 
(Table 3.2). There were no differences in the shell length, weight or condition factor of 
the abalone in the different treatments within each size class (i.e. 15, 50 and 80 mm) at 
the start of the trial (ANOVA: p>0.05) (Tables 3.4, 3.6 and 3.8). The water temperatures 
were lowered by I °C every 24 h at the start of the trial until experimental systems 
reached the required temperatures.

The experimental diets were assigned to baskets using a randomised block design to 
ensure that each diet was fed to three baskets of abalone in each of the three size classes 
at each of the three temperatures. Thus each diet was replicated three times for each size 
class at each of the three temperature regimes. In addition, the block design ensured that 
each diet was positioned in each of the three tanks in each system run at the different 
temperatures. 
30 Abalone were fed to apparent satiation at 16hOO six days a week. Food consumption was 
recorded for the abalone in each basket for the duration of the trial. Uneaten food was 
removed within 24 h and frozen at _4°C. It was later oven dried at 100°C for 24 hand 
then weighed at the end of the trial. 
3.2.2.2 Solid leaching of diets 
Leaching rates were calculated according to the methods described in Chapter 2. There 
were four replicate samples for each diet at each of the three temperatures. 
3.2.2.3 Data collection 
Animals were purged for a 24 h prior to the weigh and measure processes. The abalone 
were subsequently anaesthetised and weighed and measured according to the methods 
described in Chapter 2. All the 50 and 80 mm abalone in each basket were individually 
weighed and measured at the start and end of the 12 week growth trial. The total biomass 
of the abalone in each basket containing the 15 mm abalone was recorded and a random 
sample of75 abalone were individually weighed and measured at the start and end of the 
trial. 
Mean abalone shell length gam and weight gain were calculated for all treatments. 
Condition factor, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and feed consumption were calculated 
according to Britz (l996b) using the equations 1-5 in Chapter 2. Protein efficiency ratio 
(PER) was calculated according to Britz (1996b) using the equation: 
Protein efficiency ratio = grams wet weight gain/grams protein consumed (6) 
The baskets were checked for mortalities three times a week and any dead abalone were 
recorded and removed. 
3.2.2.4: Water chemistry 
Temperature and pH readings were recorded twice a day using a digital temperature and 
pH probe (Hanna Instruments, HI 98128, Woonsocket, USA). Salinity was monitored 
31 using a refractometer (Extech Instruments, RF20, Waltham, USA). Ammonia and nitrite 
were measured twice a week using colourmetric titration kits (Red Sea Fish Pharm, 
Houston, USA). Free unionised ammonia (FAN) was calculated based on total ammonia 
nitrogen readings (TAN), temperature, pH and salinity values according to Bower and 
Bidwell (1978). Water chemistry data for the 12 week trial is summarised in Table 3.3.

The effect of dietary protein content and water temperature on abalone shell length gain, 
weight gain, final condition factor, mortality, FCR, feed consumption and PER were 
compared using a two-way analysis of variance (multifactor ANOVA) and a Tukey's 
multiple range analysis at p<0.05. If there were no interactions between these factors a 
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey's multiple range analysis (p<0.05) 
were used to compare means within each factor. Data that did not meet the assumptions 
of an ANOVA were analysed using a non parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (p<0.05). 
3.2.3 Experiment 2 On-farm growth 
3.2.3.1: Experimental system, animals and feeding 
The trial was carried out HIK Abalone Farm (Pty) Ltd situated on the south coast of 
South Africa. Abalone were cultured in eleven 3000 L canvas tanks (4 m x I m x 0.8 m; 
length, width and depth). Each tank contained six oyster mesh baskets (95 cm x 55 cm x 
60 cm; length, width and depth), and each basket included a vertical Acrylonitrile 
butadiene styrene plastic rack (total surface area: 3.28 m2baskerl) and a horizontal 
feeding plate positioned 5 -10 cm below the water surface. The total volume of each 
32 tank was exchanged every 2.5 h and aeration was provided by airlines installed below the 
baskets along the length of each tank. The tanks were cleaned once a week by siphoning 
settled sediment from the tank bottom. All the tanks were positioned outside and exposed 
to a natural photoperiod of approximately 12:12 (L:D). 
All abalone used in the growth trial had previously been fed Abfeed®-S34 (34 % protein, 
2 % lipid). The abalone were stocked into baskets according to standard farm stocking 
methods: the 10-15 mm ahalone were stocked at 2200 animals per basket (0.00 I kgr' 
per tank), while the 50 and 80 mm abalone were stocked at 13 % (0.01 kg.L-' per tank) 
and 18 % (0.02 kg.L-' per tank) of the available surface area in the basket respectively. 
There were no differences in the shell length, weight or condition factor of the abalone in 
the different treatments within each size class at the start of the trial with the exception of 
the initial condition factor of the 80 mm abalone (ANOYA: p>0.05) (Tables 3.10, 3.11 
and 3.12). Abalone in the 38 % protein diet treatment had a higher initial condition factor 
(1.l1±0.01) compared to those in the 26 and 32 % dietary protein treatments (1.08±0.01) 
(ANOYA: F(J,20)=3.39; p=O.04). 
Abalone were fed the same diets used in the laboratory growth trial (Table 3.1). They 
were fed to apparent satiation at approximately 16hOO every day according to standard 
farm feeding methods. Each diet was assigned to six baskets of abalone using a 
randomised block design. Thus there were six replicates of each diet for each abalone 
size class. The diets were assigned to the baskets to ensure that each diet was represented 
at least once in each of the tanks in each size class. 
3.2.3.2: Data collection 
The abalone were anaesthetised prior to all the weigh and measure processes according to 
standard farm procedures. The IS and 50 mm abalone were anaesthetised with a 10 % 
magnesium sulphate solution and the 80 mm abalone were anaesthetised using carbon 
dioxide gas which was bubbled into solution. Twelve 10-15 mm abalone were randomly 
selected from each basket during the weigh and measure at the start of the trial and were 
individually marked with numbered bee tags. These were attached to the shell of each 
33 abalone using super glue. Each tagged abalone was then individually weighed (0.0 I g) 
and measured (0.01 mm). Similarly, ten 50 mm and ten SO mm abalone were randomly 
selected from each basket at the start of the trial and marked by placing a piece of epoxy 
putty (Pratley's Putty® Original, Krugersdorp, South Africa) onto the shell of each 
abalone. These abalone were also individually weighed (0.01 g) and measured (0.01 
mm). In addition, the total weight of each basket was recorded. 
All three size classes of abalone were weighed and measured after 12 and 24 weeks using 
the same methods described above. The stocking densities in the 50 mm and SO mm 
baskets were adjusted during this period in order to maintain a stocking density of 13 and 
IS % respectively, which is standard farm practice. This was done by randomly removing 
non-tagged animals from the baskets. The tagged abalone were weighed and measured 
and the basket weights recorded after 24 weeks which marked the end of the trial. 
Food weights were recorded for each diet fed to each size class of abalone. A single 
weight was obtained for each diet fed to the six replicates of each abalone size class. 
Mean abalone shell length gain and weight gain were calculated for all treatments. 
Condition factor was calculated using Equation 1 in Chapter 2. FCR and PER were 
calculated for the 10-15 and 50 mm size class treatments using equation 2 in Chapter 2 
and equation 6. 
3.2.3.3: Water chemistry 
The temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH of the incoming farm seawater was recorded 
daily using digital dissolved oxygen (YSI Incorporated 55D, Yellow Springs, USA), pH 
and temperature (YSI Incorporated 60/10FT, Yellow Springs, USA) probes. The mean (± 
standard deviation) temperature of the incoming farm seawater during the period of the 
trial was 14.7±1.65 °C ranging from 10.3 to 17.3 °C. Dissolved oxygen and pH averaged 
S.16±0.56 mg.L-1 and 7.62±0.25 respectively. 
34 3.2.3.4: Statistical analysis 
The effect of dietary protein content on abalone shell length gain, weight gain, condition 
factor, FCR and PER were compared using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
and a Tukey's multiple range analysis (p<O.05). 
3.3 Results 
3.3.1.1 Experiment 1: Laboratory growth: Interaction of dietary protein content and 
water temperature on abalone growth and nutritional indices 
There were no interactions between dietary protein content and water temperature on 
abalone shell length gain, weight gain, final condition factor, mortality, FCR, feed 
consumption or PER for all three size classes of abalone (multi factor ANOV A: p>O.05). 
3.3.1.2 Experiment 1: 15 mm Abalone 
Dietary protein did not affect the shel! length gam (ANOVA: F(2,24)=1.78; p=O.l9), 
weight gain (ANOVA: F(2,24)=1.47; p=0.25) or final condition factor (ANOVA: 
F(2,24)=O.1l; p=O.90) of the abalone in the different treatments (Table 3.4). Abalone 
cultured at 18°C had higher weight gain (O.13±O.O.OI g.month") compared to those 
cultured at 14°C (O.09±O.OI g.month") (ANOVA: F(2,24)=8.31; p=O.002) (Table 3.5). 
However, abalone cultured at 14°C had a higher final condition factor compared to those 
cultured at 18 °C (ANOVA: F(2,24)=3.87; p=O.04) (Table 3.5). 
Dietary protein content did not affect abalone mortality (Kruskal-Wal!is: H(2,27)=1.52; 
p=0.47) (Table 3.4). However, the rate of mortality was significantly higher at 14°C 
(4.l±O.8 %) compared to 18°C (1.5±O.3 %) (Kruskal-Wal!is: H(2,27)=8.22; p=O.02) (Table

FCR and feed consumption rates were unaffected by the independent effects of dietary 
protein content (Kruskal -WaJlis: H(2,27)=1.41; p=0.49 and ANOVA : F(2,24)=2.10; p=O.14 
respectively) and water temperature (Kruskal-Wallis: H(2,27)=4.17; p=O.12 and ANOVA: 
F(2.24)=1.86; p=O.lS respectively) (Tables 3.4 and 3.5). However , PER decreased 
significantly with an increase in dietary protein content from 1.94±O.17 for abalone fed 
35 the 32 % protein diet to 1.46±O.11 and 1.44±O.12 for those fed the 38 and 44 % protein 
diets respectively (ANOVA: F(2,24}=4.3S; p=O.02) (Table 3.4). The PER values were

Shell length gain (ANOYA: F(J,32)=3,83; p=O.02) and weight gain (ANOYA: F(l,J2)=7.28; 
p=O.OO 1) increased significantly with an increase in dietary protein content. Abalone fed 
the 38 % protein diet had significantly higher weight gain (2.13±O,IS g.month·1) 
compared to those fed the 20 and 26 % protein diets (1.33±0.14 and l.S4±0.12 g.month·1 
respectively) (Table 3.6), Water temperature had a significant effect on shell length gain 
(ANOYA: F(2,J3)=9.24; p=O.OOI) and weight gain (ANOYA: F(2,JJ)=4,69; p=0.02). 
Abalone cultured at 18°C had significantly higher weight gain (1.99±0.14 g,month·1) 
compared to those cultured at 14°C (1.43±0.11 g.month·1) (Table 3,7), However, the 
final condition factor of abalone cultured at 14 and 16°C was significantly higher than 
those cultured at 18 °C (ANOYA: F(2,JJ)=S.70; p=O.OI) (Table 3,7), 
Neither dietary protein content (Kruskal-Wallis: H(l,J6)=1.48; p=0,69) nor water 
temperature (Kruska1-Wallis: H(2,J6)=4.l8; p=0.12) affected the abalone mortality rate 
(Tables 3.6 and 3,7), 
FCR's were not affected by dietary protein content (Kruskal-Wallis: H(l,J6)=2.31; p=O,SI) 
(Table 3.6). However, temperature did have an affect, with significantly lower FCR's 
recorded at 18°C (1.38±O.06) compared to 14°C (1.86±0.16) (Kruskal-Wallis: 
H(2,J6)=7.14; p=0.03) (Table 3.7). Feed consumption rates increased significantly with an 
increase in dietary protein content from O,29±0.02 % for abalone fed the 20 % protein 
diet to 0.38±0.01 % for those fed the 38 % protein diet (ANOYA: F(l,32)=3,74; p=0.02) 
(Figure 3.1). PER was significantly higher for abalone fed the 20 % protein diet 
(3.09±O.23) compared to those fed the 32 and 38 % protein diets (2.24±0.11 and 
1.81±0.12 respectively) (ANOYA: F(l,J2)=6.76; p=O.OOl) (Table 3.6). While feed 
consumption (ANOYA: F(2,J3)=0, II; p=0.89) and PER (ANOYA: F(3,3J)=L58; p=0.22) 
values were similar for abalone cultured at the different temperatures (Table 3.7),

Non-overlapping confidence intervals indicate significant differences (ANOY A: 
F(J,32)=3.74; p=0.02). 
3.3.1.3 Experiment 1: 80 mm Abalone 
Dietary protein content had no effect on shell length gain (ANOYA: F(J, 32)=1.65; 
p=0.20), weight gain (ANOYA: F(J, 32)=1.27; p=0.30) or final condition factor (ANOYA: 
F(3, 32)=0.42; p=0.74). Although not significant growth was lower for abalone fed the 20 
% protein diet (Table 3.8). Abalone cultured at 18 °C had significantly higher sheUlength 
gain (1.26±0.07 mm.month -') compared to those cultured at cooler temperatur es with a 
combined mean of 1.02±0.07 mm.month- ' (ANOYA: F(2,33)=4.51; p=0.02) (Table 3.9). 
Weight gain did not differ significantly between temperature treatments (ANOYA: 
F(2,33)=1.62; p=0.21), and there were no significant differences in the final condition 
factor of the abalone cultured at the different temperatures (ANOYA: F(2,33)=3.38; 
p=0.05) (Table 3.9). 
39 Neither dietary protein content (Kruskal-Wallis: H(3,36)=3.l9; p=0.36) nor water 
temperature (Kruskal-Wallis : H(3,36)=2.S8; p=0.27) affected the rate of mortality (Tables 
3.8 and 3.9). 
Dietary protein content did not affect FCR (Kruskal-Walli s: H(3,36)=4.SI; p=0.21) or feed 
consumption rates (ANOYA: F(3,32)=1.27; p=0.30) (Table 3.8). Abalone cultured at 14°C 
displayed significantly higher FCR's (1.61±0.14) compared to those cultured at 16°C 
(l.21±O.l2) (Kruskal-Wallis: H(2,36)=6.37; p=0.04). Abalone feed consumption rates were 
similar at all temperatures (ANOYA: F(2,33)=1.23; p=O.3I). PER decreased significantly 
with an increase in dietary protein content from 3.89±0.37 and 3.44±0.44 for the 20 and 
26 % protein diets respectively to 1. 79±O.l6 for the 38 % protein diet (ANOY A: 
F(3,32)=8.21; p=0.0003) (Table 3.8). PER values were unaffected by differences in water

3.4 Discussion 
The study attempted to determine the size and temperature specific protein requirements 
of H. midae based on the response of abalone cultured at different temperatures to 
increasing levels of dietary protein. The growth of the SO mm abalone increased 
significantly in response to increasing levels of dietary protein while the growth of the IS 
and 80 mm abalone was independent of dietary protein content which is contrary to the 
43 results of a number protein based studies on abalone (Mai et aI., 1995a; Britz, 1996a; 
Coote et aI., 2000; Sales et a!., 2003). 
The growth rates obtained during both the laboratory and farm trials were well below 
average which indicates that the abalone were not realising the maximum growth 
potential possible under the prevailing water temperature conditions. Thus, 
recommendations on defining "optimal" dietary protein levels were not possible. The 
growth rates obtained during the farm trial (i.e. 1.5 to 2.0 mm.month-I) fell below the 
average rates required by commercial farming operations (2-3 mm.month-I) (Fleming et 
a!., 1996). This did not appear to be linked to the experimental conditions, as it was 
established that abalone farms were experiencing a period of below average growth rates 
over the same period as the trial (G. Johnson, HIK Abalone Farm (Pty) Ltd, personal 
communication). The growth rates obtained from the laboratory trial were particularly 
poor, suggesting that the abalone used were from a poor batch of animals. It has been 
found that abalone that grow poorly initially do not recover later in life (Haaker et a!., 
1998). Slower growing abalone would have a lower rate of protein deposition and thus 
the increases in dietary protein did not result in an increase in growth as protein was not 
limiting in terms of protein deposition rates. Definition of an optimal dietary protein level 
is the point at which growth is maximised with the minimum amount of dietary protein 
(Wilson, 2002). Since growth rates in the current study were below average, the 
definition of optimal dietary protein levels for H. midae of different sizes were not 
possible. 
Growth and feed consumption rates of the 50 mm abalone in the laboratory trial increased 
in response to increasing levels of dietary protein. It is possible that the lower 
consumption and resultant lower growth rate of abalone fed the 20 % protein diet could 
be linked to a protein/energy imbalance or an attractiveness /palatability complication. 
The increase in growth in response to increasing water temperature for abalone cultured 
in the laboratory trial was expected since temperature is the principle environmenta l 
factor governing the metabolic rate of poikilotherms (Fry, 1971). A similar finding was 
44 reported by Britz et al. (1997), where abalone growth rates increased with an increase in 
water temperature from 12 to 20°C. Similarly, the growth of H. iris was found to 
increase with an increase in water temperature from 14 to 22°C (Searle et aI., 2006). 
The higher condition factor of abalone cultured at cooler water temperatures in the 
laboratory growth trial is evidence that abalone cultured at cooler water temperatures 
were investing more energy into body growth in relation to shell growth. Britz et al. 
(1997) reported a similar trend and suggested that the maintenance requirements of H. 
midae are reduced when they are cultured cooler temperatures and a greater proportion of 
energy is channelled into glycogen reserves. However, further studies on the effect of 
water temperature on the nutritional content of abalone tissue are required before this can 
be confirmed. 
The effects of dietary protein content and water temperature on abalone growth were 
independent of one another. Thus the protein requirements of H. midae were not affected 
by water temperature within the ranges of water temperatures and dietary protein contents 
tested in this study. Although the protein requirements of some fish species have been 
found to be influenced by water temperature (Wilson, 2002), it seems that the dietary 
protein requirements of abalone are independent of water temperature within the ranges 
tested here. This is a promising result as it indicates that land-based farms exposed to 
temperate water conditions (14 -18°C) need not adjust the protein content of abalone 
feeds in response to changing water temperatures. 
Protein efficiency ratio (PER) measures the efficiency of abalone to convert dietary 
protein into body weight. Interestingly, PER values were similar at different temperatures 
further supporting the possibility that water temperatures within the range tested here do 
not affect the protein requirements of H. midae. A similar trend was observed by Britz et 
al. (1997) for juvenile H. midae cultured at temperatures in the ranges of this study. PER 
values decreased significantly with an increase in dietary protein content for all the size 
classes of abalone in the range tested here. This is consistent with past research where 
PER values of juvenile H. midae declined from 3.2 on a 27 % protein diet to 2.3 on a 47 
45 % protein diet (Britz, 1996a). Although higher levels of dietary protein increased growth 
it is vital in an aquaculture context to weigh the costs of increasing dietary protein against 
the resultant increase in growth (Britz, 1996a). 
5. Conclusion 
The effects of dietary protein content and water temperatur e on the growth of H. midae 
are independ ent indicating that the protein requirements of abalone are temperature 
independent within the ranges tested in this study. Definition of optimal dietary protein 
levels for H. midae of different sizes was not possible due to the below average growth 
rates obtained from both the laboratory and farm trials. 
46 CHAPTER 4. 
SIZE SPECIFIC DIETARY LIPID AND PROTEIN REQUIREMENTS OF 
FARMED SOUTH AFRICAN ABALONE HALIOTIS MIDAE 
4.1 Introduction 
Protein has been the primary focus of abalone nutritional studies since it is principal 
dietary ingredient responsible for growth, and it is the highest cost component formulated 
feeds (Mai et aI., 1995a; Fleming et aI., 1996). However, recent evidence suggests that 
the protein requirements of abalone are influenced by the amount of available dietary 
energy (Bautista-Teruel and Millamena, 1999; Coote et aI., 2000; Sales et aI., 2003; Jones 
and Britz, 2006), and recent research showed that it was possible to reduce the protein 
content of a formulated feed for H. midae from 26 to 18 % provided the energy content of 
the diet was maintained at 13.5 MJ.kg-1 (Chapter 2). Further reduction s in the protein 
portion of formulated feeds may be possible provided there is a sufficient supply of 
energy in the diet. 
Lipids have the potential to playa key role as an ingredient in formulated feeds as they 
offer a highly concentrated source of energy, are vital for the provision of essential fatty 
acids and provide a number of precursors required for growth and gonad maturation (Mai 
et aI., 1995b; Nelson et aI., 2002). Dietary lipid studies have been carried out on species 
including Haliotis tuberculata and Haliotis discus hannai (Mai et ai., 1995b), Haliotis 
midae (Britz and Hecht, 1997), Haliotis asinina (Thongrod et aI., 2003), Haliotisfulgens 
(Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2003; Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2004) and Haliotis corrugata 
(Montano-Vargas et aI., 2005). However, high levels of dietary lipid have been found to 
negatively affect growth and reduce the uptake of other nutrients in the diet (Van 
Barneveld et aI., 1998). The inability of abalone to utilise high levels of dietary lipids has 
been linked to the low levels oflipases detected in the digestive tracts of abalone (Mercer 
et aI., 1993; Britz et ai., 1996; Fleming et aI., 1996; Knauer et aI., 1996; Garcia-Esquivel 
and Felbeck, 2006). However, recent findings have detected the presence oflipases in the 
digestive tracts of juvenile abalone and high levels of lipid are present in many diatoms, 
which suggests that lipids may playa role in the nutrition of juvenile abalone as an 
47 energy source (Johnston et aI., 2005; Esterhuizen, et al. unpublished data). In addition to 
this, the nutritional requirements of H. midae have been found to be influenced by size 
(Britz and Hecht, 1997; Shipton and Britz, 2001). It is possible that lipids may serve as an 
important role as an energy source in abalone feeds. Therefore, it was hypothesised that 
lipids have a role to playas an energy source in abalone diets, and it is possible that the 
ability of abalone to utilise lipids as a source of energy differs in the presence of varying 
levels of dietary protein. 
The overall aim of the study was to investigate the utilisation of dietary lipid and protein 
of two size classes of H. midae (30 and 60 mm mean initial shell length), in order to 
determine the extent to which abalone are able to utilise dietary lipids as an energy source 
and whether further reductions in the protein portion of formulated feeds are possible. 
The objectives of the study were addressed through three hypotheses: 
I. Abalone growth and survival can be improved through the provision of increased 
dietary lipid levels at a constant P:E (protein: energy) ratio. 
2. The ability of abalone to utilise dietary lipids is influenced by the interaction 
between high and low dietary protein levels in relation to high and low lipid 
levels. 
3. Dietary protein content can be reduced provided that the energy content of the 
diet is maintained, through the manipulat ion oflipid levels. 
4.2 Materials and methods 
4.2.1 Experimental system 
The experiment was conducted at the Rhodes University Port Alfred Marine Research 
Laboratory (33°45'S; 26°00'E) in two of the temperature controlled partially recirculating 
experimental systems described in Chapter 2. The delivery and drainage plumbing of the 
two systems were joined to allow water to mix between the systems to ensure similar 
water chemistry conditions. 
48 The water temperature in the experimental system was maintained at 18 ·C usmg 
thermostatically controlled submerged heaters (three kW). The tanks were cleaned once a 
week by siphoning settled sediment from the tank bottom. Water was recirculated within 
each of the experimental systems so that the entire volume of the three abalone holding 
tanks was exchanged every two hours and 10 % of the entire system's volume was 
replaced daily with sea water (35 g.L"') pumped from the Kowie River estuary. 
4.2.2.1 Experimental diets 
Three suites of experimental diets were formulated to contain graded levels of dietary 
lipid and protein. Low temperature steam dried, formaldehyde free, mackerel fishmeal 
(Oceana (Pty) Ltd, South Africa) and calcium caseinate (Chempure (Pty) Ltd, South 
Africa) were the primary protein sources in all the experimental diets. Fish oil (Oceana 
(Ply) Ltd, South Africa) served as the dietary lipid source. Each diet contained the same 
inclusion level of a vitamin and mineral mixture (Vitamin mineral premix, BASF Animal 
Nutrition (Ply) Ltd, South Africa) and fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima). The diets also 
contained starch carbohydrates based on a proprietary commercial formulation (Marifeed 
(Ply) Ltd, South Africa). 
The digestible energy values of fishmeal, carbohydrates and kelp were calculated using 
the digestible energy coefficients described in Chapter 2. The digestibility energy 
coefficient of casein for H. midae was not available so the valne was estimated based on 
an average of the digestibility coefficients determined for H. rubra and H. laevigata by 
Vandepeer and Van Barneveld (2003). 
4.2.2.2 Experiment 1: Abalone growth and survival can be improved through the 
provision of increased dietary lipid levels at a constant P:E ratio 
Five diets were formulated to contain graded levels of dietary lipid (4, 7, 10, 13 and 16 
%) and protein (34, 35, 36, 38 and 39 %) (Table 4.1). The protein contents of the diets 
were increased as the levels of dietary lipid increased in order to maintain a constant P:E 
ratio (Table 4.1). 
49 4.2.2.3 Experiment 2: The ability of abalone to utilise dietary lipids is influenced by the 
interaction between high and low dietary protein levels in relation to high and low lipid 
levels 
Four diets were formulated to contain a combination of either 34 or 39 % dietary protein, 
each with a dietary lipid content of either 4 or 16 % (Table 4.2).

The proximal composition of the experimental diets were measured using the standard 
methods of the AOAC (2003) using the methods described in Chapter 2. 
4.2.5 Experimental animals, acclimation andfeeding 
The 30 mm abalone were obtained from HIK Abalone Farm (Pty) Ltd which is situated 
on the south coast where they had previously been fed Abfeed® S-34 (Marifeed (Pty) 
Ltd, South Africa). The 60 mm abalone were obtained from Marine Growers Abalone 
Farm (Pty) Ltd which is situated on the south east coast where they had previously been 
fed a combination of cultured algal and formulated diets. The abalone were stocked into 
the baskets at 7 and 9 % of available basket surface area (i.e. 200 and 36 abalone per 
basket for the 30 and 60 mm abalone respectively) and allowed to acclimate to the 
experimenta l systems for five weeks before the start of the trial, at a water temperature of 
51 18°C. Both size classes of abalone were fed Abfeed®-S34K during acclimation. The 
mean initial shell length, weight and condition factor were similar for the abalone within 
the two size classes allocated to each of the three experiments at the start of the trial 
(p>O.OS) with the exception of the condition factor of the 30 mm abalone allocated to 
Experiment 3 (Students t-test=3.12; p=0.02) (Tables 4.4, 4.6 and 4.8).

The diets were assigned to the abalone in the baskets using a randomised block design to 
ensure that each diet was fed to four baskets of abalone of each size class. The block 
design ensured that the four replicate samples of each treatment were positioned in a 
different tank and the two size classes of abalone were divided evenly among the tanks. 
Abalone were fed to apparent satiation at 16hOO every day except Sundays. Food 
consumption was recorded within each basket for the duration of the trial. Uneaten food 
was removed within 24 h and stored at _4°C until the end of the trial. The uneaten food 
was then oven dried at 100°C for 24 h and then weighed. 
4.2.6 Solid leaching of diets 
Leaching rates were calculated according to the methods described in Chapter 2. 
52 4.2.7 Data collect ion 
Abalone were purged for 24 h prior to being weighed and measured. The abalone were 
subsequentl y anaesthetised and weighed and measured using the methods described in 
Chapter 2. All the 60 mm abalone in each basket were individually weighed and 
measured at the start and end of the 12 week trial. The total biomass of the abalone in 
each basket containing the 30 mm abalone was recorded and a random sample of 50 
abalone were individually weighed (0.01 g) and measured (0.01 mm) at the start and end 
of the trial. 
Mean abalone shell length gam, specific growth rate (SGR), condition factor, feed 
conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed consumption were 
calculated for all treatments according to Britz (l996b) using the equations 1-6 in 
Chapters 2 and 3. 
The baskets were checked for mortalities three times a week and any dead abalone were 
recorded and removed. 
4.2.8 Biochemical composition of body tissues 
The soft tissue glycogen content of the two size classes of abalone was measured at the 
end of the trial. Soft tissue glycogen content was measured in quadruplet (i.e. a tissue 
sample was taken from one abalone from each of the four baskets fed each of the test 
diets). The soft tissue was removed from the shell by cutting the abductor mnscle away as 
close to the shell as possible. The whole body of the 30 mm abalone was retained while 
the organs and excess tissue of the 60 mm abalone was trimmed away from the foot 
muscle and only the foot muscle was retained. The tissue samples were then frozen in 
liquid nitrogen and then stored at -4 ·C until required. These samples were subsequently 
thawed and homogenised with triple distilled water (1:1) using a homogeniser (Ika Ultra 
Turrax ® T25, Staufen, Germany). 
53 Soft tissue glycogen content was measured using a method adapted from (Woodcock and 
Benkendorff, 200S). Soft tissue (200 mg) was reacted with 1.0 ml of 0.6 M perchloric 
acid for thirty min in a I.S ml reaction tube. The samples were then centrifuged at 10 000 
rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (600 fll) was then decanted into a new I.S ml reaction 
tube and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for a further five min. The supernatant (77 fll) was 
then reacted with SOO fll (hKI) reagent for 20 min in a new I.S ml reaction tube. Samples 
(200 fll) were subsequently decanted in duplicate into a micro titre plate. Absorbance of 
the solution was recorded using a 96 microtitre spectrophotometer (PowerWave X, 
Biotek Instruments, USA) at 460 nm. Glycogen concentration was determined using a 
standard curve prepared with oyster glycogen (Sigma Chemicals, USA). 
4.2.9 Water chemistry 
Water temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured once a day using a digital 
temperature and pH probe (Hanna Instruments, HI 9S128, Woonsocket, USA) and a 
dissolved oxygen probe (Hanna Instruments HI 9143, Woonsocket, USA). Salinity was 
monitored once a week using a refractometer (Extech Instruments, RF20, Waltham, 
USA). Ammonia and nitrite were measured twice a week using colourmetric titration kits 
(Red Sea Fish Pharm, Houston, USA). Free un ionised ammonia (FAN) was calculated 
based on total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), temperature, pH and salinity according to 
Bower and Bidwell (1978). Water chemistry data for the 12 week trial is summarised in 
Table 4.S. 
Table 4.S: Mean (± standard error) temperature (n=75), pH (n=41), dissolved oxygen 
(n=33), ammonia (n=19), nitrite (n=19) and salinity (n=12) readings recorded in the two

A multi factor analysis of variance (multifactor ANOVA) was used to determine if there 
were interactions between factors (p<0.05). If there were no interactions hetween factors 
a one way analysis of variance (ANOV A) and a Tukey's multiple range analysis or a 
Student's t-test were used to compare the treatment means within each factor (p<0.05). 
Data that did not meet the assumptions of an ANOV A were analysed using either a 
Mann-Whitney U test or a Krukal-Wallis ANOVA (p<0.05). Multiple linear regression 
analysis was used to correlate condition factor to dietary lipid content. 
4.3 Results 
4.3.1 Experiment I: Abalone growth and survival can be improved through the provision 
of increased dietary lipid levels at a constant PeE ratio 
The response in shell length gain (multifactor ANOVA: p=0.84), SGR (multi factor 
ANOVA: p=0.74), final condition factor (multi factor ANOVA : p=O.92), soft tissue 
glycogen content (multifactor ANOVA: p=0.06), mortality (multi factor ANOVA: 
p=0.52), feed consumption (multifactor ANOV A: p=0.20) , FeR (multifactor ANOVA: 
p=0.62) and PER (multifactor ANOVA: p=0.70) was similar for both size classes. 
Abalone shell length gain decreased significantl y with an increase in dietary lipid content 
from 4 to 16 % for both the 30 mm (ANOVA: F(4,15)=3.l6; p=0.05) and 60 mm abalone 
(ANOVA: F(4,15)=8.16; p=O.OOl; Tahle 4.6). Although not significant the SGR of the 30 
mm abalone decreased with an increase in dietary lipid content (ANOVA: F(4,15)=2.77; 
p=0.07). However, the SGR of the 60 mm abalone decreased significan tly from 
O.l8±0.02 % body weight per day (bd.wt.d·l) for abalone fed the 4 % lipid diet down to 
0.06±0.03 % bd.wt.d·1 for those fed the 16 % lipid diet (ANOVA: F(4,15)=3.40; p=0.04; 
Table 4.6). Mortality was unaffected by dietary lipid content for both the 30 mrn 
(Kruskal-Wallis: H(4,2o)=2.97; p=0.56) and 60 mm abalone (Kruskal-Wallis: H(4,2o)=4.94; 
p=0.29; Table 4.6).

Dietary lipid content did not affect the final condition factor (ANOY A: F(4,15)=0.S2; 
p=O.S3) or soft tissue glycogen (ANOYA: F(4,15)=2.61; p=O.OS) content of the 30 mm 
abalone. In addition, there was no trend between the effect of increasing levels of dietary 
lipid on the final condition factor of the 30 mm abalone (T(l,18)=-1.42; r2=0.10; p=O.l7). 
S6 The final condition factor of the 60 mm abalone did not differ significantly (ANOV A: 
F(4,15)=2.19; p=0.12), however, there was a significant trend of decreasing condition 
factor with an increase in dietary lipid content (T(l,18)=-2.SS; r2=0.31; p=O.OI). There was 
a corresponding significant reduction in the soft tissue glycogen content of the foot 
muscle from 4.00±0.12 % for abalone fed the 4 % lipid diet down to 2.14±0.76 % for 
those fed the 16 % lipid diet was recorded (ANOVA: F(4,15)=2.S9; p=0.05; Table 4.6). 
Feed consumption rates and FCR increased significantly with an increase in dietary lipid 
content for both the 30 mm (ANOVA: F(4,15)=3.5S; p=0.03 and Kruskal- Wallis: 
H(4,2o)=17.39; p=0.002 respectively) and 60 mm abalone (ANOVA: F(4,15r4.77; p=O.OI 
and Kruskal-Wallis : H(4,19)=10.S2; p=0.03 respectively). PER decreased significantly as 
the protein content of the diet increased from 34 to 39 % for both the 30 mm (ANOVA: 
F(4,15)=26.35; p<O.OO) and 60 mm abalone (ANOVA: F(4,15)=5.72; p=0.005; Table 4.6). 
4.3.2 Experiment 2: The ability of abalone to utilise dietary lipids is influenced by the 
interaction between high and low dietary protein levels in relation to high and low lipid 
levels 
There were no interactions between the effects of the three factors combined (i,e, abalone 
size, dietary protein content and dietary lipid content) for shell length gain (multi factor 
ANOVA: p=O,OS), SGR (multifactor ANOVA: p=0.2S), final condition factor 
(multifactor ANOV A: p=0.96), soft tissue glycogen content (multi factor ANOV A: 
p=0.21), mortality (multifactor ANOVA: p=0.S4), feed consumption (multifactor 
ANOVA: p=0.66), FCR (multifactor ANOVA: p=O.OS) and PER (multifactor ANOVA: 
p=0.06). 
Shell length gain and SGR were significantly lower for both size classes fed the 16 % 
lipid diets compared to those fed the 4 % lipid diets. However, the increase in dietary 
lipid content had a greater negative effect on the shell length gain (multi factor ANOV A: 
F(l,24)=6.66; p=0.02) and SGR (multifactor ANOVA: F(l,24)=19.02; p=0.0002) of the 30 
mm abalone compared to the 60 mm abalone (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). High levels of dietary 
57 lipid had a negative effect on the shell length gain of abalone fed both the 34 and 39 % 
protein diets, however, this negative effect was more prominent for abalone fed the 39 % 
protein diet compared to those fed the 34 % protein diet (multifactor ANaVA: 
F(1,24)=9.52; p=0.005; Figure 4.3). SGR was unaffected by dietary protein content for 
both the 30 and 60 mm abalone (Students I-test: 1(1,14)=-0.93; p=0.37 and Students I-test: 
1(1,14)=0.38; p=0.71 respectively; Table 4.7), and this response was similar for both size 
classes (multifactor ANaVA: F(1,24)=4.34; p=0.05).

Increases in dietary protein and lipid produced similar trends in the final condition factor 
of both size classes (multifactor ANaVA: p>0.05). Both the 30 mm (Students I-test: 
1(1,14)=3.39; p=0.004) and 60 mm abalone (Students I-test: 1(1,14)=4.06; p=O.OOI) fed the 4 
% lipid diets (0.85±0.01 and 1.02±0.01 respectively) had significant ly higher final 
condition factors compared to those fed the 16 % lipid diets (0.82±0.01 and 0.98±0.01 
respectively) . Dietary protein content had no effect on the final condition factor of the 30 
mm (Students I-test: 1(1,14)=0.11; p=0.92) or 60 mm abalone (Students I-test: 1(1,14)=0.17; 
p=0.87; Table 4.7). Increases in dietary lipid content from 4 to 16 % had a greater 
negative effect on the soft tissue glycogen content of the 60 mm abalone compared to the 
30 mm abalone (multi factor ANaVA: F(1,24)=8.56; p=0.007) (Figure 4.4). Dietary protein 
content had no effect on the soft tissue glycogen content of the 30 mm (Students I-test: 
1(1,14)=\.31; p=0.21) or 60 mm abalone (Students I-test: 1(1,14)=1.42; p=0.18) (Table 4.7). 
58 Trends in the mortality rates of the two size classes were similar (multi factor ANOV A: 
p>0.05). There were no difference s in mortality between the two size classes fed the diets 
containing either 4 or 16 % lipid with values ofO.7±0.62 and 0.00 % respectiv ely for the 
30 mm abalone (Mann-Whitney U=24.00, p=0.84, d.f=l) and 1.0±0.51 and 0.7±0.69 % 
respectively for the 60 mm abalone (Mann-Whitney U=25.50, p=0.68, d.f=I). Mortality of 
the 30 mm (Mann-Whitney U=31.50, p=0.96, d.f=l) and 60 mm abalone (Mann-Whitney 
U=23.50, p=0.37, d.f=l) was also independent of dietary protein content (Table 4.7).

ANOVA: F(I,24)=19.02; p=0.0002). 
Feed consumption rates were significantly higber for both size classes of abalone fed the 
16 % lipid diets. However , the 30 mm abalone consumed significantly more food when 
dietary lipid was increased from 4 to 16 % compared to the 60 mrn abalone (multifactor 
ANOVA FCI,24)=7.77; p=O.OI) (Figure 4.5). Increases in dietary lipid and protein 
produced similar FeR trends for both size classes (multifactor ANOVA: p>0.05). 
However, FeR's were significantly higher for both the 30 mm (Mann-Whitney U=O.OO, 
p=O.OOI, d~l) and 60 mm abalone (Mann-Whitney U=1.00, p=0.002, d~l) fed the 16 % 
lipid diets (2.06±0.10 and 3.41±0.53 respectively) compared to those fed the 4 % lipid 
diets (0.92±0.02 and 1.43±0.10 respectively). Feed consumption rates and FeR's were 
independent of dietary protein content for both the 30 mm (Students I-test: 1(1,14)=0.49; 
p=0.63 and Mann-Whitney U=32.00, p=l.OO, d~l respective ly) and 60 mm abalone 
(Students t-test: t(l,14)=0.68; p=0.51 and Mann-Whitney U=24.00, p=0.64, d~l 
respectively) (Table 4.7). PER decreased significantly for both size classes when dietary 
lipid was increased from 4 to 16 %. However, the increase in dietary lipid content had a 
greater negative effect on the PER of the 30 mm abalone (multifactor ANOV A: 
61 F(l,24)=5.39; p=0.03) (Figure 4.6). In addition, the 30 mm abalone utilised dietary protein 
more efficiently than the 60 mm abalone. The PER was not affected by dietary protein 
content for both the 30 rnm (Mann-Whitney U=26.00, p=0.53, dp I) and 60 mm abalone 
(Mann-Whitney U=26.00, p=0.S3, dpl) (Table 4.7).

62 4.3.3 Experiment 3: Dietary protein can be reduced if the energy content of the diet is 
maintained 
The two size classes of abalone had similar responses to an increase in dietary protein 
content reflected in their shell length gain (multifactor ANOV A: p=O.13), SGR 
(multi factor ANOVA: p=0.14), final condition factor (multifactor ANOVA: p=O.SO), 
mortality (multifactor ANOV A: p=0.6S), feed consumption (multifactor ANOV A: 
p=0.81), FeR (multifactor ANOVA: p=0.06) and PER (multifactor ANOVA: p=0.06). 
Dietary protein content did not affect the shell length gain, SGR or final condition factor 
of the two size classes (Students I-test: p>O.OS) (Table 4.8). However , the soft tissue 
glycogen content of the 30 mm abalone decreased significantly with an increase in 
dietary protein content from 20 to 34 % (multifactor ANOVA: F(I,12)=S.71; p=0.03; 
Figure 4.7). Dietary protein content had no effect on the mortality of the 30 mm (Mann­
Whitney U=2.00, p=0.08, df=l) or 60 mm abalone (Mann-Whitney U=7.00, p=O.77, 
df=l) (Table 4.8). 
The feed consumption rates of the 30 mm abalone were independent of dietary protein 
content (Students I-test: 1(1,6)=0.37; p=0.73), while the 60 mm abalone fed the 34 % diet 
(0.30±0.01 % bd.wt.d,l) consumed significantly more compared to those fed the 20 % 
protein diet (0.26±O.01 % bd.wt.d,l) (Students I-test: 1(I,W2.52; p=O.OS) (Table 4.8). The 
30 mm abalone fed the 20 % protein diet (2.SS±O.08) had significantly higher FeR's 
compared to those fed the 34 % protein diet (2.10±O.OS) (Students I-test: 1(1,6)=-4.77; 
p=0.003), while dietary protein content had no effect on the FeR's of the 60 nun abalone 
(Students I-test: 1(1,6)=1.17; p=0.28) (Table 4.8). PER decreased significantly with an 
increase in dietary protein for both the 30 mm (Students I-test: t(l,6)=-6.10; p=O.OO I) and 
60 mm abalone (Students I-test: 1(I,W-3.79; p=0.009) (Table 4.8).

4.4 Discussion 
The decline in abalone growth in response to the increasing levels of dietary lipid 
supported the findings of a number of other lipid based abalone nutritional studies on 
species including H tuberculala and H discus hannai (Mai et aI., 1995b), H midae 
(Britz and Hecht, 1997), H folgens (Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2003), H asinina (Thongrod 
et aI., 2003) and H carrugala (Montano-Vargas et aI., 2005), Interestingly, the increasing 
levels of dietary protein did not mitigate the negative effects of high dietary lipid levels 
on growth. Abalone growth rates generally increase in response to increasing levels of 
dietary protein (Mai et aI., 1995a; Britz, 1996a; Coote et aI., 2000; Gomez-Montes et aI., 
2003; Sales et aI., 2003; Montano-Vargas et aI., 2005), The limited ability of abalone to 
digest high levels of dietary lipids has been attributed to the low levels of lipases present 
in the digestive gland (Britz et aI., 1996; Knauer et aI., 1996; Garcia-Esquivel and 
Felbeck, 2006) which in tum is believed to be linked to the low lipid content of natural 
algal diets and because abalone store energy as glycogen (Webber , 1970; Mercer et aI., 
1993), 
65 Feed consumption and FCR increased significantly with an increase in dietary lipid 
content for both size classes. Feed consumption in abalone is believed to be linked to 
their requirement for energy (Bautista-Teruel and Millamena, 1999; Gomez-Montes et 
aI., 2003). Therefore, feed consumption and FCR should decrease as the energy content 
of the diet increases . However, the increase in feed consumption and FCR in response to 
increasing levels of lipid is evidence that the energetic requirements of the abalone were 
not being met by the increasing levels of dietary lipid. Thus, abalone fed the high lipid 
diets were probably consuming more food in order to satisfy their energetic requirements 
from non-lipid sources of energy i.e. the protein and carbohydrate portion of the diets. In 
addition, Van Barneveld et al. (1998) found that a dietary oil inclusion level of three 
percent reduced gross energy digestion in juvenile H. laevigata and levels of six percent 
reduced the digestion of dietary nitrogen and amino acids. Thus, the increasing levels of 
dietary lipid may have reduced the uptake of other nutrients in the diet. 
The inhibiting effect of lipids on the uptake of other dietary nutrients may explain the 
observed decrease in condition factor and soft tissue glycogen content in response to the 
increasing levels of dietary lipid, signifying that less energy was available for storage as 
glycogen. Mai et al. (\ 995a) showed that soft tissue protein content was negatively 
correlated to increasing levels of dietary lipid in H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai. 
The results demonstrate that the abalone were unable to utilise increasing levels of 
dietary lipid as a source of energy, and it is likely that the abalone were satisfying their 
energetic requirements from dietary proteins and carbohydrates. Protein and 
carbohydrates have been identified as the principal energy sources in abalone nutrition 
(Carefoot et aI., 1993; Knauer et aI., 1996; Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2004; Montano-Vargas 
et aI., 2005; Viana et aI., 2007). Durazo-Beltran et al. (2004) investigated the effects of 
starvation on H. folgens for 60 days. As expected the abalone were observed to lose body 
weight during the starvation period. However, soft tissue lipid concentrations increased 
during the starvation period and thus the weight loss was associated with the use of 
bodily protein and carbohydrate stores as energy sources (Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2004). 
66 The inability of abalone to utilise dietary lipids as a source of energy was linked to a 
condition that occurs in certain muscle types (Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2003). For example, 
rat heart and chondrichthian muscles lack the ability to utilise free fatty acids as an 
energy source and thus anaerobic metabolism making use of carbohydrates and ketonic 
bodies serves as an energy source (Moyes and West, 1995 cited by (Durazo-Beltran et aI., 
2003). However, free fatty acids inhibit the use of carbohydrates and thus cut off the 
energy pathway (Moyes and West, 1995 cited by (Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2003), and it is 
possible that a similar mechanism may occur in abalone tissue (Durazo-Beltran et aI., 
2003). The inability of abalone to utilise dietary lipids as a source of energy has also been 
ascribed to their low metabolic rate (Thongrod et aI., 2003). 
The growth rates of the 60 mm abalone (i.e. mean shell length gain of I mm.month-I) fell 
below the average growth rates required by commercial farming operations (2-3 
mm.month-I) (Fleming et aI., 1996). However, when dissected the abalone were observed 
to be sexually mature. This may explain the below average growth rates as it is possible 
that the abalone were investing energy into gonad maturation rather than growth. 
Reductions in growth in response to the onset of sexual maturity is well documented in 
abalone and has been ascribed to energy being channelled into gonad development rather 
than growth (Shepherd and Hearn, 1983; Mercer et aI., 1993; Capinpin and Corre, 1996). 
It is possible that the high lipid diets stimulated the development of the gonads leading to 
the subsequent reduction in growth rates. Mercer et al. (1993) found algal diets with high 
levels of lipid stimulated the development of gonads and resulted in a reduction in 
growth, while abalone fed diets with low lipid contents had no such reduction. Although 
abalone have limited ability to utilise lipids as a energy source they are able to store high 
levels of lipid in their body tissues (Webber, 1970; Mercer et a!., 1993; Mai et a!., 1995b; 
Dunstan et aI., 1996; Britz and Hecht, 1997; Nelson et a!., 2002; Gomez-Montes et aI., 
2003; Thongrod et a!., 2003; Durazo-Beltran et a!., 2004). The storage of lipids in 
abalone tissues is unlikely to be linked to energy storage but rather as a source of lipid for 
gonad maturation and larval development as there is evidence to suggest that lipids pass 
from the hepatopancreas to the gonads (Nelson et a!., 2002). Further studies are required 
to investigate the effects of dietary lipid levels on gonad development. 
67 It was possible to reduce dietary protein content of the diet from 34 to 20 % without 
negatively affecting the growth of the two size classes. Reductions in the protein portion 
of formulated feeds tlnough the provision of sufficient levels of dietary energy have been 
demonstrated in a number of species including: H. asinina (Bautista- Teruel and 
Millamena, 1999), H. laevigata (Coote et aI., 2000) and H. midae (Sales et aI., 2003; 
Jones and Britz, 2006; Chapter 2). Bautista-Teruel and Millamena (1999) reduced the 
protein content of a formulated feed for H. asinina from 32 to 27 % by increasing the 
energy content of the diet from 12.94 to 13.19 Mlkg'l. However, there is a large amount 
of evidence, including the present results, to suggest that energy should be provided by 
carbohydrates not lipids (Mai et aI., 1995b; Britz et aI., 1996; Knauer et aI., 1996; Britz 
and Hecht, 1997; Van Barneveld et aI., 1998; Bautista-Teruel and Millamena, 1999; 
Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2003; Thongrod et aI., 2003; Durazo-Beltran et a!., 2004; Montano­
Vargas et aI., 2005; Viana et aI., 2007; Chapter 2). 
The significant reduction in growth of the 30 mm abalone in response to increasing levels 
of dietary lipid mirrored the findings of Britz and Hecht (1997). However, Britz and 
Hecht (1997) suggested that young adult abalone (40 mm) have a higher dietary protein 
requirement (i.e. 44 %) than juvenile abalone (10 mm) (i.e. 34 %). There present study 
provided no evidence to suggest that the two size classes had different dietary protein 
requirements. However, the 30 mm abalone had higher PER's compared to the 60 mm 
abalone, which suggests that the 30 mm abalone made more efficient use of dietary 
protein compared to the 60 mm abalone. This may be linked to a higher degree of 
digestive plasticity in juvenile abalone compared to older abalone (Shipton and Britz, 
200 I b). The channelling of energy into gonad development in the 60 mm abalone may 
have resulted in the poorer PER values. 
4.5 Conclusion 
High levels of dietary lipid negatively affected the growth, condition factor and soft 
tissue glycogen content of both size classes of abalone. This negative effect was greater 
in the 30 mm size class compared to the 60 mm abalone. The corresponding increase in 
feed consumption and FCR in response to increasing levels of dietary protein also 
68 provides evidence that abalone are unable to utilise dietary lipids as an energy source and 
high levels of dietary lipid probably inhibit the uptake of carbohydrates and protein. High 
dietary lipid levels did however appear to promote gonad maturation. It was possible to 
reduce dietary protein from 34 to 20 % without negatively affecting growth through the 
maintenance of dietary energy levels and thus it is recommended that manipulations in 
the energy content of formulated feeds should be approached through the use of 
carbohydrates.

Concluding Discussion 
It was possible to reduce the protein portion of formulated feeds for Haliotis midae 
through the provision of sufficient levels of dietary energy supplied from carbohydrates. 
This result is consistent with the findings of previous studies (Coote et aI., 2000; 
Bautista-Ternel et aI., 2003; Sales et aI., 2003; Jones and Britz, 2006) but is based on a 
larger, more quantitative dataset covering a range of temperatures, abalone sizes, protein 
levels and energy levels. In summary, the results demonstrated that it was possible to 
reduce dietary protein from 26 to 18 % provided dietary energy was maintained at 13.5 
MJ.kg'l or more. In addition to the reduction in dietary protein it was possible to reduce 
dietary energy from 16.2 to 13.5 MJ.kg,1 which is suggested to be an "optimal" energy 
level for formulated feeds for H. midae (Chapter 2). These results support the notion of 
(Fleming et aI., 1996) that dietary energy levels are often over-specified in formulated 
abalone feeds. The result is useful to feed manufacturers and abalone farmers as there are 
potential economic savings associated with reductions in the protein and/or carbohydrate 
portions of formulated feeds. Further investigations into the manipulation of dietary 
carbohydrate levels may also allow for further reductions in the protein portion of 
fom1Ulated feeds for H. midae. 
A number of abalone nutritional studies have investigated the protein and energy 
requirements of abalone in order to determine optimal dietary protein to energy ratios 
(Britz and Hecht, 1997; Bautista- Ternel and Millamena, 1999; Gomez-Montes et aI., 
2003; Montano-Vargas et aI., 2005), Protein to energy ratios (P:E) were a poor predictor 
of diet performance in this study. For example, in Chapter 2 abalone fed diet treatments 
with P:E ratios ranging from 1.36 to 1.86 (Diets I, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8; 2: 13.2 MJ.kg,1 
energy) grew at similar rates, whereas diets with similar P:E ratios (Diets 6 and 9; < 13.2 
MJ.kg'l energy) displayed poor growth (Table 5.1). Thus, provision of sufficient levels of 
dietary energy is probably a more important consideration in abalone feed formulations, 
as opposed to maintaining a fixed dietary protein to energy ratio, 
70 Table 5.1: The nine experimental diets used in Chapter 2 and formulated to contain 
graded levels of protein and energy to produce five protein:energy (P:E) ratios. The 
values shown are the values obtained from the original dietary formulations.

The protein sparing effect observed in the trials described in Chapters 2 and 4 were not 
evident in the feeding trials described in Chapter 3, where the growth rates of the abalone 
were well below the expected commercial growth rate, despite all diets having energy 
levels of approximately IS MJ.kg"1 energy. The suppressed growth rates were probably 
due to a non-nutritional factor. The trends observed between the dietary treatments thus 
need to be interpreted with caution, and cannot be regarded as representative of farmed 
abalone growing at maximal rates. 
There is limited information on the mInImum nutritional requirements of abalone. 
Abalone growth and survival were significantly compromised when dietary energy levels 
were reduced to I \.6 Mlkg-I regardless of the protein content of the diet (18 -26 %) 
(Chapter 2). It seems that the diet has to contain a minimum amount of dietary energy 
supplied from carbohydrate and protein in order for the abalone to efficiently utilise the 
protein portion of the diet, as even abalone fed the 26 % protein 11.6 MJ.kg-1 energy diet 
had poor growth and survival. This finding may have important implications for farmers 
making use of natural algal diets as a feed source, since seasonal fluctuations in the 
nutritional contents of a number of seaweed species have been reported (Mercer et aI., 
1993). Seasonal variations in the carbon content of the local kelp Ecklonia maxima have 
also been detected (Smith, 2008) and thus it is possible that kelp contains insufficient 
levels of carbohydrates during certain periods of the year. It may be beneficial for 
farmers making use of kelp as a feed source to supplement the abalone diet with 
formulated feeds during these periods. Abalone eat to satisfy their energetic requirements 
(Bautista-Teruel and Millamena, 1999; Gomez-Montes et aI., 2003; Chapters 2, 3 and 4). 
71 This principle is a useful tool for formulating diets for H. midae as it allows formulators 
to ensure that the diet contains sufficient energy but also that the diet does not contain 
excessive energy that may result in the abalone's energetic requirements being met before 
the requirements for other nutrients are satisfied (Fleming et aI., 1996). 
The growth, survival and feed conversion efficiency were highest for abalone cultured at 
18 ·C (Chapters 2 and 3) but were significantly reduced at water temperatures of 22 and 
24°C (Chapter 2) which is consistent with the results of Britz et al. (1997). Thus, once 
abalone receive an optimal dietary formulation and are stocked under optimal conditions 
with favourable water quality, any further improvements in growth will be reliant on 
maintaining optimal temperatures in the culture environment. The bulk of abalone 
farming operations in South Africa are land-based making use of pump ashore single pass 
technology and thus have very little control over culture environment water temperatures 
(Cook, 1998; Troell et aI., 2006). Famers could potentially explore the use of 
recirculating aquaculture systems or heating incoming water, as abalone cultured under 
optimal temperature conditions in the experiment described in Chapter 2 achieved growth 
rates of2 - 3 mm.month-l. 
The nutritional requirements of H. midae were unaffected by water temperature in the 
ranges tested in this study. This has promising implications for feed management regimes 
as farmers need not adjust dietary formulations in response to changing water 
temperatures. The feeds developed in Chapter 2 will not only allow farmers to safely feed 
their stock during periods of elevated water temperatures but also potentially allow the 
abalone culture industry to expand into the warmer Eastern Cape region of South Africa, 
which has been identified as the most suitable area for expansion of the industry (Hecht, 
1994; Britz et aI., 1997). 
Carbohydrates and protein serve as the primary sources of energy in abalone nutrition 
(Carefoot et aI., 1993; Knauer et aI., 1996; Durazo-Beltran et aI., 2004; Montano-Vargas 
et aI., 2005; Viana et aI., 2007; Chapters 2, 3 and 4), and the results from Chapter 4 
confirm that lipids probably play a minimal role as an energy source. However, the 
72 inclusion of lipids is vital for the provision of essential fatty acids and other precursors 
required for growth and gonad maturation (Mai et at, 1995; Nelson et aI., 2002). It is 
likely that the dietary lipid requirements of abalone are being met by the lipid content of 
the dietary ingredients supplied in formulated feeds (Fleming et aI., 1996). 
There was no empirical evidence in the present experiments to support the hypothesis 
that abalone of different sizes have differing dietary protein and energy requirements 
(Britz and Hecht, 1997; Shipton and Britz, 200Ib), although smaller abalone appeared to 
have a lower tolerance to high levels of dietary lipid (Chapter 4). The tolerance of the 
larger abalone to high levels of dietary lipid may be linked to the sexual maturity of 
larger animals and the channelling of lipids into gonad maturation (Chapter 4). 
Nonetheless, further studies are required to address the nutritional requirements of 
abalone of different sizes. 
To conclude, reductions in the protein portion of formulated feeds for H. midae are 
possible provided the diet contains sufficient levels of energy supplied from 
carbohydrates . A "high temperature maintenance" diet based on the current research is 
now commercially available to farms exposed to periods of elevated water temperatures. 
As the ability of abalone to utilise dietary lipid is limited, lipids are unlikely to playa 
significant role as an energy source in abalone feeds. Further investigations should focus 
on the utilisation of various carbohydrate sources in abalone feeds.
