Introduction
Dyeing textiles has been practiced for thousands of years 
with the first record of the use of dyestuf f dated at 2600 B.C in 
China. Among various industries, the textile industry utilises a 
multitude of chemical products containing organic surfactants, 
dispersants, alkalis, solvents, humectants, acids, salts and 
residual dyes (Tchobanoglous and Burton, 1995) thus, releasing 
a significant amount of wastewater from its various processing 
operations. The dyeing processes are an integral part of the 
textile industry , with consumption of large amount of fresh water 
and release of equally large volume of coloured effluent. Majority 
of the dyes employed in textile industries are synthetic, and of 
these approximately 60–70% are azo dyes. Azo dyes are 
aromatic moieties linked together by azo (–N=N–) bond and 
represent the largest class of dyes used in textile industries 
(Stolz, 2001). Dyes are detected in water at concentrations as low -1
as 1 mg l (Ramalho et al., 2004). Nearly 15–20% of these azo 
dyes fail to adhere to the fabric and are released into the sewage 
treatment systems or into the environment (Lewis, 1999; Reisch, 
1996), causing aesthetic problems severely affecting the 
photosynthetic function due to low light penetration. Color is the 
first contaminant to be recognized in wastewater and has to be removed before discharging into water bodies. A number of 
physico-chemical methods (coagulation, adsorption, membrane 
filtration and ion exchange) are available for decolorization and 
detoxification of textile dyeing wastewaters (Churchley , 1994).  
However , almost all of these treatment methods have serious 
drawbacks such as high cost, huge chemical sludge production 
and does not remove all dyes (Krull et al., 1998; Sen and Demirer , 
2003). For these reasons, biological methods of wastewater 
treatment are considered as the best alternative as they are 
environmental friendly and can lead to complete mineralization of 
organic pollutants at low cost. Azo dyes are generally considered 
xenobiotic compounds that are recalcitrant to degradation 
because of their synthetic origin and complex aromatic molecular 
structures (Banat et al., 1996). Several microorganisms (bacteria, 
fungi, algae and yeast) have been reported to possess the ability 
to decolorize and mineralize different kinds of azo dyes under 
various environmental conditions (Pandey et al., 2007; Maximo et 
al., 2003). Among these microorganisms, bacteria are most 
commonly used for various bioremediation processes. Extensive 
studies have been carried out to determine the potential of 
diverse bacteria in decolorizing various structurally different azo 
dyes (Yu et al., 2001; Chang et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2003; Hong 
et al., 2008). The initial step in bacterial degradation of azo dyes,  Aerobic biodegradation of azo dye Acid Black-24

Abstract
Key wordsBacillus halodurans  MTCC 865 was employed for decolorization of textile azo dye, Acid Black-24 (AB-24). -1
Thousand mglof AB-24 was decolorized with 90% efficiency by the strain within 6 hrs at pH 9 and 37°C with 
5% NaCl under static conditions in screening medium. Decolorization was evaluated by measuring the 
periodic decrease in absorbance at 557nm (λ). Biodegradation of Acid Black-24 was determined by FTIR max
and HPLC. The FTIR spectrum of the AB-24 dye suggests the presence of azo bond (–N=N–) peak at –1
1618.28 cm. Absence of the azo bond in the degraded sample spectrum indicates biodegradation of the 
dye. Formation of metabolites with different retention times in HPLC analysis further confirmed degradation 
of the azo dye, Acid Black-24 by Bacillus halodurans .

Journal of Environmental Biology , May 2014in either anaerobic or aerobic conditions, is the breakdown of 
–N=N– bond. Anaerobic azo dye reduction has been thoroughly 
investigated and found to be favourable but with generation of 
aromatic amines which are toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic in 
nature and reoxidize in certain environmental conditions 
(Pinheiro et al., 2004; Myslak and Bolt, 1998). Bacteria are 
seldom able to decolorize azo compounds in the presence of 
oxygen , as a result very few reports exists on the aerobic 
decolorization of azo dyes (Coughlin et al., 2002; Chang et al., 
2001; Buitron et al., 2004; Sarayu and Sandhya, 2010). Since, 
dyeing effluents are characterized by high levels of alkalinity and 
salinity , application of microorganisms able to sustain stringent 
conditions of effluent is indispensable for biodegradation.  The 
aim of the present work was to evaluate the potential of Bacillus 
halodurans  MTCC 865 to decolorize azo dye, Acid Black 24 (AB-
24) aerobically  at different pH,   temperature and salinity using 
UV-Vis spectrophotometer, Fourier Transform Infrared 
Spectroscopy (FTIR) and High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC).  
Materials and Methods
Azo dye, Acid Black-24 (AB-24) with maximum 
absorbance at 557 nm (λ), was a generous gift from a local max
textile mill in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. HPLC-grade 
methanol was purchased from Sigma. Stock solution of azo dye -1
was prepared by dissolving 5 gl dye in distilled water and filtered 
through 0.45µm membrane filter. Bacillus halodurans  MTCC 865 
was procured from Institute of Microbial Technology , Chandigarh, 
India. The pure strain was routinely maintained at 4°C on Alkaline -1 
Bacillus Medium with the following composition. 10gl Peptone, 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 
glYeast Extract, 10 glGlucose, 4 glKHPO , 15 glAgar and pH 2 4
9. Dye decolorization studies were carried out in screening-1 -1 -1 
medium consisting of 10 gl Peptone, 10 glMeat Extract, 5 gl
NaCl and pH 9 under static conditions. Decolorization was 
spectro photometrically assayed by UV-visible spectro-
photometer (UV- 2401 PC Shimadzu), biodegradation was 
analysed by FTIR (Thermo Nicolet AVATAR 330) and HPLC 
(Waters, Model No.501).
Decolorization experiment : A loopfull of B. halodurans  was 
inoculated in Luria Bertani broth and precultured at 30°C with 
shaking at 130 rpm  overnight (Sambrook et al., 1999) until 9 -1
absorbance at 600nm reached 1.0 (about 10 cell ml). An 10%  
inoculum (v/v) of pre-grown cells of B. halodurans  were used to 
inoculate 100ml of screening medium in 250ml Erlenmeyer flasks -1
amended with 1000 mgl of Acid Black-24 dye. The experimental 
set up was incubated at pH 9 and 37°C under static conditions for 
the process of decolorization. Aliquot (3ml) of sample was 
withdrawn at regular intervals (0, 2, 4 and 6hr) and centrifuged at 
8,000 × g for 15 min to remove suspended biomass. The 
supernatant obtained was analysed for decolorization by 
measuring the absorbance at 557 nm (λ). Uninoculated max
medium was always included as control. The reduction  
 percentage in dye concentration was calculated from the 
following equation: 
Reduction percentage    =     C-Ci r 
 C×100%i
where C and C were initial and residual dye concentrations, i r
respectively . All assays were carried out in triplicate.
Effect of physico-chemical parameters on decolorization :  
Decolorization of AB-24 by B. halodurans  was assessed under 
various physico-chemical conditions. The effect of different 
temperatures (32, 37, 40, 45, 50 and 55°C) at pH 9, various pH (6, 
7, 8, 9 and 10) at 37°C and salinity levels (2, 5, 7, 10 and 12% 
NaCl) at pH 9 and 37°C  on dye decolorization was analysed in 
screening medium under static conditions.
Biodegradation analysis : Biodegradation of Acid Black-24 by 
B. halodurans  was analysed by FTIR and HPLC. For this, 100ml 
of culture broth was taken at 0hr and 6hr (before and after 
decolorization), centrifuged at 10,000g for 15min and the 
degraded metabolites were extracted from supernatant using 
equal volumes of ethyl acetate. The extracts were dried over 
anhydrous NaSO and evaporated to dryness in rotary 2 4
evaporator . The metabolites were characterized by FTIR in the -1
mid IR region of 400–4000 cm with 16 scan speed. The samples 
were mixed with spectroscopically pure KBr in 7 : 93 ratio, pellets 
were fixed in sample holder , and the analysis was carried out.  For 
HPLC analysis, the evaporated metabolites were dissolved in 
small volume of HPLC grade methanol and run on C column 18
-1
(symmetry , 4.6×250mm) with a flow rate of 1ml min and UV 
detector set at 557 nm. The mobile phase was methanol/water 
(50:50, v/v).
Statistical analysis : For analysis of data, one-way analysis of 
variance (ANOV A) with Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test 
was used. Readings were considered significant when P  was ≤
0.05.
Results and Discussion
Decolorization of Acid Black-24 by B. halodurans  MTCC 
865 was achieved within a short time of 6 hrs under static aerobic 
conditions. Decolorization was monitored spectrophotometrically 
at 557 nm (λ of AB-24). The major dye peak at 0hr was reduced max
significantly by the end of 6hr (Fig. 1). Ninety percent of AB-24 -1
(1000 mgl) was decolorized within 6 hrs at pH 9 and 37°C under 
static conditions in screening medium. Disappearance of major 
dye peak at 557 nm with time, confirmed decolorization of AB-24. 
Environmental factors are known to play a crucial role 
affecting the decolorization activity of microorganisms (Pearcea 
et al., 2003). The result of the effect of pH on AB-24 decolorization 
by B. halodurans  is shown in Fig. 2a. B. halodurans  decolorized -1
AB-24 (1000 mg l) over a wide range of pH (6–10). The strain  550 A.S.A. Prasad and K.V .B. RaoOnline Copy
Journal of Environmental Biology , May 2014exhibited optimal growth at pH 7, 8 and 9 (data not shown), with 
maximum decolorization rate of about 90% at pH 9 within 6 hrs in 
screening medium under static conditions. Decolorization rates of 
about 44, 58 and 50% were observed at pH 7, 8 and 10, 
respectively . Least decolorization rate of 15% was seen at pH 6 
and the strain failed to grow at pH 5. Fig. 2b shows the result 
temperature effect on AB-24 decolorization.  The optimal 
temperature for AB-24 decolorization by B. halodurans  was 37°C. 
Decolorization rate gradually decreased with increase in 
temperature ranging from 40–50°C. This could be due to loss in 
cell metabolism and viability , which was also observed with 
decolorization of azo dyes by Shewanella putrefaciens  strain 
AS96 (Khalid et al., 2008). Percent decolorization rates of about 
71, 52 and 33% were noticed at 40°C, 45°C and 50°C, 
respectively . Lowest rate of decolorization (8%) was observed at 
55°C. Apart from high temperature and alkaline conditions, high 
level of salts were found in the industrial effluents containing azo 
dyes (Aksu, 2003). Hence, the potential of B. halodurans  to 
decolorize azo dye AB-24 at various concentrations of salt was 
assessed and the results are shown in Fig. 2c. AB-24 was 
reduced by 50% with 2% NaCl. At 5% salt, B. halodurans  reduced -1
90% of AB-24 (1000 mgl) in 6 hrs under static conditions. Further , 
increase in NaCl concentration resulted in significant decrease in 
decolorization rate. Decreasing decolorization rates by 77, 44 and 
10% was observed at 7, 10 and 12% NaCl concentration, 
respectively . High salt concentrations cause inhibitory effects in 
microorganisms leading to reduction in biological activity (Kargi, 
2002). Slightly similar results were obtained with AR-27 dye 
decolorization by Shewanella aquimarina  with 5% NaCl exhibiting 
98% dye reduction under static anaerobic conditions (Meng et al., 
2012). The strain exhibited negligible growth in the absence of 
NaCl and did not grow above 12% salt concentration.  551 Biodegradation of Acid Black-24 by Bacillus halodurans MTCC 865

Comparison of FTIR of control dye (Fig. 3a) with extracted 
metabolites (Fig. 3b) revealed significant changes in the 
spectrum. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of control dye represented 
–N=N– stretching and C–C stretching frequencies of azo groups –1
and aromatic rings at 1618.28 cm and 1570.06, 1508.33, –1 –1
1452.40 cm , respectively . Whereas peaks at 1330.88 cm  and –1 
1280.73 cm indicated C–N stretching frequencies of aromatic 
carbons attached with nitrogen functionality . The peaks at –1 –1 
1124.50 cm, 642.30 and 615.29 cm represented  S=O 
stretching frequency of SONa group on aromatic ring. After 3
decolorization of dye, the FTIR spectrum of extracted metabolites 
showed considerable change in the positions of peaks as –1
compared to spectrum of control dye. A peak at 3394.72 cm 
represented N–H stretching of amino group in the extracted metabolites FTIR spectrum, whereas two newly formed peaks at –1 –1
1529.55 cm and 1452.40 cm represented C=C stretching –1 
frequencies of aromatic ring. The peaks at 3082.25 cm and –1
1635.64 cm indicated C–H stretching of aromatic ring and 
–N=N– stretching of azo group, respectively . Similarly , peaks at –1 –1 –1
1124.50 cm, 621.08, 538.14, 516.92 cm and 1332.81 cm, –1 
1242.16 cm represented S=O stretching frequencies of SONa 3
and C–N stretching frequencies of aromatic carbon attached with –1 
nitrogen in the extracted metabolites. The peaks at 950.91 cm–1
and 700.16 cm were indicative of C–H deformation of aromatic –1
ring protons. Appearance of a peak at 3394.72 cm, which 
represented formation of –NH  group in the FTIR spectrum of 2
extracted metabolites after decolorization of dye led to 
confirmation for degradation of Acid Black- 24. HPLC analysis A.S.A. Prasad and K.V .B. Rao

Journal of Environmental Biology , May 2014report of dye sample withdrawn at beginning of static incubation 
(0 hrs) is shown in Fig. 4. A single peak of  Acid Black-24 appeared 
at a retention time of 2.81 min. After a period of 6 hrs, as the 
degradation proceeded, HPLC chromatogram of degraded 
sample (Fig. 5) showed the presence of two major new peaks at 
2.45 and 2.68 min, respectively and two minor peaks at 3.50 and 
6.50 min. Absence of major dye peak and appearance of multiple 
peaks at different retention times is indicative of biodegradation of 
Acid Black-24. Similar degradation results with respect to UV-Vis, 
FTIR and HPLC were noticed in previous studies with Aeromonas 
hydrophila  (Chen et al., 2003) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  
(Sarayu and Sandhya, 2010).
In conclusion, Acid Black-24 was efficiently decolorized 
and degraded by Bacillus halodurans  under alkaline conditions 
within a short time of 6 hrs. The results indicate that Bacillus 
halodurans  could be used as an effective strain in degrading 
various textile dyes and in the treatment of alkaline dyeing 
effluents.
