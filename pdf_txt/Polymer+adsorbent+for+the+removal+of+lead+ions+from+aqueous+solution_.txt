Abstract 
Heavy metals like lead, mercury, zinc, copper, nickel etc. pres ent in waste water and industrial effluent 
is major concern of environmental pollution. Lead is highly tox ic to human’s body systems causing 
mental deficiency, brain damage, anemia as well as behavioural problems. According to Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) the permissible level of lead (II) in d rinking water is 0.05 mg/L-1. 
Contamination of water by toxic metal is a worldwide problem. A dsorption is an effective purification 
and separation technique used in industry especially in water a nd waste water treatments. Many 
methods and materials are used in heavy metal removal from wate r. These methods have several 
disadvantages and advantages. 
 
Keywords: Lead, Aqueous solution, Low cost adsorbents, Adsorption. 
 
Introduction 
Environmental contamination by toxic metals is a serious proble m worldwide due to their 
incremental accumulation in the food chain and continued persis tence in the ecosystem. The 
heavy metals lead, mercury, copper, cadmium, zinc, nickel, chro mium is among the most 
common pollutants found in industrial effluents. Even at low co ncentrations, these metals 
can be toxic to organisms, including humans [1]. The higher concentration of lead will cause 
severe damage to the nervous system and affects the function of  brain cells [2]. For example 
Pb is highly toxic to humans; causing mental deficiency, brain damage, anemia, as well as 
behavioural problems [3] the greater Environmental awareness in both the public and 
regulatory sphere in recent years has necessitated greater trea tment of industrial effluent [4]. 
Strict environmental protection legislation and public environm ental concerns lead the search 
for novel techniques to remove heavy metals from industrial was te water [5]. The industrial 
activity is the major source of lead contamination in water [6] there are several techniques to 
remove heavy metals from waste water [7]. Lead is one of the industrial pollutants. Possibly 
enter to the ecosystem through soil, air, and water [8]. Activated carbon is one of the most 
popular adsorbents for the removal of metal ions from aqueous s olutions [9]. Adsorption is an 
effective purification and separation technique used in industr y especially in water and 
wastewater treatments [10]. Lead can cause central nervous system damage. Lead can also 
damage the kidney, liver and reproductive system [11]. In children, lead causes a decrease in 
intelligent quotient (IQ) score, retardation of physical growth , hearing impairment, impaired 
learning, as well as decreased attention and classroom performa nce [12]. The heavy metals are 
of special concern because they pose a significant danger to hu man health [13]. Dissolved and 
liberated metals in the environments [14] tend to accumulate in living bodies through the food 
chain and direct uptake [15] many naturally occurring materials have been investigated for 
assessing their suitability in controlling water pollution [16] water pollution due to heavy 
metals such as cadmium and lead are serious global problems [17] many methods have been 
developed to address these stringent environmental regulation w hich necessitate removal of 
heavy metal compounds from wastewater [18]. The permissible level of lead (II) in drinking 
water is 0.05mg/L-1 as given by the environmental protection Agency (EPA).meanwhil e the 
level of lead (II) permitted by bur eau of Indian Standards (BIS ) is 0.1 International Journal of Applied Research 2016; 2(7): 178-182

mg/L-1 [19]. Hence proper treatment of industrial wastewater 
that is releasing lead into the aquatic and land systems is ver y 
important [20]. Increasing level of heavy metals in natural 
water bodies poses a serious threat to all living species 
including humans [21]. Amongst the present day's 
environmental issues, water scarcity and water pollution rank 
equal to climate change [22] so their removals from industrial 
waste waters remain an important challenge [23] many 
techniques tried out to remove heavy metals from wastewater 
[24]. The numbers of applications of metals for commercial 
uses continue to grow with the developments in modern science and technology 
[25] various biological treatments, both 
aerobic and anaerobic can be used for heavy metal removal 
[26]. Lead is widely used in storage battery, hot-dip 
galvanizing, ceramic glazing [27] due to rapid development and 
industrialization in many countries the level of industrial 
pollution have been steadily rising [28] while Pb(II) can bio 
accumulate through the food chain [29] the Royal society of 
Canada (1986) reported that human exposure to lead has 
harmful effects [30]. Therefore a very low concentration of lead 
i n  w a t e r  i s  v e r y  t o x i c  [31] heavy metals have been used in a 
variety of ways for many centuries for the past three centuries  
the production of heavy metals such as lead, copper, and zinc has increased exponentially 
[32]. According to the United 
Nations Organization reports there are 1.1 billion people still  
do not have access to safe supply of drinking water [33]. Lead 
has a high degree of accumulation upon continued exposure 
and a slow rate of removal when exposure ceases [34] w a s t e  
water is a very complex mixture of different species with a variety of different physicochemical properties 
[35]. 
 
Health Impact of Lead Exposure 
Impact of lead exposure in humans has been known to cause 
wide variety of health problems such as  
 Various forms of blood disorders and Anemia. 
 Rapid deterioration of brain and the nervous system. 
 Reduced fertility both in men women  
 Failure of the kidney and 
 Alzheimer disease 
In 2000, the allowable level of lead in drinking water was 
reduced from 0.6 ppm to 0.05 ppm. However, no level of lead 
is considered to be actually safe today [36]. 
 
Advantages of Adsorption Process and Adsorbents  
Adsorption is an effective purification and separation 
technique used in industry especially in water and waste water 
treatments. A number of methods for toxic metal removal 
from waste water have been used. But most have several disadvantages such as continuous input of chemicals, high 
cost, toxic sludge generation or incomplete metal removal but 
the adsorption process has been found advantageous such as 
low cost of adsorbent, easy availability, utilization of industrial biological and domestic waste as adsorbents, low 
operational cost, ease of operation compared to other 
processes. reuse of adsorbent af ter regeneration, capacity of 
removing heavy metal ions over wide range of pH and to a 
much lower level, ability to remove complex form of metals 
that is generally not possible by other methods, 
environmentally friendly cost effective and technically feasible. Adsorption process is the best process for removal of  
metals from waste water because it is simple, time saving and 
inexpensive involving no sophisticated apparatus. A definite need exists for low cost adsorbents which exhibit superior 
adsorption capacities and local availability 
[37].  
 Various Conventional Methods of Heavy Metal Removal 
Electro dialysis 
Electro dialysis (ED) is a membrane process during which 
ions are transported through semi permeable membrane under 
the influence of an electric potential. The membranes are cat 
ion or anion selective, which basically means that either 
positive ions or negative ions will flow through. Cation selective membranes are polyelectrolytes with negatively 
charged matter, which rejects negatively charged ions and 
allows positively charged ions to flow through 
[38]. 
 
 Reverse Osmosis 
It is a process in which heavy metals are separated by a semi 
permeable membrane at a pressure greater than the osmotic 
pressure caused by the dissolved  solids in waste water. The 
disadvantage of this method is that it is expensive [39]. 
 
Chemical Precipitation  
Precipitation of metals is achieved by the addition of 
coagulants such as alum, lime iron salts and other organic 
polymers. The large amount of sludge containing toxic 
compounds produced during the process is the main disadvantage
 [39]. 
 
 Ion – exchange 
In this process metal ions from dilute solutions are exchanged 
with ions held by electrostatic forces on the exchange resin. 
The disadvantages include – high cost and partial removal of certain ions 
[39]. 
 
Ultra filtration  
They are pressure driven membrane operations that use 
porous membranes for the removal of heavy metals. The main 
disadvantage of this process is the generation of sludge [39]. 
 
 Coagulation / Flocculation 
Coagulation and Flocculation are an essential part of drinking 
water treatment as well as waste water treatment. Coagulation 
is the chemical reaction which occurs when a chemical or 
coagulant is added to the water. The coagulant encourages the colloidal material in the water to join together into small 
aggregates called “flocs”. Suspended matter is then attracted 
to these flocs. Flocculation is a slow gentle mixing of the water to encourage the flocs to form and grow to a size which will easily settle out 
[38].
