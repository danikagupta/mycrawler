In addition to its scientific importance, the degradation of azo dyes is of practical significance from 
the perspective of environmental protection. Although encouraging progress has been made on developing degradation approaches and materials, it is still challenging to fully resolve this long-
standing problem. Herein, we report that high entropy alloys, which have been emerging as a new 
class of metallic materials in the last decade, have excellent performance in degradation of azo dyes. In particular, the newly developed AlCoCrTiZn high-entropy alloy synthesized by mechanical alloying exhibits a prominent efficiency in degradation of the azo dye (Direct Blue 6: DB6), as high as that of the 
best metallic glass reported so far. The newly developed AlCoCrTiZn HEA powder has low activation 
energy barrier, i.e., 30 kJ/mol, for the degrading reaction and thus make the occurrence of reaction 
easier as compared with other materials such as the glassy Fe-based powders. The excellent capability of our high-entropy alloys in degrading azo dye is attributed to their unique atomic structure with severe lattice distortion, chemical composition effect, residual stress and high specific surface area. Our 
findings have important implications in developing novel high-entropy alloys for functional applications 
as catalyst materials.
Azo dyes, a kind of synthetic dyestuff, have wide applications in textile, printing, leather, food, and cosmetic 
industries due to their fast kinetics. The major structure of these dyes is characterized by the nitrogen to nitrogen double bonds “-N=  N-” , which is fairly stable and recalcitrant to degrading
1. As a consequence, the widespread 
applications of azo dyes are accompanied inevitably by environmental problems2–4. For example, the azo dye 
remnants in textile effluents are harmful to the aquatic ecological environment because they do prevent light penetration into water
5. Therefore, it is of importance to degrade azo dyes existing in industrial wastewater.
Over the years, considerable efforts have been devoted to degrading azo dyes effluents, and as a consequence, 
various approaches have been developed to address this issue, such as physical absorption6,7, biological degra-
dation2,3,8,9, photocatalytic degradation1,10–12 and degradation by zero-valent metals13–16. Nevertheless, most of 
them have their own limitations to some extent to fully resolve the long-standing problem. For instance, bio-logical degradation is difficult to be controlled to reach a satisfactory level, especially in some complex envi-ronment containing various chemicals
9, whilst light-degradation has limitations in transferring to commercial 
scale15. Currently, zero-valent metals have been extensively exploited in industrial applications because of their 
low cost, high degradation capability and simple operations, but their efficiency decays dramatically as a result of their rapid corrosion behavior in water, such as zero-valent-Mg
17. Although the chemical stability and activity of 
zero-valent-metals can be improved by alloying with noble metals18, their commercialization is still challenging 
because of the high cost. Recently, it was reported that metallic glasses showed excellent capability in degrading azo dyes due to their thermodynamically metastable feature of atomic structures
17,19–21. Unfortunately, synthesis 
of metallic glasses requires strict conditions, such as high purity of raw materials, rapid cooling, and high vacuum. Clearly, it is imperative to develop new materials which should have high degradation efficiency, low cost and can be easily prepared.

Scientific  RepoRts  | 6:34213 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34213Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are emerging as a new class of metallic materials. Distinct from con-
ventional alloys based mostly on one principal elements, HEAs are generally designed to contain at least five 
principal elements with equal or near-equal atomic percent22,23. The multi-principal elements feature leads to high 
mixing entropy and facilitates the formation of simple solid solution phases such as face-centered cubic (FCC) and/or body-centered cubic (BCC)
24 and/or hexagonal closed-packed (HCP)25 which has been reported recently. 
In addition, due to different atomic sizes of constituents, the lattice of simply structured HEAs usually is severely distorted. These intrinsic features render HEAs unique properties
26, such as high hardness27,28, high strength29, 
extraordinary fracture toughness30, and excellent corrosion resistance31,32. Therefore, HEAs have attracted exten-
sive attention since their inception and become one of the research frontiers in the metallic materials field. Current researches on HEAs were mainly focused on mechanical properties, while functional properties, in particular chemical and catalytic properties, were seldom explored. It is interesting to notice that the solid-solution phase in HEAs are indeed firstly formed upon solidification, which are then kept to the ambient temperature due to the 
sluggish diffusion kinetics of HEAs, in a way analogous to the amorphous phase formation via the rapid solid-
ification route
33. So, in a way like metallic glasses34, HEAs are metastable thermodynamically compared to the 
ordinary crystalline alloys for the atoms residing on the high energy state as a result of the severe lattice distor -
tion33,35. In view of the good chemical and catalytic properties of glassy alloys36,37, it is expected that the metastable 
HEAs could also possess excellent properties in degrading contaminants. Unfortunately, up to date, there is no any report about HEAs in this regard yet. Herein, we report degradation performances of three HEAs synthesized by mechanical alloying, i.e., AlCoCrTiZn (Sample1, denoted as S1), AlCoCrFeNi (Sample2, denoted as S2), and CoCrFeMnNi (Sample3, denoted as S3). The investigation demonstrates that the HEAs powders have higher 
reaction efficiency in degrading azo dyes than commercial zero-valent ion powders. In particular, the newly devel-
oped AlCoCrTiZn HEA powder exhibits an excellent performance, which is comparable to the best performance reported in metallic glasses so far. Our findings certainly will extend applications of HEAs as functional materials.
Results
Characterization of HEA powders. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of S1, S2 and S3 after milling for 60 h 
are shown in Fig. 1a. It is seen that the S1 and S2 powders have a BCC structure while the S3 powder shows a FCC structure. The BCC structure of S1 after milling for 60 h was further verified by the transmission election micros-
copy (TEM) bright field image (Fig. 1b) and its corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (the inset in Fig. 1b). The crystalline feature of S1 was also clearly confirmed by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) 
observation (Fig. 1c), in which one can find obvious lattice fringes (highlighted with red lines in Fig. 1c) and 
defects attributed to the long-time ball milling. The scanning election microscopy (SEM) images of the S1, S2 and S3 powders after milling for 60 h are shown in Fig. 2a–2c, respectively. It is obvious that all the three powders are 
uniformly dispersed and have irregular profiles. The surfaces are rough and full of corrugations (see the corre-sponding insets in Fig. 2), which have significant effects on the degrading performance as will be discussed later on. The size distribution of the powders is presented in Fig. 3, and as shown, all the three HEA powders have a rather narrow size distribution from 1.0 to 13.0 μ m. The statistic average size is 7.0, 6.5 and 7.2 μ m in diameter for 
S1 (Fig. 3a), S2 (Fig. 3b) and S3 (Fig. 3b), respectively. The corresponding EDX analyses (the atomic percentages of Al, Co, Cr, Ti and Zn are 21.49%, 19.60%, 18.63%, 19.78% and 20.50%, respectively) of the powders verify that 
the actual composition of S1, S2 and S3 is close to the nominal. The specific surface area of the three samples was 
measured to be 3.635, 3.341 and 3.462 m
2/g by the BET analysis with nitrogen for S1, S2 and S3, respectively.
The azo dye degradation capacity of the HEA powders.  To test the degradation capacity of the result-
ant HEAs, we put 0.1 g HEA powders into 10 ml azo dye solution with a concentration of 0.2 g/L Direct Blue 
6 (DB6, C32H20N6S4O14Na4) each time. The representative appearance of the azo dye solution before and after 
degradation by HEA powders is shown in Fig. 4a. It is clear that the opaque blue solution becomes transparent, colorless water after degradation for 10  min. To quantitatively characterize the degrading kinetic behavior, we 
measured the concentration change of DB6 as a function of degrading time by the UV absorption spectrum. All the measured UV absorption spectra evolution with the degrading time exhibit a similar behavior. As an example, 
Fig. 4b shows a representative absorption curve for S1, and a diffuse peak was observed around 580 nm, corre-
sponding to the wavelength scale of green and yellow colors, caused by the azo bond “-N=  N-” . As the degradation 
reaction proceeds, the azo bond “-N= N-” breaks into two “-NH
2” , which is often observed in degrading azo dyes 
by zero-valent iron14 and metallic glasses21. With the increase of the reaction time, an appreciable decrease in the 
intensity of the absorption peak, which is proportional to the concentration of azo dye solution, can be observed. 
The degradation occurred at a quite fast rate during the first minute, accompanied by a sharp drop of the absorp-tion peak intensity. The azo dye was completely degraded without any detectable characteristic peaks after 10 min 
at 25 °C (Fig. 4b). In light of the quantitative UV absorption spectrum data, the degrading kinetic curve of HEA 
powders is plotted (Fig. 5), in comparison with that of other typical candidate materials. Apparently, the degra-dation rate of the S1 HEA powder at room temperature (25 °C) is faster than that of the Fe-Si-B amorphous alloy 
ribbon
21 and the ball-milled (BM) Fe-based metallic glass powders19, and is even comparable with that of BM 
MgZn-based metallic glass powders19 (Fig. 5a). It is worth noting that the dosage of agents in our case is lower 
than that reported in the literature while the azo dye solution possesses the same concentration of 0.2 g/L DB619,21. 
As comparison, Fig. 5b shows the degradation efficiencies for the S2 and S3 powders at 25  °C. In order to com -
pare the degradation capability at 25 °C of different materials quantitatively, the normalized intensity of the DB6 
concentration as a function of reaction time is plotted, which can be well fitted by an exponential decay function based on the pseudo-first-order kinetic model (solid lines in Fig. 5a and 5b), I  =  I
0 +  I1 exp(−  t/t0)16, where I  is 
the normalized intensity of concentration, I0 and I1 are fitting constants, t  is the reaction time and t0 is the time 
when the intensity decrease to e−1 of the initial condition. The degradation efficiency can be simply evaluated by 
the value of t0. Generally, HEAs are strong competitors of metallic glasses in the degradation efficiency (Fig. 5c). www.nature.com/scientificreports/3
Scientific  RepoRts  | 6:34213 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34213In particular, the efficiency of S1 ( t0 =  0.83 min) is outstanding and fairly close to that of the BM MgZn-based 
glassy powder (BM G-MgZn, t0 =  0.78  min)19, which is the best one reported in the metallic glasses so far. It 
was reported that the BM G-MgZn is about 20 times faster than the BM Fe-based glassy powder (BM G-Fe, 
t0 =  16 min) and 1000 times faster than the gas-atomization Fe-based glassy powder (GA G-Fe, t0 =  810 min) in 
degradation of DB617. It should be pointed out that the degradation efficiency of the BM G-Fe is about 200 times 
faster than that of the widely used commercial Fe powder17. Among the three HEAs, one can see that the newly 
developed S1 is the best (Fig. 5c) and its efficiency ( t0 =  0.83  min) is more than 10 times faster than that of S2 
(t0 =  8.42 min), S3 ( t0 =  9.59 min) and the G-FeSiB ribbon ( t0 =  8.70 min)21. Therefore, we will focus on the S1 for 
further analyses in the next section.
Effect of temperature on degradation efficiency.  It is known that temperature has a significant effect 
on the degradation rate. To understand the temperature effect in our case, we performed a series of degradation 
reactions under various temperatures ranging from 25 to 55  °C with an interval of 10  °C. Figure 6a shows the 
variation of reaction efficiency with temperature for S1. Clearly, the higher the working temperature, the faster 
the degradation rate. Specifically, the t0 value drops from 0.83 at 25  °C to 0.34 at 55  °C. In addition, we estimated 
the thermal activation energy barrier Δ E with the Arrhenius-type equation, t0 =  τo exp(Δ E/RT), where τ0 is a 
time pre-factor and R the gas constant38. By plotting ln t0 versus 1000/ RT curves, we obtained Δ E for the S1 and Fe

Scientific  RepoRts  | 6:34213 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34213powders synthesized by different techniques (Fig. 6b). The estimated Δ E value for S1 is 30  kJ/mol, which is only 
half of the BM G-Fe powder (78  kJ/mol17) and quarter of the GA G-Fe powder (114  kJ/mol17). The Δ E value of S1 
is comparable with that of the BM G-MgZn powder, i.e., 51  ±  23 kJ/mol19. These results indicate that the newly 
developed S1 HEA powder can reduce the energy barrier for the degradation reaction effectively and thus make 
the occurrence of reaction easier as compared with other materials such as the glassy Fe-based powders.
Discussion
As described above, the HEA powders have excellent performance on the degradation of azo dyes. In particular, 
S1 (i.e., the AlCoCrTiZn HEA) possesses superior degradation efficiency and good catalytic activity, which is 
much better than the commonly used zero-valent iron and recently developed BM Fe-based metallic glass pow -
ders. To further understand the underlying degradation mechanism, the intermediate products and the pathway 
of the reduction of azo dyes by S1 were also identified by high resolution mass spectra (HRMS). Similar to pre -
vious work14,15, Orange II was chosen as the original azo dye because of its simple structure which will provide 
convenience for HRMS testing. Figure 7a shows the HRMS result of Orange II with a concentration of 0.2  g/L 
degraded by S1 (dosage of 0.01  g/ml) for 15  min. As can be seen, Orange II was confirmed by the negative mode 
before degradation but after 15  min, Orange II completely degraded and only the sulfanilic acid was detected. 
From this test, it is known that the first step of the degradation of Orange II is the breaks of azo bond “-N = N-” , 
which is consistent with literature data14,15. In this case, sulfanilic acid and 1-amino-2-naphthol are supposed 
to be the possible intermediates. However, 1-amino-2-naphthol does not appear in Fig. 7a due probably to its 
auto-oxidation21. The above HRMS result confirms that the degradation of the azo dyes by S1 is similar to the 
reaction catalyzed by either crystalline iron powders or metallic glasses, namely, S1 provides electrons for the 
electron-deficient azo bonds, as the water providing the hydrogen, to disassemble the azo dyes into two parts. The 
reaction equation can be described by the expression shown in Fig. 7b.

Scientific  RepoRts  | 6:34213 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34213The promising performance of our HEA powders in degrading contaminants is attributed mainly to the fol -
lowing three factors. The first one is the unique atomic structure of HEAs. Although HEAs were often character -
ized globally by simple solid solution phases, such as single FCC or BCC, their atomic arrangements are actually 
complex by nature due to their random or quasi-random atomic occupancies of the multiple principal elements. 
In fact, a precise description on the atomic occupancies of each constituent in HEAs remains a scientific chal -
lenge in the field. Currently, it is generally accepted that the lattice of HEAs is severely distorted due to the dis -
tinct differences of the atomic sizes among the constituent elements and the disordered atomic arrangements33,35. 
Apparently, the severe lattice distortion gives rise to nontrivial atomic level stresses and eventually makes atoms 
locate in thermodynamically non-equilibrium sites of the lattice39. We calculated the intrinsic residual strain 
with the method proposed by Y e et al.40. The result of calculation indicates that the root-mean-square (R.M.S.) 
residual strain of the excellent AlCoCrTiZn HEA is 4.92%, while the value for the CoCrFeMnNi and AlCoCrFeNi 
HEAs are 3.25% and 2.96%, respectively. As claimed by Y e et al. , the transition from a single phase solid solu -
tion to multi-phased structure takes place at the R.M.S. residual strain of ~5%. The R.M.S. residual strain of 
AlCoCrTiZn, i.e., 4.92%, resides on the upper bound of the range of single phase solid solution. Meanwhile, we 
also calculated the delta-parameters with the method proposed by Zhang et al.41 to estimate the intrinsic lattice 
distortion of AlCoCrTiZn, CoCrFeMnNi and AlCoCrFeNi, which are 4.67%, 4.74% and 2.74%, respectively. As 
reported by Zhang et al.41, the solid solution structure is correlated with the delta-parameter of ~6%. The value 
of delta-parameter of AlCoCrTiZn, i.e. 4.67%, also locates at the upper bound of the range of single phase solid 
Figure 3.  Size distribution of different HEA powders after being milled 60  h. (a) S1, ( b) S2 and ( c) S3.www.nature.com/scientificreports/6
Scientific  RepoRts  | 6:34213 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34213solution. In other words, the unique solid solution structure of HEAs virtually is in a non-equilibrium state where 
atoms possess  high potential energy and are thus much more active than those in conventional alloys. As a result, 
the HEA needs a less energy to activate the reaction with the DB6 with respect to other materials. This point can 
be verified by the activation energy data. As shown in Fig. 6b, the activation energy barrier Δ E for the HEA (e.g., 
S1) is only half of the BM G-Fe powder and a quarter of the GA G-Fe powder, demonstrating that the HEA has a 
higher reactivity during degradation than the glassy Fe-based powders. This is the structural reason why the HEA 
exhibits a high degradation efficiency (Fig. 5c).
The second factor to affect the degradation properties of HEAs is the specific chemical composition. The chem -
ical characteristics, especially the activity, of the constituent elements are also closely associated with the deg -
radation performances of the resultant alloy. For instance, compared with S2 and S3 HEAs, S1 HEA exhibits a 
much better degradation capability, although they all have single-phase solid solution structures. This result can 
be qualitatively understood in terms of the activity of constituent metals. According to the activity series of met -
als42, the activity rank of the constituent elements in the studied HEAs is Al  >  Ti >  Mn >  Zn >  Cr >  Fe >  Co >  Ni.  
By comparing their chemical constituents of the HEA powders, one can find out that the constituents in the S1 
HEA (AlCoCrTiZn) are of relative higher activity than those in the S2 (AlCoCrFeNi) and S3 (CoCrFeMnNi) 
HEAs. The degradation of azo dyes is essentially corresponding to the reduction of azo dyes. In the present case, 
it is the reduction of the azo bond “-N = N-” into two “-NH2” by the reducing agents, i.e., the HEA powders. The 
higher reactivity of constituents, the stronger reducing agents, leading to the faster reaction kinetics. Therefore, it is 
reasonable to infer that the chemical activity of constituent elements should be one of the decisive causes to the high 
degradation efficiency of the S1. Moreover, it is expected that the degradation efficiency of HEAs can be improved 
further by designing HEAs bearing elements with higher activities, such as Mg or Ca. However, it is kind of risky 
to synthesize HEAs containing high activity elements by the regular ball-milling due to the possibility of explosion 
at elevated temperatures. Thus, it is necessary to exploit a low-temperature ball-milling machine which is usually 
cooled by liquid nitrogen to produce HEA powders bearing Mg or Ca. The further investigation is in progress.
Thirdly, the ball milling process plays a nontrivial role in affecting the degradation performance. It is known 
that ball milling process, especially for the long-time ball milling, could lead to severe plastic deformation and 
high residual stresses, which can push the atoms to the saddle points of the potential energy landscape and there -
fore can reduce activation energy barrier effectively. As evidenced by Wang et al.17, for the glassy Fe-based pow -
ders with a same composition, the activation energy for the BM powders is about 40  kJ/mol lower than that for the 
gas atomized powders. Moreover, the ball milling process makes the surface of particles rough and full of corruga -
tions (Fig. 2), leading to the significant increase of the specific surface area. To illustrate this point, we measured 
the specific surface areas for two kinds of HEA powders, which have the same composition of S3 and similar 
average particle size (~17  μ m) while they were prepared respectively by BM and GA techniques. The results show 
that the specific surface area is 1.722 and 1.124  m2/g for the BM and the GA powders, respectively, verifying the 
significant increase in specific surface area for the sample after the BM process. To further demonstrate this result 
intuitively, we compared the surface profile of the GA powders with that of the BM powders. As shown in Fig. 8, 
the GA powder has a smooth surface (Fig. 8a) while the BM powder possesses a corrugated one (Fig. 8b), which 
renders the high specific surface area of the BM powders. It is known that high specific surface area is beneficial 
for the reaction rate and/or capacity due to more active spots generated. Consequently, the ball milling process 
has a substantial contribution to the excellent performance of the HEAs on degrading azo dye. Actually, similar 
results were also reported in the BM G-Fe powder17.
In addition, it is noticed that surface chemical segregation has a significant effect on surface activity, and is 
critical for degradation performance. In fact, surface segregation has been widely investigated for various alloys, 
especially bimetallic nanoparticles, applied in the field of catalyst engineering43,44. For example, Janik-Czachor 
et al.  modified the surface activity of Cu-based amorphous alloys by making a selective surface segregation of 
Figure 4.  (a) Appearances of the DB6 solution before and after degradation by S1, and ( b) changes of the UV 
absorption spectra of S1 measured at 25  °C as a function of the treating time.www.nature.com/scientificreports/7
Scientific  RepoRts  | 6:34213 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34213Cu with chemical processes, leading to a substantial increase in the catalytic efficiency of dehydrogenation of 
aliphatic alcohols43. In our case, however, surface chemical segregation of the as-milled HEA powders should 
be subtle due to the fact that mechanical alloying is capable for homogenizing chemical elements23. In fact, our 
EDX analyses for different sites of the HEA particles indicate that there is no obvious chemical heterogeneity. 
As such, effects of surface chemical segregation on the degradation performance can be negligible in the case of 
as-milled HEA powders. On the other hand, the ball milling process renders the samples abundant of corruga -
tions and defects on the particle surfaces, as shown in Figs 1b, 2 and 8b, which enhance the surface activity of the 
HEA powers effectively by providing a great deal of surface active spots for degradation reactions. In this regard, 
therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the good performance of S1-AlCoCrTiZn HEA is closely related to its high 
surface activity.
It is critical for the engineering application of HEAs in degrading azo dyes to clarify the concern whether the 
HEA powders generate secondary pollution or not during the degradation of azo dye solutions. To address this 
issue, we utilized the ICP (inductive coupled plasma) technique to detect the concentrations of metal ions in the 
treated solution. The results indicate that the ion concentrations of all the five constituents in the treated solutions 
are below their detection limits of the machine, i.e., 0.067, 0.016, 0.017, 0.005 and 0.012  μ g/ml for Al, Co, Cr, Ti

not induce secondary pollution.
In summary, we demonstrated that the HEA powders synthesized by mechanical alloying, particularly the 
newly developed AlCoCrTiZn HEA, exhibited high efficiency in degradation of azo dye, comparable with the best 
metallic glasses. The combination of unique atomic structure with severe lattice distortion, chemical composition

Scientific  RepoRts  | 6:34213 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34213effect, residual stress and high specific surface area is responsible for the observed excellent capability of HEAs 
in degrading azo dye. Our findings manifest that the newly developed HEAs has great potential to be utilized as 
catalyst materials such as purifying wastewater, and the current study broadens application ranges of HEAs.
Methods
Synthesis of high entropy alloy powders.  Al, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn elemental powders with high 
purity ( > 99.5%) and particle size of less than 45  μ m were used as raw materials to synthesize equal-atomic 
AlCoCrTiZn, AlCoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi HEAs by mechanical alloying. The milling was carried out in high 
energy planetary ball miller at 300  rpm with a ball to powder ratio of 15:1. Stainless steel vials and balls were 
used as the milling media and n-heptane was utilized as the process controlling agent (PCA) in order to keep 
off from excessive cold welding. In addition, high purity argon gas was used for protection. The powder samples 
were extracted at a certain interval of 5  h to confirm the alloy formation. After 60  h of milling the powders were 
completely taken out for further characterization and testing.
Reaction process.  The azo dye, direct blue 6 (i.e., DB6, C32H20N6S4O14Na4, CAS 2602-46-2) and Orange 
II (C16H11N2SO4Na, CAS 633-96-5) were purchased from Hailan Chemical Pigment Co. (Tianjin, China). 
Deionized water was used as the solvent throughout the experiment. The concentration of both DB6 and Orange 
II solutions used was 0.2  g/L in this work. For all the degradation tests, 0.1  g HEA powders were dissolved into 
10 ml of azo dyes solution for reaction. At preset reaction time intervals, about 5  ml solution was removed and 
filtered to measure the ultraviolet-visible (UV) absorption spectrum.
Characterization.  Atomic structure of the milled samples was studied by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) 
(MXP21V AHF, Cu Kα) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2010). The TEM samples were pre -
pared by dropping powders dispersed in absolute ethanol upon copper grids with carbon film as voids support. 
After the absolute ethanol completely volatilized, the samples then be investigated by TEM. The morphology 
and size distribution were studied by SEM (Zeiss Supra 55), and the compositions of the milled powders were 
examined by EDX equipped on the SEM. The statistic distribution of size was obtained by laser particle ana -
lyzer (Mastersizer 2000). Thermal analysis was carried out in a differential scanning calorimeter (NETZSCH 
DSC 404F1). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis of the powders was performed using the 
nitrogen adsorption method with a surface analyser (NOV A4000). The UV absorption spectrums were recorded 
using an UV spectrometer (Unico 2800). The concentrations of metal ions left behind the treatment solution 
were measured by ICP emission spectrometer (Leeman PROFILE SPEC). The intermediate products and the 
pathway of the reduction of azo dyes by S1 were identified by high resolution mass spectra (HRMS, LCMS-IT/
