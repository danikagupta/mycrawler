Abstract.  The presence of h igh concentrations of chemical oxygen demand ( COD ), biochemical oxygen 
demand  (BOD ) and nutrients in wastewater generated industrially or domestically has resulted in 
significant water pollution situations and subsequently is leading to adverse health prob lems. Algae have 
been used in various applications in environmental biotechnology especially for phycoremediation as a 
tertiary wastewater treatment strategy through assimilation of high concentration of nitrogen and 
phosphorus for their growth, thus reduc ing potential eutrophication problems. This article discusses the 
role of phycoremediation to remove  COD, BOD and  nutrients from wastewater. The mechanism for 
nutrient removal from wastewater, challenges to process development and current commercial -scale 
algae -based wastewater treatment are reviewed too. It appears that phycoremediation plays a vital role to 
treat wastewaters efficiently.

Introduction  
In the last few decades, the rapid popula tion growth, industrial revolution, and 
urbanization have led to various forms of environmental pollution. The disposal of 
untreated wastewater (e.g. industrial, municipal, palm oil mill effluent, amongst others) 
directly into water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans is considered a simple and 
cheap discharge method in communities where wastewater disposal is not well 
regulated (Chan et al., 2009). This contributes significantly to water shortage. In 
addition, the potential of high concentrations of t oxic pollutants moves into human and 
animal food chain could result in significant health problems (Barakat, 2011).  
The quality of water will degrade when untreated wastewater discharged into the 
receiving water body (e.g. rivers, streams, lakes) and lead to the problem of clean water 
for human consumption. Besides that, the discharged of wastewater containing the 
excessive amount of nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus) into the receiving water body 
can also lead to another problem like eutrophication resu lted in the depletion of oxygen 
level in the water (Lau et al., 1997). Generally, phosphorus in the form of 
orthophosphates is known as the limiting nutrient in the freshwater system. However, 
runoff wastewater containing extremely concentration of phospho rus can lead to the 
eutrophication (Cai et al., 2013). The abnormally low level of oxygen in the water body 
can harm aquatic life by inducing the reduction of aquatic animals (e.g. fishes, prawns, 
among others) and microorganisms (e.g. bacteria, fungi, alg ae) population (S perling and 
Chernicharo, 2005).  Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

 2019 , ALÖK I Kft., Budapest, Hungary  According to Driscoll et al. (2003) and Smith (2003), the eutrophication in fresh and 
coastal or marine ecosystems also leads to some problems such as water discoloration 
and foaming and increasing in blooms  of toxic algal species and their biomass, 
mortality rate of aquatic species, sedimentation of organic particles as well as 
decreasing in water transparency.  
Nitrate occurs naturally in water; however, it is undesirable substance in public water 
because of  its high concentration in drinking water may either cause serious health 
problems like methemoglobinemia (blue -baby syndrome) or source of nitrosamines 
after its reduction to nitrite (Schoema n and Steyn, 2003; Abdel -Raouf et al. , 2012). 
According to Abdel -Raouf et al. ( 2012) also stated that the purpose of removing 
phosphate from wastewater is to protect water from eutrophication.  
Treated wastewaters obtained from conventional treatments remain undesirable for 
discharge because of their characteristics sti ll not able to meet the standards set by local 
authorities (Loh et al. , 2013). Therefore, more effective treatment technologies are 
required in order to reduce the exposure of toxic chemicals to natural ecosystems. The 
use of microalgae to treat wastewater  and hazardous contaminants is currently of global 
interest due to the effective photosynthetic uptake of high concentrations of minerals, 
ionogens, and organics by microalgae, and the capacity to simultaneously utilize carbon 
dioxide (CO 2) (Mohan et al. , 2001; Zeng et al., 2012). Microalgae cells have the ability 
to remove nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonium as well as heavy metals in 
wastewater (Phang and Ong, 1988; Aziz and Ng, 1992; Sydney et al., 2011; Abdel -
Raouf et al., 2012 ). A life cyc le economic assessment has shown that, for microalgae 
cultivation, the growth media formulation and composition contribute significantly to 
the operating cost and is a major consideration for scale -up design (Clarens et al., 2009; 
Lam and Lee, 2011). Hence  there is the need to look into cheaper nutrients sources, and 
wastewaters containing the right nutrients compositions could be a viable alternative. 
This will also reduce the cost of microalgae biomass generation for the production of 
biofuels, animal fee d, and  essential oils amongst others. Meanwhile, the microalgae 
biomass production after treatment of heavy metal from wastewaters  can be used as a 
potential feedstock for  biochar,  charcoal, biofuel  and biogas  production  (Safonova et al., 
2004; Chinnasamy et al. , 2010 ; Poo et al. , 2018) . Therefore, the aims of this paper are to 
comprehensively review the current use of both free cells and immobilized algae in 
treating wastewaters to obtain some new ideas to deal with wastewaters without having 
a negative effect on the environment.  
Microalgae and macroalgae  
Algae are aquatic plant -like organisms (phytoplankton) with various shapes. They 
lack roots, stems, and leaves, with cell walls ma de of cellulose. Algae cells are divided 
into macroalgae and microalgae. Macroalgae are multicellular organisms with size up to 
several meters while microalgae are small organisms (unicellular) with their size in the 
range 0.2 -100 µm (Bhatt et al., 2014).  
Sharma et al. ( 2011) categorized microalgae into several groups: (i) prokaryotic blue -
green (cyanobacteria); (ii) eukaryotic green ( Chlorophyceae ); (iii) eukaryotic brown 
(Phaeophyceae ); (iv) eukaryotic red ( Rhodophyceae ); and (v) eukaryotic diatoms 
(Bacil lariophceae ) as shown in Table 1 . 
According to Brennan and Owende (2010) and Mata et al.  (2010), algae are 
photosynthetic prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganisms that can grow rapidly and Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

multicellular structure. They are thallophytes containing chlorophyll as their main 
photosynthetic pigment. In fact, microalgae have more effective access to carbon 
dioxide, water (H 2O) and nutrients due to their simple cellular structure c ompared to 
terrestrial plants. As a result, they are known to have very high carbon capturing and 
photosynthetic efficiencies with the ability to convert solar energy into useful biomass 
and reduce CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere more efficiently than  terrestrial plants 
(Packer, 2009; Kumar et al., 2013).

Metabolism of microalgae  
Generally, the growth of microalgae biomass depends on carbon source and photons 
to perform photosynthesis (Costa and de Morais, 2013). Microalgae can modify their 
internal structure by both biochemica l and physiological acclimations. Externally, they 
can also excrete various compounds to other cells, supply nutrients or l imit the growth 
of competitors.  
Autotrophic microalgae use inorganic compounds and sunlight as a carbon and 
energy source. In the pre sence of light, these autotrophic microalgae are referred to as 
photoautotrophic since they use light photons as an energy source to generate chemical 
energy by photosynthesis (Amaro  et al. , 2011). During photosynthesis by aut otrophic 
algae, CO 2 and water are converted into carbohydrate (glucose) and further metabolized 
to yield energy which drives the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fr om 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP).  The energy in ATP is then used to drive various 
processes in the cell s, and in do ing so is converted back to ADP ready to pick up more 
energy to enable growth (Brennan and Owende, 2010). Heterotrophic microalgae use 
solely organic compounds and exogenous nutrients as a source of carbon and energy for 
growth in dark conditions (Amaro et  al., 2011). According to Huang et al. (2010), 
cultivation of heterotrophic microalgae overcomes problems associated with limited 
light photons that affect the attainment of high cell s densities during photosynthesis. 
Some microalgae are mixotrophic, with the capacity to exist as autotrophic or 
heterotrophic depending on the concentration of organic compound and also the 
availability of light (Chojnacka and Noworyta, 2004).  Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

 2019 , ALÖK I Kft., Budapest, Hungary  Phycoremediation  
Microalgae have been used in various applications of environmental biotechnology 
especially for bioremediation (e.g. phycoremediation). Bioremediation is the part of 
environmental biotechnology that uses a biological process to treat contaminants 
(Boopathy, 2000). Gani et al. (2015 a), Rao et al. ( 2011), and Olguin (2003) defined 
phycoremediation as the use of algae to remove or transform pollutants, including 
nutrients and toxic chemicals from  wastewater and CO 2 from waste air to gether with 
biomass p roduction. W astewaters treatment by microalgae can be performed in the for m 
of suspended free -cells culture and immobilized cell s. The suspended free -cells culture 
is the condition of microalgae  living cells move independently  within the bottles 
containing medium under a condition to ensure uniform cells distribution (Katarzyna  et 
al., 2015) . Meanwhile, the immobilized cells is the condition of microalgae  living  cells 
be prevented from flow freely from its original location to all parts of the medium. This 
approach can be performed by keeping the microalgae living cells in the carriers such as 
NaCS -PDMDAAC capsules  (Zeng et al ., 2012) , alginate  (Sumithrabhai et al., 2016)  and 
chitosan beads  (Fierro et al., 2008) . 
The use of suspended free -microalgae  cells culture  to treat wastewater was first 
studied b y Oswald et al. ( 1957). The process involves the removal of nitrog en and 
phosphorus from wastewater whilst simultaneously providing oxygen  (O2) for aerobic 
bacteria coexisting in the culture. Biologically treating wastewater using microalgae is a 
reliable process due to the high photosynthetic efficiency and growth rates . 
Furthermore, microalgae have effective nutrient uptake capacity with the potential to 
achieve great removal of nitrogen and phosphorus as well as heavy metals from 
wastewater (Hernandez  et al.,  2006; Hameed, 2007; Sengar  et al. , 2011; Abdel -Raouf  et 
al., 2012).  
Microalgae require significant amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen for proteins 
synthesis (45 -60% microalgae dry weight), nucleic acids and phospholipids for their 
growth (Rao et al., 2011). In this respect, nutrient removal using microalgae present s 
major prospects for tertiary wastewater treatment aimed at removing ammonia, nitrate, 
and phosphate (Rawat et al., 2011; Abdel -Raouf  et al. , 2012; Gani et al., 2015 b). After 
nutrient uptake by microalgae during wastewater treatment, the purified water ca n be 
decanted to harvest the free cells microalgae ( Abdel -Raouf et al., 2012 ). 
Phycoremediation has been used in various applications: (i) removal of nutrients 
from organic matter -rich wastewater; (ii) removal of nutrients and xenobiotic 
compounds using al gae-derived sorbents; (iii) treatment of heavy metal -rich 
wastewater; (iv) s equestration of CO 2; (v) transformation and degradation of xenobiotic; 
and (vi) detection of toxic compounds using algae -based biosensors. Application of 
phycoremediation for waste water treatment has significant benefits (Eroglu et al., 2012; 
Sivakumar and Rajendran, 20 13; Whangchenchom et al., 2014; Gani et al., 2015 a). The 
following are key characteristics of the process.  
 
i. It is cost -effective, eco -friendly and safe.  
ii. Microalgae us ed are non -pathogenic photosynthetic organisms and produce non -
toxic substances.  
iii. It efficiently reduces nutrient load and leads to a reduction in total dissolved 
solid.  
iv. It detoxifies and removes pollutants (e.g. heavy metals) from toxic waste -rich 
sludge m ore effectively than conventional chemical treatment technologies.  Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

Figure 1  shows the schematics of mixed microbial community -based treatment of 
wastewater exploiting the metabolic relationship between microalgae and bacteria. First, 
the bacteria proliferate and produce CO 2 for microalgae growth. The CO 2 is used by the 
microalgae during photosynthesis in the presence of light to produce O 2 which is 
assimilated by the ba cteria for growth. According to Sharma and Khan (2013), 
microalgae produce oxygen from water as a by -product of photosynthesis and bacteria 
use the oxygen to oxidize organic compounds. During photosynthesis, the end product 
of bio -oxidation of organic comp ounds namely, carbon dioxide, is further fixed into 
cells carbon by microalgae. As a result, the pollutants level in wastewater are reduced to 
undetectable or acceptable limits set by local authorities.

Generally, the generated microalgae biomass from wastewater treatment process is 
used for agriculture (fertilizer and soil conditioners) and biofuels industries (Eroglu et 
al., 2012). In this respect, the cultivati on of microalgae using wastewater serves a dual 
role of pollutants load reduction and production of various valuable products.  
Mechanisms of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal in phycoremediation  
Elements like carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and, sulfur together with small amounts 
of trace metals (e.g. sodium, calcium, iron etc.) are required for algae growth. Amongst

2013).  
Autotrophic microalgae fix carbon (in th e form of CO 2) biologically from the 
atmosphere by photosynthesis. Microalgae can also use carbon in the form of soluble 
carbonates for their growth, either by direct uptake or conversion of ca rbonate to free 
CO 2 through a carboanhydrase activity (Cai et a l., 2013).  
Nitrogen in wastewater is present in the form of NH 4+ (ammonia), NO 2- (nitrite) and 
NO 3- (nitrate) (Hadiyanto  et al. , 2013). The conversion of inorganic nitrogen into 
organic forms can be carried out by eukaryotic microalgae via assimilation (Cai et al., 
2013) . Figure 2  shows the steps involved in the conversion of inorganic nitrogen into 
organic forms. Firstly, translocation of inorganic nitrogen takes places across the plasma 
membrane of the algae cell s with subsequent reduction to nitrate and nitrite by nitrate 
and nitrite reductase, respectively. The next step is the conversion of ammonium into 
amino acids (glutamine). Nitrate reductase utilizes the reduced form of nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to transfer two electrons in the react ion for the 
conversion of nitrate into nitrite. Next, nitrite is further reduced to ammonium by nitrite 
reductase and ferredoxin (Fd) to transfer six electrons in the reaction. All inorganic 
forms of nitrogen are reduced to ammonium before being incorporat ed into amino acids 
within the intracellular fluid. Finally, glutamine synthase using glutamate (Glu) and 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) facilitates the incorporation ammonium into amino acids 
(glutamine) (Cai et al., 2013).

The phosphorus present in lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins as well as intermediates 
of carbohydrate metabolism is a result of phosphorus uptake. Inorganic phosphorus in 
the form of phosphates plays a crucial role in the growth of algae cell s and also their 
energy metabolism. According to Martínez et al. (1999), algae metabolism relies mostly 
on inorganic phosphorus in the forms of hydrogen phosphate (HPO 42-) and dihydr ogen

phosphorylation process involving the production of ADP -derived ATP together with 
energy input. The oxidation of respiratory substrates, electron transport system of 
mitocho ndria, or light (photosynthesis) is all sources of energy input. Phosphates are 
transferred across the plasma membrane of the algal cell s for utilization.  
The nitrate and phosphate in the wastewater are adsorbed through the matrix pore 
surface of microcaps ules membrane. After that, the uptake and assimilation of nitrate 
and phosphate ion by immobilized microalgae cells for growth occur and result in the 
reduction of N and P content in wastewater and further improves the quality of 
wastewater for discharge ( Zeng et al., 2012).  
Selection of microalg ae species for phycoremediation  
The selection of microalgae species for wastewater treatment is a critical 
consideration. According to Shi et al. (2007) and Olguin (2003), the selection of 
microalgae species for was tewater treatment should consider its robustness against 
wastewater pollutants, the capability to grow well (high growth rates), and their 
efficiency in assimilating nutrient from wastewater. A lot of studies focusing on various 
species of microalgae culti vated in wastewater for the removal of nitrogen and 
phosphorus have been reported. Scenedesmus , Chlorella , and Botryococcus  are 
commonly used microalgae for removing nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus),  COD and 
BOD as shown in Table 2 .

Application of phycoremediation in treating wastewater using suspended -free cells of 
microalgae  
Microorganisms especially microalgae have received significant attention in 
wastewater treatment. This is due to their capability to take up and assimilate plant 
nutrients, pesticides, organic and inorganic pollutants in their unicellular structure 
(Sahu, 2014). According to Pittman et al. (2011), a lot of microalgae species thrive in 
wastewater containing high concentration of nitrogen  and phosphorus and use them as a 
vital source of energy for their growth. This leads to significant uptake and reduct ion of 
nutrient concentrations.  
Cultivation of microalgae in wastewater treatment system offers several advantages. 
The process is simple,  economical and sustainable. Zhou et al. (2012) reported that 
growing microalgae in wastewater is probably the most promising approach to reduce 
costs of production in term of nutrients and clean water supply. Furthermore, Rawat et 
al. (2011) reported that  readily available municipal wastewater can be used as a growth 
media to cultivate microalgae together with the added benefits of bioremediation (e.g . 
phycoremediation).  
Chlorella  sp. reduced COD (15%), total nitrogen ( TN) (91%), ammonium ( NH 4+) 
(100%) and  total phosphorus ( TP) (93%) from synthetic aquaculture for 22 days 
(Komolafe et al., 2014). It has been shown that C. vulgaris  grown in sewage wastewater 
accomplished removal of BOD (98.70%), COD (98.30%),  total kjeldahl nitrogen ( TKN ) 
(93.10%), nitrate ( NO 3-) (98.30%), TP (98%) and (phosphate) PO 43- (98.60%) (Wang et 
al., 2010). As Whangchenchom et al., (2014) reported that Scenedesmus  sp. was capable 
of removing 73.37% of COD from wastewaters in Thailand. Suspended free -cell of 
Scenedesmus  sp., cultivate d in synthetic 2f medium reduced NO 3- and PO 43- by 20% and 
30%, respectively (Fierro et al., 2008). Removal of TN, NO 3-, NH 4+, and TP from 
piggery wastewater using Scenedesmus  obliquus  was achieved at 60, 84, 57 and 83%, 
respectively (Ji et al., 2013). Sac ristán de Alva et al., (2013) and Su et al. (2012) used 
others strains of Scenedesmus  species to treat wastewater. High removal of NO 3-, 
(nitrite) NO 2-, NH 4+, and PO 43- were achieved  as compared to Kothari et al. ( 2013) 
using Chlamydomonas  polypyrenoideum . Gokulan et al. (2013) evaluated the nutrients 
removal efficiency of Botryococcus braunii  in greywater samples collected from a 
hostel. They reported that B. braunii  removed 76.13%, 91.32%, 69.58%, 97.82%, 
97.59% of BOD, COD, NO 3-, NH 4+ and TP, re spectivel y. Ganeshkumar et al. ( 2018) 
studied the potential of Chlorella  sp. to treat mixed wastewater from piggery and 
winery in India. The treatment process was conducted for 10 days in at 23°C in an 
orbital shaker. The initial concentration of TN and TP of 284 m g/L and 11 mg/L was Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

removal of TN and TP up to 89.36% and 56.56%, respectively.  The removal efficiency 
of nutrients, COD and BOD from various wastewaters for other studie s were 
summarized in Table 2 . 
It can be summarized that the phycoremediation technology has the ability to remove 
nutrients from wastewaters up to certain removal efficiency. However, the removal 
efficiency of nutrients depends on the types of wastewaters and microalgae species to be 
treated and be used as bioremediation agent, respectively. Besides that, some 
microalgae species shown great removal efficiency of nitrogen removal from 
wastewaters. An explanation for this was due to the role of nitrogen to bu ild microalgae 
cells through anabolism pathway. Protein, chlorophyll, amino acids and also genetic 
materials are major made up of nitrogen (McElwee et al., 2006). Thus, the 
phycoremediation process has a potential to reduce the nitrogen to the lowest 
conce ntration from wastewaters.  
Rock minerals, soil erosion and animal waste decomposition are the natural sources 
of phosphorus in the aquatic system. Phosphorus removal from wastewaters is vital to 
avoid eutrophication problem. This problem could be achieved through 
phycoremediation process which exhibited great removal efficiency of phosphorus as 
shown in Table 2 . Table 2  also shows the phycoremediation process for various 
wastewaters using different types of microalgae species.  
Algae immobilization  
De-Bashan  and Bashan (2010) defined immobilized cells as living cells by which 
natural or artificial methods have been used to restrict independent movement from its 
original position to all part of an aqueous phase. Immobilization of microalgae in 
polymers can ove rcome problems associated with biomass harvesting from suspended 
free-cells cultivated in wastewater. Although solid -liquid separation technologies such 
as centrifugation and filtration can be used to separate free cells. There are several types 
of immobil ization: (i) covalent coupling (ii) affinity immobilization (iii) adsorption (iv) 
confinement in liquid -liquid emulsion (v) capture behind semi -permeable membrane; 
and (vi) entrapment in  polymers (Malik, 2002; Eroglu et al. , 2015). They can be further 
categorized into “passive” (immobilization onto natural or synthetic gel -like carriers) 
and “active” (using flocculants, chemical attachment, and gel encapsulation) (Moreno -
Garrido, 2008).  
Immobilization of microalgae by entrapment using gel polymers is the mo st common 
method in wastewater treatment applications ( Eroglu et al., 2015 ). There is a physical 
separation between the microorganisms and the treated wastewater in polymeric 
immobilization, and this is similar to biofiltration. The microalgae cells are im mobilized 
and entrapped alive in the polymer gel matrix. The gel pores are smaller in size than the 
microalgae. The wastewater fluid flows through the pores of the polymer and sustains 
microalgae metabolism and growth (Cohen, 2001). The wastewater diffuses  through the 
polymer pores, resulting in uptake of nutrients by the entrapped microalgae cells. 
Compared to suspended free -cells microalgae cultures cells, the following are some 
advantages of immobilized microalgae in treating wastewater : (i) provides sta bility to 
the photobioreactor (PBR) system design (ii) enhance operational stability (iii) e asy to 
regenerate immobilized microalgae (iv) avoids cell washout (v) f acilitates the 
cultivation of microalgae and easy  of harvesting of their biomass (vi) h igh an d rapid Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

and Bashan, 2010; Eroglu et al., 2015 ; Vasilieva et al., 2016).  
Successful entrapment allo ws microalgae cells to move freely within the space of 
beads with the optimal pore size that facilitates diffusion of wastewater and metabolic 
products into and/or out of the polymer system (Malik, 2002). According to Eroglu et 
al. (2015 ), the dual effect of enhanced photosynthetic rate and ionic exchange between 
the nutrient ions and the immobilized matrix results in efficient removal of nutrients 
from wastewater. Anionic gels (such as carrageenan and alginate) and cationic gels 
(such as chitosan) adsorb c ations (e.g. NH 4+) and anions (PO 43-, NO 3-, NO 2-) with high 
efficiency. In addition, PO 43- is removed efficiently from wastewater via precipitation 
by calcium ions of alginate or chitosan gels.  
Immobilizing materials or carriers can be put into two categor ies; synthetic and 
natural polymer ( Eroglu et al., 2015 ; Vasilieva et al., 2016). Examples of synthetic 
polymers for wastewater treatment include polyacrylamide, polyurethane, polyvinyl, 
polypropylene, and polystyrene, polysulfone, epoxy resins, and filter  papers. Natural 
polymers can be derived from plant polysaccharides. These include agar, cellulose, 
alginate, carrageenan, and chitosan. The immobilizing materials possess hydrophilic 
properties for enhanced diffusio n of wastewater into the beads.  
Natural polymers such as alginate, carrageenan, and chitosan are the most commonly 
used immobilizing material s in wastewater treatment (Shi et al. , 2007; Zhang et al., 
2008 ; Moreno -Garrido, 2008; Eroglu et al. , 2015; Sumithrabhai et al., 2016), and this 
due to the  following advantages. They are (i) non -toxic, easy to process, and cost -
effective; (ii) transparent and permeable; (iii) hydrophilic and have higher 
nutrient/product diffusion rates than synthetic polymers; (iv) more environmentally 
friendly and produces less hazardous waste following treatment; and (v) bio -compatible. 
The use of these natural polymers in wastewater treatment also poses some 
disadvantages. They are (i) less stable as they dissolve slightly in highly contaminated 
wastewater; (ii) do not ret ain their polymeric structure in the presence of high 
concentration of phosphate and some cations (e.g. calcium and magnesium); and (iii) 
susceptible to microbial degradation. However, the degradation of the natural polymer 
in highly contaminated wastewate r can be minimized by the composite assembly of 
polymers. For example, the stability of carrageenan gels can be enhanced by mixing the 
carrageen an with polyacrylamide (Eroglu et al. , 2015).  
There is a generic method for immobilizing microalgae onto polymer s. Briefly, the 
microbial suspension is mixed with the macromolecular monomers of the selected 
polymer (e.g. alginate, carrageenan, chitosan solution) to form polymeric gels (e.g. 
spherical beads produced via the small orifice of syringe) after solidificat ion. The

Factors affecting nutrients removal from wastewater in immobilized systems  
There are several factors that influence nutrient s removal from wastewater in 
immobilized systems. These include the thickness of immobilized media, concentration 
of microalgae, and amount of beads.  
The thickness of immobilized media  
Zhang et al. (2008) investigated the effect of the thickness of Scenede smus  sp. 
immobilized gel on the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus. They found out that gel 
thickness up to 3 mm is removed nutrients efficiently with higher algal biomass. 
Another studied by Hameed ( 2007) reported that small size beads with about 2.8 mm in  
diameter demonstrated higher removal efficiency for nitrate and phosphate than others 
beads (4 and 6 mm in diameter) in 48 h. Low thickness media facilitate convective 
transport of nutrients between the gel media and the nutrient environment.  
The concentr ation o f immobilized algae  
Too high cell density in gel results in low removal efficiency ( Zhang et al., 2008). 
Sodium alginate sheets (3 mm thickness) which containing microalgae with 2 x 108 
cells achieved higher nutrient removal compared to other sheets  with 1.33 x 108 and 3 x 
108 cell counts. Compared to low (3.5 x 105 cells) and high (3.10 x 106 cells/bead) cell 
stocking, calcium alginate beads containing microalgae cells (1.5×106 cells/bead) 
demonstrated a greater capacity to effectively remove NH 4+ and PO 43‒ from primary 
treated domestic wastewater (Hameed, 2007). They revealed that increasing cell s 
stocking in beads causes leakage problems and affects the removal efficiency of target 
pollutants from wastewater. According to Jimenez -Perez et al.  (2004), sup er-
concentrated cell s stockings may restrict to some extent the nutrient diffusion through 
the gel pores.  
The quantity of beads in wastewater  
The removal of target pollutants from wastewater is influenced by the quantity of 
beads containing algae cells use d in the wastewater treatment process. A more effective 
removal of nitrate and phosphate from wastewater was achieved by 11 beads of algae 
than 16, 32, and 64 beads (Hameed, 2007). Tam and Wong (2000) accomplished a great 
removal of NH 4+ and PO 43- from syn thetic primary treated domestic wastewater within 
24 h in bioreactors having an optimal algal bead concentration of 12 beads/mL 
equivalent to 1:3 algal beads: wastewater v/v. NH 4+ removal was significantly lower 
with 15 beads/mL algal concentration. They d iscussed that excessive increase in the 
quantity of beads results in high -density beads structure that hinders light penetration 
into cells and subsequently enhances self -shading effects, which limits the metabolic 
activities of microalgae. Moreover, the h igh concentration of beads results in the Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

Current commercial -scale in wastewater treatment systems using suspended free -
cells of microalgae  
There are sever al companies used algae for wastewater treatment practices 
worldwide for the commercial and industrial application. The companies that involve in 
algae -based energy (biogas) and fuel (biofuel and biodiesel) research are Algae 
Enterprises (Australia), Aquan os Energy Ltd. (Israel) and Fcc Aqualia (Spain). 
Adequate mass cultivation and harvesting of algae for algae biomass in wastewater is 
important to the aforementioned companies to achieve commercial viability. This is 
because the biomass can be used as feed stock for any biogas, biofuel, biodiesel or 
biofertilizer. According to the Website of these companies, they have developed 
different systems t o treat wastewater using algae.  
Algae Enterprises collaborated with the main shareholder, namely Sustainability 
Ventures Group have developed a technology, known as Photoluminescent Algae 
System (PAS) comprises of thin plastics embedded with fluorescent dyes in Australia  
(http://www.algaeenterprises.com/wastewater -treatment ). Based on this system, the 
growth of algae  is improved by fine -tuning the colors and wavelengths of incoming 
abundant sunlight that reaches the algae inside. This sustainable technology uses alga to 
remove pollutants including excessive nutrients from dairy wastewater in the presence 
of sunlight. In addition, this technology also integrates with the anaerobic digester to 
generate electricity through anaerobic digestion of harvested algae biomass to produce 
biogas with methane as the main component which can be used as a renewable source. 
Nutrient -rich residue materials (fertilizer product) resulting from the biogas generation 
are used for agriculture to produce even more algae. Meanwhile, the treated waste 
streams are recycled for irrigation and other purposes on the dairy farm.  
Aquonos Energy Ltd d eveloped a novel algae -based wastewater treatment system in 
Israel  (https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/aquanos ). The Aquanos 
system is characterized by lower energy consumption than conventional wastewater 
treatment system. Basically, thi s system consists of three distinct but interrelated 
processes namely, anaerobic treatment, aerobic treatment and separation of solid (algae) 
from treated effluent. The first stage is the anaerobic treatment of the incoming 
wastewater. The purpose of anaer obic treatment is to reduce the organic load to the 
downstream aerobic processes and at the same time to produce biogas for energy 
recovery as well as to produce CO 2. The second stage is the aerobic treatment of 
anaerobic effluent which takes place in the fix film aerobic system. The aerobic system 
is aerated by a stream of oxygen -rich algae which are grown in the separate raceway 
pond. Based on this system, the algae are grown in the raceway pond to produce high 
dissolved oxygen in the liquid. Then, this l iquid recirculates through the fix film system 
supplying oxygen for bacterial decomposition of organic pollutants. At the end of the 
process, namely solid separation stage is where the excessive algae and excessive 
biomass are separated from treated efflue nt. The treated effluent is discharged into the 
environment and reused for agriculture, while the excessive biomass is returned to the 
anaerobic stage to produce additional biogas. The end product is high -quality effluent 
produce using less energy than the  conventional system as well as resource harvesting 
through the production of high quality a nd high -level algae by -product.  Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

 2019 , ALÖK I Kft., Budapest, Hungary  Fcc Aqualia in Spain partnered with University of Southampton (England), BDI 
(Austria), Frounhofer Society (German), HyGear (Netherl ands) and Volkswagen 
(German) companies under All -Gas project for developing a new pond system to 
cultivate algae using nutrients present in the wastewater at wastewater treatment plant to 
produce biodiesel and biogas (methane) made from biomass to power v ehicles  
(https://www.power -technology.com/uncategorised/newsaqualias -biofuel -project -
produces -first-algae -biomass -in-spain/ ). Basically, they have two different processes of 
the sequential order under this project, namely All -Gas Alternative 1 (post lipid 
extraction) and All -Gas Alternative 2 (pre lipid extraction) to obtain biodiesel, 
biomethane, and biogas. For All -Gas Alternative 1, the incoming raw wastewater is pre -
treated and the effluent is discharged into raceway pond containing algae culture. After  
that, the dense algae culture is harvested and the treated wastewater is discharged to the 
environment, while the harvested algae biomass undergoes the anaerobic process in 
anaerobic digester. The biogas is produced during anaerobic treatment and the furt her 
undergo pre -treatment and upgrading process to obtain pure methane and CO 2, 
respectively. The biomethane are stored in the refueling station, while the CO 2 is 
supplied to the algae culture grown in the aforementioned raceway pond to promote 
high growth  rate and yield of algae. In addition, the remaining residue after anaerobic 
treatment in anaerobic digester undergoes dewatering method to concentrate prior to the 
extraction process to produce biodiesel and biofertilizer (remain residue). The All -Gas 
Alternative 2 has the same process of sequential order as All -Gas Alternative 1 but the 
lipid extraction process occurs directly upon harvesting. They produce approximately 
200000 L of biodiesel and 600000 m3 of biomethane per year from approximately 3000 
kg of dry algae with 20 percent of oil content after grown in ponds of 10 hectares. They 
claim that the Volkswagen vehicles that have been power using algae -based biogas emit 
zero emissions. The European Commission contributed about 12 million euro ($15.9 
million USD) for this project with the target of at least 10% renewable energy used in 
their transport sectors by 2020. So far, there is none company use immobilized algae to 
treat wastewaters commercially.  
Wastewater treatment challenges using suspended free -cells of microalgae  
To date, limited investments have been pushed into the development of commercial -
scale algal wastewater treatment plant, and this has been the result of technical 
challenges relating to scale -up feasibility, harvesting, and dewatering of biomass. 
Practical application of current emerging technologies is still in its infancy, with most of 
the technologies validated  only at the laboratory scale.  
Most algae are cultivated in closed PBRs for phycoremediation and biomass 
production (Kamarudi n et al., 2015; Lage et al., 2018). The expensive culture system 
with high capital cost and energy requirements for mixing and gas exchange together 
with the cost of harvesting to achieve feasible algal solid concentration has constrained 
the integration o f microalgal system with wastewater treatment at large -scale levels. 
This can partially be addressed through the use of other systems such as open raceway 
pond. However, environmental factors such as temperature fluctuation, weather 
influence, and light pe netration can affect the efficiency of phycoremediation and 
productivity of biomass.  
Algae require sufficient amount of CO 2 for growth. Thus, low -cost approach using 
flue gas from power plants as carbon source can be applied. However, the high Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

 2019 , ALÖK I Kft., Budapest, Hungary  concentratio n of substances like nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, and heavy metals presents 
in the flue gas causes the medium very acidic for algae cultivation. As a result, algae 
cultivation is prone to contamination and inhibition, resulting in low wastewater 
treatment  efficiency and low biomass production. Therefore, the flue gas can be pre -
treated to minimize contamination before exposure to the microalgae cells. The pre -
treatment process could significantly inc rease the total operation cost.  
Kamarudin et al. (2015) p ropose the following for consideration in algal POME 
treatment: (i) pre -treatment of wastewater to remove growth inhibitors; (ii) feasible and 
economical method for algae cultivation and biomass harvesting; and (iii) selection of 
suitable microalgae strain s. 
High concentration of nutrients such as ammonium can inhibit the growth of algae 
and lead to poor wastewater treatment effi ciency. According to Cai et al. ( 2013), 
nitrogen in the form of ammonium is the most preferred source for effective and rapid 
grow th of algae due to effective redox reaction during nitrogen assimilation and the less 
energy requirement for the reaction to occur.  
The selection of suitable algae for effective phycoremediation and CO 2 fixation is 
critical to the process development as mi croalgae cells have different tolerance to the 
range of pollutants, CO 2 concentration, and also the culture condition. According to 
Choul -gyun (2002), algal strain such Chlorella  kessleri  is capable of removing various 
concentration of nitrogen up to 1400 mg/L indicating that this algal strain has a high 
tolerance to nitrogen.  
Numerous studies have been conducted by researchers around the world on the 
application of algae for phycoremediation and biomass production for sustainable bio -
products production. W ith further research and development targeted at addressing 
some of the above -mentioned challenges, commercial -scale wastewater treatment using 
algae can be achieved.  
Wastewater treatment challenges using immobilized microalgae  
There are some challenges wi th the use of polymer immobilized microalgae systems 
according to Cai et al. (2013). These are (i) the capability of the system to remove 
pollutants present in wastewater effectively; (ii) cost of polymer and subsequent 
immobilization process; (iii) chemic al forces and interactions between the 
immobilization matrix and the cell wall may result in abiotic stresses (iv) limited 
diffusion of substrate or fluid like wastewater, metabolic products, oxygen and CO 2 to 
and from the cells in the polymeric matrix; (v ) sufficient light penetration into the 
polymer matrix containing algal cells; and (vi) the metabolism of microalgae is affected 
by its confinement in a limited space. However, these issues can be addressed by 
combining optimized immobilization matrices  with smart bioreactor designs.  
Conclusion  
Effective wastewater treatment is vital in order to improve the quality of wastewaters 
effluent which must be met the regulations standards set by local authorities before 
discharge. Thus, the use of suspended free -cells microalgae culture emerges as a viable 
option in future and can be explored to treat wastewaters containing nutrients sources 
with simultaneous CO 2 capture which are required for growth and support microalgae 
cultivation. For that reason, the use of b iochemical abilities of suspended free -cells Emparan et al.: Role  of phycoremediation for nutrient  remova l from wastewaters: a review

 2019 , ALÖK I Kft., Budapest, Hungary  microalgae culture is a popular approach to be used as a tertiary treatment in 
conventional wastewater treatment which can remove nutrient and BOD efficiently in 
the engineered system like high rate algal ponds.  Most recent studies have highlighted 
the various advantages of immobilized microalgae in carriers as compared to suspended 
free-cells microalgae culture for removal of nutrients, BOD and COD from 
wastewaters. For instance, application of immobilized algae  to treat wastewaters 
capable to reduce the cost of all process by circumventing the need for downstream 
processes using dewatering and harvesting methods to separate the biomass and treated 
effluent. In contrast, a very costly dewatering and harvesting me thods are required to 
obtain biomass derived from free -cells microalgae culture due to their dilute nature and 
small in size. Therefore, the immobilized microalgae in capsules not only ease the 
harvesting process but also increase the efficiency of wastewa ters treatment with CO 2 
sequestration and bioproduct generation derived from microalgae biomass. The removal 
of nutrient, BOD and COD from wastewaters using immobilized microalgae cells has 
been one of the major interesting research subjects carried out by  researchers globally 
due to its environment -friendly approach for sustainable development in the future.
