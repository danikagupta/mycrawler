  The objective of this work was to model and optimize the degradation of black azo 
dye Naphthol  Blue Black  (NBB) by the Fenton process (advanced oxidation) 
using a  minimum of experiments . A Plackett -Burman screening design was first 
applied to determine the main factors influencing the process. The dye 
discoloration efficiency gave a yield approximately equal to 97  % in the best 
conditions of several operating parameters used. The variance analysis (ANOVA)  
showed the effects of all different factors  and deduced  the most important  ones . 
Subsequently, a second quadratic design of experiments central composite  type 
(CCD) was applied using the response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize 
the most important parameters deduced by the first design cited above , in order to 
obtain the best performance of the discoloration  of NBB with this process. So from 
the contour plots and the response surfaces, the dis coloration yield enhanced to 
the maximum  and the optimization plot given by the Mnitab software , showed the 
following optimized parameters [NBB]=37.5 mg/L, [H 2O2]=66.5 mg/L, [Iron]=3.5 
mg/L and pH=3.4 for a yield of 100  % with a desirability of 1.0000.  At last, to 
confirm that the discoloration was due to the degradation of the dye, the chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) was studied and in the optimized conditions, the 
degradation reached 94.78  % after 120 min of treatment. The kinetics of the dye 
degradation  showed by the COD  abatement was relatively slow compared to the 
kinetics of the dye discoloration . Keywords:

1. Introduction  
 
 Most polluted effluents are very complex mixtures whose 
composition varies according to their industrial, agricultural or urban 
origin. Pollution assessment is therefore based on classifications 
according to the overall properties of the effluent. Pollution is defined 
as the introduction into a natural environment of foreign substances 
leading to its alteration. Harmful effects can occur at all levels 
(sanitary, ecological and economic) (Bouafia. 2010). Water pollution 
can be classified as flow pollution and sto ck pollution. The main 
difference between flow pollution and stock pollution is the persistence of environmental damage (Zhiyu. 2018).  The textile industry 
consumes 80  % of all synthetic dyes applied to color 40x106 tons of 
textile products annually. After  consumption, 15% of synthetic dyes 
are lost during manufacturing and processing. Due to their complex 
structures and synthetic origins, the effluents loaded with dyes are 
difficult to discolor; therefore , it becomes necessary to find alternative 
methods t o treat pollutants that are recalcitrant to conventional 
treatments.  
Azo dyes are the most preferred synthetic dyes for coating, 
leather dyeing, paper printing and textile dyeing because of their wide 
color spectrum, better firmness profile, simple applica tion, inexpensive

 synthesis, ease of structural modification, and ability to bind to most 
synthetic fibers (Wycliffe et al. 2019). In the modern textile industry, 
water management is particularly important. The amount of textile 
wastewater generated can re ach more than 300 L per kg of product 
(Kallia and Talvenma. 2000).  
The various conventional treatment technologies are unable to 
mineralize pollutants. Biological treatment technologies are also 
incapable for the degradation of pollutants because they are confined 
to easily biodegradable pollutants (Verma and Haritash. 2019). 
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are the most efficient 
technologies for treating pollutants because they not only degrade 
pollutants but are also responsible for their efficient mi neralization. 
Numerous studies carried out on a laboratory scale have clearly 
proven the efficiency of AOPs for the treatment of various effluents 
(Zaviska et al. 2009). Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are 
booming. These are methods based on the formati on of highly 
reactive chemical entities, this is the in situ formation of hydroxyl 
radicals OH• which have a higher oxidizing power than traditional 
oxidants such as Cl 2, ClO 2 or O 3. These radicals are capable of 
partially or totally mineralizing most orga nic compounds (Verma and 
Haritash. 2019; Chergui –Bouafia and Alloune. 2007), the products are 
simple organic compounds, CO 2 and H 2O (Yingying Long et al. 2019; 
Ribeiro et al. 2017). Fenton -type reactions, in which Fe2+ ions are 
replaced by different specie s, have recently attracted more attention 
because they reduce costs and improve efficiency (Ribeiro et al. 
2017).  
Experimental designs are essentially a planning strategy to obtain 
sound and adequate conclusions in an efficient and cost -effective 
manner. T he methodology of design of experiments is based on the 
fact that a properly organized experiment will often lead to simple 
analysis and statistics of the results (Iso 3534 -3. 2013).  
Experimental designs can be used in several scientific fields to 
study co mplex phenomena that require an enormous number of 
experiments to better understand how they work and optimize their 
performance (Benoist and Tourbier. 1994). This technique also allows 
us to obtain a maximum amount of information on the operating 
paramete rs and the influences of each of them as well as their 
interactions, which allows us to model them (Seong et al. 2 003; 
Coupez and Nouatin. 1990). The objective of this work was to model 
and optimize the degradation of black azo dye blue Naphthol (NBB) 
by the Fenton process advanced oxidation using a minimum of 
experiments. A Plackett -Burman screening design was first applied to 
determine the most important parameters influencing the process. 
Subsequently, a second quadratic design of experiments central 
composite type (CCD) was applied using the response surface 
methodology (RSM) to optimize these parameters in order to obtain 
the best performance of the discoloration of NBB with this process. To 
confirm the degradation of the dye, the chemical oxygen demand  
(COD) and its kinetics were studied in the optimized conditions.

hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium chloride (NaCl ) and c alcium chloride 
(CaCl 2) were obtained from Biochem C hemopharma  Com . 
 
2.2. Procedure  
 
The oxidation of naphthol blue black by the fenton process was 
realized using an experimental device which comprises a perfectly stirred reactor (batch reactor) with a capacity of 1000 mL. The 
temperature of the bath (distilled water) was stabilized at the  desired 
value by an immersion heater (tectron bio selecta thermostatted bath).    
The solution was continuously stirred by a mechanical agitator (Janke 
and KunKel RW 20). The agitator used was a propeller with four 
blades inclined at 45°. The pH of the so lution being studied was 
measured using a pH electrode (Eutech Instruments). The 
temperature was controlled using a temperature sensor connected to 
the pH meter (Eutech Instruments).  The oxidation of the dye was 
made in a discontinuous reactor with a volum e of 1000 mL . The 
volume of the solution studied for all experiments wa s 500 mL . This 
volume was made up of: volume of the dye + volume of FeSO 4 + 
volume of H 2O2 + volume of distilled  water = 500 mL . 
First, the dye solution was introduced in distilled wate r. Then , the 
acidify of the reaction medium was controlled with a few drops of 
concentrated acid to adjust the pH to the desired value (the volume of 
acid added is negligible). The temperature was set at the value 
chosen by the thermostat. The solution was  mixed for a few minutes 
to homogenize the medium, then a known volume of FeSO 4 solution 
was introduced and at the end, the H 2O2 solution was added to begin 
the reaction. In order to follow the oxidation kinetics, samples of 2 ml 
were taken at a specific t ime interval. The residual concentration of 
the dye in the solution at different times of sampling was determined 
by UV -visible spectroscopy. The concentration was determined from a 
calibration curve produced at pH  3 and a wavelength which 
corresponds to the maximum of absorbance (λ=619 nm), using a 
G705 Jenway spectrophotometer. The resolution of the wavelength 
and the bandwidth were 1nm and 0.5nm respectively, the cell was 
based on quartz and a thickness of 1cm.  The rate of degradation or 
abatement of th e color was calc ulated according to the Eq.  1.

3. Results and discussion  
3.1. Effects of the operating parameters  
3.1.1.  Plackett -Burman d esign  
 
   The Plackett -Burman plan is very frequently used to study the 
effects of operating parameters. It is a double factor (i .e. −1 and +1) 
which identifies significant variables for the degradation of NBB by 
selecting "n" variables in the experiments. From the results previously 
found,  nine parameters will be chosen in the present investigation, 
these parameters and their levels a re presented in table 1.  The  
experimental matrix and results according design of Plackett -Burman 
Design, are presented in T able 2. The main effect was calculated 
essentially as a difference between the measured mean of each 
variable performed at its high level (+1) and at its low level (−1). This 
design filtered variables based on a first -order model (Abdel -Fattah et 
al. 2002). This Plackett -Burman design is an essential tool for the 
selection of the effects of variables on performance of Fenton 
process. I t can reduce significantly the number of repetitive 
experiments to be carried out.  
 
3.1.2. Pareto diagram  
 
From Minitab software, a graph of Pareto effects was used to 
identify the important factors (Fig.  1). The graph shows the main effect 
estimates plotted against the horizontal axis and includes a vertical 
line to indicate the threshold of statistical significance p = 0.05 
(Bouziane et al. 2012). The Pareto diagram shows that the factors that 
have a major influence on the degradation of NBB are the pH 
(Kochany and Lipczynska -Kochany . 2009; Laiju et al. 2014; Alalm et 
al. 2014), the hydrogen peroxide [H 2O2] concentration ( Panda et al.  
2011; Nidheesh and Rajan . 2016) , the presence of chlorides (Tunçn 
et al.  2012; Grigorév et al. 1987), the nature of the acid used ( Bouasla 
et al.  2010; Pignatello . 1992)  and the temperature (Sun  et al. 2007). 
The other parameters have less influence.

3.1.3. Main effects  
 
The main effects graph is most useful when we have several 
factors. The change in the average level can be compared to deduce 
the factors that most influence the response . For a  factor with two 
levels, the response increases or decreases (positive or negative 
effect) from the lowest to the highest level, this difference is a “Main 
Effect” (Fig.  2). We talk about a significant effect if the probability is 
high (95.99 and 99.9  %) which means that t he effect is "real" 
(Bouziane  et al.  2012) . 
 
3.1.4. Analysis of variance  
 
A variance analysis (ANOVA) is an essential tool for determining 
the meaning of an effect or a mathematical model. The most 
significant factors can be determined using a statistical parameter 
which is the P -value (Table 3). This P -value was compared to another 
Alpha value that represents the risk of the model. Generally, Alpha 
equals 5% of the risk. These results show that the effects of the pH 
(Kavitha and Palanivelu. 2005; Kwon et a l. 1995; Nidheesh et al. 
2013) of the solution as well as the acid used to fix it (Hammami et al . 
2007; Gulkaya et al. 2006). The temperature (Ertugay and Acar. 
2017), the presence of the salts (Arslan -Alaton et al. 2009), the 
concentration of the peroxide  Xavier et al . 2015;  Dulman et al. 2012) 
and that of the dye (Randrianantoandro et al. 2014; Lounis et al. 
2016) are the most important and significant factors for NBB removal 
efficiency. The other factors are less important.

The Mathematical efficiency models as a function of coded and 
non-coded process parameters were determined with the regression 
coefficients in T able 3 (Eq.  2).  
Y = A 0 + A 1X1 + A 2X2 +……… +A nXn                                                                      (2) 
With, Y: the experimental response, X n: coded ( -1, +1) or non -coded 
variable,  An: estimate of the main effect of factor “n” for Y response. 
According to our resul ts represented in the previous T able 3, the 
modeling of the responses is written as follows:  
-For coded units   
Y = 38.545 -7.207 [NBB] + 6.011*T -3.069 *SS+ 10.627*[acid] - 
9.438*[CaCl 2]-4.208*[NaCl] + 2.914*[Iron] + 12.743*pH + 8.962*[H 2O2] 
The dye discoloration efficiency gave a yield approximately equal 
to 97% in the best conditions of several operating parameters used 
(Table 2, Runs 10,  11).The variance analysis (ANOVA) showed the 
effects of all different factors and deduced the most important ones.  
These results are in accordance with previous study that gave for a 
temperature of 25 ±2 °C and pH=3, hydrogen peroxide concentration 
equal to 50 mg/, s tirring speed equal to 250 rpm and an iron 
concentration of 3 mg/L, more than 98  % of the same dye [ NBB] = 30 
mg/L  has been eliminated (Meddah et al. 2021) . 
 
3.2.2. Modeling of the degradati on  
 
Likewise for this method the analysis of variance is calculated in 
order to compare the relative significance of each parameter and to 
develop a polynomial model for the objective response which is the 
performance of the degradation of NBB in our stud y. The results found 
are introduced in the following T able 6.  The model contains three 
linear effects, square and interaction effects. For the linearity which 
corresponds to the factors [iron], pH, [H 2O2] and [NBB], we note that 
the values of P are all greater than 0.05 except that for pH, so it can 
be seen that the latter has a significant effect on the yield of NBB 
degradation. The square effect is used to assess the existence of 
curvatures in the response surface. From the results in Table 5, it can 
be said that for the square effect only the pH and the concentration of 
hydrogen peroxide have a significant effect on the degradation 
performance of NBB. The variation in yield as a function of pH and the 
concentration of hydrogen peroxide will follow a cu rve instead of a 
straight line.  For interactions, we note the existence of three effects 
which influence the yield of the degradation of NBB. These 
interactions are between: the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and 
pH, the concentration of iron and pH, t he concentration of pollutant 
and pH. These i nteractions are shown in Figs.  3 and 4.  From the 
different values of the coefficients determined for each operating 
parameter taken alone or combined (Table 5), we were able to write 
the equation of the yield model in its non coded unit:  
Y = 88.6413 + 0.7457 * [H 2O2] - 9.0275 * [iron] + 16.2624 * pH - 
1.0096 * [NBB] - 0.0095 * [H 2O2] * [H 2O2] + 2. 2671 * [iron] * [iron] - 
2.837 * pH * pH + 0.0165 * [NBB] * [NBB] - 0.0242 * [H 2O2] * iron - 
0.0294 * [H 2O2] * pH +  0. 0084 * [H 2O2] * [NBB] - 0.3938 * [iron] * pH -
0.0232 * [iron] * [NBB] - 0.0089 * pH * [NBB]  
The last column of Table 4 presents   the theoretical yield given by the 
model. Then, this makes it possible to calculate R2 and adjusted R2. Finally, since there are several insignificant terms, the values of R2 
and adjusted R2 which are 53.47  % and 41.06  % respectively, seem to 
be just acceptable. If we remove the insignificant terms, the values of 
R2 and adjusted R2 will become too low. This is why the mode l must 
consider all of its terms.  
 
3.2.3. Response surface m ethodology  
 
In order to determine the operating conditions giving degradation 
yield greater than 90  %, we used the graphic method called the 
contour method. These contours or isoresponse surfaces are plotted 
as a function of two operating parameters. The surface diagram which 
is a three -dimensional graphical grid, represents the functional 
relationship between the response and the experimental factors. To 
draw these contours, we proceeded as follow s: for each pair of 
operating parameters; for example [H 2O2] * pH, we have drawn three 
graphs. The first graph is plotted as a function of [H 2O2] * pH and the 
other parameters such as the concentration of the dye [NBB], the 
concentration of hydrogen peroxi de [H 2O2]. Their value is fixed at a 
level +1 or maximum value (Fig. 5).The second graph; the values of 
the other parameters are fixed at the mean level 0. The third graph the 
values of the other parameters are fixed at the minimum level or less 
than -1. Plotting the graphs in this way allows us to scan fairly broadly 
for each operating parameter. On the other hand, effects of iron and 
NBB are less important; indeed, the yield is between 95 and 100% in 
the intervals studied (Fig.  6).

3.2.4. Optimization of the degradation parameters  
 
The advantage of the optimization is to have a maximum yield for 
the degradation of NBB. From the four factors studied, we seek to find 
an optimal interval for which the yield will be at its maximum. For this, 
the optimization is applied under constraint. We choose different 
starting points in the dialog window area (optimized response) and a 
constraint on the targeted response. The r esults of the optimization 
indicate the optimal values for each factor as well as the optimal value 
of the degradation yield of the NBB.  Fig. 7 shows an optimization 
under the following constraints; the target yield is 100.0 % with a 
desirability of 1.00 00. Results for a degradation yield of 100  % are as 
following; for a  [NBB] 0=37.5 mg/ L,  it is necessary that [H 2O2]=66 mg / 
L, pH = 3.4 and [iron]=3.5 mg/L.  
 
3.2.5. Chemical oxygen demand (COD)  
 
The results represented in figure 8 clearly show that the use  of the 
Fenton process with the optimum parameters for the degradation of 
NBB leads to a 94.78  % reduction in COD after 120 min of treatment. 
The kinetics of COD abatement is relatively slow compared to the 
kinetics of discoloration ; this can be explained by the formation of 
intermediate products which require more time for them to be 
oxidized. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of the 
Fenton process to degrade a wide variety of azo dyes (Coupez and 
Nouatin.  1990 ; Lounis e al. 2016) .

4. Conclusion s 
 
In this work we have studied the influence of operating parameters 
on the Fenton process advanced oxidation efficiency of a solution 
contaminated by an azo dye which is Naphthol Blue Black. A Plackett -
Burman screening design was first applied to determine the main 
factors influencing the process. The dye discoloration efficiency gave 
a yield approximately equal to 97% in the best conditions of nine 
operating parameters used. The variance anal ysis showed the effects 
of all these different factors and were deduced the most important 
ones which will be optimized with a second -order experimental 
design. However; a second quadratic design of experiments central 
composite type was applied using the response surface methodology to optimize the parameters deduced by the first design cited above, in 
order to obtain the best performance of the discoloration of NBB with 
this process. So from the contour plots and the response surfaces, the 
discoloration y ield enhanced to the maximum and the optimization plot 
given by the Mnitab software, showed the following optimized 
parameters [NBB]=37.5 mg/L, [H 2O2]=66.5 mg/L, [Iron]=3.5 mg/L and 
pH=3.4 for a yield of 100% with a desirability of 1.0000. The 
discoloratio n was due to the degradation of the dye, indeed the 
chemical oxygen demand showed that the degradation reached 
94.78% after 120 min of treatment. The kinetics of the dye 
degradation was relatively slow compared to the kinetics of the dye 
discoloration.
