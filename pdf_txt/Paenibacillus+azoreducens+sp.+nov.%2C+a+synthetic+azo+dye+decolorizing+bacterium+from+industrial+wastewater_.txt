In this study, spore-forming bacteria isolated from saccharified rice were selected 
for producing acetic acid. From the screening of 15 strains, P8 strain was chosen 
as a candidate. The strain was identified as Paenibacillus azoreducens  by 16S 
rRNA analysis (99.85% similarity with P. azoreducens  CM1T). Acetic acid is the main 
component of vinegar but also an industrial commodity produced by chemical 
synthesis. Sustainable routes for obtaining acetic acid are of great interest for 
decreasing the environmental impact generated by chemical syntheses. Biological 
acetic acid production is effective for vinegar production by acetic acid bacteria, 
but it cannot economically compete with the chemical synthesis for producing it 
as a pure commodity. Considering the need to improve the yield of pure acetic 
acid produced by microbial conversions, in this study, P8 strain was chosen for 
designing processes in different fermentation conditions. Tests were conducted 
in single and semi-continuous systems, using rice wine as substrate. Acetic acid 
produced by P8 strain was compared with that of Acetobacter pasteurianus  
(UMCC 2951), a strain known for producing acetic acid from rice wine. Even 
though the fermentation performances of P. azoreducens  P8 were slightly lower 
than those of acetic acid bacteria usually used for vinegar production, results 
highlight its suitability for producing acetic acid. The final acetic acid produced 
by P. azoreducens  P8 was 73 g/L, in a single stage fermentation, without losses. 
In nine cycles of semi-continuous regime the average of acetification rate was 
0.814 (g/L/days). Two main attributes of P. azoreducens  P8 are of relevance for 
producing acetic acid, namely the ability to grow at temperature higher (+ 37 °C), 
than mesophilic acetic acid bacteria, and the absence of cytoplasmic assimilation 
of acetic acid. These features allow to design multiple strains cultures, in which P. 
azoreducens  can acts as a helper strain. Based on our results, the new isolate P. 
azoreducens  P8 can be propagated in fermenting broths for boosting acetic acid 
production, under the selected conditions, and used in combination with acetic 
acid bacteria to produce biological acetic acid, as a non-food grade commodity.

Frontiers in Microbiology 02 frontiersin.orgIntroduction
Spore-forming bacteria are receiving great attention for their 
biotechnological potential in different industrial areas and 
sustainable productions. Their ability to survive in different 
environments at high physiological stresses, make them suitable 
for several bioprocesses, leading to high production of useful 
bio-compounds ( Lal and Tabacchioni, 2009 ; Grady et al., 2016 ; 
Kaziūnienė et al., 2022 ).
Spore-forming bacteria were longed classified into two orders 
represented by Bacillales  and Clostridiales  (Abecasis et al., 2013 ). 
More recently, the new order Thermoanaerobacterales  was 
proposed ( Wiegel, 2015 ). Food spoilage Bacillales  members 
belong to the genera of Bacillus , Geobacillus , Anoxybacillus , 
Alicyclobacillus  and Paenibacillus  (Mcclure, 2006 ).
Among these genera, Paenibacillus  includes Gram-positive or 
variable, spore-forming bacteria, rod-shaped, aerobic or facultative 
anaerobic. Species belonging to Paenibacillus  were reported to 
be ubiquitous, widely isolated from various environment, as cow 
feces ( Velazquez et al., 2004 ), plant roots and food ( Berge et al., 
2002 ), warm springs ( Chou et al., 2007 ), raw and heat-treated milk 
(Scheldeman et al., 2004 ), paper mill white water ( Chiellini et al., 
2014 ), blood cultures ( Roux and Raoult, 2004 ) and traditional 
Chinese vinegar produced from cereals ( Li et  al., 2016 ). Many 
species of Paenibacillus  produce antimicrobial compounds that are 
useful in medicine or as pesticides, and many yield enzymes that 
could be  utilized for bioremediation or to produce valuable 
chemicals ( Grady et al., 2016 ; da Costa et al., 2022 ). Due to their 
antibacterial activity, Paenibacillus  species were also reported to 
be suitable for foods and beverages production ( Marwoto et al., 
2004 ; Grady et al., 2016 ; Li et al., 2016 ). Among recognized species, 
Paenibacillus azoreducens , a facultative anaerobic bacterium able 
to decolorize azo dyes, grows in a temperature range between 10 °C 
and 50 °C, with optimal growth at 37 °C and can produces acids 
from sugars ( Meehan et al., 2001 ).
Chemically synthesized acetic acid and its derivates are 
commodities that have become a major feedstock for the 
United States and worldwide chemical industry. Petrochemically 
produced acetic acid reached a level of 4.68 × 109 lbs./year in the 
United States by 1995 and was ranked 35th in abundance of all 
chemicals produced ( Kirschner, 1996 ). Worldwide production in 
1998 was estimated at 11.9 × 109 lbs./year ( Layman, 1998 ). From 
more recent data, the global demand for virgin acetic acid is 
estimated to be 16.1 million tons in 2020, and it is expected to 
reach 19.6 million tons by 2027 ( Martín-Espejo et  al., 2022 ). 
Although many research efforts, bioderived acetic acid does not 
compete economically with acetic acid produced by chemical 
synthesis. The chemical process, although is expensive and 
depends on non-renewable petroleum for raw materials, takes 
advantage of an initially high acetic acid concentration (35%–
45%) and high production yield. Instead, acetic acid produced by 
microbial processes, via ethanol oxidation by acetic acid bacteria 
(AAB) or by anaerobic fermentation, can be  obtained from a 
number of renewable raw materials, but the major disadvantage is the cost of recovery of low concentrations of acetic acid (4%–12%) 
from the fermentation broths. Moreover, during AAB 
fermentation other compounds, such as bacterial cellulose and 
gluconic acid can be formed, which could affect the final acetic 
acid content ( La China et al., 2021 ; He et al., 2022 ). On the other 
hands, considering the use of vinegar in non-food productions, 
for instance, it can be  added to correct pH in detergents 
preparations, together with its derivatives, acetic acid is applied in 
pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, solvents, textiles, heat transfer 
liquids, neutralizer, fungicide and de-icers productions ( Kersters 
et al., 2006 ). Considering the need of the biotechnology industry 
in producing compounds, such as organic acid by microbial 
conversions, the production of acetic acid, traditionally associated 
to vinegar production by AAB ( La China et  al., 2018 ), could 
be improved in terms of yield. Moreover, due to the global demand 
for acetic acid, sustainable routes for obtaining it are an open 
challenge, as an alternative to the chemical synthesis.
In this study, we present a new strain (P8) belonging to the 
genus Paenibacillus  isolated from upland rice during the 
saccharification process, identified as P . azoreducens  species. Given 
the continuous increasing interest in members belonging to this 
genus, the phenotypic traits of this new strain were studied, 
including the ability to produce acetic acid and other volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs). The acetic acid production by P . azoreducens  
(P8 strain) was compared with that of Acetobacter pasteurianus  
UMCC 2951, an AAB strain previously isolated from rotten 
pineapple pomace and studied for its attitude in performing ethanol 
oxidation into acetic acid. The output of this study can be further 
exploited for design a multiple microbial culture composed by the 
two strains aimed at producing bioderived acetic acid.
Materials and methods
Strains isolation and cultivation 
conditions
Isolation of spore-forming bacteria was conducted from 30 
samples of contaminated or rotten saccharified rice. Samples were 
diluted in peptone water (1% w/v) and aliquots (1 ml) were plated 
in sterile Paenibacillus -basal agar medium consisting of (g/L of 
water) glucose 20, yeast extract 5, tryptone 5, (NH 4)2HPO 4 0.5, 
MgSO 4.7H 2O 0.25, CaCO 3 10 and agar 15 (modified from 
Nakashimada et  al., 1998 ). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 
3–5 days, under aerobic conditions. Then, single colonies were 
selected based on the clear halo formed on the agar medium due to 
acid production. Selected colonies were picked up and sub-cultured 
on the isolation medium until pure cultures were obtained. All 
isolates were checked for spore production by spore staining test, 
according to the procedure reported by Oktari et al. (2017) . Briefly, 
samples of cell culture were stained by using Malachite Green 
solution of 5 and 0.5% Safranin. After first staining with Malachite 
Green by a moist heating process for 10 min, the cell culture was 
washed with water and then covered with paint Safranin which Krusong et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.991688
Frontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.orgresults in the green coloring on the spores, as well as red in the 
vegetative cells. The spore former-acid producing strains were 
named as “P” followed by a progressive number and preserved in 
Paenibacillus -basal medium agar slant, at 4 °C.
Selection of spore former-acid 
producing bacteria and acetic acid 
production tests
Upland rice vinegar, containing 80 g/L of acetic acid was 
obtained from the Laboratory of Fermentation Technology, King 
Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Thailand. It was 
used as a substrate in acetification medium. Meanwhile, upland 
rice wine with an ethanol content of 90 ± 0.2 g/L and titratable 
acidity of 1.8 ± 0.2 g/L was also used in the adjustment of ethanol 
in acetification medium. All spore former-acid producing strains 
were cultivated in acetification medium consisting of (g/L of 
water) glucose 50, yeast extract 5, MgSO 4.7H 2O 0.2 and 
(NH 4)2HPO 4 0.5 which was adjusted to a total concentration (TC; 
a parameter which expresses the maximal concentration of acetic 
acid that can be obtained in a complete fermentation) of 80 g/L by 
using upland rice wine and vinegar in a 1 l Duran bottle (working 
volume 500 ml), as described by Krusong et al. (2014 , 2015) . The 
aeration was controlled at a constant rate of 4 l/min.
Upland rice vinegar and wine were used for adjustment of 
acetic acid and ethanol contents in the medium of acetification 
process by P8 and A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 strains, 
respectively. A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 strain was previously 
adapted to high acetic acid concentration at 30 ± 1°C by stepwise 
scaling up, starting from 10 g/L to 65 ± 1 g/L of acetic acid, over a 
six-year period ( Krusong and Tantratian, 2014 ; Pothimon et al., 
2020 ). The broth culture from A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 strain 
was prepared by using the following medium (g/L of water): 
glucose 50, yeast extract 5, MgSO 4.7H 2O 0.2 and (NH 4)2HPO 4 0.5, 
under aeration (4.5 L/min), for 7 days at 30 ± 1°C (Krusong et al., 
2007 ). According to the high initial acetic acid concentration 
(HAA i) process previously set up ( Krusong et  al., 2014 ), the 
acetification medium (g/L of water: glucose 50, yeast extract 5, 
MgSO 4.7H 2O 0.2 and (NH 4)2HPO 4 0.5) was standardized to a total 
concentration of 80 g/L, by adjusting the ethanol and acetic acid 
contents to 35 ± 1 g/L and 45 ± 1 g/L, respectively.
16S rRNA gene sequencing and 
phylogenetic analysis
Strain identity was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 
Genomic DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of 16S 
rRNA gene was performed by Macrogen Inc. company, according 
to their protocols. Then, the sequence was trimmed, removing low 
quality bases, using Phred v 0.071220.c and assembled using 
Pharp v 1.090518 ( Ewing and Green, 1998 ). The dataset was 
structured by downloading a total of 20 16S rRNA sequences of Paenibacillus  strains from NCBI 16S rRNA database, selecting 
sequencing of strains isolated from food matrices. The 16S rRNA 
sequences were aligned using Muscle v3.8.31 ( Edgar, 2004 ). 
Resulting alignment was imported in MegaX ( Kumar et al., 2018 ) 
and trimmed in to obtain sequences with the same length. 
Trimmed alignment was used to generate a maximum-likelihood 
(ML) phylogenetic tree, applying the Tamura-Nei evolutionary 
model ( Tamura and Nei, 1993 ), setting a discrete gamma 
distribution to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. 
The ML phylogenetic tree was computed using 1,000 replicates. 
The alignment was also used to calculate the phylogenetic distant 
matrix. In addition, the nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene is 
available at GenBank, under the accession number OP353700.1.
Acetification performance by single and 
semi-continuous processes
The acetification conditions (single stage) for both P8 and 
A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 strains were setup in a 100 L internal 
Venturi injector bioreactor (as reported in our previous study; 
Krusong et  al., 2015 ), which comprised a stainless-steel tank 
1.00 m high and 0.40 m internal diameter that had a maximum 
working volume of 75 l. The medium (consisting of (g/L of water): 
glucose 50, yeast extract 5, MgSO 4.7H 2O 0.2 and (NH 4)2HPO 4 0.5 
which was adjusted to a TC of 80 g/L by using upland rice wine 
and vinegar) was recycled using a centrifugal pump (Grundfos 
Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand), filtered and entrained. Well-compressed 
air was introduced into the medium at the injector nozzle (Mazzei 
Injector Com., LLC, Bakersfield, CA, USA) at 7.25–14.5 psi 
creating a plentiful amount of fine air bubbles in the bioreactor. 
The temperature of the medium was controlled at 30 °C by cooling 
unit with Thermocouple Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) 
PT100 RTD (Omega Engineering Inc., Connecticut, USA).
The startup phase was conducted with 25 L of working volume 
of the bioreactor at 7.25 psi of air ( Krusong et al., 2015 ). The end 
of this phase occurred when the ethanol content reached 5 g/L or 
less ( Fregapane et  al., 2001 ; de Ory et  al., 2004 ). Then, the 
fermentation phase was started by adding a volume of fresh 
medium to make up the medium volume to 75 L at 14.5 psi of air 
(Krusong et al., 2015 ), fixing TC at 80 ± 1 g/L. The overoxidation 
of acetic acid was tested after the ethanol content reached 0 g/L, by 
extending acetification period under the same rate of aeration 
supply. Samples were collected at the end of the operational phase.
The semi-continuous acetification by P8 strain under HAA i 
conditions was conducted fixing TC at 80 g/L (consisting of 45 g/L 
acetic acid and 35 g/L ethanol) in the 100 l internal Venturi injector 
bioreactor. The temperature was controlled at 30 °C. Acetification 
rate (ETA), which measures the rate of acetic acid production 
(difference between the final and initial acidity during each 
acetification cycle) and biotransformation yield (percentage of 
ethanol that is converted to acetic acid; Fregapane et al., 2001 ; de 
Ory et al., 2004 ; Krusong et al., 2015 ) were used as indicators of 
process effectiveness. The means of the calculated values of these Krusong et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.991688

differences among the samples in acetic acid production were 
represented by different letters.two parameters were recorded for each cycle, along with the cell 
biomass in forms of cell dried weight (CDW) values.
Analytical determinations
Acetic acid and ethanol content during acetification was 
measured using GC–MS (Thermo Scientific Trace GC Ultra coupled 
to an ISQ Single Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The DB-wax column 
(length 30 m, Pressure 6.76 psi, Flow 1.0 ml/min) was used with an 
inlet temperature of 250 °C and with splitless injection of 75 ml/min. 
Helium gas was employed as the carrier at 1.2 ml/min. Samples were 
introduced and maintained at 40 °C for 5 min. The temperature 
increment was 5 °C/min to 120 °C for acetic acid or 5 °C/min to 90 °C 
for ethanol, and this was then held constant for 10 min and 3 min, 
respectively. Identification of acetic acid or ethanol was based on 
retention times compared with the Wiley, 275.L data library for the 
GC–MS system. Standard curve of acetic acid and ethanol was 
carried out and used for concentration evaluation. The cell biomass 
in terms of CDW in each acetification cycle was measured from the 
absorbance at 660 nm with a spectrophotometer (GENESYS 10VIS). 
The sample was diluted to an OD660nm value between 0.3 and 0.8 
and converted to CDW through a linear correlation standard curve 
of P . azoreducens,  one DO660 was almost equivalent to 0.3 g/L. The 
resulting CDW was determined in the same way as that in the 
fermentation medium ( Krusong and Tantratian, 2014 ).
The volatile compounds (VOCs) produced by P8 and 
A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 strains were removed by solid phase 
micro-extraction (SPME; modified from Vas and Vékey, 2004 ) and 
measured using GC–MS. First, 5 ml of the sample was placed in a 
25 ml glass bottle leaving a 20 ml headspace volume. Then, 3 g of solid 
NaCl was added and the bottle was sealed with a septum cap 
(Stableflex PDMS/DVB for SPME fiber size 60 μm; Supelco Inc., 
Bellefonte, PA, USA). After 60 min at 37 °C, to allow for extraction, 
the components were analyzed using GC–MS (as above). Samples 
were introduced and maintained at 40 °C for 5 min. The temperature 
increment was 5 °C/min to 230 °C and was then held constant for 
5 min. For MS determination, an electron ionization mode was 
employed with ion source temperature of 230 °C, scan mass range of 
35–300 amu, and MS transfer line at 240 °C with 0 min solvent delay 
time. Identification of the volatile components was based on retention 
times and mass spectra fragmentation patterns and qualitatively 
compared with the Wiley, 275.L data library for the GC–MS system.
Statistical analyses
Measurements were replicated three times and their means 
are reported together with appropriate standard deviations 
(±standard deviation). The statistical significance was determined 
using one-way ANOV A and differences among samples were 
assessed using Tukey post-hoc  test, when required. All statistical 
tests were performed using R, Version 4.1.0.Results and discussion
Isolation and selection of spore 
former-acid producing bacteria from 
saccharified rice
In this study, 60 isolates were collected from a total of 30 
samples of contaminated saccharified rice. Fifteen strains (labeled 
from P1 to P15) produced both spores and a clear halo area around 
the colony on Paenibacillus -basal agar medium supplemented with 
CaCO 3, indicating that they were acid producers. To evaluate the 
acetic acid ability of the spore forming strains, tests were conducted 
in Duran bottles for 30 days, at 30 ± 2°C; TC: 80 g/L (45 g/L acetic 
acid and 35 g/L ethanol, respectively), and aeration at 4 l/min, 
according to the method described by Krusong et al., 2015 . All the 
strains produced acetic acid in the range between 45–55 g/L, except 
for strain P8, which produced a higher acetic acid amount (56 g/L; 
Figure 1 ). Given the highest amount of acetic acid by P8 strain, it 
was selected for further investigation.
Species level identification of P8 strain
An almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequence (1,515 bp) from 
gDNA of P8 strain was determined. Sequences, from the multiple 
alignment of the 20 sequences retrieved from NCBI and P8 16S 
rRNA sequence were trimmed to the same length, reducing the total 
sequence length to 1,354. The ML phylogenetic tree obtained 
(Figure 2 ) showed the presence of three major clades. 16S rRNA 
sequence of P8 strain had highest similarity (99.85%) with 
P . azoreducens  CM1T. The bootstrap value of 100, highlights the 
strength of the analysis. The distant matrix (Supplementary material) 
computed, excluding the outgroup represented by Lactobacillus  Krusong et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.991688
Frontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.orgstrains, showed that the distant index of both P8 and P . azoreducens  
CM1T was 0.145%, meaning the sequence similarity was 99.85%. 
The average distant values among overall strains were calculated 
resulting in 5.44%. Given the high similarity percentage compared 
with the average distance calculated for all 21 strains, it can 
be assumed that P8 is a new strain of P . azoreducens  species. Bacteria 
belonging to Paenibacillus  are widely distributed in natural matrices, 
especially in soil and plant roots ( Grady et al., 2016 ). P . azoreduncens  
strains were isolated from textile wastewater and were recognized as 
synthetic azo dye producers ( Meehan et al., 2001 ).
Performance of Paenibacillus 
azoreducens  P8 and Acetobacter 
pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 in producing 
acetic acid
The production of acetic acid of P . azoreducens  P8 strain in 
scaling up conditions was first tested in Venturi injector bioreactor 
and results compared with those obtained from A. pasteurianus  
UMCC 2951, which is a well described strain for its aptitude to 
produce acetic acid under environmental stressors, like high 
temperature and HAA i (Krusong and Tantratian, 2014 ; Pothimon 
et al., 2020 ). The results obtained showed that P . azoreducens  P8 strain was able to start ethanol oxidization after 2 weeks of 
cultivation ( Figure 3A ). During the second cycle, at 6 weeks, the 
ethanol oxidation started after 1 week of the fermentation process. 
Finally, after 12 days of fermentation, the ethanol was completely 
oxidized, reaching a final acetic acid content of 73 g/L. Considering 
A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951, our data highlighted that the trends 
were almost the same comparing to P8 strain ( Figure 3B ). About the 
fermentation process for A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951, the start-up 
period was shorter. Indeed, the ethanol fermentation started after 1 
day of cultivation and the first cycle finished at day 6. The second 
cycle was started on day 6 and after 4 days the ethanol was 
completely oxidized into acetic acid. However, it could be noticed 
that the same characteristics of acetification profile consisting of 
start-up and operational phases of both cultures were similar, but 
only difference in acetification period was observed. The difference 
in acetic acid production by P . azoreducens  P8 and A. pasteurianus  
UMCC 2951 can be explained considering the different cultivation 
history of the two strains. A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 was 
subjected to a selective pressure along 6 years of adaptation at high 
acetic acid content and high temperature ( Pothimon et al., 2020 ). 
Instead, P8 is a new isolated strain. The propagation of microbial 
cultures under selective pressure, is well known in the case of AAB 
generally used for industrial vinegar production, where cultures 
acquire resistance to environmental stressors if continuously

Semi-continuous acetification by 
Paenibacillus azoreducens  P8
To evaluate large scale production of acetic acid by 
P . azoreducens  P8, a semi-continuous process, in a 100 L internal 
Venturi injector bioreactor, was developed. As reported by many 
studies the biological process of vinegar fermentation can be considered completed when the amount of residual ethanol 
is around or below 5 g/L ( Ebner et al., 1996 ; Ndoye et al., 2007 ; 
Gullo et al., 2014 ; Krusong et al., 2015 ). In this study, between 
each cycle, a 40% of the total volume was replaced by fresh 
medium and, subsequently, the new cycle was started. A total of 
nine cycles were performed in which P . azoreducens  P8 was 
continuously under stressors, like high acetic acid and ethanol. 
Full data are reported in Table 1 . In the startup phase and the 
first cycle, the ETA values (0.214 g/L/d and 0.671 g/L/d, 
respectively) were low, showing an initial adaptation stage of the 
culture to fermentation. This consideration is supported by the 
AB

Frontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.orgCDW values, showing that the weight of the dried cell was 0.026 
at the start-up phase and 0.029 at cycle 1. However, during the 
first cycle, the ETA value reached 0.671 g/L/d, indicating the 
fermentation start. From cycle 2 until the end of the process, the 
amount of acetic acid produced was considerable (about 30 g/L 
for each cycle) except for cycles 6 and 7  in which a slight 
decrease was observed (24 ± 0.3 g/L and 25 ± 0.3 g/L, 
respectively). This reduction can be due to the oscillation of the 
cell viability (CDW 0.027 in the cycle 6 and 0.031 in the cycle 
7), that generally might occur ( Maestre et al., 2008 ) considering 
the toxic effect of acetic acid on cells ( Saeki et al., 1997 ; Lu et al., 
1999 ; Baena-Ruano et al., 2010 ; Song et al., 2022 ). The ETA and 
the CDW values were consistently with the acetic acid 
production trend. The biotransformation percentage, excluding 
the startup phase, ranged from 75% up to 97% (90.1% as 
average). Comparing P . azoreducens  P8 with A. pasteurianus  
UMCC 2951, previously tested ( Pothimon et  al., 2020 ), the 
average of acetic acid production was slightly reduced (30.11 g/L 
on average of acetic acid produced by P8; 52 g/L on average of 
A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951). Compared to others AAB used 
in semi-continuous processes, the ETA values resulted to be low, 
such as 2.2 + 0.06 g/L/d by an industrial culture of vinegar 
(Fregapane et al., 2001 ); 12 g/L/d by A. senegalensis  (CWBI-
B418T) (Ndoye et al., 2007 ) and 5 g/L/h A. pasteurianus  (Mounir 
et al., 2018 ). These differences can be correlated to the handling 
of cultures, especially to the different cultivation time under 
selective pressure, as previously discussed (Paragraph 3.3). Thus, 
the new isolate P . azoreducens  P8, which showed appreciable 
aptitude to produce acetic acid, can be considered a suitable 
candidate for industrial acetic acid production. It is reasonable 
to suppose that longer adaptation cycles to fermentation 
conditions could further enhance the amount of acetic 
acid produced.
At current this strategy is not aimed at producing food grade 
acetic acid because the absence of deep information on the use of 
Paenibacillus  strains in food, but it can be of great relevance to 
produce biological acetic acid for non-food uses.
Main advantages of the strategy proposed in this study arise 
at least from two technological traits that can affect the biological 
production of acetic acid. AAB have optimal temperature growth 
of 28–30 °C and in absence of thermotolerant strains, the oxidation 
of ethanol into acetic acid could be  stopped because of the 
exergonic nature of the reaction ( Ebner et al., 1996 ; Gullo et al., 
2016 ). Moreover, AAB could oxidize acetic acid when ethanol is 
depleted and can produce bacterial cellulose, which is undesired 
during organic acid production ( La China et  al., 2018 ). If the 
process is aimed at producing acetic acid at higher rate than 
vinegar, a multiple culture of AAB and other bacteria, which can 
growth at higher temperature and that do not oxidize acetic acid 
could be an innovative introduction for the biological production 
of acetic acid. Based on these considerations P . azoreducens  P8 can 
be considered a helper strain in producing acetic acid in a multiple 
starter, as a booster of the fermentation, contributing to maintain 
the acetic acid level, avoiding losses during processes.Volatile compounds produced by 
Paenibacillus azoreducens  P8 and 
Acetobacter pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 
strains, under HAA i conditions
In this study, to have more knowledge on microbial 
compounds of industrial interest from P . azoreducens  P8 and 
A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951, VOCs composition was determined. 
The VOCs composition of rice wine, which was the alcoholic 
substrate used to produce acetic acid, is highly complex and 
depends on many factors, including the microbial composition of 
the starter and the fermentation practices. Main VOCs categories, 
previously described, belong to esters, alcohols, amino acids, and 
organic acids ( Zhang et al., 2022 ).
The VOCs distribution in terms of chemical families was 
found to be different among the fermented products obtained by 
P . azoreducens  P8 and A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951, respectively 
(Figure  4A ). A total of 40 and 37 VOCs were found in 
P . azoreducens  P8 and A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 fermented 
products, respectively. Among all the identified VOCs, 20 were 
produced by both culture ( Table 2 ). The most abundant VOCs 
belonged to esters (29.46% for P8 and 14.62% for UMCC 2951) 
and acids (15.54% for P8 and 12.14 for UMCC 2951; Figure 4B ). 
VOCs in these chemical families were represented by products 
or intermediates of the oxidation of ethanol into acetic acid. In 
the case of esters, the most abundant VOC was ethyl acetate for 
both culture strains, whereas for acids, the most abundant VOC 
was acetic acid. Other VOCs species belong to these chemical 
families were intermediates of the fermentation process (e.g., 
2-methyl propanoic acid or pentanoic acid) detected in different 
amount and different chemical species. Regarding other 
abundant chemical families, alcohols and aldehydes were the 
most abundant. In detail, we  observed the same number of 
species of alcohols in both cultures (6 per each sample), but 
considering the total percentage, alcohols were most abundant 
in A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 (8.41%) culture compared to 
P . azoreducens  P8 (3.72%). In the case of aldehydes, the number 
of VOCs were different (3 for P8 and 5 for A. pasteurianus  
UMCC 2951, while the total percentage was higher in P8 culture 
(8.1%) compared to A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951 (4.46%). 
Among these chemical families, the two samples were 
characterized by a different amount of VOCs belonging to acids 
and esters. In particular, in P . azoreducens  P8 culture the number 
of acids and esters was higher than in A. pasteurianus  UMCC 
2951 culture. Also, ethers were found to be abundant in both 
samples, (9.8% of the total in P8 and 2.98% in UMCC 2951; 
Figure 4B ). In addition to the chemical families discussed, other 
VOCs belong to different chemical families were detected in 
small amount. Phenols and benzene derivatives were detected in 
both samples ( Figure 4A ). Some chemical species were detected 
just in one sample. For example, one amide (3-amino-4,5,6-
trimethyl-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid tert-
butylamide) and one pyrazine (methyl-pyrazine) were produced 
by P . azoreducens  P8. The VOC analysis performed in this study Krusong et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.991688

Conclusion
In study we screened and characterized a new spore-former 
acid producing bacterium, identified as P . azoreducens , strain P8. 
The strain was tested for the ability of producing acetic acid 
following industrial vinegar technology. The results obtained 
testing P . azoreducens  P8 highlight the abilities of the strain in 
acetification process, even though the fermentation performances 
were slightly lower than the AAB usually used at industrial scale. 
P . azoreducens  P8 possessed ethanol and acidity tolerances, 
developed during the early stages of HAA i process (start up and 
the cycle 1). Comparing the fermentation activities of 
P . azoreducens  P8 with A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951, the amount 
of acetic acid obtained was relatively high. Regarding the VOCs 
analysis, some of them were shared among the fermented broth 
by the P . azoreducens  P8 and A. pasteurianus  UMCC 2951. Given 
the advantages of the application in the fermentation processes at 
industrial of spore-forming bacteria, we  can confirm that 
P . azoreducens  P8, after future analysis to better clarify its genomic 
and phenotypic features, could be  suitable for fermentation 
processes. Based on the output of this study, it is reasonable to 
suppose its use in single or multiple cultures to improve the 
stability and the production yield of acetic acid by 
biological processes.
