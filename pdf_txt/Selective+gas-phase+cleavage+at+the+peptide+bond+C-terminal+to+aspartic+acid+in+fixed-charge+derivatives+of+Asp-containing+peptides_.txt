This study focuses on the molecular level interpretation
of the selective gas-phase cleavage at aspartic acid resi-dues (Asp) in protonated peptides. A O
3P+CH2C(dO)-
group ( O)2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl) is attached to the
N-terminal nitrogen of the selected peptides LDIFSDF andLDIFSDFR, via solid-phase synthesis, to ªmimicº thetightly held charge of a protonated arginine (Arg) residue.Collision-induced dissociation in a quadrupole ion trapinstrument and surface-induced dissociation in a dualquadrupole instrument were performed for electrospray-generated ions of the fixed-charge peptide derivatives.Selective cleavages at Asp -Xxx are observed for those
ions with charge provided only by the fixed charge or forthose with a fixed charge and one Arg plus one addedproton. This supports a previously proposed mechanismwhich suggests that the cleavages at Asp -Xxx, initiated
by the acidic hydrogen of the Asp residue, becomesignificant when ionizing protons are strongly bound byArg in the protonated peptides. It is clear that the fixedcharge is indeed serving as a ªmimicº of protonated Argand that a protonated Arg side chain is not required tointeract with the Asp to induce cleavage at Asp -Xxx.
When the number of protons exceeds the number of Argin a peptide containing Arg and Asp, nonselective cleav-ages occur. The fragmentation efficiency of the peptidesis consistent with the idea that these nonselective cleav-ages are promoted by a mobile proton. The peptide witha fixed charge and one added proton, [ O
3P+CH2C(dO)-
LDIFSDF +H]2+, fragments much more efficiently than
the corresponding peptide with a fixed charge, an Arg andone added proton, [ O
3P+CH2C(dO)-LDIFSDFR +H]2+;
both of these fragment more efficiently than the peptidewith a fixed charge and no added proton, O
3P+CH2C(dO)-
LDIFSDF. MS/MS/MS (i.e., MS3) experimental results for
bnions formed at Asp -Xxx from O3P+CH2C(dO)-LDIFS-
DF and its H/D exchange derivative, O3P+CH2C(dO)-
LDIFSDF- d11,are consistent with the b nions formed at
Asp-Xxx having a succinic anhydride cyclic structure.
MS/MS experiments were also carried out for O3P+CH2C-
(dO)-AAAA, a peptide derivative containing active hydro-
gens only at amide nitrogens plus the C-terminus, and itsactive H/D exchange product, O
3P+CH2C(dO)-AAAA- d5.
The results show that a hydrogen originally located at anamide nitrogen is transferred away in the formation of a
cyclic charge remote b ion.
High-throughput peptide sequencing is highly desirable in
proteomics and related bioscience. While the conventional method,Edman sequencing, does not fulfill this task, tandem massspectrometry (MS/MS) provides a means for rapid identificationand characterization of peptides/proteins.
1-4State-of-the-art mass
spectrometry instrumentation and computer technologies havemade it possible to run samples in a highly automated fashion.Automated interpretation methods for MS/MS data,
5-10e.g.,
correlation analysis between experimental MS/MS spectra andtheoretical MS/MS spectra generated from amino acid sequencestretches in protein or translated DNA databases, have beendeveloped to help solve the bottleneck problem of data interpreta-tion in MS/MS analysis of peptides/proteins. With the foreseeablecompletion of the Human Genome Project,
11MS/MS studies of
peptides/proteins based on correlation analysis using DNA/protein databases could become even more powerful tools in thefuture. Note that existing algorithms have already taken advantageof the knowledge regarding peptide fragmentation gained byapplied and fundamental research performed over the last twodecades. However, the current understanding of peptide frag-mentation mechanisms is still not sufficient to ensure highcorrelation between theoretically predicted MS/MS spectra andexperimental results. For example, the existing algorithms usuallygenerate a theoretical spectrum such that all the fragment ionswithin a series occur with the same probability (i.e., the assump-

Published on Web 11/03/2000tion is made that peptide ions cleave nonselectively across the
peptide backbone). This is not consistent with experimentalobservation for selective/enhanced cleavage at certain specificamide linkages. For example, the selective/enhanced cleavagesof the amide linkage at the C(O) -N bond C-terminal to an acidic
residue (e.g., at Asp -Xxx),
12-18or at the C(O) -N bond N-terminal
to a proline residue (i.e., Xxx -Pro),19,20have been noticed.
However, the fact that these selective/enhanced cleavages do notalways occur might have discouraged the investigators fromincluding them in existing computer-based interpretation ofpeptide MS/MS spectra. Therefore, thorough investigations forimproved understanding, on a molecular level, of the enhancementor absence of certain fragment ions in MS/MS experiments arewarranted with the long-term goal of providing additional andimproved predictive rules for interpretation of peptide MS/MSspectra.
Selective gas-phase cleavage at the peptide bond C-terminal
to an Asp residue (i.e., Asp -Xxx) in protonated or sodiated peptide
ions has been investigated by several research groups.
12-17A
succinic anhydride five-membered ring structure has been pro-posed by Martin and co-workers in this journal,
12and accepted
by other authors,16,17,21as the structure at the ªC-terminusº of the
N-terminal fragment (either ionic or neutral), following gas-phasecleavage of the Asp -Xxx peptide bond. The involvement of the
Asp side-chain carboxylic hydrogen in this fragmentation wasconfirmed by esterification that blocked the selective/enhancedcleavage at Asp -Xxx.
12Martin and co-workers proposed a mech-
anism for cleavage involving proton transfer from the Asp acidic
side chain to the adjacent amide nitrogen C-terminal to Asp.12To
explain the selective cleavage at Asp -Xxx in sodiated peptides,
Beauchamp and co-workers suggested a salt bridge model.16For
singly protonated peptides, Qin and Chait noticed the presenceof an arginine residue (Arg) in the peptides that demonstratedselective cleavage at Asp -Xxx.
14Gaskell and co-workers proposed
the involvement of bridging between the Arg and acidic sidechains in the enhanced cleavage.
22,23MS/MS results for a series
of singly protonated oligopeptides X-Leu-Asp-Val-Leu-Gln (X )
Arg, Lys, His) showed that the selective cleavage at Asp -Val
occurred in the presence of an Arg residue but not when Argwas replaced with other basic amino acid residues (i.e., lysine orhistidine).
24This finding is likely related to the fact that argininehas the highest gas-phase basicity (GBs) among the 20 common
amino acids.25-27Recently, selective cleavage at Asp -Xxx in a
series of protonated peptides was investigated by using severaldifferent activation methods in a collaboration of the Wysockigroup with the groups of Gaskell and Futrell.
17Selective cleavage
at Asp -Xxx was observed only when the number of added protons
did not exceed the number of arginines.17This suggested that
when the ionizing protons are sequestered at arginine, the cleavage
catalyzed by the acidic hydrogen of the Asp residue, whichrequires a seven-membered-ring intermediate, becomes signifi-cant.
17When proton(s) in excess of the number of Arg are
available, nonselective cleavage involving the ionizing proton(s)occurs at all backbone residues (e.g., oxazolone formation bynucleophilic attack on a protonated carbonyl
28-31via a five-
membered ring, see Scheme 1.)
The approach in the present study is to use a fixed-charge
chemical group to ªmimicº a protonated Arg residue (i.e., an Argresidue that presumably sequesters an ionizing proton). Thisªmimicº consists of a 
3P+-CH 2C(dO) group ( )2,4,6-tri-
methoxyphenyl), which is attached to the N-terminal nitrogen ofpeptides via solid-phase synthesis. As previously reported in thisjournal by Huang et al. who referred to it as the TMPP -Ac
group,
32this fixed-charge group gives virtually no neutral loss from
the charged moiety and, thus, does not complicate the interpreta-tion of MS/MS spectra of such peptide derivatives. An immediategoal of the present study is to see whether fixed-charge mimicsof Asp-containing peptides previously investigated
17exhibit frag-
mentation characteristics similar to those of corresponding pro-tonated peptides with a protonated arginine at the N-terminus.

dimethylformamide (DMF). The resin-bound peptides (0.037mmol) with the free N-terminus (active side chains still protected)were then reacted with 0.10 mmol of iodoacetic anhydride inanhydrous DMF for 25 min, washed by DMF twice, and reactedwith 0.15 mmol of tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)phosphine in toluene/DMF (1:1; v/v) for 90 min. Following this, the resin-bound fixed-charge derivatives were washed with toluene, DMF, and thendichloromethane. Finally, the peptide derivatives, tris(2,4,6-trimeth-oxyphenyl)phosphonium-acetyl-Leu-Asp-Ile-Phe-Ser-Asp-Phe, andtris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium-acetyl-Leu-Asp-Ile-Phe-Ser-Asp-Phe-Arg were cleaved from the resin and any protectedamino acid side chains were deprotected using a 1.5-mL mixtureof trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/H
2O/1,2-ethanedithiol (95:2.5:2.5;
v/v/v). Tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala was cleaved from the resin with TFA/H
2O (95:5; v/v). The
Fmoc derivatives of the amino acids required for the synthesiswere obtained from Novabiochem or Advanced Chemtech. TheC-terminal residue for the synthesis was purchased alreadyattached to Wang resin from Novabiochem or Advanced Chemtech.Once a peptide derivative was precipitated in diethyl ether, itsidentity and purity were confirmed by electrospray ionization massspectrometry. Hereafter, the peptide derivatives are referred toas

Electrospray Ionization (ESI)/Collision-Induced Dissocia-
tion (CID) In an Ion Trap. Low-energy CID experiments, which
involve collision of mass-selected ions into a target gas, werecarried out on a Finnigan quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer(LCQ). The precipitated fixed-charge peptide derivatives weredissolved in a solution of MeOH/H
2O (70:30; v/v) containing 0.2%
acetic acid to give a concentration of 20 -100 pmol/ íL. The peptide
derivative solutions were then injected into the ESI source at aflow rate of 3 íL/min. The applied voltage on the needle of the
ESI source was 4.8 kV and the capillary temperature wasmaintained at 200 °C for all samples. Unit mass selection of the
precursor ion was performed. The operational parameter thatcontrols the excitation energy in MS/MS or MS/MS/MS (i.e.,MS
3) mode (indicated as ª% relative collision energyº by the
manufacturer) was incremented in small steps to monitor low-energy fragmentation processes for the precursor ions selected.The collision gas was helium. In the ion trap, energy is depositedin approximately a thermal distribution. Because of the stepwise,multistep nature of the energy deposition, lower energy processesare often favored over higher energy processes.
34,35
CID experiments were also performed in the ion trap instru-
ment for active hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange derivativesof
3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF and 3P+CH 2C(dO)-AAAA. The
fixed-charge derivative 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF or 3P+CH 2C-
(dO)-AAAA was first dissolved in deuterated CH 3OD solvent
containing 0.5% CD 3COOD for 20 min, after which it was
introduced into the ESI source via infusion. The infusion line wasprecleaned with CH
3OD. Finally, the CID spectra of 3P+CH 2C-
(dO)-LDIFSDF- d11or3P+CH 2C(dO)-AAAA- d5were acquired.Electrospray Ionization/Surface-Induced Dissociation
(SID). SID involves collisions of mass-selected ions with a target
surface. The instrument used for SID experiments is a dualquadrupole tandem mass spectrometer specifically designed forlow-energy ion surface collisions and has been describedpreviously.
17,36 -38It is composed of two Extrel 4000 u quadrupoles
positioned at 90 °with the target surface placed between the two
quadrupoles. Incident angles of the precursor ion beam are 45 °-
50°with respect to the surface normal. The ESI source used in
the SID instrument is a heated capillary design based on those ofChowdhury et al.
39and Papac et al .40The solutions (same as those
described in the CID experiments) were sprayed at atmosphericpressure from a syringe needle held at 4.0 -4.8 kV (flow rate of 2
íL/min), toward a metal capillary (120 V) maintained at 130 °C.
The ions were directed toward a skimmer cone (90 V) and enteredinto the high-vacuum region of the mass spectrometer. The SIDcollision energy is defined by the voltage difference between theskimmer and the collision surface multiplied by the charge stateof the ions. The collision target surface used in the SID experi-ments was a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 2-(perfluorode-cyl)ethanethiol on gold (i.e., CF
3(CF 2)9CH 2CH 2SAu) prepared by
procedures described previously.17,41With this surface, the average
conversion of kinetic energy to internal energy has been estimatedto be 20 -30%.
42-44In addition to different energy deposition
functions corresponding to SID and ion trap CID, these experi-ments also have different time frames for dissociation with onlymicroseconds allowed for dissociation in the Q-surface-Q instru-ment and milliseconds to seconds in the ion trap.
SID mass spectra were obtained over a range of collision
energies. SID fragmentation efficiencies, defined as the ratio of
were plotted as a function of collision energy (eV) for ESI-
generated ions of the Asp-containing fixed-charge peptide deriva-tives. The curve fittings for the raw data points were performedusing the function

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
MS/MS Spectra of the Asp-Containing Fixed-Charge
Derivatives. Two different methods, low-energy CID in an ion-
trap instrument and SID in a quadrupole tandem mass spectrom-eter, were utilized to obtain the spectra discussed below. Thesemethods were chosen because they deposit different distributionsof internal energy and allow different time frames for dissociation.In previous work on peptides containing a protonated arginineand acidic residues, we have shown selective cleavages at acidicresidues to persist throughout a range of instrument types anddissociation time frames.
17,18,24Labeling of peaks in the spectra
follows the nomenclature defined by Roepstorff and Fohlman45
and modified by Biemann.46,47For example, b nor y ndesignates
the N-terminal or the C-terminal charged fragment, respectively,where cleavage occurs at the nth peptide bond (counting from
the N- or C-terminus, respectively). The ions that formallycorrespond to a loss of 28 amu (CO) from b
nions are called a n
ions.
(A) Electrospray Ionization/Low-Energy Collision-In-
duced Dissociation in the Ion Trap Instrument. Figure 1
shows ESI/low-energy CID spectra obtained with the ion trapinstrument for derivatized peptides in which the 
3P+CH 2C(dO)
group is attached to the N-terminus of the Asp-containing peptides,LDIFSDF and L DIFSDFR. The singly charged 
3P+CH 2C(dO)-
LDIFSDF ions cleave selectively at the DI and DF peptide bonds
to give b-type N-terminal fragment ions (b 2and b 6ions, respec-
tively; Figure 1a). The peak at m/z573 corresponds to the fixed-
charge group (i.e., fragment 3P+CHdCdO).32Note that at
relatively higher collision energies when other fragment ions occuror even when the precursor ion peak disappears, b
2and b 6ions
are still the dominant fragment ions among other fragment ions,including d
2ions, d 6ions, and b n/anion pairs at positions other
than Asp residue positions (spectrum available in SupportingInformation). When an ionizing proton is added to 
3P+CH 2C(d
O)-LDIFSDF to form an [M +H]2+ion, the dissociation pattern
changes dramatically. The doubly charged [M +H]2+ions of the
derivative 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF, with one charge provided
by the phosphonium group and the other by an ionizing proton,cleave nonselectively along the whole peptide backbone asdemonstrated by the presence of the entire b
nion series (Figure
1b). However, when an Arg and one added proton are present inthe peptide 
3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDFR,the doubly charged [M
+H]2+ions cleave selectively at two Asp -Xxx peptide bonds
(Figure 1c). Complementary b 6/y2and b 2/y6ion pairs produced
by cleavage of the DF and DI peptide bonds, respectively,dominate the spectrum (Figure 1c). The lower intensity of the y
2
ion, relative to that of the b 6ion in the b 6/y2complementary pair,
is the result of the mass discrimination that occurs near the low-mass cutoff end of ion trap MS/MS mode.
48,49It is noteworthy
that, on the dissociation of the singly charged 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDFRions, dominant b 2and b 6ions are also observed along
with an abundant H 2O loss peak and an abundant b 7+H2O ion
(spectrum available in Supporting Information; formation of b 7+
H2O discussed below).
(B) Electrospray Ionization/Surface-Induced Dissociation
in the Tandem Quadrupole Instrument. Figure 2 shows the
ESI/SID spectra for the same parent ions as those shown inFigure 1. SID spectra often differ in appearance from thosepresented for low-energy CID in the ion trap (Figure 2 vs 1) dueto different distributions of internal energy and different timeframes for dissociation. However, inherent similarities can bereadily seen. For example, the complementary b
6/y2ion pair
dominates in the MS/MS spectra of [ 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDFR
+H+]2+(Figures 2c and 1c), while nonselective cleavages occur
at all the peptide bonds for the [M +H]2+ions of 3P+CH 2C(d
O)-LDIFSDF (e.g, an entire series of b nions as well as some y-type
ions are observed; Figures 2b and 1b). Much higher intensityratios of a
n/bnions are observed for doubly charged [M +H]2+
ions of 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF by SID (Figure 2b) than by low-

due to very low intensities). The peak at m/z181 corresponds to
the fragment CH 2+()2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl) that has been
suggested as a further dissociation product via a skeletal rear-rangement
32of the fragment ion at m/z573 (3P+CHdCdO).
In the SID spectrum of singly charged 3P+CH 2C(dO)-
LDIFSDF ions (Figure 2a), the only b-type ions present are those
corresponding to the cleavage at the two C( dO)-N positions
C-terminal to the Asp residues (b 2and b 6); a nseries ions occur at
other positions. In addition, d 2and c 1ions, as well as d 6and c 5
ions, corresponding to cleavage adjacent to the two Asp residuesare observed (Figure 2a). It is of interest that the SID resultsshown in Figure 2a are similar to those obtained previously withMALDI/PSD or FAB/keV CID for the N-terminal fixed-chargederivatives of other Asp-containing peptides.
21,50In all of these
experiments,21,50as well as in ion trap CID at relatively higher
collision energies for singly charged ions of fixed-charge peptidederivatives (spectrum available in Supporting Information), oc-currences of b
n,dn, and c n-1ions at the Asp residue of the nthposition, in addition to a-type ions at all other residues, are
observed. Watson and co-workers recently suggested that theoccurrence of b
n,dn, and c n-1ions be used to identify an Asp in
peptide sequences of 3P+-CH 2C(dO)-derivatized tryptic digests
of proteins.51Gaskell and co-workers previously noted d nand c n-1
ion formation from b nions produced by Asp -Xxx cleavage.52
Furthermore, occurrences of d nand c n-1, along with b n,a tt h e
Asp residue of the nth position, have also been observed for singly
protonated peptides containing an Arg (presumably protonatedArg) at the N-termini.

Formation of d n/cn-1at the Asp Residue of the nth
Position. Different approaches described below were used to
investigate whether the d n/cn-1at the Asp residue of the nth
positions (Figure 2a) can be produced from the correspondingb
nion. First, as shown in Figure 3, the fractional abundance of
the ions related to the two Asp residues is plotted as a function ofSID collision energy. From this figure it is seen that, as thecollision energy increases, the fractional abundance of [ ∑(d ion)
+∑(c ion)] increases whereas that of the ∑(b ion) decreases.
This dependence of abundance ratio of ( ∑d+∑c)/∑bo nt h e
collision energy suggests that the d
2/c1and d 6/c5ions corre-
sponding to cleavage at the Asp positions (Figure 2a) are producedfrom the b
2and b 6ions, respectively. This was further investigated
as described below.
MS/MS/MS (i.e., MS3) experiments were performed in the

MS3using CID. It is seen in Figure 4a that d 2and c 1ions can be
produced from b 2ions. It is worth noting that dissociation of the
d2ions of 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF gives notrace of c 1ions (MS3
spectrum available in Supporting Information); i.e., both d 2and
c1are products of b 2fragmentation. Additionally, dissociation of
the b 6ions of 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF gives d 6,c5,b2,d2, and
c1ions (MS3spectrum available in Supporting Information).
Finally, 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF-d11,produced by H/D ex-
change (see Experimental Section) and consistent with deuteriumat each of the C(O)NH active sites as well as each of the carboxylicacid and serine OH groups, was fragmented under MS/MS CIDconditions in the ion trap (spectrum available in SupportingInformation). The masses recorded for b
n,dn, and c n-1fragment
ions at Asp residues of labeled and unlabeled precursor ions arelisted in Table 1. Following the MS/MS fragmentation, the b
2ion
(m/z803) containing two deuterium atoms was selected and a
MS3spectrum was acquired and is provided in Figure 4b. Note
that both c 1and d 2ions contain two deuterium atoms (MS3
spectrum in Figure 4b, as well as MS/MS data in Table 1).
Plausible pathways for dissociation of the b nions produced
by Asp -Xxx cleavage are proposed in Scheme 2. The d nion
occurring at the Asp residue of the nth position can be formed
by loss of a CO 2and a CO molecule from the five-membered-ring
anhydride structure (Scheme 2a). Note that this is different froma previously reported mechanism for common d
nion formation inwhich a common d nion forms via an (a n+1) radical ion.46
Migration of a hydrogen from the anhydride structure to the
adjacent carbonyl oxygen N-terminal to the Asp residue, via a six-membered ring, can lead to formation of a tautomer of the c
n-1
ion, with concomitant loss of a neutral molecule of maleic
anhydride (Scheme 2b). The numbers of deuterium atoms in b 2
and b 6ions alone (Table 1) are not direct evidence for, but are
consistent with, the cyclic anhydride structure of these b ions.As illustrated with Scheme 2, the MS/MS data (Table 1) and MS
3
results (Figure 4a,b) obtained for labeled and unlabeled 3P+-
CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF are consistent with the previously proposed
anhydride formation for the b nions formed at Asp -Xxx.12,16,17,21
Further fragmentation of these anhydride b nions produces d nand
cn-1ions, which contain the same number of deuterium atoms as
the b nion, consistent with Scheme 2. In contrast to these ions
formed at Asp -Xxx, it is shown in Figure 4c that the b nions
produced at positions other than C-terminal to Asp do not loseCO and CO
2, but rather fragment by loss of CO to form a nions.
The production of b 2from b 3, in addition to a 3,o nM S3of the b 3
from 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF, is rationalized below in the
section on the structure of generic charge-remote b ions.
Mechanism for Selective Cleavage at Asp -Xxx. We show
a mechanism in Scheme 3 for the formation of b nions at Asp -
Xxx linkages in the presence of a fixed charge. The ªremoteºpositive charge in this scheme represents the quaternary phos-phonium in the fixed-charge peptide derivatives or a protonatedArg residue in protonated Arg-containing peptides as previouslyreported.
17H-bonding to the amide oxygen promotes the nucleo-
philic attack of the Asp side-chain carboxyl oxygen on the amidecarbonyl carbon by making the carbonyl carbon of the Asp -Xxx
amide bond electropositive (Scheme 3). The H-bonded intermedi-ate that promotes nucleophilic attack was found in molecularmodeling calculations previously reported.
18In that work, out of
10 000 gas-phase conformers of singly protonated RGDGGGDG
sampled, 5% were found to have favorable H-bonds between the
acidic hydrogen of either the third and/or seventh aspartic acidand their adjacent amide oxygen.

Scheme 3), the five-membered-ring intermediate is formed, andupon a hydrogen rearrangement and cleavage of the C -N bond,

Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 72, No. 23, December 1, 2000 5809is produced. It should be noted that if the ªremoteº positive charge
(e.g., a protonated Arg) were to be located somewhere on theC-terminal side of the Asp residue, the succinic anhydride wouldbe the terminating structure of a neutral N-terminal fragment and
consequently, an ionic C-terminal fragment (i.e., a y-type ion)
would occur upon the cleavage of Asp -Xxx (refer to the MS/
MS spectra in refs 12, 14, and 17).
MS/MS/MS of the b
6ion from [ 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF+
H]2+produced a spectrum (available in Supporting Information)
similar to that in Figure 4a and b (loss of CO 2and CO), suggestingthat the anhydride product ion structure is produced at Asp -
Xxx even in the presence of an ionizing proton. To explain thisproduct, Scheme 3 needs to be modified only slightly: an ionizingproton present at the carbonyl oxygen being attacked by thecarboxylic OH of Asp simplifies the mechanism shown in Scheme3 by not requiring the initial seven-membered-ring formation. Bycontrast, MS
3of the b 4ion of [ 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF+H]2+
produces mainly the a 4ion. For peptides with an Arg and one
ionizing proton (a sequestered charge) but no fixed charge, theMS
3results parallel those for the fixed-charge derivatives; i.e.,
cleavage at Asp and further fragmentation of the correspondingb
nion leads to d nand c n-1ions while cleavage at a residue such
as Phe and further fragmentation of the corresponding b nion leads
to the a nion. The above cases of Asp -Xxx cleavage correspond
to a final product in which charge is present at the amino terminusand the new carboxy terminus of the amino terminal fragment isthe neutral anhydride. When there is no fixed charge and no Arg,e.g., when [LDIFSDF +H]
+is fragmented, further fragmentation
of the b 6ion (the ion produced by cleavage of the DF bond) is
dominated by H 2O loss and not formation of d 6and c 5while further
fragmentation of the b 4ion (the ion produced by cleavage of the
FS bond) leads to the a 4ion (spectra available in Supporting
Information). In this case, where there is no fixed charge and nosequestration of the ionizing charge (no Arg), there is nodistinctive ªsignatureº for cleavage at Asp and it is not clearwhether the product ion structure is a protonated anhydride orsome other structure.
The Structure of ªGenericº Charge Remote b
nIons
Generated from Peptides Derivatized To Contain a FixedCharge and No Ionizing Proton . In the sections above, strong
experimental evidence is provided that supports an anhydridestructure for b ions produced by Asp -Xxx cleavage. In peptides
with a fixed charge, the anhydride structure of the Asp b ions issupported in two cases: with no added charge (charge-remote bion formation) and also in the case where a proton is added to apeptide that has a fixed charge (charge-directed b ion formation).Scheme 2
Scheme 3
5810Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 72, No. 23, December 1, 2000The structure of b ions formed at other amino acid residues in
the presence of an ionizing proton (ªgenericº b ions) is commonlyaccepted to be a protonated oxazolone.
28-31,53 -55In the case where
charge is retained somewhere other than the cleaved site, aketene-type structure C(R) dCdO has been suggested as a
possible charge-remote b ion structure but the structure has notbeen proven.
21Deuterium labeling provides one means to address
the question of the structure of the generic charge-remote b ionsproduced in the absence of an ionizing proton.
Figure 5 shows a comparison of the fragment ion masses for

3P+CH 2C(dO)-AAAA, a peptide containing active hydrogens only
at amide nitrogens and the C-terminus, and its H/D exchangeproduct 
3P+CH 2C(dO)-AAAA- d5. On the basis of the results of
Figure 5a vs c, the numbers of deuteriums in the b ions of 3P+-
CH 2C(dO)-AAAA- d5(part c) are 0, 1, and 2 for b 1,b2, and b 3ions,
respectively. This indicates that a hydrogen/deuterium at theamide nitrogen migrates away from the N-terminal fragment information of the charge-remote b ions. The location of thetransferred hydrogen, from the amide nitrogen and NOT fromtheR-carbon, shows that the most probable structure for a generic
b ion is NOT a ketene structure but is instead a structure thatinvolves cyclization or unsaturation at nitrogen. Scheme 4 (left)shows two possible structures for generic b ions produced fromthe N-terminal fixed-charge peptide derivative, i.e., possible b ionstructures produced in the absence of an ionizing proton: a neutraloxazolone and a neutral aziridinone. (Note that, in the absenceof an ionizing proton, the mechanism proposed for oxazoloneformation in the presence of an ionizing proton (Scheme 1) cannotbe operative.) Other possible structures include substituted smallcyclic peptides. Previously, transfer of a hydrogen from the amidenitrogen of the N-terminal fragment has been shown in y ionformation from protonated peptides.
56,57Wesdemiotis and co-
workers investigated this transfer for the N-terminal neutralfragments by neutralization/reionization mass spectrometry(NRMS)
53,58and proposed an aziridinone structure when the
N-terminal neutral fragment produced during the formation of ay ion is a single amino acid residue.
58
Although there are not enough data here to define the charge-
remote b nion structure, any structure that is proposed must meet
the following criteria. (i) The charge-remote b nstructure must
explain the labeling results that are consistent with H(D) transferaway from the amide N in the formation of the b
nions. (ii) The
charge-remote b nstructure must allow for facile conversion of the
bnions to the corresponding a nions. Both SID spectra (Figure
2a and SID spectrum of 3P+CH 2C(dO)-AAAA available in
Supporting Information) and high-energy CID spectra reportedin the literature
32for derivatized peptides, with the only charge
provided by the phosphonium group at the amino terminus,contain dominant a
nion series rather than b nion series (the
exception being dominant b ions only at Asp -Xxx positions; see
Figure 2a). The three-membered aziridinone structure, for ex-ample, might be more easily converted to a
nions than would the

The proposed charge-remote b nion structure must account for
the difference in fragmentation of the b 4and b 3ions of 3P+CH 2C-
(dO)-LDIFSDF (Figure 4c). Note that the MS/MS/MS spectra
of these two different b ions show that b 4does not readily produce
b3(Figure 4c inset) while b 3readily produces b 2(Figure 4c),
suggesting the involvement of the Asp in the formation of b 2.A s
an example, Scheme 4 (right) illustrates that the formation of b 2
from b 3(by attack of the Asp side chain on the backbone) can be
envisioned in a much more straightforward manner for theaziridinone than for the oxazolone. In summary, the labelingresults show that hydrogen is lost from the amide nitrogen inthe formation of charge-remote b ions, the labeling results thussuggest a charge-remote b ion with unsaturation or cyclization atthe amide nitrogen, the charge-remote b
nions produce a nions
readily, and the charge-remote b nions give facile production of
b2from b 3in the fragmentation of 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF.
Additional studies are in progress to better define the structureof the charge remote b
nions.
Formation of b N-1+H2O Ions. The dominant fragment ions
in Figure 5a and c correspond to a truncated peptide b N-1+H2O
ion (where Nrefers to the total number of amino acids in the
peptide). The b N-1+H2O ions were also produced in the
dissociation spectra of 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF,3P+CH 2C(d
O)-LDIFSDFR, and [ 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDFR+H]2+. Gaskell
and co-workers59suggested that these ions form via a seven-
membered-ring H-bonded intermediate and five-membered-ringnucleophilic attack, similar to that suggested in Scheme 3 forcleavage at Asp -Xxx, followed by loss of NH -CH(R)CO. For

3P+CH 2C(dO)-AAAA, this peak disappears when the methyl
ester is fragmented. The b N-1+H2O ions involve the carboxylic
acid group of the carboxyl terminus and a fragmentation mech-anism related to that proposed for Asp -Xxx cleavage. It is logical
that this pathway can be favored under conditions similar to thosethat favor Asp -Xxx cleavage; i.e., when the charge is tightly bound
elsewhere in the molecule, the acidic side chain or carboxyterminus causes selective dissociation. The b
N-1+H2O ion ismore dominant in the spectrum if no acidic residues are present
(see Figure 5) or if Arg is present at the carboxy terminus (Figurein Supporting Information).
Competitive Nonselective Cleavage Promoted by a ªMo-
bileº Proton. With a proton added to the peptide derivative 
3P+-
CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF, nonselective cleavages occur across the
whole peptide backbone (Figures 1b and 2b). Previously, a generalmodel for the fragmentation of protonated peptides, based on theªmobile protonº
41,60or equivalently, the ªheterogeneously distrib-
uted protonº,29,61,62has evolved. The ªmobile protonº model states
that, in the absence of a strongly basic residue (e.g., Arg), thecleavages of various peptide bonds in protonated peptides occurfollowing a migration of a mobile proton to the carbonyl oxygenand/or amide nitrogen of the backbone.
41,60In other words, the
low-energy pathways that form b nor y nions are promoted by
charge-directed cleavage of peptide bonds initiated by a mobileavailable proton. For example, a proton located at the oxygen ofan amide moiety promotes the nucleophilic attack by the adjacentbackbone carbonyl oxygen on the carbonyl carbon of the proto-nated group (see Scheme 1) and, thus, promotes the formationof an oxazolone-structure b
nion.28,29The relative energetics of
fragmentation for the Asp-containing fixed-charge peptide deriva-tives were investigated by SID. The ESI/SID fragmentationefficiency curves
41,60are provided in Figure 6. Approximately 75-
eV collision energy is required to achieve 50% fragmentation forthe
3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF singly charged ions, whereas, for
the doubly charged [M +H]2+ions with the addition of an extra
proton to 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF, the required collision energy
for 50% fragmentation is dramatically lowered to 20 eV (Figure
6). In Figure 6, the fragmentation efficiency (dashed line) for thedoubly charged [M +H]
2+ions of 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDFR
is decreased (i.e., the curve is shifted to higher collision energies)relative to that of the [M +H]
2+ions of 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF.
The fact that the two curves for doubly charged ions shift to

5812Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 72, No. 23, December 1, 2000different positions suggests that the shift in the ESI/SID frag-
mentation efficiency curves of the doubly charged ions versus thesingly charged ion is notsimply a charge effect (e.g., Coulombic
repulsion). It has been previously reported in the literature thata multiply protonated ion at a higher charge state does not
necessarily fragment more easily than that at a lower charge
state.
15,63Because the guanindino group of the arginine residue
is highly basic, the added proton in the [M +H]2+ions of 3P+-
CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDFRis most likely retained by the Arg side
chain. For the derivative 3P+CH 2C(dO)-LDIFSDF without an Arg
residue, the available mobile proton, butnotthe facile fragmenta-
tion simply due to two charges, makes the fragmentation mucheasier for the [M +H]
2+ions relative to the M+ions (see the
relative positions of the two solid curves in Figure 6). Thissuggests that charge-directed fragmentation channels due to anavailable mobile proton (e.g., acid-catalyzed formation
28,29,54of
oxazolone-like b nions or the corresponding y-type ions) are
favored kinetically (five-ring attack) over those catalyzed by Aspresidues (seven-ring intermediate leading to five-ring attack) asdescribed in Scheme 3. As a result, selective cleavages at Asp -
Xxx are no longer dominant when a mobile proton is available.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, the present results unequivocally demonstrate
that, in the absence of an available mobile proton, selectivecleavages at a peptide bond immediately C-terminal to an Aspresidue (Asp -Xxx) dominate the MS/MS spectra of chargedpeptides. Their occurrence in MS/MS measurements of Asp-
containing peptides is proposed to be promoted by a seven-membered-ring H-bonded structure involving the acidic hydrogenof the Asp side chain. The resulting product b
nion is accordingly
a succinic anhydride five-membered cyclic structure as supportedby MS
3experimental results. In the presence of an available
mobile proton, onset energies for dissociation are loweredsignificantly and low-energy dissociation pathways that presumablyinvolve proton-catalyzed formation of oxazolone-type structuresare favored over the cleavages promoted by the cyclic H-bondinginvolving the Asp side chain. This leads to nonselective fragmenta-tion patterns, as well as improved fragmentation efficiencies. Theb
nions formed at Asp in the absence or presence of a mobile
proton and a fixed charge have an anhydride structure that furtherfragments to form d
nand c n-1ions. In contrast, the ªgenericº b n
ions produced by a charge-remote mechanism from singly
charged fixed-charge peptide derivatives are suggested to be cyclicstructures that readily fragment to produce a
nions.
The results presented in this and related papers will help
strengthen the analytical utility of MS-based sequencing protocolsby providing improved and additional predictive rules of peptidedissociation for computer-aided interpretation of MS/MS spectra.The data described here and in our earlier work show thatenhanced/selective cleavage occurs at Asp -Xxx sites when the
ionizing charge is sequestered at arginine. When protons in excessof the number of Arg are present, enhanced/selective cleavagesat Asp -Xxx are not expected.
