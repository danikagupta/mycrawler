ABSTRACT  
Aspergillus niger , a common soil borne fungus is industrially impo rtant and utilized in the field  of 
biotechnolo gy and food microbiology. It is enormously cultured in large scale due to its positive 
significance in production of biofuels, chemicals and enzymes such as alpha -amylase, lipases, and 
proteases  in the production of citric acid. Aspergillus niger  is easily isolated from common thing 
such as dust, paint, grains and soil. Commonly in laboratories, Aspergillus niger  is isolated via 
chemostat cultures which can test positively or negatively for the fungi. This review paper 
describes methods used for cu ltivating Aspergillus niger  for enzymes and biofuel production. It 
addresses the gene ral considerations pertaining the  growth requirements mechanisms i.e. the 
morphological characteristics , environmental conditions, mass transfer, oxygen  transfer  and media  
components , along with important physiological parameters that lead to maximum sporulation in 
fungi . Though Potato Dextrose Agar ( PDA ) is the most commonly used media , but there is need 
for more economical way of  cultivation. In contrast, a variety of opt imized methods can offer 
substantial cultivation, but few feature the likelihood for levels of productivity that offset their 
high cost. One of the greatest challenges is to modify media  in order to benefit from economy of 
scale and produce meaningful quantities of enzymes and biofuel s. This paper also highlights some 
of the growth morphology, mass transfer, oxygen transfer, vegetative growth and asexual 
development .

1. INTRODUCTION  
Aspergillus  is a genus consisting of several 
hundred -mold  species found in various 
climates worldwide. The Italian priest and 
biologist Pier Antonio Micheli first 
catalogued Aspergillus  in 1729 . Viewing the 
fungi under a microscope, Micheli was 
reminded of the shape of an aspergillum 
(holy water sprinkler), from  Latin spargere 
(to sprinkle), and named the genus 
accordingly (Bartniki, 1968). Aspergillus 
niger was described in 1867 in a manuscript 
entitled “ Physiologie des mucédinées ” by the 
French botanist Philippe Edouard Leon Van 
Tieghem. (Jan and Han, 2013).  
Aspergillus niger  is a haploid filamentous 
fungi and is a very essential microorganism 
in the field of biology. In addition to 
producing extracellular enzymes and citric acid, Aspergillus niger  is used for waste 
management and biotransformation. The 
fungi  most commonly found in mesophilic 
environments such as decaying vegetation or 
soil and plants (Schuster et al., 2002).  
Aspergillus niger  is relatively harmless 
compared to other fila mentous fungi. Despite 
this, there have been some medical cases that 
have been accounted for, such as lung 
infections or ear infections in patients that 
have a weakened immune system, or an 
immune system that has been impaired by a 
disease or medical treatment. In the case of 
ear infections, Aspergillus niger  invades the 
outer  ear canal which can cause damage to 
the skin it came in contact with (May and 
Adams, 1997). The production of ochratoxin 
A from Aspergillus niger , is liable to cause 
immunutoxicity in animals. The effects on 
animal include a decrease in antibody

 responses , a size reduction in immune 
organs, and an alteration in the production of 
cytokine that  are proteins and peptides 
specifically used in signaling ( Schuster et  al., 
2002). Food that has been contaminated by 
Aspergillus niger’s  toxic metabolite has  a 
major effect on the poultry industry. 
Different animals such as chicken, turkey and 
ducks, are very prone to ochratoxin (May and 
Adams, 1997).  Aspergillus niger  has been a 
very important microbe used in the field of 
biotechnology. Many of the enzymes 
produced by  Aspergillus niger , such as citric 
acid, amylases, lipases, cellulases, xylanases 
and proteases, are considered GRAS ( 
generally recognized as safe) by the United 
States Food and Drug Administration and is 
excepted  from the Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act food additive tolerance 
requirements. Even though it is considered 
GRAS, Aspergillus niger still must be treated 
safely and with care (Van de Vondervoort et 
al., 2004).     
Aspergillus niger  produce colonies that are 
composed of white or yellow felt th at is 
covered by dark asexually produce fungal 
spores. Mycelial, or thread -like, hyphae are 
divided by a septum and transparent. 
Conidiophores (asexually produced fungal 
spores) of Aspergillus niger  usually range s 
from 900 -1600 µm in length and contain 
globose (globular) vesicles ranging from 40 -
60 µm in diameter. Each globose vesicle is 
completely covered with biseriate phialides, 
which  are projections from the conidiophores 
of Aspergillus niger . These phialides c ome 
out from brown metulae,  the site where a 
conidiogenous cell is created. The phialides 
go through a process of blastic basipetal 
conidiogenesis to create globose mitospores, 
with a diameter ranges from 3 to 5 µm 
(Debetes et al., 1990).  
Aspergillus niger  is a cosmopolitan fungus. It 
can be isolated from all continents and is not very selective with respect to the 
environmental co nditions. It grows between 
6 to 47oC, pH 1.5 and 9.8 and a water activity 
of ≥ 0.77 (Pitt and Hocking, 2009). 
Aspergillus niger  thrives in the soil and on 
decaying plant material but is also abundant 
in man -made environments. For instance, it 
can be found and in carpet and mattress dust 
(Flannigan et al., 2011). Pitt and Hocking 
(2009) state that A. niger  is by far the most 
common Aspergillus  species responsible for 
postharvest decay of for instance guava’s, 
litchis, mangoes papaya’s, pineapples, 
pomegranates, apples, pears and grapes. 
Other food products such as onions, rice, 
coffee, nuts and sunflower seeds are also 
substrates for  Aspergillus niger.    
2. MORPHOLOGY AND MASS 
TRANSFER  
In submerged cultivations, depending on the 
conditions, the morphology of filamentous 
fungi lies between a compact form, often 
spherical, named pellet and a free dispersed 
form named filamentous (Figure  2). In 
between these two extreme morphologies, 
filame ntous fungi can also grow  as loose 
aggregates named clumps. The parameters 
determining the type of growth are: the 
inoculum level (Papagianni and Mattey, 
2006), the pH (Grimm et al., 2005), the 
concentr ation of trace elements (Majolli and 
Aguirre, 1999; Pera and Callieri, 1997), the 
agitation (Gomez et al., 1988; Grimm et al., 
2005; Papagianni et al., 1998) and the 
aeration (Cui et al., 1998; Grimm et al., 
2005). Moreover,  the hyphal morphology 
itself ca n vary from linear filament to highly 
branched structure. The branching intensity 
decreases in response to low concentration of 
oxygen (Wongwicharn et al., 1999), at low 
agitation (Amanullah et al., 2002) and at low 
growth rate (Wiebe and Trinci, 1991).

Figure -2: The two extreme shapes of Aspergillus spp. : pellet (left) and filamentous (right) (source: 
Audrey, 2007)  
 
The pellet form is  use mainly in the 
production of citric acid (Bodie et al., 1994). 
This shape is initiated by an a gglomeration of 
spores or hyphae (Dynesen and Nielsen, 
2003). One of the disadvantages of this 
growth is the difficulty to control the size of 
the pellet. As the pellet size increases, the 
diffusion of substrate within the pellet 
decreases (Kobayashi et al ., 1973), this 
reduces the productivity of many processes 
(Abarca et al., 2004). The filament form is  
use often for the production of homologous 
and heterologous proteins or secondary 
metabolites (Gyamerah et al., 2002; Paul et 
al., 1994; Shiba  et al., 2001). However, the 
growth as filament and the entanglement of 
hyphae result in a formation of network 
(Figure 2). As the biomass concentration 
increases, the mycelial branched network 
increases the viscosity of the medium, 
leading to a non-Newton ian fluid behavior, 
having relatively low viscosity in region of 
high shear and high viscosity as the shear 
decreases. In stirred tank, the most important 
type of bioreactor used in bioindustry, such 
fluid behavior leads to a non-homogeneous  
broth, well mi xed near the impellers, where 
the shear is high, but with limiting mixing 
elsewhere (Reuss et al., 1982; Li et al., 2002). 
At high biomass concentration, the presence of slow mo ving or stagnant broth areas is  
observed near the fermentor wall (Wernau, 
1985) . In these conditions, the entrance of 
titrant controlling the pH and the entrance of 
the pH pr obe must be carefully position , in 
order to avoid large pH deviations. The 
extracellular pH has indeed a lot of 
importance in Aspergillus  fermentation. 
First, it  influences the production of acids: 
while citric acid can be produce  at low pH, 
production of oxalic and gluconic acids are 
optimal at pH 5 -6 (Ruijter et al., 2002). 
Secondly, pH has been reported to have an 
influence on the morphology of filamentous 
fungi: Pirt and Callow (1959) and Miles and 
Trinci (1983) showed a relation between the 
extracellular pH and the branching intensity 
as well as the hyphal diameter of Penicillium 
chrysogenum , which is another filamentous 
fungi from the same subfamily as Asperg illus 
spp. However, Van Suijdam and Metz (1981) 
reject this correlation . This may be due to the 
difference in the mode of cultivation: 
chemostat for Pirt and Callow and Miles and 
Trinci, and batch cultivations for van 
Suijdam and Metz (1981).  
Transport pro cesses usually affect the 
productivity of bioprocesses and the 
efficiency of bioreactors. Thus, mass transfer 
phenomena belong to common problems,

 which a bioreactor engineer encounters 
during fermentation practice and bioreactor 
design. Gas –liquid (G –L) transfer is often a 
limiting factor of many aerob ic 
fermentations. This is  caused  mainly  by a low 
solubility of oxygen in fermentation media in 
comparison with the solubility of carbon 
sources and other nutrients (Jaroslav et al., 
2002).  
 
In recent years, a irlift bioreactors (ALRs) are 
been extensively investigated as a possible 
alternative to stirred tank bioreactors, which 
are most widely used for fermentation 
purposes. T he ALRs possess features, which 
make them more advantageous for various 
biotechnological applications. A special 
property of ALR is a liquid circulation loop 
created by the interconnected aerating (riser) 
and recirculating sections (downcomer). 
Despite an absenting mechanical agitator, 
this well -defined flow pattern with high 
liquid velocities in line with efficient mixing 
and low uniformly distributed shear stresses 
can create an optimal environment for many 
productive microorganisms ( Jaroslav et al., 
2002).  
 Mathematical model for mass transfer  
Gas phase  is assumed  to be  perfectly mixed .

Where

(gmol-1) 
Mi = molar weight of intending product 
(gmol-1) 
Co* = saturation oxygen concentration 
(mgdm-3) 
Co= actual dissolved oxygen concentration 
(mgdm-3) 
 3. OXYGEN TRANSFER  
Here also the position of the feed port has to 
be considered  carefully in order to limit the 
gradient of substrate. Mixing problems affect 
as well the transfer of gas, especially oxygen, 
which is problematic for aerobic 
fermentation processes. The maximal 
dissolved oxygen concentration in a liquid is 
limited to 0.2 6 mmol O 2/L at 25°C. This 
maximal concentration is affected by the 
existence of stagnant films causing resistance 
to the transfer at the gas/liquid interface and 
at the liquid/cell interface (Figure 3). The 
most important resistance in Newtonian 
media is g enerally considered to be the liquid 
film resistance around the bubble (Kobayashi 
et al., 1973). However,  in non -Newtonian 
cultures such as filamentous fu ngi broths, the 
main resistance  shown to be downstream of 
the air/liquid interface (Li et al., 2002). The 
thickness of these films depends on the 
degree of turbulence and on the physical 
properties of the medium: it increases with 
viscosity (Barberel and Walker, 2000), 
causing a decrease of oxygen transfer. 
Moreover, the mass transfer is proportional to 
the kla coefficient, where “kl” is the mass 
transfer coefficient and “a” is the gas/liquid 
interfacial area per unit liquid volume. Thus,  
the mass transfer from the  gas phase to the 
liquid phase  also decreased by the formation 
of large coalescent air bubbles , which are 
formed due to bad mixing and high viscosity 
and that reduce the exchange surface (Figure 
3). The repartition of air bubbles is affected 
as well by the bad mixing, which means that 
oxygen transfer is mainly taking place near 
the impeller region,  leading to a  
heterogeneity of dissolved oxygen levels in 
the fermenter (Manfredini et al., 1983). 
Furthermore, the high viscosity and the low 
mixing also limit the transfer of oxygen 
within the liquid phase.  
Different parameters can be adjusted for 
better  mixing and transfer such as the 
number, shape and size of the impellers

 (reviewed by Nordkvist, 2005), as well as the 
position of impellers and the impellers speed 
(Loucaides and McManamey, 1973). 
However, increasing the agitation is costly 
for industrial  fermentation and does not  
always lead to an increase in productivity. 
Indeed high agitation level affects the 
morphology by fragmenting the hyphae and 
may lead to a decrease of productivity 
(Makagiansar et al., 1993; Smith and Lilly, 
1990). Moreover, in 2 002, Li et al. pointed 
out that in non-Newtonian  broth, better 
mixing does not always lead to better oxygen 
transfer and that oxygen transfer depends not 
only on the agitation power but a lso on how 
this power is apply  to the culture. Another 
solution to improve mass transfer is the use 
of pulsed feeding. Most fungal industrial 
bioprocesses are carried out using fed batch 
cultivations and studies have shown  that the 
advantages of pulsed feeding leading to 
smaller fungal  elements, to a lower medium 
viscosity and thereby to a better oxygen 
transfer (Bhargava et al., 2003).  
 
One of the most areas in designing and 
scaling -up of fermentation involves oxygen 
transfer from a gas phase to the liquid phase. 
Yet little information  is available on the 
problem in the industrially important cases 
involving non -Newtonian broths. Most of the 
fungal enzymes broths show pseudoplastic 
behavior and the mass transferring rates may 
be critical in determining vessel 
productivities (Sung -Hoon e t al., 1993).  
 
4. MIXING TIME  Norwood and Metzner proposed that the 
Newtonian mixing time versus Reynold’s 
number plot might be a suitable for 
estimating mixing times for pseudoplastic 
fluids. That is,  
ΘM =  α m . NReβm ……………………….. (2) 
 
Problems coupled with oxygen (O 2) supply 
especially occur in viscous fermentation 
broths and in cultures, which contain a large 
amount of cells with high oxygen 
consumption. These problems can be solved 
by different ways. For instance, higher 
airflow  rates is applied; neve rtheless, this 
usually does not help in a bioreactor with a 
viscous non -Newtonian broth ( Godo et al., 
1999). A more intensive oxygen transfer 
from the gas to the liquid phase can be 
achieved by increase of the partial pressure of 
oxygen in the inlet gas st ream, e.g., using 
pure oxygen. However, this solution is 
mostly financially unfavorable  in large 
scales. One of further possibilities is 
adjusting of the existing bioreactor or use of 
a more suitable type of bioreactor ( Jaroslav et 
al., 2002).  
 
Due to high oxygen demand of the fungi A. 
niger , the oxygen transfer from the gas phase 
into the liquid phase was found to be a 
limiting step of the bioconversion. For this 
reason, a great attention has to be paid for the 
optimization  of the bioreactor ope ration 
(mixing, aeration and bioreactor design) in 
order to enhance the oxygen transfer rate  
(Jaroslav et al., 2002).

indicates the concentration of  the oxygen and shows the resistance encountered during the transfer.

Furthermore, mixing problems also lead to 
heat tran sfer problems. Heat transfer usually 
achieved by intern loops or by an external 
jacket. The existence of slow moving or 
stagnant areas near the fermentor wall is a 
problem for temperature control, especially 
when the cooling system is located nearby the 
reactor wall. Bad mixing could  affects the 
repartition of products and nutrients, in 
particular during c ontinuous cultures and fed 
batch cultivations.  
Another way to improve mixing and transfer 
is the use of a rotary jet instead of impellers 
to mix the reactor (Nordkvist, 2005). In such a system, the broth is drawn from the bottom 
of the fermentor, circulat ed by a pump and 
reinjected in the fermentor by a rotary jet 
located in the fermentation medium. Liquid 
feed, titrants and gas can be added in the loop, 
thus limiting the formation of gradients. Heat 
exchange can also be performed in the loop 
via a heat ex changer. If this system presents 
many advantages (Nordkvist, 2005), it may, 
however, be difficult to apply to filamentous 
fungi fermentation as the shear stress in the 
loop and at the exit of the rotary jet may 
damage the morphology of the fungi and 
thereb y may affect the productivity.

5. VEGETATIVE  GROWTH  
In nature, Aspergilli grow within and on solid 
substrates. A colony can result from a single 
sexual or asexual spore but it may also arise 
after conidia and/or germlings that are in 
close vicinity to each other have fused. It has 
been described that fusion  in A. oryzae, A. 
sojae  and A. tamarii most often occurs within  
conidia (> 80%), while fusions between 
conidia and germlings and fusion of 
germlings are much less frequent (Ishitani & 
Sakaguchi 1956). Colonies can reach a 
diameter in the (sub -) millimeter 
(microcolonies) to centimeter (macro -
colonies) scale depending on the size and the 
composition of the substrate. For instance, 
microcolonies are formed on a wheat kernel, 
whereas macro -colonies can be formed 
within the lobes of a lung . In the laboratory, 
Aspergilli  are routinely grown on agar media 
or in liquid media. On agar medium, 
Aspergilli form radial symmetrical macro -
colonies. The mycelium of A. nidulan s (Lee & Adams 1994) and A. niger extend their 
diameter with approximately 0.25 mm per h 
in excess o f nutrients and at a temperature of 
37 °C and 30 °C, respectively.  
 
6. ASEXUAL DEVELOPMENT  
After a period of vegetative growth, air -
exposed colonies of A. nidulans and A. niger 
form two types of aerial hyphae. One  type is 
quite similar to vegetative hyphae  of these 
aspergilli and  has a diameter of about 2 –3 
μm. The second type of aerial hyphae  has a 
diameter of about 4 –5 and 6 –7 μm in the case 
of A. nidulans and A. niger, respectively.  
 
7. EFFECTS OF SOME ECOLOGICAL 
FACTORS ON THE RATE OF 
GROWTH OF ASPERGILLUS NIGER  
Environmental factors such as humidity and 
temperature plays an important role in 
dispersing fungi spores in air for short and 
long distances and when spores deposited a 
solid or liquid surface and if conditions of

 moisture and food are appropriate, they 
germinate (Bennett, 2010; Goncalves et al., 
2010). Normal indoor conditions such as 
humidity and temperature provide a suitable 
environment for the growth of a wide  range  
of fungal spores (Ababutain, 2011; Li and 
Kendrick, 1995). Few researchers on 
airborne fungi reported the observation of  an 
increase in fungi spore concentration at air 
temperatures between 15 and 25°C and 
relative humidity at 60 -70% (Segvic and 
Pepeljnjak, 2006). Relative humidity and 
temperature ex tremities may result in decreased airborne fungi spore concentration 
(Levetin and Horowitz, 1978).  
Effect of Temperature    
   
Ibtisam (2013) showed that the temperature 
of 30oC favored colony diameter growth for 
aspergillus  niger  and so considered the 
optimum growth temperature. The 
temperature range s for A. niger was wide 
from 10 -40°C. At the temperature of 10°C, A. 
niger is unable to form spores and only the 
mycelium growth has appeared.

 8. EFFECTS OF MEDIA TYPES ON 
THE RATE OF GROWTH OF 
ASPERGILLUS NIGER  
Meera et al ., (2012) carried out an experiment 
to determine the rate of growth of A. niger  on 
four different mediums:  
 Potato Dextrose Agar, PDA  
 Optimised PDA Containing Sucrose 
+ Peptone  
 Czapek’s Dox + Yeast Extract Agar 
(CYA)  
 Lignocellulose Agar (LCA)  
They observed that the hyphae of Aspergillus 
niger were septate and hyaline. Conidial 
heads were radiate initially, splitting into 
columns at maturity. The species was 
biseriate (vesicles produced sterile cells 
known as metulae that support the 
conidiogeno us phialides). Conidiophores 
were long,  smooth, and hyaline, becoming 
darker at the apex and terminating in a 
globose vesicle. Metulae and phialides 
covered the entire vesicle. Conidia were 
brown to black, very rough and globose.  
Rate of Growth of Aspergil lus Niger in 
Simple PDA Medium  
Amongst fungal polyculture, spiral patterns 
of growth were sometimes encountered in the 
colonies of A. niger . Such patterns arise  from 
various causes. For example,  an endogenous 
rhythm of sporulation in Aspergillus niger 
produced a colony which forms an 
Archimedes spiral. It looked like a  black 
powdered dusting  left on PDA. The fungus 
started to develop in small circular patterns 
on the media and appeared as black spotty 
dots. On PDA, the radially expanding 
colonial growth  form of the fungal mycelium 
was most evident, extending from an 
inoculum, on, within and sometimes above 
the substrate, forming a near spherical three -
dimensional colony.  Rate of Growth in Modified /Optimised 
PDA Containing Sucrose+Peptone  
At high nutrien t level 
PDA+dye+sucrose+peptone ), the 
Aspergillus niger colonies formed thick 
layers due to the high nutrient influx. It 
appeared roughening in the colony interface 
at relatively high nutrient levels. At high 
nutrient level, the hyphae  produced densely 
inside the colony. With increasing nutrient 
content, colony shapes became similar to the 
compact morphology. Increasing nutrient 
content increased colony and mycelial 
density. At  low nutrient level, the colonies of 
Aspergillus niger were seen in the form o f 
thin mycelial layers. Hyphae  created 
homogeneously inside the colonized area. 
Dense Aspergillus colonies w ere observed up 
to 10th day of inoculation. As the nutrient 
content in PDA depleted up to  10th day, 
sporulation triggered. Hence on the 10th day 
fungal colonies exhibited maximal spores.  
During development, A. niger extended its 
hyphae into the medium. The various forms 
and patterns of fungal growth were referred 
to as a phenomenon of biologic al self -
organization. Each colony was seen as a 
uniform multicellular structure developing 
radially by growth and branching of 
mycelium. The colony was able to consume 
substrate (carbon source, i.e. sucrose) and to 
produce diffusible metabolites that  could  
suppress other microbial development viz. 
bacteria. Hence fungal colony initiation led to 
suppression of bacterial growth due to 
production of mycotoxins (aflatoxins) in the 
PDA.  The final stage of fungal 
morphogenesis was observed as the 
formation of spo res. Different growth 
patterns were seen arising in colonies of A. 
niger while they were cultivated on 
PDA+sucrose+peptone.  
Rate of Growth in Czapek’s Dox + Yeast 
Extract Agar (CYA)  
Observation shows  that poor or moderate 
fungal sporulation occurred in CYA .

 Okunowo et al. , (2010) also observed least 
sporulation and minimum mycelia growth of 
a fungus on Czapek’s  Dox agar, which  may 
be due to the presence of chloride ion in the 
test medium. Thus,  Czapek’s dox agar 
suppresses the fungal sporulation due to 
presence of chloride ions.  
Rate of Growth in Lignocellulose Agar 
(LCA)  
In the present study, Aspergillus niger 
showed heavy fruiting bodies formation in LCA. Osono and Takeda, (1999) stated that 
LCA because of its low glucose content 
suppresses the overgrowth of fast growing 
species. Thus,  the fast growing Aspergillus 
niger in nature is suppressed by LCA 
medium in comparison to P DA. However, 
the sporulation  enhanced as compared to 
CYA. Hence,  this medium is useful  for

CONCLUSION  
 
The morphological characteristics , 
environmental conditions, mass transfer, 
oxygen and  media components are important 
criteria for fungal culture and study, along 
with important physiological parameters that 
lead to maximum sporulation in fungi. In the 
present investigation, type of culture  media 
and their chemical com positions significantly 
affect  the mycelial growth rate and conidial 
production in Aspergillus niger . Thus, the findings in this work revealed that different 
types of culture media differentially 
influenced the growth, colony c haracter and 
sporulation of the test fungi ( Aspergillus 
niger) . Out of three test media employed in 
the Meera’s study, optimized PDA proved  to 
be most suitable for heavy sporulation, with 
a colony density of 22x103 CFU/ml within 
the study hours, as compare d to 7x103, 8x10 
and 10x103 for CYA, LCA and PDA 
respectively. Therefore, in conclusion the  
optimized media  is the best for growing

Manufacturers of  biofuels and  enzymes such 
as alpha amylase, glucoamylase, glucose
