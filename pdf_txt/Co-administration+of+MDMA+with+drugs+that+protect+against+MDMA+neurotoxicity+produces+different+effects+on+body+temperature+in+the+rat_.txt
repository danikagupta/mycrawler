The amphetamine derivative 3,4-methylenedioxymetham-
phetamine (MDMA) is a drug of abuse and has been shown tobe neurotoxic to 5-HT terminals in many species. MDMA-engendered neurotoxicity has been shown to be affected byboth ambient temperature and core body temperature. We nowreport that small (2°C) changes in ambient temperature producechanges in core temperature in MDMA-treated rats, but thesame changes in ambient temperature do not affect core tem-perature of saline-treated animals. Furthermore, increases incore temperature of MDMA-treated animals increase neurotox-icity. Rats were given MDMA (20 or 40 mg/kg) or saline andplaced in an ambient temperature of 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30°Cusing a novel temperature measurement apparatus that con-trols ambient temperature 60.5°C. Two weeks after MDMA
treatment, the rats were killed, and regional 5-HT and5-hydroxyindole acetic acid levels were analyzed as a measureof neurotoxicity. Rats treated with MDMA at 20 and 22°C
showed a hypothermic core temperature response. Treatmentwith MDMA at 28 and 30°C produced a hyperthermic response.At ambient temperatures of 20–24°C, neurotoxicity was notobserved in the frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, hip-pocampus, or striatum. At ambient temperatures of 26–30°C,neurotoxicity was seen and correlated with core temperature inall regions examined. These data indicate that ambient temper-ature has a signiﬁcant affect on MDMA neurotoxicity, coretemperature, and thermoregulation in rats. This ﬁnding hasimplications on both the temperature dependence of the mech-anism of MDMA neurotoxicity and human use because fatalhyperthermia is associated with MDMA use in humans.

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a substituted
amphetamine that is abused (Steele et al., 1994) and has beenshown to be neurotoxic to the 5-HT system in a number of species(Commins et al., 1987b; Schmidt, 1987). Evidence indicatingMDMA neurotoxicity includes decreases in tryptophan hydrox-
ylase (Stone et al., 1988), decreases in 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5- HIAA) levels (Schmidt et al., 1986), decreases in
5-HT uptake sites (Battaglia et al., 1988), and evidence of 5-HTterminal degeneration (Commins et al., 1987b; O’Hearn et al.,1988).
A current line of research is the relationship between core body
temperature (CORE TEMP) and neurotoxicity engendered byMDMA and other amphetamines. Nash et al. (1988) ﬁrst re-ported that MDMA-treated rats became hyperthermic. It wasshown later that prevention of MDMA-induced hyperthermiaprevents neurotoxicity, and that many drugs that protect againstMDMA-induced neurotoxicity lower the CORE TEMP of theanimals (Farfel and Seiden, 1995a; Malberg et al., 1996). Farfel etal. (1995b) have correlated protection against MDMA- andmethamphetamine (METH)-induced neurotoxicity with a de-crease in CORE TEMP, indicating that cooling of the body andprevention of MDMA- or METH-induced hyperthermia pre-
vents neurotoxicity.
The ambient temperature (AMB TEMP) during MDMA or
METH administration also affects CORE TEMP and neurotox-icity (Ali et al., 1994; Miller and O’Callaghan, 1994). A coldAMB TEMP produces hypothermia in both MDMA- andMETH-treated rats and protects against MDMA- and METH-induced neurotoxicity (Bowyer et al., 1993, 1994). The conversealso occurs; administration of MDMA in a warm environmentincreases CORE TEMP (Gordon et al., 1991), and METH-treated rats show increased neurotoxicity at higher AMB TEMPs(Bowyer et al., 1994).
This increase or decrease in CORE TEMP as determined by
AMB TEMP indicates that MDMA may compromise thermo-regulatory ability, i.e., the ability to maintain a normal CORETEMP. This is of clinical interest because lethalities or compli-cations caused by MDMA are often accompanied by hyperther-
mia (Henry, 1992; McCann et al., 1996). Because MDMA isoften taken at “rave parties,” where dancing takes place in a warmenvironment (Green et al., 1995), this strongly suggests that theaffect of MDMA on thermoregulation extends to humans inthese circumstances (McCann et al., 1996).
To date, no precise study of the interaction between tempera-
ture and MDMA-induced neurotoxicity has been performed.Two major difﬁculties in performing these studies are the precisecontrol of AMB TEMP and noninvasive measurement of CORETEMP, because handling the rats can affect core temperature upto 1°C (Gordon, 1993). To address these problems, we developeda novel temperature measurement apparatus that (1) maintains

The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction of
AMB TEMP, CORE TEMP, and MDMA-induced 5-HT neu-rotoxicity. Twenty or 40 mg/kg MDMA was administered to ratsin controlled AMB TEMPs of 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30°C; 2weeks later, regional brain 5-HT and 5- HIAA levels were ana-
lyzed to assess neurotoxicity. A preliminary presentation of thiswork has been made in abstract form (Malberg and Seiden, 1996).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
One hundred forty-six male Holtzman (Madison, WI) rats were used,
each weighing ;250–300 gm at time of injection. Rats were group-
housed (four to ﬁve per cage) in plastic cages with a room temperatureof 22–24°C, except on the drug injection days, when they were housedindividually in the temperature measurement apparatus at differentAMB TEMPs (see Temperature measurement apparatus and Experi-mental procedure below). Throughout the experiment, rats had access tofood (Teklab Diet) and water ad libitum and were maintained on a 12 hr
light/dark cycle. Housing and experimental treatment of the rats were inaccordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.
Drugs
(6)-3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine HCl was obtained from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse. Ketamine and xylazine were obtainedfrom Abbott Labs (Chicago, IL). All chemicals used were of analyticalgrade. Drug dosages are expressed as the weight of the salt, and drugswere dissolved in 0.9% NaCl.
Temperature measurement apparatus
A novel temperature measurement chamber was developed. This consistsof an arrangement of components (computer, computer interface cards,AMB TEMP and CORE TEMP temperature sensors, housing chamber,and Visual Basic software) that forms an integrated system to performthe following functions: (1) measure and maintain a constant AMBTEMP (any temperature from 5 to 45°C, 60.5°C) using a feedback
system that monitors AMB TEMP on a minute-to-minute basis; and (2)measure CORE TEMP once per minute in freely moving animals.
The temperature chambers are modiﬁed refrigerators (0.20 cubic
meters) that have a 1-inch-thick Plexiglas window in the door to allowobservation of the rats and to keep the light/dark cycle in synchrony withrat housing light sources. The rat is unrestrained and allowed to movefreely within a cage (20.3 cm wide, 15.2 cm high, and 16.5 cm deep) insidethe chamber. The cage is large enough to allow the rat to circle, rear, andshow exploratory locomotion. The cage has a hardware cloth (1.3 cmmesh) ﬂoor, top, and back wall to ensure air ﬂow within the cage and hasa Plexiglas door and side walls. Each refrigerator has been modiﬁed sothat in addition to a compressor to cool the chamber, there is also a stripheater and a fan to ensure that the AMB TEMP is even throughout thechamber. A thermistor to record AMB TEMP is mounted in the cham-ber 10.2 cm from the rat cage. To measure CORE TEMP, atemperature-sensitive transmitter (Minimitter Co., Sunriver, OR) thatemits an AM radio signal proportional to the CORE TEMP of the rat isimplanted in the peritoneal cavity of the rat. Four AM radios (RadioShack) surrounding the outside of the rat cage receive signals from thetransmitter.
The heating and cooling elements, thermistor, and CORE TEMP
radio receivers are interfaced to a standard microcomputer (33 MHz,386 DX), which has an analog-to-digital interface allowing the environ-mental and CORE TEMPs to be recorded. Both CORE TEMP andAMB TEMP readings are recorded once per second and then averagedto produce one reading per minute.
The computer also has digital output lines that turn the compressor or
heater off and on inside the chamber. To maintain AMB TEMP, theheating or cooling is turned on or off as necessary to maintain the desiredAMB TEMP 60.5°C. This monitoring of AMB TEMP is done every
minute. In addition to monitoring AMB TEMP, the software can also beprogrammed to prevent the rat from reaching lethal hyperthermia. If therat CORE TEMP increases over a certain temperature point (set by theexperimenter), the AMB TEMP decreases until the rat CORE TEMPdrops below that point. The entire system is run by a novel Visual Basiccomputer program. Eight temperature chambers are used and run inde-
pendently of each other, allowing up to eight different experiments to berun at the same time.
The use of minimitters to measure rat CORE TEMP has been dem-
onstrated as valid and reliable (Dilsaver et al., 1992). The minimittershave a resolution of 60.01°C (Clement et al., 1989).
Surgery
To implant the CORE TEMP transmitters, rats were anesthetized with
ketamine (0.6 mg/ml; 1 ml/kg) and xylazine (100 mg/ml; 0.33 ml/kg) andwere given supplemental 1 ml injections of ketamine as needed. Amidline cut was made in the peritoneum, and a sterilized transmitter wasinserted into the peritoneal cavity, as described by Farfel and Seiden(1995a). Rats were allowed a minimum o f3dt o recover from the
surgeries before drug injections.
Experimental procedure
Parametric experiment: effect of different AMB TEMPs on CORE TEMPand neurotoxicity. At 9:00 A.M., rats were placed in the temperature
measurement chamber at an AMB TEMP of 24°C (the usual AMBTEMP in the laboratory) for a baseline CORE TEMP measurement andto prevent any hyperthermia induced by exploratory locomotion frominterfering with the effects of the drug. After 1 hr, the AMB TEMP wasset at one of the following: 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30°C. Once the chamberreached the desired AMB TEMP, rats were given a subcutaneousinjection of MDMA (20 or 40 mg/kg) or saline (SAL; 1 ml/kg). The ratsremained at that AMB TEMP for 24 hr after the injection. After 24 hr,the rats were returned to their group-housing conditions. Two weeksafter the injection, the rats were killed by decapitation, and the followingregions were dissected, as described by Sabol et al. (1996): frontal cortex,somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Tissue sections werestored in liquid nitrogen until ready for neurochemical analysis.
Heating experiment: effect of hyperthermia on neurotoxicity. In a sepa-
rate experiment to investigate the effect of hyperthermia on 5-HT,5-HIAA, dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA), dihydroxyphenyl
acetic acid (DOPAC), and norepinephrine (NE) levels, saline-treatedrats were placed in the temperature chamber at 24°C for 1 hr to establisha baseline CORE TEMP. The AMB TEMP was then either increased to40°C or remained at 24°C. The rats remained at that AMB TEMP (24 or40°C) for 8 hr. For rats exposed to 40°C AMB TEMP, we preventedlethality by keeping the rat CORE TEMP at #41°C. This maximum
CORE TEMP was chosen because it has been reported that a CORETEMP over 41.3°C in amphetamine-treated rats produces lethal hyper-thermia and heatstroke (Bowyer et al., 1994). To keep rat CORE TEMPat#41°C, the AMB TEMP was kept at 40°C unless the rat CORE
TEMP exceeded 41°C. At that point, the AMB TEMP was automaticallydecreased until the rat CORE TEMP was ,41°C. When the rat was
,41°C CORE TEMP, the AMB TEMP was again increased to 40°C.
Two weeks after this treatment, rats were killed by decapitation, and thefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortex were dissected as describedabove.
Neurochemical assays
5-HT, 5-HIAA, DA, HVA, DOPAC, and NE in the var ious rat brain
regions were assayed by HPLC with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC) according to the method of Sabol et al. (1996) and Kotake (1985).
Core temperature analysis
The CORE TEMP data were quantiﬁed by using an area under the curveanalysis. For each rat, a CORE TEMP versus time graph was generated,and the area between each CORE TEMP versus time curve and y50
was calculated using a trapezoidal area under the curve analysis. In thisway, the CORE TEMP response of each rat could be quantiﬁed andassigned a number value so that the CORE TEMP data could beanalyzed using inferential statistics. This area under the curve value wasdenoted as the “total CORE TEMP” response for each rat. The CORETEMP responses for all rats in each experimental group ( n58) were
summed together so that statistical analysis could be performed. Thisarea under the curve value more accurately reﬂects the CORE TEMPchanges over time for all the groups as opposed to using the mean CORETEMP for each group (Clement et al., 1989; Dilsaver et al., 1990).
Statistics
For neurotoxicity data, differences were determined by ANOVA fol-lowed by a Tukey post hoc test (Instat for Macintosh computers, Graph-Malberg and Seiden •Temperature and MDMA-Induced Neurotoxicity J. Neurosci., July 1, 1998, 18(13):5086–5094 5087Pad). For the CORE TEMP analysis, two-way ANOVA for repeated
measures was used to compare treatment groups (SuperAnova). Single-time point comparisons between groups were made using a Tukey post
hoc test. Statistical signiﬁcance was considered to be p,0.05 unless
indicated othe rwise.
RESULTS
Parametric experiment: effects of MDMA and different
AMB TEMPs on rat CORE TEMP
Each rat was given SAL or MDMA (20 or 40 mg/kg) at one of six
different AMB TEMPs of 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30°C. For all rats,a 1 hr baseline CORE TEMP was recorded. In that time, theaverage CORE TEMP was 37.8 60.05°C. After the baseline
hour the AMB TEMP was adjusted, and animals were injectedwith MDMA or SAL in the different AMB TEMPs.
There were no effects on CORE TEMP in any of the SAL-
treated rats at any of the six different AMB TEMPs. The averageCORE TEMP for all SAL-treated rats ( n548) was 37.3 6
0.07°C for the entire 24 hr spent in the temperature measurementapparatus. This indicates that AMB TEMPs of 20–30°C do notaffect the CORE TEMP of SAL-treated animals. In contrast,MDMA-treated animals had a markedly different CORE TEMPproﬁle in different AMB TEMPs. MDMA administration inAMB TEMPs of 20 and 22°C produced a hypothermia comparedwith SAL controls. MDMA administration in AMB TEMPs of28–30°C produced a hyperthermia compared with SAL controls(Table 1; Fig. 1 A–F ). Both SAL- and MDMA-treated rats re-
turned to a CORE TEMP of 37.5 60.01°C by 11 hr (660 min)
after the MDMA was injected. For this reason, all ﬁgures andstatistical analysis of the CORE TEMP results include only theﬁrst 11 hr of the experiment.
The effects of incrementally higher AMB TEMPs on CORE
TEMPs can be readily seen for each dose (Fig. 2 A,B). Taken
together, these data indicate that small (2°C) changes in AMBTEMP affect the CORE TEMP of the rat and that the ability ofthe rats to thermoregulate is impaired when given 20 or 40 mg/kgMDMA.
Effects of different AMB TEMPs on MDMA-induced
5-HT neurotoxicity
The effect of different AMB TEMPs on MDMA-induced neu-
rotoxicity is shown in Figures 3 and 4. In this experiment, de-creases in 5-HT and 5- HIAA levels were measured as indicatorsof neurotoxicity; we have found this to be a reliable marker of
MDMA neurotoxicity (Lew et al., 1996; Sabol et al., 1996).
There were no signiﬁcant depletions of 5-HT at AMB TEMPs
of 20, 22, or 24°C in any of the brain regions examined. As AMBTEMP increased above 24°C, signiﬁcant depletions were seen,with higher AMB TEMPs inducing greater depletions. At 26°C,there were signiﬁcant depletions of 5-HT compared with controlin the frontal cortex (87% of control) ( p,0.05 for all post hoc
tests), hippocampus (80%), and striatum (72%) in the 40 mg/kggroup and in the somatosensory cortex in both the 20 and 40mg/kg groups (90 and 82%, respectively) (see Figures 3 and 4 forFvalues).
At 28°C, there were signiﬁcant 5-HT depletions compared with
control in the frontal cortex (75% of control) in the 40 mg/kggroup. All other regions had depletions in both the 20 and 40mg/kg group: somatosensory cortex, 80 and 66%, respectively;hippocampus, 75 and 65%, respectively; and striatum, 71 and
61%, respectively.
At 30°C, both the 20 kg and 40 mg/kg MDMA-treated groups
had decreases in 5-HT levels compared with control in all regionsexamined: somatosensory cortex, 70 and 65%, respectively; hip-pocampus, 58 and 42%, respectively; frontal cortex, 63 and 70%,respectively; and striatum, 74 and 66%, respectively.
The 5-HIAA level data were very similar to the 5-HT levels
data; treatment at 20 and 22°C AMB TEMP produced nochanges in 5- HIAA levels, and higher AMB TEMPs produced
decreases in 5- HIAA levels. The one difference was that at 24°C,
5-HIAA levels were affected, whereas 5-HT levels were not
affected until the AMB TEMP reached 26°C. At 24°C AMBTEMP, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in 5- HIAA levels com-
pared with control in the 40 mg/kg group in the frontal cortex(72.7% of control), somatosensory cortex (77%), and hippocam-pus (79%).
At 26°C AMB TEMP, the 40 mg/kg group showed signiﬁcant
depletions compared with 5- HIAA depletions to control in the
frontal cortex (70% of control), hippocampus (79%), and striatum(64%).
Treatment at 28°C AMB TEMP produced decreases in
5-HIAA levels compared with control in the 40 mg/kg group in
all regions: somatosensory cortex, 69% of control; hippocampus,72%; frontal cortex, 70%; and striatum, 64%.Table 1. Maximum and minimum CORE TEMP and area-under-the-curve (AUC) values for all treatment groups 10 hr after injection

A signiﬁcant effect of treatment on total core temperature changes [area under the curve (AUC)] is seen at AMB TEMPs of 20 ( F56.80; p,0.0001), 22 ( F512.15; p,
0.0010), 28 ( F55.36, p,0.0143), and 30°C ( F59.85; p,0.001). At 20°C, both the 20 and 40 mg/kg groups had signiﬁcant decreases in CORE TEMP. At 22°C, only the
20 mg/kg group had a signiﬁcant decrease in CORE TEMP. Treatment at 24 and 26°C did not produce an overall effect of CORE TEMP change, although the 40 mg/k g
rats at 26°C seemed to have a hyperthermic peak temperature. At 28°C, only the 40 mg/kg group had a signiﬁcantly higher CORE TEMP response than the SAL gr oup, and
at 30°C, both the 20 and 40 mg/kg groups had signiﬁcantly higher CORE TEMP response.

treated groups had signiﬁcant decreases in 5- HIAA levels in all
regions: somatosensory cortex, 70 and 73%, respectively; hip-pocampus, 58 and 56%, respectively; frontal cortex, 63 and 60%,respectively; and striatum, 54 and 70%, respectively.
These results clearly indicate that at 20–24°C, there is protec-
tion against MDMA-induced decreases in 5-HT levels, and at20–22°C there is protection against 5- HIAA decreases. At 26–
28°C there is increased neurotoxicity, and by 28–30°C all treat-ment groups are signiﬁcantly affected. These results point to alarge effect of AMB TEMP in determination of MDMA-inducedneurotoxicity.
Correlation between AMB TEMP and neurotoxicity
Regression analysis was used to determine a correlation betweenthe area under the curve and neurotoxicity (decrease in 5-HT and5-HIAA levels) in all MDMA-treated animals. All regions had
signiﬁcant negative correlations (Table 2) for both 5-HT and5-HIAA levels. These data indicate that as the CORE TEMP of
animals treated with MDMA increases above a normal CORETEMP, 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels decrease.
Lethality
In the parametric experiment, lethality was not prevented as it
was in the heating experiment so that the percentage of lethalityfor each AMB TEMP-dose combination could be determined. Inthe 40 mg/kg 30°C AMB TEMP group, we obtained 20% lethal-ity. This is less lethality than Gordon et al. (1991) obtained at the
same AMB TEMP. This may be attributable to the fact that inour temperature measurement chamber, there was a constantmovement of air because of the fan, so that any lethality attrib-utable to additional humidity was attenuated in our temperaturechamber.
Effect of hyperthermia on SAL-treated rats
Saline-treated rats in an AMB TEMP of 24°C had an averageCORE TEMP of 37.4 60.02°C, and saline-treated rats treated at
an AMB TEMP of 40°C had an average CORE TEMP of 39 6
0.08°C, with a peak CORE TEMP of 40.89°C. There was asigniﬁcant difference ( p,0.0001) in CORE TEMP response
between the rats treated at 24 and 40°C, indicating that an AMBTEMP of 40°C produces hyperthermia in SAL-treated rats.Twenty-four hours after the rats were placed in the temperaturemeasurement apparatus, all rats had average CORE TEMPs of37.560.03°C.
There was no change in any neurotransmitter level (5-HT,
5-HIAA, DA, DOPAC, HVA, and NE) bet ween the rats treated
at 24 and 40°C AMB TEMP in all of the brain regions examined.In the interest of space, only the frontal cortex and somatosensorycortex data are shown (Fig. 5 A,B). This indicates that the signif-
icant CORE TEMP hyperthermia induced by a 40°C AMBTEMP causes no changes in neurotransmitter levels. This is in
Figure 1. CORE TEMP versus time responses for rats treated at AMB TEMP of 20 ( A), 22 ( B), 24 ( C), 26 ( D), 28 ( E), and 30°C ( F) for 660 min
(11 hr) after injection. All rats were injected at time 0 with 1 ml/kg SAL, 20 mg/kg MDMA, or 40 mg/kg MDMA at the indicated AMB TEMP. Ratswere placed in the temperature-controlled chamber for 1 hr before injection for baseline measurements. n58 for all experimental groups. All values

induced fever on 5-HT levels and found no signiﬁcant effect.
This control experiment demonstrates that the changes in
neurotransmitter levels seen in our MDMA experiment are notattributable to the CORE TEMP hyperthermia alone but areattributable to the CORE TEMP hyperthermia interacting withthe MDMA. The hyperthermia itself does not cause depletions inneurotransmitter levels.
DISCUSSION
The main ﬁnding of this study is that a small (2°C) change inAMB TEMP produces marked changes in both CORE TEMPand MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity. Although previousstudies (Gordon et al., 1991; Bowyer et al., 1994; Miller andO’Callaghan, 1994) have demonstrated that large changes inAMB TEMP affect CORE TEMP and neurotoxicity, the presentstudy is the ﬁrst to investigate the effect of small controlledchanges in AMB TEMP. We demonstrate that MDMA disruptsthermoregulatory ability, and this in turn makes the CORETEMP dependent on the AMB TEMP. The resulting changes inCORE TEMP affect MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. This studyunderscores the importance of a constant and controlled AMB
TEMP in any experimental paradigm investigating MDMAneurotoxicity.
It can be seen that above 24°C degrees AMB TEMP, changes
in AMB TEMP increase the neurotoxicity. We hypothesize thatthere is a critical AMB TEMP, which we term “break point,”below which protection is seen. Increases in AMB TEMP fromthis point increase MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. The breakpoint for a single dose of 20 or 40 mg/kg MDMA seems to be24°C, although most likely this break point is different for otherMDMA doses and amphetamine analogs and may differ indifferent-sized animals and species.
It is of interest that at 24°C AMB TEMP, 5- HIAA levels are
decreased, whereas 5-HT levels are not affected until 26°C AMB
TEMP. It may be that the decrease in 5- HIAA levels near the
break point is indicative of partial damage to cellular metabolism,although further research is needed to determine its extent andcharacterization.
MDMA and other amphetamines have been shown to disrupt
thermoregulation in both rats and humans (Gordon et al., 1991;

thermoregulation in rats has been shown to occur not only inneurotoxic doses (Gordon et al., 1991; Gordon and Fogelson,1994) but also in non-neurotoxic doses (Dafters, 1994; Ainsworthet al., 1997). This has received much attention because of thenumber of MDMA-related fatalities that have involved hyper-thermia and heatstroke (Henry, 1992; Dar and McBrien, 1996).Many, but not all, of these overdoses arise from MDMA use atrave parties (Green et al., 1995; McCann et al., 1996). The use ofMDMA or other amphetamines combined with high AMBTEMP seen at rave parties and hyperthermia induced by dancing
(Sternbach, 1991) may all contribute to the hyperthermia-associated problems with MDMA use.
The MDMA-induced hyperthermia has been theorized to be
linked to the “serotonin syndrome” (Ames and Wirshing, 1993;Friedman, 1993). This syndrome consists of hyperthermia andother symptoms (Sternbach, 1991) and is thought to result fromexcess 5-HT at the 5-HT1
Areceptor (Ames and Wirshing, 1993;
Sporer, 1995). Given that MDMA induces 5-HT release, it hasbeen theorized that there is a link between MDMA-induced

Wirshing, 1993; Friedman, 1993). This has been supported bystudies in the rat in which 5-HT syndrome behaviors such asforepaw treading, head weaving, and a low body posture wereinduced by MDMA administration (Spanos and Yamamoto,1989; Colado et al., 1993). These behaviors increased in intensityand duration of response with increasing doses of MDMA (Spa-nos and Yamamoto, 1989).
Our study indicates that MDMA-induced hyperthermia leads
to neurotoxicity. We hypothesize that once MDMA enters theneuron via the 5-HT transporter (Rudnick and Wall, 1992), thehyperthermia would then affect and possibly increase the rate ofreactions leading to MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. In support ofthis, we (Malberg et al., 1996) have shown that if MDMA isprevented from entering the 5-HT neuron by ﬂuoxetine pretreat-ment, the rats still display hyperthermia, although no neurotox-icity is seen. Under these circumstances, the hyperthermia may befrom MDMA stimulating 5-HT
2A/C receptors. DOI and M-CPP,
selective agonists to 5-HT2A/C and 5-HT2Creceptors, respec-
tively, have been shown to produce a hyperthermia (M azzola-
Pomietto et al., 1997), and MDMA has been shown to act as anagonist to 5-HT
2Aand 5-HT2Creceptors (Nash et al., 1994). This
5-HT2A/C-mediated hyperthermia could contribute to the neuro-
toxicity observed.
In contrast to hyperthermia increasing reactions leading to
neurotoxicity, hypothermia may also protect by decreasing therate of reactions leading to MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. Acold AMB TEMP has been shown to protect against neurotox-icity (Bowyer et al., 1993; Ali et al., 1994; Che et al., 1995), andmany drugs that protect against neurotoxicity do so by loweringthe rats’ CORE TEMP (Bowyer et al., 1994; Miller andO’Callaghan, 1994; Farfel and Seiden, 1995a,b; Malberg et al.,1996). Hypothermia has also been shown to be neuroprotective inother models of brain injury (Ginsberg et al., 1992). We hypoth-esize that hypothermia may slow down some of the reactionsleading to METH-induced neurotoxicity. It is not currentlyknown how the hypothermia is produced. In a cold AMB TEMP,the hypothermia may come from an MDMA-induced deﬁcit inthe thermoregulatory system that results in an inability to pro-duce normal heat-conservation or heat-production responses,which would make an animal hypothermic. Further experimentsare necessary to determine how and where MDMA would affect
thermoregulatory responses.
There are several hypothesized mechanisms of neurotoxicity.
For many of the reactions leading to neurotoxicity that have beenexperimentally investigated, hypothermia and hyperthermia mayaffect the rate of reactions. MDMA has been shown to bind to the5-HT transporter (Rudnick and Wall, 1992). It is not knownwhether the CORE TEMP hypothermia or hyperthermia wouldaffect in vivo binding of MDMA to the transporter. It has been
shown, however, that plasma levels of MDMA are not affected byeither a CORE TEMP hypothermia or hyperthermia (Colado etal., 1995) so that MDMA pharmacokinetics are not affected bychanges in CORE TEMP.
Temperature has an affect on amphetamine-induced 5-HT and
DA release, which may be important to neurotoxicity. Clausing etal. (1996) have shown using in vivo microdialysis that
amphetamine-induced striatal DA levels correlate with maximumbrain temperature, indicating that hyperthermia increases

(1992) have reported that a cold AMB TEMP, which lowersCORE TEMP, prevents METH-induced DA and 5-HT release.Changes in CORE TEMP, then, may affect the step ofamphetamine-induced neurotransmitter release.
Free radical formation is hypothesized to be a major reaction
leading to neurotoxicity (Halliwell, 1992; Cadet et al., 1994;Gudelsky, 1996). Therefore, the effect of CORE TEMP on theformation of free radicals may be a major point in preventing orincreasing neurotoxicity. It has been shown that hypothermiaprevents free radical formation; maintaining the brain at a hypo-thermic temperature prevents ischemia-induced 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid formation. Conversely, free radical forma-tion is increased in rats with hyperthermic brain temperature(Globus et al., 1995; Kil et al., 1996). These results show thatformation of hydroxyl radicals in the brain is a temperature-dependent process. In addition, CORE TEMP hypothermiacould decrease and hyperthermia could increase free radicalformation such as 6-OHDA, 5,7-DHT, and NO (Halliwell, 1992).At least some, if not all, of these free radicals are theorized toparticipate in amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity (Seiden andVosmer, 1984; Commins et al., 1987a; Dawson et al., 1993; Cadetet al., 1994).
Activation of excitatory amino acids and Ca
21accumulation
have been implicated in amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity(Sonsalla et al., 1989), and hypothermia may also prevent theaccumulation of calcium ions. Hypothermia reduces glutamateand glycine release (Illievich et al., 1994) and Ca
21accumulation
and release (Corbett et al., 1990; Mitani et al., 1991), and this maycontribute to hypothermic protection against neurotoxicity.
Kramer et al. (1995, 1997) have reported that MDMA induces
translocation of the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent en-zyme PKC and theorize that this prolonged kinase activation maycontribute to the neurotoxicity. Interestingly, it has been reportedthat in hypothermic rats, ischemia-induced translocation of PKCwas completely abolished (Cardell et al., 1991). This again pointsto hypothermia decreasing or preventing another neurotoxicreaction.
Another theory of neurotoxicity has been advanced by Carls-
son (1993), who posits a feed-forward loop that is excited byamphetamines and causes continued release of neurotransmitter.This requires energy, and eventually the cell goes into ATPdepletion and dies. Hypothermia may slow down this reaction; ithas been shown that reduction of brain temperature signiﬁcantlydelays decreases in ATP throughout the hippocampus (Busto etal., 1987; Zeevalk and Nicklas, 1993). Therefore, hypothermicprevention of the ATP depletion may be another mechanism ofprotection against neurotoxicity.
In summary, this experiment used a novel temperature mea-
surement apparatus to measure and control AMB TEMP and tomeasure CORE TEMP. We have shown that small (2°C) changesin AMB TEMP have a large affect on CORE TEMP neurotox-icity in MDMA-treated animals. At low AMB TEMPs hypother-mia and protection against neurotoxicity is seen, and at highAMB TEMPs we report a hyperthermia that correlates withincreased neurotoxicity. This is in line with clinical evidenceindicating reduced thermoregulation and lethality from MDMAuse and 5-HT syndrome, and we offer a hypothesis that thehypothermia and hyperthermia may be acting on one or more ofthe reactions leading to neurotoxicity.REFERENCES
