ABSTRACT:  The present study provides an electrocoagulation process for the adsorption of   2,4 
dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4 -D) from aqueous solution using sacrificial anodes. The effects of operational 
parameters such as initial pH, initial concentration, current den sity, type of electrolyte, salt concentration and 
temperature on the herbicide and COD removal efficiency have been studied. The optimal operating con dition for 
removal of 2,4 -D herbicide were : initial pH of 10, an initial herbicide concentration of 200 m g/L, temperature of 30 
oC, current density (62.5, 12.5 and 37.5 mA/cm2) and salt concentration of 1.5g/L by using Fe, S -S and Al respectively. 
The results showed that the removal percentage for 2,4 -D and COD were (88.7% and 71 %), (94.4% and 74.9%) and 
(93.4 % and 75.3%) by using Fe, S -S and Al electrodes at 60 min respectively. The adsorption equilibriums were 
analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. It was found that the data fitted to Langmuir ( R2 = 0.9970) 
better than Freundlich (R2 = 0.9966 ) model. The removal of 2,4 -D exhibited a pseudo second order reaction with rate 
constant (0.0861, 0.4224 and 0.1903 mol-1dm3 min-1 ) for Fe, S -S and Al electrodes respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
 
During the last several decades, the worldwide use of herbicides  has resulted in residues that have been frequently 
detected in soil systems as well as surface and ground waters [1,2]. One of the most common herbicides  is 2,4 -
Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4 -D) has been proved to be toxic to human , animals  [3-5] and being considered as 
moderately toxic (class II or III) by the World Health Organization  (WHO) . Their widespread use in industrialized and 
developing countries for agri cultural and non -agricultural purposes generates continuously reinstate, waste product and 
contaminated soil at hundreds of thousands of application sites. They are found as pollutants in nat ural waters; with 
contamination levels up to 10 –30 mg/ L in ground  and surface water  resulting millions of people are affected [ 6]. For 
this reason, there is great interest in the development of environmentally clean methods to destroy such compounds in 
aqueous medium for avoiding their dangerous accumulation in the aqua tic environment. Many conventional methods 
have been successfully applied for the efficient removal of 2,4 -D from  water sources , such  as adsorption [7]  , advanced 
oxidation  [8], photo Fenton [9] , UV/H 2O2  [10,11]  , UV/Ti O [12,13]  and  biological treatmen t [14] .  In recent years, 
novel methods for water purification have been developed including chemical, electrochemical and pho tochemical 
processes [ 15,16]. Electrochemical processes (electrolysis and electrocoagulation) have been successfully demonstrat ed 
for removing pollutants in various industrial wastewaters [1 7,18].  Removal mechanisms reported in the electrolysis 
process generally include oxidation, reduction, decomposition, whereas the mechanisms in the electrocoagulation 
process include coagulation,  adsorption,  precipitation and flotation [1 9,20]. Electrocoagulation is a low cost process 
and efficient method for the treatment of water and wastewater. It was tested successfully to treat drinking water 
[21,22], aquacultural wastewater [23], textile wa stewater [24,25], industrial wastewater [26,27], landfill leachate [2 8]. 
It was also used to remove phenol [2 9] and surfactants [3 0] from industrial wastewaters.  Although electrochemical 
coagulation has been utilized for over a century, the available liter ature reveals little studies on the removal of

This work aims to study the possibility of using different sacrificial anodes for adsorption of (2,4-D) herbicides from 
aqueous solution by electrocoagulation method.  
 
II. EXPERIMENT  
 
A. Chemicals  
 
The herbicides used in the present work was (2,4-D) solutions  which were prepared from the co mmercially available 
herbicide at a concentration of 335 g L−1 from (Mkhchim  ). This concentration is the same as that used by farmers  
during strawberry cultivation. The properties of the (2,4-D) is given in Table 1. Sodium chloride, calcium chl oride, 
potassium chloride, potassium fluoride , sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, were of analytical 
grade and purchased from Merck. Distilled water was used for the preparation of solutions. Standard solutions of 
potassium dichromate ( K2Cr2O7), sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) reagent with silver sulfate (Ag 2SO 4), Mercury  sulfate (HgSO 4) 
and  were prepared to measure the COD. A stock solution of herbicide  (1000 mg/L) was prepared by dissolving an 
accurate quantity of the herbicide in distilled wat er and suitably diluted to the required initial concentrations. Different 
standard solutions of herbicide with concentration from 50 –250 mg L-1 were prepared to measure its removal at 
different conditions. The pH of the working solution was adjusted to the  desired values with 0.1N HCl or 0.1N NaOH.  
 
B. Equipments and procedures  
 
The electrocoagulation unit consisted of an 100 ml electrochemical reactor with  stainless steel , iron and aluminum 
electrodes  (anode and cathode) with an effective surface area of 4 cm2 . The electrodes were 20 mm×10 mm and inter 
electrodes distance was 1 cm. The electrodes were positioned vertically and parallel to each other .  The current density 
was maintained constant by means of a precision DC power supply, model (DZ040019) EZ Digital  CO. Ltd. (Korea). 
The herbicide concentration was determined using a double - beam  UV -Vis  spectrophotometer, model UV 1601 is 
from Shimadzu (Japan)  at 284 nm. Hot Plate , model (HB502), BIBBY STERILIN LTD .(U.K.)  .  A pH meter model

titrimetric unit was used for the COD determination. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) , HANNA instrument s 
,Thermo reactor , model C9800  Reactor in Hungary – Europe .   
 
C. Analysis  
  
Two main parameters were measured to evaluate the electrochemical treatment efficiency, the remainin g pollutant 
concentration and the COD. Remaining pollutants (2,4-D) concentration was measured with the double -beam UV -
visible sp ectrophotometer at λ max=284 nm using calibration curve with standard error ±0.5%. The COD was determined 
using a closed reflux colorimetric method [36]. The equation used to calculate the herbicide removal efficiency in the 
treatment experiments was:                                           
 %E =[ (A 0 - A) / A 0 ]× 100                                                                                                              (1)                                                   
Where A0 and A are absorbanc e values of herbicides solutions before and after treatment with respect to their λ max [37]

The calculation of COD removal efficiencies  after electrocoagulation treatment were performed using  the following 
formula [38] .

The chemistry behind the EC process in water in such that the positively charged ions are attracted to the negatively 
charged hydroxides ions producing ionic hydroxides with a strong tendency to attract s uspended particles leading to 
coagulation.  
 
(ii) Effect of current density (mA/cm2)  
 
The current density determines the coagulant dosage rate. This parameter should have a significant i mpact on the 
removal efficiency of the herbicide . To examine the effe ct of current density on 2,4 -D and COD removal efficiency, a 
series of experiments were carried out with the current density ranging from ( 12.5 - 62.5 mA/cm2) at a pH of 10, initial 
concentration of 200 mg/L, inter -electrode distance of 1 cm, NaCl concent ration of 1.5 g/L and temperature of 30 oC. 
Figure  (1) and Table (2) show  the optimum current densities were 62.5 mA/cm2, 12.5 mA/cm2 and 37.5 mA/cm2 for 
Fe, S -S and Al electrodes respectively. The removal efficiencies of 2,4 -D were 85.4%, 94.4% and 93.4% while the 
COD removal efficiencies were 70.3%, 73% and 72.2% using Fe, S -S and Al electrodes at 60 min respectively.  
The increase of coagulant and bubbles generation rate lead to the increase number of H 2 bubbles and decrease their size 
with increasing cur rent density resulting in a faster removal of herbicides  [48, 49, 50, 51] . Further increase in current 
density above optimal condition did not lead to an increase in herbicide and COD removal efficiencie s. But the 
sufficient amount of flocs needed to coagu late the herbicide might be available at optimal current density and further 
formation of flocs which did not change herbicide and COD removal efficiency  [52].  
 
(iii)  Effect of initial pH  
 
pH is an important operating factor influencing the performance of  the electrocoagulation process [40]. A series of 
experiments were carried out to evaluate effect of initial pH using solutions containing a sample wi th an initial pH

varying in the range ( 2 -10 ) at initial concentration of 2,4 -D 200 mg/L, inter electrode  distance of 1 cm, NaCl 
concentration of 1.5 g/L , temperature of 30 oC and current density of 62.5 mA/cm2, 12.5 mA/cm2 and 37.5 mA/cm2 for 
Fe, S -S and Al electrodes respectively  at time 60 min . Figure (2) and Table (2) display that the removal efficiencies  of 
the 2,4 -D and COD were low in acidic medium, meanwhile, in neutral and alkaline medium the removal efficienc ies 
were much higher using all working electrodes  due to the formation of metal hydroxide  species which adsorb the 
herbicide molecules and cause s the increase of the removal efficiency [41] . 
The percentage removal increased by increasing pH. It was observed that below pH 5.8 there was decre asing trend in 
adsorption, this may be due to:  
1. In case of iron anode the oxidation of ferrous iron Fe (II) t o ferric iron Fe (III) diminishes, resulting decreased 
removal efficiency in acidic pH values. Neutral and slightly alkaline pH, however, tends to favor Fe (II) to Fe(III) 
oxidation as well as complex polymerization. Finally, hydroxylated colloidal polymers  and an insoluble precipitate 
of hydrated ferric oxide were formed and the removal efficiency was increased. The decrease of remov al efficiency 
when the pH is higher than 10, and more acidic was observed by many investigators  [57] and was attributed to an 
amphoteric behavior of M(OH) 3 which leads to soluble metal cations (at acidic pH) and to monomeric anions (at 
alkaline pH).  
2. In case of aluminum anode the removal efficiency of the herbicide and COD is high in neutral and mod erate 
alkaline electrolyte. The decrease of removal efficiency at more acidic and alkaline pH was observed by many 
investigators  [53, 54]  and was attributed to an amphoteric behavior of Al(OH) 3 which leads to soluble Al3+ cations 
(at acidic pH) and to monomeric anions Al (OH)-
4 (at alkal ine pH). It is well known that these soluble species are 
not useful for water treatment. When the initial pH was kept in neutral, all the aluminum produced a t the anode 
formed polymeric species Al 13O4(OH)7+
24) and precipitated as Al(OH) 3 leading to more re moval efficiency [54]. 
(iv) Effect of initial 2,4 -D concentration (mg/L)  
 
Effect of the initial concentration on removal efficiencies of 2,4 -D and COD by EC was investigated in the range of 50 
to 250 mg/L, at time 60 min, pH of 10, inter -electrode distance  of 1 cm, NaCl concentration of 1.5 g/L , temperature of 
30 oC and current densities of 62.5, 12.5 and 37.5 mA/cm2 using Fe, S -S and Al electrodes respectively. From Figure 
(3) and Table (2) it may be seen that increasing initial 2,4 -D concentration  above 2 00 mg/L   results decreas the 
adsorption  because the amount of produced flocs is insufficient to adsorb all herbicide molecules.  
According to Faraday’s law, a constant amount of metal hydroxides is dissolved from the Fe, S -S and Al anode and 
passes to the solution for the same current density and electrolysis time for herbicides concentrations. Consequen tly, the 
same amount of metal hydroxides is produced in the aqueous solution. This is probably why the amount  of hydroxyl and 
metal ions produced on the ele ctrodes was not sufficient to adsorb at high  2,4-D concentrations at a constant current 
density.   
 
 
  (v) Effect of temperature (oC) 
 
The effect of temperature on the removal of pollutants through EC has been studied in a few articles . Effect of 
temperatur e from 10 to 50 oC has been studied for the removal efficiencies of 2,4 -D and COD as shown in Figure (4)  
and Table (2) at time 60 min, initial concentration of 200 mg/L, pH of 10 and NaCl concentration of 1.5 g/L and 
current densities of 62.5, 12.5 and 37. 5 mA/cm2 using Fe, S -S and Al elec trodes respectively. The figure  indicate that 
the 2,4 -D and COD removal efficiencies decrease with increasing temperatures above 30 oC due to the volume of 
colloid M (OH) 3 will decrease and pore production on the metal ano de well be closed [42] . where at 30 °C the herbicide 
removal and COD% reached to maximum.  
 
(vi) Effect of electrolyte concentration (g/L)  
             
To evaluate the effect of the salt concentration on 2,4 -D removal efficiency and COD, different electrolyt e solutions 
were prepared by the addition of different amounts of NaCl varied from (0.5 – 2.5 g/L) at time 60 min, initial

It can be attributed that the incr ease of the conductivity by the addition of sodium chloride is known to reduce the cell 
voltage at constant current density due to the decrease of the ohmic resistance of solution [55] and the produced amount 
of metallic hydroxide this leading to a reducti on of the oxide layer and an enhancement of the anodic dissolution of the 
electrode material and herbicide removal increases  [56]. However, with the increa se in NaCl concentration ˃ 1.5 g/L for 
2,4-D the removal efficiency decreased using all electrode.  
  
(vii)  Effect of type of electrolyte  
 
Figure  (6) and Table (2 ) explain the effect of electrolyte types on the removal efficiencies of 2,4 -D and COD at 60 min, 
pH of 10, at initial concentration of 2,4 -D 200 mg/L, inter -electrode distance of 1 cm, temperature of 30 oC and current 
densities of 62.5, 12.5, 37.5 mA/cm2 using Fe, S -S and Al electrodes respectively. Electrolytes of 1.5 g/L of the 
following salts:  NaCl, KCl, Na 3PO 4, NaF and Na2SO4 were studies by three electrodes. According to Figure ( 6) and 
Table (2) the higher elimination of herbicide  and COD in the presence of  NaCl Due to formation of hypochlorite (OCl-
) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). It is well  known that Cl− anions can destroy the formed passivation layer on electrode 
and therefore enhance anodic dissolution rate of metal which lead to produce more metal hydroxide [4 3]. 
 
B. Analyses of adsorption data . 
 
(i) Kinetic modeling  
 
Kinetics studies ha ve important role in determining the rate constant and the order of reaction of this treatment remov al 
[44].  So, rate constant is very significant in the process of wastewater treatment units. It is very essen tial to know the 
type of reaction rates in the  process. Rate of reaction describes the rates of change in concentration of reactant per unit 
time. Figs. (7)  represent the removal efficiencies of 2,4 -D which exhibit pseudo -second order with using Fe, S -S and 
Al electrodes according to following equati on:  
1/At – 1/Ao = Kt                                                                                                                                  ( 15)  
Where Ao, At, t and K are the 2,4 -D absorbance at initial concentration, 2,4 -D absorbance at each time, time of 
reaction (min), and reaction rate constant respectively. The calculated k values from the plot (straight line) of Figures 7 
were 0.0861, 0.4224 and 0.1903 mol -1dm3min-1 using Fe, S -S and Al electrodes respectively.  
 
(ii) Isotherm modeling  
 
Since the removal of pollutant is similar to conventional adsorption, except the generation of coagula nts, adsorption 
isotherm models can be extended to describe experimental isotherm data and identify the mechanism of  the adsorption 
process. Isotherm models  with two and three parameters have been therefore considered to establish the relationship 
between the amounts of 2,4-D adsorbed onto the methal  hydroxides and its equilibrium concentration in the aqueous 
solution containing 2,4-D. The general forms of bo th these models were described as follows.  
 
The Langmuir equation  
 
This describes quantitatively the formation of a monolayer adsorbate on the outer surface of the ads orbent, and after 
that no further adsorption takes place. Thereby, the Langmuir represent s the equilibrium distribution of metal ions 
between the solid and liquid phases [ 45]. The Langmuir isotherm is valid for monolayer adsorption onto a surface 
containing a finite number of identical sites. The model assumes uniform energies of adsorption on to the surface and no 
transmigration of adsorbate in the plane of the surface. Based upon these assumptions, Langmuir repr esented the 
following equation:  
Ce/qe = 1/q mb +   Ce/qm                                                             (16) 
where qe (mg/ g) is amount adsorbed at equilibrium, Ce (mg/L) equilibrium concentration, qm is the Langmuir consta nt 
representing maximum monolayer adsorption capacity, and b is the Langmuir constant related to energy  of adsorption.  
 
Freundlich Adsorption Isotherm :  
 
This is commonly used to describe the adsorption characteristics for the heterogeneous surface [46]. T hese data often 
fit the empirical equation proposed by Freundlich:

log q e =  log k f   + n log Ce                                                  (17) 
where k f (mg/g) and n (dimensionless) are constants that account for all factors affecting the adsorption pro cess, such as 
the adsorption capacity and intensity. The Freundlich constants K f and n are determined from the intercept and slope, 
respectively, of the linear plot of log qe versus log Ce.  
According the equation (16  and 17) the contaminants are usually adsorbed at the surface of the metal hydroxides 
generated during the electrocoagula tion process. In order to explain the mechanism of the adsorption process, it is 
important to establish the most appropriate correlation for the equilibrium curves. In this study, T wo adsorption 
isotherms (Langmuir and Freundlich) models were applied to es tablish the relationship between the amounts of 2,4 -D 
adsorbed on  to the metal hydroxides and its equilibrium concentration in the electrolyte containing contaminant ions  
[47]. Figures. (8-9) and table 3  represent the Langmuir and Freundlich Isotherms stud ies of equilibrium.  
 
C. Energy consumption  
  
In an electrochemical process, the most important economical parameter is energy consumption E (kWh/ m3). This 
parameter is calculated from the following expression:  
E   =   I V t /  volume . 1000                                                                            (18) 
where V, I and t stand for average voltage of the EC system (V), electrical current intensity (A) an d reaction time (h), 
respectively.  
 
D. Mass of loss from anode electrode  
 
The maximum poss ible mass of  Fe and Al electrochemically generated from sacrificial anodes for a particular electri cal 
current was calculated using Faraday’s law of electrolysis (Mechelhoff et al. 2013):  
m = I.A.M.t / V.Z.F                                                                                                                                 (19) 
where m is the mass of the anode material dissolved (g), I the current density (A m−2), A the active electrode area (m2), 
M the molar mass of the anode material (g mol−1), t electrolysis time (s), V volume of the reactor (m3), z the number of 
electrons transferred, and F the Faraday’s constant (96,485 C mol−1). The maximum possible mass of Fe and Al 
electrochemically generated from sacrificial anodes in table (5) . 
 
E. Dete rmine the residual concentration of iron in herbicides samples  
 
It appears to be more of a nuisance than a potential health hazard. Iron in water 0.1 mg/L for ferro us iron and 0.2 mg/L 
ferric Iron. Water used in industrial processes usually contain less th an 0.2 mg/L iron  [58]. According to following 
equation Beer -lambert:  
A=ε b C                                                                                                                                                    (20) 
Where A is absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, b is the path length of the sample and C is the concentration of the 
compound in solution. The concentration measurements of iron (II) was found 0.059  ppm for 2,4 -D.
