THREE-DIMENSIONAL LIGHT MICROSCOPE WORKSTATION 
FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE CELL 
By 
Yasushi HIRAOKA 
ABSTRACT 
We have developed a high-resolution, three-dimensional light microscope system for the 
non-destructive analysis of three-dimensional dynamics ofliving cells. The system is comprised 
of a fluorescence microscope, a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) and a computer, and allows 
the three-dimensional image data collection, image processing and image analysis to be carried out 
on a single workstation. Substantial improvement in the microscopic resolution has been made by 
computational image processing and it has become possible to analyze small subcellular structures 
in three dimensions. 
1. Introduction 
Light microscopy provides a powerful tool to study structure hfunction relationship of the cell, 
allowing the entire cell to be examined in the living state. Especially molecular specificity of imaging 
in fluorescence microscopy, specific molecules can be selectively visualized within a cell< 1 >. Also 
fluorescent dyes that are dependent on intracellular environments, such as calcium concentration or 
pH, have been developed<2><3>, and the information at the molecular level can be measured within an 
individual cell. 
A microscopic image is basically two-dimensional whereas cellular structures are intrinsically 
three-dimensional. One way to obtain three-dimensional images on a light microscope is to take a set 
of two-dimensional images at different focal planes by stepping a microscope focus and stack them 
together to reconstruct the three-dimensional image (Fig. 1 ). However, a problem to be taken up here 
is that a microscopic image of a three-dimensional object contains not only the true information from 
the infocus plane, but also the out-of-focus information from neighboring regions of the object. This 
is due to the fact that the point light source does not focus onto a single point, but instead is three-
dimensionally spread out by the passage through a microscope. Thus, the out-of focus image 
information contaminates the infocus image. This opticalgbluÎinghof the microscopic image greatly 
reduces the resolution of the microscope. Thus, it is necessary to eliminate the out-of-focus 
information to obtain high resolution three-dimensional images<4>. 
To obtain high-resolution, three-dimensional images from a light microscope, we have developed 
a computer-controlled light microscope system in conjunction with computational image processing. 
This system can perform three-dimensional image data collection, image processing and image 
analysis on a single workstation and enables us to analyze small subcellular structures in three 
dimensions.

2. Three-Dimensional Light Microscope Workstation 
The three-dimensional light microscope system consists of three mDorcomponents: a fluorescent 
microscope, a cooled CCD and a computer that controls the microscope and the CCD (Fig. 2). Three-
dimensional images are taken on the CCD by stepping the microscope focus at constant intervals. 
Focus movement is made by a stepping motor with 50,000 steps per revolution attached to the 
microscope focus knob. The one step in the rotation coÅEesponds to 4 nm in the microscope focus. A 
scientific-grade, cooled CCD is an ideal image detector for the three-dimensional image processing, 
having high geometrical and numerical accuracy(S)(6l. CCD chip is kept at-40C by the Pertier cooling 
to reduce thermal noise. The CCD is, with its high sensitivity and low noise, ideal for the live cell 
observation which requires low levels of illumination. 
Fluorescence microscopy provides a poweiilapproach, allowing multiple specific molecules in 
a cell to be observed simultaneously. Our microscope system is designed so that the three-dimensional 
images can be recorded efficiently and accurately from the multiply-stained specimens<7>. As illus-
trated in Fig. 2, optical filters for several wavelengths are mounted on a revolving wheel and switch 
fluorescent wavelengths are switched by revolving the filter wheel under the computer control; a 
dychroic mirror is designed to allow 4 kinds of wavelength to be observed simultaneously without 
switching. Operations of optical filter switching, image collection, and focus movement is made under 
the computer control. 
3. Three-Dimensional Image Formation in a Light Microscope 
A microscopic image is not an exact representation of the real object, but instead is distorted by 
optical gblurringh. As light from each of the individual points in the object is three-dimensionally 
spread out in a microscope, a microscope image is formed as a summation of such spread points of Three-Di111e11sio11al Light 1\lficroscope Worksta1i o11for the Analìisof the Cell 479

light. Formation of three-dimensional microscopic images is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3. In a 
mathematical term, the image-forming properties ofa microscope are described by the point-spread 
function (PSF) which decribes how the point light is spread out by the passage through a microscope 
in three dimensions. The intensity distribution of the microscopic image is obtained as the convolution 
of the object intensity distribution with the PSF. 
In an actual microscope, in addition to the theoretically-predicted image distortion, residual 
aberration in the objective lens can cause the additional deviation from the theoretical behavior. 
Especially with a high-numerical apeureobjective lens which is used for high-resolution analysis, 
deviation from the theory is remarkable. For this reason, we first experimentally determine image-
forming properties of the microscope closely in accordance with actual observation conditions. 
Measurement of the PSF is made utilizing very small fluorescent beads (0.1 Êmin diameter) that can 
be regarded as a point light source<8>. The observation conditions are then optimized based upon the 
experimentally-determined PSF, and three-dimensional microscopic images are obtained under the 
optimized conditions. The out-of-focus image contamination is removed by the computational image 
processing using the PSF determined under the same optimized conditions. 
4. Image Processing and Analysis 
A microscopic image contains the out-of-focus image information as described previously, and 
it is necessary to remove the out-of-focus information in order to analyze small subcellular structures 
in high resolution. After three-dimensional images are recorded on a computer, the out-of-focus 
information is removed by the computational image processing to improve the resolution. Several Three-Di111ellsio11al Ligh1 Microscope Works ^¿1io11for1he Amilrsis o/1he Cell 481

microscope system<9><10>. At first the high-resolution three-dimensional analysis was made with the 
chemically-fixed specimens stained with a DNA-specific fluorescent dye. Three-dimensional arE
rangement of the individual chromosomes was determined within a nucleus (Fig. 4). Furthermore 
fluorescent visualization of the chromosomes in live specimens has allowed dynamic behavior of the 
chromosomes to be observed continuously (Fig. 5). 
In high-resolution analysis, specimens are chemically-fixed and three-dimensional images are 
collected at fine focus intervals of0.1-0.25 Êm. In the example shown in Fig. 4, the three-dimensional 
image data were collected at an interval of0.25 Êm and out-of-focus information was removed by the 
iterative deconvolution. 
From the obtained high-resolution image data, a model of the chromosome aÅangement was 
constructed. On the other hand, in case ofliving cell observation, the data collection rate is limited by, 
in many cases, the rate of the structural changes. This compels us to take a limited number of three-
dimensional images (typically 5-10 planes) at relatively low resolution (focus intervals of0.5-1 Êm ). 
Despite of the low resolution, observation of live cells not only eliminates the possibility of artifact 
accompanied with fixation, but also is useful for direct continuous observation of the structural 
changes in individual cases. 
6. Perspectives 
An attempt to visualize three-dimensional cellular structures directly in three dimensions using 
a light microscope is in international trends in the field of cell biology. Importance of such three-
dimensional imaging technologies is becoming gradually perceived in this country as well. The three-
dimensional microscope system described herein is not a goal of our research but instead a starting 
point. We have ahead of us several points to be improved in the technology. The greatest limitation 
in the three-dimensional microscopy at present is that the resolution in a direction of the optical axis 
is remarkably low compared with the one within the focal plane. The substantial solution for this 
problem can be found in a method to reconstruct the three-dimensional images by obtaining multiple 
data setsdomdifferent directions, ideally from directions separated by 90 degrees< 11 >. On the other 
hand, the technological difficulty in making real-time analysis of live cells resides with the fact that 
spatial resolution is liable to be sacrificed because it trades off with the rate of the structural changes. 
At present, the temporal resolution is limited by the CCD read-out rate. To raise the temporal 
resolution without sacrificing the spatial resolution, a higher rate of CCD read-out is required. 
As a long term prospect, it is challenging to make possible the manipulation of the cells by means 
of light. In principle, it should be possible to manipulate cellular events without contact by inducing 
photochemical reactions in a small confined regions within a cell. To restrict the photochemical 
reaction in a small region, it is necessary for excitation to be restricted onto a focal point based on a 
two-photon absorption process<12>. The effects of the excited photo-active substances are analyzed 
with the three-dimensional microscope system in the cells. We believe that our three-dimensional 
microscope system described here has a wide range of applications in imaging and manipulating 
cellular events.
