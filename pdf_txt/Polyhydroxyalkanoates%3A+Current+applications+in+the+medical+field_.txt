Introduction  
 
Conventional plastics are organic polymers of 
high molecular mass. They are usually 
synthetic, however, being lightweight, 
flexible, stable and highly durable, it is used 
in numerous p ackaging applications, 
constructional materials, baby products and 
even in the field of medicine. However, 
plastic is known to cause various health 
problems, also being non -biodegradable, it 
negatively affects the soil, groundwater, water 
table and eventua lly the ecosystem. After 
years of research, PHA was introduced. PHA stands for Polyhydroxyalkanoates. PHA is a 
family of carbon neutral polymers, obtained 
from microorganisms.  PHA was first 
discovered in 1926 by Lemogine in Bacillus 
megaterium , in the form  of poly (3 -
hydroxybutyrate)[PHB] (Chen, 2009) . 
 
PHA are referred to as green plastics, being 
environmental friendly, when compared to the 
conventional plastic under envir onmental 
conditions (in vivo). PHA can be synthesized 
by over 30% of soil inhabiting bacteria. PHA 
has no harmful, acute and chronic health 
effects. PHA is a polymer, consisting of 600 -International Journal of Current Microbiolo gy and Applied Sciences

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are polymers, which are produced by 
microorganis ms in the form of granules under unbalanced growth 
conditions. They are biocompatible, biodegradable and sustainable, which 
makes it suitable for synthesising biomedical apparatus. Devices such as 
sutures, orthopaedic devices, cardiovascular implants, impl ant patches can 
be prepared using different combinations of this polymer. The polymer and 
its composites being biodegradable and sustainable can take over the 
conventional plastics in near future. This article reviews the various aspects 
of polyhydroxyalka noates in the field of biomedicine and concludes PHA 
as the future polymer.  K e y w o r d s

 35000 (R) hydroxy fatty acid monomer units, 
with an alkyl group attache d to it. PHA also 
exist in the form of homopolymer, random 
copolymer and block polymers, depending on 
the bacterial species and growth conditions. 
Out of these monomeric units 150 are 
identified. Monomers are classified as short, 
medium and long chain base d on the number 
of carbon atom present. The short chain 
consists of 5 or less carbon atoms. The 
medium chain consists of 5 -14 carbon atoms 
and the long chain consists of more than 14 
carbon atoms  (Table 1) . PHA can be 
synthesized by either chemical means o r 
biological approaches. Biosynthesis of PHA 
leads to much higher molecular weight 
compared with that achieved with chemical 
methods. Identification of PHA monomers 
have increased tremendously through the 
creation of GMO's to produce PHA with 
specialised f unctional group (from non PHA 
strains).  They are stored as energy storage 
material by various microorganisms. PHA 
promotes long term survival of bacteria under 
nutrient scarce conditions by acting as carbon 
and energy resource. To date more than 90 
genera of both gram positive and gram 
negative bacteria have been identified as PHA 
producers under both aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions. Bacteria stores PHA within 
cytoplasm as granules, size 0.2 - 0.5 micro 
meter.  
 
There are two groups of bacteria: ( ⅰ) Bacteria 
requires limited nutrients (Phosphorous, 
Nitrogen, Oxygen and Magnesium) and do 
not accumulate PHA, during growth phase  
(Table 3) . Example: Pseudomonas oleovorans, 
Pseudomonas putida. (ⅱ) Bacteria that 
accumulate PHA during growth phase and do 
not require any nutrient conditions. Example: 
Escherichia  coli. Increase in carbon/nitrogen 
ratio promotes PHA accumulation while 
reverse of it is responsible for cell growth. 
PHA acts as a potential anti HIV drug, anti 
cancer drug, antibiotics (Chen  and Wu, 2005) . Properties  
 
(A) Biodegradable     
(B) B iocompatible  
(C) Chemically diverse  
(D) Can be manufactured from renewable 
carbon source

(F) No pollution  
(G) Reduce landfill requirement  
(H) Sustainable

(J) Insoluble in water  
(K) Resistant to UV  
(L) Resistant to he at 
(M) Resistant to osmotic shock  
(N) Behave as piezoelectric material  
(O) Soluble in chloroform and other 
chlorinates solvents  
(P) Melting temperature (40 °-180°) 
(Chen, 2009)  (Table 2)  
 
Applications  
 
Cardiovascular: One of the major use of 
PHA's has been in the development of 
cardiovascular    products.  
 
PHA in drug delivery : Aims at increasing 
the availability of drugs as well a s controlled 
release of drugs with respect to time and 
space. Example: PHB and its polymers are 
used for the preparation of microspheres and 
nanoparticles to deliver a range of drug 
PHBV rods and discs are used to deliver 
antibiotics. Polyhydroxyoctanoate were 
evaluated as drug electing stents to reduce the 
possibility of arterial blockage.  
 
PHB - drug conjugates: One problem with 
PHB drug delivery system is the rapid release 
of drugs. Conjugation of drug to PHB 
polymer could increase release time and 
avail ability.

 PHB or PHBV as implant patches: Treat 
defects in the gastrointestinal tract  (local 
resection and closure of defect by suture). 
Implant needs to meet certain criteria:  
 
Should not cause inflammatory response.  
Should be biocompatible.  
Should suppor t wound healing/tissue 
regeneration.  
Patch should disappear after serving their 
purpose  (Biodegradable).  
 
PHBHHX as bone tissue engineering 
materials: PHBHHX has the best 
performance on attachment, proliferation of 
bone marrow cells.  
 
PHA as biodegradable drug carriers: 
Biocompatible PHA with controlled 
degradation rates was described by Martin et 
al., Required criteria:  
 
 Increased porosity.  
 Exposed surface area.  
 Degrade within desirable time frame under 
physiological conditions.  
 
Anti -ageing products : PHA's are 
humectants, meaning they can retain 
moisture, and hydrate the skin by gently 
exfoliating.  
 
Extraction : Polyhydroxy alkanoate are 
accumulated as granules in the cytoplasm of 
bacterial cells. Hence, in order to extract 
PHA, some major requirements a re: 
 
Collection and subculturing of bacterial cells 
on suitable nutrient media  
Microscopic observations  
Nitrogen estimation  
 
The content and composition of PHA and 
there polymers are influenced by the strains of 
microorganisms.  
 Some of the widely used ex traction methods 
are: 
 
Extraction of PHA from bacteria using 
chloroform  
 
Harvest bacterial cells (pellet)  
↓ 
Wash pellet with little volume of chloroform  
↓ 
Add 10 ml chloroform  
↓ 
Heat while shaking at 60 ℃ (pellet disolves)  
↓ 
Cell membrane distrupt and PHA c omes out  
↓ 
Filter  
↓ 
Evaporate by the method of distillation  
↓ 
Add chilled methanol  → PHA film obtained  
 
(Valid for both gram positive and gram 
negative bacteria with 95% extraction 
capacity of total PHA)  
 
Extraction of PHA in its natural state  
 
A less dras tic method of extraction leaves the 
PHA in a form similar to that found in 
bacterial cells. In such a method, bacterial 
cells are treated with detergents. Detergents 
degrade the cells thereby releasing PHA and 
denaturing most other cell components.  
 
The pr ocess of purification is completed by a 
brief treatment with bleach (oxidizing agent), 
capable of breaking chemical bonds in the 
polyester,  lowering its molecular weight.  
 
(C) D igestion method:  This method involves 
the digestion of the cellular materials 
surrounding the PHA granules. Chemical 
methods may be chemical digestion method 
or enzymatic digestion method.  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2020) 9(6): 3367 -3379

 Wound dressing  
 
Wound dressing is a technique that  may or 
may not be surgical. This technique involves 
providing the wound with aseptic or sterilized 
environment in order to prevent undue 
contamination of the wound. This technique is 
basically employed in areas where healing of 
the wound by itself is diffi cult and painful. In 
some cases, wound dressing is employed to 
apply medication to the wounded area.  
 
Types of dressings   
 
Dressings may be of the following types:   
 
● Sutures  
● Staples  
● Transparent adhesives  
● Clips  
 
Suture : is a largest group of medical  
apparatus used in wound healing, commonly 
known as stitches. They may be natural or 
synthetic. Sutures are used mainly to treat 
vascular wounds and tissue wounds. Their 
main purpose is wound closure, it involves a 
needle attached with a thread, however th e 
size, shape and materials have been 
drastically evolved with new developments 
over the years. The sutures are secured with a 
surgical knot at the end of the wound.  
 
Characteristics : 
 
Biologically inert  
 Antimicrobial properties  
● ease in handling (Pliable)  
● have high tensile strength  
● non allergic to host  
● non carcinogenic  
● should be absorbed after serving its 
function  
● must be able to dissolve in body fluids 
(absorbable sutures)  
 History : suturing as a technique is not new,  
this procedure is now known for ages. 
Physicians have been using suture for 
thousands of years now. However, with the 
advancement in the medical and surgical 
fields, the material used for this procedure has 
drastically evolved since time immemorial. 
Ancie nt records show the use of hair, linen, 
grass, pig bristles, cotton, silk and animal gut 
to close wounds, but today we rarely see such 
suture.  
 
Classification : sutures are classified into two 
categories:  
 
1. On the basis of origin  
2. On the basis of abso rbability  
1. On the basis of origin: sutures are further 
classified as natural and synthetic . 
 
● Natural suture : are obtained directly from 
the nature. For example : hair, grass, cotton, 
pig bristles and dried animal gut (cats).  
● Synthetic suture : are thos e that are 
artificially synthesised by humans, to serve 
the purpose of wound dressing. For example : 
silk, nylon, polyester, stainless steel.  
 
2. On the basis of absorbability : sutures are 
further classified as absorbable and non -
absorbable.  
 
● Absorbable s uture : are those, that have the 
tendency to dissolve themselves in the body 
fluids, after serving its purpose. The duration 
in which the suture dissolves itself may vary 
from 10 days to 8 weeks, depending upon the 
severity of wound.  
 
For example: catgut su ture, Poly -glycolic acid 
suture, collagen, poly -lactic acid suture etc.  
 
● Non- absorbable suture : are those,  that lack 
the tendency to dissolve themselves in body 
fluids and thus have to be removed after 
wound closure.  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2020) 9(6): 3367 -3379  
 
3374  
 For example : nylon, polyester, stainless steel, 
polypropylene etc. (Pillai  and Sharma, 2010) . 
 
Selection of suture material : Selection of 
suture material is a complicated process. 
Today we have a large variety of suture 
mastering a few properties over the others. No 
one suture is ideal for all ty pes of surgeries. 
The tensile strength, its absorption rate, its 
flexibility and the ease to knot are some of the 
important considering factors for a surgeon. If 
suture are not selected judiciously, it may 
increase the complications of a surgery and 
also m ay delay the healing process.  
 
Polyhydroxyalkanoates in suture : For a 
material to be used as suture, it must not only 
be biocompatible but also biodegradable. 
PHA's are polyester, produced by 
microorganisms. The most common PHA 
used in suture production is  PHB poly(3 -
hydroxybutyrate) and its related copolymer 
PHBV poly(3HB -co-3HV).  
 
Both these polymers are biocompatible i.e. 
are non -toxic to the host and does not produce 
host immune reactions such as inflammation, 
necrosis, tumor formation when incorporate d 
in the host body.  
 
Both PHB and PHBV are slow biodegrading 
polymers and undergo anaerobic 
biodegradation in the form of sediments, 
whereas PGA (Poly -glycolic acid) which is 
still in use as suture is a bulk degrading 
polymer. PGA being a bulk degrading 
polymer, has the tendency to accumulate in 
various parts of the body, since bulk 
degradation is difficult to remove from the 
host system. This accumulation of PGA 
polymer is toxic to the surrounding tissue in 
the long run. But the slow degrading PHB and 
PHBV  does not get accumulated in the 
surrounding tissues and is removed from the 
host system after completing its function.  
 PHB has a high tensile strength of 40MPa, 
which makes it suitable for suture preparation 
as it exhibits the strength necessary for tiss ue 
joining, thereby healing the wound.  
 
Presence of foreign materials in wound is  
known to enhance the infection in wounds. 
PHB and PHBV do not show any reaction 
with the foreign material, hence prevent the 
spread of infection. Another approach to 
avoid wo und infection is the production of 
antimicrobial suture. This can be done by 
incorporating silver metal on the surface of 
PHB or PHBV suture.  
 
Thus, PHB and PHBV have several 
advantages over the most commercially 
available sutures.  However, the 
commerciali zation of PHA as suture is curbed 
by the high cost of its production. (Dennis et 
al., 2016)  
 
Drug delivery systems : are artificially 
engineered medical apparatus used for 
targeted delivery or control release of the 
drug. The purpose of the drug delivery system 
is to control the rate at which drug is released 
and the site where it is released. Drug delivery 
systems are of various types, they may be in 
the form of tablets, nanoparticles, implant 
patches. Here we are going to focus majorly 
on the implant patches.  
 
Implant patches : An implant is a device used 
to deliv er drug at a particular site of action or 
can be used to replace a defect in a biological 
structure or support a damaged biological 
structure.   
 
For example: Contraceptive patch : it is a 
transdermal patch, safe and reliable. When 
placed on the skin of bell y, upper arm, butt or 
lower back, it releases a hormone that 
prevents pregnancy.  
 
 Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2020) 9(6): 3367 -3379  
 
3375  
 Implant patches not only have their 
applications in contraception but also in 
cosmetics, sensory and neurological disorder, 
cardiovascular mis -function, orthopaedics.  
 
Prope rties  
 
● Biocompatible  
● Biodegradable  
● Non allergic to host  
● Non reactive in host system  
● Non carcinogenic  
● Anti microbial  
 
Types:  three major types of implant patches 
are commercially used:  
ⅰ. Stainless steel  
ⅱ. Cobalt - chromium alloy  
ⅲ. Titanium based allo y 
 
Challenges /Complications  
  
ⅰ. Stainless steel patches are prone to 
corrosion, when subjected in the host body. 
As a result may cause foreign body response, 
pain, rejection, inflammation  (Table 4) . 
 
ⅱ. Cobalt -chromium alloy implants : some 
patients are al lergic to metal implants. 
Introduction of this type of an alloy in such 
patients can cause an aggressive form of skin 
cancer in the host, which is now known as the 
Marjolin's ulcer. Major symptom includes  
errythema, rash, eczema, swelling and pain.  
 
ⅲ. Titanium based implant : are generally used 
in orthopaedic devices and oral implants. The 
accumulation of titanium ions or particulate 
titanium in the nearby tissues can induce 
allergic type 1 to 4 reactions.  
 
PHA as implants   
 
PHB based implant patches for 
gastrointestinal tract on rat model, it was 
observed that neither an inflammatory response nor fibrosis was observed with the 
introduction of this polymer into the host, 
unlike that observed with the commercially 
available metal implants.  
 
Similarly, PHBV b ased implant patches for 
wound healing in dogs, aged 12 weeks. the 
dogs were studied until the age of 25 weeks. 
It was found that it took approximately 7 
weeks for complete wound closure and with 
no observations of foreign body immune 
response, inflammatio n or tissue fibrosis. 
(Chen  and Wu, 2005)  
 
PHB c an be used as transdermal patches as it 
is relatively resistant to hydrolytic 
degradation and it posses water insolubility, 
shows great resistance to ultra violet 
radiations, has high melting point of 175 ℃, is 
non toxic to both human and animal host.  
 
Orthopaedic devices:  is a medical device, 
used to correct or treat skeletal deformities in 
humans and animals.  
 
Fracture fixation:  is a term used to refer the 
stabilization of a broken bone or in simple 
words when a bone breaks, its pieces get 
aligned in an unstable manner, which needs to 
be fixed back to its original location in order 
to ensure mobility.  
 
There are various devices, commonly referred 
to as fracture fixation devices which are 
commercially available and are used to 
stabilize a broken bone. Thes e devices are of 
various shapes and sizes and are used 
accordingly. These include pins, rods, screws, 
nails, bone plates and many others.  
 
Properties  
 
● Biocompatible  
● High modulus of elasticity  
● Non corrosive  
● Non allergic  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2020) 9(6): 3367 -3379  
 
3376  
 ● Ductile  
● Malleable  
● Stiff  
 
History:  Internal fixation of fractures is not a 
new technique, it has been practiced for more 
than 100 years now. However, the material 
used for these devices has changed overtime, 
due to some major complications.  
 
By the mid 20th century, titanium and  
stainless steel were used to prepare such 
devices. However these materials still have 
disadvantages.  
 
Metals have been used in fracture fixation 
since time immemorial, owing to its high 
stiffness, strength and low cost, despite the 
biological responses th ey produce when 
introduced into the host system.  
 
Many of the components of stainless steel 
devices such as chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), 
iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) are known to cause 
toxicity and effect variety of systems of the 
host, such as the vascular, i mmune, excretory, 
reproductive and nervous system. Also Ni 
ions are known to cause aggressive skin 
allergies. Moreover, Ni, Cr and Co are known 
to interfere the DNA repair mechanism, as a 
result responsible for altered gene expression. 
High levels of Cr io ns are  known to cause 
hepatocellular necrosis. Ni ions have  been 
shown to increase the mortality due to 
cardiovascular diseases.  
 
Also Cr ions exposure to mice has shown a 
decrease sperm count and induced sperm 
abnormalities, as well as reducing the number  
of ovarian follicles and ova in mice.  
 
Titanium and titanium based alloys gets 
degraded into titanium ions or particulate 
titanium when subjected to friction. The 
accumulation of these titanium ions is toxic 
for the surrounding tissues and might cause toxicity and induce foreign body response, 
inflammation, tissue necrosis and unwanted 
pain at the site  (Hayes  and Richards, 2010) . 
 
Complications:  Introduction of metals as 
fixation device into the host may lead to a 
number of complications such as necrosis, 
pain, inflammation and may induce a ho st 
immune response. Nevertheless, metals are 
strong and cost effective but are toxic to the 
host, which may lead to the surgical removal 
of the entire organ if its toxicity spreads to the 
neighbouring tissues.  
 
Alternative: PHA as fracture fixation 
device  
 
PHB poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) and its 
copolymer PHBV poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate -
co-3-hydroxyvalerate) can replace the metals 
in fracture fixation. These are natural 
polymers, synthesised by various different 
types of bacteria.  
 
PHB and PHBV are an interesting b iopolymer 
having mechanical strength in compression of 
62MPa, which is about the same order of 
magnitude of several bones in human body 
and thus can be used in the fracture fixation. 
Other remarkable properties of this 
biopolymer is its biocompatibilty, sh ows no 
host immune response being non -toxic to the 
host, being water insoluble it can be 
introduced into the host system without a 
second thought. Has high modulus of 
elasticity which makes it strong and 
replaceable to the metal fixation devices.  
 
Plastics  in healthcare industry : Plastic is a 
dynamic material, development of which has 
revolutionized almost all the industries. But 
when we precisely look at the healthcare 
industry, plastic is almost everywhere; from a 
small syringe to meter long catheters and  
large medical packaging. This diversity is 
observed because of its tendency to be Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2020) 9(6): 3367 -3379

 moulded in any shape and any size. Its light 
weight, durability, low cost and transparency 
makes it ideal for the healthcare industry. 
Some of the most widely used plastics in 
healthcare are PVC (Poly -vinyl chloride), PE 
(Polyethylene), PP (Polypropylene), PS 
(Polystyrene) and PET (Polyethylene 
terephthalate).  
 
Some plastic material in healthcare 
industry : 
 
● Syringes  
● Gloves  
● Coats  
● Mask  
● Hair and shoe caps  
● Disposal ba gs 
● Catheter  
● Cannula  
● Dropper  
 
Plastics have made the healthcare industry 
smooth  
 
Advantages  
 
ⅰ. Cost effective : plastic production is cost 
effective. Since the healthcare industry 
demands large number of plastic based 
equipments, it becomes difficult to used 
ceramic, glass or metal equipments because of 
its high cost and maintenance.  
 
Because of its cost effective nature, single use 
syringes, gloves and various other equipments 
are available commercially nowadays, this in 
turn prevents the spread of va rious infectious 
diseases.  
 
ⅱ. Low weight : The low weight of plastic 
equipment  ensures  its easy handling.  
 
ⅲ. Can be moulded into any shape : and thus 
has various applications.  
 Disadvantages  
 
● Plastic disposal is still a problem. Its non 
biodegradable nature does not allow its 
degradation instead results in the release of 
toxic fumes harmful for both humans and 
animals.  
● Its accumulation in the soil results in release 
of some toxic substances, thereby polluting 
the soil as well as the water table.  
● Can be carcinogenic
