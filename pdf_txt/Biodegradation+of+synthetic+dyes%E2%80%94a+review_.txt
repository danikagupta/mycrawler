This in turn would increase wastewater generation from 23 dye industrial activities. Various dyes and its structural compounds present in dye industrial 24 wastewater have harmful effects on plants, animals and humans. Synthetic dyes are more 25 resistant than natural dyes to physical and chemical methods for remediation which makes 26 them more difficult to get decolorize. Microbial degradation has been researched and 27 reviewed largely for quicker dye degradation. Genetically engineered microorganisms 28 (GEMs) play important role in achieving complete dye degradation. This paper provides 29 scientific and technical information about dyes & dye intermediates and biodegradation of 30 azo dye. It also compiles information about factors affecting dye(s) biodegradation, role of 31 genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in process of dye(s) degradation and perspectives 32 in this field of research.  33 Keywords: Biodegradation; Decolorization; Genetically modified organism; Dye 34 intermediates 35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  3 1. Introduction 44 Dyes are an important source in various industries such as textile, leather, paint, 45 food, cosmetic and paper industries. There are approximately twenty-five types of dye 46 groups available based on their chemical structure of chromophore (Sudha et al., 2014; 47 Benkhaya et al., 2020). More than thousand dyes have been classified as textile dyes which 48 are used to color variety of fabrics (Sponza, 2006; Abe et al., 2019). Dye intermediates are 49 precursors of dyes. They can be obtained from raw constituents, such as naphthalene and 50 benzene, with an aid of various chemical reactions (Gregory, 2009; Guo et al., 2018). 51  52 Disposal of municipal- and other industrial- effluents into water bodies cause water 53 pollution (Kunz et al., 2002; Varjani and Upasani, 2017b). Environment is adversely 54 affected by pollution which may cause indirect or direct health risks to all life forms on the 55 earth (Varjani, 2017; Bencheqroun et al., 2019). Dyes can be classified on the base of their 56 structure and application. Dyes have a great solubilizing capability in water, which makes it 57 difficult to be removed by traditional methods (Dong et al., 2019; Lellis et al., 2019). 58 Textile dye contains colors, which causes artistic damage as well as stops diffusion of light 59 in the water which leads to decrease in dissolved oxygen level and affects photosynthesis 60 rate of aquatic life (Ajaz et al., 2020). 61  62 Various methods can be used to remove dyes and other pollutants from industrial 63 effluent such as physico-chemical, biological, chemical and physical (Xu et al., 2007; Cao 64 et al., 2019; Varjani and Upasani, 2019b). Biological treatment has various advantages such 65 as, it is a simple, cheap, environmental friendly process. Also large number of 66  4 microorganisms are available which are easy to maintain and also require low preparation 67 (Crini et al., 2019). Apart from these dye degradation techniques periphyton biofilm or 68 periphytic biofilm system can be also used for degradation of dyes (Li and Bishop 2004; 69 Shabbir et al., 2017a; Shabbir et al., 2017b; Pandey and Bergey, 2018; Dias et al., 2019; 70 Shabbir et al., 2020). Among various activities of dye industries, dye manufacturing is the 71 main source of environmental pollution due to release of hazardous dye in water bodies. 72 Numerous microorganisms such as algae, yeast, bacteria, and fungi possess ability to 73 mineralize and/or decolorize various dyes (Roy et al., 2018; Tochhawng et al., 2019). 74 Treatment of dye wastewater can be performed using pure culture or mixed microbial 75 culture. Majorly mixed microbial culture has been reported to achieve efficient dye 76 degradation due to synergistic metabolic actions (Kalyani et al., 2009; Mandal et al., 2010).  77  78 Genetic engineering has made a significant revolution in the field of bioremediation 79 (Varjani et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2020). Removal of acid red has been reported through 80 the successful manipulation of microorganism using genetically engineering in treatment 81 system (Jin et al., 2008). Factors like pH, temperature, structure of dye, soluble salts, heavy 82 metals, nutrients, etc., affect the degradation of dye (Al-Amrani et al., 2014). There are 83 various reports available which shows degradation of different dyes using microorganisms 84 (Mane et al., 2008; Varjani and Upasani, 2016; Kiayi et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Pratiwi et 85 al., 2019).  86  87 Present review intends to expand biodegradation scope of dyes. It includes types of 88 dyes, dye intermediates and impact of dyes. It also narrates types of dye degradation 89  5 techniques and through light on factors affecting biodegradation of dyes. Direct Black 38 is 90 majorly used azo dye, hence microbial degradation pathway for Direct Black 38 has been 91 discussed. It also provides an overview about role of genetically modified organisms 92 (GMOs) in dye(s) biodegradation. 93  94 2. Types of dyes 95  96 There are more than three thousand azo dyes among which Sandolan Yellow, 97 Maxilon Blue GRL and Astrazon Red GTLN are broadly applied in leather, textile, paper, 98 food coloring and cosmetic manufacture industries (Sudha et al., 2014). From centuries 99 fabric dyes have been used to color fabrics. More than thousand dyes are classified as 100 textile dyes which are used to color variety of different fabrics. Nowadays most of clothes 101 are colored with manmade or synthetic dyes. Dyes contains at least one chromophore and 102 can absorb light in visible spectrum (400-700 nm).  103  104 Classification of dyes are carried out on the basis of their structure and application. 105 Azo dye, nitro dye, phthalein dye, Triphenyl methane dye, indigoid dye and anthraquinone 106 dye are classified on the basis of their structure. Whereas, acid dye, basic dye, direct dye, 107 ingrain dye, disperse dye, moderate dye, vat dye and reactive dyes are classified on the base 108 of their application. In this paper azo- and anthraquinone- dyes have been explained in 109 detail. 110  111  6 2.1. Azo dyes – Azo dyes contain azo bond (-N=N-) and belong to class of heterocyclic 112 and aromatic compounds they also contain carcinogenic properties (Sen et al., 2016; 113 Yamjala et al., 2016). Maximum azo dyes are synthesized by diazotization of an aromatic 114 primary amine and followed by coupling with one or more electron rich nucleophiles 115 (hydroxy and amino). Several other methods are also available for synthesis of azo dyes 116 such as oxidation of primary amines by lead tetra-acetate or permanganate potassium, 117 reduction of nitroso compounds by AlLiH4, condonation of quinone and hydrazine, etc. 118 (Benkhaya et al., 2020). These dyes are recorded for industrial applications and only azo 119 dye contains 60% ratio as compared to all other types of dyes (Shah, 2014; Iark et al., 120 2019). Azo dyes make up group of food and drug administration (FDA) certified colorants 121 which make them safe for use in foods, cosmetics and drugs (Chung, 2016). Examples of 122 azo dyes are Acid orange 5, Acid red 88, Methyl orange, Congo red and Direct Black 38.  123  124 2.2. Anthraquinone dyes – Second most widely used dyes after azo dyes are 125 anthraquinone dyes due to their good dyeing performance, easy accessibility and low price 126 but it is highly toxic to humans and microorganisms than azo dyes. Anthraquinone dyes 127 contain anthraquinone chromophore groups which includes benzene ring with two carbonyl 128 group on both sides. They contain both stable as well as complex structure. Color of the dye 129 may be influenced by different effects of substituents such as electron accepting and 130 electron donating substituents. Common natural red colorants comprise presence of 131 anthraquinones which are highly used in textile industries (Shahid et al., 2019). 132 Anthraquinone dye has been reported as the oldest dyes because they have been found 133 thousands years back and were used in wrapping mummies (Gurses et al., 2016). Naturally 134  7 occurring anthraquinone establish the major group of natural quinoids. Several scale insects 135 and plant roots are responsible for production of natural anthraquinones. Plants such as chai 136 root, madder and Indian mulberry (from Rubiaceae family) and scale insects like lac, 137 kermes and cochineal produce beautiful color palettes of red hues on different types of 138 fibre. Color of palette is dependent on the metallic salt used for the mordant with limited 139 color range of purple, brown and orange. Anthraquenone dyes have been divided into four 140 categories: i) Heterocyclic Anthraquinone dyes, ii) Heterocyclic anthrone dyes, iii) 141 Anthraquinone derivations, vi) Fused ring anthrone dyes (Li et al., 2019). Examples of 142 Anthraquinone dyes are C.I. Reactive Blue 19, Alizarin and C.I. Acid Blue 45.  143  144 3. Intermediates of dyes 145  146 Conversion of commercial dyes with simple transformation from compounds 147 prepared from the coal tar elements with the use of different chemical reactions are known 148 as intermediates. Sabnis (2017), have reported dye intermediates as the raw materials used 149 in the synthesis of organic dyes/manufacturing dye stuff. They are nearly colorless and vary 150 in the complexity. Three types of reactions used for the production of intermediates of 151 dyes: a) Electrophilic substitution, b) Nucleophilic substitution and c) Unit processes 152 (Sabnis, 2017; Yu et al., 2019) 153  154 3.1.  Electrophilic substitution  155  156  8 This reaction is used to give tetrahedral carbon atom as an intermediate, in this the 157 initial attack of an electrophile E+ is involved by aromatic system. However, for final 158 product, loss of Y+ (usually proton) from intermediate is necessary. Mono-substitution 159 products can be achieved by attack at an unsubstituted benzene ring. In this reaction three 160 possible sites are available for attack (Ortho, Para and Meta position), when benzene ring 161 contained a group during electrophilic attack (Gregory, 2009). 162  163 3.2.  Nucleophilic substitution 164  165   Nucleophilic reagent has an individual electron pair. They are either a neutral 166 particle or a charged particle e.g. ammonia. This reaction includes group replacement 167 which is activated by other substitutions within aromatic nucleus (Sabnis, 2017). 168  169 3.3 Unit processes 170  171 Unit process can be defined as production stage which requires chemical reactions. 172 Dyes and dye intermediates are produced using a reactor followed by filtration. Then they 173 are dried and mixed with other additives for final product manufacturing. The synthesis 174 involves many unit processes like reduction, oxidation, nitration, sulfonation, 175 hydroxylation, amination, alkylation, halogenation, hydrolysis, condensation, alkoxylation, 176 esteriﬁcation, carboxylation, acylation, phosgenation, diazotization and coupling. In this 177 section we have discussed few unit processes (Gregory, 2009; Freeman et al., 2007; Sabnis, 178 2016).  179  9  180 3.3.1 Oxidation - Oxidation is the process which involves introduction of oxygen or 181 removal of hydrogen from a molecule, mostly arises at an early stage of synthesis. Highly 182 substituted particles are less responsive to oxidation (Gregory, 2009; Huang et al., 2019). 183 Conversion of phthalic anhydride from naphthalene can be done by oxidation reaction with 184 the use of hot V2O5 or KMnO4. e.g. Hypochlorite oxidation is the production of anthranilic 185 acid by Hofmann process (Gregory, 2009; Freeman et al., 2007). 186  187 3.3.2 Reduction - In reduction process conversion of compounds into an arylene diamine or 188 arylamine from an aromatic dinitro or nitro takes place. Reduction processes such as 189 sulphide reduction, catalytic hydrogenation and iron reduction are widely used in industrial 190 production of dyes. eg. In preparation of indoles and pyrazolones, arylhydrazines have been 191 used as intermediates (Gregory, 2009). 192  193 3.3.3 Nitration - Nitration is the process which introduce one or more nitro groups (serve as 194 chromophores) into aromatic ring system and they are meta-directing groups. Nitration 195 reaction involves chemical agents sus as Nitric acid (HNO3). Nitration is frequently 196 directed by using mixed acid or nitrating mixture which is a combination of sulphuric acid 197 (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3) (Freeman et al., 2007). 198  199 4. Impact of dyes and dye intermediates 200  201  10 Approximately from all color additives 50% azo dyes are extensively used as 202 coloring substances in cosmetic, drug and food industries. This increases concern related to 203 health and safety. Global usage of azo dye as food additive is being regulated (Jiang et al., 204 2020). Azo dye toxicity is based on benzidine and its counterpart like dimethoxy- and 205 dimethyl- benzidine. It may show mutagenic effect on monkeys, humans, dogs, and rodents 206 which lead to disease like cancer (Suryavathi et al., 2005; Bencheqroun et al., 2019). 207 Several dyes are reported to have adverse effect on ecosystem as described in table 1. Dye 208 industrial activity negatively affects human health and environmental condition through 209 large amount of waste discharged into open water sources (Chung, 2016; Bencheqroun et 210 al., 2019). Use of azo dye shows undesirable effect in soil microbial populations and affects 211 plant growth and germination (Lellis et al., 2019). De Jong et al. (2016), have used Hydra 212 attenuata as a model to study ecotoxicological impact of mix pollutants in marine 213 environment. They have reported that presence of Disperse Red 1 into fresh water affects 214 biological functions, morphology, neurotransmitter distribution and feeding behavior of 215 Hydra attenuata. Hydra attenuata contain antioxidant defense mechanism but at high 216 concentration of dye morphological healthy appearance of this organism was affected, as 217 result asexual reproduction was reduced and feeding behavior was also inhibited (De Jong 218 et al., 2016). 219  220 5. Degradation of dyes 221  222 Complexity of dye structure (crystal ponceau 6R (502.4 g/mol molecular weight), 223 reactive green 19 (1418.94 g/mol molecular weight), remazol red (560.5 g/mol molecular 224  11 weight), Direct Blue 71 (1029.87 g/mol molecular weight)) make its degradation difficult 225 (Ajaz et al., 2020). Removal of dye industry effluent without proper treatment is harmful 226 for environment and human health (Oon et al., 2020). Several methods are available to treat 227 dye effluent(s). Physical, chemical and biological treatment ((either individually or in 228 combination) have been reported to be widely used for degradation of dyes (Lua et al., 229 2019; Lan et al., 2019). 230  231 5.1.  Physico-chemical degradation: 232  233 Physico-Chemical degradation is a combination of chemical and physical 234 techniques (Kumar et al., 2020). Physico-chemical treatment is the process in which 235 physical changes are constantly present, while chemical changes in the process at different 236 phases may or may not take place (Karimifard and Alavi Moghaddam, 2018). In this 237 process chemicals such as Lime, Ferric chloride (FeCl3), Ferrous sulphate (FeSO4.7H2O) 238 and Alum ((Al2SO4)3.18H2O) are widely used to alter physical state of dye molecules 239 (Ayed et al., 2020). Treatments such as flocculation, wet oxidation, membrane separations, 240 adsorption and precipitation are examples of physico-chemical treatment (Wang et al., 241 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). The disadvantages of this methods are high chemical 242 requirement, high maintenance, costly and large amount of sludge is generated which 243 requires safe dumping (Ajaz et al., 2020). 244  245 5.2. Biological degradation 246  247  12 Biological degradation of pollutants is eco-friendly, shows complete mineralization 248 of organic compounds with low sludge generation. This method has been reported as most 249 effective method (Varjani et al., 2015; Bhatia et al., 2017; Varjani et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 250 2020). Biological degradation can be conducted under aerobic or anaerobic conditions 251 (Khan et al., 2012; Bhatia et al., 2017). Various microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, 252 yeast and algae were used for dye degradation and decolorization (Ali, 2010; Ajaz et al., 253 2020). Difference in growth conditions and different metabolic mechanism of 254 microorganisms affects degradation of dyes (Gao et al., 2018). Shabbir et al., (2017a) and 255 Shabbir et al., (2017b), reported degradation of dyes with use of locally available 256 biomaterial (periphyton). Reports have demonstrated importance of enzyme in degradation 257 of dyes such as, azoreductase, laccase, peroxidase and exo-enzymes. E. gallinarum and 258 Streptomyces S27 has been reported for degradation of azo dyes with use of azoreductase 259 enzyme (Bafana et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2019). Laccase have great degradation potential 260 for many aromatic compounds (Bhatia et al., 2017). Shanmugam et al. (2017), have 261 reported maximum biodegradation of Malachite Green by Trichoderma asperellum laccase 262 activity which converted benzaldehyde from Malachite Green via the Michler's ketone 263 pathway. Immobilization of laccase on Glutaraldehyde-crosslinked Chitosan Beads (GA-264 CBs) has been reported by Nguyen et al. (2016), provided reusability and high catalytic 265 ability which helped in degradation of sulfur dyes when concentration of laccase was low. 266 Enzymatic degradation of crystal ponceau 6R (CP6R) with the help of Brassica rapa 267 peroxidase has been studied which shows catalytic activity of peroxidase during dye 268 degradation (Almaguer et al., 2018).  269  270  13 5.2.1. Microbial degradation - For degradation of various dyes different microbes can be 271 used, they have different mechanisms and pathways for degradation of dyes (Cao et al., 272 2019; Ebrahimi et al., 2019).  273 Azo dyes are useful class of dyes with highest diversity of colors. Under anaerobic 274 condition and with help of azoreductase, microorganisms degrade azo dyes and as end 275 product they form colorless aromatic amines (Ali, 2010; Ajaz et al., 2020; Dong et al., 276 2019). Benzidine is generally used in construction of direct azo dyes and has been reported 277 as potential carcinogen (Dewan et al., 1988; Ali, 2010; Sen et al., 2016). Direct dyes are 278 inexpensive and used to dye fibers, leathers or papers without any pre-treatment. Among 279 benzidine based azo dyes most generally used dye is Direct Black 38. Degradation of 280 Direct Black 38 dye can be achieved using Enterococcus gallinarum (Bafana et al., 2008; 281 Bafana et al., 2009). Direct Black 38 has three azo bonds in its structure which are the 282 active sites for azoreductase. Direct Black 38 through metabolic reactions is converted to 283 benzidine which upon deamination results in 4-amion phenyl. It has been reported that dyes 284 which have benzidine as a base is highly carcinogenic as compared to the dyes without 285 Benzidine (Yamjala et al., 2016). This is due to existence of pollutant(s) like 4-amino 286 biphenyl and 2-4, diaminoazo-benzene, which have been reported as carcinogens (Dewan 287 et al., 1988; Ali, 2010; Bencheqroun et al., 2019).   288  289 6. Factor affecting biodegradation of dyes 290  291 Microbe based treatments for degradation of toxic environmental pollutants are 292 economically viable, cost effective and also helps to manage environmental contaminants 293  14 (Varjani and Upasani, 2017a: Rodrigues de Almeida et al., 2019; Do et al., 2020; Mishra et 294 al., 2020). Dye industrial wastewater holds variability of azo dyes along with other dye 295 stuff which are structurally different. It has been reported that metals, salts and other 296 compounds make degradation of dyes more difficult and it is toxic for bacterial growth too 297 (Ghosh et al., 2020). Factors like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, dissolved 298 organic matter, metals and organic pollutants influence water quality (Al-Amrani et al., 299 2014). Organic contaminants such as 2-napthole, Chloroaniline, Benzene, P-300 aminobenzoicacid, Ethylenedibromide, Pyrene, P-nitrophenol, etc. are commonly used in 301 dye manufacturing and highly present in dye industry wastewater and affects growth of 302 bacteria during wastewater treatment (Awad et al., 2019). The factors affecting dye 303 degradation are mainly divided into two categories. i) Environmental factors, ii) Nutritional 304 factors. 305  306 6.1.  Environmental factors 307  308 6.1.1.  pH - pH is important factor for growth of bacteria and also an essential 309 characteristic for effluent treatment (Varjani and Upasani, 2017b). pH can be acidic, 310 alkaline or neutral based on type of dyes and salts used. Rate of dye degradation in dye 311 containing effluent may change through its pH. The problem can be solved by (a) adjusting 312 pH of effluent to support the growth of dye degrading bacteria or (b) selecting the microbial 313 sp. which can grow at effluent pH (Al-Amrani et al., 2014). Basutkar and Shivannavar 314 (2019), reported maximum dye degradation at pH range of 8-10 by using Lysinibacillus 315  15 boronitolerans CMGS-2. 98% degradation of malachite green was achieved RuO2–TiO2 316 and Pt coated Ti mesh electrodes at pH 4.5 (Singh et al., 2016). 317  318 6.1.2. Temperature - Water temperature affects activities prevailing in water such as 319 mineralization, diffusion, chemical process which increases pH of water (Delpla et al., 320 2009; Varjani and Upasani, 2019b). Extreme temperatures can kill bacteria/affect the 321 growth, if bacteria present in wastewater (Al-Amrani et al., 2014; Varjani and Upasani, 322 2017b). Faster rate in degradation of dye can be achieved by giving bacterial culture an 323 optimum temperature which is generally reported as 30-40oC for most bacteria. Das and 324 Mishra (2017), have used bacterial consortium of Bacillus pumilus HKG212 and Zobellella 325 taiwanensis AT 1-3 for degradation of reactive green 19 and reported highest degradation 326 at 32.04oC. However, few thermophilic bacteria are reported for degradation of azo dye at 327 high temperature. Gursahani and Gupta (2011), reported 75% degradation of effluent at 328 60oC by using Anoxybacillus rupiensis. It has been reported that decolorization rate 329 decreases as temperature increases (Imran et al., 2015).  330  331 6.1.3. Oxygen and agitation - Environmental conditions directly affect 332 degradation/decolorization of dye. Literature is available stating that microbial metabolism 333 is influenced by oxygen and agitation (Varjani and Upasani, 2017a). Different 334 microorganisms require different conditions such as aerobic condition, anaerobic and semi 335 anaerobic. Shaking play role in aeration/oxygen supply. Oxygenation can be improved by 336 shaking. It is supposed that reductive enzyme activities can be increased under anaerobic 337 condition. However, for aerobic dye degradation oxidative enzymes play important role 338  16 which require presence of oxygen (Khan et al., 2012). Gonzalez-Gutierrez-de-Lara and 339 Gonzalez-Martinez (2017), studied Direct Blue 2 dye degradation under different oxygen 340 concentration. 341  342 6.2. Nutritional factors 343  344 6.2.1. Soluble salts - Wastewater from dye industry contains high electric conductivity due 345 to use of high salt concentration in dying process which can be detected using conductivity 346 meter. To increase ionic strength and development of dye fixation on fabrics salts like 347 Na2SO4, NaCl and NaNO3 are usually added in the dye bath. Hence, with release of dye 348 pollutants, salts are also released in industrial wastewater. Dyes containing high salt 349 concentration may decrease biodegradation rate by reducing biological movement 350 (Basutkar and Shivannavar, 2019).   351  352 6.2.2. Carbon and nitrogen supplements - Microorganisms require nutrient supplements 353 for quick degradation of pollutants (Varjani and Upasani, 2019a). Organic sources like 354 peptone, yeast extract or combination of carbohydrates and complex organic sources have 355 been reported to obtain high and quick dye degradation rate by both pure cultures and 356 mixed cultures. Dye degradation efficiency can be increased by addition of glucose. 357 Glucose has been reported as most effective and easily available carbon source for 358 microbial metabolism of dyes or dye intermediates (Khan et al., 2012). Phosphorus has 359 been reported as very important factor for growth of microorganism (Kisand et al., 2001; 360 Varjani, and Upasani, 2019a).  361  17 6.2.3. Dye concentration and dye structure - Dye concentration and dye structure 362 influence degradation/decolorization of dye. Low dye concentration may not have 363 identified by enzymes which are secreted from dye degrading bacteria. On the other hand, 364 high dye concentration is toxic to bacteria and also effect degradation of dye by blocking 365 enzyme active sites. Likewise, low molecular weight and simple structure containing dyes 366 are easy to decolorize. Whereas, high molecular weight and complex structure containing 367 dyes have low decolorization rate (Li et al., 2019). Increased dye concentration decreases 368 dye decolorization and/or degradation (Liu et al., 2017). 369  370 7. Role of genetically modified organisms 371  372 Addition of desired gene into the organism for any particular purpose (i.e. foreign 373 gene), which is not generally part of the host system, produces genetically modified 374 organism (GMO). Nature has self-cleaning process under environmental condition, but 375 literature is available stating that it is insufficient and slow to remove pollutants (Peter et 376 al., 2011; Mishra et al., 2019). Several physical, chemical and biological treatments have 377 been reported for the degradation of hazardous pollutants such as dyes which can be used 378 as individually or in combination (Li et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Varjani et al., 2020). 379 Nowadays, synthetic dyes are produced in such a way that they resist degradation and 380 because of this degradation of dye by traditional techniques is becoming time and efforts 381 consuming (Saxena et al., 2019). Each microorganism has different capability of dye 382 degradation, detoxification and decolorization. Bacteria are most widely used for 383 bioremediation (Kumar et al., 2020). Genetic engineering has made a significant revolution 384  18 in field of bioremediation (Mishra et al., 2020). Dye degradation/decolorization can be 385 improved using genetically modified organisms under environmental conditions. GMOs 386 can be produced by transferring gene from one species to another species or by gene 387 modification (Peter et al., 2011; Tahri et al., 2013; Saxena et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). 388 To design GMO, functional gene of various bacterial strains has been used such as 389 Sphingomonas desiccabilis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus idriensis, Pseudomonas putida, 390 Mycobacterium marinum, Ralstonia eutropha, etc. and transferred into other species 391 (Saxena et al., 2019). Various genetic tools and techniques are available to identify 392 expression of microbial genome such as single-stranded conformation polymorphism, 393 randomly ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 16S rDNA 394 sequencing and other new sequencing technologies (Urgun-Demirtas et al., 2006; Holst-395 Jensen et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2020). Sandhya (2008), produced Escherichia coli SS125 396 for degradation of Remazol red dye by transferring azoreductase gene form Bacillus 397 latrosporus RRK1 to Escherichia coli DH5a and Plasmid pAZR-SS125. Jin et al. (2009), 398 have constructed genetically modified E. coli JM109 (pGEX-AZR) in laboratory which 399 shows decolorization of direct blue 71. It was achieved by inserting azoreductase gene in 400 expression vector pGEX4T-1. Vector was than expressed and transformed in E. coli JM109 401 under control of a lac operon. Ajaz et al. (2020), reported degradation of Remazol red in 402 presence of 0.8 mg/L dissolve oxygen with help of azoreductase gene which was replicated 403 from Bacillus latrosporus RRK1 and integrated in Escherichia coli. Degradation of various 404 dyes using genetically modified microorganisms including details of host microorganism, 405 donor microorganism, desired gene and vector used has been shown in Table 2 406  407  19  408  409 8. Microbial degradation of dyes: Gaps and future needs 410  411 To achieve better results in biodegradation of dyes, further research work is 412 necessary such as (a) responsible micro-organisms, (b) limitation of experimental factors, 413 (c) site for bioremediation and (d) degradation pathways before applying micro-organisms 414 in the field. It would be of utmost importance to determine the nature of the degradation 415 products and to establish their (non) toxicity to aquatic or plant life. Many microbial 416 degradation techniques have been resisted by dyes, there is a new way to degrade dyes 417 through genetic engineering, which opens a new arena for researchers working in this field. 418 With the use of advanced molecular biology tools responsible genes/enzymes for dye 419 degradation can be studied. Dye degradation may produce by-products, nutrients and 420 energy which can be used as resources. Complete dye degradation is a challenge for 421 researchers. Successful application of biodegradation of dye wastewater requires a number 422 of research studies that need to be pursued.  423 • Future studies on dye degradation should be aimed to reduce limitation of 424 factors upon microbial activities. 425 • Re-examination of recent and early successful studies is required to improve 426 them for enhanced efficiency.   427 • Effective biodegradation process should consider degradation pathways, 428 environmental factors, degradation rate and degradation mechanisms that affect 429  20 removal of pollutants. It would be highly imperative to ensure that the degraded 430 products have no toxicity on aquatic life or plants. 431 • Integration of treatment technologies for dye pollutants is highly desirable for 432 effective translation to industries. 433 • Study of mechanisms and theories for bacterial degradation of dye wastewater 434 would help to explore bacterial degradation kinetics. 435  436 4. Conclusions 437  438 Disposal of wastewater generated by dye industries into environment without proper 439 treatment impacts harmfully the soil and water environment. This demands to invent sustainable 440 green processes to remediate the hazardous chemical compounds present in the effluent. Biological 441 treatments offer potential benefits compared to physical and chemical treatment methods. 442 Biological wastewater treatments have been demonstrated using microbial consortia or 443 single microbial strain having capabilities for dye degradation. In this regard, use of 444 genetically modified organisms could be of added advantage to enhance the process 445 efficiency of degradation. Integration of technologies is yet another important aspect, which 446 could bring potential benefits. Advanced technologies and materials need to be developed 447 for effective degradation of dyes in industrial wastewater.  448  449 Acknowledgements 450  21 Authors are grateful to the management of Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Gandhinagar, 451 Gujarat, India for providing necessary facilities to perform literature review presented in this 452 paper. 453  454 References 455 1) Abe, F.R., Machado, A L., Soares, A.M.V.M., de Oliveira, D.P., Pestana, J.L.T., 456 2019.
