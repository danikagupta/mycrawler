The chitosan availability in adsorption of C.I. Reactive Red 3-18159 (RR-3) and C.I. Direct Brown 95-30145 (DB-95) 
dyes from aqueous solutions was investigated by using the batch method. Experiments were carried out as a function of 
contact time, dye concentrations and temperature. The influence of pH and sodium chloride concentration were also 
investigated. The adsorption parameters were determined based on Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms obtained from the equilibrium adsorption data for the reactive dye and for the direct dye, while the kinetic and thermodynamic 
parameters were used to establish the adsorption mechanism. As an adsorbent, chitosan was found to prefer the RR-3 
dye, retaining up to 151.52 mg textile dye per gram at 20 °C, whereas a retention of only 41.84 mg textile dye per gram at 50 °C has been achieved for DB-95 dye.

INTRODUCTION 
The presence of synthetic textile dyes in 
industrial aqueous effluents causes serious 
environment pollution, because most of them are 
recalcitrant, toxic and highly resistant to 
degradation compounds. This is why, the efficient 
treatment of such industrial wastewaters is 
currently in real demand.1-3  
The adsorption process has been considered 
one of the most efficient methods for removing 
dye pollutants from wastewater. The use of 
activated carbon as adsorbent for dyes is an 
efficient solution, but its cost is still a major 
disadvantage. A convenient alternative for decoulorising wastewaters consists in the use of non-conventional adsorbents with lower cost and 
high efficiency, like natural biopolymers.
4 A 
derivative of chitin, chitosan, appears to be more 
attractive, since chitin is a biopolymer that is 
naturally available in abundance. Chitosan can be obtained by the deacetylation of chitin and due  to  
its unique molecular structure (high contents of 
amino and hydroxyl functional groups) it has a 
high affinity for many classes of dyes. Chitosan 
has drawn particular attention due to its efficiency   
as biosorbent and to its low cost compared to activated carbon. 
A considerable number of studies report the 
results obtained in the use of chitosan and its 
grafted and crosslinked derivatives for removing 
dyes from aqueous solutions.
5-10 The biosorption 
performance of chitosan and its derivatives is 
influenced by several parameters, such as 
chitosan characteristics, process variables, dye 
chemistry and the solution conditions used in the 
study.  The effectiveness of chitosan also depends 
on the natural source from which it has been 
obtained and on its form (gels, flakes, powders, particles). 
Reactive dyes have come to be of interest 
since they may cause serious environmental 
problems. A remarkable performance achieved 
for certain types of chitosan has been reported, for 
example, crosslinked chitosan beads have an adsorption capacity in the range 1640- 2480 mg g

immobilized chitosan on glass plates and obtained 
a maximum adsorption capacity of 172.41 mg g-1

 358 interesting interaction between chitosan and 
Reactive Black 5 dye, as to the sorption of the dye 
on solid chitosan using sulphuric acid for pH 
control.12 Also, when using chitosan flakes as 
adsorbent for Reactive Red dye and Reactive Blue dye, the adsorption capacity achieved was of 
22.48 mg·g
-1 and 70.08 mg·g-1, respectively.13 
Szyguła et al.14 used chitosan in a dissolved state 
in coagulation–flocculation processes for the removal of certain dyes from acidic solutions and observed that Reactive Black 5 required a short 
time to settle down. The investigation of the 
dynamic sorption of Reactive Black 5 onto 
chitosan showed that the adsorption efficiency 
and elution efficiency were always higher than 
80% in each cycle.
15 Crosslinked chitosan with 
glutaraldehyde in the presence of magnetite was 
chemically modified to chitosan/amino resin and 
chitosan bearing both amine and quaternary ammonium chloride moieties, respectively. The uptake of Reactive Black 5 from aqueous 
solutions using both resins was studied and 
showed high affinity for the adsorption of reactive 
dye.
16 The chitosan-graft poly(methylmetha-
crylate) was found a much more efficient adsorbent than the parent chitosan for three 
anionic azo dyes (Procion Yellow MX, Remazol 
Brilliant Violet and Reactive Blue H5G) over a 
wide pH range of 4-10, the best results being 
achieved at pH 7.
17 
The number of studies devoted to direct dye 
adsorption is small, compared to the papers about 
reactive dyes. Direct Blue 78 dye removal from 
textile wastewater, using chitosan was studied.18 
the adsorption of Direct Red 23 dye and Acid 
Green 25 dye in single and binary systems was found to follow the Tempkin isotherm and the adsorption kinetics to conform to a pseudo-
second-order model. The main characteristics of 
the composites made from chitosan and zinc 
oxide nanoparticles (biocompatibility, low cost and eco-friendliness) strongly recommend these 
adsorbents as a suitable alternative for the 
elimination of Direct Blue 78 from aqueous 
solutions.
19 The adsorption/desorption behavior of 
different adsorbents and dyes in aqueous solutions was studied.
20 The preparation and 
characterization of a new s-IPN composite 
hydrogel, based on polyacrylamide and chitosan, 
and its interaction with Direct Blue 1 dye were also reported.
21 
The present paper describes the adsorption 
behavior of Reactive Red 3 (RR-3) dye and Direct 
Brown 95 (DB-95) dye towards chitosan. The 
influence of some factors, such as pH, dye 
concentration, contact time, temperature and 
concentration of sodium chloride, on chitosan 
adsorption capacity for the two dyes, has been 
investigated. The kinetics and thermodynamic 
parameters that characterize the adsorption processes were estimated. It has been noted that the two dyes in the study were not mentioned in 
literature, as far as the possibility of their removal 
with chitosan and its derivatives is concerned.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL  
Materials and methods  
Chitosan 
Chitosan (CH-69) with an acetylation degree of 
34% and a relative molecular weight (g mol-1) of 
350000 was obtained from Vanson Co., Canada. The 
chitosan flakes were ground and sieved to 100-150 mesh diameter. The structure of the used adsorbent is 
shown in Figure 1a.  
 
Dyes 
Two commercial dyes, C.I. Reactive Red 3-18159 
(RR-3) and C.I. Direct Brown 95-30145 (DB-95), whose structures are shown in Figure 1b and c, were 
purchased from the Faculty of Textiles – Leather and 
Industrial Management, Iasi, Romania, in the form of 
sulphonic acid salts, which determines their solubility in water.

 359 
DB-95 direct dye has one sulphonic group and RR-3 reactive dye has three sulphonic groups, their 
molecular weights (g mol
-1) being of 774 and 602, 
respectively. Aqueous solutions of 1000 mg L-1 textile 
dye (used without preliminary purification) were 
prepared using double-distilled water and then diluted 
when necessary. The aqueous dye solution with an initial concentration of 100 mg L
-1 had an initial pH of 
5.15 for RR-3 dye and 6.06 for DB-95 dye. 
 
Adsorption kinetics  
Adsorption kinetics experiments were carried out 
using the batch method. The effect of contact time on 
the removal of both dyes was followed by shaking (on a rotating shaker) an aqueous dye solution without pH 
correction (100 mL) of known concentration, into 
which 0.12 g chitosan at a constant temperature (20 °C) was introduced. The st irring speed was kept 
constant at 400 rpm. At predetermined intervals of 
time, the samples were taken and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. The corresponding absorbance dye 
concentration left in the solution was measured 
spectrophotometrically with a UV-Vis 1700 Pharma Spec spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 
532 nm for RR-3 and 400 nm for DB-95 dye. Then, the 
amount of the adsorbed dye at time t, q
t (mg g-1) was 
determined by the following relation:  

wVC Cqt 0
t                (1) 
where C0 and Ct are the initial concentration and 
concentration at time t in the dye solution (mg L-1), 
respectively, V is the volume of solution (L), w is the 
mass of adsorbent used (g). 
The equilibrium time established between chitosan 
and the dye solutions was subsequently used in the isotherm experiments.  
Equilibrium studies 
The adsorption isotherms were obtained by 
employing 0.03 g of chitosan and 25 mL aqueous 
solution of dye with various concentrations. The 
solutions were stirred until they reached adsorption equilibrium and then the same procedure as that 
described above was followed. The tested temperatures 
were in the range 20-50 °C. 
The adsorption capacity of chitosan was evaluated 
by the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium by the 
relation:  

wVC Cqe 0
e                (2) 
where qe is the amount of dye adsorbed per weight unit 
of adsorbent at equilibrium (mg g-1), C0 and Ce are the 
initial and equilibrium concentrations of dye in 
solution (mg L-1), V is the volume of solution (L), w is 
the mass of adsorbent used (g). 
 
 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Effect of contact time and initial dye 
concentration 
The influence of contact time on the 
adsorption of both dyes onto chitosan from 
aqueous solutions with initial concentrations 
between 20-100 mg L-1 was observed under 
constant conditions, as th ose mentioned above. As 
shown in Figure 2 (a, b), dye adsorption is 
correlated with both the concentration of dyes and 
contact time. The contact time curves are smooth 
and continuous, leading to equilibrium. It is also obvious that the q
t value increases with the initial 
concentration of the two dyes and then tends to a 
plateau, when it can be assumed that there is a 
saturation of the adsorption sites on the adsorbent. 
Thus, the RR-3 dye at low concentration (20-30 
mg L-1) is quantitatively removed in 45-50 
minutes. For the DB-95 dye, the time necessary to 
reach equilibrium is higher for the same 
concentrations (~80 minutes). The amount of 
retained dye did not change even if contact time 
was extended, which prov es that saturation was 
reached, as mentioned above. Also a higher rate of adsorption for RR-3 on chitosan was noted. 
 Kinetic models 
The kinetic analysis of DR-95 and RR-3 
adsorption onto chitosan was performed using the 
pseudo-first-order model proposed by 
Lagergreen,
22 pseudo-second-order model 
proposed by Ho and McKay,23 the Elovich kinetic 
model24 and the intraparticle diffusion model.25 
The adsorption dynamics can be appreciated 
by determining the adsorption rate constant using 
a linear form of the Lagergreen equation (3).

where qe and qt are the amounts of dye adsorbed 
(mg g-1) at equilibrium and at time t, respectively, 
and k1 is the rate constant.       
The pseudo-first-order kinetics constant k1 
(min-1) values were calculated from the slopes of 
the linear plot of log (q e-qt) versus t and qe 
corresponding model ( qec) from intercept (Figure 
3a and b).

the adsorption kinetics corresponding to the

The linear plot of t/qt versus t allows the 
calculation of k2, qec values. Also, the initial 
adsorption rate h (mg g-1 min-1) can be obtained 
by:

e2qkh               (5) 
Elovich equation has been used to interpret the 
kinetics of adsorption. It has been found useful in 
describing the predominantly chemical adsorption on highly heterogeneous adsorbents. The linear form of Elovich equation is given by:   
tln1) ln(1qt               (6) 
where α represents the initial adsorption rate (mg 
g−1 min−1) and the β is related to the extent of 
surface coverage and activation energy for 
chemisorption (g mg-1). Elovich parameters α and β could be computed from the plots of  qt versus 
lnt. 
Table 1 shows that the values of the 
determination coefficients R2 of the pseudo-
second-order model are all higher than those of the first-order model. The experimental data 
follow the linear relationship of pseudo-second-
order adsorption model. By comparing the 
equilibrium concentration values determined  
experimentally ( q
e) with those calculated ( qec), a 
good agreement has been observed for RR-3 dye 
(Figure 3 c), but there are great differences for all 
concentrations of DB-95 dye. The k2 rate 
constants decreased with the increase in the initial 
dye concentration. For the smaller concentration 
of the dyes, maximum k2 values of 2.2·10-2 mg g-1 
min-1 were observed for DB-95 dye and of 
1.23·10-3 mg g-1min-1 for RR-3 dye.

For the direct dye, although R2 values of the 
first-order model are lower than those of the 
model Ho, qec values for this model are estimated 
to be more accurate. The maximum k1 value for 
the adsorption of Direct Blue A dye by the same 
type of chitosan has been reported as 3.74·10-2 
min-1 for the same concentration.26 
The Elovich model allows the assessment of 
heat of adsorbent-adsorbate interactions. Due to these interactions, the heat of adsorption of all 
molecules in the layer decreased linearly with the increase of initial adsorption rate.
27 For the two 
dyes, it was noticed that β values decreased with 
the increase in the initial dye concentration, while 
the initial adsorption rate ( α) increased under the 
same conditions (Table 1, Figure 3 d and e). 
The mechanism of dye adsorption on chitosan 
is complex. It primarily involves the surface 
physical adsorption on biosorbent, but there exists 
the possibility of a covalent binding of dyes on the substrate that occurs simultaneously with the 
exchange process. At pH 6, only part of amine MAURUSA-ELENA IGNAT et al. 
 362 groups will be protonated and will be available 
for electrostatic interaction.5  
In general, dye adsorption on an adsorbent 
material may be assumed to involve four steps,5 
of which film diffusion (diffusion of dye through the boundary layer to the su rface of the adsorbent) 
and pore diffusion or intraparticle diffusion 
(transport of the dye from the surface into the 
pores of the particle) are essential for establishing the mechanism. 
The diffusion mechanism can be identified by 
using the intraparticle diffusion model proposed 
by Weber and Morris.
25

id t               (7) 
where kid is the intraparticle diffusion rate 
constant (mg g-1 min-0. 5) and I is the intercept (mg 
g-1). 
If the rate-controlling step is an intraparticle 
diffusion, a plot of dye adsorbed ( qt) against 
square root of contact time ( t0.5) leads to a straight 
line passing through the origin.28 When the plots 
do not pass through the origin, it is an indication 
of some degree of boundary layer control and of 
the fact that the intraparticle diffusion is not the 
only rate-limiting step. In this case, the adsorption 
process is complex and more kinetic models that operate simultaneously may control the rate of 
dye adsorption. 
The rate constants of intraparticle diffusion 
(kid) for both dyes were obtained from the linear 
part of the plots qt vs. t1/2 for different 
concentrations of dyes (Table 3). In the range of 
initial dye concentration of 20-100 mg L-1, the 
values for kid1 increase with increasing dye 
concentration, which corresponds to an enhanced diffusion of dye molecules from the outer surface of the adsorbent into macropores. For initial 
concentrations between 60-100 mg L
-1 of RR-3 
dye, two separate regions are found in the plot 
(Figure 3 c); namely, the first straight part can be 
attributed to the macropore diffusion (rate 
constant kid1) and the second linear portion to 
micropore diffusion (rate constant kid2). The 
values of intercept for RR-3 dye are higher than 
those for DB-95 dye, which shows a greater contribution to the surface adsorption in the rate-controlling step. 
The determination coefficients R
2 for the 
intraparticle diffusion model are lower than those 
for the pseudo-second-order model for RR-3 dye 
and for the pseudo-first-order model for DB-95 dye.

The different behavior of chitosan towards the 
two dyes can be correlated with their structure and molecular weight, because they belong to 
distinct classes of dyes in terms of tinctorial Chitosan 
 363properties. Cheung et al .29 have established that 
during acid dye adsorption onto chitosan, the 
mechanism was predominantly intraparticle 
diffusion, but there was also a dependence on 
pore size as the dye diffuses into macropores, mesopores and micropores, respectively.  
Adsorption isotherms  
Generally, adsorption isotherms describe the 
way pollutants interact with the adsorbent materials, and thus are critical for the 
optimization of the adsorption mechanism 
pathways, emphasizing the surface and capacities 
of adsorbents and the effective design of the 
adsorption systems.
30 
 Langmuir isotherm 
Experimental data regarding the adsorption of 
dyes considered in the study on chitosan at different temperatures were analyzed by the Langmuir equation (8):
31 
ee L
eCb1CKq              (8) 
where KL – Langmuir constant (L g-1); Ce – dye 
solution concentration at equilibrium (mg L-1); qe 
– the amount of retained dye (mg g –1 sorbent) at 
equilibrium; b – adsorption coefficient (L mg-1). 
A linearized form of equation (8) can be 
obtained as follows: 
Le
L ee
KCb
K1
qC               (9) 
A plot of Ce/qe vs Ce leads to a straight line 
with the b/K L slope and an intercept with an 
ordinate equal to KL-1. The qm maximum capacity 
of adsorption (mg dye g-1 adsorbent) is computed 
by means of the relation:  
bq Km L             (10) 
From the Langmuir plot for adsorption of both 
dyes at different temperatures, the Langmuir 
parameters were obtained (Table 3). A maximum 
adsorption capacity of chitosan of 151.52 mg g –1 
for RR-3 reactive dye was reached at 20 °C. The 
qm and KL values are shown to decrease when the 
temperature rises from 20 °C to 40 °C. The fact 
that the adsorption of RR-3 dye is not favored by 
increasing temperature indicates that the process 
is exothermic. The Langmuir isotherms obtained 
from experimental data of direct dye DB-95 
adsorption on chitosan reflect the fact that 
increasing the temperature from 20 °C to 50 °C 
leads to qm values from 36.10 to 41.84 mg g-1. 
Simultaneously, the values of KL are found to be 
intensified.  The essential characteristic  trait of a Langmuir 
isotherm expressed in terms of a dimensionless 
separation factor ( RL) can be computed by the 
relation: 
0LbC11R             (11)  
The computed values of RL (Table 3) in the 
range (0-1) confirmed that the adsorption 
behaviour of the chitosan adsorbent was favorable 
for both dyes. 
There is also evidence of higher adsorbent 
affinity for the reactive dye. The different 
behavior of the same adsorbent towards the two 
dyes RR-3 and DB-95 under investigation belong 
to different classes in terms of tinctorial 
properties, have different structures and their 
maximum adsorption capacity is related to their 
chemical structure, to the dimensions of the dye 
organic chains and the number and positioning of the dye functional groups (Figure 1b,c).  
In the dyeing process, generally for reactive 
dyes, covalent bonds between the reactive groups 
of the dye and the fiber are formed; namely -OH 
groups of cellulose fibers (cotton, viscose, flax, 
hemp) and -NH
2 or -OH groups of wool, silk, 
polyamide.32-34 The retention of direct dye anions 
is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and 
van der Waals forces with cellulose fibers favored 
by the coplanar structure of linear and direct 
dyes.32 
 
Freundlich isotherm 
The study of Freundlich isotherm was 
performed by the equation: 
e F e Clogn/1 Klog qlog             (12) 
where qe is the amount of adsorbed dye (mg L-1) 
at equilibrium; KF and n are constants that reflect 
adsorption capacity and intensity of adsorption, respectively. The K
F and n constants were 
computed from the intercept and slope, 
respectively, of the linear plots for log q e vs. Ce 
(Table 4). The n values ranging between 1 and 10 
indicate a favorable adsorption for both dyes. 
 
Thermodynamics 
For RR-3 dye the thermodynamic parameters 
of the adsorption process can be evaluated by 
using the van’t Hoff equation with the values of K
L obtained at different temperatures:5,35

L             (13)    MAURUSA-ELENA IGNAT et al. 
 364 where ΔH0 and ΔS0 are enthalpy and entropy 
changes, respectively. R is the gas constant (8.314 
J mol-1 K-1) and T is absolute temperature (K). 
The dependence log K L versus 1/T(K) is 
represented in Figure 4, where the slope of the straight line is ΔH
0/2.303R . The ΔH0 value of -
13.24 kJ mol-1 for RR-3 dye was obtained. The 
negative value of this parameter indicates the heat 
releasing during adsorption and the exothermic nature of the process. From the intercept with ordinate  (ΔS
0/2.303R) the negative value 
computed of ΔS0 (-37.62 j K-1mol-1) shows that the 
randomness at the solid chitosan–RR-3 dye 
solution interface decreases during the adsorption 
for the system under consideration.  The Gibbs free energy change ( ΔG0) was 
computed as follows: 
0 0 0ST H G              (14) 
For the range of temperature from 293K to 
313K, ΔG0 varies from -2.21 to -1.46 kJ mol-1. 
The negative values of ΔG0 confirm the feasibility 
of the process and the spontaneous nature of the adsorption of RR-3 dye onto  chitosan. In addition, 
the considerably low ΔG
0 values illustrate the 
saturation in the adsorption process.36 Nawi et 
al.11 also reported a similar observation for the 
adsorption of Reactive Red 4 by immobilized chitosan on glass plates.

Effect of pH 
The initial pH of a dye solution is one of the 
most important parameters affecting the 
adsorption process because pH influences the 
chemistry of both chitosan adsorbent and dye molecules in an aqueous solution. The effect of 
pH on chitosan adsorption capacity was studied in 
the range 2.5-7.0 (acidity was corrected with 
solutions 10
-1-10-3 M H 2SO 4). Other mineral or 
organic acids cannot be used because chitosan is solubilised totally or partly.
37,12  
The changes in the adsorption of RR-3 and 
DB-95 dyes over a pH range of 2.5-7.0 on 
chitosan are depicted in Figure 5. For DB-95 it 
was observed that for a pH of 2.5 there were a lot 
of fine particles in suspension in the solution, 
which proves the instability of the dye in acidic 
solutions. This may be the reason that no 
adsorption occurred at this pH. 
The quantities of the dye adsorbed increase 
with decreasing acidity, until a pH of 5.0 is 
reached for RR-3 dye and of 6.0 for DB-95 dye. Above these values, the adsorption of dyes 
decreases with increasing pH. Also, one can see 
that under these experimental conditions, RR-3 
dye retention is greater than that of DB-95 dye. 
The optimum pH reported for chitosan in the case 
of Reactive Red 4 was 6.0 11 and for Direct Red 
23 was 2.0.18 
From Figure 5, it may be observed that the 
final pH after the adsorption of both dyes 
increases for an initial pH range of 3.3-5.5. 
Sakkayawong et al . 38 also reported that the 
solution pH changes during RR141 reactive dye adsorption onto chitosan. The explanation for this 
is that under acidic conditions hydrogen ions in 
the solution could protonate the amine groups of 
the biopolymer and thus cause the increased pH. 
The initial tests in the pH  range of 8-11 led to 
results that show that a decrease in adsorption 
capacity can be attributed to a competition 
between the OH
- ions in basic medium and the 
anions of dyes for the positively charged 
adsorption sites, which could lead to a decrease of 
biosorption capacity. Chitosan 
 365The influence of pH in the adsorption 
processes is due to both the dye and chitosan. In 
aqueous solutions with different pH, dye 
dissociation occurs as a function of their acid-
base characteristic tra its. The strongly acidic 
sulphonate groups of the dyes were dissociated and converted to anionic dye ions. At the same 
time, the chitosan in an acid medium undergoes 
protonation at nitrogen atoms, which favors the 
adsorption dye anion by ion exchange process 
according to the general equilibrium:5 
 
The presence of carboxyl groups in DB-95 dye 
can contribute to the adsorption mechanism 
through the electrostatic interaction between 
COO- reactive groups of dye and protonated 
chitosan, but it should be noted that the 
involvement of strongly dissociated sulfonic 
groups is much higher than that of partially 
dissociated carboxyl groups. Also, it was 
observed that the two dyes contain different numbers of groups (-OH, -NH-, -N=N-) that can 
participate at the formation of covalent, 
coulombic, hydrogen bonding or van der Waals 
forces.39  
Crini and Badot5 point out that the accessible 
amine groups in chitosan are in the main reactive 
groups for anionic dye adsorption, although 
hydroxyl groups (especially in the C-3 position) 
may contribute to adsorption.

Effect of ionic strength 
In typical dyeing systems, certain electrolytes 
are known to affect dye adsorption on fibers. 
Different concentrations of sodium chloride, 
between 4 and 20 g L-1, are observed to decrease 
the adsorption of both dyes on chitosan (Figure 
6). In the case of RR-3, the effect of NaCl is 
much stronger, as compared to DB-95 dye. As the 
concentration of NaCl increased from 0 to 4 g L-1, 
the retained amount of RR-3 dye diminished to almost a half and then it remained constant, allowing the growth of electrolyte amount to 20 g 
L
-1. A similar behavior was found by Gao et al. 40 
for Acid Yellow 17 dye adsorbed on activated 
sludge. The author explained that in the presence of NaCl, the common ion effect of Na
+ caused a 
decrease of dye dissociation and, as a result, the 
dye biosorption on non-living aerobic granular 
sludge was reduced. In solution, this effect would 
reduce the electrostatic attraction force between 
R–NH 3 + and Dye–SO 3−.  
The same amount of NaCl reduced 
insignificantly the adsorption of direct dye DB-
95. The adsorption capacities of the native or 
heat-treated fungal biomass to Direct Blue 1 and 
Direct Red 128 dyes were not significantly 
affected by increasing ionic strength (NaCl from 
0 to 0.5 M).41 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The batch adsorption studies have shown that 
the adsorption of Reactive Red 3 and Direct 
Brown 95 dyes from aqueous solution is influenced by the contact time, initial dye concentration, pH, temp erature and addition of 
sodium chloride. According to the experimental 
data, the adsorption processes follow a pseudo-
second-order model for Reactive Red 3 and a 
pseudo-first-order one for Direct Brown 95 dye. Furthermore, the Langmuir and Freundlich 
isotherm models fit with our results and could 
well describe the adsorption of these dyes onto 
chitosan. Intraparticle diffusion has an important 
role in the adsorption me chanism, together with 
ion-exchange mechanisms. Since temperature 
values influence the process as a function of the 
dye type, the maximum adsorptive capacity was 
determined to be of 151.52 mg g
-1 for Reactive 
Red 3 at 20 °C, and of 41.84 mg g-1 for Direct 
Brown 95 at 50 °C, respectively. These results demonstrate that the adsorption of the two dyes 
on chitosan depends on their particular structure.
