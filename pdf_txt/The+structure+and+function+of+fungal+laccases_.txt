Introduction
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2, p-diphenol:
dioxygen oxidoreductase) are a group ofmulti-copper containing enzymes that cata-lyze one-electron oxidation of phenoliccompounds with concomitant reduction ofoxygen to water. Fungi are the main pro-ducers of laccase, especially Basidi-omycetes. Laccases play an important rolein lignification and delignification in nature.Due to their broad substrate specificity,which can be further extended to variousrecalcitrant non-phenolic compounds in thepresence of mediators, laccases are widelyused in many industrial processes and en-vironmental bioremediations. Their com-
mercial applications are found in the pulpand paper industry, biobleaching, biosensingand beverage refining. Laccases havebeen applied in removal of a large numberof environmental pollutants, such as alk-enes, chlorophenols, dyes, herbicides, poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ben-zopyrene (Cuoto and Herrera, 2006;Gianfreda et al., 1999). For these reasonsfor the last decades laccases focused sci-entific attention. Laccase's structure, modeof action, mediator systems and enzymeproperties have been reviewed many times(Duran et al., 2002, Messerschmidt, 1993;Solomon et al., 1996). The review of Cuoto76 V . K. Gochev and A. I. Krastanov
and Herrera (2006) summarized in a bril-
liant way the information of laccase appli-cations.
The aim of present review is to gather
the scientific information for structure,mode of action and mainly biotechnologi-cal producing of fungal laccases.
Structure and Classification
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2, p-diphenol:
dioxygen oxidoreductase) are a group ofmulti-copper containing enzymes that cata-lyze one-electron oxidation of phenoliccompounds with concomitant reduction ofoxygen to water, and whose active site issimilar to that of ascorbatoxidase, cerulo-plasmin and bilirubin oxidase. All fungallaccases are glycoproteins (Mayer &Staples, 2002). The catalytic site of laccaseis quite conserved among different spe-cies, but the rest of the enzyme structureshows high diversity. Fungal laccases aremostly inducible, extracellular, monomericglycoproteins with carbohydrate contentsof 8%- 50% (Heinzkill et al., 1996) andare multinuclear enzymes (Gayazov andRodakiewicz-Nowak, 1996). Typically themolecular mass of fungal laccases is from60 to 80 kDa (Heinzkill et al., 1998;Leontievsky et al., 1997 and Thurston,1994). However, atypical fungal laccaseshave also been reported; for example, a390 kDa laccase of Podospora anserine
(Thruston, 1994) while laccase of Botrytis
cinerea  was previously reported as small
as 38 and 36 kDa. Laccases from thesame fungal species were reported to con-tain 49-91 % reducing-sugar content(Slomczynski et al., 1995). The tetrierystructure of laccase has been determinedby X-rays crystallography (Bertrand et al.,2002 and Piontek et al., 2002). Typicallythe active site of laccase comprises fourCu atoms in three groups. Cu atoms differ
from each other in their electron paramag-netic resonance (EPR) signals (Gianfredaet al., 1991). Type I Cu exists in its oxi-dized form and is responsible for the bluecolour of the enzyme at 600nm and is EPRdetectible (Bertrand et al., 2002 andPiontek et al., 2002). Type II Cu iscolourless, but EPR detectible. Type IIICu exhibits a weak absorption at 600 nmbut has no EPR signal (Palmieri et al.,1998). The type II and type III Cu site areclosely together and form a trinuclear cen-tre (Leontievsky et al., 1999) that is in-volved in the catalytic mechanism of theenzyme action. Almost all fungi that havebeen examined produce more than oneisoform of laccase (Hoshida et al., 2002).
Redox potential (RP) of fungal laccases
range from 0.4 V to 0.8 V . Fungal laccaseswith RP between 0,4 and 0,6 V belong tothe "Low RP" group such as Coprinuscinereus whereas those with a RP be-tween 0,6 and 0,8 V are referred as "HighRP" laccase such Trametes versicolor(Klonowska et al., 2005). Except bluelaccase yellow laccase have also beenpurified from several fungi (Leontievskyet al., 1997 and Morohoshi et al., 1997).More interestingly white laccase wasfound to be produced by Pleurotus
ostearus .
Mode of Action and Mediators
Laccase only attacks the phenolic com-
pounds leading to C α oxidation, C α-Cβ
cleavage and aryl-alkyl cleavage.Laccases are able to reduce one moleculeof dioxygen to two molecules of waterwhile performing one electron oxidation ofa wide range of aromatic compoundswhich includes polyphenols (Bourbonnaisand Paice, 1996), methoxy-substituted77 Fungal Laccases
monophenols and aromatic amines
(Bourbonnais et al., 1995). This oxidationresults in an oxygen-centered free radi-cal, which can then be converted in a sec-ond enzyme-catalyzed reaction to quinine.Laccase catalysis is agreed to take placein three steps: 1. Type I Cu reduction bysubstrate. 2. Electron transfer from type ICu to the type II Cu and type III Cutrinuclear cluster. 3. Reduction of oxygento water at the trinuclear cluster(Gianfreda et al., 1999).
The substrate range of laccase can be
extended to non-phenolic subunits by theinclusion of mediators. Mediators are agroup of low molecular-weight organiccompounds that can be oxidized by laccasefirst and from highly active cation radicalsto reach with carious chemicals includingnon-phenolic compounds that laccasealone can not oxidase (Figure 1). The mostcommon synthetic mediators are 1-hydro-xybenzotriazole (HOBT), N-hydro-xyphthalimide (NHPI) and 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonat (ABTS) (Fig-
ure 2).
Distribution and Physiological Role
of Fungal laccases
Laccases are widely distributed in
fungi, higher plants, bacteria and insects.More than 60 fungal strains, belonging tovarious classes such as Ascomycetes,
Basidiomycetes  and Deuteromycetes ,
have been demonstrated to producelaccase (Gianfreda et al., 1999). The ma-jority of laccases characterized so far havebeen derived from fungi, especially white-rot Basidiomycetes  that are efficient lig-
nin degraders. Well-known laccase pro-ducers include fungi such as Agaricus
bisporus , Botrytis cinerea (Marbach et
al., 1984), Coprinus cinereus  (Schneider
et al., 1999), Neurispora crassa
(Froehner and Eriksson, 1974), Phlebia
radiate  (Niku-Paavola et al., 1990),
Pleurotus ostreatus  (Sannia et al., 1986),
Fig. 1. A comparison of catalytic mechanism of laccase between with and without mediators78
Picnoporus cinnabarius  (Eggert et al.,
1996) and Trametes  (Coriolus, Polyporus)
versicolor (Rogalski et al., 1991). Extra-cellular laccases are produced by Tricho-
derma atroviride  and T. harzianum
(Holker et al., 2002).
The physiological roles of fungal
laccases are various. Laccases fromwhite-rot fungi such as T. versicolor  and
P . cinnabarius , participate in lignin bio-
degradation, where they mainly oxydazethe phenolic subunit of lignin (Bourbonnaisand Paice, 1996; Thurston, 1994). In plant-pathogenic fungi, laccases are importantvirulence factors. The grapevine greymould B. cinerea , produces a laccase that
necessary for pathogenesis, and the roleof that laccase is presumably related todetoxification of toxic defense metabolitesproduced by the plant (Bar-Nun et al.,1988). Laccase have also been shown tobe important for pathogenesis in the chest-nut blight fungus Cryphonectria
parasitica (Mayer and Staples, 2002) and
in the human pathogen Cryptococcus
neoformans  (Williamson, 1994). In As-
pergillus nidulans , laccase activity is re-
lated to pigment production.
The role of laccases recently has been
reevaluated because new information ontheir biodegradative mechanisms has beenobtained in several fungal species(Bourbonnais and Paice 1992, Archibaldand Roy 1992, Leonowicz et al., 2001).Moreover, some genera of basidiomycetes,such as Pleurotus  spp., were found to lack
lignin peroxidases (Fukushima and Kirk,1995; Galliano et al., 1988; 1991), indicat-ing that different enzymes are probablyinvolved in lignin biodegradation and that,among these enzymes, laccases could playa key role. Studies on the enzymes se-creted by the basidiomycete fungusPleurotus ostreatus  have shown that theV . K. Gochev and A. I. Krastanov

concerted action of laccase and aryl-al-
cohol oxidase, produces significant reduc-tion in the molecular mass of solublelignosulphonates (Marzullo et al., 1995).
Production of Fungal Laccases
CultivationLaccases ere generally produced dur-
ing the secondary metabolism of differentfungi growing on natural substrate or insubmerged culture (Gayazov andRodakiewicz-Nowak, 1996). V arious cul-tivation parameters such as carbon limita-tion, nitrogen source and concentration andmicroelements influence laccase produc-tion. Gayazov and Rodakiewicz-Nowak(1996) reported faster laccase productionunder semi-continuous production withhigh aeration and culture mixing comparedto static conditions. It was found that theproduction of high titers of laccase wasnot dependent on high biomass yields.Some fungal strains were successfullycultivated in stirred tank reactors (Nuskeet al., 2001). Fed-batch cultivation wasused, too but cultivation conditions werenot described.
Influence of carbon and nitrogen
source on laccase production
The use of excessive concentrations of
glucose as carbon source in cultivation oflaccase producing fungal strains has aninhibitory effect on laccase production(Eggert et al., 1996). It was found that in-crease in the amount of glucose in themedia resulted in a delay of the laccaseproduction. An excess of sucrose or glu-cose reduce the production of laccase, asthese components allow constitutive pro-duction of the enzyme, but repress its in-duction. A simple but effective way toovercome this problem is the use of cellu-lose as carbon source during cultivation
(Egger et al., 1996). Fungal laccases areoften triggered by nitrogen depletion(Keyser et al., 1974) but it was also foundthat in some strains nitrogen concentra-tion had no effect on enzyme activity(Leathman and Kirk, 1983). Some authorsreported high laccase activity using lowcarbon to nitrogen ratio (Montiero et al.,1998) but other stated that high er laccaseactivity was achieved at high carbon tonitrogen ratio (Buswell et al., 1995).Laccase was also produced earlier whenthe fungus was cultivated in nitrogen richmedia rather than the nitrogen limitedmedia (Heinzkill et al., 1998).
Induction of laccase production
Laccase production has been found to
be highly dependent on the conditions forcultivation and nutritive media composition(Heinzkill et al., 1998; Xavier et al., 2001).Laccases were generally produced al lowconcentrations but higher yealds wereachieved with addition of various supple-ments to media (Lee et al., 1999). Theaddition of xenobiotic compounds such asxylidene, lignin, veratryl alcohol is knownto increase and induce laccase activity(Xavier et al., 2001). Some of these com-pounds affect the metabolism or growthrate while others, such as ethanol, indirectlytrigger laccase production (Lee et al.,1999). Lu et al. (1996) found that the ad-dition of cellobiose can induce profusebranching in certain Trametes  spp. and
consequently increase laccase activity.The addition of low concentrations of cop-per to the cultivation media of laccase pro-ducing fungi stimulates laccase production(Palmieri et al., 2000). Various basidi-omycetes, ascomycetes, and deutero-mycetes, grown in a sugar-rich liquid me-dium, were compared for laccase-produc-80
ing ability and for the inducing effect of
2,5-xylidine on laccase production. Clearstimulation of the extracellular enzymeformation by xylidine was obtained in thecultures of Fomes annosus , Pholiota
mutabilis , Pleurotus ostreatus,  and
Trametes versicolor , whereas Rhizocto-
nia praticola  and Botrytis cinerea  were
not affected by the xylidine, and in the caseof Podospora anserina  a decrease in
laccase activity was observed (Bollag andLeonowicz, 1984).
Influence of pH and temperature on
laccase production
There is not much information published
on the influence of pH on laccase produc-tion, but most reports indicated initial pHlevels set between pH 4.5 and pH 6.0 priorto inoculation (Thurston, 1994). The lev-els are not controlled during most cultiva-tion. It has been found that the optimal tem-perature for laccase production is between25 
oC and 30 oC (Pointing et al., 2000).
When cultivated fungi at temperatureshigher than 30 
oC the activity of lignolytic
enzymes was reduced (Zadrazil et al.,1999).
Commersial applications of laccase
The scientific interest to fungal laccases
is influenced by wide spectrum of laccaseapplications. Fungal laccases find applica-tions within food industry, pulp and paperindustry, textile industry, synthetic chem-istry, cosmetics, soil bioremediation, bio-degradation of xenobiotics and removal ofendocrine disruptors (Cuoto and Herrera,2006). Laccases are attractive, industri-ally relevant enzymes that can be used fora number of diverse applications, e.g. forbiocatalytic purposes such as delignifcationof lignocellulosics and cross-linking ofpolysaccharides, for bioremediation suchas waste detoxifcation and textile dye
transformation (Gianfreda et al., 1999), foruse in food technological, for personal andmedical care applications (Xu, 1999) andfor biosensor and analytical purposes(Yaropolov et al., 1994).
Conclusion
Laccases are a group of multi-copper
enzymes that catalyze the one electron oxi-dation of phenols and are produced mainlyby fungi. The broad commercial applica-tions of laccases concern a great scien-tific interest on this group of enzymes.Many factors such as producer strain,cultivation conditions, composition of nu-tritive media, pH and temperature affectfungal laccases production.
The effective use of industrial laccases
may be hindered by their non-reusability,and high sensitivity to denaturing agents.These undesirable restraints can be re-moved by use of modified or immobilizedlaccase. Many attempts have been madeto improve the storage and operational sta-bility of laccase, leading to lower cost andexpansion of its biotechnological and en-vironmental applications (Duran et al.,2002).
For this reason the nowadays re-
searches concerned on laccase are fo-cused on the isolation of new fungallaccase producers, isolation and expres-sion of laccase genes, genetic construc-tion of super producers strains and devel-opment of low cost and effective biotech-nological processes for laccase production.
