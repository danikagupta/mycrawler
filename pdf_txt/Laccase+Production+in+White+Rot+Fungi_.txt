Abstract  
White -rot-fungi (WRF) are the only organisms able to degrade the whole wood components  
(i.e. lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose). This ability is due to the secretion of extracellular non -
specific ligninolytic enzymes during their secondary metabolism usually triggered by nutrient 
exhaustion. The non -specificity of these enzymes enables th em to transform a great variety of 
recalcitrant and hazardous pollutants  such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, 
fuels, alkanes, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), explosives and synthetic dyes . In addition, their 
extracellular nature a llows WRF to access non -polar and insoluble compounds. This makes WRF 
very appealing  for their application to different industrial and biotechnological processes. Also, 
new potential commercial products and processes from the fungal treatment of lignocellu losic 
materials may arise . The implementation of such applications would contribute to the establishment  
of a more sustainable industry and the development of a circular economy.  
 
Key words  – biotechnology – degradation – lignin – ligninolytic enzymes – valorisation  
 
Introduction  
White -rot fungi (WRF), so -named because of the whitish colour of the delignified wood, are 
the only known organisms able to mineralise the recalcitrant and bulky heteropolymer lignin 
(Figure 1). This ability is due to the secretion  of extracellular non -specific enzymatic complexes 
during their secondary metabolism ( Wesenberg et al. 2003),  usually under limited nutrient 
availability (C:N ratio) with nitrogen being the limiting nutrient for fungal growth in most wood 
and soils (Kirk &  Farrell 1987). These enzymatic complexes mainly consist of lignin peroxidases 
(LiPs, EC 1.11.1.14), manganese -dependent peroxidases (MnPs, EC 1.11.1.13) and laccases 
(benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) together with acce ssory enzymes (Ruiz -Dueñas 
& Martínez 2009).  The non -specificity of these enzymes enables them to transform a great variety 
of persistent chemicals with a structure similar to lignin (Mansur et al. 2003). Furthermore, their 
extracellular nature allows the fungi to access non -polar and insoluble compounds (Levin et al. 
2003). This makes WRF very attractive for different industrial and biotechnological applications 
such as the production of biofuel from plant biomass, biopulping, biobleaching and the degradation 
of recalcitrant e nvironmental pollutants.  
WRF are ubiquitous in nature, particularly in hardwood forests as hardwood (e.g. birch and 
aspen) is more susceptible to the attack of WRF than softwood (e.g. spruce and pine) (Blanchette et 
al. 1990). WRF can degrade all wood comp onents (i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) or 
preferentially lignin. The former are named simultaneous or non -selective WRF and the latter Mycosphere 8(3) 456-466 (2017)  www.mycosphere.org   ISSN 2077 7019

 selective WRF. The selective WRF  are of special bioindustrial interest, since they remove lignin 
leaving the v aluable cellulose intact (Dashtban et al. 2010). There are also WRF  that cause both 
types of white -rot attack within one substrate (Blanchette 1984, Blanchette et al. 1985, Adaskaveg 
& Gilbertson 1986).  
The mechanisms on how WRF degrade lignin are not full y understood but the fungal strain, 
the origin of lignocellulose and the culture conditions play a major role in the process (van Kuijk et 
al. 2015). Also, individual fungi can considerably vary their ability to degrade specific substrates 
under the same e nvironmental conditions (Eriksson et al. 1990).  
 
Potential applications of white -rot fungi  
 
Bioremediation of environmental pollutants  
One of the main environmental problems facing the world nowadays is the pollution of soil, 
water and air by toxic chemica ls. Most of these chemicals are known to be carcinogenic and 
mutagenic posing a serious hazard to the ecosystem and human beings. Therefore such compounds 
have to be removed  before entering into the environment. However, the in -use techniques for the 
treatment of these type of compounds are rather costly, time -consuming, mostly ineffective and 
sometimes generate hazardous sub -products (Grassi et al. 2011). Consequently, alternative methods 
to remove these hazardous recalcitrant compounds are needed. In this  sense, the use of WRF  
represents a promising approach.  
Due to the similarity between the chemical structure of lignin and those of many recalcitrant 
pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, fuels, alkanes, 
polychlorinated b iphenyls (PCBs), explosives and synthetic dyes (Figure 2), the use of WRF for the 
degradation of such pollutants has been considered (Paszczynski et al. 1991). This feature is the 
greatest advantage of using WRF  in bioremediation, since a mixture of differ ent pollutants is 
usually found in most polluted sites (Mester & Tien 2000). Also, WRF can bear a broad range of 
environmental conditions and, in addition to this, they can use lignocellulose for growth making 
them suitable for inoculation into polluted so ils. Moreover, WRF  can exert a positive effect on the 
growth of the indigenous micro -organisms facilitating the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants.  
The first studies on pollutant degradation by WRF were performed with the white -rot fungus 
Phanerochaete  chrysosporium (Figure 3A),  which has become the model organism for lignin 
degradation studies (Bumpus et al. 1985) . Since them, other species of WRF with promising ability 
to degrade recalcitrant pollutants have been described, including species belonging  to the genera 
Pleurotus , Bjerkandera , Coriolopsis , Phlebia  and Trametes  (Rodr íguez et al. 2004). In particular, 
the non -selective white -rot-fungus Trametes versicolor  (Figure 3B) has been repeatedly used in 
assays as a WRF representative (Blanchette & Bur nes 1988).  
The biotransformation of pollutants by WRF  entails different processes started either by the 
ligninolytic enzymes or the mycelial -bound redox system that produce free radicals, which can then 
perform either another enzyme -catalysed oxidation or non-enzymatic transformations via enzyme 
combustion. However until whole pollutant mineralisation, the use of different toxicity tests are 
needed to ensure the safety of the by -products formed (Jurado et al. 2011).  
The ability of WRF to remove recalcitrant  pollutants from wastewater has shown to be a good 
alternative to traditional wastewater treatment technologies.  In addition, WRF have shown 
promising potential for the bioremediation of industrially -contaminated soils (Borràs et al. 2010; 
Anasonye et al. 2015). However, nowadays  bioremediation on a commercial scale uses prokaryotes 
with comparatively few recent attempts to use WRF despite their clear advantages for 
bioremediation over bacteria (Table 1). In addition, WRF treatments would expand the substra te 
range of current treatments by degrading pollutants that prokaryotes cannot (Pointing 2001). 
Nevertheless,  the use of WRF in bioremediation presents the following drawbacks: long growth 
cycle, requiring nitrogen limiting conditions, long hydraulic reten tion time (Banat et al.  1996, 
Saratale et al. 2009) and low pH for optimum enzyme activity (Doble & Kumar 2005) which make 
the maintenance of WRF in bioreactors problematic. Additionally, several  operational problems, 458 
 such as formation of mycelia aggregate s, electrode fouling and clogging, can made necessary the 
removal of fungal biomass from the bioreactors after short operation periods ( Karthikeyan & Sahu 
2014). Also , despite different authors have reported the potential of WRF to treat industrial 
wastewa ter, there are few studies at bioreactor scale operating in continuous mode and under non -
sterilised conditions. Therefore, the application of WRF at industrial scale remains as a technical 
challenge.  
 
Pulp and paper industry  
During pulp and paper producti on, it is necessary to separate the cellulose fibres from lignin. 
This is performed by using mechanical or chemical methods. In chemical pulping, lignin is 
solubilised by chemicals resulting in a brown residual material that must be removed to produce 
white paper. For this, elemental chlorine has been used for a long time but currently delignification 
with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide is being used. However, they are less efficient in achieving a 
high degree of brightness than the chlorine reagents.  
The tr eatment of wood chips with ligninolytic fungi prior to conventional pulping methods 
(mechanical, chemical or a combination of both) is named biopulping. WRF have been considered 
as potentially useful agents for biopulping because they reduce not only energ y consumption but 
also chemicals, thus, being environmentally -friendly in contrast with the conventional pulping. In 
addition, b iopulping not only removes lignin but also some of the wood extractives, thereby 
reducing the pitch content and effluent toxicit y (Ali & Sreekrishnan 2001).  
The biological deligni fication of wood by WRF was first considered by Lawson & Still 
(1957) at the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company Research Laboratory (now Westvaco Corp.) 
(Akhtar et al. 1998). Since then, many researchers  have studied the potential use of WRF in pulping 
processes and pilot mill trials have been started in the last decades (Farrell et al. 1997, Breen & 
Singleton 1999, Scott et al. 2002, Masarin et al. 2009).  The efficiency of fungal pre -treatment 
utilising different lignocellulosic materials has been described and several patents have been 
published, the one based on the use of Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  being the most optimised one 
(Gutiérrez et al. 2001). This species has also proven to be very competitiv e on both softwoods and 
hardwoods (Ferraz et al. 2007).  
The pre -treatment of wood chips by WRF has shown to improve the effectiveness of kraft 
pulping and paper brightness (Fonseca et al. 2014). Therefore it can be considered as a possible 
alternative to c hemical pulping since, in addition to this, it requires simpler equipment and 
produces an effluent with reduced BOD.  
 
Valorization of lignocellulosic wastes  
The accumulation of huge amounts of lignocellulosic wastes from human activity is 
considered a seri ous environmental problem (Dias et al. 2010). The major constituent of 
lignocellulosic materials is cellulose followed by hemicellulose and lignin (Figure 4). Cellulose and 
hemicellulose are macromolecules built from different sugars, whereas lignin is an aromatic 
polymer synthesised from phenylpropanoid precursors. The composition and proportions of these 
components vary between plants (Sá nchez et al. 2009). Lignin degradation by using chemical and 
physical methods is a process neither environmentally -friendly nor economical. The use of WRF is 
being considered as an attractive alternative to transform these wastes into value -added products.  
 
Production of relevant metabolites  
Different lignocellulosic wastes have been used as support -substrates for the prod uction of 
different metabolites of industrial or commercial interest by WRF, generally under solid -state 
fermentation (SSF) conditions. The use of such wastes not only reduces considerably de production 
costs but also helps to alleviate the economic and th e environmental problems caused by their 
disposal. Although most of the produced metabolites are ligninolytic enzymes (Rodr íguez -Couto & 
Sanrom án 2005) other value -added products such as organic acids are also obtained (Table 2). In 
addition, recently the application of bioactive compounds produced by WRF to the food and 459 
 pharmaceutical industry has impelled the search for novel bioactive compounds of fungal origin 
(Wong et al. 2010). Moreover, their production has become an important field in modern 
biotech nology. Thus, the white -rot-fungus Ganoderma lucidum  has been reported to produce 
several bioactive compounds with high therapeutic value (Paterson 2006). Also, recently the white -
rot fungus Cerrena unicolor  has shown to exhibit antiviral, immunomodulatory  and anticancer 
activities (Mizerska -Dudka et al. 2015).  
 
Bioethanol  
Biofuel production from renewable sources has received increased interest in recent years as 
an alternative to the use of fossil fuels in many countries. Lignocellulosic biomass, mostly f rom 
agricultural and forestry wastes, is rich in carbohydrates and widely available, thus, providing 
attractive feedstocks for ethanol production. To maximise the use of carbohydrates from the 
biomass a pre -treatment process is required. The current in use  technologies are costly hampering 
the commercialisation of bioethanol (Mosier et al. 2005). T his has impelled the search for 
alternative processes such as those based on WRF. Thus, several WRF, such as Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium , Pleurotus ostreatus , Trametes  versicolor , Cyathus stercoreus  and Ceriporiopsis 
subvermispora , have been studied for the pretreatment of different lignocellulosic wastes (Wan & 
Li 2012; Knežević  et al. 2013). However, despite that the use of WRF offers the following 
advantages over the current thermal or chemical pre -treament processes : simpler techniques, low 
energy requirements, no or reduced waste streams, reduced downstream processing co sts and no or 
reduced inhibitors to ethanol fermentation (Keller et al. 2003; Nigam & Pandey 2009), substantial 
holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) loss and long pre -treatment times are the main 
drawbacks of this process. So to ensure a cellulose -rich but highly deligni fied biomass for biofuel 
production, highly selective lignin degraders are preferred.  
 
Ruminant feed  
Cellulose and hemicellulose in most lignocellulosic wastes are highly linked to lignin which 
makes them dif ficult to digest by animal s (Arora & Sharma 2009). This hampers the use of such 
wastes by rumen microbes and currently chemical and/or physical treatments are used to degrade 
lignin ( Chaturvedi & Verma 2013). I n search for alternative treatments to the use of chemicals or 
expensive  physical treatments, the use of WRF is seen as a very attractive alternative. In particular 
to convert lignocellulosic wastes into ruminant feeding, selective lignin degraders are the preferred 
WRF since they left cellulose intact and, thereby, keep the e nergy value of such wastes. However, 
only small laboratory scale experiments involving singles substrates or fungal species have been 
conducted so far. Further optimisation is needed to develop an alternative treatment able to compete 
with the conventional  treatments (van Kuijk et al. 2015).  
 
Outlook  
The practical use of WRF for biotechnological applications holds great potential. However 
before this can become a reality, progress related to process optimisation and cost reduction is 
needed. Searching for n ovel micro -organisms, taking advantage of the enormous microbial 
diversity existing in aquatic and terrestrial environments, is also required. The ocean is an 
enormous reservoir of untapped micro -organisms.  
The advantages and disadvantages of using WRF or their enzymes in biotechnological 
applications should be evaluated before attempting industrial -scale operations. In comparison to 
fungal biomass, enzymes are still more expensive to produce at an industrial scale in spite of their 
potential for scaling up  through gene technologies. However with the increasing advances in 
enzyme immobilisation technologies, efficiency in enzyme reusing both in amount and activity is 
probably to be great er than that of fungal biomass.
