Synopsis  
Pursuant to sections 68 and 74 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , 1999  
(CEPA), the Minister of the Environmen t and the Minister of Health have conducted a 
screening assessment of 14 phthalate esters ( phthalates ), known collectively as the 
Phthalate Substance Grouping. Substances in this grouping were identified as priorities 
for assessment as they met categorizat ion criteria under subsection 73 (1) of CEPA or 
were considered a priority on the basis of other  human health concerns. This screening 
assessment follows the August 2015 publication of four state of the science (SOS) 
reports and an approach document for cum ulative risk assessment (CRA) of phthalates, 
and it presents information relevant to concluding on the substances in this grouping 
under section 64 of CEPA.  
The Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CAS RN1), Domestic Substances 
List (DSL) names an d acronyms for phthalates in the Phthalate Substance Grouping 
screening assessment are listed in the table below.

a This substance was not identified under subsection 73(1) of CEPA but was included in this assessment as it was 
considered a priority on the basis of other human health concerns.  
b For the purposes of the health review, DINP was included with the medium -chain phthalate esters subgroup , and for 
the purposes of the ecological review it was included  with the long -chain phthalate subgroup (see Environment 
Canada , Health Canada 2015 c for more details).   
Phthalates in the Phthalate Substance Grouping assessment were divided into short -
chain, medium -chain and long -chain subgroups, depending on the length of the carbon 
backbone in the ester side -groups. The primary b asis for the subgroups  from a health 
hazard perspective was a structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis using studies 
related to certain events in the mode of action for phthalate -induced androgen 
insufficiency during male reproductive development in the rat. From an ecological 
perspective, subgrouping was based primarily on differences in log K ow and water 
solubility and their resulting effects on bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity. Phthalates 
within each subgroup are likely to have similar chemical properties , while toxicological 
properties  are largely, but not exclusively, similar . The above table also identifies the 
subgroup to which each phthalate in the grouping was assigned.  
Fourteen additional phthalates on the DSL were included within the sco pe of the 
screening assessment in the context of their potential to contribute to cumulative risk 
from combined exposure  to phthalates . Substance identity information for the additional 
phthalates considered in this assessment is provided in the table belo w. Thirteen of the 
14 additional phthalates were not assessed  individually and therefore no conclusion s for 
them,  under section 64 of CEPA , were  made . The  remaining substance, DEHP, was 
previously assessed in 1994  under the Priority Substance List (PSL). This previous 
assessment concluded that DEHP is harmful to human health and meets the criteria 
under paragraph 64(c) of CEPA . However, at that time , there was insufficient 
information to provide an ecological concl usion. Information has since become available 
to support a conclusion on  its potential to cause harm to the environment .

Results from a CEPA section 71 survey for 2012 determined  that 6 of the 28 phthalates 
being considered in the assessment (DINP, DIDP, DUP, DEHP, D911P and DIUP) were 
manufactured in and/or imported into Canada in quantities greater than 10 million 
kg/year, while 7 (BCHP, CHIBP, DBzP, DMCHP, BIOP, DnHP and DPrP) were bel ow 
the reporting threshold of 100 kg/y ear. Manufacture and import quantities for the 
remaining 15 phthalates w ere in the range of 10 000 to 1 000 000 kg/y ear. Phthalates  
are used in a variety of consumer, commercial and industrial products in Canada, 
including plastics, paints and coatings, adhesives and sealants, automotive parts, 
electronics, and personal care products.  
Water is expected to be the primary receiving medium for phthalates, although some 
release into air may also occur. When released into t he environment, short -chain 
phthalates are predicted to distribute into water, air and soil, while long -chain phthalates 
will distribute mainly into soil and sediment with lesser proportions present in the water 
column. Substances in the medium -chain subgr oup exhibit a range of physical -chemical  
v properties ; therefore the predicted distribution  among environmental media varies  
across the substances .  
Phthalates biodegrade and are not expected to persist in the environment , although 
degradation rates vary with phthalate molecular size and physicochemical properties, 
substrate concentration and environmental conditions . Degradation proceeds more 
slowly under low oxygen conditions, such as may occur in sediment and soil, potentially 
increasing exposure times for organisms residing in these media. As well, information 
on Canadian phthalate use and release patterns suggests that exposure to phthalates 
in the Canadian environment may be continuous. Because of  their rapid biodegradation, 
exposure to phthalates wil l be greatest for organisms inhabiting areas close to release 
sites.  
In the environment, phthalates are bioavailable but do not have high bioaccumulation 
and biomagnification potential given a high rate of biotransformation in biota. Most l ong-
chain phthal ates demonstrate low hazard potential in aquatic and terrestrial species , 
while short - and medium -chain phthalates exhibit moderate to high hazard potential . 
While narcosis is an important mode of toxic action for phthalates, particularly under 
short -term exposure, there is strong evidence that some phthalates may also elicit 
longer -term chronic adverse  effects through other , specific  modes of action. In 
particular, some phthalates may have the ability to affect the normal functioning of 
endocrine systems i n organisms. While  strong  in vivo  evidence of effects on endocrine 
systems  in aquatic organisms has only been demonstrated for a small number of 
medium -chain phthalates, evidence suggests that many medium -chain phthalates and 
some short -chain and long -chain phthalates possess properties that could allow them to 
adversely influence endocrine activity under some conditions.  
Results from an analysis of risk quotients comparing estimated potential exposures for 
individual phthalates (predicted environmental concentration  [PEC]) with their potential 
for adverse effects  (predicted no -effect concentration [PNEC ]) determined that all 14 
phthalates  in the Phthalate Substance Grouping  present a low risk of causing adverse 
effects to aquatic species given current ex posure levels in the Canadian environment. 
One additional  phthalate, DEHP, ha s the potential to cause adverse effects in 
populations of aquatic organisms in Canada at current exposure levels.  
In addition, t issue residue analyses were conducted  for phthala tes having  dietary 
uptake  as the primary exposure pathway . The results indicated that maximum tissue 
concentrations based on solubility limits will be lower than levels associated with 
adverse acute or chronic lethality effects due to narcosis. A cumulativ e risk analysis 
using the Sum of Internal Toxic Units (ITUs) approach determined a highest total ITU 
value of  0.2. This value was considered to be conservative as it assumed maximum 
internal tissue concentrations and highest predicted exposure levels for each of the 28 
phthalates examined in the assessment . The results indicate there is  no ecological 
concern due to c umulative effects based on lethality and a narcotic mode of action.   
vi For the general population in Canada, exposure estimates derived from biomonitoring 
data, when available, were compared to environmental media and food exposure 
estimates. The principal so urce of exposure to DMP is expected to be breast milk and 
food, with indoor air and dust also acting as contributors. Dermal and inhalation 
(aerosol) exposure to personal care products were also evaluated for adults and infants. 
Sources of exposure for med ium-chain phthalates are indoor air, dust, food and breast 
milk. Given the information received indicating that a portion of these substances in 
manufactured items may come in contact with skin, exposure scenarios were identified 
to characterize dermal exp osure for adults and infants. Finally, DIBP and DINP may 
also be present in children’s toys and articles; therefore, oral exposure from mouthing 
these products was also evaluated. The principal source of exposure to DIDP and DUP 
for the general population is expected to be house dust (oral ingestion) as well as food 
and beverages for DIDP (oral ingestion). Exposure scenarios were identified to 
characterize dermal exposure for adults and children for both long -chain phthalates.   
 
With regard to human health , the health effects data for medium -chain phthalates show 
that there is evidence of effects in animal studies that include s developmental, 
reproductive and systemic effects related to the liver and kidneys. Of these, depending 
on the phthalate in question , the critical effect for risk characterization is developmental 
effects on males, as the available evidence is strongest for effects on the development 
of the reproductive system, such as indications of feminization in males, reproductive 
tract malformati ons, and effects on fertility related to a relatively well -studied mode of 
action called the “rat phthalate syndrome” (RPS). This syndrome has been associated 
with the lowest levels of exposure to this subgroup examined to date in animal studies. 
The healt h effects database for short -chain and long -chain phthalate esters shows no 
evidence of adverse effects on the development of the reproductive system in males. 
The critical levels selected for risk characterization for DMP were mainly related to mild 
chang es in brain weights after chronic dermal exposure. The health effects database for 
long-chain phthalates shows that the critical effect for risk characterization is effects on 
the liver.  
 
Comparisons of estimates of exposure to the 10 medium -chain phthala tes in the 
Phthalate Substance Grouping from various sources, such as environmental media, 
food, contact with plastic articles (PVC, polyurethane, polyester, etc.), toys and/or 
personal care products , as well as biomonitoring levels (if available) for all age groups 
with the appropriate critical effect levels, result in margins of exposure (MOEs) that are 
considered adequate to address uncertainties in the exposure and health effects 
databases. Further , these margins are also considered protective of potential 
reproductive effects not only in males exposed at older life stages but also in females, in 
addition to effects in other organ systems. Comparisons of estimates of exposure to 
DMP from environment al media, food, and personal care products, as well as 
biomonitoring levels for all age groups, with the appropriate critical effect levels, result in 
MOEs that are considered adequate to address uncertainties in the exposure and 
health effects databases. Comparisons of estimates for exposure to DIDP and DUP 
from various sources such as environmental media, food and contact with plastic 
articles as well as from biomonitoring levels, as available, with critical effect levels  
vii results in margins that are consi dered adequate to address uncertainties in the 
exposure and health effects databases . Those margins are also  protective of potential 
limited developmental and reproductive effects of DIDP and DUP toxicity not only in 
males, but also in females as well as o ther systemic effects.  
 
Results of the CEPA section 71 industry survey indicate that CHIBP, BCHP and BIOP 
are not currently in use above the reporting threshold of 100 kg, and the likelihood of 
exposure to the general population in Canada is considered to  be low. Hence, the 
potential risk to human health is considered to be low for these three substances.  
On the basis of the information available, there is evidence that phthalates in the 
medium -chain subgroup have a common mode of action, as they elicit e ffects on the 
developing male reproductive system indicative of RPS. Although the MOEs associated 
with the original 10 medium -chain phthalates included in this assessment are currently 
considered adequate on an individual substance basis, these MOEs do not  address 
potential risk from concurrent exposure to these and other similar phthalates.  As 
mentioned above , an additional 5 phthalates (BBP, DBP, DEHP, DnHP, and DIOP) 
were considered in the evaluation of cumulative risk for human health given information 
indicating that their mode of action is likely to be similar to that of phthalates in the 
medium -chain subgroup , as well as evidence that they may represent a potential for 
exposure to the general population of Canada.  
A CRA , using a conservative, lower -tiered hazard index (HI) approach has been 
conducted and indicates no concern for potential cumulative risk of medium -chain 
phthalates for the general Canadian population, specifically the more sensitive 
subpopulations (pregnant women/women of childbearing a ge, infants, and children) at 
current exposure levels. The HI values for the three subpopulations with the highest 
estimated exposure levels are all below 1. Hence, further refinement to a higher -tiered 
assessment is not necessary at this time.  
Overall Conclusion  
Considering all available lines of evidence presented in this screening assessment, 
there is low risk of harm to the environment from the 14 phthalates in the Phthalate 
Substance Grouping  (DMP, DIBP, CHIBP, BCHP, DCHP, DBzP, B79P, DMCHP, 
DIHepP,  BIOP, B84P, DINP, DIDP and DUP) ; however, there is risk of harm to the 
environment from one additional phthalate, DEHP . DEHP was previously assessed by 
Environment Canada and Health Canada in 1994 under the Priority Substances 
Assessment Program. The asse ssment concluded that DEHP is harmful to human 
health in Canada. However, a conclusion for potential harm to the environment could 
not be determined at that time because of insufficient information.  
It is conclude d that the 14 substance s in the Phthalate Substance Grouping do not meet 
the criteria under paragraphs 64( a) or ( b) of CEPA as they are not entering the 
environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an 
immediate or long -term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity or  
viii that constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends . It is 
conclude d that DEHP  meet s the criteria under paragraph 64( a) of CEPA as it is entering 
or may enter the environment in a quantity or c oncentration or under conditions that 
have or may have an immediate or long -term harmful effect on the environment or its 
biological diversity. However, it is conclude d that DEHP does not meet the criteria under 
paragraph 64( b) of CEPA as it is not entering the environment in a quantity or 
concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger to the 
environment on which life depends.  
On the basis of the information presented in this screening assessment, i t is conclude d 
that all 14 phthalates in the Phthalate Substance Grouping do not meet the criteria 
under paragraph 64 (c) of CEPA as they  are not entering the environment in a quantity 
or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in 
Canada  to human life or health.  Also, the previous conclusion made in the 1994 PSL 
assessment of DEHP, that it meets the criteria under paragraph 64(c) of CEPA, remains 
valid.  
Therefore, it is conclude d that DEHP meet s one or more of the criteria set out in sect ion 
64 of CEPA. DEHP has been determined to not meet the persistence or 
bioaccumulation criteria as set out in the Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations  
of CEPA.

 Introduction  
Pursuant to sections 68 and 74 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 
(CEPA) (Canada 1999), the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health have 
conducted a screening assessment of 14 phthalate esters ( phthalates ), referred to  
collectively as the Phthalate Substance Grouping , to determine whether these 
substances present or may present a risk to the environment or to human health .  
These substances  are part of the Substance Groupings Initiative , a key element  of the 
Government of Canada’s Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) . The substances in this 
grouping were identified as priorities for assessment as  they met categorization criteria 
under subsection 73 (1) of CEPA or were considered a priority on the basis of other  
human health concerns ( ECCC, HC [modified 2007 ]). Certain substances within this 
substance grouping have been identified by other jurisdictions as a concern due to  their 
poten tial reproductive and developmental effects in humans.  
Some phthalates may have common health or ecological effects of concern, so the 
potential for cumulative risk from combined exposure to these substances was 
addressed by considering an additional 14 phthalates. The additional phthalates did not 
meet categorization criteria and were therefore not identified as priorities for 
assessment. However, they were selected for inclusion in the evaluation of cumulative 
risk on the basis of information indicating that their mode of action is likely to be similar 
to that of phthalates in the grouping, as well as evidence that they may represent a 
potential for exposure to the general population of Canada and to the Canadian 
environment. Four of the  additional phthalates (DBP, BBP, DEHP and DnOP) were 
previously assessed, on an individual basis, in the First or Second Priority Substances 
Lists (PSL1 and PSL2) (Environment Canada and Health Canada 1993, 1994a,b, 
2000).  DBP and BBP were determined to n ot present a risk to the environment or to 
human health. DnOP was found to not present a risk to the environment ; however , at 
the time of the assessment, the available information was not sufficient to allow a 
conclusion in terms of human health. A subsequ ent report published by Health Canada 
in 2003 concluded that DnOP did not pose a risk to human health. DEHP was 
determined to present a risk to human health in Canada; however, there was insufficient 
information to conclude on the potential for risk to the  environment  at that time .  
This screening assessment includes consider ation of  information on chemical 
properties, environmental fate, hazards, uses and exposure, including additional 
information submitted by stakeholders. Relevant data were identified up  to August  2018 
for the ecological portion and up to January  2018 for the health portion of this screening 
assessment . Empirical data from key studies, as well as  some results from models, 
were used to reach conclusions. When available and relevant, information presented in 
assessments from other jurisdictions was considered.  
This screening assessment follows  the August 2015 publication of  four state  of the 
scienc e (SOS) reports (Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d) for the 14 
substances in the Phthalate Substance Grouping, and of a document entitled Proposed  
2 Approach for Cumulative Risk Assessment of Certain Phthalates under the Chemicals 
Management Plan  (Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 e). These documents 
were released ahead of the screening assessment in order to allow for the receipt of 
comments and suggestions from interested parties relating to the proposed CRA  
approach. Comments received durin g the  60-day public comment period were taken 
into consideration during the preparation of th is screening assessment. The screening 
assessment summarizes the information presented in the four SOS reports and 
incorporates relevant new information. As well, the assessment presents risk 
characterization s for phthalates in the grouping, including analysis of the potential for 
cumulative risk  (ecological risk and risk to human health) , and provides conclusion s 
under section 64 of CEPA.  
This screening assessment was prepared by staff in the CEPA Risk Assessment 
Program at Health Canada  and Environment and Climate Change Canada and 
incorporates input from other programs within these departments. The ecological and 
human health portions of this assessment have undergone external review and/or 
consultation. Comments on the technical portions relevant to the environment were 
received from Dr. Thomas Backhaus (Faust & Backhaus Environmental Co., Germany), 
Sonja Bissegger (Royal Military College  of Canada), Dr. Valerie Langlois (Royal Military 
College of Canada), Dr. Lynn McCarty (L.S. McCarty Scientific Research & Consulting, 
Canada), and Patricia Schmieder (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) . Comments 
on the technical portions relevant to hu man health were received from  Linda Teuschler 
(Private consultant – retired from US EPA), Donna Vorhees (The Science 
Collaborative), Bernard Gadagbui (Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment), and Dr. 
Raymond York (RG York & Associates) . Additionally, th e draft of this screening 
assessment was subject to a 60 -day public comment period. While external comments 
were taken into consideration, the final content and outcome of the screening 
assessment remain the responsibility of Health Canada and Environment and Climate 
Change Canada.  
This screening assessment focuses on information critical to determining whether 
substances meet the criteria as set out in section 64 of CEPA by examining scientific 
information and incorporating a weight of evidence approach an d precaution2. This 
screening assessment presents th e critical information and considerations on which  the 
conclusions are based . Additional details are provided in the SOS reports and  the CRA 
document referred to above.  
                                            
2 A determination of whether one or more of the criteria of section 64 of CEPA are met is based upo n an assessment 
of potential risks to the environment and/or to human health associated with exposures in the general environment. 
For humans, this includes, but is not limited to, exposures from ambient and indoor air, drinking water, foodstuffs , and 
products available to consumers . A conclusion under CEPA is not relevant to, nor does it preclude, an assessment 
against the hazard criteria specified in the Hazardous Products Regulations , which are part of the regulatory 
framework for the Workplace Hazardous  Materials Information System for products intended for workplace use. 
Similarly, a conclusion based on the criteria contained in section 64 of CEPA does not preclude actions being 
undertaken under other sections of CEPA or other Acts .

 Identity of substances  
The phthalate esters (phthalates) examined in this screening assessment are listed in 
Table  2-1. Structurally, these  phthalates are comprised of a benzene ring with two ester 
side groups in the ortho  position.  
Substances in the Phthalate Substance Grouping we re divided into short -chain, 
medium -chain and long -chain subgroups, depending on the length of the carbon 
backbone (i.e., the longest straight chain of carbons) in their ester side -groups. Short -
chain phthalates are those with a carbon backbone length of 1  or 2, medium -chain 
phthalates have a backbone length of 3 to 7 carbons and long -chain phthalates have a 
backbone length of 8 carbons or greater. The nature of the ester side -groups, which can 
be linear, branched or cyclic, determines both the identity of the particular phthalate and 
its physical and toxicological properties.  
The primary basis for the subgroups from a health hazard perspective was a structure 
activity relationship (SAR) analysis using studies related to important events in the 
mode of acti on for phthalate -induced androgen insufficiency during male reproductive 
development in the rat. The effects of phthalate esters for these important events 
appear to be structure -dependent and highly related to the length and nature of their 
alkyl chain. F rom an ecological perspective, subgrouping was based primarily on 
differences in log K ow and water solubility and their resulting effects on bioaccumulation 
and ecotoxicity. For the purposes of the health review, DINP was included with the 
medium -chain pht halates subgroup , while for the purposes of the ecological review , it 
was considered to align more closely with the long -chain phthalate subgroup.  
The chemical structure, molecular weight s, water solubilit ies and octanol -water partition 
coefficients (log K ow) for phthalates in the Phthalate Substance Grouping are listed in 
Appendix  A. Additional information is provided in Environment Canada , Health Canada 
(2015a ,b,c,d, e), and Environment and Climate Change Canada ( ECCC 2018). New 
compositional information on the UVCB phthalate, 1,2 -benzenedicarboxylic acid, benzyl 
C7-9-branched and linear alkyl esters (B79P, CAS RN 68515 -40-2) was received during 
the 60 -day public comment period for the draft screening assessment and  this led to a 
review of all aspects rela ting to the physical -chemical properties, fate, toxicity and 
environmental occurrence of this substance. Changes resulting from this review are 
highlighted in the relevant sections of the screening assessment.  
In some cases, a read -across approach using da ta from analogues and the results of 
quantitative structure -activity relationship (QSAR) models were used to inform the 
ecological and human health assessments. Model results and descriptions of methods 
used for analogue selection are provided in Environme nt Canada , Health Canada 
(2015 a,b,c,d).

 Physical and chemical properties  
The chemical properties of substances in the Phthalate Substance Grouping are 
primarily determined by th e molar volume of the substance and the length of the alkyl 
side-chains substituted on the diester groups (Cousins et al. 2003). Substances in the 
grouping are oily liquids at typical ambient temperatures. Melting points for substances 
in the grouping vary between -64°C and 66°C, and boiling points are between 205°C 
and 463°C. Therefore, some phthalates in the grouping have the potential to be present 
in the solid state at low temperatures in the environment. In general, water solubility and 
vapour pressure  decrease with increasing molar volume and alkyl side -chain length, 
while the tendency to adsorb to organic materials and particulates increases. For 
example , the short -chain phthalate DMP has very high water solubility (4000 mg/L), 
moderate vapour pressur e (0.4 Pa) and low partition coefficients (log K ow 1.6, log K oc 
between 1.9 and 2.5), while the long -chain phthalate DIDP has very low water solubility 
and vapour pressure (1.7 × 10-4 mg/L, 6.7 × 10-5 Pa) and high to very high partition 
coefficients (log K ow > 8, log K oc 5.5). Medium -chain phthalates display a  range of 
chemical property values intermediate between those of short - and long -chain 
phthalates. Detailed information about chemical property values for substances in the 
Phthalate Substance Grouping  is provided in the SOS reports (Environment Canada , 
Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d).  
Chemical property data used for B79P were reviewed following the receipt of new 
compositional  information for this UVCB phthalate  submitted during the 60 -day public 
comment p eriod for the draft screening assessment . As experimental data were not 
available, (Q)SAR models were used to generate data for boiling point, water solubility, 
vapour pressure, Henry’s Law constant, and partition coefficients . Physical -chemical 
property v alues selected for B79P , as well as further information on the derivation of 
these values,  are presented in Table A -2 of Appendix A.  
 
 Sources  
Anthropogenic activities are the major source of phthalates in the environment. An 
industry survey issued pursuant to section 71 of CEPA was conducted in 2013 to obtain 
information on quantities in commerce in 2012 for substances in the Phthalate 
Substance Grouping and for the additional phthalates in Canada (Canada 2013). 
Results are  presented in Tables 4 -1 and 4 -2 (Environment Canada 2014). Because of 
the targeted nature of the survey, reported use quantities may not fully reflect all uses in 
Canada.

 Releases to the environment  
There are no known major natural sources of phthalates , and releases to the 
environment are associated with anthropogenic  activities . Releases ma y occur during 
the manufacture and processing of phthalates, including transportation and storage, as 
well as during production, use and disposal of products that contain phthalates (e.g., 
release of phthalates into wastewater system s from use of cosmetics ). Phthalates 
present in products and manufactured items may be released to the environment as the 
product or item is degraded by weathering forces such as sunlight and rainfall. 
Phthalates are not chemically bound to polymer matrices during processing act ivities 
and can migrate to the surface of polymer products over time. The rate of this migration 
is expected to be slow and will be counteracted by chemical and physical attractive 
forces that work to hold the phthalates within polymers. Given their consum er and 
industrial applications, releases of phthalates to the environment are expected to occur 
primarily to air and to water.  
Information on releases of phthalates in Canada  is limited . Six phthalates (DMP and five 
of the additional phthalates , i.e., DEP,  DBP, BBP, DEHP and DnOP ) are reportable to 
the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), where all reported releases were to air  
(NPRI 2010 -2014 ). For the section 71 survey, many submissions indicate d no or 
unknown releases  (Environment Canada 2014) .  
Further discussion on the potential for environmental release is provided in Environment 
Canada , Health Canada (2015 a,b,c,d).   
10 
 Environmental fate and behaviour  
 Environmental distribution  
The EQC Level III fugacity model (New EQC 2011) was used to predict the 
environmental mass -fraction distributions of the short -, medium -, and long -chain 
phthalates. Environmental distribution trends were largely driven by the phthalates ’ 
capacity to solubilize in water, volatilize or adsorb to particles, where smaller more  
soluble substances tended to be associated with the air and aquatic media, and larger 
substances with limited water solubility tended to adsorb to sediment or remain in soil. 
The EQC model results show that the short -chain phthalates distribute into water , soil 
and air, but not into sediment, the medium -chain phthalates distribute more evenly 
between water and sediment, and the long -chain phthalates distribute mainly into 
sediment, with a lesser proportion remaining in water. Soil was predicted to be an 
important receiving compartment for the medium - and long -chain phthalates  (that is, if 
released to air or soil, the medium - and long -chain phthalates primarily remain in soil ). 
The results from the Level III fugacity modelling showing percent distribution in to water, 
soil and sediment based on simulated release into each compartment are summarized 
in ECCC (201 8).  
On the basis of the known uses and releases of phthalates (see Sections 5 and 6), 
water is considered to be the key receiving environmental compart ment of phthalates.  
 Environmental persistence  
The degradation of phthalates is well -characterized, and phthalates are known to be 
degraded by abiotic and biotic processes. Numerous studies have been conducted for 
the short -chain phthalates DMP and DEP, th e medium -chain phthalates DIBP, DCHP, 
BBP, DBP and DEHP, and the long -chain phthalates DIDP, DUP and DINP. Many of 
these studies have been used to characterize the less -studied phthalates, including the 
medium -chain phthalates BCHP, CHIBP, DBzP, B79P, DMCH P, BIOP, B84P, 79P, 
DIOP, DnHP, DPrP and DIHepP, and the long -chain phthalates 610P, D911P, D911P -
2, DTDP, DIUP and DnOP. Summaries of degradation studies and QSAR modelling are 
available in the SOS reports (Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d) and in 
ECCC (201 8).  
Abiotically, phthalates undergo hydrolysis, which tends to be slow, and relatively fast 
photolysis (Peterson and Staples 2003). It is biodegradation —particularly in aerobic 
conditions, by micro -organisms, including the green microalgae species ( Chang et al. 
2005; Yan and Pan 2004; Yan et al. 2002), phytoplankton ( Li et al. 2007 ) and fungi 
(Ganji et al. 1995; Sivamurthy et al. 1991; Engelhardt et al. 1977; Kim and Lee 2005; 
Lee et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2002 a, 2003, 2007) —that contributes m ost to the breakdown 
of these substances in the environment. The observed biodegradation rates vary and 
are influenced by the molecular size and physicochemical properties of phthalates, 
substrate concentration and environmental conditions. The (Q)SAR mode l-generated 
data are in agreement with the experimental data. The biodegradation of phthalate  
11 esters releases monoalkyl phthalate esters (MPEs) into the environment (McConnell 
2007). Most studies suggest that biodegradation rates of MPEs may proceed faster  than 
those of the corresponding diester parent  phthalate s (Peterson and Staples 2003). 
MPEs  were shown to be quickly degraded in natural sediments (Otton et al. 2008).  
Studies have demonstrated that phthalates with shorter side -chains can be readily 
biode graded and mineralized, whereas phthalates with longer side -chains tend to be 
somewhat less biodegradable (Wang et al. 2000; Chang et al. 2004 ; Zeng et al. 2004; 
Lertsirisopon et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2008). The differences in biodegradability among 
phtha lates are attributed to the steric effects of the side -chains, where binding of 
hydrolytic enzymes can become hindered, resulting in limited hydrolysis. Differences in 
phthalate isomers can also influence rates of degradation, as phthalate -hydrolyzing 
enzy mes are structurally specific (Liang et al. 2008).  
The short -chain phthalate DMP has a long modelled half -life in air. Its measured 
concentrations in biota in Hudson’s Bay and in air and water of the Norwegian Arctic 
indicate that it has some potential fo r long -range transport (Morin 2003). Medium - and 
long-chain phthalates are not persistent in air , and m odelling results suggest that t hey 
are unlikely to have the potential for long -range transport ( see Environment Canada , 
Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d), altho ugh DEHP, DBP, DIBP, DnBP, and DINP and the 
short -chain phthalate DEP can be associated with fine particles in areas close to 
emission sources (Ma et al. 2014; Ruzicková  et al. 2016). DIBP was also found in biota 
in the Arctic (Morin 2003). Fine particle t ransport is considered a plausible explanation 
for the observed presence of DMP and DIBP in remote areas.  
Phthalates have been detected in fresh  water worldwide and tend to adsorb to 
sediments (Chang et al. 2005). In surface water, most phthalates are readily 
biodegradable (Furtmann 1994). In sediments, both aerobic and anaerobic 
microorganisms can degrade phthalates (Hashizume et al. 2002; Chang et al. 2004; 
Kim et al. 2008) . However, despite their inherent biodegradability, phthalates can exhibit 
long half-lives in sediments because of the high degree of sorption driven by their 
hydrophobicity (Kickham et al. 2012). In aerobic biodegradation studies  conducted  
according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) 
guidelines and where wastewater treatment system  sludge is used as substrate, 
phthalates were found to be both inherently and readily biodegradable (Environment 
Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d). The apparent variability in test results can be 
attributed to the differenc es in experimental protocols, concentrations of the test 
substance, and the substrate.  
In soil, t he patterns for biodegradation rates are generally very similar to those in water 
(Peterson and Staples 2003). Environmental conditions, such as temperature, soil 
moisture and oxygen levels, as well as initial substance concentrations and soil type, all 
have an impact on the biodegradation rate (Peterson and Staples 2003; Madsen et al. 
1999; S cheunert et al. 1987). For example, half -lives for DEHP in different types of soil 
ranged from 2  days in loam soil to 69.3 days in sand (Rüdel et al. 1993; Shanker et al.  
12 1985; Roslev et al. 1998; Peterson and Staples 2003) and were up to 77 days in 
bioremediated soil from an industrial site in Brazil (Ferreira and Morita 2 012).  
 Potential f or bioaccumulation  
Bioaccumulation data for the substances in the Phthalate Substance Grouping and 
certain additional phthalates that were used for read -across (i.e., BBP and DEHP) are 
provided in the SOS reports (Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d). 
Bioaccumulation data for other additional phthalates or obtained after the SOS reports 
were published are in agreement with the data presented in the SOS reports and are 
summarized in ECCC (2018). 
Phthalates are bioavailable in the environment and certain phthalates have been 
measured in biota. The experimental and modelled bioac cumulation data and 
measurements of phthalate metabolites in aquatic organisms suggest that phthalates 
are effectively metabolized and thus do not tend t o significantly bioaccumulate. 
Measured bioconcentration factors ( BCFs ) and bioaccumulation factors ( BAFs ) for 
aquatic species range from as low as 1 to over 3000 L/kg, with the majority of the 
reported values below 1000 L/kg. Biotransformation rates were found to be in the range 
of less than 1 to 3.5  day-1. Data for sediment - and soil -dwelling organisms were also 
available for some phthalates and indicated that bioaccumulation in these media is not 
significant . Field studies confirm that phthalates do not biomagnify in the food chain  
(summarized in Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d).   
 
 Potential to cause ecological harm 
 Ecological effects assessment  
Detailed summaries of the available effects studies for substances in the Phthalate 
Substance Grouping and for a number of additional phthalates and the related critical 
body residue calculations are presented in the SOS reports (Environment Canada , 
Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d). Results of additional studies, including data from newly 
available  studies for both Grouping substances and additional phthalates , are tabulated 
in ECCC (201 8). Results from toxicity studies on rodents considered as surrogates for 
piscivorous mammals , such as mink and otters, are presented in Health Canada (2015) 
and in the Human Health Effects section of this screening assessment. An analysis of 
the overall ecological effects dataset for phthalates, observations related to their modes 
of action , and key ecological effects are summarized below. Emphas is is placed on 
aquatic organisms, given that water is considered to be the key receiving environmental 
compartment of phthalates.  Data on both freshwater and marine organisms are 
considered collectively, with no distinction made between them, as there is no evidence 
to indicate that one or the other would have greater sensitivity to phthalates.   
13 At acute exposure levels, phthalates have been shown to act through diester toxicity, 
which is a non -specific mode of action similar to baseline (non -polar) narcos is and polar 
narcosis , but resulting in slightly higher toxicity  (Veith and Broderius 1987; Veith and 
Broderius 1990; Adams et al. 1995). The body of data indicates  that under longer -term 
exposures many phthalates also act through specific modes of action (MoAs). These 
MoAs are well documented in mammalian studies for the medium -chain phthalates, 
notably androgen -dependent effects affecting development of the male reproductive 
tract (reviewed in Health Canada 2015). In aquatic organisms, studies with exposu res to 
phthalates of lower chain lengths, i.e., the short - and a number of medium -chain 
phthalates, show an array of apical and non -apical effects. Non -apical effects have 
been linked to estrogen and thyroid -mediated cellular pathways; however, the 
androge n-dependent responses have not been extensively studied in non -mammalian 
organisms. Other n on-apical responses  for critical cellular pathways  implicated in 
normal growth, development  and reproduction, such as those associated with 
antioxidant and cellular stress response, energy metabolism, and cellular detoxification 
mechanisms have been identified for certain short - and medium -chain phthalates , as 
well as the long -chain phthalate s DINP, DIDP and  DnOP  (see section 8.1.1 and ECCC 
2018 ). It is n oted that for certain well -studied phthalates (e.g., BBP, DBP, DEHP) there 
is often variability or inconsistency among studies and model results in the observed 
effects or responses, such as changes in vitellogenin (VTG) levels or model estimates 
of recept or binding affinities. While this is likely due to factors such as the species and 
life stage considered , as well as differences in test design and study conditions , it 
makes it a challenge to elucidate the precise MoA(s) underlying the observed effects.  
8.1.1  Toxicity to aquatic organisms  
Water solubility and log K ow are important parameters that affect bioavailability of a 
substance in environmental media, thereby influencing its toxicity. Substances with very 
low water solubilities are likely to be less bioavailable in the environment through direct 
water uptake, wi th more likely exposure through the diet. For example, a decreasing 
trend in toxicity was reported for the phthalates DMP, DEP, DBP, BBP, DnOP and DIOP 
in acute toxicity testing with the bacterium, Vibrio qinghaiensis sp. -Q67 (Ding et al. 
2017). The resear chers correlated the observed decrease in toxicity with increased 
hydrophobicity (log K ow) and hypothesized that in addition to greater hydrophobicity, the 
larger molecular volume associated with increasing alkyl side chain length may also 
contribute to de creasing acute toxicity due to reduced uptake potential across cell 
membranes. Log K ow can be an important parameter in predicting acute toxicity for 
many MoAs, e.g., non -polar narcosis, polar narcosis, ester narcosis, but not for others 
characterized by r eactive mechanisms, including electrophile MoAs.  
Interestingly, log Kow was also observed to correlate with a receptor -based MoA, i.e., 
estrogen receptor (ER) binding affinity. For a series of industrial chemicals including 
phthalates , the binding affinity to rainbow trout ER was found to increase linearly with 
log K ow value s in the range of 1.6 to 4.6 (DMP to DBP and BBP) and to remain nearly 
constant at greater lipophilicity, as seen for DnHP with a log  Kow of 6.6 (Hornung et al. 
2014 ). Phthalates with higher log K ow (e.g., DEHP, DnOP) did not bind to the ER. For  
14 long-chain phthalates, which are characterized by very low water solubilities and high 
log K ow value s, diester toxicity seems to be the prevalent acute mode of action. It has 
been suggested that phthalates with alkyl chains of six or more carbons may be less 
likely to  cause intrinsic toxicity to aquatic organisms as the ir rapid metabolism and low 
water solubility prevent the critical toxicity body burden from being reached (Bra dlee 
and Thomas 2003). Indeed, for many of the phthalates with carbon backbones of 8 or 
more carbons, acute effects have only rarely been reported  below solubility limits , and 
the calculated tissue residues were low, not exceeding thresholds for lethal effects (see 
Table 8 -3). However, high toxicities have been noted for the poorly soluble medium -
chain phthalates with backbones of 6 or 7 carbons, e.g., DEHP  (summarized in 
Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 b; ECCC 201 8).  
An analysis of the available effects data for aquatic organisms was conducted for each 
phthalate. A simplified schematic is presented in Table 8 -1, where data availability is 
noted for each substance fro m in vivo  standard testing and studies characterizing 
effects linked to estrogen -, androgen -, and the thyroid -mediated pathways either in vivo  
or in vitro . In silico  tools, including ER Expert System (ERES) (version 3) [Schmieder et 
al. 2014; personal comm unication, external peer review by US EPA, Office of Research 
and Development, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory 
Mid-Continent Ecology Division, April 2016  (ERES binding predictions 4 -20-16 Excel 
spreadsheet) , unreferenced ] and TIMES (2014) have also been used to identify 
receptor binding potential of phthalates. In silico -determined binding potential of 
phthalates is presented in Table 8 -2 for rainbow trout ER (from ERES version 3) and 
rodent ER (including both parent compo unds and their metabolites) and androgen (AR) 
receptor (TIMES 2014). According to the TIMES (2014) model, metabolites of certain 
long-chain phthalates showed affinity for the ER, while their parent compounds were 
predicted to have no binding affinity for t he ER.  
Large data gaps were found in ecological effects information for phthalates, even 
though certain phthalates, such as DEHP, BBP and DBP , have been relatively well 
studied. Of particular importance is the lack of studies characterizing the relative 
potency of phthalates across the subgroups. The few studies that look at effects in the 
same biological system include only a small subset of phthalates, and since different 
endpoints are characterized, a direct comparison is not possible. Mankidy et al. (20 13) 
observed that DEHP was more potent than BBP, on the basis of potency as an agonist 
of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), whereas Zhou et al. (2011 a) established a 
potency order of DBP>DEP>DMP>DnOP>DEHP based on abalone metamorphosis.   
Gardner et al. (2016) reported enhanced toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length for 
developing frog embryos exposed to three shorter chain phthalates, with DBP (four 
carbons in alkyl chain) exhibiting greater toxicity than DPrP (three carbons in alkyl 
chain), and DEP  (two carbons in alkyl chain) being the least toxic. Teratogenic risk did 
not change markedly with alkyl chain length, with only DBP determined to be 
teratogenic at the concentrations tested (Gardner et al. 2016). A similar trend with alkyl 
chain length wa s observed for growth inhibition in the dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis. 
Phthalates with alkyl side chains containing less than six carbons significantly inhibited 
growth in the algae, with toxicity increasing with increasing side chain length, i.e. for  
15 toxicity, BBP>DIBP>DBP>DEP (Liu et al. 2016a). Phthalates with side chains 
containing more than six carbons (DEHP, DINP, DIDP) did not inhibit algal cell growth, 
an effect attributed to their low water solubility. As well, DMP showed no adverse 
effects, possi bly due to algal degradation of DMP (Yan et al. 1995; Liu et al. 2016a).  
Another limitation found in many studies is the tendency to conduct them at exposure 
concentrations that are high or that exceed water solubility limits, which makes 
interpretation of  results complicated and the results of lesser  relevance to environmental 
conditions. It is noted that in the few in vivo  studies performed at very low exposure 
concentrations (in the range of 10-4 to 10-3 mg/L), such as those for DEHP (Oehlmann et 
al. 200 9; Carnevali et al. 2010; Corradetti et al. 2013 ; Kinch et al. 2016 ), deleterious 
effects continue to be observed. The key data gap is the lack of aquatic effects studies 
for phthalates conducted at environmentally relevant exposure concentrations and 
within solubility limits, which characterize modes of action, particularly related to the 
androgen -mediated pathways, and that could be linked to population -level effects.

Below is a brief summary of some of the available effects data for the short -, medium -, 
and long -chain phthalates that describes both standard studies and those describing 
specific MoAs. It is meant to highlight effect levels across phthalate subgroups, as  
observed based on standard and non -standard testi ng. Available ecological effects 
information has been previously summarized in detail in Environment Canada, Health 
Canada (2015a,b,c,d), and additional and newly published studies are noted in ECCC  
(2018).  
Standard toxicity testing  indicates that , in gene ral, the soluble short -chain phthalates 
have low acute and chronic toxicity to fish, invertebrates, and algae , likely due to factors 
such as low hydrophobicity, high degradability and metabolic potential . For DMP and 
DEP, fish acute median lethal concentra tion ( LC50) values were in the range of 10 to 
120 mg/L (summarized in ECCC 201 8). Similarly, LC 50 values and median effect ive 
concentration ( EC50) values for effects such as immobility and changes in biomass, on 
mysid shrimp, daphnids and algae were noted at exposure concentrations generally 
greater than 10 mg/L (summarized in Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 a; 
ECCC 201 8). In contrast, studies with abalone suggest that this species is particularly 
sensitive to DMP and DEP exposure, with adverse effects established through modes of 
action other than narcosis. For DMP, effects on larval settlement were noted at an 
exposure concentration of 0.05 mg/L (Yang et al. 2009), and a no observed effect 
concentration ( NOEC ) for metamorphosis was determined as 0.02 mg/L , with a 50% 
reduction in metamorphosis at 0.2 mg/L  (Liu et al. 2009). In terms of reproductive 
effects, DMP -treated a balone sperm were found to exhibit dose -dependent decreases 
in fertilization efficiency, morphogenesis and hatchability at exposure concentrations 
between 0.01 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L (Zhou et al. 2011 b). Reduced sperm ATPase activities 
and alterations to the ex pression patterns of physiologically -regulated genes such as 
cyp3a , 17β-hsd 11  and 17β-hsd 12  were also observed and were considered to have 
contributed to the observed effects on fertilization and embryogenesis (Zhou et al. 
2011b). At an exposure concentr ation of 0.2 mg/L, DEP was found to reduce 
metamorphosis rates, and at 2 mg/L it resulted in increase d abnormality rates of 
abalone embryos  and reduce d hatching rates (Zhou et al. 2011 a). Several possible  
18 toxicological mechanisms were proposed for the acti on of phthalates on the embryos, 
including affecting activity of the Na+-K+ pump and/or Ca2+-Mg2+ pump, altering the 
peroxidase level and subsequent malondialdehyde production, damaging extra -
embryonic membrane structure, as well as altering the expression  of several endocrine -
related genes ( gpx, cyp3a , and 17β-hsd 12 ). The researchers concluded that the five 
phthalates tested (DEP, DBP, DMP, DEHP and dioctyl phthalate or DOP) affected the 
embryonic ontogeny of abalone by interfering with osmoregulation, in ducing oxidative 
stress, damaging embryo envelope structure, and disrupting physiological homeostasis 
(Zhou et al. 2011a). A recent study by Mathieu -Denoncourt et al. (2016) reported 
delayed development and increased frequency of malformations in tadpoles of Western 
clawed frog exposed to lowest DMP concentrations of 0.1 mg/L, indicating that some 
early life stage amphibians may also be sensitive to short -chain phthalates exposure.  
For the medium -chain phthalates, moderate to high toxicity has been observed  in 
numerous studies with aquatic organisms (summarized in Environment Canada , Health 
Canada 2015 b; ECCC 201 8). Results indicate that those with side -chain  backbone s of 
six or fewer  carbons —i.e., DBP, BBP, DCHP  and DEHP —are highly hazardous to fish, 
invertebrates, and algae, where LC 50 and effects such as behavioral abnormalities in 
fish, reproductive effects in daphnids, and effects on biomass in algae were observed at 
an exposure concentration of less than 1 mg/L. Secondary effects linked to estroge nic, 
thyroid -, or anti -androgenic modes of action are also relatively well documented for 
these substances , although inconsistent responses have been observed for alteration of 
VTG levels in studies with BBP and DEHP. BBP was shown to displace estradiol fr om 
the hepatic estrogen receptor, to inhibit ER binding, to either alter VTG production in 
rainbow trout following intra -peritoneal injection (Christiansen et al. 2000) or to have no 
impact on VTG levels in studies with fathead minnow (Study Submission 201 4d; Harries 
et al. 2000), to impact gonadal histology (Study Submission 2014d) and to reduce 
spermatogonia of fathead minnows (EC 2009; ECHA c2007 -2015). BBP also exhibited 
a small but significant increase in the expression of mRNA of the androgen receptor  in 
developing fish embryos (Mankidy et al. 2013)  and has been linked with developmental 
toxicity and cardiac defects in zebrafish embryos (Sun and Liu 2017). A recent study 
using larval midge, Chironomus riparius , demonstrated significant downregulation o f 
genes associated with ribosome synthesis following exposure to very low 
concentrations (1 × 10-6 mg/L) of BBP, indicating potential for impairment of biogenesis 
pathways for genes essential to cell metabolism and cellular protein synthesis (Herrero 
et al. 2016) .  
Most toxicity studies for DCHP in fish, amphibians, invertebrates and algae were 
conducted at exposure concentrations that approach or exceed  the substance ’s 
reported water solubility limit of 1 mg/L (ECHA c2007 –2014b; Mathieu -Denoncourt et al. 
2016). Two Daphnia  studies, within the water solubility limit for DCHP, showed effects 
at low exposure concentrations , but only with chronic exposure (21 -day EC 50 and NOEC 
for loss of mobility at 0.68 and 0.18 mg/L, respectively) (ECHA c2007 –2014b). Mathieu -
Denoncourt et al. (2016) reported increased mortality, increased frequency of 
malformations, and significant up -regulation of cellular stress -related messenger -RNA 
(mRNA) in larval Western clawed frog, Silurana tropicalis , at a lowest exposure  
19 conc entration of 4.1 mg/L DCHP. While this concentration slightly exceeds the 1 mg/L 
solubility value, the use of solvent (DMSO) may have slightly altered the substance 
solubility such that the reported measured concentration of 4.1 mg/L can be considered 
to fall within a reasonable range of the solubility value. For DBP, 96 -hour LC 50s of less 
than 1 mg/L to 7.3 mg/L in fish were determined (Buccafusco et al. 1981; Mayer and 
Ellersieck 1986; CMA 1984; Hudson et al. 1981; Adams et al. 1995). DBP did not  
induce V TG in rainbow trout or zebrafish at concentrations up to 1 mg/L  (Van den Belt 
et al. 2003). DBP exposure concentrations in the range of 0.005 to 0.5 mg/L in different 
studies increased larval mortality and teratogenicity (Ortiz -Zarragitia et al. 2006), 
increased activity of anti -oxidant enzymes and immune -related enzymes (Xu et al. 
2013), and altered plasma 11 -ketotestosterone and spiggin levels (Aoki 2010; Aoki et al. 
2011).  
For DEHP, Carnevali et al. (2010) found a significant reduction in fecundity of f emale 
zebrafish exposed to nominal concentrations ranging from 2 × 10-5 to 0.40 mg/L. 
Corradetti et al. (2013) also found that exposure to DEHP at a concentration of 2 × 10-4 
mg/L impaired reproduction in zebrafish by inducing a number of changes, includin g 
reduced embryo production. Histological changes  in fish spermatozoa  and gonads 
(indication of intersex) and retardation of oocyte development  following exposure to 
DEHP have also been reported  (Ye et al. 201 4; Kim et al. 2002 b; Norman et al. 2007) . 
DEHP significantly altered pericardial, head and yolk morphology in embryonic 
zebrafish exposed to 0.002 mg/L from 3 to 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) (Kinch et al. 
2016). The effects were less marked in fish exposed from 3 to 48 hpf or 3 to 72 hpf, 
indicati ng a window of exposure sensitivity from 3 to 24 hpf for overall contaminant -
induced changes to morphological development and from 3 to 48 hpf for pericardial and 
head development. In addition to exposure time and life stage specificity, tissue 
specificity  was also evident in the study results. Changes to head morphology following 
DEHP exposure did not differ significantly from those of thyroid hormone, suggesting 
that the effects of DEHP on head morphology may in large part be transduced by 
interaction wit h thyroid hormone receptors (Kinch et al. 2016). Embryonic marine 
medaka exposed to 0.1 and 1 mg/L DEHP for up to 10 days post fertilization exhibited 
significant and concentration -dependent induction of two major endocrine -responsive 
genes (ER, PPAR), as well as genes associated with detoxification mechanisms in the 
body (CYP19) (Ye et al. 2016). The induction effects were attributed to bioaccumulation 
of DEHP in the fish and were no longer evident after a 12 -day depuration period in 
clean sea water. The t ime-dependent increase of DEHP burdens during embryonic 
stages and subsequent decrease of these burdens in larval stages emphasized the 
importance of metabolism in the elimination of accumulated DEHP. Metabolic ability is 
more developed in larval fish as c ompared with earlier developmental stages such as 
the embryo, thereby facilitating removal of DEHP from the body (Ye et al. 2016).  
Liu et al. (2016b) derived Predicted No -Effect Concentrations (PNECs) for DEHP in 
aquatic species using Species Sensitivity D istributions (SSDs) for endpoints of survival, 
growth and development, biochemical and molecular biology, reproduction (combined 
vertebrate and invertebrate data), fish reproduction, and invertebrate reproduction. 
Chronic PNECs based on potencies to cause lesions in the reproductive tissues of fish  
20 ranged from 0.04 to 0.20 µg/L and were significantly less than PNECs derived for other 
endpoints and taxa, such as invertebrates. The results demonstrated that reproduction 
was the most sensitive endpoint to DEHP , especially for reproductive toxicity in fish (Liu 
et al. 2016b).  
A review of ecotoxicity data for B79P was conducted following receipt of new 
compositional information for this UVCB phthalate. A 96h LC 50 of >1000 mg/L for 
rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus myki ss, is reported in the ECHA (c2007 -2018) dossier for 
B79P, as well as a 48h EC 50 of 4.5 mg/L for the water flea, Daphnia magna . However, 
clumping of the Daphnia  was observed at lower concentrations of 1.0 and 1.8 mg/L 
(ECHA c2007 -2018) and, for this reason , the results of this study are not considered 
suitable for inclusion in this screening risk assessment. The B79P ECHA dossier 
includes toxicity data for a commercial formulation of B84P (CAS RN 16883 -83-3) as 
supporting information based on a reported clo se structural similarity of this formulation 
to that of B79P (ECHA c2007 -2018). Two acute fish studies and one acute algal study 
are available for B84P, with median effect (L/EC 50) values of >1000 mg/L for all three 
studies (ECHA c2007 -2018). The combined results suggest that B79P will have low 
potential for acute adverse effects in aquatic organisms. It should be noted, however, 
that the B79P toxicity studies were conducted in 1980, while those of B84P were 
conducted in 1979. The age of the studies introdu ces uncertainty into the results, as it is 
not clear how well the formulations used in testing represent those currently in use.  
The ECOSAR model (v1.11; ECOSAR 2012) of EPI Suite (c2000 -2012), run with user -
input physical -chemical values3, predicts that B 79P will have no acute aquatic effects at 
substance saturation, supporting the empirical data provided in ECHA (c2007 -2018). 
However, modelled chronic values (ChV) of 0.003 to 0.044 mg/L, 0.007 to 0.028 mg/L 
and 0.035 to 0.066 mg/L were obtained for fish, daphni a and green algae, respectively, 
suggesting that chronic effects are possible (ECOSAR 2012).  
A 2017 ECHA decision report published after the addition of B79P to the European 
Union’s Community rolling action plan (CoRAP) list describes further eviden ce of the 
potential for chronic effects. The decision report identified several concerns associated 
with the exposure of mammalian test species to B79P, including the potential for 
developmental and reproductive effects and e vidence for possible endocrine and/or 
thyroid mediated modes of action (ECHA 2017). These concerns applied not only to 
B79P, but also to several potential metabolites of B79P that are also known to be 
metabolites of BBP (CAS RN 85 -68-7) and DINP (CAS RNs 68515 -48-0 and 28553 -12-
0), two phthalates with a recognized anti -androgenic mode of action (ECHA 2013, 
2017). The results of in silico  testing with B79P using the TIMES (2014) model are 
consistent with this and predict that both B79P and its metabolites will have binding 
affinity with r odent ER. In contrast, the model predicts that B79P will have no binding 
                                            
3 Input values used in the modelling were: melting point -50°C, boiling point 438.47 °C, water solubility 
0.25 mg/L, log K ow 6.51, vapour pressure 1.6 ×10-5 Pa, Henry’s Law constant 0.018 Pa -m3/mole and 
SMILES O=C(c1c(C(OCCCCCCC(C)C)=O)cccc1)OCc1ccccc1 .   
21 affinity with rodent AR (see Table 8 -2). No evidence of toxicity was seen in standard 
testing for the medium -chain phthalates with longer carbon backbones —i.e., DIHepP 
and B84P —or for  the long -chain phthalates up to their water solubility limits 
(Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 b,c,d; ECCC 2018 ). However, for phthalates 
DIDP and DINP, results from in vitro  laboratory testing provide preliminary indications 
that DIDP and DINP might influence normal endocrine activity in mammalian species by 
altering the production of steroid hormones in the presence of an endocrine -active 
substance (Mlynarčíková et al. 2007;  Chen et al. 2014). In a multigenerational feeding 
study with Japanese medaka, effects in hepatic microsomal testosterone metabolism 
were observed for DINP and DIDP; however, consistent adverse effects on embryo 
mortality, hatching success or survival were  not observed (Patyna et al. 2006). Similarly, 
malformation and alterations in gene expression related to androgen axis were also not 
observed in Xenopus  tadpoles following exposure to DINP (de Solla and Langlois 
2014). Cocci et al. (2017) examined the eff ects of DINP and DIDP on the expression of 
estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) using primary erythrocyte cell cultures from loggerhead 
turtle, Caretta caretta . Significant induction occurred at low (0.0001 µM) and 
intermediate (0.01 µM) test concentrations of DI DP, with the effect greatest at the 
lowest concentration and decreasing as the concentration increased. Only slight ERα 
induction occurred at the highest test concentration (1 µM), possibly indicative of 
decreased cell viability (cytotoxicity) at this conc entration. DINP exhibited a similar but 
less marked effect on ERα expression, with significant induction at the intermediate and 
high concentrations (0.01 and 1 µM) and induction highest at the intermediate 
concentration. In silico  results from the Estroge n Receptor Expert System (ERES ) 
model with trout ER (Schmieder et al. 2014; personal communication, external peer 
review by US EPA, Office of Research and Development, National Health and 
Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Mid-Continent Ecology Divi sion, April 2016; 
unreferenced) suggest no ER binding affinity for the long -chain phthalates parent 
compounds (see Table 8 -2).  
The available aquatic effects data for the medium - and long -chain phthalates with very 
low water solubilities and high log K ow values —i.e., DIHepP, B79P, DINP, D911P, 
D911 P-2, DIDP, DIUP, DTDP, DUP, B84P and DIOP —were above water solubility 
limits. It is noted that for these substances, dietary exposure is likely the more relevant 
route of uptake in the environment. Therefore, for DIHepP, B79P4, B84P, DINP, DIDP 
and DUP, tissue residues (TRs) were calculated using substance -specific 
bioaccumulation factors (BAFs), molecular weights and water solubilities. The TR 
represents the internal whole body concentration of a phthalate resulti ng from exposure 
at its limit of solubility in water, taking into account its toxicokinetics as approximated by 
the BAF. The calculated TR values for medium -chain phthalates ranged from 5.4 × 10-3 
mmol/kg (1.96 mg/kg) for DIHepP to 0.13 mmol/kg (59.1 mg/kg) for B84P and were low 
for the long -chain phthalates DINP at 2.6 × 10-4 mmol/kg (0.12 mg/kg), DIDP at 1.5 × 
                                            
4 A TR of 0.03 mmol/kg ( 10.9 mg/kg) w as calculated for B79P using a BAF value of 43.55  L/kg ( BCFBAF 
2010 ), water solubility of 0.25 mg/L and molecular weight  of 382.5 g/mol.   
22 10-5 mmol/kg (0.007 mg/kg), and DUP at 5.8 × 10-8 mmol/kg (0.000028 mg/kg). Critical 
body residues (CBR) associated with acutely lethal baseline narcosis in small aquatic 
organisms typically range from about 2 to 8 mmol/kg, while those for chronic exposures 
range from 0.2 to 0.8 mmol/kg (McCarty and Mackay 1993). The calculated internal 
conc entrations for the subset of the medium -chain and long -chain phthalates indicate 
that these phthalates are unlikely to reach levels sufficient to cause acute or chronic 
lethal effects toxicity in aquatic organisms, as the CBR thresholds are not surpassed. It 
is noted that CBR thresholds have not been developed for other modes of action 
including diester toxicity , and baseline narcosis is therefore assumed for those 
phthalates with TR calculations. It is recognized that  somewhat  lower CBR thresholds 
may be a ssociated with other MoA(s), and thus baseline narcosis MoA may 
underestimate the potential toxicity, particularly under chronic exposure. Nonetheless, 
an overlap between CBRs for narcosis and diester toxicity is expected; accordingly, the 
narcosis CBR is considered appropriate for use with phthalates.  
8.1.1.1  Predicted no -effect concentrations for the aquatic compartment  
When experimental data were not available, modelled and analogue data were used to 
select critical toxicity values for the short - and medium -chain phthalates (summarized in 
Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b). Predicted no -effect concentrations 
(PNECs) , obtained by dividing critical toxicity value s (CTV s) by the appropriate 
assessment factor s (AFs), were then calculated and ranged  from 0.00007 mg/L (DEHP) 
to 0.19 mg/L ( DIBP ). The CTVs, AF s and calculated PNECs  for each phthalate  are 
presented in Table 8 -3. When PNECs could not be derived, TR to CBR comparisons 
were made. PNECs for the additional phthalates, which are not being assessed, ranged 
from 0.003 mg/L to 0.33 mg/L and can be found in ECCC (201 8).

a Assessment factors in the range of 3 to 30 were applied to the critical toxicity values, on the basis of the duration of 
exposure period (acute or chronic), the overall robustness of the available dataset (considering factors such as the 
variety and sensitivity of tested species, quality and number of endpoints), and extrapolating to inter/intra species 
variation, short - to long -term effects , and high - to low -level effects .  
b To facilitate comparison between PNECs and the calculated TRs, units in mg/L were converted to mmol/L  (by 
dividing the substance ’s PNEC by its molecular weight).  
c This CTV is based on data for BBP; see Environment Canada , Health Canada (2015 b) for read -across rationale.  
d Carnevali et al. 2010 reported a  lower toxicity value for DEHP for reduced fecundity in zebrafish, but this was not 
used as the CTV because of the lack of appropriate statistical analysis.  
8.1.2  Toxicity to sediment -dwelling orga nisms  
Sediment toxicity data are very limited for phthalates. Data for the short -chain phthalate 
DEP indicate low toxicity. Data for the medium -chain phthalates DBP and DEHP also 
indicate low toxicity (Call et al. 2001b; Brown et al. 1996) . BBP, however,  was found to 
be highly toxic to sediment -dwelling organisms (in water exposure studies) (Call et al. 
2001a). For those medium -chain phthalates where PNECs in sediment could be 
calculated, they ranged from 14.8 mg/kg dw (DCHP ) to 97.8 mg/kg dw  (DMCHP) , and  
were well below the calculated values for maximum saturation in sediment (where 
maximum saturation in sediment was calculated using the substance ’s water solubility, 
organic carbon -water partition coefficient (K oc), and a default value of 0.04 for Canadia n 
sediment organic carbon content). Tissue residue calculations were done for those 
medium -chain phthalates where effects data were above water solubility limits or not 
available. The highest calculated tissue residue in sediment -dwelling organisms was for  
DIHepP at 0.05 mmol/kg, which indicates that internal concentrations for medium -chain 
phthalates are unlikely to reach levels sufficient to cause acute or chronic lethal effects. 
In sediment toxicity studies for the long -chain phthalates, no adverse effec ts were 
observed up to the highest concentrations tested, even  including those concentrations 
which exceeded maximum saturation limits for the substances under the study 
conditions . The calculated maximum tissue residue for DIDP , for example,  was 0.008 
mmo l/kg, which is below levels sufficient to cause acute or chronic toxicity by narcosis 
MoA.   
25 8.1.3  Toxicity to soil -dwelling organisms  
Limited soil toxicity studies available for some short -chain phthalate s (e.g.,  DMP ) and 
medium -chain phthalate s (e.g., BBP) indicate that these phthalates are not highly toxic 
to soil -dwelling organism s (Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b; ECCC 
2018 ). For the long -chain phthalates, CBR analyses for DINP and DIDP indicated that, 
up to soil saturation limits, internal con centrations of these substances are unlikely to 
reach levels sufficient to cause adverse effects (summarized in Environment Canada , 
Health Canada 2015 c,d).  
8.1.4  Toxicity to wildlife  
Exposure of wildlife to short -chain phthalates via inhalation was evaluated, as these 
substances have a relatively high residence time in air (summarized in Environment 
Canada , Health Canada 2015 e). An inhalation study for rats exposed to DEP (SCCNFP 
2002) was used to derive a PNEC of 49 mg/m3. 
Toxicity of phthalates to wildlife vi a food web exposure was not assessed 
quantitatively. Studies on secondary poisoning of wildlife were not found in the 
literature. Also, as noted previously in this report, phthalates are rapidly 
biotransformed in vertebrates and have low bioaccumulation an d biomagnification 
potential. Therefore, exposure  through the food web is not expected to pose a 
concern.  
 Ecological exposure assessment  
Phthalates have been measured in all environmental media including air, water, 
sediment, soil and biota in Canada and worldwide. Measured concentrations for the 
Phthalate Substance Grouping were presented in the SOS reports (Environment 
Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d). Measured concentrations for the additional 
phthalates in Canadian environmental media , as well as new  Canadian data for the 
Grouping phthalates,  are summarized in ECCC ( 2018). 
Pelletier et al. (2016) reported concentrations of 12 phthalates in Canadian surface 
sediment, sediment cores, and suspended sediment samples collected from locations in 
Atlantic Ca nada, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia (BC) over the period 2013 to 
2015. Samples were analyzed for five phthalates in the Phthalate Substance Grouping 
(DMP, DIBP, DCHP, DBzP and DINP) and seven of the additional phthalates (DEP, 
DPrP, DBP, BBP, DnHP, DEHP and DnOP). DPrP was not detected in any of the 208 
samples collected (detection limit 0.2 ng/g dw), while DCHP was found in only three 
samples of Ontario surface sediment (concentration range 6.3 to 20 ng/g dw, detection 
limit 0.9 ng/g dw) and DnHP wa s present in three samples of surface sediment (Ontario 
and BC) and one suspended sediment sample (Quebec) at concentrations of 4.8 to 11 
ng/g dw (detection limit 0.3 to 5 ng/g dw). Highest concentrations were measured for 
DEHP, which was also the only pht halate to be detected in all 208 samples. Maximum 
concentrations reported for DEHP were 8900 (Ontario surface sediment), 12  000 (BC  
26 surface sediment) and 6000 ng/g dw (Quebec suspended sediment, detection limit 1.0 
ng/g dw). Data for all 12 phthalates are provided in ECCC (2018).  
Low concentrations of DIBP, DEP and DBP were measured in five of 100 samples of 
lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush , collected in 2014 from locations in the Yukon and 
Ontario (McGoldrick et al. 2016). Fish tissues were analyzed for fo ur phthalates in the 
Phthalate Substance Grouping (DMP, DIBP, DCHP and DBzP) and six additional 
phthalates (DEP, DBP, BBP, DnHP, DEHP and DnOP). Concentrations of 2.9 and 4.4 
ng/g ww, 10.4 and 25.3 ng/g ww, and 39.1 ng/g ww were measured for DIBP, DEP, and  
DBP, respectively. The same study analyzed tissues from walleye, Sander vitreous , 
collected in 2014 from sites in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. Concentrations in the 20 
samples were below detection limits for all phthalates (range of detection limits was 13 
to 112 ng/g ww for both species). Data from the study are provided in ECCC (2018).  
Information on phthalate concentrations in wastewater in Canada was obtained through 
a sampling campaign carried out by ECCC’s Monitoring and Surveillance Program for 
the years  2014  to 2017. Samples of i nfluent and effluent of on -site wastewater 
treatment systems at 5 industrial facilities involved in the manufacture or use of 
phthalates were collected and analyzed, along with samples of influent and effluent of 
the off -site wastewater treatment systems (WWTS)5 to which the industrial sites direct 
their effluents. In addition to these 5 industrial sites and corresponding WWTS, the 
influents and effluents of 21 other Canadian WWTS were sampled and analyzed , 
bringing the tota l number of WWTS sampled over this four -year period to 31  (personal 
communication; unpublished environmental surveillance data received in 2015 and 
2018 by Ecological Assessment Division, ECCC , from Aquatic Contaminants Research 
Division, ECCC; unreferenced). Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in 
receiving waters near the WWTS discharge point were derived using effluent data from 
the off -site WWTS, while industrial on -site WWTS efflue nt data were used to inform 
potential phthalate sources as well as to estimate emission rates for similar types of 
facilities that were not monitored in the Monitoring and Surveillance Program. Detection 
limits ranged from 0.002  µg/L to 21 μg/L for individ ual phthalates. Removal efficiencies 
for industrial facilities with on-site treatment were greater than 50%, with half being 
greater than 90% and the lowest being less than 6%. Phthalate removal efficiencies at 
off-site WWTS ranged from 10 to 99% with 75% of WWTS having removal efficiencies  
of greater than 50%   
Surface water PECs were calculated using the following equation:  
                                            
5 In this assessment, the term “wastewater treatment system” refers to a system that collects do mestic, commercial 
and/or institutional household wastewater and possibly industrial wastewater (following discharge to the sewer), 
typically for treatment and eventual discharge to the environment. Unless otherwise stated, the term wastewater 
treatment sy stem makes no distinction of ownership or operator type (municipal, provincial, federal, indigenous, 
private, partnerships). Systems located at industrial operations and specifically designed to treat industrial effluents 
will be identified by the terms “o n-site wastewater treatment systems” or “industrial wastewater treatment systems.”

PEC:   predicted environmental  concentration in the receiving water body, µg/L  
Ceff:   phthalate concentratio n in the WWTS effluent, µg/L  
DF:   receiving water dilution factor (ratio of the WWTS effluent flow to the flow of 
the receiving water body), dimensionless.  
 
In the risk quotient approach ,6 the 10 th percentile flow of the receiving water body was 
used to calculate the DF. A 10th percentile flow is used to represent conditions during 
approximately the lowest flow over 30 -day period s, which are equivalent to typical 
chronic toxicity test durations. The  30-day low flows are expected and assumed to occur 
consecutively (summer). The resulting environmental concentrations are then compared 
directly to an effects concentration. Additionally, to estimate concentrations of 
phthalates near the point of release (near -field), the DF was limited to 10.  
 
Taking into account the longer period of time required for  phthalates to accumulate in an 
organism’s tissues, the DF for the cumulative approach7 was calculated using the 50th 
percentile flow  of the receiving water  body. The 50 th percentile flow is used as it is 
deemed to more appropriately reflect the average environmental concentrations that 
would lead to accumulation in the organism’s tissues. The use of this longer averaging 
period is also considered more appropriate for cumulative effects, as the highest 
concentrations of phthalates (used in the cumulative approach) occur at different times 
and locations. Short -term releases of aggregated quantities of phthalates are not 
expected to occur. In the case of t he cumulative approach , no limit to the DF was set 
because the cumulative approach is not restricted to the area (near -field) where the 
release occurs.  
PECs for industrial users and manufacturers of phthalates that were not covered by the 
sampling campaign  were calculated using emission factors obtained from similar 
industrial sites where monitoring data were available. Removal rates for on -site or off -
site WWTS that were not sampled were also estimated using the monitoring data for 
WWTS with similar types of treatment. In these cases, PECs were calculated using the  
following equation:  
PEC =(Q x C x E x (1−R))/(N x F x DF)

In the risk quotient approach , the 10th percentile flow of the receiving water body was 
used to calculate the DF. To estimate concentrations of phthalates near the point of 
release (near -field), the DF was limited to 10. Taking into account the longer period of 
time required for  phthalates to accumulate in an organism’s tissues, the DF for the 
cumulative approach was calculated using the 50th percentile flow. Also, no limit t o the 
DF was set because the cumulative approach is not restricted to the area (near -field) 
where the release occurs.  
Table 8 -4 shows the ranges of near -field PECs developed from the monitoring and 
modelling discussed above. Approximately 1500  PECs have be en generated this way. 
Of the quantities manufactured or used that were reported under the s.71 survey for 
2012, 95% have been accounted for by the monitoring and modelling. The remaining 
5% are small volume uses and uses that are not expected to lead to s ignificant aquatic 
release.  The four substances with the highest PECs were DIDP  (11.5 µg/L) , DINP (3.4 
µg/L), DEP (2.9 µg/L) and DCHP ( 2.8 µg/L) .

a Number of samples in which the phthalate was detected, divided by the total number of samples.  
b Modelled PEC  based on industrial emission factors and s.  71 quantities.  
An analysis of the locations where both industrial and municipal monitoring data were  
available suggests that phthalate loading from the known industrial phthalates 
manufacturers or users generally accounted for less than 10% of the total phthalate 
loading  in the off -site WWTS influents . This suggests that a large part of the phthalates 
found in the influents of off -site WWTS may be coming from other sources, such as 
wastewater from residential and commercial sources , industrial sources  not captured by 
the s. 71 survey reporting requirements , or landfill leachate . Several p hthalates were 
measured  at low concentrations in leachate samples collected from four landfill sites in 
2017 and these phthalates were also present in the influents of WWTS receiv ing the  
leachate s. While the number of phthalates and overall phthalate concentrations varied 
widely between WWTS, in general, DEP, DBP, BBP, DIBP and DEHP were detected 
most frequently and at relatively higher concentrations in both WWTS influents and 
leachate sam ples. It should be  noted that the solubility of substances in a real -world 
setting often differs from that measured under laboratory conditions and is influenced by 
many factors, including the physicochemical properties of the environment and the 
presence o f solubilizing substances such as humic acids in the water. A measured 
environmental concentration value was considered acceptable if it fell within a factor of 
10 of the laboratory -based value, and this was the case for all but three of the 
phthalates mea sured in the WWTS samples. For the three largest and least soluble 
phthalates, DIUP, DTDP and DUP, measured or modelled concentrations exceeded 
some modelled water solubility estimates but were within a factor of 10 for other 
estimates. The PEC values for these phthalates were considered suitable for reporting 
in the assessment as they were within the range of the extremely low solubility 
predicted for these substances.  
 Characterization of ecological risk 
8.3.1  General considerations  
Phthalates are released both during various industrial activities and continuously 
through consumer use of products and manufactured items that contain phthalates, with 
environmental releases occurring primarily to water  via off -site wastewater treatment 
systems . Phthalates are not chemically bound to polymer matrices, so they can migrate 
slowly to the polymer surface, and then possibly enter the environment. Phthalates will  
31 biodegrade rapidly and are not expected to be recalcitrant in the environment. 
Degradatio n may be slightly slower under anaerobic conditions , thereby increas ing the 
duration of exposure to organisms. According to information about releases and the 
predicted distribution in the environment, aquatic and soil -dwelling organisms close to 
release s ites will have the highest potential for exposure. Phthalate concentrations are 
expected to decrease with increasing distance from points of  release ; however, long -
range atmospheric transport potential has been identified for the short -chain phthalate 
DMP (Morin 2003). There is also evidence that other phthalates are transported in the 
atmosphere on fine particles (Ruzickov á et al. 2016).   
The aquatic compartment is thought to be the key receiving environmental compartment 
for all phthalates. Releases to th e aquatic compartment are continuous, and even the 
long-chain phthalates, which are highly hydrophobic, are detected in water. Distribution 
of phthalates between environmental media depends primarily on which medium they 
are emitted to and also on their wa ter solubility and partition coefficients. Short -chain 
and some medium -chain phthalates are expected to reside predominantly in water , and 
the long -chain and other medium -chain phthalates are expected to partition to 
sediments and adsorb to particles. Toxi city data available for soil - and sediment -
dwelling organisms indicate that effects are not likely to occur at environmentally 
relevant concentrations. No toxicity below solubility limits or soil/sediment saturation 
levels was found for long -chain phthalat es and some of the larger medium -chain 
phthalates (e.g., DIHepP, B84P). The focus of this assessment is therefore on aquatic 
organisms, for which deleterious effects from phthalate exposure have been observed. 
Acute effects of short - and medium -chain phtha lates in aquatic organisms range from 
high (LC 50 of 0.08 mg/L) to moderate (LC 50 of 10 mg/L).  
8.3.2  Cumulative risk assessment using grouping and additional 
phthalates  
Where similar chemicals are potentially exerting combined effects on organisms through 
a commo n mode of action (MoA), it is appropriate to consider assessing risk from the 
cumulative exposure, rather than considering risk from each individual substance 
separately. In determining whether to conduct a CRA, the most important consideration 
is whether there is co -occurrence of the substances in one or more environmental 
media. In the case of phthalates, there are several lines of evidence to suggest the 
potential for co -occurrence in the environment. These include their uses, releases, 
degradation proce sses, and presence in wastewater treatment system effluents. The 
selection of which CRA method to use depends on whether there is a common MoA 
among the substances. There is sufficient evidence that , under short -term exposures,  
all phthalates are acting th rough narcosis and can be considered together in a CRA 
based on concentration addition (CA).  
The selection of the specific CRA method depends on what type s of data are available 
to characterize the effect and exposure concentrations of each substance. The Sum of 
Internal Toxic Units method  was chosen from among the various CA methods available. 
This approach involves summing toxic units on the basis of internal toxic units (i.e.,  
32 concentrations in organism tissues), rather than on the basis of external (i.e., water) 
exposure concentrations of substances. This is also referred to as a CBR approach.  
The sum of internal toxic units (ITU mix) for a group of substances is calculated using the 
equation shown below. For this CRA, the internal toxic uni t for each substance is 
estimated by multiplying its estimated concentration in water (PEC i) by the 
bioaccumulation factor (BAF i), and dividing by the critical body residue (CBR) 
associated with chronic lethality in aquatic organisms (0.2 mmol/kg for narco sis; 
McCarty and Mackay 1993), multiplying CBR i by MW i (the molecular weight of the 
substance), and finally applying an assessment factor (AF) . An AF of 5 was applied 
because the CBR is based on lethality, so the AF is intended to extrapolate from 
median l ethal effects to sublethal low - or no -level effects. A larger factor was not 
deemed necessary since the CBR is already for chronic (long -term) exposure .

Further detail about CRA methods, including the Sum of Internal Toxic Units (ITU) 
method, are found in a separate document ( Environment Canada , Health Canada 
2015 e). 
All 28 phthalates (the 14 substances in the Phthalate Substance Grouping and 14 
additional phthalates) were included in a CRA calculation. Although no eff ects are 
typically observed for the long -chain phthalates when tested individually up to their 
solubility limits, they are the highest volume phthalates in Canadian commerce , and 
monitoring data shows that some of them are present in wastewater effluents a nd 
surface waters at high concentrations.  The approach chosen (ITU method) accounts for 
the possibility that they might still be contributing to cumulative effects  based on lethality 
due to the narcosis MoA.  Support for this approach is provided by Mayer a nd 
Reichenberg (2006) , who found that highly hydrophobic substances that do not 
demonstrate narcotic effects on their own could still contribute to the toxicity of complex 
mixtures.   
For the ITU calculations, the highest PEC determined for each phthalate was used, 
resulting in a conservative assumption that the highest concentrations of all phthalates 
were co -occurring at the same site. The CBR value used (in the denominator) was 0.2 
mmol/kg  for chronic lethal exposures (McCarty and Mackay 1993). The resul ts of the 
ITU calculations are shown in Appendix B  (Table B -1). The sum of internal toxic units 
across the 28 phthalates , prior to application of an assessment factor,  is 0.035 . The 
highest toxic unit in the mixture is for BBP ( 0.099 ). Eleven  phthalates account for 
approximately 95% of the cumulative risk based on narcosis : BBP, DIOP, D911P, 
DCHP, DINP, DIDP, DIBP, DEHP, DBP, DEP, and DIHepP (Appendix B, Figure B -1). 
When  the AF of 5 is  applied to the sum of  ITUs, the final ITU mix is 0.2 (0.035 x5). This 
indicates that there is low risk from the mixture . An examination of contributions of the  
33 various phthalates to the mixture toxicity indicates that the overall toxicity is largely 
dominated by one substance, BBP (see Appendix B1).  
In addition to determining the final ITU mix based on the highest PEC for each phthalate, 
an ITU mix was also calculated based on the median PEC for each phthalate. This was 
done to provide an indication of the relative risk under more realistic or typical 
conditions. R esults of these calculations are also shown in Appendix B (Table B-2). An 
ITU mix of 0.006 was determined based on median PECs.  
  
8.3.3  Calculation of individual risk quotients and consideration of 
endocrine effects  
In the SOS reports (Environment Canada , Health Canada 2015 a,b,c,d), risk quotient 
(RQ) analyses for the aquatic medium were done for the short -chain and some of the 
medium -chain phthalates. For the other medium -chain and the long -chain phthalates, 
their low water solubility and high hydrophobicity sugg est that dietary exposure will be 
the major route of exposure for organisms, rather than the surrounding medium. For this 
reason, tissue residues were calculated on the basis of bioaccumulation factors and 
water solubility and compared with the critical bo dy residues (CBRs) for narcosis to 
estimate the potential for the substance to reach internal concentrations that are 
sufficiently high to cause effects through baseline narcosis. None of the individual RQ or 
CBR results for substances in the Phthalate Substance Grouping indicated a risk of 
harm to aquatic organisms through narcotic effects. It should be noted that the CBRs 
were conservative because they were calculated using the maximum water solubility for 
each substance and assumed 10 0% bioavailability; they  would be even lower if actual 
environmental concentrations had been used instead  of water solubility limits .   
The ITU approach used in this assessment employs lethality CBRs based on data for 
narcotic chemicals. However, effects from specific modes of action, including endocrine 
activity, may occur at lower exposure levels than narcotic effects. A cumulative 
approach based on endocrine activity is not presently viable given the data limitations. 
Therefore, in addition to the CRA  based on narcosis, risk quotients (RQs) for individual 
phthalates in the Grouping were also calculated, using PNECs and PECs as determined 
in Tables 8 -3 and 8 -4, respectively (see Table 8 -5). Although RQs were presented for 
the Grouping phthalates in the SOS reports, these were recalculated for this 
assessment using more recent PNECs  and PECs , specifically those shown in Tables 8 -
3 and 8 -4. The results  of the RQ analysis are  presented in T able 8 -5. The analysis 
considered both  median and highest PEC values , with highest PECs representing 
‘worst case’ exposure conditions and median PEC values indicative of exposure under 
more realistic or typical environmental conditions . Highest PECs ranged from 0.01 to 
11.5 µg/L, while median PEC values were 0.0005 to 0.199 µg/L. Corresponding RQs 
were 2.5 × 10-4 to 23.3 for highest exposure concentrations, while much lower RQs of 
8.3 × 10-6 to 2.84 were determined based on median exposur e values.   
34 RQs were less than one for all 14 phthalates in the Phthalate Substance Grouping, 
indicating low potential for harm to aquatic organisms in the Canadian environment.  
However, the RQ based on impaired spermatogenesis and reduced embryo production  
in zebrafish calculated for the additional phthalate , DEHP , exceeded one, indicating a 
potential for risk . Risk quotients for the other 13 additional phthalates, which are not 
being assessed, are presented in ECCC (201 8) and were all less than one .

8.3.4  Consideration of the lines of evidence and conclusion  
To characterize the ecological risk of phthalates in the Phthalate Substance Grouping, 
technical information for various lines of evidence was considered (as discussed in the 
relevant sections of this report) and qualitatively weigh ted. The key lines of evidence 
supporting the assessment conclusion are presented in Table 8 -6. The level of 
confidence refers to the combined influence of data quality and variability, data gaps, 
causality, plausibility and any extrapolation required with in the line of evidence. The 
relevance refers to the impact the line of evidence has when determining the potential to 
cause harm in the Canadian environment. Qualifiers used in the analysis ranged from 
low to high, with the assigned weight having five pos sible outcomes.

c Weight is assigned to each line of evidence according to the overall combined weights for level of confidence and

Phthalates examined in this screening assessment are not persistent, although all 
biodegrade more slowly under low oxygen conditions , and short -chain phthalates such 
as DMP may remain resident in air for periods of longer than two days and may be 
found in areas far from the source of release. Phthalates are used in a variety of 
consumer, commercial and industrial applications, creating the potential for widespread 
release into the Canadian environment. Some phthalates, in particular DINP and the 
long-chain phthalates DIDP and DUP, are manufactu red and/or imported in large 
quantities . Constant release of phthalates into the environment may result in continuous 
exposure for organisms residing in near -field receiving media. Phthalates are released 
mainly into air and water, and while all phthalates  are predicted to distribute into water, 
only short -chain phthalates such as DMP are predicted to distribute appreciably to air. 
Therefore, water is the primary medium of concern for the phthalates being considered 
in this assessment.    
Phthalates are bio available but do not have high bioaccumulation potential because of 
high rate s of biotransformation in biota. Long-chain phthalates demonstrate low toxicity  
to aquatic organisms , while short - and medium -chain phthalates exhibit moderate to 
high toxicity. P hthalates are efficiently metabolized, with the formation of less toxic 
metabolites that can be readily excreted. Narcosis is an important mode of toxic action 
for phthalates. However, there is strong evidence that some phthalates may also elicit 
effects t hrough other modes of action. In particular, some phthalates may have the 
ability to adversely affect the normal functioning of endocrine systems , such as  gonadal 
development , in organisms. While in vivo  evidence of effects on the endocrine system  
has only  been definitively demonstrated for a small number of phthalates, such as 
DEHP, an analysis of in vivo , in vitro , and in silico  data suggests that many phthalates  
38 possess properties that could allow them to adversely influence endocrine activity under 
some  conditions.  There are considerable in vivo  data for medium -chain phthalates  in 
mammals indicating endocrine effects on the development of the male reproductive 
tract.  Given that pathways are highly conserved within vertebrates, it might be expected 
that, if tested, many of the data -poor medium -chain phthalates could also show effects 
on endocrine systems in aquatic species, such as fish. 
An analysis of risk quotients determined that all 14 phthalates in the Phthalate 
Substance Grouping present a low risk o f causing harm to aquatic species under  
current exposure levels in the Canadian environment. One additional phthalate, DEHP , 
has the potential to cause adverse effects in populations of aquatic organisms in 
Canada at current exposure levels. The risk quoti ent analysis considered both highest 
and median predicted exposure concentrations (PECs) in order to compare ‘worst case’ 
environmental exposures with those occurring under more realistic or typical conditions. 
Risk quotients based on median PECs were abou t 10 to 200 times lower than those 
derived using highest PECs, indicating that organisms are most commonly exposed to 
substantially lower environmental concentrations than th ose represented by highest 
PEC value s. The risk quotient for DEHP, however, exceeded one when  both the highest 
PEC (risk quotient 23.3) and median PEC (risk quotient 2.84)  were used . The analysis 
of cumulative risk also determined a much lower risk under median or typical 
environmental exposure  concentrations as compared with highest PECs. The sum of 
internal toxic units , considering narcotic effects,  for the 28 phthalates considered in the 
cumulative risk analysis was 0.2 when highest PECs were used and 0.006 when based 
on median PECs.  
Consider ing all available lines of evidence presented in this screening assessment, 
there is low risk of harm to the environment from the 14 phthalates in the Phthalate 
Substance Grouping (DMP, DIBP, CHIBP, BCHP, DCHP, DBzP, B79P, DMCHP, 
DIHepP, BIOP, B84P, DINP, DIDP and DUP). However , the additional  phthalate , 
DEHP, is considered to have  potential to cause ecological harm in Canada and 
therefore  meet s the criteria under section 64 (a) of CEPA. DEHP was assessed by 
Environment Canada and Health Canada in 1994 under  the Priority Substances 
Assessment Program. Th at assessment concluded that DEHP posed a risk to human 
health in Canada, but was not able to conclude on the potential for risk to the 
environment due to insufficient information. Sufficient data were gathere d in the course 
of this assessment to now conclude on the potential for  DEHP to cause ecological harm 
in Canada.  
In addition to DEHP, certain short - and medium -chain phthalates  (i.e., DMP, DEP, 
DPrP, DIBP, BCHP, DCHP, DBzP, B79P, DMCHP, BIOP, DBP, BBP, DnHP, and 
DINP) , as well as the long -chain phthalate DnOP,  may be highly hazardous because of 
their potential for effects on the endocrine  system . However, under conservative 
consideration of current exposure levels, these substances are not expected to po se a 
risk.   
39 8.3.5  Uncertainties in evaluation of ecological risk 
The nature and extent of the potential for phthalates evaluated in this assessment to 
cause adverse effects on the endocrine system in aquatic organisms is a key 
uncertainty . Effects on e ndocrine systems have  been extensively studied for a few 
phthalates, but large data gaps remain for the majority of them. Additionally, there are 
inconsistent/variable study methodologies and sometimes conflicting results. Certain 
longer chain phthalates (>C7) may h ave some minor endocrine activity,  or might 
enhance the activity of other endocrine -active substances, but the evidence does not 
seem to indicate that this is a significant effect for these phthalates . Consequently, while 
an analysis of data for endocrine activities (see Table s 8-1 and 8 -2) suggests that many 
phthalates can potentially influence endocrine activity, the results were not sufficient to 
support a conclusion, under section 64 of CEPA, for all phthalates under assessment.  
However, phthalates with  evidence for endocrine activity will be flagged for further 
evaluation in the event of a change to exposure conditions (for example, through 
increased use quantities) or receipt of additional toxicity information.  
The lack of in vivo  aquatic toxicity dat a on effects in endocrine  systems is also an 
important uncertainty in the assessment. These data are not available for many of the 
phthalates examined in this assessment and would be particularly useful for the 
medium -chain phthalates as substances in this subgrouping exhibit the highest a quatic 
toxicity and are therefore expected to be more reactive than the short - and long -chain 
phthalates. Also, for those phthalates that have been tested for effects to the endocrine 
system , there is often a lack of testing at low, environmentally relevan t concentrations . 
Therefore, although research is ongoing, it is currently unknown whether they might still 
cause adverse effects at concentrations found in the environment.  
There are very limited empirical effects data of phthalates for soil - and sediment -
dwelling organisms. Measurements of phthalates in soils and sediments have also been 
limited. Although available data suggest low concern for these environmental media, a 
more robust dataset would help characterize effects in these media more clea rly. 
There is uncertainty with respect to the sources of phthalates in the aquatic 
environment. For DEHP, modelling suggests that aquatic releases from industrial users 
(i.e., plastic products manufacturers) may be a potential source. Furthermore, 
consider ing the measured concentrations of phthalates in WWTS that receive both 
domestic and industrial wastewaters, the contribution of industrial activities may not be 
the main source of phthalates in most cases. Rather, the main sources are potentially 
linked t o contribution from consumer or commercial inputs or landfill leachate, but it is 
not possible to specifically attribute the sources.

 Potential to cause harm to human health  
 Exposure assessment  
The exposure assessment for human health was completed using  available and 
relevant data, including biomonitoring data, environmental media and food occurrence 
data, and exposures estimated from the use of products available to consumers. 
Biomonitoring data considered for the exposure assessment included data from the 
Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) Cycles 1 and 2 (Health Canada 2011b, 
2013), the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative (FNBI) (AFN 2013), the Plastics and 
Personal Care Product Use in Pregnancy survey (P4) (Arbuckle et al. 2016), the 
Maternal In fant Research on Environmental Chemicals study (MIREC) (Arbuckle et al. 
2014), the Maternal Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals – Child Development 
Plus study (MIREC -CD Plus) (personal communication from Environmental Health 
Sciences and Radiation D irectorate [EHSRD], HC, to the ESRAB, HC, October 2013, 
2014, unreferenced), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) (CDC 2014). Since the publication of the draft screening assessment, 
several phthalate metabolites have also been  measured in CHMS Cycle 5 (Health 
Canada 2019). Daily intakes based on these data are not expected to exceed those 
estimated from the previously reported biomonitoring studies.  
9.1.1  Short -chain phthalates  
DMP  
Exposure estimates were calculated using human biomonitoring  data as well as  data on  
DMP occurrence in  indoor air, soil, dust, food and cosmetic s. They are presented in the 
SCP SOS report (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015a) and summarized below. 
Since the publication of the SOS report , DMP has be en analyzed in foods included in 
the 2013 Canadian Total Diet Study (TDS) . While it was not quantified in any food 
composites above the method detection limit in Canada (average MDL=1.13 ng/g; Cao 
et al. 2015) , it was reported in  fish in the United States (Martins et al. 2016),  indoor air  
and dust  in homes in the United States (Tran and Kannan 2015 ; Subedi et al. 2017 ), in 
agricultural soils in Canada (Khosravi and Price 2015) and in various studies 
internationally.  In addition, it was reported in mineral w ater and soda water in China 
(Yang et al.2017), but was not detected in bottled water in Iran (Pourzamani et al. 
2017). However, these reported values did not change the previously presented 
exposure estimates (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015a).   
The highest exposed group according to biomonitoring data (all sources, MIREC -CD 
Plus) are male children aged 2 to 3 year s, with median and 95 th percentile intakes of 
0.19 and 0.66 µg/kg bw/day, respectively. For older populations ( 12 years and over ) the 
highest exposed group (all sources, NHANES) is males aged 12 to 19 year s, with 
median and 95 th percentile intakes of 0.042 and 0.29 µg/kg bw/day , respectively.   
41 The subpopulation with the highest exposure to DMP from environmental media and 
food consi sted of breastfed infants , with total daily intake of 0.019 and 0.26 µg/kg 
bw/day  estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, 
respectively.  
Estimated daily intake of DMP from use of diaper cream (infants aged 0 to 0.5 y ears, 
dermal) was 2.7  µg/kg bw/day  (lower -end exposure scenario) and 8.2 µg/kg bw/day  
(upper -bounding exposure scenario ). For adults aged 20 years and over, estimated 
intake s from the use of hairsprays and hair dyes were 6.6 µg/kg bw/day (lower end) and 
20 µg/kg bw/day (upper bound) and 140 µg/kg bw/event (lower end) and 420 (upper 
bound) µg/kg bw/event, respectively.8

Canada 2015a).  
9.1.2  Medium -chain phthalates an d additional phthalates  
Medium -chain phthalates  
 
For detailed information on all 11 medium -chain phthalates in this section, please refer 
to the MCP SOS report and the DINP SOS report (Environment Canada, Health 
Canada 2015b ; Environment Canada, Health Can ada 2015c ).  
DIBP  
Exposure estimates were calculated using biomonitoring  data as well as  data on  DIBP 
occurrence in air, drinking water, dust, food , plastic items and cosmetics. They are 
presented in the MCP SOS report (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) and 
summarized below. Since the publication of the SOS report , DIBP has been analyzed in 
foods included in the 2013 Canadian Total Diet Study ( TDS). DIBP was detected in 27 
of 159 composite food samples at an average MDL of 7.25 ng/g (mean of positives =  
8.26 ng/g, range of 2.41 to 39.8 ng/g ; Cao et al. 2015). DIBP has been reported in 
100% of indoor air  (range: 0.035 -0.67 µg/m3, median: 0.18  µg/m3, mean : 0.21 µg/m3) 
and household dust (range: 2.22-25.6 µg/g, median: 6.14 µg/g, mean : 7.25 µg/g) 
samples  from 51 homes in Canada (Health Canada 2017 ). DIBP has also been 
detected in indoor air  and dust  in homes in the United States  (Tran and Kannan 2015 ; 
Subedi et al. 2017 ) and in various studies internationally.  DIBP was also reported in 
certain toys and childcare articles  in Canada (range: 0.003 -22%; 5 of 27 samples; 
Health Canada 2018 a) and in toys in New Zealand (Ashworth et al.  2018) , and in 
household residual waste plastic in Denmark (Pvinenko et al. 2016) . It was also 
                                            
8 10% dermal absorption factor was used for all products except d iaper creams (see approach for 
characterizing dermal absorption for DMP in SCP SOS report (Environment Canada , Health Canada 
2015 a).  
42 reported in jeans , and to subsequent ly rub-off to legs in adults  (as measured via dermal 
wipes) , in China (Gong et al. 201 6) and in cotton and polyester fabrics purchased in the 
United States (Saini et al. 2016) . It was not detected in baby teethers in Thailand 
(Makkliang et al. 2017).  However, these reported values did not change the previously 
presented exposure estimates (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b ). 
The highest exposed group according to biomonitoring data (all sources, CHMS  Cycle 
2, 2009 -2011, n = 2547, 3 -79 years ) is male children aged 6 to 11 years, with estimated 
mean intakes of 1.5  µg/kg bw/day and median and 95 th percentile intakes of 0.76 an d 
5.3 µg/kg bw/day, respectively. For older populations (12 years and over ), the highest 
exposed group (all sources, CHMS) is 20 -to-49-year-old females , with mean intakes of 
0.56 µg/kg bw/day and median and 95 th percentile intakes of 0.46 and 1.4 µg/kg 
bw/day, respectively.  
The subpopulation with the highest exposure from environmental media and food 
consisted of breastfed infants , with total daily intakes of 1.6 and 5.9 µg/kg bw/day 
estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, 
respectively. Daily intakes for DIBP for infants (0  to 1.5 years) from exposure from 
mouthing plastic toys and childcare articles were estimated at 62.8 and 251  µg/kg 
bw/day on the basis of lower -end and upp er-bounding exposure scenarios, respectively. 
Estimated daily intakes for infants from dermal exposure to plastic items , based on a 
lower -end and upper -bounding exposure scenarios, were 30.7 and 245.3 µg/kg bw/day, 
respectively. For adults exposed to plast ic items (females aged 20 years and over), 
estimated daily intakes , based on lower -end and upper -bounding exposure scenarios , 
were 30.8 and 96.3 µg/kg bw/day , respectively. Estimated daily intake of DIBP from use 
of body lotions was 0.03 µg/kg bw/day for adults aged 20 to 59 years.  
DCHP  
Exposure estimates were calculated using data on DCHP occurrence in dust and food. 
Since the publication of the MCP SOS report, DCH P has been analyzed in foods 
included in the 2013 Canadian TDS but was detected in only 1 of 159 composite food 
samples , at a concentration of 64.9 ng/g (average MDL=1.58 ng/g ; Cao et al. 2015). 
However, this new information did not significantly ch ange the exposure estimates 
presented previously (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b).  
 
The subpopulation with the highest exposure from environmental media and food 
consisted of children ( aged 6 months to 4 years), with total daily intakes of 0.0018  and 
0.15 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding 
concentrations, respectively. For populations aged 12 years and over , the highest 
exposed group is adolescents ( aged 12 to 19 year s), with total daily intakes of <0.001 
and 0.065 μg/kg bw/day estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding 
concentrations, respectively.  
  
43 Intakes were not calculated on the basis of biomonitoring data, because the majority of 
samples were mea sured below the limit of detection (CHMS  Cycles 1 (2007 -09) and 2 
(2009 -11), MIREC -CD Plus, MIREC, P4).  
 
DMCHP  
Exposure estimates were calculated using data on DMCHP occurrence in dust. They 
are presented in the MCP SOS report (Environment Canada, Health C anada 2015b) 
and summarized below.  
The subpopulation with the highest exposure from dust consisted of infants (0  to 6 
months old) with total daily intake of 0.0027 and 0.054 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the 
basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concent rations, respectively. For 
populations aged 12 years and over , total daily intakes are <0.001 μg/kg bw/day.  
DBzP  
Exposure estimates were calculated using data on DBzP occurrence in dust. Since the 
publication of the MCP SOS report , DBzP has been analyzed in foods included in the 
2013 Canadian TDS and was not quantified above the MDL (average MDL=12.7; Cao 
et al. 2015). Exposure estimates for DBzP are presented in the MCP SOS report 
(Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) and summarized below.  
The subpopu lation with the highest exposure from dust consisted of infants (0  to 6 
months old), with total daily intakes of 0.016 and 0.097 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the 
basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, respectively. For 
populations  aged 12 years and over , total daily intakes of <0.001 and 0.0011 μg/kg 
bw/day estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, 
respectively, are observed for all age groups.  
B84P  
Exposure estimates were calculated using data on B84P  occurrence in dust and plastic 
items. They are presented in the MCP SOS report (Environment Canada, Health 
Canada 2015b) and summarized below.  Since the publication of the SOS report, B84P 
was not detected  (27 samples)  in certain toys and childcare articles  in Canada (Health 
Canada 2018 a). These recent Canadian data affirm  the conservative  nature of the  
exposure estimates from dermal contact with plastic items presented previously 
(Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b).   
44 The subpopulation with the highest exposure from dust9 consisted of infants (0  to 6 
months old), with total daily intakes of 0.0063 and 0.047 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the 
basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, respectively.  
Estimated daily intakes for infants  from dermal exposure to B84P from plastic items , 
calculated on the basis of lower -end and upper -bounding exposure scenarios, were 2.7 
and 21.6 µg/kg bw/day, respectively. For adults exposed to plastic items (females  aged 
20 years and older), lower -end and upper -bounding estimate s of daily intake were 2.7 
and 8.5 µg/kg bw/day, respectively.  
DIHepP  
 
Exposure estimates were calculated using data on DIHe pP occurrence in dust.  They are 
presented in the MCP SOS report (Environment Canada, Health Can ada 2015b) and 
summarized below.  
 
The subpopulation with the highest exposure from dust consisted of infants (0  to 6 
months old), with total daily intakes of 0.096 and 1.1 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the 
basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentra tions, respectively ( for more 
details refer to Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b ). For populations aged 12 
years and over , the highest exposed group is adolescents ( aged 12 to 19 year s), with 
total daily intakes of 0.0011 and 0.013 μg/kg bw/day estimated on the basis of central 
tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, respectively.  
B79P  
Exposure estimates were calculated using data on  B79P occurrence in  dust and plastic 
items. They are presented in the MCP SOS report (Environment Canada, Healt h 
Canada 2015b) and summarized below.  Since the publication of the SOS report, B79P 
was not detected  (27 samples)  in certain toys and childcare articles  in Canada (Health 
Canada 2018 a). These recent Canadian data affirm  the conservative  nature of the  
exposure estimates from dermal contact with plastic items presented previously 
(Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b).  
The subpopulation with the highest exposure from dust consisted of infants (0  to 6 
months  old), with total daily intakes of 0.0063 an d 0.047 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the 
basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, respectively. For 
populations aged 12 years and over , total daily intakes are <0.001 μg/kg bw/day.  
Estimated daily intakes for infants from dermal exposure t o B79P from plastic items, as 
calculated on the basis of lower -end and upper -bounding exposure scenarios , were 2.7 
                                            
9 In the absence of an appropriate analytical method for measuring B84P in dust, and because similar 
quantities and uses we re reported in Canada (Environment Canada 2014), B79P dust intakes were used 
as a surrogate for B84P dust exposure .    
45 and 21.6 µg/kg bw/day , respectively. For adults exposed to plastic items (females aged 
20 years and over), estimated daily intakes , based on lower -end and upper -bounding 
exposure scenarios , were 2.7 and 8.5 µg/kg bw/day respectively.  
DINP  
Exposure estimates were calculated using biomonitoring  data as well as data on  DINP 
occurrence in dust, food, and plastic items. They are presented in the DINP SOS report 
(Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015c) and summarized below.  Since the 
publication of the SOS report,  DINP has been reported in 100% of indoor air (range: 
0.003 -2 µg/m3, median: 0.012  µg/m3, mean: 0.1 µg/m3) and household dust (ra nge: 79 -
1443 µg/g, median: 260 µg/g, mean : 323 µg/g) samples in 51 homes in Canada ( Health 
Canada 2017 ). DINP has  also been reported internationally  to be present  in indoor air 
(Blanchard et al. 2014, Takeuchi et al. 2014 ; Luongo et al. 2016; Wei et al. 2017; 
Giovanoulis et al. 2018 ), dust (Blanchard et al. 2014; Luongo and Östman 2015 ; 
Giovanoulis et al. 2018 ), soils ( Tran et al. 2015)  and tap water (Yang et al. 2014) . In 
addition, DINP was not detected  (27 samples)  in certain toys and childcare articles  in 
Canada  (Health Canada 2018 a). DINP was measured in toys and childcare articles 
above the regulated limit in 10% of toys tested in Europe (ECHA 2018) . It was also 
reported to be present in toys in New Zealand (Ashworth et al. 2018) and Isr ael 
(Negeve et  al. 2018).  DINP was also reported in cotton and polyester fabrics purchased 
in the United States (Saini et al. 2016).  However, these reported values did not change 
the exposure estimates presented previously  (Environment Canada, Health Canada 
2015 c). 
The highest exposed group according to biomonitoring data (all sources, NHANES) is 
male children aged 6 to 11 years, with mean intakes of 4.6 µg/kg bw/day, and median 
and 95 th percentile intakes of 4.2 and 25 µg/kg bw/day , respectively. For older 
populations ( aged 12 year s and over ), the highest exposed group (all sources, 
NHANES) is 12 -to-19-year-old males , with mean intakes of 3.0 µg/kg bw/day, and 
median and 95 th percentile intakes of 2.6 and 33 µg/kg bw/day, respectively. For adults 
aged 20 years and over , daily intakes are 2.8 μg/kg bw/day (mean), 2.4 μg/kg bw/day 
(median), and 24 μg/kg bw/day ( 95th percentile) for males and 2.3 μg/kg bw/day 
(mean), 1.9 μg/kg bw/day (median), and 23 μg/kg bw/day ( 95th percentile) for females . 
The subpopulation with the high est exposure from dust and food consisted of children 
(aged 6 months  to 4 y ears), with total daily intakes of 1.8 and 20.8 µg/kg bw/day 
estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, 
respectively. For populations aged 12 years and over , the highest exposed group is 
adolescents ( aged 12 to 19 year s), with total daily intakes of 1.0 and 11. 9 μg/kg bw/day 
estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, 
respectively  (see Appendix D, Table D -6). 
Daily intakes for DINP for infants ( aged 0 to 1.5 y ears) from mouthing plastic toys and 
childcare articles , were estimated on the basis of lower -end and upper -bounding 
exposure scenarios, to be 30 and 120 µg/kg bw/day, respectively. Estimated daily  
46 intake s for infants from dermal exposure to plastic items , based on lower -end and 
upper -bounding exposure scenarios, were 1.1 and 8.6 µg/kg bw/day, respectively . For 
females aged 20 years and over , estimated daily intakes from dermal exposure to 
plastic items , based on lower -end and upper -bounding exposure scenarios,  were 1.1 
and 3.4 µg/kg bw/day, respectively.  
CHIBP, BCHP and BIOP  
Given the absence of reporting to the s . 71 industry survey (CHIBP, BCHP and BIOP), 
non-detection in dust (CHIBP and BCHP), non -detection in products available to  
consumers (BCHP; emission chamber study, NRC 2012),  non-detection in children’s 
toys (CHIBP; Health Canada 2018 a), negligible modelled indoor air concentrations 
(CHIBP), and the absence of information as to their presence in product databases 
(CHIBP, BCHP and BIOP), general population exposure to CHIBP, BCHP and BIOP 
from environmental media and products available to  consumers is expected to be 
negligible (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b).  
Additional medium -chain phthalates  
BBP  
Biomonitoring  
Monobenzylphthalate (MBzP), the main monoester metabolite of BBP, was monitored in 
the CHMS Cycle 1 (2007 –2009 , n = 3325, 6 -49 years ) and Cycle 2 (2009 –2011 , n = 
2559, 3 -79 years ), with 100% detection in all samples (Health Canada 2011b, 2013). 
Additionally, MBzP was measured as part of the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative 
(FNBI) of the Assembly of First Nati ons (n= 492 for on -reserve and Crown -land 
population s aged 20 years and over). Urine concentrations for MBzP (geometric mean) 
were reported to be statistically higher in FNBI sample s than those  observed in the 
CHMS Cycle 1 for population aged 20 years and older population (AFN 2013).  
MBzP was also monitored by Health Canada in three cohort studies : P4 (n = 80 
pregnant  women and 55 infants, 1260  individual maternal spot samples  collected over 
up to 5 visits and 84 in dividual infant spot urines collected over up to 2 visits  (Arbuckle 
et al. 2016, Table S3 ), MIREC (n = 1788  pregnant women, spot urine samples : Arbuckle 
et al. 2014 ), and MIREC -CD Plus ( 198 children aged 2 to 3 year s, 1 spot sample per 
individual ; personal  communication from Environmental Health Sciences and Radiation 
Directorate [EHSRD], HC, to ESRAB, HC, October 2013, 2014, unreferenced ). All th ree 
studies  reported high detection frequencies of MBzP (100 %, 99% and 94%, 
respectively) .  
Finally, in the United States , the NHANES also monitored MBzP in urine during survey 
years 1999  to 2012 and reported  high detection frequencies (CDC 2014).   
47 Using the CHMS  (Cycle 2) , P4, MIREC and MIREC -CD Plus datasets, reverse 
dosimetry intake estimates were generated. Metabolite concentrations were adjusted for 
urine dilution using the creatinine correction method, a commonly used method for 
phthalate biomonitoring assessment (Fromme 2007; Frederiksen et al. 2013; 
Christensen et al. 2014; US CPSC CHAP 2014). Daily creat inine excretion rates for 
participants were estimated using the Mage equation. Biomonitoring intakes are 
presented in Table 9-1 below (see Appendix C for further information on the 
methodology).

The highest exposed group according to biomonitoring data (all sources, CHMS) is 
children aged 3 to 5 year s with median and 95 th percentile intakes of 0.76 and 4.5 
µg/kg bw/day, respectively. For older populations  (aged 12 years and over) , the highest  
48 exposed group (all sources, P4) is pregnant women ( aged 19 years and over ) with 
median and 95 th percentile intakes of 0.31 and 3.01 µg/kg bw/day, respectively.  
Environmental media and food  
The subpopulation with the hi ghest exposure to BBP from environmental media and 
food consisted of children ( aged 0.5 to 4 y ears ), with total daily intakes of 0.58 and 3.01 
µg/kg bw/day estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding 
concentrations, respectively (Appendix D, Table D-1a).  
Indoor air and dust  
BBP was measured in indoor air in Canadian homes in Ottawa and Toronto ( detected in 
100% of 51 homes , range: 0.72 -65.9 ng/m3, median: 2.8 ng/m3, mean : 4.8 ng/m3; 
Health Canada 2017 ). Another  study measured BBP in indoor air in 75 Canadian 
homes; all samples were less than the limit of detection  (LOD)  (LOD was not reported; 
Zhu et al. 2007). BBP has also been measured in indoor air in homes in the United 
States  and internationally (Fromme et al. 2004; Rudel et al. 2010; Bergh et al. 2011a; 
Pei et al. 2013; Blanchard et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2014; Takeuchi et al. 2014 ; Tran and 
Kannan 2015 ; Bu et al. 2016; Luon go et al. 2016; Tran  et al. 2017; Wei et al. 2017;  
Giovano ulis et al. 2018 ). The median ( 2.8 ng/m3) and maximum ( 65.9 ng/m3) 
concentrations from the Canadian  study ( Health Canada 2017 ) were used to estimate 
the general population daily intake of BBP from indoor air (Appendix D, Table D-1a). 
BBP w as surveyed in the Canadian House Dust Study (CHDS) and was detected in 
100% of 126 homes  sampled across Canada  (range: 0.6 to 944 µg/g, median: 42.3 
µg/g, 95 th percentile: 512 µg/g) (Kubwabo et al. 2013). In addition, BBP was measured 
in dust sampled from  Canadian homes in Ottawa and Toronto , ON, Canada  (detected in 
100% of 51 homes , range: 0.72 -1175  µg/g, median: 6.45 µg/g, mean : 27.6 µg/g; Health 
Canada. 2017 ). Internationally, BBP has also been reported in house dust (Fromme et 
al. 2004; Bornehag et al.  2005; Kolarik et al. 2008; Langer et al. 2010; Bergh et al. 
2011a; Guo and Kannan  2011; Hsu et al. 2012; Kang et al. 2012; Gevao et al. 2013; 
Orecchio et al. 2013; Papadopoulos et al. 2013; Blanchard et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2014; 
Dodson et al. 2015; Luong o and Östman 2015 ; Bu et al. 2016;  He et al. 2016; Luongo 
et al. 2016; Subedi et al. 2017;  Tran et al. 2 016; Muenhor  et al. 2 018; Giovanoulis et al. 
2018 ).     
The CHDS  (Kubwabo et al. 2013) was identified as the key study for exposure 
characterization,  since it was representative of homes across Canada. The  median 
(42.3 µg/g) and 95th percentile (512 µg/g) concentrations were used to estimate the 
Canadian general population daily intake of BBP from dust (Appendix D, Table D -1a). 
BBP has applications as a plasticizer in the manufacturing of automobiles and 
automobile parts (ECHA 2012; Environment Canada 2014). For the general population, 
indirect exposure (e.g., off -gassing) is considered a relevant source . Tran et al (2007)  
and Chi et al (2017)  reported BBP  as being present  in air in vehicles in Vietnam (range:  
49 3.59 to 121 ng/m3, media n: 5.2 ng/m3, mean: 31 ng/m3) and China (mean: 3401 ng/m3), 
respectively.  Albar et al. (2017) reported BBP in dust (range: 0.23 -19.5 ug/g) from 
vehicles.  However,  no Canadian data on this exposure source has been identified, 
which is currently an uncertainty in the screening assessment.  
Food, infant formula and breast milk  
In Canada, BBP presence in food was measured in samples from the 2013 Canadian 
TDS (Cao et al.  2015). BBP was detected in 32 of 159 food composite samples 
(average MDL = 3.10 ng/g) , with a mean concentration of 12.4 ng/g and a range of 1.86 
to 82.7 ng/g (Cao et al. 2015). Milk, soft drinks , and fruit juice are the major sources of 
intake for all po pulation groups. In addition, BBP presence in food was monitored as 
part of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s (CFIA) 2013 -2014 and 2014 -2015 Food 
Safety Action Plan (FSAP) surveys ( personal communication from the FD, HC, to 
ESRAB,  HC, April 2014 ; unref erenced ). BBP was detected in less than 1% of 1518 
(LOD: 0.1 µg/g) packaged and processed food samples at concentrations ranging from 
0.3 to 1.9 µg/g , with a mean of the positive samples of 0.75 µg/g.  Internationally, BBP 
has been detected  in food and beverages (Sajid et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016; Yang et al. 
2017; Giovanoulis et al. 2018).  
Additionally, breast milk was monitored as part of the MIREC study. BBP was not 
detected in any samples (n=305; MDL=0.00741 µg/g; personal communication  from the 
FD, HC, to ESRAB, HC, October 2014 ; unreferenced ). Internationally, BBP was 
detected in breast milk from one study in Sweden (Högberg et al. 2008) and not 
detected in another study in Germany (Fromme et al. 2011). However, BBP readily 
metabolizes  to MBzP in the human body (Koch and Calafat 2009; Frederiksen et al. 
2011) , and as a result , BBP, as the parent compound, may not be found in breast milk 
in high quantities.  
MBzP  was measured in breast milk as part of the P4 study (n = 56 breast milk samp les 
collected from study participants). It was detected in 34% of breast milk samples, with  
the median  value reported as below the LOD (0.018 µg/L)  and the maximum value 
reported as 0.16 µg/L ( Arbuckle et al. 2016, Table S3 ). Internationally, MBzP has been  
detected in breast milk (Mortensen et al. 2005; Högberg et al. 2008).  
In the P4 study, MBzP was detected in <5% of samples of infant formula (n=23; 
LOD=0.018 µg/L) ( Arbuckle et al. 2016, Table S3 ). The CFIA surveillance data from the 
2013 -2014 and 2014 -2015 FSAP surveys did not detect  BBP (LOD= 0.1 µg/g) in any 
samples of infant foods (n=44), infant formula (n=59) or infant cereals (n=19). 
Internationally, BBP was  reported  to be present  in various baby foods in Italy (Russo et 
al. 2016); however, it was  not detected in infant formulas in two European studies 
(Sørensen 2006; Bradley et al. 2013a).  
Using Canadian TDS data, probabilistic estimates of dietary intakes were derived for 
BBP and results are outlined in Appendix D, Table D-1b (for methodology for  estimating 
probabilistic intakes, see Appendix E). Results for BBP in breast milk and infant formula  
50 that were below the LOD (i.e., 0.018 µg/L) were set to half the LOD (Appendix D, Table 
D-1a). 
Ambient air, drinking water and soil  
No recent Canadian data were identified for BBP in ambient air. Rudel et al. (2010) 
measured outdoor air outside homes in the United States (detected in 5% of 43 
samples [method reporting limit = 6 ng/m3], median: not reported, maximum: 8.5 ng/m3). 
Internationally, BBP has been reported in ambient air (Li and Wang 2015). Rudel et al. 
(2010) was identified as the relevant study for exposure characterization (sampling from 
North America), and half the method reporting limit (method reporting limit [MRL]  = 6 
ng/m3) and maximum (8.5 ng/m3) concentrations were used to estimate potential 
exposures to BBP via ambient air (Appendix D, Table D-1a).  
No Canadian data were identified for BBP in drinking water. BBP was analyzed for, but 
not detected in , Canadian bottled water (MD L: 0.085 µg/L; Cao 2008). Similarly, BBP 
was not detected in any samples of well water intended to be bottled in Spain (Bono -
Blay et al. 2012). Internationally, BBP has been detected in bottled water (Jeddi et al. 
2015, Lv et al. 2015 ; Pourzamani et al. 20 17), drinking water (Liu et al. 2015),  mineral 
and soda water (Yang et al.2017)  and surface waters (Net et al. 2015, Selvaraj et al. 
2015 ; Niu et al. 2018 ). It was not detected in any samples of tap water or river water in 
Spain (Dominguez -Morueco et al. 2014)  or in bottled water in Egypt (Zaki et al. 2018) . 
In the absence of Canadian or North American data on levels of BBP in tap water, half 
the MDL (i.e., 0.085 µg/L) for BBP in bottled water was used to estimate the general 
population daily intake from d rinking water (Cao et al. 2008) in Canada (Appendix D, 
Table D-1a). 
Khosravi and Price (2015) reported various phthalates in agricultural soils in both 
control and biosolid amended soils collected in Nova Scotia, Canada. BBP was reported 
at 0.13 ng/g (cont rol soil) and 2.4 ng/g (biosolid amended soil) (Khosravi and Price 
2015). Internationally, BBP has been detected in soils (Cheng et al. 2015; Tran et al. 
2015; Wang et al. 2015 ; Li et al. 2016; Skrbic et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 
2018 ). Conve rsely, Hongjun et al. (2014) did not detect BBP in any samples of urban, 
suburban or rural soils in China. The reported concentration of BBP in control 
agricultural soils (0.13 ng/g; Khosravi and Price 2015) was used to estimate potential 
exposures to BBP via soil in Canada (Appendix D, Table D-1a).

Globally, BBP may also be present in a wide variety of manufactured items, including 
childcare articles, children’s toys, do -it-yourself (DIY) products, paints , household 
residual  waste plastic , and exercise balls ( HPD 1993 - ; ECHA 2012; Korfali et al. 2013;  
AGDH  2015 ; Pvinenko et al. 2016 ). In Canada, BBP has also been reported as a 
plasticizer used in various types of manufactured items (NRC 2012; See Table 2 -2; 
Environment Canad a 2014).    
51 Toys and childcare articles  
Health Canada has surveyed soft vinyl toys and childcare articles over a number of 
years for multiple phthalates, including BBP, and it was detected in only one sample 
from the 2008 survey (below the restricted limit)  and has not been detected since 
(Health Canada 2007, 2009, 2012, 2014 , 2018 a). BBP was also monitored in toys 
purchased in Canada, but made elsewhere; it was detected at 0.001 % to 0.02% 
(Stringer et al. 2000). Internationally, BBP was monitored in toys in  India  (3 of 24 toy 
samples, all at <0.1%; Johnson et al. 2011)  and in New Zealand (0.01 -0.031%; 
Ashworth et al. 2018) . . 
Currently, Canada ( like the United States and the European Union ) has regulations in 
place limiting the amount of certain phthalates ( including BBP) in toys and childcare 
articles ( Phthalates Regulations  under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act  
[Canada 2016] ). In Europe, results from the 2016 enforcement project (ECHA 2018) 
indicated that phthalates had one of the highest non -complia nt rates, with 20% of toys in 
violation of REACH Annex XV11 entry 51 (DEHP, DBP, BBP; ECHA 2018). The United 
States Consumer Product Safety Com mission (US CPSC) recently stated that less than 
10% of exposures to BBP for infants and children would result from mouthing of toys 
and childcare articles (US CPSC CHAP 2014).  
Given the regulations in place for BBP in toys and childcare articles in Canada  and the 
lack of detection of  BBP in toys and childcare articles reported in Canadian monitoring 
studies  since 2008 , exposure is expected to be negligible and oral intakes from 
mouthing toys and/or childcare articles were not estimated.   
Personal care pro ducts  
On the basis of notifications submitted under the Cosmetic Regulations,  BBP is not 
expected to be present in cosmetics in Canada (personal communication from the 
CPSD , HC, to ESRAB, HC, July 2015 ; unreferenced ). Internationally, BBP has been 
detected  in various types of personal care products10 (Guo and Kannan 2013; Guo et al. 
2013; Bao et al. 2015).  In contrast , Liang et al. (2013) did not detect BBP in cosmetics 
in China. This presence may be due to potential migration from packaging. A summary 
of recent studies measuring concentrations of BBP in personal care products reported 
in North America is outlined in Table 9-2.  
                                            
10 For the purpose of this document, a personal care product is defined as a substance or mixture of 
substances , in a product, that  is generally recognized by the public for use in daily cleansing or grooming. 
Depen ding on how the product is represented for sale and its composition, personal care products may 
fall into one of three regulatory categories in Canada , cosmetics, drugs or natural health products.

BBP was not reported as used in Canada . The United States  reported low detection 
frequencies (5 % to 13%), and the majority of the concentrations in all studies were in 
the sub -ppm range . Exposure to BBP from personal care products is therefore not 
considered significant. In addition, NICNAS ( AGDH 2015) and US CPSC CHAP (2014) 
reported that the cosmetic use of BBP is likely to be rare  and they did not assess 
exposure from this source. For that reason , exposure estimates from this source were 
not generated.  
Other products available to  consumers  
Globally, BBP may be found in paint products (US CPSC CHAP 2014; AGDH  2015). 
This use has also been rep orted in Canada (Environment Canada 2014). The US CPSC 
CHAP (2014) reported that aerosol paints may contribute to >10% of exposure to BBP 
for adults, infants, toddlers and children.   
In addition, BBP may have applications in the production of articles tha t may come in 
contact with skin (ECHA 2012; AGDH  2015). However, BBP was reported in only 1 of 
35 samples of children’s clothing (Brigden et al. 2013)  and in less than 35% of samples 
of jeans and dermal wipes that account for subsequent rub -off to legs in adults in China 
(Gong et al. 201 6). However, Saini et al. (2016) detected BBP in cotton and polyester 
fabrics (>90% detection) purchased in the United States.  The US CPSC CHAP (2014) 
did not evaluate dermal exposure to items containing BBP.   
However, since exposure to BBP from these uses is considered to be c aptured  by the 
available Canadian biomonitoring data estimates of exposure were not calculated . 
DBP  
Biomonitoring  
Mono -n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), the major monoester metabolite of DBP, was 
monitored in the CHMS Cycle 1 (2007 -2009 ; n = 3235, 6 -49 years ) and Cycle 2 (2009 -
2011 ; n = 2555, ages 3 -79 years ) with 99% detection in all samples (Health Canada 
2011b, 2013). Additionally, MnBP was measured as part of the First Nations 
Biomonitoring Initiative  (n=492 for on -reserve and Crown -land population s aged 20  
53 years and over). Urine concentrations for MnBP (geometric mean) were reported to be 
similar in FNBI sample s to those reported  in the CHMS  Cycle 1 for population aged 20 
years and older (AFN 2013).   
MnBP was also monitored by Health Canada in three cohort studies : P4, MIREC and 
the MIREC -CD Plus. All three studies  reported high detection frequencies of MnBP 
(100%, 99% and 100%, respectively; Arbuckle et al. 2016, Table S3; Arbuckle et al. 
2014;  personal communication from EHSRD , HC, to ESRAB, HC, October 2013, 2014 , 
unreferenced ). An additional metabolite of DBP (MHBP) was also monitored and 
detected at high frequency (92 % and 100%, respectively) in the P4 and MIREC -CD 
Plus studies (personal communication  from EHSRD , HC, to ESRAB, HC, October 2013, 
2014 ; unreferenced ). 
Using the CHMS  (Cycle 2) , P4, MIREC and MIREC -CD Plus datasets, reverse 
dosimetry intake estimates were generated  as previously described . Biomonitoring 
intakes are presented in Table 9-3 below (see Appendix C for further information on the 
methodology).

c n = 31 women, 542 individual spot samples, women provided multiple urine samples over two visits.  
The highest exposed group according to biomonitoring data (all sources, CHMS) is 
children aged 3 to 5 years, with median and 95 th percentile intakes of 1.7 and 5.3 µg/kg 
bw/day, respectively. For older populations, the highest exposed group (all sources, P4) 
is pregnant women ( aged 19 years and over ), with median and 95 th percentile intakes 
of 0.55 and 4.1 1 µg/kg bw/day, respectively.  
Environmental media and food  
The subpopulation with the highest exposure to DBP from environmental media and 
food consisted of children ( aged 0.5 to 4 y ears), with total daily intakes of 0.88 and 2.96 
µg/kg bw/day estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding 
concentrations, respectively (Appendix D, Table D-2a).  
Indoor air and dust  
DBP was measured in indoor air in Canadian homes in Ottawa and Toronto ( detected in 
100% of 51 homes , range: 15.6 -885 ng/m3, median: 105 ng/m3, mean : 155 ng/m3; 
Health Canada. 2017 ). Another  study measured DBP in indoor air in 75 Canadian 
homes ( median:  200 ng/m3, range : 130- 1100 ng/m3;Zhu et al. 2007). DBP has also 
been measured in indoor air in homes in the United States  and internationally 
(Blanchard et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2014; Takeuchi et al. 2014 ; Tran and Kannan 2015 ; Bu 
et al. 2016; Luongo et al. 2016; Tran et al. 2017; Wei et al. 2017; Giovanoulis et al. 
2018 ). The higher Canadian indoor air concentr ations  from Zhu et al. (2007)  (median: 
200 ng/m3 and maximum:  1100 ng/m3) were conservatively used to estimate the 
general population daily intake of DBP from indoor air in Canada (Appendix D, Table D-
2a). 
DBP was surveyed in the CHDS and was detected in 9 9% of 126 homes  sampled 
across Canada  (range: ND –1392  µg/g, median: 16.8 µg/g, 95 th percentile: 95.4 µg/g; 
Kubwabo et al. 2013). In addition, DBP was measured in dust sampled from Canadian 
homes in Ottawa and Toronto, ON, Canada ( detected in 100% of 51 homes, range: 1.9 -
872 µg/g, median: 8.8 µg/g, mean : 50.6 µg/g; Health Canada. 2017 ). Internationally, 
DBP has also been reported in house dust (Dodson et al. 2015; Luongo and Östman 
2015 ; Bu et al. 2016; He et al. 2016; Luongo et al. 2016; Subedi et al. 2017;  Giovanoulis 
et al. 2018 ).   
55 The CHDS  (Kubwabo et al. 2013) was identified as the key study for exposure 
characterization , since it was representative of homes across Canada. The  median 
(16.8 µg/g) and 95th percentile (95.4 µg/g) concentrations were used to  estimate the 
Canadian general population daily intake of DBP from dust (Appendix D, Table D -2a). 
DBP has applications as a plasticizer in the manufacturing of automobiles and 
automobile parts (ECHA 2012; AGDH 2013 a). For the general population, indirect 
exposure (e.g., off -gassing) is considered a relevant source . Tran et al (2007) and Chi 
et al (2017) reported DBP to be present in air in vehicles in Vietnam (range: 2.22 to 145 
ng/m3, median 46.7 ng/m3, mean: 57.1 ng/m3) and China (mean: 2690 ng/m3), 
respec tively. Albar et al. (2017) reported DBP in dust (range: 0.49 -50 µg/g) from 
vehicles. However,  no Canadian data on this exposure source has been identified, 
which is currently an uncertainty in the screening assessment.  
Food, infant formula and breast milk  
In Canada, DBP presence in food was monitored in samples from the 2013 Canadian 
TDS (Cao et al. 2015). DBP was detected in 44 of 159 food composite samples 
(average MDL=16.6 ng/g) with a mean concentration of the positive samples of 23.2 
ng/g and a range of 6.21 – 208 ng/g (Cao et al. 2015). Milk, soft drinks, bread, and ice 
cream are the major sources of intake for the overall population. In addition, DBP 
presence in food was monitored as part of the CFIA 2013 -2014 and 2014 -2015 FSAP 
surveys ( personal communication from the FD, HC, to ESRAB, HC, April 2014 ; 
unreferenced ). DBP was detected in 14% of 1518 (LOD: 0.1 µg/g) packaged and 
processed food samples. DBP concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 4.3 µg/g with a mean 
concentration of the positive s amples of 0.76 µg/g.  Internationally, DBP has been 
detected  in food and beverages (Sajid et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2017; 
Giovanoulis et al. 2018).   
MnBP  was measured in breast milk as part of the P4 study (n = 31 women, 56 breast 
milk sample s collected from study participants, LOD=0.057 µg/L). It was detected in 
100% of breast milk samples, with median and maximum values reported as 0.656 and 
5.18 µg/L, respectively (personal communication from EHSRD , HC, to ESRAB, HC, 
October 2013 ; unreferen ced). Internationally, MnBP has been measured in breast milk 
in Europe (Fromme et al. 2011).  
Breast milk was also monitored as part of the MIREC study. DBP was detected in 21 
samples (n=305, median=0.0129 µg/g, range= <MDL -0.030 µg/g, MDL=0.0149 µg/g; 
personal communication from FD, HC, to ESRAB, HC, October 2014 ; unreferenced ). 
Internationally, DBP was detected in breast milk from one study in Sweden (Högberg et 
al. 2008) and Germany (Fromme et al. 2011). However, DBP readily metabolizes to 
MnBP in the hum an body (Koch and Calafat 2009) and would therefore not be expected 
in breast milk in high frequency.   
Recently, an analysis of 23 infant formula samples in the P4 study showed 80% 
detection of MnBP (LOD: 0.057 µg/L, median: 0.299 µg/L, maximum: 1.16 µg/L)  
56 (Arbuckle et al. 2016, Table S3 ). However, measurement of this metabolite in infant 
formula was affected by high field blank levels (possible contamination ; Arbuckle et al. 
2016, Table S3 ); and therefore, was not used to quantify intakes. The CFIA sur veillance 
data did detect DBP in 3 samples of infant foods (n=20, median: ND, 95 th percentile: 
0.675 µg/g), 12 samples of infant formula (n=32, median: ND, 95 th percentile: 1.12 
µg/g) and 4 samples of infant cereals (n=7, median: 0.42 µg/g, 95 th percentile : 1.79 
µg/g; personal communication from the FD, HC, to ESRAB, HC, April 2014 ; 
unreferenced ). Internationally, DBP has been reported  to be present  in various baby 
foods in Italy (Russo et al. 2016) and  in infant formulas in Italy and Europe (Cirillo et al.  
2015), but not in the United Kingdom (Bradley et al. 2013a).     
Using TDS data, probabilistic estimates of dietary intakes for DBP were derived for the 
Canadian general population and results are outlined in Appendix B, Table B -2b (the 
methodology for est imating probabilistic intakes is provided in Appendix E). Median 
(0.656 µg/L) and maximum (5.18 µg/L) values of MnBP (metabolite of DBP) in breast 
milk measured in the P4 study was used for risk characterization (Appendix D, Table D-
2a).   
Ambient air, drinking water and soil  
No recent Canadian data were identified for DBP in ambient air. Rudel et al. (2010) 
measured outdoor air outside homes in the United States (detected in 35% of 43 
samples [MRL = 7 ng/m3], maximum: 32 ng/m3).  Internationally, DBP has been 
reported in ambient air (Li and Wang 2015). Rudel et al. (2010) was identified as the 
relevant study for exposure characterization (sampling from North America), and half 
the MRL (7 ng/m3) and maximum (32 ng/m3) concentrations were used to estimat e 
potential exposures to DBP via ambient air (Appendix D, Table D-2a). 
No Canadian data were identified for DBP in drinking water. In Canada, Cao et al. 
(2008) surveyed phthalates in bottled carbonated and non -carbonated water and 
detected and quantified D BP in all 11 samples (range: 0.075 – 1.72 µg/L). 
Internationally, DBP was also detected in bottled water samples (Jeddi et al. 2015; Lv et 
al. 2015 ; Pourzamani et al. 201 7; Zaki et al. 2018 ), mineral and soda water (Yang et 
al.2017), surface waters (Li et al. 2015; Net et al. 2015; Selvaraj et al. 2015 ; Martins et 
al. 2016; Li et al. 2017; Ji et al. 2018 ), and tap water (Liu et al. 2015). In the absence of 
Canadian and North American data on levels of DBP in tap water, mean (0.357 µg/L) 
and maximum (1.72 µg /L) concentrations of DBP in bottled non -carbonated water were 
used to estimate the general population daily intake from drinking water (Cao et al. 
2008) in Canada (Appendix D, Table D-2a).  
Khosravi and Price (2015) reported various phthalates in agricult ural soils in both 
control and biosolid amended soils collected in Nova Scotia, Canada. DBP was 
reported at 0.14 ng/g (control soil) and 1.1 ng/g (biosolid amended) (Khosravi and Price 
2015). Internationally, DBP has been detected in soils (Cheng et al. 20 15; Tran et al. 
2015; Wang et al. 2015). The reported concentration of DBP in control agricultural soils  
57 (0.14 ng/g; Khosravi and Price 2015) was used to estimate potential exposures to DBP 
via soil in Canada (Appendix D, Table D-2a). 
Products available to  consumers  
Globally, DBP may also be present in a wide variety of manufactured items, including 
childcare articles, children’s toys, DIY products, gloves , household residual waste 
plastic  and exercise balls ( HPD 1993 - ; Stringer et al. 2000; ECHA 2012; Chao  et al. 
2013; Korfali et al. 2013; AGDH  2013 a; Pvinenko et al. 2016 ). In Canada, DBP has also 
been reported as a plasticizer used in various types of manufactured items (NRC 2012; 
See Table 2 -2; Environment Canada 2014).   
Toys and childcare articles  
Numerous studies have examined the concentrations of DBP in childcare articles and 
toys (Stringer et al. 2000; Biedermann -Brem et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2011; Korfali et 
al. 2013 ; Ashworth et al. 2018 ). A summary of DBP reported in toys and childcare 
articles available in Canada are presented in Table 9-4.

Currently, Canada ( like the United States  and the European Union ) has regulations in 
place limiting the amount of certain phthalates (including DBP) in toys and childcare 
articles ( Phthalates Regulations  under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act  
[Canada 2016] ). In Europe,  results from the 2016 enforcement project (ECHA 2018) 
indicated that phthalates had one of the highest non -compliant rates, with 20% of toys in 
violation of REACH Annex XV11 entry 51 (DEHP, DBP, BBP; ECHA 2018). The US 
CPSC recently stated that less than 10% of exposures to DBP for infants and children 
would result from mouthing of toys and childcare articles (US CPSC CHAP 2014).     
Given the regulations in place for DBP in toys and childcare articles in Canada and the 
lack of detection of DBP in toys and  childcare articles reported in Canadian monitoring  
58 studies  from 2014 onwards , exposure is expected to be negligible and oral intakes from 
mouthing toys and/or childcare articles were not estimated.  
Personal care products  
On the basis of notifications submitted under the Cosmetic Regulations,  DBP is likely to 
be present in cosmetics in Canada, specifically nail polishes (personal communication 
from the CPSD , HC, to ESRAB, HC, July 2015 ; unreferenced ).   
 
Koniecki et al . (2011) reported DBP  in cosmetics purchased in Canada, including hair 
sprays, mousses, nail polishes, skin cleansers and baby shampoos. Internationally, 
DBP has been detected in various types of personal care products (Guo and Kannan 
2013; Guo et al. 2013; Liang et al. 2013).  A summary of recent studies measuring 
concentrations of DBP in personal care products reported in North America is outlined 
in Table 9-5.

a Limits of detection: Koniecki et al. 2011 (0.1 µg/g), Guo and Kannan 2013 (0.01 µg/g)  
Given that the North American studies report that detection frequencies are low (2 % to 
8% in Canada, 17  to 39% in US) and the majority of the concentrations in all three 
studies are in the sub -ppm range, exposure from personal care products are not 
considered significant. The exception is nail polishes , as both North American studies 
showed high concentrations of DBP in nail pol ishes (Koniecki et al. 2011 and Guo and 
Kannan 2013). In addition, the US CPSC CHAP (2014) indicated that nail polish as a 
product type would likely contribute to >10% of exposure to DBP , and NICNAS ( AGDH 
2013 a) reported that this type of product was most likely to contain the highest amount 
of DBP. Therefore, estimates of dermal exposure from nail polishes as a worst -case 
representative scenario are presented in Table 9-6.

Estimates of exposure to DBP from nail polishes were 0.16 and 0.83 µg/kg bw/day for 
mean and maximum concentrations, respectively.   
Other products available to  consumers  
Globally, DBP ma y be found in paint products ( AGDH 2013 a). This use has also been 
reported in Canada (Environment Canada 2014). In addition, DBP may have 
applications in the production of articles that may come in contact with skin (ECHA 
2012; AGDH 2013 a; Environment Canada 2014). DBP was reported in 23 of 35 
samples (<3.0 -120 mg/kg) of children’s clothing (Brigden et al. 2013) . It was also 
reported  to be present  in jeans and to subsequent ly rub-off to legs  (as measured via 
dermal wipes)  in adults in Chin a (Gong et al. 201 6) and to be present  in cotton and 
polyester fabrics (>90% detection) purchased in the United States (Saini et al. 2016) . 
DBP is also found as a non -medicinal ingredient in 1 topical licensed natural health 
product in Canada (LNHPD modifi ed 2018 ). It has also been reported in traditional 
medicines in China and Western medicines in the United States (Jia et al. 2017).  The 
US CPSC CHAP (2014) did not evaluate dermal exposure to items containing DBP.    
Exposure to DBP from these uses is considered to be captured by the available 
Canadian biomonitoring data, therefore estimates of exposure were not calculated.  
DEHP  
Biomonitoring  
Several metabolites of DEHP11 were monitored in the CHMS Cycle 1 (2007 –2009 , 6-49 
years, n = 3235, MEHP MEOHP, ME HHP ) and Cycle 2 (2009 -2011 , 3-79 years, n = 
2498, MEHP, n = 2562, MEOHP, n = 2561, MEHHP ) with >99% detection in all samples 
(Health Canada 2011b, 2013). Additionally, these metabolites were measured as part of 
the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative  (n=492 for on -reserve and Crown -land 
population s aged 20 years and over). Urine concentrations for MEHP, MEHHP and 
MEOHP (geometric means) were all reported to be statistically lower in FNBI samples 
than those  reported in CHMS Cycle 1 for population aged 20  years and older (AFN 
2013).   
Metabolites of DEHP were also monitored by Health Canada in three cohort studies : P4 
study (monitored 5 metabolites of DEHP12; Arbuckle et al. 2016, Table S3 ), MIREC

60 study (monitored 3 metabolites of DEHP13; Arbuckle et al. 201 4) and the MIREC -CD 
Plus study (monitored 5 metabolites of DEHP14; personal communication from EHSRD, 
HC, to ESRAB, HC, October 2013, 2014, unreferenced ). All th ree surveys reported high 
detection frequencies (> 90%) of all metabolites.  
Using the CHMS  (Cycl e 2), P4, MIREC and MIREC -CD Plus datasets, reverse 
dosimetry intake estimates were generated  as previously described . Biomonitoring 
intakes are presented in Table 9-7 below (see Appendix C for further information on the 
methodology).

61 c n = 31 pregnant women, 542 individual spot samples, women provided multiple urine samples over two visits.  
The highest exposed group based on biomonitoring data (all sources, CHMS) is 
children aged 3 to 5 year s, with median and 95 th percentile intakes of 4.0 and 12 µg/kg 
bw/day, respectively. For older population s (19 years and over ), the highest exposed 
group (all sources, MIREC) is pregnant females aged 18 year s and over, with median 
and 95 th percentile intakes of 1.6 and 8.4  µg/kg bw/day, respectively. However, the 
higher exposure estimates for pregnant women r elative to non -pregnant women could 
be a result of multiple factors (different populations sampled, different sample sizes, 
etc.) as the results were obtained from different studies. Therefore a correlation 
between pregnancy and higher DEHP levels cannot b e made.  
Environmental media and food  
The subpopulation with the highest exposure to DEHP from environmental media and 
food consisted of children ( aged 0.5 to 4 y ears), with total daily intakes of 10.45 and 
27.57 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding 
concentrations, respectively (Appendix D, Table D-3a).    
Indoor air and dust  
DEHP was measured in indoor air in Canadian homes in Ottawa and Toronto ( detected 
in 100% of 51 homes , range: 5.55 -1409 ng/m3, median: 30.4 ng/m3, mean : 148 ng/m3; 
Health Canada 2017 ). Another  study measured DEHP in indoor air in 75 Canadian 
homes (median:  88 ng/m3, range : 8.8-2100 ng/m3; Zhu et al. 2007).  DEHP has also 
been measured in indoor air in homes in the United States  and internationa lly 
(Blanchard et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2014; Takeuchi et al. 2014 ; Tran and Kannan 2015 ; Bu 
et al. 2016; Luongo et al. 2016; Tran et al. 2017; Wei et al. 2017; Martine z et al. 2018; 
Giovanoulis et al. 2018 ). The higher Canadian indoor air concentrations  from Zhu et al. 
(2007)  (median: 88 ng/m3 and maximum: 2100 ng/m3) were conservatively used to 
estimate the general population daily intake of DEHP from indoor air in Canada 
(Appendix D, Table D-3a). 
DEHP was surveyed in the CHDS and was detected in 100% o f 126 homes  sampled 
across Canada  (range: 35.9 –3836  µg/g, median: 462 µg/g, 95 th percentile: 1880 µg/g) 
(Kubwabo et al. 2013). In addition, DEHP was measured in dust sampled from 
Canadian homes in Ottawa and Toronto, ON, Canada ( detected in 100% of 51 homes, 
range: 69-2070  µg/g, median: 218 µg/g, mean : 282 µg/g; Health Canada. 2017 ). 
Internationally, DEHP has also been reported  to be present  in house dust (Dodson et al. 
2015; Luongo and Östman 2015 ; Bu et al. 2016; He et al. 2016; Luongo et al. 2016; 
Tran et al. 2016; Subedi et al. 2017 ).  
The CHDS  (Kubwabo et al. 2013) was identified as the key study for exposure 
characterization,  since it was representative of homes across Canada. The  median (462 
µg/g) and 95th percentile (1880 µg/g) concentrations were used to estimate the  
62 Canadian general population daily intake of D EHP from dust in Canada (Appendix D, 
Table D -3a). 
 
DEHP has applications as a plasticizer in the manufacturing of automobiles and 
automobile parts ( AGDH  2010; ECHA 2012; Environment Canada 2014a). For the 
general population, indirect exposure (e.g., off -gassing) is considered a relevant source . 
Tran et al (2007) and Chi et al (2017) reported DEHP  as being present  in air in vehicles 
in Vietnam (range: 81 to 670 ng/m3, median 241 ng/m3, mean: 313 ng/m3) and China 
(mean: 5289 ng/m3), respectively. Albar et al. (2017) reported DEHP in dust (range: 62 -
2446 µg/g) from vehicles. However,  no Canadian  data on this exposure source has 
been identifi ed, which is currently an uncertainty in the screening assessment.  
 
Food, infant formula and breast milk  
In Canada, DEHP presence in food was measured in samples from the 2013 Canadian 
TDS (Cao et al. 2015). DEHP was detected in 111 of 159 food composite s amples 
(average MDL=39.0 ng/g) with a range of concentrations from 14.4 to 714 ng/g (Cao et 
al. 2015). Milk, fruit s and vegetables are the major sources of intake for all population 
groups over 1 year of age. Infant formula is the major source of intake fo r infants under 
the age of 1 year.   
Regarding fruits and vegetables, detectable levels of DEHP (i.e., concentrations above 
the LOD) were found in most of the composite samples (Cao et al. 2015). The source of 
DEHP in fruit and vegetable samples is unclear, but could be linked to their packaging. 
For example, some fruits or vegetables may have been packaged in plastic. 
Furthermore , certain composite samples included canned or jarred products where 
coatings and gaskets on jar lids may be potential sources of DEHP in foods. 
Environmental contamination and agricultural practices are other possible contributors 
to DEHP residues in fruit s and vegetables. Nonetheless, the DEHP results for 
composite fruit and vegetable samples from the 2013 TDS are considered unusual and 
unlikely to represent the frequency and magnitude of DEHP concentrations that are 
typically found in these types of foods  (personal communication from FD, HC, to 
ESRAB, HC, April 2016 ; unreferenced ). Health Canada’s FD also analyzed composite 
fruit and vegetable samples from the 2014 TDS in order to further understand the 
distribution of DEHP concentrations in fruits and veg etables sold in Canada .15 Relative 
to the 2013 TDS data, the 2014 TDS results detected DEHP approximately twofold less 
frequently in fruit and vegetable composite samples (68% in 2013 versus 30% in 2014). 
In addition, the mean concentrations in positive sam ples from 2014 are more than 5 
                                            
15 The 2014 TDS data were not available at the time that the dietary exposure estimates that are 
presented in this report were generated.   
63 times lower than those from the 2013 TDS samples (61 µg/kg in the 2014 versus 331 
µg/kg in 2013). Therefore, the dietary exposures estimates presented herein, which are 
based only on the 2013 TDS results, are expected to over estimate actual dietary 
exposure to DEHP (personal communication from FD, HC, to ESRAB, HC, April 2016 ; 
unreferenced ). 
DEHP presence in food was also monitored as part of the CFIA 2013 -2014 and 2014 -
2015 FSAP surveys ( personal communication from FD, HC, to ESRAB, HC, April 2014 ; 
unreferenced ). DEHP was detected in 8% of 1518 (LOD: 0.05 µg/g) packaged and 
processed food samples. DEHP concentrations ranged from 0.27 to 76.2 µg/g , with a 
mean of the samples of 2.09 µg/g.  Internationally, DEHP has been detec ted in food and 
beverages (Sajid et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2017; Giovanoulis et al. 2018).   
Breast milk was monitored as part of the MIREC study. DEHP was detected in 23 
samples (n=305, mean of positives=0.0977 µg/g, range= <MDL -0.236 µg/g, average 
MDL=0.0668 µg/g; personal communication from FD, HC, to ESRAB, HC, October 
2014 ; unreferenced ). Internationally, DEHP has been detected in breast milk in Sweden 
(Högberg et al. 2008) and Germany (Fromme et al. 2011) , but was not detected in Italy 
(Guerranti et al. 2013). However, DEHP readily metabolizes to multiple metabolites in 
the human body (Koch and Calafat 2009) and would therefore not be expected to be 
found in breast milk in high quantities.  
Three metabolites of DEHP16  were measured in brea st milk as part of the P4 study (n = 
56 breast milk samples collected from study participants). MEHP, MEHHP and MEOHP 
were detected in 100, 16 and 8% of breast milk samples, respectively ( Arbuckle et al. 
2016, Table S3 ). LODs were reported to be 0.1, 0.019  and 0.017 µg/L, respectively. The 
median and maximum reported levels of MEHP were 1.26 and 17.05 µg/L, respectively 
(Arbuckle et al. 2016, Table S3 ).  Internationally, MEHP has also been detected in 
breast milk in Europe (Mortensen et al. 2005; Högberg et  al. 2008; Fromme et al. 2011; 
Guerranti et al. 2013).     
Recently, an analysis of 23 infant formula samples in the P4 study showed 90% 
detection of MEHP (LOD: 0.1 µg/L) and 8% detection of MEHHP (LOD: 0.019 µg/L). 
Median and maximum values of MEHP were r eported as 0.469 and 2.154 µg/L, 
respectively. MEOHP was not detected (LOD: 0.017 µg/L) ( Arbuckle et al. 2016, Table 
S3). However, measurement of these metabolites in infant formula was affected by high 
field blank levels (possible contamination ; Arbuckle et al. 2016, Table S 2) and therefore 
was not used to quantify intakes. The CFIA surveillance data did detect DEHP in 1 
sample of infant cereal (n=7). It was not detected in any samples of infant formula 
(n=32) or infant foods (n=20) ( personal communication  from FD, HC, to ESRAB, HC, 
April 2014 ; unreferenced ). Internationally, DEHP has been reported  to be present  in 
                                            
16 MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP   
64 various baby foods in Italy (Russo et al. 2016) and  in infant formulas in Italy, the UK and 
Europe (Sørensen 2006; Bradley et al. 2013a; Cirillo  et al. 2015).  
Using TDS data, probabilistic estimates of dietary intakes for DEHP were derived for the 
Canadian general population . The results are outlined in Appendix D, Table D-3b and 
the methodology for estimating probabilistic intakes is provided in Appendix E. Median 
(1.26 µg/L) and maximum (17.05 µg/L) values of MEHP (metabolite of DEHP) in breast 
milk measured in the P4 study were used for exposure characterization (Appendix D, 
Table D-3a). Note that exposure estimates based on food intake are significantly higher 
than those based on bio monitoring results (see Table 9 -7 and Table D -3b). This is 
expected to be due to detection of frequent and elevated concentrations of DEHP in 
highly consumed foods from the 2013 TDS , such as certain fruits and ve getables, as 
previously discussed.  
Ambient air, drinking water and soil  
No Canadian data were identified for DEHP in ambient air. Internationally, DEHP has 
been reported in outdoor air (Li and Wang 2015). Rudel et al. (2010) measured outdoor 
air outside homes in the United States  (detected in 14% of 43 samples [MRL= 40 
ng/m3], median: not reported, maximum: 230 ng/m3). Rudel et al. (2010) was identified 
as the relevant study for exposure characterization (sampling from North America), and 
half the MRL (40  ng/m3) and maximum (230 ng/m3) concentrations were used to 
estimate potential exposures to DEHP via ambient air (Appendix D, Table D-3a). 
No Canadian data were identified for DEHP in drinking water. In Canada, Cao et al. 
(2008) surveyed phthalates in bott led carbonated and non -carbonated water and 
detected and quantified DEHP in all 11 samples (range: 0.052 to 0.338  µg/L). 
Internationally, DEHP was also detected and quantified in bottled water (Jeddi et al. 
2015 ; Pourzamani et al. 201 7; Zaki et al. 2018 ), mineral and soda water (Yang et 
al.2017),  drinking water (Liu et al. 2015), and surface waters (Li et al. 2015; Net et al. 
2015; Selvaraj et al. 2015 ; Martins et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017 ). In the absence of 
Canadian and North American data on levels of DEH P in tap water, mean (0.102µg/L) 
and maximum (0.338 µg/L) DEHP concentrations in bottled non -carbonated water were 
used to estimate the general population daily intake from drinking water (Cao et al. 
2008) in Canada (Appendix D, Table D-3a).  
Khosravi and Price (2015) reported various phthalates in agricultural soils in both 
control and biosolid amended soils collected in Nova Scotia, Canada. DEHP was 
reported at 0.06 ng/g (control soil) and 4.3 ng/g (biosolid amended) (Khosravi and Price 
2015) . DEHP has also been detected in soils  internationally  (Cheng et al. 2015; Tran et 
al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015a ; Skrbic et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016; Wang 
et al. 2018 ). The reported concentration of DEHP in control agricultural soils (0.06  ng/g; 
Khosravi and Price 2015) was used to estimate potential exposures to DEHP via soil in 
Canada (Appendix D, Table D-3a). 
Products available to  consumers   
65 Globally, DEHP may be present in a wide variety of manufactured items, including 
childcare articles, children’s toys, DIY products, electronics, textiles,  household residual 
waste plastic  and gloves ( HPD 1993 - ; Stringer et al. 2000; AGDH 2010; US CPSC 
2010; ECHA 2012; Chao  et al. 2013; Korfali et al. 2013 ; Pvinenko et al. 2016 ). In 
Canada, DEHP  has also been reported as a plasticizer used in various types of 
manufactured items (NRC 2012; See table 2 -2; Environment Canada 2014).   
DEHP may be found in paint products ( AGDH 2010). The use has also been reported in 
Canada (Environment Canada 2014).   
Globally, DEHP may have applications in the production of articles that may come in 
contact with skin ( HPD 1993 - ; AGDH 2010; ECHA 2012; NRC 2012; Chao  et al. 2013; 
US CPSC CHAP 2014). The US CPSC CHAP (2014) reported that dermal exposure to 
items containing DEHP (i.e., play pen, change pad) would contribute to >10% of 
exposure to DEHP for infants and children.  It was also reported in jeans and to 
subsequent ly rub-off to legs in adults  (as measured via dermal wipes)  in China (Gong et 
al. 201 6) and i n cotton and polyester fabrics (>90% detection) purchased in the United 
States (Saini et al. 2016) .  
Exposure to DEHP from these uses is considered to be captured by the available 
Canadian biomonitoring data, therefore estimates of exposure were not calcul ated.  
Toys and childcare articles  
Numerous studies have examined the concentrations of DEHP in childcare articles and 
toys (Stringer et al. 2000; Biedermann -Brem et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2011; Korfali et 
al. 2013 ; Ashworth et al.2018 ; Makkliang et al. 2 017). A summary of DEHP reported in 
toys and childcare articles available in Canada is presented in Table 9-8.  
Table 9-8. Percent content of DEHP in various toys and childcare articles 
available in Canada

(Canada)  
33 of 72 samples  >0.1-22.8%  Health Canada 2007 
(Canada)  
a Among the eight samples where DEHP was detected, f ive samples  were below the regulatory limit  (0.1%)  with 
concentrations of 0.00 6-0.03% and three samples  were above with concentrations of 1.5 -36%.  For the three samples 
above the regulatory limit, the Consumer Product Safety Directorate of Health Canada has taken enforcement action  
to remove those products from the Canadian marketplace .  
66 Currently, Canada ( like the United States and the European Unio n) has regulations in 
place limiting the amount of certain phthalates (including DEHP) in toys and childcare 
articles ( Phthalates Regulations  under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act  
[Canada 2016] ). In Europe, results from the 2016 enforcement project (ECHA 2018) 
indicated that phthalates had one of the highest non -compliant rates, with 20% of toys in 
violation of REACH Annex XV11 entry 51 (DEHP, DBP, BBP; ECHA 2018). The US 
CPSC recently stated that less than 10% of exposures to DEHP for infants and children 
would result from mouthing of toys and childcare articles (US CPSC CHAP 2014).  
Given the regulations already in place for  DEHP in toys and childcare articles in 
Canada , exposure was not quantifie d and oral intakes from mouthing toys and/or 
childcare articles were not estimated.  
Personal care products  
On the basis of notifications submitted under the Cosmetic Regulations,  DEHP is not 
expected to be present in cosmetics in Canada (personal communica tion from the 
CPSD , HC, to ESRAB, HC, July 2015 ; unreferenced ). However, DEHP has been 
detected in various types of and personal care products in Canada (Koniecki et al. 
2011) and internationally (Guo and Kannan 2013; Guo et al. 2013).  Liang et al. (2013) 
did not detect DEHP in cosmetics in China. DEHP has also been reported in some 
fragrance products (0 -46ppm; Not too Pretty 2015). This presence may be due to 
potential migration from packaging. A summary of recent studies measuring 
concentrations of DEHP p ersonal care products reported in North America is outlined in 
Table 9-9.

DEHP is on the List of Prohibited and Restricted Cosmetic Ingredients in Canada  
(Health Canada 2011a) and was not reported as used in Canada (July 2015 email from 
the CP SD to ESRAB, Health Canada). Additionally, the Canadian study reported that  
67 detection frequencies are low (1 % to 5%) and a majority of the concentrations in all 
studies are in the sub -ppm range . Consequently, exposure to DEHP from personal care 
products an d cosmetics is not considered to be significant. Exposure estimates from 
this source were not generated.  
Adult toys  
 
No Canadian use of DEHP in adult toys was reported under the CEPA section 71 
industry survey ( Environment Canada 2014). Global use patter ns suggest that there is 
potential for use of DEHP in adult toys. DEHP was reported in 8 of 15 adult toys 
sampled in the EU, with concentrations ranging from 0.73 to 702 mg/g (Bavarian State 
Ministry of the Environment and Public Health 2012). The Danish E nvironmental 
Protection Agency published a report assessing exposure to DEHP from these products 
and derived intakes of 1.7 and 47 µg/kg bw/day, for normal -case and worst -case 
exposures, respectively (Nilsson et al. 2006).   
 
Medical devices  
Globally, DEHP  is reported to be used in medical applications (ECHA 2012). Medical 
devices may therefore be a potential source of DEHP exposure. Currently, Canada has 
guidance in place for DEHP in medical devices. However, given the lack of data and 
uncertainty in quantifying estimates of exposure from medical devices, this exposure 
source was not quantified and is currently an uncertainty in this screening assessment.  
DnHP  
No Canadian  data were identified for DnHP in air or water . Internationally, DnHP was 
detected  in indoor air in homes in Vietnam (range: nd -1.53 ng/m3; Tran et al. 2017). It 
was detected in drinking water in Bogota , Colombia (0.01 -37 µg/L; Bedoya -Rios et al. 
2018).  
DnHP was surveyed in the CHDS and was detected in 98% of homes (range: ND –
264 µg/g,  median: 3.8 µg/g, 95 th percentile: 62 µg/g) (Kubwabo et al. 2013). DnHP has 
also been reported in house dust in the United States (Dodson et al. 2015). The 
Canadian survey (Kubwabo et al. 2013) was identified as the key study for exposure 
characterization , and median (3.8 µg/g) and 95 th percentile (62 µg/g) concentrations 
were used to estimate the Canadian general population daily intake of DnHP from dust 
(Appendix D, Table D-4a). DnHP was also reported  to be present  in dust in Vietnam 
(Tran et al. 2016) . 
No Canadian or North American data were identified for DnHP in soil. DnHP has been 
detected in 100% of urban (n=17; median=0.018 µg/g, maximum=0.019 µg/g), suburban 
(n=28; median=0.016 µg/g, maximum=1.227 µg/g) and rural (n=37; median=0.016 µg/g, 
maximum=0 .1 µg/g) soils in China (Hongjun et al. 2014)  and elsewhere in China (Li et 
al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016) . Given the limited data available on DnHP in soil, exposure 
intakes from this source were not estimated.   
68 No Canadian data for DnHP in foods were found . One US study looked at many 
phthalates, including DnHP, in a variety of food items (Schecter et al. 2013). Data from 
this US study were employed to generate dietary exposure estimates using a 
probabilistic approach (Appendix D, Table D-4b). Internationally, DnHP has been 
reported to be present in foods in China (Li et al. 2016) . However, it was not detected in 
milk in Saudi Arabia (Sajid et al. 2016).  
The subpopulation with the highest exposure from dust and food consisted of infants (0  
to 6 months old ), with total daily intakes of 0.019 and 0.31 µg/kg bw/day estimated on 
the basis of  central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, respectively 
(Appendix D, Table D-4a).  
Given the absence of reporting to the CEPA section 71 industry surv ey (Environment 
Canada 2014), and the absence  of information as to DnHP presence in product 
databases, general population exposure to DnHP from products available to  consumers 
is expected to be negligible.  
DIOP  
No data were identified for DIOP in air, wate r, soil or food; therefore, intakes from these 
sources were not estimated.    
DIOP was surveyed in the CHDS and was detected in 87% of homes (range: ND –
1165  µg/g, median: 6.6 µg/g, 95 th percentile: 28.6 µg/g) (personal communication from 
EHSRD , Health Canad a, to ESRAB, Health Canada, August 2014 ; unreferenced ). 
These data were identified as the key study for exposure characterization, and median 
(6.6 µg/g) and 95 th percentile (28.6 µg/g) concentrations were used to estimate the 
Canadian general population daily intake of DIOP from dust (Appendix D, Table D-5). 
In Canada, DIOP has also been reported as a plasticizer used in various types of 
manufactured items (See Table 5 -1; Environment Canada 2014). However, given the 
low volume of DIOP reported in Canada (See table 4 -2), exposure estimates from 
products available to  consumers were not estimated.   
The subpopulation with the highest exposure from dust consisted of in fants (0  to 6 
months  old), with total daily intakes of 0.033 and 0.14 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the 
basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, respectively (Appendix D, 
Table D-5).   
69 9.1.3  Long -chain phthalates  
For detailed information on long -chain phthalates included in this section, please refer to 
the SOS report on long -chain phthalates esters (Environment Canada, Health Canada 
2015d).  
DIDP  
 
Exposure estimates were calculated using biomonitoring results as well as data on 
DIDP occurrence in dust, food and plastic items. They are presented in the LCP SOS 
report (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015d) and summarized below. Recently, 
DIDP has b een reported internationally in soils ( Tran et al. 2015), indoor air ( Takeuchi 
et al. 2014 ; Giovanoulis et al. 2018 ), dust ( Luongo and Östman 2015 ; Luongo et al. 
2016; Giovanoulis et al. 2018 ), and tap water ( Yang et al. 2014) . DIDP was also 
measured in to ys and childcare articles above the regulated limit in 10% of toys tested 
in Europe (ECHA 2018). However, these reported values did not change the exposure 
estimates presented previously (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015d).  
The highest exposed group according to biomonitoring data (all sources, NHANES) is 
male children aged 6 to 11 year s, with median and 95 th percentile intakes of 1.4 and 
4.4 µg/kg bw/day respectively. For older populations, the highest exposed group (all 
sources, NHANES) is adults ov er 20 year s of age , with median and 95 th percentile 
intakes of 0.76 and 4.4 µg/kg bw/day, respectively, for males, and 0.65 and 4.9 µg/kg 
bw/day , respectively,  for females . 
The subpopulation with the highest exposure from dust and food consisted of infants  (6 
months to 4 years old), with total daily intakes of 0.514 and 2.87 µg/kg bw/day 
estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, 
respectively. For populations aged 12 years and over , the highest exposed group is 
adolescents  (aged 12 to 19 year s), with total daily intakes of 0.075 and 0.726 μg/kg bw/day 
estimated on the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations , 
respectively.  
Estimated daily intakes for infants from dermal exposure to DIDP from plastic items , 
based on lower -end and upper -bounding exposure scenarios, were 0.27 and 2.16 µg/kg 
bw/day, respectively. For adults exposed to plastic items (females aged 20 years and 
over), estimated daily intakes , based on lower -end and upper -bounding exposure 
scenari os, were 0.27 and 0.85 µg/kg bw/day , respectively.  
DUP  
Exposure estimates were calculated using data on DUP occurrence in dust and plastic 
items.  Since the publication of the LCP SOS report , DUP has been analyzed in foods 
included in the 2013 Canadian Total Diet Study and was not quantified above the 
method detection limit (average MDL= 6.97 ng/g; Cao et al. 2015). Exposure estimates  
70 for DUP are presented in the LCP SOS report (Environment Canada, Health Canada 
2015d) and summarized below.  
The subpopula tion with the highest exposure from dust consisted of infants (0  to 6 
months old), with total daily intakes of 0.0198 and 0.349 µg/kg bw/day estimated on the 
basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, respectively. For 
populations aged 12 years and over , the highest exposed group is adolescents ( aged 
12 to 19 year s), with total daily intakes of <0.001 and 0.004 μg/kg bw/day estimated on 
the basis of central tendency and upper -bounding concentrations, respectively.  
Estimated daily intakes f or infants from dermal exposure to DUP from plastic items , 
derived on the basis of lower -end and upper -bounding exposure scenarios , were 2.7 
and 21.6 µg/kg bw/day , respectively. For adults exposed to plastic items (females aged 
20 years and over), estimated daily intakes , based on lower -end and upper -bounding 
exposure scenarios , were 2.7 and 8.5 µg/kg/day , respectively.  
 Health effects assessment  
As described in detail in the SOS reports (Environment Canada, Health Canada 
2015a ,b,c,d), critical effects of phthalates (i.e., medium -chain phthalates) consist of 
adverse effects on the development of the male reproductive system following 
exposure. The spectrum of effects on male reproductive development has been 
described as the “rat pht halate syndrome” (RPS) and although primarily studied in rats, 
it has also been demonstrated in other species. The effects include alterations of 
feminization parameters (decreased anogenital distance [AGD] in pups and nipple 
retention [NR] in juveniles), reproductive tract malformations (cryptorchidism [CRY], 
hypospadias [HYP], testicular pathological changes [TP]) and effects on fertility (sperm 
counts, motility and quality at adulthood). Similar to the SOS reports, the hazard 
assessment is structured to present information at three different life stages (gestational 
exposure [GD0 -21], (pre)pubertal -pubertal [PND1 -55] and adult [PND55+], with 
particular focus on the male gender because of the varying degrees of sensitivity at 
different life stages. When th ere was limited information or absence of data for a 
particular phthalate at a specific life stage or exposure period (as it is the case for DMP, 
DIBP, DMCHP, DBzP, B84P, B79P, CHIBP, BCHP, BIOP, and DUP), read -across was 
applied based on health effects of  the closest analogue(s) (Health Canada 2015). In 
addition, potential effects of phthalates on humans were evaluated following the same 
approach as previously described in the SOS reports (Environment Canada, Health 
Canada 2015a ,b,c,d).

Evidence in humans  
A literature update was also conducted to identify any recent human data for short -chain 
phthalates. The updated search was focused on reproductive and developmental 
endpoints in males because these endpoints were identified as critical health endpoints 
in the SOS reports. Studies were further evaluated and scored for quality using a 
consistent evaluation metric (Downs and Black 1998). For the health outcomes 
evaluated (i.e., sex hormone levels, anogenital distance, birth measures, male infant 
genitalia, pr eterm birth and gestational age, altered male puberty, gynecomastia, 
changes in semen parameters, pregnancy loss , and altered time to pregnancy), there 
was inadequate evidence or no evidence of associations between DMP and the 
reported outcomes (Table 9-13). More detail is provided in Health Canada (201 8c; 
2018d ) available upon request.

9.2.2  Medium -chain pht halates and additional phthalates  
9.2.2.1 Medium -chain phthalates  
DIBP  
The MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) summarizes the health 
effects literature related to DIBP. While two  new animal hazard studies were identified 
for this phthalate after the literature cut -off date of the MCP SOS  (Pan et al. 2017; Wang 
et al. 2017), n either  of these studies would impact the risk characterization as animals in 
both studies were only exposed to one dose level of 450 mg  DIBP /kg-bw/day , which is 
higher than the no-observed -adverse -effects level (NOAEL) values previously identified 
for DIBP in the MCP SOS .  
Table 9-14 provides critical endpoints and corresponding NOAEL and/or lowest -
observed -adverse -effects level (LOAEL) values for DIBP,  as previously described in 
MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) , that will be used for risk 
characterization. DIBP has low systemic toxicity as described in MCP SOS 
(Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b); hence, no systemic critical effect s were 
established.

DCHP  
The MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) summarizes the health 
effects literature related to DCHP. A literature update identified new developmental and 
genotoxicity studies, which are summarized in Tables 9-15 and 9-16. In Li et al. (2016), 
rats were exposed to 0, 10, 100 or 500 mg/kg -bw/day DCHP from GD12 -21. The body 
weight of male pups was significantly reduced in treated animals. DCHP dose -
dependently increased abnormal fetal cell aggregation and decreased fetal Leydig cell 
size, cytoplasmic size and nuclear size at all doses tested. Decrease s in AGD and 
increase d incidence s of MNGs were noted at 100 mg/kg -bw/day and above. In another 
study, the authors also examined the effects of in utero  DCHP exposure on offspr ing 
development  (Ahbab and Barlas 2015) . Rats were exposed to 0, 20, 100 or 500 mg/kg -
bw/day DCHP from GD6 -19. Maternal effects were not observed. An increase in 
resorption was observed in all treated groups. A decrease in AGD and testicular 
pathological c hanges were observed starting from 20 mg/kg -bw/day. The LOAEL s of 
these studies are lower than the lowest NOAEL previously identified in the MCP SOS 
for DCHP (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b). As described in the MCP SOS 
for DCHP, a decrease in AGD  was observed at higher doses in both F1 (at 511 mg/kg -
bw/day) and F2 (from 107 mg/kg -bw/day) generations in a two-generation study with a 
NOAEL of 21 mg/kg -bw/day (Hoshino et al. 2005), suggesting transgeneration al effects 
induced by DCHP. The dose level of 16  to 21 mg/kg -bw/day from this two-generation 
study was also identified as the NOAEL for developmental effects by the Australian 
National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme ( NICNAS ) (AGDH 
2008) and the US CPSC CHAP (2014). Differen t stains of rats were used by Ahbab and 
Barlas (2015) than by Hoshino et al. (2005)  and Li et al. (2016) (Wistar vs Sprague 
Dawley, respectively) . The lowest LOAEL s identified for developmental toxicity w ere 
10 to 20 mg/kg -bw/day estimated on the basis of testicular pathological changes from  
75 10 mg/kg -bw/day , reduced AGD, and increased resorption from 20 mg/kg -bw/day 
(Ahbab and Barlas 2015 ; Li et al. 2016 ).

As described in the MCP SOS for DCHP (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b), 
only one limited repeat -dose oral exposure study with DCHP was identifie d in sexually 
immature animals . That study was determined to be limited and was not used to 
characterize risk of DCHP for this life stage. Therefore, results from the two-generation 
study (Hoshino et al. 2005) described in the MCP SOS were used, particular ly 
observations reported in the F1 males exposed in utero  to DCHP through lactation  and 
via diet from PND21 for at least 10 weeks until necropsy. The NOAEL for the 
reproductive toxicity of DCHP at the prepubertal -pubertal life stage was 18 mg/kg -
bw/day in F1 males, based on observed decreases in spermatid head counts and 
testicular atrophy starting from 90 mg/kg -bw/day. Reduced body weight gain and 
reduced food consumption were observed in F1 males at 90 mg/kg -bw/day and above. 
It is recognized that this ef fect level is conservative as animals had been exposed 
during early development before the prepubertal -pubertal life stage.  
Tables 9-17 and 9-18 provide the critical endpoints and corresponding NOAEL and/or 
LOAEL values for DCHP that will be used for risk characterization.

DMCHP  
As described in the MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b), DCHP 
was used as an analogue as no studies examining the potential health effects of

B79P  
The MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) summarizes the health 
effects literature related to B79P and its analogues. New key studies were identified 
after the literature cut -off date of the MCP SOS, which are described  in the following 
sections and will be used for risk characterization.  
Early development: in utero  exposure to B79P  
Three oral rat studies were found focusing on effects of B79P during development, 
including one study that was previously described in the M CP SOS. These studies all 
examined the effects of B79P when administered during gestation in pregnant rats 
during the fetal masculinization programming window GD15 -17. Summaries of the 
studies are described in Table 9-24 below.  
In an industry submitted dev elopmental study, Tyl et al. (2012) exposed Sprague -
Dawley rats to B79P via the diet from GD6 -20, at target concentrations of 0, 250, 750 or 
3750 ppm (reported intakes: 0, 19, 58 and 288 mg/kg -bw/day). There were no effects 
on maternal body weight, althoug h food consumption was significantly increased in a 
dose -related manner in the two highest dose groups for the exposure. At necropsy, both 
absolute and relative liver weights were significantly increased at the highest dose; no 
adverse effects were observe d at histological examination. There was no effect on the  
81 mean number of live fetuses per litter or fetal body weight. There were no differences 
among groups in the incidence ( fetal or litter) of either external malformations/variations 
or of skeletal malf ormations. Similarly, there were no differences in the total number of 
malformations (external, visceral, skeletal). The authors concluded that there had been 
maternal toxicity at the highest dose only, with increased absolute and relative liver 
weight s and “no adverse findings in the prenatal offspring at any dose .” Parameters 
specific to RPS (AGD, NR, PPS, etc) were not reported.  
In a second industry submitted study, Tyl et al. (2013) also conducted a two -generation 
reproductive toxicity study with Spr ague -Dawley rats exposed to B79P at 0, 250, 750, 
2500 and 5000 ppm (estimated doses: 0, 19, 56, 188 and 375 for males and 0, 17, 50, 
167 and 333 mg/kg -bw/day for females). F0 and F1 male and female rats were exposed 
for 10 weeks premating and 2 weeks matin g. Female rats were also exposed 
throughout gestation (approximately 3 weeks) and lactation (3 weeks). There were no 
differences in maternal or offspring lactational parameters or in F1 litter parameters on 
PND 0 -4. No effects were observed in AGD across g roups. No differences were 
observed in acquisition of PPS in F1 males. There was no evidence of effects on 
mating, production of litters , or litter size. Other parameters specific to RPS, specifically 
NR, HYP and CRY , were not reported.  
In the F2 generatio n, there were no differences in total litter size, live litter size, live birth 
ratio, survival ratio, AGD, pup body weight or gross pathology. Relative liver weight was 
increased in both F2 males. The authors concluded that B79P was “clearly not a 
reprodu ctive toxicant in either sex” at exposures up to 333 –375 mg/kg -bw/day . 
However , a NOAEL of 50 –56 mg/kg -bw/day was assigned for systemic toxicity on the 
basis of reduced body weights and altered organ weights and organ/body weight ratios, 
affecting the live r and kidney, which were free from gross and histopathologic changes 
(Tyl et al . 2013).

aTestosterone levels measured (can include quantity/production) at varying days post -birth. T=Testicular 
testosterone; S=Serum testosterone.  
b Feminization parameters can include anogenital distance (AGD), nipple retention (NR), preputial separation (PPS).  
c Malformations include: cryptorchidism (CRY), hypospadias (HYP), testicular pathology (TP), and/or reproductive 
effects such as fertility (FER) in offspring (sperm number, motility) or reproductive success at adult stage after in 
utero  exposure.  
d Other developmental effects include: decreases in overall fetal body weight at PND 1 (BW), decreases in 
reproductive organ weight (ROW), fetal viability (FV), embryotoxicity (EMB), or on the incidence of external, skeletal 
or visceral malformations (ESV). Other organ weights (OW).  
e Lowest dose tested in the study.  
f CYP, HYP and NR effects were observed on PND21, but not on PND75 where these an imals were exposed until 
PND21 (ECHA 2013b).  
g NR result was based the executive summary of the study saying there were no effects in both F1 and F2. No 
additional info on NR was found in the rest of the report (Tyl et al. 2013).  
NM = Not measured.  
NE = No  effect observed at the dose range tested. When NE is presented alone in the first 4 columns of effects, all 
parameters in the footnote description were measured and no statistically significant effects were observed in the 
endpoints at the dose range admi nistered.  
 
Overall,  the highest  NOAEL  identified  for developmental  toxicity  of B79P  after 
gestational  exposure  was 50 mg/kg -bw/day  based  on decreased  AGD  in male  pups  and 
increased  incidence  of epispadias  on PND21  observed  at the next dose  level of 250 
mg/kg-bw/day  (REACH  dossier;  ECHA  2013b).  A decrease  in AGD  on PND1  and a 
slight increase in the incidence of CRY were also observed at 50 mg/kg -bw/day and 
evidence of retained nipples was observed at 500 mg/kg -bw/day on PND21. It should 
be noted that there i s uncertainty regarding this critical NOAEL as no AGD effect was 
observed on PND 1 in both F1 and F2 in a recent two-generation reproductive toxicity 
study up to 333 mg/kg -bw/day (Tyl et al. 2013). Both studies (REACH dossier; ECHA 
2013b; Tyl et al. 2013) were conducted using the same strain of rat. No information was 
provided by Tyl et al. (2013) to explain this discrepancy. The NOAEL  for maternal  
systemic  toxicity  was considered  to be 50 mg/kg -bw/day based  on decrease  body  
weight  gain during  gestation  and liver and kidney  effects  at 250 mg/kg -bw/day (Tyl et al. 
2013).  
Exposure to B79P at prepubertal -pubertal life stage  
In the MCP SOS, the critical effect level for the reproductive toxicity of B79P was based 
on read across from closest analogues as no studies were identified for this life stage. 
Since the publication of the MCP SOS  report , an u npublished two-generation 
reproductive toxicity study was submitted by industry as described above; therefore,  
84 results from the two-generation study were consider ed, particularly observations 
reported in the F1 males that were exposed in utero , through lactation to B79P and via 
diet until necropsy at PND126 (Tyl et al. 2013).  
There were transient reductions on male body weight gain at 2500 ppm (188 mg/kg -
bw/day) on  PND56 -63, but no effects on terminal body weights or body weight gains at 
the end of treatment (PND126). No effects on reproductive organ weights were 
observed at any dose, nor were there any histopathological findings reported. No effect 
on sperm counts or motility; however, a small, statistically significant increase in 
abnormal sperm was noted at all dose groups (19 mg/kg -bw/day and above), but there 
were no effects on reproductive performance of F1 males with the exception of a 
significantly longer pre coital interval (p<0.05) at the highest dose (375 mg/kg -bw/day). 
Changes in abnormal sperm were 1.45, 1.72, 1.96, 1.91, and 2.31% in 0, 19, 56, 188, 
and 375 mg/kg -bw/day, respectively , which reflect a 16 % to 37% increase compared to 
control. The authors no ted these percent abnormal sperm values were within the 
laboratory’s historical control values for this rat strain and supplier. In addition, these 
values, although showing a dose -responsive nature, are also within typical ranges for 
untreated males of thi s strain in other laboratories (Kato et al. 2006; Matsumoto et al. 
2008).  
Systemic effects were limited to statistically significant increases in relative liver weights 
at 56 mg/kg -bw/day and 375 mg/kg -bw/day, but not at 188 mg/kg -bw/day with no 
histopath ological findings. There were no changes in absolute or relative adrenal 
glands, but observations of small, increased incidences of bilateral cortical vacuolation 
at the highest dose tested (375 mg/kg -bw/day; 9 males).  
There were no differences in offsprin g lactational parameters. There were no 
differences in F1 litter parameters on PND 0 -4. No differences were observed in AGD 
across groups. No differences were observed in acquisition of PPS in F1 males.  
Overall, the NOEAL for the reproductive toxicity of B79P at the prepubertal -pubertal life 
stage was 375 mg/kg -bw/day since no adverse health effects were observed at the 
highest dose level tested in F1 males in the two-generation study by Tyl et al. (2013 ). 
The lowest LOEL for systemic effects was 375 mg/kg -bw/day based on small, increased 
incidences of bilater al cortical vacuolation in adrenal glands in the same above cohort.  
Oral exposure to B79P at the mature male adult stage  
In the MCP SOS, the critical effect level for the reproductive toxicity of B79P was based 
on read -across from closest analogues as no studies were identified for this life stage. 
One industry -submitted two -generation study was available after the literature cut -off 
date of the MCP SOS.   
Reproductive effects from a 14 -week exposure of  adult F0 males to B79P in diet from 
the two-generation study described in the section above showed no adverse effects in 
fertility or reproductive organs (Tyl et al. 2013). A small, statistically significant increase  
85 in abnormal sperm was noted at 56 mg/k g-bw/day and above, but there were no effects 
on sperm count, sperm motility or reproductive performance of F0 males  (Table 9 -25). 
Changes in abnormal sperm were 1.35, 1.59, 1.73, 1.95, and 2.16% in 0, 19, 56, 188, 
and 375 mg/kg, respectively, which reflec t a 22 % to 38% increase compared to control. 
The authors noted these percent abnormal sperm values were within the laboratory’s 
historical control values for this rat strain and supplier. In addition, these values, 
although showing a dose -responsive nature , are within typical ranges for untreated 
males of this strain in other laboratories (Kato et al. 2006; Matsumoto et al. 2008). One 
male in the highest dose group (375 mg/kg -bw/day) developed a misshapen bilateral 
testes. There was no evidence of effects on mating, production of litters , or litter size.

NM = Not measured.  
NE = No effect observed at the dose range tested. When NE is presented alone, all parameters in the footnote

Overall, the NO AEL for reproductive toxicity identified for B79P at the adult life stage 
was 375 mg/kg -bw/day since no adverse health effects were observed at the highest 
dose level tested in F0 adult male rats in a two generation diet study after 14 -week 
exposure to B79P (Tyl et al . 2013).  
Reproductive developmental e ffects: Oral exposure to B79P in females  
In a previously described two -generation study by Tyl et al. (2013), F0 females exhibited 
a significant increase  in absolute and relative liver weight s at both 167 and 333 mg/kg -
bw/day. There were no differences in maternal or offspring lactational parameters and 
no differences in F1 litter parameters on PND 0 -4. For F1 females, there were no 
differences in body weigh t at acquisition of vaginal patency; reproductive performance, 
fertility and fecundity were equivalent across all groups. There was no evidence of 
effects upon evidence of mating, production of litters of litter size for the production of 
F2 offspring. At weaning and termination of the F2 pups on PND 21, F1 females had 
equivalent vaginal cytology parameters and body weights. Absolute and relative liver 
weights were increased at 167 and 333 mg/kg -bw/day.  
Table 9-26 provides a summary of critical effects for the reproductive and/or

DINP  
The DINP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015c) summarizes the health 
effects literature related to DINP. Since the publication of the DINP SOS  report , a recent 
developmental study was identified (Tabl e 9-28). Li et al. (2015b) examined the effects 
of in utero  DINP exposure on offspring development. Rats were exposed to 0, 10, 100, 
500 or 1000 mg/kg -bw/day DINP during GD12 -21. No maternal toxicity was observed 
except in one dam at the highest dose level , which  died on GD21.5.  
Testicular pathological changes in Leydig cell s (clusters ) were first observed at 10 
mg/kg -bw/day and MNGs were observed starting from 100 mg/kg -bw/day. The LOEL of 
10 mg/kg -bw/day of this study is lower than the lowest NOAEL (50 m g/kg-bw/day) and 
LOAEL (159 -395 mg/kg -bw/day) (Waterman et al. 2000; Clewell 2011 cited in ECHA 
2013; Clewell et al. 2013) identified in the DINP SOS (Environment Canada, Health 
Canada 2015c). The NOAEL of 50 mg/kg -bw/day was also established by multiple 
agencies on the basis of the same studies ( AGDH  2012; ECHA 2013b; US CPSC 
CHAP 2014). It should be noted that similar MNGs and Leydig cell clusters effects were 
observed in Clewell (2011a, 2013) at 250 mg/kg -bw/day and above. At higher dose 
levels, other RP S-related parameters include decreased serum testosterone levels, 
decreased AGD, NR, effects in sperm and other histopathological effects in the testes 
were observed.  
Overall , the lowest LOEL identified for developmental toxicity was 10 mg/kg -bw/day 
based  on testicular pathological changes (i.e., MNGs and Leydig cell clusters) observed 
at the next dose level of 100 mg/kg -bw/day (Li et al. 2015b).

CHIBP, BCHP and BIOP  
As described in the MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b), no 
studies examining the potential reproductive/developmental health effects of CHIBP, 
BCHP and BIOP were identified. An updated literature search conducted after the 
literature cut -off date of the MCP SOS did not identify any new studies. As described in 
the exposure assessment, general population exposure to CHIBP, BCHP and BIOP 
from environmental media and products available to consumers is expected to be 
negligible. Therefore, risk t o human health for this substance is not expected.  
Evidence in humans  
A literature update was conducted to identify any recent human data for medium -chain 
phthalates  since the publication of the MCP SOS  report . The search was focused on 
reproductive and d evelopmental endpoints in males as these endpoints were identified 
as critical health endpoints in the SOS reports. Studies were further evaluated and 
scored for quality using a consistent evaluation metric (Downs and Black 1998). For the 
health outcomes e valuated (i.e., sex hormone levels, AGD , birth measures, male infant 
genitalia, preterm birth and gestational age, altered male puberty, gynecomastia, 
changes in semen parameters, pregnancy loss , and altered time to pregnancy), there 
was limited evidence o f association between DINP and sex hormone levels (Main et al. 
2006; Joensen et al. 2012; Mouritsen et al. 2013; Meeker and Ferguson 2014; Specht 
et al. 2014; Axelsson et al. 2015a; Jensen et al. 2015; Lenters et al. 2015a; Pan et al. 
2015) or semen parameters (Joensen et al. 2012; Jurewicz et al. 2013; Specht et al. 
2014; Axelsson et al. 2015a; Lenters et al. 2015a; Pan et al. 2015). There was 
inadequate evidence or no evidence of association for the other medium -chain 
phthalates in the Phthala te Substance Grouping and the outcomes (Table 9-32). More 
detail is provided in Health Canada (201 8c; 2018d ).

(Health Canada 2018c, 2018d) :  
LA = Limited: Evidence is suggestive of an association between exposure to a phthalate or its metabolite and a 
health outcome; however, ch ance, bias or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence  
IA = Inadequate : The available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency or statistical power to permit a 
conclusion regarding the presence or absence of an association;  
NA = No evidence of association: The available studies are mutually consistent in not showing an association 
between the phthalate of interest and the health outcome measured.  
NM = Not measured in studies of quartile 2 and above (See Health Canada [201 8c; 20 18d] for more details).

9.2.2.2 Additional phthalates  
As previously discussed in the CRA approach document (Environment Canada, Health 
Canada 2015e), additional phthalates identified to have common adverse effects within 
the RPS as a result of alterations will be considered to be included into the CRA. After 
both the exposure (see section 6.1) and hazard filters  were considered , BBP, DBP, 
DEHP, DnHP and DIOP were included in the CRA. Reproductive and development 
effects in males (i.e., RPS -related parameters) of these five additional phthalates were 
evaluated and summarized in the following sections. The RPS -related parameters were 
previously described in detail in the MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 
2015b).  
BBP  
The MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) summarizes the 
reproductive and development effects of BBP in section 9.2.8.1 , as BBP was identified 
as an analogue to B84P. Since the literature cut -off date of the MCP SOS, a recent 
developmental study was identified. Ahmad et al. (2014) examined the effects of in 
utero  BBP exposure on offspring development (Table 9-33). Significa nt decrease in fetal 
body weight was observed at 4  to 20 mg/kg -bw/day during development from PND1 to 
75. However, the percentage decrease in body weight was 2.5 % to 5% compared to 
untreated control animals. Maternal effects were observed at 4  to 20 mg/kg -bw/day with  
92 decrease in maternal body weight and increase in gestation length. RPS effects were 
observed at 100 mg/kg -bw/day with decrease in serum testosterone level, sperm effects 
and decrease in reproductive organ weights.

DBP  
Early development: in utero  exposure  
The European Commission classified DBP as a Category 1B reproductive toxicant 
(presumed human reproductive toxicant) as defined in the EU regulation on 
classif ication , labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (ECHA 2015a).  
A literature search ide ntified many studies examining the toxicity of DBP during 
gestation in rodents. For the purposes of characterizing effects during early male 
development, only studies in which effects of DBP were observed at doses below 250 
mg/kg -bw/day in rats and 500 mg/ kg-bw/day in mice following in utero  exposure during 
the masculinization programming window are reported here. Summaries of the studies 
are described below and in Table 9-35. 
 
Overall, adverse effects in the parameters used to describe  RPS in male rat offspring 
after in utero  exposure to DBP include decreased testicular testosterone levels, delayed 
PPS, decreased AGD, NR, CRY, gross and testicular malformations, and effects on 
fertility.  
 
A search of the available literature revealed nine studies examining the effects of 
gestational exposure of DBP during the masculinization programming window in mice . 
The majority did not examine the parameters used to describe  RPS, with only two 
reporting any testicular pathology and one examining te sticular testosterone levels 
(Marsman 1995; Gaido et al. 2007, Saffarini et al. 2012).  
 
The reproductive -developmental effects of DBP do not appear to be restricted to 
rodents , as one study was identified in rabbits exhibiting testicular pathological chan ges  
94 and sperm effects (Higuchi et al. 2003). A full summary of the health effects associated 
with gestational exposure to DBP is summarized in Health Canada 201 8b. Table 9 -35 
presents a list of key studies with effects from gestational exposure to DBP in m ale 
offspring.

f Nipple retention was observed as follows: Number of animals identified (%) were 0, 4, 13, 15, and 100 in controls, 
20, 200, 2000, and 10,000 ppm groups (Lee et al. 2004).

endpoints at the dos e range administered.  
NM = Not measured.  
NR = Results not recorded (but measurement was stated in the methods and materials).  
NS = Not statistically significant.  
 
Overall, the highest NOAEL identified for developmental toxicity of DBP after gestational 
exposure was 10 mg/kg -bw/day based on effects on fertility (decreased sperm count 
and motility and increase levels of abnormal sperm) (Ahmad et al. 2014) and a 
decrease in male offspring testicular testosterone levels at birth at the next dose of 50 
mg/kg -bw/day (Lehmann et al. 2004). This NOAEL is supported by evidence from other 
studies observing decreases in both the tubular and interstitial cell populations and 
altered seminiferous tubule morphometry along with other mild effects on spermatocyte 
developmen t at similar dose levels (Lee et al. 2004; Boekelheide et al. 2009). At lower 
doses, there was a slight reduction in spermatocyte development (1.5 -3 mg/kg -bw/day 
dose range); however, the severity of this effect at this dose was minimal to slight and 
only minimal at the second higher dose of 14 -19 mg/kg -bw/day (Lee et al. 2004). The 
lowest LOEL for maternal toxicity of DBP was 509 mg/kg -bw/day based on reductions in 
body weight gain (less than 10%) in exposed dams (Wine et al . 1997). One study in 
rabbits in dicates that DBP has also effects in other species, but it is unknown if these 
effects would occur at lower doses (Higuchi et al. 2003).    
97 Exposure at prepubertal/pubertal life stages  
A literature search identified many studies examining the reproductive toxicity of DBP in 
young rodents. For the purposes of brevity, only studies where effects of DBP were 
observed at doses below 500 mg/kg -bw/day in rodents were evaluated in this screenin g 
assessment.  
 
Overall, adverse effects in reproductive parameters observed in (pre)pubertal males 
after short -term exposure to DBP include changes in serum and testicular testosterone 
levels, histopathological effects in the testes, and potential effects  in fertility 
(spermatogenesis, sperm motility, and number). The majority of studies available used 
the rat as a model for evaluation, but only within a relatively high dose range (250 to 
1000 mg/kg -bw/day) which limits the interpretation of the potential reproductive toxicity 
of DBP in this species. One study conducted in mice examined effects at lower dose 
levels and reported  RPS effects at dose levels lower than those in rats (Moody et al. 
2013). One study was conducted in rabbits reporting  evidence of t esticular pathology 
(Higuchi et al. 2003). A full summary of the health effects associated with 
propubertal/pubertal exposure to DBP is summarized in Health Canada (201 8b). Table 
9-36 presents a list of key studies with effects from prepubertal/pubertal ex posure to 
DBP in males.

a Hormone levels can include quantity/production of testicular testosterone (T), serum testosterone (S), leutinizing

b Fertility parameters include sperm number, motility, morphology, viability, stages of spermatogenesis, or 
reproductive success at adult stage after in utero  exposure.  
c Reproductive tract pathology includes: testicular pathology (TP): any observations base d on histopathological 
examination of the testes such as, but not limited to, multinucleated gonocytes/germ cells (MNGs), necrosis, 
hyperplasia, clustering of small Leydig cells  (LC), vacuolisation of Sertoli cells, decrease in Leydig cell number, an 
incre ase in Leydig cell size, focal dysgenesis, and/or seminiferous tubule atrophy.  Anogenital distance (AGD),

Overall, the lowest LOEL identified fo r reproductive toxicity of DBP at the prepubertal -
pubertal life stage was 10 -50 mg/kg -bw/day based on delayed spermatogenesis in male 
mice exposed to DBP for 10 days at this dose and above (Moody et al. 2013). At the 
next dose level of 50 mg/kg -bw/day, sig nificant reduction in absolute AGD was 
observed on PND14 mice, but the effect was not significant when AGD was measured 
relative to body weight. An increase in immature Sertoli cell and disorganization w as 
observed at 100 mg/kg -bw/day. No comparison can be  made for rats as there were no 
studies available at similar dose ranges. The lowest dose tested in rats was 250 mg/kg -
bw/day with observation s of defective spermatogenesis, shrunken tubules, decrease in 
spermatogenic cells and Leydig cell numbers (Srivast ava et al. 1990a; Xiao -feng et al. 
2009). The lowest LOEL for systemic toxicity for mice was 500 mg/kg -bw/day based on 
increased relative heart weight after 3 days of DBP treatment. This effect was lost by 14 
days (Moody et al. 2013). One study in rabbits indicates that DBP also effects other 
species, but it is unknown if these effects would occur at lower doses (Higuchi et al . 
2003).   
Exposure at the mature male adult stage  
The MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) summarizes the health 
effects of DBP in sexually mature adult rats (PND55+) as DBP was identified as an 
analogue to DIBP. Since the literature cut -off date of the MCP SOS (Environment 
Canada, Health Can ada 2015b), new literature was identified (Table 9-37). DBP (0, 
200, 400 or 600 mg/kg -bw/day) was administered to rats by oral gavage for 15 days 
(Aly et al. 2015). At the lowest dose level of 200 mg/kg -bw/day, decrease in serum 
testosterone level, decreas e in sperm count, and decrease in sperm motility were 
observed. In addition, histopathological examination of the testes indicated 
degeneration with absence of spermatogenic series in the lumen of some seminiferous 
tubules starting from 200 mg/kg -bw/day. H owever, the results from this study are limited 
as systemic effect and clinical signs of the animals were not measured. In another 
study, adverse effects (testicular pathological changes and effects on sperm) were 
observed starting from 500 mg/kg bw/day (N air 2015).

DEHP  
Early development: in utero  exposure   
101 The European Commission classified DEHP as a Category 1B reproductive toxicant 
(presumed human reproductive toxicant) as defined in the EU regulation on 
classif ication , labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (ECHA 2015b).  
A literature search identified many studies examining the toxicity of DEHP during 
gestation in rodents. For the purposes of the CRA, only studies covering the 
masculinization programming window where effects of DEHP  were observed at doses 
at and below 50 mg/kg -bw/day in rats and 100 mg/kg bw/day in mice were evaluated in 
this screening assessment.  
Overall, adverse effects in the parameters used to describe  RPS in male rat offspring 
after in utero  exposure to DEHP in clude decreased serum and testicular testosterone 
levels, delayed PPS, AGD, increase incidences of NR and CRY, gross testicular 
malformations, and effects in fertility. A full summary of the health effects associated 
with gestational exposure to DEHP is su mmarized in Health Canada (201 8b). Table 9 -
39 presents a list of key studies with effects from gestational exposure to D EHP in male 
offspring.

bFeminization parameters can include anogenital distance (AGD), nipple retention (NR), preputial separation (PPS).  
cMalformations include: cryptorchidism (CRY), hypospadias (HYP), testicular pathology (TP), including multinucleated 
gonocytes (MNG), and/or reproductive effects such as fertility (FER) in offspring (sperm number, motility) or 
reproductive success a t adult stage after in utero  exposure. TTM = transabdominal testicular migration  
dOther developmental effects include: decreases in overall fetal body weight (BW), decreases in reproductive organ 
weight (ROW), fetal viability (FV), embryotoxicity (EMB), or on the incidence of external, skeletal or visceral 
malformations (ESV).  
e CRY was based on significant delay in testes descent. EMB was based on an additional crossover mating trial 
conducted using the 7500 and 100 00 ppm males and females (Wolfe and Layton 2003).  
f the effect levels for AGD and NR were based on 1 set out of 2 sets of experiments. Similar effects were observed at 
higher dose level in the other set of experiment. The effect level for ROW was based on combining the results of the 
2 sets of experiments (Christiansen et al. 2010).  
g CRY was based on undescended (ectopic) testes observed in three animals, exposed to either 5, 135 and 405 
mg/kg -bw/day (one case in each dose). In all three cases, undescended  testes were unilateral (right side) and 
located in the superficial inguinal pouch. The ROW effect level reported by author was adjusted for body weight by 
covariance analysis (Andrade et al. 2006a,b).  
NDR =No dose response relationship.  
NP = Not reported.  
NM = Not measured.  
NE = No effect observed at the dose range tested. When NE is presented alone in the first 4 columns of effects, all 
parameters in the footnote description were measured and no statistically significant effects were observed in the 
endpo ints at the dose range administered.  
Overall, the highest NOAEL identified for developmental toxicity of DEHP after 
gestational exposure was 4.8 mg/kg -bw/day based on small and/or aplastic epididymis, 
testicular pathology and other RPS effects observed in F1 and F2 at the next dose level 
of 14 mg/kg -bw/day in a multigenerational reproductive toxicity study (Wolfe and Layton 
2003; Blystone et al. 2010). This effect level was also established by other jurisdictions 
(European Commission  2008; Danish EPA 2012; US CPSC CHAP 2014; EFSA 2005). At 
similar dose levels of 10 -15 mg/kg -bw/day, decreases in AGD, increased NR, 
decreased reproductive organ weights, and delayed PPS were observed in rat offspring 
in other studies (Andrade et al. 2006a,b; Christiansen et al. 2010). The lowest NOEL for  
104 maternal toxicity of DEHP was 359 mg/kg -bw/day based on increase in liver weight and 
food consumption . 
Exposure at prepubertal/pubertal life stages  
A literature search identified many studies examining the reproductive toxicity o f DEHP 
in young rodents. Results from repeated -dose oral exposure studies in sexually 
immature rats (PND1 –55) have shown that administration of D EHP can cause  
reproductive effects in male rats.  
Overall, adverse effects observed in (pre)pubertal males after short -term exposure to 
DEHP  include changes in serum and testicular testosterone levels, histopathological 
effects in the testes, and potential effects in fertility (spermatogenesis, sperm motility, 
and number).  Reproductive effects observed in prepu bertal or pubertal mice after 
exposure to DEHP occurred at higher doses than rats. Other species were also found to 
be less sensitive than rats to DEHP. No significant effects were observed in 
Cynomolgus monkeys, marmosets and Syrian hamsters treated with DEHP.  A summary 
of the health effects associated with prepubertal/pubertal exposure to DEHP is 
summarized in Health Canada (201 8b). Table 9 -40 presents key studies with effects 
from prepubertal/pubertal exposure to DEHP in males.

a Hormone levels can include quantity/production of testicular testosterone (T), serum testosterone (S), leutinizing 
hormone (LH), glucocorticoid hormone (GC), or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).  
b Fertility parameters include sperm number, motility, mor phology, viability, stages of spermatogenesis, or 
reproductive success at adult stage after in utero  exposure.  
c Reproductive tract pathology includes: testicular pathology (TP): any observations based on histopathological 
examination of the testes such as, but not limited to, multinucleated gonocytes/germ cells (MNGs), necrosis, 
hyperplasia, clustering of small Leyd ig cells (LC), vacuolisation of Sertoli cells, decrease in Leydig cell number, an 
increase in Leydig cell size, focal dysgenesis, and/or seminiferous tubule atrophy.  
d Other effects include: Decreased overall body weight (BW), decreased reproductive organ  weight (ROW) and 
systemic toxicity (ST).  
e Lowest dose measured in the study.  
f Data were represented as 5% lower confidence bound of benchmark dose (BMDL 5). In juvenile males, preputial 
separation was delayed at the 300 mg/kg bw dose group. Testicular pathological changes were only examined at the 
300 mg/kg -bw/day dose group (Tonk et al. 2012).  
NM = Not measured.  
NE = No effect observed at the dose range tested. When NE is presented alone, all parameters in the footnote 
description were measured and no statistically significant effects were observed in the endpoints at the dose range 
administered.  
 
Overall, the highest NOAEL identified for reproductive toxicity of DEHP at the 
prepubertal -pubertal life stage was 10 mg/kg -bw/day based on a significant decr ease in  
106 absolute testis weight at the next dose level of 100 mg/kg -bw/day in rats exposed to 
DEHP for 5 days from PND21 (Dostal et al. 1988). At 200 mg/kg -bw/day, a decrease in 
spermatid heads was observed at 13 weeks of age in rats exposed for 5 days from  
PND6 (Dostal et al. 1988). Testicular pathological changes were observed at 300 
mg/kg -bw/day and higher in rats exposed to DEHP for 21 days from PND3 -5 (Cammack 
et al. 2003) and rats exposed for 40 days from PND10 or PND50 (Tonk et al. 2012).  
Exposure at  the mature male adult stage  
Studies examining the potential reproductive toxicity of DEHP at the adult male life 
stage (PND55+) were identified in rats, mice, marmosets and ferrets.  
In rats, chronic exposure to DEHP (104 weeks to 2 years) resulted in inhi bition of 
spermatogenesis starting from 10 -29 mg/kg -bw/day (Ganning 1991; David et al. 2000a). 
In animals treated for less than a chronic duration ( 2-13 weeks), inhibition of 
spermatogenesis, decrease d sperm count and decrease in sperm motility was observe d 
at 300 -900 mg/kg -bw/day (Poon et al. 1997; Wolfe and Layton 2003; Kwack et al. 2009; 
Tonk et al. 2012;  Abd-Ellah et al. 2016 ). Decrease in testis weight and testicular 
pathological changes were generally observed at 300 mg/kg -bw/day and above.  
Adult m ice, ferrets , and marmosets were found to be less sensitive than rats to DEHP. 
Systemic effects in mice such as a decrease in relative kidney weight and an increase 
in absolute liver weight were observed at 9 9 mg/kg -bw/day whereas effects on sperm 
and test icular pathological changes were observed at 292 mg/kg -bw/day in a chronic 
study (David et al. 2000b). In ferrets, testicular pathological changes, decrease s in body 
weight and increase s in liver weight were observed at a much higher dose level of 1200 
mg/kg-bw/day (Lake et al. 1976). In marmoset, only  peroxisome proliferator -activated 
receptor  (PPAR ) effects in liver were observed at 500 mg/kg -bw/day (Kurata et al. 
1998). A summary of  the health effects associated with adult life stage exposure to 
DEHP is summarized in Health Canada (201 8b). Table 9 -41 presents key study with

(David et al. 2000a).   
DnHP  
Early development: in utero  exposure  
The European Commission classified DnHP as a Category 1B  reproductive toxicant 
(presumed human reproductive toxicant) as defined in the EU regulation on 
classif ication , labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (ECHA 2015c).  
 
A literature search identified a number of recent studies examining the toxic ity of DnHP 
during gestation in rodents. For the purposes of the CRA, only studies covering the  
108 masculinization programming window in males were evaluated in this screening 
assessment.  
Overall, adverse effects in the parameters used to describe  RPS in mal e rat offspring 
after in utero  exposure to DnHP include decreased serum and testicular testosterone 
levels, delayed PPS, AGD, retention of nipple/areolae (NR), increase incidences of CRY 
and hypospadias, gross testicular malformations, and effects in ferti lity. Two studies 
were conducted in mice where embryotoxicity and effects on fetal viability were 
observed.  A summary of  the health effects associated with gestational exposure to 
DnHP is summarized in Health Canada (201 8b). Table 9 -42 presents a list of key 
studies with effects from gestational exposure to DnHP in male offspring.

reproductive success at adult stage after in utero  exposure. TTM = transabdominal testicular migration  
dOther developmental effects include: decreases in overall fetal body weight (BW), decreases in reproductive organ 
weight (ROW), fetal viability (FV), embryotoxicity (EMB), or on the incidence of external, skeletal or visceral 
malformations (ESV).

Overall,  the highest NOAEL identified for developmental toxicity of DnHP after 
gestational exposure was 5 mg/kg -bw/day based on decrease d serum or testicular 
testosterone levels, decrease d AGD at birth in males and testicular pathological 
changes observed at 20 mg/kg -bw/day or higher in rats (Ahbab and Barlas 2015; 
Saillenfait et al. 2013a).  
Exposure at prepubertal/pubertal life stages  
A literature search identified four studies examining the reproductive toxicity of D nHP in 
young sexually immature rats (PND1 –55). These studies were generally tested at high 
dose levels and did not describe  RPS-related parameters other than one study that was 
tested at lower dose level s using castrated male rats. A summary of  the health effects 
associated with prepubertal/pubertal exposure to DnHP is summarized in Health 
Canada (201 8b). Since available studies were limited, DEHP was identified , using the 
same chemical categories and read -across approach as th at used for  other phthalates , 
as the “closest analogue” phthalate , taking into consideration the similarities in 
monoester metabolism as well as the length and nature of the ester chains (Health 
Canada 2015).  
As described earlier in the DEHP section, the highest NOAEL identified for reproductive 
toxicity of DEHP at the prepubertal -pubertal life stage was 10 mg/kg -bw/day based on 
significant decrease s in absolute testis weight at the next dose level of 100 mg/kg -
bw/day in rats exposed to DEHP for 5 days fro m PND21 (Dostal et al. 1988). Therefore, 
the critical effect level of 10 mg/kg -bw/day will be used to characterize the risk of 
developmental toxicity of DnHP for this life stage.   
110 Exposure at the mature male adult stage  
Two studies examining the potential reproductive toxicity of DnHP at the adult male life 
stage (PND55+) were identified in rodents. One study was conducted in rats where 
RPS-related parameters were not measured. Another study was conducted in mice 
where fe rtility effects and testicular pathology were examined. A summary of  the health 
effects associated with adult stage exposure to DnHP is summarized in Health Canada 
(2018b). Table 9 -43 presents the key study with effects from exposure to DnHP in adult 
males .

DIOP  
Early development: in utero  exposure  
The European Commission classified DIOP as a Category 1B reproductive toxicant 
(presumed human reproductive toxicant) as defined in the EU regulation on 
classif ication , labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (ECHA 2015d).  
 
Three studies were id entified that were all conducted by Saillenfait et al. (2013b) during 
the masculinization programming window. Adverse effects in the parameters used to 
describe  RPS in male rat offspring after in utero  exposure to DIOP included decreased 
testicular testost erone levels, decreased AGD, increased incidence of NR and CRY, 
gross testicular malformations, and effects in fertility. A summary of  the health effects 
associated with gestational exposure to DIOP is summarized i n Health Canada (201 8b).

There were no repeated -dose oral exposure studies in adult animals with DIOP.  
DIHepP was identified as the appropriate analogue to use for read across . The MCP

literatu re related to DIHepP. Table  9-45, described in the above section, provides the 
critical endpoints and corresponding NOAEL and/or LOAEL values for DIOP.  
Evidence in humans  
A literature search was conducted to identify any human data for additional phthalat es. 
The search was focused on reproductive and developmental endpoints in males as 
these endpoints were identified as critical health endpoints in the SOS reports. Studies 
were further evaluated and scored for quality using a consistent evaluation metric 
(Downs and Black 1998).  
For the health outcomes evaluated (i.e., sex hormone levels, anogenital distance, birth 
measures, male infant genitalia, preterm birth and gestational age, altered male 
puberty, gynecomastia, changes in semen parameters, pregnancy l oss, and altered 
time to pregnancy), there was limited evidence of association  between  DEHP and sex 
hormone levels (Pan et al. 2006; Meeker et al. 2009; Li et al. 2011; Mendiola et al.

al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015b ; Thurston et al. 2016 ; Chang et al. 201 7; Chen et al. 2017 ). 
There was inadequate evidence or no evidence of association between the remaining 
phthalates and the outcomes ( Table 9 -46). More detail is provided in Health Canada 
(2018c; 2018d ).

(Health Canada 2018c, 2018d) :  
LA = Limited: Evidence is suggestive of an association between exposure to a phthalate or its metabolite and a 
health outcome; however, chance, bias or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence  
IA = Inadequate : The available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency or statistical power to permit a 
conclusion regarding the presence or absence of an association;  
NA = No evidence of association: The available studies are mutually consistent  in not showing an association 
between the phthalate of interest and the health outcome measured.

Evidence in humans  
A literature update was also conducted to identify any recent human data for long -chain 
phthalates. The search was focused on reproductive and developmental endpoints in 
males as these endpoints were identified as critical health endpoints in the SOS repor ts. 
No information is currently available on the potential reproductive -developmental effects 
of DUP in humans. Studies identified for DIDP were further evaluated and scored for 
quality using a consistent evaluation metric (Downs and Black 1998).  
For the health outcomes evaluated (i.e., sex hormone levels, anogenital distance, birth 
measures, male infant genitalia, preterm birth and gestational age, altered male 
puberty, gynecomastia, changes in semen parameters, pregnancy loss , and altered 
time to pregnan cy), there was no evidence of association between any of the long -chain 
phthalates evaluated and the outcomes (Table  9-49). More detail is provided in Health 
Canada (201 8c; 2018d ).

9.3.2  Medium -chain phthalates, additional phthalates and CRA  
The critical effect s of concern  of medium -chain phthalates consist ed of adverse effects 
on the development of the male reproductive system following gestational exposure, 
with a particular focus on RPS -related parameters  that were identified in the rat, the 
most sensitive species . These  parameters are considered adverse and relevant for 
characterizing risk of exposure of the general Canadian population to this subgrouping 
of phthalates. Please see MCP SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b) for 
a general summary and rationale.  
In cases where limited rat studies were available, effect levels in other species (i.e., 
mice) that were lower than in rats were used for risk characterization. Evidence in 
humans , based on the Downs and Black scoring system (Downs and Black 1998) , 
indicated limited evidence of association between DINP and sex hormone levels or 
semen parameters and between DEHP and sex hormone levels, birth measures or 
semen parameters . This support s the selection of th e mode of action for risk 
characterization.  
In the follow ing sections, human health risk from exposure to medium -chain phthalates 
within the Phthalate Grouping is characterized on an individual basis, followed by a 
CRA  to address the potential risk of concurrent exposure to medium -chain phthalates 
exhibiting a s imilar mode of action.

DIBP  
Table 9-51 provides all relevant exposure and hazard values for DIBP, as well as 
resultant MOEs, for determination of risk, which were previously describ ed in the MCP 
SOS (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b). Overall, the MOEs for DIBP are 
considered to be adequate to account for uncertainties in the exposure and health effect 
databases. From the information available, there is evidence that DIBP elicits  effects on 
the developing male reproductive system, indicative of RPS, which suggests  that DIBP 
has a common mode of action with other phthalates in this grouping.

was greater than 30%. For children aged 6 to 11 years, 26 μg/kg bw/d (RSE > 30%) was carried forward to risk 
characterization in order to be protect ive of this age group and because of the absence of low variability data, at the  
130 upper percentiles, for another comparable age group. For more details, see Environment Canada, Health Canada 
2015c.

e Migration rates used to estimate exposure were based on concentrations in toys (12.9 - 77%) that are higher than 
concentrations observed in recent Health Canada surveys (see Table 9 -3, Environment Canada, Health Canada 
2015c). Currently, Canada ( like the United States  and the European Union ) have regulations (0.1%) in place limiting 
the amount of certain phthalates (including DINP) in toys and childcare articles.  
 
CHIBP, BCHP and BIOP  
An examination of the potential developmental and reproductive toxicity of CHIBP, 
BCHP and BIOP using appropriate analogues for read -across revealed that these 
medium -chain phthalates have the potential to have significant effects on the 
developing male, i n addition to systemic effects (liver, kidney).  
 
On the basis of the information available, it can be concluded that CHIBP, BCHP and 
BIOP meet the criteria for inclusion in the evaluation of the potential cumulative risk of 
phthalates on the developing mal e reproductive system given the evidence of the 
effects of their analogues; however, there is no exposure at this time.  Consequently, the 
risk to human health for these substances is not expected.  
Although the above MOEs for the medium -chain phthalates in the Phthalate Substance 
Grouping described in this section are considered adequate on an individual basis, this 
does not address the potential risk of concurrent exposure to these substances and 
other phthalates exhibiting a similar mode of action. Hence, all 10 medium -chain 
phthalates in the Phthalate Substance Grouping will be included for risk characterization 
in a cumulative context.  
 
9.3.2.2  Cumulative risk assessment  
The human health approach for a CRA for this Grouping has been described in detail in 
the “Proposed approach for cumulative risk assessment of certain phthalates under the 
Chemical s Management Plan” document (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015e).  
Human health -focused approaches  for quantifying the cumulative risk of phthalates 
have been con ducted by several national organizations including the Australian 
Department of Health ( AGDH  2012, 2013, 2014a,b), the Danish Environmental 
Protection Agency (Danish EPA 2011), and the recently completed assessment by the 
United States Chronic Health Advis ory Panel (US CPSC CHAP 2014). This screening 
assessment uses  a tiered approach, following the schematic of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS) 
Framework for Risk Assessment of Combined Exposures to M ultiple Chemicals ( WHO 
2009; Meek et al. 2011). This framework exercises the default assumption that the 
substances being assessed act by dose addition and the evaluation of cumulative risk 
involves multiple tiers where each higher level is increasingly de pendent on additional  
131 data. The lower tier begins with simple assumptions and/or surrogate data for both 
hazard and exposure and refin ement  to a higher tier occurs if required and as the data 
allow s. 
For exposure characterization, if there is sufficient ev idence of co -occurrence, then a 
CRA can be considered. The exposure approach is described in the CRA approach 
document (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015e).   
In summary, the pivotal information that determined substances for inclusion into the 
CRA we re industry data collected under section 71 of CEPA (Environment Canada 
2014), detection in North American biomonitoring surveys (CHMS, MIREC, MIREC -CD 
Plus, P4, NHANES ; Health Canada 2011b; Health Canada 2013; Arbuckle et al. 2014 ; 
personal communication from EHSRD , HC, to ESRAB, HC, October 2013, 2014 , 
unreferenced ; Arbuckle et al. 2016 ; CDC 2014), and detection in household dust 
(CHDS; Kubwabo et al. 2013). For phthalate parent compounds (i.e., DEHP, DIBP, 
DBP, BBP, and DINP), with close to a 100% detect ion in various biomonitoring surveys, 
there was sufficient evidence for co -exposure; these substances w ere therefore 
assessed for cumulative risk.  
A significant number of phthalates within the medium -chain phthalates subgroup have 
not been monitored in bio monitoring samples, but are found in commerce in Canada. 
These substances (i.e., DIHepP, B79P, B84P, DCHP, and DIOP) were included in the 
assessment of cumulative risk on the basis of their in-commerce status coupled with 
close to 100% detection in dust sa mples from Canadian homes.  
Finally, given reporting limits and difficulties in determining import activity of substances, 
the CEPA section 71 survey may not have capture d all in-commerce activity. As a 
result, substances that fit the profile of non -reporti ng to section 71 and close to 100% 
detection in house dust samples were also assessed for cumulative risk (i.e., DMCHP, 
DBzP, and DnHP).  
There were  three populations of interest for which exposure estimates w ere considered 
for cumulative risk: pregnant women and women of childbearing age (characterized as 
women aged twelve and up), infants (covered by age groups 0 to 6 months , 6 months to 
4 years and 3 to 5 years18), and children (covered by age groups 6 months to 4 years 
and 5 to 11 years). Adolescents and adult males were  covered by this approach as they 
had generally lower estimates of phthalate  exposure  and are considered  less sensitive 
                                            
18 In all cases, 3 - to 5-year exposure intakes (quantified by biomonitoring concentrations) were used as 
surrogates for infant exposure and risk as this age group showed consistently higher intakes than the 
infant age group. This is a conservative approach.  0.5 - to 4-year exposure intakes (quantified by 
environmental media and fo od concentrations) were used to quantify exposure and risk for infants when 
this group showed higher intakes than for the < 0.5 -year-olds.        
132 to the reproductive effects of medium -chain phthalates compared to younger males (i.e. 
children)  (NAS 2008) . 
In terms of exposure estimates considered for cumulative risk, biomonitoring data, 
which generally captures all potential exposure sources and routes (environmental 
media, food and products available to consumers) was cons idered a primary source  of 
exposure information  and estimated monitoring data (chronic exposures resulting from 
environmental media and food) was considered as a supporting  source of exposure 
information . The US CPSC CHAP (2014) also use d biomonitoring dat a as the primary 
source of exposure  information  in their CRA. Regardless of route of exposure, 
phthalates , in general , are not considered acute toxicants, with LD 50 levels from dermal 
exposure being at minimum two - to five -fold higher than oral values, whi ch in turn are 
also high (Draize et al. 1948; David et al. 2001; Monsanto Company 1970 cited in US 
EPA 2006, 2010). Since phthalates  are metabolize d relatively quickly showing no 
accumulation, and excretion is rapid, within hours to days (Phokha et al. 200 2; Clewell 
et al. 2009), acute exposures were  not considered relevant for a CRA. It should also be 
noted that no other jurisdictions have addressed phthalate exposures and risk from 
acute, one -time, exposures ( AGDH 2011; ECHA 2013b; US CPSC CHAP 2014).  
Upper -bound exposure estimates were used to estimate individual phthalate levels in 
the CRA to account for the uncertainties associated with the exposure data.  The upper -
bound exposure estimates used to characterize the  cumulative risk for relevant 
popula tions of the 16 medium -chain phthalates are summarized in Appendix F (Tables 
F-1, F-2, F-3 and F -4). 
On the basis of the available information on the common adverse effects (RPS) and the 
observed differences in potencies within the medium -chain phthalates,  a lower -tiered 
hazard characterization using the hazard index (HI) was considered to be the most 
appropriate  approach . The HI method was selected because it offers the benefit of 
being simple and flexible and allows for an indication of which substance or  substances 
in the  CRA, or which source and route, may be the predominant contributor(s) to the 
overall risk. Identification of the substances or sources and routes that are drivers of the 
CRA is beneficial for informing risk management.  
An HI is the summa tion of the individual hazard quotients (HQs) for each individual 
substance to determine the overall cumulative risk of the substance group of interest. 
The HQ of each substance is the ratio of exposure to a reference value (RfV) which is 
calculated by div iding the critical effect level identified in the hazard database by a 
defined uncertainty factor [UF]). The HI equation is as follows: HI = ∑HQ = ∑ 
(exposure/ RfV). HI values of the medium -chain phthalates are calculated for the three 
subpopulations that r epresented the highest exposure groups.   
Critical effect levels have been established at three life stages (i.e., in utero , 
prepubertal/pubertal, and adult) because of different sensitivity to the adverse effects of 
phthalates on development and reproduct ion at different life stages . The critical effect 
levels identified for the in utero  life stage were  used to calculate the HI value for  
133 pregnant woman and for infants. The critical effect levels identified for the 
prepubertal/pubertal life stage were  used to calculate the HI value for children. The 
critical effect levels of the in utero  and prepubertal/pubertal life stages for the medium -
chain phthalates as well as the calculated RfV s are summarized in Appendix F (Table 
F-5 and F-6).  
Given that medium -chain phthalates have similar physical -chemical properties, have 
similar toxicological effects, and show an overall similarity in strength of their health 
effect databases (especially in regard s to in utero  exposure), the same default UF was 
used to  calculate HQ values for all phthalate s, for a giv en subpopulation . A similar 
approach was adopted by another jurisdiction (US CPSC CHAP 2014). For the 
calculation of the total HI for pregnant women/women of childbearing age and infants, 
an UF of 100 (10 f or intraspecies and 10 for interspecies differences) was used to 
calculate the RfV for the critical effect levels identified at the in utero  life stage. For 
children, a default UF of 300 was used to calculate the RfV for the critical effects levels 
identif ied for the prepubertal -pubertal life stage. An additional UF of 3 was applied in 
this case on the basis of the limitations of the health effects database for the prepubertal 
life stage (quality and quantity of the studies currently available), and taking into 
consideration the variability in exposure duration in the different studies as well as the 
possibility that animals might also have been exposed to medium -chain phthalates in 
utero . The HI values for pregnant women/women of childbearing age, infants , and 
children are presented in Table 9 -59 (also see Appendix F; tables F-7, F-8 and F-9).

Individual phthalates that had the highest contribution to the cumulative risk were  
identified. Tables F-7, F-8 and F-9 (in Appendix F) show that the same three phthalate 
compounds (DINP, DBP, DEHP) were the main contributors to the cumulative risk, 
regardless of the age group or source  of exposure data (biomonitoring or environmental 
media and food). Biomonitoring exposure estimates were  generally considered more 
representative of potential overall exposure, including  exposure from  products available 
to consumers (regardless of source, route or duration). As a result, the HI values 
calculated using biomonitoring data were  considered more realistic but still 
conservative, because  they were  calculated using upper -bound exposure estimates.  
Children and infants had higher HI values compared to pregnant women and women of 
childbearing age (aged 12 years and over). HI values calculated using biomonitoring  
134 data were lower than those calculated using environmental and dietary monitoring data 
for infants and children. In the case of DEHP, the high exposure from food w as in part 
due to the unexpected presence of DEHP in fruits and vegetables which would have 
overestimated actual dietary exposure to DEHP.  Nonetheless, this conservative, lower -
tiered HI approach indicated no concern for human health from potential cumulative 
exposure to medium -chain phthalates for the general Canadian population, specifically 
the more sensitive subpopulations (pregnant women/women of childbearing age, 
infants, and chil dren) , at current levels of exposure.  
An HI value greater than 1 would indicate the need for further investigation or 
refinement. The HI values for the three subpopulations with the highest exposures were 
all below 1. Therefore, further refinement to a hi gher-tiered assessment is not 
necessary at this time. While the potential cumulative risk is low at current levels of 
exposure to medium -chain phthalates (Phthalate Substance Grouping: DIBP, CHIBP, 
BCHP, DCHP, DBzP, B79P, DMCHP, DIHepP, BIOP, B84P, DINP; A dditional 
phthalates: DPrP, DBP, BBP, DnHP, 79P, DIOP, DEHP), an increase in exposure levels 
could represent a potential risk to human health.

databases.

 Uncertainties in Evaluation of Cumulative Risk to Human Health  
Uncertainties specific to short -chain, medium -chain, long -chain phthalates and DINP 
are summarized in the SOS reports (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2015b -e).  
The key sources of uncertainty related to the CRA are presented in the table below.  
Table 9 -62. Sources of uncertainty in the cumulative risk characterization  
Key source of uncertainty  Impact  
Data availability (multiple species, both sexes, sensitive ex posure 
periods) and data quality for certain phthalates.  +/- 
The unknown relevance of the available human epidemiological data 
studies implicating the potential hazard that certain phthalates pose to 
humans.  + 
The inherent limitations in the use of biomonitoring data for risk 
characterization related to methods, the chemical -specific variability in 
levels and metabolites as well as lack of availability of data for certain 
phthalates.  +/- 
The exclusion of estimates of exposure for products available to 
consumers in the CRA of phthalates, even if biomonitoring estimates 
would likely capture all exposure sources/routes, including exposure 
from products available to consumers.  -  
137 Key source of uncertainty  Impact  
The potential toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic differences between 
species an d between the individual chemicals.  +/- 
The application of default uncertainty factors for a specific life stage 
even if some databases are more robust than others as well as the use 
of life -stage specific studies to determine HIs for children exposed aft er 
birth (prepubertal database less robust).  + 
The overall cumulative risk of phthalates based on other adverse 
effects observed after exposure to this grouping as a whole regardless 
of chain length.  - 
+ = uncertainty with potential to cause over-estimation of exposure/risk, - = uncertainty with potential to cause under -
estimation of exposure risk, +/ - = unknown potential to cause over or under estimation of risk.  
Considering the above sources of uncertainty, it is anticipated that the cumulative risk 
characterization of this grouping would not be sensitive to refinement at this time if 
additional data were provided , as the lower -tiered HI approach with several 
conservative assumptions indicated no concern for human health.

  Conclusion  
Considering all available lines of evidence presented in this screening assessment, 
there is low risk of harm to the environment from the 14 phthalates in the Phthalate 
Substance Grouping (DMP, DIBP, CHIBP, BCHP, DCHP, DBzP, B79P, DMCHP, 
DIHepP, BIOP, B84 P, DINP, DIDP and DUP) . However, there is risk of harm to the 
environment from 1 additional phthalate, DEHP.  DEHP was previously assessed by 
Environment Canada and Health Canada in 1994 under the Priority Substances 
Assessment Program. The assessment concl uded that DEHP posed a risk to human 
health in Canada. However, a conclusion for the environment could not be determined 
because of insufficient information.  
It is conclude d that the 14  substances in the Phthalate Substance Grouping do not meet 
the criteria under paragraphs 64( a) or ( b) of CEPA as they are not entering the 
environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an 
immediate or long -term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity or 
that constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends . It is 
conclude d that DEHP meet s the criteria under paragraph 64( a) of CEPA as it is entering 
or may enter the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions th at 
have or may have an immediate or long -term harmful effect on the environment or its 
biological diversity. However, it is conclude d that DEHP do es not meet the criteria under 
paragraph 64( b) of CEPA as it is not entering the environment in a quantity or 
concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger to the 
environment on which life depends.  
On the basis of the information presented in this screening assessment, it is concluded  
that the 14 phthalates in the Phthalate Substance  Grouping do not meet the criteria 
under paragraph 64 (c) of CEPA as they  are not entering the environment in a quantity 
or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in 
Canada to human life or health.  
Therefore, it is conclude d that DEHP meet s one or more of the criteria set out in section 
64 of CEPA. DEHP has been determined to not meet the persistence or 
bioaccumulation criteria as set out in the Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations  
of CEPA.

Note : Models are based on fragment addition methods (i.e., they rely on the structure of the chemical) and typically 
accept only the neutral (i.e., non -ionized) form of a chemical as input (in SMILES for m). Where more than one 
appropriate model was available for a given property, the mean value was taken as the key value for that parameter. 
The selected key values for water solubility, vapour pressure, log K ow, log K aw and log K oa were  derived using a least -
squares adjustment procedure (Cole and Mackay 2000; Schenker et al. 2005) and represent internally consistent 
partitioning properties considering thermodynamic constraints.

Figure B -1. Phthalate contributions to total toxic units based on narcosis  
[Long Description: This figure is a line graph showing the relative contribution of the 
various phthalates to the total toxic units. Each of the 28 phthalates is listed along the 
x-axis, in decreasing order of their internal toxic units. The y -axis shows the internal 
toxic units and ranges from zero to 0.2 toxic units. The substance BBP is listed first as it 
accounts for the largest toxic unit, at 0.099. The next substance is DIOP, w hich 
accounts for 0.015 toxic units. Moving to the right, each phthalate accounts for 
successively smaller toxic units such that the curve appears to plateau at about 0.18 for 
the last half of the substances. ] 
Eleven  phthalates account for approximately 95% of cumulative risk based on narcosis. 
Total Internal Toxic Units were calculated as 0.18, or about 0.2.

Step 3:  Calculate the sum of FUEs.  
I. DBP: FUEs for MnBP and MHBP ar e 0.84 and 0.069, respectively. Therefore, 
the sum would be 0.91 (P4 and MIREC -CD Plus) and the FUE for only MnBP 
is 0.84 (MIREC).  
II. DEHP: FUEs are MEHP (0.073), MEOHP (0.15), MEHHP (294), MCMHP 
(0.038) and MECPP (0.21). Therefore, the sum of all 5 metabolit es would be 
0.71 (P4 and MIREC -CD Plus) and the sum of the first 3 would be 0.46 
(MIREC).  
Step 4 : Compute the daily intake using Equation 1.  
 
CHMS  
Statistical analysis:  The data were analyzed with SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) and 
SUDAAN 10.0.1 softwa re (RTI International, USA). Variance estimates were produced 
using bootstrap weights, taking into account the 11 degrees of freedom for cycle 1 and 
13 degrees of freedom for cycle 2 as suggested in CHMS data user guide  (Statistics 
Canada 2011 , 2012) . All analyses were weighted using the CHMS cycle 1 survey 
weights (phthalates sub -sample) and CHMS cycle 2 survey weights (environmental 
urine subsample) in order to be representative of the Canadian population. Phthalate 
concentrations that were below LO D were assigned a value of LOD/2.  
Estimation of creatinine excretion rate (CER):  For each study , participant creatinine 
excretion rate was calculated using the Mage equations (from (15)). The adiposity 
adjustment (discussed in the supplemental information (15)) was applied for all 
participants , and the body surface area adjustment was applied for children under the 
age of 18. Median BMIs by age fo r the adiposity adjustment were computed using the 
entire CHMS sample. The CHMS phthalate subsample dataset had 174 children who 
exceeded the height limits in the Mage equations (186 cm for males and 172 cm for 
females). The Mage equations were applied dir ectly to the observed heights in order to 
extrapolate creatinine excretion rates for these participants. The predicted excretion 
rates for these individuals appeared to be reasonable despite the extrapolation.    
198 Estimation of urinary excretion rate:  For ea ch selected phthalate, the urinary excretion 
rate was calculated using CER as follows  
𝑈𝐸𝑅  (µ𝑔𝑘𝑔 𝐵𝑊/𝑑𝑎𝑦 ) ⁄ = 𝑈𝐶𝐶𝑟 ( µ𝑔
𝑔 𝐶𝑟) ×𝐶𝐸𝑅  (𝑔
𝑑𝑎𝑦)
𝐵𝑊  (𝑘𝑔)         Equation 1  
UER is the body -weight adjusted urinary excretion rate. The UC Cr is the creatinine -
adjusted urinary phthalate concentration , and BW refers to the body -weight. The UER 
for individual participants were computed and used in the regression model (see below) 
to derive  least square geometric mean  (LSGM ) estimates of UER for the Cana dian 
population.  
Daily intake estimation:  The daily intake of each phthalate was estimated for each 
participant using the following equations (David et al. 2000; Koch et al. 2007):  
𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦  𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒  (µ𝑔𝑘𝑔 𝐵𝑊 /𝑑𝑎𝑦 ) ⁄ = 𝑈𝐸𝑅  (µ𝑔
𝑑𝑎𝑦  ×𝑘𝑔 𝐵𝑊)
𝐹𝑈𝐸 × 𝑀𝑊 𝐷
𝑀𝑊 𝑀    Equation 2  
The fractional urinary excretion (FUE) is defined as the fraction of the diester exposure 
dose excreted as monoesters in urine, calculated on mole -basis. For the daily intake 
estimations, previous works used  FUE values of 0.73, 0.44, and 0.69 for BBP, DEHP, 
and DBP respectively (19, 21, 25; Koch et al. 2012) . MW D and MW M are the molecular 
weights of the diester (312.36, 390.56, and 278.34 g/mole for BBP, DEHP, and DBP  
respectively) and the monoester (256.22, 865.02, and 222.24 g/mole for BBP, 
MEHP+MEHHP+MEOHP, and MBP) respectively.  
For each selected phthalate diester, the daily intake for each study participants was 
computed using equation 2. Arithmetic and geometric means and selected percentiles 
along with their 95% confidence intervals of daily intake were produced for the 
Canadian population by age groups, sex and fasting status. Descriptive statistics were 
computed using SUDAAN proc DESCRIPT and SAS proc SURVEYREG .

b Infants 0  – 6 months assumed to ingest 0.742 litre breast milk/day (USEPA, 2011).  No data were identified on the 
levels of DINP in breast milk.  The P4 study, also reported non detection of the monoester MINP.  
c Formula -fed infants are assumed to have an intake rate of 0.75 kg of formula per day.   DINP is present in 5 of 32 
infant formula samples (range ND – 0.590 ppm, Personal communication FD, HC  to ESRAB, HC , April 2014 )

estimates (food) for  the > 71 years  age group , as presented in Table 9-2, were used to represent dietary intake for 
this age group.  
i Health Canada (2017)  measured DINP in 51 homes in Toronto and Ottawa, ON, Canada . Median (0.0 12 µg/m3) and 
maximum ( 2.0 µg/m3) concentrations were used in exposure characterization.   
j Probabilistic intakes (median and 90th) were incorporated into dietary intake table for comparison purposes.  Intakes 
and methodology are outlined in Appendix D (see also Table 9 -2).  Note gender and age groups do not match fully; 
therefore the highest intake from within an age group was inputted into the table: e.g., Female intakes (>71 years)  
208 were inputted into the 60+ (un isex) column because this age group had the highest intake of all the groups in the 51 – 
71 year range.  N/A notates significant variation therefore estimates not presented  
k The ingestion of indoor dust is considered a significant source of indoor exposure to Phthalates, including DINP,and 
the amount of indoor dust ingested each day is based on Wilson et al. (2013). The median (112 ug/g) and 95th (527 
ug/g) percentile concent rations of DINP identified in indoor dust were used for exposure characterization (Kubwabo et 
al. 2013). 
  
209 Appendix E. Derivation of dietary intakes  
Occurrence Data – DINP, DIDP, DMP, DIBP, DCHP, BBP, DBP, DEHP and DnHP  
Phthalate occurrence data from the 2 013 Canadian Total Diet Study (TDS) were 
prioritized for estimating dietary exposures. This dataset was determined to be the most 
comprehensive Canadian survey on the occurrence of phthalates in foods , and results 
were available for DiBP, BBP, DBP, and DEH P. For other phthalates, occurrence data 
in food were first taken from the 2013 -2014 and 2014 -2015 Food Safety Action Plan 
(FSAP) surveys conducted by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and/or 
from a Total Diet Study conducted in the United States (US; Schecter et al. 2013), 
considering the similarity between samples analyzed  in these studies and products 
available on the Canadian market. Occurrence data in foods that were not covered by 
the CFIA or the U.S. TDS datasets were supplemented by data fr om a British Total Diet 
Study (Bradley et al. 2013 b). Note that these data were only used to fill data gaps and 
that duplicate occurrence data from the British TDS for a given food or phthalate were 
not included if such data were already available from the  CFIA or the U.S. TDS 
datasets.  
Results for phthalates in food that were reported as less than the analytical limit of 
detection (LOD) were assigned values of ½LOD. However, a value of 0 (zero) was 
assigned to all samples within a broad food category when no phthalates were detected 
above the LOD in any sample in that category.  
The following table indicates the source(s) of occurrence data used to derive dietary 
exposu re estimates for each phthalate.

Note:  DINP and DIDP intakes were unchanged from those presented in the SOS 
report.  DIBP was monitored in Health Canada’s 2013 TDS (Cao et al . 2015) however,  
210 intakes using this new data showed no signicant changes.  For DCHP and DMP, the 
2013  TDS data showed low detection frequencies; therefore, previous intake estimates 
are still presented in this screening assessment.    
Food c onsumption data and matching to occurrence data  
The phthalate concentrations in individual foods were matched to consumption figures 
for these foods from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) on nutrition 
(Statistics Canada 2004) to generate distributions of phthalate exposure for various 
age-sex groups. The CCHS included 24 -hour dietary recall information for over 35,000 
respondents of all ages across Canada.  
Body w eight information  
For the purpose of determining per kilogram body weight exposure estimates, infant (0  
to 1 year old) body weigh ts were set to the mean body weights as derived from the body 
weight data from the United States Department of Agriculture Continuing Survey of 
Food Intakes by Individuals (1994 -96 and 1998). For all other age groups, body weights 
reported in the CCHS, whe ther measured or self -reported, were used  and where 
missing were imputed using the median for the corresponding age -sex group and 
quintile of energy intake.  
Probabilistic exposure a ssessment  
For each food consumed by a respondent in the CCHS, phthalate con centrations were 
randomly selected from the matching list of assayed values. For each individual 
respondent, exposure estimates from each food were summed, generating a distribution 
of exposure for all respondents. This was repeated 500 times (500 iteratio ns) to model 
the variability of the distribution of exposures because of the variability of the phthalates 
levels. For each age -sex group, the median and 90 th percentile exposures were derived 
from the empirical distribution generated by the 500 iterations .
