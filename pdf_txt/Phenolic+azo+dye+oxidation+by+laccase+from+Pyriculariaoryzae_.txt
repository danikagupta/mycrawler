The kinetics of laccase-catalyzed transformation of the
azo-dye Diamond Black PV 200 (CI Mordant Black 9)
and various related synthesized derivatives were ana-lyzed for dependence on pH and substrate structure. Thereaction mixture of Diamond Black PV 200 was analyzed
by HPLC/MS
/C1/MS and it was shown that upon laccase
oxidation, reactive chinoid fragments of lower molecularweight were formed. These may further oligomerize asindicated by the appearance of a number of compounds
with increased molecular weight. The pH optimum for
the decolorization was pH 5 for Diamond Black PV 200which did not change significantly when the substitu-tion pattern of its basic structure was varied. Biodegrad-
ability, however, was strongly dependent on the
structure of the dyes.

INTRODUCTION
Excess dyestuff in process water is highly undesir-
able because of environmental concerns. Due to theirchemical structure, dyes are highly recalcitrant andoften toxic or can lead to toxic transformationproducts when released into the environment.Therefore, their complete mineralisation is desired.
Various physical and chemical methods for the
elimination of dyestuff have been developed duringthe past decades. However, they all inevitably causehigh consumption of chemicals and energy (Slokarand Le Marechal, 1998; Robinson et al ., 2001).
Biotechnological approaches are gaining increas-
ing interest in the textile industry (Cavaco-Paulo andGu¨ bitz, 2004). Bioremediation techniques for textilewastewater are currently evolving as promising
sustainable alternatives (Binkley and Kandelbauer,
2003; Kandelbauer and Gu ¨ bitz, in press) and a huge
number of microbial systems, both, aerobic andanaerobic have been described in this context(McMullan et al., 2001; Stolz 2001). Fungi, with their
ligninolytic enzyme systems are also being applied
in the biological decolorization of textile dyestuff(Martins et al., 2003; Kapdan and Kargi, 2002; Fu and
Viraraghavan 2001). Besides adsorption onto fungal
mycelia and merely removing dyestuff physicallyfrom the effluent (Sumathi and Manju, 2000), oxida-tive biodegradation takes place upon action of
enzymes such as peroxidases and laccases (Wesen-
berg et al . 2003).
Laccase ( p-diphenol oxidase, EC1.10.3.2) catalyzes
the oxidation of phenolic compounds and aromatic
amines and accepts a broad range of substrates
(Claus, 2004; Thurston, 1994). The number of sub-strates can further be extended by using laccase incombination with mediators (Reyes et al ., 1999).
Laccase requires only molecular oxygen as a cosub-
strate which is concomittantly reduced to water. Thismakes it very interesting for use in enzyme-basedbioreactors (Kandelbauer et al., 2004; Peralta-Zamora
et al ., 2003).
Laccases have been used over the past two
decades for the elimination of aromatic compoundsin various types of effluents (Bollag et al ., 1988;
Bajpai et al ., 1993; Majcherczyk et al ., 1998; D’Anni-
bale et al ., 1999). Until now, laccases from many
different fungi such as Trametes versicolor (Wong and
Yu, 1999), Trametes hirsuta (Abadulla et al ., 2000;

Pyricularia oryzae (Chivukula and Renganathan,

been described for the decolorization of a widestructural variety of dyes.
However, although a large number of structurally
diverse dyes can be successfully oxidized by lac-
cases, decolorizations take place at different ratesand to different extents and many dyes are notdegraded at all (Kandelbauer et al ., 2004). Little
information is available concerning the substratespecifities of laccases. One key parameter for thedescription of the structure /C1
/biodegradability rela-
tionship has been identified as the redox-potential of
the substrates (Xu, 1996; Xu et al ., 2000). Although
chemometrical methods have been employed inorder to classify dyes according to their biodegrad-ability (Suzuki et al ., 2001), no generally valid
models have been deduced so far. However, gaininginsights in the degradation pathways of dyes and thestructural requirements for biodegradability is im-portant (Gu ¨ bitz et al ., in press) in order to optimize
potential bioremediation systems for industrial tex-
tile process water treatment.
In order to extend current knowledge about
structure /C1
/reactivity relationships in laccase-cata-
lyzed azo-dye decolorization, a number of structu-rally related model azo-dyes have been synthesizedand their kinetics with respect to laccase-catalyzedoxidation was analyzed. Their common structural
feature was based on the commercial azo-dye
Diamond Black PV 200 (CI Mordant Black 9, IV)
which was shown to be readily biodegradable usinglaccase (Kandelbauer et al., 2004). Reaction products
of enzymatic Diamond Black PV 200 oxidation wereanalyzed in more detail using HPLC/MS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ChemicalsDiamond Black PV 200 (CI Mordant Black 9, IV) was
kindly donated by DyeStar (Frankfurt, Germany)and was used for screening experiments without anyfurther purification. For kinetic measurements thedye was purified by silica gel column chromatogra-phy. The diazo components 4-aminonaphthalinesulfonic acid, 3-aminobenzene sulfonic acid, 3-ami-no-4-hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid, 3-amino-4-
hydroxy-5-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid and coupling
compound 1,5-dihydroxynaphthaline (analyticalgrade) were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-disulfonic acid) dia-mmonium salt (ABTS), citric acid, sodium azide,and the HPLC solvents methanol and water were
also from Sigma.
Biocatalyst and Enzyme Activity
Laccase production by Trametes modesta was essen-
tially as already described (Nyanhongo et al ., 2002).
After ten days of cultivation on PDA petri plates,mycelial mats (1 cm
2) were cut and used to prepare
liquid precultures for subsequent inoculation oflarger scale production vessels. The basal mediaconsisted of glucose (1 g L
/C281), yeast extract (1.5 g
L/C281), KH 2PO 4(2.5 g L/C281), (NH 4)2SO4(1 g L/C281),
Na 2HPO 4(2.5 g L/C281), MgSO 4/C215/7H 2O( 4gL/C281), and
trace elements. Supplements of copper chloride(100 mg L
/C281) and wheat bran flakes (20 g L/C281)
were added as laccase inducers (Kandelbauer et al .,
2003; Pickard et al ., 1999). The pH was adjusted to
pH 3.7 prior to autoclaving. After two days offermentation in an aerated stirred tank reactor, the
laccase was harvested and further processed as
described in Kandelbauer et al . (2003). Enzyme
activity of the dialyzed biocatalyst solutions wasassayed using the laccase-catalyzed oxidationof ABTS (molar extinction coefficient o
M/C30 /43.2
mM/C281cm/C281) following the increase in absorbance
at 420 nm.
Preparation of Model Dyes
The structurally related model azo-dyes 1,5-
dihydroxy-2-naphthylazo-3 ?-sulfonic acid ( I), 1,5-
dihydroxy-2-phenylazo-4 ?-sulfonic acid ( II), 1,5-di-
hydroxy-2-phenylazo-3 ?-sulfonic acid ( III), and
1,5-dihydroxy-2-(2 ?-hydroxy-3 ?-nitro)phenylazo-5 ?-
sulfonic acid ( V) (see Fig. 1) were prepared as
follows. 12.5 mmol of the diazo components weredissolved in three equivalents of 16% hydrochloricacid. After cooling the solution to about /C28
/108C
using a salt/ice mixture (1:3), 5 mL of 2.5 M sodium
nitrite solution were slowly added under stirring.
The diazotated product was subsequently added to astirred basic dispersion of the coupling component1,5-dihydroxynaphthaline in 25 mL of 2 M sodiumhydroxide solution. The precipitated dye was recrys-tallized and dried.
Purity of Azo-dyes
Concentrations of the azo compounds present in the
synthesized dye preparations, as well as the purifiedDBPV were confirmed via redox titration of known
amounts of dye with sodium dithionite under
anaerobic conditions according to the modifiedmethod of Bechtold et al . (2001). The decrease in
absorbance at the absorbance maximum l
maxof the
respective dye was followed spectrophotometrically.332 A. KANDELBAUER et al.The initial decay rate was determined by linear
regression and extrapolated for zero absorbance.Sodium dithionite was calibrated with iodine/po-tassium iodide standard solutions.
HPLC/MS Analysis
Dyes and their transformation products were sepa-
rated in a Dionex HPLC system (Dionex Corpora-tion, Sunnyhill, Calif.) consisting of a P580 pump, an
ASI-100 automated sample injector, and a PDA-100
photodiode array UV/Vis detector. Separationwas performed through a Hypersil ODS 5- mm
(250/C29
/4 mm [inside diameter]) column. The follow-
ing operating conditions were used for all analyses:injection volume, 20 mL; the mobile phase was
methanol/citrate buffer pH 7.5 (55/45); flow rate
was 0.9 mL min/C281. The HPLC was connected to a SL
ion trap mass spectrometer (1100 Series LC/MSDTrap, Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped withan electrospray ionization source. The spectra wererecorded in negative ionization mode. Full-scanspectra were collected from 100 to 800 m/z, with
a capillary temperature of 350 8C. The nebulizer
was set to 483 kpascal, the dry gas was set to
12.00 L min
/C281, and the HV capillary was set to
3,000 V . Extracted ion chromatograms were obtainedby selecting ions e.g. [M /C28
/H]/C28at 359 m/z(for
Diamond Black PV 200, IV). MS/C1/MS fragmentation
patterns of interesting ions were recorded andinterpreted.
Diamond Black PV 200 Transformation
For the analysis of the transformation products of
the parent dye, Diamond Black PV 200, 0.56 g L
/C281of
commercial IVwere dissolved in 20 mL 100 mM
citrate buffer at pH 5.0. Dye transformation was
started at room temperature by addition of 100 nkatmL
/C281laccase. After 3 hours, 200 mL of 0.1 mM
sodium azide solution were added to the reactionmixture in order to stop the reaction by enzymeinhibition. The solutions were analyzed by HPLC/MS as described above.
Dye Decolorization Kinetics
The kinetic profiles for all azo-dyes ( ItoV) were
determined using dye concentrations from 0.01 to1.5 mM in 25 mL of total reaction volume. The pHoptima were determined using citrate buffer at pHs
varying from pH 3 and pH 7 as the reaction
medium. All decolorizations were carried out atroom temperature (25 8C).
After taking a zero sample, decolorization was
started by the addition of laccase. Laccase concen-trations were chosen appropriately and the calcu-lated rates were then normalized to the amount ofenzyme used. Samples (100 mL) were withdrawn at
regular time intervals, the first five samples being
withdrawn every 30 seconds with these intervalsbeing increased as the reaction proceeded fromevery minute to every five, ten and fifteen minutesuntil the reaction was finished. The samples weretransferred to HPLC vials containing 100 mLo f
0.1 mM sodium azide in 300 mL citrate buffer which
immediately caused the reaction to stop by inhibi-
tion of the enzyme. The samples were subsequently
analyzed by HPLC. For UV/Vis spectroscopic detec-tion, the dye absorbance maxima were used as givenin Table II. The initial rates were determined fromthe decrease in the chromatographic peaks by linearNOH

RESULTS
Transformation of Diamond Black PV 200
Initially, a commercial preparation of Diamond Black
PV 200 ( IV) was subjected to laccase-catalyzed
oxidation at pH 5. The dye was readily decolorized,as illustrated by the spectral time course of the vis-
spectra depicted in Fig. 3. Although the absorbance
maximum at 530 nm had decreased to about 10% of
the original signal after three hours, the reactionmixture was not completely decolorized but still hada brownish hue. In order to clarify the nature of theformed coloured products HPLC/MS /C1
/MS analysis
of the final reaction mixture was performed.
Mass spectral analysis
HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture indicated thepresence of at least nine products ( R
tof 1.18, 1.67,
5.40, 5.70, 5.99, 6.32, 6.53, 7.23, 7.26, and 7.50 min).
The buffer compound citric acid was found to
elute first ( Rt/C30 /1.18 min) and was positively identi-
fied ([M /C28 /H]/C28/C30 /191; [2M /C27 /Na/C27 /2H]/C28/C30 /405).
The compound with Rtof 5.40 was positively
identified as the undegraded Diamond Black PV byits mass spectrum (359 m/z). Comparison with the
fragmentation pattern of the untreated dye showedthe same three major signals: 279 m/z(loss of
sulfonate group), 186 m/z(loss of sulfonated phenyl
of mass 171; 171 m/z(complementary fragment).
The compound eluted after 5.99 minutes was
identified as the acetylated Diamond Black deriva-tive (401 m/z) as indicated by the additional
splitting of 43 m/zfragments but otherwise very
similar mass spectrum compared to the DiamondBlack PV 200 fragmentation pattern. The same peak
was also present in the original dye chromatogram.
Upon laccase treatment, no decrease in the inte-
grated peak area at R
t5.99 was detected indicating
that the acetylated dye is not attacked by the laccase.We assume that the dye was acetylated in thenaphtylring since the MS /C1
/MS showed the loss of a
171m/zfragment both from the signal at 401 m/z
and at 358 m/z. The substitution was most likely at
the ortho -hydroxy group next to the azobond in
order to exhibit the inhibitory effect towards enzy-matic oxidation.
Mass spectral analysis of the chromatographic
peak with R
t/C30 /3.78 revealed a compound of smaller
molecular weight (187 m/z) than the dye. One likely
structure is given in Fig. 2 ( VII).
The main Diamond Black transformation product
was found at Rt5.70 and had a molecular mass of
388m/z. The secondary mass spectrum (focused on
388m/z) yielded three main peaks at 388 m/z, 308,
280 with decreasing signal intensity, indicating thatTABLE I HPLC/MS analysis of the laccase-catalyzed oxidation of Diamond Black PV

MS fragmentation pattern is indicated in VI.334 A. KANDELBAUER et al.the transformation product is relatively stable and
first looses a sulfonate group before subsequentlymolecular nitrogen N
2is eliminated. The fragment
with 280 m/zfurthermore looses water (262 m/z)
and both of the latter fragments split off a fragmentwith 91 m/z. Based on these findings, we propose
for the transformation product at R
t5.70 the struc-
ture given in Fig. 2 ( VI).
The mass spectrum of the compound at Rt6.32 (of
468m/z) showed that it contained no sulfonic acid
group since no fragment of 80 m/zwas split off.
Since the molecular weight had nevertheless in-creased, we assume that it must be some recombina-
tion product from the radicals formed after laccase-
catalyzed oxidation.
The secondary mass spectrum of the com-
pound eluting after 6.53 ( /C30
/452 m/z) showed a
very similar fragmentation pattern to the compoundwith 388 m/z. Again, loss of molecular nitrogen and
sulfonate is found but in the reverse order, indicat-ing that the heterocyclic ring is less stable than in theformer case. It is also formed to a much lower extentas indicated by the much lower signal from theHPLC chromatogram. Here again, a mass fragment
with of 91 m/zis split off and the elimination of
water. Although no definite structure can be given,its structure must be closely related to that shown inFig. 2 ( VI).
Mass spectral analysis of the components with
higher retention times ( R
t/C30 /7.23, 7.26, and 7.50)
showed an increase in molecular weight uponlaccase action with the largest fragments found at715, 717, and 726 m/z, respectively. The secondary
mass spectra focused on 715 and 717 m/z, respec-
tively, yielded again fragmentation patterns similar
to the compound found with 388 m/z. After split-
ting off sulfonate and molecular nitrogen, a massfragment of 109 m/zleft the molecules, which can
be assigned to a hydroxylated derivative of the
phenoxy fragment with 91 m/z(see Fig. 2, VII).
The compounds both contain another sulfonategroup and both loose also a non-hydroxylatedphenoxy fragment (91 m/z). However, the complete
elucidation of the structures for these higher mole-cular weight compounds was not possible. Theywere present only in minor quantities ( B
/2%).
Kinetics of transformation of Diamond Black PV
200Subsequent kinetic studies for the determination ofpH and dye concentration effects were performedusing a chromatographically purified preparation of(IV). The chromatographic purification was done
since the acetylated derivative, found in the com-mercial preparation, is not susceptible to laccase
attack.
Kinetic analysis of Diamond Black PV ( IV) trans-
formation was based on the analysis of the decreas-ing peak area for the dye at R
t/C30 /5.4 min. Plots of the
initial rates vs. initial dye concentrations for differentpH-values are shown in Fig. 4. The continuous linewas calculated from the non-linear curve fit basedon Michaelis /C1

account substrate inhibition) and approximates the
measured data points quite well. The correspondingapparent constants K

to calculate specifity constants kcat, dye , which are de-
picted in Fig. 5 in dependence of the pH.
Highest reaction rates with Diamond Black PV
(IV) were achieved at pH 5. At this pH, also the most
pronounced inhibition effects were found. The

Substrate Specificity of Laccase
The substrate specificity of Trametes modesta laccase
towards azo-dyes was further studied using thetransformation of structurally closely related com-pounds based on IV. Similar to ( IV), kinetic studies
of the model dyes ( I,II,III, and V) were based on
the analysis of decreasing peak areas for the variouseluted dyes as revealed from HPLC separation. Alldyes were freshly synthesized and used after recrys-tallization. The UV/Vis spectral time courses duringdecolorization of the model azo-dyes were similar tothe DBPV spectrum (data not shown). The modifica-tion of the basic structure lead to shifts of the
absorbance maxima towards longer wavelengths
(see Table II).
The pH optima for decolorization were also
similar to the optimum found for ( IV) between
pH 4 and 5. However, reactivities were generallymuch less. No enzymatic transformation at allwas observed for dyes ( II) and ( III) at pHs B

and/C21 /6. The oxidation rates of the various model
azo-dyes decreased in the order Diamond BlackPV 200 ( IV)/C21 /1,5-dihydroxy-2-(2 ?-hydroxy-3 ?-ni-

strate inhibition. The corresponding specificity con-stants, k

The nitro-substituted dye ( V) was transformed at
much lower rates as compared to ( IV). Derivatives
lacking a ortho -hydroxy group were much less
susceptible towards laccase action. The position ofsulfonate substituents in the phenyl ring had aminor effect on the biodegradability.
DISCUSSION
Diamond Black PV 200 Transformation
HPLC/MS analysis showed that the laccase-cata-
lyzed transformation of IVproduced very complex
mixtures of different reaction products. As one of the
main products, a compound of higher molecular
weight than the original dye was found. Secondarymass spectroscopy revealed structural fragmentsthat could possibly be explained by the structureVIshown in Fig. 2. Among the main transformation
products, the oxidized cleavage product sulfoben-zene-3,4-dichinone VII was found (Fig. 2). The
corresponding hydroxynaphthalines or naphthochi-
noid low-molecular weight compounds were not
detected as the complementary fragments of the azo-dye since but are likely to have undergone furtheroligomerization. This was suggested by compoundswith increased molecular weight which were foundin the MS /C1
/MS of minor reaction products with
higher retention times ( Rt/C21 /6 min). Since they lacked
the sulfonate fragmentation pattern and it is unlikely
that laccase induced any desulfonation, it is con-
cluded that mixed recombination reactions are notfavorable. Although the cleavage of aromatic ringshas been reported to take place upon laccase action(Claus et al., 2002; Duran and Esposito, 2000), we didTABLE II Results of the kinetic analysis

Diamond Black PV.
Laccases initially generate reactive radical species
which subsequently undergo further oxidationeither to cleavage or oligomerization products. It istherefore unlikely that all products found are directoxidation products of laccase. According to Chivu-kula and Renganathan (1995), the mechanism oflaccase mediated azo-dye decomposition proceeds
first via two sequential electron abstractions. This is
followed by an attack of the nucleophile water on theresulting resonance stabilized cation. Subsequently,breakdown of the dye molecule takes place con-comitantly with the release of one proton and onemolecule of N
2yielding chinoid aromatics and
transient hydroperoxides, respectively (Chivukulaand Renganathan, 1995). The resulting chinones and
radicals could undergo coupling reactions yielding
oligomeric and polymeric structures. The mainfunction of the laccase-catalyst thus consists ofoxidatively rendering the azo-dye more susceptibleto further nucleophilic attack and nitrogen is elimi-nated in molecular form.
By choosing appropriate reaction conditions it
should also be possible to shift the chemical equili-
bria between the enzymatically activated radical
species towards oligomerization reactions. Polymer-ization reactions using laccases have been describedearlier (e.g. Aktas et al ., 2001; Osiadacz et al ., 1999).
This type of reaction could be advantageously usedin laccase-catalyzed polymerization and precipita-tion of waste dyestuff.
Substrate Specificity
In order to study the influence of dye structure on
biodegradability, structurally related model azo-
dyes were synthesized. As the basic structure, theacid dye Diamond Black PV 200 (CI Mordant Black9,IV) was used since it is a very important industrial
dye. The pH optimum did not change significantlywhen the substitution pattern of the basic structureIV was varied, staying between pH 4 and 5.
Biodegradability, however, in terms of the rate of
laccase-catalyzed dye transformation was strongly
dependent on the structure of the dyes ( IV/C21
/V/C21 /
II/C21 /III: /I). In the series of the 3 ?-sulfophenyl-azo-
dyes III,IV, and V, the introduction of a hydro-
xygroup ( IV) enhanced the affinity of the enzyme for
the substrate by a factor of approx. 240. The nitro-group present in Vdiminished the susceptibility
towards oxidation, however, k
cat, dye forVwas still
more than 40 times greater than kcat, dye forIII.
Extending the p-electron system of IIIby ring
annelation ( I) did not result in any significant
improvement in reaction rates. However, if the 3 ?-
sulfogroup ( meta ,III) is shifted to the 4 ?-position(para ,II), the affinity of the enzyme for the dye may
be increased threefold. Although an effect of the
position of the sulfonate-group was observed, the
presence or absence of hydroxy groups in the ortho-
position to the azo-link predominantly governs
biodegradation behaviour.
In an earlier study with designed model azo-dyes
based on the azo-coupling of 1,5-dihydroxy-2-(2 ?-
hydroxy)-phenylazo-5 ?-sulfonic acid with differently
substituted anilines (Kandelbauer et al., 2004), it was
found that their common structural feature was not a
preferred laccase substrate. Their low overall reac-
tivity with laccase made it difficult to obtain accurate
quantitative results. Although each of the dyes
contained a hydroxyl group on the naphthyl ringin the ortho -position to the azo-linkage, the rates for
the most reactive derivatives, the ones substituted
with another ortho- hydroxy group in the phenylring,
were still about 10
5times slower than that for
oxidation of IV. The nitro-substituted dyes were
not accepted by the laccase and no decolorization
took place at all. The reason for this low overall
reactivity of our previous set of model azo-dyes
could possibly have been the presence of two
sulfonate groups on the naphthyl ring of thecoupling component, both of them in meta -positions
relative to the azo-bond. Sulfonate groups exhibit a
strong electron withdrawing effect and might have
been detrimental to the redox properties required by
the enzyme. The varying substitution pattern on thephenyl ring could not compensate for the low
reactivity probably resulting from the presence of
the sulfonic acid groups.
In a different study we found that the same set of
model azo-dyes was readily degraded by a reductive
enzyme system, a newly isolated azo-reductase from
the alkali and thermostable Bacillus sp. strain SF
(Maier et al., 2004). Obviously, reducing the electron
density at the azo-bond, which is deleterious for the
laccase-catalyzed process, renders the molecule
more susceptible towards enzymatic reduction.
The dihydroxy naphthyl core used for the model
dyes in the present study may have conferred
sufficient electron density to the molecules so that
even those unsubstituted in the phenyl ring were
still oxidized by laccase, albeit at very low rates. Thismade it possible with the present set of dyes to
determine and compare specificity constants for
differently substituted phenylazo compounds.
In the early mechanistic study by Chivukula and
Renganathan (1995), effects of the substitution pat-
tern of azo-dyes on their biodegradability were also
examined in terms of reaction rates. All their model
dyes carried a sulfo-group for solubility and ahydroxy group conferring the character of a laccase
substrate, both, in the para- positions of the respec-
tive phenylrings. They systematically varied theAZO-DYE DIAMOND BLACK PV AND OF SOME STRUCTURALLY RELATED DERIVATIVES 337substitution pattern introducing methyl, methoxy,
chloro, and nitro groups. Among the dyes tested,
only those with electron-rich methyl or methoxy
substituents were oxidized. Unsubstituted 4-(4 ?-sul-
fophenylazo)-phenol and its 2-chloro and 2-nitro
analogs were not oxidized. Obviously, one hydro-
xygroup in the para -position to the azo-bond in the
otherwise unsubstituted dye was not sufficient to
facilitate its oxidation. Azo-dyes sulfonated in the
meta -position or carrying a hydroxy-group in the
ortho -position to the azo-bond were not taken into
consideration.
Since then, to our knowledge little further infor-
mation regarding the structural requirements for
laccase oxidation has appeared in the literature. In
the majority of studies, whole cell systems were used
for decolorization of commercial (e.g. Moreira et al .,
2000; Rodriguez et al., 1999; Kim et al., 1995; Fu and
Viraraghavan, 2001 and references herein) or de-
signed dyes (e.g. Martins et al ., 2003, 2001; Spadaro
et al ., 1992) which complicates causal interpretation
of dye structural effects. Other studies published
more specifically on laccase-catalyzed decoloriza-
tions were restricted to different commercially avail-
able dyes (e.g. Peralta-Zamora et al., 2003; Abadulla
et al., 2000; Reyes et al., 1999) and demonstrate well
the wide applicability of laccases for dye remedia-
tion in general. However, due to the non-systematic
choice of dyestuff, they are of limited use for
deducing structure /C1/reactivity relationships.
Martins et al . (2001) reported earlier a positional
effect of sulfo-groups also using a set of structurally
closely related model azo-dyes. In their study,
4?-hydroxy-3 ?-methoxyphenylazobenzene-4-sulfonic
acid, carrying the sulfonic acid group in the para -
position to the azo-link was decolorized to a greater
extent (89%) than its meta- substituted analogue,
4?-hydroxy-3 ?-methoxyphenylazobenzene-3-sulfonic
acid (83%). However, the opposite result was foundwhen an additional methoxy-group was present in
the 5?-position. Unfortunately, only the overall deco-
lorization during incubation with the growing fun-
gus was assayed and no kinetic data were collected
that could directly be linked to enzymatic specifi-
cities. Since the authors gave no indication of the
enzymes involved in their model dye transforma-
tion, their findings are difficult to relate to our
present study.
In a study of Soares et al . (2002), four synthetic
model dyes of the diazo type were tested towards
decolorization by a purified laccase from Aspergillus
niger with and without redox mediators. Only one
dye contained a sulfonic acid group and was readily
transformed by the laccase. The three other dyes
were insoluble and therefore, not decolorized
by the free laccase in solution. According to the
authors the enzyme was inhibited by the presence ofethanol which was used for dye solubilisation. No
structural effects can be deduced from their set of
model dyes.
CONCLUSION
The laccase oxidative transformation of dyes de-
pends on their chemical structure. The presence ofortho -hydroxy groups with respect to the azolink
was found to enhance the decolorization rates ofazo-dyes with laccase whereas nitro groups stabi-lized the dye molecules against laccase action. The
biotransformation of Diamond Black PV 200, the dye
most susceptible to laccase, yielded both, cleavageand oligomerization products. Unlike mixed micro-bial cultures, laccases are not able to mineralize dyesbut produce complex mixture of different reactionproducts. Although enzyme remediation of dyestuffsuccessfully removes its color, a potentially harmfulorganic load may remain in the process waters.
Thus, an interesting future perspective in the appli-
cation of laccases for the treatment of waste dyestuff-containing process waters is the polymerization ofphenolic dye fragments rather than their oxidativebreakdown. If such polymerized fragments were ofsufficiently increased molecular weight they couldreadily be removed by a subsequent filtration step(laccase assisted dye precipitation). Consequently,
future research activities should focus on optimiza-
tion of the reaction conditions in order to achievemaximum oxidative coupling of primarily formeddye fragments. Together with introduction of sub-stitutents which enhance laccase catalysed decolor-ization this could lead to the design of novel‘‘biodegradible’’ dyes.
