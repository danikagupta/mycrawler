Introduction  
 
The discovery of man -made syntheti c dyes 
in late 19th century replaced the large -scale 
market for natural dyes. Azo dyes contribute 
to the largest proportion of total synthetic 
dyes consumed annually in various 
industries such as textile, paper printing, 
cosmetics, leather etc. due to its versatile 
color range, better color fastness and stable 
chemical structure  (He, Hu, & Li, 2004)  
(Asad, Amoozegar, Pourbabaee, Sarbolouki, 
& Dastghe ib, 2007) . Presence of electron 
withdrawing group in azo dyes makes them 
recalcitrant towards various   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
degradation processes (Singh, Singh, & 
Singh, 2014) . However, reductive 
degradation of azo dyes under certain 
conditions produces a class of pote ntially 
dangerous chemical substances referred to 
as aromatic amines. Hence azo dyes and 
their degradation products are known  for 
their toxic effect towards aquatic life, can be 
responsible for allergenic effects and are 
known to have carcinogenic and muta genic 
effects to living organisms (Babu, Parande, 
Raghu, & Kumar, 2007) (Dias, Bezerra, 
Lemos, & Pereira, 2003) (Nigam, Banat, International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences

Textile and other dye -stuff industries discharge various synthetic dyes into their 
effluent. The release of these synthetic dyes into the environment is a matter of 
concern due to the toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity and xenobiotic nature 
and causes serious pollution of soil, water & environment. The present study 
demonstrates the decolorization of three structurally different textile azo dyes (i.e. 
Reactive gr een-19 (RG -19). Remazol navy blue (RNB) and Reactive red -198 (RR -
198)) using the isolated strain  Enterococcus durans  GM13  from textile industry 
waste water. The acclimatized strain was capable of decolorizing all the dyes in a 
wide concentration range and maximum decolorization efficiency has been 
achieved with 100 mg/L dye concentration. At 100 mg/L dye concentration, the 
organism was capable of decolorizing 87% RG -19, 91.3% RNB and 92% RR -198 
dye within 24hr of incubation under static condition. Effect of  different physico -
chemical parameters on the decolorization efficiency of the isolated strain has been 
studied to achieve maximum decolorization efficiency. Biodegradation of the three 
model dyes were confirmed through UV -Vis spectral analysis.

 Singh, and Marchant, 1996) . Hence it 
becomes necessary to establish an efficient 
treatment method for the removal of toxic 
azo dyes from dye contaminated waste water 
before being released to the environment. 
Various physico -chemical methods for the 
treatment of these colored effluents 
practised till date have several drawbacks of 
being costly, inefficient color removal and 
production of secondary pollutant (Saratale, 
Saratale, Kalyani, Chang, & Govindwar, 
2009) . Biological treatment me thod of azo 
dye containing effluent using different 
microbial strains has been reported to be an 
effective and eco -friendly option by many 
researchers (K. C. Chen, Wu, Liou, & 
Hwang, 2003) (Jadhav, Dawkar, Ghodake, & 
Govindwar, 2008) . However, bacterial 
decolorization of azo dyes has been reported 
to be faster as compared to other biological 
method of treatment (Chang, Chen, & Lin, 
2004)(Kalyani, Telke, Dhanve, & Jadhav, 
2009) . 
 
Organisms isolated from dye  contaminated 
wastewater are believed to be more tolerant 
to high dye concentrations and can be used 
for the development of an effective 
bioprocess for the treatment of colored 
effluent. Current study deals with the 
decolorization of three different azo dy es 
using a bacterial strain isolated from textile 
industry wastewater.  
 
Dye decolorization efficiency of the isolated 
strain has been evaluated in a wide 
concentration range for all the three model 
dyes. Effect of different physico -chemical 
parameters on the decolorization efficiency 
of the strain has been studied to achieve 
maximum decolorization potential. 
Degradation of the dye chromophore was 
confirmed through UV -Vis spectral analysis 
for the three model dyes before and after 
decolorization.  
 Materials  and Methods  
 
Dyes and Chemicals  
 
Three different textile azo dyes Reactive 
green -19 (RG -19), Remazol navy blue 
(RNB), Reactive red -198 (RR -198) used in 
this study were purchased from a textile dye 
whole seller of Kolkata, India. Stock 
solutions of 10,000 mg/L concentration for 
the three model dyes were prepared and 
surface sterilised with 0.22 µm syringe 
filter. The desired concentrations of dye 
used in decolorization experiments were 
prepared by subsequent dilution of the stock 
solution. The structure and  absorption 
maxima of the model dyes were presented in 
Table -1. All the media components used for 
bacterial, isolation, preservation and 
decolorization studies were purchased from 
Himedia (Mumbai, India).  
 
Isolation, Screening and identification of 
dye dec olorizing microorganism  
 
Textile wastewater sample collected from 
Viwandi, Mumbai, India has been used as 
the source of dye degrading microorganism. 
Potent dye degrading bacterial strains were 
isolated by enrichment culture technique. 
1mL of textile waste water sample was 
inoculated to 100 mL of nutrient broth 
medium (Peptone 1g, Yeast extract 0.5g, 
NaCl 1g) containing mixture of three textile 
dye (RG -19, RNB & RR -198). After 48 hr 
of incubation at 30 ◦C under static condition, 
1 mL of cell suspension was t ransferred to 
nutrient medium containing higher 
concentration of dye, and the process was 
continued till complete decolorization of the 
medium has been observed. A small portion 
of the decolorized medium was then spread 
on nutrient agar plate containing mi xture of 
dye. After 48 hr of incubation at 30 ◦C, the 
organisms showing zone of decolorization 
were isolated and further screened based on Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2016) 5(7): 676-686 
677 
 their highest decolorization potential. The 
strain showing highest decolorization 
potential was designated as M1A and chosen 
for further studies. The strain was se nt to 
Xcelris labpvt. Ltd, Ahmedabad, India for 
16s rRNA identification.  
 
Decolorization Experiments  
 
Batch decolorization experiments were 
conducted to study the dye decolorization 
efficiency of M1A for the decolorization of 
three model dyes RG -19, RNB an d RR -198. 
All the decolorization experiments were 
performed in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks 
containing 100 mL of nutrient medium. 
Effect of different physico -chemical 
parameters affecting the decolorization 
efficiency of M1A has been studied by 
varying one fac tor at a time keeping the 
others constant with the basic conditions of 
temperature 32◦C, pH 7.2, dye concentration 
100 mg/L and 24hr of incubation period. 
Decolourization experiments were 
conducted at different incubation time, 
initial dye concentrations ( 100mg/L -1000 
mg/L), inoculum volume, aeration 
condition, incubation temperature (20◦C-
45◦C) and pH (5 -10). Extent of dye 
decolorization was monitored using UV -Vis 
spectrophotometer at the absorption maxima 
of the dyes under investigation. The 
percentage de colorization was calculated 
using the following equation.  
 
 
 
Results and Discussion  
 
Isolation, screening and identification of 
dye decolorizing bacterial isolate  
 
Dye decolorizing bacterial strains were 
isolated using serial dilution method based 
upon th eir ability to create clear zone in 
nutrient agar plate. A number of strains were isolated and further screened to select 
isolates showing highest dye decolorizing 
ability. On repeated screening, one strain 
showing highest dye decolorization potential 
was selected and was designated as M1A. 
16s rRNA based identification result of the 
isolate revealed that, the strain M1A has 
maximum similarity with Enterococcus 
durans  GM13 (GenBank Accession 
Number: KC213474.1) based on nucleotide 
homology and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 
1, Table -2). 
 
Effect of incubation time  
 
Biological decolorization of dyes is highly 
dependent on the incubation time as growth 
and metabolic rate of different bacteria 
varies with time. Decolourization of all the 
three model dyes by the i solated bacterial 
strain was recorded at different time 
intervals (Figure 2). The results showed that, 
M1A has achieved its maximum 
decolorization potential within 24 hr of 
incubation for all the three model dyes. 
Initially up to 10hr of incubation, a rapi d 
decolorization efficiency has been observed 
which may contributes to the log phase 
when rapid metabolic rate and growth of 
microorganisms helped in fast reduction of 
dye chromophore.  
 
Within 24hr of incubation M1A was able to 
achieve 86.56% decolorizati on of RG -19 
dye, 91.08% decolorization of RNB and 
92.23% decolorization of RR -198 at 32◦C 
under static condition with 100 mg/L of dye 
concentrations and 5% inoculum volume.  
 
The difference in percentage decolorization 
for three different dyes may be due t o the 
difference in their structures. As maximum 
decolorization has been achieved within 
24hr of incubation, rest of the studies were 
carried out taking this constant incubation 
time.  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2016) 5(7): 676-686

 Effect of inoculum volume  
 
In batch process where organisms grow in a 
fixed amount of nutrient, inoculum volume 
becomes an important factor affecting the 
overall efficiency of the process. Small 
inoculum volume slows down the overall 
rate of biological reaction which leads to 
decrease in rate of dye decolorization. 
However, i noculum volume larger than the 
optimum value results in early depletion of 
nutrient and microorganisms attain the death 
phase which leads to decrease in dye 
decolorization rate. Figure 3 depicts the 
change in the extent of dye decolorization of 
all the thr ee model dyes in response to 
varying inoculums size of M1A. An increase 
in decolorization percentage has been 
observed with increase in inoculum volume 
from 1% (v/v) to 5% (v/v). However, with 
further increase in inoculum volume leads to 
decrease in decolo rization efficiency of 
M1A strain for all the three model dyes. 
This may be due to early depletion of 
nutrient which leads to decreased metabolic 
rate, hence decolorization efficiency found 
to be reduced.  
 
Effect of aeration condition  
 
Aeration condition h as a tremendous impact 
on azo dye decolorization capacity of the 
bacterial strains. Figure 4 depicts the color 
removal efficiency of the M1A under static, 
anaerobic and shaking condition. The strain 
M1A showed maximum decolorization both 
in static and anae robic condition, however 
under shaking condition, a sharp decrease in 
decolorization efficiency has been observed. 
Most of the bacterial dye decolorization 
process of azo dyes prefers anaerobic 
environment as in anaerobic condition azo 
group of the dye act s as the electron 
acceptor from the reduced electron carrier 
i.e. NADH, quinones etc. and gets reduced  
(Wuhrmann, Mechsner, & Kappele r, 
1980) (Banat, Nigam, Singh, & Marchant, 1996)  (Chen et al ., 2003) . Similarly under 
static incubati on condition, oxygen transfer 
is limited to the broth surface only and the 
cell cultures sediment in the bottom of the 
flasks and becomes oxygen depleted (Stolz, 
2001) (Chen, 2002)  which favours 
degradation of azo dyes. However, if the 
extra -cellular environment is aerobic 
(shaking condition), this reduction 
mechanism get s inhibited by oxygen, as the 
oxidation of the reduced redox mediator is 
mediated by oxygen rather than by the azo 
dye(Pearce, Lloyd, & Guthrie, 2003) . 
Similar findings were reported by  many 
researchers where static and anaerobic 
conditions favour the reductive 
decolorization of azo dye molecule using 
different bacterial species (Ghodake, Jadhav, 
Tamboli, Kagalkar, & Govindw ar, 2011)  
(Tripathi & Srivastava, 2011)  (Singh et al ., 
2014) . 
 
Effect of dye concentration  
 
Concentration of dye is supposed to be an 
importa nt parameter which can influence the 
decolorization efficiency of an organism. 
Higher dye concentrations can be toxic to 
microorganisms which may affect the 
microbial metabolism and growth, hence 
their decolorization efficiency gets affected. 
A wide range of concentration of the three 
model dyes were chosen to study the 
tolerance level and dye decolorization 
capacity of the isolated strain M1A. Our 
isolated strain M1A was found to be highly 
efficient in decolorizing the three model 
dyes (RG -19, RNB and RR -198) in all the 
tested concentrations of dyes (Figure 5). 
Highest decolorization has been achieved 
with 100 mg/L of dye concentration, at 
which 87.01%, 91.3% and 92% 
decolorization has been obtained for RG -19, 
RNB and RR -198 dye respectively. 
However, a dec rease in dye decolorization 
efficiency was observed as the dye 
concentration increased from 100 mg/L to Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2016) 5(7): 676-686 
679 
 1000 mg/L. A decrease in dye 
decolorization efficiency with increase in 
dye concentration may be due to the 
increasing toxic effect of dye and its 
degra dation metabolites which affects the 
overall efficiency of the organism.  
 
Effect of temperature  
 
Incubation temperature plays an important 
role in microbial growth and activity. It is 
one of the vital parameter taken into 
consideration for the optimization  of any 
kind of bioremediation process. Batch 
decolorization experiments were performed 
at different temperature levels ranging from 
20◦C to 45 ◦C for assessing optimal 
decolorization capacity of isolated strain 
M1A. A gradual increase in decolorization 
activity of M1A was observed with increase 
in temperature from 20 ◦C to 35 ◦C (Figure 
6), showing maximum decolorization 
efficiency at 35 ◦C. At this optimum 
temperature the strain showed maximum 
decolorization of 87.78%, 94.23% and 
95.5% for RG -19, RNB and RR-198 
respectively.   
 
However, a sharp decrease in color removal 
efficiency was observed as the temperature 
increased beyond 40 ◦C for all the three 
model dyes. The reduction in decolorization 
efficiency at higher temperature may be 
attributed to loss of cell viability or 
deactivation of enzyme activity (Saratale, 
Saratale, Chang, & Govindwar, 2011) . 
Madhuri et al., (2014) reported that 
Enterococcus sp. showed maximum 
decolorization of sulfonated diazo dye C.I. 
Direct Red 81 in the temperature range of 
30-40◦C which supports our finding.  
 
Effect of pH  
 
The hydrogen ion concentration showed 
profound effect on metabolic activity of 
microorganisms. Textile waste water shows varying pH and mostly alkaline pH is 
maintained during the p rocessing as it favors 
the addition and substitution mechanism 
between the cotton fibers and azo dyes 
(Walters, A., Santillo, D., & Johnston, 
2005) . Decolourization efficiency of the 
isolated strain has been studied in  a wide 
range of pH from 5 -10 (Figure 7).  
 
The strain showed a good decolorization 
activity in a range pH 6 -pH 9 and the 
maximum decolorization efficiency of M1A 
was achieved at pH 8 within 24hr of 
incubation for all the three model dyes. 
Decolourization e fficiency found to be 
decreased substantially in higher acidic and 
alkaline conditions as extreme pH 
environment inhibits bacterial growth. 
Similar findings were reported by many 
researchers where the optimum range of pH 
for textile dye decolorization usin g different 
bacterial species lies between pH 6 to pH 
10(K. C. Chen et al ., 2003) (Guo et al ., 
2007)  (Kiliç, Nielsen, Yüce, & Dönmez, 
2007) . Sahasrabudhe et al .,(2014)  reported 
that to obtain maximum decolorization of 
C.I. Direct Red 81 using Enterococcus 
faecalis strain YZ 66 the pH range of 5 -8 
has to be maintained.  
 
The strain showed a good decolorization 
activity in a range pH 6 -pH 9 and the 
maximum decolorization efficiency of M1A 
was achieved at pH 8 within 24hr of 
incubation for all the three model dyes. 
Decolourization efficiency found to be 
decreased substantial ly in higher acidic and 
alkaline conditions as extreme pH 
environment inhibits bacterial growth.  
 
Similar findings were reported by many 
researchers where the optimum range of pH 
for textile dye decolorization using different 
bacterial species lies betwee n pH 6 to pH 10  
(Chen et al., 2003)  (Guo et al., 2007) (Kiliç,

obtain maximum decolorization of C.I. 
Direct Red 81 using Enterococcus faecalis  
strain YZ 66 the pH range of 5 -8 has to be 
maintained.  
 
The decrease in peak at the respective 
absorption maxima of all the three dyes 
suggests the cleavage of -N=N - bond by the 
anaerobic reductive degradation of the dye 
chromophore. However, we can observe a 
difference in UV -Vis spectral pattern 
between all the th ree dyes. This could be 
due to the difference in structure of dyes 
which follow different degradation pathways and formation of different intermediate 
products.  
 
In conclusion, i t can be concluded from the 
above study that, our isolated strain M1A 
isolate d from textile wastewater is highly 
efficient in decolorization of different textile 
dyes in a wide concentration range. The 
organism was able to achieve 82 -87% 
decolorization of RG -19, 80 -91% 
decolorization of RNB and 78 -92% 
decolorization of RR -198 dye w ithin 24hr of

 characterization techniques M1A was 
identified as Enterococcus durans  GM13 
(GenBank Accession Number: 
KC213474.1). Effect of different physico -
chem ical parameters on dye decolorization 
efficiency of M1A has been studied. The 
organism was found to be mesophilic in 
nature, showing its maximum decolorization 
activity at 35◦C temperature. Neutral to 
slightly alkaline pH was found to be 
favourable for ach ieving maximum 
decolorization potential of M1A strain. 5% 
inoculum volume and static incubation 
condition was found to be effective for 
maximum decolorization of all the three 
tested dyes.
