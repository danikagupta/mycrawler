  iAbstract 
 Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM, E.C. 5.4.99.2), a coenzyme B
12-dependent 
enzyme, catalyses the inter conversion of succinyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-
CoA. The gene ( sbm) encoding this enzyme is found in Escherichia coli (E. coli ) 
at 62.3min on the E. coli  chromosome. However, the metabolic role of this 
enzyme in the organism is not known. This project involves an investigation into 
this metabolic obscurity.  
 
The sbm gene is part of a four gene operon which also includes argK (or ygfD ) 
that codes for a protein kinase catalysing the phosphorylation of two periplasmic binding proteins involved in cationic amino acid transport, ygfG  that codes for 
methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase and ygfH  that codes for propionyl-CoA: 
succinyl-CoA transferase. From existing literature we suspect that this operon, 
including the sbm gene, could be involved in the utilisation of unusual carbon 
sources such as succinate and propionate. An insertion mutant of the sbm gene 
created by transposon mediated mutagenesi s was used for investigating the role 
of this gene. The wild type E. coli  K12 strain, E. coli  TR6524 and the mutant E. 
coli K12 ( sbm::MudJ) were used in this study. 
Growth of the two strains ( E. coli  TR6524 and FA1P1) in minimal media with 
three different concentrations (0.05, 0.5, 5.0µg/mL) of vitamin B 12 and in the 
presence succinate, propionate or gluc ose as the sole source of carbon, was 
studied. Growth was typical in media with glucose with no major differences in 
the growth pattern of the wild type and mutant strain. However, the two strains 
exhibited a differential growth pattern in  media containing succinate, with the 
wild type growing faster than the mutant, indicating the role of the sbm gene in 
the utilisation of this carbon source. Growth in media containing propionate as 
the sole carbon source indicated only marginal differences in the growth pattern 
of the wild type and mutant strain. This result possibly suggests that the other 
pathways for propionate utilisation in E. coli compensate for the lack of a 
functional Sbm protein in the mutant strain.  iiPromoter analysis indicated the presence of a promoter induced by σS, a 
transcription factor involved in the e xpression of proteins under stress or 
stationary phase growth conditions. Reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) studies of the genes of the sbm operon ( sbm-argK-ygfG-
ygfH) under the same growth conditions were  carried out. Densitometric analysis 
of the PCR products suggested that the transcription level of sbm was higher in 
E. coli  grown in succinate as compared to  when grown in glucose and not as 
much when grown in propionate indicating a transcriptional level control of the 
sbm gene expression during the utilisation of succinate. RT-PCR studies also 
indicated a higher level of transcription of the gene in the stationary phase of the 
culture during the utilisation of succina te. Real time reverse transcription PCR 
(QPCR) analysis was used for the absolute quantification of the transcription of 
the genes of the sbm operon. An increase in the mRNA levels corresponding to 
the sbm, arg K and  ygfG genes was observed as E. coli  TR6524 growth reached 
stationary phase, in the presence of succina te or propionate as the sole source of 
carbon as compared to glucose, In contrast, the highest mRNA levels 
corresponding to the  ygfH gene were observed in the early log-phase of growth. 
This indicated a differential transcriptional level control of the genes within the 
operon. This study further established the possible role of this operon in the 
utilisation of succinate and propionate. 
The MCM enzyme activity measurement in the whole cell extracts of the wild 
type   E. coli K12, grown under the above mentioned conditions, led to the first 
ever measurement of MCM activity in wild type E. coli . These measurements 
also revealed a four fold increase of th e MCM specific activity in the case of 
growth in succinate (4.76x10-3U/mg) and a two fold increase for growth in 
propionate (2.79x10-3U/mg) compared to that observed with growth in glucose 
(1.37x10-3U/mg), indicating a significant level of involvement of the enzyme in 
succinate utilisation, and to a lesser extent in propionate utilisation.  
 
The proteomic analysis to understand the gene expression pattern of E. coli  
TR6524 was carried out using cells harvested at the stationary phase. The results showed that growth conditions induced th e expression of transport related (HisJ, 
DppA) and energy generating proteins (PckA, AceF) required by E. coli  to cope  iiiwith the stressful growth conditions. However, Sbm was not identified among 
the limited protein spots that were analysed. 
 
Finally, E. coli  K12 sbm gene was successfully cloned into B. cereus SPV 
leading to the development of a metabolically engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate 
producing strain of B. cereus . The intention was to provide the bacteria with a 
natural intracellular source of propionyl-CoA, leading to the production of the 
P(3HB- co-3HV) copolymer from structurally non related carbon sources like 
glucose. 
 
Hence, this work has initiated investigation into the metabolic role of the sbm 
gene product in E. coli . In addition, it has also led to the use of this gene product 
in metabolic engineering applications.   ivList of abbreviations

 Introduction 
 11.1 Vitamin B 12- a brief look into the past 
The history of vitamin B 12 (Figure 1.1) dates back to 1925 with the descriptions by 
George Whipple, George Minot and Willia m Murphy of the anti-pernicious anaemia 
factor which won them the Nobel Prize in 1934.  This in turn led to the isolation of 
the cofactor by Smith and Folkers in 1948.  This independent discovery changed the therapeutic treatment for pe rnicious anaemia from several grams of uncooked liver a 
day to a few micrograms of a red crysta lline compound (Banerjee and Ragsdale, 
2003).

1.2 Structure of coenzyme B 12  
As major attempts were being made to el ucidate the identity and structure of the 
anti-pernicious anaemia factor, Barker ( 1958) demonstrated that the transformation 
of glutamate to β-methylaspartate required a biologically active cobalamin. This 
observation stimulated an interest in the search for coenzyme B 12-dependent 
enzymes that led to the discovery of a bi ologically active form of cobalamin, methyl 
cobalamin (MeCbl).  Presently, three classes of coenzyme B 12-dependent enzymes 
are recognised, the isomerases, the methyltransferases, and the reductive dehalogenases (Banerjee, 2003 & Banerj ee and Ragsdale, 2003). The crystal 
structure of vitamin B

 31.3 Coenzyme B 12-dependent isomerases 
Twelve coenzyme B 12-dependent enzymes have b een identified (Ludwig and 
Matthews, 1997 & Krautler, 2005). The disc overy and isolation of glutamate 
mutase, the first B 12 enzyme to be recognised, led to  the discovery of the coenzyme 
forms of B 12. The reactive Co-C bond at the core of cobalamin, depending on 
whether it is in an active site of a methyl transferase or an isomerase, cleaves either 
heterolytically or homolytically, respect ively (Banerjee, 1997) . In all of the 
adenosylcobalamin dependent enzymes ex cept ribonucleotide reductase, homolytic 
cleavage and generation of a substrate radical is followed by a rearrangement involving the interchange of the adjacen t ‘H’ and ‘R’ substituents (Figure 1.6). 
These reactions, that include the inte r-conversions of methylmalonyl-CoA and 
succinyl-CoA, glutamate and methylaspartat e, and methyleneglutarate and methyl 
aconitate are chemically difficult rear rangements in which carbon-carbon bonds are 
broken and reformed (Ludwig and Matth ews, 1997; Banerjee and Ragsdale, 2003 & 
Krautler, 2005). The interconversion of isobutyryl-CoA and n-butyryl-CoA, a 
reaction very similar to that catalysed by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, involves the 
coenzyme B
12-dependent isobutyryl CoA mutase (Zerbe-Burkardt et al ., 1998). 
Another group of mutases catalyse rearrangements in  which carbon-oxygen or 
carbon-nitrogen bonds are broken and remade  in the conversions of diols to 
aldehydes and of ethanolamine to ammonia and acetaldehyde. In these reactions, the 
shifts of ‘OH’ or ‘NH 2’ are followed by elimination of water or ammonia. A further 
group of mutases catalyse the migration of  amino groups in lysine, ornithine, or 
leucine. Hence, the diversity of the mi grating group for the reactions catalysed by 
coenzyme B 12-dependent mutases ranges fro m carbon containing groups (in 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, isobutyryl -CoA mutase, glutamate mutase, and 
methyleneglutarate mutase) to nitroge n (in ethanolamine ammonia lyase, D-
ornithine aminomutase, and β- lysine mutase) and oxygen (in diol dehydratase) 
(Ludwig and Matthews, 1997 & Banerjee and Ragsdale, 2003).  Ribonucleotide reduction by adenosylc obalamin dependent ribonucleotide 
triphosphate reductase follows a unique path way where the reaction is initiated by  f

 5The histidine is embedded in a ‘DX HXXG’ sequence, which is the only primary 
sequence motif that appears to be conserved in both the coenzyme B 12-dependent 
isomerase and methyltransferase family members that use the same cofactor binding mode. In this mode, the nucleotide tail is bound in an extende d conformation that 
results in dimethylbenzimidazole be ing >10Å removed from the cobalt  to which it is 
coordinated in the absence of the enzyme. The isomerases in this subfamily include 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, glutamate mutase, methyleneglutarate mutase, 
isobutyryl-CoA mutase, and lysine 5, 6 aminomutase (Ludwig and Matthews, 1997 
& Banerjee and Ragsdale, 2003).  
1.3.2 Coenzyme B 12 -dependent carbon skeleton isomerases 
The carbon skeleton isomerases are the largest subfamily of coenzyme B 12-
dependent enzymes found in bacteria, wh ere they play im portant roles in 
fermentation pathways. The only exception is  methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is 
found in both bacteria and  man. Figure 1.4 sh ows the reactions catalysed by four of 
the coenzyme B 12-dependent carbon skeleton isomeras es. The groups that migrate in 
the forward reaction are shown w ithin the boxes (Banerjee, 2003).

The rearrangements involving hydrogen ab straction from an aliphatic carbon, 
catalysed by the carbon skeleton mutases, are particularly difficult reactions that 
require a powerful catalyst. The reaction catalysed by MCM involves the positional interchange of a COSCoA group and a hydrogen atom on the vicinal carbon. The

Figure 1.6: Reaction mechanism of the reaction catalysed by MCM 
 
Catalysis is initiated by substrate induced homolysis of the Co-C bond leading to the 
formation of a 5’-deoxyadenosyl radical and a reduced cofactor w ith its metal atom 
in the cobalt (II) oxidation state (referred to as cob(II)alamin). The 5’-deoxyadenosyl 
radical subsequently abstracts a hydroge n atom from the bound substrate, thus 
generating a protein bound 5’-deoxyadenosine and a ‘substrate-derived’ radical. The 
rearrangement of the latter results in the formation of a ‘product-relate d’ radical. 
Retrieval of hydrogen from the methyl group of 5’-deoxyadenosine yields the 
product and regenerates the 5’-deoxyadenosyl  radical, which can then recombine 
with the reduced cofactor (Roth et al ., 1996; Ludwig and Matthews, 1997 & CoHCOSCoA

 10Crystal structures of P. shermanii MCM revealed that both α and β subunits consist 
of two principal domai ns: an eight-stranded α/β triose phosphate isomerase barrel 
(α/β)8 and a flavodoxin-like AdoCbl-binding fold. The cofactor is sandwiched 
between the ( α/β)8 barrel and the flavodoxin-like AdoCbl-binding fold. The human, 
mouse, and Escherichia coli  (E. coli ) enzymes, however, are homodimers. 
(Korotkova and Lidstrom, 2004) and the st ructure of the homodimer, unlike the 
heterodimer, is not clear. 
 
1.4.1 The biological function of MCM 
1.4.1.1 Bacteria 
In prokaryotes such as P. shermanii,  MCM is involved in the synthesis of propionate 
from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in termediates and serves to maintain the 
redox balance of the organism  (Banerjee, 1997). The r eaction catalysed  by MCM in 
S. cinnamonensis , is a source of building blocks in  polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis 
by directing the flux of carbon towards the raw materials for antibiotic assembly 
(Zerbe-Burkardt et al ., 1998) in addition to its role in the conversion of succinyl-
CoA into propionate (Roy, 1996 & Gruber and Kratky, 2001). In the case of polyhydroxyalkanoate-producing Nocardia corallina (N. corallina ), Valentin and 
Dennis (1996) identified that  the supply of the precursor  for co-polymer, poly(3-
hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), P(3HB-co-3HV) production mainly 
depended on the availability of propionyl -CoA. The latter was obtained from the 
TCA cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA via MCM. A N. corallina  mutant for the 
MCM gene was unable to grow on odd chai n fatty acids but exhibited wild type 
growth on glucose, succinate and even-c hain fatty acids. This suggested that 
propionate is utilised after its conve rsion to succinyl-CoA principally via MCM for 
its further oxidation or utilisation in bi osynthetic pathways, in addition to the 
accumulation of polymers with high cont ent of 3-hydroxyvalerate (Valentin and 
Dennis, 1996). These results have been the basis of metabolic engineering studies 
that have reported an increased P( 3HB-co-3HV) production by recombinant 
Salmonella typhimurium  (S. typhimurium ) from non related car bon sources such as 
glycerol (Aldor et al ., 2002). The conversion of succinyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-Introduction 
 11CoA has been reported to be an important  stage in rifamycin SV biosynthesis of 
Amycolatopsis mediterranei  (Zhang et al. , 1999). In Saccharopolyspora erythraea 
(formerly  Streptomyces erythraeus ), it was observed th at succinyl-CoA was 
isomerised to methylmalonyl-CoA before its incorporation in to the macrocyclic 
lactone of erythromycin. The presence of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which 
catalyses this isomerisation, was demonstrat ed in cell-free extr acts prepared from 
this organism. It was also found that MC M activity increased over 12-fold at the 
time of the most rapid antibiotic producti on, and the activity level dropped when the 
antibiotic production ceased (Hunaiti et al., 1984). In certain b acterial fermentations, 
succinate is converted to propionate via the mutase, rather than being removed from 
the system (Roth et al. , 1996).  
 
1.4.1.2 Parasites 
In Ascaris lumbricoides (A. lumbricoides ), one molecule of adenosylcobalamin 
binds tightly to each of the two identical  subunits of the enzyme. The nematode 
accumulates propionate and volatile fatty acids derived from propionate in the 
mitochondria. The conversion of succinate to propionate via propionyl-CoA 
carboxylase, MCM and acyl CoA transferas e enzyme systems is coupled to a 
substrate level phosphorylation in the nematode (Han et al. , 1984). MCM from the 
helminths Fasciola hepatica  and Spirometra mansonoides  has also been shown to 
have a function similar to that in A. lumbricoides  (Pietrzak and Saz, 1981). 
 
1.4.1.3 Mammals  
The highest concentration of MCM is f ound in ruminant kidney and tissues as 
propionate constitutes the major part of the ruminant diet. In mammals, 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is required for the metabolism of propionate, which 
may be derived from odd chain fatty ac ids, branched chain amino acids and 
cholesterol, to succ inyl-CoA (Banerjee et al ., 2001 & Gruber and Kratky, 2001). 
The conversion of odd chain fatty acids and branched amino acids to succinyl-CoA 
by MCM occurs in the mammalian liver and the succinyl-CoA formed can then 
enter the TCA cycle (Ledley et al. , 1990).  Propionate is fi rst activated to propionyl-Introduction 
 12CoA, then carboxylated to methylmalonyl-C oA and finally isomerised to succinyl-
CoA by MCM found in the mitochondrial matrix, as shown in Figure 1.8.  
 
 
Figure 1.8: Reaction catalysed by MCM in mammals. General route of conversion of propionyl-
CoA to succinyl-CoA (a: propio nyl CoA carboxylase, b:methyl malonyl-CoA epimerase and c: 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase)  
 
1.4.2 Clinical importance of MCM 
Impaired functioning of methylmalonyl-C oA mutase either caused by genetic 
defects or induced by cobalamin deficien cy leads to methylmalonic acidemia in 
which precursors and abnormal metabol ites of methylmalonyl-CoA accumulate. 
Depending on the severity of the condition, the clinical consequences range from 
benign which can be cured by dietary supplementation with vitamin B 12 (Ledley et 
al., 1984) to neonatal death (Matsui et al ., 1983). Renal insufficiency, chronic 
tubulointerstitial nephropathy and end stage renal failure, are symptoms reported in 
patients suffering from methylmalonic acidur ia due to MCM deficiency (Van Calcar 
et al., 1998). Patients with inborn errors in  methylmalonyl-CoA mutase metabolism 
are classified as being either mut- (enzyme activity is detectable), or mut0 (enzyme 
activity is not detectable). Over 20 mutati ons related to in-born errors have been 
reported in the human MCM gene and many of these are clustered in the carboxy-
terminal B 12 binding domain (Banerjee, 1997). 
 
1.5 Coenzyme B 12 biosynthesis 
In constructing adenosylcobalamin, mu ltiple components are synthesized 
individually and then assembled. The nucle otide loop is assembled by first activating 
the aminopropanol side chain of cobinamide  to form GDP-cobinamide. The Co-axial 
ligand, dimethylbenzimidazole (Dmb), is sy nthesized separately and converted to a H3C H3CH3C

and is derived from uroporphyrinogen III, a precursor in the synthesis of heme, 
siroheme, cobamides and chlorophylls (in photosynthetic organisms) (Lawrence and 
Roth, 1996 & Rodionov et al., 2003). In S. typhimurium , about thirty enzymes, in 
very low concentrations and with the form ation of highly labile intermediates, are 
involved in the complete synthesis of AdoCbl. The genes coding for the enzymes 
responsible for cobalamin synthesis in S. typhimurium  are clustered together and 
constitute a 20 gene operon located at  44 min on the genetic map (Jeter et al., 1984 
& Lawrence and Roth, 1995). As seen in Figure 1.2, coenzyme B 12 consists of three 
main structural units. The first unit is a central tetrapyrrole-derived corrin ring cobinamide structure. The genes ( cbiABCDETFGHIJKLMNOQP ) that encode 
enzymes responsible for the reactions leadi ng to the formation of cobinamide from 
uroporphyrinogen III belong to the pathway referred to as  CobI. A mutant for Cob I 
(with one of the first 17 ge nes affected) synthesises B
12 if supplied with cobinamide. 
The second unit in coenzyme B 12 is the dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) nucleotide 
loop between the aminopropanol side chain and the central cobalt ion. The gene 
encoding the enzyme for the synthesis of this DMB nucleotide is a part of the 
pathway referred to as CobII. The attachme nt of the corrin ring to the DMB and the 
addition of upper coordinating ligand for th e cobalt (adenosyl or methyl group) are 
catalysed by the enzymes encoded by the cobUS genes  that belong to the CobIII 
pathway. A mutant for Cob II has been shown to synthesise B 12 if Dmb is provided. 
Mutations in Cob III (affecting cobU and cobS ) have shown to interfere with the 
ability to join cobinamide and Dmb and make B 12 even when both intermediates are 
provided.  The CobT protein has multiple activities and acts in both Cob II and III of 
the cobalamin synthesis.The cob genes of the cobinamide operon of S. typhimurium Introduction 
 14represented by their respective pathways are organised in the orde r cobI, cobIII and 
cobII as shown in Figure 1.9 (Lawrence  and Roth, 1995; Raux et al. , 1996 & Roth et 
al., 1996).

1.5.2 Escherichia coli  
Although most enteric bacteria  can synthesise cobalamin de novo  under either 
aerobic or anaerobic conditions, E. coli synthesises cobalamin only when provided 
with the complex intermediate, c obinamide (Lawrence and Roth, 1995). E. coli  
possesses a high affinity active tr ansport system for vitamin B 12. It has the genes of 
the CobII and CobIII pathways but not th e genes of the CobI pathway that are 
essential for cobinamide synthesis (Bassford and Kadner, 1977 & Raux et al. , 1996). 
Thus, E. coli  cannot synthesise its own cobalami n, but can transport (Figures 1.10 
and 1.11) and utilise B 12 from the environment, if necessary. Genetic analysis of B 12 
uptake by E. coli  has shown that three gene products are involved in the biphasic 
process. An outer membrane protein ( btuB  gene product) in E. coli  binds specifically 
to B 12 in an energy-independent process and the second process involves a slower 
energy-dependent accumulation of B 12 in the cell catalysed by the tonB gene product 
(Kadner, 1990 & Roth et al ., 1996). BtuB brings vitamin B 12 across the outer 
membrane into the periplasmic space where it is bound by BtuF. Bassford and Kadner (1977) had identi fied a less efficient btuCD  coded B
12 uptake system in the 
cytoplasmic membrane in E. coli  that acts on the substrate (vitamin B 12) in the 
periplasm (Bassford and Kadner, 1977). The bound B 12 is delivered to the ABC 
transporter BtuCD which uses ATP to transp ort the vitamin into the cytoplasm (Oloo 
et al., 2006).  cbiABCDETFGHIJKLMNOQP  cobUS    cobT

The btuB, tonB and btuC genes are located at 88, 28 and 37.7 min, respectively on 
the E. coli  chromosomal map (Bassford and Kadner, 1977 & Postle and Good, 
1983). The B 12, once transported into the cell, gets  converted to the coenzyme form 
by the gene products of the CobIII ( cobUS ) and CobII ( cobT ) pathways (Raux et al., 
1996).

BtuCD consists of four subunits, arrang ed as two homodimers. BtuC spans the 
membrane with 10 alpha helices per subunit and contains the translocation pathway. 
BtuD is bound to BtuC on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, each subunit 
containing one ATP binding site. The whole transportation process is powered by 
ATP-hydrolysis which takes place in these nucleotide binding domains. BtuF is a 
specialised periplasmic binding protein with  high affinity for binding and delivering 
vitamin B 12 to BtuC. Once BtuF (with B 12 bound) has successfully docked to BtuC, 
the transfer mechanism is initiated (Roth et al., 1996 & Oloo et al., 2006).  
Introduction 
 171.5.3 Comparative analysis of the E. coli  and S. typhimurium cob  operons 
According to Lawrence and Roth (1995) three of the five inferred open reading 
frames that were found in E. coli  were homologous to the cobUST genes in the 
Salmonella typhimurium cob operon which provide the  functions of the genes of the 
cobII  and cobIII pathways. The E. coli genes were termed cobU , cobS , and cobT to 
indicate their similarity to the Salmonella homologues. Database searches revealed 
that the E. coli cobUST genes, like the S. typhimurium cobUST genes, are also 
similar to the homologous c obalamin synthetic genes ( cobPVU ) from Pseudomonas 
denitrificans  (Lawrence and Roth, 1995). 
           
Figure 1.12: Organisation of the E. coli  and S. typhimurium  cob operons. The cobUST  genes 
shown in blue are present in E. coli and the cbiP and cobUST  genes in pink are present in         
S. typhimurium . The overlapping blue and pink boxes i ndicate the part of the operons that 
shows sequence similarity in both bacteria. E. coli lacks the cbiP gene (CobI) responsible for 
cobinamide synthesis but expresses genes coding  CobII and CobIII enzymes that are involved 
in the conversion of an external source of B 12 into coenzyme B 12 required for enzyme catalysis. 
CobIII and CobII pathways share cobT while cobUS is only a part of the cobIII pathway. 
 
The physical map of the cob operon, located at 43.5 min on the E. coli  genetic map, 
has shown that the cobU , cobS , and cobT genes all lie close to each other such that 
the 5’ end of the cobS gene overlaps the 3’ end of the cobU gene. The proximity of 
the genes suggested that they  may form an operon expressed by a promoter upstream CobI S. typhimurium  cobU   cobS cobT

 18of the cobU gene (Lawrence and Roth, 1995). A schematic representation of this 
observation is shown above in Figure 1.12. The three cob genes of  E. coli showed 
between 69% and 72% nucleot ide identity with the S. typhimurium cobU , cobS , and 
cobT genes and the proteins were between  76 and 82% identical (Lawrence and 
Roth, 1995), indicating that the E. coli cob  genes were also involved in cobalamin 
biosynthesis.  Despite this high degree of ho mology observed between the cob genes, typical pairs 
of homologous genes in E. coli and S. typhimurium have been to found to show 
much higher nucleotide identities (84 to 95% ) and encode proteins with more than 
91% amino acid identity (Sharp, 1991). This indi cated that the E. coli cobUST genes 
and S. typhimurium cobUST genes are significantly more different from each other 
than typical gene pairs. The large differences between the S. typhimurium cob genes 
and the E. coli cob genes reflect very weak selec tion for cobalamin synthesis as 
genes under strong selection for func tion show fewer differences between E. coli 
and S. typhimurium  (Sharp, 1991). This indicates that E. coli  does not synthesise or 
need cobalamin for its grow th under natural conditions.  
 
1.5.4 Other bacteria 
Dependence on coenzyme B 12 for enzyme function has been reported in many 
bacteria including P. shermanii, S. cinnamonensis,  Porphyromonas gingivalis and 
Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Raux et al., 1996)  . Bacteria such as Bradyrhizobium 
japonicum require coenzyme B 12 and can synthesise it and Lactobacillus leishmannii  
requires B 12, but cannot synthesise it. Genes clustered together in an operon 
(cobPVU ) organisation in Pseudomaonas denitrificans  responsible for B 12 synthesis 
have been shown to have a se quence similar to that of the cobUST  operon in E. coli  
and S. typhimurium . Klebsiella pneumoniae  can synthesise coenzyme B 12, but only 
under anaerobic conditions (Jeter et al. , 1984, Lawrence and Roth, 1996) due to the 
formation of oxygen sensitive intermediates during the synthesis (Raux et al., 1996).  
 
 Introduction 
 191.6 E. coli , MCM  and the sbm gene 
Roy and Leadlay (1992) identified the gene, sbm, encoding MCM to be located at 
62.8min on the E. coli  chromosome. Analysis of this gene showed a high degree of 
sequence similarity to the human MCM and to the larger subunit of the P. shermanii,  
S. cinnamonensis  and S. erythraea  methylmalonyl-CoA mutases. A detailed 
comparative study showed that the substrat e binding site, the ac tive site and the 
cobalamin binding region, indicated in th e crystal structure of the MCM from P. 
shermanii  were all conserved in the  Sbm protein from  E. coli . This led to the 
hypothesis that the sbm gene codes for MCM in E. coli  (Roy and Leadlay, 1992). 
Further research has determined that the sbm gene actually encodes MCM in E. coli,  
since, the protein product when expressed as a His tagged protein was found to be an 
active methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Haller et al., 2000). The sbm gene forms a part 
of a four-gene operon (Figure 1.13).

Figure 1.13:  The four-gene operon containing the sbm gene (Haller et al. , 2000),  sbm  codes for 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, ygfD (or argK) codes for a protein kinase that catalyses the 
phosphorylation of two periplasmic binding proteins involved in cationic amino acid transport, 
ygfG  codes for methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase and ygfH codes for propionyl-CoA: succinyl-
CoA transferase . 
Haller and coworkers (2000) suggested that  the proteins encoded by the four-gene 
operon could be involved in the decarboxyla tion of succinate to propionate as shown 
in Figure 1.14. However, this post ulated pathway does not involve the ygfD gene 
product.

 20      
Figure 1.14: Succinate to propionate. The postulated pathway involving the conversion of 
succinate to propionate using the sbm gene in E. coli (Haller et al., 2000)  
The previously known methylmalonyl-CoA  mutase pathway involves a biotin 
dependent propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase and 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase  reactions (Figure 1.8). E. coli  possess MCM, but it is 
not known to have methylmalonylCoA epimerase or the biotin dependent 
propionylCoA carboxylase necessary for the co mpletion of the latter cycle (Haller et 
al., 2000). However, the operon does c onsist of a methylmalonyl-CoA 
decarboxylase encoded by ygfG  that yields the 2R-methylmalonyl-CoA, 
circumventing the necessity of the methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase and the 
propionylCoA carboxylase found in other organisms (Figure 1.14). This isomer is a 
substrate for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and hence this pathway shown in Figure 
1.8 could be used in the reverse direction for the utilisation of propionate. 
 
1.7 Propionate and succinate metabolism in E. coli  
1.7.1 MCM and propionate utilisation 
Ashworth and Kornberg (1964) suggested a role for MCM in the utilisation of 
propionate by E. coli . In the experimental study, they observed that isocitrate lyase-
less mutants of E. coli  could utilise propionate but were unable to grow on acetate 
(Ashworth and Kornberg, 1964). The differen ce in the growth of the bacteria was OO

 21postulated to be due to the convers ion of propionate to succinate via the reaction 
catalysed by MCM (Figure 1.8). Extensive studies on the growth of  E. coli  E26 
using propionate as sole carbon s ource carried out by Kolodziej et al., 1968 showed 
that E. coli  E26 grew with an extended lag phase of about 90 hours when it was 
grown in minimal salts media with propiona te as the sole source of carbon. This, 
they suggested, was a sign of adaptation to the fatty acid and not a mutational 
process because, when the propionate adapte d cultures were sub- cultured in complex 
media and re-introduced into propionate medi a, the cells appeared to have lost their 
capacity to initiate a rapid growth in the substrate. Inclusion of a source of B 12 in the 
propionate growth media for E. coli  reduced the lag phase from 90 hours to 55 
hours. This observation sugge sted that adapta tion to propionate is limited by a B 12-
dependent pathway, possibly involving MCM (Wegener et al. , 1968). Further, the 
lag phase was reduced to 65 hours (from 90 hours) when the E. coli  was allowed to 
grow in the propionate media with lim iting concentrations (0.5µmoles/ml) of 
succinate and found that succinate induced the enzyme formation necessary for the 
utilisation of propionate indicating the use of comm on enzyme systems for the 
metabolism of both carbon sources (Kolodziej et al., 1968).  
 
Evans et al . (1993) proposed that in E. coli , propionate is activated to propionyl-
CoA which can then follow one of two path ways that leads to the formation of 
acetyl-CoA (propionate oxidation, Figur e 1.15a) or succinyl-CoA (propionate 
carboxylation, Figure 1.15b) which then enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In 
order to understand the relative cont ribution of the two pathways, Evans et al . 
(1993) analysed the mechanism by wh ich glutamate was formed from  
[3-13C] propionate in E. coli. Using 13C NMR analysis they measured the  
13C label distribution in glut amate through the two pathways. It was thought that [3-
13C] propionate would be oxidised to [3-13C] pyruvate which would then be 
transformed to [2-13C] acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase before entering the 
TCA cycle (Figure 1.15a). The 13C label in the glutamate produced would 
predominantly be on C-4. Duri ng the carboxylati on reaction [3-13C] propionyl-CoA 
would be carboxylated to [2-13C] succinyl-CoA by propi onyl-CoA:succinyl-CoA Introduction 
 22transferase which would then enter the TCA cycle as shown in Figure 1.15b. 13C that 
entering the TCA cycle via the latter path would lead to the production of glutamate 
labelled at C-2 or C-3.

The results of the NMR anal ysis of the growth of E. coli  in minimal media with 
propionate as the sole source of carbon show ed that there was a significant increase 
in the labelling of glutamate at the C-2 and C-3 positions when the cells were grown 
in minimal media with B 12. This supported the finding that exponential growth on 
propionate was stimulated by inclusion of B 12 in the media confirming earlier 
observations by Kolodziej et al. (1968) and Wegener and coworkers (1968). These CH 3CSCoAO

 24results showed that some of the [2-13C] propionate entered the TCA cycle via the 
carboxylation pathway,  i.e., through succinyl-CoA deri ved from propionate. Thus, 
from the NMR analysis, Evans et al. (1993) concluded that the B 12 dependent MCM 
reaction pathway was one of  the pathways used by E. coli  when grown on 
propionate as a sole sour ce of carbon (Kolodziej et al., 1968; Wegener et al., 1968 & 
Evans et al. , 1993). 
 Propionate utilisation by microorganisms has been under continuous scrutiny. This 
could be attributed to the fact that un like other fatty acids that undergo just 
oxidation, propionate is thought to be meta bolised using multiple pathways which 
include α-oxidation, β-oxidation, α-carboxylation, reductiv e carboxylation or 
Claisen condensation. Textor et al. (1997) identified the pr esence of the metylcitrate 
pathway (Figure 1.16), which they descri bed as the pathway of choice for the 
oxidation of propionate in E. coli (Textor et al., 1997).  
 This led to the identification of the methylcitrate synthase encoded by the prpC gene 
located at 8min in the E. coli  genome. This gene shared a 96% sequence homology 
with the identified prpC gene involved in propionate utilisation in Salmonella 
typhimurium . The gene coding for methylcitrate synthase in E. coli belongs to a 
cluster of four genes, the products of which have high si milarities to those of the 
propionate catabolism operon ( prpBCDE ) in S. typhimurium (Textor et al., 1997).

In the case of the [2-13C] propionate precursor (Evans et al ., 1993), flux via the 
methylcitrate pathway could lead to [2-13C] pyruvate and to [2-13C] oxaloacetate,

AlanineIntroduction 
 26London and co-workers (1999) used [1, 2-13C] propionate to determine retention of 
the 13C-13C-12C carbon skeleton in pyruvate and alanine (Figure 1.16) involving 
propionate adapted E. coli . The pattern of labeling of alanine was mostly retained, 
even if the [1, 2-13C] propionate precursor was substa ntially diluted with unlabelled 
propionate. The retentio n of the carbon skeleton of th e propionate was consistent 
with flux via the methylcitrate pathway but not with flux through the methylmalonyl 
pathway (London et al ., 1999). Although this analysis produced convincing 
argument for propionate utilisation via the methylcitrate pathway, it is important to 
emphasise that E. coli  MG1655 used in the study wa s grown in defined media 
without any source of vitamin B 12 added to it, unlike that of Evans et al. (1993). The 
absence of vitamin B 12 would not allow the forma tion of MCM holoenzyme and 
hence the carboxylation pathway involving sbm (MCM) would not be active in the 
breakdown of propionate.  
1.7.2 MCM and succinate utilisation 
The earliest evidence for growth on succinate was provided by Kolodziej et al . 
(1968) when the lag phase of E. coli  E26 was reduced to 65 hours when the bacteria 
was allowed to grow in the propionate media with limiting concentrations (0.5µmoles/ml) of succinate and suggested that succinate and propionate metabolism involved the use of common enzyme systems (Kolodziej et al ., 1968). Limited 
studies have been carried out on succinate metabolism in E. coli  (Liu et al., 2005 & 
Paliy and Gunasekara, 2007). Liu and cowo rkers (2005) noticed an upregulation of 
59 genes and down regulation of only 3 genes when E. coli  was grown in succinate 
and have noted that as the substrate was used and products were formed, there was 
an increase in the transcription of new stress related genes,  genes required for 
motility and σS encoding rpoS gene (Liu et al., 2005). None of the genes of the sbm 
operon were reported by Liu et al. (2005) and this could be due to the absence of any 
vitamin B
12 in the growth conditions used. Paliy and Gunasekara (2007) reported an 
increased lag phase of 20 hours when E. coli  BL21 was grown in minimal media 
with succinate compared to  that of the wild type E. coli which did not show any such 
delay in growth. The lag phase observed with BL21 was attributed to a lower Introduction 
 27expression of fumA gene, encoding fumarase, through which the utilisation of both 
fumarate and succinate proceed, via the TCA cycle, and an insufficient initial 
metabolic flux through fumarase might not sustain growth. An insufficient transport 
capacity for succinate in E. coli  BL21 was thought to be due  to possible mutations in 
the genes of the atp operon that encodes the H+-ATP complex required for the 
transport of C4-dicarboxylates such as succinate, resulting in a lag of 20 hours (Paliy 
and Gunasekara, 2007). Although th ese studies describe certain aspects of growth of 
E. coli  on succinate, there has been no evidence  of the involvement of MCM or the 
other genes of the sbm operon. As described previously in Section 1.6, Haller et al. 
(2000), identified the four gene oper on (Figure 1.13) and confirmed that sbm coded 
for MCM in E. coli . The authors also described the po ssibility of the involvement of 
three of the four genes of the operon in  the decarboxylati on of succinate to 
propionate. The current study has been the on ly report so far that has attempted to 
describe the relation between su ccinate utilisation and MCM. 
 Succinate is also an important intermediate in the TCA cycle and is hence involved in large number of complex metabolic networks. Utilisation of propionate by E. coli  
has been well established and many authors (as reviewed above, Section 1.7.1) have 
researched on the different pathways by which propionate is being used by E. coli  
and other bacteria. Relatively less research has been carrie d out on the growth of    
E. coli  on succinate as the sole carbon sour ce as reviewed in Section 1.7.2. This 
study attempted to investigate the role of MCM in both propi onate and succinate 
metabolism on the basis of th e hypothesis proposed by Haller et al., 2000. 
 
1.8 Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) 
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs; Figure 1.17), are polyesters of 3-, 4-, 5-and 6-
hydroxyalkanoic acids, produced by a variet y of bacterial species under nutrient-
limiting conditions with excess carbon. PHAs exhib it a high degree of 
polymerisation and possess very high molecu lar masses. They are biodegradable, 
insoluble in water, non-toxi c, biocompatible, piezoelectri c, thermoplastic and/or Introduction 
 28elastomeric (Anderson and Dawes, 1990; Choi and Lee, 2000; Hazer and 
Steinbuckel, 2007 & Valappil et al., 2007a). 
 
 
 
Figure 1.17: General chemical structure of PHAs. R 1 and R 2 = H, alkyl groups C 1-C13, x= 1-4 
and n=100-300,000  
 
Polyhydroxyalkanoates from prokaryotes represent the most important group of 
natural polyoxoesters beside polymalic acid from eukaryotes and cutin and suberin 
from plants. About 150 different constituents  have been observed in PHAs isolated 
from different bacter ial species (Valappil et al., 2007a). PHAs have been classified 
into two types according to the length of the side chain. The short-chain-length ( scl) 
polyhydroxyalkanoic acids have an alkyl side  chain with up to two carbon atoms 
(e.g. PHAs produced by Cupriavidus necator, C. necator ) and the medium chain 
length hydroxyalkanoic acids, mclPHA, have an alkyl side  chain consisting of at 
least three carbon atoms ( e.g. PHAs accumulated by Pseudomonas oleovorans ). 
Members of sclPHAs include poly(3-hydr oxybutyrate), P(3HB); poly(3-
hydroxyvalerate), P(3HV) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyvalerate), 
P(3HB- co-3HV) copolymer. On the other ha nd, poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), P(3HO) 
and poly(3-hydroxynonanoate), P(3HN), are mostly formed as copolymers of         3-hydroxyoctanoate or 3-hydroxynonanoate together with 3-hydroxyhexanoate, 
3HHx; 3-hydroxyheptanoate 3HHp and/or  3-hydroxydecanoate, 3HD are typical 
examples of mclPHAs. Some sclPHAs may be too rigid and brittle and may lack the 
superior mechanical properties require d for biomedical and packaging film 
applications while mclPHAs may be elastomeric but have very low mechanical 
strength (Hazer and St einbuckel, 2007 & Valappil et al., 2007a).

 291.8.1 PHA producing bacteria  
PHAs are produced on an industrial scale using Gram negative bacteria such as 
Cupriavidus necator, Methylobacterium organophillum, P. oleovorans  and 
recombinant E. coli . PHA producing Gram positive species include 
Corynebacterium matruchotii , Rhodococcus ruber , Nocardia corollina , Bacillus  
cereus and Bacillus megaterium . The Gram-positive genera Corynebacterium , 
Nocardia  and Rhodococcus  are the only wild-type ba cteria, which naturally 
synthesise the commercially important co-polymer P(3HB-co-3HV) from simple 
carbon sources such as glucose (Valappil et al., 2007a). 
 
1.8.2 Polyhydroxybutyrate, P(3HB) 
P(3HB) is one of the most abundant PHA th at has been studied in detail. P(3HB) 
occurs as insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions  found exclusively in many eubacteria and 
also in some extremely halophilic ar chaea as storage compound for carbon and 
energy. It contributes to up to about 90% (w /w) of the cellular dry mass. It can be 
produced from renewable resources and are hence considered an alternative to non-
biodegradable plastics produ ced from fossil oils (Ste inbuchel and Lutke-Eversloh, 
2003).  
 
1.8.2.1 Importance of P(3HB) in bacteria 
The possession of P(3HB) in some bact eria slows the degradation of cellular 
components such as RNA and protein dur ing nutrient starvation (Steinbuchel and 
Lutke-Eversloh, 2003). P(3HB) enhances the su rvival of some bacteria by serving as 
a carbon and energy source for spore formation in some Bacillus  species and for the 
encystment of azotobacters (Anderson and Dawes, 1990). It has been hypothesised 
that P(3HB) in azotobacters and Rhizobium  sp. strain ORS 571 provides an 
oxidisable substrate that offers respiratory protection to nitrogenase under 
environmental conditions when appropr iate exogenous substrate(s) is not 
immediately available for oxida tion (Anderson and Dawes, 1990).  
 
 
 Introduction 
 301.8.2.2 Metabolic engineering for P(3HB) production 
P(3HB) is a crystalline ho mopolymer that can be produc ed from a single carbon 
substrate such as glucose (Choi and Lee, 2000). Metabolic ally engineered microbes 
and insects have been used  for P(3HB) production.  
 PHA synthase gene from C. necator  was introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae  
cells and it was observed that P(3HB) gra nules accumulated to only 0.5% of the cell 
dry weight. This low level of P(3HB) wa s thought to be due to the insufficient 
activity of the endogenous β-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase 
(Figure 1.18) enzymes (Madison and Huisman, 1999).   In another study, expression of the C. necator phbC gene in insect cells was 
achieved in cabbage looper,  Trichoplusia ni , cells by using a ba culovirus system. 
Expression of PHA synthase gene was succes sful and 50% of the total protein was 
P(3HB) synthase, as observed within 60 hours of viral in fection (Madison and 
Huisman, 1999). In addition, a study with in sect cells attempted to create a diverse 
set of PHA monomers endogenously by transf ecting a mutant form of the rat fatty 
acid synthase into fall armyworm,  Spodoptera frugiperda , cells by using a 
baculovirus. This previously characterise d fatty acid synthase mutant did not extend 
fatty acids beyond 3-hydroxybutyrate, which wa s subsequently converted to P(3HB) 
by the co-transfected P(3HB) synthase from C. necator . The presence of P(3HB) 
granules in the insect cells was vi sualised by immunofluorescence (Williams et al., 
1996).  
1.8.3 Polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate, P(3HB-co-3HV)  
P(3HB-co-3HV) is a copolymer of monomers  of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and       
3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) and can exist with various mole percentages of                 
3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV). Incorporating HV in  the structure of P(3HB) changes the 
mechanical properties of the polymer givi ng the co-polymer more flexibility and 
processability. It has been shown that by varying the hydroxyva lerate content of 
P(3HB- co-3HV), the flexibility, impact strength, and degree of degradation of the Introduction 
 31final copolymer can be altered. Hence, P(3HB-co-3HV) is more appropriate for 
commercial applications as compared to P(3HB). Thus P(3HB- co-3HV) is an ideal 
candidate for in-vivo  use such as drug delivery or tissue engineering scaffolds for 
bone regeneration. (Choi and Lee, 2000; Aldor and Keasling, 2003 & Misra et al., 
2006).  
1.8.3.1 Bacteria producing P(3HB-co-3HV) 
P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymer is produced by Alcaligenes latus , Pseudomonas 
pseudoflava , Micrococcus halodenitrificans , B. cereus , P. cepacia , and C. necator . 
The microorganisms need to be supplied with glucose (or sucrose in case of A. latus ) 
and propionic acid or other propionoge nic carbon sources unde r nitrogen-limited 
conditions. The mixture of the substrates  produce either P(3HB) homopolymer or 
P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymer depending on thei r relative concentrations (Hazer and 
Steinbuckel, 2007).  
 
1.8.3.2 Metabolic pathways leading to  the production of P(3HB-co-3HV) 
Industrial production of P(3HB-co-3HV) involves the addition of glucose and 
propionate to a fed-batch fermentation processes. Adjusting the ratio of these carbon sources in the feed is used to control the copolymer composition. Propionate which 
is activated to form the propionyl-CoA precu rsor of HV production is not only toxic, 
but also very expensive to produce industrially. Hence, a more economical alternative is to produce propionyl-CoA via internal metabolism, from a relatively 
inexpensive carbon source such as glucose.  P(3HBV-co-3HV) is synthesised from 
its precursors, acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, by three enzymes as shown in Figure 
1.18.        Introduction

Figure 1.18: Metabolic pathway involved in the production of P(3HB-co-3HV).   
 
The first step involves either a condensati on of two molecules of acetyl-CoA or a 
condensation of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-C oA by a 3-ketothiolase encoded by 
phaA . The resulting intermediate, either aceto acetyl-CoA or 3-ketovaleryl-CoA, is 
reduced by the phaB gene product, an NADPH-de pendent acetoacetyl-CoA 
reductase. This reaction generates 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxyvaleryl-
CoA, which are incorporated into the gr owing polymer chain by PHA synthase or 
polymerase, encoded by phaC , as four- and five-carbon monomers, respectively.  
 Valentin and Dennis (1996) identified that  the supply of the precursor for co-
polymer P(3HB- co-3HV) production in N. corallina,  mainly depended on the 
availability of propionyl-CoA which was obt ained from the TCA cycle intermediate 
succinyl-CoA via MCM. This was confirmed by the inability of the MCM mutant of 
N. corallina,  to grow on odd chain fatty acids,  leading to the conclusion that P(3HB-co-3HV)

 33propionate is utilised, af ter its conversion to succinyl-CoA principally via MCM 
(Valentin and Dennis, 1996). Nuclear ma gnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) 
studies suggested that the 3HV monomer is  derived from acetyl-CoA and propionyl-
CoA, where the latter is a product of th e methylmalonyl-CoA pathway (Madison and 
Huisman, 1999). Hence, R. ruber and N. corallina accumulate PHAs containing 
3HV even in the absence of typical HV precu rsors such as propiona te or valerate in 
the medium.   
1.8.3.3 Evidence for metabolic engineering for P(3HB- co-3HV) production  
The price of the P(3HB-co-3HV) will ultimately depend on parameters such as 
substrate cost, polymer yield on the s ubstrate, and the efficiency of product 
formulation in the downstream processing. Successful commercial production requires that all conditions for production be optimised. P(3HB- co-3HV) producers 
such as R. ruber  and N. corallina  have evolved with the ab ility to accumulate the co-
polymer, naturally. However, th ey tend have a long gene ration time and relatively 
low optimal growth temperature, are often hard to lyse and contain pathways for 
polymer degradation. Bacteria such as E. coli  can neither synthesise nor degrade the 
polymer, but, it grows fast providing a s horter cycle time for the production process 
and at a higher growth temp erature saving the cost associated with the heating and 
cooling of the bioreactor. It is also eas y to lyse, leading to a cost effective 
purification of the polymer granul es. Construction of better P(3HB- co-3HV) 
producers by applying the insights of gene tic and metabolic engineering promises 
the production of higher amounts of the polymer and in organisms suh as E. coli  that 
are easy to manipulate.  An interesting pathway for poly(3HB- co-3HV) biosynthesis was recently engineered 
in recombinant S. enterica serovar typhimurium by Aldor and co-workers (2002). 
The genes for (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase ( sbm) and (2R)-methylmalonyl-
CoA decarboxylase ( ygfG ) from E. coli were cloned and expressed  in this 
Salmonella strain, thus enabling the conversi on of succinyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA. 
In addition, they inserted into the gene for 2-methylcitric acid synthase ( prpC ) of Introduction 
 34this bacterium the PHA biosynthesis operon of Actinobacter (phaCAB ) thereby 
establishing PHA biosynthesis and disrupting propionate utilisation via the 
methylcitrate pathway (Figure 1.16). This recombinant Salmonella sp. synthesised 
P(3HB- co-3HV) with up to 31 mol% 3HV via succinyl-CoA when the cells were 
cultivated on glycerol as carbon source (Aldor et al., 2002). 
 Further examples of the use of metabolic  engineering for the production of P(3HB-
co-3HV) co-polymer have been discussed in Chapter 7.  
 
         
 
            Introduction 
 351.9 Aims of the project 
The aim of the study is to understand the metabolic role of methylmalonyl-CoA 
mutase in Escherichia coli  and the use of the mutase in metabolic engineering. The 
aim was intended to be achieved by 
1. Comparing the growth of a mutant ( sbm gene inactivated) and wild type E. 
coli in glucose, succinate or propionate as the sole source of carbon. We will 
be focussing specifically on these gr owth conditions because available 
literature indicates the po ssible importance of the E. coli  methylmalonyl-
CoA mutase in the utilisa tion of these carbon sources.  
2. Identifying a promoter region to de termine the possibl e conditions under 
which MCM could be induced.  
3. Determining the mRNA copy number corr esponding to the four genes of the 
sbm operon under growth conditions with succinate and propi onate as sole 
sources of carbon and growth in minima l media with glucose as the sole 
source of carbon as a control. This w ill allow the estimation of the level of 
transcription of these genes under th e specified conditions. The mRNA will 
be estimated using RT-PCR first and la ter using the real-time quantitative 
PCR technique. 
4. Assaying for the activity of  methylmalonyl-CoA mutase  in whole cell extract 
using the high performance liquid chro matography (HPLC) technique, from 
cells grown in minimal media with succina te or propionate as sole sources of 
carbon and comparing with a control assa y with extract from cells grown in 
minimal media with glucose as the sole source of carbon. 
5. Expression proteomics to understa nd the global changes in protein 
expression, including that of Sbm, unde r specific growth conditions with 
glucose, succinate or propiona te as sole source of carbon  
6. The cloning of the sbm gene from E. coli  into B. cereus ; this would be the 
first step forward towards metabolic engineering of B. cereus  leading to the 
production of the commercially impor tant biodegradable polymer, P(3HB-
co-3HV).

 Comparative growth analyses 
 362.1 Introduction 
Bacteria such as E. coli  have genes that are freque ntly clustered together and 
organised in operons that encode enzyme s responsible for a particular metabolic 
pathway. Occasionally, in prokaryotes, the operon organisation of genes may provide clues for the identification of unknown proteins, if the functions  of the other 
proteins encoded by the genes in the operon are known (Haller et al. , 2000 & Bobik 
and Rasche, 2001). 
 About 40% of the identified open readi ng frames (ORFs) in bacteria encode 
proteins of unknown function or whose me tabolic role is uncertain (Haller et al ., 
2000). Energy production and metabolite inter-c onversions in cells are mainly being 
studied in vitro  using purified enzymes and subs trates, under non-physiological 
conditions, and extrapolated in an a ttempt to understand whole cell metabolism 
(Evans et al. , 1993). However, understanding a gene's metabolic role in vitro  should 
ultimately lead to the understanding of  the function of the gene product in vivo  
(Bobik and Rasche, 2001).  
Although the genome of E. coli  has been sequenced (Berlyn, 1998) many of the 
proteins encoded by various genes are yet to be characterised and among those that 
have been characterised, the metabolic role of some are unclear. One such protein is 
the coenzyme B 12-dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl -CoA mutase (MCM), encoded 
by the sbm gene. 
 MCM plays an important role in propionate metabolism in both mammals and bacteria. In mammals the enzyme is invol ved in the breakdown of odd chain fatty 
acids. In P. shermanii , MCM catalyses the interconve rsion of methylmalonyl-CoA 
and succinyl-CoA as a part of the propionate fermentation pathway (Roy, 1996) and in S. erythraea  the isomerisation of succinyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA is 
involved in the synthesis of the precur sor for erythromycin production (Hunaiti and 
Kolattukudi, 1984). In E. coli,  the MCM containing pathway has also been thought 
to be involved in propionate metabolism  (Evans et al., 1993). Further,  Haller (2000) 
determined that the sbm gene codes for MCM in E. coli  and that it is a part of the Comparative growth analyses 
 37four gene operon possibly re sponsible for the decarbo xylation of succinate to 
propionate (Haller et al ., 2000). A detailed account of  propionate and succinate 
metabolism in E. coli  is provided in Section 1.7 of Chapter 1. On the basis of this 
literature, succinate or propionate were chosen as the sole carbon sources for the 
current study, with growth on glucose as the control. This was carried out to determine the likely role of the sbm gene in the metabolism of these carbon sources. 
 In order to understand the possible ro le of MCM in unusual carbon source 
utilisation, a mutant wi th the non functional sbm gene was created previously (I. 
Roy, unpublished data). The sbm gene was inactivated by a Mu dJ insertion 
mutation and was created using S. typhimurium  LT2 and a temperature sensitive Pol 
A mutant (Pol A
-) of E. coli . This was then used for the comparative growth analysis 
of the wild type TR6524 and mutant FA1P1 in glucose, succinate or propionate as 
the sole source of carbon in a chemica lly defined minimal media. Firstly, the 
mutation was verified and confirmed and then the growth curves for both the wild type E .coli  strain, TR6524 and the mutant E. coli  strain, FA1P1 were plotted and 
the results compared.  
The presence of vitamin B
12 in the growth media has shown to decrease the lag 
phase from 90 hours to 70 hours when E. coli  was grown in minimal media with 
propionate as the sole s ource of carbon (Kolodziej et al ., 1968 & Wegener  et al., 
1968). Vitamin B 12 is expected to affect the level of expression of the sbm gene 
since MCM is a vitamin B 12-dependent enzyme. Hence, comparative growth studies 
were carried out using diffe rent concentrations (0.05, 0.5 or 5.0µg/ml) of vitamin 
B12. The choice of the concentration of vitamin B 12 (0.5µg/ml) was based on the 
conditions used in previous studies (Wegener et al., 1968 & Evans et al., 1993).

 382.2 Results 
2.2.1 Verification of the disruption mutation in the sbm gene 
The disruption mutation in the sbm gene is represented as shown in Figure 2.1. 
Firstly, this mutation was verified using P CR. The primer pairs used in the reaction 
were iciA2-R55 and sbm11-F33 (primer sequences and PCR conditions are 
described in Tables 9.1 and 9.2, respectively). The primers iciA2 and sbm11 were 
based on sequences upstream and downstream of the sbm gene in the E. coli  
chromosome. Genomic DNA (gDNA) templates from the mutant strain (FA1P1) and from the wild type strain (TR6524) (as nega tive control) were us ed for the reaction.

It can be observed from Figure 2.2 that the expected products were formed under 
two of the three annealing temperatures tested (55oC and 60oC), however, at an 
annealing temperature of 65oC only one product was formed . In order that the PCR 
was performed at the most stringent condition possible, 60oC and 1.5mM 
magnesium chloride were chosen and the P CR was repeated to check for consistency 
and the products obtained are shown in Figure 2.3.

The PCR reactions with primer pairs iciA2-R55 and F33-sbm11 and FA1P1 gDNA 
as template (Figure 2.1) formed a 1.2kbp product and 2.1kbp product respectively, 
thus confirming the presence of the Mu  dJ insertion within the sbm gene (Figure 
2.3). Since Mu dJ is kn own to insert anywhere  in the genome there  is no specific 
size expected in this case. There were no products formed with these primers when 
gDNA from TR6524 was used as the template , as expected, confirming the absence 
of the Mu  dJ insertion in the TR6524 genome. In the reaction with iciA2-sbm11 
primer pair, a 3.4kbp product was formed when gDNA template from TR6524 was 
used. This is the expected size of the amplified sbm gene along with a part of the

 41iciA gene. The reaction using the primer pair iciA2 and sbm11 with genomic DNA 
from FA1P1 as the template did not  give a product as the inserted Mu  dJ is 
approximately 11kbp in size and hence the resulting product size would be 15kbp which is too large a product to be fo rmed under the reaction conditions used.  
 These results confirmed the disruption mutation in the sbm gene. Hence the Kan
r 
(kanamycin resistant) transductant with the Mu dJ insertion in the sbm gene, as 
verified by PCR, was established as the sbm-disrupted mutant. The insertion is 
represented as shown in Figure 2.1. This mutation would allow the comparison of 
wild type E. coli  TR6524 and the mutant strain (F A1P1) lacking the functional gene. 
 
2.2.2 Comparative growth analyses 
Growth of the two strains (wild type TR 6524 and mutant FA1P1) in minimal media 
with glucose, succinate or propionate as  the sole source of carbon and in the 
presence of 3 different concentrat ions (0.05, 0.5, 5.0µg/ml) of vitamin B 12 was 
studied. Growth in minimal media with glucose as the sole source of carbon was 
used as a control condition.  
2.2.2.1 Growth studies with glucose as the sole source of carbon

noticeable lag phase for the wild type , TR6524 and the mutant, FA1P1 and the 
stationary phase of growth was observed to  have been reached within 7-8 hours of 
growth, for both strains, in all growth c onditions (consolidated curves, Figure 2.4a). 
There was no significant difference in the growth pattern between the wild type and mutant strains.  
 
2.2.2.2 Growth studies with succinate as sole carbon source 
The possible role of the sbm gene in succinate utilisati on has been proposed (Haller 
et al ., 2000) . Hence, the wild type and the mutant E. coli  strains were grown in 
minimal medium with succinate as the so le source of carbon. The results of the 
growth of the two strains in minimal medi a with succinate as the sole source of 
carbon, in the presence of the thr ee concentrations of vitamin B 12 are shown in

 55Figures 2.5b, c, and d show that, under the specified conditions of growth, the wild 
type TR6524 grows better than the mutant  FA1P1 strain unde r all the conditions 
tested. The wild type TR6524 reached the stationary phase at about 15 hours of 
growth while the mutant, FA1P1, on the ot her hand, reached stationary phase at 24 
hours (an appreciable 9 hours later than th at observed for the wild type TR6524).   
These results indicate that the sbm gene possibly has a role in the utilisation of 
succinate in E. coli .  
 A noticeable difference between the growth patterns of the two strains was observed 
as seen in Figures 2.5b, c and d. The grow th curve for the wild type, TR6524, was 
similar to that observed for glucose (Figur es 2.4b, c and d) in all growth conditions 
while the mutant, FA1P1, was observed to  lag behind throughout the period of its 
growth until about the 25
th hour, since the beginning of the growth. The mutant 
strain (FA1P1) showed a distinctly diffe rent growth pattern and was observed to 
have a slower growth compared to that of  the wild type in all growth conditions 
used. This was a major difference noticed in the growth pattern of the mutant strain 
indicating the role of the sbm gene in the utilisation of succinate, thus confirming the 
postulate made by Haller et al. (2000).  
 
2.2.2.3 Growth studies with propionate as sole carbon source  
The methylmalonyl-CoA mutase pathway has been reported to be one of the 
pathways involved in the ut ilisation of propionate by E. coli  (Evans et al ., 1993; 
Textor et al., 1997 & London et al., 1999). Hence, in order to further explore the 
role of the sbm gene in the utilisation of propionate , the wild type and mutant strains 
of E. coli  were grown in minimal media with prop ionate as the sole source of carbon 
in the presence of the three differe nt concentrations of vitamin B 12. The results 
obtained are shown in Figures 2.6a-f.

 62the wild type was slightly better in the presence of 5.0µg/ml vitamin B 12 than in the 
presence of 0.05µg/ml or 0.5µg/ml vitamin B 12 (Figure 2.6e). A similar observation 
was not made in the case of the mutant  (Figure 2.6f). Although, the mutant strain 
lacked a functional Sbm, its growth was not  significantly affected unlike the growth 
of the mutant in minimal media with succi nate as the sole s ource of carbon (Figure 
2.5c, d and e). One of the other pathways (Textor et al., 1997) possibly compensated 
for the inactive, vitamin B 12 utilising MCM pathway. Ov erall, the only difference 
observed with the growth of both strains wa s that the wild type strain entered the 
stationary phase slightly earli er than the mutant strain. 
  
2.3 Discussion 
The growth of the wild type, TR6524 and the mutant, FA1P1 in minimal media with 
glucose, succinate or propionate as the sole  source of carbon and in the presence of 
0.05, 0.5, 5.0µg/ml vitamin B 12 have been established. It  could be observed from 
these curves that neither of  the strains had any lag phase. The absence of a lag phase 
in minimal media with unusual carbon sour ces such as succinate and propionate 
could be due to the use of exponential phase cultures, previously adapted to the media in small scale (Section 9.2.2), to inoc ulate the appropriate large scale volumes 
that were subsequently used for the grow th analyses, thus, allowing the cells to 
continue their growth in th e exponential phase (Mendelstam et al., 1982 & Ingraham 
et al., 1983). 
 
2.3.1 Growth of E. coli  TR6524 and FA1P1 on glucose 
Glucose is the simplest and the most favoured carbon source for E. coli . Growth of 
the two strains TR6524 and FA1P1 on this carbon source was used as a control to 
measure the possible differences observed in the growth patte rns on succinate or 
propionate when these fatty acids are used  as the sole sour ce of carbon in M9 
minimal media.    Comparative growth analyses 
 63 
Table 2.1: Measurement of E. coli  growth in glucose. The growth rate, doubling time and 
number of doublings/hour were measured for E. coli  TR6524 and FA1P1 in minimal media 
with glucose as the sole source of carbon in the presence of 0.05, 0.5 and 5.0µg/mL vitamin B 12. 
 There is no noticeable difference in the patte rn of growth observed with the change 
in the concentration of vitamin B
12 in the medium. The growth  of the two strains in 
glucose was also quantified and the grow th rate, doubling time and doublings per 
hour measurements are as shown in Table 2.1.  Growth measurement information calculated from the curves shows that both strains, TR6524 and FA1P1, have very sim ilar growth rates with doubling times of 
0.38 - 0.40 hour under all conditions of growth, irrespective of the concentration of 
vitamin B
12 in the media. This showed that the pathway employing the sbm gene 
product (MCM) was not crucial in the utilisa tion of glucose. This  was also indicative 
of the fact that MCM was po ssibly induced only under specif ic conditions of growth.  
 
2.3.2  Growth of E. coli  TR6524 and FA1P1 on succinate  
Kolodziej et al. (1968) showed that the lag phase of E. coli  E26 was reduced to 65 
hours from 90 hours when the bacteria was a llowed to grow in the propionate media 
with limiting concentrations (0.5µmoles /ml) of succinate and suggested that 
succinate and propioante metabolism invol ved the use of common enzyme systems 
(Kolodziej et al., 1968). Only a few previous studies have used succinate as a source Strain and growth condition Growth rate,

 64of carbon for E. coli  growth (Liu et al., 2005 & Paliy and Gunasekara, 2007). So this 
study attempted to unders tand the growth of E. coli  in succinate and eventually the 
metabolic context of MCM in succinate metabolism in the bacteria.   The growth study of the wild type and the mutant strains in minimal media with 
succinate as the sole source of carbon wa s inspired by the obs ervations of Haller et 
al. (2000). The relatively sl ower growth and the delay in reaching the stationary 
phase for the mutant strain during growth in minimal media with succinate as the 
sole source of carbon confirms, for the fi rst time, the hypothesis made by Haller and 
co-workers (2000), i.e., the sbm containing operon was involved in the 
decarboxylation of succinate to propionate (Haller et al ., 2000). This is the first 
experimental verification of the role of the sbm gene product in succ inate utilisation. 
 The vitamin B
12 in the medium would not only compliment the Sbm, which is a B 12-
dependent enzyme but the use of three di fferent concentrations would help to 
conclusively see its effect on MCM and ulti mately on the growth of the wild type 
and the mutant E. coli  strains. Growth rate, doubling time and the number of 
doublings per hour were calculated and the results are s hown in Table 2.2.

 65Unlike the growth curves for the two strains in minimal media with glucose, the wild 
type (TR6524) and the mutant (FA1P1) s howed a significant difference in their 
growth pattern in media with succinate as the sole carbon source (Figure 2.5a), 
indicating the possibility of utilisation of succinate via the MCM pathway. This was 
further reiterated by the growth measurem ent values shown in Table 2.2. The wild 
type cells were observed to have do ubling times of 0.54, 0.59 and 0.61 hours in the 
presence of 0.05, 0.5, 5.0µg/ml vitamin B 12, respectively, while the sbm mutant was 
observed to have ‘g’ values of 1.19, 1.21 and 1.22 hours in 0.05, 0.5, 5.0µg/ml 
vitamin B 12, respectively. Also, number of doubli ngs/ hour (µ) for the wild type 
(TR6524) was twice that of the mutant, FA1P 1 (Table 2.2). It is obvious that, in the 
absence of a functional sbm gene, the mutant cannot ut ilise succinate through the 
MCM pathway and hence shows relatively slow er growth than the wild type strain. 
The absence any effect of the incr easing concentration of vitamin B 12 (Figure 2.5f 
and Table 2.2) on the growth of the sbm mutant (FA1P1) is expected since MCM 
(encoded by sbm gene), which possibly is involved in  the utilisation of succinate, is 
coenzyme B 12 dependent and this strain has its sbm gene inactivated. The absence of 
any appreciable difference in the growth pattern within TR6524 with change in B 12 
concentration (Figure 2.5e) could be indi cative of a saturation of the required B 12 
concentration at 0.05µg/mL. Recent report s have indicated the presence of a B 12 
riboswitch (described in Section 3.1.1.4) upstream of the btuB gene responsible for 
the transportation of external B 12 into the E. coli  cell. These RNA elements 
selectively bind vitamin B 12 and control btuB gene expression in response to high 
ligand concentrations (Vitreschak et al., 2003 & Nahvi et al., 2004) in turn affecting 
the functioning of coenzyme B 12-dependent MCM.  
 The results from the growth of the two st rains in minimal media with succinate as 
the sole carbon source indicate that the sbm gene is important for succinate uptake. 
These results show for the first time that the sbm gene product of E. coli  is important 
for its growth on succinate.  
 
 Comparative growth analyses 
 662.3.3 Growth of E. coli  TR6524 and FA1P1on propionate 
Propionate is a common carbon source encountered by E. coli  in the colon as a result 
of the oxidation of odd ch ain fatty acids (Textor et al.,  1997; Polen et al.,  2002 & 
Nelson and Cox, 2005). Previous  studies have indicat ed that vitamin B 12 in the 
minimal medium with propionate as the so le source of carbon had reduced lag phase 
of the wild type E. coli  to 70 hours from 90 hours (Kolodziej et al., 1968 & Wegener 
et al., 1968). Also, cells previously adapted to  propionate have been shown to have a 
reduced lag phase when grown on propionate as the sole source of carbon indicating 
that growth using propionate is an ad aptive process requiring the induction of 
specific enzyme systems (Kolodziej et al., 1968). In this stu dy, similar observations 
were made and the wild type E. coli  K12 grew without a lag phase in minimal media 
with propionate as the sole source of carbon. The di fference in the growth of the 
wild type in the presence of the vitamin B 12 indicates the possibility of the 
involvement of the Sbm prot ein in propionate utilisation. The absence of lag phases 
observed in this case compared to that reported by Wegener et al. (1968) is due to 
the fact that the cultures of E. coli  K12 in this work have been previously adapted 
for growth in propionate mini mal media in addition to it be ing a different strain of E. 
coli. 
 
In all the growth condi tions with propionate as the sole source of carbon (Figures 2.6 
b-d), it was observed that the growth of the wild type strain TR6524 was marginally 
better than that of the mutant FA1P1. Table 2.3 shows the growth rate, doubling 
time and the number of doublings/ hour for the two strains in minimal media with 
propionate as the sole source of carbon.

Table 2.3: Measurement of E. coli  growth in propionate. The growth rate, doubling time and 
number of doublings/hour were measured for E. coli  TR6524 and FA1P1 in minimal media 
with propionate as the sole source of carbon in  the presence of 0.05, 0. 5 and 5.0µg/mL vitamin 
B12  
 
The growth curves (Figures 2.6 a-f) and the data shown in Table 2.3 indicate that the 
growth patterns of the w ild type and the mutant E. coli  strains do not differ 
significantly (as indicated by the growth rate and the doubl ings/hour values). Also, 
with an increase in the vitamin B 12 concentration only a sli ghtly better growth and 
marginally decreased doubling time for th e wild type strain was observed. This 
indicates that the coenzyme B 12-dependent MCM pathway is not significantly 
important in propiona te utilisation in E. coli . In the case of FA1P1, the sbm gene is 
non functional due to the Mu dJ inser tion. Hence, the variation in the B 12 
concentration or even the presence of vitamin B 12 in the growth medium had no 
effect on the growth of the strain. This  ability of the wild type and mutant E. coli  
strains to grow in minimal media with  propionate shows that there are other 
pathways (including the methylcitrate pa thway) that compensate allowing the 
bacteria to grow as observed from the gr owth curves. Nevertheless, the increase in 
the concentration of vitamin B 12 had a slight positive influence on the growth of the 
wild type E. coli  strain TR6524. This c ould be indication of the functioning of B 12 
dependent pathway for propionate utilisa tion and in turn of the role of B 12 dependent 
MCM in propionate utilisation.  Comparative growth analyses 
 68 
From these results, it is evident that E. coli  uses multiple pathways (possibly MCM 
pathway and five other) for propionate ut ilisation, as previously reported (Textor et 
al., 1997). From the comparative growth an alyses of the w ild type TR6524 and 
mutant FA1P1, there is an indication that in the presence of vitamin B 12, E. coli  
might utilise propionate through the carboxylation pathway ( via MCM). The minor 
differences in the growth pattern of the mutant with changes in B 12 concentration 
could be due to the presence of utilisable metabolites from other pathways that may possess B
12 dependent enzymes thus helping the mutant in the media with a higher 
B12 (5.0µg/ml) concentration grow slightly be tter than the FA1P1 strain growing in 
media with lesser B 12 (0.05 or 0.5 µg/ml) concentr ation. The growth of the sbm 
mutant on propionate possibly utilises the ot her pathways including the methylcitrate 
pathway as there is no competition from the MCM pathway  for the propionyl CoA. 
This is in accordance with the findings of Textor et al., 1997 and Evans et al., 1993. 
 Thus, overall we can conclude that the di fference in growth between the wild type 
cells and the mutant strain in propionate is no t as markedly different  as in the case of 
growth on succinate. This can be attributed to the fact that E. coli  is known to have 
numerous pathways for propionate utilisation, hence in the case of the mutant strain 
the other pathways compensate quite well for the lack of the Sbm pathway (Kolodziej et al., 1968 & Textor et al., 1997).

 Promoter analysis 
 693.1 Introduction 
Transcription of a number of genes within  bacterial cells is induced resulting in 
protein synthesis required to su rvive environmental stresses. E. coli has been shown 
to survive environments characterise d by nutrient scarcit y, starvation, limited 
oxygen availability, toxic chemical s, and high osmolarity (Wise et al ., 1996; 
Alexeeva et al., 2003 & Levanon et al., 2005). Promoter sequences upstream of a 
gene can indicate the conditions  in which a gene product is  expressed. The specific 
condition required for the initiation of tr anscription at a promoter sequence is 
governed by the sigma ( σ) factor, which binds to the core RNA polymerase (RNAP) 
complex to form the RNAP holoenzym e (Burgess, 1969; Hengge-Aronis, 2002a & 
Hengge-Aronis, 2002c). Table 3.1 provides a list  of the different sigma factors, the 
gene family they specifically induce and the promoter sequences to which they specifically bind (Helmann and Cham berlin, 1988; Hengge-Aronis, 2002a & 
Hengge-Aronis, 2002c).

Table 3.1: Different si gma factors and their reco gnition se quencesPromoter analysis 
 70E. coli  promoters are categorised into th ree classes (Figure 3.1) based on the 
relationship between their expression leve l and the rate of cell growth (Vicente et 
al., 1991). The housekeeper promot ers are constantly acti ve independent of the 
growth rate, the stringent promoters are de pendent on the growth rate, being more 
active at higher growth rate and gearbox pr omoters, whose activities are inversely 
related to the growth rate (Tanaka et al., 1993). 
           
Figure 3.1: An equilibrium model representing  the 3 classes of promoters. The two circles 
represent sets of promoters, each of which is  active in the exponential phase and/or in 
stationary phase. Eq uilibrium of the two principal sigma factors determines the overall balance 
of cellular transcription. The predominance of σ70 or σS results in a shift of the balance in the 
direction indicated by the arrow (Tanaka et al., 1993). 
 
3.1.1 Regulators of gene expression 
The ability of E. coli  to grow under a wide range of environmental conditions owing 
to its catabolic flexib ility is recognised by its respons e to differences in the growth 
environment (Alexeeva et al ., 2003). E. coli  cells respond to these fluctuations by 
altering the expression of a nu mber of membrane associated nutrient uptake or 
excretion systems and metabolic pathways  to modulate the carbon and energy flow 
(Salmon et al ., 2003). This regulation is mediated at the transcriptional level by 
regulatory networks of which the well stud ied and characterised regulons pertaining 
to this study are briefly discussed below.  σ 70

 713.1.1.1 Sigma ( σ) factors as gene expression regulators 
The principal σ factor, σ70, potentiates the transcripti on of genes controlled by the 
consensus promoters consisting of two hexanucleotide sequences, TTGACA and 
TATAAT, in exponentially growing E. coli . Other species of σ factors recognise 
different sets of promoter sequences, each being associated with a limited number of 
genes that are mostly expressed in response to various stress conditions as listed in Table 3.1 (Helmann and Chamberlin, 1988).   One of the alternat e sigma factors, σS (also known as σ
38), encoded by the rpoS  
gene, (due to its importance in stationary  phase or ‘under stre ss’ conditions) is a 
sigma subunit of RNA polymerase in E. coli that is induced and can partially replace 
the vegetative sigma factor σ70 under many stress conditions (Hengge- Aronis, 
2002a & Hengge-Aronis, 2002c). The σS subunit of RNA polymerase (or RpoS) is 
reported as the master regulator of  the general stress response in E. coli  (Fischer et 
al., 1998). σS induces the transcription of many genes whose products help the cell 
to cope with various environmental st resses. Stationary phase induction is 
characteristic of σS dependent genes. Many σS dependent genes ( bolA , otsBA , treA, 
osmB , osmY , and pexB ) have been reported to be induced by hyperosmotic stress 
during exponential growth in a defined minimal medium (Wise et al., 1996 & Polen 
et al., 2003). While σS levels are low in rapidly gr owing cells not exposed to any 
particular stress, it is induced in respons e to a variety of environmental stress 
conditions that include starvation for vari ous nutrients and stationary phase in 
general. The cellular content of the σS protein has been observed to increase during 
stationary phase, thus correlating with σS dependent gene induction (Fischer et al., 
1998). Metabolism is also affected by σS controlled genes, consistent with σS being 
important under conditions where cells switch from maximal growth to 
maintenance. σS control of genes mediating progr ammed cell death in stationary 
phase by sacrificing some of the populati on to provide nutrients for the remaining 
surviving cells, increases the survival rate for bacterial population under stressful conditions (Hengge- Aronis, 2002b).  Promoter analysis 
 72It has been shown that σS and σS dependent genes not only are induced in stationary 
phase and starvation conditions, but actua lly respond to many different stress 
conditions including hype rosmolarity (Muffler et al., 1996), heat shock (Muffler et 
al., 1997) and acid tolerance (Lee et al., 1995), leading to th e popular belief that σS 
is the master regulator of the general stress response trigge red by many different 
stress signals (Weber et al., 2005). 
 
3.1.1.2 FNR regulon 
FNR is a catabolic activator protein (CAP) homologue that contains an oxygen labile 
iron-sulfur centre as a sensor el ement for anaerobiosis. Mutations in the fnr gene 
affect the synthesis of nitrite, nitrate, and fumarate reductases as well as fermentation 
pathway genes. Over 70 genes in 31 operons have been recognised as members of 
the FNR gene regulatory network (Lambden and Guest, 1976 & Salmon et al ., 
2003). The primary role for FNR is r ecognised to be the coordination of carbon and 
energy metabolism during growth under anaerobic conditions (Salmon et al., 2003 & 
Levanon et al., 2005). 
 E. coli  controls its response to oxygen
 availability by altering its gene expression 
pattern. Under oxygen limiting conditions, expression of genes involved in oxygen 
utilisation are switched off and expression of genes encoding alternative anaerobic 
electron transport pathways or genes needed for fermentation are switched on. Many 
of these metabolic transitions are controlled at the transcriptional level by the 
activities of the global regulatory protein, FNR. (Salmon et al., 2003 & Levanon et 
al., 2005) 
Many of the genes affected  by oxygen availability are involved in aerobic or 
anaerobic electron transport processes, carbon flow through the Krebs cycle and/or 
fermentation, small molecule biosynthesis,  macromolecular synthe sis, and a variety 
of nutrient uptake or nutrient excretion reactions. In  a recent study carried out by 
Salmon et al . (2003), the analysis of microarray  data obtained to understand the 
global gene expression pattern of E. coli , in the presence and absence of oxygen, 
demonstrated that the expression of over a th ird of the genes during growth under Promoter analysis 
 73aerobic conditions were altered when E. coli  cells made a transition to an anaerobic 
growth state, and that the expression of 712 of these genes were  either directly or 
indirectly modulated by FNR (Salmon et al., 2003).  
3.1.1.3 ArcAB regulon 
The ArcAB (microaerobic respiratory contro l) is a two component regulatory system 
composed of ArcA, the cytosolic response re guator and a membrane associated 
histidine kinase, ArcB. Genes for the TCA cycle ( sdh-CDAB, icd, fumA, mdh, gltA, 
acnA , and acnB ), for pyruvate metabolism and superoxide dismutase ( pfl and sodA ), 
and genes for the cytochrome o oxidase (cyoABCDE) and cytochrome d oxidase are 
some of the genes controlled by ArcA (Lynch and Lin, 1996; Alexeeva et al., 2003; 
Salmon et al., 2003 & Levanon et al., 2005).   
 Originally thought to be involved in the control of transcription of genes under 
aerobic growth conditions (Salmon et al., 2003), a recent observation by Levanon et 
al, (2005) showed that the ArcAB regulator was rather involved with the ability of 
E. coli  to grow under microaerobic, oxygen rest ricted growth conditions. Elevated 
levels of FNR regulated genes in Arc mutants of E. coli  indicated a complex 
network formed by these regulatory proteins (Levanon et al., 2005). 
 
3.1.1.4 Riboswitches 
Recently, a new class of gene expression re gulators called riboswitches have been 
identified (Nahvi et al ., 2002). Riboswitches serve as ligand-responsive genetic 
control elements that modulate the expre ssion of certain genes in response to 
changing concentrations of metabolites. These RNA elements are embedded within the 5’ untranslated region (5 ′-UTR) of specific prokaryotic mRNAs, and are 
composed of two functional and sometimes distinct structural domains. One domain serves as a natural aptamer that binds th e target metabolite with high selectivity 
while the other domain is an ‘expression plat form’ that harnesses allosteric changes 
in RNA structure, brought about by apta mer-ligand complex formation, to control 
expression of the adjacent gene or operon (Vitreschak et al., 2003 & Nahvi et al., 
2004). Examination of a 202-nucleotide fragment of the 5 ′-UTR of the btuB  gene of Promoter analysis 
 74E. coli  and the homologous mRNA fragment for S. typhimurium  confirmed that an 
mRNA domain directly binds to a metabolite in the absen ce of proteins indicating its 
function as a metabolite-dependent genetic control element (Nahvi et al ., 2002). 
Both RNAs bind coenzyme B 12 with high affinity and sp ecificity, and thus function 
as natural aptamers. These RNAs, along with the 5 ′-UTR of the cob gene have been 
shown to carry a short conserved sequence domain termed the B 12 box. Genes under 
the control of a coenzyme B 12 riboswitch are involved in the transport of cobalamin 
compounds or metals, or associated with the biosynthetic pathway for the coenzyme 
(as in the case of S. typhimurium ). Global analysis of the B 12 elements in available 
bacterial genomes has shown that this c onserved RNA regulator y element, widely 
distributed in eubacteria, is involved  in the control of gene expression by 
transcription termination in Gram positive ba cteria and at the translational level in 
Gram negative bacteria (Nahvi et al., 2002 & Nahvi et al., 2004).  
Salmon et al. (2003) identified a putative FNR recognition sequence upstream of the 
sbm gene. An increase in the sbm gene expression (transcr iption) during anaerobic 
growth of E. coli  indicated a possible relation be tween FNR and Sbm. However, 
they were unable to discuss the significance or the effect of this in their report. In addition, many genes shown to be regulated by
 Lrp (leucine responsive protein) were 
also found to be regulated by FNR (Salmon et al ., 2003).  The global regulatory 
protein Lrp has been reported to affect σS and/or σ70 selectivity of many promoters 
indicating that certain elements of the σS-dependent general stress response are 
employed by stress-specific regulons, wh ich are controlled  by other stress-
responsive regulators that  act together with σ70 RNAP, suggesting functional 
interactions between global  regulatory networks (Tani et al., 2002 & Weber et al., 
2005). 
With these findings and reports as the basi s, the current work attempted to locate 
suitable regulon binding sites in order to determine conditions in which the sbm gene 
might be transcribed and possibly indicat e the metabolic role of the gene.  
 Promoter analysis 
 753.2 Results  
3.2.1 Regulon recognition sites 
σ70 and σS are highly related to one another. Genes transcribed by σS in vivo  have 
been found to be transcribed by σ70 in vitro  (and the reverse bei ng equally efficient). 
This has made the identification of a σS consensus promoter sequence and the 
prediction of σS-controlled promoters in upstr eam regions of genes in the E. coli 
genome difficult (Weber et al., 2005).   
 
A search was carried out to locate c onserved sigma factor binding sequences 
upstream of the sbm-containing operon. Different sp acer lengths from 15 to 19 
spaces were explored between the -35 and -10 region. A putative σS binding site     
(-35: CGTCAA; -10: CTNNTATAAT) that promotes the expression of genes under 
stress conditions or stati onary phase conditions was f ound 29 base pairs upstream of 
the sbm start codon, as shown in Figure 3.2

There were 16 spaces between the -35 (CGTAAA ) and the -10 (CAAATACCCT) sequences in

The putative -35 region found upstream of the sbm gene aligned with 83% sequence

50% similar to the known cons ensus sequence (Figure 3.2).  
 A similar search carried out in an at tempt to identify putative binding sites

  Figure 3.3 shows the possibility  of the presence of an Ar cA binding site with a 45%

regulation of genes responsible for aer obic and/or microaerobic growth of 
Escherichia coli .

The search for a putative  binding site upstream of sbm was based on the findings of 
Salmon et al . (2003). It was reported that th e FNR binding site was present

using the Multalin pr ogram (Corpet, 1988).

align the FNR consensus at about 139 base pairs upstream of the sbm gene (Figure

 A similar search for a puta tive binding site for the B
12 box upstream of the sbm gene 
returned no match indicati ng the absence of the B 12 box upstream of the sbm gene. 
However, the B 12 ribowitches affect the expression of btuB gene (Vitreschak et al., 
2003 & Nahvi et al., 2004), the gene product of wh ich is involved in vitamin B 12 
uptake in E. coli . This in turn could affect the formation of Sbm holoenzyme and 
eventually the utilisation of succinate and propionate via the MCM pathway.  
 
3.3 Discussion 
Since E. coli  lives in rapidly changing environm ents, its survival depends on its 
ability to regulate its gene expression to produce enzymes capable of transporting 
proteins required for the growth and metabolism of the cell in the new environment (Magasanik, 2000). The genera l stress sigma factor σS is strongly induced when E. 
coli cells are exposed to various stress conditions including growth on unusual 
carbon sources such succinate or propiona te as the sole sources of carbon. The 
presence of σS
 binding site upstream of the sbm gene indicates that the genes of the 
sbm operon may be involved in pathways rela ted to stationary phase of growth or 
glucose starvation, since σS is the key regulato r under such conditions. σS has been 
reported as the inducer of transcripti on of over 80 genes required to provide 
resistance and protection ag ainst stresses such as starva tion or unfavourable growth 
conditions (Hengge- Aronis, 2002 & Weber et al ., 2005). Thus, the conditions 
investigated in the work discussed in this  thesis are similar to the conditions of 
induction regulated by σS. 
 
Owing to its rapid kinetics and transient nature, the induction of σS has been 
identified to possess the characteristics of a rapid emergency response. The speed 
and the flexibility of E. coli ’s response to stress shows the remarkable ability of the 
bacteria to be able to survive frequent, rapid, and extreme changes in their growth Promoter analysis 
 78environments. Fischer et al . (1998) found that glucos e starvation during diauxic 
shift, in the presence of lactose, activated many σS dependent genes resulting in 
significant changes in physiology, including th e expression of a strong general stress 
resistance, and cellular morphology. This led to the conclusion that glucose 
starvation, even in the presence of a nother eventually utilisable carbon source 
(lactose), initially represents a stress condition that  the cells respond to by rapidly 
increasing their σS content and inhibiting the prot eolysis of this sigma factor 
(Fischer et al ., 1998). However, abrupt cessation of  growth, as for example, in 
response to sudden glucose starvation, onl y weakly (about tw o fold) increased σS 
transcription (Hengge-Aronis, 2002b).  Salmon et al . (2003) indicated th e expression of the sbm gene in the absence of 
oxygen suggesting the presence of a putat ive FNR binding site upstream of the sbm 
gene in E. coli  (Figure 3.4). This suggests that sbm is probably induced under 
anaerobic conditions of growth (Salmon et al ., 2003). E. coli  is a facultative 
anaerobe and is also found in the intestinal tract of highe r organisms where there is 
limited or no oxygen supply. This could lead  to metabolism through the fermentative 
pathway. Under certain circumstances the cell might have to utilise fatty acids such 
as propionate for energy production. Propiona te is initially c onverted to propionyl 
CoA which can then undergo oxidation (m ethylcitrate pathway) or carboxylation 
(MCM pathway). The carboxyl ation pathway requires the sbm gene product and, 
based on the finding by Salmon and co-wor kers (2003), could possibly be induced 
by FNR under anaer obic conditions.  
 It has been shown that gl obal regulatory proteins ( σ
70, σS, FNR, ArcA) function as a 
network and that two or more of these regulatory proteins, t ogether, control the 
expression of many genes (Hengge-Aronis et al ., 2002a; Hengge-Aronis, 2002b; 
Salmon et al., 2003 & Levanon et al., 2005). Wise et al. (1996) reported that DNA 
sequences at the -35 site of σS promoter form part of a discriminatory mechanism 
that confines transcription to conditi ons that increase th e availability of σS. This 
indicates the significance of  the 83% alignment at the -35 site of the putative σS Promoter analysis 
 79promoter upstream of the sbm gene. The identification of putative binding sites for 
σS (83% and 50% at the -35 and -10 regi ons, respectively), ArcA (45% sequence 
identity) and FNR (80% sequence id entity) regulons 104 and 139 bases, 
respectively, upstream of the sbm gene (Figures 3.3 and 3.4) confirms the possibility 
of a control of expression of this gene, and hence the operon, by a complex regulatory network of genetic control elem ents. It can be suggested that in the 
presence of difficult carbon sources  and under anaerobic conditions, the sbm gene is 
probably induced by both FNR and σS regulatory proteins.  
 Previous studies (Salmon et al ., 2003) used minimal medi a with glucose as the 
carbon source aiming only to understand the global gene regulation pattern of 
Escherichia coli . This study has provided an insight into possible conditions leading 
to the induction of the sbm gene expression in E. coli. For the first time, the possible 
involvement of the σS factor has been proposed in addition to the FNR and ArcA 
regulatory proteins. The findi ngs reported here can be confirmed by the use of 
microarray analysis or real time PCR quan tification of gene e xpression pattern under 
specific growth conditions corresponding to the conditions discussed above.  In this study aerobic growth in the pr esence of succinate and propi onate as the sole carbon 
source were investigated within which th e stress conditions due  to difficult carbon 
sources (propionate and succinate), gl ucose starvation and stationary phase 
conditions have been studied. This study is cove red in the next Chapter. In the 
future, analogous anaerobic conditions  will need to be investigated.

 Quantification of transcription 
 804.1 Introduction 
The conventional methods for mRNA quantifi cation such as Northern blotting or 
Ribonuclease protection assay are not comp letely sensitive to study low abundance 
mRNAs. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR in combination with real time recording of 
the amplification data has proven to be extremely useful in amplifying specific 
mRNAs (especially those present in low copy number) and has eliminated the variability associated with end point PCR, thus allowing routine and reliable 
quantitation of the PCR product. Currently , reverse transcription based assays are 
being widely used for characterising gene  expression patterns and comparing mRNA 
levels in different sample populations as these assays represen t a powerful tool for 
the detection and quantifica tion of mRNA (Bustin, 2002). 
 
4.1.1 Real time reverse-transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) 
4.1.1.1 History and chemistry 
Originally, Higuchi et al . (1993), pioneered the analys is of PCR kinetics by 
constructing a “real-time” system that incl uded ethidium bromide (to intercalate 
DNA), an adapted thermal cycler to irradiat e the samples with ultraviolet light and 
computer-controlled cooled camera to  detect the resulting fluorescence. 
Amplification caused an increase in th e DNA which bound to the ethidium bromide 
resulting in increased fluorescence. By pl otting the increase in fluorescence versus 
cycle number, amplification plots that provided a complete picture of the PCR 
process were produced (Higuchi et al., 1993). 
 The real-time, fluorescence-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) uses fluorescent reporter mo lecules to monitor the production of 
amplification products during each cycle of the PCR reaction by combining the 
nucleic acid amplification and detection steps into one  homogeneous assay thus 
making it simple, specific and sensitive for the detection and/or comparison of RNA 
levels (Bustin et al., 2005).

4.1.1.2 Reverse transcription and priming strategies 
The gene transcriptional level measurement by real time RT-PCR follows the 
successful reverse transcripti on (RT) of mRNA to cDNA. Th e RT step is critical for 
sensitive and accurate quantification, since it has been found that the RT reaction 
contributes to most of the variation in  the experimental de termination of mRNA 
quantities (Stahlberg et al., 2004).  
 
Reverse transcription involves the transc ription of RNA molecules to DNA using a 
reverse transcriptase. It has been repor ted that primer addition only increases 
efficiency of the reaction, although the r eaction can proceed without added primer a.

 83(Stahlberg et al., 2004). The three basic priming stra tegies, in general are based on 
oligo(dT) primer, random sequence primer s (random hexamers), and gene specific 
primers (Figure 4.3). Random hexamers are short oligomers of all possible 
sequences, usually 6 bases long, that c opy all RNA, including tRNA, rRNA and 
mRNA. These are recommended as the priming strategy of choice for total reverse 
transcription of prokaryotic mRNA owing to the simplicity in quantification when used with SYBR green I dye (Morrison et al., 1998 & Kubista et al., 2006).

strategies commonly used in reverse transcription (Kubista et al ., 2006). a. gene specific 
priming, b. oligo (dT) priming and c. random hexamer priming.  
 
Random hexamers were used for this study for the synthesis of a cDNA pool from total RNA as this maximises the number of  genes that can be assayed from a small 
RNA sample (Pfaffel, 2004).   Real time PCR is characterised by the detect ion of amplified product when it is first 
detected during the cycling rather than the amount of accumulated PCR product. The 
traditional RT-PCR measures data at the e nd-point (plateau), while real-time PCR 
collects data in the exponential phase of am plification. Also, an increase in reporter 
fluorescent signal is directly  proportional to the number of  amplicons generated and 
the system eliminates the need for post PCR processes (electr ophoresis of amplified TTTTAAAAA
c b aQuantification of transcription 
 84DNA) since the quantification occurs within a closed system and as a part of the 
reaction (Kubista et al., 2006 & Dorak, 2004). The use of threshold cycle (C t) values 
expands the range of quantitation as data is  collected for every cycle of PCR. The C t 
values are relatively less sensitive to the effects of PCR inhibitors as measurements 
are from the exponential phase where reaction components are not limiting as compared to end point PCR. The quantific ation of RNA (and DNA) is much more 
precise and reproducible as real time PC R relies on the threshold cycle values 
determined during the exponential ph ase of PCR rather than endpoint. 
 
4.1.1.3 Methods of transcription quantification- absolute and relative 
Absolute quantification of transcription he lps in the precise determination of the 
transcript copy number of the target ge ne present in the cell (Bustin, 2002). The 
calibration curves for absolute quantificat ion can be based on known concentrations 
of DNA, e.g., recombinant plasmid DNA (Bustin, 2002, Whelan et al ., 2003 & 
Pffafl, 2004), genomic DNA (Eleaume et al ., 2004), RT-PCR product or 
commercially synthesised oligonucleotide also referred to as ‘artif icial’ RNA (Pffafl, 
2004 & Hugget et al., 2005). In this study, ab solute quantifi cation of the target gene 
sequences was based on an external standard curve pl otted using known 
concentrations of real time RT-PCR products  of the respective genes. The standard 
curve was generated by plot ting the threshold cycle (C t) values against the logarithm 
of initial copy numbers. The transcript copy numbers of the target genes were 
calculated using this standard curve.  
 
Relative quantification determines the changes in steady state transcription of a gene 
and expresses it relative to the internal control RNA. The control gene is a housekeeping gene ( e.g., 18s or 16s RNA depending on the sample species, 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or β-actin) that is more 
abundant and remains constant, in proporti on to total RNA of the test samples. 
Therefore, the relative quantification does not require st andards with known 
concentrations and is based on the expressi on levels of a target gene versus a Quantification of transcription 
 85reference gene. The ratio of the C t values of the target to the reference gene is 
calculated and the relative expression is obtained (Bustin, 2002 & Pfaffl, 2004). 
 
4.1.2 The effect of nutrient conditi ons on the mRNA population of E. coli   
A DNA microarray study by Polen and co-wor kers (2003) aimed to reveal the gene 
expression changes during the short (50min ) and long (20 generations) term growth 
of E. coli  MG1655 on LB in the presence of the sodium salt of acet ate or propionate 
at a neutral pH. The adaptive responses to acetate and propionate were similar 
involving an increase in the expression levels of genes responsible for chemotaxis 
and motility, a decrease, in both cases, in  the expression of genes involved in the 
uptake and utilisation of carbon sources such as sugars ( e.g. maltose, galactose, 
trehalose), sugar alcohols (glycerol and sorb itol) and amino acids (serine, threonine, 
tryptophan and proline), suggesting catabol ite repression by acetate and propionate. 
Expression of σS dependent stress response genes (such as osmY, dps) were 
observed to increase, however, this was more pronounced after short term exposure 
to the stress of growing in  acetate or propionate. The ad aptive response analysis was 
carried out following 20 generations of growth of E. coli  MG1655 on propionate or 
acetate. Cells obtained following the growth on propionate showed an increase in the 
expression of threonine and isoleucine biosynthetic gene s and genes that confer 
multiple antibiotic resistance ( marRAB operon), however, none of the genes of the 
sbm operon were reported. Adaptation to propionate and acetate resulted in changes 
in the expression of   the genes of the sorbitol operon, but, the changes were extreme 
for acetate adapted cells compared to the c ontrol cells grown in its absence (Polen et 
al., 2003).  
 
Franchini and Egli (2006) al so used microarray technology to understand the cellular 
events at the transcription level during short-term and long -term adaptation of E. coli  
K12 under glucose limited conditions (possibl y similar to growth on succinate or 
propionate, since glucose is completely mi ssing from the medium used). Short-term 
and long-term adaptation were assessed by comparing the mRNA levels isolated 
after 40 or 500 hours of glucose limited cont inuous culture with those from batch Quantification of transcription 
 86culture with excess of gluc ose. A large number of genes encoding periplasmic 
binding proteins and proteins enc oded by the genes of the maltose ( mal/lam B) and 
galactose ( mgl/gal ) operons were upregulated, indicat ing that the cells are prepared 
for high-affinity uptake of different t ypes of carbon sources during glucose limited 
growth in continuous culture. A similar tr anscription pattern was observed for long-
term cultures but with lower expression levels than in the short-term adaptation. The patterns of upregulation were confirmed by real time RT-PCR (Franchini and Egli, 
2006).   In this study, the specific role of the sbm, ygfG, ygfH and argK genes in the 
utilisation of succinate or  propionate was investigated using real time RT-PCR.  E. 
coli TR6524 cells grown in minimal media with 0.5 μg of vitamin B
12 and with 
glucose, succinate or propionate as the sole source of carbon were chosen for all 
transcription quantification and later for pr oteomics (Chapter 6) analyses. The RNA 
from the mutant was also isolated from cells grown under these specific conditions 
to show the absence of the formati on of PCR products co rresponding to the sbm 
gene and hence all the genes of the operon, confirming their lack of transcription in 
the disruption mutant. This study enabled us  to understand the c ontrol on the levels 
of transcription of  the genes of the sbm operon and relate that to the results obtained 
from growth on glucose, succinate and prop ionate (Chapter 2) and with previous 
studies (Kolodziej et al., 1968; Wegener et al., 1968 & Evans et al., 1993). It was 
observed from Chapter 2, that, growth on gl ucose as the sole carbon source was not 
dependent on the sbm pathway and hence it was concluded that MCM was not 
important for glucose utilisation. Therefor e RNA isolated from glucose grown cells 
was used as the control in this study.

4.2.1 Total RNA isolation                 
Total RNA was isolated from both wild type and mutant E. coli  grown in minimal 
media with glucose, succinate or propionate  as the sole sources of carbon. The cells 
used were harvested from different phase s of growth. Figure 4.4 shows an agarose 
gel with isolated total RNA from  both wild type and mutant E. coli . The total RNA 
preparation includes the mRNA corresponding to the streaks (Figure 4.4) on the gel 
and the ribosomal RNA corres ponding to the two thick bands, which can be clearly 
seen in all the samples. The bright spots at the bottom of the ge l are indicative of 
degradation during the isolation process.

the agarose gels. The ratio of th e amount of mRNA related to the sbm gene and the 
mRNA related to the internal standard hisG was compared (a graphical 
representation is shown in Figure 4.6) under the three di fferent growth conditions 
(glucose, succinate or propi onate as the sole source of  carbon). As expected, the 
FA1P1 strain, being a sbm insertion mutant, did not fo rm any PCR product as there 
would have been no mRNA produced corresponding to the sbm gene.

 91The gel (Figure 4.7) showed a good amplification of the sbm gene product of 
appropriate size. However, several attempts had to be made to optimise the PCR 
conditions in order to obtain these resu lts. The ratio of the intensities of the sbm gene 
product to that of hisG gene product obtained following the densitometric analysis 
are represented as shown in Figure 4.8.

grown in succinate with 0.5 µg/ml vitamin B 12 at early-log (1), mid-log (2) and stationary (3) 
phases of growth.    
It can be seen from Figure 4.8 th at the ratio of intensities of sbm to hisG product, 
and hence mRNA levels related to the sbm gene, increases as the growth progresses.

4.2.3 Real time quantification (QPCR) of the genes within the sbm operon  
Absolute quantification of the mRNA levels of the genes corresponding to the sbm 
operon was carried out in order to investig ate the transcriptiona l level control on the 
function of this operon.      Initially, dilutions with known copy numbers (10
5, 104, 103 and 102) of the 
respective RT-PCR products of the four genes ( sbm, argK, ygfG and ygfH) were 
prepared and used for plotting the standard curve (Pffafl, 2004 & Huggett et al ., 
2005). The amplification plot for one of the four genes, sbm, from which the 
standard curve(s) was deri ved, is shown in Figure 4.9.

threshold (bold green line) was set for C t value calculations for the quantitative analyses. And 
inset, the dissociation curve co nfirming the formation of the de sired product in all dilutions. 
The horizontal blue line at the bottom of the dissociation curve corresponds to the negative 
control with the RNA template and hence does not show any product formation. 
Figure 4.9 shows the amplification plot and the dissociation curve (inset, Figure 4.9) 
as observed at the end of the amplification during a real time PCR reaction. It can be 
seen, as expected, that the copy numbers  are inversely proportional to the C t values 
(Gibson et al., 1996). The dissociation cu rve confirmed the forma tion of one specific 
product as all the peaks merged into one at  a specific temperature. The dissociation 
curve for the negative cont rol (reaction with RNA template) was observed as a 
horizontal line at the botto m of the curves (Figure 4.9)  confirming the absence of 
any product formation and hence lack of any gDNA contamination in the sample. 
The dissociation curve analysis  also helped in distinguish ing the primer dimers from 
the individual PCR products (Ririe et al ., 1997). The amplification plots and the 
dissociation curves for the remainder of  the three genes (not shown) of the sbm 
operon were similar to that of the sbm gene (Figure 4.9). The threshold was set 
above the negative control and the C t values were noted for each of the dilutions and 
a standard curve (Figure 4.10) was plotted fo r each of the four genes of the operon. 
The standard curves, used to determin e the mRNA copy numbers corresponding to 
the four genes, had R2 values ranging between 0.98-0.99. Quantification of transcription

corresponding R2 values are as shown on the graph.  
Based on the equations from the respec tive standard curves and using the C t values 
obtained previously from the actual samples, the mRNA copy number of each of the four genes of the sbm operon was calculated. The results obtained have been 
graphically represented in Figures 4 .11, 4.12, 4.13 and 4.14. The calculation of the 
transcript copy numbers of the target genes was based on the following formula

In the case of the sbm gene (Figure 4.11), the corres ponding mRNA levels decrease 
as the culture progresses fr om early-log phase, through to the mid-log phase, into the 
stationary phase, when glucose is used as the sole carbon source. In contrast, the 
mRNA levels corresponding to sbm gene increases as the culture progresses from 
the early-log phase, through to the mid-log phase and finally in to the stationary 
phase, when succinate or propionate is used as the sole carbon source. In the 
stationary phase there is a 2.5 and 3 fold  higher level of mRNA corresponding to the 
sbm gene in cultures with succinate and propionate as  the sole carbon source, 
respectively, as compared to that with glucose as the sole carbon source. This 
observation confirms the role of the sbm gene product in the utilisation of succinate 
and propionate specifically in  the stationary phase of growth. A similar trend was 
observed in the case of the ygfG (Figure 4.12) and argK (Figure 4.14) genes. The 
mRNA levels were 2.0 and 2.2 fold for the ygfG gene and 1.2 and 1.4 fold higher for 
the argK gene, in the presence of succinate a nd propionate, respectiv ely, as the sole 
carbon source, as compared to glucose. Th ese observations confirm the role of the 
ygfG and argK genes in the utilisation of su ccinate and propionate during the 
stationary phase of growth. However,  the mRNA levels corresponding to the ygfH 
gene (Figure 4.13) showed a very different tr end to all the other genes in the operon, 
with a maximum concentration at the begi nning of the growt h, i.e. the early-log 
phase, with a concomitant decrease in the mid-log and stationary phases of the 
culture. In the earl y-log phase there was a 1.2-1.3 fold higher level of mRNA 
corresponding to this gene when succinate  and propionate were used as the sole 
carbon sources, respectively, as compared to that from cells grow n in minimal media 
with glucose as the sole carbon source.  
4.3 Discussion 
4.3.1 Reverse transcription end point PCR Quantification of transcription 
 98The RT-PCR results (Figures 4.6 and 4.8)  showed that the level of the sbm gene 
transcription was greater when E. coli  was grown in succinate as compared to the 
levels of mRNA corresponding to the sbm gene when grown in glucose or 
propionate in the presence of 0.5µg/ml vitamin B 12 in the medium. Further, the 
mRNA formation was observed to increase steadily and reached the highest observed value at the stati onary phase. This confirmed the results obtained during 
the growth analyses (Chapter 2) an d indicated the involvement of the sbm gene in 
succinate utilisation. This also showed that  possibly, one of the levels of control 
related to the sbm gene expression was at the tr anscriptional level, during the 
utilisation of succinate. However, thes e were preliminary experiments with no 
duplicates carried out for verification.   The results of the densitometric analysis from the end point RT-PCR indicated an active role of the sbm gene in the growth of the wild type TR6524 in minimal media 
with succinate as the sole source of carbon. However, th e relatively lower level of 
transcription of the sbm gene, in the presence propionate, as compared to glucose, 
indicated a lack of any role for the  sbm  gene in propionate  utilisation. These 
preliminary studies were obviously not conc lusive and the results did not provide a 
clear understanding of the number of copies of the sbm gene present in the sample. 
Thus, the more accurate QPCR studies were carried out. Primers were designed for the amplification of all the genes within the sbm operon and the RNA from cells 
harvested at the early log, mid log and st ationary phases of growth from all the 
above mentioned conditions were used for the study. 
 
4.3.2 QPCR- absolute quantification of the genes of the sbm operon  
QPCR was carried out with cDNA template  following the revers e transcription of 
RNA isolated from cells harvested at the early-log, mid-log and stationary phases of 
growth of wild type E. coli  TR6524 in minimal media w ith glucose, succinate or 
propionate as the sole source of carbon. Si nce it was an obvious and a confirmed fact 
(Figure 4.5) that there wa s no transcription of the sbm gene in the mutant FA1P1, 
these cells were not used fo r the real time analyses. Se quence specific primers for Quantification of transcription 
 99the individual genes ( sbm, ygfG, ygfH and argK) were designed (Table 9.1) for the 
PCR and the resulting threshold cycle valu es were noted for determining the mRNA 
copy numbers present in the samples. Th e reporter signal was normalised to the 
fluorescence of an internal reference dye  (ROX), to allow for corrections in 
fluorescent fluctuations caused by change s in concentration or volume (Gibson et 
al., 1996 & Bustin, 2002). 
 This study provided us with an unders tanding of the transcription of the 
corresponding genes during the growth of the wild type E. coli  in minimal media 
with glucose, succinate or propionate as the so le source of carbon. An  increase in the 
mRNA levels corresponding to the sbm (2.5 and 3 fold) , ygfG (2.0 and 2.2 fold) , and 
argK (1.2 and 1.4 fold) genes in the stationary phase of growth,  in the presence of 
succinate and propionate as the sole s ource of carbon, respectively, was observed. A 
similar increase was noted for the ygfH (~1.2-1.3 fold) mRNA level in the early-log 
phase of growth in succinate and propi onate as the sole source of carbon. The 
elevated mRNA levels for the 4 genes of the sbm operon (during the different phases 
of growth), in the presence of succinate or propionate as the sole source of carbon as 
compared to when grown in the presence of glucose, indicates  the role of this 
pathway in the utilisation of these substrates.   
 Thus, the stage of growth at which ma ximum mRNA level was observed was found 
to be the stationary phase of growth in three out of  the four genes with the ygfH gene 
being the only exception where maximal mR NA levels were actually found during 
the early-log phase of growth. This ob servation possibly indicates that the ygfH gene 
product, i.e. the propionyl-CoA: succinyl-CoA tran sferase, plays a major role in the 
adaptation of E. coli  to the utilisation of succinate and propionate and is possibly the 
rate limiting step in the pathway proposed by Haller et al., 2000. Hence, it plays a 
major role during the early-log phase of growth of the organism. The three other 
genes of the operon, on the other hand, are transcribed at higher levels during the 
stationary phase possibly due to the effect of the σS transcription factor. The results 
indicate that the genes of the sbm operon are differentially  controlled at the Quantification of transcription 
 100transcriptional level with an increased level of transcription observed for the first 
three genes- sbm, argK and ygfG. ygfH, being the last gene of the operon (Figure 
1.13), was observed to have a higher transcription level during the early stage of 
growth. This result indicated that ygfH might not be a part of the sbm operon and 
might be under the control of a different promoter. Also, the change in the mRNA 
levels corresponding to the argK gene is not as much as seen in the case of the other 
genes. As shown earlier (Figure 1.1 4) the proposed pathway of Haller et al. (2000) 
does not include the produc t of this gene (Haller et al., 2000). This gene product is 
however homologous to the MeaB protein  found in Methylobacter extorquens  AM1, 
known to function as a chaperone protein re quired for the stability of Mea A protein, 
a known mutase involved in the conversion of butyryl CoA to propionyl CoA. Thus 
one can postulate that argK, in addition to its known role in lysi ne-arginine-
ornithine transport (Korot kova and Lidstrom, 2004), is also a chaperone protein 
required for the stability of the Sbm protein. This postulate  is reinforced by the fact 
that the Sbm protein from E. coli , when expressed on its own in E. coli , without a 
histidine tag, was found to be inactive (Dr I. Roy, personal communication). This 
role as a chaperone does not possibly require a marked variation in the mRNA levels 
of this gene.  
 
These results, following the quantification of transcription, for the first time, indicate 
a role of sbm and the related enzymes of the oper on in succinate utilisation, and to a 
lesser extent in propionate utilisation dur ing the stationary phase of growth. The 
results correlate with the data from th e promoter analysis (Chapter 3) which 
indicated that the sbm gene and hence the operon expression is induced as cells enter 
the stationary phase  and under conditions of stress i.e. growth in succinate and 
propionate.

Methylmalonyl -CoA mutase activity in 
E. coli , TR6524  
 HPLC analysis 
 1015.1 Introduction  
Sbm showed a 59% similarity to the stru cturally characterised methylmalonyl-CoA 
mutase from P. shermanii . Despite this high level of sequence identity, it was 
thought that Sbm might not catalyse the MC M reaction since the activity of the 
protein could not be demonstrated (Roy and Leadlay, 1992). Multiple unsuccessful 
attempts were made to establish the act ivity of the over-expressed Sbm protein. 
Another possible reason for th e lack of detectable activit y was thought to be due to 
the higher number of cysteine residues (compared to the mutase from P. shermanii ) 
which might get oxidised under the assay cond itions that were used. Hence, the use 
of higher amounts of reducing agents (such as DTT) in future assay reactions was 
recommended (Dr. I. Roy, PhD thesis). La ter, Haller and co-workers (2000) showed 
that sbm did encode an active MCM when expr essed in the form of a recombinant 
protein with a His-tag (Haller et al ., 2000). It was suggested  that th e activity 
measured was probably due to the presence of the N-terminal His-tag that was used 
to isolate the protein as th ey found that the activity, afte r cleavage of the His-tag, 
dropped to <7% of that measured with the Hi s-tag present. It wa s speculated that the 
N-terminal His-tag used for purification may favour an oligomerisation necessary 
for catalytic act ivity (Haller et al ., 2000). The lack of ac tivity in the previous 
conditions could possibly be due to the inst ability of the non-His  tagged recombinant 
protein. A possible chaperone- like protein required for the stability of the Sbm 
protein in E. coli  would be YgfD (or ArgK), enc oded by the gene downstream of the 
sbm gene. This protein is homologous to the MeaB protein  found in M. extorquens  
AM1, known to function as a chaperone prot ein required for the stability of Mea A 
protein. MeaA is a known mutase involved in the conversion of butyryl CoA to 
propionyl CoA (Korotkova and Lidstrom, 200 4). Thus it can be postulated that 
YgfD (or ArgK), in addition to its known role in lysine-arginine-ornithine transport (Korotkova and Lidstrom, 2004), is a chaperon e protein required for the stability of 
the Sbm protein (discussed in detail in Chapter 4). Hence, in the absence of this chaperone protein, the recombinant Sbm pr otein lost activity during purification. 
This loss of activity was possibly prevented in the case of the His tagged protein due 
to the drastically reduced time required for the purification. Attempts to show the HPLC analysis 
 102MCM activity in wild type E. coli  whole cell extracts ha ve been unsuccessful 
(Vlasie et al., 2002 & Bobik and Rasche, 2003). 
 Previously, several methods have been  described and employed to measure 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity. Thes e include radiometric methods using  
DL[CH
3-14C] methylmalonyl-CoA by paper chro matography (Whitaker and Giorgio, 
1973), spectrophotometric assays involving enzyme coupling to NADH dependent 
dehydrogenases (Watanabe et al ., 1993), a gas chromatographic radiometric assay 
(Goodey & Gompertz, 1972) and a non ra dioactive HPLC assay (Kikuchi et al ., 
1989 & Riedel et al., 1995). The HPLC assay has been found to be simple, sensitive, 
rapid and highly reproducible when compared  with the radiometri c assay as reported 
by a comparative study conducted by Gaire and coworkers (Gaire et al., 1999).  
 The current study attempted the measur ement of MCM activity in whole cell 
extracts from wild type E. coli  in the presence of succinate and propionate as the 
sole carbon source, the conditions thought  to induce Sbm activity. The promoter 
analysis (Chapter 3) showing the presence of a sequence closely similar to the consensus sequence for σS (sigma factor associated with stress relief and stationary 
phase maintenance in E. coli  and other enterobacteria) was found 29 bases up-stream 
of the sbm gene. This supported the findings of the transcription analyses (Chapter 
4) that this gene was possi bly induced and expressed duri ng the stationa ry phase of 
growth. Results from the quantitation of tr anscription (Chapter 4) indicated a strong 
possibility of increasing involvement of the sbm gene, in succinate and propionate 
utilisation, as growth progressed from expone ntial to the stationary phase. Hence, for 
enzyme activity measurement, total protein from cells harvested at the stationary phase was chosen.

from samples following growth at 28oC before induction and incubation at 18oC 
following induction with different IPTG c oncentration as mentioned in the figure 
legend. Control samples (non transformed E. coli  BL21 DE3) and un-induced 
transformed cell samples were also prepar ed and run along side to confirm the over-
expression. The whole cell extract of this E. coli  BL21-DE3 transformed with 
pMEX2 that contains the gene encoding MCM from P. shermanii  (McKie et al ., 
1990) was used in the positive control reaction (Section 9.2.8.6), since the pure form of the enzyme was not commercially available.  
 
5.2.2 HPLC assay of the MCM protein from P. shermanii  
The assay was carried out as describe d in Section 9.2.8.6.2. The positive control 
reaction using the E. coli  BL21-DE3 cell extract helped to standardise assay 
conditions suitable for the test samples. This positive control reaction was carried 
out at two different conditions. One set of  the reaction mixture was incubated at 4oC 
(Haller et al., 2000) and the other at 37oC (Riedel et al., 1995). The reactions were 
stopped at 5, 10, 20 and 40 minute interv als in both cases and the peaks 
corresponding to the disappear ance of the substrate and appearance of the product 
were observed using the HPLC assay.

Figure 5.2: HPLC peak data for over-expressed P. shermanii  MCM. MCM from  P. shermanii  was expressed 
in E. coli  BL21-DE3 and the total protein was used for the reaction which was incubated at 37oC for 5, 10 
and 20min. 5.2 a, b and c show the results of the assay for MCM activity from reaction mixtures incubated 
at 5, 10 and 20min, respectively. The decrease in peak height for MMCoA and the corresponding increase 
for succinyl-CoA can be clearly seen as incubation progresses. HPLC analysis 
 106The results for the positive control as obs erved using HPLC showed that reactions 
incubated at 37oC produced peaks of decreasing intensities for the substrate 
methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA), while the peak  intensities for the product succinyl 
CoA increased (Figures 5.2 a, b, c). This  observation was e xpected in reaction 
mixtures with cell extract that containe d an over-expressed MCM protein. However, 
this was not the case with reac tion mixtures incubated at 4oC. The peak intensities 
were inconsistent and unreliable. Hence reac tions with test samples were carried out 
at 37oC. Since the volume of the extract used in the reactions was kept constant,  the 
amount of protein in the reactions was not the same. However, calculation of 
specific activity normalised this difference.  
5.2.3 HPLC assay of the reaction of the prot ein extract from cells  grown in glucose, 
succinate or propionate 
As described in Section 9.2.8.6.1, solutions of  commercially available lithium salt of 
MMCoA and sodium salt of succinyl-CoA were prepared in order to produce a 
standard calibration curve. The solutions of the standards were manually injected 
into the C-18 column connected to the HP LC detection system and peak areas were 
analysed and used for the calculation of MCM specific activity. The generation of 
MMCoA and succinyl-CoA standard curv es was then followed by HPLC assay 
carried out with reaction mixt ures containing the whole ce ll extract from cells grown 
in minimal media with glucose, succinate or propionate as the sole source of carbon 
and harvested at the stationary phase of growth. Based on the results of the positive 
control mentioned above (5.2.2), the te st reactions were incubated at 37oC and the 
reactions were stopped at 5, 10, 20 and 40 minute inte rvals. The total protein 
extracts from E. coli  cells grown in the presence of glucose, succinate and 
propionate that were used in the reactions were first run through the assay column to 
exclude any peak that could interfere w ith the interpretation of the results. 
 The multiple peaks that were observed in these protein samples appeared within five minutes of sample injection, much ah ead of the peaks co rresponding to MMCoA 
(about 9min) or succinyl-CoA (about 11min). This allowed an easier analysis of the HPLC analysis 
 107peaks that appeared due the action of MCM on MMCoA to form succinyl-CoA. The 
total protein measured, in each case, using the Bradford assay was found be to be 
0.13mg/ml (glucose), 0.14mg/ml (succi nate) and 1.29mg/ml (propionate).  
 The peak data obtained from the HPLC assa y for reactions with protein extract from 
cells grown in minimal media with glucos e, succinate or propionate as the sole 
source of carbon (5min incubation) and the relevant negative cont rol reactions with 
only the protein sample are shown in  Figures 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5, respectively.

the differences introduced as a result of manual injection. The in cubation time of up

propionate or succinate as  the sole source of carbon was measured based on the 
disappearance of the MMCoA substrate duri ng the course of the 40min incubation 
and the values were tabulated as shown in Table 5.1. The specific activity of MCM 
obtained is also graphically represented in Figure 5.6. As the incubation time for the 
reactions was increased, the activity was ob served to decrease rather than an 
expected increase, in all cases. The only exception was the 10 minute reaction with total protein from cells grown in glucose that showed an increase as compared to the 5min reaction (Table 5.1).

The MCM specific activity observed for th e reaction stopped at the end of 5min 
incubation (Table 5.1) was found to be 1.37x10-3 U/mg in the cells grown in minimal 
media with glucose as the sole source of car bon. In contrast, it was found to be four 
times higher (4.76x10-3 U/mg) in the whole cell extract of cells grown in minimal 
media with succinate and two times higher (2.79x10-3 U/mg) in the whole cell 
extract of cells grown in minimal media with  propionate as the sole source of 
carbon.  
 This is the first ever report of the dete ction of MCM activity  in the whole cell 
extracts of wild type E. coli . The presence of higher MCM activity in the presence of 
succinate and propionate as compared to the activity observed in the presence of 
glucose strongly indicates the role of th e enzyme in the utilisation of these carbon 
sources in the stationary phase. This is th e first time such a direct correlation has 
been made between MCM activity and the util isation of substrates such as succinate 0123456

5.3 Discussion 
Previous studies (Haller et al ., 2000 & Bobik & Rasche, 2003) have assayed the 
activity of the purified recombinant Sbm protein. This is the first report of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity in wild type E. coli . Higher specific activities 
were found in the presence of succinate and propionate, as compar ed to the specific 
activity observed in the presence of glucose. Sp ecific activities of 4.76x10
-3 U/mg 
and 2.79x10-3 U/mg were measured in cells from succinate and propionate, 
respectively, compared to 1.37x10-3 U/mg that was observed with cells from glucose 
(Table 5.1). This strongly indicates the role of the enzyme in the utilisation of these 
carbon sources in the stationary phase.  Riedel (1995) studied the stability of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in crude cell 
(human fibroblasts, human glioma and rat liver) homogenates and found that the 
enzyme activity declined  at a rate of 0.08 h
-1 (Reidel et al.,1995). Bobik and Rasche 
(2003) used E. coli extracts in unsuccessful  attempts in their study and suggested 
that partial purification of the enzymes as recombinant proteins with affinity tags 
was required to de monstrate activity in-vitro  (Bobik and Rasche, 2003). The His tag 
used in the purification of recombinant Sbm was thought to be required for the 
catalytic activity of the enzyme in-vitro  (Haller et al., 2000). The current study did 
not involve the use of any stabilising agents (Reidel et al.,  1995) and did not employ 
recombinant or purification methods using affinity tags. The decreasing activity of 
MCM (Table 5.1) with increasing incubation time could be due to the absence of a 
suitable stabilising agent (such as glycerol) that maintains the enzyme intact (Riedel 
et al., 1995).  
 The specific activity of MCM from total cell extract for wild type E. coli  grown in 
minimal media with glucose, succinate or pr opionate as the sole  carbon source is as 
shown in Table 5.1. The decrease in specif ic activity of the mutase, with the HPLC analysis 
 113exception of that observed for glucose (10m in), with an increase in the incubation 
time (Figure 5.6) indicates the need for s horter incubation times for the reaction to 
obtain kinetic parameters. In fact, the spec ific activity, in the case of succinate and 
propionate, was observed to decrease by almo st half as the r eaction incubation time 
doubled (Table 5.1). This trend was observe d for glucose grown cells for the 20min 
and 40min incubation periods.    The specific activity measured in this wo rk is relatively low compared to the 
mammalian MCM activity of 0.39 U/g (Riedel et al., 1995) and 26.4 U/mg (Carlucci 
et al., 2007). Both these activities were measured in crude protein extract from rat 
liver cells, indicating the occurrence of a high concentration of MCM for 
metabolism of propionate, proving the evol utionary importance of methylmalonyl-
CoA mutase in mammals. Also, in this wo rk, the peak data (Figure 5.2) suggested 
that the specific activity of P. shermanii  MCM was higher as the P. shermanii  MCM 
was over expressed using a strong promoter in E. coli, hence  more active enzyme 
would be present. E. coli  would be expected to produ ce MCM at a relatively lower 
concentration when grown in the presence of vitamin B
12 and the appropriate carbon 
source such as succinate or propionate. This would explain the relatively low 
specific activity observed in the wild type E. coli  extract. 
 In conclusion thus, this work resulted in the first successful measurement of MCM activity in wild type E. coli . MCM specific activity analysis revealed a four fold 
increase of the specific activ ity in the case of growth in succinate compared to that 
observed with growth in glucose and two fo ld increase in the case of growth in 
propionate. These results indicate a direct  involvement of MCM in succinate and 
propionate utilisation, in the stationary phase of growt h. The specific activity data 
confirm the findings of the growth and tr anscription analyses (Chapters 2 and 4) 
where the sbm gene encoding MCM was thought to be of importance in succinate 
and propionate uptake and util isation. The transcription quantitation data showed 
that the sbm gene transcript copy number was hi gher in the cells grown in succinate 
compared to that seen in the case of cel ls from propionate or glucose and the MCM HPLC analysis 
 114specific activity measured using the HPLC  analysis reconfirm these findings. The 
results from the HPLC analysis also verify the possibility of sbm gene expression in 
the stationary phase of growth as the total protein used in the reactions for the assay were obtained from E. coli  TR6524 cells harvested at the early stationary phase of 
growth thus correlating well with the data from the promoter analysis which suggested that sbm could be one of the genes under σS regulation.

 Proteomics 
 1156.1 Introduction 
Proteomic approaches have been employed in the systematic identification and 
characterisation of proteins (Gerber et al.,  2003 & Vollmer et al ., 2003). The 
complexity of the proteome and the inabil ity to amplify protei ns, unlike the nucleic 
acids, has led to the development of this technique that enables the characterisation 
of proteins in microgram quantities (Minden, 2007).  The proteome is a highly dynamic system  where synthesis, degradation, and 
modification of proteins are subject to  change in response to internal and external 
stimuli (Vollmer et al., 2003).  Proteomic studies have helped elucidate the complex 
cellular responses of bacteria such as E. coli  (which has been frequently adopted as a 
model organism for structural an d functional studies). For example,  two dimensional 
electrophoresis (2DE) has been used to id entify the channel-forming transmembrane 
proteins responsible for the passage of  phosphate (PhoE), maltose; maltodextrins 
(LamB) and nucleosides  (Tsx). In addition,  high affinity receptors for the transport 
of ferric iron (FepA, FhuA), vitamin B
12 (BtuB), and fatty acids (FadL) have also 
been elucidated using 2DE in E. coli  (Molloy et al., 2000).  
 
2DE is a high resolution technique for pr otein separation and identification. It 
comprises the fractionation of complex protei n mixtures according to their charge in 
the first dimension (iso-electric focusing, IE F) and to the independent parameter of 
molecular mass in the second dimension. The reproducibility of 2DE is highly 
dependent on the precision of the focusi ng in the first dimension (Westermeier et al., 
1983). The use of immobilised pH gradient (IPG) strips has made IEF more consistent; allowing easier comparison among  different gel samples (Lee and Lee, 
2003) and ensures highly reproducib le pH gradients which show  less sensitivity to 
sample components. The stability of th e IPG strips permit focusing times of 
sufficient duration for polypeptides to attain  their isoelectric poi nt thus improving 
focusing reproducibility and simplifyi ng spot identification (Bjellqvist et al., 1993). 
  Proteomics 
 116Oh (2002) carried out a global gene expression analysis of E. coli grown on acetate 
and used growth on glucose as a refere nce. The study not onl y identified genes 
(glyoxylate, TCA cycle and gluconeogenic)  known to be asso ciated with the 
metabolic pathways associated with acetate utilisation but also genes that had not 
been linked previously (such as malic enzymes and PEP synthase) with the metabolic pathway under study. Peng and Shimizu (2003) observed the global E. 
coli responses to growth under different car bon sources (gluconate, glycerol and 
acetate) and showed that  glycolytic enzymes were up-regulated in E. coli during 
growth on all these carbon sources and that the flux in the gluconeogenic direction is 
smaller than the glycolytic flux when acetate was metabolised.  In addition, up-
regulation of TCA cycle enzymes was observed in all growth conditions (Peng and Shimizu, 2003). A proteomic approach (usi ng nano-LC/MS) was used to investigate 
the gene expression of E. coli  in lactose and glucose as sole sources of carbon. This 
revealed that, although the glycolysis a nd TCA cycle genes were common for the 
metabolism of both the sugars, proteins c oded by genes specific for lactose transport 
and metabolism were identified only from cells harvested from media containing 
lactose (Vollmer et al., 2003). 
 
A more recent LC/MS study by Silva et al ., 2006 aimed to quantify the E. coli  
proteome when the bacteria were cultured in glucose, lactose or acetate. A slower growth observed in acetate was attributed to reduced protein synthesis as evident 
from the down regulation of ribosomal protei ns and associated chaperonins (such as 
GroEL). The gene expression pattern for cells grown in lactose and glucose was 
similar to that observe d by Vollmer (2003) (Silva et al., 2006). Raman et al. (2005) 
evaluated the differences in the response of E. coli  W3110 to glucose limitation 
under fed-batch and exponential culture conditions,  using proteomic analysis .  
Proteins involved in high affinity glucos e uptake, the transpor tation and degradation 
of alternate carbon sources and TCA cycle were observed to be up-regulated under 
fed-batch conditions indicating the organi sm’s ability to transport and utilise 
alternate carbon sources as glucose was depleted. Ribonucle otide synthesis proteins 
and ribosomal recycling factor s were some of the proteins that were found to be up-Proteomics 
 117regulated in continuous culture, thus, equipping the organism with increased 
nucleotide and protein biosynthesis requi red for the exponential growth (Raman et 
al., 2005). A recent study by Han et al . (2007) revealed 52 significantly altered 
proteins in E. coli grown with long chain fatty acid, ol eic acid, as the sole source of 
carbon compared to growth on glucose. The authors noted increased levels of long 
chain fatty acid degradation proteins, FadA  and FadB, proteins involved in fatty acid 
transport (FadL), glyoxylate shunt (AceA ) and TCA cycle (Mdh, SdhA, SucC and 
SucD) among others (Han et al., 2007).  
 2D gel electrophoresis carried  out by Brock (2002) to mo nitor differences in the 
protein pattern of E. coli  W3350 cells grown on acetate or propionate showed that 
proteins (except propionyl CoA synthetase, PrpE) encoded by the prp operon were 
exclusively produced during growth on propionate along with high amounts of 
acetyl CoA synthase ( acs). The analysis also reported increased levels of malate 
synthase ( aceB) during growth on propi onate. Reduced amounts of 
phosphoglycerate mutase-I ( gpmA), propanol-preferring alcohol dehydrogenase 
(adhP), and pyruvate kinase ( pykF) were observed in propionate-grown cells 
compared with cultures grown in the pres ence of acetate. The authors aimed at a 
better understanding of propiona te oxidation and it is import ant to note that their 
media did not incorporate any source of vitamin B12 and hence, would not have 
allowed the expression of active Sbm (Brock et al., 2002).  
 This study sought to eval uate changes in the E. coli  proteome when the cells were  
cultured in minimal media with glucose, su ccinate or propionate as the sole source 
of carbon. Such an analysis would reveal th e change in protein expression under 
these conditions of growth. However, in  this study only a few protein spots from 
different areas of the gels from all c onditions were analysed due to financial 
constraints.  
 
  Proteomics 
 1186.2 Results  
The promoter analysis (Chapter 3) indicated  that the onset of stationary phase was 
one possible condition when the sbm gene containing operon might be induced. 
Further, the QPCR data (Chapter 4) s upported this hypothesis. An increased mRNA 
transcript copy number was observed in ce lls harvested at th e beginning of the 
stationary phase when E. coli  was grown in the presence of succinate and propionate 
as the sole carbon source. He nce, whole cell extracts from cells harvested at the 
beginning of the stationary phase was us ed for the proteomic analysis. The amount 
of protein loaded onto the 2DE gel  was controlled to ensure that an equal amount of 
protein from each condition was applied onto the IPG strip. This study used the 
Progenesis Same Spots software (Non-Line ar Dynamics, UK) to match and compare 
2DE separations of proteins from E. coli  TR6524 grown in glucose, succinate or 
propionate as the sole carbon source. In this approach,  an average of 980 protein 
spots across all the conditions was iden tified using the software. Based on the 
estimations of Raman and co-workers (2005)  this number of spots would represent 
about 25% of the entire E. coli  proteome (Raman et al., 2005). Owing to the cost of 
spot identification and analys es only twenty six spots we re chosen for analysis in 
total from the three different growth condi tions. As the spots were hand picked, it 
was important they were reasonably separa ted and well stained to minimise errors.  
 The results of 2DE analysis of the E. coli extracts  are as shown in Figure 6.1

analysis from succinate and propionate, only three other spots (apart from the 
landmark proteins), from various parts of  the glucose gel were analysed. Four 
protein spots with Mw and pI values similar to Sbm were analysed from succinate 
grown cells while no such clear spots coul d be found in the same region of the gel 
with sample from propionate grown cells. The remaining spots that were analysed 
were picked from different pa rts of the gels, as shown in Figure 6.1, in an attempt to

succinate or propionate. The identified proteins, the genes that code for them and the

which they were expressed are as shown in Figure 6.2. Mascot is a peptide identification search engine which uses a

 123Of the 26 protein spots that were picked  for identification 20 spots returned a 
positive match with known proteins and good confidence interval (CI) scores (95-100%). The remaining 6 protein spots were identified as hypotheti cal proteins with 
poor CI scores (zero) and hence have not been reported here. The proteins identified 
in the current study had a sequence covera ge (fraction of the complete protein 
sequence analysed)
 that ranged from 2-54% and these identified proteins represent a 
small fraction of the overall protein spots that were observed. Among these, proteins 
responsible for the transpor t (DppA, HisJ, GltI) of pep tides and amino acids and 
proteins that function in energy meta bolism (AceF, GabD, GapA) including GpmM 
involved in carbohydrate  catabolism were identified (Table 6.1). In addition, the 
elongation factor, Tsf,  invol ved in protein translation and the chaperonin, GroEL, 
(generated under stress conditions) that pr events protein misf olding and promotes 
the refolding and proper assembly of unfo lded polypeptides were also identified 
(Han & Lee, 2006). The dipeptide transpor t protein, DppA (Figure 6.3b) and the 
GroEL chaperonin protein (Fi gure 6.3a) were identified in all the three growth 
conditions. GapA (glyceralsehyde-3-phospha te dehydrogenase) was common to gels 
with samples of E. coli  whole cell extracts grown with  succinate and propionate as 
the sole carbon source. AspC, aspartate am inotransferase (amino acid biosynthesis) 
and Tsf were found to be the common proteins found in E. coli  whole cell extracts 
grown with glucose and succinate as  the sole carbon source (Figure 6.2).  
 
The ‘mountain’ plots for three of the protei ns that showed differential levels when 
the E. coli  was grown in glucose, succinate or propionate are shown in Figures 6.3 a-

samples from E. coli  TR6524 growth on succinate. AceF and GabD (Table 6.1) were 
also observed in the samples from succina te grown cells. CpdB, AceF and GabD 
were among the protein spot s that had pI values and Mws similar to that of Sbm. 
AspC was observed in whole cell extracts grown in glucose and succinate as shown 
in Figure 6.2. GpmM (involved in carbohydr ate catabolism) was found in cells 
grown in minimal media with propion ate as the sole source of carbon.  
 
6.3 Discussion 
All organisms respond to environmental vari ations such as nut rient availability, 
stress or oxygen limitation. Physiol ogical changes are accompanied by 
corresponding alterations in gene and protein expression  and a better understanding 
of these changes in cells is  of fundamental importance. 
 This proteomic study has been carried out with wild type E. coli  TR6524 cells  to 
understand the protein expression pattern when  the strain is grown in minimal media 
with succinate or propionate as the sole  source of carbon. A colour coded summary 
of the proteins identified in th is study is shown in Figure 6.2. 
 
Figure 6.4 shows the proteins that were expressed under the specific growth 
conditions. Growth of E. coli  in the minimal media with  glucose, succinate or 
propionate obviously involves the induction of a multitude of pathways and this 
preliminary proteomic study has been able to identify a few important proteins that are an integral part to these pathways.         Proteomics

The ABC dipeptide transporter protein (DppA ) is a dipeptide-bi nding protein of a 
transport system that is required for peptid e chemotaxis and increases in response to 
the physiological short-term adaptation to glucose limitati on. DppA is a periplasmic 
binding protein of the ABC transporters i nvolved in the carbohydrate and amino acid 
uptake that is important during gluc ose limitation (Han & Lee, 2006). The 
chaperonin protein (GroEL) occurs in a ll growth conditions along with DppA. The Glucose

 129‘mountain’ plots for both thes e proteins (Figures 6.3a an d 6.3b) showed higher peak 
intensity in succinate and glucose grown cells than that observed in propionate 
grown cells. The higher peak intensity (an indicator of the amount of the protein 
produced) for DppA in gels representing growth on succinate suggests the need for enhanced transport of nutrients to facilitate the growth of E. coli  TR6524 in the 
presence of difficult carbon sources (in mini mal media with succinate and also be 
the case for propionate). E. coli  is known to release cell wall murein peptides into 
the culture medium during exponential growth (Goodell an d Schwartz, 1985). Also, 
it is known that cells at th e stationary phase degrad e membrane phospholipids, 
transport and utilise the derived fatty acids as a source of nutrition and energy 
(DiRusso and Nystrom, 1998). Thus, the up -regulated peptide transport protein, 
DppA, may play a role in recycling th ese excreted peptides, and possibly in 
utilisation of peptides from lysed cells , under the nutrient limited conditions 
experienced in exponential conditions.  
 The GroEL chaperonin protein is  involved in protein folding and post translational 
modifications and is thus required for the synthesis of complete functional proteins. 
The presence of this protein in all thr ee growth conditions (minimal media with 
glucose, succinate or propi onate) shows the general rele vance of this protein under 
any condition of growth.  Chaperones such as GroEL occur at different locations on 
2DE gels indicating multiple forms of their existence within the E. coli  cell (Han & 
Lee, 2006). GroEL expression on the gel with samples from propionate could 
correspond to a form of the protein that is  less abundant compared to those observed 
in succinate or glucose. Studies concerned with  the 2DE protein map of E. coli  under 
glucose excess (Wick et al ., 2001) and glucose limited (Ferenci, 1999; Peng and 
Shimizu, 2003 & Raman et al ., 2005) conditions and the E. coli  proteome under 
these conditions have been extensively an alysed. Reports have also been published 
on fed batch and continuous cultures (Raman et al., 2005 & Franchini et al., 2006) 
of E. coli  grown in the pres ence of glucose. Silva and co-workers (2006) reported a  
lower growth rate when E. coli  was grown on acetate and correlated this slow 
growth to a lower rate of protein synthesis and decreased  levels of ribosomal Proteomics 
 130proteins and associated chaperones. Am ong many other proteins, GroEL (encoded 
by groL) was observed to be up-regulated in gl ucose. The authors concluded that the 
increased protein production was due to higher growth rate supported by glucose 
providing the need for these chaperones to facilitate protein folding and post-translational modification. Growth on acetat e, unlike glucose, required the cell to 
redirect the carbon flux through different metabolic pathways to sustain growth (Oh 
et al ., 2002 & Silva et al., 2006). This observation is cons istent with that of ours 
(Figure 6.3a) where the mountai n plots reveal higher peak s for GroEL in succinate 
and glucose and a relatively low peak in propionate. Howe and Hershey (1983) 
showed that initiation factors, elongati on factors, and ribosomes are regulated 
coordinately with growth rate of cells, using various media (Howe and Hershey, 
1983) which correlates well with th e findings of the present study. 
 CpdB, as mentioned earlier, is responsible for catalysing the  conversion of 2,3- 
cyclic nucleotide to nucleic acid and phosphate via 3-nucleotide  (Han & Lee, 2006) 
thus being a part of the nucleotide and nuc leoside salvage pathwa ys and plays a role 
in the recovery of these compounds to compensate for the nutrient limiting conditions in the stationary phase.  
 
Two protein spots from growth on succina te were identified as the glutamate/ 
aspartate transporter su bunit (GltI). GltI is a transpor ter protein that is involved in 
the transport of glutamate and aspartate under nutrient limiting conditions. This indicates that in the stationary phase th e cells are recruiting other carbon sources 
such as peptides and amino acids for their survival.  Two spots from growth on propionate we re identified as phosphoglycerate mutase 
(GpmM). Phosphoglycerate mutase is an en zyme involved in gl ycolysis and hence 
in energy production. The identification of the same protein as two different spots is 
not uncommon. A similar observation re ported by Lee and Lee (2003) showed 
seventeen E. coli  proteins including Tsf, Dn aK and GapA to appear as  multiple spots Proteomics 
 131in the 2DE system. They attributed the finding to isoforms or post translational 
modifications in the case of DnaK and pr otein degradation in the case of Tsf.  
The physiological adaptation of E. coli  during carbon limited growth is characterised 
primarily by an over expression of high-a ffinity transporter genes. Generally, an 
increased expression of alternative car bon/ energy and nitrogen source transport 
systems and increased expression of com ponents of stress response regulons are 
observed under such conditions of growth. Studies of glucose limitation (which is 
analogous to conditions with only succinate  or propionate as carbon sources) with  
E. coli  also showed that TCA cycle enzymes were repressed, while enzymes 
involved in acetate and formate produc tion and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas 
pathways were induced. More recent studies have indicated that, in addition to the 
central metabolism proteins, periplasmic binding proteins invol ved in uptake of 
carbohydrates and amino acids are also upreg ulated with glucose limitation (Wick et 
al., 2001). Among them many genes encoding substrate-binding proteins and 
transport proteins for sugars were detect ed at increased expression levels. Amino 
acid transporters such as those for histid ine (HisP), glutamate/aspartate (GltL) were 
also highly upregulated. Wick and co-wor kers (2001) and Fischer and Sauer (2003), 
from their proteome and carbon flux study, respectively, indicated the presence of 
the PEP glyoxylate cycle that increases gr owth efficiency under glucose-limited 
conditions (Wick et al ., 2001 & Fischer and Sauer, 2003). The PEP-glyoxylate 
cycle, which is a part of the anapleuro tic shunt, is known to work only in the 
presence of acetate or fatty acids (succinate  or propionate in this study) and confer 
more metabolic flexibility to the cells by synthesing or upregul ating the necessary 
proteins thus allowing the cells to cope  with the growth conditions (Cronan and 
Laporte, 1996; Raman et al., 2005 & Franchini et al., 2006). The induction of HisJ 
and GltI (Table 6.1 and Figure 6.4) involved in transport and uptake of amino acids 
and identification of proteins involve d in carbohydrate metabolism (such as gapA 
and pck) in this study adds to and confirms these findings. 
 Succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, encoded by gabD located at 60.14 min on 
the E. coli  chromosome is a part of the gabDTPC operon involved in the catabolism Proteomics 
 132of gamma aminobutyric acid (GAB A) and arginine (Bartsch et al., 1990 & Fuhrer et 
al., 2007). AceF (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransf erase) is a part of the multienzyme 
complex involved in the conversion of pyr uvate to acetyl CoA and carbon dioxide 
following glycolysis and is reported to in crease during aerobic growth (Han & Lee, 
2006). The increased incidence of amino acid transport proteins (DppA) and proteins 
involved in amino acid metabolism ( gabD) shows the interaction between multiple 
pathways to help E. coli  cope with difficult growth conditions.  
 In conclusion, this proteomic approach was adopted to understand the global protein 
expression pattern when wild type E. coli  is grown in minimal media with succinate 
or propionate as the sole source of car bon. As observed these growth conditions 
have induced the expression of transporte r proteins and energy generating proteins 
(Table 6.1) required by E. coli  to cope with the growth conditions. Also, 
interestingly there is a noted rise in the expression of amino acid transporters specifically and the sbm operon comprises a membrane  ATPase protein (ArgK) 
required for the active incorporation
 of arginine, ornithine, and lysine into cells. 
Although a transporter, argK, is not an ABC transporter possibly owing to the 
restrictions imposed by its ATPase nature (Celis et al ., 1998). Having a transport 
protein within the operon lead s to the possible speculation th at Sbm could be part of 
a pathway that gets switched on under st ressful growth conditions allowing lysine 
and arginine to be transported within the cell to support the growth of the bacteria. 
Sbm possibly allows metabolism of propionate or succinate as examples of stressful 
growth conditions. Hence, this operon might be a stress induced operon with 
multiple roles. Previously, we have also discussed the possibility of ArgK being a 
chaperone for Sbm (Chapter 4).   However, the lack of detect ion of Sbm under the current test conditions could be 
attributed to the facts, that only a few spot s were analysed and the low sensitivity of 
gel based assays with coomassie blue based detection methods. In addition, 2D 
PAGE has been reported to be quite insens itive to proteins th at are not soluble 
during the isoelectric focusing stage of the separation (Silva et al., 2006). The Sbm Proteomics 
 133protein might have been pr odued in very low amounts and hence, was not detected 
under the experimental conditions that were used. Examination of codon bias values 
(which is a measure of abundance of protei ns) detected in 2D gels, has shown that 
Sbm is a low abundance protein. He nce, pre-gel enrichment (Gygi et al ., 2000) 
would possibly be required in order to detect Sbm.  
 Although the results presented he re are preliminary and in their early stages, it is 
important to note that the da ta obtained from the protein spot analysis fit in quite 
well with previous research. The information obtained provides a better understanding of how the E. coli  is able to adapt its metabolism to environmental 
alterations. These results are encouraging and with the  appropriate experimental 
design and large-scale analysis offered by pr oteomics this could provide the basis for 
further investigations into the complex biol ogical networks that are altered when an 
organism adapts to changes in environmental conditions.

 Metabolic engineering of B. cereus SPV  
 1347.1 Introduction 
The composition of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) is governed by the bacterial 
strain used and the carbon source utili sed to grow the bacteria (Valappil et al., 2007a 
& Valappil et al ., 2007b). Currently, Gram-negative bacteria such as Cupriavidus  
(previously  Wautersia ) necator, Methylobacteri um organophillum, Pseudomonas 
oleovorans and recombinant  E. coli  are employed in the production of PHAs on an 
industrial scale. However, PHAs isolated from Gram-negative organisms contain the 
pyrogenic outer membrane lipopolysacchar ide (LPS) endotoxins, which are known 
to co-purify with the PHAs. The pres ence of LPS induces a strong immunogenic 
reaction and is therefore undesirable for th e biomedical application of the PHAs 
(Chen and Wu, 2005). The absence of LPS in  Gram-positive bacteria has made them 
potentially a better source of PHAs that can  be used for biomedic al applications (Lee 
et al., 1999).  
 
In addition to being Gram positive, the genus Bacillus  has been recognised as a 
potential host for gene expression due to  the availability of  a great deal of 
information on its transcript ional and translational re gulation. Moreover, members 
of the genus can be easily grown to very high cell dens ity using inexpensive carbon 
and nitrogen sources. These factors have ma de the idea of metabolic engineering of 
PHA biosynthetic pathways in Bacillus  an attractive proposition (Law et al., 2003 & 
Valappil et al., 2007a). Hori (2002) described the construction of a self-disruptive B. 
megaterium  strain that lyses as a response to  substrate exhaustion during P(3HB) 
production (Hori et al ., 2002) and similarly Law (2003) and Wang (2006) used 
recombinant B. subtilis  to clone and express pha genes from B. megaterium  (Law et 
al., 2003) and to produce mcl-PHA (Wang et al ., 2006), respectively. The results 
from these studies have identified th e importance of members of the genus Bacillus  
in PHA production.  
 
This study aimed at the modificat ion of the PHA producing strain Bacillus cereus  
SPV (Valappil et al., 2007b) by incorporating the MCM encoding sbm gene from E. 
coli K12 into B. cereus  SPV. This modified B. cereus  strain would then be able to Metabolic engineering of B. cereus SPV  
 135use the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway fo r the production of the commercially 
important polymer, polyhydroxybutyrate-co- hydroxyvalerate [P(3HB-co-3HV)] as 
shown in Figure 7.1 from structurally unr elated and relatively cheap carbon source 
such as glucose, rather than the routinely used propionate.  
              
 
     
Figure 7.1: PHB-co-HV biosynthesis using MCM pathway. A schematic representation of the 
reactions that would be involved in P(3HB-co-3HV) production using the MCM pathway.  
MCM shown in green box shows the incorporation of the sbm gene (carried out in the current 
study) and the transcarboxylase and epimera se shown in the red boxes indicate the 
identification of the existing sequences within the B. cereus  genome. 
 
Valappil et al. (2007a) indicated the presence of a methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase in

number NP_978861 assigned to B. cereus ATCC 10987), involved in the 
decarboxylation of (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to  propionyl-CoA, was also identified.  
 This chapter describe s the cloning of the sbm gene in an attempt towards the 
metabolic engineering of B. cereus  SPV in order to study, in the future, the effect of 
MCM in the accumulation of P(3HB-co-3 HV) from non related simple carbon 
sources such as glucose.  However, the uptake of vitamin B
12 is essential for the 
functioning of coenzyme B 12-dependent MCM, since  B. cereus  SPV is not known to 
synthesise endogenous vitamin B 12. Thus the B. cereus  genome was also searched 
for genes which would allow vitamin B 12 uptake. A putative cob(I)alamin adenosyl 
transferase (Genbank acce ssion number NP_977924) was identified  in the in           
B. cereus  10987 sequence with a 64% sequence identity to a hypothetical protein, 
encoded by the gene yvqK, considered to catalyse coenzyme transport and 
processing in B. subtilis .  
 Thus it was thought that the clon ing of the sbm gene would allow B. cereus  SPV to 
produce P(3HB-co-3HV) using the pathway shown in Figure 7.1.

 1377.2 Results 
7.2.1 Cloning of the sbm gene into pHCHM05, a Bacillus  expression vector  
The first step in the process was the cloning of the sbm gene into a vector compatible 
with B. cereus  SPV. This involved the isolation of  pEX3, a construct containing the 
sbm gene (Figure 7.2a) cloned into pT7-18 c onstructed previously (Dr. Ipsita Roy, 
unpublished data). This was followed by the PCR amplification of the sbm gene 
(Figure 7.2b) using suitably de signed primers (Table 9.1) with recognition sites for 
the restriction endonucleases Xba1 and Xma1 required for cloning into pHCHM05 
(Figure 9.1).

7.2.2 Transformation of B. cereus SPV  
The electroporation method (Xue et al ., 1999) used for the transformation of  
B. subtilis 1604 was found to be unsuitable for the transformation of  
B. cereus  SPV and protocols that were specific ally developed for the transformation 
of B. cereus  using electroporation ((Belliveau and Trevors, 1999 & Turgeon et al., 
2006) were tried unsuccessfully. Th e challenge of transforming  
B. cereus  SPV with the pHCM05 sbm construct was finally overcome with a 
protoplast preparation and a polyethylen e glycol (PEG) induced transformation 
protocol developed for Bacillus licheniformis  (Pragai et al., 1994).

 141Growth of colonies of possi ble recombinant strains of B. cereus  SPV harbouring the 
pHCMC05 sbm construct were observed on ART media plates (Pragai et al., 1994) 
two days after the transfor mation. Unlike the results obser ved for the insert release 
for B. subtilis  and E. coli  DH5α (Figures 7.4a and 7.4b), the restriction of the 
pHCMC05 sbm isolated from B. cereus  SPV did not result in the release of the sbm 
insert. This was possibly due to the inabil ity of the restricti on endonucleases to 
digest the DNA as B. cereus  is known to protect it s DNA by methylation. Site-
specific DNA methylation interferes with sequence specific DNA binding proteins 
such as restriction e ndonucleases (Nelson and McClelland, 1991 & Roberts et al ., 
2007). B. subtilis 1604 used previously in this st udy, on the other hand, is not known 
to have any modification on its DNA (Dr.  Mark Clements, personal communication) 
thus allowing the restriction digest to proceed as normal.  
 Finally, a PCR protocol, where the plas mid DNA isolated from the regenerated 
Bacillus cereus SPV protoplasts was used as the template to amplify the sbm gene 
using specific primers. The results are shown in Figure 7.6.

7.3 Discussion 
P(3HB- co-3HV) is a biodegradable PHA thermopl astic that has more flexibility and 
reduced strength making it easier to pr ocess this co -polymer than P(3HB). 
Production of P(3HB- co-3HV) has been dependent on the use of many exogenous 
and endogenous propionigenic substrates such  as propionic acid which has been the 
most widely used ‘precursor substrate’ for P(3HB- co-3HV) biosynthesis. P(3HB) 
homopolymers can be produced  from a single carbon substr ate such as glucose, 
however, a co-substrate such as propionate or valerate (precu rsors of 3HV) is 
required for the production of copol ymers such as P(3HB-co-3HV).  
 Host cell genome manipulation has been demonstrated to eliminate competing 
pathways or modify native regulation for improved function of desirable pathways 
(Aldor and Keasling, 2003). The significan t achievements and breakthroughs made 
for novel processes for biotechnological pr oduction of PHAs have shown that any 
production system will most probably rely on genetically engineered organisms and 
bacteria have been the best and almost only source for PHAs owing to their high 
density cultivation and relatively easier r ecovery of the resulting polymer. An 
efficient production of P(3HB-co-3HV) by fed-batch culture of a recombinant E. 
coli XL1-Blue harbouring a plasmid containing the Alcaligenes latus  PHA 
biosynthesis genes, in minimal media us ing glucose and propionic acid as co-
substrates was reported recently (Choi and Lee, 2000). However, propionic acid is 
more expensive than simple carbon sources such as glucose and thus significantly 
affects the cost of produc tion.  In addition, propionic ac id is also a highly toxic 
compound, making the growth of the bacter ia quite difficult (Steinbuchel & Lutke-
Eversloh, 2003).  
 Metabolic engineering of B. cereus SPV  
 143The alternative solution to reduce this e xpense would be to use organisms that are 
able to use structurally unrelated carbon sources. The only wild-type bacteria, which 
naturally synthesise P(3HB-co-3HV) with  very high contents of 3HV (>75mol%) 
from unrelated carbon sources like gluc ose are species belonging to the genus 
Nocardia or Rhodococcus. These bacteria degrade glucose to pyruvate which is then 
carboxylated to oxaloacetate and subsequent ly converted to su ccinyl-CoA by reverse 
reactions of the TCA cycle. Succinyl-CoA is then conve rted to methylmalonyl-CoA 
using methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is  then decarboxylated to propionyl-CoA. 
Thus there is endogenous generation of the propionyl-C oA from simple carbon 
sources (Steinbuchel & Lutke-Eversloh, 2003). Th is propionyl-CoA is  then used as a 
precursor for the 3HV monomer in P(3H B-co-3HV) biosynthesis. The pathway 
described above is schematically repres ented in Figure 7.1. However, large scale 
production of the copolymer using these na tural producers has been difficult owing 
to the growth and recovery processe s (Steinbuchel & Lutke-Eversloh, 2003). 
 The other approach to the economical pr oduction of P(3HB-co-3 HV) is the use of 
metabolic engineering. For example, the introduction of the methylmalonyl-CoA 
pathway into other organisms can lead to the introduction of an endogenous source 
of propionyl-CoA.  In this work, cloning of the sbm gene into B. cereus  is the first 
step towards such metabolic engineering.  A similar strategy was involved in a study 
describing the construction of a recombinant Salmonella enterica  Serovar 
typhimurium  for the production of P(3HB- co-3HV). The genes for (2R)-
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase ( sbm) and a (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase 
(ygfG ) from E. coli  were cloned into S. enterica Serovar typhimurium , thus enabling 
the conversion of succinyl-CoA to pr opionyl-CoA. In addition, the PHA 
biosynthesis operon of Actinobacter was inserted into the gene encoding 2-
methylcitrate synthase (involved in propiona te uptake) of this bacterium, thereby 
establishing PHA biosynthesis via the MCM pathway and disrupting propionate 
utilisation. This recombinant Salmonella sp. synthesised P(3HB- co-3HV) with up to 
31 mol% 3HV via succinyl-CoA when cultivated on glycerol (unrelated carbon 
source) as shown in Figure 1.18 (Aldor et al., 2002 & Aldor et al., 2003).  Metabolic engineering of B. cereus SPV  
 144Poly(3HB- co-4HB) is another useful PHA copolym er used in drug delivery, tissue 
scaffolds and composite development among other uses. In another metabolic engineering approach, succinyl-CoA, de rived from the breakdown of glucose ( via 
the TCA cycle), was converted to 4-hydroxybutyrate for Poly(3HB- co-4HB) 
production in recombinant E. coli harbouring the C. necator PHA operon and the 
Clostridium kluyveri succinate degradation genes thus  circumventing the need for 
the addition of immediate precursors such as 4-hydroxybutyrate, 1, 4- butanediol or 
gamma butyrolactone for the copolymer synthesis (Valen tin and Dennis, 1997). This 
is illustrated using a schematic as shown in Figure 7.7.

 145In conclusion, the recombinant B. cereus  SPV that has been developed in the current 
study should possess all the necessary genes for the accumulation of 3HV containing copolymer, when grown in a simple ine xpensive carbon source such as glucose, 
through the MCM pathway. Unfortunately, due to the time constraints, further work 
related to the production of P(3HB-co-3HV) using the recombinant   B. cereus SPV 
strain and its optimisation could not be undertaken. However, this work marks the 
beginning of a new approach, using metabo lic pathway engineering methods, in the 
production of the copolymer P(3HB- co-3HV) using B. cereus  SPV. Such novel 
processes for the production of P(3HB- co-3HV) and other useful copolymers using 
genetically engineered organisms would be  an industrially useful step forward.

  Conclusions and future work  
 1468.1 Conclusions  
The sbm gene encoding methylmalonyl-CoA  mutase (MCM) was identified and 
reported to be located at 62.3min on the E. coli  chromosome (Roy and Leadlay, 
1992). This discovery opened up an interest ing area of research involving the new 
and unexplored metabolic pathway in the organism. This study is based on earlier 
growth studies of E. coli  (Kolodziej et al ., 1968 & Wegener et al ., 1968) and       
13C-NMR analyses (Evans et al., 1993; Textor et al., 1997 & London et al., 1999) of 
the growth of E. coli  on fatty acids such as propi onate, and the recognition of the 
sbm gene as part of a four gene operon possibly involved  in succinate utilisation 
(Haller et al., 2000). A detailed examination of va rious aspects of the expression of 
the gene has been investigated in an atte mpt to elucidate the metabolic role of MCM 
in E. coli . In addition to this basic research, th is study has also laid the foundation of 
utilising the sbm gene product in metabolic engineering experiments. 
 A comparative growth study was carried out using wild type E. coli K12, TR6524 
and the  sbm  insertion mutant, FA1P1, in minimal media with glucose, succinate or 
propionate as the sole source of carbon. Gr owth on glucose showed no particular 
difference in the growth patte rns of the two strains leadi ng to the conclusion that the 
pathway employing the sbm gene product (MCM) was not crucial in the utilisation 
of glucose. An appreciable difference between  the growth of the wild type strain and 
the mutant strain was observed in minima l media with succinate as the sole carbon 
source. This showed that the sbm pathway had a pivotal role in the metabolism of 
this dicarboxylic acid, possibly involvi ng the decarboxylation of succinate to 
propionate as proposed by Haller et al ., 2000. However, a change in the 
concentration of vitamin B
12 (MCM being a coenzyme B 12 dependent enzyme) did 
not seem to have an effect on the growth of the wild ty pe strain, as it should have. 
This was probably because the concentration of vitamin B 12 being used was 
saturating at the lowest concentration used. The growth of the wild type E. coli  and 
the sbm disruption mutant in minimal media with propionate as the sole carbon 
source was also compared. A minor differe nce in the growth pattern was observed 
between the two strains duri ng the mid-log phase, however, growth parameters such Conclusions and future work  
 147as doubling time and doubling rate were al most identical (Tab le 2.3). Unlike in 
succinate, the increase in vitamin B 12 concentration ha d a slight positive effect on 
the growth of E. coli  TR6524. These results indicate that the mutation in the sbm 
gene in FA1P1 was compensated for, by ot her pathways (such as the methylcitrate 
pathway) providing it the ability  to cope with propionate as  the sole carbon source.  
 The identification of a σS controlled promoter (50% and 83% sequence identity at 
the -10 and -35 regions, respectively) 29 bases upstream of the sbm operon, 
indicated that sbm was induced under stress conditions , such as growth in minimal 
media with difficult carbon sources (such as succinate or pr opionate), nutrient 
depletion, or stationary phase. A search  for consensus sequences with genes 
encoding other regulatory proteins, su ch as the FNR and ArcA, led to the 
identification of sequences with 45% and 80% homology, respectively, about 100-
200 bases upstream of sbm, suggesting the possibility of the involvement of a 
network of regulatory proteins in sbm gene expression.  
 Further, an increase in the mRNA levels corresponding to the sbm, arg K and  ygfG 
genes was observed as growth prog ressed through the th ree phases when E. coli  
TR6524 cells were grown in the presence of  succinate or propi onate as the sole 
source of carbon as compared to  when grown in the presence  of glucose. This was in 
agreement with the finding that the sbm operon was under the control of σS, (rpoS 
gene product), responsible for the induction of  genes required to cope with survival 
during stress conditions and stationary phase . In contrast, a relative increase in 
mRNA levels corresponding to the  ygfH (which codes for propionyl-CoA: succinyl-
CoA transferase) gene was observed in the early log phase of growth. This indicated 
that this gene product possibly pl ays a role in the adaptation of E. coli  for the 
utilisation of succinate or propionate and is possibly the rate limiting step in the 
pathway proposed by Haller et al., 2000. Hence, the increased level of transcription 
indicates a major role during the early-l og phase of growth of the organism. 
Amongst the four genes, the change in  the mRNA levels corresponding to the ygfD 
(or argK) gene is not as much as seen in the case of the other genes. This is Conclusions and future work  
 148consistent with the proposed pathway of Haller et al., 2000, which did not include 
the product of this gene (Figure 1.14). The ygfD (or argK) gene product is 
homologous to the MeaB protein  found in Methylobacter extorquens  AM1. It is 
known to function as a chaperone protein re quired for the stability of Mea A protein, 
a known mutase involved in the conversi on of butyryl CoA to propionyl CoA. 
Hence, it can be assumed that ygfD, in addition to its known role in lysine-arginine-
ornithine transport is also a possible chaper one protein required for the stability of 
the Sbm protein. This postulate is reinfo rced by the fact that  Sbm protein when 
expressed on its own in E. coli , without a histidine tag, was found to be inactive 
(Haller et al., 2000; Bobik and Rasche, 2003 & I. Roy,  PhD thesis). This role as a 
chaperone does not possibly require a marked  variation in the mRNA levels of this 
gene.   The MCM enzyme activity measurement in th e whole cell extracts of the wild type 
E. coli K12 grown under the abov e mentioned conditions le d to the first ever 
measurement of MCM activity in wild type E. coli  These measurements also 
revealed a four fold increase of the MCM specific activity in the case of growth in 
succinate (4.76x10
-3U/mg) and a two fold increase for growth in propionate 
(2.79x10-3U/mg) compared to that observed with growth in glucose             
(1.37x10-3U/mg). These results for the first time  indicate a strong involvement of the 
enzyme in succinate utilisation, and to a lesse r extent in propionate utilisation, owing 
to the multiple pathways that could be in operation (Textor et al., 1997; London et 
al., 1999). These results also correlate well  with the data from the comparative 
growth study (where a significant differen ce was observed in the growth pattern of 
the two strains in succinate and less so in propionate), the promoter analysis 
(identification of sequence consensus w ith the stress related, stationary phase 
induced sigma factor, σS) and the transcription analysis (increased level of mRNA 
corresponding to sbm from cells grown in succinate).  
 The proteomic analysis to understa nd the gene expression pattern of E. coli  TR6524 
was carried out using cells harvested at the stationary phase of growth from all the Conclusions and future work  
 149above mentioned growth conditions (minim al media with glucose, succinate or 
propionate as the sole sour ces of carbon). The Sbm prot ein was not identified among 
the protein spots analysed in this study. However, the growth conditions led to 
induction of the expression of transport (H isJ, DppA) and energy generating proteins 
(PckA, AceF) required by E. coli  to cope with the difficult growth conditions. 
Analysis of only a limited number of protei n spots due to financ ial constraints and 
the low sensitivity of gel based assays with coomassie blue based detection methods could have led to the lack  of detection of Sbm. The results corres ponded well with 
previous studies that have re ported the identification of pr oteins involved in coping 
with difficult carbon sources (long-chain fatty acids) an d nutrient depletion (fed 
batch cultures and glucose limitation)  (dis cussed in detail in Chapter 6) providing a 
better understanding of the ability of E. coli  to adapt its metabolism to 
environmental alterations.  
 Finally, as a first step in the process to study the eff ect of MCM on P(3HB-co-3HV) 
production, the E. coli  K12 sbm gene was successfully cloned into B. cereus SPV 
leading to the development of a metabo lically engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate 
producing strain of B. cereus . The introduction of the sbm gene into B. cereus  should 
result in a natural intracellu lar source of propionyl-CoA leading to the production of 
the P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymer from stru cturally non related carbon sources like 
glucose. Hence, the recombinant strain should allow production of  P(3HB-co-3HV) 
without the need to supply propionate exte rnally. This would lead to a relatively 
cheaper production of this i ndustrially useful copolymer.  
  This study thus showed, for the first time, direct experimental  evidence of the role of 
the sbm gene and the other genes in the sbm operon, in the utilisation of propionate 
and succinate in E. coli  K12. Hence, one of the meta bolic roles of methylmalonyl-
CoA mutase in E. coli  is to facilitate the utilisation of unus ual carbon sources. This 
study marks the beginning of the recogniti on of a new metabolic pathway involving 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in E. coli . 
 Conclusions and future work  
 1508.2 Future work  
This study on MCM from E. coli  has provided an interesting insight into the role of 
the sbm  gene containing operon in the metabolic networks involved in E. coli . The 
metabolic role of these new reactions, need further detailed probing in order to obtain a clear idea of the metabolic path ways involved. Some possible experiments 
to be carried out in th e future could include,  
 
8.2.1 Comparative growth analyses  
13C-NMR analyses have shown wild type E. coli  to utilise propionate via the 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and th e methylcitrate pathway (Evans et al ., 1993; 
Textor et al., 1997 & London et al., 1999). The experimental data from this study 
has revealed that, in the presence of vitamin B 12 in the media, pr opionate is possibly 
utilised via the carboxylation pathway that i nvolves a reaction catalysed by MCM 
confirming the findings of Evans et al ., 1993. In order to provide conclusive 
evidence of propionate utilisa tion by the MCM pathway, the prpC gene (encoding 
methylcitrate synthase) in the  sbm  mutant FA1P1 and the wild type E. coli , could be 
inactivated. Comparative growth analyses in minimal media with added vitamin B 12 
and propionate as the sole source of car bon could be repeated as described in 
Chapter 2 of this study. The interpretati on of the results would be based on the 
ability of the sbm-prpC mutant (referred to as double mutant) and the prpC mutant 
to grow in minimal media with propionate  as the sole source of carbon. If the double 
mutant is unable to grow or exhibits a significant lag phase during its growth, it can 
be concluded that both the prpC and sbm genes are important for propionate 
metabolism in E. coli . Similarly, if the prpC mutant is able to grow with a growth 
pattern analogous to that of  the wild type, it can be concluded that the MCM 
pathway compensates for the loss of the me thylcitrate pathway. Th is can be further 
confirmed using the 13C NMR analysis similar to that carried out in previous 
research (London et al., 1999) to confirm and provide conclusive evidence for the 
utilisation of propionate through the MCM pathway.  
 
 Conclusions and future work  
 1518.2.2 Growth analyses under anaerobic conditions 
Salmon et al . (2004) used microarray analys is and indicated that the E. coli sbm  
gene could be under the regul ation of the FNR regulon whic h controls expression of 
genes under anaerobic conditions (Salmon et al., 2004). Also, literatu re suggests that 
a single gene can be regulated by a ne twork of regulons (Hengge-Aronis, 2002 & 
Salmon et al ., 2004). The promoter search appro ach used in the present study 
showed a sequence consensus with that of  FNR about 100-200 bases upstream of the 
sbm operon. Hence, it would be interesting to design experiments to culture the 
bacteria under anaerobic conditions usi ng minimal media with electron acceptors 
such as fumarate in an anaerobic chambe r followed by transcription analyses and 
proteomics to establish the relati onship between the FNR regulon and sbm. This 
would provide a complete picture of the role of sbm in E. coli  metabolism under 
anaerobic conditions.   
8.2.3 Microarray analysis  
A microarray analysis (Gygi et al ., 2003 & Salmon et al ., 2003) following the 
growth of E. coli  on minimal media with succinate or propionate as the sole source 
of carbon and under both aerobic and an aerobic conditions, would reveal the 
possible regulatory networks involved in the regulation of the expression of sbm and 
other genes involved in the utilisation of  these carbon sources, in addition to the 
already existing data obtained  through such studies using the bacteria. There is a 
strong possibility that the microa rray approach will indicate the sbm induction 
condition(s).  
8.2.4 Expression proteomics  
The proteomics approach used in this proj ect revealed that growth in minimal media 
with unusual carbon sources su ch as succinate or propiona te induced transporter and 
energy generating proteins that helped cope with the growth conditions used. 
However, only some protein spots could be  analysed and in the stationary phase. 
This could be further extended to protein extract from cells harvested at log phase 
and an analysis of all the spots that app ear on the gels. In addition, protein samples Conclusions and future work  
 152can be isoelectrically fo cused in narrow range ( e.g. 4.0-6.0) IPG strips also known as 
ultra zoom gels (Hoving et al ., 2002) targeting protein(s) of interest (here, Sbm) 
followed by routine MS analysis.  
8.2.5 Expression of sbm and P(3HB-co-3HV ) production using the recombinant B. cereus 
SPV strain 
Finally, the metabolic engineering of the polyhydroxyalkanoate producing Bacillus 
cereus  SPV, which had only been started n eeds follow through and completion. The 
appropriate conditions for th e over-expression of Sbm have to be determined and its 
effect verified. This would require co mparison of P(3HB-co-3HV) accumulation by 
the genetically engineered B. cereus  SPV and wild type B. cereus  SPV strains grown 
in polymer production media (Valappil et al., 2007b) with the simple, inexpensive 
and structurally unrelated carbon source such as glucose. NMR analysis of the 
purified polymer would provide  the percentage of the copolymer recovered. Once 
successful production of P(3HB- co-3HV) is achieved, this strain can be used for the 
large scale production of the copolymer.

 1649.2 Methods 
9.2.1 Genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation and PCR amplification for verification of the 
deletion mutation  
Genomic DNA was isolated from E. coli  TR6524 and the sbm insertion mutant 
FA1P1 using the Promega DNA Wizard kit fo llowing the manufacturer’s protocol. 
The genomic DNA isolated from the wild type and mutant E. coli  K12 was 
quantified using A 260nm. 1.0µg of the DNA was used fo r subsequent PCR reactions. 
The primers used ( iciA2, R55, F33  and sbm11 ) are listed in Table 9.1 (genetic 
analysis, materials Section, 9.1.5) and their position on the E. coli  FA1P1 
chromosome is shown (Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1).  The PCR reactions were carried 
out at 3 different annealing temperatures namely 50oC, 55oC and 60oC in order to 
optimise the conditions for the reaction. The fi nal PCR amplification cycle used is as 
shown below in Table 9.3.

in FA1P1 
 
The products obtained were se parated on a 0.8% agarose ge l in TBE with a suitable 
marker DNA as described by Sambrook et al., 1989. 
 
9.2.2 Comparative growth analyses 
Each strain of E. coli  K12 (wild type TR6524 and the sbm mutant FA1P1) was 
plated on to 2TY medium. The mutants were grown on plates with kanamycin 
(20µg/mL, final concentration) in order to  maintain the Mu dJ insertion in the sbm 
gene. Routinely, overnight cultures of the bacteria were grown in 2TY media at 30 
cyclesMaterials and methods 
 16537oC. Following this, 100mL of M9 minima l salts media containing glucose, 
succinate or propionate as sole sources of  carbon, was inoculated with the overnight 
culture of either strain. The mutant was always grown in media containing 
kanamycin. The final concentration of vitamin B 12 in the minimal media was 
maintained at 0.05µg/mL, 0.5µg/mL (Evans et al., 1993) or 5µg/mL and the final 
concentration of bicarbonate was maintained at 5mM (Evans et al., 1993). The three 
different concentrations of vitamin B 12 were chosen in order to  observe the effect of 
vitamin B 12 concentration on the growth pattern of the wild type and the mutant E. 
coli strains. The inoculum, cultured indivi dually in three different vitamin B 12 
concentrations, was maintained at 1% of th e culture volume in all cases and the cells 
were allowed to adapt to the media at 37oC and reach an OD 600nm of 0.5. Once an 
actively growing culture was obtained, the adapted culture was further used to 
inoculate 600mL of the minima l media and incubated at 37oC. This inoculation was 
approximately 1% of the culture volume ( i.e. 6mL), however, it was also ensured 
that the same number of cells was used in  each experiment. This made the growth 
curves comparable. The growth  pattern was followed using A 600 readings and a 
growth curve plotted. The experiment  was carried out in triplicates. 
 
Stock solution of vitamin B 12 (5mg/mL) was prepared, sterilised and stored in the 
dark at -20oC for use in the growth experiments. 
                 
9.2.3 RNA isolation 
The cells grown in large scale (600mL) mi nimal media with the three carbon sources 
(glucose, succinate or propionate) were harv ested at different time points (early log, 
mid log and stationary phases) of growt h. These cells were then frozen at -80oC for 
RNA isolation. RNA isolation was carried out using TRI Reagent (Sigma, UK). The 
manufacturer’s protocol wa s followed with some modifications. The volume of TRI 
Reagent used to resuspend the cell pelle t obtained from 5mL of cell culture was 
reduced to 150µL as this prevented the dilution of the RNA sample. The volume of 
all the reagents used in the isolati on procedure was altered accordingly.  RNA 
precipitation was carried out at -80oC overnight, and the total RNA obtained was Materials and methods 
 166suspended in 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate (D EPC) treated water, quantified using 
A260nm measurements and frozen at -80oC for future use or was reverse transcribed to 
complimentary DNA (cDNA) as soon as possible. 
 
9.2.4 cDNA preparation 
1.0µg of RNA was used for the reverse tr anscription reaction (ImProm II Reverse 
Transcription System). The cDNA was synthesised following the manufacturer’s 
technical manual (Technical manual 236). The random hexamers provided in the kit were used for the cDNA preparation.  
 
9.2.5 PCR for RT-PCR 
The cDNA prepared was amplified by conve ntional PCR using primer sequences 3, 
4 and 5 (Table 9.1, Section 9.1.5). The magnesium ion concentration in the reaction 
was increased to 3.0mM final concentration as this was found to produce discrete 
bright bands. The amplification progra m used is shown in Table 9.3, Section 9.2.1. 
The products were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TBE with a suitable DNA marker. 
 
9.2.6 Real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR)       
The QPCR study was aimed to verify and extend the results obtained by the 
conventional PCR techniques. This met hod allows quantification of the gene 
expression and helps to observe the product formation in real time. The SYBR green 
jump start ready mix kit from Sigma (UK)  was used for the amplification reaction. 
The reaction mix for each reaction compri sed 12.5µL of the master mix, 0.25µL of 
ROX (reference dye), 2µL of the cDNA template, 1µL each of the forward and the reverse primers (0.4µM fina l concentration, for the co rresponding genes of the sbm 
operon) and nuclease free wate r to a final volume of 25µL.  The primers used for the 
amplification of the four genes in the sbm containing operon we re 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 
shown in Table 9.1 (Section 9.1.5). The amp lification was performed in an ABI 
Prism 7000 Real-time thermal cycler on a 96 well optical plate (ABI Biosystems, 
UK) and the thermal cycling parameters used were as follows: 2min at 50
oC and 
10min at 95oC, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 15s at 95oC and 1min at 60oC. A Materials and methods 
 16710-fold serial dilution series of the gel purified PCR amplification products of the 
four genes sbm, ygfG, ygfH and argK, each ranging from 1x102 to 1x105 copies/µL 
was used to construct the standard curv es for absolute quantification of mRNA 
concentration.  
 
9.2.7 Protein studies 
9.2.7.1 Protein sample preparation  
Protein sample preparations for 2 dimens ional electrophoresis (2DE) were made as 
described earlier  (Peng et al., 2003) with some modifications. Cell pellets obtained 
from the stationary phase of growth in large scale M9 minimal media containing 
glucose, succinate or propionate as the so le source of carbon were washed twice in 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at neutral pH  and re-suspended in 3mL of the same. 
The cells were then lysed by sonica tion with a sonication cycle of 10 x 20 seconds. 
The cell lysate was centrifuged at 20000g for 30min at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge. 
The supernatant was then dialysed using a dialysis bag with 10KDa cut off range, 
against distilled water, at 4 °C overnight. The distilled wa ter was changed at least 
thrice during the dialysis. The dialysate was lyophilised and the resulting protein 
powder was solubilised in 1mL of lysis buffer, stored as aliquots at -80oC until 
further use. The Bradford protein assa y (Bradford, 1976) was carried out on the 
lysate to quantify the total protein content.  
 
9.2.7.2 SDS-PAGE 
Protein samples (20µg) we re diluted in reducing 2 X sample buffer (Section 9.1.8.4), 
boiled for 5min and allowed to cool down to  room temperature. Electrophoresis was 
carried out using a 10% polyacrylamide ge l,  initially at 80V for 15min till the 
samples migrated into the separating gel and then at 120V fo r 60min, in running 
buffer.  
9.2.7.3 Two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE/ 2DE)  
2-DE experiments were carried out on a 7cm IPG strip pH 3-10, non linear, 
according to Gorg et al ., 2000, with slight modifica tions. 100µg of protein was Materials and methods 
 168diluted in rehydration buffer and gel rehydra tion was performed at room temperature 
overnight. The IPG strip was overlaid wi th molecular biology grade mineral oil 
(Sigma, UK) to prevent drying during re hydration. First dimensional IEF was 
performed at 18°C under the following conditions: 300V for 30min; 600V for 
30min; 3500V for 2 hours and 44min. Th e multiphor tray was overlaid with 
molecular biology grade mineral oil during IEF in order to prevent the gel from 
drying or burning at the high voltage. Th e focused IPG strip was stored at -80oC 
until further use.  In the second dimension, the focused IPG st rips were equilibrated for 15 minutes in 
equilibration Solution I and for another 15m in in equilibration Solution II described 
in Section 9.1.8.1.5 (Peng et al ., 2003). Equilibrated IPG strips were loaded onto 
10% acrylamide gel and covered with sealing buffer. The gels were run initially at 80V for 15min to let the protein samples to migrate into the gel and then at 150V for 
1 hour and 45min, in running buffer.  
9.2.7.4 Fixing of proteins 
Following the separation using electrophoresis, the proteins were subject to a fixing 
protocol that allowed the proteins to be fixed. The gels were flooded with the protein 
fixing solution for 30min. 
 
9.2.7.5 Coomassie brilliant blue staining 
Protein gels were then stained for 60min in the coomassie brilliant blue staining 
solution and then de-stained for three hour s in the de-staini ng solution. The gels 
were then stored in HPLC grade water at 4oC until further analyses. The protein 
spots were analysed using the Progene sis Samespots software (Non-Linear 
Dynamics, UK) and the gel images were captured using BioRad densitometer.  
 
  Materials and methods 
 1699.2.8 HPLC assay for MCM activity  
9.2.8.1 Plasmid DNA extraction and purification  
The genes coding for methylmalonyl CoA mutase from P ropionibacterium 
shermanii  were originally cloned into a pMEX2 plasmid (Marsh et al., 1989). The 
protein extract obtained following the e xpression of the genes under suitable 
conditions was used for the positive cont rol reactions to observe MCM activity. 
Previously, Haller et al . (2000) and Bobik and Rasche (2003) have observed the 
activity of His-tagge d purified Sbm from E. coli  in their studies. The present study 
aimed, for the first time, to assay the activity of the enzyme as a part of the total protein from wild type E. coli  TR6524 grown in minimal media with glucose, 
succinate or propionate as the sole source of carbon. The pMEX2 plasmid was 
isolated by following a modified prot ocol described previously (Sambrook et al ., 
1989). A 10mL overnight culture of E. coli  DH5α containing plasmid pMEX2, 
grown in LB broth with a suitable antib iotic (here, ampicillin 100µg/mL final 
concentration) was harvested by centrifuging at 6000g for 10min in a Sorvall Legend RT centrifuge. All the centrifuga tion steps were carried out at 4
oC. The cells 
were then re-suspended in 250µL of Solu tion I, 250µL of So lution II and 300µL of 
Solution III (section 9.1.8.2). The cells were mixed gently by inversion and 
centrifuged at 16000g for 12min. The supern atant was transferred into a fresh 
eppendorf tube and gently mixed with equal volumes of phenol: chloroform: 
isoamylalcohol solution (Invitrogen, UK) by inverting the tube. Following 
centrifugation at 16000g for 12min the supernatant was then transferred into a fresh 
eppendorf tube and mixed with equal volum es of isopropanol and the mixture was 
centrifuged at 16000g for 20min  to precipitate the plasmid DNA. The supernatant 
was discarded and the precipitated DNA wa s washed with 70% ethanol by repeated 
pipetting and centrifuged at 16000g fo r 5min. The ethanol was removed by 
aspiration and another centr ifugation step (16000g, 2min) followed. This step was 
carried out to remove any remaining et hanol in the tube. The plasmid DNA was 
allowed to dry at 37oC for 10-15min and re-suspended in 30µL of sterile HPLC 
grade water and frozen at -20oC for further use. About 1µL of the isolated plasmid Materials and methods 
 170DNA was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel (Sambrook et al., 1989) for confirmation 
of size and purity with a suitable molecular weight marker.  The plasmid DNA extraction procedure was mo dified with one additional step when 
carried out with B. subtilis  and B. cereus  cells. The cells were treated with 100µL of 
30mg/mL lysozyme following the re-suspension of the cell pellet in Solution I and incubated at 37
oC for 30 minutes with frequent mixing to prevent them from settling 
down. This facilitated the breakage of th e intact Gram positive cell wall. This was 
followed by the addition of Solutions II and III and the routine protocol was followed thereafter. 
9.2.8.2 Transformation of E. coli  BL21-DE3 cells                
9.2.8.2.1 Preparation of electro-competent E. coli  BL21-DE3 cells  
E. coli  BL21-DE3 electro-competent cells were  prepared and transformed using the 
method described by Dower et al., (1988). 100µL of an overn ight culture of BL21-
DE3 cells (originally frozen as glycer ol deeps) grown in LB broth at 37oC shaken at 
200rpm was used to inoculate 100mL of fres h LB broth that was incubated at the 
same growth conditions. An optical density between 0.7-0.8 measured at A 600nm 
using a Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer was used as an indicat ion to harvest the 
cells for competent cells preparation. The cells were washed in cold 1mM HEPES 
(pH 6.8) and 20% glycerol in alternating steps. The harvested cells were suspended in 25mL of 1mM HEPES and centrifuged at  6000g for 10min. The cells were then 
washed in 20% glycerol and centrifuged as above. This procedure was repeated 
three times and the cells were finally susp ended in 40µL of 20% glycerol and placed 
in dry ice.  The frozen cells  were then stored at -80
oC until further use. The cells 
were treated with great care and handled very gently as they were fragile due to a 
weakened cell wall.  
9.2.8.2.2 Transformation by electroporation 
A BioRad Gene Pulser Xcell electroporat ion unit was used for the transformation. 
Two tubes containing 40 μL of electrocompetent E. coli  BL21-DE3 (one for the test, 
another for the control reactions) were pl aced on ice 5min before the pulse was Materials and methods 
 171provided. One micro litre of the pMEX2 plasmid DNA was added to the test 
reaction tube and mixed by gently tapping on the side of the tube. The contents were left on ice for 5min and then gently transferred to a previously chilled electroporation cuvette (BioRad, UK) with a 0.2cm electrode gap. Care was taken to 
avoid introducing any air bubbles as this w ould affect the electroporation. A voltage 
of 2500V, a capacitance of 25µF and a resistance of 200 Ω were used for providing 
the single optimal pulse (of 4.8-5.2m s or 12.5kV/cm) required for the 
transformation. About 200µL of the rec overy SOC medium (Section 9.1.7.4) was 
added immediately to the cuvette with th e possible transformants and the contents 
were gently transferred to a fres h eppendorf tube and incubated at 37
oC and shaken 
at 200rpm for about 60-90min to allow th e cells to recover. The procedure was 
repeated with the cells in the tube marked  ‘control reaction’ excep t that sterile HPLC 
grade water was used instead of the plasmid DNA. Following incubation in SOC medium the cells were then spread ont o LB agar plates containing 100µg/mL 
ampicillin and incubated at 37
oC overnight and checked for the growth of the 
transformants. 
9.2.8.3 Expression of the gene encoding MCM from pMEX2 
The transformants from the ampicillin contai ning LB plates were  grown in LB broth 
containing antibiotic and colonies obtained were grown in liquid LB and stored as 
frozen glycerol deeps for future reference and use. In E. coli  BL21 DE3, the 
expression of the MCM protein was under the influence of a T7  promoter controlled 
by the concentration of the T7  polymerase which in turn  was under the control of a 
lac promoter, induced by the presence of IP TG in the growth medium. In order to 
maximise the expression of the MCM prot ein, a range of IPTG concentrations and 
induction conditions were tested. The best expression was observed in the presence 
of 1mM IPTG in the medium and when the cells were grown to an optical density 
(OD 600nm) of 0.6 at 28oC and incubated at 18oC overnight. The cells were aerated by 
shaking them at 200rpm. The primary i noculum was grown in LB broth at 37oC 
overnight and 1mL of this was transfe rred into 100mL of fresh LB broth and 
incubated at 28oC before induction and at 18oC following induction with IPTG and Materials and methods 
 172shaken at 200rpm. The cells were harv ested and re-suspended in the sonication 
buffer (Section 9.1.8.1.7).  500µL of the cell suspension was boiled with equal 
amounts of 2x sample buffer (Section 9.1.8.1.2) for 5-10min and respective protein 
bands indicative of the expression was checked by running the samples in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stai ned as described in Section 9.2.7.5. The 
confirmation of over-expression was carried  out using controls (non transformed 
Escherichia coli  BL21-DE3) and un-induced transf ormed cell samples that were 
prepared and separated alongside suitable molecular weight marker.  
9.2.8.4 Preparation of whole cell extract fo r positive control reaction for HPLC 
assay 
The conditions for the over-expression of the genes codi ng for MCM from  
P. shermanii  were optimised, and the over-expressed protein was used in the 
positive control reaction with an active MCM. The transformed E. coli  BL21-DE3 
cells, containing the plasmid pMEX2, were cu ltured in 100mL of the broth (in order 
to produce sufficient protein) under the optimised expression conditions in the 
presence of 100µg/mL (final concentration)  ampicillin. The cells were harvested and 
re-suspended in 3-5mL of freshly made  sonication buffer (9.1.8.1.7) and sonicated 
using the MS73 probe as described S ection 9.2.7.1. The lysed cells were then 
centrifuged in a Sorv all SL-50T rotor at  18000g for 30min at 4
oC. The supernatant 
containing the total cell extract was then us ed for the reaction that would eventually 
be detected using a HPLC assay ba sed on the method developed by Riedel et al., 
1995. The mobile phase used was a phosphate buffer and methanol gradient and the 
assay was carried out at 39oC with a flow rate of 2mL/min.  
9.2.8.5 Preparation of the total cell extr act from minimal me dia for reactions 
prior to the HPLC assay 
Cell pellets obtained from the early statio nary phase growth in large scale M9 
minimal media containing glucose, succinate or propionate as th e sole source of 
carbon were washed twice in phosphate buffe red saline (PBS) at neutral pH and re-
suspended in 3mL of the sonication buffer. The cells were then lysed by sonication Materials and methods 
 173with a sonication cycle of 10 x 20 seconds. The cell lysate  was centrifuged at 18000g 
for 30min at 4 °C in a Sorvall centrifuge with a SL-50T rotor.  
9.2.8.6 HPLC assay for the detection of the activity of MCM in positive control 
and test samples                   
9.2.8.6.1 HPLC assay- standard curve 
Commercially available lithium salt of th e substrate methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA) 
and sodium salt of the product succinyl Co A were purchased from Sigma, UK and 
stock solutions of 600µM concentrations we re prepared by dissolving the salt in the 
eluting phosphate buffer (pH 4.6) pr epared as described by Riedel et al., 1995. The 
stock solutions were then serially dilu ted to obtain a seri es of decreasing 
concentrations (500µM, 400µM, 300µM, 200µM and a 100µM) in order to produce 
a standard calibration curve. The salts were dissolved just before they were ready to 
be used in the reaction or before injection into the column in the case of the standard 
curve.  20µL of the standards or the samples (prote in extract from cells used as positive 
control and protein extract from the cells grown in mi nimal media with glucose, 
succinate or propionate as the sole s ource of carbon, described in Section 9.2.8.5) 
were manually injected into the reverse phase C-18 Dionex column connected to the 
Dionex Summit HPLC detection system. Th e elution buffer preparation and the 
detection protocol were followed acco rding to that described by Riedel et al., 1995. 
 
9.2.8.6.2 HPLC assay of the positive control MCM protein from P. shermanii  and the 
protein extract from E. coli  K12 cells grown under different conditions of growth 
The MCM assay was performed according to Riedel et al., 1995 with modifications 
where the final volume of the reaction was re duced to half of that specified. For the 
enzyme assay, 25µL of the total protein extr act was incubated in the dark with 10µL 
of the 1mM coenzyme B 12 for 2 hours at 4°C (Dr. Ipsita Roy, personal 
communication). The reaction was starte d with the addition of 60µL of 600µM 
methylmalonyl CoA to the protein-coenzyme B 12 mix and incubated at 37°C. The Materials and methods 
 174reaction was stopped following incubation (at 5, 10, 20, 40 minute intervals) using 
35µL of 10% trichloroacetic acid. This tim e range facilitated the observation of 
decreasing and increasing p eak intensities of the substrate (MMCoA) and the 
product (succinyl CoA) respectively, duri ng the assay. The mixture was centrifuged 
at 13000g for 3min and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh eppendorf tube and frozen at -80
oC until the HPLC analysis. Whole cell extracts of the homogenates 
without methylmalonyl-CoA were also anal ysed in order to detect peaks of the 
metabolites present in the extracts prior to the MCM catalysed reaction. A negative 
control reaction was also carried out with water as the sample instead of any total protein extract.   The reactions and the assay were carried out for the ove r-expressed positive control 
protein extract from E. coli  BL21 DE3 transformed with pMEX2 and repeated with 
the protein samples from the wild type E. coli  (TR6524) cell pellets obtained from 
the early stationary phase growth in la rge scale M9 minimal media containing 
glucose, succinate or propionate as the sole source of carbon. The protein sample 
preparation, the reaction and the assay were  carried out on the same day and storage 
of any of the sample or reaction mixture we re avoided as the salts of the coenzyme 
A have a limited life in solution (Riedel et al., 1995) 
9.2.9 Cloning of the sbm gene into Bacillus cereus  SPV 
It has been shown that some bacteria (such as Nocardia  and Rhodobacter ) produce 
polyhydroxyalkanoate co-polymers by using the MCM pathway. In order to observe the influence of the sbm gene in the production of P(3HB-co-3HV) in B. cereus , the 
sbm gene from wild type E. coli  TR6524 was cloned into B. cereus  and an attempt 
was made to study the effect of  the inclusion of this gene. 
  
9.2.9.1 Amplification of sbm from pEX3 
The plasmid construct pEX3 contains the E. coli  sbm gene cloned into pT7-18 
(obtained from Dr. Ipsita Roy). PCR primers were designed to amplify the sbm gene 
from pEX3 with restriction endonuclease sites incorporat ed into them so as to Materials and methods 
 175produce sticky ends or overha ngs that help in routine cloning experiments. The 
choice of these restriction sites was based on the sites present in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the E. coli - Gram positive shuttle vector (ECE 190 or pHCMC05, 
Nguyen et al., 2005) obtained from BGSC, Ohio, US A. Care was taken to exclude 
all restriction enzymes which may have sites within the sbm gene. This resulted in 
designing the forward and reverse pr imers with restriction sites for XbaI and XmaI 
respectively (Table 9.1, section 9.1.5). The plasmid DNA was extracted and purified 
as described earlier in Section 8.2.8.1. One microgram of the plasmid DNA was then 
used in a routine polymerase chain reaction to amplify the gene using Taq 
polymerase from Promega, UK. The PCR Master mix (Promega, UK) was used in a 100µL reaction as specified by the manufact urer. The reaction cycle used was as 
described in Table 9.3, Section 9.2.1.  The amplified product was then separated on 
a 0.8% agarose gel and the produ ct subjected to pur ification and used in subsequent 
cloning. 
9.2.9.2 Gel purification of PCR amplified sbm gene 
The PCR product that was cut out of the gel was purified using the QIAquick gel 
extraction kit from Qiagen, UK. The manufacturer’s protocol (page 23-24, 
QIAquick spin handbook) was followed for the purification steps. 30µL of sterile 
HPLC grade water was used for eluting the purified DNA instead of the elution 
buffer provided in the kit. The eluted PCR product was stored at -20oC until further 
use.  
9.2.9.3 Preparation of vector DNA 
The E. coli - Gram positive shuttle vector (pHC MC05, Figure 9.1) was received as a 
plasmid suspension from BGSC, Ohio Stat e University, Ohio, USA. In order to 
produce adequate quantities of  the vector for future cl oning experiments, it was 
cloned into E. coli  DH5α cells by electroporation. Th e electrocompetent cell 
preparation and the transformation proced ure used were as described earlier in 
Sections 9.2.8.2.1 and 9.2.8.2.2 resp ectively. The transformant s were then grown in 
10mL LB broth containi ng the appropriate antibio tic and incubated at 37oC 
overnight at 200rpm. Following overnig ht growth, glycerol deeps of the Materials and methods 
 176transformants were made  and stored at -80oC. The remainder of the broth culture 
was used for plasmid isolation and purific ation as described in section 9.2.8.1. The 
vector was then stored at -20oC till further use.  
 
 
 
Figure 9.1: Restriction map of the E. coli - Gram positive shuttle vector, pHCMC05 (Nguyen et 
al., 2005). 
9.2.9.4 Restriction digestion of the PCR product and the vector DNA 
The gel purified PCR product and the vector DNA, pHCMC05, were subject to a 
double restriction digestion reaction using the same pair of enzymes, XbaI and XmaI. 
The reaction mix contained 30µL of the ge l purified PCR product or the vector 
DNA, 5µL of the reaction buffer supplied w ith the restriction enzymes, 0.5µL of 
BSA supplied with the restriction endoculeas es, 2µL of bovine pancreatic RNAse A, 
5µL of each of the restriction enzymes a nd water to make up a total reaction volume 
of 50µL. The reaction mix was gently mi xed by repeated pipetting and the tubes 
were incubated at 37oC for 4 hours. At the end of th e third hour of incubation, 1µL 
of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (C IP) was added to the reaction tubes to 
prevent the religation of the restricted ends of the DNA. At the end of the 
Xma I Materials and methods 
 177incubation, CIP was inactivated by incubating the reaction tubes at 60oC for 5min. 
The digested samples were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel with a suitable marker 
DNA and purified as elaborated above (Section 9.2.9.2) using the QIAquick gel 
extraction kit. 
9.2.9.5 Ligation 
The restriction digestion a nd gel elution of both the sbm PCR product and the shuttle 
vector was followed by the ligation of the two restri cted products in order to 
incorporate the sbm gene into the vector which in tu rn will be used to transfer the 
sbm gene in to B. cereus  SPV. The ligation reaction mi x comprised 0.5µL- vector 
(1µg) (following restriction di gestion and gel purification), 7µL- insert (1µg) (here, 
the PCR amplified and gel purified sbm gene following restriction digestion) 1µL of 
the ligation buffer (provided with the T4  DNA ligase) and 1.5µL of T4 DNA ligase 
(NEB, UK) thus making the total reacti on volume up to 10µL/tube. A control 
ligation reaction was carried out using sterile water inst ead of the insert DNA and 
incubated along with the above reaction at 4oC overnight.  
9.2.9.6 Transformation of E. coli  DH5α and B. subtilis  1604 with pCHMC05 sbm 
(pCHMC05 plasmid with the sbm insert) 
Electrocompetent E. coli  DH5α and B. subtilis  1604 (prepared using the protocol 
used for that of E. coli  DH5α) cells were transformed by electroporation (Section 
9.2.8.2.2) with the ligation mix. The water co ntrol ligation mix was used as the 
control sample and the ligation reaction mix with the insert was used as the test 
during the electroporation. Followi ng overnight incubation at 37oC on LB agar 
plates with the suitable antib iotic (100µg/mL ampicillin for E. coli  and 5µg/mL 
chloramphenicol for Bacillus subtilis  1604), all the putative transformants  from the 
test plates were inoculated into 10mL of fresh LB broth with the appropriate 
antibiotic and incubated at the same conditi ons as the plates and were shaken at 
200rpm. It was noted that the control plates (with water in place of the insert during 
ligation) had no growth at all. Following overnight growth, 1-2m L of the culture was 
used to prepare glycerol deeps and stored at -80oC while the rest of culture was 
subject to the routine plasmid isolation a nd purification method in order to check for Materials and methods 
 178the presence of the desired insert. B. subtilis 1604 was used for the transformation in 
order to produce plasmid DNA suitable for transformation into B. cereus  SPV as this 
would enhance the chances of  successful cloning of the sbm gene into B. cereus  SPV 
9.2.9.7 Insert release 
The plasmid isolated from  successfully transformed E. coli  DH5α and B. subtilis  
1604 cells were subjected to another set restriction digestion reactions (Section 
9.2.9.4). The digested samples were run on a 0.8% agarose gel (w ith a suitable DNA 
ladder) alongside uncut plasmid to observe  the release of the appropriate sized 
insert.  
9.2.9.8 Protoplast preparation and polyethy leneglycol (PEG) induced transformation 
of B. cereus  SPV cells 
Protoplasts of B. cereus  SPV cells were prepared and transformed with the shuttle 
vector- sbm insert complex by following the method described by Pragai (1994). 
Transformants were observed af ter 48 hours of incubation at 30oC. The colonies 
obtained were then transferred to LB br oth with chloramphenicol (20µg/mL final 
concentration) and incubated at 30oC and 200rpm.   
9.2.9.9 Colony PCR of transformed B. cereus  SPV cells 
The transformed protoplasts were allowed to  regenerate in LB in the presence of 
chloramphenicol. The cells were then used  for plasmid purification and the plasmid 
DNA was used in PCR amplification with the primers specific for sbm gene. The 
amplification conditions used were the same as that used for earlier reactions (Table 
9.3). The PCR product was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel with a suitable marker DNA.
