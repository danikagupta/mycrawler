Reproduced from Wielinski et al.1:
The bubbling bed type pilot FBR consists of an incineration unit (heater,  reactor, 
sludge feed) and an off gas unit (heat  exchanger, two electrostatic precipitators 
(ESPs), ash bin). A mass flow controller (red-y, Voegtlin, Switzerland) was used to 
adjust the gas flow between 50 and . The incoming  air was heated by a 200 𝐿𝑛/𝑚𝑖𝑛
15 kW electric resistance  heater  (LE 10000 DF-R HT, Leister, Switzerland)  and 
passed the windbox and a distributor plate (d = 10 cm) with 120 evenly distributed  
holes (d = 1 mm).  The pressure  in the windbox beneath the distributor  plate was 
approximately 1.45 kPa above  atmospheric pressure. The sand bed (h = 5 cm, w = 
0.7 kg, 630 > dsand > 800 µm) above  the distributor plate was fluidized at bubbling 
bed type conventional fluidization conditions 2, 3. The bed was composed of Geldart 
group B solids  4, 5 with a theoretical minimal  fluidization  occurring  at a 0.9 kPa 
pressure drop 2. Typical operation conditions were  and air 𝑇𝑠𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑏𝑒𝑑≈820 ‒840 °𝐶
flow  leading to a fluidization  with a dimensionless gas velocity ≈120 𝐿𝑛/𝑚𝑖𝑛
 and a dimensionless particle diameter  (conventional  fluidization 𝑢∗=0.38 𝑑∗=11.75
conditions) 2. Under  typical bed loadings  the pressure  above  the sand  bed was 
approximately 0.35 kPa above  atmospheric  pressure, thus a pressure drop of 1.1 
kPa occurs. Dried  sludge was continuously fed via a spiral conveyor at rates of 0.8 
kg/h. The reactor (or freeboard) temperature fluctuated between  400 and 800 °C, 
depending on the sludge load in the fluidized bed. The reactor  pressure  was held 
constant at -1.6 kPa by a draught fan at the end of the off gas unit. A lambda  sensor 
monitored residual oxygen concentrations and CO equivalents  (COe)  at the upper  
end of the reactor column. Residual  oxygen  concentration  depended on the fuel load 
in the bed and typically  varied  between 12% and 16%. COe was usually below 100 
ppm, depending on the temperature  in the sand bed and reactor.  Higher 
temperatures in the sand bed and the reactor  lead to lower values of COe. A heat 
exchanger, installed at the upper end of the reactor reduced the off gas temperature 
to 110 °C. The off gas was further  fed into the first of two identical  electrostatic 
precipitators (ESPs) (OekoTube-Inside, Oekosolve, Switzerland). A flexible 
resistance heater  was wrapped  around each ESP to keep  the temperature above  the 
dew point. Particles passing the ESP units were collected in a filter bag (FB) at the 
end of the off gas stream. After  an experiment,  the ESP units were agitated and the 
particles collected from the ash bin.3Tables

1The primary particle size of CeO 2-s1 was determined from 91 measurements, that of CeO 2-s2 from 30 measurements. 
2The particle size in the spiking dispersion  was determined by laser diffraction analyses (Beckman Coulter LS 13 320).  The particle  size for CeO 2-s1 was below the lower  size limit 
of the instrument (0.4 µm).
3The particle size in the spiking dispersion  was additionally determined using particle sizer plugin in ImageJ6 on HAADF images. 537 aggregates  were analyzed for CeO 2-s1 and 
55 for CeO 2-s2.

mass in g, c is the concentration in µg g-1. Concentrations represent the average values from three replicate measurements.  The ash 
content of the sludge was determined by combusting  100 mg of sample in a muffle oven.  The oven was heated to 900°C at a heating  
rate of 10 K min-1 and then kept at that temperature  for 1 h. For total carbon  (TC) determination, 1-15 mg of sample (depending  on the 
expected carbon content) were weighed into tin capsules,  amended with vanadium  oxide catalyst and determined using a Euro  EA 
CHNSO Elemental  analyzer (HEKAtech  GmbH,  Germany).  The system was calibrated using  Acetanilide and a reference  soil was 
measured additionally for quality assurance. The burn-off  in the FA was calculated as . Ash %𝑏𝑢𝑟𝑛 ‒𝑜𝑓𝑓 𝐹𝐴 = 100 ‒(%𝑇𝐶 𝐹𝐴

(ICP) optical emission spectrometry except for Ce, which  was determined  using  ICP mass 
spectrometry. The same digests were  used for both analyses.  Recoveries for the different 
elements were between  79% (Ca) and 102% (Al) for NIST SRM 2782  Industrial sludge.11
