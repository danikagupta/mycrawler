Abstract:  Plastics , micro -, and nanoplastics are widely distributed in the environment; soil, fresh , and 
aquatic water sources pose a great challenge to human health and well -being due to improper disposal, 
slow degradation , lack of effecti ve recycling,  and poor management.  Contaminations associated with 
plastics and plastic products are more prevalent worldwide . To overcome the biohazards of plastics, an 
alternative to plastics is warranted. Bioplastics are a good replacement for synthetic plastic polymers. 
Several microbes are explored for bioplastic production , and genetic engineering techniques are used 
to modify the isolate to produce more PHA. To overcome the production cost involved in bioplastic 
production , cheap household wastes are extensively used to make a variety of p olyhydroxyalkonates  
(PHA) based bioplastics. PHA and p olyhydroxy butyrates (PHB) form a part of biomaterials that finds 
extensive biomedical applications , including t issue repair , regenerati ve medicine , wound healing, 
cartilage regeneration, artificial blood vessels, heart valves , and nerve conduits. I t is also used in organ 
reconstruction , including scaffold making, bone implant, i mplant coatings , and sheath making . It also 
finds application  in drug delivery, cancer treatment , and stem cell engineering. Most of the applications 
required in -depth in vivo studies to be used for human health care applications.

1. Introduction  
Huge manufacturing costs hamper the large -scale production of PHA  compared to 
synthetic plastics. Ca rbon sources and fermentation processes together contribute to the cost of 
PHA.  Hence , identifying  less expensive  carbon sources, such as agr icultural and  industrial 
wastes, minimizes  the PHA manufacturing cost and is a commercially viable option [1] . 
Currently , the major challenge is the PHA production cost from fossil -based polymers. For 
large  scale production of PHAs requires sugar -rich substrates and pure or recombinant bacterial 
strains, which contribute to increased  production cost [2]. Hence, looking for cheaper 
alternatives as feedstock for bacterial strains to produce quality PHAs with high yield s is the 
current priority for the res earchers.  Using domestic waste as a feedstock for PHA production 
is advantageous  for the effective management and disposal of waste generated . It is an 
environmental ly friendly process that is also helpful in controlling  environmental pollution.

 The blende d forms of PHA , including PHB  and polyhydroxy butyrate -valerate (PHBV) 
are biodegradable, durable , thermostable, possess required strength, and are also toxic -free. 
PHA -based polymers are used in  packaging materials for food storage, as hydrating agents an d 
as additive for animal nutrients . The multifold use of PHA polymers in the medical field would 
certainly replace the presently used synthetic polymer -based materials.  
2. PHA from Household Waste 
The g eneration of household waste has increased immensely w orldwide. Food waste 
from kitchens, restaurants, cafeterias , and the processing industry is the primary source of 
waste. It contains mostly rice, cocked meats, boiled vegetables, refined fruits, bakery  items , 
and other dairy -based products. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that 1.3 
billion tons of food products are wasted annually, including  fruits, raw vegetables, dairy -based  
products, bakery  items , and animal meat [3]. FAO and WRAP have taken a lot of ini tiatives 
for the effective use and re use of food waste in the recent past [4]. Food waste consist s of 
proteins, lipids , and carbohydrates -polysaccharides , including starch, cellulose, 
hemicelluloses , organic acids, polymers , and inorganic molecules [5]. Fermentable  sugars are 
released from food waste by microorganisms, which serve as microbial feed for the synthesis 
of PHAs. Several products include  biopolymers, nanocomposite  materials , chitosan, corrosion 
resistors, enzymes  for industrial use , films, organic acids,  artificial pigments, silica, and 
biofuels like bioethanol, biobutanol, biodiesel , and biogas are produced by using PHAs as a 
cheap carbon source [6]. Pre -treatment is essential to ease hydrolysis and mak e food waste 
accessible to enzymatic degradation to increase PHA production. The a ppropriate pre-
treatment method is essential depending on the fermentation broth , and bacterial strain used 
[7]. Simple pre -treatment methods such as acid hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation are often  
sufficient for household  food wastes [8]. The chemical pre -treatment method is more 
advantageous for increased PHA production among the physical, chemical, and biological 
methods .   
3. PHA Production from Fruits and Vegetable Wastes  
Fruits and vegetable wastes served as  good carbon source s for PHA production [9, 10] . 
Recently Zobellela tiwanensis  strain DD5 convert ed banana peels into PHB production [11]. 
H. mediterranei  DSM1411 utilizes date waste for PHBV production [12]. PHA is produced by 
Pichia kudriavzevii  using banana p eels as a carbon source and hydrolysates of the chicken 
feather as a nitrogen source  [13]. Bacillus halotolerans  produced 83% of PHA using 
pomegranate peels  compared to Cupriavidus necator  produced 71% of PHA [14]. The mcl-
PHA is synthesi zed by fermentatio n process from waste frying oil by using P. resinovorans  
[15] and PHB production by C. necator  [16]. PHA is also produc ed by Pseudomonas 
alcaligenes  using food waste oil and simultaneous energy recovery [17] . Waste cooking oil or 
fish oil is also used as a cheap carbon source for producing  PHB using Cupriavidus necator 
H16 [18].   
4. Spent Coffee Grounds (SCGs)  
Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are also used as a cheap carbon source for producing  
PHA. Researchers use  SCG hydrolysates to produce PHA by B. cepacia  [19]. H alophile strain 
Halomonas is used to produce PHA from SCG hydrolysates after the chemical  pre-treat process https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS124. 174  
 https://nanobioletters.com/  3 of 14 
 [20].  It has been reported that the synthesis of PHA, biopolymer precursors, and polymer 
composite production from valori zed SCGs [21]. PHA is also synthesized from municipal 
organic solid waste (OFMSW) [22]. Recently PHBV was produced from wheat starch 
wastewater (WSW) using ( B. cereus ) [23]. 
Burkholderia sp. F24 is used for producing PHA from  sugarcane bagasse [24]. Sugar 
cane bagasse, maize cob, teff straw, and banana peel are used to produce PHB using Bacillus 
spp. [25]). PHA is also produced from rice husk by alkali treatment followed by enzyme 
hydrolysis with the help of Burkholderia cepacian USM  [26]. PHB production from pineapple 
waste using C. necator A-04 has already been reported [27]. H. mediterranei is also used to 
produce industrial -scale PHA from cheese whey [28]. 
5. Production of PHB from Chicken Feather  
Chicken feather  is used as a substrate  for the bacteria to produce PHBs. Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa   (NCBI accession MF18889) isolated from t he chicken (feather) waste disposal site 
in Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, India , produced  4.8 g/L of PHB under optimized conditions using 
chicken feather waste  (15.96 g/L ), at 37 °C temperature, and 6.85pH [29]. 
6. Other Cheap carbon sources for PHA production  
Mannose, maltose, sucrose, pre-treated agri cultural and i ndustrial effluents (dairy, 
paper mill, sugarcane molasses ),  pineapple juice,  cane molasses, glycero l waste,  sugarcane 
bagasse, rice husks and corn cobs, date seeds oil, vegetable oil, sunflower oil, beer brewery 
wastewater containing maltose,  cheese whey,  teff straw, banana peel,  discarded egg yolk 
biodiesel liquid waste (BLW), fructose and avocado oil, apple peel, pineapple peel, mango 
peel, waste paper hydrolysate, sugarcane vinasse and molasses, corn bran, wheat bran, rice 
bran, dairy waste B, rubber seed oil, waste cooking oil,  tuna condensate wa ste from the canning 
industry and cassava peel waste are used as cheap carbon sources for PHA production [30] .

 PHA is also produced from various oils , including used cooking oil,  wastewater with 
ground oil, soy oil, coconut oil, olive oil distillate, canola oil, palm oil, palm o lein, and linear 
olefins  [31]. Cupriavidus necator  ATCC 17,699 produce d mcl-PHA (90%) using canola oil as 
a substrate [32]. 
Several bacterial species, Alcaligenes latus, Azobacter vinelandii, Bacillus megaterium, 
Cupriavidus necator, Pseudomonas oleovorans , and Escherischia coli ) are used for PHA 
production [33]. Other bacterial species include  Cupriavidus necator, Alcaligenes eutrophus, 
Wautersia eutropha ,  Ralstonia eutropha, Alcaligen es latus, Aeromonas hydrophila, and 
Pseudomonas putida,  uses agro-industrial residues as a car bon source for PHA production . 
Acinetobacter junii  produces 94.3% PHB using rice milling as a substrate [34]. 
PHAs are accumulated as intracellular granules (storage compounds) in microbial cells. 
Several prokaryotes , including halophiles and thermophiles , are known for PHA production 
[35]. The process involved in the microbial production of PHA/PHB is shown in Figure 1.  
Several halophiles have been reported to produce a variety of PHAs, including  Bacillus 
megaterium uyuni  S29, Salinivibrio  sp. M318, Salin ivibrio  sp. TGB10, Yangia sp. ND199,

 https://nanobioletters.com/  5 of 14 
 Synechocystis salina. Among them , Nostoc muscorum produces PHA (69 % yield) under 
phosphorus deficiency  [36].   
8. Applications of PHA  
PHA / PHB are extensively explored for industrial and medical applications. 
Commercially avail able PHAs produced by different companies worldwide and their 
applications  are given in Table 1. Multiple applications of PHAs/ PHBs  and their 
nanocomposites are schematically shown in Figure 2. PHA is used in bone scaffolds, tissue 
engineering , soft tissues , and organ reconstruction. The elasticity and brittleness of the 
biopolymer are control led by blending techniques . Biomedical applications of PHA include 
drug carrier s, bone implants, tissue engineering, tissue scaffolds , and the develop ment  of 
artificial organ constructs. PHA  synthesized from Gram -positive bacterial strains is non -
immunogenic due to  the lack of lipopolysaccharide layer and is medically more biocompatible  
[37]. PHB, PHBV, poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate -co-3-hydroxyvalerate -co-3- hydro xyhexanoate) 
PHBHHx are widely used as bioplastic biomaterials. To control autoimmune diseases , 
PHBHHx was used as an immunosuppressant drug carrier [ 38, 39 ]. PHBV composite material 
is used for bone regenerati on, and moreover, it is biocompatible with blo od tissue. PHBV is 
also used in tissue engineering for the adhesion, attachment, and growth of fibroblast s [39, 40 ]. 
PHB fib ers are used to manufacture biocompatible sutures (Phantom FiberTM), surgical mesh 
(TornierV), and scaffold (BioFiberTM) marketed by  Tornier Co. Braun Surgical Co. also 
manufactures sutures (MonoMaxR), Tepha Inc (TephaFLEX) [ 41] and Galatea Corp. 
manufactures GalaFLEX mesh [ 41].

Figure 2. Applications of bioplastics (PHA/PHB) and its nanocomposites.  
8.1. Soft t issue repair and regenerative medicine . 
PHAs are used for  soft tissue engineering and the fabricati on of tissue and bone 
scaffolds. Making bioactive glasses (BGs) and introducing other inorganic chemicals  are in 
progress to increase the bioactivity of PHA. [ 42]. PHAs are used for tissue regeneration due to 
their biostability, mechanical characteristics , and minimal tissue -associated hazards [ 43]. 
PHAs a ttach  to cells , cause no hindrance to cell proliferation , and possess the required 
mechanical strength for the regeneration of the tissues [ 44]. Scaffolds created using PHAs serve  
as biomimetics, imitating the targeted tissue a nd encouraging  cell growth and differentiation 
[45]. PHAs used in tissue regeneration and c ell line cultivation for tissue culture have not 
shown any toxicity after human implantation  [46]. Biomaterial scaffolds prepared with 
collagen, chitosan, hyaluronic  acid, gelatin, alginate, agarose , and fibrin  are used along with 
PHA for repairing spinal cord injury [ 47]. 
8.2. PHA and Wound healing . 
Natural  polymers such as collagen, chitosan, fucoidan, hyaluronic acid , and synthetic 
polymers (polyurethanes and Teflo n) are used for the artificial dressing of wounds [ 48]. 
https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS124. 174  
 https://nanobioletters.com/  7 of 14 
 Engineered nanostructures were used to create an antibiotic cover over the wound and inhibit 
the biofilm formation by the pathogenic bacteria , thereby improving the wound healing process  
[48]. The PHA -based biopolymer improves wound -healing , reduces inflammation, and 
increases  skin angiogenesis [ 45]. Pathogens degrade the PHA shells loaded with biocides are 
destroyed themselves [ 47]. 
8.3. Bone tissue engineering . 
Reconstruction of new bone in  bone tissue engineering with the help of natural or 
synthetic mechanical support (PHB as a bone scaffold) increases cell growth [ 48]. Enhanced 
compressibility and elasticity were achieved by mixing with hydroxyapatite (HAP) , and 
hydrogel - PHB supports ost eoblast feedback [ 49]. Porous and biodegradable scaffolds are 
produced by using PHA and HA mixture for the regeneration of bone matrix [50]. 
Piezoelectrical scaffolds  are made by b lending mineralized CaCO 3 with PHBV , and the 
resultant biocomposite film also offers biodegradability and bone regeneration  [51]. 
8.4. Regeneration of articular cartilage . 
Biopolymer scaffolds, PHB , and poly(3 -hydroxyoctanoate) (P 3HO) have been used to 
repair bone cartilage and decrease the risk of secondary osteoarthritis growth.  It is achieved by 
mixing these polymers in different combinations by controlling certain mechanical properties 
and ultra -structure [ 52]. Cartilage tissue engineering by PHB/chitosan scaffolds with the 
addition of alumina nanowires (3%) showed enhanced com pressibility [ 53]. 
8.5. Liver tissue engineering . 
Poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate -3-hydroxyvalerate -co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) PHBVHHx and 
de-cellulari sed liver scaffolds are the two recently developed scaffolds for liver tissue 
engineering. To mimic the natural extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycans, laminin, type I 
collagen , and fibronectin are added in exact proportions to maintain the diversity of growth 
factors, oxygen suppl y, and cell nourishment  are not affected  when blood vessels are ke pt intact  
[54]. 
8.6. Cartilage tissue repairing . 
The scaffold  developed by mixing PHAs, poly (3 -hydroxyoctanoate) and poly (3 -
hydroxybutyrate), is  very effective for cartilage repair. Making scaffolds by the 
copolymerization method has been reported to be effective in increasing the melting 
temperature of PHAs [ 55]. Mixing poly (3 -hydroxybutyrate) and poly (E -caprolactone) with 
silica is used to construct 3D scaffolds from electrospun fibers. The resultant scaffolds possess 
increased strength and stiffness without any e ffect on attachment and cell viability [ 56]. 
8.7. Blood vessels and heart valves . 
P3HB4HB is extensively used to construct  blood vessels due to its elasticity and elastin 
formation [ 46]. In an experimental sheep model , the pulmonary artery was inserted wit h aortic 
valves,  PHBHHx -coated hybrid valves. PHBHHx coating increase s Young’s modulus and 
tensile strength and also reduc es the calcification process. This hybrid valve resembles the 
original valve  and is used as a replace ment for the original valve tissu e [57]. https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS124. 174  
 https://nanobioletters.com/  8 of 14 
 8.8. Nerve conduits . 
In the past , many biological and chemical agents a re used for nerve regeneration. A 
nerve conduit made up of PHB coated with chitosan is used to carry human bone marrow 
Mesenchymal stem cells to repair nerve injury in animal studies  [58]. PHA -graft -graphene  
biomaterial  is also used to prepare nerve conduits, implant s, and biosensors due to its high 
electrical conductivity [ 59] and low crit ical filing content [ 60]. A hybrid nanocomposite -based 
electrochemical biosensor PHA/AuNPs/ HRP/ITO is used to detect  artemisinin in body fluids 
[61]. 
8.9. Drug carriers . 
PHA -derived engineered nanoparticles, microcapsules, and microspheres were 
developed for medical applications [ 63]. MCL -PHA amphiphilic copolymer is used for drug 
delivery [ 62]. Desired hydrophobicity, porosity, and crystallinity of SCL -PHA make them ve ry 
specific as drug carrier s and the release of drugs without affecting the  carrier [ 141]. PHA -based  
nanoparticles and microbeads are used as drug (therapeutic agents) carriers [ 64]. Gentamicin 
sulfate, simvastatin , and ciprofloxacin are delivered by using PHA -based drug carriers [ 45].  
8.10. Antibiotics delivery and Biodegradable PHA  rods. 
Polymers of PHA are extensively used for the encapsulation and delivery of antibiotics. 
Antibiotics rifampicin and tetracycline are delivered by using PHA microspheres. This drug 
release rate  can be controlled by polymer crystallinity ; at higher polymer crystallinity, the 
release rate is lower [ 65]. Antibiotics -loaded PHA rods are used to treat osteomyelitis [ 47]. 
8.11. Organ reconstruction . 
PGA  non-woven fibers are used to replace the d og esophagus, and keratinocytes and 
fibroblasts are seeded in  the prostheses and used in situ. The esophageal substitution of 
prosthesis has led to muscular membrane development [ 66]. Poly  (3HB -co-3HV) and 
poly(3HB) are used to repair and reconstruct the urethra. D ogs' urethra is also  substituted by 
entwined laces o f poly  (3HB) coated with PHBV [ 67]. P3HB is safe for urethra replacement  
and used in the reconstruction and repair of tissues in  experimental animals [ 68]. 
8.12. Bone tissue engineering . 
Due to its vascularity and degradability , PHA can be used in making b one scaffolds 
[69]. By introducing hydroxyapatite (HA) , osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity can be 
incorporated into a bone scaffold. Studies using MC3T3 - E1 mouse pre -osteoblast cells showed 
that PHB/HA porous blends are stable  and biocompatible with c ell adhesion and proliferation 
for bone tissue regeneration [ 70]. Different agents of varied atomic sizes were used to adjust 
the porosity and the interconnectivity between the particles in scaffolds by solvent -casting 
particulate leaching (SCPL) technique  [71]. Fabricating PHA -PEG scaffolds using sodium 
chloride and PEG as porogen 's using SCPL results in PHA -PEG scaffold s with homogeneous 
pore size s of 378 –435µm with increased water retention and absorptivity[ 71]. Nanofibrils 
obtained from electrospinning possess sufficient porosity, structural stability, compatibility, 
and matching with the targeted tissue. Electrospun fibers are similar to  cellular a rchitecture  and https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS124. 174  
 https://nanobioletters.com/  9 of 14 
 can regulate  the infiltration and viability of cells [ 72]. Biomaterials such as PHAs, cellulose, 
chitin, HA, PEG, PLA, etc. , have been explored for  mouse cranium  bone regeneration [ 73]. 
8.13. PHA -based i mplants and implant coatings . 
PHAs are bio -compatible and tissue -compatible , used in various implants , and reported 
to trigger cell proliferation and growth. It is non -carcinogenic when used in bioimplants and 
scaffolds [ 46]. The oligomeric and monomeric forms of biodegradable products derived from 
PHA are non-toxic  to cells and tissues. The PHB -based pericardial scaffold was used 
successful ly in sheep as  a tissue implant [ 74]. 
9. PHA Nanocomposites  
PHB/OMMT (organically modified montmorillonite) nanocomposites are used for 
bone tissue engineering due to their porosity, non-immunogenic property , and 
biocompatibility. It is also used for 3D organ bioprinting and lab -on-a-chip scaffold 
engineering applications [75]. PHB/CNCs (cellulose nanocrystals) nanocomposites find 
application in medical and packaging industries. The pr oduction cost of PHB/CNCs is less due 
to CNCs from cheap natural resources. Presence CNCs increase their biodegradability when 
used for packaging. PLA/PHB/CNCs containing carvacrol are used for packaging [76] . It also 
showed better disintegration within 17  days during composting. PHB/CNCs nanocomposites 
are often prepared with plasticizers for  biodegradable packaging material. PHB/CNCs 
nanocomposites a re also used as paperboard coatings, which increases mechanical strength and 
protects  from moisture [77]. In vitro studies showed that PHB/CNCs nanocomposites are safe 
without toxicity for human applications. The possibility of using  PHB/CNCs nanocomposites 
in drug or fertilizer encapsulation is also viable [78].  
10. Conclusion s and Future Prospectives   
Many bacterial species produce PHAs/ PHB s; recently , researchers have reported  the 
production of PHA/PHB by submerged fermentation of Paraburkholderia sp. PFN 29  [79]. 
PHA,  its homopolymers , and copolymers are extensively used in industry and the medical field. 
PHA biopolymer is used for tissue engineering (scaffolds for tissue/ organ reconstruction and 
substitutes bone tissue) and regeneration, drug delivery, plasmid DNA delivery , and 
chemotherapeutics due to its high biocompatibility, bioactiv ity, and versatility. PHA is also 
used in biosensors and electronics as well. PHA -based nanomaterial would be used as a 
packaging agent for hormones, drugs, and antibiotics. High PHA -yielding and fast -growing 
microbes need to be identified under optimi zed cultural conditions. The properties and quality 
of PHA are improved to make it a suitable biocomposite material for biomimicking and to 
replace its synthetic counterparts. PHA, PHB , and PHBHHx would be the ideal candidate for 
next-generation bioplastics to  replace synthetic petroleum -based polymers to reduce pollution 
and improve the ecosystem and human health.
