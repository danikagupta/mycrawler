The fresh water diatom Nitzschia palea was cultured
in four different culture media viz., f/2, Walne’s, Chu
and WC to determine the quality and production oflipids and fatty acids in this diatom duringexponential and stationary phases of growth. Thelipid content showed significant variation betweenculture media i.e. 10.97, 13.98, 25.43 and 21.43% inthe exponential phase and 19.09, 21.41, 19.29 and18.54% in the stationary phase in f/2, Walne’s, Chuand WC medium, respectively. The lipid fraction ofN. palea  was mainly composed of myristic acid
(11.76 -19.8%), pentadecanoic acid (7.76 - 18.18%),palmitic acid (3.0 - 15.1%), palmitoleic acid (3 -15.1%), arachidonic acid (5.03 - 21.61%) andeicosapentaenoic acid (2.61 - 19.86%) . Saturated fatty
acids (SFAs) production was found to increase fromexponential to stationary phase in all the culturemedia studied. Monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFAs) were found to decrease in percentage fromexponential to stationary phase in f/2 and Walne’smedium whereas in Chu and WC medium MUFAsshowed an increase in percentage in the stationaryphase. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)showed a decrease in quantity as the culture enteredstationary phase. The results revealed that theculture medium and the growth phase affect thequantity of fatty acids considerably and the percent-age of fatty acids in each medium and growth phaseare significantly different (p<0.5).

Introduction
Microalgal lipids have been used as a dietary sourcefor metabolic energy and essential components forgrowth of animals in aquaculture, with the fatty acidcontent and composition being the central factor inthe selection of microalgal species, as this regulatesthe productivity of the cultured species (Renaud etal., 1999). Thus, microalgae especially diatoms area critical component of the aquaculture food chainmainly for live feeds for larval culture (Brown et al.,1997). Many of the strains successfully used forbivalves are also used as direct feed for crustaceans(especially shrimp) during the early larval stages,such as Skeletonema sp. and Chaetoceros sp. Benthic
diatoms such as Navicula sp. and Nitzschia sp. are
commonly mass-cultured and then settled ontoplates as a diet for grazing juvenile abalone (Brown,2002). The PUFAs especially EPA derived fromdiatoms determine the quality, survival, growth andresistance to disease of cultured animal species(Gouveia et al., 2008).
Microalgae are very efficient in metabolizing CO
2,
with almost zero level of energy, to highly energeticmetabolites including oil which is the feedstock ofbiodiesel (Spolaore et al., 2006). Approximately 46
tons of oil per hectare per year can be producedfrom diatoms which can accumulate lipid equiva-lently or to a greater extent than other algal speciessuch as Botryococcus braunii, Nannochloropsis  sp.,
Neochloris oleoabundans  etc. which produce up to

Diatoms can rapidly induce triacylglycerol undersilicate limitation, avoiding the detrimental effectson photosynthesis, gene expression and proteincontent associated with N limitation (Hildebrand etal., 2012).
The fuel quality of biodiesel (i.e., cetane number,
exhaust emission, heat of combustion, cold flow,oxidative stability, viscosity, and lubricity) dependson the characteristics of the individual fatty acidalkyl esters, which are mainly determined by thestructural features of the fatty acids (Knothe, 2005).
The fatty acid profile of diatoms indicates their
application in different fields like live feeds inaquaculture and biofuel production. The polyun-saturated fatty acids (PUFA) are essential factors forthe growth and survival of larvae and post larvaeof fishes, crustaceans and mollusks, or indirectly asfood for the live prey (Brown, 2002; Daume et al.,2003 and Gouda et al., 2006).
The lipid and fatty acid profile of microalgae vary
in accordance with culture conditions viz. culturemedium (Lincymol et al., 2012; Martinez- Cordovaet al., 2012; Suman et al., 2012; Abdel- Hamid et al.,
2013; Naseera et al., 2013; Krishnan et al., 2016;
Menezes et al., 2016; Mitani et al., 2017; Lidiya &Joseph, 2018 and Lidiya et al., 2018), temperature(Rousch et al., 2003; Araujo &Garcia, 2005 and Wahet al., 2015), light intensity (Khoeyi et al., 2012 andWahidin et al., 2013), photoperiod (Khoeyi et al.,2012; Wahidin et al., 2013 and George et al., 2014),nutrient stress (El- Kassas, 2013; Chagoya et al.,2014; Jiang et al., 2015; Ganga & Joseph, 2016 andGanga et al., 2016), harvesting technique (Borges etal., 2016) and growth phase (Liang & Mai, 2005;Pratiwi et al., 2009; Costard et al., 2012; Lidiya &Joseph, 2018 and Lidiya et al., 2018). There is paucityin information regarding the impact of differentculture media and growth phase on the lipidproduction and fatty acid profile of N. palea . So, the
present study was aimed to evaluate the effect ofgrowth media and growth phase on the qualitativeand quantitative production of fatty acids in the
fresh water diatom N. palea with respect to live feed
and biodiesel potential.
Materials and Methods
N. palea  was collected from freshwater sources like
stream and paddy fields. Collection was done byscratching the pebbles and rocks collected from thestream using a brush (Taylor, 2007). Later N. palea
was isolated from the collected sample by twomethods viz., serial dilution and agar plating
(Andersen, 2005). The stock culture of N. palea was
maintained in f/2 medium. The structure, size andmorphology of N. palea  were studied using light
microscope. Scanning electron microscope studywas carried out for further taxonomic confirmationusing the identification key for diatoms (Heurck,1896).
N. palea  was cultured in 1L Erlenmeyer flasks filled
with filtered and sterilized fresh water supple-mented with desired culture medium. Four mediasuch as f/2 (Guillard, 1975),  Walne’s (Walne, 1966),
Chu (Chu, 1942) and WC (Guillard & Lorenzen,
1972) were selected for the study. The cultures wereexposed to 25°C temperature and 1500 lux light ona 12h: 12h light: dark cycle (Andersen, 2005). 10%volume of the total culture medium with a celldensity of 10 x 10
4 cells/ ml was used as inoculum
(Vicose et al., 2012). Growth kinetics was studied bycalculating the cell density on alternate days ofculture. The cell density was enumerated followingthe method described by (Andersen, 2005) using theformula ie.,
Cell density = Total number of cells in 5 columns
x 5 x 10
4 cells/ ml
Preliminary studies on growth kinetics revealed that
N. palea  entered into the exponential phase on the
5th day and it lasted to the 15th day with a maximum
cell density of 45 x 104 cells/ ml (10 days period).
The culture entered into the stationary phase on the16
th day and lasted to the 20th day (5 days period).
So the culture was harvested during the exponentialand stationary phase by centrifugation at 8000 rpmfor 20 min in 500 ml centrifuge tubes.
The sample pellet obtained by centrifugation was
dried and then lipid extraction was done usingchloroform: methanol (1:2) according to the methodof Bligh &Dyer (1959). To 1g sample 5ml chloro-form: methanol was added and then homogenizedthoroughly. Later 5 ml chloroform and 5 ml distilledwater were added to the homogenized sample.  Thesample was shaken well and kept at 4°C overnight.
Later the sample was transferred to a separatingfunnel and the lower chloroform layer containinglipid was collected through Na
2SO4. Then lipid was
concentrated at 45°C in a rotary vacuum ev aporator.
The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was preparedby the method suggested by Metcalfe et al., 1966.Culture Medium and Growth Phase Modulate the Fatty Acid Composition of the Diatom 29
© 2020 Society of Fisheries T echnologists (India)  Fishery Technology  57 : 28-35The lipid was refluxed with methanolic NaOH at
80ºC for 25 min under nitrogen atmosphere. Later5ml BF
3 methanol was added to the sample and
refluxed again for 5 min. After cooling the sample,it was transferred to a separating funnel and 5 mlsaturated NaCl was added. The solution was shakenwell and lower impure layer was removed. Later thesample containing FAME was washed thrice usingpetroleum ether and distilled water. Then thepetroleum ether layer was collected through Na
2SO4
and concentrated in rotary vacuum evaporator at40ºC. The FAME thus obtained was then recollectedin minimum amount of petroleum ether.
Gas Chromatographic analysis was done on a
Perkin-Elmer Clarius 580 Gas chromatograph (HP5890 Series II, Perkin Elmer, Bridgeport Ave,Shelton, CT, USA) connected with Optima 225(crossbond 5% diphenyl- 95% dimethyl polsiloxane)capillary column (100 m X 0.25 mm i.d., 0.50 ìm filmthickness, Supelco, Bellfonte, PA). The flame ioniza-tion detector (FID) equipped with a split injector,was used in the split (1:15) mode. The GLC analyseswere accomplished using an oven, injector anddetector which were held at a temperature of 110°C,
275°C and 280°C, respectively. Nitrogen was usedas the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25 cm/s. Hydrogenwas used as the ignition gas at a head pressure of20 psi. The fatty acid peaks were identified bycomparison of retention times with the knownstandards (SupelcoTM 37 Component FAME Mix,Catalog No. 47885-U).
The experiments were carried out in triplicate and
the results were expressed as mean ± standarddeviation. SPSS version 22 was used for analysis.The data were compared using one way ANOVAwith Duncan’s post hoc tests. ‘p’ values of <0.05 wereused as standard for statistical significance.
Results and Discussion
The production of lipids and fatty acids by diatomsin response to nutrients and growth phase isspecific. The present study focused on the fatty acidproduction in N. palea  when cultured in different
culture media and harvested during differentgrowth phases.Table 1. Percentage of fatty acids in Nitzschia palea  cultured in four culture media

© 2020 Society of Fisheries T echnologists (India)  Fishery Technology  57 : 28-35N. palea had a lipid content of 10.97, 13.98, 25.43 and
21.43% when cultured in f/2, Walne’s, Chu and WCmedium, respectively in the exponential phase ofgrowth. In the stationary phase N. palea had a lipid
content of 19.09, 21.41, 19.29 and 18.54% whencultured in f/2, Walne’s, Chu and WC medium,respectively (Krishnan et al., 2016). Statistical analy-sis revealed that there is significant difference (P<0.05)in lipid content in the four culture media during bothexponential phase as well as stationary phase.
The major fatty acids found in N. palea  are shown
in Table 1. The results of the present study revealedthat the fatty acid composition of N. palea  can vary
significantly(p<0.05) in response to the culturemedium. The result is in accordance with the resultspublished by Opute (1974) who cultured thediatoms Nitzschia palea, Navicula muralis  and Nav-
icula inserta  in Chu medium and Abdel-Hamid et al .
(2013) in which fatty acid production of Nitzschia
palea  cultured in NAV medium is reported. Exten-
sive studies indicated that diatom lipids are mostlycomposed of myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid,palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, arachidonic acid andeicosapentaenoic acid (Opute, 1974; Liang & Mai,2005; Chen et al., 2007). Other fatty acids namely,stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, lignocericacid (SFAs), oleic acid, erucic acid (MUFAs) linoleicacid and linolenic acid exhibited minor quantitativecontribution to fatty acid composition.
When N. palea  was cultured in f/2 medium, MUFAs
were found dominating among the total fatty acidcontent in the exponential phase. Supporting resultswere reported by Liang & Mai (2005) in Chaetoceros
gracilis, Cylindrotheca fusiformis, Phaeodactylumtricornutum, and  Nitzschia closterium  and Renaud et
al. (1999) in Nitschia  sp. who showed that MUFA
content was higher compared to SFAs and PUFAs.Similarly, Lidiya et al. (2018) reported that Tetraselmis
gracilis  when grown in different culture media viz.
f/2, Walne’s, Chu and WC, maximum MUFAproduction was obtained in f/2 medium. As acontrast to these results, Gordon et al . (2006)
reported that Nitzschia laevis, Amphora luciae and
Navicula lenzii  produce comparatively higher amount
of PUFAs than other groups of fatty acids in f/2medium in the exponential phase. In the presentstudy, in case of stationary phase N. palea  produced
more SFAs compared to MUFAs and PUFAs in f/2 medium. This finding is reminiscent of the resultsby Knuckey et al. (2002) in the diatom Atheya
septentrionalis.In case of Walne’s medium, PUFAs were found
dominating in the exponential phase. The studiesdone by Lidiya et al. (2018) in Tetraselmis gracilis
revealed a similar result with the production ofmaximum PUFA in Walne’s medium. In contrast to
this, Umamaheswararao et al. (2015) in Thalassiosira
pseudonana  found out the production of higher
concentration of SFAs in the exponential phase. Butin case of stationary phase, N. palea  had a higher
concentration of SFAs in Walne’s medium. Thisresult is in corroboration with the work ofUmamahesw ararao et al. (2015).
N. palea  when cultured in Chu medium, SFAs were
found dominating in the exponential phase. But thestudies done by Opute (1974) showed an increasedproduction of MUFAs in this phase. In the presentstudy, when N. palea  was analyzed for fatty acids in
the stationary phase a higher concentration of SFAswas found as in the exponential phase.
A higher percentage of PUFAs and SFAs were found
in the exponential phase and stationary phase of N.
palea , respectively when cultured in WC medium.
These results are in contrast to the findings ofCalixto et al. (2016) who found out the productionof more SFAs in Chlamydomonas  sp., and MUFAs in
Lagerheimia longiseta  and Pediastrum tetras  which
were cultured in WC medium and harvested in theexponential phase. However, the present observa-tions contradict with the results reported byMenezes et al. (2016) which showed an increasedproduction of MUFAs in Choricystis minor  in the
stationary phase.
As discussed already, N. palea  when cultured in f/
2 medium and Walne’s medium, more lipid produc-tion was found during exponential phase but whengrown in Chu and WC medium more lipidproduction took place in the stationary phase.Similarly, fatty acid composition also varies with thechange in growth phase (Pratiwi et al., 2009; Costardet al., 2012; Lidiya et al. 2018).
During the exponential phase of growth N. palea  was
found to produce maximum saturated fatty acidswhen cultured in the Chu medium. There wassignificant difference (p<0.05) between the percent-age of saturated fatty acids produced in all theculture media. Monounsaturated fatty acid produc-tion was highest in f/2 medium and there wassignificant difference (p<0.05) between the percent-age of monounsaturated fatty acids produced in allthe culture media.

fatty acids produced in f/2 and Walne’s medium. Butthere was no significant difference (p>0.05) betweenthe percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acidsproduced in WC and Chu medium (Fig. 1).
saturated fatty acids showed a general tendency to
decrease as the culture aged.
During N. palea harvested in the exponential and
stationary phases of growth it was found out thatsaturated fatty acids tend to increase when enterinto the stationary phase of growth in all the culturemedia. The observation is in accordance with theearlier findings of Pratiwi et al. (2009) in Chaetoceros
gracilis  who found that saturated fatty acids increase
in quantity in the stationary phase of culture. In caseof monounsaturated fatty acids there found adecrease in production in the stationary phasecompared to exponential in f/2 and Walne’s me-dium. This correlates with the results obtained inChaetoceros gracilis  by Pratiwi et al. (2009). But in
Chu and WC medium monounsaturated fatty acidsshowed an increase in the stationary phase ofgrowth. Monounsaturated fatty acid percentage wasfound to increase from exponential to stationaryphase in the study done in Chaetoceros gracilis,
Cylindrotheca fusiformis, Phaeodactylum tricornutum,and Nitzschia closterium by Liang & Mai (2005).
Polyunsaturated fatty acids showed a generaltendency to decrease as the culture aged.Nannochloropsis oculata contained more PUFA per
cell in logarithmic phase than in stationary phase(Dunstan et al., 1993). Increases in the relativeproportions of both saturated and monounsaturatedfatty acids and decreases in the proportion of PUFAswere associated with growth phase transition fromthe exponential to the stationary phase. Liang &Mai(2005) justified this through their study on the effectof growth phase on the fatty acid compositions ofdiatoms. According to them neutral lipids frommicroalgae are mainly composed of saturated andmonounsaturated fatty acids while polar lipids areFig. 1. Fatty acid composition of Nitzschia palea  during
the exponential phase of growth
Highest production of saturated fatty acids instationary phase was obtained when N. palea was
cultured in the Walne’s medium. There was no
significant difference (p>0.05) between the percent-age of saturated fatty acids produced in Walne’s andWC medium. But f/2 and Chu media showedsignificant difference (p<0.05) between them. Amongthe four culture media an elevation inmonounsaturated fatty acid production was foundin f/2 medium. MUFA production in all the culturemedia showed significant difference (p<0.05). Incase of polyunsaturated fatty acids N. palea pro-
duced more of them when cultured in Walne’smedium. PUFA production in N. palea when
cultured in all the culture media showed significantdifference (p<0.05) (Fig. 2).
The growth phase of the diatom also influences the
fatty acid production. When N. palea  was harvested
during the exponential and stationary phases ofgrowth and analyzed for fatty acid composition itwas found out that saturated fatty acids tend toincrease when enter into the stationary phase ofgrowth in all the culture media. In case ofmonounsaturated fatty acids there found a decreasein production from exponential to stationary phasein f/2 and Walne’s medium. But in Chu and WCmedium monounsaturated fatty acids showed anincrease in the stationary phase of growth. Polyun-

to be storage lipids for algae while polar lipids areassociated with the photosynthetic membranes ofalgae. Hence, decrease in production of PUFAs inthe stationary phase can be in relation with thereduction in photosynthesis in this phase.
The present observations revealed that saturated
fatty acids as well as unsaturated fatty acids evenlycontribute to the fatty acid composition of N. palea .
The fatty acid composition of microalgae determinesthe purpose of their utilization. N. palea  produced
more PUFA in the exponential phase compared tothe stationary phase, which indicates that thisdiatom can be used as a live feed during itsexponential phase. It is found to produce amaximum of 19.86% EPA in its exponential phaseof growth. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acidsin particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) anddocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are necessary for thegrowth, development, metamorphosis and reducedmortality of aquatic animals during the larval stage.
Microalgal lipids are also being targeted as a
feedstock for the sustainable production of biodiesel.Algae generally produce a lot of polyunsaturates,which may present a stability problem since higherlevels of polyunsaturated fatty acids tend todecrease the stability of biodiesel. Basha &Jebaraj(2009) reported that the long chain fatty acids withcarbon atoms number between C12 and C24represent suitable feedstock for biodiesel. Evaluat-ing the results of the present study N. palea  is found
to produce more saturated fatty acids in comparisonto polyunsaturated fatty acids and while enteringinto the stationary phase the percentage of saturatedfatty acids tend to increase. According to the studiesconducted by Abdel- Hamid et al. (2013), N. palea
may be suitable feedstock for biodiesel. Hence, N.
palea  can be considered as a good competitor in the
field of biodiesel production.
Nitzschia palea  is an abundant species of diatom in
the natural environment and it can be culturedeasily under laboratory conditions. A standard
protocol for the culture of N. palea  under laboratory
conditions has been developed. The fatty acidprofiling of N. palea  revealed its significance in the
field of aquaculture and biofuel production. Hence,being rich in major fatty acids this diatom can becultured in mass to satisfy the needs for microalgaeas live feeds and a source of biodiesel.Acknowledgements
