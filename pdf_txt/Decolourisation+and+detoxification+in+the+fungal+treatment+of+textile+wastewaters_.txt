Abstract: In this study a selected  fungal strain, Bjerkandera adusta (Willdenow) P. Karsten MUT 3060, 
was tested in different culture conditions in order to assess its real potential for bioremediation of 
textile wastewaters in terms of both decolourisation and detoxification. The fungus e fficiently 
decolourised (colour removal up to 96%) four simulated wastewaters that mimic the recalcitrance of 
real ones for pH values, concentration of dyes, additives and salts. In the culture condition with the 
lowest N content, the decolourisation was c oupled with an important detoxification of two simulated 
effluents, underlining the important influence of the cultural medium composition not only on the 
degradation but also on the detoxification of industrial wastes. In the other cases, despite an exten sive 
decolourisation, no detoxification was observed. The fungus was further tested against a real effluent, 
collected from a wastewater treatment plant before and after the tertiary treatment (ozonation) in 
order to compare the two technologies in terms o f chemical and toxicological parameters. The fungal 
treatment, although less efficient than ozonation, caused a good decolourisation of the effluent, with 
colour values within the threshold limits of the Italian law; both the fungal and the ozone treatment  
caused a detoxification, but only towards one of the three organisms used for the ecotoxicological tests. 
These results underline the critical importance of the ecotoxicological analysis in assessing the 
applicability of a wastewater treatment.

 Cover LetterAnswer to reviewers  
 
We thank you for your review, comments and suggestions. We would like to respond with the 
following:  
 
Reviewer 1  
 
1) Material and methods. The hydrolysation protocol, the individual dyes concentrations and 
all the information concerning t he real wastewater were added. We also propose to add the 
absorbance spectrum of the real effluent before and after fungal/ozone treatment (Figure 5). 
In case Figures were too many, Figure 2 could be omitted. We explained in more detail the 
calculation of the decolourisation percentage.  
2) Results. Table 1 was divided in two: Table 1 with enzymatic activities and Table 2 with 
ecotoxicity tests. We inserted the standard deviations or the confidence limits for the data 
presented. As we explained in Material and Methods, the toxicological ( V. fischeri  and P. 
subcapitata ) and COD analysis of the real effluent were conducted at ARPA Piemonte (the 
Italian environmental protection agency) that, in accordance with its internal procedures, 
does not provide confidence li mits when the sample is within the terms of the law. However, 
in our opinion, there still seems appropriate to present the data because they highlight a 
trend of increased toxicity following both treatments.  
3) All the Figures were improved according to the r eviewer comments.  
4) A better comparison between the present results and other articles was added.  
 
Reviewer 2  
 
i) The title was modified in “Decolourisation and detoxification in the fungal treatment of 
textile wastewaters from dyeing processes”.  
ii) The introducti on was modified according to the reviewer suggestions. Four reviews 
were cited and new comments were added on the choice of enzymatic assays and of the 
organisms for eco -toxicity analysis.  
iii) Material and methods were modified according to the given indicatio ns. 
iv) As explained in Material and Methods, the eco -toxicological tests were conducted on 
samples and on non -toxic controls containing water ( C. sativus ) or nutritional/diluent 
solutions ( P. subcapitata /V. fischeri ). Control data are included in the formulae  used for 
toxicity calculation and hence, the measures of toxicity before and after fungal treatment 
are all relative data that take into account the growth of the organism in the test samples 
compared to the non -toxic controls. The absolute measurement of  growth in the controls 
(data not shown) has no meaning in itself, but merely serves as a reference for the data 
obtained on the toxic samples and as proof of the validity of the test. Similarly, the 
control datum for the DP is included in the calculation of the percentage of color 
removal compared to the abiotic control, as explained in Material and Methods. We 
added in the text information of DP values observed in killed samples.  
v) As regard to the enzymes analysis, we performed activity assays in order to investigate 
the production of peroxidases and laccase that, according to literature, are considered the 
main involved enzymes in dyes degradation by fungi. The measure of high levels of 
activity of a specific enzyme, together with the removal of a pollutan t, is considered 
indicative of a relation between the detected enzyme and the degradation. We added a 
comment on this correlation in the text. However, as we stated, “f urther studies are 
necessary in order to identify more precisely these enzymes and to cl arify their role in 
the decolourisation process”.  We removed the term “isoform” and corrected with 
“enzymatic pattern” and, as we have no explanation of the assertion “ It could be *Detailed Response to Reviewersassumed that the initial adsorption step ... dye degradation”, we removed it . In the 
introduction we added, as an explanation of the choice, that the organisms used for 
ecotoxicity tests showed a good or high sensitivity to the toxicity of textile wastewaters 
(Tigini et al., 2011).  
vi) Figure caption 2 was corrected and figures were m odified as suggested.  
vii) We corrected English throughout the text according to the reviewer suggestions.   1 Decolourisation and detoxification in the fungal treatment of textile wastewaters from dyeing

Introduction  
Increasing industrial development and urbanisation have resulted in generation of large 
quantities of toxic and per sistent pollutants in watercourses that cause deleterious ecological effects 
and pose a serious threat to animals and humankind [1]. Considering both the volume and the 
composition of the effluents,  the textile industry is rated as the most polluting among  all industrial 
sectors. Textile effluents are one of the most difficult -to-treat wastewaters on account of the 
considerable amount of suspended solids and of the massive presence of dyes, salts, additives,  3 detergents and surfactants [2]. The physical -chem ical technologies for wastewater treatment, 
including the advanced oxidation processes (i.e. application of ozone, hydrogen peroxide and 
ultraviolet), are expensive, not always effective, and often do not reduce the toxicity of the effluents 
[3].  
In recen t years, many studies on innovative biological approaches have investigated  the 
possibility to use selected microorganisms to degrade dyes in wastewaters. Fungi, particularly white 
rot fungi, have long been recognised for their ability to degrade a wide ra nge of recalcitrant 
compounds, such as synthetic dyes, through the use of relatively non -specific, extracellular 
oxidative enzymes [4, 5]. This extracellular enzymatic system, which in nature is involved in lignin 
degradation, consists mainly of oxidative enzymes like laccases (Lac), lignin peroxidases (LiP) and 
manganese peroxidases (MnP) that have been demonstrated effective against a wide range of 
industrial dyes [6].  
However, fungal treatments have not yet found  a real application, mainly due to the di fficulty 
in selecting organisms able to grow and remain active in the very variable and harsh  conditions of 
wastewaters [7]. In fact, fungi should be able to live with the scarce nutrient resources present in the 
effluents, to win the competition with the autochthonous microflora and to survive in presence of 
high concentrations of salts, dyes, detergents and heavy metals. Moreover, the requirement of low 
pH values (4 -5), optimum enzyme activity, and long hydraulic retention times for complete 
decolourisati on are other concerns in fungal treatments application [8].   
Another important and often underestimated aspect is the reduction of toxicity at the end of 
the process that is a prerequisite to hypothesize a real application in the treatment of coloured 
wastewaters [7] . Actually, biodegradation does not imply that the resulting metabolites are less 
toxic than the parent molecules [9] and chemical procedures alone cannot provide sufficient 
information on the potential harmful effects of pollutants on the aquat ic ecosystem. This can be 
done only by means of bioassays [10, 11, 12].   4 Different organisms have been standardized for ecotoxicity evaluation and the most suitable  
test organism should be selected  taking into account the characteristics of the wastewaters  (i.e. 
colour, turbidity) and of the receiving stream  [13]. Since different species do not respond identically 
to the same pollutant and show  varying sensitivity, a realistic representation of an ecosystem using a 
single organism is not achievable. The app lication of a battery of tests with organisms of different 
trophic level is always recommended for toxicity monitoring of wastewaters [13, 14].  
In a previous study [7], the important influence  of culture conditions on the efficiency of 
wastewater decolour isation and detoxification by a strain of Bjerkandera adusta  (Willdenow) P. 
Karsten (MUT 2295) was highlighted. In this study a similar optimisation  process  was carried out 
on another strain of B. adusta  (MUT 3060), which was effective in wastewater treatm ent by means 
of a different enzymatic pattern [data not shown]. In this way, it was also possible to investigate the 
eventual intraspecific variability of different strains of B. adusta  in the decolourisation and 
detoxification of effluents. The wastewater s toxicity, before and after treatment, was analysed, in 
deeper detail than in the previous study [7], by means of an ecotoxicity tests battery using three 
organisms belonging to different trophic levels that showed a good or high sensitivity to the toxici ty 
of textile wastewaters [15 ]. Finally, the fungus was tested against a real wastewater to assess its 
potential for bioremediation in terms of both decolourisation and detoxification.  
Materials and Methods  
Simulated and real textile effluents  
Four simulat ed wastewaters, developed by the industrial partners of the EC FP6 Project 
SOPHIED (NMP2 -CT-2004 -505899), were designed to mime effluent recalcitrance for pH, 
concentration of dyes, additives and salts produced during wool (W1), cotton (W2, W3), and leathe r 
(W4) dyeing processes and were used under the permission of the SOPHIED Consortium. W1 
(pH5) contained 100 ppm of each of the acid dyes AY49, AR266 and Abu62, and 2000 ppm of 
Na2SO 4. W2 (pH 10) contained 1250 ppm of each of the reactive dyes RY145, RR195 , Rbu222 and 
Rbk5, and 70000 ppm of Na 2SO 4; since reactive dyes enter textile effluents after thermal hydrolysis  5 of reactive groups occurring in dyeing -bath conditions, the dyes were previously hydrolyzed by a 4 
h treatment at 95°C in a NaOH (10 g/l) solut ion. W3 (pH9) contained 1000 ppm of each of the 
direct dyes DrY106, DrR80, and DrBu71, and 5000 ppm of NaCl . W4 (pH5) contained 100 ppm of 
each of the acid dyes ABk194, Abk210 and AY194. The industrial dyes were kindly provided by 
Town End (Leeds, UK) plc.  and all the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO USA).  The simulated wastewaters were sterilised by tyndalization (three 1h cycles at 60 
°C with 24 h interval between cycles at room temperature) before use.  
The real wastewater was kindly provided by EURO D srl (BG, Italy ), a company that treats 
about 4500 m3 per day of effluents mainly coming from cotton, polyester and polyamide dyeing 
processes, through a primary (chemico -physical), secondary (activated sludge) and tertiary pro cess 
(ozonation). The effluent for fungal treatment experiments was sampled after the secondary 
treatment (WR pre O 3) and had the following features: pH 8.5, COD 145 mg/l, chlorides 780 mg/l, 
sulfates 200 mg/l.  In addition, a sample of wastewater was colle cted after the tertiary treatment 
(WR post O 3) in order to compare the effects of the fungal treatment and the ozonation  in relation 
to chemical and ecotoxicological parameters.  
Organism  
The strain tested in this study, B. adusta  MUT 3060, is preserved at the Mycotheca 
Universitatis Taurinensis  Collection (MUT, University of Turin, Department of Plant Biology) on 
Malt Extract Agar (MEA) at 4°C. The strain was selected in a previous study because of its efficient 
decolourisation activity against different dy e classes and against W1 -4, in the absence of any 
additional nutrient source [7]. 
Decolourisation experiments  
In order to evaluate the effect of different culture conditions on the W1 -4 decolourisation, 
the fungal treatment was carried out in presence and in absence of glucose and yeast extract as 
described below. The fungus was inoculated as five agar plugs (5 mm of diameter), taken from the 
edge of an actively growing colony on MEA, in 100 ml flasks containing 30 ml of a high nitrogen  6 content medium as pr eviously described [7]. The flasks were incubated in agitated conditions (130 
rpm) at 28°C. After 7 days, the culture broths were replaced with 30 ml of the four simulated 
wastewaters in presence and in absence of nutrients: 10 g l-1 glucose and 3.18 g l-1 of yeast extract 
(GHY); 10 g l-1 glucose and 0.15 g l-1 of yeast extract (GLY). Since the very restrictive conditions 
of W2 hindered the growth and activity of the fungus [7], a dilution of this wastewater to 1/3 and 
1/5 was necessary. Heat -killed control s (obtained by autoclaving cultures before adding the dye) 
and abiotic controls (without fungal inoculum) were included. Each trial was performed in 
triplicate.  
In the real wastewater experiment, the inoculum consisted in ten fungal plugs added, as 
descri bed above, in 500 ml flasks containing 200 ml of GHY. After 7 days, the mycelium was 
recovered, homogenized using Ultra -Turrax (Ika, Germany),  and inoculated (2.5 ml) in 200 ml 
flasks containing 100 ml of GHY. After 7 days, the culture broths were replaced  with 100 ml of the 
real wastewater WR pre O 3 in presence of glucose and yeast extract in the proportion of GLY 1/10 
(1 g l-1 glucose  and 0.015 g l-1 of yeast extract).  
Daily, 1 ml of wastewater from each sample was taken, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min 
to remove disturbing mycelial fragments, and examined with a spectrophotometer (TECAN Infinite 
M200, Austria) to acquire the absorbance spectrum from 360 nm to 790 nm and to monitor the 
enzymatic activities as described in the following paragraphs. Sin ce a linear relationship subsisted 
between the area of absorbance spectrum and dye concentration, the percentage of removed dye 
(decolourisation percentage, DP) was calculated (software Magellan V 6.5, TECAN, Austria) as the 
extent of decrease of the spect rum area of the treated effluent, with respect to that of the abiotic 
control . Significance of differences (P≤0.05) among DP values at the end of the experiment was 
calculated by the Mann -Whitney test (SYSTAT 10, SPSS inc. 2000).  
Enzymes assays and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  
Laccase (Lac) activity was assayed at 25°C, following the oxidation at 420 nm  of 2.2’ -
azinobis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS ), in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer pH 3  [16].  7 Manganese -independent (MiP) and man ganese -dependent (MnP) peroxidase activities were 
measured at 25°C, following the oxidation at 590 nm  of 3-dimethylaminobenzoic acid/3 -methyl -2-
benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride (DMAB/MBTH ), in 0.1 M succinate lactate buffer pH 
4.5 [17]. For MnP, 2 5 µM MnSO 4 were added to the mixture.  Lignin peroxidase (LiP) activity was 
assayed at 35°C, following the oxidation at 310 nm  of veratryl alcohol, in 0.1 M sodium tartrate 
buffer pH 3.0  [18]. All the enzyme activities were expressed as International Units (IU), where 1 
unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidizes 1 mole of substrate per minute.  
The liquid cultures, concentrated by Amicon ultracentrifugal filters with 10000 Da cut off 
(Millipore, USA), were subjected to  non-denaturing polyacrylamid e gel electrophoresis (PAGE) 
according to the method of Laemmli [19], with the omission of sodium dodecyl sulfate and -
mercaptoethanol. The gels were loaded with 0.03 IU per well and, a fter separation, were directly 
immersed in a solution containing 0.1 M  sodium citrate buffer pH 3  and 2 mM ABTS for laccase 
activity and in the same solution, with the addition of 100 M H 2O2, for peroxidase activity.  
Ecotoxicity tests and COD determination  
Toxicity of the simulated wastewaters was evaluated, before and af ter the fungal treatment, 
by means of a battery of three tests. The phytotoxicity test on Cucumis sativus  L. seeds was set up 
according to the method UNICHIM N. 1651 (2003). The germination index (GI%) was calculated 
according to the formula: GI% = (Gs·Ls) /Gc·Lc)·100, where Gs is the mean number of germinated 
seeds in the sample, Ls is the mean root length of the sample, Gc is the mean number of germinated 
seeds in the control (made of distilled water), Lc is the mean root length of the control.  
The inhibit ion of cellular growth of the green unicellular alga Pseudokirchneriella 
subcapitata  (Korshilov) Hindak was performed according to the method UNI EN ISO 8692:2005. 
The results were  expressed as percentage of inhibition of the algal growth (I%) comparing th e 
treated samples with a control made up by nutrient solution only.  
The test on Vibrio fischeri  was set up according to the method UNI EN ISO 11348 -3:2001. 
The luminescence of the bacteria in the treated samples, measured by Microtox (Microtox Model  8 500; M icrobics Corp., USA) after 15 min exposure at 15°C, was compared to that of a non -toxic 
control made of the Microtox diluent solution only . Correction for colour, which might have an 
impact on the luminescent measurements, was performed on all samples acco rding to the 
MicrotoxOmni manual. Toxicity was expressed as the effective concentration that inhibits the 
bacterial growth by  50% (EC 50), and as its  inverse (Toxicological Units, TU 50). Thanks to the 
reduced amount of material necessary for this test (abou t 5 ml of composite sample from 3 
repetitions), it was possible to conduct this analysis not only at the beginning and at the end of the 
treatment, but also at an intermediate time (7 days).  
Determination of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) with the dichro mate method was 
performed before and after treatment (IV cycle) of WR pre O 3 effluent using HACH (COD High 
range vials) apparatus (HACH LANGE, S.r.l. Milan, Italy) according to the manufacture’s 
instructions. A calibration curve was obtained using HACH COD  standard solution (800 mg l-1 of 
O2). Appropriate dilutions of each sample were assayed.  
All data were expressed as average (  conf. 95%) . The V. fischeri , P. subcapitata and COD 
analysis of the real effluent were conducted by ARPA Piemonte that, in accor dance with its internal 
procedures, does not provide confidence limits when the sample is within the threshold limit of the 
Italian law (Legislative Decree 152/2006).  
Results and discussion  
B. adusta  MUT 3060 has proved to be  a strong and versatile organi sm, able to grow in very 
variable and harsh conditions (pH from 5 to 10, salts up to 70 g l-1 and 13 different dyes up to a 
concentration of 5000 ppm). The fungus resulted very effective in the decolourisation  of different 
wastewaters (up to 96% of DP , Tab le 1).  As already described by other authors [20, 21], a two -steps 
degrading process was observed during W1 -4 decolourisation: an initial rapid decolourisation step , 
due to the adsorption of the dyes on the mycelium that resulted visibly coloured, was foll owed by 
an effective degradation step, highlighted by the complete knock down of the absorption spectra 
(Figure 1) and by the resulting colourless biomasses. This phenomenon was  confirmed by killed  9 samples analysis : within the first hours, they caused a ra pid reduction of the spectra as well (about 
30% of DP);  however, unlike living biomasses, they remained strongly coloured until the end of the 
experiment, in the absence of any degradation activity (Figure 2).  
Different  culture conditions resulted essenti al for the process optimisation, as already 
observed on another strain of B. adusta  against the same simulated wastewaters [7] and on 
Pleurotus ostreatus  against W1 [22]. The addition of GLY strongly improved the decolourisation 
efficiency (DP values alway s higher than 90%, Table 1). The influence of the medium composition 
was particularly evident towards W2 1/5 (DP from 36 to 91%) and W3 ( DP from 50 to 90% ), 
indicating that the higher the wastewater recalcitrance, the more stringent the conditions for the 
growth and activity of the fungus become.   
As regard to the enzymes produced during the decolourisation process, MnP and MiP 
activities were mainly detected, as generally reported in literature for this species [7, 23, 24], while 
Lac and LiP activities wer e almost absent or negligible (<5 U/l) (Table 1). No enzyme activity was 
detected in killed and abiotic controls. A good correlation was often observed between the main 
enzymatic activity, MnP, and DP as can be seen for example in the case of W4 GLY (Figur e 3). The 
positive correlation between ligninolytic enzymes and decolourisation, as already observed by other 
authors [5], shows that these enzymes play a key role in the biodegradation of synthetic dyes and 
textile effluents though little is known about t heir combined role and interactions [25]. This is 
mainly due to the high complexity of the biodegradation mechanisms involved, where in addition to 
the ligninolytic enzymes, other biochemical systems may influence the rate of the bioremediation 
process, na mely cytochrome P450 mono -oxygenase system, hydroxyl radicals and the level of H 2O2 
produced by the fungi [26]. However, the measure of high levels of activity of a specific enzyme, 
together with the removal of a pollutant, could be considered indicative o f a relation between the 
detected enzyme and the degradation [26].  
The MiP activity could indicate the involvement of different enzymes, including versatile 
peroxidase (VP), a new family of ligninolytic peroxidases with intermediate features between MnP  10 and LiP [27], or Dye -decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) [28]. Recently, DyP and VP were purified and 
characterized in B. adusta  [29, 30]. However, the precise identification of these peroxidases and a 
clear distinction in classes are still complex because, as rec ently reviewed by Hofrichter [31], they 
belong to a very heterogeneous family, including enzymes with similar, partially overlapping, 
biochemical features.  
Interestingly, as already described in other studies on this species [7, 23, 24], we also 
observed that the peroxidase production  is greatly influenced by the environmental conditions ( i.e. 
N content, wastewater composition, pH, etc.) [4] and that  a higher enzyme activity does not always 
lead to a more efficient decolourisation, as in the case of W3 GLY  and GHY (Table 1). This last 
aspect  could be partly explained considering the pH values measured during the experiments and 
the important role of pH  for the functioning of the enzymes , as already observed by other authors 
[32]. The best DPs were  often ach ieved when the fungal metabolism caused a variation of pH to 
values around 5 -6 (optimum  for peroxidases). Another possible explanation could be the production, 
in different culture conditions, of enzymes with different affinity for dyes. In fact, this stra in 
produced a different enzymatic pattern according to the wastewater (composition and dilution) and 
the cultural condition, as shown, for example, by the native PAGE on MiP activities produced on 
GLY, in presence and in absence of the different wastewater s (Figure 4). Further studies are 
necessary in order to identify more precisely these enzymes and to clarify their role in the 
decolourisation process.  
Since decolourisation does not imply that the molecules resulting from the degradation 
process  are less toxic than the parent ones [9], after the fungal treatment we monitored the toxicity 
of the wastewaters using  two organisms ( C. sativus and P. subcapitata) . In presence of the lowest N 
content (GLY), the most efficient decolourisation was also coupled with  an important detoxification 
of two effluents: W1 towards  both organisms ( P. subcapitata also in the other culture conditions), 
W2 1/3 towards  P. subcapitata and W2 1/5  towards  C. sativus (Table 2). In the case of W1 GLY, it 
is important to note that the f ungal treatment led to a detoxification within the threshold limit values  11 of the Italian law ( GI% > 50 and I% < 50  - Legislative Decree 152/2006). This result underlines the 
important influence of the cultural medium composition not only on the degradation  but also on the 
detoxification of industrial wastewaters . On the contrary, despite a great decolourisation of W3 and 
W4, no detoxification was obtained; indeed, an increased toxicity was often observed (Table 2). 
Concerning the test on V. fischeri , the to xicity measurement at mid -treatment provided  a 
significant additional information. For all the tested samples, a marked increase of toxicity was 
noted during the first week. Then, in most cases the toxicity did not change or even decreased 
during the secon d week (Figure 3). This trend could be explained assuming that at the beginning B. 
adusta  MUT 3060 breaks the chromophore structure causing the loss of colour; afterwards it goes 
on degrading the secondary products which could be more toxic than the dye it self. This hypothesis 
is supported by the enzymatic activity that remained at high levels even after the complete 
decolourisation of the wastewater, as can be seen for example in the case of W4 GLY (Figure 3).  
The colour of the real wastewater WR pre O3 wa s reduced by 63% and 40% through 
ozonation (WR post O3) and fungal treatment, respectively (Table 2, Figure 5 ). Even if with a 
lower yield than ozone, the treatment with B. adusta  MUT 3060 determined a good decolourisation, 
within the Italian threshold lim it (Legislative Decree 152/2006, colour not visible after 1/20 
dilution). From an applicative point of view, it is interesting to consider the duration of the fungal 
treatment, which resulted very rapid for a biological process (24 hours). In order to expl oit the 
potential of decolourisation of both processes, a combined ozonation/fungal treatment may be 
performed, as also suggested by Vanhulle and collaborators (2008).  
The COD value after fungal treatment resulted slightly above the threshold limit value f or 
wastewater discharge (160 mg/l COD, Legislative Decree 152/2006), probably in consequence of 
the culture medium addition. The ecotoxicity tests showed different results according to the 
organism tested (Table 2). Only the fungal treatment led to a compl ete detoxification towards  C. 
sativus  (GI% = 99.8), while an increased toxicity against V. fischeri  and P. subcapitata  was 
observed after both treatments; however, the values were still within the legal threshold limit,  12 except for P. subcapitata  that resul ted completely inhibited (I% = 100) after fungal treatment. It 
should be noted that, in addition to the toxicity of metabolites produced by the fungus, the strong 
inhibition of algal growth may depend on the lower pH values observed after fungal treatment;  
actually, P. subcapitata  requires pH values around 8 -8.5 for optimal growth. In the light of this, 
further analysis should be carried out to evaluate the contribution of pH to algal toxicity and, 
eventually, to identify toxic metabolites.  
The results of the present  study underline, in compliance with increasingly stringent 
environmental regulations, the importance of extensive ecotoxicological analysis to assess the 
applicability of a wastewater treatment process. This is true also when different strains of the same 
fungal species are used, as can be observed when we compare the results of this study with those 
obtained by the other strain of B. adusta  [7]: the two strains showed a similar decolourisation 
efficiency, but a different capacity of detoxificat ion towards the same simulated effluents probably 
in consequence of the different enzymatic pattern.  
Our data clearly indicate that not only in the biological process through B. adusta , but also 
in the ozonation  process, an effective decolourisation is oft en not coupled with a reduction of 
toxicity. In this context, it is important the use of organisms belonging to different trophic levels in 
order to achieve a more complete toxicological analysis. However, the difficulty of interpreting the 
often conflicti ng results of different tests, stresses the need to identify in the near future the most 
appropriate assays for different types of wastewaters; as demonstrated by recent studies [15], the 
seaweed P. subcapitata  seems to be the most sensitive and therefore most suitable organism for 
textile wastewaters.  
In conclusion, this work has shown  that it is relatively easy to optimize the fungal 
decolourisation process, i.e. by means of media engineering, but not the detoxification. Further 
investigations are needed to understand in more detail  the fungal metabolism involved in the 
degradation and to optimize the process on both sides: decolourisation and detoxification. One of 
the strategies to exploit the fungal oxidative potential could be to consider a longer trea tment, in  13 order to obtain a higher rate of detoxification, or to intervene with the fungal treatment at an earlier 
stage, for example before the secondary treatment performed with conventional activated sludge.  
When we turn to fungi in natural environments , we find that they are particularly important in the 
breakdown and recycling of the most complex and recalcitrant polymers, such as lignocellulose. 
Such a  strong oxidative capacity could be exploited at the early stages of the wastewater treatment, 
when f ungi could detoxify the effluent degrading molecules toxic and recalcitrant for bacteria, and 
at the same time, reducing a significant part of the COD. Subsequent activated sludge stage could 
be operated to reduce the remaining COD and toxicity .
