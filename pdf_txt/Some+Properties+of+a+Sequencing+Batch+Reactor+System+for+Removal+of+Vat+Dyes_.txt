Abstract
	 The	color	removal	efficiency	of	a	sequencing	 batch	reactor	(SBR)	system	with	synthetic	textile	wastewater	 (STWW)	
containing	 80	mg/L	disperse	dye	increased	with	the	increase	of	mixed	liquor	suspended	 solids	(MLSS)	or	solids	retention	
time	(SRT).	The	color	removal	efficiency	was	over	98%	at	an	MLSS	of	4,000	mg/L	and	SRT	of	over	25	days.	Also,	the	color	
removal	efficiency	decreased	with	the	increase	of	dye	concentration.		 Both	disperse	blue	60	and	disperse	red	60	repressed	the	
growths	and	activities	of	both	heterotrophic	 and	denitrifying	 bacteria,	but	they	did	not	show	any	effect	on	nitrifying	bacteria.	
However,	the	SBR	system	did	not	show	any	change	in	color	removal	efficiency	of	both	disperse	red	60	and	disperse	blue	60.	
The	SBR	system	showed	quite	low	color,	COD	and	BOD5	removal	efficiencies	 with	raw	textile	wastewater	 (TWW).	But,	
the	system	removal	efficiencies	 could	be	increased	by	dilution	of	the	TWW	and	supplementation	 with	glucose.	The	color	
removal	efficiency	of	the	system	with	four	times	diluted-TWW 	containing	 1.875	g/L	glucose	was	69.6±4.0%.	 Moreover,	
contaminated-NaCl	in	STWW 	could	depress	color	adsorption	yields	of	living	as	well	as	dead	bio-sludge.

Abstract
The	aim	of	the	present	study	was	to	standardize	and	to	assess	the	predictive	value	of	the	cytogenetic	analysis
by	Micronucleus	(MN)	test	in	fish	erythrocytes	as	a	biomarker	for	marine	environmental	contamination.	Micronucleus
frequency	baseline	in	erythrocytes	was	evaluated	in	and	genotoxic	potential	of	a	common	chemical	was	determinedin	fish	experimentally	exposed	in	aquarium	under	controlled	conditions.	Fish	( Therapon jaruba )	were	exposed	for	96
hrs	to	a	single	heavy	metal	(mercuric	chloride).	Chromosomal	damage	was	determined	as	micronuclei	frequency	infish	erythrocytes.	Significant	increase	in	MN	frequency	was	observed	in	erythrocytes	of	fish	exposed	to	mercuricchloride.	Concentration	of	0.25	ppm	induced	the	highest	MN	frequency	(2.95	micronucleated	cells/1000	cells	comparedto	1	MNcell/1000	cells	in	control	animals).	The	study	revealed	that	micronucleus	test,	as	an	index	of	cumulativeexposure,	appears	to	be	a	sensitive	model	to	evaluate	genotoxic	compounds	in	fish	under	controlled	conditions.

1. Introduction
In	India,	about	200	tons	of	mercury	and	its
compounds	are	introduced	into	the	environment
annually	as	effluents	from	industries	(Saffi,	1981).Mercuric	chloride	has	been	used	in	agriculture	as	afungicide,	in	medicine	as	a	topical	antiseptic	anddisinfectant,	and	in	chemistry	as	an	intermediate	in
the	production	of	other	mercury	compounds.	The
contamination	of	aquatic	ecosystems	by	heavymetals	and	pesticides	has	gained	increasing	attentionin	recent	decades.	Chronic	exposure	to	andaccumulation	of	these	chemicals	in	aquatic	biotacan	result	in	tissue	burdens	that	produce	adverseeffects	not	only	in	the	directly	exposed	organisms,but	also	in	human	beings.
Fish	provides	a	suitable	model	for	monitoring
aquatic	genotoxicity	and	wastewater	qualitybecause	of	its	ability	to	metabolize	xenobiotics	andaccumulated	pollutants.	A	micronucleus	assay	hasbeen	used	successfully	in	several	species	(De	Flora,et al.,	1993,	Al-Sabti	and	Metcalfe,	1995).	The
micronucleus	(MN)	test	has	been	developedtogether	 with	 DNA-unwinding	 assays	 asperspective	methods	for	mass	monitoring	ofclastogenicity	and	genotoxicity	in	fish	and	mussels(Dailianis et al.,	2003).
The	MN	tests	have	been	successfully	used	as
a	measure	of	genotoxic	stress	in	fish,	under	bothlaboratory	and	field	conditions.	In	2006	Soumendra
et al.,	made	an	attempt	to	detect	genetic	biomarkers
in	two	fish	species,	 Labeo bata andOreochromis
mossambica, by	MN	and	binucleate	(BN)
erythrocytes	in	the	gill	and	kidney	erythrocytes
exposed	to	thermal	power	plant	discharge	atTitagarh	Thermal	Power	Plant,	Kolkata,	India.
The	present	study	was	conducted	to	determine
the	acute	genotoxicity	of	the	heavy	metal	compoundHgCl
2	in	static	systems.	Mercuric	chloride	is	toxic,
solvable	in	water	hence	it	can	penetrate	the	aquaticanimals.Mutagenic	studies	with	native	fish	speciesrepresent	an	important	effort	in	determining	thepotential	effects	of	toxic	agents.	This	study	wascarried	out	to	evaluate	the	use	of	the	micronucleustest	(MN)	for	the	estimation	of	aquatic	pollutionusing	marine	edible	fish	under	lab	conditions.

1.	Introduction	
	 Textile 	wastewater 	contains	not	only	dyestuffs	
but	also	the	organic	substances	 which	impact	the 
environment	 and	aquatic	life	(Chu,	2001;	Department	
of	Industrial	Works,	2002).	The	amount	of	pollutants	
in	the	wastewater	 depends	on	type	of	the	product	and	
production	 process,	especially,	 coloring	and	washing	
steps	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	Hu,	1996;	Wong	and	
Yuen,	1996;	Graca	et al.,	2001;	Department 	of	Industrial	
Works,	2002).	Several	types	of	dyestuffs	such	as	disperse,  
vat,	direct,	acid,	basic	and	reactive	dyes	are	used	in	
the	textile	industry.	Disperse	dyes	are	normally	used	to	
print	or	dye	the	typical	Thai-textile 	products	(cotton	and	
silk).	The	Thai-textile	 factories	normally	belong	to	the	
small	size	factory	group	(home-made	 textile	products)	
(Department 	of	Industrial	Works,	2002;	Hu,	1996;	
Wong	and	Yuen,	1996;	Graca	 et al.,	2002).	Chemical	
treatment	processes	such	as	adsorption,	 precipitation,	
coagulation 	and	chemical	oxidation	are	commonly	
used	to	remove	dyestuffs	from	the	textile	wastewater	
(Janos	 et al.,	2003;	Meshko	 et al.,	2001).	Even	though	
these	chemical	treatment	processes	are	quite	effective	
for	dyestuffs	removal,	but	they	consume	high	energy	
and	chemical	agents.	Chemical	waste	is	also	generated  
from	those	chemical	processes	and	the	effluent	does	not	
meet	the	permitted	effluent	standard	levels	(Department	of	Industrial	works,	1992).	However,	the	dyestuffs	in	
the	textile	wastewater	 are	refractory	 organic	matter  
and	can	be	biodegraded 	or	utilized	as	carbon	and	
energy	sources	for	microorganisms	 (Metcalf	&	Eddy,	
2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	 et al.,	2006;	Yang	 et al.,	2001;	
Kim	 et al.,	2002).	Nowadays,	 several	researchers	 (Fu	
and	Viraraghavan,	 2001;	Fongsatitkul	 et al.,	2004;	
Basibuyuk	 et al.,	2001;	Nigam	 et al.,	1995;	Hu,	1996;	
Bromley-Challenor	 et al.,	2000;	Chen	 et al.,	2003)	have	
been	focusing	on	the	application 	of		biological	treatment	
processes	to	treat	the	textile	wastewater	 due	to	low	cost	
and	absence	of	chemical	wastes	(chemical	sludge).	
Several	research	studies	on	the	biological	 removal	of	
vat	dyes	have	been	reported	in	the	literature	(Nigam	
et al.,	1995;	Kapdan	 et al.,	2000;	Kapdan	 et al.,	2003;	
Nigam	 et al.,	1995;	Lourenco	 et al.,	2001),	but	only	
few	on	the	biological	 removal	of	disperse	dyes	based	
on	their	properties	such	as	water	solubility	and	low	
adsorption	 yield	onto	activated	carbon	(Nilsson	 et al.,	  
2006;	Nigam	 et al.,	1995;	Lourenco	 et al.,	2001).	Nigam	
et al.	(1995)	reported	that	dyestuffs	such	as	azo,	diazo	
and	reactive	dyes	could	be	adsorbed	onto	the	surface	of	
both	dead	and	living	microorganisms.	 Hu	(1996)	also	
reported	that	both	gram	negative	and	gram	positive	
bacterial	cells	showed	an	ability	to	remove	colorants	
or	dyestuffs.	Our	previous	work	revealed	that	not	only	
disperse	dyes	but	also	vat	and	direct	dyes	could	be	37adsorbed	onto	the	bio-sludge	 collected	from	activated	
sludge	systems	(Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Saengow,	2004;	
Sirianuntapiboon et al.,	2007;	Sirianunapiboon 	and	
Srisornsak,	 2007)	and	the	bio-sludge	 age	affects	dye	 
removal	capacity	(both	dye	adsorption	 and	degradation  
capacities)	 (Fu	and	Viraraghavan	 2001;	Hu	1996;  
Zaoyan	et al.,	1992;	Walker	and	Weatherley, 	2000;	
Khehra	 et al.,	2005).	However,	a	few	researches	working  
on	the	application 	of	activated	sludge	system	(AS)	
system	to	treat	textile	wastewater	 have	been	reported.	
Sequencing 	batch	reactor	(SBR)	system	is	a	fill	and	draw	
AS	system	was	designed	resulted	to	omit	to	clarifier	
and	carried	out	the	oxic	and	anoxic	conditions	 in	the	
same	reactor.	Form	above	results,	SBR	system	might	
suitable	for	treatment	the	textile	wastewater.	
	 In	this	study,	the	SBR	system	was	applied	to	treat	
both	synthetic	and	raw	textile	wastewater	 containing	
disperse	dyes	(disperse	blue	60	or/and	disperse	red	60)	
under	various	mixed	liquor	suspended	 solids	(MLSS)	
and	disperse	dye	concentrations. 	The	effect	of	salt	
(NaCl)	concentration	 on	the	dye	removal	efficiency	of	
bio-sludge	 were	also	investigated	 as	were	the	effects	of	
dilution	rates	and	glucose	supplementation	 on	the	SBR	
system	efficiency.
2. Materials and Methods2.1. Dyes	 Two	types	of	disperse	dyes	were	selected	for	use	in	
this	study	viz.,	Disperse	Red	60			(1-Amino-2-phenoxy-

density	at	548	nm)	(Society	of	Dyes	and	Colourists,	
1987)	as	shown	in	Fig.	1.		
2.2. Textile Wastewaters	 Two	types	of	textile	wastewaters, 	raw	textile	
wastewater	 (TWW)	and	synthetic	textile	wastewater	
(STWW)	were	used	in	this	study.	TWW	was	collected	
from	the	influent	sump	tank	of	the	central	wastewater	
treatment	plant	of	a	textile	factory	in	Samutprakarn	
Province,	 Thailand.	 TWW	(the	maximum	 optical  density	of	TWW	was	detected	at	573	nm)	was	taken	
only	once	and	stored	at	4-8
oC	before	using	in	the 
experiment	 to	maintain	the	same	wastewater	 quality.	
The	chemical	properties	of	TWW	are	described	in	Table	
1.	TWW	was	also	diluted	with	distilled	water	at	the	ratio	
of	1:0,	1:1	and	1:2	to	reduce	toxicity	before	being	used	
as	the	influent	of	SBR	system	(Table	1).	The	TWW	and	
diluted-TWW 	solutions	were	supplemented 	with	1.875	
g/L	glucose	to	increase	BOD5	concentration	 as	shown	
in	Table	1	and	also	used	as	the	influent	of	the	SBR	  
system.	STWW	was	prepared	according	to	the	chemical  
properties	of	TWW.	The	STWW	was	composed	of		
glucose	1,875	mg/L,	urea	115	mg/L,	FeCl2	3.5	mg/L,	
NaHCO3	675	mg/L	KH2PO4	55	mg/L,	MgSO4.7H2O	
42.5	mg/L	and	disperse	dyes	(Disperse	blue	60	or/and	
disperse	red	60)	at	80,	160	or	320	mg/L.	The	chemical	
properties	of	STWW 	are	described	in	 Table	1.
 
2.3. Acclimatization of bio-sludge for SBR system 
	 Bio-sludge	 from	the	bio-sludge	 storage	tank	of	the	
central	sewage	treatment	plant	of	Bangkok	Municipality  
(Sripaya	sewage	treatment	plant)	was	used	as	the	
inoculum	of	the	SBR	system.	The	bio-sludge	 was	fed	
with	STWW	without	disperse	dye	in	the	SBR	reactor	
and	acclimatized	 for	1	week	under	HRT	of	5	days	as	
shown	in	Table	2.
2.4. SBR system
 	 Six	10-L	reactors,	made	from	acrylic	plastic	(5	mm	
thick)	as	shown	in	Fig.	2,	were	used	in	the	experiments.	
The	dimensions	 of	each	reactor	were	18cm-diameter	
and	40	cm-height,	 and	the	working	volume	was	7.5	L.	
Low	speed	gear	motor	(model	P	630A-387, 	100V,	50/60	
Hz,	1.7/1.3	A,	Japan	Servo	Co.	Ltd.,	Japan)	was	used	
for	driving	the	paddle-shaped 	impeller.	The	speed	of	the	
impeller	was	adjusted	to	60	rpm	for	complete	mixing.	
One	set	of	air	pump	system,	model	EK-8000,	 6.0	W	
(President	 Co.	Ltd.,	Thailand)	was	used	for	supplying	
air	to	each	set		of	2	reactors	(The	system	had	enough	
oxygen	supply	as	evidenced	 by	the	dissolved	oxygen 
of	the	system	of	about	2-3	mg/L).	The	excess	bio- 
sludge	was	removed	during	draw	and	idle	periods	
to	control	mixed	liquor	suspended	 solids	(MLSS)	of	
the	system	as	mentioned	 in	Table	2	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,

	 1.4	L	acclimatized	 bio-sludge	(10	g/L	as	dry	basic)	
from	section	2.3	was	inoculated	in	each	reactor,	and	the	
TWW	or	STWW	solutions	were	added	(final	volume	
of	7.5	L)	within	1	h.	During	feeding	the	wastewater,	
the	system	had	to	be	fully	aerated	and	the	aeration  
continued	for	19	h.	Aeration	was	then	shut	down	for	3	
h.	After	the	bio-sludge	was	fully	settled,	the	supernatant	
was	removed	within	0.5	h	and	the	system	kept	under	
idle	condition	for	0.5	h	(totally	4	h	for	anoxic	step).		
Then,	fresh	wastewater	 was	filled	into	the	reactor	to	
the	final	volume	of	7.5	L	and	the	above	operation	was	
repeated.	The	operation	parameters	 of	the	SBR	system	
are	described	in	Table	2.	The	experiments	 were	carried	
out	for	12	months	during	January–December	2010.2.6. Preparation of bio-sludge for dye adsorption test 	 Two	types	of	bio-sludge,	 living	(resting)	and	dead	
(autoclaved),	 were	used	in	this	experiment.	 Bio-sludge	
from	the	bio-sludge 	storage	tank	of	Sripaya	sewage	
treatment	plant	was	cultivated	with	STWW	without	
disperse	dye	for	1	week	in	SBR	reactor	under	HRT	of	5	
days	as	shown	in	Table2.	The	cultivated	bio-sludge	was	
harvested	and	three	times	washed	with	0.1	M	phosphate	
buffer	solution	at	pH	6.0.	The	washed	bio-sludge	 was	
used	as	living	bio-sludge.	 Half	of	the	living	bio-sludge	
was	autoclaved	 twice	for	10	min	each	at	110
oC	and	used	
as	the	dead	bio-sludge.2.7. Chemical analysis	 Chemical	 oxygen	demand	(COD),	biological	oxygen  
demand	(BOD

pH	of	influent	and	effluent,	mixed	liquor	suspended	
solids	(MLSS),	sludge	settled	volume	tested	at	30	min.	
(SV30)	and	sludge	volume	index	(SVI)	were	determined	
using	standard	methods	for	the	examination	 of	water	
and	wastewater	 (APHA,	AWWA,	WPCF,	1998).	The	
color	intensity	of	STWW	and	TWW	was	determined 	as	
the	absorbance	 at	the	optimum	wavelength	 as	shown	in 
section	2.1	and	section	2.2	after	centrifugation	 at	6,000	
Xg	for	10	min.	SRT	(solid	retention	time	or	bio-sludge	
age)	was	determined	 as	the	ratio	of	total	MLSS	of	the	
system	to	the	amount	of	excess	bio-sludge	 wasted	a	
day.2.8. Statistical analysis method 	 Each	experiment	 was	repeated	at	least	three	times.	
All	the	data	were	subjected	to	two-way	analysis	of	
variance	(ANOVA)	 using	SAS	Windows	Version	6.12	
(SAS	Institute,	1996).	Statistical	significance 	was	tested	  using	the	least	significant 	difference 	(LSD)	at	the	
p<0.05	level	and	the	results	shown	as	the	mean±the	
standard	deviation.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of MLSS on the SBR system efficiency
	 The	results	on	the	effect	of	various	MLSS  
concentrations 	on	the	removal	efficiencies 	of	the	
SBR	system	are	shown	in	Tables	3-5.	The	COD	and	
BOD
5	removal	efficiencies	 were	over	90%	and	95%,	
respectively	 for	all	conditions	 of	testing	but,	color	and	
TKN	removal	efficiencies	 increased	with	the	increase	
of	MLSS	or	SRT	as	shown	in	Tables	3-5.	Color	and	
TKN	removal	efficiencies	 were	over	98%	and	85%,	
respectively 	at	an	MLSS	of	4,000	mg/L	and	SRT	of	over	 
25	days	as	shown	in	Table	5.	Effluent	NO3-	increased	
while	effluent	TKN	decreased	with	the	increase	of	
MLSS	operation	as	shown	in	Table	4.	The	NH4+ and 
TN	removal	efficiency	decreased	with	the	increase	of	
MLSS	as	shown	in	Table	4.	The	COD,	BOD5,	TKN	and	
dye	removal	efficiencies	 of	SBR	system	with	STWW	
containing 	80	mg/L	disperse	blue	60	were	high	at	
93.3±1.0%, 	97.2±0.5% 	and	98.2±0.5	%,	respectively 	at	
an	MLSS	of	4,000	mg/L	and	HRT	of	5	days	as	shown	
in	Table	3	and	Table	4.	Also,	the	system	showed	high	
COD,	BOD5,	TKN	and	dye	removal	efficiencies 	of	
94.8±0.9%, 	97.0±0.5%, 	83.2±1.8% 	and	99.1±0.2%,	
respectively	 with	STWW	containing	 80	mg/L	disperse	
red	60	at	an	MLSS	of	4,000	mg/L	and	HRT	of	5	days.	
Moreover,	 the	system	did	not	show	any	significant  
difference	 in	the	color	removal	efficiency	 for	both 
disperse	blue	60	and	disperse	red	60.	SVI	of	the	system	
also	increased	with	the	increase	of	MLSS.	However,	
SVI	of	the	SBR	system	was	in	the	range	of	50-90	mL/g	
at	MLSS	of	1,000-3,000 	mg/L	as	shown	in	Table	5.	Also,	
SRT	of	the	system	increased	with	the	increase	of	MLSS.	
SRT	of	the	system	with	STWW	at	an	MLSS	of	3,000	
mg/L	was	about	20	days	as	shown	in	 Table	5.	
	 From	these	results,	the	optimal	operating	of	MLSS	
at	3,	000	mg/L 	was	selected	for	further	experiments.
3.2. Effect of the mixed-disperse dyes concentration on 
the SBR system efficiency  	 The	results	of	the	effects	of	mixed-dispersed	
dyes	(mixture	of	disperse	blue	60	and	disperse	red	60)	
concentration	 on	the	SBR	system	removal	efficiencies	
are	shown	in	Fig.	3	and	Fig.	4.		The	COD,	BOD
5 and 
color	removal	efficiencies 	of	the	system	decreased	with	
the	increase	of	mixed-disperse 	dyes	concentration.

4. Discussion
	 Our	previous	studies	showed	that	both	SBR	and	
granular	activated	carbon-SBR	 systems	could	be	applied  
to	treat	textile	wastewater 	containing 	various	types	
of	dyestuffs	(Sirianuntapiboon 	and	Saengow,	2004;	
Sirianuntapiboon et al.,	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	
Sriaornsak, 	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	Sansak,	2008).	
Granular	activated	carbon-SBR 	(GAC-SBR) 	system	
showed	a	higher	color	removal	efficiency	 than	SBR 
system	because	the	former	could	be	operated	under	a	
high	total	bio-sludge	 concentration	 resulting	from	the	
bio-film	mass	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	Kapdan	 et al,	
2000;	Sirianuntapiboon	 et al.,	2007;	Sirianutnapiboon	
and	Srisornsak, 	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	Sansak,	
2008;	Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Saengow,	2004).	According  
to	the	high	bio-sludge 	concentration 	operation,	the	
bio-sludge	 was	in	the	early	stationary	or	late	log	phase	
giving	the	high	color	adsorption	and	degradation 	yields	
(Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Saengow,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon  
et al.,	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Srisornsak,	 2007; 
Kapdan	and	Kargi,	2002).	However,	to	operate	GAC-SBR  
system	under	constant	bio-sludge	concentration 	was	quite	
difficult	due	to	the	bio-film	on	GAC	(Sirianuntapiboon  
et al.,	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	Srisornsak). 	Then,	the	
SBR	system,	operated	with	high	MLSS,	was	applied.	
It	was	found	that	the	color	removal	efficiency	 of	the	
system	with	STWW	containing	 80	mg/L	disperse	dye	
was	over	98%	at	an	MLSS	of	4,000	mg/L.	Also,	COD	
and	BOD5	and	TKN	removal	efficiencies	 were	high	in	
the	range	of	93.4±0.9%,	 97.0±0.1%	 and	85.1±2.6%,	
respectively. 	This	might	be	the	increasing	of	MLSS	
resulted	in	decrease	of	food/microbe 	ratio	(F/M).	Then,	
the	bio-sludge	of	the	system	was	in	the	late	log	phase	or	
early	stationary	phase	and	could	show	high	color	and	organic	removal	efficiencies 	(bio-sludge 	was	controlled	
as	the	high	SRT	of	over	25	days)	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	
Sirianuntapiboon 	and	Saengow,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	
et al.,	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	Srisornsak,	 2007).	  
This	phenomenon	 was	similar	to	our	previous  
observations	 where	bio-sludge	 of	GAC-SBR	 system	
with	long	SRT,	showed	high	vat	dye	removal	efficiency	
(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	Saengow,	
2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	and	Srisornsak,	2007).	
	 Moreover,	 the	SBR	system	did	not	show	any 
significant	different	on	color	removal	efficiency	for	
both	disperse	blue	60	and	disperse	red	60	because	the 
chemical	 structure	of	both	dyes	are	quite	similar  
(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	Society	of	Dyes	and	Colourists,	
1987).	But	the	system,	operated	at	an	MLSS	of	up	to	
4,000	mg/L,	showed	poor	bio-sludge	 quality	(SVI	of	 
over	100	mL/g).	Moreover,	 effluent	NO3-	and	TKN  
removal	efficiency	increased	with	the	increase	of	MLSS	
due	to	the	increase	of	the	number	of	nitrifying	bacteria	
(Nitrifying	 bacteria	transform	 organic	nitrogen	and 
ammonia	nitrogen	to	NO3-)	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004).	
Unfortunately,	 TN	removal	efficiency	 was	relatively	
low	but	the	effluent	NO3-	increased.	 This	might	 be	the	
effect	of	dispersed	dye	to	repress	the	growth	and	activity	
of	both	heterotrophic	 and	denitrifying	 bacteria,	but	it	
did	not	give	any	effect	to	nitrifying	bacteria	(Metcalf	
&	Eddy,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Saengow,	2004;	
Sirianuntapiboon et al.,	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	
Srisornsak, 	2007).	To	increase	TN	removal	efficiency	and	
decrease	the	effluent	NO3-	concentration,	 the	chemical  
composition	 of	the	wastewater	 and	operating	conditions  
of	the	SBR	should	be	optimized	to	increase	the	number 
and	activity	of	denitrifying 	bacteria	(Metcalf	&	
Eddy,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Saengow,	 2004;  
Sirianuntapiboon et al.,	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	
Srisornsak,	 2007).	TWW	might	be	diluted	to	reduce	
some	toxic	substances	 and	glucose	added	to	increase	
the	BOD	concentration 	at	the	suitable	level	for	the	
growth	of	denitrifying	 bacteria.	As	mentioned	 in	the	
materials	and	methods	section,	the	system	was	operated  
with	19	hrs	for	the	aeration	step	of	each	cycle;	thus	the	
growth	of		both	heterotrophic 	and	nitrifying	bacteria	was	
stimulated	 (Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon  
and	Sansak,	2008).	To	increase	the	growth	and	activity	
of	denitrifying 	bacteria,	the	anoxic	period	should	be	
increased	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	
and	Sansak,	2008).	The	system	also	showed	the	same	
removal	efficiency	and	performance 	patterns	with	
the	STWW	containing 	mixed-disperse 	dyes.	TKN	
removal	efficiency	was	not	affected	by	the	increase	of	
mixed-disperse	 dyes	concentration	 of	up	to	320	mg/L.	
Moreover,	 the	effluent	NO3-	increased	with	the	increase	
of	mixed-disperse	 dyes	concentration.	 From	the	above	
results,	it	can	be	concluded	 that	the	organic	nitrogen	S. Sirianuntapiboon et al. / EnvironmentAsia 5(2) (2012) 36-5247

4. Discussion  
 
  Our	previous	studies showed	that	both	SBR	and	 granular	activated	carbon -SBR	systems	could	
be applied to treat textile	wastewater	containing	 various	types	of	 dyestuffs (Sirianuntapiboon and 
Saengow,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	 et al.,	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon	and	Sriao rnsak,	2007;	
Sirianuntapiboon	and	Sansak,	2008 ).	Granular activated carbon -SBR	(GAC-SBR)	system	 showed  a 
higher	 color  removal	efficiency	than	SBR	system  because  the former could be operated under a high 
total bio-sludge	concentration	resul ting	from	the	 bio-film	mass	(Metcalf	&	Eddy ,	2004;	Kapdan	 et al,	
2000;	Sirianuntapiboon	 et al.,	2007;	Sirianutnapiboon	and	Srisornsak,	2007;	Sirianuntapiboon	and	
Sansak,	2008;	Sirianuntapiboon	and	Saengow,	2004 ). According	to	the	high	bio -sludge	concentration	
operation,	the bio-sludge	was	in	the	early	stationary	or	late	log	 phase	giving  the	high	 color adsorption	
and	degradation	yields	 (Sirianuntapiboon	and	Saengow,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	 et al.,	2007;	
Sirianuntapiboon	and	Srisornsak,	2007;	 Kapdan	and	Kargi,	2002 ). However,  to operat e GAC-SBR	
system	under	 constant	 bio-sludge	concentration	was	 quite  difficult  due to the bio -film	on	GAC  
(Sirianuntapiboon et al. ,	2007;	Siria nuntapiboon	and	Srisornsak ).	Then,	the	SBR	system ,	operated	
with	high	MLSS,	 was	applied.  It	was	found	that  the color  removal efficiency of	the	system	with	
STWW	containing	80	mg/L	disperse	dye	 was	over	9 8%	at an MLSS	of	4,000	mg/L . Also, COD	and	
BOD5 and	TKN	removal	efficiencies	were	 high	 in the range  of 93.4±0.9%,	97.0±0.1%	and	85.1±2. 6%,	
respectively.	 This	might be the increasing	of  MLSS	resulted	in	 decrease	 of food/microbe  ratio (F/M).	
Then,	the	bio -sludge	of	the	system  was	in	the	late	log	phase	or	early	stationary	phase  and could	show	
high	color	and	organic	removal	efficiencies	 (bio-sludge	was	controlled	as	 the	high	SRT	of	over	25	
days)	(Metcalf	&	Eddy ,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	and	Saengow,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	 et al.,	2007;	
Sirianuntapiboon	and	Srisornsak,	2007 ).	This	phenomen on was	similar	to	our	previous	 observation s 
where  bio-sludge	of	GAC -SBR	system  with  long	SRT,	 showed	high	vat	dye	removal	efficiency	
(Metcalf	&	Eddy ,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	and	Saengow,	2004;	Sirianu ntapiboon	and	Srisornsak,	
2007).	 
  Moreover,	the	SBR	system	did	not	show	any	significant  different	on	color	removal	efficiency	
for both	dis perse	blue	60	and	disperse	red	60	because  the	chemical	structure	of	both	dyes	 are	quite	46

compounds	 were	removed	by	both	heterotrophic  
bacteria	and	nitrifying	bacteria	similar	to	the	results	of	
SBR	system	with	STWW	containing	 disperse	dye.	The	
mixed-disperse 	dyes	of	STWW	might	affect	the	growth	
of	the	heterotrophic 	bacteria	resulting	in	decrease	of	the	
nitrogen	assimilation	 yield	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004).	
But,	they	did	not	affect	the	growth	of	nitrifying	bacteria  
which	resulted	in	increasing	 of	NO3- concentration 
of	wastewater 	after	SBR	system	treatment	(Metcalf	
&	Eddy,	2004).	Moreover,	 the	growth	and	activity	of	
denitrifying	 bacteria	were	repressed	by	the	increase	of	
mixed-disperse 	dyes	concentration 	of	STWW	(Metcalf	
&	Eddy,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	and	Sansak,	2008).
	 For	the	application 	of	the	SBR	system	to	treat	
TWW	containing 	mixed-disperse 	dyes,	the	system	
showed	quite	low	COD,	BOD5	and	dye	removal  
efficiencies, 	but	high	TKN	and	TN	removal	efficiencies.	
This	might	be	the	effect	of	low	organic	matter	(BOD5 
of	600±40	mg/L	for	TWW),	high	toxic	substances	 and	
high	disperse	dye	concentration 	resulting	in	the	decrease	
of	the	heterotrophic	 bacteria	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	
Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Sansak,	2008;	Sirianuntapiboon	
and	Saengow,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Srisornsak,	
2007).	But	it	did	not	affect	the	growth	and	activity	of	
nitrifying	bacteria.	The	results	were	similar	to	the	case	
of	SBR	system	with	STWW	containing 	single	and	mixed-disperse 	dyes.	This	confirms	that	the	organic	
(COD	and	BOD5)	removal	efficiency	 increased	with	
the	increase	of	the	diluted	rate	of	TWW.	The	organic	
(COD	and	BOD5)	removal	efficiency	also	increased	by	
adding	glucose	(BOD5)	which	was	confirmed	 by	the	
increasing	 of	excess	bio-sludge	 production	 (SRT	of	the	
system	was	shorten).	Unfortunately,	 the	TN	removal	
efficiency	 was	decreased.	 This	could	be	because	the	
system	was	operated	under	short	SRT	(high	excess	bio-
sludge	production	 by	increasing	 BOD5	concentration)  
which	could	stimulate	heterotrophic 	bacteria	to	be	
dominant	due	to	the	high	specific	growth	rate	and	reduce	
the	number	of	both	nitrifying	and	denitrifying	 bacteria	
due	to	low	specific	growth	rate	(Metcalf	&	Eddy,	2004;	
Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Sansak,	2008;	Sirianuntapiboon	
and	Saengow,	2004;	Sirianuntapiboon	 and	Srisornsak,	
2007).	It	was	also	found	that	the	dye	adsorption	 yields	
of	both	living	and	dead	bio-sludge	 were	repressed	by	
NaCl	because,	the	dye	adsorption	 sites	on	the	surface	
of	bio-sludge	 were	filled	with	Na+	(Sirianuntapiboon	
and	Sansak,	2008;	Sirianuntapiboon 	and	Hongsrisuwan,	
2006).	To	increase	the	dye	adsorption	 yield,	Na+ on the 
adsorption	sites	of	bio-sludge	and	in	the	solution	should	
be	eluted	and	eliminated,	respectively.	 From	the	above	results,	it	can	be	suggested	that	the	
biological	 treatment	process	especially,	 SBR	system S. Sirianuntapiboon et al. / EnvironmentAsia 5(2) (2012) 36-5250Moreover,	 the	contaminant	 NaCl	could	repress	the	dye	
adsorption	 yield	of	both	living	and	dead	bio-sludge.	
Thus,	NaCl	in	TWW	should	be	reduced	or	eliminated	
before	biological	treatment	by	SBR	system	to	obtain	a	
highest	removal	efficiency.

TWW	containing	 disperse	dyes,	but	the	disperse	dye 
removal	efficiency	 was	quite	low.	However,	 the	dye	
removal	efficiency	could	be	increased	by	adding	organic	
matter	such	as	glucose.	The	consequent	 increase	of	influent  
BOD5	might	reduce	the	number	of	both	nitrifying

and	Srisornsak, 	2007).	Also,	the	operating	program	
of	the	SBR	system	should	be	considered	 accordingly	
to	increase	the	growth	and	activity	of	nitrifying	and 
denitrifying	 bacteria	(to	increase	TN	removal	yield).

5. Conclusion	 SBR	system	under	high	MLSS	operation	can	
treat	textile	wastewater	 containing	 disperse	dyes.	The 
observed	color	removal	efficiency	 with	STWW	was	
over	98%	at	an	MLSS	of	4,000	mg/L.	The	system	
did	not	show	any	difference	 in	the	color	removal  
efficiency	 for	both	disperse	blue	60	and	disperse	red	
60.	Moreover,	 the	removal	efficiency	 decreased	 with	
the	increase	of	disperses	dye	concentration.	 However,	  
the	organic	(COD	and	BOD
5)	and	color	removal  
efficiencies 	were	increased	while	TN	and	TKN	removal	
efficiencies	 decreased	 by	increasing	 BOD5	loading	
or	concentration.	 Both	disperse	blue	60	and	disperse 
red	60	could	repress	the	growth	of	heterotrophic	
and	denitrifying	 bacteria,	but	they	did	not	show	any 
effect	on	the	growth	and	activity	of	nitrifying	bacteria.	Table	6.	Color	adsorption	 capacity	of	resting	(living)	and	autoclaved	 (dead)	bio-sludge	 with	disperse	dyes	(disperse	blue	60
