ABSTRACT 
Among pollution causing various industries, textile industry creates a major attention by environmentalists due to 
consumption of large volume of water, dyes and chemicals for various processing of textiles. Textile effluents contain 
carcinogenic aromatic amines, dyes, organic and inorganic mate rials. Removal of colored compounds from textile industry 
effluents by biological methods is currently available. Recent promising research works on biological decolorization of 
textile effluent have showed that variety of microorganisms and plants capable of decolorizing wide range of anionic and 
cationic dyes. This review article deals with the dye removing efficiency of fungi through biodegradation and biosorption 
mechanism. 
Key words : Biodecolorization, Fungal decolorization, Dye removing efficiency. 
INTRODUCTION 
Environmental pollution is caused by release of various chemicals as a consequence of industrial 
progress which has now become a persistent envir onmental contaminant. Due to rapid industrialization and 
urbanization a lot of chemicals including dyes, pigmen ts and aromatic molecular structural compounds were 
extensively used for several industrial applications such as textiles, printing, pharmaceuticals, food, toys, 
paper, plastic and cosmetics are manufactured and used in day -to-day life1. Textile dyes were classified as 
azo, diazo, cationic, basic, anthraquione and metal co mplex based, depending on thenature of their chemical 
structure2. There are more than 100,000 commercially available dyes with over 7 x 105 tons of dyestuff 
produced annually3,4. Around 8000 chemical products associated with the dyeing process are listed in the 
Colour Index (Society of Dyers and Colourists 1976). Chemical structure of the dyes was resistant to fading 
on exposure to light, water and many chemicals5. 
Discharge of colored effluents from dye manufactu ring units and textile processing industries was 
produced by various textile industry process. The produ ction of high amount of effluents mixes into water 
leading to pollution of aquatic systems an d represent major environmental problems7. Color was one of the 
most obvious indicators of water pollution and discha rge of highly colored synthetic dye effluents can 
damage the receiving water bodies8-15. Colored wastewaters associated with the reactive azo dye constitute 
approximately 30% of the total dye market.  Acta Chim. Pharm. Indica: 3(2), 2013  193
EXPERIMENTAL 
Reviews of literature 
• This paper crtically analyse the various recent resear ch works on fungal degradation of dyes and 
dye effluent, which were associated as pollutants to so lve the dangerous water pollution and save the future. 
White-rot fungi are those organisms that are able to  degrade lignin, the most complex structural 
polymer found in woody plants16. The most widely studied white-rot fungus, in regards to xenobiotic 
degradation, is Phanerochaete chrysosporium . This fungus is capable of degrading dioxins, polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs) and other chloro-organics17,18. Other whiterot fungi also decolorize dyes, e.g. Coriolus  
versicolo , Trametes versicolor19,20  Pleurotus ostreatus21 and Coriolopsis polysona22. 
Meanwhile, there are various other fungi, such as Umbelopsis isabellina  and Penicillium 
geastrivous23, Aspergillus foetidus  and Rhizopus oryzae24 which can also decolorize and/or adsorb dyes. 
Fungal decolorization is a promising alternative to replace or supplement present treatment processes. 
Using Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), strains of  terrestrial white rot (WRF) and marine fungi 
(MF) were screened for efficient decolorization. Dy e degradation potential of selected strains was studied 
with chemically different dyes (azo, anth raquinone, heterocyclic, triphenylmethane). Irpex lacteus  and 
Pleurotus ostreatus  (WRF) efficiently degraded dyes from all groups whereas less efficient and selective 
degradations were observed with Dactylospora haliotrepha  and Aspergillus ustus  (MF). Seawater salinity 
often reduced decolorization efficiency of WRF but increased decolorization ability of MF. In soil/lacteus 
removed 77% of RBBR used at 150 µg/g within 6 weeks.  The work presents fungi as suitable candidates to 
be applied to re-mediation of dye-contaminated water and soil25-37. 
Totally 19 isolates of Aspergillus strains were isolated from the environment samples collected from 
Meerut egions, Meerut, India. Different parameters such as various carbon source, nitrogen source, 
temperature, pH and salinity concentrations were optimized for decolorization oftextile dye Orange 3R byusing fugal isolates. Aspergillus strain (MMF3) showed maximum dye decolorization of 96% at the end of 5
th day under optimum condition and found to be more efficient in dye decolorization. All parameters 
studied in this paper were found to be effective for all isolates. The results reported here warrant further 
investigation to establish the useful ness of these isolates for ioremediation and biodegradation application 
suchas waste water treatment. High decolorization exten t and facile conditions show the potential for this 
fungal strain to be used in the biological treatment of dyeing mill effluents38. 
The fungal isolates Aspergillus flavus  and Aspergillus wentii  were evaluated for their ability to 
decolorize textile effluent and aqueous solution of dyes-Acid blue and yellow MGR. decolorization 
competence of both the strains was determined on Yeast-glucose peptone (YGP) and potato dextrose medium (PDA) containing 100 ppm of the textile dyes and 50 mL of effluent in 24 h of incubation in rotary shaker at 170 rpm at room temperature. The maximum d ecolorization was observed as 98.47% in effluent, 
94.41% by immobilized A. flavusin  Acid blue dye and 95.88% by immobilized A. wentiiin  Yellow MGR dye. 
Free cell of A. wemntii was able to decolorize effluent (88.58%), Acid blue (93.05%) and Yellow MGR dye 
(90.48%) in PDA medium
39. 
The increasing use of synthetic dyes is alarming and their discharge as textile waste may cause 
substantial ecological damage. Biological decolorization of dye using microorganisms is an environmentally friendly and cost-competitive alternative to chemic al methods. This study involves the application of laccase 
obtained from Pleurotus ostreatus , a common fungus, in decolorization and degradation of blue HFRL dye.  T. Marimuthu et al.: A Review of Fungal Degradation of …. 194
This azo dye is a major constituent present in most of the textile mill effluents. The fungal cultures were 
inoculated and laccase was produced by solid state ferment ation. The obtained enzyme was further used for 
dye decolorization on solid medium, liquid broth based medium and by using centre composite design. The 
results suggest the potential dye decolorization capacity of this fungal laccase40. 
Bioremediation using a variety of microbes for the degradation of xenobiotics seems a green 
solution to the problem of environmental pollution. Microbes have been gifted by nature with the ability of degrading a wide spectrum of environmental pollutants. Different fungi have the potentials to degrade complex and recalcitrant organic compounds into simpler fragments; sometimes achieving complete mineralization. We have investigated the decolorization and degradation of atriphenylmethane dye, malachite green by two fungal microorganisms, Aspergillus flavus  and Alternariasolani . Both the species 
were able to decolorize different concentrations of malachite green (10 to 50 µM) almost completely         
(> 96 %) within 6 days
41. 
Decolorization of azo dye red 3 BN by three fungal species Penicillium chrysogenum , Aspergillus  
niger  and Cladosporium sp.  has been analyzed using potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium containing 0.01% 
of Red 3 BN. Physico-chemical parameters like carb on source, nitrogen source, temperature, pH and 
inoculum volume are optimized for the decolorization Pr ocess by changing one parameter at a time. Optimal 
condition for P. chrysogenum  was found to be 1% maltose 1% yeast extract, pH 8, 27oC and 2% inoculums. 
Ideal condition for A. niger  was found to be 1% maltose, 1% yeast extract, pH 8, 27oC and 10% inoculum 
and that for Cladosporium sp . was found to be1% maltose, 1% peptone, pH 6, 37oC and 10% inoculum. 
Extent of decolorization recorded by P. chrysogenum  under ideal conditions was 99.56%, A. niger  was 
98.64% and that by Cladosporium sp . was 98.18%. The study has confirmed the potential of the above fungi 
in the decolorization of azo dye Red 3 BN and opened scope for future analysis of their performance in the 
treatment of textile effluent42. 
The biosorption potential of three fungal waste-biomasses43 (Acremoniumstrictum , Acremonium sp. 
and Penicillium sp.) from pharmaceutical companies was compared with that of a selected biomass 
(Cunninghamella elegans ), already proven to bevery effective in dye biosorption. Among the waste-
biomasses, A. strictum was the most efficient (decolorization percen tage up to 90% within 30 min) with 
regard to three simulated dye baths; nevertheless it was less active than C. elegans which was able to 
produce a quick and substantial decolorization of all th e simulated dye baths (up to 97%within 30 min). The 
biomasses of A. strictum and C. elegans were then tested for the treatment of nine real exhausted dye baths. 
A. strictum was effective at acidic or neutral pH, whereas C. elegans c onfirmed its high efficiency and 
versatility towards exhausted dyebaths characterised by diffe rent classes of dyes (acid, disperse, vat, reactive) 
and variation in pH and ionic strength. Finally, the eff ect of pH on the biosorption process was evaluated to 
provide a realistic estimation of the validity of the laboratory results in an industrial setting. The C. elegans 
biomass was highly effective from pH 3 to pH 11 (for amounts of adsorbed dye up to 1054 and 667 mg of 
dye g−1 biomass dry weight, respectively); thus, this biomass can be considered an excellent and 
exceptionally versatile biosorbent material. 
An enormous number of articles published in the last two decades cover the ‘fungal dye 
decolourization’44. This proves that great attention has been paid by researchers to use the lignin degrading 
enzymatic system of white-rot fungi for solving this serious pollution problem. A considerable amount of 
work in the fungal decolourization studies has been co nducted on a laboratory s cale to find fungal strains 
with effective enzymes. The main fungal enzymes have  been indicated and various mechanisms have been 
explained, however, several studies show that unknown enzymes or mechanisms, respectively, are still 
present. The studies mainly cover chemically defined dyes, while the research with wastewater from Acta Chim. Pharm. Indica: 3(2), 2013  195
dyestuff industry is are. White-rot fungi as a group can decolourize a wide range of dyes. Nevertheless, the 
chemical and physical decolourization and/or degradation processes are usually faster than the processes 
using fungal cultures. In addition, a fungal cultivat ion takes place under sterile conditions, which increases 
the cost of bioremediation technology and additionally lowers the economics of the process. Unfortunately, 
there are not many results of dye degradation during  the cultivation under non-sterile operation conditions 
available yet. Therefore, the research of screening or genetic manipulation of fungi to be more resistant, to 
be capable of faster dye degradation, to reach higher mineralization degree or to use dyes as sole substrates 
would also be of great interest. 
Dyes and pigments are widely used, mostly in the textile, paper, plastics, leathers, food and 
cosmetics industry to color products. Textile industry consumes large volume of water and produce large 
amount of wastewater during all phases of textile pro duction and finishing. The release of colored effluents 
represents a serious green pollution and a human health concern particularly in developing countries like 
Ethiopia (East Africa). Color removal, especially from textile effluents, has gargantuan challenge over the 
last decades, and up to now there is no single and cost-effectively attractive treatment that can effectively 
decolourise as well as treat the dyes effluents.45  
A fungal isolate Aspergillus terreus SA3 previously isolated from the waste water of a local textile 
industry was efficiently utilized for the removal of dye  (Sulfur black) from textile effluent. The treatment 
was performed in a self designed lab scale stirred tank bioreactor. The reactor with 5 L capacity (working 
volume 2 L) were operated at room temperature and pH  5.0 in continuous flow mode with different dye 
concentrations (50, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 500 ppm) in simulated textile effluent (STE). The reactors were 
run on fill, react, settle and draw mode with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24-72 h, depending upon the 
concentration of dye. Overall color, BOD and COD in the Stirred tank reactor system (STR) were removed 
by 84.53, 66.50 and 75.24%, respectively with 50 ppm dye concentration and HRT of 24 h. The removal 
efficiency of the reactor decreased as the concentration of the dye was increased. This STR system was 
found very effective for efficient tr eatment of textile waste water (up to 200 ppm Sulfur black dye) by the 
fungal strain A.46 
A number of biotechnological approaches have been suggested by recent research as of potential 
interest towards combating this pollution source in an  eco-efficient manner, including the use of bacteria or 
fungi, often in combination with physicochemical processes47. Biotreatment depicts a cheaper and 
environmentally friendlier alternative for colour removal in textile effluents. The ecofriendly microbial 
decolorization and detoxification is a alternative to th e physical and chemical methods. The kinetics of 
decolorization and the environmental factors affecting the decolorization rates is relatively scarce61. A wide 
variety of microorganisms arecapable of decolorization of a wide range of dyes some of them are as bacteria 
Escherichia coli  NO 3, Pseudomonas luteola , Aeromonashydrophila ; Fungi: aspergillus niger , 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Aspergillusterricola , P. chrysosporium ; yeasts: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
Candida tropicalis, C. lipolytica; algae: Spirogyra species Chlorella vulgaris  C. sorokiniana , Lemna 
minuscula, Scenedesmus obliquus, C.  pyrenoidosa and Closterium lunula48. 
Synthetic textile dye under static and shaking conditions  with respect to various parameters. Direct 
red dye belong to an important group of synthetic dye us ed in textile industries. They are considered as 
recalcitrant compound for degradation. In the present study batch experiment was conducted for the 
decolorization of direct red dye using Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus under static and shaking 
conditions. At 50 mg/L 97% and 87 % decolorization was achieved with Aspergillus niger  in 48 hrs at static 
and shaking condition but in case of A. flavus percen tage of decolourization was found to be 78 % and 83 %  T. Marimuthu et al.: A Review of Fungal Degradation of …. 196
in 48 hrs in static and shaking condition, respectively.  During the adsorption isotherm studies decolorization 
followed Freundlich model for both the organisms with regression coefficient value of 0.833 and this study 
brings out the ability of Aspergillus sp.  to degrade reactive dyes and reinforces the potential of this group of 
fungi for the decolorisation of textile effluents49. 
A dye decolorizing fungal strain, Phanerochaete chrysosporium MTC 787 was used in batch 
experiments for decolorization of the dye, Acid orange 10. Effects of initial substrate (dye) and fungal concentrations on the rate and extent of dye decolo rization were investigated. The initial pH and oxidation–
reduction potential (ORP) was kept at 4.5 and −250 mV, respectively. The rate and extent of dye 
decolorization increased with increasing dye concentration up to100 g L
−1 and then decreased for larger dye 
concentrations. The rate of enzyme utilization and dye decolorization alsoincreased linearly with increasing 
initial biomass concentration. A kinetic model describing the rate of enzyme utilization and substrate 
inhibition as function of the initial substrate and flow  rate was developed. The kinetic constants were 
determined using the experimental data. The initial biomass should be above 3.2 x 105 cell/mL to obtain 
high rates and decolorization percentage and to avoid substrate inhibition50. 
The discharge of highly coloured effluents containing dyes can be damaging to the receiving marine 
water bodies and can result in serious environmental pollution problems51. Hence, considerable attention has 
been given in determining the ability of marine micr oorganism in decolorization and degradation of textile 
dyes. Decolorization and degradation of reactiv e blue 171 was carried out using the acclimatized 
Marinobacter sp. NB-6 (AccessionNo . HF56873) isolated from soil. The decolorization of dye reactive blue 
171 in 24 hours was up to 95.00% in nutrient broth having 8.0% NaCl and also it showed 93.11% 
decolorization in half strength nutrient broth ha ving the same NaCl concentration. The percent 
decolorization of the dye was also studied by ce ll-free extract and was observed that the isolate can 
decolorize the dye 90.00% in 24 hours. The percent decolorization of the dye was determined spectrophotometrically at 590 nm. The percent COD re duction of the dye by the isolate was 86.00%. The 
degradation products formed after degradation were  analyzed by GC-MS technique and it was found that 
this culture degraded reactive blue 171 to the products having molecular weights 98, 99, 149, 150, 223, 70, 86, 125, 154, 155, 149, 150, 223, 149, 150, 223, 57, 113, 149, 167 and 279. The microbial toxicity study revealed the degradation of reactive blue 171 into non -toxic products by Marinobacter sp. NB-6. From the 
study performed, we conclude that, this acclimatized species can prove better option for bioremediation of 
textile dye in wastes containing high salts and in marine environment. 
Water pollution through industrial discharges, which is mainly in the form of effluent or wastewater, 
is one of the biggest problems. These effluents have strong concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), phenol and its derivatives and often contain metals, inorganic nutrients, organic compounds, proteins, cyanides, chlorinated lignin and dyes. Bi oremediation of toxic industrial effluents by 
microorganisms serves as an effective method to subs titute the conventional recovery and removal processes. 
Fungal biomasses have huge capability of treating effluents discharged from various industries. White rot fungi are ubiquitous in nature and their adaptability to extreme conditions makes them good biode-graders. 
Their enzyme producing activity makes them eff ective decolorizers; they remove toxic metals by 
biosorbtion ultimately rendering the effluents more ecofriendly
52-57. 
CONCLUSION 
Fungal decolorization of dye effluent is receiving much consideration due to cost effective and less 
regeneration by microorganisms su ch as bacteria, fungi, yeast, algae,  and plants. Recent fundamental 
research works have revealed the existence of wide variety of microorganisms capable of decolorizing wide range of dyes. The use of microorganisms for the removal of synthetic dyes from industrial effluents offers Acta Chim. Pharm. Indica: 3(2), 2013  197
considerable advantages this process was relatively inexpensive, running costs were low and the end 
products were completely mineralized with no toxicity. Degradation of dye is a complex process works to 
detoxify, decolorize, and degrade the dyes are done in lab scale only. Hence the need of effective complete 
conversion of textile effluent into useful liquid waste by using microbes is required.
