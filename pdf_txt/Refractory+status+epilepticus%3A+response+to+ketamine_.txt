1.  Introduction
Refractory  status  epilepticus  (RSE)  refers  to  status  epilepticus
(SE)  that  cannot  be  resolved  in  terms  of  clinical  manifestations  or
epileptiform  discharges  following  the  rational  administration  of
anticonvulsants  including  a  benzodiazepine  [1].  Super-refractory
status  epilepticus  (super-RSE)  refers  to  drug-resistant  status
epilepticus  that  persists  or  recurs  following  the  continuous
administration  of  intravenous  anesthetics  for  more  than  24  h
[2],  and  the  primary  etiologies  of  super-RSE  are  brain  insults,  such
as  intracranial  infection,  brain  trauma  or  stroke  [2,3] .  SE  is  an  acute
and  severe  illness  of  the  central  nervous  system.  When  the  seizure
duration  exceeds  30  min,  the  mortality  rate  is  19%  [4].  Among  RSE
patients,  the  mortality  rate  is  as  high  as  23–61%  [5],  and
approximately  90%  of  RSE  survivors  ultimately  relapse  [4,6,7] .  Ke-
tamine  could  play  an  important  role  in  the  treatment  of  RSE  by
altering  glutamate  metabolism,  particularly  in  patients  who
exhibit  a  poor  response  to  benzodiazepines.
2.  Background
Ketamine  was  developed  by  the  Parke-Davis  (USA)  pharma-
ceutical  company  in  1962.  Three  years  later,  McCarthy  et  al.  [8]
found  the  ﬁrst  evidence  that  ketamine  exerts  an  anticonvulsant
effect  in  epilepsy  animal  models  that  were  electrically  orchemically  created.  These  results  were  soon  conﬁrmed  in  patients
[9],  raising  the  possibility  of  treating  SE  using  ketamine,  although
this  possibility  was  soon  questioned.  The  experiments  by  Kayama
and  Iwama  [10]  using  cat  models  revealed  that  ketamine  could
induce  epileptic  changes,  based  on  EEG  recordings.  However,  a
similar  study  of  human  volunteers  conducted  by  Corssen  et  al.  [11]
rejected  this  conclusion.  These  authors  found  that  ketamine  did
not  cause  epileptiform  discharges  in  epilepsy  patients  or  in  normal
subjects  and  that  no  evidence  was  available  to  support  the  notion
that  ketamine  could  induce  or  exacerbate  convulsions,  in  contrast
with  the  conclusions  of  Kayama  [12,13] .
In  recent  years,  many  researchers  have  reported  that,  during
prolonged  seizures,  the  number  of  activated  GABA-A  receptors  on
the  postsynaptic  membrane  gradually  decreases,  whereas  the
number  of  inactive  GABA-A  receptors  increases  [14,15] .  These
changes  cause  a  signiﬁcant  reduction  in  the  efﬁcacy  of  antiepileptic
drugs  (AEDs)  that  target  the  GABAergic  system,  such  as  diazepam,
clonazepam,  valproic  acid,  midazolam,  propofol,  and  phenobarbi-
tal.  Increased  doses  of  AEDs  might  restore  their  efﬁcacy,  but  the
side  effects  of  AEDs  on  cardiopulmonary  function  are  simulta-
neously  signiﬁcantly  increased,  thus  limiting  the  clinical  applica-
tions  of  such  increased  doses.  However,  a  study  by  Dingledine  et  al.
[16]  reported  that  the  number  and  activities  of  glutamate-sensitive
N-methyl- D-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptors  signiﬁcantly  increased
when  the  activity  of  GABA  receptors  decreased.  Subsequently,  this
process  induced  continuously  ampliﬁed  neuronal  hyperexcitabili-
ty,  leading  to  the  development  of  RSE.  Ketamine  is  a  noncompeti-
tive  NMDA  receptor  antagonist  [16]  that  might  play  a  role  in
treating  SE  by  blocking  NMDA  receptor-mediated  glutamatergicSeizure  30  (2015)  14–20

Status epilepticus  (SE)A  B  S  T  R  A  C  T
Status  epilepticus  (SE)  is  an  acute  and  severe  illness  of  the  central  nervous  system,  and  prolonged  SE  can
lead  to  brain  damage  and  even  death.  Ketamine  is  a  noncompetitive  antagonist  of  glutamatergic  N-
methyl- D-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptors.  During  prolonged  seizures,  the  numbers  and  activities  of  GABA
receptors  gradually  decrease;  thus,  the  commonly  used  ﬁrst-line  and  second-line  antiepileptic  drugs
gradually  fail.  Simultaneously,  the  numbers  and  activities  of  glutamatergic  NMDA  receptors  increase,
often  causing  refractory  status  epilepticus  (RSE)  and  thus  providing  the  possibility  of  the  use  of  ketamine
to  treat  RSE.  To  improve  the  prognosis  of  SE,  we  present  a  narrative  review  of  ketamine  for  the  treatment
of  RSE  in  the  extant  literature.  We  draw  the  conclusion  that  ketamine  appears  to  be  effective  and
relatively  safe  for  the  control  of  multidrug-resistant  RSE  in  children  and  adults.

mediated  NMDA  receptor-induced  neurotoxicity,  ketamine  also
exerts  neuroprotection  [19–21] .  Therefore,  ketamine  has  been
proposed  as  a  new  therapeutic  agent  for  the  treatment  of  SE  [22–24] .
3.  Ketamine  for  the  treatment  of  RSE
3.1.  Clinical  practice
Gaspard  et  al.  [25]  retrospectively  analyzed  the  results  of
intravenous  ketamine  treatment  of  RSE.  This  study  included  58  RSE
patients  treated  with  ketamine  intravenously  from  1999  to  2012,
among  whom  46  patients  were  adults,  and  12  patients  were
children.  These  patients  experienced  a  total  of  60  episodes  of  RSE.
The  results  indicated  that,  among  the  57%  (34/60)  of  cases  in  which
the  seizures  ultimately  resolved,  approximately  32%  (19/60)  of  the
seizures  were  halted  due  to  the  effects  of  ketamine,  and
approximately  13%  (8/60)  of  the  cases  of  RSE  were  controlled
during  ketamine  use.  Similarly,  a  prospective  study  by  Rosati  et  al.
[26]  also  demonstrated  that  ketamine  was  relatively  effective  and
safe  for  the  treatment  of  RSE.  This  study  included  9  RSE  children
who  received  intravenous  ketamine  between  2009  and  2011.  In  8
patients,  seizures  had  persisted  for  more  than  1  day  prior  toketamine  selection.  Finally,  6  patients  who  experienced  RSE
resolution  were  thought  to  be  associated  with  ketamine  adminis-
tration,  2  patients  were  cured  surgically,  and  no  serious  adverse
reactions  were  recorded  in  all  of  the  patients.  In  2003,  Mewasingh
et  al.  [27]  reported  6  cases  of  the  use  of  oral  ketamine  to  treat
children  (4–7  years  old)  with  nonconvulsive  RSE  (NCSE),  including
Lennox–Gastaut  syndrome,  pseudo-Lennox  syndrome,  progressive
myoclonic  epilepsy  and  myoclonic-astatic  epilepsy.  All  of  the
seizures  remained  prolonged  despite  the  use  of  many  antic-
onvulsants,  and  the  median  duration  of  these  seizures  was  4.4
weeks  (range  2–10  weeks).  Thus,  these  authors  decided  to  use  oral
ketamine  to  treat  RSE;  fortunately,  all  of  the  patients  experienced
resolution  within  24–48  h  after  the  initiation  of  ketamine,
resulting  in  a  clear  reduction  in  epileptiform  discharges  on  EEG
and  improvement  of  the  mental  state  of  the  patients.  Although  one
of  the  children  experienced  a  relapse  a  few  months  later,  the
continued  use  of  ketamine  remained  effective,  and  no  apparent
side  effects  were  recorded  during  ketamine  treatment.  Herein,  we
have  summarized  the  available  studies  on  ketamine  for  the
treatment  of  RSE,  which  are  presented  in  Tables  1  and  2.
Collectively,  these  results  indicate  that  ketamine  is  primarily
suitable  for  the  treatment  of  RSE  and  super-RSE  during  prolonged
seizures,  which  is  also  supported  by  the  conclusions  of  an  animal

was  initiated  after  15  min  of  SE,  none  of  the  animals  exhibited
responses  to  ketamine  (0/4);  however,  when  ketamine  was
initiated  after  1  h  of  seizures,  the  successful  termination  rate
was  100%  (4/4).  Moreover,  after  a  prolonged  seizure  duration,  a
corresponding  increase  in  the  dose  of  ketamine  was  found  to  be
effective  within  a  certain  time  period.
3.2.  An  evidence-based  clinical  study  on  the  use  of  ketamine  to  treat
RSE
In  2014,  Zeiler  et  al.  [41]  published  a  systematic  review  of
NMDA-receptor  antagonists  for  the  treatment  of  RSE.  Twenty-
three  studies  were  ultimately  included  in  this  analysis,  which
included  a  total  of  162  patients  consisting  of  110  adults  (range  19–
88  years  old)  and  52  children  (range  2  months–18  years  old).  In  all
of  these  studies,  ketamine  was  used  to  treat  RSE.  This  study
revealed  that  ketamine  was  effective  for  56.5%  (59/110)  of  the
adults  and  63.5%  (33/52)  of  the  children  and  that  the  rate  of  side
effects  related  to  ketamine  administration  was  1.8%  (2/110)  in  the
adults  and  17.3%  (9/52)  in  the  children,  supporting  the  use  of
ketamine  for  the  treatment  of  RSE  in  children  and  adults  and
indicating  that  adverse  reaction  rates  related  to  ketamine
administration  were  relatively  small.  However,  this  review  also
has  some  limitations  such  as  the  retrospective  heterogeneous
nature  of  the  data,  the  small  sample  sizes  of  the  studies  included,
and  the  heterogeneity  of  the  medications  prior  to  ketamine
treatment,  the  timing  of  ketamine  use,  and  the  dosage  and
duration  of  this  drug.  Thus,  larger  prospective  studies  are
necessary  to  assess  the  efﬁcacy  and  safety  of  ketamine  treatment
in  RSE.
4.  The  possible  antiepileptic  and  neuroprotective  mechanisms
of  ketamine  action
4.1.  The  possible  mechanism  of  the  effects  of  ketamine  on  SE
With  decreased  GABA-receptor  activity,  the  expression  of  the
NMDA  receptor  is  up-regulated,  and  the  activity  of  this  receptor  is
also  increased  in  late  SE.  The  NMDA  receptor  is  one  of  the  main
receptor  subtypes  that  mediates  glutamatergic  neurotransmission,
and  it  is  also  a  nonspeciﬁc  cation  channel  that  contains  the  NMDA
binding  site  and  the  phencyclidine  (PCP)  binding  site  [42].  When
the  cell  is  at  rest,  Mg2+,  located  on  the  inner  side  of  the  channels,
blocks  the  channels.  When  the  cell  membrane  is  depolarized,  the
combined  actions  of  glutamate  and  glycine  on  the  NMDA  receptor
remove  the  blocking  effect  of  Mg2+,  and  the  activation  of  the
receptor  can  induce  inﬂuxes  of  calcium  and  sodium,  which
participate  in  the  transmission  of  excitatory  nerve  impulses  in
different  brain  circuits  [16].  However,  ketamine,  which  is  a
noncompetitive  antagonist  of  the  NMDA  receptor,  can  block  the
ﬂow  of  Ca2+and  Na+by  combining  with  the  PCP  site  inside  of  the
ion  channel  of  the  NMDA  receptor  and  can  thereby  reduce
epileptiform  burst  discharges  and  after-potentials,  thus  inhibiting
the  conduction  of  excitation  and  playing  an  anticonvulsive  role
[18].
4.2.  The  neuroprotective  effects  of  ketamine
With  prolonged  SE,  cell  depolarization  also  continues,  leading
to  the  excessive  release  of  excitatory  neurotransmitters  that  can
bind  to  a  variety  of  receptors  to  produce  neurotoxicity.  Among
these  receptors,  the  NMDA  receptor  might  play  a  critical  role  in  this
effect  [43–47] .  do  Nascimento  et  al.  [48]  detected  hippocampal
neuronal  damage  in  rats  in  which  SE  had  been  induced  by
pilocarpine.  Using  Fluoro-Jade  (FJB)  and  cresyl  violet  staining,these  authors  detected  multiple  sites  of  neuronal  damage  3  h,  6  h,
12  h,  24  h,  1  week,  and  3  weeks  after  prolonged  SE.  These  sites  of
damage  were  primarily  located  in  the  hippocampal  dentate  gyrus,
the  CA1  zone,  and  the  CA3  zone.  Moreover,  the  neuronal  damage
was  most  extensive  in  the  dentate  hilus  after  3  and  12  h  of  seizures
(P  <  0.05).  However,  one  week  after  the  seizures,  the  greatest
neuronal  damage  was  located  in  the  pyramidal  cell  layer  of  the  CA1
and  CA3  regions  in  the  hippocampus  (P  <  0.05),  and  the  most
serious  neurotoxicity  was  observed  in  the  hippocampal  CA1
pyramidal  cell  layer  (P  <  0.05).  The  NMDA  receptor  antagonist
ketamine  not  only  blocks  the  inﬂux  of  Ca2+but  also  exerts  anti-
inﬂammatory  and  antioxidant  effects  [49,50] .  Therefore,  ketamine
exerts  protective  effects  in  the  central  nervous  system.  Fujikawa
[51]  used  pilocarpine  to  induce  epilepsy  in  a  rat  model  and  then
administered  100  mg/kg  ketamine  or  saline  to  the  rats  via
intraperitoneal  injection  after  10  min  of  seizures.  Three  hours
later,  the  seizures  were  terminated  with  intraperitoneal  injections
of  diazepam  and  phenobarbital.  After  24  h,  these  authors
performed  perfusion  ﬁxation  to  obtain  slices  of  the  rat  brains,
which  were  observed  under  a  microscope.  They  found  that,  in  the  5
rats  that  had  been  injected  with  saline,  neuronal  damage  was
observed  in  24  of  25  brain  regions;  however,  in  the  7  rats  that
received  ketamine  treatment,  the  drug  was  found  to  exert
neuroprotective  effects  in  22  of  the  24  damaged  brain  regions.
Regardless  of  whether  the  seizures  were  ultimately  terminated,
this  neuroprotection  remained  present  and  was  beneﬁcial  to  the
recovery  from  SE.
5.  Onset  time
Ketamine  displays  relatively  high  fat  solubility  and  a  low
plasma  protein  binding  rate,  causing  it  rapidly  penetrate  the
blood–brain  barrier;  thus,  ketamine  exhibits  the  property  of  rapid
onset.  It  has  been  reported  that,  when  ketamine  is  administered
intravenously,  the  interval  to  the  maximum  plasma  concentration
(Tmax)  is  from  1  to  5  min,  and  when  ketamine  is  administered
orally,  the  Tmaxis  from  15  to  30  min  [52].  As  observed  by  Kramer
[33],  when  a  bolus  of  50  mg  of  ketamine  was  intravenously
administered,  followed  by  infusion  at  an  initial  rate  of  0.6  mg/kg/h,
reduced  seizure  frequency,  shortened  seizure  duration,  and
decreased  epileptiform  discharge  amplitude  were  immediately
observed,  indicating  that  ketamine  acts  rapidly  in  the  treatment  of
RSE.  This  conclusion  has  been  supported  by  other  studies  [39,53] .
Additionally,  Sheth  and  Gidal  [39]  noted  that  the  onset  time  of
intravenous  ketamine  was  within  90  s  after  initiation.  However,  in
the  majority  of  cases,  seizures  are  often  completely  terminated
within  24  h  when  ketamine  is  selected  for  the  treatment  of  SE  [25].
When  ketamine  is  administered  orally,  the  interval  to  complete
seizure  control  is  within  24–48  h  [27].
6.  Dosage
Currently,  the  administration  of  ketamine  for  the  treatment  of
RSE  involves  intravenous  and  oral  routes.  When  ketamine  is
selected  for  RSE  treatment  following  prolonged  SE,  it  maybe
typically  suitable  after  5–6  anticonvulsants  have  been  found  to  be
ineffective.  This  treatment  choice  is  summarized  from  previous
successful  reports  [25,26,29] ,  and  the  rationale  for  its  use  is  based
on  prolonged  seizure  duration,  decreased  numbers  of  active  GABA
receptors,  gradual  elevation  of  NMDA  receptor  activity,  and
increased  numbers  of  NMDA  receptors  [14–16,54,55] .
6.1.  Intravenous  administration
(1)  Intravenous  bolus  followed  by  continuous  infusion:
when  ketamine  is  used  for  adult  RSE,  an  average  loading  dose  ofY.  Fang,  X.  Wang  /  Seizure  30  (2015)  14–20  171.5  mg/kg,  followed  by  an  average  infusion  rate  of  2.75  mg/kg/h  for
4  days  (0–24  days)  is  recommended  [25].  An  analysis  by  Gaspard
et  al.  [25]  revealed  that  the  maximum  loading  dose  of  ketamine  is
5  mg/kg  and  that  the  maximum  infusion  rate  is  10  mg/kg/h.
Moreover,  Synowiec  et  al.  [30]  found  that  a  bolus  dose  of  1–2  mg/
kg,  followed  by  maintenance  at  an  infusion  rate  of  1.3  mg/kg/h
(range  0.45–2.1  mg/kg/h)  for  9.8  days  (range  4–28  days),  resulted
in  a  successful  seizure  control  rate  of  100%  (11/11).  When
ketamine  is  administered  to  children,  we  recommend  a  2–3  mg/
kg  bolus  of  ketamine  every  5  min  for  a  total  of  2  administrations,
followed  by  maintenance  at  a  rate  of  40  mg/kg/min  (range  10–
60  mg/kg/min)  for  6.7  days  (range  3–17  days)  [26].  (2)  Intravenous
infusion:  Zelier  et  al.  [31]  performed  continuous  infusion  of
ketamine  at  10–40  mg/kg/min  for  the  treatment  of  RSE,  and  the
seizures  in  all  of  the  patients  were  ultimately  effectively  controlled
(2/2).  In  a  report  by  Gosselin-Lefebvre  et  al.  [56],  ketamine  was
initiated  in  9  SE  patients  when  8  AEDs  had  failed,  and  the  seizures
had  persisted  for  12  days.  The  average  rate  of  ketamine  infusion
was  5  mg/kg/h  (range  2–15  mg/kg/h).  Ultimately,  the  seizures
were  completely  halted  in  4  patients  (4/9),  partially  controlled  in  3
patients  (3/9),  and  not  controlled  in  only  2  patients  (2/9).  Finally,
the  recommended  dosage  for  children  is  32.5  mg/kg/min  (range
10–60  mg/kg/min)  when  intravenous  infusion  of  ketamine  alone  is
selected  [57].
6.2.  Oral  administration
The  use  of  oral  ketamine  to  treat  RSE  has  only  been  reported  in
NCSE.  The  recommended  dosage  of  ketamine  is  1500–2000  mg/d
for  adults  [34]  and  1.5  mg/kg/d,  administered  as  two  separate
doses,  for  children  [27].
The  usage  of  ketamine  for  the  treatment  of  RSE  is  summarized
in  Table  3.
7.  Adverse  reactions  and  precautions  for  ketamine  use
Zeiler  et  al.  [41]  performed  a  systematic  review,  which
indicated  that  the  adverse  reactions  related  to  ketamine  treatment
for  RSE  were  rare.  However,  due  to  the  lack  of  controlled  studies
related  to  this  topic,  concern  remains  warranted,  primarily
regarding  psychiatric  symptoms  during  anesthesia  recovery,
increased  intracranial  pressure  (ICP),  increased  secretion  of  saliva,
increased  intraocular  pressure,  and  arrhythmia.  Details  regarding
the  adverse  reactions  and  precautions  for  ketamine  use  are
described  as  follows.
7.1.  Psychiatric  symptoms
The  psychiatric  symptoms  caused  by  treatment  of  RSE  with
ketamine  are  primarily  related  to  hallucinations,  delirium,  a
ﬂoating  sensation,  dreams,  and  blurred  vision  [58].  The  incidences
of  these  symptoms  are  5–30%.  Children  are  at  the  lowest  risk  forpsychiatric  symptoms,  which  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  patients
over  16  years  old,  in  female  patients,  or  when  the  administration
rate  or  dosage  is  too  high  [58].  A  quiet  and  relaxing  environment
can  help  to  reduce  the  incidences  of  these  side  effects  [59].
Additionally,  prophylactic  administration  of  3.75–7.5  mg  of  mid-
azolam  could  reduce  the  probability  and  severity  of  adverse
reactions  [59].
7.2.  Increased  ICP
As  early  as  40  years  ago,  there  were  reports  that  ketamine
improved  the  cerebral  metabolic  rate  and  increased  cerebral  blood
ﬂow,  thereby  increasing  ICP  [60].  However,  due  to  the  develop-
ments  of  related  studies,  researchers  have  proposed  new
hypotheses  regarding  the  effects  of  ketamine  on  ICP,  ﬁnding  that,
when  patients  are  breathing  spontaneously,  ketamine  causes
intracranial  hypertension  that  is  primarily  associated  with
increased  PaCO 2in  the  arterial  blood;  however,  when  patients
are  sedated  and  mechanically  ventilated,  the  effects  of  ketamine  on
ICP  are,  in  fact,  very  small  [59].  A  systematic  evaluation,  published
in  2014,  showed  that,  when  ketamine  was  used  for  nontraumatic
neurological  diseases,  it  did  not  increase  ICP,  and  in  some  cases,
ketamine  might  even  reduce  ICP  [61].  Gaspard  et  al.  [25]  studied  58
patients  treated  with  ketamine  and  observed  only  2  cases  of  mild
ICP  elevation.  Actually,  prior  to  the  initiation  of  ketamine,  these  2
patients  had  suffered  from  brain  edema  secondary  to  anoxic  brain
injury.
7.3.  Increased  secretion  of  saliva
Ketamine  can  induce  the  secretion  of  saliva,  accompanied  by
the  hypersecretion  of  bronchial  mucus,  which  can  lead  to  transient
inhibition  of  the  respiratory  system  or  apnea.  To  prevent  this
adverse  effect,  anticholinergic  drugs,  such  as  scopolamine  or
atropine,  can  be  prophylactically  administered  during  the  clinical
application  of  ketamine  treatment  [52].
7.4.  Increased  intraocular  pressure
The  effects  of  ketamine  on  intraocular  pressure  remain
controversial  [62].  Some  authors  believe  that  ketamine  can  cause
an  increase  in  intraocular  pressure  [63],  whereas  others  have
stated  that  it  can  reduce  intraocular  pressure  [64]  or  that  ketamine
exerts  no  effect  on  intraocular  pressure  [65].  This  discrepancy  may
be  attributable  to  the  many  factors  that  can  inﬂuence  intraocular
pressure,  such  as  the  aqueous  humor  circulation,  extraocular
muscle  tension,  choroidal  blood  ﬂow,  vitreous  volume,  etc.  [50].  In
fact,  the  inﬂuence  of  ketamine  on  intraocular  pressure  has  been
shown  to  be  mild  and  even  smaller  than  the  effects  of  laryngoscopy
[50].  Thus,  when  ketamine  is  used  for  RSE,  it  exerts  little  effect  on
intraocular  pressure,  and  the  combined  use  of  benzodiazepines  can
alleviate  this  effect  [62].

The  arrhythmias  induced  by  ketamine  are  often  tachyarrhyth-
mias,  which  might  occur  because  ketamine  can  excite  the
sympathetic  nervous  system  and  shorten  atrial  conduction
[66,67] .  Gaspard  et  al.  [25]  examined  58  RSE  patients  who
received  ketamine  and  found  that  only  3  patients  exhibited
arrhythmias.  Two  of  these  patients  exhibited  supraventricular
tachycardia,  and  their  symptoms  were  alleviated  following  the
withdrawal  of  ketamine.  The  other  patient  exhibited  atrial
ﬁbrillation  that  was  relieved  using  amiodarone.
7.6.  Neurotoxicity
The  effects  of  ketamine  on  the  human  central  nervous  system
remain  controversial.  In  1991,  it  was  found  that  ketamine  exerts
toxic  effects  on  some  regions  of  the  cerebral  cortex  in  rats.
Ketamine  was  found  to  be  capable  of  causing  regional  neuronal
vacuolation  or  even  necrosis,  and  since  this  ﬁnding,  clinicians  have
become  more  cautious  regarding  the  selection  of  this  drug.
However,  over  the  last  20  years,  this  conclusion  has  yet  to  be
conﬁrmed  or  generally  accepted  [68].  Most  researchers  believe
that  regular  doses  of  ketamine  cause  only  mild  neurotoxicity,
possibly  because  of  the  short  half-life  of  this  drug  in  the  body  and
the  low  afﬁnity  of  ketamine  for  NMDA  receptors.  Moreover,  this
neurotoxicity  is  likely  limited  to  very  young  patients  [69,70] .
7.7.  Precautions  for  ketamine  use
Considering  about  the  adverse  reactions  stated  above,  precau-
tions  should  be  considered  during  ketamine  use.  Due  to  the
excitatory  effects  of  ketamine  on  the  central  nervous  system,  the
Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  recommends  that  ketamine
use  be  contraindicated  in  patients  with  severe  hypertension  and  in
patients  who  are  allergic  to  ketamine.  Patients  with  coronary  heart
disease,  heart  failure,  glaucoma,  atherosclerosis,  pulmonary  heart
disease,  pulmonary  hypertension,  severe  intracranial  hyperten-
sion,  pregnancy,  a  history  of  mental  illness,  hyperthyroidism,
tachyarrhythmia,  adrenal  pheochromocytoma,  and  alcoholism
should  receive  ketamine  with  caution  [71].  Additionally,  the
FDA  has  provided  the  following  recommendations  [71]:  (1)  slower
infusion  rates  and  gradual  increases  in  the  dosage  should  be
considered  because,  when  the  ketamine  administration  rate  or
dosage  is  too  high,  psychiatric  symptoms,  as  well  as  respiratory
depression  and  apnea,  are  more  likely  to  occur  during  recovery
from  anesthesia;  (2)  to  reduce  seizures  and  ketamine-induced
respiratory  depression,  mechanical  ventilation  should  be
employed  prior  to  ketamine  initiation,  and  vital  signs,  such  as
breathing  status  and  blood  pressure,  should  be  closely  monitored;
(3)  computed  tomography  should  be  performed  to  exclude  the
presence  of  intracranial  lesions  that  might  cause  intracranial
hypertension  before  the  selection  of  ketamine;  (4)  in  the  elderly,
the  minimum  possible  dose  of  ketamine  should  be  selected;  and
(5)  ketamine  might  increase  skeletal  muscle  tension  in  some
patients,  which  should  be  distinguished  from  tonic-clonic  seizures.
8.  Conclusions
Ketamine  is  a  noncompetitive  antagonist  of  glutamatergic
NMDA  receptors,  and  its  anticonvulsant  effects  have  previously
been  conﬁrmed.  Recent  studies  have  found  that,  during  prolonged
seizures,  the  numbers  and  activities  of  GABA  receptors  gradually
decrease;  thus,  the  commonly  used  ﬁrst-line  and  second-line  AEDs
gradually  fail.  Simultaneously,  the  numbers  and  activities  of
glutamatergic  NMDA  receptors  increase,  often  causing  RSE  and
thus  providing  the  possibility  of  the  use  of  ketamine  to  treat  RSE.Additionally,  ketamine  exerts  neuroprotective  effects  that  could
ameliorate  RSE-induced  neuronal  damage.  Therefore,  in  recent
years,  ketamine  has  become  increasingly  used  in  clinical  practice.
We  examined  many  clinical  studies  that  have  investigated  the
efﬁcacy  of  ketamine  in  the  treatment  of  RSE;  these  studies  included
multi-center,  retrospective  studies,  prospective  cohort  studies  and
case  reports.  In  addition,  the  results  of  an  evidence-based  clinical
study,  published  in  2014,  also  suggested  that  ketamine  might  be  of
potential  beneﬁt,  and  it  reported  low  adverse  reaction  rates  in  the
treatment  of  RSE  in  children  and  adults.  However,  to  the  best  of  our
knowledge,  no  controlled  studies  have  been  published  that  have
examined  the  efﬁcacy  and  safety  of  ketamine  for  the  treatment  of
RSE,  constituting  a  limitation  of  our  review.  However,  it  is  not
ethically  permissible  to  establish  randomized  controlled  trials  in
patients  with  RSE,  due  to  the  emergent  nature  and  high  mortality
of  this  disease  and  the  lack  of  effective  drugs  to  treat  RSE  to  use  as  a
control.  In  addition,  the  unpredictable  nature,  low  recruitment
rates,  and  relatively  low  incidence  rates  of  RSE  have  also  resulted  in
a  lack  of  large-sample-size  studies.  In  addition,  the  ﬁrst  planned
RCT  focusing  on  the  treatment  of  RSE  was  terminated  due  to
insufﬁcient  recruitment  [72].  Thus,  it  will  be  necessary  to  conduct
robust  prospective  studies  to  investigate  the  regimens,  efﬁcacy,
and  safety  of  ketamine  for  the  treatment  of  RSE.
