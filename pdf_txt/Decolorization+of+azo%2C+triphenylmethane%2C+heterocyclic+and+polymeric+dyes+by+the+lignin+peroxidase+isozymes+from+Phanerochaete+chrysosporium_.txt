1. Introduction
Syntheticdyesareextensivelyusedfortextiledyeing,
paperprinting,colourphotographyandasadditivesinpetroleumproducts.Duringthedyeingprocess,10–15%
ofdyeisdischargedintheeﬄuent.Approximatelyahalf
ofallknowndyesareazodyes,makingthemthelargestgroup ofsynthetic colourants. Azo dyes andtheir pig-ments are versatile and the most common syntheticcolourantsreleasedintotheenvironment.Theyarealsotypically amenable to structural modiﬁcation and rep-resentativeazodyescanbemadetobindmostsyntheticand natural textile ﬁbers. Approximately 10,000 dif-
ferent dyes and pigments are used for industries and
over 7 /C210
5tons of these dyes are annually produced
worldwide(Zollinger,1987).
Several amino-substituted azo dyes including 4-phe-
nylazoaniline and N-methyl- and N,N-dimethyl-4-phenylazo anilines are mutagenic as well as carcino-
genic.Inmammals,azodyesarereducedtoarylaminesby cytochrome p450 and a ﬂavin-dependent cytosolicreductase (Fujita and Peisach, 1977). Microbial deco-lourization has been proposed as a less expensive and
less environmentaly intrusive alternative. Various bac-
teria and fungi have decolourizing abilities and an ex-tensive review of microbiological decolourization isavailable(Glenn andGold,1983).Atpresentdecolou-rization of various kinds of azo dyes by various fungihas been reported (Bumpus et al., 1988; Cripps et al.,1990;Raﬁietal.,1990;Paszezynskietal.,1991).Colleenet al. (1990) demonstrated the degradation of azo and
heterocyclic dyes of orange II, tropeolin O, congo red
and azure B by Phanerochaete chrysosporium . The
degradation of azo, anthraquinone, heterocyclic, tri-phenylmethaneandpolymericdyesby P. chrysosporium
has been intensively studied (Bumpus et al., 1988;Crippsetal.,1990;KlingandNeto,1991;Ollikkaetal.,1993).

acidgreen27,acidviolet7andindigocarminedyesonliving and dead mycelia of Trametes versicolor . Also,
enzymes such as lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganesedependent peroxidase (MnP) and laccase, all of whichare involved in lignin degradation, have been reportedtodecolorizedyes(VyasandMolitoris,1995).Dyeswithdiﬀerentstructuresaredecolourizedatdiﬀerentintrinsic
enzymatic rates and high dye concentration results in
the slower decolourization rate. Kim et al. (1996) de-monstrated the presence of H
2O2-dependent enzyme
activity decolourizing remazol brilliant blue Rin theculture ﬁltrate of Pleurotus ostreatus in a chemically
deﬁned medium. Young and Yu (1997) suggested thebindingofdyestothefungalhyphae,physicaladsorp-tion and enzymatic degradation by extracellular and
intracellularenzymesasmajormechanismsforthecol-
ourremoval.Asaresultofthestudiesonthephysicalsorptionandtheenzymaticdegradationoftheadsorbeddye molecules, the enzymatic degradation of adsorbeddyes has been regarded as a major mechanism in theregeneration of dye adsorption capacity of the myce-lium.
Kim and Shoda (1999) have puriﬁed and character-
ized the novel peroxidase(Dyp) that is responsible for
the dye-decolourizing acitivty of Geotrichum candidum
Dec1.Nineofthe21typesofdyesweredecolourizedbyDec1andinparticularanthroquinonedyeswerehighlydecolourised.SwamyandRamsay(1999)reportedthatinthewhiterotfungus, Trametes versicolor ,ligninper-
oxidase(LiP)wasnotdetectedduringdecolourizationoftheazodyeofamaranth,whilelaccaseandmanganese
peroxidase (MnP) were detected in the decolourizing
cultures. A white rot fungus, Thelephorasp., was iso-
lated from the Western Ghats of South India andcharacterized for its ligninolytic enzymes (Selvam,2000), but no studies have been conducted yet onthe biotechnological applications of this fungus todecolourization of azo dyes. In the present study, thefeasibilityofusing Thelephorasp.forazodyedecolouri-
zation and colour removal from a dye industry eﬄuent
wasexamined.
2. Methods
2.1. Microorganism and media
Thelephorasp. was isolated from stumps ofa burnt
treeintheWesternGhatsregion ofTamilnadu, India.The fungus was identiﬁed based on the keys providedpreviously (Bakshi, 1971; Gilbertson and Ryvarden,1986). Fungal growth was cut out, sterilized with 1%
mercuric chloride solution, repeatedly washed with
sterile distilled water as described previously (Watling,1971) and inoculated on 2% malt agar medium. Thefungalgrowthonaplatewassub-culturedfor6daysat
37/C176C and maintained on malt agar slants. Then, the
spores were harvested without disturbing the mycelialgrowthusingacamelhairbrushandﬁlter-sterilized.Thespore concentration was adjusted to 10
5spores/ml
and used as an inoculum for further studies. Growthkinetics, the ligninolytic enzyme production, and dyedecolourizationstudieswerecarriedoutinaC-limited
medium (M14) of Janshekar and Fiechter (1988), to
which spores in the one-tenth volume of the mediumwereinoculated.
2.2. Ligninolytic enzyme production
Enzymes,ligninperoxidase(LiP),manganese-depen-
dent peroxidase (MnP) and laccase were puriﬁed fromthe culture ﬁltrate by acetone precipitation (66% v/v)andSephadexG-100columnchromatography.TheLiP
activity was determined using a spectrophotometer ac-
cording to the method of Linko (1988). One unit ofenzyme activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzymeoxidizingone lmoleofveratrylalcoholin1min.MnP
was assayedusing aspectrophotometerbythe methodofKuwaharaetal.(1984).Oneunitofenzymeactivitywasexpressedastheamountofenzyme capableofin-creasing oneopticaldensity(OD)at610nminamin.
The laccase activity was determined spectrophotomet-
ricallyasdescribedbyEvans(1985)withguaiacolasasubstrate. In this case, one unit of the enzyme activitywasexpressedastheamountofenzymeabletoincreaseoneODat440nm.
2.3. Decolourization of azo dyes
The ability of the fungus to degrade the azo dyes,
orangeG,congored,andamidoblack10Bwasstudied
inC-limitedmedium.Fungalspore(10
5spores/ml)was
inoculatedandincubatedat30 /C176Cfor6daysinanor-
bitalshaker.After6days,adye(orangeG-50 lM/congo
red-50 lM/amido black 10B-25 lM) was added. Sam-
ples were withdrawn at regular time intervals and ﬁl-tered,andtheODoftheclearﬁltratewasmeasuredat479,497and618nm,respectively,fororangeG,congo
red and amido black 10B. For enzyme treatment, the
reaction mixture containing 90 ml of dye at variousconcentrations was incubated with various concentra-tions(5,10and15U/mlasaﬁnalconcentration)ofLiP,MnP (in sodium succinate buﬀer, 20 mM; pH 4.5) orlaccase (in phosphate buﬀer, 0.1 M; pH 7). At regulartimeintervals,thesampleswerewithdrawnandtheODwasmeasured.
2.4. Decolourization of textile dye eﬄuent
To analyse the eﬃciency of treatment of a dye in-
dustry eﬄuent, two modes of treatment were adopted,116 K. Selvam et al. / Bioresource Technology 88 (2003) 115–119since diﬀerent modes can show diﬀerent eﬃciencies in
thetreatment.Theabilityofthefungustoremovecol-ourfromadyeingindustryeﬄuentwasassayedinthemodiﬁed C-limited medium (Janshekar and Fiechter,1988). The medium contained the textile dye eﬄuentinsteadofdistilledwaterinequalvolume.ThepHofthesolution was adjusted to 4.5. To the eﬄuent-amendedmedium(950ml),50mlofsporesuspension(10
5spore/
ml) was inoculated and maintained at 39 /C176C. Samples
were withdrawn at regular time intervals and analysedforcolourremoval.Theintensityofeﬄuentcolourwasmeasuredat490nm.Forenzymetreatment,thereactionmixture containing 90 ml of the eﬄuent, various con-centrations(5,10and15U/mlasaﬁnalconcentration)of LiP, MnP (in sodium succinate buﬀer, 20 mM; pH4.5) and laccase (in phosphate buﬀer, 0.1 M; pH 7.0)
were added. The reactionmixturewas incubatedat37
/C176Cfor1h.After1h,thecolourintensityoftheeﬄuent
wasmeasured.Boiledenzymewasusedasacontrol.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Decolourization of azo dyes by mycelia
Thegrowthanddecolourizationeﬃciencyofthetest
fungus is shown in Table 1. It was observed that
Thelephorasp. was able to decolourize only 33.3% of
orangeGwithin9days,whereascongoredwasremovedupto97.1%within8handamidoblack10Bupto98.8%in 24 h. White rot fungi are the only microorganismsknown to be capable of complete mineralization oflignocellulosic polymers. Cripps et al. (1990) reportedthatP. chrysosporium couldremove 87–93%oforange
11,tropeolinOandcongoredwithinﬁvedays.Spadaroet al. (1992) established that P. chrysosporium was ca-
pableofmineralizingavarietyoftoxicazodyesandthemineralization of aromatic rings of azo dyes was de-pendent on the nature of ring substituents. Heinﬂinget al. (1997) reported that Bjerkandera adusta andT.
versicolorremoved95%ofHRB8dyeswithinfourdays.
When compared with these results, the newly isolated
Thelephorasp. has a superior potential to decolourize
someazodyessuchascongoredoramidoblack10B.

3.3. Treatment of a dye industry eﬄuent in two modes
In the study on the treatment of a dye industry ef-
ﬂuent,myceliaof Thelephorasp.removed61%ofcolour
in a batch mode from the eﬄuent on the third day of
incubationwhereasinacontinuousmodeonlyamaxi-
mum of 50% on the seventh day (Fig. 2). The enzymelaccaseat15U/mlconcentrationremoved15%ofcolour(Fig. 3). Sayadi and Ellouz (1993) reported a positiverole for veratryl alcohol with lignin peroxidase in de-colourization ofolive millwaste water by a P. chryso-
sporiumculture. Wang and Yu (1998) reported that
adsorptionanddegradationofdyemoleculesonlivingfungalhyphaemightprovideamechanismforafeasibleapplicationofwhiterotfungiincontinuoustreatmentofan industrial eﬄuent. Rodriguez et al. (1999) reportedthat several industrial dyes were decolourized biocata-lyticallybyextracellularenzymes.Bothmycelium and
puriﬁed enzymes of Thelephorasp. were able to deco-
lourize the azo dyes. Mycelia of the test fungus eﬀec-tively removed 61% of the dyes, which was obtainedunderconditionsnotoptimizedforazodyedegradationandcolourremoval.Therefore,thereisapotentialap-plication inthe biologicaltreatment ofindustrialeﬄu-entscontaminatedwithazodyes.
