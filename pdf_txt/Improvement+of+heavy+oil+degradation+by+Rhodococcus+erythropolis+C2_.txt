 ABSTRACT  
The biodegradation of sites co -contaminated by organic pollutants and Heavy Metals 
is often a challenge due to the inhibition of microbial activities.  Microbes play 
important role in the mineralization of petroleum hydro carbons to CO 2 by utilizing 
petroleum hydro carbons as a carbon/ energy source. Heavy metals are often 
constituents of petroleum. Petroleum spills may result to the release associated 
meta ls (e.g. Ni, Cd, Pb, As) into the environment. Subsequent spills may cause an 
increase in metal concentrations in soils that may build to concentrations above 
intervention values. This may result to the inhibition of important biological activities 
such as  the biodegradation of organic contaminants. This research investigates the 
effects of Ni , Cd and Pb contamination on biodegradation of petroleum hydro carbons 
in complex soil system  using a microbiological approach combined with geochemical 
approach.  Such an approach will provide a more detailed understanding of the 
patterns of oil degradation under different and increasing metal stresses and how 
microbial communities change in such environments . Results indicated that Ni  has 
stimulatory or no effects  on biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soils  
depending on the chemical form of added Ni.  The stimulatory effect  was observed in 
Ni-Porphyrin contaminated soils and declined with increasing Ni concentration . In NiO 
soils, no effects occurred at low conce ntrations and increased concentration of Ni 
resulted to increased inhibition of biodegradation . This is unlike NiCl 2 amended soils 
where Ni effects on biodegradation were neutral irrespective of Ni concentration.  The 
microbial diversity study of the micro bial soil community indicated that there was a 
selective enrichment of species in the soil communities. Phylogenetic study indicated 
that the dominant microorganism in the community is a strain of Rhodococcus  (100%),  
which was closely related to most Rhodo coccus  strains isolated from hydrocarbon -
contaminated environments, metal contaminated environments and extreme 
environments. Results indicated that Cd inhibited biodegradation of crude oil in soils, 
irrespective of Cd form or concentrations. The inhibitor y effect increased with 
increasing concentrations. Also,  the microbial diversity study of the microbial soil 
community indicated that there was a selective enrichment of species in the soil 
communities. Similar to Ni, Phylogenetic study indicated that the dominant 
microorganism in the community is a strain of Rhodococcu s. Also biodegradation of iv 
 petroleum was significantly reduced in crude oil degrading short -term Pb 
contaminated soils, irrespective of Pb form or concentration. However, in long -term 
Pb conta minated soils, while maximal rate of petroleum degradation reduced at high -
Pb concentration, no effect was observed at low lead concentration. Also, the 
microbial diversity study of the microbial soil community indicated that there was a 
selective enrichme nt of species in the soil communities. Two dominating specie were 
identified in Pb -soils depending on soil. Both are closely related to a strain belonging 
to Bacillales  that were originally isolated Rock, Scopulibacillus  darangshiensis  strain  
(98%) and oil  contaminated soil Bacillus circulans  (99%) . While the former dominated 
in Pb -short -term contaminated soils as well as Pb -long term contaminated soil at high 
concentration, the later dominated long -term -Pb contaminated soil at low 
concentration.

  1 Chapter 1: Literature review  
 
1.1 Introduction  
The petroleum industry is a major contributor of pollutants in the world. This 
contribution is due to the increased global demand for petroleum as a major source of 
energy and the diverse locations that oil is  recovered from and transported too. In fact, 
the estimated global demand for crude oil is about 83.1 million barrels per day and is 
expected to increase to 106 million barrels per day by 2030 (OPEC 2009). To meet 
this demand, there is increased activity i n the upstream, midstream and downstream 
sectors of the petroleum industry with associated deliberate,  and accidental oil spills, 
tanker and pipeline leakages that release crude oil into the environment across the 
globe. The clean up of the released hydroc arbon becomes essential to avoid 
environmental and health hazards that can be caused by the petroleum constituents.  
 
Over the years, different physical, chemical,  and biological techniques have been 
established for the remediation of polluted sites.  Biore mediation has been of great 
interest as it is cost effective, efficient,  and eco -friendly. The indigenous 
microorganisms of the polluted sites are harnessed during the  bioremediation of the 
polluted sites. This is achieved by  improving the nutrient status to stimulate  these 
organisms or improve the  abiotic conditions (biostimulation)  (Rothwell and Cooke 
2015). However, the addition laboratory -cultured microbes that are commercially 
available at an appropriate scale to increase the population of hydrocarbon degrading 
microbes enhances has been considered (bioaugmentation ) (Rothwell and Cooke 
2015).  
 
In polluted soils, different factors influence the microbial degradation of petroleum 
hydrocarbons.  The key factors that affect biodegradation of petroleum are t he 
presence of a microbial population (the species and the population size) capable of 
degrading the oil components and the ability of the environment to sustain their 
activity.  In addition to these key environmental factors the composition of the oil 
itself is important and the presence of co -contaminants. For instance, heavy metals are 
one the numerous constituents of complex crude petroleum. Some of the identified 
heavy metals associated with Crude oil include Nickel, Iron, copper , Zinc , Lead, 
Vanadium,  Cobalt, Cadmium, Chromium etc. (Abioye 2011; Coleman 2002; Freije 
2014). These heavy metals can be toxic to living organisms. However, some of them  2 such as iron, zinc and selenium are essential to metabolic activities. Critically, these 
elements cannot be  degraded by microbes and as a result, tend to accumulate in 
chronic petroleum polluted soils ( Freije 2014; Fu and Zang 2014; Muniz et al. 2004).  
 
Investigations to determine the effect of heavy metals on petroleum degradation by 
microbes are necessary to  enhance the bioremediation of sites co -contaminated by 
heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbon. The existences of co -contaminated sites 
have been reported in previous studies carried out on petroleum -contaminated sites 
across the globe (see table 1.1). For  instance, studies by De Mora et al. (2004) 
identified contamination of sediments by Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn in Bahrain and Co, Cr and 
Ni in United Arab Emirate (UAE) due to the chronic oil spills (they also identified 
bioaccumulation of metals in aquatic life). Th is thesis describes a series of systematic 
experiments, which have rigorously investigated the effect of the heavy metals Ni, Cd 
and Pb in terms of their concentration and chemical association, on the biodegradation 
of petroleum hydrocarbon in soil. This s ystematic approach has been coupled to a 
rigorous analysis of the experimental system from the multiple perspectives of the 
diversity and abundance of the soil microbial community (specifically the 
hydrocarbon degraders), the chemical fate of the added met als and the compositional 
change of the crude petroleum pollutant.  
 
1. 2. Research Justification  
The importance of oil spills and its impact have been well acknowledged globally. 
Investigations on the impact to human health, terrestrial and aquatic enviro nments are 
well documented Taylor and Rasheed 2011; Dubinsky et al. 2013; Arias et al. 2010; 
UNEP 2011; Ite et al. 2013). However, the emphasis of these studies is mostly on the 
major components of the oils. Little is known about the impact of the minute b ut 
effective heavy metal concentrations in the environments. Investigating the impact of 
metals on biodegradation of petroleum may result to the development of more 
effective and less time -consuming remediation methods for the restoration of 
contaminated e nvironments. Hence, establishing the thresholds that can be tolerated in 
soil systems with respect to metal types, mineral form, and levels, where 
bioremediation can still be relied on, becomes important in predicting effective 
remediation in regions where  the chronic repeat of oil spills result in metal 
accumulation in the soils. Also, the results of this work could be helpful in making 
decisions on the reliability of the indigenous community in a typical soil to provide a  3 hydrocarbon -degrading community, which is adaptable to the different metal 
concentrations that might occur or the need to augment the hydrocarbon degraders 
with those that have metal tolerances (engineered or obtained from somewhere) in 
cases where indigenous community of soil lacks metal  tolerating hydrocarbon 
degraders

Note: the heavy metals reported here are Pb, Cd and Ni, which are the metals of interest in the project  4 Furthermore, investigations on the impact of heavy metals and the biodegradation of 
petroleum hydrocarbons based on individual microorganisms and individual 
hydrocarbon components are well established (Sokhn et al. 2001; Nakatsu et al. 2005; 
Olaniran et al. 2013; Riis et al. 2002). Nakatsu et al. (2005) investigated the impact of 
heavy metals (Pb and Cr) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons addition to soil on the soil 
microbial community structure in soil microcosms. Studies on a simulated 
environment in microcosms are more likely to determine a real wor ld scenario 
resulting to the development of a more realistic approach for effective petroleum 
hydrocarbon removal in the environment. This provides an avenue to understanding 
the complex environment of mixed pollutants better by assessing the fate of both 
hydrocarbon and heavy metals as well as the dynamics of the microbial community. 
Also, Simulation of environments in microcosms were used in the past by researchers 
to investigate biodegradation of crude oil in various environments including soils, 
sedimen ts, aquatic environments e. t. c. (Röling et al. 2002; Taylor et al. 2008; Okoh 
2003; ChaIneau et al. 1995; Singh et al. 2014; Hubert et al. 2012; Gray et al. 2011; 
Sherry et al. 2013; Sung et al. 2013; Salanitro et al. 1997) and this has provided a 
more r ealistic understanding of crude oil degradation in complex environments.  
 
1.3. Aim  
The general aim of this project is to investigate metal effects on hydrocarbon 
degradation in complex natural systems using microbial ecological approach 
combined with rigo rous analysis of the fate of individual hydrocarbon components 
and heavy metals during the degradation of whole oils. Such an approach will provide 
a more detailed understanding of the patterns of oil degradation under different and 
increasing metal stress es and how microbial communities progressively change in 
such environments.  
 
1.4 Research Questions  
1. Do the concentrations of heavy metals in the soils contaminated with petroleum 
hydrocarbon influence the biodegradability of the hydrocarbon pollutants an d 
critically at what threshold concentrations are these effects observable?  
2. How do the chemical forms of the metals as added to the soil influence the 
response of hydrocarbon biodegrading community?  
3. How does the pollutant aging i.e. the ultimate chemical fate of the added metal 
correlate with impacts on hydrocarbon degradation?   5 4. Do the dominant hydrocarbon degraders within a typical soil vary as a function 
metal type and concentration or do the dominant hydrocarbon degraders display a 
broad tolerance to met al concentrations  
5. Will biodegradation of crude of petroleum hydrocarbons occur in an environment 
that has experienced a long -term exposure to heavy metals and if so are the 
resultant microbial communities similar or distinct to those of pristine soils 
incubated with similar levels of metal and hydrocarbon?  
 
1.5. Hypotheses  
1. Heavy  metals , irrespective of concentration and added forms, will inhibit the 
degradation of petroleum  hydrocarbon.  
2. The presence of heavy metals in soil systems will limit the prol iferation of 
hydrocarbon degraders to only heavy metal resistance strains of the microbes and this 
will change the microbial diversity of the soil systems in relation to oil only amended 
soil and unamended soil controls.  
 
1.6. Objectives  
1. To determine the effect of different concentrations of heavy metals (Ni, Cd 
and Pb) on the rate of biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil 
microcosms through the monitoring of CO 2 production.  
2. To determine the effect of metals on the biodegradation of petroleum 
hydrocarbon as a function of their chemical form (i.e. organically complexed 
and soluble and insoluble inorganic forms by monitoring the CO 2 production 
in soil microcosms.  
3. To determine the chemical fate of the added metals in a petroleum 
hydrocarbon contamina ted soil system by sequential extraction analysis of 
metal partitioning into different soil fractions.  
4. To corroborate estimates of degradation by CO 2 production by identifying and 
quantifying individual n -alkanes recovered from microcosms by solvent 
extrac tion after incubation.  
To determine (using molecular biological techniques) microbial community dynamics 
and, more specifically, hydrocarbon degrader abundances in the experimental system 
as a function of metal and oil addition.  
 
  6 1.7. Thesis structure  
There are 7 chapters in this thesis. Chapter 1 introduces the project by outlining the 
aims, objectives,  and scope of the project as well as providing a review of the relevant 
literature. Chapter 2 describes the methods used in this project, which include bo th the 
varied molecular microbiological techniques employed and the inorganic and organic 
geochemical analytical techniques. The multidisciplinary approach described in this 
second chapter was chosen to provide a broader understanding of biodegradation in 
metal -petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil systems. In Chapters 3 the design and 
application of specific quantitative Polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays are 
described, which the 16S rRNA gene sequences of important taxonomic groups 
identified in co mmunity diversity studies. The main results chapters for this study 
encompass chapters 4 , 5 and 6. In these chapters, the effects of the heavy metals Ni, 
Cd and Pb on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon are respectively discussed. 
Chapter 7 conclud es the project thesis outlining the important deductions, general 
themes and key differences and similarities between the respective study systems with 
recommendations for future work.  
 
1.8.    Components and classification of Petroleum  
Petroleum is a comp lex mixture of hydrocarbon compounds. Previous studies have 
established that petroleum consists of more than 17,000 distinct chemical compounds 
(Head et al. 2006). These chemical compounds are dominated by hydrocarbons 
classified as either saturates, aroma tics, resins and asphaltenes collectively described 
as the SARAs (Fingas 2015; Peters et al. 2007a; Jokuty et al. 1995; B.P. Tissot and 
Welte 2013a). In addition to these bulk hydrocarbon components, there are other 
minor constituents. These include sulphu r, nitrogen, oxygen and metals (Peters et al. 
2007; Tissot and Welte 2013a). The variety of compounds comes from the complex 
biological structures from  which oil originally originates (B.P. Tissot and Welte 
2013b). Also, a variation of crude oil components  is determined by the different 
depositional environments , in which organic matter is preserved and altered to form 
oil (B.P. Tissot and Welte 2013b). Oil may be further altered during its generation and 
migration from the source rocks and can even be alte red by biological activity once 
emplaced within an oil reservoir (B.P. Tissot and Welte 2013b). Geologists and 
geochemists classify crude oil base in the chemical composition (B P Tissot and 
Welte 2013c). For instance based on hydrocarbon composition, petr oleum is classified 
as paraffinic or naphthenic crude oils (Simanzhenkov and Idem 2003; Sivasankar  7 2008; B P Tissot and Welte 2013c). Paraffinic crude oils consist of a high percentage 
of saturates while naphthenic oils consist of the high percentage of ar omatics and 
cyclic aliphatic (Simanzhenkov and Idem 2003). Apart from this base classification, 
the non -hydrocarbon components of petroleum are also considered while classifying 
petroleum.  Thus, the sulphur, nitrogen content and the ratios of the heavy me tals 
Vanadium and Nickel  (the most abundant trace metals in crude oil) have been used to 
classify petroleum (Peters et al. 2007a). The sulphur content of petroleum classifies 
petroleum as sweet of sour oil (Carrales and Martin 1975; Peters et al. 2007b; 
International Council on Clean Transportion 2011). Sweet oils have sulphur contents 
less than 1% of the whole petroleum by weight and sour oils have sulphur contents 
above this value. The physical attribute of petroleum that has been most exploited 
from an economic perspective is its classification in terms of lightness and heaviness 
called the American petroleum institute (API) gravity (Barwise 1990a; Speight and 
Ozum 2001).  API gravity is related to density and specific gravity and usually, the 
API of oil s range from 10o API (for heavy oil and bitumen with a specific gravity of 
over 1.0) to 45.3.3o API (for light oils with the specific gravity of about 0.8) (Speight 
and Ozum 2001). API values and the chemical properties have been correlated in the 
past in an attempt to classify petroleum based on the source rocks from which they 
were generated (Barwise 1990a).  
 
1.9    Heavy metals as components of petroleum  
It has been established in the section above that crude oils vary based on their 
constituents. All cr ude oils also consist of trace metals. As described above for the 
variance of bulk oil compositions the existence of metals in petroleum has been 
attributed to naturally occurring geochemical processes involved in the generation (in 
source rock), migration  (to the reservoir) and maturation (in the reservoir) of 
petroleum (Filby 1994). These processes expose the organic material to metal -rich 
surfaces and fluids (e.g. formation waters). As a result, these processes give rise to 
differences in abundances of t he total and specific metals which occur in different 
crude oils and the abundance of metals in the oils depends the depositional 
environment, the nature of the organic material in the source rock, the geological 
settings, the maturity of oil, the digeneti c history of the rock and the chemical 
composition it the oil (B.P. Tissot and Welte 2013b). As an example table, 1.2 
indicates the differences in the average concentrations of Ni, Cd, and Pb in crude oil  8 samples from around the world. This data emphasises  the highly varied compositions 
that occur.   
 
Metals in petroleum exist in different physical states and chemical forms. In the 
physical state, they exist as suspended solid particles, colloidal and liquid states 
(Karchmer and Gunn 1952). In chemical form s, they exist as organometallic 
complexes and inorganic forms including elemental form and as carbonates, sulphides, 
oxides, phosphates and chlorides (Filby 1994; Barwise 1990b; Anon n.d.; B.P. Tissot 
and Welte 2013b) .

  9 The organometallics in petroleum are considered as either metalloporphyrins or non -
porphyrins (Filby 1994; Peters et al. 2007a). Metalloporphyrins are the most common 
form  in which metals are known to exist in petroleum and they occur mostly in the 
asphaltic fraction of the petroleum. These compounds are believed to have originated 
biologically with chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll as the precursor (Peters et al. 
2007a; B.P. Tissot and Welte 2013b). Just like chlorophyll and other naturally 
occurring porphyrins, the structure consists of four pyrrole molecules but the 
magnesium in chlorophyll is substituted mostly by nickel and vanadium among other 
metals during the early  diagenesis of source rock (Filby 1994; Peters et al. 2007a). 
Because of their frequent occurrence, Nickel and Vanadyl porphyrins have been used 
as biomarkers in the geo chemistry of petroleum for oil -oil or oil -source rock 
correlation, identification of de positional environment of source rocks and in the 
determination of thermal maturity levels of oils or source rocks (Filby 1994; Peters et 
al. 2007).  
 
1.10 Remediation strategies for hydrocarbon polluted soils  
Ensuring environmental sustainability is one of  the priorities of the international 
community for over a decade (UNEP 2010). Pollution control and management has 
become a preeminent issue in many countries around the world. Consequently, 
various remediation strategies have been considered by academic s tudies, which 
include physical, chemical and biological methods or combinations of these (Semple 
2001; Riser -Roberts 1998).  
 
Physical and chemical techniques for soil remediation are strategies developed based 
on the physical and chemical properties of the  contaminants and the contaminated 
media.  The density, viscosity, physical state, solubility and volatility of the 
contaminants and contaminated media are exploited for physical remediation 
techniques while chemicals are often used to convert contaminants  into a less harmful 
form. The techniques could be in-situ or ex-situ. Some of these methods have been 
used successfully in the fields to decontaminate the environment (Abioye 2011; Riser -
Roberts 1998; U.S. EPA 2006; Stegmann et al. 2013). Some of the phys ical 
remediation methods include thermal treatment (involves the heating of soil to 
temperature less than 600 oC (Jensen and Miller, 1994 to increase the vapour pressure 
of organic contaminant thereby changing the contaminant to its gaseous form), air 
sparging, soil washing, chemical extraction (surfactants or solvent washing),  10 volatilization, steam extraction, solidification/stabilization and encapsulation (Riser -
Roberts 1998; Soleimani 2014; Abioye 2011). Usually, the remediation of 
contaminants, in-situ or ex-situ, using physical methods requires the containment of 
the contaminants thereby limiting their further migration (Wong et al. 1997; Friend 
1996; Naidu et al. 1996). This means that the contaminants are not quite removed 
completely from the environm ent. In the same vain, the chemical techniques that 
involve the addition of chemicals to convert the contaminant to a less harmful form 
might generate a more toxic contaminant that could be harmful to the environment. 
Also, the chemicals usually used to ac hieve decontamination may become more toxic 
to the environment (Mohanty et al. 2013; Makkar and Rockne 2003; Holly K. Ober 
2010; U.S. EPA 2010a; U.S. EPA 2010b). For instance, US EPA (2010a; 2010b) 
reported that the combination of Louisiana sweet crude oil  with 8 chemical 
dispersants used for the remediation of Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of 
Mexico was more toxic to the aquatic wide life than the crude oil alone.  
 
Bioremediation is a biological technique that exploits biological systems such as  
plants and microorganisms and their products to remediate the contaminated 
environment. Usually, microorganisms utilise organic contaminants as carbon sources 
and energy (Atlas, 1995; Thapa et al., 2012) and thus a complete mineralization of 
such organic compounds to the simplest compound CO 2 is achieved.  This process 
therefore effectively removes the organic contaminants from the environment.  For 
heavy metal contaminated environments, the most successful strategy of 
bioremediation is the use of plants a nd phytoplanktons that hyperaccumulate the 
metals within thereby removing them completely from the media of contamination 
(Rengifo -Gallego and Salamanca 2015; Göhre and Paszkowski 2006; Pulford and 
Watson 2003; Chekroun and Baghour 2013; Tangahu et al. 201 1; Pilon -Smits 2005).  
Apart from its effective removal of contaminants (R.M. Atlas 1995; Vidali 2001; Das 
and Chandran 2011). Atlas (1995) pointed out that it required less than $1 million to 
clean up the shorelines of Prince William Sound, Alaska using a  bioremediation 
technique which is in contrast to the use of physical sand washing which required $1 
million a day. Most importantly, bioremediation is considered to be the most 
environmentally friendly strategy for the remediation of contaminated environm ents. 
 
In contrast to the physical and chemical methods where the environment is 
destructively altered or harmful chemicals used for bioremediation the growth of  11 indigenous microorganisms is enhanced by careful consideration of favourable 
growth conditions  such as the pH, aeration, moisture, CNP ratios etc. to favour the 
most important microbial species that possesses the enzyme systems useful for the 
transformation of the contaminants. This concept is called biostimulation. 
Biostimulation has been used in remediation fieldwork in the past successfully. For 
instance, the addition of fertilizer to the Exxon Valdez spill site improved the rates of 
degradation of the petroleum hydrocarbons by 3 -5 times Atlas (1995). Some microbes 
enhance the degradation of hydr ocarbons by secreting biosurfactants (such as 
Rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas  species) that emulsify the hydrocarbons, breaking 
them into micelles. The exploitation of this fact was reported to be successful in the 
case of the Exxon Valdez spill (Bragg et al. 1994; Ronald M. Atlas 1995) and Deep 
Water Horizon Gulf of Mexico spill (Atlas and Hazen 2011).

Some microbes enhance the degradation of hydrocarbons by secreting biosurfactants 
(such as Rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas species ) that emulsify the hydrocarbons, 
breaking them into micelles. The exploitation of this fact was reported to be 
successful in the case of the Exxon Valdez spill (Bragg et al. 1994; Ronald M. Atlas  12 1995) and Deep Water Horizon gulf of Mexico spill (Atlas and Hazen 2011). In 
addition, the inoculation of appropriate microorganisms to the environment can 
enhance the remediation of the contaminated environment. This strategy is called 
Bioaugmentation  and has been used, alone or in combination with Biostimulation  
strategy, successful in bioremediation of petroleum -contaminated soils (Zhang et al. 
2008; Fan et al. 2013; Hua et al. 2010).  These concepts of bioremediation are eco -
friendly, as they do not involve destructive alteration of the environment and addition  
harmful substances to the environment (Head and Swannell 1999; Divya et al. 2015; 
Atlas and Bragg 2009). Table 1.3 compares the physical, chemical and biological 
strategies of remediation of contaminated sites.

The benefits assured by bioremediation techniques have heightened the interest of 
researchers in the field over the decades. Research work on the remediation of  13 contaminated sites by these strategies h as been well documented. Some of the cases 
where bioremediation techniques were utilized is highlighted on table 1.4.  
 
 
1.11.    Microbiology of Petroleum Biodegradation  
 
The hydrocarbon components of petroleum crude oils are readily degradable by 
microbes  (Prince 1997), however, the degradability of the individual components 
depends on the chemical structure and the chemical state of the component (Tyagi et 
al. 2011). The biodegradability of petroleum components decreases in the order n -
alkanes> branched a lkanes > branched alkenes> low -molecular weight n -alkyl 
aromatic > monoaromatics > cyclic alkanes > polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons >> 
asphaltenes (Tyagi et al., 2010; Das and Chandran, 2011). Though the n -alkanes are 
the most degradable, those with 5 -10 carbon atoms are inhibitory to degradation by 
most hydrocarbon degraders because they disrupt the lipid membrane of 
microorganisms (Bartha, 1986; Tyagi et al., 2010). Also, the hydrocarbons of 20 
carbon atoms to 40 carbon atoms (known as the waxes) have lo w degradability due to 
their hydrophobic nature (Bartha and Atlas, 1977, Tyagi et al., 2010).  
 
1.12.    Petroleum Hydrocarbon -degrading aerobic microorganisms  
Generally, petroleum hydrocarbon degraders possess the special ability to degrade 
hydrocarbons c omponents of petroleum by utilizing the hydrocarbons as the sole 
carbon sources releasing energy in the subsequent cleavage of the hydrocarbon chains. 
These organisms are found in all the domains of life including the Archaea, the 
bacteria and some eukaryo te such as fungi and algae.  So far, the recorded 
hydrocarbon degrading/transforming microorganisms include 79 bacterial genera, 9 
cyanobacterial genera, 103 fungal genera and 14 algal genera (Prince, 2005; Head et 
al., 2006). In fact, the ubiquity of thei r distribution in the terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems is such that they consist of approximately 1% the total microbial 
population (R.M. Atlas 1995). However, in the case of hydrocarbon release in the 
environment, there is usually a significant selectiv e enrichment of the hydrocarbon 
degraders (Leahy and Colwell 1990).  
 
Members of the bacterial phylogenetic groups Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, 
Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are frequently isolated in petroleum hydrocarbon  14 contaminated sites. Some of the m include species of Rhodococcus , Nocardia , 
Gordonia , Flavobacterium , Bacillus , Rhodobacter , Pseudomonas , Achromobacter , 
Alcaligenes , Sphingobaterium  and Burkholderia . Others, which are significantly 
enriched in the marine environment, include Alcanivorax  and Cycloclasticus  (Singh et 
al., 2009; Head et al., 2006). The table below documents some of the microbial 
isolates from petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated environments. Apart from 
bacterial, species, fungal species such as Aspergillus , Fusarium , Trichode rma and 
Penicillium  (Arutchelvi and Doble 2010; John et al. 2012; Michalcewicz 1995; 
Reyes -César et al. 2014; Elshafie et al. 2007) as well as acidophilic yeast species, 
Candida sp.  (Palittapongarnpim et al. 1998; Sood and Lal 2009; Prasad et al. 2005) 
have also been isolated from Petroleum contaminated sites.  
 
The dominance of the hydrocarbon degrading microbial population in petroleum -
contaminated ecosystems signifies their importance in the removal of organic 
pollutants in such environments. It has  been reported that hydrocarbon -degrading 
microbes interact, directly or indirectly, with each other and non -hydrocarbon 
degraders in the communities as well as the environmental factors in the petroleum 
degrading system (Head et al. 2006).  This is elaborated i n figure 1.2. A good 
example is the production of biosurfactants by microbes such as certain strains of 
Rhodococcus , Bacillus  and Pseudomonas  species, which emulsify the petroleum 
hydrocarbons, thereby reducing the surface tension of hydrocarbons and subse quently 
improving the bioavailability the hydrocarbon compounds for easy accessibility to 
members of the microbial communities. The importance of biosurfactant producers in 
bioremediation processes has been well documented (Iwabuchi et al. 2000; Ron and 
Rosenberg 2002; Gudiña et al. 2013; Ronald M. Atlas 1995; Colores et al. 2000). 
Another interactive relationship observed by Kanaly et al (2002) involves the role 
played by Rhodanobacter  isolated from a soil contaminated with benzo[a]pyrene. The 
microbe was observed to be able to grow on the metabolites produced by other 
members of the consortium and could not thrive individually in the presence of the 
hydrocarbon. Apart from interactive mutualistic cooperation, other ecological 
interactions that could be obs erved amongst members of the microbial community in 
a contaminated ecosystem may include competition for limiting nutrients, predation 
by protozoa and lysis by phage (See figure 1.2) (Head et al., 2006).  In addition, all 
these microbes interact with the e nvironment as well, hence, environmental factors  15 such as the physicochemical properties as well as chemical properties of the 
environment could contribute to biodegradation in the environment.

biodegradation involves more biological components than just the microorganisms that directly attack 
the oil (the primary oil degraders) and shows that the primary oil degraders in teract with these 
components. Oil -degrading bacteria are shown in green. Solid arrows indicate material fluxes, and 
broken arrows indicate direct interactions (for example, lysis by phage and predation by protozoa). For 
simplicity, only one function is ass igned to a microorganism in this schema. However, it should be 
noted that a microorganism can have more than one function or ability (for example, to weather 
minerals to release phosphate (P), and to degrade oil). It should also be noted that primary oil d egraders 
need to compete with other microorganisms for limiting nutrients (such as P) and that non -oil-
degrading microorganisms (shown in yellow) can be affected by metabolites and other compounds that 
are released by oil -degrading bacteria and vice versa

1.13.    The metabolic pathway of aerobic hydrocarbon degradation  
Due to its complex nature, the degradation of petroleum is a complex process that 
employs a series of enzymes systems. The mechanisms and  enzyme systems may vary 
according to the organism and petroleum component. However, the general 
degradation pathway for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation involves initial oxidation, 
which triggers the series of the various hydrocarbon conversions to Acety l-CoA. 
Acetyl -CoA is then channelled to the Kreb’s Cycle for energy generation (see figure 
1.3).  17  
The biodegradation of n -alkanes in bacteria starts with an initial terminal oxidation of 
the hydrocarbon by the alkane hydroxylase system to primary alcohols (Rojo 2010; 
Singh and Kumari 2012; Atlas 1981; Fritsche and Hofrichter 2008; Atlas and Bragg 
2009; Atlas and Hazen 2011; Ronald M. Atlas 1995; Atlas and Atlas 1991; Atlas 
1991; R.M. Atlas 1995). The primary alcohols are subsequently converted to the 
corres ponding aldehyde, which is then converted to fatty acids (see figure 1.4). In 
addition contrast to this terminal oxidation mechanism, alkane degradation in some 
organisms may involve the initial sub -terminal oxidation of an alkane to a secondary 
alcohol (s ee figure 1.4) (Rojo 2010; Singh and Kumari 2012; Atlas 1981; Fritsche and 
Hofrichter 2008). Subsequently, the secondary alcohol is converted to a ketone, 
followed by oxidation of the ketone to an ester, a reaction catalysed by the Baeyer -
Villiger monooxyg enase.  The ester is subsequently metabolised by esterase to 
primary alcohol and then to fatty acids. Generally, fatty acids are metabolised to 
Acetyl C oA through theβ -oxidation pathway and subsequently converted to CO 2 
through the Kreb’s -cycle (Rojo 2010; Singh and Kumari 2012; Atlas 1981; Fritsche 
and Hofrichter 2008). The metabolism of fatty acids may involve terminal ω -
hydroxylation at the  ω-position of the terminal methyl group resulting in the 
formation of dicarboxylic acid and subsequent conversion to Acetyl -CoA by β -
oxidation (Atlas 1981).  
 
Branched alkanes are more complex than the straight -chained n -alkanes. 
Consequently, the degradation of bran ched alkanes are more difficult and may involve 
the initial ω - and β -oxidation of hydrocarbon molecule (Kester and Foster 1963; Atlas 
1981).  
 
Cyclic alkanes, which are minor constituents of crude petroleum are less susceptible 
to microbial attack, basicall y due to the lack of exposed terminal methyl group. The 
degradation pathway of cyclohexane is illustrated in figure 1.5. Generally, the 
degradation of cycloalkanes starts with the hydroxylation of cycloalkane by a 
monooxygenase. This activation step is seq uentially followed by the dehydroxylation 
to a ketone by a dehydrogenase, conversion of the ketone to a lactone by insertion of 
oxygen into the ring by monooxygenase, hydrolysis of lactone catalysed by hydrolase 
and dehydrogenation to α - ω-dicarboxylate (N eilson and Allard 2007). The 
dicarboxylate undergoes further degradation by β -oxidation to acetyl -CoA, which is a  18 precursor for Kreb’s cycle for the complete degradation to CO 2 and H 2O. Substituted 
or unsubstituted Cycloalkanes are degraded by oxidative an d co-oxidative degradation 
(Atlas 1981). Microbes appear to attack substituted cycloalkanes, especially those 
with alkane substitutes, more readily than unsubstituted cycloalkanes (Atlas 1981). 
The substitute groups are first degraded leading to the format ion of cyclohexane 
carboxylic acid or related compound (Atlas 1981).

Aromatic hydrocarbons are the other major components of petroleum hydrocarbon but 
they are the most resistant to degradation due to their limited chemical reactivity 
(Gibson and Chapman 1971; Atlas 1981; S mith 1990; Fuchs et al. 2011). The 
classical aerobic degradation pathway of aromatics involves the initial attack by 
oxygenases to form compounds such as Catechol (1 , 2-dihydroxybenzene) in bacteria 
and Protocatechuate (3,  4 -dihydroxybenzoate) in most fun gi and some bacteria as 
central intermediates (Fuchs et al. 2011). Subsequently, central -ring cleavage occurs 
which is catalysed by ring -cleaving dioxygenases. The cleaved ring compounds are  19 then further degraded to intermediaries such as acetyl -CoA, succi nyl-CoA and 
pyruvate, which are metabolised to CO 2 or for biomass build up (Fuchs et al. 2011).

Biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons only occurs if microorganisms possess the 
appropriate enzyme systems (Atlas 1981; Singh and Kumari 2012; Fritsche and 
Hofrichter 2008). For the degradation of n -alkanes, depending on the carbon chain 
length, enzymes belonging to different families catalyse the initial hydroxylation 
(Rojo 2010; Singh and Kumari 2012). Microorganisms degrading short -chain -length 
alkanes (C 2–C4) have enzymes related to methane monooxygenases, such as the 
butane monooxygenase found in Pseudomonas butanovora  (Arp 1999; Rojo 2010) 
and propane monooxygenase in Gordonia sp.  TY-5 (Kotani et al. 2003; Rojo 2010). 
Strains degrading medium -chain -length alkanes (C 5–C11), or long -chain -length 
alkanes (>C 12), frequently c ontain integral membrane non -heme iron 
monooxygenases related to those ( AlkB  alkane hydroxylase) found in the well -
characterized hydrocarbon degrader Pseudomonas putida  GPo1. For instance, AlkMa 
and AlkMb are  found in Acinetobacter  sp. M1 (Tani et al. 2001 ; Rojo 2010). Some 
strains contain alkane hydroxylating enzymes that belong to a family of soluble 
cytochrome P -450s and that are active against C 5–C11 alkanes (Singh and Kumari 
2012; Rojo 2010). Recently, n -alkane hydroxylases that can catalyse the  20 hydrox ylation of long -chain n -alkanes and which are not related to the ones 
mentioned above have been identified and are currently being characterised (Rojo 
2010). An example of

such is the flavin binding monooxygenase, which was identified in long -chain n -
alkane assimilating Acinetobacter  strain DSM 17874 (Throne -Holst et al. 2007). 
Acinetobacter  strain DSM 17874 was able to assimilate n -alkanes C 20-C32 (Throne -
Holst et al. 2007). Interestingly, while some alkane degrading microbes possess one 
hydroxylase enzyme system e.g. GPo1 AlkB in P. putida , others possess multiple 
alkane hydroxylase enzyme systems, e. g  in Acinetobacter  M1, three enzyme systems, 
AlkMa  and AlkMb  that hydrolys es n-alkanes and a dioxygenase which hydrolyses 
long chain n -alkanes C10 -C30 (Rojo 2010; Maeng et al. 1996). As described above, 
the alcohol generated from the terminal oxidation of these n -alkanes is then converted 
to aldehydes (or ketones in the case of sub-terminal oxidation) by alcohol 
dehydrogenases (ADHs) (Rojo 2010; Singh and Kumari 2012; Atlas 1981). There are 
NADP+ dependent (Rojo 2010; M E Singer and Finnerty 1985; M. E. Singer and 
Finnerty 1985; Singer et al. 1985) and independent ADHs (Vangnai and Arp 2001; 
Sayavedra -Soto et al. 2001; Vangnai, Sayavedra -Soto, et al. 2002; Vangnai, Arp, et al. 
2002; Rojo 2010). The NADP+ dependent ADHs use NADP+ as an electron acceptor,  21 while NADP+ independent ADHs depend on other electron acceptors such as 
cytoch romes and ubiquinones and most contain pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as 
the prosthetic group (Rojo 2010). The aldehydes generated are usually metabolised to 
fatty acids by aldehyde dehydrogenases.  
1.14.    Metals - Microorganisms interaction  
Metals are ub iquitous in nature existing in different environments including the 
lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. Due to this ubiquity, metals and microbes 
interact with each other. While some metals are essential to microbial metabolic 
activities, others are c lassified as toxic. Microbes cannot degrade metals but they can 
biotransform them as survival mechanisms in metal -rich environments. 
Biotransformation processes often involve a variety of redox reactions (Borch et al. 
2010; Dynes et al. 2006; Boult et al. 2006; Gadd 2004). These mechanisms affect and 
are affected by important redox -driven biogeochemical cycles such as the C -, N- , P- 
and S -cycles (Gadd 2004). For instance: the oxidation and reduction of Fe by Fe -
oxidising and reducing bacteria, the oxidatio n and reduction of Mn by Mn -oxidising 
and reducing bacteria, sulphate reduction by sulphate reducing bacteria and sulphur 
oxidation by sulphur oxidising bacteria (Gadd , 2004). These transformations could 
influence the speciation (Duarte et al. 2008; Dynes et al. 2006), mobility (Gadd 2004; 
Boult et al. 2006), solubility (Gadd , 2004), bioavailability and toxicity of metals in the 
environment (Gadd, 2010). As a consequence, metals are either mobilised or 
immobilised. Mobilisation of metals can be achieved by protonation, chelation, and 
chemical transformation while immobilisation can occur by precipitation or 
crystallisation of insoluble organic or inorganic compounds or by sorption, uptake and 
intracellular sequestration (Gadd 2004). The importance of studyin g these interactions 
between microbes and metals has been acknowledged and there has been growing 
awareness of the natural process. In addition, the concept of metal microbial 
interaction has been incorporated into industrial strategies such as mining, 
remediation, and waste treatment e.t.c.  
The interaction between metal and microbes depends largely on the environmental 
factors such as metal -binding agents in the environment and presence of free ions.  
The pH of the environment determines the ability of hea vy metals to engagement in 
redox processes. Hence, pH largely influences the redox potential of metals. Metals 
are usually in their free ionic form in acidic conditions and can easily interact with  22 microbes. Most times, this interaction could result in a g reater toxic effect of metals 
on the microbes (The mechanism of metal toxicity to microbes is discussed in the next 
section). However, at high pH, the precipitation of such metals as oxides or 
hydroxides occurs. In this mineral form, metal bioavailability to microbes and 
mobility is reduced. The influence of pH on microbial metal interaction is applied in 
biomining activities, which involves the leaching of metals such as Fe in acidic 
condition facilitated by acidophilic microbes such as Sulfolobus   and the  oxidation of 
metals equally facilitated by bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus  ferroxidans  (Brune and 
Bayer 2012; Rawlings and Johnson 2007; Valenzuela et al. 2006; Jerez 2009). 
Furthermore , certain components of the environment bind strongly to metals 
immobilising the metals. For instance, in soil environments, organic materials such as 
Humic, acid and fulvic acid bind strongly to heavy metals reducing metal interaction 
with the biosphere including microbes (Gadd and Griffiths 1977). In addition to 
organic s, clays such as Kaolinite and Montmorillonite also absorb heavy metals 
thereby reducing the bioavailability to microbes. Binding agents also include 
chelating agents such as EDTA, citrates and amino acids such as cysteine and 
glutamate (Gadd and Griffiths  1977; Borch et al. 2010; Dynes et al. 2006; Poirier et al. 
2013; Harrison et al. 2007; Lemire et al. 2013). The secretion of amino -acids by 
microbes to immobilise metals is a mechanism of survival in a metal rich environment 
(Nies 2003; Dynes et al. 2006;  Huang and Liu 2013; Boult et al. 2006; Lemire et al. 
2013; Gadd 2004) and this is discussed in the next section.  Sometimes, metals bound 
to organics are not entirely inaccessible to microbes. For instance, siderophores, 
which are organic chelates that ha ve high affinity to Fe2+ facilitate the uptake of Fe2+ 
by microbes. Fe2+ is one of the essential metals for microbial metabolism, as a 
cofactor for enzymes. Sometimes, transportation of toxic metals, such as Cd, is 
facilitated (Lemire et al. 2013; Nies 200 3; Gadd and Griffiths 1977) by such chelation 
reactions. Apart from pH and binding agents, the free cations and anions in the 
environment can influence metal microbes interaction. The presence of anions such as 
OH-, PO42 -, S2O32 -, HCO3 - and CO32 - facilitat e the immobilisation of metals by 
precipitation, e.g. the immobilisation of uranium through the formation of phosphates  
(Jerden et al. 2003)  
1.15.    Mechanism of Metal toxicity to microbes  
Most heavy metals have no essential positive purpose to microbial  metabolic 
activities. However, certain metals are known to be essential for microbial  23 metabolism. Some of the essential metals include Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Ni, Mo, V, Cr. Li 
and B may be essential (Hughes and Poole, 1989, Bruins et al., 1999). It should be 
noted here that Ni listed here as being essential is one of those heavy metals which is 
found in oil and which is investigated in this study (See chapter 4).  These heavy 
metals although essential, could, however, become toxic at high concentration.  As, 
Ag, Cd, Hg, Pb, Ti, Al, Sn are considered non -essential and toxic to microbiological 
activities (Hughes and Poole, 1989, Bruins et al., 1999).  The essential and 
nonessential metals interact with each other and other essential cell components by 
chemical bondi ng, primarily ionic and covalent bonding (Bruins et al., 1999). At toxic 
concentration levels, metals could cause protein dysfunction, damage to the cell 
membrane and even DNA damage (Lemire et al; 2013(Bruins et al. 2000).  
Usually, metal toxicity involves  the accumulation of non -essential metals in the cells. 
Non-essential metals are usually similar in terms of their basic chemistry of the 
essential metals and thus, behave similarly. Most heavy metals exist in a divalent 
form and have ionic diameters of be tween 138 and 160 pm (Nies, 1999). Due to this 
close similarity, non -essential metals are transported into the cells using the same 
transport systems as the essential nutrients. These systems are described as ‘open 
gate’ systems due to their non -specificit y for ions (Nies 1999; Nies 2003; Nies 2000; 
Nies 1992; Gadd 2010; Bruins et al. 2000; Lemire et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2007). 
Metals are either transported directly or indirectly into the cells. The direct 
transportation of metals engages the transport  systems that do not require the 
alteration of metal cations. There is the energy independent General Bacterial Porin 
(GBP) transport system, which involves the direct transportation of metals in their 
free state across the cell envelopes (Nies 1999). It h as been documented that non -
essential metals are transported in certain bacterial strains and Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae by this transport system too. Furthermore, energy -dependent transport 
systems such as Zrt -and Irt -like protein (ZIP), Natural resistance associated 
macrophage protein (NRAMP), the ATP - binding Cassette (ABC) - type protein 
family and P -type ATPase transport families have been implicated in the 
bioaccumulation of non -essential metals in microbial (Nies, 1999, Nies 2000). The 
indirect transpor t systems involve the transport of metals bound to low -molecular -
mass ligands. Metals are usually co -transported binding to molecules such as organic 
acids, peptides, phosphates, amino acids, siderophores e.tc. (Lemire et al. 2013; Nies 
2003; Grass et al. 2005; Anton et al. 1999; Harrison et al. 2007). Some of the  24 transport systems are: the citrate -dependent FeCA transporter system, phosphates 
dependent transporters such as Pho84 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fristedt et al. 
1999; Bun -Ya et al. 1991) and Pit A in E. coli (Harris et al. 2001; Beard et al. 2000).  
Once the metals are transported into the cells, they incur toxicity resulting in cell 
malfunction, growth inhibition or even death (Lemire et al. 2013) . Mechanisms of 
metal toxicity have been proposed. One mechanism of toxicity of metals to microbial 
cells is to incur oxidative stress by causing increased levels of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) such as H 2O2 and superoxides (O2-) in cells. ROS are produced in cells through 
the process of autoxidation. Aut oxidation is the transfer of electrons from a reduced 
enzyme or cofactor to oxygen. This reaction is normally encountered in aerobic 
environments. Obligate and facultative microbes possess the enzyme systems; 
Catalase and superoxide dismutase; that elimina tes ROS in cells. However, the 
excessive production of ROS due to the excessive presence of electrons from donors 
may lead to excessive production of ROS due to the fact that the rate of production 
may supersede  the elimination rate. This, therefore, incur s oxidative stress on the cell. 
Essential metals, e.g. Ni and Fe, can be important in dealing with oxidative stress at 
low concentrations as cofactors for the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase 
but at high concentrations, these metals are available to engage in Fenton chemistry 
where they may lead to oxidative stress. Also, non -essential metals such as Cd and Pb 
have been reported to instigate oxidative stress in cells (Lushchak 2001; Cao et al. 
2012; Srivastava et al. 2014; Cabiscol et al. 2000; Dim kpa et al. 2009; Bussche and 
Soares 2011; Lushchak 2011; Lemire et al. 2013; Macomber and Hausinger 2011). 
Excessive ROS due to metals has been implicated in microbial cell DNA, protein and 
lipid damage (Lemire et al. 2013). Possibly, ROS accumulates in ce lls due to direct 
catalysis of autoxidation by metals, by indirect effect whereby certain metals disrupt 
the cellular donor ligand that coordinates Fe leading to the release of Fe into the cell 
cytoplasm thereby triggering off autoxidation or by the oxidat ion of thiols resulting in 
protein malfunction (Cabiscol et al. 2000; Harrison et al. 2007; Lemire et al. 2013). 
The oxidation of thiols, as a result of metal poisoning, results to the favourable 
covalent binding of proteins with metals and the formation o f disulphides. The 
consequence is the depletion of the antioxidants pool in the cell, particularly 
glutathione, and therefore increased ROS. Metals such as Cd, Cr, and As have been 
reported to exert toxicity by this mechanism (Cao et al. 2012; Srivastava e t al. 2014;  25 Lemire et al. 2013; Bussche and Soares 2011; Carcinogens 2011; Harrison et al. 
2007).  
 
Another mechanism of metal toxicity involves the substitution of essential metals in 
protein structures with non -essential metals resulting in the destructio n of the 
protein’s biological function. Certain proteins, metalloproteins, depend on essential 
metals such as Fe, Zn and Co for their structures and functions. The replacement of 
these metals could lead to the inactivation of proteins. For instance, the in activation of 
the Fe -dependent enzymes (Fe -S clusters) called the Fe -S enzymes have been 
reported to occur due to displacement by metals such as Ag, Hg, Cd, Co, Ni and Pb 
(Harrison et al. 2007; Lemire et al. 2013; Gadd and Griffiths 1977; Gadd 2004; Gadd 
2010; Giller et al. 1998). In addition, the displacement of Zn in δ -aminolevulinic acid 
dehydratase (ALAD) by Pb resulted in the inhibition of the enzyme activity. Another 
example is Ni disposition of Zn in the glycolytic enzyme, Frutose -6-bisphosphate 
aldolase, which leads to the inactivation of the enzyme (Lemire et al. 2013). Other 
mechanisms of metal toxicity include the disruption of electron transport chains and 
interference with cell membrane function (Lemire et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2007). 
Certai n metals such as Ag instigate the syphoning of protons from the electron 
transport chain. As a consequence, the proton motive force (PMF) is disturbed 
subsequently resulting in the destruction of the cells electron transport chain. Also, 
metals interfere w ith the assimilation of nutrients, a primary function of the cell 
membrane, by interfering with the transportation systems (Lemire et al. 2013; 
Harrison et al. 2007). Metals competitively occupy the binding sites resulting in an 
inhibition of uptakes of es sential nutrients such as sulphate -and cell starvation 
(Lemire et al. 2013).  
1.16.    Mechanism of metal resistance  
Metal toxicity to microbes has been widely acknowledged. However, certain microbes 
develop adaptation mechanisms to overcome toxicity effec ts on cells thereby resisting 
metal stress in environments containing heavy metals at toxic levels. Some of these 
mechanisms include the development of permeability barriers, active transport 
systems, intracellular sequestration, extracellular sequestratio n, enzymatic 
detoxification and metal sensitivity reduction (Bruins et al., 1999).   26 Microbes develop permeability barrier by altering the cell envelopes to exclude toxic 
heavy metals thereby protecting metal -sensitive cellul ar components. For instance, 
Almá rcegui et al. (2014) documented the adjustment of cellular proteins, Porins 
(channels through which nutrients are diffused into the cells) in Acidithiobacillus  
ferroxidans . This minimised the stress impact of Cu on the bacteria. The reduction in 
the expres sion of the gene that encodes Porin production in the presence of Cu, 
OMP40 was the evidence given that Porin production alteration was responsible for 
Cu resistance. Some bacteria produce extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) coatings to 
exclude toxic metals . The metals are usually adsorbed to the EPS layer. Cd adsorption 
by encapsulated strains of Klebsiella    aerogens , Pseudomonas  putida  and 
Arthrobacter  viscosus  have been documented (Bruins et al., 1999). In addition, the 
EPS-producing strain of Pseudomona s sp was observed to adsorb Cd and Pb (Huang 
and Liu 2013) .  Another observation was made by (Deb et al. 2013) in encapsulated 
cd resistant strain of P. stutzeri  where cd accumulated on the polysaccharide coated 
cell surface. Also, soil bacteria isolates w ere observed to accumulate Hg on the EPS 
coated cell envelope (François et al. 2012). In addition, there has been evidence of 
metal accumulation within the periplasmic region of the cell envelope. For instance, 
(Choudhary and Sar 2009) identified a metal r esistant strain of a Pseudomonas  
isolated from a uranium mine to exclude Ni , Co, Cu and Cd by accumulating the 
metals within the periplasmic region.  
Apart from cell envelope adjustment,  microbes develop active transport systems, 
which extrude toxic metals that were previously transported into the cytoplasm. These 
transport systems are efflux pumps. Efflux systems are highly specific for metals, are 
ATP or proton motive force (PMF) -dependent and are encoded on either plasmids or 
the chromosome. The microbial  resistance of Cd by efflux systems has been studied 
extensively.  A good example of such an efflux system is the ATP - dependent cad -
systems in Cd -resistant bacteria (Bruins et al, 1999). The cad -System consists of 
plasmid encoded proteins cadA - and cadC -proteins. The cadC proteins sort Cd and 
present the cation to cadA for exportation out of the cell before the toxic metal could 
interact with the sensitive essential cellular component. The process of extrusion starts 
when Cd attaches to the cysteine residu e of cadC protein, which then facilitates the 
metals attachment to cadA proteins. The formation of cadA -Cd complex initiates the 
attachment of ATP to cadA and subsequent phosphorylation. This enables the 
extrusion of the metal across the membrane. Another efflux system that is capable of  27 Cd extrusion from cells is the czc –efflux system. This is PMF -dependent. The czc -
efflux system was first identified in Alcaligenes  eutrophus  (Nies, 1992; bruins et al., 
1999).  
Recently, a czc -efflux system was observed in  Acidothiocacillus ferroxidans  (Chen et 
al. 2014). Other efflux systems responsible for the putative extrusion of other metals 
include: a P -type ATPase efflux system (NmtA) which excluded Ni and Co in the 
Actinobacterium , Streptomycetes  coelicolor  (Kim et al. 2015); the DmeRF system 
was responsible for Ni and Co exclusions from cells of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. 
Viciae ; the resistant nodulation cell division (RND) efflux systems in Gram -negative 
bacteria such as in E. coli  responsible for resistance to Cu  and Ag (Mealman et al. 
2012; Su et al. 2011; Delmar et al. 2013); the CopA system that extrudes Cu in 
Metellosphaera sedula , an extreme t hermoacidophilic Archeae  (McCarthy et al. 2014) 
and so many other efflux systems. Figure 1.6 shows the transport syste ms by which 
metals are transported into microbial cell membranes into the cytoplasm and extruded 
out of the cell.  
Furthermore, certain microorganisms develop resistance to toxic metals by 
sequestration of metals within the cell cytoplasm (intracellular seq uestration). When 
toxic metal are transported into the cell, cytoplasmic proteins (the metallothioneines 
(MTs) scavenge the metals preventing their binding to essential cell components. MTs 
have been identified in many prokaryotic organisms including Cyano bacteria , 
Pseudomonads , α-Proteobacteria , γ-proteobacteria , and Firmicutes  (Blindauer 2011). 
Some of the binding proteins include: the SmtA proteins that were observed in the 
metal resistant strains of the cyanobacteria Synechococcus  (Blindauer 2011; Olafs on 
1984) which sequester Cd, Cu, Hg and Zn (Blindauer 2011; Nies 1992); the CdBP1 
protein from Pseudomonas putida that sequestered Cd and Cu; the MymT protein in 
Mycobacterium sp  that binds to Cu (Blindauer 2011; Rowland and Niederweis 2012). 
Also, on expo sure to toxic concentrations of Fe, bacteria such as Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis  secrete the Bacterioferrins , which  sequester excess Fe (Rodriguez 2006).  
Apart from intracellular sequestration, microorganisms secrete organic compounds 
and inorganic compoun ds for extracellular sequestration of toxic metals thereby 
preventing the metal uptake by cells. The binding of metals to these chelating 
molecules transforms the size and chemical features of the metals resulting in reduced 
intake through the non -specific  porins (Schalk et al. 2011). For instance, siderophores,  28 organic compounds that usually bind to Fe, have been identified to be secreted by 
certain bacteria for the purpose of preventing to uptake of toxic metals (Schalk et al. 
2011; Lemire et al. 2013). P b-resistant strain of Bacillus  sp, MN34, associated with 
promoting the hyperaccumulation in Alnus firma , produced siderosphores to sequester

Pb (Shin et al. 2012). Also, Pyoverdine (PvdI), a major siderophore secreted by 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  PAOI to bind Fe, was observed to chelate other metals 
including Ag, Al, Cd, Co,  Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni and Zn (Braud et al. 2009). In addition, 
certain microbes secret thiol -rich ( -SH) compounds in response to metal stress. For  29 example, Acidithiobacillus  ferroxidans  secreted the amino acids with –SH groups, 
namely, cysteine and glutathione i n response to Cd stress (Zheng et al. 2015).  Apart 
from organic compounds, microbes also secret inorganic compounds such as 
sulphides and phosphates to precipitate metals. For instance, Siripornadulsil and 
Siripornadulsil (2013) reported the secretion of sulphides and -SH-rich compounds by 
Cd-resistant soil bacteria in metal contaminated rice field, which formed the insoluble 
form of Cd and prevented the uptake of the metal by both rice plants and bacteria.  
Other mechanisms of resistance include: the tran sformation of metals to non -toxic 
forms e.g. the transformation of Mercuric (Hg2+) to metallic Mercury (Hg0) catalysed 
by the Hg -reductase (MerA) secreted by microorganisms (Simbahan et al. 2005; 
Møller et al. 2011; Freedman et al. 2012) ; cell aggregation resulting in the formation 
of biofilm by microbes (Harrison et al. 2007; Poirier et al. 2013) ; metabolic bypass to 
prevent the effect by ROS (Poirier et al. 2013; Nies 1999; Bruins et al. 1999) .

Methods  
2.1 Sampling Sites Description  
Soil samples were  obtained from two different sites in this study:  the Nafferton 
Ecological group farm and   the former Lead Works site, St. Anthony’s Newcastle upon 
Tyne. Soil samples for Nafferton farms were used to determine the effect of Ni  (see 
chapter 4) , Cd (see chapter 5)  and Pb (short -term contamination ; see cha pter 6 ) on 
biodegradation whereas St. Anthony’s soils were used for the determination of the effect 
of long -term Pb contamination on crude oil biodegradation  (see chapter 6) . 
Nafferton farm occupies approximately 294 ha land managed by the Nafferton 
ecolog ical farming group (Newcastle University).  It is located on the north side of the 
Tyne valley approximately 24 km west of Newcastle upon Tyne (54°59'08.6"N 
1°53'56.2"W). The farm practices livestock rearing and crop cultivation practices. The 
crop cultiva tion involves organic and conventional farm. The soil used for this project 
was obtained from a fallow plot within the organic section of the farm. The soil of 
Nafferton farm has been described as loamy clay soil by the Cranfield Soil and 
AgriFood Institut e; technically classified as the Cambic Stagnogley (Avery, 1980; (Orr 
et al. 2012; Orr et al. 2011). This means that it is a uniform clay loam formed in slowly 
permeable Devensian glacial till deposits of the Brickfield series (Avery, 1980). This 
soil has a pH of 7.13±0.03.  
The choice of an agricultural soil is based on the idea that it is valuable agricultural soils, 
which are subject to contamination in places like the Niger delta, Nigeria   
The second sampling site is the former St. Anthony Lead Works l ocated approximately 
7 km south -east of the Newcastle City Centre by the Tyne River (54°57'40.0"N 
1°33'15.1"W). It is a site already heavily contaminated with lead and other heavy metals. 
Established in the 1840’s, St. Anthony’s works activities included p rocessing lead -silver 
ores from Spain into the white and red lead as well as silver. It was closed down in the 
1940s. Newcastle City council landscaped the site in the 1960s such that the ground was 
covered with topsoil, which was subsequently planted with  trees, shrubs and grasses 
transforming the site to a recreational ground for public use. Presently, it is a part of the 
Riverside Park, Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne. A study of soils from this site revealed 
the presence of high concentration of the heavy m etals Pb, As, Cd, Ni, Zn, Cu, Cr and  31 Mo (in order of magnitude) which were significantly above the recommended Soil 
Guideline values (SGVs) (Okorie et al. 2011; Okorie et al. 2012; Okorie 2010). Further 
studies on the oral bioavailability of these Potentia lly Toxic Elements (PTEs) were 
discovered to be within the range of 21 - 96% with the values of Pb and As being 
considered as a pose to significant possibility of significant Harm (Okorie et al. 2011; 
Okorie et al. 2012; Okorie 2010).  The soils from this s ite are loamy -clayey soil with pH 
of 7.1±0.06 at lower Pb contaminated site and 7.83±0.18 at high Pb contaminated site.  
2.2 Soil Sample collection and Handling Methods  
Sampling at Nafferton farm was conducted twice during the period of the project; on the  
27th of July 2012 and on the 23rd of August 2013. Sampling at the Former St. 
Anthony’s lead works was conducted once on the 23rd of August 2013. The period of 
sampling on these days was between 9am and 12pm. Soil samples were collected based 
on the guidel ines of the international Standard organisation (ISO) and the British 
Standard Institution (BSI) for collection, handling and storage of soil under aerobic 
conditions for assessment of microbiological processing biomass and diversity in the 
laboratory (ISO  10381 -6, 2009).  
Triplicate samples were collected from both sampling sites by clearing vegetation 
covering the soil before digging into the ground to about 10cm3 depth using a clean 
hand garden trowel. The soil was collected in clean plastic sampling bags  and safely 
transported immediately back to the laboratory for processing. In the Laboratory, the 
spatially obtained samples were pooled into a composite bulk sample and samples were 
stored away at 4oC and were used within 2 weeks after sampling. A proport ion of soil 
was stored at -20oC for DNA analysis. Prior to use, soil samples were conditioned to 
room temperature and air -dried by spreading evenly on a plastic tray before being 
passed through a 2mm sieve. Passing the soils through the sieve facilitated g aseous 
exchange hence maintaining the desired aerobic condition.  
Sieved soils were rewetted (adjusting the soil moisture to 60% of the water holding 
capacity of soil) and incubated at room temperature for 7days to stabilise the soil 
environment (Ouyang and Li 2013; Riepert and Felgentreu 2002; Van Gestel et al. 1993; 
Edition 2006)  
Caution was taken to minimise physical contact with the soil; hence, gloves were worn 
on sampling site and in the laboratory during sampling handling.   32 2.3 Soil Preliminary Analys is  
Baseline Physicochemical parameters of the soil samples were determined. These 
parameters included soil moisture content, soil pH, soil water holding capacity, Soil 
total organic carbon and Soil heavy metal content  
2.3.1 Soil pH  
 Soil pH is the measure  of alkalinity and acidity of soil and it is an important parameter 
that is considered in bioremediation processes. Its importance in petroleum degradation 
has been documented in the past studies (Dibble and Bartha 1979; Leahy and Colwell 
1990;  Thapa  et al. 2012)

works, walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, the site is contaminated with Pb and other heavy metals. (a) A map 
showing the location of the sample collection ; (b) the map of the site showing the concentrations  of Pb  in 
ppm.  See appendix II for the en larged version of st. Anthony work’s map. 34 In this research, the soil pH was determined using the ISO 10390 -2005. This is 
a standard developed for the determination of soil pH using a glass electrode.  
Pretreated soils (see section 2.2) were suspended in in  deionized water in 
triplicate samples 1:5 weight by weight. The mixtures were shaken thoroughl y 
for 1hr using a shaker  and were left to equilibrate overnight. The pH of the 
soil suspension was measured using the 3020 -pH metre  (Jenway Ltd UK) that 
was cali brated with st andard solutions of pH 4 and 7.  
2.3.2 Soil moisture content  
Soil moisture content was determined using the mass based gravimetric 
method outlined in ISO 7755 -3.1-1994 (ISO, 1994). Replicate of 10g of 
pretreated soil sample was dried to a cons tant mass at a temperature of 105oC 
in an oven (Memmert, Germany). The moisture content was determined by 
using the equation below  
 
Equation 2.1  
Moisture content =    M1-M2          
       X 100    
     M2-M0      
Where  
M1 =mass of crucible plus soil bef ore drying  
M2 =mass of crucible + soil after drying to constant mass  
M0 =mass of crucible (i. e. the tare)  
 
2.3.3. Soil water holding capacity  
In this study, the soil water holding capacity (W H2O) was determined in 
triplicate using the specifications in IS O 14238 -2013 (ISO 2012). A perforated 
cylinder, with a   filter paper (Whatmann  filter paper, No1) covered base, was 
partially filled with pretreated soil (see section 2.2) and partially submerged in 
water for 2 hours at room temperature. After 2 hours, th e cylinder was  35 completely immersed in water for 1  hr and then drained on a tray of wet fine 
quartz sand for 2hrs. The soil was then dried to a constant mass at 105oC in an 
oven (Memmert, Germany). The weights were measured to determine the  
WH2O using the e quation 2.2 . 
 
Equation 2.2  
WH2O  =     mS  -  mT - mD  X 100      
      
     mD        
Where  
mS= the mass of water -saturated soil plus the mass of the tube plus the mass of the  
 Filter paper, in grams;  
mT= the mass of tube plus mass of filter paper, in grams;  
mD= dry mass of soil  in grams  
 
2.3.4 Soil total organic carbon  
The determination of total organic carbon (TOC) of the soils was carried out 
by Derwentside Environmental Testing Services (DETS) Durham, UK. DETS 
in-house method DETSC 2084 was used f or this analysis. Soil samples were 
pretreated with 5% phosphoric acid to destroy the inorganic carbon by the 
consistent addition of 1ml of 5% H 3PO 4 to (by dry weight) of soil sample 
(homogenised  and wetted) until no effervescence was observed. Total carbo n 
was determined by combustion of the pretreated soil and detection of CO 2 by 
infrared method during combustion.  
2.3.5 Soil heavy metal content  
The heavy metal content of the soils was carried out by Derwentside 
Environmental Testing Services (DETS) Durham , UK. Soil samples were  
analysed  for heavy metals including Hg, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, V, Zn and 
B.  First, samples were dried and crushed to pass through a 425μm sieve based 
on BS 1377 ((BS) 1990). Then, to determine the metals, in -house documented  36 methods based on the Standing Committee of Analysts methods were used 
(UK Environmental Agency 2006; DEFRA 2009). To test for heavy metals in 
soils (Apart from Hg and B), Aqua  regia  digestion was carried out based on 
specifications in BS EN 13657:2002 (Stan dard 2002). Aqua regia digestion 
involves the digestion of sample using aqua regia reagent which is basically a 
mixture of 65% to 70% Nitric Acid (HNO 3) and 35% to 37% Hydrochloric 
Acid (HCl) in the ratio of 1:3 volume by volume respectively. Apart from Hg  
and B, heavy metals were determined using inductively coupled plasma 
optical emission spectroscopy (ICP -OES). For Hg testing, soil samples are 
purged with argon, the elemental mercury is collected on a silica -gold vapour 
trap and the collected elemental m ercury analysed by atomic fluorescence 
spectroscopy. Quantification is performed by comparison to a generated 
calibration curve. The analysis of B was carried out using colorimetric method 
(Spencer and Erdmann 1979). First, B was extracted by hot water met hod. 
This is followed by the addition of the colorimetric reagent Azomethine -H and 
detection using the spectrophotometric method.  
2.4 Experimental design  
In brief, Soil microcosms were set up to simulate heavy metal -petroleum co -
contaminated soils and were  incubated for approximately 2 weeks. Within the 
incubation period, the microbial activity, which measures CO 2 production in 
each microcosm, was determined to ascertain biodegradation of petroleum. 
Microbial activity is as a result of complete mineralisati on of soil organics to 
CO 2 and H 2O. In aerobic soils, the process involves the oxidation of organic 
materials coupled to the reduction of molecular oxygen to release carbon for 
biomass and energy conservation while releasing CO 2. After the incubation 
perio d, the geochemical analysis was carried out to determine the extent and 
pattern of biodegradation solvent -solvent extraction, solid phase extraction 
and Gas Chromatography.  
Also, microbiological analysis to determine the microbial phylogeny and 
microbial diversity of soils using molecular microbiological methods 
including Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Agarose Gel Electrophoresis 
(AGE), Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and Ion Torrent -
Personal Genomic Machine (Ion Torrent PGM) sequencing. R eal time -qPCR 
was used to enumerate soil microbes by targeting 16S rRNA gene specific for  37 taxonomic groups. The design of Primer sets, the validation of qPCR assay 
and the enumeration of target genes are described in the next Chapter.  
2. 4. 1 Soil Microcos m  
Metal -crude oil co -contaminated soil environment was simulated in soil 
microcosms. All, soil microcosms were set up in 150ml amber serum bottles 
such that there was increasing concentrations of different mineral forms heavy 
metals (see 2.4). Primarily, each microcosm consists of 10g of soil, 100 mg of 
undegraded medium gravity North Sea crude oil (obtained from British 
Petroleum) and appropriate concentration and mineral form of heavy metals. 
Inorganic nutrient in the form of sodium nitrate and potassium  dihydrogen 
phosphate were added such that there were C : N: P  ratio of 100:  10: 1 weight 
by weight. The moisture of the soil was adjusted to the 60% of the soil’s water 
holding capacity. The microcosms were incubated in a dark room at room 
temperature for 14-16 days.  
This project investigates the effects of Ni, Cd and Pb. The Heavy metal 
concentrations and mineral form varied depending on different heavy metals. 
In choosing the metal concentration the UK environmental agency’s soil 
guideline values (SGV) in  allotment areas, Dutch list recommendation values 
and the documented metal concentrations in soils associated with the history 
of Petroleum spill were considered. Presently, the SGV of Pb is presently 
being reconsidered by UK environmental agency. However , previous SGV 
was considered in this project. Values below and above the considered 
guideline for each metal were used in this project. Metals were added in 
soluble and insoluble mineral forms. The Cd was added as CdCl 2 and CdO 
while Pb was added in the f orm of PbCl 2 and PbS. As for Ni, three mineral 
forms were used. This included NiO, NiCl 2 and Ni -porphyrin, the form in 
which Ni exist in the soil, was also investigated. Table 2.1 shows the 
variations of metal concentrations, metal M ineral forms the SGVs a nd Dutch -

2.5. Soil Microbial Activities  
In this project, t he soil microbial activity was measured by determining CO 2 
flux in the headspace of experimental soil microcosms. Specifically, CO 2 
production was used to assess the extent of hydrocarbon degradation by 
comparison of CO 2 production rates and total yields i n oil -amended and 
unamended soil controls. Biodegradation of the petroleum was monitored in 
the soil microcosms by  analysing  the headspace gas composition using a Gas 
Chromatography -Mass Spectroscopy (GC -MS) method (a modified version of 
international stan dard organisation’s guideline for the determination of 
microbial soil respiration using GC ISO 16072 2002). Headspace CO 2 was 
analysed using the GC -MS. 100 μl of headspace gases were manually injected 
into GC -MS system,  Fision  MD800 (electron voltage 70 eV , filament current 
4 A, source current 800 μA, source temperature 200 °C, multiplier voltage 500 
V, interface temperature 150 °C), using a gas -tight syringe (SGE Analytical, 
Australia). The gas sample was separated in the system using the HP -PLOT Q Metals  Mineral forms  1Concentrations

580    40 capilla ry column (30 m X 0.32 m) with 20 -μm Q phase. The carrier gas in this 
system is the Helium gas (1ml/min, 65kpa, split at 100m/min, 35oC). Xcalibur 
software was used to determine the data. Headspace gases were determined 
using parent ion at mass to charge r atio (m/z) of 44. Chromatographic peaks of 
m/z 44 were integrated and quantified and saved as excel file for further data 
processing. In addition, calibration curves were determined by using different 
volumes of mixed gas with 10% CO 2. The slopes of the ca libration curves 
were determined and the R2 values of curves determined were above 0.99. 
The slope was used to determine the cumulative CO 2 in microcosms. 
Cumulative CO 2 values were calculated and expressed in MolCO 2*g-1 dry 
soil, using the ideal gas equat ion (PV=nRT) modified to resolve into two 
component terms i.e. mass of CO 2 and molecular weight CO 2. The rate of CO 2 
Flux was calculated from the linear accumulation of CO 2 and expressed in 
milliMol CO 2 g-1 dry soil day -1 as well.  
To ensure that oxic condi tions were maintained in microcosms, the Oxygen, 
O2, content were monitored simultaneously. Integrating and quantifying 
chromatographic peak of m/z 32 determined the O2 in headspace gases. O2 of 
the headspace gases was replaced with atmospheric air when ox ygen dropped 
below15%.  
The differences in cumulative CO 2 production and rate of microbial activities 
in microcosms were assessed statistically using the Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) coupled with multiple comparison analyses by Tukey’s and 
Fisher’s methods and Regression analysis in MINITAB EXPRESS software 
and SPSS.  
2.6 Compositional changes in petroleum hydrocarbon  
The total n -alkanes were determined in the experimental microcosms after 15 
days of incubation. First, hydrocarbons were extracted from the soi ls using 
solvent -solvent extraction method coupled with the solid phase extraction the 
method developed by (Bennett et al. 2007). Finally, the total n -alkanes were 
determined using the Gas Chromatography (GC).  The methods used are 
discussed in this sectio n. 
  41 2.6.1 Solvent - Solvent extraction  
250 ul of the standard solution of squalane (~200mg / L representing ~0.5% of 
the initial added crude oil was dispensed into the soil microcosm bottles. Here 
squalane acts as a surrogate extraction standard. 10ul each of the solvents 
Methanol, Toluene and Dichloromethane (DCM) were added to the 
microcosms sequentially to extract soil extractable organic components. The 
microcosms were vigorously agitated and emptied unto a Buchner filtration 
system for subsequent extrac tion by exerting pressure.  The Buchner filtration 
system consists of Buchner perforated filter, Whatman filter paper, grade 1 
(Sigma -Aldrich, UK) and Buchner filter flask connected to a laboratory water 
tap. While still under pressure, 10ml each of methan ol, toluene and DCM were 
used to rinse the soil twice. The filtrate /extract was loaded into 500 ml 
separating funnels for further extraction.  30 ml each of methanol and DCM 
was sequentially used to rinse the Buchner flask and the rinse was dispensed 
into the separating funnel. Also, 50 ml of deionized water was added to the 
separating funnel. The content of the separating funnel was manually and 
continuously agitated for 5 minutes. The funnel was set to stand for 1 hr using 
a tripod stand to separate the liquids. After 1 hr, a mixture of organic solvents 
and extractable organics, which settles at the lower layer of the separating 
funnel, was eluted into a round bottom flask. Organics remaining in the upper 
layer was extracted, 3 times, by adding 30 ml each  of DCM and deionized 
water and agitating for 5 minutes. Separation occurred for 15 minutes and 
organics were, again, eluted into the round bottom flask. As stated earlier, the 
liquid collected in the round bottom flask consists of a mixture of organic 
solvents and extractable organics. To remove the solvents, the liquid in the 
round bottom flask was rotary evaporated to ~5 ml.  Subsequently, the liquid 
was transferred to a clean 10 ml vial and blown down to dryness under a 
gentle stream of Nitrogen gas.  
2.6.2. Solid Phase extraction  
Hydrocarbon and the polar non -hydrocarbon fraction of the Extractable 
organic matter were isolated independently using the Solid Phase extraction 
(SPE) Method. Generally, SPE involves the isolation based on the partitioning 
of analyte into a solid and a liquid medium. Compounds to be isolated adsorb 
to the solid matrix (Sorbent) base on the intermolecular forces between the  42 analyte, the liquid phase and the active sites on the sorbent. The isolates are 
then eluted with the approp riate solvents.  
The SPE method developed by Bennett et al (2007) was adapted for this 
project. The sorbent used in this method was a non -endcapped octadecyl (C 18) 
silicate. This is silica, which is bonded to the hydrophobic methyl group (in 
this case octad ecyl-). This is important in retaining the polar compounds 
allowing isolation of petroleum fractions. The concept of non -endcapped C 18 
is based on the fact that the non -polar compounds interact with the 
hydrophobic sorbent by van -der-Waal forces and are ea sily eluted with a non -
polar solvent. In contrast, the polar or moderately compounds are bound to the 
–OH group on the silica surface and are eluted later with a polar solvent. 
Hexane was used to elute the non -polar fractions of the Extractable Organic 
Matter while DCM was used to elute the Polar fraction. To achieve this, SPE 
column, Isolute C 18 (Biotage, UK) was prepared by rinsing with DCM. This 
was left for approximately 24 hrs or until DCM has evaporated. Subsequently, 
the column was conditioned by rin sing with 10 ml of Hexane.  10 ul of 
internal standard, Heptadeclycyclohexane (at a concentration of ~1mg/ ml), 
was added to 50% of EOM. This was transferred to the conditioned SPE 
column and was eluted with 5 ml hexane. The eluate, which consists of the 
non-polar hydrocarbon fraction, was collected in a clean 10 ml vial. 
Subsequently, the polar compounds were eluted with DCM in a clean 10 ml 
Vial. 0.5ml of the non -polar fraction was transferred to a Gas Chromatography 
–Flame Ionisation Detector auto -sample r vial for analysis. The GC-FID 
system used was the Hewlett - Packard 5890 series II with FID, connected to a 
computer. The GC -FID analysis enables the identification n -Alkanes and 
determination of the total n -alkanes by the identification and integration o f 
peaks. The quantification of recovered hydrocarbons was calculated by using 
the equations 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.

2.7 Heavy metal partitioning in petroleum soil  
Determination of the fate of added metals in the soil provides an 
understanding of the mobility and toxicity of these metals and thus an 
understanding of the various observed effects on microbial activit ies in the soil 
microcosm experiments detailed above. To achieve this, the chemical 
associations of added heavy metals in the soils were determined using the 
sequential extraction method of Tessier et al.  (1979).  This method involves a 
sequential partiti oning of metals into five main fractions – exchangeable 
fractions, fractions bound to carbonates, fractions bound to oxides of Fe and 
Mn, fractions bound up into organic matter and residuals.  
Triplicate soil samples for this experiment were prepared by ad ding known 
concentrations of metals into soils. The soils were dried overnight at room 
temperature. 1g of the dry soil was weighed into 50ml centrifuge tube and 
sequentially extraction of metals commenced by adding appropriate reagents 
(see table 2.2), whi ch selectively extract the heavy metals bound to 
appropriate fractions. The metals investigated were Cd, Ni and Pb in soluble 
and insoluble forms. The mineral forms of metals were CdCl 2, CdO, NiCl 2, 
NiO, PbCl 2 and PbS.  
The exchangeable are the metal fract ions that are usually the free cation in the 
soil water solution plus those that are loosely bound/adsorbed to soil surfaces 
at the exchangeable sites. They are the most mobile, in other words, they are 
the most readily available fraction of soil metals. A  change in the ionic 
composition soil water affects the sorption and desorption cations. Hence,  44 usually, salt solutions are used to leach the metal fractions from the solid 
matrix (Zimmerman and Weindorf 2010). In this experiment, exchangeable 
were extract ed using 10 ml of magnesium chloride (MgCl 2) for 1 hr. at neutral 
pH.

The metal fractions associated with carbonates are otherwise known as the 
acid soluble fr actions. Usually, the metal fraction is susceptible to pH. The 
increase in pH enhances the fixation of metals to carbonates through the 
incorporation of cations in carbonate unit cells (Zimmerman and Weindorf 
2010; Plassard et al. 2000). Therefore, to diss ociate cations, an acidic 
condition is essential. In the present experiment, carbonate associates were 
leached at acidic pH of 5 using an acidic salt solution of sodium acetate. pH 
was adjusted to 5 using acetic acid. Continuous agitation was maintained fo r 
6hrs.   45  
The oxides of Fe and Mn are known to act as concretions between soil or 
sediment particles or as simple coatings on particle surfaces and are excellent 
cations scavengers (Tessier et al. 1979) . The metals bound to Fe - and Mn - 
oxides are affected by redox condition. Under anoxic/reduced conditions, 
metals bound to these oxides  are released but are immediately precipitated as 
sulfides (Zimmerman and Weindorf 2010) . Therefore, extraction of the metal 
fractions requires solutions capable of dissolving insoluble sulfide salts. In this 
experiment, Metal fraction was extracted with 20 mL of 0.04 M NH 2OH-HCl 
in 25% (V/V) HOAc. Extraction was performed at 96±  3 oC with occasional 
agitation for a duration of 6 hrs.  
Usually, metals in the soil bind to soil organic forms (Zimmerman and 
Weindorf 2010; Gadd 2004; Gadd and Griffiths 1977; Mclean and Bledsoe 
1992; Ankley et al. 1994)  such as living cells/ organisms, detritus, organic 
acids such as humic and citric acids, small molecular weight organic 
compounds such amino acids and proteins, soil organic contaminants such as 
petroleum hydrocarbon and  PAHs e. t. c. Metals bound to Organic Matter 
were extracted using  3 mL of 0.02 M HN0 3 and 5 mL of 30% H 2O2 adjusted to 
pH 2 with HN0 3, and the mixture was heated to 85 ± 2 oC for 2 hr. duration 
with occasional agitation. A second 3 -ml aliquot of 30% H 202 (pH 2 with 
H2SO 4) was then added and the sample was heated again to 65 ± 2 oC for 3 hr. 
duration within which periodic agitation was carried out. After cooling, 5 ml 
of 3.2 M NH 4OAc in 20% (v/v) HN0 3 was added and the sample was diluted 
to 20 ml and agitat ed continuously for 30 min. The addition of NH 4OAc is 
designed to prevent adsorption of extracted metals onto the oxidized sediment.  
Residual fractions consist of metals embedded in the crystal structure of the 
primary and secondary minerals. The metals a re not easily dissociated. Hence, 
strong acids such as HF -HClO 4 (Tessier et al. 19 79) are usually employed to 
extract metals. However, in this experiment, residual fractions were not 
extracted due to safety considerations. Therefore, residual fractions’ 
concentrations were assumed to be the metal concentrations that were not 
accounted for in the other fractions.  
Separation was performed by centrifugation (Sorvall, model RC 5B Plus) at  46 10000 rpm (12000 g) for 30 min between successive extractions. The 
supernatant was removed with a  pipet  and analyse d for trace metals by Atomic 
Absorptio n spectrometry. The residue was washed with 8 ml of deionized 
water. After a repeated centrifugation for 30 min, supernatant was discarded.  
 
2.8. Soil Microbiology  
2.8.1 DNA extraction  
Genomic DNA was extracted from ~0.25 g of soil samples from each 
micro cosms using the PowerSoil ® DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, 
USA) in triplicate according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Procedural blanks 
were also carried out. These provided the template for the microbiological 
studies. The end volume of the extr act was 100 μl. The DNA isolation 
procedure comprises of a combination mechanical and chemical methods. 
First, bead breaking using the ribolyser, FastPrep -24 instrument(MP 
biomedicals, USA)  for 30 secs combined with chemical cell disruption using 
sodium d odecyl sulphate (a detergent) were employed to lyse soil microbial 
cells. This was followed by a series of chemical purification, which involved 
the precipitation, and removal of non -DNA material (organic and inorganic.  
Eventually, silica membrane was use d to selectively isolate DNA in 
concentrated salt solution (NaCl). Subsequently, the bound DNA was washed 
with ethanol to remove residual salts and other impurities.  DNA was eluted 
through the membrane using elution buffer, which is basically sterile salt -free 
10mM Tris solution.  The credibility of the DNA extractions was determined 
by checking the DNA extracts and the Procedural blanks using Agarose gel 
electrophoresis (AGE; see section 2.8.3).  
2.8.2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  
DNA extracts from the  original bulk soils, soil microcosms and procedural 
blanks were subjected to PCR amplification targeting the highly conserved 
16S rRNA gene specific for bacteria and Archaea. For DGGE analysis 
(discussed in the next session), the V3 region of the 16S rRNA  gene was 
targeted using primer 2 (Vr) and primer 3 (Vf) with a GC -clamp (Muyzer et al. 
1993; Sherry et al. 2013). These primers anneal to positions 518 -534 and 341 - 47 357 of the 16S rRNA gene based on E. coli 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
numbering (Brosius et al. 1978) at 53oC.  The sequence for Vf with the GC  
Clamp (in bracket) was 5’ -
(CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGC  
ACGGGGG) GCCTACG GGAGGCAGCAG -3’. Also, the sequence of Vr 
primer was 5’ -ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG -3’. To conduct PCR, 47 μl Mega 
Mix-Blue (Microzone Limited, UK) reagent, 1ul soil genomic DNA extract 
and 1ul of each primer (at a concentration of 10 pmol per μl) were dispensed 
into a clean molecular biology grade 200 μl Eppendorf tubes (StarLab, UK). 
Amplifications were carried out using an automated thermal cycler Techne 
TC-5000 (Bibby Scientific, UK). The amplification reaction included 1 min 
initial denaturation at 95oC followed by 24 cycles of 30 sec denaturation at 
95oC, 1 min initial annealing at 65oC but reduced by 1oC after every 2 cycles 
and 1 min extension 72oC. This is followed by 15 cycles with the annealing 
temperature of 53oC and 10 min final extension at 72oC. DNA samp les were 
amplified in triplicate. Procedural blanks were carried out as well.  
 
In addition, Amplicons were generated for ion torrent / PGM sequencing and 
different 16S rRNA primer sets were employed to generate amplicons. 
Usually, amplicon library is const ructed prior to sequencing. Here, fusion 
primer set that  compliment  the V4 and V5 region of 16S rRNA genes was 
used.  
This primer set was F515 -R926 and have been used in previous studies 
(Quince et al. 2011). The sequence of the primers included 5’ - 
GTGNCA GCMGCCGCGGTAA -3’ for F515 and 5’ -
CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT -3’ for R926. Usually, for ion torrent 
amplicon library construction, the forward primers are ligated PGM linker 
primer/ adapter, a Golay barcode (unique for each sample DNA, hence, 
distinguishing DNA sa mples) and a barcode spacer, which corrects 
sequencing errors (Hamady et al. 2008; Whiteley et al. 2012) at the 5’ end of 
the primer. These are presented in table 2.3 Also, the revers primer was ligated 
to truncated P1 (TrP1) adapter at 5’ end of the prime r and the sequence of this 
attachment was 5’-ATCACC GACTGCCCATAGAGAGG -3’. The amplicon 
size is 481 bps.

PCR procedure was as described above and by Whiteley et al. (2012) but with 
little modifications. Bioline’s TaqMan DNA amplification kit (Bioline UK) 
was employed in lieu of mega -mix blue reagent as used above. The reaction 
conditions were 95  °C for 3 mins initial denaturation followed by 30  cycles of 
95 °C 1  min denaturation , 55 °C, 45 secs annealing 72  °C 1 mins (extension) 
and a final extension at 72°C  for 10 mins. The experiment was equally carried 
out in triplicates. Procedural samples were also carried out simultaneously.   49  
2.8.3. Agarose gel electrophoresis  
AGE was used to ascer tain the credibility of the genomic DNA after DNA 
extraction from the soils and to determine that the correct amplicon size was 
produced by PCR reactions.  The products of DNA extraction and PCR were 
analysed using ethidium bromide (Et Br) (1.6 μl EtBr in 100 ml gel solution) 
stained 1% Agarose gel (Sigma -Aldrich, UK) prepared with 1X TAE buffer (2 
M Tris -Acetate, 0.05 M EDTA, pH 8.3).  5 μl of DNA extract, PCR product 
and reference DNA size marker, Hyperladder II DNA Marker (Bioline, UK ) 
were loaded into the wells of the cast Agarose gel. Electrophoresis was 
conducted in 1X TAE buffer at 100 volts for 60 minutes. The gels were 
visualised by UV illumination using a gel visualising and documentation 
system, Automated bioSpectrum Imaging sy stem (Ultra -Violet Products 
(UVP), UK).  
2.8.4. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)  
Microbial community diversity in original soils and soil microcosms was 
studied using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). This method 
separates the co nstituent sequences based on their differential mobility in a 
denaturing gradient polyacrylamide gel. The result is a pattern of bands 
representing the prominent microbial types present in the sample (Muyzer et al. 
1993). This method has been used successf ully in the past for microbial 
community studies (Slatko and Albright 2001; Gray et al. 2011; Nakatsu 2007; 
Muyzer and Smalla 1998; Muyzer et al. 1993; Sherry et al. 2013; Hubert et al. 
2012; Hale et al. 2010). DGGE is limited in the resolution and informa tion it 
can provide but in the context of these studies, DGGE was used to indicate 
diversity variation between original soil, treatments, experimental replicates 
and to identify community selection to focus on the ion torrent sequencing 
strategy.  
INGENYPho rU-2x2 system, which consists of the buffer tank, gradient maker 
and an electrophoresis cassette, was used to conduct DGGE. The 10% 
acrylamide gels used consisted of a mixture of 40% BisAcrylamide (Sigma -
Aldrich Corporation, USA), 50X TAE buffer, Deionized  Formamide (Sigma - 50 Aldrich Corporation, USA), urea (the denaturant; Sigma -Aldrich Corporation, 
USA) and deionized water. The solidifying agents, APS and TEMED were 
also added to the mixtures in the ratio of (100:10) just before gel casting. The 
denaturing g radient was created on the gel by combining denaturing solutions 
consisting of 40% denaturant and 70% denaturant in the electrophoresis 
cassette using a gradient maker -peristaltic pump system.   Reagent mixture 
consisting of 0% denaturant was used as the s tack. Wells were created in the 
gel to accommodate DNA samples. The cast gel was placed in the preheated 
buffer tank consisting of 1X TAE. Each well on the gel was loaded with a 
combination of 22 μl PCR product / marker and 22 μl loading buffer. The 
maker used consisted of 12 cloned 16S rRNA gene fragments. They were 
loaded in multiple regularly spaced lanes in gels. Electrophoresis was carried 
out at 100 volts for 16 hours. Gels were stained with a fluorescent dye, the 
SyBr green (sigma Aldrich, USA) for 3 0 minutes. The stained gel was 
visualised by UV illumination using gel visualising and documentation system, 
Automated bioSpectrum Imaging system (Ultra -Violet Products (UVP), UK)  
2.8.5 Statistical Analysis DGGE Gels  
The electrophoresis gels obtained from DGGE -fingerprinting were analysed 
using the BioNumerics software (Applied Math, Belgium). The tools of this 
software make the normalisation of the gel efficient, allowing for 
compensation of in travel and internal variations in gradient. This was 
achieved by inclusion of the same marker profile in all gels. Bands 
representing different components of the microbial communities in different 
profiles were detected automatically.  Band assignments were then manually 
checked. Comparative quantification of band pa tterns was automatically 
computed within and between gels generating Band presence/absence data. 
Similarities were measured using the Jaccard coefficients. Data generated 
were exported from Bionumerics for further statistical analysis of community 
structur e. The Multidimensional scale analysis (MDS) in PRIMER 6 software 
((Primer -E Ltd., Plymouth, UK) was performed on the data generated to 
identify profile relatedness between communities (Clarke and Gorley 2006; 
Clarke and Warwick 2001). MDS uses an algorith m which successively 
refines the positions of the points until they satisfy, as closely as possible, the  51 dissimilarity between samples (Foster 1983) providing a 2 dimensional (2D) 
graphical representation, where points that are close together represent 
samples that are very similar in composition. This is achieved by using the 
Bray -Curtis similarity coefficient to generate similarity matrix. Also, the 
algorithm generates a 2D stress value, which denotes how accurately the 
dimensional relationships among sam ples are represented in the 2D output. 
Low stress values close to 0 are indicative of excellent representation, values 
of 0.1 showing good representation and stresses of 0.2 demonstrating 
potentially useful outputs. However, values close to and exceeding 0 .3 
indicate that placement of points in 2D space is close to random and should be 
discounted (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). The MDS plot was overlaid with 
clusters generated from Cluster Analysis, which was based on CLUSTER 
method in primer 6. This was perfor med to identify groups using contours that 
specify 20, 40, 60, and 80 % similarity (Foster 1983).  
Furthermore, pairwise analysis, the Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), was 
used to assess discriminations between communities. Here, the statistics, 
Global R -Value (R), was used to determine the degree of dissimilarities 
between communities. R -values range from 0 to 1. The closer R is to 0, the 
more similar the communities. On the contrary, the closer R is to 1, the more 
the discrimination between replicate com munities (Foster 1983; Clarke, KR, 
Gorley 2006). The significance of R was assessed by generalised 
randomization based on the Monte Carlo simulation test ((Hope 1968; Clarke 
and Green 1988) generating the statistics, p -values. P -values were reported as 
percentages with signif icant values between 0 to 5 %.  
2.8.6. Ion torrent -PGM sequencing of tagged 16S rRNA PCR products  
In this project, ion torrent/ personal genome machine (PGM) sequencing 
method (Life technologies, USA) was applied to sequence 16S rRNA gene, 
which was subsequently analysed to determine a more detailed diversity and 
phylogeny of communities. This is to complement the DGGE diversity studies 
which have its limitations including the possibility of a band representing 
multiple species or mult iple bands representing a single species (Samarajeewa 
et al. 2014). The stepwise procedure for ion torrent sequencing involves DNA  52 Library construction, template preparation and detection of incorporated 
nucleotides. Prepared DNA library was submitted to t he in -house 
environmental engineering research laboratory for sequencing.  
2.8.6.1. DNA Library Construction  
DNA library was generated by carrying out PCR as described in section 2.8.2 
tagged primer set was used for the PCR reaction to distinguish sample DN A. 
The amplicons were purified using Agencourt Ampure XP purification Kit 
(Beckman Coulter Ltd, UK). This kit utilises Beckman Coulter’s solid -phase 
reversible immobilisation (SPRI) paramagnetic bead technology for high -
throughput purification of PCR ampli cons. Here, 90 μl of Agencourt Ampure 
XP reagent (at room temperature) was added to 50ul amplified DNA sample 
in a 200 μl PCR tube. The tube was placed on a magnet for 2 minutes to allow 
the clearing of the solution. The supernatant was discarded. To wash the 
samples, 30 ul freshly prepared 70% ethanol was added to tubes still on the 
magnetic and incubated at room temperature for 30 seconds. The supernatant 
was removed. This was repeated twice. The samples were air dried for ~ 5 
minutes. 20 ul PCR -grade wat er was mixed thoroughly with the samples using 
a vortex and was left to stand for 1 minute. Cleared supernatant containing the 
purified amplified DNA was carefully transferred to a clean PCR tube. 
Purified amplicons were quantified using the high sensitive  fluorescence dye 
based Qubit Fluorometer 2.0 combined with Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit  
(life technologies) to determine the concentration of double stranded DNA of 
PCR products. The Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit consist of assay reagent, 
dilution buffer, and p re-diluted DNA standards. To quantify DNA in samples, 
working solution was prepared by diluting reagent in a buffer in the ratio of 1: 
200 v/v in a clean 500 μl tube. Subsequently, samples and standards were 
prepared for quantification by diluting 10 μl of  each in 190 μl of working 
solution. These were incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature. Qubit 
fluorometer was calibrated with the standards prior to the quantification of 
samples’ DNA concentration with the instrument. Concentrations were 
determined i n ng/ml using the calculator system of Qubit fluorometer. 
Subsequently, an equimolar DNA library, consisting of amplified tagged DNA 
samples, was generated such that the concentration of the pooled library is 
25.3 ng/μl.  This was achieved by determining t he volume of amplicons per  53 sample that is equivalent to the 1 ul of the sample having the highest 
concentration of DNA (see equation 2.6)  
 
Volume of X ( l)  = Highest concentration

Where X is the amplicons per sample  
 
2.8.6.2.  DNA Tem plate preparation for sequencing  
Prior to sequencing, sequencing templates were generated by attaching the DNA 
samples to ion sphere particles using ion PGMTM Template OT2 400 kit (life 
Techn ologies, USA) according to manufacturer’s  instruction s. This Kit consisted of 
on Sphere™ particles, buffers, PCR reagent and enzyme mixes, consumables, and 
primers. It amplifies DNA based on 400 bp. This process was carried out in 
OneTouch™ 2 System. The s ystem consists of the Ion OneTouch™ 2 Instrument ( an 
integration of reaction filter, thermal cycler and micro -centrifuge) and the Ion 
OneTouch™ ES. 1ul of amplicon library diluted in 24 μl of nuclease -free water was 
mixed with amplification solution to a volume of 900 μl in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube. 
Amplifi cation solution comprised of PCR enzymes, Primers and other reagents. The 
PCR primers are usually oligonucleotides complementary to the Adapter attached to 
the fusion primers used for ampl icon library construction. 100 µ l of ion sphere 
particles, ISP, was added to the Eppendorf tube containing the amplification solution 
mixture to a final volume of 1000 μl. This was loaded onto the filter assemble in the 
One Touch instrument. 2000 μl of reaction oil was sequentially loaded to the filter at 
the initial volum e of 1000 μl and subsequent volume of 500 μl. Emulsion PCR was 
performed with the appropriate program for ~16 hours. ISP was recovered by 
centrifugation. The recovered ISP was washed with 500 μl wash solutions. This was 
centrifuged for 2.5 minutes at 15,50 0 X g. 100 μl of the supernatant was retained and 
was enriched in the One TouchTM Enrichment System.  
 
2.8.6.3.     Personal Genomic Machine (PGM) sequencing  
Enriched ion sphere particles were sequenced using PGM sequencing Platform 
with Ion PGM TM sequenci ng 400 kits. PGM sequencing involves the real -
time measurement of Hydrogen ion produced during DNA hybridization. The 
incorporation of nucleotide base results to a release of H+. The kit used  54 comprised of the reagents required for PGM sequencing of 400 bp run on 
semi -conductor chips. The reagents include the polymerase, nucleotides, 
sequencing reagents and sequencing control. First, 5 μl of sequencing control 
was mixed thoroughly with enriched ion sphere particle. To anneal primer to 
Ion sphere particles, 1 5 μl of the ISP - sequencing control mixture was added 
to 12 μl of primer. The primer was annealed at 37oC for 2 minutes in a lid 
heated (95 oC for 2 minutes) thermal cycler. After annealing of primer to ISP, 
3 μl of polymerase was added to the reaction. Th is was succeeded by 
incubation of reaction at room temperature for 5 minutes. The reaction 
mixture (now consisting of ISP ligated to Primers and polymerase) was loaded 
on sequencing chip for sequencing. For this project, Ion 316 Tm Chip was 
used. This chip  could recover up to 1 Gigabases and a data of up to 3 million 
sequences reads. Sequencing was run in the PGM sequencer, which was 
controlled using the ion Torrent Suite software (Life technologies, USA).  
Furthermore, Ion torrent suite software was used t o retrieve sequence data in 
FASTA file format after the sequencing had occurred and after filtering 
individual sequence reads within the software to remove low quality and 
polyclonal sequences.  
The sequence data obtained was analysed using the QIIME (Capor aso et al. 
2010; Kuczynski et al. 2012) and the Mothur software (Schloss et al. 2009) to 
trim sequence data, cluster sequence data into OTUs, assign taxonomic groups 
to OTUs and analyse community diversity (alpha - and beta - diversity of 
communities). Furth ermore, using the Sequence Match platform on Ribosomal 
Database Project database Release 11 (Metzker 2010; Cole et al. 2014) (RDP) 
and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool databases, close relatives of the most 
predominant OTUs in communities were determined and their sequences were 
aligned up to MEGA 6 to obtain a phylogenetic tree  (using the neighbour 
joning method and clustering in boostrap tes 50 replicates) , which elaborates 
relatedness. This is essential in designing specific qPCR primers, which are 
specific taxonomic groups, required in the enumeration of the taxonomic 
group of interest. The Design of Primers, validation of qPCR assay and 
enumeration of target genes are described in the next chapter.  
 
 
  55 2.8.7.    Primer validation and Optimisation of Rea l time -qPCR assay  
In this project, validation of the primer sets involved, sequentially, the 
determination of optimum annealing temperature, melt curve analysis of 
amplicons and agarose gel analysis to verify the specificity of amplicon size 
and the determ ination of standard curve to ensure that a linear response of the 
assay in response to a standard dilution series of the target taxon is achieved. 
Samples of Typed 16S rRNA sequences of representative bacteria of target 
taxonomic group were obtained commer cially (DSMZ, Germany). These 
included the 16S rRNA sequences samples of Rhodococcus erythropolis  
(DSM 43066) representing the Rhodococcus  sp enriched in Cd and Ni 
amended microcosms and Scopulibacillus darangshiesis (DSM 19377) 
representing the Bacillales  group that enriched in Pb soils. To prepare the 
standards, typed 16S rRNA DNA obtained commercially (DSMZ, Germany) 
were quantified by determining the molecular concentration of DNA using a 
spectrophotometric method (NanoDrop 1000 model, Thermo Fisher Sci entific, 
USA). The standards were serially diluted to attain dilutions 109, 108, 107, 
105 and 104 standards.  
 
The optimum annealing temperatures (T a) for the individual primer pairs were 
determine using a thermal gradient of annealing temperatures in paral lel PCR 
amplifications and subsequent melt curve analysis (see below) to determine 
amplification specificity. To determine the Temperature range for the analysis 
the estimated T m of primers were considered and temperatures below and 
above these estimated T m values were tested.  
 
The qPCR reagent used was the SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR® Green 
Supermix (Bio -Rad, UK), which consists of a mixture of polymerase, dNTPs, 
MgCl2, buffer and SYBR green. Amplification was performed using a CFX96 
Real-Time system, whi ch is a PCR thermal cycler that has thermal gradient 
feature.  CFX96 Real -Time system is operated remotely using the BioRad’s 
CFX Manager Software . PCR reactions occurred in 96 - well plates (BioRad 
UK) consisting of 200 μl wells covered with an optically c lear cover (Bio -Rad 
UK). In each well the reaction mix consisted of 5 μl of SsoAdvanced™ 
Universal SYBR® Green Supermix, 0.5 μl of reverse and forward primer 
(concentration of 10 picomoles per primer), 1 μl of PCR -grade water and 3 μl  56 of template. A range of annealing temperatures was tested for each primer set 
and temperature range varies between primers but temperatures are within 50 
to 70 oC. Each PCR cycle consisted of denaturation, annealing and elongation 
stages. Initially, the thermocycler Lid was he ated to 105 oC for 3 minutes to 
activate the polymerase enzyme. This step was followed by 40 cycles of 10 
seconds denaturation at 95oC and a combination of 30 seconds annealing at 
the varied temperature within the range specified. Subsequently, a melt curv e 
analysis was carried out between 55 and 90 oC at increments of 0.5 oC at every 
30 seconds. Specific amplification is attained when only one peak is present 
on the melt curve. Conversely, non -specific binding of primers is detected 
when 2 or more peaks ar e visualised on the melt curve. The optimal Ta is the 
temperature, which has the lowest quantification value (C q value) and specific 
amplification of a single amplicon peak. C q-values are that cycle when 
amplification has reached its threshold; at this cyc le, the fluorescence exceeds 
the background fluorescence, hence, quantification ensues. To further verify 
that correct amplicon were produced during amplification an agarose gel 
analysis was also carried out to visually view the amplicon size of PCR 
produc t.  
 
A standard curve analysis was carried out to determine the efficiency of 
amplification across a range of concentrations of the target sequence. To this 
end, a set of standards made of known concentrations of the target gene and 
prepared by serial dilu tion was subjected to qPCR to generate a standard curve. 
The standard curve is basically the plot of the C q-values plotted against the log 
of the standard concentration. The resultant linear equation which can be fitted 
to the plot, is:  
 
Cq = K Log ( No) + Cq1  
Where   
K=slope  
No= initial copies of 
DNA  
         Cq1  = interception of the 
curve  
  57 PCR efficiency is calculated from the slope of the curve with the equation  
 
  E = 10-1/k  -1 
 
For an acceptable qPCR assay, amplification efficiency is expected to have 
values between 80 and 115 % (Callbeck et al., 2014). Furthermore, a 
correlation coefficient (r2) of the standard curve above 0.95 is desirable 
(Callbeck et al., 2014).

Development and optimization of qPCR assays for 
Hydrocarbon degrading t axa enriched in the oil degrading 
experiments  
 
3.1.  Introduction  
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to determine the absolute bacterial 16S 
rRNA gene abundances in the experimental microcosms detailed in chapters 4, 
5 and 6. Critically, theses abundances w ere determined in both the original 
soils and the microcosms variably amended with oil and heavy metals to 
determine the level of enrichment of total bacterial abundances and specific 
taxa that had occurred during the incubation period. To achieve this, qP CR 
assays that targeted the 16S rRNA genes of the bacterial domain or specific 
genera of major hydrocarbon degraders (identified from ion torrent PGM 
analysis) were designed and or applied to microcosm DNA extracts.  
 
This chapter describes in detail the s teps taken to design the primers, which 
targeted different OTU sequences, enriched during hydrocarbon degradation 
and validate the resultant qPCR assays.  
 
3.2.     qPCR assay Target  
The major hydrocarbon degrader enriched based on OTU sequence frequency 
in the oil and Ni and the oil and Cd amended microcosms, based on BLAST 
and RDP sequence match, was closely related (between 97 to 100% 
similarities) to strains of Rhodococcus sp  (see chapters 4 and 5). In the same 
vein, the major OTU enriched in Pb contamin ated (both long term and short 
term Pb contamination) oil -amended soil microcosms was closely related to 
strains of the order Bacillales  (100% similarity, see chapter 6). At the genus 
level, the predominant OTU was 98% similar to Scopulibacillus darangshie sis 
(DSM 19377) and Anaerobacillus arseniciselenatis  (DSM 15340) and 97% 
related to strains of varied genera including Bacillus , Anaerobacillus , 
Volcanobacillus , Pullulanibacillus , Salinibacillus , Virgibacillus , Salirhabdus  
Anoxybacillus , Thalossobacillus , Microaerobacter , Listeria  and 
Staphylococcus . Due to these close relatives of various genera of Bacillales,  59 primers were designed to target the order Bacillales  in Pb amended petroleum 
degraded communities instead of a particular genus.  
 
For both 16S rRNA  assay targets, phylogenetic affiliations of target OTUs 
were determined using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis 
software version 6 (MEGA 6) (Tamura et al. 2013). This analysis (see 
chapters 4, 5 and 6) compared both closely and more distantly r elated 
sequences with the target OTUs by the construction of phylogenetic trees 
(Kumar et al. 1994; Tamura et al. 2011). These trees were then used to select 
16S rRNA gene sequences to augment the 16S rRNA sequence library with 
representative sequences fro m the target and non -target groups.  
 
3.3.    Primer Design  
Primers employed in the qPCR assays and developed in this study were 
designed using the PRIMROSE Software (Ashelford et al. 2002). PRIMROSE 
is a relatively old computer program designed to identify  16S rRNA probes 
and PCR primers for use as phylogenetic  and ecological tools in the 
identification and enumeration of bacteria (Ashelford et al., 2002). 
PRIMROSE was designed to work closely with a relatively small 
downloadable database from an earlier ve rsion of the Ribosomal Database 
Project specifically RDP release 8 (Ashelford et al., 2002). This database, 
however, was augmented by desired target and non -target sequences (which 
were >1200 bp) sequences ( see tables 3.1 and 3.2) retrieved from the more u p 
to date RDP release 11. These assembled sequences in conjunction with 
sequence file(s) from the OTU target identified by sample sequencing was 
used to create oligonucleotides that potentially target 16S rRNA genes 
fragments of specific taxonomic groups o r individual taxa.  
 
In determining the suitability of oligonucleotides as primers required for PCR 
optimisation, a set of rules outlined by Innis and Gelfand (1990) were 
followed. First, the oligonucleotide length should be between 17 and 28 bp. 
Secondly,  the G+C content of the oligonucleotide should be between 50 and 
60%. Also, the optimal melting temperature (Tm) should be between 55 and 
80 oC.  The 3’ end of the oligonucleotide is also a very important feature of 
the oligonucleotide and a set of guideli nes are provided to obtain desired  60 features thereby preventing mispriming. The Innis and Gelfand’s guidelines 
point out that the base at the 3’ end should be either G or C. However, G or C -
rich ends consisting of a run of 3 or more Gs or Cs should be avoid ed. It is 
also important that the bases at the 3’ -end are not complimentary to each 
other. Complimentary bases at the 3’ -end of primers promote non -specific 
binding that results in primer -dimer amplification thereby reducing the desired 
yield. Another feat ure that could result in non -specific pairing is the presence 
of palindromic sequences within the oligonucleotide and this should be 
avoided while considering potential primers.  
 
Primers were designed to specifically target Rhodococcus  and Bacillales  
group s closely related to enriched sequences in microcosms and 
oligonucleotides were chosen after careful considerations following Innis and 
Gelfand’s guidelines. The primers generated are described in table 3.3 below.  
 
 
3.4.     Primer pair selection and vali dation   
To validate the specificity of different primer pair combinations, primers 
sequences were analysed in pairs using the RDP release 11 ProbeMatch tool 
(https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/probematch/search.jsp). ProbeMatch determines the 
sequences within the RD P database that match the submitted oligonucleotides. 
The pairs are submitted with one pair in a reverse complemented form 
(submitted as probe negative strand). Running the ProbeMatch tool 
determined the specificity of primer pairs in combination and not j ust the 
specificity of the individual component oligonucleotides.  Potentially useful 
primer pairs were chosen principally based on their giving the least number of 
hits within the non -target taxonomic groups. While considering the primer 
pairs for a qPCR assay, it is important to identify the annealing position of 
primers on the target gene in order to determination amplicon length. This 
property was determined using the PRIMROSE software during primer design 
but was cross -checked manually against download ed target sequences. 
Identifying the position of primers is essential For qPCR assay optimisation as 
efficient primer pair combinations should produce amplicons with fragment 
sizes between 50 bp and 250bp (Thornton and Basu 2011; Price et al. 2011).

When possible primer pairs were matched against the RDP Database release 
11 the database comprised 3,224,600 archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA gene 
sequences as well as 108,901 fungal 23S rRNA sequences. The bacterial 16S 
rRNA gene database comprised 3,070,243  sequences. Probe match was 
carried out in the entire database and the target taxonomic groups were 
bacterial order, Bacillales  and bacterial genus, Rhodococcus . Primer pairs 
were analysed for specificity to these target taxonomic groups. Table 3.4 
shows t he result of the ProbeMatch analysis of primer pairs.

  65 The order Bacillales  and the genus Rhodococcus  belong to the bacterial 
phylogenetic groups Firmicutes  and Actinobacteria , respectively. The RDP 
ProbeMatch tool presents output -results/ hits in a Hierarchal format; hence , 
the number of matched sequences at all taxonomic levels are identified, from 
the domain to genus level. The percentage of hits from target groups (at order 
or genus level as the case may be) relative to the bacterial hits is a measure of 
specificity. A h igh percentage implies a high specificity for the target (see 
table 3.2). Based on this % specificity and amplicon fragment length, 2 
primers sets were considered for use in the enumeration of 16S rRNA genes of 
target Rhodococcus  sp. in Ni or Cd and/or oil -amended microcosms detailed 
in chapters 4 and 5. In the same vein, a single primer set was considered for 
Bacillales  enumeration in the Pb and oil -amended microcosms (see chapter 6). 
The optimisation of these qPCR assays using selected primer set is discu ssed 
in the section 2.8.7.  
 
3.3: Selected Primer sets employed in the qPCR assay optimisation for 
bacterial 16S gene abundance determination  
Following the ProbeMatch analysis, primer sets that have high % specificity 
for target groups, 2 primer sets for Rhodococcus  (RhO1390F -RhO1454R and 
RhO53F -RhO189R) and 1 primer set for Bacillales  (Bac537F -Bac702R), were 
analysed further towards optimisation of qPCR assays. The comparative 
analysis of the primer pairs that targeted 16S rRNA gene targets for 
Rhodococcus  indicated that the RhO1390F -RhO1454R primer pair was a 
better primer set than RhO53F -RhO189R. Analysis of the later (Fig 3.1), 
indicated that the lowest Cq -value was attained at a T a of 61.4 oC. A melt 
curve analysis (Fig 3.2a) of the curve generated at 6 1.4 oC, however, indicated 
that incomplete amplification of target sequence within the 40 cycles occurred 
see figure 3.2 a and b). From figure 3.2a, it could be observed that not all 
samples attained the maximum peak. Most peaks of samples are slightly abo ve 
or below the baseline level. Also, standard curve analysis used only two data 
points of standard samples out of 6 standard samples, to attain an efficiency of 
79.2% and R2 of 0.92. A lower T a at 59 oC resulted in the amplification of 
non-specific PCR pr oducts (see figure 3.2 c and d) and on increasing Ta to 
63.3 oC, no amplification of the target sequence was observed (see figure 3.2 
e).  66 For the RhO1390F -RhO1454R primer pair a thermal gradient -melt curve 
analysis indicated that the optimal T a was 58.1 oC (see figure 3.3) however, 
amplification of standard dilutions using this temperature as the Ta resulted in 
non-specific amplification (see figure 3.4 a), which was reflected in a low 
amplification efficiency of 76% (Figure 3.4b). However, increasing the T a to 
62oC resulted in a higher amplification efficiency of 81.9% (figures 3.4c and 
d) and non -specific amplification.  Based on these results, RhO1390F -
RhO1454 was accepted as the primer set for the enumeration of 16S rRNA 
gene in samples at T a of 62 oC.  Agarose gel electrophoresis visually showed 
the amplified genes were the correct amplicon length (see figure 3.5). Also, 
the agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed specific amplification of target 
gene.  
 
In the same vain, validation analysis was carried out  for Bac537F -Bac702R 
that target species of the order Bacillales.  Figures 3.6 and 3.7 present the 
results of the analysis. The thermal gradient - melt curve analysis indicated that 
the lowest Cq was attained at 62 oC (see figure 3.6). As shown in figure 3. 7b, 
there was no amplification of now - targets sequences at this annealing 
temperature. The efficiency of amplification was 86% and the R2 was 0.99 
(see figure 3.7a). In addition, RT -PCR analysis at an annealing temperature of 
65 oC also resulted in non -specific amplification but the amplification 
efficiency at this temperature was much higher at 106% and the R2 of the 
standard curve was 0.95 (see figures 3.7 c and d). This observation suggests 
that annealing temperature within the range of 62 to 65 oC is v alid for the 
amplification 16S rRNA of species belonging to the order Bacillales. In this 
project, the enumeration of 16S rRNA genes of Bacillales in the aerobic 
petroleum degrading metal contaminated soils was carried out at Ta of 65 oC. 
Agarose gel elect rophoresis confirmed specific amplification of genes with the 
appropriate amplicon size (see figure 3.8).

3.6.     Application of 16Sr RNA gene abundance in pe troleum degrading -
heavy metal contaminated aerobic soil microcosms  
Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) targeting 16S rRNA gene sequences was 
used to determine the abundances of the total bacterial population and key 
organisms, which appeared to be enriched in  the microcosms from community 
analysis and thus could be considered to be involved in aerobic hydrocarbon 
degradation. Based on sequence match analysis using the RDP database, the 
dominant organisms enriched are 100% similar to strains of Rhodococcus  and 
Bacillales . 
 
The bacterial primers used were those previously designed and applied in the 
quantification of 16S rRNA gene in metagenomic oil degrading sediment 
microcosms (Gray et al. 2011). In addition, specific primers that targeted 
Rhodococcus  and Bacil lales  previously validated (see sections 3.1 to 3.) were 
used to enumerate the 16S rRNA genes of target taxonomic groups.  
 
The enumerations of 16S rRNA genes are possible by calibration with 
standards, which consist of known quantity of 16S rRNA gene of t arget 
taxonomic group. The standard used for bacteria was purified 16S rRNA gene  75 of Syntrophic  sp from an environmental sample (Gray et al. 2011). Other 
standards were as described in the section above. Preparation of standards was 
also as describe in the section above. Using the PCR protocols developed 
above, gene abundances were determined against the standards.  
 
Two approaches have been developed by scientists to determine the absolute 
abundance of target genes in samples.  These are the  standard curve m ethod 
(Roberts et al. 2014; Schriewer et al. 2011; Fronhoffs et al. 2002; C. Lee et al. 
2006; Larionov et al. 2005; Rutledge and Côté 2003) and one -point calibration 
method (Brankatschk, Bodenhausen, Zeyer and Bürgmann 2012; Brankatschk, 
Bodenhausen, Zeyer  and Burgmann 2012; Ruijter et al. 2013).  
 
The standard curve method involves the generation of a standard curve from 
qPCR assay of serially diluted standards with known template concentration, 
which is the used to calculate the target gene concentration of the sample 
extracts. With such an approach the standard curve is generated from plotting 
of the log of template concentration (LogN 0) against the C q- values and the 
resultant linear regression can be used to convert sample C q-values into gene 
abundances . Critically this approach assumes that the PCR Efficiency, E, of 
the standard is equal to the E of all the samples, which may not be true due to 
the fact that standards are generated from pure cultures, unlike environmental 
samples. As a result, it has be en stated that efficiencies of qPCR assay are 
likely affected (Brankatschk, Bodenhausen, Zeyer and Bürgmann 2012) by, 
for example, the co -extraction of PCR inhibitors. Accordingly, in this project, 
determination of the absolute abundance of 16S rRNA genes in samples was 
also carried out using the one -point calibration (OPC) approach (Brankatschk, 
Bodenhausen, Zeyer and Bürgmann 2012; Brankatschk, Bodenhausen, Zeyer 
and Burgmann 2012).  This method involved the determination of individual 
amplification effic iency in samples, accounting for template -related variability 
of amplification efficiency. In this way, differences between amplification 
efficiency are corrected between samples and standards. To this end raw data 
from the qPCR, which is non -baseline, cor rected is exported into the 
LinRegPCR program. LinReg basically carries out a baseline correction on 
each individual sample and then regression analysis is used to determine a  76 PCR efficiency value for each individual amplification profile from the raw 
data and calculated from the equation  
 
E = (N A/ NB) 1/ (CqA-CqB) 
 
Where:  
NA and N B = amount of fluorescence at two arbitrary threshold points (A and 
B) along the exponential phase of an individual amplification profile and Cq A 
and C qB= corresponding Cycles at  points A and B.  
The gene copies in the sample template at the inception of qPCR, N 0 sample , is 
then calculated using the equation  
N0 sample  =  N 0 standard  * (E Standard  ^Cq standard / Esample ^ Cq sample ) 
 
Where  
N0 standard  =initial copies of template o f a defined standard,  
E sample = the efficiencies of the sample PCR amplification  
E Standard  = the average efficiency of standard PCR amplification , values and  
Cq sample  = the cycle threshold for sample  
 Cq standard  =Cycle threshold for Standard  
 
The 16 S rRNA gene abundance in samples was then calculated using the 
equation below  
 
 Copies (ng-1 DNA Extract g-1 dry soil) =  
N0 sample  * Dilution factor  
 
Concentration of DNA (ng ul-1 extract g-1 dry

Conclusions  
 The design of qPCR primer pairs tha t target the most dominant OTU 
sequences in  crude oil -metal (Ni, Cd and Pb) amended degraded soil 
microcosms and the optimization of qPCR assays that these sequences was 
described in this chapter.  Based on careful considerations of oligonucleotides  77 desig ned using PRIMROSE software from the sequences of Target OTUs and 
sequences of close relatives to Target sequence using Innis and Gelfand’s 
guidelines, temperature gradient analysis, melt curve analysis and standard 
curve analysis, primers that target were  designed and optimized successfully. 
RhO1390F -RhO1454 at T a of 62 oC was accepted as the primer set for the 
enumeration most dominant OTU which is closely related to strains of 
Rhodococcus Sp in Ni and Cd crude oil degraded soil microcosms while 
Bac537F -Bac702R at T a of 65 oC was accepted primer  set for the enumeration 
of most  dominant 16S rRNA gene closely related to strains of Bacillales in Pb 
crude oil degraded soil microcosm.  
For the absolute quantification of 16S rRNA genes in samples, one point 
caliberation (OPC) method was used to eliminate errors caused by differences 
between standards DNA  samples and DNA samples from Microcosms. Unlike 
Standard curve method where equal efficiency value is assumed, OPC method 
determines individual amplification eff iciency in samples.

The Effects of Nickel on the Biodegradation of Petroleum 
Hydrocarbon in the Soil  
4.1.    Introduction  
Nickel (Ni) is an element of group 10 in the periodic table. The atomic number 
and mass of the element are 28 and 58.71mg mol -1 respectively. With a 
density is 8.9 g/cm3 at 20 oC Ni can be described as a heavy metal. The 
oxidation states of the metal are predominantly 0 and +2. In certain conditions, 
Nickel also exhibits +1 and +3 oxidation states (Gonnelli and Giancarlo 2012). 
The most dominant species of inorganic nickel is Ni2+.  Nickel (Ni2+) can 
substitute alkaline and metallic cations such as Mg2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu2+ and 
Mn2+ in primary minerals (Kabata -Pendias 2007; Martin, I., Morgan, H., Jones, 
C., Waterfall , e. and Jeffries 2009).  
Ni exists predominantly in the earth crust as Fe -Ni molten core (up to 10% of 
global Nickel exists in this form) (Gonelli and Rennela, 2012). This is owed to 
its affinity to Iron. Furthermore, Ni has a high affinity for sulfur, hen ce, its 
existence as sulfide minerals such as pentlandite ([(Ni , Fe) 9S8]) , Millerite 
(NiS), Niccolite (NiAS) and Breithauptite (NiSb) (Martin, I., Morgan, H., 
Jones, C., Waterfall, e. and Jeffries 2009). Ni also exists as carbonate, oxide, 
phosphate and s ilicate minerals. A significant amount of Ni has also been 
observed in petroleum and coal and for years, Ni has been considered one of 
the primary heavy metal in petroleum. Ni concentration in petroleum varies 
with the petroleum source rock, ranging from f ew ppb to tens of ppm. The 
concentrations of Ni in different petroleum all around the world is shown in 
table 1.2 of chapter 1. The significant of Ni in petroleum has  lead to the use of 
its quantification (together with vanadium) in the geochemical studies  of 
petroleum (Barwise 1990). Usually, it exists in porphyrin form in the 
petroleum originating from its substitution of the metallic ions of natural 
porphyrins such as chlorophyll and bacteriophyll during petroleum formation 
(Peters et al. 2007a).  
Anthro pogenic sources of Ni have resulted in increases in the Ni content of 
soils. The main Ni sources are mining activities such as metal mining,  79 petroleum and coal mining (Gonnelli and Renella, 2013(Martin, et al., 2009). 
The accumulations of Ni in soils and s ediments due to continuous 
contamination with petroleum have been reported in the past from across the 
globe. For instance, Obiajunwa et al (2002) reported an accumulation of up to 
76 ppm in chronically contaminated soils in Niger Delta, Nigeria. Also, 122  
ppm Ni , and  89.3 ppm Ni were reported to accumulate in soils of Bahrain 
(Mandany et al 1994), et al. 2014 ) and  Kuwait (Al -Saleh and Akbar 2015) 
respectively. Other activities that contribute to Ni accumulation in the 
environment include the addition of fe rtiliser and heavy metal containing 
sludge.  
Ni has been identified as a potentially toxic element and its concentrations in 
the terrestrial and aquatic environments are therefore guided. Studies on Ni 
effects on human health suggest that the metal is a po tential toxin, mutagen 
and carcinogen (Cameron et al. 2011; Kodama and Ishinishi 1980; 
Schaumlöffel 2012; Barceloux 1999). In the UK, the soil guideline value for 
Ni is 130 parts per million (ppm) in residential areas, 230 ppm in allotment 
areas and 1800 p pm in commercial areas (Martin, I., Morgan, H., Jones, C., 
Waterfall, e. and Jeffries 2009).  
Ni has been reported as a co -factor for certain microbial enzymes.  Boer et al 
(2014) described some Ni -dependent enzymes. These include glyoxalase I, 
acireducton e dioxygenase, urease, superoxide dismutase, [NiFe] -hydrogenase, 
carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, acetyl -coenzyme A synthase/decarbonylase, 
methyl -coenzyme M reductase, and lactate racemase.  As co -factor to these 
enzymes, Ni becomes essential nutrient for t he physiological functions of 
microbes. This might explain the increased hydrocarbon degraders in soil by 
the range of 8.4 to 17.2%, resulting in a relative increase in gasoline 
biodegradation (57.5 –62.4%) (Agarry et al. 2013). Although essentiality of Ni 
to soil plants and microbes is known, its toxicity at high concentrations to 
plants and microbes has been well documented (Martin, I., Morgan, H., Jones, 
C., Waterfall, e. and Jeffries 2009; Cempel and Nikel 2006; Gadd 2010; 
Cameron et al. 2011; Korthals e t al. 1996; Weng et al. 2004; Sparks 2005; 
Kelly et al. 2010)  it is worth noting that this contaminant could, therefore,  
base on this preamble represent both a nutrient and a toxic component of a 
system and this is reflected in this chapter.   80 This chapter will discuss the effect of nickel on the biodegradation of 
petroleum hydrocarbons. The effect on soil respiration during biodegradation, 
the pattern of change in in the aliphatic component of petroleum during 
degradation and the effect on the microbial com munity during biodegradation 
are highlighted.  
4.2.     Aim and objective  
The aim of the experiments detailed in this chapter is to investigate the effect 
of Nickel on hydrocarbon degradation in complex natural systems using a 
microbial ecological approach combined with geochemical methods.  
The specific objectives were:  
1.    To determine the effect of different mineral forms of nickel at different 
concentrations on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon to determine 
likely thresholds of positive and ne gative impacts on hydrocarbon degrading 
bacteria  
2.    To simultaneously in the same experimental system determine the 
compositional changes of whole petroleum oil relative to imposed Ni 
contamination.  
3.    To simultaneously determine the ecological dive rsity and dynamics of 
microbial communities relative to variable petroleum hydrocarbon and Ni 
contamination.  
4.    To determine the geochemical fate of added Ni in its different added 
forms and interpret this fate in the context of the observed effect on 
hydrocarbon degradation and microbial communities.  
4.3.     Methods  
The effects of Ni on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons was 
studied in soil microcosms designed to simulate Heavy Metal -Petroleum co -
contaminated soils. The general experimental setup and geochemical and 
microbiological methods used have been described extensively in chapter 2 
but are briefly recapped here with the inclusion of specific details of the Ni 
amended experiments. The soil samples used were obtained from the 
organically  farmed section of the Nafferton ecological group farm described  81 extensively in section 2.1. Sampling methods, sample handling, pretreatment 
methods and storage methods were based on ISO guidelines (Standard 2003) 
as outlined in section 2.2. Initial soil p H, moisture content, water holding 
capacity, heavy metal content and organic carbon were determined as outlined 
in section 2.3.  
Soil microcosm treatments were set up in triplicate such that there were 
treatments of increasing Ni concentration in different mineral forms (see 
Figure 4.1). Ni effects were investigated at 12.5, 25, 50, 200 and 350 ppm. 
These concentrations were arranged around the environmental agency’s soil 
guideline value (SGV) for Ni as well as Dutch list contaminated land 
recommendations. I n addition, the Ni concentrations in real documented cases 
of Metal -petroleum contamination were considered as well. The SGV for Ni is 
130 ppm for residential areas, 230 ppm for allotment areas and 1800 ppm for 
commercial areas (UK Environmental Agency 200 9). As for the Dutch list, Ni 
concentration of 35 ppm is considered as the optimum soil value and 210 ppm 
as the action concentration in soils and sediments (see table 4.1). Furthermore, 
soluble Ni (NiCl 2), insoluble Ni (NiO) and organic Ni (Ni -Porphyrin ( Ni-
Porph)) forms of the metal were used for this investigation. Control 
microcosms consisted of either soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon 
but no added Ni (PHC) or soils without Ni or oil amendments. The third set of 
controls was set up to ascerta in the effect of the porphyrin without Ni on 
hydrocarbon degradation. In addition, soils were amended with porphyrins as 
controls for the Ni -porphyrin amendment. Petroleum degradation in these 
controls was compared with the Ni -Porphyrin amended microcosms.  Soil 
microcosms were incubated in the dark and at ~21 oC (i. e. room temperature) 
for 15 days.  
Microbial activity in all microcosms was determined by measuring CO 2 
accumulation (mmol CO 2 g-1 dry soil) in the headspace gas of microcosms 
determined by GC -MS (see section 2.4) at two -day intervals. Rates of CO 2 
production (mmol g-1 dry soil day-1) were then calculated from the maximal 
linear phase of CO 2 accumulation, which occurred after a short lag phase. 
Changes in n -alkane composition were determined (as outlined in section 2.7) 
in selected replicated microcosm treatments chosen on the basis of statistically 
significant differences in CO 2 production profiles. Variations in the means of  82 total n -alkanes components relative to other treatments and controls we re 
assessed by one way -ANOVA and individual means were compared by 
Fisher’s multiple pairwise comparison analysis. Also, experiments were 
compared with controls using the Dunnett’s pairwise comparison analysis.  
Furthermore, the fate of the added heavy met als in soil was determined by a 
sequential extraction Ni in Ni -Porph and NiO amended soils based on the 
methods by (Tessier et al. 1979). This method used was described in details in 
in section 2.5.  
The effects of Ni concentrations and mineral forms on th e changes in 
microbial community composition and diversity in the experimental oil 
degrading microcosms was analysed using microbiological molecular tools 
targeting the 16S rRNA gene. These methods have been described in section 
2.6 and included DGGE analy sis of PCR -amplified bacterial 16S rRNA gene 
fragments to determine the influence of experimental treatment effects relative 
to within treatment variations in community composition. Following DGGE 
analysis, studies based on the sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA gene 
fragments were carried out to obtain a greater understanding of the differences 
in the microbial community structures in the experimental microcosm 
treatments. For this purpose, 16Sr RNA genes of communities were sequenced 
using the ion torrent P GM sequencing methods. Due to the high 
reproducibility of communities identified from the DGGE analysis, 
representative samples were used in this analysis. Tagged 16S rRNA samples 
from 17 soil samples consisting of metal (Ni, Cd and Pb) petroleum degraded 
soils and controls, which were the petroleum amended, and unamended soils 
made up the clone library used for the ion torrent sequencing. The sequence 
data obtained were analysed using the MOTHUR and QIIME software to trim 
sequence data, cluster sequence da ta into OTUs, assign taxonomic groups to 
OTUs and analyse community diversity (alpha - and beta - diversity of 
communities). Sequence data were trimmed to recover sequences that have a 
minimum length of 300 bp, a maximum of 500 bp. and homopolymers lower 
than 7 bp were trimmed. Communities of the Ni -amended soils consisted of 6 
representative samples including Ni -Porph amended soils at 12.5, 50 and 350 
ppm Ni concentrations and NiO amended soils at 12.5, 50 and 350 -ppm Ni 
concentrations. Sequences of OTUs wer e, further, matched within the RDP  83 release 11 and BLAST databases to determine the closest relatives. Based on 
this match, the phylogenetic tree was generated using the MEGA 6.  
Furthermore, qPCR assays that specifically target the 16S rRNA gene of 
taxonom ic groups of interest was carried out to determine the abundance of 
the target taxonomic group in communities (see chapter 3). The target groups 
were general bacteria and Rhodococcus  (closest relatives ( 100% similar) to the 
predominant OTU in the oil degra ded communities).  
For the molecular microbial studies, a subset of samples was selected for 
analysis based on observed significant differences in microbial activities as 
determined by CO 2 production rates. Samples from soil microcosms 
contaminated with NiO  and Ni -Porph at Ni -concentrations of 12.5, 50, and 
350 ppm were used for Microbiological analysis. The oil only amended and 
unamended soils were also subjected to this investigation to compare with the  
test samples.

4.4.1. Chemical properties of soil  
Physicochemical analysis of the Nafferton soils, as presented in table 4.1, 
confirmed that  these soils samples were not initially contaminated with heavy 
metals. Specifically with respect to the subject of this chapter the results 
revealed that the average soil nickel concentration was 9.06 ± 0.64 ppm, 
which is below the recommendation values b y the UK Environmental 
guideline values and the Dutch list. In addition, the concentration values of 
other heavy metals were below their respective recommendation values (see 
table 4.1). With the average value of 7.13 ±0.03, the pH of the soil is 
approxima tely neutral.

This is within the range of typical soil organic matter content for arable soils 
(Hobson 1983) , therefore, this suggests t hat the soil was not contaminated 
with organic contaminants. Also, this soil has no history of contamination in 
the past. These results, therefore, imply that the soil is a typical pristine soil 
and is suitable for the experiment simulating an oil spill ev ent onto 
agricultural land.  
 
4.4.2. Soil microbial activities  
4.4.2.1. Lag and linear phase time comparison of oil -amended with 
unamended controls indicating the presence of HC degrading bacteria  
In oil -amended soil microcosms, lag phase period occurred at  the inception of 
degradation, followed by a period of maximum production, which resulted in a 
steep rise in CO 2 production and a period of reduced CO 2 production (see 
figure 4.2).

controls. The data points represent the mean cumulative CO 2 of triplicate samples in mmol  g-1 
dry soil. The error bars represent the standard error of triplicate samples. Graph legend 
indicates oil amended (oil only) and unamended (soil only ) controls .  a, b and c indicate the 
lag phase,  log phase and decelerating growth phase, respectively.  
  86  
The Analysis of Variance, ANOVA, and the Dunnett’s multiple comparison 
analysis were used to compare cumulative CO 2 in oil -amended and 
unamended contr ols. ANOVA identified that cumulative CO 2 produced in oil -
amended controls was significantly higher than the cumulative CO 2 produced 
in unamended controls (p=0.0007). While cumulative CO 2 in oil -amended 
controls increased from 0.00592 ± 0.000265 mmol g -1 dry soils on day 0 to 
0.478 ± 0.04 -mmol g -1 dry soils on the day 15, in unamended control, CO 2 
increased from 0.000559 ± 0.00018 mmol g -1 dry soils on day 0 to 0.064 ± 
0.018 mmol g -1 dry soils day 15.  The Dunnet’s comparison analysis 
identified that the di fference of means was 0.414 ± 0.0434 -mmol g -1 soils.  
To statistically determine the changes in cumulative CO 2 during degradation, 
cumulative CO 2, at 2 -day interval, was statistically compared using a 
combination of ANOVA and multiple pairwise comparisons analysis by 
Fisher’s test (which compared differences of means of cumulative CO 2 at 2- 
day interval during oil degradation). This way, discrepancies in the cumulative 
CO 2 produced at each observed period during degradation period were 
identified. Analyses revealed that no significant changes in cumulative CO 2 
occurred between day 0 and day 6 in oil -amended soils (p=0.36; differences in 
means =0.027 mmol g -1 soils). This implies that lag phases in microcosms 
were approximately 6 days. Successively, cumulativ e CO 2 increased 
significantly by 0.236 ± 0.0295 between day 6 and 8 (p<0.0001), and by 0.072 
± 0.0295 mmol g -1 soil between day 8 and 10 (p=0.024). This was followed 
by an increase in CO2 by 0.039 ± 0.0295 mmol g -1 soil within days 10 and 12, 
which was not  significant (p=0.207) and a slight increase by 0.097 ± 0.0295 
mmol g -1 between days 12 and 15 (p=0.005). However, in the unamended 
control, cumulative CO 2 observed on days 0 to day 12 were not significantly 
different (p=0.097). Moreover, means of cumulati ve CO 2 significantly 
increased by 0.058 ± 0.0017 mmol g -1 soils on day 15 (p=0.02).  
These observations coincided with figure 4.2. Also , the observations 
correspond to standard graphs of microbial population growth phases; lag -
phase (period of adaptation t o growth condition), log -phase (period of 
exponential growth) and decelerating growth phase (period of reduced growth) 
(GUNSALUS 1951; Mason and Egli 1993; Buchanan et al. 1997). The  87 significant differences in CO 2 production between oil -amended and no oil 
controls indicate the presence of hydrocarbon -degrading bacteria in oil -
amended soils. The increased proliferation of hydrocarbon degraders in the 
oil-amended soil accounts for the increased CO 2 production in the oil -
amended soils.  
 
4.4.2.2. The effect of Ni concentrations and Ni forms on the Lag and 
Linear phase time during petroleum degradation  
The CO 2 production profile in Ni -containing oil -degrading microcosms 
observed the periods of lag phase, log phase and decelerating growth as was 
seen in oil only c ontrol (see figures 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). However, differences 
were observed in microcosms’ CO 2 profiles. Cumulative CO 2 at the observed 
time during the period of degradation in experiment microcosms were 
compared with the controls using ANOVA and Dunnett’s m ultiple comparison 
methods to determine the differentiation in CO 2 production profile in Ni 
containing microcosms. ANOVA revealed that the CO 2 production profile 
observed in NiCl 2 contaminated soils, irrespective of Ni concentration, were 
not significantly  different from the Oil only control (p=0.545). Similarly, CO 2 
production profile in Ni -Porph containing soils, irrespective of concentration, 
were not significantly different from the oil only control. In contrast, ANOVA 
revealed that there were significa nt differences between the profile of oil only 
control and NiO containing soils (p=0.0014). Pairwise comparison of NiO 
soils with Oil only control revealed that while the CO 2 production profile of 
oil only control was not significantly different at 12.5, 2 5, 50,and 200 ppm Ni, 
at 350 ppm Ni (p=0.9255, 0.9256, 0.9836, 0.5353 respectively), CO 2 
production was significantly slower than production in oil only control 
(p=0.0006). Also, Dunnett’s pairwise comparison of NiO 350 ppm soil with 
soil only control reve aled that there was no significant difference in the CO 2 
production profile (p=1).   88

4.4.2.3. Effect of Ni on the maximum cumulative CO 2 during the 
degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon  
The maximum cumulative CO2 (observed on the 15th day of petroleum 
degradation) in experiment mi crocosms were compared with oil only amended 
and soil controls using ANOVA and Dunnett’s pairwise comparison methods. 
ANOVA revealed the chemical form of added Ni (p<0.0001) and the 
concentrations of Ni (p=0.03) influenced the maximum cumulative CO 2 in 
microcosms, significantly. Dunnett’s pairwise comparison of maximum 
cumulative CO 2 in Ni -porph contaminated soils with oil only control revealed 
that the maximum CO 2 at lower Ni concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 were 
significantly higher than the maximum cumu lative CO 2 in the control 
(p<0.0001; p=0.015; p=0.0079 respectively). However, at higher Ni 
concentrations of 200 and 350, there was no significant difference in 
maximum cumulative CO 2 relative to oil only control (p=0.13; p=0.30 
respectively). Also, in Ni Cl2 soils, ANOVA indicated that maximum 
cumulative CO 2, irrespective of concentration, were not significantly different  90 from maximum cumulative CO 2 of the oil only control. In addition, Dunnett’s 
pairwise comparison analysis identified no significant diffe rence between 
maximum cumulative CO 2 of NiCl 2 soils and oil only control. Furthermore, 
Dunnett’s pairwise comparison revealed that while Maximum cumulative CO 2 
were significantly lower than oil only control at high concentrations of 200 
and 350 ppm Ni in N iO soils (p=0.022; p<0.0001), there were no significant 
differences at 12.5, 25 and 50 ppm Ni -concentrations. Also, a pairwise 
comparison of NiO soils with soil only control revealed that there no 
significant difference in maximum cumulative CO 2 of the con trol and soils 
contaminated at 350 ppm (p=0.9986).  
4.4.2.4 Effect of Ni on the maximal rate of CO 2 production during the 
degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon  
The maximal rate of CO 2 production during degradation of petroleum was 
determined and analysed to determine the effect of Ni on the maximal rate of 
CO 2 production. Figure 4.6 shows a plot of maximal rates per treatment 
relative to oil -amended and unamended soils. The figure shows that the 
chemical form of added Ni influenced the effect of Ni amendment.  Ni-porph 
stimulated the maximal rate of CO 2 production relative to oil control, 
significantly (p<0.0001).

amended soil while soil only control indicates the unamended soil. Dotted line indicates the 
rate of oil -amended control; treatments with rates above the dotted lines are stimulatory while 
treatments with rat es below the dotted lines are inhibitory .  91 This stimulatory effect was highest at the lowest Ni amendment concentration 
(12.5 ppm) and was progressively less pronounced with increasing Ni 
concentration. Moreover, Dunnett’s pairwise comparison revealed that the 
while stimulatory effects on maximal rate of CO2 production were 
significantly higher than the oil control at 12.5 ppm (p<0.0001), 25 ppm 
(p=0.0179) and 50 ppm (p=0.0048), maximal rates of CO2 production were 
not significantly different at 200 ppm (p=0 .1462) and 350 ppm (p=0.2177) 
(see figure 4.7). Furthermore, maximal rates in NiCl2 contaminated soils, at 
all concentrations, were not significantly different from the maximal rates of 
the oil only control (p=0.3297; see figure 4.8). A different situation  was 
obtained in the NiO contaminated soils. Here, the rates of CO2 production 
decreased with increased Ni concentration. As a result, inhibitory effects on 
maximal rates of CO2 production were significantly high at 200 ppm 
(p=0.0314) and 300 ppm (p<0.0001 ) relative to oil only control (see figure 
4.9). However, maximal rates at lower concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 ppm 
were not significantly different from the oil only control (See figure 4.9).

4.4.2.5  Influence of porphyrin ligand of Ni -porph on the stimulation 
of petroleum hydrocarbon degradation   93 Given the nature of the Ni -Porph amendment, i.e. a Ni atom complexed to an 
organic porphyrin complexing ligand, there are two possible explanations fo r 
the observed stimulatory effect on CO 2 production, namely that Ni itself 
stimulated microbial activity or that degradation of porphyrin ligand might 
have influenced the stimulation of CO 2 production. To discriminate the 
influence of the porphyrin compone nt of the Ni -Porphyrin complex from the 
effect of the metal addition, porphyrin only amended experiments were set up 
and run concurrently as controls for Ni -Porph experiments. Figure 4.10 shows 
the maximal rates of CO 2 production in the Ni -Porph amended mi crocosms 
compared to their corresponding porphyrin -amended microcosms and oil -
amended soil control. ANOVA revealed that maximal rates of CO 2 production 
in Ni -Porph amended soils were significantly higher than their corresponding 
porphyrin controls (p=0.001 9). Furthermore, analysis by Fisher’s multiple 
pairwise comparison showed that maximal rates in the porphyrin controls 
were not significantly different from the oil only control (p=0.8858 for Porph 
A; p=0.2933 for Porph B and p=0.2414 for Porph C; where Po rph A, B and C 
are corresponding porphyrins containing controls to Ni -Porph treatments at 
12.5, 50 and 350 ppm Ni, respectively).  
These observations imply that amendment with porphyrin did not affect the 
rate of CO 2 production. Hence, CO 2 production was n either stimulated nor 
inhibited in the porphyrin amended soils. In addition, Fisher’s multiple 
pairwise comparison showed that while the maximal rates of CO 2 in Ni -Porph 
soils at 12.5 and 50 ppm Ni are significantly higher relative to the 
corresponding por phyrin control (p<0.0001 at 12.5 ppm and p=0.0316 at 50 
ppm), at 350 ppm Ni, corresponding porphyrin control was not significantly 
different (p=0.6676). These imply that possible porphyrin ligand degradation 
did not interfere with the stimulation of CO 2 production observed in Ni -porph 
amended soils at 12.5 and 50 ppm Ni -concentrations.  94

4.4.3. The fate and chemical association of Ni amendments after addition 
to the soil microcosms    
The distribution and chemical associations of Ni added as two amendment 
forms, NiO and Ni -Porph, was investigated in the soil microcosms by 
sequential extraction of metals from the soil. The choice o f these two Ni forms 
was because of their observed differences in behaviour relative to stimulation 
and inhibition of petroleum degradation in soils, which was entirely a different 
case for NiCl 2 contaminated soils where no significant effect on 
biodegrada tion was observed.  
Triplicate soil samples were contaminated with NiO and Ni -Porph at Ni 
concentration of 50 ppm and this was incubated at room temperature for 1 
week before the sequential extraction of added Ni using the Tessier’s 
sequential extraction me thod for partitioning developed for the partitioning of 
metals in soils and sediments (see section 2.7). Ni in the soils was partitioned  95 into associated soil fractions namely, fractions that were exchangeable, bound 
to carbonates, bound to Fe - and Mn - oxides, bound to organics and residual 
fractions of soils (see figure 4.11).  The investigation revealed that generally, 
the majority of the added Ni were associated with the organic and residual 
fractions. Organic fractions of soils may include living cells/ organisms, 
detritus, organic acids such as humic and citric acids, small molecular weight 
organic compounds such amino acids and proteins, soil organic contaminants 
such as petroleum hydrocarbon and PAHs while the residual fractions include 
metals embedded  in the crystal structure of the primary and secondary 
minerals.  
The individual concentrations of Ni recovered in the five fractions were 
determined and compared using ANOVA and pairwise comparison by 
Fisher’s multiple comparison tests. In NiO containing s oil, ANOVA showed 
that the concentrations of Ni in the different fractions of the soil partitioning 
varied significantly (p<0.0001).  Undetectable concentration levels of Ni 
(<0.001 ppm) were identified as exchangeable fractions and carbonate 
fractions. In  addition, 6.96 ± 1.05 % of added Ni was associated with Fe - and 
Mn-oxides relative to the total Ni -concentration added to the soil.  
Also, while 26.267 ± 1.053 % of added Ni was bound to soil organics, 48.64 ± 
5.82 % of added Ni was recovered from soil res iduals. Fisher’s pairwise 
comparison analysis showed that the residual fraction was significantly higher 
than the organic fractions by 11.189 ± 2.867 ppm Ni -concentration (p=0.0029). 
Similarly, the majority of added Ni were associated with soil organic and  
residuals in Ni -Porph containing soils, while, 22.56 ± 0.35 % of added Ni 
were associated soil organic 56.79 ± 2.68 % was recovered as residual. In 
addition, undetectable Ni concentrations were recovered as exchangeable and 
carbonate associates. Also, 2.5 2 ± 0.35% of added Ni was recovered as Fe -  96 and Mn -oxide associates.

4.4.4. Geochemistry of degraded soil microcosms  
4.4.4 .1    Degradation of n -Alkanes in microcosms  
The residual petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil microcosms c ontaminated 
with NiO and Ni -Porph at 12.5, 50 and 350 ppm were recovered after the 15 -
day incubation period and were analysed by GCFID. Specifically, the n -
alkanes were isolated and quantified in microcosms to ascertain the degree of 
petroleum degradation in microcosms. The n -alkanes identified in the 
recovered oils were mostly within the range of n -C12 to n-C32. The n -alkane 
profile varied between treatments depending on the degree of petroleum 
degradation (see figure 4.12). The extraction process loses th e light 
hydrocarbons, i.e. n -C5 to n-C10 or sometimes, nC 11), which are known to be 
present.  Typically, n -C12 to n -C32 makeup ~10% of total petroleum 
hydrocarbon (Singh et al. 2014). Their quantification, together with pristane 
and phytane, presents a rea listic analysis of the extent of petroleum 
degradation which will occur in short -term incubations of the type described 
in this study (Head et al. 2006). In this experiment, 100 mg of petroleum was 
used to amend microcosms. Hence, it is expected that the n -alkanes consist of  97 ~10 mg of the added petroleum. However, analysis of undegraded oil revealed 
that n -C11 to n-C32 consisted of approximately 8.6% of the crude oil used to 
amend microcosms. The t otal n -alkanes ranged from 828.1 ± 618.5 to 5203.6 
± 1651.8 μg (see figure 4.13). This wide range indicated variation in 
petroleum degradation influenced by metal forms and concentrations.  
The Total n -Alkanes recovered per treatment microcosm, which was 
determined by the summation of identified n -alkanes were comp ared with 
undegraded crude oil and the oil only controls (see figure 4.13). ANOVA and 
Dunnett’s pairwise comparison was used to statistically identify discrepancies 
between recovered TPH of treatments and controls.  
Interestingly, ANOVA revealed that total  n-alkane was significantly 
influenced by the Ni concentration (p= 0.0046) but not Ni form (p= 0.6279).  
ANOVA of the TPH recovered from experiment microcosms and oil only 
amended control relative to undegraded oil showed that there was significant 
degrada tion of whole crude oil during the period of degradation in the soil 
microcosms (p=0.0002). Pairwise comparison using Dunnett’s test revealed 
that total n -alkane of experiment microcosms was significantly lower than the 
undegraded crude oil (p<0.005) excep t NiO 350 ppm microcosm, which 
showed no significant difference with undegraded crude oil (p=0.1398). This 
observation implies that degradation of whole petroleum was inhibited in NiO 
contaminated microcosm at 350 ppm and corresponded with the results from  
CO2 production experiment.  
To identify the influence of Ni amendment on the total n -alkane recovered 
after degradation, Dunnett’s pairwise comparison test was used to compare 
each of the different Ni -treated microcosms with the oil only control. Analysis 
revealed that total n -alkanes recovered in Ni -Porph at 12.5 ppm Ni 
concentration were significantly lower than that obtained at oil only control 
(p=0.0484). However, in contaminated soils, no significant differences in 
recovered TPH were observed at 50 ppm  and 350 ppm relative to oil only 
control (p= 0.078 and 0.973 respectively). Also, Dunnett’s pairwise 
comparison analysis revealed that in NiO containing soils, at 12.5 ppm, total 
n-alkane was significantly lower than total n -alkane in the oil only control  by 
2.136 ± 0.5972 ppm. However, there is no significant difference between NiO  98 amended microcosm at 50 ppm and oil only control. At 350 ppm, total n -
alkane was significantly higher than oil only control. This observation 
suggests that stimulation of crude  oil degradation occurred at lower 
concentration relative to the oil only control and stimulation decrease d with 
increased concentration.  
4.4.4.2. Pattern of n -alkane degradation in microcosms  
To understand the pattern of n -alkane degradation, n -alkanes id entified in 
microcosm extracts were grouped into 3 categories comprising a low 
molecular weight group (nC 12-nC18), a medium molecular weight group (nC 19-
nC25) and a high molecular weight (nC 26-nC32) group. Quantification revealed 
that pooled concentration of low molecular weight group was less than 
medium molecular weight group, which was equally less than High molecular 
weight group in all microcosms. Hence, the more the molecular weight, the 
more the concentration of n -alkane. ANOVA was evaluated to disti nguish the 
groups. The analysis revealed significant differences between the groups of n -
alkanes observed (p<0.0001). In addition to this, Dunnett’s comparison tests 
for differences in means revealed no significant differences between low 
molecular weight and medium molecular weight groups (p=0.12).  
However, comparison of high molecular weight group with low and medium 
molecular weight groups indicated that total concentration of high molecular 
weight n -alkanes was significantly higher than total concentrat ions of lower 
and higher molecular weight n -alkanes. Thus, lower molecular weight and 
medium molecular weight n -alkanes were preferentially degraded prior to the 
degradation of the higher molecular weight n -alkanes. Dunnett’s comparison 
revealed that apart  from microcosms amended with NiO at 350 ppm Ni, the 
pattern of degradation was similar across treatments. This corresponds to the 
results recovered TPH and n -alkane/ isoprenoid ratios, which showed that 
little if any degradation occurred on amendment  of soil with NiO at 350 ppm  
Ni.

4.4.5. Effect of Ni on Microbial community diversity  
4.4.5.1. Denaturing gel electrophoresis indicating the microbial 
communities influenced by Ni -amendment and the reproducibility of 
communities  
A range of molecular techniques was used to study the dynamics of microbial 
community diversity and phylogeny in response to the different experimental 
treatments.  Initially a PC R-DGGE approach was used to identify variations in 
patterns of bacterial diversity change within and between the different 
experimental treatments and correlate these patterns with the measured 
differences in gas flux and oil chemistry described above. The  results from 
this DGGE analysis were also used to inform selection of samples for 
subsequent next generation sequencing.  
Simple visual inspection of the DGGE fingerprints of amplified bacterial 16s  101  rRNA gene fragments from soil DNA extracts (figure 4.14) revealed diverse 
bands amplified from all the soils analyse d indicating the presence of a broad 
range of bacterial species including those with low GC -content and those high 
GC-content. These profiles also indicate a high degree of reproducibility 
between experimental replicates allowing clear identification of treatment 
related effects on community diversity. Comparisons of the unamended soil 
control with contaminated soils showed selective enrichment of some species 
of microbes in contaminated soils deter mined based on the intensity of bands. 
Although enrichments were observed in most petroleum contaminated soils 
(see figure 4.14), an exception was obtained in microcosm contaminated with 
NiO at Ni -concentration of 350 ppm, which appear to have fingerprint 
comparable with the unamended soil only control. The enrichment of species 
in soils was influenced by Ni -presence and meal effects depend on chemical 
form of added Ni and concentration. While a few bands which are 
reproducibly present in the oil only do no t seem so enriched in the Ni 
treatments there are much more dominant enrichment of a band in Ni 
treatments which although appearing in the oil only is less dominant. These 
observations indicate evidence of the impact of metal toxicity on the diversity 
of the HC degraders enriched and enrichment and evidence of Ni -effect on 
selected specie growth.     
Further elaboration in the community structure differences using 
multidimensional scaling (MDS) plotted with Bray -Curtis similarity matrix 
overlaid with simila rity contour generated from clustering analysis revealed 
clustering of microcosms contaminated with same Ni -form at 40% similarity 
(see figure 4.15). This plot also revealed the entire communities cluster within 
20% similarity.  
The analysis of the similar ities (ANOSIM), carried out using Primer 6 
software, revealed significant separation/differences between Ni forms 
(R=0.907; p=0.002) and moderate separation among Ni -concentrations 
(R=0.451; p=0.001). This implies that the microbial community structures of  
soils vary significantly in relation to Ni -form and concentration.

4.4.5.2. Qualitative analysis of sequencing data set used for the 
biodiversity study of microbial communities of Ni amended cru de oil 
degraded soil  
The ion torrent sequencing recovered high throughput sequence data set of 
492574 sequences. Sequence data from Ni -amended communities accounted 
for 211284 sequences that are approximately 42.89% of the sequence data 
from the clone libr ary (consisting of tagged 16S rRNA sequences from 17 
samples) used for sequencing with the average number of 35214 ± 8980 
sequences. The trimming of sequence data on Mothur resulted to the omission 
of ~33% of the raw sequence data, reducing the sequence re covery to a total 
141404 sequences and an average sequence count of 23567 ± 5963 sequences  104  (see table 4.2).  
The number of sequences recovered from the oil amended control was 25,278 
sequences before trimming. After trimming, the number of sequences 
recove red was 21,315 sequences. However, 19,937 sequences was recovered 
from unamended soil control before trimming and 17,343 sequnces after 
trimming.  
For further analysis on mothur software, sequences were normalised to 8000 
sequences per sample (the highest n umber of sequences mothur could analyse 
without crashing). Also, for QIIME analysis, sequences were normalised to 
13500 sequences per sample; reasonably the least sequence count obtained 
considering all 17 samples analysed.

4.4.5.3. OTU -base studies on the influence of Ni on the community 
diversity of oil degraded soil microcosms  
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) generated using the average Neighbor 
clustering method based on 97%  similarity cutoff of 8000 16S rRNA 
sequences were analyse d to determine the alpha diversity; species richness, 
Shannon Evenness (E H’), and Simpson’s diversity (λ) were evaluated using the 
mothur (Schloss et al. 2009) platform (table 4.3). These estimators of diversity 
evaluated established microbial species diversity in communities and the 
degree of dominance of communities by species in crude oil containing 
microcosms with or without Ni.  
The species richness was established by determining the number of observed 
OTUs in communities. Generally, 16382 OTUs were observed in the whole 
library analysed. Of these, 1676 and 2457 OTUs were obs erved oil only  106  amended control and soil only control were, respectively. This implies that 
dominance of microbial community by hydrocarbon degraders in the oil -
amended soil was 46.70% relative to the unamended soil.  
Furthermore, the number of observed OTUs  in Ni -Porph amended soils at 12.5, 
50 and 350 ppm Ni were 1506, 1412 and 1610 OTUs respectively implying 
that the dominance of communities by hydrocarbon degraders were 11.29 %, 
18.70 %, 4.10 % more at 12.5, 25 and 350 ppm respectively, relative to oil 
only control.  More so, the number of OTUs in NiO amended soils at 12.5, 50 
and 350 ppm Ni were 2025, 1782 and 2308, respectively implying that relative 
to oil only control, dominance of communities by hydrocarbon degraders were 
17.24 %, 5.95 % and 27.38 % l ower in NiO amended soils at 12.5, 50 and 350 
ppm Ni, respectively. These observations suggest that microbial diversity in 
communities are influenced by the chemical form of added Ni. While Ni -
Porph amendment improved hydrocarbon dominance in communities, NiO 
amendment decreased hydrocarbon dominance of degraders in communities.  
The evenness of community species was determined using EH’.  The E H’ 
value s in are usually between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating perfect community 
species unevenness ( i. e. a perfect do minance by a species) and 1 a perfect 
community species evenness (a perfect heterogeneous community). The E H’ of 
oil-amended soil and unamended soil controls are 0.710628 and 0.874792, 
respectively. This implies that the dominance of species (hydrocarbon 
degraders) in oil -amended soils were 23.10 % higher relative to unamended 
soil. To clearly establish the effect of Ni on community species evenness, E H’ 
in Ni amended soils were compared with the oil only amended soil control. 
The E H’ of Ni -Porph amended so ils were 0.62582, 0.564626, and 0.6365 at 
12.5, 50 and 350 ppm Ni, respectively. This implies that relative to oil only 
control, dominance by hydrocarbon degraders increased by 13.55 %, 25.86 % 
and 11.65 % at 12.5, 50 and 350 respectively. On the other han d, E H’ of NiO 
contaminated soils, which were 0.764972, 0.737043 and 0.873217 at 12.5, 50 
and 350 ppm Ni respectively, were lower by 7.10 %, 3.58% and 18.62% 
respectively. These observations imply that the chemical form of added Ni 
affects selective enrichm ent of species in communities with Ni -Porph 
effecting increase in selective enrichment and NiO effecting decrease in 
selective enrichment by community species.   107  Furthermore, λ determined in communities clearly identified the extent of 
selective enrichment o f species in communities by considering species 
richness and evenness. λ in oil only amended soil and soil only controls were 
0.051148 and 0.003842 respectively. These values of λ imply that community 
of the oil -amended control was 92.25 % more homogenous than the soil only 
control due to the selective enrichment of hydrocarbon degraders. Similarly, 
H’ of in oil only amended soil and soil only control were 0.00699 and 0.0075 
respectively implying that the homogeneity of communities was 7.29 % more 
in oil -amended soils. Indicating slight change in community diversity. 
Comparison of λ in oil Ni -Porph amended soil communities relative to oil 
only amended control indicated that with the λ values of 0.126888, 0.192441 
and 0.128645, homogeneity in communities were  59.69 %, 73.43 % and 
60.24 % more at 12.5, 50 and 350 ppm Ni respectively. However, relative to 
in NiO amended soil communities, with λ values of 0.033501, 0.033929 and 
0.004012, homogeneity in soils decreased by 52.68 %, 50.25 % and over 
100% at 12.5, 50  and 350 ppm Ni, respectively.  
In addition, the distinction between communities and controls was also tested 
using Yue and Clayton’s dissimilarity coefficient, θ  (see table 4.4). The value 
of θ ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 denoting a perfect similarity betwe en 
communities and 1 a perfect dissimilarity between communities.  Comparing 
communities of the oil -amended and unamended controls identified that there 
are dissimilarities in diversity between the communities of oil -amended soil 
control and soil -only cont rol (θ=0.946). In Ni -amended soils, the most similar 
community was observed to be Ni -porph at 12.5 ppm Ni (θ=0.15). While most 
of the communities of Ni -amended soils show similarity with oil only control, 
NiO 350 ppm Ni community was highly dissimilar to t he oil only amended 
control (θ=0.946) (see table 4.4 for other values of θ). More so, θ value 
obtained in NiO 350 ppm soil relative to soil -only control identified the high 
similarity between the two communities (θ=0.097158), while other 
communities show d issimilarity to soil only control (see table 4.4 for θ values).

4.4.5.4. Community diversity study; Ni effects on the diversity of 
hydrocarbon degrade rs in oil degraded soil microcosms based on 
phylogenetic analysis  
A Phylogenetic study of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was used to determine 
the key OTUs, which were present in the soil without and without Ni and oil 
amendment.   To further understand the d etails of species dominance pattern 
in the communities, the minimum number of OTUs that made up 50% of the 
relative abundance of communities was calculated per sample and 
interestingly a discriminatory pattern of dominance influenced by Ni -form and 
concent ration was observed. For instance, three (3), eight (8) and eleven (11) 
OTUs made were found to make up approximately 50% of the relative 
abundance of the communities in the Ni -Porph contaminated systems at 12.5, 
50 and 350 ppm Ni -concentrations respective ly. This clear evidence of the 
selective enrichment of a few OTUs greatly contrasted with the number of 
OTUs that made up 50% of the relative abundance of OTUs in the NiO 
contaminated systems where Fifty -eight (58), thirty -one 31 and one hundred 
and sixty -five (165) OTUs made up 50% relative abundances at 12.5, 50 and 
350 ppm Ni -concentration respectively. A comparison of these numbers with 
the number of OTUs (one hundred and seventy -three (173) calculated for the 
Soil only control revealed that no increase  in species dominance had occurred 
in the NiO contaminated soil at 350ppm. In the same way, a compa rison with 
the oil only control, which had a minimum of 28 OTUs making up 50% 
abundance of microbial species, indicates that nickel amendment influences 
petroleum degradation and that this influence depends on the chemical form or 
the Ni amendment.  
4.4.5.5. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of microbial communities of 
Ni-Crude oil amended soils relative to oil only amended soils and 
unamended soils  
Classificat ion of OTUs carried out using the Bayesian method by (Wang, 
George M. Garrity, et al. 2007) matches sequences against the Silva, RDP and 
greengenes reference files on the mothur and  QIIME platform revealed that 
the most dominant organisms in most oil amend ed systems irrespective of Ni  110  contamination with the exception of NiO amended community at 350ppm Ni 
and representing approximately 50% of the relative abundance of the 
community population per sample, included OTUs that are closely related to 
bacterial an d archaeal strains . The bacterial species that predominated 
belonged to members of 9 phyla. These were Actinobacteria , Firmicutes , α-, 
β-, γ-Proteobacteria , Verrucomicrobia , Bacteriodetes , Chloroflexi  and 
Acidobacteria  (see figure 4.16). The archaeal species were members of the 
Crenarcheota . Most importantly, an observable enrichment of Actinobacteria  
occurred in Ni -oil amended soil s and oil only contaminated soils. An 
exception was observed in the soil contaminated with NiO at Ni -concentration 
of 350 ppm, which was comparable to soil only control. A careful 
consideration of the relative abundances of the Actinobacteria  group in the 
petroleum contaminated soils revealed an observable increase in relative 
abundances, which were approximately or more than twice of the relative 
abundance in the soil only control. Further classification to genus level 
identified the most dominant OTU (OTU 1) in crude oil contaminated soil 
systems (with or without Ni with the exception of 350 ppm Ni, NiO soil) is 
closely related to the species of the genus Rhodococcus with 100% similarity 
(see figure 4.17). Analysing 8000 sequences per sample, OTU1 consisted  of 
approximately 36%, 43% and 35% in Ni -Porph contaminated microcosms at 
12.5, 50 and 350 ppm respectively. This result is comparable to that obtained 
in the soil control  amended with only oil , which has OTU1 comprising 
approximately 21% of the total sequ ences for that individual library. In the 
same vain, OTU1 represented approximately 17% and 15% in NiO 
microcosms at 12.5 and 50 ppm Ni -concentration respectively. Most 
interestingly, OTU1 consisted of less than 1% in microcosm contaminated 
with NiO at 350  ppm Ni -Concentration. This representation is similar to the 
result obtained for the soil only control library. These observations indicated 
that OTU 1 generally predominance in oil degraded soil is stimulated on 
amendment with Ni -porph. However, amendment  with NiO did not effect the 
stimulation of OTU1 dominance in microcosms. Infact, amendment with NiO 
at 350 ppm Ni hindered the dominance of OTU1.  
To identify the closest related strains of Rhodococcus  to OTU1, sequences 
were further analysed using the bas ic local alignment search tool (BLAST) 
and RDP sequence Match. This analysis revealed that OTU1 was very closely  111  related to strains isolated from hydrocarbon -contaminated and metal 
contaminated environments (see table 4.5). Some these close relatives that 
showed 100% similarity to OTU1 were R. erythropolis   (AJ576250) from 
Antarctica soil (Shivaji et al. 2004) , R. erythropolis DN1  (X79289) from 
Kazakhstan  soil polluted with crude oil (Shevtsov et al. 2013), Rhodococcus  
sp. YE1 ( EU293153) crude oil contamin ated soil (Cao 2007), Rhodococcus sp.  
Pi71  (AM110074) from benzene -contaminated groundwater (Fahy et al. 2006), 
Rhodococcus sp. SQ8  (DQ366088) from oil polluted soil (Nohit et al. 2006), R.

Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using the 
Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA 6) software. The sequences 
of closely and more distantly related strains identified in the BLAST analysis 
including Rhodococc us type sequences were aligned with the OTU1 sequence 
identified in this study and an evolutionary tree using the Neighbor -joining 
method was constructed (see figure 4.18).

4.4.5.6. Evidence of Ni -influence on selective enrichment of hydrocarbon 
degraders in soil  
Apart from the unequal enrichment of Rhodococcus  across all treatments, 
other evidences o f selective enrichment, which are influenced by soil 
treatments, were observed (see figure 4.17).  Enrichment with unknown 
Comamonadaceae, a β-proteobacteria, was observed in oil -amended control. 
However, enrichment of this bacterium is more pronounced in NiO amended 
soils at 12.5 and 50 ppm Ni (~2x enrichment in oil only control) but not in Ni -
Porph amended soil at 12.5 ppm Ni. Enrichment of unknown 
Comamonadaceae  in Ni -Porph amended soils at 50 and 350 ppm Ni is 
comparable to enrichment of the bacterium i n oil only amended soil. Also, 
Mycobacterium  was observed to be clearly enriched in oil only amended soil. 
Enrichment of Mycobacterium  is ~2X lower than enrichment in Ni -Porph 
amended soils relative to oil only control. However, in NiO soils, 
Mycobactrium  was rarely  enriched.   113

were used in this analysis. The percentage sequences represented relative to the number of 
sequences per treatment is indicated in bracke ts. The Legend indicates  the different genera 
represented in the microcosm . Others in the legend indicate the collective relative abundance 
of genera  with individual relative abundance less than 1%.  
 
Contrary to this is the selective enrichment of Nocardia , which was very 
prominent in NiO soils and oil only amended soils but not in Ni -Porph soils. 
Further observation showing selective enrichment, which was influenced by 
both Ni forms and concentrations, was the selective enrichment of 
Pseudomonas  in NiO ame nded soil at 50 ppm Ni.  Pseudomonas  was 78.6 % 
more enriched in NiO amended soil at 50 ppm Ni than enrichment in oil only 
amended soil. Also, enrichment in NiO at 12.5 ppm is 92.3% less than 
enrichment at 50 ppm. Compared to the Ni -Porph soils, enrichment  of 
Pseudomonas  is 71%, 66% and 60% less relative to NiO 50 ppm soil.  
Interestingly, Pseudomonas umsongensis  was clearly enriched in oil only 
amended and Ni -Porph amended soils, but was rarely enriched in NiO soils.   114

4.4.6. Absolute 16S rRNA gene abundances of general bacteria and 
Rhodococcus  in the microbial communities of degraded soil microcosms  
Oil contamination of soil environment has been found to affect the soil 
microbial populations by the enrichment of specific individual OTUs. The 
abundance of the 16Sr RNA gen e of bacteria in communities of Ni -oil 
contaminated soils and oil only amended and unamended controls were 
determined to assess the change in the bacterial population. This was carried 
out by qPCR assay, which targeted the 16S rRNA of bacteria in communiti es 
using the universal primer set, U1048f -U1371r (Gray et al., 2011). In addition, 
the relative abundance indicated that strains of Rhodococcus  sp dominated in 
the Ni -oil contaminated soil systems in the previous section. Based on this 
knowledge, a specifi c qPCR assay was developed to target the 16S rRNA gene 
of Rhodococcus  group (i. e. OTU1 sequences). Here, the des primer designed 
for Rhodococcus  quantification was RhO1390F -RhO1454R (see chapter 3, 
section 3.3). Quantification was carried out to clearly d etermine the Ni effect 
on soil bacterial populations during the biodegradation of crude oil in the soil. 
16S rRNA gene abundances were determined in each replicate of the 
microcosm treatments. The 16S rRNA gene abundances of treatments relative  116  to oil only  amended and unamended control are presented in figure 4.19.  It 
could be observed from the figure that the general 16S rRNA gene abundance 
of bacteria in most microcosms is comparable. On the contrary, the figure 
shows discrepancies in the Rhodococcal  16S rRNA gene abundances between 
treatments. Mean abundances were analysed using ANOVA followed by 
pairwise comparisons of means using the Dunnett’s comparison analysis to 
statistically identify the significance of the influence of amendments on the 
bacterial  and Rhodococcal  abundances in soils.  
4.4.6.1 Influence of oil amendment on Bacterial abundance in oil 
degraded soil  
Analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in oil -amended and unamended soils 
revealed that soil amendment with oil only increased the mean ab undance of 
bacterial 16S rRNA gene by 9.10 X 107 sequences relative to soil only control. 
This increased bacterial abundance could be attributed to the proliferation of 
hydrocarbon degraders in the oil -amended soils.  This increment in bacterial 
abundance was not significant (p=0.97).  
4.4.6.2. Influence of Ni on the bacterial abundance in oil -amended soil 
systems  
Ni influence on bacterial abundance due to oil amendment was investigated by 
comparing the mean abundance of 16S rRNA gene abundance in Ni amende d 
soils relative to the oil only amended. Generally, ANOVA revealed that there 
were no significant differences in mean abundance across treatments 
(p=0.192). In Ni -Porph amended soil at 12.5 ppm comparison analysis by 
Dennett’s method revealed that the mea n abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA 
gene in Ni -Porph amended soils at 12.5 ppm, which was 3.91 X 108 sequences, 
increased by 2.77 X 108 sequences relative to the oil only amended soil.  
However, at the higher Ni concentrations of 50 and 350, bacterial 16S rR NA 
gene abundance decreased by 2.25 X 106 and 6.76 X 107, respectively. 
Generally, Dunnett’s comparison analyses revealed that the bacterial 16S 
rRNA gene abundances in Ni -Porph soils were not significantly different 
relative oil only control (see figure 4 .19).  117  In NiO amended soils, the 16Sr RNA gene abundances at 12, 50 and 350 ppm 
were decreased by 5.34 X 107, 4.86 X 107 and 8.46 X 107 relative to oil only 
amended soil, respectively. These differences in bacterial abundance of Ni -
amended systems are not s ignificantly different with the oil only control (see 
figure 4.23).  
4.4.6.3. The influence of oil amendment on the absolute abundance of 
Rhodococcus in soils  
The amendment of soil with crude oil stimulated the proliferation of 
Rhodococcus in soils (see fi gure 4.17). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene 
abundance of Rhodococcus in oil only amended soil control relative to the 
unamended soil revealed that there was a significant increase in the abundance 
of Rhodococcus in oil -amended soils (p=0.043). While the mean  abundance in 
oil-amended soil was 2.84 X 10 7, in soil only control, the mean abundance of 
16S rRNA gene of Rhodococcus was 3.06 X 10 6 the difference in soil only 
control. Hence, mean Rhodococcus 16S rRNA gene abundance in oil only 
amended soil and soil only controls 4.46 X 10 7 + 1.52 X 10 7 sequences.  
4.4.6.4. The influence of Ni on absolute abundance of Rhodococcus in oil 
degraded soil microcosms  
To understand the effect of Ni amendment on Rhodococcus  abundance in oil 
degraded soils, Ni -oil amended so ils were analysed statistically relative to oil 
only control by using the ANOVA and Dunnett’s pairwise comparison 
analysis. ANOVA revealed the abundance of 16S rRNA gene of Rhodococcus  
differed significantly across treatments (p=0.0009). The analysis revea led that 
in soils amended with Ni -Porph at 12.5 ppm, the mean Rhodococcal  16S 
rRNA gene abundance was 8.82 X 107  ±2.33 X 10 7 sequences, which was 
higher than the mean abundance obtained in the oil only amended control by 
4.21 X 10 7 ± 2.10 X 10 7 sequenc es. Also, the mean 16S rRNA gene of 
Rhodococcus  in Ni -Porph amended soils at 50 and 350 ppm Ni were 4.49 X 
10 7 ±1.03 X 10 7 and 1.54 X 107 ±2.06 X 107, respectively. These were 
lower relative to the oil only amended soils by 1.12 X 106 ±2.10 X 107 and 
3.06 X 107 ± 2.10 X 107 sequences, respectively. Dunnett’s comparison of 
Ni-porph amended soils revealed that the differences observed per treatment  118  were not statistically significant relative to oil only control (p=0.183 at 12.5 
ppm; p= 0.9999 at 50 ppm; p=0 .3839 at 350 ppm) (see figure 4.20).  Also, the 
abundances of Rhodococcal  16Sr RNA significantly decreased with increased 
concentration of Ni (0.05)  
In NiO amended soils, the mean Rhodococcal  16S rRNA genes abundance at 
12.5 and 50 ppm were 5.97 X 10 6 ±3.84 X 10 5 and 9.72 X 10 6 ±7.55 X 10 6 
sequences, which were not significantly lower than the relative abundance of 
oil only control by 4.01 X 10 7 ± 1.72 X 10 7 and 3.63 X 10 7 ±1.54 X 10 7, 
respectively. In addition, at 350 ppm of NiO amended soil, the m ean 
Rhodococcal  16S rRNA genes abundance which was 8.4 X 10 5 ±5.24 X 10 4, 
was significantly lower by and 4.52 X 10 + 1.54 X 10 7 relative to oil only 
amended control (p=0.0485) (see figure 4.21). Also, the abundances of 
Rhodococcal  16Sr RNA significantly  decreased with increased concentration 
of Ni (0.05).

production rates, Total petroleum hydrocarbons recovered after 
degradation period, Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene abundances and 
Rhodococcus  16S rRNA Gene abundances  
The obj ective of this research work was to understand the influence of nickel 
on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon using a combined 
geochemical and microbiological approach. It was expected that by doing this, 
a detailed understanding of the biological process in soil microcosms will be 
obtained. So far, the results have been presented separately based on 
individual analysis techniques. An analysis of the correlation between 
variables determined in experiments was carried out to identify trends in the 
relationships between microbiological data and geochemical data. To achieve 
this, a matrix correlation analyses was carried out to determine the 
relationships between cumulative CO 2, maximal CO 2 production rate, and 
Total n -alkane recovered after degradation  period, Bacteria 16S rRNA gene 
abundance and 16S rRNA gene abundance of Rhodococcus  (see tables 4.6 and 
4.7). 
4.4.7.1. Correlation of 16S rRNA gene abundance (of bacteria and 
Rhodococcus ) relative to maximal CO2 produced during the degradation 
of petroleu m hydrocarbon in soil microcosms  
Figure 4.21 is a scattered plot representing the relationship between maximum 
cumulative CO 2 and Bacterial 16S rRNA abundance of soil microcosms. 
There is a very weak positive linear relationship between the two variables 
(r=0.59; p=0.04; r2=0.33). Based on this, spearman correlation rs was 
determined to explore the possibility of non -linearity the between the two 
variables. r s indicated that indeed there is a week relationship between 
bacterial abundance and cumulative CO 2 in microcosms (rs=0.21; p=0.65).  
However, the there is a strong positive linear between 16S rRNA gene 
abundance of Rhodococcus  and maximum cumulative CO 2 In soil 
microcosms, which is significant (r=0.82; p=0.02; R2 =0.68) (see table 4. 6). 
Hence, increase  in the abundance of Rhodococcus  results to an increase in the 
mineralisation of crude oil to CO 2. These observations imply that although 
there was a general increase in proliferation of bacteria due to increasing  121  abundance of hydrocarbon degraders in the soil microcosms, the dominance of 
the bacterial community by Rhodococcus  contributed significantly to the 
mineralisation of crude oil to 
CO 2.

and maximal rate of CO 2 production during the degradation of petroleum 
hydrocarbon in soil microcosms  
The Correlation analysis indicated that there i s a very weak linear positive 
correlation between 16S rRNA gene abundance of bacteria and the maximal 
rate of CO 2 production in microcosms (r=0.63; p=0.052; r2= 0.40). In addition, 
rs was determined to explore the possibility of the non -linear relationship  
between the 2 variables and the value of r s indeed indicated that the 
relationship between 16S rRNA gene abundance of bacteria and maximal rate 
of CO 2 production in microcosms was very weak and not significant (r s=0.27; 
p=0.56).  However, based on the cor relation coefficient determined (see table 
4.6), strong linear positive relationship, which is significant, exist between the 
Rhodococcal  16S rRNA gene abundance and the maximal rate of CO 2 
production in microcosms (r=0.86; p=0.013; r2=0.65). This implies that 
increase in the abundance of Rhodococcus  in the system resulted in an 
increase in the rate of crude oil mineralisation in microcosms. General, the 
dominance of microbial community in oil degrading systems by Rhodococcus , 
amongst other hydrocarbon degr aders, played a significant role in the 
acceleration of biodegradation process in petroleum degradation in soil 
microcosms.  
4.4.7.3. Correlation of 16S rRNA gene (bacterial and Rhodococcal ) 
relative to Total n -alkanes recovered after the degradation of pet roleum 
hydrocarbon in soil microcosms  
The Pearson’s correlation analysis, as indicated in table 4.6, between total n -
alkanes recovered from microcosms after degradation and bacterial gene 
abundance suggests that there was a negative relationship between th e 
variables (r= -0.53; p= 0.22). The coefficient of determination, r2, indicated 
that very weak linear correlation existed between the variables (r2= 0.0013) 
(see figure 4.24). To explore the possibility non -linearity between total n -
alkanes and bacterial abundance and this revealed that indeed, there is a very 
little correlation is between the variables (r s= -0.39; p=0.38) (see table 4.7). 
Likewise, a similar relationship occurred between total n -alkane and 
Rhodococcal abundance. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient indicated that  123  there is a low negative linear correlation between the variables (see table 4.7 
and figure 4.25), which was not significant (r= 0.58; p= 0.17; r2= 0.33). In 
addition, r s between the variables indicated that the relation is indeed  weak 
(rs= -0.5; p=0.25). The negative correlation coefficients indicate that as total n -
alkane decreases, the general bacterial abundance and Rhodococcal abundance 
increased slightly. The weak relationship observed may be attributed to the 
fact that not a ll carbons of crude oil are converted to biomass. These carbons 
that are not converted to biomass may have been completely mineralized to 
CO2 or converted to other by -products as a result of degradation.

  126  4.5.  Discussions  
The geochemistry and microbiological studies of Ni -oil contaminated soil has 
shown the patterns of Ni effects on the process of petroleum hydrocarbon 
biodegradation and th e associated pattern of change in the community 
diversity and phylogeny. From the studies, Ni at lower concentrations clearly 
stimulated the biodegradation process but the stimulatory effect declines with 
increasing metal concentration. Also, discrepancies  were recorded between 
Ni-forms used with Ni as a Porphyrin complex having the most stimulatory 
effect on biodegradation over the widest concentration range. In addition, the 
inorganic Ni forms, though not statistically different, manifested apparent 
diffe rences between the NiCl 2 and NiO. These differences are manifest at high 
concentrations (200 and 350 ppm) of added Ni with NiO exhibiting stronger 
inhibitory effect at this concentration. In this section, the finding from these 
investigations is related to  previous works in an effort to fully understand the 
unique trend of Ni -effects on the biological process.  
4.5.1. Microbial metabolic activities in oil -amended soil during a short -
term degradation period  
In this project, the trend in CO 2 production over t ime has provided rigorous 
evidence that biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons occurs rapidly 
(within days) in microcosms comprising pristine soils amended with oil. 
Similar trends were observed in previous studies e.g. Obire and Nwaubeta 
(2001) observed  progressive emission of CO 2 in soils amended with 5% 
diesel, gasoline and kerosene, which declined after 4 weeks of incubation. In 
the same vain, Baptista et al (2005) observed a significant progressive trend in 
CO 2 production within 29 days of incubation  during a 45 day crude oil 
degradation experiment and again, (Franco et al. 2014) made a similar 
observation within the first 30 days of a 90 day degradation of diesel in soil 
amended with 5% diesel.  
4.5.2. The influence of Ni on the microbial metabolic a ctivities during oil 
degradation in soils  
Previous studies carried out to determine Ni effect on petroleum hydrocarbon 
and other hydrocarbon degradation in soil has identified that at low 
concentrations, Ni has no effect on degradation at low concentration s of Ni but  127  inhibition by Ni increased with increased NI effect.   For instance, Al -Saleh 
and Obuekwe (2009) studied the effect of Ni (added as NiSO 4) on the 
mineralisation of Crude oil, Hexadecane and Naphthalene in Kuwait soil with 
the aim of identifying  the inhibitory potential of Ni on hydrocarbon 
degradation in Kuwait soils. In their studies, a comparison of Ni –crude oil -
amended soils, crude oil only amended and unamended soils identified no 
significant Ni effect on the soil metabolic activities at th e low concentration of 
20 ppm and at higher concentrations of 100 and 200 ppm in the crude oil and 
Hexadecane contaminated soils. However, in Naphthalene containing soil, 
metabolic activity was reduced significantly. In all the microcosms, an 
increase in i nhibitory effect was observed with increasing concentration of Ni. 
This is comparable with the observations made in NiO contaminated soils 
where Ni at low concentrations of 12.5 25 and 50 ppm has no effect on 
maximum CO 2 produced but inhibitory effects at 200 and 350 ppm Ni. Also in 
this study, NiCl 2 amendment show slight difference with the studies by Al -
Saleh and Obuekwe in that no change in CO 2 production was observed in 
NiCl 2 amended soils. However, an entire contrast was obtained on the 
amendment with Ni-Porph in the current study. Here, amendment with Ni -
Porph stimulated CO 2 production in microcosms and stimulation decreased 
with increased Ni -concentration.  
The observations made in this study may suggest that Ni is performing as an 
essential nutrient i n the soil systems. Majorly, nutrients for oil bioremediation 
usually consider N and P (Atlas 1995; Bragg et al. 1994; Singh et al. 2014; 
Walworth and Reynolds 1995; Walworth et al. 2001; Bell et al. 2011; 
Walworth et al. 2007; Coulon et al. 2005; Sutton e t al. 2014) but rarely 
consider trace element limits. Moreover, there are documentations identifying 
Ni as an essential nutrient required for microbial growth that could become 
toxic at high concentrations (Gadd 2010; Gadd 2004; Gadd and Griffiths 
1977). U sually, in microorganisms, Ni acts as co -factor to certain enzymes, 
which are Ni -dependent (Boer et al. 2014; Thauer et al. 1980; Glass and 
Orphan 2012; Pfaltz et al. 1987; Diekert et al. 1980; Diekert et al. 1981; 
Jeoung et al. 2014; Desguin et al. 2014).  Boer et al (2014) documented 9 
important Ni -dependent enzymes. These included glyoxalase 1 responsible for 
the detoxification of methylglyoxal that occur spontaneously during 
glycolysis, urease which catalysis the conversion of urea to ammonia and  128  carboni c acid, and lactase racemase, which catalyses the racemization of L - 
and D -lactic acids. Others include Superoxide dismutase responsible for the 
detoxification of reactive oxygen species, ROS, such as H 2O2 that are 
produced during respiration due to excess  oxygen; Ni -Fe hydrogenase 
(involves in the reverse activation of molecular hydrogen in anaerobic 
systems) and methyl -coenzyme M reductase (which are involved in anaerobic 
methane oxidation and methanogenesis). Also are the enzyme systems 
involved in the C O2 cycle i.e. carbon -monoxide hydrogenase that catalyses the 
anaerobic oxidation of CO to CO 2 and Acetyl -CoA synthase/decarboxylase 
that is responsible for the anaerobic synthesis of acetyl -CoA from CO 2.  
One way Ni may have stimulated biodegradation is to  instigate the secretion 
of some of these Ni - dependent enzymes for the maintenance and growth of 
microbial cells. One important Ni -dependent enzyme that may have been 
activated in the soils investigated is the superoxide dismutase. Usually, the 
uptakes of  metals by microbes instigate the production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) in cells, which usually impose oxidative stress in microbial 
cells. The secretion of superoxide dismutase will effect the detoxification of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generate d due to the process of autoxidation, a 
process usually experienced under oxic conditions (Nies 2003; Harrison et al. 
2007; Lemire et al. 2013; Gadd 2004). ROS production is usually activated on 
uptake by metals due to the presence of electrons from electr on donors 
(Lemire et al. 2013). However, when the rate of ROS production supercedes 
the elimination rate, oxidative stress occurs. This may explain the inhibitory 
effects observed at a high concentration of Ni added as NiO. Therefore, the 
possibility that the rate of ROS production is minimal at lower Ni 
concentration and higher at high Ni concentration seems to be the case in the 
soil systems investigated.  
Presently, no Ni -dependent enzymes are directly involved in petroleum 
biodegradation under aerobic co nditions that are. In bacteria, most of the 
enzyme systems that have been documented to be involved in hydrocarbon 
degradation are involved in the catabolism of alkanes, which involves the 
initial enzymatic oxidation of terminal or sub -terminal methyl grou p/ groups 
(depending on the microbe) to generate a primary alcohol. This is followed by 
enzymatic oxidation of the primary alcohol to fatty acid, which is  129  subsequently mineralisation by the process of beta -oxidation, which yields 
Acetyl CoA.  The product i s channelled to the Kreb cycl e for energy 
generation and CO 2 generation. These reactions have been studied extensively 
(KESTER and FOSTER 1963; Wang et al. 2010; Funhoff et al. 2007; Van 
Beilen et al. 2006; Das and Chandran 2011a; Nelson 2009; Denisov et a l. 
2005; Van Bogaert et al. 2011; Urlacher and Girhard 2012). One group of 
enzymes are the Cytochrome P450 alkane hydroxylases which constitute 
family of monooxygenases which play an important role in the microbial 
degradation of oil, chlorinated hydrocarb ons, fuel additives, and many other 
compounds (Oldenhuis et al. 1989; De Mot and Parret 2002; Das and 
Chandran 2011b; S. W. Lee et al. 2006). Cyt P450s are more generally 
enzyme systems, which catalyse diverse metabolic reactions in living 
organisms (Urlac her and Girhard 2012; Van Bogaert et al. 2011) and the 
diversity of Cyt P450s is so great that there are 1105 reported bacterial 
systems and 27 archaeal systems (Nelson 2009). Although, Cyt P450s do not 
contain Ni, this metal may have indirectly affected C ytochrome P450 enzyme 
systems in the microcosms because interestingly, peroxides are known to 
induce these enzymes (Zu et al. 1999; D Hamdane, H. M. Zhang, et al. 2008; 
Hamdane et al. 2009; Djemel Hamdane et al. 2008; Hannemann et al. 2007; D 
Hamdane, H. Z hang, et al. 2008) and thus Ni may have indirectly stimulated 
the rates of oil biodegradation through the production of peroxides facilitating 
the secretion of Cyt P450 necessary for the activation of the seemingly inert 
petroleum hydrocarbons (Das and Chandran 2011a).  
Furthermore, in addition to the biological catabolic process of hydrocarbon 
degradation, certain Cyt p450 enzyme systems have been documented to 
catalyse the production of biosurfactants by bacteria and fungi (Van Bogaert et 
al. 2011; Urlach er and Girhard 2012). Hydrocarbon degraders produce 
biosurfactants increase the surface area of hydrophobic water -insoluble 
substrates and increase their bioavailability to degraders (Lawniczak et al. 
2013; Ron and Rosenberg 2002; Sen et al. 2012). The hyd rophobic tail of 
biosurfactants comprise common Fatty Acids (FAs) and Hydroxylated FAs 
originating from beta -Oxidation (Van Bogaert et al. 2011) and the  study of the 
microbial communities of  the microcosms revealed that known biosurfactant 
producers such a s Rhodococcus  (Bicca et al. 1999 ) (Pacheco et al. 2010) and  130  Pseudomonas  (Ben Belgacem et al. 2015; Aparna et al. 2012; Onwosi and 
Odibo 2012) are enriched/ selected.   
More so, some of FAs and Hydroxylated FAs generated during the terminal or 
sub-terminal oxidation of n -alkanes by microbes are used as building blocks of 
cell components e.g the cell membranes (Van Bogaert et al. 2011; Sutcliffe 
1998; Sutcliffe et al. 2010). Hence, in addition to hydrocarbon degradation, Ni 
may have indirectly affected the mi crobial anabolic processes, i. e. biomass 
build -up in microcosms.  
 
4.5.3. Bioavailability of Ni and its effect on the biodegradation of 
petroleum hydrocarbons  
The observations made in this research identified different stimulatory and 
inhibitory effects in fluenced by Ni chemical forms. In the Ni -porphyrin 
containing microcosms, stimulatory effects on degradation were observed 
even at high concentrations whereas inhibitory effects were observed in the 
inorganic forms at high concentrations. One explanation f or these observations 
could be the bioavailability of Ni in the degrading systems. Possibly, Ni in the 
organic form is more accessible than in inorganic forms in these systems. The 
transport of organometallic complexes such as metalloporphyrins is a usual 
strategy by microbes to facilitate uptake of specific metals and to mitigate 
potential toxic effects of metal ions (Harrison et al. 2007; Lemire et al. 2013; 
Vraspir and Butler 2009; Nies 2003). Matlakowska and Sklodowska (2010) 
documented in details the h ighly efficient assimilation of metalloporphyrins 
by indigenous microorganisms of the Kuperferschiefer black Shale from 
Poland, which was subsequently followed by intracellular degradation of the 
porphyrin, freeing the metal ions within the cells. However,  excessive 
intracellular cations may result in oxidative stress resulting to protein 
malfunction. This complements the decline in stimulatory effect with 
increasing concentration observed in Ni -Porph containing soil systems.  
There are apparent differences  between the two inorganic forms of Ni 
investigated. Of the two forms, NiCl 2 seemed to be less inhibitory than NiO, 
an effect that was especially clear at high Ni concentrations. This is surpris ing 
when it is considered that c hlorides of metal salts are re adily soluble in water  131  while oxides are insoluble (Yoder 2006) and are therefore easily dissociated 
into ionic forms thereby contributing to the cationic pool in soil solutions, 
which are the bioavailable/mobile forms of metals ( Gadd 2004; Gadd and 
Griffit hs 1977; Gadd 2010; Bruins et al. 2000; van Gestel and van Diepen 
1997; Olaniran et al. 2013; Roane 2015). An explanation for such an 
observation may be that Ni added in as NiCl 2 may have dissociated readily in 
the soil solution, chelating the readily avai lable organic compounds, which 
either facilitates its uptake by soil microbes or reduce its bioavailability at 
high concentrations of Ni. However, Ni added as NiO dissociated slower and 
due to depletion of organics, due to crude oil degradation, was not re adily 
bound to organic, hence was readily bioavailable at high concentration, as a 
consequence, inhibitory effect occurred.  
 More so, the evidence that certain metal oxides including Ni -oxides can 
mediate the formation of superoxides during the decompositi on of peroxides 
(Kitajima et al. 1978; Anpo et al. 1999 ). Also, NiO nanoparticles are reported 
to induce the production of superoxides in microbes (Horie et al. 2011; Baek 
and An 2011). Therefore, in NiO containing systems, peroxidases may have 
been produc ed at rates that supercede its detoxification resulting to increased 
metal stress.  
4.5.4. Mechanism of Ni Uptake  
In this study, metals may have been transported into the microbial cell through 
microbial transport systems. Generally, the uptake of Ni by mi crobial cells is 
typically through transport systems such as the ABC -transporter -like system, 
which is an ATPase -binding cassette, Nik -ABCDE (Dosanjh and Michel 
2006; Eitinger and Mandrand -Berthelot 2000; Macomber and Hausinger 2011; 
Mulrooney and Hausinge r 2003; Nies 1999). Nik -ABCDE comprised of 5 
proteins; NikA which a is a periplasmic nickel -binding protein, NikB and 
NikC which are integral inner membrane proteins that form transmembrane 
pore for the passage of Ni; and NikD and NikE are membrane -associa ted 
proteins with intrinsic ATPase activity i.e the coupling of energy from ATP 
hydrolyzation (Mulrooney and Hausinger 2003; Dosanjh and Michel 2006; 
Eitinger and Mandrand -Berthelot 2000; Nies 1999). Apart from NikABCDE 
transport system, Ni is transported into a prokaryotic cell through Ni -specific 
permeases such as HoxN transporter initially observed in Ralstonia eutropha,  132  driven by chemiosmotic gradient (Mulrooney and Hausinger 2003). Others 
include HoxN homologues proteins such as NhiF transporter which is specific 
transporter for both Co and Ni initially observed in Rhodococcus rhodochrous 
J1, NixA observed in Helicobacter pyroli (important factor in the organism's 
virulence), NicT in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HupN transporter in 
Bradyrhizobium japo nicum (Mulrooney and Hausinger 2003; Eitinger and 
Mandrand -Berthelot 2000).  
Within the microbial cells, intracellular proteins, which shields and transport 
Ni to the specific active sites required enzyme, have been reported 
(O’Halloran and Culotta 2000)(M ulrooney and Hausinger 2003). These are 
called metallochaperones and they mitigate the toxic effect of metals within 
microbial cell.  
 
4.5.5. Total petroleum hydrocarbon and degradation pattern in degraded 
Ni-Petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil  
In this project, n -Alkanes were determined and quantified and the pattern of 
degradation was observed (see section 4.4.4.3). The observation made in 
microcosms was that the lower molecular weight n -Alkanes (n -C12 - n-C18) 
were degraded prior to the medium (n -C19 - n-C25) molecular weight 
hydrocarbon, which was degraded preferentially to the hig h molecular weight 
n-Alkanes (n -C26 - n-C33). This observation is consistent with the general 
knowledge of aerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons where lower molecular 
weight  hydrocarbons are preferentially degraded prior to the degradation high 
molecular weight hydrocarbons. Increased biodegradability is inhibited with 
increased complexity of hydrocarbons due to the fact that accessibility by 
microbes/attack by enzymes are hindered ( Head et al. 2006). In fact, Peters et 
al. (2007) acknowledged that molecular weight is inversely proportional to the 
degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in an aerobic environment.  Contrary 
to this is the observation made by (Fayad and Overton 19 95) who observed 
that polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were preferentially degraded 
prior to saturates in the Arabian Gulf spills during the gulf war. This, they 
observed could be due to the significant presence of indigenous microbial 
population, w hich have the capability to degrade PAHs. Also, Atlas and  133  Hazen (2011) reported that due to the high composition of saturates and less 
complex compounds in the crude oil spilt during the 2010 BP Deepwater 
horizon blowout, biodegradation was a much  faster t han the 1989 Exxon 
Valdez spill in the united states.  
Previous studies have indicated that the pattern of crude oil degradation in 
aerobic condition differs from anaerobic systems. Under anaerobic conditions, 
more complex hydrocarbons are degraded prior t o the less complex 
hydrocarbons  (Sherry et al. 2013; Aitken et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2008; 
Hasinger et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2014; Gray et al. 2011; Atlas 1981; and 
references therein). For instance, Hasinger et al reported a preferential initial 
degrada tion of branched - alkanes over straight -chained n -alkanes in anaerobic 
system. Also, Hasinger et al observed the preferential degradation of medium 
to higher molecular weight n -alkane over lower molecular weight n -alkane in 
systems composed of nitrates as terminal electron acceptors. They also 
observed that degradation of nC 31 and nC 32 were significant in sulphate 
reducing system. These observations made are  contrary to the pattern of n -
alkane degradation in this project.  
Comparison pattern of degradation a cross treatments (see section 4.4.4.3.) 
indicated that apart from soil microcosms amended with NiO at 350 ppm, the 
pattern of degradation was similar across all treatment. It should be noted that 
results from recovered TPH, nC 17/Pristane ratio and nC 18/ phytane ration 
indicated that little or no degradation occurred on the amendment with NiO at 
350 ppm Ni. Therefore, preferential degradation pattern observed in degraded 
microcosms may be evidence that Ni was indirectly stimulating the secretion 
of hydrocarb on degrading enzymes.  As has been discussed in the previous 
section, the increased assimilation of Ni by microbes could result in the 
production of peroxides and it has been established in the past that peroxides 
induce the Cyt P450 oxygenase enzyme syste m. This enzyme system has been 
known to catalyse the metabolism of short carbon chain n -alkanes ( nC5 –nC16) 
and cycloalkanes in Bacteria (Das and Chandran 2011b).  
4.5.6. Community diversity and phylogeny  
Atlas (1981) documented that the capability to degra de petroleum is not 
restricted to a few but extends to diverse phylogenetic groups.  This wide  134  capability across different organisms seem to be the case with the 
communities studied in this project. As presented earlier, the DGGE analysis 
revealed that the  microbial communities were highly diverse in all soils with 
phylogenetic groups representing both low and high GC content containing 
groups. This evidence of high diversity was buttressed with the alpha -diversity 
assessment from the sequence libraries ( i.e the estimation of specie richness, 
Shannon and Simpsons indices), which indicated slight enrichment in 
petroleum -contaminated soils (with or without Ni, except for NiO containing 
soils at Ni concentration of 350 ppm) differing the soils from uncontaminat ed 
control. High diversity observed in this study is similar to previous studies on 
aerobic biodegradation of petroleum in soils within a short period of 
degradation or the early stage of long -term degradation (LI et al. 2007; Labbé 
et al. 2007; Muangchind a et al. 2014; Abed et al. 2015; dos Santos et al. 2012; 
Joynt et al. 2006a). For instance, a slight decrease in the diversity of the 
community structure within 15 days of laboratory incubation of soil 
contaminated with diesel fuel has been reported in the  past (LI et al. 2007). 
Abed et al. (2015) reported automated  rRNA intergenic spacer (ARISA) 
analysis profiles which indicated highly diverse communities in 5 dessert soils 
contaminated with crude oil with the soil containing  a relatively  higher 
petroleum concentration  harbouring a higher specie /OTU richness.  More so, 
interestingly, high diversity encountered in hydrocarbon -contaminated soils is 
not impaired by the presence of metals. Similar to the observations in this 
project, soi l contaminated with Cr,  Pb and p etroleum hydrocarbon indicated 
phylogenically diverse microbial communities in soil from Indiana, USA and 
Phylogenetic groups included high and low GC gram -positives, α-, β-, γ-
Proteobacteria , green non -sulfur bacteria and others reflecting metal and 
petroleum effects (Joynt et al. 2006a).  In addition to this, dos Santos et al. 
(2012 ) recorded  high diversity in petroleum degrading Brazilian soil 
contaminated with chrom ium and copper.  
Other than the soil environment, high microbial diversity has also been 
recorded in marine, freshwater and estuarine sediments contaminated with 
petroleum under both aerobic and anaerobic systems. Dell’Anno et al. (2012) 
investigated the b ioremediation of habour sediments under oxic and anoxic 
conditions and identified diverse communities under both conditions. 
However, diversity was greater under an oxic than an anoxic condition. In  135  their studies of petroleum degradation, Gray et al 2011 a nd Sherry et al., 2013 
identified a diverse community of bacteria and Archaea in the methanogenic 
and sulfate -reducing system. These studies imply that communities 
encountered in petroleum degrading systems, not withstanding the condition 
are highly divers e.   
The high efficiency of hydrocarbon degradation was attributed to the high 
diversity of communities as opposed to degradation by a consortium 
comprising of selected few microbial group as typically created in the 
laboratory (Dell’Anno et al. 2012). Typ ically an ecological network is created 
in degrading systems whereby members of the community interact, directly or 
indirectly, with each other and with the environment (Head et al 2006). Such 
interactions, which include cooperative relationships, competit ion for nutrient 
and space, predation and lysis by phage, contribute to biodegradation 
efficiency in the natural environment. Of great importance are the mutualistic 
interactions between members of the microbial community. A good example 
is the production of biosurfactants by bacteria (Head et al 2006, and reference 
therein). In their 27 weeks study, Kaplan and Kitts (2004) identified 
successional changes in community diversity during the petroleum 
biodegradation in soils of Guadalupe oil field, central Cal ifornian coast, 
California USA.  Their findings indicated that Pseudomonas  and 
Flavobacterium  were identified as the dominant organisms during the first 3 
weeks of rapid degradation. These phylogenetic groups were succeeded by 
other members of the communit y as their abundances decreased. Also, a 
detailed study of the degradation of Deepwater horizon petroleum in the Gulf 
of Mexico also identified Pseudomonas  within the early stage of degradation 
(Dubinsky et al. 2013). The production of biosurfacta nts by st rains of 
Pseudomonas s p and the improvement on the efficiency of petroleum 
degradation has been well documented in previous studies. (Zhang et al. 2012; 
Thavasi et al. 2011; Saikia et al. 2012).  Also, strains of Flavobacterium 
identified at an early stage  by Kaplan and Kit are known degraders of high 
molecular hydrocarbon in marine (Dubinsky et al. 2013) , degraders  of 
polyaromatics in the marine environment (Gertler et al 2009) and bacterial 
predators (Banning et al., 2010).   136  The importance of Rhodococcus s p. in the degrading communities is indicated 
by correlation analysis with strong positive relationships between the 
Rhodococcus  abundance  and both CO 2 production and rate of CO 2 production. 
Rhodococcus  is known to secret extracellular polysaccharides, whic h reduce 
the surface tension  of hydrophobic media such as oils. In other words, some 
strains of Rhodococcus  produce biosurfactant that act to emulsify oils. The 
production of biosurfactant by Rhodococcus  sp and their role in hydrocarbon 
degradation has bee n well documented (White et al. 2013; Liu and Liu 2011; 
Kumari et al. 2012; Zheng et al. 2012; Sorkhoh et al. 1990; Iwabuchi et al. 
2000; Iwabuchi et al 2002). An example of such role, just like the ones stated 
in the previous paragraph, is the enhanced de gradation of aromatics by the 
Rhodococcus  biosurfactant, which promoted community dominance by 
hydrocarbon degrader, Cycloclasticus  in seawater (Iwabuchi et al 2002).  
Other OTUs identified in this study, as being involved in hydrocarbon 
degradation are clo se relatives of, Bacillales , unknown Comamonadaceae , 
Mycobacterium , Norcadia , Pseudomonas , Methylibium , Rhodoplanes , 
Arthrobacter  and unclassified Rhodobium . These organisms have been 
isolated in petroleum -contaminated  environments and during petroleum 
degradation in heavy metal -petroleum co -contaminated in soils in previous 
studies (Máthé et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2010; Dubinsky et al. 2013; Atlas and 
Hazen 2011b; LI et al. 2007; Mittal and Singh 2009; Labbé et al. 2007).  
The dominance of communities by t he Rhodococcus  OTU in this study may 
be attributed to the metabolic versatility of the organism. Previous studies 
have identified Rhodococcus  species in petroleum hydrocarbon  and metal co -
contaminated systems (Ivshina and Kuyukina 2014; Ivshina et al. 2013 ; Máthé 
et al. 2012). In recent research by Ivshina and Kuyukina (2014) genes 
encoding enzymes that catalyse catabolism of alkanes, biosurfactant 
production and Heavy metal resistance were identified in a strain of 
Rhodococcus s p, Rhodococcus ruber  IEGM 23 1. Some of the genes identified 
included Monooxygenases, Cyt P450, Dioxygenases, peroxidases and 
dehydrogenases involved in the metabolism of hydrocarbons. Others included 
genes the encode Acyl -CoA synthase and Fatty Acid synthase that catalyses 
biosurfact ant production and heavy metal resistant genes including genes for  137  Heavy metal transporters, cation efflux enzymes , metal binding proteins, 
mercuric reductase and alkyl mercury lyase.  
The Real time -qPCR data generated in this study indicated that abundanc e of 
the 16S rRNA gene of the Rhodococcus  OTU across communities differed 
with increasing Ni concentration resulting in decreasing abundance of the 
Rhodococcus .  This corresponds  to maximum CO 2 production, maximal rate of  
C2 production and recovered TPH da ta. Previous studies  have documented  Ni 
toxicity to Actinobacteria  (Ivshina et al. 2013). In their study, Ivshina et al 
identified Ni as the third most toxic metal amongst  8 metals tested, which 
included Cd, Zn, Ni, Cu, Mo, Pb, Cr and V in order of decreas ing toxicity. 
Also, high concentrations of Ni ranging from 130 to  260 mg/Kg decreased 
microbial degradation  of petroleum  by communities dominated by 
Actinobacteria  and α-Proteobacteria  (Taketani et al. 2015). However, Ni 
influence in the enhancement of petroleum  degradation have been identified in  
a previous study where increased degradation of petroleum due to increased 
hydrocarbon degraders as a result of  increased N i concentration (ranging from 
2.5 to 12.5 ppm) was observed during the bioremediation of Gasoline -Nickel 
co-contaminated  soil by phytoremediation (Agarry et al. 2014).  
Conclusions  
The aim of this project was to understand the effect of Ni, in different 
chemical forms and at Ni - concentrations on the biodegradation of petroleum 
hydrocarbon in pristine soils. Using geochemical and microbiological 
approaches, the Ni effects on the Microbial activities, the compositional 
change of petroleum and the microbial co mmunity diversity and phylogeny 
were determined successfully on the same experimental systems.  
In general, the findings suggest that Ni at a lower concentration, have no or 
stimulatory effects on biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soils 
depending on the chemical form of added Ni. The stimulatory effect was 
observed in Ni -porph soils and declined with increasing Ni concentration. 
However, in NiO soils, no effects occurred at low concentrations and 
increased concentration of Ni resulted in increased inhibition of 
biodegradation. This is unlike NiCl 2 amended soils where Ni effects on 
biodegradation were neutral irrespective of Ni concentration. These results are  138  explicable when it is considered that Ni can be linked indirectly to the release 
of metabol ic enzymes, which are important during biodegradation in aerobic 
environment but also may require the Ni to be in complexed (chaperoned) 
form to reduce toxic effects. Therefore, observations made in this study 
suggest that Ni could be a limiting factor dur ing the biodegradation of 
petroleum hydrocarbon in the soil.  
Furthermore, the phylogenetic study detected phylogenetic groups that 
comprised of important petroleum hydrocarbon degraders including 
Rhodococcus , Bacillales,  unknown Comamonadaceae,  Mycobacteri um, 
Norcadia , Pseudomonas , Methylibium , Rhodoplanes , Arthrobacter  and 
unclassified Rhodobium . The most abundant microbe detected was a strain of 
Rhodococcus  spp. Their proliferation in Ni -crude oil co -contaminated  soil was 
linked to their metabolic versati lity, which enables them to degrade while 
utilising Ni as a co -factor at low concentration as well as resisting Ni at high 
concentration. Some of the enzymes systems detected in the genome of 
Rhodococcus  strains included oxygenases, Cyt P450, peroxidases a nd 
dehydrogenases, all these enzymes important during petroleum biodegradation 
in an aerobic environment. Others included enzyme system for metal resistant 
and enzyme systems for biosurfactant production.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  139  Chapter 5  
The effect of Cadmium on the b iodegradation of petroleum 
hydrocarbon in the soil environment  
5.1. Introduction  
Cadmium, with the elemental symbol Cd, is a member of group 12 in the 
periodic table along with zinc and mercury. Its atomic number and mass are 
48 and 112.41 g respectively. The Cd has a density of 8.64 g/cm3 and thus is 
classified as a heavy metal. Cd mainly exists in an oxidation state of +2 and 
the predominant species is Cd2+ (Greenwood and Earnshaw 1997).  
In nature, Cd rarely exists in its elemental form and is found in th e earth crust 
as a co -existing metal in ores of Zn, Pb and Cu. Principally, the mineral forms 
of the metal are greenockite (CdS), Octavite (CdSe) and Monteponite (CdO). 
The Cd has low relative abundance in the earth crust with a concentration 
ranging from 0.08 to 0.1 ppm. Sources of the element in the environment 
include natural activities such as rock weathering and volcano emission as 
well as anthropogenic activities such as mining, agricultural and industrial 
activities. The deposition of Cd in the envir onment due to these activities has 
been widely reported (Hartwig 2013). In fact, the biogeochemistry of the 
metal indicates that the major source of Cd in the environment is through 
human actives (Hartwig, 2013). The metal has also been found to be a 
poten tially toxic substance to human health and the environment. Specifically, 
Cd has been reported to be a potential carcinogen and mutagen based on in -
vitro and in -vivo studies (Huff et al. 2007; Il’yasova and Schwartz 2005; 
Waalkes 2003). In addition, Cd has  been reported to negatively affect 
important microbial activities, terrestrial and aquatic animals as well as plants 
((Sanità Di Toppi and Gabbrielli 1999; Burger 2008; Benavides et al. 2005; 
Barrow 2000; Martelli et al. 2006; Satarug et al. 2003). Due to  its toxicity to 
health and the environment, Cd has been prioritised as heavy metal of concern 
along with Hg and As by the United Nations economic commission for 
Europe (UNECE).  
In the UK, the soil guideline value (Environment Agency 2009) for Cd is 10 
mg/ Kg DW of soil for residential, 1.8 mg/ Kg DW for allotment areas and 
230 mg/ Kg DW for industrial areas. In addition, the Dutch list (ESDAT 2000)  140  recommended intervention values of Cd as 12 mg/ Kg DW in soils and 
sediments.  
The Cd is also one of the metal s commonly found in petroleum, however, its 
concentration depends on the petroleum source, formation and origin. This 
occurrence was discussed in detail in section Chapter 1. Section 1.6. The 
mining of fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal has contribute d to Cd 
environmental contamination. There has been documented pollution of the 
environment due to activities of the petroleum industries all over the world. 
For instance, in the Niger Delta, Nigeria, Cd and other heavy metals have been 
reported to have in creased in the environment by several folds after petroleum 
mining and exploration activities (Osuji and Onojake 2004; Ohimain et al. 
2008; Kadafa 2012; Olawoyin et al. 2012; Osuji and Adesiyan 2005; Adekola 
and Mitchell 2011; UNEP 2011; Benson and Essien 2009; Arias et al. 2010;  
Ite et al. 2013).  Also, reports on increases of Cd and other heavy metals have 
been reported in areas where there are chronic exploration and mining of 
petroleum activities such as Kuwait (Hussain and Gondal 2008; Fields and 
Mass oud 1997; Bou -Olayan et al. 1995). Other reports include the 
bioaccumulation of Cd in aquatic animals after the blowout at the Gulf of 
Mexico, United States (Mendelssohn et al. 2012).  
 Due to its toxicity, the occurrence of Cd above the recommended interve ntion 
values may impair important biological activities such as the biodegradation 
of organic pollutants e. g petroleum. One mechanism of Cd toxicity includes 
the displacement of divalent essential elements in microbial cells resulting in 
cell malfunction.  Based on this premise, this research will investigate the 
effect of Cd on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon in the soil 
environment.  
5.2.    Aims and objective  
The aim of this research is to determine the effect of Cd on hydrocarbon 
degradation in complex natural systems such as a soil using a batch 
microcosm biodegradation study combined with microbial ecological and 
geochemical analysis approaches.  
The objectives were:   141  1.    To determine the effect of different mineral forms of Cd at increasing  
concentrations on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon by 
determining the rates microbial metabolic activities of the soils (CO2 
evolution),  
2.    To determine compositional changes of a whole petroleum during 
biodegradation in the soil contaminate d with different mineral forms of Cd at 
different concentrations using geochemical techniques,  
3.    To determine changes the ecological diversity of microorganisms in soils 
contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon and different forms of Cd at 
increasing co ncentrations during the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon,  
4.    To determine the geochemical associations and fate of the added Cd in a 
hydrocarbon contaminated system.  
5.3.     Methods  
Most of the methods used in this research have been described in detail in 
chapter 2 and include the general details of the molecular microbiological and 
geochemical techniques used. Provided here are brief summaries and specific 
details relevant to the Cd experiments.   
The soil sample used for this project was the loamy -clayey soil from Nafferton 
ecological farm.  The sampling site and soil properties have been described in 
details in sections 2.1.  
Soil Microcosms consisting of Cd in different mineral forms at different 
concentration levels, crude oil and soil were set up in triplicates as described 
in section 2.4. The mineral forms of Cd used were CdCl 2 and CdO. The soil 
amended Cd concentrations were 0.1 ppm, 1.0 ppm, 10 ppm, 100 ppm and 
1000 ppm. The controls employed were soil microcosms amended with either 
crude  oil only and or no amendments. The soil microcosms were incubated at 
room temperature for a period of 16 days. Soil microbial activities were 
monitored per microcosms by measuring the CO 2 production and O 2 
consumption in each microcosm using GC -MS analysi s of the headspace at 2 -
day intervals over the incubation period as described in section 2.5.   142  At the end of the incubation period, soil samples from each microcosm were 
subjected to microbiological studies to ascertain the metal effects on soil 
microbial c ommunity profiles. Culture -independent molecular microbiological 
techniques were used for this purpose (see section 2.8.) Briefly, soil 16S 
rRNA gene was amplified from extracted DNA using the PCR. For microbial 
diversity studies, 16S rRNA gene sequences w ere analysed using PCR -DGGE 
and for a more detailed community diversity study, Ion torrent sequencing – 
PGM was used for the 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Finally, Real time -qPCR 
optimised for the specific quantification of bacteria and the most dominant 
sequence (closely related to strains of Rhodococcus spp.) was used (see 
chapter 3).  
In addition, geochemical studies were carried out to determine the extent and 
pattern of petroleum degradation in microcosms. To this end, petroleum 
hydrocarbon, specifically n-alkanes were determined in soil samples. The 
methods used in this investigation have been described in details in section 2.6. 
Briefly, undegraded petroleum hydrocarbon residues were recovered from soil 
samples using a solvent -solvent extraction method ( see section 2. for details). 
Subsequently, separation of polar and non -polar fractions of extracts was 
carried out using a solid phase extraction technique, which basically involves 
a chromatographic separation of oil components in a chromatographic tube 
comprising non -endcapped octadecyl (C 18) sorbent (Bennett et al. 2007). 
GCFID analysis was used to determine the petroleum hydrocarbons. Peaks of 
n-alkanes were identified, integrated and quantified.  
To understand the chemistry and fate of Cd in the soil, sequestration of Cd in 
soil was carried out using the sequential extraction method as described in 
section 2.7.  
5.4. Results  
5.4.1 . Background concentrations of Cd in Nafferton soil  
The physicochemical analysis of the soil sample used in this experiment 
revealed that the Cd concentration in the soil, which was 0.73 ± 0.09 ppm 
which does not exceed the UK soil guideline or Dutch list value. This signifies 
that the sample was not ‘contaminated’ with Cd. The other heavy metals tested  143  were below the SGV and Dut ch list values of the heavy metals (see table 4.1).  
Also, the soils total organic compound value was 3.1 ± 0.12 %.

Figure 5.1:  the experimental design for the study of crude oil biodegradation in Cd -crude oil 
amended soil microcosms at Cd -concentrat ions of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ppm relative to oil 
only amended (PHC) and no oil amended (soil only) controls in triplicates .  
 
5.4.2 .1 Effect of Cd on soil oil biodegradation microbial activities  
The CO 2 production profiles, the maximum cumulative CO 2 and maximum 
CO 2 production rates in oil only amended soils and unamended soils (i. e soil 
only control) were compared to understand the effect of oil amendment on 
CO 2 production. Also, Cd -crude oil -amended soils were compared relative to  144 the oil only amende d soil control to ascertain the effect of Cd on microbial 
activities in the soil. These profiles were statistically compared using analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) and individual treatments were compared with oil only 
control using the Dunnett’s pairwise compa rison analysis. In addition, 
comparisons were made between treatments using the Fisher’s multiple 
pairwise comparison method.  
5.4.2.2 . The effect of Cd concentrations and chemical forms on CO 2 
production profiles during petroleum degradation  
Cumulative CO 2 in Cd and oil -amended microcosms were determined and 
compared with the oil -amended control to understand the effect of Cd on CO 2 
production during the period of crude oil degradation. Figures 5.3 and 5.4 
show the changes in cumulative CO 2 during the perio d of degradation in 
CdCl 2 and CdO amended soils, respectively. From the figures, it was observed 
that at Cd concentrations of 0.1 and 1 ppm irrespective of Cd form, a similar 
CO 2 production profile was observed relative to oil only amended soil. 
However, C O2 production profiles at 10, 100 and 1000 ppm irrespective of Cd 
form tended towards that observed in the soil only control. Comparison of Cd 
forms using ANOVA indicated that while there were no significant 
differences in CO 2 production between Cd forms ( p=0.47). But comparisons 
of concentrations with ANOVA Indicated that there were differences between 
microcosms at different Cd concentrations (p<0.0001). Dunnett’s pairwise 
comparison analysis indicated that irrespective of form, change in cumulative 
CO 2 during degradation was not significantly different at 0.1 and 1 ppm Cd 
relative to oil only amended soils. However, change in cumulative CO 2 during 
degradation was significantly lower at 10 ppm Cd (p<0.0001), 100 ppm Cd 
(p<0.0001) and 1000 (p<0.0001) ppm Cd  relative to oil only amended soils. 
At these higher concentrations Cd, changes in cumulative CO2 were not 
significantly different relative to soil only control.  
5.4.2.3 Effect of Cd on the maximum cumulative CO 2 during degradation  
Differences in the maxi mum cumulative CO 2 for treatments (as measured after 
16 days) were compared relative to oil only amended soil control. ANOVA 
revealed that there were significant differences in cumulative CO 2 across  145  treatments (p<0.0001). Figure 5.5 shows the Dunnett’s com parison analysis of 
mean maximum cumulative CO 2 of treatments relative to the oil only control.

and graph le gend indicates the added Ni concentration in ppm and the controls. The dotted 
arrow indicates the maximum CO 2 produced in control microcosm amended with crude oil, 
only.   146   
The analysis revealed that relative to oil only control , no significant 
differences i n mean cumulative CO 2 at Cd concentrations of 0.1 and 1 ppm 
occurred irrespective of Cd form. In the CdCl 2 amended soil, the differences 
in means relative to oil only control were 0.06 ± 0.031 mmol g -1 dry soil at 
0.1 ppm Cd (p=0.33) and 0.03 ± 0.031 mmol g-1 dry soil at 1 ppm Cd 
(p=0.97). Similarly, in CdO amended soils, the differences in means of 
maximum cumulative CO 2 relative to the oil only control were 0.08 ± 0.031 
mmol g -1 dry soil at 0.1 ppm Cd (p=0.13) and 0.09 ± 0.031 mmol g -1 dry soil 
at 1 ppm C d (p=0.07) However, the mean maximum cumulative CO 2 at 10, 
100 and 1000 ppm Cd irrespective of Cd form were significantly lower than at 
of oil only amended soils. For CdCl 2 amended soils, maximum cumulative 
CO 2 was lower by 0.41 ± 0.031 mmol g -1 dry soil a t 10 ppm Cd (p<0.0001), 
0.51 ± 0.031 mmol g -1 dry soil at 100 ppm Cd (p<0.0001) and 0.54 ± 0.031 
mmol g -1 dry soil at 1000 ppm Cd (p<0.0001). Similarly, in CdO amended 
soils, maximum cumulative CO 2 was lower by 0.39 ± 0.031 mmol g -1 dry soil 
at 10 ppm Cd ( p<0.0001), 0.55 ± 0.031 mmol g -1 dry soil at 100 ppm Cd 
(p<0.0001) and 0.55 ± 0.031 mmol g -1 dry soil at 1000 ppm Cd (p<0.0001). 
Looking at the profiles there is definitely a progressive impact of these metals 
as concentration increases.  
5.4.2 .4. Effect of  Cd on the maximal rate of CO 2 production during the 
degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon  
The maximal rate of CO 2 production in microcosms during the degradation 
period was achieved between day 5 and day 12. The maximal rate determined 
in microcosms was co mpared with the oil only amended soil control.  Figure 
5.6 compares the maximal rate of CO 2 production in treatment microcosms 
relative to oil only amended soil control and soil only control. From the figure, 
it can be seen that amendment with Cd reduced t he rate of CO 2 production 
resulting in the inhibition of petroleum mineralisation. ANOVA indicated that 
this reduction in maximal rates was significant across all treatments (p<0.0001) 
and influenced significantly Cd concentrations (p<0.0001) irrespective of the 
form of Cd.  
The maximal rates of treatments were compared with the oil only control 
using the Dunnett’s pairwise analysis to determine the effect the Cd on the rate  147  of petroleum mineralization in soils (see figures 5.7 and 5.8). Analysis 
revealed th at in irrespective of Cd -form, the maximal rates at 0.1 and 1 ppm 
were not significantly different from the oil only amended soil. The maximal 
rate of CO 2 production in oil only amended soil was 0.07 ± 0.006 mmols g -1 
dry soil day. In CdCl 2 amended soils, maximal rate was lower by 0.011 ± 
0.005 mmols g -1 dry soil day at 0.1ppm cd (p=0.127) and 0.014  ± 0.005 
mmols g -1 dry soil day at 1 ppm Cd (p=0.056) relative to oil only control. 
Similarly, in CdO amended soils, maximum rate is lower by 0.02 ± 0.008 
mmols  g-1 dry soil day at 0.1 ppm Cd (p=0.08) and 0.018 ± 0.008 mmols g -1 
dry soil day at 1.0 ppm (p=0.11).  
 
 
Figure 5.4 : Comparative analysis (Dunnets’s multiple comparison) of cumulative CO 2 values 
measured after 16 days in CdCl 2 and CdO amended oil degraded  soil microcosms at Cd 
concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 1nd 1000 ppm relative to oil only amended control. The plot 
indicates confidence intervals for the range differences ( 95% confidence) between the 
individual treatment means and the control mean. A me an is not considered significantly 
differen t if the interval spans zero ( 0) 
 
In contrast, maximal rates at higher concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 ppm 
Cd, irrespective of Cd form, were significantly lower relative to the maximal 
rate of oil only control.  In CdCl 2 amended soils, maximal rates were lower by 
0.055 ± 0.005 mmol g -1 dry soil day, 0.061 ± 0.005 mmol g -1 dry soil day and  148  0.068  ± 0.005 mmol g -1 dry soil day at 10, 100 and 1000 ppm Cd, 
respectively, relative to oil only amended control (p<0.0001 a t all 
concentrations). Similarly, in CdO amended soil, maximal rates were lower by 
0.052 ± 0.008 mmol g -1 dry soil day, 0.068 ± 0.008 mmol g -1 dry soil day and 
0.070 ± 0.008 mmol g -1 dry soil day at 10, 100 and 1000 ppm Cd, 
respectively, relative to oil on ly amended control (p<0.0001 at all 
concentrations).  
These observations indicate that at low concentrations of Cd, Cd did not 
significantly affect the rate of petroleum mineralisation although it should be 
noted that the oil only soils gave the highest mi neralisation rates and the 
differences between this rate and the 0.1 and 1 pp m Cd addition experiments 
were borderline significant (P ≤0.1). This is contrary to high Cd 
concentrations, which were clearly inhibitory to CO 2 production.   
To understand the degree of inhibition by Cd, treatment microcosms at high 
concentrations were al so compared with soil only amended soils. The mean 
maximal rates of CO 2 production in soil only control is 0.027 mmol g -1 dry 
soil day. Dunnett’s pairwise comparison (see figure 5.9) indicated that rates 
were not significantly different at 10 ppm irrespect ive of Cd form, relative to 
soil only control. However, at higher concentrations of 100 and 1000 ppm, the 
maximal rates were significantly lower. In CdCl 2 amended soil, maximal rates 
were lower by 0.018 ± 0.005 mmol g -1 dry soil day at 10 ppm (p=0.01) and 
0.025 ± 0.005 mmol g -1 dry soil day at 1000 ppm (p=0.001). Similarly, in 
CdO amended soils, the maximal rate was lower by 0.025 ± 0.005 mmol g -1 
dry soil day at 100 ppm Cd (p=0.0009) and 0.027 ± 0.005 mmol g -1 dry soil 
day at 1000 ppm Cd (p=0.0004).  These  differences observed in the maximal 
rates at 100 and 1000 ppm relative to soil only control suggests that Cd 
inhibited the normal soil microbial activities implying that general soil 
microbes were negatively affected as a re sult of Cd amendment at 100 and  
1000  ppm.   149

  151  5.4.3 . The fate and chemical association of Cd amendments after addition 
to the soil microcosms    
Fractions of added Cd were sequentially partitioned (see section 2.7) to 
understand the chemical associations of the metal in soils.  The a im was to 
provide details of the fate of added Cd in soils.  Here, Triplicate soil samples 
were amended with CdO and CdCl 2 at 10 ppm Cd concentration and were 
incubated at room temperature (21 oC) for 1 week. At the end of the 
incubation period, added Cd w as sequentially extracted from the soils using 
the sequential extraction method for the extraction of metals in soils and 
sediments developed by Tessier et al (1979). The Cd was partitioned based on 
their association with soil fractions, which included the  exchangeable, the 
carbonates, oxides of Fe and Me, Organics and residual fractions.  
Figure 5.10 shows the results of Cd sequential sequestration in the soil. From 
the figure, there are apparent differences in the partitioning between the 
different forms o f Cd investigated. In CdCl2 amended soil 2.64 ppm Cd (26% 
of added Cd), 0.36 ppm Cd (3.6% of added Cd), 1.75 ppm Cd (17.5% of 
added Cd), 1.22 ppm Cd (12.2% of added Cd) and 4.02 ppm Cd (40.2% of 
added Cd) were associated with the soil exchangeable fraction , the carbonates, 
oxides of Fe and Me, Organics and residual fractions, respectively. For CdO, 
1.17 ppm Cd (11.7% of added Cd), 0.71 ppm Cd (7.1% of added Cd), 2.61 
ppm Cd (26.1% of added Cd), 2.92 ppm Cd (29.2 % of added Cd) and 2.59 
ppm Cd (25.9% of adde d Cd) were associated with the soil exchangeable 
fraction, the carbonates, oxides of Fe and Me, Organics and residual fraction, 
respectively. This indicates that exchangeable fractions of the soil (Cd ions 
easily released into soil solution) and residuals were larger fractions in CdCl2 
amended soil than in CdO soils. Whereas Cd associated with carbonates, Fe 
and Mn and organics were larger fractions in the CdO amended soils. Despite 
these apparent differences, ANOVA indicated that there were no significant 
differences in Cd partitioning between CdCl 2 and CdO amended soils 
(p=0.19).  Also, ANOVA indicated that the concentrations of Cd partitioned 
across soil fractions were not significantly different in CdCl 2 (p=0.31) and 
CdO (p=0.50) amended soils.

study. Each bar represent the mean of concentration of Cd associated with the soil fractions in 
triplicate. The error bars represent the standard error of triplicate microcosms.   
 
5.4.4 . Degradation of n -alkanes in soil microcosms ; total n-alknanes 
recovered from Cd -crude oil degraded soil  
The residual petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil microcosms contaminated 
with CdCl 2 and CdO at 0.1, 10 and 1000 ppm Cd were extracted after the 
degradation period and were analysed by GCFID. Total n -alkane (nC 12-nC32) 
determined in the extracts from microcosms were compared with the n -
alkanes (nC 12-nC32) contents of the undeg raded crude oil (see figure 5.10 ). 
ANOVA indicated that there was a significant difference across the treatment 
microcosms (p=0.00 04). The mean total n -alkanes  of the undegraded crude oil 
was 9626.84 ± 451.59 µg. A pairwise comparison of treatment microcosms 
relative to undegraded crude oil using the Dunnett’s method indicated that n-
alkanes  recovered from oil only amended soil was s ignificantly lower relative  153  to the undegraded crude oil by 1398.36 ± 459.17 µg  (p=0.0007), signifying 
that degradation of crude oil occurred in soil microcosms amended with oil.  
However, in Cd -oil amended microcosms, the mean total n -alkanes  were not 
significantly different relative to undegraded crude oil, irrespective of Cd form 
or concentration (p>0.05). This implies that amendment with Cd may have 
deterred the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. This is also manifested in 
the n -alkane profile as se en in the figure 5.12 were n -alkane profiles of Cd -
amended soils appear similar to the n -alkane profile undegraded crude oil.

 5.4.5. Microbiological diversity and phylogeny  
Molecular methods were used to study the microbial community diversity and 
phylogeny in microcosms to understand t he effect of Cd on degraded soil 
communities. These included DGGE and ion torrent sequencing analysis. 
These methods were described in chapter 2 and results are presented in this 
section. Based on the results of the degradation experiment, soil microcosms 
amended with Cd at 0.1, 10 and 1000 ppm were used for these microbiological 
studies.  
 
5.4.5.1. The effect of Cd concentration on microcosm bacterial 
communities identified by endpoint PCR of 16S rRNA genes.  
Polymerase Chain reaction, PCR, was used to ampl ify 16S rRNA genes from 
DNA extracts of soil microcosms and the resultant amplicons were visualised 
by agarose gel electr ophoresis (AGE) (see figure 5.12 a). AGE indicated 
amplification of 16S rRNA gene in soils amended with Cd at 0.1 and 10 ppm 
Cd irrespec tive of Cd forms. However, at 1000 ppm Cd, amplification of 16S 
rRNA was not visualised on the gel. To eliminate the possibility of non -
amplification of 16S rRNA gene at 1000 ppm Cd being due to other factors 
such as inhibition of amplification as a functi on of high metal concentration, a 
control consisting of degraded soil samples amended with Cd at 1000 ppm and 
inoculated with E. coli cells were amplified alongside the treatment samples 
for 1000 ppm Cd. AGE indicated the amplification of E. coli  16S rRNA genes 
at 1000 ppm, but no amplification of soil bacterial 16S rRNA in the treat ment 
microcosms (see figure 5.12  b). This indicated that there was likely an 
inhibition of bacterial growth in soils amended with Cd at 1000 ppm Cd, 
irrespective of Cd -form. Thi s may have explained the significant reduction in 
maximum cumulative CO 2 and the rate of CO 2 production in microcosms, 
relative to soil only microcosms.

communities enrichment influenced by Cd -amendment and the 
reproducibility of communities  
Based on the PCR -AGE analysis, Denaturing gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was 
carried out using amplifie d 16S rRNA genes from CdCl 2 and CdO treated soil 
microcosms at 0.1 and 10 ppm Cd. A visual analysis of the DGGE fingerprints 
of amplified bacterial 16s rRNA gene fragments from soil DNA extracts 
(figure 5 .13) revealed diverse bands amplified from all the s oils analysed 
indicating the presence of a broad range of bacterial species including those 
with low GC -content and those with high GC -content. A high degree of 
reproducibility between experimental replicates was also indicated in the 
DGGE fingerprint allo wing clear identification of treatment -related effects on 
community diversity. Comparisons of the unamended soil control with 
contaminated soils showed selective enrichment of some species of microbes 
in contaminated soils determined based on the intensity  of bands. Cd -presence 
and metal effects dependent on the chemical form of added Cd and 
concentration influenced the enrichment of species in soils. While some bands, 
which were reproducibly present in the oil only microcosm do not seem so 
enriched in the Cd treatments there was also some enrichments of bands in Cd 
treatments, which were less dominant in the oil only. These observations 
provide evidence of the impact of metal toxicity on the diversity of the HC 
degraders enriched and evidence that Cd -effect s the enrichment of selected 
species growth.     
In addition to the visual evidence of treatment reproducibility and distinct 
treatment effects on enriched organisms a numerical analysis of these banding 
profiles identified differences in community structu re using multidimensional 
scaling (MDS) plotted with Bray -Curtis similarity matrix overlaid with 
similarity contours generated from a clustering analysis. This analysis 
revealed that all the communities analysed (including the un -amended soil 
control) clus tered within  40% similarity (see figure 5.14 ). Clustering of 
communities was based on Cd -form where essentially, CdCl 2 amended 
communities, irrespective of concentration, showed 80% similarity. However, 
CdO soils were essentially clustered at 60% similarit y based on the Cd 
concentration. Also, CdCl 2 treated soils clustered with soils amended oil only  158  (oil only) and soil only control within 60% similarity. But essentially, 
reproducibility of communities was indicated at 80% similarity for CdCl 2 
treated soil and controls and 60% similarity for CdO treated soils.

from cluster analyses are superimposed on to the MDS plots. The legend indicates the 
concentrations of added Cd and the controls (i. e. oil only and soil only) as well as similarity

To statistically determine the influence o f Cd form and concentration on 
community fingerprinting, Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) was carried out. 
ANOSIM revealed that with a global r of 0.53 the influence of Cd forms on 
community variation was moderate but highly significantly (p=0.001).  A 
pairwise comparison of treatment forms relative to oil only amended soils 
indicated that there was a very little disparity between CdCl 2 containing 
communities and oil only amended control, which was not significant (Global 
R=0.083; p=0.345). However, signific ant dissimilarity was identified on the  160  comparison of oil only control with CdO (Global R=0.75; p=0. 012). Likewise, 
comparison of treatment concentrations analysed implicated that there was 
very little separation between concentrations of Cd (Global R=0.2 28; 
p=0.033).  
 
5.4.5.3. Qualitative analysis of sequencing data set used for the 
biodiversity study of microbial communities of Cd amended crude oil 
degraded soil  
For a more detailed understanding of soil microbial community diversity of 
experimental micro cosm treatments soils, studies based on the sequencing of 
amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments were carried out. For this purpose, 16Sr 
RNA genes of communities were sequenced using an ion torrent PGM 
sequencing approach. The sequence data obtained were analy sed using the 
mothur software to trim sequence data, cluster sequence data into OTUs, 
assign taxonomic groups to OTUs and analyse community diversity (alpha - 
and beta - diversity of communities) to identify the differences in the microbial 
community structu res. Due to the high reproducibility of communities 
identified from the DGGE analysis, single representative samples for each 
treatment were used in this analysis. Tagged 16S rRNA samples from 17 soil 
samples consisting of metal (Ni, Cd and Pb) petroleum d egraded soils and 
controls, which were the petroleum amended, and unamended soils made up 
the clone library used for the ion torrent sequencing. Communities of the Cd 
amended soils consisted of representative samples including CdCl 2 amended 
soils at 0.1 pp m Cd concentrations and CdO amended soils at 0.1 ppm Cd 
concentrations.  
The ion torrent sequencing recovered a high throughput sequence data set of 
492574 sequences. Sequence data from Cd -amended communities accounted 
for 45789 sequences, i. e. approximate ly 9.30% of the sequence data from the 
clone library (consisting of tagged 16S rRNA sequences from 17 samples). 
Sequence data were trimmed to recover sequences that have a minimum 
length of 300 bp, a maximum of 500 bp. and homopolymers lower than 7 bp 
were  trimmed. This resulted in the omission of ~8.16% of the raw sequence 
data from the Cd amended communities, reducing the sequence recovery to a 
total of 42054 Sequences. Before the trimming, the number of sequences 
recovered in CdCl 2 amended soil was 16646  sequences and 29143 sequences  161  in CdO soils. After trimming, the number of sequences recovered amended 
soils was 14627 sequences from CdCl2 and 27427 sequences from CdO 
amended soils.  
For further analysis on mothur software, sequences were normalised to 80 00 
sequences per sample (the highest number of sequences mothur could analyse 
without crashing). Also, for QIIME analysis, sequences were normalised to 
13500 sequences per sample; reasonably the least sequence count obtained 
considering all 17 samples anal ysed. Table 5.1 shows the Chao estimator on 
the number of observed OTUs per sample after sequence sampling of 13500 
sequences per treatment on QIIME and 8000 sequences per treatment on 
mothur platforms.

5.4.5.4. OTU -base studies on th e influence of Cd on the community 
diversity of oil degraded soil microcosms  
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) generated using the average Neighbor 
clustering method based on 97% similarity cutoff of 8000 16S rRNA 
sequences were analysed to determine the alpha diversity of communities. 
Species richness, Shannon Evenness (E H’), and Simpson’s diversity (λ) were 
estimated using the Mothur (Schloss et al. 2009) platform (table 5.2). These 
estimators of diversity evaluated established microbial species diversity in 
communities and the degree of dominance of communities by species in crude 
oil containing microcosms with or without Cd.  
The species richness was established by determining the number of observed 
OTUs in communities. As has been pointed earlier in chapter 4, 16382 OTUs 
were observed in the whole library analysed. The ob servered  species in oil 
only amended and unamended soil communities were 1676 and 2457 OTUs, 
respectively. Hence, relative to the unamended soil, 31.79% dominance of 
microbial community by hydrocarbon degraders occurred in the oil -amended 
soil. Interesting ly, 2103 and 1910 OTUs were observed in CdCl 2 and CdO 
amended soils respectively. This implies that relative to oil only control, while 
CdCl2 amendment resulted in a decrease in community dominance by  163  17.38%, the dominance by community species increased by  9.52% as a result 
of amendment with CdO and oil.  
Furthermore, the evenness of community species was determined by 
estimating the EH’ of communities.  The EH’ values of communities are 
usually between 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect community species 
unevenness  (i. e. a perfect dominance by a single species) and 1 a perfect 
community species evenness (a perfect heterogeneous community). The EH’ 
of oil -amended soil and unamended soil controls are 0.710628 and 0.874792, 
respectively. To clearly establish the effect of Cd on community spec ies 
evenness, EH’ in Cd amended soils were compared with the oil only amended 
soil control. The EH’ of CdCl2 and CdO amended soils were 0.840788 and 
0.701226, respectively. Furthermore, λ determined in communities clearly 
identified the extent of dominance  in communities by considering species 
richness and evenness. The values of λ are between 0 and 1 with 0 
representing the perfect heterogeneous community and 1 representing the 
perfect homogenous community. λ in oil only amended soil and soil only 
controls  were 0.051148 and 0.003842 respectively. These values of diversity 
indices indicate that the amendment of soil with oil resulted in the most 
homogenous community. This could be attributed to the selective enrichment 
of hydrocarbon degraders in the communi ty. Comparisons of λ in CdCl 2 
amended soil communities relative to oil only amended control indicated that 
with the λ values of 0.008142, homogeneity of the CdCl 2 community 
decreased by 84.01% on the amendment with CdCl 2 relative to the oil only 
control. O n the contrary, homogeneity of CdO amended oil degraded soil 
community increased slightly by 9.52% relative to oil only control. A possible 
explanation for these observations may be that Cd inhibited specific 
enrichment of hydrocarbon degraders in the Cd a mended communities and 
promoted highly specific enrichment of Cd -resistant species, especially in 
CdO soils.  
In other to distinguish between diversities of control and treatment 
communities, Yue and Clayton’s dissimilarity coefficient, θ (see table 5.3) 
was evaluated for all treatments relative to oil only amended and unamended 
controls. The value of θ ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 denoting a perfect similarity 
between communities and 1 a perfect dissimilarity between communities. The  164  values  of θ indicated that community diversity of CdO (θ=0.6326) and CdCl2 
(θ=0.1.218) amended soils were dissimilar to oil only amended soil 
community with CdO having a greater dissimilar diversity. Similarly, relative 
to soil only control, with θ values of 0.9 650 and 0.5782 in CdCl 2 and CdO 
amended soils respectively, there are dissimilarities between community 
diversity of Cd amended soils and unamended soils.

5.4.5. 5. Community diversity study; Cd effects on the diversity of 
hydrocarbon degraders in oil degraded soil microcosms based on 
phylogenetic analysis  
The number of OTUs that consisted of ~50% relative abundance of microbes 
in communities was determined to unde rstand the pattern of dominance in 
communities. The evaluation identified discrepancies between Cd forms. 
From the evaluation, 27 OTUs made up 50% relative abundance in CdCl2 
amended community. This is comparable to oil only amended control, which 
has 22 O TUs consisting of 50% relative abundance. On the contrary, 111 
OTUs made up 50% relative abundance in CdO contaminated communities 
indicating inhibition of dominance relative to oil only amended control. In  165  addition, 171 OTUs consist of 50% of the relative  abundance of bacteria in 
soil only control.  
5.4.5.6. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of microbial communities of 
Cd-Crude oil -amended soils relative to oil only amended soils and 
unamended soils  
Classification of OTUs carried out using a Bayesian method  (Wang, George 
M Garrity, et al. 2007) and by matching sequences against the Silva, RDP and 
green genes reference files on MOTHUR and QIIME platform revealed that 
the most abundant organisms growing in all petroleum contaminated 
communities (with or withou t Cd) included species of the bacteria and archaea. 
The bacterial and archaeal species that predominated (representing ~50% of 
microbial abundance per community) belong to members of 10 phyla 
Actinobacteria , Proteobacteria , Bacteroidetes , Acidobacteria , Chloroflexi , 
Firmicutes , Planctomycetes , Gemmatimonadetes , Verrucomicrobia  and 
Crenarchaeota  in the order od decreasing abundance (see figure 5.1 5). Further 
classification to genus level identified the most enriched OTUs in all 
petroleum contaminated soil sy stems (with or without Cd) were closely related 
to the species of Rhodococcus , Mycobacterium , unclassified 
Comamonadaceae , Nocardia , Pseudomonas , Achromobacter , Sphingobium , 
Bacillales , Acidobacteria , Parvibaculum  and Tsukamurella  in order of 
decreasing do minance (see figure 5.16 ).  
Considering the most abundant OTU (OTU1), which was closely related to 
Rhodococcus  sp., analysis on QIIME platform revealed with the relative 
abundance of 19.90%, Rhodococcus  in oil only amended soil control was 
enriched up to 1 58 times more than unamended soil control in which it was 
present at 0.13% relative abundance. However, the relative abundances of it in 
the CdO soil was 8.46%, which was 11.44 %, lower relative to the oil only 
control. On the contrary, the relative abunda nce of Rhodococcus  in the CdCl 2 
amended soil community was 23.32% and this was 3.43% higher relative to 
oil only control. This explains the differences in diversities from the previous 
section where diversity in CdO amended soil were significantly differen t  166  relative to oil only control at 0.1 ppm cd whereas CdCl 2 amended soils 
showed similarity in diversity relative to oil only control at 0.1 ppm Cd.  
The OTU1 sequence identified in Cd amended soils was the same as that 
obtained from the soil amended with Ni  and oil (see chapter 4). As has been 
pointed out in chapter 4, the closest related strains of Rhodococcus  to OTU1 
were identified using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) and RDP 
sequence Match. This analysis revealed that OTU1 was very closely  related to 
strains isolated from hydrocarbon -contaminated and metal contaminated 
environments (see table 4.6). Some these close relatives that showed 100% 
similarity to OTU1 were R. erythropolis   (AJ576250) from Antarctica soil 
(Shivaji et al. 2004) , R. erythropolis  DN1 (X79289) from Khazastan soil 
polluted with crude oil (Shevtsov et al. 2013), and Rhodococcus sp.  YE1 
(EU293153) crude oil contaminated soil (Cao 2007). Others include 
Rhodococcus sp.  Pi71 (AM110074) from benzene -contaminated groundwater 
(Fahy et al. 2006), Rhodococcus sp. SQ8  (DQ366088) from oil polluted soil 
(Nohit et al. 2006), and R . qingshengii  djl-6 (DQ90961) from carbendazim 
contaminated soil (Jing -Liang et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2007) R. jialingiae  strain 
djl-6-2 (DQ185597) from carbend azim contaminated sludge. Rhodococcus sp.  
Q15 (99.7 %) psychrophilic bacteria from Bay of Quinte, Ontario (Whyte et al. 
1998) and an uncultured bacterium (DQ125599) (99%) from uranium -
contaminated soil (Brodie et al. 2006). Others included a bromate -reduci ng 
bacterium B8 (AF442524) (99%) from drinking water (Davidson et al. 2011) 
and R. koreensis (AM497794) (97.5%) from a German forest soil (Makdessi 
et al. 2007; Becker et al. 1997).  
Furthermore, phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were 
conduct ed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA 6) 
software. The sequences of closely and more distantly related strains identified 
in the BLAST analysis including Rhodococcus  type sequences were aligned 
with the OTU1 sequence identified in this  study and an evolutionary tree using 
the Neighbor -joining method was constructed (see figure 4.19).   
  167  5.4.5.7. Evidence of Cd -influence on selective enrichment of hydrocarbon 
degraders in soil  
The phylogenetic analysis of communities indicated that speci es of 
hydrocarbon degraders being enriched in communities are influenced by Cd -
mineral form and presence. First of all, as has been indicated earlier in a 
previous section, although Rhodococcus  was the primary hydrocarbon 
degrader enriched in communities, the relative abundances of Rhodococcus  in 
communities varied.  In addition to this, evidence of Cd influence on the 
enrichment of other organisms in the communities was clear. For instance, the 
relative abundances of Mycobacterium  (OTU 4) in the oil only a mended soil 
community was 8.47% whereas the relative abundance of Mycobacterium sp.  
in CdO and CdCl 2 amended soil communities was 1.56% and 1.41%, 
respectively. Similarly, enrichment of Nocardia sp . (OTU 7) was observed to 
be more in oil only amended soil community than the Cd -contaminated soil 
communities. The relative abundance of Nocardia sp.  in oil only amended soil 
community (3.50%) was ~ 3X more than that of CdO -amended soil (1.12%) 
and ~ 1.4X more in CdCl 2 amended soil communities (2.48%).  
Furthermo re, differences in Cd influence on enrichment could be observed 
from relative abundances of Pseudomonas sp . (OTU 3) in microcosms. As 
was mentioned earlier, Pseudomonas  was on of the enriched hydrocarbons in 
soils. Analysis revealed that Pseudomonas  abunda nce in soil only control was 
0.1%. This increased on an amendment with crude oil to 2.86%. In Cd -crude 
oil-amended soils, Pseudomonas  was observed to more enrich  in CdCl 2-
amended soil (relative abundance = 5.9%) than in CdO amended soil (relative 
abundance  = 2.27%). These observations made on the enrichment of 
Rhodococcus , Mycobacterium , Nocardia  and Pseudomonas  suggested that 
selective enrichment of hydrocarbon degraders in communities was dependent 
on Cd presence. Also, Cd form may have influenced species  enrichment in 
communities.

  170  5.4.6. Absolute 16S rRNA gene abundances of g eneral bacteria and 
Rhodococcus in the microbial communities of Cd -crude oil -amended 
degraded soil microcosms  
So far, the most dominant taxonomic group in oil -contaminated microcosms 
are the strains of the genus Rhodococcus. In addition, the relative abund ances 
in representative microcosms were presented in previous section. The 
phylogenetic analysis identified the influence of Cd amendment on species 
richness. To provide a clear understanding of the Cd influence on species 
abundances in communities, qPCR a ssays specifically carried out to target  16S 
rRNA genes of Bacteria and Rhodococcus  determined the absolute abundance 
of targeted 16S rRNA genes in the communities. To understand the effect of 
crude oil amendment on 16S rRNA gene abundance, the community o f soil 
amended with oil only was compared to soil only control. Furthermore, the 
abundances of the 16S rRNA genes of treatment soils were compared to the 
controls to determine the absolute influence of Cd on 16S rRNA gene 
abundances in communities.  
5.4.6.1 . Influence of crude oil amendment of soil on the abundance of 
bacteria and Rhodococcus   
qPCR analysis (see figure 5.17 ) identified that while the mean 16S rRNA gene 
copies in unamended soil communities were 5.30 X 107 ±  9.86 X 106   
sequences, the mean t he mean number of 16S rRNA gene copies in the oil 
only amended soil  communities was 4.10 X 107 ±  1.39 X 106 gene copies. 
Comparison of mean 16S rRNA gene copies in the communities identified that 
there was no significant difference between the sizes of t he bacterial gene 
abundances (p=0.518).   
However, the amendment of soil with crude oil increased the abundance of 
Rhodococcus  in soil communities. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene abundance 
of Rhodococcus  (see figure 5.17 ) in oil only amended soil control (1 .25 X 107 
± 4.13 X 106) relative to the unamended soil (6.57 X 105 ± 2.37 X 104) 
revealed that there was a significant increase in the abundance of Rhodococcus  
in the oil -amended soils (p=0.008). Hence, mean Rhodococcus  16S rRNA 
gene abundance in the oil o nly amended soil was significantly higher than the  171  mean Rhodococcus  16S rRNA gene abundance in soil only controls by 1.18 X 
10 7 ± 2.39 X 10 6 sequences.  
5.4.6.2. Influence of Cd amendment on the abundance of bacteria and 
Rhodococcus in crude oil degrading  soil 
The determination of bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance by qPCR assay 
revealed that the amendment of Cd affected the abundance of bacteria in the 
microb ial communities (see figure 5.17 ). ANOVA indicated that there is a 
significant difference across tr eatments (p=0.013). To determine the influence 
of Cd and oil combinations on soil bacterial communities, pairwise 
comparison of treatments relative to oil only amended soil communities were 
carried out and this analysis indicated that the mean bacterial 16 S rRNA gene 
abundance at 0.1 and 10 ppm Cd were not significantly different relative to oil 
only control, irrespective the form of Cd. However, mean bacterial 16S rRNA 
was significantly lower relative to oil only amended control in communities 
contaminated  with CdCl 2 (p=0.043) and CdO (p=0.05) at 1000 ppm by 4.09 X 
107 ± 1.39 X 107 and 3.77 X 107 ± 1.39 X 107, respectively.  
Furthermore, the influence of Cd -oil amendment on the abundance of 
Rhodococcus was determined by comparing the Rhodococcus  16S rRNA ge ne 
abundances  of communities (see figure 5.17 ). ANOVA indicated that the 
Rhodococcus 16S rRNA gene abundance was significantly different across 
communities (p<0.0001). Comparative analysis by Dunnett’s pairwise tests 
(see figure 5.19) revealed that relativ e to the oil only amended soil 
community, the mean 16S rRNA gene abundance of Rhodococcus  was not 
significantly different to the CdO 0.1 ppm amended soil community. The 
mean 16S rRNA gene abundances were 1.47 X 10 7 ± 2.09 X 10 6 and this was 
slightly high er relative to oil only control by 2.19 X 10 6 (p= 0.93). However, 
the mean 16S rRNA gene abundance was significantly lower in the other Cd 
treatments relative to the oil only control. In the CdCl 2 amended soil 
communities, the mean Rhodococcal  16S rRNA ge ne abundances were 5.22 X 
106 ± 2.4 X 106, 2.91 X 105 ± 3.64 X 104 and 1.61 X 103 ± 5.43 X 102 
sequences at 0.1, 10 and 1000 ppm, respectively. These were significantly 
lower by 7.26 X 106 ± 1.99 X 106, 1.22 X 107 ± 1.99 X 106 and 1.25 X 107 ± 
1.99 X 106 sequences at 0.1 (p= 0.01), 10 (p<0.0001) and 1000 (p<0.0001) 
ppm Cd respectively, relative to oil only amended soils. Also, in CdO  172  amended soils, the mean Rhodococcal  16S rRNA gene abundances were 1.43 
X 105 ± 6.04 X 103 and 1.84 X 102 ± 1.60 X 101 sequenc es at 10 and 1000 
ppm Cd, respectively. Hence relative to the microbial community of the soil 
amended with oil, only, the 16S rRNA gene abundance of Rhodococcus  were 
significantly lower by 1.25 X 107 ± 1.99 X 106 and 1.25 X 107 ± 1.99 X 106 at 
10 and 1000 ppm Cd, respectively.  
In general, there is a systematic logarithmic relationship between the 
concentration of added cadmium and Rhodococcal abundance (see figure 
5.21). Regression analysis indicated there was a significant negative 
relationship between Cd  concentration and the abundance of Rhodococcus, 
which is logarithmic in both CdCl2 (R2= 0.79 p=0.036) and CdO CdCl2 (R2= 
0.75 p=0.037) amended soils Hence, increase in Cd concentration resulted in 
an exponential decrease in Rhodococcus  abundance.  
Furtherm ore, comparison of treatments with soil only control determined the 
Cd impact of the Cd -oil amendment on the general soil bacteria. In CdCl2 
amended soils, the mean bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance was 
significantly lower at 1000 ppm Cd (p=0.006) relative  to the soil only control 
and the difference in the means relative to soil only control were 5.30 X 107 ± 
9.84 X 106.   However, mean bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance was not 
significantly different at 0.1 (p=0.673) and 10 ppm (p=0.281) relative to soil 
only control. In addition, relative to the soil only control, the bacterial 16S 
rRNA gene abundances in the CdO contaminated soil community were 
significantly lower by 4.92 X 107 ± 9.86 X 106   and 4.97 X 107 ± 9.86 X 106   
at 10 ppm Cd (p=0.013) and 1000 p pm Cd (p=0.007), respectively. However, 
at 0.1 ppm Cd, the mean bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance was not 
significant, relative to soil only control (p=0.93).  
The Rhodococcal  abundance in the unamended soil community (soil only 
control) was compared with treatments using Dunnett’s pairwise comparison 
(see figure 5.21) to determine the impact of Cd on the abundance of 
Rhodococcus in communities. Analysis indicated that relative to soil only 
control, the mean 16S rRNA gene abundance of the microbial communit y of 
soil amended with CdO at 0.1 ppm Cd was significantly higher (p<0.0001). 
However, the mean 16S rRNA gene abundance of other Cd amended  173  microbial community of soil, irrespective of form or concentration was not 
significantly different relative to the s oil only control (p>0.1).

5.4.7 . Numerical relationships between cumulative CO 2, maximal CO 2 
production rates, recovered petroleum hydrocarbons after degradation 
period, Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene abundances and Rhodococcus  16S 
rRNA Gene abundances  
In this project, geochemical and microbiological approaches were employed to 
study the biodegradation of p etroleum hydrocarbon in Cd -petroleum 
contaminated soils. The results obtained from the geochemical and 
microbiological experiments have been presented separately in previous 
sections. Here, a correlation analysis between these different variables was 
condu cted to identify the relationship between these. Specifically, a matrix 
based correlation analyses of cumulative CO 2, maximal CO 2 production rate, 
total n -alkanes recovered after degradation period, Bacterial 16S rRNA gene 
abundance and 16S rRNA gene abund ance of Rhodococcus  was carried out to 
achieve this. Pearson’s correlations were used to determine the strength of 
relationships between variables (see table 5.4).   176  5.4.7.1. Correlation of 16S rRNA gene abundance of bacteria relative 
Rhodococcal 16S rRNA ge ne abundance in soil communities  
The Pearson’s correlation analysis identified a moderate positive linear 
relationship between 16S rRNA gene abundances of Rhodococcus  and 
bacteria (a proxy measure of the absolute abundance of Rhodococcus  and 
bacteria cells  in soil communities) (see figure 5.22), which was significant 
(r2= 0.54, r=0.74, P=0.0001). Hence, bacterial enrichment in the Cd 
contaminated petroleum degrading soils was due to the enrichment of 
Rhodococcus  in these systems to a reasonable extent. This  identifies the 
importance of Rhodococcus  in the degrading soil systems.  
5.4.7 .2     Correlation of 16S rRNA gene abundances (Bacteria and 
Rhodococcus ) relative to maximal cumulative CO2 during the 
degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil microcosms  
 The relationship between 16S rRNA gene abundances of bacteria and 
maximum cumulative CO 2 in communities is a significant positive linear 
relationship (p=0.001) (see figure 5.23). With r -value of 0.65 (i.e. R2=0.43), 
there is an indication that not all CO 2 produced is in microcosms is linked to 
bacterial abundance. This may suggest that not all species in the microbial 
communities are involved in petroleum mineralisation on soil amendment with 
the metal and petroleum. Hence, not all bacteria species in the community are 
hydrocarbon degraders. On the other hand, the relationship between 16S 
rRNA gene abundance of Rhodococcus  in communities is a significant strong 
positive linear relationship (r= 0.89 r2=0.80 p<0.0001) relative to maximal 
CO 2 produced by micro bial communities (see figure 5.24 and table 5.4). 
Hence, an increase in Rhodococcus  indicates an increase in CO 2 production. 
This observation may suggest that Rhodococcus  dominance in communities 
resulted to increased microbial activities in the soils, whi ch imply an increase 
in crude oil mineralisation to CO 2. 
  177  5.4.7 .3  Correlation between 16S rRNA gene abundance (of 
bacterial and Rhodococcus ) and maximal rate of CO 2 production during 
the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon in soil microcosms  
The relation ship between 16S rRNA gene abundance of bacteria and 
Rhodococcus with the maximal rate of CO 2 production is similar to that with 
maximum CO 2 produced as described above.

gene of bacteria and maximal rate of CO 2 production was significantly weak 
positive relationship (r=0.64 , r2=0.39 , p=0.002) (see table 5.4 and figure 5.25).  
However, the correlation between Rhodococcal  16S rRNA gene abundance 
and maximal rate of CO 2 production indicate a strong positive linear 
relationship between the variables (r =0.88, r2= 0.78 p<0.0001 ) (see table 5.4 
and figure 5.26).  These observations imply that the increased abundance of 
Rhodococcus  stimulated the biodegradation of crude oil in soils.  
 
5.4.7 .4 Correlation of 16S rRNA gene (bacterial and Rhodococcal) 
relativ e to Total petroleum hydrocarbon recovered after the degradation 
of petroleu m hydrocarbon in soil microcosms  
The correlation analyses revealed that there is a significant weak negative 
linear relationship between bacterial abundance and the total n -alkanes  
recovered from soil microcosms after degradation of petroleum crude oil (r= -
0.65; r2=0.43, p=0.0013) (see table 5.4 and figure 5.28). However, spearman’s 
correlation analysis identified a significant moderately strong non -linear 
relationship between bacte rial abundance and total n -alkanes recovered (r= -
0.72; r2=0.51, p=0.0003). In addition , the linear relationship between 
Rhodococcus  and total n -alkanes is moderately strong and significant (r= -0.75; 
r2=0.56, p<0.0001) (see table 5.4 and figure 5.28), but s pearman’s correlation 
indicated a strong significant negative non -linear relationship between 
Rhodococcal  abundance and total n -alkanes (r= -0.83; r2=0.70, p<0.001). The 
negative relationships imply that increase in abundance of bacteria and 
Rhodococcus  results to decrease in the recovered total n -alkanes. Hence, this 
indicates that increased the abundance of bacteria and Rhodococcus  results to 
increased petroleum hydrocarbon degradation.   179

5.5. Discu ssions  
In this section, the results of microbiological and geological analysis of Cd -oil 
amended systems are discussed in details from different points of views to 
derive a more holistic understanding of the complex systems and this approach 
is lacking in previous studies.  
5.5.1. Inhibitory effect of Cd on microbial activities and biodegradation of 
petroleum in the soils  
The results obtained from current study indicated that Cd inhibited the 
biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon in soil microcosms during the 
period of degradation. This may be attributed to inhibition of the proliferation 
of petroleum hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms due to inhibition of 
enzyme activities in soils.  
The determination of the absolute abundance of the 16S rRNA gene in soi ls 
indicated that bacterial abundance increased during the biodegradation of 
petroleum hydrocarbon in the soils. However, amendment with Cd in higher  183  concentrations resulted in decreased bacterial abundance. Increasing Cd 
concentration decreased in bacteri al abundance even more. A decline in 
Rhodococcus  abundance with increasing concentration of Cd was also 
observed. The inhibition of microbial proliferation observed in this study 
agrees with the studies by Zibilske, L.M. and Wagner (1982) who observed 
Cd i nhibition of soil bacteria at Cd concentrations of 0.1 , 1 and 111 
micrograms per gramme Cd after a period of two weeks. Apart from soil 
environment, investigation on the influence of Cd, Pb and Cu on petroleum 
degradation in estuarine sediments from River Lima indicated that the 
amendment of the sandy sediment with Cd significantly decreased the total 
cell count of petroleum degraders (Almeida et al. 2013). In addition, Hoffman 
et al. (2005), in their study on effects  of Cd toxicity studies on naphthalene 
degradation, documented decline in the growth of a Comamonas testosteroni  
strain (isolated from sediment of river Oshkosh, USA and which has the 
capability to degrade Naphthalene) at Cd concentration of 100 and 500 μM 
despite differences in the pattern and degree of inhibition, which was 
dependent on the mineral salt medium used.  
Both bacteria and Rhodococcus  abundances significantly correlated positively 
with maximal degradation rates and maximum CO2 produced in microcosms 
due to petroleum mineralisation, b ut negatively with the total alkane  recovered 
from microcosms. Also, results indicated that while maximal rates of 
degradation and maximum CO 2 produced in microcosms decreased with 
increased Cd concentration, recovered total n -alkanes  increased with increa sed 
Cd-concentrations. These observations were consistent with previous 
researches. For instance, (Dar and Mishra 1994) documented Cd inhibition of 
Carbon and Nitrogen mineralisation in sludge amended and unamended soils. 
Also, results from the present stu dy suggested that a decrease in the rate of 
microbial metabolic activity reflected inhibition of important microbial 
metabolic pathways catalysed by enzymes, hence signifying inhibition of the 
enzymes in the systems. Although research on enzyme activities in Cd -
petroleum co -contaminated soils are lacking, past research on the effect of Cd 
on enzyme activities is well documented. For instance, Cd has been 
documented to inhibit dehydrogenase activities in the soil (Dar 1996; Pan and 
Yu 2011; Alrumman et al. 2 015). Dar (1996) identified inhibition of 
dehydrogenase activity in sludge amended and unamended soils at 10 and 50  184  microgram Cd per gramme soil. Also, increased inhibition with increased 
concentration of Cd was observed. In addition to this finding, Pan a nd Yu 
(2011) observed significant decreases in soil dehydrogenase activity at 10, 50 
and 100 ppm Cd.  Dehydrogenase activity is usually used as an indicator for 
evaluating microbial oxidative activity in soils (Vig et al. 2003). Other soil 
enzymes importan t in nutrient cycles that were inhibited by Cd included 
Urease, nitrogenase and phosphatase (Khan et al. 2010; Pan and Yu 2011; Dar 
1996; Baldrian et al. 2000). Cd inhibits enzyme activities through different 
mechanisms including binding to the active site  of an enzyme to reduce 
enzyme sensitivity, interacting with the enzyme -substrate complex, affecting 
the synthesis of enzyme within cells and inducing the production of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen oxide (H 2O2) and superoxide radicals 
(O2-) thereby imposing oxidative stress and consequently leading to the 
damage to DNA, Lipids and proteins (Nies 1992; Nies 1999; Sandrin and 
Maier 2003; Harrison et al. 2007; Abha and Singh 2012; Lemire et al. 2013). 
These mechanisms were discussed in chapte r 1. 
5.5.2.     Bioavailability of Cd and uptake by microbes  
The deleterious effect of Cd on petroleum degrading soils’ metabolic activities, 
soil microbes, hydrocarbon degrader proliferation and consequent negative 
effect on petroleum degradation may be a ttributed to the susceptibility of soil 
microbes to Cd. However, the degree of susceptibility of microbes to the 
toxicity of Cd largely depends on the bioavailability of Cd. Results from Cd 
partitioning in the soil indicated that a good percentage of Cd, 2 6% in CdCl 2 
and 12% in CdO contaminated soils, were in form of free Cd cation in the soil 
solution (exchangeable cations), which are the most mobile form of the metal 
in soils (Tessier et al. 1979; Vig et al. 2003; Gadd 2010; Tashakor et al. 2015). 
This re sult implies that this percentage are may be readily available to soil 
biota including microbes.  Metal toxicity in soils has been shown to 
significantly correlate with the free metal ion in the soils (Prokop et al. 2003 
and references therein).  
In this s tudy, significant differences were observed in the percentage of free 
Cd ions between the Cd forms. This difference may be attributed to the 
solubility of the forms where CdCl 2 is more soluble.  It is not surprising that  185  more Cd ions were observed in the so il solution compared to the insoluble 
CdO.  
Furthermore, good percentages of the Cd in soils were associated with oxides 
of Fe and Mn and Organic components of the soils. This observation explains 
the mode of Cd transportation into the microbial cells. The organics soil 
fraction may include the soil organisms, soil microbes, enzymes and proteins, 
humic and fulvic acids etc.  (Tessier et al. , 1979). This may suggest that a 
good amount of Cd may have been immobilised intracellular in soil’s 
microorganisms and may confirm the susceptibility of Cd to soil microbes.  
The Cd is transported into the microbial cells through specific and non -
specific transporters, which are essential for the  uptake of physiologically 
important trace metals and nutrients by the cells ( Nies 1992; Nies 1999; 
Lemire et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2007). For instance, the P -type transporter 
which transports Mn into cells also transported Cd in cells of Bacillus subtilis 
(Laddaga et al. 1985 ), Staphylococcus aureus  (Weiss et al. 1978; Silver e t al. 
1989; Gómez -Sanz et al. 2013; Nucifora et al. 1989) and Lactobacillus 
plantarum  (Hao, Chen, et al. 1999; Hao, Reiske, et al. 1999). Other examples 
include the transportation of Cd through Zn -specific transports ZipB and ZupT 
in Bordetella bronchisept ica (Lin et al. 2010) and E. coli (Grass et al. 2005; 
Taudte and Grass 2010) respectively. In addition, essential trace metals such 
as Fe are transported bound to low molecular weight ligands such as 
phosphates, peptides, amino acids and organics. Non -essential trace metals 
such as Cd may substitute the essential trace metals and hence are transported 
instead. For instance, the Fe -siderophore transport system is also employed in 
the transportation of Cd into microbial cells (Lemire et al., 2013). The 
associ ation of Cd to oxides of Fe and Mn indicates the reducible state of a 
percentage of Cd in the soil. This is required for easy mobility of Cd, 
including uptake by living cells.  
In this project, Rhodococcus  was the key hydrocarbon degrader in the system. 
Although the mechanism of Cd uptake was not studied in this project, in a 
previous research, genes encoding heavy metal transport systems were 
identified in the genome of Butane -Oxidizing Actinobacterium , Rhodococcus  
ruber  IEGM 231.   186  5.5.3.    Microbial commun ity diversity and phylogeny  
In this project, DGGE analysis indicated that the microbial communities of 
soils are highly diverse. However, a slight decrease in community diversity 
was encountered in petroleum -contaminated microcosms, with or without Cd. 
This is due to enrichment of a few OTUs, which lead to the lower number of 
overall species being detected. This is similar to observations made in the 
previous study by Li et al. (2007) whereby a slight lowering in the diversity of 
soil microbial communities  was observed within 15 days of the onset of 
petroleum degradation. Furthermore, alpha diversity studies using sequence 
data obtained by ion -torrent PGM sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA gene 
identified more diverse communities in Cd -contaminated petroleum degrading 
soils compared to the soil control amended with oil, only . This indicated that 
apart from petroleum hydrocarbon degraders, Cd -resistant microbes might 
have proliferated on the amendment with Cd consequently increasing the 
diversity of the communi ty. In their study, Li et al. (2006) observed increased 
diversity in soils co -contaminated with Cd, Zn, and Cu due to the tolerance of 
metals of the members of the microbial community.  Also, diverse community , 
which included low and high G +C bacteria,  was observed in soils co -
contaminated with Pb, Cr and Hydrocarbons (Joynt et al. 2006a).  
Phylogenetic studies carried out indicated that the most enriched taxonomic 
group that made up 50% of the microbial relative abundance in petroleum 
degrading systems wi th or without Cd were members of the phylogenetic 
groups Actinobacteria , α-Proteobacteria , ß-Proteobacteria , γ-Proteobacteria , 
Bacteriodetes , Chloroflexi  and Crenarchaeota . Rhodococcus  sp. belonging to 
the Actinobacterial phylum was the most abundant in al l degraded 
microcosms. Moreover, additional phylogenetic groups were identified in Cd 
amended systems. These included the Firmicutes , Planctomycetes , 
Acidobacteria  and Verucomicrobia . Members of the observed taxonomic 
groups have been enriched in hydrocarb on degrading/ degraded systems in 
previous studies. For instance, the taxonomic group associated with members 
of the Actinobacterial  groups including Corynebacterium , Dietzia , 
Rhodococcus  erythropolis , and Nocardioides  were isolated from a petroleum -
contam inated soil (Chikere et al. 2012). Also , strains  closely relating to 
Rhodococcus  and Gordonia  (both Actinobacteria ) were isolated from  187  hydrocarbon contaminated Mediterranean shoreline (Quatrini et al. 2008). 
Apart from Actinobacteria , other phyla identifie d in this study have been 
previously acknowledged as hydrocarbon  degraders. For instance, both 
Actinobacteria  and α-, ß- and γ-Proteobacteria  were isolated in an Austrian 
petroleum -contaminated alpine soil (Labbé et al. 2007). The importance of 
Proteobacteria  in petroleum degradation is also well acknowledged. In their 
review , Head  et al. (2006) represented major hydr ocarbon degraders on a 
phylogenetic tree; including Firmicutes , α-Proteobacteria , ß-Proteobacteria  
and γ-Proteobacteria . Apart from the Actinobacteria  and Proteobacteria,  
other bacterial groups have been isolated from hydrocarbon contaminated soils. 
For in stance, 16Sr RNA genes closely related to strains of Proteobacteria, 
Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, 
Cyanobacteria and Acidobacteria  were isolated from aromatic hydrocarbon 
degrading Antartica soils and sediments (M uangchinda et al. 2014). Apart 
from soils, these organisms were also enriched in other hydrocarbon 
environments such as marine sediments (Hazen et al. 2010; Cai et al. 2014), 
petroleum contaminated groundwater (Hao et al. 2009), river/estuarine 
sediments ( Leahy and Colwell 1990; LI et al. 2007; Hale et al. 2010). Also, 
similar taxonomic groups were observed in petroleum -heavy metal co -
contaminated systems (Amor et al. 2001; Máthé et al. 2012; Joynt et al. 2006a; 
Almeida et al. 2013) and Cd contaminated envi ronments (Ivshina et al. 2013).  
Certain synergistic interaction exists amongst the members of microbial 
communities petroleum contaminated environments. Head et al (2006) pointed 
out the synergetic interaction between members of communities in the 
petroleu m-contaminated  environment as a strategy of survival by the microbes. 
This might be the case in this community. For instance, the enrichment of 
Rhodococcus  and Pseudomonas  in the systems is  evidence of the community 
interaction. The role of Rhodococcus  in petroleum degradation is well 
documented. Primarily, the strains of Rhodococcus  sp. have  enzyme systems 
that enable the production of biosurfactants. Their abundance in the 
communities observed might suggest their key role of petroleum 
emulsification to si mpler molecules, thereby making the petroleum 
hydrocarbon easily accessible to other members of the communities. Also, 
biosurfactant produced by Rhodococcus  may have immobilised Cd to some 
extent (especially at a low concentration of Cd) thereby promoting the thriving  188  of other members of the microbial community such as Pseudomonas , 
Norcadia , Mycobacterium , Achromobacter , Rhodoplanes , e. t. c. metal 
resistance mechanism will be discussed in details the next section. In the same 
way, well acknowledged the cap ability of Pseudomonas  strains to degrade 
petroleum hydrocarbon (Sharma et al. 2015; Obayori et al. 2013; Barathi and 
Vasudevan 2001; Kumar et al. 2006) may portray the role of Pseudomonas  in 
the system. There is a possibility that Pseudomonas  were enriche d after 
emulsification of petroleum hydrocarbon by biosurfactant produced by 
Rhodococcus . The previous research reported improved efficiency of 
petroleum degradation by Pseudomonas sp.  in the presence of biosurfactant 
producing bacteria (Kumar et al. 2006) . Apart from hydrocarbon degradation, 
strains of Pseudomonas were documented to depend on biosurfactant as a 
source of energy (Colores et al. 2000) in other to control biosurfactant 
secretion in the environment.  
5.5.4    Cd -resistant mechanism in Microcos ms 
Phylogenetic results revealed that while the relative abundance of hydrocarbon 
degraders e.g. Norcardia  and Mycobacterium  decreased in Cd -contaminated 
soils, the relative abundance of other hydrocarbon degraders such as 
Rhodococcus  and Pseudomonas  were not affected in the systems (see figure 
4.12). It has been documented that several microbes demonstrate resistance to 
Cd (Bruins et al. 2000). Microbes adapt to metal presence by developing the 
mechanism of metal resistance. Theses mechanisms may include e xtracellular 
and intracellular sequestration, efflux system development , cell  repair 
mechanism, metabolic by -pass and contaminant detoxification by chemical 
modification (Nies 1999; Nies 2003; Harrison et al. 2007; Lemire et al. 2013).  
As has been pointed  out in the previous section, the primary microbes 
enriched in petroleum degraded system is closely related to strains of 
Rhodococcus  sp. Rhodococcus  is a highly metabolically and physiologically 
versatile organism and has been associated with both hydroca rbon degradation 
and metal resistance ( Murai 1981; Desomer et al. 1988; Finnerty 1992; Larkin 
et al. 2005; Larkin et al. 2006; Martínková et al. 2009; Binazadeh et al. 2009; 
White et al. 2013). However, relatively little is known about the mechanism of 
metal resistance in Rhodococcus . The Ivshina  and Kuyukina (2014) identified 
genes that encode enzymes that catalyse versatile metabolic activities in a  189  strain of Rhodococcus  including genes for hydrocarbon degradation, 
biosurfactant production, and active tra nsport systems. Active transport might 
give an insight into the mechanism of metal resistance by Rhodococcus  sp., 
which might include metal resistance by sequestration and active efflux 
systems.  
In addition to this, plasmids encoded Cd -resistance gene has been reported in 
strains of Rhodococcus  fasciens  (Desomer et al. 1988; Murai 1981). Murai 
reported 99 KB plasmid in R. fasciens  strains MW2, which bears Cd -resisting 
gene. The loss of the plasmid corresponded to the loss of Cd -resistance and 
hydrocarbon ut ilisation by the strain. In addition, the 138 KB Cd -resistance 
gene bearing Plasmid pD188 was reported by Desomer et al 1988 in strains of 
R. fasciens  strain D188. The plasmid correlated strictly with Cd -resistance. 
The presence of pD188 in mutants, which were previously sensitive to Cd, 
resulted in Cd resistance in the mutant strains.  
Primarily, microbes resist Cd by developing energy dependent efflux systems, 
which  facilitate the export of Cd from the cell. For instance , P-type ATPase, 
CadA pump, which wa s responsible for the transportation of Cd out of Cd -
resistant Staphylococcus aureus  documented in previous studies (Nies 1992; 
Nies 1999; Nies 2003; Nucifora et al. 1989). Also, a csz system (comprising 
of cszA, cszB and cszC proteins, with cszD as determ inant) was identified in 
Cd-resistant strains of Alcaligenes eutrophus  (Nies 1999), Ralstonia sp. (Nies 
2000; Anton et al. 1999) and Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans (Chen et al. 2014).  
Apart from resistance based on efflux systems, microbes have been 
docume nted to confer resistance to Cd by metal sequestration intracellularly. 
For instance,  (Hrynkiewicz et al. 2014 ) attributed  the Cd -resistance observed 
in Cd tolerating Pseudomonas sp.  IV-111-16 and Bacillus sp. ML1 -2 isolated 
from rhizosphere, Ectomycorrhi zae, and fruit bodies of Ectomycorrhizal f ungi 
associated with willows ( Salix viminalis L .) growing at anthropogenic 
degraded sites to intracellular detoxification of Cd by the formation of  Cd-
phosphates. In addition, Silicate binding by  Bacillus  sp. ML1 -2 was identified. 
Also, intracellular sequestration of Cd by cysteine and glutathione in  
Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans has been identified (Zheng et al. 2015).   190  Furthermore, Cd resistance by extracellular sequestration has been well 
documented. This strateg y involves the exclusion of Cd from the cell by 
immobilisation of the metal thereby preventing uptake by cells. For example, 
the sequestration of Cd by extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) of Cd -resistant 
Sinorhizobum , Pseudomonas  putida  and other bacterial  strains has  been 
identified (Slaveykova et al. 2010; Ueshima et al. 2008; Wei et al. 2011; 
Guibaud et al. 2005) and Biosurfactants are usually a good example of EPS.  
Conclusions  
The aim of this project was to understand the effect of Cd, in different form s 
and at concentrations on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon in soils. 
Using geochemical and microbiological approaches, the Cd effects on the 
Microbial activities, the compositional change of petroleum, changes in 
microbial community diversity a nd phylogeny were established holistically.  
Results from investigations revealed that Cd inhibited microbial activities in 
soils, irrespective of Cd form or concentrations even at concentrations below 
the recommended soil guideline values of UK environmen tal agency and 
below the intervention value of Dutch list. The inhibitory effect increased with 
increasing concentration. This is likely due to the toxicity of Cd binding to the 
active site of enzymes to reduce enzyme sensitivity, interacting with an 
enzym e-substrate complex, affecting the synthesis of the enzyme within cells 
and inducing the production of ROS thereby imposing oxidative stress and 
consequently leading to the damages of DNA, Lipids and proteins. In addition 
to this, the total n -alkanes  recov ered from microcosms after degradation 
period indicated that very little percentage of petroleum was degraded in Cd 
amended microcosms.  
Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis results indicated that Cd inhibited the 
proliferations of hydrocarbon degraders in s oils. However, the hydrocarbon 
degrader, Rhodococcus , which dominated the microbial community, was less 
affected than Mycobacterium , Nocardia  and Pseudomonas . These results 
suggest that there is resilience in these soils whereby even though some 
hydrocarbo n degraders are inhibited at low Cd others including the 
Rhodococcus  are able to carry on degrading. This resilience /redundancy is  191  further illustrated when you consider the effect of Pb in the next chapter where 
the Rhodococcus  was not dominant.  
Rhodococc us is known for its metabolic versatility, which includes 
hydrocarbon degradation as well as Cd resistance. The role of Rhodococcus  in 
the soil may be to increase the availability of petroleum hydrocarbons to other 
members of the microbial community by pro ducing biosurfactants while 
resisting Cd. Despite the Cd -resistance capability, the proliferations of 
Rhodococcus  in microcosms were inhibited with increasing Cd concentration.  
Although this study established the toxicity of Cd on the biodegradation of 
petroleum hydrocarbon in soil, the resistance of Cd by the dominant 
hydrocarbon degraders in the degrading system was not studied. For future 
studies, understanding the resistance mechanisms of Cd employed by 
hydrocarbon degraders through genetic studies wil l contribute to engineering 
strategies required for the bioremediation of Cd -petroleum co -contaminated 
soils.

Effect of Lead on the Bioremediation of Petroleum 
Hydrocarbons  
6.1. Introduction  
Lead (Pb) is a member of group 14 in the p eriod table with an atomic number 
of 82 and an atomic mass of 207.2. Pb exists majorly as the Plumbous ion (Pb 
II) in nature (Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment 1999 and 
references therein) and alloys readily with Tin (Sn), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu) 
and Antimony (Sb).  Pb minerals include galena (PbS), cerussite (PbCO3) and 
anglesite (PbSO4) (Anthony et al. 1990). Also, It is a non -essential element 
(i.e. element not required for any physiological or biochemical processes) for 
living organisms an d ubiquitous in the soil. Its average concentration in the 
Earth’s crust is 16 mg kg−1 and the background concentration natural 
uncontaminated soils varies with soil (Domy C. Adriano 2001). For instance, 
In England, the background value of Pb in urban regi ons varied from 36 ppm 
in Corby to 224 ppm in Swansea (Rothwell and Cooke 2015). Also, whereas 
in Canada, the average background value of Pb is 20 ppm in Poland, the 
average background value of Pb is 10.3 ppm (Domy C. Adriano 2001). Pb 
contamination, toget her with Cd and As, is of great global concern (UNEP 
2010). In contaminated soils, the value of Pb varies from 10s of mg Pb Kg -1 
soil to thousands of mg Pb Kg -1 soil depending on the source of 
contamination. Pb could be released into the environment as a r esult of natural 
events (such as weathering of rock and volcanoes) as well as anthropogenic 
activities; Metals are released into the environment from mining of metal ores 
and fossil fuels, petrol additives, agricultural activities and manufacturing 
activit ies (UNEP 2010; Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, 
1999). More important to this study is the contamination of Pb due to oil spills. 
Pb in petroleum could be up to thousands of µg Pb Kg -1 soil (see table 1.2 in 
chapter 1). Continuous release  of petroleum (accidental or deliberate) due to 
exploration, mining and transportation activities deposits the accompanying 
Pb leading to a build up of Pb to levels above the soil guideline values may 
result (see table 1.1 in chapter 1). The UK environment al agency’s soil 
guideline value (SGV) for Pb is currently being evaluated but the previous UK  193  environmental agency’s SGV for Pb is 530 ppm (i.e. mg Pb Kg -1 soil) 
(Mccann 2012; Okorie 2010; Okorie et al. 2011; Okorie et al. 2012). In 
Canada, the SGV for ag ricultural soils is 70 ppm (Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment 1999) and the Dutch list value for soil Pb  
intervention level is 530 ppm (ESDAT 2000).  
6.2.    Aims and objective  
The aim of this research is to determine the effect of Pb on hydr ocarbon 
degradation in complex natural soil systems using microbial ecological 
approach combined with the geochemical approach.  
1. The objectives include  
2. To determine the effect of different mineral forms of Pb at increasing 
concentrations on the biodegradati on of petroleum hydrocarbon by 
determining the rate of microbial metabolic activities in oil and Pb 
contaminated soils,  
3. To determine the compositional changes of whole petroleum in the soil 
contaminated with different mineral forms of Pb at different 
conce ntrations using geochemical analytical techniques,  
4. To determine the ecological diversity of microorganisms in soils 
contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon and different forms of Pb at 
increasing concentrations during the biodegradation of petroleum 
hydroc arbon,  
5. To determine the effect of long -term metal contamination on 
petroleum hydrocarbon degradation  
6. To determine the fate of Pb in a hydrocarbon -contaminated system.  
6.3. Methods  
The basic experimental microcosm setup, the geochemical and molecular 
micro biological techniques used to investigate the effect of Pb on petroleum 
degradation are described in detail in chapter 2. Briefly, this Pb orientated 
study employed two different soil systems to evaluate hydrocarbon 
degradation with the freshly added metal  contaminant (analogous to the Ni 
and Cd experiments) and; in a soil system where the metal contamination was 
historic and thus aged. The Nafferton Ecological Soils were used to 
understand the effect of freshly added Pb contamination on petroleum  194  degradati on and a soil with a history of long -term Pb contamination obtained 
from former lead ore smelting works at St. Anthony’s, Newcastle upon Tyne 
(see chapter 2, section 2.1).  
 
The soil microcosms used to investigate the effects of Pb addition (in different 
mineral forms) consisted of added Pb, petroleum crude oil and Nafferton soil 
(see figure 6.1). The effect of two forms of added Pb (PbCl2 and PbS) was 
investigated at increasing concentrations 150, 1500 and 15000 ppm.  
Soil microcosms used to investigate the  biodegradation of crude oil in 
historically contaminated Pb soil involved the amendment of soils containing 
lower Pb concentrations (~500 ppm) and high concentrations (~12000 ppm) 
with crude oil. The soil sample site was described previously in Chapter 2,  
section 2.1. These soil microcosms were set up in triplicate for all treatments 
and controls to allow for statistical analysis.  
For experiments investigating the effect of short -term Pb contamination on 
petroleum crude oil degradation, two sets of control  soil microcosms were set 
up. The controls were crude oil only amended soil microcosms and soil only 
microcosms. For experiments investigating the effect of historical Pb 
contamination, High -Pb soils and Low -Pb soils (with no crude oil amendment) 
served as  controls.  
All microcosms were incubated at room temperature for a period of 14 days. 
Soil microbial activities were monitored in each microcosm replicate by 
periodically measuring CO 2 production of headspace gases at 2 -day intervals 
by GC -MS analysis (se e Chapter 2, section 2. 5). After incubation, 
microcosms were subjected to geochemical and microbiological analysis as 
described in the previous chapters and outlined in Chapter 2, sections 2.6 and 
2.8).

amended and no oil amended (soil only) controls. Freshly Pb contaminated soils were studied 
at concentrations of 150, 1500 and  15000 ppm. Long -term Pb -contaminated soils include 
lower Pb soils (lower Pb concentration of ~500 ppm) and High Pb Soils (high Pb 
concentration of ~13000 ppm).  
6.4. Results  
This section presents the results of the microbial respiratory activity, 
geochemis try and microbial community studies of the petroleum degrading 
soil microcosms contaminated with Pb.  
6.4.1.    Physicochemical properties of soils  
The soils used for this investigation were analysed to determine background 
levels of metal contamination (Ta ble 6.1). Comparisons of values with SGV 
provided an evidence of no metal contamination in Nafferton farm soil. In 
contrast, in the St Anthony soil samples, contamination by metals, primarily 
As, Zn, Pb and Cd, occurred. This observation coincided with pre vious reports 
on a physicochemical analysis of Anthony works (Okorie et al. 2012; Mccann 
2012; Okorie et al. 2011).  
In addition to metal concentrations, the pH and total organic carbon (TOC) of 
the soils were determined. The pH of the soils was approximat ely neutral. 
Nafferton soil had a pH of 7.1±0.03, lower Pb soil had pH of 7.1±0.06 and 
high Pb soil had a pH of 7.83±0.18. TOC values were 3.13±0.12%, 
6.26±0.47% and 6.47±1.17% for the Nafferton, lower Pb Anthony and high 
Pb Anthony soils respectively.   196  Table 6.1: Concentrations of Metal in Nafferton Ecological Farm and St.

6.4.2.     Effect of Pb on soil Microbial activities  
CO 2 production profiles, maximum cumulative CO 2 values and maximal CO 2 
production rates in oil only amended soi ls and unamended soil (i. e. soil only 
control) were compared to understand the impact of oil amendment on CO 2 
production. Metal and oil treated soils were then compared to these controls to 
ascertain the effect of Pb addition on oil degradation.  
6.4.2.1. Effect of short -term Pb contamination on oil degradation in the 
Nafferton farm soils  
The CO 2 production profile observed in oil -amended and PbS or PbCl 2 
amended soils at Pb concentrations of 150, 1500 and 15000 ppm were 
compared with the oil only amended soils and with the soil only controls to 
understand the effect of short -term Pb contamination on the degradation 
petroleum degradation in the soils (see figures 6.2 and 6.3). Generally, CO 2 
production profile indicated that CO 2 production in all the Pb ame nded soils, 
irrespective of Pb -form or concentration, was lower relative to the oil only -
amended soil. More specifically, the CO 2 production in the Pb amended soils 
was broadly similar to that of soil only control. To statistically differentiate the 
CO 2 production profile of soils, cumulative CO 2 of treatment soils at different 
time points during the period of degradation were compared relative to oil 
only-amended soil and unamended soil using ANOVA and Dunnett’s pairwise  197  comparison analysis. While CO 2 production increased significantly with time 
in oil only amended soil after a period of lag phase (p<0.0001), there were no 
significant increase in CO 2 production in Pb contaminated soils and 
unamended control over the period of degradation  (p<0.05).  Dunnett ’s 
pairwise comparison analysis revealed that while the CO 2 production profile 
of all Pb amended soils, irrespective of soil form or concentration, were 
significantly different relative to oil only -amended soil (p<0.0001), there was 
no significant differen t relative to unamended soil control (p=0.078).  
The maximum cumulative CO 2 yield (obtained on the 15th day) of all 
treatments were compared relative to the oil only amended soil control. The 
mean maximum cumulative CO2 in oil only amended soil was 0.45 ± 0 .0033 
mmol g-1 dry soil. ANOVA revealed that there were significant differences in 
the cumulative CO 2 across treatments (p<0.0001) relative to the oil only 
amended soil control. Figure 6.4 shows the Dunnett’s pairwise comparison of 
mean maximum cumulative CO 2 of treatments relative to oil only control in 
PbCl 2 and PbS amended soils, respectively. The analysis revealed that there 
were significant differences in mean cumulative CO 2 at all concentrations of 
Pb irrespective of Pb form, relative to the oil only control. In PbCl 2 amended 
soil, the differences in means were significantly lower by 0.375 ± 0.045 mmol 
g-1 dry soil at 150 ppm Pb (p=0.0001), 0.413 ± 0.045 mmol g -1 dry soil at 
1500 ppm Pb (p<0.0001) and 0.488 ± 0.045 mmol g-1 dry soil at 15000 ppm 
Pb, re lative to oil only control. Similarly, in PbS amended soils, the 
differences in means were significantly lower by 0.448 ± 0.045 mols g -1 dry 
soil at 150 ppm Pb (p<0.0001), 0.468 ± 0.045 mmol g -1 dry soil at 1500 ppm 
Pb (p<0.0001) and 0.469 ± 0.045 mmol g-1 dry soil at 15000 ppm Pb , relative 
to oil only control . 
Furthermore, the final cumulative CO 2 yield of treatment microcosms was 
compared with the unamended soil control, which had a mean maximum 
cumulative CO 2 yield of to 0.067 ± 0.0044 mmol g-1 dry soil.  ANOVA and 
Dunnett’s pairwise comparison analysis (see figure 6.5) indicated that the 
mean maximum cumulative CO 2 from PbCl 2 amended soils at 150 ppm and 
1500 ppm Pb were significantly higher relative to soil only control by 0.088 ± 
0.01 mmol g-1 dry soil (p<0.0001) and 0.049 ± 0.01 mmol g -1 dry soil 
(p=0.002), respectively. However, at 15000 ppm Pb, mean maximum  198  cumulative CO 2 was lower by 0.026 ± 0.01 mmol g-1 dry soil and this was not 
significantly different relative to soil only control (p=0.108). In th e PbS 
amended soil the mean maximum cumulative CO 2 at 150 ppm was higher by 
0.014± 0.01 mmol g-1 dry soil but this was not significantly different relative 
to soil only control (p=0.6).  On amendment with PbS at higher concentrations 
of 1500 and 15000 ppm,  the mean maximum cumulative CO 2 observed was 
lower by 0.0056 ± 0.01 mmol g-1 dry soil and 0.006 ± 0.01 mmol g-1 dry soil, 
respectively, relative to soil only control. Equally, these d ifferences were not 
significant.  
The maximal rate of CO 2 production was calculated from the period of 
maximal linear accumulation of CO 2 production in microcosms, which was 
general between days 6 and 10. The rates were presented in figure 6.6. From 
the figure, the maximal rate of CO 2 production in Pb and crude oil -amended 
soils are lower than in the oil only amended soils indicating an inhibitory  
effect of Pb addition. To statistically determine the effect of Pb on the 
maximal rate of degradation, treatment microcosms were compared with oil 
only amended control by ANOVA and Dun nett’s pairwise comparison (see 
figures 6.7 and 6.8). ANOVA indicated that the mean maximal rate of CO 2 
production differed significantly across treatments relative to oil only control 
(p<0.0001). The mean maximal rate of degradation in crude oil only amen ded 
soil was 0.048 ± 0.005 mmols g-1 dry soil day -1. Dunnett’s pairwise 
comparison of Pb and crude oil amended soils relative to oil only control 
indicated that all Pb -crude oil amended soils were significantly lower. The 
mean maximal CO 2 production in PbC l2-crude oil amended soils was 
significantly lower by 0.038 ± 0.0042 mmols g-1 dry soil day-1 (p<0.0001), 
0.044 ± 0.0042 mmols g-1 dry soil day -1 (p<0.0001), 0.046 ± 0.0042 mmols g -
1 dry soil day-1 (p<0.0001) at 150, 1500 and 15000 ppm, respectively, relat ive 
to the oil only control (see figure 6.7). Similarly, in the PbS -crude oil amended 
soils, the mean maximal CO2 production was significantly lower by 0.045 ± 
0.003 mmols g-1 dry soil day-1 (p<0.0001), 0.046 ± 0.003 mmols g-1 dry soil 
day-1 (p<0.0001), 0. 047 ± 0.003 mmols g-1 dry soil day -1 (p<0.0001) at 150, 
1500 and 15000 ppm, respectively, relative to oil only control (see figure 6.8). 
ANOVA indicated that there were no significant differences in between forms 
(p=0.773) and concentrations (p=0.08). Thes e observations suggest that Pb  199  significantly inhibited the maximal rate of crude oil degradation in soils. 
These inhibitory effects were not influenced by Pb form or concentration.

6.4.2.2. Effect of long -term Pb contamination on petroleum degradation 
in soils  
The effect of long -term Pb contamination on the petroleum degradation 
potential in soils was investigated using historically Pb contaminated soil 
amended with crude oil. The daily cumulative CO 2 produc tion profiles in high 
and lower Pb contaminated soil amended with crude were compared to 
controls, which include oil only amended and unamended Nafferton farm soils 
as well as high and lower Pb soils from former Anthony works not amended 
with crude oil (se e figure 6.9).  
Firstly, the CO 2 profiles of the soils historically contaminated with Pb, without 
oil amendment, were analysed by comparing cumulative CO 2 production per 
observed day during degradation. Using ANOVA and Fisher’s multiple 
pairwise comparison  analysis, changes in cumulative CO 2 produced per day 
was compared. Interestingly, from the analysis, only short lag phases, if any,  204  were observed in these soils in comparison to the profile of oil -amended 
Nafferton soil control.  
In soils contaminated wit h low concentrations of Pb, mean cumulative CO 2 
changed from 0.0079 ± 0.0003 to 0.291 ± 0.006 mmol g-1 dry soil over the 15 
days of incubation. Fisher’s analysis indicated that there was a significant 
progressive change in cumulative CO 2 from day 0 to day 15. The change in 
cumulative CO 2 on day 0 was significantly different from that observed on 
day 2 (p=0.05). This implies that there was a very short, if any, lag phase 
observed in the soil. Subsequently, changes in cumulative CO 2 from one 
observed day to t he other were  significant. Furthermore, in high Pb 
contaminated soil, cumulative CO 2 changed from 0.011 ± 0.002 mmol g-1 dry 
soil on day 0 to 0.087 ± 0.006 mmol g-1 dry soil on day 15. Based on Fisher’s 
analysis, there was a significant rise in cumulative CO 2 between day 0 and 2, 
indicating again a short, if any, lag -phase in the soil before the onset of any 
significant CO 2 production. This is followed by a period of reduced CO 2 
production between days 2 and 13. Subsequently, a slight rise in cumulative 
CO 2 was observed between days 13 and 15. Compared to unamended 
Nafferton farm soil using ANOVA, the CO 2 production profile was 
significantly different in low the Pb soils. On the other hand, no significant 
difference in CO 2 production profile was observed in high Pb soils relative to 
unamended Nafferton farm soil.  
On amendment of Pb soils with crude oil, the CO 2 production profile of the 
lower Pb soil was not found to be different relative to lower Pb soil without oil 
(p=0.648). However, the CO 2 production pro file of high Pb soils was 
significantly different on the amendment with oil, relative to the high Pb soil 
not amended with crude oil (p=0.0001). Here, daily cumulative CO 2 changed 
from 0.027 ± 0.008 to 0.175 ± 0.005 mmol g-1 dry soil from day 0 to day 15. 
There was a significant rise in cumulative CO 2 between days 0 and 2. 
Subsequently, daily cumulative CO 2 production levelled off between days 2 
and 15.  
The daily cumulative CO 2 production profile of Pb soils amended with crude 
oil was compared with oil onl y amended Nafferton farm soil. ANOVA 
indicated that the CO 2 production profile in the high Pb soil amended with 
crude oil was significantly different relative to oil only amended Nafferton soil.  205  However, the daily cumulative CO 2 production profiles in the lower Pb soil 
amended with crude oil was not significantly different relative to oil only 
amended Nafferton farm soils. While a short, if any, the lag phase was 
observed in historically contaminated Pb soils, the lag phase observed during 
degradation in oi l Nafferton oil -amended soil was ~6 days. Also, while there 
was a period of more rapid CO 2 production (linear -phase) with a subsequent 
period of lower rates of CO 2 production in oil -amended Nafferton soil and in 
lower Pb soil amended with crude oil, the hi gh Pb soil amended with crude oil 
lacked these changes whereby CO 2 accumulated linearly throughout the 
incubation period.  
Furthermore, the final maximum cumulative CO 2 yield in the historically Pb 
contaminated soils amended with crude oil was determined d uring crude 
degradation in soil microcosms and compared with that of the controls using 
ANOVA and Dunnett’s pairwise comparison tests.  
To understand the effect of crude oil amendment on the final maximum 
cumulative CO 2 yield in microcosms containing low a nd high Pb 
contaminated soils amended with crude oil were compared with the Pb soils 
not amended with crude oil. ANOVA indicated that there were no significant 
differences between lower Pb soils amended with crude oil relative to lower 
Pb soils not amended  with crude oil (p=0.160). However, differences in the 
means of the maximum CO 2 yields was significant in a comparison of the high 
Pb soil amended with crude oil relative to the high Pb soil not amended with 
oil. This result signifies that while amendment of low -Pb soil with crude oil 
did not significantly influence the microbial activities in the soil, in high Pb 
soils, amendment with crude oil resulted in increased microbial activity.  
Furthermore, Pb soils amended with crude oil were compared with Naffer ton 
soil amended with crude oil to determine differences between maximum CO 2 
produced in these different soils. ANOVA revealed that there were significant 
differences across treatments (p=0.0098). Pairwise analysis by Dunnett’s test 
revealed that the mean of maximum CO 2 produced in High -Pb soils amended 
with crude oil was significantly lower relative to oil -amended Nafferton Farm 
soil by 0.339 ± 0.072 mmol g-1 dry soil (p=0.006). However, the mean 
maximum CO 2 produced in lower Pb soils amended with crude oi l was not 
significantly lower relative to oil -amended Nafferton soil by 0.169 ± 0.072  206  mmol g-1 dry soil (p=0.098).  Further analysis that compared high -Pb soils 
amended with crude oil with unamended pristine soil indicated that there were 
no significant di fferences in the mean maximum CO2 between the soils 
(p=0.191).

To determine if Pb contamination a ffected the rates of CO 2 production in soil 
microcosms the historically Pb c ontaminated soils amended with crude were 
compared to the same soil not amended with crude oil. Figure 6.10 shows the 
maximal rate of CO 2 production in treatment microcosm relative to control 
microcosms. From the figure, the rates of CO 2 production in Pb -crude oil 
contaminated soils were lower relative to the oil only control. ANOVA 
indicated that there were significant differences across treatment microcosms 
relative to oil only amended soils (p<0.0001). Figure  6.11 shows the Dunnett’s 
pairwise comparison.  The analysis indicated that the mean maximal rate of 
CO 2 production in the low -Pb soil amended with crude oil was not 
significantly different (differenc es in mean = 0.007 ± 0.005 mmol  g-1 dry soil 
day-1; p=0.429). On the other hand, the  mean maximal rate in CO 2 production 
of high -Pb soils amended with crude oil significantly differ ed relative to oil 
only control by 0.044 ± 0.005 mmol  g-1 dry soil day-1 (p<0.0001). In addition , 
the maximal rates of CO 2 production in the high and lower Pb soils amended 
with crude oil were compared  with high and low lead soils not amended with  208  crude oil  respectively. ANOVA revealed that there were no significant 
differences  in mean maximal CO 2 production rates between crude oil -
amended and u namended high Pb soils (p=0.1). On t he contrary, the mean 
maximal CO 2 production rates in crude oil-amended and unamended soils 
differed significantly such that maximal rates were higher in the crude oil-
amended lower Pb soil relative to unamended lowe r Pb soil by 0.019 ± 0.005 
mmol  g-1 dry soil day-1 (p=0.005).

  209  6.4.3.      The f ate and chemical association of Pb on addition to the farm 
soil microcosms   
Pb amended soils were sequentially extracted to understand the chemical 
associations of the metal in soils.  The aim of this analysis was to understand 
the fate of added Pb in the se soils.  To this end, triplicate soil samples were 
amended with PbS and PbCl 2 at a concentration of 1500 ppm and were 
incubates at room temperature (21 oC) for 7 days.  
Figure 6.12 shows the apparent portioning of the added Pb determined by 
sequential ex traction analysis. There are apparent differences in the 
sequestration of Pb influenced by the different Pb forms investigated. In the 
PbCl 2 amended soil, the mean concentrations associated with the soil 
exchangeable fractions, the carbonates and oxides of  Fe and Mn 473.02 ± 
64.34 ppm Pb (31.53 % of added Pb), 180.20 ± 11.83 ppm Pb (12.01 % of 
added Pb) and 638.57 ±49.07 ppm Pb (42.57 % of added Pb) respectively. For 
the organic and residual fractions, the mean concentrations were 111.44 ± 
12.61 ppm Pb  (7.43 % of added Pb) and 96.78 ± 96.78 ppm Pb (6.45 % of 
added Pb). Based on ANOVA, these concentrations of Pb associated with soil 
fractions are significantly different from each other (p=0.0001).  
On the other hand, in PbS amended soils, the mean concentrati ons of Pb 
associated with exchangeables, the carbonates and oxides of Fe and Mn were 
2.14 ± 0.79 ppm Pb (0.14 % of added Pb), 3.39 ± 0.81 ppm Pb (0.23 % of 
added Pb), 279.16 ± 41.89 ppm Pb (18.61 % of added Pb), respectively. 
Organics and residual fraction s have mean concentrations of 239.96 ± 65.12 
ppm Pb (16 % of added Pb) and 975.34 ± 106.61 ppm Pb (65 % of added Pb), 
respectively. A comparison of Pb partitioning relative to Pb form using 
ANOVA indicated that concentration of Pb associated with the excha ngeables, 
carbonates and oxides of Fe and Mn were significantly lower (p<0.0001) in 
PbS amended soil relative to PbCl 2 amended soils by 470.88 ± 64.35 ppm 
(p=0.0019), 176.80 ± 11.86 ppm (p=0.0001) and 359.41 ± 64.52 ppm (0.0051), 
respectively. Interestingl y, the differences in the mean concentrations of Pb 
associated with the soil organic fraction, which was 128.53 ± 66.33 ppm Pb, 
was not significant (p=0.1247) between forms of added Pb. However, the 
concentration of Pb associated with residuals was signifi cantly higher by 
878.6 ± 144 in PbS soils than in PbCl 2 soils.    210

soil fractions from triplicate amendment experiments. The error bars repres ent the standard 
error these mean values.   
 
6.4.4. Degradation of the alkane component of oil added to the soil 
microcosms  
At the inception of oil degradation experiment, treatment soil microcosms 
were amended with 100 mg crude oil. The residual petroleum  hydrocarbons in 
the soil microcosms amended with crude oil were recovered after the 
degradation period and were analysed by GCFID. Specifically, the n -alkanes 
ranging from n -C11 to n-C32 (see figure 6.13) were isolated and quantified in 
microcosms and con trols to ascertain the degree of petroleum degradation that 
had occurred. The masses of total n -alkanes were determined in microcosms  211  by the summation of individual n -alkane masses recovered from treatment soil 
microcosms, which were also compared with und egraded petroleum  
6.4.4.1. Comparative analysis of total n -alkanes recovered from Pb -crude 
oil degraded soils relative to oil only amended soils and undegraded crude 
oil 
The mean total n -alkane content of the undegraded crude oil was 7313.46  ± 
718.16 μg per 10000 μg of oil mass. In contrast,  the mean total n -alkane mass 
recovered from the oil only amended Nafferton farm soil control after 15 days 
of degradation was 2674.34 ± 495.92  μg. ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s 
pairwise comparison analysis, indicated that mean total n -alkanes recovered 
from the oil only contaminated soil control was significantly lower by 4.64 ± 
0.99 mg (p=0.0011) relative to the alkane content of the equivalent mass of 
undegraded crude oil. However, the mean total n -alkanes recovered from Pb 
contaminated soils irrespective of Pb forms, concentration or duration of 
contamination (long -term or short -term) was not significantly different 
relative to undegraded crude oil.

period of 16 days.  
 
 
 
 
 
  213  To determine the effect of Pb on petroleum degradation, the mean total n -
alkanes of treatment microcosms were compared with mean total n -alkanes of 
the oil only Naffert on amended soil control and the undegraded crude oil. The 
total n-alkanes recovered from the Pb -containing soils, irrespective of forms, 
concentration or duration of contamination (long -term or short -term) were 
higher relative to oil only amended control ( see figure 6.14). ANOVA 
identified that there were differences in mean total n -alkanes across treatments. 
Dunnett’s Pairwise analysis indicated that relative to the oil only control, the 
mean t otal n -alkane recovered from Pb -containing soils, irrespective of Pb 
form, concentration and duration of concentration, were significantly higher 
except for the mean total n -alkanes recovered from PbCl 2 amended soil at 150 
ppm Pb, which was not significantly different (p=0.12).

  214  6.4.5.     Microbial d iversity and Phylogeny.  
Molecular biological methods were used to study the microbial community 
diversity and phylogeny in the experimental microcosms to understand the 
effect of Pb on hydrocarbon degrading soil communities. These methods 
included DGGE com munity fingerprint analysis and ion torrent based deep 
sequencing approaches. For the studies of the short -term Pb contamination 
experiments, microbial communities of crude oil containing soil microcosms 
amended with PbCl 2 and PbS at Pb concentrations of 1 50 and 15000 ppm 
were used.  Microbial communities of historically contaminated Pb soils with 
high and lower Pb concentrations amended with crude oil were also analysed 
after incubation with oil. The diversities and phylogeny of soils were 
compared against  oil only amended and unamended soil controls.  
6.4.5.1.    Denaturing gel electrophoresis indicating the microbial 
communities enrichment influenced by Pb contamination and the 
reproducibility of communities  
DGGE analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was carried o ut to study the microbial 
diversity of communities. Figure 6.15 shows the community diversity profile 
of the 16S rRNA gene fragments on a polyacrylamide gel. Visual analysis of 
gel revealed that the communities were highly diverse, comprising of low 
G+C mi crobes as well as high G+C microbes. Also, a high reproducibility of 
communities from the treatment replicates was observed. In addition, selective 
enrichment of species in communities was observed in petroleum -
contaminated soils (with or without Pb) and i n soils with long -term Pb 
contamination (with or without petroleum). However, soil communities of 
15000 ppm Pb amended Nafferton soil appear to show no selective enrichment 
of species and profiles and thus were comparable to communities of soil 
controls wi thout oil.  
Furthermore, ANOSIM was carried out on communities to statistically 
compare communities. With Global R (R) of 0.926, ANOSIM indicated 
significant differences across communities, which was influenced by the Pb 
forms and the duration of Pb contami nation (p=0.001). In addition, 
community differences were significantly influenced by Pb concentrations 
(R=0.912; p=0.001).   215  Communities were compared with oil only amended soils to identify the effect 
of Pb contamination on the communities of degraded soi ls. A pairwise 
analysis of oil only amended soil community and communities of unamended 
soil identified a significant difference between communities (R= 1; p=0.018). 
This indicated that there was a change in community structure of soil due to 
amendment wit h crude petroleum, which may be because of selective 
enrichment of petroleum degraders in oil only amended soil communities. 
Furthermore, pairwise analysis between oil -amended short -term Pb 
contaminated soils and the oil only amended soil communities revea led that 
community diversities differed significantly (R=1; p=0.012 for the addition of 
PbCl 2 and PbS at 150 ppm). Although communities of oil only amended soil 
control indicated a good discrepancy from the petroleum crude oil -amended 
long-term Pb contamin ated soils, this was not significant (R=1; p=0.1).  
However, communities of Long -term Pb contaminated soils without petroleum 
differed significantly relative to oil only amended soil  (R=1; p=0.029 ( lower 
Pb soil) and R=1; p= 0.01 (High -Pb soil) ).  
These observations imply that Pb influenced microbial community diversity in 
petroleum -degrading systems and Pb influence on microbial community 
diversity was dependent on Pb forms, concentrations and duration of 
contamination. Selective enrichment of petroleum degraders that resist Pb may 
have occurr ed in these Pb soil communities.

Clustering analysis and MDS were also carried to identify similarities between 
communities. Figure 6.16 shows the MDS plot of the communities from Bray -
Curtis similarity m atrix overlaid with similarity contour generated from 
clustering analysis. MDS revealed that the diversities of all communities were 
similar, with a low percentage of 20%. This elaborated the clear separation of 
communities observed in the ANOSIM results. At 40% similarity, all 
communities of Pb soils (both long term and short term Pb soils) were 
clustered with soil only control. At 60% similarity, short -term contaminated 
soils separated from the long -term contaminated soils. In addition, high Pb 
soils sepa rated from lower Pb soils. At 80% similarity, clustering of replicate 
communities was observed indicating a good reproducibility of communities. 
These observations corresponded with the ANOSIM results. Also, the Long -
term Pb soils (with or without petroleu m) were clustered at 80% similarity.   217

6.4.5.2. Qualitative analysis of sequencing data set used for the 
biodiversity st udy of microbial communities of Pb -contaminated crude oil 
degraded soil  
Furthermore, studies based on sequencing analysis of amplified 16S rRNA 
gene were carried out to obtain more details of the microbial community 
structures. For this purpose, 16Sr RNA g enes of communities were sequenced 
using the ion torrent PGM sequencing method. The sequence data obtained 
were analysed using the mothur software to trim sequence data, cluster 
sequence data into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), assign taxonomic 
groups  to OTUs and analyse community diversity (alpha - and beta - diversity 
of communities) to identify the differences in the microbial community 
structures. Due to the high reproducibility of communities identified from the  218  DGGE analysis, representative samples  were used in this analysis. Tagged 
16S rRNA samples from 17 soil samples consisting of metal (Ni, Cd and Pb) 
petroleum degraded soils and controls, which were the petroleum amended, 
and unamended soils made up the pooled clone library used for the ion tor rent 
sequencing. Communities of the Pb -contaminated soils consisted of 
representative samples including PbCl2 amended soils at 150 and 15000 Pb -
concentrations, PbS amended soils at 0.1 150 and 15000 Pb concentrations 
and historically contaminated Pb soil a t high and lower Pb concentrations.  
The ion torrent sequencing recovered high throughput sequence data set of 
492574 sequences. Sequence data from Pb -contaminated communities 
accounted for 114835 sequences, i. e. approximately 23.31% of the sequence 
data f rom the clone library. The sequence reads of PbCl 2 soil communities 
amended with 150 and 15000 ppm Pb were 13409 and 14002 sequences, 
respectively. In addition, 26787 and 19081 sequence reads were obtained from 
PbS soil communities at 150 and 15000 ppm Pb,  respectively. The sequence 
reads obtained from crude oil deranged historically contaminated soils at low 
and high concentrations of Pb were 21537 and 20019, respectively.  
Sequence data were trimmed to recover sequences that had a minimum length 
of 300 bp , a maximum of 500 bp. and homopolymers lower than 7 bp were 
trimmed. This resulted in the omission of ~8.66% of the raw sequence data 
from the Pb -contaminated communities, reducing the sequence recovery to a 
total 104886 sequences.  
For further analysis o n mothur software, sequences were normalised to 8000 
sequences per sample. Also, for QIIME analysis, sequences were normalised 
to 13500 sequences per sample, which  equated to the lowest sequence count 
obtained for the17 samples analysed. Table 6.2 shows an alysis of sampling 
based on the Chao estimate of the number of observed OTUs per sample based 
on 13500 sequences per treatment analysed in QIIME and 8000 sequences per 
treatment for analysis on the mothur platforms.  
6.4.5.3.     OTU -base studies on the in fluence of Cd on the community 
diversity of oil degraded soil microcosms  
OTUs generated using an average neighbour clustering method were analysed 
based on a 97% similarity cutoff. Measures of diversity, which included  219  species richness Simpson’s diversity (λ) and Shannon evenness (EH’), were 
evaluated using the mothur platform using 8000 16S rRNA sequences per 
sample (see table 6.3). Also, diversities of communities were compared 
relative to the oil only amended control and unamended soil control by 
determi ning the Yue and Clayton’s dissimilarity coefficient (θ) (see table 6.4).  
Table 6.2: the analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence sampling for the 
diversity and phylogenetic study of comm unities of Cd -oil amended soils  
 
The species richness was determined from t he number of observed OTUs in 
communities. As has been pointed in chapter 4, 16382 OTUs were observed in 
the whole library analysed. The observed number of species in oil only 
amended and unamended soil communities were 1676 and 2457 OTUs, 
respectively. He nce, 68.21% of the number of species observed in the 
unamended soil was present in the hydrocarbon degrading oil -amended soil 
community. In the PbCl2 amended crude oil degraded communities, the 
number of observed OTUs at 150 and 15000 ppm Pb soils were 204 2 and 
1733 OTUs, respectively. This implies that relative to the soil only control, 
83.11 % and 70.53% of the number of soil species were present in the PbCl2 -
amended soils at 150 and 15000 ppm Pb, respectively. Similarly, in PbS 
amended soils, the number of OTUs observed at 150 and 15000 ppm Pb were 
2184 and 2324 OTUs respectively. These made up 88.89% and 94.58% of the 
unamended soil community. Also, in historically Pb contaminated soils 
amended with crude oil, the number of observed OTUs was 2775 and 226 1 at  220  high and lower Pb, respectively and these are above 100% and 86.08% of the 
number OTUs observed in the unamended soil community.  
 These observations of species richness suggest that hydrocarbon amendment 
reduced the species richness in soil due to the  dominance of enriched 
community of hydrocarbon degrading microbial species in oil only amended 
soils. This conclusion is supported by the appearance of brighter bands in the 
DGGE profiles of oil -amended soils.  Also, Pb contamination, irrespective of 
Pb f orm, Pb concentration and duration of Pb contamination, affected 
dominance of hydrocarbon degraders such that there were slight changes in 
specie richness relative to oil only amended soil communities. Hence, when 
the hydrocarbon degraders are not inhibite d i.e. in the soil amended with oil 
only, great drop in diversity due to the dominance is observed and this effect is 
lessened with metal contamination  
Furthermore, the evenness of community species E H’ was determined.  E H’ 
values are usually between 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect community species 
unevenness ( i. e. a perfect dominance by a species) and 1 a perfect community 
species evenness (a perfectly heterogeneous community). The E H’ of the oil -
amended soil and unamended soil controls are 0.710628 an d 0.874792, 
respectively. To clearly establish the effect of Pb on community species 
evenness, E H’ in Pb contaminated soils were compared with the oil only 
amended soil control. The E H’ of PbCl 2 amended soils were 0.793532 and 
0.858115 at 150 ppm and 15000  Pb concentrations, respectively. Similarly, in 
PbS soils, E H’ was 0.862031 and 0.877259 at 150 ppm and 15000 Pb 
concentrations, respectively. Also, similar E H’ values were obtained in long -
term Pb contaminated soils at high and lower Pb concentrations. He re the E H’ 
values were 0.850906 and 0.860745 at low and high Pb concentrations, 
respectively. These observations imply that relative to oil only amended soils, 
communities of Pb contaminated soils irrespective of Pb form, the 
concentration or the contamina tion duration, have more species evenness, 
suggesting that selective dominance in these communities is less compared to 
oil only amended soil communities. A similar pattern was observed for λ.   221  Using Yue and Clayton’s dissimilarity coefficient, θ (see table  6.4), 
communities were compared relative to oil only -amended soil and unamended 
soil communities. Here, communities are compared to identify similarities in 
diversity. Generally, the values of θ ranged from 0 to 1; with 0 indicating 
perfectly similar comm unity diversity and 1 indicating perfect dissimilar 
community diversity. Analysis indicated that with θ values ranging from 
0.939562 to 0.982061, communities of Pb contaminated soils, irrespective of 
Pb form, concentration or duration of contamination, wer e not similar to oil 
only amended soils. Also, relative to soil only control, no similarities in 
diversities were observed in Pb contaminated soils. Though, the lowest θ 
values of 0.478156 and 0.315519 were obtained in the community of crude oil 
degraded s oil amended with PbCl 2 and PbS at 15000 ppm Pb respectively.  
This indicated that the diversities of these communities were more closely 
related to unamended soil.

  222   6.4.5.4. Community diversity study; Pb effects on the diversity of 
hydrocarbon degraders in oil degraded soil microcosms based on 
phylogenetic analysis  
To further establish the effect of Pb on species dominance in crude oil 
degrading communities, the number of OTUs  that made up 50% of the relative 
abundance of in oil only  amended soil control  was compared with the Pb and 
oil-amended communities. Firstly, 13 OTUs made up 50% of the relative 
abundance of the petroleum degrading microbial community in the oil only 
amen ded control. This is in contrast to 42 OTUs that occurred in soil only 
control. In addition, for the PbCl 2 amended soils, while 32 OTUs made up 
50 % of the relative abundance of species in at 150 ppm Pb amendment, 48 
OTUs occurred at 15000 ppm Pb. Similarl y, for PbS soils 38 OTUs comprised 
50% of the relative abundance of species at 150 ppm Pb amendment and 44 
OTUs occurred with an amendment with 15000 ppm Pb. For the long -term Pb 
contaminated soils, 74 OTUs made up 50% of community relative abundance 
in lo wer Pb soil amended with oil while 58 OTUs occurred in high Pb soil. 
These observations indicated that species enrichment/dominance occurred 
most in the oil only amended soil communities and the presence of Pb 
inhibited selective enrichment of Pb sensitive  petroleu m degraders in the 
communities.  
6.4.5.5. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of microbial communities of 
Pb- contaminated soils amended with crude oil relative to oil only 
amended soils and unamended soils  
Using the Bayesian method of Wang et al, OT Us were assigned to taxonomic 
groups. This classification was accomplished by matching the sequences of 
OTUs against the Silva, RDP and green genes reference files on the mothur 
platform and QIIME. These analyses revealed that the most abundant 10 Phyla 
that dominated the Pb amended oil degrading communities bel onged to 9 
bacterial phyla and one  Archaeal phylum. The bacterial phyla that 
predominated belong to the Proteobacteria , Actinobacteria , Firmicutes , 
Bacteriodetes , Acidobacteria , Chloroflexi , Verrucom icrobia , Planctomycetes  
and Gemmatimonadetes  in order of decreasing relative abundance ( see figure 
6.17). The archaeal phylum was Creanarcheota  (see figure 6. 17).   223  Classification at the genus level revealed that the most predominant OTU in 
Pb and oil -amen ded soils was most closely related sequences belonging to an 
unknown Bacillales  (see figure 6.18).  Two OTUs, related to unknown 
Bacillales  species strains were discriminated based on soil, duration of Pb 
contamination and Pb concentration and were found t o differentially dominate 
in differing ‘treatment’ libraries. While OTU 2 predominated in the short -term 
Pb + oil soils and in the long -term high Pb soils amended with crude oil, OTU 
5 predominated in long -term lower Pb soil amended with crude oil albeit O TU 
2 was found to be present. BLAST and RDP sequence match identified that a 
bacterium Scopulibacillus darangshiensis  originally isolated from rock (Lee 
and Lee 2009) shared 98% similarity, was the closest relative to OTU 5 (see 
figure 6.20). On the other hand, the sequence of OTU 2 was closely related to 
a metal tolerating bacteria, Bacillus circulans  isolated from oil shale and crude 
oil contaminated soil (Yilmaz 2003), which indicated 99% similarity. Other 
close relatives that were between 95 to 97% simi lar to these OTUs, included 
hydrocarbon degraders, such as Geobacillus sp  (Guazzaroni and Corte 2010) 
and Bacillus benzoevorans  (Pichinoty et al. 1984), and metal tolerating 
bacteria, such as Bacillus arsenicoselenates  (Switzer Blum et al. 1998) and 
Lysini bacillus sphaericus  (Peña -Montenegro and Dussán 2013).

Note:  0 <  < 1 where 0= perfect similarity and 1= perfect dissimilarity   224   
Also, extremophiles including; the halophilic Bacillus  chungangensis (Cho et 
al. 2010) , thermophilic Anoxybacillus  amylolyticus (Poli et al. 2006) , 
alkaliniphilic Bacillus  foraminis  (Tiago et al. 2006)  and anaerobic 
Vulcanibacillus mod esticaldus  (L’Haridon et al. 2006)  were closely related to 
the Bacilllales  OTUs. In addition, the OTUs were r elated to bacteria isolated 
from industrial locations including Bacillus gottheili (Seiler et al. 2013)  and 
Geobacillus tepidamans (Schäffer et al. 2004) . 
The relative abundance of OTU 2 was 1.92 % in unamended soils , which 
presumably means that it has a normal function in the pristine soil. The 
amendment of soil with crude oil and PbCl 2 increased the relative abundance 
to 17.30% at 150 ppm Pb and 6.09 % at 15000 ppm. Also, amendment of soil 
with PBS and crude oil increased the relative abundance of OTU 2 to 5.13% at 
150 ppm. However, at 15000  ppm Pb relative abundance of OTU2 was 
slightly decreased to 0.82%. Although OTU 2 was not the most dominant in 
lower Pb crude oil amended soil, the relative abundance was 3.81 %. In the 
high Pb soil amended with crude oil, relative abundance of OTU2 was 4 .03%. 
Interestingly, a different strain of Bacillales  sp. dominated in lower Pb 
contaminated crude oil amended soil communities with a relative abundance 
to 11.58% relative. However, without an analysis of an oil free control for 
these long term contaminat ed soils it is not possible to say from this relative 
abundance data whether these organisms (OTUs 2 and 5) had actually been 
enriched.  
6.4.5.6. Evidence of Pb -influence on selective enrichment of hydrocarbon 
degraders in soil  
In addition to the finding th at Bacillales  strains were specifically enriched in 
Pb contaminated soils amended with crude oil, as was presented in section 
6.4.5.5 above, classification of OTUs identified other evidence that the 
presence of Pb influenced community diversity profile. Co mparison of the 
phylogeny of Pb -soils with oil only amended soils indicated that while strain 
of Rhodococcus  sp. were most enriched in the oil only control it was not in the 
presence of Pb (see figure 6.19). Hence Rhodococcus  strains enriched in the 
oil on ly amended soil might have been vulnerable to Pb contamination. Other  225  hydrocarbon degraders that were enriched in oil only amended soils included 
those with sequences related to Mycobacterium , Comamonadaceae and 
Pseudomonas (see figure 6.19). The relative abundances of these bacterial 
strains in oil amended Pb soils were very low while  the relative abundance of 
Rhodococcus  was 19.90 % in oil only amended soils its relative abundance 
was 0.075 % and 0.23 % in PbCl2 amended soils at 150 and 15000 ppm, 
respect ively. In addition, Rhodococcal  relative abundances were 0.11, 0.04, 
0.11 and 0.10 in PbS soil at 150 ppm Pb, PbS soil at 15000 ppm Pb, high Pb 
soils amended with oil and lower Pb soils amended with oil, respectively. 
Furthermore, the relative abundances o f Mycobacterium , unknown 
Comamonadaceae and Pseudomonas  in oil only amended soils were 8.47 %, 
3.50 % and 2.86 % respectively. In all Pb soils, relative abundance of 
Pseudomonas  ranged from 0.002 % in lower Pb soils to 0.02 % in PbS soil 
amended at 15000 p pm Pb. Also, the relative abundances of Mycobacterium  in 
the Pb containing soil communities ranged from 0.38 % in PbCl 2 amended soil 
at 15000 ppm Pb to 1.46 % in PbS amended soil at 150 ppm Pb. As for the 
unknown Comamonadaceae, in lower Pb soil, relative abundance (the lowest) 
was 0.79  %. In high Pb soil  the relative abundance of unknown 
Comamonadaceae  was 1.83 %  (the highest) . 
Conversely, the strains of Bacillales  enriched in Pb soil petroleum crude 
degraded soil communities were not enriched in oil only amended soil 
community (see figure 6.17). The relative abundances of the Bacillales  strains 
closely related to OTUs 2 and 5 in oil only amended soils were 1.21 % and 
0.24 % respectively. This is very low compared to abundances in Pb soils. 
This implies tha t these strains of Bacillales  can only dominate in the presence 
of Pb.

 0.05   229  6.4.6. Absolute 16S rRNA gene abundances of general bacteria and 
Rhodococcus  in the microbial communities of Pb contaminated crude oil 
degraded soil microcosms  
 Two strains of Bacillales  were identified as the m ost apparently enriched 
taxonomic group in Pb -contaminated microcosms. To provide a clearer 
understanding of the Pb influence on species absolute abundances in the 
enrichment communities, qPCR assays specifically targeting the 16S rRNA 
gene of Bacteria and  Bacillales was carried out to determine the absolute 
abundance of targeted 16S rRNA genes in the communities. Furthermore, the 
abundances of the 16S rRNA genes of treatment soils were compared with the 
controls to determine the absolute influence of Pb on  16S rRNA gene 
abundances in co mmunities.  
6.4.6.1  The influence of short -term Pb -contamination on general soil 
bacterial abundance in communities  
qPCR analysis indicated that the absolute abundance of bacteria in soils 
amended with Pb and crude oil were lo wer relative to oil only control (see 
figure 6.21). ANOVA and Dunnett’s pairwise analysis indicated that the mean 
16S rRNA gene abundance of bacteria in microcosms was significantly lower 
across all treatment microcosms (p=0.0015). The mean 16S rRNA gene 
abundance of bacteria in oil only amended soil was 1.12 x104 gene copies g-1 
dry soil. This is significantly higher than the bacterial abundance in the 
unamended soil by 8.82 X 10 6 ± 2.89 X 10 6 gene copies g-1 dry soil 
indicating that oil amendment signif icantly increased bacterial abundance in 
soil (see figure 6.22). This could be attributed to the enrichment of 
hydrocarbon degraders ( Rhodococcus  species) in the oil -amended soil. 
General, in  PbCl 2-crude oil amended soils, the mean 16S rRNA gene 
abundance of bacteria were lower across the concentrations, relative to oil 
only amended soil. The differences in mean included  1.35 X 10 7 ± 2.89 X 10 6, 
1.45 X 10 7 ± 2.89 X 10 6 and 1.54 X 10 7 ± 2.89 X 10 6 gene copies g-1 dry soil 
at 150 ppm (p=0.0015), 1500 pp m (p=0.0008) and 15000 ppm (p=0.0004), 
respectively. Similarly, the mean 16S rRNA gene abundance s of bacteria in 
PbS-crude oil amended soil s were  lower relative to oil only amended. The 
differences in means included  -1.38 X 10 7 ± 2.89 X 10 6, 1.21 X 10 7 ± 2.89 X 
10 6 and 1.25 X 10 7 ± 2.89 X 10 6 gene copies g-1 dry soil at 150 ppm  230  (p=0.0012), 1500 ppm Pb (p=0.0041) and 15000 ppm (p=0.003), respectively. 
Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene abundances in treatment microcosms were 
lower compared to the unamended  soil. However, Dunnett’s pairwise 
comparison indicated that the mean 16S rRNA gene abundances in treatment 
microcosms were not significantly different relative to unamended soil. These 
observations indicated that the presence of Pb might  have inhibited th e 
enrichment  of some hydrocarbon degraders.  
6.4.6.2  The influence of short -term Pb -contamination on Bacillales  
abundance in soil communities  
 As has been indicated earlier, the most abundant sequence in Pb contaminated 
soil is closely related to strain of Bacillales  (OTU 2) . A qPCR assay carried 
out to determine the absolute abundance of this Bacillales  OTU indicated that 
its 16S rRNA gene abundance was higher relative in the Pb and oil treated 
soils relative to the oil only amended soil. ANOVA indicated th at this was 
significant across all treatments (p<0.0001). Using Dunnett’s analysis, 
treatment soil microcosms were compared with oil only amended control. This 
analysis revealed that the mean Bacillales  16S rRNA gene copies in PbCl 2- 
crude oil amended soil  were higher relative to oil only control by 3.85 X 10 6 ± 
5.79 X 105 gene copies and 2.54 X 10 6 ± 5.79 X 105 gene copies at 150 ppm 
(p<0.0001) and 1500 ppm (p=0.0005), respectively. However, at 15000 ppm, 
there was no significant difference in mean 16S r RNA gene abundance 
relative to oil only control.  
6.4.6.3  Influence of long -term Pb -contamination on bacterial abundance 
in soil communities  
ANOVA revealed that the mean 16S rRNA gene abundance of the bacteria 
varied significantly across soils historically  contaminated with soils with or 
without crude oil (p=0.0003) (see figure 6.23). The mean bacterial 16S rRNA 
abundance in historically Pb contaminated soils at high and low 
concentrations of Pb amended with petroleum crude oil were 7.54 X 10 6 and 
2.24 X 1 0 7 gene copies g-1 soil, respectively. In addition , in historically Pb 
contaminated soils at high and low concentrations of Pb not amended with 
petroleum crude oil, the mean bacterial 16S rRNA abundance were 3.53 X 10 
5 and 1.31  X 10 7 gene copies g-1 soil, respectively. Hence, bacterial abundance  231  in the high Pb soil was greater by 7.19 X 10 6 ± 4.22X 10 6 gene copies g-1 soil 
(p=0.097)  and similarly, the bacterial abundance in lower Pb soil was 
significantly more by 9.27 X 10 6  ± 4.22X 10 6 gene copies o n amendment 
with crude oil (p=0.035)  on amendment crude oil.  
However, comparison of mean bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundances in the 
long-term contaminated Pb soils at high and lower Pb amended with crude oil 
relative to crude oil only control by Dunnett’s analysis indicated bacterial 
abundance there were no significant differences between the treatment soils 
and the control. The mean bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance was lower by 
8.42 X 10 6  ± 5.97 X 10 6 gene copies g-1 soil in high Pb soil amended with 
crude oil (p=0.41). In addition, in lower Pb soil amended with crude oil the 
mean 16S rRNA gene abundance bacterial slightly higher by 6.43 X 10 6  ± 
5.97X 10 6 gene copies g-1 soil (p=0.63) relative to oil only control. This 
implies that long -term Pb conta minated soils broadly sustained similar levels 
of bacterial cells. This may be attributed to the adaptation of bacterial strains 
to Pb presence over a long period.  
To determine the influence of Pb concentrations, the mean bacterial 16S 
rRNA gene abundance s in low and high Pb soils amended with crude oil were 
compared by ANOVA and analysis identified a significant difference between 
treatments. The mean bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundances was lower in high 
Pb soil amended with crude oil by 1.429 X 10 7  ± 4.22 X 10 6 gene copies g-1 
soil (p=0.0012). This implies that despite the duration of contamination, 
higher concentration of Pb reduced bacterial abundance in soils.

 233  6.4.6.4 . Influence  of long -term Pb -contamination on Bacillales  abundance 
in soil communities  
Bacillales  enrichment occurred in historically Pb contaminated soils amended 
with crude oil. qPCR assay specifically designed to target 16S rRNA gene of 
Bacillales  in the soil communities indicated that there the mean 16S rRNA 
gene abun dance of Bacillales  increased on amendment with crude oil (see 
figure 6.23). ANOVA that compared treatments showed that these differences 
in means were significant across treatments (p=0.023). The mean 16S rRNA 
gene of Bacillales  in high and lower Pb soils  amended with crude oil were 
8.70 X 10 4 ± 2.27 X 10 4 and 8.15 X 10 5 ± 1.61 X 105 gene copies g-1 soil, 
respectively. Dunnett’s pairwise comparison indicated that in high Pb soils, 
amendment with oil increased the mean 16S rRNA gene significantly by 8.26  
X 10 4 ± 1.27 X 10 4 gene copies g-1 soil (p<0.001). Conversely, although the 
mean 16S rRNA gene abundance in lower Pb soils amended with crude oil 
increased by 1.22 X 10 5 ± 3.34 X 105 gene copies g-1 soil, this was not 
significant relative to lower Pb s oil not amended with crude oil (p=0.97). 
Relative to the oil only amended soil control, the mean Bacillales  16S rRNA 
gene abundance was significantly higher in high Pb soil amended with crude 
oil by 7.58 X 10 4 ± 1.79 X 104 gene copies g-1 soil (p=0.0011).  Similarly, in 
lower Pb soils amended with crude oil, 16S rRNA gene abundance of 
Bacillales  was significantly higher by 7.17 X 10 5 ± 4.72 X 105 gene g-1 soil 
relative to oil only amended soil (p=0.040).

6.4.7. Numerical relationships between cumulative CO 2, maximal CO 2 
production rates, recovered n -alkanes after degradation period, Bacterial 
16S rRNA Gene abundances and Bacillales  16S rRNA Gene abundances 
of soils co -contaminated with  Pb and crude oil.  
The geochemical and the microbiological data generated from the 
biodegradation of petroleum in long -term and short -term Pb contaminated 
soils have been presented separately in previous sections. In this section, a 
correlation analysis, w hich determined links between the biological and the 
geochemical data, is presented.  Specifically a matrix based correlation 
analyses of cumulative CO 2, maximal CO 2 production rate, total n -alkanes 
recovered after degradation period, the b acterial 16S rRNA  gene abundance 
and the 16S rRNA gene abundance of Bacillales  was carried out. The 
Pearson’s correlations were used to determine the strengt h of the relationships 
between variables (see table 6. 4).  235  6.4.7.1.  Correlation analysis of 16S rRNA gene abundance o f 
bacteria relative Bacillales 16S rRNA gene abundance of soils co -
contaminated with Pb and crude oil  
Interestingly, the Pearson’s correlation  coefficient  (r) between the bacteria and 
the Bacillales  abundances in Pb -crude oil co -contaminated soils was -0.211 
(p=0.29; R2= 0.044) (see table 6.5 and figure 6.24).  This implies that there is 
no significant relationship between the abundances of Bacteria and Bacillales . 
Hence, Bacillales  enrichment in the degrading systems has no effect on the 
bacterial abundanc e. 
6.4.7.2.  Correlation of 16S rRNA gene abundances (Bacteria and 
Bacillales ) relative to maximum cumulative CO 2 during the degradation 
of petroleum hydrocarbons in Pb contaminated soils  
Correlation analysis (see table 6.5) indicated that there was no sign ificant 
relationship between the bacterial abundance and the maximum cumulative 
CO 2 in the Pb -crude oil co -contaminated soils (r=0.29, p=0.14, r2=0.084). 
However, with an R-value  of 0.772 (p<0.0001; r2=0.596), the relationship 
between the Bacillales  abunda nce and the maximum cumulative CO 2 is 
significantly strong and positive (figure 6. 25). Hence, an increase in the 
Bacillales  abundance increased the cumulative CO 2 in soils contaminated with 
a combination of Pb and petroleum crude oil. The cumulative CO 2 as proxy 
for microbial activities in the soils, this interesting observation suggests that 
while the metabolic activities of most bacterial strains in the crude oil - Pb soil 
communities were inhibited, the metabolic activities of the Bacillales  strains 
was not affected significantly. This is a strong evidence of the involvement of 
this organism in carbon turnover and possibly oil degradation hence, the 
identifying the important role of Bacillales  in the in Pb -contaminated 
petroleum oil degrading soil communi ties. 
 
 
 
 
  236  6.4.7.3. Correlation of 16S rRNA gene abundances (Bacteria and 
Bacillales ) with maximal rates of CO 2 production in soil microcosms 
during the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in Pb contaminated 
soils 
The Pearson’s correlation coefficient (s ee table 6.5) between the bacterial 
abundance and the maximal rate of CO 2 production indicated that there was no 
relationship between the bacterial abundance and the CO 2 production rate 
(r=0.381, r2=0.145 p=0.05). However, a positive relationship was obser ved 
between the Bacillales  abundance and the maximal rate of CO 2 production 
(r=0.575, r2=0.331 p=0.002) (see figure 6.26). These observations suggest that 
the enrichment of Bacillales  resulted  from petroleum hydrocarbon 
mineralization in crude oil -Pb co -contaminated soils.

Figures 6.27 and 6.28 show scatter plots of t he total n -alkanes recove red from 
the microcosms after degradation relative to the bacterial and the Bacillales  
16S rRNA gene abundances, respectively. From figure 6.27 and in addition to 
the r -value (see table 6.5), there was no significant relationship between 
bacteria and n -alkane quantity (r=0.050; r2=0.003; p=0.806). Conversely, a 
negative relationship was observed between Bacillales  abundance and total n -
alkane recovered after degradation of petroleum in the Pb contaminated 
petroleum degrading soils (r= -0.551; r2=0.304; p=0.0 03). Hence, increases in 
Bacillales  abundance results in a decrease in the total n -alkanes recovered 
after degradation of petroleum in Pb -crude oil co -contaminated soils. These 
observations suggest that most bacterial strains of microbial communities of 
soils co -contaminated with Pb and petroleum crude oil were inactive due to 
the contamination. However, Bacillales  was actively involved in the 
degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in Pb -crude oil containing soils.

6.5. Discussion  
 
6.5.1 The inhibitory effect of Pb on the microbial activities and 
biode gradation of petrol hydro carbon  
The maximum cumulative CO 2 and the rate of CO 2 production in short term 
Pb contaminated, petroleum degrading soil microcosms indicate that 
petroleum degradation was inhibited in the Pb -crude oil amended soil systems, 
irrespective of Pb form (PbS and  PbCl 2) or concentrations (150, 1500 and 
15000 ppm). Similarly, petroleum crude oil mineralization was inhibited in 
soil historically contaminated with high concentrations of Pb. Since CO 2 
production is a proxy to metabolic activities in the soil, these ob servations 
suggest that the microbial metabolic activities were inhibited in the soil 
systems due to stress imposed by the presence of Pb in the systems, resulting 
in inhibition of important enzyme systems growth and even the death of cells. 
This inhibitio n of growth and possible cell death was corroborated by the 
abundance of Bacillales  (the dominant taxonomic group) 16S rRNA genes in 
the soils, which significantly correlated positively with maximal rates of CO 2 
production and the negative correlation with  total bacteria. This result is 
similar to a previous research by Doelman and Haanstra (1979)  who studied 
the effects of Pb on soil respiration (CO 2 production) and dehydrogenase  241  activities. Based on their studi es, Pb amendment inhibited soil respiration and 
dehydrogenase activities in sandy and clay soils at Pb -concentration between 
375 to 7500 ppm in soils. Also, Khan et al (2010) identified that addition of Pb 
to soil significantly decreased soil enzyme activi ties, microbial biomass 
carbon as well as the number of bacteria and Actinomycetes (the dominant 
taxonomic group). Pb like other heavy metals inhibit microbial activities by 
inducing oxidative stress in microbial cells leading to the loss of cell 
prolifera tion (Cao et al. 2012; Bussche and Soares 2011; Cabiscol et al. 2000) . 
Oxidative stress is due to the production of reactive oxygen species, such as 
hydrog en oxide (H 2O2) and super oxide radicals (O 2-) in cells, which 
consequently impairs cell function and promote cell destruction (Harrison et al. 
2007; Lemire et al. 2013; Cabiscol et al. 2000; Abha and Singh 2012; Nies 
1992; Nies 1999; Sandrin and Maier 2003) .  
Interestingly, the maximum cumulative CO 2 and maximal rates of CO 2 
production in the long -term contaminated low lead soil were not significantly 
different from the crude oil only amended soil control. This could be attributed 
to increased growt h of Pb resistant hydrocarbon degraders in the soil system. 
The abundances of bacterial and Bacillales  (the dominant taxonomic group) 
16S rRNA gene indicated that there was significant increase in both bacteria 
and Bacillales  due to amendment with crude oi l. This observation is in line 
with the data on the maximum cumulative CO 2 and maximal rate of CO 2 
production of lower Pb soil amended with crude oil. Most interestingly, the 
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the strain of Bacillales , which was 
dominant  in the soil system, was different relative to other treatment soils. 
This indicates the possibility of a strain capable of concurrently resisting Pb 
and degrading petroleum hydrocarbons. It will be important to point out here 
that the long -term contaminat ed soils also have a history of polyaromatic 
hydrocarbon contamination, therefore, the possibility that Pb resisting 
hydrocarbon degraders dominating the soil microbial community is high. 
Metal resisting bacteria capable of hydrocarbon degradation have bee n 
reported in past studies (Oriomah and Adelowo 2015; Máthé et al. 2012; Riis 
et al. 2002; Barbieri et al. 1996; Lovley 1995) . The biodiversity of the soil 
community and Pb resistance will be discussed in later sections.   242  Howeve r, in section 6.4.4.1 the total n -alkanes recovered from Pb -containing 
soils irrespective of Pb form, Pb concentration and duration of Pb 
contamination was not significantly different form undegraded crude oil. This 
demonstrated that little if any hydrocar bon degradation occurred in soils. One 
possible reason for non -degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon in Pb soil is the 
loss of bioavailability of hydrocarbons to the members of microbial 
community due to the alteration of hydrocarbon to organo -metallic comp lex. 
Metals such as Pb form complexes with organics, which renders organic 
substrates non -bioavailable to hydrocarbon degraders (Giller et al. 
1998) (Biswas et al. 2015) . Biwas et al 2015 demonstrated that the 
immobilization of heavy metal with Palmitic acid/stearic acid grafted clays 
increased the bioavailability of Poly aromatic hydrocarbon metal -PAH mixed 
contaminated soil.  
5.5.2.  Bioavailability of Pb and uptake by microbes  
As has been acknowledged in earlier chapters that one factor that determines 
the susceptibility of microbes to metals is the bioavailabilit y of the metals to 
the microbes. The sequential extraction indicated that a good percentage of the 
added metals are associated with exchangeable, carbonates, Fe and Mn and 
Organic fractions of the soil. The most mobile metal species are associated 
with the  exchangeable fraction (Tessier et al. 1979) , and these are readily 
available to soil biota (including soil microbes). Unsurprisingly, discrepancies 
were observed in the association of Pb added in different forms with soil 
fractions. While a relatively high concentration of Pb was associated with 
exchangeables, carbonates, Fe and Mn ox ide and organics fractions when 
added as PbCl 2, Pb added as PbS was majorly associated with the organic 
fraction of soil. This could be attributed to the solubility of the Pb forms. 
PbCl 2 (with solubility in water of 10.8 g L-1 at 20 oC and a solubility pr oduct 
of 5.89×10−5 at 25 oC (World Health Organization International Agency for 
Reseach on Cancer 2006 ); Linke 1965 )  is consi dered slightly soluble in water. 
This is  unlike insoluble PbS (World Health Organization International Agency 
for Reseach on Cancer 2006)  (with solubility 6.8 X 10-13 g L-1 and solubility 
product of 9.04 ×10−29 (Linke 1965) ). It has been documented in the past that 
the form of Pb determines the bioavailability of Pb, with the soluble Pb being 
more mobile then insoluble Pb (Canadian Council of Ministers of the  243  Enviro nment 1999) . Also, it appears that when Pb is bound to organic 
compounds (Jarosławiecka and Piotrowska -Seget 2014)  it forms complexes 
that reduce the mobility of Pb in soils. At the same time, the formation of 
complexes also reduces the bioavailability o f soil organic matter to soil biota 
(Giller et al. 19 98). This, therefore, may have explained the observations in 
this study; Pb may have formed metal -organic complexes with the petroleum 
hydrocarbon thereby reducing the bioavailability of the hydrocarbon in 
hydrocarbon degrading microbial communities, henc e, the reduced 
degradation of petroleum obs erved in degrading microcosms.  
Generally, Pb is transported by binding of Pb ion to negatively charged groups 
on bacterial cell surface and progressive metabolism dependant intracellular 
uptake (Levinson et al. 1996) . The mechanism of Pb uptake by microbes are 
through the transport pathways for divalent essential metals such as Fe, Zn and 
Mn (Lemire et al. 2013; Jarosławiecka and Piotrowska -Seget 2014) . This way, 
Pb is transported as a divalent metal or complexed to organic molecules. For 
instance, Pb was transported into cell through CitMHS -family transporters 
which transports essential diva lent trace metals such as Mn, Zn and Fe 
(Lensbouer et al. 2008; Krom et al. 2000; Blancato et al. 2006)  in bacterial cell. 
Also, PbrT transport system, which belongs to the Iron/Lead transport system 
family, encodes the uptake of Pb in bacterial strains, including strains of 
Bacillus  spp (Rensing and Mitra 2007) . 
6.5.3 Microbial community diversity of Pb -crude oil mixed contaminated 
soil 
From this current study, com bined contamination of soil with Pb and crude oil 
reduced the soil microbial diversity in short -term Pb contaminated soils. This 
can be attributed to selective enrichment of species, which are capable of 
growing in the presence of both petroleum hydrocarbo n and Pb 
(notwithstanding the qPCR data on the bacteria that indicates cell death has 
occurred manifesting double effect in operation growth of one group and loss 
of lots of others). The enrichment of metal resisting hydrocarbon utilizers have 
been reporte d in previous studies (Roane and Kellogg 1996; Joynt et al. 2006a; 
Máthé et al. 2012; Thavamani et al. 2012; Oriomah and Adelowo 2015; 
Almeida et  al. 2013; Shi, Becker, et al. 2002) . Interestingly, DGGE and α -
diversity studies revealed that Pb -crude oil mixed contaminated soil  244  communities of short -term Pb contaminated soil communities, irrespective of 
Pb form, have more diverse communities relativ e to oil only amended soil 
communities. More interesting is the fact that soils contaminated at high Pb 
concentration of 15,000 ppm Pb had more diversity than lower Pb 
concentrations of 150 ppm. Further comparison of communities (β -diversity, 
i.e the Yue a nd Clayton dissimilarity coefficient, θ) indicated that relative to 
oil only amended soil, community diversities of Pb soils are highly dissimilar. 
This observation coincided with the MDS plot of the DGGE profile of 
communities in which oil only amended co mmunities were completely 
separated form other communities (see figure 6.18). These implied that the Pb 
contamination of soils (in short period) influenced the selective enrichment of 
species in the Pb containing soil communities. Furthermore, the diversit ies of 
communities of short -term Pb contaminated soils amended with crude oil were 
lower relative to unamended soil community. With lowest θ values, the 
communities of soils contaminated with Pb at 15000 ppm Pb (irrespective of 
form) were more similar to c ommunities of unamended soil compared to other 
soil communities. This observation indicated that Pb concentrations influenced 
the microbial diversities in soils such that lower diversities occurred due to 
selective enrichment of species in communities at l ower concentrations and 
little or no selective enrichment occurred at high concentrations of in short -
term contaminated soils. This observation is similar to studies made by 
Thavamani et al (2012), who identified that the concentrations of both organic 
pollutant and metals differentiated the the soil microbial community structure 
of manufacturing gas plant soil, which was contaminated with Poly aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAH), Pb, Cd and Zn. Their results indicated that diversity was 
more in soils with high con centrations of extractable metals and less in soils 
with high PAH occurrence. Furthermore, observations concurred with reports 
by Joynt et al, (2006), who studied the microbial community structure in soils 
co-contaminated with Pb, Cr and Petroleum hydrocar bon over a long period of 
time. But contrary to these observations, decrease in biodiversity due to high 
Pb- and Cr - presence in hydrocarbon co -contaminated soil community have 
been documented (Shi, Becker, et al. 2002) . Also, the alteration of 
hydrocarbons to a less avail able form as a result of metal -organic complex 
formation, which rendered the organic hydrocarbons less bioavailable, and 
hence less sensitive to communities, (Giller et al. 1998)  could be indicated in  245  the slight similarity between communities contaminated at 15000 ppm Pb and 
unamended soil control as indicat ed by the value of θ.  
6.5.4. Microbial community phylogeny of Pb -crude oil mixed 
contaminated soils  
In the Pb -crude oil amended soil communities, phylogentic studies carried out 
indicated that the most enriched taxonomic group that made up 50% of the 
micro bial relative abundance in petroleum degrading systems with or without 
Pb, long term or short term Pb contaminateion, were members of the 
phylogenetic groups Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, 
Bacteriodetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicr obia Plantomyceytes, , 
and Gemmatimonadetes  in order od descending  relative abundance. In 
previous studies, Proteobacterria  and Firmicutes  were isolated from Pb -Cr-
petroleum mixed contaminated soils (Joynt et al. 2006b) .  At the genus level, 
the most enriched organism was closely related to the order Bacillales, (which 
was unlike the oil only contaminated soil where a strain Rhodococcus  species 
domin ated the microbial populace). In addition, Correlation analysis indicated 
that the abundance of 16S rRNA gene of Bacillales , but not bacteria correlated 
significantly negatively with total n -alkanes recovered from microcosms after 
degradation and significa ntly positively with maximal rate of CO 2 and 
maximum cumulative CO 2.  This implies that n -alkane degradation in Pb -
contaminated soils is primarily as a result of Bacillales  abundance in the 
microbial communities. Most interestingly, two different Bacillale s strains 
were isolated from the lead soils. While one strain was predominant in short -
term Pb contaminated soils and long -term high Pb contaminated soils with 
crude oil, the other was predominant in long -term lower Pb contaminated soils 
with crude oil. Fr om BLAST and RDP analysis, while the former was closely 
related to Scopulibacillus  darangshiensis  (98% similarity) bacteria originally 
isolated from rock (Lee and Lee 2009) ,  the later was closely related to 
Bacillus circulans (99% similarity)  isolated from an oil shale and crude oil 
contaminated soil (Yilmaz 2003)  as a metal t olerating hydrocarbon degrader. 
Other close relatives, which were 95 to 97 % similar were metal tolerating and 
hydrocarbon degrading strains including  Geobacillus spp  (Guazzaroni and 
Corte 2010) , Bacillus benzoevorans  (Pichinoty et al . 1984) , Bacillus  
arsenicoselenates (Switzer Blum et al . 1998) , halophilic Bacillus   246  chungangensis (Cho et al.  2010) , thermophilic Anoxybacillus  amylolyticus 
(Poli et al . 2006) , alkaliniphilic Bacillus  foraminis  (Tiago et al. 2006) ), 
anaerobic Vulcanibacillus modesticaldus  (L’Haridon et al. 2006) , Bacillus 
gottheili (Seiler et al. 2013)  and Geobacillus tepidamans (Schäffer et al. 2004) .  
6.5.5. Pb resistance mechanism s 
Although hydrocarbon degradation in the Pb -petroleum mixed contaminated 
soils studied was significantly lower than in soils not amended with Pb, there 
was the enrichment  of soil microbial community by bacterial strains belonging 
to the taxonomic group, Bacillales.  The abundances  of Bacillales  correlated 
with the measures of petroleum degradation in the soils, including the 
maximum cumulative CO2, the m aximal rate of CO 2 emission and the total  n-
alkanes recovered after degradation. These could be attribut ed to the inherent 
resistance of the Bacillales  strains to Pb . Bacterial Pb resistance is by bacterial 
exclusion of Pb, thereby limiting toxicity of Pb to resistant cells. Mechanisms 
of Pb resistance include adsorption of Pb on cell surface, Pb intracellul ar and 
extracellular sequestration and Efflux mechanisms (Jarosławiecka and 
Piotrowska -Seget 2014; Bruins et al. 2000; Nies 1999; Nies 2003) .  
The adsorption of Pb on cell surfaces immobilizes Pb and limits the mobility 
of Pb across cell envelopes. Usually, Pb binds to functional groups on cell 
surfaces which are usually macromoleculess carbonyl - and hydroxyl groups, 
bioligands such as amino groups a nd phosphates (Jarosławiecka and 
Piotrowska -Seget 2014) .  Bai et al. (2014)  documented the immobilization of 
Pb by adsorption on cell envelop of Bacillus  subtilis  DBM, which reduced the 
transportation of Pb into the cell c ytoplasm and hence, Pb toxicity to cell, in a 
heavy metal contaminated soil. Here, 61.5 % of sequestered Pb was isolated 
from the cell envelope  as entrapped Pb, complexed/ precipitated Pb (with cell 
surface functional groups) or Pb exchanged with ions. Als o, 91.7% of added 
Pb at concentration of 50mg L-1 was reported to bind to ca rbonyl, hydroxyl, 
amide and sulph amide groups of the cell surface of Bacillus  sp ATS -2 (Cabuk 
et al., 2006) . In addition, many microbe s synthesize a sheath of extracellular 
polysaccharides on the cell envelope, which excludes heavy metals from the 
cell (Jarosławiecka and Piotrowska -Seget 2014 and re rences therein) .  The 
process of biosorption, a bioremediation strategy, is based on the capability of 
bacterial strains  to absorb metals  and has contributed to the reduction of metal  247  toxicity in environments.  For instance  Bacillus spp. PPS 03 and Bacill us 
subtilis PPS 04 isolated from sediment core of Paper mill effluent significantly 
reduced concentration of Pb (up to 85 and 86% reduction) in a bioreactor 
within 120 hours (Singh and Chopra 2014) .  
Extracellular and int racellular Pb sequestration is another mechanism by 
which Pb resistant Bacillales  strains observed in this study may have reduced 
Pb toxicity. Pb resistant organisms secret extracellular molecules such as 
phosphates, siderosphores and extracellular polymer ic substances that bind Pb 
resulting in precipitation and limitation of Pb, transport into cells. Also, the 
toxicity of Pb transported into bacterial cell cytoplasm is limited by 
intracellular sequestration by molecules such as phosphates and proteins 
(Jarosławiecka and Piotrowska -Seget 2014) .  For instance Pseudomonas 
marginalis  isolated from metal contaminated soils indicated evidences of 
extracellular sequestration by extracellular polymeric substances (T.M. Roane 
1999) . Also, Levinson et al. (1996)  identified intracellular sequestration of Pb 
which limited t oxicity of Pb for up to 600 fold in resistant strain relative to 
wild strain of Staphylococcus aureus . In addition, sequestration of Pb by 
siderosphore -producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa  strain 4EA have been 
documented in the past (Naik and Dubey 2011) . Furthermore, Smt genes 
(SmtA and SmtB), which encode the biosynthesis of Metallothioneins (MT), 
that primarily sequester Zn, was expressed in Bacillus cereus  due to the 
presence of Pb  (Murthy et al. 2011)  and in addition Homologue of MT protein 
was identified in Pb resisting B. megaterium  (T. M. Roane 1999) . MTs are 
cysteine -rich metal sequestering proteins for intracellular immobilization of 
heavy metals (Blindauer 2011) . In addition, Genes bmtA which encodes 
metal -binding protein, lotheionein, was identifie d in Pb resistant Pseudomonas  
aeruginosa , strain WI -1 (Naik et al. 2012) . 
Another mechanism of Pb resistance by Pb - resisting bacteria involves active 
transportation of Pb out of the cell using the Efflux transport systems, which is 
energy dependant. The efflux transporter that excludes Pb from bacterial cells 
belongs to the protein family P1 -type ATPases. In Cupriavidus 
metallidurans  CH34, gene cluster  pbrTRABCD encode transporter proteins, 
PbrA and PbrB, that were specific for Pb (Hynninen et al. 2009) . The co -
expression of PbrA and PbrB resulted to an efficient limitation of Pb in C.   248  metallidurans  CH34. The proposed mode of action of the proteins is that PbrA 
non-specifically exports Pb, Zn and Cd out of cell cytoplasm and exported Pb 
is sequestered w ith inorganic Phosphate produced by PbrB (Hynninen et al. 
2009) . Also, Plasmid born gene, pbtTFYRABC, encodes proteins, which are 
similar to the products of pbrTRABCD  of C.  metallidurans  CH34, when 
expressed conferred increased resistance of Pb and Cd in A. xylosoxidans  A8 
(Hložková et al. 2013) . 
Conclusions  
The aim of this study was to understand biodegradation of petroleum 
hydrocarbon in long -term and short -term Pb contaminated soils. Results from 
studies indicated that maximal rate of petroleum degradation (determined fr om 
the maximal rate of CO 2 production) was significantly reduced in crude oil 
degrading short -term Pb, contaminated soils, irrespective of Pb form or 
concentration. However, in long -term Pb contaminated soils, while maximal 
rates of petroleum degradation r educed at high -Pb concentration, no effect was 
observed at lower lead concentration. This was attributed to the possibility of 
soil microbial community adaptation to the harsh environment over the long 
duration of Pb -contamination. Also, the n -alkane recov ered from degraded soil 
microcosms indicated that degradation of petroleum in soil microcosms 
contaminated with Pb (short -term or long -term) was not significant, 
irrespective of Pb concentration, form or duration of Pb contamination, 
implying that Pb may h ave impaired biodegradation in the soils.  The 
interesting aspect of this study is that despite this chemical data the other 
analysis (microbiological analysis) support that hydrocarbon degradation still 
occurs to some extent albeit at reduced rates.  
The microbiological diversity studies indicated that amendment of petroleum 
degrading soil with Pb confers differences in the soil microbial community 
diversity. In addition, community diversities of Pb soils differed relative to the 
diversity of unamended soi l control. The further phylogenetic analysis 
identified that Pb inhibited the growth of most hydrocarbon degraders in the 
soil community. While Rhodococcus dominated in metal free crude oil -
amended soils, a strain of Bacillales dominated the soil communiti es 
contaminated with Pb. two Bacillales strains were isolated. While one  249  dominated short -term Pb contaminated soils and long -term Pb soil at high 
concentration, the other was isolated from long -term Pb soil contaminated at a 
lower concentration. While the former was closely related to an isolate from 
rock Scopulibacillus darangshiensis (98%), the later was closely related to 
hydrocarbon degrader Bacillus circulans (99% similarity).  
The clear proliferation of Bacillales in the Pb soils was also indicated in  the 
results obtained from the qPCR assay specifically designed to target the 16S 
rRNA gene of Bacillales of communities. While the abundance of Bacillales 
16S rRNA gene significantly correlated positively with maximum cumulative 
CO 2 and maximal CO 2 produc tion rate, and negatively with the weight of 
recovered n -alkanes, no correlation of parameters was observed with the 16S 
rRNA gene abundance of bacteria.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  250  Chapter 7: Conclusions and recommendations  
The aim of this project was to investigate h eavy metal effects on hydrocarbon 
degradation in complex natural systems (soils) using a microbial ecological 
approach combined with rigorous geochemical analysis of the fate of 
individual hydrocarbon components and metals during the degradation of 
whole o ils. Specifically, the objectives were to determine the effect of the 
different concentrations of the Ni, Cd and Pb on the rate of biodegradation of 
petroleum hydrocarbon in soil for each metal by:  
1. Estimating  biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon thro ugh the 
monitoring of CO 2 production in soil microcosms using GC -MS;  
2. Determining  the differences in the effect on biodegradation of petroleum 
hydrocarbon of different concentrations and forms of added heavy metals 
(organic complexed and inorganic; solu ble or insoluble;  
3. Determining  the fate of added metals in the petroleum hydrocarbon 
contaminated soil system by sequential extraction analysis;  
4. Determining  the extent of degradation of the whole petroleum by 
identifying and quantifying n -alkanes rec overed from microcosms after 
degradation;  
5. Determining  the microbiological community structures and the pattern of 
the microbial population enrichment under different metal type and 
concentration in the complex soil systems during biodegradation using 
molecular microbiological techniques.  
The choice of metals (Ni, Cd, and Pb) reflected metals that might be present in 
co-contaminated sites, which are either essential or non -essential for microbial 
growth and each encompass different concentrations where they are putatively 
toxic.  
7.1. Effects of heavy metals on the petroleum biodegradation in soil 
microcosms  
The study on the effects of Ni on petroleum biodegradation in soils suggests 
that Ni at lower concentrations, has stimulatory or no effect on biode gradation 
of crude oil in soils depending on the chemical form of added Ni. Critically,  251  the stimulatory effect was observed in the Ni -porph amended soils and 
declined with increasing Ni concentration. However, in NiO soils, no effects 
occurred at low conce ntrations and increased concentration of Ni resulted in 
increased inhibition of biodegradation. This is unlike NiCl 2 amended soils 
where Ni effects on biodegradation were neutral irrespective of Ni 
concentration. These results are only explicable when it i s considered that Ni 
can be linked indirectly to the release of metabolic enzymes, which are 
important during biodegradation in aerobic environments ( involved in 
mitigation of oxygen stress) but also may require the Ni to be in complexed 
(chaperoned) form to reduce the inherent toxic effects. Therefore, observations 
made in this study suggest that Ni could be a limiting factor during the 
biodegradation of crude oil  in the soil and that this limitation might not be 
easily remedied simply by adding the metal indiscriminately concerning  form 
and concentration. These results also suggest that providing a suitable supply 
of Ni in the correct form and concentration could have effects on 
biodegradation akin to that observed for N and P addition.  
Unlike Ni, Cd inhi bited oil biodegradation in soils, irrespective of Cd form or 
concentrations and, critically, even at concentrations below those 
recommended by soil guideline values of the UK environmental agency and 
below the intervention value of Dutch list. The inhibit ory effect increased with 
increasing concentration. In addition , the n-alkanes recovered from 
microcosms after the incubation period indicated that very little petroleum was 
degraded in the Cd amended microcosms. This effect is likely due to the 
toxicity o f Cd binding to the active site of enzymes to reduce enzyme potency, 
interacting with enzyme -substrate complex, affecting the synthesis of enzyme 
within cells and inducing the production of ROS thereby imposing oxidative 
stress and consequently leading to the damages of DNA, Lipids and proteins.  
Although the n -alkane recovered from Pb contaminated oil degraded soil 
microcosms indicated that degradation of oil in soil microcosms contaminated 
with Pb (short -term or long -term) was not statistically significan t, irrespective 
of Pb concentration, form or duration of Pb contamination, the hydrocarbon 
degradation rates were significantly reduced in the crude oil degrading short -
term Pb contaminated soils, irrespective of Pb form or concentration. However, 
in long -term Pb contaminated soils, while maximal rates of petroleum  252  degradation were reduced at very high -Pb concentration, no effect was 
observed at the lower lead concentration. It should be noted here that this 
lower Pb concentration was still relatively high in comparison to the pristine 
soil used in the amendment experiments.  This activity in the long -term Pb 
contaminated soils was attributed to the possibility of soil microbial 
community adaptation to the harsh  environment over the long duration of Pb -
conta mination.  
7.2. Effects  of heavy metals on soil microbial community diversity  
There was evidence from community fingerprinting analysis of selective 
enrichment of metal resistant hydrocarbon degraders in microbial 
communities of heavy metal contaminated s oils. Specifically, DGGE analysis 
indicated that enrichment microbial community structures of soils varied 
significantly in relation to Ni -form and concentration. Furthermore analysis of 
community diversity and structure using an OTU -based approach, where 
indices of diversity (specie richness, λ and E H’ and θ) were determined, also 
indicated variation in microbial community diversity. Dominance by 
hydrocarbon degraders prominent at lower concentrations decreased with 
increased Ni concentration. Interestingl y, no change in community diversity 
was observed in NiO contaminated soil at 350 ppm Ni. In Cd contaminated 
soils, disparity in microbial diversity was based on Cd forms. Unlike Ni, 
analysis using OTU -based approach indicated for Cd contaminated soil 
commu nities little dominance by hydrocarbon degraders in the community 
consistent with the reduced levels of hydrocarbon degradation. In Pb 
contaminated soils, DGGE indicated disparity in community structure, which 
was dependent on the length of Pb contaminatio n, Pb concentrations and the 
chemical form of Pb. Further analysis using the OTU -base approach indicated 
slight dominance by a Pb -resistant hydrocarbon degrader. Also, θ -value 
indicated great differences of community structure of Pb -soils relative to oil 
only amended control and unamended soil control.  
7.3. Effect of heavy metals on the phylogeny of microbial community  
Phylogenetic studies indicated that the most dominant organisms in the Ni and 
Cd amended soil community after hydrocarbon degradation enrich ment 
belonged the phylogenetic groups  Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, -, -, - 253  Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteriodetes, Chloroflexi Acidobacteria 
and Crenarcheota in the order of decreasing dominance .  At the genus level, 
the dominant microorganisms we re Rhodococcus , Mycobacterium, 
unclassified Comamonadaceae, Nocardia and Pseudomonas in order of 
decreasing dominance . The most dominant OTU in both Ni and Cd amended 
soils was closely related to a strain of Rhodococcus  (100% similarity). Close 
relatives i ncluded strains of Rhodococcus  that were isolated from hydrocarbon 
contaminated environments ( R. erythropolis  DN1,  Rhodococcus sp . YE1,  
Rhodococcus sp.  Pi71, Rhodococccus sp.  SQ8, R. qingshengii djl -6 and R. 
jialingiae  strain djl -6-2), metal contaminated s oil (uncultured bacterium 
resistant to uranium) and stains Isolated form extreme environments ( R. 
erythropolis  and Rhodococcus sp . Q15 ), However, in Pb amended soils, 
phylogentic studies indicated that the most abundant taxonomic groups were 
Proteobacteria , Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes,  Acidobacteria, 
Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia Plantomyceytes, , Gemmatimonadetes  and 
Crenarcheota in order of decreasing dominance. At the genus level, the two 
dominant OTUs (OTUs 2 and 5), were related to strai ns of Bacillales.  Close 
relatives of OTU2 is Bacillus circulans (99%)  isolated from oil shale and 
crude oil contaminated soil  while OTU5 is closely related to a bacteria 
originally isolated from rock Scopulibacillus  darangshiensis strain (98%).  
7.4. The ef fect of heavy metals on the abundance of bacteria and 
dominant hydrocarbon degraders in the soil communities  
qPCR assays that specifically targeted bacterial 16S rRNA genes was 
designed to quantify the general bacterial abundance in the heavy metal – 
hydro carbon contaminated soils. Also, qPCR that specifically targeted 16S 
rRNA genes of Rhodococcus  and Bacillales  was designed to ascertain the 
abundances of the dominating strains in the soils.  
The abundances of bacterial 16S rRNA was not significantly diffe rent across 
treatments in Ni and Pb contaminated soils. However, in Cd contaminated 
soils, bacterial abundances decreased with increased concentration of Cd. 
Furthermore, the abundance of Rhodococcus  decreased significantly with 
increased concentration of Ni, irrespective of Ni -form. These effects, however, 
were not significant relative to oil only control except at 350 ppm Ni in NiO 
contaminated soils. In Cd contaminated soils, Rhodococcal  enrichment  254  decreased logarithmically with increased metal concentra tions and the 
Rhodococcal  enrichment were significantly lower relative to the oil only 
control at all metal concentrations. In addition , in short -term Pb contaminated 
soils, Bacillales  was enriched significantly in terms of abundance but 
enrichment of Bacillales  decreased with increased Pb concentrations 
irrespective of forms. Similar observations were made in long term Pb 
contaminated soils.  
 
In Ni contaminated soils, the abundance of bacteria and Rhodococcus  
correlated positively and significantly, indic ating that most of the bacterial 
population growths in the system were from the growth of strains of 
Rhodococcus . Furthermore, bacteria as well as Rhodococcus  correlated 
positively with maximum cumulative CO 2 yields produced and maximal rates 
of CO 2 produc tion. However, a negative correlation was observed between the 
total n -alkane and bacterial as well as Rhodococcal  abundances. Likewise, in 
the Cd contaminated soil, again, bacterial abundance correlated positively with 
the abundance of Rhodococcus  which t hemselves correlated positively with 
maximum cumulative CO 2 yields, maximal rates of CO 2 production and 
negatively with total n -alkanes. In the Pb contaminated soils, there was no 
correlation observed between the abundances of bacteria and Bacillales . 
Howe ver, the abundance of Bacillales  correlated positively with the maximum 
cumulative CO 2 and maximal rates of CO 2 production and negatively with the 
total n -alkanes.  
7.5. General synthesis of findings and Recommendations for future 
research  
From this study,  Cd and Pb inhibited biodegradati on of crude oil, which is 
expected given the toxic nature of these metals. However,  this systematic 
study has determined that this inhibition occurred at threshold levels below 
that regarded  as harmful by regulators a findi ng, which has profound 
amplifications for the assessment of the vulnerability of soils with moderate 
to low levels of contamination by such non -essential metals. However, 
despite the observed inhibition the short term additions of these metals also 
indicat ed the rapid adaptive response of a previously uncontaminated soil to  255  the different selective pressures imposed namely that the two metals 
selected for entirely different groups of dominant hydrocarbon degraders 
which were clearly both present in the origi nal microbial community. While 
this adaptability in terms of hydrocarbon degrader selection is clear it was 
also found that within an individual metal gradient further selection did not 
take place whereby higher and lower concentrations selected for differ ent 
populations with putatively higher and lower tolerances to the metal. It was 
interesting to note that the  overall selection pattern i.e.   Bacillales  for Pb 
contamination compared to Rhodococcus  more generally is backed up by 
the longer term Pb soil which were both present in the original microbial 
community. It remains to be determined whether longer -term 
experiments would eventually select for greater metal tolerances.  
In contrast to the studies of the non -essential metals described above a more 
varie d picture was observed in the response of the hydrocarbon degrading 
communities exposed to Ni. For instance,  the unexpected large stimulatory 
effect observed when Ni was added as Ni -Porphyrin is potentially an 
important outcome of this work, which warrants  further study. Namely, the 
possibility of enhancing Ni concentrations and more to the point its 
availability/reduced toxicity to mitigate Ni limitation during biodegradation of 
crude oil . These findings when applied more generally to the role of other 
essential metals in terms of the mechanism by which they might be supplied 
to stimulate degradation opens up a wide field of study.  
Another, related issue that is highlighted in this study is that when 
contamination studies are undertaken  it is not just the bulk 
concentrations of metals that should be considered but the chemical 
associations of these metals. This is strongly indicated especially by the Ni 
studies but to a lesser extent.
