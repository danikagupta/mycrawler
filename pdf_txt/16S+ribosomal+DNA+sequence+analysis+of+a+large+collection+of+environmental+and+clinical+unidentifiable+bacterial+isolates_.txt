ABSTRACT 
 
A total of 1540 bacterial isolates were isolated and screene d for their ability to degrade selected azo dyes. Of these, nine 
isolates were chosen for further studies based on their ability to degrade a wide spectrum of dyes efficiently and rapidly. 
Several microbial consortia were developed and tested for t heir effectiveness. Overall the consortia were able to 
degrade 70 - 100% colour within 72 hours compared to 60 – 97% colour removed by individual isolates. A microbial 
consortium labelled C15 showed good growth in agitation cult ure but the colour removal was best in static culture with 
80 - 100% colour removed in less than 72 hours. Based on t he 16S rRNA sequencing, two of  the bacterial isolates in 
C15 belong to the Chryseobacterium genus while the other one belongs to Flavobacterium genus.

INTRODUCTION 
 Wastewater from textile industries creates a great 
pollution problem due to the dye content. The inefficiency 
in dyeing processes has resulted in 10 – 15% of unused 
dyestuff entering the wastewater directly (Spadarry et al., 
1994). Colour present in dye effluent gives a 
straightforward indication of water being polluted. Major 
classes of synthetic dyes used  include azo, anthraquinone 
and triarylmethane dyes and azo dyes, the largest group 
of all synthetic dyes represent 70 % of all organic dyes 
used by the textile industry (Stolz, 2001). Azo dyes 
constitute a major class of environmental pollutants. 
These compounds are characterised by aromatic rings 
linked by an azo group, N=N. The azo linkage of azo dyes 
may undergo metabolic cleavage resulting in free 
aromatic amines which are recognised as possible human 
carcinogens (Banat et al., 1996). Some of the azo dyes or 
their breakdown products also have a strong toxic and 
mutagenic influence on the living organisms (Pinheiro et 
al., 2004). The discharge of highly coloured dye effluents 
can result in serious environmental damages. Thus, 
colour elimination in wastew ater is today the principal 
problem concerning the textile i ndustries since it is the first 
contaminant recognised in te xtile wastewater and has to 
be removed before discharging into receiving water body.  
The release of azo dyes in to the environment is of 
great concern due to colouration of natural waters and 
also due to toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of 
the dyes and their metabolites.  Considerable attention has 
been given in evaluating the capability of microorganisms 
in decolourising and degrading the azo dyes. Many 
studies on the decolourising c apability of microorganisms especially fungi and bacteria have been reported and 
reviewed (Novotný et al., 2001; Kandelbauer & Guebitz, 
2005). In this study, we chose to isolate some local bacterial strains capable of decolourising selected textile 
dyes in wastewater. To dat e, although  research on 
biodegradation of reactive azo dyes by microbial consortia 
have been established internationally, limited studies on 
the decolourising capability of  bacterial strains isolated 
locally have been reported and their potential in 
wastewater treatment should therefore, be investigated. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
General chemicals 
 All general chemicals used were purchased from Sigma (USA), Merck (Germany) and BDH (England). 
Commercial test kits for the determination of some of the 
environmental parameters were purchased from HACH 
Company (USA). Depending upon the uses, all chemicals 
were of Analar, HPLC or equivalent grade.  
 Commercial industrial dyes  
The dyes used throughout the study were reactive azo 
dyes obtained from the Text ile Technology laboratory, 
Faculty of Applied Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA 
(UiTM), Shah Alam and as listed in Table 1. The reactive 
dyes were chosen since they are the major type of dyes 
that produce the greatest va riety of colours and are 
applicable at a wide range of temperature depending upon 
their chemical structures. The colours of the dyes selected 
as the degrading indicators are the primary colours, 
*Corresponding author  Mal. J. Microbiol. Vol 5(1) 2009, pp. 25-32 
 
 26namely red, blue and yellow. These primary colours are 
normally mixed to produce the other secondary colours.  
In addition violet and brown were included to widen the 
colour spectrum.   Although the dyes have different 
reactive systems, the dyes ar e of the same chemical class 
and function by forming reactive  bonds with the substrates. 
These dyes are commonly used by the local cotton and 
batik industries due to their ease of application and good 
fastness properties.

Decolourisation assays 
 
Decolourisation of the individual dyes was determined at 
their respective maximum absorption wavelength in the 
culture supernatants using a spectrophotometer (Thermo 
Spectronic Spectrophotometer, Genesys 20). A sample of 
culture broth was withdrawn daily and about 1 ml was 
centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 minutes (eppendorf 
Centrifuge 5415), before its opt ical density was measured. 
The optical densities (OD) measured were then converted 
to the dye concentrations using the respective standard 
curves. The efficiency of colour removal was expressed 
as the percentage ratio of the decolourised dye 
concentration to that of init ial one based on the following 
equation 1 (Chen et al., 2003). 
 
Colour removal (%) = Dye (i) – Dye (r)   x  100% (1) 
                                            Dye (i)  where Dye (i) = initial dye concentration (mg/L), Dye (r) = 
residual dye concentration (mg/L).  
 
Media and components 
 Mineral salt media (E1) containing (g/l): Yeast extract (1.0), NaCl (2.0), MgSO
4·7H 2O (0.4), MgCl 2·6H 2O (0.7), 
CaCl 2·2H 2O (0.5), KH 2PO 4 (0.3), K 2HPO 4 (0.3), 
(NH4) 2SO 4 (0.5), and nutrient broth (0.1) with pH adjusted 
to pH 7 using 5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 
hydrochloric acid (HCl). 
 Bacterial isolation and cultivation  
For isolation of bacteria, water, soil and sludge samples 
were collected from various sources including the effluent 
from local textile mill, batik making site, textile laboratory, 
lake, streams, market, and domestic wastewater as 
sources for bacteria. Numerous colonies were obtained 
through serial dilution and/or  streaking method. Isolated 
colonies were then obtained through serial streaking 
method on nutrient agar . Each strain was then inoculated 
into nutrient broth and incubated 24 h at room 
temperature on a platform shaker at 150 rpm (Innova 
2100, New Brunswick, Scientific). A 10% (v/v) inoculum 
was transferred into 250 mL flask containing 100 mL E1 
and incubated similarly.  After 24 h, 10% (v/v) samples 
were sub-cultured into fresh E1 media containing the 
respective dyes and further incubated as described above. 
Strains capable of utilising fresh dyes as a nutrient source 
were plated on E1 plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. 
It was from these plates; isolated colonies were taken and 
repeatedly streaked on nutri ent agar to obtain pure 
cultures. The pure bacterial cu ltures were subsequently 
transferred into nutrient broth.  
 
Screening for bacteria de colourising capability using 
selected azo dyes 
 
The bacterial isolates were cu ltivated in nutrient broth 24 
hours before screening was done in E1 media. For initial 
screening, 0.1% (v/v) aliquot of each isolated strain in 
nutrient broth was inoculated into a 96 well micro titre 
plate, each containing 200 µL individual dye solutions. 
Decolourisation of the dye solution was monitored visually 
after 24 h incubation. Strains that showed high 
decolourising potential were c hosen to be tested further 
using selected dyes incorporated in E1 agar plates.   
In secondary screening using dye incorporated E1 
agar plates, the selected isolates  were first inoculated into 
the nutrient broth for 24 h.  The culture was then lawned 
onto the agar and left for another 24 h before any 
decolourisation zone was noted. Respective dye 
incorporated agars without any inoculums were used as 
controls and the decolourisation were estimated visually 
by comparing the inoculated plates with those of the 
control plates after 24 to 72 h. Final screening using 
selected dyes in E1 liquid media were initially done using 
smaller volume of samples. Each selected strain was 
inoculated into several universal bottles containing 10 mL Mal. J. Microbiol. Vol 5(1) 2009, pp. 25-32 
 
 27nutrient broth and allowed to grow for 24 h. A sample of 
10% (v/v) of the aliquot was then transferred into some 
universal bottles containing 10 mL of E1 media. A final 
concentration of 50 mg/l of each dye was added into each 
bottle and the absorbance at their respective λmax    w as 
taken initially (t o) and after a period of 24 hours (t 24). 
Based on the reduction of the absorbance, the percentage 
of colour removal was estimat ed. Strains that exhibited a 
high potential of decolourising ability were chosen for 
larger scale fermentation. A sa mple of 10% (v/v) of the 24 
h bacterial culture aliquot was added to a 250 mL 
Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of E1 medium and 50 
mg/L dye. The shake cultures (150 rpm at ambient 
temperature) were grown in individual dye components or 
in one effluent mixture of the six dyes with total 
concentration maintained at 50 mg/L. Uninoculated dye 
solutions were used as the control for the dyes. 
Decolourisation of the individual dyes was monitored for 
72 h at their respective ma ximum absorption wavelength 
in culture supernatants us ing a spectrophotometer as 
described earlier.  Development of bacterial consortia  
The isolates for the cons ortium development were 
selected based on three criteria; ability to degrade the 
dyes efficiently (> 60%), rapidly (within 3 days) and also 
ability to degrade a wide variety of dyes. A total of 25 
consortia were developed using combinations of three to 
nine isolates. A loopful of  the selected isolates was 
individually inoculated into NB for 24 h to form a 
consortium. A 10% (v/v) aliquots of the culture mix were 
then transferred into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 
100 ml of E1 medium with 50 mg/L dye and allowed to 
react in agitated and static conditions. The decolourisation 
of the dye was determined as mentioned earlier. The 
procedure was repeated for all the dyes and also for the 
mixture of six dyes at equal concentrations, labelled DM. 
 
Identification of bacteria using 16S rRNA sequencing 
 A 16S rRNA analysis method was used to identify the selected bacterial strains. The nearly full-length 16S RNA 
gene was amplified by PCR with forward primer 27F and 
reversed primal Universal 1492R. Purified PCR products 
were sequenced using the ABI PRISM 3100 DNA 
sequencer and the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle 
Sequencing ready-reaction kit. Primers 27F, 530F, 926F, 
519R, 907R and 1492R were adopted to sequence both 
strands of the 16S RNA gene. The sequences were finally 
assembled to produce the full-length sequence and the 
full-length sequence was compared with all other 
sequences available in the Na tional Center Biotechnology 
Institute (NCBI) Genbank da tabase. The probable identity 
of the bacterial strain was th us determined. Identification 
to the species level was defined as a 16S rDNA sequence 
similarity of ≥ 99% with that of t he prototype strains in 
Genbank; identification at th e genus level was defined as 
a 16S rDNA sequence similarity of ≥ 97% with that of the 
prototype strains in Genbank. A failure to identify was defined as a 16S rDNA sequence similarity score of lower 
than 97% with those deposited in Genbank at the time of 
analysis (March, 2007) (Draincourt et al ., 2000). 
Sequencing of the bacterial strains was conducted by 
Research Biolab Technologies Pte. Ltd. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
Screening for bacteria d ecolourising capability using 
selected azo dyes  
 
A total of 1540 bacterial isolates were screened for 
decolourising capability. From the initial screening on 
micro titre plates, 220 isolates showed decolourising 
potentials and were selected for further screening in agar 
plates. Out of these, 37 isolates showed higher 
decolourising zones on dye incorporated agar plates and 
were chosen for the next step of screening. The 37 
isolates were picked based on the higher decolourising 
capabilities and also their ability to degrade the majority if 
not all six dyes used in the st udy, effectively compared to 
the others. Final screening of the microorganisms in liquid 
media with incorporated dyes resulted in isolation of nine 
bacterial isolates capable of degrading various dyes with 
some isolates exhibiting capability of degrading a wide spectrum of dyes.  These we re tabulated in Table 2 below. 
Tracing back the sources of t he selected isolates revealed 
that all these isolates were isolated from sites 
contaminated with textile relat ed waste. Isolates #84, #85, 
#178 and #188 were obtained from sand and soil near a 
textile printing area; isolate #94 from soil near a cottage 
batik industry while isolate #146 and #156 were isolated 
from wastewater in the textil e dyeing laboratory. The other 
two isolates, namely #166 and #181 were isolated from 
the sludge in the wastewater treatment tank of a textile 
finishing factory. These isolates probably have acquired natural adaptation to survive in the presence of the dyes 
used in the study and in the presence of minimal salt 
media, E1. Chen et al.  (2003) and  Senan and Abraham 
(2004) reported isolation an d screening of microorganisms 
capable of decolourising various azo dyes from sludge 
samples collected from wastewater treatment sites 
contaminated with dyes. 
Isolate #146, #84 and #178 were the most efficient in 
degrading more than one dye with colour removal ranging 
45% – 96% depending on the dyes. RB-160 and RV-5R 
were the easiest dyes to degrade with RR-11 and RBr-18 
being the most difficult. It should be noted that although 
the percentages did not reac h 100%, some of the liquid 
appeared colourless, indicating efficient decolourisation.   
Among the six dyes that were used as the 
decolourising indicators, RB-160 and RV-5R were the 
easiest dyes to degrade with RR-11 and RBr-18 being the 
most difficult.  Some azo dyes are more resistant to 
removal by bacterial cells and this may be attributed to 
their structural differences. Both RB-160 and RV-5R are 
simple monoazo dyes with lower molecular weight in 
comparison to the other dyes thus, these two dyes were 
degraded more readily than others dye, which supports 
the earlier findings by Hu (2001). Zimmermann et al . Mal. J. Microbiol. Vol 5(1) 2009, pp. 25-32 
 
 28(1982), reported similar observation while investigating the 
degradability of different stru ctures of azo dyes using 
purified Orange II azoreductase, an initiating azo dye 
degradation enzyme.

The dye degradability was also found to be 
dependent upon the number and position of hydroxyl and 
sulpho groups in proximity relative to the azo bond; a 
hydroxyl group in position 2 of the naphthol ring induced 
the reaction (Pasti-Grigsby et al., 1992), whereas sulpho 
groups in the ortho and para position hindered the 
reaction (Zimmermann et. al. , 1982). In addition, dyes with 
simple structures and low molecular weight show higher 
rates of decolourisation, whereas decolourisation of highly 
substituted, high molecular weight dyes is more difficult 
(Sani & Banerjee, 1999). However, no clear relationship can be observed between the position of the substituent in 
the aromatic rings from publ ished structure of the dye and 
the degradation efficiency using t he isolates in this study. 
Similar observation was obtained on the investigation of 
the degradability on different azo dye structures by 
Aeromonas hydrophila  (Chen et al. , 2003). The higher 
capabilities of isolates #188, #185, #181, #178, #166, 
#156, #146, #94 and #84 to d egrade all the dyes and the 
dye mixture, DM within 72 h indicate that the isolates 
might be capable of utilising the dyes as their carbon 
source.

Development of bacterial consortia  
Many researchers have menti oned that a higher degree of 
biodegradation and mineralisation can be expected when 
co-metabolic activities with in a microbial community 
complement each other. In such a ‘consortium’, the 
organisms can act synergistically on a variety of dyes and 
dye mixtures. One organism may be able to cause a 
biotransformation of the dye,  which consequently renders 
it more accessible to another organism that otherwise is 
unable to attack the dye (Nigam et al. , 1996). Knapp and 
Newby (1995) reported an example of this approach using 
a mixed culture containing at least four distinct microbial 
strains for the degradati on of the diazo-linked 
chromophore in an industrial effluent.  
In this study, a total of 25 consortia were developed 
using combinations of three to nine isolates. A consortium Mal. J. Microbiol. Vol 5(1) 2009, pp. 25-32 
 
 29based on the nine isolates labelled C1 was first tested for 
its dye degrading ability. However, only three dyes namely, 
RB-160, RR-198 and RV-5R were degraded up to 90% 
while the colour of the other dyes and dye mixture were 
only 40-70% removed.  Further combinations consisted of 
3 – 5 isolates were formed and tried randomly.  Initially, it 
was observed that the presence of isolate #178 in some of 
the selected consortia improv ed the decolourising ability 
of the culture. These were observed in C2, C3 and C7 – 
C9. Based on these observations, isolate #178 was 
chosen as the primary isolate to be included in the next 
consortia formed and tested as listed in Table 3. Table 4 
summarises the results for the tested consortia.   
A combination of isolate #84, #146 and #178, labelled 
C15 was found capable of degrading all the dyes most 
efficiently compared to the other consortia. The 
consortium showed good growth in agitation culture but   
the   colour  removal  was best   in static culture with 75 – 
100% of colour from the 4 dyes and dye mixture were 
removed. When tested in agita ted culture, less than 26% 
colour was removed for all dyes. The results are showed 
in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.  0102030405060708090100

These results indicate that decolourisation is not 
dependent on biomass concentration but is significantly 
correlated with dissolved oxygen levels. A similar 
observation was reported by Moosvi et al.  (2007) where 
within 38 h, maximum decolourisation of 93% was 
observed under static condition compared to only 24% in 
shaking condition. Azo dyes are quite resistant to aerobic 
biological degradation (Zimmermann et al ., 1982); 
nevertheless, decolourisation in aerobic, anaerobic, 
anoxic, or combined treat ment processes have been 
reported (Banat et al ., 1996; Méndez-Paz et al ., 2005; 
Khehra et al ., 2005). In static incubation, transfer of 
oxygen is limited to the br oth surface, and the cell 
cultures will most likely se dimented to the bottom of the 
flasks and become rapidly ox ygen-depleted (Stolz, 2001; 
Chen, 2002). In the absence of oxygen, the azo dye acts 
as sole oxidant or electron acceptor, and its reduction 
rate is then governed exclusively by the rate of formation 
of the electron donor, in this case the reduced azo dyes 
(Wuhrmann et al., 1980). Although the culture was able 
to grow aerobically, anoxic decolourisation of the various 
dyes by the aerobic and facultative microbial consortium 
was best achieved under anaerobic conditions. Similar 
observations have been reported by Nigam et al.  (1996), 
Kapdan et al . (2000), and Khehra et al.  (2005). The 
relatively unspecific bacterial reduction under anaerobic 
conditions with regards to the azo compounds involved is 
of more use for the colour removal in dye wastewater as 
less energy is required for aeration and stirring. 
Decolourisation however, probably will not take place in 
extremely anaerobic conditions (O 2-free nitrogen 
sparging) as pointed out by Chen (2002) which indicates 
that a minimum amount of  oxygen present in the 
facultative anaerobic condition (static condition) was still 
needed for the consortium to maintain their basic cellular 
activity for effective decolourisation.  The performance of consortium C15 exceeds the 
performance of the individual isolates with equal or more 
than 85% decolourisation was observed with RB-160, 
RR-198, RV-5R and RY-84. These results compared 
favourably with previous reported results (Nigam et al. , 
1996) showing 76% dye decolourisation in 3 days by 
mixed microbial consortium supplemented with cheap 
carbon and energy sources. All strains incubated in pure 
culture could reduce the colour  of the dyes but the mixed 
culture did so more rapidly,  suggesting some degree of 
synergism (Abraham et al. , 2003). As with individual 
isolates, RR-11 and RBr-18 remained the most difficult 
dyes to be degraded; nevertheless the percentage of 
decolourisation was slightly higher than those of the 
individual isolates with 53% and 55% colour were 
removed respectively. For t he dye mixture, more than 
70% of colour was removed. The results show that the 
advantages of mixed cultures are apparent and further 
exploitation of the selected  consortium will be beneficial 
in textile wastewater treatment.                       
     
Identification of the bacterial isolates using 16S rRNA 
sequencing 
 
Strain #84 and #146, both ar e gram-negative bacteria, 
rod-shaped, motile, non-spor ulating, and oxidase- and 
catalase-negative. Both isolates produced off-white, 
entire, smooth, glossy and opaque colonies on NA. The 
nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses 
show that strains #84 and #146 belong to 
Chryseobacterium genus (gene sequence similarity value 
97.9%).  Ubiquitous in nature, Chryseobacterium  species 
are found primarily in soil and water. A novel, gram-
negative, rod-shaped bacterial genus Chryseobacterium 
(gene sequence similarity value < 96.9%)  proposed as 
Chryseobacterium daeguense sp. was recently isolated 
by Yoon et al.  (2007) from wastewater of textile dye 
works however, no decolourisation study was reported. 
Another strain identified as C. indologenes SB1 (gene 
sequence similarity value: 95.5%)  was used to form a 
consortium with three other species, and the consortium 
was able to degrade aniline and 4-chloroaniline 
(Radianingtyas et al. , 2003). Although aniline and 4-
chloroaniline are closely related to dyes and dye 
metabolites, direct  utilisation of Chryseobacterium 
species in decolourisation of dyes and textile wastewater 
were not mentioned in the literature.  
Strain #178 is also gram -negative, rod-shaped, 
motile, non-sporulating, and oxidase- and catalase-
negative. The isolate produced golden yellow, entire, 
smooth, glossy and opaque colonies with smaller 
diameter compared to isolates #84 and #146 with 
incubation time of about 3 days at 30 °C. Incubation 
temperature in the region of 20 to 25 °C and incubation 
time of about 4 days for environmental flavobacteria were 
reported and most of thes e strains have been isolated 
from a variety of source s but most commonly from 
freshwater and marine environment (Jooste and Hugo, 
1999).  The 16S rRNA analysis show that strain #178 
belongs to Flavobacterium genus with the closest Mal. J. Microbiol. Vol 5(1) 2009, pp. 25-32 
 
 31relationship to Flavobacterium denitrificans  (gene 
sequence similarity value: 96.7%).    Flavobacterium  sp. 
ATCC 39723 and its ability to degrade azo dye (3,5-
dimethyl-4-hydroxyazobenzene-4’-sulphonic acid) via a 
peroxidase-oxidising activity has been studied by Cao et 
al. (1993) however, the addition of the azo dye into the 
media did not enhance the enzyme production. Some 
Flavobacterium strains capable of degrading 
pentachlorophenol (PCP) were reported by Saber and 
Crawford (1985) however, the literature makes no 
mention of a Flavobacterium sp. which possesses the 
ability to degrade azo dyes.  
The isolation of efficient dye decolourisation bacteria 
from the samples collected from dye contaminated soil 
and wastewater indicates the natural adaptation of these 
microorganisms to survive in the presence of the toxic 
dyes. Overall based on the re sults, the advantages of 
mixed cultures are apparent and further exploitation of 
the selected consortium wi ll be beneficial in textile 
wastewater treatment. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 Screening of the microorganis ms resulted in isolation of 
nine bacterial isolates capable of degrading various azo 
dyes with some isolates exhibiting capability of degrading 
a wide spectrum of dyes. Consortium C15 which 
consisted of three potentia l isolates presumptively 
identified belonging to Chryseobacterium and 
Flavobacterium genus exhibited greatest ability in 
decolourising the dyes an d the dye mixture. The 
performance of consortium C15 also exceeds the 
performance of the individual and the results show that 
the advantages of mixed cu ltures are apparent and 
further exploitation of the se lected consortium will be 
beneficial in textile wastewater treatment.  REFERENCES
