FINDINGS
The Central Valley  Regional  Water Quality Control Board (Central  Valley  Water  Board) 
hereby finds as follows:
Introduction
1. Azteca Milling L.P. dba Valley Grain Products (hereinafter referred to as Azteca or 
Discharger) operate s an industrial food processing plant (referred to as Madera 
Masa Plant or Facility) that produces corn masa . The Facility is at 23865 Avenue 
18 in Madera County . The Facility location is depicted on the Project Location 
Map in Attachment A , and the Facility  and the adjacent properties are depicted 
on the Site Vicinity Map in  Attachment B . 
2. Azteca h as owned and operated the Facility since 1996 . The Facility is currently 
regulated by Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) Orde r 70-208, which was 
originally  issued to Valley Grain Drier, Inc. in June 1970. In 1976, Valley Grain 
Dryer, Inc. merged with Valley Grain Products, Inc. , and i n 1995, Valley Grain 
Products, Inc. merged with ADM Milling, Inc a nd became a California -registered 
limited partnership with Gruma -ADM, Inc.  According to Gruma -ADM’s website, 
Azteca Milling, L.P. is the largest “nixtamal ” corn producer in the United States.
3. The Facility operates about 360 days of the year and processes about 400,000 
pounds of raw corn kernels to produce about 350,000 pounds of corn masa daily. 
Wastewater generated during the masa making process is currently  discharged to 
an existing land application area (LAA -1). There is an abandoned unlined storage  
pond near the center of LAA-1 that reportedly has not been used since Azteca 
purchased the Facility . In 2022, Azteca purchased  about 227 acres of farmland 
curre ntly cropped with almonds to develop as another land application area  
(LAA -2).
4. The Facility , the associated land application areas , and the effluent storage pond  
are within portions of Sections 33 and 34, Township 10 S, Range 17 E, Mount 
Diablo Base and Meridian (MDB&M). The Facility and LAA-1 are within 181.6 -
acre Madera County  Assessor Parcel Number (APN) 029-280-054. LAA -2 and is 
comprised of two Madera Cou nty APNs, 37.7 -acre APN 029-290-011 and  
189.0-acre APN 029-290-014.
5. LAA-1 covers approximately 128 acres  with about 123 acres available for the  
disposal of wastewater. The Facility occupies  the remaining 55 acres  of APN  
 029-280-054. The Facility,  LAA-1, and the individual field numbers for LAA -1 are  
shown on  the Facility Map in Attachment C . The 227 acres that comprise LAA-2 
are shown on the Site Vicinity Map in Attachment B .[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  2

6. Azteca, as owner and operator of the Facility  is responsible for compliance with 
the WDRs  prescribed herein .
7. The following materials are attached and incorporated as part of this Order :
a. Attachment  A — Project Location Map
b. Attachment  B — Site Vicinity  Map 
Attachment  C — Aerial Photo of  Facility and LAA -1
d. Attachment D – Flow Schematic
e. Standard Provisions & Reporting Requirements dated 1 March 1991 
(SPRRs) .
f. Information Sheet .
8. Also attached is Monitoring and Reporting Program Order R5 2023 00XX  
(MRP) , which requires monitoring and reporting for discharges regulated under 
these WDRs.  The Discharger shall comply with the MRP,  and subsequent 
revisions thereto as ordered by the Executive Officer  or adopted by  Central Valley 
Water Board .
9. WDRs are needed for this Facility to ensure the discharge is in compliance with 
current water quality p lans and policies.
Regulatory History  and Background
10. The Facility and its discharge are regulated by WDRs Order 70 -208, which were 
originally issued to Valley Grain Dryer, Inc. on 26 June 1970. WDR s Order 70 -208 
authorizes the discharge of cooking, rinse, and washdown water to land adjacent 
to the Facility . The WDRs describe a design flow of 21,000 gpd  or 0.012 mgd  but 
does not specify  a flow limit nor include an MRP . Therefore, there is limited 
historical monitoring data or information for the Facility .
11. The Facility case file  contains various correspondence and inspection records 
dating back to the 1970s. The file record contains an 11 July 1989 letter from the 
Central  Valley Water Board to Valley Grain Products, Inc., regarding a 10 May 
1989 inspection of the Facility. The letter indicates the system was adequately 
handling the wastewater flows at the time, “ however, the requirements need 
updating to ensure that it ref lects current policies .” Field testing of the waste 
stream recorded pH as high as  11.0 standard pH units (s.u). and a n EC of  
3,800 µmhos/cm.
12. Since 1996, the Facility has been inspected by Central Valley Water Board  staff 
six times  (December 2007, July 2011, June 2012, November 2013, June 2021, 
and October 2022 ). No violations were noted in the inspection reports , but some [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  3 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
of the reports  note the high strength nature  of the wastewater  and the use of 
hydrochloric acid to lower the pH of the effluent prior to discharge to LAA-1. 
Additionally, t he 2021 and 2022 inspections note that LAA -1 was not being 
managed to grow and harvest a crop. 
13. On 6 June 2019, the Central Valley Water Board  Executive Officer  issued Azteca 
a 13260/13267  letter r equiring submittal of a Report of Waste Discharge (RWD). 
On 19 December 2019, Krazan & Associates, Inc. submitted a RWD on behalf of 
Azteca Milling, consist ing of a Form 200 and technical report. 
14. Based on staff’s review of the RWD and the June 2021 inspection, staff met 
(virtually) with the Discharger in August 2021 to discuss various concerns with the 
current operation of the Facility (e.g., lack of storage during precipitation events, 
current ope ration of the land application area, limited monitoring data for the site,  
and current BOD , nutrient,  and salt loading rates to LAA -1). During the meeting, 
Azteca’s representatives expressed a willingness to work towards addressing 
these issues. As follow -up to the meeting,  Central Valley Water Board staff 
requested Azteca to address these permitting issues in a 2 September 2021 
letter.
15. On 1 December 2021, Azteca  provided a response to the August 2021 meeting 
and September 2021 letter. The response  included  additional monitoring data 
recently collected at the Facility ; a November 2021 Initial Wastewater and Nutrient 
Management Plan (2021 NMP)  characterizing  the Facility’s current discharge and 
proposed operation of the existing land application area (LAA -1); and a Tier 1 
Pond Design Report propos ing to expand and install a double liner  at the Facility’s 
existing/abandoned  effluent storage  pond . Both the Wastewater and Nutrient 
Management Plan and the Tier 1 Pond Design Report were  prepared by Provost 
and Pritchard Consulting Group .
16. Furthermore, in the  December 2021 response,  Azteca informed Central Valley 
Water Board staff that it was in the process of acquiring additional land adjacent 
to the current Facility for use as a n additional wastewater land a pplication  
(LAA -2). The land (227 acres as discussed in Finding 3) has been purchased  and 
will be added to Azteca’s  acreage used for the reuse/disposal of wastewater . Prior 
to the discharge of wastewater to LAA-2, the Discharger shall submit an updated 
Wastewater and Nutrient Management Plan as required by  Provision I .6.
Existing Facility  and Discharge
17. Corn  is brought  to the Facility  via rail car and corn kernels  are cooked  in  
10,000 -gallon  cook  tubs,  which  produces  90 to 95 percent  of the process  
wastewater.  The other  five to ten percent  of the discharge  is generated  during  the 
cleaning  of the processing  equipment.  Up to 48 batches  using  about  3,500  gallons[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  4 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
of water  per batch  can be processed  every  24 hours . Calcium hydroxide is added 
to raise the pH of the cooking water  up to around 11.0 s.u.
18. Cooked corn is washed  through a wash auger, conveyed to a dewatering hydro 
sieve, and fed into wet stone grinders via a cross auger to turn the cooked corn 
into masa dough. After the grinder, the mas a dough is flashed dried in suspension 
driers and packaged in 50-pound  bags or 2,200 -pound  totes . A flow schematic is 
presented in Attachment  D.
19. Process w astewater is produced from the cooking, product rinse, and equipment 
cleaning operations . The high pH wastewater (INF-01) is conveyed through a 
series of floor drains to the north side of the F acility to a 5,000 -gallon polyethylene 
storage tank where it processed through a hydro -sieve to remove solids and 
treated with 15 to 31 percent hydrochloric acid to reduce scaling of the  
hydro -sieve and to lower the pH of the wastewater  to between 5.0 and 8.0 s.u. A 
flow meter is used to measure the flow to the 5,000 -gallon storage tank.  
20. Approximately 1.5 tons of wet solids are generated daily, which are sold offsite as 
animal f eed. After screening , a screw press reduces the moisture content of the 
solids to about 70 percent prior to depositing them into bins that are dumped into  
onsite trailers . Solids are not applied to the LAAs.  
21. The 2021 NMP  included  process  wastewater flow data from January 2019 
through October 2021. The average annual effluent flow for the period was just 
over 72 million gallons with total monthly flows ranging from 5.25 million gallons 
(February ) to 6.43 million gallons  (October ). The daily flow ranged from 0.184 to 
0.208 million gallons per day (mgd) , with an average flow of 0.197 mgd.
22. The treated process wastewater  (EFF -01) is then discharged into two  
10,000-gallon polyethylene storage tanks and used to irrigate LAA -1. LAA-1 is 
subdivided into seven  fields  comprising  about 12 8 acres . Currently, Field 7 (see 
Attachment C) contains an existing /abandoned  unlined effluent disposal pond on 
its western half and is fallow on its eastern half due to the area not being 
plumbed/piped for irrigation.  The Discharger has indicated that the majority of 
Field 7 will be removed for the expansion of the existing storage pond as 
discussed previously . Therefore, the 5.2 acres for Field 7 is not included in the 
actual farmabl e acres  for LAA -1. The individual fields for LAA -1 are shown in 
Attachment C and their acreage summarized in Table 1.

23. Order 70 -208 describes a 300 -foot by 500 -foot holding -oxidation -percolation pond 
near the northern boundary but notes the pond was not in use at that time.  A 
December 1985 aerial photo on Google Earth appears to show the pond 
containing water , but it appears dry in the next available phot o in August 1998 , 
(two years after Azteca’s acquisition of the Facility)  and from that point on . As 
previously discussed, a  new lined pond will be constructed in the location of the 
existing /abandoned  unlined pond  that will allow for the even and agronomic 
application of wastewater to the LAA .
24. Available effluent data is limited to six samples  of the untreated process 
wastewate r (INF-01) and treated effluent (EFF -01). A single effluent sample was 
collected in 2019 and  five additional samples were collected during five weekly 
sampling events from 22 September 2021  through 12 October  2021. The 
Discharger noted that  the process was tewater  sample collected on 22 September 
2021 was during a cleaning cycle and as such is not necessarily representative of 
the typical process wastewater  quality. The values were significantly lower and 
were removed as outliers. The results are summarized in Table 2. The average is 
the first value shown with the range shown in parentheses. The value shown for 
pH is the median value.

Calcium mg/L 407 (370 – 480) 304 (230 – 400)
25. The results show considerable variation in concentration s as shown in Table 2. As 
previously noted , high pH cooking water makes up 90 to 95 percent of the 
discharge . The other five to ten percent of the dischar ge is generated during the 
cleaning of the processing equipment. The variability in concentrations is likely  the 
result of collecting grab sample s of the effluent  that don’t represent the blended 
discharge . Upon completion of the proposed lined effluent storage pond  
(17.3 million gallons), effluent samples collected after storage in t he pond will 
provide a more representative sample of the Facility’s effluent . 
26. Wastewater is currently applied to LAA-1 using  sprinkler irrigat ion. The sprinklers 
only have about a 80 to 120-foot diameter and don’t  irrigate all of the available 
acreage  in LAA -1, which results in a significant portion of LAA -1 not being 
irrigated  as shown  on Attachment C . The darker circles represent areas irrigated 
with effluent and the lighter shaded areas indicate areas of non -irrigation.  A new 
or updated irrigation system (discussed starting with Finding  29) is needed  to 
irrigate existing LAA -1 evenly and agronomically.  Currently no crops are grown or 
harvested from LAA -1. Rathe r, natural grasses and weeds grow in the irrigated 
portion of the land , and the weeds and grasses are periodically cut and left on the 
ground . The cuttings are  not removed , which limits the actual amount of nitrogen 
and salt removed by the vegetation grown in the LAAs. Cattle were previously 
allowed to graze o n LAA-1, but that practice has been discontinued  since 
2014/2015.
27. The continued Facility operation and wastewater disposal practices pose a 
significant threat to groundwater quality. Changes to the Facility and disposal 
practices are necessary to ensure the Facility’s operation and discharge is 
protective of underlying groundwater.  
28. The discharge of domestic wastewater is to an onsite septic tank leach field 
system regulated by  Madera County. 
Proposed Changes to the Facility Discharge

29. The 2021 NMP proposes  the Discharger will grow and harvest  a crop  on 123-acre 
LAA-1 and the additi on of a double lined storage pond  (discussed in more detail 
starting with Finding 35). Crops are to be grown during both the summer and 
winter months (double cropped) typically using silage corn during the summer and 
wheat (triticale) during the winter mon ths and all crops will be harvested. Other 
potential crops include sorghum and Sudan grass. A new irrigation system (likely 
pivot or linear sprinkler irrigation)  will be required to irrigate the L AAs 
agronomically.
30. The 2021 NMP also notes about 74 million gallons of supplemental freshwater will 
be required to successfully manage and farm  LAA-1. Irrigation water will be 
supplied from an irrigation well located in the northeast corner of LAA-1. 
31. The 2021 NMP provides loading estimates to the 123-acre LAA-1 using a n 
estimated  flow of 0.21 mgd . Total annual effluent flow was estimated at  
76.6 mill ion gallons , with total monthly flows ranging from 5.25 million gallons to 
6.51 million gallons.  
32. The potential nitrogen, salt, and BOD loadings from Azteca’s discharge to LAA -1 
are presented in the 2021 NMP.  The Discharger used an ammonia volat ilization 
rate of 10 percent (%) and a denitrification rate for nitrate -nitrogen of 5%. As 
shown in Table 3, t he nitrogen balance indicates a net negative balance after crop 
uptake (i.e., the  discharge alone will not provide enough nitrogen for the crop 
needs and add itional fertilize rs is needed) .

33. The 2021 NMP notes that the estimated discharge will add 6,139 pounds of salt 
per year (calculated using FDS) as summarized in Table 4.

34. BOD loading calculations are presented in the 2021 NMP for LAA -1 and indicate 
daily BOD  loading ranged from 15 to 224 lbs/ac/day. Cycle averages are 
estimated and presented in Table 15 of the 2021 NMP and are listed as ranging 
from 4 to 92 lbs/ac/day. The 2021 NMP concludes, “ a broad range of total cycle 
days (irrigation + rest) and depth of effluent applied are possible while maintaining 
appropria te BOD cycle average loading rates.”
2021 Tier 1 Pond Design Report
35. The November 2021 Tier 1 Pond Design Report proposes a double -walled  
high-density polyethylene (HDPE)  pond liner equipped with a leachate  collection 
and removal system and a gas venting system. The liner will consist of a top 
conductive HDPE 60 -mil liner, 175 -mil HDPE ge onet, and a bottom  
non-conductive 60 -mil HDPE.  The lined effluent storage pond is proposed to be 
480 feet long, 260 feet wide, with a depth of 30  feet, and an estimated capacity of 
17.3 million gallons  (with a two -foot freeboa rd). The lined effluent storage pond 
will replace an existing /abandoned  unlined storage pond and assist the 
Discharger in applying effluent agronomically. A Construction Quali ty Assurance 
(CQA) Plan was also provided.  The Discharger has stated that the proposed 
effluent storage pond will be aerated to ensure the pond does not cause nuisance 
conditions.
36. At an effluent flow rate of 0.21 mgd and with a storage capacity of 17 .3 million 
gallons , the pond will provide up to 78 days of effluent storage if empty. The  2021 
NMP includes a water balance  (assuming only discharge to  LAA-1) that indicates 
the maximum volume of water stored for the 100 -year water balance  would be 
17.241 million gallons, just less than the proposed effluent pond’s capacity of 
17.296 million gallons.
Addition of LAA -2 and Proposed  Site Improvements
37. As mentioned  in Finding 3, the Discharger has purchased additional land 
application area (LAA -2) for application of the Facility’s wastewater , identified in  
Attachment B.  The 2021 NMP proposes the Discharger will double crop (grow two 
crops per year) to maximize the potential nutrient/salt uptake of the crops grown in 
the LAAs as shown in the tables below. Silage corn is proposed as the primary 
summer crop while triticale, sorghum, and Sudan grass are proposed as the 
primary winter crops. The loading estimate s presented in Finding s 32, 33, and [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  9

34do not reflect the additional  227 acreage provide d by LAA-2. Adding LAA -2 will 
greatly reduce the loadings as discussed  below . However,  not all of the 227  acres 
at LAA-2 will be available for recycling due to access roads, ponds, etc. The 
following loading rates are estimated using all of LAA -1 (about 123 acres) and all 
227 acres  for comparison purposes .

38. Daily BOD  loading to just LAA-1 was estimated to range from 15 to 224 lbs/ac/day 
and cycle average loading was estimated to range from 4 to 92 lbs/ac/day. Adding 
the 227 -acre LAA-2 reduc es the estimated daily loading from a maximum   
224 lbs/ac/day to 79 lbs/ac/day  and reduces t he estimated cycle average BOD  
loading of 92 lbs/ac/day to approximately 32 lbs/ac/day.
39. During the 14 October 2022 inspection, the Discharger indicated another lined 
pond would likely be required as an equalization pond to adequately irrigate the 
recently  acquired LAA -2. An updated Wastewater Nutrient Management  Plan is 
necessary to demonstrate h ow the 227 -acre area will be utilized to apply  effluent  
at agronomic rates . If the Discharger proposes to construct an additional effluent 
storage pond, the Discharger must submit a Report of Waste Discharge for the 
material change and provide a summary of the construction and land use permits 
that may be  required by the local agency (e.g., Madera County) and whether the 
pond construction triggers the need for a CEQA evaluation.
40. The proposed changes  including  growing/harvesting a crop on LAA -1, expanding 
the land application of process wastewater  to LAA -2, and installation  of a [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  10 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
double -lined pond are improvements to the Facility that will significantly reduce 
the Facility’s threat on degrading underling groundwater. However, these changes 
(besides purchasing the LAA -2) have  not yet be completed . Therefore, this Order  
includes time schedules for the Discharger to implement the proposed changes , 
includ ing: preparation of a Salinity Evaluation and Minimization Plan  (Provision 
I.5), preparation of an updated Wastewater Nutrient Management Plant that 
includes developing LAA-2 for the application of wastewater ( Provision I.6); 
modification of LAA -1 to irrigate and harvest crops (Provision I.7), installation of 
the double -lined storage pond (Provision I.8); preparation of a Pond Operation 
and Maintenance Plan (Provision I.9); and begin irrigating LAA -2 with Facility 
effluent and growing a harvestable crop (Provision I.10). 
Site-Specific Conditions
Topography, Climate , and Land Use
41. The Facility elevation is about 250 feet above mean sea level and the natural land 
surface slopes gradually to the west. The nearest surface water is Dry Creek , 
which borders the northern property line of the Facility. Dry Creek is shown as an 
intermittent  water body that would discharge into the Fresno River about 8 miles 
southwest of the facility. The Fresno River is about 3 miles south of the Facility.
42. According to the Web Soil Survey published by the United States Department of 
Agriculture, Natural Reso urces Conservation Service, soils in LAA -1 consist 
primarily of San Joaquin sandy loam (> 80 percent) with lesser amounts of 
Greenfield coarse sandy loam and Delhi sand. Soils in LAA -2 again consist 
primarily of the San Joaquin sandy loam (about 50 percent ) but include Atwater 
sandy loam, Madera loam, and the Tujunga sandy loam in addition to the 
Greenfield coarse sandy loam . The San Joaquin sandy loam is a Class 4s soil 
that has very severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require 
very careful management, or both. The “s” subclass indicates the soil is limited 
mainly because it is shallow, droughty, or stony. The San Joaquin sandy loam is 
described as moderately well drained with a very low capacity to transmit water.
43. The region is chara cterized by hot dry summers and mild winters. The rainy 
season generally extends from November through March. Occasional rains occur 
during the spring and fall months, but summer months are dry. Average annual 
precipitation is about 12.3 inches. The region  has an annual evapotranspiration of 
53.4 inches with monthly averages ranging from 0.93 inches in December to 8.1 
inches in July (California Irrigation Management Information System [CIMIS ], 
Reference Evapotranspiration Zones, Zone 12).
44. The Facility is wi thin Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood map 
06039C0900E . According to the flood map, the Facility,  LAA-1, and all but a small 
portion at the southeast corner of LAA -2 is within a 100 -year flood zone special [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  11 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
hazards area indicating  the potential flood depth of 1 foot. Process w astewater 
applied via sprinkler irrigation to a crop reduces the potential for pondin g on the 
ground surface and irrigation is not allowed during rainfall events, so impact from 
a flood covering the LAAs would likely be minimal  (once the lined effluent storage 
pond is installed) . The Azteca property (Facility and LAA-1) has an earthen  12 to 
18-inch berm surrounding it and the proposed effluent  storage  pond  will be 
constructed with a four -foot above grade berm that will protect the pond from 
inundation  of flood waters .
45. Land usage surrounding the Facility is a mixture of agricultural, light i ndustrial, 
and rural residential. The Southern Pacific railway and Highway 99 form the 
western property line  of the Facility and LAA -1. The Facility and LAA -1 are 
bordered by agri cultural properties  to the north, east  (by LAA -2), and south . LAA-2 
is bounde d to the north by ag riculture . Rural residences are present to  the south 
and west of LAA -2. According to the California Department of Water Resources 
Land Use Viewer, typical crops grown in the area include deciduous fruits, nuts, 
and grapes.
Groundwater and Subsurface Conditions
46. Source water is supplied to the Facility by  two onsite wells . The depth to water in 
the two onsite source water wells in February 2017 was 234 and 253 feet bgs in 
Wells 1 and 2, respectively. Monitoring results of the two wells from December 
2019  are presented in Table 7.

Regional Groundwater Occurrence and Q uality
47. There are no monitoring wells at the Facility, but WDRs Order 70 -208 noted the 
that the depth to the  unconfined groundwater table in the area ranged between 70 
and 80 feet b gs and that groundwater samples from th e area were collected in 
1965 and 1966 and the EC of the groundwater ranged from 150 to  
462 µmhos/cm.  Depth to groundwater information and groundwater elevation 
maps are available on the  
California Department of Water Resources (DWR) SGMA Data Viewer  
(https://sgma .water.ca.gov/webgis/?appid=SGMADataViewer ). Groundwater 
elevations for s pring 2021 show that the predominant flow direction is to the 
southwest near the location of the Facility. The depth to water was shown at about 
270 feet bgs, with a corresponding groundwater elevation of about 20  feet below 
msl.
48. A review of the California State Water Boards GAMA (GAMA) Groundwater 
Information System shows three domestic wells (AGW080017006, 
AGW080017007 , AGW080018696)  within a half mile of the Facility  and cross -
gradient from the LAAs . Each well has only one sampl ing result analyzed for 
nitrate plus nitrite  collected in 2020 and 2021 and results ranged from 2.9 to  
7.0 mg/L . The GAMA website also shows the presence of three  individual 
municipal well s in the vicinity of the Facility. W ell CA2000682 -003 is onsite nea r 
the southeast corner of the Facility property.  It provides water to the Azteca 
Office, but not to the Facility.  Well CA2000682 -002 is located southeast of the 
intersection of Avenue 18 and Road 24  and is listed as being 295 feet in depth 
with a 125 -foot screened interval.  Well CA2000370 -002 is located about ½ mile 
southwest, downgradient and west of Highway 99. The results for  these three 
wells are shown on Table 8.

Statutory  Authorit y
49. This Order is adopted pursuant to Water Code section 13263, subdivision (a), 
which provides in pertinent part as follows:
The regional board, after any necessary hearing, shall prescribe 
requirements as to the nature of any proposed discharge, existing 
discharge, or material change in an existin g discharge…, with relation to 
the conditions existing in the disposal area or receiving waters upon, or into 
which, the discharge is made or proposed.
50. Compliance with section 13263, subdivision (a), including implementation of 
applicable water quality con trol plans, is discussed in the findings below.
51. The ability to discharge waste is a privilege, not a right, and adoption of this Order 
shall not be construed as creating a vested right to continue discharging waste. 
(Wat. Code, § 13263, subd. (g).)
52. This Or der and its associated Monitoring and Reporting Program (MRP) are also 
adopted pursuant to Water Code section 13267, subdivision (b)(1), which 
provides as follows:
[T]he regional board may require that any person who has discharged, 
discharges, or is suspected of having discharged or discharging, or who 
proposes to discharge waste … shall furnish, under penalty of perjury, 
technical or monitoring program reports which t he regional board requires. 
The burden, including costs, of these reports shall bear a reasonable 
relationship to the need for the report and the benefits to be obtained from 
the reports. In requiring those reports, the regional board shall provide the 
person with a written explanation with regard to the need for the reports 
and shall identify the evidence that supports requiring that person to 
provide the reports.
53. The reports required under this Order, as well as under the separately issued 
MRP, are necess ary to verify and ensure compliance with WDRs. The burden 
associated with such reports is reasonable relative to the need for their 
submission.[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  14

Basin Plan Implementation
54. Pursuant to Water Code section 13263, subdivision (a), WDRs must “implement 
any releva nt water quality control plans… and shall take into consideration the 
beneficial uses to be protected, the water quality objectives reasonably required 
for that purpose, other waste discharges, the need to prevent nuisance, and the 
provisions of Section 13 241.”
Beneficial Uses of Water
55. This Order implements the Central Valley  Water Board’s Water Quality Control 
Plan for the  Sacramento River Basin and the San Joaquin River Basin  (Basin 
Plan), which designates beneficial uses for surface water and groundwa ter and 
establishes water quality objectives (WQOs) necessary to preserve such 
beneficial uses. (See Wat. Code, § 13241 et seq.) .
56. Dry Creek, a tributary to the Fresno River (confluence about eight miles southwest 
of the Facility), borders the Facility to t he north. The existing beneficial uses of 
Fresno River from Hidden Reservoir to the San Joaquin River (per the Basin Plan) 
include irrigation and stock watering (AGR); water contact recreation (REC -1); 
other non -contact water recreation (REC -2); warm fresh water habitat (WARM); 
and wildlife habitat (WILD) Municipal and Domestic Supply (MUN) and Canoe and 
Rafting (REC -1) are listed as potential beneficial uses.
57. The Facility is in the San Joaquin Valley Floor hydrologic unit, Madera 
groundwater hydro logic area. Per the Basin Plan, beneficial uses of underlying 
groundwater at the Facility are municipal and domestic supply (MUN); agricultural 
supply (AGR); industrial service supply (IND); and industrial process supply 
(PRO).
Water Quality Objectives
58. The numeric W QO for bacteria is expressed as the most probable number (MPN) 
of coliform organisms per 100 mL of water. For MUN -designated groundwater, the 
objective is an MPN of 2.2 organisms  over any seven -day period.
59. The narrative WQO for chemical constituents in groundwater generally provides 
that groundwater shall not contain constituents in concentrations adversely 
affecting beneficial uses. For MUN -designated waters, the Basin Plan further 
provides that water, at a  minimum, meet the primary and secondary maximum [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  15 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
contaminant levels (MCLs) specified in California Code of Regulations, title 22 
(Title 22 )1(See Title 22, §§ 64431, 64444, 64449.)
60. The narrative WQO for toxicity provides that groundwater shall be maintained free 
of toxic substances  in concentrations producing detrimental physiological 
responses in human, animal, plant or aquatic life associated with designated 
beneficial uses.
61. To the  extent necessary, narrative WQOs are quantified, on a site -specific basis, 
as numeric limits for constituents with potential to adversely impacted designated 
uses. In determining a site -specific numeric limit, the Central Valley Water Board 
considers rele vant published criteria.
62. In determining a numeric limit for salinity protective of agricultural supply (AGR), 
the Central Valley Water Board is relying on general salt tolerance guidelines, 
which indicate that although yield reductions in nearly all crops are not evident 
when irrigation water has an electrical conductivity (EC) of less than  
700 μmhos/cm, there is an eight - to ten -fold range in salt tolerance for agricultural 
crops. (See, e.g., Ayers & Westcot, Water Quality for Agriculture  [1985 ], § 2.3.) 
For this reason, appropriate salinity values are considered on a case -by-case 
basis. It is possible to achieve full yield potential with groundwater EC up to  
3,000 μmhos/cm, if the proper leaching fraction is provided to maintain soil salinity 
within the tolerance of the crop.
63. The crops listed in Finding  45 is not intended as a definitive inventory of crops that 
are or could be grown in the area where groundwater quality is potentially affected 
by the discharge, but it is representative of current and hist orical agricultural 
practices in the area.
Salt and Nitrate Control Programs
64. The Central Valley Water Board adopted Basin Plan amendments incorporating 
new programs for addressing ongoing salt and nitrate accumulation in the Central 
Valley at its 31 May 20 18 Board Meeting  (Resolution R5 -2018 -0034) . The Basin 
Plan amendments became effective on 17 January 2020  and were revised by the 
Central Valley Water Board  in 2020 with Resolution R5 -2020 -0057  
(https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/board_decisions/adopted_or ders/re
solutions/r5 -2020 -0057_res.pdf ). 
1 Central Valley Water Board may apply limits more stringent than MCLs to ensure that 
waters do not contain chemical constituents i n concentrations that adversely affect 
beneficial uses.[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  16 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
65. For the Salt Control Program, dischargers that are unable to comply with stringent 
salinity requirements will instead need to meet performance -based requirements 
and participate in a basin -wide effort known as the P rioritization and Optimization 
Study (P&O Study) to develop a long -term salinity strategy for the Central Valley. 
The Discharger was issued a Notice to Comply for the Salt Control Program  
(CV-SALTS : ID 2595 ) on 5 January 2021. On 28 June 2021, Azteca  elected to 
participate in the P&O Study and submitted the required fee to comply with the 
Salt Control Program.  To maintain existing salt discharges and minimize salinity 
impacts , this Order  does the following :
a. Requires the Discharger to submit a Salinity  Evaluation and Minimization 
Plan to evaluate methods  to control salinity in its discharge to the extent 
feasible; and
b. Sets a performance -based effluent limitation of 1,900 mg/L for FDS , 
calculated as a n annual  average, on the discharge of wastewater and/or 
wastewater blended with  irrigation water sent to the LAA .
66. For the Nitrate Control Program, dischargers that are unable to comply with 
stringent nitrate requirements will be required to take on alternate compl iance 
approaches that involve providing replacement drinking water to persons whose 
drinking water is affected by nitrates. Dischargers may comply with the new nitrate 
program either individually (Pathway A) or collectively with other dischargers 
(Pathway B). The Facility is within Groundwater Basin 5 -022.06 (San Joaquin 
Valley – Madera), which is a Priority 2 Basin. Notices to Comply for Dischargers in 
Priority 2 Basins will be sent sometime between 2023 and 2024.  
67. As these strategies are implemented, the Central Valley Water Board may find it 
necessary to modify the requirements of these WDRs. As such, this Order may be 
amended or modified to incorporate any newly applicable requirements to ensure 
that the goals of the Salt and Nitrate Control Programs are  met.
Special Considerations for High Strength Waste
68. For the purpose of this Order, “high strength waste” is defined as wastewater that 
contains concentrations of readily degradable organic matter that exceed typical 
concentrations for domestic sewage. Suc h wastes contain greater than 500 mg/L 
BOD . Typical high strength wastewaters include septage, some food processing 
wastes, winery wastes, and rendering plant wastes.
69. Excessive application of high organic strength wastewater to land can create 
objectionabl e odors, soil conditions that are harmful to crops, and degradation of 
underlying groundwater with nitrogen species and metals, as discussed below. 
Such groundwater degradation can be prevented or minimized through 
implementation of best management practic es, which include planting crops to [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  17 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
take up plant nutrients and maximizing oxidation of BOD  to prevent nuisance 
conditions.
70. Regarding BOD , excessive application can deplete oxygen in the vadose zone 
and lead to anoxic conditions. At the ground surface, thi s can result in nuisance 
odors and fly breeding. When insufficient oxygen is present below the ground 
surface, anaerobic decay of the organic matter can create reducing conditions 
that convert metals that are naturally present in the soil as relatively ins oluble 
(oxidized) forms to more soluble reduced forms. This condition can be 
exacerbated by acidic soils and/or acidic wastewater. If the reducing conditions do 
not reverse as the percolate travels down through the vadose zone, these 
dissolved metals (prim arily iron, manganese, and arsenic) can degrade shallow 
groundwater quality. Many aquifers contain enough dissolved oxygen to reverse 
the process, but excessive BOD  loading over extended periods may cause 
beneficial use impacts associated with these metals . 
71. Typically, irrigation with high strength wastewater results in high loading on the 
day of application. It is reasonable to expect some oxidation of BOD  at the ground 
surface, within the evapotranspiration zone and below the root zone within the 
vadose ( unsaturated) zone. The maximum BOD  loading rate that can be applied 
to land without creating nuisance conditions or leaching of metals can vary 
significantly depending on soil conditions and operation of the land application 
system .
72. Pollution Abatement in the Fruit and Vegetable Industry , published by the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency, cites BOD  loading rates in the range of 
36 to 600 lbs/acre -day to prevent nuisance, but indicates the loading rates can be 
even higher under cert ain conditions. The studies that supported this report did 
not evaluate actual or potential groundwater degradation associated with those 
rates. There are few studies that have attempted to determine maximum BOD  
loading rates for protection of groundwater quality. Those that have been done 
are not readily adapted to the varying soil, groundwater, and climate conditions 
that are prevalent throughout the region.
73. The California League of Food Processors’ Manual of Good Practice for Land 
Application of Food Pro cessing/Rinse Water  (Manual of Good Practice) proposes 
risk categories associated with particular BOD  loading rate ranges as follows:
a. Risk Category 1: (less than 50 lbs/ac/day; depth to groundwater greater 
than 5 feet) Indistinguishable from good farming o perations with good 
distribution important.
b. Risk Category 2: (less than 100 lbs/ac/day; depth to groundwater greater 
than 5 feet). Minimal risk of unreasonable groundwater degradation with 
good distribution more important.[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  18 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
c. Risk Category 3: (greater than 10 0 lbs/ac/day; depth to groundwater 
greater than 2 feet) Requires detailed planning and good operation with 
good distribution very important to prevent unreasonable degradation, a s 
well as use of oxygen transfer design equations that consider site -specific 
application cycles and soil properties and special monitoring. 
The Manual of Good Practice recommends allowing a 50 percent increase in the 
BOD  loading rates in cases where sprinkler irrigation is used but  recommends 
that additional safety factors be used  for sites with heavy and/or compacted soils.
74. Although it has not been subject to a scientific peer review process, the Manual of 
Good Practice provides science -based guidance for BOD  loading rates that, if 
fully implemented, are considered a best manageme nt practice to prevent 
groundwater degradation due to reduced metals. 
Antidegradation Policy
75. The Statement of Policy with Respect to Maintaining High Quality Waters in 
California , State Water Board Resolution 68 -16 (Antidegradation Policy), which is 
incor porated as part of the Basin Plan, prohibits the Central Valley Water Board 
from authorizing degradation of “high quality waters” unless it is shown that such 
degradation: (1) will be consistent with the maximum benefit to the people of 
California; ( 2) will not unreasonably affect beneficial uses, or otherwise result in 
water quality less than as prescribed in applicable policies; and (3) is minimized 
through the discharger’s best practicable treatment or control (BPTC).
76. The Facilit y’s discharge is screened  to remove solids and treated with 
hydrochloric acid to lower the pH prior to be ing discharged to land. These WDRs 
require the discharge to apply process wastewater  to crops  at agronomic rates , 
expand the Facility’s land application area , and install a double lined pond for 
effluent storage . The anticipated nitrogen , salt, and BOD  loadings to LAA -1 and 
LAA-2 are presenting in the Findings above .
77. Constituents of concern (COCs) that could have the potential to degrade 
groundwater include  salts (e.g., EC and FDS), nitrates , and organics . Table 9 
summarizes relevant water quality data for these COCs.[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  19

1. The data set for treated effluent is discussed in Finding  24 and summarized in 
Table 2  (one sample from 2019, 5 weekly samples from  22 September 2021  
through 12 October  2021  from the Facility effluent ). 
2. Source water is discussed in Finding 46 and summarized in Table 7 (one 
sample from each of two onsite  wells collected  in December 2019) .
3. Regional groundwater quality from three nearby municipal wells is discussed  
in Findings 47 and 48 and summarized in Table 8.  
4. Results shown  for comparison are nitrate as nitrogen. Total nitrogen results 
were not available for the source water results or from the regional 
groundwater databa se.
a. Salinity . The limited available groundwater data for the site shows 
groundwater is good quality with regards to salinity constituents. The 
Facility’s  process wastewater  salinity concentrations exceed applicable 
water quality objectives  and, therefore, if not properly stored and 
discharged could significantly degrade underlying groundwater for salt. 
These WDRs require the Discharger to install the proposed double -lined 
pond, which will help ensure the storage of the high -strength process  
wastewater  does not degrade groundwater. Furthermore, these WDRs 
require the Discharger to apply process wastewater  to land at agronomic 
rates. The 2021 NMP estimates the discharge at 0.21 mgd will result in an 
estimated  annual salt loading of  6,200 pound s per acre if only discharging 
to LAA -1. However, the Discharger is proposing  (and is required per these 
WDRs)  to add 22 7 additional acres of land application area  (LAA-2). The 
addition of more land for application of process  wastewater will  significantly 
reduce the pounds of salt added per acre (potential annual salt loading of 
around 2,200 lbs/ac re/year ). The Discharger implements best management 
practices to minimize impacts from salts including blending with irrigation 
water . [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  20

Madera County
Furthermore, the Discharger is an active member of the Prioritization and 
Optimization Study for the Salt Control Program. Therefore, t hese WDRs 
include a Performance -Based Effluent Limit of 1,900 mg/L for FDS to 
ensure the Facility’s effluent salinity con centrations do not increase  and 
require t he Discharger to conduct a Salinity Evaluation and Minimization 
Plan to evaluate possible ways to reduce salinity concentrations in the 
Facility’s effluent.  Lastly, the MRP requires the Discharger to regularly 
monit or the Facility’s discharge for salinity constituents as well as calculate 
salinity loading rates on the land application areas.
b. Nitrate.  Based on the limited available groundwater data for the site, 
groundwater is good quality with regard to nitrate. Total nitrogen levels in 
the effluent (based on limited data) appear to range from 42 mg/L  to  
98 mg/L , averaging about  67 mg/L . As discussed in the salinity discussion 
above as well as in previous findings, the Discharger has proposed (and 
required per the se WDRs) to implement various  measures to reduce the 
Facility’s  potential impact on underlying groundwater (i.e., lining the 
Facility’s pond, application of process wastewater  on crops at agronomic 
rates, and adding additional land application area).  Furthermore, the 
Facility is located in a Priority 2 Zone for the Nitrate Control Program and, 
therefore, will receive a Notice to Comply for the Nitrate Control Program 
within the next couple of years.
c. Organics.  The Facility has high -strength process w astewater , with BOD  
concentrations ranging from 620 mg/L to 4,300 mg/L. Storage of  
high-strength process wastewater  to unlined ponds or over application to 
land application areas can result in reducing conditions resulting in certain 
metals (primarily iro n, manganese, and/or arsenic)  converting to more 
soluble reduced forms. To address the se concerns, in part , the WDRs 
require the Discharger to install a double  lined effluent storage pond at the 
location of the Facility’s existing /abandoned  unlined storage  pond and 
comply with a BOD  cycle average loading rate of 100 lbs/acre/day. 
78. This Order requires the  Discharger to implement the following measures, which 
the Central Valley Water Board has determined constitutes BPTC . These 
measures  will minimize the exte nt of water quality degradation resulting from the 
Facility’s continued operation:
a. Comprehensive wastewater/effluent monitoring ;
b. Wastewater storage in properly  lined  effluent storage  pond (s); 
c. Wastewater application  at agronomic rates ;
d. Compliance with a BOD  cycle average loading rate of 100 lbs/acre/year;
e. Solids are screened from the waste stream and sold offsite as cattle feed ;[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  21 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
f. Preparation and i mplementation of a Salinity Evaluation and Minimization 
Plan;
g. Compliance with a Performance -Based Effluent Limit for FDS; and
h. Compliance with the Salt and Nitrate Control Programs.
79. In 2022, Azteca employed about 105 full time and about 20 temporary employees 
at the Facility. The Facility contributes to the economic prosperity of the region by 
providing a necessary service and employment for the local community; by 
providing incomes for numerous aligned businesses; and by providing a tax base 
for local and county governments.
80. Based on the foregoing, the adoption of this Order is consistent with the State 
Water Board’s Antidegradation Policy.
California Environmental Quality Act
81. As previously discussed, these WDRs only authorize flows reflecting existing 
operations at the Facility  and reconstruction of an existing pond to reduce its 
potential impacts on the environment . Therefore, the issuance of this Order, which 
prescribes requi rements and monitoring of waste discharges at an existing facility, 
with negligible or no expansion of its existing use, is exempt from the procedural 
requirements of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources 
Code section 21000 et seq.,  pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 14, 
section 15301 (CEQA Guidelines).
82. To the extent that the construction of any new basins, ponds , surface 
impoundments , and/or use of existing irrigated lands as new LAAs  are authorized 
under this Order, such features involve minor alterations to land, which are 
exempt from CEQA procedural requirements pursuant to California Code of 
Regulations, title 14, section 15304 (CEQA Guidelines).
Other Regulatory Considerations
Water Code Section 13149.2 
83. These WDRs regulate a facility that may impact a disadvantaged community  and 
tribal community  and includes a n alternative compliance path that allows  the 
Discharger  time to come into compliance with a water quality objective   
(i.e., salinity) . The Discharger has selected t he Alternative Salinity Permitting 
Approach for the Salt Control Program, which provide s an alternative approach for 
compliance  with salinity limits  through implementation of specific requirements 
(i.e., support fa cilitation and completion of the Salinity P&O Study). The Central 
Valley Water Board has satisfied the outreach requirements set forth in Water 
Code section 189.7 by conducting outreach in affect ed disadvantaged and tribal [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  22 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
communities  through its notice an d comment procedures . Pursuant to Water 
Code section 13149.2 , and as discussed in the following finding,  the Central 
Valley Water Board reviewed readily available information and information raised 
to the Board by interested persons concerning anticipated water quality impacts in 
disadvantaged or tribal  communities resulting from adoption of th ese WDRs . The 
Board also considered environmental justice concerns within the Board’s authority 
previously  raised by interested persons with regard to those impacts.
84. The Central Valley Water Board anticipates that the issuance of these WDRs will 
result in water quality impacts within the scope of the Board’s authority . 
Specifically, these WDRs authorize the continued discharge of wastewater with 
salinity concentrations above applicable water quality objectives . The Facility’s 
effluent, based on limited date, has an avera ge EC around  1,400 µmhos/cm  and 
TDS average  around  4,200 mg/L . While these concentrations exceed the water 
quality objectives for MUN (municipal and domestic supply), the available 
groundwater data indicates the Facility’s historical discharge has not caus ed a 
significant impact to surrounding communities . Water quality data from nearby  
wells have water quality levels below the applicable drinking water MCLs for 
salinity  (see Groundwater and Subsurface and Antidegradation section s for 
further information) . The Central Valley Water Board has identified the following 
measures available and within the scope of its authority to address the impacts of 
the Facility to the nearby disadvantage communities in Madera County : 1) 
requiring active participation in the P&O Study and compliance with the Salt 
Control Program,  which is intended to identify long -term salinity management and 
control practices and/or technologies,  2) maintain current discharge 
concentrations for salt (e.g., establishing a performance -based salinity limit)  
3) requiring the Discharger to properly  line it’s wastewater effluent storage pond, 
4) requiring application of wastewater to crops at agronomic rates with irrigation of 
supplemental  water as needed, and 5) requiring the preparation and 
implementation of Salinity  Evaluation and Minimization Plan to establish goals for 
potentially reducing salinity concentrations in the Facility’s discharge . All of these 
measures are implemented by these WDRs.
Human Right to Water
85. Pursuant to Water Code section 106.3, subdivision (a), it is “the established policy 
of the state that every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and 
accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary 
purposes.” Although this Or der is not subject to Water Code section 106.3, as it 
does  not revise, adopt, or establish a policy, regulation, or grant criterion (see § 
106.3, subd. (b)), it nevertheless promotes the policy by requiring discharges to 
meet MCLs for drinking water (exclu ding salinity and nitrate), which are designed 
to protect human health and ensure that water is safe for domestic use. For 
salinity and nitrate, this Order requires compliance with the SCP and NCP, 
respectively. Although the Basin Plans’ Exceptions Policy for Salinity, Nitrate, [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  23 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
and/or Boron allows participants in these Programs to obtain limited -term 
exceptions from MCLs for salinity, nitrate, and/or boron, these Programs are 
consistent with the Human Right to Water Policy because their over -arching 
managem ent goals and priorities include short -term provision of safe drinking 
water to impacted users and long -term restoration of impacted groundwater 
basins and sub -basins where reasonable, feasible, and practicable.
Threat -Complexity Rating
86. For the purposes of  California Code of Regulations, title 23 (Title 23), section 
2200, the Facility has a threat -complexity rating of 2 -B.
a. Threat Category “2” reflects waste discharges that can impair receiving 
water beneficial uses, cause short -term water quality objecti ve violations, 
cause secondary drinking water standard violations, and cause nuisances.
b. Complexity Category “B” reflects any discharger not included in Category 
A, with either (1) physical, chemical or biological treatment systems (except 
for septic sys tems with subsurface disposal), or (2) any Class II or Class III 
WMUs.
Title 27 Exemption
87. This Order, which prescribes WDRs for discharges of wastewater, is exempt from 
the prescriptive requirements of California Code of Regulations, title 27 (Title 27), 
section 20005 et seq. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 27, § 20090, subd. (b).) 
Stormwater
88. Storm water at the Facility is routed to and collected in two onsite unlined 
stormwater basin s where it either percolates into the underlying soil  or 
evaporates . Because all stormwater at the Facility is collected and disposed of 
onsite, the Discharger is not re quired to obtain coverage under the Statewide 
General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Industrial Activities , 
State Water Board Order 2014 -0057 -DWQ, NPDES General Permit CAS000001 
(Industrial General Permit)  at this time .

Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
timing of waste discharges authorized herein, without filing a new R WD per Water 
Code section 13260.
91. Failure to file a new RWD before initiating m aterial changes to the character, 
volume or timing of discharges authorized herein, shall constitute an independent 
violation of these WDRs.
92. This Order is also strictly limited in applicability to those individuals and/or entities 
specifically designated h erein as “ Dischargers ,” subject only to the discretion to 
designate or substitute new parties in accordance with this Order.

Information Sheet (incorpor ated herein), was considered by the Central Valley 
Water Board in prescribing the WDRs set forth below.
94. The Discharger , interested agencies and other interested persons were notified of 
the Central Valley Water Board’s intent to prescribe the WDRs in thi s Order, and 
provided an opportunity to submit their written views and recommendations at a 
public hearing. ( See Wat. Code, § 13167.5.)
95. At a public meeting, the Central Valley Water Board heard and considered all 
comments pertaining to the discharges regulated under this Order.
96. The Central Valley Water Board will review and revise the WDRs in this Order as

(monitored at EFF -001 in the MRP) shall not exceed a monthly  average 
daily flow limit of 0.21 million gallons per day ( mgd ). 
D. Effluent Limit ation
1. To comply with the Salt Control Program, the Discharger has selected the 
Alternative Salinity Permitting Approach (i.e., participate in the Prioritization 
and Optimization [P&O] Study). Therefore, as discussed  in Findings  65, 77, 
and 78) , these WDRs establish a  FDS performance -based effluent 
limitation  of 1,900 mg/L  (as an annual average) . As part of the Fourth 
Quarter Monitoring Report required in the MRP, the Discharger shall evaluate 
the Facility’s annual av erage effluent FDS (monitored at EFF -001) to the 
performance -based effluent limitation . If the Facility’s discharge exceeds the 
performance -based effluent limitation , the Discharger shall submit a Salinity 
Report by 1 March  of the year following the exceedance of the performance -[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  26 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant

based effluent limitation . The Salinity Report shall, at a minimum, include the 
following:
a. An evaluation of the Facility’s salinity effluent levels. This evaluation 
should include a discussion of any  changes to the source water for the 
Facility,  any changes to the Facility’s operations or chemical usage , any 
increased conservation efforts implemented within the Facility  (with flow 
data demonstrating decreased flows from the  Facility), and any other 
changes to Facility  that could have contributed to the increased salinity 
concentrations.
b. If additional time is needed to investigate the source(s) of the salinity in 
the Facility’s discharge, the Salinity Report shall include a detailed work 
plan describing what actions the Discharger will conduct (with completion

Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
treatment or stora ge pond shall not be less than 1.0 mg/L for three  
consecutive sampling events. Notwithstanding the DO monitoring  
frequency specified in the monitoring and reporting program, if the DO in  
the pond (s) is below 1.0 mg/L for any single sampling event, the 
Discharger  shall implement daily DO monitoring of that pond until the 
minimum DO  concentration is achieved for at least three consecutive 
days. If the DO in  the pond is below 1.0 mg/L for three consecutive days, 
the Discharger  shall report the findings to the Central Valley Water Board 
in accordance  with Section B.1 of the SPRRs. The written notification shall 
include a  specific plan to resolve the low DO results within 30 days of the 
first date  of violation.
6. All ponds and open containment structures shall be m anaged to prevent 
breeding of mosquitoes. Specifically:
a. An erosion control program shall be implemented to ensure that 
small coves and irregularities are not created around the perimeter 
of the water surface.
b. Weeds shall be minimized through control of water depth, 
harvesting, or herbicides.
c. Dead algae, vegetation, and debris shall not accumulate on the 
water surface.
d. The Discharger shall consult and coordinate with the local Mosquito 
Abatement District to minimize the potential for mosquito bre eding 
as needed to supplement the above measures.
7. The Discharger  shall design, construct, operate, and maintain all ponds 
sufficiently to protect the integrity of containment dams and berms and 
prevent overtopping and/or structural failure.  Unless a  
California -registered civil engineer certifies (based on design, 
construction, and conditions of operation and maintenance) that less 
freeboard is adequate, the operating freeboard in any pond shall never be 
less than two feet (measured verticall y from the lowest possible point of 
overflow) . As a means of management and to discern compliance with this 
requirement, the Discharger shall install and maintain in each pond a 
permanent staff gauge with calibration marks that clearly show the water 
level at design capacity and enable determination of available operational 
freeboard.
8. The Discharger shall monitor residual solids accumulation from the ponds  
annually and shall periodically remove residual solids as necessary to 
maintain adequate storage capac ity.[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  28 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant

berms that separate ponds or control the flow of water within a pond) shall  
be designed and constructed under the supervision of a California  
registered civil engineer .
10. The Dischar ger shall regularly inspect the liner condition of the proposed 
lined effluent storage pond (s). The Discharger shall maintain and repair 
the liner as  necessary to ensure the integrity of the pond liner is 
maintained and  leakage from the liner is minimized
11. Starting 29 April 2025, w astewater treatment, storage, and disposal ponds 
or structures shall have sufficient capacity to accommodate allowable 
wastewater flow, design seasonal precipitation, and ancillary inflow and 
infiltration during the winter while en suring compliance with all 
requirements of this Order. Design seasonal precipitation shall be based 
on total annual precipitation using a return period of 100 years, distributed 
monthly in accordance with historical rainfall patterns . 
12. Starting 29 April 20 25, o n or about 1 October of each year, available 
capacity shall at least equal the volume necessary to comply with 
Discharge Specifications E.7 and E.11.
13. The proposed lined effluent storage  pond will contain a Lea chate  
Collection and Removal System (LCRS) . This order includes an Action 
Leakage Rate (ALR) for the LCRS . If leachate generated in the LCRS 
exceeds the ALR, the Discharger  is required to take actions to inspect and 
repair the primary liner system if applicable . Based on the November 2021 
Tier 1 Pond Design Report , the ALR for the proposed effluent storage 
pond and LRCS is 1.3 gallons per minute.
F. Land Application Area Specifications
For the purposes of this Order, “land application area” or “LAA s” refers to the 
discharge area s described in the Findings (i.e., LAA -1 and LAA -2) and shown in 
Attachment B.  The requirements specified in this section shall be applicable to 
LAA-1 and LAA -2 no later than  29 April 2025  per Provision s I.7 and I.10. 
1. Crops shall be grown on the LAAs . Crops shall be selected based on nutrient 
uptake, consumptive use of water, and irrigation requirements to maximize 
uptake of nutrients.
2. The perimeter of the LAA s shall be graded to prevent ponding along public 
roads or ot her public areas and prevent runoff or overspray onto adjacent 
properties not owned or controlled by the Dischargers.[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  29 
Azteca Milling, L.P.  dba Valley Grain  Products   
Madera Masa Plant   
Madera County
3. Application of waste constituents to the LAA s shall be at reasonable 
agronomic rates to preclude creation of a nuisance or unreasonable 
degradation of groundwater, considering crop, soil, climate and irrigation 
management system. The annual nutritive loading of the LAA s, including 
nutritive value of organic and chemical fertilizers, and the wastewater, shall 
not exceed the annual crop demand . 
4. Hydraulic loading of wastewater and irrigation water shall be at reasonable 
agronomic rates designed to minimize the percolation of wastewater and 
irrigation water below the root zone (i.e., deep percolation).
5. The BOD  loading to the LAA s, calculated as a cycle average as determined 
by the methods described in the attached MRP , shall not exceed  
100 pounds per acre per day.
6. The resulting effect of the discharge on soil pH shall not exceed the buffering 
capacity of the soil profile.
7. Land application of was tewater shall be managed to minimize erosion.
8. The Discharger shall not discharge process wastewater to the LAA when soils 
are saturated (e.g., during or after significant precipitation). 
9. Any irrigation runoff shall be confined to the LAA and shall not enter any 
surface water drainage course or storm water drainage system.
10. The LAA shall be managed to prevent breeding of mosquitos. More 
specifically:
a. All applied irrigation water must infiltrate completely within 48 hours;
b. Ditches not serving as wildlife h abitat shall be maintained free of 
emergent marginal, and floating vegetation; and 
c. Low-pressure and unpressurized pipeline and ditches accessible to 
mosquitos shall not be used to store process wastewater.
11. Irrigation of the LAAs shall occur only when appr opriately trained personnel 
are on duty.
12. LAAs shall be inspected periodically to determine compliance with the 
requirements of this Order. If an inspection reveals noncompliance or threat 
of noncompliance with this Order, the Discharger shall temporarily s top land 
application  use immediately and implement corrective actions to ensure 
compliance with this Order. [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  30

G. Groundwater Limitations
Release of waste constituents from any treatment unit, storage unit,  delivery 
system or disposal location associated wit h the Facility  and process wastewater 
discharge shall not cause or contribute to groundwater containing constituent 
concentrations in excess of the concentrations specified below or in excess of 
background groundwater quality, whichever is greate r:
1. Contain  constituents in concentrations that exceed either the Primary or 
Secondary MCLs established in Title 22 of the California Code of 
Regulations, excluding salinity.
2. Contain taste or odor -producing constituents, toxic substances, or any 
other constituents  in concentrations that cause nuisance or adversely 
affect beneficial uses.
H. Solids Disposal Specifications
1. For the purpose of this Order, residual solids include  the solid, semisolid, 
and liquid organic matter removed during the screening of wastewater .
2. Residual solids shall be removed from screens, and vaults as needed to 
ensure optimal operation, prevent nuisance conditions, and maintain 
adequate storage capa city.
3. Any handling and storage of residual solids shall be temporary and 
controlled and contained in a manner that minimizes leachate formation 
and precludes infiltration of waste constituents into soils in a mass or 
concentration that will violate the groundwater limitations of this Order .
4. If removed from the site, residual solids shall be disposed of in a manner 
approved by the Executive Officer and consistent with Title 27, division 2. 
Removal for reuse as animal feed, biofuel feedstock, or land di sposal at 
facilities (i.e., landfills, composting facilities, soil amendment sites 
operated in accordance with valid waste discharge requirements issued by 
a Regional Water Board) will satisfy this specification.
5. Any proposed change in solids use or dis posal practice shall be reported 
in writing to the Executive Officer at least 90 days in advance of the 
change.
I. Provisions
1. The Discharger shall comply with the separately issued Monitoring and 
Reporting Program (MRP) R5 -2023 -XXXX , and any revisions ther eto as 
ordered by the Executive Officer. The submittal dates of Discharger [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  31

the MRP.
2. A copy of this Order (including Information Sheet, Attachments and 
SPRRs) and the MRP, shall  be kept at the Facility for reference by 
operating personnel. Key operating personnel shall be familiar with their 
contents.
3. The Discharger shall comply with the Basin Plan amendments adopted in 
Resolution R5 -2018 -0034 (and revised per Resolution R5 -2020 -0057 ) 
incorporating new programs (Salt and Nitrate Control Program) for 
addressing ongoing salt and nitrate accumulation in the Central Valley 
developed as part of the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long -Term

MADERA COUNTY
INFORMATION SHEET
BACKGROUND
Azteca Milling L.P. dba Valley Grain Products (hereinafter referred to as Azteca or 
Discharger) is an industrial food processor that produces corn masa at its Mader a Masa 
Processing Plant (Facility). Azteca has owned and operate d the Facility at  
23865 Avenue 18 just northwest of Madera  since 1996.  The Facility is currently set on 
about 182 acres of property , of which , about 123  acres are available for the disposal o f 
processing wastewater with the remaining acres containing the facility buildings, 
associated parking, and two storm water storage  pond s.
The Facility is currently  regulated under Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) Order 
70-208. WDRs Order 70 -208 was issued on  26 June 1970 for a flour mill facility  where 
whole grain corn was cooked, washed, dried, and ground int o corn flour . WDRs Order 
70-208 states the facility  had a 21,000 gallon per day (gpd) design flow but  does not 
specify an effluent flow limit nor include a Monitoring and Reporting Program (MRP). On 
6 June 2019, the Central Valley Water Board issued Azteca Milling a 13267/13260 letter 
requiring submittal of a  Report of Waste Discharge (RWD). On 19 December 2019, 
Krazan & Associates, Inc., submitted a RWD on behalf of Azteca . The RWD consisted 
of a Form 200 and technical report. Additional information to supplement the RWD was 
submitted by Azteca staff at later  dates. 
Central Valley Water  Board staff inspected the Facility on 11 June 2021  resulting in a 
virtually meeting with Azteca staff on 24 August 2021 to discuss concerns regarding the 
lack of storage during precipitation events, current operation of the land application area  
(LAA) , and the limited monitoring  data for the discharge. The Central Valley Water 
Board staff requested Azteca to address these issues in a 2 September 2021 letter.
In December 2021, Azteca provided a November 2021 Initial Wastewater  and Nutrient 
Management Plan (2021 NMP) characterizing the Facility’s current discharge and 
proposed operation of the existing land application area (LAA -1). The 2021 NMP 
included effluent monitoring data collected in September and October 2021 at the 
Facility. Azteca also provided a Tier 1 Pond Design Report that proposed expanding 
and installing a double liner on the Facility’s exiting pond.  Flow from the Facility ranged 
from 159,000 gpd to 210,375 gpd.[Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  ii

INFORMATION SHEET
WASTEWATER GENERATION AND DISPOSAL
Azteca o perates the Facility basically year-round  producing about 197,000 gallons of 
processing wastewater daily from the cooking, product rinse, and cleaning operations  at 
the Facility . All water used for processing and washdown is pH adjusted with 15 -31% 
Hydrochloric Acid and sent through a hydro sieve for removal of corn solids before 
being pumped to a 5,000 -gallon  polyethene tank at the Facility.  Azteca attempt s to keep 
effluent in t he range of 6.5 to 8.5 by testing the effluent weekly and adjusting the 
hydrochloric acid feed as needed.  Approximately 1.5 tons of wet solids are generated 
daily, which are sold offsite as animal feed.
From the temporary storage tank, wastewater is pumped  to two 10,000-gallon 
polyethylene tanks located in the southwest corner of Field 7 of the existing land 
application area designated LAA-1. The pH adjusted process wastewater is then 
applied to the  LAA-1 via sprinkler irrigation . The existing /abandoned  unlined pond is not 
in use  at this time. The Nutrient Management Plan included wastewater flow data from  
January 2019 through October 2021. The 2021 NMP uses monthly averages from data 
ranging from January 2019 through September 2021 to provide  an annual average. The 
average annual effluent flow for the period was just over 72 million gallons with total 
monthly flows ranging from 5.25 million gallons in February to 6.43 million gallons in 
October. The daily flow ranged from 0.184 to 0.208 millio n gallons per day (mgd) with 
an average flow of 0.197 mgd.
Effluent data is limited to six samples  as described in Finding 24 of the WDRs  and 
summarized in Table 2 . The discharge contains elevated levels of salts, primarily EC , 
TDS, and FDS, at concentrati ons above the  applicable water quality objectives and/or 
background groundwater quality. Nitrate as nitrogen averaged 3.0 mg/L and total 
nitrogen averaged 70 mg/L in the discharge. Current application levels are a concern 
and could threaten the underlying groundwater quality. However, the 2021 NMP 
submitted  by Azteca indicates effluent will be  used as a supplemental source of 
irrigation water used to irrigate  the existing 127 -acre LAA-1 and will be blended with 
nearly equal amounts  of freshwater to grow crops such as silage corn and winter wheat . 
This Order requires influent , effluent, soil, and source water monitoring to accurately 
evaluate the salt and organic loadings to the soils of the l and application areas. It 
requires land application area and plant tissue monitoring to ensure application at 
agronomic rates and evaluate the actual nutrient uptake by the proposed crops.  
Azteca received a Salt Control Program Notice to Comply on 5 Janua ry 2021 and has 
selected Path B or the Alternative Option . This Order sets a performance based effluent 
limit (Finding 65) for FDS and requires the preparation of a Salinity Evaluation and 
Minimization Plan  (Provision I.5). The Facility is within Groundwater Basin  5-022.06 
(San Joaquin Valley – Madera), which is a Priority 2 Basin. Notices to Comply for 
Dischargers in Priority 2 Basins will be sent sometime between 2023 and 2024 . [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  iii

SPEC IFICATIONS, AND PR OVISIONS
The Order sets a monthly average maximum daily flow limit of 0.21 mgd for the 
Facility’s  discharge to the land application areas ( LAA-1 and LAA -2). The Order also 
specifies a Performance -Based Effluent Limit o f 1,900 mg/L for FDS (as an annual  
average)  since the Discharg er selected to participate in the Prioritization and 
Optimization Plan for the Salt Control Program.
This Order also contains the following provisions  including:
Provision I.5 requir es the Disc harger to submit a Salinity Evaluation and Minimization 
Plan.
Provision I.6 requir es the Discharger to submit an updated Nutrient Management Plan  
that describes  how process wastewater will be applied to LAA -2 in accordance to th ese 
WDRs.
Provision I.7 requir es the Discharger to commence farming activities on LAA -1 with 
wastewater application at agronomic rates to grow crops such as silage corn, triticale, 
and sor ghum that are harvested.
Provision I.8 requires the Discharger to certify the  double -lined effluent storage pond 
was constructed as proposed and Provision I.9 requires  the Discharger to submit  a 
Pond Operation and Maintenance Plan.
Provision I.10 requiring  the Discharger to certify that LAA -2 is being farmed and 
receiving process wastewater in a manner compliant with these WDRs and per the 
Updated Nutrient Management Plan. 
MONITORING REQUIREMENTS  
Section 13267 of the California Water Code authorizes the Central Valley Water Board 
to require monitoring and technical reports as necessary to investigate the impact of 
waste discharges on waters of the State. Water Code Section 13268 authorizes 
assessme nt of civil administrative liability where appropriate. The Order includes 
influent, effluent, pond, source water supply , land application area, plant tissue , soil, 
supplemental irrigation water, and solids  monitoring requirements. This monitoring is 
neces sary to characterize the discharge and evaluate compliance with the requirements 
and specifications in the Order. [Tentative] Waste Discharge Requirements Order  R5-2023 -00XX  iv

SALT AND NITRATE CONTROL PROGRAMS REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
As part of the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long -Term Sustainability (CV-
SALTS) initiative, the Central Valley Water Board adopted Basin Plan amendments 
(Resolution R5 -2018 -0034) incorporating new programs for addressing ongoing salt and 
nitrate accumulation in the Central Valley at its 31 May 2018 Board Meeting. On  
16 Oct ober 2019, the State Water Resources Control Board adopted Resolution No. 
2019 -0057 approving the Central Valley Water Board Basin Plan amendments and also 
directed the Central Valley Water Board to make targeted revisions to the Basin Plan 
amendments with in one year from the approval of the Basin Plan amendments by the 
Office of Administrative Law. The Office of Administrative Law approved the Basin Plan 
amendments on 15 January 2020 (OAL Matter No. 2019 -1203 -03) and were revised by 
the Central Valley Wate r Board in 2020 with Resolution R5 -2020 -0057  
(https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/board_ decisions/adopted_orders/resoluti
ons/r5 -2020 -0057_res.pdf) .
For the Salt Control Program, a Notice to Comply for the Salt Control Program was 
issued to Azteca Milling, L.P.  (CV-SALTS ID 2595) on 5 January 2021. On  
28 June 2021 , the Discharger submitted the required  fee payment to comply with the 
Salt Control Program by joining the P&O Study.
The Facility is within Groundwater Basin 5 -022.06 (San Joaquin Valley – Madera), 
which is a Priority 2 Basin. Notices to Comply for Dischargers in Priority 2 Basins will be 
sent sometime between 2023 and 2024 .
REOPENER
The conditions of discharge in the Or der were developed based on currently available 
technical information and applicable water quality laws, regulations, policies, and plans, 
and are intended to assure conformance with them. The Order sets limitations based on 
the information provided thus f ar. If applicable laws and regulations change, or once on 
11new information is obtained that will change the overall discharge and its potential to 
impact groundwater, it may be appropriate to reopen the Order.
LEGAL EFFECT OF RESCISSION OF PRIOR WDRS OR O RDERS ON EXISTING 
VIOLATIONS
The Central Valley Water Board’s rescission of prior waste discharge requirements 
and/or monitoring and reporting orders does not extinguish any violations that may have 
occurred during the time those waste discharge requirements or orders were in effect. 
The Central Valley Water Board reserves the right to take enforcement actions to 
address violations of prior prohibitions, limitations, specifications, requirements, or 
provisions of rescinded waste discharge requirem ents or orders as allowed by law.
