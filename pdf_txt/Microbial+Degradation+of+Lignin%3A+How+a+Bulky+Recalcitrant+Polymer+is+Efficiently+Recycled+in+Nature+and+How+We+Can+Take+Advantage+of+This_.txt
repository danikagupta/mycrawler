Summary
Lignin is the second most abundant constituent of the
cell wall of vascular plants, where it protects cellulosetowards hydrolytic attack by saprophytic and patho-genic microbes. Its removal represents a key stepfor carbon recycling in land ecosystems, as well asa central issue for industrial utilization of plantbiomass. The lignin polymer is highly recalcitranttowards chemical and biological degradation dueto its molecular architecture, where different non-phenolic phenylpropanoid units form a complexthree-dimensional network linked by a variety of etherand carbon–carbon bonds. Ligninolytic microbeshave developed a unique strategy to handle lignindegradation based on unspeciﬁc one-electron oxida-tion of the benzenic rings in the different lignin sub-structures by extracellular haemperoxidases actingsynergistically with peroxide-generating oxidases.These peroxidases posses two outstanding charac-teristics: (i) they have unusually high redox potentialdue to haem pocket architecture that enables oxida-tion of non-phenolic aromatic rings, and (ii) theyare able to generate a protein oxidizer by electrontransfer to the haem cofactor forming a catalytictryptophanyl-free radical at the protein surface,where it can interact with the bulky lignin poly-mer. The structure–function information currentlyavailable is being used to build tailor-made peroxi-dases and other oxidoreductases as industrialbiocatalysts.Interest of microbial degradation of lignin
Lignin is a complex aromatic polymer, highly recalcitrant
towards both chemical and biological degradation, char-acteristic of the cell wall of vascular plants (Fig. 1). Around20% of the total carbon ﬁxed by photosynthesis in landecosystems is incorporated into lignin, being the secondmain constituent of plant biomass after cellulose. In addi-tion of providing plant stems the rigidity required forgrowth on land, and waterprooﬁng vascular tissues forsap circulation, a main role of lignin is to protect thecellulose polymer towards hydrolytic attack by mostpathogen and saprophytic organisms. In spite of this,lignin-degrading microbes evolved simultaneously withthe colonization of land by vascular plants in the Palaeo-zoic era, around 400 million year ago (Taylor andOsborne, 1996). Microbial degradation of lignin (Martínezet al. , 2005; Kersten and Cullen, 2007) represents a key
step for closing the carbon cycle, since removal of thelignin barrier enabled the subsequent use of plant carbo-hydrates by other microorganisms.
Lignin removal is also a central aspect in industrial uses
of cellulosic biomass, such as bioethanol production andmanufacture of cellulose-based chemicals and materials,including paper. In the plant cell wall, lignin concentratesin the middle lamella, its most external layer acting as acementing agent between ﬁbres (Fig. 2, top). Cellulosepulp manufacture basically consists in breaking down(chemically or mechanically) the middle lamella in such away that wood ﬁbres are individualized (Sixta, 2006).Although in lower concentration than plant carbohydrates(cellulose and hemicelluloses) lignin is also present insecondary wall, the thicker cell-wall layer, where it is inti-mately associated to carbohydrates preventing their effi-cient hydrolysis in the production of bioethanol (Galbe andZacchi, 2007). In the above industrial applications, bio-technology based on lignin-degrading microbes and theirenzymes can contribute to more efficient and environ-mentally sound use of renewable lignocellulosic feed-stocks for sustainable production of materials, chemicals,biofuels and energy.

Although lignin precursors, i.e. the three classical
p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols and their recently reported
acylated forms (Ralph et al. , 2004; Martínez et al. , 2008),
are phenolic compounds (Fig. 1, top), the lignin polymerformed from these monolignols is basically non-phenolic(Fig. 1, bottom). In the last step of lignin biosynthesis, plantperoxidases (and maybe also laccases) oxidize monoli-gnol to their phenoxy radicals (Higuchi, 1997). Chemicalcoupling between the resonant forms of these radicalsresults in a variety of phenolic dimeric structures (dilignols)that can be enzymatically oxidized again, the processﬁnally leading to lignin polymer formation. However, due topredominance of the corresponding radical forms andhigher stability of the coupling products, ether linkagesbetween the phenolic position (C
4) and a side-chain (or
aromatic ring) carbon of the p-hydroxyphenylpropenoid
precursors (substructures A, B and D) are strongly pre-dominant in the growing polymer. Due to the high fre-quency of these ether linkages, the aromatic lignin unitsare basically non-phenolic. Moreover, in contrast tocellulose formed by linear (anhydroglucose) chains andhemicelluloses that include short branches on a mainpolysaccharidic backbone, the lignin polymerizationmechanism (based on resonant radical coupling) results ina complex three-dimensional network (Fig. 1, bottom) dueto both chain branching and inter/intra-chain couplingduring polymerization, as shown in updated lignin models(Gellerstedt and Henriksson, 2008).
Due to its non-phenolic aromatic nature, lignin units
cannot be oxidized by low-redox-potential oxidoreduc-tases, such as the plant peroxidases initiating the poly-merization process. In fact, only a small group of highlyspecialized peroxidases secreted by ligninolytic fungiare able to degrade model compounds representingthe main lignin substructures. The bulky nature of theheterogeneous lignin polymer forming a complex three-dimensional network represents an additional limitationfor biodegradation since the enzyme accessibility isstrongly reduced. To overcome this difficulty, two mainstrategies have been developed by ligninolytic organismsbased on: (i) presence of catalytic residues widelyexposed at the surface of ligninolytic peroxidases, and (ii)use of redox mediators participating in the enzymaticattack.
Ligninolytic organisms and enzymes
The ﬁrst lignin structural models were available in the
1970s (Nimz, 1974; Adler, 1977) and new substructuresare still being identiﬁed using modern analytical tech-niques (Karhunen et al. , 1995; Zhang et al. , 2006; del Río
et al. , 2007). Before this date no contrasted information
on lignin structure was available, preventing studies on itsmicrobial or enzymatic degradation. Synthetic lignins and
simple model compounds (incorporating radioactive label-ling) were used to unravel the mechanisms of lignin attackby white-rot basidiomycetes, the only organisms that areable to extensively mineralize lignin (Eriksson et al. ,
1990). The complexity shown by the ﬁrst lignin modelsand the variety of compounds identiﬁed in early lignocel-lulose biodegradation studies (Chen and Chang, 1985)suggested a set of different degradative enzymes attack-ing the different lignin substructures and releasing differ-ent breakdown products. However, subsequent workusing model compounds representative of the main sub-structures found in lignin revealed that lignin-degradingorganisms just adopted the opposite strategy. Thesestudies, instead of revealing a variety of enzymes catal-ysing the different reactions observed, showed that thelatter were the result of an unspeciﬁc oxidative attack onthe benzenic rings of lignin units followed by differentbond breakdown reactions due to the chemical instabilityof the cation radicals formed (Kirk and Farrell, 1987).
Moreover, using simple model compounds, it was pos-
sible to demonstrate that among the different oxidativeenzymes produced by lignin-degrading organisms, only agroup of basidiomycete haemperoxidases could directlyattack the non-phenolic lignin network (Martínez, 2002;Hammel and Cullen, 2008). These enzymes include ligninperoxidase (LiP) initially described in Phanerochaete
chrysosporium , the ﬁrst basidiomycete whose genome
was sequenced due to the interest on biological degrada-tion of lignin (Martínez et al. , 2004), and a versatile per-
oxidase (VP) more recently reported in Pleurotus and
Bjerkandera species, the former genus including species
being able to degrade lignin selectively (Martínez et al. ,
1994). VP is also able to oxidize Mn
2+, as reported for P.
chrysosporium manganese peroxidase (MnP). The Mn3+
resulting from the action of these two peroxidases oxi-
dizes phenolic compounds but, in the presence of unsat-urated lipids, it can also oxidize non-phenolic lignin viaperoxidation radicals (Bao et al. , 1994). The molecular
evolution of ligninolytic peroxidases has been shown by arecent study (Morgenstern et al. , 2008).
Taking into account the unique characteristics of the
microbial attack to lignin, compared with hydrolytic attackto other natural polymers including plant carbohydrates,the process was described as an ‘enzymatic combustion’where enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide oxi-dizes the lignin polymer in a reaction catalysed bythe above-mentioned high-redox-potential peroxidases(Kirk and Farrell, 1987) (Fig. 2). Simultaneously to thediscovery of ligninolytic peroxidases, several peroxide-generating oxidases were described in ligninolytic fungi,such as glyoxal oxidase (a copper radical enzyme), aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO) and pyranose-2 oxidase (two ﬂa-voenzymes) (Martínez et al. , 2005).

Gymnosperms produce the simplest lignin type formed only by guaiacyl units derived from coniferyl alcohol ( 2). In contrast, angiosperm lignin
also include p-hydroxyphenyl and sinapyl units derived from p-coumaryl ( 1) and sinapyl ( 3) alcohols, as well as a variable amount of acylated
lignin often derived from sinapyl alcohol g-esteriﬁed with acetic ( 4),p-coumaric acid ( 5) or other organic acids (Ralph et al. , 2004; Martínez
et al. , 2008). A variety of ether and carbon–carbon inter-unit linkages are formed during monolignol radical polymerization resulting in b-O-4 ′
(A), phenylcoumaran ( B), pinoresinol ( C) and dibenzodioxocin ( D) substructures, among others. Linkages to additional lignin chains are
indicated (L-containing circles). Other minor structures (in brackets) include vanillin, coniferyl alcohol and dimethylcyclohexadienone-type units,
the latter in new spirodienone substructures (Zhang et al. , 2006) (courtesy of G. Gellerstedt).

non-phenolic aromatic aldehydes (such as the fungal metabolite p-anisaldehyde) with participation of intracellular aryl-aldehyde
dehydrogenase. Peroxidase one-electron oxidation of lignin units (the key step in the degradative process) results in an unstable cation radicalthat experiences different reactions including breakdown of C
a–C band C 4–ether linkages releasing the corresponding aromatic aldehydes
(vanillin in the case of guaiacyl units) that can be intracellularly mineralized. In the case of P. chrysosporium LiP , lignin attack requires the
presence of veratryl alcohol, probably as an enzyme-bound mediator, and hydrogen peroxide is mainly generated by glyoxal oxidase.Action mechanisms of ligninolytic peroxidases 167

Journal compilation © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Microbial Biotechnology ,2, 164–177continuous production of hydrogen peroxide during redox
cycling of anisaldehyde, an extracellular metabolite(Gutiérrez et al. , 1994) is produced involving mycelium-
associated aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (a NADPHdehydrogenase) working together with extracellular AAO(Guillén and Evans, 1994) (Fig. 2). In P. chrysosporium ,
glyoxal oxidase uses products from lignocellulose degra-dation as the enzyme-reducing substrates for generatingthe hydrogen peroxide required by the ligninolytic peroxi-dases (Kersten and Cullen, 2007). The unstable cationradicals formed during peroxidase attack to lignin modelcompounds experience different chemical reactionsincluding breakdown of C
a–C band C 4–ether linkages
resulting in the release of aromatic aldehydes, one of themain products found during enzymatic depolymerizationof lignin (Fig. 2), together with other reactions such asdemethoxylation (methanol release) and aromatic-ringcleavage (with formation of muconate-type structures)(Martínez et al. , 2005).
The involvement of ligninolytic peroxidases in wood
lignin degradation has been recently supported by com-parison of the genomes of P. chrysosporium (Martínez
et al. , 2004), a model white-rot fungus characterized by its
ability to remove wood lignin leaving a whitish cellulosicresidue, and Postia placenta (Martinez et al. , 2009), a
model brown-rot fungus characterized by its ability toremove wood polysaccharides leaving a brown lignin-enriched residue. This comparison showed a large set ofligninolytic peroxidase genes in the genome of P. chrysos-
porium , in agreement with previous studies (Cullen,
1997). In contrast, the P. placenta genome includes genes
of oxidases and other enzymes involved in celluloseattack via Fenton chemistry, but contains an unique per-oxidase gene related to the low-redox-potential peroxi-dase of the non-ligninolytic basidiomycete Coprinopsis
cinerea (CIP), and completely lacks ligninolytic peroxi-
dase genes ( lip,vpormnp ).
A third type of microbial oxidoreductases, laccases and
related multicopper oxidases are produced by most ligni-nolytic basidiomycetes (Baldrian, 2006) as well as byeubacteria and actinomycetes growing on lignocellulosicmaterials (Sharma et al. , 2007). The low redox potential of
laccases prevents their direct action on lignin. However,they can degrade this and other recalcitrant compounds inthe presence of redox mediators, as discussed below.Laccases also play a variety of other physiological rolesincluding mushroom morphogenesis, detoxiﬁcation andhumiﬁcation, among others (Claus, 2004). Moreover, theyseem involved in generation of lignocellulose-degradinghydroxyl radical (via Fenton chemistry) in both white-rot(Guillén et al. , 2000) and at least some brown-rot basidi-
omycetes, in agreement with the presence of laccasegenes in the genome of P. placenta (http://genome.jgi-
psf.org/Pospl1/Pospl1.home.html).General determinants of ligninolytic peroxidase
structure and activity
All prokaryotic, fungal and plant haemperoxidases share
a common folding and helical topology described in cyto-chrome cperoxidase (CCP), the ﬁrst peroxidase whose
crystal structure was reported (Poulos et al. , 1980) and
only more recently (Gajhede et al. , 1997) in the best-
known peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP). It isnoteworthy that LiP , an enzyme that was completelyunknown until 1983 (Glenn et al. , 1983; Tien and Kirk,
1983), was the second peroxidase whose crystal struc-ture was reported (Piontek et al. , 1993; Poulos et al. ,
1993). The rapid progresses of LiP structure–functionstudies, as well as the fact that two groups reported simul-taneously its discovery and crystal structure, demonstratethe interest on high-redox-potential peroxidases.
As mentioned above, all peroxidases require hydrogen
peroxide, or other hydroperoxides, to activate the haemcofactor yielding the so-called compound-I in a commoncatalytic cycle (Dunford, 1999) (Fig. 3). Compound-I con-tains a reactive Fe
4+oxo complex with a cation radical at
the porphyrin ring, formed by two-electron oxidation ofthe Fe
3+-containing haem of the resting enzyme. One-
electron oxidation of one substrate molecule yieldscompound-II, where the porphyrin cation radical has beenreduced. The remaining Fe
4+=O in compound-II oxidizes a
second substrate molecule, and the enzyme returns to itsferric resting state to initiate a new catalytic cycle.SSoxC-II

in two one-electron steps results in the intermediate compound-II(C-II; containing Fe
4+=O after porphyrin reduction) and then the
resting form of the enzyme, with concomitant oxidation of twosubstrate molecules (S; which could be low-redox-potential phenolsand dyes, or Mn
2+in the cases of MnP and VP).168 F. J. Ruiz-Dueñas and Á. T. Martínez

Journal compilation © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Microbial Biotechnology ,2, 164–177The molecular structure of haemperoxidases includes
two domains, probably originating from ancestral geneduplication, delimiting a central cavity where the haemcofactor is located (Li and Poulos, 1994; Banci, 1997). Inmost cases, the access of both the enzyme-oxidizing(peroxide) and -reducing substrates to the haem cofactoris produced through a main access channel (Fig. 4, left).Taking into account the high reactivity of both compound-Iand compound-II, this internal location of the cofactormost probably plays a dual role. First, it prevents unspe-ciﬁc reduction of the activated enzyme by a variety ofreductants different from its speciﬁc target substrate.Second, it prevents intermolecular reaction resulting inoxidation of surface susceptible amino acids (e.g. tyrosineresidues) leading to enzyme inactivation (e.g. by dimer-ization reactions). Oxidation of Mn
2+by basidiomycete
MnP and VP is also produced through a speciﬁc accesschannel enabling entering of the cation to reach one of thehaem propionates (Fig. 4, left). The edge of this channelincludes three acidic residues that bind Mn
2+speciﬁcally
enabling its high-efficiency oxidation.
A detail of the haem environment and other neighbour
amino acid residues in a ligninolytic peroxidase ( Pleurotus
eryngii VP) is shown in Fig. 5. These include two axialhistidine residues, the so-called proximal (His-169) and
distal (His-47) histidines, and other conserved residues(Martínez, 2002). Proximal histidine acts as the ﬁfth ligandof the haem iron together with the four nitrogens of thetetrapyrrolic macrocycle, while distal histidine togetherwith a conserved arginine (VP Arg-43) contributes to ironreaction with hydrogen peroxide in compound-I formation(Hiner et al. , 2002). Two aromatic residues are also highly
conserved at the proximal (Phe-186) and distal (Phe-46)sides of the haem of many peroxidases, in CCP being twotryptophan residues one of them playing a direct role incatalysis as mentioned below. Two more residues at theproximal (Asp-231) and distal (Asn-78) sides of the haemestablish hydrogen bonds with the two histidines. Twostructural Ca
2+ions are located in conserved binding sites
at the two peroxidase domains contributing to folding. Theabove-mentioned Mn
2+-oxidation site of VP (and MnP) is
shown at the right side of haem, being formed by threeacidic residues positioning the cation near one of thehaem propionates for direct electron transfer (Gold et al. ,
2000; Ruiz-Dueñas et al. , 2007). Finally, a tryptophan
residue (Trp-164) is shown at the left side of the haem,being involved in oxidation of high-redox-potential aro-matic compounds (together with contiguous Leu-165) as

includes several molecules of water, including those com-pleting the characteristic coordinations of Mn
2+and Ca2+
ions. Another water molecule (w71) could act as the sixth
ligand of the haem Fe3+at a position close to that occu-
pied by the Fe4+=O oxygen of compound-I and compound-
II, as shown for HRP (Berglund et al. , 2002).
It has been shown that the redox potential of peroxidase
compound-I and compound-II depends of the haem envi-ronment characteristics, as shown by
1H-NMR spectra of
the cyanide adduct of the enzyme (Banci et al. , 1991;
2003). These included, as one of the most importantfactors, the position and more or less marked imidazolatecharacter of the proximal histidine side-chain, whose N
1
acts as the ﬁfth ligand of the haem iron. The strength of this
bond affects the electron deﬁciency of iron and, conse-quently, the reactivity of the activated enzyme. The char-acteristics of the proximal histidine side-chain that areaffected by H-bonding to other residues (such as Asp-231in Fig. 5) (Banci et al. , 1995) and the position of helix F
where this residue is located (Piontek et al. , 1993) affect
the chemical shift of its H e1 signal (which was found at
about -8 p.p.m. in LiP , -16 p.p.m. in VP , -22 p.p.m. in CCP
and -32 p.p.m. in HRP spectra) in agreement with the
reported higher redox potential of ligninolytic peroxidasescompared with plant peroxidases (Millis et al. , 1989).Fig. 5. Details of haem environment and

Journal compilation © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Microbial Biotechnology ,2, 164–177Direct peroxidase oxidation of lignin: long-range
electron transfer (LRET) mechanism
When the crystal structure of P. chrysosporium LiP was
reported, it was assumed that this peroxidase wouldoxidize high-redox-potential aromatic compounds at themain haem access channel. In fact, veratryl alcohol wasmodelled at the crystal structure channel to determine theeventual contacts (Poulos et al. , 1993). This is the classi-
cal peroxidase substrate oxidation site, as shown in plantHRP and in the low-redox-potential fungal CIP (Smith andVeitch, 1998). However, the main haem access channel ofLiP is signiﬁcantly narrower than those of CIP or HRP , andthe hypothesis of long-range electron transfer (LRET) oxi-dation of lignin at the protein surface, initially proposed byDu and colleagues (1992) and Schoemaker and col-leagues (1994), was adopted by other authors.
Protein LRET requires the existence of an amino acid
residue susceptible to form a stable radical (preferably atyrosine, tryptophan or histidine residue) located at theprotein surface and adequately connected to the haemcofactor for electron transfer. The above authors sug-gested two residues (Trp-171 and His-82) as the origin oftwo LRET pathways for oxidation of high-redox-potentialaromatic compounds by LiP . Several years later a thirdpathway was proposed (initiating at His-239) (Johjimaet al. , 1999). No pathway starting at a tyrosine residue
has been proposed since all ligninolytic peroxidasescloned up to date (a total of near 50 sequences) are freeof tyrosine residues (to prevent oxidative inactivation) withthe only exception of a Trametes cervina LiP discussed
below.
The same three putative LRET pathways were identi-
ﬁed in P. eryngii VP , and their eventual operation was
investigated by site-directed mutagenesis by Pérez-Boada and colleagues (2005). This study deﬁnitivelyshowed that only the pathway starting at the exposedtryptophan (Trp-164 of isoenzyme VPL) was operative foroxidation of high-redox-potential aromatic compoundsincluding veratryl alcohol. The position of this residue atthe vicinity of the haem cofactor is illustrated in Fig. 5,which also shows a leucine residue involved in the elec-tron transfer; and the solvent exposed aromatic side-chain of this tryptophan is shown in Fig. 4 (right). Thecatalytic role of a homologous tryptophan has also beenshown in VP from other fungi (Tinoco et al. , 2007; Tsuki-
hara et al. , 2008). Formation of the tryptophanyl-free
radical postulated by Du and colleagues (1992) wasconﬁrmed by low-temperature electron paramagneticresonance (EPR) of peroxide-activated VP (Pogni et al. ,
2006).
The involvement of the homologous tryptophan residue
of LiP (Trp-171) in oxidation of veratryl alcohol and, moreinterestingly, of a tetrameric lignin model compoundwas also conﬁrmed by mutagenesis (Doyle et al. , 1998;
Mester et al. , 2001). Although the LiP tryptophanyl radical
was not directly detected, as reported by VP EPR, indirectevidence for its presence in the activated enzyme wasobtained by adduct formation (Blodig et al. , 1999).
A difference between the two ligninolytic peroxidases
concerns the surface environment of the catalytic tryp-tophan, which in LiP has a partial negative charge,whereas in VP some acidic residues are substituted bybasic residues (Fig. 4, right). A noteworthy characteristicof VP is its ability to oxidize directly a series of high-redox-potential substrates that LiP is able to oxidize only in thepresence of veratryl alcohol (see below). This fact isrelated to the catalytic tryptophan environment, and acharge inversion VP variant (R257D) was obtained thatexhibited a LiP-type behaviour during oxidation of high-redox-potential dyes (Ruiz-Dueñas et al. , 2008).
After demonstrating the involvement of a protein radical
in substrate oxidation by ligninolytic peroxidases, anextended catalytic cycle has been proposed for VP(Fig. 6) that in general terms can be also applied to P.
chrysosporium LiP . In this cycle, compound-I

A different LiP form lacking a catalytic tryptophan
residue has been reported in T. cervina (Miki et al. ,
2006). This unique peroxidase presents an exposedtyrosine at a different position of the molecule thatseems to play the same role of the above tryptophan.Interestingly, a plant peroxidase using a tyrosyl radicalfor oxidation of bulky phenols such as sinapyl alcohol(structure 3in Fig. 1) has been recently reported (Sasaki
et al. , 2008).
Redox mediators in lignin degradation
The use of small chemical oxidizers acting as redox
mediators represents a second alternative to overcomethe difficulties associated to the limited access of thebulky lignin polymer to the activated cofactor of peroxi-dases and other oxidoreductases. Enzyme-mediatorsystems have been extensively investigated in the case oflaccases after the work of Bourbonnais and Paice (1990)reporting that synthetic mediators expanded the applica-tion potential of these low-redox-potential oxidoreduc-tases enabling oxidation of non-phenolic lignin modelcompounds. These mediators are low-molecular-masscompounds that: (i) form stable free radicals oxidizingcompounds that the enzyme alone is not able to oxidize,and (ii) diffuse away from the enzyme and can easilypenetrate the lignocellulose matrix. It has been recentlyshown that some phenolic lignin precursors or degrada-tion products can be used as ‘natural’ laccase mediatorsin industrial processes, and suggested that some of themcould play a similar role in nature (Camarero et al. , 2005).
However, the real signiﬁcance of the laccase-mediatorsystems in natural biodegradation of lignin is still to bedemonstrated.
The existence of an exposed protein radical transferring
electrons to the haem via a LRET pathway enables LiPdirect oxidation of veratryl alcohol and lignin model com-pounds, including non-phenolic tetramers (Mester et al. ,
2001). However, LiP requires the presence of veratrylalcohol or other compounds forming aromatic cation radi-cals, to oxidize polymeric lignin and high-redox-potentialdyes (Harvey et al. , 1986). This contrasts with the ‘veratryl
alcohol-independent’ activity of VP oxidizing differentcompounds including lignin (Heinﬂing et al. , 1998a;
Camarero et al. , 2001). The role of veratryl alcohol cation
radical as a real mediator in LiP reactions has been matterof controversy, taking into account the short half-life of thisspecies in aqueous media (Candeias and Harvey, 1995).However, the acidic environment surrounding LiP Trp-171could stabilize the cation radical that would act as an
enzyme-bound mediator (Khindaria et al. , 1996).
Biotechnological interest and future trends
Microbial oxidoreductases, including both peroxidases
and laccases, have been investigated for biotechnologicalapplication including paper pulp bleaching in chlorine-freesequences (Paice et al. , 1995; Bajpai, 2004; Sigoillot
et al. , 2005). Ligninolytic peroxidases, in contrast to lac-
cases and low-redox-potential peroxidases that are usedin several industrial sectors (e.g. textiles, detergents, foodand beverages, etc.), are not still commercially availabledue to different reasons including the low levels ofenzyme obtained from natural and recombinant hosts.Moreover, these oxidoreductases in most cases are notsuitable biocatalysts as they are produced in nature.Industrial processes often require enzymes recognizingspeciﬁc substrates or proceeding under extreme condi-tions (e.g. high hydrogen peroxide concentration orextreme pH and temperature).
Laccases have low redox potential and can degrade
recalcitrant compounds only in the presence of redoxmediators. However, the laccase-mediator system hasbecame extremely popular in biodegradation studies, aswell as for processing and functionalization of lignocellu-losic ﬁbres (Riva, 2006; Widsten and Kandelbauer, 2008).In spite of ‘natural’ laccase mediators have been reportedas potential substitutes of synthetic -N(OH)- compoundsin different applications (Camarero et al. , 2007; Cañas
et al. , 2007; Gutiérrez et al. , 2007), economic issues
related to the cost of the mediator, and environmentalconcerns related to the eventual release of toxic com-pounds during the enzymatic treatment are main draw-backs for the industrial implementation of this enzymaticsystem in the pulp and paper and other industrial sectors.
In contrast to laccases, some ligninolytic peroxidases
do not require mediators to degrade high-redox-potentialcompounds. Indeed, they should be the enzymes ofchoice for removing lignin or transforming high-redox-potential aromatic compounds in different applications.The rapid acquisition of knowledge on the structure andfunction of these enzymes over the last years has beenused to modulate their catalytic and operational propertiesusing site-directed mutagenesis in a variety of studies(Timofeevski et al. , 1999; Reading and Aust, 2000; Celik
et al. , 2001; Mester and Tien, 2001; Feng et al. , 2003). In
those cases where the structural basis of the property tobe improved is unknown, or too difficult to be predicted,directed evolution or saturation mutagenesis is theapproach of choice (Cherry et al. , 1999; Miyazaki-
Imamura et al. , 2003; Ryu et al. , 2008). Some future
trends in the industrial use of basidiomycete peroxidasesare discussed below.172 F. J. Ruiz-Dueñas and Á. T. Martínez
© 2009 The Authors
Journal compilation © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Microbial Biotechnology ,2, 164–177Considerable efforts have been devoted during the last
years to improve the expression of ligninolytic and otherperoxidases in different fungal hosts using a variety ofstrategies. Among others, strong promoters, proteasedeﬁcient strains, molecular chaperones and externalsources of haem have been used with only partially suc-cessful results (Stewart et al. , 1996; Conesa et al. , 2000;
2002; Gu et al. , 2003; Lú-Chau et al. , 2004; Wang et al. ,
2004; Eibes et al. , 2009). New strategies based on con-
verting low-redox-potential peroxidases, easily to expressat levels of several grams per litre, into high-redox-potential peroxidases are being developed taking advan-tage of the structure–function knowledge accumulated. Inthis sense, CIP has been successfully modiﬁed and trans-formed into a LiP-like enzyme by introducing a catalytictryptophan, at the same time that the acidity of the localenvironment of this residue was increased (Smith andDoyle, 2006). Although the mutated enzyme was not soefficient as a true LiP , it is possible to predict that addi-tional modiﬁcations will yield an enzyme with the expectedcatalytic activity.
Hydrogen peroxide inactivate all peroxidases after
several cycles of catalysis as a consequence of the com-petition between productive and unproductive electronsources (including enzyme components) in a processdescribed as a suicide inactivation (Valderrama et al. ,
2002). Different attempts aimed to improve hydrogenperoxide stability of ligninolytic peroxidases have beenperformed, mainly removing easily oxidizable and con-formationally unstable amino acid residues located atthe peroxide-binding side of haem with very promisingresults (Miyazaki and Takahashi, 2001; Miyazaki-Imamura et al. , 2003). Recently, a novel peroxidase from
Raphanus sativus has been identiﬁed and characterized
as the only known case of a haemperoxidase intrinsicallyresistant to hydrogen peroxide (Gil-Rodríguez et al. ,
2008). In-depth analysis of its structure will give the ﬁrststructural evidences of peroxide stability to be used toincrease the peroxide stability of ligninolytic and otherperoxidases.
pH and temperature inactivation of ligninolytic peroxi-
dases is associated to the release of the two structuralCa
2+involved in stabilization of the molecular architecture
(Sutherland and Aust, 1996; George et al. , 1999; Lú-Chau
et al. , 2004). It has been described that losing these ions
causes hexacoordination of the haem iron preventing LiPand MnP activation by hydrogen peroxide, although morerecently a decrease in redox potential has been sug-gested as the main inactivation cause in VP (Verdín et al. ,
2006). Some authors have succeeded stabilizing peroxi-dases by avoiding the lose of Ca
2+by adding extra disul-
ﬁde bridges (Reading and Aust, 2000). Generation of theappropriate disulﬁde bridges could not only make theseenzymes resistant to high pH and temperature, but itcould also be used to increase their redox potential.
Thermal inactivation has been also related to destabilizinginteractions between adjacent acidic side-chains. Muta-tions removing one of these interactions in CIP improvedits thermal stability by 134-fold (Cherry et al. , 1999). Curi-
ously these two residues are conserved in ligninolyticperoxidases (LiP , MnP and VP), and additional interac-tions between acidic residues can be observed in otherregions of their molecular structures. It is expected thatsubstitution of one amino acid residue of these acidiccouples will promote enzyme stabilization towards hightemperature, as described for CIP .
Among ligninolytic peroxidases, VP presents especial
biotechnological interest due to different reasons includ-ing: (i) catalytic versatility by combination of differentsubstrate oxidation sites, and (ii) ability to degrade somecompounds of interest that LiP and MnP (as well as CIP)are not able to oxidize directly. Its catalytic versatilitypermits the application of VP in Mn
3+-mediated or
Mn-independent reactions on both low- and high-redox-potential substrates. The possibility to degrade directly avariety of recalcitrant compounds represents a consider-able advantage compared with LiP since the cost of vera-tryl alcohol required as mediator can be saved. Among thedifferent compounds of industrial and/or environmentalinterest that VP can transform, polycyclic aromatic hydro-carbons (Wang et al. , 2003), phenolic and non-phenolic
aromatic pollutants (Rodríguez et al. , 2004), pesticides
(Dávila-Vázquez et al. , 2005) and a variety of industrial
dyes (Heinﬂing et al. , 1998b) can be cited (including,
among others, Reactive Blue 38 and other azo dyes,Reactive Black 5 and other phthalocyanine dyes,anthracene and derivatives, benzo[a]pyrene, pyrene, 2,4-dichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol). For some appli-cations the use of VP in combination with redox mediatorscan also be considered (Tinoco et al. , 2007). Among
them, the use of VP to reoxidize Mn
2+-containing polyoxo-
metalates is an interesting possibility (Marques et al. ,
2008), since these highly promising catalysts for environ-mentally friendly deligniﬁcation are very difficult to bechemically reoxidized.
The promiscuity of ligninolytic fungi and their enzymes
oxidizing aromatic xenobiotics and other recalcitrant com-pounds is due to the involvement of the lignin-degradingenzymatic machinery in many of these reactions. To over-come the bulky nature and structural heterogeneity of thelignin polymer, these microorganisms have developed ahighly unspeciﬁc extracellular system being able to sub-tract one electron directly from the benzenic rings of thedifferent lignin units. High-redox-potential extracellularperoxidases, often forming catalytic radicals at the proteinsurface, are the key enzymes in this initial attack yieldingpartially oxidized products whose catabolism is ﬁnallycompleted intracellularly.Action mechanisms of ligninolytic peroxidases 173
