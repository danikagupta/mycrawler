Pellet softening ABSTRACT  
Drinking water softening is often implemented to increase consumer convenience e.g. by reducing lime scaling 
and soap use. Softening reduces hardness, but changes also the overall mineral composition of the water, 
depending on the technology. A broad spectrum of effects from softening has to be considered in relation to e.g. 
health and corrosion when selecting softening technology and design, otherwise adverse effects may be over-
looked in the attempt to increase consumer convenience. We here provided a framework for evaluating softening 
technologies using water quality indicators for lime scaling, soap use, corrosion, human health, taste and removal 
of contaminants. None of the evaluated softening technologies scored positive on all the included water quality 
indicators. Precipitation technologies (lime/soda-ash softening and pellet softening) reduce the predicted copper 
and lead release, but negatively affect stainless steel corrosion expressed by the Larson Ratio. Pellet softening 
does not remove magnesium, which may limit the achievable softening depth, but maintains a protective effect 
against cardio-vascular diseases. Strong-acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion 
indicators, whereas the effects from membrane separation (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) and weak-acid 
cation exchange depend on the specific source water and process design. All the evaluated technologies 
reduce hardness, calcium carbonate precipitation potential (CCPP) and atopic eczema, but have potential 
adverse effects on dental carries (expressed by DMF-S). Our framework provides a better understanding of 
softening and can prepare water utility planners and managers for better decisions that balance the positive and 
adverse effects from drinking water softening.   
1.Introduction 
Centralized drinking water softening can provide socioeconomic and 
environmental benefits in areas with hard drinking water (Beeftink 
et al., 2021 ; Godskesen et al., 2012 ; van der Bruggen et al., 2009 ). 
Historically, softening has been implemented to reduce copper (Cu) and 
lead (Pb) released from pipe materials and thereby comply with drinking 
water quality guidelines (Mons et al., 2007 ). Nowadays, softening is 
often motivated in improvement of consumer convenience by reducing 
adverse effects from hard water such as increased soap use and lime 
scaling in household installations and appliances (Hofman et al., 2007 ; 
Mons et al., 2007 ). Thus, the resulting water quality and softening depth 
(i.e. hardness removal) is not defined by specific guidelines, but by the 
motivation for improvement of the water characteristics, by the effects in the distribution system, and by the consumers. 
Drinking water softening technologies reduces the water hardness, 
which in practice is defined as the sum of calcium (Ca2) and magne -
sium (Mg2) ions (de Moel et al., 2006 ; Loewenthal and Marais, 1976 ). 
Softening technologies not only reduce hardness, but they also alter the 
overall mineral composition of the drinking water differently, depend -
ing on the technology (Mons et al., 2007 ; Ruhland and Jekel, 2004 ). 
Consequently, the effects from softening are beyond hardness removal 
(Tang et al., 2019b ) and may also include effects on e.g. corrosion, 
health and taste. If hardness removal is the only aspect considered when 
designing the softening process, adverse effects may be overlooked 
compromising the overall benefits from softening. 
It is very difficult to quantify how water treatment processes affect e. 
g. lime scaling or corrosion from the individual water quality

2parameters, but it can be predicted by water quality indicators (or 
indices). Indicators integrate a broad range of effects and are often 
applied in decision support analyses such as multi-criteria decision 
analysis to account for technical (e.g. performance), environmental (e.g. 
carbon footprint and energy use), economic (e.g. net present value and 
construction costs), and sociocultural (e.g. cultural acceptance) aspects 
(Beeftink et al., 2021 ; Godskesen et al., 2018 ; Hajkowicz and Collins, 
2007 ; Hamouda and Huck, 2010 ). Considering all the above aspects 
allows for a broad evaluation of e.g. environmental and economic sus-
tainability of the treatment process (Godskesen et al., 2018 ; Marques 
et al., 2015 ), but can also increase the complexity and data requirement 
(Hamouda et al., 2014 ). Unfortunately, in the desire to overcome this 
complexity the evaluation of water quality is sometimes limited to a few 
indicators such as “removal efficiency ” for a single water quality 
parameter or pollutant (e.g. Hamouda and Huck, 2010 ; Santos et al., 
2016 ), thereby neglecting the effects on the overall water quality. 
So far, literature has either focused on the individual drinking water 
softening technologies (e.g. Holl and Hagen, 2002 ; Shahmansouri and 
Bellona, 2015 ; van der Bruggen et al., 2001 ) or reviewed the removal of 
specific, individual water quality parameters by various treatment pro-
cesses (e.g. Kapoor and Viraraghavan, 1997 ; Karunanithi et al., 2019 ; 
Zhang et al., 2015 ). Only few papers have addressed the selection of 
softening technology and they only include few technologies and water 
quality effects (Bergman, 1995 ; Ruhland and Jekel, 2004 ; Sombekke 
et al., 1997 ; Tang et al., 2019b ; Thompson and Azar, 1999 ). To our 
knowledge, a framework does not exist to evaluate softening technolo -
gies based on a broad spectrum of water quality indicators. Such a 
framework can provide decision support when choosing softening 
technology by achieving the full potential of softening while limiting 
adverse consequences on e.g. corrosion and human health, ultimately 
optimizing the overall water quality after softening. 
Our study aimed to provide a framework for evaluation and com-
parison of softening technologies and their effects on soap use, corro -
sion, lime scaling, taste and health using selected water quality 
indicators. To fulfill the aim we 1) identified relevant indicators for 
water quality and their targets, 2) identified softening technologies 
currently used in full-scale, and 3) evaluated how each softening tech-
nology affects our chosen water quality indicators. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Evaluation method 
To evaluate the softening technologies and their consequences 
experienced by the consumers we developed a framework with four 
steps (Fig. 1). We distinguished between water quality parameters and water quality indicators . Consequences of softening such as corrosion or 
human health effects can be predicted using water quality indicators (e.g. 
Larson Ratio and CCPP), whereas water quality parameters refer to ionic 
species and other drinking water components required to calculate the 
indicators (e.g. Ca2or Mg2concentrations). 
In the first step of the framework, we identified relevant indicators 
(Section 2.2), as well as their targets and the water quality parameters 
required to quantify them (step 2, Section 3.1). In the third step, we 
identified softening technologies currently used in full-scale softening 
and screened for how they change the water quality parameters of 
importance for each indicator (Section 3.2 and 3.3). 
In the final step of the framework (“technology evaluation ”), we 
evaluated how each of the softening technologies affect the water 
quality indicators based on the changes to the water quality parameters 
(Section 3.4). For consistency, we describe a parameter change that 
brings an indicator further away from the identified target as an 
“adverse effect ”. On the other hand, a “positive effect ” describes a 
parameter change that brings the indicator closer to the target (Table 1). 
Based on the evaluation of the individual parameters, the overall 
effect on the water quality indicator was assessed (Table 1). If a tech-
nology did not change the parameters, the overall effect was categorized 
as “no effect ”. If a technology had only adverse changes to the param -
eters, the overall effect was characterized as “adverse ” and similarly for 
positive effects. If the technology provided a mix of positive and adverse 
changes to the parameters, the overall effect was characterized as 
“indecisive ”. 
If a technology only changed a water quality parameter less than 15 
% from its initial value, we considered that there would be no relevant 
water quality effects. 
2.2. Water quality indicators 
We selected a range of existing water quality indicators to evaluate a 
broad spectrum of consequences from softening (Table 2). Softening is 
implemented for various reasons, e.g. to reduce soap use, lime scaling or 
corrosion of copper and lead from pipe materials to the drinking water 
(Mons et al., 2007 ), and consequently, we included indicators to quan-
tify these effects (Table 2). We included the Larson ratio, commonly used 
to assess the corrosion potential of drinking water. We included the 
health effects selected by Rygaard et al. (2009) (dental caries, cardio -
vascular diseases and atopic eczema) who valuated the effects from 
water quality changes due to reverse osmosis. Finally, we included water 
taste and the technologies ’ ability to act as a barrier towards organic and 
inorganic contaminants in the evaluation (Table 2). We categorized the 
different water quality indicators based on their consequences (e.g. 
corrosion, health and taste) in a drinking water system. 
Water quality parameters required to calculate the indicators and 
their target values were identified in the cited literature. Furthermore, 
we identified if minimizing or maximizing the parameter concentrations 
brings the indicator closer to the target value. 
2.3. Technology screening

Scopus and more (DTU Library, 2021 ), was used to identify technologies

3for centralized drinking water softening and their effects on water 
quality. Search words included general terms (e.g. “water softening ” and 
“hardness removal ”), specific technologies (e.g. “cation exchange ” and 
“pellet softening ”), groups of water quality parameters (e.g. “divalent 
ion removal ”) and specific water quality parameters (e.g. “sulphate 
removal drinking water ”). The search included the entire paper and no 
restrictions on year publication, although recent publications (2010 and 
onwards) were prioritized over older publications. 
We limited the literature search to:  
≡Technologies currently commercially available for full-scale 
centralized drinking water softening, excluding emerging technolo -
gies and technologies for pre- and post-treatment. 
≡Technologies that remove hardness from the water, excluding tech-
nologies claiming to physically reduce lime scaling in households 
using e.g. ultrasound, electromagnetism and electrostatic forces ≡Studies that include water samples from actual drinking water sys-
tems, excluding studies with synthetically prepared water solutions 
with a limited number of ions 
The latter point was necessary because membrane treatment of 
synthetic water compositions may vary greatly from natural waters, 
where e.g. the interaction between ions and ionic strength affect the 
rejection of ions (Santaf ˘e-Moros et al., 2005 ). 
Some studies report water quality changes as concentrations before 
(Cbefore softening ) and after softening (Cafter softening ). When appropriate 
(see Section 3.3), we converted these concentration changes to a percent 
removal/rejection (Eq. 1).

43.Results 
3.1. Identification of indicator targets and relevant water quality 
parameters 
To evaluate if water quality changes were positive or adverse, we 
identified a qualitative target (e.g. “as high as possible ”) for each of the 
indicators presented in Table 2 (i.e. step 2 in Fig. 1, Table 3). The targets 
only apply for the specific indicator and may represent a less optimal 
target for other impacts unrelated to the softening technology. For 
instance, pH should be as high as possible to avoid copper corrosion, but 
a high pH reduces the efficiency of chlorine disinfection (Lahav and 
Birnhack, 2007 ), which was not included in our evaluation. 
In addition, we identified water quality parameters required to 
calculate the indicators and if the concentrations of these parameters 
should be minimized or maximized in hard water to approach the in-
dicator targets (Table 3):  
≡Hardness, and thereby the concentrations of Ca2and Mg2, should 
be as low as possible to reduce soap use (Mons et al., 2007 ).  
≡CCPP is mainly affected by the concentrations of Ca2and HCO 3 as 
well as pH and temperature (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2017 ), which are 
the parameters included in this study; however, CCPP is most accu-
rately calculated when a range of further ionic species are included 
(as discussed in Tang et al., (2021) ). CCPP should be as low as 
possible to reduce lime scaling. However, it should be slightly posi-
tive to avoid water that is CaCO 3-dissolving, which can lead to 
corrosion (Lahav and Birnhack, 2007 ).  
≡The Larson Ratio should be as low as possible to prevent steel 
corrosion (Larson and Skold, 1958 ). The Larson Ratio decreases with 
increasing HCO 3 concentration or decreasing concentrations of Cl 
and SO42 . On the other hand, increasing SO42 concentration may 
also reduce Pb-release from pipe materials showing that some water 
quality parameters have contradictory effects on corrosion (Table 3).  
≡Copper (Cu)-release from especially new pipe materials increases 
with decreasing pH and increasing alkalinity and should be as low as 
possible (Edwards et al., 1996 ).  
≡Lead (Pb)-release from pipes can be predicted from the water 
alkalinity, temperature, pH, Cl and SO42 concentrations (Imran 
et al., 2006 ). Temperature, alkalinity and Cl should be minimized 
and pH and SO42 should be maximized for the Pb-release to be as 
low as possible.  
≡Decayed, Missing, and Filled tooth Surfaces (DMF-S) caused by 
caries among Danish school children was related to the Ca2and F 
concentration in drinking water (Arvin et al., 2017 ; Bruvo et al., 
2008 ). DMF-S increases with decreasing concentrations of Ca2and 
F .  
≡Ca2�has been associated with atopic eczema among children 
(Mcnally et al., 1998 ) and should be minimized.  
≡Mg2�likely has a protective effect towards cardiovascular diseases 
(Kozisek, 2020 ) and should for that purpose be maximized.  
≡Taste: We were unable to identify an indicator for predicting water 
taste. Platikanov et al. (2013) identified ions with a positive effect 
(Ca2, Mg2, SO42 and HCO 3 ) and with a negative effect (Na, K
and Cl ) on drinking water taste using trained panellists. The total 
dissolved solids (TDS) also affected drinking water taste with 
preferred values around 200-400 mg/L (Platikanov et al., 2013 ), 
which was not considered further, since TDS after softening depends 
on the source water TDS that may either be below, within or above 
the optimal range. 
≡Organic and inorganic contaminants are unwanted. We consid -
ered the overall potential of the technologies to act as barriers to-
wards pesticides and heavy metals. 3.2. Technologies for centralised drinking water softening 
Technologies for full-scale drinking water softening falls into three 
types depending on the mechanism for hardness removal (Fig. 2): 
≡Precipitation technologies: hardness ions are removed as solid min-
erals due to precipitation  
≡Ion exchange technologies: hardness ions are exchanged with other 
ions (counter ions) into the water  
≡Membrane separation technologies: hardness ions are separated 
from the water using semi-permeable membranes 
The technologies can be further subdivided within each mechanism: 
Precipitation can e.g. be divided into pellet softening and lime/soda-ash 
softening (Fig. 2). Different choices of precipitation chemical, type of ion 
exchange resin and type of membrane form the softening technology. 
The treatment process and design affects the reactions for hardness 
removal and accordingly the final water quality in terms of e.g. addition 
of ions due to chemical addition (Table 4). 
The chemical reactions reflect the main reaction for hardness 
removal and parameters directly related to hardness removal, but the 
overall changes of the water quality also depend on the process design, 
chemical equilibria limitations, membrane type, other ions precipitating 
with CaCO 3 etc. (Tang et al., 2019a ; van der Bruggen and Vandecas -
teele, 2003 ; van Dijk and Wilms, 1991 ). Consequently, the chemical 
reactions in Table 4 only predict the major changes to water quality 
actually observed in full-scale softening. 
3.3. Changes to water quality parameters 
To evaluate the changes to the selected indicators (Table 3) in the 
third step of our framework (Fig. 1), we included changes to water 
quality observed in (i.e. from chemical water analyses) pilot-scale and 
full-scale drinking water softening in literature (Supporting Information 
A). Literature reporting of changes to water quality varies depending on 
the softening technology (Fig. 3). 
In the precipitation technologies and weak-acid cation exchange, 
limitations in chemical equilibria or the process design itself establishes 
a de facto achievable minimum concentration (Fig. 3). For instance, if 
pH is too high in pellet softening, CaCO 3 will precipitate in the water 
phase (homogenous nucleation) and not onto pellets, resulting in a 
minimum achievable concentration (van Dijk and Wilms, 1991 ). 
In membrane separation the removal of ions is typically quantified 
by the “rejection ”, which is the percentage removal from the feed/ 
influent water stream (Table 3). The removal of ions by membrane 
separation depends on e.g. the membrane characteristics and feed water 
composition (Shahmansouri and Bellona, 2015 ). Particularly nano-
filtration membranes are highly selective and rejects divalent ions to a 
higher degree than monovalent ions (Nasr et al., 2013 ). Consequently, 
the reported rejections for a single water quality parameter may vary 
from case to case. 
In ion exchange, ions released from the resin into the water (i.e. 
counter ions) are added to the water in molar concentrations equivalent 
to the ions adsorbed to the resin (Clifford, 1999 ; Holl and Hagen, 2002 ). 
Ions are also added to the water in the precipitation technologies in 
concentrations equivalent to the chemical dosage (de Moel et al., 2006 ). 
We report equivalent effects on water quality parameters as the molar 
change based on either the softening depth (Xsoftening depth) or chemical 
dosage (Xchemical added). 
3.3.1. Hardness removal 
Some of the included softening technologies remove total hardness, 
whereas others only remove carbonate hardness. Hu et al. (2018) re-
ported a Ca2removal efficiency of 90 % in a new pellet reactor design 
circulating the water and concluded that it was more efficient than the 
full-scale pellet softening in the Netherlands reported by Hofman et al. C. Tang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Water Research 203 (2021) 117439
5(2006) that removed about 50 % of the Ca2. Hu et al. (2018) softened 
water with a relatively high temperature (18-21•C), which increases 
CaCO 3 precipitation (van Schagen et al., 2008 ), and did not consider 
that removal in conventional Dutch pellet reactors also was limited by 
targets set for minimum Ca2in the effluent (Hofman et al., 2007 ). This 
example illustrates the importance of reporting water quality changes in 
transparent and comparable manners. 
Nanofiltration, reverse osmosis and strong-acid cation exchange 
remove nearly all hardness from drinking water. In practice, a water 
stream is typically by-passed the softening process and is mixed with the 
softened water to reach the target hardness. Lime/soda-ash softening 
can be operated at higher pH (F10.8) than pellet softening and can 
consequently remove Mg2as Mg(OH) 2 in addition to Ca2(Benefield 
and Morgan, 1999 ; Hammer and Hammer, 2008 ). For water types with 
high Mg2hardness, it may not be possible to achieve the desired soft-
ening depth with the precipitation technologies operated at pH D10.8. 
In weak-acid cation exchange, the regeneration frequency, and thereby water consumption, increases with increasing softening depth, which 
limit the feasible softening depth. 
3.3.2. Effects on pH, alkalinity and temperature 
The softening technologies may reduce, increase or have no effect on 
pH, and decrease or have no effect on alkalinity (Table 6). None of the 
technologies affect the water temperature. pH increases during lime/ 
soda-ash softening and pellet softening due to the addition of a chemi -
cal base, although the removal of Ca2as CaCO 3 partially decreases pH 
(Table 4). When Ca2is removed as CaCO 3, CO32 is removed from the 
water, which reduces the alkalinity. Depending on the softening chem -
ical, HCO 3 and Ca2are removed in a 1:1 or 2:1 molar ratio (Table 4). 
Thus, use of Ca(OH) 2 as the chemical base would maximize the removal 
of HCO 3 , and use of Na2CO3 would avoid HCO 3 removal if necessary. 
CO2(g) is not rejected by reverse osmosis and nanofiltration mem-
branes, resulting in pH reduction. Alkalinity is nearly completely 
removed during reverse osmosis and partially removed by nanofiltration

6(Table 6). 
In weak-acid cation exchange, Ca2and Mg2are exchanged with 
Hthat is removed from the water with HCO 3 as CO2. The removal of 
CO2 from the water increases pH and decreases the alkalinity (Holl and 
Hagen, 2002 ). On the other hand, strong-acid cation exchange has no 
influence on neither pH nor alkalinity (Clifford, 1999 ). 
3.3.3. Effects on other ions (Na, K, Cl , F and SO42 ) 
The WHO has not recommended guideline concentrations for Kor 
SO42 due to a low risk towards human health at concentrations typi-
cally observed in drinking water (WHO, 2017 ). Consequently, removal 
of Kand SO42- from drinking water has only little attention in 
literature. 
Some ions can crystallize with CaCO 3 during precipitation and can be 
removed from the water together with hardness, whereas others, typi-
cally not forming carbonate minerals, remain in the water (Tang et al., 
2019a ). Tang et al. (2019a) observed D4 % removal of Kduring pellet 
softening with NaOH. We were unable to find data for the other pre-
cipitation technologies, but expect comparable results due to the similar 
mechanisms. During pellet softening with NaOH and soda-ash softening, 
Nais added to the water in concentrations equivalent to the chemical 
dosage (Table 7). The Naguideline concentration can be exceeded if 
the Nain the source water is high, which can limit the chemical dosage, 
and thereby softening depth, or need for alternative technologies or 
process design. 
Lime softening is reported to partially remove F as calcium fluoride 
(CaF 2). Due to the high solubility of CaF 2, the theoretical minimum 
concentration of F after softening is 7.5 mg/L (Ayoob et al., 2008 ), 
which is above the maximum guideline of 1.5 mg/L (WHO, 2017 ), and 
thereby not relevant for evaluation of the effects on dental caries 
expressed by DMF-S. 
Na, K, Cl and F are monovalent ions that are nearly completely 
removed by reverse osmosis and partially removed by nanofiltration 
(Table 7). The removal depends e.g. on the feed water composition. E.g., 
Nasr et al. (2013) observed decreased F removal in nanofiltration with increasing Ca2feed concentrations, indicating that F removal is 
reduced in hard water types. SO42 is divalent and can be nearly 
completely removed by both nanofiltration and reverse osmosis 
(Table 7). 
In strong-acid cation exchange, Nais exchanged from the resin into 
the drinking water, increasing the concentration in a 2:1 molar ratio 
with the divalent ions Ca2and Mg2(Berrios et al., 2014 ). No anions 
are removed from or added to the water during the process (Table 7). If 
weak-acid cation exchange is combined with strong-base anion ex-
change, anions are also removed with hardness. The strong-base anion 
exchange resin has higher affinity for divalent SO42 compared to 
monovalent NO3 and Cl . Thus, the removal of NO3 and Cl is 
reduced at high SO42 concentrations (Holl and Hagen, 2002 ; Kapoor 
and Viraraghavan, 1997 ) 
3.3.4. Effects on organic and inorganic contaminants 
Groundwater and surface water can contain various organic and 
inorganic contaminants which are harmful to human health and must be 
removed from the water (Rosborg and Kozisek, 2019 ). Removing the 
contaminants with water hardness in a single process step can be 
desirable from an economic perspective (van der Bruggen et al., 2001 ). 
Both nanofiltration and reverse osmosis can reject organic contam -
inants, but the removal efficiency is complex and depends both on the 
compound, the water composition and the membrane characteristics 
(Bellona et al., 2004 ). Thus, the membrane type should be carefully 
selected for removal of the target compound (Plakas and Karabelas, 
2008 ). Nanofiltration membranes are especially promising for removing 
organic contaminants together with water hardness and can be designed 
to remove organic compounds, but only partially remove water hardness 
to avoid remineralization after the process (van der Bruggen and Van-
decasteele, 2003 ). 
An investigation of removal of 12 pharmaceuticals and three oes-
trogens during pellet softening revealed only little removal of the 
pharmaceuticals (D5.7 %), whereas the highly hydrophobic oestrogens 
were removed by 57-60 %, most likely due to sorption onto the pellets 
Fig. 3.Conceptual drawing of changes to water quality as a result of softening. Changes can be to a minimum concentration, a percent removal or equivalent 
removal and addition of ions. C. Tang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Water Research 203 (2021) 117439
7(Maeng et al., 2016 ). This indicates that organic compounds may be 
removed during pellet softening due to sorption, but otherwise remain 
in the water. Similarly, lime softening has only limited removal of 
organic compounds compared to membrane softening (Bergman, 1995 ), 
with sorption and potentially co-precipitation being the main mecha -
nisms for removal (Liao and Randtke, 1986 ). 
Softening technologies that combine weak-acid cation exchange and 
anion exchange can potentially remove organic compounds, since 
anionic resins are known to remove organic contaminants (Hsu and 
Singer, 2009 ). However, the effects on specific compounds are 
unknown. 
Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis may remove heavy metals such as 
arsenic (Choong et al., 2007 ) from drinking water together with hard-
ness. The removal of a specific ions depends on e.g. the membrane type, 
pH as well as operating conditions such as trans-membrane pressure and 
crossflow velocity (Choong et al., 2007 ). Lime softening can be adapted 
to also remove arsenic from the water, but requires the addition of 
chlorine for oxidation of arsenic and pH F10.5 (Choong et al., 2007 ). In 
pellet softening carbonate forming ions (e.g. nickel, iron and strontium) 
were partially removed, whereas ions not forming carbonates (arsenic 
and potassium) were not removed (Tang et al., 2019a ). Ion exchange can 
remove other ions than hardness and has higher affinity for multivalent 
than monovalent ions (Barrios et al., 2008 ). If the resin has high affinity 
for a specific ion, it may decrease the efficiency of the regeneration 
process (Snoeyink et al., 1987 ). 
3.4. Effects on water quality indicators 
The influence of softening technologies on the selected water quality 
indicators was evaluated from the observed changes to the water quality 
parameters (Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7) in the fourth and final step of 
our framework (Fig. 1). The evaluation of each indicator is available in 
the Supporting Information B. The evaluation included only the overall 
effect on the indicators and not absolute and relative changes, since this 
depends on the specific water type and process design. For example, the 
Larson Ratio calculated from the concentrations of Cl , SO42 and 
HCO 3 should be as low as possible to avoid corrosion in steel pipes and 
installations (Table 3). Increasing concentrations of Cl and SO42 in-
crease the Larson Ratio, thereby affecting the indicator adversely, 
whereas increasing HCO 3 decrease the Larson Ratio, and subsequently 
the corrosion potential. Lime softening and pellet softening do not affect 
SO42 or Cl (Table 7), but reduce HCO 3 (Table 6) and will conse -
quently increase the Larson Ratio, which is an overall adverse effect 
(Table 8). Soda-ash softening and strong-acid cation exchange have no 
effect on HCO 3 , SO42 and Cl (Table 7 and Table 6) and thus no effect 
on the Larson Ratio. Finally, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis and weak- acid cation exchange can remove both SO42 , Cl and HCO 3 from 
the water. Consequently, the overall effect on the Larson ratio depends 
on the specific water type and process design, and is therefore indecisive 
(Table 8). 
CCPP depends highly on pH (Tang et al., 2021 ), and in practice 
nanofiltration and reverse osmosis reduces pH (and thereby CCPP) 
which often result in undesired, negative CCPP values, requiring 
post-treatment (e.g. Mets amuuronen et al., 2014 ; Tang et al., 2019b ). 
Thus, even though CCPP is reduced, the negative values often require 
post-treatment and it would be misleading to categorize them as an 
overall positive effect. To avoid this, we did not include pH in the 
evaluation of CCPP. 
The precipitation technologies tend to affect indicators similarly, 
independent of the technology (Table 9). Lime and soda-ash softening 
can potentially remove Mg2and thereby adversely affect the risk of 
cardio-vascular diseases, which is not affected by pellet softening. The 
precipitation technologies all increase the Larson Ratio and hence have 
an adverse effect on steel corrosion, but a positive effect on both Cu and 
Pb release that are decreased (Table 9). Thus, the distribution system 
materials should be considered when designing a softening process 
based on precipitation. 
All softening technologies have positive effects on soap use (hardness 
reduction), the potential for lime scaling (CCPP reduction) and atopic 
eczema (Ca2removal), but potentially adverse effects on dental health

8(DMF-S) (Table 9), which is mainly due to the removal of Ca2. 
The membrane separation processes remove many different ions, but 
the specific removal may vary, and consequently, it was not possible to 
predict the effects on steel corrosion (Larson Ratio), Pb-release, Cu- 
release or taste. The membrane technologies have adverse effects on 
cardiovascular diseases due to Mg2removal (Table 9). 
The ion exchange technologies are based on the same mechanism, 
but affect the water quality indicators differently. Strong-acid ion ex-
change only affects a few ionic species resulting in no effect on the three 
corrosion indicators (Table 9). The effects from weak-acid cation ex-
change on the corrosion indicators were indecisive. 
The softening technologies affect the remaining indicators differ -
ently, illustrating that the effects on the overall water quality is tech-
nology specific. Furthermore, none of the softening technologies have a 
positive effect on all of the included indicators, indicating that the 
softening technology choice must balance adverse and positive effects. 
4.Discussion 
Nowadays, softening is often implemented to increase consumer 
convenience by reducing lime scaling and soap use in households. We 
found that all the technologies reduce lime scaling (expressed by the 
CCPP) and soap use (expressed by hardness), but also alters the overall 
mineral composition of water affecting corrosion, health and taste pre-
dicted by indicators. We included eight indicators as well as taste and contaminant removal, but further indicators may be relevant to include, 
depending on e.g. the water type, distribution pipe materials and na-
tional standards for evaluating water quality. An evaluation of a broad 
spectrum of water quality indicators provided information on both 
positive and adverse effects from softening, which can support decisions 
when designing the softening process. To our knowledge, such frame -
work has not previously been provided. 
The evaluation of softening technologies using water quality in-
dicators can be further improved by:  
≡Quantify indicators for each specific case: We considered the 
overall positive or adverse effects from the softening technologies on 
the selected indicators. In practice, the indicators should be calcu -
lated based on the actual water type in question to compare the 
absolute effects from each technology. If possible, the indicators 
should be compared to targets that water quality managers may set 
for each case.  
≡Consideration of the entire treatment train: We evaluated the 
softening technologies as isolated units. However, in practice the 
softening technologies are part of a treatment train consisting of also 
e.g. filtration, aeration and pH adjustment that also affect the min-
eral composition of the drinking water (Tang et al., 2019b ). More -
over, pre- and post-treatment may be necessary before and after 
softening to e.g. remove ionic species that can foul the softening unit 
or adjust pH after softening (Berrios et al., 2014 ; Tang et al., 2019b ). 
The effects experienced in the distribution networks and by the 
consumers depend on the water quality leaving the drinking water 
treatment plant, which should form the basis when predicting the 
effects in specific cases. 
≡Better understanding of relations between indicators and con-
sequences: Indicators are not perfect representations of the conse -
quences they predict. For instance, corrosion covers a range of 
complex chemical and physical processes that are difficult to predict 
(Loewenthal et al., 2004 ). Likewise, the relationship between mag-
nesium and cardio vascular diseases is not fully understood (WHO, 
2017 ), resulting in only indicative suggested concentrations (Ros-
borg and Kozisek, 2019 ). We suggest that future research focus on 
the understanding between theoretical indicators and the phenom -
ena they predict. Implementation of softening will especially benefit 
from improved understanding of the relationship between CCPP and 
lime scaling to maximize the positive effects from softening (Tang 
et al., 2021 ). 
Historically, water treatment technologies have been evaluated 
based on technical and economic aspects, but nowadays environmental Table 8

9and societal effects are increasingly considered as well (Hamouda et al., 
2009 ). Evaluation of eight water quality parameters commonly 
measured in drinking water in addition to water hardness (alkalinity, 
pH, temperature, SO42 , Cl , F , Naand K) allowed for a broad 
evaluation of effects on corrosion, health and taste contributing to better 
understanding of softening in an overall systems perspective. Our 
framework can be expanded with economic, environmental, technical 
and societal indicators already used for decision support to further 
optimize the implementation of softening. Water utilities can use this 
systematic approach and overview to make informed decisions, weight 
positive and adverse effects from softening, and justify the choice of 
softening technology to consumers and other stakeholders. 
5.Conclusions 
We evaluated the effects from centralized softening technologies on 
selected water quality indicators within soap use (hardness) and lime-
scale (CCPP), corrosion (Larson Ratio and predicted Pb and Cu release), 
health (DMF-S, Ca2and Mg2), taste and the removal of contaminants 
using existing water quality indicators, and conclude that:  
≡Softening technologies can be divided into three types, depending on 
the hardness removal mechanism that determines the changes to the 
overall water quality and whether hardness can be fully or only 
partially removed from the water: Precipitation (lime, soda-ash and 
pellet softening), membrane separation (nanofiltration and reverse 
osmosis) and ion exchange (strong-acid and weak-acid cation ex-
change) technologies.  
≡All the included technologies have a potential positive effect on 
hardness reduction, CCPP and atopic eczema, but potential adverse 
effects on dental carries (expressed by DMF-S), due to reduction of 
the Ca2concentration. The technologies are expected to have an 
overall adverse effect on the water taste, except reverse osmosis and 
weak-acid cation exchange where it depends on the specific water 
type and softening depth.  
≡The precipitation technologies have a positive effect on predicted Cu- 
and Pb-release, but an adverse effect on steel corrosion expressed by 
the Larson ratio. Membrane separation and weak-acid cation ex-
change can have either an adverse, no or positive effect on the 
corrosion indicators, whereas strong-acid cation exchange is not 
expected to affect the included corrosion indicators.  
≡Both ion exchange and precipitation has the potential for removing 
some heavy metals, but especially membranes can potentially 
remove organic and inorganic contaminants thereby providing 
softening and contaminant removal in a single process step. 
None of the included softening technologies result in only positive 
effects on the included water quality indicators. Better understanding of 
potential adverse effects from softening allows for planning of preven -
tive measures. Water utilities can use our framework to balance the positive and adverse effects from softening, and thereby optimizing 
decision support and the implementation of softening.
