As part of the radioiodinated 4-amino- N-1-[3-(4-ﬂuorophenoxy)-
propyl]-4-methyl-4-piperidinyl]5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide
(123I-R91150) characterization study, ketanserin challenges
were performed on healthy volunteers with the aim of assessing
the speciﬁcity of123I-R91150 binding to subtype 2A of the
5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT 2A), the sensitivity of123I-R91150
SPECT in measuring ligand displacement, the relationship be-
tween ketanserin plasma concentrations and123I-R91150 dis-
placement, and the suitability of the cerebellum as a reference
region for quantiﬁcation. Methods: Dynamic SPECT was per-
formed on 6 healthy men (mean age 6SD, 21 60.89 y) from
the time of123I-R91150 injection until 470 min afterward. Ketan-
serin was administered intravenously at 210 min after injection at
3 doses: 0.1 mg/kg ( n52), 0.05 mg/kg ( n52), and 0.015 mg/kg
(n52). Blood samples for measurement of ketanserin plasma
concentrations were drawn. MRI was performed on all subjects
and coregistered to the SPECT data for region-of-interest draw-
ing on cortical regions and cerebellum. The simpliﬁed reference
tissue model (SRTM) was considered the gold standard for quan-
tiﬁcation, and results were compared with those obtained with
the tissue ratio method (TR). The percentage123I-R91150 dis-
placement was calculated with both methods as the percentage
difference between baseline and postketanserin scans. Results:
Depending on the cerebral regions with the maximum ketanserin
dose studied, SRTM and TR mean displacements were 57.1%–
95.4% and 71.9%–101.2%, respectively, for the 0.1 mg/kg dose;
51.7%291.4% and 56.7% 2102.8%, respectively, for the 0.05
mg/kg dose; and 7.7% 254.5% and 13.8% 247.0%, respec-
tively, for the lowest dose, 0.015 mg/kg. A good correlation
was found between the 2 methods. No ketanserin-induced dis-
placement was observed in the cerebellum time–activity curves,
supporting the use of the cerebellum as a reference region. The
relationship between displacement and ketanserin plasma con-
centration ﬁt with a rectangular hyperbola, with a 5.6 ng/mL con-centration associated with 50% of the maximum displacement
(EC 50). EC 50values calculated using occupancies derived both
with SRTM and with TR were in good agreement. Conclusion:
123I-R91150 SPECT is sensitive enough to measure ketanserin
dose-dependent displacement in cerebral regions rich in 5-HT 2A
receptors. These results support the selectivity of123I-R91150
for 5-HT 2Areceptors and its use as a SPECT ligand for measure-
ments of drug-induced 5-HT 2Areceptor occupancy in humans.

(4-ﬂuorophenoxy)propyl]-4-methyl-4-piperidinyl]5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide (
123I-R91150) ( 1). The speciﬁcity of
123I-R91150 binding to the 5-HT 2Areceptor site has pre-
viously been suggested by preclinical displacement studies.
123I-R91150 displacement induced by the potent 5-HT 2A
antagonist ketanserin has been reported in both dogs ( 2)
and baboons ( 3), with lack of effect of the selective do-
pamine D 2receptor antagonist raclopride in the latter ( 3).
However, experience with the effects of ketanserin on123I-
R91150 binding in humans is limited. Preliminary resultsshowed full
123I-R91150 displacement in cortical brain
regions, with no effect on cerebellar uptake in 3 healthyvolunteers at a ketanserin dose of 0.1 mg/kg ( 4), which was
previously found to be a saturating dose in primates ( 5).
The present study was part of the
123I-R91150 character-
ization study ( 1). Ketanserin challenges at different doses in
healthy volunteers were used to assess the speciﬁcity of123I-
R91150 binding to 5-HT 2Areceptors, the sensitivity of theReceived Dec. 27, 2005; revision accepted Mar. 1, 2006.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Six men (mean age 6SD, 2160.89 y; range, 20 222 y) deter-
mined through the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV to be
healthy were enrolled in this study. None had a history of psychiatrictreatment or signiﬁcant medical events. None was taking psychotro-
pic drugs or other relevant medication. Absence of illegal drug abuse
was assessed by questioning and supported by urine drug screening(InstaCheck Drug Screen Test; Applied Biotech/Forefront Diagnos-
tics). Subjects had to withdraw from caffeine and alcohol 24 h before
the study day and were not allowed to take any drugs during the 7 dbefore the study day. All had normal ﬁndings on physical examina-tion, 12-lead electrocardiography, clinical chemistry, and hematol-
ogy. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committees and the
Spanish Ministry of Health, and written informed consent wasobtained from all subjects before inclusion in the study.
Synthesis of
123I-R91150
The synthesis of123I-R91150 was previously described ( 1,6).
Brieﬂy: 4-amino- N-[1-[3-(4-ﬂuorophenoxy)propyl]-4-methyl-4-
piperidinyl]-2-methoxybenzamide (40 mg) was dissolved in gla-
cial acetic acid (300 mL). The addition of Na123I (3702740 MBq)
and H 2O2(30% solution, 100 mL in 4 steps, 25 mL each) yielded
123I-R91150. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 mL of a 0.5 mol/L
solution of sodium sulﬁte in a 4.5 mol/L solution of NaOH, and
the mixture was puriﬁed by high-performance liquid chromatog-raphy. The collected
123I-R91150 fraction was further diluted with
an isotonic citrate/acetate buffer (end pH, 6.0 26.4), ﬁltered through
a Millex-FG ﬁlter (Millipore), stabilized with a trace of o-iodo-
hippuric acid (1 mg/mL of diluent), and autoclaved. The speciﬁcactivity of the autoclaved
123I-R91150 was approximately 300
TBq/mmol. Radiochemical purity at the time of administration
(i.e., 24 h after synthesis) was higher than 96%.
Subject Preparation and SPECT Procedure
SPECT was performed using a 3-head Prism 3000S camera
(Philips) ﬁtted with ultra-high-resolution fanbeam collimators.The preparation of each subject included administration of po-tassium perchlorate (8 mg/kg) up to 20 min before the
123I-
R91150 injection to minimize exposure of the thyroid gland to
radiation. Four multimodality SPECT/MRI markers (MM3003;IZI Medical Products Corp.), each ﬁlled with approximately 0.074
MBq of
123I, were ﬁrmly attached to the subject’s head at the level
of the mastoids and the corners of the eyes. A dynamic scansequence of one 10-min, four 30-min, three 10-min, and three
40-min frames was acquired starting at 0, 11, 71, 120, 180, 210,
220, 230, 330, 400, and 470 min after injection. Ketanserin wasadministered at 210 min after injection in a slow intravenous injec-tion (over 30 s) at 3 different doses—0.1, 0.05, and 0.015 mg/kg—
each administered to a different subgroup of 2 subjects. The
subjects were allowed to rest outside the SPECT camera duringbreaks between scans until the time of the ketanserin injection;
then, for safety reasons, the subjects rested lying on the SPECT
bed with continuous monitoring of electrocardiography, bloodpressure, and heart rate until the end of the scanning session.Ketanserin Analysis
Blood samples for analysis of ketanserin levels were drawn at
180, 230, 270, 330, 400, and 470 min after the
123I-R91150 injection
and were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm and 25 /C176C to separate
the plasma. Plasma samples were analyzed for ketanserin using a
validated analytic method based on protein precipitation, followed
by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis. The limit of detection for ketanserin
was 1 ng/mL, using a 300- mL aliquot of human plasma with a higher
limit of quantiﬁcation, 100 ng/mL. Quality control samples, pre-pared at 3 different analyte concentrations and stored with the study
samples, were analyzed with each batch of samples against sepa-
rately prepared calibration standards. For the analysis to be accept-able, no more than one third of the quality control results were todeviate from the nominal concentration by more than 15%, and at
least 50% of the results from each quality control concentration
were within 15% of nominal.
123I-R91150 Plasma Analysis
A total of 17 venous blood samples were collected manually from
all subjects, at 21 (baseline), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 71, 120,
180, 230, 270, 330, 400, and 470 min after injection. Plasma analysis
of123I-R91150 was previously described. Brieﬂy: Samples 2 217
were centrifuged at 2,000 gfor 4 min, and plasma and residue
fractions were counted in a g-counter. For determination of the
metabolite proﬁle, 1 mL of pure acetonitrile was added to the plasmafraction, and after centrifugation (2,000 g,4 min), the supernatant
was separated and evaporated at 40 /C176C under a continuous ﬂow of
helium, and the residue was diluted in 100 mL of mobile phase and
injected into the high-performance liquid chromatography system.To the ﬁrst blood sample (extracted before radiotracer injection),
100mLo f
123I-R91150 reference solution ( ;370 kBq/mL) were
added, and the resulting solution underwent the same experimentalprocedure as described for samples 2 217. All samples were
processed within 60 min after they had been collected.
Image Processing
Images were reconstructed using a ﬁltered-backprojection algo-
rithm with a Butterworth ﬁlter (exponent, 5.0; cutoff frequency, 0.4cycle/pixel). Pixel sizes were between 2.45 and 2.51 mm on each
slice and 3.56 mm in the axial direction. Attenuation correction was
performed using the Chang algorithm and a manually ﬁtted ellipticattenuation map on each slice ( m50.1 cm
21). SPECT and MRI
scans were registered using in-house software implemented in C
language. First, the corresponding external markers were manually
identiﬁed on the MRI and SPECT scans. Then, rigid-body trans-formation (3 translations and 3 rotations) was estimated automat-
ically by minimizing the sum of the squared distances between the
corresponding marker positions ( 7).
Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually and individually
by the same investigator on the MR images of each subject. To
control for ROI volumes across subjects, care was taken that ap-proximately the same number of MRI slices was used in drawingthe ROIs for each region across subjects. Moreover, anatomic
landmarks were deﬁned a priori in order to standardize the ﬁrst
(lower) and last (upper) brain slice within which each ROI wasdrawn. ROIs were drawn in the frontal, temporal, occipital, and
parietal lobes and the cerebellum. The frontal lobe was divided into
orbitofrontal, prefrontal, and superior frontal regions, and theoccipital lobe was divided into calcarine and lateral regions.
930 THEJOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE  V ol. 47  No. 6  June 2006Quantiﬁcation of123I-R91150 Displacement
The simpliﬁed reference tissue model (SRTM) ( 8) and the tissue
ratio method (TR) were applied for quantiﬁcation. SRTM was used
as the gold standard for quantiﬁcation, and the cerebellum time–activity curve was used to provide the input function to the kinetic
model. A changing binding potential (BP) value at the moment of
ketanserin injection was included in the model to ﬁt the SRTM toboth parts of the curve, that is, before and after ketanserin. BP before
ketanserin (BP
pre) and after ketanserin (BP post) were the SRTM
outcome measurements. Radioligand displacement measured usingSRTM was compared with the displacement calculated using TR at
pseudoequilibrium. For the TR, speciﬁc uptake ratios (SUR) were
calculated as ([C
reg2Ccer]/Ccer), where C regand C cerwere the mean
counts in the studied cortical region and in the cerebellum, respec-tively. For displacement measures, SUR values from 2 scans were
used: the baseline scan frame at 180 min after injection (SUR
180)
and the scan frame starting at 400 min after injection, that is,190 min after ketanserin administration (SUR
400). This allowed
pseudoequilibrium to be achieved again after ketanserin admin-
istration. Displacement was then calculated as the percentagechange between the BP or SUR values before and after ketanserin:
%Displ
SRTM5100 ·(BP pre2BPpost)/BP pre, and %Displ TR5
100·(SUR 1802SUR 400)/SUR 180.
The relationship between ketanserin plasma concentration and
123I-R91150 displacement in the different ROIs was modeled
according to the Hill equation:
Percentage displacement 5Displmax /C1Cg

where percentage displacement is 5-HT 2Areceptor displacement
(i.e.,123I-R91150 displacement), Displ maxis the theoretic maxi-
mum displacement for the particular ROI, Cp is the ketanserinplasma concentration (and is used as a functional surrogate of the
ketanserin concentration at the synaptic level), gis the slope
factor, and EC
50is the concentration associated with 50% of the
maximum displacement (a measure of drug potency in blocking
5-HT 2Areceptors). Because, in this study, we aimed at character-
izing ketanserin displacement of our 5-HT 2Areceptor ligand, we
decided neither to ﬁx the slope factor to 1 (i.e., to assume that
ketanserin interacts with a single 5-HT 2Abinding site in the brain)
n o rt oﬁ xD i s p l maxto 100% (i.e., to assume that123I-R91150 can be
completely displaced by ketanserin). Nonlinear mixed-effect mod-eling was used as implemented in NONMEM (version 5; Globo-
Max). Because the scan obtained 400 min after injection was applied
for displacement calculations using TR, the ketanserin plasmaconcentrations at 400 min were used to build up the relationship
between displacement and plasma concentration for this method.
RESULTS
Safety
Safety data recorded at the beginning and end of the
scanning session, including heart rate, blood pressure, andQTc intervals, showed that these parameters remainedwithin reference ranges during the entire scanning period.At baseline, the ranges were 100–133 (systolic)/54 269
(diastolic) mm Hg for blood pressure, 371 2416 ms for
QTc, and 55 296 bpm for heart rate. At the end of the
experiment, the respective ranges were 99 2140 (systolic)/
51265 (diastolic) mm Hg, 378 2422 ms, and 52 280 bpm.123I-R91150 Plasma Analysis
The average activities of unmetabolized parent compound
in plasma from venous samples at each ketanserin dose arepresented in Figures 1A (entire study), 1B (0–30 min), and1C (70–470 min). Figures 1B and 1C also present the averagevalues for the 6 subjects. As can be seen in Figure 1B, the 3
curves reached a plateau after a rapid distribution phase.
Activity peaked at 1.5, 1, and 1 min after injection of 0.05,0.015, and 0.1 mg, respectively, of ketanserin per kilogram.The maximum normalized activities were 0.123, 0.032, and0.056 ·10

123I-R91150 K ETANSERIN DISPLACEMENT  Catafau et al. 931ketanserin doses revealed that this fraction dropped from

ﬁnal values of 71% 65%, 81% 610%, and 69% 63% for
0.05, 0.015, and 0.1 mg, respectively, of ketanserin perkilogram. As previously found ( 1), only one species more
hydrophilic than the parent compound (lower retention
time) could be detected in all chromatograms. Coinjection
of the samples with free
123I-iodine showed the same
retention time as for the ﬁrst peak ( ;1.5 min).The fraction of activity in plasma over time (referred to
as total blood activity, average value for 2 venous bloodsamples) showed a quick decrease ( ,10 min), reaching a
plateau of around 80% at 15 min after injection for allketanserin doses.

values of 0.94 (BP prevs. SUR 180), 0.93 (BP postvs. SUR 400),
and 0.88 (%Displ SRTM vs. %Displ TR) (Fig. 2). Depending
on the cerebral regions with the maximum ketanserin dose
studied, SRTM/TR mean displacement ranges were
57.1%295.4%/71.9% 2101.2% for the 0.1 mg/kg dose,
51.7%291.4%/56.7% 2102.8% for the 0.05 mg/kg dose,
and 7.7% 254.5%/13.8% 247.0% for the lowest dose, 0.015
mg/kg. The gradual dose-dependent displacement was alsoseen in all cortical regions (Fig. 3). Independently of thedose or degree of displacement, the behavior of each ce-
rebral region was the same. The highest displacements weremeasured in the superior frontal, prefrontal, and lateraloccipital regions, and the lowest displacements were mea-sured in the orbitofrontal region. The effects of ketanserinon the time course of SUR values are shown in Figure 4.
All subjects showed increasing cortical uptake up to the
ﬁrst pseudoequilibrium time point (180 min after injection),as reported previously ( 1). In all cases,
123I-R91150 cortical
uptake immediately decreased after ketanserin injection at210 min, showing the largest decrease within the ﬁrst 30min. From 210 to 240 min, when the cortical time–activitycurve decreased the most, a small decrease in the slope ofthe cerebellum time–activity curve was observed but was
transient and recovered quickly. Thus, at 270 min after
injection, the slope of the cerebellum time–activity curverecovered to a steady decline indicative of tracer washout,with no indication of tracer displacement (Fig. 5).

123I-R91150 K ETANSERIN DISPLACEMENT  Catafau et al. 933Ketanserin Plasma Concentration and Relationship
with123I-R91150 Displacement
Mean ketanserin plasma levels at the times used for
displacement calculations with TR (400–440 min after
injection of123I-R91150) were 18.9 60.35 ng/mL for the
0.1 mg/kg dose, 9.00 60.27 ng/mL for the 0.05 mg/kg dose,
and 3.60 61.10 ng/mL for the 0.015 mg/kg dose. Given the
limited time over which ketanserin plasma levels wereobserved, no formal pharmacokinetic analysis was run.
The Hill equation ﬁtted the displacement data adequately in
all regions both when the displacement was calculated withSRTM and when the displacement was calculated with TR
(Fig. 6). The model parameters calculated for each region
(Table 2) showed that Displ
maxwas close or equal to 100% in
all regions, indicating that ketanserin can completely displace
123I-R91150. EC 50ranged from 4.2 to 7.1 ng/mL using SRTM
data (population mean, 5.6 ng/mL) and from 3.4 to 6.5 ng/mLusing TR data (population mean, 5.0 ng/mL). Estimates of theHill slope factor were closer to 1 with SRTM data (populationmean, 1.3) than with TR data (population mean, 1.8).
DISCUSSION
This study reports for, what is to our knowledge, the ﬁrst
time the effect of different intravenous doses of ketanserinon cerebral uptake of123I-R91150 in humans. Ketanserin is
a potent 5-HT 2Areceptor antagonist (inhibition constant,
0.38 nmol/L), with less afﬁnity for 5-HT 2Creceptors (inhi-
bition constant, 14.5 nmol/L) ( 10). Ketanserin has also an
afﬁnity for a1-adrenergic receptors and histamine1H re-
ceptors ( 11). Ketanserin lowers blood pressure in patients
with hypertension, likely because of its a1-adrenergic
antagonism. The compound has been shown to be tolerable,
and severe side effects after treatment have not been
reported ( 12). The clinical oral dose for hypertension is
20280 mg/day. The maximum ketanserin doses adminis-
tered in this study were 7.47 and 7.72 mg (subjects 1 and 2,respectively). An intravenous dose of 10 mg has beenreported effective in the treatment of postanesthetic shiv-ering in humans ( 13). The present study showed that large
5-HT
2Areceptor occupancies were achieved even with
subtherapeutic doses of ketanserin. In the preliminary SPECT
study using the 0.1 mg/kg dose as a challenge for123I-
R91150 in humans, no changes were observed in blood pres-sure, temperature, or pulse up to 12 h after administration(4). Similarly, no safety issues were found in the present
study with any of the doses tested. Blood pressure, heartrate, and the electrocardiogram, including QTc interval,were maintained within reference ranges for the entire scan-
ning period.
123I-R91150 Plasma Analysis
The activity corresponding to unmetabolized parent
compound versus time (average value for 9 venous blood
samples) was previously reported ( 1). As shown in the
present work, during the basal state (before ketanserinadministration), results similar to those previously reported(1) were found. Taking into account average values ( n56),
we can state that a peak is found at 1.5 min after injectionand that a quick decrease in activity ending in a plateau isfound at less than 15 min after injection. The activity valueat maximum (1.5 min) was 0.068 ·10
3mL21, which
differs from that previously reported, 0.035 ·103mL21(1).
Variability between subjects at short times has proven to beimportant (Fig. 1A, in which the SD for each group isshown).
One aim of analyzing plasma metabolites in the present
work was to ﬁnd out whether displacement of radioligand
123I-R91150 by ketanserin could be detected as an increase
in the concentration of free parent compound in plasma. As

point. With only 2 subjects included in each group, differ-ences between subjects of the same group were oftengreater than differences between subjects of differentgroups. The expected increase in the concentration of freeparent compound in plasma after administration of ketan-
serin (210 min after injection) is not detected as an increase
in the amount of radioactivity (corresponding to unmetab-olized parent compound) in plasma.Ketanserin-Induced Displacement of123I-R91150
This study found a ketanserin dose–dependent displace-
ment of123I-R91150, supporting the speciﬁcity of123I-
R91150 binding to 5-HT 2Areceptor. A ketanserin dose of
0.1 mg/kg was previously reported to be a saturation dose,
that is, a dose inducing more than 90% displacement, using
18F-altanserin in monkeys ( 5). The present study showed
that this dose induced a123I-R91150 displacement in the
human brain that varied depending on the cortical regionstudied, ranging from 57.1% to 95.4% using SRTM valuesor from 71.9% to 101.2% using TR values. This ﬁndingagrees with the preliminary results of Travis et al. ( 4), who
reported fast and intense displacement of
123I-R91150 to
levels similar to those in the cerebellum in 3 healthy volun-
teers. The present study showed, in addition, intermediate(SRTM, 51.7% 291.4%/TR, 56.7% 2102.8%) and low
(SRTM, 7.7% 254.5%/TR, 13.8% 247.0%)
123I-R91150
displacements induced by, respectively, the subtherapeuticintermediate (0.05 mg/kg) and lowest (0.015 mg/kg)ketanserin doses tested, indicating that the SPECT tech-nique is sensitive in detecting drug-induced occupancy of
the 5-HT
2Areceptor. SRTM was used as the gold standard
quantiﬁcation method because the TR method may intro-duce errors in the determination of displacement. A goodcorrelation was found between displacement measuresusing BP values (SRTM) and displacement measures usingSUR values (TR). This ﬁnding supports the use of a singleacquisition at pseudoequilibrium after bolus injection of
123I-R91150 and quantiﬁcation using TR for measurement
of drug-induced occupancy of the 5-HT 2Areceptor. The
simplicity of this technique makes it suitable for most SPECTcenters and increases patient compliance.
In previous SPECT studies with
123I-R91150 ( 2–4,14 ),
and PET studies of the 5-HT 2Areceptor ( 15–17 ), the cere-
bellum was used as a reference region for quantiﬁcation. Inthis study, a fast and transient decrease in the cerebellumtime–activity curve was observed from 210 to 240 min after
injection, that is, during the ﬁrst 30 min after ketanserin
administration, when the largest decrease in speciﬁc corti-cal binding occurred. This ﬁnding was also reported in abolus/infusion study using
18F-altanserin ( 15), from which
the cerebellum was concluded to be a valid representation

123I-R91150 K ETANSERIN DISPLACEMENT  Catafau et al. 935of free and nonspeciﬁcally bound ligand and brain radio-
labeled metabolites. This conclusion was based on, ﬁrst, thefact that although a small amount of 5-HT
2Areceptor is
detectable by autoradiography, it may be difﬁcult to detectby means of PET/SPECT and ketanserin displacementbecause of the poor statistical quality of the imaging data
and spatial resolution of the images and, second, evidence
that blocking the 5-HT
2Areceptor with unlabeled MDL
100,907 before a PET study did not eliminate the need for a2-tissue-compartment model in the cerebellum ( 18). An
acute and transient effect of ketanserin on cerebellar regionalcerebral blood ﬂow might also be considered. However, suchan effect seems unlikely given that no blood pressure de-crease was detected in any subject studied, and taking into
account the marked decrease in systemic blood pressure
needed to signiﬁcantly decrease regional cerebral blood ﬂow,because of the cerebral autoregulation mechanisms. The low
123I-R91150 uptake in cerebellum and lack of displacement
after ketanserin administration found in this study furthersupport the suitability of using this region as a reference.
Ketanserin Plasma Concentration and Relationship
with123I-R91150 Displacement
The ketanserin pharmacokinetics proﬁle after intrave-
nous injection increased linearly with increasing dose. Thesubtherapeutic dose range explored for ketanserin and theshort pharmacokinetics collection time (less than 5 h) did
not allow for a direct comparison between reported ketan-
serin pharmacokinetics parameters ( 19) and pharmacoki-
netics data from the present study. However, the ketanserinplasma levels found 4 h after injection at the highest dose(approximately 7.5 mg) were in line with the average con-centration measured at the same time point after a 10-mgintravenous injection in healthy subjects ( 19). The Hill
equation used for describing the concentration-displacement
relationship in the different ROIs described the data well,
both using displacement calculated according to SRTM andusing displacement calculated according to TR, with littledifference in ketanserin potency and maximal displacementamong different brain regions. In particular, a 15% 220%
variability in EC
50was observed among different regions,
indicating a fairly homogeneous displacement mechanism inbrain areas expressing 5-HT
2Areceptors. Also, the EC 50
values calculated using SRTM- and TR-derived displacementsagreed well. Differences were less than 20%, with the excep-tion of the calcarine occipital and frontal superior regions.Overall, the major differences between the model parameterscalculated using SRTM and those calculated using TR werein hill slope factor ( g) estimates, supporting the fact that the
concentration-displacement relationship conforms to a rect-angular hyperbola (i.e., interaction with a single binding site)
only for SRTM-derived data.
CONCLUSION
123I-R91150 is a SPECT radioligand speciﬁc for the
5-HT 2Areceptor in the human brain. The ﬁndings of thepresent study demonstrate that123I-R91150 SPECT is sen-
sitive enough to measure ketanserin-induced displacement ina dose-dependent manner and support the use of the cerebel-lum as a reference region for quantiﬁcation. The relationshipbetween displacement and ketanserin plasma concentrationwas well deﬁned, with an EC
50of 5.6 ng/mL based on SRTM
displacement and of 5.0 ng/mL based on TR.
Use of the simpliﬁed method of acquiring a single scan at
pseudoequilibrium after bolus injection of123I-R91150 and
TR produced results comparable to those of using scanningover time and SRTM. Therefore, TR after a single ac-quisition at pseudoequilibrium can be used to measuredrug-induced occupancy of the 5-HT
2Areceptor with123I-
R91150 SPECT.
