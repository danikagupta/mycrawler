ABSTRACT
In this study, the decolorization potential of novel Bacillus sp. DM1 isolated from textile 
effluents was evaluated.  Decolorization of direct red 31 dye was 89% (± 1.20); direct blue 
71 dye was 90% (± 0.84) and direct black 19 dye was 81% (± 0.39) after 24 hours at 100 
ppm concentration. It took 48 hours for nearly complete decolorization of red and blue 
dyes and 72 hours for black dye. Dextrose showed 97% (± 0.91) decolorization of blue dye, 
sucrose 95% (± 1.11) decolorization of black dye and lactose 98% (± 1.35) decolorization of 
red dye. Yeast extract showed 94% (± 0.80) and 97% (± 0.43) decolorization of black and 
red dye respectively, whereas sodium nitrate showed 95% (± 0.73) decolorization of blue 
dye. pH 7 and temperature 350C was found optimum for decolorization of the dyes. 7% 
inoculum size for red and blue dye and 8% for black dye were optimum.

Introduction
Due to rapid industrialization, lots of 
chemicals including dyes are 
manufactured and used in day to day life 
(Moosvi et al., 2005). During the dyeing 
process 2% of these dyes fail to bind to 
the substrate and are discharged in 
aqueous effluents (Ndasi et al., 2011). The 
wastewater from textile when directly 
released in the surface water without 
treatment can cause a rapid depletion of 
dissolved oxygen and lead to a great 
environmental damage (Ramasany et 
al., 2012). Synthetic dyes used most 
commonly in the textile industry for 
dyeing clothes is the major source of 
polluting our water resources. Water 
pollution has been recognized as the 
major hazard of the modern world and is 
one of the main cause of death and 
disease (Pratiwi et al., 2017). Pollution 
caused by dye effluent is mainly due to 
durability of the dyes in wastewater 
(Jadhav et al., 2007). Therefore, the 
removal of dyes from textile effluents is a 
major concern for protection of 
environment. Existing methods for 
decolorization of dyes in waste water 
include pH neutralization, membrane 
filtration, irradiation, ozonation, 
adsorption on activated carbon, 
oxidation, reverse osmosis, 
electrocoagulation, flocculation but 
these methods are inefficient, expensive 
and lead to development of waste in the 
form of sludge which again needs to be 
disposed off (Keharia and Madamwar, 
2003; Ogugbue and Sawidis, 2011). Dyes 
are difficult to degrade because of their 
color fastness, synthetic origin and 
complex aromatic molecular structures which make them stable (Fu and 
Viraraghavan, 2001; Anjaneyulu et al., 
2005). Microbial decolorization and 
degradation of azo dyes has gained 
considerable interest of researchers as it is 
inexpensive, eco-friendly, and produces 
less amount of sludge (Parshetti et al., 
2006). In recent years work has been 
done to isolate microorganisms capable 
of decolorizing textile wastewater (Chen 
et al., 2003; Coughlin et al., 2002; 
Gurulakshmi et al., 2008; Joshi and 
Saxena, 2018; Kalyani et al., 2009; 
Lalnunhlimi and Krishnaswamy, 2016; 
Patel et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2014). But in 
most of the studies the rate of 
decolorization is low and/or the isolates 
take many days to degrade the dye, for 
example, Alcaligenes aquatilis was found 
to decolorize 82% Synazol red 6HBN after 
incubation of 4 days at 37 °C and pH 7 
(Ajaz et al., 2019). Bacillus sp. and 
Pseudomonas sp. have showed 89% of 
decolourization of Orange 3R at 144 h 
followed by 80 and 76% by Salmonella sp. 
and Klebsiella sp., respectively (Ponraj et 
al., 2011). Pseudomonas aeuroginosa has 
been reported to decolorize remazol 
black B from 85 to 94.4% after 5 days 
(Junior et al., 2015). The overall aim of this 
research work was therefore to isolate 
bacterial strains that show high 
decolorization potential and to develop 
a fast, enhanced and cost efficient 
method to degrade dyes released from 
the textile processes.
Material and Methods
Selection of dyes
Direct red 31 (DR 31), direct blue 71 (DB 
71) and direct black 19 (DB 19) dyes,                                             2021 May Edition |www.jbino.com | Innovative AssociationJ.Bio.Innov10(3), pp: 728-740, 2021 |ISSN 2277-8330 (Electronic)Deepti & Monika
widely used for dyeing, were purchased 
from textile industry. For convenience 
common name of the dyes used in this 
study are used. All media and chemicals 
used in the study were of analytical 
grade and purchased from Hi-media, 
India.  Medium with dyes was used as 
control.
Isolation of bacteria from textile dye 
effluent
One ml of each of the textile effluent 
samples from Selaqui Industrial area, 
Dehra Dun were mixed in water blank 
and was then serially diluted from 10-1 to 
10-9. All dilutions were plated on nutrient 
agar media and incubated at 370C for 24 
hours. Morphologically distinct colonies so 
obtained were then streaked on nutrient 
agar medium. Bacterial pure culture was 
maintained in nutrient agar medium 
slants and stored at 4°C and was sub 
cultured every month.
Determination of dye spectrum
Absorption of Red, Blue, Black dyes and 
textile effluent between wavelengths 400-
700 nm were read to determine the 
wavelengths that showed the maximum 
absorbance. Decolorization of respective 
dyes was measured on the basis of 
decrease in absorbance at the 
determined wavelength.
Preliminary screening for dye 
decolorization ability
Liquid culture assayFor liquid culture dye decolorizing 
experiment, sterile nutrient broth 
supplemented with 100 ppm dyes was 
inoculated with bacterial cultures and 
incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. Extent of 
dye decolorization was assessed 
spectrophotometrically and the rate of 
decolorization was calculated using the 
following formula as described by Sani 
and Banerjee, 1999
Characterization of bacterial isolate
Characterization was done on the basis 
of colony morphology in plate, slant and 
broth. For characterization of cell 
morphology simple, gram, acid fast, 
negative and capsule staining was done. 
Indole production, Methyl Red-Voges 
Proskauer, Citrate, Hydrogen Sulfide 
production, Catalase, Oxidase, Amylase, 
Carbohydrate fermentation, Nitrate tests 
were performed for biochemical 
characterization.
Optimization of culture conditions
a. Effect of dye concentration on 
decolorization
Nutrient media was amended with the 
selected dye at a concentration of 25 to 
800 ppm. After different time intervals, 
aliquot (1.5 ml) of the culture media was 
withdrawn, centrifuged and supernatant 
obtained was used for analysis of % 
decolorization spectrophotometrically at 
optimum wavelengths.

b. Effect of time of incubation on dye 
decolorization
Nutrient media with dye concentration 
100 ppm was inoculated with the test 
organism. The culture was incubated for 
96 hours at 37°C. The result of 
decolorization was observed 
spectrophotometrically.
c. Effect of pH on dye decolorization
Nutrient media at different pH (3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, and 9) with each dye concentration 
100 ppm was inoculated with bacterial 
culture at optimum time of incubation for 
each dye. The result of decolorization 
was observed spectrophotometrically.
d. Effect of temperature on dye 
decolorization
Nutrient media prepared at optimum 
conditions, supplemented with dye was 
incubated at different temperatures 
ranging from 25°C to 65°C. The result of 
decolorization was observed 
spectrophotometrically.
e. Effect of carbon and nitrogen sources 
on dye decolorization
Minimal broth medium (KH 2PO 4 2.0, NaCl 
0.5, MgSO 4 0.2, CaCl 2 0.02, (NH 4)2SO4 1.0 
g l-1) was supplemented with 1% 
concentration of carbon and nitrogen 
sources respectively. Peptone, sodium 
nitrate, yeast extract and ammonium 
nitrate were used as nitrogen source. 
Maltose, dextrose, sucrose and lactose 
were used as carbon source. 
f. Effect of inoculum size on dye 
decolorization
Inoculum size ranging from 1% to 10% was 
prepared containing media 
supplemented with bacterial isolate. The result of decolorization was observed 
spectrophotometrically.
Screening for azoreductase
The bacterial cell pellet was suspended in 
0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.5 
w/v Triton-X 100 was added. The mixture 
was incubated at 40C for 30 minutes with 
continuous stirring followed by 
centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 25 
minutes. The supernatant was used as 
crude enzyme extract for the assay. The 
azoreductase assay was carried out 
according to the procedure of Liger et 
al., 2004. The reaction mixture (2 ml) 
contained 35 µM azo dye, 100 µM NADH, 
20 µM FMN, and 2.4 µM of enzyme in 25 
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction was run 
at 30°C, and the decrease in absorbance 
at optimal wavelength for each azo dye 
tested as a substrate was monitored: 
direct red 31 dye at 520 nm, direct blue 
71 dye at 625 nm and direct black 19 dye 
at 620 nm. Total protein was estimated 
using the standard Lowry’s method 
(Lowry et al., 1951). One-unit enzyme 
activity was calculated as one µmole of 
dye reduced per minute. Specific 
enzyme activity was calculated as unit 
per mg.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed in 
triplicates. Results are reported as mean ± 
S.E (Standard Error Mean).
Results and Discussion
Isolation and screening of bacterial 
strains
A total of 13 morphologically distinct 
strains isolated from effluent samples 
were screened for decolorization of the                                             2021 May Edition |www.jbino.com | Innovative AssociationJ.Bio.Innov10(3), pp: 728-740, 2021 |ISSN 2277-8330 (Electronic)Deepti & Monika
dyes. Three showed good decolorization 
activity but eventually one isolate 
showing maximum activity for all the 
three dyes was selected for further 
experimentation. The selected isolate was 
characterized morphologically in agar 
plate, broth and slant followed by 
biochemical characterization. This novel 
Bacillus sp. DM1 showed 89% (± 1.20) 
decolorization of direct red 31 (DR 31) 
dye; 90% (± 0.84) for direct blue 71 (DB 71) 
dye and 81% (± 0.39) for direct black 19 
(DB 19) dye after 24 hours incubation at 
100 ppm dye concentration. The 
absorption maxima of the direct red 31 
dye was found to be 520 nm, direct blue 
71 dye 625 nm, direct black 19 dye 620 
nm and textile effluent 410 nm. 
Preliminary studies showed the necessity 
for optimizing process parameters and 
therefore parameters such as pH, 
temperature, time of incubation, dye 
concentration and inoculum size were 
optimized. Nutritional parameters such as 
carbon and nitrogen sources were also 
optimized.
Optimization of culture conditions 
Textile dye degradation using the isolated 
test organism was optimized under 
different conditions and parameters.
a. Effect of dye concentration on % 
decolorization
The decolorization of all three dyes was 
studied at different dye concentrations 
ranging from 25 ppm to 800 ppm. 
Maximum decolorization was observed at 
100 ppm (Figure 1).
b. Effect of time of incubation on % dye 
decolorizationThe decolorization efficiency of Bacillus 
sp. recorded up to 96 hours of incubation 
showed maximum decolorization at 48 
hours for red (94% ± 0.95) and blue dye 
(96% ± 0.46). Thereafter increasing 
incubation time showed little change in 
decolorization efficiency. Black dye was 
97% ± 0.17 decolorized after 72 hours of 
incubation (Figure 2).
c. Effect of pH on % dye decolorization
The isolate was able to decolorize the 
dyes over a wide range of pH. However, 
maximum decolorization was recorded at 
pH 7 for all the three dyes (Figure 3). 
d. Effect of temperature on % dye 
decolorization
Optimal temperature for decolorization of 
all dyes was 350C. Decolorization rate 
dropped sharply as the temperature 
increased from 350C to 650C (Figure 4). 
e. Effect of carbon sources on % dye 
decolorization
Among the sources studied dextrose 
showed 97% (± 0.91) decolorization of 
blue dye, sucrose showed 95% (± 1.11) 
decolorization of black dye and lactose 
showed 98% (± 1.35) decolorization of red 
dye (Figure 5).
f. Effect of nitrogen sources on % dye 
decolorization
Among the sources studied yeast extract 
showed maximum decolorization of black 
and red dye with 94% (± 0.80) and 97 % (± 
0.43) respectively, whereas sodium nitrate 
showed 95% (± 0.73) decolorization of 
blue dye (Figure 6).
g. Effect of inoculum size on % dye 
decolorization
With inoculum size ranging from 1-10%, it 
was observed that red and blue dye 
showed 95% (± 0.42) and 96% (± 0.26)                                             2021 May Edition |www.jbino.com | Innovative AssociationJ.Bio.Innov10(3), pp: 728-740, 2021 |ISSN 2277-8330 (Electronic)Deepti & Monika
decolorization, respectively, in 7% 
inoculum size, whereas black dye showed 98% (± 1.33) decolorization in 8% 
inoculum size (Figure 7).

Calculation of enzyme activity
Azoreductases are flavoenzymes 
involved in the biotransformation and 
detoxification of azo dyes. The isolate 
showed total enzyme activity 155.32 U (± 
0.01) and specific enzyme activity 8.08 
U/mg (blue dye); 153.18 U (± 0.04) and 
7.97 U/mg (red dye); 148.72 U (± 0.07) and 
7.74 U/mg (black dye). The result is similar 
to a study carried out by Saini et al., 2018 
where Bacillus flexus showed total 
enzyme activity of 154.9 U and specific 
activity of 6.811 U mg-1.  
 Discussion
Our isolate showed a better 
decolorization efficiency as compared to 
the other dye decolorization studies conducted. Junnarkar et al., 2006 
selected a novel bacterial consortium 
that exhibited 90% decolorization ability 
within 35 h. Maximum rate of 
decolorization was observed at pH 7.0, 
incubation temperature of 370C at 200 
mg l-1 concentration of Direct Red 81 dye 
when starch (0.6 g l-1) and casein (0.9 g l-
1) were supplemented in the medium. 
Kumar et al., 2009 reported 98% 
decolorization at 25 ppm concentration 
of dye Remazol Black B after 18 hours of 
incubation at pH between 7-8, 
temperature 30°C at 10% (v/v) inoculum 
and 1% (w/v) glucose concentration. 
Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. isolated 
from the textile effluent showed

of 89% at the end of 144 h under 
optimum conditions with Bacillus sp. 
being the most efficient decolorizer 
(Ponraj et al., 2011). A bacterial 
consortium exhibited 97% decolorization 
in Direct Blue 151 whereas 95% in Direct 
Red 31 within 72 hours at pH 9.5, 
incubation temperature 36℃ at 200 mg/l 
dye concentration with medium 
supplemented with sucrose and yeast 
extract (Lalnunhlimi and Krishnaswamy, 
2016).
Conclusion
The isolated Bacillus sp. showed 
enormous potential to decolorize all the 
three textile dyes studied even at high 
concentration of the dyes and could be 
effectively utilized for treatment of dye 
contaminated textile effluents before 
discharge into environment. The 
decolorization efficiency of this versatile 
strain was found to be enhanced by 
varying pH, temperature, inoculum size, 
carbon and nitrogen sources. In further 
work, genetic makeup of the isolated 
Bacillus sp. can be identified which might 
further be helpful in enhancing the dye 
decolorization efficiency of the isolated 
strain.
