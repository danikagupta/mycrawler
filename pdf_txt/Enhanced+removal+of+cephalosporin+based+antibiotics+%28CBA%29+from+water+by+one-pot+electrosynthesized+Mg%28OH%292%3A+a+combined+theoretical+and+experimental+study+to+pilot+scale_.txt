 Abstract  
The persisting occur rence of ciprofloxacin  (CIP)  and other an tibiotics in our limited water 
resources has fatal health and environmental consequences . This research adopts 
zerovalent iron nano particles (Fe0) as an excellent remedial agent to propose novel iron -
based nanomaterials with unique properties to efficiently remove CIP from water. The 
first project  focused on coating Fe0 nanoparticles with a shell of magnesium hydroxide 
[Mg(OH) 2] to overcome the shortcomings of Fe0 nanoparticles and promote the 
remediation of CIP from aquatic environments. The outcomes of the batch experiments 
demonstrated that encapsulating Fe0 nanoparti cles by Mg(OH) 2 layer with a 
[Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] mass ratio of 5% boosted the removal efficiency of CIP from 41.76% to 
96.31% . Moreover, the optimization process for the treatment parameters revealed that 
CIP-polluted water was optimally treated by Mg/Fe0 nanopa rticles under the following 
conditions: [Mg/Fe0] = 0.5 g L–1, [CIP] = 100 mg L–1, initial pH = 3 – 11, temperature = 
25 ℃, and treatment time = 60 min. Also, t he desorption experiments confirmed that the 
removal of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles was completel y governed by chemical and 
physical adsorption. Furthermore, t he proposed regeneration protocol succeeded in 
recycling Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles for five consecutive treatment cycles with removal 
efficiencies higher than 95%. The second project  aimed to enhance  the reactivity of Fe0 
nanoparticles in eliminating CIP from aqueous solutions by adding the organic ligand 
oxalate. The outcomes of the batch experiments showed that adding 0.3 mM of oxalate 
to Fe0 nanoparticles increased the adsorption of CIP from 45.05%  to 95.74% . Moreover, 
the optimal removal of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles was attained under the 
following circumstances: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L–1, [Oxalate] = 0.3 mM, initial pH = 7, 
temperature = 25 ℃, and treatment time = 30 min. Similar to Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles, the 
desorption experiments emphasize d that the remediation of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles was fully controlled by adsorption instead of oxidation. In addition, t he 
results proved that  adding oxalate  is a cost -effective  approach  to im prove the reactivity 
of Fe0 nanoparticles as the treatment cost of  1 L of CIP -polluted water  notably declined 
from ¥65.716 (Fe0 alone) to ¥29.124 (Fe0/oxalate) . It is important to highlight that the 
performance of Mg/Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles in remediating CIP -polluted 
water are reported for the first time in this study. Also, their outstanding competence is 
promising and has great potential in tackling CIP contamination in actual polluted waters.

Introduction  
   
 2 
 Chapter  1 1.1. Background  
All creatures on earth  need three primary  resources to survive water, soil, and air. Water  
is considered the most crucial element for the sustenance of life on this plant  [1–3]. Szent -
Gyorgyi describe d the significance of water  in life : “That water functions in a variety of 
ways within a cell can  not be disputed. Life originated in water, is thriving in water, water 
being its solvent and medium. It is the matrix of life. ” [4]. Water is widespread in  the 
environment  and forms the lakes, rivers, seas, oceans, and groundwater.  Figure 1.1 
demonstrate s that 97.5% of the hydrosphere  is saline water , leaving only 2.5% of the total  
water on this plant as fresh water s [5,6] . 
 
 
Figure 1.1 Water distribution on earth (Credit: U.S. Geological Survey, Water Science School. 
https://www.usgs.gov/special -topic/water -science -school , Data source: Igor Shiklomanov's chapter "Wor ld 
freshwater resources" in Peter H. Gleick (editor), 1993, Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Fresh Water 
Resources)  
Although it is a small fraction , not all fresh waters are available to be utilized because, as 
shown in Figure 1.1, most of the fresh water s, i.e., 68.7%, are stored in the form of ice 
caps and glaciers , and it is difficult to be recovered and used for our diverse needs  [1,7] . 
While g roundwater , the renewable water resource,  is the second largest portion of fresh 
water ( 30.1%) (Figure 1.1) [6,7] . The sma llest p art of fresh water , e.g., 1.2%,  is 
concentrated in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs  (Figure 1.1) [6]. Man has extensively utilized 
groundwater, surface water, and rainwater, as accessible and available sources of fresh 
water, for household, recreational , agricultural, and industrial purposes [8,9] . However, 
 
 3 
 Chapter  1 most countries  nowadays , especially in arid and semi -arid regions, suffer fro m a severe 
shortage of fresh water due to many causes, for instance, climate change, population 
increase, unwise water consumption, and water pollution [10,11] . The World Health 
Organization (WHO) recently reported that more than 50% of the world’s population will 
live in water -stressed areas by 2025 [12].  
1.2. Water Pollution  
1.2.1.  Definition  
Water pollution  occurs when the quality and composition of water are chang ed by 
introducing foreign and hazardous substances, making  it no longer suitable for any 
application  [13]. Water po llution is a global threat as it intensifies the scarcity of fresh 
water and spreads many acute waterborne diseases, such as  dysentery , giardiasis , typhoid , 
hepatitis , cholera , diarrhea , cryptosporidiosis , and so forth [14]. According to WHO, 80% 
of the diseases are transmitted by water , and more than 2 billion people use drinking water 
sources contaminated with feces  [9]. Furthermore, it is reported that more than 14000 are 
dying daily  because of various waterborne diseases [15]. In addition, The Joint 
Monitoring Programme (JMP) report  declared that at least 2.1 billion people are lake of 
safe drinking water in their homes [16].  
1.2.2.  Types of water pollutants  
A water pollutant is any chemical, physical, or biological matter  that deteriorates water 
quality  or causes detrimental impact s on the aquatic environment and those who consume  
the water [1,15] . Chemical water pollutants can be classified into two groups:  
macropollutants and micropollutants . Macropollutants  are detected in water at mg L-1 
concentrations , such as nitrate (NO ₃⁻) and phosphorous (P)  [10,17] . On the ot her hand, 
micropollutants occur in water  and exert lethal effects at very low concentration s (i.e., μg 
L-1 and ng L-1) [10,18] . Some of the micropollutants are agrochemicals [e.g., pesticides, 
insecticides, herbicides, etc.] , pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)  [e.g., 
antibiotics, hormones , antiepileptic drugs , β-blockers , blood lipid regulators , soaps , 
sunscreens , lotions, fragrances , and so on ], endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)  [e.g., 
diethylstilbesterol (DES) , mycotoxins , bisphenol A ,  phytoestrogens , estrone , etc.], 
perfluorinated co mpounds (PFCs ), surfactants , plasticizers , flame retardants , dyes, 
synthetic fragrances , detergents , radioactive elements [e.g., cesium (Cs+), strontium (Sr),  
 4 
 Chapter  1 uranium (U), and so on .], heavy metals [e.g., Arsenic (As), chromium (Cr),  mercury (Hg) , 
lead (Pb), etc.] and so forth [10,19 –21].  Physical pollutants includ e plastics, suspended 
sediments,  floating debris , heat,  radiation, etc.  [1,22,23] . Whereas  biological pollutants 
include protozoans , pathogens, viruses , worms , and so on [1,23] .  
1.2.3.  Sources of water pollution  
Anthropogenic activities such as  sewage and wastewater,  industrial activities, agricultural 
practices, nuclear energy  and weapons , mining, oil spills, and so on , are the main causes 
of water pollution [23,24] . There are two different sources for water pollution: point 
source pollution and non -point source pollution  [15]. Point source pollution can be  easily 
handled as the source of pollution is known , such as sewer pipe s, septic tank s, wastewater 
treatment plant s, industrial drainage pipe s, etc . [25]. In contrast , non -point source 
pollution is more challenging to be tackled as the source of pollution is unknown , or the 
pollutant s invade the water  from multiple points  [15,26] . Agriculture  is a good example 
of non -point source pollution where agrochemicals can easily infiltrate  groundwater or 
any adjacent water body from infinite locations  [27]. 
1.3. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)  
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are groups of organic compounds 
with distinctive chemical and physical characteristics that are originated to protect human 
lives, improve the daily life of individuals, and help farmers to maintain and en hance their 
agricultural production  [28]. Pharmaceuticals are categorized into many classes in 
accordance with their applications such as antibiotics , hormones, antihypertensives, lipid 
regulators, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and anti -inflammatory drugs  [29]. While  
personal care products can be classified into various groups namely: preservatives, 
fragrances, disinfectants, toothpastes, and sunscreens  [30]. 
1.3.1.  Antibiotics  
Antibiotics are organic chemicals designed to target harmful bacteria without negatively 
affecting the cells and tissues of the host (e.g., human s, animals, fish, etc.) [31]. Numerous 
types of ant ibiotics were developed, after the discovery of penicillin  by Fleming  in 1929, 
to prevent and treat several bacterial infections among humans, animals, and plants 
[32,33] . Antibiotics can be classified according to their route of administration, chemical 
structure, action mechanism, and action spectrum [34]. However, they are commonly  
 5 
 Chapter  1 categorized based on their action mechanism into various classes : aminoglycosides , 
fluoroquinolones , macrolides , β-lactams , glycopeptides , rifamycin , monobactams, 
chloramphenicol , carbapenems , lincomycin, sulfonamides , polypeptides, polyenes, 
tetracyclines, and so forth . [34,35] . Some of these antibiotics are naturally produced in 
the environment , such as tetracyclines and chloramphenicol, whereas some of them are 
chemically synthesized, such as  sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones  [36–38]. 
1.3.2.  The fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin  
Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are synthetic chemotherapeutic agents specifically designed 
to halt the growth of harmful bacteria via inhibiting the main bacterial enzymes such as 
topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase [39,40] . Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a second -generation 
fluoroquinolone antib iotic. It is extensively prescribed in both human and veterinary 
medicine  to prevent the propagation of most gram -negative  bacterial infections and some  
gram -positive bacterial infections  [41–44]. CIP is approved by US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) to treat various bacterial infections such as pneumo nia, typhoid 
fever , prostatitis , anthrax , salmonellosis , urinary tract infections , joint, bone , skin, 
gastrointestinal infections , lower respiratory tract infections , as well as sexually 
transmitted infections ( i.e., chancroid and gonorrhea)  [45,46] . 
1.3.3.  Occur rence and p ossible routes for ciprofloxacin to enter the environment  
Figure 1.2 summarizes  the possible pathways for CIP to enter the environment . Effluents 
of domestic wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are the main anthropogenic source for 
CIP to enter many aquatic environments [47,48] . After being administrated, CIP is 
partially metabolized  in the human body , while  the rest  of CIP  will be excrete d, as parent 
compound s, with its metabolites through feces and urine to the sewer networks and 
eventually reach WWTPs  [49]. Throughout the treatment stages in WWTPs, 80 -90% of 
CIP will be removed via adsorption on the sludge [41,50] . However, t he complete 
elimination  of CIP by  WWTPs is complex  and challenging because CIP is stable and 
highly resistant to degradation  [42]. Consequently , residues of CIP and its metabolites 
will be discharge d with the treated effluents to the nearby water bodies, for instance, 
rivers, lakes, bonds,  sea, ocean, and so on [46,51]. Also, if the treated effluents and the 
sludge of WWTPs are used in agriculture, wide agricultural lands , groundwater , and 
adjacent water bodies will be heavily polluted  by CIP [52,53] . Usually, the detected 
concentrations of CIP in the effluents of WWTPs, groundwater, or surface water range  
 6 
 Chapter  1 from  ng L-1 to μg L-1 [54]. In contrast, a ccording to the statistics presented by  the 
worldwide health communities, the level of CIP pollu tion in hospital and pharmaceutical 
wastewater is much higher than that in municipal wastewater, reaching  around 150 μg/L 
and 50 mg/L released from hospital and pharmaceutical factories, respectively [55,56] . 
Moreover, CIP and other pharmaceuticals might leak from poorly designed 
pharmaceutical landfill sites to pollute the surrounding soil and groundwater [44,57,58] . 
Furthermore, when it is used as foo d additives in food -producing animals, unmetabolized 
CIP will be discharged with feces and urine to pollute the soil of livestock and poultry  
farms [58]. If these animal manures are used as  fertilizers, the agricultural land and the 
underground water will be polluted by CIP [51,59] . 
 
Figure 1.2 Possible pathways for ciprofloxacin to enter the environment.  
Moreover, CIP is still extensively used in aquaculture , where the water of pools will be 
enormously loaded with huge amounts of unconsumed CIP [60]. These waters will  be 
responsible for the pollution of water resources by CIP if  they are not adequately treated 
before being discharged into the environment [61,62] . 
1.3.4.  Heath threats and ecotoxicity of ciprofloxacin  
CIP consumption in medicine is essential  to protect human s, animal s, and plants from 
bacterial infections. However, the frequent occurrence of CIP in water induces the growth 
of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) as well as antimicrobial resistance  bacteria 
(ARB) [63,64] . These genes and bacteria are evo lved enough to tolerate most developed 
antibiotics and can cause incurable infections [65]. The glo bal fatalit ies of A RGs and 
 
 7 
 Chapter  1 ARBs are currently more than 700,000 people  annually  [66]. This figure is expected to 
dramatically increase to 10 mill ion by 2050 if no urgent and serious actions are being 
made to decrease the concentration s of CIP and other antibiotics  in the limited water 
resources  [66]. Furthermore, The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  predicted 
that more than 2 million people in the United States  of America  (USA)  would be infected 
by ARGs and ARBs  every year , and at least 23,000 of them are expected  to die annually 
because of antimicrobial infections [67]. The widespread and persistent pollution  of water 
resources by CIP is a worldwide health and ecological threat, and it is considered by many 
international  organizations, for example , the Global Water Research Coalition (GWRC), 
as one of the top priority contaminants among pharmaceuticals [33,68] . 
1.3.5.  State -of-the-art treatment technologies for ciproflo xacin pollution  
Several treatment technologies were developed over the years to efficiently remove CIP 
from aqueous solutions under different circumstances and conditions  [69,70] . Some of 
these techniques are adsorption  by various adsorbents [e.g., activated carbon (AC), 
biochar, clay minerals, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), graphene oxides, metal -
organic framework s (MOFs), etc.] [71], bioremediation [44,72 –74], ozonation [75,76] , 
chlorination  [54,77] , advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) [78–80], photodegradation  
[81,82] , electrocoagulation  [56,83] , membrane technology (e.g., reverse osmosis (RO)  
[84], ultrafiltration  [85],  and nanofiltration  [86]), ionic exchange [87], and so forth.   
Some of these methods have many disadvantages when it comes to the removal of CIP 
from aquatic environments. For instance, chlorination generates highly toxic byproducts 
during the treatment process , requiring  further treatment steps for these compounds [88]. 
Also, one of the drawbacks of ozonation is the production of very toxic byproducts during 
the treatment process , in addition to the high cost and energy of producing the highly 
poisonous  ozone  [88]. Biodegradation is not efficie nt and time -consuming technology to 
remove CIP because CIP is recalcitrant to biodegradation.  Pan et al.  demonstrated that 
less than 57% of CIP was degraded by Thermus sp. Strain  (C419 ), a thermophilic 
bacterium  isolated from sludge , after five days of inc ubation at a temperature of 70 ℃ 
and initial pH of 6.5 with the addition of sodium acetate [74]. Moreover, biodegradation 
is not a favorable option when the background concentration of organic matter  is high 
compared to the concentration of CIP where the microorga nisms prefer to consume the 
available organic matter  rather than CIP [89]. Membrane technologies have many  
 8 
 Chapter  1 downsides , such as being very expensive, e specially in a large -scale application, high 
energy  consumption, fouling, clogging , and demand for remineralization of the treated 
water  [71,88] . 
1.4. Zerovalent i ron nanoparticles  (Fe0) 
1.4.1.  Background  
Nanotechnology is the science of producing materials in a nanometer scale with particle 
sizes ranging  from 1 to 100 nm. In the early 20th century, Richard Zsigmondy was the 
first to observe nanomaterials by employing an ultramicroscope  [90]. In addition, he was 
the first to describe the particle size with the term ‘nanometer’. Nanotechnology is a  
promising approach that is getting the  attention of many researchers in the field of water 
and wastewater technologies because it has the potential to overcome the limitations of 
traditional treatment technologies and  can meet the strict water regulations. It provides an 
efficient, cost-effective,  and environmentally friendly  solution to treat different 
wastewater streams  such as domestic, agriculture, industrial, hospital , and radioactive 
wastewaters.  Zerovalent i ron nanoparticles  (Fe0) are well-known and  excellent remedial 
nanomate rials for a broad  spectrum of organic and inorganic contaminants and pollutants 
in water , such as nutrients, radionuclides, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals , and personal 
care products (PPCPs), agrochemicals , chlorinates solvents,  halogenated organic 
compound s (HOCs) , etc. [91–93]. It is distinguished by its core -shell structure, 
remarkable adsorption capacity, high surface area and surface reactivity, and strong redox 
potential ( Figure 1.3) [94,95] .  
1.4.2.  Removal mechanisms of organic pollutants by Fe0 nanoparticles  
Fe0 nanoparticles can remove organic pollutants , like CIP, through two different 
mechanisms : adsorption and oxidation  [91]. Adsorption happens on the surface of Fe0 
nanoparticles . In contrast,  oxidation occurs by reactive oxygen species (ROS) , which are 
produced during the corrosion of Fe0 nanoparticles in aqueous solutions.   
Several reactions will happen  when Fe0 nanoparticles get in contact with water and/or 
oxygen. These reactions are highly pH -dependent , and they can be summarized as follows

Fe0 nanoparticles will  react  with oxygen  to release ferrous ions (Fe ²⁺) and formulate  
hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) [Equation (1.1)]. If the circumstances  of the aqueous solution 
are ideal, Fe ²⁺ ions will be oxidized by oxygen to ferric ions (Fe3⁺) and generate  extra 
H2O2 [Equations (1.3) and (1.4)]. Finally, the produced  Fe²⁺ ions and H 2O2 will react with 
each other to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), for instance,  hydroxyl radicals 
(OH•) or/and ferryl ions (Fe[IV] ) [Equation (1.5)]. This reaction is called the Fenton 
reaction , and the generated ROS will be responsible  for the degradation of organic 
pollutants in water.

 Chapter  1 1.4.3.  Defects and improvement techniques of iron nanoparticles  
Despite the superb characteristics of Fe0 nanoparticles , several pitfalls  limit, hinder or 
impair the decontamination competence of Fe0 nanoparticles  in environmental 
applications  (Figure 1.4). Out of these defects, particl e agglomeration, fast surface 
oxidation and passivation, low oxidants yield  [Equation (1.5)], and poor transportability 
in porous mediums [98,99] . Various  improvement and modification techniques were 
employed to overcome these weaknesses  and improve the reactivity of Fe0 nanoparticles , 
such as (I) noble metal  deposition on  the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles  (e.g., Cu, Ni, Ag, 
Au, and Pd ) [100–102], (II) immobilization and deposition of Fe0 nanoparticles on 
various  supporting materials ; for example, activated carbon , biochar , graphene oxide , 
carbon nanotubes , etc. [103–105], (III) stabilization  of Fe0 nanoparticles  with different 
types of polymers and surfactant s [i.e., polyacrylamide (PAM) , polyvinylpyrrolidone 
(PVP), starch , carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC ), guar gum , etc. ] [106–108], (IV) 
encapsulation of  Fe0 nanoparticles  with a shell layer of different materials , for example,  
bismuth,  magnesium hydroxide , sulfide , and so on [63,109,110] , and (V) addition of 
oxidants  such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), peroxymonosulfate , persulfate  (S2O82–), etc. 
[111–113].

 Chapter  1 1.4.4.  Previous  application of iron -based nanomaterials for ciprofloxacin removal  
Several iron -based nanomaterials and nanocomposites were previously used  for 
eliminating CIP from aqueous solutions  [69]. Table 1.1 epitomize s the latest application 
of different iron-based nanomaterials  in remediating CIP from aquatic mediums  under 
various  conditions such as CIP initial concentration (mg L-1), nanomateri al dosage (g L-
1), initial pH of the solution, oxidant concentration (mM), and contact time (min). Each 
iron-based nanomaterial or treatment system was compared  based on the final removal 
efficiency under the optimized treatment  parameters.

de Lima Perini et al.  were the first to use the microscale zerovalent iron particles (ZVI) 
to remove CIP from water [114] . They demonstrated  that 85% of 21.58 mg L-1 of CIP 
was removed by  2.5 g  L-1 of ZVI after 120 min . The unsatisfied perfor mance of ZVI in 
the previous study encouraged Hoa et al.  to enhance the competence of ZVI towards the 
elimination of CIP by adding persulfate (PS) as a strong  oxidant  [Equation s (1.7)-(1.9)] 
[115] . Their outcomes illustr ated that 84.5%  of 9.96 mg L-1 of CIP was removed within 
60 min by only 0.126 g L-1 of ZVI after adding 2.25 mM of PS.  The efficacy of (PS/ZVI) 
is clearly better than the bare ZVI as the required mass of ZVI to treat CIP -polluted water 
was significantly reduced from 2500 mg L-1 to 126 mg L-1. This improvement is attributed 
to the massiv e production of the reactive oxygen species [e.g., s ulfate  (SO 4•⁻) and 
hydroxyl radicals  (OH•)] in the aqueous medium after the successful activation of PS by 
ZVI as shown in the following equations:   
𝑭𝒆𝟎+𝟐𝑯+→ 𝑭𝒆𝟐++𝑯𝟐 (1.7) 
𝑭𝒆𝟐++𝑺𝟐𝑶𝟖𝟐−→𝑭𝒆𝟑++𝑺𝑶𝟒•−+𝑺𝑶𝟒𝟐− (1.8) 
𝑺𝑶𝟒•−+𝑯𝟐𝑶→𝑺𝑶𝟒𝟐−+𝑶𝑯•+𝑯+ (1.9) 
In water and wastewater remediation, zerovalent  iron nanoparticles (Fe0) are more 
reactive and efficient than the micro -sized iron particles (ZVI) . Shao et al.  supported the 
bare Fe0 nanoparticles  with wheat straw (WS -Fe0) to overcome the agglomeration  of Fe0 
nanoparticles  and promote  the removal of CIP from polluted water [116] . They found that  
 14 
 Chapter  1 approximately 85% of 50 mg L-1 of CIP was eliminated by 1 g L-1 of Fe0 nanoparticles. 
On the other hand, the efficiency of Fe0 nanoparticles improved from 85% to around 97% 
after supporting Fe0 nanoparticles by wheat straw ( WS-Fe0). The presence of wheat straw 
during the formation of Fe0 nanoparticles allowed them to be fully  distributed on the 
surface of the wheat straw , which helped in decreasing the degree of agglomeration and 
enhanced the competence of Fe0 nanoparticles in remov ing CIP over a wide range of pH 
(i.e., 4–10). Pirsaheb et al. tried to utilize carbon dots as supporting material for Fe0 
nanoparticles  [117] . However , the modification process couldn’t enhance the reactivity 
of Fe0 nanoparticles as less than 51% of CIP was removed by Fe0 nanoparticles 
encapsulated in carbon dots . 
Table 1.1 shows that m any researchers  chose to improve the reactivity of Fe0 
nanoparticles in treating CIP -polluted water by adding strong oxidants to promote the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and effectively oxidize and decontaminate 
CIP from aqueous solutions. For example , Mon dal et al.  added 100 mM of  hydrogen 
peroxide (H 2O2) to 167.54 mg/L of Fe0 nanoparticle  and accomplish ed 100% removal 
efficiency of 10 mg L-1 of CIP at pH ranges between 6.2 -7.3 [79]. As previously explained 
in section 1.4.2 , the corrosion of Fe0 nanoparticles in water produces H 2O2 [Equation 
(1.2)]. However, the concentration of the produced H 2O2 is insufficient to generate 
enough reactive oxygen species (RO S) to degrade and oxidize organic pollutants in water.  
Thus, the addition of a sufficient amount of H 2O2 (e.g., 100 mM) to  Fe0 nanoparticles in 
aqueous medium s will generate vast amounts of  strong hydroxyl radicals (OH•) according 
to the following reactions  [118] : 
𝑭𝒆𝟎+𝑯𝟐𝑶𝟐→𝑭𝒆𝟐++𝟐𝑶𝑯− (1.10) 
𝑭𝒆𝟐++𝑯𝟐𝑶𝟐→𝑭𝒆𝟑++𝑶𝑯• (1.11) 
These radicals are strong enough to degrade and decontaminate CIP in polluted water s. 
This explains the remarkable performance of H 2O2/Fe0 in removing CIP from water.  Mao 
et al.  employed two modification techniques  to boost the efficiency of Fe0 nanoparticles , 
namely, support of Fe0 nanoparticles with biochar  (BC-Fe0) and add the strong oxidant 
hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) [119] . Despite  using various modification techniques,  less than 
70% of 100 mg L-1 of CIP was removed after the activation of 20 mM of H 2O2 by 0.4 g 
L-1 of (BC -Fe0) nanocomposite under acidic pH (i.e., 3 ~4). Also, Gao et al.  prepared 
sulfide -coated iron nanoparticles supported by biochar (PS/S -Fe0/BC)  to activate PS and  
 15 
 Chapter  1 oxidize CIP in water [120] . Like Mao et al. , the complicated treatment system o f Gao et 
al. failed to completely eliminate 50 mg L-1 of CIP with a removal efficiency of less than 
89.78% . Liu et al.  explored the possibility of activating persulfate by stabilized bimetallic 
Fe/Ni@PGA to produce strong oxidants , for example, sulfate radicals  (SO₄•⁻) and 
efficiently degrade  CIP in aquatic environments [121] . Fe/Ni@PGA  succeeded in 
activating  persulfate under acidic solution (pH = 3) and degrade d around 93.24%  of 100 
mg L-1 of CIP. Conversely, as most of the advance d oxidation processes (AOPs), 
Fe/Ni@PGA  failed to activate persulfate at neutral pH (pH = 5 -7), and approximately 
40% and 20 % of 100 mg L-1 of CIP were eliminated at an initial pH of 5 and 7, 
respectively.  Pirsaheb et al.  [122]  and Rahmani et al.  [123]  combined Fe0 nanoparticles  
with ultrasonication  (US)  and the addition of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate, 
respectively, to efficiently remediate  CIP-polluted waters . The suggested treatment 
system by Pirsaheb et al.  [e.g., (H 2O2/Fe0/aeration/US)] treated  94% of 100 mg L-1 of CIP 
[122] . Whilst the advanced oxidation process pr oposed by Rahmani et al.  [e.g., 
(US/PS/ Fe0)] bar ely remove d 57% of 50 mg L-1 of CIP [123] . On another occasion, 
Pirsaheb et al.  proposed another advanced oxidation process to remediate CIP from 
aquatic mediums based on the activation of hydrogen peroxide by Fe0 nanoparticles with 
the aid of aeration  and weak magnetic field ( Fe0/H2O2/aeration/MF ) [124] .  97% of 100 
mg L-1 of CIP was promptly eliminated within 10 min by activating hydrogen peroxide 
by 600 mg L-1 of Fe0 nanoparticles at neutral pH (i.e., pH = 7) under the influence of 40 
mT of weak magnetic field  (WMF) . Th presence of WMF  improved the efficacy of the 
treatment system via several method s [124] . During the treatment process , the WMF  will 
increase the dissolution of iron to ferrous ions (Fe2+) [Equation (1.1)] and hydrogen 
peroxide , which will allow more radicals to be produced in the system [ Equation (1.5)]. 
In addition, the WMF improves  oxygen solubility and promotes  the release of electrons 
in the system. These electrons will be available to directly react with water and oxygen 
and produce m ore radicals in water. Moreover, the utilization of WMF throughout the 
treatment process extend  the lifespan of the generated radicals  in the system . 
Chen et al.  adopted another approach to modify Fe0 nanoparticles by stabilizing  Fe0/Cu 
bimetallic  nanoparticles  using the soluble polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)  [106] . 
The competence of p olyvinylpyrrolidone  stabilized Fe0/Cu bimetallic particles (PVP -
Fe0/Cu) was further reinforced by the presence of WMF . PVP-Fe0/Cu nanoparticles 
remediated 98.4% of 100 mg L-1 of CIP  within  120 min under the effect of a magnetic  
 16 
 Chapter  1 flux density of 2 mT . In another research article , Chen et al.  utilized the extracts of green 
tea instead of sodium borohydride  as a green reducing agent to synthesize bimetallic GT -
Fe0/Cu nanoparticles  [125] . The green -synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles (GT -Fe0/Cu) 
exhibited a better performance  in treating CIP -polluted waters (Removal efficiency  = 
80%) than th e traditionally synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles ( Fe0/Cu) ( Removal 
efficiency  = 55%). It is important to mention that Chen et al.  also applied GT-Fe0/Cu 
under the influence of a weak magnetic field with a flux density of 5 mT to promote the 
complete removal of CIP from polluted water.  
1.4.5.  The adopted modification technologies for Fe0 nanoparticles in this study  
The previous articles in the literature have confirmed that bare Fe0 nanoparticles can’t  
effectively  eliminate CIP from polluted water due to the complexity of CIP, in addition, 
to the recalcitrance of CIP to degradation. Thus , it can be observed  from Table 1.1 that 
all the previous researchers modified  Fe0 nanoparticles with one or more of the 
improvement  techniques  to develop effective iron -based nanomaterials or iron -based 
treatment  system s for C IP pollution . Table 1.1 demonstrates that some of the developed 
iron-based nanomaterials didn’t accomplish the complete  removal of CIP from polluted 
water despite using single or multiple enhancement methods, for example, ZVI [114] , 
PS/ZVI  [115] , Fe0 nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon dots  [117] , H2O2/BC-Fe0 [119] , 
PS/S-Fe0/BC [120] , and US/PS/Fe0 [123] . Another group of  the proposed iron -based 
treatment systems succeeded in remediating  CIP-polluted water, with removal 
efficiencies of more than 90%, by adding highly toxic oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide 
[79,124]  and persulfate [121] .  The employment of such systems in water and wastewater 
treatment applications is unfavorable because these systems could only operate under 
strong ly acidic conditions (pH < 3). Furthermore, the residues of the utilized oxidants 
after the treatment process will cause secondary pollution , which may require further 
treatment steps before final discharge to the environment.  It is worth noting that Chen et 
al., in both studies  [106,125] , improved the oxidative capacity of p olyvinylpyrrolidone  
stabilized Fe0/Cu bimetallic particles  (PVP -Fe0/Cu) and g reen synth esized bimetallic 
nanoparticles  (GT-Fe0/Cu) via using weak magnetic fields  instead of using toxic oxidants. 
However, the  application of weak magnetic field increases the required energy for the 
treatment process, and consequently increases the overall treatment cost.  Moreover, the 
utilization of magnetic field in open water bodies such as river, lake, bond, etc., is 
challen ging, impractical, or  in some situations impossible.  Also, the use of copper as a  
 17 
 Chapter  1 doping metal in PVP-Fe0/Cu and GT-Fe0/Cu nanoparticles could cause a secondary 
pollution when these nanomaterials are applied in huge quantities in real contaminated 
sites.  
In the light of the previous research articles, more efficient, feasible , simple, 
environmentally friendly, cost -effective,  and energy -saving techniques to enhance the 
reactivity of  Fe0 nanoparticles and efficiently treat CIP-polluted waters  in real 
contam inated sites  are needed . Hence, t his study adopts more environmentally friendly 
approaches to improve the competence and reactivity of Fe0 nanoparticles in remediating 
CIP-polluted waters , namely  coating Fe0 nanoparticles with magnesium hydroxide shell 
and addition of the organic ligan d oxalate to Fe0 nanoparticles.  
1.4.5.1.  Coating Fe0 nanoparticles with magnesium hydroxide shell  
Magnesium hydroxide [Mg (OH) 2] is a non-poisonous  and environmentally friendly 
substan ce used in many  industrial fields  such as the manufacture  of flam -retardant, food 
processing, heritage preservation , paper production, and so forth  [126] . Furthermore, it is 
widely utilized to remove various types of pollutants from drinking water, surface water, 
groundwater , and wastewater [127–130]. During the past years, more than 48,000 tons of 
Mg(OH) 2 have been  used annually  in wastewater treatment  applications  [131] . Mg(OH) 2 
has several  unique  characteristics , for instance , nontoxicity, non -magnetization, cost -
effectiveness, high surface a rea, high stability, low solubility index, and so on. These 
features make Mg(OH) 2 an excellent coating material for Fe0 nanoparticles [132] .  
Recently, Maamoun et al.  demonstrated  that coating Fe0 nanoparticle s with a shell  of 
Mg(OH) 2 remarkably improved the physiochemical properties of Fe0 nanoparticles , such 
as reactivity, dispersity , and mobility [109] . Also, Chen  et al.  illustrated that t he 
aggregation and oxidation of Fe0 nanoparticles were minimized by coating Fe0 
nanoparticles with Mg(OH) 2 layer [129] .  
Mg(OH) 2-coating iron nanoparticles (Mg/Fe0) were appl ied to remove a limited number  
of pollutants, for example, chromium [133] , lead(II) [134] , and uranium(VI)  [129] . 
However, the removal of organic pollutants from water, particularly CIP, by Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles has not been  reported yet. Therefore, this study is the first in the literature 
that exam ines the competence of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in treating CIP -polluted water.   
 18 
 Chapter  1 1.4.5.2.  Addition of the organic ligand  oxalate  
The production of ROS by Fe0 nanoparticles is faint and inadequate  to target complex 
organic pollutants  like CIP , as only less than 7% of the applied  Fe0 nanoparticles can be 
converted  to ROS [135] . The deficiency  of the oxidative  capacity of Fe0 nanoparticles 
may result from various  factors  as follows  [97]: 
1. The high surface energy  of Fe0 nanoparticles favors the formulation  of water  via 
a four-electron transfer reaction [Equation (1.2)] rather than the generation  of 
H2O2 through a two-electron transfer reaction [Equation (1.1)] [136] .   
2. The activation rate of O2 by Fe²⁺ [Equation s (1.3) and (1.4)] under acidic pH is 
negligible and weak at pH below  5, which reduces  the production of H 2O2 and 
superoxide radicals (O 2•⁻) in the  aqueous solution  [137] . 
3. The reaction of Fe0 with H2O will increase  the pH  of th e aqueous medium and 
thus promote the precipitation of Fe3⁺ [Equation (1.6)] and form ulation of  a 
passivation layer of iron oxide and hydroxides on th e surface of Fe0 nanoparticles . 
This layer will preserve the core of Fe0 nanoparticles from corrosion  and restrain 
the interaction with pollutants in water  [135] .  
It is also important to note that the corrosion  of Fe0 nanoparticles [Equation (1.1)] controls 
the kinetics of the subsequent  reactions  [Equations (1.2)-(1.5)]. In other words, besides 
the low generation  of ROS, the oxidation of Fe0 nanoparticles require acidification which 
limits the application of Fe0 nanoparticles to treat organic pollutants  in water  [135] . 
The addition of oxidants to Fe0 nanoparticles, such as  hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) [138] , 
persulfate ( S2O82−) [120] , peracetic acid  [139] , hypochlorous acid  (HClO ) [140] , etc., was 
previously employed  to enhance  the production of ROS by Fe0 nanoparticles. However, 
these chemicals are poisonous , unstable, corrosive, and explosive , which make s their 
application, transportation , and storage in  contaminated locations  challenging and 
dangerous [141,142] . Organic ligands or chelating compounds are considered more 
environmentally friendly alternatives to the toxic oxidants because they can improve ROS 
generation  by Fe0 nanoparticles and pr omote the oxidation of organic pollutants  in water 
[137] . Oxalic acid (OA) is a low molecular weight organic acid (LMWOA) . It is released 
to the soil by plants as one of the components of roots exudates to enhance the 
mobilization of nutrients, e.g., iron (Fe), phosphorous (P), zinc (Zn), cadmium ( Cd), etc.  
 19 
 Chapter  1 [143,144] . Sev eral articles declared  that adding  the organic ligan d oxalate ( C2O42-), the 
salt form of oxalic acid, to Fe0 nanoparticles significantly enhanced  the oxidation of some 
organic compounds and  improved  the removal of certain heavy metals 
[135,137,145,146] .  
The detailed literature review revealed that most of the previous researchers investigated 
the enhanced oxidation of simple organic compounds by (Fe0/oxalate) sys tem, for 
example, phenol ( C6H6O) [146] , methanol ( CH₃OH ) [135] , nitrobenzene  (C6H5NO 2) 
[122] ,  and 4-chlorophenol  (C6H5ClO) [145] . On the contrary, the role and the 
enhancement mechanism of oxalate to promote the removal of antibiotics from aqueous 
solutions, particularly CIP, by Fe0 nanoparticles haven’ t been reported yet.  
1.5. Research aim and o bjectives  
This study aim s to develop and synthesize innovative iron -based nanomaterials for 
efficient and effective remediation of the micropollutant CIP from polluted waters.  
The current study consists of two main research projects . The first project focuses on the 
remediation of CIP -polluted waters by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles . The objectives of the first 
project were  as follows:  
• Synthesis of Fe0 and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in the laboratory through a chemical 
reducti on process.  
• Characterization of Fe0 and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles via several characterization 
instruments to reveal their physiochemical features and confirm the success  of the 
coating protocol.  
• Evaluate the performance of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in treating CIP -polluted water 
under the influence of various parameters such as  [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] mass ratio, the 
dosage of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles (g L-1), initial pH of the polluted water, initial CIP 
concentration (mg L-1), and treatment temper ature ( ℃). 
• Conduct desorption experiments  to distinguish the contribution of adsorption and 
oxidation  in removing  CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles.   
• Perform kinetic s, isotherm , and thermodynamic analysis for the experimental data 
to disclose the nature of the interaction between CIP and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in 
aqueous solutions.   
 20 
 Chapter  1 • Design a regeneration protocol for Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in order to be recycled 
for many treatment processes.  
• Carry out longevity tests on Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles to identify  the proper conditions 
for their transportation and storage in contaminated sites.  
• Propose, for the first time, a prototype tr eatment system based on Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles  to remediate continuous streams of CIP -polluted waters.  
On the other hand, the second project concentrates on evaluating the competence of 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles in eliminating CIP from polluted waters. Sev eral objectives 
for the second project had been set as follows:  
• Identify the physicochemical changes of Fe0 nanoparticles before and after the 
reaction with oxalate in water.  
• Determine the improvement mechanism  of adding the organic ligand oxalate to 
Fe0 nanoparticles towards the removal of CIP from polluted water.  
• Carry out laboratory -scall experiments to systematically optimize the treatment 
parameters of CIP -polluted waters by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles, nam ely oxalate 
concentration (mM), Fe0 nanoparticles dosage (g L-1), the concentration of 
dissolved oxygen, initial pH of the aqueous medium, initial CIP concentration (mg 
L-1), and reaction temperature ( ℃). 
• Implement kinetics, isotherm, and thermodynamic ana lysis for the elimination of 
CIP from polluted water by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles.  
• Examine the impact of natural organic matters (i.e., humic acid), ionic strength of 
polluted water, and coexisting ions (e.g., anions and cations) on the competence 
of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles in treating CIP -polluted water.  
• Inspect the reusability of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles for many treatment cycles.  
• Prepare  cost analysis for the treatment of CIP -polluted  water  by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles . 
1.6. Thesis Outline  
The framework of the Ph.D. thesis consists of five main chapters as follows:  
 Chapter  1 provide s background information about water pollution  by antibiotics , 
particularly the recalcitrant ciprofloxacin . In addition, it discusses the occurrence and fate

 2.2. Synthesis of zerovalent iron nanoparticles ( Fe0) 
Fe0 nanoparticles were synthesized  in the laboratory  using  the chemical  reduction 
technique  [63,147,148] . The concept of this method is based on the chemical reduction 
of diss olved ferric ions (Fe³⁺) to zerovalent iron (Fe0) via potent  reducing agents such as 
sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) . Figure 2.1 shows a schematic diagram for the  synthesis of 
Fe0 nanoparticles  in the laboratory . In detail, o ne gram of Fe0 nanoparticles was produced 
as follows: 5 grams of ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl 3.6H 2O) were  added  to 200 m l of 
deoxygenated deionized water (DDIW)  to prepare the ferric solution  (Fe³⁺) . The term 
deoxygenated deionized water indicates that deionized water was purged by pure nitrogen 
gas (N 2) for 10 min until the oxygen level was lower than one ppm. This step was essential 
to protect the produced nanoparticles from oxidation. Subsequently , 2.2 grams of sodium 
borohydride (NaBH4) was dissolved in  100 m l of DDIW to obtain  the borohydride 
soluti on ([BH₄]⁻) . The two solutions were magnetically mixed for 15 min  before the 
reduction process to ensure the complete  dissolution of solid substances . Afterwards , as 
demonstrated in Figure 2.1, a four -neck flask was installed inside a water bath to control 
the reduction temperature at 30 ℃. In addition, a mechanical mixer was mounted in the 
central neck of the flask to vigorously mix the solutions during the reduction process  at a 
speed of 400 rpm. Under the continuous purging of pure nitrogen gas  (N₂), the ferric 
solution was poured in to the flask ; then, the borohydride solution was drop wisely added  
to the ferric solution through a peris taltic pump (NRP -3000 , Tokyo Rika Kikai Co., Ltd. , 
Japan) at a flow rate of 20 m l min-1. The brownish orange color  of the ferric solution 
gradually disappeared and turned to black after introducing the borohydride solution 
because of the chemical reduction  of ferric ions (Fe3+) to zerovalent iron (Fe0) as 
illustrated in equation (2.1) [109,149] : 
𝟐𝑭𝒆 𝑪𝒍𝟑∙𝟔𝑯𝟐𝑶+𝟔𝑵𝒂𝑩𝑯 𝟒+𝟏𝟖𝑯𝟐𝑶→𝟐𝑭𝒆𝟎↓+𝟐𝟏𝑯𝟐↑+𝟔𝑩(𝑶𝑯)𝟑+𝟔𝑵𝒂𝑪𝒍  (2.1) 
After adding the borohydride solution, the black mixture was stirred for 5 min as an aging 
time to guarantee the complete  formation of zerovalent iron nanoparticles (Fe0). After 
that, a vacuum filtration system  (Ф47mm SPC glass filtration system, SIBATA Scientific 
Technology LTD. , Japan)  was used to collect the black precipitates under the nitrogen 
atmosphere  (N2) to prevent the passivation of Fe0 nanoparticles . It is important to mention 
that, during the filtratio n process, the acquired black powder was washed with 300 mL of 
DDIW to remove any chemical residues. The freshly obtained Fe0 nanoparticles were 
directly used in the batch experiments.

2.3. Synthesis  of Mg(OH) 2-encapsulate d Fe0 nanoparticles  (Mg/Fe0) 
Fe0 nanoparticles were encapsulated with a superfine layer of magnesi um hydroxide 
(Mg/Fe0) using  the modified thermal precipitation method  as manifested in Error! R
eference source not found.  [133,149] . Thoroughly , 0.5 g of Fe0 nanoparticles w ere 
encapsulated  with a magnesium hydroxide  shell  (Mg/Fe0) as follows: 0.5 g of newly 
synthesized  Fe0 nanoparticles  were mixed  with 300 mL of ethanol  under a continuous 
flow of pure nitrogen gas (N 2). Then , the admixture  of (Fe0/ethanol) was treated by 
ultrasonication (38 kHz, 100 W , ASU -10, AS ONE Corporation , Japan ) for 30 min to 
make sure that Fe0 nanoparticles were  fully  disperse d in ethanol  before the beginning of 
the precipitation step. Moreover, t he temperature of the ultrasonication  bath was 
controlled at 50 °C to successfully  coat Fe0 nanoparticles with Mg(OH) 2 layer . Thereafter , 
to guarantee the constant  molarity ratio between magnesium (Mg2+) and hydroxide ions 
(OH-) as displayed  in equation (2.2) and to attain  various  mass ratios between Mg(OH) 2 
and Fe0, specific  volumes of 2 g L-1 of (Mg2+/ethanol) solution and 6 g L-1 of 
(NaOH/ethanol) solution were  sequentially  added  to the mixtur e of (Fe0/ethanol) by a 
peristaltic pump  (SMP -23AS , AS ONE Corporation , Japan ) at a flow rate of 2 m l min-1.

precipitation technique.  
For example , to produce  0.5 g of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles with a 5% [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] mass 
ratio, 12.5 ml of (Mg2+/ethanol) solution and 13.75  ml of (NaOH/ethanol) solution were 
drop-wisely introduced  to the ( Fe0/ethanol) mixture . After adding (Mg2+/ethanol) and 
(NaOH/ethanol) solutions, one hour aging time was adjusted in the ultrasonicator . 
Moreover , it is essential  to point out  that pure nitrogen gas  (N2) was constantly purged  
throughout  the coating  stage  to protect Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles from oxidation . Finally , 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles were rinsed  with 200 mL of ethanol and acqui red by a vacuum 
filtration system  (Ф90mm SPC glass filtration system, SIBATA Scientific Technology 
LTD. , Japan) . 
2.4. Characterization  of nanomaterials  
The physicochemical characteristics  of the synthesized nanomaterials , e.g., Fe0 
nanoparticles, Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles, and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles,  were revealed using 
several techniques such as t ransmission electron microscopy (TEM) , scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) , energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy  (EDS) , x-ray diffraction 
(XRD) , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) , Brunauer –Emmett –Teller 
specific surface area analyzer  (SSA BET), and laser diffraction particle size analyzer . 
Furthermore, the point of zero charge of the nanomaterials was determined using the salt 
addition method. Details of each technique are provided in the following subsections.  
2.4.1.  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  is a technology used to visualize the 
morpholog ical properties of nanomaterials , such as shape, particle size, and distribution  
[150,151] . TEM specimens of Fe0 and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticle s before and after the reaction 
 
 29 
 Chapter  2 
 with CIP  were prepared as follows  [63,152 –154]: a small portion of each nanomaterial 
was dispersed in 10 mL of ethanol under ultrasonication ( 38 kHz, 100 W , ASU -10, AS 
ONE Corporation , Japan) for 10 min to  ensure that the nanomat erials were not 
agglomerated or aggregated. Afterwards, two to three droplets of the dispersed 
nanomaterials were deposited on to nitorocellulose film (30-40nm thickness) supported 
by a carbon layer (10 -15nm thickness)  (COL -C10, Okenshoji Co., Ltd. , Japan). The 
samples were kept in a  vacuum  dryer for 5 min to allow the vaporization of ethanol before 
TEM analysis. The morphology of nanomaterials w as then acquired by JEM -ARM 200F  
(JEOL Co., Japan ) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV .  
2.4.2.  Scanning electro n microscopy (SEM)  
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a tool utilized to get information about the 
surface topography of nanomaterials by scanning their surfaces with a concentrated beam 
of electron s [46,155] . TEM analysis provides higher -resolution morphological image s 
than SEM analysis  [150] . However, sample preparation and analysis procedures of TEM 
are more complicated and time -consuming than SEM analysis [156] . For SEM analysis, 
the specimens  of Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles , before and after the interaction with 
CIP, were prepared as follows [46,157] : two-sided carbon tape was placed on the SEM 
sample stub . Hereafter, the powder form of Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) was sprinkled  on the 
surface of the carbon tape . Then , SEM images of Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles were 
obtained by JSM-IT700HR  (JEOL Ltd., Japan ) at an opera ting voltage of 15 kV . 
2.4.3.  Energy dispersive x -ray spectroscopy (EDS)  
Energy dispersive x -ray spectroscopy (EDS)  is an analytical method employed  to identify 
and quantify the surface elemental composition of nanomaterials  [158,159] . Usually, EDS 
systems are attached to an electron microscopy device, for instance , TEM or SEM  
[160,161] . EDS analysis for the synthesized nanomaterials , before and after the removal 
of CIP, was performed  in conjunction with TEM ( JEM -ARM 200F , JEOL Co., Japan ) 
and SEM ( JSM-IT700HR , JEOL Ltd., Japan ) analysis.  
2.4.4.  X-ray diffraction (XRD)  
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is an accreditable method to define nanomaterials' 
chemical composition, crystal structure, and crystallite size  [147,162] . XRD analysis for 
the fabricated nanomaterials, before and after the elimination of CIP, was conducted by  
 30 
 Chapter  2 
 TTR Rigaku diffractometer  (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) , which  employs Cu k α radiation to 
generate X -rays with a wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The diffractometer was operating at 5 0 
kV and 300 mA  while the range of scanning angle (2θ) was set to be from 3° to 90° at a 
scanning rate of  2°/min. 
The crystallite size of freshly synthesized  nanomaterials was determined using Scherrer ’s 
equation  [46,149,153,163] : 
𝑫= 𝑲𝝀
𝜷 𝒄𝒐𝒔𝜽𝑩 (2.3) 
  
Where D, K, λ, β, and 𝜃𝐵 denote for crystallite size of nanomaterial (nm), shape constant 
(K = 0.89 or 0.9), wavelength  of applied x -ray (λ = 0.154 nm), peak width at half 
maximum height  (radians ), and reflection angle ( radians ), respectively.   
2.4.5.  Fourier Transform Infrared spectro scopy (FTIR)  
Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)  is an instrument used to define the 
functional groups of nanomaterials [153,164] . In addition, FTIR can also be  employed to 
determine the chemical compositions of nanomaterials [160,165] . Moreover, the reactive 
sites on the surface of nanomaterials can be recognized by FTIR [160] . Surface functional 
groups and chemical composition of freshly prepared nanomaterials , as well as the nature 
of the interaction between the nanomaterials and CIP , were obtained by FT/IR -4200 
(JASCO, Japan) within an infrared absorption frequency  of 500 to 4000 cm-1. 
2.4.6.  Brunauer –Emmett –Teller specific surface area (SSA BET) analysis  
Brunauer –Emmett –Teller specific surface area (SSA BET) analysis  is a method  used to 
measure the surface area per mass of nanomaterials (m2 g-1) through gas absorption such 
as nitrogen , argon, or krypton  [166] . N2 adsorption -desorpt ion isotherms  and specific 
surface area of Fe0 nanoparticles were  acquired by 3Flex surface characterization  
(Micromeritics, USA)  at 77.15K  [46]. Before SSA BET analysis, Fe0 nanoparticles were 
preheated at 423.15K and degassed at 623.15K for 2 h under a continuous flow of N 2 gas 
to en sure that the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles was clean from any impurities .  
 31 
 Chapter  2 
 2.4.7.  Particle size & size distribution  
Laser diffraction particle size analysis is a technique used to measure particle size and 
particle size distribution (PSD) of nanomaterials within a range of 20 nm to  2000 µm  
[46,167] . The particle size distribution of Fe0 nanoparticles was measured by a  SALD -
2300  laser diffraction analyzer  (SHIMADZU, Japa n). 
2.4.8.  Point of zero charge of nanomaterials  [pH (PZC)] 
The zero point of charge [pH (ZPC)] of Fe0 nanoparticles, Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles, and 
(Fe0/oxalate ) nanoparticles was defined  using the salt addition method  [46,133,168,169] . 
Five glass vials were filled with 50 mL of 0.1 M of potassium chloride ( KCl), and the pH 
of each vial was modified to a particular value (e.g., 2, 5, 7, 9, and 11) using sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). After the pH adjustment, 0.1 g of a 
nanomaterial was added to each vial and kept at room temperature for 24 h. At the end of 
the experiment, the final pH of the solution was record ed by a portable pH meter ( D-
210P -S, LAQUA, HORIBA) . Then, the plot of pH Final (Y-axis) verse pH Initial (X-axis) was 
constructed where the intersection point between this plot and bisector represents the zero 
point of charge [pH (ZPC)] of the nanomaterial o f interest.   
2.5. Experimental procedures  
2.5.1.  Reactivity  experiments  
The reactivity of the synthesized nanomaterials [e.g., Fe0, Mg/Fe0, and (Fe0/oxalate) ] and 
their competence in removing CIP from aqueous solutions w ere evaluated through 
various batch experiments. The batch experiments were conducted in a 200 m l 
Erlenmeyer flask  under multiple  conditions, for instance, nanomaterial dosage (g L-1), 
CIP initial concentrations (mg L-1), initial pH, reaction temperature ( ℃), and contact time 
(min ). Initially, the performance of the nanomaterials was examined under primary 
conditions , as illustrated in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3. Then, based on the outcomes of the 
preliminary experiments, an experimental plan was set up to systematically optimize the 
treatment conditions of CIP by the proposed nanomaterials  by varyin g the numerical 
value of each parameter  within a specific  range , as shown in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3. The 
optimization process aimed  to define the optimum treatment conditions that achieve the 
best removal efficiency of CIP by the suggested  nanomaterials with in a reasonable 
treatment cost .

 2.5.2.  Effect of water matrix on the competence of nanomaterials  
Domestic, hospital, industrial , and pharmaceutical wastewater are complex mediums and 
contain a variety of foreign ions and natural organic matters (NOM) with high 
concentrations [170,171] . These substances can negatively affect nanomaterials' 
effectivenes s in removing CIP from these types of waste water [172,173] . Hence, it was 
crucial to study the influence of ionic strength (IS) (i.e., NaCl), natural organic matters 
(e.g., humic acid), and coexisting ions (i.e., cations and anions) on th e efficacy  of 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles, as displayed in Table 2.4, to ensure their competence in field -
scale applications.

2.5.3.  Desorption experiments  
Identifying the responsible removal mechanisms of pollutants by nanomaterials is vital  to 
understand and predict the behavior of these materials under different treatment 
circumstances. As mentioned in section  1.4.2 , Fe0 nanoparticles and other iron -based  
 34 
 Chapter  2 
 nanoparticles can eliminate organic pollution through  adsorption and oxidation. 
Therefore, desorption experiments were performed  to determine the contribution of 
adsorption and oxidation in removing  CIP by Mg/Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles. 
Desorption experiments were designed in accordance with the features of each 
nanomaterial as follows:  
2.5.3.1.  Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  
After t reating CIP -polluted solutions, the exhausted Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles were  collected 
via a vacuum filt ration system (Ф90mm SPC glass filtration system, SIBATA Scientific 
Technology LTD. , Japan) . The acquired Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles were then immerse d in 0.2 
L of 1 M NaOH solution and stirred via a magnetic stirrer at 1000 rpm for three  hours at 
25 ℃ to desorb the adsorbed molecules of CIP [174,175] . 
2.5.3.2.  (Fe0/oxalate ) nano particles  
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles were employed to treat CIP -polluted water  at various initial 
pH (e.g., 5, 7, 9, and 11). Afterwards, the utilized (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles were 
acquired by a vacuum filtration system ( Ф90mm SPC glass filtration syst em, SIBATA 
Scientific Technology LTD. , Japan ). Hereafter , the exhausted  (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles 
were submerge d in 0.2 L of deionized water with  an initial  pH of 3 at 25 ℃  for one day 
[63]. This procedure  was repeated using deionized water with  an initial  pH of 5 and 12 to 
define the optimum pH for attaining  the maximum  desorption  percentage . 
For both iron-based nanomaterials  [e.g., Mg/Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate)] , the released 
concentration of CIP in the desorption solution represents the percentage of CIP 
adsorptio n. In contrast, the difference between the total removal efficiency and the 
percentage of adsorption represents the proportion of oxidation.  
2.5.4.  Regeneration  and recyclability of iron -based nanomaterials  
Regeneration and reusing the spent nanomaterials for sev eral treatment cycles are 
extremely important to decrease the cost of nanomaterial synthesis a nd the treatment 
process. Moreover, recycling the used nanomaterials significantly minimizes the 
generation of sludge after the completion of the treatment proces s. Hence, it is crucial  to 
evaluate the recyclability and reusability of Mg/Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles to 
ensure their adequacy in field -scale applications. A regeneration and recycling protocol  
 35 
 Chapter  2 
 for each iron -based nanomaterial was proposed based on the outcomes of the desorption 
experiments.  
2.5.4.1.  Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  
The recyclability  of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles for many  adsorption cycles  was examined as 
follows: 500 mg of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles w ere employed in five consecutive treatment  
cycles to remediate  five liters of 100 mg L-1 of CIP-polluted  water. At the end of each 
treatment  process, the used Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles were collected by a vacuum filtration  
system  and regenerated by submerging them in 0.2 L  of 1 mol L-1 NaOH solution fo r 1 
h. Then , a new Mg(OH) 2 shell was provided to the exhausted  Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles , as 
elaborated in section 2.3 , before star ting the next treatment  cycle.    
2.5.4.2.  (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles    
After the completion of the treatment stage , the used (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles were 
collected via a vacuum filtration system. Then , the utilized  (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles 
were immersed  in 0.2 L of deionized water with an initial pH of 5. Afterwards , the mixture 
was magnetically stirred  for 1 h. Subsequently , the regenerated (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles were collected by a vacuum filtration system and used again to treat CIP -
polluted  water .   
2.5.5.  Longevity and storage experiments  for Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  
Continuous exposure of Fe0 nanoparticles to air will promptly oxidize them and diminish 
their decontamination reactivity towards water pollutants due to forming  a passivation 
layer of iron oxides and hydroxides [ Equation (1.6)]. Although t he formation of a 
passivation layer of iron oxides and hydroxides on the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles is 
beneficial  for the adsorption of certain types of pollutants such as phosphorus , the 
presence of such a layer prevent s the interaction between the reactive sites on the surface 
of Fe0 nanoparticles and the organic pollutants , such as CIP, and reduce s their removal 
from polluted waters . Coating Fe0 nanoparticles with a shell of magnesium hydroxide 
should protect the core of Fe0 nanoparticles from oxidation by minimizing the formulation 
of the passivation layer over time which allows the easy handling of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles 
during the transportation  from the synthesis facilities to the contaminated locations in 
addition to the simple storage requirement in the site.   
 36 
 Chapter  2 
 Longevity experiments  were conducted  to confirm  the possibility  of storing and 
conveying  Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  from manufacturing facili ties to the contaminated sites 
without significant deterioration in their efficacy.  Three  empty plastic  containers (10 m l) 
were prepared by adding 100 mg of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles to each container , sealed , and 
stored at room temperature . After storage for d ifferent periods, for instance, 5, 10, and 30 
days, CIP -polluted solutions were treated, in batch experiments, by using the stored 
materials. Furthermore, to elucidate the effect of storage solution , three  samples of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  (100 mg) were stored in 5 m l of different solutions, for example, 
deionized water, ethanol , and a mix of ethanol and deionized water with a volume ratio 
of 1:1 . After one month of storage , batch experiments were executed using the stored 
materials to select  the be st storage  solution  for Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles .  
2.5.6.  Sampling procedures and evaluation criteria  
The treatment process of CIP -polluted solutions start ed after adding a specific  dosage of 
the iron -based nanomaterial s to the CIP solution and placing the Erlenmey er flask on a 
magnetic stirrer  (REXIM , AS ONE Corporation , Japan) at 500 rpm . At specific time 
intervals  [e.g., 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min for Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles and 
5, 10, 20, and 30 min  for (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles] , 2 m l liquid sample  was taken  from 
the flask by a 10 ml  syringe  (Terumo Corporation , Japan) , immediately  filtered by using 
a syringe filter  (0.45 µm, Advantec Co.,  Ltd. Corporation , Japan) , and stored in microtube  
(2 m l, BIO-BIK, Ina-optika corporation , Japan)  for further analysis.  The competence of 
Fe0, Mg/Fe0, and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  in eliminating CIP from polluted water was 
assessed by the calculation of r emoval efficiency (%) and removal capacity (mg g-1) using 
the following equations:  
𝑹𝒆𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒂𝒍  𝑬𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒚  (%)= (𝑪𝒊−𝑪𝒕)
𝑪𝒊×𝟏𝟎𝟎 % (2.4) 
𝑹𝒆𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒂𝒍  𝑪𝒂𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒊𝒕𝒚  (𝒎𝒈/𝒈)= (𝑪𝒊−𝑪𝒕)×𝑽

Where Ci, Ct, V, and m symbolize CIP initial concentration  (mg L-1), CIP concentration 
(mg L-1) at a particular time t (min), volume of CIP solution (L), and weight of the iron-
based nanomaterial  (g), respectively.

 2.6. Prototype lab-scale treatment system  (PLSTS)  
A prototype lab-scale treatment system  (PLSTS)  was proposed as a suitable tool to  
remediate streams of CIP-polluted  waters in real  contaminated sites . The system was 
fabricated following  the design consideration of our previous study  [147] . Figure 2.3 
demonstrates a schematic diagram for the proposed PLSTS. The treatment system 
consist ed of five units : feeding tank, reactor, separation  unit, aeration tank, and sand 
filtration column . The s pecifications and function of each unit are summarized  in the 
following subsections.  
2.6.1.  Feeding tank  
The feeding tank is  a plastic container  filled with 10 L of 100 mg L-1 of CIP-polluted  
solution.  A peristaltic pump (EYELA RP -1100, Tokyo Rika Kikai Co., Ltd. , Japan) was 
used to feed the system with the polluted  water at different flow rates  (Table 2.5). 
2.6.2.  Reactor  
It is a 2 L four-neck flask, and it is the place where Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles can interact with 
the polluted  water and adsorb the molecules of CIP. A mechanical stirrer occupied the 
central neck of the four -neck flask  to mix the solution at 250 rpm.  On the other hand, the 
other three inlets were occupied by the feeding tube, the recycling tube , and  the 
connecting tube between the reactor and separation unit. Also, the reactor was placed in 
a water bath to control the temperature at 25 °C  (Figure 2.3). 
 
Figure 2.3 Schematic diagram for the prototype lab-scale treatment system.

 Chapter  2 
 2.6.3.  Separation  unit 
It is a  plexiglass  unit with a specific structure designed to  produce clean effluents by 
facilitating  the settlement and the separation of Mg/F e0 nanoparticles from the solution.  
The separation  unit consists of a straight cylindrical part with a height of 20 cm and an 
interior diameter of 11 cm with an effective volume of 1.9  L. Moreover, the straight 
cylindrical p ortion  is divided by a plexiglass plate along its height to force the water to 
move in a U shape , as shown in Figure 2.3, which enhances the settlement proc ess of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles . In addition, the bottom of the cylinder is attached to a plastic cone 
with a height of 7 cm to collect and recycle the settled Mg/Fe0 nano particles  in the reactor. 
The total effective volume of the separation  unit is approximat ely 2 L  (Figure 2.3). 
2.6.4.  Aeration tank  
It is a plastic box with a 20.5 cm length, 14 cm width , 10 cm height , and an approximate  
volume of 2.87 L. Th is unit aimed  to precipitate any Mg/Fe0 nano particles discharged  
from the separation  unit. Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 2.3, the aeration tan k was 
designed with a unique structure to increase the water flow pathway, expose it to air and 
oxidize any residue  of Mg/Fe0 nano particles . 
2.6.5.  Sand filtration column  
It is a plexiglass cylindrical column with a height of 20 cm and an internal diameter of 11 
cm. The filtration column was filled with 1467g of standard sand (JIS standard sand No.5, 
S-208, AS ONE  cooperation, Japan)  to remove any Mg/Fe0 nano particles left f rom the 
separation  unit and the aeration tank  (Figure 2.3). Moreover, it was used to remove the 
color of the oxidized water in the aeration tank and produce clean effluent s. The treated 
water from the aeration tank was pumped in to the sand column by an up -flow mood to 
ensure that the water flow ed within the whole section of the sa nd column.  The pumping 
rate was adjusted  to be 2 5 ml min-1. 
2.6.6.  Recycling system  
A recycling tube was established between the separation  unit and the reactor to return the 
collected Mg/Fe0 nano particles to the reactor ( Figure 2.3). This process may enhance the 
efficiency of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  by increasing the interaction time between Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles  and CIP-polluted  water. The recycling rate was controlled by a peristaltic  
 39 
 Chapter  2 
 pump ( EYELA RP -1100, Tokyo Rika Kikai Co., Ltd., Japan) at a flow rate of 2 5 ml min-
1.  
2.6.7.  Experimental design for PLSTS  
The conditions of treating CIP -polluted  solutions by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles, for  example, 
Mg/Fe0 dosage (g L-1), initial pH, temperature ( ℃), and initial CIP concentration (mg L-
1), were optimized in the batch experiments. Thus , three treatment cycles were operated 
under the previously optimized treatment conditions , as presented in Table 2.5, to treat 
10 liters  of 100 mg L−1 CIP-polluted  water . It can be seen from Table 2.5 that the only 
difference between each treatment cycle was the feeding flow rate , as it was changed from 
25 to 75 ml min-1 to determine the optimum flow rate of the polluted  water.

2.7. Analytical instruments  
CIP concentration in aqueous solutions was measured by UV-vis spectrophotomet ry at a 
wavelength of 275 nm ( UV-1280, SHIMADZU, Japan ).  UV -1280 spectrophotometer 
was calibrated to determine CIP concentration in water.  The calibration process was  as 
follows: eight CIP standard solutions with concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 
5 mg L-1 were prepared.  Then, 8 UV quartz cell s were filled with 5 m l of each standard 
solution. After that , the cells were consecutively inserted in the UV-1280 to acquire the 
absorbance value at 275 nm.  A calibration curve was developed  by plotting the 
absorbance value (X -axis) against CIP concentration (Y-axis) as manifested in Figure 2.4. 
The equation of the calibration curve was as follows:  
𝐘 = 𝟖.𝟗𝟏𝟏𝐗  (2.6) 
Where Y and X represent  CIP concentration (mg L-1) and the absorbance that was 
acquired  from the UV-1280  spectrophotometer at 275 nm .

 Chapter  2 
  
Figure 2.4. Calibration curve of UV -1280 spectrophotometer.  
Figure 2.4 shows that t he determination coefficient (R2) of the obtained calibration curve 
was exactly 1 , confirming the successful calibration of the  UV-1280 spectrophotometer . 
It is important to menti on that the collected samples were diluted using deionized water 
with the proper dilution factor to fit the calibration curve rang e (0 – 5 mg L-1). 
The concentrations of total dissolved iron [Fe] and ferrous ions [Fe2+] were determined 
by UV–Vis spectrophotometer (DR3900, HACH Co., USA)  following  the USEPA 
FerroVer iron  and 1,10-phenanthroline  protocols, respectively. Then, the concentration 
of ferric ions [Fe3+] was mathematically calculated using the following equatio n: 
[Fe3+] (mg L-1) = [Fe] (mg L-1) – [Fe2+] (mg L-1) (2.7) 
In addition, the concentration of magnesium ions (Mg2⁺) was measured  by DR3900 
spectrophotometer (HACH, USA) following the Metal Phthalein Colorimetric Method 
(0.5 to 10 mg L−1). Furthermore, pH, redox potential (E h), and solution temperature were  
recorded  using LAQUA pH meter (HORIBA Advanced Techno, Co., Ltd., Japan).  
2.8. Modeling of ciprofloxacin adsorption  
Kinetics, isotherm, and thermodynamic analysis for the adsorption of CIP by Mg/Fe0 and 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  were performed using various models to get more insights into 
 
 41 
 Chapter  2 
 the nature of the reaction between CIP and the iron -based nanomaterials  in aqueous 
solutions  [63,176] . In addition, they provide numerical outcomes that help in defin ing the 
type (e.g., physisorption and chemosorption) and mechanism of CIP adsorption from 
polluted waters  [46].

2.8.2.  Kinetic modeling  
Kinetics analysis describes the rate of CIP adsorption under certain conditions and 
predict s how fast the adsorption process will be  under these  circumstances [177] . The 
kinetics of CIP adsorption by iron-based nanomaterials was analyzed by four kinetic 
models : Pseudo first -order, Pseudo second -order, Elovich , and intraparticle diffusion. 
The concept of each model as well as their theoretical assumptions are described in the 
following sections.  
2.8.2.1.  Pseudo -first-order model:  
Lagergren proposed pseudo -first-order model (PFO)  to depict  the adsorption kinetics of 
ocalic and malonic acids onto charcoal  [178,179] . The following equation represents the 
differential equation of PFO : 
𝒅𝒒𝒕
𝒅𝒕=𝒌𝟏(𝒒𝒆− 𝒒𝒕 ) (2.8) 
Equation (2.8) can be integrated (Boundary conditions are as follows: t = 0 to t = t and q 
= 0 to q > 0) to give the following form of the PFO model : 
𝐥𝐧(𝒒𝒆− 𝒒𝒕)=𝐥𝐧(𝒒𝒆)−𝒌𝟏𝒕 (2.9)  
 43 
 Chapter  2 
 2.8.2.2.  Pseudo -second -order model:  
Blanchard et al. suggested the Pseudo  second -order  model (PSO) to describe the kinetics 
of removing heavy metals by natural zeolites [180] . The differential equation of PSO can 
be written, based on the reported form  by Ho  in 1995 , as follows [181] :  
𝒅𝒒𝒕
𝒅𝒕=𝒌𝟐(𝒒𝒆− 𝒒𝒕) 𝟐 (2.10) 
 After the integration of equation (2.10) (Boundary conditions  are as follows:  t = 0 to t = 
t and q = 0 to q > 0 ), the formula of PSO model can be rearranged as follows:  
𝒕
𝒒𝒕=𝟏
𝒌𝟐𝒒𝒆𝟐+𝒕
𝒒𝒆 (2.11) 
2.8.2.3.  Elovich model 
Roginsky and Zeldovich developed the Elovich model  in 1934 to characterize the 
chemisorption of carbon  monoxide  on manganese dioxide [182] . The basic equation of 
the Elovich model is expressed as follows:  
𝒅𝒒𝒕
𝒅𝒕= 𝜶 𝐞𝐱𝐩  (−𝜷𝒒) (2.12) 
After integrating equation  (2.12), the Elovich equation can be written as follows:  
𝒒𝒕= 𝟏
𝜷𝐥𝐧 (𝟏+𝜶𝜷𝒕 ) (2.13) 
2.8.2.4.  Intraparticle diffusion model 
In 1962, Weber and Morris proposed the intraparticle diffusion model [183] . The equation 
of the intraparticle diffusion model is expressed in equation  (2.14):  
𝒒𝒕= 𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒂 ×𝒕𝟎.𝟓+𝑪 (2.14) 
2.8.3.  Isotherm Modeling  
Isotherm modeling characterize s the interaction of pollutants with adsorbents  in aqueous 
mediums  [184] . Moreover, it speculates adsorbents' surface properties and estimates  their 
maximum adsorption capacities toward water pollutants.  Five isotherm models were used 
to represent the equilibrium data of CIP adsorption by Mg/Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate)  
 44 
 Chapter  2 
 nanoparticles. These models are Langmuir , Freundlich , Temkin , Dubinin –Radushkevich , 
and Sips isotherm models.  
2.8.3.1.  Langmuir isotherm model 
Langmuir isotherm model represents the monolayer adsorption of a pollutant  on the 
surface of an adsorbent [185] . It assumes that the surface of an adsorbent has a limited 
number of identical adsorption sites, where each site can only adsorb a single molecule 
of a pollutant with no possible interaction b etween the neighboring sites. The equation of 
Langmuir can be written as follows:  
𝐪𝐞= 𝐐𝟎 𝐊𝐋 𝐂𝐞
𝟏+𝐊𝐋 𝐂𝐞  (2.15) 
  
RL is a dimensionless parameter called separation factor which was developed by Weber  
and Chakravorti  to describe the adsorption nature of a pollutant  by an adsorbent [186] . 
The separation factor (R L) can be defined as follows:  
𝐑𝐋= 𝟏
𝟏+𝐊𝐋𝐂𝟎  (2.16) 
The adsorption nature can be interpreted from the value of R L as follows:  
• The adsorption is unfavorable if R L>1. 
• The adsorption is favorable if 1 > R L> 0. 
• The adsorption is irreversible if R L = 0. 
• The adsorption is linear if R L=1. 
It is important to mention that if the equilibrium data of an experiment is well fitted with 
the Langmuir isotherm model, this suggests that the adsorption type is chemisorptio n 
[185] .  
2.8.3.2.  Freundlich isotherm model 
Freundlich isotherm model was designed for the sorption  of animal charcoal . It repres ents 
the multilayer adsorption of a pollutant on a heterogenous surface of an adsorbent. 
Freundlich 's model supposes that heat and a dsorption affinity  are not uniformly  
 45 
 Chapter  2 
 distributed over the surface of an adsorbent [185] . The equation of Freundlich is shown 
in the following equation:  
𝒒𝒆= 𝑲𝒇 𝑪𝒆𝟏
𝒏 (2.17) 
Similar to R L in the Langmuir isotherm model, the inverse value of n can be used to 
demonstrate the nature of the adsorption as follows:  
• If the value of (1/n) lies between 0 and 1, the adsorption is favorable.  
• If the value of (1/n) is greater than 1, the adsorption is unfavorable . 
• If the value of (1/n) equals  1, the adsorption is irreversible.   
2.8.3.3.  Temkin isotherm model 
The original application of the Temkin isotherm model was to illustrate the chemisorption 
of hyd rogen on platinum electrodes in an acid medium [185] .  This model presume s that 
the heat of the adsorption for all molecules on the surface of the adsorbent is linearly 
decreasing as the adsorption is complet ed.  The non -linear form of Temkin is displayed 
in the following equation:  
𝒒𝒆= 𝑹×𝑻
𝒃𝑻 𝐥𝐧 (𝑨𝑻𝑪𝒆) (2.18) 
2.8.3.4.  Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm model  
Dubinin –Radushkevich  was developed to describe the adsorption of vapors and gases on 
microporous materials such as activated carbon [185,187] . The non -linear formula of 
Dubinin –Radushkevich  is illustrated in equation  (2.19): 
𝒒𝒆= 𝒒𝒔×𝒆−(𝑲𝒂𝒅×𝜺𝟐) (2.19) 
 The parameter (ε) can be calculated from the following equation:  
𝜺= 𝑹 ×𝑻×[𝟏+𝟏
𝑪𝒆] (2.20) 
Dubinin –Radushkevich  model is  also designed to differentiate between the chemical and 
physical adsorption of metals by calculating the required adsorption  energy (E) to remove 
one molecule f rom the solution to the sorption site of an adsorbent  [188] . For i nstance, i f  
 46 
 Chapter  2 
 the value of  E is less than 8 kJ mol−1, the adsorption is physisorption  [189] . However, if 
the value of E lies betwee n 8 and 16  kJ mol−1, the adsorption is chemosorption  [189] . The 
mean adsorption energy (E) (J mol-1) can be calculated using the following formula:   
𝑬=[𝟏
√𝟐𝑲𝒂𝒅] (2.21) 
2.8.3.5.  Sips isotherm model 
Sips isotherm model is a  three -parameter isotherm model [190] . It was developed as a 
combination of the Langmuir  and Freundlich  isotherm model to improve the prediction 
of adsorption on heterogeneous  surfaces [191] . The equation of the Sips model is as 
follows [192,193] :  
𝒒𝒆=𝒒𝒔×(𝑲𝒔𝑪𝒆)𝒏𝒔
𝟏+(𝑲𝒔𝑪𝒆)𝒏𝒔 (2.22) 
Sips isotherm equation can be reduced to the Freundlich  isotherm formula when CIP 
concentration is very low. On the other hand, at high CIP concentrations, the Sips model 
is closer to represent the Langmuir isotherm equation.  
2.8.4.  Nonlinear regression analysis and Akaike’s Information Criterion  
Non-linear regression was employed  to carefully fit the experimental outcomes  with the 
kinetic s and isotherm models  and avoid any mistakes resulting  from the linearization 
process . The non -linear regression was implemented  using Microsoft Excel .  
Akaike's Information Criterion  (AIC) is a statistical method  developed to  choose the best 
model that describes the experimental data [194] . The model with the lowest AIC 
indicates that  this model is the best to describe  the experimental data.   
The va lue of AIC value  for each model  can be determined  using the following equation:  
𝑨𝑰𝑪  =𝑵𝐥𝐧(𝑺𝑺𝑬
𝑵)+𝟐𝑵𝒑+𝟐𝑵𝒑(𝑵𝒑+𝟏)
𝑵−𝑵𝒑−𝟏 (2.23) 
Where SSE, N, and N p stand for  the sum of square error, number of experimental data , 
and number of parameters in the model, respectively.  
  
 47 
 Chapter  2 
 The Sum of square error (SEE) can be calculated  using the following formula:  
𝑺𝑺𝑬 = ∑(𝒒𝒕,𝒆𝒙𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 −𝒒𝒕,𝒎𝒐𝒅𝒆𝒍 )𝟐𝒕
𝒕=𝟎 (2.24) 
Where q t,experiment and q t, model  stand for the experimental removal capacity (mg g-1) and 
modeled removal capacity (mg g-1), respectively, at a particular time t (min).  
2.8.5.  Thermodynamic modeling  
Thermodynamic modeling  was carried out  to elucidate the influence  of temperature on 
the treatment of CIP -polluted waters by Mg/Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . 
Moreover, the analysis of thermodynamics is used to elaborate  on the type of CIP 
adsorption  by the proposed iron -based nanomaterials [195] . There are three import ant 
parameters for thermodynamic modeling , namely, Gibbs free energy change ( 𝛥𝐺0), 
entropy change ( 𝛥𝑆0), and enthalpy change  (𝛥𝐻0) [196] . 𝛥𝐺0 can be determined using 
Van't Hoff  equation : 
𝜟𝑮𝟎=−𝑹𝑻𝒍𝒏(𝑲𝒅) (2.25) 
 
The distribution coefficient ( 𝐾𝑑) was calculated using the following formula [175] :  
𝑲𝒅=𝒒𝒆
𝑪𝒆 (2.26) 
The 3rd principle of thermodynamics describes the relationship between 𝛥𝐺0 and the 
other parameters of thermodynamics as follows:  
𝜟𝑮𝟎=𝜟𝑯𝟎−𝑻𝜟𝑺𝟎 (2.27) 
After merging equation (2.25) and equation (2.27), the equation of Van't Hoff  equation  
will be as follows:  
𝒍𝒏(𝑲𝒅)=−𝜟𝑯𝟎
𝑹𝟏
𝑻+𝜟𝑺𝟎
𝑹 (2.28)

 Chapter  2 
 Based on equation (2.28), a plot of ln(K d) versus 1/T was constructed where  the slope and 
intercept of the plot were  used to calculate 𝛥𝐻0 and 𝛥𝑆0, respectively.  Then, equation 
(2.27) was used to calculate the value of 𝛥𝐺0. 
Sign and magnitude of thermodynamics parameters provide valuable  insights into the 
nature and type o f CIP adsorption by the proposed iron -based nanomaterials . Table 2.7 
and Table 2.8 clarify the meaning of both the sign and magnitude of thermodynamics 
parameters.

The activation energy of CIP adsorption by iron-based nanomaterials  was calculated from 
the slope of the plot of ln(k 2) versus the reciprocal of temperature (T-1). The magnitude

 Chapter  3 3.1. Characterization of nanomaterials  
3.1.1.  Transmission electron microscopy -energy -dispersive x-ray spectroscopy  
(TEM -EDS ) 
Figure 3.1 summarizes the results  of TEM analysis for freshly synthesized  Fe0, Mg/Fe0 
([Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] weight  ratio = 0.05) , and Mg(OH) 2 nano -powder  at various  resolutions  
(e.g. 20 and 100 nm). Figure 3.1.a & Figure 3.1.b illustrate  that Fe0 nanoparticles had a 
spherical shape with a n approximate  particle size of 70 nm. Moreover , Fe0 nanoparticles 
preferred  the formulation of a chain -like structure due to magnetic and electrostatic 
attractions between the neighboring Fe0 nano particles  [94]. In addition , Figure 3.1.c 
demonstrate s that the low coating percentage  of [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] (i.e. , 0.05) couldn’t 
inhibit  the aggregation of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. Furthermore , Figure 3.1.d proves the 
emergence  of the Mg(OH) 2 shell around Fe0 nano particles a nd the formation of Mg(OH) 2 
clouds that surround Mg/Fe0 nano particles , which may reinforce  them  with additional 
adsorption locations  for CIP. These clouds were  more pronounced in the TEM pictures  
of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles with higher [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] coating percentages , as illustrated  in 
Figure 3.2. Interestingly, the production  of Mg(OH) 2 nano -powder via a simple 
precipitation technique  resulted in the development of two shapes of Mg(OH) 2: cubic and 
needles , as manifested  in Figure 3.1.e & Figure 3.1.f . Figure 3.3 displays  the EDS 
spectrum and elemental mapping of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles . It illustrates  that the Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles were mainly composed  of iron  (Fe), oxygen  (O), and magnesium  (Mg) , 
with mass ratios  of 78.13%, 21.76% , and 0.11%, respectively. The difficult detection of 
magnesium on the surface of Mg/Fe0 nanop articles by EDS was because of the low 
deposition ratio  of Mg(OH) 2 (e.g., 5%).  
3.1.2.  X-ray diffraction analysis  (XRD)  
Crystalline structure  and composition  of iron-based nanoparticles  were acquir ed by 
carrying out  x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, TTR , Rigaku  Ltd., Japan). Figure 3.4 
summarizes  the XRD patterns for Fe0 and Mg/Fe0 ([Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] weight  ratio = 0.05) 
nanoparticles before and after the elimination  of CIP from aqueous solutions. Figure 3.4 
illustrates  that t he strong distinctive peak s of Fe0 appeared in XRD pattern of Fe0 at 2θ = 
44.86 ° and 2 θ = 82.2 ° [133] . On the contrary , the XRD pattern of fresh Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles (Figure 3.4) showed no major  changes compared with  the XRD pattern of  
 52 
 Chapter  3 Fe0 nanoparticles except for the weak detection of brucite [Mg(OH) 2] at two different 
locations (2 θ = 19.75 ° and 38.87 °). The trivial  detection of brucite in the XRD pattern of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles can be elucidat ed by the low deposition ratio of Mg(OH) 2 (i.e., 5%) 
throughout  the coating  process.

3.2. Effect of [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] weight  ratio  
The influence  of the coating percentage of Fe0 nanoparticles by a thin layer of Mg(OH) 2 
on the competence  of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles toward remediating CIP-polluted  waters was 
examined  by chancing  the [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] weight  ratio from 0.05 (i.e. , 5%) to 0.2 (i.e. , 
20%) during the coating  process. Figure 3.5.a reveals the effect of [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] weight  
ratio on the removal of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. In the early stage of reaction, 0.5 g 
L-1 of Fe0 nanoparticles showed 88.20% removal percenta ge of CIP within the first 10 
min of reaction. However, this trend did not continue later because Fe0 nanoparticles 
gradually lost their  adsorptive capacity by desorbing CIP molecules back to the solution 
to achieve 41.76% removal efficiency at the end of the reaction (i.e. , 180 min) ( Figure 
3.5.a). This percentage was confirmed to be permanent even after 24 hr. of reaction (data 
are not shown). It is worth noting that, in this study, the behavior of Fe0 nanoparticles in 
removing CIP from water is quite different from the previous reports [106,119,125] . For 
example , Chen et al.  demonstrated  that Fe0 nanopart icles didn’t show  a desorption trend ; 
on the other hand, Fe0 nanoparticles  could progressively remove CIP to reach a constant 
removal efficiency of 35% after 120 min of reaction [106] .

Figure 3.5 Effect of (a) [Mg(HO) 2/Fe0] weight  percentage  and (b) dosage of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles, (c) initial pH of 
polluted water , and (d) initial CIP concentration.  
This contradiction could be explained by the difference in the synthesis procedures of Fe0 
nanoparticles in this study and the previous studies. On the contrary, Figure 3.5.a 
illustrates that encapsulating Fe0 nanoparticles  by Mg(OH) 2 layer with a [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] 
weight  ratio of 0.05 was enough to sharply enhance  the removal of CIP, compar ed to Fe0 
nanoparticles , from 41.76% to 96.31%. T wo hypotheses could explain this outstanding 
performance . The first hypothesis suggests that coating the surface of the highly reactive 
Fe0 nanoparticles prevents the four electron -transfer reaction s [Equations (3.1) and (3.2)] 
that hinder the Fenton rea ction [Equation (3.3)] inside the Fe0 environment by consuming 
the produced hydrogen peroxide [Equation (3.2)], which in turn deteriorates the oxidation 
of CIP by Fenton reaction [Equation (3.3)] [136] . However, the second hypothesis 
assumes that the presence o f Mg(OH) 2 shell on the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles  
strengthens the adsorption proportion by providing additional  adsorption locations  [199] . 
Both hypotheses will be tested in section 3.6 , where the removal mechanism of CIP by 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles will be clarified .

In the scope of determining the optimum [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] weight  ratio that corresponds to 
the highest removal efficiency  of CIP, the [Mg(OH) 2/ Fe0] weight  ratio further increased 
to 0.1 and 0.2. As shown in Figure 3.5.a, increasing the coating ratio of Fe0 nanoparticles  
by Mg(OH) 2 from 0.05 to 0.1 and 0.2 slightly decreased the removal of CIP from 96.31% 
to 95.85% and 91.20%, respectively. The excessive precipitation of Mg(OH) 2 on the 
surface of Fe0 nanoparticles  may hide some reactive sites and prevent the dissolution of 
iron spec ies as well as the electron transfer from the core of Fe0 nanoparticles  which may 
impact  both the adsorption and oxidation of CIP by [0.1 -Mg/Fe0] and [0.2 -Mg/Fe0] 
nanoparticles [200] . According to Figure 3.5.a, the optimum weight  ratio of 
[Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] was 0.05. This ratio was used in the following experiments , and the 
nanomaterial with this ratio was named Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. According to our recent 
review, t his study reported the remarkable removal of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles for 
the first time in the literature  [69]. 
3.3. Effect of Mg/Fe0 dosage and initial pH  
The effect  of Mg/Fe0 dosage and initial pH on the uptake of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles 
from the water was investigated  by alerting the value of each parameter as shown  in Table 
2.2, Figure 3.5.b, and Figure 3.5.c.  
The weight  of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles that should be added to a particular  volume of CIP -
polluted  water must be controlled and optimized to minimize  the treatment cost and 
facilitate the management of nanoparticles after the completion of the treatment process. 
Figure 3.5.b discloses the effect of increasing the dosage of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles from 
0.2 to 1.5 g L-1 on removing 100 mg L-1 of CIP solution. Figure 3.5.b illustrated that 0.2 
g L-1 of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles removed  83.12% of CIP after 180 min of reaction. 
However, increasing the dosage to 0.3, 0.4 , and 0.5 g L-1 remarkably improved  the 
removal efficiency to achieve 91.23%, 95.35%, and 96.54%, respectively. In contrast, 
increasing the dosage of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles from 0.5 to 0.7 , 1, and 1.5 g L-1 slightly 
decreased the uptake percentage of CIP from 96.54% to 96.10%, 95.15% , and 94.56%,  
 57 
 Chapter  3 respectively. This behavior might be attributed to the fact that increasing the dosage of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles will increase the aggregation betwe en the particles , which may 
occupy or cover some of the reactive locations  [201]. In conclusion, the optimum dosage 
of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles was selected to be 0.5 g L-1, and this value was generalized in 
the subsequen t experiments.   
It is reported that the charge of the CIP molecule changes under different pH values [199] . 
For example, CIP becomes cationic molecule under pH < 6.1, zwitterionic molecule under 
6.1 < pH < 8.1 and anionic molecule under pH  > 8.6 [116] . Moreover, the influence of 
the pH is extended to a lert the surface charge of the Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles a nd promote or 
halt the release of iron ions which will affect the possible removal mechanisms such as 
adsorption and oxidation [202] . Thus, understanding  the influence  of initial pH on the 
removal of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles is important. Figure 3.5.c highlights the 
influence of initial pH on the efficacy  of Fe0 and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in removing  CIP 
from aqueous solutions . Figure 3.5.c emphasizes that removing  CIP by Fe0 nanoparticles  
was promoted under pH = 3 , where the removal efficiency hit its maximum value of 
66.56%. Comparable competence  was also recorded at pH = 5. Conversely, the removal 
efficiency of CIP  by Fe0 nanoparticles  pointedly  deteriorated  to 31.7% when the initial 
pH of the solution increased f rom 5 to 11. The acidic pH favors the corrosion and release 
of iron ions ( e.g., Fe2+ and Fe3+) form the core of Fe0 nanoparticles  which stimulate the 
oxidation of CIP by improving the generation of radicals inside the system [115] . These 
findings are consistent with the findings  of Liu at el.  as they remediated the antibiotic  
chloramphenicol  from aquatic  solutions at pH = 3 [203] . In contrast, the alkaline pH is 
not appropriate for the removal of CIP by Fe0 nanoparticles as it enc ourages the formation 
of a passivation layer on the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles which hides the reactive sites as 
well as hinder s the dissolution of iron ions from the core of Fe0 nanoparticles [120] .  
Surprisingly, encapsulating Fe0 nanoparticles with a thin layer of Mg(OH) 2 neutralized 
the effect of pH o n removing CIP from water by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles , as shown  in Figure 
3.5.c. In other words, more than 95% of 100 mg L-1 of CIP was removed by 0.5 g L-1 of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles when the initial pH changed from 5 to 11. However, the removal 
efficiency slightly decli ned to 90% under the strong ly acidic pH (e.g., pH = 3). This drop 
might be due to the evolution of hydrogen gas inside the system , which prevents  the 
adsorption of CIP on the surface of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles [203,204] . Since the pH of real  
 58 
 Chapter  3 wastewater ranges from 6.5 to 8.5, it can be predict ed that Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles can be 
used to treat actual  CIP-polluted  water s with removal efficiencies exceed ing 90% [205] . 
pH = 5 was selected as the optimum value  and applied in the following experiments.  Most 
of the proposed Fe0-based nano materials in the literature prefer the acidic pH to remove 
CIP [119–121]. This  behavior  limits  their application in real polluted  sites. Moreover, 
Chen et al. , in both articles , tried to expand the pH working range of polyvinylpyrrolidone 
stabilized Fe0/Cu bimetallic particles  and green synthesiz ed bimetallic Fe0/Cu from (4 -6) 
to (4-8) by applying a weak magnetic field during the treatment process [106,125] . Hence, 
this paper is the first to propose a nanomaterial with a wide working range of pH for 
eliminating  CIP from polluted water.   
The final pH of water at the end of the treatment process was also monitored to ensure 
the adequacy of discharging the treated water to nearby surface water bodies. Figure 3.6 
illustrates that the final pH of the treated water notably increased from 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 
(Initial pH) to 8.6, 9.7, 10.23, 9.62, and 9.9 (Final pH). Partial dissolution of Mg(OH) 2 
shell and corrosion of the core of Fe0 nanopar ticles  will release hydroxide ions ( OH−) 
which in turn will increase  the final pH of the treated water [206] . Based on Figure 3.6, 
the treated water by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles might need  slight titration to neutral pH before 
discharging it to surface water bodies.  
 
Figure 3.6 Monitoring the  pH of the treated water at the end of the reaction . Treatment  conditions were  as follows: 
[Mg/Fe0] = 0.5 g L-1, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, temperature = 25 °C, and contact time = 180 min.  
 
 59 
 Chapter  3 3.4. Effect of initial ciprofloxacin  concentration  
The effect  of CIP initial concentration on the competence of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles was 
explored by increasing CIP initial concentration from 50 to 200 mg L-1. Figure 3.5.d 
represents the efficiency of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in treating  CIP-polluted  water with 
various  initial concentrations ( e.g., 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg L-1).  The effect  of CIP 
initial concentration was notably minimized due to the extraordinary  performance  of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles to remove more than 93% of CIP over the studied range of 
concentrations , as demonstrated  in Figure 3.5.d. Most of the previous research articles 
stated that the increasing the initial concentration of an antibiotic significantly  deteriorate 
the uptake efficiency of the proposed  nanomaterial [106,120,125,207,208] . For example , 
Demirezen  et al.  indicated  that the removal  rate of the antibiotic a moxicillin  by iron oxide 
nanoparticles dimensioned from approximately 100% to less than 30% when the initial 
concentration of a moxicillin  increased from 5 to 15 mg L-1 [209] . For the first time, this 
study offers a novel nanomaterial with outstanding performance in removing CIP 
regardless of CIP initial concentration in water.  
3.5. Removal mechanism of ciprofloxacin by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  
Many  sets of batch experiments were carried out  with various objectives to 
experimentally identify  the possible removal mechanisms of CIP by Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles . Desorption tests were performed  at different initial pH (e.g., 5, 7, 9, and 
11) as depicted in section 2.5.3.1  to distinguish the contribution of adsorption and 
oxidation in the removal of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles.  Figure 3.7 illustrates  that after 
180 min of CIP removal, the molecules of CIP started to desorb from the surface of the 
reacted Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles after moving them to the desorbing solution (1 M NaOH) 
at 25 °C. The equilibrium of the desorption was quickly attai ned after approximately 30 
min. Moreover, it can be noticed from Figure 3.7 that the initial pH of the solution during 
the adsorption can slightly af fect the desorption of CIP from the surface of Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles. For instance, 32.63% (39.2084 mg L-1) of the total adsorbed molecules of 
CIP (94.813 mg L-1) at pH = 5 w ere desorbed back to the aqueous solution. In contrast, 
the desorption percentage  increased to 43.92%, 38.62%, and 43.92% when the initial pH 
elevated to 7, 9, and 11, respectively. Since the molecules of CIP were easily desorbed 
from the surface of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles, the percentages mentioned above  could  
represent the proportion of the weak physisorption from the total removal  efficiency ,  
 60 
 Chapter  3  
 
Figure 3.7 Desorption of CIP molecules after the adsorption by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles under different initial pH.  The 
adsorption parameters  were  as follows : [Mg/Fe0] = 0.5 g L-1, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, temperature = 25 °C, and contact 
time = 180 min .  
as displayed in  Figure 3.8.a [210,211] . The neutral and alkaline pH promoted the 
development of iron oxides on the surface of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles , as displayed  in the 
XRD patterns of the spent Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles ( Figure 3.4). Gu and Karthikeyan stated  
that the antibiotic  CIP could be removed by aluminum an d iron hydrous oxides [212] . 
Hence , the presence of iron oxides under neutral and alkaline conditions might  be the 
reason behind the increase in physisorption proportion under these conditions.  
The unknown  part of the total removal efficiency could be either oxidation or chemical 
adsorption. The contribution of oxidation in the removal of CIP was defined by 
conducting batch experiments with the addition of 20 m l of 2-propanol to inhibit the 
possible generat ion of any oxidizing radicals (i.e., hydroxyl radicals) in the system. Figure 
3.8.b indicates  that adding  2-propanol didn’t  impede the exceptional performance  of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in removing CIP under different initial pH. These results  confirm  
that the oxidation of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles is impossible, and chemisorption is the 
alternative mechanism .  XRD analysis for Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles afte r the reaction with 
CIP at different initial pH was conducted to support the experimental results. Figure 3.4 
manifests that the XRD patterns of the spent Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles over the studied pH 
range  had several peaks identified as organic by -products related to CIP.

 Chapter  3  
Figure 3.8 : (a) Contribution of physisorpt ion and chemisorption  in the adsorption of CIP  at different initial pH and 
(b) removal of CIP with the addition of 2 -propanol under different initial pH .  
However, it is not appropriate to rely on these results to prove the occurrence of CIP 
oxidation because these by -products could be generated from the high temperature inside 
the XRD instrument during the analysis. Therefore, based on the results of the ba tch 
experiments, it can be said that the removal of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles was governed 
by both the physisorption and chemisorption proces ses. In addition, it is evident from 
these findings that CIP oxidation by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles didn’t occur. It is worth 
mentioning  that physisorption of CIP occurs on the high surface area of Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles due to  van der Waals forces or due to the electrostatic attraction between 
the opposite charges of CIP and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles [211] . On the other hand, 
chemisorption  happens when iron species form a bidentate co mplex with the oxygen 
atoms of the carboxylic and keto groups in the structure of CIP [213,214] .

 Chapter  3 3.6. Kinetics and isotherm analysis  
Section 3.5  proved experimentally that the elimination  of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles 
was completely controlled  by adsorption. Hence, it is essential  to perform k inetic s and 
isotherm  modeling for the adsorption of  CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles , as their findings 
could help to elaborate  on the nature of the adsorption .  
Four kinetic models , namely, Pseudo  first-order , Pseudo  second -order , intraparticle 
diffusion , and Elovich models, were used to represent  the kinetic s data. The outcomes  of 
kinetic s analysis  and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) are epitomiz ed in Table 3.1 
and Figure 3.9. Figure 3.9 articulate s that the reaction between Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles and 
CIP in wat er was fast where the equilibrium was reached only after 10 min of starting the 
reaction despite changing the initial concentration from 50 to 200 mg L-1. In addition, 
Table 3.1 indicates strong competition between Pseudo -first-order  and Pseudo -second -
order  models to describe the kinetics of CIP adsorption  by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles because 
of the high convergence between the experimental and the obtained data as well as the 
high R2 for both models. Although Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)  was applied  to 
select  the best fitted kinetic model, the displayed AIC value s in Table 3.1 for the two 
models are also close to each other. This conclusion recommends that the adsorption  of 
CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles was possibly controlled by both physisorption and 
chemisorption proces ses [179,180] . This suggestion agrees  with the outcomes of the 
desorption experiments ( Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8). In contrast , intraparticle diffusion 
and Elovich models were exclud ed from the kinetic analysis due to  the high values of 
AIC, low values of R2, and misrepresentation of the experimental data , as stated in Figure 
3.9 and Table 3.1. 
Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin -Radushkevich isotherm models  were 
utilized  to describe  the equilibrium data , as manifested  in Figure 3.10 and Table 3.2. From 
Table 3.2, the Freundlich  isotherm model owns the lowest AIC value (57. 05), which 
suggests  the occurrence of multilayer adsorption of CIP on the heterogen eous surface of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles [185] . Since the value of (1/n) is greater than unity (i.e. , 1.426), it 
indicates  that the elimination  of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles was govern  by a cooperative 
adsorption process [184] . The results of isotherm analysis are consistent with the 
conclusions of kinetics analysis.

Figure 3.10 Isotherm analysis for CIP adsorption  by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. Adsorption  conditions were as follows : 
[Mg/Fe0] = 0.5 g L-1, initial pH = 5, temperature = 25 °C, [CIP] = (50–200) mg L-1, and contact time = 240 min.  
3.7. Effect of t emperature and thermodynamic analysis  
The impact  of temperature on the performance of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  in removing  
different concentrations of CIP was studied  by gradually increasing the temperature  of 
reaction  from 25 to 55 °C , as exhibited  in Table 2.2 and Figure 3.11. Figure 3.11 reveals 
that the progressive rise of temperature from 25 to 55 °C negatively  affected  the 
adsorption  of 100 mg L-1 of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles because the removal efficiency 
decreased  from 95.04% to 72.87%. This confirms  that the reaction between CIP and 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles was exothermic.

 Chapter  3  
Figure 3.11 Impact  of temperature on the adsorption  of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. Adsorption  conditions were as 
follows:  [Mg/Fe0] = 0.5 g L-1, initial pH = 5, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, and contact time = 240 min.  
Thermodynamic analysis was performed as described in section 2. 8.5 to give more 
insights  into the reaction  nature  between CIP and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. Figure 3.12 
displays the application of Van't Hoff equation [Equation (2.28)] to obtain the values of 
𝛥𝐻0 and 𝛥𝑆0. The coefficient of determination (R2) after the application of Van't Hoff 
equation  was 0.9996 , as demonstrated in Figure 3.12. However, it is essential  to point out 
that the experimental data of CIP adsorption at 45 °C were excluded from the 
thermodynamic analysis because it significantly decreased the value of R2. Afterwards, 
the 3rd principle of thermodynamics [ Equation (2.27)] was employed to determine the 
magnitudes of 𝛥𝐺0 at different reaction temperatures. The magnitudes of thermodynamic 
parameters were  summarized  in Table 3.3. The negative value of 𝛥𝐻0 suggests that the 
reaction between CIP and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles was exothermic [195] . Moreover , since 
the magnitude of 𝛥𝐻0 (i.e. -172.994) is between 80 and 200 KJ mol-1, it elucidate s that 
the adsorption of CIP was controlled  by a chemical adsorption  process [196] . 
Furthermore , Table 3.3 illustrates  that the sign of 𝛥𝐺0 in all temperatures is negative 
which proves the spontaneity of the reaction between CIP and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles 
[215] .   On the other hand, the negative sign of 𝛥𝑆0 tells that the randomness at the solid -
liquid interface and the degree of freedom of the adsorbed molecules of CIP were 
decreasing during the adsorption process [199] . Similar findings were reported by Wang 
et al.  when they attempted  to remediate  CIP from polluted waters  using Mg(OH) 2 powder 
[199] .

3.8. Reusability  of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles for many  adsorption  cycles  
One of the bigge st challenges for adsorption technology in wastewater treatment 
applications is sludge generation after treatment. However, recycling of adsorbent s for 
several adsorption processes reduces the volume of the generated sludge after the 
treatment. Therefore, Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles were reused  for five successive  adsorption 
processes. It is important to highlight  that the time for CIP adsorption and desorption was 
considerably decreased from 240 min (Adsorption) and 180  min (Desorption) to only 60 
min as the resu lts of the adsorption and desorption kinetics ( Sections 3.5  and 3.6) 
demonstrated  that the equilibrium time for these processes was one hour.  Figure 3.13 
manifest s the successful recycling of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles for five sequent adsorption 
cycles with no deterioration in the removal efficiency.  
 
 
 69 
 Chapter  3  
Figure 3.13 Reusability  of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles for several  treatment  cycles . Adsorption  conditions  were as follows : 
[Mg/Fe0] = 0.5 g L-1, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, volume of solution: 1L, temperature = 25 °C, and contact time = 60 min. 
Deso rption conditions  were as follows : desorption medium : 1M NaOH, volume of solution: 200 m l, temperature: 
25°C, mixing speed = 1000 rpm, and desorption time = 60 min.  
In other words, Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles exhibited an excellent  performance in eliminating  
CIP with removal efficiencies higher than 95% during the five treatment cycles where 0.5 
g of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles w ere able to treat 5 L of 100 mg L-1 of CIP-polluted  water.  It 
also can be anticipated  from Figure 3.13 that Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles can endure more than 
five adsorption cycles . This  reflects the suitability of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in field -scale 
applications as t hey can significantly reduce the volume of the generated sludge and most 
importantly the treatment cost.  
3.9.Performance of Mg/Fe0 in a prototype treatment system  
At this stage of the research, the outcomes of the optimization process were applied to 
design and fabricate, for the first time, a prototype lab -scale treatment system  to treat 
large volumes of CIP-polluted  water.  Figure 2.3 shows  the schematic diagram  of the 
proposed treatment system.  In addition, Table 3.4 illustrates that three treatment cycles 
were operated under the optimal conditions, but with changing the flow rate from 25 to 
75 m l min-1 to investigate the flow rate's effect on the competence of treatment system .

Figure 2.3 also demonstrates  that the chemical characteristics of water that flows out from 
the reactor, separation unit, aeration tank , and sand filtration column are noted as U1, U2, 
U3 and U4, respectively. Figure 3.14 summarizes the results  of the treatment process in 
the three cy cles. In the first cycle, the reactor (U1) showed a  remarkable performance in 
removing more than 94% of CIP in the first hour of operation ( Figure 3.14.a). However, 
the efficiency of the reactor started to deteriorate with time due to the continuous flow of 
the polluted  water until it reached approximately 30% at the end of the treatment process. 
This trend indicates that the adsorption  sites of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles were fully occupied 
with the molecules of CIP, and no extra molecules can be adsorbed on the surface of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. On the other hand, the separation unit (U2) and aeration tank (U3) 
did not contribute to the removal process because they were only designed to separate the 
solid particles f rom the water and produce clean effluents. In contrast, the sand f iltration 
column (U4) exhibited an unexpected and extraordinary performance in removing the 
residues of CIP from water, although it was only designed to remove the discharged 
particles from the separation unit and the aeration tank. Figure 3.14.a indicates  that the 
sand filtration unit removed  more than 50% of CIP  in the fifth hour of operation. This 
percentage gradually increased to approximately 65% a t the end of the treatment process 
due to  the exhaustion of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in the reactor (U1). Our p revious article 
proved that the utilized sand in the filtration column had some zeolite impurities [147] . 
In addition, several researchers reported that CIP could be adsorbed by zeolitic materials 
[216,217] . Thus, the presence of zeolite impurities in the sand is responsible for the 
exceptional capability of the sand filtration column in removing the rest of CIP 
concentration.  Figure 3.14.b and Figure 3.14.c demonstrate that increasing the flow rate 
from 25 to 50 and 75 mL min-1 accelerated the depletion of the reactivity o f Mg/Fe0  
 71 
 Chapter  3 nanoparticles in the reactor (U1) , where the removal  efficiency of CIP decreased from 
94.25% to 56.94% and 42%, respectively, within the first hour of the treatment process.  
 
Figure 3.14 Competence  of the prototype treatment system in the elimination  of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. The 
treatment  parameters were as follows: flow rate: (a) 25, (b) 50 and (c) 75 mL min-1, [CIP]: 100 mg L-1, volume of 
CIP-polluted  water = 10 L, [Mg/Fe0]: 0.5 g L-1, temperature: 25 °C and mixing speed: 250 rpm.   
 
 72 
 Chapter  3 Similar to the first cycle, a further decline in the reactor’s efficiency (U1) was noticed  in 
the later stages due to the continual inflow of CIP-polluted  water. Despite the poor 
performance of the reactor (U1), the sand filtration column (U4) succeeded in  rejecting 
the residual concentrations of CIP and generating  pure water , which can be directedly 
released to any surface water bodies without any further treatment. In summary, the 
optimum flow rate of the prototype treatment system is 25 m l min-1 to exten d the life span 
of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in the reactor. Furthermore, this flow rate will elongate the 
lifetime of the sand column and reduce the required times for cleaning or changing the 
sand inside the column. In the end, it is evident from Figure 3.14 that the components of 
the proposed treatment system could  achieve  100% overall removal efficiency of CIP and 
generate clean water with no residues of CIP. These results are promising ; howeve r, it is 
vital to investigate the performance of the prototype treatment system in removing CIP 
from pharmaceutical wastewater, hospital wastewater as well as the effluents of 
traditional wastewater treatment plants as they contain many other contaminants which 
may decrease the efficiency of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in removing CIP [218] . Also, it is 
crucial  to estimate the cost of using Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles and the prototype treatment 
system in real -scale applications. However, it is difficult to assess  the cost of the treatment 
process at this stage because many factors w ill affect the overall cost , such as the volume 
of polluted  water, required amounts of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles, and location of the 
contaminated sites (i.e. , Transportation cost of equipment and materials) [218] . 
3.10.  Storage and transportation of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  
It is essential  to study  the effect of storage time and storage conditions on the adsorption 
of CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles to reveal  the applicability of employing  Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles in remediating real contaminated sites. Figure 3.15.a elucidates that storing 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in empty containers at room temperature for 10 and 30 days 
insignificantly decreased the removal of CIP from 94.39% to 92.48% and 90.99%, 
respectively. The prolongated reactivity of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles is attributed to the 
presence of a magnesium hydroxide shell on the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles as it 
preserves the core of Fe0 nanoparticles from the fast oxidation over time [200,219] . Hu et 
al. declared that encapsulating Fe0 nanoparticles with a magnesium hydroxide shell would 
decrease th e corrosion of Fe0 nanoparticles to less than 3%  [220] .  
 73 
 Chapter  3  
Figure 3.15  Longevity test s for Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  stored in  (a) empty bottles, and (b) different mediums  for 30 
days.  
Furthermore, Figure 3.15.b shows that storing Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in ethanol for 30 
days preserved their excellent efficiency towards CIP elimination from water. These 
results are in good agreement with the results of Ahmed et al.  as they stored Fe0 
nanoparticles in ethanol for 10 months and used  it to remove  lead ( Pb2+) from water [221] . 
They revealed that storing  Fe0 nanoparticles particles for a long time in ethanol didn’t 
show any significant changes in the morphology or the crystalline structure of Fe0 
nanoparticles . Furthermore, they reported that the efficiency of Fe0 nanoparticles towards 
removing  lead from the water wasn’t  affected by the storing condition. However, Figure 
3.15.b indicates that 17.48% and 21.15% of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticle’s efficiency were 
sacrificed when the  nanoparticles were stocked for 30 days in deionized water (DIW) and 
the mixture of deionized water and ethanol, respectively. These results manifest that a 5% 
 
 74 
 Chapter  3 coating ratio of [Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] wasn’t sufficient to protect the core of Fe0 nanoparticles 
from the aggressive aqueous corrosion. Hence, Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles can be  easily 
transported from the production facility to the contaminated locations by storing them in 
well-closed containers w ith no liquid mediums. However, if it is intended to utilize  
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles after a long time, it is preferred to store them in ethanol to achieve 
better performance.  
3.11.  Comparison between the performance of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles and 
other  reported  iron-based nanomaterials  
The superiority of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in removing CIP from the water was highlighted  
by making a reliable comparison between the performance of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles and 
some of the reported iron -based nanomaterials in the literature , as summarized  in Table 
3.5. It is evident  from Table 3.5 that Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles exhibit remarkable removal 
efficiencies compared with most of the reported iron -based nanomaterials under similar 
treatment conditions. In addition, Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles promote the exceptional uptake 
of CIP from water without the need for external magnetic fields that may increase th e cost 
of the treatment process or hinder their application in real contaminated sites [106,125] .

 Chapter  3 3.12.  Economic Evaluation of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles for environmental 
remediation  
One of the challenges of nanomaterials in water and wastewater treatment applications is 
the high cost of nanomaterial synthesis. Therefore, it is essential to ensure th at the 
treatment cost of CIP -polluted water by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles is mo re cost-effective than  
that of Fe0 nanoparticles. This section compares the treatment cost of 100 mg L-1 of CIP -
polluted water by Fe0 and Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  by taking into consideration only the cost 
of the nanomaterial synthesis . At the same time,  the other parameters (e.g., energy, labor, 
transportation, etc.) are assumed to be constant . According to Figure 4.7.a, 0.7 g L-1 of 
Fe0 nanoparticles  was necessary to treat 100 mg L-1 of CIP -polluted water with 96.10% 
removal efficiency. On the other hand,  Figure 3.5.b illustrates that 0.4 g L-1 of Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles was enough to remediate 95.35%  of 100 mg L-1 of CIP -polluted water.  
Table 3.6  show s the estimation cost for treating 1 L of 100 mg L-1 of CIP by Fe0 and 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles. The cost of employing Fe0 nanoparticles to remediate CIP -polluted 
water is around 65.72 ¥/L. In contrast, as demonstrated in  Table 3.6 , the utilization of 
Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles increases the treatment cost o f CIP -polluted water to nearly 
88.51 ¥/L. This increase (i.e., 34.68%) is associated with the use of ethanol in preparing  
Mg2+ and NaOH stock solutions , as the cost of 1L of ethanol is approximately 2395.5 6¥. 
Therefore, to decrease the cost of producing Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles and the overall 
treatment process, it is recommended to examine the utilization of deionized water or 
distilled water instead of ethanol. However, it is essential  to highlight that Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles were reused for at least five treatment cycles with a trivial drop in 
performance ( Figure 3.13) which would significantly decrease the o verall treatment cost 
of CIP -polluted water. Conversely, Fe0 nanoparticles could n’t be recycled for several 
treatment processes, and it is required to produce new Fe0 nanoparticles for each treatment 
process.  Finally, according to the previous discussion,  it can be said that the utilization 
of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles to clean up CIP -polluted water is more cost -efficient than that of 
Fe0 nanoparticles.

4.1. Characterization of Fe0 nanoparticles with and without oxalate  
4.1.1.  Scanning electron microscopy -energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (SEM -EDS)  
Figure 4.1 shows the SEM images for Fe0 nanoparticles before and  after the reaction with 
oxalate in water.  Figure 4.1.a and Figure 4.1.b display that the fresh Fe0 nanoparticles 
had a spherical shape and tended to agglomerate and form a chain -like structure due to 
the magnetic attraction between Fe0 nanoparticles [222] . The chain -like structure and 
agglomeratio n deteriorate the performance of Fe0 nanoparticles because they decrease the 
surface area of Fe0 nanoparticles a nd the number of reactive sites on the surface of Fe0 
nanoparticles [223] . 
  
On the other hand , Figure 4.1.c reveals that beside s the spherical particles of Fe0, some 
particles with a flake -like structure or a needle -like structure were observed in the SEM 
of Fe0 nanoparticles after reacting with 0.3 mM of oxalate in water [224] . The 
development of flake -like structure particles is attributed to the formation o f iron oxide 
and hydroxide particles which results from the facilitated corrosion of Fe0 nanoparticles 
by oxalate [224] . Fe0 nanoparticles were furtherly oxidized, and the flake -like structure 
particles became more dominant and pronounced than the spherical particles after 
increasing the oxalate concentration from 0.3 mM to 0.5  mM (Figure 4.1.d), 1 mM 
(Figure 4.1.e), or 4 mM (Figure 4.1.f).  
 
Furthermore, e nergy -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was employed  to determine  the 
elemental composition of Fe0 nanoparticles before and after the reaction with different 
oxalate concentrations in water. Figure 4.2 manifest s that the surface of fresh Fe0 
nanop articles composed  of 86.04% iron and 13.96% oxygen.  Whereas  the percentage of 
iron on the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles gradually decreased from 86.04% to 66.77% . In 
comparison,  the oxygen ratio  progressively  increased from 13.96% to 33.23% after rising 
oxalate concentration in water from 0 to 4 mM. This proves that the addition of oxalate 
to Fe0 nanoparticles in aqueous solution  promoted the oxidation of Fe0 nanoparticles to 
iron oxides and hydroxides.

Reaction  parameters  were as follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 4 mM, volume of water = 200 m l, 
pH = 7, temperature = 25 ℃, stirring  speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.  
4.1.2.  X-ray diffraction (XRD)  
The crystalline structure of Fe0 nanoparticles before and after the interaction with 
different concentrations of oxalate in water was acquired  by X RD analysis [225,226] . 
Figure 4.3 demonstrates  that the two characteristic peaks of Fe0 were observed in the 
XRD pattern of fresh Fe0 nanoparticles at 2 θ = 44.7°  and 82.6°  which confirms the 
successful synthesis of Fe0 nanoparticles [227,228] . Mo reover, based on Scherrer’s 
equation, the synthesized Fe0 nanoparticles had a crystalline size of 3.64 nm.   
The XRD patterns of the reacted Fe0 nanoparticles illustrated that the strength of the 
distinctive peaks of Fe0 considerably weakened after the reaction with 0.3 and 0.5 mM of 
oxalate, and they completely vanished after rising the oxalate concentration in water to 1 
and 4 mM ( Figure 4.3). Furthermore, the presence of 0.3, 0.5, and 1 mM of oxalate in 
water mainly promoted the oxidation of Fe0 nanoparticles to magnetite (Fe₃O₄) as several 
peaks corresponding to magnetite appeared in XRD patterns at 2 θ = 30.29° , 35.75° , 
43.46° , 57.47° , and 62.96°  [229] . Notably,  the strength of magnetite peaks increased 
when the oxalate concentration in water increased from 0.3 to 1 mM ( Figure 4.3).  86.04

Figure 4.3 XRD analysis  for Fe0 nanoparticles before and after the reaction with different oxalate concentrations 
water. Reaction  parameters  were as follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 4 mM, volume of water = 
200 mL, pH of water = 7, temperature = 25 ℃, stirring  speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.  
On the other hand, Figure 4.3 exhibits that 4 mM of oxalate favored the corrosion of Fe0 
nanoparticles to l epidocrocite  [FeO(OH)]  as many l epidocrocite  peaks were detected in 
the XRD pattern of [Fe0 + 4 mM oxalate] at 2θ = 14.16 °, 27.13°, 36.40°, 38.16 °, 47.03 °, 
52.77 °, 60.56°, and 80.36 ° [230,231] . The results of SEM -EDS, and XRD confirmed  that 
the existence of oxalate in water progressively oxidized Fe0 nanoparticles, and these 
outcomes are in good agreement with the findings of Wang et al.  [224] . 
4.1.3.  Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)  
The chemistry of Fe0 nanoparticle’s surface was investigated using FTIR analysis within 
a wavenumber ranging  from 500 to 3000 cm-1. Figure 4.4 presents  the FTIR spectrum for 
Fe0 nanoparticles before and after the reaction with various oxalate concentrations in 
water. Two stretching vibration s around 548 cm-1 and 621 cm-1 were observed in the FTIR 
spectrum of fresh Fe0 nanoparticles , which correspond to the bands of magnetite ( Fe3O4) 
and maghemite ( Fe2O3) [232] . The intensity of these bands  noticeably evolved after Fe0 
nanoparticles reacted with different concentrations of oxalate in water.

 Chapter  4  
Figure 4.4 FTIR analysis for Fe0 nanoparticles before and after the reaction with different oxalate concentrations in 
water. Reaction  parameters  were as follows:  [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 4 mM, volume of water = 
200 mL, pH  of water  = 7, temperature = 25 °C, stirring  speed = 500 rpm , and reaction  time = 30 min . 
This may result from the formulation of iron -oxalate complexation on the surface of Fe0 
nanoparticles [224] . Also, Figure 4.4 displays that the saturation band of carbon dioxide 
(CO 2) was developed around 2359 cm-1 after the reaction of Fe0 nanoparticles with oxalate 
[232] . However, the dist inctive C=O band of oxalate around 1630  cm-1 wasn’t detectable 
in the FTIR spectrum of Fe0 nanoparticles after the interaction with low concentrations 
of oxalate, e.g., 0.3 and 0.5 mM [137] . On the contrary, when the concentration of oxalate 
was increased to 1 and 4 mM, the absorption band of C=O i n oxalate appeared in the 
FTIR spectrum, as exhibited in Figure 4.4. 
4.1.4.  Particle size, specific surface area , and point of zero charge of Fe0 
nanoparticles  
The particle size distribution (PSD) of fresh Fe0 nanoparticles was obtained by laser 
diffraction particle size analyzer. Figure 4.5 illustrates  the PSD of Fe0 nanoparticles , 
where the average diameter of Fe0 nanoparticles was 45.90 nm. Furthermore , the PSD 
analysis emphasize d that 25%, 50% , and 75% of Fe0 nanoparticles had a particle size of 
less than 32.52 nm, 45.86 nm, and 64.78 nm, respectively.  Moreover , the specific surface 
area analysis manifest ed that the SSA BET of Fe0 nanoparticles was 57.51 m² g-1, consistent 
 
 85 
 Chapter  4 with the previous studies [233] . Also, Figure 4.6 shows that the pH (PZC)  of Fe0 and 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles were 8.22 and 8, respectively. Hence , it can be anticipated that 
the surface of Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles were positively charged in the aqueous 
solution when the pH was less than ~8. In contrast, the surface of Fe0 and (F e0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles were negatively charged when the pH of the solution was higher than ~8 
[234] .

 Chapter  4 4.2. Comparison between Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate)  nanoparticles  
The effectiveness  of Fe0 nanoparticles alone (Fe0 system) in remediating  CIP-polluted 
water  was initially evaluated by varying Fe0 dosage from 0.1 to 1.1 g L-1 (Table 2.3). 
Figure 4.7 shows that 0.1 g L-1 of Fe0 nanoparticles remove d less than 32% of 100 mg L-
1 of CIP from aqueous solutions  after 30 min  of reaction .  
 
Figure 4.7 CIP removal by (a) Fe0 and (b) [Fe0/oxalate]. Reaction  parameters  were as follows:  [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, 
[Fe0] = 0.5 g L-1, [Oxalate] = 0.5 mM, pH = 7, temperature  = 25 ⁰C, stirring  speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 
min. 
 
 87 
 Chapter  4 This percentage was gradually enhanced  to 45.04% and 76.95% by increasing the dosage 
of Fe0 nanoparticles to 0.3g L-1 and 0.5 g L-1. However, it is important to mention that the 
unstable performance of Fe0 nanoparticles at these concentrations (i.e., 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 
g L-1) led to significant desorption of CIP after extending the reaction time to 120 min 
(Data not shown). On the other hand , increasing the Fe0 dosage to 0.7 g L-1 remarkably  
improved and str engthened the competence  of Fe0 nanoparticles as more than 96% of CIP 
was eliminated  within 30 min (Figure 4.7.a). It is also evident that the excessi ve addition 
of Fe0 nanoparticles, for example , 0.9 and 1.1 g L-1, slightly declined the removal 
efficiency of CIP to 94.68% (Figure 4.7.a). This unexpected performance could result 
from the high aggregation of Fe0 nanoparticles at high concentrations , which in turn 
decrease s the surface area and the available reactive sites o f Fe0 nanoparticles. Hence, 
according to  Figure 4.7, the optimum dosage for Fe0 nanoparticles  is 0.7 g L-1. On the 
other hand, Figure 4.7.b confirm s that adding  0.5 mM of oxalate boosted the performance  
of 0.5 g L-1 of Fe0 nanoparticles in remediating CIP -polluted  waters . For instance, after 
the addition of 0.5 mM of oxalate, the removal efficiency of CIP by 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 g L-
1 was improved  from 31.91% to 77.09%, 45.05% to 93.27%, and 76.95% to 94.94%, 
respectively (Figure 4.7.b). Furthermore , slight improvements in the removal efficiency 
of CIP were noticed  after adding 0.5 mM of oxalate to 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1 g L-1 of Fe0. 
Therefore, Figure 4.7 prove d that the addition of oxalate positively reduced the optimum 
Fe0 dosage from 0.7 g L-1 (Fe0 nanoparticles ) to 0.3 g L-1 [(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles ].  
As previously mentioned in Figure 4.7, the removal efficiency of CIP by Fe0 nanoparticles  
and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles was likewise enhanced  by in creasing the dosage of Fe0 
nanoparticles. This can be explained by two hypotheses as follows: (1) if the adsorption 
of CIP occurs, the addition of more Fe0 in the treatment system will provide additional 
reactive sites to uptake CIP from the aqueous solution , and (2) if the oxidation of CIP 
occurs, higher concentrations of Fe0 will generate more Fe2+ and H 2O2, consequently, 
produce more ROS in the system.  
Adding oxalate to Fe0 nanoparticles will form complexes with iron ions (Fe -oxalate 
complex). The formation of Fe -oxalate complexes will promote  the generation of ROS 
through various  mechanisms [96,146] . These mechanisms are summarized as follows:  
1. The reaction r ate of Fe2+-oxalate complexes with H 2O2 is 3 times faster than the 
reaction of bare Fe2+ with H 2O2. This means that the presence of oxalate will  
 88 
 Chapter  4 prefer  the consumption of H 2O2 by Fe2+ to produce more ROS [Equation (1.5)] 
rather than transferring H 2O2 to water by Fe0 [Equation (1.2)]. 
2. The formation of Fe2+-oxalate complexes boots  the oxidation of Fe2+ by oxygen 
[Equation (1.3)] under acidic pH.  
3. Oxalate will form Fe3+-oxalate complexes , which will increase the solubility of 
Fe3+ ions and prevent the passivation of Fe0 nanoparticles. The formation of iron 
oxides and  hydroxides on the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles after the reaction with 
oxalate in water indicates that the addition of oxalate neither enhanced the 
solubility of Fe3+ nor prevented the passivation of Fe0 nanoparticles (Figure 4.1 
and Figure 4.2). Thus, this mechanism was not responsible for improv ing the  
eliminat ion of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) system.  
4. The formation of Fe -oxalate complexes can change the nature of the produced 
ROS. The responsible enhancement mechanism will be clarified in detail in 
section 4.11.  
4.3. Influence  of oxalate concentration  
The concentration of o xalate was varied  from 0.1 to 0.9 mM at three different Fe0 dosages 
(e.g., 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 g L-1) to identify  the optimum combination between Fe0 and oxalate 
that provides the best performance in remediating  CIP-polluted water ( Table 2.3). At the 
three dosages of Fe0 nanoparticles, increasing oxalate concentration from 0 to 0.3 mM 
improved  the removal efficiency of CIP , as illustrated  in Figure 4.8. For example, the 
addition of 0.3 mM of oxalate to 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 g L-1 of Fe0 promoted the removal 
efficiency of CIP from 31.91% to 65. 15%, 45.04% to 95.74%, and 76.95% to 96.80%, 
respectively. Nevertheless , it was found that adding oxalate with concentrations more 
than 0.3 mM moderately decreased the competence of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . For 
instance, the removal efficiency of CIP b y 0.3 g L-1 of Fe0 declined from 95.74% to 
90.90% after rising oxalate concentration from 0.3 to 0.9 mM (Figure 4.8.b). The 
excessive existence  of oxalate in water  could compete with CIP on either the adsorption 
sites of Fe0 nanoparticles or the generated ROS [235] . Therefore, based on Figure 4.8, the 
optimum removal efficiency of CIP was 95.74% , and this percentage was achieved by 
adding 0.3 mM of oxalate to 0.3 g L-1 of Fe0 nanoparticles. This combination of Fe0 and 
oxalate (i.e., 0.3 g L-1 and 0.3 mM) was applied in the following experiments.    
 89 
 Chapter  4  
Figure 4.8 Influence  of oxalate concentration at different dosages of Fe0 nanoparticles:  (a) 0.1 g L-1, (b) 0.3 g L-1, 
and (c) 0.5 g L-1. Other reaction  parameters  were as follows: [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, pH = 7, temperature  = 25 ⁰C, 
stirring  speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.  
 
 90 
 Chapter  4 4.4. Effect of dissolved oxygen concentration  
The effect  of dissolved oxygen  on the removal of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was 
exami ned by carrying out  three s eparate batch experiments with three different aeration 
conditions as follows: the first flask was open to the atmosphere ; meanwhile, the second 
flask was continuously supplied with air using an air pump, and the last flask was purged 
with pure nitrogen  gas (N2) during the entire  experiment. Air and nitrogen gas were 
supplied at a flow rate of 30 ml min-1. Figure 4.9 exhibits  that more than 95% of 100 mg 
L-1 of CIP was effectively removed  by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles when the flask was 
open to the atmosphere. Furthermor e, the competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was 
trivially improved to approximately 97.69% when a constant supply of N 2 was provided 
during the treatment process.  Conversely , the presence of excessive dissolved oxygen in 
the aqueous solution during t he removal of CIP diminished the performance of 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles to 67.47%. Peng  et al.  reported similar results  where they 
observed  that the degradation of nitrobenzene  by (Fe0/oxalate) under various aeration 
conditions was in the following order: 100% (N 2) > 95% (without aeration) > 85% (O 2) 
[96]. In addition to Peng et al. , Yin et al. demonstrated that the anoxic condition (N 2) was 
more preferable  for nitrobenzene  reduction by zerovalent iron than the oxic conditions 
(e.g., air or O 2) [236] . 
 
Figure 4.9 Effect of dissolved oxygen content on the effectiveness  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  in treating  CIP-
polluted  solution s. Reaction  parameters  were as follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, , [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3 mM 
pH = 7, temperature  = 25 ⁰C, stirring  speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.  
 
 91 
 Chapter  4 Based on the  responsible removal mechanism, there are two possible explanations for the 
performance of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  under different aeratio n conditions. If the 
oxidation of CIP is dominant, the existence of an excellent electron acceptor such as 
dissolved oxygen in the polluted  water will strongly compete with CIP for the released 
electrons from the core of Fe0 nanoparticles during the treatm ent [236] .  However, if 
adsorption is the main  removal mechanism, providing excessive molecules of oxygen will 
promptly oxidize Fe0 nanoparticles and severely decrease the adsorption power of Fe0 
nanoparticles. Since there were no significant differences between purging N 2 or open ing 
to the atmosphere, the flasks were open to the atmosphere in the rest of the batch 
experiments.  
4.5. Influence  of initial pH  
The pH of the solutio n manipulates the surface charge of Fe0 nanoparticles as shown  in 
the determination of pH (PZC) (Figure 4.6) [234] . Moreover, changing the pH of the 
solution will change the dominant species of CIP in the aqueous solution  [237] . For 
example , at acidic pH ( pH < pK a1 = 6.1 ), most of CIP molecules will be cationic ( CIP+). 
On the other hand, at neutra l pH (pK a1 = 6.1 < pH < pK a2 = 8.4)  and alkaline pH ( pH > 
pKa2 = 8.4 ), the majority of CIP molecules will be zwitterionic (CIP±) and anionic ( CIP⁻), 
respectively. In other words, the pH of the solution will affect the interaction between 
CIP and (Fe0/oxala te) nanoparticles . In addition, the generation of ROS by Fe0 
nanoparticles is highly dependent on the pH of the solution [238] . Therefore, it was 
necessary to study the impact  of the initial pH of water  on the elimination  of CIP by 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . The initial pH of the  polluted  solution was increased  from 3 
to 11 , as exhibited  in Table 2.3 and Figure 4.10. The addition of 0.3 mM of oxalate 
completely dissolved  Fe0 nanoparticles at pH 3 ; thus, the elimination  of CIP from a 
strong ly acidic solution by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles was unsuccessful (Figure 4.10). 
However, the removal efficiency of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was notably  
enhanced  to 88.67% after increasing the initial pH of the solution to 5 (Figure 4.10). 
Surprisingly, Figure 4.10 confirms  that 95.43% of 100 mg L-1 of CIP was eliminated 
within 10 min at neutral pH (e.g., pH 7). In contrast, the moderate and strong alkaline pH 
(i.e., pH 9 and pH 11) reduced the remediat ion of CIP-polluted water  to 88.48% and 17%, 
respectively (Figure 4.10). The addition of low concentration of oxalate (0.3 mM) and the 
poor performanc e of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  under acidic pH (i.e., pH 3) could 
initially  indicate that the oxidation of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  didn’t occur.   
 92 
 Chapter  4  
Figure 4.10 Effect of initial pH on the competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . Reaction  conditions were as 
follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3 mM, pH = 3 -11, temperature  = 25 ⁰C, mixing speed = 
500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.  
The findings of previous researchers can support this hypothesi s. Most of the previous 
articles indicated  that the optimum pH for oxidizing  organic pollutants  by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles  was acidic  [239] . For instance , Peng et al.  manifested that pH 3 was the 
optimum pH for nitrobenzene oxidation  by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  [96]. Also, Kong 
et al.  showed that pH 3 boosted  the oxidation of phenol by sulfidated zerovalent iron  
(SnZVI) with the existence  of oxalate and tripolyphosphate  [146] . In addition , most of 
the articles demonstrated  that adding considerable amounts of oxalate is essential  to 
stimulate the oxidation of organic contaminants [96]. For example , Keenan and Sedlak 
illustrated  that 10 mM of oxalate was needed  to promote t he oxidation of organic 
pollutants  by (Fe0/O2) nanoparticles  [135] . Moreover , Kong et al.  reported  that 15 mM of 
oxalate was required  to accelerate the degradation of phenol by SnZVI [146] . 
4.6. Desorption experim ents 
Desorption experiments were performed  after the elimination  of CIP at initial pH = 5, 7, 
and 9 to define  the contribution of adsorption and oxidation from the total removal 
efficiency of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . Deionized water with differe nt pH , such 
as pH = 3, 5, and 12, was utilized  in the desorption experiments , as manifested  in section 
2.5.3.2  and Figure 4.11.  
 
 93 
 Chapter  4  
Figure 4.11 Desorption of CIP  molecules  after adsorption by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  at initial pH  of: (a) 5, (b) 7, 
and (c) 9, using three desorption solutions with different pH such as pH = 3, pH = 5, and pH =12.  
 
 94 
 Chapter  4 After removing  CIP at initial pH of 5, 100% of the eliminated  CIP molecules were 
desorbed back into the acidic deionized water (pH = 3) after 24h ( Figure 4.11.a). 
However, approximately 80% and 60% of the removed CIP were desorbed back into 
deionized water with pH = 5 and pH =12, respectively (Figure 4.11.a). On the other hand, 
after the elimination  of CIP at initial pH of 7, 42.67%, 61.13%, and 27.51% of the total 
removed CIP were desorbed back into the deionized water with pH = 3, 5, and 12, 
respectively (Figure 4.11.b). Whilst after the removal of CIP at initial pH  of 9, 58.40%, 
31.09%, and 18.59% of the total removed CIP were desorbed int o the deionized water 
with pH = 3, 5, and 12, respectively (Figure 4.11.c). Since the complete  desorption wasn’t 
achieved within 24 h for initial pH 7 and 9, as displayed  in (Figure 4.11.b ) and ( Figure 
4.11.c ), the desorption experiments were extended for 48 h. As anticipated , the complete 
desorption  of CIP molecules  for initial pH of 7 and 9 was  achieved  in the deionized water 
with pH = 5 and pH = 3, respectively (Data is not shown).  These results confirm  that the 
addition of 0.3 mM of oxalate to 0.3 g L-1 of Fe0 improved  the adsorption of CIP rather 
than oxidation.  
At pH 5, both CIP and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles will be positively charged ; however, 
at pH 9, CIP and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles will be negatively charged  (Figure 4.6) [212] . 
Therefore, the reduction in the removal efficiency of CIP at initial pH  = 5 and pH  = 9 
could  result from the electrostatic repulsion between the same charges of CIP and 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . On the contrary, the emergence  of a passivation layer a nd the 
electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged CIP and Fe0 could be responsible 
for the sever e reduction in the removal efficiency of CIP at pH 11. In conclusion, Fi gure 
4.10 elucidates that the optimum pH for removing  CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  is 
pH 7. This value was generalized in all experiments.  
4.7. Monitoring of the re lease of iron species  
The concentration of total dissolved iron, ferric , and ferrous was monitored during  the 
remediation  of CIP -polluted  water  at various  initial pH (e.g., 5, 7, 9, and 11) to evaluate  
the chelating effect  of oxalate. Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13 present the concentration of 
the released iron species throughout  the removal  of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) and Fe0 
nanoparticles , respectively. Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13 proved that the addition 0.3 mM  
of oxalate didn’t improve  the release of iron species during the removal of CIP at different 
initial pH. These outcomes  are in good agreement with the previous reports  [96].

 Chapter  4 4.8. Influence  of initial ciprofloxacin  concentration and isotherm analysis  
The effect  of CIP initial concentration on the efficacy  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was 
assessed  by increasing CIP initial concentration from 10 to 100 mg L-1 as presented  in 
Table 2.3. Surprisingly, Figure 4.14 illustrates  that only 65.28% of 10 mg L-1 of CIP was 
treated by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . However, the performance of (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles  was greatly enhanced  to 95.75% after increasing CIP 's initial concentration 
to 100 mg L-1. The unsatisfied competence of (Fe0/oxalate) system in treating  low 
concentrations of CIP (i.e., 10, 30, and 50 mg L-1) can be explained by the fact that the 
less availability of CIP molecules in the aquatic  solution will negatively impact  the mass 
transfer rate of CIP from the solution to the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles and decrease the 
removal efficiency [240,241] . Banat et al.  also found that the elimination  of phenol by 
bentonite improved as the phenol concentration  increased [240] . The dosage of Fe0 
nanoparticles in (Fe0/oxalate) was increased from 0.3 to 0.5 and 0.7 g L-1 to determine  the 
optimum Fe0 dosages for remediating  specific ranges of CIP initial concentration. It 
should be noted that while changing the dosage of Fe0, the oxalate concentration was 
fixed (i.e., 0.3 mM) because Figure 4.8 emphasized  that increasing oxalate concentration 
to more than 0.3 mM wasn’t beneficial . Figure 4.14.b and Figure 4.14.c confirm ed that 
increasing the dosage of Fe0 to 0.5 and 0.7 g L-1 enhanced the removal  of different CIP 
concentrations by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . This enhancement was noticeable  in 
treating low concentrations of CIP. For instance , the removal efficiency of 10 mg L-1 of 
CIP was enhanced  from 65.28% to 71.83% and 73.96% after rising Fe0 dosage from 0.3 
to 0.5 and 0.7 g L-1, respectively. These findings  suggest that the optimum Fe0 in the 
(Fe0/oxalate) should be modified according to CIP initial concentration [CIP] as follows: 
0.7 g L-1 is the optimum Fe0 dosage when [CIP] < 50 mg L-1, whe reas 0.5 and 0.3 g L-1 
are the optimum Fe0 dosages when 50 mg L-1 ≤ [CIP] <100 mg L-1 and [CIP] ≥ 100 mg 
L-1, respectively.  
Isotherm analysis was conducted  to predict  the nature of CIP adsorption by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles . During the isotherm analysis , it was noted  that the trend of removing [CIP] 
≥ 100 mg L-1 is different from removing [CIP] ≤ 70 mg L-1. This difference could be due 
to the occurrence of different  adsorption mechanisms depending on the initial CIP 
concentration. Therefore, it was decid ed to perform  the isotherm modeling  for [CIP] ≥ 
100 mg L-1 and [CIP] ≤ 70 mg L-1 separately .

(b) [Fe0] = 0.5 g L-1, and (c) [Fe0] = 0.7 g L-1. Other  reaction  parameters  were as follows: [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, 
[oxalate] = 0.3 mM, pH = 7, temperature  = 25 ⁰C, stirring  speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.   
 
 98 
 Chapter  4 It can be observed  from Figure 4.15 and Table 4.1 that the equilibrium data for the 
removal of [CIP] ≤ 70 mg L-1 is well represented by Sips isotherm model as it owns the 
lowest AIC value (e.g., 51.68 ) and the highest coefficient of determination  (R2 = 0.994) 
among the five used isotherm models. Also , Table 4.2 shows  that the calculated 
adsorption capacities from sips isotherm model is almost identical to the experimental 
adsorption capacities exce pt the adsorption capacity of removing 10 mg L-1 of CIP. Thus, 
the multilayer adsorption of low CIP concentrations ([CIP] ≤ 70 mg L-1) is predicted to 
occur on the heterogenous surface of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  [242] . It worth 
mentioning that a cooperative adsorption process could also be expected as t he inverse of 
the adsorption intensity (1/n = 4.023) of Freundlich  isotherm model is higher than 1 
(Table 4.1).  Furthermore , Table 4.3 articulate s that the adsorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles  is favorable as the separation factor ( RL) of Langmuir  isotherm at al l initial 
CIP concentrations is less than 1 [243,244] . In addition , Table 4.1 demonstrates  that the 
mean adsorption energy  of Dubinin -Radushkevich isotherm  (E) is 116.186 J mol-1 (E < 8 
kJ mol−1) which sug gests that the adsorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  is 
govern by physisorption [189] .

For the adsorption of high CIP concentrations (i.e., [CIP] ≥ 100 mg L-1), the Freundlich  
isotherm model was found to be the best model to describe  the experimental data as 
exhibited  in Figure 4.16, Table 4.4 as well as  Table 4.5.  The reciprocal  of adsorption 
intensity (1/n = 2.559 ) is larger than unity whi ch suggests  that cooperative adsorption is 
responsible for the multilayer adsorption of high concentrations of CIP on the 
heterogen eous surface of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles [245] . Furthermore,  Table 4.6 
illustrates  that the RL of Langmuir isotherm at all initial CIP concentrations  is less than 1 , 
suggesting  the adsorption of high CIP concentrations by (Fe0/oxalate) system is favorable.

 Chapter  4 4.9. Influence  of contact time and kinetics analysis  
The effect of contact time was investigated  by increasing  the reaction  time from 0 to 30 
min, as shown  in Figure 4.14. Figure 4.14.a displays  that the (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  
at Fe0 dosage of 0.3 g L-1 quickly attained the equilibrium state after 10 min of starting 
the reaction when treating high concentrations of CIP (e.g., 50, 70, and 100 mg L-1). The 
presence  of excessive molecules of CIP in the aqueous solution facilitated the mass 
transfer of CI P to the solid phase , where the adsorption locations of (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles  were rapidly occupied within a short time (i.e., 10 min). This reflects the 
excellent  competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  in treating  high concentrations of 
CIP. In contrast , eliminating  low concentrations of CIP , such as 10 and 30 mg L-1 of CIP , 
need  more than 30 min to reach the equilibrium stage because of the slow mass transfer 
of low CIP molecules to the surface of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . It can be seen from 
Figure 4.14.b and Figure 4.14.c that increasing the concentration of Fe0 nanoparticles, in 
the (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles , to 0.5 and 0.7 g L-1 provided more reactive sites to target 
30 mg L-1 within 10 -20 min effectively . On the contrary , at all studied concentrations of 
Fe0 (i.e., 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 g L-1), more than 30 min are needed  to efficiently treat  10 mg 
L-1 of CIP or less . Since 100 mg L-1 of CIP was chosen  to study the effect of all other 
parameters, 30 min was selected  as an equilibrium time for  all experiments.  
Kinetics analysis for the treatment  of CIP -polluted  waters  by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  
was carried out  as dementated  in Figure 4.17 to predict  the controlling removal 
mechanism [246,247] . Pseudo -first-order, Pseudo -second -order, intraparticle diffusion, 
and Elovich  were applied to describe the  kinetics of CIP removal by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles . Table 4.7 as well as Figure 4.17 elucidate  that there is no single kinetic 
model to represent the removal of various CIP concentrations. For example , the kinetics 
of remo ving 10 mg L-1 by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  is well described by the Elovich 
model because it own s the lowest AIC value and the highest coefficient of determination 
(R2). However, the kinetics of removing 30, 50, and 70 mg L-1 of CIP are well fitted by 
the Pseudo -first-order  model. W hilst Pseudo second -order  model is the best model to 
represent the kinetics of eliminating 100 mg L-1 of CIP. These results confirms  that the 
effect of CIP initial concentration on the performance  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  is 
significant as it not only affects  the competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  but might 
also change the controlling removal mechanism.  For instance , it ca n be expected that 
adsorption of 10 and 100 mg L-1 of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  is chemisorption   
 104 
 Chapter  4 as their kinetics data are well fitted by Elovich and Pseudo second -order , respectively 
[176,248] . On the other hand, the uptake of 30, 50, and 70 mg L-1 of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles could b e controlled by physisorption (i.e., electrostatic attraction, V an der 
Waals forces , co-precipitation, etc.) since their kinetics data are best represented  by 
Pseudo first -order  model [249] .

The conclusions  of the kinetics analysis suggest  that physisorption and chemisorption  
were collaboratively responsible for the adsorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . 
This suggestion is consistent with the results  of the desorption experiments ( Figure 4.11) 
and the isotherm analysis.  
4.10.  Influence  of temperature an d thermodynamic analysis  
The effect of temperature on the removal of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was 
investigated  by rising  the temperature from 25 to 65 ℃. It is evident from Figure 4.18 
that the removal of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  prefers  the low temperatures. For 
example, the efficacy  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  at 25 ℃ was remarkable  as 95.50% 
of 100 mg L-1 of CIP was eliminated  within 5 min (Figure 4.18). However, a sign of 
deterioration in the performance  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was noted  after elevating 
the reaction temperature to 35 and 45 ℃ where the removal efficiency insignificantly  
 106 
 Chapter  4 dropped  from 95.50% to 93.58% and 90.28%, respectively ( Figure 4.18). In addition , the 
removal efficiency of CIP considerably decreased  to 75.78% and 63.12% because of  
rising the reaction temperature to 55 and 65 ℃ ( Figure 4.18). It can be inferred  from 
Figure 4.18 that the high reaction temperature pr ovides the required energy to break the 
formed adsorption bonds between CIP and the adsorptive sites on the surface of Fe0 
nanoparticles , as it can be observed that  at 65 ℃ the concentration of CIP in the aqueous 
solution started to increase after 10 min. These results  confirm the exothermic nature of 
CIP adsorption by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . The parameters of thermodynamics, 
namely 𝛥𝐻0, 𝛥𝑆0, and 𝛥𝐺0 were determined  by applying  Van’t Hoff  equation [ Equation 
(2.28)] and the 3rd principle in thermodynamics  [Equation (2.27)] as manifested  in section 
2.8.5 . Table 4.8 and Figure 4.19 summarize the outcomes  of thermodynamic analysis. 
Moreover , Table 2.7 and Table 2.8 epitomize  the interoperation of both the sign and the 
magnitude of thermodynamics parameters. The obtained  𝛥𝐺0 is negative at all reaction 
temperatures which indicates that the adsorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  
was favorable and spontaneous ( Table 4.8) [198] . Also , the negative sign of 𝛥𝐻0 suggests 
that the adsorption of CIP was exothermic, which is in  good agreement with the 
experimental results [213,247] .  
 
Figure 4.18  Effect of temperature on the competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . Reaction  parameters  were as 
follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3 mM, pH = 7, and 11, temperature  = 25, 35, 45, 55, and 
65 ⁰C, stirring  speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.

 Chapter  4 Furthermore , the negative value of 𝛥𝑆0 indicates  that the freedom of CIP molecules a nd 
the randomness at the surface of (Fe0/oxalate) decreased during the adsorption of CIP 
[250] . In addition to the sign, the absolute value 𝛥𝐺0 and 𝛥𝐻0 can emphasize  the type of 
CIP adsorption by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  (Table 2.7). The absolute value of 𝛥𝐺0 at 
all temperatures is less than 20 kJ mol-1 (2 kJ/mol  <𝛥𝐺0< 20 kJ/mol ). Consequently , the 
adsorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  could be physisorption [63]. However, 
the absolute magnitude of  𝛥𝐻0 is 51.1kJ mol-1 (20 kJ mol-1 <𝛥𝐻0 < 80 kJ mol-1) which 
implies that both physisorpti on and chemisorption  occurred  during the adsorption of CIP 
[251] . These results are consistent with the findings of Zhang  et al.  as they confirmed  that 
physisorption and chemisorption  both contributed to the adsorption of CIP by sulfate -
reducing bacteria sludge  because of the absolute value of 𝛥𝐻0 was 49.51 kJ  mol-1, 
although, the absolute value of 𝛥𝐺0 ranged from 8.05 to 12.09  kJ mol-1 [213] . The 
activation energy (E a) of CIP adsorption was obtained by the Arrhenius equation  (Figure 
4.19.b) to distinguish between the physisorption and chemisorption  processes. Table 4.8 
exhibits  that the calculated E a is 15.20  kJ mol-1, suggesting  that the adsorption of CIP 
might be controlled  by physical adsorption since E a lies between 5 and 50 kJ mol−1 
[197,252] . In conclusion, the  results  of the thermodynamic analysis are consistent with 
the results of isotherm and kinetics analysis.  
4.11.  Removal mechanism of ciprofloxacin  by (Fe0/oxalate)  
Figure 4.11 proved that the oxidation of CIP didn’t occur , and the  treatment  of CIP by 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was entirely governed by adsorption. It is important to 
mention that there are two types of adsorptions , namely physisorption and chemisorption. 
Physisorption occurs when CIP forms weak bonds with the surface of (Fe0/oxalate) such 
as van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding , electrostatic attraction, etc. [253] . On the 
contrary , chemisorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate ) nanoparticles  occurs when strong bonds 
are formed  [253] . It is also clear from Figure 4.11 that physisorption was more dominant 
at initial pH 5 because it was desorbed with a little bit of resistance. While chemisorption 
was more predominant  at initial pH  = 7 and pH  = 9 since a long time was needed to 
achieve the complete  desorption (i.e., 48h). Based on the strength of CIP desorption 
(Figure 4.11), it can be concluded that phys isorption and chemisorption  simultaneously 
occurred during the adsorption of  CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . These findings are 
consistent with the outcomes of kinetics, isotherm , and thermodynamics analysis.

 Chapter  4 To further clarify  the nature of CIP adsorption by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles , SEM -EDS, 
XRD, and FTIR analysis for the spend (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles after the adsorption of 
CIP at different initial pH (e.g., 5, 7, 9, and 11) were conducted .  Figure 4.20 shows  that 
the spherical particles of Fe0 were partially deformed after the reaction with CIP at 
different initial pH with the existence  of oxalate. Also , needle -shaped particles of iron 
oxides were also observed in the SEM images of spent (Fe0/oxalate)  nanoparticles . The 
development of needle -shape d iron oxides was confirmed by the identification of several 
peaks for magnetite (Fe 3O4) and lepidocrocite [FeO(OH)]  in the  XRD patterns of the 
reacted (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  at different initial pH ( Figure 4.21).  Gu and 
Karthikeyan stated  that CIP was efficiently removed by hydrous oxides of iron (HOF) 
[212] . Thus , the presence of needle -shape d particles of iron oxides could favor the 
excepti onal adsorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles .

(b) pH 7, (c) pH 9, and (d) pH 11. Other reaction  parameters  were as follows: [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, 
[oxalate ] = 0.3 mM, temperature = 25 ℃, stirring  speed = 500 r pm, and reaction  time = 30 min.

 Chapter  4 Moreover, Figure 4.22 demonstrates a clear  deterioration in the intensity  of the 
characteristic peak of Fe0 at 2θ = 44.7°  as well as noticeable  evolution of a new peak at 
2θ = 5° after the reaction of (Fe0/oxalate ) nanoparticles  with high CIP concentrations such 
as 200 and 400 mg L-1. These changes in the XRD pattern of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  
after the reaction with elevated CIP concentrations are additional signs of CIP adsorption. 
Jiang et al.  reported simil ar interpretations  after the adsorption of CIP by birnessite  [41]. 
Figure 4.23 presents  the FTIR spectrums of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles after the reaction 
with 100 mg L-1 of CIP at different initial pH (e.g., 5, 7, 9, and 11). The FTIR spectrum 
of CIP powder is complicated, as shown  in Figure 4.23.a, because of the huge  number of 
functional groups in the structure of CIP molecule [254] .

 Chapter  4 However, it can be easily recognized  in Figure 4.23.a that the distinctive bands of CIP 
identically appeared in the FTIR spectrum of the reacted (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles at 
different initial pH. This  evidence  the successful adsorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles . The main functional groups in CIP molecule, such as carboxylic , COO ⁻, 
ketone, and piperaziny l groups, are located within a wavenumber between 1200 and 1800 
cm-1 [254] . Hence , Figure 4.23.b displays  the same FTIR spectrums as Figure 4.23.a but 
with a narrow range of wavenumber (1000 cm-1-1800 cm-1) to discuss the contribution of 
the main functional groups of CIP in the adsorption of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . 
The abs orption peak of -COOH group  (νC=Ocarboxyl ) at 1709 cm-1 disappeared from the 
FTIR spectrum of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles due to the deprotonation of the carboxylic  
group at pH > pKa1 as well as the surface complexation between the carboxylic  group and 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles (Figure 4.23.b) [212] . Moreover , COO ⁻ group has two 
distinctive  bands: asymmetric band (νCOOas ) at 1580 cm-1 and symmetric  band ( νCOOs) at 
1380 cm-1. The difference between these two bands ( Δνaqueous  = νCOOas  − νCOOs) in the 
FTIR spectrum of CIP in the aqueous solution is 200. However, the adsorption of CIP by 
an adsorbent will alert the value of Δνaqueous  by changin g the distance between νCOOas  and 
νCOOs [255] . The value of Δνadsorption  after CIP adsorption can help to predict  the natu re of 
the surface complexation between the carboxylic group and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles. 
In detail, if Δνadsorption  > Δνaqueous , monodentate surface complexation is expected where 
the carboxylic group tends to form a bond with a metal center via a sing le oxygen atom. 
In contrast , if Δνadsorption  < Δνaqueous , mononuclear complexation is suggested where the 
carboxylic group connects to the metal center through two oxygen atoms. On the other 
hand , bridging or binuclear  bidentate  complexation with the carboxylic group through 
two metal centers is predicted to occur if Δνadsorption  is comparable to Δνaqueous . Figure 
4.23.b demonstrates  that the Δνadsorption  (1558 -1340) is approximately 218 , which is very 
close to Δνaqueous . Therefore , it is expected that the carboxylic group will form binuclear  
bidentate  or bridging complexation with (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles. The band of the  
ketone group around 1628 cm-1 was barely identified in the FTIR spectrum of the reacted 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles after the adsorption of 100 mg L-1 of CIP (Figure 4.23.b). 
However, Figure 4.23.b illustrated  that the peak of the ketone group, at 1628 cm-1, after 
the adsorption of 400 mg L-1 of CIP was split into two adjacent peaks at 1616 cm-1 and 
1632 cm-1, which confirms the involvement of the ketone group in the adsorption of CIP 
by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles [255] . The band of the piperazinyl group  at 1389 cm-1 was 
slightly shifted to lower wavenumber (i.e., 1375 cm-1) after the adsorption of 100, 200,  
 114 
 Chapter  4 and 400 mg L-1 as demonstrated in Figure 4.23.b and Figure  4.24.b [212] . It see ms that 
the addition of a low concentration of oxalate boosted and strengthened the surface 
complexation between Fe0 nanoparticles and the main functional groups of CIP instead 
of promoting the oxidation of CIP by increasing the generation of ROS.

reaction  parameters  were as follows : [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3 mM, pH = 7, temperature = 25 ℃, stirring

 Chapter  4 4.12.  Influence  of water matrix  
The impact  of water components such as ionic strength (IS), natural organic matters 
(NOM), and coexisting ions on the elimina tion of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was 
elucidate d in this section to assure  the applicability of utilizing (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles 
in field -scale applications.  
4.12.1.  Effect of ionic strength of the polluted water   
Industrial and pharmaceutical wastewater are complex and usually contain high 
concentrations of salts , which could hinder the removal of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles  [170] . Thus , the influence  of the ionic strength (IS) of the polluted  solution 
on the performance of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles was investigated by increasing  the 
concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) from 2.5 to 100 mM , as shown  in  Table 2.4. 
Figure 4.25 indicate s that the removal efficiency of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparti cles 
trivially deteriorated  from 95.43% to 92.76% due to the increase of IS from 0 to 50 mM. 
However , the effect of IS on the performance of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  was more 
sever e when the concentrations of NaCl were increased  to 100 mM as the removal 
efficiency of CIP diminished  by approximately 10% (Figure 4.25). At the beginning of 
the reaction (i.e., 0 -20 min), the pres ence of 100 mM of NaCl moderately affected the 
removal of CIP , as displayed  in Figure 4.25.  
 
Figure 4.25 : Influence  of the ionic strength on the competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . Reaction  parameters  
were  as follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3 mM, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, pH = 7, temperature  = 25 ⁰C, stirring  
speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.  
 
 116 
 Chapter  4 However, eventually, the excessive concentrations of NaCl competed with CIP on the 
adsorption sites of Fe0 nanoparticles, occupied some of them , and expelled the molecules 
of CIP from the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles [173] . Consequently, significant desorption 
of CIP after 20 min of starting the reaction was observed in Figure 4.25, and the final 
removal efficiency of CIP declined to  85.23%  (Figure 4.25).  It can b e predicted from 
Figure 4.25 that the electrostatic attraction might not be the main adsorption mechanism 
since the ionic strength of the solution had  limited influence on the performance  of 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles to remove  CIP from industrial and pharmaceutical wastewater 
[42]. 
4.12.2.  Effect of natural organic matters   
Besides the inorganic salts, the industrial and pharmaceutical wastewater a nd the natural 
water include natural organic matters such as humic acid, fulvic acid , and so on . [171] . 
Humic acid, as a representative of natural organic ma tter, has serval functional groups, 
for instance, phenolic , carboxyl , and hydroxyl  groups [256] . These groups can interact  
with Fe0 nanoparticles and obstruct the removal of CIP from water by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles [172] . Hence, humic acid was added with different concentrations (e.g., 5, 
10, 20, and 40 mg L-1) as demonstrated  in Table 2.4 to assess  its effect  on the elimination 
of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles .  
Figure 4.26 deduce d that the presence of humic acid in CIP-polluted  water  didn’t 
adversely  impact  the removal of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . In other words, 
humic didn’t compete with CIP on the reactive sites of (Fe0/oxalate)  nanoparticles, so th e 
removal efficiency of CIP barely decreased from 95.43% to 94.42% after adding  40 mg 
L-1 of humic acid (Figure 4.26). Therefore, these results confirm the remarkable and 
promising capabilities of (Fe0/oxalate)  nanoparticles  in treating  actual CIP -polluted  
waters. Likewise, Ji et al.  noted that th e presence of 10 mg L-1 of humic acid didn’t affect 
the adsorption of CIP by titanate nanotubes [172] . On the other hand, Luo et al.  reported 
that the presence of humic acid inhibited the adsorption of CIP by sludge -derived biochar  
[257] . 
  
 117 
 Chapter  4  
Figure 4.26 Influence  of humic acid on the competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . Reaction  parameters  were  as 
follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3 mM, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, pH = 7, temperature  = 25 ⁰C, stirring  speed = 500 
rpm, and reaction  time = 30 min.  
4.12.3.  Effect of coexisting ions   
The complex pharmaceutical and industrial wastewater don’t only include NaCl as a 
foreign ion, but they also contain many coexisting ions. Hence , it is important  to 
understand the influence  of coexisting ions , for example , potassium (K⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺), 
magnesium (Mg²⁺), carbonate (CO₃²⁻), sulfate (SO₄²⁻), and  nitrate (NO₃⁻) on the 
elimination  of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) to accurately design a treatment unit based on 
(Fe0/oxalate) that could be used as a tool to mitigate CIP contamination in water. Each 
ion's concentration was modified according to  its inhibitory strength , as shown  in Table 
2.4. Figure 4.27.a illustrates  that the presence  of K⁺ with concentrations rang ing from 0 
to 50 mM slightly decreased  the removal efficiency of CIP by 3.61%. On the other hand , 
Figure 4.27.c, Figure 4.27.e point s out that the inhibitory effect of the divalent cations, 
namely Ca ²⁺ and Mg ²⁺ was more robust  than the inhibitory effect of K⁺. I n detail, 
increasing the concentration of Ca ²⁺ from 0 to 30 mM diminished  the removal efficiency 
of CIP by 38.12% (Figure 4.27.c), while rising Mg ²⁺ concentration from 0 to 10 mM 
significantly deteriorated the removal efficiency of CIP by 57.54% (Figure 4.27.e).  If 10 
mM concentration was selecte d to make a comparison, the negative influence  of cations 
on the removal of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles could be ranked as follows: K ⁺ < 
 
 118 
 Chapter  4 Ca²⁺ < Mg²⁺ . The divalent cations, with higher valance number s, tend to interact with the 
surface of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  stronger than the monovalent cations by occupying 
more reactive sites [39,255] . 
 
Figure 4.27 Influence  of coexisting ions on the competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles . (a) Potassium, (b) 
carbonate, (c) calcium, (d) sulfate, (e) magnesium, and (f) nitrate. Reaction  parameters  are as follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-
1, [oxalate] = 0.3 mM, [CIP] = 100 mg L-1, pH = 7, temperature  = 25 ⁰C, stirring  speed = 500 rpm, and reaction  time 
= 30 min.  
 
 119 
 Chapter  4 Consequently , the divalent cations will robustly  compete with CIP on the adsorption 
locations of (Fe0/oxalate)  nanoparticles, promote the desorption of CIP as exhibited  in 
Figure 4.27.c and Figure 4.27.e, and significantly decrease CIP removal by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles . These results are consistent  with the results  of  Li et al.  [258]  and Zheng et 
al. [42]. 
Figure 4.27.b demonstrates  that the effectiveness  of (Fe0/oxalate) was negatively affected  
by increasing CO₃²⁻  concentration from 0 to 10 mM because the removal efficiency 
dropped  from 95.43% to 80.41%. Whilst Figure 4.27.d and Figure 4.27.f displays  that the 
negative effect of 10 mM of SO₄²⁻  and NO₃⁻ on the removal efficiency of CIP was more 
severe  than CO₃²⁻  as the competence  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles deteriorated from 
95.43% to 75.60% and 58.81%, respectively. Similar to cations, based on the effect of the 
presence of 10 mM of anions, their negative effect  can be ranked as follows: CO₃²⁻  < 
SO₄²⁻  < NO₃⁻ (Figure 4.27.b, Figure 4.27.d, and Figure 4.27.f). Both CO₃²⁻  and SO₄²⁻  can 
compete with CIP on the adsorption s ites by creating complexes with the iron oxides on 
the surface of Fe0 nanoparticles [259] . Yang et al.  also indicated  that the exitance of SO₄²⁻  
restrained the removal of metronidazole  by PAA/PVDF –NZVI hybrids  [259–261]. On 
the other hand, it is well documented in the literature that the presence of NO₃⁻ will force 
the core of Fe0 nanoparticles to release electrons to reduce it to nitrite, ammonia, and N 2 
[149,262] . Thus, donating  electrons from the core of Fe0 nanoparticles will weaken the 
adsorption capacity of Fe0 nanoparticles and desorb the molecules of CIP to the aqueous 
solution , as exhibited in Figure 4.27.f.  
Overall, based on Figure 4.27, the inhibitory effect of coexisting ions on the elimination  
of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  can be ordered as follows: Mg²⁺  > NO₃⁻ > SO₄²⁻  > 
Ca²⁺ > CO₃²⁻  > K⁺. 
4.13.  Regeneration and recycling of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles were regenerated and reutilized  for four adsorption processes  
to investigate  the recyclability of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles. According to Figure 4.28, 
the removal efficiency of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles slightly decreased from 
95.17% to 83.59% after the first cycle . Afterwards, the performance  of (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles sharply deteriorated as the number of cycles increased. At the end of the 
fourth cycle, the removal efficiency of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles remarkably 
declined from 83.59% to 5.66%. The massiv e loss in the efficiency of (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles  during the recycling process was due to the considerable drop in the mass  
 120 
 Chapter  4 of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles after each adsorption cycle , as well as the excessive 
corrosion of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles during  the successive treatment processes.

4.14.  Cost analysis of the treatment process by Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate)  
A cost analysis for remediating  CIP-polluted  water  by Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles 
was conducted  to reflect the economic benefits of adding oxalate to Fe0 nanoparticles in  
wastewater treatment. The cost analysis was performed  based on the cost of the synthesis 
materials of Fe0 nanoparticles , such as ferric chloride (FeCl 3) and sodium borohydride 
(NaBH 4), and the cost of the added sodium oxalate. While the cost of other parameters, 
for instance, electricity, water, etc. , was considered as a constant. Table 4.9 summarizes  
the analysis of the treatment cost.

 121 
 Chapter  4 As stated  in section 2.2, 5 g of FeCl 3 and 2.2 g of NaBH 4 are required to synthesize 1 g 
of Fe0 nanoparticles. Therefore, according to Table 4.9, the cost of producing 1 g of Fe0 
nanoparticles can be estimated to be ¥93.88 [(5×5.4) + (2.2×30.4)]. If it is decided to treat 
1 L of 100 mg L-1 of CIP -polluted  water , 0.7 and 0.3 g L-1 of Fe0 nanoparticles were  
needed for the treatment process by Fe0 and (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles , respectively, as 
illustrated  in Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8. Furthermore , Figure 4.8 proved that the optimum 
concentration of oxalate is 0.3 mM (40 mg L-1). It is evident from Table 4.9 that the 
addition of oxalate to Fe0 remarkably reduced the treatment cost of 1 L of 100 mg L-1 
from ¥65.716 [0.7×93.88] to ¥29.124 [(0.3×93.88) + (40×24/1000)]. Moreover , the 
addition of oxalate to Fe0 significantly lowered the volume of the generated sludge after 
the treatment process by nearly 57% due to the reduction of Fe0 dosage from 0.7 to 0.3 g 
L-1.  Hence , the addition of oxalate to Fe0 nanoparticles is an efficient, economic al, and 
environmenta lly friendly approach for exceptional adsorption of CIP from water.  
4.15.  Comparison between the efficacy  of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles and 
previous ly reported  Fe0-based nanomaterials  
Many  approaches were previously employed  to enhance  the competence  of Fe0 
nanoparticles in removing CIP from water , such as doping noble metals [i.e., copper (Cu), 
nickel (Ni), etc.] [125] , addition of oxidants [e.g., hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), persulfate, 
etc.] [119] , dispersion of Fe0 nanoparticles on supporting materials (i.e., biochar, wheat 
straw, etc.) [116] , solidification of Fe0 nanoparticles [120] , stabilization of Fe0 
nanoparticles (e.g., surfactants, polymers, etc.) [106] , application of weak magnetic field 
(WMF) [124] , etc. On the contrary , the removal of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles is 
reported fo r the first time in the literature ; thus, a comparison between (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles and other reported Fe0-based treatment systems was made to highlight the 
effectiveness, simplicity, and applicability of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  over the other 
reported Fe0-based treatment systems. Table 4.10 shows  that the efficiency of 
(Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles is better than most of the reported Fe0-based nanomaterials or 
systems . For example, the maximum removal capacity of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  
(294.66  mg g-1) is approximately 3 times higher than that of w heat straw -supported 
nanoscale zero -valent iron (WS -nZVI)  (104.693  mg g-1) [116] . In addition to the 
extraordinary performance, Table 4.10 demonstrates that (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles  is 
simple, environmentally friendly, inexpensive, and more applicable than most of the  
 122 
 Chapter  4 proposed Fe0-based system as it doesn’t require complex sy nthesis procedures, addition 
of toxic substances (e.g., H 2O2, persulfate, etc.) or an external magnetic field.

 Chapter  5 5.1. Major findings  and conclusions  
Ciprofloxacin  (CIP)  is a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC) . Its persisting detection 
and other antibiotics in various aquatic environments is a global threat and causes  chronic  
and lethal diseases  to humans  and animals , in addition to adversely affect ing multiple  
ecosystems in the environment. This research has proposed  an environmentally friendly, 
efficient,  and innovative treatment technology based on nanotechnology to combat the 
ubiquitous  occurrence of ciprofloxacin in our limited water resources.  
The present research has adopted iron nanoparticles (Fe0) as a reacti ve and base 
nanomaterial to develop novel iron -based nanomaterials ; namely , Mg(OH) 2-encapsulated 
iron nanoparticles (Mg/Fe0) and oxalate -modified iron nanoparticles (Fe0/oxalate), for 
superior and remarkable removal of ciprofloxacin from polluted waters.  Accordingly, t he 
doctoral  research work was divided into two major research projects : (I) remediation of 
ciprofloxacin -polluted water by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles and (II) effective removal of 
ciprofloxacin from polluted water by (Fe0/oxalate ) nanoparticles. This section will 
summarize  each research project's outcomes and conclusion s separately.  
 The key findings and conclusions of the first research project are as follows:  
1. The characterization techniques, e.g. , TEM and XRD, proved that the external 
morphology and crystalline structure  of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles didn’t  change after 
the encapsulation by a shell of  Mg(OH) 2, compared with Fe0 nanoparticles , except 
the presence of a  shell of Mg(OH) 2 surrounding Fe0 nanoparticles and the 
emergence of small peaks for brucite  in the XRD patterns of Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles.  
2. Encapsulation of iron nanoparticles by  Mg(OH) 2 layer with a [ Mg(OH) 2/Fe0] 
mass ratio of 5 % remarkably enhanced the elimination rate of CIP from 41.76% 
to 96.31% . 
3. The optimization of the treatment conditions demonstrated that 100 mg L-1 of CIP 
can be optimally remediated with more than 90% removal efficiency by 0.5 g L-1 
over a broad range  of initial pH (i.e., 3 -11) at 25 ℃.   
 125 
 Chapter  5 4. The kinetics analysis for eliminating  CIP by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles showed that 
the adsorption data was well represented by  both Pseudo first -order and Pseudo -
second -order models .  
5. The isotherm analysis declared that Freundlich isotherm model  was the best 
isotherm model to describe the equilibrium data of CIP adsorption by Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles.  
6. The thermodynamic modeling  concludes that the adsorption of CIP by  Mg/Fe0 
nanoparticles from polluted waters  was exothermic, spont aneous,  and governed 
by chemisorption . 
7. Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles w ere regenerated and reutilized for five treatment processes  
with removal efficiencies higher than 95%.  
8. The prototype lab -scale treatment system succe ssfully treated  10 liters  of 100 mg 
L-1 of CIP-polluted  water with 100% overall removal efficiency.  
9. The longevity experiment manifest ed that the coating process extended  and 
preserved  the excellent effectiveness of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles  for 30 days . 
However , storing Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles in ethanol is recommended to preserve 
them for more than a month .  
The key findings and conclusions of the second  research project are as follows:  
1. The preliminary experiments elucidate d that the remediation of CIP -polluted 
water by Fe0 nanoparticles was greatly  improved from 45.05% to nearly 95.74% 
after adding  low concentrations of the organic ligand oxalate  (0.3 mM) to Fe0 
nanoparticles .  
2. The optimization process of the treatment condi tions revealed that the optimal 
treatment parameters of 100 mg L-1 of CIP -polluted water  by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles  were as follows: [Fe0] = 0.3 g L-1, [oxalate] = 0.3 mM, initial pH = 
7, and reaction temperature = 25 ℃.   
 126 
 Chapter  5 3. The d esorption experiments confirmed that the oxidation of CIP by (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles didn’t occur. Conversely, physical and chemical adsorption were 
cooperatively responsible for eliminating  CIP from aqueous solutions.  
4. SEM -EDS, XRD, and FTIR analysis for (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparti cles before and 
after the reaction with CIP indicated that the addition of 0.3 mM of oxalate 
boosted  the oxidation of 0.3 g L-1 of Fe0 nanoparticles to needle -shape d particles 
of iron oxides and strengthened  the surface complexation between Fe0 and the 
major functional groups of CIP; namely, carboxylic  (i.e., bridging complexation) , 
ketone, and piperazinyl groups  (i.e., electrostatic attraction).   
5. The outcomes of k inetics, isotherm, and thermodynamic analysis  suggest  that the 
multilayer adsorption of CIP on the heterogen eous surface of (Fe0/oxalate) 
nanoparticles  was favorable, exothermic, and spontaneous.  
6. The effectiveness of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles to remediate 100 mg L-1 of CIP 
slightly deteriorated fr om 95.43% to 85.23% as a result of increasing the ionic 
strength of the background solution from 0 to 100 mM.  
7. The effect  of humic acid on the competence of (Fe0/oxalate) nanoparticles to treat 
CIP-polluted water was minimal as the removal efficiency sligh tly dropped from 
95.43% to 95.42% due to the increase of humic acid concentrations from 0 to 40 
mg L-1 in the background solution.  
8. The inhibitory effect of coexisting ions on the treatment of CIP -polluted water by 
(Fe0 oxalate) nanoparticles was observed i n the following order: Mg²⁺ > NO₃⁻ > 
SO₄²⁻ > Ca²⁺ > CO₃²⁻ > K⁺.  
9. The oxalate addition is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method to 
improve  the performance  of Fe0 nanoparticles  towards CIP , as the cost of 
remediating  1 liter of 100 mg L-1 of CIP -polluted water  notably declined  from 
¥65.716 (Fe0 alone) to ¥29.124 (Fe0/oxalate) and the volume of the generated 
sludge considerably  decreased  by 57% .  
 127 
 Chapter  5 5.2. Recommendations  
Based on the aforementioned major findings, the following are rec ommendations and 
suggestion s for prospective researchers : 
• The synthesis cost of Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles is still higher than that of Fe0 
nanoparticles due to the use of ethanol as a dispersion solution. Therefore, it is 
recommended to investigate the possibil ity of substituting ethanol with deionized 
water throughout the synthesis procedures to decrease the treatment cost of CIP -
polluted water  by Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles .  
• The proposed lab-scale  treatment system succe ssfully treated  continuous streams of 
CIP-pollu ted water with 100% overall removal efficiency . The promising 
performance  of this system  is reported for the first time in th is study , and it is vital to 
ensure the possibility of applying such as system in real contamination sites . Thus , it 
is recommended  to scale the system up and use it either as an additional  unit in 
wastewater treatment plants or as a separate treatment unit for t reating  real CIP -
polluted waters . 
• The suggested iron -nanomaterials  were employed to remove CIP alone from aqueous 
solutions . However, the real polluted  water, such as hospital wastewater, contain s a 
mixture of pharmaceuticals and other organic pollutants that might interfere with the 
treatment process. Hence, it is essential to examine the competence of these 
nanomaterials to remove CIP while being mixed with other pharmaceuticals to ensure 
the feasib ility of these nanomaterials in field -scale applications.  
• This study proved the possibility of storing Mg/Fe0 nanomaterials for 30 days with 
no signs of  deterioration in their efficiency in remediating  CIP-polluted waters. 
However, on some occasions , we m ight need to transport Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles 
overseas for commercial purposes , which  may take more than one month. Therefore, 
it is recommended to investigate the potential of storing Mg/Fe0 nanoparticles for 
longer  periods  (e.g., 6 – 12 months) . 
• In this st udy, Fe0 nanoparticles were synthesized using sodium borohydride as a 
reducing agent. However, s odium borohydride is  a toxic substance, and it can cause 
secondary pollution. Hence, it is recommended to utilize environmentally friendly 
reducing agents to pr oduce Fe0 nanoparticles for environmental applications. Some 
of the eco-friendly reducing chemicals  could be plant extracts (e.g., Rosa , etc.)  [263] , 
green tea extract s [125,264] , pomegranate peel extracts  [265,266] ,  and so forth.   
 128 
 Chapter  5 5.3. Future work 
The future research work will focus on tackling the pollution of water by another class of 
organic chemicals called p oly- and per -fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) . This s ection will 
give a brief introduction about PFAS -water pollution and the proposed innovative 
treatment technology.   
5.3.1.  Research background  
Poly- and per -fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are unique organic compounds belong to 
the perfluorinated compounds [267] . They are known for their unique organic structure 
that composes of fully or partially fluorinated carbon chains [267] . These chains (e.g., C -
F bonds) are hydrophobic and cha racterized by high bond dissociation energy (i.e., 544 
kJ mol-1) compared with carbon -hydrogen bonds (i.e., 389 kJ mol-1) [267] . In addition to 
the hydrophobic C -F chains, PFAS are decorated with amphiphilic functional groups 
[267] . Due to this distinctive structure, PFAS posses ses excellent tensioactive properties 
and remarkable  chemical and thermal stability. PFAS are broadly utilized in various 
industries such as paint prod uction, food packaging, firefighting foam, non-stick 
cookware , medicine, agriculture, and so forth (Figure 5.1) [267,268] . 
 
 
Figure 5.1 Problem statement  of PFAS  and proposed treatment technology.  
  
 
 129 
 Chapter  5 5.3.2.  Problem identification:  
With the uncontrollable use in many aspects of life and poor disposable procedures, PFAS 
are persisting and bioaccumulating in the environment [267] . Consequently, PFAS are 
frequently detected in different water bodies (e.g., groundwater, surface water, drinking 
water, etc.) across the universe  (Figure 5.1). For example, PFAS were identified in 
Europe, China, the United States, Japan, Australia, etc. [267] . Beside s the ubiquitous 
occurrence in several water systems, PFAS were also detected in vegetables (i.e., potato, 
cucumber, etc.), poultry (e.g., chicken), livestock (e.g., pig), milk products, fish, and so 
on [269] . Human exposure to PFAS through contaminated water and food has sever e 
health consequences as PFAS are suspected of causing  cancer, thyroid hormone 
disruption, development delays,  and so on [268,270] . Hence, an innovative remediation 
technology is urgently needed to treat PFAS -contaminated water to protect the public and 
provide safe d rinking  water.  
5.3.3.  Proposed treatment technology  
Nanoscale Zero -Valent Iron particles (nZVI) are one of the most promising nanomaterials 
for environmental remediation because of their potential to overcome the limitations of 
conventional treatment technologie s (Figure 5.1) [46]. They are featured by their small 
size, high surface area, high reducing potentials, nontoxicity, cost-effectiveness,  and so 
forth.  nZVI is widely applied to remove a broad range of contaminants  and pollutants  
from various types of water  (e.g., groundwater, surface water, etc.) and wastewater (e.g., 
domestic, industrial, hospital, etc.)  [102,153,262] . However, the utilization of nZVI to 
treat PFAS -contami nated water is poorly explored in the literature.  
5.3.4.  Aim of the proposed research  
By considering the advantages of nZVI and the research gaps in the previous studies, this 
research aims to employ nZVI as a base nanomaterial to fabricate novel nZVI -based 
nano materials to remove PFAS from contaminated water bodies  (Figure 5.1).  
5.3.5.  Research methodology : 
5.3.5.1.  Literature review and experimental preparation:  
An intensive literature review has been done to identify the critical research gaps, and 
additional information related to the research subject will be collected to build a solid  
 130 
 Chapter  5 scientific background. Moreover, the experimental bench, the req uired chemicals and 
instruments, and the experimental plan will be prepared for the research project at this 
stage.  
5.3.5.2.  Synthesis of nZVI -based nanomaterial  
nZVI will be synthesized in the laboratory via the chemical reduction method. Also, 
nZVI -based nanomat erials will be fabricated following the same technique. However, 
they will be modified with several improvement technologies, as illustrated in Figure 5.1, 
to overcome the defects of nZVI in water treatment, such as fast surface oxidation, particle 
aggregation, etc. [270] . Many modification methods will be employed to produce novel 
nZVI -based nanomaterials [46]: 
a) Doping Nobel metals:  deposition of Nobel metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, Ag, or Pd) on the 
surface of nZVI will remarkably enhance its rea ctivity. Thus, the first step is to 
identify the best noble metal to synthesize highly efficient bimetallic nanoparticles 
(Figure 5.1). 
b) Excellent supporting materials:  the second step is to identify the ideal 
supporting material, for instance, graphene oxide, titanium oxide nanowires, 
biochar, etc., to support the nominated  bimetallic nanoparticles and decrease the 
particle aggregation ( Figure 5.1). 
5.3.5.3.  Characterization of nZVI -based nanomaterial  
After the synthesis of nZVI and nZVI -based nanomaterials, multiple techniques will be 
used to prove the successful synthesis procedures of the nanomaterials , such as 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for morphological investigation, X -ray 
diffraction analysis (XRD) for crystallinity examinat ion, BET surface measurements, 
laser particle size analyzer, and zeta potential analyzer for measurement of point of zero 
charge of the nanomaterials.  
5.3.5.4.  Laboratory batch experiments  
The performance of the nominated nZVI -based nanomaterial in removing PFAS f rom the 
water will be evaluated via batch mood. Several batch experiments will be implemented 
under various removal conditions (e.g., nanomaterial dosage, initial pH, temperature, 
initial PFAS concentration) to define the optimal removal conditions of PFAS  by the 
proposed nZVI -based nanomaterial. Also, a regeneration and recycling protocol will be  
 131 
 Chapter  5 developed to ensure the reusability of the nanomaterials for several treatment cycles. 
Furthermore, it is vital to ensure the competence of the selected nZVI -based nanomaterial 
in field -scale applications. Hence, the nZVI -based nanomaterial will be employed to 
remediate real contaminated water and wastewater.  
5.3.6.  Research timetable  
The following table demonstrates the proposed schedule for the research activities over 
two years:  
Activity description  Period  
Literature review and experimental preparation  3 months  
Synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials  5months  
Laboratory batch experiments  6 months  
Design, construct and operate the treatment system  6 months  
Writing and publications  4 months  
5.3.7.  Expected results and impacts  
1. Synthesis and fabrication of a novel, efficient, and superior nZVI -based 
nanomaterial for e ffective removal of PFAS from water.  
2. Remarkable treatment efficiency of PFAS -contaminated water by the selected 
nZVI -based nanomaterial under optimal treatment conditions.  
3. An effective regeneration and recycling protocol to successfully reuse the nZVI -
based nanomaterial for multiple treatment cycles.  
4. The outcomes of this proposal are expected to provide a pioneered and 
environmentally friendly treatment technology for PFAS contamination which 
can be easily used at a reasonable cost to provide clean and safe  water.
