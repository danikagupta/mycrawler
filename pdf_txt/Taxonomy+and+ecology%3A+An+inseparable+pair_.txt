Some examples from thediatom genera Gyrosigma andPleurosigma arepresented to
illustrate thefollowing postulates: (l)the notion thattaxonomy isan"old-fashioned"
activity isarelict ofthepseudo-progessive Seventies; (2)faulty taxonomy results in
irreproducible pseudo-science, e.g., inunverifiable ecological conclusions; (3)ecolog-
icalstudies ondiatoms should takeaccount ofthemicro-sized biotope inwhich
diatoms liveandofthetime factor; (4)phenotypically identical populations inwide-
lydifferent habitats may constitute different "ecospecies."
Thecentral theme ofthisworkshop isthesynergy between taxonomy andecology inthestudy
ofdiatoms andtheapplication ofitsresults. Tosetthestage. Iwill trytoillustrate whatmayhap-
pen ifthissynergy isdisregarded withsomeexamples from thegenera Gyrosigma andPleurosigma—notbecause they areparticularly important inthisrespect, butasaresult of personal interest.
Call ita"travelogue" inwhichwetravel fromonetaxon toanother andfromoneissue tothenext.
Inaddition, Iwilloffersome personal comments onthefinancial, political andsocietal context in
which wehave tostudy diatoms.
TheTaxonomic Situation
Inmany countries including TheNetherlands, thesituation fordiatom taxonomy isdeplorable.
Nospecific budgets areavailable andexpertise inthepractical application ofdiatom taxonomy is
atriskofbeing destroyed bybudget cuts thatmay lead totheclosure ofentire departments.
This ispartly duetothefactthatfunding forbasic research isbecoming difficult tosecure,
because research maybeatthemercy ofleaders whothink thatScience canbeprofit-driven. But
another factor involved isthewidespread image oftaxonomy asanunimportant activity, and this
isaserious problem wemust address.
TheImage ofTaxonomy
Inthe first place, thevery nature oftaxonomy isoften unclear, even tosome diatomists.
Students think thattheshort courses they receive inidentification ofthemorecommon diatoms
constitute "taxonomy." Taxonomy, however, isthefundamental investigation oforganisms aiming
atacircumscription oftheir biological (that is.genetic) individuality.
Secondly, insome circles there isastrong aversion towhat they think is"diatom taxonomy"
because intheir pastexperience thishasresulted inlong listsofnames permitting noscientific con-
clusion whatsoever. Afloristic inventory does notequate totaxonomy and it'sthediatomists' own
fault that thisantipathy hasarisen.
Thirdly, there isthewidespread misconception thattaxonomy consists ofthedescription of
156
STERRENBURG: TAXONOMY ANDECOLOGY —ANINSEPARABLE PAIR 157
newspecies orvarieties. Therealisation thattaxonomy may instead have tostartwith theelimina-
tionofestablished butinvalid "pseudospecies" maycome asasurprise toworkers notspecialising
inthesubject.
Finally, thepractice oftaxonomy, with itscareful procedure ofliterature research, tracing
herbarium materials, determining synonyms andformal typification isdismissed as"old-fash-
ioned" bysome.Many biologists areunaware thattheonly permissible taxonomic procedure for
diatoms (asforother algal groups andhigher plants) must follow therules oftheICBN
(International Code ofBotanical Nomenclature).
Inthissituation wemust formulate convincing reasons whydiatom studies involving taxono-
myareimportant andshould besupported. Unfortunately, theprincipal character separating
humans from other animals—thePursuit ofKnowledge—isnolonger regarded as sufficient per
sebypotential funders. Therefore, ourarguments should inasense alsobe"politically correct," fit-
ting inwith thesocietal-political issues ofthemoment. Thismayseem amercenary attitude, but it
merely recognises thereality thatscience ispursued inasocietal—andthus political—context.
Taxonomy andEcology: Inseparable
Theexamples given here relate tothediatom genera Gyrosigma andPleurosigma. These
diatoms illustrate thelackoftaxonomic research very well, asevidenced bytheamazing factthat
ofthemany thousands ofdiatom illustrations published inthecourse of85years inSchmidt's Atlas
(1875-1959) notasingle oneshowed arepresentative ofthese genera!
Neglect oftaxonomy violates themost basic ruleofscience. Forhuman communication ofany
nature tomake anysense atall,theentities under discussion mustbeunambiguously defined. Ifno
proper taxonomic separation weremade between Canis lupus andCanis domesticus, onewould
conclude thatthedevelopment ofhuman society since theNeolithic hasbeen associated withan
explosive increase inthepopulation ofwolves.
Onlywhen theidentity ofanorganism hasbeenunambiguously fixed does itbecome possible
todetermine itsbiological characteristics: itsphysiology, nutritional requirements, habitat andbio-
geography. Onlywhen these areknown, theorganism canbecome asource ofinformation onthe
Earth's history. This isespecially thecase fordiatoms, whose siliceous exoskeleton isboth taxo-
nomically informative anddurable, permitting conclusions overmany millions ofyears.
Example (Fig. 1):Published studies ontheDutch Wadden have described anabundant pres-
ence ofGyrosigma spenceri (Quekett) Griffith etHenfrey. Thetype material ofthisdiatom indi-
cates afreshwater environment, however. Thiswould imply thateither theDutch Wadden Sea is
subject tomassive freshwater influx (which isnotthecase) orthatGyrosigma spenceri hasanecol-
ogyranging from freshwater tofully marine. Taxonomic studies have shown, however, that
Gyrosigma spenceri—for150years oneofthemost frequently recorded members ofthegenus—
ismerely alatername forGyrosigma acuminatum (Kiitzing) Rabenhorst, apurely freshwater
diatom. Inaddition, itbecame clear that atleast6different species with different ecologies rang-
ingfrom freshwater tobrackish andfullymarine havebeen called "Gyrosigma spenceri" orvari-
eties thereof. Theprevious studies thuspresented irreproducible results because oftaxonomic
errors (Sterrenburg 1995, 1997; Sterrenburg andUnderwood 1997).
Thetaxonomy ofGyrosigma andPleurosigma species isachallenge, buttheirecology isnot
particularly diverse. Thefreshwater species allavoid acidic, oligotrophic waters butdonotappear
topermit fineecological distinctions. Also, especially inHolland there aremajor gradients insalin-
ityfrom freshwater viabrackish tofullymarine andtheseshow thatsome Gyrosigma andafew
Pleurosigma species cantolerate awide range ofsalinity. Thegenera clearly flourish best inthe

marine littoral and ingeneral theyfavour
thepresence oforganic detritus, butfor
really sensitive ecological indicators other
diatom genera offer better candidates.
Example (Fig. 2):Themostextreme
case sofarobserved isG.wormleyi
(Sullivant) Boyer, alsoonrecord asthe
illegitimate synonym G.parkeri (Harri-
son)Elmore. Itstypematerial isdefinitely
freshwater and Ihave indeed collected it
innon-saline Dutch waters, but Ihave also
found flourishing populations inthe
marine littoral ofCameroon, for instance.
Also, Tiffany and Ihave verified that it
grows abundantly intheSalton Sea.
California, which is30% saltier than sea-
water! Morphologically, themarine and
theSalton Seapopulations arecompletely
identical tothefreshwater typespecimens
sothat identifications arrive atthesame
morphospecies. Onecould think oftwo
different explanations: (1)G.wormleyi is
veryeuryhaline bynature, anypopulation
being able togrow under widely different
conditions ofsalinity; or(2)Thepopula-
tions from highly saline waters observed
might notbegenetically compatible with
thetype.The latter might apply tothe
Salton Sea populations inparticular,
because theSalton Sea isman-made and
theresult ofanengineering mishap about
acentury ago.Thiscaused theColorado
River tobedumped intoanatural depres-
sion intheCalifornian desert andasthe
salinity ofthis artificial lake increased
over time, anoriginally "freshwater popu-
lation" from theColorado Rivermayhave
adapted anddrifted apart genetically. Onewould need toverify whether these individuals can still
cross with their parent line—ifnot.theyshould beconsidered adifferent "ecospecies."
Thisshows thatwemayneed toconsider thespecies concept from theecological aswell as
thetraditional taxonomic perspectives (seeSterrenburg 1994; Sterrenburg. Tiffany, andLange
2000).Figure 1.Specimen typical of"Gyrosigma spencerf' identifi-

Spatial andTemporal Factors
Examination oftheliterature offreshwater diatom surveys thatinclude ecological data raises
thequestion how reliable such "traditional" data really are.Typical sampling methods comprise too
STERRENBURG: TAXONOMY ANDECOLOGY —ANINSEPARABLE PAIR 159
broad ascale for microscopic, rapidly dividing organisms such asdiatoms, both spatially andtem-
porally. Scaling down could reveal much more about thetaxonomy andecology ofdiatoms.
Suppose thatphysico-chemical analysis ofawater column sample from astagnant freshwater
pool yields acertain pHandcertain values forsalinity, phosphate etc.Certainly, these values do
notdefine theecology ofthebottom-dwelling aswell astheepiphytic andplanktonic species. Such
astagnant pool—because oftheabsence ofmixing—shows aseries ofgradients intemperature,
insolation. pH,mineral concentrations andorganic compounds thatmayfavour orinhibit the
growth ofcertain species. When organic matter inthemud decays, thiswilllead tostrong local
physico-chemical gradients, which could lead tomajor changes inthediatom assemblage oververy
short distances. Formicro-organisms wewould need toscaledown properly, using microsensing
instead ofanalysing "abulkwater column sample."
Example: (Fig. 3):This small freshwater Gyrosigma matches theprotologue forG.exilis
Grunow. Ithadnever been described forTheNetherlands andtheonly locality where Ihavefound
itisa spot measuring only afewsquare meters: asandy slope wetted byatrickle offreshwater in
areclaimed areacalled theWieringermeer intheprovince ofNorth Holland. Inthistinyarea, Ihave
found that thespecies hascontinued togrow forabout 20years. Topological isolation isnot
involved, thephysico-chemical conditions appear tobethesame aseverywhere else intheareaand
although some ecological factor islikely tobeinvolved, Icanoffernoexplanation.
Forintertidal mudflats inthemarine littoral, onedoes notexpect tofindmajor local ecologi-
caldifferences over short distances asintensive mixing isinvolved, butthetime factor alsoneeds
tobeconsidered.
Example: (Fig. 4):When thissample wascollected from anintertidal mudflat onthecoast of
WestSamoa, thetemperature ofthesurface mudwasnear50°C andevaporation hadledtothe
appearance ofsaltcrusts insome places—indicating ahypersaline habitat.Afewminutes later, a
torrential monsoon rainsubmerged thesiteankle-deep incoolandonly mildly brackish water. The
diatom flora here hastoberesistant against severe osmotic shock andprobably forprotection,
Gyrosigma obliquum Grunow (like several other diatoms from such habitats) candevelop thick
mucus tubes.Anecological "snapshot" ofthehabitat may therefore beinsufficient, onemust con-
sider theecological extremes towhich thediatom maybeexposed during itslifetime (Sterrenburg
1989).
Inother words, wemayhave tolook atdiatom ecology attheproper spatial andtemporal
scales. Such anintegration ofecology andtaxonomy could certainly yield valuable datafrom the
purely scientific point ofview, but Iamnotsurewecould convince many politicians tofinance it.
TheEnvironment
Studies ontheimpact ofhuman acitivites ontheenvironment arecertainly regarded as"polit-
ically correct." Aprevious generation ofengineers andscientists wasable topursue acareer study-
ingacid rainand itseffects. Forthissubject, diatoms haveindeed contributed valuable data—pro-
vided therewasasound taxonomic basis foridentification ofspecies tolerant tolowpH.But
because electricity generation isnowmuch cleaner, acid rainasasource of money hasdried upin
thedeveloped countries.
Global warming wasanother good source ofpotential income forresearch but itmaynotbe
easy tofind strong arguments forimproved diatom taxonomy insupport ofshort-term global
warming studies—incontrast tolong-term paleoclimatology, ofcourse. Andbecause oftherecent
political dissent over theKyoto protocol, theimmediate future forglobal warming studies looks
somewhat chilly anyway incertain countries.

Water quality studies continue tobeamodest butsteady source ofincome forsome diatomists,
but itmaynotbeeasy toconvince ourpaying customers ofthenecessity offurther development
oftaxonomy here. Usually, customers want tohearsimple andunambiguous answers to their ques-
tions. Customer relations would notreceive amajor boost ifwetoldthem thatwe'dhave tospend
lotsofextra timeandmoney toanswer their question because we're notreally sureourtaxonomy
iscorrect! Scientifically, thismaybequite true, butwe'd eliminate ourselves from themarket.
Biodiversity
Thesituation becomes different, however, ifweconsider taxonomy andecology inrelation to
studies onbiodiversity. And "biodiversity" hasbecome aword evengovernment circles have
become familiar with. Itiscertainly politically correct toexpress concern about theextinction of
species duetohuman impact. Therefore, ataxonomically impeccable record ofverified distribu-
tionpatterns ishighly valuable. Thebasic shortcoming intheconcern about thelossofspecies
diversity expressed bynon-scientists isthatweshould firstknow what there isinanarea before
wecandetermine whatwearelosing—andthat isfarfrom being thecase.
Ifwetakethemarine littoral asanexample, asurvey oftheliterature willimmediately show
thatdataonthediatom species diversity ofmany areas oftheglobemayamount toasingle publi-
cation based ononeortwopoorly documented samples collected inthe19th century. This isespe-
cially truefortropical coasts, andthere thesituation isparticularly serious forthree reasons:
(1)thesemaybetheareaswhere species diversity incertain diatom genera may be,par-
ticularly high;
(2)theymaybeunder severe human-related ecological pressure—forinstance, thelarge-
scale destruction ofcoastal wetlands andmangrove forests, orpollution byindustrial
effluents orsewage;
(3)buttropical andsubtropical countries areoften precisely theareaswhere funding for
research isminimal'!
Example: (Fig. 5):The total verifiable documentation ofG.spectabile Grunow exPeragallo
consisted ofaschematic drawing ofasingle specimen andminimal diagnosis published in1891.
DeSouza-Mosimann, Fernandes, and Ihave verified that thispresumably "rare andobscure"
species, which hadnotbeen recorded forover acentury, isactually anabundant member ofthe
standing diatom cropofthecoast ofSouth Brazil toFrench Guyana (seeSterrenburg, de Souza-
Mosimann, andFernandes 2002)!
Buteven forourownbackyard, greatimprovement indiatom biodiversity data ispossible—
andnecessary before wecandraw useful conclusions.
Example: (Fig. 6):Tenyears ago,Stidolph described thisdiatom asanewspecies fromNew
Zealand. Ihadnever found itinsamples from anyother area, e.g., theIndian Ocean, Pacific,
Caribbean, Arabian Gulf orMediterranean until afewmonths agowhen Ifound large populations
intheGerman Jadebusen! This second, literally antipodal, record ofPleurosigma sterrenburgii
Stidolph constitutes thegreatest extension ofbiogeography possible, and, since then, ithasbeen
observed inlargenumbers inthatarea(Witkowski, pers.commun.; Stidolph 1993).
Toillustrate theactual species diversity inGyrosigma andPleurosigma forTheNetherlands:
theDutch flora ofVanderWerff andHulsrecorded about adozen taxaforthese genera. About half
ofthese aresynonyms orconfused entities, sothereremained onlyabout halfadozen Dutch sig-
moid diatoms whose identity wasreasonably certain. Sofar, Ihaverecorded about 60species from
these senera inthesame area—andmore continue tobefound. With aMacchiavellian lineofrea-

soning, itcould beclaimed thathuman activity does notharm Nature atallbutcaninstead lead to
aten-fold increase inspecies diversity.
Although acombination oftaxonomy andecology properly scaled inspace andtimewould be
ideal, even amoremodest effort togetaninsight intothehuge diversity ofdiatoms, with verified
dataontheirbiogeography andreliable information ontheir autecology, isnecessary andcanbe
argued tobecompatible with thecurrent societal-political trends. Itcancontribute tothechallenge
raised bytheAllSpecies Foundation (www.all-species.org) tocatalogue alltheWorld's living
beings!
