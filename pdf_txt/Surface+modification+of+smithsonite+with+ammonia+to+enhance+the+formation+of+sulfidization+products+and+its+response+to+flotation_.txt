Abstract: In this study, flotation experiments, zeta potential, XPS, AFM, SEM -EDS, and contact angle 
measurements were performed to study the influence of ammonium carbamate (CH 6N2O2) on the 
sulfidation flotation of chrysocolla. The results of the sulfidation flotation experiments showed that 
the recovery of chrysocolla increased more than 40% on the optimal condition after adding 
ammonium carbamate. In addition, the zeta potential of samples with ammonium carbamate w as 
clearly higher than ores for pH > 6, which was due to the complexation reaction between ammonium 
carbamate and copper ion on the surface of chrysocolla samples. The activity of copper adsorption has 
also been improved. Furthermore, the XPS data indicate d that the content of Cu -S compounds on the 
mineral surface has been significantly enhanced after ammonium carbamate complex sulfidation. The 
chemical analysis of the solution led to the same conclusion. The AFM results showed that ammonium 
carbamate had a  positive impact on the adsorption of minerals surface, and increased the flotation 
recovery. It can be deduced from the SEM -EDS analysis that the surface of chrysocolla better 
combined with S–, and more Cu -S components were generated on the surface, which  led to 1.04% 
increase of S atomic concentration. Finally, the contact angle measurements showed that the water 
contact angle of chrysocolla after adding ammonium carbamate could reach 90.4°, which proved that 
the sulfidation improved the floatability of t he chrysocolla sample.

1. Introduction  
Copper, as a kind of nonferrous metal, plays an important role in the national economy and industry 
(Wang et al. 2010; Tanaydin et al. 2022; Leandro  et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012). However, the 
worldwide production of copper is recently stagnating (Manuel a et al. 2022). Therefore, it is crucial to 
find new copper mineral sources, and to develop more efficient production technologies. It is known 
that sulfide ore is the main source of copper minerals. Due to the overexploitation of sulfide ore, 
copper oxide  ore has been widely used in the production to respond to the industry demand (Han et 
al. 2017). However, the flotation of copper oxide ore with xanthate collectors is difficult because of the 
hydrophilic surface. Several methods were developed to utilize copper oxide ore, such as flotation (Yu 
et al. 2021), hydrometallurgy (Clotilde Apua et al. 2021), and pyrometallurgy (Zhang et al. 2012).  
Chrysocolla, whose chemical composition is generally considered as Cu 2-xAlx(OH) 4H2-
xSi 2O5·nH 2O(x<1), is a copper sil icate mineral with high industrial value (Hope et al. 2012; Frost et al. 
2013; Bideaux et al. 1995). Its resource is second to malachite in copper oxide minerals, and its copper 
content can generally reach 35%. However, chrysocolla is usually discarded in the conventional 
flotation process. This is due to the technical difficulties in the recycling of wollastonite. More 
precisely, the structure of chrysocolla is quite complex, and it is difficult to separate it by conventional 
separation approaches. The stu dy of Raghavan and Fuerstenau (Raghavan & Fuerstenau, 1977) 
mentioned that the challenges encountered in the practical flotation of chrysocolla were attributed to 
its microporous structure, which is mainly formed by cupric hydroxide, amorphous silica, and water. 
In addition, because of its form of amorphous minerals with a complex surface structure, most of the 2 Physicochem. Probl. Miner. Process. , 59(3), 2023, 168573  
 
flotation collectors lack the selectivity for chrysocolla, and therefore it is difficult to separate it from 
gangue.  
At present, the commonly used r ecovery methods of chrys ocolla  can be divided into (1) acid 
leaching or ammonia leaching, (2) direct flotation, and (3) modified flotation.  
Acid leaching has good recovery effect on chrysocolla. However, the acid can react with impurities 
in gangue minerals because of its poor selectivity, which will result in increasing the need of acid 
(Banza et al. 2003). Ammonia leaching usually requires high -temperature treatment, which consumes 
lot of energy, and the recovery process is slow (Habashi et al. 197 3). The collector used in direct 
flotation has poor selectivity to chrysocolla, and thus it is difficult to separate it from gangue minerals. 
Therefore, modified flotation, especially the sulfide xanthate method, is considered as one of the most 
promising processes for the recovery of chrysocolla (Alpan et al. 1984; Guo et al. 2021).  
However, the adsorption capacity of sulfide on the surface of chrysocolla is low because of its 
complex surface structure, which results in the difficulty of normal sulfidatio n flotation of chrysocolla 
(Raghavan et al. 1984). Heating was proved to be efficient for solving this problem. However, an 
excessive energy consumption decreases the feasibility in industrial production (Parks et al. 1966). In 
this condition, the modifica tion on the surface of chrysocolla to generate a stable copper sulfide film is 
thought to be crucial for sulfidation flotation. A study on the ammonia modification of the surface of 
minerals has been conducted (Wu et al. 2017; Dong et al. 2021).  
Shen et al . studied the application mechanism of ammonium phosphate in the sulfidation flotation 
of chrysocolla (Shen et al. 2020). The obtained results showed that ammonium phosphate has a certain 
activation effect on the flotation of chrysocolla. It can also be de duced from the obtained results that 
chrysocolla changed from a non -floating state to an easily floating state when the concentration of 
ammonium phosphate is appropriate, while an excess concentration of ammonium phosphate has a 
negative impact on the sul fidation flotation of chrysocolla. The reaction mechanism of ammonium 
phosphate in the sulfidation flotation of chrysocolla may takes a part in the liquid -solid chemical 
reaction between the Na 2S solution and chrysocolla. This produces the stable adsorptio n of crystalline 
copper sulfide on the surface of chrysocolla, and improves the flotation behavior.  
This study aims at investigating the use of CH 6N2O2 as a corrosion activator in the flotation 
separation of chrysocolla and quartz by sulfidation -xanthate flotation through micro flotation. In 
addition, the CH 6N2O2 corrosion activation of chrysocolla was studied by atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) and X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in order to investigate the mechanism of 
CH 6N2O2 in sulfidation flotati on. 
2. Materials and methods  
2.1. Materials and reagents  
The samples used in the experiments were from Yunnan Province, China. Gangue minerals in ores 
were removed by artificial crushing to obtain a relatively pure chrysocolla sample. The next procedure 
consists in grinding the massive chrysocolla using an agate  three -head grinder. The ground 
chrysocolla powder samples were screened with a standard sieve to obtain powder samples with 
different particle sizes. The chrysocolla powder having a particle size in the range of ( –74 μm +47 μm) 
was considered as the sampl e for the flotation experiment. The XRD analysis results of the chrysocolla 
sample are shown in Fig. 1. The chemical composition analysis is presented in Table 1. The contents of 
Cu, Al 2O3, CaO, and Fe in the chrysocolla were determined by EDTA titration, while the content of Si 
(calculated by SiO 2) was determined using the potassium fluosilicate volumetric method .

Content (%)  34.25  33.38  1.35 0.41 0.50 
2.2. Microflotation tests  
The flotation experiments used an XFG flotation machine with a flotation cell volume of 50 ml. A 2 g 
chrysocolla sample having a particle size in the range of (−74 μm + 47 μm) was weighed and added to 3 Physicochem. Probl. Miner. Process. , 59(3), 2023, 168573  
 
the flotation cell, then continuous stirring was perfor med for 1 min. A CH 6N2O2 solution with 
different concentrations was first added to the pulp, and reacted for 5 min. The freshly prepared 
Na 2S·9H 2O solution and  Sodium isoamyl Xanth ate (NaIX)  solution were then sequentially added for 
sulfidation and flotati on of the chrysocolla sample, and both were for 5 min. These flotation 
experiments were conducted with natural pH, in order to study the effect of CH 6N2O2 in the 
sulfidation flotation of chrysocolla. The concentrate and tailings were filtered, dried, and weighed 
after each experiment. Finally, the recovery was calculated using the data .

2.3. Zeta potential measurements  
The Zeta potential of the samples was measu red, before and after the experiments, using a potential 
analyzer. Before the measurement of the Zeta potential, the chrysocolla sample was ground to finer 
than 5 μm. The  electrolyte  solution  was a KCl solution having a concentration of 3×10−3 mol/L. The 
Zeta potential measurements used 50.0 mg of chrysocolla sample, 50 ml of deionized water and 
reagents having similar concentration to those in the flotation experiments. NaOH and H 2SO 4 were 
then used to adjust the pH of the solution. Afterwards, flotation regents were added in the above 
order while magnetically stirring at 500 r/min. Finally, the pulp was stood for 5 min, and the 
supernatant was extracted and placed into a Malvin electr ode to measure the Zeta potential . 
2.4. XPS measurements  
X-ray photoelectron spectrometry was used for the surface analysis of chrysocolla after sulfidation. 
The sample was produced by chrysocolla powder . The order of adding reagents was consistent with 
that of  the flotation experiments. After filtration, the mineral samples were dried in a vacuum at 40°C 
and then sealed. XPS was performed as quickly as possible to prevent the oxidation of the sample. 
Using Mg -Kα X -ray excitation, the X -ray source power was 200 W, the background vacuum was 
greater than 10−7 Pa, and the energy scale was corrected to the binding energy of contaminant carbon 
C 1s at 248.8 eV. The XPS data were analyzed using the MultiPak software. The analysis includes peak 
fitting and semi -quantita tive analysis.  
2.5. AFM measurements  
AFM was used to obtain the two -dimensional geometric morphology and three -dimensional height 
morphology of chrysocolla under various conditions. A Bruker Dimension Icon, having a mineral 
scanning range of 5 μm × 5 μm, was us ed. The samples were prepared using chrysocolla powder, 
which was dispersed in water until the mixture became transparent, and the order of the added 
reagents was consistent with that of the flotation experiments. Afterwards, it was dropped onto a 
clean mi ca sheet, then dried and tested.  
4 Physicochem. Probl. Miner. Process. , 59(3), 2023, 168573  
 
2.6. SEM -EDS measurements  
The surface morphology and energy spectrum of the chrysocolla samples were tested under different 
conditions. The Tescan MIRA4 instrument was used. A small amount of chrysocolla sample powder 
was remove d and adhered to a conductive adhesive, and excess powder was blown away from the 
sample table using an ear washing ball. The sample was placed in a gold -spraying instrument and 
plated with gold, then placed in the SEM. The SEM analysis was performed under  an accelerating 
voltage of 15 keV, a beam current of 100 pA, a working distance of 15 mm, and under vacuum.  
2.7. Contact angle measurements  
In this study, the JY -82 contact angle goniometer was used to measure the water contact angle (WCA) 
of the chrysocolla sample before and after flotation. The specific testing procedure is as follows. The 
pure chrysocolla sample was first ground into a thin  slice to achieve a high degree of flatness on one 
side. The ground slice of chrysocolla was then placed in a beaker with 40 mL of deionized water. The 
pH was adjusted to 9, and the dosages of NaIX, Na 2S·9H 2O, and ammonium carbamate were set to 
1.5×10−3 mol/L, 1.5×10−3 mol/L, and 8×10−3 mol/L, respectively. The flotation reagents were added 
and stirred according to the flotation agent system and process. After the chrysocolla slices were 
naturally air -dried, the contact angle test was performed.  
3. Results and  discussion  
3.1. Microflotation studies  
Fig. 2 shows the curves of the flotation experiments with different concentrations of reagents, in which 
the flotation recovery is the ordinate while the NaIX concentration of the solution is the abscissa. The 
conditions of the curves were Na 2S·9H 2O (1.5×10−3 mol/L) and CH 6N2O2 (8×10−3 mol/L ) + Na 2S·9H 2O 
(1.5×10−3 mol/L).  
In the flotation experiments which used Na 2S·9H 2O (5×10−4 mol/L) as the sulfid ation  agent, the 
data demonstrated that the flotation recovery of chrysocolla samples increased from 23.67% to 38.30% 
when the concentration of NaIX increased from 1×10−3 mol/L to 5 ×10−3 mol/L. When the 
concentration of Na 2S·9H 2O was 1.5×10−3 mol/L, the flotat ion recovery of chrysocolla samples 
increased from 45.70% to 80.36% with the increase of the concentration of NaIX from 1×10−3 mol/L to 
5 ×10−3 mol/L. The results showed that the recovery of chrysocolla samples has been greatly 
improvement. This may be due  to the complexation reaction between copper ion and CH 6N2O2 on the 
chrysocolla surface, which increased the activity of coper adsorption on the surface. Therefore, more 
S2– is adsorbed on the surface of chrysocolla, and more copper -sulfide components are generated .

3.2. XPS analysis   
XPS is an important surface analysis method which can detect the state of elements in the depth range 
of 2 nm. It is used to study the elemental components and their chemical valence states on solid 
surfaces (Han et al. 2020; Feng et al. 2019). The general principle of XPS analysis is as follows. X -rays 
are used to irradiate the mineral sample in the X -ray photoelectron spectrometry, causing the in ner-
shell or valence electrons of the atoms or molecules to be excited and ejected. The electrons excited by 
photons are referred to as photoelectrons, whose energy can be measured. By plotting the relative 
intensity against the kinetic energy of the photo electrons, a photoelectron energy spectrum can be 
obtained and used to determine the composition of the sample.  
In this paper, XPS analysis of chrysocolla, before and after sulfidation, was conducted to study the 
influence of the reagents on the flotation.  Fig. 3 shows the XPS full scan spectra of the chrysocolla 
samples under different conditions, in which Cu, S, O, Si, and other elements are detected. Table 2 
presents the atomic concentration on the surface of chrysocolla under various reagent conditions.  It 
can be clearly seen from Table 2 that the atomic concentration of O decreases after direct sulfidation, 
the atomic concentration of Cu slowly decreases under the same condition, the atomic concentration 
of Si almost remains unchanged, while the atomic concentration of S increases. The results showed 
that the combination of S and Cu is more difficult than the combination of S and O, which impedes the 
direct sulfidation of chrysocolla.  
Fig. 3 and Table 2 show that the atomic concentration of S on the chry socolla surface after complex 
sulfidation with CH 6N2O2 was 0.9%, while that after direct sulfidation was less than 0.1%. As for O, 
the atomic concentration after CH 6N2O2 complex sulfidation was 69.1%, while that after direct 
sulfidation was 65.2%. The atomic concentration of Cu on the chrysocolla surface after CH 6N2O2 
complex sulfidation was 6.1%, while that after direct sulfidation was 7.9%. This may be due to the 
micro -dissolution of chrysocolla surface by CH 6N2O2, which increases the sulfidation efficiency and 
the flotation recovery of chrysocolla.  
Figs. 4(a), and 5(a) show the O 1s and Cu 2p XPS spectra of chrysocolla samples. It can be deduced 
from the literature that  the O 1s peak at 530.70 eV was CuO (Firsov et al. 1982) and the peak at 532.78 
eV was SiO 2 (Venezia et al. 1995). In addition, the Cu 2p 3/2 peak at 934.79 eV was corresponding to 
CuO (Haber et al. 1978), and the peak at 936.00 eV was CuSiO 3·2H 2O (Nakai e t al. 2007). Furthermore, 
the Cu 2p 1/2 peak at 955.96 eV was also CuO (Geesey et al. 2005), and the Si 2p peak at 102.08 eV was 
(-Si-O) (Zuo et al. 2020). The peak of S 2p in the chrysocolla samples cannot be found in Fig. 7, which 
indicates that there is  no S in ores.  
The O 1s and Cu 2p XPS spectra of chrysocolla after direct sulfidation are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 
5(b). The O, Cu, and Si peaks shifted, compared with those of the pure chrysocolla, and the peak of S 
appeared, which indicates that there ar e changes on the element composition and state on the 
chrysocolla surface after direct sulfidation. The O 1s of CuO and SiO 2 species shifted to 530.23 eV and 
531.60 eV. There is still no peak of S. In addition, compared with pure chrysocolla ores, the cont ent of 
Si decreased due to the dissolution of Si on the chrysocolla surface. There are two pairs of fitted peaks 
of Cu 2p. The former peak is 934.28 eV (2p 3/2), which is considered as CuSiO 2(OH) 2 (Nakai et al. 
1978), while the latter peak at 932.60 eV (2p  3/2) is CuO, and the peak at 955.80 eV (2p 1/2) proved the 
obtained result (Folmer et al. 1980).  
Figs. 4(c), 5(c) and 6 show the O 1s, Cu 2p, and S 2p XPS spectra of chrysocolla after complexion 
sulfidation with CH 6N2O2. It can be seen that the binding e nergy of O 1s is higher than that that of 
direct sulfidation. There is a pair of fitted peaks of S 2p in Fig. 6(b) at 162.11 eV and 16061 eV, 
corresponding to CuS. Moreover, the area of S 2p is clearly larger than that of direct sulfidation in Fig. 
6(a), w hich indicates that CH 6N2O2 facilitated the sulfidation of chrysocolla. In fact, CH 6N2O2 and Cu 
on the chrysocolla surface led to a complexation reaction, which changed the distribution of elements. 
The Cu 2p was fitted to two pairs of peaks. The binding e nergy of the former peak is 935.64 eV (2p 
3/2), while those of the latter peaks are 933.15 eV (2p 3/2) and 952.30 eV (2p 1/2). They correspond to 
CuSiO 2(OH) 2 and CuSx (x=1,2) (Brion, 1980), respectively.  
 It can be deduced from the XPS analysis that the existence of CH 6N2O2 has a positive impact on 
the sulfidation flotation of chrysocolla by producing hydrophobic Cu -S compounds, which increased 
the surface sulfidation activity of chrysocolla and improved i ts sulfidation -xanthate flotation.  6 Physicochem. Probl. Miner. Process. , 59(3), 2023, 168573

3.3. Zeta potential analysis  
The relative motion of the mineral particles in the solution can be considered as an evidence reflecting 
the change of particles on the surface. It is helpful for studying the relationship between the Zeta 
7 Physicochem. Probl. Miner. Process. , 59(3), 2023, 168573  
 
potential of the mineral surfac e and its adsorption properties in the exploration of chemical processes 
and the exchange law of mineral surfaces (Tchistiakov, 2000). This can be used to evaluate the 
interactions between flotation reagents and the mineral surface. The ion concentration, type, and state 
in the pulp solution affect the Zeta potential of minerals. The Zeta potential of minerals will also 
change depending on the ion type and ion concentration in the solution.  
Fig. 7 shows the Zeta potential change before and after the additi on of reagents. It can be seen that 
the Zeta potential had little change after adding Na 2S·9H 2O for pH > 7, while that after adding 
Na 2S·9H 2O and CH 6N2O2 became higher than the pure chrysocolla samples. This may be due to the 
fact that CH 6N2O2 can result in dissolving the surface of chrysocolla particles by reacting with Cu. 
Furthermore, the complex produced in the reaction can make the adsorption more sta ble, and enhance 
the activity of Cu on the chrysocolla surface. The flotation experiments led to the same results.

3.4. AFM analysis  
The two-dimensional geometrical topography, three -dimensional height topography, and cross -
section height of AFM can indicate changes in the mineral surface height, under various flotation 
reagent conditions. Therefore, AFM is usually used to characterize the adsorption strength of reagents 
on the mineral surface.  
The height morphology of the chrysocolla surface, before and after sulfidation, was observed in 
AFM images (two -dimensional (2D) and three -dimensional (3D)), as shown in Figs. 8(a), (b), and (c). 
In the latter, sample (a) was chrysocolla + DI water, sample (b) was chrysocolla + Na 2S·9H 2O (5×10−3 
mol/L), and sample (c) was chrysocolla + CH 6N2O2 (8×10−3 mol/L) + Na 2S·9H 2O (5×10−3 mol/L). 
The treatment time for all these reagents was 30 min. The cross -sectional height plot was generated by 
the NanoScope Analysis software (Bruker AXS, GmbH). The commonly used parameters for 
characterizing the roughness, that are the surface average roughness (Ra), maximum height roughness 
(Rmax), and root mean square roughn ess (Rq), were used to reveal the variation of the morphology 
and the height of mineral surfaces with the addition of the flotation reagent.  
The cross -sectional height plot showed relatively uniform height, which indicates that the mineral 
particles were uniform and the surface was smooth, as shown in Fig. 9(b). This proved that the 
morphology image is suitable for the illustration of the sulfidation reaction strength. In addition, the 
height value of the peak ranged between –3 μm and 9 μm.  
It can be obser ved from Figs. 8( a), (b), and ( c) that the height value of the peak increased to 24.7 
μm, and the minimum height is –5 μm. Furthermore, the surface was rougher than that of pure 
minerals. It can be seen from Figs. 8( a), (b), and ( c) that the number of peak s is significantly less after 
adding CH 6N2O2, the height value of the peak illustrated in the cross -sectional height plot was clearly 
increased to 49.5 μm, and the minimum height is almost –10 μm. The surface became rougher than 
that of direct sulfidation.  This indicates that the sulfidation reaction is more active with the addition of 
CH 6N2O2. This conclusion is consistent with the flotation studies.  
3.5. SEM -EDS analysis  
Fig. 9 shows the direct sulfidation and complex sulfidation of chrysocolla SEM images. Fig. 10 shows 
the direct sulfidation and complex sulfidation of chrysocolla EDS spectra. The results showed that 
after sulfidation without CH 6N2O2 (direct sulfidation), chrysocolla mainly consisted of 10.4% C, 31.2% 
O, 26.3% Si, and 32.1% Cu. After sulfidation with the addition of CH 6N2O2 (complex sulfidation), 
chrysocolla was mainly composed of 8.7% C, 34.7% O, 22.4% Si, 1% S, and 33.2% Cu. It can be seen 
that after addi ng CH 6N2O2 during sulfidation, the S content of chrysocolla increased by 1.04%. This 
9 Physicochem. Probl. Miner. Process. , 59(3), 2023, 168573  
 
shows that after adding CH 6N2O2, the surface of chrysocolla was better combined with S2−, and 
therefore more CuS  was formed on the chrysocolla surface, which enhanced its sulfidation, and 
promoted the subsequent adsorption of xanthate on the mineral surface.

3.6. Contact angle analysis  
The wettability denotes the tendency of a phase in a multiphase fluid to spread or adhere to a solid 
surface. In flotation operations, it ma inly involves three phases: gas, solid, and liquid. The wettability 
of minerals directly affects their floatability. The contact angle is defined as the angle θ formed by the 
tangent of the gas -liquid interface at the intersection of the three phases: gas,  liquid, and solid. It can 
express the degree of wettability. If θ > 90°, the solid surface is hydrophobic, which indicates that the 
liquid is not easily wetted by the solid, and the floatability is better. Fig. 11 shows the profile images in 
contact angle  analysis, and Table 3 shows the measurement result. The angle values marked in Fig. 11 
actually are the average results of contact angle on both sides. It can be seen from Table 3 that the 
contact angle of chrysocolla surface without reagents is 62.9° , wh ich indicates a poor natural 
floatability and thus confirms the difficulty of flotation. When ammonium carbamate is added, the 
contact angle on the mineral surface increases to 90.4° , while the contact angles on the mineral surface 
while adding NaIX and Na IX + Na 2S·9H 2O are 73.9° and 84.9° , respectively. The results prove that the 
enhanced sulfidation significantly increases the hydrophobicity and floatability of the chrysocolla 
surface, which is consistent with the flotation test results.

3.7. Discussion  
After CH 6N2O2 dissolves in water, the following reaction occurs:  
CH 6N2O2 + 2H 2O ⇌ NH 4HCO 3 + NH 3· H2O                                              (1) 
The ionization equations of NH 4HCO 3 and NH 3·H2O are given by:  
NH 4HCO 3 ⇌ NH 4+ + HCO 3−                                                                                           (2)         
NH 3·H2O ⇌ NH 4+ + OH−                                                             (3)

Fig. 12 shows the influence of the pH on Cu2+ and NH 4+ species in the solution. Copper species in 
the solution include six forms: Cu2+, Cu(OH) 2(aq), Cu(OH)3–, Cu(OH) 42–, Cu(OH)+, and Cu 2(OH)3+. It 
can be seen that Cu(OH) 2(aq) is the dominant species when pH = 8 –11. In addition, there are 4 forms 
of copper ammonium complexes: Cu(NH 3)2+, Cu(NH 3)22+,Cu(NH 3)32+, and Cu(NH 3)42+. It can also be 
observed that Cu(NH 3)2+ is the dominant species for pH = 8 –11. Finally, it can be deduce d that NH 4+ 
and Cu(OH) 2 can form a stable complex through a complexation reaction. The following reaction may 
occur in an aqueous solution:  
Cu(OH) 2(aq) + iNH 3(s) ⇌ [Cu(NH 3)i]2+(i=1,2,3,4) + 2OH−                                     (4) 
The dissolution equilibrium of Na2S in the solution is given by:  
Na 2S(s) → 2Na+(aq) + S2−(aq)                                                             (5) 
It can be seen from Fig. 13 that HS− is the sulfur dominant species when the pH range is 8 –11. 
Furthermore, CuS and Cu 2S3– were produced in the solution under the same pH, and the ion 
concentration of CuS is higher than that of Cu2S3 –. The reaction of the complex with S2– is given by:  
[Cu(NH 3)i]2+(i=1,2,3,4) + HS−(aq) + OH− ⇌ CuxSy(aq) + iNH 3(aq) + H 2O                       (6) 
These reactions can explain how the CuS  complex is produced. In addition, the whole process is 
consistent with the results of the mentioned analysis. For example, the XPS analysis proves the 
existence of Cu xSy.

Fig. 14 shows the graphical abstract of the action between CH 6N2O2 and chrysocolla.  It can be seen 
in the diagram that CH 6N2O2 has a catalysis in sulfidation of chrysocolla by circulating as a 
complexing agent. The Cu –S complex produced in the reaction can form a film in the surface of 
chrysocolla, which can improve the floatability of m inerals.

4. Conclusions  
This paper studied the effect of CH 6N2O2 as a complexing agent on the sulfide flotation of chrysocolla. 
In the process of sulfidation -xanthate flotation, CH 6N2O2 reacted as a complexing agent with Cu to 
increase the activity of Cu on the chrysocolla surface. More complex CuS was produced and the  
efficiency was increased after adding Na 2S. Flotation experiments, Zeta potential, and XPS were used 
to study the impact of CH 6N2O2 as a complexing agent on the sulfide flotation of chrysocolla. It can be 
seen in the flotation studies that the recovery of  chrysocolla clearly increased 34.66% when adding 
CH 6N2O2. In the Zeta potential analysis, the Zeta potential of the chrysocolla surface after adding 
CH 6N2O2 was significantly higher than that without CH 6N2O2 for pH > 7. This may be due to the fact 
13 Physicochem. Probl. Miner. Process. , 59(3), 2023, 168573  
 
that CH 6N2O2 partially dissolved the chrysocolla surface and complexed with and stably adsorbed Cu, 
which enhanced the activity of Cu on the surface of CH 6N2O2. It can be deduced from the results of 
AFM analysis that the addition of CH 6N2O2 promoted the adsorptio n of Na 2S on the chrysocolla 
surface, which led to an increase of the peak height by 24.8 μm, compared with direct sulfidation. This 
strengthened the sulfidation effect on the surface and improved the flotation recovery. It can be 
observed from the SEM -EDS  analysis that after adding CH 6N2O2, the chrysocolla surface better 
combined with S2−, and the atomic concentration of S increased by 0.59%, thus forming more CuS 
species, which had a positive impact on sulfidation and flotation. The measurements of the co ntact 
angle indicated that the addition of ammonium carbamate improved the floatability of chrysocolla in 
sulfidation -xanthate flotation. More precisely, it led to the increase of the contact angle from 62.9°  to 
90.4° . This paper also detailed the whole reaction process of enhanced sulfidation, in which CH 6N2O2 
is considered to perform a catalytic action.
