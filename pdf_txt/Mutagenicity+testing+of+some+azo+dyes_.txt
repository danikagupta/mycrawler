Abstract 
European textile dye products were examined for available published and unpublished data. 53 dye 
products not investigated for mutagenicity up to that point were selected for testing in the bacterial 
reverse mutation assay with Salmonella typhimurium  (Ames test) . A modification of the OECD 471 
was used (only the two strains TA98 and/or TA100 with and without metabolic activation [S9-mix] 
instead of five) . About 28% (15 out of 53) of the dye samples were positive in the Ames test. 15 sam-
ples showed positive results with TA98, 2 with TA100. The Mutagenicity of 9 Ames positive textile 
dye products was further investigated in the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) (OECD 476). 67% (6 out 
of 9) induced genotoxic effects in the MLA. The induction rates (IR) were between 2.1 and 132 in the 
bacterial reverse mutation assay and in the range between 2.1 and 15.2 in the MLA. The results con-
firm previous findings that dye products are marketed which are not sufficiently tested and which 
show mutagenic effects in in vitro  tests. 
 
1. Introduction 
Several experimental investigations have shown that textiles and waste water from textile finishing 
companies (TFCs) contain mutagenic substances [1 – 5]. The systematic backtracking of the flows of 
waste water from the production plants of three textile processing companies led to the identification 
of textile dyes as a cause of the high mutagenic effects [6 – 8].  
In the European Union (EU) new chemicals must be examined for mutagenic effects for notification. 
The base-level set requires two in vitro  tests, usually a gene mutation test in bacteria and an in vitro  
mammalian cell test [9, 10]. Most textile dyes in use are so called ”existing substances“, which have 
been placed on the market before 1983. Many of them have therefore not been adequately tested until 
now. 
In 2001 a two year CRAFT project ( Cooperative Research Action for Technology, a special program 
to support small and medium sized enterprises-SMEs) (QLK4-CT-2000-70158) was started with 9 Jäger, Hafner, Schneider: Mutagenicity of different textile dye products…  page 2 
Mutation Research 561: 35-44 (2004) TFCs and 4 research partners (RTDs; Research-Technology and development) from 8 European coun-
tries. This project aimed at the identification and substitution of mutagenic dyes in these companies 
and developing a general substitution strategy.  
 
The test strategy was as follows: 
Ø Dye products used in the different textile finishing companies and their respective amounts of 
consumption per year were listed. Information on dye composition and mutagenicity data for the 
component dyes and the formulated products was requested from the dye producers. 
Ø Available mutagenicity data from literature were summarized and evaluated.  
Ø Dyes without any mutagenicity data and high priority for the participating TFCs were selected for 
testing during the project.  
Ø Ames tests with textile dye products were performed 
Ø MLA where carried out with selected Ames positive dyes.  
 
In the project dye products were tested as they are used at the TFCs. In many cases products are mix-
tures of different dyes and additional auxiliaries. In the following the results from the  tests with 53 
dye products are presented. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
Tests for reverse mutation in the bacterium S. typhimurium  (Ames test) [11] were carried out essen-
tially following OECD TG 471 [12] and Commission directive 2000/32/EC, B.13/14 [13]. In deviation 
to the above mentioned guidelines only the two S. typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100 (Dr. B. N. 
Ames, Berkeley, CA, USA.) were applied, in presence and absence of a metabolic activation system 
(S9 Moltox, Boone, NC, USA). These strains are commonly used for screening of mutagenicity be-
cause they indicate both frame shift (hisD3052 with TA98) and base pair (hisG46 with TA100) muta-
tions. They are recommended in the DIN guideline 38415-4 for the testing of waste water. Experi-
ments with unclear results were repeated in independent studies. All tests were performed with three 
plates in repetition. For the cultivation of the bacteria Nutrient Broth No. 2 (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Eng-
land) was used. Agar plates and soft agar were prepared with Bacto-Agar (Becton, Dickinson & Com-
pany, Sparks, U.S.A.) and Rat liver S9 Aroclor 1254 induced for metabolic activation was purchased 
by Moltox Inc. Boone, USA. The positive control substances (1.5 µg Nitrofluorene (NF) per plate with 
TA98 without metabolic activation, 0.5 µg Sodium azide (SA) per plate with TA100 without meta-
bolic activation, 2.0 µg 2-Aminoanthracene (2-AA) per plate with TA98 with metabolic activation and 
2.5 µg 2-AA per plate with TA100 with metabolic activation) were purchased by Sigma Chemical, St. 
Louis, U.S.A..  A sample was classified as mutagenic if it caused more than a doubling of the number 
of revertant colonies per plate in comparison to the control in at least one strain either with or without 
the metabolic activation system and/or a concentration-related increase over the range tested. Addi-
tionally the increase of the number of revertant colonies was analysed statistically using the Wilcoxon 
rank sum test according to Mann & Whitney [14]. Testing was performed with five concentrations 
between 0.5 and 5,000 µg/plate. The mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) was applied to dye stuffs which 
proved to be Ames positive. Tests using cell line L5178Y TK+/- Clone 3.7.2.C (obtained from Scher-
ing, Berlin, Germany) were performed in 96-well microtiter plates following OECD TG 476 [15] and Jäger, Hafner, Schneider: Mutagenicity of different textile dye products…  page 3 
Mutation Research 561: 35-44 (2004) Commission directive 2000/32/EC, B.17 [16]. In a first test five concentrations between 15.8 and 
5,000 µg/ml were tested. Further tests were performed with smaller concentration steps. 
A test was evaluated as valid if the cloning efficiency (CE2) was at least 10%. A sample was evalu-
ated as positive if the total mutant frequency (small and large colonies) was elevated more than about 
100 per 106 surviving cells in comparison to the control in at least one concentration and if this in-
crease was significant (one way ANOVA followed by Dunnett`s test). Small and large colonies were 
differentiated to assess whether genotoxic effects are due to chromosome or gene mutations [17 - 19].  
Samples of the dyes were provided by the participating TFCs as they are used in their companies.  
 
3. Results 
Bacterial reverse mutation assay 
53 dye products were tested in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. The highest induction rate (IR) 
detected in either strain is presented in table 1. All positive dye products, which had an IR ≥ 2 or with 
a clear dose response relationship, are marked with grey. The measured induction rates in the positive 
samples were between 2.4 and >132. The dose-related results of the positive samples are shown in 
table 2.  
 
Mouse Lymphoma Assay 
Nine Ames positive dye products were selected and tested additionally in the mouse lymphoma assay. 
In addition to 6 of the dyes discussed above, 3 dye stuffs for which positive Ames test results were 
indicated by the producing companies were chosen for testing. The IRs of samples evaluated as posi-
tive ranged between 2.2 and 15.2. The results are presented in table 3. Positive samples are marked in 
grey. Dose-response curves are presented in figure 1. 
With some samples strong toxic effects were detected. Difficulties in the evaluation of mutagenicity 
encountered in these cases are exemplified with ID 148 “Astrazon Blue BG 200% 0.1“. This dye had 
to be investigated in three separate tests. The first assay with concentrations between 5,000 and 157 
µg/ml could not be evaluated due to toxicity. In the second study, concentrations between 158 and 0.5 
µg/ml were tested. With 158 µg/ml toxicity was again 100%, with 50 µg/ml the mutant frequency 
reached eight fold of the negative control, but toxicity was still 96%. With the next lower tested con-
centration of 15.8 µg/ml the mutant frequency was only slightly increased, while toxicity was reduced 
to 14%. Therefore in the third study concentrations between 50 and 20 µg/ml were tested. With con-
centrations ≥ 30 µg/ml mutant frequencies were significantly increased and toxicity was between 40 
and 85%.  
About 28% (15 out of 53) of the dye samples were positive in the bacterial reverse mutation assay 
(strains TA98 and/or TA100). Mutagenicity of 9 Ames positive textile dye products was further inves-
tigated in the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA). 67% (6 out of 9) induced mutagenic effects in the MLA 
(table 3). Small and large colonies were differentiated. With Erionyl Bordeaux and Turquoise Ci-
bacrone no significant induction of large colonies was detectable. With Bleu Terasil, Astrazon Blue 
FGRL and Astrazon Blue BG induction of mutant frequency of large colonies was lower or in the 
same range as with small colonies. Only with Bemaplex Black mutant frequency of large colonies was 
elevated more than those of small colonies, based on the calculated induction rates.  Jäger, Hafner, Schneider: Mutagenicity of different textile dye products…  page 4

4. Discussion  
Most of the textile dyes on the market belong to the so-called “existing substances”. Mutagenicity data 
for these substances are often scarce. Several of the textile dye products tested for reverse mutations in 
S. typhimurium  and in the mouse lymphoma assay proved to be mutagenic in both assays. These tests 
fulfill the criteria for the base-level testing requirements of the EU Technical Guidance Document 
(TGD) [10]. According to the testing strategy of the EU TGD positive results in both tests would war-
rant additional testing in vivo  or reconsideration of the marketing of the compound. Project budget did 
not allow testing in the MLA for all dyes which responded in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. 
Therefore dye products, which were important for the TFCs due to the use of high volume were se-
lected.

Mutation Research 561: 35-44 (2004) The MLA makes it possible to distinguish large and small colonies. It is thought that small colonies 
are induced by chromosome damage and the large colonies by gene mutations [18, 19]. Accordingly it 
would be expected that Ames positive samples should be characterised by an induction of large colo-
nies in the MLA. However such an effect could not be detected in most samples analysed here. Com-
paring the IRs for the mutation frequencies of small colonies with those for large colonies did not re-
veal any substantial differences. Only with Bemaplex Black, mutant frequency was higher with large 
colonies than with small colonies which coincide with gene mutation effects. Erionyl Bordeaux and 
Turquoise Cibacrone showed no increased mutation frequencies with large colonies at all, so it can be 
assumed that genotoxic effects demonstrated in MLA are primarily due to chromosome mutations. 
Also the Ames positive samples which were MLA negative showed no higher mutation frequencies 
when only the large colonies were considered. In summary, no clear correlations between point muta-
tions in the bacterial reverse mutation assay and induction of large colonies in the MLA was found. 
Clements [20] already noted that colony size cannot necessarily be used to predict whether a chemical 
substance is a point mutagen or a clastogen. 
If the results obtained are taken to be representative of all dye products, then nearly 20% of untested 
textile dyes may be of concern. Within this EU project 281 textile dye products were checked for 
availability of data on mutagenic effects. Based on data from the literature, from dye producers and on 
own laboratory results altogether 14 dye products were judged to show mutagenic activity, 16 dye 
products were suspicious of being mutagenic due to positive results from one test and for 71 dye prod-
ucts no test results were available at all [21]. From the results shown here it can be assumed that 
within the 71 untested dye products about 14 would show positive results in vitro. Taken together, for 
all 281 textile dye products the percentage of possibly mutagenic dyes therefore is estimated to be 
higher than 10%. 
In the past various research groups used the Ames and other bacterial tests, as well as mammalian cell 
test systems and in vivo  assays (e.g. induction of micronuclei in bone marrow cells) to investigate pos-
sible mutagenic effects of dyes used for textile finishing [22 – 27]. Most of these investigations focus-
sed on anthraquinone and azo dyes. Comparisons with our results are difficult as we tested ready-to-
sell products, which may consist of mixtures of dyes and additionally contain auxiliaries. However the 
observations made by several investigators that a significant proportion of dyes cause mutagenic ef-
fects in various test systems is corroborated by our findings. Friedman et al. [28] and MacGregor et al. 
[29] investigated formulated textile dye products in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. Their respec-
tive findings of 32 and 29% dyes positive in S. typhimurium  are in good agreement with our results. 
These and other published data on single dye ingredients or dye products were used to evaluate other 
dye products used by textile finishing companies within this EU research project [21].  
The dyes discussed here were chosen for testing because no mutagenicity data had been published 
previously on them. As far as chemical nature of the dyes is revealed in the safety data sheets, no spe-
cific chemical group emerges as especially important. Bleu Terasil 3R-02 contains Disperse Blue 999 
(Cas-No. 1594-08-7), an anthraquinone dye, but also azo dyes. Both Astrazon Blue FGRL and Astra-
zon Blue BG comprise Basic Blue 3 (Cas-No. 73570-52-2), which is based on a phenoxazine struc-
ture. Astrazon Blue BG contains in addition another basic dye, Basic Blue 159. Bemaplex Schwarz C-
2B contains mainly Acid Black 107 (Cas-No. 12218-96-1), a metal complex dye of unknown struc-
ture. With Turquoise Cibacrone PGR the safety data sheet only states that the dye belongs to the 
phthalocyanine dyes; no indication of chemical nature is given for Erionyl Bordeaux A-5B. Olive Ci-

Mutation Research 561: 35-44 (2004) banone 2RMD and Brun Cibanone BRMD, which gave negative results in the MLA, consists of an-
thraquinone dyes, whereas Rouge Imperon K-B, which also proved to be negative in the MLA, con-
tains Pigment Red 146 (Cas.-No. 5280-68-2), an azo dye. In some cases, impurities may also be influ-
encing the test outcome. In the case of Turquoise Cibacrone PGR different results were obtained in the 
bacterial reverse mutation assay when the formulated product and the technical grade, pure dye were 
tested. These data are reported elsewhere [21]. In this situation tracing back mutagenicity to single 
components is difficult. Nevertheless the formulated products are the material which workers and pos-
sibly consumers via textiles are exposed to. 
With regard to consumers, exposure to dangerous substances may depend on the fastness of the dyes 
used. Whereas many of the textile dyes, especially those of high quality, show high fastness, at least 
some dyes may be leachable from fabrics. Knasmüller et al. [2] obtained positive results with 18 tex-
tile samples (9.2%) when they exposed S. typhimurium  directly by placing pieces of fabric on the agar 
plates and looking for reverse mutations in the so called “Ames spot test”. Within this project similar 
results were obtained. Five percent of textile samples tested showed positive responses in this test (for 
details see [30]), supporting the observations of Knasmüller et al. [2] and indicating bioavailability of 
the dyes. In response to the obtained results, the textile finishing companies participating in the EU-
project stopped the use of dyes which proved to be mutagenic in mammalian cells and substituted less 
harmful substances for them.
