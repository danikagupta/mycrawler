Annotation  
The PLFA profiling method was adopted and used to determine changes in 
microbial community structure and abundance along natural and human -
induced environmental gradients. The presented studies were based on field 
sampling campaigns combined with targeted laboratory experiments. 
According to the aims of particular studies, microbial PLFA fingerprinting was 
combined with the auxiliary below - and aboveground ecosystem 
characteristics to identify the drivers of microbial responses to environmental 
changes or w ith 13C-labelling and metagenomics to obtain more complex 
information about running processes and involved microorganisms.

2. Aims and objectives  
The foregoing literature review demonstrated that the PLFA profiling is an 
increasingly important approach to acquire information about soil microbial 
community structure (MCS), microbial response to various environmental 
changes, and utilization of 13C-labelled carbon substrates . The general aim of 
this thesis was to adopt the PLFA profiling method and fully employ its 
potential to gain ecologically relevant information about soil microbial 
communities and their functioning. Each of the presented studies focused on 
different aspect  of soil microbial ecology. The studies I  and II focused on  
determination of key environmental factors which affect microbial community 
structure and functioning in two different ecosystems: the temperate species -
rich mesotrophic meadow and the High Arctic  tundra . The objective of study 
III was to quantify  heterotrophic CO 2 fixation by soil mic robial community and 
determine  its incorporation into microbial biomass  in permafrost affected 
soils. Finally, the study IV  aimed to elucidate whether microbial community 
structure and functioning is a general driver of soil microbial community 
demand for phospho rus. The specific objectives were as follows:  
Objectives of study I – To determine the main and combined effects of 
fertilization, mowing, and dominant plant species removal on soil microbial 
and physico-chemical properties, and to link the belowground response with 
aboveground plant characteristics and document the adaptation of the whole 
grassland to a long-term management. We hypothesized that the treatments 
will affect the soil microbial properties through their effect on SOM content, 
nutrient availability and soil acidity, and that fertilization and mowing will 
affect these soil properties in opposite way. We further expected that the 
combined application of fertilization and mowing would balance the effect of 
individual treatments. 
Objectives of study II – To describe the spatial heterogeneity of abiotic and 
microbial properties in the soils along three altitudinal transects in the High 
Arctic (Billefjorden, Central Svalbard) and identify key environmental factors 
driving the altitudinal variability of the soil microbial community structure and 
activity in this Arctic ecosystem. We hypothesized that microbial biomass, the 
fungal proportion in the microbial community, and microbial activity will be 
positively related to SOM content, which will decrease along with increasing 
elevation.  
28Objectives of study III – To perform a 13CO 2-labelling experiment and 
determine the 13C enrichment of soil microbial PLFAs in different layers of 
permafrost-affected soils to provide direct evidence of microbial heterotrophic 
CO 2 fixation and subsequent C utilization. We hypothesized that the rate of 
heterotrophic CO 2 fixation increases with increasing soil depth due to lowering 
the C availability, and that the composition of microbial communities utilizing 
inorganic C differs between the different soil layers. 
Objectives of study IV – To determine the microbial PLFA composition in the 
worldwide soils with variable microbial community demand for phosphorus 
and use the microbial community structure together with other soil 
characteristics as explanatory variables to identify the main drivers of soil 
microbial community critical C- to-P ratio (C:P CR). We expected that the C:P CR 
vary among soils and generally increases in P-poor soils as a result of microbial 
community adaptation to P limitation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
293. Results and conclusions  
The unifying element of studies presented in this thesis was the determination 
of microbial community structure and functioning using the analyses of 
phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers in combination with microbial 
activity measurements. In all conducted studies, the microbial characteristics 
were related to auxiliary abiotic and biotic environmental variables and 
nutrient sources to portrait broader picture about the functioning of 
investigated soil systems. Besides the fact that PLFAs provided information 
about microbial community structure and abundance, each of these studies 
employed the PLFA fingerprints in a different way according to specific 
objectives of particular studies. The aim of this chapter is to summarize main 
findings and emphasize the various aspects of PLFA interpretation in the 
broader ecosystem context. 
 In the studies I  and II, the PLFAs represented primary data of the 
conducted research. The study I  investigated impacts of long-term 
management regime on above- and belowground compartments in the wet 
temperate grassland subjected for 16 years to fertilization, mowing, and 
dominant plant species removal. The biotic response to treatments was 
significant aboveground, where the plant productivity, plant biomass 
elemental stoichiometry and community composition significantly reflected 
fertilization and mowing. In contrast, the majority of soil microbial 
characteristics including microbial biomass, microbial C:N:P stoichiometry, 
enzyme activities and abundances of main microbial groups (detected by 
PLFAs specific for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, actinobacteria, 
and fungi) remained unaffected despite significant changes in soil physico-
chemical properties and pronounced aboveground response. However, the 
evaluation of the whole PLFA pattern by multivariate statistics revealed 
significant shifts in microbial PLFA composition in fertilized plots connected 
mainly with lower soil pH. Given the narrow overall pH range in the 
experimental plots (4.18-3.85), our results indicate that the PLFA profiling 
allow s highly sensitive detection of microbial response to minor changes in soil 
acidity. Furthermore, we observed close links between microbial and plant 
community responses to the treatments, indicated by the significant 
correlation between sample scores of main principal components extracted 
from PCA based on microbial PLFA profiles and plant community composition. 
30In summary, the PLFA profiling enabled very sensitive indication of 
management effects on microbial community composition. The combination of 
microbial PLFA fingerprints with information about plant community 
composition revealed mutual adaptation of plant and microbial communities 
to particular grassland management.  
 In the study II,  the natural gradients of soil geochemical and microbial 
properties along three altitudinal transects in the High Arctic ecosystem were 
investigated. In order to meet objectives of the study, representative soil 
samples from four different altitudes (25, 275, 525 and 765 m a.s.l.) were 
gathered along each transe ct. These climosequences ranged from tundra 
vegetation to sites characterized by bare soil and biological soil crusts. Each 
sample was characterized by an array of geochemical and microbial 
parameters, including PLFA fingerprints.  Abundances of main microb ial groups 
based on specific PLFA markers were compared to determine important shifts 
in MCS. Beside s significant horizontal variability in proportions of notional 
bacterial groups (Gram -positive and Gram- negative bacteria actinobacteria), 
the systematic a ltitudinal shift in fungi -to-bacteria ratios within microbial 
communities along all three gradients  was observed . In contrast to our 
expectations, microbial communities with highest fungal proportions occurred 
at the most elevated sites, while microbial co mmunities from lower altitudes 
were dominated by bacteria. The multivariate statistics retained the Mg2+ 
availability as the main factor driving the horizontal heterogeneity of soil MCS 
while changes in soil pH, SOM content and soil moisture were mainly 
responsible for the elevational shifts in MCS. In general, most of the changes in 
soil properties and MCS w ere directly or indirectly connected with decreasing 
coverage and occurrence of vascular plants along with increasing elevation. 
Compared to the study I  was the PLFA profiling used in the study II  to 
describe microbial biomass and community structure along  natural gradients 
of environmental conditions on a regional spatial scale.  The results help to 
describe current state and estimate the future development of the High Arctic 
ecosystems in  Svalbard.  
 Unlike the two previous rather descriptive studies, the studies III and IV 
were focused on phenomena with wider ecological implications. Study III  
investigated the significance of CO 2 fixation by heterotrophic microorganisms 
in arctic soils. Even though the occurrence of this process in soils is generally 
accepted ( Miltner et al., 2004; Šantrůčková et al., 2005), its importance for soil 
31C sequestration was unknown. Therefore, the study was conducted with the 
aim to elucidate the role of dark CO 2 fixation in arctic soils from a range of 
tundra ecosystems around the northern circumpolar region. The abundance 
and taxonomic affiliation of various carboxylase genes was determined by 
shotgun metagenomics and 13CO 2 pulse labelling was used to quantify the rate 
of inorganic C incorporation into microbial biomass. The 13C enrichment of 
microbial PLFAs provided the direct evidence of heterotrophic CO 2 fixation and 
subsequent C utilization by soil microorganisms. Moreover,  unique patterns in 
the 13C enrichment of specific PLFA markers (PLFA-SIP) within organic, 
mineral and cryoturbated horizons were observed which indicates different 
contributions of fungi and bacteria to overall CO 2 assimilation in these soil 
layers. In the context of the thesis, the study III demonstrated that multiphasic 
approach combining determination of presence and magnitude of a given 
process (13C-labelling and PLFA-SIP analysis) with the method yielding less 
direct, but more specific information about the soil potential for a certain 
function (diversity and taxonomic affiliation of carboxylase gene) enables to 
depict more complex picture about microbial processes in soil. 
 In the study IV , the PLFA fingerprints were used as predictors of half 
saturation constant (K M) of a modified Monod equation, which was employed 
to describe the effect of P availability on microbial community growth rate. 
Previous empirical studies have shown that the ratio between available C and 
N at which the microbial growth starts to be N limited (C:N critical ratio) varies 
between  ≈20 and 200 (e.g. Zechmeister-Boltenstern et al., 2015). The study IV  
was the first attempt to assess potential variability and drivers of relative 
microbial community demand for P (i.e. critical C:P ratio - C:P CR) in the soil. Our 
results have shown that the microbial C:P CR ranged between 26.5 and 465 in 18 
soil samples from various ecosystems. The high variability of C:P CR was mainly 
related to differences in K M parameter. The forward selection of the best K M 
predictors retained, among all available auxiliary data, the sample scores from 
PCA on microbial PLFA composition. Our results thus indicate that the 
microbial C:P CR is largely determined by the particular MCS of the soils. 
However, the MCS is shaped by the array of edaphic factors like pH, 
temperature, moisture, substrate and nutrient availability, and their 
combinations which indicates complex environmental control over the 
microbial community C:P CR. In summary, the study IV  represents the rather 
unusual use of microbial PLFA fingerprints. In contrast to a majority of studies, 
32where the soil PLFA profiles were used to detect microbial response to certain 
environmental change (e.g. study I  and II), the study IV  utilized the PLFA 
patterns as variables explaining the more general characteristic of microbial 
communities, the C:P CR. 
 In conclusion, this thesis presents results from four studies that employed 
the PLFA profiling as an approach to acquire information about microbial 
abundance ( I - III), microbial community structure ( I - IV), and activity ( III). 
The PLFAs were used to compare soil microbial communities on various 
spatial scales – on local ( I), regional ( II) and larger scales ( III, IV). The results 
from conducted studies confirmed that the PLFA profiling has the large 
potential to reveal differences in MCS. The sensitivity of this method was 
demonstrated mainly in the study I , where even subtle response to 
fertilization treatment was detected while other microbial characteristics 
(with exception of C and N mineralization rates) did not respond to 
pronounced changes in soil and vegetation characteristics. In the studies  I and 
II, the PLFA data were combined with numerous of auxiliary environmental 
variables, which allowed us to reveal coupling between microbial PLFA 
patterns and plant community composition ( I) and to identify abiotic and 
biotic factors shaping the MCS ( I, II). Such integrated approach allowed for the 
more complex understanding of ecosystem functioning and response to 
changes. In this context, I would like to stress the need of using multivariate 
statistical tools (PCA, redundancy analyses, variation partitioning, forward 
selection of explanatory variables) when using PLFA data either separately or 
in combination with other factors and environmental characteristics. The 
comparison of PLFA profiles among various soils highlights the main 
disadvantage of the PLFA-based approach. Despite its undisputable power to 
recognize shifts in MCS, the interpretative value of such information is limited 
due to the low taxonomic resolution (see section 1.3). The use of extended 
extraction method that yields significantly higher number of PLFAs (see 
section 1.1) than the simple extraction method used in conducted studies could 
partially compensate this deficit and enhance the sensitivity of detection of 
shifts in the MCS. However, the potential increase in the interpretative power 
in case these studies would be relatively small compared to the extra 
processing time and financial expenses needed. The study III proved the large 
potential of the combination of PLFA-SIP analysis and metagenomics. Such 
multiphasic approach can be especially valuable for the deeper understanding 
33of particular C sequestration processes. The use of certain FAs ratios as 
indicato rs of metabolic or physiological stress was not applicable in our 
studies. Despite significant differences in soil characteristics, such as soil pH 
(studies I , II), aeration, and C availability ( study III ), which were previously 
reported to trigger the stress response, no significant trends in the commonly 
used stress indicators were observed in our studies. Even when there were 
minor changes in indicator ratios observed, the se could be caused by shift in 
microbial community composition and not induced by stress (see section 1.5). 
Our findings thus underpin the evident limitations of using PLFA-based stress 
indicators in studies which aim to investigate microbial communities in soils 
along natural environmental gradients. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
344. Future prospects  
I´m currently working on a study focused on the combined effect of 
fertilization and soil water level on the partitioning of C assimilated during 
photosynthesis in the plant-microbe-soil system (Kotas et al., in preparation; 
see section 1.6). We employed here the 13CO 2-labelling of wetland plant species 
(Carex acuta) grown in controlled mesocosms and tracked the assimilated C in 
different compartments of the experimental systems including microbial 
PLFAs. Our results indicate that the treatments interacted in their effect on C 
partitioning in the system including rhizodeposition intensity and subsequent 
utilization of root-released C by fungal and bacterial biomass. 
 In the future, I would like to continue in the research of interactions 
between plants and soil environment. These interactions are mediated by the 
regular input of exudates and other rhizodeposits into the surrounding of plant 
roots , which strongly affects diversity and activity of soil microorganisms and 
results in the rhizosphere priming effect, the process largely affecting C and N 
cycling in the soil (Kuzyakov, 2010). The microbially -driven processes in the 
rhizosphere are thus directly linked with root exudation. However, it is poorly 
understood how closely root exudation corresponds with the plant 
metabolome and how it is related to plant traits and changing nutrient 
availability. Therefore, my main prospect for future work is to focus on finding 
the links between the soil nutri ent availability, plant functional traits, 
especially the root exudation intensity and composition, and microbial activity. 
To fulfil these goals, I plan to exploit my extensive experience with various 
chromatographic methods and mass  spectrometric techniq ues as well as with 
stable isotope methods and immerse myself into the field of metabolomics.

ABSTRACT
Species-rich oligotrophic meadows are affected by a
wide range of management interventions thatinﬂuence their functioning and capacity to deliverecosystem services, but long-term studies on the
above- and belowground adaptations to different
management tools are still scarce. We focused on theinteractive effects of NPK fertilization, mowing, andremoval of the initially dominant species ( Molinia
caerulea ) on plant, soil, and microbial responses in
wet oligotrophic grassland in a 16-year full-factorialmanipulative experiment. Changes in vegetationcomposition, soil pH, and nutrient availability were
accompanied by altered microbial phospholipid fatty
acid (PLFA) composition, whereas treatment effectson soil microbial biomass and carbon (C) mineral-ization were mainly related to changes in soil organicmatter (SOM) content and nutrient availability.Fertilization decreased plant species richness
aboveground and lowered SOM storage and micro-
bial activity belowground. Mowing preserved highplant diversity and led to more efﬁcient recycling ofN within the grassland, whereas Molinia removal
signiﬁcantly affected only plant community com-position. Mowing combined with fertilizationmaintained high species richness only in the shortterm. Belowground, mowing reduced N leaching
from the fertilized system but did not prevent SOM
depletion, soil acidiﬁcation, and concomitant ad-verse effects on soil microbes. We conclude thatannual mowing is the appropriate type of extensivemanagement for oligotrophic species-rich meadows,but the concomitant nutrient depletion should notbe compensated for by regular NPK fertilization dueto its adverse effects on soil quality.

55INTRODUCTION
Traditionally managed oligo- and mesotrophic
species-rich meadows are among the ecosystemsmost endangered by current land use changesthroughout Europe (Kaligaric and others 2006 ).
For economic reasons, their traditional manage-ment of mowing once or twice a year is either
intensiﬁed by fertilization and increasing mowing
frequency, leading to signiﬁcant changes in theabove- and belowground components of theecosystem (Bardgett and others 1999 ; Hedlund and
others 2003), or the management is completely
abandoned.
The two compartments of the system closely
interact via top-down effects through plant-litter
inputs (Bardgett and Shine 1999; Fornara and
others 2011 ) and rhizodeposition (Hartmann and
others 2009 ; Doornbos and others 2012), and bot-
tom-up feedback effects on plant nutrient supply
and resource partitioning via the microbial com-munity associated with roots (van der Heijden andothers 2008 ; Friesen and others 2011 ). These plant–
microbe interactions are particularly strong in
oligotrophic ecosystems (Bardgett and others 1999 ;
Paterson 2003 ; van der Heijden and others 2008 ),
while nutrient enrichment weakens the co-deter-
minacy of plants and microbes (Wei and others2013; Liu and others 2014 ). Therefore, the type of
management with its speciﬁc impacts on the above-and belowground compartments of the system ex-
erts an important inﬂuence on the functioning and
services provided by the ecosystem.
Traditional regular mowing is a convenient
management system for maintaining the species
richness of grasslands (for example, Silvertown andothers 2006 ; Galva ´nek and Leps ˇ2008 ). Long-term
hay harvesting affects nutrient availability bydecreasing soil potassium (K) and nitrogen (N)contents (Venterink and others 2009 ) and increases
C allocation belowground (Bardgett and others
1998; Kuzyakov and others 2002 ). Enhanced
belowground C inputs commonly stimulate the
biomass and activity of the soil biotic community(Guitian and Bardgett 2000 ; Uhlı ´r ˇova´and others
2005; Zhang and others 2013 ) and affects N cycling
within the ecosystem (Hamilton and Frank 2001 ;
Kasˇtovska ´and others 2014 ). Grassland fertilization
potentially has the opposite effects of mowing inmany cases. Application of mineral N and phos-
phorus (P) improves forage production and its
nutritional quality but commonly causes loss ofplant species richness (Hejcman and others 2014 ;
Lepsˇ2014 ). Direct impacts of fertilization on soil
include acidiﬁcation (Liu and others 2014 ), in-creased N (Bardgett and McAlister 1999 ),
and de-
creased base cation availability (Clark and others2007 ). These changes are usually accompanied by
reduced soil microbial biomass (Treseder 2008;
Sillen and Dieleman 2012 ) and shifts in microbial
community composition (Rousk and others 2010a ;
Zhang and others 2013; Legay and others 2016 )
including decreased fungal abundance (Bardgettand McAlister 1999 ;B a˚a˚th and Anderson 2003;
Treseder 2008 ). It has been suggested that simul-
taneous application of fertilization and mowingmay partly balance the negative effects of fertil-
ization on plant diversity in semi-natural meadows
(Leps ˇ2014 ). Whether mowing also compensates
for the negative fertilization effects belowground is,however, unknown.
Management effects on the structure and func-
tioning of species-rich wet meadows are dependenton the temporal scale (Hedlund and others 2003;
Lepsˇ2014 ). Short-term experiments might under-
estimate the response of vegetation and soil andcould thus provide erroneous conservation rec-
ommendations. Therefore, long-term studies com-
bining aboveground–belowground approach tostudy ecosystem responses to management prac-tices are desirable, but rare. To increase ourunderstanding of plant–microbe–soil linkages, weexamined a wet temperate grassland subjected for
16 years to mowing, fertilization, and dominant
plant species removal in a full-factorial design.
Changes in plant community composition in this
experiment have previously been described (Leps ˇ
1999 ,2004 ,2014). We complemented the existing
data by studying plant productivity, stoichiometry,and soil microbial and physico-chemical properties.Our aim was to document the adaptation of this
grassland to long-term management and any cou-
pling or uncoupling of above- and belowground
responses. We hypothesized that (1) fertilization
would exert the strongest inﬂuence on plant andsoil properties due to its direct effect on nutrientavailability and soil acidity; the inﬂuence of mow-ing would be less pronounced than the inﬂuence offertilization and mediated through regular biomass
removal and a concomitant decrease in nutrient
availability; dominant removal would have theweakest effect on belowground characteristics. (2)
Combined application of fertilization and mowing
would balance the effects of the individual treat-ments. Fertilization of mown plots would replenishthe nutrients withdrawn with the harvested bio-mass, while mowing would reduce the amount of
available nutrients and concomitant soil acidiﬁca-
tion compared to plots that are only fertilized. Weexpected that mown fertilized plots would haveFertilization, Mowing, and Removal of the Dominant Species 355
56intermediate nutrient availability and pH compared
to mown-only and fertilized-only plots. (3) Theresulting changes in microbial biomass, activity,and community composition in response to man-
agement would be mainly driven by the treatment
effects on SOM content, nutrient availability, andsoil acidity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Site and Sampling
The study site is a species-rich oligotrophic wetmeadow situated in south Bohemia, CzechRepublic (48 /C17657¢11 ¢¢N, 14/C176 35¢34 ¢¢E, at 510 m
a.s.l.). Mean annual temperature and precipitationare 7.8 /C176C and 620 mm, respectively (nearby
meteorological station C ˇeske´Budeˇjovice, 400 m
a.s.l.). The meadow was traditionally mown onceor twice a year until the end of the 1980s and thenmowing was re-introduced at the start of theexperiment in 1994. Before the treatments wereimposed, the plant community was highly similar
among plots and characterized as Molinion with
some elements of Violion caninae (Chytry ´ 2012 )
(dominant species Molinia caerulea with 35% cov-
er). The soil is a cambisol with pH 4.1 ±0.02, total
soil C (C
tot) and N (N tot) concentrations of 28 ±0.6
and 2.5 ±0.05 mg g-1, respectively, and a bulk
density of 1.4 ±0.05 g cm-3(mean values ±SEM
for the upper 20 cm of soil in mown, unfertilized,
and non-removal plots).
The experiment combined mowing, fertilization,
and dominant species removal in a full-factorial
design giving eight treatment combinations, eachin three replications (plots 2 m 92 m square with
central 1 m
2used for sampling (see Leps ˇ1999 ,
2004 and Table 6 in Online Appendix A for more
details). Brieﬂy, fertilization was conducted using
commercial NPK fertilizer (78 kg N ha-1y-1,
123 kg P ha-1y-1, and 123 kg K ha-1y-1) ap-
plied annually in spring. Mowing was performed
annually in late June, and the harvested biomasswas removed. Molinia individuals were manually
removed in April 1995, new individuals were re-moved annually when needed. The soil sampleswere collected in October 2010 after plant senes-
cence to eliminate the direct inﬂuence of root
exudation on the soil microbial community and toassess only permanent changes in soil characteris-tics. From each of the 24 plots, composite sampleswere prepared from four subsamples gathered witha soil corer (3-cm diameter) to a depth of 20 cm.Fresh soil samples were homogenized and sievedthrough a 2-mm mesh. Sample aliquots for enzymeactivities and PLFA analyses were stored at -80/C176C.
Samples for the determination of available nutri-ents and microbial biomass and activity werestored at 4/C176 C for a maximum of 14 days. Sub-
samples for CEC, C
tot, and N totdeterminations
were air-dried.
Abiotic Soil Properties
The pH of fresh soil samples was measured in 1 MKCl with a pH meter (1:5, w:v; pH 315i, WTW,
Germany). The cation exchange capacity (CEC)
was determined as the sum of base cations (BC:Ca
2+,M g2+,N a+, and K+) and exchangeable
acidity (Al3+and H+). BC content in soil was
measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry(Varian, Australia) in a 1 M NH
4Cl extract, and
Al3+and H+ions were extracted in 1 M KCl and
determined by titration according to Thomas
(1982 ). C totand N totwere measured using an
elemental analyzer (vario MICRO cube, Elementar
GmbH, Germany); total soil P (P tot) was deter-
mined according to Kopa ´cˇek and others ( 2001 ).
Soluble organic C and N (C exand N ex), repre-
senting pools of dissolved organic matter availablefor microorganisms (Wagai and Sollins 2002 ),
were extracted in duplicates from fresh soil (0.5 M
K
2SO4, 1:4, w/v; Rennert and others 2007 ) within
48 h after sampling and determined with a Li-
quiTOC II analyzer (Elementar, Germany). Theconcentrations of NH
4+and NO 3-in sulfate ex-
tracts were determined with a Flow InjectionAnalyzer (FIA Lachat QC8500, Lachat Instru-ments, USA). Extractable P (P
ex) was determined
in 0.5 M NaHCO 3(1:5, w/v) and measured with
an absorption spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S,UV–Vis, Thermo Scientiﬁc, USA).
Plant Biomass and Stoichiometry
To measure the amount of aboveground plantbiomass, three non-contiguous 20 cm 920 cm
squares were cut with scissors on the edges of thecentral 1 m
2of each plot in June 2010. The litter
was separated ﬁrst, and then the biomass was sor-ted into species, dried, and weighed. The biomassmean C, N, and P contents were calculated ascommunity-weighted averages of individual spe-cies (see Leps ˇand others 2011 for detailed
description and analysis).
Microbial Biomass and Activity
Microbial C (C mic), N (N mic), and P (P mic) were
determined by chloroform fumigation-extraction356 P. Kotas and others
57using kEC= 0.45 (Vance and others 1987 ),
kEN= 0.54 (Brookes and others 1985 ), and
kEP= 0.4 (Brookes and others 1982 ). Net N min-
eralization rate (sum of nitriﬁcation and ammoni-
ﬁcation; N min) was measured as the difference in
concentrations of NH 4+and NO 3-that occurred
between day 7 and day 21 of incubation at 20 /C176C,
divided by the number of days. C mineralization
(Cmin) was measured with a gas chromatograph
(Agilent 6850 Series, Agilent, USA) as the increasein CO
2concentration during 48 h of soil incubation
at 20/C176 C in bottles sealed with rubber covers.
To characterize the microbial potential to release
C, N, and P from organic substrates, activities of sixhydrolytic enzymes responsible for the acquisition ofC(b-glucosidase, cellobiosidase), N (Ala-aminopep-
tidase, Leu-aminopeptidase), and P (phosphatase,phosphodiesterase) were determined (Ba ´rta and
others 2013 ; Sinsabaugh and others 2009 ). Fresh soil
subsamples (1 g) were homogenized in distilled
water (100 ml) and enzyme activities were mea-
sured with standard ﬂuorometric techniques (Marxand others 2001 ). Based on the preliminary mea-
surements of saturation concentration of each 4-methylumbelliferone/7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-labeled substrate, we used 50 llo f5 0 lM substrate
solutions for the determination of b-glucosidase and
cellobiosidase activities, 200 lM substrate solution
for determination of phosphatase activity and
300lM substrate solutions for determination of
phosphodiesterase, Ala- and Leu-aminopeptidase
activities. All ﬂuorescence measurements were car-ried out using the microplate reader INFINITE F200(TECAN, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of365 nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm.
Microbial Community Structure:
Phospholipid Fatty Acid Proﬁle
The determination of phospholipid fatty acids
(PLFAs) was based on the method of Frostega ˚rd
and others ( 1993 ). Brieﬂy, 2 g of soil (dry weight)
was extracted twice with a single-phase extraction
mixture consisting of chloroform, methanol, and
phosphate buffer and consequently puriﬁed onsilica columns (SPE-SI 1 g/6 ml; Phenomenex
/C210,
CA, USA) using chloroform, acetone, and metha-
nol. The polar fraction was trans-esteriﬁed to the
fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) through mild
alkaline methanolysis (Bossio and Scow 1998 ). All
PLFAs were quantiﬁed by an internal standard
calibration procedure using methyl nonadecanoate(19:0) as the internal standard and six calibrationlevels of the following FAME standards: BacterialAcid Methyl Ester (BAME), the 37-componentFAME Mix, PUFA-2 and PUFA-3 (Supelco, Belle-fonte, USA), BR3 Mixture, methyl nonadecanoate,10-methyloctadecanoic acid and methyl 9(R),10(S)-methyleneoctadecanoate (Larodan lipids, Malmo ¨,
Sweden). To identify the FAMEs, retention timesand mass spectra were compared with those ob-
tained from standards. The PLFA proﬁle comprised
27 individual PLFAs and was used to compare themicrobial community composition betweenexperimental plots. The fatty acids i15:0, a15:0,i16:0, i17:0, a17:0, i18:0 were used as markers ofgram-positive bacteria ( G+) and 16:1n11, 16:1n9,
16:1n7, 16:1n5, cy17:0, 18:1n7, cy19:0 as markersof gram-negative bacteria ( G-) (Kaiser and others
2010 ); 10Me16:0, 10Me17:0 were considered as
actinobacterial (Kroppenstedt 1985 ) and 18:1n9,
18:2n6,9 as fungal markers (Frostega ˚rd and Ba ˚a˚th
1996 ). Total bacterial biomass is represented by the
sum of general bacterial markers 15:0, 17:0,18:1n5, 18:1n11 and markers for G+ and G-bac-
teria. The total amount of PLFAs was calculated asthe sum of all lipid markers mentioned above andnon-speciﬁc PLFAs 14:0, 16:0, 17:1n6, 18:0, 20:0
and 22:0 (Kaiser and others 2010 ). The fungi-to-
bacteria ratio (F/B) was calculated from the
respective sums of the above bacterial and fungalPLFA markers. The PLFA proﬁles were compared asmol% of PLFA for detection of structural changes
in the microbial community.
Statistical Analysis
We measured numerous biotic and abiotic soil
variables, some of which were signiﬁcantly corre-
lated. To achieve the best statistical power while
keeping the global Type I error low, we carried out
separate multivariate analyses for logical groups ofvariables, allowing us to describe the treatmenteffect on (a) soil physico-chemical properties, (b)plant biomass and stoichiometry, (c) plant com-munity composition, (d) microbial activity, (e)
microbial biomass and stoichiometry, (f) microbial
community structure (the PLFA proﬁle), and (g)
activity of C, N, and P hydrolyzing enzymes. We
used Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to test the effectof all treatments together and partial RDA to testthree main effects (that is, the signiﬁcance of fer-tilization, mowing or dominant removal using theremaining treatments as covariates) without stan-
dardization by samples, centering and standard-
ization by variables (because the variables were not
always measured at the same scale, see S ˇmilauer
and Leps ˇ2014 ) and a Monte Carlo simulation with
4999 permutations. We then examined each vari-
able separately with three-way ANOVA withFertilization, Mowing, and Removal of the Dominant Species 357
58interactions, followed by Tukey HSD tests. Principal
component analyses (PCA) on the physico-chemi-cal properties, plant community composition, andPLFA proﬁle were used to identify particular trends
connected with the applied treatments. To ﬁnd the
best candidates among soil physico-chemicalproperties for explaining shifts in the PLFA proﬁle,RDA with forward selection of explanatory vari-ables was used. We further correlated the samplescores of the ﬁrst three principal components ofPCA on the microbial PLFA composition and plantcommunity composition (see Table 8 in Online
Appendix C) to determine whether the microbial
PLFA proﬁles were related to plant communitycomposition. Consequently, the decomposition ofexplained variation (S ˇmilauer and Leps ˇ2014 ) was
used on selected parameters to quantify their un-ique and shared effects on the PLFA proﬁle.
Before applying the statistical analyses, data were
checked for normality and log-transformed if nec-
essary. All C:N:P stoichiometric ratios were calcu-
lated on a molar basis. Statistical tests with a P
value lower than 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.Multivariate statistical analyses were performedwith CANOCO for Windows version 5.0 (Ter Braakand S ˇmilauer 2012 ). ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests
were performed with Statistica 10 (StatSoft, USA).
RESULTS
Comparison of Treatment Effects on
Ecosystem Properties
Annual spring application of mineral NPK fertilizer
and regular mowing once a year were associatedwith signiﬁcant shifts in ecosystem properties (Ta-ble1). Both treatments signiﬁcantly affected plant
community composition, productivity and biomassC:N:P stoichiometry, with the largest proportion of
data variability explained by fertilization. Below-
ground, the soil physico-chemical properties andmineralization rates were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced,again more by fertilization than by mowing (Ta-ble1), but the microbial biomass and its C:N:P
stoichiometry remained unchanged. Fertilizationwas the only treatment that affected the microbialPLFA proﬁle. Removal of the dominant plant spe-
cies explained only a small fraction of the vari-
ability in plant and soil data (Table 1) and its effect
on the examined ecosystem parameters was notsigniﬁcant (shown by three-way ANOVAs withinteractions). Therefore, we present below the re-sults of two-way ANOVAs, comprising the effects offertilization, mowing, and their interactions.
Inﬂuence of Treatments on Soil Physico-
Chemical Properties
Fertilization signiﬁcantly acidiﬁed soil and de-
creased soil CEC and C totcontent, while signiﬁ-
cantly increasing soil P totand P ex. It also lowered C/
P and N/P ratios of both bulk SOM and the pools of
available nutrients (Table 2). The pronounced fer-
tilization effect is shown on the PCA ordinationdiagram, separating unfertilized (left) from fertil-ized (right) plots along the ﬁrst principal compo-nent (PC1) (Figure 1). Unfertilized plots were
further separated along the second principal com-ponent (PC2) according to the presence or absence

pointing to the signiﬁcant interaction of fertiliza-
tion and mowing. Mowing of unfertilized plots
signiﬁcantly lowered N exand increased the C ex/Nex
and C ex/Pexratios (Table 2; Figure 1), but this
negative effect of mowing on N exand P exwas
compensated when mown plots were fertilized. The
fertilized mown and fertilized unmown plots thusoverlaid in the right part of the PCA diagram
(Figure 1). The soil NO
3-content was reduced by
mowing, regardless of fertilization (Table 2).
Plant Response to Treatments
Fertilization stimulated aboveground plant pro-
ductivity, while mowing decreased the amount oflitter on experimental plots due to biomass removal
(Table 3). Mowing was the only management,which signiﬁcantly affected plant N content. It de-
creased N concentration in plant biomass, withconcomitant increase of plant C/N ratios indepen-
dent of fertilization (Table 3). Mowing and fertil-
ization further signiﬁcantly interacted in their
effects on plant stoichiometry. Fertilization of un-mown plots increased plant N and P concentrationscompared to unfertilized plots; therefore, vegeta-
tion in fertilized unmown plots had the lowest C/N
ratio from all treatments and lower C/P and N/Pratios than non-fertilized plants. Fertilization
combined with mowing lowered plant C content
and increased plant P but not N content, resultingin the lowest plant biomass N/P ratio of all treat-ments. The highest C/P ratio was determined inplant biomass from unfertilized mown plots (Ta-ble4).Table 2. Soil Physico-Chemical Characteristics (pH, CEC, Contents of C, N, and P and Their Molar Ratios),

60Microbial Response to Treatments
Neither the microbial biomass nor the microbial
C:N:P stoichiometry reﬂected signiﬁcant changes inthe elemental stoichiometry of SOM, availablenutrients, and plant biomass caused by the treat-ments. Among other microbial variables, only Cmineralization rate decreased in fertilized versusunfertilized plots. Mowing strongly decreased net Nmineralization rate in unfertilized plots, but this
was balanced by fertilization of mown plots (Ta-
ble5). Generally, the net N mineralization was
negatively correlated with the soil C
ex/Nexratio
(r=-0.69, P<0.001) and positively related with
soil N exand NH 4+contents ( r= 0.62 and 0.43,
P= 0.001 and 0.035, respectively). The potential
activities of extracellular enzymes for the acquisi-tion of C, N, and P were spatially variable and not
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the management inter-
ventions.
The relative abundance of G+ and G-bacteria,
actinobacteria, and fungi within microbial com-munity as well as the F/B ratio was unaffected. Allexperimental manipulations accounted only for17.2% of the variation in the microbial PLFA pro-ﬁle and their combined effect was not signiﬁcant
(Table 1; the alignment of PLFAs with experimen-
tal manipulations shown in Figure 3 in Online
Appendix D). Therefore, the ﬁrst two PCA com-ponents of the microbial PLFA composition did notdepict any trends connected with the treatments(PC1 and PC2 accounted for 34.6 and 18.7% ofvariation, respectively; see Table 8 in Online Ap-pendix C). However, the third principal component
(PC3, 13.8% of data variation) signiﬁcantly sepa-
rated microbial PLFA proﬁles in fertilized andunfertilized plots (Figure 2A), which corresponds
with a signiﬁcant fertilization effect on the micro-bial PLFA proﬁle (Table 1, results of the partial

particularly the bacterial markers were alignedalong the PC3 (Figure 2B). The fungal PLFAs

Microbial PLFA proﬁles were also related to plant

responsive to altered plant community composition
were saturated, mainly non-speciﬁc PLFAs (15:0,

exexplained 22% of the variability
in the PLFA proﬁles ( P<0.001). The results from
variation partitioning show that 7.5% of the total
variation in the PLFA proﬁles was explained by pH
and the C/P exratio ( P= 0.017) and 5.5% solely by
PC1 and PC3 of the plant community composition(P= 0.034). The rest of the explained variability
(9%) was shared by these variables.
DISCUSSION
Fertilization Effects on Vegetation, Soil,
and Microbial Characteristics
In agreement with our ﬁrst hypothesis, regular spring
application of NPK fertilizer (78 kg N ha-1y-1,
123 kg P ha-1y-1and 123 kg K ha-1y-1) for
16 years exerted the strongest inﬂuence on both
above- and belowground ecosystem characteristics of
all treatments. Long-term fertilization brought aboutnegative changes in basic soil physico-chemicalproperties such as decreased soil pH and CEC, ascommonly reported in grassland fertilization exper-iments (for example, Silvertown and others 2006 ;
Clark and others 2007; Liu and others 2014 ), and
increased nutrient availability in the soil. This was
reﬂected aboveground in the vegetation composi-
tion, where nutrient loading increased the abun-dance of competitive species like Scirpus sylvaticus L.
and nitrophilous Urtica dioica L. in unmown plots,
and of grasses (for example, Agrostis capillaris L.,A.
canina L.,Festuca rubra L.) in mown plots. These
plants outcompeted other species, including the ini-tially dominant Molinia , and caused a sharp decrease
of species richness (see Leps ˇ1999 ,2004 ,2014 for
details).

63Even though the new plant communities were
more productive, the amount of soil C totdecreased,
indicating an overall loss of SOM. The only element
found in greater amounts in the fertilized soil was
P, but its presence mainly in exchangeable forms
indicated physico-chemical sorption rather than
incorporation into stabilized SOM. Our datashowing a negative fertilization effect on SOMcontent are in agreement with the results of ameta-analysis of fertilization effects on grasslandsby Sillen and Dieleman ( 2012 ). However, other
studies have shown varying effects of N fertilization
on SOM content, from the absence of any signiﬁ-
cant change in C content in mineral soils across
biomes (Liu and Greaver 2010 ) to an increase in
soil C sequestration (Conant and others 2001 ;
Rousk and others 2011). The ambiguous image
arising from these studies indicates that the fertil-ization effect on SOM content depends on manyfactors, such as the fertilization dose, the type of
fertilizer, the longevity of fertilization, the ecosys-
tem type, and its initial conditions. While an in-
crease in SOM after grassland fertilization iscommonly explained by enhanced input of organicmatter due to increased primary production (Ny-borg and others 1997 ; Rousk and others 2011 ), a
decrease in SOM used to be ascribed to an en-hanced decomposition of new, nutrient-rich or-
ganic matter and its priming effect on the old SOM
(Bengston and others 2012 ; Kuzyakov 2010 )a s
well as a declining plant belowground allocation(Bardgett and others 1999 ; Eisenhauer and others
2012). In our case, exoenzymatic activity andmicrobial biomass were not changed and microbialrespiration even decreased, which indicated a de-crease rather than an increase in potential SOM
decomposition after 16 years of NPK fertilization.
We thus suggest that the decrease in soil C
totshould
be ascribed to lower root production, which iscommonly observed after fertilization (Bardgettand others 1999 ; Eisenhauer and others 2012 ;
Kasˇtovska ´and others 2012 ). The signiﬁcantly in-
creased aboveground productivity could not avertthe loss of SOM, because the aboveground litter did
not signiﬁcantly contribute to soil C sequestration
in this grassland. This was shown by the absence ofdifferences in soil C
totcontents between mown
plots, where the aboveground biomass is removed,and unmown plots with signiﬁcantly more litter
left on site (see Tables 2,3), independent of fertil-
ization. A likely explanation is the signiﬁcantly
faster decomposition of aboveground litter com-
pared with belowground litter (Freschet and others
2013). Our results show that the effect of long-termfertilization on SOM content is a function ofbelowground rather than aboveground plant pro-duction. These ﬁndings are in line with theprominent role of belowground plant production inSOM formation suggested by Freschet and others
(2013 ).
We further hypothesized that the resulting
changes in microbial biomass and activity in re-
sponse to management would be mainly driven bythe treatment effects on SOM content and nutrientavailability (Hypothesis 3). This was supported bythe signiﬁcant correlations across treatments be-tween the SOM content and microbial biomass C as
well as C mineralization ( r= 0.754 and 0.674,
respectively, both P<0.0001). Similar relation-
ships were found in other fertilization studies
(Treseder 2008 ; Sillen and Dieleman 2012 ). Fur-
thermore, C mineralization was also controlled bythe relative C availability, as shown by its signiﬁ-cant correlations with C
ex/Nexand C ex/Pexratios
(r= 0.512 and 0.433, P= 0.011 and 0.035,
respectively). Across all plots, C mineralizationdecreased together with decreasing availability of Crelative to N and P, whereas absolute C availability(C
excontent) was not affected. This decrease can-
not be ascribed to more efﬁcient microbial meta-bolism when nutrient availability is higher, assuggested, for example by Agren and others ( 2001 ),
because the ratios of mineralized to total C and
mineralized to microbial C did not signiﬁcantly
change (data not shown). Instead, we conclude
that long-term nutrient loading decreased C avail-
ability relative to N and P and thus strengthenedthe C limitation of microbial metabolism, as sug-gested by Kamble and others ( 2013 ). In summary,
we suggest that fertilization signiﬁcantly not onlydecreased the inputs of belowground plant litter to
the soil but also decreased mineralization of pre-
existing SOM due to a stronger C limitation of
microbial activity. In the long-term, however, the
lower microbial activity could not compensate forthe lower input of root-derived compounds, whichresulted in reduced C sequestration in the soil ofthis grassland.
Mowing Effects on Vegetation, Soil, and
Microbial Characteristics
In agreement with our ﬁrst hypothesis, mowing
had a weaker inﬂuence on ecosystem properties
than fertilization. In contrast to fertilization,mowing increased plant species richness and spatial
homogeneity of species composition (Leps ˇ2014 ).
The long-term annual removal of aboveground
plant biomass decreased soil nutrient availabilitycompared with soil from unmown and fertilizedFertilization, Mowing, and Removal of the Dominant Species 363
64grasslands, which corroborates our hypotheses.
This was indicated by lower availability of N and Prelative to C, lower concentration of soil-availableN (both N
exand NO 3-) and increased C/N and C/P
ratios in plant biomass in comparison with un-mown plots. Nutrient depletion was further indi-cated by signiﬁcantly decreased plant abovegroundproductivity in plots that were only mown. Besidessoil N availability, net N mineralization also sig-niﬁcantly decreased in mown plots, suggestingmore efﬁcient N recycling between plants and mi-crobes (Kas ˇtovska ´and others 2014 ) and thus tigh-
ter plant–microbe interactions in the mowngrassland (Bardgett and others 1999 ; Paterson
2003; van der Heijden and others 2008 ).
Some grassland studies have reported increased
C allocation belowground and stimulation of soilmicrobial biomass and activity following mowing(Bardgett and others 1998 ; Guitian and Bardgett
2000; Uhlı ´r ˇova´and others 2005 ; Zhang and others
2013). We found no permanent mowing effect onthe biomass or activity of microbes in this long-term experiment, although such an effect couldpotentially be considerable in the short term fol-lowing plant defoliation. In summary, mowing (onits own) decreased nutrient availability in the sys-tem, leading to more closely coupled plant–microberelations driving a more efﬁcient N cycling. These
changes did not affect soil microbial biomass and its
activity and had no effect on the SOM content inthe long term. Considering the deﬁnitely positiveeffects on plant community composition anddiversity, annual mowing is the most convenientmanagement for sustaining species-rich wet grass-lands.
Combined Effects of Mowing and
Fertilization
It was recently shown that mowing can partially
prevent the decline of plant species richness caused
by fertilization (Leps ˇ2014 ). This led us to formulate
Hypothesis 2 that combination of mowing andfertilization could compensate for a slow depletionof soil nutrients connected with long-term biomassremoval (Venterink and others 2009). In support of
our hypothesis, we found that fertilization ofmown plots enhanced relative nutrient availability,
as evidenced by signiﬁcantly lower C/N and C/P
ratios of soil extractable pools. The avoidance ofnutrient depletion was further documented bysigniﬁcantly higher plant aboveground productiv-ity and strongly increased plant P content in com-parison with plots that were only mown. We alsodocumented a positive effect of mowing on Nrecycling within the fertilized system, similar tothat described above in mown-only plots. In plotsunder combined management, mowing decreasedsoil nitrate concentration as compared with fertil-
ized-only plots and thus decreased the potential for
N losses from the fertilized grassland.
However, mowing did not counterbalance the
soil acidiﬁcation and decrease in CEC directlyconnected with the application of mineral NPKfertilizer. Mowing also did not change the trend ofdecreasing SOM content and concomitant decreasein C mineralization and soil microbial biomass.
These soil characteristics are among soil attributes
adversely connected with maintaining soil qualityand sustainable ecosystem productivity (To ´th
2008 ). Therefore, we summarize that mowing
combined with annual application of NPK fertilizerat the given dose compensated only for nutrientdeﬁciency caused by long-term grassland mowingbut did not balance out negative changes in the soil
caused by fertilization. Combination of these two
management forms thus does not preserve soilfunctioning and the existing diversity of plantcommunity in the longer term.
Effects of Dominant Species Removal on
Vegetation and Soil Characteristics
The removal of Molinia caerulea had a positive effect
on plant species richness, but the changes were
much less pronounced than the effects of fertiliza-tion and mowing (Leps ˇ2014 ). However, Molinia
removal did not cause any signiﬁcant changesbelowground. The evaluation of removal effects onsoil properties was further complicated by the factthat Molinia was found to retreat spontaneously
after fertilization and mowing, being replaced byother species in a way similar to the plots where itwas selectively removed (Leps ˇ2004 ). Even though
studies of microcosms (for example, Bardgett and
others 1999 ; Kasˇtovska ´and others 2014 ; Legay and
others 2016 ) and complex plant communities
(Lange and others 2015 ) demonstrated regulation
of microbial abundance and activity as well as Cand N turnover by plant species traits, we found noevidence that removal of a single plant species, al-though dominant, induced a permanent effect onthe soil environment in species-rich grassland.
Shifts in Microbial Community
Composition as an Adaptation to Soil andVegetation Changes
Microbial community composition was signiﬁ-
cantly affected only by NPK fertilization. The364 P. Kotas and others
65changes we found within PLFA proﬁles were re-
lated mainly to soil acidiﬁcation and decreasing C/Pratio of the soil solution, which corroborates withour third hypothesis. Soil pH was previously noted
as a key factor driving microbial community com-
position (Fierer and others 2009 ; Rousk and others
2010a ,b; Rousk and others 2011 ) and fungi-to-
bacteria ratio (Ba ˚a˚th and Anderson 2003 ). In
agreement with this, soil acidiﬁcation signiﬁcantlyaltered the microbial PLFA composition even
though the overall pH range in our experiment
stretched only from 4.18 to 3.85. These ﬁndings
emphasize the need to consider carefully even very
slight changes of soil pH when evaluating fertil-ization effects on microbial community composi-tion. In accordance with observations by Ba ˚a˚th and
Anderson ( 2003 ) and Rousk and others ( 2010a ),
only PLFA speciﬁc to bacteria were sensitive to
changes in soil physico-chemical properties (see
Table 7 in Online Appendix B), but these changes
within bacterial PLFA had no effect on the fungi-
to-bacteria ratio. High sensitivity of bacteria to soilpH was previously demonstrated also by gene-based molecular techniques (Fierer and others2009; Rousk and others 2010a ) and can be ascribed
to the narrow pH ranges for optimal growth ofbacteria (Ferna ´ndez-Calvin ˜o and Ba ˚a˚th2010 ). The
speciﬁc bacterial PLFAs 18:1n7, 16:1n7, 16:1n5,
cy19:0, and i16:0 have been noted previously as
sensitive indicators of direct pH effects on themicrobial community (Ba ˚a˚th and Anderson 2003 ;
Rousk and others 2010b ; Rousk and others 2011 ).
Among those, only 18:1n7 and 16:1n5 respondedsigniﬁcantly to soil pH changes in our study and wecan thus recommend them as widely applicable
sensitive indicators of the microbial response to
changing pH. The likely explanation of the rela-
tively weak response could be the narrow range of
acidiﬁcation in our experiment.
Shift in microbial PLFA proﬁles was not only
related to soil pH and soil solution C/P ratio but alsoto plant community composition. The proportionsof variability in the PLFA proﬁles explained by soil
characteristics (7.5%) and by altered plant com-
munity composition (5.5%) were comparable.
However, unlike the pH-related changes, shifts in
vegetation composition affected the whole PLFAproﬁle, including speciﬁc bacterial and fungalmarkers and many non-speciﬁc PLFAs, with theonly exception of actinobacterial markers (see Ta-ble 7 in Online Appendix B). Such a widespread
response of the microbial community to shifts in
plant species composition is likely connected with
potential variation in the quantity and quality of
biochemical compounds provided by differentplants (De Deyn and others 2008 ) and varying re-
sponses of different microorganisms to the alteredplant inputs into the soil (Orwin and others 2010 ).
The relation between plant and microbial com-
munity compositions indicates mutual adaptation
of plant and microbial communities to particulargrassland management types and supports thesuggestion of speciﬁc plant–microbe interactions(for example, Bardgett and others 1999 ; Hartmann
and others 2009 ; Orwin and others 2010 ; Doornbos
and others 2012 ).
CONCLUSIONS
Long-term annual NPK fertilization of oligotrophicspecies-rich grasslands had a negative effect on the
whole system. Aboveground, plant species richness
decreased, and belowground, the soil was acidiﬁedand depleted of cations, and although C mineral-ization decreased, total SOM storage was reduced.Mowing as the single form of management has thepotential to preserve plant diversity and decrease
nutrient losses through microbial activity and
leaching. Management combining fertilization with
mowing effectively maintained the high plant
species richness only in the short term. In the longterm, it signiﬁcantly reduced N leaching from thesystem but did not prevent SOM depletion, acidi-ﬁcation and concomitant adverse effects on soilmicrobes. Our results show that making decisionsabout sustainable grassland management should be
based on long-term studies and take into consid-
eration responses above as well as belowground.
Here, our results indicate that belowground plantproduction, driving an input of organic matter di-rectly into the soil proﬁle, had a more importantrole in affecting soil C storage in the long term thanaboveground plant production. The conservationefforts on species-rich oligotrophic meadows
should target extensive use by low-frequency
mowing but the concomitant nutrient depletion
should not be compensated for by regular NPK
fertilization due to its adverse effects on soil quality.

Abstract  
The unique and fragile High Arctic ecosystems are vulnerable to proceeding 
global climate warming. Elucidation of factors driving microbial distribution 
and activity in Arctic soils is essential for comprehensive understanding of the 
ecosystem functioning and its response to environmental change. The goals of 
this study were to investigate the microbial biomass, activity, microbial 
community structure (MCS) and their environmental controls in soils along 
three elevational transects in coastal mountains of Billefjorden, Central 
Svalbard. Soils from four different altitudes (25, 275, 525, and 765 m above sea 
level) were analysed for a suite of characteristics including temperature 
regimes, organic matter content, base cation availability, moisture, pH, basal 
respiration, and microbial biomass and community structure using 
phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). We observed significant spatial heterogeneity 
of edaphic properties among transects, resulting in transect-specific effect of 
altitude on most soil parameters. We did not observed any clear elevation 
pattern in the microbial biomass and the microbial activity revealed 
contrasting elevational patterns between transects. We found relatively large 
77horizontal variability in MCS, mainly due to different composition of bacterial 
PLFAs, but also systematic altitudinal shift in MCS related with different 
habitat preferences of fungi and bacteria, resulting in high fungi to bacteria 
ratios at the most elevated sites. Our data further showed that the biological 
soil crusts on these most elevated, unvegetated sites can host microbial 
assemblages of the size and activity comparable with the arctic tundra 
ecosystem. The key environmental factors determining horizontal and vertical 
changes in soil microbial properties were soil pH, organic carbon content, soil 
moisture and Mg2+ availability. 
 
1 Introduction  
Knowledge about the spatial distribution and activity patterns of soil microbial 
communities is essential to understand ecosystem functioning as the soil 
microbes play fundamental role in biogeochemical cycling and drive 
productivity in terrestrial ecosystems (van de Heijden et al., 2008). The soil 
microbial diversity in the Arctic is comparable to that in other biomes (Chu et 
al., 2010) and the spatiotemporal variability in microbial community 
composition is large (Lipson, 2007; Blaud et al., 2015; Ferrari et al., 2016).  
However, it is still uncertain which environmental factors drive the 
heterogeneity of soil microbial properties in the Arctic. 
 Altitudinal transects offer great opportunity to study a distribution of 
microbial communities adapted to local habitats and explain the patterns by 
natural gradients of soil conditions, vegetation occurrence and climate regimes 
over short spatial distance s (Ma et al., 2004; Körner et al., 2007). The 
proceeding climate change will further affect environmental conditions in the 
Arctic (Collins et al., 2013) including expected upward migration of the 
vegetation and increasing plant cover (Vuorinen et al., 2017; Yu et al. 2017). 
Therefore, the knowledge of current microbial distribution and activity 
patterns along the altitudinal gradients together with identifying their 
controlling factors can help to predict future development of ecosystems in 
this region. However, such studies are scarce despite the fact that Arctic tundra 
comprises 5% of the land on Earth (Nemergut et al., 2005) and most coastal 
areas in the northern circumpolar region have mountainous character. So far, 
only few studies assessing altitudinal trends in soil microbial properties were 
78conducted in the Scandinavian Arctic (Löffler et al., 2008; Männistö et al., 
2007). The research on spatial variation in microbial community composition 
and activity in polar regions was conducted mainly at narrow elevation range 
(Oberbauer et al., 2007; Trevors et al., 2007; Björk et al., 2008; Chu et al., 2010; 
Van Horn et al., 2013; Blaud et al., 2015; Tytgat et al., 2016) or was focused on 
initial soil development following glacier retreat (Bekku et al., 2004; Yoshitake 
et al., 2007; Schűtte et al., 2010). Majority of studies on the elevational patterns 
in microbial community structure (MCS) and activity has been done in 
mountain regions of lower latitudes from tropics to temperate zone. The 
studies commonly show that the microbial activity decreases with increasing 
elevation (Schinner, 1982; Nikli ńska and Klimek, 2007; Margesin et al., 2009), 
while there are no general altitudinal patterns in soil microbial diversity and 
community structure. For example, the mic robial community composition did 
not change along elevational gradients in Swiss Alps (Lazzaro et al., 2015), 
while other studies have documented decreasing bacterial (Ma et al., 2004; 
Lipson, 2007; Shen et al., 2013) and fungal (Schinner and Gstraunthaler , 1981) 
diversity with an increasing altitude, and several studies reported the mid ‒
altitudinal peak in microbial diversity (Fierer et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2012; 
Meng et al., 2013). Beside the fungal and bacterial diversity, the relative 
abundance of t hese main microbial functional groups is also variable. For 
example, Djukic et al. (2010), Xu et al. (2014) and Hu et al. (2016) found 
decreasing fungi to bacteria (F/B) ratio with an increasing elevation, while 
Margesin et al. (2009) reported opposite tre nd in Central Alps.  
 The research focusing on environmental controls over microbial 
communities in polar and alpine regions recognized many significant factors, 
including vegetation, litter C : N stoichiometry, organic carbon content, soil pH, 
nutrient availability, microclimatic conditions, and bedrock chemistry. 
However, the effect of these variables was site- and scale-specific (Van Horn et 
al., 2013; Blaud et al., 2015; Ferrari et al., 2016), which highlights the need for 
further research on environmental controls of microbial community size, 
activity and structure at local and regional scales. To extend our knowledge 
about microbial ecology and soil functioning in the arctic alpine ecosystems, 
we conducted study aiming to assess the activity, biomass and structure of soil 
microbial communities and to determine their controlling environmental 
factors along three altitudinal transects located in Central Svalbard. These 
transects spanned from the vegetated tundra habitats at the narrow areas at 
79the sea level to unvegetated soils at the top of the coastal mountains. The 
specific objectives of our study were (i) to describe gradients of microclimatic 
and geochemical soil properties ; (ii) to assess microbial activity (soil 
respiration) and abundance of main  microbial groups (fungi, Gram ‒negative 
and Gram ‒positive bacteria, Actinobacteria, phototrophic microorganisms) 
using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis; and (iii) to identify 
environmental factors explaining the trends in soil microbial parameters a long 
these altitudinal gradients .  
 
2 Materials and methods  
2.1 Study area and soil sampling 
The Petunia bay (Billefjorden; 78 ° 40´ N, 16°  35´ E) is located in the center of 
Svalbard archipelago and represents typical High Arctic ecosystem in the 
northern circumpolar region. The mean, minimum and maximum air 
temperatures recorded in the area at 25 m above the sea level (a.s.l.) were ‒
3.7, ‒28.3 and 17 °C in the period of 2013‒ 2015, respectively, and stayed 
permanently below 0 °C for eight months a year (Amb rožová and Láska, 2017). 
The mean annual precipitation in the Central Svalbard area is only 191 mm 
(Svalbard Airport, Longyearbyen, 1981‒2010) and is equally distributed 
throughout the year (Førland et al., 2010).  
 In August 2012, we collected soils from three altitudinal transects (Tr1 ‒3) 
on the east coast of Petunia bay. Each transect was characterized by four 
sampling sites at altitudes 25, 275, 525 and 765 m a.s.l. (± 5 m). Transects were 
located on slopes with similar exposition (Tr1 W ‒E, Tr2 WNW ‒ESE, Tr3 
WSW ‒ENE; Fig. 1) and lithostratigraphy. Soils at the lowest elevations 
developed from Holocene slope (Tr1 and Tr3) and marine shore deposits 
(Tr2), while the bedrock at more elevated sites is formed by dolomite and 
limestone with units of basal calcareous sandstone (Dallmann et al., 2004). The 
soils were classified as Leptic Cryosols (Jones et al., 2010) with loamy texture 
and clay content increasing with altitude (Table 2), and were from 0.15‒0.2 m 
to only few cm deep at 25 and 765 m a.s.l., respectively. The poorly developed 
organic horizon was present only at the lowest elevation. The sampling 
locations were selected in geomorphologically stable areas with a similar slope 
80(20±5°). On each sampling site, nine so il cores (4 cm deep, 5.6 cm diameter) 
were collected and mixed into three representative samples. Each 
representative sample was mixed from one soil core taken from the edge of the 
vegetation tussocks (if vegetation was present) and two other cores taken i n 
increasing distance from the vegetation to maintain the consistency with 
respect to heterogeneity of vegetation cover and soil surface. The triplicates 
were collected approximately 5 m apart from each other. Immediately after 
sampling, the soil was sieved (2 mm) to remove larger rocks and roots, sealed 
in plastic bags and kept frozen at ‒20 °C till further processing. Soil 
subsamples for biomarker analysis were as soon as possible freeze‒dried and 
stored at ‒80 °C until extraction.

sheet C7, Svalbard 1:100 000, Norwegian Polar Institute 2008. 
 
81 Transects represented climosequences from high Arctic tundra to 
unvegetated bare soil. Vegetation of two lowest sites was dominated by Dryas 
octopetala , with significant contribution of Saxifraga oppositifolia,  and variable 
contribution of Cassiope tetragona, Salix polaris and grasses ( Carex nardina, C. 
rupestris, C. misandra ; Prach et al., 2012; personal observations). The vascular 
plants species formed scattered vegetation patches at the altitude of 525 m 
a.s.l. with Salix polaris  and Saxifraga oppositifolia being the most abundant 
species. The soils at the most elevated sites were covered mainly by soil crusts 
with scarcely occurring Saxifraga oppositifolia and Papaver dahlianum 
(personal observations). The percentage cover of main surface types (i.e. 
stones, bare soil, vegetation, crusts and mosses) was estimated on each 
sampling site from approximately 1m2 area in a close vicinity of coring sites 
(Table S1, Fig. S6). 
 
2.2 Monitoring of microclimatic characteristics 
To describe the soil microclimatic conditions along the altitudinal transects, 
we continuously measured soil temperature at ‒5 cm from 2012 ‒2013 
directly at the sampling sites of Tr1 using dataloggers (Minikin Ti Slim, 
EMS Brno, CZ). The soil water content  at the time of sampling was 
determined in soil subsamples by drying to constant weight at 105 °C. The 
temperature regimes at particular altitudinal levels were characterized by 10 
climatic variables (Table 1). The period of above‒zero daily mean ground 
temperatures is referred to as summer season throughout the text. We also 
considered number of days with daily mean ground temperatures above 5 
°C, characterizing a period with conditions suitable for vascular plant growth 
(Kleidon and Mooney, 2000). The positive soil surface energy balance  was 
calculated as a sum of daily mean summer temperatures. The records from 
three years (2011‒2013) continuous measurements at two automated weather 
stations located at 25 and 455 m a.s.l. approximately 3 km apart from the  
observed transects (hereafter referred as AWS 25 and AWS 455, respectively; 
Fig. 1; see Ambrožová and Láska, 2017 for detailed description) were used 
to evaluate seasonal variation of soil temperature and moisture regimes 
(Figs. S2, S3, respectively), and c oupling of soil and atmospheric 
82temperatures (measured at -5 cm and 2 m above terrain, respectively; Fig. 
S2). Even though we were not able to continuously measure soil moisture 
directly at the sampling sites, we regarded data from both AWS locations as 
representative for the evaluation of seasonal moisture regimes. 
2.3 Soil characteristics  
The particle size distribution was assessed using aerometric method 
(Lovelland and Whalley, 2001), the soil type was classified according to U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. The soil pH was determined in soil‒water mixture 
(1:5, w/v) using glass electrode. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) was 
considered to be equal to the sum of soil exchangeable base cations Mg2+, Ca2+, 
Na+, K+ extracted with 1M NH 4Cl (Richter et al., 1992). The amount of H+ and 
Al3+ ions was neglected due to the high soil pH. Base cations accessible for 
plant and microbial uptake (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+) were extracted by the Mehlich 
3 reagent (Zbíral and Němec, 2000). Cations were measured by atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (AA240FS instrument, Agilent Technologies, USA) . 
Total soil organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) contents were measured in 
HCl fumigated samples ( Harris et al., 2001) using elemental analyser ( vario  
MICRO cube, Elementar, Germany).  
2.4 Microbial respiration  
Since we were not able to measure soil respiration on site or immediately after 
soil collection, we measured the potential respiratory activity (soil CO 2 
production) in the laboratory incubation experiment. We stored and 
transported the soils frozen because it was previously demonstrated that 
freezing-thawing has a weaker effect on microbial activity than long-term 
refrigeration (Stenberg et al., 1998) and comparable effect as drying-rewetting 
(Clein and Schimel, 1994). We then measured microbial respiration in slowly 
melted field-moist soils twice during the adaptation period (day 4 and 12), 
which allowed stabilization of the microbial activity after a respiratory flush 
following freeze-thaw events (Schimel and Clein, 1996), and at day 13, when 
we expected a stabilized microbial activity. Briefly, soil subsamples (10 g) were 
incubated in 100 mL flasks at 6 °C, which corresponds to the mean summer 
soil temperature of all sites along Tr1. At days 4, 12 and 13, a cumulative CO 2 
production from the soils was measured using Agilent 6850 GC system (Agilent 
83technologies, CA, USA). The flasks were then thoroughly ventilated and sealed 
again. Due to high soil pH, the total amount of produced CO 2 was corrected for 
its dissolution and dissociation in soil solution according to Henderson-
Hasselbach equation (Sparling and West, 1990) and expressed as the microbial 
respiration rate per day. The daily microbial respiration rates measured 
between days 4-12 and after stabilization (day 13) were not significantly 
different in any soil samples, therefore, we present only the later one. 
 
2.5 Microbial biomass and community structure  
The soil microbial community structure was defined using PLFA analysis 
according to modified protocol of Frostegård et al. (1993) . Briefly, 1 -3 g 
(according to TOC content) of freeze ‒dried soil samples was extracted twice 
with a single ‒phase extraction mix ture consisting of chloroform, methanol and 
citrate buffer. After overnight phase separation achieved by adding more 
chloroform and buffer, the organic phase was purified on silica columns (SPE ‒
SI Supelclean 250mg/3 mL; Supelco®, PA, USA) using chloroform,  acetone and 
methanol. The polar fraction was trans ‒esterified to the fatty acid methyl 
esters (FAME) (Bossio and Scow, 1998). All FAMEs were quantified by an 
internal standard calibration procedure using methyl -nonadecanoate (19:0) as 
an internal standard . To identify the FAMEs, retention times and mass spectra 
were compared with those obtained from standards (Bacterial Acid Methyl 
Esters standard, the 37 ‒component FAME Mix, PUFA ‒2, and PUFA ‒3; Supelco, 
USA). The ISQ mass spectrometer (MS) equipped with Fo cus gas 
chromatograph (GC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used for 
chromatographic separation and detection.  
 Only specific PLFAs were used to assess the microbial community 
structure: a14:0, i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, i17:0, a17:0 were used as markers of 
Gram ‒positive bacteria (G+); 16:1ω9, 16:1ω5, cy17:0, 18:1ω11, 18:1ω7, 
cy19:0 as markers of Gram ‒negative bacteria (G ‒); 10Me16:0 and 10Me18:0 
as markers of Actinobacteria (Kroppenstedt, 1985 ), 18:1ω9, 18:2ω6,9 as 
fungal markers (Frosteg ård and B ååth, 1996)  and polyunsaturated fatty acids 
18:4ω3, 20:5ω3 were used as markers of phototrophic microorganisms 
(Hardison et al., 2013; Khotimchenko et al., 2002). A sum of Actinobacterial 
markers, PLFAs specific to G+ and G ‒ bacteria and general bacterial markers 
15:0, 17:0 and 18:1ω5 was used to calculate bacterial biomass and fungi to 
84bacteria (F/B) ratio. The sum of all lipid markers mentioned above and 
nonspecific PLFAs 14:0, 16:0, 18:0 and 16:1ω7 was used as proxy for microbial 
biomass ( PLFA tot). 
 
2.6 Sterol analyses  
The β ‒sitosterol and brassicasterol were used as biomarkers of plant 
(Sinsabaugh et al., 1997) and microalgal (Volkman, 1986; 2003) residues in 
organic matter (OM), respectively. Sterols were simultaneously determined 
using microwave assisted extraction adapted from Montgomery et al. (2000) 
and GC/MS ( ISQ MS equipped with Focus GC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)  
analysis. Briefly, 0.5 g of freeze ‒dried soil was treated with 6  mL of methanol 
and 2 mL of 2  M NaOH. Vials were heated twice at the c entre of a microwave 
oven (2450 MHz and 540  W output) for 25 s. After cooling, the contents were 
neutralized with 1  M HCl, treated with 3  mL of methanol and extracted with 
hexane (3×4 mL). Extracts were spiked by an internal standard (cholesterol), 
evapora ted and derivatized by adding of pyridine and 1 % BSTFA at 60 °C for 
30 min prior analysis. Sterols were quantified by an internal standard 
calibration procedure.  
2.7 Statistical analyses  
All data were checked for normality and homoscedasticity, and log ‒
transformed if necessary. The relative PLFA data (mol%) were log-
transformed in all statistical tests. The significance of environmental gradients 
and corresponding shifts in MCS (mol% of summed PLFA specific for fungi, G ‒ 
and G+ bacteria, Actinobacteria and soil phototrophic microorganisms) in 
horizontal direction (ie. effect of transect) and vertical direction (ie. effect of 
altitude) were tested using the partial redundancy analyses (RDA) with 
covariates. Variation partitioning was subsequently performed to quantify the 
unique and shared effects of transect and altitude on variability of MCS. 
Forward selection procedure was used to identify the soil geochemical 
parameters best explaining the shifts in MCS. During the forward selection 
procedure, only P values adjusted by Holms correction were considered. This 
procedure is slightly less conservative compared to the often recommended 
Bonferroni correction, but it is a sequential procedure and takes into account 
85that the candidate predictors with stronger effect were selected first (Holm, 
1979). The multivariate tests were performed without standardization by 
samples, but with centering and standardization by variables (because the 
variables were not always measured at the same scale, see Šmilauer and Lepš 
2014) and Monte Carlo test with 1999 permutations. Only adjusted explained 
variation is referred throughout the text. Since the samples from each triplicate 
cannot be considered as independent observations due to relatively low inter -
sample distance (otherwise we had 9 independent transects), only the 
sampling sites were freely permuted while the individual samples were 
exchangeable only within the sampling sites. The differences in particular soil 
and microbial parameters between respective transects and altitu des were 
addressed by ANOVA complemented with Tukey ‒HSD post hoc test. To find 
out how tightly were variables related to each other, Pearson correlation 
coefficient was used. All statistical tests were considered significant at P < 0.05. 
Multivariate stati stical analyses were performed with CANOCO for Windows 
version 5.0 (Ter Braak and Šmilauer 2012), for ANOVA, Tukey -HSD test and 
correlations between soil and/or microbial parameters, Statistica 13 was used 
(StatSoft, USA) . 
 
3 Results 
3.1 Altitudinal changes in soil microclimate  
The soil microclimate at the studied sites was characterized by two distinct 
periods respecting the air temperature dynamics (compare Fig. S2a with S2b). 
The winter period lasted typically from the middle of September to early June. 
The winter soil temperatures were stratified according to the elevation and the 
temperature means decreased from ‒4 °C at 25 m a.s.l. to ‒10 °C at 765 m a.s.l. 
(Table 1, Fig. S2). In contrast, a short summer period was characterized by a 
significant diurnal fluctuation of soil temperatures and weak altitudinal 
temperature stratification (Fig. S2). The length of the summer season more 
than doubled at the lowest elevations compared to the most elevated st udy 
sites, while the period with daily mean soil temperatures above 5 °C shortened 
almost four  times. Correspondingly, the positive surface energy balance 
gradually decreased with an increasing altitude  (Table 1).  
86 
 
The maximum daily mean temperatures and diurnal temperature fluctuation 
were highest at the mid‒ elevated sites, with the highest mean summer soil 
temperature reached at 275 m a.s.l. In contrast, the least and most elevated 
sites experienced lower summer maximum daily means and soil temperature  
amplitudes  (Table 1).  The effect of altitude on soil moisture was significant 
along Tr1 and Tr3 ( P < 0.001 and 0.01, F = 22.76 and 7.39, respectively) with 
soil moisture content decreasing along with increasing elevation, but 
nonsignificant along Tr2. Con tinual volumetric measurements of soil water 
content at AWS 25 and AWS 455 showed that the soil moisture was relatively 
stable during the summer season and desiccation events did not occur during 
the summer periods 2011 ‒2013 (for more information, see Fig. S 3). 
 
3.2 Gradients of soil geochemical properties and surface vegetation cover 
Both factors, transect and altitude, significantly affected soil geochemical 
properties (partial RDA, pseudo ‒F = 8.3, P < 0.001) and explained 61% of the 
total variation in soil characteristics. The RDA ascribed most of the explained 
variability (73%) to vertical zonation. Accordingly, the effect of altitude was 
significantly reflected in all soil parameters (Table 2, 3, Fig. S4), but the 
significant interactive effect between transect and altitude indicated that the 
elevational trends were in most cases specific for particular transects (Tables 
2, 3). Especially the CEC and availabilities of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+ were 
spatially variable, reflecting complicated geology of the Petunia bay area. The 
soils along Tr1 were significantly richer in available Mg2+ and K+ than soils 
from other two transects (Table 2). The Mg2+ availability also significantly 
increased with increasing elevation along the Tr1 (Table 2). Other soil 
properties showed more systematic altitudinal patterns. The mean soil pH 
ranged from 7.8 to 9.0 and increased with altitude along all transects (Table 2 ,

 and origin. The percentage of plant cover also continuously decreased with an 
increasing elevation along Tr1 and Tr3 but was comparable on the three lower 
sites along Tr2 (Fig. S5), which significantly resembled the trends in soil OM 
content ( r = 0.53; P = 0.001). The lichenized soil crusts were predominant type 
of soil surface cover at all sites, while mosses covered very small proportion of 
surface area. The bare surface without any vegetation (bare soil) occurred only 
at the two most elevated sites (Fig. S5, Table S1). 
3.3 Soil microbial biomass and activity  
The soil PLFA content, used here as a measure of soil microbial biomass, was 
significantly correlated with soil TOC and TN contents ( r = 0.773 and 0.719, 
respectively; both P < 0.0001) and soil moisture ( r = 0.772; P < 0.0001), and 
negatively affected by Mg2+ availability  (r = -0.775; P < 0.0001). Despite these 
relations, the soil PLFA content did not show any altitudinal pattern. The soil 
PLFA amounts were comparable among differently elevated sites along 
particular transect (Fig. 2a). Only the m ost elevated site of Tr1 had 
significantly lower soil PLFA content than other sites, which corresponded 
with its very low stock of OM (Table 3). Similarly, neither the flush of microbial 
respiration measured after soil thawing (day 4 of incubation) nor the  
respiration measured after stabilization (day 12, not shown, and day13) 
showed any systematic altitudinal pattern (Fig. 3b, c). Generally, the flush 
respiration rate was closely related (r = 0.74, P < 0.0001, n = 36) to microbial 
respiration after stabili zation and ca 2.3 ± 0.3 times faster, showing similar 
freezing -thawing effect on the whole set of samples independently of altitude 
and transect. Along each transect, the three lower sites (from 25 to 525 m a.s.l.) 
had after stabilization comparable microb ial respiration rates, but the most 
elevated sites always differed - along Tr1 had the most elevated site 
significantly lower microbial respiration rate, whilst the most elevated sites 
along Tr2 and Tr3 produced markedly more CO 2 compared to remaining site s 
along these transects (Fig. 2b). The respiration rate was related neither to 
PLFA nor to TOC contents, but significant positive correlation with soil Ca2+ 
availability and F/B ratio, and negative correlation with Mg2+ availability ( r = 
0.489,  0.661and -0.545; P = 0.003, < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively) was 
observed.

 3.4 Microbial community structure  
The partial RDA revealed significant interactive effect of altitude and transect 
on MCS (pseudo ‒F = 4.8, P < 0.001). Both factors explained 51% of the total 
variation in the MCS, with 66 % of explained variability ascribed to altitude, 
26% to transect, and 8% of explained variability shared by both factors.

and the dotted line encases sites along the Transect 3 (Tr3). The numbers in

92 
 The soil geochemical variables explained 72% of the variation in the MCS 
(pseudo ‒F = 7.1; P < 0.001) indicating that the interactive effect of altitude and 
transect on MCS was largely driven by vertical and horizontal variability in soil 
properties. The forward selection of explanatory variables retained four 
geochemical parameters: Mg2+ availability, pH, moisture and TOC content, all 
together accounting for 55% of variation in the data (pseudo ‒F = 11.6, P < 
0.001). The most pronounced shift in the MCS was given by different 
altitudinal preferences of bacteria and fungi.

 The bacteria were consistently more abundant in the soils from lower 
elevations, having lower pH and higher TOC and moisture contents (Fig. 3). In 
general, PLFAs specific to G ‒ bacteria were more abundant than PLFAs of G+ 
bacteria (Fig. 4a; mean G ‒/G+ ratio ± SD = 1.76 ± 0.17; n = 36).  Oppositely, the 
fungal contribution to microbial community increased with an increasing 
altitude, at the sites having TOC poorer soils and higher pH (Fig. 3). Therefore, 
the F/B ratio gradually increased with an increasing altitude along all three 
transects (Fig. 4b). The significant interactive effect of altitude and transect on 
MCS was mainly connected with a strong effect of soil Mg2+ availability, which 
was higher along the whole Tr1 and differentiated its microbial communities 
from sites located along Tr2 and Tr3, where microbial communities of 
respective sites were more similar. The differences in MCS among the 
respective sites along Tr1 and other two transects further increased towards 
higher elevations in coincidence with an increasing soil Mg2+ availability along 
Tr1 (Fig. 3). In result, the TOC poorest and Mg2+ richest soil at the highest site 
on Tr1 had the most distinct MCS from all the sites. Its microbial community 
was characterized by higher abundance of Actinobacteria  and PLFAs of 
phototrophic microorganisms and much lower contribution of G‒ bacteria 
compared to communities of all other sampling sites (Fig. 3, 4a).  
 
4 Discussion 
4.1 Climatic and soil edaphic conditions along altitudinal transects 
The coastal area of the Petunia Bay in Svalbard is characteristic by ca four 
months lasting summer, long winter period ( Ambrožová and Láska, 2017)  and 
very low precipitations ( Førland et al., 2010 ). Our measurements in this area 
further showed that soils along an elevation gra dient from 25 to 765 m a.s.l. 
face significantly different microclimatic regimes. During winter, when the air 
temperatures varied a lot in time but less with elevation (Fig. S2b, data from 
AWS 25 and AWS 455), the soil temperatures were relatively stable but  
significantly stratified with altitude (Fig. S1, S2a). T he mean winter soil 
temperatures decreased from ‒4 to ‒10 °C along the elevation gradient from 
25 to 765 m a.s.l. (Table 1), which can strongly reduce winter soil microbial 
activity at high altitudes  (Drotz et al., 2010; Nikrad et al., 2016). In contrast, the 
mean summer soil temperatures did not reflect the site elevation (Table 1) and 
94 
 the comparison of temperature fluctuations, mean and maximum daily mean 
temperatures showed that the lowest and highest sites experienced during 
summer on average colder, but more stable soil microclimate compared to the 
mid ‒elevated sites (Table 1). However, the summer season prolonged with 
decreasing elevation and the increasing number of days with mean 
temperature ab ove 5 °C and a rising positive surface energy balance (Table 1) 
positively affected the occurrence and spreading of vascular plants ( Kleidon 
and Mooney, 2000; Klimeš and Doležal, 2010 ), which had strong implications 
for a transition of edaphic conditions a long studied elevation transects. 
Together with increased litter inputs and stocks of soil OM with lower C/N 
ratio (Table 3) was the plant growth associated with root respiration, cation 
uptake, and release of H+ and organic acids from roots, all together accounting 
for decreased soil pH (van Breemen at al., 1984). The increasing soil OM 
content was further positively related to soil moisture (Fig. 3). Interestingly, 
the soils in general did not suffer from desiccation (Fig. S3), commonly 
identified among t he most stressing factors in polar and alpine ecosystems 
(Ley et al., 2004; Van Horn et al., 2013; Tytgat et al., 2016), probably due to 
high cloudiness and fog occurrence (Sawaske and Freyberg, 2015) in the 
maritime climate.  
 The alkaline bedrock material resulted in high soil pH (7.8 –9) and high 
availabilities of basic cations, which were, however, spatially variable due to 
diverse geology of the studied area (Dallmann et al., 2004; Table 2). Beside 
clear altitudinal trends in soil edaphic conditions connected mostly with the 
soil OM content, the Mg2+ availability was recognized as main factor driving 
differences in soil microbial properties between transects (Fig. 3). In result, the 
character of the parent substrate mostly controlled soil microbial properties at 
the most elevated sites, which had generally low OM content and the most 
divergent MCS compared to lower located sites (Fig. 3). The highest site along 
Tr1 was the most extreme habitat among all the chosen sites, with the highest 
proportion of bare unvegetated soil surface (Fig. S5), the lowest OM and 
moisture contents, highest Mg2+ availability and soil pH, and consequently also 
the most distinct microbial characteristics (Fig. 2, 3). Towards lower 
elevations, the soil OM content became increasingly important and the 
microbial characteristics of the sites on different transects were more similar.  
 
4.2 Soil microbial properties along altitudinal transects  
The altitudinal shifts in soil edaphic properties were not significantly reflected 
in the soil microbial biomass and potential microbial respiration. Generally, the 
95 
 soil PLFA contents were comparable between all the sites along particular 
elevation transects, with the exception of very low soil PLFA concentration on 
the highest site of the Tr1 (Fig. 2a). There are no other studies from the High 
Arctic ecosystems reporting about altitude effect on soil microbial biomass. 
However, other studies conducted on alpine gradients in the temperate and 
boreal zones documented weak or absent altitudinal trends in the microbial 
biomass (Djukic et al. 2010, and Xu et al., 2014 using PLFA; Löffler et al., 2008 
using cell counts) but also a negative effect of elevation in the Alps (Margesin 
et al., 2009) and northewestern Finland (Väre et al., 1997). Importantly, none 
of the studies considered unvegetated habitats and all of them were conducted 
in soils with acidic or neutral soil pH. 
 Microbial respiration also did not change systematically with increasing 
elevation. The three lowest sites along each transect always had comparable 
soil microbial respiration rates (Fig. 2b), while soil microbial activities of the 
highest sites differed. The most elevated site on the Tr1 showed significantly 
lower respiration rates than the lower sites on this transect, which was in line 
with the lowest OM content as well as soil PLFA content. However, the soils 
from the highest sites on both Tr2 and Tr3 respired significantly more than the 
soils from lower sites on these transects, irrespective of relatively stable 
microbial biomass. This is in contrast to o ther studies, which reported 
decreasing microbial activity with increasing elevation (Schinner, 1982; Väre 
et al., 1997; Nikli ńska and Kli mek, 2007). However, these studies were 
conducted in lower latitudes and the studied altitudinal gradients did not 
include unvegetated habitats. To comment on and justify our results, we are 
aware that microbial activities were measured in freeze -stored and not fresh 
samples (see section 2.3 for details) and, therefore, the respiration rates 
measured after thawing show the potential activity of soil microbial 
communities in the soils. However, the respiration rates in three subsequent 
measurements (after fl ush, during adaptation and after stabilization) were 
positively correlated (r = 0.93 and 0.74, both P < 0.0001, n = 36), the ratios 
between the flush and stabilized respiration rates were comparable across all 
the soils (compare Fig. 2b and c) and  the abov e-described differences in 
microbial activities among the sites were consistent. Our data are in accord 
with the study of Larsen et al., (2002), who found comparable response to 
freeze -thaw events between two different arctic ecosystem types. We thus 
sugge st that the soils responded similarly to the storage treatment 
independently of site location and that observed differences in soil microbial 
activities are representative for the studied transects. Therefore, the higher 
soil microbial respiration at the m ost elevated sites  point to a higher lability of 
96 
 the present OM (Lipson et al., 2000; Uhlířová et al., 2007) and/or to a shift in 
microbial communities towards groups with higher potential to mineralize the 
OM (Gavazov, 2010; Djukic et al., 2013). Previous studies, considering either 
bare soil or vegetated habitats, reported rather increasing complexity of soil 
OM with elevation (Ley et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2014). However, in this study was 
majority of OM and microbial biomass at the most elevated sites associated 
with biological soil crusts with high algal and cyanobacterial abundance (Table 
S1, Fig. S5), known for their high microbial activity (Pushkareva et al., 2017; 
Bastida et al., 2014). The high microbial activity in the most elevated sites 
could be ascribed to prevalence of compounds of algal/cyanobacterial origin 
with very low portion of complex and slowly decomposable lignin and lignified 
compounds and protective waxes (like cutin and suberin) mainly derived from 
vascular plants. In accord, the sitosterol to brassicasterol ratio gradually 
decreasing with increasing elevation (Table 3) and increasing sitosterol 
content in the TOC pool at lower elevations pointed to growing importance of 
microalgal sources of OM in high elevation habitats (Sinsabaugh et al., 1997; 
Rontani et al., 2012). Even though both sterols can be found in higher plants 
and microalgae, the changing ratio indicates shift in the origin of OM (reviewed 
by Volkman, 1986, see also Volkman, 2003). Changes within microbial 
communities, which can also help to explain higher soil microbial respiration 
at the most elevated sites are discussed below. 
 Although the soil PLFA content did not change along the studied elevation 
transects, we have found a systematic altitudinal shift in the PLFA composition, 
resulting in significantly increasing F/B ratio towards higher elevations. This 
shift was best explained by a decreasing soil OM content and soil moisture and 
increasing pH (Fig. 3). Reports about soil F/B ratios and their altitudinal 
changes from the High Arctic are missing, but studies from lower latitudes 
showed either a similar trend of increasing F/B ratio with an altitude in the 
Alps (Margesin et al., 2009) or the opposite altitudinal effect in the Alps (Djukic 
et al., 2010) and Himalayas (Xu et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2016). Such divergent 
results indicate that altitude alone is not the key driving factor of the soil F/B 
ratio. In contrast to our observation, these studies reported very low soil F/B 
ratios of 0.05-0.2, which may indicate important role of fungi in functioning of 
the Arctic habitats. Soil pH was previously identified as the main driver of 
fungal-bacterial dominance in the soil (Baath and Anderson, 2003; Högberg et 
al., 2007; Rousk et al., 2009; Siles and Margesin, 2016). Fungi have been found 
more acid tolerant than bacteria, leading to higher F/B ratio in acidic soils 
(Högberg et al., 2007; Rousk et al., 2009; reviewed by Strickland and Rousk, 
2010). However, here we report high F/B ratios in the alkaline soils (pH 7.8 -
97 
 9.0) and increasing F/B ratios with an increasing soil pH. Similar trend was 
reported also by Hu et al., (2016), but the authors found F/B ratios one order 
of magnitude lower compared to our study. The possible explanation of 
generally high fungal abundance and in creasing  F/B ratio at more elevated 
sites, which are typical by unfavourable edaphic conditions and severe winter 
microclimate, could be higher competitiveness of fungi compared to bacteria in 
suboptimal conditions due to their wider pH (Wheeler et al., 19 91) and lower 
temperature (Margesin et al., 2003) growth optima. We further found that the 
increasing F/B ratio was significantly coupled with an increasing soil 
respiration (r = 0.649; P < 0.001). Indeed, such relationship can be related to 
higher fungal ability either to prosper in the soil conditions at the most 
elevated sites, or to utilize more efficiently available C sources (Ley et al., 2004; 
Bardgett et al., 2005; Nemergut et al., 2005; van der Heijden et al., 2008). In 
turn, the higher bacterial co ntribution at lower elevations may be associated 
with more benign soil conditions and bacterial preference for utilization of 
labile root exudates released by vascular plants (Lipson et al., 1999; Lipson et 
al., 2002). Since the projected warming in the Ar ctic (Collins et al., 2013) will 
likely cause an upward migration of the vegetation and increasing plant cover 
in detriment of lichens and biological soil crusts (Vuorinen et al., 2017; Yu et al. 
2017; de Mesquita et al., 2017), the soil microbial communit ies will likely 
respond by decreasing F /B ratios at higher elevations.  
 Apart from the systematic altitudinal shift in the F/B ratio, we observed a 
strong shift in the bacterial composition, which differentiated the altitudinal 
trends in the soil MCS along  Tr1 from trends along Tr2 and Tr3.  This 
difference between transects increased towards higher elevations and was 
best explained by Mg2+ availability (Fig. 3). The soils from Tr1, except the 
lowest site, had a lower  G‒ to G+ bacterial  ratios  within microb ial communities 
than soils from other two transects. Further, the microbial community of the 
most elevated site along Tr1 was significantly more contributed by 
actinobacteria and phototrophic microorganisms compared to all other sites 
(Fig. 3, 4a). It is k nown that the high Mg2+ availability inhibits growth of many 
soil bacterial species. The observed inhibitive Mg2+ levels were 5 and 50 p.p.m 
for G ‒ and G+ bacteria, respectively  (Webb 1949) , indicating that these 
bacterial groups significantly differ in their tolerance for enhanced Mg2+ levels.  
Considering half of available Mg2+ in soil solution and average soil moisture 
content 20%, the Mg2+ concentrations ranged approximately from 16 -140 
p.p.m,, which could explain decreased abundance of G - bacteria in sites with 
high Mg2+ availability.  This inhibitive Mg2+ effect further corresponds with the 
negative correlations between  Mg2+ availability and soil microbial biomass and 
98 
 respiration found in our study, and could explain the lower microbial biomass 
and respiration in the soils from Tr1. Our data thus indicate that beside the 
traditionally identified drivers of microbial activity and MCS such as soil OM 
content, moisture and pH, Mg2+availability is in important factor shaping the 
microbial environment along the arctic altitudinal transects on dolomitic 
parent materials.  
5 C onslusions  
The results obtained in this study have shown significant altitudinal zonation 
of most edaphic properties, but also significant spatial heterogeneity in 
horizontal direction, resulting in transect-specific effect of altitude on abiotic 
soil properties. Our data demonstrated that soils on the most elevated, 
unvegetated sites around the Petunia Bay can host microbial assemblages 
comparable in size and activity with the tundra ecosystem. The high microbial 
biomass and activity at the most elevated sites were almost exclusively 
associated with biological soil crusts, largely contributed by fungi. However, 
their development was retarded on some sites by high pH, low moisture and 
high Mg availability, resulting in pronouncedly low OM content, microbial 
biomass and distinct MCS. Despite the ubiquitous occurrence of soil crusts, the 
gradually increasing plant productivity and litter inputs down along transects 
were associated with decreasing soil pH, increasing OM content and soil 
moisture. Concurrently, the soil edaphic and microbial properties become 
more uniform. As the rise in temperatures and humidity predicted by climatic 
models will likely cause an upward migration of the vegetation and increasing 
plant cover, the higher plant litter inputs will overreach the influence of parent 
material and entail an increasing abundance of bacteria and decreasing F/B 
ratio in the summer microbial assemblages.

The grey area indicates time of sample collection in 2012. Note the stable soil water 
content from July until September. The volumetric measurement enable to determine 
soil water content only in a liquid state, which explains the very low water content in 
frozen soils during the winter period. These technical limitations explain also 
conspicuous fluctuations of soil water content during transient periods between 
winter and summer season, resulting from freeze ‒thaw cycles when temperature 
oscillated around zero.

Abstract 
The occurrence of dark fixation of CO 2 by heterotrophic microorganisms in soil 
is generally accepted, but its importance for microbial metabolism and soil 
organic carbon (C) sequestration is unknown, especially under C-limiting 
conditions. To fill this knowledge gap, we measured dark 13CO 2 incorporation 
into soil organic matter and conducted a 13C-labelling experiment to follow the 
13C incorporation into phospholipid fatty acids as microbial biomass markers 
across soil profiles of four tundra ecosystems in the northern circumpolar 
region, where net primary productivity and thus soil C inputs are low. We 
further determined the abundance of various carboxylase genes and identified 
their microbial origin with metagenomics. The microbial capacity for 
heterotrophic CO 2 fixation was determined by measuring the abundance of 
carboxylase genes and the incorporation of 13C into soil C following the 
augmentation of bioavailable C sources. We demonstrate that dark CO 2 fixation 
occurred ubiquitously in arctic tundra soils, with increasing importance in 
deeper soil horizons, presumably due to increasing C limitation with soil depth. 
Dark CO 2 fixation accounted on average for 0.4, 1.0, 1.1, and 16 % of net 
respiration in the organic, cryoturbated organic, mineral and permafrost 
horizons, respectively. Genes encoding anaplerotic enzymes of heterotrophic 
microorganisms comprised the majority of identified carboxylase genes. The 
genetic potential for dark CO 2 fixation was spread over a broad taxonomic 
range. The results suggest important regulatory function of CO 2 fixation in C 
limited conditions.  The measurements were corroborated by modelling the 
long -term impact of dark CO 2 fixation on soil organic matter. Our r esults 
suggest that increasing relative CO 2 fixation rates can explain, at least in part, 
116 
 the soil internal C cycling and the isotopic enrichment of soil organic matter 
with soil depth.

1 Introduction 
Terrestrial ecosystems represent a major sink of CO 2 through fixation by plants 
but they have been shown to mitigate the rise of atmospheric CO 2 also via 
microbial CO 2 fixation (Ge et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2012). Microbial CO 2 fixation 
has been mostly ascribed to autotrophic microorganisms (Ge et al., 2016), but 
fundamentally all microorganisms may use inorganic C (IC; i.e. CO 2 or 
bicarbonate) in their metabolism. All these fixations require energy generated 
by phototrophic, autotrophic or heterotrophic energy sources. IC is the main or 
even the only C source for chemoautotrophs and photoautotrophs, while 
heterotrophs and mixotrophs rely on organic C (OC) but also incorporate IC via 
a variety of carboxylation reactions that are part of their central or peripheral 
metabol ic pathways (for review see Erb, 2011; Wood and Stjernholm, 1962) . 
The importance of carboxylases in heterotrophic metabolism increases 
whenever microorganisms experience C limitation through a disproportion 
between C demand for energy generation and growt h and its availability, 
caused by deficiency or complexity of OC sources, or fast growth (Alonso -Saez 
et al., 2010; Feisthauer et al., 2008; Merlin et al., 2003) . Even though the 
occurrence of dark and largely heterotrophic CO 2 fixation in soils is general ly 
accepted, very few studies have assessed its relevance for soil microorganisms 
(Miltner et al., 2004, 2005a, b; Šantrůčková  et al., 2005) . Estimates of the 
importance  of soil CO 2 fixation for the  C balance in certain ecosystems or 
within  an entire soil profile are rare (Ge et al., 2016 ; Yuan et al., 2012)  and 
analys es of diversity and abundance of carboxylases are missing  entirely . 
 Soil OC becomes progressively enriched in 13C with increasing soil depth 
(Bird et al., 2002; Gentsch et al., 2015; Nadelhoffer and Fry, 1988; Torn et al., 
2002) . There are several explanations but no one can fully explain the 
measured isotopic shift. The enrichment of soil OC with depth can be 
connected with decrease of δ 13C of atmospheric CO 2 by 1.3 ‰ due to Suess 
effect ( McCarroll and Loader, 2004 ), with preferential decomposition of 
different organic compounds and microbial fractionation during litter 
117 
 decomposition or mixing of new C input with old soil OC (Buchmann et al., 
1997; Ehleringer et al., 2000, Šantrůčková  et al., 2000). Another hypothesis 
that has been discussed but never supported experime ntally states that soil 
microbes should be isotopically heavier as a result of carboxylation reactions 
(Ehleringer et al., 2000) . Whenever carboxylation reactions are in volved, CO 2 
molecules used in the reactions likely originate from the soil atmosphere, 
which is isotopically heavier than the organic materials being decomposed 
(Cerling et al., 1991) . The 13CO 2 enrichment of bulk soil atmosphere is highest 
in the uppermos t soil horizons, where CO 2 originates mostly from the 
atmospheric air. In deeper horizons of the soil profile, CO 2 originates from 
organic matter decomposition and carries the isotopic signal of decomposed 
material. But still CO 2 remaining in the soil that surrounds microbes is 4.4 ‰ 
heavier than organic matter at the location due to slower diffusion of heavier 
13CO 2 than lighter 12CO 2 (Cerling et al., 1991) . CO 2 hydrogenation causes further 
enrichment of 13C in HCO 3- by 8 to 12 ‰ , depending on temperature (Mook et 
al., 1974) . HCO 3- is accepted by many carboxylases operating in a variety of 
carboxylation reactions, including PEP and biotin carboxylases (Berg et al., 
2010; Supplement Appendix B Table SB1) , while CO 2 is used as an ac tive 
species by  Rubisco, the most abundant autotrophic carboxylase. Accordingly, 
incorporation of IC through microbial processes and accumulation of microbial 
products in soil theoretically might increase the isotopic signal (δ13C) of OC.  
 In arctic permafrost soils, high soil moisture, the presence of a permafrost 
layer and accumulation of fine particles on the interface between active and 
permafrost layers (Bockheim and Tarnocai, 1998; Makeev and Kerzhentsev, 
1974) restrict air diffusion through the soil profile. Arctic permafrost soils are 
also a large reservoir of OC whose bioavailability is limited, among other 
factors, by the OC subduction into subsoil via cryoturbation and the 
subsequent formation of mineral-organic associations (Gentsch et al., 2015) . 
High moisture content and the presence of a permafrost horizon restrict air 
diffusion through the soil profile, which may favor pockets and microsites with 
elevated CO 2 concentration. Under such conditions, CO 2 fixation might play a 
more important role than in well-aerated temperate soils. In addition, net 
primary production and soil carbon input are known to be low in northern 
ecosystems.  
 The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of dark CO 2 fixation in arctic 
soils. We postulated that (i) dark CO 2 fixation is a common attribute of arctic 
118 
 soils and occurs across the whole soil profile. We further hypothesized that (ii) 
various pathways of CO 2 fixation are operative in soil and distributed among 
different members of the soil microbial community, including heterotrophs, 
and (iii) CO 2 incorporation increases 13C enrichment of organic carbon with soil 
age. To test the hypotheses, we measured isotopic signal δ13C in OC, IC 
incorporation into OC, and abundances and taxonomic affiliations of 
carboxylase genes by shotgun metagenomics in soils across a range of tundra 
ecosystems from Eastern Siberia to Greenland, covering entire soil profiles. A 
simple model based on measured data was employed to elucidate a possib le 
effect of IC incorporation on δ13C of OC. In addition, 13C-labelling experiments 
with soil from one location were performed under aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions and the incorporation 13CO 2 into OC was addressed by analyzing the 
13C incorporation into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) as microbial 
biomarkers. To gain supporting evidence of heterotrophic CO 2 fixation, CO 2 
incorporation into OC, abundance of carboxylase genes and changes in 
microbial community composition after augmentation of bioavailable C were 
measured as well.  
 
2 Material and methods 
2.1 Soil sampling 
We sampled soils from four different arctic tundra types (heath tundra, 
tussock tundra, shrub-moss tundra and graminoid tundra) that belong to the 
bioclimatic subzones E and D (Walker et al., 2005), also called southern tundra 
and typical tundra subzone in the Russian classification: (i) The heath tundra 
site was located in eastern Greenland close to the Zackenberg Research Station 
(ZK; 74° 29’ N, 20° 32’ W). (ii) The tussock tundra site w as located 
approximately 80 km north of Cherskii (CH; 69° 26’ N, 161° 44’ E). iii) The 
shrubby moss tundra site was on the Taymyr peninsula in the north of central 
Siberia (Ari Mas, AM; 72° 30’ N, 101° 39’ E). (iiii) The graminoid (moss) tundra 
was also on  the Taymyr peninsula, a little bit north of AM (Logata, LG; 73° 25’ 
N, 98° 16’ E). All areas are in the continuous permafrost zone and thaw depth 
during sampling reached 65 -90 cm (samples were collected in late summer, 
close to the time of maximum active layer depth) . All soils were classified as 
Turbic Cryosols according to World Reference Base ( IUSS Working Group WRB  
119 
 2007) and as Turbels according to Soil Survey Staff (2010). Two types of soil 
samples were used in this study, one for the general screening of dark CO 2 
fixation and a second one for more detailed microbial and molecular biological 
analyses. 
 (i) Soil samples for measuring natural abundance of bulk soil 13C and dark 
CO 2 fixation (see section 2.2) were obtained on each site from extensive soil 
sampling for assessment of C storage and distribution (Palmtag et al., 2015) . 
Briefly, soil pits were excavated down to the permafrost and the active layer 
was sampled using a fixed volume cylinder. Samples from permafrost were 
collected by coring with a steel pipe (5 cm in diameter) that was hammered 
into the soil at 5-10 cm depth increments. Samples representative of the 
uppermost organic, cryoturbated organic (pockets of cryoturbated topsoil 
material) , and adjacent active mineral layers and permafrost h orizons were 
quickly dried in thin layers and kept at 4 °C until analyzed (in total, 149 
samples from all sites). For detailed soil characteristics see Palmtag et al. 
(2015).  
 (ii) Soil samples for more detailed microbial and molecular analyses were 
taken from 5-m long active layer pits on Cherskii, Ari Mas and Logata sites.  Soil 
samples were taken from uppermost organic, mineral and cryoturbated 
horizons, as well as from the uppermost permafrost layer. One part of the 
samples was immediately stabilized wit h RNAlater and kept cold. After 
transporting the samples to the laboratory within 20 days, RNAlater was 
washed out with PBS buffer (Gittel et al., 2014)  and samples were deep -frozen 
and later used for DNA extraction and subsequent metagenomics. From the 
remaining material, living roots were carefully removed and the soil was kept 
at 4 °C  until analyzed for 13C. Soils from the AM site were also used for the 
microbial 13C incorporation  and C supplementation experiments (see sections 
2.3 and 2.4).  For basic so il properties we kindly refer to Table 1, while details 
are given in Gentsch et al. (2015).  
 
2.2 Screening of CO 2–C incorporation into OC across sampling sites 
Soil (0.2 g) was moistened to 80 % water holding capacity (WHC) in 10 ml 
vacutainers , which were covered by Parafilm and conditioned for 2 weeks at 
12 °C. The vacutainers were then hermetically closed and flushed with CO 2-free 
air. Thereafter, the headspace was enriched with 13CO 2 (99 at% [atomic %] of 
120 
 13C) to a final CO 2 concentration of about 1 % v/v, which is realistic for soil 
pores.  In fact, soil CO 2 concentration can fluctuate widely, and values of 1 -5 % 
v/v CO 2 are typical, although 10 % v/v and higher have also been recorded 
(Nobel and Palta, 1989) . The soil was incubated at 12  °C for 5 days in the dark 
under the same conditions as in the conditioning phase. At the end of the 
incubation period, the CO 2 concentration in the headspace was analyzed, the 
soil was immediately dried at 60 °C and analyzed for total C and N and 13C. All 
analyses were run in four replicates.  
 
2.3  CO 2–C incorporation into microbial biomass  
Soil taken from pits in the uppermost organic, mineral and cryoturbated 
horizons of the AM site was used in the 13CO 2 incorporation experiment. Soil 
moisture was adjusted to 80 % WHC for incubation under aerobic conditions 
and to 100 % WHC for incubation under anaerobic conditions. Before 
incubation with 13C-labelled CO 2, the soil was conditioned either for 2 weeks 
(aerobic incubation, four replicates for each horizon, 5 g soil) or 4 weeks 
(anaerobic conditions, four replicates for each horizon, 5 g soil) in hermetically 
closed 100 mL bottles at 12 °C in the dark to  allow microbial communities to 
stabilize. After soil con ditioning, half of the samples were used for initial soil 
analyses (controls used for determination of natural abundance of 13C in 
microbial biomass, extractable C and N pools, PLFA and bulk soil). The 
remaining bottles were flushed with CO 2-free air, and the headspace of each 
was enriched with 13CO 2 (99 at% of 13C) to a final CO 2 concentration of about 1 
% v/v. The soil was incubated for 5 days under the same conditions as used for 
the conditioning. At the end of the incubation period, respiration was 
meas ured and the soil was used for further analyses; one part of the soil 
sample was immediately dried at 60  °C and used for chemical and isotopic 
analyses and the other part was deep -frozen and used for PLFA determination.  
 
2.4  Effect of organic C supplement on CO 2 incorporation and carboxylase genes 
As in the previous experiment, soil taken from pits in the mineral and 
cryoturbated horizons of the AM site was used.  The soil was incubated only in 
aerobic conditions and conditioned in the same way as in the previous 
experiment. After conditioning , soils were amended with either sucrose or 
121 
 lipids extracted from soil (see below) as energy and C sources as follows: 
sucrose and lipids, respectively, were mixed with C-free silica sand and the 
mixture was then mixed with soil (sand/soil 1:2, w/w) to get a final 
concentration of the added C source of approximately 300 µg C per g dry soil. 
Control soil was mixed with sand only. The final soil mixture was moistened to 
80 % WHC with Veldkamp nutrient solution containing biotin (Veldkamp, 
1970). An aliquot of the soil mixture (of all treatments) was dried to determine 
the natural abundance of 13C before the incubation. The incubation with 13CO 2 
was carried out in four replicates for each treatment as described above. After 
5 days of incubation, soil respiration was measured, 1 g of soil mixture from 
each replicate was immediately dried (60 °C) for bulk C and 13C analyses and 
the remaining soil was deep-frozen (- 80 °C) for DNA extraction and 
subsequent metagenomics. The lipid mixture used for the soil C supplement 
had been extracted from soil slurry (equivalent of 450 g of dry soil 
supplemented by Veldkamp nutrient solution; Veldkamp , 1970) incubated on a 
shaker for 5 days. The slurry was subsequently centrifuged to remove excess 
of water and lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (1959) . A part 
of the resulting extract was fractionated using SPE (Strata SI -1000mg/6mL, 
Phen omenex, Torrance, CA, USA) to characterize the extracted lipids. We found 
that 25, 22 and 23 % belonged to neutral -, glyco - and phospholipid fractions, 
respectively, and 30 % was not held by the SPE sorbent and considered as non -
lipid fraction.  
 
2.5  Analytical methods 
Microbial biomass was estimated by chloroform-fumigation and extraction 
with 0.5 M K 2SO 4, and calculated as the difference in soluble C between the 
extracts from fumigated and non-fumigated soils, using K EC = 0.38 (Vance et al., 
1987). Extractable organic C was analyzed on a LiquicTOC II (Elementar, 
Germany).  Total CO 2 concentration in the headspace was measured with an HP 
5890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard, East Norwalk, CT, USA), equipped 
with a thermal conductivity detector, at the beginning and end of the 
experiment (after the addition of 13CO 2 and after the incubation, respectively). 
The total amount of CO 2 in the bottles (totCO 2, µmol) was calculated as the sum 
of the amount of CO 2 in the headspace and the amount of CO 2 dissolved in the 
soil solution (Sparling and West, 1990). Net respiration rate was estimated as 
122 
 the difference between totCO 2 at the beginning and the end of the experiment 
divided by the number of days of incubation. Analyses of total C and N and 13C 
contents of dried soil material were conducted with an NC Elemental analyzer 
(ThermoQuest, Bremen, Germany) connected to an isotope ratio mass 
spectrometer (IR-MS Delta X Plus, Finnigan, Bremen, Germany) . Prior to 
carrying out the analyses, all samples were tested fo r their carbonate content. 
No carbonates were detected (data not shown).  
 A binary mixing model was used to estimate the amount of the pulse-
derived 13C immobilized in the various C pools (bulk soil, PLFA):  
 
13C (µg g-1) = [(at% sample  - at% control ) / (99.90 - 1.10)] × C pool size (µg C g-1)  
  
where at% control  is the natural abundance in the control samples, at% sample is the 
13C abundance in the samples after labeling, 99.9 is the pulse 13C at% and 1.10 
is the at% of the ambient atmosphere. All results were normalized to total C 
content in order to eliminate differences in C contents of the soils. 
 PLFA were extracted from subsamples of 0.3 to 2 g dry soil containing 
comparable amounts of OC according to Frostegård et al. (1993) , with minor 
modification s. Purification of phospholipids was conducted on silica columns 
(SPE- SI Supelclean 250mg/3 mL; Supelco, PA, USA) using chloroform, acetone 
and methanol. Following trans -esterification (Bossio and Scow, 1998) , the 
concentration and isotopic composition of individual PLFAs was determined 
on a GC -IRMS system consisting of a Trace GC coupled to a Delta V Advantage 
IRMS via a GC Isolink interface (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); 
see Wild et al. (2014) for a detailed description of the instrument se tup. 
Concentration and isotopic composition of each PLFA were corrected for C 
added during methylation. The microbial community composition was 
described using PLFAs i14:0, i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, i17:0, a17:0 as markers of 
Gram -positive bacteria, 16:1ω9, 16: 1ω7, 16:1ω5, cy17:0, 18:1ω7, cy19:0 as 
markers of Gram -negative bacteria and 18:1ω9, 18:2ω6,9 as markers of fungi 
(Frostegård and Bååth, 1996) . Total bacterial biomass was calculated as the 
sum of general bacterial markers 15:0, 17:0, 18:1ω5 and markers fo r Gram -
positive and negative bacteria. The PLFAs 14:0, 16:0, 16:1ω11, 18:0, 19:1ω8, 
and 20:0 were considered nonspecific markers (Kaiser et al., 2010) .  
 DNA was extracted from samples of cryoturbated (4 samples), mineral (2) 
and top soil (4) from Logata, AriMas and Cherskiy sites using bead-beating and 
123 
 the phenol-chloroform method (Gittel et al., 2014; Urich et al., 2008).  Total 
DNA was quantified using SybrGreen (Leininger et al., 2006) . In the case of the 
incubation experiment with added substrates (sucr ose or lipids), only the DNA 
from cryoturbated horizons (9 samples) contained a reasonable amount of 
DNA of high quality (Table 4). Sequencing of DNA from in -situ and incubation 
experiments was performed on an IonTorrent PGM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Walt ham, MA, USA ) sequencer at the Department of Archaea Biology and 
Ecogenomics (University of Vienna). Barcoded, adapter -ligated DNA libraries 
were generated and sequenced using 200 bp sequencing chemistry and 318 
chips according to the manufacturer’s instru ctions. Sequence reads were 
quality- trimmed (Phred score >20) and size- selected (>100 bp) before further 
processing. For the identification of carboxylase genes, all metagenome reads 
were translated into all six frames, with each frame into separate open r eading 
frames (ORFs), avoiding any ‘*’ characters marking stop codons in a resulting 
ORF. All ORFs equal to 30 amino acids or larger were screened for assignable 
conserved protein domains using reference hidden Markov models (HMMs) of 
the PfamA database (P unta et al . 2012; PfamA release 25, 
http://Pfam.janelia.org) with HMMER tools (http://hmmer.janelia.org/). All 
database hits with e-values below a threshold of 10−4 were considered 
significant (Tveit et al., 2015) . To obtain taxonomic information of reads with 
Pfam code, a BLASTX search implemented in diamond software (Buchfink et 
al., 2015)  was performed ( -minscore 50, -maxhits 25) and the resulting hits in 
sam format were analyzed by MEGAN 5.11.3 (Huson et al. 20 07) using the last 
common ancestor (LCA) algorithm (LCA parameters: MinScore 50, MaxExpect 
= 0.01, TopPercent = 10, MinSupport = 1) . 
 The calculations of carboxylase gene abundances per g soil were done by 
combining relative abundance of SSU rRNA genes of bacteria in the 
metagenomes with the number of bacterial SSU rRNA genes per g soil as 
determined by qPCR in the same DNA sample (Table SB2). The absolute 
number of carboxylase genes per g of soil was used for normalizing their 
abundance to soil C mic and/or OC contents. The molecular data were processed 
as follows: metagenome sequences encoding fragments of SSU rRNA genes 
were extracted with the program SortMeRNA (Kopylova et al., 2012), applying 
default parameters and the reference databases therein. Extracted reads were 
compared with BLASTN (Astchul et al., 1990) against the ARB Silva SSUref 
database v. 119 (Quast et al., 2012) and analyzed in MEGAN 5.11.3. 
124 
 Carboxylase reads were recalculated to absolute number of gene copies per g 
of soil by combining the absolute quantity of bacterial SSU rRNA genes and the 
amount of bacterial SSU rRNA reads determined by the MEGAN LCA algorithm 
in each metagenome, using the following formula: 
 
𝑞(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑥𝑦𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑒 )=𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑠(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑥𝑦𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑒)
𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑠(𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖 𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑆𝑈  𝑟𝑅𝑁𝐴 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒)∙ 𝑞(𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑆𝑈  𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒)  
 
where seqs(carboxylase)  is the amount of metagenome carboxylase gene 
sequences (assigned by hmmer algorithm using Pfam database), seqs(bacterial 
SSU rRNA gene)  is the amount of bacterial SSU rRNA gene sequences and 
q(bacterial SSU rRNA gene)  is the quantity of bacterial SSU rRNA genes (gene 
copies per g soil) determined by qPCR. 
 
2.6 Statistics and modeling  
A general linear model, followed by Newman-Keuls post-hoc testing, was used 
to determine the differences in C incorporation, respiration rate, bulk C 
content and isotopic signal between sites and horizons at a significance level of 
P ≤ 0.05. To compare total PLFA contents between control and 13CO 2-incubated 
samples in the laboratory experiment, one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls 
post-hoc test was used. Data were log -transformed in all cases except for total 
PLFA . Statistical evaluation of data was carried out with STATISTICA 13.  
 The statistical analysis of carboxylase genes was done using the statistical 
program R ( Team 2016). Because data were not normally distributed, 
generalized linear models with gamma distribution were used to test the 
significance of the effects of lipids or sucrose addition and soil h orizon, 
respectively, on the abundance of carboxylase genes. Soil horizons had unequal 
numbers of replicated measurements of carboxylase gene abundance. 
Therefore, we calculated the type- II F statistic using the package car (Fox and 
Weisberg, 2011) . Post -hoc multiple comparisons were carried out based on 
least -square means using the package lsmeans  (Lenth, 2016) . 
 In order to estimate tentatively the effect of CO 2 fixation on the isotopic 
signal of OC ( 13Ctot), we applied a simple model of microbial OC de composition 
(Fig. 1; for details see Supplementary Information Appendix A). Briefly, 
125 
 decomposition of OC by heterotrophic soil microorganisms (Mic) is a process 
with first-order kinetics. Organic C from decomposing organic matter with an 
initial isotopic signal of - 27 ‰ is consumed by soil microorganisms and 
respired or assimilated into microbial biomass. Microbial biomass is dying 
over time and becomes part of OC. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that 
no isotopic discrimination occurs during decomposition and microbial dying. 
Heterotrophic microorganisms largely depend on organic matter as C and 
energy source but under certain circumstances they use IC as additional C 
source (see introduction of this article for more details). We assume that 
microbes are capable of assimilating part of the respired CO 2 back and 
incorporate it into microbial biomass. Before CO 2 is fixed by soil 
microorganisms, an isotopic discrimination of 4 ‰ occurs because of the 
faster diffusion of 12CO 2 out of the soil. By fixing heavier CO 2, microbial biomass 
is becoming more enriched in 13C. When this microbial biomass is dying and 
becomes part of OC, OC becomes enriched in 13C as well. In the model, CO 2 
fixation is set to be proportional to respiration. Four scenarios were modelled, 
with CO 2 fixation making up 0, 0.1, 1 and 5 % of respiration, respectively. 
 
 
3 Results 
3.1 Screening for CO 2 fixation in arctic soils  
Sampling site and soil horizon significantly affected soil OC content and 
respiration rate (Table 2) while natural abundance of 13C in the soil (bulk 13C) 
and CO 2 incorporation were affected only by the type of soil horizon.  
Consequently, data from the particular horizons were averaged across 
sampling sites (Table 2). Across all sites, average bulk 13C in the upper organic 
horizon was - 27.3 ‰ at the start of incubation. In comparison with the upper 
organic horizon, the mineral, cryoturbated and permafrost horizons were all 
13C-enriched by 1.2, 1.1, and 2.7 ‰, respectively (Table 2). Incorporation of 
13CO 2-derived C per unit total OC was lowest in the upper organic horizon (4.9 
µmol 13C mol C tot-1d-1) and increased two- to three-fold in cryoturbated and 
min eral horizons (Table 2). In the permafrost horizon, 13C incorporation was 
higher by almost two orders of magnitude (Table 2). 13C incorporation reached 
0.4, 1.0, 1.1 and 16 % of net respiration in the organic, cryoturbated organic, 
126 
 mineral and permafrost horizons, respectively. When  13C incorporation was 
expressed per mol C of soil OM, it  also  increased with soil depth, and it rose  
exponentially with the 13C value of OC ((R2 = 0.44, n = 149, P <0.001 ; C incorp  = 
e^(21.09+0.72 13COC)).

 Carboxylase genes employed in autotrophic as well as heterotrophic 
metabolism were detected in metagenomes of all horizons and were not 
affected by site. However, the variability in absolute carboxylase gene counts 
between Siberian sites was large (Fig. 2a). Their abundances were higher in 
mineral horizons than in organic and cryoturbated horizons when normalized 
to microbial biomass (F = 4.2, df = 2, P = 0.02; Fig. 2a). However, deeper active 
layer horizons (mineral and cryoturbated) had lower abundances than organic 
horizons when carboxylase genes were normalized to total C (F = 4.1, df = 2, P 
= 0.02; Fig. SB1a). Genes encoding Rubisco contributed about 5 % (4.3-5.3  %)

 to the total abundance of carboxylase genes, whilst anaplerotic carboxylase 
genes (pyruvate and PEP carboxylase genes) were the most abundant 
carboxylase genes and contributed more than 30 % (31- 42 %).

(a), and in the cryoturbated layer from Ari Mas site, either unamended (control) or 
amended with organic C sources (b). Note that the scale on y axis is logarithmic. The 
standard deviation of absolute carboxylase gene counts was in some cases larger than 
average, only positive error bars are thus visualized.  
130 
 The 13C data of OC within the soil profile corresponds well with the model 
predictions (Fig. 4b). The estimates indicate that dark fixation of C released 
from decomposed OC could, after 1000 years, cause an increase of the isotopic 
signal of OC from an initial - 27 ‰ to -26.7 or - 15.2 ‰ when IC incorporation 
represents 0.1 or 5 % of net respiration, respectively (Fig. SA3). C 
sequestration via dark CO 2 fixation of 0.1, 1 and 5 % of net respiration, 
respectively, would add 0.1, 1.4 and 7.4 mg C per g soil, respectively, over a 
time frame of 250 years (Fig. SA6).  
 
3.2 C incorporation into microbial biomass at the AM site 
Under anaerobic conditions, CO 2 fixation was below the detection limit in the 
cryoturbated and mineral horizons and negligible in the upper organic horizon 
(0.251 µmol 13C mol C tot-1 day-1, corresponding to 0.1 % of net respiration). The 
anaerobic incubation is thus not discussed any further. During aerobic 
incubation neither microbial functioning (respiration rate) nor microbial 
biomass (total PLFA) (P > 0.3 for all horizons, df = 1, n = 3) or PLFA profiles 
were changed (Table SB3).  
 Bulk 13C incorporation ranged from 2.4 µmol 13C mol OC-1 day-1 in 
cryoturbated horizons to 7.6 µmol 13C mol OC-1 day-1 in the mineral horizons 
(Table 3), which corresponds well with 13C incorporation observed during the 
screening across all study sites. It represented less than 2 % of net respiration 
in the organic and cryoturbated horizons but exceeded 13 % in the mineral 
horizons . Of the total amount of 13C incorporated into the soil, generally less 
than 1 % of bulk 13C was found in PLFA biomarkers (13C PLFA to bulk 13C)  and 
less than 0.05 % of total PLFA -C was newly incorporated 13C (13C PLFA to PLFA 
C; Table 3). All detected PLFAs were enriched in 13C , but the distribution of 13C 
among PLFA marker s of individual functional groups showed that more 13C 
was incorporated into bacterial than fungal PLFA. The ratio of 13C in fungi to 
13C in bacteria increased from 0.20 in organic and cryoturbated horizons to 
0.45 in the mineral horizons. The significantl y higher fungal to bacterial PLFA 
ratio in the organic layers and lower ratio in mineral layers compared to the 
13C in fungal to 13C in bacterial PLFA (Table 3) indicate, that bacteria were 
more active in 13C incorporation per unit of biomass compared to f ungi in 
organic layers, but less active in mineral layers. Within bacteria, gram -negative 
131 
 bacteria incorporated three to four times more 13C into PLFA than gram-
positive bacteria (Table 3). The proportion of bulk 13C built into PLFA was 
higher in the organic and cryoturbated horizons than in the mineral horizons. 
Across all horizons, 13C incorporated into PLFA was closely correlated with net 
respiration rate RR (R2 = 0.89, n = 9; 13C(PLFA/OC) = 7.36 + 20.5 RR (CO2/OC) ).  
 
3.3 Effect of C addition on dark CO 2 fixation 
Addition of sucrose significantly increased net respiration rate in the mineral 
and cryoturbated horizons while addition of lipids had a positive effect only in 
the mineral soil. 13C immobilization ranged from 3.1 µmol 13C mol OC-1 day-1 
(cryoturbated horizon; control)  to 46.8 µmol 13C mol OC-1 day-1 (mineral 
horizon; sucrose addition) and increased in both the cryoturbated and mineral 
horizons in the order control < lipids < sucrose (Table 4).  
 
 
Across all treatments, IC incorporation was closely correlated with respiration 
rate (R2 = 0.91, n = 18; 13C(incorp/OC)  = 4.86 + 31.9 RR (CO2/OC) ). Both C substrates 
induced microbial growth (measured as an increase in DNA amount per gram 
soil; Table 4, Fig. 3a) in the cryoturbated horizon. Unfortunately, the amount of 
extracted DNA from the mineral soil was too small to be evaluated or used for 
further analyses. The increase of microbial biomass in the cryoturbated 
horizon was accompanied by a shift in the composition of the microbial 
community. Analysis of the SSU rRNA gene fragments in the metagenomes

thus a significant increase of carboxylase genes per unit of total C was

 observed with C source addition  (Fig. SB1b). Rubisco accounted for 13 to 18 % 
of total carboxylase and anaplerotic  carboxylase genes (pyruvate and PEP 
carboxylases) accounted for about 40 % (37 -46 %).  Taxonomic analysis of 
carboxylase genes revealed a link between PEP carboxylases and the 
composition of microbial community (Fig. S B3).

 4 Discussion  
4.1 General relevance of dark CO 2 fixation in arctic soils 
The available knowledge about dark CO 2 fixation is still very limited and can be 
summarized as follows: It  is a relevant process in the soil mediated by soil 
microorganisms, it is correlated with microbial respiration rate, it can be 
enhanced by addition of bioavailable OC, and it is related to microbial 
heterotrophic activity (Miltner et al., 2004; 2005a; Šantrůčková  et al., 2005) . 
Previous studies estimated that about 2 to 7 % of fixed CO 2 can be 
incorporated into microbial biomass (Miltner et al., 2004; Šantrůčková  et al., 
2005) .  In addition, this study documents that (i) IC incorporation increases 
with depth in the soil profile and is higher in the permafrost layers by more 
than one order of magnitude due to higher CO 2 fixation rate,  lower OC and 
higher CO 2 concentrations with depth; (ii) genes encoding Rubisco, the only 
enzyme operating strictly in autotro phic metabolism, account for a small part 
of all carboxylase genes only, while anaplerotic  carboxylase genes are several 
times more abundant; (iii) a wide spectrum of soil microorganisms contain 
genes encoding PEP carboxylases; (iv) IC incorporation may le ad to 13C 
enrichment of soil OC in the long -term and the increase is more pronounced in 
the deeper soil horizons. Across all study sites, IC incorporation expressed per 
unit of total C was higher in the mineral than in the organic horizons. The 
larger C in corporation in mineral horizons was accompanied by the highest 
abundance of all detected carboxylase genes per unit microbial biomass, 
suggesting that both the chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic pathways 
accounted for the larger IC incorporation in the min eral horizons as compared 
with the top soil. The significant proportion of anaplerotic carboxylase genes 
(pyruvate and PEP carboxylases) further emphasizes the importance of 
reactions replenishing central metabolic pathways under conditions where 
microbial  C demand exceeds C supply or where microorganisms catabolize 
complex hydrocarbons, the dominant fractions of OC in mineral horizons 
(Alonso -Saez et al., 2010; Feisthauer et al., 2008; Merlin et al., 2003) . It implies 
an important regulatory function of CO 2 fixation, which may enable microbes 
to keep activity in harsh conditions of C limitation.  
 
135 
 4.2 Link between dark CO 2 fixation and microbial communities 
We found less than 1% of fixed C in PLFA (0.2 -0.5 %), which is much less than 
it was found in bulk microbial cells (Miltner et al., 2004; Šantrůčková  et al., 
2005).  The low values can be explained by the fact that membranes constitute 
only about 4 % of cellular material and, th erefore, bulk microbial biomass 
should contain more fixed C. This suggestion is supported by Feisthauer et al. 
(2008) who found that the amount of fixed C in bulk microbial biomass is 
higher by one order of magnitude than that of fatty acids, indicating gr eater 
incorporation of fixed C into other cell components. Proteins, the most 
abundant component of cytoplasm, contain four to eight times more fixed C 
than PLFA (Miltner et al., 2004) .  
 The variety of detected carboxylase genes, the wide spectrum of bacteria 
linked to PEP carboxylase genes and significant 13C incorporation into all 
detected PLFAs including fungal markers imply a general importance of CO 2 
incorporation for the microbial community. This matches existing knowledge 
that, apart from chemoautotrophic bacteria and archaea, which use CO 2 as the 
only source of C (for review see Berg et al., 2010; Saini et al., 2011) a wide 
spectrum of heterotrophic bacteria and fungi employ carboxylases to (i) 
assimilate various organic substrates such as acetone, phenolics, propionate, 
or leucine, (ii) replenish the citric acid cycle in anaplerotic reactions and, 
finally, (iii) synthesize cellular compounds (e.g. Erb, 2011; Hesselsoe et al., 
2005). The significant increase in the amount of genes involved in CO 2 fixation 
belonging to predominantly heterotrophic genera ( Arthrobacter , Nocardioides  
and Pseudomonas ; Fig. SB2) after addition of sucrose or lipids indicate d 
increased potential of heterotrophic metabolism for additional IC  
incorporation into the bacterial biomass. 
 We found a positive effect of bioavailable C addition on IC incorporation, 
which contradicts our expectation that the importance of heterotrophic 
carboxylases would increase with any imbalance between C demand and 
supply (Alonso-Saez et al., 2010; Feisthauer et al., 2008; Merlin et al., 2003) . 
This apparent discrepancy might be partly explained by the increase of 
chemoautotrophic C fixation because of increasing CO 2 concentration in the 
system. A more likely explanation is that the added C initiated fast microbial 
growth as indicated by increased DNA concentration (Table 4), but was 
exhausted within days, microbes quickly became substrate limited an d 
136 
 microbial C demand exceeded C supply at the end of the experiment when the 
analyses were performed. Therefore, IC had to replenish C for microbial 
metabolism.  
 Even though we detected genes for key enzymes in various autotrophic 
pathways (e.g. Calvin Be nson Bassham cycle, reductive citric acid and 
reductive acetyl -CoA cycles, 3 -hydroxypropionate cycle, 4 -hydroxybutyrate 
cycle), we assume a negligible contribution of autotrophs to overall IC 
incorporation into OC. These chemoautotrophic pathways are, exce pt for the 
Calvin Benson Bassham cycle and 4- hydroxybutyrate cycle, operated by 
strictly anaerobic prokaryotes, and in our study the anaerobic CO 2 
incorporation was below the detection limit. We are aware that the 
contribution of the chemoautotrophic IC in corporation may be higher under 
natural conditions, but heterotrophy should be prevalent. This is supported by 
the generally lower growth efficiency of chemolithotrophic compared to 
heterotrophic growth, because the former requires more energy to produce a  
unit of biomass. In addition, carboxylases have low substrate affinity  and need 
a high concentration of IC for its effective incorporation into organic 
compounds (Bar -Even et al., 2012) . The most kinetically favorable 
carboxylases are anaplerotic PEP carb oxylases, the main carboxylase for 
replenishing the citric acid cycle, and pyruvate carboxylases (Bar -Even et al., 
2012) .  
 
4.3 Importance of dark CO 2 fixation for C sequestration 
We assessed the importance of dark  CO 2 fixation for C sequestration in the 
soils from two different perspectives: (i) promotion of microbial metabolism 
and (ii) role in soil C balance. With respect to the promotion of the 
heterotrophic metabolism, IC may be used as an additional C source to 
replenish central metabolic cycles (anaplerotic reactions) in situations when 
organic carbon is limiting and primarily used for energy production. In such a 
case, microbes may re -fix CO 2 that has been respired for energy production 
and thus minimize the over all loss of carbon. Carboxylation is also a vital step 
of fatty acid biosynthesis in general, and it enables the utilization of acetone by 
nitrate reducing bacteria (Acosta et al., 2014) . Inorganic C has a stimulatory 
effect, which is most apparent under l ow metabolic activity in resting aerobic 
and facultative cells (Harris, 1954)  and in the metabolism of resource -depleted 
137 
 bacteria (Alonso-Saez et al., 2010) . Inorganic C also serves as the only C source 
for a variety of obligate chemoautotrophs, either bac teria or archaea, which 
provide many metabolic pathways that are indispensable for soil functioning, 
such as oxidation of sulphur, ammonia, reduced metal ions, and methane 
production (Badger and Bek, 2008; Berg et al., 2007; Konneke et al., 2014) . 
With res pect to the role in the soil C balance, we consider a mean CO 2 release 
from tundra soil by soil respiration of about 76 g m-2 yr-1 (Fahnestock et al., 
1999). Our data thus indicate that re -use of 0.1 to 5 % of net respiration may 
account for dark fixation of 0.08 to 3.8 g C m-2 yr-1. Above -ground net primary 
production (i.e. IC incorporation into plant material) ranges from 10 to 500 g C 
m-2 yr-1 (Gould et al., 2003) . Thus microbial CO 2 fixation may correspond in the 
long term from 0.016 to 38 % of plant C fixation.  
 
4.4 Effect of dark CO 2 fixation on isotopic signal of OC   
In general, the 13C of organic matter mirrors the 13C of plant input in the 
uppermost horizons. However it increases with soil depth to values 1- 3 ‰ 
higher than in the uppermost organic horizon (e.g. Bird et al., 2002; Buchmann 
et al., 1997).  This was also observed for our arctic tundra soils (Tables 1, 2; 
Gentsch et al., 2015). The mechanisms behind this enrichment are still unclear 
and none of the following potential causes can fully explain it: isotopic change 
of atmospheric CO 2 and microbial processing of OC (Boström et al., 2007) , 
mixing of new C input with old soil organic matter (SOM) and microbial 
fractionation during litter decomposition (Ehleringer et al., 2000), increase of 
leaf internal to ambient CO 2 concentration (ci/ca) due to global change during 
the last 40 years (Betson et al., 2007). Similarly, the causes of the 13C-
enrichment of microbial biomass (Dijkstra et al., 2006; Šantrůčková  et al., 
2000) have not been satisfactorily resolved yet. Our results suggest that IC 
incorporation into microbial biomass and OC can contribute to soil microbia l 
biomass and OC enrichment. Our model of CO 2 fixation, which was 
parameterized using data from the same locations, indicates that in the long 
term, IC incorporation into OC can result in similar 13C-OC enrichments as 
measured for bulk soils in the deep so il. The model assumes CO 2 enrichment in 
the soil profile corresponding to 0.1 -5 % of net respiration, which is within the 
range of measured values. Unfortunately, the uncertainty connected to changes 
in isotopic signal of various soil pools during decompos ition process is high. 
138 
 Our model is therefore largely simplified and the predicted change of SOM 
isotopic signature is only tentative. We used several assumptions, which may 
affect model prediction. More specifically, we assumed that there is one pool of 
well mixed SOM with unique isotopic signal in soil which is decomposed at a 
constant rate. Including additional, more resistant SOM pool with the same 
isotopic signal would lead to lesser enrichment of SOM by heterotrophic CO 2 
fixation in long-term. It is, however, uncertain whether chemically different 
pools of SOM have the same isotopic signal. The predicted change of SOM 
isotopic signal would largely depend on the signal of the resistant fraction at 
the start of decomposition process if accounted for. It might be also argued 
that all initial SOM is in fact decomposable in long-term and the resistant SOM 
fraction, represented by microbial products, builds up during decomposition. If 
this was the case, the enrichment of SOM would be similar as predicted but it 
would take longer. We further assumed that no other process lead to isotopic 
discrimination. I opposite case, our predictions might be affected positively or 
negatively depending on the particular process, its rate and the connected 
discrimination. 
 However, four lines of evidence support our suggestion that IC 
incorporation can importantly contribute to 13C enrichment of soil OC. First , 
across all sites, inorganic 13C incorporation into OC, expressed on a total C 
basis, occurred throughout the soil profile and increased with soil depth. The 
isotopic signal of OC exponentially increased accordingly (R2 = 0.44, n = 149). 
Second , IC available in the soil profile is enriched relative to associated SOM 
and plant material. Soil CO 2 may be more enriched in 13C by up to 5 ‰ than 
SOM because of diffusion of lighter 12CO 2 out of the soil profile, leaving the 
heavier 13CO 2 behind (Cerling et al., 1991). Carbon dioxide dissolution (CO 2*) 
causes only negligible fractionation (around 1 ‰ ) and CO 2* entering 
carboxylation reactions should be enriched by 4 ‰ relative to the surrounding 
OC. Carbon dioxide  hydrogenation comes with a huge positive discrimination, 
and HCO 3- entering carboxylation reactions is enriched by 9 ‰ at 25  °C. The 
discrimination i ncreases with decreasing temperature to 12 ‰ at 0 °C 
(equilibrium fractionation factor; Mook et al., 1974). Thus, IC entering 
carboxylation as HCO 3- should be enriched relative to the surrounding organic 
material by 13 to 16 ‰ (4 ‰ plus 9 ‰ - 12 ‰)). Metha nogenesis in 
anaerobic microsites and deeper parts of the soil profile can cause further CO 2 
enrichment as methanogens strongly discriminate against heavier 13C 
139 
 (difference between CO 2 and CH 4 [CO2/CH4 ] from 5 ‰ to 93 ‰; Penger et al., 
2012), producing relatively light CH 4 and leaving behind much heavier CO 2 
(Han et al., 2007) . Third, genes for anaplerotic, assimilatory and biosynthetic 
carboxylase enzymes accounted for the major part of detected carboxylase 
genes. The majority of those enzymes accept HC O3- instead of CO 2 (Table SB1). 
Thus the initial reactant entering the carboxylation reaction is substantially 
enriched relative to SOM. Although HCO 3- entering carboxylation can originate 
from HCO 3- hydrated in soil solution (see above) or from CO 2* that is 
transported from soil solution into the cell, it will always be enriched relative 
to OC, as intracellular CO 2* hydration is catalysed by intracellular carbonic 
anhydrase which prefers 13C. The reaction causes an enrichment of HCO 3- by 7 
‰. Carbonic anhy drase is widespread among autotrophs but also among 
heterotrophic eukaryota and prokaryota (Merlin et al., 2003; Nafi et al., 1990; 
Smith and Ferry, 2000)  and is indispensable for the HCO 3- concentrating 
mechanism. If there were no CO 2 leak from cells, eve ry bicarbonate ion pulled 
into the cell should end up in organic compounds, and the isotopic signal of 
biomass would be determined by carbonic anhydrase fractionation (Hayes, 
1993). Even though there is always a leakage, cells utilizing bicarbonate should 
be enriched relative to CO 2 (Hayes, 1993) . It has been documented in plant 
cells that initial hydration of CO 2* to bicarbonate and subsequent PEP 
carboxylation causes enrichment of the resulting OC by 5.7 ‰ at 25 °C relative 
to gaseous CO 2. The enrichment is dependent on temperature and the amount 
of carbonic anhydrase present (Cousins et al., 2006; Farquhar, 1983) . Finally, 
while autotrophs mostly discriminate against heavier 13C and mean C 
discrimination of various autotrophic pathways ( IC/cell) ranges from zero to 
26.7 ‰ when measured in pure cultures (House et al. 2003 and reference 
therein), the cells utilizing HCO 3- will not always be depleted relative to CO 2 
due to fractionation in the hydration of CO 2 to HCO 3-. In addition, the 
discrimination can b e decreased by limited gas diffusion in water and the soil 
environment (Descolasgros and Fontugne, 1990)  and low cell density (House 
et al., 2003) . The autotrophs employing Rubisco, the most common autotrophic 
carboxylase accepting CO 2* and discriminating against 13CO 2 (-11 to -30 ‰; see 
Table SB1), should be depleted in 13C relative to soil CO 2. The proportion of 
autotrophs in bulk microbial biomass is, however, generally very low. In our 
experiment, genes encoding Rubisco represented at most 18 % of all 
carboxylase genes, implying that autotrophic prokaryotes should not 
140 
 determine the isotopic signal of total microbial biomass.  
 
5 Conclusion 
Our results demonstrate that dark CO 2 fixation is common in all arctic soils 
investigated and anaplerotic reactions are mainly responsible for this. Many 
anaplerotic pathways in heterotrophic CO 2 incorporation do not lead to any 
net C assimilation and biomass production (Alonso-Saez et al., 2010). Microbial 
biomass did not increase in soils without addition of bioavailable substrate 
either, which further suggests that dark IC fixation may only enable 
microorganisms to maintain metabolic activity even in C poor conditions. 
Inorganic C incorporation into OC only corresponds to a few percent of net soil 
respiration, but still it can play an important role in supporting microbial 
metabolism and organic matter transformation. We further demonstrate a 
positive impact of bioavailable soil organic compounds on inorganic C 
incorporation, implying that increases in plant litter decomposition induced by 
projected warming and input of root-derived compounds may also enhance C 
incorporation via dark C fixation.

Appendix A - model of microbial SOM decomposition 
Model structure 
A schematic representation of the model is given in Fig. 1 in the main text. 
Here, we specify details of the model. There are two carbon pools in the soil – 
soil organic matter (SOM) and soil microorganisms (Mic). At time zero, SOM 
and Mic are mainly composed of 12C (400 mg 12C and 4 mg 12C in SOM and Mic, 
respectively, per g soil). Both pools have δ13C -27 ‰, therefore the amounts of 
13C per g soil are 4.37 mg and 0.0437 mg for SOM and Mic, respectively. δ13C of 
each pool is changing as the decomposition process proceed. Over time, SOM 
and Mic change. SOM changes as a result of decomposition and microbial 
dying: 
147 
  
𝑑𝑆𝑂𝑀
𝑑𝑡= −𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 .      [1] 
 
Mic also changes as a result of decomposition and dying: 
 
𝑑𝑀𝑖𝑐
𝑑𝑡= 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 × 𝐶𝑈𝐸 − 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔.      [2] 
In eq. 2, CUE defines carbon use efficiency, i.e. the proportion of assimilated C 
in the overall consumed C. Its value is set to 0.55 (see below). Accordingly, 
respiration (CO 2 production) by the microbial community is: 
 
𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 × (1 − 𝐶𝑈𝐸 ).     [3] 
 
Decomposition follows first-order kinetics with the rate constant 𝑘 (d-1): 
 
𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑘 × 𝑆𝑂𝑀.        [4] 
 
Microbial dying also follows first-order kinetics, but with the rate constant 𝑑 
(d-1):  
 
𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 = 𝑑 × 𝑀𝑖𝑐.         [5] 
a) Isotopic signal 
In order to account for tentative changes in the isotopic signals of SOM and 
Mic, the fates of 12C and 13C in SOM and Mic are modelled separately. For SOM, 
the change in 12C is: 
 
𝑑𝑆𝑂𝑀 12𝐶
𝑑𝑡= −𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶+ 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 12𝐶,     [6] 
 
and the change in 13C is: 
 
𝑑𝑆𝑂𝑀 13𝐶
𝑑𝑡= −𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶+ 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 13𝐶.     [7] 
 
Accordingly, the changes in 12C and 13C in Mic are: 
 
𝑑𝑀𝐼𝐶 12𝐶
𝑑𝑡= 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶× 𝐶𝑈𝐸 − 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 12𝐶,    [8] 
 
𝑑𝑀𝑖𝑐 13𝐶
𝑑𝑡= 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶× 𝐶𝑈𝐸 − 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 13𝐶.    [9] 
 
148 
  
We assume that during decomposition and dying, no isotopic discrimination 
occurs. We use this simplification because the available literature is 
inconclusive in this sense (see the Discussion section in the main text). 
Therefore, 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶 and 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 13𝐶 are related to 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶 
and 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 12𝐶 according to the ratio of the lighter and heavier C isotopes in 
SOM and Mic, respectively: 
 
  𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶= 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶×𝑆𝑂𝑀 13𝐶
𝑆𝑂𝑀 12𝐶,   [10] 
  𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 13𝐶= 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 12𝐶×𝑀𝑖𝑐 13𝐶
𝑀𝑖𝑐 12𝐶.     [11] 
 
𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶 and 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 12𝐶 are modelled according to equations 4 and 5 
respectively.  
 
b) CO 2 fixation 
 
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that dark CO 2 fixation represents a 
constant part of net microbial respiration:  
f𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑎 × [𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶×(1 − 𝐶𝑈𝐸 )+ 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶×(1 − 𝐶𝑈𝐸 )].
         [12] 
The term in square brackets represents overall respiration and parameter 𝑎 
defines the ratio between fixation and respiration. It can theoretically range 
from 0 (no fixation) to 1 (all respired CO 2 is fixed). We modelled four scenarios 
with 𝑎 set to 0, 0.001, 0.01 or 0.05.  
 During CO 2 fixation, discrimination occurs because CO 2 is dissolved in soil 
solution first and then taken up by soil microorganisms. The amounts of 12CO 2 
and 13CO 2, respectively, fixed by soil microorganisms are modelled as: 
 
  𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶= 𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
1+𝐷𝑓,     [13] 
  𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶= 𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 × 𝐷𝑓
1+𝐷𝑓.     [14] 
 
In eqs. 13 and 14, 𝐷𝑓  is the discrimination term. It represents the proportion of 
13CO 2 in fixed CO 2. 𝐷𝑓 is defined to be consistent with the terminology used 
across isotopic studies:   
149 
  
  𝐷𝑓 = (𝛿13𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝 − ∆
(∆+1 ) ×1000+ 1) × 𝑃𝐷𝐵 .    [15] 
 
𝛿13𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝 is the isotopic signature of respired CO 2 that becomes dissolved and is 
consumed by soil microorganisms. ∆ is the isotope discrimination factor. For 
CO 2 fixation, its value is set to 4 ‰. 𝑃𝐷𝐵  stands for the isotopic signature of 
pee dee belemnite.  
 Accounting for CO 2 fixation, eqs. 8 and 9 can be rearranged to: 
 
𝑑𝑀𝐼𝐶 12𝐶
𝑑𝑡= 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶× 𝐶𝑈𝐸 − 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 12𝐶+ 𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶,  [16] 
 
𝑑𝑀𝑖𝑐 13𝐶
𝑑𝑡= 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶× 𝐶𝑈𝐸 − 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 13𝐶+ 𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶.  [17] 
 
Because fixed CO 2 is enriched in the heavier isotope, Mic becomes enriched 
over time. When microbes die, they become part of SOM and SOM becomes 
enriched too.  
 During decomposition, SOM decreases and the abundance of microbial 
products within SOM increase. We assume that SOM is not well mixed and 
therefore the probabilities that soil microorganisms consume SOM with an 
isotopic signature of - 27 ‰ or enriched microbial products depend on their 
abundance. Microbial products accumulate within SOM as microbial biomass is 
dying: 
 
 𝑑𝑀𝐼𝐶 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠
𝑑𝑡= 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 12𝐶+ 𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 13𝐶.     [18] 
 
The higher is the proportion of microbial products within SOM, the higher the 
probability that they decompose and are consumed by soil microorganisms. 
Therefore, the isotopic signature of decomposition flux changes with time: 
 
𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 13𝐶= 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 12𝐶× (𝑆𝑂𝑀 13𝐶−𝑡0
𝑆𝑂𝑀 12𝐶−𝑡0× 𝑓 𝑆𝑂𝑀 + 𝑆𝑂𝑀 13𝐶−𝑡
𝑆𝑂𝑀 12𝐶−𝑡× 𝑓 𝑀𝐼𝐶 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠)
        [19] 
 
𝑆𝑂𝑀 13𝐶−𝑡0
𝑆𝑂𝑀 12𝐶−𝑡0 is the isotopic signature of SOM at time 0 and 𝑆𝑂𝑀 13𝐶−𝑡
𝑆𝑂𝑀 12𝐶−𝑡 the isotopic 
signature of SOM at time t. SOM at time t includes some microbial products. 
150 
 The parameters 𝑓𝑆𝑂𝑀 and 𝑓𝑀𝐼𝐶 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠 define the abundances of original SOM 
and microbial products in the SOM pool at time t, respectively: 
 
 𝑓𝑆𝑂𝑀 =𝑆𝑂𝑀 𝑡
𝑆𝑂𝑀 𝑡+𝑀𝐼𝐶 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠−𝑡,      [20] 
 
 𝑓𝑀𝐼𝐶 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠=𝑀𝐼𝐶 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠−𝑡
𝑆𝑂𝑀 𝑡+𝑀𝐼𝐶 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠−𝑡,     [21] 
 
According to eq. 19, the isotopic signature of decomposition flux is close to -27 
‰ in the early stages of decomposition and then steadily increases as the 
enriched microbial products accumulate in SOM.  
 
Model parameterization 
There are three unknown parameters in our model – 𝑘, 𝑑 and 𝐶𝑈𝐸 . Parameter 
𝑘 was experimentally estimated in a separate long-term incubation experiment 
(Gentsch et al., in prep). Its mean value for different topsoil organic horizons 
across the arctic tundra is 3.5 ×10-4 d-1. Parameters 𝑑 and 𝐶𝑈𝐸  were define d 
according to Allison and collective (2010). The value of parameter 𝑑 is 4.8 ×10-
3 d-1. Under steady-state conditions, it would correspond to the turnover time 
of microbial biomass, which is 208 days. This is a rather conservative estimate. 
According to Allison et al. (2010), 𝐶𝑈𝐸  changes with temperature. When the 
temperature increases, 𝐶𝑈𝐸  decreases, and vice versa. We assumed that SOM 
is decomposing only during the vegetative season, which in arctic tundra lasts 
approximately 90 days. The average temperature during that period is 
approximately 5 °C. At that temperature, 𝐶𝑈𝐸  should be 0.55 (Allison et al., 
2010) . The model was run with these parameter values in daily steps for 1000 
years (90 000 days).  
 
Model results 
According to our model, SOM exponentially decreases over time, in accordance 
with what is usually observed when there is no SOM input. 
151 
  
Fig. SA1.  Modelled change of SOM over time. The solid grey line represents control (0 
% - no fixation), dashed, dotted and solid black lines represent CO 2 fixation rates equal 
to 0.1, 1 and 5 % of respiration rate, respectively. 
 
At the same time, Mic decreases accordingly. The proportion between SOM and 
Mic steadily increases with time and equilibrates after the first 10 years. When 
no fixation occurs, microbial biomass makes up 4.2 % of SOM. This is a 
somewhat higher number than is usually observed. The proportion of 
microbial biomass increases up to 4.4 % of SOM when fixation occurs at 5 % 
fixation rate.   
The isotopic signatures of SOM and Mic increase over time when 
fixation occurs. As expected, the change in isotopic signature of Mic is faster 
than in SOM.

respectively.

rate, respectively.

1 and 5 % of respiration rate, respectively.  
 
 
Fig. SA5.  The relationship between concentration of SOM and SOM isotopic signature. 
Open circles show measured data and lines model predictions. The solid grey line 
represents control (0 % - no fixation), dashed, dotted and solid black lines represent 
CO 2 fixation rates equal to 0.1, 1 and 5 % of respiration rate, respectively.  Please note 
that x -axis is in logarithmic scale.  
154 
  
After 1,000 years, the isotopic signature of SOM changes from - 27 ‰ to -26.69, 
-24.03 and - 15.17 ‰ at CO 2 fixation rates of 0.1, 1 and 5% of respiration, 
respectively. As SOM decreases over time, its isotopic signature increases. This 
leads to a relationship between SOM concentration and its isotopic signature 
that is similar to the one we observed in our measurements.   
 Because CO 2 fixation reduces the amount of CO 2 released to the 
atmosphere, there is a net difference in SOM between the control and soils 
where CO 2 fixation has occurred. The difference steadily increases until it 
reaches maximum. The maximum depends on fixation rate, at 5% fixation rate, 
the net difference in SOM pool makes 7.4 mg carbon per gram of dry soil, which 
is equivalent to 1.8% of initial SOM pool. After reaching maximum, the net 
difference decreases as the SOM pool becomes depleted. After 1000 years, the 
difference in SOM pool between the control and soils where CO 2 fixation has 
occurred is almost non-existing.

and soils with occurrence of heterotrophic CO 2 fixation over time. The solid grey line

CO 2 fixation rates equal to 0.1, 1 and 5 % of respiration rate, respectively.

Summary
1.Nutrient limitation of soil microbial communities controls the rates of plant litter and soil
organic matter decomposition and nutrient mineralization, and as such, it is central to soil and
ecosystem models.
2.According to ecological stoichiometry theory, when the carbon (C)-to-nutrient (E) ratio of
resources used by a microbial community is higher than a critical ratio (C : E CR), that nutrient
is limiting. The C-to-phosphorus (P) critical ratio (C : P CR) that determines P limitation is
largely unknown for soils, and thus, it is the subject of our study.
3.Our results show that the C : P CRin widely diﬀerent soils ranges from 26 /C16 to 465 /C11 or from
20/C19 to 740 /C17 when accounting for 95% conﬁdence intervals. Using constant or narrowly
ﬂuctuating C : P CRin ecosystem models is therefore inaccurate.
4.The C : P CRcannot be simply predicted from microbial community C : P or available soil
P. C : P CRwas only related to relative abundance of phospholipid fatty acids, which reﬂects
microbial community structure and physiology. Our data suggest complex controls overmicrobial community C : P
CR.
5.We further propose that using P storage compounds that allow the microbial community to
temporarily buﬀer variability in available P can represent a widely adopted strategies acrosssoils.

Introduction
Since the 1990s, important ecosystem processes, such as
plant litter and soil organic matter decomposition and
nutrient mineralization, became widely framed in ecologi-
cal stoichiometry theory (Enriquez, Duarte & Sandjensen1993; Sterner & Elser 2002; Manzoni & Porporato 2009;Hall et al. 2010). One central paradigm of ecological stoi-
chiometry is the constant or narrowly ﬂuctuating (homeo-static) stoichiometry of three macronutrients in livingorganisms [carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P),thereafter expressed on a molar basis]. In the soil, the
degree of the microbial homeostasis is supposed to be
strong (Makino et al. 2003; Cleveland & Liptzin 2007) and
the variability in bulk microbial community stoichiometryis low (6 /C13<C:N <8/C13, 31 /C16<C:P <130/C17; Xu,
Thornton & Post 2013). Comparing to soil microbialcommunities, plants are less homeostatic (Elser et al. 2010)
and therefore plant litter stoichiometry displays muchhigher variability (5 <C:N <100, 250 <C : P, 3500;
Elser et al. 2010), primarily reﬂecting diﬀerences among
plant organs (e.g. leaves are richer in P than wood), as wellas species composition and stand conditions. The stoi-chiometry of soil organic matter also varies greatly(10/C15<C:N <31/C14, 6/C16<C:P< 1347/C10; Xu, Thornton
& Post 2013), depending on plant litter input, edaphic con-ditions, geology, microbial transformations, etc. Thus, thevariable stoichiometry of plant litter and to a lesser degreeof soil organic matter often does not meet the nutritional
requirements of homeostatic microbial communities and
causes nutrient limitation of microbial growth. In turn,nutrient limitation may slow down the rate of plant litterdecomposition and decrease nutrient mineralization rate(Enriquez, Duarte & Sandjensen 1993; Schade et al. 2005;
Manzoni & Porporato 2009). Therefore, with abiotic fac-tors and C availability, nutrient limitation is considered an

165important factor controlling growth of soil microbial com-
munities and ultimately the above-mentioned ecosystemprocesses (Brown et al. 2004; Cross et al. 2015).
Under controlled conditions, microbial growth is a non-
linear function of available substrate, usually modelled by
Monod equation (Sinsabaugh, Shah & Follstad Shah
2012). This equation is hyperbolic; that is, it has saturating
character and thus reﬂects substrate-saturated growth at
high substrate concentration and substrate limited growthat low substrate concentration. Substrates are complex
mixtures of compounds including C, N and P and other
nutrients including micronutrients. When one of thesenutrients is in shortage with respect to the others and in
relation to the decomposer nutritional requirements,
microbial growth becomes limited by that nutrient and fol-
lows the linear part of the Monod equation (Schmidt 1992;
Boer et al. 2009).
To determine the most limiting nutrients, which ulti-
mately drive microbial growth rate, the principle of criticalratio was formulated –growth-limiting nutrients are those
whose C-to-nutrient ratio is higher than the critical ratio.
This concept has a simple mathematical origin (Bosatta &
Berendse 1984; /C23Agren & Bosatta 1998; Sinsabaugh et al.
2013): it is the ratio at which the maximum rate of supply
of a given nutrient is equal to the nutrient demand. For
phosphorus, all P is supplied by an inorganic P poolbecause mineralization is extracellular process ensured by
phosphatases (McGill & Cole 1981). It can be shown (see
Appendix S1, Supporting information) that in this case the
critical ratio of organic C-to-inorganic P can be approxi-
mated as,
ðC:PÞ
CR¼kI
kDðC:PÞm
CUEeqn 1
where kIandkDare kinetic constants for inorganic P and
organic C uptake, respectively, (C : P) mis the microbial
community C : P ratio, and CUE is the carbon use eﬃ-
ciency. When the C : P ratio of the resource is lower than
C:P CR, P is in excess of demand and is mineralized;
otherwise, the rates of P immobilization and microbial
growth become limited by inorganic P. The origin ofC:P
CRas the breakpoint between C-limited and P-limited
regimes is illustrated in Fig. 1a (dots). Figure 1b showshow C : P
CRvaries as a function of the key stoichiometric
traits (C : P) m(on the abscissa) and CUE (higher for the
black curves), and the ratio of kItokD, which indicates
how eﬀectively the microbial community takes up inor-ganic P vs. organic C.
Empirical studies estimated the C : N ratio above which
microbes require net N immobilization. For terrestrialmicrobial communities, this threshold varies within /C2520
and 200 ( /C23Agren et al. 2013; Zechmeister-Boltenstern et al.
2015), with higher values in N-poor litter and woody resi-
dues (Moore et al. 2006; Manzoni et al. 2010). These
results suggest that microbial community C : N ratio and/or CUE might adapt to the available substrates. However,
the critical C : P ratio has not been estimated for soils yet,and thus, it is diﬃcult to recognize when P limitation
occurs and whether microbial communities can adapt to
contrasting stoichiometric conditions.
It could be argued that the ﬂexibility of critical ratios
reﬂects an underlying strategy adopted by soil microbialcommunities to cope with the large variability of plant lit-ter and soil organic matter stoichiometry and thus avoidnutrient limitation. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect
that the C : P
CRincreases with declining P availability, if
microbial communities adapt their stoichiometric traits to
alleviate P limitation. However, it could be also arguedthat the microbial community adapts to abiotic factors
other than P limitation and thus their stoichiometric traits
do not primarily reﬂect P limitation. In this case, theC:P
CRwould not increase with declining P availability
and strong eﬀects of environmental and edaphic conditions
could be expected.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the

approach to calculate the C : P CR, and then, we assess its
variability among 18 soils from a variety of geographicareas and ecosystems and sampled at diﬀerent depths. Weexpect the C : P
CRto vary widely among soils and gener-
ally increase in P-poor soils as a result of microbial com-munity adaptation to P limitation. Microbial communitycan adapt by change in species composition [change ofcommunity level (C : P)
m] or physiology (change of CUE
orkI/kD). We further expect a direct link between C : P CR
and (C : P) mas result of prior community-level (C : P) m
adaptation to P limitation.
Materials and methods
EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP
Soil samples collected from diverse localities and ecosystems
were used in the experiment. Basic site and soil characteristicsare given in Table S1; detailed methods are described inAppendix S2.
Soils were sieved on 3-mm mesh and stored wet at 4 °Ci n
dark until start of the incubation. Before incubation, soils wereconditioned for 1 week at 20 °C in the dark. Soils were then
mixed with sterile C-free silica sand (sterilized by heating:
550°C for 5 h) with grains <2 mm (25 : 1, w/w; sand : soil) to
minimize the background eﬀect of the original soil organic C
and nutrients. All organic C and nutrients were supplied to themixture in basal medium. The mixture was moistened to 75%
water holding capacity by supplying basal medium (8 g of
sucrose, 0 /C11 g of yeast extract, 0 /C12 g of MgSO
4.7H 2O, 0/C102 g of
FeSO 4,1 go fN H 4Cl, 0/C102 g of CaCl in 500 mL of deionized
H2O; Veldkamp 1970). The amount of basal medium added was
1 mL to 5.2 g of the mixture and the medium concentrationwas appropriately manipulated to reach the concentration20 mol of organic C per mol of soil microbial biomass C in all
soils. N and other nutrients except for P were in excess. P was
supplied in the form of K
2HPO 4to achieve concentrations from
0 to 5 g P per litre (11 concentration levels for each soil). Sam-ples were incubated in 100 mL vials with oxitop heads on top
(WTW Wissenschaftlich-Technische Werkst €atten GmbH, Weil-
heim, Germany) for 7 days in the dark at 20 °C in three repli-
cates for each treatment. Oxitop system was set to measure
oxygen consumption continuously every 30 min during the
whole incubation period.
The microbial growth rate was calculated from oxygen con-
sumption. The slope of increase of O
2consumption is directly
related to microbial community growth rate (Hill & Robinson1974). For data ﬁtting, the
Rpackage GROFIT was employed
(Fig. S1; Kahm et al. 2010; R Core Team 2014). When the slope
of increase was statistically undistinguishable from 0, the micro-
bial community was considered not growing.
MICROBIAL AND SOIL ANALYSIS
Microbial C (Vance, Brookes & Jenkinson 1987), N (Brookeset al. 1985) and P (Brookes, Powlson & Jenkinson 1982) were
measured in 3 replicates in all soils by the chloroform fumigation
extraction method before the start of the incubation. Soil available
C, N and P were measured simultaneously with microbial C, N
and P as 0 /C15
MK2SO4extractable C and N and 0 /C15MNaHCO 3
(pH=8/C15) extractable P. Details on the method are given in
Appendix S2.PHOSPHOLIPID FATTY ACID IDENTIFICATION AND
QUANTIFICATION
The determination of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) was
done in 6 representative soils with the low [Siberia (Ajj) and(BCg)], intermediate [Plesne, Certovo, Siberia (O)] and high(Pop Ivan) C : P
CR(see Appendix S2) according to Froste-
gard, Baath & Tunlid (1993), with minor modiﬁcations. Soilswere analysed in three replicates at two diﬀerent stages ofsample processing: (i) after a pre-incubation period before
mixing with the sand and (ii) after 40 h of soil/sand mixture
incubation (at the time of exponential growth of the microbialcommunity). The analysis was done at the P supply value cor-responding to incipient P limitation (i.e. at the critical C : P
ratio, see Mathematical description). Such sampling design
was chosen in order to answer two questions: (i) Does soilmanipulation aﬀect soil microbial community structure? (ii)What is the structure of growing microbial community at the
critical C-to-P ratio? Details on the method are given in
Appendix S2.
MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION
The response of microbial community growth rate to theamount of available P in the soil/sand mixture (for moredetails see Appendix S2) was described by a modiﬁed Monod
equation,
l¼VMAXP
KMþPþl0 eqn 2
where lis the biomass-speciﬁc growth rate of the bulk
microbial community (h/C01; see also Appendix S2), Pis the total
amount of available phosphorus in the soil/sand mixture(lmol), K
Mis the half saturation constant, and VMAX is the
maximum growth rate. In contrast to the classic Monod equa-
tion, equation (2) has an additional parameter l0that repre-
sents the growth rate at zero P supply in the basal medium and
shifts the curve along the y-axis (Fig. S2). When l0is positive,
the soil microbial community is able to temporarily grow with-
out P supply, but solely relying on its own P storage com-pounds –as commonly observed among microbial species
(Kulaev, Vagabov & Kulakovskaya 1999; Cotner, Makino &Biddanda 2006; Nikel et al. 2013, see below). Negative values
mean instead that microbes cannot grow without external Psupply and only respire. They do not grow until certain amount
of P is provided. The sum of l
0and VMAX deﬁnes the asymp-
totic or maximum growth rate attainable by a microbial com-
munity at deﬁned substrate-saturated conditions.
Equation (2) predicts a steep increase of growth rate with
increasing amount of P followed by a slower approach to theasymptotic value (Fig. S2). These two ‘stages’ of growth rateresponse to P amount can be mathematically separated at a criti-
cal amount of P, at which the growth rate increase slows down.
To calculate this critical Pamount ( P
CR), ﬁrst the fraction of the
asymptotic growth rate after all P storage has been consumed ( R)
is deﬁned based on equation (2),
R¼l/C0l0
VMAXeqn 3
Combining equations (2) and (3) allows us rewriting Ras a
function of KMand the Pamount:

167The critical value of Pamount, PCR, is chosen so that R=¾
(three-quarters of asymptotic growth rate), corresponding to the
point where the sensitivity of lto P availability starts decreasing.
This is the point that most closely resembles the theoretical criti-cal ratio when C and P limitation switch as described inAppendix S1. Rearranging equation (3), we obtain P
CRas a
function of KM,
PCR¼3/C2KM eqn 5
As nitrogen and other nutrients in the growth medium were in
excess, the calculated PCRis not aﬀected by other nutrient limita-
tions. Finally, the critical C : P ratio was calculated as the ratio of
available organic C in the growth medium and PCR.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The relationship between microbial community stoichiometry
and soil stoichiometry was tested using simple linear regression.
To evaluate microbial community growth rate response to
phosphorus availability, the modiﬁed Monod equation was ﬁt-
ted and equation parameters were estimated (with 95% conﬁ-dence intervals) using nonlinear least square regression for eachsoil separately. Nonlinear mixed-eﬀect models (using
Rpackage
NLME ; Pinhero et al. 2015) were used for further statistical eval-
uation. First, the null model was deﬁned as nonlinear functionof P availability according to modiﬁed Monod equation. Equa-tion parameters were allowed to randomly vary across samples.
Secondly, the null model was improved by forward selection of
the best equation parameters predictors. The best predictors
were chosen from all ancillary data we obtained. These
included microbial and soil C, N, P, microbial and soil stoi-
chiometric ratios (C : N, C : P, N : P), pH, mean annual tem-perature and precipitation, latitude, altitude, sampling depth,
ecosystem type, land management and microbial community
structure.
Because the characterization of the microbial community
structure by relative abundance of PLFA markers in the sam-
ple lead to an extensive data set, this information was col-
lapsed into vectors using principal components analysis
(PCA). We retained the ﬁrst three principal components andused scores for each soil on these axes as predictor variablesin the nonlinear mixed-eﬀect model. Before PCA analysis,
data were normalized. Permutational multivariate analysis of
variance (using
Rpackage VEGAN ;O k s a n e n et al. 2015) was
further used to check the diﬀerence between microbial com-
munity structure of each soil before and after manipulation.
All statistical analyses were done using the statistical program
R(R Core Team 2014).
Results
SOIL AND MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STOICHIOMETRY
The C : N ratio of the soil microbial communities from
our 18 samples was between 5 /C15t o3 4 /C16 (Table S1). The
(C : P) mranged from 24 /C17 to 346 /C16 (Table S1). The stoi-
chiometric ratios of available nutrients were more vari-
able spanning more than one order in magnitude (C : N
from 1 /C10t o2 9 /C15; C : P from 22 /C18 to 788 /C17, Table S1).
There was no linear relationship between soil and micro-bial stoichiometry (C : N and C : P, Fig. S3), and the
slopes of both relationships were statistically undistin-
guishable from 0.MICROBIAL COMMUNITY GROWTH RATE RESPONSE TO
PHOSPHORUS
All microbial communities showed a clear trend of increas-
ing microbial community growth rate with increasing
amount of available P according to the modiﬁed Monod
equation (Fig. 2), but parameters were distinctly diﬀerent
among soils (Table S2). Variations of the equation parame-
ters from their mean values are interpreted as indicators of
diﬀerences among soils. The highest variability occurred inthel
0parameter (mean value 0 /C153, coeﬃcient of variation
CV=187%) and KMparameter, which deﬁnes PCR,
showed second highest variability (mean value 1 /C159,
CV=56%). PCRfor individual soils varied from 1 /C129 to
20/C155lmol (Table S2), resulting in a range of more than
one order in magnitude for the critical C : P ratio (Fig. 3;
26/C16–465/C11). Accounting for uncertainty in KMestimates
using 95% conﬁdence intervals, the range of C : P CR
increased (Fig. 3; 20 /C19–740/C17).
MODIFIED MONOD EQUATION PARAMETERS
After quantifying the variability of the parameters in the
modiﬁed Monod equation, we continued with the null
regression model build up (Fig. 2).
l0parameter
Growth rate at zero P concentration in the soil, l0, was
inversely and signiﬁcantly correlated with microbial C : P
at the beginning of the incubation (Fig. 4a), except for
deep soil horizons. This linear relationship was signiﬁcant
only for the topsoil horizons ( F=31/C16, d.f. =1,
P<0/C1001); therefore, it did not lead to signiﬁcant
improvement of the whole nonlinear mixed-eﬀect model(LR=4/C116, d.f. =12,P=0/C1125) as deep soil horizons fell
out of the linear relationship.
Asymptotic growth rate
We found a signiﬁcant linear relationship between micro-
bial C : N and asymptotic growth rate (Fig. 4b, F= 8/C18,
d.f.=1,P=0/C1009). The lower was microbial C : N, and
the higher was the asymptotic growth rate. Incorporation
of this linear relationship into the mixed-eﬀect model
improved the model at 10% level of signiﬁcance(LR=2/C184, d.f. =13,P=0/C1092).
K
Mparameter
The half saturation constant, KM, was driven by microbial
community structure of the soil, as assessed by PLFA
analysis on 6 representative soil samples. Microbial com-
munity structure explained most of the variability in KM
(78%; Fig. 5). The relationship between microbial speciescomposition and K
Mwas signiﬁcant ( F=21/C12, d.f. =1,
P<0/C1001) and led to signiﬁcant improvement of the non-

168linear mixed-eﬀect model (LR =12/C12, d.f. =14,
P=0/C1015).
MICROBIAL PLFA COMPOSITION
Soil manipulation and incubation signiﬁcantly aﬀected
microbial community structure of the original soil
(Fig. S4; pseudo F =194/C19, d.f. =1,P<0/C1001). Microbial
community structure of all soils from spruce forest ecosys-tems (Certovo, Plesne and Pop Ivan), even though geo-
graphically distant, changed in the same way (Fig S4). Thesame was true for Siberia(Ajj) and Siberia(BCg) soil sam-ples, which are next to each other in the soil proﬁle. Inspruce forest ecosystem soils, the shift of microbial com-munity structure was mainly characterized by an increaseof relative abundance of two fungal markers (18:1n9,
18:2n6,9) and parallel decrease of G+ and G/C0 bacteria-
speciﬁc markers (a15:0, 16:1n7, cy17 and 18:1n7; Fig. S4).μμ−

ria-speciﬁc markers (cy19:0 and i16:0) decreased in both
Siberian samples as well as actinobacterial and general
bacterial markers (10Me16:0 and i15:0). Therefore, thesimple measure fungi to bacteria ratio could not character-
ize the shift of microbial community structure after incu-
bation and thus was a poor predictor of K
M.
Discussion
MODIFIED MONOD EQUATION PARAMETERS
l0parameter
Among our soil samples, some had extremely low micro-bial community C : P, around or below 30 (Plesne, Stra-
san, Tarvisio). Those values are lower than the global
average, which is according to diﬀerent studies around 60(Cleveland & Liptzin 2007), 88 (Mouginot et al. 2014) or
42 (Xu, Thornton & Post 2013). The high concentration ofP in microbial cells relative to C can be reached either byincrease of ribosomes in the cell (Sterner & Elser 2002;
Elser et al. 2003) or by accumulation of P storage
compounds, mainly polyphosphates (Kulaev, Vagabov &Kulakovskaya 1999; Cotner, Makino & Biddanda 2006;
Nikel et al. 2013). While ribosomes can make up to 1 /C15%
of cell dry weight (Elser et al. 2003), polyphosphates can
make as much as 30% of cell dry weight (Kulaev, Vagabov& Kulakovskaya 1999) and thus might be responsible for
observed variation in cellular P concentrations. Polyphos-
phates serve the microbes as an internal P source when
external sources are scarce (Kulaev, Vagabov & Kulakovs-
kaya 1999). The negative linear relationship we foundμ −(a)

170between microbial community C : P and growth rate at
zero P supply ( l0) across all topsoil horizons (Fig. 4a) con-
ﬁrms this view. It suggests that P reserves stored aspolyphosphates were utilized to allow growth of the micro-bial community in presence of abundant C, but at zero P
supply. It might be argued that residual soil P could have
also been used by the microbial community at zero P inthe basal medium. However, we found no relationshipbetween l
0and soil P. Moreover, the dilution rate of our
soils by a sterilized sand was high enough to reduce theamount of residual soil P (see Appendix S2).
While the trend of decreasing l
0with increasing micro-
bial C : P was strong across all surface soils, the deep soil
horizons behaved diﬀerently. These soils were character-
ized by extremely high microbial community C : P ratios,almost two to four times higher than global average(Cleveland & Liptzin 2007; Xu, Thornton & Post 2013;Mouginot et al. 2014). However, the same communities also
exhibited high l
0[especially Siberia(Ajj) –C:P= 150/C15,
l0=2/C109; Siberia(BCg), C : P =346/C16,l0=1/C192]. The two
most extremes –the Siberian deep soil horizons –were taken
from depths of 50 and 70 cm, respectively. We suggest thatthe reason why deep soil horizon falls out of the linear rela-tionship is the high abundance of dormant microbial cells intheir microbial community, which decouple microbial com-munity C : P and l
0:
1.It is documented that the microbial community of deepsoil horizons is characterized by high abundance of dor-mant cells (up to 98%; Blagodatskaya & Kuzyakov
2013), and thus, it is expected that community C : P
reﬂects the C : P of dormant cells. Microbial dormancyis accompanied by unique physiological changes (Her-bert 1961; Oliver 1993; Lennon & Jones 2011) thatincrease cell C : P (Linder & Oliver 1989; Kieft et al.
1997; Wang & Bakken 1998; Sterner & Elser 2002;Kadouri et al. 2005). Assuming that the C : P of dor-
mant cells is near the highest known level (409; Cleveland
& Liptzin 2007), we can infer that the proportion of dor-mant cells needed to compensate the C : P of active cells[27/C12a n d2 8 /C17 for Siberia(Ajj) and Siberia(BCg) soils,
respectively, using surface values] has to be 87 /C16% and
96/C15% for Siberia(Ajj) and Siberia(BCg) soil, respectively.
Such an amount of dormant microbial cells in deep soilhorizons is realistic and comparable to previous estimates(Blagodatskaya & Kuzyakov 2013). Thus, we surmise
that the linear relationship between microbial C : P and
l
0is generally valid for active microbial cells, which can
store and use polyphosphates.
2.Dormant cells cannot start their reactivation and growunless carbon and nutrients became available (Blago-datskaya & Kuzyakov 2013). At zero P amount, the onlymicrobial cells that can grow are the already active oneswith low C : P (dormant cells with high C : P cannot
grow). However, at higher P amounts (and also around
the critical P amount), the dormant cells reactivateand thus the growth response to P amount can beexplained by the characteristics of the whole community.These hypothesized mechanisms appear to explain the
deviation of deep soil horizons from the behaviour of thetop soils, but more data would be needed to properly testthe mechanism.
Asymptotic growth rate
According to the modiﬁed Monod equation, the asymp-
totic growth rate is the maximum growth that the micro-bial community can reach under substrate-saturatedconditions. This value was negatively related to microbialcommunity C : N (Fig. 4b), in accordance with empiricalevidence (Mouginot et al. 2014) and the theoretical predic-
tions of Vrede et al. (2004), who showed that the maxi-
mum attainable growth rate increases with increasing totalamount of catalytic macromolecules in the cell (mainlyrRNA, see above) or with increasing ribosome-speciﬁcprotein synthesis rate. The amount of catalytic macro-molecules change cellular C : N or C : P, because they areN and P rich (Elser et al. 2003; Vrede et al. 2004). The
higher the amount of catalytic macromolecules, the lower
the cellular C : N and C : P, thus explaining the negative
relationship between maximum attainable growth rate andcellular C : N or C : P. In our experiment, the relationshipbetween asymptotic growth rate and microbial communityC : N was statistically signiﬁcant, but that was not thecase for (C : P)
m. As we discussed above, microbial com-
munity C : P was aﬀected by P storage compounds morethan by the amount of catalytic macromolecules and thus
the relationship was not found. There was also some resid-
ual variability in the negative linear relationship betweenasymptotic growth rate and microbial community C : N,possibly caused by diﬀerent ribosome-speciﬁc protein syn-thesis rate, which is species speciﬁc (Vrede et al. 2004).
K
Mparameter
The half saturation constant ( KM) was the most important
parameter of the modiﬁed Monod equation, because itwas shown to be proportional to the critical P amount,which in turn determines C : P critical (C : P
CR). In 6 rep-
resentative soils, whose C : P CRrange from 26/C1 6 to 227 /C12,
nearly 80% of the variability in KMcould be explained by
the ﬁrst three principal components of the PLFA proﬁles(Fig. 5). The ﬁrst principal component, which accounts
for the most explained variability (66%), was negatively
correlated with fungal-speciﬁc markers (18:2n6,9, 18:1n9)and positively correlated with four G+ or G/C0 bacteria-
speciﬁc markers (a15:0, 16:1n7, cy17 and 18:1n7). The ﬁrstprincipal component mainly separated spruce forestecosystem soils (Certovo, Plesne and Pop Ivan) withC:P
CRaround or above 100, from Siberia(Ajj) and
Siberia(BCg) soils with C : P CRbelow 30 (Fig. 5a). In this
respect, our ﬁndings are partly in agreement with the gen-eral theory (eqn 1), which predicts higher C : P
CRof fungi
compared to bacteria because of higher fungal C : P andtherefore lower demand for P (Cleveland & Liptzin 2007;
©2016 The Authors. Functional Ecology ©2016 British Ecological Society, Functional Ecology ,30, 1705–1713The carbon-to-phosphorus critical ratio 1711
171Mouginot et al. 2014). Nevertheless, we have no direct evi-
dence to support a general relationship between cellular
C : P and C : P CR(Fig. S5a). This is in disagreement with
our initial hypothesis. There was also no relationshipbetween soil P and C : P
CR(Fig. S5b). We argue that
(C : P) m, soil P and C : P CRare not necessarily connected,
because each of them could be independently and diﬀer-
ently aﬀected by edaphic conditions.
1.Microbial community C :P does not reﬂect demands of
growing cells for P and thus it is not related to C :PCR.
As we showed above, the concentration of P in micro-bial cells is modiﬁed by P storage compounds and it isalso very likely aﬀected by the microbial physiological
status (active/dormant). Both formation of P storage
compounds and dormant structures is not directly con-
nected to growth. Therefore, across these widely diﬀer-
ent soils, the microbial community C : P ratio per se
cannot be directly related to C : P
CR.
2.C:PCRis not related to available soil P because microbial
communities do not adapt to avoid P limitation. Usually, P
availability is not the main driver of microbial commu-
nity adaptation. One of the most important drivers is
depth because temperature, substrate concentration,moisture, texture, etc. change along with increasing depth
(e.g. Gittel et al. 2014b; Schnecker et al. 2014). Very
often, P availability decreases with increasing depth (Kal-
cik & Santruckova 1994), which was also the case for
soils from Siberia, Skogaby and Str /C23asan (Table S1). With
decreasing P availability along increasing depth, C : P
CR
decrease in Siberian and Skogaby soils, in contrast with
our expectation. This unexpected trend could beexplained by the fact that abundance of fungi as well asfungi to bacteria ratio generally decrease with increasing
depth, independent of P availability (e.g. Gittel et al.
2014a,b). With increasing abundance of bacteria with low
C:Pr a t i o ,C:P
CRcan decrease with depth (eqn 1).
Our data show that no simple predictor of C : P CR
exists. C : P CRis very likely driven by many edaphic fac-
tors like substrate availability, P availability, pH, tempera-
ture, moisture, etc. and their mutual combinations. These
factors modify C : P CRvia their eﬀects on soil microbial
community structure and physiology (CUE and kI/kDin
eqn 1). The relative abundance of PLFA is a manifestation
of eﬀects of edaphic conditions on soil microbial commu-
nity structure, explaining why PLFA is the only signiﬁcantpredictor of K
Mand thus of C : P CR.
C : P CRITICAL IN ECOSYSTEM MODELS
We showed that C : P CRcould vary from 26 /C16 to 465 /C11.
Accounting for 95% conﬁdence interval of KMparameter
estimate, the limits of C : P CRare even wider –from 20 /C19
to 740 /C17. Using constant or narrowly ﬂuctuating C : P CR
in ecosystem models is therefore inaccurate. However,implementation of variable C : P
CRinto models can be
problematic at present, because no simple predictor ofC:P CRcould be found. C : P CRdoes not reﬂect ecosys-
tem type, biome, land management, microbial communityC : P or P availability, but is related to community struc-ture (Fig. 5). More data would be needed in future,especially from deep soil horizons, to develop the process-
based understanding of variations in C : P
CRrequired for
P cycle models.

Appendix S1 - Critical C to P ratio calculations 
In this Appendix we show how the critical C:P ratio, above which P limitation 
starts, can be linked to microbial traits, with a focus on the specific 
experimental setup presented here. 
 Let us consider an organic substrate with a given C:P ratio, (𝐶:𝑃)𝑠, a 
pool of bio -available inorganic P, 𝑃𝑖, and a microbial communit y with a 
chemical composition (𝐶:𝑃)𝑚 and a C -use efficiency 𝐶𝑈𝐸 . Because P 
mineralization takes place outside the microbial cells thanks to extracellular 
phosphatases (McGill & Cole 1981 ), no organic P can be directly assimilated, 
and all P from organic matter decomposition is transferred to 𝑃𝑖 before it is 
consumed by microbes. Therefore, the stoichiometric demand for inorganic P 
of a homeostatic microbial community is defined a s: 
𝛷𝑃= 𝐷𝐶𝑈𝐸
(𝐶:𝑃)𝑚,       [A1]  
where D is the C-limited organic matter decomposition rate (in C-flux units, 
e.g., mol C/kg soil/day) and the product 𝐷 × 𝐶𝑈𝐸  represents the microbial 
growth rate. For simplicity, the flux D is described by a multiplicative model 
(Manzoni & Porporato 2009 ), 
𝐷 = 𝑘 𝐷𝐶𝑠𝐶𝑚,       [A2]  
where 𝐶𝑠 and 𝐶𝑚 indicate the sizes of the substrate and microbial C pools, 
respectively, and 𝑘𝐷 is a kinetic constant.  
 The microbial P demand can be met by immobilization from 𝑃𝑖 if this pool 
is replenished by mineralization (at a rate 𝐷(𝐶: 𝑃 )𝑠 ⁄ ) or other amendments. 
When enough P can be supplied, immobilization from 𝑃𝐼 exactly matches the P 
demand and the microbial community grows at a C-limited rate 𝐷 × 𝐶𝑈𝐸 . In 
contrast, when the concentration of inorganic P is low, immobilization 
becomes a function of 𝑃𝑖 and the demand cannot be met, resulting in P-limited 
microbial growth. In this case, in analogy to Equation [A2], immobilization can 
be described by a multiplicative model of 𝑃𝑖 and 𝐶𝑚, with kinetic constant 𝑘𝐼. 
174These two regimes can be incorporated in a single equation for the P 
immobilization rate, 
𝐼𝑃=min [𝑘𝐼𝑃𝑖𝐶𝑚, 𝑘𝐷𝐶𝑠𝐶𝑚𝐶𝑈𝐸
(𝐶:𝑃)𝑚].    [A3]  
The first term in Equation [A3] represents the P immobilization rate when 
inorganic P is limiting, whereas the second term represents the stoichiometric 
P demand that guarantees a C-limited growth.  
The microbial growth rate per unit biomass can be obtained by 
converting the P flux in Equation [A3] to microbial C using (𝐶: 𝑃 )𝑚, and 
dividing by 𝐶𝑚, 
𝜇 = min [𝑘𝐼𝑃𝑖(𝐶: 𝑃 )𝑚, 𝑘𝐷𝐶𝑠 𝐶𝑈𝐸 ].    [A4]  
According to Equation [A4], the growth rate first increases linearly with 𝑃𝑖 (P-
limited regime) and then transitions to a constant value that only depends on 
organic C availability and 𝐶𝑈𝐸  (C-limited regime). The growth rate normalize d 
by the rate of uptake of C substrates is shown in Figure 1A (main text), as a 
function of the ratio 𝐶𝑠𝑃𝑖⁄. Mathematically, this normalized growth rate is 
given by the function min [𝑘𝐼
𝑘𝐷𝑃𝑖
𝐶𝑠(𝐶: 𝑃 )𝑚, 𝐶𝑈𝐸 ], where the C-limited regime is 
characterized by the constant 𝐶𝑈𝐸  and the P-limited regime is an inverse 
function of 𝐶𝑠𝑃𝑖⁄. 
 The 𝐶𝑠𝑃𝑖⁄ ratio at which the two terms of Equation [A4] are equal defines 
the transition point from C- to P-limitation (Equation [1] and dots in Figure 1 
in the main text), 
𝐶𝑠
𝑃𝑖=𝑘𝐼
𝑘𝐷(𝐶:𝑃)𝑚
𝐶𝑈𝐸.       [A5]  
Despite the simplifications, Equation [A4] is conceptually comparable with the 
measured microbial growth- 𝑃𝑖 curves (Section “Mathematical Description” in 
the main text) and can thus be used to interpret them. In the proposed 
experiment, 𝐶𝑠 is set by providing abundant labile C to the medium, whereas 𝑃𝑖 
is varied (i.e., all inorganic P is supplied externally and not through organic 
substrates), and microbial growth curves as a function of 𝑃𝑖 are obtained. The 
critical 𝐶𝑠𝑃𝑖⁄ is estimated at the transition between the near-linear behavior 
175and the asymptotic growth rate value, and is thus conceptually equivalent to 
Equation [4]. Therefore, even if the parameters 𝑘𝐷 and 𝑘𝐼 cannot be estimated 
with this method, Equation [1] provides a useful conceptual model to generate 
hypotheses to explain patterns in the measured critical 𝐶𝑠𝑃𝑖⁄ ratios.

Appendix S2 - Experimental settings, Materials and Methods 
In appendix 2 we include details about experimental design and explain units 
used in the main text. We also append Supporting figures that illustrate our 
complete dataset. 
 
Soil samples  
Soils samples used in our study represent a wide range of environmental 
conditions including extreme ones in terms of climate and land management. 
Here we include detailed description of sampling sites and horizons. Sampling 
sites Tsomoriri and Marka are located in Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir State, 
India. The area is a part of the Trans-Himalaya, being delimited by the Eastern 
Karakoram Range in the north and by the Great Himalaya Range in the south. 
The sites are extremely arid due to its position in the rain-shadow of the 
Himalaya Range (average annual precipitation100 mm). Because of their high 
elevation (5200 and 5300 m a.s.l. for Marka and Tsomoriri respectively), 
almost no vegetation is present (Dvorsky et al.  2013)  and the soil microbial 
community is only present in biological soil crusts (Bowker et al.  2014). 
 The soil Ajj horizon sample from the Turbic Cryosol (Siberia (Ajj)) is a 
pocket of organic material subducted by cryogenic process into the mineral 
soil. Recent data indicate that cryoturbated organic horizons have distinctly 
176different microbial community composition and enzyme activities from the 
regular soil horizons (Siberia (O) and (Bcg); Harden et al.  1992; Gittel et al.  
2014; Schnecker et al.  2014), which presumably retards decomposition rate, 
leading to high age of cryoturbated organic horizons (Kaiser et al.  2007; Wild 
et al.  2013). Soil samples from Marka, Tsomoriri and the Ajj horizon of Siberian 
Turbic Cryosol represent the most extreme of our soil samples in terms of 
climatic and edaphic conditions. 
 In terms of land management, our dataset includes pristine sampling sites 
with no intervention regime (Marka, Tsomoriri, Petunia, Suilven, Plesne, Pop 
Ivan), semi-natural sampling sites with intervention regime (Certovo, 
Forsinard, Strasan), and sampling sites with extensive (Ohrazeni, Skogaby) and 
intensive agriculture (Malvirata) or forestry (Tarvisio). 
Plesne and Certovo sampling sites represent special case in regards to land 
management and P cycling. Both sites have similar vegetation, elevation, mean 
annual temperature and precipitation (Tab. 1), but different land management. 
Both sites underwent bark beetle outbreaks. The Plesne site is not managed, 
whereas the Certovo site is managed. Therefore, tree-level dieback occurred on 
Plesne site, but not on Certovo site, where attacked trees were cut and 
removed (Kopacek et al.  2015) . That let to dissimilar changes in soil chemistry 
and biological activity (Kaňa, Tahovská & Kopáček 2012; Kaňa et al. 2015) . 
Both sites are of special importance for this work because recent studies 
suggest unknown biological controls over P leaching from these sites 
(Tahovská et al. in press ; Kopacek et al.  2015) .  
 The latitudinal gradient of spruce forest ecosystems Plesne – Certovo – 
Skogaby – Stråsan represents a trend of decreasing atmospheric N deposition 
(Rappe-George et al. in prep. ). While the Strasan site received very low 
atmospheric N deposition, Plesne and Certovo sites were heavily polluted and 
their soils are considered to be N saturated. The  
Ohrazeni sampling site is a managed oligotrophic meadow, which is mowed 
annually (Lepš 2014) . This site represents the extensive agriculture type of 
land management. The intensive agriculture type of management is 
represented by the two sampling sites Malvirata and Tarvisio. The first one is a 
paddy field with continuous rice plantation (one harvest per year, no winter 
cover crops, regularly fertilized) and the second one is a managed spruce 
forest undergoing regular clear cutting.  
 
 
 
 
177Experimental set -up 
Appendix 1 highlighted the importance of  microbial biomass C as driver of 
both degradation of the organic C substrate and immobilization of inorganic P 
(Cm, equations [A2] – [A4]). To compare the different soils, it is essential to 
have the same Cm in all tested samples, but natural variation in  Cm is large 
among soils (Tab. 1). Thus, soils were manipulated to achieve the same Cm in 
the final samples used for incubation. To this aim, all soils were mixed with 
sterile sand in the same ratio of 25:1 (w/w; sand:soil), but the amount of the 
sand -soil mixture that was incubated was chosen in proportion to Cm of the 
original soil. As a result, each incubated sample (soil -sand mixture of variable 
amount) contained 35 µmol of Cm at the beginning of incubation. Because of 
this procedure, we had to adjust a mount and concentration of basal medium 
accordingly. Basal medium was added in volume to achieve 75% WHC of the 
incubated mixture (to avoid water limitation). The concentration of basal 
medium had to be appropriately manipulated to add organic C equal to 2 0 
times Cm, which is 700 µmol. In this way, we achieved precisely defined 
conditions, which are microbial biomass specific. Thus, the growth rate and P 
amount are microbial biomass -specific. The measured growth rate therefore 
represents the growth rate of the whole microbial community and the P 
amount represents all available P supplied in the growth medium, which is 
evenly distributed in the sample.  
 The high dilution of soil with sterile sand was done in order to minimize 
the background effect of soil or ganic C and nutrients, which naturally differ 
among soils. For example, soil residual P was on average 150 times lower than 
PCR across all soil samples. Similarly, residual soil organic C was on average 80 
times lower than added amount of organic C in basa l medium. We did not 
account for residual soil C, N or P in our calculations. First of all, it is uncertain 
whether all K 2SO 4 extractable C, N, and NaHCO 3 extractable P are directly 
available to the microbial community, but even if they were available, the ir 
amount in the final sand/soil mixture was negligibly small .  
 
Microbial and soil analysis  
Microbial biomass C (C m) and N (N m) were estimated as follows: 5g of naturally 
wet soil was weighted in 100 ml bottles. Half of them were fumigated for 24 
hours in the dark. Fumigated and unfumigated soil samples were shaken with 
20 ml of 0.5 M K 2SO 4 for 30 min at room temperature and 170 rot./min. 
Extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 g and filtered through glass filters (MN GF -5, Macherey -nagel, Germany). The aliquots were kept frozen until 
measurement. The concentration of dissolved organic C and dissolved total N 
in the aliquots was measured with a DOC/DN analyzer (LiquicTOC II, 
Elemantar, Germany). Microbial biomass C and N were respectively calculated 
as differences between dissolved organic C and dissolved total N extracted 
from fumigated and non -fumigated samples. Correction factors of 0.35 and 0.4 
were used for microbial biomass C and N calculation, respectively (Brookes et 
al. 1985; Vance, Brookes & Jenkinson 1987).  
 For microbial biomass P (P m) determination, 2g of fumigated and 
unfumigated soil was shaken with 30 ml of NaHCO 3 (pH=8.5) for 45 min at 
room temperature and 170 rot./min. After centrifugation, extracts were 
acidified and filtered. The aliquots were frozen until measurement. P 
concentration in the aliquots was measured spectrophotometrically using a 
method modified after Murphy and Riley (1962). Microbial biomass P was 
calculated as a difference between P extracted from fumigated and non -
fumigated samples with a correction factor of 0.4 (Brookes, Powlson & 
Jenkinson 1982) .  
 The concentrations of C, N and P in non -fumigated samples represents 
available soil C, N and P .  
 
Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) identification and quantification  
Briefly, an appropriate amount of soil or soil/sand mixture containing approx. 
100 µmol of microbial C was extracted twice with one -phase extraction 
mixture consisting of chloroform, methanol and citrate buffer. After phase 
separation (overnight), the organic phase was purified on silica columns (SPE -
SI Supleclean 500mg/3 mL; Supelco, USA) using chloroform, acetone and 
methanol. The polar (methanol) fraction containing phospholipids was trans -
esterified to the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by a mild alkaline 
methanolysis (Bossio & Scow 1998) . The following fatty acids were used to 
describe the microbial community composition: a14:0, i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, 
i17:0, a17:0, 17:1n9, i18:0 as markers of Gram -positive bacteria ( G+); 16:1n11, 
16:1n9, 16:1n7, 16:1n5, cy17:0, 18:1n7, cy19:0 as markers of Gr am-negative 
bacteria (G -) (Kaiser et al.  2010); 13Me:16, 10Me16:0, 10Me17:0, 10Me18:0 as 
markers of Actinobacteria (Kroppenstedt 1985)  and 18:1n9, 18:2n6,9 as 
markers of fungi (Frostegard & Baath 1996). Total bacterial biomass was 
calculated as a sum of general bacterial markers 15:0, 17:0, 18:1n11 and 
markers for  G+ and G- bacteria. The PLFAs 14:0, 16:0, 18:0 and 20:0 were 
considered as nonspecific markers (Kaiser et al.  2010) . All PLFAs were 
179quantified by an internal standard calibration procedure using methyl -
nonadecanoate (19:0) as an internal standard. To identify the FAMEs, retention 
times and mass spectra were compared with those obtained from standards 
(Bacterial Acid Methyl Esters standard, the 37 -component FAME Mix, PUFA -2, 
and PUFA -3; all standards purchased from Supelco, USA). The ISQ instrument 
equipped with Focus gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scie ntific, USA) was 
used for detection and chromatographic separation.
