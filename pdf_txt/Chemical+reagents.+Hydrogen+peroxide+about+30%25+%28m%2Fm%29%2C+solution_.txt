Introduction
Printed circuit boards (PCB), are plates made of insulating 
material with electrical connections and solder points, which are used for assembly of electronic subunits and provide electrical connections between the components. PCBs are components of virtually all electronic devices, including weapon systems and aviation equipment. PCB manufacturing is multi-stage, whereas the main processes (machining, photochemical and galvanic processing) are common to all types of printed circuit boards. Photochemical and galvanic processes are the primary source of wastewater and consumed technology baths. During photochemical processing, transferring the image of circuit layer from photographic ﬁ lm, glass or directly from data ﬁ les 
containing the designed shape of the tracks on the copper foil takes place (LaDou 2009). Using the direct method (photoprint method) or indirect method (screen printing method), mosaic image is transferred from the block to the plate, wherein when using liquid or solid photopolymers, when they are exposed to UV light, the development of unexposed photopolymer is carried out in alkaline solutions of Na
2CO3 or K2CO3 with 
the addition of measures to prevent the production of foam. The development process is run automatically (horizontally), whereas wastewater and consumed developing bath is produced. Similarly, the process of developing solder masks is 
done (Mika 1983, Michalski 1992, Coombs and Holden 1996). In both cases, the used solutions of Na
2CO3 or K2CO3 and 
rinsing water from such processes are the source of alkaline wastewater. Furthermore, before an etching process, the washing of photopolymer takes place which is carried out in several percent hot solutions of NaOH or KOH with the addition of compounds preventing the formation of foam. Also this process is a source of alkaline wastewater (Mika 1983, Michalski 1992, Coombs and Holden 1996). Using photopolymers and masks developed in alkaline solution causes the formation of wastewater which contains a certain amount of Na
2CO3, K2CO3, 
NaOH, KOH, anti-foam agents and particles of photopolymer and paint. The last can cause the COD of wastewater to go up to 15 000 mg O
2/L (Michalski 1992). The concentration 
of dissolved organic compounds in the consumed process solution is 5–10 g/L, which corresponds to COD in the range of 10 000–20 000 mg O
2/L. The wastewater may further contain 
1–2 mg Cu/L, assuming that for the development of 0.15 m2 of 
photopolymer, 1L of developer is consumed (Hartinger 1991). Other literature data also shows that the COD of wastewater from the process of developing and washing of photopolymers may be in the range of 2 390–25 678 mg O
2/L (Shipley 1994, 
Gliklich et al. 2006). Puri ﬁ cation of this type of wastewater is Archives of Environmental Protection

Abstract:  The possibility of removing organic compounds from wastewater originating from the photochemical 
production of printed circuit boards by use of waste acidi ﬁ cation and disposal of precipitated photopolymer 
in the ﬁ rst stage and the UV-Fenton method in a second stage has been presented. To optimize the process of 
advanced oxidation, the RSM (Response Surface Methodology) for three independent factors was applied, i.e. pH, the concentration of Fe(II) and H
2O2 concentration. The use of optimized values of individual parameters in 
the process of wastewater treatment caused a decrease in the concentration of the organic compounds denoted as COD by approx. 87% in the ﬁ rst stage and approx. 98% after application of both processes. Precipitation and 
the decomposition of organic compounds was associated with a decrease of wastewater COD to below 100 mg O
2/L whereas the initial value was 5550 mg O2/L. Decomposition of organic compounds and veri ﬁ cation of the 
developed model of photopolymers removal was also carried out with use of alternative H2O2 sources i.e. CaO2, 
MgO2, and Na2CO3·1,5H2O2.40 M. Thomas, B. Bia łecka, D. Zdebik
carried out by methods of ultra ﬁ ltration that is rarely used or by 
precipitation, which involves acidi ﬁ cation of the wastewater 
by means of concentrated acid to pH 2–3, which results in precipitation of photopolymers, that shows good solubility only in an alkaline medium. Acidi ﬁ cation causes precipitation 
of a sticky residue and after separation, pre-treated wastewater is further treated with activated carbon wherein COD is reduced typically to 400 mg O
2/L. A further neutralization is 
carried out with suspension of Ca(OH)2 or NaOH solution, and 
the remaining sludge is combusted in the equipment designed for incineration of such waste (Michalski 1992). Another method requires acidi ﬁ cation of the wastewater with 10–15% 
HCl to pH < 2 and separation of the precipitated photopolymer by means of ﬁ ltration. The acidic ef ﬂ uent is neutralized with 
10% Na
2CO3 to pH 5.5–7.0 and active carbon is added in an 
amount of 5–10 kg for 0.8 m3 of ef ﬂ uent. The wastewater is 
subjected to ﬁ ltration and directed to the wastewater system 
(Grychtolik et al. 1990). Other authors point out that in the case of periodic methods of wastewater treatment and using acidi ﬁ cation, precipitated sediments are of gelatinous structure 
and are very dif ﬁ cult to ﬁ lter out. In such circumstances, using 
a commercially available acidic coagulant is necessary to induce acidi ﬁ cation effect and obtain a fairly dense and easily 
sedimenting sludge. An additional problem in the case of using complex compounds in the process of commercially available baths are high concentrations of complexed compounds Cu(II) (70–350 mg/L), in contrast to conventional carbonate-based developers which can contain Cu(II) compounds in an amount of 0.2–0.3 mg/L (Keller and Goosey 1999). As shown by the literature data, the use of ultra ﬁ ltration for wastewater 
treatment is connected with formation of the concentrated retentate, which also has to be treated by acidi ﬁ cation. The 
use of the acidi ﬁ cation process is associated, as noted above, 
with the addition of HCl or H
2SO4, wherein the literature data 
indicates a preferred pH range of 1–5. In this pH range, polymer particles precipitate andare polymerized or insoluble in the acidic environment, whereas the literature data referring to the assumed reduction of COD is not representative since during the acidi ﬁ cation of the mixture of developer and stripper mixed 
in a volume ratio of 3: 1 to about pH < 1, the COD values were obtained which corresponded to 25–30% of starting material value. What is more, recommended in many publications treatment with active carbon and given ﬁ nal COD value of 
400 mg O
2/L, in many cases is not possible to be achieved 
(Hartinger 1991). Improving properties of the precipitated gelatinous photopolymer can be obtained by the addition of salts of Fe(III) or diatomaceous earth (Hartinger 1991, Goosey and Keller 1999). Puri ﬁ cation of wastewater in question is 
therefore connected with the necessity of precipitation or distribution of dissolved photopolymers and precipitation of Cu(II) in a subsequent puri ﬁ cation stage. In the technology of 
wastewater treatment containing organic substances, methods of advanced oxidation (AOP) are used for the decomposition of organic substances with different chemical structure present in water (Stasinakis 2008). The origins of the use of Fenton’s reagent, which is formed by the combination of salt solution of Fe(II) and H
2O2 in acid environment, are associated with 
the work on the oxidation of organic acids carried out by H.J.H. Fenton, which showed a strong oxidizing properties of the mixture used in relation to tartaric acid (Dunford 2002). Later investigations continued by Haber and Weiss showed that Fenton’s reagent is characteristic for strong oxidizing 
properties with respect to many organic substances, and the appropriate oxidizing agent is free hydroxyl radical (OH
•), 
characterized by high reactivity, due to its signi ﬁ cant oxidizing 
potential (E0=2.31V) (Parson 2004). Fenton’s reaction is 
a radical reaction, and proceeds according to the equation (1):
 Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH- + OH• (1)
The course of Fenton’s reaction, however, is more complex 
and associated with a number of occurring intermediate reactions (Barbusi ński 2009). In the system, in addition to 
the generation of free radicals, reactions of their capture by radical scavengers may take place under certain conditions, which may be in the form of H
3O+, Fe2+, HCO-
3, CO2-
3, PO2-
3, Br- 
ions and others (Barbusi ński 2003, Barbusi ński 2004). Fe(II)/
H2O2/UV process, in which through the use of UV radiation 
the regeneration of Fe(II) takes place and a further quantity of OH
• is formed, is a process of greater ef ﬁ ciency compared 
to the classical Fenton’s reaction, in which the Fe(III) ions are deposited in the system and the rate of oxidation process decreases. In the photocatalytic Fenton’s reaction, photoreduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) occurs as well as photolysis of H
2O2 according to the reactions (2) and (3):
 Fe(OH)2+ ⎯→⎯hvFe2+ + OH•, Ȝ < 580 nm  (2)
 H2O2 ⎯→⎯hv 2OH•, Ȝ < 310 nm  (3)
Reaction (3) plays a minor role in the process of 
generating an additional quantity of free radicals, hence H2O2 
displays lower absorption capacity of photons regarding UV (Barbusi ński 2006, Pouran et al. 2015). A number of 
studies have been carried out on use of alternative sources of H
2O2, useful in the Fenton reaction, such as calcium 
peroxide (CaO2), magnesium peroxide (MgO2) and sodium 
percarbonate (Na2CO3·1,5H2O2), which usually turned out 
to be more ef ﬁ cient in wastewater treatment than the classic 
Fenton’s reagent, owing to the slow release of H2O2 from metal 
peroxides, even formation of radicals OH• and therefore their 
more ef ﬁ cient operation (Barbusi ński 2006). Similar results in 
terms of increased ef ﬁ ciency of CaO2 were obtained in the case 
of wastewater treatment from the manufacture of PCBs. When using an equivalent dose of CaO
2 in relation to H2O2, the COD 
of wastewater was obtained which is approx. 6% less than in the experiment in which a 30% solution of H
2O2 was used (Thomas 
et al. 2016). Fenton’s reagent in the modi ﬁ cation with sodium 
percarbonate was also used for treatment of wastewater from the production of PCBs and it showed that under the optimum conditions of the process, it is possible to reduce the COD of wastewater by 72.8% (Thomas et al. 2015). The combination of Fenton process and co-precipitation of ferrite was applied to the treatment of wastewater from the production of PCBs containing organic compounds and heavy metals. At pH 2, Fe(II) concentration of 500 mg/L, H
2O2 concentration of 3000 mg/L 
and a reaction time of 60 min, the initial values of COD and TOC (406 mg O
2/L and 134 mg/L) were decreased to 84.9 mg 
O2/L and 58.3 mg/L (Lou et al. 2009). The main parameters  Removal of Organic Compounds from Wastewater Originating from the Production of Printed Circuit Board...  41
that determine the performance of the Fenton’s reaction is pH, 
the concentration of Fe(II), H2O2 concentration, temperature 
and also the intensity and time of exposure in the case of UV-Fenton process. These parameters usually require optimization to achieve maximum ef ﬁ ciency of Fenton’s reaction for the 
given type of tested wastewater. Design of Experiments (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), which are commonly used in chemistry, chemical technology and engineering environment are used for this purpose to optimize various kinds of processes (Zieli ński 2007, Barbusi ński and 
Fajkis 2011, Azami et al. 2012, Maha and Tony 2014, Cao et al. 2014). The aim of this study was to combine the previously used method of acidi ﬁ cation (precipitation of signi ﬁ cant 
amount of dissolved photopolymers due to their low solubility in an acidic medium), and UV-Fenton method (decomposition of the remaining photopolymers and the maximum reduction of COD wastewater) for treatment of wastewater from the photochemical treatment of printed circuit boards. The study was conducted using the methods of experiment planning (central compositional plan), while the response surface method was used for analysis and visualization of the obtained results, the construction of a mathematical model and determination of the optimum process conditions.
Materials and methods
Materials and chemical reagentsThe study used raw industrial wastewater directly from the manufacturing plant of printed circuit boards located in Poland. Development of photopolymers and solder masks was carried out in 1% solution of Na
2CO3 and K2CO3 to which 
anti-foam agent was added containing ethoxylated fatty acids. Raw wastewater consisting of used development baths and rinsing waters ﬂ ew through pipelines from machines to storage 
tanks located at the wastewater treatment plant, where it was followed by averaging composition of wastewater. Samples of raw wastewater were taken from alkaline wastewater storage tank for 7 days. The sample of wastewater for testing in the laboratory scale was obtained by averaging the general sample. The collected sample of wastewater was not ﬁ xed, 
and the physicochemical composition of raw wastewater is shown in Table 1. The following were used for the study: FeSO
4·7H2O (POCH, Poland), 30% H2O2, (CHEMPUR, 
Poland), and pH adjustment was performed using H2SO4 and NaOH with concentrations of 10%, and in the ﬁ nal phase 
of 1% (CHEMPUR, Poland). The studies used reagents of analytical purity and double-distilled water (CHEMPUR, Poland). As an alternative sources of H
2O2, the following were 
used: CaO2 (Ixper®75C Calcium Peroxide, Solvay Chemicals 
International S.A), MgO2 (Ixper®35M Magnesium Peroxide, 
Solvay Chemicals International S.A.) and Na2CO3·1,5H2O2 
(Sodium Percarbonate, Brenntag, Poland). The previous studies (Barbusi ński 2006) con ﬁ rmed a linear correlation 
between the dose of peroxides and the amount of formed H
2O2 
in pH range 1–5. It was con ﬁ rmed by analysis (determination 
of H2O2 was made using manganometric method) that from 
1 g of CaO2, MgO2 and Na2CO3·1,5H2O2 used in the study, 
in an acidic medium (pH 2, H2SO4) was released 342, 223 
and 282 mg of H2O2, respectively. The content of H2O2 in the 
adopted research of CaO2, MgO2 and Na2CO3·1,5H2O2, was 
34.2, 22.3 and 28.2%, respectively. The determination of H2O2 
was made using manganometric method before the tests.
Analytical methods
Using the device Elmetron CPC411 with a combination electrode ERH-11S in compliance with PN-EN ISO 10523:2012, pH was determined. Turbidity was determined by nephelometry method using a turbidimeter CyberScan IR Turbidimeter TB1000 according to PN-EN ISO 7027-1:2016-09. COD was determined by spectrophotometry using closed tubes and spectrophotometers Spekol 1200 according to PN ISO 15705:2005, and TOC using high combustion temperature of 680ºC with IR detection using analyzer TOC-L
CPH by Shimadzu in compliance with PN-EN 
1484:1999. Chlorides were determined by titration method according to PN ISO 9297:1994, and sulphates(VI) by weight method according to PN ISO 9280: 2002. Heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Sn) were determined using ISP-OES using spectrometer Optima 5300DV by Perkin Elmer according to PN-EN ISO 11885: 2009. The content of H
2O2 in wastewater and in peroxides was 
determined manganometrically according to BN-89/6191-04.
Methodology of research
First, the effect of acidi ﬁ cation with concentrated H2SO4 on 
the change of the value of COD was examined, in other words the ef ﬁ ciency of photopolymer removal from wastewater by 
means of the low solubility in an acidic medium. The study was conducted on a sample of raw wastewater with a volume of 1L, to which concentrated H
2SO4 was added during simultaneous

measurement of pH. With the total pH values (1–9), wastewater 
was sampled in order to determine COD and sulphates(VI). Based on the carried out studies, the impact of H
2SO4 dosage on 
concentration of sulphates(VI) and COD values of wastewater under analysis was researched. Further studies were carried out using samples of wastewater pre-acidi ﬁ ed to pH 3 and ﬁ ltered 
through the ﬁ lter fabric having a basis weight of 140–160 g/m
2 
in order to separate precipitated photopolymer. Studies using AOP, were carried out in photoreactor with a working volume of 580 ml, equipped with a UV lamp (11W, 254 nm, PURITEC
® HNS, OSRAM®) arranged in the casing of quartz 
glass and then cooled by air supplied to the interior of the casing by a diaphragm pump, with a capacity of 400 L/h (JBL POSILENT
® A400). Analysed wastewater was poured into 
the reactor and appropriate amounts of H2SO4, FeSO4·7H2O 
and H2O2 were added. The content of photoreactor was stirred 
at a constant speed of 250 rpm. Simultaneously, continuous temperature measurement of irradiated waste was performed and regulation of the ﬂ ow rate of the air supply in such a way 
as to ensure constant temperature of the irradiated wastewater 18.0 ± 0.5°C. After completion of oxidation process, the wastewater samples were subjected to alkalisation with 30% NaOH to pH 10.2 in order to precipitate Fe(II) and Fe(III) in the form of Fe(OH)
2 and Fe(OH)3 and residual distribution of 
H2O2. Then, after ﬁ ltration of wastewater through a membrane 
ﬁ lter, residual values of H2O2 and COD were determined. 
In view of the fact that the residual content of H2O2 resulted 
in an increase in the COD of wastewater, the value of COD determined analytically was corrected. In order to standardize the results, appropriate correction was calculated by assuming for all the determined concentrations of H
2O2, the theoretical 
value of the COD for the 1 mg of H2O2 equal to 0.471 mg O2/L 
(Talinli and Anderson 1992). A comparative study was carried out using CaO
2, MgO2 and Na2CO3·1,5H2O2 as alternative 
sources of H2O2, at doses equivalent to the optimal dose of 
H2O2 adopted after optimization testing.
Experimental design
The optimization of the process of removing dissolved photopolymers from industrial wastewater using photocatalytic Fenton’s reaction was performed using the response surface methodology (Plackett-Burman Experimental Design) and Statistica 10 software (StatSoft, Poland). In the ﬁ rst stage, 
on the basis of the previous studies conducted by the authors (Thomas et al. 2015, Thomas et al. 2016) and the literature (Lou et al. 2009), an analysis of previously obtained results was performed, in order to optimally select the type of dependent and independent parameters and input values to the independent parameters. The following parameters were taken into account: temperature (°C), stirring speed (rpm), irradiation time (min.), pH, the concentration of H
2O2 (g/L), 
and the concentration of Fe(II) (g/L). In the next stage, the experiment plan was established, i.e., the determination of the ﬁ nal values of the independent variables for which 
measurement of the dependent variable (COD) was performed and the amount of experiments established. The required number of experiments was carried out for the given values of the independent variables, measuring the value of the dependent variable (COD) in accordance with the adopted plan. In the last stage, the signi ﬁ cance of the coef ﬁ cients of 
the function describing the process was veri ﬁ ed, suitability of the function to the research object was veri ﬁ ed and a revised 
form of the function was provided. For the purposes of this study, the following designations for the dependent variable and independent variables were adopted:
x
1 – pH, 
x2 – concentration of Fe(II), g/L, 
x3 – concentration of H2O2, g/L, 
Z1 – COD, g O2/L. 
The mixing speed (250 rpm), irradiation time (60 min.) 
and temperature (18.0 ± 0.5°C) were adopted as constants. On the basis of preliminary research conducted by the authors, in which the smallest value of COD was obtained after 50–60 min. of photocatalytic Fenton’s reaction (Fe(II)/H
2O2/UV) with UV 
light irradiation at a temperature of 18.0 ± 0.5°C, the safe, constant time of the process was assumed at 60 min. Moreover, appropriate range of H
2O2 doses was assumed, i.e., 4 to 6 g/L 
of wastewater and the molar ratio of Fe(II)/H2O2 0.11–0.20, 
corresponding to a concentration of Fe(II) in the range of 0.875–1.625 g/L. On the basis of preliminary studies, pH in the range of 1.75–2.75 was adopted for planning the experiment. Finally, using the determinations listed above, it was adopted:
 x
1  ˂1.75; 2.75>,
 x2  ˂0.875; 1.625>, (1)
 x3  ˂4.0; 6.0>
It was assumed that these ranges will be subjected to 
regulation in the range <-1, +1>:
 x1(-1) = 1.75 x1(0) = 2.25 x1(+1) = 2.75,
 x2(-1) = 0.875 x2(0) = 1.25 x2(+1) = 1.625, (2)
 x3(-1) = 4.0 x3(0) = 5.0 x1(+1) = 6.0.
The adopted initial ranges of independent factors were 
expanded, which resulted from standardization in the range of <-α, α>, instead of initially adopted standardization of <-1.1>, 
for which α=1. After the adoption of α = 1.6818 (on the basis 
of the experiment plan), the ranges of speci ﬁ ed parameters 
adopted the following values in the plan:
 x
1(-α) = 1.41 x1(0) = 2.25 x1(+α) = 2.75;
 x2(-α) = 0.619 x2(0) = 1.250 x2(+α) = 1.881; (3)
 x3(-α) = 3.318 x3(0) = 5.000 x1(+α) = 6.682
The central compositional plan was adopted for the 
planning, as a result of which 16 experiments for three independent factors (pH, concentration of Fe(II) and H
2O2) 
were obtained. The experiment plan and obtained results are shown in Table 2. The results of the model studies are shown in a graphic form by means of response surface plots, allowing for precise analysis of the effects of the independent variables (pH, concentration of Fe(II) and H
2O2) on the value of the 
dependent variable (COD).
Results and discussion
Precipitation of the photopolymers by acidi ﬁ cation
The test wastewater was characterized by a high turbidity (910 NTU), high pH value (10.3) and a high content of organic compounds expressed by COD and TOC values (5550 mg  Removal of Organic Compounds from Wastewater Originating from the Production of Printed Circuit Board...  43
O2/L and 2000 mg/L, respectively). The content of heavy 
metals (mainly Cu) was less than 1 mg/L. A result of the slow dispensing of concentrated H
2SO4 was intensive foaming of the 
wastewater with gas release (CO2), due to the decomposition 
of Na2CO3 or K2CO3 present in wastewater. Together with the 
decreasing value of pH, precipitation of a large amount of a spongy sediment was observed. The volume of precipitated photopolymer (out of 1L of wastewater), after 30 min. of sedimentation amounted to approx. 400 mL. The precipitated viscous, amorphous sediment was separated and ﬁ ltrated. The 
study showed that with decreasing pH of wastewater as a result of dispensing H
2SO4, the decrease in the COD value occurred, 
whereas the lowest values were observed ranging from pH 4 (750–785 mg O
2/L). The greatest reduction in COD values was 
observed with pH within 5–6. At the same time, an increase in the sulphate(VI) concentration to a value between 4 920–5 160 
at pH 3–4 was observed. As shown by the analysis of COD value changes, further dosing of H
2SO4 (and consequently 
unfavourable increase in the concentration of sulphates(VI)) was not justi ﬁ ed, because it did not cause further reduction in 
the COD value, as shown in Fig. 1. Wastewater pre-acidi ﬁ ed to 
pH 3 and ﬁ ltered through the ﬁ lter fabric in order to separate 
precipitated purpose of photopolymers of COD value 716 mg O
2/L was used for the study.

corresponding COD values for wastewater were obtained, also 
shown in Table 3. The lowest values of COD were obtained in experiments 14, 15 and 16, and the highest values in experiment 9. Table 3 shows the data sheet with estimates of ANOV A effects and model coef ﬁ cients for the normalized values of the 
input quantities i.e. pH, concentration of Fe(II) and H
2O2. The 
carried out statistical analysis showed four parameters which are statistically signi ﬁ cant, i.e. pH(L), pH(Q), Fe(II)(L) as 
well as H
2O2(L). For further analysis, all of the major linear-
-quadratic effects were adopted, but negligible linear-linear interaction effects were excluded from the model (1L i/o 2L, 1L i/o 3L and 2L i/o 3L) due to the higher value of the corrected coef ﬁ cient of determination (R

adj) for a model in which these 
interactions are not considered. The results of the statistical analysis are shown in Table 3. The calculated coef ﬁ cient of 
determination (R
2), and corrected coef ﬁ cient of determination 
(R2
adj), adopted the values of 0.86 and 0.77, respectively, which 
indicated good adjustment of the model to experimental data. The value of the corrected coef ﬁ cient of determination 
(R
2
adj=0.77) also indicated good adjustment of the model to 
other experimental data, describing the process of removing dissolved photopolymer from the wastewater originating from the production of PCBs, using photocatalytic Fenton’s reaction. A low mean square error value, i.e.: approx. 0.004 was 
obtained as a result of the analysis. Table 4 shows the results of the veri ﬁ cation of the adequacy of the model using ANOV A, 
which also pointed to the importance of (Fisher’s test) the four major input parameters, i.e., pH, (L), pH (Q), Fe(II) (Q) and H
2O2(L). Fig. 3 shows a Pareto graph presenting the estimates 
of standardized effects that have been grouped according to their absolute value. The vertical line represents the minimum values of statistically signi ﬁ cant effects at the signi ﬁ cance level 
α = 0.05. The data shown in Fig. 2 also indicate the importance

and the pH(L) and the insigni ﬁ cance (or low signi ﬁ cance) of 
the other two main factors, i.e., Fe(II)(L) and H2O2(Q). In order 
to visually verify the quality of the adjustment of experimental data derived from oxidation processes to the created model, the graph showing the dependency of the predicted values on values observed was plotted and presented in Fig. 3. The analysis of the data shown in Fig. 3 indicates a good adjustment of the experimental values to the predicted values, which demonstrates (in conjunction with the values of determination coef ﬁ cients 
calculated for the model) that the created model is suitable for experimental data from the process of oxidation. Fig. 4 shows the change in COD values, depending on the concentration of

Fe(II) and the pH assuming a constant concentration of H2O2 
5.0 g/L. Model tests carried out showed that the lowest COD values were obtained with pH within the range 2.1–2.5 and Fe(II) concentration in the range 1.1–1.6 g/L, and assuming a constant concentration of H
2O2 5 g/L. The biggest (<0.1 gO2/L) 
efﬁ ciency of organic compounds removal, expressed as 
COD was observed in the presented, optimum concentration ranges for the individual reactants. Apart from the ranges of concentrations, an increase in the value of COD was observed. The mathematical description of changes in COD values, after removal from the model of negligible interaction, as a function of the concentration of Fe(II) and pH, assuming a constant concentration of H
2O2 5 g/L, is represented by the equation (4):
 COD (g/L) = 3.277 – 2.061[pH] + 0.437[pH]2 –
 – 1.147[Fe(II)] + 0.426[Fe(II)]2 (4) COD (g/L) = 3.151 – 2.061[pH] + 0.437[pH]2 –
 – 0.209[H2O2] + 0.016[H2O2]2 (5)
Fig. 5 shows the change in COD depending on the 
concentration of H2O2 and pH assuming constant concentration 
of the Fe(II) 1.25 g/L. On the basis of model tests, the smallest (<0.1 gO
2/L) COD value was observed in the range of pH 2.0–2.7 
using concentration of H2O2 >4.6 g/L and a constant concentration 
of Fe(II) ions of 1.25 g/L. It was observed that lowering the concentration of H
2O2 resulted in increase of COD value, similarly 
as increase or decrease of pH, and the ef ﬁ ciency of removal of 
organic compounds is dependent on the pH of the environment. The mathematical description of the changes of COD value after removal from the model of non-essential interactions, as a function of H
2O2 concentration and pH, assuming a constant concentration 
of the Fe(II) 1.25 g/L, is represented by the equation (5):

Fig. 6 shows the change in COD value depending on the 
concentration of H2O2 and Fe(II) assuming a constant value 
of pH at 2.25. The smallest (<0.05 gO2/L) COD values  were 
observed at concentrations of Fe(II) ions in the range of 1.2–1.4 g/L and at a concentration of H
2O2 >5.8 g/L and 
performing the process at a constant pH of 2.25. At a constant pH of 2.25, increasing or decreasing the concentration of Fe(II) ions in the reaction medium, and lowering the concentration of H
2O2 resulted in the increase of the COD value and also 
the reduction of the ef ﬁ ciency of puri ﬁ cation process. Fig. 6 
allows us to notice that increasing the concentration of H2O2 
above 7 g/L, resulted in a slight increase in COD. The model studies carried out result in the need for precise selection of the concentrations of various reagents in order to obtain the maximum effect of the removal of organic compounds. The mathematical description of the changes of COD value after removal from the model of non-essential interactions as a function of the concentration of H
2O2 and Fe(II), and assuming a constant pH of 2.25, is represented by the 
equation (6):
 COD (g/L) = 1.494 – 1.147[Fe(II)] + 0.426[Fe(II)]2 –
 – 0.209[H2O2] + 0.016[H2O2]2 (6)
Table 5 shows critical values for the model of changes 
of the COD value, i.e., pH, concentration of Fe(II) ions and H
2O2 concentration. The analysis carried out showed that the 
adopted critical values, i.e., pH of 2.36, concentration of Fe(II) ions 1.35 g/L and concentration of H
2O2 6.49 g/L correspond 
to the approximated value of the COD 39 mg O2/L. Therefore, 
carrying out the oxidation process using the critical pH values and the critical concentrations of the various reagents for 60 min. irradiation with a 11W UV lamp and at a temperature of 18.0 ± 0.5°C at a stirring rate of 250 rpm, should result in obtaining the treated wastewater for which COD should be 39 mg O
2/L. Table 6 shows the values of determination

coef ﬁ cients for the full model of removing organic compounds 
expressed as COD, taking into account all the major linear--square effects and linear-linear interaction effects (1L i/o 2L, 1L i/o 3L and 2L i/o 3L). To determine the approximating polynomial for the experimental data presented in Table 3, a general linear model (GLM) was adopted using the results adjusted for the intergroup system, wherein it was assumed that a polynomial II is suitable to describe the process of removing organic compounds present in the wastewater from PCB production using the Fe(II)/H
2O2/UV system. Approximating 
polynomial was obtained in the form of ‘prediction equation’, which describes the change of COD value as a function of all independent factors, i.e., pH, the concentration of Fe(II) and H
2O2 concentration, is represented by the equation (7):
 COD (g/L) = 3.762 – 2.130[pH] + 0.437[pH]2 –
 – 0.879[Fe(II)] + 0.426[Fe(II)]2 – 0.182[H2O2] +

 + 0.016[pH][H2O2] – 0.050[Fe(II)][H2O2] 
The calculated value of the coef ﬁ cient of determination 
for the full model (R2=0.88) indicates a very good adjustment 
of the model to experimental data, while the value of the corrected coef ﬁ cient of determination (R
2
adj=0.69) indicates 
a good adjustment of the model approximating the equation to the set of other experimental data from the oxidation of organic compounds in the wastewater from the production of photochemical PCB by means of Fe(II)/H
2O2/UV system.Comparative study using alternative sources 
of hydrogen peroxideComparative studies of the removal of organic compounds from the wastewater from the production of photochemical PCB, subjected to prior acidi ﬁ cation with concentrated H
2SO4 
to pH 3 to precipitate the dissolved photopolymers were also carried out using alternative sources of H
2O2. At the same time, 
the developed model of COD removal, taking critical values (Table 5) of the process, i.e., pH of 2.36, concentration of Fe(II) 1.35 g/L and concentration of H
2O2 6.49 g/L was subjected to 
experimental veri ﬁ cation. The adopted values correspond to the 
projected model of COD value of 39 mg O2/L. In comparative 
studies, instead of 6.49 g H2O2, an equivalent amounts of CaO2, 
MgO2, and Na2CO3·1,5H2O2, were used, from which 6.49 g of 
H2O2 was released due to reaction with water. In the course 
of the studies it has been observed that the use of suitable peroxide or sodium percarbonate instead of H
2O2 necessitates 
the need to correct the pH of the wastewater to a value of 2.36 due to the increase of the pH of wastewater after addition of peroxides. During the calculation of equivalent doses of 6.49 g H
2O2, the purity of the technical products used and the results 
of the manganometic analysis were taken into account. The results of the comparative tests are shown in Table 7. Based on the carried out research, in all cases wastewater was obtained which was characterized by a low COD value i.e., in the range of 55–66 mg O
2/L, but these values were not consistent with 
the value calculated from the model, i.e., 39 mg O2/L. In the 
case of adopting H2O2, the obtained value was approx. 69%

higher than the value calculated from the model. In the case 
of using metal peroxides and sodium percarbonate, despite the fact that lower COD values were obtained, i.e., in the range of 55–58 mg O
2/L, yet they could be due to a dilution of the 
sample wastewater subjected to oxidation as a result of the necessary correction of pH by means of concentrated H
2SO4. 
The ﬁ nal COD values,   shown in Table 7, were also in ﬂ uenced 
by the result of the determination of the residual H2O2 in the 
sample of wastewater after oxidation. The procedure of H2O2 
determination required prior to neutralizing the sample to pH of 10.2 had an impact on the accuracy of the determination of H
2O2 and consequently on the ﬁ nal COD value (the determined 
COD value was subtracted by the correction regarding the contents of H
2O2, which in ﬂ uenced the overestimation of the 
results obtained by dichromate method). In addition, the very determination of COD by means of dichromate method was associated with expanded uncertainty of ± 15% for the COD ≥50 
mg O
2/L. Based on the obtained results and taking into account 
the limitations of the analytical methods applied, it cannot be clearly inferred that there is greater photocatalytic ef ﬁ ciency of 
Fenton’s reaction with regard to the treated wastewater when metal peroxides and sodium percarbonate are used.
Conclusion
The carried out studies showed the possibility of using the method of response surface for optimization process of removing organic compounds in the form of dissolved photopolymers in wastewater from the photochemical treatment of PCB using the UV-Fenton method. The use of Fe(II)/H
2O2/UV system 
allowed for further reduction of COD values to less than 100 mg O
2/L. Finally, the results obtained at this stage of the research 
made it possible to con ﬁ rm the possibility of removing organic 
compounds from alkaline wastewater using a combination of two successive processes, i.e.: acidi ﬁ cation with concentrated 
H
2SO4 in a ﬁ rst phase and applying the photocatalytic Fenton’s 
reaction in the second phase. Such a method for removing organic compounds reduces the amount of wastewater by approx. 87% (the ﬁ rst stage) and approx. 98% (after the two processes). 
Model tests and the obtained results of experimental studies allowed us to adjust a mathematical model which described the impact of all the independent factors on the process of COD 
removal from alkaline wastewater. The calculated initial values of the coef ﬁ cient of determination and its correction for the 
full model showed a good adjustment of approximated model equation to experimental data set derived from the oxidation of organic compounds in wastewater from the photochemical production of PCB using Fe(II)/H
2O2/UV system. Model 
studies made it possible to optimize the process and calculate the critical values of pH, concentrations of Fe(II) and H
2O2 for 
the approximated from the model, the minimum value of COD 39 mg O
2/L. Veri ﬁ cation of the model adjustment to the other set 
of experimental data derived from the oxidation process using photocatalytic Fenton’s reaction was performed experimentally well as using alternative sources of H
2O2. As a result of 
performed studies, the ideal correspondence of the experimental values of COD with the COD value calculated from the model (respectively – the minimum experimental value of 55 mg O
2/L 
and 39 mg O2/L), has not been obtained. Due to the impact of 
several factors on the ﬁ nal result of the determination of COD 
value on the basis of the obtained difference in the results and in connection with the value of the adjusted coef ﬁ cient of 
determination (0.69), it can be concluded that the adjustment of the model was valid for the experimental data obtained. After taking into account the impact of indirect determinations on the result of COD determination and a small dilution of 1 litre wastewater sample during the process, the obtained difference of results was acceptable. The proposed wastewater treatment method enabled obtaining puri ﬁ ed wastewater with a low 
content of organic compounds.
