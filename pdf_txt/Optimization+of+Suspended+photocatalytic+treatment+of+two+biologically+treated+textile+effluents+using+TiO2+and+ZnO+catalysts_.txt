investigated  using powdered TiO 2 and ZnO catalysts with UV -A lamp irradiation . Photodegradation and 
photodecolorization of  the samples real textile i ndustrial wastewater is observed directly proportional to 
pH and catalyst concentrations . Optimum catalyst concentration was found as 2 g  l-1 in both catalysts. 
COD removal in TiO 2 assis ted system  was obtained two fold higher than ZnO  assisted system depending 
characteri stics of the wastewater samples . Optimum pH values were determined  to be 5 and 9 for TiO 2 
and ZnO assisted systems respectively . A COD removal of 45% and 23% were obtained using and ZnO 
catalyst s respectively during 3 h  irradiation . The effluents of photocatalytic treat ed samples using  both 
catalysts  displayed no acute toxicity  at the end of 3 h irradiation time at optimum experimental conditions.

1. Introduction  
 
Textile industry wastewater treatment effluents generally contain large volume of colored effluents and 
contain various textile chemicals which are assessed to be toxic, carcinogenic po isoning harmful effect to 
aquatic environment  (Villegas -Navarr o et al ., 2001;  Meriç et al. , 2005 a; Sharma et al. , 2007; Khan and 
Malik, 2014) . Biological treatment is also insufficient for decolorization due to the large degree of 
aromatics present in dye molecules and the bio-recalcitrant of dyes  (Correia et al ., 1994) . Moreover, 
soluble or particulate COD in the effluent of the biologically treated effluents general ly cause a need to 
search advanced treatment technologies to comply with the strict discharge limits  (Dulekgurgen et al. , 
2007; Selçuk et al ., 2006; Eremektar  et al. , 2007). Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been studied 
as innovative and emerging alternatives for removal of recalcitrant s (Arslan Alaton et al ., 2002) . AOPs 
provide a high or complete removal of color, COD and toxicity in the effluents  (Meriç et al.,  2005b ). 
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the effective AOPs for oxidation of dyes and textile wastewater 
(De Moraes et al ., 2000; Mah moodi et al ., 2006; Pekakis et al ., 2006; Martins et al ., 2006; Alinsafi et al ., 
2007, Gümüş and Akbal , 2011; Lima et al ., 2015). In this process, it is generated free radicals  such as 
hydroxyl with electron -hole pairs in the catalyst system and this can be provided to convert a wide range 
of harmful dyes into non -toxic products, CO 2 and water (Fernandez -Ibanez et al ., 2003; Pelaez et al ., 2012) . 
There ha ve been many advances in catalyst s (Das and Kumar Basu, 2015) , while ZnO and TiO 2 have been 
the most common used photocatalyst in heterogeneous photocatalysis  due to good stability, non -toxicity 
and insolubility  (Alinsafi  et al ., 2007; Pelaez  et al ., 2012) . Although the most common used catalyst  is TiO 2, 654  ÇİFÇİ  AND MERİÇ  
 both catalys ts have similar photocatalytic mechanism and ZnO can often better performance than TiO 2 
for the degradation (Frontistis et al. , 2012). Both catalysts have similar band gap energy (3.2 eV and 3.02 
eV of TiO 2 and ZnO respectively ) and photocatalytic activity  levels (Abdollahi et al ., 2014; Pekakis et al. , 
2006) . However, ZnO has a higher condu ctivity and less stable than TiO 2 (Hoye et al ., 2013). Less stable 
characteri stics  of ZnO cause to enhance photocorrosion  of ZnO and this could be decrease d the 
photocatalytic activity (Hariharan, 2006). Furthermore, optimum pH value of each catalyst is different due 
to the different zero point of charge values ( pH ZPC) (Rizzo et al ., 2013 ; Abdollahi et al ., 2014 ). The most 
important advantages of ZnO  are absorbing more bigger fraction of the solar spectrum and also more 
active in sunlight than TiO 2 (Sakthivel et al. , 2003; Chandraboss et al ., 2013) . However , as all other AOPs , 
these processes also need toxicity based optimization to obtain saf e effluent for the environment  (Rizzo 
et al ., 201 4). Daphnia magna  is often used for the evaluation of acute/chronic toxicity in textile 
wastewater due to relatively simple test procedure and reproducibility of the results (Villegas -Navarr o et 
al., 2001; Meriç et al. , 2005 a; b; Selçuk et al ., 2006 ; Sharma et al. , 2007 ) as well as  of photocatalytic treated 
textile effluents (De Moraes  et al., 2000) . Moreover, it has been well tested on photocatalytic treated 
municipal wastewater for reuse (Rizzo et al., 2014 ) and water (Selçuk et al ., 2011)  where emerging organic 
pollutants occur red. On the other hand, textile industry wastewater contains some metals including TiO 2 
(Windler et al ., 2012)  which can cause toxicity in the receiving waters  (Aruoja et al ., 2009)  when they 
become  photocatalytically sensitized nanoparticles (Hund -Rinke and Simon, 2006) . Thus, photocatalysis 
process needs to be followed by bioassays to test any hazard from phototransformation by -products and 
residual nanoparticles involved i n the process for obtaining safe effluent.   
The present study aimed to optim ize suspended photocatalytic process  using TiO 2 and ZnO catalysts in 
two biological ly treated textile effluents  which w ere characterized in a wide range of organic and color 
content , to ensure discharge limits and to evaluate reuse po ssibility . The catalyst loading  and pH were 
optimized by means of COD, TOC, color and aromaticity removal in parallel to a cute toxicity evolution to 
Daphnia magna  for safeguard of treated effluents .  
 
2. Materials and methods  
 
2.1. Sampling  
Two biologically t reated textile wastewater effluents (WW1 and WW2) were collected from a dyeing and 
finishing textile industry located in Corlu, Tekirdag, Turkey . Grab  samples were taken in November  and 
December 2014 . 
2.2. Chemicals  
Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (CAS Number  13463 -67-7) with specific surface 
areas of 35 -65 m2 g-1 (BET) and mean particle size of 21 nm . Zinc oxide (ZnO) was provided from  Merck 
(CAS Number  1314 -13-2; Catalog No: 8849) with a specific surface area of 47  m2 g-1 (BET) and mean 
particle size of 230 nm (Hikmat et al., 2010; Alizadeh et al ., 2007) . 
2.3. Experimental procedures  
The photocatalytic experiments were carried out at UV Photoreactor equipped with sixteen UV -A light 
lamps (Philips, 8W) in 350 nm wavelength at a constant  room  temperature  (25 °C)  (4x2 lamps were 
positioned at left and right sides and 6 lamps were positioned on the top of reactor) . Photo flux was  
measured by Universal Photometer (MRC Model YK -37UVSD) as 5.62  mW  cm-2. The lamps were switched 
off for 15 min as the pre -adsorption process before starti ng the photocatalytic experiment s since 
adsorption -desorption capacities did not vary significantly (<5%) during 2 h of mixing in dark conditions.  
The photocatalytic experiments were carried out in 200 mL treated textile wastewater samples and  pH 
was adjusted to  the desired value s by dosing 1 M NaOH and 1 M H 2SO 4. Experiments were run for 3 h of 
oxidation in accordance with the scientific literature  (Mahmoodi et al ., 2006; Pekakis et al ., 2006; Martins 
et al ., 2006; Gümüş and Akbal, 2011) . While a rang e of 0.5 -2.5 g  l-1 TiO 2 loading was investigated  in the 
WW1 sample,  ZnO catalyst dose var ied from 0.5 to 4.0 g  l-1 in the WW2 sample considering the literature OPTIMIZATION OF SUSPENDED PHOTOCATALYTIC TREATMENT OF TWO BIOLOGICALLY TREATED TEXTILE EFFLUENTS  655 
 studies on textile wastewaters and dyes removal  (De Moraes et al ., 2000;  Mahmoodi et al ., 2006; Pekakis 
et al ., 2006; Martins  et al ., 2006; Gümüş and Akbal, 2011; Lima  et al ., 2015; Fernandez -Ibanez et al ., 2003; 
Pelaez et al ., 2012; Das and Kumar, 2015) .   
During opti mization experiments , 8 mL  of sample were collected at different time intervals and filtered 
through 0.45 µm cellulose acetate membranes (HA, Millipore) to measure soluble COD , TOC  (as DOC)  and 
UV absorbance  parameters.  Experiments were repeated at the optimized conditions in order to obtain 
reproducibility of the results and to collect samples for post toxicity measurements.  
2.4. Ecotoxicity  
Acute toxicity of raw and ph otocatalytic  treated samples was assessed on freshwater c rustaceans Daphnia 
magna (new born daphnids <24 h) according to ISO 6341 Method  (1996) . Toxicity tests were performed 
quadruplicate using fi ve daphnids in each test beaker with 50 ml effective volume. A negative control test 
was run in parallel to control the quality of tes t organisms (<5% of immobilization). Daphnids were grown 
in the laboratory at 16 h day light - 8 h dark periods supplying a 3000 lux illumination at 20°C room 
temperature and  were fed with Selenastrum capricornutum  (300,000 cell  ml-1) an d baker’s yeast 
(Schizosaccharomyces cerevisiae , 200,000 cell s ml-1). Samples were diluted by 50% and set at pH 8. Results 
were expressed as a percentage of immobilised animals after 24 h.  and 48 h according to Eq .1.

2.5. Analysis  
For the aim of wastewater characterization, chemical oxygen demand (COD), Total organic carbon (TOC ) 
and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)  (Shimadzu TOC analyzer (6KVA model ), total suspended and volatile 
solids (TSS and VSS), metals (ICP -OES, Spectro blue Model), conductivity  (WTW Cond 3210 Set 1 (2005 ), 
total khejdahl nitrogen  (Eflab) , ammonia -nitrogen  (Eflab) , alkalinty, and pH (WTW pH 315i ) parameters of 
the effluents wer e determined according to Standard Methods (2005) . Color (German standards , UV 436-
525-620), and aromaticity (UV 254) were also determined by a UV -vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV -
2401).  Residual Zn and Ti concentrations after photocatalytic oxidation experi ments were also measured  
by ICP -OES (ICP -OES, Spectro blue Model) . All analyses and treatment studies were performed at NKU 
Environmental Engineering Department and Central Laboratory (NABİLTEM).  
 
3. Results and discussion  
 
3.1. Wastewater characteristics  
Characterization of secondary treated effluent  samples is given in Table 1. The characteristics of the 
samples varied in wide range by means of COD, TKN and ammonia parameters. A part those WW1 and 
WW2 samples represented the interval of textile finishing industry wastewater  (Villegas -Navarro et al ., 
2001; Meriç et al ., 2005a) , the gradual decrease in almost all parameters from WW1 to WW2 was obtained 
by adding a natural polymer in the biological treatment to control ammonia before discharge. TSS, which 
is an important factor causing light penetration block during photocatalytic oxidation, was still high in 
WW 2 sample (Rizzo et al ., 201 4). The high ratio between VSS/ TSS showed to create a TOC increase 
potential after oxidation in accordance with the other ox idation process application results (Meriç et al , 
2005b).   Total COD of the samples was measured in the order of approximately 1>1/4 from WW1 to WW 2. 
Lower soluble COD content of WW 2 seems to be proportional with its lower visible UV absorbance value 
too. Alkalinity which is another parameter to influence efficiency of photocatalysis process due to the 
hydroxyl radicals scavenger capacity of carbonates (Pelaez  et al ., 2012)  decreased  by 44% from WW1  to 
WW2  sample.  
Unionized ammonia concentration was report ed to be a function of pH (decreases as pH increases) and 
temperature (% increases as temperature increases)  (USEPA, 2002).  Accordingly, ammonia concentration 656  ÇİFÇİ  AND MERİÇ  
 (18-39 mg l-1) measured yields around 0.3 mg  l-1 unionized ammonia concentration at 7 -7.5 pH and 25 °C. 
In the case of the samples studied unionized ammonia concentration was expected to be much lower than 
0.5 mg  l-1 concentration which was reported toxic to D. magna  (Meriç et al ., 2005b). As seen in Ta ble 1, 
both biologically treated samples WW1 and WW2 did not result in toxic when they were tested as 50% 
diluted. However, WW2 tested without dilution was found 55% toxic although it was the least strong 
treated effluent. This is attributed to the other c omponents of the sample which should contain toxic 
organics ( Arslan Alaton et al ., 2002; Correia et al ., 1994; Dulekgurgen et al ., 2007; Eremektar et al ., 2007; 
Khan and Malik, 2014; Meriç et al. , 2005a and b; Sharma et al. , 2007; Selçuk et al ., 2006; Villegas -Navarr o

3.2. Photocatalytic treatment at varying  TiO 2 loadings and pH values  on WW1 sample  
The effect of TiO 2 catalyst concentration on the treatment of WW1 sample  was investigated during 3  h of 
oxidation varying TiO 2 loading  in the range of 0.5 –2.5 g  l-1 and at pH 8 .0 which was as the closest value to 
the original pH of the sample (Fig. 1a). T he increase in the amount of TiO 2 increased versus  COD and UV 254 
removal up to 2  g l-1 TiO 2 concentration and COD and UV 254 removal slightly decreased at 2.5 g  l-1 TiO 2 
concentration. This phenomenon could  be due to the light scattering and reduction in light penetration 
through the  treated textile wastewater  (Pelaez et al ., 2012; Rizzo et al ., 2014). The COD  efficiencies were 
obtained as 21%, 32 %, 43%, and 39% after 3 h of photocatalytic oxidation  using  TiO 2 concentrations of 
0.5, 1, 2, and 2.5  g l-1, respectively . Decolorization was also observed at all TiO 2 concentration s in parallel 
to COD removal .  OPTIMIZATION OF SUSPENDED PHOTOCATALYTIC TREATMENT OF TWO BIOLOGICALLY TREATED TEXTILE EFFLUENTS  657 
 The effect of pH on the performance of the photocatalytic treatment is related to pH PZC of TiO 2 (close to 
6.5-6.8). In basic conditions, TiO 2 surface is negatively charged while the TiO 2 surface is positively charged 
in acidic  solutions. Among the investigated pH values, COD removal  was drastically decrease d at pH 3 and 
11. Furthermore, the decolo rization was not observed at pH 3 and 11.  Maximum COD (49%) and UV 254 
removal (85%) are obtained at pH 5 condition  (Fig. 1b) .  Relatively higher COD removal at pH 5.0 than at 
pH 8 (43%) is at tributed to be still close to  PZC of TiO 2 which was not covered by TSS having negative 
charge to adsorp on TiO 2 nanoparticles (Fernandez -Ibanez et al.,  2003; Pelaez et al.,  2012; Rizzo al., 2 014). 
Furthermore, because of high total COD and VSS values of WW1 (Table 1), a soluble COD contribution 
from the oxidation of VSS could contribute to have low er COD removal than expected (Selçuk et al.,  2006) . 
Besides, c arbonates  could decrease the process efficiency (Rizzo et al ., 201 4; Selçuk et al ., 2011) . As for 
the case of  color removal, UV 436, UV 525 and UV 620 removals were achieved by 35%, 61% and 69% at  
0.5 g  l-1 TiO 2 loading. Color removal increased to 100% at 2 g  l-1 TiO 2 loading during 3 h irridation time  in 
accordance with the highest COD removal  obtained  (Fig. 1b) . According to results shown in Fig.1, the 
optimum TiO 2 concentration for efficient decolorization and COD degradation was concluded to be  
2 g l-1 at pH 5.0 for 3 h oxidation. UV spectra changes of WW1 sample in those conditions are given  in Fig. 
2. After 90 min, decolorization was observed in textile wastewater.

658  ÇİFÇİ  AND MERİÇ  
 In order to determine the kinetics for the reproducibility of TOC, COD and UV 254 removals and toxicity 
optimization the experiments were repeated at optimum oxidation conditions mentioned  above . Fig. 3 
shows that TOC, COD and UV 254 removals increased gradually by time. Removal of efficiencies of TOC and 
COD were found to be 62% and 45% respectively. A slightly lesser COD removal determined in the previous 
experiments can be attributed to the hardne ss of the repeatability of the same conditions during oxidation 
(non -automatic controlled reactor and environmental conditions).  
 
Figure 2 . UV spectra changes of the WW1 sample at 2 g  l-1 TiO 2 dose and pH 5 during 3 h of irradiation 
time  
A higher TOC removal than COD removal should be due to the calculation done on the basis DOC 
measurements in the treated samples because a significant increase of soluble COD occur ed after 
oxidation from decomposition of VSS parameter while DOC may represe nt a lesser portion of that soluble 
content, thus , promoting higher TOC removal in the treated samples. This contribution is well seen  in 
Figure 3 as TOC first decreased after 2 of irradiation time indicating the mineralization of large molecular 
organics which can indicate also the increase of toxicity , and it increased after 3 h due to the contribution 
of new soluble products from VSS destruction. Dearomatization (UV 254 removal) started to increase in 
parallel to TOC and COD removals and it continue to in crease during oxidation reaching around 82% 
removal after 3 h irradiation.

WW1 sample at 2 g  l-1 TiO 2 dose and p H 5 during 3 h irradiation time  
The toxicity increase after 120  min irradiation could be due to the formation of long chain by -products 
after breaking down of aromatic structured chemicals (Meriç et al.,  2005 a; De Moraes  et al., 2000). While

 oxidation continued those by -product should degrade to smaller molecules or more stabilized oxidation 
products which can be related to the not observed immobilization of D. magna  after 180 min. 
photocatalytic degradation  (De Moraes  et al., 2000; Rizzo et al., 2014 ).  
3.3. Photocatalytic treatment of WW2 at varying ZnO loadings and pH values  
The efficiency of ZnO photocatalyst to abate COD and color in WW2 sample was investigated at varying 
ZnO loadings and original pH value of the sample during 3 h irradiation  time . The plot of percent COD and 
UV 254 removals vs. catalyst dose is shown in Fig. 4a . Although a lower COD removal efficienc y than the 
case of TiO 2 use (10-15% ) was obtained  high er removals of UV 436, UV 525 and UV 620 were achieved (73%, 
87% and 82% respectively ) at 2 g  l-1 ZnO loading and pH 9.

(b) 
Figure 4 . Evolution of COD and UV 254 of the WW2 sample at varied ZnO (a) and pH (b) values 
during 4 h photocatalytic oxidation  
While increasing ZnO  concentration, blocking effect of the radiation was observed in the photocatalytic 
degradations (Pelaez et al ., 2012). Dearomatization increased slowly (up to 38% removal) by gradual 
catalytic dose increase up to 2 g  l-1. The effect of pH on the performan ce of the photocatalytic treatment 
660  ÇİFÇİ  AND MERİÇ  
 with ZnO is shown in Fig 4b. The COD and UV 254 removals were not largely influenced by the pH up to pH 
9 (Abdollahi et al ., 2014).  At pH 9, the percent of UV 254 degradation was a significantly increase however 
the COD rem oval was obtained 23% during 3 h irradiation. Figure 5 shows that UV spectra changes of 
textile wastewater with time at 2 g  l-1 ZnO concentration and pH 9.  Since pH of zero point charge for ZnO 
is about 9 and at the pH below 9, surface of ZnO is positivel y charged. To treat the COD and color 
simultaneously, the optimum ZnO concentration and pH were chosen to be 2 g  l-1 and 9, respectively.  As 
shown in Figure 6 a low COD removal of 23% and a higher dearomatization (UV 254 removal) efficiency to 
be 62% were o bserved during repeated experiments at the optimized conditions.   
A slight TOC removal was obtained after 1 h irradiation at which maximum toxicity level was observed. 
This phenomenon can be explained similar to the TiO 2 catalyst based experiments as explained above and 
it is clear to see the results after 90 min  at which both soluble COD and DOC increased, thus their removals 
decreased. UV 254 removal increased in parallel between 90 and 120 min time intervals . Slight toxicity 
observed to D. magna  after 150 min irradiation should indicate the increase of destruction of aromatic 
molecules to mor e toxic long chain by -products (Meriç et al ., 2005b; Pelaez et al ., 2012; Rizzo et al ., 201 4). 
No significant increase of Zn or Ti concentrations was determined in the optimized samples for the 
concern of ecotoxicity to be caused by nanoparticles (Aruoja et al.,  2009) .

3.4. Kinetics  and reuse evaluation  
The photodegradation and decolorization of treated textile wastewater s follow ed pseudo -first order 
kinetics with regression coefficients over 90% , except the case of ZnO experiments ( Table  2).  According 
to photodegradation coefficients, WW2 was found to be less oxidizable by ZnO at the experimental 
conditions.

OPTIMIZATION OF SUSPENDED PHOTOCATALYTIC TREATMENT OF TWO BIOLOGICALLY TREATED TEXTILE EFFLUENTS  661 
 British Textile Technology Team recommended guideline values for reuse of treated textile wastewater 
(BTTG, 1999)  to contain  80 mg  l-1 of COD, 100 mS  cm-1 of conductivity  and 20 Pt -Co of color. An average 
COD removal of 45% obtained at the optimum conditions (2 g  l-1 TiO 2, 5.0 pH, 3 h irradiation) provided an 
effluent COD of 170 mg  l-1which was sufficient for discharge  limits  (<200 mg  l-1) but not for reuse purpose. 
On the other hand, even that low COD removal (23%) obtained at the optimum conditions ZnO catalyst 
application (2 g  l-1 ZnO, pH= 9, 3 h irradiation)  exhibited an effluent COD conce ntration lower than  
70 mg  l-1 meaning that WW2 could be treated properly for reuse . German Federal Ministry of Environment 
published wastewater disc harge limits (2001) for color parameter  by means of absorbance measurements  
which were set as 7-5-3 m-1 for 436 (yellow), 525 (red) and 620 (blue) nm wave bands of sunlight spectr um 
respectively . These absorbance values were respected  by the effluents treated at optimum  condit ions 
using both catalysts  in this study.

4. Conclusion  
 
Photocatalytic oxidation of biologically treated textile wastewaters indicate d that removal rates of TOC, 
COD and color are severely dependent on catalyst concentration and pH. Both TiO 2 and ZnO catalysts 
displayed to provide a satisfying efficiency of decolorization at 2 g  l-1 catal yst loading and 3 h irradiation 
time considering their effective pH values around izoelectrical charge points. Acute toxicity significa ntly 
varied i n both TiO 2 and ZnO treated samples during 3 h irradiation.  Both catalysts were found to be 
effective for complying with strict discharge limits and reuse of treated textile wastewaters.  However, it 
is important to determine the optimum parameters for the degradation of the textile wastewater.
