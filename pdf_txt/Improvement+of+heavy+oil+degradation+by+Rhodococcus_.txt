The most widely distributed environmental pollution can 
be attributed to hydrocarbon contamination, caused by oil tanker accidents, storage tank ruptures, and transport acci-dents. The environment pollution by hydrocarbons at old petrol stations or factory sites is a serious problem as well, as not only does the pollution cause damages to the envi-ronment, but also the sales value of the land decreases sig-niﬁ cantly. Physical technologies, such as combustion and 
solidi ﬁ cation, have been carried out to remove hydrocar-
bons from contaminated soils. Although physical techniques may shorten the work period with low costs, plants are not able to grow in these soils.  It is well known that microbial degradation of spilled hydrocarbons is a major technique in the natural decontamination process
8). Therefore, various 
bacteria degrading hydrocarbons have been isolated, and bioremediation technologies by those bacteria have been investigated
3,4,6,9,11,12).
Fuels are classi ﬁ ed into three classes according to their 
physical and chemical properties (Table1). Petroleum, a complex of individual compounds, and its components are generally grouped into four classes according to their di ﬀ er-
ential solubility in organic solvents; (i) the saturates (n- and branched-chain alkanes and cyclopara ﬃ  ns), (ii) the aromat-
ics (mono-, di-, and polynuclear aromatic compounds con-taining alkyl side chains and/or fused cyclopara ﬃ  n rings), (iii) 
the resins (aggregates with a multitude of building blocks such as pyridines, quinolines, carbazoles, thiophens, sulfox-ides, and amides), and (iv) the asphartenes (aggregates of extended polyaromatics, naphthenic acids, sul ﬁ des, polyhy-
dric phenol, fatty acids, and metallopophyrins)
5). Fuels also 
contain hundreds of complicated compounds (Table 1). An analysis of the hydrocarbon class composition was carried 
out by thin layer chromatography with ﬂ ame ionization 
detection (TLC/FID, IATRON MK-6, Iatron, Tokyo, Japan)
 13).
In our previous study, oil degradable bacteria (especially 
for fuels) were isolated from various places in Japan and assessed to their degradation characteristics for some types of fuel (Aoshima, H. et al ., unpublished results). R. eryth-
ropolis  C2, from Nishinomiya, Hyogo Pref., was found the 
most eﬀ ective for degradation of several types of mineral oil

Rhodococcus erythropolis  C2, which is able to degrade several kinds of fossil fuel, was isolated from soil samples. Oil 
consumption ratios of light oil, heavy oil (type-A), and heavy oil (type-C) of strain C2 were >80%, 80%, and 60%, respec-
tively. The oil consumption ratio of the type-C oil increased by a maximum of 25% depending on the amount of light oil added. The oil consumption ratio of the heavy oil (type-C) was improved by decreasing the viscosity of the oil mixture.   This indicated that the viscosity of the oil compound is an important factor to enhance fuel degradation.

of strain C2 was almost 80% for both light and heavy oil 
(type-A). However, the oil consumption ratio for heavy oil (type-C) of R. erythropolis  C2, had a maximum of 60%, 
and was lower than that for light oil and type-A oil. In order to improve the biodegradability of R. erythropolis  C2 
for heavy oil (type-C), we examined the e ﬀ ects of detergents 
such as food additives and light oil on the biodegradation of heavy oil (type-C).
R. erythropolis  C2 was pre-cultured in 0.5% yeast extract 
at 35°C for 24 h. The pre-culture solution (0.2 ml) was added 
to 20 ml of W medium (2.0 g (NH
4)2SO4, 0.2465 g MgSO4, 
2.78 g FeSO4, 14.7 g, CaCl2, 0.5 g NaCl, 14.3 g Na2HPO4, 
5.44 g KH2PO4, 2.01 g ZnSO4, 0.15 g (NH4) 6Mo7O24, 0.2 g 
CuSO4, 0.4 g CoCl2, 1.49 g MnSO4 per 1 L) containing 
20,000 ppm heavy oil (type-C) and 0 to 20,000 ppm of light oil as sole carbon and energy source or 0.0005% to 0.05% of detergent, and cultured at 120 rpm, at 35°C for 72 h. In order to examine the e ﬀ ectiveness of the detergents, various 
types of Triton-X, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), fatty acid esters, polymer detergents such as casein and carboxy-methyl cellulose were used to enhance the degradability of heavy oil (type-C) by R. erythropolis  C2.
The oil consumption ratio by strain C2 was estimated by 
the weight measurement method after the chloroform-methanol (=3 : 1 v/v) extraction. Chloroform-methanol (18  ml) was added to the culture (20 ml) to extract the remain-ing oil component, and the mixture of solvent and culture was stirred at 120 rpm for 15 min at room temperature.   The mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube and centri-fuged at 6,000× g for 10 min at room temperature. The 
weight of the extracted oil was measured after the lower-layer was collected and the solvent had volatilized for 3 days. Oil consumption ratio was calculated from residual oil components.
Most detergents did not signi ﬁ cantly improve oil degrada-
tion. The growth of strain C2 was inhibited by the addition of Triton-X series and SDS. While strain C2 was able to grow in the fatty acid ester better than that in other deter-gents, fatty acid esters consisting of trehalose slightly im-proved oil degradation. This result suggest that strain C2 might be degrade the fatty acid as a carbon source before the heavy oil compound. The fatty acid ester is structurally similar to the biosurfactant such as trehalose 6, 6'-dimycolate secreted by Rhodococcus  sp
1). Therefore, the fatty acid es-
ter may slightly contribute in forming stable oil-in-water emulsions of heavy oil to promote the indigenous biosurfac-tant of C2. In contrast to detergents, light oils enhanced the heavy oil consumption ratio according to the increased amount of light oil (Table 2). Most of the contents of light oil were saturates and aromatics, which are easily degraded by strain C2. Therefore, the amount of bacteria in a liquid culture containing light oil as a sole carbon source was more numerous than that containing heavy oil (type-C). As a result, light oil increased the production capacity of the biosurfactant. Simultaneously, the biosurfactant was secret-ed into the culture solution and was able to stabilize a heavy oil-in-water emulsion. In addition, this phenomenon can be ascribed to co-oxidation, in which persistent hydro-carbons are oxidized in the presence of hydrocarbons which can serve as growth substrate such as light oil. Evidence for co-oxidation of recalcitrant substrates was provided by as-phaltenes and other aromatic hydrocarbons
2,7). In addition, 
light oil could be helpful to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil, and increase the a ﬃ  nity of heavy oil for the culture so-
lution. Sugiura et al . have investigated the biodegradation 
of four di ﬀ erent crude oil samples, and demonstrated the Table 1. Chemical properties of Light oils and Heavy oils.

biodegradability of crude oil was negatively proportional to 
viscosity10).
The viscosity of each oil sample was determined by a ro-
tary viscometer (type; Programmable DV-III+ Rheometer, Brook ﬁ eld, USA) at 22°C at a shearing rate of 2/sec
2. The 
oil consumption ratio of heavy oil was improved by the de-crease in the viscosity of the oil mixture (Fig. 2). Oil viscosi-ty and the consumption of heavy oil had a negative propor-tional relationship. The equation of the calibration curve was Y=–164.03X+132.85 and the correlation coe ﬃ  cient (r
2) 
was 0.9833. Hence, a reduction in oil viscosity accelerated the degradation ability of heavy oil by strain C2. However, in the case of soil contamination, it is di ﬃ  cult for bacteria 
to attach to the solidi ﬁ ed oil components after weathering.   
In order to improve the e ﬀ ectiveness of the contact between 
solidi ﬁ ed oil and bacteria, dissolution of solidi ﬁ ed oil by 
light oil will be the e ﬀ ective method to encourage the oil 
degradation in soil environment.
In this study, the relationship between fuel degradation 
and viscosity was demonstrated
14). It is highly possible that 
the reduction of viscosity of polluted oils contributes to ac-celerate degradation of contaminated soil environments. To further elucidate the advantage of lower oil viscosity for bacteria, we started to analyze the amount of bacteria un-der various viscosities. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
