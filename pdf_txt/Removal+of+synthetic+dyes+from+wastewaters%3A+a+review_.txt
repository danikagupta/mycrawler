ABSTRACT : The existence of various types of industries in Malaysia, making it the country's fastest -growing 
emerging in Asia. There are many industries that use the latest technology such as the use of synthetic dyes for 
the textile, leather tanning, pape r and pulp as well as in the food industry. In Malaysia, the textile industry is the 
most widespread industrial use dyes as a  fibre colouring. However, a variety of synthetic dyestuff released by 
the textile industry has been posing a threat to the safety of the environment caused by the presence of a large 
number of toxic contaminants such as organic waste, acids, bases and organic pollutants. Therefore, the 
authorities began to control the pollution created by the industry to tighten the regulation and en forcement by 
forcing the industry to treat waste before discharge to the environment. There are many methods have been used 
to treat this waste. However, it requires a treatment that really works not only at low cost with require minimal 
or no pre -treatmen t at all, but it must also be environmentally friendly, minimum sludge production and cleaner. 
This study used biological method to explore the usability of the microorganisms i.e. bacteria, Lactobacillus 
delbruckii for the removal of dyes from aqueous sol utions. It involves the use of two commercial synthetic dyes 
i.e. Reactive orange 16(RO 16)  and Reactive black 5(RB 5) . The effects of different parameters such as pH, 
temperature and initial dye concentration were studied and the effectiveness of this met hod to remove the dye 
solution was determined by measuring the percentage of colour removal. The results showed that the bacteria 
are able to decolorize this two reactive dyes and the optimum pH, temperature and initial dye concentration  
were found to be  10 ppm, 6 and 37 °C, respectively. Therefore, Lactobacillus delbruckii is a tremendous 
potential strain for decolourization of reactive textile dye effluent, and it can be used as a practical alternative 
in the treatment of textile wastewater to achieve effl uents that congregate the  Malaysian emissions standards.

I. INTRODUCTION  
     Color is the most visible pollutant that can be easily recognized in wastewater and it should be treated 
properly before discharging into water bodies or on land. The presence of color in wastewater either in industrial 
or domestics needs is considered as the most undesirable. Besides, the occurrence of various coloring agents like 
dyes, inorganics pigments, tannins and lignin which usually impart color          [1] become among the main 
contributor for these environmental  matter with dyes wastes are predo minant. Dyes are widely used in many 
industries such as textile dyeing, food, cosmetics, paper printing, leather and plastics, with textiles industry is 
the major consumer.  The number of synthetic dyes presently utilizes in textile industry is about 10 000 , 
representing an annual consumption of around 7x105 tonnes worldwide  [2]. Synthetic dyes were classified based 
on their chromophores and it can be divided into several groups such as azo, anthraquinone, sulphur, indigod, 
triphenymehyl and phthalocya nine d erivatives [3] . Moreover, azo dyes are the most important class of 
commercial dye and versatile colorants which have been used excessively in industries worldwide due to their 
wide variety of color shades, high wet fastness profiles [4], ease and cost effe ctiveness compare d to natural dyes 
[5].   
     Typically, dyes wastewater are the most problematic to be treated due to their chemical stability, high 
chemical oxygen demand (COD), toxic and some of these dyes are suspected as carcinogen s [6]. Fahmi (2010)  
have reported that, the presence even on a very small portion of dyes in water bodies is highly noticeable by 
human eye and alters the aquatic ecosystem by reducing the penetration of sunlight  [7]. Previously, there are 
many researchers have summarized a number of studies on physicochemical method for the removal of dyes 
from wastewater such as coagulation and flocculation [8] , advance d oxidation [1] , activated carbon [6] , Removal of Synthetic Dyes from Wastewater by Using Bacteria, Lactobacillus delbruckii  
www.irjes.com                                                    2 | Page  ozonation an d photocatalysis[9]. Eventhough  these methods are effective in dye removal but several drawbacks  
are either costly to apply in industries or produce secondary sludge, limits t heir application [10] . By these 
reason, currently more researchers have been focusing their studies on exploring  the alternatives approaches on 
color removal from dye wastewater.  
     In recent years, a wide range of studies have raising a enormous attention on biological methods with 
some microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and algae [11] are highly capable to biodegrade and biosorb dyes 
wastewater. The application of microorganisms for dye wastewater removal offer considerable advantages such 
as the process is relatively low cost, environmental friendly, produce less secondary sludge and the end products 
of com plete mineralizati on are not toxic [3] . Numerous research works has been conducted and proven the 
potential of microorganisms such as Cunninghamella elegans  [12], Aspergillus niger  [2], Bacillus cereus [13], 
Chlorella sp . [14] and also Citrobacter sp.  [4] on dye wastewater removal. The adaptability and the activity of 
each microorganism are the most significant factors that influence the effectiveness of mic robial decolorization 
[15]. Hence, in order to develop a practical bioprocess for the dye wastewater treatment, it is compulsory to 
continuously investigate microorganisms th at capable to degrade azo dyes.  
     Therefore, this paper puts forward the potential of a bacterial strain, Lactobacillus delbruckii  on dye 
wastewater treatment and evaluates their capability on decolorizing the dye solution. Lately, there are a few 
reports about lactic acid bacteria ability to degrade azo dyes has been published. Previous study by Phisit et al. 
(2007) had proved that Lactobacillus casei able to  decolorize an azo dye  with the optimum pH at pH 6  [5]. 
Besides, Cervantes and Santos (2011) have summarized that, the first studies documenting the bacterial 
reduction of azo dyes were reported on lactic acid bacteria by Brohm and Frohwein since 1937  [16]. Generally, 
Lactobaci llus delbrueckii is under groups of bacteria and the genus Lactobacillus  which contains a diverse 
assemblage of 140 species. Beyond that, Lactobacillus includes gram -positive, catalyse negative, non -motile, 
non-sporulating, and facultative anaerobes  [17]. The genus  Lactobacillus is one of the largest groups of lactic 
acid bacteria used in food fermentation proce sses [18]  and mostly us ed in the production of yoghurt [19] . In 
addition, the effects of various parameters (such as temperature, pH and initial dye concentration) on dye 
decolorization by  Lactobacillus delbruckii  were also investigated.

Lactobacillus Delbruckii subsp. Lactis ATCC: 12315 with the a bility of degrading azo dyes were used 
throughout this study. Stock cultures were stored at – 20°C in 20% glycerol. In degradation studies, the 
organism is grown under anaerobic condition within 48 hours at its optimum temperature, 37°C and pH around 
4.6 til 5.4 where maintained routinely. The used medium, MRS Broth was composed in     1000 ml of distilled 
water; containing [(g l ־¹): peptone from case in 10.0, meet extract 10.0, yeast extract (4.0), D+ Glucose 20.0, di -
Potassium hydrogen phosphate 2.0, Tween 80 (1.0), di -Ammonium hydrogen Citrate 2.0, Sodium Acetate 5.0, 
Magnesium Sulfate 0.2, Manganesesulfate 0.04].  
 
2.3 Measurement of dye concentration  
The dye concentrations were measured with a spectrophotometer UV-vis (Uviline 9400, SECOMAM) at 
intervals during the decolorization process. The concentration dye was detected by spectrophotometer by 
reading the culture supernatant at specific maximum abso rbance wavelength, λ max after centrifugation (10, 000 
rpm, 4°C for 20 mins). The efficiency of color removal was determined by the following equation: Color 
removal (%) = Ci - Cf / C i × 100%, where C i and C f were initial and final concentrations, respectiv ely.  
 
2.4 Decolorization of azo dyes by Lactobacillus delbruckii  
The ability of bacterial decolorization of two azo dyes with different molecular structure ( RO 16    and RO 
5) was investigated to compare their biodegradability. In order to evaluate the ef fects of environmental factors, 
such as pH (3 -8, 37 °C, 50 ppm ), temperature (30 °C – 42°C, pH 7, 50 ppm ) and initial dye concentrations (10 – 
100 ppm, pH 7, 37 °C ) on bacterial decolorization were investigated. The required pH was adjusted by 1 mol 
NaOH or 1 mol HCl while dye concentrations was measured using spectrophotometer UV -vis at a wavelength 
corresponding to the maximum absorbance of each dye. The dye solution at desired concentration, pH and 
temperature taken in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks was contacte d. The flasks were  sterilized before incubated and  
kept under agitation in a rotating orbital shaker at 150 rpm and 37°C for desired time. Samples (5 ml) were 
withdrawn at regular time intervals and analyzed for color removal. All the experiments were cond ucted 
triplicate and the values of data are presented.  
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
3.1   Initial time course studies  
 Regarding on  the adsorption kinetics, it was discovered that contact time influnced the biosorption of 
RO 16 and RB 5. Fig. 1 shows the results of initial time course on decolorization of RO 16 and RB 5 by 
Lactobacillus delbrueckii . Based on the results, the maximum de colorization for both reactive dyes were  
recorded  at the 48 hours of incubation time at pH 6 and 37°C . The maximum rate of color removal of RB 5 
(51%) kept on enhancing within first 48 hours and no further decolorization occured to 72 hours. However, 
maxim um decolorization of RO 16 (57%) by  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  followed almost the same pattern as 
decolorization of RB 5 but  have slightly increasing in color removal during 48 hours till 72 hours of incubation 
under the same conditions. Sandra (2012) had stated that, the length of contact time can influenced the 
biosorption ability and it can be vary in accordance with properties of the dye and the activity of the 
microoragnisms [12]. This statement is substantiated by the results achieved in our study usi ng Lactobacillus 
delbrueckii . As a conclusion, the maximum decolorization of the RO 16 and RB 5 were at 48 hours, thus, this 
optimum time period was used for the subsequent experiments.

3.2   Effects of pH on dye decolorization  
 The study evaluated the effects of pH on the de colorization of RO 16 and RB 5 over a wide range of 
pH (3.0 –8.0) after 48 hours cultivation . The influnce of pH on adsorption o f the two dyes is shown in Fig. 2. For 
both dyes, the best color removal was achieved at pH 6 with 60% for RO 16 and 53% for RB 5, respectively. 
The data presented were associated with study by Hui (2009), the optimal pH for color removal is often between 
6.0-10.0 [4].  Thus, for further studies, the optimum pH was adopted at pH 6. Moreover, as the pH was increased 
from pH 5.0 to 6.0, the percent removal of RO 16 was increased from 52% to 60%. However, rate of 
decolorization decreased at lower pH (3.0 –4.0) a nd also at higher pH  (7.0 –9.0). The results showed the similar 
pattern for RB 5 decolorization with the rate of decolorization increased from pH 5.0 to 6.0 with the percent 
removal increased from 33% to 53% whereas the rate of color removal were much lowe r at strongly acidic (3.0 –
4.0) or strongly alkaline (8.0 –9.0) conditions. According to Phisit et al. (2007) study, maximum decolorization 
of Methyl orange by Lactobacillus  casei strain TISTR 1500 was found to completely degrade at pH 6 [5]. 
Besides, the co nsortium containing bacterial cultures P. Polymyxa , M. Luteus and Micrococcus  sp. exhibit good 
decolorization ability in mixed form with ability to decolorize various dyes at pH from 6.5 to 8.5 has also been 
reported [20]. The pH tolerance of decolorizing dye by bacteria is important because azo dyes bind to cotton 
fibers by addition or substitution mechanisms under alkaline conditions and at high temperature [4]. Therefore, 
the results clearly indicate that decolorization of both reactive dyes by Lactobaci llus delbrueckii  were 
significantly affected by the pH value of the dye and acidic pH was favourable for the adsorption for both the 
dyes.

During color removal of RO 16 and RB 5 by Lactobacillus delbruckii , the temperature was significant 
effect on the decolorization efficiency for both dyes. Based on Fig. 3, the decolorization  of the dyes was tested 
for wide range of temperature from 30°C  to 42°C. It was observed that  the optimum temperature for RO 16 and 
RB 5 were at 37°C , with 63% and 55%  color removal , respectively. Besides, increase in decolorization  of RO 
16 and RB 5 were sequentially with increase of temperature from 30°C to 37°C, the percent removal of RO 16 
and RB 5 was increased from 46% to 63% and 45% to 55%, respectively. However, when further increase in the 
temperature above the optimum condi tions (37°C),             a decreased in both dye decolorization were noticed 
and decolorizing activity was significantly suppressed from 37 °C to 42 °C. According to Anjaneya (2011) study, 
a decrease in dye decolorization at high temperature because decline  in microbial activity that lead to the 
inactivation of the enzyme and loss the cell viability [21].

3.3   Effects of initial dye on dye decolorization  
             The percentage decolorization of RO 16 and RB 5 by Lactobacillus delbruckii  was carried out at 
different initial dye concentrations (10 ppm -100 ppm) and Fig. 4 shows the effect of initial dye concentration on 
dye removal  of RO 16  and RB 5 by bacteria. The microbes could effectively decolorize RO 16 and RB 5 with 
decolorization percentage of 46% and 49%  for 10 ppm, respectively. Besides, it was observed that decrease in 
percentage color removal  of RO 16 and RB 5 by Lactobacillus delbruc kii until only 27% and 31% removal, 
respectively with increase in concentration condition . According to Anjaneya (2011)  , lower decolorization 
percentage at high dye concentration was reported and it was expected to happen because the inhibitory effects 
of high dye concentrations [21]. Initial concentration provides a significant driving force to overcome all mass 
transfer resistances of the dye between the aqueous and solid phases  and thus, this suggests that initial dye 
concentration affected both dye dec olorization percentages.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  
     The results obtained from this work showed that bacteria species, Lactobacillus delbruckii possessed 
impressive decolorization efficiency. ]The color removal was dependent on the dye concentration, pH and 
temperature and the optimal conditions for dye removal were 10 ppm, 6 and 37°C, respectively.  It can be 
concluded that, Lactoba cillus d elbruck ii is the highly promising and suitable microorganisms to use in the 
treatment of solution containing dye. However, more studies are essential prior to employing this method 
commercially in the real textile industry
