The microbiome is an underappreciated contributor to intestinal drug metabolism with
broad implications for drug efficacy and toxicity. While considerable progress has been
made towards identifying the gut bacterial genes and enzymes involved, the role of
environmental factors in shaping their activity remains poorly understood. Here, we
focus on the gut bacterial reduction of azo bonds (R-N=N-R’), found in diverse
chemicals in both food and drugs. Surprisingly, the canonical azoR gene in Escherichia
coli was dispensable for azo bond reduction. Instead, azo reductase activity was
controlled by the fumarate and nitrate reduction (fnr) regulator, consistent with a
requirement for the anoxic conditions found within the gastrointestinal tract. Paired
transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the fnrregulon revealed that in addition to
altering the expression of multiple reductases, FNR is necessary for the metabolism of
L-Cysteine to hydrogen sulfide, enabling the degradation of azo bonds. Taken together,
these results show how gut bacteria sense and respond to their intestinal environment
to enable the metabolism of chemical motifs found in both dietary and pharmaceutical
compounds.
IMPORTANCE
This work has broad relevance due to the ubiquity of dyes containing azo bonds in food
and drugs. We report that azo dyes can be degraded by human gut bacteria through
both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms, even from a single gut bacterial
species. Furthermore, we revealed that environmental factors, oxygen and cysteine,
control the ability of E. coli to degrade azo dyes due to their impacts on bacterial
transcription and metabolism. These results open up new opportunities to manipulate
the azoreductase activity of the gut microbiome through the manipulation of host diet,
suggest that azoreductase potential may be altered in patients suffering from
gastrointestinal disease, and highlight the importance of studying bacterial enzymes for
drug metabolism in their natural cellular and ecological context..

INTRODUCTION
While it has long been appreciated that the gut microbiota, the trillions of
microorganisms found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and its aggregate genomes (the
gut microbiome) contribute to the digestion and metabolism of dietary macronutrients,
the broader role of the microbiome in the metabolism of xenobiotics (diet-derived and
pharmaceutical small molecules) is less well understood. Recently, work in cell culture,
mice, and humans have emphasized that both excipients (food and drug additives) and
pharmaceuticals are extensively metabolized by the gut microbiota (1–6). The presence
of an azo bond (R-N=N-R’) is shared between both pharmaceuticals and excipients (7,
8), which is notable given the ability of diverse human gut bacteria to reduce azo bonds
(9). While azo reductase activity may be a core metabolic function of all human gut
microbiotas (10–14), the enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms responsible for this
activity and their sensitivity to environmental factors remain poorly understood.
Mechanistic insights into this process are essential given the broad impact of azo
reduction for antibiotics (15) and anti-inflammatory drugs (7, 16). Furthermore, the
consumption of food, drug, and cosmetic (FD&C) dyes is increasing (17), providing
additional substrates for gut bacterial metabolism. We recently discovered that FD&C
dyes are potent inhibitors of the influx transporter OATP2B1, interfering with drug
absorption in gnotobiotic mice (18). This effect was rescued by human gut bacterial
metabolism due to an inability of the downstream microbial metabolites to inhibit
OATP2B1 (18). Additional work in rodent models has implicated FD&C dyes in
carcinogenesis (19–21) and inflammatory bowel disease (22). Thus, the ability to predict
or control azo reductase potential within the human gut microbiome could have broad
implications for host health and disease.
The canonical enzyme implicated in this metabolic activity is azo reductase
(AzoR) (9, 11, 14, 23). Work on the model human gut bacterium Escherichia coli has
demonstrated that the purified AzoR protein is sufficient to reduce azo bonds (24). For.

multiple azo reductases. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed for azo
reductase activity, including the electron transport chain of Shewanella oneidensis,
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) (32–34) .While
these studies provide valuable mechanistic insight, a major limitation is their focus on in
vitro biochemistry, neglecting to address the cellular and genetic mechanisms that
impact azo reductase activity or the potential confounding effects of the complex
physiological and microbiological interactions within the GI tract.
We sought to address this knowledge gap through the mechanistic dissection of
a representative member of the human gut microbiota. Surprisingly, we found that the
azoR gene is dispensable for the azo reductase activity of E. coli. In our search for
alternative azoreductase enzymes, we discovered that E. coli azo reduction is regulated
by the oxygen-sensing dual-transcriptional regulator, FNR. In turn, we discovered that
FNR regulates L-Cysteine metabolism, which produces H 2S. Surprisingly, E.
coli-produced H 2S is sufficient to reduce azo dyes and drugs. Taken together, we
demonstrate that environmental oxygen regulates the metabolism of L-Cysteine to H 2S
which degrades commonly consumed azo-bonded compounds. Our results highlight the
importance of studying and developing an understanding of the environmental context
and regulation of key microbial metabolisms beyond annotated enzyme function.
RESULTS
E. coli AzoR is dispensable for azoreductase function. Prior work from our
lab (18, 35) and others (36) has identified widespread homologous genes to E. coli azo
reductase (AzoR) in the genomes of human gut bacteria capable of metabolizing
diverse compounds containing azo bonds. We had originally sought to establish a
tractable system to study these heterologously expressed genes by first abolishing this
activity in E. coli. Much to our surprise, the E. coli Keio collection azoreductase
knockout strain (ΔazoR) had activity indistinguishable from wild-type (wt) during growth
in both solid (Figure 1A) and liquid (Figure 1B) media containing a representative azo
bond-containing food coloring (FD&C Red No. 40). We validated this finding by.

gel electrophoresis ( Figure S1A) and Sanger sequencing (Figure S1B).
Given these unexpected results, we wondered if AzoR might be inactive in the
tested E. coli strains, potentially due to mutations that could have occured during the
creation of our lab’s culture collection (37). Sanger sequencing of the azoR gene
verified that the coding sequence was 100% identical to the deposited E. coli BW25113
genome. To further validate the activity of this enzyme, we purified the Histidine-tagged
AzoR protein from E. coli AG1 with the pCA24N plasmid for overexpression (ASKA
collection) (38). Cells were grown to mid-exponential growth phase, azoR expression
was induced with Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), then cells were
harvested, and protein was purified using a nickel-charged affinity column. The fraction
location of the protein was determined using an SDS-PAGE gel and the size of the
protein was consistent with AzoR (Figure S2A). As expected, the purified protein was
sufficient to clear a panel of azo bond containing dyes and drugs (Figure S2B).
Additionally, we were able to create a Michaelis-Menten curve describing the enzymatic
activity against FD&C Red No. 40, where we calculated a K Mof 67.7μM (Figure 1D).
Finally, we tested our whole cell assay using a panel of 10 food additives and
pharmaceutical compounds containing azo bonds, demonstrating that azoR is
unnecessary for the depletion of multiple dyes (Figure 1E). These results confirm that
the canonical AzoR enzyme in E. coli (24) is sufficient for azo reductase activity;
however, azoR is not required for azo bond reduction by E. coli cells, emphasizing that
biochemical activity of purified proteins is not necessarily predictive of metabolism in
whole cells and motivating a renewed search for the mechanism(s) responsible.
FNR is necessary for the in vitro azoreductase activity of E. coli. To identify
genes necessary for azo dye depletion, we screened 115 candidate gene deletions from
the Keio collection using a high-throughput liquid media assay for the depletion of the
widely used food coloring FD&C Red No. 40. Target genes were chosen based on
previously published literature. First, work with a transposon mutagenesis library of
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 demonstrated that the electron transport chain is involved
in azo dye depletion (39). Homologs of these genes were identified in E. coli and tested.

Additionally, Zhang et al. tested gene expression in E. coli that were
bound to a quinone and exposed to azo dyes (40). Genes that were upregulated when
exposed to azo compound, annotated as involved in electron transport, or annotated as
reductases were also added to the hits tested here. Target gene annotations were cross
referenced on EcoCyc (41) before testing (Table S1). Consistent with our previous data
(Figure 1), ΔazoR was comparable to wt(Figure 2A, Table S1). A stringent cutoff of
95% confidence interval of all genes tested revealed 22 gene deletions that had
significantly impaired activity (Figure 2A). The most dramatic loss-of-function was found
for Δfnr (fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator) resulting in a 2.3-fold decrease in azo
dye depletion. We validated the role of fnrin FD&C Red No. 40 depletion by
constructing a clean deletion (Figure 2B) then confirming the deletion by gel
electrophoresis (Figure S1C) and Sanger sequencing (Figure S1D). Activity was
restored through complementation of fnron the pCA24N plasmid from the ASKA
collection (38) (Figure 2C).
FNR plays a key role in oxygen sensing and the transition to anaerobic
metabolism (42, 43). Consistent with this, FD&C Red No. 40 depletion was significantly
greater under anaerobic conditions (Figure 2D). The requirement for fnrwas not unique
to FD&C Red No. 40; significantly decreased dye depletion was observed across a
panel of 7 food dyes and 3 azo bond-containing drugs (Figure S3). Overexpression of
AzoR was insufficient to rescue Δfnr (Figure 2C), suggesting that other aspects of the
vast fnrregulon (44–47) are responsible for the observed phenotype and/or permeability
issues result in inadequate dye reaching AzoR in the cytosol (48).
The FNR-dependent regulators cyuR and crpcontribute to azoreductase
potential. While prior studies have extensively characterized the FNR regulon (43, 44,
46, 49), they were performed in different growth conditions and in the absence of azo
dyes, motivating us to revisit these results using paired transcriptomics and proteomics
(Figure 3A). We grew wtand Δfnr E. coli in Luria Broth (LB) media and inoculated the
cultures with 250 µM FD&C Red No. 40 at either mid-exponential or stationary growth
phases. After a 40-minute incubation period, samples were collected and split for paired
transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and proteomics analysis. In total, we generated 12.4±6.2.

matching spectra through the MSGF+ database (50) and adjusting for false discovery
rate of 0.01 against the MSGF generated decoy database  (proteomics; Table S3).
Principal coordinates analysis revealed a clear separation of profiles between
strains at the RNA (Figure 3B) and protein (Figure 3C) levels. As expected (51–53), we
also saw a clear difference in expression profile between growth phases; however, the
separation between strains was maintained at both timepoints (Figure 3B,C). There
was a more minimal impact of FD&C Red No. 40 ( Figure 3B,C).
To identify differentially expressed genes that could account for the observed
differences in azo reductase potential, we modeled the complex interaction between
growth phase, strain, and treatment (Figure 3D-E, Table S4). Specifically, we continued
our analyses using the differences found using the strain contrast since so few features
were significantly different when taking all conditions contrasts into account. Consistent
with the low signal for treatment, the contrast for FD&C Red No. 40 only gave one
significantly depleted protein, Flagellar Hook Protein (FlgE). For transcriptomics, we
identified 219 significantly upregulated features at FD&C Red No. 40 contrast (p adj<0.1);
however, we decided to move forward with the strain contrast so that transcriptomics
and proteomics datasets could be compared. In total, we identified 506 (RNA) and 133
(protein) differentially expressed features between strains (log 2fold-change>|1|, padj<0.1;
Figure 3F,G). 83 of these features were consistently differentially expressed in the
same direction in both datasets (Figure 3H), including 63 annotated enzymes and 11
annotated reductases (Table S5). Of note, azoR was slightly significantly upregulated in
thewtstrain (Figure S4A), with a trend towards increased peptide intensity (Figure
S4B). As expected, fnrtranscripts were undetectable in the Δfnr strain (Figure S4C).
To further narrow down the subsets of the fnrregulon involved in azo reductase
activity, we searched for additional regulators in our list of differentially expressed
genes. Features that were significantly upregulated in both RNA-seq and proteomics in
wtcompared to Δfnr (log 2fold-change> |1|, padj<0.1) were analyzed for direct regulators
using EcoCyc (see Methods). This analysis revealed 11 regulators whose regulons
were significantly enriched in our gene set (Figure 3I). Reassuringly, fnrwas the most
significantly enriched regulator. We went on to test the azoreduction phenotype of Keio.

Two regulators that were not in our
original screen, cyuR (detoxification of L-Cysteine regulator) and crp(cAMP-activated
global transcriptional regulator), demonstrated a significant loss-of-function compared to
wt(p<0.0001, one-way ANOVA). Crp regulates >100 genes during both aerobic and
anaerobic growth (54–57). In contrast, cyuR regulates just two genes involved in
L-Cysteine metabolism: cyuA (L-Cysteine desulfidase) and cyuP (L-Cysteine utilization
permease) (58–60). Given the tractable size of the cyuR regulon and emerging
evidence that L-Cysteine metabolism can enable degradation of azo bonds (34, 61, 62),
we opted to focus on cyuA andcyuP.
FNR-dependent L-Cysteine metabolism is required for degradation of azo
bonds. L-Cysteine metabolism by E. coli generates hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) as a
dead-end metabolite (Figure 4A) (59, 63), which has been previously implicated in azo
dye degradation (34, 61, 62). Thus, we hypothesized that fnrcontrols H 2S production
and thus azo bond degradation by increasing the expression of the cyuR-regulated
cyuA and cyuP. First, we tested the requirements for L-Cysteine and H 2S in
azoreduction. To maintain anaerobic conditions, we routinely supplement our media with
L-Cysteine (64–66). Removal of L-Cysteine impaired the ability of E. coli to clear FD&C
Red No. 40 (Figure 4B). L-Cysteine promoted FD&C Red No. 40 depletion in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C), suggesting that L-Cysteine is a key substrate for
azo reductase activity during in vitro growth under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic
conditions in LB media lacking L-Cysteine, equilibrated in the anaerobic chamber for
one week were confirmed by eye using the indicator resazurin. Notably, L-Cysteine
alone was unable to deplete FD&C Red No. 40 (Figure 4D), while addition of sodium
sulfide demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in sterile media (Figure 4E). To test
the relationship between L-Cysteine and H 2S, we quantified H 2S in whole cell culture
using the methylene blue assay (see Methods). H 2S levels were below our limit of
detection (1.3 µM) in the Δfnr strain, significantly less than the triple-digit µM levels
produced by wt(Figure 4F). We also quantified the amount of FD&C Red No. 40
depleted in these samples and saw the inverse trend ( Figure 4G )..

for FD&C Red No. 40 depletion. We utilized single and multi-gene knockouts for the
cyuR regulon. As previously mentioned, cyuR regulates both the L-Cysteine transporter,
cyuP and L-Cysteine desulfurase, cyuA (59) (Figure 5A). Consistent with our
hypothesis, both cyuA andcyuP were significantly decreased at the transcript level in
Δfnr E. coli relative to wtcontrols (Figure 5B). cyuR was also significantly increased at
the transcript level (Figure S4D). The cyuP and cyuR knockout strains produced
significantly less sulfide (Figure 5C) and depleted significantly less FD&C Red No. 40
(Figure 5D) in L-Cysteine-containing media. The combined deletion of cyuR andazoR
did not significantly impact sulfide levels (Figure 5E); however, there was a slight but
statistical significance impairment in azo dye depletion ( Figure 5F ).
DISCUSSION
Our results provide mechanistic insight into the degradation of azo dyes by
human gut bacteria. Surprisingly, the canonical azoreductase enzyme of E. coli is
dispensable for whole cell azoreductase activity. Instead, the shift to anaerobic growth is
critical. We dissected a pathway through which oxygen is sensed by FNR, leading to
upregulation of the cyuoperon, increased uptake of L-Cysteine, enhanced production of
H2S, and non-enzymatic azo bond reduction ( Figure 6).
These findings provide a cautionary tale for the ability to extrapolate results from
biochemical studies of purified proteins to infer the metabolic activity of cells and
complex microbial communities. Despite a rich literature on E. coli AzoR (24, 48, 67),
we found that the azoR gene is dispensable for azo reduction by E. coli during
anaerobic growth. These findings emphasize the importance of pairing biochemical and
heterologous expression studies of enzyme function with methods for gene deletion in
the original strain. Future work should extend this approach to the other bacterial
species with biochemically characterized azoreductase enzymes (25, 29, 68, 69). For
species where genetic tools do not exist (the vast majority of human gut bacteria), one
could leverage natural strain-level variation to test the association between gene
presence and sequence variation with metabolic activity (37)..

It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted October 25, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.25.513779doi: bioRxiv preprint We found that the global regulator FNR is essential for E. coli azoreduction,
highlighting the importance of environmental oxygen for the gut bacterial metabolism of
drugs and excipients. Confirming the prior work on FNR in different growth conditions
(42, 57), we found that the FNR regulon is vast, including hundreds of genes involved in
different aspects of anaerobic metabolism. Interestingly, efforts to utilize bacterial
azoreduction to degrade dye runoff in water systems also require anaerobic conditions,
suggesting that our findings may be generalizable to microbial communities outside of
the human gut (23, 70, 71). Importantly, E. coli exhibits features of both aerobic and
anaerobic growth within the GI tract (57, 72), depending upon its physical niche and
host pathophysiology (73, 74). Our results suggest that inter-individual variations in the
environment in which E. coli grows could have downstream consequences for its ability
to act upon azo bond containing compounds. More work is necessary to assess how the
redox potential of the gut lumen and other environmental factors shape gut bacterial azo
reduction in the context of host health and disease.
Surprisingly, we found that FNR controls azo reductase potential through the
reduction of azo bonds by H 2S. Given that L-Cysteine is the major source of H 2S for E.
coli, these results provide an additional layer of environmental control for azoreduction.
Differences in dietary protein, host proteoglycans, and/or L-Cysteine biosynthesis by
other members of the gut microbiota could all potentially influence the activity of E. coli
and its ability to act on azo bonds. Future studies leveraging gnotobiotic mice, defined
dietary interventions, and isotope tracing could be informative in this regard.
Our results indicate that the L-Cysteine utilization regulator cyuR, among others,
is under FNR control, emphasizing the complex multi-level regulatory network
contributing to bacterial azoreduction. The cyuoperon is the main source for L-Cysteine
import and metabolism by E. coli (59, 75). We also found that H 2S production requires
cyuR. Interestingly, we found that the L-Cysteine uptake transporter, CyuP, was more
important than the enzyme CyuA, suggesting that the import of L-Cysteine could
provide substrate for additional pathways for H 2S production. CyuA only functions
anaerobically (59), consistent with our observations that azoreduction only occurs
anaerobically and is regulated by FNR and CyuR. Moreover, the key role of L-Cysteine
import suggests that amino acid availability from diet and/or host tissues could be.

Future studies with mouse models and various
dietary amino acid interventions could provide an opportunity to modulate microbiome
azoreductase activity.
Deletion of both cyuR andazoR did not fully abolish E. coli azoreduction. Thus,
additional pathways for L-Cysteine metabolism and/or as-of-yet undiscovered
enzyme(s) may contribute to the metabolism of azo dyes by E. coli. In our initial screen,
we found 22 deletion strains with a partial loss-of-function phenotype, all of which
encode enzymes theoretically capable of azo reduction. Of these, 4 were also identified
in our paired proteomic and transcriptomic dataset (Table S6), providing viable
candidates for further biochemical characterization and/or complementation screens in
the Δfnr background.
H2S production is widespread throughout gut bacterial species (76), suggesting
that far more bacterial taxa are capable of azo reduction than previously appreciated.
L-Cysteine can be made from a variety of different sources, thus methionine and other
sulfur starting points could impact the gut microbiota’s H 2S production capacity. Multiple
Desulfovibrio species found in the GI tract can reduce sulfate to H 2S (77–80). Thus, GI
levels of H 2S represent the net effect of multiple distinct pathways, which will be
important to consider when translating these results into humans. As a first step, studies
in gnotobiotic mice with defined microbial communities representing distinct
assemblages of H 2S producers would help to better understand the relative importance
of each species for azo dye degradation under different dietary and host selection
pressures.
There are multiple limitations of this study. We focused entirely on the model gut
Proteobacterium E. coli due to its genetic tractability and long history of molecular
research; however, the generalizability of the pathway we described to other gut
bacteria remains unclear. The development of genetic tools that permit similar
mechanistic dissections into these more exotic gut bacteria will be essential for studying
the conservation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic azo bond degradation in diverse gut
bacterial species. The physiological relevance of our findings remains unclear, requiring
more work in mice or other preclinical models. It will also be important to test the clinical
relevance of these findings in the context of diseases intentionally treated with azo bond.

potentially be exacerbated by dietary exposures to azo dyes. Our results emphasize
that in addition to metagenomics, it will be critical to measure key environmental factors
in human clinical cohorts like oxygen and amino acid levels.
Despite these limitations, our results clearly emphasize the importance of
environmental factors in controlling a clinically relevant metabolic activity of the human
gut microbiome. These experiments are particularly timely given the rapid increase in
food dye intake due to their incorporation in processed foods (81) and emerging
evidence that they have unintended consequences for gut epithelial (18) and immune
(22) cells. Continued progress towards dissecting the mechanisms responsible for this
metabolic activity in E. coli and other experimentally tractable gut bacterial species is a
key step towards predicting and controlling the location and extent of azo dye
metabolism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, media, and chemicals. Bacterial strains used in this study
are listed in Table S7. E. coli was grown in Lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with
0.05% L-Cysteine under anaerobic conditions at 37°C unless otherwise noted.
L-Cysteine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Assaying whole cell E. coli depletion of azo compounds. Cultures were
grown in Luria Broth (LB) medium supplemented with 250 μM of azo dye and 0.05%
L-Cysteine. Azo dye stocks were prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 25 mM and
used at a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Cultures were incubated at 37°C. All
incubations were performed in a COY Laboratory Products Inc anaerobic chamber
(Grass Lake, MI) with the following atmosphere: 10% H 2, 5% CO 2, and 85% N 2, All
reagents were equilibrated in the anaerobic chamber for at least 24 hours before use.
After 24 hours of growth, samples were removed, spun down to remove cells, and
analyzed for residual dye concentration by measuring absorbance at appropriate
wavelengths. Wavelengths used: 450 nm (FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 6, D&C
Orange No. 4), 360 nm (Balsalazide, Sulfasalazine, Olsalazine, Phenazopyridine), 420
nm (D&C Brown No. 1), 500 nm (D&C Red No. 6, FD&C Red No. 4), 535 nm (D&C Red.

Residual dye concentration was determined by creating a standard curve of
dye concentrations in LB and measuring absorbance at appropriate wavelengths.
Concentration was calculated using the equation of the fitted standard curve line.
Clean deletion creation from Keio collection strains. Competent cells were
created from cultures of the Keio collection knockouts for azoR andfnrknockouts. Cells
were electroporated with vector pSIJ8 (82) and transformants were selected for on LB
supplemented with 25 μg/ml ampicillin at 30°C. Removal of the kanamycin cassette at
FRT sites was done on liquid culture of transformant using 50 mM L-rhamnose for 4
hours, then patch streaked to identify loss of kanamycin resistance. Transformants were
streak-purified two times, then PCR was performed for confirmation of kanamycin
cassette removal. Strains were cured of plasmid at 37°C and then patch-streaked to
confirm loss of ampicillin resistance.
Purified enzyme preparation. The ASKA collection (38) strain expressing azoR
was streaked from glycerol stock on LB with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A single colony
was used to inoculate an overnight culture of 25 ml of LB with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol
aerobically at 37°C. The overnight was used to inoculate 1 L of LB with 30 μg/ml
chloramphenicol at a 1:10 dilution factor. Sample was grown with shaking aerobically to
an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm. Expression of azoR was induced with Isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 1 mM concentration for 3 hours. Cells were then
cooled on ice water for 10 mins and centrifuged at 3,500 x g for 15 mins, washed with
ice cold PBS, spun again, then cell pellets were frozen overnight at -20°C. Pellets were
thawed for on ice, then resuspended in Buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM
imidazole, pH 7.5) and sonicated with the following program: 5 mins, 4 sec on, 4 sec off,
at 30% amplitude. Protease tablets (Sigma Aldrich) were crushed in buffer A and
added to the sonicated lysate. Lysate was centrifuged for 20 mins at 16,000 RPM.
Supernatant was applied to a 5 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) that had been equilibrated with buffer A at a rate of 1 ml/min. The column was
washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A, then 5 column volumes of buffer B (50 mM
HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Protein was eluted with Buffer C (50
mM Hepes, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole) and collected in 5 ml portions. Fractions
were analyzed for protein content using a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel.

Fractions containing proteins corresponding to AzoR
molecular weight were pooled and dialyzed with 3 L of buffer D (50 mM Hepes, 300 mM
NaCl, 15% glycerol by weight, in cold water, pH 7.5) overnight at 4°C. Protein
concentration was determined using Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific).
Purified Enzyme Experiments. AzoR reactions with azo dyes were carried out
in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 100 μM azo dye (unless otherwise noted), 2000 μM
NADH, and 20 μM FMN with varying concentrations of enzyme as appropriate.
Reactions were activated by the addition of NADH. Dye concentration was monitored at
absorbance 450 nm every 30 seconds after a linear shake of 15 seconds. All reactions
were performed aerobically at 37°C.
Keio collection screening for alternative azo reducers. Homologs to genes
implicated in azoreduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (39) were identified by first
gene name and second gene function (tested or predicted) in E. coli. Other stains of
interest were identified based on gene name and function. All strains were cross
referenced on Ecocyc (41). Strains were revived from glycerol stocks on LB agar with
25 μg/ml kanamycin. Single isolates were picked from agar plates and grown overnight
in 1 ml of LB supplemented with 0.05% L-Cysteine in a 96-deep well plate under
anaerobic conditions (see above). For azoreduction assay, previously anaerobically
equilibrated liquid media was supplemented with 25 μM FD&C Red No. 40 and 0.05%
L-Cysteine. 1 ml of media was aliquoted to 2 ml deep 96 well plates and strains were
inoculated at 1:100 from overnight cultures in triplicate. Plates were sealed with
TempPlate Sealing Foil (USA Scientific, Cat #2923-0110) and allowed to grow for 24
hours. After 24 hours, cells were spun down and 100 μl of supernatant was used to
measure dye absorbance at 450 nm. Proportion dye remaining was calculated by
dividing the absorbance of each well by the average absorbance of uninoculated control
wells. Where standard curves were used, a 1:2 dilution series of FD&C Red No. 40 was
made in LB with 0.05% L-Cysteine in triplicate and dye absorbance measured at 450
nm. Concentrations were calculated using the equation of the standard curve line in
Excel.
Validation of Keio collection knockouts. To ensure the knockouts used from
the Keio collection were indeed the annotated gene, primers were designed up and.

PCR and Sanger sequencing of the kanamycin
insert and surrounding regions were performed to ensure the expected band size and
gene alignment. Primers are listed in Table S8.
Overexpression strain construction and assay. Overexpression strains were
made by preparing competent cells for the background strain of interest. Plasmids were
prepared by growing up overnight cultures from the ASKA strain of interest, then using
Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen; Cat #12125) kit to extract the pCA24N plasmid with
the gene of interest. The plasmid preparation was desalted using a membrane filter on
water, then electroperated to the background strain of interest. Correct insertion was
ensured by growth of the transformant on chloramphenicol. A miniprep was also made
from the transformant and then PCR and Sanger sequencing done to ensure the
expected gene insertion.
RNA-Sequencing and proteomics sample growth and exposure. 100 ml of
overnight cultures of both wtand Δfnr E. coli were grown in LB supplemented with
0.05% L-Cysteine under anaerobic conditions. Overnight culture OD 600 nm was measured
for both cultures and normalized to a starting OD 600 nm of 0.05 in 100ml of LB with 0.05%
L-Cysteine in 12 replicates for each strain. OD 600 nm was monitored until mid-exponential
phase for each strain (previously determined). At mid-exponential 3 replicates for each
strain were treated with a final concentration of 250 μM FD&C Red No. 40 in DMSO, or
1% DMSO. After 45 mins of exposure, 15 ml of the sample was removed for RNA
extraction, while the remaining volume was used for proteomics. Both volumes samples
were spun down to pellet cells, supernatant removed, and cell pellets were flash frozen
in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80°C. The remaining samples were allowed to reach
stationary phase, then they were treated with a final concentration of 250 μM FD&C Red
No. 40 in DMSO, or 1% DMSO. Samples were processed the same way as for
mid-exponential.
RNA-sequencing sample preparation. 1 μl of TRI Reagent (Sigma Aldrich
catalog number T9424) was added to bacterial pellets and incubated for 10 mins,
samples were then transferred to 2 ml Lysing Matrix E tubes (MP Biomecials, catalog
number 116914050). Cells were lysed for 5 mins in the bead beater at room
temperature. Next, 200 ul of chloroform was added. Samples were vortexed for 15 sec.

Samples were then centrifuged at
16,000 x g for 15 mins at 4°C. 500 μl of the upper aqueous phase was transferred to a
new tube, 500 μl of 100% ethanol added, and vortexed to mix. Mixture was transferred
to a spin column (PureLink RNA Mini Kit; Life Technologies; catalog number 12183025)
and centrifuged at ≥12,000 x g for 30 sec, discarding flow-through, until all of the
material had been added to the column. To the spin column, 350 µl Wash Buffer I
(PureLink RNA Mini Kit; Life Technologies; catalog number 12183025) was added, then
the column was centrifuged at ≥12,000xg for 30 sec, discarding flow-through. 80 μl of
PureLink DNase mix was added to the column and incubated at room temperature for
15 mins. Next, 350 μl of Wash Buffer I (Purelink RNA mini kit) was added and the
column spun at >12000 x g for 30 sec. The column was transferred to a new collection
tube, and 500 µl Wash Buffer II was added, followed by centrifugation at ≥12,000 x g for
30 sec, discarding flow-through. The column was centrifuged at ≥12,000 x g for 60 sec
and dried, then moved to a collection tube. Then, 50 µl RNase-free water was added,
and the column was incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Finally, the column was
centrifuged for 1 min at ≥12,000xg, retaining the flow-through, which contained total
RNA.
Next, samples were DNase treated again using TURBO-DNase (Ambion;
ThermoFisher catalog number AM2238) and incubated at 37°C for 30 mins. Next, RNA
Ampure XP Beads were used to clean up the reactions. 1.8 volumes of the RNA
Ampure XP beads were added to 1 volume of RNA sample and allowed to sit for 5 mins
at room temperature. Tubes were placed on a magnetic stand until the liquid cleared.
Then liquid was removed and beads washed with 200 μl of 100% Ethanol. Samples
were incubated for 30 sec, then removed. This was repeated twice more. Then,
samples were allowed to dry for 5 mins, removed from the magnetic stand, and 30 μl of
RNase-free water was added. This was incubated for 2 min at room temperature then
placed back on the magnetic rack where liquid was collected after turning clear .
rRNA was removed from total RNA using Ribominus Transcriptome Isolation Kit
for Bacteria and Yeast (Invitrogen; catalog number K155004, LOT: 2116711), following
manufacturer’s protocol. RNA fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, and library preparation
were performed using the NEBNext Ultra RNA library Prep Kit for Illumina and NEBNext.

Samples were
dual-end sequenced (2 x 75 bp) using the NextSeq Mid Output platform (Table S2).
Reads were mapped to the E. coli K12 BW25113 genome sequence (NCBI Reference
Sequence: GCA_000750555.1) using Bowtie2 (83) and HTSeq (84) was used to count
the number of reads to E. coli genes. Differential gene expression was analyzed using
limma (85). Differentially expressed genes were defined as transcripts exhibiting an
absolute log 2fold-change ≥1 and a FDR<0.1.
Proteomics sample preparation. Cell pellets were washed three times with 5
ml of cold PBS and resuspended in 1 ml, transferred to 2 ml Lysing Matrix E tubes (MP
Biomecials, catalog number 116914050) and lysed via bead beating for 1 min, then
resting tubes on ice for 2 mins. This was repeated twice. Samples were centrifuged for
15 min at 4°C at 16,000 x g. Next, a BCA assay was performed to quantify protein
concentration in the lysate supernatant. Next, urea was added to the samples to a
target concentration of 8 M followed by an appropriate volume of Dithiothreitol to obtain
a 5 mM concentration. Samples were then incubated at 60°C for 30 mins. While
samples were incubating, the trypsin was pre-activated for 10 mins at 37°C. Next,
samples were diluted 10-fold with 100 mM NH 4HCO 3. Next, 1 M CaCl 2was added at an
appropriate volume to create a final sample concentration of 1 mM CaCl≤. Samples
were then digested for 3 hours with Trypsin at 37°C at a concentration of 1 μg trypsin/
50 μg protein. Samples were snap frozen.
Next, samples were cleaned with a C 18column on a vacuum manifold. The
column was conditioned with 3 ml of Methanol, then rinsed with 2 ml of 0.1% TFA
acidified water. Sample was run though column, then column was rinsed with 4 ml of
95:5 H 2O:acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Column was allowed to go
to dryness, then eluted slowly to dryness with 1 ml of 80:20 ACN:H 2O, 0.1% TFA into a
collection tube. Samples were concentrated in the speed-vac to a volume of
approxoimatly 50-100 μl. Protein quantification was done using a BCA test, then
samples were stored at -80°C until analysis.
Proteomics. A Waters nano-Acquity M-Class dual pumping UPLC system
(Milford, MA) was configured for on-line trapping of a 5 µL injection at 5 µL/min with
reverse-flow elution into the analytical column at 300 nL/min. The trapping column was.

were 325 °C and 2.2 kV, respectively. Data were collected for 100 min following a 20 min
delay from sample injection. FT-MS spectra were acquired from 400 to 2000  m/zat a
resolution of 35k (AGC target 3e6) and while the top 12 FT-HCD-MS/MS spectra were
acquired in data dependent mode with an isolation window of 2.0 m/z and at a
resolution of 17.5k (AGC target 1e5) using a normalized collision energy of 30 sec and
a 30 sec exclusion time. Extracted MS data were run through the MSGF+ database and
filtered by an FDR of >0.01 using the MSGF+ generated decoy database. Differential
peptide expression was analyzed using DEP (87) and limma (85). Differentially
expressed genes were defined as transcripts exhibiting an absolute log 2fold-change ≥1
and a FDR<0.1.
Hydrogen sulfide quantification. H2S was measured using the Cline reaction
(88) with modifications. Specifically, samples were put into a zinc acetate buffer (16.7
mM) on ice at a ratio of 1:3 sample:buffer. Then 180 μl of zinc acetate solution was
transferred and mixed with 20 μl of cline reagent (2 g of
N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate with 3 g of FeCl 3in 500 ml of cold 50% v/v
HCl). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20-30 minutes at room temperature in the
dark. Then absorbances were measured at 670 nm. A standard curve of sodium sulfide
was created in zinc acetate and reacted with cline reagents for sulfide concentration
calculations.. CC-BY 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

P1 lysates were generated of each strain of
interest carrying the kanamycin resistance cassette (Keio collection) adapting methods
from previously described techniques (89). Briefly, 150 μl of overnight culture in LB
supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml kanamycin was mixed with 1 to 25 μl of P1 phage
(previously propagated from ATCC on MG1655). This mixture was incubated for 10 min
at 37°C to aid absorption, added to 3 ml of 0.7% agar, and overlaid on pre-warmed LB
agar supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 10 mM MgSO4. Plates were
incubated overnight at 37°C and phage were harvested by adding 5 ml of SM buffer,
incubating at room temperature for 10 mins, and breaking the top agar for phage
harvest. The mixture was briefly centrifuged to pellet agar, then supernatant was passed
through a 100 μm cell straining, then 0.45 μm syringe filter. Lysates were stored at 4°C.
A clean deletion of the recipient strain of interest was created using the above
described method with pSIJ8 (82). To transduce the clean recipient strain, 1 ml of an
overnight culture of recipient strain was pelleted and resuspended in ⅓ volume of LB 10
mM MgSO4, 5 mM CaCl 2. 100 μl of cells were mixed with 1 μl to 10 μl of P1 lysate and
incubated for 60 min at 37°C. Next, 200 μl of 1M sodium citrate was added with 1 ml of
LB to minimize secondary infection. This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 hrs, then
plated on LB supplemented with 10 mM sodium citrate and 25 μg/ml kanamycin to
select for transductants. Transduction was confirmed using PCR and Sanger
sequencing. Azoreduction and sulfide activity were tested as described above.
Statistical analysis. For multiple comparisons of data, an ordinary one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with Dunnet’s correction was chosen, unless
otherwise specified. For the targeted knockout screen, a 95% confidence interval of
averages from two experiments was calculated using GraphPad Prism 9.
Michaelis-menten curves were created in Prism 9. For proteomics and transcriptomics
analysis, R package limma was used to determine the fold-change and adjusted
p-values. Feature count differences (Figure S4) and Wilcoxon rank-sum significance
testing were done in R. For the regulator enrichment analysis, Ecocyc’s enrichment
analysis for “Genes enriched for transcriptional/translational regulators (direct only)” was
used with a fisher-exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg Correction..

reduction. Under anaerobic conditions, FNR activates the transcription of cyuR. CyuR
in turn activates expression of the cyuAP operon. CyuP transports L-Cysteine into the
cell, where it is metabolized to H 2S through the CyuA desulfidase. Released H 2S can
reduce the azo bond of azo compounds. Created with BioRender.com.

(A) Purified AzoR protein from
E. coli AG1 has the expected size (23 kDa) on an SDS-PAGE gel. (B) AzoR protein has
variable impacts on the depletion of a panel of FD&C dyes. Incubations were conducted
in PBS buffer with 2000μM NADH, and 20μM FMN at 37°C for 15 min, then proportion
of the dye depleted was measured by spectrophotometric and calculated relative to no
enzyme controls (n=3 biological replicates/strain).
