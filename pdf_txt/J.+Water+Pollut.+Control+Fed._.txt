The Story Behind How the 1972 Act 
Became the Capstone  
on a Decade of Extraordinary 
Environmental Reform
by N . William Hines*
Most environmental law scholars would probably 
agree that three ambitious pieces of federal legis -
lation, adopted within a three-year period forty 
years ago, form the backbone of the nation’s continuing 
eﬀorts to control and prevent environmental pollution . Of 
the three iconic statutes—the National Environmental Pol -
icy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”),1 the Clean Air Act of 1970,2 and 
the 1972 Clean Water Act (“CWA”)3—many environmental 
law scholars would likely agree that the CWA was the best 
designed and most artfully drafted . At least some would also 
agree that over the forty years of its existence, the CWA has 
been the most e ﬀective in achieving its objectives .4 Admirers 
of the impressive national progress under the CAA might 
disagree, however .
For the entire millennium prior to adoption of the 1972 
CWA, the capacity of a waterway to absorb and dilute delete -
rious wastes legally was considered a common resource sub -
ject to exploitation by anyone having access to the water . /T_he 
Anglo-American common law of nuisance allowed any dis -
charger to dump wastes into a waterway up to the point the 
resulting pollution caused unreasonable harm to another per -
son’s property right or to the public interest .5 Starting in the 
19th century, many states codi /f_ied these nuisance law prin -

constitute private and public nuisances as a matter of law . 
State courts, however, generally recognized that the organic 
common law of nuisance would continue to evolve .6 In one 
bold stroke, the 1972 CWA abrogated this traditional legal 
doctrine that de /f_ined actionable water pollution in terms of 
unreasonable harm . /T_he new law accomplished this critical 
reversal by adopting as a long-term goal the elimination of all 
polluting discharges to the nation’s waters, and by creating a 
complex new regulatory regime employing technology-based 
eﬄuent limitations to accomplish this ambitious goal .
Unlike Athena, the 1972 CWA did not spring full-grown 
from the brow of Zeus . T o the contrary , it was the culmi -
nation of over eighty years of gradually intensifying federal 
involvement in the increasingly serious deterioration in the 
quality of the nation’s waters .7 Between the /f_irst, very limited 
intervention into a local water pollution problem in 18868 
and the adoption of the formal Federal Water Pollution Con -
trol Act in 1948,9 bills dealing with water pollution went 
before Congress in all but six sessions .10 Despite periodic 
changes in the federal program (six signi /f_icant amendments), 
twenty-four years passed between the very modest initiatives 
in the 1948 Act and the bold strides made in the 1972 CWA .

framework and ratchet up the federal /f_inancial support for 
state and local pollution control e ﬀorts.11
After a brief look at the status of state water pollution con -
trol programs immediately before the adoption of the 1972 
CWA, this paper will follow the development of the fed -
eral program for combating water pollution across its entire 
pre-1972 history, grouping developments into three discrete 
historical segments: (1)  between the /f_irst primitive control 
statute in 1886 and the /f_irst fumbling attempt at a compre -
hensive statute in 1948; (2)  between 1948 and the beginning 
of a serious, federally-organized regulatory program in the 
Water Quality Act of 1965 (“WQA”); and (3)  between the 
1965 WQA and the adoption of the 1972 CWA, the pas -
sage of which required a congressional override of President 
Nixon’s veto . Finally, the paper will identify the key elements 
in the 1972 CWA and try to trace their origins in the legisla -
tive and administrative history of the Act .
In recounting this history, the paper will place primary 
emphasis on the third period indicated above, which is by far 
the most dynamic and interesting . At the outset, it is worthy 
of note that there was an unprecedented escalation in the 
national interest in combating environmental pollution dur -
ing the decade before the 1972 CWA was enacted . Much 
of this heightened public interest was sparked by the pub -
lication of best-selling books12 and high-pro /f_ile government 
reports13 that sounded clear alarms about the rapidly rising 
costs of manmade destruction of the natural environment . 
National media coverage of burning rivers, massive /f_ish kills, 
declining shell /f_ish populations, and closed beaches also cap -
tured public attention .14 Not coincidentally, a number of 
active citizen-led organizations emerged during this period, 
dedicated to /f_ighting pollution on several fronts and seek -
ing major reforms in the nation’s regulatory regime a ﬀect-
ing environmental resources . Also, some important judicial 
rulings were decided that emboldened environmentalists to 
become more aggressive, which in turn led to extraordinary 
legislative initiatives in Congress, all of which a ﬀected Amer -
ican citizens’ relationship with the natural environment in 
important ways that have never been replicated in the four 
decades since this period .

(describing the smoldering Cuyahoga River) .I. The Status of State Water Pollution 
Control Programs Entering the 1970s
A. State  Programs  Limited  in Scope
Before tracing the background of the 1972 CWA at the fed -
eral level, we should note at the outset that, before the mid-
1960s, the task of controlling water pollution was almost 
universally believed to be a state responsibility .15 Much of 
the early resistance to fashioning any federal role in control -
ling water pollution was grounded in the belief that deal -
ing with such pollution was strictly a state or local matter . 
/T_herefore, the a ﬀected states or localities should step up and 
mount whatever regulatory e ﬀort was required to eliminate 
the pollution .16 President Eisenhower even vetoed one of the 
early congressional attempts to expand the federal role in 
combatting water pollution and gave as his primary justi /f_ica-
tion that the proposed statute violated the concept of federal -
ism by intruding too far into an exclusively state regulatory 
domain .17
In the 19th century, local governments gradually began 
exerting legal authority over serious water pollution problems 
within their jurisdiction . As concern grew over the pollution 
of entire rivers or watersheds, more and more states created 
state agencies charged with regulating water quality within 
the state’s waterways . By the time the federal government 
began to take an interest in controlling water pollution, every 
state had an agency or department speci /f_ically responsible 
for monitoring water quality and working to eliminate pol -
lution .18 Typically, this agency was part of the state’s public 
health department, and it was primarily sta ﬀed with profes -
sionals specializing in sanitary engineering .19 /T_his sta ﬃng 
re/f_lected the perception of the time that the only water pol -
lution problems worthy of being addressed were those that 
/f_lowed directly from sanitary sewers, from municipal waste 
treatment plants providing only primary treatment, and 
from industries dumping large loads of raw organic waste 
material into waterways .20
During this period, it is fair to say that most state laws 
were quite weak when it came time to undertake e ﬀective 
legal enforcement against known polluters .21 Even when state 
statutes appeared su ﬃcient to support aggressive enforce -

ment against polluters, tough enforcement was simply not 
the norm .22 Generally, those charged with enforcing the 
law much preferred a strategy of o ﬀering inducements and 
friendly persuasion to one of confronting polluters with legal 
action .23 /T_his, however, is not to place sole blame on state 
authorities for the dramatic worsening of the nation’s water 
quality during the /f_irst half of the 20th century; rather, it is 
only to note the widespread reluctance of state o ﬃcials to 
employ the limited enforcement options that did exist .24 /T_his 
non-enforcement norm represented the preference for seek -
ing voluntary compliance by polluters, which was prevalent 
among the sanitary engineers who ran the state programs at 
the time . /T_he approach of sanitary engineers is perhaps best 
summed up in their favorite axiom: “Dilution is the solution 
to pollution .”25
On the other hand, by the time the 1972 CWA was 
adopted, the world of water pollution control had changed . 
Just a few years had passed since federal law /f_irst required 
all the states to adopt new water quality standards for their 
interstate waters . By 1970, implementation of the 1965 
WQA was proceeding at a good pace in the states, and the 
legal and administrative di ﬃculties in developing e ﬀective 
enforcement strategies for translating the emerging water 
quality standards into cleaner water were just beginning 
to be recognized and tackled .26 /T_he prevailing perception 
in Congress, however, as expressed repeatedly during the 
debates over the 1972 CWA,27 was that it was hopeless to 
expect the states to develop su ﬃciently tough regulatory 
controls on water pollution to make real progress on clean -
ing up the nation’s rivers and lakes . A major report at the 
time, however, concluded that this assessment was prema -
ture and probably unjusti /f_ied.28 Congress obviously did not 
agree .
B. The  1971 National  Water  Commission  Report
In 1971, I headed a team of researchers commissioned by the 
National Water Commission to conduct a nation-wide study 
of state-level water pollution control programs .29 We surveyed 
all /f_ifty state programs, asking a battery of questions about 
how they were dealing with the most pressing water pollu -
tion issues within their jurisdiction .30 In addition, we identi -
/f_ied what we deemed the nine best state programs and spent 
considerable time on the ground with them, studying their 
regulatory activities in much greater detail . Our 1971 report

30. States thoroughly studied were Alabama, California, Iowa, Michigan, New 
York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas . Id. at 284 .con/f_irmed that all /f_ifty states had prepared and submitted 
water quality standards for their interstate waters as man -
dated by the 1965 WQA, and they were busily engaged in 
implementing them .31 Forty-seven of the states already had 
in place permit systems to control the biggest point-source 
polluters .32 Among the nine state programs most carefully 
studied, a median of ninety-eighty percent of their publically 
owned treatment works (“POTW”)33 were already operating 
under state permits that required them to apply secondary 
treatment,34 and a median of eighty-eight percent of indus -
trial polluters were also operating under permits .35 Although 
these compliance numbers were self-reported, and therefore 
possibly exaggerated, and the permits for industrial discharg -
ers were certainly not technology-based, my research at the 
time nevertheless suggested that a dramatic expansion of the 
federal role in controlling water pollution was unnecessary 
and unjusti /f_ied. Congress did not heed my contention, and 
with the bene /f_it of forty years of hindsight, Congress was 
right.
Congress, however, made a particularly wise decision 
in the 1972 CWA to retain the traditional deference to 
state water pollution control agencies to implement the 
new e ﬄuent limitations . /T_he decision to delegate to the 
states responsibility for the day-to-day administration of 
the new National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System 
(“NPDES”) was not based on abstract principles of federal -
ism like those cited above by President Eisenhower, or on 
key congressional leaders wanting to treat the states’ inter -
ests with special respect . Instead, it was based on the prac -
tical recognition that the human resources employed by 
the U .S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) at this 
point in time were small compared with the large number 
of technical experts and management personnel imbedded 
in state programs across the country—programs that then 
accounted for over ninety- /f_ive percent of the ongoing regu -
latory activity in U .S. water pollution control .36 /T_his model 
of cooperative federalism has been retained throughout the 
forty-year history of the CWA .

a term of art in section  301(b) of the 1972 CWA . CWA §  301(b), 33 U .S.C. 
§ 1251(b) (2006) . Oddly, the Act does not de /f_ine this important term, but it

II. Federal Efforts from 1886 to 1948
A. The  Rivers  and Harbors  Act
/T_he /f_irst federal intervention into controlling water pollu -
tion was a very modest one . In 1886, Congress enacted an 
early version of what was to become the Rivers and Har -
bors Act of 1899, also later known as the Refuse Act .37 /T_his 
early statute charged the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) 
with preventing the dumping of materials into the harbors 
of New York City that might pose an impediment to navi -
gation .38 /T_he regulatory authority granted to the Corps was 
extended in 1890 to grant jurisdiction over other harbors in 
the United States .39 In 1899, the Refuse Act was amended to 
broaden the Corps’ regulatory authority to reach all of the 
nation’s navigable waters and their tributaries without regard 
to whether the discharges actually impeded navigation .40 Of 
vital importance to the modern history of U .S. water pollu -
tion control, the 1899 amendments to the Rivers and Har -
bors Act also gave the Corps the authority to regulate all 
discharges of wastes to the a ﬀected waters,41 except liquid 
wastes /f_lowing from municipal sanitary sewers and storm 
sewers . Interestingly, this potentially powerful federal tool 
to control and prevent water pollution nationwide remained 
dormant for over seventy years until revitalized by a Supreme 
Court decision in 1966 .42 We will return to this development 
later to describe its major impact on the shape of the 1972 
CWA .
B. U.S.  Public  Health  Service  Takes the Lead
Early in the 20th century, new scienti /f_ic knowledge about the 
sources of water-borne communicable diseases like typhoid 
and cholera spurred national interest in the public health 
aspects of water pollution .43 In 1912, the U .S. Public Health 
Service (“PHS”) received congressional authorization to 
investigate the connection between pollution in the nation’s 
navigable rivers and lakes and adverse health e ﬀects su ﬀered 
by persons using the waters for household purposes .44 /T_he 
PHS was not granted any power to initiate corrective mea -
sures to abate the pollution it found, but this proved to be

this health hazard through improved treatment of drinking 
water . Close cooperation between PHS and state and local 
public health departments led to the adoption of national 
standards for chlorination and other treatments of public 
drinking water supplies, which all but eliminated water-car -
ried diseases in the United States .45
C. Oil  Pollution  Act of 1924
/T_he next water pollution problem to attract national atten -
tion was oil pollution resulting from discharges from ships 
plying coastal waters . Not only did this pollution render 
public beaches un /f_it for bathing and create a /f_ire hazard 
around harbors and docks, but it also caused great harm to 
certain key shell /f_ish production areas .46 /T_he Oil Pollution 
Act of 1924 outlawed the dumping of oil into coastal waters 
and charged the Secretary of War with enforcement of the 
law.47 Expanded to also cover other hazardous substances, 
an updated version of this law became part of the 1972 
CWA .48
D. Roosevelt  Vetoes  Proposed  New Federal  Program
/T_he success of the Oil Pollution Act in dealing with a seri -
ous water pollution problem inspired members of Congress 
to consider broader federal action to deal with the growing 
concerns about water quality expressed by /f_ish and wildlife 
specialists and conservation groups .49 Senator Augustine 
Lonergan of Connecticut convened a national conference in 
1934, at which water quality experts were invited to assess the 
nation’s water quality problems and to suggest what might be 
the proper federal role in ameliorating them .50 /T_he theme of 
the conference was to “destroy pollution before it destroys 
us.”51 In the same year, the National Resources Committee 
appointed a Special Advisory Committee on Water Pollu -
tion.52 Both the conference report and the Advisory Com -
mittee concluded that there was a serious water pollution 
problem in America .53 In 1935, the recommendations from

these two sources stimulated the introduction of the /f_irst 
legislative proposal to launch an active federal program in 
water quality management .54 Although this bill did not pass, 
it is interesting to note that the federal program envisioned 
in this legislation would have interjected the federal gov -
ernment into the water pollution control business in rather 
extensive ways, and yet no one raised much resistance at the 
time on states’ rights grounds .
/T_he next year, 1936, marked the /f_irst of a series of near 
misses in attempts to create a federal water pollution control 
program .55 Proponents of the reform legislation succeeded 
in getting a modest federal program passed in both houses 
of Congress, only to see the initiative fail on a motion to 
reconsider in the waning days of the session .56 /T_he key 
reason the proposal failed was objection to the inclusion 
of federal enforcement powers in the bill .57 Eﬀorts were 
continued in 1937, and in 1938, proponents of a federal 
program for water pollution control again steered their bill 
successfully through both houses of Congress, only to have 
it vetoed by President Roosevelt on an obtuse “separation 
of powers” ground, namely that one appropriations provi -
sion invaded the prerogatives of the Executive Branch .58 
President Roosevelt, however, recognized the general pop -
ularity of the water pollution control initiative and, in a 
special message to Congress in 1939, stated that he “fully 
subscrib[ed] to the general purposes” of the act he vetoed 
in 1938 .59
E. World  War II Sidetracks  Reforms
President Roosevelt’s public support spurred the proponents 
of a federal program to try again, and a number of anti-pol -
lution bills were introduced in 1939 .60 /T_hese bills carried over 
until 1940, when both houses of Congress again passed the 
proposals .61 /T_he two bills that were passed, however, were 
quite di ﬀerent in approach, and the conference committee 
could not reach agreement on a compromise bill before the

gram to deal with water pollution on a national scale came 
close to adoption, but in the end, fell short . /T_he industrial 
mobilization for World War II between 1940 and 1945 
greatly increased the magnitude of the nation’s water pol -
lution problems, but the war e ﬀort so distracted members 
of Congress that Congress put new water pollution control 
legislation on the back burner until the war ended .63 Con -
gress introduced bills to create a federal water pollution con -
trol agency in 1941, 1943, and 1944, but none of them were 
reported out of committee .64
F. Post-War  Action  on Reforms
As early as November 1945, Congress initiated hearings on 
four bills proposing new federal antipollution laws .65 Co n -
gress seemingly lost these bills in the great mass of postwar 
legislation during the period, however, and water pollution 
control did not emerge again as a topic for serious discussion 
until 1947, when Congress considered four nearly identical 
bills, each of which proposed the creation of a new federal 
water pollution control program .66 Congressman Brent 
Spence and Senators Alben Barkely, Robert Taft, and Freder -
ick Vinson were all very active in promoting this legislation .67 
Not surprisingly, all of the bills under consideration in 1947 
were closely based on the legislation that passed both houses 
in 1938, only to be vetoed by President Roosevelt .68
/T_he Surgeon General led o ﬀ the 1947 hearings in the 
Senate by stating, “[t]he necessity for the Federal Govern -
ment to go into this matter of giving aid for the prevention 
of stream pollution is, I think, very clear if we consider the 
facts.”69 /T_his proposition was never really challenged in the 
hearings, where most of the discussion focused on the scope 
and proper power of the proposed federal program .70 /T_he bill 
that /f_inally passed the Senate in 1947 was substantially over -
hauled in the House,71 and the Senate generally acceded to 
the House changes . /T_he /f_irst Federal Water Pollution Con -

III. The Evolution of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Program from 
Beginning Steps in the 1948 Act to the 
Comprehensive 1965 Water Quality Act
A. Shortcomings  of the 1948 Federal  Water  Pollution  
Control  Act
Judged by the precepts of modern water pollution control, it 
would be charitable to describe the 1948 Act as a promising 
start on a comprehensive federal program, but it was at least 
a start . /T_he federal role, as envisioned by the 1948 Act, was 
a very secondary one in relation to state and local pollution 
control activities . In the opening sentence of the Act, Con -
gress declared federal jurisdiction over “the waterways of the 
Nation,” but it then went on to announce the federal policy 
to be primarily one of supporting state and local agencies 
in their water pollution abatement e ﬀorts through research, 
technical services, and /f_inancial assistance .74 A d m i n i s t r a -
tive responsibility for the operation of the federal program 
was assigned to the PHS under the leadership of the Sur -
geon General .75 /T_he 1948 Act set out a number of areas in 
which there was to be cooperation between state and federal 
programs, but it always gave deference to the state programs 
to decide whether federal assistance was needed and how it 
should be provided .76 /T_he 1948 Act speci /f_ically encouraged 
the promulgation of uniform state laws and the creation of 
interstate compacts to regulate water pollution .77 /T_he Act 
also authorized funds to make modest grants to state agen -
cies for surveys and studies of existing and potential pollu -
tion problems, and to make loans to help subsidize the cost 
of needed waste treatment facilities .78 A major di ﬃculty on 
this front was that Congress did not appropriate any funds 
for the /f_irst year of the new federal agency, and in subsequent 
years, Congress only appropriated about ten percent of the 
funds authorized .79
Perhaps most indicative of the weakness of the initial fed -
eral program was the virtual absence of enforcement powers . 
/T_he 1948 Act boldly declared it to be a public nuisance sub -
ject to abatement whenever any interstate condition of water 
pollution endangered the health or welfare of persons in a 
state other than the state where the pollution originated,80 
but abatement of the nuisance was not easy . Wh e n  a  p o l -
lution claim was made, the Act authorized the Surgeon 
General to conduct an investigation to determine whether 
actionable pollution was, in fact, occurring .81 If the Surgeon 
General’s investigation found that pollution existed, the

81. Id. § 2(a), 62 Stat . 1155 .1948 Act required the agency to give the polluter notice of 
what actions were required to abate the nuisance, and grant 
reasonable time for the polluter to comply with the abate -
ment plan .82 If no corrective action from the polluter was 
forthcoming, the 1948 Act authorized the Surgeon General 
to request the Federal Security Administrator to conduct a 
public hearing to determine whether it was reasonable and 
equitable to secure abatement of the pollution .83 If, as a result 
of the public hearing, abatement was deemed appropriate, 
the Surgeon General could request the U .S. Attorney Gen -
eral to bring a suit against the polluter to secure abatement 
of the public nuisance—but again, only after the state pol -
lution control agency had given its consent to the suit .84 It is 
diﬃcult to imagine an enforcement procedure more poorly 
designed to secure prompt and meaningful action on the 
part of an industrial or municipal polluter, the assumed vil -
lains during this era .
B. The  1956 Amendments
Due to severe underfunding and serious understa ﬃng of 
professional personnel, the implementation of the 1948 Act 
got o ﬀ to a very slow start . In its /f_irst three years of operation, 
the PHS accumulated very little actual experience in dealing 
with the nation’s water pollution issues, but it learned enough 
to know that the problems were much more egregious than 
assumed when the 1948 Act was passed .85 Progress in getting 
any serious regulatory activity o ﬀ the ground was so slug -
gish that in 1952, the year before the federal water pollu -
tion program was up for reauthorization, Congress quietly 
extended the temporary status of the agency for three more 
years, until 1956 .86 Faced with the looming reauthorization 
for the federal program, in 1955, Congress began the process 
of constructing a permanent legislative base for the national 
water pollution control program .
Hearings in the Senate focused on two controversial 
proposals to strengthen the federal program created by the 
1948 Act .87 /T_he /f_irst proposal was to grant the Surgeon 
General the power to establish water quality standards for

consent requirements . See Seymour C . Wagner, Statutory Stream Pollution 
Control , 100 U. P/a.sc. L. R/e.sc/v.sc. 225, 238 (1951) (discussing how the consent 
requirements rendered the enforcement powers nearly illusory) . /T_he issue of 
consent was one of the most controversial to arise during debate on this act . 
/T_he principal point of dispute was whether to give the federal enforcement 
agency authority to compel abatement of the pollution without the consent 
of the state where the pollution arises . F/e.sc/d.sc. S/e.sc/c.sc. A/g.sc/e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/y.sc , E/x.sc/c.sc/e.sc/r.sc/p.sc/t.sc/s.sc  /f.sc/r.sc/o.sc/m.sc

interstate waters .88 Congressional leaders ultimately deemed 
this proposal too radical and deleted it from the reauthoriza -
tion bill passed by the Senate .89 /T_he second proposal was to 
strengthen the federal enforcement powers . Arguments made 
against this proposal included that it violated the cooperative 
philosophy of the 1948 Act, it intruded into the domain of 
predominantly state and local powers, and it lacked justi /f_ica-
tion, given that the existing enforcement powers had never 
been exercised .90 Notwithstanding these objections, the 
upgrade in federal enforcement authority survived the Senate 
vote on the bill and it was sent on to the House of Represen -
tatives .91 /T_he House held hearings on the Senate bill, but it 
did not take action on it until 1956, when a new House bill, 
authored by Congressman John A . Blatnik, was substituted 
for the Senate bill . /T_he House bill was very similar to the Sen -
ate bill, but with two major changes: the House bill watered 
down federal enforcement authority and inserted a new one 
billion dollar federal construction grant program to assist 
with municipal waste treatment facilities .92 /T_he House bill 
also made no provision for the creation of federal water qual -
ity standards . After a good deal of back and forth between 
the House and Senate, Congress passed the Water Pollution 
Control Act Amendments and President Eisenhower signed 
the bill into law without any further mention of water quality 
standards .93
As a technical matter, the 1956 amendments were simply 
aﬃxed to the bare skeleton of the 1948 Act, but they provided 
for a somewhat better organized and more aggressive fed -
eral pollution control program than the earlier law . Federal 
fealty to the hegemony of state and local control e ﬀorts was 
reaﬃrmed rhetorically, but it was also clear from the sizeable 
increases in the variety and magnitude of federal support and 
the very modest sti ﬀening of federal enforcement powers that 
the federal government’s role in water pollution control was 
signi/f_icantly expanded .94
Speci /f_ically, research and training activities were increased, 
a new grant-in aid program to assist state and interstate con -
trol programs was introduced, and, most importantly, the 
construction loan program of the 1948 Act was replaced with 
a large-scale construction grant program that was to grow in 
size over the years .95 /T_he loans o ﬀered to local governments 
under the 1948 Act proved unpopular with municipalities, so 
they produced little new construction of badly needed public 
waste water treatment facilities . /T_he new federal grant pro -

pace with the demand .96 Over the ensuing /f_ifteen years, the 
size of the construction grant program increased exponen -
tially and ultimately became a major federal spending issue 
between Congress and Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon .97
/T_he 1956 Amendments enhanced the federal enforce -
ment powers in two ways . First, the new law removed the 
requirement that a state must /f_irst request the federal agency 
to investigate an alleged pollution before the federal agency 
could begin any action .98 Second, the amendments inserted a 
new “conference” stage into the enforcement process between 
the investigation con /f_irming an actionable condition of pol -
lution and the public hearing . /T_he idea was to bring together 
at the conference representatives of the local, state, and fed -
eral agencies to formulate a cooperative plan to deal with the 
problem . Congress only authorized the federal agency to seek 
enforcement by the U .S. Attorney General if the state or local 
actions failed to achieve the desired abatement, and Congress 
still conditioned this authority on receiving consent for a fed -
eral suit from either the state causing the pollution or the 
state su ﬀering the pollution .
C. The  1961 Amendments
/T_he ink was barely dry on the 1956 Amendments before 
Congressman Blatnik introduced new legislation in the 
House to double the size of the construction grant program .99 
/T_he Congressman claimed that the success of the construc -
tion grant program had been “nothing short of phenome -
nal,” generating nearly four dollars in local expenditures for 
every one dollar in federal grants .100 /T_his initiative triggered 
a strong reaction from President Eisenhower and the Depart -
ment of Health Education and Welfare (“HEW”), where the 
federal program was based .101 /T_he President and the Secre -
tary of HEW sponsored legislation that called for the com -
plete termination of the federal construction grant program 
on the ground that the construction of waste water treatment 
facilities was a matter of state and local concern and should 
be funded entirely by the a ﬀected communities .102
Led by the strong advocacy of Senator Robert S . Kerr,103 
the Senate sided with the House in this squabble, and the 
bill that ultimately cleared the conference committee called 
for increasing the construction grant program from /f_ifty mil -

lion dollars annually to ninety million dollars annually .104 In 
February 1960, President Eisenhower vetoed this legislation, 
stating in his veto message that because water pollution was a 
“uniquely local blight, primary responsibility for solving the 
problem lies not with the Federal Government, but rather 
must be assumed and exercised, as it has been, by state and 
local governments .”105 /T_he President went on to say that he 
favored those parts of the legislation that provided additional 
funds to help strengthen state and local control programs 
and the proposed further strengthening of federal enforce -
ment powers .106 /T_he President also called for the convening 
of a National Conference on Water Pollution to assess the 
national water pollution problem and consider how best to 
attack it . Congress attempted to override the veto, but that 
attempt failed .107
President Kennedy’s election in November 1960 clearly 
altered the Executive Branch’s resistance to a larger federal 
role in water pollution control . /T_he National Conference 
urged by President Eisenhower was convened in December 
1960 . /T_he conference neither took a position on the sensitive 
issues of federal-state relationships, nor embraced President 
Eisenhower’s view that the continued need for large-scale 
federal support for the construction of municipal waste 
water treatment facilities should be terminated .108 Shortly 
thereafter, the Senate’s Select Committee on National Water 
Resources issued its /f_inal report in which it recommended a 
doubling of the federal investment in the construction grant 
program .109 /T_he new President manifested much less concern 
than did his predecessor about preserving an appropriate bal -
ance between state and federal hegemony in dealing with 
domestic problems clearly national in their scope .110 In Feb -
ruary 1961, President Kennedy, in his /f_irst address to Con -
gress, urged that the water pollution problem had reached 
alarming proportions, and “could no longer be regarded with 
complacency .”111
With several funding authorizations in the 1956 Amend -
ments expiring in June 1961, both the Senate and the House 
accelerated their activities on new water pollution legislation 
early in that year . Congressman Blatnik and Senator Kerr 
introduced bills in their respective chambers, which received 
hearings and were ultimately approved112 /T_he House bill 
passed only after another /f_ight with states’ rights advocates 
over the extent and size of the appropriate federal role .113 
A conference committee reconciled the two bills into the

/T_he most important features of the 1961 Amendments 
were (1)  the transfer of administrative authority for the pro -
gram from the Surgeon General to the Secretary of HEW; 
(2) the expansion of federal jurisdiction from strictly inter -
state waters to “navigable or interstate waters in or adjacent 
to any state or states;” (3)  the substantial increases in fed -
eral dollars to support basic and regional research, and local, 
state, and interstate control programs; (4)  the doubling of the 
authorization for the construction grant program; and (5)  the 
large increase in the size of a grant that can be awarded to a 
single local project and to combined projects .115
D. The  Continuing  Drive to Adopt  Water  Quality  
Standards
Congressional crusaders for a much more aggressive federal 
role in abating, what they considered, the national scourge 
of water pollution were again left dissatis /f_ied with the 1961 
amendments, much as they had been with the 1956 amend -
ments . In 1963, both the Senate and the House began hear -
ings aimed at identifying the major obstacles to improving 
pollution control .116 A House subcommittee chaired by Con -
gressman Robert E . Jones held hearings across the country 
to collect information that could help transform the federal 
eﬀort into a more e ﬀective force for the improvement of 
water quality .
In April 1963, the Senate Committee on Public Works 
created a new Special Subcommittee on Air and Water 
Pollution,117 which was destined to play a pivotal role in 
the battles that were to enliven Congress over its next two 
sessions . /T_he subcommittee’s /f_irst act was to commission 
its sta ﬀ to undertake its own study of the nation’s air and 
water pollution problems .118 On behalf of the new subcom -
mittee, Senator Edmund Muskie introduced S . 649, which 
proposed two major changes . First, the bill called for the 
creation of a Federal Water Pollution Control Administra -
tion (“FWPCA”) within HEW to consolidate and adminis -
ter the ever-expanding federal program .119 Second, and most 
controversially, the bill called for the Secretary of HEW to 
establish national water quality standards, creating both 
receiving water (ambient) standards and discharge (e ﬄuent) 
standards for all interstate and navigable waters .120 /T_he battle 
between advocates and opponents of water quality standards 
was joined in earnest at the Senate committee hearings on

S. 649.121 As amended to provide new provisions dealing 
with synthetic detergents and discharges from federal instal -
lations, the bill easily passed the Senate in October 1963 .122
Meanwhile, in the House, Congressman Blatnik was 
not idle . His  r ef o rm  p r o p o sal ,  H .R. 3166, was the subject 
of hearings before a House committee . /T_he House commit -
tee, however, elected to report out S . 649, but not before it 
reduced the HEW Secretary’s power with respect to water 
quality standards to the mere authority to make recommen -
dations to the states .123 All of this churning over the issue of 
water quality standards consumed time and no compromise 
legislation emerged before the end of the 88th Congress .
Senator Muskie acted quickly in 1965 at the beginning 
of the 89th Congress to reintroduce his reform legislation at 
S. 4, and the Muskie bill was quickly maneuvered through 
the Senate .124 On the House side, Congressman Blatnik rein -
troduced his proposal as H .R. 3988, and both bills shared 
the spotlight at hearings before the House Committee on 
Public Works .125 Not surprisingly, most of the debate in these 
hearings centered on the water quality standards called for in 
S. 4.126 In March 1965, the House committee chose to report 
out the Senate bill,127 but again, only after downgrading the 
water quality standards component into the mere federal 
encouragement of state initiatives, which, if not undertaken, 
could possibly lead to the loss of federal funds .128 /T_he confer -
ence committee was left with the di ﬃcult task of reconcil -
ing the Senate and House versions of S . 4—the most critical 
issue being the fate of the water quality standards initiative . 
While negotiations within the conference committee contin -
ued, Senator Muskie’s subcommittee was holding high-pro -
/f_ile hearings around the country that generated considerable 
public interest in what was happening on the water pollution 
control front in Washington, D .C.129
In September 1965, the conference committee hammered 
out compromise legislation, which adopted the requirement 
of water quality standards only for receiving waters, leaving 
the more controversial e ﬄuent standards for another day . 
/T_he conference committee bill easily passed both houses of 
Congress as the WQA .130 President Johnson quickly signed 
the WQA into law .

water-quality-standards approach to national water pollution 
control was /f_inally the centerpiece of the federal e ﬀort to con -
trol pollution in interstate waters, but the new program was 
still clearly intended to be administered by the states .132 A key 
provision of the WQA created a timetable for states to create 
ambient water quality standards for all of the nation’s inter -
state waters, which were then to be utilized by the states in 
their regulatory activities .133 Perhaps anticipating resistance 
from the states, the WQA gave the FWPCA clear authority 
to move forward if the states declined or defaulted in their 
role.134 State-created standards were subject to review and 
disapproval by the Secretary of HEW and, in the absence of 
acceptable state-created standards, the new Act authorized 
the Secretary to promulgate water quality standards for the

the battle over the inclusion of water quality standards in the

of the statute creating the standards program was so short

statute necessitated that the FWPCA provide a great deal

laws protecting environmental resources and to compel man -
dated enforcement actions . In a very real sense, the remark -
ably bold national goals set forth in the 1972 CWA were a 
/f_itting capstone to this decade of fast and furious legislative, 
executive, and judicial activism on behalf of the nation’s nat -
ural environment .
A. Reorganization  Plan Reassigns  Responsibility  for 
the FWPCA  to HEW
Considering the hard-fought reform e ﬀort that culminated 
in the WQA, one would think that Congress and other pro -
ponents of a stronger federal e ﬀort might take a breather 
from water pollution for a year or two . Instead, 1966 was 
a year of frenetic activity in the /f_ield. Before the newly cre -
ated FWPCA could settle into HEW, President Johnson 
announced a Reorganization Plan in February of 1966 that 
would move the FWPCA from HEW to the Department of 
the Interior,144 a plan strongly endorsed by both HEW Secre -
tary John W . Gardner and Interior Secretary Stewart Udall . 
On the other hand, congressional parents of the new fed -
eral water pollution agency were somewhat dismayed at the 
prospect of their cherished infant moving to, what seemed 
to them, a potentially hostile environment within Interior . 
At the hearings on the Reorganization Plan, however, Sec -
retary Udall did an impressive job of selling himself and his 
department as champions of aggressive e ﬀorts to cleanse the 
nation’s waterways .145 Accordingly, Congress took no steps to 
disapprove the plan146 and it took e ﬀect in May 1966 .
B. HEW  Issues  New Water  Quality  Guidelines  to 
States
Making good on his commitment to accelerate the tempo of 
federal activity on the water quality front, shortly after the 
FWPCA’s transfer to Interior, Secretary Udall issued to the 
states critically important guidelines for establishing water 
quality standards—as required by the 1965 Act .147 /T_hese 
guidelines were critical to ensuring that the states adopted 
more or less uniform new water quality standards because 
the provisions in the WQA were quite skeletal in their detail 
about how the standards were to be created and how they 
were to be implemented . As prescribed in the guidelines, the 
states’ /f_irst step in establishing the new water quality stan -
dards was to designate the uses intended for speci /f_ic seg -
ments of regulated waters that were to be protected by the 
WQA—“public water supplies, propagation of /f_ish and wild -
life, recreational purposes, and agricultural, industrial, and

other legitimate uses .”148 /T_he next step was to determine the 
quality of ambient waters necessary to support the identi /f_ied 
uses,149 and the third step was to create an implementation 
plan designed to achieve the water quality standards where 
they were not currently su ﬃcient to support the designated 
uses150 and to prevent degradation of waters already meeting 
the standards .151 /T_hese guidelines would generate a good deal 
of discussion—pro and con—over the next few years, but on 
/f_irst blush, they appeared to be nothing more than a consci -
entious e ﬀort to facilitate the standard-setting and enforce -
ment goals of the 1965 WQA . One month after Secretary 
Udall promulgated the guidelines, he announced his plans 
for streamlining the administration within the FWPCA 
by appointing a new commissioner who would be directly 
responsible for oversight of the entire program, which was 
reorganized into four main divisions—Technical Programs, 
Facilities Programs, R&D, and Enforcement—each headed 
by an Assistant Commissioner .152
Initially, the states varied widely in their response to the 
challenge of developing water quality standards for all inter -
state waters, but by 1967, all states had submitted proposed 
standards to the FWPCA . Nearly all the original state sub -
missions, however, were de /f_icient in some respect .153 /T_he 
WQA contained an elaborate formal process for resolving 
diﬀerences between a state and the FWPCA over the suf -
/f_iciency of state-proposed standards .154 At the end of the 
lengthy procedure, an appeal to federal court was allowed, 
and the court’s review was virtually de novo . /T_he FWPCA 
resorted to this cumbersome procedure only rarely over the 
next few years, preferring to reach negotiated settlements 
with the states .155 Given the complicated formal process and 
the continued congressional insistence that the primacy of 
state regulatory programs be preserved, it was understand -
able why federal o ﬃcials relied almost entirely on drawn-
out negotiations to bring the state submissions in line with 
federal expectations . It was a slow slog, however, and it was 
1970 before all the state standards had received prelimi -
nary approval, and then only twenty states’ standards had 
received full federal approval .156 In April 1 971 , new regula -
tions, which governed the revision of state standards that the 
FWPCA determined to be inadequate, suggested that EPA 
intended to step up the pressure on the states to upgrade the 
standards established in the /f_irst round of standard setting .157 
It is noteworthy that before the 1972 Clean Water Act, the 
federal standards program applied only to interstate waters, 
thereby leaving roughly six-sevenths158 of the nation’s waters 
unaﬀected by the water quality standards program .

Pollution  Control  Act
Early in 1966, President Johnson responded to a report 
from his Science Advisory Committee that recommended 
augmentation of the federal support of water pollution con -
trol.159 In his February 1966 message to Congress on envi -
ronmental quality, the President outlined a new initiative 
supported by the White House .160 Legislation introduced in 
both houses of Congress based on the President’s plan had 
three principle objectives: (1)  create and empower regional 
control agencies; (2)  adopt a “One Shot” policy toward grants 
to localities that would require recipients to demonstrate that 
future needs could be met by local funds; and (3)  strengthen 
federal enforcement powers in several important respects .161 
Proceeding independently, Senator Muskie introduced his 
own proposals that in one key matter were the polar opposite 
of the President’s “One Shot” idea . Muskie’s subcommittee 
had been conducting hearings around the country for three 
years, and the results of these hearings were released in a 
short report entitled “Steps to Clean Water .”162 /T_he Muskie 
proposal was premised on his subcommittee’s /f_inding that 
the largest impediment to improvement in the nation’s water 
quality was the huge backlog in funding needed to upgrade 
municipal waste treatment facilities .163 To remedy this prob -
lem, Muskie proposed a massive increase in funding for con -
struction grants to municipalities—with an authorization to 
spend six billion dollars over six years—plus another pack -
age of technical changes to greatly expedite the rate of fed -
eral funding for construction of local waste water treatment 
facilities .164
At the Senate hearings on both the Muskie bill and the 
President’s bill, the “One Shot” approach was widely criti -
cized165 an d  M us ki e ’ s  o r d e r -o f - m agni tu d e  in c r eas es  in  co n -
struction grant funding were generally applauded . As 
reported out by the Senate Committee on Public Works, 
the proposed legislation carried forward Muskie’s fund -
ing approach, watered down greatly the President’s river 
basin approach,166 and made only innocuous changes to the 
enforcement e ﬀort. Adding only a minor amendment to 
authorize more support for training technical personnel, the 
Muskie bill passed the Senate .167 When the bill went to the 
House, the House bill more or less paralleled the Senate bill 
because Representative Blatnik did not author a competitive

proposal .168 /T_he House bill reduced the funding authority, 
however, by about forty percent .169 /T_he House passed its bill, 
and a week later, a conference committee reported out a /f_inal 
bill that quickly passed both houses and was signed into law 
by President Johnson on November 3, 1966 .170
Titled the Clean Water Restoration Act of 1966, the new 
legislation amended the Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act in a number of ways, but the key provisions were mostly 
/f_inancial and were intended to speed up the states’ abilities 
to implement the new water quality standards mandate . /T_he 
1966 Act authorized substantial increases in the federal con -
struction grant program—allowing the spending of $3 .55 
billion over the next 5 /f_iscal years—and it removed any dol -
lar ceiling on individual grants .171 /T_he 1966 Act expanded 
funding to support basic research and basin-wide studies .172 
/T_he new law also expanded federal enforcement jurisdiction 
to international boundary waters, and transferred to the Sec -
retary of the Interior the responsibility for administrating the 
Oil Pollution Act .173
D. U.S. v. Standard  Oil Revitalizes  the Refuse  Act
Another event occurred in 1966, outside the legislative arena, 
that was destined to have a huge impact on the federal regu -
lation of water pollution . I n  United States v. Standard Oil 
Co., the United States Supreme Court reversed over /f_ifty 
years of precedent and interpreted the 1899 Refuse Act to 
give the Corps authority to regulate all forms of discharges 
to navigable waters, without regard to whether navigation 
might be impeded .174 /T_hus, the Supreme Court ruled that 
an accidental gasoline spill into a Florida river violated the 
Refuse Act .175 /T_he Court reexamined the legislative history 
of the Refuse Act and determined that it was meant to cover 
intentional or unintentional discharges into navigable waters 
of any form of foreign substances or pollutants, except those 
expressly excluded— /f_lows from municipal sanitary sewers 
and storm sewers .176 Further, the Court ruled that section  13 
of the Refuse Act prohibited industries from discharging into 
navigable waters any substance that could impede navigation 
or pollute the waters, unless the discharger had /f_irst obtained 
a permit from the Corps .177 Only a handful of the tens of 
thousands of industrial dischargers to navigable waters actu -
ally had such permits . V i o l a t i o n  o f  t h e  A c t  w a s  a  m i s d e -
meanor and the Act gave the Corps authority to sue in federal 
court to have unlawful discharges enjoined .178 For four years,

E. The  Water  Quality  Improvement  Act of 1970
Congressional leaders who favored a much stronger federal 
program were by no means satis /f_ied by passage of the WQA 
and the 1966 Amendments . /T_he 90th Congress, however, 
was something of an interregnum in the production of new 
water quality laws .180 Several new bills were introduced in the 
Senate in 1967 dealing with oil pollution, acid mine drain -
age, and lake pollution .181 /T_he Senate leadership consolidated 
these separate bills into S . 2760, which received a favorable 
Senate vote in December 1967 .182 In the spring of 1968, the 
House held hearings on S . 2760 and H . R. 15906, which was 
co-sponsored by Congressmen George H . Fallon and Blat -
nik.183 While awaiting action by the House, Senator Muskie’s 
subcommittee held “oversight” hearings on progress under 
the 1965 Act and the 1966 Amendments .184 Although all of 
this activity failed to produce new legislation, it did create 
some momentum for action in the 91st Congress .185
Shortly after the new Congress convened in early 1969, 
Senator Muskie introduced S . 544, an updated version of 
the bill that passed the Senate in the prior session .186 /T_he 
new Senate bill added provisions dealing with marine sanita -
tion and an expansion of federal authority over the emerging 
water quality standards .187 Hearings on the revised Muskie 
bill continued from February to May 1969 .188 In the House, 
Representatives Fallon and Blatnik each introduced bills that 
were very similar to their earlier co-sponsored bill, S . 544 
and H .R. 4148 .189 After hearings, the House Committee 
on Public Works favorably reported on H .R. 4148 and the 
House passed this bill in April 1969 .190 As the action moved 
back to the Senate, the Senate Committee on Public Works 
considered both S . 544 and H .R. 4148, and then in August 
1969, reported favorably on S . 7, a new bill containing most 
of the features of S . 544.191 /T_he Senate passed S . 7 in October 
1969, but then vacated that decision and passed an amended 
version of H .R. 4148 .192 A  c o n f e r e n c e  c o m m i t t e e  d e l i b e r -

ated for six months over the di ﬀerences between the House 
and Senate versions of the two bills before agreeing on what 
was designated as the Water Quality Improvement Act of 
1970 .193 /T_his legislation passed both houses of Congress and 
was signed into law by President Nixon in April 1970 .194
/T_he Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 represented 
the most far-reaching federal action since the 1965 Act .195 
Besides expanding federal support for existing research, train -
ing, and demonstration programs, it created a new research 
and development program for the control of acid mine drain -
age, authorized studies of water pollution in the Great Lakes, 
and provided support for Alaskan village water and sewer 
projects .196 More importantly, the 1970 Act replaced the 1924 
Oil Pollution Act with a much stricter law that imposed clear 
liability on persons owning or operating a vessel or facility 
discharging oil into navigable waters or waters of the con -
tiguous zone .197 In addition, the new oil pollution control 
law authorized the President to take direct action to remove 
oil discharged in violation of the 1970 Act and directed the 
Secretary of Interior to promulgate standards and regulations 
to prevent the discharge of sewage from watercrafts .198
Another important new wrinkle in the 1970 Act focused 
on state and federal collaboration . First, the earlier Executive 
Order mandating pollution control by federal facilities was 
legislatively rea ﬃrmed .199 Second, section  21(b) of the federal 
program was amended to require, as a prerequisite, the issu -
ance of any federal license or permit, and the state a ﬀected 
by the activity must certify that its applicable water quality 
standards will not be violated .200 /T_he amendment lacked any 
signi/f_icant changes in either the water quality standards or in 
federal enforcement powers .201
Although President Nixon generally supported most of 
the key provisions of the Water Quality Improvement Act of 
1970, he was distressed with the size of the new federal fund -
ing commitments made to the construction grant program .202 
/T_his Presidential concern over the size of the federal funding 
implications mounted over the next two years as Congress 
regularly voted to allocate much larger proportions of the 
spending authorized for local wastewater treatment facilities 
than the Administration requested . /T_his disagreement ulti -
mately led President Nixon to veto the 1972 CWA . Rather 
than incur the political costs of vetoing spending bills during 
a period of heightened environmental concern, the President 
chose simply to exercise executive discretion to avoid spend -
ing amounts in excess of what he thought prudent .203 /T_his 
practice of impounding funds Congress had appropriated

a major confrontation with Congress in the early 1970s .204
F. Inﬂuence  of the Clean  Air Act of 1970
/T_he 91st Congress enacted another major piece of environ -
mental regulation, the Clean Air Act of 1970 (“CAA”),205 
that very shortly would in /f_luence the content of the 1972 
CWA, and later interact on several fronts with the expanded 
federal water pollution control e ﬀort under the new Act . /T_he 
CAA of 1970 was a major overhaul of the Air Quality Act 
of 1967, which in turn was an upgrade of the original Clean 
Air Act passed in 1963 .206 Like the WQA of 1965, the CAA 
made ambient resource quality standards the key regula -
tory mechanism of the law .207 /T_he design of the CAA called 
for the adoption of ambient air quality standards for all of 
the nation’s air sheds to be implemented by the regulation 
of existing and future stationary sources of air pollution .208 
In addition, the CAA created long-term control programs 
to deal with air pollution caused by mobile sources .209 It is 
not within the purview of this paper to provide a detailed 
analysis of the 1970 CAA, but it is worthy of note that many 
of the same congressional leaders responsible for the ever-
expanding federal water pollution control e ﬀort, also played 
important roles in shaping the federal approach to air pollu -
tion control .210 /T_herefore, it is not surprising that some new 
provisions in the 1972 CWA (e .g., de/f_inition of point sources, 
focus on technology-based permit requirements, and autho -
rization for citizen suits) bear a strong similarity to parallel 
provisions in the CAA .211
G. President  Nixon  Takes the Initiative  and Creates  
EPA
One set of legislative proposals concerning the environment 
that the 91st Congress chose not to adopt was submitted by 
President Nixon in February 1970 .212 /T_he President’s initia -
tive was designed to substantially strengthen the enforcement 
powers of the federal agency in lieu of spending huge sums 
on federal construction grants to support the construction of 
local waste water treatment facilities .213 /T_he President later

cited Congress’s indi ﬀerence to his proposals in December 
1970 when he shocked the environmental community by 
issuing an Executive Order directing the Corps to create a 
new federal water pollution permit system to implement the 
newly revitalized 1899 Refuse Act .214
President Nixon’s involvement with environmental regu -
lation in 1970 did not stop at proposing his own legislation 
and issuing the paradigm-shifting Executive Order described 
above . In June 1970, the President announced a National Oil 
and Hazardous Materials Contingency Plan215 and, by Execu -
tive Order, delegated to various agencies enforcement  respon -
sibilities under the Plan .216 /T_his development was particularly 
noteworthy because it built on the groundwork laid out in 
the 1970 Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments 
for the federal agency to create a new program, modeled on 
the oil pollution initiative, for controlling the discharge of all 
hazardous substances to the nation’s waters .217 Also in 1970, 
President Nixon issued an Executive Order directing all fed -
eral departments to take an aggressive stance toward clean -
ing up water pollution emanating from federal facilities .218 
As noted earlier, this Executive Order was later embraced 
by Congress in the 1970 Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act amendments in which the federal agency was directed 
to assure compliance with water quality standards by fed -
eral facilities “consistent with the paramount interest of the 
United States .”219 Of greatest signi /f_icance, in July 1970, Pres -
ident Nixon proposed a new Reorganization Plan, which was 
recommended to him by his Advisory Council on Executive 
Organization . 220 /T_his Plan called for the creation of a new 
federal agency, the EPA, which would assume responsibility 
for the administration of all major federal programs having 
to do with environmental quality .221 /T_he proposed consolida -
tion of federal environmental programs would bring together 
under one roof (1)  the water pollution control program from 
the Department of the Interior; (2)  the air pollution control 
program and solid waste management from the Department 
of Health, Education and Welfare; (3)  pesticide regulation 
from the USDA; and (4)  a portion of radiation control from 
the Nuclear Regulatory Agency .222 /T_his Reorganization Plan

H. The  Short-Lived  Refuse  Act Permit  Program
Meanwhile, action was heating up on the Refuse Act front . 
/T_hanks in part to extensive publicity by Congressman Henry 
S. Reuss226 and others about the environmental enforcement 
possibilities opened by the Supreme Court’s decision in 
United States v. Standard Oil Co. ,227 environmentalists across 
the country began to push for federal legal action against 
industrial water polluters who lacked permits from the 
Corps .228 When it was discovered that the Refuse Act pro -
vided for a “bounty” award of /f_ifty percent of the /f_ine recov -
erable to citizens responsible for reporting the violation, the 
Justice Department became inundated with reports of Refuse 
Act violations by bounty-hunting environmentalists .229 As a 
result, in June 1970, the Justice Department distributed to 
U.S. Att o rn eys ar o un d th e co un try “ G ui d elin es fo r Li tiga -
tion Under the Refuse Act .”230 /T_he “Guidelines” called for 
very selective prosecution of Refuse Act violators .231 Only 
violators whose water pollution was signi /f_icant, “but not of 
a continuing nature,” were to be prosecuted .232 Furthermore, 
without express Justice Department approval, no prosecu -
tions were to be commenced against an industrial discharger 
operating under a permit from a state, a discharger currently 
engaged in a federal administrative abatement proceeding, 
or a discharger whose pollution was already the subject of 
abatement litigation .233 /T_he Justice Department’s policy, 
stated in the “Guidelines,” represented a virtually total with -
drawal of prosecutorial authority with respect to all indus -
trial dischargers .234
Congressman Reuss and environmental activists across the 
country were outraged by the Justice Department’s refusal 
to prosecute violators of the Refuse Act . In short order, a 
clever tactic emerged to circumvent the Justice Department’s 
position . Congressman Reuss and his House Government

Operations Committee touted use of the obscure qui tam  
action .235 Where available, a qui tam  action is brought by a 
private citizen to punish an unlawful act and claim a share in 
the civil or criminal /f_ine.236 /T_hus, the theory suggested, when 
the Justice Department refused to prosecute clear violations 
of the Refuse Act, the citizen watch dogs could bring qui tam  
actions to vindicate both the federal regulatory objective and 
their entitlement to the bounty . Before questions about the 
applicability of the qui tam  concept to Refuse Act violations 
could be /f_inally resolved, however, President Nixon issued 
an Executive Order on December 21, 1970, directing the 
creation of a joint Corps-EPA permit program for discharg -
ers subject to the Refuse Act—thereby rendering the issue 
moot .237
Under the Refuse Act Permit Program (“RAPP”) created 
by President Nixon’s December 1970 Executive Order and 
re/f_ined by a “Memorandum of Understanding”238 between 
the Corps and EPA published in early 1971, the Corps was 
given responsibility for “granting, denying, conditioning, 
revoking, or suspending” permits to discharge pollutants 
into navigable waters .239 In exercising these new responsibili -
ties, however, the Memorandum required the Corps to seek 
and follow EPA’s advice with respect to compliance with fed -
eral water quality standards .240 In addition, the Corps was 
expected to comply with section  21(b) of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act, which required certi /f_ication by the 
relevant state or interstate pollution control agency that the 
permit applicant’s discharge will not violate applicable water 
quality standards in interstate waters .241
EPA issued new regulations in February 1971 covering 
the mechanics of state certi /f_ication under section  21(b) .242 
Further regulations, issued in April 1971, outlined a tightly 
structured program for the issuance of Refuse Act permits .243 
/T_he permit requirement was expressly stated to apply to all 
direct or indirect discharges or deposits into a navigable 
waterway or tributary, including discharges of water at a 
temperature signi /f_icantly di ﬀerent than the ambient water .244 
/T_he new regulations seemingly expanded the considerations 
going into the issuance of RAPP permits to include /f_ish and 
wildlife protection values not re /f_lected, or inadequately pro -
tected, in the federal water quality standards .245 In addition,

supra note 7, at 556 .these regulations indicated for the /f_irst time that, consistent 
with its general administration of the federal water quality 
standards program, EPA would expect industrial polluters to 
apply secondary treatment, or its equivalent, to all of their 
wastewater discharges .246
To implement this policy, EPA planned to apply its recently 
completed studies of the state-of-the-art technology avail -
able for wastewater treatment in twenty-two industries .247 
Environmentalists complained bitterly that this regulatory 
approach violated the letter and spirit of the “no discharge” 
language of the Refuse Act, but this was to no avail in the ini -
tial RAPP planning . /T_he April 1971 regulations required all 
permit applications for existing discharges to be /f_iled by July 
1, 1971, and new dischargers to apply within 120 days prior 
to the commencement of the discharge .248 /T_his deadline was 
met by over 15,000 industrial discharges representing over 
30,000 outfall points where pollutants are discharged into 
water, and thousands of additional applications were received 
over the next few months .249
/T_he application form for a RAPP permit was so detailed 
that the Corps granted many applicants a three-month 
extension of the deadline to generate all the technical infor -
mation needed to process the application e ﬀectively .250 /T_he 
new permit program was barely underway when it was halted 
by a December 1971 federal court case brought by environ -
mentalists claiming that NEPA required the preparation of 
an EIS for each of the tens of thousands of permits under -
going review .251 At the time the program was stopped in its 
tracks—pending resolution of the issue of NEPA’s applica -
bility to the issuance of RAPP permits—only a handful of 
permits had been issued .252 Before the NEPA issue could be 
resolved in the courts, however, Congress enacted the 1972 
CWA, mooting the argument that an EIS was required for 
every RAPP permit .

253. See Andreen , /T_he Evolution of Water Pollution Control , supra note 79, at 255 .Summer 2013  HISTORY OF THE 1972 CLEAN WATER ACT  95
on air pollution control with the passage of the CAA in 1970, 
Muskie’s Senate subcommittee turned its attention once 
again to water pollution in 1971 . Very early in the congressio -
nal session, Senator Muskie introduced legislation to extend 
federal authority to all navigable waters of the United States, 
to adopt ambitious new goals for eliminating pollutants from 
the nation’s waters, and to radically reform the federal regula -
tory structure for controlling water pollution . Muskie’s pro -
posal called for establishing a national goal—“no pollutant 
discharge”—to be achieved by adoption of technology-based 
eﬄuent limitations . His bill also greatly sti ﬀened federal 
enforcement powers, authorized citizen suits, and ramped up 
federal grants for the construction of wastewater treatment 
plants .254 In February 1971, Senator Cooper introduced a 
Senate bill embodying President Nixon’s legislative propos -
als, which generally tracked the Muskie blueprint on key 
points, but were slightly more conservative on the regulatory 
side and much less generous in the /f_inancing of construction 
grants .255
/T_he Senate subcommittee held hearings on both bills in 
March 1971;256 it then worked diligently on the /f_inal shape 
of the bill, which it published as a working draft in July .257 In 
its ambition, the subcommittee’s draft bill went beyond both 
the original Muskie bill and the Administration’s bill . /T_he 
draft subcommittee bill extended federal jurisdiction to all of 
the nation’s navigable waters, as did both of the earlier pro -
posals, but to the delight of the environmental community, 
it also expanded the reach of the Refuse Act permit require -
ment to municipal wastewater outlets as well as industrial 
discharges .258 /T_he draft bill retained the idea of the Refuse 
Act permits, but reassigned responsibility for issuing the 
permits from the Corps to EPA .259 /T_he permit scheme envi -
sioned in the draft bill would require secondary treatment 
of all wastewater discharge to navigable waters .260 Further, 
permitted dischargers could not violate federal water quality 
standards or any requirements in state water quality certi /f_i-
cations .261 /T_he draft bill contemplated higher levels of e ﬄu-
ent standards for new sources of pollutant discharges, and 
prohibited certain types of toxic discharges .262 /T_he draft bill 
also substantially strengthened EPA’s enforcement powers

other nonconventional pollutants) .and authorized citizen suits . Finally, the draft bill pegged the 
funding for the construction grant program at three billion 
dollars per year for /f_ive years .263 At hearings on the subcom -
mittee’s draft bill, industry and business trade groups severely 
criticized the proposal, but shortly after the comment period 
expired, the subcommittee recommended the bill to the full 
Senate Public Works Committee .264 Two months later, the 
Public Works Committee unanimously voted to report a 
remarkably revised bill to the Senate /f_loor.265
A.  The  Senate  Bill Shifts the Regulatory  Mechanism  
to Nationwide  Efﬂuent  Standards
/T_he revised legislation authored by the Senate Public Works 
Committee adopted an entirely di ﬀerent approach to water 
pollution control—regulation grounded in technology-based 
eﬄuent standards applied uniformly across industries of the 
same type .266 /T_his was indeed a sea change in the national 
strategy for dealing with water pollution . /T_he Senate commit -
tee deemed the existing water quality standards insu ﬃcient 
for the task of upgrading and protecting the quality of Amer -
ica’s waters for two primary reasons . First, water quality stan -
dards inherently recognized the right of polluters to rely on the 
assimilative capacity of the public’s waters to dilute their waste 
so long as the discharges did not impair the quality of the water 
for existing uses .267 In the Senate bill, dilution was expressly 
rejected as a solution to the nation’s worsening water pollution 
problem .268 Second, the Senate bill characterized enforcement 
against polluters under the water-quality-standards regime as 
often impracticable, and sometimes impossible, because of the 
diﬃculty in proving that a speci /f_ic discharge was the cause of a 
violation of the relevant water quality standard .269 By contrast, 
the Senate committee projected that pollution control o ﬃcers 
monitoring waterways, detecting pollution conditions, and 
bringing enforcement actions against violators of technology-
based e ﬄuent limitations would be much more e ﬀective in 
eliminating water pollution .270
/T_he Senate committee bill did not so much abandon 
the water quality standards established by the 1965 WQA 
as it moved beyond them to place the primary regulatory 
focus directly on the wastewater stream of each individual 
discharger . In S . 2770, the existing water quality standards 
program was not altered, except to employ it in a new way 
as a mechanism for detecting cases where initial e ﬄu-
ent standards were insu ﬃcient to achieve required levels of 
water quality in waters receiving the regulated e ﬄuent.271

/T_he implicit rationale for uniform e ﬄuent limits, carefully 
tailored to the technologies available to each speci /f_ic indus -
try, was promoting nationwide fairness among competitors 
in the same industry . Uniform e ﬄuent limits would elimi -
nate all polluting discharges to water, without regard to the 
quality of the local receiving waters . /T_hus, nationally-uni -
form technology-based e ﬄuent limitations would eliminate 
the competitive advantage of industries located in relatively 
clean water areas using the assimilative capacity of the pub -
lic’s waters to dilute their polluting discharges .272
Henceforth, relying on the Refuse Act model—but 
extending its reach to all the navigable waters of the United 
States and their tributaries, territorial waters, and the Great 
Lakes—all discharges of pollutants into waters would be pro -
hibited unless authorized by a permit issued by EPA under 
a new NPDES .273 Like the administration of water quality 
standards under the 1965 WQA, states were expected to 
administer the new e ﬄuent-based permit system eventu -
ally, but the states had to /f_irst qualify for EPA’s delegation of 
authority to them .274 /T_he new permit system would require 
all dischargers of pollutants to apply at least secondary treat -
ment or “best practical” control technology (“BPT”) to their 
wastewater streams by speci /f_ied deadlines .275 Phase I would 
impose a 1974 deadline for municipal wastewater treatment 
plants, and a 1976 deadline for industrial polluters .276 Phase 
II would require industrial sources to eliminate all pollutant 
discharges by 1981, unless this goal was not attainable at a 
reasonable cost, in which case the industrial polluter was to 
employ the “best available technology” (“BAT”) .277 All new 
sources of industrial water pollution were required to meet 
the BAT requirement immediately in order to qualify for 
a permit .278 During Phase I, if e ﬄuent limits based on sec -
ondary treatment or BPT were not su ﬃcient to meet federal 
water quality standards or state standards adopted for intra -
state waters, regulators were required to tighten the e ﬄuent 
limits in the permits issued .279 /T_he same rule applied in Phase 
II with respect to e ﬄuent limits based on BAT, but only after 
the costs and bene /f_its of the higher restriction had been con -
sidered by the regulating agency .280
/T_he Senate committee’s bill also stated an unequivo -
cal national goal of “No Discharge” of pollutants to water

281 /T_he bill called for all of the nation’s waters to be “ /f_ishable

“No Discharge” goal by 1985 . It also called for the height -
ened regulation elimination of all discharges of toxic pollut -
ants.282 Not surprisingly, the “No Discharge” and “ /f_ishable 
and swimmable” goals and the timetables for achieving them 
were among the most controversial aspects of the proposed 
legislation . /T_he committee bill also broke with the tradi -
tional deference to state primacy in enforcement matters .283 
Besides placing primary reliance on federally-established 
eﬄuent limitations, the proposal would streamline and 
greatly strengthen federal enforcement authority .284 Many of 
the procedural barriers found in the former legislation were 
removed, and EPA was granted broader authority to employ 
administrative action and given much more ready access to 
courts .285 C i t i z e n  s u i t s ,  m o d e l e d  o n  t h e  1 9 7 0  CAA  p r o v i -

Stennis, introduced an amendment, over Senator Muskie’s 
objection, to restore to the Corps’ sole permitting authority 
over the discharge of dredged and /f_ill materials into navi -
gable waters .288 /T_he parties quickly reached a compromise, 
however, to leave the permit authority over dredged materials 
with EPA, which would issue permits unless it found that 
environmental harm would result .289 /T_he /f_inal Senate vote

1972, at 1414 (1973) .Summer 2013  HISTORY OF THE 1972 CLEAN WATER ACT  97
B.  The  House  Tries to Restore  the Status  Quo
/T_he Nixon Administration was greatly frustrated by its 
inability to push back against the Senate bill during the 
hearings in that chamber, and looked to the House to restore 
primary authority to the states, water down the federal 
enforcement provisions, and reduce the federal spending 
authorized .291 A t  /f_irst, the House Public Works Commit -
tee was reluctant to reopen hearings for fear of backlash 
from the environmental community, which was enthusias -
tic toward the Senate legislation . Even though many mem -
bers of the House committee believed that the Senate had 
gone overboard with its radical changes in the strategy for 
combating water pollution, they were also growing tired of 
playing the role of stalking horse for the Nixon Administra -
tion when it came to correcting the excesses of the Senate in 
championing environmental reforms .292
Congressman Blatnik, who chaired the House Commit -
tee on Public Works, had long been a stalwart supporter of 
greater water pollution control powers in the federal agency 
and was personally reluctant to provide the Nixon Adminis -
tration a forum for savaging the Senate bill .293 At this critical 
moment, however, Blatnik su ﬀered a heart attack, removing 
him from the fray . Shortly thereafter, four days of hearings 
were scheduled during December 1971 .294 As expected, crit -
ics of the Senate bill came out of the woodwork to attack it on 
a number of fronts, but EPA Director William Ruckelshaus 
and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, both of whom 
questioned the wisdom of adopting a national goal of no 
discharge of pollutants to water, expressed the most serious 
concerns and characterized the e ﬀort as the waste of billions 
of dollars to try to reach an unachievable goal .295 Rockefeller 
estimated the national cost at as much as three trillion dol -
lars.296 /T_he House committee announced shortly after the 
hearings a lengthy list of changes it intended to make to the 
Senate bill and then turned over the project of rewriting the 
Senate bill to committee sta ﬀ.
/T_he House released its version of the water pollution reform 
legislation in March 1972 .297 /T_he new House bill retained 
the basic format of the Senate bill, but adopted many changes 
that reduced the force of the reforms . For example, the House 
bill retained the BPT goal of 1976, but as to the more strin -
gent 1981 and 1985 goals, the House bill required that they 
would not take e ﬀect unless a National Academy of Sciences 
study con /f_irmed that the goals were desirable and achievable 
at a reasonable cost .298 Whatever the study found, the goals

Academy’s report, Congress rea ﬃrmed the goals legislative -
ly.299 /T_he House bill also greatly weakened the EPA’s role in 
administering the permit system, and created a special permit 
authority in the Corps for disposal of dredged spoil .300 /T_he 
one place where the House bill surprisingly built directly on 
the Senate bill was in construction grants, where the House 
committee bumped the Senate recommendation of fourteen 
billion dollars up to twenty billion dollars .301 Needless to say, 
the White House was apoplectic .302 At the urging of a large 
coalition of environmental groups, Congressmen John Ding -
ell and Reuss sponsored a series of amendments on the House 
/f_loor intended to restore some key provisions in the Senate 
bill, but all these amendments failed and the House bill was 
passed in the form the committee had written it .303 A confer -
ence committee was convened in mid-May of 1972 .
C.  The  Conference  Committee  Recommends  the 
Senate’s  Version  of Reform
When the conference committee had not come to agree -
ment on a compromise bill by September, concern developed 
that another Congressional session might pass without new 
legislation dealing with the growing water pollution prob -
lem. Public pressure mounted for the adoption of some 
type of new water pollution control legislation, and at the 
end of September, the conference committee unanimously 
recommended a bill to be voted on one last time by both 
the House and Senate .304 /T_he bill crafted by the conference 
committee exhibited compromise on nearly all the major 
issues between the Senate and House bills, but on balance, 
it retained the essence of the Senate’s approach . /T_he House’s 
preference for expressly retaining the existing water quality 
standards program was incorporated into the new bill, but 
in a way in which the ambient standards could be used to 
reinforce the new e ﬄuent standards and to deal with pollu -
tion from sources other than dischargers regulated under the 
new NPDES permit system .305 /T_he Senate and the House 
compromised on the dredged spoil issue by leaving the per -
mit authority with EPA, but giving the Corps a direct say 
in whether the permits should be issued or not .306 /T_he con -
ference committee bill resolved the di ﬀerences between the 
House and Senate in construction grant funding by setting 
the authorization /f_igure at eighteen billion dollars over four 
years, which was closer to the spending the House favored .307

/T_he White House accepted all of the provisions in the con -
ference committee bill except the construction grant fund -
ing authorization . After the conference committee bill sailed 
through both houses of Congress overwhelmingly on Octo -
ber 4, 1972,308 President Nixon delayed signing it as long as 
he could and then vetoed it . In his veto message, Nixon criti -
cized Congress for what the President thought was exorbitant 
spending on the construction grant program, stating “even if 
the Congress defaults in its obligations to taxpayers – I shall 
not default in mine .”309 Only one day later, both chambers of 
Congress easily overrode the President’s veto .310 /T_he CWA of 
1972 thus became law on October 18, 1972 .311
VI. Tracing the Origins of Key Provisions of 
the CWA
As was true with most of the seven federal statutes dealing 
with water pollution control that preceded it, the 1972 CWA 
contained numerous provisions that were not strictly regula -
tory in their thrust .312 Identi /f_ied and discussed brie /f_ly below 
are twenty key provisions of the CWA that form the core 
of the regulatory scheme imbedded in the 1972 Act . /T_hese 
provisions were carefully constructed and interconnected 
to work together to create a coherent and uni /f_ied federal 
approach to controlling water pollution moving forward, 
with the ultimate goal of eliminating the discharge of all pol -
lutants to the nation’s waters .
A. Section  101: Declaration  of Goals and Policy
With the 1972 CWA, Congress dramatically changed the 
course of water pollution control in the United States by 
adopting bold new goals and policies and a new implementa -

it aﬀected stream /f_lows); id. § 103, 33 U .S.C. § 1253 (2006) (encouraging 
interstate compacts and uniform state laws regarding water pollution control); 
id. § 104, 33 U .S.C. § 1254 (2006) (establishing cooperative programs for re -

§ 1255 (2006) (creating a grant program to the states to promote a demon -

U.S.C. § 1256 (2006) (authorizing grants to state and interstate programs 
to support their operation); id. § 107, 33 U .S.C. § 1257 (2006) (authorizing 
grants to support demonstration projects to eliminate or control acid mine

programs for improving water quality in the Great Lakes); id. §§ 111–12, 33 
U.S.C. §§ 1261–62 (2006) (authorizing EPA to award scholarships to un -
dergraduates interested in careers as water pollution control personnel, and 
de/f_ined the terms to apply to such a scholarship program); id. § 113, 33 U .S.C. 
§ 1263 (2006) (authorizing demonstration projects for controlling wastewater 
discharges in Alaskan villages); id. § 114, 33 U .S.C. § 1264 (2006) (authoriz -

rying forward and expanded the federal construction grants program for mu -
nicipal wastewater treatment facilities); id. §§ 208–09, 33  U.S.C. §§ 1288–89 
(2006) (calling for the development of area-wide waste treatment management 
plans); id. § 312, 33 U .S.C. § 1322 (2006) (dealing with marine sanitation 
devices) .tion strategy focused on limiting pollutants at their source . 
Section  101(a) emphatically states that the objective of the 
1972 CWA is to “restore and maintain the chemical, physi -
cal, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters .”313 /T_he 
words “restore and maintain” and “integrity” have enormous 
importance in understanding and interpreting the complex 
structure of the CWA . /T_hese key terms form the foundation 
for /f_inding congressional intent in the CWA to support con -
tinuation of the “nondegradation policy .”314 Recognizing a 
nondegradation policy means that dischargers are forbidden 
to lower the ambient quality of any waterway below what it 
was at the time the law took e ﬀect. Such a policy goal was not 
explicitly stated anywhere in the language of the CWA, but 
EPA has implemented this policy since 1966 .315
Of equal consequence was the statement of three vital 
national goals to be achieved under the Act: (1)  “discharge 
of pollutants into navigable waters be eliminated by 1985;”316 
(2) “wherever attainable, an interim goal of water quality 
which provides for the protection and propagation of /f_ish, 
shell/f_ish, and wildlife, and provides for recreation in and on 
the water be achieved by July 1, 1983;”317 and (3)  “the dis -
charge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts be prohibited .”318 
/T_he speci /f_ic formulation of the three goals quoted above 
originated in the Senate bill, S . 2770, introduced in 1971 
by Senator Muskie .319 /T_he ambitious goals set forth in sec -
tion 101(a) of the 1972 CWA, however, found their philo -
sophical origins in the 1899 Refuse Act, which the Supreme 
Court interpreted in 1966 to prohibit all industrial discharges 
to navigable waters without a permit from the Corps during 
the 1960s .320 In the course of adapting the Refuse Act’s regu -
latory approach to modern pollution control methods, wisely 
or unwisely, Congress expanded the Refuse Act rules to cover 
all dischargers, and made the achievement of the objective of 
zero discharges of pollutants into water a durable long-range 
national goal .
B. Section  502(7):  EPA Jurisdiction
Section  502(7) of the CWA expressly de /f_ines “navigable 
waters” as “the waters of the United States .”321 /T_his precise 
language originated in the 1972 conference committee that 
reconciled S . 2770 and the House amendments to the Sen -
ate bill,322 but its roots can be traced all the way back to the 
313. CWA §  101(a), 33 U .S.C. § 1251(a) (2006) . /T_he statement of purposes in 
prior federal water pollution statutes began either with pledges to preserve state 
responsibilities, or to establish national policy for the prevention, control, and 
abatement of water pollution . See id. § 101(b), 33 U .S.C. § 1251(b) .

1899 Refuse Act, which conferred on the Corps regulatory 
authority over the navigable waters of the United States .323 
Even earlier in the 19th century, the Supreme Court gave the 
legal concept of navigability a broad interpretation, which 
has guided federal law ever since .324
Earlier versions of the Federal Water Pollution Con -
trol Act conferred federal jurisdiction over only “interstate 
waters,”325 and the drafters of the CWA intended to substan -
tially broaden the federal authority to abate water pollution . 
In 1975, the Supreme Court interpreted the CWA’s claim of 
jurisdiction over “the waters of the United States” to mean 
that Congress intended to assert the fullest range of federal 
powers in relation to the “Commerce Clause,”326 citing con -
sistent statements to that e ﬀect from the congressional hear -
ings on the bills that became the 1972 CWA .327
C. Sections  301(a),  304, 502(12),  and 502(6):  
“Unlawful”  to “Discharge  a Pollutant”  Into “the 
Waters  of the United  States”
Section  301(a) states that “[e]xcept as in compliance with” 
certain enumerated sections of the CWA, “discharge of any 
pollutant by any person shall be unlawful .”328 /T_his precise 
language was /f_irst included in S . 2770, introduced in 1971 . 
Except for a minor wording change by the House, it remained 
intact throughout the process of the CWA becoming law .329 
Section  502(12) de /f_ines “discharge of a pollutant” to mean 
“(A) any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from 
any point source, and (B)  any addition of any pollutant to the 
waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point 
source other than a vessel or other /f_loating craft .”330 Read 
in combination, these sections clearly stated that, without a 
NPDES permit setting forth a technology-based e ﬄuent lim -
itation, all discharges of pollutants to U .S. waters were for -
bidden . /T_he CWA represented a dramatic change from prior 
federal regulation under the Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act, which had focused solely on protecting the quality of 
the receiving waters, not the quality of the discharges into 
such waters .331 Under the CWA, Congress intended for both 
forms of regulation to be utilized and interconnected .
Section  502(6) of the CWA provides a comprehensive def -
inition of the term “pollutant .”332 /T_he section lists nineteen 
types of materials legally regarded as pollutants if discharged

pollutant without compliance with the CWA is unlawful and 
the careful de /f_inition of what constitutes a pollutant provided 
context and content to the new policy goal of prohibiting 
all discharges of pollutants to the nation’s waters by 1985 .334 
/T_he de/f_inition of “pollutant” comes from S . 2770, except 
again, the House made some minor wording changes .335 Not 
surprisingly, even the seemingly exhaustive list of potential 
pollutants in section  502(6) did not forestall litigation over 
exactly what was meant by some of the general terms used .336
D. “Cooperative  Federalism”
/T_he 1972 CWA carried forward for yet one more round 
of reform the longstanding congressional commitment 
expressed in the original 1948 Act to “recognize, preserve, 
and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the 
States in controlling water pollution .”337 /T_hus, the CWA pro -
vided that the primary responsibilities for the continuation 
and expansion of the existing water quality standards pro -
gram and the ultimate administration of the new NPDES 
permit program were to lie with the states .338 As with the 
adoption and implementation of water quality standards 
under the 1965 WQA, states desiring to assume responsibil -
ity for issuing and enforcing their own permits under the 
NPDES program were invited to apply for EPA approval . 
Delegation of responsibility for the new permit program was 
subject to a battery of speci /f_ic authorization requirements 
that set a solid federal /f_loor with respect to state program 
integrity .339 If a state did not request implementation author -
ity, or could not meet the federal requirements, EPA would 
administer the federally required NPDES program within 
the state .340 /T_his delegation process was /f_irst prescribed in 
S. 2770, but the House changed it slightly to grant the states 
more freedom to operate the permit program locally, subject 
to EPA oversight, including giving EPA the power to veto a 
proposed permit if the state issuance process did not meet 
federal requirements and guidelines .341

E. Sections  301(b),  402, and 502(14):  Regulation  of 
Point Sources
Recognition of the dichotomy between point sources and 
nonpoint sources was long a part of the better state water 
pollution permit programs around the country, but it was not 
until section  502(14) of the CWA that the term was expressly 
de/f_ined at the federal level . /T_his de /f_inition was necessary 
because the new NPDES permit program focused regulation 
directly and exclusively on point sources .342 Point sources, 
as de /f_ined in the CWA, refer to “any discernible, con /f_ined 
and discrete conveyance, including, but not limited to, any 
[twelve enumerated possible sources], from which pollutants 
are or may be discharged .”343 /T_he list of twelve types of point 
sources in the statutory de /f_inition was purposefully made 
non-inclusive .344 Congress included this de /f_inition in S . 2770 
and did not change it during the legislative process .345
F. Sections  208 and 304(e):  Managing  Nonpoint  
Sources
In contrast to the elaborate NPDES permit program estab -
lished in the CWA to deal with point sources of pollution, 
Congress largely left the creation of active programs to con -
trol nonpoint sources to the states, which were tasked to 
continue to assess and suggest management strategies for 
the control of nonpoint sources of water pollution . N o n -
point sources include all sources of water pollution that do 
not emanate from “any discernible, con /f_ined, and discrete 
conveyance,” such as run-o ﬀ pollution from construction 
sites, agriculture cropland and animal production, mining, 
silviculture, and pollution caused by salt water intrusion 
and various types of facilities altering the /f_low or circula -
tion of surface or ground waters that are not subject to the 
NPDES permit requirement .346 Six short subsections of sec -
tion 208 for the /f_irst time included requirements that states 
identify and begin to develop methods to control nonpoint 
sources of water pollution from speci /f_ic activities .347 /T_hese 
same six most prominent sources of nonpoint water pollution 
are also cited in section  304(e), where the CWA directs the 
EPA Administrator to disseminate information—including 
guidelines for identifying and evaluating nonpoint sources—
and suggest “processes, procedures, and methods to control”

346. See 41 Fed . Reg . 24,710 (June 18, 1976) (to be codi /f_ied at 40 C .F.R. pt 
124.85). In response to public comments, the EPA identi /f_ied the character -
istics of nonpoint sources of water pollution: “(i) /T_he pollutants discharged 
are induced by natural processes, including precipitation, seepage, percollation 
[sic], and runo ﬀ; (ii) /T_he pollutants discharged are not traceable to any discrete 
or identi /f_iable facility; and (iii) /T_he pollutants discharged are better controlled 
through the utilization of best management practices, including process and 
planning techniques .” Id.

sources originated as section  209 of S . 2770, and the confer -
ence committee embellished and reorganized it to produce 
sections  208 and 304(e) of the CWA .349
/T_he pressure on states and EPA to get the NPDES per -
mit program up and running for tens of thousands of point 
sources of pollution, however, meant that dealing with non -
point sources was more or less put o ﬀ for another day, which 
turned out to be another decade or two . Another classic fed -
eralism issue that kept rearing its head whenever there was 
serious talk of controlling nonpoint sources was the claim 
most sources of nonpoint pollution were so uniquely local 
that managing their control was better left to states and local 
units of government .350 A push in the 1980s to accelerate the 
process of controlling nonpoint sources led to the adoption in 
1987 of new CWA section  319.351 With little funding avail -
able and no direct federal enforcement powers over nonpoint 
sources, however, nonpoint sources of pollution continue 
to make a huge and largely unregulated contribution to the 
nation’s water pollution problems .
G. Sections  301, 302, and 304: Technology-Based  
Efﬂuent  Standards
/T_he use of e ﬄuent standards as the primary mechanism to 
control water pollution was proposed and rejected time and 
again in congressional debates during the 1960s . Eﬄuent 
limitations did not become the primary engine to drive the 
federal NPDES program until the adoption of section  302 
of the 1972 CWA .352 In the course of developing the e ﬄu-
ent-standards approach to water quality control, Congress 
asserted that the ambient standards established for receiv -
ing waters had proved de /f_icient in improving water quality 
because it was too di ﬃcult to translate them into precise 
permit limitations on dischargers that would be defendable 
in court .353 /T_he enforcement di ﬃculty stemmed from there 
being no workable models for determining the precise rela -
tionship between speci /f_ic discharges and ambient water qual -
ity.354 After directing EPA to establish e ﬄuent limitations for 
all point sources, including POTWs,355 and to institute time -
tables for their achievement, section  302(e) provided that 
“[e]ﬄuent limitations established pursuant to this section or 
section  302 of this Act shall be applied to all point sources

of discharge of pollutants in accordance with the provisions 
of this Act .”356 /T_he idea of the new technology-based direct 
regulation of point sources of pollution discharge origi -
nated in the bill proposed by the Senate subcommittee in 
1971,357 when, at Senator Muskie’ s urging, the subcommit -
tee adopted a new “no entitlement to discharge” philosophy 
toward polluters .358 Starting with the 1972 CWA, polluters 
were no longer allowed to use the assimilative capacity of 
receiving waters to dilute polluting discharges . Instead, the 
CWA turned to nationally uniform technology-based e ﬄu-
ent standards for “categories and classes” of point sources as 
the primary basis for requirements to be written into the new 
NPDES permits .359 /T_his was a strategy deliberately designed 
to remove possible competitive advantages enjoyed by pollut -
ers in relatively clean water areas .
/T_he CWA, according to prescribed timetables for com -
pliance, required all point source dischargers to apply speci -
/f_ied levels and types of treatment to their wastewater streams 
based on practicable technology tailored to each industry, 
as determined by EPA scientists .360 /T_he conference commit -
tee slightly adjusted the timetables, but otherwise, the grand 
design proposed in S . 2770 in 1971 ultimately became the 
regulatory centerpiece of the CWA .361
H. Section  402: NPDES  Permit  Program
/T_he NPDES permit system clearly is based on express new 
statutory language in section  402 of the 1972 CWA, but its 
philosophical origins reach back to the 1899 Refuse Act’s 
prohibition of all industrial discharges to navigable waters 
and the revitalization of the Refuse Act by the U .S. Supreme 
Court in 1966 .362 O n ce th e la w /f_irmly established that no 
industrial plant could discharge any form of pollutant into 
navigable waters without a permit from the Corps, some -
thing had to be done to legalize the tens of thousands of 
industrial discharges taking place around the nation . /T_he 
confusion surrounding the litigation halting the RAPP cre -
ated in 1970 by President Nixon’s Executive Order, which 
assigned authority for administering the embryonic national 
eﬄuent permit program to the newly-created EPA,363 led 
Congress to outlaw all discharges to navigable waters in the 
CWA .364 /T_he CWA terminated EPA’s authority for the issu -
ance of discharge permits under the Refuse Act, and cre -
ated a new and comprehensive permit program to be run

I. Sections  303 and 302: Ambient  Water  Quality  
Standards
/T_he 1965 WQA mandated that all states develop a water 
quality standards program requiring the classi /f_ication of all 
interstate waters with respect to speci /f_ic intended uses, the 
creation of water quality criteria adequate to protect those 
uses, and a plan to implement the standards .368 /T_he WQA 
water quality standards were just beginning to be imple -
mented by the states when the CWA made its dramatic 
change to e ﬄuent limitations as the primary engine to power 
federal regulation . Section  303 of the 1972 CWA retained the 
water quality standards structure as a backup to reinforce the 
NPDES permit system and expanded the program to require 
states to adopt and enforce water quality standards for all 
intrastate waters .369 Section  303 was not a part of S . 2770, as 
the Senate committee was determined to emphasize its new 
eﬄuent standards, but a House amendment restored and 
expanded the existing water quality standards program .370 
/T_he most important expansion of section  303 required the 
states to create water quality standards for their intrastate 
waters .371
Section  302 of the Act created new authority to adopt 
more demanding e ﬄuent limitations for portions of navi -
gable waters where the existing e ﬄuent limitations will 
not accomplish the attainment or maintenance of estab -
lished water quality standards .372 Section  302 originated in 
S. 2770 and was only modi /f_ied by the conference committee

J. Section  303(d):  Total Maximum  Daily Loads
Although not formally recognized by EPA as a viable water 
pollution control strategy until forced to do so as a result 
of litigation in 1984,375 the framework for establishing total 
maximum daily loads (“TMDL”) for waters not meeting 
ambient water quality standards was nevertheless expressly 
built into section  303 of the 1972 CWA . Early in their res -
urrection from obscurity, environmental scholars described 
TMDLs as the “sleeping giant” of the CWA .376 In part, this 
mantle was based on the recognition that the establishment 
of TMDLs was one place where nonpoint sources could be 
taken into account in calculating the permissible loading .377 
Section  303(d)(1)(A) of the 1972 Act required states to iden -
tify all waters for which secondary treatment by POTWs and 
BPT by industrial dischargers would not achieve compliance 
with local water quality standards .378 Once states identi /f_ied 
such waters, they were to “establish priority rankings for such 
waters, taking into account the severity of the pollution and 
the uses to be made of such waters .”379 /T_hese rankings were 
to provide the basis for the development of TMDLs for any 
pollutants identi /f_ied by EPA as suitable for calculation in this 
context . Section  303(d)(1)(C) then expressly provides that the 
“total maximum daily load  . . . shall be established at a level 
necessary to implement the applicable water quality stan -
dards with seasonal variations and a margin of safety which 
takes into account any lack of knowledge concerning the rela -
tionship between e ﬄuent limitations and water quality .”380 
A special provision for regulating thermal discharges is also 
included in this section, particularly as necessary to protect 
/f_ish, shell /f_ish, and wildlife populations .381 As with the rest of 
section  303, this procedure for establishing TMDLs origi -
nated in the House, with the conference committee incorpo -
rating the procedure into the /f_inal legislation .382
K. Sections  402 and 301(b)(1)(B):  Publicly  Owned  
Treatment  Works
“POTW” was the term used for the /f_irst time in the 1972 
CWA to describe municipal wastewater treatment plants and 
other water pollution control facilities owned and operated by 
governmental units .383 POTWs had long been the recipients

L. Sections  301(b)  and 306: Progressive  and New 
Source  Treatment  Requirements  in NPDES  Permits
/T_he concept of progressive improvement in the quality of an 
environmental resource was already part of several federal 
regulatory regimes prior to the 1972 CWA . Most notably, the 
CAA required the creation of primary air quality standards 
to be achieved in three years, and secondary standards to be 
achieved in a “reasonable time .”390 Prior to the CWA, most 
state water pollution control e ﬀorts focused their resources 
on upgrading POTWs to the level of providing secondary 
treatment of all the wastewater they received . /T_herefore, the 
CWA’s requirement of secondary treatment in all POTWs 
nationwide by 1977391 was not a troublesome mandate for 
the a ﬀected local governments to accept . Even with the huge 
increase CWA provided in construction grant funding, how -
ever, meeting the 1977 deadline meant working with a very 
tight timetable for many municipalities . /T_he idea of moving 
POTWs to more advanced treatment across time was also 
easy to understand as a control strategy, if not necessarily 
easy to implement . Within the reasonably foreseeable future, 
the Congress expected all POTWs move up from secondary 
treatment to advanced levels of treatment utilizing the best 
available technology .392 /T_his was all part of the original sec -
tion 301 as proposed in S . 2770 .393

1608–10  (1973 ).Summer 2013  HISTORY OF THE 1972 CLEAN WATER ACT  103
To move the quality of the nation’s waters toward the 
ambitious goals set in the CWA, it was imperative that the 
CWA also adopt parallel and progressive technology-based 
treatment standards for industrial polluters . Between 1972 
and 1977 , the CWA called for industry e ﬄuent standards in 
NPDES permits that re /f_lected the BPT currently available 
for the pollutants discharged by each industry .394 Not later 
than 1983, Congress required industrial dischargers’ e ﬄu-
ent permit requirements to be upgraded to BAT, consistent 
with speci /f_ied technological-feasibility and economic-sus -
tainability factors .395 Again, these requirements for industrial 
dischargers, and the time tables for achieving them, both 
originated in S . 2770, but the conference committee changed 
the dates to the /f_inal 1977 and 1983 deadlines .396 Congress 
required new point sources of industrial discharge to meet 
“national standards of performance”—to be established by 
the EPA—based on the best available demonstrated technol -
ogy, processes, operating methods, or other alternatives—
including, where practicable, a standard permitting “no 
discharge of pollutants .”397 /T_he higher level of performance 
expected of new sources of industrial pollutants originated in 
S. 2770 and was carried forward in the /f_inal legislation with 
very minor edits .398
/T_he story of how these relatively simple requirements later 
morphed into a dichotomy between “conventional” pollut -
ants required to employ “best conventional treatment”399 
and “nonconventional” pollutants, for which other and var -
ied standards were applicable, is too long and complicated 
to recount here . /T_he same holds true for the role ultimately 
played by “variances” granted to polluters for whom no tech -
nology-based e ﬄuent standards had been promulgated, or 
for good reasons, who currently could not meet the standards 
applicable to their discharges .400
M. Section  307(b),  (c) and (d): Pretreatment  Programs
/T_he idea of controlling some industrial wastes by running 
them through the treatment processes on a POTW was well 
established within some state programs prior to 1972 .401 At 
the federal level, prior to the CWA, the practice of treating 
industrial discharges in municipal waste treatment works 
received recognition primarily in the approval of construc -
tion grants for so-called joint pollution control facilities .

requirements for indirect point sources, including many 
diﬀerent types of industrial wastewater streams discharged

N. Section  101(a):  “Maintain  . . . Integrity”  = The 
Nondegradation  Policy
Unlike in EPA’s administration of the CAA, which required 
a Supreme Court decision404 to force the federal agency to 
implement a “no signi /f_icant deterioration policy,” nondeg -
radation has consistently been an element of the water pol -
lution regulatory structure since the implementation of the 
1965 WQA . Guidelines issued by the FWPCA in 1966,405 
con/f_irmed and modi /f_ied by a policy statement by Interior 
Secretary Udall in 1968,406 made clear that the federal water 
pollution program was committed to the prevention of deg -
radation of waters already meeting or exceeding federal water 
quality standards . Even though Congress did not see /f_it to 
include an express nondegradation policy in the 1972 CWA 
reforms, in new water quality guidelines issued in January 
1973, EPA stated that the antidegradation requirements pre -
viously adopted would remain in force .407 /T_his determina -
tion to continue the prior policy was presumably based on 
the prime directive in section  101(a) that the CWA’s purpose 
was to “restore and maintain” water quality integrity in the 
nation’s waters .408 It was not until 1975, however, after a 
skirmish with the National Resources Defense Council over 
possible litigation409 concerning the nondegradation policy, 
that EPA published regulations clearly giving legal content 
to the nondegradation policy .410 Although it is sometimes 
claimed that the nondegradation policy in water pollution 
control was based on the “no signi /f_icant deterioration” lan -
guage in the 1970 CAA, the reverse is more likely true . As 
noted in the earlier discussion of the 1965 WQA, the fed -

Congress /f_irst introduced the concept of state certi /f_ication 
of federal licenses or permits in the Water Quality Improve -
ment Act of 1970 .413 /T_he idea was that before a federal license 
or permit is issued for activities that might adversely impact 
a state’s water quality, the state a ﬀected must formally cer -
tify to the federal agency issuing the license or permit that 
its water quality standards will not be threatened .414 /T_he 
original Senate bill S . 2770 carried forward the certi /f_ication 
requirement and the conference committee retained it in the 
/f_inal legislation .415 Section  401 of the CWA incorporated the 
certi/f_ication requirement fully, and the more expansive de /f_i-
nition of navigable waters in CWA section  502(7) broadened 
it somewhat .416
P. Section  307(a):  Toxic Pollutants
/T_he 1972 CWA attempted to deal with toxic pollutants 
reaching the nation’s water . Section  101(a)(3) bluntly requires 
that the “discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts be 
prohibited .”417 /T_his policy declaration was promulgated in 
S. 2770 and was unchanged as the bill worked its way into 
/f_inal legislation .418 S e c t i o n  307(a) of the Act required the 
EPA Administrator to publish a list of all toxic pollutants for 
which an e ﬄuent standard would be established . /T_he CWA 
expressly stated that the standard for toxic pollutants “may 
include a prohibition of the discharge of such pollutants or 
combination of such pollutants .”419 /T_he CWA directs the 
Administrator, after the list of toxic pollutants is compiled, 
to “publish a proposed e ﬄuent standard (or a prohibition)” 
for each toxic pollutant on the list, which “shall take into 
account the toxicity of the pollutant, its persistence, degrad -
ability, the usual or potential presence of the a ﬀected organ -

such organisms .”420 All e ﬄuent standards promulgated under 
this process were required to “provide[] an ample margin of 
safety .”421 Again, section  307(a) was included in the original 
version of S . 2770 and became part of the /f_inal legislation 
without major changes .422
Congress’s attempt to initiate close regulation of toxic 
chemicals reaching the nation’s waters did not fare nearly 
as well as the regulation of conventional pollutants under 
NPDES permits . Initially, EPA promulgated standards for 
only six toxic pollutants, but Congress eventually incorpo -
rated a consent decree, which required EPA to adopt e ﬄuent 
standards for sixty- /f_ive other toxics for twenty-one industries, 
into the 1987 amendments to the CWA .423
Q. Section  404: Joint EPA/Corps  Responsibility  for 
Dredge  and Fill Permits
President Nixon sought to calm the chaos that resulted from 
the Supreme Court’s revitalization of the Refuse Act permit 
requirement through a 1971 Executive Order424 that assigned 
EPA the responsibility for issuing the needed permits . As 
noted above, litigation over the possible application of NEPA 
stopped this initiative in its tracks after only a handful of 
permits had been issued, and Congress stepped in to deal 
with the issues through the adoption of the 1972 CWA . By 
expanding the de /f_inition of “navigable waters,”425 the 1972 
CWA not only created the broadest possible NPDES pro -
gram, but it also greatly enlarged the jurisdiction of the fed -
eral government to regulate dredging and /f_illing projects in 
wetlands that might negatively a ﬀect the quality of contigu -
ous surface waters . I n  s e c ti o n  404 of the CWA, Congress 
assigned responsibility to issue dredge and /f_ill permits to the 
Corps,426 but provided for close oversight by EPA to protect 
water quality .427 /T_his is one provision that was changed from 
the original provision in S . 2770, which gave all permit -
ting authority to EPA, but required consultation with the 
Corps when issues of navigation were present . /T_he House 
altered this arrangement and then the conference commit -
tee reversed the grant of initial authority—giving the Corps 
permit authority over dredge and /f_ill activities a ﬀecting navi -
gable waters, as broadly de /f_ined in the 1972 CWA, subject to 
consultation with EPA .428

R. Sections  309 and 509(a):  Federal  Enforcement  
Powers
/T_he power of the federal agency to bring enforcement actions 
against polluters was deliberately kept weak in all the fed -
eral legislation prior to the 1972 CWA .429 Before the 1972 
Act, federal enforcement revolved around a complex and 
convoluted “conference” mechanism and required the con -
sent of the a ﬀected state in order to proceed .430 /T_he 1972 
Act converted this very limited enforcement power into a 
much more streamlined and e ﬀective battery of admin -
istrative compliance orders, criminal /f_ines, civil actions, 
and authority to seek judicial abatement through injunc -
tive relief .431 /T_he CWA eliminated the former requirement 
of state consent before a federal enforcement process could 
start, and replaced it with a requirement that EPA provide a 
notice to state o ﬃcials thirty days prior to commencement 
of an enforcement action .432 Section  509(a) of the 1972 Act 
also granted EPA the authority to seek subpoenas from the 
U.S. District Courts to compel attendance and testimony of 
witnesses and the production of relevant books, papers, and 
documents .433 Senate bill S . 2770 /f_irst proposed substantially 
upgrading the federal enforcement powers, and neither the 
House nor the conference committee reduced or otherwise 
changed these new powers in signi /f_icant ways .434
S. Section  505: Citizen  Suits
Prior to the 1972 CWA, the Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act made no provision for citizen suits to enforce the federal 
law. /T_he brief /f_lurry of qui tam  suits under the Refuse Act in 
the early 1970s, however, demonstrated how e ﬀective citi -
zen actions could be used to reinforce environmental regula -
tory measures .435 Given the consistency of membership on 
the Senate and House Public Works Committees in the early 
1970s, it is not surprising that the citizen suit provision in 
section  505 of the CWA was based on the similar, but less 
well developed, citizen suit provision in the 1970 CAA .436 
Also relevant was the 1972 U .S. Supreme Court decision in 
Sierra Club v . Morton,437 which recognized citizens’ stand -
ing to challenge implementation of environmental protection 
laws. /T_he Sierra Club case was speci /f_ically cited in Congres -
sional exchanges about the language in the de /f_inition of “citi -
zen” and the scope of the citizen suit provision in hearings 
on the conference report on the bill that became the 1972 
CWA .438

In order to expedite implementation of the 1972 Act, which 
was anticipated to attract multiple legal challenges, Congress 
sought to streamline the judicial review process . /T_he act 
assigned exclusive jurisdiction to the federal circuit in which 
the issue arose to review challenges to EPA’s promulgation 
of eﬄuent or performance standards, issuance of a permit, 
or determination as to the adequacy of a state permit pro -
gram . /T_his step again was based on similar judicial review 
provisions in the 1970 CAA .439 Litigation relating to EPA’s 
enforcement authority, on the other hand, whether seeking 
civil or criminal remedies, was left with the federal district 
courts .440 /T_he substantial changes in the jurisdiction for fed -
eral courts to review EPA actions originated in S . 2770 and 
moved through the legislative process virtually unchanged .441
VII. Conclusion
/T_he CWA of 1972 established, by far, the loftiest goals ever 
adopted in the United States for protecting and enhancing 
an environmental resource . Given today’s gridlock in Wash -
ington D .C., it is amazing to contemplate that, by wide mar -
gins, Congress once collectively resolved to improve all the 
nation’s waterways to the “ /f_ishable and swimmable” level of 
quality by 1983, and further committed to the total elimi -
nation of all discharges of pollutants to the nation’s waters 
by 1985 . Like many other broad legislative solutions to com -
plex national problems, many unanticipated issues arose in 
its implementation that engendered a good deal of litiga -
tion—much of it by regulated parties challenging EPA’s 
interpretation of its authority, but some of it by environmen -
tal groups pushing EPA to carry out actions mandated by 
the CWA . It may be some measure of the CWA’s quality as 
a piece of environmental legislation that Congress has seen 
/f_it to amend it in a substantial way only twice—in 1977442 
and again in 1987 .443 More importantly, the core of the 
carefully balanced regulatory regime it sought to create for 
protecting and improving the quality of the nation’s waters 
has remained virtually unchanged for forty years, except for 
some lessening of the stringency of the e ﬄuent limitations and 
repeated relaxations in the timetables to be attained .
An amazing forty years of federal and state activity 
have unfolded since the CWA became law . Yet, thinking 
back to what was happening in the decade leading up to 
the 1972 CWA, many of the current water quality issues 
have a familiar ring to them . T en examples of these lin -
gering issues are: (1)  maintaining and upgrading ambient 
water quality standards; (2)  calibrating e ﬄuent limitations 
to protect and enhance the achievement of water quality 
standards for receiving waters; (3)  keeping technology-

strategies; (9)  balancing legitimate state concerns with 
federal interests in enforcement actions against polluters; 
and (10)  /f_inding adequate funding in a tight economy to 
make the infrastructure investments necessary to elimi -
nate the most troubling pollution problems . /T_hese themes 
may have changed in scope, focus, and vocabulary, but at 
their core they are the same issues we faced forty years ago 
at the inception of the 1972 CWA .
Taking stock of the 1972 CWA’s fortieth anniversary, the 
nation has not come close to attaining the “No Discharge” 
goal, only about half of the nation’s waters are /f_ishable and 
swimmable, and way too many toxic chemicals are still /f_inding 
their way into our waterways . To idealists, this is disappoint -
ing, but to realists it is not at all surprising . Achieving heroic water pollution control gains in a country as geographically 
diverse and economically active as the United States is truly 
diﬃcult work, and requires great patience and perseverance .
So, should we celebrate or mourn the still problematic qual -
ity of many of our waters? One way to think about this ques -
tion is to ask: what would have happened in the absence of 
the establishment of these highly ambitious goals and the sea 
change in regulatory philosophy initiated by the 1972 CWA? 
One can only speculate, but my best guess is that without the 
philosophical commitment to the proposition that no one 
has the right to use public waters to dispose of their wastes, 
enforced by progressively stricter e ﬄuent standards, our waters 
would be less clean today . It is very doubtful we would be as far 
along toward the zero-discharge goal as we are today if we had 
relied solely on receiving water quality standards to cleanse the 
nation’s waters . Although the 1972 CWA has sparked much 
improvement in many waterways, it clearly has not lived up to 
its own lofty aspirations over the past forty years . It will prob -
ably never do so until the commitment to high quality water 
resources nationwide regains the strong level of public support 
it enjoyed during the unique decade of environmental reform 
leading up to adoption of the 1972 Act .
