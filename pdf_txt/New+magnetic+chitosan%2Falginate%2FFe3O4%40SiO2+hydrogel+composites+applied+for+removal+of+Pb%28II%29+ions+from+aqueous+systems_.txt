Abstract 
Chitosan/alginate (CHT/ALG) and magnetic CHT/ALG/Fe 3O4@SiO 2 composites were 
successfully prepared and used as adsorbent materia ls to remove Pb(II) from aqueous 
systems. New hydrogel beads were yielded through an  unpublished methodology,  examining 
the ionic strength of the chitosan (CHT) solutions.  Polyvalent cations and toxic cross-linking 
agents such as glutaraldehyde and epichlorohydrin, frequently used to prepare CHT/ALG-
based materials were not used in this study. The sa mples were characterized by scanning 
electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectr oscopy, transmission electron 
microscopy, thermal analysis (TAG/DSC), and zeta po tential measurements. The addition of 
Fe3O4@SiO 2 (7.9±3.4 nm) significantly modified the surface mo rphology of the composites. 
The CHT/ALG/Fe 3O4@SiO 2(8) hydrogel comprising the highest Fe 3O4@SiO 2 content (8.0 
wt.%), displayed magnetic feature and zeta potentia l of -76.8 mV at pH 6.0. Kinetic and 
equilibrium adsorption studies reveal that Elovich and Redlich-Peterson mathematical models 
provide the best fits for the experimental data, re spectively.  The magnetic composite 
CHT/ALG/Fe 3O4@SiO 2(8) had maximum adsorption capacity (q m) of 234.77 mg g-1 and 
adsorption/desorption cycles designed its reuse per formance. The CHT/ALG/Fe 3O4@SiO 2(8) 
hydrogel was applied to treat battery effluent, ach ieving 99.04% Pb(II) removal, and Download English Version:
