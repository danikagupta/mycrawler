The isolation and screening of antimicrobial activity of 3 actinomycete strains isolated from soil s amples 
collected in Chaiyaphum, Nan and Phatthalung provinces, Thailand were carried out. Strains S39 -7, KC19 -1 and 
K57-1 were belonged to the genus Amycolatopsis  based on their phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics. 
On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain S39 -7 was closely related to Amycolatopsis albidoflavus  
KCTC  9471T (99.2%).  Strains KC19 -1 and K57 -1 were closely related to A. kentuckyensis  NRRL B -24129T 
with 99.3 and 99.2% similarity, respectively. All of them contained meso -diaminopimelic acid (DAP) in cell wall 
peptidoglycan and had MK -9 (H 4) as a major menaquinones. The DNA G+C contents of the strains ranged from 
67.2 to 73.4 mol%.   On secondary screening of antimicrobial activity, the ethyl acetate extract of the 
fermentation products of strain S39 -7 was active against Staphylococcus aureus  ATCC 6538, Bacillus subtilis  
ATCC 6633, Escherichia coli  ATCC 25922, Kocuria r hizophila  ATCC 9341, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
ATCC 27853 while strain KC 19 -1 was active against only S. aureus  ATCC 6538. Strain K 57 -1 was active 
against E. coli  ATCC 25922 and K. rhizophila  ATCC 9341. In addition strain  S39 -7 could inhibit against 
methicillin resistant (MRSA)  S. aureus  266.

INTRODUCTION  
 
The genus Amycolatopsis was established by 
Lechevalier et al ., (1986) and was assigned to family  
Pseudonocardiaceae  (Embley et al ., 1988; Cross, 1994; 
Warwick et al ., 1994). Recently, increasing interest has been 
shown in Amycolatopsis strains because they are a very important 
genus in the antibiotics industry. They produce some of the most 
widely used antibiotics such  as rifamycin that produced from A. 
mediterranei (Meja et al ., 1997) and vancomycin from A. 
orientalis (Pittenger and Brigham, 1956). In addition, 
vancoresmycin was produced from A. vancoremycina  (Hopmann 
et al.,  2002) , balhimycin from  A. balhimycina , toly pomycin from 
A. tolypomycina  and  nogabecin from  A. keratiniphila  (Wink  et 
al., 2003), and  decaplanin from A. decaplanina (Wink  et al ., 
2004).  Among them, rifamycim is one of the major drugs for 
clinical treatment of HIV -relate d tuberculosis, and vancomycin is 
currently considered as the  last line of  those d efense against          
.       .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 some microorganisms that are resistant to β- lactam antibiotics 
(Yao et al ., 2002). In the course of our investigation of 
actinomycete isolates from soils  in Thailand, the isolation and 
screening of antimicrobial activity and identification of strains were 
determined based on the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic 
characteristics in cluding 16S rRNA gene sequence  analysis.  
 
MATERI ALS AND METHODS  
 
Isolation and Characterization of the isolates  
Three actinomycete strains were isolated from soil 
samples collected from  Chaiyaphum, Nan and  Phatthalung  
provinces, Thailand (Table 1) using starch -casein nitrate agar 
(Thawai et al ., 2004). The phenotypic characteristics were 
determined by the methods described by Shirling and Gottlieb 
(1966) and Arai et al. (1976).    
Scanning e lectron microscope was used for determining 
the morphology of strains grew on YMA  (ISP medium no. 2, Yeas t 
extract - Malt extract agar). Cell wall diaminopimelic acid (DAP) 
isomers were determined as described by Kutzner (1981). 
Menaquinone  system was analysed as described by  Komagata and 
Suzuki (1987).

16S rDNA sequenc e and phylogenetic analyses  
DNA of the strains was isolated from cells grown in 
Yeast extract -Malt extract broth (YMB) with 0.2% of glycine 
reported by Yamada and Komagata (1970) and purified as 
described by Saito and Miura (1963).   DNA base composition 
analysis was analysed by the  method of  Tamaoka and Komagata 
(1984).   The complete 16S rRNA  gene was amplified by PCR 
using  primers, 8 -27f  and 1492r.   
The amplified 16S rRNA gene was used as templates for 
sequencing with Big Dye Terminator sequencing Kit (Perkin 
Elmer) and analy zed by AB1377 automated DNA sequencer 
(Perkin Elmer). The sequencing reaction for each sample was 
performed in DNA Thermal Cycler (Gene Amp PCR System 
2400; Perkin Elmer) by using  primers, 8 -27f (5’ -
AGAGTTTGATC (A/C)TGGCTCAG -3’), 530f (5’ -
GTGCCAGC(A/C)GCC GCGG -3’) and 1114f  (5’ -
GCAACGAGCGCAACCC -3’).  Homology search was performed 
using the standard BLAST sequence similarity searching program 
version 2.2.1 from the web server. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  
BLAST/  against previously reported sequence  at the GenBank/  
EMBL/DDBJ database. The sequence was multiply aligned with 
selected sequences obtained from Gen Bank/EMBL/DDBJ by 
using the CLUSTAL_X (Thompson et al., 1997).  
The alignment was manually verified and adjusted prior 
to the construction of phylogenet ic tree. The phylogenetic tree was 
constructed by using neighbor -joining (Saitou and Nei, 1987)    in 
the MEGA program version 2.1 ( Kumar et al ., 2001). The 
confidence values of branches of the phylogenetic tree were 
determined using the bootstrap analyses based on 1000 
resamplings (Felsenstien, 1985).  16S rDNA  sequence of 
Micromonospora chalcea  JCM 3082T was used as an out group. 
The values for sequences similarity among the closest strains were 
calculated manually after pairwise alignments obtained using the 
CLUSTAL_X program (Thompson et al ., 1997).                               
Gaps and ambiguous nucleotides were eliminated from 
calculations.   
 
Antimicrobial activity  of strains  
Primary screening of antimicrobial activities was 
performed on YMA plates (Anansiriwattana et al. (2006) against 
S. aureus  ATCC 6538, B. subtilis  ATCC 6633, E. coli  ATCC 
25922, P.  aeruginosa  ATCC 27853, Kocuria rhizophila   ATCC 
9341 and C. albicans  ATCC 10231. All tested microorganisms 
were cultivated on Mueller -Hinton agar slants at 37C for 24 h, 
except for the yeast strain that was cultivated on Sabouraud’s 
dextrose agar slant at 30C for 24 h.  Secondary screening of the 
strains was examined by cultiva ting each  strains  into a 500 -ml 
Erlenmeyer flask containing 250 ml of YM broth and incubated on 
a rotary shaker at 200 rpm, 30๐C for 11 days. The culture broth 
was extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and concentrated under 
reduced pressure to yield the crude extract. The ethyl acetate 
extract s were tested by agar disc diffusion method (Lorian, 1991).   
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
Isolation and characterization of isolates  
Three soil samples were collected from Chaiyaphum, 
Nan and  Phatthalung  provinces, Thailand.   Actinomycetes were 
isolated and cultivated on YMA and kept in cold room at 4 C.  
Sources of samples, pH and strain number were shown in Table 1.   
The strains S39 -7, KC19 -1 and K57 -1 produced 
branched, fragmenting aerial and substrate mycelium with pink 
white, brownish white and yellowish white colonial color on YMA 
plates, respectively. They produced hyphae, spores borne in chains 
that are  resemble  to  Streptomyces  (Goodfellow et al.,  1988; 
Cross, 1994) (Figure 1). The cultural characteristics of strains on 
YMA,  tyrosine agar, oatmeal agar, glycerol -asparagine agar and 
inorganic salt -starch agar are shown in Table 2.  
Strains S39 -7, KC19 -1 and K57 -1 grew on YMA with 
2% and 4% NaCl, at pH 7.0, 9.0 and 10 and at 28 C, whereas only 
strain S39 -7 could grow on 6% NaCl. They grew  at pH and 
temperature within the range as reported previously (Cross, 1994). 
All strains could not form melanin. The physiologi cal and 
biochemical characteristics of strains S39 -7, KC19 -1 and K57 -1  
were shown in Table 3.   
All strains hydrolysed esculin, produced acid from 
adonitol, cellobiose, dextrin, meso -erythriol, fructose, glucose, D -
galactose, meso -inositol, lactose, malto se, D -mannitol, melezitose, 
melibiose, methyl D -glucoside, raffinose, sucrose, trehalose and 
xylose; and utilized fructose, glucose, glycerol, D -mannitol, 
raffinose, rhamnose and xylose.  Variable characteristics of strains 
were found in gelatin and starch   hydrolysis, growth at pH 5, 
growth on 6% NaCl,  acid production from L - arabinose, 
rhamnose, salicin and sorbitol; utilization of L - arabinose and 
melibiose (Table 3).   
Strains KC19 -1 and K57 -1 grew on YMA                      
containing 50 µg/ml and 10 0µg/ml of novobiocin whereas                 
strain S39 -7 did not gr ow on YMA containing 50 µg/ml                     
and 100µg/ml of novobiocin comparison to A. keratinophila  
KCTC 19104Tand A. albidoflavus KCTC 9471T that were                
sensitive to  novobiocin 100 µg/ml (data not shown).  However, 
other Amycolatopsis  species such as A. eurytherma  DSM                 
44348T, A. palatopharyngis  1BDZ T and A. rubida  JCM 10871 T 
were resistant to only on novobiocin 5 µg/ml (Huang et al., 2001; 
2004; Kim  et al ., 2002).  Therefore, the use of novobiocin                      
in the medium for the screening of Amycolatopsis  strains                 
should be considered (Tajima et al.,  2001; Takahashi and Omura, 
2003).  
 On the basis of cell wall peptidoglycan,  the strains                
S39-7, KC19 -1 and K57 -1  contained meso -diaminopimelic                
acid which was the same pattern as the genus Amycolatopsis .            
The predominant menaquinone was MK -9 (H 4) and                                        
the small amounts of MK -9 (H 2), MK -9 (H 6), and MK -9                   
(H8) were found. Their DNA G+C content ranged from                      
67.2-73.4 mol% as reported by Lechevalier et al. (1986) (Table 3).

16S rRNA gene sequence and phylogenetic analyses     
Phylogenetic analysis of strains S39 -7, KC19 -1 and K57 -
1 revealed that they were belonged to the genus Amycolatopsis  
(Fig. 2). The percentage of  16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of  
Amycolatopsis  strains to another strains were showed in Table 1.  
Strain S 39-7 was closely related to A. albidoflavus KCTC 9471T 
(Lee and Hah, 2001). The two organisms shared 16S rDNA 
similarity value of 99.2%.  The strains KC19 -1 and K57 -1 were 
99.3% related to each other and showed 99.3 % and                            
99.2% si milarility with A. kentuckyensis  NRRL B -24129T (Labeda   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
et  al., 2003), respectively.  Strain S39 -7 could produce dark red 
soluble pigment and produced acid from raffinose but no growth at 
10 ° C. These characteristics could differentiate it from A. 
albidoflavus KCTC 9471T (Lee and Hah, 2001).   Strain KC19 -1 
could produce acid from raffino se but not decompose gelatin while 
K57-1 could produce acid from raffinose but not from L -arabinose 
and did not liquefy gelatin that differentiated  them from A. 
kentuchyensis NRRL B -14129T (Labeda et  al., 2003). DNA -DNA 
hybridization experiment is acknowledged as the superior method 
for the elucidation of relationships between closely related taxa,

such as known strains and species, in which a DNA homology 
value of about >70% plays a dominant role (Wayne  et al., 1987). 
For further study,  Amycolatopsis  strains S39 -7, KC19 -1 and K57 -1  
should be hybridized with closely related type strains for proposed 
that they are possible new species.  
 
Antimicrobial activity of strains  
Strain S39 -7 exhibited antimicrobi al activity against S. 
aureus  ATCC 6538, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, E. coli  ATCC 25922, 
K. rhizophila   ATCC 9341 and P. aeruginosa  ATCC 27853 while  
 
 
 
 
 Strain KC 19 -1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against  only S.

activity against E. coli  ATCC 25922 and K. rhizophila  ATCC 
9341. All strains did not showed activitiy against C. albicans  
ATCC 10231 (Table 4).   
In addition strain  S39 -7 could inhibit  against methicillin 
resistant S. aureus  (MRSA) 266.  The study of antimicrobial 
substances from Amycolatopsis  strains was interesting to  further 
studies on the fermentation, extraction, purification, and structure 
elucidation.
