ABSTRACT  
Dye is utilized to impart colour to materials of which it becomes an imperative role in human life. The 
physical and chemical methods of industrial effluent treatment do not take away the dyes successfully. Recent 
promising in vestigates on biological decolourisation of textile effluent has showed that variety of microorganisms 
and plants accomplished of decolorizing wide range of anionic and cationic dyes. A variety of biological treatment 
methods are set up to be the top for d ecolourisation of dye. Biological decolourisation of dye effluent is receiving 
much consideration due to cost effective and less regeneration by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae, 
and plants Current status of biological decolourisation and reme diation of dye effluents, and deals with the most 
deliberate part on the effects of various parameters like pH, temperature and dye concentrations is briefly discussed 
in this article.  
Keywords: Decolourisation, bacteria, algae, fungi.  
INTRODUCTION  
Colour is a observable pollutant. Colour in effluent has now been considered a pollutant that needs to be treated 
before discharging it. Industries have shown a significant increase in the use of synthetic complex organic dyes as 
the colouring material. The globa l consumption of textiles is currently around 30 million tones with expected 
growth at 3% per annum. The coloration of this total needs approximately 8 x 105 tons of dyes (Walker G M  et. 
al.,1997)  and it is estimated that 10,000 different types of dyes an d pigments are produced worldwide annually. 
Out of which a large number of dyes are azo compounds ( -N=N -), which are linked by an azo bridge and are used 
by a wide number of industries ( BizunehAdinew, 2012)  
Most industries use dyes and pigments to colour t heir products, which include textile, tannery, food, paper 
and pulp, printing, carpet and mineral processing industries (Asamudo N.U et.al.,2005 ).The effluents of these 
industries are highly coloured and the disposal of these wastes into receiving waters ca uses damage to the 
environment  (Mubarak Ali D. A. et. al., 2011 ). They may significantly affect photosynthetic activity in aquatic life 
due to reduce light penetration and may also be toxic to some aquatic life because of the presence of metals, 
chlorides,  etc. Synthetic textile dyes used each year are lost during manufacture and processing operation and 20% 
of these dyes enter the environment through effluents that result from the treatment of residual industrial 
waters (BizunehAdinew, 2012). Colour removal  has been the target of great attention in the last few years, not only 
because of the toxicity of dyes but also due to its visibility.  
 Various chemical and physical processes, such as ozonation, photo oxidation, electro coagulation, 
adsorption, activated  carbon, membrane filtration and flocculation are applied for colour removal from textile. Such 
methods are often very costly and although the dyes are removed, accumulation of concentrated sludge creates a 
disposal problem  (Bumpus,J.A., 2004 ). Due to the financial constraints posed on the treatment of pollutants, they 
are discarded into the environment and it contributes to about 40% of the total industrial wastewater. There is a 
need to find alternative biodegradations that are effective in removing dyes from large volumes of effluents and are 
low in cost such as biological or combination systems.Biological methods are generally considered environment 
friendly as they can lead tocomplete mineralization of organic pollutants at low cost. Biodegradation is a  promising 
approach for the remediation of synthetic dyes wastewater because of its cost effectiveness, efficiency, and 
environment friendly nature. It is now known that several microorganisms, including fungi, bacteria, yeasts, and 
algae, can completely d ecolorize many dyes( Tripathi A. et. al., 2011 ).The present work discuss about biological 
decolourisation of dyes by algae ,bacteria and fungi. And several factors play important roles in dye decolourisation 
by algae, bacteria and fungi. Among these factors , pH, dye concentrations, and biomass concentrations of 
biomaterials are quite important  ISSN: 0974 -2115

adsorption, flocculation, flotation, electrochemical destruct ion, and mineralization and decolourisation process have 
some disadvantages such as cost, time, and release of residues  (BizunehAdinew, 2012 ). All these techniques are 
minimizing the toxicity level not to neutralize the toxicity (Stolz  A, 2001 ). To alterna te these techniques, 
microorganism can be used to completely degrade the dyes, because microorganisms reduce the dyes by secreting 
enzymes such as laccase, azo reductase, peroxidase, and hydrogenase (Sudha M  et. al.,2014) . Biological dye 
elimination  is main ly based on microbial biotransformation of  dyes. The compact  forms of  dyes are further 
mineralized into simpler compounds and are utilized as their energy source .Based on the available literature, the 
microbial decolourisation of azo dyes is more effect ive under combined aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A wide 
range of microorganisms are capable of degrading a variety of azo dyes including bacteria, fungi and yeast. They 
have developed enzyme systems for the decolourisation and mineralization of azo dye s under certain environmental 
conditions. Decolourisation of dyes may take place in two ways: either adsorption on the microbial biomass 
(biosorption) or biodegradation of the dyes by the cells  (BizunehAdinew, 2012 ).  
Bacterial decolourisation : The bacteri al reduction of the dye is usually nonspecific and bacterial decolo urisation 
is normally fasterm(McMullan G et. al., 2001 ). A wide range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as 
Pseudomonas putida( Tripathi A. et. al., 2011 ), Bacillus sp.(  Abraham C.I et. al.,2014 ), Pseudomonousputida( Wei 
Wang  et. al., 2012 ) Bcillussubtil is(Milikli G  et. al., 2012 ), Pseudomonas spp.(  Shah MP  et. al., 2013 ), Bacillus 
subtilis SPR42(Baljeet Singh Saharan  et. al., 2011 ), Tsukamurella sp. J8025(Wen -Tung Wu   et. al., 2012 ), 
Geoba cillusstearothermophilus UCP 986( Norma S.  et. al., 2010 ), P. fluorescens and Corynebac  (Saleh M Al - Garni  
et. al., 2013 ), Georgenia sp. CC -NMPT -T3(MadhuriSahasrabudhe et. al., 2013 ), Bacillus cereus( Vidhyakalarani R et. 
al., 2013)  have been extensively repo rted as degraders of dyes . bacterial decolourisation is effective   to decolorize 
both azo and anthraquinone dyes. And it will result in the production of biogas. But sometimes it will result o nly 
low decolourisation rates.(  Bumpus,J.A., 2004 ) 
For the effe ctive decolourisation of dye it requires specific oxygen catalyzed enzymes and requires 
additional carbon and energy sources ( Tony Hadibarata  et. al., 2013 ). Some strains of aerobic use azo dyes as sole 
source of carbon and nitrogen : others only reduce th e azo group by special oxygen -tolerant azo reductases.A 
number of research groups investigated the ability of bacteria in metabolism of azo dyes. Azo dyes are not readily 
metabolized under aerobic condition, and as a result of metabolic pathways it degrade d into intermediate 
compounds but not mineralized. It can be completely degraded under coupled aerobic -anaerobic degradation 
(Sudha M  et. al.,2014 ). In anaerobic condition, the azo bond undergoes cleavage to generate aromatic amines and it 
was mineralized by nonspecific enzymes through ring cleavage under aerobic condition. Therefore, coupled 
anaerobic treatment followed by aerobic treatment can be an efficient degradation method of azo dyes (Feigel B J 
et. al., 1993,  Mubarak Ali D. A  et. al., 2011 )  have d escribed bacterial strains which display a good growth in 
aerobic or agitation culture, but color removal was obtained with a high efficiency in anoxic or anaerobic culture. 
Mixed bacterial culture can give a better degradation rate than the individual strain (Walker G M et. al., 1997 ). 
Fungal decolouri sation : The most widely explored fungi in consider to dye degradation are the ligninolytic 
fungi(Bumpus, 2004).. Apart from this, Schizophyllumommune IBL-062(Muhammad Asgher et. al., 2013 ), 
Aspergillusallhabadii(30),A. nige r(30), A. sulphurous( Namdhari B S et. al., 2012 ), P. eryngii F032( Tony 
Hadibarata et. al., 2013 ), White -rot fungi( pleurotusflorida)  (Krishnaveni M, 2011 ) have been report which are 
competent of decolourisation of dyes. Large literature exists regarding the potential of these fungi is to ox idize 
phenolic, nonphenolic, soluble and nonsoluble dyes  (Padmanaban V C  et. al., 2013 ).White -rot fungi produces 
lignin peroxidase, manganeseperoxidase and laccase that degrades many aromatic compounds due to th eir 
nonspecific enzyme systems( Toh, Y C et. a l., 2013 ).  
Steady operation of unremitting fungal bioreactors for the treatment of synthetic dye solutions have been 
achieved, application of white -rot fungi for the removal of dyes from textile wastewaters faces many problems such 
as large volumes produc ed, the nature of synthetic dyes, and control of biomass (Stolz  A, 2001 ). In the previous 
type, the cells create enzymes such as laccase, Manganese peroxidase and lignin perox idase to mineralize the dyes 
(Reghukumar C  et. Al., 1996, Fu Y et. al.,2001 ). Lignin peroxidase act a key role in the degradation of azo dyes 
using P. chrysosporium (Ollikka P et. al.,1993 ).

Algal decolourization : Algae have been found to be potential biosorbents because of their availability in both 
fresh and saltwater (Wen -Tung Wu et. al., 2012 ). The biosorption capacity of algae is attributed to th eir relatively 
high surface area and high binding affinity. Cell wall properties of algae play a major role in biosorption; 
electrostatic attraction and complexation are known to take place during algal biosorption. Functional groups such ISSN: 0974 -2115

sequestration of contaminants from wastewater  (Asha Srinivasan , 2010 ).  
Colour removal by algae was due to three intrinsically different mechanisms of assimilative 
utilizationofchromophores for production of algal biomass, CO2 and H2O transformation of coloured molecules to 
non-coloured molecules, and adsorption of chromophores on alga l biomass.  Report of algae capable of degrading 
azo dyes, through an induced form of an azo reductase showed good colour removal (Anjaneyulu , 2005 ). Several 
species of Chlorella and oscillotoria were capable of degrading azo dyes to their aromatic amines and in further 
metabolizing the aromatic amines to simple or ganic compounds or CO2. Some were even capable of utilizing a few 
azo dyes as their sole s ource of carbon and nitrogen (Wen -Tung Wu , 2012 ).

Factors affecting biodegradation of dyes: Ecosystems are active environments with variable abiotic conditions, 
like pH, temperature, presence of oxy gen, metals, salts, etc. Optimization of such abiotic conditions will greatly 
help in the development of industrial -scale bioreactors for bioremediation.  
1. pH: In general, fungi show better decolourisation and biodegradation activities at acidic or neural  pH whereas 
bacteria at neutral or basic pH. The pH plays a major upshot on the efficiency of dye decolourisation, and the 
optimal pH for colour removal was 6 -10. (Palanivelan Ramachandran et. al., 2013 ) Adaptation of microorganisms 
to varying pH enhances the process of effluent treatment. The optimum pH for color removal was neutral to 
slightly alkaline and the colour removal was decreased rapidly at strongly acid or alkaline pH values. Almost all 
fungal dye decolourisation studies showed that higher dye r emoval rate take place in acidic pH range. Altering the 
pH within a range of 7 -9.5 have a very little effect on dye reduction process ( Palanivelan Ramachandran et. al., 
2013 ). 
2. Temperature : Temperature is an important environmental factor and the biodegr adation activities of 
microorganisms are affected by changes in temperature. The rate of colour removal increases with increasing initial 
temperature ( Palanivelan Ramachandran et. al., 2013) . The ambient temperature for colour removal for bacteria 
was 35 -450C. the degradation activities of the microorganisms decrease because of slow growth, decreased 
reproduction rate and deactivation of enzymes responsible for degradation ( BizunehAdinew, 2012 ).  
3. Initial dye concentration : The effect of dye concentration  strongly influences the rate of dye removal and also 
impacts the toxicity of dye molecule. Percentage of decolourisaton increased with increase in time irrespective of 
initial dye concentration for bacteria. The decolourisation of dye decreases with incre asing dye concentration. 
Growth of fungi was affected by the presence of high concentration of dye . (Kapdan I K et. al., 2002 ) reported the 
maximum dye stuff turquoise blue G, phthalocyanin dye) concentration tolerated by C.versicolor was 1200mg/l. 
Decolour iation efficiency was high if dyestuff concentrations were 100 -250mg/l (in 3 -5 days) and nearly 700 -ISSN: 0974 -2115

July -September 2014                                           297                                                                JCPS Volume 7 Issue 4  1200mg/l (9 days). It indicates decolorization of dye decreases with increasing dye concentration. (Parshetti G et. 
al., 20 07) 
4. Effect of Nutrients : Nutri ents plays an significant role in dye decolourisation process, superior amount of 
nutrients significantly influences the growth of micro -organism  and boost the degradation of dyes in aqueous 
solution. Pseudomonas sp. BSP -4 isolated from azo dye contaminate d soil capable to decolourise azo dye black E 
by utilizing it as nitrogen source up to 300 ppm in 36 hours (Sudhakar P et. al., 2002 ) Nutrient constituent in the 
medium have noticeable effect on colour removal along with natural supplements had a positive impact on dye 
decolourisation for fungi Aspergillusfumigatus XC6 supplemented with the a range of carbon and nitrogen sources 
particularly ammonium sulphate had significant effect on effluent  colou r reduction (Jinqi L et. al., 1992) . 
CONCLUSION  
Economical r emoval of colour from effluents remains an important problem although a number of 
successful systems have evolved employing various physico -chemical and biological processes. These effluents 
mostly comprises of chemical or synthetic compounds which can sev erely affect the biotic life of the environment 
and cause several health hazards to mankind indirectly. Biodegradation of synthetic dyes using various fungi, 
bacteria and algae is becoming a potential approach for the treatment of dye wastewaters. With the  increasing 
production of synthetic chemicals and their ultimate release into the environment, the natural microbial populations 
are unable to decompose them in due course of time.  
To develop a low cost and low -technological bioprocess for the treatment o f dye waste waters. Industries to 
be treat their wastewaters before discharging into the environment. The application of microbes is simple and can 
be readily modified according to the character of the dye. An understanding and knowledge of biodegradation are 
helpful in pollution abatement and the production of bio friendly and environment friendly products like biodiesel, 
bioethanol, bio pesticides, biopolymers, etc. The biodegradation abilities of microorganisms can be enhanced by 
gradually exposing them to higher concentrations of synthetic organic chemicals. Microorganisms exposed to 
higher levels of pollutants evolve mechanisms and pathways for degrading  them.
