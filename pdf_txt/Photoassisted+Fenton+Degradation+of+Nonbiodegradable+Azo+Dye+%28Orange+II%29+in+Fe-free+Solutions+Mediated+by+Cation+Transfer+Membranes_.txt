ABSTRACT 
The degradation of an azo dye orange G (OG)  in aqueous solution by Fenton oxidation process 
has been investigated. The effects of different reaction p arameters such as initial pH, the initial hydrogen 
peroxide concentration ([H 2O2]o), the initial ferrous concentration ([Fe 2+ ]o) on dye decolouriz ation are 
demonstrated in detail. The optimum pH for both; Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions in this study are 
about pH 3.0. The decolourization rate of OG distinctly incr eases with the increasing amount of Fe 2+ . 
The optimal levels of H 2O2 required for the process are also examined. High levels  of H 2O2 appear to 
reduce dye decolourization. The experimental results showed  that the photo- Fenton process was an 
effective process for the degradation of OG.  
Key words: AOPs, Azo dye, Orange G, Decolourization, Photo-Fenton, F enton. 
INTRODUCTION 
Azo dyes, aromatic moieties linked together by azo (-N=N-) chromophores, 
represent the largest class of dyes used in textile -processing and other industries. The 
release of these compounds into the envi ronment is undesirable, not only because of their 
colour, but also because many azo dyes and their br eakdown products are toxic and/or 
mutagenic to life.  It has been estimated that colo rant release to the environment without 
proper treatment represents 15  % of total world production or 150 tons per day 1. These 
commercial dyes are also resistant to light degrada tion, the action of atmospheric gases,

acids and bases. The same properties make these dye  stuffs difficult to degrade or 
decolorize. 
Various physical, chemical and biological pre- treatment, main treatment and post 
treatment techniques can be employed to remove colo ur from dye containing 
wastewaters 2−8. Physicochemical techniques include membrane filtr ation, coagulation /
flocculation, precipitation,  flotation, adsorption, ion exchange, ion pair extr action, 
ultrasonic mineralization, electrolysis, biological  techniques include bacterial and fungal 
biosorption and biodegradation in aerobic, anaerobi c, anoxic or combined 
anaerobic/aerobic treatment proc esses. advanced oxidation (chlorination, bleaching,  
ozonation, Fenton oxidation and photocatalytic oxid ation). Several factors determine the 
technical and economic feasibility of each single d ye removal technique: 
(i) Dye type 
(ii) Wastewater composition 
(iii) Dose and costs of required chemicals 
(iv) Operation costs (energy and material) 
(v) Environmental fate and handling costs of generated waste products 
Chemical oxidation is an attractive technique for t he purification of water 
contaminated with organic compounds, especially w ith those which are not susceptible to 
undergo biological degradation. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are mostly based 
on the generation of highly reactive radical specie s (especially the hydroxyl radical HO •) 
that can react with a wide range of compounds and a lso with compounds and  that are 
otherwise difficult to degrade, e.g. dye molecules.  There are several methods for 
generating hydroxyl radicals: Fenton (H 2O2/Fe 2+ ) and photo- Fenton (H 2O2/Fe 2+ /UV). A 
drawback for application of Fenton or photo- Fenton  oxidation for the treatment of the 
usually highly alkaline- textile-processing wastewa ters is that this  process requires low 
pH 2−5. At higher pH, large volumes of waste sludge are g enerated by the precipitat ion of 
ferric iron salts and the process loses effectivene ss as H 2O2 is catalytically decomposed to 
oxygen 9. Fenton or photo- Fenton oxidation will furthermore be negatively aff ected by the 
presence of radical scavengers and strong chelating  agents in the w astewater.  Malik and 
Saha 10  reported that the removal rate is strongly dependen t on the initial concentration of 
the dye, Fe 2+ and H 2O2. Muruganandham and Swaminathan 11  have carried out studies 
where similar results were obtained. They suggested  a pH of 3  is the optimum pH for 
Fenton and photo-Fenton processes.  Int. J. Chem. Sci.: 6(2), 2008   
 621  
The aim of the present work is to analyze the feasi bility of decolourization of OG 
by Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. The effects of pH, dosages of hydrogen peroxide 
and ferrous ions, which affect the efficiency of Fe nton and photo-Fenton reactions in 
reactive OG oxidation were also investigated 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Material 
The azo dye, OG was used without further purificati on. Molecular structure of OG 
in non-hydrolysed form is illustrated in Table 1. Iron (II) sulphate hexahydrate was 
provide d by Labosi puriss ( > 99 %). Aqueous solution conta ining 33 wt % of hydrogen 
peroxide (purity 99.9 %) was obtained from prolabo.  pH of the reaction solutions was 
adjusted using HCl and NaOH solutions. Bidistilled water was used throughout this study.

Experimental procedures 
All experiments have been carried out in a cylindri cal reactor in quartz (100 cm of 
length and 2 cm of internal diameter) surrounded sy mmetrically by three externals low-
pre ssure mercury lamps (germicides) emitting mainly at  254 nm. Ventilator located at the 
bottom of the enacting part assure the cooling of t he system. The entire system is placed in 
a cylindrical enclosure. A predetermined quantity o f FeSO 4 and H 2O2 was dripp ed into the 
reactor. Samples were taken from the reactor period ically using a pipette, and were 
immediately analyzed.  
Analytical methods 
The UV-vis spectra of dye were recorded from 200 to  800 nm using a UV- vis 
spectrophotometer (Unicam Heliosα) with a spectrome tric quartz cell (1 cm path length).  Chenini Halima et al.: Decolourization of Azo….

The maximum absorbance wavelength (λ max ) of OG is 476 nm. Therefore, the 
concentration of the dye in the reaction mixture at  different reaction times w ere determined 
by measuring the absorption intensity at λ max = 476 nm and a calibration curve. The 
photodegradation efficiency of OG was defined as fo llows:  
 Photodegradation efficiency (%) = (1- C t / C o) x 100 % 
Where the C o is the initial concentration of OG, and C t is the concentration of OG 
at reaction time t (min). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Absorption spectra of the dye solutions with the co ncentration of 50 mg/L is shown 
in Fig. 1.

The maximum absorption wavelength (λ max ) for orange G was located at 476 nm. 
This peak accounts for the orange colour of solutio ns and can be attributed to the n―π* 
transition of the non-bonding nitrogen electrons to  the antibonding π* group orbital of the 
double bond system and it is used to monitor the de colouris ation of dye. In the UV region, 
there is a second group of bonds, with an increasin g absorbency towards lower 
wavelengths (nm), characteristic of aromatic rings.   Int. J. Chem. Sci.: 6(2), 2008

Effect of pH 
Fenton oxidation is highly pH dependent process. Un der proper pH range, H 2O2
will be decomposed by Fe 2+  to generate hydroxyl radical. Fig. 2 illustrates t he  variation of
concentration of OG (depradation efficiency) for ph oto-Fenton oxidation as a function of 
time at different pH. The experiments were carried out in pH range 1.3 - 9.5.

treatment. Reaction conditions: [dye] o = 50 mg/L, [H 2O2]o = 10 −− −−2 M,  
[Fe 2+ ]o = 5 x 10 –5 M 
The results indicated that the degradation of OG wa s significantly influenced by 
the pH of the solution and the optimal solution pH was observed at about 3. At pH 1.3, the 
dye decolourisation  rate dramatically decreased revealing that the sca venging effect of the 
•OH by H + is severe at low pH. At a pH higher than 3, it als o showed low dye 
decolourization efficiency. It may be explained by the hydrolysis of Fe 3+  in the solution to 
reduce •OH producing rate. 
Effect of initial H 2O2 concentration 
To render the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes com petitive with other p rocesses, 
it is essential that their applications represent a  low cost operation, which basically implies 
a better control of H 2O2 dosage.   Chenini Halima et al.: Decolourization of Azo….

Fig. 3 and 4 show the concentration of OG as a function o f reaction time when 
different concentration of H 2O2 was used. As it can be seen, the effect of increasing 
[H 2O2]o from 10 −4 M to 10 −2 M was first positive for the degradation of OG. Th is is due to 
the oxidation power of Fenton process, which was im proved with increasing •OH radical 
amount in solution obtained from the decomposition of increasing hydrogen peroxide. 
However, with continuous increasing of the [H 2O2]o to 2 x 10 −2 M and 4 x 10 −2 M, the 
degradation rate of OG has been reduced. This may b e explained by the fact that the very 
reactive •OH radical could be consumed by H 2O2 and results in the generation of less 
reactive •OOH radical (Eq. 1)12 ,13 : 
 H 2O2 + •OH → •OOH + H 2O …(1) 
Generally, the degradation rate of organic compound s increases as the H 2O2
concentration increases until a critical H 2O2 concentration is achieved. However, when a 
concentration higher than the critical concentratio n is used, the degradation rate of organic 
compounds will decrease as a result of the so-calle d scavenging effect14, 15 .  
It can be postulated that H 2O2 should be added at an optimum concentration to 
achieve the best degradation; hence, 10 −2 M of H 2O2 concentration appears  to be an 
optimum dosage for 50 mg/L of OG in Fenton and phot o-Fenton processes. 
Effect of the initial Fe 2+  concentration 
Amount of ferrous ion is one of the main parameter  to influence the Fenton and 
photo -Fenton processes. To elucidate the role of initial  concentration of Fe 2+  ([Fe 2+ ]o) on 
the degradation of OG, a series of experiments were  conducted with different [Fe 2+ ]o
ranging from 10 −5 M to 10 −4 M. The results for Fenton and photo- Fenton processes are 
shown in Fig. 5 and 6 . 
From the experimental results, it can be seen that decolourisation  rate of OG 
distinctly increased with the increasing amount of Fe 2+. In the Fenton process, addition of 
Fe 2+  from 10 −5 to 10 4 M increases colour removal from 14.10 % to 96.72 %  at 10  min 
whereas in photo-Fenton process, the increase is fr om 82.92 % to 99. 93 % for the same 
time. This is because more •OH radicals are produced with the increase of [Fe 2+ ]o 
according to Eq. (2). 
 Fe 2+  + H 2O2 + H + →    Fe 3+  + •OH + H 2O2 …(2)

The results show that there is almost no difference  in the degradation efficiency 
between 5 x 10 −5 M and 10 –4 M of Fe 2+  for the dye decolourisation during 10 min. reactio n 
time for photo-Fenton process. Moreover, many studi es have revealed that the use of a 
much higher concentration of Fe 2+  could lead to the self scavenging of •OH radical by Fe 2+ 
(Eq. 3)16  and induce the decrease in degradation rate of poll utants.  
 •OH + Fe 2+  → Fe 3+ + OH – …(3) 
Comparison of photodecolourization between Fenton a nd photo-Fenton process 
Fig. 7 and 8 show the decolourization efficiencies of OG with the variation of H 2O2
and Fe 2+ , respectively for a reaction time of 10 min. 
 
Fig. 7: Comparison between Fenton and photo-Fenton process ( λ irr = 254 nm) after

[H 2O2]o = variable,  pH = 3.0 
The results indicated that the extent of decolouriz ation increases until the optimum 
value of 10 −2 M for H 2O2, either for Fenton or photo- Fenton process. For a bigger value of 
H2O2, it is clear from Fig. 7 that the decolouriz ation efficiencies of OG decreases. This is 
due to the fact that at higher H 2O2 concentration, scavenging of OH radicals  will occur 
(Eq. 1); thus, decreasing the decolourization. As s hown in Fig. 8, the photodegradation 
efficiency of OG distinctly increased with increasi ng amounts of Fe 2+ . Hence, in both the 
process es, the value of the concentration of Fe 2+ (10 −4 M) can be used as optimum dosage.  Chenini Halima et al.: Decolourization of Azo….

 629  
The experimental results in Fig. 9 showed that phot o-Fenton process presents a 
percent removal higher than Fenton process. The  efficiency of the photo- Fenton process is 
due to the increase in hydroxyl radical production in the process. It is possi ble to include 
that the UV lamp is very useful in Fenton process t o aid the dye decolourisation 11, 17 .  
CONCLUSIONS 
The results showed that Fenton and photo- Fenton processes provide good 
performance in the decolourization treatment of OG, but photo- Fenton process is more 
efficient. It has been found that pH, initial conce ntration of H 2O2 and Fe 2+ are the main 
factors that influence the d egradation of OG. The optimum conditions for the 
decolourization were observed at pH = 3.0; with an initial Fe 2+  concentration of 10 −4 M and 
an initial H 2O2 concentration of 10 −2 M with a dye concentration of 50 mg/L. Although 
H2O2 is essential to generate •OH, very high levels of H 2O2 could reduce decolouris ation 
because of scavenging effect.
