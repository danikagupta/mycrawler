ABSTRACT
In the current work, the adsorption of zinc (II) from synthetic solutions by flint and attapulgite clays as natural adsorbents was 
studied in batch experiments under various experimental conditions. The effect of temperature, solution pH, clay dosage, and 
contact time were investigated onto adsorption of metal under studied by flint and attapulgite clays, then perfect conditions 
were determined and applied on industry waste. The adsorption capacity for zinc ion increased with time, and equilibrium 
was reached in 90 minutes in both systems, and the maximum capacity was at pH 4. The adsorption results were assessed 
by two kinetic models (pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order) and three isotherms (Freundlich, Langmuir, and D-R).  
The results revealed which Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order model agreed with the adsorption process. ∆G° 
values in both systems were negative and ranged from (-30.7362 to -26.7212) kJ/mol, indicating that both systems’ adsorption 
processes were spontaneous and physisorption. ΔS° and ΔH° values in both systems were positive, indicating increasing 
randomness and an endothermic system. Perfect conditions were applied on the Al-Quds Power Station sample and showed that 
the removal percentage by attapulgite clay (%R = 99.18) was higher than the removal percentage by flint clay (%R =72.08).

INTRODUCTION
Heavy metals are usually described as metals with densities 
at least five times that of water. Heavy metals are natural 
components of the earth’s surface, and natural processes like 
volcanic activity and weathering play a major role in heavy 
metal contamination. Mining, industrial, agricultural, and 
smelting contribute to an abundant supply of heavy metal 
pollution, either by concentrating or releasing it. Heavy metals 
are used extensively in various manufacturing, agricultural, 
pharmaceutical, and technical applications.1-3 Zinc is among 
the essential heavy metals, and it is used in a variety of 
industrial fields.
On the other hand, zinc is the most toxic contaminant 
entering the aquatic environment through industrial effluent. 
Zinc quantities that are too high cause complications. Migraine, 
atherosclerosis, and pancreas injury are a few examples.4 The 
Health Organization limited the allowed amount of zinc in 
drinkable water to 4 mg/L.5,6
Heavy metal removal processes include adsorption, 
ion exchange, precipitation, evaporation, flocculation, and 
membrane separation. Each process has its pros and cons RESEARCH ARTICLE
regarding sp ecificity, selectivity, sensitivity, and efficiency.7,8 
Adsorption is popular for its low price, operability, and simple 
design, particularly its greater removal efficiency from low 
concentrations.9  
Clay is a natural, earthy substance made up of many tiny 
particles of rock layers that have been studied for its ability to 
absorb trace amounts of metal ions. Clay is primarily composed 
of grained mineral deposits with elastic properties over a wide 
range of water content and solidify if dried. Clay deposits may 
contain organic substances that do not indicate plasticity.10 
Attapulgite is a hydrated magnesium alumino-silicate 
compound made up of octahedral magnesium and tetrahedral 
silicon dioxide.11 It is an excellent potential adsorbent due 
to its environmental friendliness, excellent mechanical 
stability, cheap price, and widespread availability.12 Flint 
clay is described as a crystalline clay (rock) to sedimentary, 
microcrystalline consisting mainly of kaolin that breaks with 
a noticeable conchoidal deformation and resists spilling into 
water.13 
This work aimed to assess adsorption capacity of 
attapulgite and fl int clays in having removed zinc ions from

thermally controlled automatic shaker at various temperatures. 
Zinc ion concentrations in synthetic solutions were measured 
using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer after filtering 
the suspensions using Whatman no 42 filtrates. 
The effects of different process parameters, including 
contact time 10–120 minutes at temperature 298K, initial 
concentration 100 mg/L, and pH 7.3, attapulgite and flint 
clay dosage (0.05–0.9 g) and 0.2–0.8 g, respectively at 
temperature 298k, initial concentration 100 mg/L, and pH = 7.3,  
pH of the solutions 1–7 at temperature 298K, and initial 
concentration 100 mg/L, and temperature (298–328 K) at pH 3,  
and initial concentration 100 mg/L, on Zn (II) adsorption were 
investigated. Then, perfect conditions were determined and 
applied to the industrial wastewater sample. At pH 3, kinetics, 
thermodynamic, and adsorption isotherms parameters were 
determined.
The amount of adsorbed qe (mg/g) and percentage removal 
(% R) for adsorption of Zn (II) ions solutions in equilibrium 
were determined as below:

Whereas C0 (mg.L–1) defines the primary concentration of 
zinc (II), Ce (mg.L–1) defines the concentration of zn (II) at 
equilibrium, V denotes the solution volume in liters, and m (g)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Contact Time Effect
According to experimental data and shapes are seen in Figure 1,  
the zinc (II) adsorption on flint and attapulgite clays reached 
equilibrium in 90 minutes. Adsorption was accompanied by 
a linear increase, corresponding to relatively fast uptake, and 
then a fixed phase. The fast uptake was caused by zinc ions 
collecting rapidly on flint and attapulgite clays.15 Adsorption 
of zinc ion on flint and attapulgite clay took 90 minutes to 
reach equilibrium.
Adsorbents Dosage Effect
Figures 2 and 3 show the effect of the amount of flint and 
attapulgite clays on the adsorption capacity qe (mg/g) 
of Zn (II) ion at 100 mg.L-1 primary concentration. The 
experimental results revealed that as the quantity of adsorbents 
increased, the adsorption capacity of zinc (II) ion decreased 
till a perfect dosage was achieved, after which it stayed synthetic solutions and determine optimum conditions using a 
batch method and applying it to industrial wastewater samples. 
The adsorption data has been subjected to various adsorption 
isotherms, including Langmiur, Freundlich, and D-R. The 
kinetics and thermodynamics for removing zinc ion have been 
investigated.
METHOD AND MATERIALS
Clays Preparation 
The geological survey and mining company (Iraq/Baghdad) 
provided the flint and attapulgite clays. Flint and attapulgite 
clays were washed numerous times by distilled water to 
eliminate soluble substances before drying for 5 hours at 
(350K) and left at room temperature before being collected in 
glass containers. Flint and attapulgite clays were ground and 
sieved with 75 μm size (no. 200) sieves before being collected 
in glass containers. The composition of flint and attapulgite 
clays was determined by the Iraq Geological Survey company, 
as seen in Table 1.
Industry Wastewater Sample Preparation
A sample of industrial wastewater was collected from the 
Al-Quds Power Station, located northeast of Baghdad. 
The sample was digested using the method presented by 
(AL-Shaker and Mohammed).14 The concentration of zinc ions 
in an industrial wastewater sample was (63.97 mg/L). After 
adjusting all of the conditions from the batch experiments 
on synthetic water, we applied the perfect conditions to the 
Al-Quds Power Station sample.
Synthetic Wastewater Preparation
By dissolving 2.084 g of ZnCl2 in 1liter deionized water, a 
standard stock solution of single zinc (II) ions (Conc.1000 
mg/L) was obtained. Distilled water was used to dilute the 
stock solution, which was used to make all operating solutions. 
Zinc (II) concentrations were determined using an atomic 
absorption spectrophotometer (AAS 6200). (Shimadzu, Japan).
Devices
The zinc ion concentration was determined using an atomic 
adsorption spectrophotometer (AAS 6200, Shimadzu, Japan). 
Adsorbent mass and adsorbate pH were measured using a 
German electronic balance and a (WTW) pH 7110 digital 
meter.
Adsorption Studies 
The batch method was used to carry out adsorption 
experiments because of its easiness and dependability. 0.1 and 
0.3 g of attapulgite and flint clays were placed in test tubes  
(100 mL), exposing varying concentrations of 25 mL of 
synthetic solutions of Zn (II). To achieve equilibrium, the

the equilibrium concentration decreases with increasing clay 
amount (adsorbents) for a known initial zinc (II) concentration. 
Perhaps this is caused by rapid increase in surface area and 
the occurrence of as many adsorption binding sites as when 
clay amount (adsorbents) was increased.16 As the weight of the 
adsorbent materials increases, the curves approach a plateau, 
as seen in Figures 2 and 3. This plateau value represents the 
adsorption process’s equilibrium. Attapulgite and flint clays 
have plateaus of 0.1 and 0.4 g, respectively.

Adsorption of zinc (II) ion was assessed, and results were 
dependent on pH, which is directly related to the adsorbent 
kinds, surface charges, and extent of ionization.17 Adsorption 
of zinc (II) ion on attapulgite and flint increased as solution 
pH rose between 1–4 and then lowered at pH.5 The increase in 
pH range 1–4 may be due to reduced competition among both 
(H+1) ions and zinc (II) ions, whereas the reduction in pH (5) 
may be caused by increased competition among both (OH–1) 
ions and zinc (II) ions.18 Maximum percentage removal for 
adsorption of zinc ion was at pH (4) as seen in Figure 4. Many 
experiments also were not produced due to the precipitation 
of Zn (II) ion in solution at pH (9–11).19
Temperature Effect 
Temperature effect on the adsorption capacity of zinc (II) 
ions onto flint and attapulgite clays was investigated at 
various temperatures (298, 308, 318, and 328K), initial zinc 
concentration (100 mg/L), pH (3), contact time 90 minute, and 
flint and attapulgite clays dosage 0.4 and 0.1g respectively. 
Figure 5 shows the general curves and experimental data of 
zinc (II) adsorption onto flint and attapulgite clays. The data 
also revealed which removal efficiency of Zn (II) onto flint and 
attapulgite clays increases with temperature, showing that the 
adsorption system is endothermic, possibly due to increased 
Zn (II) ion diffusion within the crystalline structure of clay 
with the rise of temperature.20Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Zinc (II) Ion Adsorption on Flint and Attapulgite Iraqi ClaysIJDDT, V olume 11 Issue 3, July 2021 - September 2021 Page 751Study of Isotherms
The three most important famous adsorption isotherms, 
Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Langmuir, were 
used to study adsorption behaviors. Freundlich assumed the 
Freundlich equation as followsL.21
 1log log log log log log= +ef eqK Cn (3)
Whereas Kf (mg/g) denotes Freundlich constant and (1/n) 
denotes adsorption intensity. The experimental data was 
fitted with a linear equation by plotting logqe versus log Ce, 
as shown in Figure 6c–d. Langmuir assumed the Langmuir 
equation as follows:22
 
max max11= +e
e
eLCCq Kq q (4)
Whereas qe (mg.g-1) means the capacity of adsorption at 
equilibrium, qmax (mg/g) means maximal capacity of 
adsorption, KL (mg/L) denotes Langmuir constant related to 
the adsorption energy and binding sites affinity, and Ce denotes 
adsorbate concentration at equilibrium. The experimental 
data was fitted with a linear equation via plotting (Ce/qe) 
against Ce, as exposed in Figure 6a and b. The main features 
of Langmuir isotherm could be defined in expressions of 
equilibrium parameter or factor of separation (RL), which can 
be computed by relationship.23
 ()01
1=+L
LRKC (5)
Whereas C0 (mg/L) denotes initial concentration. Depending 
on the value of RL, adsorption kind can be determined as 
irreversible (RL = 0), unfavorable (RL > 1), linear (RL=1), and 
favorable (0 < RL < 1). In this study, RL values of adsorption of zinc (II) ion on flint and attapulgite clays were between  
(0.393-0.600), suggesting that adsorption is favorable.24 
Dubinin assumed the Dubinin equation as follows:25
 2ln ln ln ln= −emqqâå  ln lnqe = ln lnqm – βε2 (6)
The experimental data were fitted with a linear equation by 
plotting lnqe versus ε^2, as shown in Figure 6e–f). Whereas 
qe (mg.g-1) means adsorbate amount at equilibrium, qmax 
(mg.g-1) denotes maximumal capacity of D-R monolayer,  
β (mol2kJ−2) denotes constant linked to sorption energy, and  
ε denotes Polanyi potential linked to equilibrium concentrations 
that the following relationship can calculate:
 ε = RT ln ln 11+
 eC (7)
where R (kJ /K.mol) means gas constant and T (K) means 
temperature.
The following equation calculates the free adsorption 
energy (E).26
 E = (–2β)–0.5  (7)
The D-R model is beneficial for defining adsorption mechanism 
types based on free adsorption energy (E). The Langmuir 
model suggests that maximum possible adsorption appears to 
fit for a packed solute monolayer onto the surface of adsorbent 
materials with no adsorbate-molecule interactions, whereas 
the Freundlich model applies to heterogeneous surfaces of 
adsorbate-molecule interactions. Table 3 shows the three 
isotherms parameters obtained by applying experiment data 
to isotherm models. The adsorption of zinc (II) ions onto flint 
and attapulgite clay were fit with the Freundlich isotherm 
according to R2 values, as shown in Figure 6a to f. The type of 
adsorption (physisorption or chemisorption) is determined by 
the sorption energy (E) value, where (E <16 kJ/mole) indicates 
physisorption and (E > 16 kJ/mole) indicates chemisorption.27

drawn, and isotherm parameters were calculated using data 
from Table 2.
Kinetic Models Study
To determine adsorption rate and expected mechanism of 
zinc (II) ion adsorption on flint and attapulgite clays, pseudo-
first order and pseudo-second-order models were applied to 
adsorption results.
According to Ho and Mckay in 1998, the pseudo-first order 
model is as next.28,29
 ()1 ln ln ln ln−= −et eq q q Kt  (9)
whereas K1 (min.-1) denotes pseudo-first-order rate constant, 
qe(mg.g-1) represents zinc (II) ion amount which adsorb at 
equilibrium, and qt (mg/g) represents zinc (II) ion amount 
which adsorb at the time (t). k1 values and calculated adsorption 
capacity (qe (cal.)) were caculated from slope and intercept of a 
linear plot of ln (qe-qt) against (t). Figure 6-a displays pseudo-
first-order plots, and also pseudo-first-order features are listed 
in Table 4. Correlation coefficient values (R2) listed in table 
4 were extremely low, and the calculated adsorption capacity 
was less than the experimental adsorption capacity, indicating 
which adsorption did not agree with first-order model. 
According to Ho and Mckay in 2000, pseudo second-order 
model is as follows:30
 2
21= +
te ett
qq Kq (10)whereas k2 (g/mg.min) denotes second-order adsorption rate 
constant. k2 values and calculated capacity of adsorption  
(qe (cal.)) were determined from the intercept and slope of a linear 
plot of (t/qt) versus (t). Figure (6b) displays pseudo-second-order 
plots, and also pseudo-first-order features are listed in Table 4. 
Correlation coefficient values (R2) listed in Table 4 were extremely 
high, and the calculated adsorption capacity was equal to the 
experimental adsorption capacity, indicating that adsorption 
agrees with pseudo second-order model (Figure 7a and b).
Parameters of Thermodynamics 
Langmuir constant (KL) is connected to energy of the 
adsorption process. Langmuir model suggests that adsorption 
is based on a single monolayer. Adsorption from a solution to 
a solid can be modeled as a perfect two-dimensional solution 
of solute molecules and solvent, with the solvent and solute 
competition for active positions on clay surfaces.31 The 
equilibrium constant of the adsorption process, K, is related 
to KL, and the water concentration in the aqueous medium is 
C (55.56 mole/L), that is stable in dilute solutions. As a result, 
K could be calculated from the relationship following:32, 33
 =L K CK  (11)
k values can be calculated using the below equation depending 
on KL (L/mg) values listed in Table 3.
 K = 10 0 0 KL × M.Wt of adsorbate  × 55. 56  (12)
Parameters of the thermodynamics (∆G°, ∆H°, and ∆S°) can 
be calculated by using the listed below thermodynamics 
relationships:32, 33

In common, chemisorption have a ∆G° change of -80 to -400

-30.7362 to -26.7212 kJ/mol, indicating which adsorption 
process in all systems was spontaneous and physisorption. 
ΔS° and ΔH° values were positive, indicating increasing 
randomness and an endothermic system.
Apply Perfect Conditions to a Sample of Industrial 
Wastewater
Applied perfect conditions obtained from batch experiments 
on synthetic water for zinc ion on Al-Quds Power Station 
sample. The results showed decreasing zinc ion concentration 
in an industry sample when using attapulgite clay as adsorbent 
from 63.97 to 0.521 mg/L at temperature 328K, pH 4, contact 
time of 90 minutes, and attapulgite dosage of 0.1g (R% =99.18). 
While decreasing zinc ion concentration in an industry sample 
when using flint clay as an adsorbent from 63.97 to 17.83 mg/L 
at temperature 328K, pH 4, contact time of 90 minutes flint 
dosage 0.4g (R% =72.08).
CONCLUSION
The batch adsorption experiments in this study revealed 
that flint and attapulgite clays were efficient, low cost, 
environmentally friendly, and available for removing zinc ion 
from industrial wastewater. The experiment results showed 
that zinc ion adsorption capacity increased with contact time 
and depended on pH, clay dosage, and temperature. The 
adsorption of zinc (II) ions onto flint and attapulgite clay fits 
with the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order model 
according to R2 values. ΔG° and free adsorption energy (E) 
values showed spontaneous adsorption and physisorption in 
all systems. ΔS° and ΔH° values were positive, indicating 
increasing randomness and an endothermic system. Perfect 
conditions were applied on the Al-Quds Power Station sample and showed that the removal percentage by attapulgite clay 
(R% = 99.18) was higher than the removal percentage by flint 
clay (R% =72.08).
